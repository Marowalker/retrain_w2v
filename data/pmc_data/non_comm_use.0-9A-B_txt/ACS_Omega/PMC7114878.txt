As part of the quest for new gold drugs, we have explored the efficacy of three gold complexes
derived from the tuberculosis drug pyrazinamide (PZA), namely, the
gold(I) complex [Au(PPh3)(PZA)]OTf (1, OTf
= trifluoromethanesulfonate) and two gold(III) complexes [Au(PZA)Cl2] (2) and [Au(PZO)Cl2] (3, PZO = pyrazinoic acid, the metabolic product of PZA) against two
mycobacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium smegmatis. Only
complex 1 with the {Au(PPh3)}+ moiety
exhibits significant bactericidal activity against both strains. In
the presence of thiols, 1 gives rise to free PZA and
{Au(PPh3)}-thiol polymeric species. A combination of PZA
and the {Au(PPh3)}-thiol polymeric species appears to lead
to enhanced efficacy of 1 against M. tuberculosis.

Introduction
Gold-based treatment
of various diseases has been around for hundreds
of years.1 This area of research was made
popular in the late 1800s when Robert Koch discovered gold cyanide
to be effective against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB).2 His work inspired numerous others to further research gold as a
possible potent antimicrobial agent. Eventually, the toxicity of gold
compounds halted their clinical use for the treatment of TB but later
became popular for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.3 Auranofin, an antiarthritic drug, was approved
for clinical use in the 1980s and continues to be administered today
along with various other gold compounds.4

The success of auranofin and the rapid increase in drug-resistant
pathogens prompted a surge of new research into gold compounds and
their broad use as antiarthritic, antimicrobial, anticancer, and antifungal
agents.5−7 Gold(III) complexes, sharing the same geometrical
shape as the well-known cancer therapeutic cisplatin, have been evaluated
for their anticancer effect and often show increased activity with
no cross-resistance to cisplatin.8,9 Antimicrobial
gold(I) and (III) complexes have been investigated for their potency
against numerous strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria
showing promising results.6 So far, research
in this area has implied that ligand structures of the gold complexes
play important roles in both their efficacy and toxicity. In particular,
manipulation of ligand structures was shown to affect the passage
of the therapeutics across hydrophobic membranes of target cells to
a significant extent.6,10,11 An important class of gold(I) compounds, those with triphenylphosphine
as ligands, is emerging as effective therapeutics against bacterial
infection10,11 and cancer (Figure 1).12−14 The results of our previous work
on cationic gold(I) triphenylphosphine complexes have implied that
the highly reactive and lipophilic {Au(PPh3)}+ unit plays an important role in their antibacterial activity.11 Although gold(I) complexes have been studied
for their anticancer and antibacterial effectiveness, to our knowledge
only two gold(I) complexes with the {Au(PPh3)}+ unit have so far been evaluated for their antimycobacterial behavior.15,16

Figure 1 Structures
of complexes with the {Au(PPh3)}+ unit that
have shown anticancer (A, B)13,14 and antibacterial (C,
D)10,11 activity.

Recent efforts in drug discovery have demonstrated that combination
of two antipathogenic moieties in one chemotherapeutic often leads
to higher overall efficacy.11−16 It is evident that such a design provides a dual mechanism of action
and potentially increased the effect compared to that of the ligand
or the metal center on its own. Along this line, we have reported
Au(I) and Ag(I) complexes of benzothiazoles that exhibit high antibacterial
activity against Acenetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. Success in these cases prompted
us to explore the possibility of designing new gold(I) complexes comprising
the {Au(PPh3)}+ moiety and the known TB drug
pyrazinamide (PZA). PZA shortens the treatment duration for TB to
a considerable extent although large oral quantities are needed for
such effect.17 We therefore decided to
combine PZA with the {Au(PPh3)}+ unit and study
the synergistic effects (if any) on M. tuberculosis and the possibility of use of lower doses of PZA.

Herein,
we report the syntheses and characterization of one gold(I)
complex [Au(PPh3)(PZA)]OTf (1, OTf = trifluoromethanesulfonate)
and two gold(III) complexes [Au(PZA)Cl2] (2) and [Au(PZO)Cl2] (3, PZO = pyrazinoic acid,
the metabolic product of PZA). The antimycobacterial properties of
these complexes have been evaluated on both M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium smegmatis.

Experimental
Section
General
All reagents and solvents were of commercial
grade and used without further purification. Fourier-transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectra were obtained using a PerkinElmer Spectrum One spectrophotometer. 1H, 13C, 31P, and 19F nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded using a Varian Unity 500 MHz instrument at 298 K.

Syntheses
[Au(PPh3)(PZA)]OTf (1)
A solution
of 72.0 mg (0.28 mmol) of silver trifluoromethanesulfonate (OTf) in
10 mL of methanol was added to a solution of 138.8 mg (0.28 mmol)
of chloro(triphenylphosphine)gold(I) dissolved in 15 mL of chloroform.
Immediately, a suspension of AgCl was formed and the mixture was stirred
for 30 min at room temperature and then filtered through a bed of
celite. To the filtrate, a solution of 34.4 mg (0.28 mmol) of PZA
in 15 mL of methanol/chloroform (1:1) was added, and the mixture was
stirred for 18 h at room temperature. The flask was covered with an
Al foil to protect the reaction mixture from ambient light. Next,
the solvent was removed in vacuo, and the solid was washed with diethyl
ether to obtain 1 as a white solid (112.1 mg, 54%). A
solution of the solid in chloroform was layered with hexanes and stored
in the fridge. X-ray quality crystals of 1 were obtained
after 1 week. Anal. calc. for C24H20AuN3O4PSF3: C, 39.41; H, 2.76; N 5.74; found:

[Au(PZA)Cl2]
(2)
A batch of
32.5 mg (0.26 mmol) of PZA was dissolved in 2 mL of water and the
solution was added dropwise to a solution of 99.7 mg (0.26 mmol) of
potassium tetrachloroaurate in 1.75 mL of water at room temperature
with stirring. A yellow solid appeared quickly, and the suspension
was allowed to stir for an additional 10 min. The precipitate was
filtered, washed with 2 mL of cold water and then 10 mL of cold diethyl
ether to obtain the precursor complex (vide infra) as a bright yellow
solid (90 mg). IR (KBr, cm–1): 3442(m), 1704(s),
1373(m), 1177(w), 560(w). 1H NMR (CD3CN, ppm):
9.53 (s, 1H), 9.07 (d, 1H), 9.05 (d, 1H), 7.68 (b, 1H), 6.60 (b, 1H).
The precursor yellow solid was crystallized by slow evaporation in
methanol to form orange blocks of 2 after 2 weeks. Anal.

152.97, 149.89, 141.50, 138.46.

[Au(PZO)Cl2]
(3)
An aqueous
solution of sodium hydroxide (0.15 M) was used to adjust the pH of
a suspension of 100 mg (0.81 mmol) of PZO in 2 mL of water until a
pH of 7 was reached. At this point, PZO had fully dissolved and the
solution was added dropwise to a solution of 101.5 mg (0.27 mmol)
of potassium tetrachloroaurate in 1 mL of water at room temperature
with stirring. A light yellow precipitate appeared within minutes.
After stirring for an additional 30 min, the solid was filtered, washed
with 2 mL of cold water and then 5 mL of diethyl ether. The light
yellow solid was finally recrystallized from MeOH/ether to yield 3 as a yellow microcrystalline solid (60.2 mg, 55%). X-ray
quality crystals were formed by the layering of acetonitrile/ether.
Anal. calc. for C5H3AuN2O2Cl2: C, 15.36; H, 0.77; N, 7.17; found: C, 15.40; H, 0.81;

X-ray Crystallography
Crystallographic
data were collected
on a Bruker APEX II single-crystal X-ray diffractometer (PHOTON 100
detector) with graphite monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ
= 0.71073 Å) by the ω-scan technique in the range 5.8 ≤
2θ ≤ 53 for (1), 7 ≤ 2θ ≤
50 for (2), and 6.2 ≤ 2θ ≤ 50 for
(3) (Table 1). All data were corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects.18 All of the structures were solved with the aid
of the SHELXT program using intrinsic phasing.19 The structures were then refined by a full-matrix
least-squares procedure on F2 by SHELXL.20 All nonhydrogen atoms
were refined anisotropically. All hydrogen atoms were included in
calculated positions. The absorption corrections are done using SADABS.19 Calculations were performed using the OLEX221 and SHELXTL(22) (V 6.14) program package.

Mycobacterial Studies
M. smegmatis
Middlebrook
7H9 liquid medium23 was inoculated from
a frozen stock of M. smegmatis and
grown overnight to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600)
of 1. Stock solutions of test compounds in acetone (0.02–0.1
mM) were prepared, and batches of 20 μL of such solutions were
added to 250 μL of the bacterial suspensions in 1.73 mL of 7H9
media in 5 mL culture tubes. The tubes were incubated at 37 °C
for 18 h. The MIC values were then determined by reading the OD600 of the suspensions with different concentrations of the
test compounds. To ensure that no viable bacteria remained in such
tubes was confirmed as follows. Aliquots of 100 μL of the suspensions
were added to fresh 7H9 media (1 mL) and incubated at 37 °C for
18 h. In all cases, no bacteria growth was observed. The MIC results
are summarized in Table 3, and all concentrations were performed in triplicate.

M. tuberculosis
A stock
culture of M. tuberculosis was prepared
by inoculation of a 1 mL frozen stock into 50 mL of Middlebrook 7H9
liquid medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) OADC enrichment (BBL Middlebrook
OADC, 212351), 0.5% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.05% (w/v) Tween 80 (P1754,
Sigma-Aldrich) in a roller bottle. Cells were grown to an OD600 of 1.0 to begin the experiments. The culture was then diluted down
to a target OD600 of 0.5 (final OD reading = 0.67). Aliquots
of 100 μL of 8 mM test compound solutions in acetone were added
to batches of 10 mL of the culture suspension (final concentration
of the test compounds = 80 μM in 1% acetone) and the tubes were
then incubated at 37 °C. After 24 h incubation, the OD600 values were recorded. Triplicates were run with each test compound,
and the results are shown in Figure 5.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
Complex 1 was synthesized by
first displacing the chloride ligand from [ClAu(PPh3)]
with the aid of Ag(OTf) and introducing PZA as the second ligand.
Single-crystal analysis of 1 (Figure 2) revealed PZA as a monodentate N-donor ligand.24 The IR spectrum of 1 exhibits a
strong peak centered around 1261 cm–1 corresponding
to the OTf counterion and the carbonyl amide peak of PZA at 1690 cm–1.

Figure 2 Structure of 1 with water and OTf anion omitted
for
clarity. Ellipsoids are shown at the 50% probability level.

Complex 2 (Figure 3, top panel) was not obtained from the initial
reaction
of KAuCl4 and PZA. That reaction afforded the precursor
complex (mentioned above). This precursor complex as shown in Scheme 1 is always the first
product that appears as a bright yellow solid and behaves similarly
to the analogous [AuCl3(pyrazine)] complex.25 Slow evaporation of the methanolic solution
of this precursor complex eventually affords complex 2. Comparison of the IR spectra of the precursor complex and 2 reveals different νCO frequencies
(1704 and 1660 cm–1, respectively) corresponding
to the amide CO group of PZA. Because the νCO of the precursor complex is close to the νCO value of free PZA (1711 cm–1), we
believe that in this complex the PZA ligand is bound to the Au(III)
center in a monodentate fashion (as shown in Scheme 1). In complex 2, the PZA ligand
is bonded as a bidentate ligand (Figure 3) with the deprotonated amide group. Elimination
of HCl from the precursor complex leads to formation of complex 2 in methanolic solution upon long evaporation (Scheme 1). Due to the relatively quick
reaction time (10 min), the precursor material presumably precipitates
out as the kinetically favored species while 2 is the
thermodynamically favored species obtained after recrystallization
from methanol. The assignment is further supported by the fact that
while the precursor complex exhibits two amide NH peaks in its NMR
spectrum (much like free PZA) in CD3CN, complex 2 displays only one NH peak in its NMR spectrum in the same solvent
(Figure 4). Also the
precursor complex, like [AuCl3(pyrazine)], readily loses
the N-donor ligand in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-d6 (as evidenced by NMR spectra).25 We hypothesize that in the precursor complex, PZA is bound to the
Au(III) center at the N atom meta to the carboxamide group (as observed
in complex 1) simply because this N center is the most
basic site of the PZA molecule.26 Conversion
of the precursor complex to 2 is accelerated by the addition
of NaHCO3 in a 1:1 MeOH/water reaction mixture, a step
that pushes the reaction shown in Scheme 1 to the right.

Scheme 1 Suggested Ligand Binding Mode Rearrangement from the Precursor Complex
(Left) to 2
PZO, the purported metabolic product actually responsible for the
drug action of PZA, also binds the Au(III) center as a bidentate ligand
(Figure 3, bottom panel).
Addition of excess deprotonated PZO to KAuCl4 in the aqueous
medium affords complex 3 in high yield.

Structures
Structures of 1–3 were characterized
by X-ray crystallography and the perspective
views (with atom labeling schemes) are shown in Figures 2 and 3, while the
structure refinement parameters and selected bond distances and angles
are listed in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. For the sake of comparison
of the metric parameters, the two Au(III) complexes (2 and 3) are shown in Figure 3. As evident from their crystal structures,
the Au(I) complex 1 exhibits a linear coordination, while
the two Au(III) complexes are square planar. In the structure of 1, there is one molecule of water in the asymmetric unit,
while the other two structures contain no solvent of crystallization.
The N(1)–Au(1)–P(1) angle in 1 deviates
slightly from linearity with an angle of 177.8(2)°. The Au–N(pyridine)
(2.081(7) Å) bond is shorter than Au–P (2.244(2) Å)
bond as expected. Similar bond lengths and angles are observed in
other known structures of Au(I) complexes of [(N-bound ligand)Au(PPh3)]-type.11,14 The three nitrogen atoms on PZA
potentially allow for three different binding modes to the {Au(PPh3)}+ unit in 1; however, the least
sterically hindered and most basic N of PZA shows preference to the
metal center, as shown in Figure 1.26

Au(III) complexes 2 and 3 are both distorted
square planar and composed of the PZA/PZO ligand bound as a bidentate
ligand. The square planar geometries of 2 and 3 deviate noticeably from planarity with N(2)–Au(1)–N(3)
and N(2)–Au(1)–O(2) angles of 80.51(16) and 82.7(2)°,
respectively. The Cl(1)–Au(1)–Cl(2) angles of both structures
deviate only slightly from the perfect right angle values 90.75(5)
and 90.68(7)°, respectively. As expected, the deprotonated Au(1)–N(3)
or Au(1)–O(2) of 2 and 3 are significantly
shorter than the Au(1)–N(2) bonds shown in Table 2. Bond lengths and angles are
in agreement with similar known structures of Au(III)-picolinamide
and picolinic acid derivatives.27,28

In 2, the equatorial plane comprised of Au(1), N(2),
N(3), Cl(1), Cl(2) atoms is fairly planar with a mean deviation of
0.041(3) Å, while the corresponding plane in 3 (comprised
of Au(1), O(2), N(2), Cl(1), Cl(2) atoms) is highly planar with a
mean deviation of 0.011(3) Å. The central metal atom in 2 and 3 is deviated from these planes by 0.009(3)
and 0.022(3) Å, respectively. The two chelate planes formed by
the bidentate PZA and PZO ligands along with Au(III) centers in 2 (Au(1), N(2), N(3), C(1), and C(5)) and 3 (Au(1),
N(2), O(2), C(1), and C(5)) exhibit minimal deviation from planarity
(mean deviations, 0.01(3)1 and 0.019(3) Å for 2 and 3, respectively). The dihedral angles between the pyrazine
ring and the five-membered chelate ring in 2 and 3 are 3.18(2) and 1.83(2)°, respectively. In an Au(III)
complex with picolinamide as a ligand, which structurally resembles
closely to that of complex 2, the dihedral angle between
the pyridine ring and the five-membered chelate ring is 3.6(2)°,
which is close to the corresponding value noted for 2.27 Moreover, the mean deviations of the
chelate ring are similar to those in 2. However, a reported
Au(III) complex with a picolinic acid derivative as the ligand resembles
structurally more to complex 3, and the dihedral angle
between the pyridine ring and the five-membered chelate ring is 1.28(2)°.28

Mycobacterial Activity
Before studying
the potential
synergistic effects of PZA and gold on M. tuberculosis, the antimicrobial effects of the Au center alone were studied on M. smegmatis. This bacterium is in the same genus
as M. tuberculosis and has 2000 genes
highly conserved with the pathogen. Thus, M. Smegmatis is an excellent model organism that is easy to work with, has a
fast growth rate, and a relatively safer model.23,29M. Smegmatis is known to be naturally
resistant to PZA and thus provides an opportunity to study the activity
of the {Au(I)(PPh3)}+ and {Au(III)Cl2}+ moieties of 1–3. In
the present work, the activities of 1–3, [ClAu(PPh3)], PZA, and a drug control isoniazid (INH)
were tested against M. smegmatis in
a normal growth environment and the results are summarized in Table 3. Under our conditions, we found the MIC to be 60 μM
for 1 and [ClAu(PPh3)], while 2, 3, and PZA showed no activity up to 100 μM.
Mycobacteria species are known to have thick, hydrophobic, and waxy
membranes that prevent foreign substances from permeation more so
than traditional Gram-positive and Gram-negative species.30,31 For this reason, the lipophilic {Au(PPh3)}+ unit in 1 might have been able to pass through this
membrane and exert drug action. This conclusion is supported by the
fact that cell digests from M. smegmatis cells exposed to 40 μM (below the MIC) of 1 exhibited
strong inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) signal(s)
for gold. Also, the gold(III) species 2 and 3 with chloro ligands but no {Au(PPh3)}+ moiety
were not active at similar concentrations.

With results
from M. Smegmatis study
in hand, we proceeded to test the activity of complex 1 against M. tuberculosis in vitro
along with [ClAu(PPh3)], PZA, and isoniazid (INH). The
OD of M. tuberculosis was recorded
after 24 h incubation with 80 μM of each compound in 1% acetone
(Figure 5). Interestingly, 1 showed significant
bactericidal activity (reduction in OD), while PZA on its own was
only mildly bacteriostatic (OD less than the control but higher than
day 0). The mild drug action of PZA against M. tuberculosis at the 80 μM concentration is expected since the higher concentration
of PZA (up to 400 μM) and low pH (5.5) media are usually required
to observe any effect on M. tuberculosis growth in vitro.32 The results shown
in Figure 5 strongly
suggest that the {Au(PPh3)}+ moiety of 1 augments the efficacy of PZA in vitro. The standard [ClAu(PPh3)] was specifically included in this study to determine if 1 would show increased activity compared to a compound with
the {Au(PPh3)}+ moiety without PZA. Inspection
of Figure 5 reveals
that both 1 and [ClAu(PPh3)] exhibited the
greatest reduction in OD at very similar average values of 0.345 and
0.387, respectively. Collectively, these results suggest that complex 1 could introduce a dose of PZA as well as the {Au(PPh3)}+ moiety in one combination and act as a “two-in-one”
drug against M. tuberculosis. Ultimately,
this might reduce the need for much higher doses of PZA itself, which
has severe side effects on humans. The gold–phosphine unit
is not so uncommon in metallodrug therapy; Auranofin, an FDA-approved
drug for rheumatoid arthritis, does contain a {Au(PEt3)}+ unit.4

and acetone (Ace).

PZA plays an important
role in shortening TB treatment duration
from 9–12 months to 6 months. This is likely because PZA targets
a population of semidormant bacilli residing within the macrophages
in an environment not accessible to other TB drugs.32,33 The mechanism of action of the pro-drug PZA is not entirely understood,
but most agree that the conversion of PZA to PZO within the bacilli
is critical for activity against M. tuberculosis. Interestingly, PZO itself is not as active as PZA against M. tuberculosis. PZA has a broad range of activity
highly dependent on the pH of the media and because it targets mostly
nonreplicating bacilli, PZA exhibits slow or no bactericidal activity
in vitro.32 This occurrence is likely the
reason why no synergy was observed in our hands. Nevertheless, PZA
has had a significant clinical impact on TB and therefore research
toward modifying PZA with the additional antimycobacterial moiety
might lead to new and improved outcomes.

Solution studies
The results of 1H NMR studies
confirm that 1–3 are stable in acetone,
while 2 and 3 are also stable in acetonitrile.
Complexes 2 and 3 are stable in aqueous
acetone (90:10) for hours, while 1 slowly decomposes
in such solutions (used in biological studies). However, inside biologically
relevant environments, exposure to sulfur-containing biomolecules
like glutathione is expected. Gold(I) centers are soft Lewis acids,
and it is well established that they prefer binding to soft Lewis
bases like thiolate species. The binding of gold(I) species to biologically
relevant thiols (such as glutathione) and enzymes with thiol-containing
active sites (such as thioredoxin) has been observed and the exchange
of N- and S-bound ligands occurs quickly compared to P-bound ligands.14,34 This exchange has been hypothesized to play an important role in
the anticancer effects of [N–Au(PPh3)] complexes14 as well as the antimycobacterial effects exhibited
by auranofin.35 Disruption of redox homeostasis
within the bacterial cell following binding of the gold unit to glutathione
or thioredoxin has been suggested to be responsible for the drug action.
Impairment of protein synthesis in bacteria has also been observed
with auranofin treatment.36 In our previous
work, we have showed that complexes with N-bound benzothiazole ligands
and the {Au(PPh3)}+ moiety rapidly exchange
with thiol species.11 In the present work,
we checked the possibility of exchange between PZA and biologically
relevant thiols in the case of 1. Both 1H
and 19F NMR spectra of the mixture of 1 and
4-(trifluoromethyl)thiophenol (FTP) were recorded to observe if PZA
does get exchanged with FTP (Figure 6). As shown in Figure 6 (left panel), addition of FTP to 1 showed
release of PZA as a free ligand (as evident in the 1H NMR,
not shown) with multiple new 19F NMR peaks (Figure 6A, bottom) along with a white
precipitate. Together, these results indicate the formation of {S–Au(PPh3)}-polymeric species by 1 in the presence of
a thiol. We hypothesize that such a transformation will lead to the
presence of both PZA and {Au(PPh3)}+ units,
which will exert their own individual and potentially synergistic
actions. In contrast, [ClAu(PPh3)] does not appear to react
with FTP and form any Au–thiol species (Figure 6A, middle panel). In the acidic (pH 6.2–4.5)
macrophage compartment,37 replacement of
Cl– by a thiol is highly unlikely. Thus, administration
of 1 (compared to [ClAu(PPh3)]) could be more
reactive against M. tuberculosis residing
within the macrophages in vivo. We have also employed a more biologically
relevant thiol, namely, N-acetyl l-cysteine
methyl ester, to check this interpretation. Addition of N-acetyl l-cysteine methyl ester to 1 resulted
in the immediate appearance of a white precipitate (Figure 6B, right), but no such reaction
was observed with [ClAu(PPh3)] (Figure 6B, left). Collectively, these results suggest
that formation of {S–Au(PPh3)}-polymeric species
with 1 within biological targets might promote uptake
by host macrophages, similar to the uptake of Au nanoparticles38,39 and/or breakdown of cellular thiol-redox homeostasis.35 Since M. tuberculosis is either contained by macrophages or reside within them, this process
could offer a more direct route to TB treatment in a host system.
The {S–Au(PPh3)}-polymeric species derived from 1, along with PZA, could cause more damage to the mycobacterium
residing within the macrophages and thus increasing the efficacy of
the treatment.

Conclusions
While Au complexes have been evaluated
for their antimycobacterial
effects previously,40−43 extensive literature search reveals only two other complexes containing
the {Au(PPh3)}+ unit (Figure 7) in such testing.15,16 Also, in a previous study, the auranofin containing PEt3 moiety has been shown to exert potent activity against M. tuberculosis.35 Between
the two complexes with the {Au(PPh3)}+ unit,
the one with the acridine moiety as a ligand (Figure 7, left) was screened against M. tuberculosis, while the other with sulfadiazine
as a ligand (Figure 7, right) was tested against other members of the mycobacterium genus.
The sulfadiazine–Au(PPh3) complex showed synergy
of the sulfadiazine antibiotic with the {Au(PPh3)}+ unit. We expect that similar synergy between PZA and the
{Au(PPh3)}+ moiety (arising from 1) could increase the efficacy of the treatment compared to PZA alone
under in vitro conditions.

that have been evaluated for their antimycobacterial activity.15,16

Current TB treatment regimens
require four orally taken drugs (PZA,
ethambutol, rifampicin, isoniazid) at high dosages for 6 months with
the daily dose of PZA recommended at 30 mg/kg for at least 2 of those
months.17 Much of the difficulty of treatment
for this disease arises from both the inherent thick, waxy mycomembrane
(preventing foreign substances from permeation) of M. tuberculosis and the success to survive within
host macrophages.30,31 Complexes like 1, as evidenced by our results, may react immediately with biologically
relevant thiols to produce free PZA and {Au(PPh3)–thiol}
polymeric species. The {Au(PPh3)}+ moiety of 1 may provide the lipophilicity required to pass through the
mycomebrane to exert its action, while a dose of PZA is also provided
simultaneously. So far, the success of PZA in the TB treatment has
been an extremely valuable finding; further investigation into the
possible synergistic effects between PZA (or other TB drugs) and the
{Au(PPh3)}+ moiety in vivo could be valuable
toward identifying new drugs, especially for future treatment of emerging
drug-resistant strains. Such studies are in progress in this laboratory.
