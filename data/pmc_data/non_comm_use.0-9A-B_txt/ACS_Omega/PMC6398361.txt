The
main focus of this article is on mixture separations that are
driven by differences in intracrystalline diffusivities of guest molecules
in microporous crystalline adsorbent materials. Such “kinetic”
separations serve to over-ride, and reverse, the selectivities dictated
by mixture adsorption equilibrium. The Maxwell–Stefan formulation
for the description of intracrystalline fluxes shows that the flux
of each species is coupled with that of the partner species. For n-component mixtures, the coupling is quantified by a n × n dimensional matrix of thermodynamic
correction factors with elements Γij; these elements can be determined from the model used to describe
the mixture adsorption equilibrium. If the thermodynamic coupling
effects are essentially ignored, i.e., the Γij is assumed to be equal to δij, the Kronecker delta, the Maxwell–Stefan formulation degenerates
to yield uncoupled flux relations. The significance of thermodynamic
coupling is highlighted by detailed analysis of separations of five
different mixtures: N2/CH4, CO2/C2H6, O2/N2, C3H6/C3H8, and hexane isomers. In all cases,
the productivity of the purified raffinate, containing the tardier
species, is found to be significantly larger than that anticipated
if the simplification Γij = δij is assumed. The reason for the strong influence
of Γij on transient breakthroughs
is traceable to the phenomenon of uphill intracrystalline diffusion
of more mobile species. The major conclusion to emerge from this study
is that modeling of kinetic separations needs to properly account
for the thermodynamic coupling effects.

1 Introduction
Most
commonly, the driver for mixture separations in fixed-bed
adsorbers is the selectivity based on mixture adsorption equilibrium.
Industrially important examples of such equilibrium-based separations
include H2 purification, production of purified oxygen,
and separation of xylene isomers.1−8 However, there are practical instances of kinetic separations in
which diffusional effects over-ride the influence of mixture adsorption
equilibrium and are the prime driver for separations;9 examples include production of N2 from air and
removal of N2 from natural gas.2−4

In recent
years, there has been substantial progress in the development
of novel materials for industrially important separations10 that are primarily driven by diffusion selectivities
and size exclusion. For industrially important separation of C2H4/C2H6 mixtures, the pore
dimensions of UTSA-280, an ultra-microporous molecular sieve [Ca(C4O4)(H2O)], are tuned to only allow C2H4 to enter the channels, resulting in almost total
exclusion of the saturated alkane.11 Pimentel
and Lively12 demonstrate the potential
of ZIF-8/cellulose acetate fiber sorbents for the kinetic separation
of C3H6/C3H8 mixtures.
Several other examples of kinetic separations are discussed in the
review by Wang and Zhao.13

For the
design and development of pressure swing adsorption (PSA)
technologies exploiting diffusion-selective separations, it is of
vital importance to use mathematical models for transient uptakes
and breakthroughs in fixed adsorbers that properly describe both mixture
adsorption equilibrium and the intracrystalline diffusion characteristics.14 Commonly, the ideal adsorbed solution theory
(IAST)15 is the appropriate model to describe
mixture adsorption equilibrium.9 In the
simple case of single-site Langmuir isotherms, with equal saturation
capacities of guest species, the IAST degenerates to yield the mixed-gas
Langmuir model 1  In eq 1, pi are the component partial
pressures, qi are the component loadings
defined in terms of moles per kg of framework, qi,sat are the saturation capacities, and bi are Langmuir binding constants, with units
of Pa–1.

The most practical approach to modeling n-component
diffusion in porous materials is the Maxwell–Stefan (M–S)
formulation that has its basis in irreversible thermodynamics. The
M–S formulation relates the intracrystalline molar fluxes Ni to the chemical potential gradients16−20 2  In eq 2, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, ρ represents the framework density of
the microporous crystalline material, r is the radial
distance coordinate, and the component loadings qi are defined in terms of moles per kg of framework. The xi in eq 2 are the component mole fractions of the adsorbed phase within
the micropores 3  Đi characterize
and quantify the interaction between species i and
pore walls. The advantage of using eq 2 is that the M–S diffusivity Đi equals the corresponding diffusivity for a unary
system, determined at the same pore occupancy.19 Furthermore, the M–S diffusivity Đi for any species i in a mixture
remains invariant to the choice of the partner(s) species.19

Đij,
defined in the first right
member of eq 2, reflect
how the facility for transport of species i correlates
with that of species j. The Onsager reciprocal relations
demand the symmetry constraint 4  The magnitude of Đi relative to that of Đij determines the extent to which the flux of species i is influenced by the driving force of species j. The degree of correlations, defined by Đi/Đij, is governed by a wide variety of factors such
as pore size, channel topology, and connectivity.21,22 Generally speaking, the tardier-more-strongly-adsorbed species will
have the effect of slowing down the more-mobile-less-strongly-adsorbed
partner in the mixture.21 In other words,
the presence of the first term on the right of eq 2 serves to reduce the differences in the effective
mobilities of the constituent species within the pores. Therefore,
correlation effects are undesirable for kinetic separations that seek
to exploit the differences in the mobilities. In practice, we aim
to select materials for which Đi/Đij → ∞ is a good approximation and the first right
member of eq 2 can be
ignored, resulting in 5  Examples of materials for which the flux expression 5 provides a good description of intracrystalline
fluxes are cage-type structures such as CHA, DDR, ERI, LTA, and ZIF-8
that have narrow windows in the 3–4.2 Å size range.23 In such structures, the windows allow the intercage
hopping of only one molecule at a time; consequently, the jumps are
practically uncorrelated.24

The chemical
potential gradients ∂μi/∂r can be related to the gradients
of the molar loadings, qi, by defining
the thermodynamic correction factors Γij 6  The thermodynamic correction factors Γij can be calculated by differenting the model
describing the mixture adsorption equilibrium,25 such as eq 1. Combining eqs 5 and 6, we get 7  Finite magnitudes of the off-diagonal elements
Γij (i ≠ j) cause the flux of species i to be also
influenced by the gradient of the molar loading of species j.26 To appreciate the significance
of such thermodynamic “coupling”, Figure 1 presents the calculations of the thermodynamic
correction factors Γij for 50:50
C3H6(1)/C3H8(2) mixture
adsorption within the crystals of all-silica CHA zeolite at 353 K.
We note that at a total pressure of 100 kPa, the cross-coefficients
are about 60–80% of the magnitudes of the diagonal elements,
indicating that thermodynamic coupling effects are extremely significant.

within the crystals of all-silica CHA at 353 K. Further details and
input data are provided in Chapter 9 of the Supporting Information.

In the Henry regime of
adsorption, at low pore occupancies, Γij → δij, the Kronecker delta,
and eq 7 degenerates
to yield a set of n uncoupled
flux expressions27 8  Even though eq 8 is strictly valid at low pore occupancies, a large
number of implementations of intracrystalline diffusion in models
for fixed-bed adsorbers ignore the contribution of Γij; see the comprehensive review of Shafeeyan
et al.28 The primary objective of this
article is to investigate and highlight the strong influence of thermodynamic
coupling effects, engendered by Γij (i ≠ j), on the effectiveness
of kinetic separations. We aim to show that the use of the simpler
uncoupled flux expression 8 often leads to significant
errors in the prediction of recoveries and productivities of the purified
raffinate during the adsorption cycle of PSA operations. To meet our
objective, we investigate the kinetically driven separation of five
different mixtures N2/CH4, CO2/C2H6, O2/N2, C3H6/C3H8, and hexane isomers. In each case,
we compare the separation effectiveness predicted by breakthrough
simulations incorporating eqs 7 and 8.

The Supporting Information accompanying

modeling of the transient breakthroughs in fixed-bed adsorbers, with
incorporation of the IAST and the Maxwell–Stefan diffusion
formulations, (b) input data on unary isotherms, and M–S diffusivities,
for each of the five cases studies investigated, and (c) structural
details of the zeolites and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs).

2 Modeling Transient Uptakes and Breakthroughs
For an n-component gas mixture flowing through
a fixed-bed adsorber maintained under isothermal, isobaric conditions,
the molar concentrations in the gas phase at any position and instance
of time are obtained by solving the following set of partial differential
equations for each of the species i in the gas mixture4,18,26 9  In eq 9, t is
the time, z is the distance along the adsorber, ε
is the bed
voidage, Dax is the axial dispersion coefficient, v is the interstitial gas velocity, and  is the spatially averaged molar loading
within the crystallites of radius rc,
monitored at position z and at time t.18 Ruthven et al.4 state, “when mass transfer resistance is significantly greater
than axial dispersion, one may neglect the axial dispersion term and
assume plug flow”. The assumption of plug flow is appropriate
for kinetically controlled separations and is invoked in all the simulation
results presented in this article.

The radial distribution of
molar loadings, qi, is obtained from a
solution of a set of differential equations
describing the transient uptake within a spherical crystallite of
radius rc 10  The intracrystalline fluxes Ni, in turn, are related to the radial gradients
in
the molar loadings by eq 7. At any time t, the component loadings at the surface
of the particle qi(rc, t) = qi* is in equilibrium with the bulk phase gas mixture.29 The loadings qi* are determined by the
IAST or mixed-gas Langmuir model, as appropriate.30

At any time t, during the transient
approach to
thermodynamic equilibrium, the spatial-averaged component loading
within the crystallites of radius rc is
calculated using 11  In all of
the simulations reported in this
article, the entire bed of crystalline particles is considered to
be devoid of adsorbates at time t = 0, i.e., we have
the initial condition 12  At time, t = 0, the inlet
to the adsorber, z = 0, is subject to a step input
of the feed gas mixture, with inlet partial pressures pi0, and this step input is maintained till
the end of the adsorption cycle when steady-state conditions are reached. 13  Combination of the discretized partial differential
equations along with the algebraic equations describing mixture adsorption
equilibrium (IAST or mixed-gas Langmuir model) results in a set of
differential–algebraic equations, which are solved using a
sparse matrix solver based on the semi-implicit Runge–Kutta
method;30 further numerical details are
provided in the Supporting Information.

Validation of the simulation methodology for transient uptakes
and breakthroughs by comparison with published experimental works
is available in earlier works.9,18,29,31−34 As an illustration, Figure 2 presents the experimental
data of Jolimaître et al.35 for
transient breakthrough of a ternary mixture of 2-methylbutane (2MB),
2-methylpentane (2MP), and 2,2-dimethylbutane (22DMB) at 473 K in
a fixed bed packed with MFI zeolite that has a topology consisting
of a set of intersecting straight channels and zig-zag channels approximately
5.5 Å in size.8 Branched alkanes are
located preferentially at the channel intersections. The hierarchy
of adsorption strengths is 2MP > 22DMB > 2MB, whereas the diffusion
hierarchy is 2MB > 2MP ≫ 22DMB. Due to the diffusional penalty,
22DMB breaks through earlier than the more mobile 2MB. The experimental
breakthroughs are quantitatively captured by simulations that adopt
the flux expressions including Γij.18 If the assumption Γij = δij is invoked,
the agreement is significantly worse.18 Similar good agreement of the breakthrough simulations based on eq 7 is obtained for the complete
set of seven experimental runs, with different entering feed mixture
compositions, using the same set of isotherm and diffusivity parameters;18 details are provided in Chapter 10 of the Supporting Information.

et al.35 for 2MB/2MP/22DMB ternary mixtures

are simulations based on eq 7. The dashed lines are the simulations based on eq 8. Further details and input data
are provided in Chapter 10 of the Supporting Information, which also contains the rationale for ignoring correlation effects.

3 Results and Discussions on
Five Mixture Separations
3.1 Separation of N2/CH4 Mixtures
Many natural gas reserves contain
nitrogen in
concentrations ranging to about 20%.36 To
meet pipeline specifications, the nitrogen level must be reduced to
below 4%.37 A large majority of nitrogen
removal facilities use cryogenic distillation, but such units are
economical only for large-capacity wells. For smaller reserves, PSA
technology has economic benefits, especially because the feed mixtures
are available at high pressures.36−38 It is desirable to use
adsorbents in PSA units that are selective to N2. For most
known adsorbents, the selectivity for the separation of N2/CH4 mixtures is in favor of CH4 due to its
higher polarizability.18

In a classic
paper published in 1958, Habgood39 reported
experimental data on transient uptake of N2(1)/CH4(2) mixtures in crystallites of LTA-4A zeolite at 194 K. The data
measured with partial pressures (a) p1 = 50.9 kPa, p2 = 49.1 kPa and (b) p1 = 10 kPa, p2 =
90 kPa are shown in Figure 3a,b.40 The nitrogen molecule has
a “pencil-like” shape with dimensions of 4.4 Å
× 3.3 Å; it can hop length-wise across the narrow 4.1 Å
× 4.5 Å 8-ring windows of LTA-4A.41 The methane molecule is spherical with dimensions of 3.7 Å;
it is much more severely constrained and has a diffusivity that is
22 times lower than that of N2.29,42 The adsorption strength of CH4 is higher than that of
N2 by a factor 2.2. During the early stages of the transient
uptake process, the pores of LTA-4A are significantly richer in the
more mobile N2. With increasing time, the nitrogen contained
within the pores is progressively displaced by the more strongly adsorbed,
tardier CH4 molecules.18 The
net result is an overshoot in the N2 uptake in both experimental
uptake campaigns. The continuous solid lines in Figure 3a,b are uptake simulations based on eq 7; these simulations successfully
capture the overshoot in the uptake of the more mobile N2. The dashed lines are the simulations based on eq 8, ignoring thermodynamic coupling, i.e., Γij = δij; in this scenario, no N2 overshoot is experienced. The
attainment of supraequilibrium loadings of N2 during the
early transience signals the phenomena of uphill diffusion, which
can be exploited to achieve kinetic separations in fixed-bed adsorption
devices.7,20,29

data of Habgood39 on transient uptake of
N2(1)/CH4(2) mixture

The continuous solid lines are simulations based on eq 7. The dashed lines are simulations
based on eq 8. Further
details and input data are provided in Chapter 6 of the Supporting Information.

Figure 3c
shows
the transient breakthrough simulations for 20:80 N2/CH4 mixtures through fixed-bed adsorber packed with LTA-4A crystals
operating at 194 K and total pressure pt = 100 kPa.29 The x-axis
is the dimensionless time, τ = tv/L, obtained by dividing the actual time, t, by the
characteristic time, L/v, where L is the length of the adsorber.5,6,30 The continuous solid lines are simulations
based on eq 7; the dashed
lines are simulations based on eq 8. For the target purity of CH4 is 96%, corresponding
to prescribed pipeline specification, we can determine the moles of
96% + pure CH4 produced. Expressed per kg of LTA-4A zeolite
in the packed bed, the respective productivities are 0.09 and 0.002
mol kg–1. Ignoring the thermodynamic coupling effects
severely underestimates the separation performance by a factor of
about 50.

N2/CH4 separations with LTA-4A
zeolite are
effective only at low temperatures, and other materials such as Ba-ETS-4
and clinoptilolites are more suitable for kinetic separations at ambient
conditions.3,36−38 The experimental
data of Majumdar et al.43 on transient
uptake of N2/CH4 mixtures in Ba-ETS-4 show overshoots
in N2 loading, confirming the manifestation of uphill diffusion
and thermodynamic coupling effects.18,29

3.2 Separation of CO2/C2H6 Mixtures
The separation of CO2/C2H6 mixtures
is relevant in the context of natural
gas processing. Current technologies for CO2/C2H6 separations use extractive distillation because of
CO2/C2H6 azeotrope formation.44 Another alternative is to combine distillation
technology with membrane separations; for this purpose, cross-linked
poly(ethylene oxide) membranes have demonstrated to have good separation
potential.45−47

Figure 4a–c shows the experimental data of Binder et al.48 and Lauerer et al.49 for spatial-averaged transient uptake of (a) 1:1, (b) 2:1, and (c)
3:1 CO2/C2H6 gas mixtures within
the crystals of DDR zeolite at 298 K.9 The
DDR zeolite consists of cages of 277.8 Å3 volume separated
by 3.65 Å × 4.37 Å 8-ring windows.41,50 Both guest molecules, CO2 and C2H6, jump length-wise across the 8-ring windows of the DDR zeolite.51 The cross-sectional dimension of CO2 is smaller than that of C2H6,5 and therefore, the intracrystalline M–S diffusivity
of CO2 is significantly higher than that of C2H6 by about 2–3 orders of magnitude; for further
details, see Chapter 7 of the Supporting Information.

Experimental data of Binder et al.48 and
Lauerer et al.49 (indicated

mixtures within the crystals of DDR zeolite at 298 K.9,29 (b) Transient breakthrough of 1:1 CO2/C2H6 mixtures through fixed-bed adsorber packed with DDR crystals
operating at 298 K and total pressure pt = 40 kPa. The continuous solid lines in are simulations based on eq 7. The dashed lines are
simulations based on eq 8. Further details and input data are provided in Chapter 7 of the Supporting Information.

The Maxwell–Stefan flux expression including thermodynamic
coupling quantitatively captures the overshoots in CO2 loadings
with good accuracy for all three experiments.29 If thermodynamic coupling effects are ignored and the assumption
Γij = δij is invoked, no overshoots in CO2 uptake are experienced,
and the simulations show poor agreement with experiments during the
early transience.29

Figure 4d shows
the transient breakthrough simulations for 1:1 CO2/C2H6 mixtures through fixed-bed adsorber packed with
DDR crystals operating at 298 K and total pressure pt = 40 kPa.29 Assuming that
target purity of C2H6 is 90%, we can determine
the moles of more than 90% pure C2H6 produced.
The productivities of more than 90% pure C2H6 are 0.18 and 0.054 mol kg–1, respectively, for
the two scenarios in which thermodynamic coupling is accounted for,
or ignored. Ignoring the thermodynamic coupling effects underestimates
the separation performance by a factor of about three.

3.3 Separation of O2/N2 Mixtures
For the production of purified N2 from air, it is desirable
to have an adsorbent that is selective to O2, which constitutes
21% of the feed mixture; purified N2 can be recovered as
a raffinate during the initial transience of the adsorption cycle.4,18,52 However, for most adsorbents,
the mixture adsorption equilibrium is in favor of N2, which
has a higher quadrupole moment compared to O2. Oxygen-selective
separations are achieved with LTA-4A zeolite and carbon molecular
sieve (CMS); in these materials, O2 has higher diffusivity
due to its smaller size.3,53−56

Simulations of transient uptake of O2/N2 mixture in LTA-4A zeolite at 298 K and total pressure of 600 kPa,
display an overshoot in the O2 uptake (see Figure 5a). The overshoot in the O2 loading disappears with the simplification Γij = δij. The experimental
data of Chen et al.55 for transient O2/N2 uptake in CMS also show an overshoot in the
O2 uptake, confirming the occurrence of uphill diffusion
and attainment of supraequilibrium O2 loadings for a short
time span.20,29

Figure 5 (a) Transient uptake of O2(1)/N2(2) mixture
in LTA-4A zeolite at 298 K and total pressure of 600 kPa. The partial
pressures of the components in the bulk gas phase are p1 = 126 kPa and p2 = 474 kPa.

at a total pressure of 600 kPa and 298 K. The partial pressures of
the components in the bulk gas phase at the inlet are p1 = 126 kPa and p2 = 474 kPa.
The continuous solid lines are simulations based on eq 7. The dashed lines are simulations
based on eq 8. Further
details and input data are provided in Chapter 8 of the Supporting Information.

Figure 5b
presents
transient breakthrough simulations for a fixed-bed operating at 298
K and total pressure of 600 kPa. For an assumed target purity of more
than 95% N2, we can determine the moles of more than 95%
pure N2 produced; expressed per kg of LTA-4A zeolite in
the packed bed, the productivities are 0.066 and 0.036 mol kg–1 for the respective models including and ignoring
thermodynamic coupling influences. Ignoring thermodynamic coupling
effects underestimates the separation performance by a factor of 50%.

3.4 Separation of C3H6/C3H8 Mixtures
Cryogenic distillation of
C3H6/C3H8 mixtures is
the currently used technology for making polymer-grade propene with
more than 99.5% purity. Propane of more than 90% purity is used for
various purposes such as fuel for engines, oxy-gas torches, and barbecues;
this can be obtained as the bottoms product of the cryogenic distillation
column.57 The boiling points are close
to each other: propene (226 K) and propane (231.3 K). Consequently,
the distillation columns are some of the largest and tallest distillation
columns used in the petrochemical industries with about 150–200
trays and operate at reflux ratios of about 15.58 A PSA process can be an attractive alternative for C3H6/C3H8 separations because
of its expected low energy demand. A variety of adsorbents have been
investigated for this separation task.57,59−61 Promising good potential for alkene/alkane separations are MOFs
with coordinatively unsaturated metal centers that may be created
by evacuation of frameworks that have metal-bound solvent molecules.
This strategy has been employed to expose M2+ cation sites
in M2(dobdc) [M = Mg, Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, Fe; dobdc4– = 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate].62 Unsaturated alkynes and alkenes such as C2H2, C2H4, and C3H6 can
bind with M2+ of M2(dobdc), with side-on attachment
and π-coordination.5,63,64 The potential of M2(dobdc) for the technologically important
separations of C2H2/C2H4, C2H4/C2H6, and C3H6/C3H8 mixtures has been
established in laboratory studies.32,63−65 Other adsorbents that also exhibit adsorption selectivity in favor
of the unsaturated propene include CuBTC,66 LTA-4A zeolite,59,60 and NaX (=13X) zeolite.59,61 An important disadvantage of the C3H6/C3H8 separations with the adsorbents listed above
is that the desired alkene product, required for the production of
polymer-grade feedstock, can only be recovered in the desorption phase.
It becomes necessary to operate PSA units with multiple beds, involving
five different steps; the C3H6 product of desired
purity is recovered in the final step by counter-current vacuum blowdown.34,60,61,67

The recovery of high-purity C3H6 product
in the final vacuum blowdown step is expected to be enhanced if C3H8 is (almost) excluded from the pores during the
high-pressure adsorption cycle. Near-total exclusion of C3H8 is achievable by kinetically based separations using
cage-type zeolites with 8-ring windows.51 Due to the smaller cross section of the propene molecule (the dimensions
are provided by Chng et al.68), kinetic
separations selective to propene are possible using all-silica CHA
zeolite that consists of cages of volume 316 Å3 and
separated by 3.8 Å × 4.2 Å 8-ring windows.8,57,69−71

Using
the input data on isotherms and diffusivities provided by
Khalighi et al.,57 we first examine the
influence of thermodynamic coupling on transient uptake within a single
spherical crystallite of CHA zeolite, initially devoid of guest molecules,
exposed to a bulk 50:50 C3H6/C3H8 mixture at 100 kPa and T = 353 K. For the
uptake simulations using eq 7, the more mobile C3H6 exhibits a pronounced
overshoot in its approach to thermodynamic equilibrium (see Figure 6a).20,29 If thermodynamic coupling is ignored, no C3H6 overshoot is detected.

Figure 6 (a) Simulations of transient uptake of 50:50
C3H6(1)/C3H8(2) mixtures
within crystals
of all-silica CHA at 353 K. (b) Simulations of transient breakthrough
of 50:50 C3H6(1)/C3H8(2)
mixtures in a fixed-bed adsorber packed with crystals of all-silica
CHA at 353 K and operating at a total pressure of 100 kPa. The continuous
solid lines are simulations based on eq 7. The dashed lines are simulations based on eq 8. Further details and input
data are provided in Chapter 9 of the Supporting Information.

We should expect the
transient overshoot phenomena, and uphill
diffusion, to have a beneficial effect on the transient breakthrough
characteristics in fixed beds.29Figure 6b shows the simulations
for transient breakthrough of 50:50 C3H6/C3H8 mixtures in a fixed bed adsorber packed with
crystals of all-silica CHA at 353 K and operating at a total pressure
of 100 kPa. The simulations clearly show that more than 90% pure C3H8 can be collected during the earlier stages of
transience. If thermodynamic coupling effects are ignored and simplified eq 8 are invoked, the time
interval during which more than 90% pure C3H8 can be recovered is reduced by about an order of magnitude. Expressed
per kg of CHA zeolite in the packed bed, the respective productivities
of more than 90% pure C3H8 are 0.62 and 0.06
mol kg–1, a reduction by a factor of about 10 due
to neglect of thermodynamic coupling.

It must be remarked that
the model used by Khalighi et al.57 takes
due account of thermodynamic coupling
effects, whereas more simplified approach using the linear driving
force approximation is adopted by Da Silva and Rodrigues61 for modeling kinetic separations of C3H6/C3H8 mixtures using LTA-4A zeolite.

Cadiau et al.72 report the synthesis
of NbOFFIVE-1-Ni (also named KAUST-7), a customized MOF for C3H6/C3H8 separations that
belongs to the class of SIFSIX materials,73 using pyrazine as the organic linker. The (SiF6)2– pillars in the cage are replaced with somewhat bulkier
(NbOF5)2– pillars. This causes tilting
of the pyrazine molecule on the linker, effectively reducing the aperture
opening from 0.50 nm [with (SiF6)2– pillars]
to 0.30 nm. The small aperture permits ingress of the smaller C3H6 molecules but practically excludes C3H8 on the basis of subtle differences in bond lengths,
bond angles, and molecular conformations.5Figure 7 presents
a comparison of the percentage C3H8 in the outlet
gas leaving fixed-bed adsorbers packed with KAUST-7 and CHA zeolite.
Both of these adsorbents appear to be equally effective in near-total
exclusion of C3H8. Further investigation and
detailed PSA simulations such as that presented by Khalighi et al.67 are required to determine whether KAUST-7 offers
significant improvements over CHA zeolite for the production of more
than 99.5% pure C3H6. It is worth mentioning
that in Figure S12 of Cadiau et al.,72 breakthroughs of KAUST-7 are compared with data
on LTA-4A and LTA-5A zeolites but not with all-silica CHA.

3.5 Separation
of Mixtures of Hexane Isomers
An important step in the production
of high-octane gasoline is
the separation of hexane isomers, n-hexane (nC6), 2-methylpentane (2MP), 3-methylpentane (3MP), 2,2-dimethylbutane
(22DMB), and 2,3-dimethylbutane (23DMB). The values of the Research
Octane Number (RON) increases with the degree of branching: nC6 = 30, 2MP = 74.5, 3MP = 75.5, 22DMB = 94, and 23DMB
= 105. Due to their higher RON values, di-branched isomers are preferred
products for inclusion in the high-octane gasoline pool.18,74,75 There are a number of adsorbents
that have potential use in the separation of hexane isomers.18,76 Separations using MFI zeolite18 have
some unique characteristics; these features arise from the preferential
location of the mono- and di-branched isomers at the channel intersections,
whereas the linear nC6 can locate anywhere within
the channel network.6,77,78 As a consequence, the hierarchy of adsorption strengths, dictated
by configurational entropy considerations,6,79,80 is nC6 > 2MP ≈
3MP
> 22DMB ≈ 23DMB. The hierarchy of the magnitudes of intracrystalline
diffusivities is nC6 ≫ 2MP ≈ 3MP ≫
22DMB ≈ 23DMB.58 Consequently, both
adsorption and diffusion act synergistically.18,81

The transient uptake of nC6/2MP mixtures
in MFI crystals, exposed to an equimolar gas-phase mixture at constant
total pressure (=2.6 Pa) have been reported by Titze et al.29,81 (see Figure 8a).
The transient equilibration of nC6 displays a pronounced
overshoot, achieving supraequilibrium loadings during transient equilibration.
The origin of the nC6 overshoot is traceable to the
contribution of finite off-diagonal elements of Γij; if the assumption Γij = δij is invoked, the overshoot
disappears.

Figure 8 (a) Experimental data of Titze et al.81 for the transient uptake of nC6/2MP mixtures in
MFI zeolite at 298 K.29 (b) RON of product
gas mixture leaving fixed-bed adsorber packed with MFI operating at
a total pressure of 100 kPa and 433 K; the feed is a 5-component nC6/2MP/3MP/22DMB/23DMB mixture with partial pressure of
20 kPa for each component. The continuous solid lines are simulations
based on eq 7. The dashed
lines are simulations based on eq 8. Further details and input data are provided in Chapter
10 of the Supporting Information, which
also contains the rationale for ignoring correlation effects.

Uphill diffusion of nC6 is beneficial to the hexane
isomer separations in fixed beds because the desired raffinate phase
will be richer in the branched isomers that have high octane numbers.
To confirm this expectation, transient breakthrough simulations were
performed for a 5-component nC6/2MP/3MP/22DMB/23DMB
mixture. The transient variations of the RON values of the gas mixture
exiting the adsorber are plotted in Figure 8b.7,18,29 Assuming that the target RON value of the raffinate is 92+ RON,
we can determine the number of moles of 92+ RON product that can be
recovered during the initial transience. The 92+ RON productivity
is 0.36 mol kg–1 for the scenario in which thermodynamic
coupling is included. The 92+ RON productivity is lowered to a value
of 0.28 mol kg–1 for invoking the simplification
Γij = δij.

4 Conclusions
The
major conclusion that emerges from our investigation of kinetic
separations of five different mixtures is the need for proper modeling
of the intracrystalline diffusion, which takes proper account of thermodynamic
coupling influences.51 The off-diagonal
elements Γij (i ≠ j) engender overshoots in the loading
of the more mobile partner species during transient uptakes within
a microporous particle. Such overshoots, signifying uphill diffusion,
are beneficial, resulting in increasing productivity of the tardier
component that is recovered in purified form as raffinate during the
high-pressure adsorption cycle of PSA operations.

Although the
inclusion of thermodynamic coupling influences for
kinetic separations in adsorbers is properly recognized by Ruthven,
Farooq, and others,4,37,43,52,54,57,67 there are several other
published works that adopt much simpler approaches employing eq 8;28 the simulations presented in this article demonstrate that such
simplified approaches may lead to severely pessimistic estimates of
the effectiveness of kinetic separations.

Thermodynamic coupling
effects should also be expected to have
strong influences on the selectivity and conversion of diffusion-limited
zeolite-catalyzed reactions carried in fixed-bed reactors;78 this aspect deserves further investigation.
