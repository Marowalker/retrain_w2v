A novel
hyperbranched ester plasticizer (SOHE) was synthesized
from soybean oil. FTIR, 1H NMR, and 13C NMR
spectroscopies were used to analyze the chemical structure of SOHE.
SOHE was added into poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC). Thermal, mechanical,
and dynamic mechanical properties of PVC samples were studied with
thermal gravimetric analysis, dynamic mechanical analysis, and tensile
tests. The results of SOHE substitution of petroleum-based dioctyl
phthalate (DOP) in soft PVC samples were studied. The results indicated
that PVC blends mixed with the obtained plasticizer showed higher
thermal stability and flexibility. When DOP was completely replaced
with SOHE, the Ti, T10, and T50 of the films were raised
to 267.5, 275.3, and 338.0 °C, respectively. The plasticizing
mechanism was also investigated. The volatility resistance and extraction
were studied, which results indicated that the migration stability
of PVC samples was significantly enhanced with the increasing amount
of SOHE.

==== Body
1 Introduction
To obtain the desired
flexible PVC products, more than 80% plasticizers
are used in PVC processing as additives, which could be applied to
medical devices, pipes, coatings, films, and so on.1−4 The commercial plasticizer DOP
is the usual main plasticizer, which is limited by the law due to
its high risk of biological effects and toxicity on humans.5 Furthermore, because of easy diffusion to surroundings
from PVC resin, phthalates have an environmental impact, which also
reduce the durable performance of PVC products.3,6−8 In addition, research on environmentally friendly
alternative plasticizers has been triggered by environmental concerns.9−12

Soybean oil is a renewable low-cost and commonly used agricultural
resource. From it, we can derive epoxidized soybean oil (ESO), polyesters,
and modified polyurethane, which can be widely used in industries.
It is reported that ESO is generally used as a reactive modifier,
diluent, and plasticizer or stabilizer for PVC.13−15 However, ESO
presents poor migration stability for use in large doses, which is
usually used in lower amounts as a secondary plasticizer.

Highly
branched esters have improved plasticizer migration compared
to DOP, which also have lower toxicity.16 Kwak et al. developed bio-based alkyl terminal hyperbranched polyglycerols
and highly branched polycaprolactone/glycidol copolymeric plasticizers.16,17 The prepared PVC films showed excellent flexibility and solvent
extraction resistance, showing potential in replacing DOP.16 Hai et al. did work on synthesis of castor oil-based
hyperbranched esters,18 which have improved
plasticizing effects, volatility resistance, and solvent extraction
resistance. However, there are unreacted double bonds in the obtained
hyperbranched ester plasticizer, which might reduce the compatibility
of plasticizers and PVC.16,17

We provided a
novel soybean oil-based plasticizer, a hyperbranched
ester plasticizer (SOHE), in this work (Figure 1). This plasticizer was blended into PVC
as the main plasticizer or a secondary plasticizer for DOP. A wide
range of PVC sample properties, such as thermal properties, dynamic
mechanical properties, mechanical properties before and after aging,
and migration properties, was investigated. According to our study,
SOHE could prove to be a promising candidate for an alternative renewable
plasticizer.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization
In Figure 2, the chemical
structure of
SOHE was analyzed with FTIR and compared with SOL and SOH. In the
spectrum of SOL, the peak at 3442 cm–1 corresponded
to an absorption peak of O–H. The strong absorption at 1737
cm–1 was attributed to a carbonyl group. Furthermore,
the absorption peak at 3456 cm–1 in the curve of
SOH appears to be stronger than that of SOL, which indicated that
more O–H groups appeared in SOH. For SOHE, the characteristic
absorption peak around 3456 cm–1 had disappeared.
The peaks of carbonyl groups at 1742 cm–1 appeared
to be stronger than those of SOH and SOL. These illustrated that the
ester groups were obtained. The results implied that the soybean oil-based
polyol SOH had been converted into ester by esterification, and the
hyperbranched ester was prepared.

Figure 2 FTIR spectra of SOL, SOH, and SOHE.

Figure 3 shows the 1H NMR spectra of SOL, SOH, and SOHE.
As seen from Figure 3a, the peak at 0.89
ppm (peak 1) was assigned to protons of methyl groups. The peak at
1.32 ppm (peak 2) and peaks at around 1.40–3.00 ppm (peaks
8, 5, and 9) corresponded to protons of methylene. The peaks at 3.00–4.50
ppm (peaks 10, 6, 7, 3, 4, and 12) corresponded to the protons of
methylene groups of glyceride with the methyne connected to hydroxyl
groups and methoxy groups. In Figure 3b, the peaks at 2.08–4.21 ppm (peaks 3, 3′,
and 3″) corresponding to the protons of the methylene and methyne
linked with hydroxyl were stronger than those of SOL, which indicated
that the polyol was produced. Figure 3c shows the 1H NMR of SOHE. The chemical
shift at 2.04 ppm (peak 1′) was attributed to protons of methyl
groups linked with carbonyl groups. The new peak at 5.26 ppm (peak
11′) corresponded to the protons of methyne groups connected
to carbonyl. These results suggested that the hyperbranched ester
was prepared.

SOHE.

2.2 Thermal
Stability
Figure 4 displays the TGA spectrum
of SOHE and DOP heated in nitrogen at the rate of 10 °C/min.
In Table 2, the initial
decomposition temperature (Ti), 10% and
50% mass loss temperatures (T10 and T50), and weight loss are summarized. It can
be seen that SOHE had increases of 137.3, 104.8, and 129.6 °C
compared with DOP in Ti, T10, and T50, respectively.
It can be summarized that the plasticizer SOHE shows better thermal
stability.

Figure 4 TGA curves of SOHE and DOP.

Figure 5 shows the
results of PVC samples with different contents of SOHE. The degradation
data of Ti, T10, and T50 and weight loss data at different
times are summarized in Table 1. There are two main degradation steps in the degradation
curve of PVC samples.19,20 It can be seen in the first stage
that the largest weight loss of 69.7% is at 200–350 °C.
Furthermore, the second step has the largest weight loss of 21.6%
at 400–500 °C. The Ti, T10, and T50 of the
PVC sample plasticized with DOP (F1) were 226.0, 239.2, and 291.7
°C. The Ti, T10, and T50 were enhanced when
DOP was replaced with SOHE, and the Ti, T10, and T50 reached 263.3, 266.8, and 314.3 °C, respectively, when 75%
DOP was substituted with SOHE. The Ti, T10, and T50 reached
275.4, 281.8, and 321.8 °C when DOP was fully replaced with SOHE.
It can be observed that the thermal stability of PVC samples was increased
when the content 0f SOHE increased. The reason can be explained with
the fact that the carbonyl groups and long alkane chains with high
heat resistance are contained in the chemical structure of SOHE. The
results show that the addition of SOHE can more effectively improve
the thermal stability of the PVC matrix than DOP.

samples with different plasticizers.

2.3 Dynamic Mechanical Analysis
A DMA
instrument was used to evaluate the dynamic mechanical property. Figure 6 shows the loss factor
of the PVC samples. All the curves show a single peak of tan δ,
which indicate that the blends are completely intersoluble and homogeneous
materials.21 The glass transition temperature
(Tg) is the temperature at the maximum
of the tan δ curve, which is an important metric of plasticizing
efficiency. As shown in Table 1, the Tg values for F1–F5
are 41.46, 45.68, 46.82, 51.57, and 61.89 °C, respectively. However,
the Tg of plasticized PVC samples was
much less than the value of 92.3 °C for pure PVC. When 25% and
50% DOP was replaced with SOHE, the Tg was slightly higher than that of pure DOP. With the addition of
SOHE, tan δ peaks moved to higher temperatures, and the corresponding Tg values increased.22 This might be due to the chemical structure of SOHE.23,24 Compared with DOP, SOHE has the higher molecular weight, which makes
the plasticizing effect reduced when DOP is substituted with SOHE.
However, the damping capability increased with the addition of SOHE,
leading to taller and narrower peaks than those of sample F1. In addition,
the plasticizing mechanism can be explained according to the molecular
features of PVC and plasticizers. As indicated in Figure 7, the ester polar groups of
SOHE interact with the α hydrogen of PVC chains to form hydrogen
bonds, which decreased the interaction of PVC–PVC sites and
increased the space between polymer molecules. Furthermore, more free
volume in the polymer will be created by the motion of long alkyl
chains of SOHE. The interaction promoted the random motion of PVC
to make plasticized PVC chains easy to proceed and show flexibility.

interaction between SOHE and PVC molecules.

2.4 Mechanical Properties
The results
of tensile strength and elongation at break of PVC samples before
and after heat aging are demonstrated in Figure 8. Compared with F1, PVC plasticized with
SOHE (films F2 and F3) had an increased elongation at break and lower
tensile strength. Because more dendritic structures with ester carbonyl
polar groups and flexible long alkane chains present synergistic plasticizing
effects on PVC, SOHE had a remarkable effect on the flexibility when
partly replacing DOP.25,26 However, the elongation at break
decreased and the tensile strength increased when the concentration
of SOHE increased to 75 and 100%, respectively. This is mainly because
of the high molecular weight of SOHE. These results suggest that SOHE
can be used as a secondary plasticizer, endowing the PVC matrix with
better flexibility. On the other hand, sample F0 showed the max change
of mechanical properties after heat aging. The PVC films plasticized
with SOHE as a partial or whole replacement plasticizer for DOP (films
F2–F5) did not show much difference in the mechanical properties
after aging. The above results suggested that SOHE could improve the
thermal stabilities and flexibility of PVC materials.

Figure 8 Mechanical properties
of the PVC samples before and after heat
aging.

2.5 Extraction
and Volatility Resistance
To increase the safety and extend
the service life of PVC samples,
the volatile resistance and solvent extraction resistance of the plasticizer
should be raised. In this work, the extraction resistance of SOHE
in petroleum ether and volatility were investigated.

As displayed
in Figure 9, the weight
loss of F2–F5 ranged from 6.3 to 7.9% of their initial weight.
The weight loss of F1 is 11.8% of its initial weight loss. This result
suggested that SOHE is superior to DOP in solvent extraction resistance.
The change of weight loss of PVC samples in the volatilization test
is similar to that of the extraction test. The weight loss of F3 was
lower than 1.1% in the experiment of volatilization. However, F1 lost
approximately 2.0% of its initial weight. It can be seen that SOHE
has excellent heat resistance, which makes it more stable than DOP
in volatilization experiments. The excellent solvent extraction resistance
and volatile resistance of SOHE can be attributed to the high branching
degree, large relative molecular mass, and high ester content of SOHE.
Compared with DOP, the stronger intermolecular interaction force prevents
SOHE migration from PVC blends. It can endow PVC products with long-term
stability and safety.

experiments.

3 Conclusions
SOHE was synthesized, and we evaluated its effects on mechanical
properties, thermal stabilities, and migration stabilities of PVC
samples. When SOHE partially or completely substituted commercial
plasticizer DOP in soft PVC samples, the effects were investigated.
The DMA results suggested that, with the increasing amount of SOHE,
the compatibility between the plasticizers and PVC enhanced. TGA was
used to examine the thermal stability. The TGA results suggested that
SOHE could endow PVC samples with increased thermal stability. When
SOHE completely substituted DOP, Ti, T10, and T50 increased
to 267.5, 275.3, and 338.0 °C, respectively. The tensile results
suggested that SOHE had an enhanced plasticizing effect compared with
that of DOP. In addition, PVC samples had better migration stability
with the substitution of SOHE into DOP. Consequently, this soybean
oil-based plasticizer has the potential to be a secondary environmental
plastic material.

4.6 Characterizations
1H NMR
spectra in deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) were recorded
on a Bruker ARX 300 spectrometer (Bruker Co., Germany) at 23 °C.
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was carried out by
an attenuated total reflectance method using a Nicolet IS10 spectrometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., U.S.A.). Dynamic mechanical analysis
(DMA) was done in a dual cantilever mode with a frequency of 1 Hz
by a DMA Q800 instrument (TA Instruments, New Castle, DE). The heating
rate was of 3 °C/min. The testing temperature was swept from
−60 to 80 °C. Replicated tests were performed for each
specimen to ensure the reproducibility of data. Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) was conducted in a 409PC thermogravimetric analyzer
(Netzsch Co., Germany). Each specimen was scanned from 30 to 600 °C
under a nitrogen atmosphere. The heating rate was 10 °C/min.
According to ISO 527-2:1993, tensile properties were carried out by
a SANS CMT-4303 universal testing machine (Shenzhen Xinsansi Jiliang
Instrument Co., China) with a cross-head speed at 10 mm/min. To obtain
an average value, five specimens were prepared for each group. Prior
to tensile testing, all specimens were conditioned at 23 °C for
one day. According to ASTMD 1239-98, the extraction tests were carried
out. The PVC specimens were sank into petroleum ether at 50 ±
5% relative humidity and 23 ± 1 °C. The extracted specimens
were rinsed using flowing water and wiped up after 24 h. Then, the
specimens were dried at 30 °C for 24 h in a convection oven (Shanghai
Suopu Instrument Co., China). The changes of weight loss before and
after sinking were measured. To obtain an average value, three specimens
were tested. The activated carbon method (ISO 176:2005) was carried
out to determine the volatility. The specimens were placed on the
bottom of a metal container. Approximately 120 cm3 of activated
carbon was spread over these specimens. The container was placed in
the convection oven (Shanghai Suopu Instrument Co., China) for 24
h at a temperature of 70 ± 1 °C. The container was removed
and cooled in a desiccator. The specimens were reweighed. The changes
of weight loss were measured.
