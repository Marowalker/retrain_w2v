We
describe a new 1-[Bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridinium 3-oxide hexafluorophosphate
(HATU)-mediated coupling reaction to produce 2-imino benzo[e]-1,3-oxazin-4-ones from salicylic acids and anilines.
Mechanistic studies support a reaction pathway in which HATU mediates
carbon transfer to the initially formed salicylanilides to form in
succession reactive tetramethylisouronium and N-acyl(dimethyl)isouronium
intermediates, which then undergo imine–iminium exchange to
generate the desired oxazinones.

==== Body
Introduction
Formation of amides
through the use of coupling reagents is one
of the most valuable methods in medicinal chemistry. Some of the most
widely used coupling reagents are carbodiimides, phosphonium, and
immonium salts. 1-[Bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridinium 3-oxide hexafluorophosphate
(HATU), a commonly used immonium salt, is a powerful coupling reagent
because of its high efficiency and fast reaction rate.1−3 We envisioned that salicylanilide 3a (Scheme 1) could be generated via HATU-mediated
coupling of salicylic acid (1a) and aniline (2a). When the reaction (Scheme 1) failed to produce 3a in a satisfactory yield
(15%), we discovered that the major product was the unexpected 2-imino
benzo[e]-1,3-oxazin-4-one 4a (39%).
In view of this intriguing reaction course and the widespread use
of HATU in the synthesis of amides and peptides, we investigated the
mechanism by which HATU mediates a carbon transfer to 3a to give the cyclic product 4a.

Scheme 1 Initially Observed
Reaction
Results and Discussion
First, we attempted to identify all of the reaction intermediates
and products by running the reaction with 4-bromoaniline (2b) in place of 2a as we envisioned that the presence
of the bromine atom could facilitate product detection by gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (GC–MS) and NMR. As can be seen in Scheme 2, the major product was dibromo
2-imino benzo[e]-1,3-oxazin-4-one 4b (40%), along with guanidinium salt 5, salicylurea 6, and benzo[e][1,3]oxazine-2,4(3H)-dione 7. The formation of 7 led us to formulate a reaction pathway from 3a to 4a that would involve multiple isouronium intermediates (vide
infra).

Scheme 2 Reaction of 1a and 2b with HATU
Clearly, the observed distribution
of reaction products suggests
that HATU-mediated coupling is not well-suited for the synthesis of
salicylanilides. To assess if 3a was a precursor of 4a, we conducted a reaction using 3a as the starting
material, 1 equiv of 2a, and 1.5 equiv of HATU. As anticipated, 4a was produced in a 35% yield; thus, it appears that amide
formation is likely the initial step in this transformation. However,
substituting 2b for 2a in the same reaction
produced a 1:1 ratio of monobromo 2-imino benzo[e]-1,3-oxazin-4-one regioisomers 4c (expected) and 4d (unexpected) in a combined yield of 38% (Scheme 3, reaction 1). 1D and 2D NMR
data verified the structures of each isomer (see Supporting Information for details). When we ran the same
reaction using N-(4-bromophenyl)-2-hydroxybenzamide
(3b) and 2a (Scheme 3, reaction 2) as a complementary set of starting
materials, we obtained the unexpected 4a in 29% yield
and only trace amounts of 4c and 4d.

Scheme 3 Formation of 2-Imino Benzo[e]-1,3-oxazin-4-ones
via Transamidation
Yield determined by GC–MS.

Although the formation of unexpected product 4d added
complexity to this reaction, it led us to propose a three-step mechanism
(Scheme 4) to account
for the conversion of salicylanilides 3 to 2-imino benzo[e]-1,3-oxazin-4-ones 4: (1) guanidinium exchange
with HATU to form the linchpin 1,1,3,3-tetramethyl-2-phenylisouronium
intermediate A and HOAt; (2) cyclization of tetramethylisouronium
intermediates A and B (formed from A by transamidation) to form a pair of N-acyl(dimethyl)isouronium
benzo[e]-1,3-oxazin-4-ones C; and (3)
imine–iminium exchange to generate 2-imino benzo[e]-1,3-oxazin-4-ones 4. This mechanism also accounts
for the formation of reaction products 6 and 7 (Scheme 2) as a result
of two modes of hydrolysis of intermediates C.

Scheme 4 Proposed
Mechanism for the Formation of Benzo[e]-1,3-oxazin-4-ones
from Reactions of Salicylic Acids and Anilines with HATU
Formation of the unexpected
product 4a (Scheme 3, reaction 2) can be explained
by a transamidation process where the more nucleophilic 2a can displace the less nucleophilic 2b to form the more
stable intermediate C. Importantly, the more reactive
aniline would also speed up the imine–iminium exchange in step
3. For the reaction described in Scheme 3, reaction 1, the 1,1,3,3-tetramethyl-2-phenylisouronium
intermediates A and B are apparently formed
in a balanced ratio.

We next asked the question whether alkylamines
would undergo a
similar transformation to form the corresponding 2-imino benzo[e]-1,3-oxazin-4-ones as they are more nucleophilic than
anilines and would consequently be expected to facilitate salicylamide
formation and step 3 to a greater extent. Thus, similar reactions
were conducted with cyclohexylamine (2c) and benzylamine
(2d) using the same conditions as those in Scheme 1.

To our surprise, in
the reaction between 1a and 2d, the corresponding
dibenzyl benzo[e]-1,3-oxazin-4-one
was not observed by GC–MS and NMR. Consistent with the existing
data,4 the major product (45% yield) was
the benzyl guanidinium hexafluorophosphate salt in addition to trace
amounts of N-benzyl salicylamide (3d). However, reaction between 1a and 2c produced
the desired benzo[e]-1,3-oxazin-4-one 4e in 10% yield accompanied by N-cyclohexylsalicylamide
(3c) detected by GC–MS (Scheme 5). It appears that alkylamines are poor substrates
for this type of transformation as they appear to form more stable
guanidinium salts.

Scheme 5 Reaction with Cyclohexylamine
Yield determined by GC–MS.

To further probe our proposed reaction mechanism,
we conducted
two HATU reactions with a complementary set of starting materials: 3d with 2b and 3b with 2d (Scheme 6, reactions
1 and 2). For both the reactions, 2-imino benzo[e]-1,3-oxazin-4-one 4f was the major product formed,
implying that cyclization in step 2 can still occur with the more
stable N-alkyl salicylamides. The reaction outcome
also indicates that 2d does not undergo the iminium–imine
exchange (Scheme 4,
step 3). We suggest that arylamines are favored over alkylamines in
the last step because of the conjugative stabilization provided by
the aryl system. 1D and 2D NMR data for 4f (see Supporting Information for details) are consistent
with the structure of the major product. The heteronuclear multiple
bond correlation (HMBC) of the C-18 hydrogen atoms with the C-2, C-4,
and N-3 atoms provided key structural assignments.

on Product Formation

The structure of 4f was also unambiguously
confirmed
via single crystal X-ray analysis (Figure 1).

X-ray diffraction (displacement ellipsoids given at 50% probability

We were able to find only a single
study4 with a slightly similar mechanism:
the synthesis of 3-substituted-4(3H)-quinazolinones
via HATU-mediated coupling of 4-hydroxyquinazolines
with amines. In this reaction, HATU functions as a guanidine-forming
agent, whereas in our new reaction, HATU serves as a carbon transfer
reagent. To support their proposed reaction mechanism, the authors4 isolated reaction intermediate 8 (Scheme 7). Out of
curiosity, we resynthesized 8 and obtained the same 1H and 13C NMR spectra. However, we suggest that
1D, 2D (COSY, HMBC HSQC), and 19F NMR data (Supporting Information), most notably, key signals
at 12.19 (s, NH-1) and 7.78 (d, J = 12.7 Hz, CH-17),
are more consistent with the structure of the hexafluorophosphate
salt of its regioisomer 10. We propose a Dimroth-type
attack of cyclohexylamine on an initially formed N-acylguanidinium intermediate 9 to form 10, which then undergoes intramolecular transamidation to form 11 (Scheme 7).

Scheme 7 Dimroth-Type Mechanism for Intermediate 10
In view of this new HATU carbon
transfer reaction to form the relatively
unexplored 2-imino benzo[e]-1,3-oxazin-4-one class
of heterocycles, we then sought to optimize the reaction conditions.
We first surveyed two other coupling reagents using the original reaction
conditions: 1a (1 equiv), 2a (2 equiv),
triethylamine (TEA, 2.1 equiv), coupling reagent (2.5 equiv), CH3CN, rt, 24 h. Dichloromethylene-dimethyliminium chloride produced
a large quantity of byproducts and a low yield of 4a (8%).
In contrast, 1-[(dimethylamino) (morpholino)methylene]-1H-[1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-b]pyridine-1-ium 3-oxide hexafluorophosphate
afforded a yield of 4a (40%), similar to that of HATU
(39%). We decided to use HATU for the remaining optimization experiments
because it is less expensive and more widely available.

A brief
study of the effect of solvents and bases is shown in Table 1. At room temperature
in dimethylacetamide (DMA), a slightly lower yield was obtained compared
to the same reaction in CH3CN. When using CH2Cl2 (entry 2), reflux temperatures were required to completely
dissolve all of the starting materials but the yield was no better
than using CH3CN at rt. Indeed, the reaction yield decreased
in refluxing CH3CN (entry 5). The reaction was relatively
insensitive to the solvent as long as the starting materials were
soluble. Yields were lower with pyridine (entry 7) compared to aliphatic
weak bases such as TEA, 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU),
and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA)
(entries 1–3). On the basis of these data, CH3CN,
rt, and TEA, DBU, or DIPEA appear to be the optimal combination of
solvent, temperature, and base. Because stopping the reaction after
1 h lowered the yield to 12%, we opted to continue to use a 24 h reaction
time. It is important to note that the addition of base is required
for the transformation to proceed (entry 8). Increasing the equiv
of 2a from the stoichiometric 2 to 6 had no significant
effect on the yield of cyclized product 4a (40%).

Using these optimized
conditions, we began to explore the scope
and limitations of this transformation by studying the reaction between
various anilines 1 and salicylic acids 2 to form oxazinones 4, the results of which are presented
in Table 2. Reactions
proceeded in moderate yields for a range of salicylic acids and anilines
(entries 1, 2, and 5–8) and failed only for reactions with
anilines bearing strong electron-withdrawing groups (entries 3 and
4). Interestingly, the reaction of 5-chlorosalicylic acid 1b with 2a and HATU gave the highest yield (65%), possibly
because of the activation of phenol by the chloro group. Surprisingly,
the reaction to form 4o failed in CH3CN but
proceeded reasonably well (40% yield) when it was run in DMA. As shown
earlier, 4a and 4b were obtained in 39 and
40% yields using the same conditions. Some reaction yields that otherwise
might have been higher were significantly diminished because of difficult
chromatographic purification.

Few reports describe the synthesis of 2-imino benzo[e]-1,3-oxazin-4-ones. For example, Larksarp and Alper5 synthesized 2-imino benzo[e]-1,3-oxazin-4-ones
in good to excellent yields via cyclocarbonylation of o-iodophenols with carbodiimides in the presence of 1,4-bis(diphenylphosphino)butane
(dppb), Pd, and pressurized carbon monoxide. Ziegler et al.8 also described a method to synthesize 2-imino
benzo[e]-1,3-oxazin-4-ones using 2-hydroxybenzoyl
chloride. Although our new reaction gives low to moderate yields of
benzo[e]-1,3-oxazin-4-ones, it enables fast access
to these compounds under mild conditions.

Conclusions
In
summary, we discovered a new reaction to obtain 2-imino benzo[e]-1,3-oxazin-4-ones from salicylic acids, anilines, and
HATU. On the other hand, this work reveals potential drawbacks in
using HATU or similar immonium-type coupling reagents in the synthesis
of amides from salicylic acids because of the production of 2-imino
benzo[e]-1,3-oxazin-4-ones and other byproducts.
The carbon transfer reaction mechanism appears to occur through successive
formation of reactive tetramethylisouronium and N-acyl(dimethyl)isouronium reaction intermediates, which then undergo
imine–iminium exchange to generate the oxazinone reaction products.
While the reaction yields are not ideal, the combination of mild reaction
conditions, flexible substitution patterns, and commercial availability
of reagents may make this protocol a practical route to 2-imino benzo[e]-1,3-oxazin-4-ones.
