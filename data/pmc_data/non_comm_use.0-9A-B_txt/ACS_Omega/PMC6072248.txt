Amyloid oligomers
have emerged as a key neurotoxin in Alzheimer’s
dementia. Amyloid aggregation inhibitors and modulators have therefore
offered potential applications in therapeutics and diagnosis. However,
crossing the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and finding the toxic
aggregates among aggregates of different sizes and shapes remain a
challenge. The ability of identifying early aggregates can provide
a new approach to find inhibitors of the initial nucleation events
correlating presenile dementia. In this study, we have prepared polyfluorene
nanoparticles using chitosan as an additive, which enables it to cross
BBB efficiently and employed as a highly efficient amyloid oligomer
modulator. The polymer conjugate, polyfluorene–chitosan (PC),
shows no toxicity in MTT assay and precludes self-aggregation of Aβ1–40
and human cerebrospinal fluid oligomers to final fibril formation.
This modulation strategy is supported by thioflavin T assay, circular
dichroism studies, atomic force microscope images, and Fourier transform
infrared analysis. The polymer–protein interface exhibits the
presence of co-aggregates and responded with a stable optical response.
The simple synthesis to get desired sizes and shapes with necessary
photophysical behavior, biocompatibility, and most prominently BBB
permeability makes this polymer conjugate very unique and highly attractive
for modulation of amyloid oligomers selectively as well as for developing
next generation nanotheranostic materials toward presenile dementia.

Introduction
Inhibition of amyloid
aggregation has emerged as one of the most
crucial strategy against protein misfolding diseases. A recently developed
therapy for Alzheimer’s disease, aducanumab (BIIB037), significantly
lowered the amyloid burden in patients and worked like a homing device.1 However, the search for structures to trap intermediates
of nucleation-dependent amyloid polymerization still remains complex
and challenging. Several lines of evidence indicate that Aβ
may have a role in controlling synaptic activity and in the normal
function of the nervous system.2−5 Therefore, Aβ should not be considered as a
mere toxic factor that needs to be eliminated to avoid the progression
of the disease. It evokes neurotoxic effects during aggregation with
a change in structure, shape, and size to produce senile plaques.6−12 Soluble oligomers initiate disease-specific cytopathology and following
symptoms whereas plaques are relatively inert but serve as pools of
diffusible oligomers through dissociation.12−18 Therefore, identifying the small intermediates and targeting these
soluble oligomers selectively may shed light on presenile dementia
and therapeutic intervention. Designing efficient drugs for targeting
these early aggregates/oligomers across the blood–brain barrier
(BBB) makes the scenario even more complex because of the lesser surface
area interaction of the higher order heterogenic aggregates and crossing
the barrier efficiently.19 The BBB is embraced
by endothelial cells “glued” together to form junctions,
and major percentage of the brain homeostasis is controlled by the
entry and exit at the BBB via them. This barrier has the ability to
prevent and effectively expel undesirable materials from the brain
and at the same time accomplish the job of providing essential supplements,
signaling molecules and the vital immune cells in the brain.20−22 To tackle this dual challenge, we have designed a polyfluorene derivative
to modulate early Aβ aggregates. This report details a conjugated
polymer–biopolymer platform “polyfluorene–chitosan”
(PC), a polyfluorene derivative (PFDPA) and chitosan (a polysaccharide)
nanocomposite which can easily cross endothelial monolayers (shown
as a BBB mimic) unlike its precursor polyfluorene as well as modulate
amyloid aggregates very efficiently. Polymerization of amyloid oligomers
to final fibrils in real cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples as well
as in commercial Aβ1–40 was examined both in the presence
and absence of modulators after different time intervals by monitoring
thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescent response. Secondary structure information
of Aβ proteins both in the presence and absence of modulators
was gathered using circular dichroism (CD) and Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) studies. Morphological updates in the presence of modulators
were collected using atomic force microscopy (AFM) images. As an additional
feature, this polymeric conjugate also showed a distinct optical response
in the presence of Aβ1–40 oligomers because of the preferred
surface motif and further hydrophobic interaction with the hydrophobic
core of the peptide that resulted in inhibition to final fibril formation.
These unique observations are elaborately explained, which confirm
the unique abilities of the polyfluorene nanoparticles–chitosan
composites.

Results
Alzheimer’s disease is pathologically
linked to Aβ
aggregation which has no physiological roles. Efforts to find efficient
structural variants in either modulating these robust amyloid structures
or inhibiting the aggregation process of these endogenous peptides
led to the development of polymeric nanoparticles, which may lead
to future theranostic precursors.23 PFDPA
was found to be a near perfect modulator for amyloid β (Aβ1–40)
because of its hydrophobic nature; however, it failed to cross the
BBB (endothelial monolayer). To overcome this, water-dispersible nanoparticles
using chitosan and PFDPA were prepared (discussed in the Experimental Procedures section, Figure 1). In vitro toxicity and BBB
permeability of this polymeric conjugate (PC)
was confirmed prior to its use for modulation of Aβ and discussed
in detail.

(scale bar is 2 μm) and (b) PC (scale bar is 200 nm).

In Vitro Toxicity and BBB Permeability
Prior to the
in vitro BBB assay, both the polymeric conjugate (PC) and their precursors
(PFBr and PFDPA) toxicity were studied by MTT cell survival assay
with red blood cells (RBCs) and Ea hy926.1, respectively (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Cytotoxicity of PC2,
PC3, PFBr, and PFDPA (0–100 μg/mL)
in (a) human red blood cells and (b) endothelial cells (EA.hy926).
Error bars correspond to standard deviations of six sets of experiments.

Two different conjugates were
prepared, namely PC2 and PC3, using
both low as well as higher molecular weight chitosan along with PFDPA
to assess toxicity and permeability of the conjugates.

In hemolysis
assay, PFDPA and PFBr showed mild toxicity (∼4–5%)
to the RBC at ∼100 μg/mL concentration (Figure 2a). The lower concentration
was not toxic to the RBCs, whereas both the PC2 and PC3 showed lesser
than 2% toxicity at the maximum concentration (100 μg/mL) (Figure 2a). In MTT cell survival
assay, polymer compounds of PC2 were less than 10% toxic, whereas
others were 10–30% toxic at the maximum concentration (Figure 2b). However, at 50
μg/mL and lower concentration, they did not show significant
toxicity to the endothelial cells. On the basis of the toxicity assay
results, 50 μg/mL concentration was used to test the in vitro
BBB permeability assay (Figure 3).

(e) PFBr during the experiment. Movement of (b) PC2, (d) PC3, and
(f) PFBr through the endothelial monolayer from 0 to 4 h. Evans blue
was used for control studies and the error bars correspond to the
standard deviation of five experimental sets. The data points were
fitted with Microsoft Excel second order polynomial for PC2 and PC3,
whereas in PFBr, it is of third order.

The permeability efficiency of the test compounds were assessed
as mentioned in the Experimental Procedures section. The endothelial monolayer permeability assay results were
46.9 ± 0.1, 18.1 ± 3.8, and 0.2 ± 0.7% movement across
the barrier corresponding to PC2, PC3, and PFBr at the first hour
(Figure 3b,d,f). The
PFDPA concentration could not be calculated by the fluorescence method
as it was sparingly soluble in culture media and gave erroneous results.
Permeability efficiency data of PC2, PC3, and PFBr are tabulated in
the below table. Cellular integrity in the presence of polymer conjugates
were checked and remained intact throughout the experiment (Figure 3a,c,e). From the
BBB secretion studies, we confirmed that polymeric conjugate (PC)
was able to pass through the monolayer in a much easier manner compared
to polyfluorene precursors, that is, PFBr and PFDPA. Conjugates made
up of low molecular weight chitosan,
PC2, were able to cross BBB more efficiently than PC3 and further
utilized as a modulator (denoted as PC) in the present study (Table 1).

Modulatory Studies Using
ThT Assay
ThT assay was prepared
to examine the modulatory properties of the polymeric conjugate (PC)
both in the presence of commercial Aβ1–40 as well as
human CSF sample. The effects of other precursors used in making the
polymeric conjugate on amyloid fibrillation (Figure 4) were also checked. First, 100 μM
Aβ1–40 were incubated with 10 μg/mL PC in 10 mM
phosphate buffer saline (PBS) at 37 °C and used as a stock solution.
To check the effects on amyloid fibrillation, the samples were collected
from the above stock solution at different time intervals starting
from 0 to 84 h and diluted in 5 mM PBS. ThT (40 μM) was added
to each well of the microplate reader before recording ThT emission
at 482 nm using a microplate reader. Aβ1–40 (100 μM)
was treated with trifluoroacetyl (TFA) and hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP)
to disaggregate as discussed in the Experimental
Procedures section before incubating at 37 °C and used
as a control. ThT assay of Aβ1–40 control showed a lag
phase up to 50 h (Figure 4a,b, squares) before an increment in ThT fluorescence intensity
because of the formation of the fibrillar network. This increase in
intensity was not observed in the presence of PC (1 μg/mL, Figure 4a, circles) and the
same was detected in CSF sample also (15 μM, Figure 4a, diamonds). The decrease
in ThT fluorescence intensity suggested that the polymeric conjugate,
PC, inhibited the formation of amyloid fibril and it was also able
to disturb amyloid aggregation even in real CSF sample. Further, we
have incubated PC with preformed Aβ1–40 fibrils to check
the effects on already formed fibrillar networks. An initial high
fluorescence intensity at t0 was decreased
sharply and reached a plateau after 20 h of incubation (Figure 4a, triangles). To figure out
the effects of other precursors which were used to prepare PC, 100
μM Aβ1–40 were incubated with 10 μg/mL PFDPA,
PFBr, and chitosan (low molecular weight) separately in 10 mM PBS
at 37 °C. PFDPA and PFBr stock solutions were prepared initially
in THF and vigorously added into the water with continuous shaking,
and the final pellet was collected after centrifugation. These pellets
were used further as inhibitors and incubated with Aβ. Chitosan
was dissolved in dilute acetic acid solution and diluted from this
acidic solution to a final solution of 10 μg/mL in 10 mM PBS
at pH 7.4. ThT fluorescence maintained almost a straight line profile
in the presence of all the polymers unlike control (Figure 4b), suggesting a successful
inhibition of amyloid aggregation. ThT profile also showed that in
the presence of PC amyloid aggregation was nearly similar as in the
case of control till the growth phase is reached. ThT intensity started
decreasing after 60 h and followed a different path unlike control
(Figure 4a, squares
and circles). This divulged that unlike other precursors, PC was able
to disturb selectively the more neurotoxic amyloid oligomers or other
aggregation intermediates which existed in the growth phase and directed
the amyloid aggregation in a different pathway.

(20 μM, squares) and
(a) PC (1 μg/mL) with coincubated Aβ oligomers (circles),
Aβ fibrils (triangles), and CSF oligomers (15 μM, diamonds);

half-filled diamonds), and chitosan (low molecular weight, 1 μg/mL,

in 5 mM PBS (pH 7.4).

Changes in the Secondary Structure
To investigate the
changes in the peptide secondary structure in the presence of PC,
the CD spectrum of only Aβ1–40, CSF (controls) as well
as coincubated with polymeric conjugate were recorded at different
time intervals.

All the samples were incubated at 37 °C
in 10 mM PBS and diluted in 1 mM PBS before recording CD spectra.
The spectra of only Aβ showed negative minimum (around 200 nm)
upon 24 h incubation, confirming the formation of ordered β-sheet
aggregation from the initial random coil. Small positive maxima at
191–193 nm and a negative minimum were observed in the control
(Figure 5a, black line)
Aβ1–40 solution. Aβ1–40 oligomers showed
no such negative peak in the presence of PC. After 84 h incubation,
the negative hump was reversed and a new positive maximum (around
196 nm) was observed (Figure 5a, red line).

Figure 5 CD and FT-IR spectra for Aβ1–40 (20 μM)
both
in the presence and absence of PC (1 μg/mL). (a) CD spectra
of only Aβ1–40 (20 μM, black line), PC + Aβ
oligomers (red line), PC + Aβ fibrils (blue line), and PC +
CSF (green line) in 1 mM PBS at pH 7.4. FT-IR spectra for (b) Aβ1–40
(black) and CSF fibrils (red), (c) PC + Aβ oligomers (black),
PC + Aβ fibrils (red), and PC + CSF (blue).

This observation confirmed that PC successfully modulated
Aβ
oligomers and directed toward a different aggregation pathway as no
increase in β-sheet conformation was found, unlike controls.
Even in the case of prefibrillar Aβ1–40 (20 μM)
coincubated with PC (1 μg/mL), a small positive hump at 205
nm along with a negative peak at 194 nm appeared (Figure 5a, blue line). Ordered β-sheet
aggregation of Aβ1–40 required for final fibril formation
was proved to be disturbed in the presence of polymer conjugate PC
and followed a different pathway. Interestingly, in the case of real
human CSF (15 μM) coincubated with PC (1 μg/mL) we observed
a broad negative minimum from 210 to 230 nm and a positive maximum
at 191–194 nm. Unlike as observed for the commercial Aβ1–40
oligomers, where PC was able to enhance the total fraction of β-turn
and random coil formation, α-helicity was restored in the case
of real CSF sample (Figure 5a, green line). Individual time-dependent CD spectra of Aβ1–40
oligomer, prefibrillar aggregates, and CSF were given in Supporting Information (Figure S1).

Further,
to confirm the peptide secondary β-sheet formation,
we have recorded FT-IR spectra of both controls and coincubated with
polymeric conjugate (Figure 5b,c). In the case of controls, Aβ1–40 and CSF
showed a peak at 1633 cm–1 which indicated the presence
of β-sheet conformation (Figure 5b).24,25 As seen from CD studies, the
ordered peptide aggregation was disturbed in the presence of PC, as
seen in FT-IR amide band at 1640 cm–1 after 84 h
incubation (Figure 5c). Most likely, β-rich oligomers were trapped in the presence
of polymeric conjugate PC and due to the increased fraction of turn
as observed in CD spectra, amide β-band appeared in FT-IR spectra
in the presence of polymer conjugate. Further, these changes (modulation)
were visualized and confirmed using AFM images.

Morphological
Changes
Changes in amyloid aggregation
in the presence of PC and other polymer precursors were studied using
AFM. Aβ1–40 and CSF oligomers showed a similar AFM profile
(Figure 6a–c).
Aβ oligomers (Figure 6a) were 150 nm in diameter and 25 nm in height, whereas CSF
oligomers (Figure 6c) were approximately 300 nm in diameter with a similar height profile
as that of commercial Aβ1–40 oligomers (Figure S2). Preformed Aβ1–40 oligomers were incubated
with PC at 37 °C, and after 84 h, larger aggregates (Figure 6b) of diameter 0.6
μm and 50–60 nm height (Figure S2) were seen to have developed. PC was able to block the oligomers
from coming closer to each other and thus directed the peptide aggregation
in a different pathway, inhibiting the final fibril formation unlike
in the controls (Figure S3). Mature fibrils
of Aβ1–40 and CSF showed a diameter of 150 nm and the
average height was 6–9 nm. Further, to investigate the structural
contribution of other polymer conjugate precursors on amyloid aggregation,
Aβ1–40 oligomers were incubated separately with PFBr,
PFDPA, and chitosan (1 μg/mL) and the changes in amyloid aggregation
were captured after 84 h incubation at 37 °C (Figure S4). For the polyfluorene derivatives coincubated with
Aβ1–40 oligomers, larger aggregates of 0.6–0.8
μm in diameter and 70 nm in height resulted. Peptide oligomers
were trapped and no fibrillation had occurred. However, in the presence
of chitosan coincubated with peptide oligomers, the sparse population
of Aβ1–40 oligomers were visible along with chitosan
co-aggregates showing particles of two different diameters and height
profiles. Aβ1–40 oligomers showed a diameter of 100–150
and 20 nm in height as observed in controls and co-aggregates were
found to have a larger diameter of 300 and 70 nm in height. Morphological
observations suggested that a synergistic effect resulted in successful
inhibition of amyloid fibrillation of toxic oligomers in Aβ1–40
and in CSF in the presence of PC. A similar surface motif of PC helped
to adsorb the peptide oligomers to the polymeric surface and these
hydrophobic nanoparticles dispersed in water would be able to modulate
amyloid oligomers in Aβ1–40 and CSF to form mature fibrils.

Figure 6 AFM images
of (a) Aβ1–40 oligomers, (b) PC + Aβ1–40
oligomers, (c) CSF oligomers, and (d) PC + CSF oligomers. Images of
coincubated samples were taken after 84 h of incubation at 37 °C
in 10 mM PBS (pH 7.4), and Aβ1–40, CSF, and PC concentrations
were 20 μM, 15 μM, and 1 μg/mL. Scale bar for figure
A was 400 nm and for figure B–D is 1 μm.

Optical Correlation
Interestingly,
PC was able to optically
distinguish oligomers, unlike PFDPA. PFDPA orange emission in buffer
was blue-shifted to 434 nm in the presence of Aβ1–40
aggregates (both monomers and prefibrillar aggregates) because of
the formation of larger polyfluorene aggregates (as visible in AFM
images, Figure S4a,b). However, the polymeric
conjugate PC showed distinct optical features in the presence of oligomers.
To figure out the polymer–protein interaction, Aβ1–40
(20 μM) and CSF (15 μM) oligomers were incubated in the
presence of PC (2 mg/mL), and the optical spectrum of the coincubated
samples were recorded. PC coincubated with Aβ1–40 oligomers
showed an initial fluorescence emission at 570 nm (Figure 7a). Further incubation resulted
in an increase in the fluorescence intensity with a blue shift of
approximately 140 nm (Figure 7a, 429 nm) after 24 h incubation. Finally, a stable peak at
442 nm with a small hump at 543 nm appeared after 84 h incubation
(Figure S5a). Thus, because of the similar
surface, peptide oligomers were adsorbed onto the PC surface and the
hydrophobic polymeric conjugate was able to interact with peptide
oligomers. Finally, a stable polymeric aggregate was formed in the
presence of peptide oligomers. A similar outcome also appeared in
the presence of CSF oligomers (Figure 7b). An initial peak at 570 nm was blue-shifted at 436
nm after the immediate addition of CSF oligomers to the polymeric
solution. The response found in CSF was weaker compared to commercial
Aβ1–40 because of lesser concentration of Aβ in
CSF and the presence of preformed oligomers (immediate response was
better compared to Aβ1–40 coincubated sample). Finally,
in CSF coincubated with polymeric solution, a stable peak at 442 nm
and a small hump at 547 nm resulted after 84 h incubation as it was
observed in case of the Aβ1–40 coincubated sample (Figure S5b). To rule out the contribution of
polymeric aggregation, we have incubated pristine polymer solution
in 10 mM PBS buffer at 37 °C. No blue shift was observed in the
absence of peptide supporting the polymer–protein interaction.
From these optical changes, we confirmed the selectivity of PC on
Aβ1–40 oligomers over other precursor’s viz.,
PFBr, PFDPA, and chitosan. The selectivity studies were also performed,
and the fluorescence spectra of PC coincubated with neurotoxic brain
metals and other amino acids up to 100 μM were recorded. A decrease
in the initial polymeric peak at 570 nm was observed, but in no case
blue shift was found as observed in the presence of oligomers (Figure S6). Mutual aggregation resulted in a
stable optical response because of the probable interaction of polymer
conjugates and early amyloid aggregates or oligomers and formation
of distinct polymeric aggregates, which was highlighted in the optical
profile as a hypsochromic shift.

Discussion
Crossing the BBB is one of the chief hurdles
to deliver potential
therapeutic or diagnostic molecules to the brain. It is known that
there are approximately 100 billion capillaries and a BBB surface
area of 20 m2 in the human brain, as compared to much smaller
0.021 m2 for the blood–cerebral spinal fluid barrier
which controls entry of molecules via this barrier.19,20 To prescribe a successful modulator, one must address the two most
important factors, viz., targeting robust and heterogenic amyloid
aggregates and the ability to cross BBB. Conjugate polymer nanoparticles
have previously been reported as modulators of amyloid aggregates.23,26 In the present study, we have modified the conjugate polymer (polyfluorene,
PFDPA) nanoparticle with chitosan and utilized the polymeric composite
(PC) as a modulator. The primary thrust for the development of nanoparticles
is the hydrophobic effect as the polymer chains have a tendency to
abstain from water and therefore fold into round shapes.27 Additionally, these polymer nanoparticles did
not interact with free metals and other amino acids.28 ThT assay (Figure 4) and fluorescence studies (Figure 7) inferred that these nanoparticles can be
directed to target selectively Aβ oligomers. Further, distinct
optical response of PC in the presence of Aβ1–40 aggregates
(Figure 7b) confirmed
the formation of stable polymer–peptide co-aggregates. The
formation of these co-aggregates was confirmed by morphological studies
(Figure 6b,d), and
CD spectra showed no parallel β-sheet formation in the peptide
secondary structures (Figure 5a). Weak amide stretching shifted to 1640 cm–1 from 1633 cm–1 in the presence of PC inferred
the coexistence of both polymer and protein oligomers but directed
amyloid aggregation into a nonfibrillar pathway as evident from AFM
images. In oligomers, the hydrophobic core is placed deep inside,
and therefore, they are more robust to modulate. A similar structural
motif (Figure 1) helped
them to adsorb into the polymer surface, and thus, the proximity to
other oligomers is prohibited (Figure 6b) and thus modulated final fibril formation. Nevertheless,
several other issues remain to be checked, which includes the essential
function of BBB through influx and efflux in the presence of PC and
how the brain plasticity changes after in vivo experiments, but these
are presently beyond the existing scope. Finally, a new structural
motif has been presented with an idea of how to prevent or attack
early amyloid aggregates in order to prevent presenile dementia. This
will definitely benefit to understand the early aggregation and develop
biomarkers to slow neurodegeneration.

Conclusions
In
summary, this new polymer conjugate (polyfluorene–chitosan,
PC) was able to optically sense oligomers as well as modulate the
toxic amyloid aggregates in Aβ1–40 and in CSF. ThT assay
showed a response in the growth phase targeting the prefibrillar aggregates
which were further validated by fluorescence emission of the polymer
conjugate in the presence of in vitro Aβ1–40 and CSF
oligomers. Precursor polyfluorene derivatives were also shown to inhibit
amyloid aggregation as well, indicating a synergistic effect played
an important role in modulating amyloid oligomers. CD spectra showed
no parallel β-sheet formation which is considered as the pathological
progression of amyloid aggregation and results in fibril formation
and has been modulated by the polymer conjugate. PC was also able
to cross BBB efficiently irrespective of the molecular weight of the
additive without disintegrating the endothelial monolayer, unlike
polyfluorene precursors. Hydrophobic conjugate nanoparticles can be
made efficient amyloid modulators, which not only can cross BBB efficiently
but also can target selectively the early neurotoxic amyloid oligomers
and modulate these robust aggregates into a nonpathological pathway.
We believe that our findings may open a new hope of making therapeutic
nanomaterials that can be used to predict and fight against Alzheimer’s
and presenile dementia.

Experimental Procedures
Materials
Chitosan
low molecular weight (PC2) and high
molecular weight (PC3), di-(2-picolyl)amine, 1,6-dibromohexane, fluorene,
ferric chloride, potassium carbonate, PBS, HFIP, TFA, Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), and other
chemicals were obtained from Merck, Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals, Ranbaxy
(India) and used as received. GL Biochem Ltd., Shanghai, China supplied
the human amyloid-β (1–40). CSF and human samples were
collected from Guwahati Neurological Research Center and Hospital,
Six Mile, Guwahati, India.

Synthesis of PFDPA and PC
Fluorene
molecules were first
alkylated using 1,6-dibromohexane in 50% aqueous sodium hydroxide,
and the crude was purified using column chromatography, which was
done using eluent hexane to obtain the desired doubly alkylated product
as a viscous yellow liquid. Then, the purified double alkylated monomer
was polymerized via oxidative polymerization using ferric chloride
as a catalyst and nitrobenzene as a solvent under an argon atmosphere.
The resulting polymer was precipitated in methanol and dried under
vacuum, and finally, to prepare PFDPA, appended bromines were substituted
by di-(2-picolyl)amine in dimethylformamide and K2CO3. The desired polymer PFDPA was purified via precipitation
from methanol, and the attachment was confirmed via 1H
and 13C NMR spectra in chloroform-d (Scheme S1).23 For
preparing the nanoconjugates (PFDPA–chitosan, PC), chitosan
(100 μg of 1 mg/mL) was added in 1 mL of PFDPA (1 mg/mL) in
an Eppendorf (vortex condition) for 30 min. The orange-brown intense
PC nanoconjugate solution was ultracentrifuged (14 000 rpm
at 4 °C for 30 min). The PC nanoconjugate pellet (50 μL)
was utilized for all the studies. PFDPA was also centrifuged under
similar conditions, and the pellet was used to compare with PC (Scheme S1) for all experiments.

Instrumentation
AFM images were taken using Bruker,
Innova, with noncontact tapping mode using a large scanner. Malvern
Zetasizer Nano series Nano-ZS90 instrument was used to measure dynamic
light scattering. CD measurements were done in a JASCO J-1500-150
spectrometer (JASCO Co. Tokyo, Japan), using a quartz cuvette (1 mm
path length). NMR spectra of PFBr, PFDPA, and precursor monomers were
taken in a Bruker Ascend 600 MHz spectrometer using CDCl3 as a solvent. ThT fluorescence measurements were done in a Tecan
microplate reader using Corning 96 flat bottom black, clear bottom
polystyrene cat. no. 3631 plate reader. The fluorescence spectra was
recorded in 1 mL solution, with a 10 mm × 10 mm quartz cuvette,
collecting the emission at 90° relative to the excitation beam
using FluoroMax-4 spectrofluorometer-Horiba Scientific.

In Vitro Cell
Viability and BBB Assay
To check the
intrinsic toxicity of all the precursor polymers (PFBr, PFDPA) along
with the final conjugate (PC), in vitro toxicity was studied by both
hemolysis assay and the MTT cell survival assay with RBCs and Ea hy926.1,
respectively, as described in our previous report.29 Endothelial cells (EA hy926.1) were harvested in DMEM (HiMedia)
with 10% FBS (Gibco) and antibiotics (Anti–Anti, Gibco) at
37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator, and 25 000 cells
were seeded per well in a 96-well plate. The cells were treated with
different concentrations of PFBr, PFDPA, and PCs (0–100 μg/mL)
for 12 h, and the cell survival was determined by standard MTT assay.

Prior to cell viability, in vitro BBB assay was performed by making
an endothelial monolayer barrier. Briefly, endothelial cells were
seeded in a special cell culture plate (60 mm), which possesses 3
μm pores for crossing. Endothelial cells were grown densely
till completely sealing the pores. This plate was maintained in a
100 mm sterile plate with an adequate amount of media. PFBr, PFDPA,
and PC solutions (50 μg/mL) were prepared in complete media
and gently added in three different 60 mm dishes (upper chamber),
and the media was collected from the 100 mm dish (lower chamber) after
every 1 h interval till 6 h. Further, the permeability was checked
by measuring fluorescence of all the test compounds. Leakage was corrected
by using Evans blue as a control and to calculate the actual permeability
of the precursor polymers and conjugates.

Preparation of Stock Solution
PFDPA and PFBr stock
solutions (1 mM) were prepared in 10 mL of THF and diluted to necessary
concentrations for further incubation during modulation and imaging
studies. PC conjugates were prepared at a concentration 20 mg/mL in
10 mM deionized water, and finally, 1 mg/mL was diluted in PBS for
modulation studies. All the experiments such as UV–visible,
FT-IR and fluorescence titrations were performed in 10 mM PBS buffer
and pH maintained at 7.4. PFDPA (10 μM) was injected into deionized
water at regular intervals with vigorous stirring at room temperature
and filtered via a membrane filter with 0.2 μm pore size and
used for other studies. Chitosan was dissolved in 2% acetic acid solution
and the conjugates were freshly prepared in deionized water.

Oligomerization
of Aβ(1–40)
TFA/HFIP was
used to disaggregate Aβ(1–40) initially following an
earlier protocol24 to obtain a final concentration
of 0.2 mM. Then, it was kept at 37 °C for 24 h in dark conditions
for oligomerization and confirmed by recording AFM images using a
Bruker, Innova instrument. Further fibril formation and modulation
were examined with ThT fluorescence assay in a Tecan microplate reader.

Preparation of Aβ1–40 Aggregates and ThT Binding
Assay
Aβ1–40 and CSF were used as a source of
amyloid oligomers. Aggregation of Aβ1–40 (20 μM)
was examined by incubating with ThT (40 μM) at 37 °C for
24 h (pH 7.4 in 10 mM PBS) without stirring to prepare oligomeric
amyloid peptide aggregates. Further, aggregation of Aβ1–40
amyloid fibrils were checked both in the presence and absence of modulators
with different time incubations by regularly monitoring ThT (40 μM)
fluorescent enhancement peak at λem 482 nm (λex 440 nm) using a microplate reader. Similarly to confirm
the presence of Aβ aggregates in human CSF sample, first ThT
fluorescence was measured in the saline buffer and corrected with
Aβ1–40 reading as a control. AFM images validated the
presence of CSF oligomers, which similarly formed mature fibrils on
further incubation in saline buffer.

Modulating Experiment for
Aβ1–40 Aggregates
The ability of the polymeric
conjugate (PC) to modulate oligomers
was studied by recording the changes in the fluorescence spectra in
the presence of Aβ1–40 in commercial and in real CSF
samples as well as studying CD spectra to investigate the changes
in the secondary structure. The samples were prepared in the final
volume of 1 mL in 10 mM PBS (pH 7.4) buffer and incubated at 37 °C
with Aβ1–40 and CSF separately. Fluorescence spectra
were recorded at a different time intervals to correlate protein aggregation
and the optical signal of the polymeric conjugate. First, when Aβ1–40
oligomers were incubated with PC (2 mg/mL) solution and excited at
polymeric conjugate excitation (364 nm), we observed an initial emission
peak at 570 nm. Changes after further incubation (0–84 h) at
37 °C (pH 7.4) were monitored carefully. Finally, a similar study
was repeated with the preformed Aβ fibril as well as real CSF
sample. All the measurements were recorded in a fluorescence spectrophotometer
(Horiba, FluoroMax 4) at 293 K and 2 nm × 2 nm excitation and
emission slit widths.
