The identification of suitable density functional methods
for predicting
the properties of nanoporous composite materials is highly significant
in the field of chemical and material sciences. The stability of the
composite materials depends on the nature of bonding and dispersive
interaction at the interface. Thus, we have studied the effect of
dispersion correction in the incorporation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic
ionic liquids (ILs) into zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8)
nanostructures using the density functional theory (DFT)-based approaches.
These structures were analyzed employing selected methods (Becke–Lee–Yang–Parr
and Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof) with dispersion correction
(D2 or D3) and different basis sets (such as double-zeta valence polarized
(DZVP), triple-zeta valence polarized (TZVP), and triple-zeta valence
doubly polarized (TZV2P)) for the understanding of microscopic features
of IL@ZIF-8 nanopores. It is found that the result obtained from DFT-D2/TZVP
is more reliable for the prediction of the experimental crystal structure
as well as stability and spectral information of the complexes. Furthermore,
the microscopic analysis of geometries reveals that ILs are highly
dispersed and stabilized at the nanopores of ZIF-8, particularly the
ZIF-8 structure is highly preferable for the hydrophobic group in
ILs. It is found that fluorine-containing anions are highly dispersed
on the ZIF-8 surface compared to the nonfluorinated anion (i.e., [BMIM]+[Cl]−). This is confirmed from the adsorption
energies (Eads), charge transfer, electron
density analyses, and IR spectral analysis. These findings can provide
more insights into the stability of composite materials, which are
suitable for applications of catalytic conversion at the confined
state, gas storage, and separation techniques.

1 Introduction
Ionic liquids (ILs) are
emerging class of solvents,1 which are
liquids below 100 °C and find its application
in various fields such as catalysis,2 green
solvent,3 clean energy,4 etc. They have widespread applications in many fields,
mainly because of their thermal stability, negligible vapor pressure,
tunability, and low volatility.5 Imidazolium
cation-based ILs form a major class of ILs.6 The high viscosity of ILs is always a limiting factor for the use
of it in real-time applications. To avoid this limitation, we can
support ILs over different membranes.7 These
supporting materials can be either 2D (e.g., graphene or metal surfaces)
or 3D nanoporous materials. These are called as supported ionic liquid
membranes (SILMs) and form an outstanding category of materials for
various applications such as gas storage, separation, and catalysis.8−13

Among 3D supporting materials, metal–organic frameworks
(MOFs)14,15 are receiving widespread attention in the
fields of catalysis,16 gas storage,17 drug delivery,18,19 etc. These
MOFs have several advantages like high surface area, thermal and chemical
stability, and tunable pore size.20,21 Zeolitic imidazolate
frameworks (ZIFs) are subclass of MOFs, whose structural features
are analogous to that of zeolites. ZIF-8 exhibits a cubic sodalite
(SOD) structure and is known for its structural flexibility and stability
with the larger pore volume and surface area.22 SILMs can be prepared by incorporating ILs into the pores of ZIF-8,
thus overcoming their limitation of high viscosity.23,24 SILMs show very high stability in liquid/liquid and gas/gas separations
at high temperature and pressure.25 Organic
compounds, mixed gases, and metal ions can be easily separated using
these ionic liquid membranes.26 Implementation
on large scale, cost-effectiveness, reusability, and stability under
real-time applications still remains unresolved for SILMs.

Several
experimental and theoretical studies have been devoted
to realize the properties and applications of various ZIFs and IL-based
composites.24,27−30 ILs@MOF composites are used in
many applications such as selective separation of CO2/CH4,30 ionic conductor,31 catalysis, etc.32 Recent reports reveal that the ILs@ZIF-8 pore can enhance the properties
of ZIF-8 for gas storage and separation.33,34 Kinik et al. reported that incorporation of imidazolium-based IL,
[BMIM][PF6], can double the CO2 selectivity
of ZIF-8.34 Fujie and co-workers reported
that introducing ILs (EMIM-TFSA) into the micropores of ZIF-8 helps
to stabilize IL at a lower temperature. This study proves that the
incorporation of ILs into ZIFs can provide a novel methodology for
the stabilization of ILs.35 This material
can also be used as a low-temperature ionic conductor.31 Even though there are many experimental studies
available on IL@ZIF composites, there is a lack of evidence about
the microscopic interaction at nanostructures of ILs@ZIFs. Computational
tools are very useful in predicting the interactions of MOFs and ILs,
which cannot be explained using experimental techniques. There are
different computational methodologies developed in the last few years
for MOF-based systems.36,37 Selection of suitable computational
methods for the prediction of composites has always been a difficult
task.

Since these composites are bulk materials, the computing
cost of
electronic structure calculations is tremendous. Even though force
field-based simulations38 are convenient
to study the properties of composite materials, density functional
theory (DFT) approaches are receiving widespread attention because
of its prime usage in material sciences.39,40 DFT-based functional methods are more viable for the prediction
of the accurate structure, stability, and cell parameters of the bulk
surface with their basis on quantum mechanical aspects. DFT-based
methods are really important in computer-aided modeling of different
materials, but one shortcoming of DFT is its poor prediction of van
der Waals (vdWs) and noncovalent interactions.41 However, recent developments in DFT methods and involvement
of dispersion correction with split valance basis sets are more suitable
to identify the microscopic features and structural flexibility of
the materials.42,43 Inclusion of dispersion correction
in the calculations can give a picture about how exact the dispersive
interactions affect the stability and structure of IL-based composite
materials. There are various DFT methods available for the study of
bulk scale materials, which are based on local density approximation
(LDA),44 generalized gradient approximation
(GGA),45 hybrid GGA,46 meta-GGA,47 and hybrid meta-GGA.48

The number of studies based on dispersion-corrected
DFT is increasing
every year. The vdW density functional (vdW-DF)49 and dispersion-corrected DFT (DFT-D)50 are two major approaches for treating dispersive interactions.
Even though vdW-DF methods have similar computational cost to DFT-D,
this approach increases the computational time by 50% compared to
a normal GGA calculation.51 Galvelis and
co-workers studied the relative stability of zinc and lithium–boron
ZIFs using DFT methods with different dispersion corrections (DFT-D)
and found that DFT-D gives a better description of the framework than
DFT.52 Walker and co-workers studied the
effect of dispersion forces on the reversible switching of MIL-53(Al)
between large pore (lp) and narrow pore (np). They found that dispersion-corrected
DFT (both DFT-D and vdW-DF) can stabilize the low-temperature np phase.
They summarized that dispersion can predict different phase transitions
and sorption properties of MOF materials.53 From all these studies, it is clear that incorporation dispersive
correction (either D2 or D3) plays an important role in the prediction
of structural features of nanoporous materials such as MOFs, ZIFs,
and SILMs. For instance, recently, we found that the adsorption properties
of CO2 can be tuned by the selection of suitable ILs for
the composite materials.54 Also, we found
that the DFT-D3 method is more reliable for the structure and stability
of the complexes.

In the present study, the selection of suitable
DFT methods for
the prediction of the structure and stability of various IL-based
SILM materials with the ZIF-8 framework is investigated. Incorporation
of dispersion correction is very important to predict the structural
flexibility and cell parameters of composite materials. Thus, we have
selected well-known DFT methods such as BLYP and PBE with and without
dispersion correction. The structure, stability, spectral data (IR),
and charge transfer between ILs@ZIF-8 complexes are analyzed using
the selected DFT methods. The obtained results were compared with
the experimental crystal structure of ZIF-8 and also with results
obtained from the Gaussian basis set approach. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first report on the involvement of the DFT
method and the effect of dispersion correction for the prediction
of the nanoporous structure with and without ILs. This study is helpful
to predict the suitable composite materials for the applications in
catalysis, ionic conductors, gas storage, separation, sensor, etc.

2 Results and Discussion
To study the
effect of various DFT methods on nanoporous composite
materials, we have chosen the ZIF-8 crystal structure with different
hydrophilic/hydrophobic ILs. Here, all these ILs are stabilized at
nanopores of ZIF-8 and the resulting structure is represented as the
composite material (i.e., IL@ZIF-8). The cell optimization was carried
out to know the composite stability along with the crystal lattice
parameters. These parameters are helpful to study the effect of interaction
of ILs with nanopores and corresponding changes in the volume with
respect to the original crystal structure. Even though the crystal
structure shows exceptional flexibility under various conditions such
as temperature, pressure, solvent, host–guest interactions,
etc.,55−57 its effect is found to be negligible in the case
of adsorption of gases such as CO2 and CH4.58 The structural changes in the empty crystal
as well as in the composites were analyzed.

In addition, the
composite structure and stability are analyzed
using DFT functionals (BLYP and PBE) for the study of solid–liquid
interfacial materials. It was found from our previous studies that
PBE and PBE-D3 methods were able to predict the adsorption of various
ILs on the Au(111) surface and also the effect of alkyl groups on
the stability ILs@Au(111) surfaces.59,60 Another study
reveals that PBE with dispersion correction is more efficient for
the prediction of the structure and stability of the zinc and lithium–boron-based
ZIFs.52 Thus, the incorporation of dispersion
correction is vital for the investigation of composite materials.
Thus, we compared the cell parameters obtained from DFT methods with
different basis sets and dispersion corrections for all the ILs@ZIF-8.
A detailed discussion of the structure, stability, IR spectra, and
charge-transfer process of the complexes with suitable methods is
given in the following sections.

2.1 Optimization of the Crystal Structure of ZIF-8
at Different DFT Methods
The crystal structure was obtained
from the experimental crystallographic data.22 The cubic sodalite structure of the ZIF-8 unit cell is comprised
of 276 (the repeating unit is Zn-(imidazole)4) framework
atoms. The unit cell optimization was carried out using different
DFT methods and dispersion correction with the combination of suitable
basis sets.

The optimized cell parameters and corresponding
changes in volume after optimization of the ZIF-8 structure are provided
in Table 1. The table
shows that BLYP and PBE methods with the TZVP basis set (for nonmetal
atoms) predict significantly larger volume and overestimate the experimental
crystal structure, without dispersion correction. The changes in volume
at BLYP and PBE methods are 8.9 and 5.7%, respectively. With the incorporation
of dispersion correction in above methods, it shows very significant
changes in the parameters. Thus, we have added D2 and D3 corrections
in the optimization of the framework to study the structure and stability
of the composite materials. It is interesting to note that the cell
parameters obtained after the incorporation of D2 correction with
above methods did not deviate significantly from the crystal structure
(i.e., ∼0.3%). The same changes for BLYP-D3 and PBE-D3 corrections
are 1.8 and 2.2%, respectively. This reveals that the inclusion of
dispersion correction is very important for the prediction of the
minimized crystal structure. In addition, the expansion of the basis
set for the heteroatom (i.e., TZV2P) with D3 dispersion correction
further reduces the volume changes. Among the above results, BLYP-D2
and PBE-D2 methods are in excellent agreement with the experimental
structure and also the selected basis set (TZVP) is more reliable
for the prediction of the structure of ZIF-8. Although the DFT-D3
with the TZV2P method is reliable, the computational cost is slightly
higher. Thus, we have considered DFT-D2 with the TZVP method for the
general discussion.

the TZV2P basis set except for Zn (DZVP).

It is found from Figure 1 that combination of DFT with D2 is more
precise predicting
the crystal structure of ZIF-8 with a less computational cost. In
addition, to validate our results, we have also studied the structural
optimization at the Gaussian basis set method using the RPBE/6-31G
level of theory. The comparison of cell parameters and corresponding
volume changes is provided in Table 1. The calculated volume change obtained from this methods
is ∼4.7% and the volume is slightly enhanced when compared
to DFT-D calculations. This clearly reveals that the inclusion of
dispersion correction is very important for the prediction of the
experimental crystal structure of ZIFs with more accuracy.

represents the volume change in the percentage of ZIF-8 using different
DFT methods with and without dispersion correction.

2.2 Optimization of Different ILs@ZIF-8
A similar methodology is implemented for the investigation of composite
materials containing ILs. We have selected the 1-butyl 3-methylimidazolium
([BMIM]+) cation with different hydrophilic (chloride [Cl]− and trifluoroacetate [CF3CO2]−) and hydrophobic (tetrafluoroborate [BF4]− and hexafluorophosphate [PF6]−) anions. These ILs were impregnated within the
cavity of ZIF-8 and optimization was carried out without fixing any
atomic positions in the cell. These composites were studied using
different approaches to analyze the structural changes happening to
them.

2.2.1 Hydrophilic ILs@ZIF-8
The hydrophilic
ILs chosen are [BMIM][Cl] and [BMIM][CF3CO2],
and this is incorporated into the pores of ZIF-8 to make a composite
material. After optimization, the lattice parameters and volume changes
were noted for both the composites. The optimized crystal cell parameters,
volume, and percentage of volume changes are given in Table 2 and Supporting Information Table S1. The percentage of change in volume
is calculated with the reference to the experimental crystal structure.
In the case of [BMIM][Cl], the BLYP method shows significant changes
in the unit cell length values (a, b, and c) and the respective volume also enhances.
The cell expansion values for BLYP and PBE methods are 8.8 and 5.6%,
respectively. Here onward, the calculated PBE values are shown in
parenthesis. When BLYP-D2 is used, the volume is very close to the
experimental value and the change in volume is almost negligible,
that is, around 0.1% (0.7%). BLYP-D3 is slightly overestimating the
experimental crystal structure, and it predicts a volume change of
∼1.9% (1.9%). When BLYP-D3/TZV2P is used, it predicts that
the lattice parameters are slightly better than that in the BLYP-D3/TZVP
method, which corresponds to a change of 1.7% (1.8%), but as mentioned
earlier, it is a highly time-consuming process. Among these methods,
BLYP-D2/TZVP shows close agreement with the experimental data and
the bar diagram of the same is depicted in Figure 2. Table S1 gives
all the optimized parameters for [BMIM][CF3CO2]. From the table, it is clear that both BLYP and PBE methods with
D2 correction predict the accurate crystal structure, like in the
case of [BMIM][Cl]. Their percentages of volume changes correspond
to 0.3 and 0.5, respectively. However, without dispersion correction,
these two methods could not predict a reliable crystal structure.
With D3 correction and DFT-D3/TZV2P, both the methods show volume
changes of ∼2%. From all the analyses discussed above, it is
clear that for hydrophilic ILs@ZIF-8 complexes, GGA methods such as
BLYP and PBE can closely predict the crystal parameters with Grimme’s
D2 dispersion correction.

in the percentage
of hydrophilic [BMIM][Cl] and hydrophobic [BMIM][BF4]@ZIF-8
with different methods.

2.2.2 Hydrophobic ILs@ZIF-8
For making
hydrophobic IL-based composites, [BMIM][BF4] and [BMIM][PF6] were selected. The adsorption properties of hydrophobic
ILs at hydrophobic cages are different due to their similar hydrophobicities.60 Above discussed methodologies are followed for
the optimization of the hydrophobic ILs@ZIF-8 and the corresponding
changes are noted. The unit cell parameters and volume changes are
given in Table 3 and
Supporting Information Table S2 for hydrophobic
ILs. Table 3 gives
the comparison of different methods for [BMIM][BF4]@ZIF-8.
Without dispersion correction, both BLYP and PBE are overestimating
the unit cell parameters and hence show a huge volume expansion. Those
correspond to percentage volume changes of 9.1 and 5.6, respectively.
With D2 correction, the corresponding volume changes for BLYP and
PBE methods are 0.2 and 0.6%. Both BLYP and PBE with D3 dispersion
and the TZVP basis set show expansion of around ∼1.9%. The
same values obtained from the DFT-D3/TZV2P basis set are close to
the TZVP basis set. It is also represented in Figure 2, which shows that DFT-D2 can accurately
predict the rigid crystal structure of ZIF-8, after the incorporation
of ILs. Similarly, another hydrophobic IL, [BMIM][PF6]
was also analyzed using various DFT methods. Its optimized parameters
are given in Table S2. Here, also we observed
a similar trend in the unit cell parameters with the incorporation
of dispersion correction.

a DZVP basis set considered for Zn
atom and TZVP for all other atoms in ZIF-8.

b Structures were optimized using
the TZV2P basis set except for Zn and B (DZVP).

Close scrutiny of the above parameters confirms that
D2 dispersion-corrected
DFT methods are well suited for the prediction of composite materials.
In particular, DFT-D2/TZVP predicts the best suitable results, which
mimics the experimental crystal structure and already available simulation
results. The earlier report reveals that dispersion correction is
very important to study the relative stability of Zn and LiB ZIFs.
They found that PBE-D3 correction is good for the ZIF structure.52 However, in the present study, with impregnated
ILs inside the 3D pores of the ZIF-8 structure, the experimental values
are in good agreement with the DFT-D2 (BLYP and PBE) method. This
is the first report on the effect of the involvement of dispersion
correction in the structure of the composite material. In the present
study, we also optimized the composite structure with the RPBE method
and Gaussian basis set approach. The average values of cell parameters
and respective volume changes for the composites are mentioned in
corresponding tables (Table 2 and 3 and Tables S1 and S2). The calculated unit cell parameters obtained from
the RPBE method are varied from the experimental crystal structure
(∼4.5%). Meanwhile, the structure prediction from hybrid basis
set formalism61 (i.e., mixing of Gaussian
and plane-wave basis (GPW)) is working well for the host–guest
interaction between ZIF-8 and ILs. The calculated parameters are in
good accordance with earlier reports.62,63

2.3 Geometries and Energetics of ILs@ZIF-8
To validate the adsorption energies (Eads) obtained from hybrid formalism, we calculated the same using the
Gaussian basis set approach. The Eads values
of all the hydrophilic/hydrophobic IL complexes are provided in the
respective tables (Table 2 and 3 and Tables S1 and S2). Since the geometry obtained from DFT-D2 and DFT-D3
methods is in excellent agreement with the experimental crystal structure,
only their energetics is discussed in this section. The Eads obtained from BLYP-D3 shows more repulsion when compared
to the other methods. However, all other methods are predicting an
attractive interaction between ZIF-8 and ILs. The calculated Eads is highly varied depending on the selection
of dispersion correction and basis sets for the complexes. The comparison
of Eads obtained from Gaussian basis with
the hybrid basis formalism approach shows that DFT-D2 correction is
more reliable than the DFT-D3/TZVP method. Thus, here onward, we considered Eads obtained from the DFT-D2 method for further
discussions. From close analysis, it can be found that DFT with the
D2 dispersion approach is very good for the prediction of the structure
and energetics of the composite materials. The Eads is in direct relation with the geometrical arrangement
of ion pairs of IL at the pores of the ZIF-8 structure. Also, some
of the ions are directly adsorbed on the surface of ZIFs. To analyze
the microscopic adsorption mechanism of ILs at nanopores, the optimized
geometries of all the hydrophilic and hydrophobic IL@ZIF-8 complexes
using DFT-D2 are given in Figure 3 and the same geometries for DFT-D3 are given in Supporting
Information Figure S1.

Figure 3 Optimized geometries
of hydrophilic/hydrophobic ILs@ZIF-8 at different
DFT-D2 methods with the shortest interacting distances.

Figure 3 shows the
adsorption of the IL ion pair in the cavity of ZIF-8 along with the
important distances (in Å). The optimized geometries show that
the ion pair distances varied depending on the anionic part. For example,
[BMIM][Cl]@ZIF-8 shows a stronger hydrogen bond (i.e., ∼2.0
Å) in all DFT methods. Also, the anionic part of IL is localized
in the cavity with a distance of ∼4.21 Å. It is found
from the calculations that Eads for [BMIM][Cl]@ZIF-8
predicted by the PBE-D2 method is significantly higher when compared
to other methods. This is due to the interaction of the −CH3 group with the ZIF-8 surface and this leads to enhancement
of the binding strength (i.e., Eads).
The adsorption energies obtained from BLYP-D2 and PBE-D2 are −13.28
and −24.53 kcal/mol, respectively. The same Eads obtained from the RPBE/6-31G method is −13.15
kcal/mol. It is interesting to note that BLYP-D2 is close to the energies
obtained from the RPBE method with 6-31G basis. A less Eads (∼−13 kcal/mol) is observed when the
butyl group is interacting with the surfaces instead of the −CH3 group. A similar kind of observation is also found in the
host–guest encapsulation of drug molecules in the p-sulfonatocalix[4]arene derivatives.64 In the case of the [CF3CO2]− anion, the BLYP-D2 method predicts higher Eads (i.e., −30.37 kcal/mol) compared to other methods.
Also, the stability of the complex is significantly higher due to
the stronger interaction of the −CF3 group in the
anion with the ZIF surface. The energies obtained from PBE-D2 and
RPBE/6-31G are −26.17 and – 20.33 kcal/mol, respectively.
The Eads obtained from the PBE method
is very close to Gaussian basis when compared with the BLYP method.
Due to the unreliable energies obtained at the DFT methods without
dispersion, we have excluded those Eads from the discussions.

In the case of hydrophobic ILs, the
calculated Eads by DFT-D ranges from −21
to −52 kcal/mol.
Their optimized geometries at the DFT-D2 level are given in Figure 3. Even though these
two anions are strongly adsorbed on the cavity of ZIF-8, it is interesting
to note that the [PF6]− anion is strongly
adsorbed than the [BF4]− anion. PBE-D2
and BLYP-D2 methods predict stronger adsorption for [BMIM][BF4] and [BMIM][PF6], respectively. The Eads values of [BMIM][BF4]@ZIF-8 at BLYP-D2
and PBE-D2 methods are −21.11 and −27.18 kcal/mol, respectively.
The same values obtained for the [PF6]− anion are −52.72 and – 35.49 kcal/mol, respectively.
[BMIM][PF6]@ZIF-8 has higher adsorption compared to other
complexes. This arises from the stronger binding of the fluorinated
anion with the metal centers of the ZIF-8 framework. The calculated
trends in Eads are varied depending on
the selection of a suitable method and basis set with the dispersion
correction term. Here, we limited our discussions to DFT-D2 energies.
The order of adsorption strength of ILs@ZIF-8 using the BLYP-D2 method
is [BMIM][PF6] > [BMIM][CF3CO2] >
[BMIM][BF4] > [BMIM][Cl], whereas the PBE-D2 method
predicts
slightly different. The order of strength at the PBE-D2 method is
[BMIM][PF6] > [BMIM][BF4] ∼ [BMIM][CF3CO2] > [BMIM][Cl]. The order of Eads obtained from RPBE/6-31G Gaussian basis is well matching
with that of the hybrid formalism. The optimized geometries of all
ILs@ZIF-8 composites using RPBE/6-31G are given in Supporting Information Figure S2. All three methods predicted the similar
trend in the stability of the complexes, interfacial interactions,
and charge density.

This confirms the selection of suitable
functional for the bulk
phase optimization of the ILs@ZIF-8 structure. Since Gaussian basis
calculations require more computational power, we have limited the
optimization at the RPBE/6-31G level of theory. Also, our results
suggest that hybrid formalism is more reliable for the bulk composite
materials and predicts the interfacial interactions between ILs and
the ZIF-8 structure. In addition, these methods are helpful to analyze
the structural flexibility of the ZIF-8 structures. Even though there
are previous discussions on the stability of ZIF-8 with different
DFT-D methods, this is the first report on the discussion of IL@ZIF-8
complexes for the selection of more reliable DFT-D methods in comparison
with the Gaussian basis approach. Through the selection of appropriate
DFT methods for IL@ZIF-8 complexes, we can explore the wide range
of applications of these complexes in the fields of catalysis, gas
storage and separation, ionic conductivity, etc.

2.4 Vibrational Spectral Analysis of IL@ZIF-8
Complexes
The effect of adsorption of ILs on ZIF-8 nanostructures
can be studied from the vibrational analysis of the complexes. The
calculated IR spectra of the ILs@ZIF-8 complexes and pure components
are provided in Figures 4 and 5. The description of respective vibrational
frequencies and shift values along with the experimental data is given
in Supporting Information Table S3. The
important shifts are denoted using blue and red color triangles in Figures 4 and 5. It is found that there is a significant shift in vibrational
frequencies of ILs after incorporation into ZIF-8. Depending on the
nature of interaction and charge transfer, it may shift toward either
a higher frequency (blue shift) or lower frequency (red shift) region.
These shifts help to identify the specific interactions and strength
of IL@ZIF-8 complexes. All the vibrational frequencies for ZIF-8 and
IL@ZIF-8 are calculated at the PBE-D2/TZVP method. The PBE/6-311G*
method is used for the IL ion pairs. All the spectra were visualized
and analyzed by using the Molden software program.65,66Figure 4 shows three
broad bands (above ν 1600 cm–1) for the ZIF-8
structure and, in these, two peaks were assigned for the symmetric
(singlet, νss 2933–2962 cm–1) and asymmetric stretching (singlet, νas 3005–3067
cm–1) of the CH3 group in imidazolium.
The third peak was assigned for the symmetric (νss 3187–3198 cm–1) and asymmetric (νas 3166–3175 cm–1) C–H stretching
of C3 and C4 carbons in the imidazolium linker. Furthermore, below
1600 cm–1, three broad bands are observed. They
are in-plane C–H bending of C3 and C4 carbons (δ 1084–1165
cm–1), CH3 deformation bending (δ
1366–1475 cm–1), and carbon–carbon
double bond stretching between C3 and C4 (ν 1484–1499
cm–1). It is important to note that calculated IR
frequencies are in very close agreement with the experimental values
of [BMIM][PF6]@ZIF-834 and [BMIM][CF3CO2].67 Our calculations
prove that the selected DFT (PBE-D2/TZVP) methodology can predict
the properties of composite materials and these results are comparable
with the experiment.

with spectra
of ZIF-8 and ILs.

In hydrophilic [BMIM][Cl]@ZIF-8, the ion pair interaction
in IL
(i.e., C2–H···Cl) is slightly weakened after
complexation with the ZIF-8 structure. This is observed through blue
shifted (∼20 cm–1) values of C2–H
stretching (∼2475 cm–1). At the same time,
the [Cl]− anion is strongly H-bonded with the butyl
group and the respective red shift is ∼126 cm–1. While in the [BMIM][CF3CO2]@ZIF-8 complex,
the C2–H stretching is red shifted (∼306 cm–1). This proves the enhancement of H-bond (∼1.8 Å) strength
between the anion and imidazolium ring of the cation in [BMIM][CF3CO2] while incorporating with ZIF-8. This is absent
in the case of [BMIM][Cl]@ZIF-8. After incorporation of the [CF3CO2]− anion, the OCO vibration
modes show blue shifts (∼18 and 26 cm–1).
This indicates the weakening of the C–O bond, which attributes
to an electron sharing of the anion between the surface and cation.
This leads to direct interaction of the anion with the surface, which
contributes to the higher charge transfer observed for this complex
(Section 2.5). The
observed electrostatic behavior can enhance the binding strength of
the IL@ZIF-8. The interaction of [BMIM][Cl] with the ZIF-8 surface
is very weak, which corresponds to a low red shift range of 2–4
cm–1 in ring C–H stretching. However, in
the [BMIM][CF3CO2]@ZIF-8 complex, the red shift
range is 8–10 cm–1. This is good accordance
with the calculated Eads values.

In the case of hydrophobic ILs, the ion pair interaction strength
is enhanced and the corresponding red shift ranges from 34 to 107
cm–1. This concludes that ion pair interactions
are strengthened at the confined environment except for the [Cl]− anion. It is important to note that the C3–H
and C4–H symmetric (νss) and asymmetric (νas) vibrational stretching bands are red shifted (∼24
cm–1) and the respective peaks are observed at 3228
and 3209 cm–1. The hydrophobic anions ([PF6]− and [BF4]−) directly
interact with the surface, and the respective interaction modes are
shown in Figure 5.
These values are well matching with the available experimental results.28,34 Furthermore, the C–H stretching of the ZIF-8 structure in
the complex shows red shift from 2 to 8 cm–1 in
both the hydrophobic ILs. This clearly reveals that there is an interaction
between ILs and the ZIF-8 structure. Particularly, fluorinated ILs
are strongly interacting with the ZIF-8 framework when compared with
the nonfluorinated IL (i.e., [BMIM][Cl]). These red shifted values
are in good accordance with the calculated Eads values.

2.5 Charge-Transfer Analysis
The adsorption
mechanism of ILs at nanoporous materials and stability of the complexes
depend on the involvement of charged species. Here, we have computed
charge density and partial atomic charges to quantify the charge-transfer
ability of the composite materials. For this analysis, we used optimized
geometries from hybrid formalism. The Löwdin population scheme
has been used to study the charge-transfer analysis between ILs and
the surface. The charge density difference Δρ for the
different IL@ZIF-8 interfaces can be quantified from the following eq 1. 1  Where ρ(ILs@ZIF-8) is the total charge density of the complex and ρ(ILs) and ρ(ZIF-8) are the charge densities of
ILs and ZIF-8 units, respectively. The computed charges are given
in Table 4, and charge
density pictures of all the ILs@ZIF-8 are shown in Figure 6. This charge analysis clearly
shows that there is a significant charge transfer between the fluorinated
ILs into the ZIF-8 surface when compared to nonfluorinated IL (i.e.,
[BMIM][Cl]). These results are in good accordance with the calculated Eads, which is discussed in the previous section.
The net charge of hydrophilic [BMIM][Cl] is +0.04 a.u. and of ZIF-8
is −0.04 a.u. The less charge transfer observed for this complex
can be correlated with the blue shifts observed in the IR spectra.
The respective charges for [BMIM][CF3CO2]@ZIF-8
complex are +0.27 a.u. and – 0.27 a.u. The large charge transfer
shows a strong interaction between the anion and framework, which
is responsible for the large red shift observed in the IR band. Similarly,
hydrophobic ILs also showed a significant difference in the charges
of the IL and ZIF-8 framework (Table 4). The order of magnitude of charge transfer in the
composite different anion is [CF3CO2]− > [PF6]− > [BF4]− > [Cl]−. This confirms that the
involvement of
fluorine atoms in the anion plays a vital role in the stability of
the composite materials and more fluorinated composite, [BMIM][PF6]@ZIF-8, is showing better composite stability in accordance
to both Eads and charge transfer. The
magnitude order is also closely matching with the vibrational redshift
values of ion pair interaction at the confined state.

the charge depletion and accumulation, respectively. The red dotted
circle represents the magnified parts of electron density at the interface.

–0.041	0.041	–0.271	0.271	–0.101	0.101	–0.246	0.246	
Furthermore, we have calculated the total electron
density and
charge density for confirming the interfacial interaction between
the confined ILs and ZIF-8 structure, which is given in Figure 6. It can be seen from the total
electron density plots that there is no contour density between the
ILs and ZIF-8. This clearly indicates that there are only weakly bonded
interactions (i.e., dispersive and vdWs) between ILs and the ZIF-8
cage. To understand the charge accumulation and depletion mechanisms,
we plotted the charge density difference at this interface. These
plots show the charge depletion and accumulation on the anionic part
of the IL and ZIF-8 structure, which indicate the donating and acceptor
properties of the IL anion and ZIF-8, respectively. These plots well
correlate with the calculated atomic charges of the complexes. In
the case of [BMIM][Cl]@ZIF-8, electron density accumulates in the
IL but not in the ZIF-8. From this, we confirmed the long-range dispersive
kind of interaction, which favors the negligible charge transfer in
nonfluorinated ILs. While in fluorinated ILs, the charge density is
mostly localized on the ZIF-8 surface and a very less dispersion in
the anions. The charge-transfer pathway is identified to be from the
C2 carbon of imidazole through the anionic part to the ZIF-8 framework.
From this analysis, we found that there is a significant charge transfer
in fluorinated IL complexes. Thus, we confirmed that the imidazolium-based
fluorinated anionic ILs are more suitable for making the composite
materials with ZIF-8.

3 Conclusions
In this study, we have
analyzed and compared different DFT methods
with and without dispersion correction for the understanding of structural
stability of various ILs at ZIF-8 nanopores. It is found from the
calculations that both the BLYP and PBE methods with the incorporation
of D2 correction in hybrid formalism approaches are more reliably
predicting the structure, stability, IR spectra, and charge-transfer
process at this interface. These interfacial interactions were also
validated by the Gaussian basis approach. Furthermore, the microscopic
analysis of geometries reveals that ILs are highly dispersed and stabilized
at the nanopores of ZIF-8, particularly the ZIF-8 structure is highly
preferable for the hydrophobic ILs. The similar hydrophobicities of
ILs and ZIF-8 (like-like pair) lead to the development of better composites
when compared to the hydrophilic ILs. It is interesting to note that
the involvement of fluorine atom-containing anions (i.e., CF3CO2–, BF4–, and PF6– moieties) plays
a significant role in the charge transfer and stability of the complexes.
Vibrational analysis reveals that there is a significant shift in
frequencies for all the complexes except [BMIM][Cl]@ZIF-8. The larger
red shift value indicates that there is strong adsorption between
fluorinated ILs and ZIF-8. These significant findings are well supported
by the charge density plots of composite materials. The predicted
methodology is helpful to identify suitable DFT methods for the investigation
of IL-based composite materials for various applications such as catalysis,
carbon capture, and separation.

4 Computational Details
The cell optimization
of the ZIF-8 structure was done using the
Quickstep package in CP2K68 version 5.1.
Cell optimization was carried out to optimize both cell vectors and
atomic positions. Optimization helps to find out the minimum energy
and stable confirmation by adjusting the initial lattice parameters.37 For the optimization of composite materials,
we have employed GGA functionals such as Becke–Lee–Yang–Parr
(BLYP)69 and Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE)70 with (D271 and D372) and without dispersion correction.
It is well known that dispersion correction and selection of suitable
DFT methods are very important to study the interface-based materials.46 Without dispersion correction, there is a lack
of energetic discrimination between different topologies. Long-range
dispersive interactions are responsible of the enhanced stability
of dense ZIFs.52 With the D3 dispersion
correction method, we tried two different basis sets, which are TZV2P
and TZVP.73 The hybrid Gaussian plane wave61 (GPW) method is used, which is an efficient
method to treat systems with more accuracy and less computational
cost. For all the atoms, we considered the triple-zeta basis set (TZVP-MOLOPT-SR-GTH)
and double-zeta basis set (DZVP-MOLOPT-GTH) for B and Zn. For all
calculations, we used an auxiliary plane wave cutoff of 450 Ry. Vibrational
frequencies of all the complexes were obtained from the PBE-D2/TZVP
method in the CP2K code.

To validate the structure and stability
of the complexes, we did
additional quantum calculation with the periodic boundary condition
(PBC) module, which is implemented in the Gaussian 16 package.74 This is the first report on the free optimization
of IL@ZIF-8 complexes with the PBC method. Free optimization refers
that there are no atoms fixed during the optimization of complexes.
Here, also we can compare the changes in the unit cell parameters.
This will provide the structural flexibility and expansion of the
pore volume. All geometries and Eads are
obtained from the RPBE75/6-31G level of
theory. RPBE is a revised version of the PBE method, which does not
involve fitting of parameters. Adsorption energies (Eads) of all the composites are calculated using the following eq 2. 2  Here, Ecomposite represents the total energy of the composite material
and EZIF-8 and EILs represent the total
energies of the ZIF-8 and ILs, respectively.
