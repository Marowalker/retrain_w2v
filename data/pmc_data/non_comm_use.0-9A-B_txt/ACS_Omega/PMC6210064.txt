Peripheral nerves have the capacity
to regenerate due to the presence
of neuroprotective glia of the peripheral nervous system, Schwann
cells. Upon peripheral nerve injury, Schwann cells create a permissive
microenvironment for neuronal regrowth by taking up cytotoxic glutamate
and secreting neurotrophic signaling molecules. Impaired peripheral
nerve repair is often caused by a defective Schwann cell response
after injury, and there is a critical need to develop new strategies
to enhance nerve regeneration, especially in organisms with restricted
regenerative potential, such as humans. One approach is to explore
mechanisms in lower organisms, in which nerve repair is much more
efficient. A recent study demonstrated that the antiparasitic drug,
ivermectin, caused hyperinnervation of primordial eye tissue in Xenopus laevis tadpoles. Our study aimed to examine
the role of ivermectin in mammalian nerve repair. We performed in
vitro assays utilizing human induced neural stem cells (hiNSCs) in
co-culture with human dermal fibroblasts (hDFs) and found that ivermectin-treated
hDFs promote hiNSC proliferation and migration. We also characterized
the effects of ivermectin on hDFs and found that ivermectin causes
hDFs to uptake extracellular glutamate, secrete glial cell-derived
neurotrophic factor, develop an elongated bipolar morphology, and
express glial fibrillary acidic protein. Finally, in a corresponding
in vivo model, we found that localized ivermectin treatment in a dermal
wound site induced the upregulation of both glial and neuronal markers
upon healing. Taken together, we demonstrate that ivermectin promotes
peripheral nerve regeneration by inducing fibroblasts to adopt a glia-like
phenotype.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Unlike
the central nervous system, the peripheral nervous system
(PNS) has a substantial capacity for repair upon injury. Although
peripheral nerve repair is relatively efficient, there are instances
in which this process is impaired or even prevented. Approximately
20 million Americans sustain peripheral nerve damage resulting from
medical disorders and/or trauma.1 For example,
neuropathy, a condition that occurs upon peripheral nerve damage or
disruption, often produces pain and/or loss of sensation and movement,
and can result from diabetes, certain autoimmune diseases, human immunodeficiency
virus infection, and chemotherapy treatment. Furthermore, 3–10%
of all traumatic injuries result in acute peripheral nerve damage
requiring surgical intervention.2 Fewer
than half of traumatic injury patients who undergo surgical nerve
repair regain good to excellent motor function and sensation. This
type of irreparable peripheral nerve damage can negatively affect
a patient’s quality of life and may cause severe and permanent
sensory and motor function defects that can result in complete paralysis
or development of chronic neuropathic pain.3 Axonal loss and defective axonal regrowth are responsible for these
critical deficits in peripheral nerve repair, while it has been suggested
that the microenvironment surrounding axons plays an essential role
in this process.

Innate peripheral nerve repair capacity can
be attributed at least
in part to the highly regenerative glial cells of the PNS, the Schwann
cells. Several animal studies have indicated that poor axon regeneration
after peripheral nerve injury is due at least in part to a defective
Schwann cell response.4 Schwann cells myelinate
peripheral nerves and play an essential role in axon guidance and
regeneration. Upon peripheral nerve injury, distal axons degenerate,
whereas resident Schwann cells dedifferentiate, become proliferative,
and help to create a permissive microenvironment for subsequent neuronal
regrowth.5 For example, Schwann cells have
been implicated in the uptake of cytotoxic glutamate upon neuronal
injury.6 Furthermore, Schwann cells also
secrete extracellular signaling molecules to enhance nerve regeneration.
One of the extrinsic factors upregulated by Schwann cells in response
to peripheral nerve injury is glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor
(GDNF).7 GDNF has been shown to promote
neuronal growth and survival and has been widely used in the development
of various therapeutic strategies for experimental nerve repair, such
as diabetic neuropathy8 and sciatic nerve
transection.9 Differentiated Schwann cells
typically exhibit an elongated, bipolar morphology, and begin to upregulate
certain cytoskeletal proteins, including glial fibrillary acidic protein
(GFAP). GFAP appears during the formation of immature Schwann cells
and is downregulated upon myelination.10 Interestingly, GFAP plays a prominent role in peripheral nerve regeneration
specifically, as it was shown that neuronal regrowth after injury
was delayed in GFAP-null mice, which is likely due to deficits in
Schwann cell regulation.11

Strategies
to treat peripheral nerve damage have been developed,
but have a number of limitations. For patients requiring repair of
larger nerve defects and/or traumatic injuries, the primary treatment
is an autologous nerve graft, which has multiple drawbacks, such as
limited availability of sacrificial nerve tissue, donor site morbidity,
and potential neuroma formation.3 Current
treatment for diabetic neuropathy, which is caused by distal nerve
death in the extremities as a result of poor vascularization and high
blood glucose levels, is pain management, which does not treat the
actual nerve damage. There have also been several experimental models
that attempt to improve outcomes of diabetic neuropathy. For example,
a recent study utilized herpes simplex virus vector-mediated gene
transfer of vascular endothelial growth factor for subcutaneous inoculation
in the skin in a mouse model of diabetic neuropathy.12 Although this localized treatment was able to significantly
increase the presence of nerve fibers in the skin, this method of
virally induced gene transfer is not suitable for certain clinical
applications.

Given the various shortcomings of current treatment
options, there
is a critical need to identify novel targets and to develop new strategies
to combat the issue of impaired nerve regeneration. One approach is
to examine mechanisms in lower organisms, in which peripheral nerve
repair is much more robust and efficient. Certain species of salamander,
such as the axolotl, can regenerate entire amputated limbs, including
completely functional neural components with tactile sensation and
motion.13 Many studies have focused on
understanding what makes these amphibians retain such a high regenerative
capacity into adulthood, whereas so many other vertebrate species
do not. Interestingly, denervating the axolotl limb upon amputation
inhibits limb regeneration, suggesting that proper innervation is
crucial not only for restoring nerve function, but also for overall
limb tissue repair.14

Although this
organism has the innate capacity for complete regeneration,
similar species are not as regenerative, but show a much higher capacity
for repair than mammalian systems. For example, the South African
clawed frog Xenopus laevis, can partly
regenerate the tail, spinal cord, and limbs, but not to the same extent
as salamanders, as its regenerative capacity steadily decreases as
the animal matures.15 Understanding mechanisms
by which to enhance the regenerative capacity as these animals transition
from regenerative to nonregenerative can be helpful in devising strategies
for enhancing mammalian repair, especially given the well-established
reduction in regenerative capacity during aging in humans.16 For example, a recent study in a Xenopus host engraftment model demonstrated that ivermectin could enhance
innervation of primordial eye tissue engrafted onto the flanks of
early stage tadpoles.17 Ivermectin is an
established antiparasitic drug that is used widely in both clinical
and veterinary medicines. In humans, ivermectin is used in the treatment
of onchocerciasis, but is also effective against other worm infestations,
such as strongyloidiasis, as well as some parasitic skin diseases,
including scabies.18 At higher doses, ivermectin
has been shown to act as a positive regulator of a variety of ion
channels and receptors, such as glycine19 and purinergic receptors,20 many of which
are also present in mammalian cells. Locally stimulating these ion
channels at the site of nerve damage has the potential to initiate
nerve growth and repair. We hypothesized that this newly identified
method of increasing innervation in nonregenerative stage frogs may
also be useful for inducing innervation in organisms with restricted
regenerative potential, like humans.

The goal of this work was
to assay the effects of ivermectin on
mammalian peripheral nerve repair. To this end, we first developed
a series of in vitro assays utilizing human induced neural stem cells
(hiNSCs).21 Using a three-dimensional (3D)
bilayer collagen gel co-culture system incorporating human dermal
fibroblasts (hDFs) and hiNSCs as a simple in vitro tool for understanding
the complex interactions between these two different cell types, we
found that pretreating hDFs with ivermectin caused adjacent hiNSCs
to significantly increase proliferation. Similarly, in migration assays
using predifferentiated hiNSCs, we found that ivermectin-treated hDFs
caused a significant increase in neuronal migration. We also further
characterized the effects of ivermectin on hDFs in vitro, and found
that ivermectin caused hDFs to uptake extracellular glutamate, secrete
GDNF, develop an elongated bipolar morphology, and express GFAP, suggesting
that ivermectin causes hDFs to adopt a glia-like phenotype. Finally,
we translated our in vitro findings to a relevant in vivo model and
found that localized ivermectin treatment in a dermal wound site induced
the upregulation of both glial and neuronal markers upon healing.
Taken together, our data reveal a novel role for ivermectin in promoting
peripheral nerve regeneration during mammalian wound healing.

2 Results
2.1 Treating Dermal Fibroblasts
with Ivermectin
Induces Proliferation in Co-cultured hiNSCs
We developed
a 3D bilayer collagen gel co-culture system consisting of human induced
neural stem cells (hiNSCs) fluorescently labeled with DiD dye and
human dermal fibroblasts (Figure 1A). These hiNSCs are highly proliferative and express
Sox1, Sox2, and Nestin (Figure S1). Prior
to embedding in separate collagen gels, both cell types were transiently
treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or 1 μM ivermectin and
subsequently washed repeatedly to remove residual drug. hDFs were
seeded into the bottom gel, labeled hiNSCs seeded into the top gel,
and the bilayer constructs were subsequently cultured for 5 days.

in adjacent neural stem cells in 3D co-cultures. (a) Schematic diagram
of experimental design. Human dermal fibroblasts (hDFs) and human
induced neural stem cells (hiNSCs) fluorescently labeled with DiD
dye were separately treated with or without 1 μM ivermectin
(as indicated by “+” or “–”, respectively)
and subsequently washed repeatedly to remove the drug, seeded into
3D bilayer collagen gel constructs, and cultured for 5 days. (b) Low-magnification

Error bars show mean ± SD.

Similar to findings from previous Xenopus experiments
that indicated noncell-autonomous effects on neural growth,17 we observed increased neural growth only in
those constructs, in which hDFs were pretreated with ivermectin (Figure 1B). Upon cryosectioning
these bilayer gels, we found that hiNSCs in these constructs expressed
significantly higher levels of proliferation marker Ki67 (Figure 1C,D), suggesting
that ivermectin-treated hDFs induced proliferation in adjacent hiNSCs
in 3D bilayer co-cultures.

2.2 Ivermectin-Treated Fibroblasts
Induce Migration
of Differentiated Neurons
Having established that ivermectin-treated
hDFs induced proliferation of neural stem cells, we also aimed to
study their potential effects on neuronal migration. To test this,
we seeded hDFs into the bottom transwell of cell culture plates, treated
with DMSO or 1 μM ivermectin, then subsequently washed repeatedly
to remove residual drug (Figure 2A). In the top of the transwell on the coated 8 μM
pore membrane, we seeded DiD-labeled human neurons to minimize the
effect of proliferation in the assay. We utilized hiNSCs that had
been predifferentiated for 1 week that were no longer proliferative
and expressed high levels of pan-neuronal marker β III tubulin
(Tuj1) (Figure S2A). These transwell systems
were cultured in low serum media overnight (to further minimize potential
cell proliferation), and the relative number of cells migrating to
the bottom of transwells was quantified (Figure 2B,C). Interestingly, ivermectin-treated hDFs
demonstrated a significant increase in neuronal migration relative
to control-treated cells.

Figure 2 Treatment of dermal fibroblasts with ivermectin
induces migration
of differentiated neurons. (a) Schematic diagram of experimental design.
Human dermal fibroblasts were seeded into the bottom of cell culture
plates, subsequently treated with or without ivermectin, and washed
repeatedly to remove the drug. Differentiated DiD-labeled neurons
were seeded onto coated transwells (8 μM pore size), which were
placed into the wells containing fibroblasts. Cells were cultured
in low serum media (to minimize potential cell proliferation) overnight,
and the relative number of cells migrating to the bottom of transwells
was quantified. (b) Images of fluorescently labeled neurons that migrated
to the bottom of transwells upon co-culture with dermal fibroblasts

Quantification of migrated cells. *P ≤ 0.05,
**P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤
0.001; as determined by two-tailed t-test. Error
bars show mean ± SD.

Taken together, we demonstrate that ivermectin treatment
of stromal
hDFs, but not hiNSCs, had a profound effect on neural growth. Importantly,
because the drug was washed out extensively prior to establishing
both co-culture models, this suggests that the related effects were
the result of the initial pretreatment of separate cell types and
not the effect of the drug itself on the entire co-culture constructs.

2.3 Treatment with Ivermectin Causes Dermal Fibroblasts
to Adopt Functional Characteristics of Glial Cells
We first
hypothesized that ivermectin-treated fibroblasts were removing potentially
cytotoxic glutamate from the extracellular microenvironment. To test
this, we treated hDFs with various concentrations of ivermectin overnight,
then assayed the cell culture media to determine extracellular glutamate
concentration. It was previously shown that fibroblast cell culture
media contains a large quantity of glutamate as a result of the addition
of l-glutamine, a precursor of glutamate, to many types of
media formulations.22 Interestingly, we
found that treatment of hDFs with ivermectin resulted in a significant
dose-dependent decrease of extracellular glutamate concentration (Figure 3A), suggesting that
ivermectin-treated fibroblasts might also be able to uptake extracellular
glutamate released by neurons upon injury.

Figure 3 Treatment with ivermectin
causes dermal fibroblasts to uptake extracellular
glutamate and to express glial cell line-derived neurotrophic growth
factor (GDNF). (a) Dermal fibroblasts were treated with various concentrations
of ivermectin overnight, and cell culture media was assayed to determine
extracellular glutamate concentration. (b) Dermal fibroblasts were
treated with or without 1 μM ivermectin for 4 days, then subjected
to quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis
for various neurotrophic growth factors. (c) Immunostaining results
of dermal fibroblasts treated with ivermectin show an increase in
GDNF expression with increasing ivermectin concentration, scale bar:
100 μM. (d) Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of cell
culture media harvested from dermal fibroblasts treated with ivermectin
for 4 days indicates that GDNF is secreted from ivermectin-treated
fibroblasts. *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001; as determined
by one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey test. Error bars show mean ±
SD.

We hypothesized that ivermectin
treatment of hDFs was eliciting
some type of paracrine effect on neighboring hiNSCs. As such, we also
aimed to determine whether ivermectin caused fibroblasts to express
any neurotrophic factors. We treated hDFs with vehicle or 1 μM
ivermectin for 4 days, then subjected them to qRT-PCR analysis to
assay for expression of various growth factors. We found that although
there was no significant effect of ivermectin on brain-derived neurotrophic
factor or nerve growth factor after 4 days, ivermectin-treated hDFs
dramatically upregulated expression of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic
factor (GDNF) (Figure 3B), a factor shown to be highly expressed by astrocytes23 and Schwann cells.7 To confirm if GDNF was also upregulated at the protein level, we
treated hDFs with increasing amounts of ivermectin and immunostained
against GDNF, and found that exposure to ≥1 μM ivermectin
increased GDNF expression (Figure 3C). Upon determining that GDNF was upregulated at both
the mRNA and protein level, we also aimed to understand if GDNF was
also being secreted. hDFs were treated with increasing concentrations
of ivermectin for 4 days, and hDF-conditioned media was harvested,
filtered, and subjected to GDNF ELISA. Interestingly, we found that
at concentrations ≥2.5 μM, ivermectin caused hDFs to
secrete significant levels of GDNF protein into the media (Figure 3D). Ivermectin concentrations
≥5 μM appeared to be cytotoxic in vitro (Figure S3).

To further elucidate the role
of ivermectin-induced GDNF expression
in hDFs on co-cultured hiNSCs, we performed neuron migration experiments
(as in Figure 2) in
the presence of an antibody that functionally blocks GDNF, and found
that this antibody was able to diminish the effects of ivermectin-treated
hDFs on hiNSC migration (Figure S4).

2.4 Ivermectin-Treated Fibroblasts Demonstrate
Glia-like Morphology and Upregulate GFAP
Having established
that ivermectin causes hDFs to adopt certain characteristics of glial
cells, including glutamate uptake and release of GDNF, we also aimed
to understand if ivermectin-treated hDFs also become more phenotypically
similar to glia. Similar to previous experiments, hDFs were treated
with increasing concentrations of ivermectin for up to 8 days, then
subjected to qRT-PCR, and immunostaining. We also subjected samples
to GeneQuery Human Schwann Cell Biology qPCR Array Kit and found that
ivermectin-treated hDFs highly express multiple genes implicated in
various aspects of Schwann cell biology, including differentiation
and maintenance, peripheral nerve regeneration, and extracellular
matrix synthesis, including (but not limited to) SRY-box 10 (Sox10),
S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B), myelin basic protein, growth
associated protein 43 (GAP43), and neural cell adhesion molecule 1
(NCAM1) (Figure S5).

Furthermore,
qRT-PCR analysis revealed that hDFs treated with 1 μM ivermectin
expressed significantly higher levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein
(GFAP) at both D4 and D8 (Figure 4A). Similarly, we demonstrated that increasing concentrations
of ivermectin resulted in higher protein expression of GFAP, as well
as morphological changes reminiscent of a Schwann cell-like phenotype,
becoming very thin and elongated relative to control fibroblasts (Figure 4B). Finally, we repeated
several experiments using different formulations of ivermectin to
confirm that the observed effects were the result of the drug and
not a nonspecific artifact of drug synthesis. We found that for all
formulations of ivermectin tested, GFAP was upregulated and the phenotypic
elongated morphology was also observed (Figure S6), suggesting that our findings regarding the effects of
ivermectin on hDFs were likely caused by the principal component of
the drug itself and not by potentially contaminating byproducts of
the manufacturing process.

Figure 4 Treatment of dermal fibroblasts with increasing
concentrations
of ivermectin results in the upregulation of GFAP as well as the development
of an elongated morphology reminiscent of Schwann cells. (a) Dermal
fibroblasts were treated with varying concentrations of ivermectin
for 4 and 8 days, then subjected to qRT-PCR analysis of GFAP expression.
(b) GFAP immunostaining demonstrates that dermal fibroblasts treated
with relatively higher concentrations of ivermectin for 8 days results
in an increase of GFAP expression as well as a change in morphology,
which resembles a Schwann cell-like phenotype, scale bar: 100 μM.

2.5 Effect of Ivermectin in
an in Vivo Model of
Wound Healing
Although our in vitro results clearly demonstrated
a role of ivermectin in promoting nerve regeneration through the transformation
of dermal fibroblasts into a more glial-like phenotype, it was important
to understand if these effects could also be seen in an in vivo model.
After generating compelling data, which suggested that ivermectin-treated
dermal fibroblasts promote the growth of co-cultured neurons, we selected
a physiologically relevant in vivo system that would include both
relevant cell types (dermal fibroblasts and peripheral nerves) and
provide a simplified system for localized drug delivery of ivermectin.
For this purpose, we selected a dermal wound healing model. Two 8
mm diameter full-thickness biopsies were removed from the dorsal skin
of adult male BALB/c mice. In the wound on the right side, 30 μL
collagen gels containing 10 μM ivermectin or DMSO (control)
were pipetted onto the wound and allowed to solidify (Figure 5A). The left side wounds remained
untreated and served as additional controls. Both wounds were sealed
using Tegaderm, and wound progression was followed over the course
of 12 days. We determined that ivermectin partially aided in wound
healing as determined by quantification of wound size over time (Figure 5B). At days 8–9
as well as 11–12, ivermectin-treated wounds were significantly
smaller than DMSO-treated controls.

biopsies in vivo. (a)
Schematic diagram of experimental design. Biopsies (2 × 8 mm2) were taken from the dorsal dermal layer of each mouse. In
the right side wound, 30 μL collagen gels containing 10 μM
ivermectin or DMSO (control) were pipetted onto the wound and allowed
to solidify. The left side wounds remained untreated, and served as
additional controls. Both wounds were sealed using Tegaderm, and wound
progression was followed over the course of 12 days. (b) Images of
gross morphology of wound healing over time. (c) Quantification of
wound size over time. *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01; as determined by two-tailed t-test. Error bars show mean ± SD.

2.6 Healed Ivermectin-Treated Wounds Have Increased
Neuronal and Glial Marker Expression
We next assayed for
the presence of both neuronal and glial markers in the healed dermal
tissue. This is especially important as impaired wound healing often
produces scar tissue, in which nerves fail to regenerate properly,
resulting in loss of sensation at the wound site. Upon sacrifice at
D12, we excised and fixed the wound tissue, subjected tissue sections
to immunostaining, and found significantly higher expression of secreted
factor GDNF (Figure 6A), glial marker GFAP (Figure 6B), and peripheral nerve marker (PGP9.5) (Figure 6C) in those mice treated with
ivermectin-loaded collagen gels as compared to vehicle-control collagen
gels. These findings correspond to our in vitro data to suggest that
ivermectin also promotes nerve growth by inducing the generation of
glia-like cells in an in vivo model of wound healing.

Figure 6 Ivermectin facilitates
wound healing by inducing the differentiation
of glia-like cells that promote nerve growth. Cryosections of the
wound sites were immunostained and quantified to assay for the presence
of (a) glial-derived growth factor (GDNF), (b) glial fibrillary acidic
protein (GFAP), and (c) peripheral nerve marker (PGP9.5), scale bar:
100 μM. *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001; as determined
by two-tailed t-test. Error bars show mean ±
SD.

3 Discussion
Although the peripheral nervous system has an innate repair capacity,
there are various cases, in which this process is impaired, especially
in organisms with restricted regenerative potential, such as humans.
Given the limitations of current treatment options, there is a critical
need to develop new strategies to enhance nerve regeneration. One
approach is to examine mechanisms in lower vertebrates, in which peripheral
nerve repair is quite efficient. The anthelminic drug ivermectin was
recently shown to enhance innervation in regenerative stage frogs.
Previous experiments performed in X. laevis tadpoles demonstrated a role for ivermectin in promoting increased
nerve growth from ectopic eye tissue.17 Fluorescently labeled donor eye primordia or unlabeled host tadpoles
were treated with or without ivermectin before ectopic engraftment
on the host animal flank. Hyperinnervation of the engrafted eye was
only seen in those tadpoles, in which the donor tadpole received ivermectin
pretreatment (and not vice versa).17 These
experiments revealed that ivermectin treatment of non-neuronal stromal
tissue can be exploited to induce the expansion of neurons from the
adjacent engrafted neuronal tissue. Although these results were striking,
it is important to understand whether this phenomenon was specific
to this amphibian model or could be recapitulated in mammalian systems.

In this work, we provide a role for ivermectin in promoting peripheral
nerve growth in mammals. We discovered that co-culturing hiNSCs with
ivermectin-treated fibroblasts resulted in increased hiNSC proliferation
and migration. In addition, we found that ivermectin causes fibroblasts
to adopt a glial-like phenotype; increasing uptake of extracellular
glutamate, expressing neurotrophic factor GDNF, and displaying characteristics
of Schwann cells, including elongated morphology and GFAP expression.
These transformed glial-like cells allow for the expansion of resident
neurons, providing a supportive environment for nerve regeneration.
Furthermore, we demonstrate a physiologically relevant in vivo role
for ivermectin in promoting nerve regeneration using a murine model
of wound healing. Importantly, our results are in accordance with
current findings implicating a critical role for peripheral glia during
mammalian tissue regeneration. It was recently shown that dermal injury
activates peripheral glia in an in vivo model of full-thickness skin
repair. Further, it was demonstrated that depletion of these activated
glia functionally impairs the wound healing process.24 Similarly, transplantation of Schwann cell precursors promoted
digit tip regeneration via localized secretion of paracrine factors
in a murine amputation model25

Given
that FDA-approved Ivermectin is already currently used to
treat a variety of infestations, including scabies, lice, and onchocerciasis,26 its use could be further adapted for clinical
applications in peripheral nerve repair. It is known that ivermectin
eradicates parasitic invertebrates by binding and activating glutamate-gated
chloride channels present only in neurons and muscle cells of these
organisms, ultimately leading to muscle paralysis and death.26 In mammals, these types of glutamate-gated chloride
channels were only thought to be expressed in the brain, and were
thereby protected by the blood–brain barrier: rationale that
has lead to its deemed safety for human use. Indeed, at low levels
comparable to what is used in both clinical and veterinary medicines,
there is essentially no discernible effect on these types of mammalian
brain-specific glutamate-gated chloride channels. It has been shown,
however, that ivermectin at higher concentrations (i.e., micromolar
range) can act as an allosteric modulator of multiple channels, including
the human glycine receptor;19 γ-aminobutyric
acid A (GABAA) receptors from chicken,27 rodents,28 and humans;29 chicken and human α7 nicotinic receptors;30 as well as human purinergic receptors P2X420 and P2X7.31 Many
of these receptors are found in multiple cell types in mammals and
more specifically humans, suggesting that the effects of ivermectin
may be more widespread than initially realized.

Within the microenvironment
of a healing wound, there are multiple
cell types involved in the healing process, many of which are known
to express a number of relevant ion channels. For example, human fibroblasts
have been shown to express many of the aforementioned receptors, such
as glycine,32 GABA,33 purinergic,34 and nicotinic.35 This endogenous expression combined with the
relatively nonspecific binding and functioning of ivermectin on a
variety of different ion channels and receptors makes it somewhat
challenging to identify which specific receptor or receptors ivermectin
is acting upon in our in vitro and in vivo systems. This complexity
of potential interactions of ivermectin with multiple channels and
receptors limits insight into mode of action. However, the findings
here provide compelling evidence for a broader impact of ivermectin,
in both downstream efficacy and potential clinical utility.

Although the effects of ivermectin on neuronal and glial growth
in vivo were quite striking, it is important to acknowledge that the
drug’s effect on wound closure was not as profound. It is accepted
that wound healing in healthy mice is particularly difficult to improve
experimentally,36 and more specifically,
the BALB/c wildtype mice used in this study are known to heal relatively
quickly.37 It will be important to assess
whether this drug can also play a role in improving nerve regeneration
in other models, in which the nerve defect is more profound and/or
impaired. For example, similar experiments could be repeated in various
in vivo models of neuropathy, which is often associated with other
co-morbidities, such as diabetes, autoimmune disorders, and chemotherapy
treatment.38 Ivermectin could also be explored
for its potential use in promoting repair of larger nerve defect models,
such as sciatic nerve resection or spinal cord injury. Furthermore,
because we demonstrate that ivermectin causes fibroblasts to secrete
GDNF, this technique can also be adapted as a method to induce endogenous
localized delivery of GDNF as a potential analgesic39 to promote innervation in ischemic tissue40 or perhaps modified further to develop strategies of GDNF
delivery for treating Parkinson’s disease.41

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Generation
of hiNSCs
hiNSC lines
were generated as previously described.21 Briefly, human neonatal foreskin fibroblasts (a gift from Dr. Jonathan
Garlick, Tufts University) were infected with a lentivirus expressing
reprogramming factors OCT4, KLF4, SOX2, and cMYC in a polycistronic
vector (Addgene #24603, a gift from Jose Cibelli). Concentrated virus
was used in combination with polybrene (Millipore) in fibroblast media
at an MOI of 1–2. Media were ultimately changed to hiNSC media:
knockout (KO) Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 20% KO xeno-free SR, 20 ng/mL recombinant bFGF,
1% Glutamax, 1% antibiotic-antimycotic, and 0.1 mM b-mercaptoethanol, which also contained 1% KO growth-factor cocktail
(GFC) (Invitrogen). Cells were later trypsinized and plated onto mouse
embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder layers previously inactivated by
mitomycin C. hiNSC medium (without KO-GFC) was subsequently changed
every 1–3 days. At day 30 or later, colonies were mechanically
picked and passaged onto freshly mitotically inactivated MEFs. Colonies
were expanded by enzymatically passaging using TrypLE (Invitrogen)
on MEF feeders. Each picked colony represented one hiNSC line.

4.2 Ivermectin Preparation
Various formulations
of ivermectin were purchased from multiple sources, including Sigma-Aldrich
(Natick, MA), Tocris (Minneapolis, MN) or Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor,
MI). For all preparations of the drug, DMSO was used for reconstitution
from its lyophilized form.

4.3 Three-Dimensional Collagen
Gel hiNSC Co-cultures
Human dermal fibroblasts (hDFs) and
hiNSCs were treated with 1
μM ivermectin or 1 μM DMSO (control) for 6 h. hiNSCs were
dissociated and labeled with lipophilic fluorescent dye DiD (Invitrogen)
according to manufacturer’s protocol to monitor their growth
in the collagen gels. Collagen gel mix was made with 68% 1.5×
DMEM (Invitrogen), 30% Rat Tail Collagen I (Corning), and 2.5% 0.8
M NaHCO3. The bottom layer of the collagen gel was seeded
with 104 hDFs/gel in 20 μL gels, pipetted into four
well plates (Nunc), and allowed to partially solidify for 20 min at
37 °C. The top layer was seeded with 104 labeled hiNSCs/gel
in 30 μL gels, pipetted on top of the bottom layer, and allowed
to fully set at 37 °C. Once completely solidified, hiNSC media
were added to wells, and 3D constructs were cultured for 5 days in
hiNSC media without FGF.

4.4 Neuron Migration Assay
hDFs were
seeded into the bottom of cell culture plates, subsequently with 1
μM ivermectin or 1 μM DMSO (control) for 6 h, and washed
repeatedly with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove
residual drug. hiNSCs were predifferentiated on gelatin in low-FGF
media for 1 week prior to seeding. Differentiated neurons labeled
with lipophilic fluorescent dye DiD (Invitrogen) were seeded onto
CELLstart-coated (Invitrogen) transwells (8 μM pore size), which
were placed into the wells containing hDFs. Cells were cultured in
low serum media (to minimize potential cell proliferation) overnight
in the presence or absence of functional blocking antibody goat anti-GDNF
(AF-212-NA, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) at relatively low concentration
of 10 μL/10 mL or high concentration of 100 μL/10 mL,
and the relative number of DiD-labeled neurons migrating to the bottom
of transwells was quantified.

4.5 Glutamate
Uptake Assay
hDFs were
treated with various concentrations of ivermectin or DMSO overnight,
cell culture media was harvested and filtered, then subjected to a
glutamate assay (Sigma) according to manufacturer’s instructions.

4.6 qRT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated using
the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), and cDNA was generated using MLV-reverse
transcriptase (Invitrogen, CA) according to the manufacturers’
instructions. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the iQ5 real-time
PCR detection system (BioRad) and normalized based on housekeeping
gene GAPDH. All primer sequences are listed in Table S1. We also performed GeneQuery Human Schwann Cell Biology
qPCR Array Kit (ScienCell Research Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA) according
to the manufacturers’ instructions.

4.7 GDNF
ELISA
A GDNF ELISA (Promega)
was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions using
cell culture media harvested and filtered from hDFs treated with various
concentrations of ivermectin or DMSO for 4 days.

4.8 Immunostaining
All in vitro cultures
as well as in vivo tissue samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde,
then washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Three-dimensional
collagen gels and excised tissues were cryosectioned prior to immunostaining.
Samples were incubated with blocking buffer: 1× PBS containing
10% goat serum and 0.1% triton X-100. Primary antibodies were added
to blocking buffer and incubated with samples overnight at 4 °C.
The next day, samples were washed several times with 1× PBS,
then incubated with a corresponding fluorescently conjugated secondary
antibody in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature (away from
light). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (Invitrogen). All antibodies
used in this study are listed in Table S2.

4.9 Microscopy
Brightfield and fluorescent
images were obtained using a Keyence BZ-X700 microscope and associated
software. Images of whole mount 3D samples were taken using an Olympus
MVX10 macroscope and associated software.

4.10 In Vivo
Wound Assay
Animal studies
were conducted under approved protocol #M2013–142 at Tufts
University. Eight weeks old male BALB/c mice (Charles River Laboratories)
weighing 20–25 g were first shaved on the back and depilated
with Nair (Carter-Wallace Inc., New York, NY). Mice were then anesthetized
with isoflurane, and an 8 mm biopsy punch was utilized to make two
round, full-thickness excisional wounds. In the right side wound,
30 μL collagen gels containing 10 μM ivermectin or DMSO
(control) were pipetted onto the wound and allowed to solidify. The
left side wounds remained untreated and served as additional controls.
Both wounds were sealed using Tegaderm, and wound progression was
followed over the course of 12 days. Three animals were used per treatment
per experiment. At the conclusion of each study, animals were euthanized
and wound site tissue excised for further analysis.

4.11 Statistics
All data are expressed
as mean ± SD, including at least three independent samples analyzed
per experiment. Statistically significant differences were determined
by two-tailed t-test or one-factor ANOVA with post-hoc
Tukey test using the statistics software SYSTAT12 (Systat). A P-value less than 0.05 was considered significant.
