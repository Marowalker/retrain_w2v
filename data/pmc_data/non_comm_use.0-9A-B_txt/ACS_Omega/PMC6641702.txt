Conventional studies on enzyme kinetics
assume that the substrate
concentration remains constant. However, for catalytic reactions taking
place in intracellular compartments, the substrate molecules are fed
in and out of the compartment and are catalyzed into product molecules
within the compartment. In this work, we use a chemical master equation
approach to study the stochastic kinetics of a single enzyme for different
reaction pathways with one or more intermediate states. We obtain
velocity expressions that deviate from the Michaelis–Menten
expression. We study the coefficient of variation, which is a measure
of the noise strength as a function of the mean substrate concentration
for systems where there is influx or/and outflux of substrate molecules.
Our results show that the noise strength decreases with the increase
in the substrate concentration and finally remains the same when the
substrate is present in abundance.

I Introduction
The
Michaelis–Menten (MM) model for an enzymatic reaction
is given by E + S ⇌ ES → E + P, where substrate S reversibly
binds to free enzyme E to form enzyme–substrate complex ES,
which then dissociates to form the product.1 When the substrate is present in excess, the steady-state rate is
given by 1  where k1, k–1, and k2 are the rate constants of formation of the
ES complex, substrate
release, and product formation, respectively. [E]T is the
total enzyme concentration, [E]T = [E] + [ES] is the total
enzyme concentration, and [S] is the concentration of the substrate.
Recent advances in single-molecule fluorescence microscopy enable
one to study single turnovers of individual enzyme molecules in real
time.2−4 In such single-molecule studies, it has been shown
that the free enzyme, E, and the bound state, ES, undergo transitions
between their different conformers on time scales longer than or comparable
to the time scale of the product formation. The probability density
function (pdf) of the turnover times between successive catalytic
events is obtained from the experimental waiting times, and its first
moment gives the average turnover rate.2 A series of previous theoretical studies have examined the effects
of such conformational fluctuations of the enzyme on the reaction
kinetics.5−8 In all of these studies, it is found that the average rate of the
reaction catalyzed by a single enzyme follows the MM relation as obtained
at the ensemble level. At the single-molecule level, using a chemical
master equation (CME) approach, it has been shown that if the substrate
is present in abundance and if the conformational detailed balance
is satisfied, the dependence of the average rate of the reaction on
the substrate concentration follows a MM form, 1.9,10 This resemblance between the rate equations in the
deterministic and stochastic limits is valid only under the assumption
that the substrate is always in excess. However, in living cells,
the assumption that the substrate is present in abundance may not
be always valid.11 In reality, it is not
possible to have an experimental setup where one can maintain a constant
substrate concentration at the single-molecule level. Recently, Grima
and Leier have used the chemical master equation technique to study
a wide range of enzymatic reaction mechanisms and obtain the average
rate of product formation without including the substrate abundance
assumption.12 It has been shown that the
reaction showing a dependence of the rate of product formation on
the substrate concentration measured during the time when the reaction
is going to complete is a logarithmically corrected MM type of equation.
In this work, we study a more realistic situation; the catalytic activity
of an enzyme is studied in an intracellular environment where substrate
molecules are injected into the cellular compartment, they are catalyzed
to a product, and the product molecules leave the compartment. We
focus on the dependence of the catalytic turnover rate on the average
substrate concentration using the chemical master equation approach
for the probability of the system of being in various states. Because
the substrate fluctuations are taken into account, one must explicitly
include the number of substrate molecules in the probability distribution
required to describe the time evolution of the system. Our model is
exactly solvable in the steady-state limit and demonstrates that in
the case when substrate molecules move across the compartment membrane
in one or both directions there is a deviation in the MM relation.
To study the noise in the system, one can also calculate the higher
moments of the pdf that cannot be obtained from deterministic kinetics.
Thus, the distribution function can yield all of the statistical moments
that provide a statistical measure of the fluctuations present in
the system through a dimensionless quantity known as the coefficient
of variation and defined as 2  where n is the number of
substrate molecules present in the compartment at some definite time
interval. Because the assumption of excess substrate concentration
is not invoked into the system, the noise is proportional to the inverse
of the square root of the mean substrate concentration. Grima has
studied earlier the role of noise in multisubunit enzymes where one
can obtain an expression for protein (substrate) fluctuations by considering
an effective chemical master equation that was solved in the steady
state using the linear noise assumption.13,14 The dependence of the noise strength was studied as a function of
the protein concentration by measuring the coefficient of variation.
The noise strength shows different scaling behaviors at low and high
substrate concentrations depending on the number of binding sites
of the multisubunit enzyme.

In this work, we consider two examples:
an enzymatic reaction with
one intermediate enzyme–substrate complex that corresponds
to a MM mechanism and a reaction scheme with two intermediate enzyme–substrate
complexes. In our earlier studies on enzymatic reaction with one or
more intermediate complexes using a first passage time distribution
formalism, we have shown that velocity expressions remain the same.
However, in all of these studies, the substrate was considered being
always present in excess.15,16 In this work, we consider
a realistic situation where there is an influx and outflux of substrate
molecules into and out of the reaction vessel. In Section II, we discuss these cases.
In what follows in Section III, starting from the chemical master equation for the probability
of the number of product molecules formed and the number of substrate
molecules present in solution at a given time, we obtain an exact
analytic solution of the CME in the steady state to study the effect
of the substrate fluctuations on the velocity equation. From the higher
moments of the probability distribution functions, we study the fluctuations
in the number of substrate molecules by calculating the coefficient
of variation.

II Model
We consider
four examples where a single enzyme catalyzes the formation
of the product in an intercellular environment where substrate molecules
are fed in at a constant rate k0. In the
first two cases, the enzymatic reaction involves a single intermediate
complex, ES (Figure 1a,b). In the former, for simplicity, we assume that there is no export
of substrate molecules out of the compartment. Such unidirectional
transport mechanisms are common inside cells.17 In the latter case, we consider an additional backward reaction
for the substrate outflux in the reaction scheme with an average rate
equal to k0′, as shown in Figure 1b. Next, we consider two reaction schemes
that involve two intermediate complexes, ES1 and ES2, and there is only an influx of substrate molecules or substrate
molecules go in and come out of the compartment. In this theoretical
model, it is assumed that there is no backward transition from the
product molecules. For all of these different models, we describe
the system by P[p, n, J, t], the probability that when
the enzyme is in state J, p molecules
are processed and n substrate molecules are present
in the compartment at time t. The active site of
the enzyme can be vacant (J = 0, free enzyme) or
occupied, i.e., an enzyme–substrate complex is formed (J = 1) such that P[p, n, J = 0, t] = P0[p, n, t] and P[p, n, J = 1, t] = P1[p, n, t]. This probability distribution satisfies a set of nonlinear master
equations for which it is not possible to find an exact analytical
solution. We use the steady-state approximation, which allows us to
write these master equations as a set of reduced distributions that
can be solved for the turnover rate, and also derive the moments of
the distribution.18 We discuss this theoretical
approach in our Results and Discussion section for all of the four
reaction schemes given in Figure 1.

intermediates.

II.I Single-Intermediate
Catalytic Reaction
The chemical master equations for the
probability distributions
can be written in the following form18 3a   3b  where P0[p, n, t] = P[p, n, J = 0, t]
and P1[p, n, t] = P[p, n, J = 1, t].

On
rescaling τ = kt,  and , 3a and 3b can be written as 4a   4b  The
normalization condition ∑p,n(P0[p, n, τ] + P1[p, n, τ]) =
1 is satisfied at all times

The turnover rate is given by 5  As given in Appendix A, we work with the reduced distributions, and the
turnover rate is
given by 6  where z = ϵ1 + ϵ–1.

When ⟨n⟩ + z ≫
2√n, which is true at high substrate concentration
or at large values of z, 6 can
be binomially expanded as  Neglecting the higher-order terms and after
simplification, the above equation reduces to a MM-type relation given
as 7  Thus, at higher
substrate concentrations and
higher values of z (at a given value of ⟨n⟩), the velocity equation behaves as a MM-type equation.
As shown in Figure 2a,b, we compare 6 with the MM relation (7) and different values of z by varying
ϵ1. The difference between the two curves is more
at lower values of ϵ1. Also, at a higher value of z, the two curves come closer at higher substrate concentrations
where the effect of fluctuations is less prominent. Thus, fluctuations
in the substrate concentration are responsible for the strong deviations
from the MM relation.

function

flow at (a) ϵ1 = 2, ϵ–1 =
0.1 and (b) ϵ1 = 10, ϵ–1 =
0.1. The solid line represents the velocity expression obtained from 6, and the dashed line represents the velocity in
the MM limit (7).

The variance of the substrate fluctuations is defined as 8  As shown in Appendix A, the moments μ2(0) and μ2(1) can be calculated
and ⟨n2⟩ is given by 9  and θ
is defined in 6.

9 is then used to calculate the coefficient
of variation, σ, using 2.

For the
catalytic reaction scheme described in Figure 1b with an additional backward
reaction at an average rate equal to k0′, the master
equations are given by 10a   10b  and satisfy the normalization condition ∑p,n(P0[p, n, τ] + P1[p, n, τ]).
As shown in Appendix B, the turnover rate
is given by 11  Thus, the functional form of the turnover
rate equation changes when we include the reverse outflow reaction.
For the velocity function to exist over the entire range of substrate
concentration,  at given value of z and
at a given substrate concentration ⟨n⟩.
In Figure 3a, we plot
the velocity as a function of average substrate concentration. We
show that in the limit when η = 0, 11 reduces
to 6 (the dotted line and the black circles
coincide with each other).

Figure 3 (a) Variation of reaction velocity V as a function
of average number of substrate molecules ⟨n⟩ for the scheme with one intermediate and reversible substrate
flow (influx and outflux). The solid line represents the velocity
expression (11) at ϵ1 = 2,
ϵ–1 = 0.1, and η = 1. The black circles
represent the velocity expression obtained when the limit η
→ 0 is applied to 11, and the dashed
line represents the velocity expression obtained from 6. A comparison of the reaction velocity expression obtained
from 11 (solid line) with that obtained from
the MM equation (13, dashed line) at (b) ϵ1 = 2, ϵ–1 = 0.1, η = 1 and (c)
ϵ1 = 20, ϵ–1 = 0.1, η
= 1.

In the limit when ,
which is true at high substrate concentration
or at large values of z and small values of η
(at a given substrate concentration), 19 can
be binomially expanded, and neglecting the higher-order terms and
simplifying, we get 12  Furthermore, in the limit when z ≫ η, the above equation reduces the velocity expression
in the MM form 13  To take the limit of z ≫
η in 12, we need not take very small values
of η. The effect of adding the condition of substrate export
out of the compartment vanishes when η is very small. Thus,
the condition of z ≫ η can be achieved
by making z significantly higher than the rate of
substrate output out of the compartment. In Figure 3b,c, we compare the velocity expressions
obtained from 11 and 13 at different values of z and η. For higher
values of z (i.e by increasing ϵ1), the velocity expression in 11 agrees with
the MM form (13).

As shown in Appendix B, we also calculate
the second moment of n given by 14  If we put η = 0, 14 reduces to 9. In Figure 4, we compare the coefficients of variation
for the enzyme-catalyzed reactions with and without substrate molecules.
As the concentration of the substrate increases, the noise strength
decreases.

of substrate outflow (dashed line) obtained from 14. Parameter values are ϵ1 = 2, ϵ–1 = 0.1, and η = 1.

II.II Two-Intermediate Catalytic Reaction
We consider an enzymatic reaction where two intermediate enzyme–substrate
complexes are formed before the product is released out of the compartment,
as shown in Figure 1c. Instead of two values of J, one needs to consider
the number of substrate molecules present and number of product molecules
formed in the ES2 state (J = 2) such that P[p, n, J = 2, t] = P2[p, n, t]. With a unidirectional
flow of substrate molecules into the compartment, the master equations
are given by 15a   15b   15c  The normalization condition ∑p,n(P0[p, n, τ] + P1[p, n, τ] + P2[p, n, τ])
= 1 is satisfied at all times, where τ = kt.

The turnover rate is given by 16  As shown in Supporting Information S1, the reaction velocity is given as 17  where  The functional form of the turnover
rate relation
with only the substrate input does not change by including an additional
intermediate state in the catalysis reaction (6).

In the limit, when , carrying out the binomial expansion, we
obtain the velocity expression in the MM form 18  This condition is satisfied either
at a very
high substrate concentration or at high values of ϵ2 and ϵ3 for a given value of ⟨n⟩. This is depicted in Figure 5a,b, where the MM form can be obtained when the velocity
equation, 17, is considered in these limits.

Figure 5 Variation

of average number of substrate molecules ⟨n⟩ for the scheme with two intermediates and irreversible substrate
flow at (a) ϵ2 = 1, ϵ–1 =
0.1, ϵ3 = 5, ϵ–2 = 0.1 and
(b) ϵ2 = 10, ϵ–1 = 0.1, ϵ3 = 20, ϵ–2 = 0.1. The solid line represents
the velocity expression obtained from 17, and
the dashed line represents the velocity in the MM limit (18).

From the different moments obtained in S1, the coefficient of variation can be obtained by 2, where ⟨n2⟩
is
given by 19  where   Constants I, H, C, D, E, L, and J are
defined in S1.

Next, we consider
the same enzymatic reaction as described in Figure 1d with reversible
substrate influx and outflux. The master equations are given by 20a   20b   20c  The normalization
condition ∑p,n(P0[p, n, τ] + P1[p, n, τ] + P2[p, n, τ])
= 1 is satisfied at all times, where τ = kt.

The turnover rate is given by 21  As shown in S1,
the turnover rate is obtained as 22  In the limit
when η → 0, 22 reduces to 17. This is also
shown graphically in Figure 6a.

Figure 6 (a) Variation of reaction velocity V as a function
of average number of substrate molecules ⟨n⟩ for the scheme with two intermediates and reversible substrate
flow (influx and outflux). The solid line represents the velocity
expression (22) at ϵ2 = 3,
ϵ–1 = ϵ–2 = 0.1, ϵ3 = 10, and η = 1. The black circles represent the velocity
expression obtained when the limit η → 0 is applied to 22, and the dashed line represents the velocity expression
obtained from 17. A comparison of the reaction
velocity expression obtained from 22 (solid
line) with that from the MM equation (24, dashed
line) at (b) ϵ2 = 3, ϵ–1 =
ϵ–2 = 0.1, ϵ3 = 10, η
= 1 and (c) ϵ2 = 30, ϵ–1 =
ϵ–2 = 0.1, ϵ3 = 10, η
= 1.

In the limit when  carrying out the binomial expansion, we get 23  In the limit when ϵ2 and
ϵ3 are much higher than η, 23 reduces to a MM form of velocity as shown in Figure 6b,c 24  

As shown in S1, the other moments
of
the distribution are also calculated and the second moment is given
by 25        and the constants are defined
in the Supporting Information.

Similar
to Figure 4, in Figure 7, we
plot σ as a function of the mean substrate concentration for
the two-intermediate enzyme-catalyzed reaction in the absence and
presence of substrate outflux. The fluctuations decrease with the
increase in substrate molecules. This implies that at high substrate
concentrations the removal of substrate molecules during the catalytic
reaction decreases and substrate is present in excess within the compartment.
Also, the outflux rate is small and does not change during the course
of the reaction. As a result, the size of the fluctuations remains
constant with the increasing substrate concentration.

substrate outflow (dashed line) obtained from 25. Parameter values are ϵ2 = 3, ϵ–1 = ϵ–2 = 0.1, ϵ3 = 10, and
η = 1.

III Conclusions
In this work, we study the role of noise in enzymatic reactions
that take place in intracellular environments. The stochastic description
of the system is obtained by solving the chemical master equation
under the steady-state approximation. Our results show that irrespective
of the number of intermediates present in the reaction scheme, substrate
fluctuations can lead to deviation from the classical MM equation.
This is in contrast to previously reported enzyme reactions where
the MM-type relation is followed even at the single-molecule level
under the substrate abundance assumption. The velocity expressions
have a different functional form when there is a unidirectional or
bidirectional transport of substrate molecules into the intracellular
compartment. Thus, the effect of the substrate fluctuations on the
catalytic turnover rate also depends on the manner in which substrate
molecules are injected into the compartment. For unidirectional as
well as bidirectional transport, the velocity equation cannot distinguish
between single- and multiple-intermediate states. At high substrate
concentration, all of these velocity equations reduce to the classical
MM-type equation. We also study the fluctuations in the substrate
concentration by measuring the coefficient of variation, σ.
For a catalytic reaction with one intermediate or more intermediate
states, σ decreases with the increase in the mean substrate
number and reaches a constant value at high substrate concentrations.
Also, the fluctuations are larger in the presence of both substrate
influx and outflux at low substrate concentrations as compared to
those in reactions where there is only unidirectional flow of the
substrate into the compartment (Figures 5 and 7). Thus, noise
plays an important role in cellular compartments in which there are
often a small number of substrate molecules involved in the catalytic
reaction. As shown in Figure S1, we have
compared the noise for the models with one- and two-intermediate states.
For both the models, the noise level decreases as we move from low
to moderate substrate concentrations. At high substrate number, σ
remains the same with an increase in the mean substrate concentration.
At high substrate concentration, when most of the enzyme is in the
substrate-bound state, the presence of slow fluctuations between the
two enzyme–substrate conformers leads to higher noise levels
in the two-state model. Our theoretical results go beyond those of
single-molecule enzymatic experiments where it is assumed that the
substrate is always present in abundance.
