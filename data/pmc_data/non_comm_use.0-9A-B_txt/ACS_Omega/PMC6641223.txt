A computational
study of the formation of secondary ozonide (SOZ)
from the Criegee intermediates (CIs) of sabinene, including hydration
reactions with H2O and 2H2O, was performed.
All of the geometries were optimized at the B3LYP and M06-2X with
several basis sets. Further single-point energy calculation at the
CCSD(T) was performed. Two major pathways of SOZ formation suggest
that it is mainly formed from the sabinene CI and formaldehyde rather
than sabina ketone and formaldehyde-oxide. However, in both pathways,
the activation energies are within a range of ±5 kJ mol–1. Furthermore, the hydration reactions of the anti-CI with H2O and 2H2O showed that the role of the second water
molecule is a mediator (catalyst) in this reaction. The dimer hydration
reaction has lower activation energies than the monomer by 60 and
69 kJ mol–1, at the M06-2X/6-31G(d) and CCSD(T)+CF
levels of the theory, respectively. A novel water-mediated vinyl hydroperoxide
(VHP) channel from both the monomer and dimer has been investigated.
The results indicate that the direct nonmediated VHP formation and
dissociation is interestingly more possible than the water-mediated
VHP. The density functional theory calculations show that the monomer
is faster than the dimer by roughly 22 kJ mol–1.
Further, the infrared spectrum of sabina ketone was calculated at
B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p); the calculated carbonyl stretching of 1727 cm–1 is in agreement with the experimental range of 1700–1800
cm–1.

1 Introduction
A great
variety of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs)
is continuously emitted into the earth’s atmosphere. They mostly
include isoprene, methylbutenol, and monoterpenes that cover α-pinene,
β-pinene, limonene, and sabinene. These compounds are emitted
from natural plants, for example, they are emitted from lemon, lavender,
and thyme and present in fruits, blossoms, leaves, citrus fruits,
and vegetables. Emission rates of BVOCs are estimated to be 1014 g/year.1,2 Globally, within such high emission
rates, the biogenic largely exceeds the anthropogenic sources by a
factor of 10, which is dominated by isoprene, oxygenated compounds,
and monoterpenes.3,4

Sabinene is a bicyclic monoterpene
composed of an exocyclic double
bond. It contains a C=C bond with the familiar stereoisomers
of [1R,5R] and [1S,5S]. Our recent study of the ozonolysis of sabinene
included only the [1R,5R] stereoisomer5 because of the fact that monoterpenes with stereoisomers mostly
have similar energy profiles for ozonolysis reactions. The sabinene
concentration ranges from ppt to ppb in the atmosphere,6 mainly in the tropospheric level. The emission
of this compound is commonly recognized from European beech,7 silver birch,8 and
evergreen holm oak.9 Emission of BVOCs
along with their chemical fate plays a significant role in the atmosphere
quality,10−13 and this is due to the fact that their removal occurs through oxidation
reactions with OH-radicals during the day, NO3-radicals
overnight, and O3. These oxygenating reactions account
for a significant low vapor pressure compounds that involve forming
the so-called secondary organic aerosol (SOA).13−17 This, in turn, affects climate, air quality, environment,
and human health.

The ozonolysis (ozone addition) reactions
are particularly interesting
because of their abundance and the importance of their products to
the fate of the atmosphere.12,16 These reactions are
suggested to occur according to the Criegee mechanism.18 The mechanism is initiated through the 1,3-cycloaddition
of ozone to the double bond of the compound, forming a five-membered
ring known as primary ozonide (POZ).19−21 The POZ decomposes swiftly,
which leads to the formation of a carbonyl oxide recognized as the
Criegee intermediate (CI) and a carbonyl compound depending on the
structure of the monoterpene. Collisions of the CI with nonreactive
species in the atmosphere leads to its stabilization, corresponding
to stabilized CI. The CI subsequently undergoes either unimolecular
or bimolecular reactions. In unimolecular reactions, the CI passes
through the vinyl hydroperoxide (VHP) channel via 1,4-proton transfer
or the dioxirane ester pathway via cyclization.22−25 Furthermore, the bimolecular
reactions of the CI with the carbonyl compound produced from the POZ
decomposition lead to the formation of a secondary ozonide (SOZ);
see Figure 1.23,26 Another main bimolecular channel occurs via reaction with other
atmospheric species, that is, CO,27 O3,28−30 NO,22,31,32 SO2,31,33 and H2O and its clusters.34−38 To assess the effects of CIs on the atmosphere, it is vital to increase
our understanding of these reaction mechanisms. For a full overview
of the ozonolysis reactions, mechanisms, CI orientations, and theoretical
levels used, we refer the reader to our recent review of monoterpenes.39

Figure 1 SOZ formation and hydration of the anti-CI of sabinene.
(I: intermediate,
P: product).

Previous computational
studies of several CIs of small alkenes
reacting with H2O and 2H2O have been reported
in the literature.34−36 Further reactions of CIs of β-pinene and limonene
have also been investigated, with different orientations, that is,
syn-CI and anti-CI.37,38 However, the SOZ formation from
CIs of monoterpenes has only been studied in a few cases.23,40 Furthermore, the lifetimes of small CIs are rather short and cannot
be significantly stabilized. Therefore, the SOZs of monoterpenes that
result from the reaction of the CI with formaldehyde are more important
since they can be stabilized under 298 K and 1 atm because of their
higher abundance.2,7 For a mechanistic view of this
study, see Figure 1.

To the best of our knowledge, the SOZ that results from the
ozonolysis
of sabinene along with the hydration reactions of the corresponding
CI has not been investigated. Therefore, a detailed computational
study of these reaction mechanisms and activation energies at different
levels of theory has been performed to shed more light on their chemistry.
The main objective is to elucidate the reaction mechanisms and identify
the chemical products that result in high yields. Furthermore, this
study will shed more light on different bimolecular reactions of the
CI, that is, SOZ and α-hydroxy hydroperoxide formation, and
will also increase our understanding of the hydration reactions of
different mechanisms to provide more insights to atmospheric chemistry.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Infrared Spectrum of Sabina
Ketone
Although the experimental detection of the products
that result from
the ozonolysis of sabinene can be difficult, the Fourier-transform
infrared (IR) spectrum of the dominant product, sabina ketone, has
been reported.12,41,42 The spectrum reported by Chiappini et al.42 is the first to be reported using a synthesized standard. The main
absorption band ranges from 1700 to 1800 cm–1. Therefore,
the main interest is to provide more insight into the main absorption
band of sabina ketone; that is, the carbonyl group stretching. However,
there is a range of 100 cm–1; hence, our focus is
on getting a closer frequency view of the carbonyl stretching.

The total number of vibrational modes are 66. The calculated IR spectrum
of sabina ketone is depicted in Figure 2, where the term epsilon exemplifies the coefficient
of molar absorbance. Three weak absorption peaks with frequencies
in the range of 2906–3099 cm–1 refer to the
symmetric and asymmetric stretching of CH, CH2, and CH3 groups. A sharp and strong peak with a frequency of 1727
cm–1 corresponds to the carbonyl group (C=O)
stretching. Thus, the calculated C=O frequency is in agreement
with the experimental range. Moreover, another peak with a frequency
value of 1158 cm–1 is conformable with the asymmetric
vibration of the C=O group toward the adjacent CH and CH2 groups; this is in close agreement with the experimental
frequency range of 1100–1150 cm–1.42

2.2 Formation of the SOZ (Pathways
A1 and A2)
In a recent study,5 we investigated
the dissociation of the POZ that results from the ozonolysis of sabinene
into a syn-CI or anti-CI and formaldehyde. The calculation at different
levels of theory showed that the formation of anti-CI and formaldehyde
is more plausible with activation energies ranging from 6 kJ mol–1 to barrierless. The formation of the SOZ from the
resulting products of the POZ dissociation is also studied. This is
due to the importance of SOZ, in which it leads to the formation of
SOA through nucleation and condensation of the SOZ resulting products.
The reaction begins with either the sabinene CI and formaldehyde (Figure 3) or the sabina ketone
and the CI (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). In general, it proceeds from compounds that exhibit an oxygen
moiety for the SOZ formation. Two main pathways, A1 and A2, were studied
at different levels of theory. The reacting complex has been located
in different conformers, and the lowest energy conformer has been
selected as the main reacting complex (RA1).

Figure 3 Optimized geometries
for SOZ formation at B3LYP/6-311G(3df,3pd)
for pathway A1.

Because of the enhanced
stability of the anti-CI of sabinene (RA1) relative to
the syn-CI, it is considered to be the main
source of the SOZ.5,23,24 The reaction proceeds through a bimolecular complex of the formed
CI and the carbonyl compound that results from dissociation of the
POZ from ozonolysis of sabinene.23,39 Both pathways,
A1 and A2, lead to the same product (PA1), occurring
via transition states TSA1 and TSA2. Pathway
A1 involves the reaction of the sabinene CI with formaldehyde, whereas
pathway A2 involves the reaction of the sabina ketone with formaldehyde
oxide (CI). It must be noted that pathway A1 is mainly discussed herein
because of the similarities in reaction mechanisms of A1 and A2. This
is also based on the activation energies, where the difference is
no more than 5 kJ mol–1 of both pathways at different
levels of theory (Table 1). Table 1 shows the
activation energies of both pathways at various levels of theory.
The potential energy surface (PES) of pathway A1 is given in Figure 4, while the PES and
optimized geometries of pathway A2 are provided in the Supporting Information (Figures S1 and S2, respectively),
in which the PESs show the high exothermicity of the reactions. Figure 3 shows that through TSA1, the sabinene CI approaches the formaldehyde by a nucleophilic
addition with C–O bonds of 1.903 and 2.258 Å, forming
the SOZ (PA1) adduct. The bond distances of TSA2 (Figure S1) between the C and O atoms
in the sabina ketone and the CI amount to 2.299 and 2.033 Å,
respectively. The described bond distances are significant in the
determination of other SOZs recognized as cyclic adducts in the nucleophilic
reaction of SO2 and NO2 with different CIs in
the troposphere.39

levels of theory.

The activation
energy values of TSA1 and TSA2 at CCSD(T)+CF
are comparable, with values of 6 and 8 kJ mol–1,
respectively. Furthermore, the energies of TSA1 and TSA2 at B3LYP/6-311G(3df,3pd) are slightly
close, with values of 15 and 18 kJ mol–1, respectively.
The activation energies for both pathways are within a range of approximately
3 kJ mol–1 at the B3LYP/6-31G(d), B3LYP/6-31+G(d),
and M06-2X/6-31G(d) levels of theory. Hence, the CCSD(T)+CF results
are more favorable compared to the density functional theory (DFT).
Moreover, the activation energy value of TSA1 is lower
than the energy reported for the SOZ formation from the syn-CI of
substituted cyclohexenes, where its value is 21 kJ mol–1 at B3LYP/6-31G(d).40 This is explained
according to the steric hindrance and tethering of the compounds,
in which the steric factor increases with the branching and the presence
of various functional groups to the compound. The plausibility of
the selected reactions is based on the calculated energy barriers;
herein, pathways with the lowest energy barriers are selected as more
favored. Furthermore, the low activation energies at different levels
of theory explain and demonstrate the high reactivity of the SOZ formation.
The SOA formation could also be affected on the basis of additional
reactions of SOZ with multiple prevalent atmospheric species, i.e.,
H2O and NH3; determining their nucleation fate.
The reaction of SOZ with H2O or NH3 could be
initiated by a concerted or step-wise nucleophilic addition, leading
to ring opening and simultaneous hydrogen transfer to one of the oxygens
in SOZ. This leads to the formation of different harmful chemical
compounds of organic acids, amines, nitriles, and amides.

2.3 Bimolecular Reaction of the Anti-CI with H2O PES
(Pathway B1)
The hydration reactions of the
CI with nH2O (n = 1,
2, 3, ..., 6) are considered the main and dominant reactions in the
atmosphere because of the ubiquitous concentrations of H2O. Herein, the reaction is studied by the interaction of anti-CI
of sabinene with H2O and 2H2O. Previous studies
suggest that the anti-CI of monoterpenes is more stable than the syn-CI
by no more than 4 kJ mol–1,5,23,32,39,43 in which the terminal oxygen of the syn-CI and anti-CI
is oriented toward and opposite the bicyclic ring, respectively. Our
recent ozonolysis study of sabinene investigated the orientations
and activation energies of the CIs using DFT and ab initio methods,
confirming the different chemistries of the CIs by the VHP and ester
channels.5 It should be mentioned that
pathways with the lowest calculated energy barriers are selected to
be the most likely mechanism to occur in an atmospheric gas-phase
reaction. However, there is still a possibility that the resulting
product with a higher energy barrier will be formed or will contribute
to the formation of other species. Moreover, this applies to the upcoming
pathways of B2, C1, and C2. This is because other predominant atmospheric
species, such as CO2, NO2, and SO2 might act as catalysts in the reactions and decrease the energy
barriers, partially or significantly.

The reaction of anti-CI
with H2O (pathway B1) is initiated by the formation of
α-hydroxy hydroperoxide intermediates (I1B1 and I2B1) in TS1B1. TS1B1 involves the
transfer of a hydrogen atom from H2O to the terminal oxygen
of the CI. This is accompanied by a simultaneous nucleophilic addition
of the OH group of H2O to the carbonyl carbon of the CI.
This leads to delocalization of the positive charge on the central
oxygen atom and hence forms α-hydroxy hydroperoxide (I1B1 and I1B2); see Figure 5. There are considerable changes in the important bond
lengths of TS1B1. Particularly, the bond length of the
terminal O atom of the CI decreases by 0.490–1.288 Å.
Also, the hydroxyl group in the H2O molecule decreases
by 1.127–2.052 Å. This is followed by an increase of 0.182
Å in the bond length of the OH group in the H2O.

Figure 5 Optimized
geometries for the reaction of anti-CI with H2O at B3LYP/6-311G(3df,3pd)
for pathway B1.

Notably, the DFT results
show that the formed intermediates (I1B1 and I2B1) are both conformers with corresponding
energies. However, the conformers differ by 11 kJ mol–1 at CCSD(T)+CF (Figure 5). Moreover, there is a difference in the torsion angle of the OH
groups in the formed intermediates, where the first is similar to
a cis isomer while the second is similar to a trans one. In the second
TS (TS2B1), the decomposition of α-hydroxy hydroperoxide
occurs in a concerted step through dissociation of the O–OH
group, where the bond is elongated from the molecule by 0.561–2.005
Å. This is followed by a simultaneous hydrogen transfer from
the OH to the O–OH group. The bond length of the OH dissociation
increases by 0.177 Å, while decreasing to 1.323 Å for the
O–OH group. Furthermore, the C–O bond decreases by 0.1
Å to form a carbonyl group. This concerted step leads to the
formation of sabina ketone and atmospheric hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) products (PB1); see Figure 5.

Table 2 shows the
barriers obtained at several theoretical levels. The activation energy
of TS1B1 at CCSD(T)+CF is 48 kJ mol–1, which is similar to the one obtained at B3LYP/6-31G(d). The addition
of a diffuse function to B3LYP/6-31G(d) increases the activation energy
by 16 kJ mol–1 for TS1B1, whereas the
addition of a polarization function leads to the same activation energy.
Furthermore, increasing the size of the basis set of the B3LYP method
leads to a slightly higher energy of 58 kJ mol–1. However, the lower energy value of 40 kJ mol–1 is obtained at the M06-2X/6-31G(d) level of theory (Table 2). The reaction of the syn-CI
of limonene with H2O, higher barriers of 62, 65, and 69
kJ mol–1 were determined at CCSD(T)+CF.37 Moreover, the reaction of the anti-CI of β-pinene
(with different orientations) and H2O was reported with
energy values of 51, 61, and 69 kJ mol–1 at M06-2X/6-311+G(2d,p).38 It is worth mentioning that the TS with the
lowest energy value (51 kJ mol–1) is comparable
not only with the CCSD(T)+CF energy but also with its orientation;
in which it is similar to TS1B1 along with the optimized
structure of the α-hydroxy hydroperoxide formed.

The overall
activation energy (relative activation energies of
the highest energy transition state in reference to the initial reactant)
of TS2B1 at the CCSD(T)+CF is 73 kJ mol–1. The B3LYP results utilizing the 6-31+G(d) and 6-311G(3df,3pd) basis
sets are in agreement with CCSD(T)+CF with respective values of 70
and 64 kJ mol–1. However, lower overall activation
energies are obtained with respective values of 52 kJ mol–1 at M06-2X/6-31G(d) and 54 kJ mol–1 at B3LYP/6-31G(d);
see Table 2. In a relative
comparison, the activation energies of the syn-CI of limonene with
H2O are significantly higher with values of 178, 179, and
220 kJ mol–1 at CCSD(T)+CF. This could be attributed
to the steric factor of the limonene and the orientation of the CI
compound along with its stability. However, for a comparable view
of theoretical levels used for pathways B1 and B2; the PES for each
pathway is given in Figures S3 and 6.

Figure 6 PES for the reaction of anti-CI with H2O (pathway
B1).
Energies calculated at different levels of theory.

According to the activation energies in Table 2, M06-2X/6-31G(d),
in agreement with the
B3LYP/6-31G(d), is the most reliable method in terms of computational
cost for this reaction. This is consistent with the hydration reactions
of the anti-CI of β-pinene.38 However,
in the hydration reactions in anti-CI of β-pinene, the authors
did not consider the dissociation of α-hydroxy hydroperoxide
into further reaction mechanisms. Therefore, the M06-2X method might
be debatable in the overall step for upcoming reactions, and this
is observed and discussed in the next reaction with 2H2O.

2.4 Trimolecular Reaction of the Anti-CI with
2H2O PES (Pathway B2)
The reaction of the anti-CI
with 2H2O, pathway B2, along with the effect of water on
the barrier, whether it acts as a mediator or a spectator, has been
included. The mechanism of the 2H2O addition to the anti-CI
is analogous to the mechanism in pathway B1. The corresponding H2O dimer plays a significant role in the reaction behaving
as a mediator (Figure 7). The second H2O molecule transfers one of the hydrogen
atoms from the original H2O molecule to the terminal O
atom of the CI. This step is accompanied by a simultaneous nucleophilic
addition of the OH group of the original H2O molecule to
the carbonyl group of the CI. Hence, the positive charge on the central
O atom of the CI is delocalized, and α-hydroxy hydroperoxide
and H2O are formed (I1B2 and I2B2). The intermediates are formed through a concerted water-catalyzed
transition state defined as TS1B2. Different conformational
changes led to locating the lowest energy conformers of I1B2 and I2B2 that proceed the reaction to the desired products. Figure 7 shows that the bond
lengths of TS1B2 are slightly similar compared to the
lengths in the first step of pathway B1 (TS1B1). Furthermore,
the bond length of H–OH (OH group is in the second H2O molecule) decreases from 1.781 to 1.318 Å. Followed by an
elongation of 0.194 Å in the other hydrogen bond that is being
transferred to the terminal O atom, forming I1B2 and I2B2. The intermediates are both conformers with energies
differing by no more than 4 kJ mol–1; see Figure
S5 in the Supporting Information. Moreover,
there is a difference in the torsion angle of the OH groups and orientation
of H2O; see Figure 7.

Figure 7 Optimized geometries for the reaction of anti-CI with 2H2O at B3LYP/6-311G(3df,3pd) for pathway B2.

In the last step, the second intermediate (I2B2) decomposes
through TS2B2 to form the sabina ketone, H2O2, and H2O (PB2). The O–OH
group is dissociated from α-hydroxy hydroperoxide, and hence,
the bond is elongated from the molecule by 0.408–1.850 Å.
Simultaneously, the hydrogen is transferred from the terminal OH to
the O–OH group through the H2O molecule. Therefore,
the H2O molecule acts as a catalyst, and the whole reaction
mechanism is water-mediated. Furthermore, the bond length of the hydrogen
dissociation from the OH group increases by 0.309 Å, while it
decreases to 1.169 Å to reach the H2O molecule. Likewise,
the mediator transfers the hydrogen to the O–OH group, producing
the sabina ketone, H2O2, and H2O
products (PB2); see Figure 7.

The activation energies of the reaction
of anti-CI with water dimer
2H2O are lower than those of the anti-CI with H2O monomer; see Tables 2 and 3. The activation energy of TS1B2 at CCSD(T)+CF and B3LYP/6-311G(3df,3pd) is the same with an energy
value of 50 kJ mol–1. The energy calculated at B3LYP/6-31+G(d)
is in agreement with CCSD(T)+CF and B3LYP/6-311G(3df,3pd) with a value
of 53 kJ mol–1. However, results of B3LYP/6-31G(d),
B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p), and M06-2X/6-31G(d) are lower with values of 36,
37, and 30 kJ mol–1 (Table 3). Thus, the lowest activation energy values
for the hydration reactions of the anti-CI of sabinene for TS1B1 and TS1B2 are calculated at M06-2X/6-31G(d). This is
consistent with the hydration reactions of the syn-CI and anti-CI
of β-pinene.38 Lin et al.38 reported eight TSs with different orientations
for the reaction of the anti-CI of β-pinene with 2H2O, in which the energy barriers were calculated in the range of 33–40
kJ mol–1 at M06-2X/6-311+G(2d,p). These barriers
are in good agreement with this study at B3LYP/6-31G(d), B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p),
and M06-2X/6-31G(d). It should be noted that upon consideration of
the dissociation of α-hydroxy hydroperoxide into further reactions,
the M06-2X method may not be considerably reliable in the overall
step for upcoming reactions. To our knowledge, there are no previous
monoterpene studies in the literature that represent the dissociation
of α-hydroxy hydroperoxide resulting from the CI reaction with nH2O (n = 1, 2, 3, ..., 6).

The overall activation energy is interestingly low at CCSD(T)+CF
with a value of 3 kJ mol–1. The B3LYP results utilizing
6-31G(d), 6-311G(3df,3pd), and 6-31G+(d) are higher with respective
overall energy values of 12, 34, and 41 kJ mol–1. Thus, the addition of diffuse and polarized functions increase
the energy values sufficiently, compared to the B3LYP/6-31G(d). M06-2X/6-31G(d)
describes the dissociation in the final products as an unreliable
one with an overall energy of −8 kJ mol–1, compared to the positive barriers at the other levels of theory
in Table 3. This is
also observed at MP2/6-31G(d), where the overall activation energy
is −4 kJ mol–1.

To provide more insight
on the hydration reactions of the CIs,
the role of the second H2O molecule, where it acts as a
spectator in the reaction with the anti-CI, has been investigated
utilizing B3LYP/6-31G(d). The activation energy of the TS1B2 value of 59 kJ mol–1 is higher than the reaction
as a mediator by 23 kJ mol–1; see Figure S4 in the Supporting Information. In a comparison of the
mediator and the spectator, the barrier of TS2B2 where
the H2O acts a spectator is overestimated with a value
of 147 kJ mol–1, where the overall energy is 61
kJ mol–1; see Table 3. Hence, the water-mediated reaction is more favorable
with a lower barrier than the spectator one. This might be attributed
to the number of hydrogen bonds formed in the reaction. This is consistent
with our previous work where the barriers drop significantly for the
water-mediated reactions.44−50 Furthermore, the presence of a second H2O molecule increases
the electronegativity with the contribution of the lone pair of electrons
with the hydrogen atom mediation.

2.5 Water-Mediated
(H2O and 2H2O) VHP Channel PES (Pathways C1
and C2)
The reaction
of anti-CI with nH2O (n = 1, 2, 3, ..., 6) is initiated through 1,4-proton transfer via
the mediation of the proton in the H2O molecule. The VHP
channel has been investigated in our recent study,5 through the direct 1,4-proton transfer for the syn-CI and
anti-CI to the final radical products. However, this channel must
be given more attention because of the fact that it leads to the formation
of sabina ketone and OH radicals. Therefore, the radicals’
formation will be investigated through a mediated mechanistic pathway.
It should be noted that the H2O dimer (pathway C2) was
determined by configuring a multiple number of geometries; the lowest
energy conformer has been selected as the main source of the reaction.
The reaction is based on the mechanism of the 1,4-proton transfer,
where this reaction is H2O-mediated. The VHP channel is
usually associated with the unimolecular dissociation, whereas herein,
the reaction is categorized as a bimolecular one with H2O and trimolecular with 2H2O molecules. Both the H2O monomer (Figure 8) and its 2H2O dimer (Figure S5 in the Supporting Information) were studied. However,
the main focus of this discussion will be on the monomer because of
its higher plausibility and lower activation energies. It should be
noted that the reaction mechanisms of both pathways agree with each
other in terms of bond lengths.

Figure 8 Optimized geometries for the VHP channel
via the H2O
molecule at B3LYP/6-311G(3df,3pd) for pathway C1.

In general, the reaction occurs by the dissociation of the
anti-CI
through the proton transfer from the methylene (CH2) group
to the terminal oxygen of the CI via the H2O molecule;
see Figures 7 and S5
(in the Supporting Information). This step
is connected by the VHP (I1C1) formation through TS1C1 via a seven-membered ring, followed by a significant
conformational change to the second VHP (I2C1). Figure 8 shows the change
in bond lengths and torsion angles of the reaction. TS1C1 depicts the change in the bond length of the C–H bond in
the CH2 group from 1.088 to 1.290 Å, while the distance
of the proton reaching the H2O molecule decreases by 0.981–1.369
Å. As a mediator, the H2O molecule transfers a proton
to the terminal oxygen of the CI. The bond length of this proton increases
from 0.985 to 1.243 Å with a simultaneous decrease in the bond
length of the proton reaching the O atom to 1.191 Å. In the sequence
of this mechanism, the carbonyl group of the CI changes its chemistry
by a tautomerization step, leading to the VHP formation. The conformational
change is confirmed by the fact that there is a change in the torsion
angle between the methine (CH) group and the hydrogen of the terminal
OH group. The conformations differ by no more than 30 and 7 kJ mol–1 for pathways C1 and C2, respectively, at different
levels of theory (Figure 9). The bond lengths of structures in pathway C2 are in agreement
with pathway C1; see Figures 7 and S5 in the Supporting Information. The significant difference is in the nine-membered ring transition
state of pathway C2 (TS1C2). The relative energies of
pathways C1 and C2 are given in Figures 9 and S6 in the Supporting Information.

Figure 9 PES for the VHP channel via the H2O molecule
(pathway
C1). Energies calculated at different levels of theory.

The second transition state (TS2C1) involves the dissociation
of the OH group from the VHP, which includes a retro tautomerization
of the C=C bond to become a carbonyl group. This leads to the
radicals’ formation of sabina ketone and OH. The considerable
change in bond lengths is mainly in the OH dissociation, in which
the bond is elongated from 1.471 to 2.081 Å. Moreover, the C=C
bond is elongated by 0.100–1.435 Å in the final product,
while the C=O group is formed by the constriction of the bond
from 1.369 Å in I2C1 to 1.234 Å in PC1. This channel corresponds with only one fate of the CI, that is,
the radicals’ formation. The optimized structures along with
selective bond lengths are given in Figure 8, at B3LYP/6-311G(3df,3pd). The bond lengths
at B3LYP/6-311G(3df,3pd) are in agreement with the bond lengths of
sabinene, limonene, α-pinene, and β-pinene CIs at the
B3LYP/6-31G(d) and B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) levels of theory.5,22,24,37

The accessibility of the activation energies is mostly dependent
on the overall energy. CCSD(T) affords a barrier that significantly
overshoots the barrier of the M06-2X method. Bearing in mind that
these reactions occur in the atmosphere, the likelihood of a lower
barrier is more plausible. Hence, it follows that M06-2X gives a more
realistic description than the more expensive CCSD(T) method. However,
CCSD(T)/6-31G(d) proved to be significant in the case of this pathway
(Figure 9). Table 4 shows that lower
overall activation energies for the anti-CI with the H2O monomer (pathway C1) are obtained at different levels of theory.
For example, the overall barrier for pathway C1 at B3LYP/6-31G(d),
B3LYP/6-311G(3df,3pd), and B3LYP/6-31+G(d) is lower by 6, 22, and
18 kJ mol–1, respectively. Furthermore, the overall
barrier of the M06-2X/6-31G(d) level suggests that the monomer reaction
with a value of 124 kJ mol–1 is more favorable than
the dimer reaction with a value of 144 kJ mol–1.
Interestingly, M06-2X/6-31G(d) overestimates the energy barrier comparatively
to other levels of theory. This is in agreement with our recent study
of the direct 1,4-proton transfer.5 Higher
activation energies result from the calculation at CCSD(T)+CF, where
the barrier is relatively at its highest respective values of 102
and 180 kJ mol–1 for pathways C1 and C2. By comparison,
a previous study on the VHP channel from the syn-CI of limonene in
the presence of H2O as a catalyst reported lower energy
values by roughly 30 kJ mol–1, utilizing CCSD(T)+CF.37 Intuitively, this is attributed to the chemistry
of the CI (syn or anti) and most importantly, whether it is treated
as a biradical or zwitterion.

3 Conclusions
In this
study, the mechanisms of the gas-phase SOZ and hydration
reactions of the anti-CI that result from the ozonolysis of sabinene
have been investigated using quantum-chemical calculations. The SOZ
formation could proceed from two different reactions: the sabinene
CI and formaldehyde or the sabina ketone and formaldehyde oxide (CI)
with corresponding activation energies within the range of ±5
kJ mol–1. However, the calculations show that the
SOZ formation is more plausible from the former reaction than the
latter. Furthermore, CCSD(T)+CF is the most suitable level of theory
in terms of the energy barrier, relative to the other methods of calculation
in the SOZ pathway. However, in this pathway, further reactions are
required to increase the understanding of the SOA phenomena.

Upon comparing the structural parameters and activation energies
for the hydration reaction of the anti-CI with H2O and
2H2O acquired at different levels of theory, it was found
that M06-2X/6-31G(d) is most reliable in describing the hydration
reactions (lowest energy barrier). Interestingly, the overall activation
energy of pathway B2 is barrierless at M06-2X/6-31G(d). Moreover,
the reaction of the anti-CI with H2O is slower than with
2H2O, where the overall energy barrier of the latter is
lower than the former by 60 kJ mol–1, at the M06-2X/6-31G(d)
level of theory. Thus, the formation of sabina ketone, H2O, and H2O2 (pathway B2) is more favorable
than the formation of sabina ketone and H2O2 (pathway B1) at different levels of theory. Furthermore, the role
of the second H2O molecule in the reaction with 2H2O as a spectator at B3LYP/6-31G(d) reveals that the reaction
is less favorable, as the overall activation energy is higher than
the H2O mediator role by 49 kJ mol–1.
This study sheds more light on the water monomer and dimer reactions:
the fact that the reaction is governed by dissociation of α-hydroxy
hydroperoxide by a second transition state rather than forming it
only.

In the atmosphere, the formation of sabina ketone and
OH radicals
from the anti-CI of direct VHP formation and dissociation is interestingly
more possible than the water-mediated VHP, with lower overall activation
energies. The DFT calculations suggest that the direct VHP channel
is more plausible roughly by 5 kJ mol–1. Furthermore,
the VHP channel with the water monomer is significantly more attainable
than the dimer at different levels of theory. Thus, the 1,4 proton
transfer for the direct VHP leads to the rapid radicals’ formation
compared with the mediated reactions. Furthermore, the DFT calculation
shed more light on the level of theory used, in which most reliable
in these channels is B3LYP/6-311G(3df,3pd), that is, comparative and
more adequate than other methods. Although the reaction is water-mediated,
M06-2X/6-31G(d) overestimates the barriers by about 77 kJ mol–1 relative to the other DFT methods.

4 Computational Methods
All of the geometry computations were
performed using the Gaussian
09 (G09) suite.51 All optimized structures
were optimized at B3LYP and M06-2X, utilizing the basis sets of 6-31G(d),
6-31G(2df,p), and 6-311G(3df,3pd).52−54 The 6-31+G(d) basis
set has also been used to test the effect of diffuse functions on
the energy barrier. Furthermore, single-point energy calculations
using the coupled-cluster theory with triple excitation [CCSD(T)]55,56 at 6-31G(d) and the frozen core second-order Møller–Plesset
perturbation theory (MP2) at 6-31G(d) and 6-311++G(d,p) were performed
based on the B3LYP/6-31G(d) geometries. A correction factor (CF) from
the difference in energy between the MP2/6-31G(d) and MP2/6-311++G(d,p)
levels of theory was applied to evaluate the effect of basis sets
on the activation energies. Subsequently, the energy values of the
CCSD(T)/6-31G(d) level of theory were corrected by the CF, corresponding
to CCSD(T)/6-31G(d)+CF [henceforth, identified as CCSD(T)+CF]. It
should be noted that the B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p) level of theory was not
used for the last two pathways of the hydration reactions of the anti-CI.
This is due to high energy barrier calculated at B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p).
Moreover, the optimized geometries of all stationary points for the
proposed reactions depicted in the figures are selected at B3LYP/6-311G(3df,3pd).
This is because the optimized structures were comparable at all the
investigated levels of theory. Hence, within the B3LYP formalism,
choosing higher basis set changes the geometries only very marginally.

The transition states were verified using the intrinsic reaction
coordinate method, ensuring the connection of all stationary points
on the PES.57 Minima were confirmed as
those geometries with no imaginary frequencies, and transition states
were those with one imaginary frequency. Relative energies of all
stationary points were corrected by the zero-point vibrational energies
(ZPE). Furthermore, minima structures of radicals were optimized by
applying the unrestricted wave function, UB3LYP, UM06-2X, UMP2, and
UCCSD(T) with the use of the quadratically convergent self-consistent
field (SCF = QC). Moreover, to provide a spectral insight, the IR
spectra of sabina ketone was calculated by the vibrational frequency
analysis, at the B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p) level of theory. The peak heights
were applied with 10 cm–1 of the half-width at half
height, and a scaling factor of 0.9692 was used for the calculated
frequencies.58
