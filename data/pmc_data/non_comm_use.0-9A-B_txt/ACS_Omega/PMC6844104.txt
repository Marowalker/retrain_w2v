We
created a glucose oxidase (GOx) working electrode on a silicon-on-insulator
(SOI) wafer for glucose sensing. The SOI wafer was electrically connected
to a copper wire, and the GOx was immobilized onto the hydrophilized
SOI surface via silanization with aminopropyltriethoxysilane and glutaraldehyde.
Electrochemical analysis (i.e., cyclic voltammetry) was employed to
identify the sensing mechanism and to evaluate the performance of
these SOI–GOx glucose sensors. The response of the SOI–GOx
working electrode was significantly higher in the presence of oxygen
than that without oxygen, indicating that a hydrogen peroxide pathway
dominated in our SOI–GOx electrode. The height of cathodic
peaks increased linearly with the increase of glucose concentrations
up to 15 mM. The SOI–GOx working electrode displayed good stability
after more than 30 cycles. On the 133rd day after the electrode
was made, although the response of the SOI–GOx electrode dropped
to about one-half of its original response, it was still capable of
distinguishing different glucose concentrations. This work suggests
that the SOI–GOx working electrode that we developed might
be a promising candidate for implantable glucose sensors.

1 Introduction
The regulation and maintenance
of glucose are essential for the
survival of living organisms.1,2 Diabetes is a disorder
that involves an individual’s inability to regulate glucose.2 Individuals affected by diabetes must tightly
regulate and control their consumption of glucose. At present, diabetes
patients typically monitor their glucose levels several times a day
by pricking their finger,2−4 which is painful and inconvenient.
Moreover, this conventional method of glucose monitoring tests only
the present level of blood glucose and does not reflect an individual’s
fluctuating glucose levels throughout the day. The development of
a reliable and long-term method for continuous glucose monitoring
has been an area of growing interest.3 Implantable
glucose biosensors are continuous glucose monitoring devices that
can potentially alleviate the shortcomings of conventional glucose
monitoring methods.5,6

The development of glucose
oxidase (GOx)-based enzymatic electrochemical
glucose sensors that incorporate nanomaterials, polymers, and/or biocomposites
has been an active research area that has attracted significant attention
in recent years. Carbon-based nanomaterials, including multiwalled
carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs),7−9 single-walled carbon nanotubes,10 graphene,11 electrochemically
reduced graphene oxide-multiwalled carbon nanotube hybrid (ERGO-MWCNT),12 and carbon nano-onions13 have been widely used to immobilize GOx by modifying glassy carbon
electrodes (GCEs), Au/Cr-coated glass substrate,10 or indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass plate.7 In a recent publication by Chen et al.,14 multiwalled carbon nanotube-coated carbonized
silk fabric (MWCNTs/CSF) decorated with Pt microspheres was used as
the working electrode for a flexible electrochemical glucose sensor.
In addition to carbon-based nanomaterials, inorganic nanomaterials,
such as Au nanoparticles (AuNPs),15,16 nanostructured
Au thin films,17 and Au, CdS, and ZnS nanostructures,18 have also been employed to achieve GOx immobilization
for glucose sensing. Moreover, glucose sensors based on polymer/GOx
biocomposites, such as poly(pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid) (PCPy),19 have also been demonstrated.

Semiconductor
nanomembranes (NMs),20 owing to their high
crystalline quality and compliant nature, have
been demonstrated as excellent platforms for strain-engineered devices21,22 and flexible biosensors.23,24 A most convenient approach
to create a flexible semiconductor NM is to release the silicon (Si)
template layer of a commercial silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer by
etching away the buried oxide sandwiched between the Si template layer
and the bulk Si handling substrate. If a film with a different lattice
constant, for example, a Ge film,25 is
deposited on the Si template layer, a tube or “jelly roll”
is formed upon releasing the Si/Ge bilayer structure from the handling
substrate, due to the presence of the unbalanced strain.26 Such a tube or jelly roll has the potential
to serve as the platform for a glucose sensor to be implanted into
a human’s blood vessel.

In this article, we demonstrate
the creation of a GOx enzyme electrochemical
working electrode on an SOI wafer, an important step toward the development
of semiconductor NM-based tubular-shaped implantable glucose sensors.
We start from a small piece of commercial SOI wafer and create an
SOI-based electrode by coating its back surface, sides, and edges
of the front surface with silver epoxy and attaching a copper wire
to the back surface. The hydrophilization of the SOI surface is achieved
by oxygen plasma treatment, and the surface is then covered with organofunctional
alkoxysilane molecules,27 a process called
silanization.27 When GOx is spread on the
surface, a dipeptide bond is formed between GOx and the Si template
layer, enabling the immobilization of GOx on the SOI surface. This
homemade SOI–GOx electrode serves as the working electrode
of a three-electrode system, where commercial silver/silver chloride
electrode and commercial platinum electrode are used as the reference
electrode and counter electrode, respectively. We carry out cyclic
voltammetry (CV) measurement using this three-electrode system in
phosphate buffer solution (PBS) with glucose concentrations from 1
to 15 mM. Based on CV analysis, we identify the sensing mechanism
and evaluate the performance of the SOI–GOx glucose sensor.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Preparation of SOI Electrode
SOI
wafers were cut with a diamond scriber to approximately 4 mm ×
4 mm in size and cleaned first using acetone and then isopropyl alcohol
in an ultrasonic water bath. Once the SOI wafer was air-dried, it
was coated on the back, sides, and approximately 1 mm on each edge
of the front surface with silver epoxy. A copper wire was then attached
to the back of the wafer with silver epoxy, as shown in Figure 1. The electrode was maintained
at a temperature of 140 °C for 15 min in a muffle furnace to
cure silver epoxy. It was then treated by oxygen plasma with a power
of 300 W for 10 min, inside a PE25-JW plasma cleaning system, to make
the surface hydrophilic.28

Figure 1 Schematic illustration
showing how an SOI–GOx working electrode
is created. The SOI wafer surface, copper wire, silver epoxy, SOI
surface after treatment with oxygen plasma, immobilization layer on
an SOI surface, and GOx layer on an immobilized SOI surface are shown
in purple, copper, gray, orange, blue, and white, respectively. Anywhere
within the black outline in the final step, except the area with immobilized
GOx on the front surface (i.e., within the square boundary), is covered
by regular epoxy.

2.2 Immobilization
of GOx on SOI Surface
We employed the following immobilization
technique, modified from
Subramanian and co-workers,27 to immobilize
GOx on the hydrophilic SOI surface. The SOI electrode was first immersed
in a 10% (v/v) solution of aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) in toluene
for 10 min in a water bath that is kept at 37 °C and then immersed
in 1% (v/v) solution of glutaraldehyde (GA) in distilled water for
5 min. Finally, the surface of the electrode was washed with 0.1 M
PBS at pH 7.4.

A solution of 1 mg/mL GOx in a 50 mM sodium acetate
buffer was prepared. With a micropipette, 10 μL of GOx was spread
on the exposed SOI surface and incubated at 4 °C overnight. On
the following day, regular epoxy was used to cover all of the exposed
silver epoxy and the portion of the copper wire that would go into
the electrochemical cell, as shown in Figure 1. The regular epoxy was allowed to harden
fully for 24 h before cyclic voltammetry measurement. The modification
of the SOI template layer surface with oxygen plasma treatment, silanization,
and GOx attachment is illustrated in Figure 2.

plasma treatment, silanization, and GOx attachment.

2.3 Electrochemical Analysis
Our homemade
SOI–GOx electrode was used as the working electrode in a three-electrode
system in the CHI600E electrochemical analyzer. The reference electrode
used was a commercial silver/silver chloride electrode, and the counter
electrode used was a commercial platinum electrode. We carried out
cyclic voltammetry measurements for glucose solutions with glucose
concentrations of 1–15 mM in 0.1 M PBS, with a scan rate of
0.075 V/s. All electrodes were washed with deionized water before
starting a new measurement in a fresh glucose solution.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Identification of the Sensing
Mechanism
Figure 3 shows a
typical CV for an SOI–GOx electrode at a glucose concentration
of 3 mM, with and without the presence of oxygen. CVs at other glucose
concentrations and for other SOI–GOx electrodes also exhibited
similar “duck” shape,29 with
two distinct redox peaks. Peaks that appeared between −0.15
and −0.2 V were reduction peaks, and those between 0 and −0.1
V were oxidation peaks. As is evident in Figure 3, in the absence of oxygen, the response
of the SOI–GOx working electrode was significantly reduced
compared to the response in the presence of oxygen. This indicates
that a hydrogen peroxide pathway, instead of direct electron transfer,
dominates in our SOI–GOx electrode10 1   2  During the reaction,
molecular oxygen acts
as an electron acceptor, which produces hydrogen peroxide from the
oxidation of the reduced flavin moiety of GOx (eq 2).4 The production
of hydrogen peroxide, which is measured electrochemically,4,30 is proportional to the glucose concentration, allowing sensing of
glucose concentration through CV measurements.

for a typical SOI–GOx working electrode
at a glucose concentration of 3 mM, with and without the presence
of oxygen.

3.2 Responses
of the SOI–GOx Glucose Sensor
at Different Glucose Concentrations
Figure 4A shows the evolution of the cyclic voltammogram
of a typical SOI–GOx working electrode as the glucose concentration
was increased from 1 to 15 mM. With the increase of glucose concentration,
the magnitude of the cathodic peak (i.e., reduction peak) increased
monotonically. It is therefore feasible to employ the cathodic peak
current as a sensing parameter of our SOI–GOx sensors. The
reduction peak potential exhibited a slightly negative shift with
increasing glucose concentration, which was likely due to the increased
amount of reduced GOx at the electrode’s surface when the cathodic
trace was scanned.29

Figure 4 (A) Cyclic voltammograms
for an SOI–GOx working electrode
at glucose concentrations of 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 mM, in
the presence of oxygen. Inset: a blow-up view of the cathodic peaks
shown in the main panel. (B) Absolute value of the average cathodic
peak current |Ic|P (black symbols),
obtained from three devices, is plotted as a function of glucose concentration
in the range of 1–15 mM. A linear fit to the data (red line)
is also shown.

The magnitude of the anodic peak
(i.e., oxidation peak) also increased
with glucose concentration in general, but the change was not as significant
compared to that of the cathodic peak. This could possibly be attributed
to the alteration on the active site of GOx.3,31,32 The active site of GOx widened during the
reaction with glucose, which made the reduced GOx more selective for
hydrogen peroxide rather than oxygen.31,32 As a result,
some reduced GOx shifted toward an inactive state and could not bind
glucose when the anodic trace was scanned. As more GOx became inactive
on the electrode surface, the oxidation peak might not increase or
might even decrease with increasing glucose concentration.3,31,32

Figure 4B shows
the absolute value of the average cathodic peak current |Ic|P (black symbols), obtained from three devices,
as a function of the glucose concentration C. The
|Ic|P vs C data is fitted to a linear function (red line), |Ic|P = 0.34 (μA/mM) × C + 11.7 μA, with a linearity correlation coefficient of 0.9909.
The sensitivity of our SOI–GOx electrodes is therefore determined
to be 0.34 μA/mM, or 8.5 μA/(mM cm2), which
is higher or comparable to GOx-GCE electrodes immobilized by MWCNT8 or ERGO-MWCNT hybrid materials,12 and GOx-ITO electrodes immobilized by Au, CdS, and ZnS
nanostructures.18 Moreover, our SOI–GOx
electrodes displayed nearly linear response in a wide range of glucose
concentrations, up to 15 mM, which is wider compared to a majority
of glucose sensors reported in the literature.8−12,14,15,17,18

3.3 Stability of the SOI–GOx Glucose Sensor
For applications in implantable sensing devices, stability and
lifetime are important characteristics to be considered. To evaluate
its stability, we monitored the CV of the sensor while running it
continuously for multiple times, and the peak current retained 97%
or higher of its original value after more than 30 cycles. We also
evaluated the response of an SOI–GOx electrode on the 7th and the 133rd days after it was created. Figure 5A shows the cyclic
voltammograms of the sensor in PBS with a glucose concentration of
7 mM, on days 7 and 133. Although the peak currents on day 133 dropped
to about one-half of the values on day 7, both anodic and cathodic
peaks were still distinct on day 133, and the “duck”
shape of the CV remained. The half-life (t1/2) of our glucose sensor is estimated to be 4–5 months, which
is considerably longer than that reported in the literature.16Figure 5B shows cyclic voltammograms of the sensor in PBS with glucose
concentrations of 3, 7, and 13 mM, on day 133. The apparent increase
of peak currents with increasing glucose concentrations indicated
that our glucose sensor was still capable of distinguishing glucose
concentrations 133 days after the device was made.

4 Conclusions
To summarize, we have created
SOI–GOx working electrodes
through immobilizing GOx onto the SOI surface via silanization with
APTES and GA, for glucose sensing. The significant suppression of
the response of the SOI–GOx electrode in the absence of oxygen,
compared to its response in the presence of oxygen, suggested that
a hydrogen peroxide pathway dominated in our SOI–GOx electrode.
As revealed from the evolution of CV, the cathodic peak currents of
these SOI–GOx electrodes increased monotonically and nearly
linearly with the increase of glucose concentrations, in a broad range
of 1–15 mM. The sensitivity of the electrodes was determined
to be 0.34 μA/mM or 8.5 μA/(mM cm2). Moreover,
these SOI–GOx working electrodes displayed good stability and
were capable of distinguishing different glucose concentrations even
133 days after the electrode was made. These results suggest that
our SOI–GOx working electrode might be a promising candidate
for implantable glucose sensors.
