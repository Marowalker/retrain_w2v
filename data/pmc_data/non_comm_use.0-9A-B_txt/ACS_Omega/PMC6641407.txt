For
the first time, we report the effects of elevated temperatures,
from 80 to 100 °C, on the changes in the states of water and
ion–water channels and their correlation with the proton conductivity
of Nafion NR212, which was investigated using a Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy study. Experimentally, three types of water
aggregates, protonated water (H+(H2O)n), nonprotonated hydrogen (H)-bonded water (H2O···H2O), and non-H-bonded water,
were found in Nafion, and the existence of those three types of water
was confirmed through ab initio molecular dynamics simulation. We
found that the proton conductivity of Nafion increased for up to 80
°C, but from 80 to 100 °C, the conductivity did not increase;
rather, all of those elevated temperatures showed identical conductivity
values. The proton conductivities at lower relative humidities (RHs)
(up to 50%) remained nearly identical for all elevated temperatures
(80, 90, and 100 °C); however, from 60% RH (over λ = 4),
the conductivity remarkably jumped for all elevated temperatures.
The results indicated that the amount of randomly arranged water gradually
increased and created more H-bonded water networks in Nafion at above
60% RH. From the deconvolution of the O–H bending band, it
was found that the volume fraction fi (i=each deconvoluted band) of H-bonded water for elevated temperatures (>80–100 °C)
increased remarkably higher than for 60 °C.

Introduction
Polymer electrolyte
fuel cells (PEFCs) have attracted a great deal
of attention as alternative and environmentally friendly energy sources
for transportation, portable devices, and stationary power.1,2 Recently, increasing attention has been paid to higher temperature
PEFC systems because of their higher power efficiency.3,4 The development of new materials for high-temperature proton-conducting
membranes for PEFCs requires a better understanding of the working
conditions of the membrane.5

Peron
et al. worked on the proton conductivity of Nafion211 at
elevated temperatures for varied relative humidities (RHs), though
they reported the results for up to 80 °C only.6 In their study, at 80 °C, the conductivity increased
from 0.0012 to 0.13 S/cm as RH is increased from 10 to 95%. Alberti
et al.7 worked on the proton conductivity
of Nafion117 at elevated temperatures (80–160 °C) as a
function of RH. Though they found a very slight increase of the conductivity
for 100% RH, in their another work,8,9 they observed
that at 100% RH, some instability of Nafion starts for near 80 °C.
From lower to 85% RH, they found almost identical values of conductivity
for 80–140 °C (after it started to decrease). They considered
that the expected growth of the conductivity was compensated by some
kind of modification of the polymer matrix which decreases the mobility
and the effective concentration of the charge carriers at those higher
temperatures. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy has been
extensively applied to characterize the chemical structure of Nafion.10−12 Molecular level interactions that influence the states of water
in Nafion materials have been investigated by the FTIR spectroscopy
technique.13 States of water are the key
factors for the proton conduction in electrolyte membranes. Lu et
al. carried out dielectric relaxation spectroscopic study on Nafion117
in the acid (H+) form at several hydration levels and detected
three states of water, each exhibiting distinct dynamics.14 As the infrared (IR) spectrum shows a specific
absorption pattern depending on the molecular structure, in many cases,
it is used for structural and qualitative analyses of a substance.
The sensitivity of IR spectroscopy toward water has made it valuable
for the study of hydration.15−19 Gruger et al. used the combination of near-IR Raman scattering and
attenuated total reflection FTIR (ATR–FTIR) to analyze the
varied types of water bands in heat-treated Nafion; however, they
measured FTIR spectra only at ambient temperature.20 Laporta et al. investigated the states of water in perfluorosulfonated
membrane (Nafion) at ambient temperature and varied RHs by differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermal gravimetric analysis, and FTIR,
and they could obtain valuable information on molecular interactions,
especially those involving water molecules, particularly through the
FTIR technique.21 Ping et al. worked on
the states of water in different hydrophilic polymers through DSC
and FTIR, and they showed that the absorbed water in the hydrophilic
polymer develops two types of hydrogen bonds (H-bonds): one corresponds
to the water molecules directly attached to the active site of the
polymer to form the first hydration layer and another corresponds
to the water molecules in the second hydration layer.22

Kim et al. worked on the states of water on the physical
and electrochemical
properties of sulfonated poly(arylene ether sulfone) and Nafion and
found that the states of water correlate with the proton conductivity.23 Some other groups24,25 also have
discussed the relationship between the states of water and the proton
conductivity of Nafion at ambient temperature. Kunimatsu et al. studied
the states of water in Nafion NR211 by ATR–FTIR, and from the
analysis of the O–H bending region of water, they showed that
the proton conductivity is closely associated with the growth of weakly
H-bonded water.24 However, they did not
discuss the O–H stretching band region, and also they measured
and discussed FTIR results only for room temperature, not for higher
temperatures. Hofmann et al. investigated the structure of water in
Nafion membranes by IR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation,
and they were able to distinguish between the water molecules on the
“surface” of the pores of the membrane as opposed to
the bulk water molecules in the cavities of the system.25 They deconvoluted the O–H stretching
(4000–2500 cm–1) band region into four peaks,
and through the MD simulation, they assigned those peaks according
to H-bonding. Ferrari et al. worked on water distribution in Aquivion
utilizing ATR–FTIR, and through a spectral deconvolution process
of the O–H stretching region (3700–2400 cm–1), they identified four different types of water species in Aquivion.26 However, they also measured FTIR–ATR
of Aquivion at 35 °C and (0–50)% RH only and did not assign
all of the deconvoluted peaks precisely, especially the peak at the
highest wavenumber (3515 cm–1).

As discussed
above, until now, there are many reports on the proton
conductivity and states of water in Nafion for ambient temperature
up to 80 °C for varied RHs; however, to our knowledge, there
is almost no report on the states of water at elevated temperatures
(80–100 °C) simultaneously with varied RHs and their correlation
with the proton conductivity. The possible reason of no report for
elevated temperatures may be due to the unavailability of FTIR system
for simultaneous measurement at elevated temperatures (up to 100 °C)
and varied RHs (up to 100% RH), as this measurement system needs a
high-temperature-, high-pressure-, and high-RH-controlled ATR–FTIR
sample chamber and vapor-producing system. On the other hand, presently,
the operating temperature of a fuel cell is 80 °C, so it is indispensable
to investigate and know the hydrated morphology, states of water,
and their correlation with the proton conductivity of Nafion at elevated
temperatures (up to 100 °C), as those data will be helpful to
design lower-cost perfluorinated polymer electrolyte membranes for
PEFCs which can be used at higher temperatures (up to 100 °C).
Therefore, we, with the engineering cooperation of several companies
in Japan, developed a specially designed high-temperature-, high-pressure-,
and high-RH-controlled ATR–FTIR system, through which we succeeded
in controlling and measuring the ATR–FTIR spectra of polymer
membranes for up to 100 °C while keeping the RH controlled up
to 100% RH.

In the present paper, we first report the morphological
changes,
states of water at elevated temperatures (80–100 °C) and
varied RHs (up to 100% RH), and their correlation with the proton
conductivity in Nafion212, which are not published yet. We also performed
ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation on the states of water
at an elevated temperature (80 °C) to support the experimental
results of ATR–FTIR on the types of water in a Nafion212 membrane.

Results
Number
of Water Molecules per Sulfonate Group
The number
of water molecules per sulfonic acid group (λ(H2O/–SO3H)) was plotted against RH and is shown in Figure 1. The λ value increased
with increasing RH; however, λ was nearly identical for all
temperatures. Therefore, the RH dependence can be used for the investigation
of different hydration levels at each temperature.

Figure 1 λ as a function
of RH for varied elevated temperatures for
Nafion NR212.

Proton Conductivity
The proton conductivity of Nafion
at varied temperatures is presented as a function of RH in Figure 2. The conductivity
of the membrane depended strongly on the temperature and RH for all
temperatures. The proton conductivities for 80 °C at 60 and 80%
RH were found to be 0.05 and 0.1 S/cm, respectively. Dimitrov et al.
investigated the humidity dependence of the proton conductivity for
Nafion NR212, and their results (for 80 °C, σ ≈
0.05 and 0.95 S/cm at 60 and 80% RH, respectively) were almost identical
to our results.34Figure 2 shows two distinct regions for conductivity;
at a low RH, nondependency of the proton conductivity on temperature
was observed; that is, the conductivity remained nearly identical
for up to 50% RH for all temperatures. At a higher RH, that is, from
60% RH, the conductivity for elevated temperatures (>80 °C)
was
higher than that for 60 °C. When the RH was increased up to 70%
and over, the difference became more remarkable. Surprisingly, we
found that the proton conductivity above 80 °C did not increase
anymore and the conductivities from 80 to 100 °C were almost
identical. Until now, the proton conductivity of Nafion at over 80
°C with varied RHs is not reported yet by any researcher, and
this new result is an important finding in the field of PEFC development.

conductivity of Nafion NR212 as a function of RH for varied
elevated temperatures. Unexpectedly, the conductivity above 80 °C
did not increase anymore up to 100 °C, and the values for 80–100
°C were nearly identical.

Humidity-Dependent ATR–FTIR Spectra for Nafion NR212
at Varied Temperatures
The effect of humidity for varied
elevated temperatures was investigated to understand the states of
water in Nafion. Figure 3a shows the ATR–FTIR spectra of Nafion for 90 °C at varied
RHs (the FTIR spectra for other temperatures can be found in the Supporting Information). The typical spectra
of hydrated Nafion showed a broad absorption band at 3448 cm–1 corresponding to O–H stretching,35 1721 and 1633 cm–1 corresponding to O–H
bending,24 1311 corresponding to CF3 stretching,36 1193 cm–1 corresponding to asymmetrical C–F stretching,24 1142 cm–1 corresponding to
symmetrical C–F stretching,24 1055
cm–1 corresponding to symmetrical S–O stretching
with CCO bending,37 967 cm–1 corresponding to symmetrical S–O stretching with C–S
stretching,37 and 625 cm–1 corresponding to the CF2 rocking mode.35 Although very weak, the O–H stretching band arising
from non-H-bonded H2O,15,16,38−42 that is, OH groups without a donating H-bond, was identified at
3693 cm–1 for temperature above 80 °C.38,43 It was observed that O–H stretching and O–H bending
band intensities increased significantly with increasing RH and the
bands at 1410 and 914 cm–1 assigned to S=O
and S–OH, respectively,18 of SO3H groups diminished with increasing hydration; however, the
band at 625 cm–1 remained constant for all RHs.
For O–H stretching, appearance of a new shoulder peak at around
3223 cm–1 was noticed with increasing RH. For all
temperatures, similar results were found. Though the above-described
spectra for varied temperatures above 80 °C resemble each other,
a considerable variation in their band intensities and shapes was
found from the data analysis. The above data are summarized in Table 1.

AIMD Simulation
on the States of Water
The AIMD simulation
results for the O–H stretching region of the decomposed spectra
are shown in Figure 4a. The decomposition of the stretching modes shown in the figure
consisted of three major peaks. Hydrogen atoms in the W0 state represent
dangling bonds and have a peak at 3750 cm–1, which
is close to the gas-phase values. The spectra for the WW and WS states
have a strong peak at around 3500 cm–1, which is
in agreement with the main peak for liquid water. The spectra for
the HW and HS states show a broad peak at 2800–3050 cm–1. It is worth noting that several authors have reported
the presence of a peak at ∼2900 cm–1 in aqueous
solutions of strong acids, which is assigned to the O–H stretching
motion involving hydrated protons.44,45 Our result
is consistent with these measurements.

Figure 4 AIMD simulation result
for Nafion NR212 at 80 °C and 60% RH
for the O–H stretching (a) and O–H bending (b) regions.

The AIMD simulation results on
the decomposed spectra for the O–H
bending vibration region are shown in Figure 4b. The result for the bending modes shown
in the figure is dominated by a strong peak at around 1600 cm–1 and found to be rather insensitive to the hydrogen
state, except for the HW protons which show a blue shift of 50–100
cm–1 and a significant broadening. These HW protons
correspond to the center of Zundel cations.

Discussion
As can be seen from Figure 3a, disappearance of the peaks at 1410 and 914 cm–1 gave a clear indication of the dissociation of SO3H groups
with hydration, with the proton getting hydrogen-bonded to water.
The red shift of the −SO3– group
from 1064 to 1055 cm–1 gave the indication of H-bonding
of water molecules with the −SO3– group.

Types of Water in Nafion at Elevated Temperatures Analyzed from
the O–H Stretching Region
Figure 3b (enlarged from Figure 3a) shows the ATR–FTIR spectra for
the O–H stretching vibrational region for Nafion at 90 °C
and varied RHs. It was noticed that up to 40% RH, the absorbance intensity
increased systematically with increasing RH; from 40% RH, the intensity
started to increase rapidly; and from 60% RH, the intensity increased
remarkably. A new shoulder peak at 3223 cm–1 appeared
from 60% RH, indicating that the water networks spread out remarkably
and a new type of water aggregates started to form from this RH. It
was also observed that the very small peak at 3693 cm–1 gradually diminished with increasing RH. The above results indicated
that movement of water became dramatic at 90 °C and the polymer
matrix also became highly mobile at this temperature, which affects
the arrangement of large water aggregates in the membrane, and as
a result, many smaller water aggregates develop. This tendency clearly
started from a certain amount of water uptake (60% RH) in the membrane.
However, it was difficult to clarify the difference in the states
of water from those spectra. In this circumstance, as our purpose
was to investigate the states of water, we decided to deconvolute
the two main water bands, O–H stretching and O–H bending
bands, to deduce the types and states of water quantitatively. The
mass fraction of each water family can be obtained through a decomposition
of the water band, which allows following separately the peaks related
to each type of water molecules.23 Different
states of water have been proposed to exist in Nafion membranes corresponding
to different environments.46,47 Lu et al. observed
the states of water, manifested through three population averages
with distinctly resolved dynamical behaviors, and their changes with
temperature (25–45 °C) and hydration level.14 To clarify the spectral variations in the O–H
stretching region, the spectral shapes in the region were fitted using
Gaussian functions. The deconvolution result of the O–H stretching
region for 90 °C and 60% RH is shown in Figure 5. It was found that the O–H stretching
region consisted of four water components, which correspond to four
groups of vibrations. We assigned peak 1 (centered at 2923 cm–1) to protonated water (such as H3O+ ions) bonded with sulfonate groups (−SO3–···H3O+),20,21,25,48 peak 2 (centered at 3236 cm–1) to symmetric and
peak 3 (centered at 3465 cm–1) to asymmetric O–H
stretching vibrations, which were denoted as νs(HO–H···O)24,49,50 and νas(HO–H···O),24,49,50 respectively. Peak 4 (centered
at 3604 cm–1) was assigned to the stretching vibration
of non-H-bonded water (hydroxyl groups of water attached to the C–F
backbone of Nafion with weaker van der Waals force)
denoted as ν(HO–H···F).15,25 The indicated types of water for varied temperatures and RHs will
be discussed in the next section.

black: peak fitting; red: deconvoluted peak 1; blue: deconvoluted
peak 2; green: deconvoluted peak 3; and magenta: deconvoluted peak
4.

The deconvolution results of the
experimental spectra and simulated
spectra were found to be consistent for the stretching region. The
simulated W0 peak at 3750 cm–1 is the combination
of non H-bonded water peaks (peak from monomeric waters and peak from
waters attached to the C-F backbone), which corresponds to experimental
Peak 4 at 3604 cm–1, the combined peak of WW and
WS at 3500 cm–1 corresponds to the experimental
combined peak of O–H symmetric stretching (at 3236 cm–1, peak 2) and O–H asymmetric stretching (at 3465 cm–1, peak 3), and the combination of broad peaks of HS and HW at 2800–3050
cm–1 corresponds to the protonated water peak at
2923 cm–1 (peak 1) of the experimental result (Figure 5). The consistency
of the simulated peaks with the experimental peaks is shown in Table 2.

It is notable
here that computer simulation result cannot perfectly
reproduce the experimental spectroscopic data in general as found
in many papers.51−54 Also in the present case, the calculated results do not correspond
very well to the observed data about the vibrational frequencies.
However, what we want to know from the computer simulation is how
many types of water molecules subjected to the different environments
are there in the present Nafion system. The computer simulation revealed,
roughly speaking, the main three different states (Figure 4a,b), that is, (W0), (WW, WS),
and (HW, HS), exist in the present Nafion system. Therefore, to interpret
the complicated spectral profile of the observed water bands, we assumed
here that there are approximately three types of water band components,
as shown in Figure 5: (1) the 3604 cm–1 band comes from the non-H-bonded
water attached to the C–F backbone of Nafion, which corresponds
to W0 in the calculation, (2) the 3465 and 3236 cm–1 bands consisting of νas and νs modes, respectively, originate from the moderately bonded water,
corresponding to WW and WS of the simulated water, and (3) the 2923
cm–1 band originates from the protonated water molecules,
which may be related to the HW and HS states of water.

To estimate
the relative contents of these three water states,
we have separated the observed band profiles, as shown in Figure 5. As already mentioned,
the three states are assumed here. The integrated intensity of each
component i is expressed as Ai. The fraction fi of each band area Ai is calculated as 1  

However, it must be noticed here that the intensity fraction fi is not equal to the molar
fraction (Mi) of each
state. This is because we do not know the absorption coefficient εi of these component bands. According to the
Lambert–Beer’s law, 2  where εi is the
absorption coefficient, ci is the concentration of each type of water (mol/L), and l is the length of light path (thickness of Nafion) of each
water component. Mi is
given as 3  

Therefore, as long as the coefficient εi is not known, Mi cannot be evaluated correctly. In the present paper, the change
of different water aggregation states is discussed using fi as a measure of Mi.

Changes in the above structurally
different water aggregates at
varied temperatures and RHs found from the O–H stretching band
are shown in Figure 6. Figure 6a shows
the relative fractional area, fst(p1) (%),
for the protonated water (p1) for varied RHs, and from the figure,
it was found that the protonated water bonded with sulfonate groups
(−SO3–···(H)+(H2O)n) was nearly unchanged for
up to 40% RH and, from over 40% RH, started to decrease with increasing
RH and the areas for all temperatures were nearly identical. It was
also found that the fraction fst(p2) for
H-bonded water (p2) showing symmetric stretching vibration, νs(HO–H···O), was nearly unchanged with
increasing RH and nearly identical for all temperatures (though fst(p2) for 100 °C was slightly lower than
those for other temperatures) (not shown, see the Supporting Information). However, from Figure 6b (from the lower part of the figure), we
found that the fraction fst(p3) for H-bonded
water (p3) showing asymmetric stretching vibration νas(HO–H···O) increased remarkably with increasing
RH for all temperatures. At this stage, we plotted the total H-bonded
water (p2 + p3) to deduce the effect of combined (νs + νas) H-bonded water on fst(p2+p3), which is shown in the upper part of Figure 6b, and from here, we observed
that the resultant amount of H-bonded water increased with increasing
RH for all temperatures. The band at 3200 cm–1 can
be assigned to the symmetric O–H stretching (νs) of tetrahedrally coordinated water molecules,55,56 and the band at around 3450 cm–1 can be attributed
to the asymmetric O–H stretching (νas) of
water molecules in a random arrangement.55,56 The peak at 3200 cm–1 demonstrates that the water
molecules at the interface are arranged in a more ordered structure.57 MD simulations showed that the interfacial regions
of the aqueous domains in Nafion are quite irregular.58 From the result of deconvolution, we consider that the
above deconvoluted band p2 arose from the O–H symmetric stretching
vibration of symmetrically ordered H-bonded water molecules and the
band p3 arose from the O–H asymmetric stretching vibration
of randomly arranged H-bonded water in the Nafion membrane. We suggest
that though the amount of symmetrically ordered water was nearly unchanged,
the amount of randomly arranged water gradually increased and created
more H-bonded water networks in Nafion, so the resultant amount of
H-bonded water increased with increasing RH (Figure 6b, upper part). Kunimatsu et al. also found
increased amount of H-bonded water form larger water channels during
hydration at room temperature, and the H-bonded water combines the
isolated hydrophilic domains containing hydrated protons.24 The fraction fst(p4) for the non-H-bonded water (water attached to the C–F backbone)
for the outer phase of the water clusters was also analyzed (not shown,
see the Supporting Information). The amount
of non-H-bonded water was found nearly identical for all RHs, and
elevated temperatures had a negligible effect on the amount of water.

water (νas) (p3, dashed line, lower) and resultant

H-bonded water increased with increased temperature and RH.

Types of Water in Nafion
at Elevated Temperatures Analyzed from
the O–H Bending Band
Figure 3c (enlarged from Figure 3a) shows the ATR–FTIR spectra for
the O–H bending vibrational region for Nafion at 90 °C
and varied RHs. It was observed that the absorbance intensity of the
protonated water band at 1721 cm–1 increased for
up to 20% RH, after that, no difference in the intensity was found
for up to 40% RH, and then the intensity started to decrease from
60% RH. However, the intensity of the H-bonded water band at 1633
cm–1 increased remarkably from 40% RH, and from
60% RH, the intensity jumped remarkably. This is a significant result,
and by the MD study, one of our collaborator groups has also confirmed
this phenomenon that from over 60% RH, water starts to make a better
and faster water network in Nafion. We will report this result in
detail in future.

To investigate the states of water, we also
decided to deconvolute the water bending (δ(HOH)) vibration
band to deduce the component water peaks, and the result is shown
in Figure 7. We found
more concrete information of the effect of elevated temperatures on
the states of water in Nafion from the O–H band region. From
the deconvolution, it was found that the O–H bending band consisted
of three component bands with different peak positions: a slightly
broad peak at 1836 cm–1 (p1), an intermediate peak
at 1711 cm–1 (p2), and a sharp peak at 1630 cm–1 (p3). We have assigned peaks p1 and p2 (decomposed
from the experimental broad band centered at 1721 cm–1) to protonated water, HxOy+(H2O)n.59 This band is composed of total
protonated water (hydronium (H3O+), Zundel (H5O2+), Eigen (H9O4+), and possible stronger ions) in the bending region.
Peak p3 at 1630 cm–1 was assigned to H-bonded water
((H2O)n), water hydrating −SO3– groups.24 The
AIMD simulated peaks (Figure 4b) were found to be consistent with the above experimental
decomposed peaks of the bending band. The simulated peak at 1600 cm–1 corresponds to the H-bonded water peak at 1630 cm–1 of the experimental result (p3, Figure 7), and the simulated Zundel
cation peak at around 1700 cm–1 corresponds to the
combined protonated water peak at 1836 (p1) and at 1711 cm–1 (p2) of the experimental result (Figure 7).

Figure 8 shows
the
dependence of relative volume fraction fbe(p1+p2) for the total protonated water (p1 + p2) found from the deconvolution
of the O–H bending band (Figure 7). It was found that fbe(p1+p2) for all temperatures decreased gradually with increasing RH. The
fraction for all temperatures was identical for up to 60% RH; however,
from 60% RH, it was remarkably lower for elevated temperatures (80–100
°C) than for 60 °C. Figure 9 (p3, lower part of figure) shows the dependence of
relative volume fraction fbe(p3) for the
H-bonded water. Again, we found that with increasing RH, the fraction fbe(p3) for H-bonded water was nearly unchanged
and identical for all temperatures for up to 40% RH and started to
increase from 40% RH. Though the fraction was identical for all temperatures
for up to 60% RH, from above 60% RH, fbe(p3) for elevated temperatures (80–100 °C) increased remarkably
higher than 60 °C. This phenomenon, that is, when fbe(p1+p2) is going down steeply from above 60% RH (Figure 8), fbe(p3) is going up steeply from the same RH (Figure 9, lower part), implies
that the water makes H-bond networks more effectively at a high water
content for elevated temperatures. This result also supported the
above O–H stretching band analysis result that the protonated
water (p1 of Figure 6a) decreased and the amount of H-bonded water (p2 + p3 of Figure 6b) increased with
increasing RH for all temperatures. However, though from the O–H
stretching analysis, the effect of elevated temperatures and RH on
the volume fraction for varied types of water could not be clarified
so well, with the support of the O–H stretching band analysis
results, we could distinguish the effect of temperature from the O–H
bending band analysis well.

elevated temperatures, deduced from the O–H bending region.
The fraction fbe(p1+p2) for protonated
water is going down steeply from above 60% RH for the temperatures
above 80 °C.

Figure 9 Correlation between the
states of water and the proton conductivity
of Nafion NR212 for varied elevated temperatures. Proton conductivities
reached equilibrium at 80 °C and did not increase with the increase
of temperature up to 100 °C. The conductivities for 80–100
°C were almost identical for varied RHs.

From the above discussion, we found that the O–H stretching
band is composed of three types of water [protonated water (such as
hydronium ion), H-bonded water, and non-H-bonded water] (Figure 5); however, the O–H
bending band is composed of two types of water (protonated water with
hydronium, Zundel, Eigen, and possible stronger ions and nonprotonated
H-bonded water) (Figure 7).

Again, we found a difference in the increasing tendency
of fraction
of H-bonded water between the stretching and bending regions. The
fraction of H-bonded water for the bending region for elevated temperatures
remarkably increased from above 60% RH (Figure 9, lower part). This tendency could not be
observed from the stretching region [Figure 6 (p2 + p3)]. The frequency of the OH stretching
mode is very sensitive to its molecular surrounding.60 We consider that possibly the O–H bond stretching
becomes slightly limited at a higher water content, which makes the
difference of fraction of H-bonded water of the stretching region
with the fraction of the bending region at elevated temperatures.
As the protonated water for both stretching and bending bands decreased
and non-H-bonded water was unchanged with increased temperature and
RH, we considered that H-bonded water has a direct effect and is mainly
responsible for the increase of the proton conductivity of Nafion.
We found a clear effect of H-bonded water from the O–H bending
mode, so we used H-bonded water of the bending mode to correlate the
proton conductivity at elevated temperatures.

Correlation between the
States of Water and the Proton Conductivity
at Elevated Temperatures
Proton transport, both in bulk water
and in Nafion, is intimately related to the structural dynamics of
the hydrogen bond network of water.61 The
conductivity of Nafion is highly dependent upon the states of water
in the membrane.62 The correlation between
the proton conductivity and the states of water at varied elevated
temperatures is shown in Figure 9. From the figure, it was observed that the proton
conductivity values for all temperatures for up to 50% RH were very
similar, after that, from 60% RH, the conductivity for elevated temperatures
increased remarkably higher than 60 °C, and the difference increased
with increasing RH. We compared the proton conductivity result with
fraction fbe(p3) for H-bonded water found
from the O–H bending analysis and observed a similar phenomenon
that fbe(p3) for H-bonded water for all
temperatures was nearly identical for up to 60% RH and after that
with increasing RH, the fraction for H-bonded water remarkably jumped
for elevated temperatures (80–100 °C). From these results,
the amount of increased H-bonded water can be correlated with the
increased proton conductivity in Nafion. Kunimatsu et al. worked on
the simultaneous measurements of proton conductivity and water uptake
at room temperature, and from the analysis of the O–H bending
band, they also suggested that the H-bonded water form water channels
and increase of intensity from the H-bonded water band at 1630 cm–1 caused the increase in the proton conductivity in
Nafion.24

The α-relaxation
peak corresponds to the glass-transition temperature of the ionic
domains of the neat Nafion in the acid form.35 α-Relaxation has been attributed to the onset of long-range
mobility of both main chain and side chain giving rise to the gradual
collapse of the static network and the subsequent evolution of a dynamic
network.63 Hydrophilic ionic domains become
extremely mobile at above the α-relaxation temperature, and
thus the interconnected channels in Nafion may eventually be disrupted
upon prolonged exposure to elevated temperatures.35 Sen et al. argued the possibility of a structural change
within Nafion at around 80–90 °C based on a viscosity
curve analysis.64 The α-relaxation
temperature of Nafion NR212 is around 80 °C (onset 70 °C)65 (see also the Supporting Information). In our present study, we first found that proton
conductivities of Nafion become maximum at 80 °C and do not increase
with the increase of temperature up to 100 °C, so we focused
our attention to clarify the phenomenon occurs at those higher temperatures.
We suggest that from 60% RH, when the temperature increases from 60
to 80 °C, the vibrational motion of the polymer matrix and movement
of water in Nafion increase, and gradually the system reaches equilibrium
with thermodynamically and morphologically comparatively stable condition
at around 80 °C. During this period of equilibrium, the randomly
arranged water gradually became interconnected, created relatively
broader H-bonded networks of water, and developed larger proton-conducting
ion–water channels,24 which directly
caused the increase of the proton conductivity. The pendant side chains,
which anchor the sulfonate groups to the fluorocarbon backbone, are
labile enough to rearrange and stabilize water clusters as the amount
of water increases.66 However, when the
temperature increased above 80 °C, though the movement of water
and polymer matrices increased more and became dramatic, the excess
movement of water and possible morphological change64 were not favorable to make the H-bonded network larger
anymore, and as a result, the proton conductivity also could not increase
anymore. Again, though the weaker H-bonded water networks did not
become larger at 90 or 100 °C, the H-bonds did not break; rather;
the H-bond networks were maintained, so the proton conductivity did
not decrease at those elevated temperatures.

Conclusions
Three types of water in Nafion212 at varied elevated temperatures
and RHs were found from the experimental results (from the deconvoluted
peaks for O–H stretching and bending bands of water), and AIMD
simulation result supported the experimental results. From the O–H
bending and stretching band deconvolution, we found that the content
of protonated water [(H)+(H2O)n] was decreased, H-bonded water was increased, and non-H-bonded
water was nearly unchanged with increasing RH for all temperatures.
From the O–H stretching band analysis, it was found that the
randomly arranged H-bonded water in Nafion212 gradually became interconnected
and created more H-bonded water networks with increasing RH. From
the O–H bending band analysis, interestingly, we found that
from over 60% RH, the amount of H-bonded water jumped for temperatures
above 80 °C, which clearly indicated that the randomly arranged
water makes and spreads out the H-bonded water networks very fast
from this RH. This result can be an important reference for the researchers
working on the movement of water and H-bonding networks in perfluorinated
membranes for fuel cells. The protonated water and non-H-bonded water
had a negligible effect; however, H-bonded water had prominent contribution
to the increase of the proton conductivity for Nafion212.

For
the first time, we report the proton conductivities for Nafion
for above 80–100 °C and varied RHs. We found that the
conductivity increases up to 80 °C; however surprisingly, the
conductivity did not increase after that and all values for elevated
temperatures were identical. The reason fro this phenomenon is discussed
on the basis of the equilibrium of the hydrated Nafion system. We
suggest that at around 80 °C, thermodynamically and morphologically,
the system already reaches equilibrium and after that at more higher
temperatures, the excess movement of water and polymer chains could
not make the ion–water channels larger anymore. However, even
up to 100 °C, the H-bonds did not break rather maintained, so
the proton conductivity did not decrease at those elevated temperatures.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Nafion NR212 membranes (thickness 50 μm)
in the H+ form [ion-exchange capacity (IEC) 0.92 mequiv/g]
purchased from DuPont were utilized for the measurements. The membranes
were dried at 80 °C for 24 h prior to all experiments. The chemical
structure of Nafion is shown in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Chemical Structure of Nafion in the H+ Form
FTIR Measurements
FTIR measurements were performed
by our specially designed high-temperature, high-pressure, and high-RH-controlled
ATR–FTIR system. The newly developed system can control and
measure the ATR–FTIR of polymer membranes for up to 100 °C
while keeping the RH controlled up to 100% RH. The schematic diagram
of our ATR–FTIR system is shown in Scheme 2. The FTIR spectra were recorded through
the ATR mode by using a PerkinElmer Spectrum 100 system with a Diamond
ATR crystal operated with a deuterated triglycine sulfate detector
and a zinc selenide (ZnSe) beam splitter for the range of 650–4000
cm–1. Each spectrum was recorded with a spectral
resolution of 4 cm–1, 128 scans averaged per spectrum.
The water vapor was produced in a specifically designed temperature-
and high-pressure-controlled thermostatic vessel system shown in Scheme 2. The water in the
vessel was heated by an electric heater, and the temperature of water
was equilibrated by rotating a small blade fan in the vessel. Dry
N2 gas was passed into the vessel, and thus the water vapor
was passed through a transfer tube into the specifically developed
air-tight, high-temperature-, high-pressure-, and high RH-controlled
ATR sample cell. A particular temperature and RH environment for the
sample was made by the simultaneous control of the sample cell temperature,
amount of N2 flow, temperature of the water in the vessel,
and the speed of the rotating blade fan. A high-temperature- and high-RH-resistant
sensor (HN-CJA2, Chino Corporation, Japan) was inserted into the air-tight
sample cell to monitor the temperature and RH of the Nafion sample.
As the KBr window in FTIR was damaged due to high RH, we used a high-temperature-
and high-RH-resistant window of ZnSe for the experiments. The size
of Nafion NR212 film was 1 cm × 1 cm. A flat-end screw gauge
was inserted into the air-tight sample cell to attach the sample on
the diamond ATR crystal. Before starting each ATR–FTIR measurement,
the Nafion film was placed on the ATR crystal and kept fixed at a
particular temperature and RH condition environment for 20 min to
reach equilibrium. The film was then pressed by a screw gauge from
the top, with an appropriate pressure on the surface of the film for
perfect adhesion on the ATR crystal. The measured temperature and
RH errors were ±1 °C and ±3% RH, respectively.

and High-Pressure-Controlled ATR–FTIR System
Water Uptake and Proton Conductivity Measurements
Water
uptake and in-plane proton conductivity were measured using an isothermal
absorption measurement system (MSB-AD-V-FC, BEL Japan Inc.) equipped
with an impedance analyzer (Solartron SI 1260). The system enabled
the simultaneous measurements of water uptake and in-plane proton
conductivity of membrane in the same chamber.27 The impedance spectra were recorded with the help of ZPlot/Zview
software under an ac perturbation signal of 10 mV over the frequency
range of 10 Hz to 100 kHz. Each membrane sample (1 cm × 4 cm)
was dried at 80 °C for 3 h under dry N2 flow and then
exposed to a humidified N2 environment under a controlled
temperature at 60–100 °C. After equilibration for several
hours, we confirmed that there was no further weight change of each
membrane, and membrane weight and proton conductivity were then measured
sequentially. The membrane weight was measured by a magnetic floating
balance under controlled humidity and temperature. Humidity conditions
were changed stepwise from 10 to 100% RH. In this magnetic floating
balance system, an electronically controlled magnetic suspension coupling
is used to transmit the measured force from the sample cell to the
microbalance. A free floating permanent magnet, which works as a suspension
magnet, was held by a stationary electromagnet attached to the balance.
The sample was hanged from the permanent magnet in a sample crucible.
This magnetic suspension coupling transmits the measuring force in
a noncontact manner from the sample chamber to the microbalance located
in ambient atmospheric conditions outside the sample chamber. The
proton conductivity was measured using a four-point probe cell fabricated
with two platinum foil electrodes for outer current carrying and two
platinum wire electrodes for inner potential sensing. The four-point
probe cell was attached to the impedance analyzer (Solartron SI 1260)
described above.

The in-plane proton conductivity (σ)
based on the four-point probe was calculated from the impedance data
according to following equation: 4  where A is the cross-sectional
area, d is the distance (1 cm) between two gold electrodes,
and R is the resistance value measured.

Number of Water
Molecules per Sulfonate Group
The number
of water molecules per sulfonate group at each RH, λ(H2O/SO3H), was calculated using the IEC value of Nafion
with the following equation: 5  where MWH2O is the molecular
weight of water (18.01 g·mol–1).

Spectral Deconvolution
Spectral deconvolution was performed
using a commercial software, GRAMS/AI Version 9.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific
Inc., USA). The background-subtracted FTIR spectra were first imported
to GRAMS/AI software and smoothed with a Savitzky–Golay function
(polynomial = 2 and points = 31). Then, the region for deconvolution
was selected, and the base line was corrected with a multipoint function.
For the estimation of the minimum number and peak position of component
bands of water in the deconvoluted region, the first derivative of
the FTIR data and several references24−26 for perfluorinated hydrated
membranes were taken into consideration. In the initial step of curve
fitting, for the lowest RH data to be deconvoluted, all parameters
(peak position, height, and full width at half-maximum) of each component
band were allowed to vary, except for the peak shape was fixed to
Gaussian function. Gaussian function was found to be better for the
best fitting of the component bands. For the deconvolution of all
successive higher RH data, the peak positions of the component bands
were kept constant; however, the height and full width at half-maximum
were allowed to vary.

AIMD Simulation
We have performed
AIMD simulations
of hydrated Nafion for 60% RH using a model system containing 2 Nafion
molecules with 4 terminating sulfonate groups and 17 water molecules,
which is equal to the model used in our previous studies.28,29 All calculations were based on the generalized gradient approximation
in the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof form.30 Separable norm-conserving pseudopotentials were used,31 and only the Γ-point was used to sample
the Brillouin zone. The orbitals were expanded by the adaptive finite
element basis functions at the average cutoff energy of 74 Ry32 and were quenched to the Born–Oppenheimer
surface at each AIMD step. We exploited the mixed precision algorithm
to improve the performance of this procedure.33 Experimental masses were used for all atoms to reproduce the experimental
spectra. The simulation lasted for 50 ps using a time step of 0.726
fs, and the average temperature was 67 °C. Other details of the
simulations are given elsewhere.25,26 The trajectory
of our simulations was used to investigate the structural and vibrational
properties of our model system. In Table 3, we show the probabilities of hydrogen atoms
to take different states defined by the donor and acceptor oxygen
atoms.a We note that all sulfonate groups are
fully dissociated, and thus the donor oxygen is limited to those of
H2O and H3O+. The remaining 1% of
the hydrogen atoms exists in the form of isolated H+. The
vibrational properties are investigated using the power spectra defined
by 6  where Vk(t) denotes the velocity of atom k. Only hydrogen atoms are considered here because our interest is
the high-frequency region of the spectra. In this work, we used a
simple method for decomposing the power spectra into contributions
from different hydrogen states as follows. Let us assume that s denotes the five hydrogen states defined in Table 3. Then, the spectra for state s is given by 7  where wk(s) ∈ [0, 1]
denotes the probability
that atom k takes state s during
the simulations.

a Covalent/hydrogen bonds were determined
by simple distance criteria: if any O–H distance is less than
1.2 Å, the pair is considered to be covalently bonded. If the
distance between the hydrogen atom of the pair and its second nearest
oxygen atom is less than 2.4 Å, these atoms are considered to
be hydrogen-bonded.
