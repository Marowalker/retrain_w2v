There
is a fundamental need for techniques for thin film characterization.
The current options for obtaining infrared (IR) spectra typically
suffer from low signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs) for sample thicknesses
confined to a few nanometers. We present nanomechanical infrared spectroscopy
(NAM-IR), which enables the measurement of a complete infrared fingerprint
of a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) layer as thin as 20 nm with an SNR
of 307. Based on the characterization of the given NAM-IR setup, a
minimum film thickness of only 160 pm of PVP can be analyzed with
an SNR of 2. Compared to a conventional attenuated total reflectance
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) system, NAM-IR
yields an SNR that is 43 times larger for a 20 nm-thick PVP layer
and requires only a fraction of the acquisition time. These results
pave the way for NAM-IR as a highly sensitive, fast, and practical
tool for IR analysis of polymer thin films.

Introduction
The ability to engineer
the chemical and physical properties of
surfaces using dedicated functionalization methods is of fundamental
importance for the advancement in many technological fields, such
as bio and chemical sensing,1 drug delivery,2 tissue engineering,3 solar cells,4 thin films batteries,5 and fabrication of semiconductor devices.6 In recent years, the possibility of engineering
the chemical and physical properties of a surface by applying a thin
polymer film has attracted considerable attention due to its simplicity,
robustness, and flexibility, due to the vast selection of polymer
films.2,3,7−9 Thin polymer films can exhibit confinement-induced, peculiar physicochemical
properties, such as changes in glass transition temperature,10 elastic moduli,11 and crystallization.12 Characterizing
the properties of such thin films is therefore of high relevance both
technologically and scientifically.

The chemical behavior and
structure of thin films are often characterized
by infrared absorption spectroscopy13−16 or other vibrational spectroscopy
techniques such as surface-enhanced Raman Spectroscopy.17 Thin film IR spectroscopy is commonly performed
using attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(ATR-FTIR), with a typical configuration with only one reflection
within the ATR crystal.16,18,19 An issue connected with the use of ATR-FTIR is that the signal-to-noise-ratio
(SNR) degrades quickly when the sample thickness is much smaller than
the penetration depth of the evanescent IR wave of up to 2 μm,13 thereby effectively limiting the thickness range
that can be studied. One possibility to overcome this issue is to
use very long acquisition times,16 but
this restricts the throughput of the analytical system. A multireflection
ATR accessory can also be used to boost the signal, but such an approach
is suitable only when the crystal is in contact with a liquid or the
thin functionalization layer to be studied is irreversibly attached
to the crystal. These drawbacks might represent an issue in terms
of the experimental throughput of ATR-FTIR when a large variety of
thin polymer layers with high spectroscopically precisions have to
be tested. Hence, there is a need for a fast, reliable, and nondestructive
method to analyze thin films.

Infrared reflection–absorption
spectroscopy (IRRAS)20 is used to study
the thin films and needs to
be performed on a reflective substrate.21 Due to the surface selection rule, the phase of the reflected beam
is shifted by an amount that depends on the incident angle, polarization,
and wavelength of the incident light. The resulting spectra contain
information on the molecules’ dipole moment perpendicular to
the surface.21−23 Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that engineered
substrates equipped with antenna-like structures can strongly enhance
the light–matter interaction. These substrates have been used
to monitor nanoparticles and protein interactions.23 Although these approaches have pushed the limit of detection
up to a single-molecule layer, the experimental time frame is extended,
and it can take up to several hours due to the low SNR on a single
acquisition.

Polarization modulation-IRRAS (PM-IRRAS) can overcome
some of the
limitations of IRRAS by improving the low SNR; however, the spectra
are still dependent on the surface selection rules, and the spectra
require a complex postprocessing technique.16,24,25

The combination of atomic force microscopy
(AFM) and infrared spectroscopy
has emerged as a hybrid technique known as AFM-IR, which has shown
to provide a chemical mapping of submicron polymer films.26−30 Although the method can provide accurate spectra and overcome the
spatial resolution issue, the experimental setup needs a fine alignment
of the light sources with the AFM tip, which might limit the throughput
of method and extend the time frames.

Photothermal spectroscopy
methods are based on the transduction
of the temperature change of the sample, induced by the light absorption,
into a signal that can be recorded. Typically, density, pressure,
or temperature changes, induced by the wavelength specific light absorption,
have been exploited to obtain an IR absorption fingerprint of a sample.31−34

In the last 15 years, nanomechanical sensing has been exploited
for biosensing purposes35−39 and material characterization.40,41 In particular,
photothermal nanomechanical IR sensing (NAM-IR) has been developed
for both deflection and resonance frequency detection schemes.32,33,42−49

In the present work, we have used the resonance frequency
detection
scheme.

During the experiment, the membrane oscillates at its
mechanical
natural frequency via the actuation provided by an external piezoelectric
crystal. The mechanical resonance frequency of the resonator is a
function of the mechanical stress, which, in turn, depends on the
local temperature. Changes in temperature, occurring upon light absorption,
detune the resonance frequency of the resonator. Due to the photothermal
effect,31 the absorbed light locally increases
the temperature, which releases a part of the native stress in the
membrane, causing the resonance frequency to drop.50 The changes in the resonance frequency are recorded through
a lock-in detection scheme and a typical experimental setup as illustrated
in Figure 1.The resonance
frequency shifts as a function of the wavelength specific light absorption
represents the NAM-IR spectra.

Figure 1 Sampling procedure and NAM-IR setup. (a)
Polymer deposition method;
(b) NAM-IR spectrometer comprises: a pressure-controlled chamber providing
an optical access from both sides of the sensor, a quantum cascade
laser (QCL, Block Engineering) that generates a monochromatic IR light
in the range from 768–1953 cm–1, an optical
readout system based on a laser Doppler vibrometer (Polytech MSA-500),
a phase lock-in amplifier, and a piezo driver.44,45

Regardless of the detection scheme
used, the samples examined so
far using NAM-IR have been limited to airborne-deposited materials
or liquids. This limitation is due to the lack of mechanical robustness
of previous nanomechanical transducers, such as nanostrings45 and microcantilevers.47 Moreover, such nanomechanical structures suffer from AFM-like readout
laser alignment issues due to their micrometer-range lateral dimensions,
which can drastically limit the final throughput of NAM-IR. Recently,
a filter-like nanomechanical structure51 has been developed to improve the sampling efficiency of airborne
particles. However, the perforated geometry is not suitable for analyzing
thin films. A main advantage of the photothermal spectroscopy is that
it does not suffer from the typical spectral artefacts of ATR-FTIR
or absorbance-reflection techniques in the recorded spectra.13 Moreover, it is insensitive to the IR light
angle or polarization.

Our NAM-IR system used in this work consists
of a thin (100 nm)
square (1 × 1 mm) prestressed (250 MPa) silicon-rich silicon
Nitride (SRN) membrane fabricated by standard silicon micromachining
techniques.

Membrane-like resonators have, intuitively, higher
mechanical robustness
and uniform topography compared to silicon nitride string resonators.
Furthermore, membranes withstand typical surface functionalization
treatments in liquid, including spray coating and spin coating. As
a demonstrator of the capabilities of our NAM-IR system, we analyze
polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) thin films with thicknesses down to 20
nm. PVP polymer thin films have recently attracted much attention
due to their high versatility in drug delivery devices52 and hydrogels,53 where
their physical and chemical properties are crucial. The low thermal
mass of our resonating membranes allows running analysis over a range
of 1100 cm–1 wavenumbers in 30 s with an SNR of
up to 307, even for a polymer film as thin as 20 nm. In Figure 1, our NAM-IR system is illustrated.
It is composed of a vacuum chamber with two apertures, one for the
IR light and one for the readout laser of the vibrometer. A quantum
cascade laser (QCL) is used to generate the stepwise monochromatic
IR light in the range of 768–1953 cm–1 with
a step of 0.5 cm–1.

Results and Discussions
In Figure 2, the
NAM-IR spectra of the PVP thin films are compared to those of the
conventional spectroscopy techniques. The three mid-IR bands of PVP
recorded by NAM-IR match well the spectra recorded by the reference
methods (ATR-FTIR and transmission FTIR) as well as the previously
published results.54 The PVP carbonyl band
appears to be shifted toward a higher frequency when recorded through
NAM-IR compared to the reference techniques such as FTIR or ATR-FTIR.
Photothermal spectroscopy provides a complementary46,55,56 technique to probe IR fingerprints of chemical
bonds. Absorption spectroscopy relies on the Beer–Lambert law.
Instead, NAM-IR relies on the nonradiative decay, which is a complementary
phenomenenon.56 Furthermore, the distortion
of the refractive index occurring upon absorption25 can bias a measured peak toward a lower frequency;25,57 such phenomena can be even more pronounced when the sample is a
submicron film.13 Although correction algorithms
can adjust the relative peak intensities as well as the peak positions,25,57 such methods require an a priori knowledge on the optical properties
of the film sample.

Figure 2 Comparison of the NAM-IR spectrum of a PVP film with respect
to
ATR and FTIR. The three main bands characterize the polymer fingerprint:
the signal at 1300 cm–1 referred to the C–N
bond stretching and the CH2 ring wag mode. The band with
three peaks between 1400 and 1500 cm–1 corresponds
to the CH2 ring wag and the C–N stretching. The
peak at 1680 cm–1 corresponds to the C=O
stretching mode. The spectra of a 500 nm-thick PVP sample are recorded.

In order to maximize the IR spectrum
signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR)
of our photothermal spectrometer, we looked closely at the relation
between the thermal time constant of the membrane resonator, the minimum
settling time of the IR source for each wavelength, and the optimal
signal integration time.

First, the time transient of the resonance
frequency shift of the
membrane sensor upon periodic IR irradiation at a fixed IR wavelength
was characterized, in order to extract the thermal time constant of
the membrane τM.58 As
can be seen in Figure 3a, the mechanical resonance frequency of the membranes decreases
following a first-order exponential decay upon IR absorption. Such
an ON–OFF (or heating and cooling) curve has been acquired
485 times, and each of them was fitted with an exponential decay function,, extracting the corresponding τM. The transient
was evaluated for two different vacuum pressures,
which yielded (for a 20 nm PVP-coated membrane) τM = 4.1 ± 0.08 ms at a low vacuum of 1 mbar and τM = 17 ± 0.9 ms at a high vacuum of 10–5 mbar.
Due to the finite thermal mass of the sensor,42,58 the thermal time constant upon light absorption (heating) is higher
than the cooling time constant. Instead, the difference in the τM value is attributed to the different relative importance
of the heat transport mechanism involved at the two vacuum levels.
In high vacuum and at room temperature, the mean free path of the
gas molecules becomes roughly 10 m, which is significantly larger
than the critical dimension of the nanomechanical resonator. Hence,
the heat transport due to natural convection can be neglected, and
all the heat generated in the membrane is dissipated by conduction
through the body chip alone. Contrary, at 1 mbar, the mean free path
corresponds to roughly 100 μm, which is comparable to the dimensions
of the device, hence, allowing a part of the heat to be dissipated
by conduction through the surrounding gas. Therefore, the two regimes
have different time transient responses. The response time is also
influenced by the thickness of the polymer layer, and the corresponding
values are reported in the Supporting Information. A precise knowledge of the thermal time constant τM is required in order to choose an optimal settling time for each
wavelength emitted by the QCL. The settling time was set such that
the membrane would be exposed for no less than 3× τM for each discrete IR wavelength, in order to ensure that
the membrane reaches the maximum frequency shift at each wavelength
step. Considering that the QCL sweeps 1185 cm–1 with
steps of 0.5 cm–1, the total acquisition time for
a 20 nm-thin polymer layer is only 28.4 s, given a τM value of ∼4 ms in low vacuum.

shift upon periodic light absorption. The
values are recorded on a 200 nm coated membrane at 1 mbar; the shades

(b) Raw NAM-IR spectra. (c) Membrane NAM-IR spectrophotometer can

power throughout the wavelength range and relative temperature reached
during a sweep on a 20 nm PVP-coated membrane in HV. On the right-hand
vertical axis is the relative temperature shift established in the
membrane upon absorption. As a reference value, the baseline temperature
was considered as 293.15 K.

The membranes’ transient thermal constant also influences
the choice of the integration time of the phase-locked loop (PLL)
detection scheme. To correctly follow the resonance frequency shift
upon light absorption for each IR wavelength step, the lock-in amplifier
bandwidth has to be set sufficiently high enough to follow the full
dynamics of the resonance frequency shift determined by τM, but at the same time, a low bandwidth is desirable to reduce
the frequency acquisition noise. The best balance was found by measuring
the Allan deviation of the frequency signal as function of the PLL
integration time59 (see the Supporting Information).

Figure 3b,c shows
the raw data acquired by our setup. The detailed understanding of
the membrane frequency behavior enabled us to clearly resolve each
distinct IR wavelength step of 0.5 cm–1, since the
exponential thermal response of the membrane frequency is clearly
visible, and the signal arrives at the maximum amplitude within each
step.

In this work, the integration time was set to 1.5 ms for
low vacuum
experiments and 7 ms for high vacuum experiments, leading to a resolvable
frequency shift of 2 ppm for a membrane coated with a 20 nm-thin PVP
layer.

Since different polymers,60,61 drugs,62 brush layers,63 and
block coplymers64 can typically present
phase transition temperatures
around room temperature, it is of the highest importance to ensure
the thermal stability of the sample properties during the IR illumination
while the spectrum is recorded. Therefore, for NAM-IR to be a viable
solution for ultrathin organic samples, the increase in sample temperature
during the spectrum acquisition needs to be minimized. By maximizing
the SNR of the overall system, we could minimize the necessary IR
power and therefore achieved a spectrum with an SNR > 200 for a
change
in the sample temperature below 1 K. Despite the importance of the
issue, there has, to the best of our knowledge, been no previously
presented any estimation of the temperature rise due to the IR absorption
for NAM-IR systems. We used an analytical model to estimate the power
absorbed by the membranes.51 Considering
a frequency noise floor of 2 ppm (see the Supporting Information), the minimum power that can be detected is 5 nW
for an integration time of 7 ms and an SNR of 1. Such an absorbed
power corresponds to a local temperature increase in the membrane
center of 3 mK for a 20 nm PVP-coated membrane (see the Supporting Information). In the case of a 20
nm-coated membrane, the maximum absorbed power is 3.5 μW (at
1680 cm–1), which is about 1% of the incident QCL
laser power at that wavelength. Such a power gives rise to a temperature
increase of 0.9 K in the center of the membrane (see the Supporting Information), indicating that an SNR
on the temperature estimation as high as 300 can be achieved. Finally,
a calibrated power absorption spectrum is shown in Figure 3d, where the temperature reached
at the center of the membrane throughout the entire spectrum is shown.
As can be seen, the temperature increases no more than 0.9 K compared
to room temperature. This ensures the noninvasiveness of the technique,
the glass transition temperature of PVP65 being ∼448 K.

Figure 4a,b compares
the NAM-IR spectra with the ATR-FTIR (Perkin–Elmer Spectrum
100) spectra for the PVP sample thicknesses ranging from 20 to 500
nm. For both techniques, the comparison is done with a single-sweep
recording. The signal acquisition parameters and postprocessing techniques
are shown in the Supporting Information. The ATR-FTIR spectra were acquired at 4 and 2 cm–1 resolution; finer resolutions did not provide any reliable results
due to a too low SNR. When ATR-FTIR was used, the three bands of PVP
were clearly visible for sample thicknesses higher than 100 nm, but
only a very broad peak corresponding to the carbonyl frequency at
1680 cm–1 was observable for thinner samples (Figure 4a). Instead, our
NAM-IR spectroscopy reveals all the expected features in the spectra,
resolving clearly the three PVP spectroscopic bands down to a 20 nm
sample thickness, both in low and high vacuum (Figure 4c).

Figure 4 (a) ATR spectra, (b) NAM-IR spectra at 1 mbar,
and (c) close up
of 20 nm PVP layer at 1 and 10–5 mbar and ATR-FTIR
spectra. For the sake of comparison, all the spectra were offset,
and the NAM-IR spectra are represented as absolute values of the resonance
frequency shift.

To compare the performance
of the ATR-FTIR and our NAM-IR system,
SNRs were calculated on the baseline corrected spectra. The noise
was calculated as the standard deviation of the spectra between 1800
and 1953 cm–1, since no light absorption occurs
in this range. As a signal for the calculation of the SNR, we analyzed
the amplitude of the carbonyl peak around 1680 cm–1. For all the examined thicknesses, the SNRs of NAM-IR (Figure 5a,b) were always
at least one order of magnitude higher than the ATR-FTIR values and
up to 43 times higher when compared with the high vacuum recorded
spectra. It is worth to note that the high vacuum measurements, due
to the higher values of the thermal time constants, need a longer
settling time of the QCL source for each wavelength to match the longer
membrane thermal time constant. The SNR of NAM-IR spectroscopy is
nearly independent of the total acquisition time (Figure 5b), as long as the settling
time at each IR wavelength is larger than the membrane thermal time
constant.

Figure 5 (a) Comparison of SNR between NAM-IR spectroscopy and ATR-FTIR
for different thicknesses. (b) SNR of 200 nm PVP-coated membrane for
different acquisition times. The SNR is not sensitive to a prolonged
acquisition time; instead, ATR-FTIR spectrophotometer increments the
SNR for an increased number of scans.

The SNR of the ATR-FTIR spectra depends on the resolution
of the
acquisitions,66 which is typically 4 or
2 cm–1, and the comparisons of the SNRs between
the spectra are made, considering such spectral resolutions. Although
FTIR-based spectrophotometers increase the SNR of spectra by coarsening
the resolution, the spectra acquired at 4 cm–1 on
20 and 40 nm sample thicknesses did not lead to a remarkable difference
regarding the SNR. Considering that the NAM-IR spectra recorded on
a 20 nm-thick PVP layer showed an impressive SNR of 307 in high vacuum,
we are confident that this technique is now capable of recording the
IR spectrum of a single-molecule PVP layer. In fact, extrapolating
the SNR versus thickness relation toward smaller thicknesses (see
the Supporting Information) and considering
an SNR of 2 as the lowest value needed to clearly recognize a spectral
feature of PVP, the limit of detection regarding mass per unit area
for NAM-IR is 0.13 fg/μm2 (femtogram per square micrometer).
This mass per unit area limit corresponds to an equivalent thickness
of 160 pm of PVP, approximately corresponding to 4 attomoles of PVP
spread over the laser spot area (diameter, 100 μm). These data
strongly indicate that single-molecule layers can be probed with NAM-IR,
with very high performances regarding SNR and short acquisition time.

NAM-IR spectroscopy not only outperforms ATR-FTIR in terms of SNR
but potentially also in terms of simplicity in the interpretation
of the spectrum. In fact, another important feature to bear in mind
when comparing our photothermal NAM-IR with an ATR-FTIR spectrometer
regards which vibrational modes can be excited by the IR light in
case the sample is a thin film that presents good molecular ordering.13,16,57 ATR-FTIR probes the surface sample
with the IR beam obliquely oriented to the normal of the sample surface
with a nearly fixed angle. Therefore, the IR radiation is probing
the perpendicular as well as the horizontal (with respect to the surface)
molecular vibrational modes. In this case, the resulting spectra contain
both the information about the horizontal as well as the perpendicular
modes, calling for precautions in the interpretation of spectra from
thin layers ordered at the molecular level. Moreover, the ATR-FTIR
spectra further depend on the reflection occurring at the substrate
and sample interface.13 In fact, when the
sampling depth is higher than the sample thickness, the evanescent
wave is partially reflected by the substrate, leading to an extinction
of the transversal mode and enhancement of the longitudinal ones.13,67 Similar artefacts are also present in adsorption–reflectance-based
systems.16,20 On the other hand, the infrared spectrum
obtained by NAM-IR is not influenced by the distortion of the refractive
index, which would shift the position of the peaks to lower frequencies.
ATR-IR suffers from these artefacts, which need to be corrected through
advanced correction algorithms.57

Thus, the NAM-IR approach is much more flexible, and the IR light
can probe the sample with any angle and any polarization. This flexibility
simplifies the interpretation of the spectra for samples where molecules
follow a specific orientation on the surface, such as self-assembled
monolayers, Langmuir block monolayers, or partially crystallized polymer
layers. A spectrum acquired with the IR light impinging the sample
surface perpendicularly would contain information only on the vibrational
modes that have a component of the dipole moment parallel to the sample
surface. Changing the impinging angle of the IR light, the vibrational
modes with a dipole moment component orthogonally oriented to the
sample surface will also be probed.

These advantages and the
much higher SNR for the sub-50 nm layers
make membrane-based NAM-IR a very strong candidate for a new generation
of single-molecule layer IR spectroscopy tools.

Membrane resonator-based
NAM-IR spectroscopy enabled new possibilities
for performing IR spectroscopy on sub-50 nm organic films. The SNR
of 307 obtained on a 20 nm PVP polymer layer, combined with a detection
limit in the attomole range, positions membrane-based NAM-IR as a
possible technique for a single-molecule layer analysis. The NAM-IR
spectroscopy measurements were performed in less than 30 s on a 20
nm PVP layer, whereas in using a commercial ATR-FTIR technique, the
same SNR would be achieved with an acquisition time 43 times longer
or an SNR 43 times lower. If we consider the acquisition performed
under low vacuum conditions, the SNR is still 25 times higher compared
to that of the commercial ATR-FTIR technique.

Moreover, the
vibrational modes in ordered organic thin layers
can be potentially selectively probed, since the IR light can hit
the surface with virtually any angle, overcoming the effects of the
interaction of the electric field in the case of reflection of the
incident beam at the substrate sample interface.13

In terms of the mechanical robustness, the membranes
comply better
with the experimental conditions typical of the surface functionalization
experiments compared to microstrings or perforated geometries for
airborne particles, allowing the user to prepare the samples in an
ample kind of methods. The high capability to dissipate the heat makes
the response one order of magnitude faster compared to microstrings.43

Finally, the readout of the membrane motion
can be integrated using
a more advanced design, creating a compact yet extremely sensitive,
versatile, and fast IR spectroscopy tool for ultrathin organic layers.

Experimental
Section
Membrane Fabrication
The details of the membrane fabrication
process are described in the Supporting Information.

Sample Preparation
The polymer solution was prepared
by dissolving polyvinylpyrrolidone powder (PVP, Sigma-Aldrich Mw =
360,000) in an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide) (H2O2, 30% w/v) in two different concentrations (1 and 5
wt %). The deposition on the membrane was performed by spin coating:
the solution (4 mL) was poured on a silicon wafer containing the membrane
chip and then spun at various rotational speeds. The sample was allowed
to dry at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Ellipsometry
was used to measure the thickness of the polymer layers. The spinning
curves, standard deviations, and details of the sample preparation
are provided in the Supporting Information.

NAM-IR Spectra Recording
The NAM-IR signal was recorded
through a lock-in scheme. The membrane resonator is placed in a vacuum
chamber that guarantees an optical access from the top and from the
bottom side of the sensor of the membrane. The resonance frequency
of the membrane resonator is probed optically (Polytech MSA-500),
and the infrared light is provided by a tunable quantum cascade laser
(QCL, Block Engineering 768–1953 cm–1) and
collimated by a parabolic mirror on the membrane resonator providing
a laser spot size of 100 μm. A lock-in amplifier records the
frequency shift. The phase detector bandwidth was 500 Hz for the LV
(10–3 mbar) measurement and 200 Hz for the HV (10–5 mbar) measurement, and the sampling rate was set
at 3600 Hz. The thermal time constant was determined by irradiating
the membrane resonator periodically at a certain wavelength as described
elsewhere.58 The IR radiation was mechanically
chopped providing an irradiation time of 50 ms for the LV measurement.
In HV mode, the irradiation time was increased to 250 ms to allow
the membrane to reach the steady value of the resonant frequency shift
at each cycle.

ATR Spectra Acquisition
The ATR
spectra were recorded
with Perkin–Elmer Spectrum 100, providing a constant power
throughout the spectral range of 5 mW. The spectra were acquired in
samples composed of a silicon nitride substrate and a PVP layer, prepared
in the same way as the membrane resonator. The PVP layer is placed
in tight contact with a single reflection ZnSe crystal. The gauge
force of the crystal was set to its optimal value, achieving the highest
signal intensity. For all the spectra, at least three signals were
recorded for each sample thickness. A single acquisition spectrum
is acquired at the spectral resolution of 2 and 4 cm–1. The amplitude of the acquired spectra is then corrected to compensate
the different absorption amplitudes throughout the spectral range
using the built-in function of the software.
