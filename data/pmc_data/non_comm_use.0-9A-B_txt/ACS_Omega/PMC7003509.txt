Photocatalysis
can offer solutions for the transformation of greenhouse
gases, such as methane and carbon dioxide. In the paper, a candidate
for such a photocatalyst is presented, based on a composite of titania
with carbon spheres. The material was obtained using microwave assisted
solvothermal synthesis, enabling good dispersion of titania. The studies
of carbon dioxide and methane adsorption were performed under ambient
pressure and temperatures of 40, 60, and 80 °C. The effect of
temperature increase was less favorable for carbon dioxide than for
methane. Satisfying values of carbon dioxide and methane uptake were
obtained—3.94 mmol CO2/g and 2.77 mmol CH4/g at 40 °C.

1 Introduction
Global warming observed
recently and causing severe weather phenomena
is mainly due to the emission of greenhouse gases. The task of reducing
greenhouse gas emissions, especially carbon dioxide and methane, poses
a great challenge because of their abundance.

At present, the
separation and storage of both gases is performed,
whereas their utilization still needs new approaches and further studies.

Although both carbon dioxide and methane have a negative impact
on climate change, the global warming potential of methane is almost
25 times higher than that of carbon dioxide.1

An ideal solution would be to combine both greenhouse gases,
carbon
dioxide and methane, in a reaction leading to some useful products,
for example, syngas, according to the reaction  

Although the thermodynamics of the reaction
is not favorable, the
issue of process feasibility should be addressed. Catalytic dry reforming
was intensively investigated at the end of the 20th century2 and several processes were proposed to decrease
the high thermodynamic barrier, such as plasma technologies, microwaves
processes, solar thermal aerosol flow reactors, fixed bed reactors
induced with electrical current, and electrochemical and photocatalytic
processes.

Since the last option is the most environmentally
friendly, the
paper proposes a material, which can be applied as a successful photocatalyst
in dry reforming of methane with carbon dioxide.

The effective
photocatalytic reduction of CO2 contains
four main steps:3 CO2 and CH4 adsorption on the photocatalyst surface, electron–hole
pair generation by adsorbing sufficient incident photon energy, electron–hole
pair separation, and CO2 reduction. Recent reports on photocatalytic
dry reforming4−10 have focused on the performance of photocatalytic conversion, without
deeper studies on the first-step adsorption of the reactants—CO2 and CH4. The adsorption of reactants is crucial
because it increases contact of a reactant with the surface and enables
its further transformation. Our paper, focusing on the adsorption
of reactants on the photocatalyst surface, attempts to bridge the
gap. A composite system based on microporous carbon spheres doped
with titania was chosen and produced using a microwave-assisted hydrothermal
method. Such composites are innovative and have not been reported
in the literature up to now.

The research hypothesis was based
on the fact that microporosity
of carbon spheres should be favorable for both reactants’ adsorption
and micropores would play the role of microreactors in the next step—photocatalytic
process. As titania is well known to be an efficient photocatalyst,
decoration of carbon spheres with titania would be appropriate for
future photocatalytic processes. Additionally, the positive impact
of the synergy of both composite components on the photocatalyst performance
can be expected. There are some recent literature reports about various
modifications of titania materials applied for photocatalytic conversion
of CO2 and CH4. Typical surface modifications
are metal deposition, alkali modification, carbon-based material loading,
heterojunction construction, or impurity doping.3 A positive effect of the presence of Ti3+ sites
and oxygen vacancies was reported,6 strongly
enhancing visible-light absorption and decreasing band gap energy.
It was mentioned by Low3 that the formation
of Ti3+ sites on the surface was beneficial for binding
of CO2 and separation of electron and hole pairs. A significant
presence of Ti3+ was confirmed by electron paramagnetic
resonance with coefficient geff. from
1.948 to 1.959 and oxygen vacancies.11,12

According
to the previous studies of our group, hybrid graphene
(or graphene oxide) nanocomposites with TiO2 may affect
suppression of recombination or charge-carrier trapping. To investigate
the phenomenon, we utilized the time resolve microwave conductivity
method.13

In the present study, graphitic
carbon spheres were prepared with
oxygen groups on the surface, containing titania, as a future potential
photocatalyst in dry reforming of methane. The idea is based on our
preliminary positive results of the preparation of carbon spheres
for CO2 sorption.14,15

Porous carbon
materials are well known as efficient adsorbents
of greenhouse gases because of their high surface area, microporosity,
and mechanical and chemical stability. Their remarkable adsorption
toward not only carbon dioxide16−18 but also methane19−21 has been widely investigated. Among porous carbon materials, carbon
spheres provide uniform nanoscale shape of the material. The spherical
shape of carbon materials can provide a better interface between the
adsorbent and adsorbed material on the surface of the material. Additionally,
carbon materials are open to modifications; thus, their extraordinary
surface properties can be combined with the properties of other elements
through doping carbon materials with functional elements such as N,22−24 Fe,25,26 and S.27

TiO2 is one of the most commonly known photocatalysts
and offers inexpensive and sustainable (environmentally friendly)
removal of water and air pollution. By combining porous carbon materials
with TiO2, an efficient adsorbent with high photocatalytic
activity can be obtained. There are many papers about preparation
methods based on doping TiO2 on the surface of commercial
activated carbons28,29 or using the high energy-demanding
chemical vapor deposition method and benzene as the carbon source.30 Herein, we report a preparation method based
on the low-temperature Stöber method, which allows us to tune
the material physicochemical properties.14,31

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Morphology
The morphology of pure
carbon spheres and the produced composites was assessed using scanning
electron microscopy (SEM). Their images are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 SEM images of pure carbon
spheres [sample RF 700, (a)] and the
composite of carbon spheres with titania [sample RF + Ti 700, (b)].

Comparing the images in Figure 1a,b, it can be stated that in both cases,
very uniform
carbon spheres were formed. Then, the addition of titania did not
affect the morphology of the material. The mean diameter of the spheres
increased following doping with titania. The average diameter of the
obtained pure carbon spheres was about 570 nm, whereas that of the
spheres with titania was about 800 nm (an increase of roughly 40%).
The growth of diameter can be explained by an increasing number of
crystallization nucleoli for the forming resin—the titania
particles were the nucleation centers.

There are many literature
reports about carbon–titania composites
in which the surface of the carbon material is decorated with TiO2. The use of the Stöber method resulted in high dispersion
of titania in the carbon matrix. It was proved using energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) technique (Table 1), showing a homogeneous distribution of titania nanoparticles
in the whole volume of the material, within the assumed elemental
composition. According to the mapping shown in Figure 2, a uniform distribution of all elements—carbon,
oxygen, and titanium—can be observed.

O	11.3	9.6

According to the transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) studies,
the diameter of spheres was similar to that observed in the SEM images
(about 800 nm for the composite sample). At higher magnification (Figure 3a), neither typical
carbonaceous structures nor titania crystallites could be observed.
The image can correspond to a thin layer of titania on the surface
of carbon spheres. The layer can be composed of amorphous titania
or very small titania crystallites. For comparison, the TEM image
of the pure carbon sample is shown in Figure 3b. Some multidomain disordered structures
can be observed here. No typical graphite ordering can be seen.

carbon spheres doped with titania (a) and the image
of pure carbon spheres (b).

The results of the mapping of the composite sample are shown in Figure 4. A sphere in the
down right corner was analyzed (Figure 4a). A uniform distribution of the elements (O, Ti,
and C) can be seen (Figure 4c–f). In the magnified image of the sphere (Figure 4b), an agglomeration
of particles can be observed, marked with a red arrow. It corresponds
to the agglomeration of titania particles, as can be concluded from
titanium Ti–K mapping (Figure 4e).

(e) Ti–K, and (f) C–K.

2.2 X-ray Diffraction
The X-ray diffraction
(XRD) pattern of the produced composite is shown in Figure 5. An increase in the background
level in the area of low diffraction angles can be due to the presence
of amorphous titania and/or carbon in the sample. The major peaks
at 25.2, 37.8, 48, and 62.5° were assigned to the anatase phase
of TiO2.32,33 Only one peak at 27.5° can
be ascribed to the rutile phase. Then, in the produced composite,
the anatase phase was the dominating one, which is a big advantage
in terms of photoactivity. Generally, the anatase phase (band gap
≈ 3.2 eV) is more active than the rutile phase (band gap ≈
3.0 eV), but commercial photocatalysts contain both phases.34,35

diffractogram of the RF + Ti 700 sample.

2.3 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
The quantitative
evaluation of the surface of the RF + Ti 700 sample
indicates that carbon atoms constitute about 95% of all atoms detected
by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis (hydrogen was not
observed). The rest consists of oxygen (3 at. %) and nitrogen (2 at.
%). This result proves a high degree of carbonization of the sample.
Titanium was not detected by XPS on the surface of the sample.

In Figure 6, an XPS
spectrum of C 1s transition is presented. The maximum of the C 1s
peak is located at 284.5 eV. The maximum position is characteristic
for elemental carbon but not for the pure graphite, which usually
produces the XPS C 1s spectrum shifted toward lower binding energy
(usually about 284.3 eV).36 Therefore,
it is supposed that carbon atoms form mainly sp3 bonds.

700 sample.

2.4 Specific
Surface Area and Porosity
Nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms at −196 °C
of pure carbon spheres and composite samples are presented in Figure 7. A higher volume
of adsorbed nitrogen was observed for the pure carbon material; then,
doping with titania caused some decrease in porosity. Both isotherms
were a type I and type III mixture, typical for microporous solids.37

Figure 7 Adsorption–desorption isotherms of nitrogen at
−196
°C for pure carbon and composite samples.

The specific surface area was determined using the multipoint Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
method with N2 adsorption isotherms over a relative pressure
(P/P0). The total pore
volume, including micropores and mesopores, was estimated by converting
the amount of N2 gas adsorbed at a relative pressure of
0.9 to the liquid volume of the adsorbate (N2). The micropore
volume was determined using density functional theory. The results
are shown in Table 2. The addition of titanium IV isopropylate caused a slight decrease
in the specific surface area of the material. Nevertheless, the values
of the total pore volume of both tested samples were similar.

Table 2 Physicochemical Properties of the
Samples
sample	SBET(m2/g)	total pore volume (cm3/g)	micropore volume (cm3/g)	density (g/cm3)	CO2 adsorption at 0 °C, 1 at. (mmol/g)	CO2 adsorption at 25 °C, 1 at. (mmol/g)	
RF 700	444	0.25	0.21	1.79	3.25	2.43	
RF + Ti 700	432	0.24	0.20	1.83	3.19	2.03	
Because low temperature nitrogen adsorption is effectively used
mainly to determine mesopores above 2 nm, the obtained results should
be treated only as an approximation, and the adsorption of carbon
dioxide described in the next part of the paper will shed more light
on the presence of micropores, thanks to the smaller kinetic diameter
of the carbon dioxide molecule.

The adsorption capacity is a
function of the surface area but also
of the surface chemistry and microporosity of the material. For CO2 adsorption, pores below 1 nm are the most important.38Figure 8 shows the pore size distribution of the obtained samples.
In both cases, large peaks below 0.7 nm were detected. According to
Yin et al.,39 such a size of pores has
significant influence on CO2 uptake at 273.0–293.0
K at a PCO2 of 0.01–0.10 MPa. Furthermore,
Presser et al.40 reported that pores below
0.8 nm are mainly responsible for CO2 uptake at 273 K and
0.1 MPa. A significant weakening of the peak at 0.85 nm can be noticed
for the sample containing TiO2. This observation is very
important due to the role of micropores in adsorption of small gas
molecules.

2.5 Greenhouse Gas Adsorption
Studies
2.5.1 Adsorption of Methane
The studies
on adsorption of carbon dioxide and methane were performed on pure
carbon spheres, on pure titania, and on the composite of titania–carbon
spheres. The isotherms of adsorption–desorption of methane
on these materials are presented in Figure 9 (carbon spheres) and Figure 10 (composite). The adsorption of methane
on carbon spheres occurred (about three times) more efficiently than
on titania (not shown here). The composite demonstrated similar (a
little bit lower) adsorption capacity to pure carbon spheres. Some
decrease of the adsorption capacity on the composite can be explained
by the influence of titania addition as the yield of adsorbed methane
on pure titania was much lower. However, some differences in behavior
could be observed—in the case of the pure carbon material,
there was almost no hysteresis at higher (60 and 80 °C) temperature,
so all adsorbed methane desorbed. In the case of titania and composite
samples, a hysteresis could be observed (some volume of methane remained
in the pores during desorption).

Figure 9 CH4 adsorption–desorption
isotherms on pure carbon
spheres (sample RF 700).

Figure 10 CH4 adsorption–desorption
isotherms on composite
titania–carbon spheres.

The optimistic conclusion from the results shown above can be that
an increase in temperature caused only a weak decrease in the adsorption
ability of methane, which is prospective for practical applications.
The shape of the isotherms and the methane uptake level are similar
for pure carbon spheres and the composite (higher methane uptake than
pure titania). It can be then concluded that in the case of the titania–carbon
sphere composite, adsorption of methane occurred mainly on carbonaceous
structures.

2.5.2 Adsorption of Carbon
Dioxide
To
evaluate the rate of carbon dioxide adsorption on the produced composite,
a kinetic test was performed using a thermogravimetric analyzer. The
results are presented in Figure 11. The adsorption was fast as the steady state was reached
after about 15 min only.

Figure 11 Thermogravimetric analysis curves for the CO2 adsorption–desorption
cycles.

The experimental results were
kinetically presented by a pseudo-first-order
kinetic model  where a* and a (mmol/g)
are the adsorption capacities at equilibrium and at time t, respectively, and k is the kinetic rate
constant. After integration with boundary conditions t = 0 to t = t and a = 0 to a = a, the following equations
were obtained:    

The results obtained using the pseudo-first-order kinetic
model
are shown in Table 3 and in Figure 12. The differences between the pure carbon and composite samples were
negligible. A good correlation between experimental results and the
model was obtained.

We have recently studied carbon dioxide adsorption
on various types
of titania. The adsorption capacity at ambient temperature was rather
low, although an increase was observed after a surface treatment,
which boosted its basicity. For crude titania,40 the adsorption of CO2 reached only 0.06 mmol
CO2/g at 30 °C, but after treatment of the material
with NH4OH and KOH, it increased ca. 9 times (to 0.53 mmol
CO2/g).41 The TiO2/N material synthesized by hydrothermal reaction of amorphous anatase
and NH4OH at 100 °C was active in the photocatalytic
reduction of chemisorbed carbon dioxide to methanol in a water solution.42 A similar behavior was observed for TiO2 nanorods obtained from an alkali solution and modified with
amines.43 The modification with amines
[tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA)] resulted in a considerable increase
of CO2 uptake in comparison with raw materials, that is.
from 0.72 mmol CO2/g to 3.02 mmol CO2/g at 30
°C. The prepared samples were stable up to 150 °C and tested
in multiple (6) adsorption–desorption cycles, without any performance
deterioration. Interesting results were obtained from CO2 adsorption on titanate–TiO2 composites44 modified with TEPA—in the range of 25–80
°C with increasing temperature, an increase of CO2 uptake was observed from 2 mmol CO2/g at 25 °C to
3.11 mmol CO2/g at 80 °C. This unusual phenomenon
indicates chemisorption of CO2 on such materials, which
is very promising for photocatalytic CO2 reduction at the
hole sites of TiO2.

The results of CO2 uptake measurements at 0 and 25 °C
under atmospheric pressure on the samples produced within the study
are presented in the last columns of Table 2. Doping of carbon spheres with titania caused
a slight decrease in CO2 uptake, from 3.25 to 3.19 at 0
°C and from 2.43 to 2.03 at 25 °C. The value of carbon dioxide
uptake at 25 °C on the titania–carbon spheres composite
was similar to that previously reported for titanate–TiO2 composites.44

It can be
concluded that carbon dioxide adsorption occurred both
on titania and carbon structures. It is a positive prognostic for
the potential photocatalyst in which titania will contribute to the
generation of electron–hole pairs and carbonaceous structures
will suppress recombination or charge-carrier trapping.

Adsorption
measurement results of carbon dioxide on pure carbon
spheres and composite titania–carbon spheres at various temperatures
are shown in Figures 13 and 14, respectively.

Figure 13 CO2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms on carbon
spheres.

Figure 14 CO2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms on composite
titania–carbon spheres.

Doping of carbon spheres with titania caused a decrease in carbon
dioxide uptake, in particular, at higher temperature (60 and 80 °C).
Nevertheless, doping with titania is recommended for further application
of the material as a photocatalyst in dry reforming of methane with
carbon dioxide. A temperature of 40 °C should be optimal for
the efficient adsorption of both greenhouse gases.

3 Materials and Methods
Preparation of the TiO2–carbon composite was
based on the Stöber method. The process was assisted by microwaves;
thus the heat in the reaction volume was evenly distributed, which
improved the quality of the obtained products. Resorcinol–formaldehyde
resin was used as a carbon source. First, 0.6 g of resorcinol was
dissolved in a mixture of 60 mL of distilled water and 24 mL of ethanol.
Then, 0.19 mL of titanium IV isopropylate was added to the solution
with continuous stirring in ambient conditions. The titanium–carbon
weight ratio was 1:10. Afterward, 0.3 mL of ammonia and 0.9 mL of
formaldehyde were added. The solution was stirred for 24 h and then
transferred into an ERTEC MAGNUM II solvothermal microwave reactor
at a pressure of 2 MPa for 15 min. Subsequently, the obtained mixture
was dried at 80 °C for 2 days. The carbonization process was
conducted in an argon atmosphere at 350 °C for 2 h at a heating
rate of 1 °C/min and then, the temperature was raised to 700
°C with the same heating rate and the sample was kept at the
final temperature for 2 h. Finally, the carbonized material was washed
with distilled water and dried at 80 °C for 48 h. The composite
sample was named “RF + Ti 700”, while the reference
sample without titania was labeled “RF 700”.

The
morphology of the produced samples was determined using a Hitachi
SU8020 ultrahigh resolution field emission scanning electron microscope.
TEM images were recorded using an FEI Tecnai F20 microscope.

The phase composition was determined using the XRD method. The
phase composition of the prepared samples was studied with XRD using
Cu Kα radiation (λCu Kα = 0.1540
nm) on an Empyrean, PANalytical. Identification of the crystalline
phases was accomplished using HighScore+ software and the ICDD PDF-4+
2015 database.

The chemical composition of the samples’
surface was studied
by XPS. The measurements were conducted using Mg Kα (hν = 1253.6 eV) radiation in a Prevac (Poland) system
equipped with a Scienta (Sweden) SES 2002 electron energy analyzer
operating with constant transmission energy (Ep = 50 eV). The analysis chamber was evacuated to a pressure
below 1 × 10–9 mbar. A powdered sample of the
material was placed on a stainless steel sample holder.

To determine
the textural properties of the carbon spheres, low
temperature physical adsorption of nitrogen was carried out at −196
°C using a Quadrasorb volumetric apparatus (Quantachrome Instruments).

Carbon dioxide and methane adsorption isotherms were recorded at
temperatures from ambient to 80 °C using a Sieverts IMI-HTP volumetric
analyzer from Hiden Isochema Corporation.

The kinetics of carbon
dioxide adsorption was studied using a thermogravimetric
analyzer (Netzsch STA 449 C). The sample (9.92 mg) was placed in a
sample pan and the temperature was raised from ambient to 30 °C,
under the flow of nitrogen (30 mL/min) and then carbon dioxide (30
mL/min), until the steady state was reached. The same thermogravimetric
apparatus was used to study thermal stability of the samples.

The choice of temperature range for adsorption measurements was
driven by the future use of fabricated materials as sorbents of carbon
dioxide from postcombustion hot gases. Deeper cooling of postcombustion
gases would lead to a significant increase in costs of an industrial
process and would make the sorbents less attractive. Then, adsorption
experiments of carbon dioxide and methane at ambient and above-ambient
temperatures were conducted, even if the tests were much longer than
those at lower temperatures.

Prior to each adsorption measurement,
samples were degassed using
vacuum at 250 °C for 16 h.

4 Conclusions
A new composite based on graphitic carbon spheres and titania was
successfully synthesized using a microwave assisted solvothermal reactor.
Good adsorption properties of the produced material toward methane
and carbon dioxide predestine it to be used as a potential photocatalyst
in dry reforming of these components, in which titania will contribute
to the generation of electron–hole pairs and the role of carbonaceous
structures would be also to diminish the recombination or charge-carrier
trapping. Methane adsorption occurred mainly on carbon structures,
while carbon dioxide was adsorbed both on titania and carbon sites.
The optimum temperature for adsorption of both greenhouse gases on
the titania–carbon sphere composite is about 40 °C. An
open hysteresis loop indicated strong interaction of gases with the
composite surface, contrary to the behavior of pure titania.
