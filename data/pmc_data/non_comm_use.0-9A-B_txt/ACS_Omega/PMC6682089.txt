The major challenge
in photodynamic therapy (PDT) is to discover
versatile photosensitizers (PSs) that possess good solubility in biological
media, enhanced singlet oxygen generation efficacy, and photodynamic
activity. Working in this direction, we synthesized a picolylamine-functionalized
porphyrin conjugate, compound 1, and its zinc complex
compound 2. Compound 1 forms spherical structures
in methanol, whereas compound 2 exhibited vesicular structures.
Compared to the existing PSs like foscan and photofrin, compound 2 exhibited a high singlet oxygen generation efficiency and
triplet quantum yield. The complex also showed good water solubility,
and its PDT activity was demonstrated through in vitro studies using
MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells. The mechanism of biological activity
evaluated using various techniques proved that the active compound 2 induced predominantly singlet oxygen-triggered apoptosis-mediated
cancerous cell death. Our results demonstrate that zinc insertion
in the picolyl porphyrin induces an enhanced triplet excited state,
and the singlet oxygen yields quantitatively and imparts excellent
in vitro photodynamic activity, thereby demonstrating their pertinence
as a nanodrug in future photobiological applications.

Introduction
Cancer is a group of
diseases involving abnormal growth of cells
which tend to invade in an uncontrolled way and will eventually affect
human life. According to the World Health Organization, by the year
2035 cancer will form a global “tidal wave” and will
swallow 24 million people’s life. To date, many attempts were
carried out globally to improve the cancer treatment techniques. Compared
to traditional cancer treatments like surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy,
and so forth, photodynamic therapy (PDT) remains well chosen as an
emerging modern technique because it significantly reduces side effects
and improves target specificity.1 This
treatment modality involves the combined effect of light and a chemical
substance called a photosensitizer (PS). The PS together with molecular
oxygen generates highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) which results
in the elimination of cancerous cells.2 A group of sensitizers mainly based on porphyrins, phthalocyanines,
BODIPY, chlorins, squaraines, methylene blue, and so forth have been
evaluated for photodynamic treatment as they generate singlet oxygen
effectively.3−5 Even though the discovery of PSs such as foscan,
photofrin that are currently in cancer clinics has been considered
as landmarks in the history of PDT, these sensitizers possess certain
drawbacks like low singlet oxygen productivity, poor water solubility,
as well as photosensitivity. For the last few decades, the key problem
in the field of PDT has been to overcome the disadvantages of the
existing PSs and to invent new functionalized PSs that exhibit enhanced
singlet oxygen generation efficiency, solubility in biological media,
and high photodynamic efficacy.6−8

Development of functionalized
porphyrins possessing nanoscale dimensions
has been an interesting research topic as these materials could find
various applications ranging from artificial light harvesting systems
to therapeutic agents in the biomedical field.9−14 Among these, the synthesis of the porphyrin arrays in the nanometric
size possesses the most challenging aspect because their synthesis,
growth of size, and complexity render their development tedious and
inefficient. Interestingly, the supramolecular self-assembly being
a versatile alternative technique, offers the quick construction of
one, two, and three dimensional nanometric architectures having discrete
structure, property, and functionalities.15−19 Recently, nanotechnology has taken the lead to extensively
enhance the photodynamic activity in cancer treatment. The self-assembly
of porphyrins remains as a successful process till date as it self-associates
in the solution through weak intermolecular forces. Such weak forces
render flexibility to the self-assembled nanostructures providing
control over their size as well as geometry which is important in
terms of sustaining suitable host molecules such as dyes or drugs
within these structures.20,21 These porphyrins when
activated by a light stimuli can actively produce smart agents like
singlet oxygen which could have the potential to destroy the cancerous
cells without affecting the normal cells.16 In this context, the development of functionalized porphyrin, which
can form nanostructures that can hold guest molecules with significant
singlet oxygen efficiency, photostability, and good solubility in
the biological medium is quite demanding for their photodynamic therapeutic
applications and plays a key role in drug delivery. Of late, our group
has been a part of developing efficient PSs based on aza-BODIPYS,
squaraines, and porphyrin systems for PDT.22−24

Herein,
we report a porphyrin compound 1, modified
with picolylamine groups and its zinc complex compound 2. We successfully enhanced the intersystem crossing efficiency as
well as water solubility of the porphyrin conjugate through zinc metal
ion insertion both in the core and in the periphery. The compound 2 has the ability to undergo self-assembly to form vesicles
in methanol whereas the ligand forms spherical structures. Further,
we have evaluated the photodynamic efficacy of the compound 2 employing in vitro studies using MDAMB 231 breast cancer
cells. These studies revealed that the compound 2 with
five zinc metal ions showed better photocytotoxicity when compared
to compound 1. The mechanism of biological activity associated
with this PS has been evaluated by FACS analysis, chromatin condensation,
tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) assay, PARP cleavage, and
cytochemical staining methods which indicate that the most active
porphyrin compound 2 could effectively destroy the cancerous
cells through predominantly the apoptotic pathway.

Results and Discussion
We synthesized porphyrin compounds 1 and 2 employing the modified Lindsey’s method and they were characterized
through various spectral as well as analytical methods (Scheme 1, Figures S1 and S2 Supporting Information).25 The compound 1 showed a porphyrin chromophoric Soret
absorption band at 416 nm followed by Q bands in the near-infrared
region. In contrast, compound 2 showed a red-shifted
band at 423 nm and relatively weak bands at 555–600 nm. Fluorescence
spectra of the porphyrin compound 1 exhibited a maximum
at 650 nm whereas the zinc complex compound 2 showed
emission maxima at 610 and 655 nm having a fluorescence quantum yield
of (ΦF) 0.026 ≤ 0.09 for these derivatives
(Figure S3, Supporting Information).26 Among the synthesized porphyrin compounds, compound 2 exhibited good solubility in aqueous media.

Scheme 1 Picolyl
Porphyrin Derivatives Compound 1 and 2
We were interested to develop
the nanostructures of these porphyrin
derivatives by varying the solvent polarity. Interestingly, we found
out that the porphyrin compounds 1 and 2 forms different self-assembled structures in methanol. The morphological
analysis of the nanostructures formed from the compounds 1 and 2 were carried out using different microscopic
techniques like AFM (atomic force microscopy), SEM (scanning electron
microscopy), TEM (transmission electron microscopy), and DLS (dynamic
light scattering). The compound 1, which does not possess
zinc metal ions, forms uniform spheres with a size of 500 ± 50
nm, whereas the compound 2 showed formation of highly
stable vesicular structures in methanol with an average size of 250
± 50 nm (Figure 1). The formation of the vesicular structures was further evidenced
through the DLS experiments, zeta potential, and AFM analysis (Figures
S4 and S9 Supporting Information).

in methanol.

Further, we were interested
to understand the PDT efficacy of the
self-assembled nanostructures formed from the porphyrin compounds 1–2. The nanosecond laser flash photolysis technique
was performed in order to establish the transient intermediates formed
by the compounds. We monitored the transient absorption spectra of 1–2 after laser pulse excitation (λex 355 nm) which showed an absorption maximum at 440 and 470 nm with
bleach at the ground state absorption region. The transient intermediate
of these compounds showed a first-order process having a lifetime
of 10–12 μs and these were confirmed by saturating the
solutions with molecular oxygen. To quantify the triplet excited state
quantum yields (ΦT) of 1–2, we
followed a triplet–triplet energy transfer method by using
[Ru(by)3]2+ as the standard and β-carotene
as the energy acceptor.27 We quantified
the triplet quantum yield of 0.64 ± 0.03 for the compound 1, whereas a quantum yield of 0.97 ± 0.02 was observed
for the compound 2 (Figures 2 and S5, Supporting Information).

excitation at 355 nm) recorded at (a) 0.126, (b) 0.926, (c) 2, (d)
3.2, and (e) 11.5 μs. (B) The transient decay spectrum of 2 at 460 nm.

Further, we were intrigued to analyze the efficacy of photosensitized
singlet oxygen generation by the compounds 1–2, as singlet oxygen plays a key role in photodynamic activity. To
quantify the singlet oxygen generation efficiency, we used both luminescence
and chemical trap methods. In the chemical trap method, we used 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran
(DPBF) as the singlet oxygen trapping agent, whereas in the luminescence
method, we monitored the singlet oxygen luminescence at 1273 nm.28 In the DPBF-trap method, we irradiated compound 1 in methanol after adding DPBF using a mercury lamp (200
W) having a long pass filter (515 nm) for 0–60 s. We monitored
the decrease in absorbance at 414 nm, which corresponds to the dye
(1)-sensitized photo-oxidation of DPBF. From the graph,
the decrease in absorbance of DPBF against irradiation time, we calculated
the singlet oxygen quantum yields by comparing optically matched solutions
of the standard, hematoporphyrin (Hp).29 Similar experiments were carried out for the zinc complexes 2. We observed a singlet oxygen generation efficacy of ca.
0.50 and 0.92 for the compound 1 and 2,
respectively (Figures 3 and S6 Supporting Information).

in methanol for 0–60 s (time interval;
10 s); λirr = 515 nm (LP). (B) Difference in absorbance
of DPBF vs irradiation time with compound 2 and hematoporphyrin
(Hp), the standard.

To further confirm the quantum yields of the singlet oxygen
produced,
we measured the characteristic emission of singlet oxygen in the NIR
region at 1273 nm employing a steady state method using a spectrofluorimeter
connected with a xenon lamp and NIR detector. The singlet oxygen generations
(ΦΔ) were quantified from the emission intensities of 1–2 and the reference compound Hp. For
the compound 1 without any zinc ions, we obtained a singlet
oxygen quantum yield of 0.59 ± 0.02. It is interesting to note
that the compound 2 having Zn2+ metal ions
showed a singlet oxygen quantum yield of 0.95 ± 0.03 and these
results were in absolute agreement with the chemical trap method.
These results lucidly indicate that by incorporating the zinc ions
at suitable positions of the porphyrin ligand, we could enhance the
singlet oxygen generation efficiency because of the increased spin–orbit
coupling interactions (Figure S7 Supporting Information). Interestingly, singlet oxygen generation efficiency and triplet
quantum yield of compound 2 was found to be higher than
the currently existing PSs such as foscan and photofrin.

Investigation
of in Vitro Photobiological Properties
To evaluate the photodynamic
efficacy of the porphyrin nanostructures
of 1–2, first we employed photocytotoxicity studies
using three different cancer cell lines such as breast (MDA-MB-231), cervical (SiHa), and colon (SW 620). As a standard colorimetric
assay for determining cellular proliferation, we employed 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT). MTT is yellow in color, which is reduced to purple
formazan by cellular reductase enzymes present in living cells. The
effectiveness of the PS to inhibit the biological function of tumor
cells can be quantified by measuring the absorbance of formazan formed
in the region 500–600 nm. The IC50 value, which
is a direct measurement of cytotoxicity of a sensitizer, was calculated
under different cases such as dark and light conditions. We had screened
both PSs in the three cell lines under similar conditions and the
growth inhibition percentage of cells in the presence of compound 1–2 with and without irradiation is shown in Figure 4. Among the three
cancer cell lines, MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cell line showed the least
photocytotoxicity of 12 and 7 μM for compound 1 and 2, respectively,
which stands ideal for potent PSs compared to other cell lines. Cytotoxic
studies revealed that both PSs are essentially noncytotoxic in the
absence of light but interestingly upon light activation it showed
high photocytotoxicity. It is apparent that compound 2 having zinc ions showed better photocytotoxicity than compound 1 in all the three cell lines. It is interesting to note that
compound 2 having zinc metal ions has been identified
as a lead molecule because it exhibits significant photophysical properties
and photocytotoxicity. Therefore, we investigated the detailed photobiological
activity pertaining to lead porphyrin 2 to understand
the mechanism underlying its biological activity.

cytotoxicity of the compound 1 and 2 in
light (A,B) and the dark (C,D) in MDA MB 231
(red), SiHa (blue), and SW 620 (pink) cell lines showing the percentage
growth inhibition upon irradiation using Waldmann PDT 1200 L (570
nm, 50 mJ/cm2, 15 min).

To understand the localization of compound 2 and cellular
uptake in MDA-MB 231 cells, we employed confocal microscopy technique.
It was interesting to observe that when MDA-MB 231 cell lines were
incubated with 7 μM of 2, the cells readily showed
an uptake of the sensitizer within 1 h. The localization of 2 was confirmed by Hoechst dye as the counter stain (Figure 5). The merged images
of the MDA MB 231 cells with both compound 2 and Hoechst
dye at different conditions showed intense and punctate fluorescence
outside the nucleus indicating its presumed cytoplasmic association.

fluorescence in MDA-MB-231 cells after treatment with 2 (7 μM). Merged image showing MDA-MB-231 cell nucleus with a vital nuclear dye DAPI (blue) and 2 (red).

To unravel the mechanism behind
the PDT activity and cellular damage
induced by compound 2, we evaluated the Annexin V-FITC/PI
assay using the flow cytometric analysis. Annexin V (tagged with FITC)
has a high affinity for phosphatidylserine (which is present on the
inner leaflet of the plasma membrane). Upon initiation of apoptosis
phosphatidylserine on the inner leaflet is translocated to the outer
leaflet allowing its binding and thereby serving as a sensitive probe
to identify apoptotic cells.30 Generally
Annexin V-FITC is used in combination with propidium iodide (PI),
another fluorophore, to differentiate viable and dead cells. An intact
membrane prevents PI from binding to the nucleic acid content and
thereby distinguishes apoptotic and necrotic cells (Figure 6).

Figure 6 Flow cytometric analysis
of MDA-MB 231 cells after PDT treatment
with 2. (A) Light control, (B) dark control, and in the
presence of 2, (C) 3.5, (D) 7 μM. The viable cells
in the lower left quadrant of each panel show negative for Annexin
V-FITC/PI, whereas apoptotic cells in the upper right quadrants show
positive for Annexin V-FITC/PI.

We observed that most cells showed no apoptotic and necrotic
changes
upon PDT treatment with 2 (7 μM) in the absence
of light suggesting it to be nontoxic for normal cells. This indicates
that compound 2 were noncytotoxic towards the MDA-MB-231 cells in the absence of light. However, upon photo-irradiation,
the percentage of cells at the lower right quadrant (Q4), that is,
in the early apoptotic stage (i.e., externalization of phospholipid
phosphatidylserine but not membrane leakage, Annexin V-FITC+/PI−)
increased from 12.5 to 51.3%, when the concentration of compound 2 increased from 3.5 to 7 μM. These results clearly
depict that the porphyrin conjugate 2 induces cancer
cell death predominantly through the apoptosis mechanism.

Cell
death by apoptosis was further evaluated by employing the
TMRM staining experiment by fluorescence imaging. The PDT of MDA-MB-231 cells with compound 2 at 3.5 μM
resulted in about 28% reduction in membrane potential, whereas at
7 μM, 64% reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential was
observed. Alternatively, the light and dark controls showed only 7
and 9% decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential. These observations
confirm that compound 2 induces cell death during the
PDT treatment mainly through the apoptotic pathway (Figure 7A).

Figure 7 (A) TMRM assay, (B) chromatin
condensation, and (C) acridine orange/ethidium
bromide (AO/EB) assay, with MDA-MB-231 cell lines, each
panel showed the cells under light control and dark control, after
PDT treatment of porphyrin conjugate 2 at 3.5 and 7 μM.

Further, we confirmed the membrane
damage through the chromatin
condensation technique using fluorescence imaging with Hoechst.31−34 Hoechst could stain only the viable cells resulting in blue fluorescence
and the membrane damage can be easily monitored through the decrease
in fluorescence. It was found that MDA-MB-231 cells showed
22% chromatin condensation after PDT with compound 2 at
3.5 μM, whereas it showed a 56% decrease in fluorescence at
7 μM. In contrast, in light and dark controls only 11.5 and
12% chromatin condensation was observed, respectively, which clearly
indicated a gradual concentration dependent elimination of cancerous
cells due to the PDT activity of the porphyrin conjugate 2 (Figure 7B).

Another hallmark study on apoptosis is that it employs the cytochemical
double staining method using AO and EB. The apoptotic cells and the
condensed nuclei are stained selectively by EB (red), whereas the
control cells had only taken up AO (green). This could be clearly
evidenced from the lower panels shown in Figure 7C. PDT with 2 in MDA-MB-231 cells at 3.5 μM resulted in about 8% EB staining. At 7 μM
of compound 2, we observed 72% EB staining, whereas in
light and dark controls only 1 and 1.5% staining was observed respectively.
The double staining method using compound 2 revealed
that it could effectively induce apoptosis through cell membrane permeabilization
and chromatin condensation.

ROS-mediated cell death has been
widely attributed to be associated
with PDT. Hence, we were interested to study the cellular oxidative
stress in complex 2-based PDT using a 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein
diacetate acetyl ester (CM-H2DCFDA) assay.35−37 CM-H2DCFDA, when it is in its reduced state, emits no
fluorescence, whereas when cellular oxidation occurs, it is hydrolyzed
by esterases to releases the acetate moieties and thereby emitting
a green fluorescence. When MDA MB 231 cells were treated with compound 2 at 3.5 μM and irradiated, followed by the addition
of CM-H2DCFDA, we observed a fluorescence of 34.7% in cells.
Interestingly on increasing to 7 μM of compound 2, the cells showed about 58.9% of CM-H2DCFDA fluorescence
(Figure 8). In contrast,
light and dark control showed negligible fluorescence. This result
clearly indicates that PDT with compound 2 induced a
significant subcellular ROS generation leading to oxidative stress
in MDA-MB-231 cells.

Figure 8 Subcellular ROS detection after PDT using
the CM-H2DCFDA
probe under (A) dark control, (B) light control, after PDT treatment
of porphyrin conjugate 2 at (C) 3.5 and (D) 7 μM.

Cell proliferation is a tightly
regulated process following a cyclic
pattern and hence termed as the cell cycle. In the cell cycle pattern,
there are different checkpoints to ensure the quality of DNA replication
and chromosome distribution. In our study, we have analyzed the cell
cycle pattern by treating the cells with compound 2.
Interestingly, we found about 31% of the G2/M arrest after treatment,
which appeared significantly as exhibited in Figure S8 in the Supporting Information. Moreover, the PARP cleavage,
a 116 kDa nuclear poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase represents the hallmark
of DNA damage-induced apoptosis.38 We observed
that there was no PARP cleavage after treatment with compound 2 (7 μM) in the absence of light, which again confirms
the noncytotoxic nature of 2 in the absence of light
(Figure 9). However,
upon photo-irradiation with 2-induced PARP cleavage at
concentrations of 1.75, 3.5, and 7 μM, thus confirming that
compound 2 induces cell death via apoptosis.

Conclusions
In summary, we have
designed and synthesized picolylamine-linked
porphyrin derivatives 1–2 and have developed their
self-assembled structures which were investigated through various
spectral and microscopy techniques. Of the picolyl porphyrin systems
synthesized, compound 2 exhibited the vesicular structure
in methanol with an average size of 250 ± 50 nm, whereas the
compound 1 forms spherical structures. We established
the photodynamic activity of these porphyrin nanostructures through
the triplet excited state as well as the singlet oxygen generation
efficacy. Excited state studies revealed that zinc insertion in the
picolyl porphyrin system compound 1, both the core and
peripheral positions, enhances its intersystem crossing efficiency
and showed a triplet excited state quantum yield of 0.97 and a singlet
oxygen generation efficiency of 0.92. Moreover, the in vitro PDT investigations
of the porphyrin conjugates using the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB
231 cancerous cells revealed that compound 2 with five
zinc metal ions showed better photocytotoxicity having an IC50 value of 7 μM. The investigation on the mechanism of biological
activity showed that the cell death of these breast cancer cells mainly
occurred through the apoptotic pathway which was evidenced through
the TMRM assay, chromatin condensation, and AO/EB assay. Interestingly,
the conjugate 2 showed a cellular uptake within an hour
and an intracellular ROS generation of about 59%. Moreover, the cell
cycle pattern showed the cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase and the
mechanism of cell death happened to be via apoptosis as confirmed
through PARP cleavage. These results demonstrate that Zn2+ ion insertion in the picolyl porphyrin helps in enhancing the efficiency
of singlet oxygen generation and photodynamic activity. Henceforth
these systems can act as versatile sensitizers for future potential
applications in the field of PDT and cancer therapeutic regimes.

Experimental
Techniques
General Methods
We used a Shimadzu UV-3101 and 2401PC
UV–vis–NIR scanning spectrophotometer for monitoring
absorption spectra, whereas the emission spectra were monitored using
a SPEX-Fluorolog F112X spectrofluorimeter. The NMR spectra (1H and 13C) were recorded on 300 and 500 MHz Bruker advanced
DPX spectrometers using TMS as the standard. The emission quantum
yields of the compounds 1–2 were measured by the
relative method using hematoporphyrin (Φf = 0.01)
as the standard. The triplet excited state studies were employed with
a nanosecond laser flash photolysis system which is an Applied Photophysics
model LKS-20 laser kinetic spectrophotometer having a OCR-12 Series
Quanta Ray Nd:YAG laser. We fixed the analyzer and the laser beams
at right angles to each other with an energy of 50 mJ on exciting
at 355 nm. Cytotoxicity studies were measured with a Waldmann PDT
1200 L having a 1200 W lamp (200 J cm–2, 50 mW cm–2), which can excite in the region 600–720 nm.

Materials
TMRM, EB, Hoechst, AO, and MTT were purchased
from S.D. Fine chemicals, India; Sigma-Aldrich; U.S.A Merk Chemicals,
Germany. The reference compounds DPBF and β-carotene were recrystallized
using ethanol and chloroform solvent systems. The solvents used for
the synthesis and analysis were distilled by following standard protocols.

Determination of Triplet Excited State and Singlet Oxygen Quantum
Yields
The triplet quantum yield (ΦT) of
the porphyrin derivatives 1–2 and the quantification
of singlet oxygen generation were carried out by a relative method
using appropriate references at identical as well as optical conditions
as reported earlier.8

Morphological
Studies
The picolylamine-linked porphyrin
compounds 1–2 (10–4 M) were
taken in methanol and drop casted on the top of the Al grid for SEM
analysis, the Cu grid for TEM techniques and mica sheet surface for
AFM studies. To record the AFM images, we adopted the tapping mode
regime using a NTEGRA (NT-MDT), micro-TiN cantilever tips (NSG10)
having a 20–80 Nm–1 spring constant with
a 299 kHz resonance frequency. For TEM measurements, we used a high
resolution transmission electron microscope (JEOL 100 kV) and for
the sample preparations we followed the drop casting method (10–4 M) using a carbon-coated copper grid. A ZEISS EVO
MA and LS series model scanning electron microscope was used to record
the SEM images with operating conditions at 100–230 V and a
frequency of 50–60 Hz with a consumption of 2.5 kVA (single
phase). For all the microscopic studies the solvents were subjected
to evaporate at room temperature.

Determination of Cytotoxicity
by Measuring Cellular Proliferation
Cellular proliferation
is usually measured by employing the MTT
assay is used. In the present study human breast cancer cells (MDA
MB 231 cells), human colon (SW620), and cervical cancer (SiHa) (10
× 103 cells per well) were seeded to the wells of
two 96 well plates. One for light cytotoxicity and another for dark
cytotoxicity with 100 μL of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle
medium with 10% serum. After 24 h of incubation, porphyrin derivatives
compound 1 and 2 (stock 100 mM and control dimethyl sulphoxide
DMSO 0.025%) were added to a 96 well plate in the serial dilution
range of 3–50 μM and incubated for 1 h and irradiated
in one plate using a PDT lamp with 530 nm for 15 min while the other
plate was kept in the dark. The plates were removed from the incubator
after 24 h of treatment and MTT (5 mg/mL) added to each well. The
supernatant was carefully removed after 4 h, taking care that the
formazan crystals formed were not being removed and 100 μL of
isopropyl alcohol was added to each well. The plates were covered
by aluminum foil and kept in an incubator for 10 min to dissolve crystals.
Measured the absorbance at 570 nm and the percentage growth inhibition
was calculated using the following equation  

Flow Cytometric Analysis of Apoptosis with Annexin V-FITC/PI
After PDT treatments, the cells were harvested by trypsinization
followed by their resuspension in cold PBS. Annexin-V/PI staining
was done using an Invitrogen (USA) kit, following the manufacturer’s
protocol. Live cells were not stained with Annexin V-FITC/PI (bottom
left quadrant). A significant number of cells were stained positive
by both Annexin V-FITC and PI after 24 h of post PDT treatment indicating
early apoptosis-mediated cell death which has been analyzed by the
flow cytometer FACS Aria II (BD, USA).

TMRM Assay
An
active mitochondria in cells can be determined
by cationic cell permeate fluorescent dye, that is, TMRM. Approximately
105MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in 8 well-chambered
cover glass plates and incubated for 24 h. The stock solution of the
compound 2 (10 mM) was prepared and it is further diluted
to two different concentrations such as 3.5 and 7 μM in order
to carry out the concentration dependent analysis. Compound 2 was then added to the MDA-MB-231 cancerous
cell lines at two different concentrations and after 1 h, PDT was
obtained. Controls used were light and dark controls. A decrease in
the mitochondrial inner membrane potential because of apoptosis causes
a decrease in red fluorescence that was measured by a fluorescent
microscope(Leica DMI 4000 B, Germany).

Detection of Cellular ROS
Using the CM-H2DCFDA Assay
For cellular ROS stress
studies, approximately 106MDA-MB-231 cells
were plated in a 60 mm dish with serum-containing
media. After 24 h, the cells were treated with 3.5 and 7 μM
compound 2 and photo-irradiation was performed using a PDT lamp (
530 nm, 570 nM) for 15 min. To one plate, 7 μM compound 2, added without photo-irradiation, was taken as the dark
control nl and one only with PDT treatment was kept as the light control.
After 24 h of PDT with compound 2, cellular ROS content
was determined using the CM-H2DCFDA probe according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen), and a flow cytometric
analysis was then carried out using FACS Aria II (BD, USA).

Hoechst
Staining for Analyzing Chromatin Condensation
To study chromatin
condensation, approximately 105MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in 8 well-chambered cover glass
plates and incubated for 24 h. PDT treatment was performed as mentioned
previously in the TMRM assay. Light and dark controls were taken as
previously described above. After 24 h of post-treatment, the cells
were rinsed twice with PBS, and the cells were stained with Hoechst
dye 33342 (Invitrogen) (5 μg/mL) for 5 min at room temperature.
The cells were then washed twice with PBS and visualized under an
inverted fluorescence microscope (Leica DMI 4000 B, Germany).

AO/EB
Assay
Apoptotic cell morphology was assessed
by the AO/EB assay for 3.5 and 7 μM compound 2 nanoconjugates
in MDA-MB 231 cell lines. Approximately 105 cells MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in 96 well plates and the following
day PSs were added and incubated for 24 h. After that PDT treatment
was administered and incubated for 24 h. 1 μL AO stock (5 mg/mL)
and 1 μL EB stock (3 mg/mL) was added to 1 mL PBS and mixed
well. This was used as the AO/EB working solution. Then, media was
removed from the cell plate and 100 μL of AO/EB working solution
was added to each well. It was immediately viewed under an inverted
fluorescence microscope (Leica DMI 4000 B, Germany).

Cellular Uptake
and Localization
Approximately 105MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in 8 well chambered
cover glass plates and incubated for 24 h. MDA-MB 231 cells were incubated
with compound 2 for 1 h. The images were taken by using
fluorescence microscopy. For confirming the nuclear localization,
counter staining by the standard Hoechst dye 33342 (Invitrogen) (5
μg/mL) was used, and images were taken using appropriate filters
by a confocal microscope (Nikon A1R, Japan).

Cell Cycle Analysis
For cell cycle analysis, the 106 MDA MB 231 cells were
seeded in 60 mm culture dishes. Post
24 h of seeding, the cells were treated at different concentrations.
Post 24 h PDT treatment cells were trypsinized, harvested, and fixed
with 70% ethanol for 1 h and incubated at 4 °C. The fixed cells
were given RNase A (100 μg/mL) treatment for 1 h at 37 °C.
Then, it was treated with PI (10 μg/mL) for 15 min. The cells
were filtered using a cell strainer of 22 μm pore size (BD bioscience,
USA). Finally, DNA content of the cells was analyzed using FACS Aria
II (BD, USA).

Immunoblot
PDT treatment was done
as mentioned earlier
and incubated for 24 h. The treated cells were scraped out and RIPA
lysis buffer added. After 1.5 h in RIPA lysis buffer in a thermomixer,
the supernatant was collected and later quantified using the Bradford’s
reagent. SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting was carried out using
50 μg of total protein and probed using the PARP antibody. Then,
probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies
and detection was done using the enhanced chemiluminescence method.
The images were taken using the Molecular Imager VersaDoc MP4000 (Bio-Rad
USA) system.
