Methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2), the
important greenhouse gases, are capable of forming clathrate hydrates
under some suitable thermodynamic conditions. The gas storage capacity
of these materials is high, and therefore they are often useful in
gas storage applications. Certain expensive and toxic chemicals are
employed to accelerate/decelerate the process. In this study, we report
rapid (∼30–50 min) and effective (∼80%) methane
hydrate conversion in the presence of three naturally occurring additives
such as dry powders from Nelumbo nucifera (Indian lotus), Piper betle (betel),
and Azadirachta indica (neem), at lower
concentrations (0.5 wt %). Obtained results were carefully compared
with the well-known kinetic promoter (sodium dodecyl sulfate). All
the biomaterials are equally good kinetic promoters for methane hydrates,
although the required subcooling is significantly large. However,
no hydrate formation is observed with CO2 gas.

==== Body
Introduction
The clathrate hydrates, also known as
gas hydrates where the host
cages are constituted with the water molecules alone. These materials
are attractive globally, and many research groups are working to exploit
their potential for various causes, such as they are an essential
energy source with natural fuel gas molecules encased as guests. Substantial
hydrate deposits, both under permafrost and marine sedimentary strata,
are remained unexploited and suitable technology for gas recovery
is at an infant stage. The size selectivity and larger storage capacity
of guest molecules opened up many attractive applications for fuel
gas separation, storage, and transportation applications.1−3 Additionally, the gas hydrate-based approach is useful in the carbon-dioxide
capture and storage,4,5 and desalination technology.6,7

The research on gas hydrates, to begin with, started purely
as
a scientific inquisitiveness, but later, it was recognized as one
of the leading causes of blockages in a petroleum/gas-carrying pipeline
network. Later on, research efforts were deepened to find a solution
for the purpose. Noticeable drawbacks for utilizing the gas hydrate-based
technology for gas storage and transportation are sluggish formation
rates and feeble water to hydrate conversions.1 Some additives, in addition to the constituents necessary in the
hydrate process, are used to decelerate/accelerate the structural
transformation. Conventionally, three types of inhibiting materials,
viz. thermodynamic (THI), kinetic (KHI), and antiagglomerates (AAs)
are being tried for preventing the formation of such blockages. The
THI materials such as alcohols and glycols, when used along with hydrate-forming
systems, alter the formation/dissociation conditions to lower temperatures
and high pressures, compared to the pure systems. Noticeable drawbacks,
however, are that they ought to be used in large quantities and majority
of them are toxic and cost ineffective. The second type of materials
namely KHI significantly retard the onset of hydrate formation, and
thus the phase conversion to hydrates can be delayed. Commonly, water-soluble
polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone and polyvinyl caprolactam are
used as KHIs.8,9 The third class of materials AAs
avoids the accumulation of hydrate particulates into larger chunks.
Thus, the flow-related issues can be curtailed to a more significant
extent with small-sized hydrate particulates. The study on AAs is
still at an infant stage for gas hydrate systems, and some proteins
and bioextracts from living organisms are being tested in the hydrate
formation process.10,11 Usage of inhibitors is essential
to prevent the hydrate nucleation and growth. On the contrary, rapid
and efficient hydrate conversion is often preferred in specific gas
hydrate-based applications such as gas storage and transportation.
It has been shown that well-known THIs, such as methanol, in low dosages
can serve as promoters and the rate of gas uptake is faster.12 Therefore, the research on different experimental
configurations such as spray-type reactor cells and various matrix
materials such as silica powders and activated carbons are being used
to confine the water molecules in the pore spaces. Interestingly,
the matrix materials do not directly take part in actual hydrate cage
formation, but they help in accelerating the hydrate growth process.13−15

All the materials used as promotors/inhibitors in the hydrate-based
technology are chemical-based polymers, and are non-ecofriendly and
also costly. Particularly, if one needs to use them at larger concentrations,
the process becomes more expensive. It would certainly be attractive
to achieve similar results using some naturally occurring materials,
involving less preparation.

Wang et al.16 have inspected the “bioclathrate”
hydrate formation of both CH4 and CO2 gases.
They demonstrated the use of natural and renewable biosorbents in
enhancing the gas storage (up to 120 v/v) in the form of bioclathrates
in nonstirred configuration. The porous structure of certain plants
and fungi such as mushrooms and eggplants was responsible for higher
“sorption” of greenhouse gas molecules. On the other
hand, extracts of tomato were showing significantly lesser clathrate
conversion, similar to the pure water system. Fakharian et al.17 and Babakhani and Alamdari18 have also investigated the methane storage capacity and
the stability of methane hydrates using water-soluble starch from
potato and maize. They inferred that these systems are capable of
forming hydrates in a way similar to sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS).
Wang et al.19 have also studied methane
storage capacity in the form of hydrates using tea extracts in an
unstirred reactor using an initial methane pressure of 10.5 MPa (@293
K). They reported higher volumetric storage capacity (172 v/v or 95%
hydrate conversion) in green tea (Longjing) and oolong tea (Tieguanyin),
whereas the storage capacity in black tea (Yunnan) was meagre and
was comparable to the bulk water system under similar conditions.
Because the commercial value for such teas are high and are not advantageous
to use them for storage applications, and therefore the authors have
examined two other bioadditives namely extracts from dry leaves of Bauhinia purpurea and Mallotus apelta. Further, the CO2 hydrate formation was also tested in
the presence of sugar (trehalose)20 and
also in freshly cut radishes and eggplants, whole grape, and bean
samples.21 The presence of CO2 hydrates in these biosamples was assessed by the spectroscopic methods
and also the self-preservation phenomena, ascribed to CO2 hydrates, is found extremely useful for storage applications in
the food and beverage industry.

This study reports the use of
fine powders, prepared from the dry
leaves of three commonly found trees, such as Nelumbo
nucifera (Indian lotus), Piper betle (betel), and Azadirachta indica (neem),
in the clathrate hydrate process. We carried out all the experiments
in isochoric geometry without any stirring. We observed that these
powders are helpful in accelerating the methane hydrates even at lower
concentrations (0.5 wt %), whereas no such effect has been found in
CO2 hydrates.

Results and Discussion
Representative
pressure–temperature (p, T) trajectories for all the hydrate-forming systems are
depicted in Figure 1, and the measurements were carried two to three times to ensure
the repeatability of experimental data. The experiments were conducted
in the isochoric and unstirred geometry. As shown in Figure 1A, the pressure variation in
the quiescent water system is linear, and no abrupt drop is observed
in the hydrate stable region, whereas an abrupt pressure decrease
in the 0.5 wt % SDS-containing system indicates the existence of methane
hydrates. Similarly, the addition of 0.5 wt % of leaf powders, such
as lotus (Figure 1B),
betel, (Figure 1C)
and neem (Figure 1D),
as additives to water, also induced the pressure change, which leads
to the hydrate formation. The black and red symbols in all these graphs
represent the variations during freezing and thawing cycles, respectively,
whereas the blue line is the computed phase boundary curve for the
H2O–CH4 system using CSMGem.22

Figure 1 Pressure–temperature (p–T) trajectories of the CH4–H2O system in the presence of 0.5 wt % additives. The segments A to
D are for the additives SDS, LL, BL and NL, respectively. The black
and red symbols are recorded behavior during freezing and thawing
cycles, whereas the blue curve represents the computed phase boundary
curve. The cyan and purple dots in A indicate the observed behavior
during cooling and warming cycles in the CH4 + H2O system (without additives).

The process of hydrate conversion in these systems with SDS
(a),
lotus leaf (LL) (b), betel leaf (BL) (c), and neem leaf (NL) (d) powders
as additives to the H2O–CH4 system is
further illustrated in Figure 2 by following the temporal variations in the local temperature
and the amount of methane gas in the reactor vessel. The process of
hydrate conversion from gas–water is an exothermic change and
is often associated with heat release, which causes an increase in
the local temperature (shown as inset-1 for all the samples in Figure 2). It may not always
be possible to have measurable temperature change because it will
depend on factors such as the quantum of the exothermic heat, conductivity
of hydrate-bearing medium, and the placement of the temperature probe.
Therefore, the local temperature measurements at multiple locations
within the hydrate crystalliser could be handy in assessing the spatial
position of hydrate nucleation. Nevertheless, a sharp decrease in
the gas pressure also indicates the hydrate nucleation and growth
of the hydrate phase. As shown in Figure 2, a sharp reduction in the amount of methane
gas and even temperature increase (shown as insets—1) is observed
in the presence of all the additives. As shown in Figure 1, an increase in the gas pressure,
due to hydrate dissociation, often follows the computed phase–boundary
curve if the dissociation process is conducted at slow rates. However,
a rapid dissociation of the hydrate system could induce measurable
deviations from the calculated behavior. The inset (2) in Figure 2, shows measured
temperature in the time interval during hydrate dissociation. Observed
faster gas release in this time zone is because of gas hydrate dissociation.
The rate of heating in these systems with bioadditives is less than
1.0 K/h, whereas it is ∼2.2 K/h in the case of SDS. Thus, the
heating rate is not a predominant factor for the deviation from the
phase boundary curve. As said earlier, placement of the thermal probe
or some unknown constituents of the bioadditives could be contributing
to this deviation.

behavior during hydrate formation and dissociation stages, respectively.
The parts a to d are for the additives SDS, LL, BL and NL, respectively.
The insets (1) and (2) in each part in this figure are the temporal
changes in the temperature.

The micro-Raman spectroscopic method was used to characterize
the
hydrate samples. The hydrate reactor was precooled to 150 K by keeping
it in liquid nitrogen, and the residual gas pressure was purged out.
The hydrate samples were preserved for the spectroscopic analysis. Figure 3 shows characteristic
features of CH4 molecules encased in the hydrates synthesized
in the presence of SDS and other bioadditives. Observed Raman modes
around 2905 and 2915 cm–1 are because of CH4 molecules occupying the cages of sI hydrates. The characteristic
methane stretching mode at 2905 cm–1 is because
of the guest encased in the 51262 cage of sI,
whereas the one at 2915 cm–1 is because of the CH4 molecule trapped in the 512 cage.23,24

Raman signatures of CH4 encaged in the
large and small cages of sI. The blue lines are fitted Lorentzian
to the recorded data (red dots).

The LL shows outstanding water repellency. The reasons for
these
superior properties can be recognized to the combination of micro-
and nano-structures with an optimized geometry and the unique chemical
composition of the epicuticular waxes. The chemical analyzes of the
isolated waxes show that the wax of the upper side of the leaf contains
ca. 65% of various nonacosanediols and only 22% of nonacosan-10-ol,
whereas the wax of the underside contains predominantly nonacosan-10-ol
(53%) and only 15% of diols, together with 18% of alkanes. The remaining
13 and 14% could not be identified.25 Phytochemical
analysis on leaves (P. betle) revealed
the presence of alkaloids, tannins, carbohydrate, amino acids, and
steroidal components. The main constituent of the leaves is a volatile
oil, called betel oil, and contains two phenols, betel phenol (chavibetol
and chavicol). Codinene has also been found.26 The principal constituents of neem (A. indica) leaves include protein (7.1%), carbohydrates (22.9%), minerals,
calcium, phosphorus, vitamin C, carotene, and so forth. However, they
also contain glutamic acid, tyrosine, aspartic acid, alanine, praline,
glutamine- and cystine-like amino acids, and several fatty acids (dodecanoic,
tetradecanoic, elcosanic, and so forth.).27

Some constituents present in these bioadditives, particularly
amino
acids are well-known kinetic promoters for both CH4 and
CO2 gases, even when they are present in low concentrations.28−32 However, as noticed by Wang et al.,19 it may not be possible to isolate all the constituents of bioadditives
and study their impact on the formation of clathrates, rather their
collective role is important for greenhouse gas storage applications.
Further, the effect of additives is not the same on all greenhouse
gas clathrates.28−32 The methane storage capacity in the presence of investigated bioadditives
is similar to SDS (see Table 1). The perfect unit cell composition of sI gas hydrates is
6(51262)·2(512)·46H2O. Thus, the maximum gas uptake under ideal conditions is
0.174 mol/molH2O. Virtually it is difficult to attain 100%
cage occupancy, and hence the gas hydrates are better known as the
nonstoichiometric complexes. The cage occupancy values computed using
the CSMGem model are 0.8363 (for 512) and 0.9469 (for 51262). Thus, the expected methane gas consumption
is 0.159 (±0.002) mol/molH2O.28 Thus, from the observed methane gas consumption values it is concluded
that about 80% water has been utilised in hydrate conversion in the
presence of bioadditives. A similar amount of hydrate conversion has
been observed in the SDS system, and the time taken for 90% of gas
uptake is also similar (see Table 1). However, the hydrate formation in the presence of
these bioadditives requires significantly higher cooling than SDS,
and hence they can be categorized as good thermodynamic inhibitors
for methane hydrates, even under such lower concentrations. The methane
gas storage capacity and the kinetics of the process are efficient
and rapid, and as such comparable with well-tested amino acids.28,32

a Formation kinetics is measured from
after the hydrate nucleation. All the experiments were conducted with
1.6 mol solution and 0.5 wt % additive.

We also conducted similar experiments with CO2 gas and
found that these bioadditives are not useful in CO2 hydrates. Figure 4 shows the p–T trajectory in the CO2–H2O system, which possesses
all the bioadditives and linearly or significantly less pressure reduction,
often less than pure water, in the temperature range 264–293
K. However, the addition of 0.5 wt % SDS indicates the hydrate formation.
The average hydrate conversion in the CO2–H2O system without any additives is 17.3% (see Figure 4B), whereas the addition of
SDS increases it to 55.8% (see Figure 4A). However, as shown in Figure 4B no hydrate formation occurred with LL.
On the other hand, the addition of betel (see Figure 4C) and neem (see Figure 4D) leaf powders is also less useful for CO2 hydrates, and average conversion is only 14.5 and 8.3%, which
is less than that in the pure water system. Earlier we also noticed
that certain amino acids, for example, l-methionine is a
good promotor for both CH4 and CO2 hydrates,
whereas l-phenylalanine does not have equal promotion effect
for these greenhouse gases.28 Thus, we
can conclude that these bioadditives do not promote CO2 hydrates.

The chosen bioadditives are relatively inexpensive and widely
occur
in all seasons. Unlike the starch powders, these materials are capable
of forming hydrates in nonstirred conditions which is an added advantage
in the scale-up process. Further, the kinetics of gas uptake is also
significantly faster and is more or less similar to SDS (see Table 1). As already stated,
it would be difficult to assign the rapid and efficient hydrate formation
to a single chemical constituent. However, we can separate water-soluble
parts from these bioadditives. Thus, we conducted another set of experiments
using water-soluble extracts from these bioadditives, and the methane
gas uptake and the formation kinetics is identical to the earlier
experiments using betel and NL powders. However, the gas uptake is
∼40% lower in the hydrates from the LL extracts. Nevertheless,
the advantages such as an efficient and rapid hydrate conversion related
to these bioadditives are attractive, and these are excellent materials
for methane gas storage applications.

Conclusions
In
summary, we conducted experiments to store the greenhouse gases
namely CH4 and CO2 in the form of gas hydrates.
The isochoric experimental configuration, without continuous stirring,
is user-friendly for upscaling. Addition of 0.5 wt % dry powders of N. nucifera (Indian lotus), P. betle (betel), and A. indica (neem) have
dramatic influence on the hydrate formation capacity in the CH4–H2O system, whereas no hydrate formation
occurred in the CO2–H2O system. Greater
subcooling is necessary for the hydrate systems in the presence of
these bioadditives. However, methane storage capacity and kinetics
of gas uptake are comparable with the 0.5 wt % SDS system. The natural
occurrence, less preparation, and cost factors are attractive for
their usage in methane storage applications.

Experimental Section
Materials
High-purity (99.95%) methane gas is used
to conduct experiments and is obtained from Bhuruka Gas Company. Millipore
water type 1 (deionised) is used in the preparation of the sample
solution. The fine powders of bioadditives were made from dried (at
ambient temperature under shade for several days) leaves. The dry
leaves were powdered in a domestic mixture (Philips-HL1643) and were
sieved using a BSS-60 sieve. The powder (0.5 wt %) was added to the
water and was mixed for about half-an-hour using a magnetic spinner.

Apparatus
A high-pressure reactor vessel (250 mL volume)
made of SS-316 is used as the hydrate synthesizer, which can resist
a pressure of up to 10 MPa. A mixture of glycol and water in an appropriate
ratio is used as a coolant to decrease/increase the temperature to
the desired value in the reactor vessel using the closed loop chiller
(ANCRYO AL RSS-40). Temperature measurements were done using a platinum
resistance thermometer (Pt 100) placed inside the thermowell with
an accuracy of ±0.2 K. A pressure transducer (WIKA, type A-10
for pressure range 0–25 MPa with ±0.5% accuracy) is used
for pressure measurements.

Procedure
The aqueous solution (29
g) was poured into
the reactor vessel, and the reactor vessel is clamped tightly. The
methane gas is filled up to desired pressure into the reactor through
an inlet valve using the Teledyne ISCO syringe pump. The pump connection
is removed, and the chiller is set to lower temperature into the hydrate
stability zone. After some time, the pressure in the reactor vessel
falls abruptly with temperature increase, indicating the hydrate formation.
The temperature and pressure data are recorded for every 30 s. The
molar concentration of methane gas (ΔnH,t) in the hydrate phase during the experiment
at time t is defined by the following equation 1  where Z represents the compressibility
factor, calculated using the Peng–Robinson equation of state,
available gas volume (V) during the process was assumed
as constant, that is, the volume changes because of phase transitions
were neglected. ng,0 and ng,t denote the number of moles of methane
gas at zero time and at time t, respectively.

Raman
Measurements
The Raman measurements were performed
using the instrument (Horiba, T-64000) coupled with an air-cooled
argon ion laser (514.5 nm). The gas hydrate sample is loaded into
the Linkam FTIR 600 stage at atmospheric pressures and 153 K. The
laser is focused on the sample only during the data acquisition using
50× lens. The GRAMS/3 software was used to fit the recorded data
to the Lorentzian components. The peak position, full width at half-maximum
intensity, and peak intensity of the individual peaks were allowed
to vary as free parameters in the peak-fitting procedure.
