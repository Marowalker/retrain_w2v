Tiamulin
(TML) is a diterpenoid antibiotic used in animals. In
this study, a gold nanoparticle immunochromatographic strip assay
and an indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ic-ELISA)
were developed to detect the residue of TML in chicken. TML aminobutyric
was synthesized and conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin by mixed
anhydride method as immunogen, whereas TML was connected to ovalbumin
with 1,1′-carbonyldiimidazole as coating antigen. Under optimized
conditions, the ultrasensitive monoclonal antibody-based ic-ELISA
exhibited a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 0.36 ng/mL with a working range of 0.14–0.9 ng/mL
for TML. A rapid and sensitive immunochromatographic strip assay was
developed with a TML cutoff value of 2.5 ng/mL. On the basis of these
results, both developed methods are useful for TML detection in chicken.

==== Body
Introduction
Tiamulin (TML), a diterpenoid compound,
is one of the world’s
top 10 used veterinary antibiotics with strong activity against mycoplasma, Streptococcus spp., and Staphylococcus aureus.(1−3) TML is widely used as a veterinary drug and feed additive to treat
respiratory diseases and encourage growth in cattle.4−6 However, TML, similarly to other antibiotics, had been reported
to have adverse effects on human health, which have been linked to
drug residues found in food-animal tissues. These residues may have
the potential to contribute to the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria.
Officially, residual TML has been strictly limited in the European
Union and Japan as well as China where the maximum residual limits
for TML and its metabolite 8-α-hydroxymutilin are between 100
and 3000 ng/g in food matrix. Therefore, a rapid and sensitive detection
method for quantitation of TML and its metabolites is needed.

There have been many methods developed for TML detection, including
liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry,7 high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC),8 ultra-HPLC,9,10 and gas chromatography.
Although these instrument-based analytical methods have low detection
limits and good accuracy, they require skilled and trained labor and
highly specialized equipment. Furthermore, these techniques were hindered
by low sample throughput and lengthy analysis times. Thus, a rapid
and sensitive TML detection method is required.

In recent years,
a number of immunological assays have been developed
and widely adopted for the detection of a wide variety of antibiotics,
such as chloramphenicol, florfenicol, and tetracycline.11−13 The key to establishing an immunological method is to prepare a
high-quality primary antibody. Wang et al.14 established an indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ic-ELISA) for TML detection using a polyclonal antibody with
an IC50 value of 200 ng/mL. In our study, we
based our ic-ELISA development on an ultrasensitive monoclonal antibody
(mAb) for TML and also developed an immunochromatographic strip (ICS)
assay for the determination of TML in chickens.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals
TML, TML fumarate, and aminobutyric standards
were purchased from J&K Scientific Ltd. (Beijing, China). Keyhole
limpet hemocyanin (KLH; MW 4 500 000 Da), bovine serum
albumin (BSA; MW 67 000 Da), ovalbumin (OVA; MW 45 000
Da), complete Freund’s adjuvant, incomplete Freund’s
adjuvant, 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), tributylamine,
isobutyl chloroformate, Tween-20, horseradish peroxidase, and gelatin
were obtained from Sigma Chemical Company (St. Louis, MO). Enzyme
immunoassay-grade horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin
was purchased from Kang-cheng Bioengineering Co. (Shanghai, China).
Cell culture reagents, including poly(ethylene glycol) solution, HT
supplement, HAT supplement, and 1640 cell culture medium, were obtained
from Life Technologies Corporation (Shanghai, China).

Jieyi
Biotech. Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) provided all of the materials
used for creating test strips; these include glass fiber membrane
(Ahlstrom 8964) used for the sample pad, nitrocellulose (NC) membrane
used to immobilize the coating antigen, an H5076 filter paper for
the absorbent pad, and the backing material (poly(vinyl chloride),
PVC). Other reagents were of analytical grade and purchased from Sinopharm
Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China)

Solution
We prepared
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS,
0.01 M, pH 7.4) in our laboratory, and the washing buffer was obtained
by adding 0.05% Tween-20 (v/v) to 0.01 M PBS. The coating buffer (CB,
0.05 M, pH 9.6) was prepared by dissolving 2.93 g of NaHCO3 and 1.59 g of Na2CO3 in 1 L of purified water.
The blocking buffer contained 0.2% gelatin in the CB. The substrate
solution consisted of solutions A (Na2HPO4,
citric acid, and H2O2) and B (0.06% v/v TMB
in glycol) at a ratio of 5:1 (v/v). The stop solution was prepared
by diluting 12 M sulfuric acid into 2 M.

Hapten Synthesis
The hapten TML aminobutyric (TML-AS)
was synthesized using the modified method of Yao et al. (Figure 1).15 Briefly, TML fumarate (610 mg, 1 mmol) was dissolved in
10 mL of dichloromethane and triethylamine (100 mg, 1 mmol) was added,
the solution was stirred under ice cooling for 30 min. Then, bis(p-nitrophenyl) carbonate (310 mg, 1 mmol) was added and
the solution recovered to room temperature (28 °C). After stirring
for 1 h, the degree of chemical reaction was monitored with thin-layer
chromatography until completion. Subsequently, methyl 4-aminobutyrate
hydrochloride (170 mg, 1 mmol) was used to basify with trimethylamine
in ice baths overnight at room temperature. Water and saturated
brine were used to rinse the reaction system and anhydrous sodium
sulfate for drying. After the drying agent was removed by filtration,
vacuum column chromatography (silica gel of 200–300 mesh, mobile
phase consisted of petroleum ether/ethyl acetate = 15:1 to 10:1 elution)
and drying were used for purification resulting in 220 mg of intermediate
products. Finally, the ester products (220 mg, 0.44 mmol), dissolved
in 1,4-dioxane (2 mL), were hydrolyzed with trifluoroacetic acid (2
mL) in water (15 mL) at 45 °C for 6 h. After rinsing and purifying
as aforementioned, 85 mg of the TML-AS hapten was obtained.

of TML-AS.

Preparation of Immunogen
and Coating Antigen
Synthesis of Immunogen TML-AS-MA-BSA
For synthesis
of the immunogen, we based our method on historical methods found
in the literature (reference) with some modifications.16,17 TML-AS (15 mg) was dissolved in 1.5 mL of dried N,N-dimethylformamide and kept at 4 °C for 15
min. Then, 12 μL of tributylamine and 6.5 μL of isobutyl
chloroformate were added to the cooled solution at 10 min intervals
while stirring. The reaction mixture was kept at 4 °C and stirred
for 1 h (solution A). Meanwhile, BSA (50 mg) was dissolved with 5.0
mL of CB and cooled to 4 °C (solution B). Solution A was added
to solution B dropwise and maintained at pH 8.0, the mixture was stirred
for 6 h at 4 °C and dialyzed against PBS for 3 days at room temperature.
Finally, the presence of TML-AS-MA-BSA was confirmed with UV and polyacrylamide
gel electrophoreses.

Synthesis of Coating Antigen TML-carbodiimide
(CDI)-OVA
The TML hapten was conjugated to OVA via the linker
carbodiimide
(CDI) on the basis of a modified procedure.18−20 Specifically,
10 mg of TML and 20 mg of 1,1′-carbonyldiimidazole were added
to 3 mL of dried N,N-dimethylformamide
and the reaction incubated overnight at 60 °C with stirring.
Next, the mixture was added to 50 mg of OVA in 5 mL of 0.1 mol/L CBS
(pH 9.0) slowly with stirring. After 12 h incubation at room temperature,
the conjugates were purified and confirmed as described earlier.

TML mAb Preparation
Female BALB/c mice (aged 6–8
weeks, weight 18–20 g) were the most suitable for immune experiments.21−23 The immunogen TML-AS-MA-BSA was emulsified with the same amount
of Freund’s complete adjuvant for primary immunization, ensuring
100 μg of immunogen per mouse was used. Incomplete Freund’s
adjuvant was used for booster immunizations with only 50 μg
of immunogen. Each immunization, at 3 week intervals, was executed
with the same volume of immunogen (0.1 mL) by subcutaneous multisite
injections. After three immunizations, blood samples were collected
and analyzed with ic-ELISA 1 week after booster administration. Positive
BALB/c mice with the highest inhibition and lowest IC50 values were given the final immunization with 25 μg of immunogen
by intraperitoneal injection. The mice were fused with Sp 2/0 myeloma
cells after 3 days. The qualified cell was obtained through subcloning
3 times, selection, and followed by injection into mice for the production
of ascites. The TML mAb was prepared by bitterness-saturated ammonium
sulfate method from ascites and dialyzed against PBS.24,25

ic-ELISA
A 96-well polystyrene titration plates were
used to perform the ic-ELISA, as described earlier. The optimized
concentration of antibody and antigen was obtained initially; then
with the aim of improving the stability and sensitivity of the assay,
several additional experimental factors were evaluated, including
pH (5.5, 6.5, 7.5, and 8.5), NaCl concentration (0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6,
and 3.2%), and methanol concentration (0, 10, 20, and 30%, v/v). The
optical density values of zero concentration and IC50 were
two core indicators to determine optimal values. Finally, mAb standard
curve was established on the basis of optimization experiment parameters
as well as the nominal concentration for the coating and antibody.
Antibody performance was evaluated with maximum absorbance (Absmax), IC50, Absmax/IC50, and
detection limit (the range of standard concentration corresponding
to IC20–IC80).

Recovery Test in Chicken
Samples Using ic-ELISA
TML-negative
chicken sample (confirmed with HPLC) was used for this assay. Different
amounts of TML (0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 ng) were spiked into 1 g of chicken
sample in 15 mL centrifuge tubes, respectively. The spiked chicken
sample was mixed well and immersed in 4 mL of acetonitrile. After
rotating for 5 min, the mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 4500
× g. The upper organic solution (1 mL) was transferred
to a glass tube and evaporated under nitrogen flow at room temperature. n-Hexane (1 mL) and PBS (1 mL) were used for redissolution
of residue, and the solution was rotated for 1 min and centrifuged
for 5 min at 4500 × g. Finally, the aqueous
phase was taken out and used for subsequent analysis.11

Development of an ICS Assay for TML Detection
Preparation
of Gold Nanoparticles (GNPs)
Colloidal
GNPs were prepared by the sodium citrate reduction method.26,27 Specifically, 50 mL of 0.01% (m/v) HAuCl4·4H2O solution was heated to boiling with constant stirring in
a clean flask. Then, 2 mL of freshly prepared 1% (w/v) trisodium citrate
solution was added quickly under stirring and kept for boiling for
another 10 min until claret. The GNPs were cooled to room temperature
and stored at 4 °C for further use. Transmission electron microscopy
and UV–vis spectrometry were used for the characterization
of GNPs.

Preparation of Gold-Labeled Anti-TML mAb
The protocol
used for the connection of the anti-TML mAb and GNPs was previously
described. First, the pH of GNPs (10 mL) was adjusted to 8.0 by adding
0.1 M K2CO328 and
then the purified anti-TML mAb (2 g/L, 80 μL) was added dropwise
into the solution. After mixing for 2 h at room temperature, 1 mL
of 50 mL of 10% (m/v) BSA was added to eliminate nonspecific binding
and the mixture was incubated for another 2 h under constant stirring.
The solution was centrifuged 3 times for 25 min at 6000 × g to remove excess reagents, and the residue was resuspended
in resuspension buffer (0.02 M PBS, 2% BSA, 1% sucrose, 0.04% NaN3, and 0.01% Tween-20, pH 7.2, w/v) each time. The gold-labeled
anti-TML mAb was stored at 4 °C for further use.

ICS Preparation
The ICS structure was divided into
four parts: the sample pad, the absorbent pad, NC membrane, and PVC
backing card.29,30 The goat anti-mouse IgG (0.5
mg/mL) and the coating antigen TML-CDI-OVA (1 mg/mL) were loaded on
the NC membrane with 0.5 cm separating the control line (C-line) and
test line (T-line). The NC membrane was dried at 37 °C for 1
h and pasted on the center of the PVC backing card and then the sample
pad was attached on the side of the card closest to the test line
with the absorbent pad on the other side. Finally, the card was cut
into 2.8 mm wide strips after vacuum drying overnight.

Principle
and Characteristics of the ICS Assay
The
sample solution and gold-labeled anti-TML mAb were added into microwell
plates and reacted for 5 min.31 After the
sample pad of the strip was inserted, the solution quickly travels
up the strip due to capillary action. The gold-labeled mAb was combined
with coating antigen on the T-line, which results in a visible red
color in the absence of TML in the sample solution. Conversely, when
TML is abundant in the sample solution, the T-line remains colorless
due to the competitive action between TML and the coating antigen.
The C-line functions as a control due to the goat anti-mouse IgG binding
all redundant mAb present, resulting in a red color.

In this
study, a stock solution of 1 mg/mL of TML was prepared by dissolving
5 mg of TML in 5 mL of PBS and standard gradient dilutions (0, 0.05,
0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2.5 ng/mL) were prepared by directly diluting
the stock solution using PBS. Subsequently, 50 μL of each standard
dilution was mixed with the labeled mAb in the microwell plate for
5 min, and the sample pad of the ICS was inserted into the mixture.
After 5 min, the color intensity of the T and C bands was quantified
with a BioDot TSR3000 Membrane Strip Reader (BioDot Inc.).

Sample
Pretreatment and Spiked Sample Analyses
Sample
pretreatment was similar to ic-ELISA with only a modification of using
a TML-added gradient (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 ng/g).

Results
and Discussion
Antigen Characterization
In this
study, artificial
antigen was synthesized by conjugating a small molecule to the carrier
protein based on previously published methods (Figure 1). KLH was selected to combine TML-AS by
the mixed anhydride method as immunogen TML-AS-KLH, whereas OVA was
selected to combine by the CDI method as coating antigen TML-CDI-OVA.

UV spectroscopy was used for the characterization of immunogen
and coating antigen. TML and TML-AS kept increasing in the 230–280
nm photometric range, with OVA demonstrating the characteristic peaks
at 280 nm and KLH at 280 and 350 nm. The conjugated antigen displayed
strong concentration-dependent absorption at 280 nm revealing that
TML-AS-KLH and TML-CDI-OVA were synthetized successfully (Figure 2).

ic-ELISA Optimization and Specificity
To optimize experimental
parameters, the concentration of the selected 3B1 antibody was set
at 0.025 μg/mL, whereas the TML-CDI-OVA coating antigen was
set at 0.1 μg/mL. The methanol content, ionic strength, and
pH of the PBS buffer were several factors that influenced the ic-ELISA
performance. To be specific, they could affect protein conformation
and significantly affect the combination of antigen and antibody.
Ionic strength had a significant impact on absorbance values and IC50 (Figure 3a). There was a perfect S curve at 0.8% NaCl content with the lowest
IC50 value. Results of pH optimization experiments are
depicted in Figure 3b, pH 5.5 and pH 7.5 had a similar lower IC50, but Absmax was the highest at pH 7.4. Finally, the results showed
that with increasing methanol concentration, Absmax decreased
and IC50 increased (Figure 3c), demonstrating that a 0% methanol content is the
most optimal condition for the assay.

and standard inhibition

From the foregoing, 0.8% NaCl,
pH 7.4, and 0% methanol in PBS buffer
were selected as the optimal conditions for ic-ELISA. The standard
curve was created on the basis of the optimal conditions (Figure 3d), the IC50 value was 0.36 ng/mL and the detection limit was 0.14–0.9
ng/mL (IC20 to IC80).

ic-ELISA Recovery Test
in Chicken Samples
To investigate
the interference contributed from sample matrix, the spiked chicken
samples were diluted 5 times resulting in gradient TML concentrations
between 0.1 and 2 ng/g and analyzed with ic-ELISA. The TML recovery
was 87–96% and the coefficient of variation was 2.1–6.6%
(Table 1). It was also
concluded that the recovery test performed better in the detection
limit (2–5 ng/mL) of ic-ELISA.

Optimization and Characteristics
of the Test Strips
The wet method was used in our ICS assay,
and the TML standard was
diluted with PBS. Different antibodies (2H8 and 5E12) and coating
antigens (TML-CDI-OVA-30 and TML-CDI-OVA-60) were optimized along
with the concentrations of TML standards (0 and 0.5 ng/mL). The results
revealed that 2H8 and TML-CDI-OVA-30 were the most suitable, along
with the coating antibody concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. The TML standard
was diluted with PBS from stock solution (1 mg/mL) resulting in a
titer range between 0 and 2.5 ng/mL. In the optimum conditions, the
C-line performed well and the cutoff value of the T-line was 2.5 ng/mL
(Figure 4).

and 7 = 2.5 ng/mL.

TML Detection in Chicken
Samples Using the ICS Strips
The coating concentration was
optimized using 1 mL of GNP with 4
μL of K2CO3 and 8 μg/mL of 2H8.
The results can be seen in Figure 5a, where the results indicate that a concentration
of 0.5 mg/mL of the coating antibody was optimal for subsequent assays.
The gradient spiked chicken samples were prepared following the ic-ELISA
preparation protocol, and the extracting solution was analyzed with
ICS assay within 5 min. The strip performed well and the cutoff value
was 5 ng/mL (Figure 5b).

Conclusions
In this study, we described
an ultrasensitive mAb-based assay against
TML with a demonstrated IC50 value of 0.36 ng/mL. Furthermore,
an ic-ELISA was established by optimizing ionic strength, pH, and
methanol content, with a working range of 0.14–0.9 ng/mL. The
assay also had good performance in spike-recovery experiments using
chicken samples. Finally, a simple and portable ICS assay was also
successfully developed for TML monitoring with a cutoff value of 2.5
ng/mL in PBS and 5 ng/mL in chicken samples.
