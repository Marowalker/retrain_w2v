In this work, we synthesized gold
nanoclusters within a Zirconium-based
metal–organic framework (AuNCs@UiO-66) that may create new
prospects for the development of novel sensing materials for biosensor
applications. The resulting AuNCs@UiO-66 nanocomposite exhibits red
fluorescence with a high quantum yield (11%), and the AuNCs are homogeneously
distributed along UiO-66. Analytical and morphological characterizations
of the resulting material were carried out by UV–visible spectroscopy,
photoluminescence spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,
X-ray diffraction, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy.
The synthesized AuNCs@UiO-66 nanocomposite was used for the effective
detection of Hg2+ ions with a detection limit as low as
77 pM. Moreover, the fabricated sensors also successfully detected
Hg2+ in real water samples. This sensor is stable and highly
fluorescent, developed using a simple fabrication method, and would
be constructive for the detection of other metal ions and in biological
applications.

Introduction
Routine sensing of mercury ions (Hg2+) is a major part
of environmental monitoring in water, food sources, soil, and other
environmental systems because of their harmful outcome for the environment
and human health.1 Water and soil can be
contaminated by the long atmospheric residence time of Hg0 vapors that can be oxidized to inorganic Hg.2 High levels of exposure to Hg can have harmful effects on the brain,
kidney, lungs, heart, and immune system.3 Therefore, there is a great need to fabricate a highly sensitive
and low-cost Hg sensor that can illustrate the accurate determination
of Hg level in the food, water, and the environment. Several analytical
techniques such as electrochemical sensing, enzymatic techniques,
chemiluminescence, capillary electrophoresis, and spectrofluorometry
are commonly used in this field.4 Nevertheless,
these methods possess several disadvantages such as high cost, hazardous
solvents, labor intensive operation, and the generation of waste products.5 To overcome these issues, analytical methods
using fluorescent probes have attracted more attention in the sensor
field due to their selectivity, speed, and sensitivity. Fluorescence
intensity quenching of the analyte provides biochemical information
in a simple way.6 Various fluorescent materials,
such as carbon quantum dots, organic dyes, organic polymers, metal
nanoparticles, and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), have been
studied.7−9

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), based
on the coordination
of metal cations with organic linkers, form a class of hybrid materials.10 In this class, UiO-66 has been developed with
different pore and cavity diameters and a variety of dimensionally
connected UiO-66 materials have been reported. The well-developed
pores in UiO-66 provide a platform for small molecules and ion pathways
in transformation processes, allowing for the formation of porous
nanostructures.11 UiO-66 has received considerable
attention due to its porosity, surface area, structure, and chemical
stability.12−14 UiO-66 can easily be developed as a possible template
under appropriate conditions.15 These advanced
and unique properties make UiO-66 attractive for various applications
such as chemical sensors, adsorption, drug delivery, gas storage,
and catalysis.16 Recently, nanomaterials
have been fabricated by embedding or encapsulating nanoparticles within
UiO-66; these nanomaterials have received increasing interest for
many applications. The fabricated UiO-66 nanomaterials have been proven
to enhance sensing, catalytic, and electric activity. Noble metals
like copper, silver, and gold and carbon dots have attracted considerable
attention for fabricating nanostructures with UiO-66. Gold nanomaterials
in particular have unique properties, which enhance their functionality
in all applications.11

Gold nanoparticles
and nanoclusters (AuNCs) have received a lot
of attention in the fields of chemistry, biology, and materials.2,17,18 In particular, Au clusters are
subnanometer in size, have fluorescent properties, are biocompatible,
and exhibit an energy transition between the highest occupied molecular
orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels.19 The strong fluorescence of the AuNCs can sense
the target molecules with single-particle sensitivity.20 Proteins can play a major role in the synthesis
of subnanometer-sized AuNCs under mild conditions, as thiol, amine,
and carboxyl groups present in the protein can be used as reducing
and stabilizing agents.21 On the basis
of this unique property, the fluorescence quenching effects of gold
have been used to detect a limited set of analytes, including Hg2+, Cu2+, and CN–.22 Several procedures are available to synthesize
AuNCs using DNA, polymers, ligands, and dendrimers as a template.23 In the latter, bovine serum albumin (BSA) has
been found to stabilize the metal ions at subnanometer size. BSA reacts
with Au3+ ions and reduces them into Au+ ions
with the help of biomolecules present in the protein.24 Recent studies suggest that forces between closed-shell
atoms are physically powerful; this can particularly affect the interactions
between Hg2+ and Au+.25

The aim of this research is to develop highly fluorescent,
ecofriendly,
and small-sized gold nanoclusters incorporated into a UiO-66 framework
and illustrate highly fluorescent (red) emission at 650 nm. The synthesized
nanocomposite has a lot of advantages such as high sensitivity, stability,
and cost-effectiveness. We demonstrate that the synthesized nanocomposite
can detect Hg2+ metal ions in both river and tap water
samples via fluorescence intensity quenching.

Experimental Section
Materials
Zirconium chloride (Aldrich, 99.8%), 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic
acid (H2BDC, Aldrich, 99%), HCl (Aldrich, 37%), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, Aldrich), gold(III)
chloride trihydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O), sodium
hydroxide (NaOH), hydrochloride human serum albumin, mercury nitrate
monohydrate (Hg(NO3)2·H2O),
and other metal ions were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Instrumentation
Synthesized AuNCs@UiO-66 samples were
diluted in deionized water for taking dark field images using a Photon
Technology International (PTI) UV illuminator at 365 nm. The prepared
materials were diluted well, and their UV spectra were measured using
a Varian Cary 100 UV–vis spectrophotometer. High-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were taken using Tecnai
G2 F30 Series, the final nanoanalysis system that was set with a 300
kV Schottky FEG, with a high maximum beam current, patented S-TWIN
objective lens, 0.102 nm of line resolution, 0.17 nm of high-resolution
scanning TEM resolution, and 0.20 nm of point resolution, which was
purchased from Hillsboro, OR. Photoluminescence (PL) fluorescence
spectra were analyzed at an excitation wavelength of 450 nm using
a fluorescence spectrometer (QuantaMaster, Photon Technology International,
NJ) equipped with a xenon lamp (Arc Lamp Housing, A-1010B), monochromator,
and power supply (Brytexbox). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of
the nanocomposites were acquired using a Rigaku Rint 2200 Series X-ray
automatic diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation at a wavelength of
1.5406 Å) from Rigaku, TX. A Bruker vortex high-resolution 70
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer, equipped with BRUKER
FTIR Vertex 70 with microplate extension high throughput screening
extension and attenuated total reflection units, from Billerica, MA,
was used to analyze FTIR spectra of the synthesized nanocomposite.
The overall fluorescence lifetime decay curves were obtained using
a Photon Technology International (PTI) EL series of nanosecond pulsed
light-emitting diodes designed for the EasyLife II excitation wavelength
ranging from 260 to 650 nm. For the background signal, we have used
silica suspension in water, and the instrument response function was
recorded using a 1% LUDOX LS. The curve fitting data were obtained
using EasyLife II via a serial RS232 and USB connection under the
control of the EasyLife II program.

Synthesis of UiO-66
UiO-66 was synthesized in accordance
with previously reported methods with some modification.26,27 A mixture of zirconium chloride (Aldrich, 99.8%), 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic
acid (H2BDC, Aldrich, 99%), and HCl (Aldrich, 37%) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, Aldrich) was
prepared by stirring. After that, the mixture was transferred to a
Teflon-lined autoclave and kept at 393 K for 24 h in a conventional
oven.

Synthesis of AuNCs@UiO-66
The AuNCs@UiO-66 samples
were synthesized by mixing 5 mL of UiO-66 (50 mg/mL in ethanol) with
5 mL of HAucl4 and adding the mixture to BSA solution (50
mg/mL, 5 mL) and then stirred at 800 rpm. After 30 min, sodium hydroxide
(1 M, 500 μL) was added and the solution was kept at 50 °C
and vigorously stirred for 3–4 h. The color started to change
from pale yellow to light brown. This color change indicates that
AuNCs@UiO-66 was synthesized. Powder samples were collected by freeze-drying
and used for further experiments.

Results and Discussion
Characterization
of AuNCs@UiO-66
Figure 1a presents the UV–vis spectroscopy
analysis of UiO-66 and the AuNCS@UiO-66 composite. The absorption
band of UiO-66 is located at 320 nm; it could be caused by ligand-to-metal
charge transfer. After the introduction of AuNCs, a small peak is
present at the same position and another peak observed at 340 nm indicates
the presence of AuNCs in UiO-66. In Figure 1b, we display the fluorescence spectra of
the synthesized AuNCs@UiO-66 in PBS buffer. Deep red fluorescence
was observed at 650 nm (emission) from an excitation wavelength of
450 nm. The inset image (i) shows the AuNCs@UiO-66 nanocomposite under
visible light. Inset image (ii) shows the strong red fluorescence
of AuNCs@UiO-66 under UV illumination. The synthesized AuNCs@UiO-66
nanocomposite exhibits a better quantum yield of 11%. In Figure 2a, we show the fluorescence
intensity of AuNCs@UiO-66 under different excitation wavelengths and
its pH stability. When the excitation wavelength was gradually changed
by 20 nm from 340 to 600 nm, the PL peak red-shifted and the intensity
also changed rapidly. The excitation-dependent PL characteristics
of the different emission spectra are the result of the localization
of electron hole pairs due to the isolated sp2 clusters
within the sp3 matrix.28 However,
we have analyzed the optimum pH for this sensing experiment (Figure 2b). A pH of 7.2 gives
higher intensity than other pH values, and moreover, the synthesized
AuNCs@UiO-66 nanocomposite was constant from 5 to 11 pH. Therefore,
the whole experiment was done at pH 7.2.

Figure 3a shows
the powder XRD patterns for the AuNCs@UiO-66 nanocomposite compared
to those for UiO-66. These results ensure that the crystallinity of
UiO-66 is maintained after the formation of the composite with AuNCs
is formed; distinct peaks were observed for AuNCs@UiO-66. This result
suggests that the parent UiO-66 was well preserved during the in situ
synthesis of AuNCs. The distinct 2θ peaks for UiO-66 were confirmed
at around 7 and 8°, belonging to the (111) and (002) lattice
planes. The same peaks were observed after the incorporation of AuNCs
into UiO-66. The peak at around 46° for the (111) plane corresponds
to the BSA–AuNCs. Moreover, further evidence that UiO-66 is
well conjugated with the AuNCs was obtained from the FTIR spectrum
in Figure 3b. The peak
at around 1600 cm–1 represents the organic aromatic
linkers in UiO-66.29 The peak at 1190–1240
cm–1 represents the −SO3H group,
and the same peak is present in the composite with AuNCs. The −C–H,
−OH, and −N–H stretching frequencies in the range
of 2955–3300 cm–1 originate from the conformation
of the AuNCs.

Morphology and elemental analyses
of UiO-66 and AuNCs@UiO-66 were
carried out by HRTEM (Figure 4). However, it is very difficult to acquire high-quality images
of small-size (1–3 nm) gold nanoclusters due to the size of
the electron beam. Figure 4a displays a low-magnification image of AuNCs@UiO-66, and
the AuNCs are well dispersed on the surface of UiO-66.30,31 Moreover, the high-resolution TEM (Figure 4b) clearly shows that some of the AuNCs enter
into the UiO-66 and some of them are present on the surface of UiO-66;
the yellow circle and lines highlight the AuNCs present in UiO-66.
An energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) chemical map taken from
the AuNCs@UiO-66 is shown in Figure 4c. From this image, it can be seen that the Au is completely
conjugated with Zr in UiO-66. The overall TEM image clearly shows
that AuNCs were fully functionalized with UiO-66.

Here, we point the AuNCs in UiO-66 as yellow circles and arrows.

Detection of Mercury
We explored the feasibility of
using the AuNCs@UiO-66 nanocomposite for the detection of Hg2+. AuNCs@UiO-66 exhibits a strong fluorescence at 650 nm in the absence
of Hg2+. The AuNCs@UiO-66 fluorescence intensity was constantly
quenched when Hg2+ concentration was increased from 800
nM to 10 μM (Figure 5a), and explicit PL quenching by 64% was observed after the
addition of Hg2+ to the AuNCs@UiO-66. The PL quenching
ratio (F0 – F/F0) at 450 nm was fitted to a linear function
of Hg2+ ion concentration from 800 nM to 10 μM, with
a high linear coefficient (R2 = 0.996),
which coincidences with a detection limit of 77 pM (Figure 5b). A comparison of detection
performance of various sensors toward Hg2+ is illustrated
in Table 1. This observation
indicates that Hg2+ are able to suppress the fluorescence
of AuNCs@UiO-66, presumably via electron or energy transfer. The fluorescence
quenching is illustrated by the Stern–Volmer equation.32 1  Here, F0 and F are the fluorescence quenching intensities in the absence
and presence of metal ion, Kq represents
the affinity between the fluorophore and the quenching ion by means
of the Stern–Volmer constant, and [M] is the concentration
of Hg2+. The sensitivity of Hg2+ was evaluated
depending on the detection limit value. The detection limit was calculated
by the following equation 2  Here, σ
is the standard deviation of
the least concentration and m is the slope of the
concentration-dependent response.33

Selectivity of AuNCs@UiO-66
toward Other Metal Ions
To estimate the selectivity of the
fluorescence quenching sensor
system, we measured the difference in the PL intensity of AuNCs@UiO-66
with various metal ions such as As3+, Co2+,
Cd2+, Hg2+, Cr2+, Ni2+, Fe3+, Pb2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+ under the same conditions (Figure 5c). The developed sensor should exhibit not only high
sensitivity but also augmented specificity. The prepared metal ions
were incubated for 10 min, and PL analysis was carried out at 450
nm excitation wavelength. The PL intensity of AuNCs@UiO-66 was quenched
(∼91%) with 10 μM Hg2+. The PL of AuNCs@UiO-66
showed much lesser intensity in the presence of Hg2+ compared
to that in the presence of the rest of the metal ions. Zirconium oxide
could be considered as an active metal node of UiO-66. The mechanism
behind the detection of Hg2+ by AuNCs@UiO-66 is mainly
the easy binding of Hg2+ ions to the chemically active
sites on the UiO-66 framework.34 Moreover,
the physical properties of the AuNCs@UiO-66 sensor, such as the organic
nature of UiO-66, its high surface area, its morphology, and size
of the particle, are significant for the detection of the target ion
and its binding to the sensor.

Detection Performance of
AuNCs@UiO-66 toward Hg2+ in Real Water Samples
For the realistic application of
the synthesized AuNCs@UiO-66-based sensor, various concentrations
of Hg2+ ranging from 1 to 4 μM were spiked into river
and tap water samples. The environmental aqua samples were collected
from river (Hangang) and tap water (Gachon University) (Seoul, South
Korea) sources. The river water samples were filtered with 5 mm qualitative
filter paper to remove impurities and centrifuged at 10 000
rpm for 30 min before the experiments. The quenching efficiency (F0/F) showed a better linear
correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.9907)
with respect to the different concentrations of Hg2+, as
shown in Figure 6a.
The limit of detection was achieved at 193 pM by AuNCs@UiO-66 in river
water (Figure 6b).
Furthermore, recovery values of the spiked river water sample are
obtained ranging from 101.6 to 98.5% (Table 2).

The tap water samples
were spiked with Hg2+ in concentrations
ranging from 1 to 4 μM (Figure 7a). A plot of F0 – F/F0 against the spiked Hg2+ concentration shows a linear squared correlation of 0.983
(Figure 7b), and the
limit of detection was achieved at 223 pM. The calculated recovery
values of Hg2+ in the spiked tap water samples are shown
in Table 3.

Fluorescence Quenching
Mechanism of AuNCs@ UiO-66 for Hg2+
The fluorescence
quenching mechanism of synthesized
AuNCs@UiO-66 in the presence of Hg2+ metal ions is shown
in Figure 8. The fluorescence
decay curves can be built in a double exponential function using the
following equation 3  where D is the PL decay,
τ is the lifetime, τi is the
PL lifetime of different fluorescent types, and ai is the equivalent pre-exponential factor.35 Bare AuNCs@UiO-66 shows lifetimes of τ1 = 12.01 and τ2 = 7.07 ns in the absence
of Hg2+ metal ions. After the addition of Hg2+, a drastic decrease in the lifetimes of 5.30 and 0.58 ns was observed
for τ1 and τ2, respectively, due
to electron transfer. This decrease in lifetime clearly indicates
that electrons transferred to the LUMO energy level from the conduction
band due to the Hg2+ metal ion.36 Moreover, we have investigated the interaction between AuNCs and
Hg2+ by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Figure 9). The survey scan
clearly shows the presence of C, Au, N, Hg, and O (Figure 9a). The peaks located at around
84.13 and 87.5 eV, corresponding to Au 4f, were allocated to metallic
gold (Au0), and the peaks at around 85.7 and 90.01 were
assigned to ionic gold (Au+) (Figure 9b).37,38 In Figure 9c, the peaks at 100.9 and 104.2
eV for Hg 4f spectrum corresponded to metallic mercury (Hg0).39,40 These results indicate that the Hg2+ ions were reduced by AuNCs and formed a Au–Hg amalgam.41 Therefore, it is predictable here that the amino
group containing BSA performs the fluorescence quenching after interaction
of Hg2+ ions with BSA and Hg2+ ions, binding
them tightly to each other.

Conclusions
We
have developed high red fluorescence AuNCs incorporated in UiO-66
frameworks with a high QY (11%). The AuNCs were well dispersed, spherical
in shape, and 2 nm in size on average. Due to the porosity and surface
area of UiO-66, the AuNCs were homogeneously distributed along the
UiO-66 framework. The AuNCs@UiO-66 nanocomposite shows high Hg2+ detection sensitivity (77 pM) and also high sensitivity
to the real water samples, including river and tap water, with the
limit of detection being 193 and 223 pM, respectively, and high levels
of recovery. The developed sensor may prove useful because of the
simple procedure, high fluorescence, and selective sensitive methods
to detect the Hg2+ ions and also be advantageous for applications
in nanotechnology and other biosensor fields.
