This
paper presents a new algorithm (INNOV) capable of generating
a mesh of three-dimensional objects containing multiple phases. This
mesh can later be imported into commercial or open-source software
to perform multiphysics-based simulations based on partial differential
equations. While the range of application is large, this algorithm
is designed as a post-processing tool of micro/nanotomography images
and electrode mesostructures predicted from CGMD (coarse-grained molecular
dynamics) simulations of the electrode fabrication process carried
out in LAMMPS software. With INNOV, it becomes possible to import
the predicted multiparticle electrode mesostructures into COMSOL Multiphysics
in order to simulate electrochemistry and transport in operating lithium-ion
batteries.

1 Introduction
Despite
the rapid success of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), most
of the technical progresses reached during the past years have arisen
from trial-and-error approaches without a deep theoretical understanding
of the detailed operation mechanisms behind them. Nonetheless, in
order to reduce the fabrication costs and further optimize batteries
in regards to their integration in the transportation sector, the
development of predictive mechanistic models is critically needed.1−3

Among the most used mechanistic modeling approaches, the so-called
pseudo-2D (P2D) model dominates since many years the continuum simulation
studies of LIBs since its introduction by Newman and co-workers.4,5 However, P2D models cannot capture the impact of the 3D electrode
mesostructure and associated anisotropy on the LIB cell behavior.
The electrode mesostructure, characterized by its pore network, the
active material (AM) and thecarbon–binder domain (CBD) particle
location and resulting pore network, drives the electrochemical performance
of the cell (see Figure S1, Supporting
Information).

In the last 10 years, there has been a sharp rise
of 3D-resolved
electrochemical models in the scientific community on multiple chemistries.6−9 Used electrode mesostructures are either computer-generated by using
random location algorithms (e.g., GeoDict software) or obtained by
computer tomography. However, reported 3D-resolved models rely on
oversimplifications, such as an implicit representation of the CBD
through the use of effective parameters for porosity and tortuosity10,11 or by merging CBD with the active material (AM) as a single solid
phase.12

Because of the disparate
spatial scales, meshing an explicit representation
of CBD and AM would be like trying to paint with the same paintbrush
a rock and a mountain next to each other. Either the paintbrush is
too wide or is too fine. In the first case, the time needed to paint
the mountain will be short but the rock geometry will appear as deformed.
In the second case, the rock will retain its apparent geometry but
the time needed to paint the mountain will be extremely long.

In the case of an adaptive mesh, the complexity relies on assembling
a coarser and a finer mesh together. Where the AM and the CBD are
in contact, the elements of the mesh of the AM should be finer to
match the ones of the CBD. This task is challenging to do at each
interface between AM and CBD phases.

This work reports a computationally
efficient and versatile algorithm
capable of meshing multiple phases by using voxelization. The algorithm
has been named INdefinite Number Of phases meshing through Voxelization
(INNOV). This algorithm is able to import a multiphase volumetric
mesh into COMSOL Multiphysics benefiting from the native format improvement
in the latest update (COMSOL 5.4,13 January
2019).

In this paper, INNOV is illustrated through its application
to
a LIB composite electrodes predicted by using coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) using LAMMPS
software.19 Such composite electrodes are
made of AM particles with multiple sizes (radius of 1.4–9.4
μm) and CBD particles (radius of 0.65 μm). This is useful
in order to implement multiscale modeling workflows able to predict
the impact of the manufacturing process on the battery performance,
as carried out in the scope of the ARTISTIC project.14 However, the algorithm can be applied to a wider spectrum
of scientific fields.

2 Results and Discussion
In this section, we discuss the results of INNOV applied to a three-phased
LiNiMnCo electrode (AM + CBD + void) generated from CGMD calculations
using LAMMPS software, as explained in the article of Ngandjong et
al.10 and Rucci et al.20 In this case, the input is a text file with coordinates
of the centers and radii of each of the particles (see Figure S3).

2.1 Meshing
Once the
binary stacks of
images are generated, a precision of [4 4 3] is set to decrease the
computational cost (see Section 4). Time-efficient meshing is achieved due to the simplicity
of the operations and an optimization through a matrix formalism in
MATLAB. The meshes represented in Figure 1 both have 339 067 nodes, 371 213 faces,
and 1 737 665 elements. The unsmoothed mesh has been generated in
4.48 s on a desktop computer (32 Gb RAM).

generated (a) without smoothing and (b)
with smoothing. The spherical active material particles are in red,
and the carbon–binder domains are in yellow.

The voxelization technique is known for its staircase
shape, so
the algorithm embeds a smoothing option, which relies on Kroon’s
function.15,16 It is noteworthy that the smoothing algorithm
tends to shrink the volume of the elements, resulting in a slight
increase in the porosity (for the example here, 49.69% before and
50.07% after smoothing).

2.2 Observables
The
core of this work
is to increase the current level of precision in the modeling of battery
cell electrodes by separating the active and inactive materials. In
doing so, one must not sacrifice the integrity of the mesostructure
geometry. To ensure this, INNOV provides a number of observables,
which can be compared to the experimental numbers (e.g., arising from
tomography characterizations).

Among them, two distinct values
of porosity are displayed by INNOV: the porosity of the mesh and the
porosity of the stack of images. In the example provided in this study,
the porosity of the stack is 50.1%, and the porosity of the resulting
mesh is 49.7%. Furthermore, the volume ratio of each phase in the
mesh is compared to its value in the stack of images in Table 1. This can render proof of the
overall volume conservation of each phase; however, these are average
values and cannot highlight local deformations within the mesh. Here,
the meshing step introduces an error below 2% on the volume of each
phase, which is considered satisfactory in our study. Another useful
insight is the surface coverage between different phases. For example,
the surface area of the interfaces between the active material and
CBD (36.2%) or the active material and electrolyte (63.8%) are provided
once the mesh is done.

3 Conclusions
We report
a flexible MATLAB-based algorithm (INNOV) to tackle the
meshing process and importation of multiphase objects in computational
frameworks for multiphysics simulations based on sets of partial differential
equations. From a selection of input format, INNOV generates a volumetric
mesh able to contain an unlimited number of phases. This mesh can
then be converted into the desired format to suit a variety of commercial
and open-source software. INNOV embeds a set of observables to ensure
the geometric integrity of the structure after the meshing step. While
designed for the battery field, this algorithm can be applied to a
wide spectrum of scientific fields. It offers a time-efficient tool
to perform meshing without requiring substantial computational resources.

4 Methods
The INNOV algorithm embeds as its segmentation
method the mathematical
approach of Nielson and Franke17 (Figure 2) and a function
of the open-source program Iso2Mesh18 to
remove duplicated nodes. This segmentation method has been translated
and optimized for MATLAB language and modified to suit the COMSOL
Multiphysics meshing importation process. For instance, this new algorithm
could lead to considering explicitly the complex CBD morphology in
an electrode performance model, which has not yet been reported in
the battery field to the knowledge of the authors.

Figure 2 Algorithmic workflow
of INNOV with the inputs of each step.

4.1 Inputs of INNOV
The algorithm takes
as input the binary stack of images. Such a stack of images can result
from different processes. First, it can be generated from a various
selection of imaging tools, such as the segmentation of tomography
data. Second, binary images can be obtained through the slicing of
3D object files. Finally, the origin can be a file with the coordinates
of particles, centers, and radii. This algorithm has been designed
to receive as input the coordinates arising from CGMD simulations
of the LIB electrode fabrication process. A specific function converts
this input into binary images to feed the algorithm with and to reconstruct
the electrodes (see Figure S2).

4.2 Node Generation
In the voxelization
technique, each node is related to a pixel in the segmented images
so each node is coded with a particle type depending on its phase
(AM, CBD, electrolyte, separator, etc.). The node generation is the
computational time-limiting step due to the number of faces and elements,
which increases with the number of nodes. Since the number of nodes
is equal to the number of pixels, aiming for high-resolution images
can be a double-edged sword. To address this specific issue, the function
embeds an anisotropic downsizing tool in the form of a “precision”
parameter. This can be scalar (isotropic) or vector (anisotropic),
indicating the downsizing factor along each axis, that is, one node
out of how many will be saved for the node generation. While slightly
losing in precision, the gain in time can be tremendous. Taking a
given electrode structure with three phases (AM, CBD, and electrolyte)
with an input stack of images (201 × 200 × 179 pixels),
the computation times for the generation of the mesh are 177.20 s
without downsizing and 4.48 s with a precision of [4 4 3].

Going
further, a more relevant observation would be that the simulation
time (which can be up to several days in some cases) of the downsized
mesh will also decrease compared to the original one. Indeed, the
downsized mesh has more than 1.5 million elements, while the mesh
without downsizing has more than 48 million elements. An example of
the impact of downsizing is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Slices of a mesh (left)
without downsizing (precision = 1) and
(right) with downsizing (precision = 5). AM is in green, CBD is in
yellow, and void is in purple.

Previously in this communication were presented the INNOV-calculated
observables to account for the integrity of the structure geometry
after the meshing. Finally, a scale factor parameter (ratio m/pixel)
ensures the geometric dimensions of the structure.

4.3 Element Generation
The voxelization
divides the space into voxels based on 4 pixels of an image and the
4 pixels associated on the next slide. Which means that a cubic element
is generated from 4 nodes of a layer and the 4 nodes associated on
the next layer (see Figure S3). In a 3D
mesh, elements can be of different shapes; in the algorithm, they
are tetrahedrons, which is a classical choice due to their efficiency
(4 nodes/elements). The cubic elements need to be divided into tetrahedrons,
and the function offers two different decompositions: into five or
six tetrahedrons. On the one hand, the decomposition into six tetrahedrons
is more precise and easier to implement since the decomposition into
five tetrahedrons requests for some additional operations, as discussed
in the original paper of Nielson and Franke.17 On the other hand, the computational cost will be higher as it will
result in more elements.

4.4 Algorithm
The
voxelization addresses
the issues at the interface by meshing every phase all at once. In
that way, the surface meshes at the interfaces are, by design, the
same across a given interface between two different phases. To do
so, it has to distinguish between four different cases depending on
the phases of the nodes of a given element. A trivial one is when
all nodes belong to the same phase, no decomposition is needed and
the element is retained. The three others occur when the nodes belong
to different phases and demand for a decomposition into several more
tetrahedrons and the creation of triangular faces to effectively separate
the phases. Which means that the more intricate the phases are, the
more surface area there is between them, and the higher the number
of elements and faces.

4.5 Importation
A nontrivial step in
the modeling process is the importation of a mesh into outside software.
Whether due to the formalism of the format or its lack of documentation,
one must tread carefully when converting a mesh. The algorithm presented
here performs a successful importation of the mesh in the native format
(mphtxt) of COMSOL Multiphysics software.

INNOV takes full advantage
of the “Selections” feature in COMSOL 5.4,13 which allows the user to create automatically
the selections of faces and elements in the text file. In this case,
manual selections would have been prohibitory since there are typically
thousands of domains and boundaries in the imported mesh in COMSOL.
The “Selections” feature provides access to every domain
or boundary of interest to apply partial differential equations representing
physical mechanisms in COMSOL.
