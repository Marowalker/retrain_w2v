A bilayered rare-earth-based metal–insulator–semiconductor,
Dy2O3@SiO2@ZnO core–shell
nanospheres, was synthesized by a stepwise synthesis for enhanced
visible photocatalytic activity. The prepared material was characterized
by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, ultraviolet–visible
diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, field-emission scanning electron
microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy, selected area electron diffraction, atomic force
microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller,
and electron paramagnetic resonance techniques. Dy2O3@SiO2@ZnO core–shell nanospheres were found
be in a spherically arranged cauliflower-like morphology (40–60
nm). The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy analysis
proved the core–shell morphology of the prepared material with
a single Dy2O3 core and two shells comprising
SiO2 and ZnO. The material possessed a surface roughness
of 4. 98 nm (2 × 2 μm area) and a band gap energy of 2.82
eV. The in situ generation of OH radicals was confirmed by electron
paramagnetic resonance. Electron hopping through the SiO2 layer from ZnO to Dy2O3 played a major role
in trapping electrons in the f-shells of lanthanides, thus, preventing
the recombination of electron–hole pair. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy studies proved the band alignment of the material. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
analysis further showed the core–shell surface area was 14
m2/g. The visible photocatalytic activity was tested against
2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid), an endocrine disruptor. The
kinetic studies showed that the photocatalytic degradation process
followed a pseudo-first-order pathway. The photocatalyst was found
to be reusable even up to the third cycle.

Introduction
Nanocrystalline semiconductors are often employed as suitable materials
for light-induced photocatalytic processes.1,2 Metal
oxides, such as ZnO, TiO2, SnO2, Bi2O3, WO3, CeO2, etc., are widely
studied for their photocatalytic activity in the UV and visible regions.3−7 Although, a number of nanomaterials are active in the UV region,
advancements toward the development of modified materials for visible-light-induced
photocatalysis have gained importance since the discovery of a TiO2-based photocatalyst for water splitting reactions by Fujishima
and Honda in 1972.8 Because of the consciousness
of energy crisis in developed and developing countries, a material
active in the visible region could be employed widely as a solar photocatalyst.
The solar energy spectrum consists of nearly 46% visible, 5–7%
ultraviolet, and 47% infrared radiation.9 Hence, band gap energy (Eg) of the semiconductor
materials need to be improvised or modified to absorb visible light
for photocatalytic applications.10−12 Researchers across the
globe are in search of alternative techniques to modify the Eg of semiconductor metal oxide nanoparticles.
These modifications could be carried out by doping of metals,13−15 nonmetals,16,17 and rare-earth materials18−21 and preparation of mixed metal oxides,22,23 graphene-based materials,24 and core–shell
nanocomposites.25−28 Although TiO2-based materials have been widely employed
for photocatalysis, certain weaknesses, such as stability, cost, and
quantum efficiency, have led to ZnO emerging as a suitable alternative.29

Core–shell nanomaterials are nanocomposites
that consist
of a core material and a material that surrounds the core creating
a shell-like structure. Nobel metals, such as Au, Ag, Pd,30−32 and metal oxides, such as Fe2O3 or ZnO,33,34 are often employed as the core, and SiO2, TiO2, or polymers35−37 are often employed as shell materials. Noble metals
easily form colloidal solution, facilitating the preparation of core,
and the organic precursors of SiO2 and TiO2 are
common and could easily surround the core, forming the shell material.35,36 Some of the examples of visible-light-active core–shell nanocomposites
are N-doped ZnO/g-C3N4,38 BiVO4@Bi2O3,39 CdS@TaON,27 and Ag@Fe3O4@SiO2@TiO2.40 Recently, it has been shown by various research groups
that the incorporation of rare-earth materials in semiconductors enhance
the photocatalytic activity of the material because of the presence
of f-orbitals in lanthanides.41 Lanthanide
materials are well-known insulators, but the presence of f-shells
contributes toward the trapping of electrons on irradiation when developed
in combination with other semiconductor materials.41−43 Thus, leaving
the holes in the valence band of the semiconductor to react with water
molecules for the production of hydroxyl radicals to initiate the
photodegradation reaction of the target molecules.

Doping of
lanthanides on ZnO, TiO2, WO3,
etc., have been widely attempted, also very recently doping of ZnO
on lanthanide material have been carried out by our research group.41 Hence, the present study accounts for the first
report employing rare-earth material as a core material for investigations
on photocatalytic activity. ZnO was chosen as a shell material as
ZnO is a widely applied semiconductor for photocatalytic application.
But, the stability of ZnO is a challenging factor; hence, enhancing
the stability by forming a core–shell material is investigated.
Also, SiO2 has been employed widely as a core–shell
material because of the ease of preparation and cost.35 Hence, in this Article, to enhance the activity of ZnO,
we have synthesized Dy2O3 as core and formed
SiO2 and ZnO as the subsequent shell layers. The proposed
preparation of a rare-earth-based MIS (rare-earth metal/insulator/semiconductor)
(REMIS) sequence is a similar structural sequel to MIS (metal–insulator–semiconductor)
nanojunction widely applied for hydrogen evolution in photoelectrochemical
cells, photoelectrodes, photodetectors, etc.44−46 In MIS nanojunction,
upon light irradiation, the excited electron from the conduction band
of the semiconductor passes through the thin layer of insulator to
the metal layer by electron tunneling via an electron hopping mechanism.46 The insulator layer often employed is SiO2; because of the presence of defect sites in SiO2,47 the excited electron from the semiconductor
layer are transported to the metal layer by hopping of electrons through
SiO2. Hence, in the present study, the rare-earth metal@insulator@semiconductor
(REMIS) prepared may act through a similar mechanism for enhancing
the photocatalytic activity.

Semiconductor photocatalysts have
a variety of applications, which
include solar cells, sensors, luminescence material, upconversion
agents, oxidation/reduction catalysts, photocatalytic degradation
of organics, photocatalytic water splitting, etc.48−54 Because there is an enormous increase in the rate of environmental
pollution, in particular water pollution, there is a global alarm
in the enforcement of improved technologies for the treatment of emerging
contaminants. Contamination of water bodies is often caused by discharges
from chemical, pharmaceutical, tanneries, and textile industries and
from the agricultural sector due to water runoff.55 The most important effluent that threaten mankind are dyes
and endocrine-disrupting agents because they are often toxic and carcinogenic.55 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) is a
commonly employed herbicide in the agricultural sector, which contributes
to the contamination of water bodies due to runoff from farmlands
sprayed with herbicides.56 2,4-D has been
classified as an endocrine disrupting agent,57 and the LD50 for rat is found to be 100–500 mg/kg.58 The toxicity of 2,4-D in humans has been studied
by various scientific communities and is known to cause a disruption
in energy production by the depletion of the primary energy molecule
ATP (adenosine triphosphate).59,60 2,4-D is also known
to interfere with the
functions of serotonin and dopamine (neurotransmitters); mostly in
young organisms, this exposure would result in the delay of brain
development and abnormal behavioral patterns, for example, immobility,
tremor, apathy, and repetitive movements. Studies suggested that females
are more prone to be affected than males.61,62

Therefore, the present investigation is mainly focused on
the synthesis
of a highly visible active Dy2O3@SiO2@ZnO (DSZ) core–shell nanosphere for the degradation of an
endocrine disruptor 2,4-D. The prepared photocatalyst were characterized
by FT-IR, XRD, UV–vis DRS, FE-SEM, EDAX, HR-TEM, SAED, XPS,
BET, and EPR techniques. The photocatalytic activity of the prepared
DSZ for the degradation of 2,4-D under visible light irradiation were
carried out. The preliminary studies on the effect of pH, catalyst
dosage, variation of initial 2,4-D concentrations, and the kinetics
of photocatalytic degradation with respect to time were conducted.
The reaction followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. The degradation
processes were monitored by UV–visible absorbance measurement
and decrease in COD of the solution. Recyclability studies were conducted,
and the core–shell nanosphere was found to be reusable even
up to the third cycle of usage. The efficiency of the prepared DSZ
was compared with pristine ZnO.

Results and Discussion
Characterization
of the Prepared Core–Shell Nanosphere
by FT-IR and XRD
The prepared DSZ core–shell nanosphere,
pristine Dy2O3, and ZnO were characterized by
FT-IR analysis, and the results are shown in Figure S1. A band at 492 cm–1 appeared due to the
presence of Zn–O stretching in the prepared ZnO (Figure S1i). Dy2O3 showed
bands around 567 and 473 cm–1 due to the presence
of Dy–O in the prepared material (Figure S1ii). Figure S1iii shows the presence
of stretching vibrations due to the presence of Zn–O and Dy–O
at 557 and 470 cm–1, respectively. A band at 800
and 1094 cm–1 were attributed to the presence of
Si–O stretch, which confirms the presence of SiO2 in the prepared DSZ nanosphere. In addition to these, a broad peak
at 3400 cm–1 were observed in all the spectra, which
corresponds to the O–H stretching vibrations from the surface
hydroxyl groups.

The results were corroborated
with the literature,63−65 which confirms the presence of Zn, Dy, and Si as
oxides in the prepared
DSZ core–shell nanosphere. The crystallinity of the prepared
DSZ nanosphere were examined by XRD, and the results are shown in Figure 1a. The peaks were
found to be sharp and narrow. The hump at 2θ of 10–20°
confirmed the presence of silica in the prepared material. Peaks in
the XRD pattern at (211), (222), (400), (440), and (622) are attributed
to the characteristic planes of Dy2O3 and at
(100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (004), (112), and (201)
are characteristic planes for ZnO, respectively. The diffraction peaks
were compared with the standard patterns (ZnO, JCPDS 36-1451; Dy2O3, JCPDS 01-079-1722).41 Hence, the presence of Dy2O3, ZnO, and SiO2 are further confirmed by XRD analysis. The crystallite size
of the prepared material was calculated using the Scherer eq 2 2  where k is 0.94
for spherical
samples, λ is the wavelength of radiation corresponding to 0.154
nm, β is the full width at half-maximum, and θ is half
the diffraction angle. The crystallite size was found to be in the
nano range of 50–60 nm.

and DSZ and
(b) UV–vis DRS spectra of the prepared ZnO, Dy2O3, and DSZ.

Determination of Band Gap
Energy
The absorption of
light energy photons are an important phenomena in the determination
of photocatalytic activity of any catalyst. The energy required for
the transportation of an electron from the valence band to the conduction
band is determined by the band gap energy of the material. Hence,
the UV–visible DRS results would positively predict the photocatalytic
activities of the prepared catalyst. The absorbance spectrum of the
prepared DSZ core–shell nanosphere are displayed in Figure 1b. The results show
that the maximum absorption occurred around 390–400 nm; in
addition to this, a few peaks were observed around 700–800
nm, which are the characteristic peaks of rare-earth elements. The
f–f transitions of the lanthanide material Dy2O3 present in the sample contributes to this absorption phenomena.
From the UV–vis absorption studies, the band gap energy of
the material was calculate using eq 3 3  where v is the frequency, h is the Planck’s constant, and k equals a constant. The band gap was calculated by plotting (Ahv)2 versus hv. From the plot,
a tangent was drawn, and the intercept of the two lines was taken
as the band gap of the photocatalyst. The band gap energy was found
to be 2.82, 2.98, and 4.63 eV for DSZ, pristine ZnO, and pristine
Dy2O3, respectively (Figure S2). The band gap energy of the prepared DSZ core–shell
photocatalyst was found to decrease after the modifications conducted.
From these results, we can conclude that the band gap energy of the
material is modified effectively toward the formation of a lower band
gap material, which could possibly exhibit better photocatalytic activity.

Surface Morphology by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy
The morphologies of the prepared DS and DSZ are shown in Figures 2 and 3. Both DS and DSZ were found to have spherical morphology. Figure 2a shows the DS to
be spherical with particle size ranging from 30 to 40 nm, consisting
of the elements dysprosium, silica, and oxygen from EDAX spectrum,
and the ratio of atomic dysprosium/silica was found to be 1:2, respectively
(Figure S3). The elemental mapping of the
prepared DS nanosphere is displayed in Figure 2b–d. The mapping studies show the
presence of the Dy, Si, and O on the prepared DS nanosphere. Figure 3a and b shows the
morphology of the prepared DSZ to be spherical in a cauliflower-like
arrangement. The size of the particles varied from 40–60 nm.
The EDAX patterns in Figure S4 shows the
presence of Dy, Si, Zn, and O in the sample. The elemental mapping
further confirms the distribution of the elements in the prepared
DSZ photocatalyst Figure 3c–f.

mapping showing Dy, Si, and O.

High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy
Figure 4 shows the
HR-TEM
images and SAED patterns of the prepared DSZ core–shell nanosphere.

Figure 4 (a) HR-TEM images, (b) SAED pattern, (c) and (d) 2D and 3D AFM
spectra of the prepared DSZ.

The core–shell morphology of the prepared DSZ was
confirmed
from the HR-TEM images as shown in Figure 4a. The size of the DS core was measured to
be ∼38 nm (20 nm Dy2O3 and a 9 nm thick
SiO2 shell layer) and the size of DS core, along with ZnO
shell, was found to be 55 nm. Therefore, the thickness of the ZnO
shell layer is ∼8.5 nm. The core and two shells could be clearly
seen in the image. Since the material has a cauliflower like morphology
the circles of the outer particles clearly show the core–shell
morphology.

One of the outer spheres shows the distinct Dy2O3 core and subsequent SiO2 and ZnO shells
in the
prepared DSZ photocatalyst (inset of Figure 4a). The core–shell morphology could
be clearly evidenced from the HR-TEM analysis. The SAED patterns of
DSZ are shown in Figure 4b.

Analysis of Surface Roughness, Surface Area, and Band Alignment
The atomic force microscopy images of the prepared DSZ are shown
in Figure 4c and d.
The results prove the prepared material to be nanosized and spherical.
The surface roughness profile (Figure S5) shows a number of peaks and troughs on the surface of the core–shell
photocatalyst, which confirms the roughness on the surface, which
would facilitate the absorption of organic moieties thereby initiating
the reaction process. The surface roughness was found to be 4.98 nm
for a 2 × 2 μm area. The BET surface area of the prepared
DSZ were analyzed by the N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherm (Figure S6). The surface area
were calculated to be 14.008 m2/g with an average pore
diameter of 32.9 nm. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results
of the prepared DSZ core–shell photocatalyst is shown in Figure 5. The XPS survey
spectrum shows the emission lines due to the presence of Dy, Zn, Si,
and O in the prepared DSZ core–shell along with a weak C line.

Figure 5 (a) XPS full survey spectrum
and individual spectra of (b) Dy,
(c) Si. and (d) Zn.

Figures 5 and S7 also shows the individual elemental XPS spectra
of all the elements present in the prepared DSZ core–shell
nanosphere. The line at 156.55 eV corresponds to the presence of 4d5/2 orbital of Dy and the line at 103.95 eV is assigned to
the presence of the oxide form of Si 2p in the material. The presence
of Zn in the sample is confirmed by the emission lines at 1021.1 7
and 1044.23 eV due to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 orbitals
of Zn, respectively. A sharp peak centered at around 531.19 eV was
observed, which is due to the presence metal–oxygen bonds present
in the prepared DSZ core–shell nanosphere. The emission line
at 285.05 was attributed to the weak C 1s line. All the results were
corroborated with literature.41,66 Hence, XPS analysis
serves as a support to the presence of Dy, Si, and Zn as oxides in
the prepared core–shell nanomaterial.

Electron Paramagnetic Resonance
Spectroscopy
A photocatalytic
degradation process is generally initiated by a radical mediated mechanism
either in the presence of OH radical or O2•– radical. The generation of radical species in
the photoreaction system were detected by EPR analysis in the presence
of the spin-trapping agent DMPO. Required amount of DSZ, water, and
DMPO were taken in a glass tube and irradiated under visible light
(15 min). Then, the mixture was filtered immediately and transferred
to a EPR flat cell, and the spectrum was recorded. The results are
shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6 EPR spectrum
of the DMPO spin-trapped OH radical formed in the
in situ process by the prepared DSZ.

Characteristic peaks appeared at 3412.41, 3427.14, 3442.37,
and
3457.45 in the intensity ratio of 1:2:2:1, corresponding to the DMPO
spin-trapped OH radical. The g factor was found to
be 2.0037 eV, which is equal to that of a free electron. Hence, this
confirms the in situ generation of OH radicals in the reaction system.

Photocatalytic Activity of Core–Shell Nanosphere
From the characterization results, we can conclude that the prepared
DSZ photocatalyst is crystalline, nanosized, and in a cauliflower-like
core–shell morphology consisting of Dy2O3 core and subsequent shells of SiO2 and ZnO, with a particle
size of 50–60 nm. The band gap energy was found to be 2.82
eV. All these techniques suggested the presence of Dy2O3, SiO2, and ZnO in the prepared nanomaterial with
a core–shell morphology. The material exhibited an absorption
in the visible region at 400 nm, in addition an absorption occurs
at 700–800 nm, which is due to the presence of f–f transitions
present in the f-shells of Dy2O3. Therefore,
upon visible light irradiation of the DSZ core–shell nanomaterial,
the electron from the valence band (VB) of ZnO outer shell (in DSZ)
excites to the conduction band (CB) by absorbing photons of light,
satisfying the band gap energy (2. 82 eV). The prepared material contains
a similar structure to that of MIS nanomaterials,45 wherein a rare-earth material (Dy2O3) is present instead of the metal and SiO2 acts as a thin
insulating layer in between Dy2O3 and semiconductor
material ZnO, therefore, we refer to it as REMIS nanomaterial. Hence,
there would a similar possibility, as in the case of MIS material,
for the transfer of electrons through the insulating layer to the
surface of the rare-earth metal. Hence, the excited electron from
CB of ZnO shell is transferred through the SiO2 layer via
an electron-hopping mechanism46 through
the defects in SiO2 present in the layer near the ZnO/SiO2 interface.47,67,68 This electron-tunneling process allows the electrons to get through
the insulating SiO2 layer to the Dy2O3 core, where it is trapped in the f-shells characteristic of lanthanide
elements. Once the electrons are trapped in the f-shells, the separated
holes in the VB of ZnO are free to react. Thus, the process of recombination
is prevented, and water molecules could easily react with the separated
holes to produce OH radicals, which are active initiators of the photodegradation
process. The mechanism of the photocatalytic activity is represented
in Figure 7. The production
of OH radicals in the in situ process serves as a support for the
proposed mechanism. Hence, the prepared DSZ core–shell would
be photocatalytically active under visible light. In the case of pristine
ZnO, upon light irradiation, the possibilities of the exited electron
in the CB to recombine with the hole in the VB is very high. Hence,
the activity of ZnO would be lesser than that of the prepared DSZ
core–shell. The EPR studies support this proposal because the
time for OH radical production is higher for pristine ZnO (30 min).
Therefore, it is worth studying the photocatalytic activity of the
prepared DSZ core–shell nanosphere.

Figure 7 Mechanism for the photocatalytic
activity of the prepared DSZ photocatalyst.

Photocatalytic Degradation of a Model Pollutant 2,4-D under
Visible Light Irradiation
Photocatalytic Activity of Core–Shell
Nanosphere
Photocatalytic activities of the prepared ZnO,
Dy2O3, DSZ 1:1, DSZ 1:2, DSZ 1:3, and DSZ 1:4
were compared by
analyzing 10 ppm of 2,4-D in 10 mL of solution with a catalyst dosage
of 10 mg, irradiated under visible light. A blank reaction without
catalyst was also studied simultaneously (only irradiation). The results
are shown in Figure S8a. The experimental
analysis revealed the prepared DSZ 1:3 to be the best photocatalyst;
hence, further studies were conducted with DSZ 1:3. Studies on the
effect of pH, initial catalyst dosage, and initial 2,4-D concentrations
were conducted to optimize the experimental parameters. Figure S8b shows the results on the effect of
pH; 10 mg of catalyst in 10 ppm 2,4-D were taken and made up to the
appropriate pH (2–12). Neutral pH showed maximum degradation
(71%) with a minor decrease in other pH ranges. Hence, for ease of
preparation, neutral pH was used for further studies. The catalyst
dosage for the reaction mixtures was optimized by conducting the experiments
with a catalyst dosages between 3 and 20 mg. Figure S8c shows 10 mg of catalyst to result in higher degradation
efficiency. Catalyst dosages above 10 mg resulted in decreased degradation;
this is because upon increased catalyst dosage, the absorption of
the penetrated light inside the reaction is lesser because the light
entering is reflected and not efficiently absorbed by the catalyst
for further reaction. Hence, 10 mg of catalyst per 10 mL of solution
was fixed as the optimum catalyst dosage. Figure S8d shows the plots for the variation of initial 2,4-D concentration
(5–50 ppm). As the concentration of 2,4-D increased, the percentage
of degradation was found to decrease. For 50 ppm of 2,4-D, the percentage
of degradation was nearly 47%.

Kinetic of Photodegradation
of 2,4-D
The kinetics for
the photocatalytic degradation of 2,4-D under visible light irradiation
with the prepared DSZ core–shell photocatalyst were conducted
for 10, 15, 20, and 25 ppm 24-D concentration. The results are shown
in Figure 8a. Aliquots
of sample were collected at regular time intervals, and the UV–visible
absorbance was measured to check the progress of the photoreaction.
The percentage of degradation reached more than 99% in 960, 1200,
1320, and 1440 min, respectively, for 10, 15, 20, and 25 ppm 2,4-D
concentrations, respectively. The kinetics of the reaction was found
to follow a pseudo-first-order kinetics pattern. The pseudo-first-order
plots are shown in Figure 8b. The rate constants were calculated to be 2.56 (10 ppm),
2.20 (15 ppm), 1.86 (20 ppm), and 1.67 × 10–3 min–1 (25 ppm), respectively, and the R2 values were well above 0.998. The progress
of the photoreaction were tested by the reduction in COD levels of
the aliquots of sample collected (Figure 8c).

Figure 8 (a) Plot of kinetics, (b) pseudo-first-order
rate constant, (c)
reduction in COD levels, and (d) the UV–visible absorbance
spectrum of the photocatalytic degradation of 2,4-D by DSZ under visible
light.

The decrease in COD of the sample
proves the degradation of the
2,4-D moiety present. A decrease in COD from 252 to 23 (10 ppm), 504
to 23 (15 ppm), 804 to 63 (25 ppm), and 961 to 126 mg/L (50 ppm) was
observed. The decrease in COD levels depicts the destruction of organic
molecules present in the solution, hence, proving the enhanced photocatalytic
activity of the prepared DSZ core–shell nanosphere.69Figure 8d shows the UV–visible absorbance spectrum of 20 ppm
2,4-D degradation. The aliquots of sample collected were scanned from
200 to 800 nm to confirm the degradation process. The decrease in
absorbance of the characteristic peak of 2,4-D at 282.5 nm shows that
the 2,4-D moiety has completely degraded and that the absorbance reached
zero at the completion of the reaction. This proves that DSZ 1:3 is
a better photocatalyst for the degradation of 2,4-D.

Reusability
Studies
The prepared DSZ 1:3 core–shell
photocatalyst was tested for efficiency by conducting the photodegradation
reaction with the same catalyst up to 3 cycles. The photocatalyst
after the completion of reaction was filtered, dried, and charged
for the next cycle of operation, and this was continued until the
third cycle. The results are shown in Figure 9. The experiments proved that the prepared
core–shell photocatalyst retained its properties even up to
the third cycle of operation. The photocatalytic degradation efficiency
was above 99% in each of the cycles. The reused catalyst was analyzed
for its FT-IR and FE-SEM results, and the results are shown in Figure S9. The results prove that the catalyst
has not changed after the degradation reaction. No new peaks were
observed in the FT-IR spectra (Figure S9a) proving the absence of adsorbed organic moieties on the surface
of the material. And the spectrum was similar to that of the as-prepared
catalyst. The FE-SEM analysis (Figure S9b) also showed the spherical nature of the material, showing that
the catalyst is unchanged after the photocatalytic reaction. Hence,
DSZ is a better catalyst for environmental remediation.

Conclusion
A highly visible active
rare-earth-based MIS-type Dy2O3@SiO2@ZnO core–shell nanosphere material
was prepared by a simple stepwise procedure, and the prepared material
was characterized by FT-IR, XRD, UV–vis DRS, FESEM, EDAX, HRTEM,
AFM, XPS, and EPR techniques. The DS core–shell was prepared
by a CTAB-mediated pathway. The synthesized DS was used as a precursor
for the preparation of the target DSZ core–shell nanosphere.
DS was found to be spherical in shape, whereas the DSZ core–shell
formed a cauliflower-like arrangement. The particle size ranged from
40 to 60 nm and the surface roughness was 4.98 nm for a 2 × 2
μm area. The EDAX pattern, elemental mapping studies, and XPS
spectra confirm the presence of Dy, Si, and Zn as oxides in the prepared
material. The DSZ core–shell possessed a band gap energy of
2.82 eV and was highly active under visible light irradiation. The
recombination of the separated electrons and holes in the CB and VB
of ZnO shell are prevented by electron trapping in the f-shells present
in the Dy2O3 core. The transfer of electrons
from the CB of ZnO to f-shells of Dy2O3 is proposed
to occur through an electron-hopping mechanism through defect sites
present in the insulating SiO2 layer, which is further
followed by the trapping of the electrons in the f-shells of core
Dy2O3. Thus, this leaves behind the separated
hole free to react with water molecules to generate OH radicals. The
in situ generation of OH radicals in the system was also confirmed
by EPR studies. The studies on the photocatalytic degradation of a
model pollutant 2,4-D confirmed the visible light photocatalytic activity.
The reaction followed pseudo-first-order kinetics, and degradation
was confirmed by a reduction in COD level and UV–vis absorption
measurement. The prepared DSZ was found to be reusable even up to
the third cycle of usage without losing its activity. Hence, the prepared
DSZ core–shell nanosphere is a better catalyst of environmental
remediation, and this study paves way for further research on multi-layered
core–shell materials utilizing rare-earth elements for visible
photocatalytic activity and environmental remediation.

from Sigma-Aldrich, India. 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid)
was procured from Agrochemicals Pvt., Ltd., Chennai. Ammonium carbonate,
sodium carbonate, and sodium hydroxide were supplied by Sisco Research
Laboratories, India. Ethanol and hydrochloric acid were procured from
Merck, Mumbai, India. All the chemicals except DMPO were used as received
without further purification. DMPO was purified and checked for purity
before analysis.

Methods
The synthesis of core–shell
nanosphere
was performed in a three-step process.70−72 First, Dy2O3 was prepared by a precipitation technique and was used
for the preparation of Dy2O3@SiO2 (DS) nanosphere. Then the prepared DS was used as the starting material
for the core–shell Dy2O3@SiO2@ZnO (DSZ) core–shell.

Step 1: Preparation of Dy2O3
Dy2O3 was prepared by a precipitation
technique70, employing nitrate as the source
of dysprosium
and sodium carbonate as the precipitating agent. Dy(NO3)2·6H2O (0.1 M)was dissolved in 100 mL
of distilled water. To this solution, under vigorous stirring, 0.1
M Na2CO3 dissolved in 100 mL of distilled water
was slowly added. After the addition was complete, the precipitate
was stirred for a further 30 min. Then, the white precipitate was
filtered, washed, and dried. The dried powder was sintered at 700
°C for 2 h in a muffle furnace. ZnO was prepared by a similar
procedure, employing zinc nitrate instead of dysprosium nitrate.

Step 2: Preparation of Dy2O3@SiO2 Nanospheres
Dy2O3@SiO2 nanospheres were prepared by a typical procedure reported elsewhere.71 Absolute alcohol (250 mL), 60 mL of water, 10.2
mL of aqueous ammonia, and 1.2 mL of TEOS were injected into a 250
mL conical flask. The solution was stirred for 10 min at 40 °C.
Then 1 g of Dy2O3 and 0.6 g of CTAB were sonicated
(25% amplitude, 750W) in 60 mL of distilled water, which was then
added to the above solution. The mixture was continuously stirred
for 12 h at 40 °C. The nanospheres, consisting of silica and
Dy2O3, were then separated by centrifugation
(2000 rpm, 10 min). The solid material was washed with hot deionized
water three times to remove the unreacted CTAB. For each washing,
hot water was added to the material and sonicated for 2 min (25% amplitude,
750 W) to completely disperse the nanoparticles in water. The prepared
Dy2O3@SiO2 material was named DS.

Step 3: Preparation of DSZ Core–Shell Particles
Multilayered
core–shell DSZ was prepared according to a modified
procedure reported elsewhere.72 DS (0.4
g) was dissolved in required amount of water and dispersed ultrasonically
using a sonicator at 25% amp (750 W) for 10 min. After sonication,
1.6176 g of zinc acetate dissolved in 20 mL of distilled water was
added to the solution. Then, 2.83 g of ammonium carbonate was dissolved
in the required amount of water and added dropwise to the above solution
under constant stirring. After the addition was complete, the mixture
was stirred further for 15 min. Then, the precipitate was filtered
and washed with water and, finally, ethanol. The precipitates were
sintered at 300 °C in a muffle furnace. The product obtained
is labeled as DSZ 1:3 (weight of DS (0.4 g): weight of theoretical
ZnO (1.2g)). Similarly, DSZ 1:1, DSZ 1:2, and DSZ 1:4 were prepared
accordingly. The molar ratio of zinc acetate and ammonium carbonate
was maintained as 1:2. The scheme for the preparation of DSZ is shown
in Figure 10.

nanosphere.

Instrumental Analysis
The prepared photocatalysts were
characterized with a Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer
in a scan range of 400–4000 cm–1 (PerkinElmer).
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded in a PAN analytical
X-ray diffractometer (Germany) with Cu Kα radiation in the 2θ
scan range between 10° and 70°. An accelerating voltage
of 40 kV and an emission current of 25 mA were used. The band gap
of the material was analyzed in an ultraviolet visible–diffuse
reflectance spectrometer (UV–vis DRS) (JASCO, model V-650).
The surface morphology of the prepared material were characterized
by field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and energy
dispersive X-ray diffraction (EDAX) (Supra 55-Carl Zeiss, Germany),
atomic force microscope (AFM) (NTEGRA PRIMA-NTMDT, Ireland), and high
resolution–transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) (JEOL
3010). The band alignment studies were recorded by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) (Omicron ESCA Probe spectrometer), and electron
paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments were conducted in a Bruker
model EMX X Band, EPR Spectrometer.

Photocatalytic Experiments
The photocatalytic experiments
under visible light irradiation were conducted in an annular-type
photoreactor supplied by Heber Scientific Company, Ltd., Chennai,
India. The reactor consisted of a tungsten filament lamp (500 W) capable
of emitting visible light, which was used as the irradiation source.
The photocatalytic reactor tubes were made of glass with height ×
diameter of 30 × 1.5 and 30 × 3.5 cm, respectively. The
visible-light-emitting lamp was surrounded with a water jacketed tube,
which was continuously cooled with water circulation to remove the
heat produced by the lamp. Simultaneously, cooling fans were also
provided inside the reactor to dissipate the heat produced. The reactor
contained a port for mounting 12 small tubes (hexagonally arranged)
and 1 large tube at the same time. The small tubes were employed to
conduct the preliminary experiments with a sample volume of 10 mL
made up with the appropriate pH with the required concentration of
catalyst and 2,4-D. The experiments were conducted for 10 h of visible
light irradiation. The kinetics of photodegradation were conducted
with respect to time in a 200 mL volume of the sample in the large
tube of the photoreactor. The progress of the reaction was monitored
any time by the absorbance measurement of the reaction mixture after
filtration. Hence, the residual concentration of the targeted compound
before and after photocatalytic degradation would be easily computed
from the calibration chart, and hence, the percentage degradation
of the dye molecule could be calculated using eq 1. 1  where C0 and Ce are the initial and final concentrations of
2,4-D in the aqueous phase, respectively.
