Conducting polymer actuators have
shown wide application prospects
in the field of biomedical sensors and micro-/nanorobotics. In order
to explore more applications in biomedical sensing and robotics, it
is essential to understand the actuator static behavior from an engineering
perspective, before incorporating them into a design. In this article,
we have established the mathematical model of a trilayer polypyrrole
(PPy) cantilever actuator and validated it experimentally. The model
helps in enhancing the efficiency and in improving the performance,
predictability, and control of the actuator. The thermal expansion
analogy, which is similar to volume change of the multilayer PPy actuator
due to ion migration, has been considered to develop a mathematical
model in COMSOL Multiphysics. To further validate the actuator deformation
predicted by the mathematical modeling, a multilayer PPy actuator
was fabricated by electrochemical synthesis and the experimentally
determined deflection of the actuator was compared to simulation data.
Both the theoretical and experimental results depict that the model
is effective for predicting the bending behavior of multilayer PPy
actuators at different input voltages.

Introduction
As one of the most
common conductive polymers for actuators, polypyrrole
(PPy) has gained much attention due to low operating power and ease
of synthesis.1,2 Compared with the piezoelectric
actuators, the conjugated polymer has a relatively small mechanical
impedance and modulus of elasticity, high sensitivity, high reversibility,
and excellent mechanical properties critical for potential applications
in artificial muscles and sensors.3,4 The trilayer
PPy actuators operates in a liquid as well as in air medium, generate
considerable stress and larger strain output under lower driving power,
and are lightweight and biocompatible in nature.5−7 These advantages
make them attractive for robotic and biomedical domains, including
the biomanipulation, biomimetic systems, biomedical devices, micromanipulation
of living cells, sensing, and as artificial muscles for robotics.8−12

The trilayer PPy actuator is an anion-driven device, and the
deflection
of the actuator is caused by volume change of the conducting polymer
due to the redox reaction.13,14 In a trilayer actuator,
layers of PPy are separated by the porous insulating film made of
polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), which contains an electrolyte inside
the pores. When dc electric voltage is applied on a PPy actuator,
the volume of the PPy film at the positive electrode expands due to
oxidation, whereas the film volume shrinks on the negative side because
of reduction.15 In this redox reaction,
the anions present in the electrolyte transfer to the PPy at the positive
terminal and anions at the negative terminal are expelled from the
PPy, which leads to the bending of the actuator.16 The processing techniques for fabrication of trilayer PPy
actuators have matured; at present, it is necessary to have a quantitative
method to describe the PPy actuator’s actuation performance.
This quantitative method is the basis of feasibility analysis, design
optimization, and actuator control.

There are two basic methods
which have been realized to establish
the quantitative model. The first method is based on diffusive elastic
metal model.17 Subsequent studies coupled
the charge transfer model with solid mechanics to predict the PPy
actuator deflection.18 The second method
is an equivalent model, in which the relation between charge transfer
and strain is assumed to be analogous to a thermal expansion.19,20 This investigation is in line with the latter method to simulate
PPy deflection, adopting the assumption that the thermal–structure
coupling method must be equivalent to the charge transfer. In this
work, we have simulated the trilayer actuator by using equivalent
thermal expansion coefficient and compared the simulation data with
the experimental results. For fabrication of the trilayer actuator,
PPy films doped with trifluoromethanesulfonimide are formed by electrosynthesis
on either side of a gold-coated PVDF membrane. The actuating properties
of the trilayer actuator are investigated and quantified by applying
constant potential. The actuator deflection at various voltages is
compared with the theoretical modeling results. It is found that the
equivalent method is simple and able to predict the deflection of
the PPy actuator, which is very helpful for better design and control
of future conducting polymer actuators.

Results and Discussions
For trilayer actuators, commercially available PVDF films are considered
from EMD Millipore, with pores 0.45 μm in size. Both sides of
the PVDF sheet were sputtered by gold to make a conductive surface
for electrodeposition of the conducting polymer. PVDF membrane (10
× 10 cm2) is mounted on the supporting silicon substrate
by using Kapton tape to achieve the deposition of 8 nm gold on one
side. The same process was used to deposit gold on the other side
of PVDF. To achieve uniform electropolymerization of PPy, the thickness
of the gold layer was set at approximately 8–10 nm, which gives
the resistivity of about 7–8 Ω cm. The conductive polypyrrole
was deposited by the in-house built electrochemical cell, in which
a glass beaker consisting of Au/PVDF acts as a working electrode,
whereas an aluminum mesh acts as a counter electrode. The mesh covered
both sides of Au/PVDF to achieve a uniform coating as shown in Figure 1a. Figures S1 and S2 demonstrate the polymerization setup and
fabrication step of the trilayer PPy actuator. This electrochemical
synthesis was carried out at −16 °C in the presence of
the lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonic)imide (LiTFSi) electrolyte
by using the chronopotentiometry technique. Highly conductive and
crystalline PPy deposition depends upon appropriate voltage and temperature,
which enhance the electrical conductivity, molecular anisotropy, and
uniform morphology. PPy synthesis at lower temperature produces higher
electronic conductivity, longer conjugation length, proper structural
order, and fewer structural defects. Solvents such as dimethylformamide
(DMF), dimethyl sulphoxide, and pyridine impede the anodic electropolymerization
of pyrrole monomer when the pH level is high. Therefore, by considering
the effect of the solvent, a slight amount of water (1%) can substantially
influence the polymerization process and improve the structure and
mechanical properties of the film.21 As
illustrated in Figure 1b, constant 1 mA current is passed in between the working electrode
and counter electrode for 12 h in the presence of the electrolyte,
whereas Figure 1c demonstrated
the output voltage. The voltage transient of PPy polymerization exhibits
different characteristics during the deposition. In the initial period,
a sharp rise of potential is related to the nucleation of the polymer
at the gold-deposited PVDF. In the second stage of polymerization,
a slight decrease of the potential and, eventually, saturation at
some equilibrium level is observed. This transient phase indicates
that the monomer starts polymerizing on the surface of Au/PVDF in
the presence of the LiTFSi electrolyte.21,22Figure 2a shows the typical cross-section
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of as-grown PPy layer on
the Au/PVDF substrate. It is interesting to know that the coating
of PPy film on the Au/PVDF surface is homogenous, compact, and shows
globular structures of about 2–5 μm in size. Generally,
PPy films deposited at 1 mA current for 12 h Are found to be uniformly
thick on both sides and show the cauliflower-type of structure with
different sizes.23,24 The size of features on the surface
gets larger for longer deposition times. In our case, with a 12 h
long deposition, the polymerization period provides good film adhesion
as well as good crystalline structure morphology.13Figure 2b demonstrates the sharp X-ray diffraction (XRD) peak of a PPy-deposited
film at 2θ = 23.1°, with the relative full width at half
maximum at 1.34° and long range XRD with an LiTFSi peak with
PPy as demonstrated in the Supporting Information S3.25 This sharp PPy peak results
from the fact that the average size of crystalline domains increases
with the increase of the polymerization time. However, further increase
of polymerization time leads to more crystallinity due to the increase
of average particle size of PPy. In our case, deposition longer than
12 h reduced the adhesion between the Au/PVDF and PPy, which was easily
peeled out from the substrate.

For displacement measurement, the trilayer actuator was gripped
in between an alligator clip, allowing the application of different
polarity potentials on two sides of the synthesized film. Figure 3a–c shows
the tip displacement of the trilayer actuators on different input
voltages at 50 mHz (10 s positive and 10 s negative potential).

Figure 3 Displacement

0.6 V; (d) current profile of a trilayer actuator at 1.5, 0.8, and
0.6 V, and (e) charge transfer at 1.5, 0.8, and 0.6 V.

The applied potential was a square wave of three
different voltages
(±1, ± 0.8, and ±0.6 V). The 1.5 cm × 0.5 cm rectangular
area of the fabricated actuator was assessed for tip displacement
measurement. At all values of applied potential, tip displacement
tended to increase with the increase of the potential; it is found
that applying voltage in excess of ±1.5 V results in burning
out the grip area and shortening the two terminals. Therefore, the
maximal voltage for tip displacement measurement was kept at 1.5 V,
at which the bending was as large as 12 mm, whereas at 0.8 and 0.6
V, bending of 6 and 3 mm, respectively, was observed.

The difference
in actuation behavior of PPy actuators has been
attributed to mass transfer rates and Young’s moduli being
different at different voltages. At 1.5 V, the larger strain in PPy-TFSi-doped
actuator may be due to the higher charge-transfer rate; this phenomenon
illustrates that electrical energy is converted into mechanical energy.
Therefore, the strain caused from actuator deformation is proportional
to the charge transfer at higher voltages. At a lower potential, however,
because of fewer number of ions transferred to the film, the tip displacement
is smaller.26,27 A typical current and charge-transfer
response under various input voltages is depicted in Figure 3d,e, respectively. It is found
that the charge transfer at a higher potential, that is 1.5 V is larger
than that at lower voltages. These results indicate that the level
to which PPy is oxidized or reduced is higher at a higher potential
and this leads to the larger displacement as compared to the case
of small potentials, that is 0.8 and 0.6 in the two-electrode configuration.
In the following electrochemical evaluation of a multilayer actuator,
±1.5 V potential is applied to determine the charge–discharge
current behavior at 50 mHz. Figure S4a represents
the input voltage, whereas Figure S4b is
the output current, which depicts a similar performance during oxidation
and reduction of the conducting polymer.

Simulation
The
bending effect in multilayer PPy actuators is caused by the
volume change in different layers that associate with the redox reaction.
Therefore, the thermal expansion analogy is relevant, in which a load
generated due to the volume change is similar to the volume change
in a trilayer PPy actuator because of ion migration.

The mathematical
modeling of multilayer actuators involves three
coupled physics phenomena: electric current conduction, heat conduction
with thermal generation, and structural stresses and strains due to
thermal expansion. This model can describe the change in the volume
due to thermal expansion. COMSOL Multiphysics software was used to
solve the mathematical model. The modeled structure consists of three
layers in which PVDF is sandwiched between two conducting PPy layer. Figure 4 represents the boundary
assumed in the equivalent model.28 The
fixed constraints are applied at the left end of the cantilever instead
of being clipped by an alligator clip. The voltage was applied from
the left to the right sides in order to accelerate the computation
time clip. The equivalent thermal expansion coefficient of PPy has
been evaluated using the experimental results, whereas the material
properties of PVDF and PPy have been set in accordance with the previous
work of PPy actuator modeling.5

Figure 4 Equivalent
model of PPy trilayer actuator.

For simulation of the trilayer actuator, the first layer
of the
thermal expansion coefficient of PPy is set as 0.03/°F, whereas
the second layer of PPy thermal expansion coefficient is −0.03/°F,
and other material parameters are shown in Table 1. The governing equation used in this study
is the heat transfer equation, in which some assumptions have been
considered to simplify the model. For instance, (i) the thickness
effect is ignored because the thickness is much smaller than the length,
(ii) there is no thermal resistance and creep (deformation) between
the layers, (iii) the materials parameter is constant, and (iv) coupling
of electrophysics and thermal physics is ignored. The heat transfer
equation can be written in the form23 1  where di is the material density, cpi is heat capacity at constant
pressure, Vi is the volume, h is the
surface combined heat transfer coefficient, S is
surface area, R is heater resistance, and U is the applied voltage. Both sides of the eq 1 describe the rate at which the
thermodynamic energy is changing, the first terms on both sides of
the equation describe the heat flux that flows into the actuator,
the second term shows the heat loss from the surface, and the last
term is Joule heat.

The boundary conditions are  and  

In the simulation, meshing and setting boundary conditions
are
finished according to the simulation need. The total number of elements
is 24267, adopting the free tetrahedral mesh. Three voltages were
applied from the fixed constraints (left side) to the tip of the cantilever.
The final deflection of the PPy actuator cantilever was obtained from
electrothermal–structural coupling simulation techniques as
shown in Figure 5. Figure 5a–c illustrates
the comparison between deformed and undeformed cantilevers at three
different voltages (1.5, 0.8, and 0.6 V). This theoretical modeling
agrees with experimental results and shows similar displacement behavior.
This modeling is also called the von-Mises stress distribution of
the cantilever; the maximum von-Mises stress is distributed on the
tip side of the cantilever, which is 25 MPa stress at 1.5 V. Figure 5d–f illustrates
the electric potential distribution across the model PPy trilayer
cantilever at 1.5, 0.8, and 0.6 V. These simulation results depict
that the deflection of the cantilever beam with low potential side
is less as compared to the tip in the thermal expansion method.

The simulated deformation of the
trilayer PPy actuator at three
different potentials, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.5 V is shown in Figure 6a. It is depicted that the
displacement tends to increase with the increasing voltage, the red
curve is the deformation at the voltage of 1.5 V, and the maximum
tip vertical displacement can reach 12.2 mm. Figure 6b shows the experimental deflection of the
actuator at three different voltages (1.5, 0.8, and 0.6 V), which
demonstrate deflection behavior similar to the numerical model. However,
in numerical modeling, the deflection is slightly more, and consistent
as compared to the experimental results. This is because of the environmental
effect (moisture and oxygen), which leads to the oxidation of the
electrolyte and reduces the ion kinetics during the redox reaction.29,30Figure 6c depicts
the simulated deformation of the PPy actuator as a function of voltage
in the range from 0 to 1.5 V. For comparison, experimental deflection
at three voltages (1.5, 0.8, and 0.6 V) in purple dots is shown. Figure 6d illustrates that
the simulated displacement of the trilayer actuator is linearly increasing
with the respective voltage, which acknowledges the behavior of the
conducting polymer actuator, where the charge transfer increases with
the increment of potential. The agreement between experiments and
simulation behavior of tip displacement validates the feasibility
of the equivalent model in the prediction of PPy actuator deformation
at various voltages.

Conclusions
In this study, the static response of a PPy
actuator cantilever
was characterized experimentally and compared with COMSOL Multiphysics
simulation. To explore the bending response of the PPy actuator cantilever,
a multilayer PPy actuator was fabricated by electrochemical synthesis
via the constant current method. The displacement, charge transfer,
and current behavior of the actuator were studied by applying three
different potentials. For simulation, thermal expansion analogy, which
is similar to the volume change of the multilayer PPy actuator due
to ion migration, has been considered to develop the model. The PPy
actuators exhibited a similar response in their bending by increasing
applied voltage in the simulations as well as the experimental investigations.
By comparing theoretical modeling with electrosynthesis of actuators,
it is confirmed that the equivalent model is viable for predicting
the conducting polymer actuator deformation at different input voltages.

°C according to the description at.

Metallization
Gold was deposited (CVC 601 sputter deposition)
on both sides of the PVDF film at 2 × 10–6 mTorr

current (chronopotentiometry) is passed between the working electrode
and the counter electrode using the Biological SP 200 potentiometer.
Au-deposited PVDF acted as the working electrode and the aluminum
mesh was the counter electrode in the solution, which contains 0.1
M pyrrole dissolved in 0.1 M LiTFSi/PC with 1% water. The polymerization
of the PVDF membrane was performed for 12 h at −16 °C
with 0.1 mA constant current.

Electromechanical and Simulation
Modeling
The electrochemical
displacement of the trilayer actuator was acquired by imaging of the
actuator with a graph paper placed parallel to the actuator. A high-resolution
video camera was used. The actuator input voltage signal was provided
by a Biological SP 200 potentiometer, which measures the output current
as well as charge transfer during the redox reaction. The simulation
of the actuator was performed using the COMSOL Multiphysics software.
