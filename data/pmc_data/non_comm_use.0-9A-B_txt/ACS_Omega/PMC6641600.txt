Lack
of control over the structure and electrically nonconductive
properties of coordination polymers (CPs) creates a major hindrance
to designing an active electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction
(ORR). Here, we report a new semiconductive and low-optical band gap
CP structure [{Co3(μ3-OH)(BTB)2(BPE)2}{Co0.5N(C5H5)}], 1, that exhibits high-performance ORR in alkaline medium.
The electrical conductivity of compound 1 was measured
using impedance spectroscopy and found to be 5 × 10–4 S cm–1. The Ketjenblack EC-600JD carbon used as
a support for all the electrochemical methods such as cyclic voltammetry,
rotating disk electrode, rotating ring-disk electrode and Koutecký–Levich analysis. The
as-synthesized Co-based catalyst has the ability to reduce O2 to H2O by a nearly four-electron process. The crystal
structure of 1 shows that the trimeric unit {Co3(μ3-OH)(COO)5N3} and monomeric
unit {Co(COO)2(NC5H4)2}2+ are linked with BTB and BPE linkers to form a three-dimensional
structure. Theoretical calculations predict that the monomeric center
acts as an active catalytic site for ORR. This could be due to the
efficient overlap of highest occupied molecular orbital–lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital between monomer and O2 molecule.
This CP, 1, shows facile 3.6-electron ORR, and it is
inexpensive compared with widely used Pt catalysts. Therefore, this
CP can be used as a promising cathode material for fuel cells in terms
of efficiency and cost effectiveness.

Introduction
Oxygen reduction reaction
(ORR) is a fundamental reaction related
to energy conversion.1 It gains much interest
in fuel cells or lithium–air batteries because of its essential
role in them.2 Optimization of an electrocatalyst
is necessary either to enhance the efficiency of the fuel cell or
to increase the kinetics rate of ORR.3 Pt-based
materials are most effective ORR catalysts, but there is a need to
replace them for cost effectiveness.3 It
is quite difficult to synthesize an ideal catalyst for ORR because
of several factors that will interfere with the desired architecture
and electronic properties. Among several desirable characteristics,
high active site density, stability in electrolyte/oxygen and peroxide,
reusability, and low overpotential relative to the thermodynamic of
4e– oxygen-to-water reduction potential of 1.23
eV are very impotent for effective ORR catalysts. It has been shown
that transition-metal-, nitrogen-, and carbon-containing compounds
having an M–Nx structural motif
can act as an effective ORR catalyst, where M is nonplatinum metal,
and in most of the cases, it is Fe or Co or Cu or Ni, which is chelated
with nitrogen atoms of the ligand.4−6 The structure with an
M–Nx motif exhibits good ORR activity
but suffers difficulty in terms of stability in various electrolytes.
Thermal treatment can get rid of this stability issue, but it introduced
new challenges to find out catalytic active sites, which are essential
for catalyst optimization and mechanistic understanding. Thus, there
is a demand for chemically and electrochemically stable ORR electrocatalysts
with well-defined catalytic sites.

A hierarchy of architectures,
tunable chemical structure, and high
surface area lead to tailor-made pores for controllable reactions
and maximize active sites. These characteristics make metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs) or coordination polymers (CPs) potential candidates
for electrocatalysis. However, most of the MOFs or CPs are electrical
insulators, which limit their use in electrocatalytic applications.7−9 Recent synthetic modifications have given rise to conductive MOFs,
and few of these exhibit electrocatalysis.10,11 Recently, Miner et al. have used a conductive MOF, Ni3(hexaiminotriphenylene)2, as an ORR catalyst.12 However, this conductive MOF reduces oxygen
to H2O2 (87.5%) by a 2e– process.
Jahan et al. reported 4e– transfer ORR pathways
using a composite of graphene–metalloporphyrin MOFs.13 Therefore, there is a high demand for synthesizing
conductive or semiconductive MOFs or CPs for electrochemical applications.

It is to be noted that MOFs or CPs have been used as ORR catalysts
either by making composites containing graphene oxide and porphyrin
or by making porous carbonaceous materials using high-temperature
pyrolysis.13−18 Here, our aim is to design and synthesize a nonplatinum metal-based
conductive MOF or CP by controlling the structure and chemical and
electronic properties for targeted ORR catalysts. We introduce [{Co3(μ3-OH)(BTB)2(BPE)2}{Co0.5N(C5H5)}], 1, a new three-dimensional CP structure with an optical band gap energy
of 1.83 eV, which facilitates ORR via a 3.6-electron reaction. This
CP retains its current density during ORR and shows no morphological
degradation due to electrochemical reactions. These characteristics
make it one of the promising nonplatinum-group metal ORR catalysts.

Results
and Discussion
Compound 1 was synthesized solvothermally
using CoCl2 (0.25 mmol), 1,3,5-tris(4-carboxyphenyl)benzene
(0.05 mmol)
(BTB), 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane (0.1 mmol) (BPE), and DMF–H2O solvent mixture on heating at 120 °C for 72 h (see
the Supporting Information). Purple-colored
needle-shaped crystals were characterized using single-crystal X-ray
diffraction, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA), IR, and so forth. They have a three-dimensional structure,
where {Co3(μ3-OH)(COO)5N3} and {Co(COO)2(NC5H4)2} units are linked with BTB anions (Figure 1a).

Figure 1 (a) Three-dimensional structure of compound 1 along
the ac plane. (b,c) Trimer and monomer units, respectively,
present in the compound.

The trimeric unit, {Co3(μ3-OH)
(COO)5N3}, is built from three different cobalt
centers,
where one is distorted tetrahedral Co(1)O4, another is
distorted trigonal bipyramid Co(2)O4N, and the third one
is distorted octahedral Co(3)O4N2 units (Figure 1b). The three CoII ions are linked through a bridge OH group, forming a scalene
triangle (with Co···Co distances in the range of 3.172–3.712
Å). In the monomer unit, {Co0.5(COO)2(NC6H5)}, the cobalt ion has a distorted octahedral
geometry with two carboxylate moieties and two pyridine molecules
(Figure 1c). The formation
of a pyridine molecule is in situ, and it could be formed from a BPE
molecule. The connectivity of the cobalt trimer and monomer with BPE
and BTB ligands forms the three-dimensional structure. Topological
analysis showed a structure topological network with 6, 12, 13, 14-c
net with stoichiometry (6-c)(12-c)2(13-c)2(14-c)2; 4-nodal net.19

PXRD data of the as-synthesized compound 1 match with
the simulated PXRD pattern, indicating the phase purity of the compound
(Figure S1a). Thermogravimetric data show
that compound 1 is stable up to 300 °C (Figure S2). The IR spectrum exhibits the characteristic
peaks of organic struts (Figure S3). The
optical band gap energy was calculated from the diffuse reflectance
spectra, and it was found to be 1.83 eV (Figure S4). N2 adsorption isotherm confirms the nonporous
nature of the compound (Figure S5). We
have measured the impedance for compound 1 (without conducting
carbon) by making a pellet with a 0.25 mm thickness and a 1.0 cm2 area. Impedance spectroscopy was performed at open-circuit
potentials with a frequency range of 100–1 kHz (Figure 2). The conductivity of the
compound 1 is 5 × 10–4 S cm–1, calculated using eq 1. The conductivity value of the compound 1 suggests that it is a semiconductor. 1  where σ stands for the conductivity, R stands for the resistance, l stands for
the thickness of the material, and a stands for the
area of the material.

The semiconductive nature and stability of compound 1 in KOH solution provoked us to explore its electrochemical
characteristics
(Figures S4 and S1b). The cyclic voltammogram of compound 1 (recorded with
20 mV s–1 at room temperature) on glassy carbon
rotating disk electrodes exhibits a featureless voltammetric current
in a N2 atmosphere. Under an O2 atmosphere,
it clearly exhibits a well-defined reduction peak current with an
onset potential of 0.81 V versus RHE in 0.10 M solution of KOH (Figure 3). This proved that
compound 1 can enhance the ORR activity of the glassy
carbon electrode.

Figure 3 Cyclic voltammogram of compound 1 in 0.1
M KOH electrolyte
saturated with O2 and N2 at room temperature.

To assess the suitability of compound 1 as an electrocatalyst
for cathode ORR, we have investigated the methanol tolerance ability
of the catalyst in oxygen-saturated 0.1 M KOH containing 1 M methanol
(Figure S6). The measurements show that
no influence was detected due to the presence of methanol. This confirms
the methanol tolerance of the catalyst, and we can conclude that compound 1 can be used as a cathode for the direct methanol fuel cell
(DMFC).

The kinetics studied through rotating disk voltammetry
provide
in-depth information toward the electron-transfer kinetics of compound 1 during ORR. The voltammetric profiles show that, with the
increase of rotation speed of the electrode, the current density is
enhanced (Figure S7). Koutecky–Levich
(K–L) plots measured at various potentials in the ORR regime
are nearly parallel to the theoretical four-electron line, indicating
the near complete reduction of oxygen into OH– ions.
Moreover, the linearity of the plots suggests the first-order reaction
kinetics for ORR (Figure 4).

Figure 4 K–L plots of compound 1 studied at different
electrode potentials.

Rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) analysis was performed
by coating
the disk portion of the RRDE with the compound 1. In
addition, the ring was posted at 0.45 V versus RHE to detect the intermediates
of ORR generated out of the disk (Figure S8). Using the following eqs 2 and 3, we have calculated the number
of electrons (n) and % of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) liberated during the ORR. If the O2 undergoes complete reduction into OH–, n would be 4 and hydrogen peroxide production would be 0%.
The intermediates generated at the disk, such as peroxide, can oxidize
at the ring as it is biased at 0.45 V versus RHE. From the obtained Idisk and Iring values
of the RDE experiment, n values were calculated and
it was in between 3.4 and 3.6 in the potential range of 0.85–0.40
V versus RHE (Figure 5), implying that ORR proceeds through nearly four-electron-transfer
pathway with compound 1. The H2O2 production rate was 20–30% in the ORR region. 2   3  where Iring, Idisk, and
C.E stand for the ring current, disk
current, and collection efficiency, respectively. The C.E value (0.19)
of the catalyst-coated RRDE was assessed using the reported procedure.20

We have performed steady-state chronoamperometry at E = 0.6 V in 0.1 M KOH solution saturated with oxygen. The
results
showed that around 80% of the initial current density was retained
over a period of 25 h (Figure S9). This
result suggests that the durability of the compound 1 as an ORR catalyst was superior compared to those of other MOF-based
ORR catalysts and Pt nanoparticles (42%), Ni foam (48%), and so forth.13,14

A better ORR catalyst always maintains its structural and
functional
stability during electrochemical reactions. For the present case,
we have carried out PXRD, microscopy techniques, IR spectroscopy,
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques, and inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to analyze the structural
integrity after ORR activity (Figures S1a and S10–S13). PXRD data of compound 1 before and after the ORR experiment show that compound 1 maintained its structural integrity after ORR (Figure S1a). We have done stereomicroscopy and
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies of the catalyst before
and after ORR reactions (Figures S10 and S11). The overall morphology was unchanged upon
electrochemical reactions under O2. The SEM images after
ORR appear to be rough, which might be the evidence of O2 adsorption on the surface of the catalyst (Figure S11). The structural integrity was evidenced by IR spectroscopy
carried out on the catalyst before and after electrochemical reactions
(Figure S12). XPS studies of the catalyst
before and after ORR revealed a slight shift in binding energy to
a higher energy of the Co 2p region (780–790 eV) (Figure S13). This shift in binding energy could
be due to the interactions of the cobalt center with oxygen molecules.
The ICP-MS result shows the negligible amount of cobalt in the electrolyte
during electrochemical reactions under O2 and hence rules
out any possible destruction of the framework under oxygen reduction
conditions (see the Supporting Information). All of these characterizations revealed that though the catalyst
undergoes minor structural rearrangement during the electrochemical
reaction under O2, it retains the catalytic activity because
the active sites were unaffected during electrocatalysis.

Computational
Methods
We have carried out density functional theory calculations
using
M062X21 functional to shed light on the
oxygen-binding propensity of the monomeric and the trimeric units.
For the ease of calculations, these units are modeled separately,
keeping the same local environment around the Co centers; Co(PhCO2)2Py2 is chosen as a model for the monomeric
unit, whereas the trimeric unit is modeled with Co3(PhCO2)5(OH)Py3. Optimized structures of these
units are given in the Supporting Information, and the computed structural parameters are consistent with the
experimental data (Figure S14). The Kohn–Sham
orbital analysis shows that lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs)
in these model units are delocalized over the Co–Py fragments
(Figure S15). The LUMO of the monomeric
unit arises from the overlap between two π* type antibonding
orbitals of the Py ligands and a suitably oriented Co d-orbital. Such
an overlap is favored by the linear disposition of the Py–Co–Py
fragment (a N–Co–N bond angle 180°) in the monomer.
The LUMO of the trimeric unit involves the Co(3) site which is attached
to two Py ligands (CoO4N2 environment). However,
in contrary to the monomer, the LUMO is delocalized over only one
Co–Py fragment because of the nonlinearity of the N–Co–N
fragment (a N–Co–N bond angle 96.1°). An inspection
of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the oxygen molecule
clearly indicates that O2 coordination would occur in the
monomeric unit owing to the favorable symmetric combination between
the frontier orbitals (Figures 6 and S16). Such interactions are
not viable at the Co(3) site of the trimer. In addition, in line with
this observation, we have successfully located a complex of a monomer
with O2 coordinating at the Co site (side-on manner).22 Complete ORR mechanism on this compound is being
investigated in detail.

Figure 6 HOMO and LUMO positions of the monomer and schematic
of interactions
between monomer and O2 molecule.

The mechanism and precise active sites of the M–N–C
(Fe–N–C or Co–N–C) catalysts for ORR are
still not very clear, which hinders the development and commercialization
of these catalysts.16 Recently, it was
shown that unpyrolyzed MOFs can be used for ORR. The drawbacks of
the unpyrolyzed MOFs are the low onset potential and incomplete reduction
of oxygen, with less than 4e– per oxygen molecule
in 0.1 N KOH electrolyte. Mao et al. studied the (Cu-bipy-BTC) (bipy
= 2,2′-bipyridine and BTC = 1,3,5-benzene tricarboxylic acid)
MOF in a phosphate buffer electrolyte (pH = 6).7 It shows oxygen reduction via a 4e– pathway
at 0.6 V versus RHE in a pH = 6 electrolyte. Miner et al. showed that
Ni3(hexaiminotriphenylene)2 reduces oxygen via
a 2e– pathway in 0.1 N KOH.12 Several Co- and Fe-based MOFs were used as templates in synthesizing
electrocatalysts via pyrolysis method.23−27 Although the catalysts synthesized from the pyrolysis
method show higher ORR onset, the active sites involved in these pyrolyzed
catalysts are not clearly known, thereby limiting the researchers’
ability to engineer the catalysts to improve ORR. To design efficient
ORR catalysts with precise information about the active sites, unpyrolyzed
catalysts might be the better choice. Among the unpyrolyzed catalysts,
the present compound 1 exhibits better ORR activity,
which is comparable to other reported ORR activities (Table S3).

Conclusions
In
summary, we have synthesized a new semiconductive three-dimensional
cobalt-based CP, where trimeric and monomeric units are linked with
the organic ligands to form the structural architecture. The electrical
conductivity of compound 1 is 5 × 10–4 S cm–1, and an optical band gap energy of 1.83
eV confirms its semiconductor nature. Interestingly, this compound
shows oxygen reduction in alkali medium with a 3.6-electron-transfer
process, leading to a near complete reduction of O2 into
OH– ions. Methanol tolerance experiments revealed
that this catalyst can act as a cathode material in DMFCs. Chronoamperometry
studies showed that it can retain its current density up to 80% over
a period of 25 h. This performance is much superior to those of any
other reported MOFs or MOF–graphene composites in terms of
durability. All state-of-the-art characterizations revealed that the
present catalyst maintains its structural robustness during electrocatalysis.
We have carried out theoretical calculations to understand the active
catalytic center in the present catalyst, and they showed that O2 molecules can effectively bind with the monomeric cobalt
center. In addition, this is due to the efficient overlap of HOMO–LUMO
between monomer and O2 molecule. With this knowledge of
the active catalytic site, presently we are working on synthesizing
conducting inorganic–organic hybrid materials and unravel the
mechanistic pathway for this electrocatalysis reaction.

a complex with the coordination of O2 at the site Co(3)
of trimer led to separated species such as O2 and trimer.
This can as well be due to the steric congestion at the Co(3) site
preventing the coordination of O2.
