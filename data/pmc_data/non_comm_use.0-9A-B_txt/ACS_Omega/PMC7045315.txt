Successful surgeries
involving orthopedic implants depend on the
avoidance of biofilm development on the implant surface during the
early postoperative period. Here, we investigate the potential of
novel antibacterial compounds—second-generation lipophosphonoxins
(LPPOs II)—as additives to surgical bone cements. We demonstrate
(i) excellent thermostability of LPPOs II, which is essential to withstand
elevated temperatures during exothermic cement polymerization; (ii)
unchanged tensile strength and elongation at the break properties
of the composite cements containing LPPOs II compared to cements without
additives; (iii) convenient elution kinetics on the order of days;
and (iv) the strong antibiofilm activity of the LPPO II-loaded cements
even against bacteria resistant to the medicinally utilized antibiotic,
gentamicin. Thus, LPPOs II display promising potential as antimicrobial
additives to surgical bone cements.

Introduction
Infections are feared
complications of all indwelling orthopedic
implants. These infections may result in the development of biofilms
on the implant surface.1 The main causative
agents are staphylococci followed by streptococci.2 A number of strategies have been developed to prevent these
infections.3,4 A frequently used strategy is the usage
of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as a local carrier of antibiotics
(ATB). ATB is released from the PMMA surface for several hours/days,
targeting bacteria on its surface and in the near vicinity without
potential systemic side effects.5 Gentamicin
is the most commonly used antibiotic for these purposes. However,
resistance to clinically used antibiotics, including gentamicin, is
on the rise and poses a serious problem.6,7 Therefore,
new compounds with improved antibacterial/antibiofilm characteristics
and a low propensity for the development of resistant strains are
highly desirable.

Several years ago, we reported the design
and synthesis of new
antibacterial compounds termed lipophosphonoxins (LPPOs). LPPOs are
small amphiphilic molecules bearing positive charge(s). Their general
structure (Figure 1) consists of four modules: (i) a nucleoside module, (ii) an iminosugar
module, (iii) a hydrophobic module (lipophilic alkyl chain), and (iv)
a phosphonate linker module that holds together modules (i)–(iii).
First-generation LPPOs (LPPOs I) demonstrated excellent bactericidal
activity against various Gram-positive species, including multiresistant
strains such as vancomycin-resistant enterococci or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The minimum inhibitory concentration
(MIC) values were in the 1–12 mg/L range, while their cytotoxic
concentrations against human cell lines were above this range (IC50 60–100 mg/L).8,9

Figure 1 Lipophosphonoxins. The
scheme in the left depicts the general structure
of LPPOs. Examples of LPPOs I and II are shown in the middle and in
the right. Compounds DR-6155 and DR-6180 were used in this study.

However, LPPO I compounds are ineffective against Gram-negative
bacteria. By redesigning the iminosugar module, so that it bore more
positive charges, we developed the second generation of LPPOs (LPPOs
II) with increased efficacy (MIC < 1–6 mg/L) against Gram-positive
species and an extended antibacterial activity range that now also
includes serious Gram-negative pathogens, such as clinically relevant
strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella enteritidis.10 We have shown that at
their bactericidal concentrations, LPPOs II act upon the cytoplasmic
membrane of bacteria but not of eukaryotes. In vivo, LPPOs II do not
inhibit synthesis of any of the cell macromolecules (DNA, RNA, protein,
peptidoglycan, and membrane lipids). The only target of LPPOs II is
the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane to which these compounds cause
serious damage, resulting in efflux of the bacterial cytosol and cell
disintegration. Employing model membranes (liposomes and black lipid
membranes), we demonstrated that LPPOs II act by creating pores (with
a conductance of up to 500 pS) in the membrane.10 Further, LPPOs II are well tolerated by live mice when
administered orally (2000 mg/kg)10 and
cause no skin irritation in rabbits (unpublished results). The general
structure of LPPOs, an example of LPPOs I (compound DR-5026), and examples of LPPOs II (DR-6155 and DR-6180) (the bold numbers used throughout the text refer to LPPO structures)
are depicted in Figure 1.

Finally and importantly, using several of the most potent
LPPOs
I and LPPOs II, we failed to select Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, or Streptococcus agalactiae strains resistant against DR-5026 and P. aeruginosa resistant
to DR-6155, while resistant strains against known conventional
antibiotics (rifampicin and ciprofloxacin, respectively) were readily
developed or induced in control.8−10

In this proof-of-concept
study, we evaluate selected LPPOs DR-6155 and DR-6180 as additives in PMMA bone
cements, demonstrating their ability (i) to mix well with PMMA, (ii)
to be unaffected by the increased temperature during PMMA polymerization,
(iii) to minimally affect the tensile strength and elongation at the
break properties of the composite material compared to only cement,
(iv) to be continuously eluted from the bone cement for extended periods
of time, and (v) to efficiently prevent biofilm formation upon elution.

Results
and Discussion
Selection of LPPOs
We selected two
LPPOs (DR-6155 and DR-6180) for subsequent
studies as these compounds
were the most effective ones against a range of Gram-positive and
Gram-negative bacteria, including dangerous resistant pathogens (see Table 1 for MIC values) while
displaying low cytotoxicity.10

Thermostability
of LPPOs
PMMA bone cements increase
their temperature up to 90 °C during the exothermic radical polymerization
in dependence of the particular type of PMMA.11 Therefore, as an essential prerequisite, we first evaluated the
ability of DR-6155 and DR-6180 to withstand
increased temperatures during Bone cement R polymerization (78 °C
according to the manufacturer). Therefore, we incubated two concentrations
of each DR-6155 and DR-6180 dissolved in
water (for details see the Experimental Section) at 80 °C for 4 and 8 h, respectively. The incubation times
vastly surpass those required for Bone cement R polymerization (polymerization
time ca. 10 min), but we wished to allow a generous margin to also
evaluate the long-term thermostability of the tested compounds. Subsequently,
we evaluated the integrity of the compounds by means of liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (LC–MS). The LC–MS analysis revealed no
degradation products even after the 8 h-long incubation, demonstrating
excellent thermostability of the tested compounds (Figure S1).

Preparation of PMMA Bone Cement Loaded with
LPPOs
In
the next step, we designed and constructed apparatus for formation
of PMMA bone cement pellets of uniform size (see the Experimental Section for details). LPPOs DR-6155 and DR-6180 mixed well with the cement and did not
interfere with the polymerization process (see the next section).
Importantly, the apparatus allowed creating pellets with identical
weight and compaction.

Tensile Strength and Elongation at Break
of Composite Cements
Tensile strength and elongation at break
of composite cements containing DR-6180 were tested according
to ISO 527 (for details see
the Experimental Section). The results revealed
no significant differences in both parameters (Figure 2) between composite cements containing up
to 0.2 g of LPPO/10 g of cement and only cement, indicating that LPPOs
did not negatively affect the polymerization process.

Figure 2 Tensile strength and
elongation at break of composite cements.
(A) Tensile strength and (B) Elongation at break of composite cements
containing increasing amounts of DR-6180. P5-P9 are DR-6180: bone cement R ratio as defined in Table 1. The increasing amount of DR-6180 is indicated below the graphs. P10 (gray bars) is
only bone cement R. The bars are averages from four independent experiments;
the error bars represent ±SD.

Elution Kinetics of LPPOs from PMMA Bone Cement
Figure 3A shows two approaches
that were used to determine the elution kinetics. The first approach
consisted of withdrawing aliquots from the medium where the pellets
were kept throughout the duration of the experiment; in the second
approach, the pellets were transferred after indicated time points
into fresh medium to mimic the exchange of the liquids surrounding
the bone cement. For subsequent pilot experiments, we selected several
ratios of the amount of LPPO (DR-6155 and DR-6180) per 10 g of PMMA (from 0.05 g of LPPO per 10 g of the PMMA bone
cement to 0.2 g of LPPO per 10 g) to determine which ratio resulted
in optimal, above MIC values of the eluted LPPO (Figure 3B). Interestingly, the elution
was not linear with respect to the LPPO load in the bone cement. Then,
0.18 g of LPPO per 10 g of the PMMA bone cement was selected as the
best combination. Importantly, this LPPO amount was still relatively
small and should not compromise the mechanical properties of the bone
cement, as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 3 Elution kinetics of LPPOs DR-6155 and DR-6180 from bone cement pellets. (A) A scheme of the two types of elution
strategies. Upper panel: the pellet (yellow) was incubated in the
same solution, and aliquots of the medium were withdrawn at time points
for LC–MS; bottom panel: the pellet was transferred at time
points into fresh solution. The solution from which the pellet had
been transferred was used for LC–MS. The arrows indicate the
flow of the experiments. (B) Elution of DR-6155 from
bone cement after 480 min in physiological solution at 37 °C
by the approach depicted in the upper panel of (A). The LPPO was mixed
with the bone cement at indicated ratios. (C, D) The pellets with
the tested LPPO (0.18 g of LPPO/10 g of cement) were immersed in physiological
solution at 37 °C, and at time intervals, aliquots were withdrawn
for LC–MS analysis, as depicted in the upper panel of (A).
(E, F) The pellets with the tested LPPO (0.18 g of LPPO/10 g of cement)
were immersed in physiological solution at 37 °C, and at time
intervals, aliquots were withdrawn for LC–MS analysis. After
each withdrawal, the pellets were transferred into fresh solution,
as depicted in the lower panel of (A). (G) As in (E, F) but the elution
time was prolonged and 0.18 g of LPPO/10 g of cement was used. The
experiments were conducted in duplicate, the bars/dots show the averages,
and the error bars show the range.

Then, we monitored the elution kinetics and its efficiency in more
detail for DR-6155 and DR-6180. We analyzed
the amount of eluted DR-6155 and DR-6180 by LC–MS. Figure 3C,D shows the elution kinetics of DR-6155 and DR-6180 over 8 h without pellet transfer into a fresh solution.
The graph shows that DR-6155 and DR-6180 were eluted till the end of the experiment, with a rapid initial
spike and a more gradual tail. Next, we performed experiments with
pellet transfer. In the first round of these experiments that were
limited to 24 h, DR-6155 and DR-6180 were
continuously eluted over the monitored time period (Figure 3E,F). As with the first type
of experiment, we noticed that the kinetics appeared to be biphasic:
a strong initial spike followed by more gradual elution. Next, we
extended the time period till 8 days (with pellet transfer; performed
only for DR-6180; Figure 3G) and observed a similar type of kinetics but the
compound was continuously eluted even over the prolonged time period.
We also noticed that DR-6155 was consistently being eluted
more efficiently than DR-6180. It could be explained
by the higher polarity and aqueous solubility of compound DR-6155.

Antibiofilm Activity of LPPO-Loaded Cements
Finally,
we tested the ability of LPPOs DR-6155 and DR-6180 to prevent biofilm formation on PMMA bone cements. We used LPPOs DR-6155 and DR-6180 in a range of concentrations
(from 0.05 to 0.2 g of LPPO DR-6155 or DR-6180 in 10 g of PMMA Bone cement R). As a control, we used pellets with
gentamicin (Palacos R+G). This particular bone cement contains 0.9
g of gentamicin sulfate per 40 g of PMMA bone cement (LPPOs were in
the form of hydrochlorides). We used standard reference bacterial
strains (E. faecalis CCM 4224, S. aureus CCM 4223, E. coli CCM 3954, and P. aeruginosa 3955)
from the Czech Collection of Microorganisms (CCM), Faculty of Science,
Masaryk University, Brno. Furthermore, the reference bacterial strain S. epidermidis CCM 7221 bearing the ica operon (polysaccharide intercellular adhesion12), which is frequently used as a standard for biofilm production,
was included in the study.

The PMMA loaded with DR-6155 at 0.2 g/10 g of cement showed complete inhibitory effects against
biofilm formation for all tested bacterial strains, i.e., S. epidermidis, S. aureus, E. faecalis, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa (Figure 4). In the case of DR-6180 also the biofilm formation was completely inhibited with tested
bacterial strains at the same concentration, with the exception of P. aeruginosa. Lower LPPO concentrations displayed
altered antibacterial efficiencies that were specific for each LPPO.
Controls without antibiotics showed, as expected, no biofilm formation
inhibition, whereas the gentamicin-containing commercial bone cement
functioned on all tested bacterial strains with the exception of gentamicin-resistant S. epidermidis.

Figure 4 Biofilm formation in the presence of pellets
from bone cement loaded
with the selected LPPO II. The biofilm formation was evaluated as
bacterial counts of bacteria (CFU/mL) released from the pellets by
gentle sonication and subsequently grown on Mueller–Hinton
Agar plates. The graph shows the experiment performed in duplicate.
The pellets were either without any additive (P10) or with LPPO DR-6155 or DR-6180 or gentamicin. The exact ratios
of added substances to the bone cement were as follows: P1—DR-6155 concentration 0.05 g/10 g PMMA, P2—DR-6155 concentration 0.15 g/10 g PMMA, P3—DR-6155 concentration
0.18 g/10 g PMMA, P4—DR-6155 concentration 0.2
g/10 g PMMA, P5—DR-6180 concentration 0.05 g/10
g PMMA, P6—DR-6180 concentration 0.15 g/10 g PMMA,
P7—DR-6180 concentration 0.18 g/10 g PMMA, P8—DR-6180 concentration 0.2 g/10 g PMMA, P9 (Gent.)—gentamicin
sulfate concentration 0.225 g/10 g PMMA, and P10—PMMA.

Conclusions
Biofilm formation is
a serious problem in prosthetic joint infections,13 and various strategies for “anti-infective”
implants were tested in the past.1,3,4,14 An urgent need exists
for compounds to be used as additives to PMMA with low probability
for resistance development.15,16 In this in vitro study,
we characterized two new compounds, DR-6155 and DR-6180, for their potential as novel bone cement additives
and compared these two compounds with gentamicin. Gentamicin primarily
binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit and causes misincorporation of
amino acids, causing protein aggregation and cell death.17 However, resistance to gentamicin arises easily,
mostly through its modification (acetylation, phosphorylation, and
adenylylation of hydroxy groups) in the bacterial cell and by efflux
mechanisms.18

First, we showed that
LPPOs DR-6155 and DR-6180 are highly thermostable,
which is necessary for maintenance of their
antibacterial activity after the exothermic phase of the PMMA polymerization
process.19 Second, various amounts of DR-6180 were mixed with the bone cement and tested for tensile
strength and elongation at break properties. The results of both tests
revealed virtually no adverse effect of the presence of DR-6180 in the cement. Further, various concentrations of DR-6155 and DR-6180 were subjected to in vitro testing of their
elution period and antibacterial efficacy. We found that their elution
kinetics resembled the elution of known antibiotics.20 An initial spike was observed within a few hours after
the application, followed by a more gradual prolonged elution on the
order of days. This aligns well with the potential therapeutic use,
where the elevated initial concentration kills existing bacteria,
and this is followed by the elution of decreased, but still sufficient,
amounts of the compounds providing the antibacterial milieu for an
extended period of time.21 We speculate
that the initial burst is the result of the contact between the fluid
and the surface of PMMA pellets. Similar to ATB-laden PMMA, this could
be followed by a release of DR-6155 and DR-6180 from deeper layers of the cement caused by elution via tiny pores
on the cement surface. We could expect increased porosity of our PMMA
pellets compared to vacuum-mixed PMMA.

Previously, DR-6155 and DR-6180 were
tested for their antimicrobial properties against planktonic cells.10 Here, we demonstrated their efficacy against
biofilm formation by the most frequent pathogens associated with prosthetic
joint infections, coagulase-negative Staphylococci and S. aureus. Importantly, DR-6155 and DR-6180, unlike gentamicin (Figure 4), were also effective against gentamicin-resistant S. epidermidis, an aggressive biofilm former and
causative agent of various infections, including those related to
implanted medical devices.22,23

Finally and importantly,
the aggressive mode of action of LPPOs DR-6155 and DR-6180 against the bacterial membrane
(fast membrane permeabilization and cell lysis) and the apparent lack
of resistant strains10 compares well with
other antibiotics, such as the clinically used gentamicin or even
the newly discovered optimized arylomycins.24 Based on these observations and results presented in this communication,
we conclude that the tested second-generation LPPOs display excellent
potential as antibacterial additives to bone cement to prevent bacterial
prosthetic joint infections and biofilm formation. Studies on animal
models evaluating LPPOs are currently in progress and will be reported
in due time.

Experimental Section
Synthesis of Lipophosphonoxins
LPPOs DR-6155 and DR-6180 were synthesized
according to a literature
procedure.10

Thermostability of LPPOs
For determination of the stability
of compounds DR-6155 and DR-6180 at evaluated
temperatures, the following setup was used: analytes were dissolved
in water at concentrations 1 mg/mL and 20 μg/mL and were shaken
at 80 °C for 8 h; during this time, the compound stability was
checked using the same high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
method as that used for the analysis of elution kinetics (vide supra, LC–MS Analysis of Elution Kinetics).

Preparation of LPPO-Loaded Bone Cement Pellets
First,
a device for producing uniformly sized bone cement pellets was designed
and built by the IOCB Development Center. Since there is no standard
for pellet size, we selected the one shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Device for producing uniformly sized bone cement
pellets ((A) poly(tetrafluoroethylene)
(PTFE) plate; (B) round holes in the shape of the resulting pellets;
(C) pins; (D) metal spacers; (E) screws and nuts).

The mold consists of a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) plate
(A)
with round holes (B) in the shape of the pellets. The PTFE material
has an advantage of low adhesion, leading to easy separation of the
product (pellets). There are pins (C) that go through the plate to
the bottoms of all holes. The pins are strongly held in the second
plate. Next, there are spacers (D) between both plates. The whole
assembly is held together by screws and nuts (E). When the spacers
(D) are removed, a space is formed between the plates. If the screws
become tightened, both plates go closer and the pins (C) go through
the plate pushing out the pellets. PTFE main plate (A) and bottom
plate were milled using a CNC machine. Ballmill cutter was used to
achieve a proper shape and smooth surface of sample holes. Spacers
(D) were cut by an Nd/YAG laser from a stainless steel sheet. Pins
(C) were standard commercial stainless steel nonhardened pins. Special
screws (E) were milled using a CNC machine from aluminum alloy 6061.

Second, the PMMA powder (Bone cement R; Zimmer Biomet) was mixed
with LPPOs (in the form of Tris-hydrochloride) with pharmaceutical
accuracy at the Hospital Pharmacy. The ratios of LPPOs DR-6155 and DR-6180 to the PMMA powder are shown in Table 2. Then, the mixture
of PMMA polymer and LPPO was mixed with the liquid monomer manually
in the aseptic operating room of the Department of Orthopedics under
standard surgical conditions. LPPO-loaded PMMA was then applied into
the above-described device to produce pellets. Pellets made of Palacos
R+G (0.9 g of gentamicin sulfate (0.5 g gentamicin base) per 40 g
PMMA; Heraeus Medical GmbH) were produced similarly.

Elution Kinetics
Experiment
A
The pellet was incubated in 10 mL of physiological
solution in a 50 mL Falcon tube in a shaker at 37 °C. At appropriate
time points (0, 60, 120, 240, and 480 min), 50 μL of solution
was taken and directly analyzed by LC–MS.

Experiment
B
The pellet was incubated in 1 mL of physiological
solution in a 2 mL Eppendorf tube in a shaker at 37 °C. At appropriate
time points (1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h or 1, 2, 4, and 8 days), the pellet
was transferred to a 2 mL Eppendorf tube with 1 mL of fresh physiological
solution and the original solution was analyzed.

LC–MS
Analysis of Elution Kinetics
All experiments
were analyzed on a ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC;
Acquity, H-class; Waters) instrument with both mass spectrometric
(Xevo qTOF; Waters) and photodiode array (Waters) detectors using
a C18 column (Acquity UPLC BEH, 2.1 × 50 mm2, 1.7
μm; Waters). Injection volume was 2 μL and gradient conditions
were as follows: 0–0.5 min 20% B, increased to 95% B in the
4th min, held till the 5th min, equilibrated for 2 min, where mobile
phase A was 0.05% formic acid and B was 0.05% formic acid in acetonitrile.
Mass detection was realized by positive electrospray ionization in
scan mode from 300 to 900 m/z; during
the first 0.3 min, the eluent was disposed to the waste.

Quantification
was done by external standard calibration based on a UV signal at
260 nm. Eluted products were identified by retention times and confirmed
with mass spectra.

In the case of repetitive solution withdrawal
(Experiment A), the total volume of the
physiological solution
was 10 mL. At each time point, 50 μL of solution was taken and
directly analyzed. In the case where pellets were transferred at each
time point in the fresh solution (Experiment
B), the volume of the physiological solution was 1 mL. This
solution was evaporated to dryness and dissolved in 50 μL of
HPLC grade water.

Testing Antibiofilm Activity of LPPO-Loaded
Cements
To test the inhibition of biofilm formation on the
surface of bone
cement with added LPPOs (DR-6155 and DR-6180) in a range of concentrations from 0.05 to 0.2 g of tested LPPO/10
g of cement, standard reference bacterial strains (E. faecalis CCM 4224, S. aureus CCM 4223, E. coli CCM 3954, and P. aeruginosa CCM 3955) from the Czech Collection
of Microorganisms (CCM), Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Brno,
were used. Furthermore, the reference bacterial strain, S. epidermidis CCM 7221, with positive biofilm formation
and the ica operon was included in the study.

Bone cement R without an antibiotic or LPPO and bone cement with
gentamicin (Palacos R+G) served as negative and positive controls.
The proper numbers of pellets (two pieces of each type per each tested
bacterium) were placed into culture plate wells (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Subsequently, 2 mL of a culture medium (BHI—Brain Heart Infusion;
Hi-Media) with the tested bacterial strains was added into the culture
plate wells. The culture plates were placed on a shaker (BIOSAN) in
a thermostat and cultured at 35 °C for 24 h.

After culturing,
cement beads were washed in 1 mL of distilled
water and placed into microcentrifuge tubes with 1 mL of culture medium
(BHI). Then, the tubes were vortexed, sonicated in a water bath for
2 min (Sonorex RK156, Fischer Scientific) to release the formed biofilm,
and vortexed again. The tube contents with sonicated cement beads
were diluted and inoculated onto Mueller–Hinton agar (TRIOS)
and cultured at 35 °C for 24 h. Subsequently, bacterial count
was semiquantitatively estimated. The limit of detection was 100 cfu/mL.

Fabrication of Dumbbell Specimens
First, a device for
producing uniformly sized bone cement Dumbbell specimens (Figure 6) was designed and
built by the IOCB Development Center. Both PTFE main plates (A; the
top and the bottom) were milled using a CNC machine. Spacer (B) was
cut with an Nd/YAG laser from a stainless steel sheet.

Figure 6 Device for producing
uniformly sized bone cement Dumbbell specimens:
top PTFE main plate (A1), bottom PTFE main plate (A2), and stainless
steel spacer (B).

Second, the PMMA powder
(Bone cement R; Zimmer Biomet) was mixed
with LPPOs (in the form of Tris-hydrochloride) with pharmaceutical
accuracy at the Hospital Pharmacy. The ratios of LPPOs DR-6155 and DR-6180 to the PMMA powder are shown in Table 2. Then, the mixture
of PMMA polymer and LPPO was mixed with the liquid monomer manually
in the aseptic operating room of the Department of Orthopedics under
standard surgical conditions. LPPO-loaded PMMA was then applied into
the above-described device to produce Dumbbell specimens. The dimensions
of the specimens were as follows: width 2 mm, nominal thickness 2
mm, and length of the specimen between grips 10 mm.

Tensile Tests
Tensile tests of the prepared materials
were performed on an Instron 3365 according to ISO 527.25 Tensile strength and elongation were evaluated.
Pneumatic grips with a speed of tearing of 1 mm/min were used. Elongation
was evaluated from the crosspiece movement.
