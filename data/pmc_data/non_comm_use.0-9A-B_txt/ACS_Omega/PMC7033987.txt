How to effectively regulate the electromagnetic
parameters of magnetic
composites to achieve better microwave absorption (MA) performances
is still a serious challenge. Herein, we constructed nanocomposites
composed of magnetic constituents and carbon materials to obtain high-efficiency
electromagnetic wave absorbers. Self-assembled, multi-interfacial,
and porous RGO/MWCNT/Fe3O4 hybrids (GMFs) were
synthesized via in situ one-pot solvothermal method. The growth mechanism
of the GMFs would be that the defects on reduced graphene oxide (RGO)
provide sites for the crystallization of Fe3O4. Also, the RGO and Fe3O4 were further linked
by the cross-connection of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs),
which acted as a bridge. The MA mechanism of GMFs was studied while
considering the synergistic effects between the three components (RGO,
MWCNT, and raspberry-shaped Fe3O4) and their
multi-interfacial and porous structure. Also, the MA performance of
the GMFs was conducted. The GMFs exhibited a maximum reflection loss
(RL) value of −61.29 dB at 10.48 GHz with a thickness of 2.6
mm when the contents of RGO and MWCNT were 6.3 and 1.3 wt %, respectively.
The RL values (≤−10 dB) were observed to be in the range
of 8.96–12.32 GHz, and the effective microwave absorption bandwidth
was tunable from 3.52 to 18 GHz by changing the sample thickness.
The results revealed that the multi-interfacial and porous structure
of the GMFs is beneficial to MA performance by inducing multiscatterings.
Since no toxic solvents were used, this method is environmentally
friendly and has potential for large-scale production. The prepared
GMFs may have a wide range of applications in MA materials against
electromagnetic interference pollution.

1 Introduction
With
the rapid development and application of electromagnetic wave
technology, many electronic devices running on electromagnetic wave
offer countless conveniences in communication. However, the electromagnetic
interference pollution comes soon afterward, which is harmful to the
equipment operation and biological processes, including human health.1−4 To solve this problem, excellent microwave absorption (MA) materials
are in demand in both military and civilian fields.5,6

Carbon-based materials, including graphene, carbon nanotube (CNT),
carbon black, and carbon fiber, show absorption performance with lightweight,
high specific surface area, and tunable properties of permittivity,
electrical, and thermal conductivity.7−9 In addition, the carbon-based
materials show many other applications, such as membrane materials,10 cathodes,11 supercapacitors,12 carbon-reinforced polymer composites,13 uranium adsorption materials,14,15 anticorrosion materials,16 dye-sensitized
solar cells,17 lithium-ion batteries,18 biosensors,19 thermal
conductive materials,20 antiwear materials,21 and ceramic nanocomposites.22 Nevertheless, carbon materials are unilateral dielectric
materials with high permittivity value and possess no magnetism, resulting
in impedance mismatch,23 which limits the
improvement of the MA performance.

Magnetic particles, such
as magnetic element, alloy (Fe, Co, Ni,
and FeCo),9 and their oxides (Fe3O4,24 γ-Fe2O3,25 Co@CoO,26 Co3O4,27 NiO,28 and CoFe2O429), have been reported in the field of
MA materials owing to their dielectric loss and magnetic loss properties.30−32 Except for the influences of the microstructures of electromagnetic
wave absorbers, the balance between the complex permeability and complex
permittivity (so-called impedance matching) plays a crucial role in
the absorption performance.33 It is difficult
for conventional microwave-absorbing materials to meet the requirements
of lightweight, high stability, and strong absorption for high-efficiency
microwave absorbers.9 Thus, the condition
of high density of pure magnetic particles is not satisfied by the
design of lightweight MA materials.

Recently, constructing nanocomposites
composed of magnetic constituents
and carbon materials has been regarded as an effective approach to
obtain high-efficiency electromagnetic wave absorbers.33 For instance, Co/C,33 Fe3O4/graphene,34 Fe3O4/CNTs,35 NiFe2O4/RGO,36 Ni/C,37 Ni/NiO-C,38 and MWCNT/NiO-Fe3O439 have shown excellent
MA performance. The dielectric loss, magnetic loss, and impedance-matching
properties are tunable by complex methods, the mass ratio of different
substances, and the size of nanoparticles.40−42

In this
study, we developed a facile solvothermal route for the
one-step synthesis of RGO/MWCNT/Fe3O4 hybrids
(GMFs) via an in situ self-assembly growth. The influences of the
RGO content and the reaction time of the solvothermal process on the
microwave absorption performance of the GMFs were studied. Structures
and morphologies of the GMFs were characterized. The MA mechanisms
were studied while considering of the synergistic effects between
the three components and their structural characteristics in detail.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structure and Morphology
of GMFs
The phase structure of the samples was determined
by X-ray diffraction
(XRD). Figure 1 depicts
the XRD patterns of the RGO, MWCNT, Fe3O4, and
GMFs. The diffraction peaks for both Fe3O4 and
GMFs appeared at about 18.3, 30.1, 35.4, 37.1, 43.1, 53.4, 56.9, 62.5,
and 73.9°, which corresponded to the (111), (220), (311), (222),
(400), (422), (511), (440), and (533) lattice planes of the face-centered
cubic (fcc) spinel phase of Fe3O4 (Powder Diffraction
File (PDF) No. 19-0629), respectively. The RGO showed a very broad
diffraction peak at 24.0°. The MWCNT showed peaks at 25.8 and
43.0°. The peaks of Fe3O4 can be observed
in the XRD pattern of GMF5. However, the characteristic peaks of pure
RGO and MWCNT at 24.0 and 25.8° cannot be seen, which may be
due to the low contents of RGO and MWCNT in GMF5. XRD patterns of
GMFs with different amounts of RGO (GMF0, GMF1, GMF3, GMF5, GMF7,
and GMF15) and different reaction times of GMF5-8h are also displayed
in the Supporting Information (Figure S1). All their peaks were completely consistent with each other.

Figure 1 XRD patterns
of pure RGO, MWCNT, Fe3O4, and
GMF5.

The morphologies of the samples
were examined by field emission
scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM). The size of pure Fe3O4 was about 300–700
nm according to the FESEM images (Figure 2a). Also, pure Fe3O4 were self-assembled cluster crystals. Pure RGO sheets were prepared
by the same hydrothermal thermal condition of GMF5 as a control experiment.
As for the GMF5, Fe3O4 were composed of the
RGO sheets and MWCNT uniformly. The size of Fe3O4 was about 200–450 nm, which is smaller than that of pure
Fe3O4 according to Figure 2c, which may be because the RGO and MWCNT
affected the progress of growth (from about 450 to 700 nm) of Fe3O4. The RGO sheets in GMF5 were thinner than the
pure RGO sheets, which may be due to the presence of Fe3O4 and MWCNT, which restrained the agglomeration of RGO.
Also, the formation of nanohybrids of GMF5 would restrict the growth
of Fe3O4 when the sizes of Fe3O4 was about 450 nm. The porous structure of Fe3O4 was more obvious on the surface of GMF5. Also, Fe3O4 were rough balls just like raspberries rather than
smooth balls, which further explained that Fe3O4 were self-assembled cluster crystals rather than large single crystals.
We guess that the low contents of RGO and MWCNT affected the self-assembly
process of Fe3O4, or some small flaws of RGO
and MWCNT acted as the crystal nucleus of Fe3O4.

Figure 2 (a) FESEM images of the pure Fe3O4, (b) pure
RGO prepared under the same conditions from GO, and (c, d) GMF5.

The GMF5 was detached from the Cu foil in ethanol
through ultrasonication
and used for TEM characterization. It could be further confirmed that
Fe3O4 were combined with RGO sheets uniformly
interspersed with MWCNTs. Fe3O4 were porous
and assembled by small nanoparticles in three dimension (3D), not
only on the surface. The RGO was plicate and thin, which can be clearly
observed though TEM, and few MWCNTs were interspersed in the RGO and
Fe3O4. From the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM)
image, it can be clearly observed that Fe3O4 was attached to RGO and MWCNTs (Figure 3g). In addition, in Figure 3g, the interplanar distance of 0.49 nm corresponds
to the (111) plane of the cubic phase of GMF5. According to the HRTEM
image (Figure 3c),
pure Fe3O4 shows obvious lattices with the interplanar
distance of 0.25 nm, corresponding well to the (311) plane of the
cubic phase of Fe3O4. Also, Figure 3d shows a series of clear diffraction
rings in the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern, which
can be accurately assigned to the (220), (311), (422), (440), (533),
and (731) facets of Fe3O4. As to GMF5, Figure 3h shows a series
of clear diffraction rings in the SAED pattern, which can accurately
be assigned to the (111), (220), (311), (400), (440), and (511) facets
of Fe3O4.

Raman spectrum was used to characterize the structures of
Fe3O4, GO, RGO, and GMFs. Figure 4 shows that GO and RGO have two broad peaks
at about 1345.2 cm–1 (D band) and about 1586.5 cm–1 (G band), respectively. Also, MWCNTs have three broad
peaks at 1345.2 cm–1 (D band), 1586.5 cm–1 (G band), and 2701.4 cm–1 (2D band), which were
associated with the defect and the graphitic structure of the carbon
atoms.5,43,44 Fe3O4 has no D band or G band but a characteristic peak at
693.3 cm–1, which was also shown in GMF5. For GMF5,
the peaks were at 1347.2 cm–1 (D band) and 1600.9
cm–1 (G band). The peak intensities of D band and
G band were lower, which may be due to the low content of RGO. Compared
to GO or RGO, a shift in the peaks can be found for both D and G bands,
indicating a significant charge transfer between the graphene nanosheets
and Fe3O4. The charge transfer among RGO, MWCNT,
and Fe3O4 was helpful for improving their electrochemical
performance.45−49 This may facilitate the formation of the nanohybrids with more uniform
RGO, MWCNT, and Fe3O4. In addition, the ID/IG values of GO,
RGO, MWCNT, and GMF5 were 1.12, 1.53, 0.99, and 1.71, respectively.
It can be figured out that the value of ID/IG of RGO was higher than that of GO
because the defect density was enlarged in the reduction progress
of RGO.50−52 Also, the value of ID/IG of GMF5 was higher than those of
MWCNT, Fe3O4, GO, and RGO, which may be because
GMF5 cannot be simply mixed with RGO, MWCNT, and Fe3O4; it is more like a kind of nanohybrid. Raman patterns of
GMFs with different amounts of RGOs (GMF0, GMF1, GMF3, GMF5, GMF7,
and GMF15) and different reaction times of GMF5-8h are also displayed
in the Supporting Information (Figure S2). Figure S2 shows the Raman spectra of
GMFs. The value of ID/IG of GMF5-8h was lower than that of GMF5, and it was the
lowest. The reason was that the reaction time of GMF5-8h was less
than that of GMF5 and others (24 h), which means that the reaction
time may affect the value of ID/IG of the GMFs. The values of ID/IG of GMF0, GMF1, GMF3,
GMF5, GMF7, and GMF15 were 2.46, 1.79, 1.93, 1.71, 1.42, and 1.53,
respectively.

Figure 4 Raman patterns of MWCNT, synthesized Fe3O4, GO, RGO, GMF5-8h, and GMF5.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was further utilized to
determine the surface composition of the products and the oxidation
states of Fe and C. Figure 5a shows the typical XPS spectra of GMF0 and GMF5. It shows
the signals of the three elements Fe, O, and C in GMF5. Figure 5b–d shows the Fe 2p,
C 1s, and O 1s peaks of GMF5. Two broad peaks (Figure 5b) centered at 724. 6 and 711.2 eV were assigned
to the spin–orbit split doublet of Fe 2p3/2 and
Fe 2p1/2, respectively, in accordance with the reported
values for Fe3O4.1,49 The C 1s spectrum
(Figure 5c) was divided
into three components. Also, the binding energy peaks at 284.8, 286.4,
and 288.6 eV were attributed to C 1s of C=C, C–O, and
C=O, respectively.53,54 The O 1s spectrum (Figure 5d) was divided into
three components. The binding energy peaks at 529.6, 531.1, and 532.4
eV were attributed to the O (1s) of Fe3O4, OH,
and H2O molecules, respectively.55

2.2 Magnetic Properties
To investigate
the magnetic properties of RGO, Fe3O4, and GMF5,
the vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) test was employed.

Figure 6 displays the room-temperature
hysteresis loops of RGO, Fe3O4, and GMF5 in
the presence of the applied magnetic field ranging from −15 000
to +15 000 Oe. The specific magnetic parameters including the
saturation magnetization (Ms), coercivity
(Hc), and remanent magnetization (Mr) are listed in Table 1.

Figure 6 Hysteresis loops of RGO, Fe3O4, and GMF5
at room temperature.

Table 1 Ms, Hc, and Mr values
of RGO, Fe3O4, and GMF5
samples	Ms (emu/g)	Hc (Oe)	Mr (emu/g)	
RGO	0	0	 	
Fe3O4	79.64	46.62	6.46	
GMF5	79.84	75.45	10.69	
Both
the saturation magnetization (Ms) and
coercivity (Hc) of RGO show zero
values, which means that the RGO had no paramagnetic characteristic.
The values of saturation magnetization (Ms) of Fe3O4 and GMF5 were 79.64 and 79.84 emu/g,
respectively, and display a paramagnetic characteristic, suggesting
that pure Fe3O4 nanoparticles and GMF5 were
actually formed by small nanoparticles, which was highly consistent
with the results of SEM and TEM.56−60

2.3 Microwave Absorption of
the GMFs
To study the microwave absorption of GMFs in detail,
we investigated
the frequency dependence of electromagnetic parameters using wax as
a matrix containing 40 wt % of GMFs, as shown in Figure 7. It was well known that the
real part and imaginary part of the electromagnetic parameters stand
for the storage ability and loss ability of microwave, respectively. Figure 7 shows that the GMFs
have the typical dispersion characteristics, namely, the ε′
values decrease as the measured frequency increases. The dispersion
characteristic may be ascribed to the orientation polarization of
electric dipoles lagging behind the period change of the electric
field.5,61,62

Figure 7 (a, b) Real
and imaginary parts of the permittivity, (c, d) real
and imaginary parts of the permeability, (e) dielectric loss tangent
(tan δε), and (f) magnetic loss tangent
(tan δμ) of GMFs.

Permittivity and permeability are known to mainly originate from
polarization (orientation, interfacial, atomic, and space charge)
and magnetic properties. Also, they may be significantly influenced
by size, composition, structure, and geometrical configuration.1 In addition, Figure 7a,b shows that from GMF0 to GMF15, the permittivities
(real ε′ and imaginary ε″) accordingly increase
positively with the increase of the RGO content with the frequency
in the range of 2–18 GHz.

In detail, the value of ε′
of GMF7 was less than that
of GMF5 from 2 to 6 GHz and the value of ε″ of GMF7 approaches
that of GMF1. As for GMF5-8h, the value of ε′ was much
bigger than that of GMF5 from 2 to 18 GHz; however, the value of ε′′
was a bit less than that of GMF5 from 2 to 5 GHz and was close to
that of GMF5 from 5 to 7 GHz but a little larger than that of GMF5
from 7 to 18 GHz. Under the same reaction conditions, the increase
of the content of RGO had a positive correlation with the real part
of the dielectric constant of the composite, and different reaction
times will also affect the change of the real part of the dielectric
constant. The imaginary part of the dielectric constant of GMF7 does
not increase with the increase of the RGO content. A comparison of
GMF5 and GMF5-8h shows that the reaction time had little effect on
the imaginary part of the dielectric constant.

Figure 7c,d shows
that the permeability (real μ′ and imaginary μ″)
of all the GMFs approach each other with the frequency in the range
2–18 GHz. Figure 7e,f shows the dielectric loss tangent (tan δε) and magnetic loss tangent (tan δμ) of GMFs. The values of tan δε of
GMF0, GMF1, GMF3, and GMF5 were of the order of “GMF0 <
GMF1 < GMF3 < GMF5” with the frequency in the range 2–18
GHz. The value of tan δε of GMF7 was
bigger than that of GMF0 and less than that of GMF1 with the frequency
in the range 2–16 GHz and also less than that of GMF0 with
the frequency in the range 16–18 GHz. The value of tan δε of GMF15 was less than that of GMF5 with the frequency
in the range of 2–6 GHz and more than that of GMF5 with the
frequency in the range of 6–18 GHz. In addition, the value
of tan δε of GMF5-8h was less than that
of GMF5 with the frequency in the range of 2–18 GHz. It is
worth noting that the values of μ″ are negative in some
frequency regions (Figure 7d), suggesting that the GMFs might be used as metamaterials
with negative electromagnetic parameters, which usually show unique
physical properties different from naturally occurring materials.37,63 Similar phenomena have also been found in Fe3O4/C composites.5,55

For practical application,
the reflection loss values need to be
lower than −10 dB, which means that over 90% of the incident
microwave can be absorbed.5Figures 8–10 show the reflection loss curves of GMF0,
GMF1, GMF3, GMF5, GFM5-8h, GMF7, and GMF15. For GMF0, GMF1, GMF3,
GMF5, GMF7, and GMF15, the maximum reflection loss (RL) and the wide
effective absorption bandwidth changed with the increase of the RGO
content. The GMF5 showed a wide effective absorption bandwidth at
8.96–12.32 GHz and reached the maximum RL value of −61.29
dB at 10.48 GHz with a thickness of only 2.6 mm. GMF7 shows two peaks,
wide effective absorption bandwidths at 1.94 and 1.54 GHz, and reached
the maximum RL values of −51.74 dB at 4.80 GHz and −22.62
dB at 15.6 GHz with a thickness of 5.0 mm. GMF5-8h showed a wide effective
absorption bandwidth at 2.64 GHz and reached the maximum RL value
of −39.49 dB at 11.76 GHz with a thickness of 1.9 mm.

Figure 8 (a, b) Frequency-dependent
RL curves and 3D maps of GMF0, (c, d)
GMF1, and (e, f) GMF3.

Figure 9 (a, b) Frequency-dependent
RL curves and 3D maps of GMF5 and (c,
d) GMF5-8h.

Figure 10 (a, b) Frequency-dependent RL curves
and 3D maps of GMF7 and (c,
d) GMF15.

Both the wide effective absorption
bandwidth and the maximum RL
value of GMF5 were better than those of GMF5-8h. With the same ratio
between the three components (RGO, MWCNT, and Fe3O4), GMF5 shows better MA performance than GMF5-8h because GMF5
was prepared with a longer reaction time. The reaction time affects
the nanohybrids by affecting the self-assembly process of GMFs, thus
the structures of GMFs were affected. The longer reaction time could
be beneficial to the growth of Fe3O4 cluster
crystals on RGO, and the hybridization process of the three components
of GMF5 would be better than that of GMF5-8h.

In addition, MA
properties of the other GMFs are described below.
GMF0 shows two peaks, the wide effective absorption bandwidth at 2.08
and 1.76 GHz, and reached the maximum RL value of −18.36 dB
at 5.28 GHz and −19.10 dB at 17.04 GHz with a thickness of
5.5 mm. GMF1 shows two peaks, the wide effective absorption bandwidths
at 4.00–6.32 GHz (2.32 GHz) and 15.12–17.28 GHz (2.16
GHz), and reached the maximum RL value of −34.91 dB at 5.04
GHz and −19.77 dB at 16.24 GHz with a thickness of 5.5 mm.
GMF3 showed a wide effective absorption bandwidth at 5.04–7.68
GHz (2.64 GHz) and reached the maximum RL value of −44.03 dB
at 6.48 GHz with a thickness of 4.4 mm. GMF15 showed a wide effective
absorption bandwidth at 12.80–17.04 GHz (4.24 GHz) and reached
the maximum RL value of −19.55 dB at 14.64 GHz with a thickness
of 1.5 mm.

The proper RGO content, MWCNT content, and assembly
process of
Fe3O4 may induce the porous structure and multiple
interfaces of the GMFs. The porous media and interfaces can cause
multiple scatterings and reflections of the incident microwave.5,64 For GMF5, the multiple interfaces of Fe3O4 cluster crystals, the multiple combined interfaces of Fe3O4, RGO, and MWCNT, the porous structure of GMFs, and
the appropriate contents of RGO and MWCNT regulate the electromagnetic
parameters, which were beneficial for wave attenuation, energy conversion,
and fit to an excellent MA property.65,66 The microwave
absorption properties of other GMFs were less than those of GMF5,
but their microwave absorption properties were not bad, which may
be due to the porous structure and multiple interfaces.

To show
the superiority of GMFs, Table 2 summarizes the microwave absorption performance
of the recently reported graphene-based microwave absorption materials34,62,67−72 and the GMFs in this work. Compared with most of these absorbers,
the GMF5 has low contents of RGO and MWCNT, low cost, and simple synthesis
process, as well as strong microwave absorption intensity, and the
RL value was −61.29 dB at 10.48 GHz with a thickness of only
2.6 mm. The current work gives better results, and the reason was
the synergistic effects among the three components (RGO, MWCNT, and
raspberry-shaped Fe3O4) and their multi-interfacial
porous structure.

The mechanisms contributing to the MA of GMFs are
discussed here.
On the one hand, the large specific surface area of RGO and self-assembled,
porous Fe3O4 formed the multiple interfaces
of GMFs. With the connection of linear MWCNT, the GMFs formed the
whole hybrids, which were beneficial to the transfer and conduction
of electrons, thus improving the MA performance. On the other hand,
the RGO and MWCNT effectively regulated the permittivity and permeability
properties of GMFs, thereby regulating the MA performance. In addition,
the excellent conductivity and thermal conductivity of RGO were beneficial
for transferring the electrons and heat, further improving the GMFs’
efficiency of microwave loss for MA performance.

3 Conclusions
In summary, in this work, we fabricated GMFs
via facile one-step
solvothermal reaction method. The method was facile with no toxic
solvents and conducive to large-scale preparation. The change of RGO
content can regulate the electromagnetic parameters of the GMFs. The
MWCNTs act as a bridge to connect with the RGO and Fe3O4 and helps the transfer of the electron. Fe3O4 were porous clusters composed of many small single crystals,
which provided a three-dimensional absorbing space; thus, the electromagnetic
wave would experience multiple reflections in the 3D porous structure.
Thus, the overall specific surface area was large, which was conducive
to the better absorption of electromagnetic waves. When the mass ratio
of GO, MWCNT, and Fe3O4 was 5:1:73 and the reaction
time of solvothermal reaction was 24 h, the maximum RL value of GMF5
was −61.29 dB at 10.48 GHz with a thickness of only 2.6 mm,
and its effective microwave absorption bandwidth (RL < −10
dB) was at 8.96–12.32 GHz. By tuning the thickness of GMF5,
the effective microwave absorption bandwidth was in the range from
3.52 to 18 GHz.

Hummers method.73,74 In brief, 2.0 g of graphite powder
(8000 mesh) was stirred in 100 mL of concentrated H2SO4 for about 6 min at 11 °C. Then, 12.0 g of KMnO4 was added and the mixture stirred by a magnetic stirrer for 30 min
maintained below 20 °C; then, the temperature of the mixture
was maintained at 35 °C for 2 h. One hundred fifty milliliters
of ultrapure water and about 5.0 mL of H2O2 (30
vol %) were added dropwise. When the temperature of the mixture dropped
to room temperature, about 500 mL of ultrapure water and about 1.85
vol % HCl solution were added. The mixture was made to stand overnight
and the supernatant was poured out. If the mixture cannot be layered,
it was washed and centrifuged by ultrapure water and 5 vol % HCl solution
until it was neutral (pH = 7); then, it was freeze-dried for 48 h.

4.3 Preparation of Fe3O4 Nanoparticles
Fe3O4 were prepared
by solvothermal process.30 In detail, 10
mmol FeCl3·6H2O and 61 mmol NaAc were dissolved
in 20 and 40 mL of ethylene glycol, respectively. They were mixed,
and the mixture was stirred by a magnetic stirrer until the suspension
spread evenly. Next, the mixture was sonicated for 5 min. Then, the
mixture was poured into a 150 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave
and the temperature was maintained at 180 °C for 24 h. The black
products were washed five times with ethanol and ultrapure water and
then freeze-dried for 48 h.

4.4 Preparation of GMFs
The GMFs were
prepared facilely by an in situ one-pot solvothermal method. The schematic
of the synthesis procedure of the GMFs was shown in Scheme 1. First, 0.01 g of MWCNT and
a series of GO (0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, and 0.15 g) were dispersed
in 10 mL of ethylene glycol by sonicating for 5 min. Then, 10 mmol
FeCl3·6H2O and 61 mmol NaAc were dissolved
in 60 mL of ethylene glycol, stirred, and sonicated for 10 min until
the suspension spread evenly. Next, the EG dispersion of GO/MWCNT
and the EG dispersion of FeCl3·6H2O and
NaAc were mixed, and the mixture was stirred and sonicated for about
10 min until the suspension spread evenly. The mixture was poured
into a 150 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and the temperature
maintained at 180 °C for 24 h. The black products were washed
five times with ethanol and ultrapure water and freeze-dried for 48
h. The raw material ratio and the corresponding sample abbreviations
are shown in the Supporting Information (Table S1).

Scheme 1 Schematic of the Synthesis Procedure of the GMFs
4.5 Characterization
The X-ray diffraction
diffractometer (Rigaku MiniFlex 600) was used to investigate the phase
structures of the products, using Cu Kα radiation from 10 to
90° with the scan rate of 5°/min. A scanning electron microscope
(HITACHI S-4800(II)) and a transmission electron microscope (JEOL
JEM-2100) were applied to examine the microstructures and morphologies
of the products. A Raman spectroscopy system (HJY LABRAM) was used
to investigate the structure and ID/IG of the products. An X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(Thermo ESCALAB 250XI) was used to investigate the surface states
of GMFs.

A vibration sample magnetometer (LakeShore 7404) was
employed to measure the hysteresis loops of the products, which was
applied at a maximum magnetic field of 18 kOe at room temperature.
An Agilent E5071C network analyzer was applied to measure the microwave
absorption properties of the products at 2–18 GHz according
to the coaxial-line method. The toroidal samples (inner diameter Φin = 3.04 mm, outer diameter Φout = 7.00 mm,
and sample thickness d = 2.00–3.50 mm) for
microwave-absorbing measurements were fabricated by homogeneously
mixing the paraffin wax with products (mass ratio = 4:6). The samples
had the same name as their corresponding GMFs. The test software was
Keysight Technologies N1500A, and the test mode was Nicholson–Ross–Well,
and the measurement frequency range was 2–18 GHz. Next, the
values of ε′, ε″, μ′, and μ′′
can be calculated via the test software that has been installed by
Agilent E5071C network analyzer. Finally, the RL values can be calculated
based on the transmission line theory.75,76 1   2  where Zin is the
input impedance at the absorber surface, Z0 is the impedance of the air, f is the microwave
frequency, d is the thickness of the absorber, and c is the velocity of light in free space. εr (εr = ε′ – jε″)
and μr (μr = μ′ –
jμ″) are the complex permittivity and permeability of
the absorber, respectively.
