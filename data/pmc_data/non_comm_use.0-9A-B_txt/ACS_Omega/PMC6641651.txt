Nanotechnology, the
manipulation of matter on atomic, molecular,
and supramolecular scales, has become the most appealing strategy
for biomedical applications and is of great interest as an approach
to preventing microbial risks. In this study, we utilize the antimicrobial
performance and the drug-loading ability of novel nanoparticles based
on silicon oxide and strontium-substituted hydroxyapatite to develop
nanocomposite antimicrobial films based on a poly(l-lactic
acid) (PLLA) polymer. We also demonstrate that nanoimprint lithography
(NIL), a process adaptable to industrial application, is a feasible
fabrication technique to modify the surface of PLLA, to alter its
physical properties, and to utilize it for antibacterial applications.
Various nanocomposite PLLA films with nanosized (black silicon) and
three-dimensional (hierarchical) hybrid domains were fabricated by
thermal NIL, and their bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus
aureus was assessed. Our findings demonstrate that
besides hydrophobicity the nanoparticle antibiotic delivery and the
surface roughness are essential factors that affect the biofilm formation.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The tendency of bacterial
cells to adhere to and colonize a material
surface is a fundamental challenge underlying various biomaterial-associated
applications ranging from surgical sutures to tissue engineering scaffolds,
medical implants, and drug-eluting devices.1,2 To
eliminate or substantially reduce the extent of bacterial attachment
and biofilm formation on biomaterial surfaces, intensive efforts have
been focussed on the development of new surfaces or on the improvement
of the performance of existing antibacterial materials.3

New strategies for designing antibacterial
substrates, mediated
by topographical features of micro- and/or nanometer scales, are gaining
increasing interest aside from the conventional chemistry-based approaches.4 On such a geometrically patterned surface, the
bacteria are enclosed and are surrounded by slopes, slants, walls,
wells, or other architectural shapes. In a recent report, nanoscale-inspired
microdomains on a polyurethane catheter were shown to reduce bacterial
colonization of the surface.5 The confined
surface topography with pillars of defined geometric shapes limits
the attachment such that bacteria have less contact area between the
pillars on the surface when compared to that on smooth unpatterned
substrates. In fact, biomimicry of antibacterial surfaces in nature
is a popular strategy. These kinds of antibacterial surface-treated
substrates were first explored on shark skin and lotus leaves, and
a due acknowledgment must be given to these early findings.6

The nanocomposite approach has been also
proved to be significantly
beneficial for the preparation of bactericidal surfaces. Nanostructured
noble metals with considerable antimicrobial activity, most commonly,
silver in its various forms (nanoparticles, nanolayers, and nanowires,
etc.), might be used effectively.7,8 These antimicrobial
agents (i) might be incorporated throughout the volume of polymeric
matrix or (ii) might form coatings on the polymeric surface. Their
presence in the polymer matrix causes the reduction of initial microbial
adhesion to surfaces and inactivation of microorganisms already adherent
to a surface. An additional advantage of nanoparticles is their high
surface-area-to-volume ratio. This property, in comparison with the
high porosity of nanoparticles in some cases, enables high loading
of therapeutics like drugs, with promising synergy arising from multivalent
interactions between drugs and the surface of nanoparticles.9,10

Given this foundation, in this study, nanoparticle-based antibiotic
carriers like mesoporous strontium hydroxyapatite nanorods (SrHA nrds)
and silica nanotubes (SiO2 ntbs) will be prepared and used
for chloramphenicol (CAM) antibiotic drug loading and re-engineered
to not only attack and kill but also nonlethally manipulate the physiologies
of bacteria. In particular, sol–gel-synthesized SrHA nrds,
because of their inner space that can be filled by pharmaceutical
molecules and because of the antibacterial properties of strontium
ions, have been investigated as antibiotic carriers with bactericidal
effect.11,12 In addition, tailored SiO2 ntbs
with tunable surface functionality and multivalency have been synthesized
using a facile sol–gel route and examined for their potential
to entrap antibiotics and target bacteria.13 These nanoparticles will be used for the preparation of antibacterial
film nanocomposites with poly(lactic acid) containing 1 wt % SrHA
nrds or SiO2 ntbs loaded with chloramphenicol (CAM) drug.

Except nanoparticles or drugs, it was reported that polymer surfaces
also play an important role in antibacterial activity.14 For example, it was found that “black
silicon” (BS) and nano-pillar-type structures are the most
effective surfaces with appropriate bactericidal properties. The bactericidal
action through physical surface topography, which has been associated
with the deforming stress applied by these nanoarchitectures, is highly
dependent on certain external factors, including the size, shape,
density, rigidity/flexibility, and surface chemistry of the surface
nanotextures, as well as factors such as bacterial specificity (e.g.,
Gram-positive and Gram-negative) and motility.6 Thus, in the present study, to maximize the antibacterial properties
of CAM-loaded nanoparticles, similar nanostructures of poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) nanocomposites in the form of thin films will
be prepared using nanoimprint lithography (NIL). By integrating the
most remarkable strategies for designing antibacterial coatings, nanocomposite
approach, and the implementation of micro- and nanosized topographies,
we aim at fabricating antimicrobial-treated films based on PLLA. Owing
to its beneficial properties, such as high mechanical strength, excellent
thermoforming ability, biocompatibility, and monomer renewability,
PLLA is the most widely used polyester for biomedical applications.15,16

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Physicochemical
and Morphological Study of
SrHA nrds and SiO2 ntbs
Sol–gel techniques
have been extensively used to form silica gel nanotubes and mesoporous
silica nanotubes.17−19 Adachi et al. were the first to study surfactant-assisted
growth for the formation of very long silica nanotubes.20 Here, tube formation was followed by trimethylsilylation
treatment, using citric acid (CA) as a structure modifier. The main
advantage of the trisylation treatment is that it inactivated the
silanol groups among the different bundles, yielding long individual
SiO2 ntbs, whereas another advantage of the method used
is that the surfactant was removed without calcination. Moreover,
previous reported results confirm that both the use of CA and external
synthetic conditions control the formation of particular structures
of silica. In contrast, a rapid addition of ammonia and CA under static
conditions leads to the formation of micrometer-sized rods with uniform
morphologies.17 Here, the slow addition
of ammonia/CA under vigorous stirring was ideal for the development
of desired silica structures.

Figure 1a gives the transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) image of the as-synthesized SiO2 ntbs. It is shown
that long single-wall nanotubes with uniform wide diameters together
with some nanoparticles coexisted in the as-synthesized powder. The
length of the tubes ranged from hundreds of nanometers to tens of
micrometers (∼0.5–20 μm). From the high-magnification
image of a typical nanotube (Figure 1b), it can be seen that the center of the material
is light and both the edges are dark, showing the well-defined structure
of the nanotube. The inner diameters of the tubes are about 500 and
130 nm and the outer diameters of nanotubes vary from 800 to 100 nm,
whereas the head part of the tube indicates that the channel is open
(Figure 1b). SiO2 ntbs are the novel nanoparticles that exhibited excellent
possibilities as multifunctional drug carriers. More particularly,
nanotubes with open ends, which allow both inside and outside surfaces
to interact with drug molecules, offer a large surface-to-volume ratio
and thus improve the drug-loading capacity.21

Figure 1 TEM
observations of SiO2 ntbs at a (a) low and (b) high
resolution.

It is well proven that
different methods, such as co-precipitation,
sol–gel technique, solid-state reaction, combustion technique,
spray pyrolysis, hydrothermal method, microwave irradiation process,
etc., can be employed for the synthesis of nanohydroxyapatite with
controlled structural and morphological characteristics.22,23 Here, as demonstrated through TEM observations in Figure 2, SrHA nrds were successfully
synthesized via a simple hydrothermal synthesis (sol–gel) route,
with average length of 200–400 nm and diameter of ∼20
nm. In Figure 2c,d,
it is well documented that mesoporous structures were successfully
introduced into the as-obtained SrHA nanorods because of the presence
of organic additive cetyltrimethyl-ammonium bromide (CTAB) during
the hydrothermal synthesis, followed by the treatment with refluxing
acetone to remove it. Mesoporosity is very important because it not
only offers high surface area that could be used to conjugate different
functional groups but also provides a large accessible pore volume
for small absorbable biomolecules or even functional nanoparticles.24

Figure 2 (a–d) Low- and high-angle annular dark-field scanning
transmission
electron microscopy images of SrHA nrds where the mesopores are observed.

The chemical compositions of SiO2 ntbs and SrHA nrds
were studied by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The
broad peak from 3600 to 3200 cm–1 in the spectrum
corresponding to SiO2 ntbs (Figure 3a) can be assigned to the characteristic
absorption of the O–H stretching. The peaks at 1100 cm–1 are because of the −Si–O–Si–
stretching of the silica network, whereas the asymmetric stretching
of Si–O–Si (νSi–O–Si) is obvious
at 473 cm–1. The stretching vibrations of Si–OH
(νSi–OH) groups appear at about 810 cm–1.25Figure 3b shows the FT-IR spectrum of the SrHA nrds. The typical
bands of apatite can be seen in this figure. The absorption peaks
at 1082 and 1017 cm–1 are ascribed to the asymmetric
stretching vibrations of P–O, whereas the group of bands in
the low-wavenumber range centered at 598 and 561 cm–1 is assigned to the bending vibrations of O–P–O in
PO43– groups. The bands at 3447 cm–1 arise out of the O–H stretching, and the two
weak bands observed at 1413 and 1435 cm–1 can be
attributed to the carbon-related impurities, due to the presence of
CO2 in the aqueous solution or air during the process of
measuring.26

Figure 3 a, b) FT-IR spectra and
(c, d) X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
of SiO2 ntbs and SrHA nrds.

Powder XRD pattern of SiO2 ntbs in Figure 3c shows that only one broad
peak appears at about 2θ 23–24°, indicating that
the silica framework is amorphous. In contrast, the peaks appearing
in the XRD pattern of the SrHA nrds are strong and narrow, indicating
that the as-prepared sample was well crystallized despite the fact
that relatively moderate reaction conditions were used (Figure 3d). The diffraction peaks at
2θ 26.8, 24.6, 30.6, and 31.8° are characteristic of the
polycrystalline nature indexed to the (102), (002), (211), and (112)
planes of the hexagonal phase of Sr10(PO4)6(OH)2, respectively, demonstrating that the pure
SrHA crystals were obtained.27

2.2 Characterization of CAM-Loaded SrHA nrds and
CAM-Loaded SiO2 ntbs
As confirmed by TEM observations,
one-dimensional SiO2 ntbs display structures that provide
unique characteristics such a very uniform diameter and being open
at both ends. Chen and co-workers were the first to report silica
tubular-structured materials as biomolecule carriers.28 In their study, it was proved that the monkey kidney cells exhibited green fluorescence
protein (GFP) expression when nanotubes filled with the gene encoding
GFP entered these cells. Essentially, the fluorescent properties of
the nanotubes allowed visualizing their localization in the living
cells. Table 1 displays
the drug loading and entrapment efficiency of SiO2 ntbs
prepared using the sol–gel methods. The least chloramphenicol
(CAM) antibacterial drug loading (4.88 ± 0.48%) and entrapment
efficiency (3.14 ± 0.23%) was found in SiO2 ntbs prepared
using the sol–gel method. These observations demonstrate a
new potential application of nanotubes in biomolecule delivery because,
except for DNA or drug molecules, RNA, proteins, antibiotics, and
other biomolecules could also be loaded into the nanotubes. Moreover,
the size of the nanotubes could be controlled and adjusted according
to the size and the amount of cargo molecules, as a smaller nanovector
might increase the transfection or delivery efficiency.29

Table 1 Drug Loading and
Encapsulation Efficiency
of SrHA nrds and SiO2 ntbs
samplea	drug loading (%)	encapsulation efficiency (%)	
CAM-loaded SrHA nrds	6.27 ± 0.74	4.03 ± 0.32	
CAM-loaded SiO2 ntbs	4.88 ± 0.48	3.14 ± 0.23	
a Three measurements per condition
were obtained. Standard deviation (σ) has been calculated using
the following formula: .

Slightly increased drug
loading (6.27 ± 0.74%) and entrapment
efficiency (4.03 ± 0.32%) were obtained in the case of mesoporous
SrHA nrds (Table 1).
In a previous study, we found that SrHAp nrds have a surface area
of 45 m2/g and a pore volume of 0.485 cm3/g.26 Although these results show that SrHAp nrds
have relatively low surface area compared to that of other aluminosilicate
minerals, such as zeolites (500–1000 m2/g), they
also demonstrate that they possess big meso- and macropores with an
average size of about 15–200 nm and high external surface area.
Indeed, it has been previously proven that mesoporous hydroxyapatite
is an ideal drug carrier owing to its bioactvity, biocompatibility,
porous structure, and numerous phosphate groups. Concerning SrHA nrds,
they are well known to be used for antibiotic and anticancer drug
delivery or for adsorbing heavy metals from wastewater.26 From the present study, it can be concluded
that the tunable mesopore structure of SrHA nrds allows the incorporation
of CAM drug molecules.

FT-IR spectra were analyzed to investigate
whether there are any
chemical interactions between the chloramphenicol active pharmaceutical
ingredient (CAM API) drug and the nanoparticles. FT-IR spectra of
CAM API, SiO2 ntbs, and SrHA nrds (before and after drug
loading) are shown in Figure 4a,b. The characteristic infrared peaks of CAM API indicate
O–H, N–H, and C–H stretching vibrations between
2900 and 3500 cm–1.30 The characteristic sharp peak corresponding to C=O of the
carbonyl group appears at 1683 cm–1, whereas the
nitrogen dioxide (NO2) group shows an intense double peak
between 1400 and 1550 cm–1, assigned to the N=O
stretching vibrational mode. For the drug-loaded forms, C=O
and N=O peaks of chloramphenicol can be observed, suggesting
that chloramphenicol slightly interacted with the surface of the NPs
and that it was not completely entrapped in their cavities.31

Figure 4 a, b) FT-IR spectra and (c, d) XRD patterns of SiO2 ntbs
and SrHA nrds before and after CAM loading.

Furthermore, almost all of the peaks appearing in the spectra
of
CAM-loaded SrHA nrds and CAM-loaded SiO2 ntbs were the
same as those of the pure SrHA nrds and SiO2 ntbs, with
no changes observed in the intensities. (Figure 4a,b). This seems to indicate the absence
of chemical interaction between the NPs and the chloramphenicol drug.
Interestingly, end functionalization of SrHA nrds and SiO2 ntbs may be able to control drug release, resulting in their wide
range of applications in controlled drug and gene delivery; also,
their distinctive inner and outer surfaces can be differentially functionalized,
making silica nanotubes ideal multifunctional nanostructure candidates
for biomedical applications in various areas, such as biosensing,
bioseparation, and biocatalysis.24,29

XRD
measurements were also performed in CAM API and in CAM-loaded
NPs to identify the physical state of the drug. As can be seen from
the XRD data (Figure 4c,d), the XRD pattern of pure CAM shows many sharp diffraction peaks
at 2θ 10.76, 12.82, 18.90, 25.88, and 31.62°. Because the
main characteristic peaks of CAM were not recorded in the drug-loaded
forms, we can assume that it was entrapped in the amorphous state,
which is very normal when inorganic particles with high surface area
of 100–1000 m2/g are used for drug loading.31 However, the absence of the main characteristic
peaks of CAM could also be due to the low drug loading.

Nanoparticles
provide a versatile platform in designing materials
for antimicrobial therapy. NP-based antimicrobial agents can be readily
used for ex vivo applications such as sterilizers for surfaces and
devices. Moreover, excellent biofilm penetration enhances their activity
toward a range of biofilm-based infections. The most accessible target
in the near future includes the topical applications of NP-based systems
for wound healing.7 Here, tunable surface
functionality and multivalence of SrHA nrds and SiO2 ntbs
make them promising antimicrobial agents, whereas localized delivery
of the CAM antibiotic increases the therapeutic efficacy of CAM-loaded-SrHA
nrds and CAM-loaded-SiO2 ntbs.10,32,33

2.3 Antibacterial Activity
of CAM-Loaded-SrHA
ntbs and CAM-Loaded-SiO2 ntbs
The antibacterial
activity of CAM-loaded-SrHA ntbs and CAM-loaded-SiO2 ntbs
was determined using the minimum inhibitory concentration method against
four bacteria: Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Benthesicymus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus. SrHA ntbs
and SiO2 ntbs were also used as negative controls. Both
CAM-loaded ntbs exhibited dose-dependent antibacterial activity against
all of the bacteria tested. They were most effective against E. coli with an IC50 value of 51.37 μg/mL
for CAM-loaded-SrHA ntbs and 57.32 μg/mL for CAM-loaded-SiO2 ntbs (Table 2). The observed antibacterial activity of CAM-loaded-SrHA ntbs seems
to be slightly higher than that of CAM-loaded-SiO2 ntbs
against E. coli, B.
subtilis, and S. aureus, whereas their difference was higher in the case of B. cereus.

Table 2 Antibacterial Activity
of SrHA nrds,
SiO2 ntbs, CAM-Loaded-SrHA ntbs, and CAM-Loaded-SiO2 ntbs
IC50 (μg/mL)	E. coli	B. subtilis	B. cereus	S. aureus	
CAM-loaded SrHA nrds	51.37	162.44	83.72	119.02	
CAM-loaded SiO2 ntbs	57.32	167.50	123.43	131.10	
SrHA ntbs	140.13	223.51	143.94	187.83	
SiO2 ntbs	310.92	209.03	224.42	209.73	
However, even if the biocompatibility of silica-based
and hydroxyapatite-based
nanoparticles makes them especially ideal carriers for applications
associated with the human body, further studies at the fundamental,
biological, and pharmacological levels are required to enable systemic
administration of these antimicrobials.7

2.4 Black Silicon and Hierarchical Surface Design
by Means of Thermal NIL
Although the NIL processes are mainly
used to produce high-aspect-ratio silicon surfaces for designing semiconductors
and photovoltaic materials, very recently they have been used in some
biological applications to produce features ranging from tens of micrometers
down to hundreds of nanometers.34−36 In the present study, the formation
of nano- and hierarchical (micro and nano) structures on the surface
of PLLA has been investigated by means of thermal NIL to produce PLLA
nanocomposite surfaces with antibacterial properties. As it can be seen in Figure 5, random cone- and needle-shaped nanostructures,
1–2 μm tall and 300–500 nm in diameter, were faithfully
replicated on the surface of PLLA by thermal NIL for the first time.
Because of the high aspect ratios, the etched nanostructure sometimes
is antireflective and turns black after the etching and is therefore
termed as black silicon (BS).4 Interestingly,
antireflective nanostructures, which have been inspired by objects
in nature, such as insect wings and the surfaces of insect eyes, have
also the potential to generating a mechanical bactericidal effect,
killing both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria at high rates.37

Figure 5 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the black
silicon
nanostructured PLLA surface at different magnifications.

Moreover, to increase the surface roughness and
to decrease the
solid–liquid contact function, we tried to combine micro- with
nanoscale patterning.5 In Figure 6, we present the novel three-dimensional
(3D) hierarchical domains on the surface of PLLA. It can be seen that
cylindrical micropillars with 40 μm width or diameter and 40
μm height decorated with BS nanostructures on the top surface
were successfully fabricated. Given the growing interest in the development
of biomimetic antibacterial surfaces, these results may be useful,
offering an alternative geometry for production of nanoscale antibacterial
surfaces.

Figure 6 Tilted SEM images of the 3D hierarchical domains on the surface
of PLLA (black silicon nanostructures on micropillars) at different
magnifications.

In addition, neither
CAM-free nor CAM-loaded SrHA nrds and SiO2 ntbs affected
the NIL process negatively because nice black
silicon and hierarchical structures were obtained also for the PLLA
nanocomposite films. In Figure 7, the presence of the nanoparticles loaded with CAM and their
good dispersion in the polymer matrix can be seen in the main body
of the micropillars. The lack of agglomerates could be attributed
to the spin-coating method that was used for the preparation of the
PLLA nanocomposite thin films.

Figure 7 Left: SEM observation of one micropillar
on the surface of PLLA/CAM-loaded
SrHA nrds 1%. Right: SEM observation of one micropillar on the surface
of PLLA/CAM-loaded SiO2 ntbs 1%.

To quantify the bactericidal properties of the black silicon
and
the 3D hierarchical surfaces, two species of bacteria were incubated
on each surface for periods up to 24 h and the bacterial viability
was monitored. The bacterial species examined represented the major
prokaryotic taxa and included Gram-negative E. coli and Gram-positive S. aureus. We
calculated the ratio of cell density on each patterned surface with
respect to the corresponding upatterned surface (control sample).
As shown in Figures 8 and 9, we consistently measured lower cell
densities on the patterned surfaces (PLLA or SrHA nrds and PLLA or
SiO2 ntbs) than on the flat surfaces (PLLA or SrHA nrds
Hier PLLA or SiO2 ntbs Hier). Additionally, the results
plotted in Figures 8 and 9 clearly show that the cellular density
depends on the surface geometry, as the hierarchical surfaces show
a further decrease in cell density compared to that on the corresponding
nanostructured black silicon surfaces.38 These results are in good agreement with a previous study, in which
bSi and dragonfly wing surfaces were effective not only against the
Gram-negative E. coli cells but also
against the Gram-positive S. aureus cells.6,37

Figure 9 Antibacterial activity against S. aureus after 24 h of incubation.

In addition to the physical effects of nanostructures and
micro-
or nanostructures, the chemical effects, because of the presence of
chloramphenicol in the case of PLLA/CAM-loaded SrHA nrds and PLLA/CAM-loaded
SiO2 ntbs samples, play important roles in conjunction
with the physical ones on the bactericidal effects. Chloramphenicol
enters the bacteria by an energy-dependent process. Its antibiotic
activity is due to competitive inhibition for the binding of aminoacyl
tRNA to the peptidyltransferase domain of the 50S subunit.39 By incorporating a “smart” bacteria-triggered
nano or micro-/nanostructure, a greater exposure of the antibiotic
to the adhering bacteria was provided, and it led to an increase in
the antibacterial efficiency of the PLLA/CAM-loaded SrHA nrds BS and
PLLA/CAM-loaded SiO2 ntbs BS samples compared to
that of the unpatterned PLLA/CAM-loaded SrHA nrds and PLLA/CAM-loaded
SiO2 ntbs flat surfaces, respectively.38 Furthermore, an additional advantage comes from the reduction
of bacterial adhesion and an increase in their susceptibility to antibiotic
when bacteria land on the 3D PLLA/CAM-loaded SrHA nrds Hier and PLLA/CAM-loaded
SiO2 ntbs Hier structures. The demonstrated strategy of
a synergistic combination of advanced 3D nanostructuring and antibiotic
nanoparticulated delivery holds a great promise for engineering of
bacteria-resistant PLLA surfaces.

Viability staining was also
coupled with SEM imaging after 24 h
bacterial adhesion. We fixed the bacterial cells with glutaraldehyde
(as mentioned in Section 2) before SEM imaging, which crosslinks the proteins, making
the cell more resistant to changes under vacuum. The morphology and
distribution of all of the cells that attached to the surface of the
“flat” unpatterned PLLA and SrHA nrds 1 wt %, which
acted as control surface, were found to be significantly different
from those of the cells attached to PLLA/CAM-loaded SrHA nrds 1 wt
% BS and PLLA/CAM-loaded SrHA nrds 1 wt % Hier surfaces (Figure 10).

Figure 10 SEM analysis, the reference
strain SEM observations of “rod-shaped” E. coli and “coccoid-shaped” S. aureus on flat unpatterned, black silicon, and
hierarchical domains on the surface of the PLLA/CAM-loaded SrHA nrds
1% sample.

Rod-shaped E. coli and coccoid-shaped S. aureus cells adhered horizontally and appeared
to remain in a healthy state (turgid) on the flat unpatterned surface.
In contrast, on the black silicon and hierarchical surface, a proportion
of the cells appeared to be flat and nonturgid.40 Thus, the greater nonuniformity of the surface appeared
to effectively damage a higher percentage of the bacterial cells,
which is consistent with the results from the Live/Dead assays. Although
on nano and micro-/nanostructures, bacteria appeared deflated as they
stretched over several pillars, SEM observations did not explain the
underlying mechanism behind the higher killing efficiency of the hierarchical
surfaces, and further studies will be necessary to throw some light
on this complex procedure.3

Nanomaterials
that possess topographical features with high aspect
ratios frequently display remarkable surface properties such as high
hydrophobicity that is often related to cell attachment and biofilm
formation.4,41 This could also play, maybe, an important
role in the antimicrobial properties of the prepared surfaces. To
check this, in our study, water contact angle measurements have been
also carried out. From the results presented in Table 3, it is clear that the hierarchical surfaces
were highly hydrophobic, whereas the black silicon surfaces were relatively
lower in hydrophobicity. These results indicate that it is difficult
to achieve the superhydrophobicity property because of nanoscale topography
alone and hierarchical roughness is essential to impart these properties.42 Although our findings suggest that highly hydrophobic
surfaces do inhibit the attachment of bacterial cells,6 many studies have also shown that there is no direct relationship
between superhydrophobicity and antibacterial activity.43 However, from our results, it seems that the
high hydrophobicity of hierarchical structures could also be because
of their higher antimicrobial properties.

3 Conclusions
We have
demonstrated that strategies that confine antibacterial
property to PLLA, by encapsulating chloramphenicol-loaded nanoparticles
and by imprinting nano- and micro-/nanodomains on the surface of nanocomposite
PLLA films by NIL, are very promising. The results of this work indicate
that both E. coli and S. aureus cells attached onto the nanostructured
and micro-/nanostructured surfaces to a smaller extent compared to
that on the unpatterned smooth samples. The hierarchical fabricated
PLLA/CAM-loaded SrHA nrds 1% and PLLA/CAM-loaded SiO2 ntbs
1% surfaces were particularly effective against the pathogens, as
the 3D surface allowed a greater exposure of the antibiotic to the
adhering bacteria and increased the antibacterial efficiency. It is
thus suggested that repelling the bacteria from the surface and at
the same time killing the ones that managed to adhere to the patterned
surface by the nanoparticle antibiotic delivery platforms could be
the most effective strategy for antibacterial surface design. However,
this scientific field is new and much of the important work is still
in the proof-of-concept stage.

polished, p-type (boron) total thickness variation < 10 μm]
were supplied by MicroChemicals. Chloroform (CHCl3) (99.5%)
was obtained from Chem-Lab NV. All of the other materials and solvents
used in the analytical methods were of analytical grade.

4.2 Synthesis of SrHA nrds and SiO2 ntbs
Single
SiO2 nanotubes (SiO2 ntbs)
were synthesized by modifying a previously reported sol–gel
process.17 Ethanol, water, TEOS, and ammonia
were used as chemical sources. Citric acid (CA) monohydrate was also
employed as a structural modifier. In a typical synthetic procedure,
6.0 mL of TEOS was added to the mixed solution of 0.7 mL of H2O and 30 mL of EtOH. Then, 12 mL of NH4OH (28%
aqueous solution) containing 0.18 g of CA monohydrate was added dropwise
into the homogenous solution for 2 h under vigorous magnetic stirring.
The as-obtained mixture was transferred into a Teflon bottle (80 mL),
held in a stainless steel autoclave, sealed, and maintained at 200
°C for 24 h. As the autoclave cooled to room temperature naturally,
the precipitate was washed centrifugally with distilled water and
dried in an oven at 75 °C.

To synthesize SrHA nrds, we
followed a previously described hydrothermal process involving the
autoclave treatment of Sr(NO3)2 (3 mmol), CTAB
(0.5 g), ammonia solution (NH4OH) (10 mL), trisodium citrate
(6 mmol), and (NH4)2HPO4 (2 mmol).18

4.3 Drug Loading of SrHA nrds
and SiO2 ntbs
Drug loading of SiO2 ntbs
and SrHA nrds
was performed by mixing, in the dark and under a nitrogen atmosphere,
50 mg of SrHA nrds or SiO2 ntbs with aqueous solutions
of chloramphenicol of selected concentration for 24 h to achieve an
initial concentration of 150 μg/mg of nanoparticles. The chloramphenicol-loaded
formulations, CAM-loaded SiO2 ntbs and CAM-loaded SrHA
nrds, were filtered, washed with 25 mL of water to remove the unloaded
drug, and dried at room temperature.

4.4 Characterization
of SrHA nrds and SiO2 ntbs before and after Drug Loading
The morphology
of the as-synthesized nanoparticles was studied using transmission
electron microscopy (TEM). TEM imaging of SiO2 ntbs was
conducted using JEOL JEM-1400PLUS (40–120 kV) equipped with
a GATAN US1000 charge-coupled device camera. An aliquot of 3.5 μL
of each sample was deposited on a carbon film, 400 mesh copper (50/pk)
grid, and left to evaporate at room temperature. Bright field transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images of SrHA nrds were acquired using
a FEI Tecnai G2 microscope operated at 200 kV. Samples adequate for
transmission electron microscopy were prepared by drop-casting the
ethanol solution containing the particles on holey, carbon-coated
copper grids.

To evaluate the chemical composition and the crystal
structure of SrHA nrds and SiO2 ntbs before and after drug
loading, the as-synthesized nanoparticles and the CAM-loaded formulations
were examined using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR)
and X-ray diffractometry (XRD). FT-IR spectra were obtained using
a Perkin–Elmer FT-IR spectrometer, model Spectrum One, in absorbance
mode, in the spectral region of 400–4000 cm–1, using a resolution of 4 cm–1 and 64 co-added
scans. XRD patterns of the samples were collected using a MiniFlex
II XRD system from Rigaku Co. X-ray diffraction measurements were
carried out over the range 2θ from 5 to 30°, at steps of
0.05° and counting time of 5.

The drug-loading content
and encapsulation efficiency of CAM-loaded
formulations were determined indirectly by calculating spectrophotometrically
the free drug in the combined filtrate and washing waters normalized
at 25 mL, using a calibration curve. The calibration curve was created
by diluting a stock aqueous solution of 400 ppm CAM to concentrations
of 1, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 ppm and then measuring the UV–vis
absorbance at 278 nm. The following equations were applied to calculate
the drug-loading content and encapsulation efficiency

 1   2  Moreover,
screening of the antibacterial activity
of CAM-free and CAM-loaded nanoparticles was performed by determining
the half-minimal inhibitory concentration (IC50) [against E. coli (BL21), B. subtilis (ATCC 6633), B. cereus (ATCC 11778),
and S. aureus (ATCC 25923), according
to the method described recently by Varna et al.44].

4.5 Preparation of PLLA Nanocomposite
Thin Films
by Spin-Coating
Nanocomposites based on PLLA matrix were
prepared according to the following procedure. First, PLLA was dissolved
in chloroform to form a 10 wt % solution using magnetic stirring for
2 h at room temperature. At the same time, SrHA nrds, SiO2 ntbs, CAM-loaded SrHA nrds, and CAM-loaded SiO2 ntbs
were weighted to achieve the desired final concentration (1 wt % on
the basis of the weight of the composite material) and dispersed separately
using magnetic stirring for 2 h and ultrasonication for 20 min. In
the second step, both the polymer solution and the suspensions of
the nanoparticles were mixed, stirred (2 h), and sonicated (15 min)
to form nanocomposites with 1% weight fraction. The produced nanocomposite
PLLA films were spin-coated on silicon substrates, cut into 2 cm ×
2 cm square-pieces. Several coating speeds were tested to achieve
the desired thickness, which was dependent on the used featured height.
Before spin-coating, our Si wafers were O2 plasma-treated
(O2 flow = 50 sccm, N2 = 50 sccm, pressure =
100 mTorr, and power = 50 W) to enhance the polymer adherence and
to eliminate any organic residuals that the samples might had.

4.6 Patterning of PLLA Nanocomposite Thin Films
by Thermal Nanoimprint Lithography
Before the thermal NIL
step, a hot-plate-induced soft bake was performed at 100 °C for
15 min to ensure that no solvent remained in the polymer nanocomposites.
During our experimental work, thermal NIL was performed using a commercial
desktop 4 in. CNI tool obtained from NIL Technology Aps. During the
NIL process, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamps, which provided the
suitable flexibility, were prepared to achieve a soft release and
a successful replication. Apparently, the use of the PDMS stamps at
relatively high temperatures while maintaining the pressure at low
values allowed us to replicate hierarchical topographies in one step.
The nanocomposite substrate and the stamp were heated to 170 °C,
and a pressure of 5 bars was applied for 20 min. After cooling to
below 40 °C, the stamp and the biopolymer were separated.

4.7 Characterization of PLLA Nanocomposite Thin
Films before and after Patterning
The microstructure and
the surface morphology were observed using a field emission scanning
electron microscope (SEM) (FEI Quanta 650 FEG). A modern droplet shape
analysis instrument from Kruss was used to measure the wetting behavior
of our produced (micro- and/or nanostructured) surfaces. A water droplet
(smaller than the capillary length) was gently placed on the surface
using a needle, and its contact angle values were measured using the
sessile droplet method. A camera and a computer with commercial software
were used to measure the static contact angle after the needle was
removed.

The antibacterial activity of PLLA nanocomposite films,
before and after patterning, was evaluated according to ISO 207043:2007.
Bacterial strains of E. coli (BL21)
and S. aureus (ATCC 25923) were used
as the model Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, respectively.
Cells were grown in 100 mL of sterile nutrient broth (Luria-Bertani
broth) at 150 rpm and 37 °C. The cells were collected at the
logarithmic stage of growth, and the concentration of the suspensions
was adjusted to OD600 (optical density at 600 nm) value
of 0.5 in 25 mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Sigma) solution before
incubation with the nanostructured surface measuring 0.5 cm ×
0.5 cm in area. The as-received PLLA-coated Si wafer without nanostructures
of the same dimension was used as the control. In addition, a well
without a Si wafer served as an additional control. The nanostructured
and control surfaces were immersed in 1 mL of the bacterial suspension
in a 24-well plate. The growth of the adhered cells on the nanostructured
and control silicon surfaces was identified at different time intervals
of 6, 12, and 24 h by measuring the absorbance values at OD600 in triplicates. In addition, 100 μL of the cell suspensions
after 1 h of incubation with the nanostructured and control surfaces
was taken and diluted 10-folds. Each of the diluted suspensions was
spread onto three nutrient agar plates. Resulting colonies were then
counted after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, and the number of
colony-forming units per milliliter was calculated. To assess the
morphology of the adherent bacterial cells after 1 h, the nanostructured
and control surfaces were washed with fresh PBS and fixed with 2.5%
glutaraldehyde for 30 min. The samples were sputtered with gold before
imaging by SEM.42
