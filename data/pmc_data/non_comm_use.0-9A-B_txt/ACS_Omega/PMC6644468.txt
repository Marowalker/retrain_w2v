The corrosion of
steel substrates causes damage that is costly
to repair or replace. Current protective coatings predominately rely
on environmentally harmful anticorrosive agents and toxic solvents
to protect the underlying substrate. The use of lawsone (2-hydroxy-1,4-napthoquinone)
together with a water-based epoxy coating provides an environmentally
friendly alternative for common protective coatings. Microencapsulated
lawsone embedded in an epoxy coating allows the anticorrosive agent
to remain dormant until released by damage and delivered directly
onto the steel substrate. UV–vis analysis confirms successful
encapsulation of lawsone in a polyurethane shell wall and reveals
up to 8 wt % lawsone in the capsule cores. Uniform dry film thickness
and inflicted damaged are verified with ultrasound and optical microscopy.
Visual and electrochemical analysis demonstrates that this self-protective
scheme leads to a 70% corrosion inhibition efficiency in a neutral
salt water solution.

1 Introduction
The
steel used in bridges, automobiles, or pipelines is vulnerable
to corrosion damage unless protected from environmental exposure.
Protective coatings and corrosion inhibitors are used to prevent or
slow the damage that occurs because of corrosion and reduce the costs
associated with repair and replacement of damaged coatings and substrates.
Protective coatings rely on solvents and other compounds that contain
high volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Defined by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1970, VOCs are chemicals
released in the atmosphere that undergo photochemical reactions releasing
environmentally harmful peroxides and ozone, including those from
paints and coating applications.1 These
chemicals are binders, coalescing agents, plasticizers, freeze/thaw
stabilizers, defoamers, surfactants, and viscosity modifiers.2 During the drying and curing process, the release
of VOCs causes unpleasant odors, possible skin or eye irritation,
and allergic reactions.3 The coating material
used in this work contains water as the dispersing solvent with no
VOCs.

Corrosion inhibitors, used in combination with protective
coatings,
slow the corrosion process by inhibition of specific corrosion mechanisms.
Some common corrosion inhibition additives include zinc, phosphates,
and chromates.4−6 However, zinc and phosphates are harmful for humans
and the environment and chromates have been mostly banned because
of their carcinogenicity.7−9 The industry standard for incorporating
a corrosion inhibitor into a coating is by direct addition. Although
this approach is straightforward, the inhibitor may not be directly
exposed upon damage to the coating, potentially limiting its effectiveness.
Similarly, coating materials have been fabricated to have an intrinsic
anticorrosion or self-healing mechanism such as a sol–gel or
a water-activated polyelectrolyte coating.10,11 However, these coatings lack the structural integrity of other coating
materials (e.g., epoxy coatings).

Another approach to corrosion
inhibition is to encapsulate the
desired inhibitor and embed the container in the coating.12−16 Encapsulation provides protection of the inhibitor by preventing
uncontrollable release or undesired chemical reactions with the coating
material and has been shown to increase the corrosion protection of
the substrate when compared to directly adding the inhibitor into
the coating material.17,18 The inhibitor chemical agent
(e.g., anticorrosive, antibacterial, and self-healing) remains sequestered
and protected within the capsule until released by damage to the coating.
Modified nanoparticles are commonly employed to contain the anticorrosive
agent.17,19 Shchukin et al.18 applied polyelectrolyte layers to silica nanoparticles entrapping
the anticorrosive agent within the multiple layers. Upon corrosion
damage, the anticorrosive agent is released to prevent further corrosion.
Self-healing coatings can autonomously prevent corrosion by repairing
coating damage whenever and wherever it occurs.20,21 Some self-healing coatings use microencapsulated vegetable oils
and their derivatives as the healing agent.22−25 However, the timescale for repair
may be slow and the volume of the released healing agent may be insufficient
to fully prevent corrosion from proceeding. The vegetable oils are
drying oils and can require 24 h or more to repair coating damage.
Microcapsules with color and fluorescent indicators have also been
added to coatings for autonomous damage indication.26,27 However, the release of damage indicators alone does not repair
coating damage or prevent the corrosion process.

Here, we introduce
a self-protecting polymer coating with a microencapsulated
anticorrosion agent distributed throughout the coating. Lawsone (2-hydroxy-1,4-napthoquinone),
an extract of the henna plant, has known anticorrosive properties
based on the chelation of metal cations.28−33 The metal complexes formed (Figure 1) adsorb onto the underlying metal surface and form
a protective barrier. Lawsone is safe for humans and the environment
and is used for recreational tattoos and skin markings in medical
procedures.34,35 Lawsone has been previously incorporated
into a corrosive solution to provide corrosion protection of a substrate
but not encapsulated. Encapsulated lawsone in combination with a no
VOC water-based coating provides an environmentally friendly protective
coating for steel substrates. Lawsone must be encapsulated in this
self-protecting system because it is insoluble in the water-based
epoxy and forms large agglomerations. Corrosion analysis of this system
shows corrosion protection immediately after damage without the need
for a healing/drying time or external human intervention.

Figure 1 Lawsone structure
interacts with a metal ion (M) during the corrosion
process and forms a 1:1 or 2:1 metal complex where Z = 2 or 3.

The coating system is
schematically illustrated in Figure 2. Microcapsules containing
the green anticorrosive agent (lawsone and core solvent) are initially
embedded in a coating on a steel substrate. Upon mechanical damage
to the coating, the microcapsules are ruptured and the lawsone is
released into the damaged area where it forms a protective barrier
on top of the underlying steel substrate. An environmentally friendly
carrier solvent (hexyl acetate) is coencapsulated with lawsone to
provide a low viscosity, highly wetting solution that easily coats
the steel surface. The carrier solvent then evaporates or diffuses
away leaving behind a solid protective barrier of lawsone–metal
complexes. Other carrier solvents initially investigated are shown
in the Supporting Information. In this
paper, we demonstrate the anticorrosive effect of microcapsules containing
the anticorrosive agent lawsone in a water-based epoxy coating with
no VOCs.

embedded microcapsules containing an anticorrosive agent (e.g., lawsone).
(b) Mechanical damage ruptures embedded capsules releasing their content

solvent produces a solid protective barrier that passivates and protects

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Microcapsule
Characterization
Optical
(Figure 3a) and scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) cross section (Figure 3b) images of microcapsules were used to measure
the average capsule diameter (Figure 3c) and shell wall thickness (Figure 3d), respectively. SEM cross section images
were taken after the microcapsules were embedded in an epoxy (Epofix)
and freeze-fractured to view the capsule cross section. The average
capsule diameter was 30 ± 9.5 μm, and the measured shell
wall thickness was 510 ± 110 nm.

diameter as measured from optical images. (d) Capsule shell wall thickness

the shell interior (green), the shell wall (yellow), and the surrounding
epoxy (blue).

UV–vis was used
to measure the lawsone content of the extracted
capsule core (Figure 4) using the procedure outlined in the Supporting Information. As shown in Figure 4, the concentration of lawsone in the capsules plateaus
at a maximum value of 8%. This plateau is likely due to a concentration-dependent
nucleation of the solute (lawsone) as described by La Mer.36

Figure 4 Lawsone content of microcapsules as measured by UV–vis
analysis.
The dashed blue line represents the amount of lawsone initially added
into the encapsulation beaker and the amount of lawsone that would
be present inside the microcapsules if all of the lawsone was successfully
encapsulated.

Representative dynamic
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results
are shown in Figure 5. The microcapsules exhibit no appreciable weight loss before 200
°C, indicating good thermal stability. Degradation of the shell
wall material occurs thereafter followed by rapid weight loss. Notably,
the carrier solvent (hexyl acetate) evaporates well before 100 °C,
whereas type 0 capsules are stable until nearly 230 °C, indicating
successful encapsulation of the core material. The trace for neat
lawsone shows that a thermally stable residual mass exists above 400
°C. Comparing type 0 with the other microcapsule types, the residual
mass above 400 °C in types 2, 5, and 10 capsules confirms the
presence of lawsone in the core material.

Figure 5 TGA results of type 0,
2, 5, and 10 microcapsules along with pure
core materials.

Isothermal TGA traces
are shown in Figure 6a. The hexyl acetate-filled capsules lose
almost 50% of its mass in an isothermal analysis at 29 °C. This
environment is slightly above room temperature and has a constant
nitrogen flow allowing for quick evaporation of the hexyl acetate
core. Isothermal TGA of lawsone and the shell wall polyurethane (PU)
shows no mass loss in the TGA environment. From this we conclude that
the mass loss of the capsules near room temperature is due to the
loss of the inactive carrier solvent, hexyl acetate, and not the active
anticorrosive agent, lawsone. The TGA environment is not representative
of the actual storage conditions. The capsules are stored at room
temperature (22 °C) and in stagnant air or in a closed container.
The capsules stored in open containers at room temperature showed
a mass loss of 14% after 4 h and only 25% after 100 h (Figure 6b). Elevating the temperature
slightly (35 °C, coating cure temperature) shows a significantly
different response. The capsules lose 50% mass in the first 24 h and
almost 80% of their original mass after 100 h. However, the most representative
storage condition is in a closed storage container kept at room temperature.
In this case, after 100 h, the capsules lose less than 3% mass.

2.2 Anticorrosion
Coating Performance
2.2.1 Confirmation of Lawsone
Release
The release of lawsone from the capsules was confirmed
optically
using an opaque phenolic coating containing 20 wt % of type 10 capsules.
Control coatings with 20 wt % hexyl acetate capsules were also prepared. Figure 7 contains optical
images of the two coatings after damage. In Figure 7a, a distinctive orange color is observed
in the scribed region. In contrast, no color change is observed for
the control coatings (Figure 7b).

in an opaque phenolic coating. Optical images of (a) self-protecting
coating with lawsone-filled microcapsules. (b) Control coating with
hexyl acetate-filled microcapsules.

2.2.2 Observation of the Corrosion Product in
the Damage Zone
Anticorrosion performance of water-based
epoxy coatings containing lawsone capsules was evaluated through optical
imaging, SEM imaging, and electrochemical measurements. For these
studies, the damage induced by a corrocutter was kept as consistent
as possible across all coatings. A reconstructed image of the damage
created from a series of digital microscope images is shown in the Supporting Information. On average, the scribe
damage of water-based epoxy coating samples measured 82 ± 10
μm wide at the opening, 193 ± 17 μm deep from the
flat undamaged coating, and 3.8 cm long. Optical and SEM images were
taken of damaged samples after they were submerged in a 5 wt % NaCl
solution for 5 days (Figure 8). Figure 8a,c are images of a control coating with 20 wt % type 0 capsules,
and Figure 8b,d are
images of a self-protecting coating with 20 wt % type 10 microcapsules.
The optical images show that the corrosion product has not spread
as far in the self-protecting coating when compared to the control
coating. Similarly, there are significantly less corrosion product
crystals (Figure 8c
inset) seen in the SEM image of the self-protected coating. Because
of the similar color of the lawsone microcapsules and coating, the
optical images in Figure 8 have been enhanced by digitally subtracting out the background
color and adding a false color to the corrosion product image. Both
the original and color change images are shown in the Supporting Information.

product in coatings with lawsone capsules.

2.2.3 Electrochemical Characterization of Corrosion
Electrochemical (EC) analysis of damaged epoxy coatings was carried
out using the test cell in Figure 11. The average and one standard deviation of the EC
parameters, open-circuit potential (Eoc), corrosion current (Icorr), and inhibition
efficiency (IE %) are shown in Table 1 for samples containing 20 wt % of the five types of
microcapsules. The less negative open-circuit potential with an increasing
amount of lawsone in the microcapsules indicates an anodic-type inhibition.
Coating specimens with the lowest corrosion current (type 10 and 20
capsules) provide the best corrosion protection. An additional set
of experiments were carried out for coatings with 10 wt % of type
0 and type 10 capsules only. The corrosion current of coatings with
10 wt % type 10 capsules is summarized in Table 2. As expected, control coatings with type
0 capsules had similar properties regardless of capsule loading. Coatings
with 20 wt % type 10 capsules had a smaller corrosion current than
coatings with 10 wt % type 10 capsules, indicating that the corrosion
current depends on the amount of lawsone delivered.

Table 1 Corrosion Potential and Corrosion
Current of Coatings Containing 20 wt % of Various Types of Microcapsules
capsule type	Eoc (mV)	Icorr (μA)	IE % (%)	
type 0	–604 ± 15.1	0.83 ± 0.22	0 ± 21.9	
type 2	–585 ± 34.2	0.66 ± 0.06	20.4 ± 7.1	
type 5	–546 ± 8.60	0.44 ± 0.04	47.2 ± 5.0	
type 10	–545 ± 13.5	0.36 ± 0.03	55.9 ± 4.0	
type 20	–550 ± 3.80	0.33 ± 0.03	59.9 ± 3.4	
Table 2 Corrosion Potential and Corrosion
Current of Coatings Containing 10 wt % of Various Types of Microcapsules
capsule type	Eoc (mV)	Icorr (μA)	IE % (%)	
type 0	–600 ± 4.44	0.76 ± 0.17	0 ± 22.3	
type 10	–554 ± 13.0	0.52 ± 0.05	31.3 ± 6.9	
The corrosion current for all samples is plotted as a function
of lawsone loading in Figure 9. For all coatings, the corrosion current decreases with increasing
lawsone content in the microcapsules, resulting in less corrosion
of the substrate. Figure 10 summarized the inhibition efficiency (IE %) as calculated
by eq 1 of all of the
coatings. Maximum and minimum Io values
were used to calculate the IE % for the different sample types giving
the maximum and minimum possible range of IE % values. Coatings with
20 wt % loading of type 10 and 20 microcapsules had a similar lawsone
content and a similar anticorrosion performance. Both capsule types
had a maximum inhibition efficiency of almost 70%. The IE % of coatings
with 10% loading of type 10 capsules had almost half the IE % of coatings
with 20% loading of type 10 capsules. The amount of corrosion decreases
almost linearly with an increasing lawsone concentration within the
microcapsules. The amount of lawsone that can be encapsulated is a
limiting factor that prevents a better anticorrosion performance with
this protection scheme.

shown in Figure 9.

3 Conclusions
Self-protective water-based epoxy coatings were fabricated with
10 and 20 wt % microcapsules containing the henna plant extract lawsone
dissolved in a carrier solvent hexyl acetate. This coating system
is a safer and more environmentally benign alternative to current
anticorrosion coating systems used commonly in industry. The lawsone-filled
microcapsules also can be combined with a variety of other types of
materials where extra corrosion prevention is desired. Coatings with
lawsone capsules developed a significantly less corrosion product
in the damage region after exposure to 5 wt % NaCl solution. Increasing
the lawsone content in microcapsules led to a nearly linear reduction
in the corrosion current and increase in the inhibition efficiency
as measured by EC analysis. Coatings fabricated with 20 wt % capsules
containing the highest lawsone content of 8 wt % exhibited up to 70%
inhibition efficiency.

4 Experimental Methods
4.1 Materials
The microencapsulation
materials gum arabic, hexyl acetate, and lawsone were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) and were used as received. The
microcapsule shell wall material was prepared from a PU prepolymer
(Desmodur L 75) provided by Bayer MaterialScience. Hot rolled steel
substrates following ASTM A569 were purchased from Metals Depot (Winchester,
KY, USA). The epoxy coating consisted of Epirez resin 6520-WH-53 and
Epikure curing agent 6870-W-53 and were obtained from Chemical Marketing
Concepts Inc. Phenoline 187 phenolic resin was obtained from Carboline
(St. Louis, MO, USA).

4.2 Microcapsule Fabrication
The microencapsulation
procedure was modified from Mangun et al.37 The surfactant gum arabic (9 g) was slowly dissolved in 80 mL of
deionized (DI) water in a 400 mL beaker. The core solution consisting
of 40 g of hexyl acetate together with a range of concentrations of
lawsone was mixed with 5.0 g of the PU prepolymer (shell wall) in
a separate beaker. The core solution was then slowly added to the
water and surfactant solution while undergoing mechanical agitation
with a 51 mm diameter low shear mixing blade at 1200 rpm. Mixing was
allowed to continue for 2 h at 85 °C in a temperature-controlled
water bath. The resulting capsules were allowed to float in a separatory
funnel and rinsed in DI water until the solution was clear and free
of excess lawsone. The microcapsules were then freeze-dried to remove
all excess water. The naming convention and lawsone content of the
core solution for microcapsules that were fabricated for this study
are summarized in Table 3.

Table 3 Variation of Lawsone Content in Different
Microcapsule Types
designation	Lawsone concentration
of core solution (wt % wrt capsule
core)	
type 0	0	
type 2	2	
type 5	5	
type 10	10	
type 20	20	
4.3 Capsule
Core Analysis
The final lawsone
content of the encapsulated core material was determined by extracting
the core material and performing UV–vis spectroscopy (Shimadzu
2401-PC) of the sample as detailed in the Supporting Information. Using a calibration curve (Supporting Information Figure S2), the lawsone content can
be calculated from the measured peak absorbance of the extracted capsule
core material. TGA was performed on both microcapsules and isolated
core materials to determine thermal stability by heating to 650 °C
at a rate of 10 °C/min under nitrogen purge. Three isothermal
analyses were completed on capsules and components to determine capsule
stability under storage conditions. First, 24 h isothermal TGA was
completed near room temperature (29 °C) on capsules and capsule
components. Second, capsules were stored in an open container at room
temperature (22 °C) and at an elevated temperature (35 °C)
for 100 h and were weighed every 24 h. Last, capsules stored at room
temperature in a closed container were also weighed every 24 h to
more closely replicate storage conditions.

4.4 Coating
Preparation and Damage Protocol
Steel substrates measuring
30.5 by 10.0 by 0.5 cm were prepared
prior to the coating application. The substrates were sandblasted
to a “white metal blast” according to ASTM D7055-09
with 180 grit aluminum oxide blast media. They were cleaned with compressed
air to remove all excess grit, rinsed in acetone to remove dirt and
oils, and then let air-dry at room temperature. The water-based epoxy
coating was then applied with a micrometer-controlled doctor blade.
The epoxy coating mixture consisted of four components. The first
two were a stoichiometric mixture of Epirez resin 6520-WH-53 and Epikure
curing agent 6870-W-53 (weight ratio of 10:4). Both the resin and
curing agent are 53 wt % solids and 47 wt % water. To this mixture,
2 g of DI water was added for every 10 g of Epirez resin for viscosity
modification. The final component was 10 or 20 wt % microcapsules
with respect to the epoxy solid mass (resin and curing agent). The
coatings containing microcapsules with no lawsone (type 0) were prepared
as a control, and the self-protecting coatings with lawsone-filled
microcapsules contained up to 20 wt % lawsone. The applied coating
material was cured for 24 h at 35 °C. Fully cured and undamaged
coatings were optically imaged and analyzed with an EC analysis to
show the change in the barrier properties due to the addition of the
microcapsules. These results are detailed in the Supporting Information. The coatings were also damaged with
a corrocutter (Erichsen 639) affixed with a razor blade to inflict
uniform scribe damage to the coating. The scribe damage size was measured
with a digital microscope. After damage, the coatings were subjected
to ultrasonic, visual, and EC measurements to show the anticorrosion
performance of the lawsone-filled microcapsules.

Additional
specimens were prepared with a phenolic resin (Phenoline 187, made
by Carboline) for enhanced optical imaging. The manufacturer-suggested
mix ratio and cure time were used to prepare the phenolic coatings
with 20 wt % type 0 and type 10 microcapsules which were then applied
to steel substrates similar to the epoxy coating. The coatings were
damaged with a corrocutter and optically imaged to view the release
of lawsone. The release of lawsone was confirmed optically by its
orange color.

4.5 Ultrasonic Analysis of
Coating Thickness
An ultrasonic transmission analysis was
completed in pulse-echo
mode to measure the coating thickness. A custom transducer with a
frequency of 80 MHz and focal length of 1 cm was used. The sampling
frequency was 1 GHz, and the spot size of the transducer at the focal
point was 60 μm. The speed of sound within the coating material
was first determined (see Supporting Information). The speeds of sound of the epoxy coating and the microcapsule-embedded
epoxy coating were 2800 and 2600 m/s, respectively.

The samples
were placed in a water tank (degassed and DI) and the time difference
of the signal between the water/coating interface and the coating/steel
interface was measured. The thickness of the coating was then calculated
using the measured speed of sound of the coating material. A full
field thickness plot of the sample (see Supporting Information Figure S5) was acquired by x–y scanning of the transducer, and from these data, the average
thickness and standard deviation were calculated.

As a comparison,
coating samples were also cross-sectioned and
polished. The coating thickness was measured with a scanning electron
microscope in this case. The ultrasonic and SEM thickness measurements
were in good agreement (see Supporting Information). The thickness of the coatings used in this work had a cured thickness
of 120 ± 11.8 μm.

4.6 EC and Visual Characterization
The
EC analysis was completed in a specially designed test cell shown
schematically in Figure 11. The coated steel substrate was damaged
and then placed beneath the electrolyte chamber. The entire cell was
clamped to provide a sealed cell for analysis. A 5 wt % NaCl solution
was used as the electrolyte. The cell consists of three electrodes
with the steel substrate as the working electrode, a platinum wire
as the counter electrode (BASi MW-1032), and a silver/silver chloride
reference electrode (BASi MF-2052).

Figure 11 Electrochemical test cell with three
electrodes and a 5 wt % NaCl
electrolyte (75 mL). The steel samples measured 30.5 by 10.0 by 0.5
cm. The silicone seal was 0.5 cm thick. The electrolyte chamber measured
7.6 by 10 cm at the base and had a 4 cm diameter opening at the top.
The coated steel substrate acts as the working electrode, a platinum
wire (7.5 cm long, 0.5 mm diameter) serves as the counter electrode,
and a silver/silver chloride electrode (7.5 cm long, 6 mm diameter)
serves as the reference electrode.

Linear polarization measurements at room temperature (23
°C)
were performed with a Bio-Logic VSP potentiostat to measure the corrosion
current immediately after damage was introduced to the coating. The
open-circuit potential was first measured for 20 min; then, a stepwise
voltage from −100 to 100 mV at a rate of 0.2 mV/s was applied
with respect to the open-circuit voltage and the current measured
throughout. The EC analysis was completed on at least three samples
for each of the different types of microcapsules.

Tafel extrapolation
was used to determine the corrosion current
associated with steady-state corrosion. The corrosion current for
the control (Io) and self-protecting samples
(Ii) was measured and used to calculate
the inhibition efficiency (IE %)32,38 1  

The inhibition efficiency
provides a quantitative metric for cultivating
the performance of self-protecting coatings through the reduction
in corrosion current. The Tafel analysis was used as a tool to determine
the self-protecting capabilities of the coating and not to determine
the underlying corrosion mechanisms of lawsone as they are already
understood.28−30

A similar test cell was used for visual analysis,
except the top
of the electrolyte chamber was closed to prevent evaporation of the
electrolyte solution. The electrolyte solution (5 wt % NaCl in DI
water) was loaded into the cell immediately after damage, and the
samples were left submerged in the solution for 5 days. Submersion
visual tests were chosen to show the self-protection properties days
after damage was introduced to the coating as opposed to salt-fog
analysis that can simulate months of corrosion damage. Afterward,
both optical and SEM imaging was performed on the test samples. Because
of the similar color of the lawsone microcapsules and coating, some
of the optical images were enhanced by adding false color to the corrosion
product after digitally subtracting out the background color.
