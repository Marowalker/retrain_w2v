Noble metal nanoparticles
(NPs) have been widely applied in nanocatalysis
owing to the benefits associated with their miniature size. However,
improving their stability and reusability during catalytic applications
still remains a great challenge. To this end, monodispersed gold@void@polyaniline
yolk–shell nanocomposites (Au@void@PANI YSNs) were synthesized
using bottom-up template-assisted methods. Au@SiO2 NPs,
prepared from a modified sol–gel process, were used as templates
for the thiol–ene click reaction with 4-vinylaniline (VAn)
to immobilize the aniline moieties, which later performed as the initiation
sites for the oxidative copolymerization of aniline from the outer
surface of the Au@SiO2–VAn NPs with an electroactive
PANI shell (Au@SiO2@PANI NPs). The silica layer sandwiched
between the Au core and PANI shell was selectively removed by aqueous
hydrofluoric acid to produce Au@void@PANI YSNs with a movable Au core.
The electroactive PANI shell not only serves as a physical barrier
that prevents the self-association of Au cores and provides a vacant
cavity where chemical transformations take place on the Au cores in
a controlled manner but also improves the activity and stability of
Au cores due to the electrons delocalization and transfer from the
Au d orbitals of the nanocores to the π-conjugated ligands of
the PANI shell, as proved by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
results. The as-synthesized YSNs were found to perform as flexible
and reusable heterogeneous catalysts with high catalytic efficiency
for the aerobic oxidation of alcohol in aqueous solution. One may
find the present study to be a general and effective way to fabricate
monodispersed hollow nanomaterials in a controlled and green manner.

1 Introduction
Noble metal nanoparticles
(NPs) on solid supports have been recognized
as promising catalysts in various fields, including the fine chemicals
industry and environmental protection.1−10 However, NPs with their miniature size usually undergo sintering
or self-association during the catalytic reaction, leading to undesirable
destruction of the active surface area for catalysis. In addition,
the stability and reusability of NPs still remain a great challenge
upon usage.11−14 To this end, sophisticated nanostructures were fabricated with a
hollow cavity, in “yolk–shell” or “rattle-type”
nanostructures, to create individualized nanoreactors around the catalytically
active nanocores.15−22 These catalytic nanoreactors have several advantages in comparison
with the conventional catalysts embedded in solid supports. Encapsulation
of an individual nanocore into a solid but permeable shell creates
a relatively homogeneous atmosphere and effectively prevents the functional
nanocore from sintering or self-aggregation even under harsh reaction
conditions. Furthermore, the interaction of catalytically active cores
with the outer shells is more effective than that in the bulk form,
leading to higher catalytic activity.

Among the various conducting
polymers, polyaniline (PANI) has been
of particular interest owing to its comparatively low cost, excellent
chemical and thermal stabilities, tunable electrical conductivity,
and interconvertible intrinsic redox states.23−25 These properties
have enabled a broad spectrum of applications, including in the areas
of batteries, catalysts, sensors, actuators, antistatic coating, corrosion
protection of metal, biocompatible materials, electrochromic devices,
and light-emitting devices.26−31 In light of the strong interaction between the amine groups and
noble metal atoms on the surface of NPs, PANI, consisting of benzene
rings and amine groups within the same repeat unit, will be an ideal
stabilizer for noble metal cores. Control over the size of NPs with
the catalytically active core, PANI polymer shell, and free space
in between is still lacking but is of crucial importance for their
applications as nanocatalysts.

In the present paper, we report
a flexible, scalable, and robust
template-assisted approach for the fabrication of yolk–shell
nanocomposites (YSNs), encapsulating a movable Au core in the vacant
space of an electroactive polymer shell (Au@void@PANI YSNs). The synthesis
procedure consists of three major steps, as shown in Scheme 1. The most straightforward
approach for the synthesis of YSNs is the template-assisted approach,
where the core and two concentric shells with distinct chemical compositions
are constructed from inside to outside in sequence, followed by selective
removal of the template layer by dissolution or thermal decomposition.
By carefully selecting the shell compositions, this approach could
be extended to the fabrication of various kinds of hollow or yolk–shell
nanomaterials.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Au and
Au@SiO2–MTS Core–Shell
NPs
Procedures for the template-assisted synthesis of monodispersed
YSNs, comprising a gold core and an electroactive PANI shell (Au@void@PANI
YSNs), are illustrated in Scheme 1. Common methods to fabricate YSNs involve soft template
and template-free methods, Ostwald ripening and self-aggregation methods,
and methods based on the galvanic replacement or the Kirkendall effect.15−22,32 These methods often require the
use of highly toxic reagents (e.g., KCN), are restrained to specific
nanostructures, and remain a great challenge to controlling the size
and size distribution of the resultant NPs.15−22,32 An alternative method is selective
etching of a sacrificial layer of core–double shell NPs. The
template-assisted methods have proved to be general and effective
methods for the synthesis of monodispersed hollow nanomaterials with
a sophisticated structure, especially for the inorganic-polymer YSNs,
in spite of their tedious synthetic processes.

Precise control
over the size, shape, and size/shape distribution of nanocores is
the prerequisite to developing monodispersed YSNs. Despite being an
environmentally benign process and its ease of regulating the size
of Au NPs, the Turkevich method usually suffers from a broad and undesirable
size/shape distribution.33,34 This issue can be overcome
by the rapid injection of a mixture of HAuCl4 (gold precursor),
trisodium citrate (Na3Cit), and a trace amount of AgNO3 into boiling water.33 For the
Turkevich method, the use of a Na3Cit/HAuCl4 feed molar ratio of 3.5:1 produces Au NPs with a minimal size.33,34 The Au NPs with an average diameter of 13 nm were obtained from
the use of a Na3Cit/HAuCl4 molar ratio of 3.5:1,
as confirmed by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image in Figure 1a. This approach
effectively supplements the classical Turkevich method in terms of
reproducibility and uniformity of the NP size and shape.

Au@void@PANI-2 yolk–shell, and (f) Au@void@PANI-1 yolk–shell
nanoparticles. All scale bars are 100 nm.

The thiol groups on the surface of Au@SiO2–MTS
NPs will perform as coupling anchors for the surface-initiated thiol–ene
click reaction for the introduction of aniline moieties.36−42 The absorbance of amphiphilic poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) stabilizers
onto Au surfaces provides sufficient affinity for silica coatings
on the single Au core. The respective TEM images of the so-obtained
Au@SiO2–MTS NPs with two distinctive SiO2–MTS shell thicknesses of about 19 and 24 nm are shown in Figure 1b,c, respectively.
For each type of NP, a narrowly distributed and smooth concentric
silica shell of lower image contrast encircling the Au core is clearly
displayed. The silica shell thickness can be tuned by varying the
tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) feed volume. The average size, size
distribution, and corresponding shell thickness of the Au@SiO2–MTS NPs are calculated and summarized in Table 1. The X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) wide-scan spectrum of the Au@SiO2–MTS-2
NPs is shown in Figure 2a. The dense and thick coverage of the SiO2–MTS
shell on the Au@SiO2–MTS-2 NPs resulted in the signal
eclipse of the underlying elements [Au 4f signal with a binding energy
(BE) of ∼84 eV] in the XPS wide-scan spectrum.43,44

2.2 Au@void@PANI
YSNs
Introduction of
aniline moieties onto the outer surface of the core–shell NPs
allowed the subsequent fabrication of electroactive PANI outer shells
via oxidative graft polymerization. Because of the incompatibility
of aniline moieties with the radical polymerization and conventional
coupling reaction, the use of a thiol–ene click reaction has
recently attracted considerable interest and has been adopted as a
complementary method for the synthesis of polymer nanocomposites.45−48 Thiol–ene click reactions proceed under mild reaction conditions
with high efficiency and fast kinetics.49 4-Vinylaniline (VAn) reacted with the thiol groups of the SiO2–MTS shell and was consequently clicked onto the shell
surface (Scheme 1).
The presence of a nitrogen signal in the XPS wide-scan spectrum of
Au@SiO2–VAn NPs indicated that VAn had been successfully
clicked onto the silica templates (Figure 2b).42−44

The aniline moieties on
the Au@SiO2–VAn NPs can act as the anchoring and
initiation sites for the surface-initiated oxidative polymerization
of aniline in the presence of ammonium persulfate (APS) as the oxidant
(Scheme 1).50 The TEM image of Au@SiO2@PANI-2 NPs
in Figure 1d reveals
a core–double shell hybrid nanoarchitecture with two concentric
shells of distinctive image contrasts encircling the Au cores. With
the increase in aniline feed volumes from 50 to 200 μL, the
PANI shell thickness of the core–double shell NPs increases
correspondingly from 7 to 29 nm, as shown in Table 1.

Removal of the silica sacrificial
layer of the Au@SiO2@PANI core–double shell NPs
by hydrofluoric acid (HF) etching
resulted in the formation of HF-doped Au@void@PANI YSNs. Unlike in
strong bases,
the etching process of the silica layer by HF usually proceeds with
high efficiency, fast kinetics, and formation of products with high
water solubility. Excess HF was used to ensure total corrosion of
the silica template layer. The YSN nanostructure with a hollow shell
enclosing a movable metal core is clearly displayed in Figure 1e,f. The PANI shell with a
thickness of 16 nm provides sufficient strength to sustain the hollow
cavity (Figure 1e).
Decrease in the thickness of the PANI shell to around 7 nm will lead
to the deformation of hollow nanostructures, as shown in Figure 1f. The distinct Au
4f signal in the wide-scan spectrum of Au@void@PANI-1 YSNs suggests
that the PANI shell thickness is comparable to the 8 nm probing depth
of the XPS technique in organic matrices (Figure 2c).43,44 The electrons delocalization
and transfer from the Au d orbitals to the π-conjugated ligands
of the PANI shell have resulted in the shift of a normal Au 4f7/2 signal with a BE of 84.0 eV to a higher BE of 84.8 eV,
as shown in Figure 2d. The interaction between the Au core and PANI shell can effectively
stabilize the Au nanocores, making it difficult to lose additional
electrons. Figure 2e–g describes the respective N 1s core-level spectra of the
Au@void@PANI-1 YSNs in their neutral emeraldine (EM) base form, HF-protonated
form, and fully reduced leucoemeraldine (LM) base form, respectively.
The curve-fitted XPS N 1s core-level line shape of the Au@void@PANI-1
YSNs comprises two peak components with BEs at 398.2 and 399.4 eV
for the respective quinonoid imine (=N−)
and benzenoid amine (−NH−) units of
the grafted PANI shell in their EM base form (Figure 2e).23,42−44,50,51 Protonation of the PANI shell by HF preferentially leads to the
conversion of the =N– species to a
comparable amount of the N+ species (Figure 2f).23,42,50,51 The predominance of C–N peak intensity at
the BE of about 399.4 eV in Figure 2g is attributable to the conversion of PANI shells
to the fully reduced LM state.

Figure 3 exhibits
the respective thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves of the PANI
homopolymers (curve a) and Au@void@PANI YSNs (curve b). The gross
weight loss occurring at around 400 °C is associated with the
thermal degradation of the PANI shells. On the basis of the weight
remaining at 900 °C of these two samples, the weight content
of Au nanocores in the Au@void@PANI YSNs is about 14 wt %.

2.3 Application
of the Au@void@PANI YSNs in Aerobic
Catalytic Oxidation of Alcohol
As a typical set of organic
reactions in the fine chemicals industry, the chemical transformation
of alcohols to aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids usually requires
stoichiometric consumption of toxic or corrosive substances, such
as heavy metal ions in high oxidation states.3,52,53 The overoxidation and leakage of Au NPs
during the catalytic applications largely promote the development
of stable and reusable Au nanocatalysts for the chemical transformation
of alcohols under mild conditions.54,55 In the present
work, aerobic oxidation of 1-phenylethanol catalyzed by the Au@void@PANI
YSNs in an aqueous solution and at room temperature was carried out
(Scheme 2). The conversion
reaches 90% at around 6 h and eventually exceeds 95% when the reaction
time is prolonged to 24 h, as can be seen from the time course of
the ketone yield in Figure 4A. The strong binding between the π-conjugated ligands
in PANI shells and the Au NPs renders a more effective and comprehensive
contact of reactants with Au cores. In addition, the catalytic YSNs
can be facilely recycled by centrifugation and reused without significant
loss of reactivity (yield loss within 2% after eight successive cycles;
inset of Figure 4A).
It has been reported that Au NPs are capable of activating O2 at the solid–liquid interface during the aerobic oxidation
of alcohol in an aqueous solution.56 The
PANI shells prevent the Au NPs from self-aggregation. No catalytic
reduction of 1-phenylethanol was observed in the absence of YSNs.
The stability of the YSNs is one of the most essential criteria governing
their practical applications. The TEM image clearly displays the well-preserved
rattle-type nanostructure with a hollow shell encircling a movable
core, as shown in Figure 4B. The average diameter of the Au nanocores, as measured and
calculated from Figure 4B, is about 13 nm, which is consistent with that obtained before
the aerobic oxidation (Table 1). The inductively coupled plasma method also indicated that
there was no conversion or leakage of the Au cores in the YSNs to
the reaction solution during the catalytic applications. Thus, the
synthesized YSNs can serve as a spatially confined reusable nanoreactor
for catalytic applications.

3 Conclusions
Monodispersed Au@void@PANI
YSNs, comprising a movable gold nanocore
and an electroactive PANI shell, have been fabricated by selective
removal of the silica template layer of Au@SiO2@PANI core–double
shell NPs obtained from the combined sol–gel process, thiol–ene
click reaction, and oxidative graft copolymerization. The Au@void@PANI
YSNs exhibit desirable catalytic efficiency upon the usage of the
aerobic oxidation of alcohols in an aqueous solution at room temperature.
Moreover, it can be facilely recycled from the reaction residue by
centrifugation. The improved activity and stability have resulted
from the unique YSN nanostructure, in which electrons delocalize and
transfer from
Au d orbitals of the nanocores to the π-conjugated ligands of
the PANI shell. Thus, the stable PANI shell protects the Au cores
from self-aggregation. The versatile synthesis protocol for the YSNs
of the present study opens up the possibility of designing a broad
range of noble metal NPs encapsulated in an electroactive polymer
shell. The YSNs can be used as a new class of nanoreactors for heterogeneous
catalytic applications in a robust, confined, and controlled environment.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
TEOS
(98%), (3-mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane
(MTS, 95%), 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone (DMPA, 99%), VAn (97%),
APS ((NH4)2S2O8, ≥98%),
aniline (≥99.5%), PVP (Mw = 10 000
g/mol), and 1-phenylethanol (98%) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
Chem. Co. and used as received without further purification. Ammonium
hydroxide solution (13.2 M), ethyl acetate (HPLC grade), hydrochloric
acid (HCl, 37 wt %), potassium bicarbonate (K2CO3, ≥99%), HF (48 wt %), and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone
(NMP, reagent grade) were obtained from Merck Chem. Co. and used as
received without further purification. PANI was obtained according
to the methods reported in the literature.23,24 All glassware and stirring bars were cleaned with aqua regia, consisting
of 37 wt % hydrochloric acid (75 vol %) and 65 wt % nitric acid (25
vol %), and then rinsed thoroughly with ultrapure water before use.

4.2 Synthesis of the Au@SiO2–MTS
Core–Shell NPs via a Sol–Gel Reaction
Preparation
of monodispersed quasi-spherical gold NPs (Au NPs) was carried out
using procedures reported earlier.33−35 About 20 mg of Au NPs
with an average diameter of 13 nm were stabilized by PVP (Mw = 10 000 g/mol), concentrated, and
stored in 40 mL of ultrapure water.

The incorporation of a silica
template layer on the PVP-stabilized Au NPs was performed via the
sol–gel reaction with TEOS. In a typical synthetic procedure,
the above-mentioned Au NP aqueous solution was mixed with ethanol
(160 mL) and ammonium hydroxide solution (13.2 M, 5 mL), with the
aid of sonication for 30 min. About 0.2 mL (0.9 mmol) of TEOS was
added dropwise to the reaction mixture under vigorous stirring. The
reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 24 h. After
the reaction, the Au@SiO2 NPs were isolated by centrifugation
and purified by three cycles of redispersion/washing/centrifugation
in a mixture of ethanol and water of equal volume ratio. The purified
Au@SiO2 NPs were dried under reduced pressure for future
use.

About 30 mg of Au@SiO2 NPs were dispersed into
a mixture
of ethanol (80 mL), water (20 mL), and ammonium hydroxide solution
(13.2 M, 2.5 mL). The reaction mixture was sonicated for 30 min. About
0.3 mL of MTS (1.26 mmol) was introduced dropwise into the mixture
before sealing the flask in an argon atmosphere. The reaction mixture
was stirred vigorously over a reaction period of 24 h, to introduce
the thiol groups onto the surface of silica templates. After the reaction,
the Au@SiO2–MTS NPs were isolated by centrifugation
and purified by three cycles of redispersion/washing/centrifugation
in a water and ethanol mixture of equal volume ratio. The purified
NPs were dried in a vacuum oven at room temperature for 24 h. The
involvement of initial TEOS volumes of 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 mL in sequence
in the sol–gel reaction produces Au@SiO2–MTS
core–shell NPs with shell thicknesses of 19, 24, and 30 nm,
respectively.

4.3 Synthesis of the Au@SiO2@PANI Core–Double
Shell NPs via the Oxidative Graft Polymerization
In a typical
thiol–ene click reaction, about 35 mg of Au@SiO2–MTS NPs were dispersed into 30 mL of ethanol with the aid
of sonication for 15 min. DMPA (246 mg, 1.77 mmol) and VAn (200 μL,
1.77 mmol) were then introduced into the mixture. The mixture was
stirred and degassed with purified argon stream for 20 min, sealed,
and subjected to UV irradiation for 1 h. The Au@SiO2–VAn
NPs were extracted thrice with ethanol to dissolve bound reactants.
The Au@SiO2–VAn NPs were dried under reduced pressure
for future use.

About 25 mg of the Au@SiO2–VAn
core–shell NPs and 100 μL (1.1 mmol) of aniline were
added to 10 mL of 1 M HCl under vigorous stirring. About 250 mg (1.1
mmol) of APS was dissolved in 2 mL of 1 M HCl and introduced dropwise
into the reaction mixture at 0 °C. The oxidative graft copolymerization
was allowed to proceed under stirring for 8 h. The use of excess NaOH
(1 M) renders the conversion of the PANI shell to the neutral EM base
form. The resulting Au@SiO2@PANI NPs were isolated by centrifugation
and purified by three cycles of redispersion/washing/centrifugation
in NMP to dissolve the adsorbed oligomers and homopolymers. The purified
Au@SiO2@PANI NPs were dried under reduced pressure until
a constant weight was obtained. Au@SiO2@PANI core–double
shell NPs of 7, 16, and 29 nm in PANI shell thickness were synthesized
via oxidative graft polymerization using initial aniline feed volumes
of 50, 100, and 200 μL, respectively.

4.4 Preparation
of the Au@void@PANI YSNs by HF
Etching
Au@void@PANI YSNs were prepared by selective etching
of the silica sacrificial layer from the Au@SiO2@PANI NPs
by HF corrosion. About 40 mg of Au@SiO2@PANI NPs were introduced
into 10 mL of HF (24 wt %). The reaction was allowed to proceed under
stirring at room temperature for 12 h. The YSNs were separated by
centrifugation and dialyzed in ultrapure water for one week to remove
the excess HF and SiF4. Finally, the Au@void@PANI YSNs
were recovered via lyophilization. Interconversion of the protonated
PANI shells to the EM base by reaction with a strong base (e.g., NaOH)
and subsequent EM base to fully reduced LM base by reaction with reducing
agents (e.g., hydrazine) was carried out according to the methods
reported in the literature with a slight modification.23,42,50

4.5 Catalytic
Aerobic Oxidation of Alcohol
Aerobic oxidation of alcohol
is catalyzed by Au NPs in an aqueous
solution.3,56 For the aerobic catalytic oxidation of alcohol
using the Au@void@PANI YSNs, 1-phenylethanol (12.2 mg, 0.1 mmol) and
K2CO3 (41.4 mg, 0.3 mmol) in ultrapure water
(5 mL) were introduced into a 25 mL reaction flask. The Au@void@PANI
YSN suspension (1 mL, 10 mg/mL) was added to the solution. The aerobic
oxidation was carried out under stirring at 25 °C. The reaction
mixture (6 mL) was taken out at fixed periods, diluted with 1 mL of
1 M HCl, and extracted three times with ethyl acetate (5 mL). After
being dried over magnesium sulfate, the combined organic layer was
collected by filtration and diluted with ethyl acetate to about 30
mL in total. The product was studied by gas chromatography (GC, Agilent,
7890A-5975C, USA), and the reaction yield was obtained from the calibration
curve.

4.6 Materials Characterization
The morphology
of the NPs was studied by a field emission TEM (JEOL JEM-2100F). Surface
compositions of the NPs were determined by XPS measurements on a Kratos
AXIS Ultra DLD spectrometer equipped with a monochromatized Al Kα
X-ray source (1468.71 eV photons). Thermal stability of the YSNs was
analyzed by TGA. Each sample was heated from 25 °C to about 900
°C, with a heating rate of 10 °C/min, in a dry nitrogen
atmosphere in a Shimadzu DTG-60AH TGA-DTA Analyzer.

The polydispersity
index (PDI) of the NPs was determined by57  where Dn denotes
the number-average diameter, Dw denotes
the weight-average diameter, and Di denotes the measured diameter of the NPs. The average diameter
of each sample was calculated based on the Di of random selection of at least 100 NPs
in the TEM images. Coefficient of variation (CV) denoted as the ratio
of standard deviation (δ) to the mean (Dn), or CV = δ/Dn, was introduced
to estimate the error in the NP size.
