Spin-crossover
(SCO) is a reversible transition between low and
high spin states by external stimuli such as heat. The SCO behavior
and transition temperature (T1/2) of a
series of [FeII(X-pybox)2](ClO4)2 were studied to establish a methodology for ligand-field
engineering, where X-pybox stands for 2,6-bis(oxazolin-2-yl)pyridine
substituted with X at the 4-position of the pyridine ring. We utilized
X = MeO, Me, 3-thienyl, Ph, H, MeS, 2-thienyl, N3, Cl,
Br, 3-pyridyl, and 4-pyridyl. The solution susceptometry on five new
derivatives with X = Me, 2-thienyl, N3, Br, and 3-pyridyl
was performed in acetone, giving the SCO temperatures of 220, 260,
215, 280, and 270 K, respectively. The density-functional-theory molecular
orbital (MO) calculation was performed on the ligands with geometry
optimization. The atomic charge on the pyridine nitrogen atom [ρ(Npy)] was extracted from the natural orbital population analysis.
Positive correlation appeared in the T1/2 versus ρ(Npy) plot with R2 = 0.734, being consistent with the analysis using the Hammett
substituent constants (σp and σp+). This finding
well agrees with the mechanism proposed: the rich electron density
lifts the t2g energy level through the dπ–pπ
interaction, resulting in a narrow t2g–eg energy gap and favoring the high-spin state and low T1/2. The MO method was successfully applied to the known
SCO-active iron(II) compounds involving 4-substituted 2,6-bis(pyrazol-1-yl)pyridines.
A distinct positive correlation appeared in the T1/2 versus ρ(Npy) plot. The comparison
of correlation coefficients indicates that ρ(Npy)
is a more reliable parameter than σp or σp+ to predict a shift
of T1/2. Furthermore, this method can
be more generalized by application to another known SCO family having
3-azinyl-4-p-tolyl-5-phenyl-1,2,4-triazole ligand
series, where azinyl stands for a 2-azaaromatic ring. A good linear
correlation was found in the T1/2 versus
ρ(NA) plot (NA is the ligating nitrogen
atom in the azaaromatic ring). Finally, we will state a reason why
the present treatment is competent to predict the SCO equilibrium
position only by consideration on the electronic perturbation.

Introduction
Spin-crossover (SCO)
is a reversible transition between low-spin
(LS) and high-spin (HS) states associated with external stimuli such
as heat, light, and pressure.1−4 Iron(II) (3d6) coordination compounds
are important SCO systems because SCO occurs between S = 0 dia- and S = 2 paramagnetic states, where a
drastic magnetic change is expected. The six-nitrogen donor structures
(i.e., FeIIN6) have been studied most extensively,5−10 and in particular, meridional triimine-type ligands are frequently
applied for this purpose. The analogy between the well-established
SCO ligands 2,6-bis(pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine (1-bpp;11 for the structural formula, see Scheme 1) and 2,6-bis(pyrazol-3-yl)pyridine (3-bpp)12 gives us a clue to the development of novel
robust SCO ligands and furthermore a guide to the ligand-field engineering.
We have developed the triimine ligand 2,6-bis(oxazolin-2-yl)pyridine
(pybox) and its derivatives after the pioneering works by the Gao13,14 and Halcrow groups.15

Scheme 1 Structural Formulas
of 1-bpp, 3-bpp, Pybox, and Lazinyl (* = CH or N)
The physical properties should
be predicted and controlled in a
nonserendipitous manner. The SCO behavior and transition temperature
of a series of [FeII(X-pybox)2](ClO4)2 were studied in connection to the substituent effect,
where pybox is substituted with X at the 4-position of the pyridine
ring. The introduction of substituents will bring about drastic SCO
tuning through the covalent bonds, in comparison with the effects
through intermolecular interaction from counter ions and/or solvent
molecules incorporated. A part of the experimental data has been communicated
and clarified to undergo near-room-temperature SCO with X = H, Cl,
Ph, CH3O, CH3S,16 3-thienyl (3Th), and 4-pyridyl (4Py).17 The magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed in solution
to purge intermolecular interactions and rigid crystal lattice effects,
and discussion can be focused on the substituent effect. A plot of T1/2 against the Hammett substituent constant
σp18,19 exhibited a strong correlation
with a positive slope, indicating that electron-donating (-releasing)
groups suppress T1/2 in this series. Here,
the SCO temperature T1/2 is defined as
the temperature at which equimolar fractions of the HS and LS species
are present.

Five compounds with X = Me, 2-thienyl (2Th), N3, Br,
and 3-pyridyl (3Py) are newly synthesized, and the SCO properties
are investigated in the present work. Discussion will cover a wide
range of the substituent effect in a T1/2 versus σp plot, after the known data16,17 were superposed on the same plot (12 data points in total). As a
main subject in this work, we planned to predict T1/2 by an aid of molecular orbital (MO) calculation. The
atomic charge from population analysis at the pyridine nitrogen atom
is assumed to be the most important for the crystal field. In this
line, the MO calculation method seems to be versatile because it requires
the chemical formula only. The experimental and calculation results
are combined and discussed in connection with a plausible mechanism.

Finally, the MO calculation method will be justified by applying
to the known SCO system, [FeII(X-1-bpp)2](BF4)2 with 4-X-substituted 1-bpp.11 In addition, this method can be more generalized by applying
to another known SCO family [FeII(Lazinyl)2(NCBH3)2] having 3-azinyl-5-phenyl-4-p-tolyl-1,2,4-triazole ligand series,20 where azinyl stands for a 2-azaaromatic ring. We will make
a comment on what method and metrics are recommended to predict T1/2 and a reason why the present treatment is
competent to predict the SCO equilibrium position only by consideration
on the electronic perturbation from the ligating atom.

Results
Preparation
and Crystal Structure Analysis
Applying
a wide variety of the substituents is an important ingredient for
the purpose of proposing a magnetostructure relationship. A simple
alkyl group Me was chosen as an electron-donating group and a bromine
atom as an electron-withdrawing (-accepting) group. An azide group
is selected as an example of a heteroatom substituent, and 2-thienyl
and 3-pyridyl groups are selected as aromatic substituents. Known
ligands Me-pybox21,22 and Br-pybox23 were prepared according to the literature method. New ligands
N3-, 2Th-, and 3Py-pybox were prepared according to the
established procedures23−27 using a common intermediate Cl-pybox26 via aromatic nucleophilic substitution reactions. The Suzuki coupling28 was applied to heteroaromatic coupling in the
preparation of 2Th- and 3Py-pybox (Scheme 2a).

X-pybox
stands for 4-X-2,6-bis(oxazolin-2-yl)pyridine
with X = MeO, Me, 3-thienyl (3Th), Ph, H, MeS, 2-thienyl (2Th), N3, Cl, Br, 3-pyridyl (3Py), 4-pyridyl (4Py).

According to the known method,13−17 the complex formation from X-pybox and Fe(ClO4)2·6H2O was conducted in methanol
(Scheme 2b). New complexes
[Fe(X-pybox)2](ClO4)2 (X = Me, 2Th,
N3, Br, 3Py) were synthesized and purified to give polycrystalline
products. The elemental and spectroscopic analyses satisfied the target
formula with solvation. As for the X = Me and 2Th derivatives, the
X-ray diffraction study clarified the cell parameters (see the Experimental Section).

The crystal structures
were successfully determined for [Fe(X-pybox)2](ClO4)2 (X = N3, Br, 3Py)
at 100 K (Figure 1).
Selected crystallographic parameters are listed in Table 1. The crystals involve solvated
methanol molecules. Compound [Fe(N3-pybox)2](ClO4)2·0.75MeOH crystallizes in a space group
triclinic P1̅, and there are two crystallographically
independent molecules in a unit cell with Z = 4.
They are quite similar to each other except for the bending directions
of the terminal N3 groups (Figure 1a,b). Regardless of the peripheral substituents,
the double meridional motif is formed, affording an FeN6 coordination sphere. The Fe–N bond lengths (1.97 and 1.95
Å) on the average indicate that both molecules are assigned to
an LS state at 100 K (Table 2).

a There are two crystallographically
independent molecules.

The
space group of the crystal of [Fe(Br-pybox)2](ClO4)2·MeOH is triclinic P1̅
with Z = 2, and one whole molecule is crystallographically
independent. One methanol molecule is involved in the crystal. The
Fe–N bond length (1.95 Å) indicates the LS state at 100
K.a There is a pseudo-polymorph, [Fe(Br-pybox)2](ClO4)2·3MeOH (see the Experimental Section). A crystal was manually picked
up under a microscope, but selective crystallization was unsuccessful
at present. This morph did not undergo SCO, so that the magnetic data
must be analyzed with this finding taken into account. On the other
hand, the solution experiments are not disturbed by the presence of
the polymorph.

Compound [Fe(3Py-pybox)2](ClO4)2·2MeOH crystallizes in an orthorhombic P212121 space group. The
Flack parameter
was well reduced. There is a unique crystallographically independent
molecule in a unit cell and Z = 4. The Fe–N
bond lengths varying in ca. 1.90–1.98 Å suggest the LS
state at 100 K. The pyridine nitrogen position does not show any disorder
because the presence of hydrogen bonds between the pyridine nitrogen
atoms and the hydroxyl groups from methanol molecules solvated (the
Npyridyl···OMeOH distances are
2.820(6) Å for N4pyridyl···O13MeOH and 2.884(5) Å for N8pyridyl···O14MeOH).b

Magnetic Properties in
the Solid State
The present
compounds have a potential of SCO near room temperature, which has
been confirmed by means of the SQUID magnetic susceptometry. Because
the three derivatives (X = N3, Br, and 3Py) have structurally
been characterized, their polycrystalline magnetic properties are
reported here. As Figure 2a shows, the high-temperature limits of the χmT value were 3.0–4.5 cm3 K mol–1, typical of the S = 2 HS state of
the iron(II) ion. The LS state is characterized with 0 cm3 K mol–1. For all the compounds investigated here,
the χmT profiles on heating were
not reproduced by those of the cooling process. This finding is rationalized
by the presence of a crystal solvent molecule, which is assumed to
escape during the heating measurements up to 400 K.

Figure 2 (a) Temperature dependence
of χmT for solid specimens [Fe(N3-pybox)2](ClO4)2·0.75MeOH,
[Fe(Br-pybox)2](ClO4)2·MeOH,
and [Fe(3Py-pybox)2](ClO4)2·2MeOH.
(b) Temperature dependence of the
HS molar fraction, γHS, in acetone solution of [Fe(X-pybox)2](ClO4)2 (X = Me, 2Th, N3, Br, 3Py).

The χmT value of the N3 derivative is practically
null below 150 K (Figure 2a), but above 320 K, it reached the HS level,
indicating that this specimen underwent SCO. The heating process showed
a two-step profile, which is in good agreement with the presence of
two crystallographically independent molecules. The SCO temperatures
were ca. 220 K for the first gradual SCO and 330 K for the second
abrupt SCO. On cooling from 400 K, the SCO behavior took place in
a single step and broad manner. The high-temperature χmT value of the Br derivative is practically saturated
to reach a half level of the theoretical HS value. A possible reason
for this behavior is the coexistence of polymorphic crystals of LS,
as clarified by the crystallographic analysis. Owing to the crystal
breakdown, details are unknown in the high-temperature phase. A relatively
abrupt χmT jump was recorded at
310 K on heating. The measurements on cooling almost maintained the
room-temperature χmT value. The
3Py derivative exhibited an abrupt χmT jump at 340 K on heating and an incomplete decrease on cooling.

The SCO temperatures in the heating process has been recorded as T1/2(N3) < T1/2(Br) < T1/2(3Py). The electron-withdrawing
character has the same order in the σp scale:18,19 σp(N3) < σp(Br)
< σp(3Py). However, the analysis on the solid-state
specimens involves approximation because the various space groups,
molecular arrangements, solvation and desolvation effects, and coordination
structure distortions were found, but such factors are neglected here.
The structural distortion is known to regulate T1/2 to a considerable extent.16,30−32 The solution experiments will afford a better venue for the discussion
on the substituent effect.

Magnetic Properties in Solution
The solution magnetic
susceptibilities in acetone were acquired on a SQUID susceptometer.
Details of the experimental method have been described elsewhere.16 Although the SCO profiles were all gradual with
a similar shape, an appreciable difference in T1/2 was recorded (Figure 2b). The T1/2 values are
determined as 220, 260, 215, 280, and 270 K for X = Me, 2Th, N3, Br, and 3Py, respectively. The trend observed seems to be
approximately related to the electron-accepting/-donating properties.
Namely, electron-donating substituents (X = Me) stabilized the HS
state, whereas electron-withdrawing substituents (X = Br, 3Py) stabilized
the LS state, which is qualitatively the same as that of the solid-state
experiments.

The results on 12 derivatives in total16,17 are accumulated in Figure 3a, and the relation between T1/2 and σp is surveyed to establish a structure–SCO
property relationship. Actually, the plot displays a strong positive
correlation. A plot using the alternative substituent constant σp+ suitable for substituent
effects to a cationic center exhibits a positive correlation as well
(Figure 3b). The R2 correlation coefficients are comparable; 0.780
for σp and 0.768 for σp+. The solution data have no structural
information, but we suppose that the structural distortion factor
would be negligible because of the vast conformational freedom. Accordingly,
the solution experiments seem to be more appropriate than the solid-state
experiments to assess substituent effects. As previously pointed out,16,17 electron-donating substituents suppress T1/2 and electron-withdrawing substituents raise T1/2.

σp+. Dashed
lines represent the best linear fit.

The substituent dependence of T1/2 in
[Fe(X-pybox)2](ClO4)2 in acetone
solution can be verified with the trend known for T1/2 in [Fe(X-1-bpp)2](BF4)2 in acetone or nitromethane solution.30Figure 4 displays
the plot using the difference of T1/2 of
an X-substituted derivative from that of the mother X = H compound
as ΔT1/2. Because the 4-X-1-bpp
and 4-X-pybox series contain the double meridional chelation in common,
the steric effects are similar to each other. A relationship is formulated
as eq 1 and superposed
in Figure 4. The slope
close to unity implies that essentially the same substituent effects
are operative in both. Moreover, the comparison study indicates that
the counter anion dependence or solvent dependence could be negligible
in the solution experiments. 1

Density-Functional-Theory
(DFT) MO Calculation
We investigated
the theoretical MO calculation on the series of X-pybox ligands and
performed DFT calculation in the Gaussian 03 package.33 The B3LYP Hamiltonian34 with
the 6-311+G(2d,p) basis set was selected. To reproduce the solution
data, the geometry optimization is required, and only the ligand portion
(X-pybox) was subjected to calculation. This method would be welcomed
for ab initio prediction of T1/2 when
only the chemical formula of X-pybox is given. There have been several
known DFT functionals, B3LYP* and TPSSh, for example,35,36 suitable for the analysis of the SCO behavior on the whole coordination
compounds. In the present work, the metal-free organic ligand is subjected
to the calculation, so that the choice of B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p) would
be reasonable.

Because the crystal field effect is sensitive
to the charge or electron population of the ligating atom, the Mulliken
atomic charge at the pyridine nitrogen seems to be important. However,
it has been pointed out that the natural population analysis gives
better results than the Mulliken population analysis when precise
basis sets are chosen.37,38 Therefore, the natural orbital
population analysis was performed with the natural bond orbital (NBO)
option.39

Attention was paid to a
configuration problem around the biaryl-type
Csp2–Csp2 single
bonds. The pybox ligands and related chelatable ligands have a syn
conformation in the coordination compounds, though the most stable
form often is nearly anti20 (Scheme 3). To reproduce the conformation
after complexation, the geometry optimization started from the syn
form, eventually giving a configuration with a local potential minimum
close to that of an ideal syn form.

Scheme 3 Conformational Isomers
in Di- and Triimines
Syn and anti configurations are
classified with respect to the ligating nitrogen atoms

The natural charge at the pyridine nitrogen atom, ρ(Npy), and the energy levels of the pyridine C=N π
orbital, E(πpy), and the pyridine
lone-pair n orbital, E(npy), were obtained
and listed in Table 3. These values are varied depending on the substituent, and the T1/2 versus ρ(Npy) plot (Figure 5a) displays a positive
correlation. The molecular electrostatic potential surfaces are demonstrated
in Figure 5b,c for
MeO- and 4Py-pybox, respectively, under the same isosurface conditions.
The electronegative character can be seen around heteroatoms, and
in particular, the pyridine N atom in the former is more negative
than that of the latter. To argue the usefulness of ρ(Npy), correlations were checked by drawing the plots of σp and σp+ versus ρ(Npy) (Figure 6). Positive correlations were found with R2 = 0.410 and 0.540, respectively, and it is
notable that these coefficients are smaller than that of the T1/2 versus ρ(Npy) plot (0.734
in Figure 5a).

The matching of the energy levels has also been taken into consideration
when the ligand MOs interact with iron(II) orbitals. Figure 7 illustrates that T1/2 had a negative correlation with E(πpy) and E(npy), though
the data points were relatively scattered. It is not surprising that
the three calculated values, ρ(Npy), E(πpy), and E(npy), are
related to each other because the rich electron population or negatively
large ρ(Npy) lifts E(πpy) and E(npy).

Discussion
Substituent
Effect from an Empirical Approach
To establish
a prediction method of SCO T1/2, the solution
data were analyzed in connection with the substituent effect. We plotted
the solution T1/2 against σp and σp+ (Figure 3),
where the data on the known derivatives16,17 are included.
We can find a considerably good positive correlation, which indicates
that electron-donating substituents suppress T1/2, whereas electron-withdrawing substituents raise T1/2. An empirical relationship equation is expressed
as eq 2 (a dashed line
superposed in Figure 3a). This method is satisfactory for the prediction of T1/2 when the substituent constant is available. 2  

Substituent Effect from the DFT Calculation
Approach
Very recently, Brooker and co-workers reported the
relation between
the NMR chemical shift of the ligating nitrogen atom and SCO behavior.20 The chemical shifts were obtained by means of
spectroscopic and DFT computational methods. In that research, the 15N NMR spectroscopy was applied, but such methods are not
easily performed. Novikov et al. reported another way using a paramagnetic
shift of 1H NMR on the ligand protons.40 The pseudocontact shift depends on the calculated mutual
geometry between the 1H nucleus and unpaired electrons,
and the contact distributions are given from calculation. Both experimental
and computational techniques are needed.

On the other hand,
the MO calculation on the ligand is an easier way to approach SCO
analysis. The electron density is caused by the substituents, as usually
formulated with the σp and finally proven with the
MO calculation. This method has an intervening parameter (σp) in the discussion of the relation between the SCO temperature
and the substituent effect. However, it seems to be more convenient
if the SCO temperature is directly predicted from the calculation.
Furthermore, as the calculation results on [Fe(X-pybox)2](ClO4)2 (Figure 5a) show, the R2 correlation coefficient between T1/2 and ρ(Npy) is better than those of σp versus ρ(Npy) and σp+ versus ρ(Npy). A direct correlation using ρ(Npy) seems to be
a more reliable and convenient way to predict T1/2. In short, the substituent constants are not needed any
more. A correlation equation is empirically described with eq 3 (a dashed line superposed
in Figure 5). 3  

Application to the 1-bpp
Compounds
The present work
provides a prediction method for T1/2 only
from a chemical formula, enabling us to apply the DFT method to well-known
SCO-active [FeII(X-1-bpp)2](BF4)2 involving 4-substituted 1-bpp,30 for example. The calculation protocol was the same as that of the
4-X-pybox series, and the result is displayed in Figure 8. An astonishingly good correlation
(R2 = 0.980) appeared, as shown with a
dashed line. The best fit line is formulated with eq 4.c 4

population analysis. A dashed line represents the best linear fit.

Figure 9 shows the
correlations between σp versus ρ(Npy) and σp+ versus ρ(Npy). These plots still have a strong
correlation but relatively scattered data points, as indicated with R2 = 0.831 and 0.932, respectively. As Halcrow
et al. pointed out, the σp+ constants are slightly better than the σp ones to describe the results of the 1-bpp complexes.30 However, similar to the case of the X-pybox
compounds, the best way in the substituent effect analysis is to utilize
the ρ(Npy) parameter. Furthermore, the present method
is inexpensive in comparison with the usual theoretical treatments
including the calculation on the whole coordination compounds.20,30,35,36,41 The SCO temperature will be discussed in
a generalized manner according to the present method, regardless of
the different ligand platforms, such as pybox and 1-bpp.

best linear fit.

Application to the Azine-Substituted
Triazole Compounds
To pursue further generalization of the
present method, we expanded
the calculation work to another system, the azine (heteroaromatic
ring) dependence on T1/2 of [FeII(Lazinyl)2(NCBH3)2] (azinyl
= 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridazyl, 4-pyrimidinyl, 2-pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl).20 The electronic population on the ligating nitrogen
atom (NA; see Scheme 3) varies with respect to the heteroaromatic skeleton
itself and not as a substituent on the ring. The natural charge on
the ligating azinyl nitrogen atom, ρ(NA), was calculated
at the same level as those of the calculations on the 4-X-pybox and
4-X-1-bpp families. In this calculation, the starting structure is
restricted to a syn isomer (Scheme 3), like the two previous cases. Figure 10 shows a calculation result and clarifies
a distinct positive correlation between T1/2 and ρ(NA). The best fit line is expressed as eq 5 with R2 = 0.963. 5  

Figure 10 Plot of T1/2 for [FeII(Lazinyl)2(NCBH3)2] in CDCl3 solution20 vs ρ(NA) from the DFT natural population analysis. A dashed line represents
the best linear fit.

Apparently, a similar result was obtained here, when compared
with
the plot of T1/2 versus δ(NA) (15N NMR chemical shift) reported by Brooker
et al.,20 but there seems to be a different
meaning. Both the crystal field effect and NMR chemical shift originate
in the atomic charge in common. However, the 15N chemical
shift in the heteroaromatic ring involves an additional deshielding
effect from an aromatic ring current.42 After the deshielding effect is cancelled by accident in the comparison
work, a linear relation in the T1/2 versus
δ(NA) plot would appear. Therefore, the T1/2 versus ρ(NA) plot is concluded to
demonstrate a straightforward causal relationship. In short, the NMR
chemical shift is not needed in the discussion on T1/2.

The charge at the ligating nitrogen atom is
concluded to be essential
in discussion on SCO. The present DFT MO method would be applicable
to other SCO-active FeII complexes carrying substituted
pyridine-based N-donor ligands,43 and even
for different ligand systems involving azaaromatic rings.44 The electron population analysis at the ligating
nitrogen atom in a metal-free ligand by means of the DFT MO method
provides one of the most convenient and powerful ways to explain and
predict the SCO temperature.

Mechanism
The substituent effect
described here is
explained in terms of a perturbation from the substituent. When an
electron-donating group is introduced to the pyridine ring, the t2g energy level is raised, and the eg–t2g energy gap (Δoct) becomes narrower, favoring
the HS state and low T1/2 (Figure 11). With an electron-withdrawing
group, it is vice versa. The σp and σp+ constants contain
two major contributions: one is the inductive effect along the σ
electron system and another is the mesomeric or resonance effect through
the π electron system. In general, the latter becomes obvious
when the 2- or 4-position in the six-membered aromatic ring is substituted.
Therefore, the σp and σp+ constants are adequate empirical
representatives to comprehend the substituent effect in the SCO compounds
involving 4-X-substituted pyridine-based ligands.

Figure 11 Model explaining the
substituent effect on T1/2 from the d−π
interaction. A π-electron-rich
heteroaromatic ring stabilizes the iron(II) HS state.

The DFT calculation supports the proposed mechanism. Figures 5a, 8, and 10 highlight the role of the
electron-withdrawing
or -donating nature of the substituent group or heteroaromatic skeleton,
and the charge of the ligating nitrogen atom is tuned. In the case
of the Lazinyl series, the substituent effect belongs to
the heteroaromatic ring itself. The logic never changes; the electron
population on the ligating nitrogen atom increases or decreases, depending
on the electronic structure of the heteroaromatic rings.

The
dσ/dπ symmetry consideration tells us that the
t2g energy level is perturbed through the dπ–pπ
interaction from the ligand π electron system (Figure 11). In addition to the orbital
overlap, the matching of the energy level of each orbital has also
been taken into account. The electron density at each atom is responsible
for the shift of the energy levels of relevant MOs. Although correlations
appear for both E(πpy) and E(npy) to T1/2, E(πpy) has a higher energy level than E(npy), and there seems to be an advantage in
the interaction between the πpy and iron(II) t2g orbitals over the interaction between the npy and iron(II) eg orbitals. In other words, the dπ–pπ
interaction serves a major path in tuning T1/2.d

Finally, we have to make a comment
on the validity that a purely
enthalpy term defined with the Coulombic interaction regulates T1/2 while an entropy term is set aside. The
transition temperature and behavior depend on entropy as well as enthalpy;
namely, ΔG = ΔH – T1/2ΔS and the equilibrium
condition with ΔG = 0. According to the treatment
of the linear free-energy relationships,45 a constant ΔS regardless of the substituents
would guarantee that the change of ΔG is connected
to the change of ΔH. The entropy difference
originates in the spin state and vibrational freedom.46 In solution SCO, organization of solvation molecules may
also contribute to the entropy term. The SCO in a series of substituent
variations with the unique mechanism tends to have a constant ΔS. Even if ΔS is variable, linearly
correlated ΔH and ΔS would be an alternative condition.45 Kepp
and co-workers35 suggested the enthalpy–entropy
compensation47 in many SCO materials with
various structures from the survey research and theoretical consideration.
Therefore, the discussion on ΔG in the SCO
can approximately be replaced with the argument of ΔH.

Conclusions
We investigated the
SCO behavior on 12 derivatives [FeII(X-pybox)2](ClO4)2, and the substituent
effect was analyzed with the DFT MO calculation performed on the metal-free
ligands. The geometry was optimized and the natural population analysis
gave the ligating pyridine nitrogen charge ρ(Npy).
The T1/2 versus ρ(Npy) plot has a better correlation than the T1/2 versus σp or σp+ plot. When only the information of chemical
formula of the ligand is available or a substituent constant is unavailable,
the DFT calculation method is a promising option. Actually, the present
method was applied to another SCO-active family, [FeII(X-1-bpp)2](BF4)2, which possesses an analogous
meridional coordination structure from 4-substituted pyridine-based
ligands. An excellent correlation appeared in the T1/2 versus ρ(Npy) plot.

This calculation
method was diverted to the triazole ligand system
substituted with a heteroaromatic ring, [FeII(Lazinyl)2(NCBH3)2], to generalize this
method. The heteroaromatic groups were varied in pyridine, pyridazine,
pyrimidine, and pyrazine rings. The charge at the ligating nitrogen
atom (ρ(NA)) is again concluded to be an essential
parameter in the discussion on the T1/2 shift.

The electron population analysis at the ligating nitrogen
atom
in a metal-free ligand by means of the DFT MO method provides one
of the most convenient and powerful ways to explain and predict the
SCO temperature.

Crystallographic Study
X-ray diffraction data of [Fe(X-pybox)2](ClO4)2·nMeOH
(X = N3, Br, 3Py) were collected on a Saturn70 CCD diffractometer
with graphite monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073
Å). The structures were directly solved by a heavy-atom method
and expanded using Fourier techniques in the crystalstructure program package.48 The parameters were
refined in the SHELXL program.49 Numerical
absorption correction was used. Hydrogen atoms were placed at calculated
positions, and their parameters were refined as “riding.”
The thermal displacement factors of nonhydrogen atoms were refined
anisotropically. Selected crystallographic data are given in Table 1, and important bond
lengths are listed in Table 2. A pseudo-polymorph of the X = Br derivative was found. Selected
crystallographic parameters are as follows: [Fe(Br-pybox)2](ClO4)2·3MeOH, monoclinic P21/c, a = 9.627(2), b = 17.371(4), c = 20.100(5) Å, b = 96.333(11)°, V = 3340.8(13) Å3, Z = 4, d = 1.875 g·cm–3, μ(Mo Kα) = 3.090 mm–1, R(F) (I >
2σ(I)) = 0.0661, wR(F2) (all data) = 0.1667, G.O.F. = 1.031, T =
100 K for 7649 reflections. A crystallographic study on the X = Me
and 2Th derivatives clarified the cell parameters as follows: [Fe(Me-pybox)2](ClO4)2·nMeOH,
tetragonal, a = 20.433(7), b = 20.037(5)
Å, V = 8366(4) Å3 and Z = 8 at 100 K; [Fe(2Th-pybox)2](ClO4)2·0.75MeOH, triclinic, P1̅, a = 17.084(4), b = 17.905(4), c = 24.247(7) Å, α = 90.225(10), β = 99.720(11),
γ = 95.326(9)°, V = 7278(3) Å3, and Z = 8 at 100 K.

CCDC numbers

parameter tables.

Magnetic Study
Magnetic susceptibilities
of polycrystalline
and solution forms of [Fe(X-pybox)2](ClO4)2·X(solv.) (X = Me, 2Th, N3, Br, 3Py) were
measured on a Quantum Design MPMS-XL7 SQUID magnetometer with a static
field of 0.5 T. Solution specimens were mounted in a sealed NMR sample
tube. Details have been described elsewhere.16

DFT Calculation Study
DFT MO calculation was performed
with the GAUSSIAN 03 package33 running
on a Windows PC. The geometry was optimized, and the self-consistent-field
(SCF) energy was converged on the B3LYP Hamiltonian50 with the 6-311+G(2d,p) basis set. The criterion of the
SCF energy convergence was set to 10–5 au. The NBO
analysis was performed with the NBO option executing the Gaussian
NBO version 3.1.39 The natural charge at
the pyridine nitrogen atom, ρ(Npy), and the MO energy
levels, E(πpy) and E(npy), could be read out from the text output.

a Considerably short intermolecular
atomic distances are found; 2.906(9) Å for Br1···O10ClO4 and 2.997(4) Å for Br2···O5ClO4, which are 11–13% shorter than the sum
of the van der Waals radii (3.35 Å).29 Distances near the sum of the van der Waals radii are also found;
2.883(6) Å for O3oxazoline···O9ClO4 and 2.838(8) Å for O1oxazoline···O11ClO4. Although the counter
anion intervenes, intermolecular interactions are operative and construct
an interactive network.

b The
solvated methanol oxygen atoms
have another contact with neighboring [Fe(3Py-pybox)2]
complex ion; 3.093(7) Å for O13MeOH···C14oxazoline, which is close to the sum of the van der Waals radii
(2.9 Å),29 and 2.330 Å for O13MeOH···H17Aoxazoline, 2.319 Å
for O14MeOH···H12pyridine, and
2.435 Å for O14MeOH···H5pyridine. Namely, the solvate molecule plays a role of an interaction network
bridge. Such an interaction network may enhance an abrupt character
of the SCO behavior.

c From
a closer look at Figures 5a and 8,
we can find that the latter displays a better correlation than the
former. The oxazoline ring has saturated bonds while the pyrazole
ring is aromatic. The calculation was performed on the metal-free
ligands, and the degrees of perturbation upon forming coordination
bonds might be different. Another possible explanation is the difference
of the experimental methods. In the present study, the SQUID susceptometry
was applied, but Halcrow and co-workers utilized the Evans method.30

d One
may assume that more negative
charge on the donor atom would make the ligand field stronger, thus
enhancing Δoct and favoring the LS state. In the
present mechanism, the dπ–pπ interaction giving
a decrease of Δoct is more vigorous than the possible
effect mentioned above. Although the charge is regarded as a convenient
metric, an MO consideration is indispensable for discussing ligand
fields from aromatic ring coordination.
