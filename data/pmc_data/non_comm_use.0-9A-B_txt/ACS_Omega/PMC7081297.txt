Graphene-based nanomaterials have
attracted researchers from various
fields due to their extraordinary physical, chemical, and electrochemical
properties. An emerging class of graphene-based nanostructures and
nanocomposites is considered to be a promising solution to various
types of environmental pollution. The electro-Fenton process is one
of the easy and effective approaches to treating a wide range of organic
pollutants in a liquid medium. The usage of graphene-based electrodes
in the electro-Fenton process is considered to be a promising and
cleaner way to produce reactive oxygen species to mineralize organic
contaminants rapidly. Graphene derivatives are used to immobilize
various heterogeneous Fenton catalysts for improved catalytic activity,
stability, and reusability. In this review, the importance of graphene-based
materials in improving the performance efficiency in the electro-Fenton
process is presented along with an enhancement mechanism through the
following discussions: (i) the significance of oxygen functional groups
and nitrogen doping on graphene layers to enhance the two-electron
oxygen reduction reactions; (ii) the advantages of iron-loaded graphene-based
materials as catalysts and composite electrodes for the enhanced production
of reactive oxygen species; (iii) a summary of various forms of graphene-based
materials, modifications in their chemical structure, properties,
and applications in the electro-Fenton process to remove organic contaminants.

Introduction
The electro-Fenton process has received
much attention in water
and wastewater treatment, after its first documentation by the research
groups of Prof. M. A. Oturan1 and Prof.
Enric Brillas2 in the early stages of 2000
and is mainly due to the higher mineralization efficiency of the process
even for the persistent organic pollutants, lesser cost, and simplicity
of operation. The electro-Fenton process utilizes in-situ-generated
hydrogen peroxide and externally added ferrous ion for the generation
of hydroxyl radicals, which have the highest standard redox potential
(E°(•OH/H2O) =
2.8 V/SHE) next to fluorine (E°(F2/HF) = 3.05 V/SHE) and are able to attack organic pollutants present
in the aqueous medium nonselectively, until its complete mineralization.3−5

A cathode is the working electrode of the electro-Fenton process
as the rate of pollutant degradation mainly depends on hydrogen peroxide
production at the cathode by the two-electron reduction of oxygen
under acidic conditions and the regeneration of the ferrous ion via
the cathodic reduction of ferric ions.6,7 Carbonaceous
materials were found to be effective electrodes for the generation
of hydrogen peroxide, and materials such as graphite, carbon felt,
graphite felt, carbon-polytetrafluoroethylene, graphite-polytetrafluoroethylene,
carbon nanotubes, carbon sponges, activated carbon fibers, and reticulated
vitreous carbon were used as effective cathodes in the electro-Fenton
process.8 Two-dimensional carbon, i.e.,
graphene and its allied forms such as graphene oxide and reduced graphene
oxides, received much attention after the isolation of graphene by
Novoselov and co-workers in 2004.9 In addition
to water and wastewater treatment, these carbon materials were found
to be effective in various applications including sensors, fuel cells,
nanoantenna, touch screens, batteries, light-emitting diodes, sound
transducers, and liquid crystal displays.10

The present study reviews the application of two-dimensional
carbon
materials in the electro-Fenton process. Graphene-based materials
are used as effective cathodes as well as a catalyst support in the
electro-Fenton process. The process efficiency enhancement mechanism
and the importance of graphene in the improved performance of the
electro-Fenton process are analyzed in detail.

Application of Graphene
in the Electro-Fenton Process
Graphene as a Working Electrode
Though the electro-Fenton
process is considered to be one of the promising processes in oxidizing
organic contaminants, the reaction kinetics is mainly controlled by
the rate of production of hydrogen peroxide. The production of hydrogen
peroxide is mainly influenced by the electronic structure of carbon
atoms and the physicochemical properties of carbon-based electrodes.
Utilizing graphene-based electrodes in the electro-Fenton process
as cathode materials is considered to be a more promising and cleaner
way of producing hydrogen peroxide during the treatment process. Oxygen-based
functional groups present in the carbon cathode act as the active
sites to adsorb the dissolved oxygen molecules and subsequently convert
them to hydrogen peroxide through a two-electron-based oxygen reduction
reaction (ORR). Pristine graphene consist of sp2-hybridized
carbon and oxygen defects introduced onto the graphene layers acting
as the active site for producing hydrogen peroxide through two-electron
ORR with enhanced selectivity.11 Typically,
graphene is produced through the Hummer’s method, which primarily
produces exfoliated graphene oxide (GO). GO is characterized to have
highly reactive oxygen functional groups resulting from the overoxidation
of the graphite carbon framework during the synthesis processes.12 These abundant oxygen functional groups present
in GO exhibit high charge-transfer resistance. Hence, the electron-transfer
ability of the GO is restored through the reduction of excess oxygen
content present in GO sheets. The reduction of oxygen is done through
a chemical, thermal, or electrochemical pathway.13,14 During the reduction of GO, major oxygen functionalities which introduced
the charge-transfer resistance are reduced. Only the stable oxygen
functionalities (O–H, C–O, and C=O) that are
contributed by phenol, quinone, ether, and carbonyl groups remain.

The defects introduced by the stable oxygen functionalities acts
as the catalytic active site to selectively enhance the two-electron
ORR to produce hydrogen peroxide, whereas the metal-based catalysts/electrodes
electrocatalytically convert the oxygen into water molecules through
four-electron oxygen reduction reactions especially for fuel cell
applications. Moreover, the overpotential required for two-electron
ORR (E0 = −0.67 V/SHE) in converting
oxygen into hydrogen peroxide is less than the four-electron ORR (E0 = −1.23 V/SHE) (eqs 1 and 2) because the
production of hydrogen peroxide through the two-electron pathway involves
breaking only the π bond of the oxygen while the σ bond
is preserved (O–O).15 The four-electron
pathway in producing the H2O molecule requires the rupture
of the strong O=O bonds of the oxygen molecule.12 1   2  As an efficient catalyst for the electrogeneration
of hydrogen peroxide through the electroreduction of oxygen, graphene
exhibits high selectivity and catalytic activity toward the two-electron
pathway and suppresses the four-electron pathway for a wider potential
window.11

Graphene-modified carbon
electrodes are proven to exhibit enhanced
performance in producing hydrogen peroxide. The electrochemically
reduced GO-modified carbon felt was used as the cathode for the electro-Fenton
process by Let et al.14,16 The reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-modified
electrode exhibited a high electron-transfer ability with the increase
in redox current and decrease in charge-transfer resistance compared
to those of the raw carbon felt electrode. Typically, cyclic voltammetry,
linear sweep voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
analysis were used as the electroanalytical techniques to prove the
enhanced electrochemical property of the graphene-based electrode
toward hydrogen peroxide production.12,14,16 The rGO-modified cathode decolorized model dye acid
orange 7 within 5 min and completely mineralized after 8 h of treatment.
The electrode was reported to be stable even after 10 cycles of reuse.14 Mousset et al.17 studied
a graphene monolayer, multilayer, and foam as cathodes for the electro-Fenton
process. They were proven to be feasible for electro-generating hydrogen
peroxide effectively compared to unmodified graphite and carbon felt
electrodes at the optimum applied potential of −0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl.
When the hydrophilicity of the cathode surface is improved, the oxygen
diffusion is also increased, thus resulting in enhanced H2O2 electrogeneration. All three forms of the graphene
electrode efficiently produced ·OH radicals with a sustained
Fe2+ regeneration rate and H2O2 electrogeneration
rate. Graphene foam was found to be superior to monolayer and multilayer
graphene electrodes due to its high electroactive surface area, low
charge-transfer resistance, high purity, and 3D porous nature. For
the graphene foam cathode, the H2O2 electrogeneration
yield was found to be 4.25 mg of H2O2 L–1 cm–3. As a model contaminant, the
phenol degradation rate was estimated to be 0.0081 min–1 and the mineralization rate was about 0.0818 h–1. An ultrahigh yield of H2O2 was reported for
the graphite felt cathode modified with electrochemically exfoliated
graphene.18 The electrochemically exfoliated
graphene consists of three to four layers with a small number of oxygen
defects. The H2O2 generation rate was 7.7 mg
h–1 cm–2 with an energy consumption
of 9.7 kW h kg–1. Furthermore, electrochemically
exfoliated graphene was characterized to exhibit a high electron-transfer
rate and improved the surface hydrophilicity which enhanced the oxygen
diffusion, thus resulting in the enhancement of H2O2 generation. A schematic representation of the ORR process
in a modified graphite felt cathode with electrochemically exfoliated
graphene is given in Figure 1.

Researchers also reported that the doping of nitrogen
onto the
graphene sheets can significantly enhance the H2O2 electrogeneration through increasing the selectivity for the two-electron
ORR pathway. N-Doping on carbon-based materials creates favorable
synergy among the electronic structure, chemical compositions, and
physicochemical properties, resulting in a higher faradaic efficiency
(95–98% at acidic pH) toward the production of hydrogen peroxide.19 N-Doping onto the graphene sheet can introduce
highly efficient active sites to electrocatalytically reduce the oxygen
molecules and also change the oxygen adsorption mode. The incorporation
of nitrogen atoms into the carbon lattice creates relatively positive
charge density adjacent to the carbon atoms along with the electron-accepting
property.12 Though the conventional N-doped
carbon-based catalysts are reported to be efficient at catalyzing
the four-electron ORR, recent studies report the excellent catalytic
ability of N-doped graphene toward the improved selectivity of two-electron
ORR.20 It explicitly shows the importance
of the chemical structure of electrocatalyst material to introduce
selectivity into oxygen reduction reactions to obtain the desired
products. Graphite felt modified with N-doped graphene was used as
a cathode for the electro-Fenton process.20 The selectivity of the two-electron pathway was improved due to
the increased mass transfer and oxygen diffusion, which prevent the
further conversion of H2O2 to water. Also, the
presence of a high percentage of pyridinic nitrogen in the N-doped
graphene enhances the selectivity and catalytic activity toward the
two-electron pathway by impairing the ability to weaken the O–O
bond. A schematic illustration of ORR on N-doped graphene is given
in Figure 2. Yang et
al.21 reported the in situ metal-free electrochemical
advanced oxidation process using an N-doped graphene-modified graphite
felt cathode. The graphene-modified cathode increased the electron-transfer
rate and also enhanced the oxygen diffusion by increasing the surface
hydrophilicity, resulting in improved H2O2 production.
Using the cathode, the electrogeneration of H2O2 was not found to be changed, but the existence of ·OH and ·O2 radicals was found using electron-spin resonance spectra
even without the addition of the ferrous ion catalyst. The degradation
rate in the metal-free process was found to be 4 times higher than
in the conventional electro-Fenton process. Enhanced selectivity toward
two-electron ORR by graphitized N-doped single-walled carbon nanohorns
is reported by Iglesias et al.22 The faradaic
efficiency needed to produce hydrogen peroxide was found to be 98%
in an acidic environment; excellent catalytic reactivity was also
observed in an alkaline environment. Moreover, the onset potential
was found to be more positive under all of the pH conditions, such
as +0.40 V at pH 1.0, +0.53 V at 7.4, and +0.71 V at pH 13.0. Synergistic
effects such as favorable electronic structure, the distribution of
N atoms, and enhanced porosity resulted in the selectivity toward
two-electron ORR.

Among the conventional electro-Fenton cathodes, the
gas diffusion
electrode (GDE) was reported to exhibit a higher removal rate due
to the special porous membrane designed to create an efficient three-phase
contact among solid, liquid, and gas.23 GDE efficiently produces a large amount of hydrogen peroxide due
to the improved oxygen mass transfer by its porous nature. Researchers
also reported the graphene-based GDE for the enhanced electrogeneration
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the electro-Fenton process. Graphene@graphite-based
GDE was developed by Zhang et al.23 and
used as a cathode in the electro-Fenton process to oxidize rhodamine
B dye. About 16% less energy consumption was achieved compared to
that of conventional GDE. An electron-transfer number of about 2.1
to 2.2 was estimated for ORR in a particular potential range using
a rotating disk electrode. A higher corrosive resistance and reuse
ability were also reported. Garcia-Rodriguez et al.24 used graphene-based GDE for the mineralization of the electronic
wastewater. Carbon cloth-poly(tetrafluoroethylene)
(PTFE) GDE was coated with electrochemically exfoliated graphene.
An electrogenerated H2O2 concentration of as
high as 495 mg L–1 was reached in the liquid medium,
and about 80% of the wastewater was mineralized in 180 min. Liu et
al.25 developed a nitrogen-doped graphene@carbon
nanotube (CNT) composite-based GDE that was employed in the degradation
of dimethyl phthalate. The kinetic rate constant was found to be 0.0322
min–1, which was 14, 19, and 54 times higher than
that for graphite GDE, graphene GDE, and CNT GDE, respectively. The
lowest energy consumption was found for the novel electrode rather
than for the other GDE electrodes. The lowest onset potential was
achieved due to the connection established between graphene and CNT
and the nitrogen doping.

Graphene as a Supporting Material
Graphene and its
derivatives are promising materials to be potentially used for the
immobilization of various nanoparticles in multiple applications.
GO is very attractive for use as a support material because of its
edge reactivity due to the presence of abundant oxygen functional
groups, a large surface area, surface accessibility, and unique 2D
lamellar structure. Due to the existence of strong π–π
interactions among the graphene sheets, they are prone to restack
on each other, which results in the reduced accessible surface sites
and stability.26 When graphene-based derivatives
are used as supporting materials, it prevents the aggregation of both
graphene sheets as well as the nanoparticles that need to be immobilized.
This enhances the overall catalytic activity as well as the stability
of both components due to the synergistic interaction existing among
them.32 Graphene sheets lack the essential
oxygen functional groups for the likely immobilization of the nanoparticles.
The presence of oxygen functional groups on GO/mildly reduced GO favors
potential utilization as a supporting matrix to synthesize nanocomposites.
The presence of abundant oxygen functional groups on the basal plane
(hydroxyl and epoxides) as well as on edges (carboxyl and carbonyl)
acts as the nucleation site for metal ions to produce GO-based nanocomposites.32 The major problem associated with the conventional
Fenton process is the utilization of a homogeneous iron catalyst which
produces a large amount of iron sludge and prevents the reuse of the
iron catalyst. A heterogeneous iron catalyst was developed for the
reuse of iron catalysts such as Fe3O4, Fe2O3, and Fe@Fe2O3. Recently,
graphene-supported iron oxide catalysts were examined as potential
heterogeneous Fenton, photo-Fenton, and electro-Fenton catalysts,
and those catalysts exhibited enhanced performance over a wide range
of pH with higher catalytic stability, activity, and reusability.23,32

Iron-Loaded Graphene as Both a Catalyst and a Working Electrode
The important aspect of cathode material selection in the electro-Fenton
process depends on the high production of H2O2 and the faster regeneration of the iron catalyst, whereas the iron-loaded
graphene electrodes could produce ·OH and ·O2 radicals as major products at the interface due to the simultaneous
decomposition of electrogenerated H2O2. In this
case, H2O2 could be electrogenerated by graphene;
meanwhile, the immobilized iron catalyst catalyzes the decomposition
of electrogenerated H2O2 into ·OH radicals.
This can complete the electro-Fenton reaction without any need of
external chemical addition. The iron catalyst to be immobilized on
the graphene-based cathode should possess an excellent reversible
redox property along with high catalytic stability. Hence, the electrocatalytic
decomposition can efficiently occur through the reversible electron-transfer
reactions. Magnetite is one the heterogeneous Fenton catalysts, has
a permanent magnetic property, and contains both Fe2+ and
Fe3+, hence transferring the electrons effectively without
changing its octahedral structure.13 Moreover,
pure Fe3O4 is not suitable as the electro-Fenton
cathode since it has low electrical conductivity, a difficult H2O2 electrogeneration capacity, and will be easily
dissolved at low pH.26 The graphene/Fe3O4 oxide composite is reported to have excellent
electrochemical properties.13,26

In the clean
electro-Fenton process (involving the heterogeneous iron catalyst
impregnated on the conductive carbon matrix with no production of
iron sludge), the graphene/Fe3O4 composite cathode
was reported to produce ROS effectively. Shen et al.26 used the aerosol synthesis methodology to produce graphene-Fe3O4 hollow hybrid microspheres for use as a catalyst
for the heterogeneous Fenton and electro-Fenton reaction. A uniform
microsphere with hollow structure, high magnetization, and high Fenton
catalytic ability was achieved with 30 wt % graphene catalyst (30G-FeO).
Electrochemical analysis showed that an enhancement of the electrocatalytic
ability of the electrode material was achieved as a result of the
two-electron-dominated process. Iron oxide containing a graphene/carbon
nanotube-based carbon aerogel was used as the cathode for the electro-Fenton
process by Chen et al.27 The electrode
was synthesized by the sol–gel method, followed by a carbonization
step. The coexistence of graphene and carbon nanotubes increased the
surface area and strength of the electrode. An enhancement in the
production of reactive oxygen species was observed due to the abundant
porosity and large surface area along with the excellent adsorption
capacity. About 5% iron loading on graphene/carbon nanotubes was found
to be optimum. About 99% removal of MB was obtained in 60 min at pH
3 with an applied current of 15 mA. Moreover, the ·OH radical
generation rate mainly depends on the H2O2 generation
rate and the iron regeneration rate. The H2O2 generation rate depends on the active sites for the two-electron
oxygen reduction reaction. Quinone-based functional groups can act
as the active site. Zhang et al.28 fabricated
the anthraquinone-functionalized reduced graphene oxide electrode
and used it as a cathode in the electro-Fenton process. Synthesized
α-(goethite) and γ-(lepidocrocite) mixed-phase FeOOH catalysts
was used as the heterogeneous Fenton catalyst. It was reported that
the decomposition of electrogenerated H2O2 was
mainly catalyzed by surface iron species (≡ indicates surface-bound
iron species in heterogeneous catalyst). Initially, the electrogenerated
H2O2 formed a complex with surface-bound iron
oxide as ≡FeIII–OH·H2O2 and decomposed into HO2•, ·OH,
and ferryl iron species (≡FeIV=O). Divyapriya
et al.13 reported the innate quinone-functionalized
electrochemically exfoliated graphene (QEEG)/Fe3O4 composite electrode for the electro-Fenton application. The mechanism
of formation of reactive oxygen species on the graphene/Fe3O4 composite electrode was given in detail (Figure 3). The presence of the innate
quinone functional group on the electrochemically exfoliated graphene
mainly acts as the active site for the electrogeneration of H2O2 through the two-electron pathway. The electrogenerated
H2O2 prefers to bind with the ≡Fe3+–OH/≡Fe2+–OH active sites
of the Fe3O4 (eqs 3 and 4). Furthermore, ≡Fe2+ in immobilized Fe3O4 catalyzes the
decomposition of adsorbed H2O2 (H2O2 ads) into ·OH radicals and converted them
to ≡Fe3+ during the reaction (eq 5). 3   4   5   6   7   8  The regeneration of ≡Fe3+ to ≡Fe3+ happens through the single electron transfer
from the cathode carbon skeleton (eq 6). The conversion of ≡Fe3+ to ≡Fe2+ can also happen during the conversion of H2O2 ads to (HO2•)ads (eq 7). Furthermore,
the desorbed HO2• radicals (eq 8) involve the successive oxidization
of organic contaminants.

oxygen species

This reaction more likely
occurs in an alkaline environment. This
cycle continues to convert electrogenerated H2O2 to ·OH radicals. The electrode showed the stable catalytic
property even after 10 cycles of electrode reuse.

Ferrocene
is an iron-based organometallic compound that exhibits
a highly reversible redox property and catalytic stability due to
its electron donor–acceptor conjugate structure. Divyapriya
et al.29 reported the application of the
ferrocene-functionalized graphene-based electrode for the oxidation
of ciprofloxacin. During the catalytic conversion of electrogenerated
H2O2 on graphene, H2O2 reacts with Fe2+-centered ferrocene (Fc) and further
decomposes to ·OH radicals. After the reaction, Fe2+-centered ferrocene is transformed to the Fe3+-centered
ferricinium ion (Fc+). The regeneration of Fc further occurred
by single electron transfer directly from the graphene cathode or
can also occur along with the conversion of adsorbed H2O2 to HO2• radicals. Greater
than 99% removal of ciprofloxacin was achieved within 15 min at the
target pH, with a removal rate of 0.222 min–1.

Membrane-based treatment processes are fast and efficient and have
a small footprint. However, biofouling and concentrate generation
are the major issues that affect the performance and economics of
the process. On the other hand, the electro-Fenton process needs more
energy to treat the low-concentration wastewater. A hybrid membrane
and the electro-Fenton process can complement each other and reduce
the limitations. Zhao et al.30 produced
the conductive membrane to be used as the cathode material for the
electro-Fenton reaction. This novel conductive cathode membrane was
synthesized through the modification of a commercial polyester filter
cloth membrane by coating with graphene and polypyrrole via the vapor-phase
polymerization process. The synthesized membrane was reported to be
highly conductive and showed low charge-transfer resistance. Methylene
blue was removed in filtration mode. A conductive membrane was connected
to the cathode, and stainless steel was used as the anode. The treatment
efficiency was significantly affected by the pH, aeration, applied
current, and membrane flux. Degradation was significantly achieved
by the electrogenerated H2O2 along with the
membrane function. At the end of 120 min of treatment, removal efficiencies
of about 59.2, 64.0, and 74.6% were obtained for the PPy, Gr/PPy,
and Fe-Gr/PPy membranes, respectively. Jiang et al.31 reported the graphene-modified catalytic membrane for the
oxidation of antibiotic florfenicol at a low concentration. The removal
rate of florfenicol during the electro-Fenton catalytic membrane process
(10.2 ± 0.1 mg m–2 h–1) was
much higher than during the single filtration process (2.5 ±
0.1 mg m–2 h–1) and electro-Fenton
process (4.3 ± 0.05 mg m–2 h–1). The process utilized the membrane process as a way to concentrate
the florfenicol and to increase the mass transfer for the effective
oxidation through the electrogenerated reactive oxygen species.

Conclusions and Future Perspectives
In this review, applications
of various graphene-based working
electrodes and a heterogeneous catalyst support used for the electro-Fenton
process have been summarized, showing that graphene-based electrodes
and catalysts are recognized to efficiently produce reactive oxygen
species and mineralize the wide range of organic contaminants in synthetic/real
wastewater effluents with reduced energy consumption. They are also
proven to be highly active, catalytically stable, and reusable. The
modification of the graphene chemical structure with oxygen functionalities
and nitrogen doping significantly enhances the ORR selectivity. Stable
oxygen functional groups present in the rGO act as the active site
for the adsorption of dissolved oxygen and subsequently convert it
to hydrogen peroxide. In N-doped graphene, synergistic effects such
as a favorable electronic structure, the distribution of N atoms,
and enhanced porosity resulted in the selectivity toward two-electron
ORR. Graphene-iron oxide-based composite electrodes, graphene-based
gas diffusion electrodes, and graphene-based membranes open the way
for a cleaner and greener treatment of water and wastewater. Hydroxyl
radical production and the mineralization efficiency of graphene-based
electrodes and catalysts are largely influenced by various parameters
such as the graphene-to-Fenton catalyst ratio, nature of the support
material used to fabricate the cathode, process of reduction of GO,
applied potential, nature of the electrolyte, and concentration of
contaminants.

Though the graphene-based electrodes are proven
to be highly efficient
cathodes in the electro-Fenton process, the large-scale applications
of these materials are still questionable. More research needs to
be focused on producing cost-effective, mechanically stable electrodes
on a larger scale along with the firm attachment of the graphene/graphene-based
composite on the support electrode. Many applications of graphene
in the electro-Fenton process have been intensely examined on the
laboratory scale; however, there have been no pilot-scale studies
reported until now. For the practical application of these potential
nanomaterials, upgrading the laboratory-scale studies to pilot-scale
studies is necessary for a greater perspective. It is also important
to explore various kinds of electrode and reactor configurations and
support materials for the large-scale applications of these promising
materials. Furthermore, for the real world applications of the graphene-based
materials, detailed studies on the environmental implications need
to be carried out along with the synthesis methodology and the economic
feasibility. Excellent physical, chemical, electrochemical, optical,
thermal, and mechanical properties are reported for graphene and for
carbon nanotubes, fullerene, carbon quantum dots and will be reported
for many more materials yet to come in the near future. This introduces
numerous ways to explore these nanocarbons in the electro-Fenton process
with a wider horizon.
