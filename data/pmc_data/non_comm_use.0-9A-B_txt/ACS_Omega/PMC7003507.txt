The enantioselective
syntheses of (−)-coniine, DAB-1, and nectrisine have been developed,
utilizing a complementary strategy of enzyme- and transition metal-catalyzed
reactions. The initial stereocenter was set with >99% enantioselectivity
via an enzyme-catalyzed hydrocyanation reaction. Substrate incompatibilities
with the natural enzyme were overcome by tactical utilization of ruthenium-catalyzed
olefin metathesis to functionalize an enzyme-derived (R)-allylic fragment. The piperidine and pyrrolidine alkaloid natural
products were obtained by a route that leveraged regio- and stereoselective
palladium-catalyzed 1,3-substitutive reactions.

Introduction
Functionalized piperidine
and pyrrolidine alkaloids are a broad and diverse class of molecules
that typically exhibit high levels of biological activity. Nitrogen
heterocycles are ubiquitous among natural products and are found in
countless pharmaceutical compounds.1−4 Importantly, the biological activity of
these molecules is often tied to a specific enantiomer. Therefore,
deeper understanding of the importance of piperidine and pyrrolidine
alkaloids is reliant on the development of new strategies for their
enantioselective synthesis. Enzymatic reactions are a prime source
of enantioenriched material, and their use has been critical to the
development of enantioselective reactions.5,6 One
significant drawback of enzymes, however, is their often-limited substrate
compatibility toward small organic molecules. Our group has focused
on augmenting the high enantioselectivities of enzyme-catalyzed reactions
with transition metal-catalyzed processes that are able to stereospecifically
alter the position and substitution of enzymatically derived stereochemistry.7−9

We targeted (−)-coniine (1), DAB-1 (2), and nectrisine (3) as platforms to demonstrate
the general applicability of our synthetic strategy toward the larger
classes of saturated nitrogen heterocycles (Figure 1). Coniine has a storied past in toxicology
circles as the active poison of spotted hemlock and is known most
notably for its role in the death of Socrates.10 Furthermore, the de novo chemical synthesis of coniine
remains a touchstone for the synthesis of substituted piperidines.11−17 DAB-1 (2) and nectrisine (3) are polyhydroxylated
pyrrolidine iminosugars isolated from terrestrial sources.18,19 DAB-1 is a potent inhibitor (IC50 = 9.3 μM) against
a specific glycosidase, rabbit muscle glycogen phosphorylase, while
being mostly ineffective toward glycogen synthesis enzymes.20 Structurally related nectrisine (3) is also a strong inhibitor of α-glucosidases.21 Selective inhibitors of this type are implicated
in the treatment of diabetes as well as other sugar-related diseases.
As a result, DAB-1 and nectrisine have been the targets of many synthetic
efforts and remain useful targets to demonstrate stereoselective reaction
methods in complex settings. A majority of these approaches utilized
the chiral pool to establish many of the stereocenters;22−31 however, a small subset of more recent syntheses has used other
enantioselective methods to install the requisite stereochemistry.32−35 As for our own approach, we envisioned the rapid, highly stereocontrolled
syntheses of these molecules that would diverge from a single enantiopure
precursor. More precisely, we would blend the utility of a highly
enantioselective enzymatic reaction with the specificity of modern
transition metal-catalyzed reactions to achieve this goal.

Figure 1 Target alkaloids:
(−)-coniine (1), DAB-1 (2), and nectrisine
(3).

Our unified synthetic
plan for (−)-coniine and DAB-1 incorporates three catalytic
methodologies for the construction of the heterocyclic rings and stereocenters
(Scheme 1). The six-membered
ring of 1 would be synthesized by ruthenium-catalyzed
ring-closing metathesis of diene precursor 4, while five-membered
rings would be accessed by cyclization of a γ-amino ester such
as 5 after appropriate functionalization of the alkene.
We were encouraged by the validation of some of these late-stage approaches
in synthetic efforts toward related nitrogen heterocycles.36−39 The allylic amine stereocenters of 4 and 5 could be constructed by a palladium-catalyzed nucleophilic substitution
reaction with concomitant 1,3-transposition from carbonate esters 6. In this reaction, a palladium π-allyl complex generated
from 6 would be trapped by a nitrogen nucleophile at
the distal position, providing the conjugated enoate 4 or 5, depending on the choice of nucleophile. This
reaction would serve as a point of strategic divergence that would
allow synthesis of piperidines and pyrrolidines from similar carbonate
precursors. The stereocenter of 6 could then be established
by an enzyme-controlled hydrocyanation of a requisite α,β-unsaturated
aldehyde (7). The oxynitrilase enzyme is known to accomplish
this transformation in good yield and with largely excellent enantioselectivities.8 Additionally, we felt that any enzyme–substrate
incompatibilities encountered during the syntheses could be surmounted
through olefin cross-metathesis between 7 and the alkene
displaying the conflicting group. Although there have been previous
reports of allylic transposition to convert alcohol to amine stereocenters
in the syntheses of nitrogen heterocycles, we believed our method
would serve as a useful contribution because it is does not rely on
stoichiometric or hazardous reagents, and the enantiopurity is installed
and managed catalytically.40−43

Scheme 1 Retrosynthetic Analysis of (−)-Coniine and
DAB-1
Results and Discussion
The syntheses began with the installation of the first chiral center
by an enzyme-catalyzed hydrocyanation reaction (Scheme 2).44−48 The enzyme oxynitrilase [EC 4.1.2.10],49 found in raw bitter almonds, has been shown to provide cyanohydrins
of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes in good yields with remarkable
enantiopurity.50trans-2-Hexenal (8a) and crotonaldehyde (8b)
are both excellent substrates for this process. Exposure of these
aldehydes to oxynitrilase in the presence of excess HCN furnished
cyanohydrins 7 in good yields and >99% enantiomeric
excess.8 This reaction is particularly
serviceable because of the low cost and ready availability of the
enzyme from store-bought raw almonds, which, after grinding and removal
of fats by extraction, are ready to use in the natural enzymatic matrix.
The conversion of cyanohydrins 7 into their analogous
α-hydroxyesters 9 was conducted under anhydrous
Pinner conditions using TMSCl in ethanol. It is important to stress
that the anhydrous Pinner conditions are compulsory if the erosion
of enantiomeric purity that occurs under aqueous conditions is to
be avoided. This functional group interconversion was necessitated
by our earlier studies that found α,β-unsaturated cyanohydrin
carbonates were poor substrates for stereo-controlled, palladium-catalyzed
allylic substitution reactions. The corresponding ethyl ester carbonates
(6), however, demonstrated excellent stereocontrol.8,51 The more sterically demanding ethyl ester was better suited to attenuate
π–σ–π isomerization of the π-allyl
intermediate that led to competitive formation of the (S)-cis product than the more compact nitrile. Accordingly, α-hydroxyester 9a was converted to carbonate 6a with ethyl chloroformate
without event.8,9

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Building
Blocks Utilizing the Oxynitrilase Enzyme
Our next challenge was to develop optimal conditions for maximum
stereocontrol in the crucial palladium-catalyzed 1,3-chirality transfer
step. Although many methods exist for the 1,3-chirality transfer of
allylic alcohol derivatives,40−43 we believed that the palladium-catalyzed method provides
the greatest flexibility in terms of scope of nucleophile choice and
general mildness of the reaction conditions.52 Of special concern to us were the competing inner- and outer-sphere
nucleophilic addition processes to the cationic palladium π-allyl
intermediate generated by exposure of carbonate 6a to
palladium(0) catalysts (Figure 2). Specifically, amine nucleophiles that react directly with
the chiral π-allyl complex 10a generate C–N
bond formation products ((R)-11) with
a net retention of stereochemistry (pathway A). On the other hand,
Lewis basic amines that are inclined to coordinate to the metal (e.g., 10b) undergo an inner-sphere reductive elimination to give
(S)-11 (pathway B). Products of pathway
B would be delivered with a net inversion of configuration. We understood
that this stereospecificity could be governed by hard–soft
acid base theory, with softer nucleophiles reacting more preferentially
with the π-allyl ligand directly (pathway A) and harder nucleophiles
operating through an inner-sphere process (pathway B).53 It was not clear to us at the outset whether
amines would have the requisite hardness or softness to be selective
for one pathway over the other, and it was thought that judicious
choice of nitrogen-protecting groups could be used to modulate the
stereospecificity.54

Figure 2 Competing π-allyl
addition pathways.

Our initial attempts
at palladium-catalyzed C–N bond formation began with the reaction
between 3-butenylamine and allylic carbonate 6a (Table 1, entry 1). Although
the yield of the resulting allylic amine (12a) was acceptable,
all efforts to improve the stereospecificity of the reaction were
unsuccessful. We, therefore, turned our attention to more highly resonance-stabilized
versions of the 3-butenylamine moiety in order to soften the nucleophile
and promote preferential outer-sphere substitution.53 Although carbamates are significantly more acidified relative
to primary amines, the reduced nucleophilicity of the bulky tert-butyl carbamate-protected 3-butenylamine provided only
trace amounts of C–N bond formation (entry 2). We then further
increased the acidity of the butenyl nitrogen, and therefore its base-mediated
nucleophilicity, by converting it to the corresponding 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonamide
(DNs) using 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride. Upon exposure to
the palladium catalyst in dichloromethane at room temperature, allylic
carbonate 6a and the DNs-derived nucleophile quickly
reacted to form 12c in 80% yield and 80% ee (entry 3).
Although these numbers reflect similar results to those obtained under
analogous conditions in the 3-butenylamine experiment, we found that
the rate of reaction with the DNs-sulfonamide to be superior. We also
looked into alternative ligands for the palladium catalyst, but the
results were disappointing and detrimental to the yields (entries
4 and 5). Ultimately, we found that reducing the reaction temperature
to −10 °C and employing the reactive sulfonamide nucleophile
enabled us to obtain excellent enantiospecificity of 96% with only
a modest reduction in overall yield (entry 6). Any further decrease
in temperature resulted in poor yields (entry 7). We anticipate that
secondary sulfonamides of this type will have broad utility in palladium-catalyzed
allylic substitution reactions where high levels of stereospecificity
are desired. The appeal of this reaction is further enhanced by the
ease of both the synthesis and removal of the DNs group under mildly
nucleophilic conditions.55

With optimized conditions for the
palladium-catalyzed 1,3-chirality transfer in hand, we moved forward
with the completion of the synthesis (Scheme 3). Ring-closing metathesis with the second-generation
Hoveyda–Grubbs catalyst excised the α,β-unsaturated
ester as expected to provide DNs-protected unsaturated piperidine 13. In a single pot, 13 was rapidly deprotected
with excess allyl amine followed by reprotection with Boc2O to afford the corresponding tert-butyl carbamate
(14) in 75% yield. This functional group interconversion
was initiated to avoid difficulties inherent with the purification
and handling of volatile-free amines. Palladium-catalyzed hydrogenation
of the remaining alkene readily yielded Boc-protected coniine 15. Because this intermediate has itself been transformed
into (−)-coniine (1) via acid-mediated removal
of the tert-butyl carbamate,13 this inclusive synthetic effort, leading to (−)-15, represents a formal total synthesis of (−)-coniine (1). The measured optical rotation of 15 ([α]D20 −32.1
(c 0.895, CHCl3)); lit. [α]D23 −31.6
(c 0.86, CHCl3) is in convincing agreement
with the reported value, suggesting a high level of enantiopurity
initially derived from the enzyme-catalyzed hydrocyanation reaction.11

Scheme 3 Piperidine Synthesis by Ring-Closing Metathesis
Our approach to polyhydroxylated iminosugar
DAB-1 (2) required additional considerations to account
for the introduction of the stereodefined dihydroxyl groups and exocyclic
hydroxymethylene functionality. The first challenge could be satisfied
with stereoselective dihydroxylation, but the second one required
more thought. It was decided that a protected version of the hydroxymethylene
group should be incorporated directly into the unsaturated aldehyde
starting material with oxygen substitution in the 4-position. Unfortunately,
early experiments revealed that oxynitrilase was not able to hydrocyanate
aldehydes with tolerable enantioselectivities when adorned with the
requisite oxygen substitution.50 In order
to overcome this complication, we envisioned that a ruthenium-catalyzed
cross-metathesis between a protected allyl alcohol and an enzyme-derived
(R)-(β,γ)-unsaturated-(α)-hydroxyester
should furnish our ideal starting material (Scheme 4). Consequently, we were delighted to find
that the cross-metathesis reaction amongst hydroxyester 9b and allyl benzyl ether supplied the needed alkene 9c in good yield and pleasing trans/cis selectivity. Other partners,
such as allyl acetate, allyl alcohol, or cis-2-butene-1,4-diol
derivatives, were either less efficient or provided unsatisfactory
trans/cis ratios. Although the optimized metathesis reaction leading
to (R)-9c generated a trans/cis ratio
of 95:5, this inseparable material could not be carried forward to
the palladium transposition step. Any cis isomer present would undergo
π–σ–π equilibration of the palladium
π-allyl intermediate, ultimately eroding enantiopurity with
the formation of the undesired enantiomer. Fortunately, the undesired
cis isomer was separable by careful chromatographic purification after
conversion to the carbonate (6b). Palladium-catalyzed
allylic azidation of carbonate 6b was achieved following
our previously reported conditions.8,51 Stereospecificity
in this allylic transposition was high, providing azide 16 in good yield and enantiopurity. This sequence provided the key
amine stereocenter in short order from the enzymatically derived chiral
fragment.

Scheme 4 Catalytic Reactions to Generate the Key Nitrogen Stereocenter
The next stage of the synthesis focused on the
introduction of the two remaining alcohol stereocenters (Scheme 5). Conversion of
azide 16 to carbamate 17 prior to dihydroxylation
was necessary to exert a greater influence on the stereoselectivity
of the crucial dihydroxylation step. Under the standard Upjohn conditions,
however, the diastereoselectivity ratio was a disappointing 1.3:1,
marginally favoring the unwanted diol 19. Fortunately,
dihydroxylation with AD-mix β delivered the desired diastereomer
(18) in good yield and excellent diastereoselectivity
(>20:1 dr).

Scheme 5 Synthesis of Polyhydroxylated Carbamate 18
With all heteroatoms and stereocenters
correctly positioned, completion of the DAB-1 synthesis rested on
three remaining steps: lactam formation, amide reduction, and benzyl
deprotection (Scheme 6). One-pot cyclization of aminoester 18 to lactam diol 20 was efficaciously accomplished in 87% yield via facile
removal of the Boc group followed by a cyanide-catalyzed lactamization.
Reduction of the resultant lactam (20) was achieved under
classic borane-mediated conditions. Finally, deprotection of the benzyl-protecting
group was performed under a hydrogen atmosphere with a 10% loading
of palladium on carbon. We were gratified to discover that this two-step
reaction sequence produced our target molecule, DAB-1 (2), in a 63% yield, isolated as the hydrochloride salt. The observed
optical rotation of synthetic DAB-1 was in good agreement with literature-reported
values.31

Scheme 6 Syntheses of DAB-1
and Nectrisine
Nectrisine, a related
iminosugar with important biological activity, was also accessed from
lactam 20 by a modified procedure. Hydrogenolysis of
the benzyl ether (20) was accomplished to provide lactam
triol 21. This triol is a known intermediate in the synthesis
of nectrisine.34,56 This formal synthesis underscores
the general utility of our route to substituted pyrrolidine alkaloids.

In conclusion, we have developed a novel combined enzyme- and metal-catalyzed
strategy for the enantioselective syntheses of three notable alkaloid
natural products. The inexpensive and readily available oxynitrilase
enzyme introduced the first stereocenter in each instance with remarkable
enantioselectivity. Alkene cross-metathesis proved a resourceful method
to overcome the substrate limitations of the enzyme. Palladium-catalyzed
1,3-allylic substitutive transpositions translated this stereochemistry
into the key amine stereocenters using both azide and novel DNs-protected
nitrogen nucleophiles. This combined strategy provided functionally
dense and stereochemically rich molecular building blocks that were
readily elaborated into (−)-coniine, DAB-1, and nectrisine.
We anticipate that this strategy could be employed as a template for
the synthesis of other piperidine and pyrrolidine alkaloids by taking
advantage of the broad scope of the catalytic reactions described
as well as a source of functionally dense synthetic intermediates.

tert-Butyl (R)-6-Propyl-3,6-dihydropyridine-1(2H)-carboxylate (14)
Allyl amine (0.796
mL; 0.605 g, 10.6 mmol) was added dropwise to an ice-cooled, stirred
solution of the DN-protected piperidine 13 (188 mg, 0.531
mmol) in anhydrous CH2Cl2 (5.3 mL, 0.1 M). After
18 min, the initially red solution had turned orange and was carefully
concentrated in vacuo (approx. 400 Torr) at room temperature to furnish
the volatile dehydroconiine intermediate. To assist in the removal
of the excess allyl amine, the crude product was twice dissolved in
CH2Cl2 (10 mL) and sequentially evaporated as
before. The liquid residue was dissolved in p-dioxane
(4.3 mL) and H2O (5.3 mL) and then treated with NaHCO3 (178 mg, 2.12 mmol) and a solution of Boc2O (347
mg, 1.59 mmol) in p-dioxane (1 mL). After 18.5 h
of stirring at room temperature, the mixture was diluted with EtOAc
(approx. 10 mL) and then quenched by the dropwise addition of H2SO4 (1 M) until the solution reached a pH of 1.
The aqueous layer was separated and extracted three times with EtOAc.
The combined organic extractions were washed with saturated aqueous
NaHCO3 (1 × 10 mL), 0.1 M aqueous NaOH (3 × 10
mL), dried over MgSO4, and rinsed through a short plug
of silica gel (60–200 mesh) and MgSO4. The solution
was concentrated, and the resulting oil was purified on silica gel
using radial chromatography (hexanes/EtOAc, 25:1) to afford 90 mg

dissolved in MeOH (1 mL, 0.08 M), and 10% palladium on carbon (22
mg) was added, followed by a solution of HCl in dioxane (4 M, 5 μL,
0.25 equiv). The atmosphere of the reaction vessel was exchanged for
argon and then for hydrogen by three vacuum-refill cycles. After 17
h, the atmosphere was again exchanged for argon before exposing the
vessel to air. The solution was filtered through a pad of Celite with
excess methanol and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting
oil was dissolved in methanol (5 mL), and HCl in dioxane (4 M, 1 mL)
was added, and the resulting solution was concentrated under reduced
pressure to provide 9 mg (63%) of 2 as pale yellow oil. 1H NMR (300 MHz, D2O): δ 4.06 (dt, J = 5.5, 3.3 Hz, 1H), 3.79 (t, J = 4.1
Hz, 1H), 3.67 (dd, J = 11.8, 5.0 Hz, 1H), 3.56 (dd, J = 11.9, 7.3 Hz, 1H), 3.24–3.09 (m, 2H), 2.93 (dd, J = 12.3, 3.2 Hz, 1H); 13C NMR (75 MHz; D2O): δ 76.6, 75.2, 67.5, 59.9, 50.9; [α]D25 +31.1 (c 0.28, H2O) lit. +33.3 (c 0.18,
H2O). Spectroscopic data were an exact match with that
previously published in the literature.31

(3S,4R,5R)-3,4-Dihydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)pyrrolidin-2-one (21)
Palladium (10%) on carbon (70 mg) and HCl in dioxane (4
M, 5 μL, 0.25 equiv) added to a solution of diol 20 (50 mg, 0.21 mmol, 1 equiv) in methanol (0.5 mL, 0.4 M) in a round
bottom flask equipped with a stir bar. The atmosphere of the flask
was exchanged successively for argon and then for hydrogen by three
vacuum-refill cycles. The reaction mixture was stirred for 17 h before
the atmosphere was exchanged again to argon before the flask was opened
to air. The mixture was filtered through Celite with excess methanol,
and the eluent was concentrated under reduced pressure to provide
30 mg (97%) of triol 21 as colorless oil. 1H NMR (300 MHz, D2O): δ 4.33 (dd, J = 8.0, 1.2 Hz, 1H), 4.03 (t, J = 7.6 Hz, 1H), 3.81
(dd, J = 12.2, 3.1 Hz, 1H), 3.64 (ddd, J = 12.2, 4.9, 1.2 Hz, 1H), 3.53–3.43 (m, 1H); 13C NMR (75 MHz; D2O): δ 178.2, 78.2, 77.2, 62.7,
60.6; FTIR: 3426, 2927, 1740, 1701 cm–1; HRMS: calcd
for C5H9NO4Na ([M + Na]+), 170.0429; found, 170.0430; [α]D25 +10.6 (c 0.63, H2O) lit. +15.4 (c 0.12). Spectroscopic data
were an exact match with that previously published in the literature.34
