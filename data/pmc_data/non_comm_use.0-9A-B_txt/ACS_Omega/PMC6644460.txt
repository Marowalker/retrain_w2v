The mechanisms for the photochemical
isomerization reactions are
determined theoretically using group 6 Fischer carbene complexes (CO)5M=C(Me)(OMe) (M = Cr, Mo, and W) and the complete-active-space
self-consistent field (CASSCF) (10-orbital/8-electron active space)
and second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation (MP2-CAS)
methods with the Def2-SVPD basis set. The structures and energies
of the singlet/singlet conical intersections and the triplet/singlet
intersystem crossings, which play a decisive role in these photoisomerizations,
are determined. The former is applied to the chromium and molybdenum
systems because their photoproducts are essentially from the singlet
excited states. The latter is applied to the tungsten complex because
its photoproducts are formed from a low-lying triplet excited state.
Two reaction pathways are examined in this work: photocarbonylation
(path I) and CO-photoextrusion (path II). The model studies strongly
indicate that in the photochemistry of Cr and Mo Fischer carbene systems,
the formation of metallaketene intermediates may occur at higher excitation
wavenumbers, whereas the five-coordinated complexes that are attached
by a solvent molecule are obtained at lower excitation wavenumbers.
However, in the W analogue, because the activation barriers for path
I are greater than that for path II and path I has more reaction steps
than path II, the quantum yields for the metallaketene intermediate
should be smaller than those for the five-coordinated species, which
is also attached by a solvent molecule. These theoretical studies
also suggest that the conical intersection and the spin crossover
mechanisms that are identified in this work explain the process well
and support the experimental observations.

1 Introduction
Fischer
carbene complexes of the type (CO)5M=C(R1)(R2) (R1 and R2 = alkyl,
alkoxy, amino, etc.),1 which have a double
bond between the transition metal (M) and the carbene carbon, have
been extensively studied as reagents for use in various organic syntheses2−11 and in organometallic chemistry.12−17 Their vigorous reactivity means that many generations of chemists
have searched for new chemical reactions and further synthetic applications
in the fields of both thermal chemistry and photochemistry.18,19 However, many reaction mechanisms that involve these Fischer carbene
complexes with different transition metal elements still remain undiscovered.18,19

The pioneering work of McGuire and Hegedus in 198220−23 demonstrated that chromium Fischer carbene complexes react with
imines under visible light to yield β-lactams, which are at the origin of a famous reaction in organometallic chemistry.24−34 Hegedus and co-workers proposed that irradiation by sunlight facilitates the insertion
of one of the five CO ligands into the metal–carbene–carbon
double bond, which produces either a short-lived metallacyclopropanone
(I) or a metallaketene (II) intermediate that, respectively, has one
or no bridging carbonyl groups, as illustrated in Scheme 1.6,24−34,36,37 Although these two structures characterize various spectroscopic
properties,35 the role that they play in
these photochemical mechanisms of Fischer carbene complexes is uncertain
because the existence of either (I) or (II) intermediate had not been
experimentally confirmed by any laboratories for a very long time.24−34,36−42 However, until 2014, Harris and co-workers used ultrafast time-resolved
infrared spectroscopy (TRIR) to study both photophysics and the photochemistry
of (CO)5Cr=C(OMe)(Me) (Rea-Cr-S0) and (CO)5W=C(OMe)(Me) (Rea-W-S0) in cyclohexane.43 It was reported that the photoexcitation of Rea-Cr-S0 results in the rapid generation
of both singlet and triplet “Cr–ketene” structures,
whereas picosecond TRIR (psTRIR) of Rea-W-S0 gives no experimental evidence for the formation of
the “W–ketene” intermediate.43 These experimental results seemed to support the earlier
study of Sierra, Cossío, and co-workers.38−42 In 2015, Pryce and co-workers used psTRIR and low-temperature
matrix isolation to study these molecules and detected no triplet
states for the case of the Rea-Cr-S0 complex.44,45 That is to say, upon excitation
of Rea-Cr-S0 at 400 nm, the Cr–ketene
product (Pro1-Cr-S0) is produced
predominantly from the electronically excited Rea-Cr-S0 (Int1-Cr-S1) and a Cr-cyclopropanone species (Int2-Cr-S1) on a singlet excited state (the asterisk represents
an excited state) (see Scheme 2).44,45 In particular, Pryce and co-workers44,45 verified the findings of Hegedus and co-workers in 1988,24 which showed that the metallaketene
(II) originates from a singlet excited state and then plays an intermediate
role in the photochemical reactions of Fischer carbene complexes to
generate β-lactams, β-lactones, and other organic products.2−11 It was also found that 320 nm excitation of Rea-Cr-S0 results in the CO-loss product (Pro2-Cr-S0), as shown in Scheme 2.44,45 In contrast to the
Cr system, following both 400 and 320 nm excitation, the singlet ground
state W–ketene product (Pro1-W-S0) is experimentally observed because of the intersystem crossing
of the triplet state (Int1-W-T1 and Int2-W-T1) to the ground-state
singlet hypersurface, which is shown in Scheme 3.39,44

These interesting experimental results prompt this investigation
of mechanisms for the photoisomerization reactions of Fischer carbenes
of the type ((CO)5M=C(OMe)(Me)), which feature group
6 transition metal elements (M = Cr, Mo, and W). There have been few
theoretical investigations of the photochemical carbonylation of group
6 Fischer carbene complexes. To the best of the author’s knowledge,
only three papers have reported photochemical mechanisms for group
6 Fischer carbene complexes using experimental procedures and computational
methods.38,43,44

Sierra,
Cossío, and co-workers studied the photocarbonylation
of Cr- and W-Fischer carbene molecules and proposed that the photoreactivity
of group 6 Fischer carbene compounds is strongly related to the coordinating
ability of the solvent.38 Harris and co-workers
proved the presence of Cr–ketene intermediates using psTRIR
spectroscopy and density functional theory, but no W–ketene
analogue was experimentally observed during any part of photochemical
carbonylation reaction and no theoretical studies have been performed
for the tungsten-Fischer carbene counterparts.43

Pryce and co-workers used time-dependent density
functional calculations
to determine the possible photochemical mechanisms for the Cr- and
W-Fischer carbene complexes.44,45 However, none of these
theoretical studies fully consider the reaction pathways from the
excited state to the ground state when the Fischer carbenes are irradiated
by visible light. In particular, as already mentioned in Scheme 2, Pryce et al. proved
that for the Cr Fischer carbene complex, the metallaketene (II) species
originates from a singlet excited state.44,45 Pryce et al. also found that the lowest energy triplet state plays
a decisive role in the photochemistry of the W-Fischer carbene compound.44,46−48 The reason for this could be due to the fact that
the large spin–orbit coupling (SOC) for tungsten compared to
chromium and molybdenum can assist the direct population of triplet
states.

Therefore, scrutiny of the mechanisms of such photoisomerization
reactions requires a more sophisticated quantum chemical theory.

To gain a better understanding of the energy hypersurfaces of the
excited states of group 6 Fischer carbene complexes, this study performs
a theoretical investigation of the photoisomerizations of (CO)5Cr=C(OMe)(Me) (Rea-Cr-S0), (CO)5Mo=C(OMe)(Me) (Rea-Mo-S0), and (CO)5W=C(OMe)(Me)
(Rea-W-S0). Information about
the photochemical reaction behavior of group 6 Fischer carbene molecules
allows better control of the results of these photoreactions and allows
further organic as well as organometallic syntheses.

2 General Considerations
As mentioned in the Introduction, there
are two possible reaction pathways for the photoisomerization reactions
of group 6 Fischer carbenes (CO)5M=C(Me)(OMe) (M
= Cr, Mo and W): path I (photocarbonylation) and path II (CO-photoextrusion),
which, respectively, lead to the metallaketene intermediate (II, Pro1) and the five-coordinated square pyramid species (Pro2), as schematically illustrated in Scheme 4. The channel from the excited-state surface
to the ground-state surface, which corresponds to either a conical
intersection (S1 → S0) or an intersystem
crossing (T1 → S0),49−54 is described in terms of these reaction routes in the following
section.

Scheme 4 Proposed Mechanisms for Photocarboxylation Reactions of Fischer
Carbenes
3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Singlet Photochemical Reaction
Mechanisms
of (CO)5Cr=C(OMe)(Me)
The photoisomerizations
of the Cr Fischer carbene complex, (CO)5Cr=C(OMe)(Me)
(Rea-Cr-S0), are first considered. Figure 1 shows the reaction
profiles that are calculated for both of the reaction pathways in Scheme 4 and the relative
energies of the various points with respect to the energy of the corresponding
reactant (Rea-Cr-S0). Selected
geometrical parameters for all of the stationary points on the photoreaction
pathways of Rea-Cr-S0, using
CAS(8,10)/Def2-SVPD calculations, are given in Figure 2.

Figure 1 Energy profiles for the photochemical reactions
of (CO)5Cr=C(Me)(OMe) (Rea-Cr-S0). The abbreviations, FC, Int, TS, CI, and Pro,
respectively, stand
for Franck–Condon, intermediate, transition state, conical
intersection, and product. The relative energies are calculated at
the MP2-CAS-(8,10)/Def2-SVPD//CAS(8,10)/Def2-SVPD level of theory.
All energies (in kcal/mol) are given with respect to the reactant, Rea-Cr-S0. Figure 2 shows the CAS-optimized structures for the
crucial points. For more information, see the text.

difference vectors for the conical intersections, which are calculated
using the CAS method, are shown in square brackets. The bold arrows
indicate the principal atomic motions in the transition-state eigenvector.
For clarity, hydrogen atoms are omitted. For more details, see the Supporting Information.

When the reactant (Rea-Cr-S0) is irradiated, it is initially promoted to its excited state
by
a vertical excitation. The CAS(8,10)/Def2-SVPD calculation for Rea-Cr-S0 predicts that the first
excited state for this Cr species is the lowest-lying singlet state
(S1), as shown on the left-hand side of Figure 1. This point on the excited
singlet surface is shown as FC-Cr-S1 (S1 (S0 geom)) and its vertical excitation
energy is estimated to be 70 kcal/mol (S0 → S1 (S0 geom)). The available experimental data give
a value of 400 nm (=72 kcal/mol in energy);18−45 so, it is theoretically predicted that the Rea-Cr-S0 reactant is situated on the singlet surface,
after the vertical photoexcitation, which has been confirmed by the
recent experimental work.44,45

For path I (photocarbonylation), Figure 1 shows that from
the FC point (FC-Cr-S1), the
Cr Fischer carbene relaxes to a local
minimum (Int1-Cr-S1) at the singlet
first excited state. Int1-Cr-S1 then goes to a transition state, TS1-Cr-S1, in which one carbonyl group bends toward the carbene
ligand, followed by the formation of a three-membered-ring intermediate, Int2-Cr-S1. The fully optimized structures
for Int1-Cr-S1 and Int2-Cr-S1 are given in Figure 2. It is seen that the molecule in Int1-Cr-S1 has an octahedral structure, whereas the
pattern of Int2-Cr-S1 is quite
similar to the metallacyclopropanone (I), as already shown in Scheme 1. The absorptions
that are the result of CO ligands in the two intermediates (Int1-Cr-S1 and Int2-Cr-S1) are detailed in Table S1 (Supporting Information). The calculated frequencies
at the complete-active-space self-consistent field (CASSCF) level
of theory for Int1-Cr-S1 and Int2-Cr-S1 are 1966 and 1764 cm–1, respectively. These values are in reasonable agreement
with the experimentally reported absorptions at 1970 and 1770 cm–1.44 The agreement between
these theoretical findings and the available experimental observations44 of the Cr species is the convincing proof that
the computational method that is used in this study provides a reliable
basis for any discussion of the photochemical reaction mechanisms
for the Fischer carbene complexes, for which the experimental data
are still either scarce or non-existent.

Figure 1 shows that
the Int2-Cr-S1 intermediate subsequently
undergoes a Cr–carbene bond breaking via a transition state TS2-Cr-S1. Figure 2 shows that TS2-Cr-S1 connects the singlet local minimum Int2-Cr-S1 and the corresponding conical intersection
point, CI-Cr-1. The orientation of the two vectors (i.e.,
the gradient difference and the derivative coupling vectors), computed
at CAS(8,10), is also shown schematically in Figure 2. The gradient difference vector for CI-Cr-1 corresponds to a Cr–C–O bending motion,
which can result in a vibrationally hot species at the singlet ground-state
configuration. However, by following the derivative coupling vector
for CI-Cr-1 and increasing the Cr–C(Me)(OMe) bond
distance, the system can arrive at a final product, Pro1-Cr-S0, whose geometrical structure is shown in Figure 2 and which is analogous
to the metallaketene (II) (Scheme 1). The second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation
theory (MP2-CAS) results show that the relative energy differences
for Int1-Cr-S1, TS1-Cr-S1, Int2-Cr-S1, TS2-Cr-S1, CI-Cr-1, and Pro1-Cr-S0 with respect
to that of Rea-Cr-S0 are 45,
56, 39, 51, 47, and 21 kcal/mol, respectively. This computational
data strongly imply that when Rea-Cr-S0 is photoirradiated at 400 nm, both singlet-excited intermediates
(Int1-Cr-S1 and Int2-Cr-S1) are kinetically unstable and rearrange
spontaneously to give the more stable product, Pro1-Cr-S0, and the initial reactant, Rea-Cr-S0. These predictions are in good agreement
with the experimental observations, as illustrated in Scheme 2.44 The theoretical evidence for path I that is shown in Figure 1 means that the photocarbonylation
reaction mechanisms for the Cr Fischer carbene can be represented
as follows:  

For path II (CO-photoextrusion), Figure 1 shows that after
the reactant, Rea-Cr-S0, is irradiated
to the singlet FC point
(FC-Cr-S1), this molecule relaxes
to a conical intersection (CI-Cr-2), from which the photoexcited
compound decays nonradiatively to S0. Again, funneling
through CI-Cr-2 can lead to two different reaction paths
on the ground-state surface, via either the gradient difference vector
or the derivative coupling vector, as shown in Figure 2. The former results in a vibrationally hot
molecule at the singlet ground state, and the latter corresponds to
an extrusion of one carbonyl group in the (CO)5Cr=C(OMe)(Me)
system, which leads to the CO-loss product, Pro2-Cr-S0.

The MP2-CAS calculations show that
the CI-Cr-2 is
higher in energy than the corresponding Rea-Cr-S0 by about 82 kcal/mol. According to the recent
experimental work by Pryce and co-workers,44,45 following 320 nm (89 kcal/mol) excitation of (CO)5Cr=C(OMe)(Me),
a singlet-ground-state CO-loss product (Pro2-Cr-S0) is obtained. The IR frequencies for this CO-loss
product are at 2043 and 1896 cm–1,44 which is in line with the CAS(8,10) computational results
of 2048 and 1901 cm–1, as shown in Table S1 (Supporting Information). This theoretical finding
strongly suggests that when the reactant (Rea-Cr-S0) is irradiated at 320 nm, the system proceeds
to one-CO-extrusion reaction without any difficulty, as shown in Figure 1. The photochemical
CO-extrusion mechanism for Rea-Cr-S0 is described as follows  

In brief, this theoretical study readily
shows that an understanding
of the conical intersection of the chromium Fischer carbene complexes
is necessary to interpret its reaction mechanism because it is the
driving force for its photochemistry. That is to say, when a Cr Fischer
carbene (Rea-Cr-S0) is vertically
excited to the S1 state, it can proceed along two types
of reaction pathways. On path I, this singlet excited species encounters
two local intermediates, one of which (Int2-Cr-S1) is the three-membered-ring metallacyclopropanone
(I) species. Following a conical intersection, the system then reaches
the final photoproduct (Pro1-Cr-S0) with the metallaketene (II) pattern. On path II, radiation-less
decay from S1 to S0 of a Cr Fischer carbene
(Rea-Cr-S0) occurs via a conical
intersection (CI-Cr-2), which results in a CO-loss product
(Pro2-Cr-S0). More importantly,
starting from these conical intersections, the products of the photoisomerization
(path I) and the photoextrusion (path II), as well as the initial
reactant, are reached along a barrier-less ground-state relaxation
path. All of these theoretical observations for the photochemical
reactions of a Cr Fischer carbene complex agree satisfactorily with
the recent experimental results.44,45

3.2 Singlet Photochemical Reaction Mechanisms
of (CO)5Mo=C(OMe)(Me)
The photochemical
reactions of the molybdenum Fischer carbene complex, (CO)5Mo=C(OMe)(Me) (Rea-Mo-S0), are studied. To the author’s best knowledge, no detailed
photoinduced reactions for the transition-metal complexes of Mo have
been experimentally studied.36,37 To comprehend the SOC
between the ground state and the first excited state for the complexes
studied in this work, the CAS(8,10)/Def2-SVPD method is utilized to
investigate the SOC of (CO)5Cr=C(OMe)(Me) (Rea-Cr-S0), (CO)5Mo=C(OMe)(Me) (Rea-Mo-S0), and (CO)5W=C(OMe)(Me) (Rea-Mo-S0). The computational results
demonstrate FC-Cr-S1 (2.5 cm–1) < FC-Mo-S1 (6.1 cm–1) < FC-W-S1 (219.3 cm–1) and FC-Cr-T1 (67.2 cm–1) < FC-Mo-T1 (106.8 cm–1) < FC-W-T1 (227.5 cm–1). Apparently, the theoretical lines of evidence reveal
that the SOC values increase in the order: Cr < Mo ≪ W.
As a result, it is reasonable to directly populate singlet excited
states from the singlet ground state for the Mo complexes. The singlet
surfaces for the Mo Fischer carbene complex are the focus of this
study hereafter. Figure 3 shows the relative energies on the singlet potential energy surface
along the presumed photoisomerization pathways from Rea-Mo-S0 to different photoproducts (path I and
path II). The main geometrical parameters for the critical points
on both pathways are shown in Figure 4.

stand
for Franck–Condon, intermediate, transition state, conical
intersection, and product. The relative energies are calculated at
the MP2-CAS-(8,10)/Def2-SVPD//CAS(8,10)/Def2-SVPD level of theory.
All energies (in kcal/mol) are given with respect to the reactant, Rea-Mo-S0. Figure 4 shows the CAS-optimized structures for the
crucial points. For more information, see the text.

path I and

difference vectors for conical intersections, which are calculated
using the CAS method, are shown in square brackets. The bold arrows
indicate the principal atomic motions in the transition-state eigenvector.
For clarity, hydrogen atoms are omitted. For more details, see the Supporting Information.

The reaction profiles that are calculated for Rea-Mo-S0 resemble that of Rea-Cr-S0, as shown in Figure 3. That is, starting from the Mo reactant
and going to the Franck-Condon point FC-Mo-S1, the photoisomerization reactions on the singlet excited-state
energy surface can take two different reaction routes (Scheme 4): path I (photocarbonylation)
and path II (CO-photoextrusion). The computational results that are
schematically shown in Figure 3 indicate that these two reaction pathways for the Mo Fischer
carbene complex proceed as follows    

For path I, the CAS-MP2 calculations
show that the energies of Int1-Mo-S1, TS1-Mo-S1, Int2-Mo-S1, TS2-Mo-S1, CI-Mo-1, and Pro1-Mo-S0 relative to
the ground-state minimum (Rea-Mo-S0) are 42, 52, 38, 54, 43, and 23 kcal/mol and are lower than
that of FC-Mo-S1 by 26, 16, 30,
14, 25, and 45 kcal/mol. Because of the additional energy (68 kcal/mol)
generated by decay from Rea-Mo-S0 to FC-Mo-S1, it is anticipated
that this relaxation energy is sufficient to induce an efficient photocarbonylation
reaction (path I) for the Mo Fischer carbene complex. These theoretical
lines of evidence are in good agreement with the available experimental
reports.26,29,30 Additionally,
the theoretical evidence demonstrates that when Rea-Mo-S0 is irradiated with visible light at 400
nm (=72 kcal/mol), one CO ligand is inserted into the Mo–C(Me)(OMe)
bond to form a metallacyclopropanone (I; Int2-Mo-S1). This intermediate subsequently leads to a
real conical intersection (CI-Mo-1), at which the decay
to either a metallaketene II (Pro1-Mo-S0) or an initial reactant on the ground-state surface occurs
within a single vibrational period,49−54 so it follows a concerted pathway. The calculated CO stretching
frequencies for the minima, Rea-Mo-S0, Int1-Mo-S1, Int2-Mo-S1, and Pro1-Mo-S0, are all listed in Table S1 (Supporting Information). Unfortunately, as mentioned earlier, owing to
a lack of experimental data for these Mo Fischer carbene complexes,
the vibrational frequencies that are given in this study must be considered
as predictions for future studies.

For path II, the theoretical
results that are shown in Figure 3 suggest that CI-Mo-2 is 11 kcal/mol higher
in energy than FC-Mo-S1 and 79
kcal/mol higher in energy than the
ground-state reactant Rea-Mo-S0; so, it is expected that a CO-loss product, Pro2-Mo-S0, cannot be formed during the irradiation
of Rea-Mo-S0 with 400 nm (=72
kcal/mol) light because the singlet excited energy of Rea-Mo-S0 (68 kcal/mol) is insufficient to yield
it via radiation-less decay (i.e., the conical intersection channel).
However, spectroscopic changes are observed following 320 nm (=89
kcal/mol) excitation of Rea-Mo-S0, as shown in Figure 3. The CO stretching frequencies for this CO-loss product (Pro2-Mo-S0) are listed in Table S1 (Supporting Information). However, the absence of related experimental
and theoretical studies of the Mo Fischer carbene complexes means
that these vibrational frequencies for the Pro2-Mo-S0 species are predictions.

In this study
of the chromium and molybdenum Fischer carbene systems,
the CAS-MP2 computations demonstrate that if both Cr and Mo Fischer
carbene complexes are irradiated, two types of photointermediates, Pro1-M-S0 (a metallaketene) and Pro2-M-S0 (a square pyramidal structure),
are produced. Because path II undergoes the CO-photoextrusion process,
the final intermediate, Pro2-M-S0, features a five-coordinated square-pyramidal geometry. This unstable
intermediate must quickly attach to a solvent molecule to form a stable
six-coordinated octahedral structure (Scheme 5). Therefore, it would be difficult to verify
these five-coordinated species experimentally. Their further study
is beyond the scope of this work.

3.3 Triplet
Photochemical Reaction Mechanisms
of (CO)5W=C(OMe)(Me)
For the purpose of
comparison, the triplet photoisomerization reactions of tungsten Fischer
carbene complex, (CO)5W=C(OMe)(Me) (Rea-W-S0), are studied.44 As demonstrated in the previous section, because the SOC data increase
in the order: Cr < Mo ≪ W, one may consider the Rea-W-S0 complex to occupy triplet states directly
from the singlet ground state, unlike the other two complexes (Rea-Cr-S0 and Rea-Mo-S0).55 In other
words, the intersystem crossing pathways are used to examine both
the singlet and triplet potential energy surfaces for (CO)5W=C(OMe)(Me). The reason for this is simply because the present
investigations want to resolve how this reactant initiates on an excited
electronic potential surface and then crosses over to a lower surface
somewhere along the reaction pathway. The photochemical reaction pathways
that correspond to a photocarbonylation mechanism (path I) and a CO-photoextrusion
mechanism (path II) shown in Scheme 4 are studied. The discussion of these two reaction
pathways is based on 10 fully optimized structures that correspond
to minima, transition states, and intersystem crossing points on the
S0 and T1 state energy surfaces. A schematic
overview of the computed energy profile for the photochemical reaction
routes for Rea-W-S0 is shown
in Figure 5. The structures
optimized at the CAS(8,10)/Def2-SVPD level of theory are outlined
in Figure 6.

intersection, and product. The relative energies are calculated at

All energies (in kcal/mol) are given with respect to the reactant, Rea-W-S0. Figure 6 shows the CAS-optimized structures for the
crucial points. For more information, see the text.

difference vectors for conical intersections, which are calculated
using the CAS method, are shown in square brackets. The bold arrows
indicate the principal atomic motions in the transition-state eigenvector.
For clarity, the hydrogen atoms are omitted. For more details, see
the Supporting Information.

As mentioned briefly in Scheme 3, when the reactant, Rea-W-S0, absorbs light, most likely the excitation
leads to
a singlet excited state. That is to say, the present computational
data at the MP2-CAS(8,10)/Def2-SVPD//CAS(8,10)/Def2-SVPD level of
theory anticipate that the triplet excited-state energy (kcal/mol)
at the Franck–Condon geometry for Rea-W-S0 is FC-W-T1 (61.0), FC-W-T2 (67.6), FC-W-T3 (98.1), and FC-W-T4 (100.4), while the singlet excited-state
energy (kcal/mol) at the Franck–Condon geometry is FC-W-S1 (70.4), FC-W-S2 (87.4), and FC-W-S3 (99.5).
In other words, the photoexcitation should promote Rea-W-S0 to a singlet excited state (S1 or S2). Then, this species decays to the triplet state, Int1-W-T1, and the W Fischer carbene
complex relaxes to one intermediate at the lowest-lying triplet state
(Figure 5), which has
an octahedral geometrical structure, as shown in Figure 6, and is named Int1-W-T1. From this intermediate, the search for
a transition state uses the model of its local minimum conformation
at the triplet state. The photochemical isomerization reactions for
the tungsten Fischer carbene complex originate from the excited triplet
surface and eventually advance along the singlet ground-state path.
Therefore, the spin intersystem crossing between the triplet (T1) and singlet (S0) surfaces must play a prominent
role in characterizing the mechanistic photoinduced reactions of Fischer
carbene (CO)5W=C(Me)(OMe) species.

I, similarly to the Cr and Mo cases, the W molecule may
start from Int1-W-T1 and then
undergo the insertion of one CO ligand into the W–C(Me)(OMe)
bond to form a three-membered-ring intermediate, Int2-W-T1, via a transition state, TS1-W-T1. As shown in Figure 6, this intermediate is geometrically structurally
analogous to metallacyclopropanone (I). Subsequently, a W–(MeO)(Me)C1 bond breaking occurs via another transition state, TS2-W-T1, which adopts a metal-ketene-like
conformation whereby two unpaired electrons are located on two different
atoms (W and C1), as shown in Figure 6. Following the intersystem crossing point
(T1/S0-W-1), the W system finally produces a
photoproduct, Pro1-W-S0, with
a metallaketene (II) geometrical structure, as shown in Scheme 1. The CAS-MP2 computations
show that the energies of these stationary points, that is, Int1-W-T1, TS1-W-T1, Int2-W-T1, TS2-W-T1, T1/S0-W-1, and Pro1-W-S0,
are all lower in energy than the FC point (FC-W-T1) by 27, 8.4, 18, 4.3, 9.2, and 31 kcal/mol,
respectively. This theoretical finding strongly suggests that when
the W Fischer carbene complex absorbs visible light (400 nm), it can
undergo the insertion of a CO ligand into the W–C(Me)(OMe)
bond via an intersystem crossing process to produce a metallaketene.
The CAS(8,10) computations also predict the CO stretching frequencies
for Int1-W-T1, Int2-W-T1, and Pro1-W-S0, and these are listed in Table S1. The recent experimental study by Pryce et al. found that the absorptions
for these three species are Int1-W-T1 (1960 cm–1), Int2-W-T1 (1920 cm–1), and Pro1-W-S0 (1945 cm–1).44 These experimentally detected values are in
excellent agreement with the calculated frequencies: Int1-W-T1 (1956 cm–1), Int2-W-T1 (1929 cm–1), and Pro1-W-S0 (1941 cm–1). These are shown in Table S1 (Supporting Information).

On the basis of the reaction profiles that are shown in Figure 5, it is obvious that
upon irradiation with visible light, the photoactivated Rea-W-S0 molecule has sufficient internal energy
(400 nm = 72 kcal/mol) to overcome the energy barriers from Int1-W-T1 to Int2-W-T1 and from Int2-W-T1 to the T1/S0-W-1 crossover points.
The mechanism for the triplet photocarbonylation of W Fischer carbene
(Rea-W-S0) is represented below.  

On path II, the reaction
proceeds when a W–CO bond between
the W and C2 atoms breaks via a transition state, TS3-W-T1. Figure 5 shows that the W system undergoes a W–CO
bond breaking to proceed to the T1/S0-M-2 intersection
point, which has a square-pyramidal structure wherein two unpaired
electrons are located on the W and C2 atoms. These two
unpaired electrons are apparently sufficiently distant that their
singlet and triplet states are degenerate. The T1 and S0 surfaces can therefore cross. Both the optimized structure
and the gradient difference vector for the T1/S0-W-2 species at these points are shown in Figure 6. The CAS-MP2 computations demonstrate that
the formation of T1/S0-W-2 from Int1-W-T1 proceeds via a transition state, TS3-W-T1, with a barrier of 15 kcal/mol.
In short, the mechanism for triplet photoextrusion of Rea-W-S0 is described as follows:  

The reaction profiles
in Figure 5 clearly
show that the W Fischer carbene complex has
sufficient internal energy (72 kcal/mol) to overcome the barrier heights,
after photoexcitation to the T1 state. However, because
the activation barriers (19 and 14 kcal/mol) for path I are somewhat
larger than that for path II (15 kcal/mol) and path I has more reaction
steps than path II, the quantum yield of path I is anticipated to
be smaller than that of path II. In other words, this theoretical
study shows that path I is the unfavorable reaction route from a kinetic
viewpoint. It has been experimentally confirmed that the W Fischer
carbene complex usually does not exhibit any spectroscopic evidence
for the existence of metal ketene intermediates,18−43 except for the works of Pryce et al. (Scheme 3)44 and Sierra,
Cossío, and co-workers.39 In addition,
the theoretical results of the CAS-MP2 calculations predict that a
prototypical tungsten Fischer carbene complex generates a five-coordinated Pro2-W-S0 species that is added to
one solvent molecule to form a six-coordinated product (Scheme 5). However, this theoretical
prediction requires experimental verification.

As already described
in Scheme 3, Pryce
et al. and Sierra, Cossío, and co-workers
reported that the irradiation of the Rea-W-S0 reactant at 400 nm can lead to the formation of Pro1-W-S0,39,44 the structure of which corresponds to the metallaketene (I) (Scheme 1) type. Figure 5 shows that the appropriate
photoexcitation of W Fischer carbene complexes results in both the
photoinduced products: Pro1-W-S0 and Pro2-W-S0. Pryce et al.
also reported that following excitation of Rea-W-S0 using 320 nm light, the spectral changes are
essentially identical to those that occur following excitation at
400 nm, which are shown in Scheme 3.44 In other words, it was
concluded that the photochemistry of Rea-W-S0 is essentially independent of the excitation wavelength.44 The theoretical evidence that is shown in Figure 5 confirms these experimental
observations.44

4 Conclusions
This study gives detail to the standard model for the photoexcitation
reactions of group 6 Fischer carbene complexes and also provides theoretical
explanations for the experimental results.18−45 Initially, Rea-M-S0 (M = Cr
and Mo) and Rea-W-S0 complexes
are vertically excited to the S1 and T1 states
and then, respectively, decay to the singlet and triplet local minima, Int1-M-S1 and Int1-W-T1. Two types of radiation-less decay from
either S1 to S0 or T1 to S0 then occur via either conical intersections (CI-M-1 and CI-M-2) or intersystem crossings (T1/S0-W-1 and T1/S0-W-2). Finally, these
can result in either metal-ketene (Pro1-M-S0) or CO-release (Pro2-M-S0) intermediates. The two types of short-lived intermediates
that are generated are grouped according to the 1,2-biradical intermediates
(Int1-M-S1 and Int2-M-S1 or Int1-W-T1 and Int2-W-T1) that arise
when the metal and carbon bonds are cleaved, as shown in Figures 2, 4, and 6.

In particular, this
theoretical investigation shows that in both
Cr and Mo Fischer carbene complexes, the relative energy for the CO-photoextrusion
reaction (path II) is essentially greater than that for the photocarbonylation
reaction (path I). Therefore, the metallaketene photoproduct should
be observed at high excitation wavelengths, and the five-coordinated
square pyramid species should be obtained at lower excitation wavelengths.
However, for the W Fischer carbene complex, the theoretical computations
demonstrate that the barrier heights for the photocarbonylation reaction
(path I) are higher than that for the CO-photoextrusion reaction (path
II) and the former has more reaction steps than the latter, so it
is predicted that both reaction pathways compete and that the quantum
yield for the former is smaller than that for the latter. These theoretical
investigations from the point of view of conical intersections and
spin crossover allow a better understanding of the photochemical reactions
for group 6 Fischer carbene complexes and support the available experimental
observations.

5 Methodology
All
geometries reported herein are fully optimized, without imposing
any symmetry constraints, using the ab initio CASSCF program released
in Gaussian 09.56 In the study of the photochemical
reaction routes, the stationary point structures on the S0 and S1 (for Rea-Cr-S0 and Rea-Mo-S0 molecules) and
the S0 and T1 (for Rea-W-S0 molecule) surfaces are optimized at the CASSCF
level of computation, using the Def2-SVPD basis set.57

The active space that is required to describe the
ground and the
lowest excited states of Rea-Cr-S0, Rea-Mo-S0, and Rea-W-S0 contains 8 electrons in 10 metal d (bonding
and antibonding) orbitals,58 which is referred
to as CAS(8,10). Therefore, the state-averaged CAS(8,10) method is
used in this work to determine the stationary points on the intersection
space. Frequency calculations at the CAS(8,10)/Def2-SVPD level are
used to compute all stationary points as either minima [the number
of imaginary frequencies (NIMAG) = 0] or transition states (NIMAG
= 1). Optimization occurs when the maximum force and its root mean
square are, respectively, less than 0.00065 and 0.00005 hartree/bohr.

To reform the energies for dynamic electron correlation, the multireference
Møller–Plesset (MP2-CAS) algorithm,59 which is implemented in the Gaussian 09 program package,56 is used. Unless otherwise indicated, the relative
energies that are given in the text are computed at the MP2-CAS(8,10)/Def2-SVPD
level, using the CAS(8,10)/Def2-SVPD (hereafter marked MP2-CAS and
CASSCF, respectively) geometry. The Cartesian coordinates (CASSCF)
and the energies (MP2-CAS and CASSCF) are given in the Supporting Information.
