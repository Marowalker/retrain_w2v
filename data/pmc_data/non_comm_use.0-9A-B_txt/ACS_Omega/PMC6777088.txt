Consumption of cannabis by nontraditional
methods has surged since
the advent of legalization in North America and worldwide. Inhaling
cannabis extracts using vaporizers and via dabbing has risen in popularity,
while concerns over product safety have not hindered their proliferation.
The work herein is the first step toward assessing the safety of vaporizing
and dabbing concentrated cannabis extracts as a function of gas-phase
reaction products. The gas-phase thermal degradants of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) have not been previously investigated.
It was found that users may be exposed to concerning degradants such
as methacrolein, benzene, and methyl vinyl ketone when using cartridge
vaporizers and dabbing. It was shown that THC alone and mixed with
terpenes generated similar degradation products and, most notably,
elevated levels of isoprene. Importantly, it was shown that added
terpenes led to higher levels of gas-phase products compared to THC
alone. To estimate cancer and noncancer risks associated with exposure
to these and other degradants, quantitative risk assessment was applied
to experimentally determined values for dabbing and vaping and literature-sourced
levels of hazardous components in cannabis smoke. Overall, gas-phase
aerosol products had significantly lower values in dabbing and vaporizing
compared to cannabis smoking, although these results should be interpreted
in light of potential variations in degradant levels due to disparate
usage patterns and the dangers of the higher aerosol concentration
of THC.

Introduction
Legalization and increasing
social acceptance of cannabis in the
United States and worldwide has led to a proliferation of novel cannabis
administration methods. Advancement of cannabis extract (CE) production
and processing has placed these at the forefront of novel cannabis
inhalation methods, and sales of CEs now make up more than 20% of
the retail market share in the Washington state.1 Despite their popularity, little work has been done to
assess the safety of these novel consumption methods.

Cannabinoids,
the constituents responsible for cannabis’
psychoactive and medicinal effects, are biosynthesized in trichomes
of female cannabis inflorescences.2−4Figure 1 displays the pharmacologically active cannabinoids
THC (mp: <25 °C5) and cannabidiol
(CBD, mp: 62–63 °C6), which
are biosynthesized as the acid cannabinoids Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinolic
acid (THCA, mp 75 ± 3 °C7) and
cannabidiolic acid (CBDA, mp 68 ± 3 °C8) that readily decarboxylate upon heating.9 Nonpolar solvents (e.g., butane10−12 and supercritical
CO213,14) are used to extract acid cannabinoids
in an oleoresin that includes terpenes, waxes, fatty acids, steroids,
lignins, etc.15 While butane hash oil (BHO,
an amber or gold solid10,16) contains primarily acid cannabinoids,10,11 superfluid cannabis extract (SFE) may contain acid or neutral cannabinoids
depending on processing methods. Vacuum distillation affords purified
neutral cannabinoids allowing manufacturers to tailor cannabinoid
and terpene content in the final product commonly referred to as a
distillate.17 Distillates are often amended
with terpenes at 5–15% (m/m).18

Figure 1 Relevant
cannabinoids.

Three consumption methods/devices
for CEs have predominated: dabbing,
cartridge vaporizers (CVs), and top-loading vaporizers (TLVs). Dabbing
involves flash vaporizing a small amount of CE, a dab, on a hot surface,
a nail, which is connected to a pipe or water pipe, an oil rig or
rig.19 A user quickly and immediately inhales
aerosol generated when the dab is placed onto the nail, which may
require up to an entire vital capacity for complete capture.11 BHO, distillate, and SFE are amenable to dabbing,
though BHO is most common.11,20 CVs are small electronic
cigarette-like devices that use battery-powered resistive heating
to aerosolize CEs. A button-activated battery powers an atomizer located
in a cartridge preloaded with CE to generate aerosol a user inhales
through a mouthpiece; reliance on wicking necessitates extracts containing
neutral THC with added terpenes to decrease viscosity.21 TLVs also use a battery to power a resistively
heated coil but differ in that users manually place the CE directly
onto exposed heating coils in the atomizer ad libitum.22 Any extract may be used in TLV.22 Both TLV and CV are colloquially referred to as vape pens,
and no surveys to date distinguish between the two, categorizing them
together as cannabis e-cigarettes or cannabis electronic vapor products
(CEVPs). In all these CE consumption methods, carrier liquids such
as glycerol, propylene glycol, and medium-chain triglycerides are
not typically included as they are considered to be undesirable.23

Vaporizing (or vaping) cannabis by any
method has gained popularity
among recreational and medical users, particularly young adults and
teens,24 as a less detectable method of
using marijuana compared to smoking that is also perceived to be healthier.25−27 Vaporizers for cannabis inflorescences28,29 have existed long before popularization of CEs,30 and terminology used to refer to these (e.g., vaporizers
and vapes) has been applied for TLV and CV, which has led to some
confusion in the literature. Several studies have investigated prevalence
of CEVPs specifically, though many others exist for inflorescence
vaporizers. The 2016 National Youth Tobacco Survey31 reported that nearly 1 in 11 respondents reported lifetime
use of a CEVP, and other state-level surveys report 3.4% usage among
middle-schoolers,32 5.4–11.4% for
high-schoolers,32,33 and 10.7% for college students.34 Sparse data exists on prevalence of dabbing,
though it appears to be common among regular cannabis users. Twenty
percent of daily/nearly daily cannabis users in the Washington state
reported dabbing in the past week,35 and
36.5% of respondents from a Reddit survey of a similar cohort endorsed
regular use of dabbing as well.36 An internet survey of Twitter posts
found that dabbing-related posts are more prevalent in states with
medical marijuana laws,37 suggesting that
dabbing may grow in popularity as legalization of cannabis expands
access to alternative cannabis products.

The thermal behavior
of cannabinoids has been studied in the context
of the conversion of CBD to THC or other potentially psychoactive
compounds in smoked marijuana, smoked tobacco with CBD,38−41 and pyrolysis of CBD alone.42,43 While searching for
potentially psychoactive CBD pyrolysis products, many olivetol derivatives
with intact pentyl chains (Figure 2, compds 1–5)44,45 and other
products were found to stem from rearrangement of CBD’s terpene
moiety (Figure 2, compds
6 and 7),46 indicating that this may be
particularly labile. Exhaustive in its efforts to identify potential
pharmacologically active products, work at the University of Utrecht
did not prioritize identifying volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
Harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs) of cannabis smoke
have been previously studied,47,48 but no information
is available concerning pyrolysis or oxidation products of cannabinoids
relevant to dabbing or vaping conditions. Moreover, it is not clear
if the HPHCs arise from the cannabinoids, terpenes, or any other plant
constituents. A recent study described BHO diluted in glycerol and
propylene glycol added to a CV-type device, which does not embody
the manner in which cannabis concentrates are vaporized.49 Evidence-based data is needed to better understand
toxicology and routes of administration of these emerging products.
We currently do not know, for instance, the aerosol doses of cannabinoids,
terpenes, and potentially toxic degradation products being delivered
to vulnerable cohorts such as teens and pre-teens or to medical marijuana
patients with compromised immune systems.

Figure 2 Cannabidiol degradation
products.

Quantitative risk assessment (QRA)
is an analytically driven risk
calculation that pools biological and chemical data to approximate
the probability of the incidence of a defined outcome or symptom upon
exposure to a given HPHC. QRA has been previously performed for tobacco
products,50,52 for example, for comparison of “reduced
exposure” cigarettes to regular cigarettes.51 Cancer risk may be approximated using the excess lifetime
cancer risk (ELCR) and noncancer risks using the hazard index (HI).
ELCR, the incremental probability of contracting cancer upon specified
conditions of exposure to a carcinogen,52 is derived from the inhalation unit risk (IUR), an estimate of the
increased risk (i.e., above baseline) of developing cancer due to
exposure to a 1 μg/m3 concentration of a given chemical.53 The reference exposure level (REL) is an estimate
of an air concentration that is not likely to create an appreciable
risk in humans after continuous inhalation and is calculated in reference
to a given symptom that occurs after chronic exposure.53 Both the IUR and REL may have uncertainties
spanning an order of magnitude. A given exposure concentration divided
by the REL yields a hazard quotient (HQ) wherein HQ > 1 indicates
that the threshold of toxic effects on the target system is surpassed.
ELCR and HQ values for individual chemicals are summed to yield total
ELCR (ELCRT) and HI, respectively, which may be used to
guide policy decisions regarding environmental cleanup projects and
consumer products.52

Previously,
our lab had investigated thermal degradation products
of terpenes that are present in CEs when exposed to dabbing conditions.19 We hypothesize that cannabinoids will generate
similar degradation products given their terpene backbone. Given the
restricted availability of marijuana derivatives for research, it
was possible only to synthetically recreate the CE product distillate
by mixing analytical-grade THC with a terpene aromatherapy mix of
cannabis cultivar Fire OG in a ratio of 9:1 THC:terpenes. Herein,
we report an investigation of the chemical makeup of aerosol gas phases
(GPs) obtained by dabbing pure THC and this synthetic distillate (SND)
in addition to vaping SND in a CV device at three power levels commonly
used. Adsorption/thermal desorption gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (ATD-GCMS) is used to quantify target VOC analytes, and
other aerosol GP components are estimated using a nontarget analysis
approach. Identified components provide mechanistic insight into the
thermal degradation of cannabinoids. Quantitative risk assessment
(QRA) calculations are applied to estimate cancer and noncancer risks
from dabbing and CV usage, and the results of which are compared to
risks from smoking cannabis using quantitated cannabis smoke components
from the literature.55−58 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the safety
of CEVP and dabbing has been studied, and the first time quantitative
risk assessment has been used to evaluate the safety of cannabis smoking.

Results
GP aerosol components generated from dabbing THC and SND were quantified
using internal standard (IS)-normalized multipoint calibration of
methacrolein, benzene, xylenes, toluene, styrene, and ethylbenzene
in duplicate samples, and response factors (RFs) calculated from ISs
were used to estimate levels of these components seen from vaping
SND in a CV at three voltages (Table 1). Isoprene levels were estimated using internal standard-calculated
response factors (IS-RFs) in all cases. A large diversity of other
hydrocarbon (HC) components with a majority of alkenes was observed
in all GCMS chromatograms acquired, though the spread differed between
SND dabbing (Table S1) and THC dabbing
samples (Table S2). Levels of the major-occurring
VOCs, identified by comparison of mass spectra against those in the
National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) mass spectrometry
database (match qualities of >70%), were estimated by a previously
published nontarget analysis method (see Methods
and Materials),58,59 and the results of which are
displayed in Tables S1 and S2. GP components
from dabs of 11 ± 2.5 mg of either THC or SND were measured and
scaled up to 40 mg (reported average dab60), assuming equivalent sidestream losses of the GP components across
different dab sizes. For CV vaping, GP components are presented from
single-puff measurements using standard puff topography for e-cigarettes.
Many oxygenated compounds identified in the THC dabbing chromatograms
(2,5-dimethylfuran, 2,3-dimethylacrolein, etc.) were not identifiable
in SND dabbing and CV vaping chromatograms. Analysis of selected ion
chromatograms of ions relevant to these oxygenated products in SND
samples indicates the presence of these THC-specific degradation products,
though they were not quantifiable by nontarget analysis due to overlap
from vastly more abundant alkenic terpene degradation products. Sample
chromatograms from dabbing THC and SND are presented in the Supporting
Information (Figures S1 and S2). A sample
chromatogram of CV vaping was not displayed given its similarity to
that of SND dabbing.

To
make the comparison between the risks associated with CV vaping,
dabbing, and smoking, the level of chronic consumption of each was
matched so each would deliver an equivalent daily dose of THC. This
was necessary given the lack of information about specific consumption
habits for CV vaping and dabbing but is justified based on literature
precedence. Van Dam et al.61 reported a
significant decrease in daily grams of cannabis consumed in users
that switched from smoking to vaporizing flower cannabis, which has
a THC delivery efficiency higher than that of smoking,62 suggesting that users adjust the quantity consumed
to obtain the same THC delivery based on personal preference. Analogous
to the pack-year for cigarette smoking, the joint-year has been used
as a measure of cannabis consumption widely used in epidemiological
studies of cannabis use63−65 and is defined as smoking 1 joint/day
over the course of a year. The joint-year was chosen as the reference
point to which approximate THC deliveries for dabbing and CV vaping
would be matched by the consumption rate (CR; see Methods and Materials). Assuming a THC content of 17.1%66 in cannabis and a THC transfer efficiency of
43%62,67 during smoking, a standard 0.75 g joint68,69 would yield 55 mg of THC, two 40 mg dabs would yield 55 mg of THC
assuming a THC content of 90% and a transfer efficiency of 76%,70 and 20 puffs from a vape pen (at 4.8 V) would
yield 54 mg of THC assuming an 85% yield on 4 mg puffs of cannabis
distillate containing 90% THC (m/m).

Discussion
The
identification of several carbonyls, aromatics, and isoprene
was in line with a previous report from our lab.19 Given that all the terpenes tested in Meehan-Atrash et
al.19 resulted in a comparable array of
volatile products, it was hypothesized that isoprene is an intermediate
in the degradation of these compounds. Cannabinoids such as THC contain
a terpene backbone, and it is not surprising that similar volatile
products are generated from dabbing THC, SND, and terpenes alone.19 A diversity of degradation mechanisms may occur
upon thermal treatment of THC, but the significant levels of isoprene
seen when dabbing THC alone indicate that the isoprene formed undergoes
oxidation to release methacrolein and methyl vinyl ketone, a mechanism
for which has been described in the context of atmospheric oxidation.71,72 Isoprene has been previously described as a neutral product formed
during fragmentation of THC in electron impact mass spectrometry.73−75 The nearly fivefold increase in isoprene released from THC amended
with ∼10% terpenes compared to THC alone (Table 1) suggests that terpenes release
isoprene more readily than THC. Indeed, all identified VOCs form in
higher amounts per milligram of product consumed when dabbing SND
than from THC alone. Other minor components in CEs (hydrocarbons,
fatty acids, flavonoids, phenols, etc.15) may add to or alter GP degradants of other extract formulations.

The work presented herein represents a preliminary investigation
into the GP aerosol components a cannabis consumer may be exposed
to when vaping distillate in a CV or via dabbing. Several identified
components are International Agency for Research on Cancer-classified
carcinogens, and exposure to these may place a burden on the health
of people that use dabbing or vaping to consume cannabis. In an attempt
to interpret results in the most relevant way possible to health professionals
and consumers alike, components for which toxicological metrics had
been previously calculated were applied to a QRA calculation. Despite
the rise in alternative cannabis administration methods, cannabis
smoking remains to be the more prevalent mode of cannabis consumption
to date,30,76,77 warranting
a systematic comparison between methods of inhalation. Previously
quantified components of cannabis smoke were aggregated from the literature54−57 and correspondingly applied to the same QRA analysis in a first
attempt to compare the relative safety of smoking cannabis to two
existing methods of vaporizing distillate.

Results indicate
that vaping or dabbing distillates has lower HI
and ELCR than those of cannabis smoking by several orders of magnitude
(Table 2). These findings
are not definitive and must be interpreted with caution as they are
only a first step toward determining the overall safety of these cannabis
inhalation methods. Only GP components were measured in this work
and were applied to QRA calculations, which may underestimate risks
due to exclusion of potentially toxic particulate phase components.
Previous literature indicates that aldehydes/small organics contribute
the largest percentage of the total cancer risk among constituents
of cigarette smoke,50 which appears to
hold true for cannabis smoke as well (Table S4). Furthermore, HI and ELCR are only measures of chronic effects
and do not indicate relative safety in the context of acute effects,
particularly in light of the recent rash of vaping related illnesses,
the cause of which has not been fully identified.

Though widely
used by regulatory bodies to make evidence-based
decisions on environmental risks to human health, quantitative risk
assessment has several unavoidable sources of uncertainty, which is
currently magnified due to the lack of standardization in the study
of cannabis consumption as compared to tobacco. Machine smoking attempts
to imitate realistic use but is only an approximation.52 In this study, a puff profile set by the Cooperation
Center for Scientific Research Relative to Tobacco (CORESTA) for e-cigarettes
was chosen given the functional similarity of these devices to e-cigarettes;
however, puffing topography for CEVPs has not been studied, which
represents another source of systematic error of unknown magnitude
in the work herein. When calculating ELCR and HI, it is assumed that
100% of each component is absorbed and that the total risk is the
sum of the risk from each individual component, which may over- or
underestimate the total risk. For cigarette smoking, it has been noted
that ELCR values underestimate risks when these are compared to epidemiological
data.50 However, the cancer risk for cannabis
smoking calculated herein, which is comparable to that calculated
for cigarette smoking,50 is in stark contrast
to the negligible association between cannabis smoking and cancer.78

In regard to noncancer effects, the major
contributor to the elevated
HI for cannabis smoking, acrolein, could potentially be responsible
for the association between cannabis smoking and respiratory symptoms.79,80 Given the uncertainty associated with QRA, dabbing HI may exceed
unity under altered conditions such as increased nail temperature,
which has been shown to linearly increase degradant formation,19 or increased terpene content. Ninety-one percent
of the HI from dabbing stems from methacrolein; the REL of which stems
from chronic respiratory tract effects (Table S3) and has been specifically implicated as the cause of lung
injury due to dabbing BHO in a medical case report.81 The elevated levels of conjugated dienes (Table S1 and S2) warrant mention as these have been implicated
as prohaptens.82 The complete absence of
detectable acrolein in dabbing and vaping GP warrants mention as it
may imply that this cannabis smoke component stems from plant components
other than cannabinoids and terpenes.

Despite the reduction
in the toxicant yield for CE vaporizers compared
to smoking and the corresponding low HI and ELCR values, the elevated
concentration of THC in the total particulate matter (TPM) may have
untold physicochemical83 and pharmacological
effects84 on the respiratory system. For
example, cannabis smoke with ∼1% THC content was shown to compromise
the surface properties of a lung surfactant replacement product83 due to intercalation of the hydrophobic THC
molecule. The effect of higher concentrations of THC and high-molecular
weight terpenes in the aerosol particulate phase and any partitioning85 of GP dienes and other VOCs into the lung surfactant
layer warrants further investigation.

Conclusions
ATD-GCMS
identified and quantified gaseous degradants using calibrated
standards for target analytes, and a nontarget analysis approach was
used for other components identified in the chromatograms. Given the
similarity of compounds identified in these experiments to those found
when dabbing terpenes alone,19 GP degradants
seen when dabbing THC alone were also assessed. The similarity in
degradation products seen, particularly the elevated levels of isoprene
seen across the board, suggests an analogous degradation mechanism
for cannabinoids and terpenes. Higher levels of terpenes appear to
promote increased production of VOCs.

Toxicants measured were
applied to a QRA calculation to estimate
cancer and noncancer risks for dabbing and vaping with a CV. In order
to compare these results with cannabis smoking, cannabis smoke component
levels were taken from the literature and applied to a QRA calculation.
This represents the first time any degradation products have been
identified from vaporizing CE components and is a first step toward
understanding the degradation mechanism of THC via this route of administration.
Additionally, the work herein is the first application of QRA to cannabis
smoking to the best of our knowledge.

The development of novel
cannabis inhalation products has outpaced
both basic and applied biomedical research. This has hindered the
ability of regulatory agencies from properly informing the public
about the safety of these products and their routes of administration.
Future work in our labs will focus on identifying other volatile organics
that have not yet been detected in the GP, such as formaldehyde and
carbon monoxide, and components of the particulate phase that are
potentially toxicologically relevant. Further work must assess the
biological impact these aerosols have on the respiratory system.

Methods
and Materials
Materials
Analytical-grade THC was
obtained from Cayman
Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). A terpene aromatherapy mix recreating the
scent of cannabis cultivar Fire OG was obtained from Blue River (Oakland,
CA) and is referred to hereafter as simply “terpenes.”
To make SND, terpenes were introduced into THC at ∼10%. Verispec
200 ppm Aromatic Hydrocarbons Mixture 16 Components in Methanol EPA
503.1 was obtained from Ricca Chemical Company (Arlington, TX). An
isoprene SPEXOrganics Certified Reference Material analytical standard
(1000 μg/mL) was obtained from SPEX CertiPrep (Metuchen, NJ).

Sample Collection for Dabbing
An air flow was generated
with a Welch 8907 rotary-vane vacuum pump (Mt. Prospect, IL), regulated
with a Cole-Parmer PTFE multiturn needle valve (Vernon Hills, IL),
and measured with an Aalborg GFM17 mass flow meter (Orangeburg, NY).
A flow rate of 400–450 mL/min was chosen to minimize breakthrough
of volatile components from the adsorption/thermal desorption (ATD)
cartridge while maximizing vapor collection from the e-nail. The ATD
cartridge was situated between two Pyrex T-Bore, three-way, glass
key stopcocks (Corning, NY). Vapor was generated on a Jibtronix Corp.
Errlectric Concentration Station (Gurnee, IL) e-nail heated to ∼370
°C. The temperature used was chosen based on realistic use and
was assessed thermographically using a FLIR System T450sc (Wilsonville,
OR) as in Meehan-Atrash et al.19 A by-pass
line circumventing the ATD cartridge facilitated sample collection
by maintaining a constant backpressure between experiments. All connections
were made using 3/8 in. outer diameter ACF0017-F Tygon S3 E-3603 (Saint-Gobain,
Malvern, PA). All experiments were performed by collecting GPs generated
from a single dab of 11 ± 2.5 mg of either THC or SND. Figure 3 (top) depicts the
experimental setup used for collection of the aerosol GP generated
from dabbing.

Sample Collection for CV
Vaping
A CH Technologies cigarette
smoking machine (CSM, Westwood, NJ) ran a puff program modified from
CORESTA with 55 mL puff volume over a 3 s puff duration with an additional
1 s after the conclusion of each puff to clear the lines of aerosol
(vaporizer button was only depressed during the 3 s puffs). Aerosol
was generated using a CCell TH2 oil cartridge (Sneaky Pete vaporizers)
loaded with SND and connected to an Innokin iTaste VV V3.0 variable
voltage battery. The atomizer was rated at 1.4–1.5 Ω
according to the digital display provided by the battery. All connections
were made using 3/8 in. outer diameter ACF0017-F Tygon S3 E-3603.
Vaping experiments were conducted using single puffs at three voltages
chosen based on realistic use: 3.2, 4.0, and 4.8 V, which consumed
1–4 mg of SND per puff. Figure 3 (bottom) depicts the experimental setup used for collection
of the aerosol GP generated from vaping.

Adsorption/Thermal Desorption
Gas Chromatography–Mass
Spectrometry
GP samples were collected through a 47 mm Cambridge
filter pad (CFP, GE Healthcare) onto an ATD cartridge, which contains
100 mg of 35/60 mesh Tenax TA and 200 mg of 60/80 mesh Carbograph
1 TD (Camsco Inc., Houston, TX). ATD sample cartridges were thermally
desorbed with a TurboMatrix 650 ATD unit (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA).
Twenty nanograms of fluorobenzene, 18.6 ng of toluene-d8, 21.7 ng of 4-bromofluorobenzene, and 20.3 ng of 1,2-dichlorobenzene-d4 were added automatically to all cartridges
as ISs prior to desorption. The ATD unit thermally desorbed the ATD
cartridges for 10 min at 285 °C with a He desorption flow of
40 mL/min, a split flow of 10 mL/min, and the desorption stream was
trapped at −10 °C on an intermediate “Tenax trap.”
Thermal desorption of this intermediate trap occurred at 295 °C
and 35 psi constant pressure of He on a split flow of 12 mL/min for
4 min. Through a 1 m long and 0.25 mm i.d. deactivated fused silica
transfer line (235 °C), the unsplit portion of the stream was
passed on to a 60 m length, 0.25 mm i.d., and 1.4 μm film thickness
Agilent (Santa Clara, CA) DB-VRX capillary GC column mounted in an
Agilent 7890A GC. The GC was interfaced to an Agilent 5975C MS in
impact ionization at 70 eV in the positive ion mode. GC oven temperature
was held at 45 °C for 10 min, programming to 190 °C at 12
°C/min, held at 190 °C for 2 min, then programming to 240
°C at 6 °C/min, held at 240 °C for 5 min, and then
programmed down to 210 °C at 10 °C/min. The MS scan range
was 34 to 400 amu, and the electron multiplier voltage was 1725 V.

Quantification of Components from CV Vaping and Dabbing
An ATD-GCMS IS-normalized multipoint calibration was generated for
quantifying select analytes for dabbing experiments. A standardized
solution of methacrolein and the components in the Verispec 200 ppm
aromatic hydrocarbons mixture were made at concentrations of 6.25–200
ng/μL in serial dilution. An additional solution of 250 ng/μL
isoprene was made using the SPEXOrganics Certified Reference Material.
Two microliters of each chosen standard solution was spiked through
a 0.25” Swagelok tee onto the inlet end of each ATD cartridge
with a flow of 50 mL/min of N2 gas. After spiking, the
N2 flow was left on for ∼7 min to purge the methanol
solvent. Six ATD cartridges were amended with 0, 3.125, 12.5, 25,
50, and 100 ng of each component from standard solutions containing
methacrolein and the Verispec 200 ppm aromatic hydrocarbons mixture
components. An additional cartridge was amended with 500 ng of isoprene
only.

IS-RF factors for the 17 analytes used in the multipoint
calibration and isoprene were calculated and used to estimate the
concentration of these in the ATD-GCMS samples from three cannabis
vaping experiments. Analytes in addition to those used in the multipoint
calibration were tentatively identified by comparison of their mass
spectra against those in the NIST mass spectrometry database. Quantification
of some major-occurring alkenes, carbonyls, and aromatics was performed
using a nontarget analysis approach based on one described in Fitch
et al.58 and Allgood et al.59 Nontarget analytes were chosen based on abundance,
integrated in the total ion chromatogram (TIC), and their molecular
formula from the tentative match (all match qualities of >70%)
was
used to calculate their total ionization cross section (Q) using the regression equation from Fitch et al.58 The Q of an IS was used to determine the
levels of the nontarget analyte using eq 1 from Allgood et al.:59 1  where A is
the integrated TIC area and N is the number of moles
of the analyte (a) and IS.

Cannabis Smoke Component Literature Review
Literature
reports containing pertinent data were searched in multiple scientific
databases including but not limited to SciFinder and Web of Science.
Values for cannabis smoke HPHCs from all reports containing quantitative
data were used. Smoke component identities and their measured values
were pulled from the four references deemed suitable for this analysis.54−57 Other relevant information such as puff topography, cannabis consumed
per experiment, and joint sizes were also noted. HPHC levels were
presented as mass HPHC per joint,56 parts
per million concentrations,54 mass HPHC
per gram cannabis consumed,55 and mass
HPHC per milligram TPM collected.57 All
component levels identified were converted to microgram HPHC per gram
of cannabis using the reported joint size. This was subsequently converted
to microgram HPHC per 0.75 g joint, which was chosen as the standard
joint mass. HPHCs were assigned CAS numbers, and levels of identical
HPHCs were binned and averaged together.

Quantitative Risk Assessment
Toxicological metrics
for cancer and chronic noncancer effects for HPCs identified in the
GP of the aerosol from vaping, dabbing, and smoking were searched
in relevant databases. The IUR was used for cancer risk assessment,
and RELs were used for noncancer effects. IUR values were accessed
from the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) online database
provided by the United State Environmental Protection Agency86 and supplemented with values from the California
Office of Environmental Health and Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) online
chemical database.87 REL values were taken
as an inhalation reference concentration (RfC) from IRIS86 or as a reference value (ReV) from the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ).88 Given the high levels of isoprene observed from vaping and dabbing,
the IUR value for isoprene was found in the literature89 given its absence in IRIS, OEHHA, and TCEQ databases.

Quantitative
Risk Assessment for Cancer Effects
ELCR
as defined in Marano et al.52 for each
HPHC i for which an IUR value exists was calculated
using eq 2, adapted from
Marano et al.:52 2  where CYi is the yield for a given gaseous
HPHC, CU is the consumption
unit, CR is the consumption rate, ED is the exposure duration, EF
is the exposure frequency, IR is the inhalation rate, and ATC is the averaging time for cancer effects. CU is a consumption method-dependent
unit (vaping: CU = puffs, dabbing: CU = dabs, and smoking: CU = joints).
CYi is the experimentally determined yield
of a given HPHC given in micrograms per CU. As per United States Food
and Drug Administration recommendations,52 ED is taken as the difference of the default lifetime expectancy
of 70 years52 and the age of initiation,
which for cannabis consumption is taken as 16 years based on literature
precedence.90−96 EF assumes daily consumption at 365.25 days/year. IR is taken as
the human reference value of 20 m3/day.52 ATC prorates the cumulative intake of the component
over a lifetime of 70 years expressed in days (25567.5 days).52 Taking the assumption of dose additivity, the
ELCRi for each component may be summed
to obtain ELCRT:50−52 3  

Quantitative Risk Assessment for Noncancer Effects
HQ, as
previously defined,52 for a given
component i (HQi) for
which an REL exists was calculated using eq 4, adapted from Marano et al.:52 4  where ATNC is the
averaging time for noncancer effects, which averages component intake
over the ED, for a value of 19723.5 days assuming an ED of 54 years.
HI, as previously defined, is the sum of HQ for all components for
which an REL exists: 5
