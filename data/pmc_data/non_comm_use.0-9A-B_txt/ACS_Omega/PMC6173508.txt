Caloric
restriction (CR) is an intervention that can increase maximal
lifespan in organisms, but its application to humans remains challenging.
A more feasible approach to achieve lifespan extension is to develop
CR mimetics that target biochemical pathways affected by CR. Recent
studies in the engineering and structural characterization of polyketide
synthases (PKSs) have facilitated their use as biocatalysts to produce
novel polyketides. Here, we show that by establishing a combinatorial
biosynthetic route in Escherichia coli and exploring the substrate promiscuity of a mutant PKS from alfalfa,
413 potential anti-ageing polyketides were biosynthesized. In this
approach, novel acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) precursors generated by promiscuous
acid-CoA ligases were utilized by PKS to generate polyketides which
were then fed to Caenorhabditis elegans to study their potential efficacy in lifespan extension. It was
found that CR mimetics like resveratrol can counter the age-associated
decline in mitochondrial function and increase the lifespan of C. elegans. Using the mitochondrial respiration profile
of C. elegans supplemented for 8 days
with 50 μM resveratrol as a blueprint, we can screen our novel
polyketides for potential CR mimetics with improved potency. This
study highlights the utility of synthetic enzymology in the development
of novel anti-ageing therapeutics.

1 Introduction
Caloric
restriction (CR) is defined as a reduction of caloric intake
by 30–40% of ad libitum consumption, without causing malnutrition.1 CR can cause lifespan extension by triggering
a shift from a physiological state of proliferation and growth, to
repair and maintenance. Studies have shown that CR reduces oxidative
damage, retards age-related functional decline such as deteriorations
in DNA repair capacity, and causes a 30% increase in maximal lifespan
of mammals.2−4 Nevertheless, the amount and duration of CR necessary
to extend lifespan is not practical in humans.5 A feasible solution lies in developing a CR mimetic that can directly
target biochemical pathways affected by CR and similarly achieve lifespan
extension.

Natural products represent a good starting point
for drug discovery,
and there is great interest in synthesizing analogs of these compounds
in order to explore the mechanism of action, and enhance bioactivity
and bioavailability. Polyketides are functionally and structurally
diverse secondary metabolites produced in bacteria, fungi, and plants.
Many of these bioactive natural products have significant medical
applications,6 including their use as immunosuppressants,7 antibiotics,8 and
potential anti-ageing therapeutics.9 Resveratrol
is hypothesized to be a CR mimetic10,11 as it increases
mitochondrial resistance to oxidative stress and extends the lifespan
of Caenorhabditis elegans.12 Although resveratrol confers some anti-ageing
benefits, its application in humans is fraught with challenges. One
problem of administering resveratrol in humans is its low solubility
and high metabolism, resulting in low bioavailability.13 Moreover, some research has suggested that resveratrol
may have potential adverse effects like nephrotoxicity.14,15 The corollary to these challenges requires a need to discover new
CR mimetics that are more potent (increased bioavailability and efficacy)
in bringing about lifespan extension in humans.

Polyketides
are typically biosynthesized through successive decarboxylative
condensations of coenzyme A (CoA)-derived precursors, into a complex
polycyclic multi-carbon compound containing keto or hydroxyl groups.16 Because of the chemical and structural complexity
of polyketides and their derivatives, chemical synthesis is difficult.
Current research in the engineering and structural characterization
of polyketide synthases (PKSs) has facilitated their use as biocatalysts
to generate novel polyketides, which can serve as potential drug leads.17

Type III PKSs are homodimeric and acyl-carrier
protein-independent
enzymes which can accomplish a series of decarboxylative condensations
and cyclization reactions within a single active site. The relative
simplicity, flexibility, and unusually broad substrate specificity
of type III PKSs make them ideal candidates for engineering, facilitating
the accessibility of bioactive polyketide libraries which are otherwise
not easily available.18,19 One of the most well-understood
type III PKS is chalcone synthase (CHS), which is ubiquitous in higher
plants and crucial for plant metabolism and defense.18,20 Chalcone synthesis by CHS is initiated by the loading of p-coumaroyl-CoA onto the active site cysteine residue; CHS
then catalyzes three iterative decarboxylative condensations of the
extender substrate, malonyl-CoA, with the cysteine-bound starter substrate,
to form a linear tetraketide intermediate. Subsequently, the intermediate
undergoes an intramolecular C6 to C1 Claisen condensation and cyclizes
into chalcone, which undergoes a further Michael-type ring closure
to form naringenin.20

Unlike CHSs
which are ubiquitous, stilbene synthases (STSs) are
found in only a small subset of unrelated plants. Structure-based
mutagenic transformation of alfalfa CHS into STS established that
modulations in active-site residues enabled STSs to catalyze an intramolecular
C2 to C7 aldol condensation, followed by decarboxylation and dehydration
to produce a stilbene scaffold.21 Eighteen
distal amino acid residues in alfalfa CHS spanning from residue 98
to 268 were mutated, resulting in a mutant CHS with STS activity (18xCHS).
The 18xCHS was able to produce resveratrol as the major product, instead
of naringenin, when incubated with p-coumaroyl-CoA
and malonyl-CoA.

An exploration of substrate and product profiles
of 18xCHS across
various acyl-CoA classes has not been systematically reported. Previous
substrate specificity studies have demonstrated the production of
unnatural polyketides by the promiscuous alfalfa CHS.22 However, because of a lack of means to deliver novel acyl-CoA
precursors, these studies were limited to structural derivatives of
cognate substrates from the cinnamyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA families.
Originating from the promiscuous alfalfa CHS scaffold and with the
ability to produce the CR mimetic resveratrol, 18xCHS provided an
excellent platform for the engineered biosynthesis of novel stilbenes
and other polyketides with potential anti-ageing activities. Using
precursor-directed combinatorial biosynthesis, unnatural acyl-CoA
production by promiscuous CoA-ligases was coupled to polyketide biosynthesis
by 18xCHS. By establishing the substrate specificities of 18xCHS,
polyketide libraries can be synthesized and screened for anti-ageing
properties.

The conventional way of anti-ageing drug screening
is via lifespan
assays. However, lifespan assays are time-consuming and impractical
for screening a large library of bioactive compounds. This study aims
to develop a medium throughput screening methodology by conducting
mitochondrial function assays on C. elegans exposed to various compounds using an Extracellular Flux Analyzer.
By periodically introducing pharmacological agents such as electron
transport chain inhibitors to manipulate mitochondrial activity and
respiratory function, the mitochondrial biology of C. elegans can be examined to establish a correlation
between oxygen consumption rates (OCRs), CR mimetics, and lifespan
extension.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Establishing
a Combinatorial Biosynthetic
Route in Escherichia coli
Precursor-directed combinatorial biosynthesis is a useful means to
generate polyketide analogs. As starter and extender CoA thioesters
were either commercially unavailable or cost prohibitive, and the
biosynthesis of CoA thioesters had to be coupled to PKS, 18xCHS, in
order to generate polyketides (Figure 1). By supplying p-coumaric acid and
malonic acid to the E. coli constructs, p-coumaroyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA were synthesized by 4-coumarate-CoA
ligase (4CL) and malonyl-CoA synthetase (MCS), respectively. 18xCHS
was validated to have resveratrol synthase activity when incubated
with the biosynthesized p-coumaroyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA
(Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). The resveratrol generated by 18xCHS was verified to have an experimental
mass of 227.0712 in the negative MS mode (theoretical mass of 227.0714)
(Figure S2 in the Supporting Information), and NMR analysis further established the identity of the compound
(Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). Several minor peaks were also observed at retention times of 24.4,
35.0, and 40.4 min, indicating the potential biosynthesis of bisnoryangonin, p-coumaroyl triacetic acid lactone, naringenin, as well
as other polyketides resulting from a different number of extension
step or minor products derived from alternate intramolecular cyclization.
This allowed us to set up the platform for precursor-directed combinatorial
biosynthesis, which requires the utilization of different combinations
of acyl-CoA derivatives for the generation of novel polyketides.

Figure 1 E. coli constructs generated for
in vivo precursor-directed combinatorial biosynthesis of polyketides.
Constructs containing the CoA ligases with an empty Tom-15b vector
served as controls during the subsequent high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) analyses. When a starter acid such as p-coumaric
acid and an extender acid such as malonic acid are introduced to the E. coli constructs, the respective CoA thioesters
are formed, which are utilized by 18xCHS to form polyketides like
resveratrol.

Through precursor-directed
biosynthesis using different combinations
of 69 starter CoA thioesters and 12 extender malonyl-CoA derivatives
(Table S1 in the Supporting Information), the substrate profile of 18xCHS was established (Figure 2), and a catalog of polyketides
was obtained based on HPLC analyses. 18xCHS was found to be promiscuous
in substrate utilization, consistent with previously characterized
alfalfa CHS.22 18xCHS was able to utilize
unnatural starter and extender CoA thioesters as substrates for polyketide
synthesis (Figure 3), thus highlighting the feasibility of precursor-directed combinatorial
biosynthesis of polyketides. From the matrix of substrates used, at
least 413 novel polyketides were generated.

Figure 2 Substrate profile of
18xCHS using 69 starter CoA thioesters and
12 extender CoA thioesters; 413 out of 828 possible combinations (49.9%)
gave rise to new polyketides. Extender acyl-CoAs are abbreviated as
follows: malonyl-CoA (Mal), methylmalonyl-CoA (MeMal), ethylmalonyl-CoA
(EtMal), isopropylmalonyl-CoA (IsoMal), butylmalonyl-CoA (ButMal),
allylmalonyl-CoA (AlMal), hydroxymalonyl-CoA (OHMal), fluoromalonyl-CoA
(FMal), chloromalonyl-CoA (ClMal) and bromomalonyl-CoA (BrMal), phenylmalonyl-CoA
(PhMal), and 3-thiophenemalonyl-CoA (3ThMal).

Figure 3 HPLC profile of organic extracts from E. coli constructs grown in M9 supplemented with 2-flurocinnamate and butylmalonate.
Biosynthesized products in spent minimal medium containing either E. coli with CoA ligases + 18xCHS or E. coli with CoA ligases only (control construct)
were extracted and subjected to HPLC analysis. An additional peak
at retention time 38.7 min was observed in the extract containing
the 18xCHS construct, but was not present in the extract containing
the control construct, indicating that a new polyketide was biosynthesized
when 2-fluorocinnamyl-CoA and butylmalonyl-CoA were supplemented to
18xCHS.

2.2 Starter
Acyl-CoA Substrate Preference
18xCHS was able to use cinnamyl-CoA
(Table S2 in the Supporting Information), phenylpropanoyl-CoA
(Table S2 in the Supporting Information), benzoyl-CoA (Table S3 in the Supporting Information), phenylacetyl-CoA (Table S4 in the Supporting Information), bicyclic aromatic CoA (Table S4 in the Supporting Information), and saturated and unsaturated
aliphatic CoA thioester derivatives (Table S5 in the Supporting Information) as starter substrates, in combination
with various malonyl-CoA derivatives as the extender substrate (Figure 4). Interestingly,
benzoyl-CoA derivatives were the most preferred starters (65.8% of
the combinations led to new products formed), followed by unsaturated
aliphatic CoA derivatives (61.7% of the combinations), phenylacetyl-CoA
derivatives (51.4% of the combinations), cinnamyl-CoA derivatives
(50% of the combinations), saturated aliphatic CoA derivatives (36.5%
of the combinations), phenylpropanoyl-CoA derivatives (22.6% of the
combinations), and bicyclic aromatic CoA derivatives (12.5% of the
combinations).

Figure 4 Substrate profile of 18xCHS based on the seven starter
substrate
families. Benzoyl-CoA derivatives were the most preferred starters
while bicyclic aromatic CoA derivatives were least preferred by 18xCHS.
A total of at least 413 novel polyketides were biosynthesized.

Among the cinnamyl-CoA derivatives,
meta-substituted and para-substituted
derivatives were most preferred (62.5 and 60.7% of the combinations,
respectively, led to new products formed), compared to ortho-substituted
(25% of the combinations) and aliphatic chain-substituted (45.8% of
the combinations) derivatives. This suggests that the presence of
substituents at the ortho position may affect the interaction of the
starter unit with the active-site residues of 18xCHS, causing ortho-substituted
cinnamyl-CoA derivatives to be utilized less efficiently. This is
consistent with previous work on alfalfa CHS by Jez and co-workers,
which reported that the catalytic efficiency of alfalfa CHS is lower
when 2-hydroxycinnamyl-CoA is used, compared to 3-hydroxycinnamyl-CoA
and 4-hydroxycinnamyl-CoA.22 Interestingly,
2-hydroxyphenylacetyl-CoA (reacted with 4 out of 12 extenders) was
also less readily utilized by 18xCHS compared to 4-hydroxyphenylacetyl-CoA
(reacted with 8 out of 12 extenders), which is structurally similar
to, but shorter than p-coumaroyl-CoA by a carbon
unit.

When substituent groups are present on the extender acyl-CoA
substrate,
cinnamyl-CoA derivatives are no longer strongly preferred. Instead,
smaller and more flexible starters like benzoyl-CoA derivatives and
unsaturated aliphatic CoA derivatives are more easily accepted by
18xCHS, together with unnatural malonyl-CoA derivatives to form unique
polyketides. Most benzoyl-CoA derivatives were utilized as starters,
regardless of the position of the substituent groups (ortho position:
63.9% of the combinations led to new products formed, meta position:
62.5% of the combinations, para position: 58.3% of the combinations),
suggesting that the benzoyl-CoA backbone is small enough to participate
in reactions with bulky extenders. For unsaturated aliphatic CoA derivatives,
smaller starters with a butenoyl-CoA backbone were most preferred
(70.8% of the combinations led to new products formed), followed by
those with a pentenoyl-CoA backbone (62.5% of the combinations), and
those with a hexenoyl-CoA backbone (41.7% of the combinations). This
is consistent with previous studies on Scutellaria
baicalensis CHS, which proposed that bulkier starter
substrates contributed to unfavorable steric effects when additional
substituent groups were present in the extender acyl-CoA used.23

Surprisingly, other than derivatives of
the cognate substrates,
18xCHS could also utilize chemically distinct starter acyl-CoAs beyond
its canonical substrate pool. In particular, we have shown for the
first time that 18xCHS could accept bicyclic aromatic CoA thioesters
together with malonyl-CoA derivatives to form novel polyketides (6
out of 48 combinations led to new products formed). This substrate
promiscuity can be attributed to substrate mimicry, illustrating how
slight substrate resemblance to the cognate substrates can play a
role in starter unit recognition in 18xCHS and subsequently, the biosynthesis
of novel polyketides (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Structural mimicry of bicyclic aromatic CoA thioesters. The mimicry
to phenylacetyl-CoA (for 1-naphthalenecarboxyl-CoA) and cinnamyl-CoA
(for 2-naphthalenecarboxyl-CoA and 2-quinolinecarboxyl-CoA) is highlighted
in blue.

2.3 Extender
Acyl-CoA Substrate Preference
The repertoire of novel polyketides
biosynthesized from the 69 ×
12 assays also provided insights into the extender substrate preference
of 18xCHS. By collating the number of starter acyl-CoAs that reacted
with each extender substrate (Figure 2), the order of preference for extender acyl-CoA substrates
for 18xCHS was established: 3-thiophenemalonyl-CoA > phenylmalonyl-CoA
= fluoromalonyl-CoA > chloromalonyl-CoA > ethylmalonyl-CoA >
malonyl-CoA
> methylmalonyl-CoA > hydroxymalonyl-CoA > butylmalonyl-CoA
= bromomalonyl-CoA
> allylmalonyl-CoA > isopropylmalonyl-CoA. It was likely that
the
extender substrate preference of 18xCHS was dependent on the stability
of the carbanion intermediate generated during catalysis.

When
the extender acyl-CoA enters the active site of 18xCHS, it is decarboxylated
to form a carbanion intermediate which can attack the starter unit
or elongate polyketide bound to the catalytic cysteine residue in
the active site. This carbanion intermediate is stabilized by a resonance
effect in all the malonyl-CoA derivatives, aided by the nearby His303
and Asn336 residues (numbering in alfalfa CHS). Certain substituent
groups in the malonyl-CoA derivatives can affect the degree of stabilization
of the carbanion intermediate. For instance, 3-thiophenemalonyl-CoA
and phenylmalonyl-CoA were strongly preferred compared to the other
extenders (Figure 2), perhaps because of the presence of the aromatic ring which can
confer additional stability via resonance effects (Figure 6).

Figure 6 Resonance structures
depicting the stabilization of the carbanion
of 3-thiophenemalonyl-CoA after decarboxylation.

Among the halogen-substituted malonyl-CoA derivatives, the
fluoro-substituted
malonyl-CoA derivative has the greatest inductive effect because of
the high electronegativity of the fluorine atom. Thus, the carbanion
intermediate is greatly stabilized and fluoromalonyl-CoA is the preferred
extender, compared to chloromalonyl-CoA and bromomalonyl-CoA. This
is a finding similar to the extender acyl-CoA substrate preference
of a type III PKS from Oryza sativa, where fluoromalonyl-CoA is one of the most preferred extender compared
to the other 11 that were tested.24

Compared to the aromatic malonyl-CoA derivatives, the aliphatic
derivatives such as malonyl-CoA, methylmalonyl-CoA, ethylmalonyl-CoA,
isopropylmalonyl-CoA, butylmalonyl-CoA, and allylmalonyl-CoA generated
a range of novel polyketides with 21–39 starters out of the
69 starter substrates tested. However, the order of preference was
not manifested as a significant trend. Taken together, by determining
the substrate preference of 18xCHS, a library of novel polyketides
with potential anti-ageing utility can be biosynthesized.

2.4 Mass Spectrometry Profiling of Novel Polyketides
The
substrate profile of 18xCHS was confirmed by determining the
mass of the polyketide products using mass spectrometry (MS). Selected
combinations of starters and extenders were used to generate polyketides,
which were then purified by HPLC and analyzed by MS. Most of the masses
of the selected polyketides identified in this study matched their
corresponding expected masses, and some of the potential chemical
structures of the compounds were proposed (Table S6 in the Supporting Information). The exact identities
of these products, however, require further validation by NMR analyses.
In some instances, cyclization of the polyketide intermediate may
not have occurred and the active-site cysteine-bound intermediate
is hydrolyzed to form the corresponding acid, which may undergo decarboxylation
to form a novel polyketide (Figure 7). In other cases, some of these polyketides could
be truncated side products generated from the 18xCHS reaction, which
include polyketides with fewer polyketide extension steps, or those
that were biosynthesized through a lactonization, aldol or Claisen
condensation of the linear polyketide intermediate (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information).

Figure 7 Potential polyketide
formed from one unit of p-coumaroyl-CoA and butylmalonyl-CoA
without cyclization.

Many of the starter and extender substrates used in this
research
study have not been explored in previous studies, and the product
library biosynthesized is expected to comprise novel polyketides with
chalcone, stilbene, and lactone scaffolds. It has been shown that
MS analysis provides an idea of the identity of the new products from
precursor-directed combinatorial biosynthesis. These polyketides can
then be further characterized by NMR to determine their chemical structure
and properties. By obtaining a profile of novel polyketides, the compound
library can subsequently be applied to drug screening efforts, such
as the development of anti-ageing therapeutics.

2.5 Lifespan Assays Using Resveratrol or Novel
Polyketides
Studies on resveratrol have revealed the compound
to be a potential CR mimetic.10 When 50
μM resveratrol was introduced to C. elegans, a significant lifespan extension was observed when compared to
controls fed with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Figure 8A). C. eleganseat-2 mutants have a pharyngeal pumping defect,
which results in compromised food intake25 and consequently chronic CR. Similar to resveratrol-treated C. elegans, eat-2 mutants have a
longer lifespan compared to their wild-type counterparts (Figure 8B), suggesting an
association between resveratrol and CR. Nevertheless, studies have
shown that resveratrol is rapidly metabolized when ingested, and it
has a broad spectrum of activity in various cellular components.10,15 Hence, issues of bioavailability and adverse effects warrant the
search for other CR mimetics that are more potent than resveratrol.

Figure 8 (A) Survival
plots of C. elegans fed with 50 μM
commercially available resveratrol (green)
or 0.1% DMSO (blue). Worms exposed to 50 μM resveratrol had
a significantly longer mean lifespan (27.4 days) compared to the DMSO
control (17.1 days). (B) Survival plots of wild-type N2 (blue) and eat-2 (green) C. elegans. eat-2 mutants had a significantly longer mean lifespan (17.6
days) compared to the wild-type worms (14.3 days). The p-values were calculated using log rank test, and a p-value ≤ 0.05 is considered to be statistically significant.

Of the 413 novel polyketides,
24 were tested for anti-ageing properties
in a C. elegans lifespan assay (Table
S7 in the Supporting Information). Most
of the tested combinations had no significant effects on the lifespan
of wild-type N2 C. elegans except for
the products derived from 3-chlorocinnamyl-CoA + malonyl-CoA and 3-(3′-chloro-4′-methoxy)phenylpropanoyl-CoA
+ methylmalonyl-CoA which had toxic effects and led to a shorter lifespan
compared to the control (Figure 9). Interestingly, worms treated with 3-(3′-chloro-4′-methoxy)phenylpropanoic
acid, methylmalonic acid, and the control E. coli construct had a mean lifespan of 26.5 days. This suggests that the
acids used or the CoA esters produced could have some effects on the
lifespan of wild-type C. elegans. More
studies are needed to verify the biological effects of these compounds.

Figure 9 Survival
plots of N2 C. elegans fed
with either 18xCHS E. coli strain (green)
or control E. coli strain (blue) supplemented
with 3-chlorocinnamic acid + malonic acid (left) or 3-(3′-chloro-4′-methoxy)phenylpropanoic
acid + methylmalonic acid (right). Worms exposed to the novel polyketides
produced from these two combinations of starter and extender acids
had a significantly shorter mean lifespan compared to the control
which is exposed to the respective carboxylic acids and CoA esters
only.

Although the 18xCHS strain can
produce resveratrol when supplemented
with p-coumaric acid and malonic acid, a significant
lifespan extension effect was not observed. This is due to the low
concentration of resveratrol biosynthesized by the E. coli constructs growing on the nematode growth
media (NGM) agar plates (approximately 1 μM from HPLC analysis).
Even though the concentration of novel polyketides being biosynthesized
is low, we hope to identify anti-ageing compounds that can work well
even at low doses. This may lead to the development of an anti-ageing
drug lead that has minimal adverse effects common with resveratrol
treatment.

2.6 C. elegans Respiration
Assays Using Resveratrol or Novel Polyketides
Despite the
utility of lifespan assays, they are rather time-consuming as the
average lifespan of C. elegans is 3
weeks. Hence, there is a need to develop a higher throughput method
to screen our library of compounds for anti-ageing properties. Since
CR is known to promote longevity by modulating oxidative metabolism,26 it would be logical to look at the mitochondrial
activity of C. elegans when they were
exposed to potential CR mimetics. Mitochondrial function assays were
developed and optimized in order to establish a correlation between
OCRs, mitochondrial activity, and longevity.

It was observed
that C. elegans exposed to 8 days of
50 μM resveratrol have a higher average basal OCR, higher average
maximal OCR, and higher spare respiratory capacity (Figure 10) when compared to their controls.
This suggested that exposure to a potential CR mimetic for at least
8 days can counteract the age-related decline in the mitochondrial
function in C. elegans by increasing
the average basal respiration, average maximal respiration, and spare
respiratory capacity. The increase in spare respiratory capacity was
indicative of improvements in the ability of the mitochondria to cope
with changes in ATP demand.

Figure 10 Wild-type N2 worms exposed to 8 days of 50
μM resveratrol
had a significantly higher basal OCR, maximal OCR, and spare respiratory
capacity compared to N2 worms exposed to 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine
(FUdR) or FUdR + 0.1% DMSO. Consistent with results using the CR mimetic
resveratrol, eat-2 mutants undergo chronic CR and
have a higher basal respiration, maximal respiration, and spare respiratory
capacity compared to wild-type C. elegans. Introducing 50 μM resveratrol to eat-2 mutants
does not improve their mitochondrial function further. FUdR: worms
exposed to FUdR treatment only; DMSO: worms exposed to FUdR + 0.1%
DMSO; Resv: worms exposed to FUdR + 50 μM resveratrol. *p-value ≤ 0.05; **p-value ≤
0.01; ***p-value ≤ 0.001; ****p-value ≤ 0.0001.

Our findings supported a recent study which also observed
an increase
in the C. elegans basal mitochondrial
respiration rate when the worms were exposed to resveratrol.9 A likely hypothesis for this intriguing observation
is that resveratrol can mimic a CR state, which causes metabolism
to shift away from glycolysis toward respiration in order to maintain
body function.27,28 This eventually results in elevated
electron transport, respiration, and ROS production. Low exposure
to a greater oxidative stress triggers a secondary adaptive response
called mitohormesis in the host’s defence system, leading to
better stress resistance and lifespan extension.26,29

In addition, C. eleganseat-2 mutants exhibited a higher basal OCR, maximal OCR,
and spare respiratory capacity compared to wild-type worms (Figure 10). This is consistent
with the effects of the CR mimetic resveratrol on mitochondrial function,
highlighting the potential of mitochondrial function assays in screening
for CR mimetics. Nevertheless, subjecting eat-2 mutants
to resveratrol treatment did not result in further increases in basal
OCR, maximal OCR, and spare respiratory capacity. This suggested a
strain on the mitochondrial function of the eat-2 mutants which were already experiencing chronic CR; subjecting the
mutants to further CR mimetic exposures could have detrimental effects
on mitochondrial function. Indeed, eat-2 mutants
exposed to 50 μM resveratrol treatment exhibited a shorter mean
lifespan (15.9 days) as compared to eat-2 mutants
which were exposed to 0.1% DMSO (20.0 days) (p-value
= 0.006).

CR in C. elegans has
been demonstrated
to induce catalase enzyme activity and improve oxidative stress resistance,
resulting in a longer lifespan.26 Sufficient
evidence has pointed to the fact that resveratrol can mimic some aspects
of CR, and can extend the lifespan of model organisms like C. elegans, although the detailed mechanism of action
is still unknown. This study, along with research by other researchers,28,30,31 suggests that lifespan, mitochondrial
function, CR, and CR mimetics are intricately linked.

As a proof
of concept, a few novel polyketides from our compound
library were tested in mitochondrial function assays, but so far,
none of them significantly improved the mitochondrial function of
wild-type C. elegans. For instance,
when butylmalonic acid and p-coumaric acid were incorporated
into the NGM agar together with either the control or the 18xCHS E. coli construct, N2 worms exposed to the novel
polyketides, butylmalonyl-CoA, and p-coumaroyl-CoA
did not have a significantly higher basal respiration, maximal respiration,
and spare respiratory capacity compared to worms exposed to the CoA
esters only (Figure 11). Interestingly, the toxic polyketides derived from 3-chlorocinnamyl-CoA
+ malonyl-CoA and 3-(3′-chloro-4′-methoxy)phenylpropanoyl-CoA
+ methylmalonyl-CoA did not have any effect on the mitochondrial respiration
of C. elegans, suggesting that other
pathways are affected by the toxicity instead.

Figure 11 Butylmalonic acid and p-coumaric acid were incorporated
into NGM agar together with either the control (Ctrl) or 18xCHS E. coli construct. C. elegans exposed to novel polyketides and CoA esters produced by the 18xCHS E. coli construct (contains CoA ligases + 18xCHS)
do not have a higher basal respiration, maximal respiration, and spare
respiratory capacity compared to C. elegans exposed to CoA esters only (control construct contains CoA ligases
only).

Taken together, the development
of mitochondrial function assays
allows us to screen our libraries for anti-ageing compounds more efficiently
without having to conduct lengthy lifespan assays. The anti-ageing
properties of selected drug hits can subsequently be validated by
conventional lifespan assays and other functional assays.

2.7 Synthetic Enzymology in a Probiotic System
Once a promising
anti-ageing drug with minimal adverse effects
is developed, we can either deploy the drug directly in humans or
incorporate the combinatorial biosynthetic pathway (of the drug) into
a probiotic strain such as E. coli Nissle
1917. Thus, other than preventing diseases of the gastrointestinal
tract, the probiotic Nissle strain can lead to a sustainable biosynthesis
of anti-ageing drugs within the human host. Although more research
and development is required, we have taken the first steps toward
using probiotics in anti-ageing drug delivery: we have constructed
a combinatorial biosynthetic pathway involving phenylalanine ammonia
lyase (PAL) as an enzyme upstream of the acid-CoA ligases and 18xCHS.
PAL is able to deaminate endogenous phenylalanine and tyrosine to
cinnamic acid and p-coumaric acid, respectively,
while 4CL can make use of these carboxylic acids to generate starter
acyl-CoAs for 18xCHS for the biosynthesis of potential anti-ageing
compounds (Figure 12). As a proof of concept, our engineered E. coli Nissle strain is capable of producing resveratrol at 4.1 mg/L (Figure 13), a concentration
comparable to that found in red wine (average 1.9 ± 1.7 mg/L).32 Nutraceuticals are food or formulations of food
that provide health or medical benefits such as the prevention or
treatment of diseases.33 This engineered
strain of probiotic E. coli Nissle
presents a potential vehicle for delivery of anti-ageing compounds
to the human body without the need to take drugs orally or intravenously.

polyketides in E. coli Nissle.

Figure 13 HPLC profile of organic extracts from E. coli Nissle constructs grown in M9 supplemented
with 0.25 mM tyrosine.
A peak corresponding to p-coumarate is present in
extracts from Nissle constructs containing PAL and absent in the extract
from the Nissle construct with an empty vector, indicating that PAL
is active. In addition, resveratrol is produced by the Nissle construct
containing PAL, 4CL, and 18xCHS.

3 Conclusions
In summary, a major limitation
in anti-ageing therapeutic development
lies in the production of novel and bioactive lead compounds for screening.
By establishing a combinatorial biosynthetic route in E. coli and exploring the substrate promiscuity of
18xCHS, 413 potential anti-ageing compounds were biosynthesized. Resveratrol
is postulated to be a CR mimetic and has been shown to extend the
lifespan of several model organisms. Using the OCR profile of worms
exposed to 8 days of 50 μM resveratrol as a blueprint, libraries
of novel polyketides can be screened to identify potential CR mimetics.
A molecular screening platform where compound libraries are screened
in C. elegans-based mitochondrial function
assays can thus be developed. We believe that these studies will augment
current understanding toward polyketide compound library biosynthesis
and provide an additional tool for anti-ageing therapeutic development.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Reagents
The carboxylic

for acid-CoA ligases were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St. Louis,
MO, USA), Tokyo Chemical Industry Co. (Tokyo, Japan), Extrasynthese
Co. (Genay Cedex, France), and Lier Chemical Co. (Sichuan, People’s
Republic of China). A total of 81 carboxylic acids were utilized as

ligases.34 The acids were from the malonate,
cinnamate, phenylpropanoate, benzoate, phenylacetate, naphthalene,

tested are depicted in Table S1 in the Supporting Information.

4.2 Establishing a Combinatorial
Biosynthetic
Route in E. coli
The type
III PKS used in this research study is a mutant CHS with STS activity
from Medicago sativa that was previously
created by Austin et al. in 2004. Alfalfa CHS (GI: 166363) was cloned
from M. sativa cDNA library into a
modified pET-15b vector (Tom-15b vector) containing ten histidine
tags at the N-terminus of the protein. PCR-mediated mutagenesis was
conducted with reference to the paper published by Austin et al. (2004)
in order to replicate the same mutations in alfalfa CHS, resulting
in 18xCHS which has STS activity. In particular, the following sites
were mutated—D98A, V100L, V101A, V102M, T131S, S133T, G134T,
V135P, M137L, Y158V, M159G, M160V, Y161F, Q163H, L268K, K269G, D270A,
and G273D.21

The cloning of the four
acyl-CoA ligases were previously reported.34 They are MCS (GI: 3982573) from Rhizobium trifolii, phenylacetate-CoA ligase (PCL) (GI: 1102907) from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), benzoate-CoA ligase
(BZL) (GI: 1040685) from Rhodopseudomonas palustri, and 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL) (GI: 12229632) from Nicotiana tabacum. In order to establish a combinatorial
biosynthetic route in E. coli, three
CoA ligases (4CL, PCL, and BZL) involved in the generation of starter
CoA thioesters were subcloned into the multiple cloning site 1 of
a pRSFDuet-1 vector (Novagen) separately. To produce the extender
CoA thioesters, MCS and PCL were each subcloned into the MCS2 region
of the same vector. Thereafter, the constructed plasmid was co-transformed
with the Tom-15b vector containing 18xCHS into E. coli Rosetta II (DE3) strain (Novagen). Depending on the identity of
the starter and extender acids, E. coli harboring the appropriate combination of CoA ligases was used for
the in vivo precursor-directed combinatorial biosynthesis of polyketides
(see Table S1 in the Supporting Information). An E. coli construct without the
18xCHS gene was also prepared to serve as a control for the subsequent
detection of novel polyketides. A matrix of 69 starter acids and 12
extender acids were separately introduced to the engineered E. coli host cells, giving a possible combination
of 828 substrate profiles in total.

An E. coli Nissle 1917 Δalr ΔdadX strain which requires 50
μg/mL d-alanine for growth and an alr+ plasmid (pEaaK) for complementation was previously described.35 PAL (GenBank: X51513.1) from Rhodosporidium
toruloides, 4CL, and 18xCHS were cloned into the pEaaK
vector under a constitutive J23119 promoter, TTGACAGCTAGCTCAGTCCTAGGTATAATGCTAGC. E. coli Nissle 1917 Δalr ΔdadX strain complemented with the pEaaK vector construct
was grown in LB or M9 minimal medium in the absence of exogenous d-alanine.

4.3 In Vivo Precursor-Directed
Combinatorial Biosynthesis
of Polyketides and HPLC Analysis
The E. coli host cells harboring the biosynthetic genes were first grown in
LB containing 30 μg/mL kanamycin, 34 μg/mL chloramphenicol,
and 100 μg/mL ampicillin at 25 °C. When OD600nm reached 0.6, protein expression was induced by 0.1 mM isopropyl
β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 16 h. The cells
were subsequently pelleted and resuspended in M9 minimal medium containing
antibiotics, 0.1 mM IPTG, 1 mM starter acid, and 1 mM extender acid,
and incubated at 25 °C for a further 72 h. The supernatant was
acidified to pH 3.0 with 6 M HCl and extracted with ethyl acetate
thrice. The organic solvent was subsequently removed by a vacuum concentrator,
and the residue was dissolved in 100 μL DMSO for HPLC analysis.

The Atlantis analytical C18 reverse-phase column (Waters) was first
equilibrated with 10% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)
in water at a flow rate of 1 mL/min for 15 min. The sample (10 μL)
was then loaded onto the column, and the mobile phase was changed
to 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA in water under a linear gradient over
a period of 40 min at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. For the next 5 min,
a linear gradient to 100% acetonitrile containing 0.1% TFA was conducted.
The eluted compounds were detected by measuring the absorbance at
230, 280, and 320 nm. Chromatogram peaks that were present (minimum
absorbance of 20 mAU) in the extracts of constructs containing 18xCHS
but absent in the extracts of control constructs indicate the occurrence
of polyketide biosynthesis.

4.4 MS Profiling of Novel Polyketides
HPLC–MS/MS analysis of the purified polyketides was carried
out on QTOF 6550 with iFunnel and turbo ion spray, connected to UHPLC
1290 (Agilent, Singapore). The Phenomenex Synergy-Polar C18, with
a 2.1 mm × 50 mm column and a 3 μm particle size (Phenomenex,
US), was first equilibrated with 5% acetonitrile, 0.2% formic acid
in water for 1 min at a flow rate of 600 μL/min. The samples
were dissolved in 100 μL acetonitrile, and 2 μL was loaded
for the analysis. Separation of the polyketides was performed with
a gradient from 5% acetonitrile, 0.2% formic acid in water to 90%
acetonitrile, 0.2% formic acid in water over 5 min; 90% acetonitrile,
0.2% formic acid in water was then maintained for another 1 min, with
the column temperature set at 40 °C throughout the run. The mass
spectrometer was set to an MS scan range of 100–1400 m/z at 1 scan/s, and the three most intense
precursor ions were selected for fragmentation at a fixed collision
energy of 35. Data were recorded with MassHunter acquisition B6.0
(Agilent) and analyzed with MassHunter Qualitative Analysis software
version 6 (Agilent). After MS detection, NMR analyses of selected
compounds were carried out by the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Laboratory
(Department of Chemistry, National University of Singapore).

4.5 Lifespan Assays Using Resveratrol or Novel
Polyketides
Wild-type C. elegans N2 strain and eat-2 mutant strain were used in
lifespan assays. C. elegans were maintained
according to Stiernagle (2006) with minimal changes.36 Resveratrol (50 μM, TCI Co.) or DMSO (as a control)
was incorporated into 5 cm NGM agar plates by another lab member to
ensure blinding of the assays. NGM plates used for lifespan assays
also contained 90 μM FUdR (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) to ensure batch
synchrony by preventing cell division and growth in newly hatched C. elegans.37 Cultures
of E. coli OP50 strain were grown in
LB overnight at 25 °C and concentrated 10-fold by centrifugation
and resuspension in a smaller volume of LB. OP50 was then spotted
onto NGM agar plates as a food source for C. elegans and allowed to dry overnight at room temperature. C. elegans were cultured at 20 °C on the various
NGM agar plates containing a lawn of E. coli OP50. The worms were examined daily and scored as dead if no response
was observed when they were gently prodded with a platinum wire. C. elegans that were lost because of crawling on
the walls of the agar plates were omitted from analysis. Survival
analysis was conducted using the log rank test in the IBM SPSS Statistics
22 program.

For lifespan assays using novel polyketides, selected
combinations of 0.5 mM starter acids and 1 mM extender acids together
with 90 μM FUdR, 30 μg/mL kanamycin, 34 μg/mL chloramphenicol,
100 μg/mL ampicillin, and 0.1 mM IPTG were incorporated into
NGM agar plates. The corresponding CoA ligases + 18xCHS E. coli constructs and constructs without 18xCHS
were grown in LB with antibiotics overnight at 25 °C by another
lab member to ensure blinding of the lifespan studies. Protein expression
was induced by 0.1 mM IPTG for 3 h at 25 °C, and 0.5 mM starter
acids and 1 mM extender acids were subsequently introduced to the
culture. After incubation at 25 °C for another 3 h, the E. coli culture was concentrated 20-fold, seeded
onto the respective NGM plates, and allowed to dry overnight at room
temperature as the food source which can expose C.
elegans to the biosynthesized polyketides concurrently.
The lifespans of wild-type N2 C. elegans exposed to the CoA thioesters and novel polyketides were compared
to the lifespans of N2 worms exposed to CoA thioesters only, using
the log rank test.

4.6 C. elegans Respiration
Assays Using Resveratrol or Novel Polyketides
Oxygen consumption
was measured using the Seahorse XFe24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer
(Seahorse Bioscience). C. elegans were
recovered from NGM plates using M9 minimal medium and washed four
times to eliminate eggs and residual bacteria.38 The worms were transferred to 24-well seahorse islet plates
(10–25 worms in 675 μL M9 minimal medium per well) and
covered with an islet capture screen. Basal oxygen consumption was
measured for six cycles before performing carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxy-phenylhydrazone (FCCP) treatment at a
final concentration of 20 μM. Maximal oxygen consumption was
subsequently measured for eight cycles. The Kruskal–Wallis
test in the GraphPad Prism 6 program was used to determine the significance
of differences in medians. Subsequently, Dunn’s multiple comparisons
test was used to determine if the medians varied significantly between
any two selected groups.
