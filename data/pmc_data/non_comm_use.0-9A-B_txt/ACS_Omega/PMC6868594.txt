Solubility-enhancing
amorphous solid dispersions can aid in the
oral delivery of hydrophobic, poorly soluble drugs. Effective solid
dispersion excipients enable high supersaturation drug concentrations
over biologically relevant time scales. The critical characteristics
of an excipient that allow it to work well in a solid dispersion system
are not well understood. We prepared poly(N-isopropylacrylamide),
poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide), and
poly(N-hydroxyethylacrylamide) excipients of varying
molar mass and examined their ability to improve the aqueous solubility
of phenytoin, a Biopharmaceutical Class System Class II drug. Binary
and ternary solid dispersions of phenytoin and these excipients, along
with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate and hydroxypropyl
methylcellulose, were prepared at 10 wt % drug loading. Dissolution
behavior was studied at early time points (<1 min) and over the
course of 6 h. Performance of the ternary solid dispersions was largely
a function of the concentration of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)
present in micellar structures and the concentration of PNiPAm micelles
in the dissolution media. We present several systems that achieved
significant improvement of phenytoin solubility over a wide composition
range at enhancement factors among the highest seen to date for phenytoin.

Introduction
Low aqueous solubility
of emerging drugs poses an immense challenge
to the pharmaceutical industry. A pharmaceutical active’s bioavailability
is often captured in two broad-stroke properties: permeability and
solubility.1,2 The Food and Drug Administration and the
pharmaceutical industry as a whole classify most drugs by these two
characteristics in a four-quadrant Biopharmaceutical Classification
System (BCS).1 Currently, ‘ideal’
drugs that exhibit high solubility and high permeability (Class I)
make up roughly 35% of currently marketed drugs; however, only 10%
of future drug candidates in the pipeline are in Class I.3 In contrast, the vast majority (∼80%)
of future drug candidates is expected to have low aqueous solubility
(Classes II and IV),3,4 and this has driven extensive
efforts toward formulation strategies for improving their aqueous
solubility.5

Formulation of poorly
soluble drugs into amorphous solid dispersions
has been identified as a general solubility-enhancement method that
does not compromise the intestinal permeability of the pharmaceutical.6,7 Dispersing the active pharmaceutical within a polymeric solid dispersion
excipient provides several advantages for increasing drug solubility.8,9 Polymer excipients are often designed to be hydrophilic, and as
such, enhance the aqueous dispersibility of the poorly soluble drug.10 Furthermore, by introducing the amorphous form
of the drug into aqueous media upon dissolution, solid dispersions
deliver a higher-energy form of the drug with a higher solubility
than the crystalline solubility of the drug.11−13

Unfortunately,
the higher free energy of the amorphous compound
relative to its crystalline counterpart thermodynamically favors the
crystallization of the drug. As such, the choice of a suitable excipient
to stabilize the drug in both the solid and dissolved states is critical
to the success of this solubilizing method.14 While suitable excipient-drug pairs can be discovered through screening
processes, our aim is to expand the foundational understanding of
effective pharmaceutical excipients through systematic variations
of key molecular and physical properties of the excipient.

As
model drug-excipient pairs, this work focuses on phenytoin,
a BCS Class II (low solubility, high permeability) antiepileptic,
and poly(acrylamide)-based polymers. Previous work has shown several
highly effective poly(acrylamide)-based excipients for achieving and
sustaining high supersaturation levels of phenytoin (up to a 22-fold
increase over crystalline solubility).15−19 Specifically, low-molar-mass, micelle-forming poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNiPAm) homopolymer has performed
well, both on its own18 and when blended
with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS).17 Poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide-co-N-isopropylacrylamide) (PDMAm-co-PNiPAm) containing ∼70 mol % N-isopropylacrylamide has also performed well, both as free chains
and as in the corona of self-assembled micelles.16,19

This work probes the transferability of the conclusions of
previous
PNiPAm-phenytoin systems. Specifically, this work expanded on the
understanding afforded by the study of low-molar-mass (<10 kDa)
PNiPAm homopolymers that formed dispersed micelles in the aqueous
solution.18 The current understanding and
explanation for the effective solubilization behavior is that dissolved
phenytoin is stabilized within local environments of high NiPAm content.17−19 In the case of low-molar-mass reversible addition–fragmentation
chain-transfer (RAFT)-synthesized homopolymers, micellization of the
PNiPAm homopolymer (NiPAm corona, alkyl chain hydrophobic core) increases
the local PNiPAm concentration within the corona environment as compared
to free chains.17−19

Stabilization of phenytoin in PNiPAm-rich environments
may occur
because PNiPAm offers a suitable hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance that
encourages phenytoin partitioning in the corona.19 PNiPAm may also offer favorable hydrophobic interactions
between PNiPAm isopropyl groups and phenytoin aromatic rings17,19 and/or specific secondary amide-secondary amide interactions that
disrupt the fastest hydrogen-bond ribbon growth axis of phenytoin.20 Indeed, Moghadam and Larson developed all-atom
molecular dynamics simulations of NiPAm-based polymers in water in
the presence of phenytoin.21 They argue
that an advantageous balance of hydrophilic/hydrophobic character
can be accessed both in low-molar-mass PNiPAm homopolymers and in
PNiPAm co-polymers with other hydrophilic co-monomers, and that an
ideal hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance can maximize stabilizing excipient-phenytoin
contacts.

We previously evaluated PNiPAm homopolymers of varying
molar mass
and end group for supersaturation achievement and maintenance of phenytoin.18 By keeping many of the polymeric molecular details
the same, i.e., the controlled synthesis by reversible addition–fragmentation
chain-transfer polymerization, the chain-transfer agent (CTA), and
the molar mass range, in this work, we test the generalizability of
previous conclusions. These findings probed the role of the NiPAm
repeat unit specifically. By investigating binary and ternary solid
dispersions of phenytoin formulated with two structurally similar
homopolymers and two cellulosic polymers, we have increased our understanding
relating to the importance of NiPAm in the enhancement of phenytoin’s
solubility in aqueous media.

Experimental Section
Materials
All
chemicals were used as received from
the manufacturer: N-isopropylacrylamide (Sigma, >99%), N-hydroxyethylacrylamide (Sigma, 97%), N,N-dimethylacrylamide (Sigma, 99%), 4,4′-azobis(4-cyanovaleric
acid) (Sigma, >98%), 4-cyano-4-(dodecylsulfanylthiocarbonyl)sulfanylpentanoic
acid (Strem Chemical, >97%), phenytoin (Sigma, >99%), dioxane
(Sigma-Aldrich),
simulated intestinal fluid (SIF) powder (Biorelevant), and dimethyl
sulfoxide-d6 (DMSO-d6, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, 99.9% D). The cellulosic
HPMCAS and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) samples used were
AFFINISOL HPMCAS 912 G and METHOCEL E3 LV, respectively, and were
provided by the Dow Chemical Company. Cellulosic materials are often
characterized by the average number of substituent groups per glucose
repeat unit, defined as the functional group degree of substitution.
The HPMCAS sample had methoxy, hydroxypropyl, acetate, and succinate
degrees of substitution of 1.94, 0.25, 0.57, and 0.28, respectively.
This HPMCAS grade was chosen because it was independently determined
by the Dow Chemical Company to outperform all other commercial HPMCAS
grades as a solid dispersion excipient for phenytoin at a loading
of 10 wt % over 6 h. The HPMC sample had methoxy and hydroxypropyl
degrees of substitution of 1.91 and 0.25, respectively, and was chosen
for its low viscosity in water when dissolved and its intermediate
hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance. Substitution data for HPMC and HPMCAS
was provided by The Dow Chemical Company.

Synthesis of PNiPAm, PDMAm,
and Poly(N-hydroxyethylacrylamide)
(PHEAm)
The syntheses of PNiPAm, PDMAm, and PHEAm were all
performed via similar methods. A sample polymerization is given here:
NiPAm (1.275 g, 0.01127 mol), 4-cyano-4-[(octadecylsulfanylthiocarbonyl)
sulfanyl]pentanoic acid (0.500 g, 0.00102 mol), and 4,4′-azobis(4-cyanopentanoic
acid) (0.0286 g, 0.000102 mol) were added to a round-bottom flask.
Dioxane (25 mL) was added. The reaction mixture was sparged with nitrogen
gas for 45 min and then placed in an oil bath at 72 °C. After
5 h, the reaction was exposed to air. The resultant polymer was isolated
and purified by precipitation (2 times) in cooled acetone, methanol,
ethanol, or a mixture thereof. The polymer was dried under vacuum
at 40 °C overnight. Solubility of the polymers in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS, 82 mM sodium chloride, 20 mM sodium phosphate dibasic,
47 mM potassium phosphate monobasic, pH 6.5) was tested by visually
examining solutions at 9 mg mL–1.

Molecular Characterization
NMR spectroscopy was performed
on a 500 MHz Varian INOVA-500 spectrometer in DMSO-d6 with a d1 relaxation time of 10 s.

Size exclusion
chromatography (SEC) was used to determine molar masses and molar
mass distributions, using LS detectors. Full traces (Figure S1) were plotted from refractive index signals, relative
to polystyrene standards. PNiPAm and PDMAm samples were analyzed using
THF as the mobile phase, PHEAm samples were analyzed using dimethylformamide
as the mobile phase, and HPMC was analyzed using a mobile phase of
0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution supplemented with
1% acetic acid. Molar mass data for HPMCAS were provided by The Dow
Chemical Company.

Thermal Analysis
Differential scanning
calorimetry
(DSC) was performed on a Discovery DSC (TA Instruments, New Castle,
DE) equipped with a refrigerated cooling system. A dry N2 purge flowed through the cell at 50 mL min–1,
and samples were run in hermetically sealed TZero aluminum pans. Polymer
samples were dried under vacuum before DSC analysis; samples (2–10
mg) were heat–cool–heat cycled at 10 °C min–1 between −85 and 150 °C. Tg values were taken from the second heating scan. Spray-dried
dispersions were dried under vacuum before DSC analysis; samples (2–6
mg) were ramped at 5 °C min–1 from −85
to 140 °C; Tg values were taken from
the first heating scan.

Turbidity Analysis of PNiPAm Thermoresponsiveness
The
cloud points of PNiPAm-(1.3) and PNiPAm-(4.4) in the PBS solution
(w/SIF, pH 6.5) were determined by transmittance measurements. Solutions
were prepared in glass ampules at 9 mg mL–1 and
placed in the holding cell of a heating block (±1 °C). A
10 mW helium–neon laser (λ = 633 nm) passed through a
neutral density filter and then through the sample ampule. The transmitted
light was focused by a lens, and the signal was collected by a photodiode
detector. The heating rate was kept constant at 2.5 °C min–1. The cloud point was taken as the 50% transmittance
point (50% T).

Spray-Dried Dispersion Preparation
Spray-dried dispersions
were prepared at the lab scale using a mini spray dryer (Bend Research,
Bend, OR). Solid dispersions were made either as binary blends of
a homopolymer and phenytoin or ternary solid dispersions of two homopolymers
and phenytoin. For dispersion preparation, a total-solid loading of
2.0 wt % drug and polymer were dissolved in 90:10 v/v MeOH/H2O. Samples were sprayed at a constant inlet temperature (75 °C),
N2 flow rate (28.6 sL min–1), and solution
flow rate (1.3 mL min–1). Spray-dried dispersions
were collected and immediately dried under vacuum overnight and further
stored at room temperature in a vacuum desiccator.

Solid dispersions
were all made at 10 wt % phenytoin (90 wt % excipient). Binary solid
dispersions were 10 wt % phenytoin and 90 wt % of a homopolymer. Ternary
solid dispersions were 10 wt % phenytoin and 90 wt % excipient, where
the composition of the excipient was varied across 80:20, 70:30, 60:40,
40:60, and 20:80 wt:wt PNiPAm:diluent, where the diluent was PDMAm-(2.0),
PHEAm-(1.7), HPMCAS, or HPMC. Samples that are labeled as either “100:0”
or “0:100” are the binary blends of phenytoin with a
single excipient, either PNiPAm or the diluent.

Standard Dissolution
Tests
Dissolution tests were performed
in the phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS, 82 mM sodium chloride,
20 mM sodium phosphate dibasic, 47 mM potassium phosphate monobasic,
preheated to 37 °C) with 0.5 wt % simulated intestinal fluid
(SIF) powder (FaSSIF, Biorelevant) at 37 °C. In a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge
tube, appropriate amounts of spray-dried dispersion and PBS were added
to target a total drug concentration of 1000 μg mL–1. Samples were mixed on a vortex mixer (Scientific Industries Vortex-Genie
2 on a setting of 10) for 1 min to suspend all solids and then placed
(t = 0) in an isothermal sample holder held at 37
°C. At set time points (4, 10, 20, 40, 90, 180, 360 min), the
samples were centrifuged at 13 000 g for 1 min, a 50 μL
aliquot was removed from the supernatant, and the aliquot was diluted
with 300 μL of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-grade
methanol. The samples were then vortexed for 30 s to resuspend the
centrifuged solids, and the tubes were returned to the isothermal
sample holder. The drug concentration was determined by reversed-phase
high-performance liquid chromatography in 60:40 (v/v) H2O/MeCN. Samples were analyzed on an Agilent 1260 liquid chromatograph
with a multi-wavelength UV–vis detector, 1260 MWD, at 225 nm.
Separation occurred on an Agilent Poroshell 120 EC-C18 column with
120 Å pores. A calibration curve from 12.5 to 500 μg mL–1 was prepared, with an R2 value of 0.9986.

Early-Time-Point Dissolution Tests
Early-time-point
dissolution tests were performed similarly to standard dissolution
tests. Rather than the first instance of vortex mixing being for 1
min, the solution was vortexed for 15, 30, or 60 s, and the sample
was then immediately centrifuged at 13 000 g for 1 min. An
aliquot was taken, and the concentration of phenytoin was determined
as described above. Because the vortexer was on the benchtop, dissolution
was performed at 22 °C. However, significant heat loss from the
PBS was likely limited in the time frames studied.

Dynamic Light
Scattering (DLS)
Dynamic light scattering
(DLS) measurements were conducted using a Brookhaven Instruments BI-200SM
light scattering system equipped with a 637 nm laser. Samples were
prepared at a concentration of 9 mg mL–1 of the
polymer in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Samples were passed through
a 0.2 μm filter to remove dust, loaded into glass tubes, and
placed in a temperature-controlled, index-matching bath. The temperature
was held at 37 °C during measurements. Intensity autocorrelation
functions (Figure S6) spanning 1 μs
to 1 s were collected at five scattering angles of 60, 75, 90, 105,
and 120°, with an acquisition time of 10 min per angle. For each
sample, a REPES analysis was performed on the autocorrelation function
from 90°. The autocorrelation functions for samples that showed
a single population by REPES were fitted to a second-order cumulant
model and for samples that showed two populations by REPES were fitted
to a double exponential decay model. Residuals (Figure S7) between the intensity correlation functions and
the selected fits were plotted to determine the quality of the chosen
fit. The mutual diffusion coefficient, Dm, was extracted from linear fits of the mean decay rate (Γ)
vs q2 (Figure S8). Mean hydrodynamic radii (Rh) were
obtained via the Stokes–Einstein relationship. Dispersities
for the samples fit to a second-order cumulant model are given as
the average μ2/Γ2 value across all
five angles.

Results
Synthesis and Characterization
of Polymeric Excipients
The polymers highlighted here were
studied as solid dispersion excipients
in binary and ternary blends with phenytoin (Scheme 1). Synthetic solid dispersion excipients
were prepared from three different acrylamide monomers via reversible
addition–fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization.
Based on the previous work demonstrating the effectiveness of N-isopropylacrylamide as a monomer unit in several polymeric
solid dispersion excipient systems with phenytoin, the acrylamide
backbone structure was maintained in all of the synthetic polymers
studied here.15−19 Homopolymers of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNiPAm),
poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide) (PDMAm),
and poly(N-hydroxyethylacrylamide) (PHEAm) all inherited
a starting RAFT chain-transfer agent (CTA) that possessed both a carboxylic
acid terminus and a C12-alkyl chain terminus. This specific
CTA was chosen for its ability to drive micellization of low-molar-mass
polymers, as previously demonstrated with low-molar-mass PNiPAm.18 Additionally, two common commercially available
cellulosic excipients were studied: hydroxypropyl methylcellulose
acetate succinate (HPMCAS) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC)
(see the Experimental Section for more detail).

Scheme 1 Chemical Structures of Polymeric Excipients and Phenytoin
The cellulosic structures shown
are representative, where the actual placement of all substituents
is without regioselective control, and the degree of substitution
of each functionality is independently varied.

Phenytoin (Scheme 1) has a melting temperature (Tm) of 296
°C, a moderately lipophilic octanol–water partition coefficient
(log P) value of 1.92, and a solubility for
the crystalline form in DI water of 27.1 μg mL–1.22,23 The hydantoin ring of phenytoin offers two
hydrogen-bond donors and two hydrogen-bond acceptors, and the two
phenyl rings confer hydrophobic character to the molecule.

The
molecular and thermal characteristics of all polymer samples
are summarized in Table 1. Three series of low-molar-mass homopolymers were prepared based
on each acrylamide monomer. Polymers are named by their polymer abbreviation,
followed by their Mn value determined
by NMR spectroscopy, in kDa, assuming one end group per chain, for
example, PNiPAm-(1.3) indicates a PNiPAm homopolymer with an Mn value of 1.3 kDa. Mn values as determined by SEC were equivalent or larger than Mn values by NMR spectroscopy. Dispersities for
PDMAm samples were larger than typically seen for RAFT polymerizations.
DSC was used to determine the glass transition temperatures (Tg’s) of the polymers. Within each homopolymer
series, Tg values generally increased
with increasing molar mass. Tg values
for the synthetic polymers ranged from 52 to 94 °C. The cellulosic
polymers possessed Tg values over 120
°C.

To probe solubility,
each polymer sample was dissolved at 9 mg
mL–1 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 6.5)
at 37 °C. All of the samples were dissolved at 9 mg mL–1 such that no polymer particles were visually apparent (Figure S2). All PNiPAm and PDMAm samples gave
clear solutions at this concentration. HPMCAS and HPMC also formed
clear solutions at this loading and temperature. The lowest-molar-mass
PHEAm-(1.7) sample solution was clear, though all samples of higher
molar mass appeared hazy, indicating the presence of larger solution
structures.

The thermal phase transitions of the two PNiPAm
samples were studied
by turbidimetry.24−26 Cloud points of PNiPAm-(1.3) and PNiPAm-(4.4) at
9 mg mL–1 in PBS-based dissolution media (pH 6.5)
with 0.05 wt % simulated intestinal fluid powder (SIF) were determined
by transmittance (T) measurements. The cloud point (50% T) of PNiPAm-(4.4)
was 38 °C. No cloud point was detected for PNiPAm-(1.3), up to
50 °C (Figure S3). Thus, while thermoresponsive
behavior may contribute to the performance of the PNiPAm-(4.4) sample
during dissolution, no thermoresponsive behavior is expected to contribute
to the performance of the PNiPAm-(1.3) sample.

Dynamic light
scattering (DLS) was used to evaluate the presence,
size, and size distribution of solution structures that the excipients
formed in PBS (pH 6.5, w/o SIF, 37 °C). No SIF powder was added
to the PBS used for DLS to limit scattering complexities arising from
SIF lipids. Apparent size distributions are shown in Figure 1. Most samples showed random
residuals of the autocorrelation functions to the fits (Figure S7), suggesting reliability of the fitting
models chosen. A systematic error was observed for the cellulosic
polymers and the PHEAm-(4.3), -(5.6), and -(8.8) samples, indicating
that the double exponential model used does not perfectly describe
the size distributions within the solution. Plots of the mean decay
rates (Γ) vs q2 are linear with
near-zero intercepts (Figure S8), which
is consistent with the relaxation processes being diffusive. Key results
from the DLS studies in PBS are summarized in Table 2.

Both
PNiPAm samples showed two populations by REPES. The first
population was indicative of micelles, and the second population indicated
the presence of larger aggregates. All PDMAm samples showed a single
peak, suggesting only the presence of micelles, without larger aggregates.
The lowest-molar-mass PHEAm sample showed a single peak, though the
larger-molar-mass samples also showed a second population at larger
sizes of about 100 nm, which could explain the haziness seen in those
samples. HPMCAS appeared as two broad distributions around 9 and 157
nm and HPMC as a single broad distribution around 6 nm.

The
lowest molar masses of each synthetic polymer, PNiPAm-(1.3),
PDMAm-(2.0), and PHEAm-(1.7), form structures that have Rh values of 5, 4, and 5 nm, respectively. Making the assumption
that the micelle cores are dense water-free spheres, aggregation numbers
(Nagg) can be roughly estimated from the
respective Rh values, the total Mn found by NMR spectroscopy, and a bulk density.
Estimated values of Nagg for the PNiPAm-(1.3),
PDMAm-(2.0), and PHEAm-(1.7) micelles were found to be 200, 100, and
200, respectively (sample calculation included in the Supporting Information).

Spray-Dried Solid Dispersions
with Phenytoin
Solid
dispersions were formulated as binary and ternary blends of phenytoin
with either one or two polymeric excipients, respectively. The solid-state
properties of the solid dispersions were analyzed by DSC. DSC is routinely
used to quantify the crystallinity of solid dispersions; however,
the melting temperature of phenytoin is 296 °C, which is above
the degradation temperature of these polymer samples. Thus, it is
not possible to directly probe the crystallinity of these solid dispersions
by DSC. DSC can also be used to probe the miscibility of the drug
within the polymer. A single glass transition temperature (Tg) was seen for all of the solid dispersions,
consistent with the drug being molecularly dispersed within the excipient,
with Tg values in the range of 54–99
°C (Table S1). Long-term stability
of these solid dispersions would benefit from higher solid dispersion Tg’s, typically imparted by higher amounts
of the cellulosic polymers relative to the lower-Tg polyacrylamides.

During dissolution testing, the
solid dispersions studied were introduced to PBS with SIF powder to
mimic intestinal conditions. Under in vitro conditions, the concentration
of phenytoin loaded was kept constant at 1000 μg mL–1 by loading the SDD at 10 000 μg mL–1 (polymer loading at 9 mg mL–1). The loaded drug
concentration is significantly above the aqueous solubility of crystalline
phenytoin (27.1 μg mL–1) and below its estimated
amorphous solubility (1280 μg mL–1).27 This loading concentration was chosen to push
the limits of supersaturation without approaching the amorphous solubility,
thus avoiding liquid–liquid phase separation phenomena described
by Taylor and others.28 Sink dissolution
conditions are met when the volume of dissolution medium is at least
3–10 times the volume that would give the drug’s saturation
concentration at the given drug loading; at the determined loading
of 1000 μg mL–1 loading, the target drug concentration
is relatively close to its estimated amorphous solubility, and, thus,
the conditions we use are considered nonsink by the above definition.29

Under routine dissolution conditions,
dissolution vials were loaded
with solid dispersion; PBS (w/SIF) was introduced (the addition of
PBS marked t = 0) and the vials were immediately
mixed using a vortex mixer for 60 s at room temperature. The samples
were placed in an isothermal holder maintained at 37 °C. The
concentration of dissolved phenytoin was then evaluated at 4, 10,
20, 40, 90, 180, and 360 min after initial placement in the isothermal
holder. At each time point, the concentration of phenytoin was determined
by centrifuging down any suspended solids, taking an aliquot of the
supernatant, evaluating the concentration via reversed-phase HPLC
(post-dissolution in methanol), and resuspending any solids by mixing
on the vortex mixer for 60 s. The dissolution vial was then placed
back into the isothermal holder until the next time point. The withdrawn
medium was not replaced with a new medium after sampling so as to
not disrupt the structures in the solution.

Early-time-point
data was added to the routine dissolution profiles
to increase the temporal resolution of the dissolution experiments.
In a similar manner to the routine dissolution conditions, dissolution
vials were loaded with solid dispersion. PBS (w/SIF) was added to
the dissolution vials (this addition marked t = 0).
The vials were then mixed using a vortex mixer for either 15, 30,
or 60 s at room temperature (∼22 °C). The vials were then
immediately centrifuged, and the concentration of phenytoin was determined
as above. Each early-time-point sample was a singular time point from
a separate sample, with no resuspension or later time points taken.

Dissolution of Binary Solid Dispersions with Micelle-Forming
Homopolymers as Excipients
Binary solid dispersions of phenytoin
with micelle-forming homopolymers as the solid dispersion excipients
were studied to elucidate the effect of monomer type and molar mass
on the dissolution performance of phenytoin. To enable a comparison
against the previous work, dissolution studies using PNiPAm-(1.3)
and PNiPAm-(4.4) are shown in Figure 2a, with added early-time-point resolution in Figure S4.

wt % phenytoin with 90 wt
% (a) PNiPAm, (b) PDMAm, (c) PHEAm homopolymers, and (d) HPMCAS and
HPMC. In all plots, the dissolution profile of crystalline phenytoin
is also included as a reference (open circles). The loaded concentration
of phenytoin was 1000 μg mL–1 (indicated with
the dashed line). The dissolution was run in triplicate. The data
shown are the mean values, and the error bars represent the range
of data. (a) Adapted from ref (18) with permission (Copyright 2019 American Chemical Society).

The PDMAm homopolymer series was designed to probe
the general
ability of a micelle-forming homopolymer with an amide functionality
to achieve and maintain a high supersaturation of phenytoin. Dissolution
of PDMAm samples (Figure 2b) showed a limited increase in apparent solubility of phenytoin
over its crystalline form. These results suggest that <500 μg
mL–1 phenytoin was released into the dissolution
media. However, early-time-point data for the PDMAm samples revealed
a full release of phenytoin (Figure 3) for the two lowest-molar-mass PDMAm samples at the
shortest vortex times. Decreased phenytoin concentrations were seen
at longer vortex times, indicating that crystallization is occurring
rapidly, even during the vortexing process. At higher PDMAm molar
masses, the effect of the hydrophobic alkyl tail is minimized, and
the resultant polymer becomes more hydrophilic. Thus, while the higher
molar mass samples did not show the same high initial concentrations
of phenytoin as the lowest-molar-mass samples did, it is likely that
these also fully released the phenytoin, but that phenytoin crystallized
even before these early aliquots were taken.

wt % PDMAm: (A) PDMAm-(2.0), (B) PDMAm-(3.3), (C) PDMAm-(5.6), (D)
PDMAm-(6.5), (E) PDMAm-(11.3). All x-axes are presented
in the log scale to make the initial time points easier to visualize.
The dissolution profile of crystalline phenytoin was also included
as a reference (black open circles). The loaded concentration of phenytoin
was 1000 μg mL–1 (indicated with the dashed
line).

When compared with the PNiPAm
systems previously studied,18 all PNiPAm
and PDMAm samples contained amide
functionality in the monomer structure were fully dispersed at 9 mg
mL–1, formed micelles, and were able to achieve
a full release of loaded phenytoin upon dissolution at short times.
However, the PDMAm samples were not able to maintain the high level
of phenytoin concentration. Thus, the attributes listed alone do not
lead to generalized excipient features that can maintain high supersaturation
of phenytoin, and PNiPAm remains an anomaly.

The PHEAm homopolymer
series was designed to probe the generality
of aqueous-dispersed, low-molar-mass excipients that formed micelles
and possessed hydrogen-bond donating abilities at the amide functionality
(unlike PDMAm). This secondary amide character matched the secondary
isopropylacrylamide of the best-performing excipient and had the potential
to probe the role of the combined amide carbonyl and hydrogen-bond
donors. Again, this series probed the potential effect across molar
masses, ranging from 2 to 9 kDa.

Dissolution of the PHEAm-based
spray-dried samples also revealed
minimal solubility enhancement of phenytoin over its crystalline solubility
(Figure 2c). Early-time-point
data (Figure S5) was less revealing of
early time dissolution than seen for the PDMAm series. Our efforts
have revealed that the elements of small micelles, polymer solubility,
hydrogen-bond donors, and secondary amide functionality are not generalizable
to excipients beyond PNiPAm for maintaining supersaturation of phenytoin.

Phenytoin was also formulated into solid dispersions with HPMCAS
and HPMC for comparative purposes. Together, routine dissolution and
early-time-point studies (Figure 4) of these systems revealed peak dissolution within
minutes and subsequent crystallization over 6 h. Notably, the complete
dissolution seen in early time points for HPMC was not detected in
the routine dissolution studies (Figure 2d). This finding stresses the importance
of capturing the full release profile when designing and drawing conclusions
from dissolution experiments, especially early time data for hydrophilic
excipients and excipient blends.

time points easier to visualize. In all plots, the routine dissolution
profiles are included as filled in circles. The dissolution profile
of crystalline phenytoin was also included as a reference. The loaded
concentration of phenytoin was 1000 μg mL–1.

Area-under-the-curve (AUC) integrations
are commonly used to quantitatively
compare the effectiveness of a solid dispersion to increase the solubility
of a drug. Enhancement factors (EFs) here are defined as a simple
ratio of AUC over 6 h (AUC6h) of the solid dispersion to
the AUC6h of pure phenytoin. Based on the target of 1000
μg mL–1 of phenytoin for 6 h, the maximum
EF possible is 22.1. The attained EFs can be related to the fraction
of the target, expressed as FET, or a
percentage, expressed as FET• 100%. The EFs and FET• 100% values for all binary blends are included in Figure 5. Only three samples achieved
EF values above 5: PNiPAm-(1.3), PNiPAm-(4.4), and HPMCAS. In the
case of PNiPAm-(1.3), the FET• 100% reached 97%.

Figure 5 Enhancement factors and FET• 100 (%) values for all binary blends. The target
of 1000 μg
mL–1 of phenytoin corresponds to a maximum EF possible
of 22.1, which is represented by the top dotted line. The bottom dotted
line represents an EF value of 1, as set by the solubility of crystalline
phenytoin over 6 h.

Dissolution of Ternary
Solid Dispersions: Phenytoin with Blends
of Micelle-Forming Homopolymers
Given that PNiPAm-(1.3) was
the highest performing material in the samples studied, ternary solid
dispersions were formulated with PNiPAm-(1.3) and various diluent
excipients to probe the importance of PNiPAm content within small
micelles for the dissolution enhancement seen in the PNiPAm/phenytoin
binary system. By blending phenytoin with PNiPAm and a diluent solid
dispersion excipient, we were able to evaluate how the dissolution
enhancement relates to the presence and density of NiPAm chains in
the micelle. The first two diluents used were PDMAm-(2.0) and PHEAm-(1.7).
For these low-molar-mass synthetic polymers, the fully stretched length
of the resultant micelle corona chains is roughly equivalent, given
their similar degrees of polymerization. Also, since PNiPAm-(1.3),
PDMAm-(2.0), and PHEAm-(1.7) are all synthesized from the same RAFT
chain-transfer agent, the micellization of these homopolymers and
mixtures of these homopolymers are assumed to be similarly driven
by the association of the common C12 alkyl tail.

For blends of A–B and B–C block polymers, where B is
considered insoluble in the solution and A and C are soluble, phase
diagrams can describe and predict the thermodynamics favoring either
mixed micelles with intermixed A and C coronas or mixtures of ordinary
micelles with pure A and C coronas.30 In
these systems, we take A and C to be the repeating monomer units and
B to be the common C12 alkyl core. At these low molar masses,
we posit that χN between A (PNiPAm) and C (either
PDMAm or PHEAm as the diluent) is sufficiently low that A/C mixing
is favorable, and that mixed micelles are formed. With the added compatiblizing
effect of water, the enthalpic driving force for A/C segregation of
these short blocks is likely insufficient to override the entropic
driving force to mix. Thus, dissolved samples of PNiPAm:PDMAm and
PNiPAm:PHEAm blends are presumed to exist as mixed micelles with a
common C12 hydrophobic core and a mixed corona of PNiPAm
and PDMAm or PHEAm. Thus, the amount of NiPAm within the corona is
expected to decrease for the mixed PNiPAm:PDMAm and PNiPAm:PHEAm systems.

To probe the solution structures formed in the absence of phenytoin,
blends of the polymers at 100:0, 80:20, 70:30, 60:40, 40:60, 20:80,
and 0:100 wt:wt PNiPAm:diluent were dissolved in PBS (w/o SIF, pH
6.5, 37 °C) (Figure 6) and evaluated by DLS. For both PNiPAm:PDMAm (Figure 6A) and PNiPAm:PHEAm blends
(Figure 6B), a single
structure with an Rh of 4 to 5 nm remained
evident in all samples. The larger structure seen for PNiPAm alone
remained in all blends, and the size increased over ∼30 nm
with increasing diluent present (Rh of
28 nm for pure PNiPAm, Rh of 57 nm for
PNiPAm:PDMAm 20:80, Rh of 57 for PNiPAm:PHEAm
20:80). DLS results are summarized in Table 3.

Dissolution studies of the PNiPAm:PDMAm and PNiPAm:PHEAm ternary
solid dispersions revealed that these two blend series showed nearly
identical release profiles (Figure 7A,B). The similar abilities of these systems to achieve
and maintain supersaturations of phenytoin over 6 h suggests similar
mechanisms for phenytoin stability in the solution. The performance
was essentially mirrored for the same wt:wt values across both systems.
Thus, the performance of these blends was likely related to the fraction
of PNiPAm present in the micelles and essentially independent of the
diluent chains. When lowering the PNiPAm content relative to the diluent,
crystallization was evident for both systems by the 6 h time point
for the 60:40 PNiPAm:diluent composition. At all PNiPAm contents higher
than 60:40 wt:wt PNiPAm:diluent, AUCs above 15 (FET• 100 (%) values above 68%) were
reached.

Figure 7 Dissolution of solid dispersions of 10 wt % phenytoin and blends
of (A) PNiPAm-(1.3) and PDMAm-(2.0), (B) PNiPAm-(1.3) and PHEAm-(1.7).
In all plots, the dissolution profile of crystalline phenytoin was
also included as a reference (open circles). The loaded concentration
of phenytoin was 1000 μg mL–1. The data shown
are the mean values, and the error bars represent the range of data.

Since both PDMAm and PHEAm are considerably more
hydrophilic than
PNiPAm, we hypothesize that the micelle coronae become too hydrophilic
to encourage the partitioning of phenytoin within them. Thus, the
stabilizing effect and solubilization enhancement of PNiPAm are decreased,
regardless of whether that stabilizing effect is simply due to a hydrophobic/hydrophilic
balanced environment that does not promote phenytoin crystallization
or if it is due to specific, crystallization-disrupting phenytoin–PNiPAm
interactions.

Dissolution of Ternary Solid Dispersions:
Phenytoin with Micelle-Forming
PNiPAm and Cellulosic Polymers
Ternary mixtures of phenytoin
with PNiPAm and either HPMCAS or HPMC were also prepared. REPES analysis
of the PNiPAm:HPMCAS (Figure 8A) and PNiPAm:HPMC (Figure 8B) blends showed two discrete populations contributed
from each polymer. For the PNiPAm:HPMCAS blends, three species were
apparent by REPES. The intermediate-sized population seen for the
blends likely captured both the larger PNiPAm aggregates and the smaller
HPMCAS aggregates. As the smallest PNiPAm population remains constant
in size during the addition of HPMCAS, it is readily posited that
mixing of HPMCAS into the PNiPAm micelle structure does not occur.

Figure 8 Apparent
micellar distributions of polymer blends of (A) PNiPAm-(1.3)
and HPMCAS, and (B) PNiPAm-(1.3) and HPMC, co-dissolved in PBS (pH
6.5) at a total polymer loading of 9 mg mL–1. The
scattering angle is 90°. Samples are given as wt:wt PNiPAm:diluent,
where 100:0 and 0:100 samples are a single polymer.

For the PNiPAm:HPMC blends, two populations from PNiPAm were
seen,
and the smaller one overlapped in size with the single peak seen for
HPMC. With decreasing PNiPAm content, the presence of the larger PNiPAm-only
aggregates decreased relative to the smaller, shared PNiPAm-and-HPMC
peak. Because of the overlapping populations seen for PNiPAm and HPMC,
definitive conclusions are difficult to make about the mixing of these
species. Summarized DLS results are included in Table 3. The autocorrelation functions of all blends
were fit with a double exponential decay fitting. For the samples
with three populations, the systematic error seen in the residuals
suggests that the double exponential fitting was not completely appropriate.
Scattering intensity scales with Rh6, such that we expect the larger populations were present
in a very small amount relative to the smaller populations.31

The PNiPAm:HPMCAS and PNiPAm:HPMC ternary
systems allowed us to
probe how the dilution of PNiPAm micelles, in general, not necessarily
in a micelle corona as above, affected the ability of the ternary
solid dispersions to achieve and maintain phenytoin supersaturation.
Because HPMCAS and HPMC are water-soluble polymers that each achieve
full, near-immediate release of phenytoin in binary blends (Figure 4A,B, respectively),
their presence should not limit the ability of a PNiPAm-based ternary
solid dispersion to achieve high initial supersaturations. Dissolution
studies of PNiPAm:HPMCAS and PNiPAm:HPMC are shown in Figure 9A,B. The PNiPAm:diluent cellulosic
ternary systems were able to maintain supersaturation of phenytoin
to a lower PNiPAm composition than seen for the mixed micelle ternary
systems. EFs above 15 were seen down to a PNiPAm content of 40:60
PNiPAm:diluent. Even just 20:80 PNiPAm:HPMC offered significant solubility
enhancement and delayed crystallization over pure HPMC.

Figure 9 Dissolution

of (A) PNiPAm-(1.3) and HPMCAS, (B) PNiPAm-(1.3) and HPMC. In all
plots, the dissolution profile of crystalline phenytoin was also included
as a reference (open circles). The loaded concentration of phenytoin
was 1000 μg mL–1. The data shown are the mean
values, and the error bars represent the range of data.

Diluting the relative amount of PNiPAm micelles with HPMCAS
and
HPMC did less to invoke crystallization over 6 h than directly diluting
NiPAm within the micelle coronas with PDMAm and PHEAm. The difference
in observed crystallization in these systems suggests that it is the
concentration of PNiPAm specifically within the micelles that is critical
to the supersaturation sustainment seen for these systems.

Solubility
Enhancement across Series
The EFs for all
ternary blends are included in Figure 10. Within each ternary series, four or five
blends provided solubility enhancement factors over 15, among the
highest seen to date for phenytoin. While the 80:20, 70:30, and 60:40
PNiPAm:diluent blends have near identical EFs across each diluent,
differences can be seen at the 40:60 and 20:80 ratios.

factors (EF) and FET• 100 (%) values for ternary blends of PNiPAm-(1.3)
and a diluent of (A) PDMAm-(2.0), (B) PHEAm-(1.7), (C) HPMCAS, and
(D) HPMC. Compositions are denoted by their respective PNiPAm/diluent
wt/wt ratio. The engineering target of 1000 μg mL–1 of phenytoin corresponds to a maximum EF possible of 22.1.

Further illuminating the role of PNiPAm relative
to the diluent, Figure 11 relates the mol
of NiPAm per mol of phenytoin in the solid dispersion to the EFs seen
for all ternary blends. All samples outperform a simple average mixing
behavior (with the exception of 20:80 PNiPAm:HPMCAS, which showed
minimal crystallization retardation relative to a binary solid dispersion
with HPMCAS). Although the EFs were generally above a simple averaging,
it is unlikely that these effects were due to synergistic behavior
between PNiPAm and the diluent. Furthermore, since the performance
of the PNiPAm:PDMAm and PNIPAm:PHEAm systems was nearly identical,
the results seem to be independent of the diluent polymer, which also
argues against synergy. Rather, there seems to be both a critical
density of PNiPAm within micelles and a critical amount of PNiPAm
total, both are necessary to maintain high supersaturations of phenytoin
in the solution.

Discussion
The
solubility of a solute, such as a drug molecule, in water largely
depends on two independent characteristics: the crystallinity of the
solute and the ability of the solute to favorably interact with water.32 These two molecular characteristics are often
captured in two physical properties, Tm and log P. Although these two physical properties
can vary independently of each other, in combination they can be used
to predict the solubility of the solid solute in water (SWsolid) through
an empirically derived general solubility equation33 1  where Tm is the
melting temperature in degrees Celsius.

This general solubility
equation allows for the relative contribution
of the crystallinity of the solute and its ability to interact with
water to be weighed against each other with respect to overall solubility.
Samples with high Tm values are often
highly crystalline, and samples with high log P values strongly prefer nonpolar environments over aqueous environments.
These two qualities are, in fact, independent of each other, though,
particularly in pharmaceuticals, there are often groupings of bioactive
molecules within subspaces based on similar structural components.

Poorly soluble molecules with Tm values
above 200 °C and with log P values below
2 are said to have “solid-state-limited solubility”,
because in their solid state, these molecules form dense crystal lattices
with strong, tightly associated intermolecular interactions.34,22 The poor solubility of these molecules is mostly a function of the
crystallinity of the compound, rather than a significant hydrophobic
character. In this way, a moderately hydrophobic compound can have
extremely poor aqueous solubility.

In contrast, poorly soluble
molecules, which are more lipophilic
(log P > 3) and have lower-Tm values, often show solvation-limited solubility, where
poor interactions of the compound with water means that hydration
of the compound is unfavorable. The higher lipophilicity of these
compounds promotes self-aggregation over mixing into water, also contributing
to their poor water solubility.34,35

Unfortunately,
while solubility-enhancement studies often look
at poorly soluble compounds, we believe that there should be a better
separation between mechanisms of observed solubility enhancement based
on these more underlying solubility-defining physical properties.
While the terms “poorly soluble” in water and “hydrophobic”
are often interchanged, these two qualities are not precisely synonymous.
It is reasonable to posit that during the development of solubility-enhancing
methods, compounds with solid-state solubility challenges would behave
substantially differently from those with poor solvation-state solubility.
In support of this, notably more solvation-limited-solubility drugs
have been formulated and brought to the commercial market than solid-state-limited-solubility
drugs.36

As mentioned, solid dispersions
are known to offer several strategic
advantages toward improving the solubility of a poorly soluble drug.
These advantages include: (1) introducing the more-soluble amorphous
form of the drug upon dissolution and (2) improving wettability/solvation
by using hydrophilic excipient. Between these two advantages, it has
been noted that strong crystallizer compounds (sometimes referred
to as solid-state-limited solubility compounds) benefit more from
predissolution amorphization than improved wettability.34 In contrast, hydrophobic compounds are referred
to as being solvation limited, where improved wettability through
excipient choice adds more benefit than predissolution amorphization.
We posit that the key to dissolution improvement of solid-state-limited-solubility
molecules, like phenytoin, involves inhibiting the dissolved drug
molecules from reforming intermolecular self-associations. The amorphous
character afforded during spray drying inherently limits the crystalline
character of the compound; the key is limiting crystallization-driving
self-associations in the solution once the drug is dispersed. In this
work, solid dispersion excipient systems that offered a threshold
amount of PNiPAm-dense micelle coronas were able to delay crystallization
of phenytoin over 6 h, giving insight to a possible platform for similar
solid-state-limited-solubility molecules in the future.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we studied the relative importance of PNiPAm and
its molecular properties for the dissolution enhancement of phenytoin.
By specifically varying the chemical moieties of poly(acrylamide)-based
homopolymers, we probed the relative importance of different properties
with respect to solid dispersions achieving a full release of phenytoin
with prolonged supersaturation. We synthesized PDMAm and PHEAm homopolymers
that formed aqueous-dispersed micelles in the solution, with the aim
of understanding the generality of poly(acrylamide)-based polymers
to maintain phenytoin in the solution. Although no further homopolymers
were identified as high-performing excipients with respect to maintaining
supersaturation of phenytoin, we were able to design ternary systems
that fully released phenytoin immediately upon dissolution. Through
the formulation of ternary blends composed of phenytoin, PNiPAm, and
a diluent of PDMAm, PHEAm, HPMCAS, or HPMC, it was revealed that two
critical components were necessary for full sustainment of phenytoin
supersaturations: (1) a high density of NiPAm within the micelle corona
and (2) a critical concentration of PNiPAm micelles in the dissolution
solution. These results will hopefully help guide future development
of excipients with stabilizing functionalities in a highly dense formation,
potentially for use with other solid-state-limited-solubility drugs.
