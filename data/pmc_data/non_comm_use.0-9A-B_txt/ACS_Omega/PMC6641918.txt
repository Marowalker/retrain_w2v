The dihydrogen-binding
ability of polyatomic oxohalo anions ClO–, ClO2–, ClO3–, ClO4–, BrO–, BrO2–, BrO3–, and BrO4– has been
studied at the M06L/6-311++G(d,p) density functional theory and the
CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ//CCSD/aug-cc-pVDZ ab initio theory. The maximum
number of dihydrogen adsorbed by the anions (nmax) varies from 17 to 24 in the first coordination shell.
As the number of H2 adsorbed varies from 1 to nmax, the oxochloro and oxobromo anions show a wide range
for interaction energy (Eint), namely,
1.5–45.4 kcal/mol for the former and 1.4–46.0 kcal/mol
for the latter. These results indicate that both series of anions
show very similar and high affinity to bind with several dihydrogen
molecules. Further, an increase in the coordination ability and a
decrease in the strength of the dihydrogen interaction are observed
with an increase in the number of oxygen atoms in the polyatomic anion.
In contrast, the neutral oxohaloacids show negligible interaction
with dihydrogen. The anion···H2 noncovalent
interactions along with H···H dihydrogen interactions
within the complex are ascertained by locating the bond critical points
(bcps) in the quantum theory of atoms in molecules analysis. The electron
density at the bcp summed up for all of the anion···H2 interactions (∑ρbcp) showed a strong
linear relationship with Eint, indicating
that the stability of the complex is due to the formation of a large
network of noncovalent bonds in the complex. The amount of electron
density donated by the anion to the dihydrogen during complex formation
is also gauged from the molecular electrostatic potential values at
the nuclei (Vn) of all of the atoms in
the anion. The hydrogen uptake leads to a significant reduction in
the negative character of Vn, and the
total change in Vn from all of the anion
atoms (∑ΔVn) is found to
be directly proportional to Eint. The
polyatomic anions have a very high affinity toward dihydrogen binding,
which can be utilized for the development of new hydrogen storage
systems.

Introduction
Hydrogen is an admirable
replacement for nonrenewable fossil fuels,
although its low energy density by volume encumbers the development
of efficient storage systems and limits its use as a fuel for automotive
purposes.1−4 Very recently, we have shown that molecular anions such as F–, Cl–, Br–, OH–, NH2–, NO2–, CN–, and ClO– possess remarkable ability to bind with a very large number of H2 molecules (12–20).5 These
studies conducted using the coupled cluster CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ//CCSD/6-311++G(d,p)
theory and the M06L/6-311++G(d,p) level density functional theory
(DFT) showed that even for the highest number of H2 coordinated
anionic complexes, the observed interaction energy per H2 (Eint/H2) was substantial
(2.09–4.24 kcal/mol) and the weight percent of H2 was very high (40–65 wt %), signifying that these anions
could be incorporated for the development of novel hydrogen storage
systems. We also showed that anionic and dianionic carbon chains exhibit
a massive ability to bind dihydrogen (45.3–62.8 wt %) compared
with their neutral analogues.6 These findings
suggest that the interaction of molecular hydrogen (dihydrogen) with
anions is of great significance for developing novel storage materials.

Several groups have investigated the dihydrogen adducts of halide
ions in the past, with a focus on bonding, structural, and spectral
properties. However, in these studies, the H2 storage ability
of anions has not been conferred. A high level ab initio study by
Simons et al.7 reported a linear structure
for F–···H2 complex. Boldyrev
et al. reported the ab initio vibration–rotation–tunneling
spectra and dynamics of F–···H2 and its isotopomers.8 The ab initio
calculations on the photoelectron spectra of FH2– has been reported by Hartke and Werner.9 Theoretical studies on lower bend-stretch structures Cl–···H2 and its isotopomers have also been
reported.10 In a series of studies, Bieske
and co-workers used experimental infrared spectral and vibration predissociation
data along with theoretically derived potential energy and dipole
moment data to interpret the mechanism of halide···H2 complex formation in acid–base proton transfer reactions.11−20 Later, researchers started studying X–···H2 interactions focussing on the H2 storage ability
of anions. Nyulasi and Kovács have studied the F–(H2)n and Cl–(H2)n (n =
1–8) anionic complexes at the MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ and CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ
levels of theory.21 The natural bond orbital
analysis done by them suggested charge transfer from the halide ion
to the σ*(H2) orbital. The strength of F–···H2 interactions decreased with an increase
in the number of H2, whereas that of Cl–···H2 showed negligible dependence on the
number of H2. Recently, the structural and bonding properties
of F–(H2)n (n = 1–6), Cl–(H2)n (n = 1–6),
and Br–(H2)n (n = 1–7) complexes have been investigated
using the DFT calculations by Pichierri.22 The bonding features studied by the quantum theory of atoms in molecule
(QTAIM) analysis showed the presence of a closed-shell interactions,
and the interaction energy (Eint) for
F–(H2), Cl–(H2), and Br–(H2) complexes were found
to be 7.1, 2.2, and 1.7 kcal/mol, respectively. The ab initio studies
on charge-separated ammonium fluorides have established naked F– as good binding sites for H2 physisorption.23 The electrostatic analysis of X–···H2 (X = F, Cl, Br, and I) complexes
at different levels of theory reported by Vitillo et al. suggests
that the electrostatic term predominates in the complexation energy
of the adduct.24 In another theoretical
work by Lochan and Head-Gordon, the interaction of H2 with
certain anionic ligands such as CN–, NC–, F–, SO42–, Cp–, and so on have been discussed at MP2/6-31G** method.25 According to them, the lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital of the H2 accepts electron density from the anion,
which induces a dipole on H2 and results in a charge-induced
dipole interaction in the complex. The Eint of the complexes was in the range 1.9–8.1 kcal/mol and the
binding affinities followed the order NC– < CN– < Cp– < SO42– < F– for the tested anions.
In all of the previous studies, the maximum number of H2 that can be accommodated in the first coordination shell of the
anion has not been explored. Recently, in our study focusing on the
ability of anions to bind dihydrogen, the complete first coordination
shell saturation of selected anions have been unveiled at the M06L/6-311++G(d,p)
level of density functional theory, along with insights from the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ//CCSD/6-311++G(d,p)
level of theory. The maximum number of H2 accommodated
in the first coordination shell was found to be 12, 16, 20, 15, 15,
16, 16, and 17 for F–, Cl–, Br–, OH–, NH2–, NO2–, CN–, and ClO–, respectively.5 Later,
similar results have been obtained for anionic carbon chains. For
instance, HC6– showed an uptake of 30
H2 molecules with a total interaction energy 50.0 kcal/mol.
In general, the strength of the anion–H2 interactions
decreased with an increase in the size of the anion, whereas the number
of H2 accommodated in the coordination sphere of the anion
increased with an increase in the size of the anion. However, a systematic
study on the size effect on the H2 uptake of anions is
yet to be conducted. Here, we undertake such a study using a similar
set of anions showing systematic increase in size. The selected anions
are ClO–, ClO2–, ClO3–, ClO4–, BrO–, BrO2–, BrO3–, and BrO4–; their
size increases with increase in the number of oxygen atoms.

Results
and Discussion
Geometry and Energetics of XOm–(H2)n Complexes
The oxohalo anion complexes XOm–(H2)n of all
of the anions have been systematically optimized from n = 1 to nmax (total 175 structures).
A representative set of optimized geometries of the complexes are
given in Figures 1 and S1. H2 binds preferably to the oxygen
atoms than to X. For instance, in the case of complexes of ClO–, the dihydrogen binding takes place only at the oxygen
center for complexes with n = 1–9. Binding
of H2 to X occurs only after the saturation of the oxygen
atoms. This observation holds true for all of the other polyatomic
anions except ClO4– and BrO4– in which the halogen site is not available for
H2 binding due to the tetrahedral arrangement of oxygen
atoms around the halogen atom. The O···H interaction
distance of polyatomic anions increases with increase in the number
of oxygen atoms. These interaction distances are presented in Tables S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information.
The X···H interaction distances increase with rise
in n both for ClOm– and BrOm– series. Also, the O···H interaction distance is found
to fall in similar range for both series. The O···H
distances of n = 1 complexes of ClO–, ClO2–, ClO3–, and ClO4– are 1.849, 2.039, 2.226,
and 2.302 Å, respectively, and those of BrO–, BrO2–, BrO3–, and BrO4– are 1.861, 2.056, 2.217,
and 2.335 Å, respectively. In general, the O···H
distances increases with increase in n, with a few
exceptions. For instance, the O···H distance of ClO–(H2)10 (2.339 Å) is higher
than that of ClO–(H2)11 (2.301
Å). The ClOm– complexes
show a shorter X···H distance compared with the BrOm– series. For example,
the X···H distance in ClO–(H2)11 and BrO–(H2)11 is 2.764 and 3.019 Å, respectively. The H–H
bond is found to be activated in complexes with lower n values, which is evident from the increased H–H bond distance
(the H–H bond distance of H2 molecule at the M06L/6-311++G(d,p)
level is 0.744 Å). For instance, the H–H distance of ClO–(H2)n complexes
decreases from 0.791 to 0.751 Å as n increases
from 1 to 17. Similarly, for BrO–(H2)n, the H–H distance is in the range
0.788–0.751 Å with variation in n. The
complexes with n > 10 show the H–H distance
in the range 0.754–0.748 Å (Table S3, Supporting Information). The nmax of polyatomic anions depends on the size of the anion. The BrOm– anions have higher coordination
ability than ClOm– by
1–2 H2 molecules. The nmax value is enhanced with an increase in the number of oxygen atoms
in the anion. The nmax of ClO– is 17, which increases to 22, 23, and 24, respectively, for ClO2–, ClO3–, and
ClO4– anions. Similarly, the nmax of BrO–, BrO2–, BrO3–, and BrO4– anions are 19, 22, 24, and 24, respectively.

(the average bond distances in angstrom are given in the figure).

The basis set superposition error
(BSSE)-corrected Eint of a set of selected
ClOm–(H2)n and
BrOm–(H2)n systems are given in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.
The rest of the values are shown in Table S4, Supporting Information. The Eint of
XOm–(H2)n increases with increase in n. For complexes of ClO–, ClO2–, ClO3–, and ClO4–, Eint varies from 5.4 to 44.8, 3.4 to
45.4, 1.9 to 41.2, and 1.5 to 38.4 kcal/mol as n increases
from 1 to nmax. Also, for a particular
value of n, Eint decreases
with increase in the number of oxygen atoms for both series. The Eint per H2 (Eint/H2) of all of the complexes are given in Table 3. For complexes of
ClO– and ClO2–, Eint/H2 decreases from 5.4 to 2.6
and 3.4 to 2.1 kcal/mol, respectively. The Eint/H2 does not vary much with variation in n for ClO3– and ClO4– anions, falling in the range 1.8–2.1 and
1.2–1.7 kcal/mol, respectively. These observations also remain
true in the case of BrOm–(H2)n complexes. The Eint of any ClOm–(H2)n complex
is comparable with the that of the corresponding BrOm–(H2)n complex. The correlation graphs (Figures 2 and S2) show
that Eint is directly proportional to n for all of the series with the correlation coefficient R in the range 0.984–0.998. The slopes and intercepts
of ClOm– series are
very much similar to those of BrOm– series. Slope of the correlation plots shows a declining
trend with an increase in the number of oxygen atoms in the anion.
As the number of oxygen atoms increases, the size of the anion increases
and as a result the charge density per atom of the monoanion decreases.
Thus, the H2-binding ability is lowered in bigger anions,
which is reflected in the Eint and slope
of correlation plots.

In a previous benchmark study, the M06L/6-311++G(d,p)
method is
rated as one of the most reliable DFT methods to reproduce the geometry
and interaction energy of CCSD(T) level results for noncovalently
bonded small molecular dimers. Herein, Eint/H2 computed at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ//CCSD/aug-cc-pVDZ
level for ClOm–(H2)n and BrOm–(H2)n complexes (n = 1–5; m =
1–4), depicted in Tables 4 and 5, shows close agreement
between the ab initio and the M06L/6-311++G(d,p) DFT levels. Moreover,
structural features of the complexes too agreed very well at both
levels of theory. Compared with the anions, the neutral oxohaloacids
HClO, HClO2, HClO3, HBrO, HBrO2,
and HBrO3 show very low H2-binding affinity
in the range 0.37–0.45 kcal/mol for the uptake of one H2 molecule. Their ability to bind with multiple H2 is negligible. The oxohaloacids of ClO4– and BrO4– (HClO4 and HBrO4) show Eint of 1.49 and 1.38 kcal/mol,
respectively, for binding one H2, and Eint/H2 drops down to 0.65 kcal/mol for the
former and 0.67 kcal/mol for the latter, with the uptake of three
H2 molecules. Dihydrogen-binding affinity of neutral salt
systems have been tested by introducing Na+ cation to anion–H2 complexes with n = 10. The Eint decreases significantly in all of the cases; the decline
being more pronounced in systems with smaller anions as the anion–cation
interaction is much higher in those cases (Table 6). The geometric features of these structures
are given in Figure S3, Supporting Information.
These results show that changing a neutral species to anionic form
leads to a massive improvement in its dihydrogen uptake ability.5,6

QTAIM Analysis
The estimated volumes of ClO–, ClO2–, ClO3–, and ClO4– polyatomic anions using
the QTAIM analysis at an isodensity surface value of 0.001 au are
402.97, 458.26, 516.56, and 567.46 au, respectively. The volume (size)
increases with increase in the number of oxygen atoms. Similarly,
in BrOm– series, the
respective volumes are 455.21, 505.96, 562.67, and 620.04 au as m varies from 1 to 4, respectively. The Eint versus volume correlation plot for dihydrogen complexes
of all of the polyatomic anions with n = 3 is represented
in Figure S4, Supporting Information. The Eint decreases with increase in the size of the
anion. However, the size of halogen is not reflected in the H2-binding affinity.

The QTAIM analysis shows bond critical
points (bcps) for all of the O···H and X···H
interactions. Figure 3 represents the QTAIM features of ClO3–(H2)23 and ClO4–(H2)24 complexes as typical examples (see Figures S5 and S6, Supporting Information for
other systems). The red dots indicate bcp for O···H
or Cl···H interactions, whereas the blue dots indicate
bcp for H···H dihydrogen interactions. Because a large
number of bcp are present in the hydrogen-rich complexes, for simplicity,
we consider the average value of the electron density at bcp (ρbcp) for representing the strength of O···H
or Cl···H interactions. Tables 7 and 8 depict ρbcp for a set of ClOm–(H2)n and BrOm–(H2)n, respectively (see Table S5, Supporting
Information, for other systems). The average ρbcp values of ClOm–(H2)n and BrOm–(H2)n are in the range 0.0373–0.0072 and 0.0358–0.0074 au,
respectively. The bond strength is directly proportional to the size
of complex or anion.

The Eint versus ∑ρbcp correlation plots ClOm–(H2)n and BrOm–(H2)n are very much similar, with the correlation coefficients
lying in the range 0.983–0.992 and comparable slope values
(Figures 4 and S7). A linear variation of ∑ρbcp with Eint is observed in the
complexes with lower n values (n < 10), whereas the linear trend is slightly deviated for larger
complexes. The slopes of the graphs decrease with increase in m in both series, indicating that the anion–H2 bond strength is higher in anions with less number of oxygen
atoms or smaller anions. The Laplacian of the electron density (∇2ρbcp) is positive, lying in the range 0.1063–0.0115
au for all XOm–(H2)n. The small ρbcp and positive ∇2ρbcp support that
the anion–H2 interactions are noncovalent in nature.26,27

with O···H, Cl···H, and Br···H
interactions. These interactions are not found until n reaches a value of 10, 7, 3, 5, 9, 7, 3, and 4, respectively, for
ClO–, ClO2–, ClO3–, ClO4–, BrO–, BrO2–, BrO3–, and BrO4– anions.
The ρbcp range of these H···H interactions
is given in Table 9. The strength of these secondary interactions depends on the number
of oxygen atoms and is independent of the halogen present in the anion.
The formation of bcp between H atoms indicates that attractive interactions
develop between dihydrogen molecules adsorbed to the anion. Otherwise,
a repulsive interaction must have resisted the uptake of several dihydrogens
by the anion.6 The complex appears as a
system of molecules well connected by a large network of noncovalent
interconnections. The increasing number of H···H interactions
accounts for almost consistent Eint/H2 with an increase in n (only a minor drop
is observed especially for smaller anions).

Molecular Electrostatic Potential (MESP)
Analysis
The
MESP isosurface plotted for bare anions shows that the negative charge
is concentrated around the oxygen atoms (Figure 5). This explains why the initially added
H2 molecules in the anion–H2 complexes
bind with the oxygens in all of the cases. The anions of ClOm– and BrOm– series show a decrease in the magnitude
of Vmin values (Table 10) with an increase in the size. All of the
ClOm– anions possess
a slightly higher negative Vmin than the
corresponding BrOm– anions.
As there is not much difference in the Vmin values of both series, the Eint and nmax also follow similar trends. The potential
at the nucleus (Vn) of halogen and one
of the oxygen atoms of the polyatomic anion is given in Table 10 (the values are
denoted in atomic units, as the magnitude of Vn is very high compared with Vmin). The magnitude of Vn at oxygen and
halogen decreases with increase in the size of the anion for both
series. Also, Vn at oxygen of any ClOm– anion is very much comparable
with that of corresponding BrOm– anion. The Eint of XOm–(H2)n is directly proportional to the magnitude of Vmin or Vn. As representative examples,
the correlation plots of Eint with Vmin and Vn of all
of the complexes with n = 3 is given in Figure 6a,b, respectively.

A MESP isosurface with the lowest negative value that engulfs
the
whole anion can be always located for an anion/anionic complex.28,29 For instance, such a MESP value for ClO4–(H2)24 is −47.7 kcal/mol (Figure 7). According to Gadre–Pathak
theorem, this value is a directional minimum (Vmin) in MESP and the Vmin of all
of the complexes are given in Table S6,
Supporting Information. A decline in the magnitude of Vmin is noted with an increase in n for
both series of anionic complexes.

the M06L/6-311++G(d,p) level.

Compared with the bare anion, the hydrogen-rich anionic complexes
show significant change in their Vn values
at the halogen and oxygen centers. The total change observed in Vn due to hydrogen uptake (∑ΔVn) is reported in Tables 11 and 12 for a representative
set of ClOm–(H2)n and BrOm–(H2)n,
respectively (see Table S7, Supporting
Information, for rest of the complexes). For identical m and n values, ∑ΔVn of corresponding ClOm–(H2)n are higher
than that of BrOm–(H2)n. For instance, ∑ΔVn of ClO–(H2)10 and BrO–(H2)10 are
84.1 and 76.3 kcal/mol, respectively. The magnitude of ∑ΔVn is directly proportional to n, with both ClOm–(H2)n and BrOm–(H2)n showing similar trend in their variation (Figure S8, Supporting Information). A strong linear correlation is
noted between Eint and ∑ΔVn of ClOm–(H2)n and BrOm–(H2)n, with the correlation coefficient R lying
in the range 0.984–0.993 (Figure 8). The slopes for complexes of ClO–, ClO2–, ClO3–, and ClO4– are 0.516, 0.340, 0.246,
and 0.220, respectively. This indicates that the variation in ∑ΔVn with Eint is maximum
in the case of ClO–, and this anion can be recommended
as the one with the maximum affinity toward dihydrogen. Very similar
trend is observed for BrOm–(H2)n complexes, with BrO– being the anion with the highest affinity toward dihydrogen
(Figure S9, Supporting Information).

The dihydrogen-binding ability of polyatomic anions
varies from
40.0 to 32.7 and 28.5 to 25.2 wt % for ClOm–(H2)nmax and BrOm–(H2)nmax, respectively (Table S8, Supporting Information). The H2 uptake
capacity is maximum (40.0 wt %) for ClO– anion.

Conclusions
The dependence of H2-binding affinity
on the size and
charge density of the anions is studied in the present work by analyzing
the dihydrogen complexes of two sets of polyatomic anionic series.
The analyses of structure, energetics, electron density, and molecular
electrostatic potential have been done to establish the effect of
size and charge density of the interacting polyatomic anion on the
dihydrogen storage ability. Our studies show that the polyatomic anions
with smaller size and less number of atoms are more efficient in H2 binding, as the available charge density is more localized
in such cases. Among all of the anions studied, ClO– emerged as the most efficient for dihydrogen binding. This study
also emphasizes that the ability of the anionic systems for hydrogen
uptake is very high compared with that of their neutral counterparts.
All of the anions show the ability to simultaneously interact with
a large number of H2 molecules, with a steady linear increase
in the total interaction energy. The QTAIM analysis showed that the
adsorbed H2 molecules are not repelled from each other
as the neighboring pairs show stabilizing intermolecular H···H
dihydrogen interactions in the hydrogen-rich complexes. These results
suggest that the hydrogen uptake ability of the materials can be significantly
improved by the incorporation of anionic groups. The challenge is
to design an efficient salt system for hydrogen storage. In other
words, a weakly binding cation–anion combination or a noncoordinating
cation along with the counteranion may serve the purpose. In the present
study, we focused only on the ability of polyatomic anions to bind
with hydrogen, and studies featuring cation–anion combination
is under way.

Computational Methods
In the present
work, all of the calculations have been done using
the M06L/6-311++G(d,p) level of density functional theory.30 This method has been used recently for studying
the interaction of dihydrogen with bare anions as well as anionic
carbon chains and the results showed very low deviations from the
CCSD(T) values.5,6 Also, the M06L method has been
proposed as the best-performing one among the 382 tested functionals
for calculating the geometry and interaction energy of noncovalent
dimers close to the CCSD precision.31 In
this work, the anion–H2 complexes with n = 1 to nmax (maximum number of H2 molecules in the first coordination shell) have been optimized
and the geometries have been established as the energy minima by analyzing
the vibrational frequency at standard temperature (298.15 K) and pressure
(1 atm). The total interaction energy of the complex (Eint) is calculated using the supermolecule approach (energy
of the optimized complex – energy of the reactants optimized
separately) by employing the counterpoise method introduced by Boys
and Bernardi.32 The Eint is given by eq 1, where Ebsse represents the energy correction
for the basis set superposition error (BSSE). 1  For validating the accuracy of the
results
obtained, X–(H2)n complexes with m = 1–5 have been optimized
at CCSD/aug-cc-pVDZ and Eint values have
been calculated at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory.

Bader’s “quantum theory of atoms in molecules”
(QTAIM) analysis has been extensively used for the characterization
of noncovalent interactions.33−40 Our prior studies on H2-coordinated anionic complexes
showed ρbcp for all of the coordinated H2 and the sum of the electron densities at bcp (∑ρbcp) provided a measure of the total noncovalent bonding interactions
in the complex.5,6 Further, the positive sign of
Laplacian of electron density at bcp [∇2(ρbcp)] indicated the noncovalent nature of the anion···H2 bond.41−43

Molecular electrostatic potential (MESP) is
a useful tool for studying
the intermolecular interactions and electron withdrawal/donation in
noncovalent bonding.29,44−49 Previously, we have shown that during the formation of anion···H2 complex, the MESP at the interacting nucleus/nuclei of the
anion undergoes substantial change with respect to the extent of electron
withdrawal by the coordinating H2 molecules.5,6 The MESP for any molecular system at a point r in
space, V(r), is defined in eq 2, where ZA is the charge on the nucleus located at a distance RA, ρ(r′) is the
electron density, and r′ is a dummy integration
variable, and MESP at the nucleus (Vn)
is obtained by dropping out the nuclear contribution due to ZA in eq 2. 2  All of
the optimizations,
energy calculations, and MESP analysis have been done using Gaussian
09 suite of programs,50 and the QTAIM analysis
has been done using AIMAll package.51
