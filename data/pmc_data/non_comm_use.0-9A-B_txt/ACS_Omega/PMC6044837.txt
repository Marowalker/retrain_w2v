In this study, a freshwater microalga, Scenedesmus sp. SB1, was isolated, purified, and identified
by its internal
transcribed spacer region (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2). Media optimization through
the Plackett–Burman Design and response surface methodology
(RSM) showed a maximum exopolysaccharide (EPS) production of 48 mg/L
(1.8-fold higher than that for unoptimized media). Characterization
using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, Fourier transform
infrared, X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analysis reveals
that the EPS is a sulfated pectin polysaccharide with a crystallinity
index of 15.2% and prompt thermal stability. Furthermore, the photoelectrogenic
activity of Scenedesmus sp. SB1 inoculated in BG-11
and RSM-optimized BG-11 (ROBG-11) media was tested by cyclic voltammogram
studies, revealing the potential of the inoculated strain in ROBG-11
toward photosynthetic algal microbial fuel cells over normal BG-11.
To the best of our knowledge, functional group characterization, physical
and thermal property and media optimization for EPS production by
RSM and electrogenic activity studies are reported for the first time
in Scenedesmus sp. SB1.

1 Introduction
Polysaccharides are polymers of carbohydrates that are linked to
each other in a linear or branched fashion with the aid of glycosidic
linkages. The composition of polysaccharides includes proteins, glycoproteins,
or lipids, in addition to carbohydrates.1,2 Depending on
their structure, they vary in their physicochemical properties.3,4 Microorganisms such as bacteria, cyanobacteria, and green unicellular
algae produce exopolysaccharides (EPSs) on the cell outer surface
for adhesion on a substratum, by increasing their resistance against
erosion in a natural habitat.5−8,3 There is a rapidly growing
interest in microbial EPSs from bacteria and fungi on account of their
biodegradability and nontoxicity, which projects them out as ecofriendly
polymers that do not cause secondary pollution.9 Thus, in addition to biological necessity, polysaccharides
also possess numerous industrial and medicinal values in adhesives,
detergents, textiles, cosmetics, wastewater treatment, brewing, and
pharmaceuticals.10 Microalgae have a natural
tendency to secrete polysaccharides into the medium, thus making it
easier to extract them.11 Furthermore,
the growth and cultivation of microalgae are also economical, as they
could be grown with cheap nutrient media or supplements.12 In comparison to that in bacteria and fungi,
the yield of polysaccharides in microalgae is less. However, the composition
of EPS is unique, presenting them as rare polymers with interesting
properties, distinct from other polysaccharides.

The factors
such as growth rate of a microalgae, biochemical content,
type, and yield percentage of EPS13,14 are greatly
influenced by the composition of the culture medium and the culture’s
growth conditions.15−17 Therefore, it is of utmost importance to optimize
the crucial components and conditions that enhance the yield of polysaccharides.
To attain this, an economic and efficient statistical design that
would help in optimizing all of the vital elements and parameters
for growth as well as EPS yield was employed. Furthermore, the inimitability
of microalgal EPS instills interest in exploring a new polysaccharide
that may pose a challenge against the existing, and explored polysaccharides
in use.

In addition to the above, microalgae are also of great
interest
in the field of photosynthetic algal microbial fuel cells (PAMFCs),
which is a potential energy-generating technology that can exploit
sunlight to produce electricity in a carbon neutral fashion.18 The PAMFCs are the cells that are able to generate
power by harvesting electrons from the photochemical and respiratory
actions of algae. The PAMFCs are composed of an anode and a cathode
separated by a polymer electrolyte membrane. Photosynthetic microalgae
at anode produce electrons from the light-driven water splitting reaction
and then the generated electrons are transported through an external
circuit to the cathode where they are consumed by an oxidizing agent.19 The overall performance of PAMFCs depends on
the electron transfer efficiency of the electrodes, emanating from
the intimacy exerted between the electrode and the biofilm.

EPS produced by algae serves as a molecular glue, allowing the
cells to adhere to each other, and assists in the construction of
a healthier biofilm.20 Hence, it is pertinent
to explore and develop new strategies to increase the biomass and
EPS production to obtain proficient PAMFCs. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first report on media optimization for EPS production
in Scenedesmus sp. SB1. A new strain, Scenedesmus sp. SB1, was isolated, identified, and evaluated for its EPS production
and the competency of the isolated Scenedesmus sp.
SB1 under various electrochemical regimes and conditions was analyzed.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Isolation and Molecular
Characterization of
Microalgae
Microalgae that possess sustainability to grow
in local habitats are more likely to be highly competent than those
from other regions. The algae found in some habitat characteristically
form mucilaginous capsules that are presumed to be polysaccharides
in nature.21 However, in some microalgae,
stress factors in their habitat and growth conditions not only contribute
to the production of polysaccharides but also influence the changes
in the structure and functional properties of the produced EPS.22 In the current study, the isolated axenic microalgal
culture was maintained in a BG-11 medium and was identified on the
basis of morphological observations by a light microscope. The surface
topology observation unveiled that the oblong-shaped alga was composed
of 2–4 cells arranged like a stack of coins with the cell diameter
of about 8–12 μm, without any flagella or spines. The
ultrastructure of the cells revealed the presence of a single chloroplast
that occupied a major region of the cell apart from the nucleus, further
confirming the strain to be Scenedesmus sp.23 Molecular characterization of Scenedesmus sp. SB1 by ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 sequences through basic local alignment
search tool (BLAST) analysis revealed 99% homology with 94% query
coverage to Scenedesmus armatus strain
ALG2 (Genbank Accession no. KT159282.1); its phylogenetic analysis
(Figure 1) with the
other closely related microalgae was carried out, the sequences were
submitted to Genbank (Accession no. KJ801562.1), and this unicellular
green algae, Scenedesmus sp. SB1, belongs to the Scenedesmusceae family.

on internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences. The percentage values
at the nodes of the tree are known as bootstrap values, and the distance
between the other related microalgal species is measured by the scale
bar.

2.2 Effect
of Stress Conditions on EPS Production
of Scenedesmus sp. SB1
The production of
EPSs, playing a structural and protective role in microbial biofilms,21 have been reported to be enhanced under stress
conditions.24−26 The information for enhancement of EPS production
in green microalgae under stress conditions is scarce. Among the nutrient
stresses provided to Scenedesmus sp. SB1, the nitrogen
stress did not influence EPS production noticeably (0.037 ± 0.012
mg/mL) when compared to that of the normal BG-11 (0.051 ± 0.019
mg/mL). The acidic stress (pH 6) yielded a 1.6-fold increase in the
EPS production, 0.084 ± 0.037 mg/mL, than that in normal pH 6.8
± 2 (0.051 ± 0.019 mg/mL). However, when the medium was
set at a pH of 8, Scenedesmus sp. SB1 yielded 0.04
± 0.013 mg/mL only. Generally, a pH shift is considered as an
undesirable event that may be fatal to the organism. Therefore, the
organism tends to produce more EPS as a protective strategy.27 But the results of this study infer that the
acidic pH influences more production of EPS than alkaline pH. On the
other hand, when 1% NaCl was added to the medium, Scenedesmus sp. SB1 yielded 0.086 ± 0.04 mg/mL of EPS, 1.67-fold higher
than the yield in normal BG-11. Likewise, 2 and 3% salinity stresses
have also been found to increase EPS production, which is not as significant
as 1% salinity stress. It was also observed that heavy metal (mercuric
chloride, HgCl2) stress provided to Scenedesmus sp. SB1 has not shown noticeable increase in EPS production, which
is in contradiction to the previous reports28 (Supporting Information Table S1).

2.2.1 Analysis of Physical Characteristics and
Chemical Composition by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and Gas
Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS)
The
viscosity of the EPS obtained from Scenedesmus sp.
SB1 was determined using a capillary viscometer and was found to be
0.795 mPa S. The deionized EPS did not contain any protein, as determined
by Lowry’s method. GC–MS analysis of the hydrolyzed
EPS showed the presence of galacturonic acid, ribose, xylose, fructose,
and galactose sugars (Figure 2a). Detection of EPS in the culture filtrate of Scenedesmus sp. SB1 by FTIR analysis against 11 commercially available sugars
(HiMedia) revealed that the structural information of the extracellular
polysaccharide obtained is in concordance with the obtained gas chromatogram.
The noninvasive FTIR method is also able to detect the presence of
functional groups, such as the OH stretch (3445.34 cm–1), CH stretch (2866.82), R–N=C–S (2075.47 cm–1), C=O stretch (1645.76 cm–1), CH2, CH3 (1457.91 cm–1), S=O stretch (1375.69 cm–1), and C–H
stretch (750.29 cm–1) pertaining to pectic acid
or polygalacturonic acid, maltose, mannose, glucose, and ribose sugars
(Figure 2b). The wavenumbers
pertaining to the mentioned functional groups have been compared with
those reported for pectic polysaccharides and could be affirmed to
be the same.29 It is noteworthy to mention
the presence of sulfur group, thus pronouncing it a sulfated pectic
polysaccharide which is not only reported for its high clinical applications
but is exclusively prevalent among brown marine macroalgae. Polygalacturonic
acid has known applications in wine making and brewing too.

The presence of polygalacturonic acid in microalgae-derived
EPS
has already been reported in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.4 However, the EPS profiling of Scenedesmus sp. has not been reported earlier. The results
obtained by FTIR corroborate the results obtained through GC–MS,
thus confirming the sugar profile of the polysachharide (Table 1a). The corresponding
FTIR functional groups and wavenumber ranges are listed in Table 1b.

2.2.2 Powder X-ray Diffraction
(PXRD) Analysis
The phase composition, purity, and crystallinity
(i.e., either
crystalline or amorphous) of the EPS from Scendesmus sp. SB1 were analyzed by the PXRD technique, and the obtained result
is depicted in Figure 3. The sharp thin characteristic diffraction peaks centered at 30.57,
34.74, 34.95, 35.72, 38.43, 40.35, 41.69, 41.98, 47.04, 48.75, 56.72,
and 59.02° with interplanar spacings (d-spacings)
of 2.92, 2.58, 2.56, 2.51, 2.34, 2.23, 2.16, 2.15, 1.92, 1.86, 1.62,
and 1.56 A°, respectively, correspond to the crystalline parts
of EPS. In addition to the aforementioned diffraction peaks, a broad
peak exhibited at 26.03° was ascribed to the amorphous component
of EPS. The amount of crystallinity of EPS was calculated via the
ratio of the sharp thin diffraction peaks to broad peaks, which elucidated
that the extracted EPS is 15.2% crystalline and 84.8% amorphous in
nature. The existing crystalline domain acted as a reinforcing grid
and enhanced the performance of the EPS over a wide temperature range,
as evident from thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).

spectrum of EPS isolated from Scenedesmus sp. SB1.

2.2.3 TGA
The applicability of a polysaccharide
is greatly dependent on its thermal stability and rheological behavior.
TGA is a simple technique that provides the percent weight loss of
the polysaccharide against time.30 TGA
reveals that the weight loss in the EPS from Scenedesmus sp. SB1 is a two-step process in which 80.5% mass loss is detected
in the first phase at 166.869 °C and 63.95% loss is detected
at 298.8 °C in the second phase, which implies the structural
alignment of the compound, which is slightly crystalline and predominantly
amorphous (Figure 4).

2.3 Statistical
Optimization of Media Components
for Enhancing the Production of EPS Using Plackett–Burman Design
(PBD)
To enhance the capability of Scenedesmus sp. SB1 for EPS production, nutrient factors sodium bicarbonate
(NaHCO3), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), and tannery effluent
(TE) were selected for optimizing the growth medium via statistical
modeling using PBD. Chisti in 200712 reported
that owing to the economical constrains involved in the cultivation
of microalgae, exploiting a cheap nutrient source such as industrial
waste is one of the cost-effective strategies in demand. In this study,
combinatorial interactions of crucial factors involved in enhancing
the EPS production in Scenedesmus sp. were analyzed
by PBD. The experiment involves 12 runs with two levels of concentrations
of the foresaid factors. The response was analyzed in terms of EPS
production (mg/mL) and biomass (OD600), and it was depicted
by a Pareto chart (Figure 5). The positive and negative impact of the factors on EPS
production were depicted by orange and blue colors, respectively,
and the reference line at 2.3 (t-value limit) shows
the significant level of the factors. The factors that extend beyond
this line were found to be highly important, as determined by the t-values. It was inferred from the Pareto chart that the
EPS production was statistically influenced by IAA (t-value, 2.73). This was also substantiated by analysis of variance
(ANOVA) of the design (Table S2), according
to which the model was significant for IAA with P-value <0.05 (95% confidence) given by the F-test.
Furthermore, the F-value of 7.53 implies that the
model is significant and there is only a 2.07% chance that the F-value could occur because of noise. In case of biomass
production, the model proved to be insignificant. However, the Pareto
chart implies NaHCO3 as the second crucial factor influencing
biomass production in Scenedesmus sp. SB1 (Figure S1). Studies on the influence of IAA on
the biomass growth in Chlorella sorokiniana have already been reported by Ozioko et al. in 2015,31 where a 10 mg/L IAA has resulted in a 9.5-fold
increase in the cell concentration.

factor with t-value of 2.73 for EPS production.

2.4 Response
Surface Methodology (RSM)-Based EPS
Production in Scenedesmus sp. SB1
Optimization
of media for enhancing the production of EPS was implemented in Scenedesmus sp. SB1. On the basis of the results of PBD,
IAA has been found to be significant for influencing EPS production
and was therefore carried forward for RSM central composite design
(CCD). The supplementation of IAA has been patented for enhancing
the production of value-added products in algae.32 However, there are very scarce reports on the enhancement
of polysaccharide production in freshwater microalgae, supplementing
IAA in the growth media. NaHCO3 has been ranked the second
crucial factor for biomass in PBD, apart from which, there are reports
on marine microalgae that NaHCO3 supplementation influences
biomass production.33 The third factor
in PBD, the tannery effluent, did not exhibit significant effects
either on EPS production or on biomass production. Therefore, an alternating
stress factor, which is also cost-effective, was needed for influencing
EPS in RSM CCD. On the basis of the reports of the preliminary study,
NaNO3– was chosen as the stress factor.
Previous reports state that nitrogen deficiency enhances EPS production
in marine microalgae.34,35 Therefore, NaHCO3,
IAA, and NaNO3– were selected as the
variables for the RSM CCD. Hence, the optimal combination of the variables
of three independent factors was determined through the CCD. Reasonable
agreement of the obtained experimental response values with the software-predicted
values (Table 2) reveals
that the system is in accordance with a linear equation of the critical
factors. The three-dimensional graph reflects the interactions of
NaHCO3, IAA, and NaNO3 for the EPS production
response (Figure 6).

surface plot showing the interaction between
the factors: A, NaHCO3; B, IAA; and C, NaNO3 for the EPS production response.

Among the experimental runs, run 15 of RSM CCD yielded the maximum
EPS of 9.97 mg/L (1.8 folds). The design analysis using ANOVA (F-test) showed that the model chosen is significant for
both the responses, biomass growth (OD600) and EPS production
(mg/mL), with P-values 0.027 and 0.0017, respectively
(Table 3). Furthermore,
the R-squared value (0.8772) denotes that the 87.72%
of variability in the EPS productivity response (mg/mL) is perhaps
elucidated by the model. The significance of the model with the F-value of 7.87 indicates only a 0.17% chance that this F-value could be due to noise. This experiment was further
validated to verify the model and its reproducibility; the highest-yielding
run was validated by cultivation on a large scale in a medium that
was formulated as the RSM-optimized medium (Table 4). The growth and EPS production of Scenedesmus sp. SB1 hit the maximum in the BG-11 medium
without normal levels of NaNO3 (15 g/L), supplemented with
20 mM NaHCO3, 1 μM IAA, and 1.8 g/L NaNO3.

Bicarbonate is one of the crucial
factors influencing a microalga’s
growth and metabolite production. Bicarbonate supplementation has
significantly improved the photosynthetic efficacy and nitrate utilization
from the external media of microalgae.36 In this study, NaHCO3 has shown significance for growth
in the RSM CCD, which corroborates the existing reports as mentioned
above. Apart from this, nitrogen source is one of the essential elements
of a microalgal culture medium, which directly influences the growth
of the organism.37 There are several reports
stating that the source and concentrations of nitrogen can influence
the biochemical composition and growth of microalgae.38,39 In the current study, normal levels of NaNO3 (15 g/L)
were used as the nitrogen source in the BG-11 medium. However, in
the RSM-optimized medium, the concentration of NaNO3 added
was 1.8 g/L, which is deficient for the organism.

This condition
has probably created a stress for the growth of
the organism, which should have contributed to the enhancement in
EPS production.40 On the other hand, the
concentrations of NaNO3, lesser than 1.8 g/L of BG-11 have
resulted in the depletion of the biomass itself. Some strains of algae,
such as Chlorella vulgaris, Nannochloropsis sp., and Neochloris oleoabundans, were previously reported to grow well even under nitrogen-deficient
conditions, utilizing their intracellular nitrogen reserves, such
as pigment protein molecules.41,42 However, intracellular
nitrogen reserve utilization is purely strain-dependent and Scenedesmus sp. SB1 possesses this capability with at least
a minimum source of nitrogen (1.8 g/L) below which the cells die of
nitrogen starvation. Therefore, 1.8 g/L of NaNO3 could
be considered as an optimum concentration that influences the EPS
production, without negatively influencing the growth of the microalgae.
There are very few reports on the symbiotic association of bacteria
(Sulfitobacter) and microalgae, in which the bacterium exchanges IAA
for organosulfur compounds.43,44 This substantiates
the positive impact of IAA in the growth of microalgae.

From
the correlation between the actual and predicted values of
the system and the 1.8-fold increase in EPS production of the strain,
it is evident that the nutrient supplementation and starvation in
the normal growth medium influence the biomass and EPS production
of the strain directly, contributing to the significance of the model.

Studies on optimization have been done for enhancing EPS production
in bacteria and yeast systems, in which a significant 1.6- and 4-fold
increase have been documented, respectively.45,46 However, reports on statistical media optimization for EPS production
are not prevalent. So far, a similar study has been carried out in
green microalgae C. reinhardtii, in
which a 1.6-fold enhancement of EPS production has been documented.4 However, to the best of our knowledge, this is
the first report on statistical modeling of media optimization for
EPS production in Scenedesmus sp. SB1 to yield a
1.8-fold increase, which is the highest among the green algae so far
reported. It is worth mentioning that the research work pertaining
to EPS production in this strain has not been reported elsewhere so
far.

2.5 Electrochemical Activity of Scenedesmus sp. SB1
Electrochemical techniques are crucial tools for
the evaluation and elucidation of the electrode reactions that occur
in PAMFCs. Because the construction of fuel cell systems is very tedious,
the laboratory-scale testing using various electrochemical methods
is highly beneficial and reliable to determine the optimum circumstances.
Henceforth, the electrochemical activity of Scenedesmus sp. SB1 inoculated in BG-11 and RSM-optimized BG-11 (ROBG-11) media
was evaluated. The cyclic voltammetry measurements of Scenedesmus sp. SB1 inoculated in BG-11 and ROBG-11 were achieved at a carbon
cloth (CC) at a scan rate of 50 mV/s (Figure 7). It could be observed that the CC exhibited
only the background current in BG-11 and ROBG-11, exhibiting the electroinactivity
of the media. In contrast, well-defined redox peaks were obtained
in the Scenedesmus sp. SB1-inoculated media over
a potential range of −0.6 to +0.5 V versus Ag/AgCl, endorsing
the redox activity of Scenedesmus sp. SB1. The Scenedesmus sp. SB1-inoculated media exhibited a well-defined
redox couple at 0.22 V and −0.03 V versus Ag/AgCl, which is
attributed to the electroactive polysaccharides located on the cellular
surface or electroactive species present in the electron-rich metabolic
pool (quinone pool).47,48 Although external mediators were
not added into the electrolyte solution or immobilized over the electrode
surface, the studied Scenedesmus sp. SB1 produced
redox peaks, which concludes that the cells are viable for direct
transfer of electrons to the electrode with the aid of the EPS generated
by the cells.

and absence
of Scenedesmus sp. in (a) BG-11 and (b) ROBG-11 at
a scan rate of 50 mV/s. The experiment was carried out in duplicate.

2.6 Photoactivity
of Scenedesmus sp. SB1
To study the photoactivity
of Scenedesmus sp. SB1, cyclic voltammetry measurements
were recorded under the
presence and absence of light (Figure 8). Under illumination, the light-driven electrical
responses of the Scenedesmus sp. SB1 inoculated in
BG-11 and ROBG-11 media were directly compared with the voltammograms
obtained under dark conditions. In comparison with the cyclic voltammetric
responses of Scenedesmus sp. SB1 under dark conditions,
the CC exhibited an increased anodic wave current in the presence
of light, pronouncing the photoactivity of Scenedesmus sp. SB1 (Figure 8a,b). The increase in the anodic peak current during light illumination
might have originated from the break down of intracellular metabolites
and/or splitting of water molecules.49,50 The splitting
of water molecules could generate electrons that are transferred to
the photosynthetic electron transfer chain, resulting in the improved
oxidation current of Scenedesmus sp. SB1 during light
illumination.49

of the CC in the presence of Scenedesmus sp. in (a)
BG-11 and (b) ROBG-11 under dark and light conditions
at a scan rate of 50 mV/s (inset: voltammograms in high magnification).
The experiment was carried out in duplicate.

Furthermore, the kinetics involved in the electrochemical
reaction
was evaluated as a function of the scan rate at the CC in Scenedesmus sp. SB1 under light (Figure 9a,b). As shown in the figure, the anodic
responses ascribed to the photosynthetic water splitting were increased
and positively shifted with an increasing scan rate. In addition,
the square root of scan rates and the anodic peak currents exhibited
good linearity with high correlation coefficients (R) of 0.996 and 0.993 for the Scenedesmus sp. SB1
inoculated in BG-11 and ROBG-11 media, respectively, revealing that
the electrochemical redox reaction occurring at the electrode surface
is a diffusion-controlled process.

presence of Scenedesmus sp. in (a) BG-11 and (b)
ROBG-11 as a function of the scan rate
ranging from 10 to 100 mV/s (inset: calibration plot of current vs
square root of scan rate). The experiment was carried out in duplicate.

2.7 Evaluation
of Photocurrent Production
Evaluation of photocurrent generation
was performed with the aid
of chronoamperometry experiments in the presence and absence of light,
by holding a potential at 0.25 V versus Ag/AgCl (Figure 10). Irrespective of the chosen
medium, Scenedesmus sp. SB1 exhibited a lower photocurrent
under dark conditions. Under the illumination of light, the photocurrent
generation increased, which could be attributed to the progression
of light-driven photosynthetic water splitting. In comparison with
BG-11, ROBG-11 exhibited a continuous, stable, higher current density
in the presence of light, which indicates that Scenedesmus sp. SB1 inoculated in ROBG-11 is highly photoactive. In general,
the EPS production in living organisms provide many diverse benefits
to the cells, including adhesion, protection, and colonization, and
EPS could act as a molecular glue, allowing the formation of well-defined
biofilms. Hence, it could be concluded that the immense secretion
of EPS in ROBG-11 results in the formation of a definite biofilm,
which guaranteed an intact contact between the electroactive proteins
located on the cellular surface and CC, facilitating improved electron
transfer under light illumination. On the basis of the significant
results obtained in the electrochemical analyses, we can assure that
the aforesaid Scenedesmus sp. SB1 inoculated in ROBG-11
is a promising strain for the construction of PAMFCs.

of the CC carried out under dark
and light conditions. The experiment was carried out in duplicate.

3 Conclusions
Media optimization through the PBD and RSM CCD has shown a significant
(1.8-fold) increase in EPS production in Scenedesmus sp. SB1. Physicochemical characterization revealing the presence
of galacturonic acid and thermal stability of up to 298.8 °C
makes it a potential candidate for several applications. Photoelectricity
generation in Scenedesmus sp. SB1 inoculated in ROBG-11
exhibited superior performance than that in normal BG-11, which was
identified through cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry studies.
These results afford a useful framework for the future design and
operation of PAMFCs.

4 Methods
4.1 Sample
Collection, Isolation, and Cultivation
of Microalgae
Microalgal samples were collected from a temporary
freshwater pond at Palkalai Nagar, Madurai District, Tamil Nadu, India
(9.9405° N, 78.0105° E). The samples were isolated by serial
dilution method and inoculated on BG-11 agar medium, pH 6.8 ±
0.2. The culture was incubated at 25 °C for 14 days and was maintained
under constant illumination of 1500 lx of alternate photoperiod (light–dark,
12:12 h).51 The axenic culture was obtained
(observed by a light microscope; Labomed, Germany) and was transferred
into the BG-11 medium for further biomass development.

4.2 DNA Extraction and Polymerase Chain Reaction
(PCR)
Genomic DNA was extracted from the exponential growth
culture of isolate SB1 using the standard protocol.52 Genomic DNA (100 ng) was used as the template for PCR using
ITS primers (5′-ACCTAGAGGAAGGAGAAGTCGTAA-3′, 5′-TTCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3′)
to amplify the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region.53 PCR (Nexus Gradient Mastercycle; Eppendorf, Germany) was performed
with the following reaction conditions, initial denaturation at 94
°C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C
for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, extension at 72 °C
for 30 s, and final extension at 72 °C for 10+ min. PCR products
were electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose gel and were purified using the
GenElute kit (Sigma-Aldrich) using the protocol of the manufacturer.
Further PCR products were sequenced by Sanger’s dideoxy method,
and BLAST analysis was performed (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) with the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region of isolate SB1 as query. A phylogenetic
tree was constructed by molecular evolutionary genetics analysis version
6.0 software based on the neighbor-joining tree method of phylogeny
test with 1000 bootstrap replications using ribosomal sequences to
determine the taxonomic level with the other closely related microalgae,
and the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 sequences were submitted to GenBank (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).

4.3 Cultivation of Microalgae under Stress Conditions
Nutrient stress condition by nitrogen starvation, excluding nitrogen
source NaNO3, in the normal BG-11 medium was imposed. Osmotic
stress with the addition of 1, 2, and 3% NaCl was also created. Acidic
and alkaline stresses were imposed by altering the pH of normal BG-11
from 7 to 6 and to 8, respectively. Heavy metal stress was created
by addition of 1, 5, and 10 μg of mercuric chloride (HgCl2) to normal BG-11. Scenedesmus sp. SB1 (14
± 0.06 mg/50 mL DW) was taken as the initial inoculum in 100
mL Erlenmeyer’s flask. Normal BG-11 was used as the control.
All of the studies were performed in duplicate, and the results are
expressed as mean ± standard deviation.

4.4 Biomass
and EPS Productivity of Scenedesmus sp. SB1
The cell density was continuously monitored for
biomass and EPS production, which was read by measuring the absorbance
at 600 nm, and the log phase microalgae were harvested at 20th day.
EPS was extracted from microalgae by heating the cells in a water
bath at 45 °C for 20 min, followed by centrifugation at 8000
rpm for 25 min at room temperature. The supernatant was collected,
and an aliquot was stored for total sugar analysis. The remaining
supernatant was added with 3 times its volume of acetone54 and stored at −20 °C for 24 h. After
24 h, the acetone–supernatant mixture was spun down at 4 °C
for 20 min. The polysaccharides precipitated along the sides of the
tube were collected and air-dried to measure the yield of EPS gravimetrically.
All of the experiments were performed in triplicate, and the results
were expressed as mean ± standard deviation.

4.5 Total Sugar Estimation
Total sugars
in the supernatant were estimated using the phenol sulfuric acid method.55 The supernatants collected were then ultrafiltered
using an ultrafiltration membrane (10 000 molecular weight
cut-off; Merck) for the removal of ions present in the precipitate.
The partially purified polysaccharide was then estimated for its total
sugar content by the conventional phenol sulfuric acid assay, using d-glucose as the standard.

4.6 Characterization
of Physical Properties
The intrinsic viscosity was determined
with a capillary viscometer
(Redwood viscometer No. 1; Pune, India). The time required for the
solution flow was determined and expressed in millipascals. The dried
EPS was dissolved in distilled water to a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL
by heating at 45 °C and stirring for 6 h at room temperature
prior to testing for viscosity. Water was used as the reference. All
viscosity measurements were carried out in triplicate using freshly
prepared solutions. Viscosity was estimated by the following formula 1  where t1 is the
time taken by the EPS to flow in the viscometer, d1 is the density of the EPS solution, t2 is the time taken by the solvent to flow in the viscometer,
and d2 is the density of the solvent.

4.7 Analysis of Chemical Composition by FTIR and
GC–MS
The transmittance FTIR spectrum within the 4000–400
cm–1 wavenumber range was recorded using KBr pellets
in a Bruker advanced FTIR analyzer (Bruker, Germany). The spectra
obtained at room temperature56 were smoothed
and baseline-adjusted. The obtained spectra of the sample and monosugar
standards (HiMedia) were exported to Origin 6.0 software for overlay
of the standards upon the sample. The overlapped band positions were
obtained by the second derivative algorithm. The functional groups
were interpreted using IR PAL (8.0) software.

The chemical composition
of the extracted EPS was analyzed by hydrolyzing the sample with 4
N trifluoroacetic acid for 6 h at 80 °C. The hydrolysate was
then derivatized by reduction with NaBH4 and acetylation
with pyridine and acetic anhydride to its corresponding alditol acetates.57 The derivatized EPS samples were analyzed by
GC (Agilent Technologies 6890, N series), and the m/z values were obtained using an electron impact
ionization-mass spectrometer (JEOL GC MATE-II; JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan)
equipped with a HP-5 MS column, photon multipler tube detector, and
quadrupole double-focusing mass analyzer. Standard monosaccharides
were also derivatized and analyzed by the same procedure. Each peak
was also compared with the National Institute for Standards and Technology
(NIST) database at the Sophisticated Analytical Instrument Facility,
Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India
(http://www.saif.iitm.ac.in)

4.8 PXRD Analysis
PXRD spectroscopy was
performed with BRUKER eco D8 advanced, Germany, with radiation generated
at 40 kV and 20 mA with a LynxEye detector to study the nature of
EPSs using a slow scan in 10–100Θ, and the spectrum was
recorded. The irradiated length and specimen length were 10 mm with
receiving slit size of 0.2 mm at a 255 mm goniometer radius. The distance
between the focus and divergence slit was 100 mm. The dried EPS sample
was mounted on a quartz substrate, and the intensity peaks of diffracted
X-rays were continuously recorded with a scan step time of 64 s at
25 °C while d-spacings appropriate to diffracted
X-rays at that value of Θ were calculated by Bragg’s
law (eq 2). 2  where Θ is half of the scattering angle
measured from the incident beam.

The crystallinity index (CIxrd) was calculated from the area under crystalline peaks normalized
with the corresponding total scattering area that is, the ratio of
the areas of the peaks of crystalline phases to the sum of the areas
of crystalline peaks and the amorphous profile (eq 3)58 3  

4.9 TGA
TGA of EPS
was carried out on
a thermal analyzer, model SDT Q600. The thermogram was obtained in
the range of 30–300 °C under nitrogen atmosphere at a
rise of 1 °C/min. The analysis was performed by gradually increasing
the temperature, plotting the weight (percentage) against time in
minutes using thermal advantage software.

4.10 Media
Optimization Using the PBD
The PBD was employed to determine
the most significant media components
for EPS production using the software Design Expert version 9.0. The
following three crucial components were selected: NaHCO3, IAA, and the TE. Each variable was represented as high and low
levels, as described by the PBD, and a total of 12 experimental runs
were generated. All of the experiments were carried out in duplicate,
and the mean value of EPS was taken as response 1 (Y1) and optical cell density corresponding to the biomass
production was taken as response 2 (Y2). The process of optimization was defined in a first-order polynomial
model and represented as follows 4  where Y is the response,
β is the model intercept, βi is the linear coefficient, and Xi is the level of independent variables. On the basis of the
significant increase in the response, the crucial variables were further
selected for the RSM CCD based on the Pareto chart depiction.

4.11 RSM–Central Composite Rotatory Design-Based
Media Optimization
A statistical experimental design using
RSM is long-established technique employed by researchers for increasing
the production of metabolites. A five-level two-factor CCD was employed
in optimizing a suitable medium with NaHCO3 (A), IAA (B),
and nitrogen deficiency (NaNO3–) (C)
as the independent variables. Design Expert software version 9.0 was
used to launch the optimized medium. NaHCO3 and IAA were
supplemented to the normal BG-11 medium, whereas NaNO3,
which is one of the media components itself, was the starvation factor.
The RSM CCD enclosed a total of 20 experimental runs at five coded
levels, viz., −α, −1, 0, +1, + α, corresponding
to NaHCO3 (3.18, 10, 20, 30, and 36.82 mM), IAA (0.159
M, 0.5 μM, 1 μM, 1.5 μM, and 1.84 μM), and
NaNO3 (0.159, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 1.84 g/L), respectively.
The 20 experimental runs of the design had six center value replications.
Responses Y1 and Y2 were EPS production (mg/mL) and biomass (OD600), respectively. The results were statistically analyzed by a quadratic
equation as given below 5  where Y is the response,
β0 is the intercept term, βi is the linear effect, βii is the squared effect, βij is
the interaction effect, Xi and Xj are the factors
independent variables, and ε is the error. The experiment was
carried out in triplicate, and the results are expressed in terms
of mean ± standard error.

4.12 Electrochemical
Characterization
The cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry
studies were performed
using a CHI-650D analytical system, connected with a single-compartment
cell comprising a three-electrode configuration with a CC (1 ×
1 cm2) as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl (1 M KCl) as the
reference electrode, and a platinum wire as the counter electrode. Scenedesmus sp. SB1, which was grown in the BG-11 medium
and the ROBG-11 medium at 25 °C under the light–dark regime
of 12:12 h, was used as the electrolyte. Simultaneously, the control
experiments (i.e., BG-11 or ROBG-11 medium only) were also performed.
The effect of light illumination on the electrochemical activity of Scenedesmus sp. SB1 was examined by placing the electrochemical
cell under irradiation of 30 μmol photons/m2 s during
the experiment. For the dark measurement, the system was wrapped with
a black cloth and the experiment was carried out in the light-off
mode and after the dark adaptation for 20 min. All the experimental
measurements were carried out at room temperature, 27 ± 1 °C.
