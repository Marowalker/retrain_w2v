k(E) can be calculated either
from the Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel–Marcus theory
or by inverting macroscopic rate constants k(T). Here, we elaborate the inverse Laplace transform approach
for k(E) reconstruction by examining
the impact of k(T) data fitting
accuracy. For this approach, any inaccuracy in the reconstructed k(E) results from inaccurate/incomplete k(T) description. Therefore, we demonstrate
how an improved mathematical description of k(T) data leads to accurate k(E) data. Refitting inaccurate/incomplete k(T), hence, allows for recapturing k(T) information that yields more accurate k(E) reconstructions. The present work suggests that
accurate representation of experimental and theoretical k(T) data in a broad temperature range could be used
to obtain k(T,p). Thus, purely temperature-dependent kinetic models could be converted
into fully temperature- and pressure-dependent kinetic models.

Introduction
Pressure-dependent
reactions are ubiquitous parts in gas-phase
chemical processes,1 and it is essential
to describe the rate constants k(T,p) for understanding combustion,2−6 atmospheric chemistry,7,8 and chemical
vapor deposition.9,10 Apart from direct experimental
measurements,11k(T,p) is obtained from microscopic balancing,
employing the master equation (ME) approach,1,12 using
microcanonical rate constant k(E) as an indispensable ingredient.

The prediction of k(E) has been
a central aspect in chemical kinetic research for almost a century,
starting with the landmark work on the Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel–Marcus
(RRKM) theory.13−15 Variants of this theory were used to estimate pressure
dependence16,17 and laid the foundation for automated k(T,p) prediction schemes18−22 used in, e.g., reaction mechanism generator software of Green and
co-workers.23 The present research focuses
on properly including dynamic effects, such as variational effects,
multidimensional tunneling, and multistructural coupled anharmonicity.24 Such effects are actively accounted for in state-of-the-art
kinetics prediction software, such as RPMDrate25 and POLYRATE.26 A recent and
promising approach for obtaining reliable k(E) is the so-called system-specific Quantum RRK (SS-QRRK)
theory proposed by Bao et al.27

Although
state-of-the-art k(E) predictions
via the SS-QRRK theory and similar approaches allow
to accurately estimate k(E) even
for large molecules, the less followed inverse Laplace transform (ILT)
approach28 can serve as an alternative
without need of explicit knowledge of the molecular properties. According
to the general perception, however, these advantages are derogated
by the low quality of k(E) data
obtained with the ILT approach. Nonetheless, the combination of ILT
and ME simulations29 is often used to extend
the experimentally measured rate constants to arbitrary temperature
and pressure ranges.30,31 Moreover, ILT has been applied
to theoretical high-pressure rate constant data to obtain k(E) for use in ME simulations.31−34

As will be shown here, the bad repute of the ILT approach
for k(E) reconstruction stems from
the method’s
high sensitivity to the input data quality, resulting in practically
useless microcanonical kinetic data when feeding in inaccurate or
incomplete canonical kinetic data. More precisely, the pitfall of
the ILT approach lies in the k(T) input data representation, which is typically based on the regular
or modified Arrhenius forms in the aforementioned studies, which will
be shown to be deficient for proper k(E) reconstruction. Besides the well-established Arrhenius form, several
functional forms were proposed for modeling macroscopic kinetic data,
e.g., by Truhlar and co-workers,35,36 which will
be shown to be promising input data for k(E) reconstruction via ILT. In addition, novel modifications
of the Arrhenius equation will be proposed and tested.

To redeem
the reputation of k(E) reconstruction
via ILT, we provide a careful assessment of the
input data quality, it’s impact on the quality of k(E) reconstruction, and means for improving the
input data quality. Finally, we show that feeding thoroughly reconstructed k(E) into the ME approach provides accurate k(T,p) predictions. Ultimately,
the present work aims at convincing researchers to revisit well-established
automated k(T,p) prediction schemes and reassess the functional form for k(T) input data representation.

Results
and Discussion
Before we move to the assessment of the input
data quality for
the ILT, a brief introduction to the ILT method for k(E) computation will be considered together with
tests of chemical reactions and mathematical models for approximation
of the kinetic input data. We start with the mathematical expression
for k(E) for unimolecular reactions  In this expression, the ILT, denoted by , needs to be applied to a reactant’s
partition function, Q(T), and to
the product of Q(T) with the high-pressure
limit rate constant, k∞(T). The advantage of the ILT concerning RRKM theory is that
no prior information on the transition state is required. This information
is implicitly available from k∞(T). Therefore, providing an accurate and complete
description of k∞(T) is highly relevant not only within the experimental range of temperatures
but also outside this range, i.e., in the limits T → 0 and T → ∞. For simplicity,
we specifically focus on various mathematical descriptions of the
raw k∞(T) data
and will not discuss different approximations for Q(T) but confine to the rigid-rotor harmonic-oscillator
(RRHO) approximation. The reference k(E) data, k(T,p),
and k∞(T) have
been calculated for each reaction with RRKM theory, conducting multiple
well and multiple channel ME simulations employing MESS software37 (see Computational Methods). Note, all results presented here are computed in the nonvariational
single-structural harmonic-oscillator-based RRKM approximation to
prove the concept and advocate the ILTs. The benchmarking of ILT using
either experimental results or the state-of-the-art SS-QRRK and variational
transition state theories will be conducted in a future work.

As the next step, we select a set of 10 reactions simulated previously
in our group;38 see Table 1. For simplicity, we consider one possible
reaction path per reactant only. The reactions considered in the test
set cover a broad range of adiabatic activation energies from 26 to
167 kJ mol–1. Among these 10 reactions, 4 reactions
are radical isomerization reactions and 6 reactions are radical decomposition
reactions. On the other hand, seven reactions (1–6 and 10) are
H-atom transfer/abstraction reactions, where tunneling plays an important
role, which is not so important for 7–9. Thus, these two test sets allow to verify the ILT
performance not only for the different reaction types but also to
check whether the ILT can account for possible tunneling from provided k∞(T).

Before employing the ILT, it is
necessary to represent k∞(T) data in a condensed
format by applying various models. Ten models were considered to fit k∞(T) data, with a maximum
of four adjustable parameters (see Table 2). The simplest model for representing k∞(T) is the Arrhenius
equation (eq 11) with
two parameters A and B. These parameters
can be quickly obtained by applying linear regression for ln[k∞(T)] on the basis of
one descriptor, the inverse temperature, T–1. The Arrhenius equation could be further modified by including ln(T) or/and T descriptors and applying multilinear
regression. These changes lead to the modified Arrhenius (eq 12), the reduced van’t
Hoff (eq 13), and the
van’t Hoff (eq 14) equations.43 Because of their simplicity,
linear and multilinear regressions were and will be a standard practice
for the approximation of ln[k∞(T)] data and their representation in tables and databases.44

using the inverse

and parameters can be found in the Supporting Information (see Table S2 and below).

b Normalized average root mean squared
deviation between the reference and approximated ln[k∞(T)]. The modified Arrhenius
equation was selected as the reference since this format is the frequently
used format to represent kinetic data.

c Note, an absolute value of the parameter C was used under natural logarithm to prevent the failure
during ILT.

The convenience
and simplicity of k∞(T) data representation via one of the first four
equations in Table 2 has its price, providing results that deviate noticeably from the
reference after ILT (see Figure 1A,B). Therefore, we consider modifications of the Arrhenius
equation, which are not linear in the parameters (see eqs 15–18), expecting that these models could perform better. The application
of nonlinear regression techniques is not as challenging as it was
several decades ago but nowadays are readily available in most popular
data processing packages. The first investigated modification of the
Arrhenius equation is the stretching of the exponential function exp(−x) ≈ exp(−xs) with s close to unity (eq 15). This modification is referred
to as the stretched Arrhenius or s-Arrhenius equation. The second
modification is the Aquilanti–Mundim deformed Arrhenius equations
or d-Arrhenius45 (eq 16). This modification represents the exponent
in the Arrhenius equation as the Euler limit exp(−x) ≈ (1 – d·x)1/d with a finite value of d close to zero. These
nonlinear modifications of the Arrhenius equation coincide with it
at s = 1 or, respectively, in the limit d → 0. The s- and d-Arrhenius equations allow to account for
the deviations from the Arrhenius equation that are related to tunneling
effects and the temperature dependence of the prefactor. An alternative
functional form that could also account for tunneling is eq 17. This equation is named
as the exponentially modified Arrhenius or e-Arrhenius equation. The
deformed exponentially modified Arrhenius (d-e-Arrhenius) equation
was considered (eq 18). This equation includes the features of d- and e-Arrhenius equations
and contains four adjustable parameters. To the best of our knowledge, eqs 15, 17, and 18 have not been considered before for
raw ln[k∞(T)]
data approximation and are proposed here for the first time in this
context. Finally, we included two physically motivated nonlinear four-parameter
equations for fitting ln[k∞(T)] for exothermic (eq 19) and endothermic (eq 20) reactions suggested by Truhlar and co-workers.46,47 Note, the functional form of eqs 17–20 provides a nonzero
value of k∞(T)
at T → 0 K contrary to other equations considered
here.

Figure 1 Reconstructed k(E) obtained from k∞(T) for 1 described via linear (A) and nonlinear (C) fitting functions
and corresponding detailed views (B, D). The vertical black dashed
lines correspond to the adiabatic activation energy. Results for 2–10 are presented in
the Supporting Information in Figures S1–S9.

Now, to assess the input data
quality, we consider the average
of the root mean square deviations (RMSDs) normalized to the RMSD
of the modified Arrhenius equation listed in the last column in Table 2. The normalization
reference is chosen to be the modified Arrhenius equation since this
equation is the most popular format for kinetic data representation.
The complete tables with raw and normalized RMSDs for each reaction
are given in the Supporting Information (see Tables S3 and S4). The RMSD of the modified Arrhenius and reduced
van’t Hoff equations is one-third and half of the RMSD of the
Arrhenius equation once the ln(T) or T are added as descriptors. The inclusion of both descriptors reduces
the RMSD up to 7 times. All considered nonlinear models with three
parameters (eqs 15–17) have shown much lower RMSDs than the modified
Arrhenius equation and compete with results obtained from the best
linear model, even though having one parameter less than the van’t
Hoff equation. Finally, the d-e-Arrhenius, exothermic, and endothermic
equations with four parameters provide the lowest deviation from ln[k∞(T)] data, which is
up to 4 times less than that of the van’t Hoff equation, although
it is not surprising that having more parameters for fitting also
reduces the RMSD. As one can see from the Table 2, the most popular format of kinetic data
representation (the modified Arrhenius equation) is not the best one.
The reason for this deficiency is a linear dependence of the activation
energy in the whole temperature range. The eqs 15–20 show a better
performance to correct such deficiency, pointing out a possible solution
for a new format of kinetic data representation. In the following
discussion on k(E) reconstruction
via ILT, we show that considered nonlinear functional forms significantly
improve the quality of reconstructed k(E).

Next, we consider the results of the ILTs of the canonical
data
represented by eqs 11–20 for k∞(T), using the RRHO approximation for Q(T), as mentioned before. Since the conclusions
remain the same for all considered reactions, we present the results
of only the 1 (for the results for 2–10, see the Supporting Information). Among various methods available for
ILT, we employed the second-order steepest descent algorithm.48−51 In this method, the knowledge of the derivatives of ln[Q(T) exp(E/kBT)] and ln[k∞(T)Q(T) exp(E/kBT)] functions
up to fourth order is required with respect to (kBT)−1. The computation
of the derivatives was done applying symbolic derivatives using MATLAB.52

The reconstructed k(E) is presented
in Figure 1 in a logarithmic
scale versus energy. The striking difference between the ILT of the
linear (A and B) and nonlinear models (C and D) is immediately noticed.
Arrhenius, modified Arrhenius, and reduced van’t Hoff equations
provide systematic underestimation below the activation barrier. A
breakdown of the numerical procedure above the activation energy barrier
for the van’t Hoff equation appears in all cases (1–10) due to nonphysical asymptotic
behavior at high temperatures (see Figures S10–S19 in the Supporting Information).

In contrast to the linear
models, the k(E) reconstructed from
nonlinear models are in better agreement
with the reference RRKM data. First, a significantly improved description
of k(E) is achieved below the adiabatic
activation energy. Second, all nonlinear equations have proved stable
when applying the numerical inversion procedure except the exothermic
equation. For this equation (eq 19), the C parameter was enforced to
be positive under the natural logarithm to achieve numerical stability.
Finally, a systematic decrease of the RMSD for ln[k(E)] was found in the s-, d-, e-, d-e-Arrhenius,
exothermic, and endothermic equations (see the Supporting Information, Table S5). On the basis of this, it appears that
a decrease in the raw k∞(T) data fitting RMSD improves the reconstructed k(E) (see Figure 2). Switching from the s-Arrhenius equation
to the d-Arrhenius equation reduces the RMSD for ln[k(E)] up to 7 orders of magnitude. Subsequently,
employing the e-Arrhenius and d-e-Arrhenius equations further decreases
RMSD for ln[k(E)] for 1 order, providing
more accurate reconstruction of the RRKM k(E) data for reactions considered here. A further decrease
of RMSD can be achieved by applying exothermic and endothermic fitting
formulas but only for 5 out of 10 reactions. However, even this improvement
does not lead to better k(T,p) after ME simulations from computed k(E) (see below).

Figure 2 RMSDs for ln[k(E)] vs RMSDs for
ln[k∞(T)] for
nonlinear models. No linear models were included in the figure since
they largely underestimate microcanonical rate constants.

The next important point is the temperature interval
and the number
of points for the initial model fitting. So far, all results were
obtained from data in the temperature range 300–2000 K with
10 K steps, i.e., 171 equidistant data points were used for the fitting.
In many cases, it might be problematic to get sufficient data points,
especially in the low-temperature region. Thus, we consider scenarios
for 1 where the data points are sparse (50 K
step) and cover the whole region 300–2000 K, low-temperature
region 300–700 K, intermediate region 700–1200 K, and
high-temperature region 1200–2000 K. The sparsity of the initial
data does not influence the final k(E) (see Figure S20 in the Supporting Information).
However, narrow data ranges decrease the completeness of k(E) reconstruction. Moving from low- to high-temperature
ranges, the information on k(E)
at low E systematically disappears. Also, at the
low-temperature region underestimation of the reference k(E) can be noticed. Thus, the completeness of k(E) reconstruction highly depends on the
input k∞(T) and
ideally requires the temperature range as large as possible.

As we have shown above, the application of nonlinear models for
fitting raw k∞(T) data brings a dramatic improvement of k(E) obtained with the ILT. Thus, the application of such
nonlinear models is highly advisable for fitting the raw k∞(T) data. The majority of k∞(T) data available
in the literature, however, has been originally fitted via the modified
Arrhenius equation and going back to the raw k∞(T) data is often not easy, if possible
at all. Therefore, it is desirable to avoid using the raw k∞(T) data and instead
to refit the rate constants available in the modified Arrhenius format
using nonlinear models. This makes out of initially loose input data
a much better source for the ILT approach. To this end, we consider
the nonlinear models (eqs 15–20) for refitting [k∞(T)] data provided in the modified
Arrhenius equation format. The refitted nonlinear models were then
used as input for ILT to obtain k(E). The results for 1 are presented in Figure 3. As one can see,
for s-, d-, and e-Arrhenius equations, the results of the refitting
of the modified Arrhenius equation match the results obtained from
the original data both at low- and high-energy regions, whereas d-e-Arrhenius
together with exo- and endothermic equations performs poorly compared
with the original results. This poor performance appears to be due
to the bad performance of the modified Arrhenius equation at low temperatures.
The actual behavior at such conditions could not be recaptured once
it is lost during the initial fitting. Despite this small drawback,
refitting the modified Arrhenius equation by nonlinear models and
the subsequent inversion of them provides much better k(E) recovery than direct inversion of the modified
Arrhenius equation. This emphasizes that the newly proposed functional
forms not only allow for better initial fitting of k∞(T) but are physically more meaningful
when being used to reconstruct k(E) via ILT.

refitted modified Arrhenius equation. A vertical dashed line is the
reaction energy barrier. The left side (A) contains the comparison
of the s- and d-Arrhenius equations, whereas the right-hand side (B)
contains the comparison of the e- and d-e-Arrhenius equations.

Finally, we considered the results
of the computation of k(T,p) from reconstructed k(E) employing ME simulations. These k(T,p) were obtained from
the molecular data employing RRKM/ME simulations and from the reactant’s Q(T) and k(E) employing ILT/ME simulations. The resulting k(T,p) at various temperatures for 1 is presented in Figure 4 (results for 2–10 are given in the Supporting Information, Figures S21–S29). The linear models presented
by eqs 11–13 (see Figure S30 in the
Supporting Information) indicate that the smallest deviation between
ILT/ME and RRKM/ME can be achieved at 2000 K. This shows once again
that use of eqs 15–20 for ILT/ME simulations is highly promising for
predicting the pressure-dependent reactions.

Figure 4 k(T,p) computed
from reference RRKM/ME (points) and ILT/ME simulations (solid lines)
for the 1. Black, red, blue, green, and orange
points and lines correspond to simulations at 300, 400, 500, 900,
and 2000 K, respectively. Top left (A), top right (B), middle left
(C), middle right (D), bottom left (E), and bottom right (F) parts
of the figure represent the results for the s-, d-, e-, d-e-Arrhenius,
exothermic, and endothermic equations as the input data for ILT/ME
simulations, respectively. Results for 2–10 are presented in the Supporting Information in Figures S21–S29.

To provide quantitative results for the performance of ILT/ME
approach,
we computed normalized average RMSDs between ILT/ME and RRKM/ME results
for different reaction types (see Table 3; for unscaled results, see Tables S6–S10 in the Supporting Information). Since
in most of the cases the best agreement between ILT/ME and RRKM/ME
results was found for the d-e-Arrhenius equation at 2000 K, we normalized
all RMSD at other temperatures and methods to this value within similar
reaction types. Going from 2000 to 300 K, the deviation between RRKM/ME
and ILT/ME results increases for all considered reaction types. The
d-e-Arrhenius equation performs the best for the isomerization reactions
with the proton transfer (1, 2, 5, and 6) followed
by exo- and endothermic equations and e-, d-, and s-Arrhenius equations.
For the decomposition reactions with the proton abstraction (3, 4, and 10), the best performance showed e- and d-e-Arrhenius equations, followed
by d-, s-Arrhenius, exothermic, and endothermic equations. Finally,
the decomposition reactions without proton abstraction (7–9) could be described more accurately
by exothermic and endothermic equations at 2000 K, whereas at lower
temperatures, e-Arrhenius provides much better results. Our results
indicate that it is essential to provide a very accurate, physically
motivated fitting formula for the initial k∞(T) input data. The fitting formula should consider
both quantum tunneling and the nonlinear temperature dependence of
the activation energy at low temperatures. More interestingly, the
models with a finite limit at T → ∞,
i.e., e- and d-e-Arrhenius equations, provide the best performance
compared with the physically motivated exo- and endothermic equations.
Thus, we can conclude that the finite limit at T →
∞ is an additional condition for providing better physically
motivated fitting formula.

Conclusions
The present work provides
a sophisticated comparison and testing
of different k(T) representations
as input to the ILT approach for k(E) reconstruction. This comparison reveals that the ILT approach is
highly sensitive to the k(T) input
data quality, which directly affects the k(T,p) predictions based on reconstructed k(E) data. It is found to be essential
to provide a very accurate, physically motivated fitting formula for
fitting the experimental or theoretical k(T) input data. This formula should consider both quantum
tunneling and the nonlinear temperature dependence of the activation
energy in the low-temperature region (T < 500
K), as well as the finite limit for T → ∞.

The endothermic and exothermic equations are designed to reproduce
the correct low-temperature behavior, whereas the presently proposed
e- and d-e-Arrhenius equations always have a finite limit for T → ∞. Using the e- and d-e-Arrhenius equations
largely improves the quality of k(T) representation and makes ILT a robust alternative to RRKM theory
for k(E) computation. With these
findings, we want to encourage researchers to revisit well-established k(T,p) prediction schemes
and to consider the presently proposed k(T) representations as the input for k(E) reconstruction via ILT.

The e- and d-e-Arrhenius
equations can further be used to regain
microcanonical information from k(T) literature data provided in the modified Arrhenius form. Although k(T,p) prediction via
ILT/ME with input in the modified Arrhenius form would be practically
useless, using the e- or d-e-Arrhenius equations to refit the aforementioned
input data provides reliable k(T,p). Therefore, the present work is a first step
toward estimating completely pressure-dependent chemical kinetic models
from available high-pressure literature data.

Computational Methods
Temperature- and pressure-dependent rate constants for the unimolecular
reactions are calculated via the master equation (ME) using MESS software
package version 2016.3.23.37 Also, the
microcanonical rate constants are calculated employing the nonvariational
single-structural harmonic-oscillator-based RRKM approximation in
MESS software package. Three and two rotational degrees of freedom
were included in computing the Qs for nonlinear and
linear molecules, respectively. Because of the classical treatment
of the rotational degrees of freedom, 1 − D k(E) in the master equation calculation was used
without imposing J conservation. Tunneling is considered
via one-dimensional Eckart potentials obtained from the well depths
and imaginary frequencies of the transition states. The energy transfer
via collisions is modeled via the weak collider bath gas nitrogen
using ⟨ΔEdown⟩ = 200
cm–1 (T/300)0.85; the
Lennard-Jones collision frequency was taken from Döntgen et.
al.53 The temperature range considered
in these studies was from 300 to 2000 K with a 10 K increment, whereas
the pressure was considered from 10–3 to 108 bar with a 0.2 increment in the common logarithmic scale.

The ILT/ME simulations were conducted by providing the number of
states for the reactants and transition states in separate files computed
from 1 to 40 000 cm–1 with 1 cm–1 steps. The MESS.2016.3.23 version of code needs to be modified at
line 5045 in the file model.cc from static const double rotd_ntol = 1. to static const double rotd_ntol
= 1.e-300 to enable the direct reading of the number of
states obtained from the ILT/ME simulations. Since the computation
was time consuming due to the missing libraries, we multiply the number
of states of reactant and transition state to 1050. All
values less than 1.01 after scaling were enforced to be 1.01. These
changes of the input data do not change the final results.

The
reading of the files with the number of states was activated
with the “Core Rotd” keyword. The number of states for
the reactant was computed by inverting the reactant’s partition
function divided by β = 1/(kBT). The number of states for the transition state was computed
by inverting k(β)·Q(β)
and multiplying with the Planck constant expressed in the appropriate
units, i.e., in s·cm–1.

The inverse Laplace
transform is given by the Bromwich integral 21  where γ is a vertical contour in the
complex plane chosen so that all singularities of F(β) are to the left of it. β and E are
the inverse temperature and energy expressed in cm and cm–1, respectively. To evaluate this integral, the integrand is assumed
to have a maximum at a position β*. Using the auxiliary function
ϕ(β) = ln[F(β) eEβ], the maximizer β* is computed as a
solution of ϕ′(β) = 0. Finally, the maximizer β*
for a fixed E is used to compute a continuous approximation
of the original function f(E) 22  Q(β) and k(β)·Q(β) functions were used to
get ρ(E) and ρ(E)·k(E) functions, respectively. From these
functions, the target k(E) was computed.
