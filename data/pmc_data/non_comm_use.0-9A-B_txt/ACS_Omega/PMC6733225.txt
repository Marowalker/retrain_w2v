The recent successful
findings of H3S and LaH10 compressed above 150
GPa with a record high Tc (above 200 K)
have shifted the focus on hydrogen-rich materials
for high superconductivity at high pressure. Moreover, some studies
also report that transition-metal ternary hydrides could be synthesized
at a relatively low pressure (∼10 GPa). Therefore, it is highly
desirable to investigate the crystal structures of ternary hydrides
compounds at high pressure since they have been long considered as
promising superconductors and hydrogen-storage materials with a high Tc, and can be possibly synthesized at low pressure
as well. In this work, combining state-of-the-art crystal structure
prediction and first-principles calculations, we have performed extensive
simulations on the crystal structures of YSHn (n = 1–10) compounds from ambient
pressure to 200 GPa. We uncovered three thermodynamically stable compounds
with stoichiometries of YSH, YSH2, and YSH5,
which became energetically stable at ambient pressure, 143, and 87
GPa, respectively. Remarkably, it is found that YSH contains monoatomic
H atoms, while YSH2 and YSH5 contain a mixture
of atomlike and molecular hydrogen units. Upon compression, YSH, YSH2, and YSH5 undergo a transition from a semiconductor
to a metallic phase at pressures of 168, 143, and 232 GPa, respectively.
Unfortunately, electron–phonon coupling calculations reveal
that these compounds possess a weak superconductivity with a relatively
low Tc (below 1 K), which mainly stem
from the low value of density of states occupation at the Fermi level
(EF). These results highlight that the
crystal structures play a critical role in determining the high-temperature
superconductivity.

Introduction
Much
efforts have been devoted into the investigation of hydrogen-containing
systems at extreme conditions, such as in the field of superconductivity
(e.g., compressed hydrogen sulfides,1−3 lanthanum hydrides4−7) and hydrogen-storage materials (e.g., RhH2,88 lithium borohydrides,9 lithium beryllium hydrides10,11), where high pressure12 is a useful tool
for helping design and synthesize the compounds that are not accessible
at ambient conditions. H3S, being one of most successful
examples, was observed with Tc of 203
K at 150 GPa;3 such a record high value
of Tc at that time led to a subsequent
surge in theoretical and experimental studies.1,13−23 Further studies reveal that the Tc of
203 K arises mainly from the dissociation product of H2S at high pressure, H3S;2,15,17 also, in this cubic symmetry structure (Im3̅m phase), one S atom is linked to 6 H atoms
to form strong H–S covalent bonds, which may play a key role
in producing high Tc value in the H3S system.23−26 Several H–S compounds (e.g., H2S, HS2, H4S3, H5S2, and H5S8)1,13,17,19 have subsequently been identified under
high pressure as well. Beside the above-mentioned H–S compounds,
abroad range of hydrogen-containing materials have also attracted
considerable attention under high pressure, e.g., iron hydrides,27,28 LaH10, YH10,4,5 etc. Remarkably,
unique sodalite-like hydrogen cages are interpreted to play a key
role in improving the superconductivity of YH6 (H24 cages) and YH10 (H32 cages), as estimated
with Tc of 250–320 K at high pressure,
which have much higher Tc than fcc-YH3 (∼40 K) is found at lower pressure.4,5,29

YS, one of the monochalcogenides of
yttrium, has recently received
great attention as a result of the finding of superconducting nature
(∼2 K) at ambient conditions with a NaCl-type structure.30,31 Upon compression, the NaCl-type phase was found to transform into
the CsCl-type structure at around 50 GPa.31,32 However, the superconducting nature of this material was suppressed
with increasing pressure, where Tc decreases
monotonically with pressure and no superconductivity was observed
in the CsCl-type phase at high pressure.33

Recently, ternary hydrides are considered as promising candidates
for high-temperature superconductors, since a high Tc is predicted in compressed ternary hydrides. Moreover,
some transition-metal hydrides are also synthesized at a relatively
low pressure (below 10 GPa),34 indicating
it may be feasible to search for high Tc materials in ternary hydrides at low pressure. Since superconducting
YS compound is found to be stable at ambient pressure, a natural question
is what if YS and hydrogen (YS–H compounds) are mixed together
at high pressure. In view of a possibly novel structure and superconductivity
of the YS–H system and so to better understand novel physicochemical
properties at high pressure, we have performed extensive simulations
on YS–H compounds up to 200 GPa. Three stable compounds, YSH,
YSH2, and YSH5, are obtained, with monoatomic
H atoms in the YSH structures, while YSH2 and YSH5 were found to contain a mixture of atomic H and molecular H2. All the predicted compounds became metallic phases with
weak superconductivity, which demonstrates that the crystal structure
plays an essential role in determining a high superconductivity.

Results
and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the
thermodynamic stability of YSHn by calculating
the formation enthalpy dissociation into YS and solid H2, where YS is a reference decomposition product of YSHn since YS compound has been experimentally reported
at ambient pressure. It is clearly seen that three thermodynamically
stable compounds with stoichiometries of YSH, YSH2, and
YSH5 are predicted at high pressure, as shown in Figure 1. The optimized structural
parameters of the predicted structures are summarized in Table S1.

into YS and
H2 (P63/m and C2/c) from 0 to 200 GPa. Data points on
the convex hull (solid lines) represent species stable toward any
type of decomposition. The structures of YS and H2 are
from the refs (31) and (35), respectively.

YSH is found to be energetically stable from ambient pressure
to
200 GPa (Figures 1 and 2a), which is the highest pressure studied in the
current work. It is not unreasonable that the YSH compound adopted
a lower-energy electronic configuration, satisfying the octet rule
that two of the three extra valence electrons of the Y atom are assigned
to the S atom and the rest belong to the H atom.

YSH compound was found to undergo
the following complicated phase
transitions at 0 K as a function of pressure (Figure 2b)  At ambient
pressure, it is predicted that
the hexagonal P6̅m2 YSH is
stable. With increasing pressure, this phase becomes unstable and
transforms to the P63/mmc structure at 48 GPa (Figures 2a and 3b). It is noteworthy that both P6̅m2 and P63/mmc contain S-sharing YS6 units,
while the only difference lies in the stacking pattern of the YS6 units. For example, in the P6̅m2 structure, the YS6 units contain the same
Y–S bond length (2.86 Å at 0 GPa) aligned along the (0
0 1) direction, whereas for P63/mm, the YS6 units (Y–S 2.48–2.51
Å at 80 GPa) are centrosymmetric with the point of the S atom
in the unit cell (Figure 3b).

and small colored spheres represent Y, S, and H atoms, respectively.
Nonequivalent H atoms are labeled with numbers in different colors.

The stacking pattern of YS6 building
blocks in YSH is
similar to the MoS6 units in the corresponding P6̅m2 and P63/mmc structures of MoS2,36 respectively. Upon compression, orthorhombic Pnma symmetry (Figure 3c), also consisting of YS6 units with Y–S
(2.37–2.50 Å) becomes stable above 125 GPa. Eventually,
YSH is stabilized as a monoclinic C2/m at 175 GPa (Figure 3d), which is composed of YS7 units, and the Y–S
bonds have a bond length of 2.37–2.40 Å at 200 GPa. All
H atoms exist as atomlike hydrogen in the YSH structures, which is
well explained in ref (37) by introducing an effective additional electron.

Besides YSH,
YSH2 and YSH5 emerge at the
convex hull with increasing pressure. YSH2 is stable against
decomposition to YSH and YSH5 at 143 GPa with the symmetry
space group Imm2 (Figures 2c and 3e). The compound
contains two layers of YS8 bridged by Y atoms, forming
four Y–S bonds. The YS8 units are similar to those
found in the YS CsCl structure. However, at 200 GPa, the Y–S
bond lengths in YSH2 are slightly different (four bonds
are 2.36 Å and the rest are 2.40 Å), whereas the Y–S
bonds in YS have the same length of 2.40 Å.

The unit cell
with Imm2 symmetry contains two
molecular H2 units and four monoatomic H atoms. The H2 units are oriented along the [1 0 0] direction with the bond
length of 0.87 Å at 200 GPa. The electron localization function
of the intermolecular bond has a rather high value of (0.92), indicating
the strong covalent feature of H–H bonds (Figure S1e). The H–H bond lengths are longer than those
of a typical hydrogen molecule (0.74 Å) at ambient condition.
The mixture of atomlike and molecular hydrogen has also been reported
in binary Ca–H compounds37,38 and Mg–H compounds.39

YSH5 with a symmetry space
group Cmc21 becomes energetically stable
at 87 GPa and remains
stable at least up to 200 GPa (Figures 2d and 3f). The unit cell contains
four YS5 units with S-sharing atoms, eight H2 molecules, and four monoatomic hydrogen atoms. Unlike YSH2, half of the H2 molecules in YSH5 are equivalent
H atoms (blue, labeled 4 in Figure 3f) with an H–H length of 0.836 Å along
the [1 0 0] direction, and the rest (labeled 1 and 3 in Figure 3f) are parallel to the bc planes with a longer H–H length (0.862 Å)
at 200 GPa.

To better understand the electronic properties of
predicted structures,
we have performed the electronic band structures and projected density
of states for these stable compounds as summarized in Figures 4 and 5. The results reveal that YSH is a semiconductor with an indirect
band gap of 1.62 eV at ambient pressure (Figure 4a). With increasing pressure, the gap gradually
narrows to a direct band gap of 1.41 eV (Figure 4b) at 50 GPa, then to 0.17 eV at 130 GPa
(Figure 4c), eventually,
followed by a metallic C2/m phase
(Figure 4d).

YSH5 as a function of pressure.

To investigate the possible phase transition, we perform the structure
prediction of YSH5 from ambient pressure to 300 GPa. The Cmc21 structure, which is the stable phase of
YSH5 over the studied pressure range, is initially semiconducting
with an indirect band gap of 1.44 eV at 90 GPa (Figure 5a) and metallized at 235 GPa (Figure 5d). Further prediction of the
structure of YSH5 confirmed that Cmc21 is the stable phase at least up to 300 GPa. The metallic Imm2 nature of YSH2 can be determined by one
band, mainly from the Y 4d orbital, crossing the EF, indicating a weak metallic nature, which is confirmed
by the low value (∼0.020 states/eV) occupation at the EF of the density of states (DOS) (Figure 4c). The weak metallic nature
is also found in metallic YSH (Figure 4d) and YSH5 (Figure 5b) with negligible occupation of states at EF.

The dynamic stability of these structures
is confirmed by the absence
of imaginary frequencies in their calculated phonon dispersions40 (Figure 6). The frequencies in YSH compounds are well-distinguished
between H atoms and Y/S atoms; i.e., the heavier S and Y atoms contribute
lower frequencies and higher frequencies are related to H atoms. The
stretching vibrations (>80 THz) are assigned to the H2 units
in YSH2 and YSH5 compounds and lower frequencies
correspond to the H bending vibrations.

Given the high Tc of binary Y–H
and S–H compounds, we also performed electron–phonon
coupling calculations within the framework of BCS theory. However,
the estimated Tc is less than 1 K (Table S2), which is much lower than those of
H3S (200 K2), YH10 (300 K4,5), and YH6 (250 K29). In fact, it is not unreasonable that a low value of DOS
occupation exists at EF. The S–H
and Y–H bonding in the YSHn compounds
is investigated further by plotting the electron localization functions
(Figure S1). No electron localization in
YSH is found between H and S (Y) atoms in Figure S1a–d, ruling out the strong covalent feature in H–S
(Y) bonding, which has been reported to be responsible for the high Tc of H3S.23 The possible charge transfer is explored by calculating the charge
density difference (Figure 7). The charge density is depleted on the Y atoms and increased
on the S and H atoms in all the YSHn compounds,
which reflects their ionic nature. By calculating the Bader charge
using the quantum atoms in molecular41 analysis
(Table S3), we find that the Y atoms donate
1.87 e– per atom at ambient pressure, from which
S atoms gain 1.27 e– and H atoms accept the rest,
0.60 e–, in YSH. The amount of transferred charge
decreases slightly when the pressure increases (1.5 and 1.34 e– at 150 and 200 GPa, respectively), but the ionic nature
of S (Y)–H does not change. In contrast, there is almost no
charge transfer (−0.05 e–) between H2 and Y atoms in YSH2. Generally, metals with small
charge transfer are not expected be good superconductors because the
metallization comes from the broadening of the H– and H2 δ* antibonding orbital,36 which is also found in the I4/mmm symmetry compound, CaH4.37,38 For YSH5, the charge transfer between H2 and
Y atoms increases to 0.18 e– and Tc slightly increases to 0.70 K; however, the superconductivity
is still weak due to low value of DOS occupation at EF.

0.009 e/bohr

correspond to those in Figure 3. The gain and loss of charge are denoted by yellow and cyan,
respectively.

Conclusions
We have systematically
investigated the crystal structures and
stabilities of a YSHn ternary system under
high pressure using swarm-intelligence structure prediction methodology
within the first-principles electronic structure framework. Three
stable ternary hydrides, YSH, YSH2, and YSH5, were identified by structural prediction under high pressure. Only
atomlike H species were found in YSH compounds. However, the stable
structures of YSH2 and YSH5 contained mixed
atomic H and molecular H2. YSH, YSH2, and YSH5 can be metallized at pressures of 168, 143, and 232 GPa,
respectively. The electron–phonon coupling calculations reveal
that YSH, YSH2, and YSH5 have weak superconductivities
due to the low value of DOS occupation at EF. The high symmetry of the structures is favorable for achieving
a high Tc superconductivity compared with
the high Tc of the corresponding binary
hydrides, fcc YH10 and cubic SH3. Our work provides
a new guidance for future experimental work on the Y–S–H
ternary system.

Computational Details
A crystal
structure search was performed with the CALYPSO code42,43 based on a particle swarm optimization algorithm whose validity
has been verified by correctly predicting various crystal structures
under high pressure.37,44−51 To investigate the properties of the YS–H system, first,
we performed systematic structure searches of H-rich concentration
of YSHn (n = 1–10)
with a maximum four formula units per simulation cell at 10, 50, 100,
150, and 200 GPa. Each generation contains 50 structures. The first
generation of the crystal structures is generated randomly with some
symmetry constraints and subsequent optimizations. For the subsequent
generations, 60% of the structures with the lowest enthalpy are selected
in the previous generation to form the next generation through the
particle swarm optimization algorithms, while the rest 40% are generated
randomly. The structure search was considered converged when ∼1000
successive structures were generated after a lowest energy structure
was found. The underlying ab initio structural relaxations were performed
using density functional theory with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
functional of the generalized gradient approximation52 as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package.53 The all-electron projector-augmented wave (PAW)
method was used with the PAW potentials,54 where 4s24p65s24d1,
3s23p4, and 1s1 are treated as valence
electrons for the Y, S, and H atoms, respectively. A cutoff energy
for the expansion of the wave function into the plane wave basis was
set to 1000 eV. The Monkhorst–Pack k-point
meshes55 with a grid density of 0.20 Å–1 were chosen to ensure that the total energy convergence
is better than 1 meV per atom. The electron–phonon coupling
calculations were performed within the framework of the linear response
theory through Quantum-ESPRESSO code.56 Ultrasoft pseudopotentials for Y, S, and H were used with a kinetic
cutoff energy of 80 Ry. The crystal structures and ELF are plotted
using the VESTA software.57
