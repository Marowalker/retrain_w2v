At present, liquid phase adsorption
(LPA) is still being quantitatively
characterized in the way of manual sampling and off-line determination
because of the complexity of the system comparing to gas adsorption.
This paper describes a novel method for in situ, real-time measurement
of LPA in general based on fiber-optic sensing (FOS) with the aid
of membranes for the first time. A self-made measurement vessel was
assembled from an adsorption bag, thermostatic devices with a stirrer,
and a fiber-optic dipping probe. Also, macroporous adsorption resins
(MARs) and rutin were chosen as model adsorbent and adsorbate to establish
the FOS system. Here, in situ light absorption measurement was achieved
by eliminating interference of adsorbent particles via encapsulating
them with a membrane into the adsorption bag. In situ LPA measurement
of rutin solution on MARs was obtained by detecting light absorption
at 353 nm using dipping probe, in the broad concentration range from
0.3 to 60 mg/L with excellent linearity (R2 = 0.9996). In situ measurements of adsorption and desorption kinetics
on five kinds of MARs with different polarities were systematically
carried out, showing that the adsorption process obeyed the pseudo-second-model.
As well as, the system was proved to be highly accurate and reproducible.
More importantly, this method enabled to study the initial stage of
the adsorption process, starting from the time of the first second,
which is the most important part in the adsorption kinetics, and this
is impossible for traditional sampling methods. The successful application
of FOS to in situ measurement of LPA not only contributes to fast,
automatic, and real-time monitoring of LPA process but also enriches
the research connotation of adsorption.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Adsorption
is one of the most common phenomenon in nature.1 It is a surface phenomenon and is defined as
the increase in concentration of a particular component at the surface
or interface between two phases.2 The theory
of gas phase adsorption has been developed relatively early and grown
rapidly to maturity. The real-time in situ kinetic measurements were
assembled for the first time by Thomas in 1991.3 In situ gas-phase thermal desorption spectroscopy to investigate
the adsorption/desorption of hydrogen was reported by Takenouchi in
2015.4 In contrast, liquid phase adsorption
(LPA) has been used in much wider areas, such as environmental remediation,5 purification of pharmaceuticals,6,7 and separation and purification of some components from the aqueous
solution.8,9 However, nowadays LPA is still being investigated
in a traditional way of manual sampling coupled with off-line determination.

Conventionally, the measurement of LPA includes several steps as
follows:10 (i) adsorbents with certain
weights are placed into a vessel, usually a conical flask, and a adsorbate
solution with a given volume and concentration is added; (ii) after
sealing the vessel, it is mounted in a thermostatic bath with agitation;
(iii) after some time, a portion of the solution mixture is withdrawn
from the vessel, centrifuged, or/and filtered; and (iv) finally, adsorption
is analyzed by analytical techniques such as spectrophotometry or
chromatography. Although so sophisticated modern analytical techniques
such as LC–MS/MS11,12 and GC–MS13 have been applied in the adsorption measurement,
there are still many challenging issues.

The traditional procedure
usually suffers from error and labor
consumption due to manual sampling as well as from very limited data
because frequent sampling easily causes big change to the adsorption
system in terms of solution volume, adsorbent amount, and the ratio
between the two. Another issue challenging to conventional methods
is the broad distribution of adsorption time. Some adsorptions, for
example, methyl blue on boron nitride fibrous networks14 and benzotriazoles on zeolitic imidazolate framework-8,15 have fast rate, which only need 1 min to reach
more than 50% adsorption and 5 min to equilibrium, respectively; some,
on the other hand, have very slow adsorption rate, for example, rutin
on HPD850 costing more than 70 h to approach equilibrium.15,16 Continuous monitoring of solution to investigate the adsorption
kinetics was achieved using a circulating pump and an interferometer,10 but the device is quite complex and not suitable
for common adsorption systems. Adsorption of 4-nitrophenol on chitosan-based
molecularly imprinted membrane was measured in situ in the cuvette
by Di Bello in 2017,17 but this method
is only suitable for the systems which have sufficient optically transparent
window and for a volume of no more than few milliliters. In order
to reduce the measurement procedure, some scholars applied adsorption
bag made by nylon mesh and other materials in the batch adsorption
and achieved direct determination of solution concentration without
centrifugation or filtration at equilibrium.6,18,19 However, they still needed sampling of the
solution. The more the volume and the number of sampling, the greater
effect on the adsorption system and the more significant error were
caused. Therefore, in situ, automatic and fast responsive analytical
instrumentations/techniques are urgently required to be developed
for LPA measurement.

Fiber-optic sensing (FOS) technology has
become more mature and
popular because of acceptable costs, compact instrumentation, high
accuracy, and the capability of performing measurements in situ and
real time, after over 30 years of innovation.20 As is well known, fiber-optics enable direct measurement of optical
spectroscopy, from the infrared to the ultraviolet, in absorption,
emission, and plasmonic resonance, to be performed at inaccessible
sites, over large distances, in strong magnetic fields, and in harsh
environments.21,22 Among the spectroscopy, the FOS
based on UV–vis absorption has gained the most wide application
owing to its low cost, simplicity, and high precision, typically in
drug dissolution testing.20,23−25 For the first time, Josefson reported a dissolution testing method,
using felodipine tablet as an example, by means of optical fiber absorption
spectrophotometer in turbid solution.26 Using this method, it is enabled to achieve in situ, real-time,
and complete process measurement of tablet dissolution. Since then,
optical fiber absorption spectrophotometer has been widely used alone20 and along with other techniques in highly diversified
fields such as in situ study of catalytic kinetics, energy material
characterization, explosive detection,27−29 and on-line sample preparation.30,31

Therefore, we purposed to present a novel method for in situ,
real-time
measurement of LPA based on FOS with UV–vis absorption. The
key component of the self-made FOS system was an adsorption vessel,
which contained a conical flask, magnetic stirrer, fiber-optic probe,
and adsorption bag. Macroporous adsorption resin (MAR) adsorbent and
rutin (chemical structure shown in Figure S1) adsorbate were chosen as study models because they have been much
investigated and well established.22,23,32,33 Also, the aspects of
adsorption behavior, stability, reproducibility, and precision of
the FOS system, as well as related comparison with traditional methods,
were investigated in detail. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first report on in situ, automatic measurement of LPA for general
sorbents, showing simplicity, high compatibility, and high accuracy.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Quantitative Determination
of Rutin Solution
Using the FOS System
As shown in Figure 1, excellent linearity at 353 nm over the
range of 0.3–60 mg/L was attained, showing the regression equation
of A = 0.016C + 0.002 (R2 = 0.9996), where A relates to the absorbance
of rutin and C corresponds to the concentration of
rutin (mg/L). The result suggested that in situ measurement of LPA
could be realized by quantitative determination of rutin solution
by using the self-made FOS system.

Figure 1 Absorption spectra and calibration curve
of rutin aqueous solutions,
the detection and reference wavelength were 353 and 453 nm, respectively.

2.2 Effect
of Membranes
In this study,
we utilized large pore nylon net for making the adsorption bag. To
evaluate the effect of nylon net on the adsorption of the MARs, batch
adsorption was carried out with an empty bag as shown in Figure S2, and the nylon net did not adsorb rutin
at all, indicating that its effect can be neglected. As for the effect
of nylon net on the mass transfer in the form of adsorption bag, it
was also demonstrated to be ignored. The effect of adsorption bag
can be further minimized by optimization of the material and pore
of the net bag.

2.3 Accuracy and Stability
of the FOS System
In this experiment, the variance analysis
of adsorption capacity
was adopted to test the accuracy and stability of the in situ adsorption
system. The adsorption kinetic curves of rutin on AB-8 at 30 °C
were obtained from six parallel experiments, as shown in the Figure S3, and the variance of adsorption capacity
at every point were calculated by software program, Origin 9.0, as
shown in the Figure S4.

The variance
was found to be in the range of 0.82 and 2.55% for repetitive experiments
tested by the FOS system. Also, there is no significant difference,
indicating that the system can be well applied to in situ measurement
of adsorption kinetics in batch adsorption/desorption with good stability,
reliable data, and simple instrumentation.

2.4 Comparison
of the Traditional Method
The need for a fast, accurate,
and in situ detection has motivated
us to develop an automatic, simple, accurate, high-precision, and
wide-application method for LPA measurement. The outstanding feature
of the optical-fiber-sensing LPA is that the whole process of adsorption
is monitored in situ and real-time.

The adsorption capacities
of rutin on resins were analyzed by the in situ LPA method and the
traditional method, respectively, as shown in Figures 2 and S5. As seen,
the regression equation of in situ adsorption method versus traditional
theoretical method was y = 0.9216x + 4.254 (R2 = 0.9975). It can be found
that there was a good linear relationship between values obtained
from the two methods. The slope and intercept of the line were satisfactorily
close to the ideal values.34,35 Statistical analysis
of the results shows that at the 95% level of confidence, the calculated t value and F value (Table S2) indicated that the proposed method was as precise
and accurate as the conventional method. These results indicated that
the in situ LPA method is in good agreement with the traditional method.

Figure 2 Comparison
of adsorption capacity from the in situ method and the
conventional method for rutin on different MARs (HPD500, NKA-9, D101,
AB-8, HPD300), C0 = 60 mg/L, T = 20 °C.

2.5 Adsorption
Kinetic Curves on the Resins
Adsorption kinetics is one of
the most important characteristics,
which is responsible for the efficiency of sorption. During adsorption,
the absorbance–time curve and the adsorption curves of rutin
on resins (AB-8, D101, HPD300, HPD500, NKA-9) of different polarity
are shown in Figure 3. It is clear that the adsorption capacity of rutin increased rapidly
at the early stage (up to 75% uptake); the possible reason is that
the diffusion rate of rutin to the macroporous pore is very fast because
of plenty of binding sites and very high concentration of adsorbate
available at this stage. Then, the adsorption rate slowed down gradually
until it reached an equilibrium, after which there was no significant
increase in rutin adsorption. It was also found that the adsorption
rate and the capacity of rutin on nonpolar (HPD300, D101) and weakly
polar (AB-8) resins are much higher than that of other resins, as
shown in Figure 4.
This means that functional groups of resin had a primary effect on
rutin adsorption.

kinetic curves of rutin on different MARs in aqueous solution, C0 = 60 mg/L, T = 20 °C,
measured at 353 nm.

bars) and desorption ratio (blue line)
of rutin on different MARs in aqueous solution, C0 = 60 mg/L, n = 3.

2.6 Desorption Kinetic Curves
Ethanol
aqueous solution (v/v = 70%:30%) was used as the desorption solvent,
and the corresponding in situ desorption curves are shown in Figure 5a,b. It was obvious
that rutin can be desorbed rapidly at the first 15 min and can be
completely desorbed from all the tested resins. The desorption ratio
was higher than 75% in the cases of all five resins, shown in Figure 4. The result of adsorption
and desorption processes indicate that the system can be used for
rapid detection of in situ adsorption and desorption measurement.
Also, the resins can be used for the adsorption of flavonoids and
easy to regenerate.

the desorption
process, (b) desorption curves of rutin on different MARs (the desorption
solution was ethanol aqueous solution; T = 30 °C).

2.7 Adsorption
Kinetic Models of Rutin on Resins
In general, the kinetic
models such as pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order
models are applied to predict the sorption kinetics of rutin adsorption36,37 (Figure 6). The pseudo-first-order
model assumes that the physical adsorption process (the interactions
between the adsorbent and the adsorbate are van der Waals force, the
hydrogen bond force, etc.) is the rate-controlling step, whereas the
pseudo-second-order model assumes that the chemisorption of the adsorbate
onto the active adsorption sites (electron sharing and electron exchange
between the adsorbent and the adsorbate) is the rate-controlling step,
and the linear form of the two models are described by the following
equations 1   2  where k1 and k2 are pseudo-first-order rate constant (min–1) and
pseudo-second-order rate constant (g·mg–1·min–1), qt and qe (mg·g–1) are the adsorption amount at time t and equilibrium,
respectively.

Figure 6 Fitting results of rutin on resins for adsorption kinetic
models,
(a) pseudo-first-order model and (b) pseudo-second-order model: C0 = 60 mg/L; t = 26 h.

Table 1 lists the
fitting parameters, such as adsorption capacities (Q), adsorption rate constant (k), and the correlation
coefficients (R2) of the adsorption kinetic
curves. The correlation coefficients obtained from the pseudo-first-order
kinetic model are all smaller than 0.99. However, the correlation
coefficients from the pseudo-second-order kinetic model are in between
0.99 and 1 except for that of HPD500, and it is better than that of
pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The theoretical value of qe from the pseudo-first-order kinetic model
is significantly lower than that of the experimental data. Therefore,
the pseudo-second-order model is more suitable for this adsorption.
In addition, the initial adsorption rate v0 of the five resins described by v0 = k2qe2 was
calculated from the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and was 1.055,
1.052, 0.2907, 0.7042, and 0.9099 mg·g–1·min–1, respectively. Among them, AB-8 showed the highest
initial adsorption rate for rutin and this result was in good agreement
with data on the reported work.38

3 Conclusions
To conclude, a new method based on the self-made FOS system was
developed for in situ, real-time measurement of LPA by making good
use of FOS and membrane separation. It opened a new path to circumvent
the absence of method for fast (few minutes) adsorption and lack of
automatic measurement. FOS allowed the system to collect several adsorption
data in every second and operate several days continuously. The system
can eliminate human error and operation fatigue thanks to in situ
measurement and thereby ensured high accuracy and high reproducibility
owing to all-in-one pot, automatic process with strictly controlled
condition. In order to realize the full scientific and commercial
opportunities enabled by this technique, many more studies remain
to be performed, and including application of the system for the measurement
of adsorption thermodynamics, alternative adsorption measurement vessels,
and validation of the system in wide variety of adsorptions and in
real samples (such as plant extractions) will be investigated. Furthermore,
some new insights into the LPA and adsorption will be gained.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Five
macroporous resins
(MARs) including AB-8, D101, HPD300, HPD500, HPD600, and NKA-9 were
purchased from Cangzhou Bon Adsorber Technology Co., Ltd (Hebei, China).
Rutin was obtained from (Nanjing, China) with a purity higher than
98%. Analytical grade methanol and ethanol were purchased from Sinopharm
Chemical Reagent (Shanghai, China) and ultrapure water was obtained
from a water purification system (Chengdu, China).

4.2 Instrumentation
The components for
in situ fiber-optic detection system for LPA and their photographs
are shown in Figures 7 and S6, respectively. The system consists
of a stable and continuous source of spectrum light (195–644
nm) which was provided by a DH-2000 deuterium tungsten halogen source.
An HR2000 charge-coupled device spectrophotometer was connected to
the light source by a fiber-optic dipping probe (all parts from Ocean
Optics, Dunedin, Florida, USA). The probe includes an Al-coated mirror,
an illumination fiber, and all mounted in stainless steel cylinders.
Adsorption vessel mainly contains a conical flask, magnetic stirrer,
adsorption bag, and fiber-optic probe.

of the in situ real-time measurement system
of liquid phase adsorption.

4.3 Activation of MARs
Five MARs’
physical properties are listed in Table S1. Certain amounts of MARs were sealed into a 100-mesh nylon porous
bag (2 × 2 cm) and placed into a conical flask with a cover,
and then, the resins were first soaked in ethanol for 46 h and then
washed (the white turbidity) with ultrapure water till no residual
ethanol could be detected.19 After being
dried naturally, the activated and purified MARs were obtained in
the form of adsorption bag.

4.4 Rutin Standard Solutions
A stock
solution of rutin was prepared by dissolving 0.0600 g rutin with ultrapure
water at 80 °C and then transferred into a 1000 mL volumetric
flask after cooling down to room temperature.19 Different portions were accurately pipetted from standard solution
into several 100 mL volumetric flasks and diluted with water to obtain
a series of standard solutions in the range of 0.3–60 mg/L,
respectively.

4.5 System Configuration and
Standard Curve
The rutin solution concentration was detected
by the in situ fiber-optic
spectrophotometer at 353 nm according to the procedures as follows:
(1) deuterium light source was turned on for at least 30 min to pre-warm,
and then, the spectra suite software was opened, the integration time
was adjusted to 18 ms, and the smoothing width was set to 5. (2) An
optical probe with a 5 mm light path was selected for the measurement
and dipped into blank solvent (water), the signal intensity level
was adjusted to 3500 counts at the corresponding detection wavelength
(353 nm), and reference and dark spectra were stored. (3) The probe
was dipped into the vessels that contain 3 mL of rutin solution of
different concentrations, respectively. Then, the absorbance of each
rutin solution was obtained. The same system configuration was used
for the rest of the experiment.

4.6 In Situ
Adsorption and Desorption Kinetics
4.6.1 Adsorption
Test
Before each adsorption
experiment, the corresponding spectral parameters were adjusted to
the same as subsection 4.5. After configuring the parameters, the probe immersed in
the adsorption vessel, which was filled with 200 mL of the rutin solution
at 20 °C. Then, the time sequence test function was activated
with setting the detection and reference wavelengths to 353 and 453
nm, respectively. After that, 0.1 g of pretreated resin adsorption
bag was put into the vessel with magnetic stirring at 310 rpm. The
absorbance of the rutin solution was recorded at a frequency of 4/s.
If the absorption change is not more than 0.002 within 2 h (slope ΔA/Δt < 0.001), it is decided that
the adsorption reaches apparent equilibrium stage. In the end, the
light source was switched off and the data were stored. With these
procedures, the time–absorbance curve at 353 nm (Figure S7) was obtained according to the confirmed
parameters. The rutin concentration in the adsorption process was
determined with a fiber-optic spectrometer at different time intervals
until equilibrium. The adsorption capacity of the rutin was calculated
by using eq 3 3  where Qt stands for the adsorption capacity of the MARs at
the time t (mg/g), C0 for initial rutin
concentration and Ct stands
for the rutin concentration (mg/L) at time t, V is the volume of the adsorption solution (L), and m indicates the weight of the MARs (g).

4.6.2 Desorption Test
After the adsorption
reached equilibrium, the adsorption bags were removed and washed twice
with ultrapure water. The signal intensity level was adjusted to 3500
counts in the blank solvent, which was ethanol solution (v/v, 70%
ethanol/water). Then, the adsorption bag was put into the flask, which
contains 100 mL of ethanol solution at 30 °C with magnetic stirring
at 310 rpm. The absorbance of rutin at every 250 ms was recorded until
desorption equilibrium by in situ fiber-optic spectrometry. Then,
the desorption capacity of each rutin on the resin was calculated
according to eq 4 4  where Dc and D denote
the desorption capacity and desorption ratio (%),
respectively, Cd is the concentration
of the rutin in the final desorption solution (mg/L), Vd represents the volume of the desorption solution (L), Qe stands for the adsorption capacity of the
MARs (mg/g), and m is the weight of the MARs (g).
