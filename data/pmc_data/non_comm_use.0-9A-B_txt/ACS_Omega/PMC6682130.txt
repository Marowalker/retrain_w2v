Ferric ions (Fe3+ ions) and l-cysteine (( l-Cys) in the
human body have always played an irreplaceable
role in biological processes, and overload or deficiency of Fe3+ ions and l-Cys in the biological system leads to
various diseases. In this work, N,S-co-doped red-emitting carbon dots
(R-CDs) were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method. Because
the doping of N and S gives a unique functional group distribution
on the surface of R-CDs, it can be complexed with Fe3+ ions
to construct an energy transfer quenching system. However, the presence
of l-Cys competitively binds to Fe3+ ions, thus
resulting in the photoluminescence recovery of R-CDs. Therefore, a
“switch-on” dual function sensing platform has successfully
been developed based on R-CDs for rapid identification and quantification
of Fe3+ ions and l-Cys. The linear detection range
of Fe3+ ions is 0–30 μM (limit of detection
(LOD): 0.27 μM) and that of l-Cys is 0–24 μM
(LOD: 0.14 μM). The sensor platform was used to detect Fe3+ ions and l-Cys in human serum samples with satisfactory
results. Compared with traditional detection methods, this method
is more time-saving and efficient and can be completed in 3 min. It
is worth mentioning that the R-CDs not only has high optical stability
but also has negligible cytotoxicity and has been successfully applied
to in vitro/vivo imaging, indicating that R-CDs have excellent tissue
penetration and biomarker potential. More interestingly, the switch-on
fluorescence behavior for stepwise detection of Fe3+ ions
and l-Cys can also be observed in cell imaging, which provides
the possibility of visual detection of the probe to be applied in
vivo.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Trace
metals and thiol-containing amino acids in the human body
have always played an irreplaceable role in biological processes.
Therefore, they have been widely concerned by researchers. In particular,
Fe3+ ions are essential trace elements in organisms and
play a vital role in body metabolism. l-Cys is mainly involved
in maintaining the homeostasis of physiological redox in the body,
and overload or deficiency of Fe3+ ions and l-Cys
in the biological system leads to various diseases (cardiovascular
disease, anemia, heart failure, diabetes, etc.).1−4 In addition, the occurrence of
cerebrovascular diseases is related to both Fe3+ ions and
cysteine. In view of the above situation, rapid identification and
quantification of them is very necessary.

Currently, there are
many methods for quantitatively detecting
Fe3+ ions and l-Cys. These methods mainly include
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS),5 inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry
(ICP-AES),6 atomic absorption spectrometry,
membrane separation,7 chromatographic separation,8 and capillary electrophoresis.9 Although these methods are widely used, the disadvantages
such as time consuming, cumbersome operation, expensive equipment,
poor selectivity, and low detection efficiency are in urgent need
of improvement. Therefore, the development of a fast, accurate, environment-friendly,
and rapid sensing platform for Fe3+ ions and l-Cys is of great significance.

Fluorescent probe-based chemical
probes have outstanding performance
in terms of rapid response, easy operation, and specific recognition.
In particular, when carbon dots (CDs) are used as fluorescent probes,
they not only have good optical properties but also are environmentally
friendly chemical sensing platforms. Compared to fluorescent dyes
and semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), CDs have significant advantages
in terms of photobleaching resistance, low cost, and biocompatibility.
CDs have been widely researched in recent years for potential applications
in biosensing, biomedical, catalysis, and optoelectronic devices.10−15 Many types of heteroatom-doped CDs have been prepared, and they
are widely used in sensing. However, most sensing platforms display
emission only in short wavelength regions under UV excitation.16 Therefore, previously reported fluorescent probes
based on heteroatom-doped CDs have been difficult to apply to biologically
relevant fields. For example, Huang et al. synthesized nitrogen-doped
blue CQDs, which could be used as determination elements for the detection
of l-Cys.17 According to Chen
et al., blue-emitting tea-CDs obtained by using waste tea extract
as a carbon source, as an “on–off–on”
fluorescent nanosensor of the tea-CDs, can be used for sensitive detection
of CrO42–, Fe3+, AA, and l-Cys.18 Zhang et al. prepared blue-emitting
CDs using citric acid as a carbon source and ammonia solution as a
nitrogen source, which can be developed into an effective fluorescence
sensing platform for detecting l-Cys.19 First, compared to the reported CDs,20−23 R-CDs not only have good tissue
penetration but also are easier to prepare. Therefore, it is more
suitable for detection in vivo. Second, Qu et al. developed a glutathione-based
functionalized graphene quantum dot for the identification of Fe3+ ions.24 In contrast, it is simpler
than the method of imparting a special surface state of CDs by doping
of heteroatoms for identifying Fe3+ ions. Third, red-emitting
aqueous phase CDs were synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal method,
which is safer for detection of Fe3+ ions in living cells
than red-emitting sulfur, nitrogen codoped carbon dots synthesized
with an organic phase.25 Fourth, Ding et
al. synthesized B,N,S-co-doped red-emitting CDs using two raw materials,
and used it for detection of Fe3+ ions in complex biological
fluids and living cells.26 This work synthesized
N,S-co-doped red-emitting CDs using only one raw material. In contrast,
the preparation procedure is simpler and cheaper, and the fluorescent
probe based on the R-CDs can detect Fe3+ ions and can also
detect l-Cys in living cells. Finally, it is worth mentioning
that this method is more time-saving, more efficient, and can be completed
in a few minutes compared to the traditional detection methods.

In this study, red luminescent CDs codoped with sulfur and nitrogen
was prepared by a facile hydrothermal method using 2,5-diaminobenzenesulfonic
acid as the unique carbon precursor. R-CDs exhibit excellent monodispersity,
photobleaching resistance, storage resistance, and biosafety, and
more importantly, emit excitation-independent bright red fluorescence
for imaging in vivo and in vitro. What is more interesting is that
the CDs can be used to construct a dual-functional sensing platform
for ultrasensitive real-time detection of Fe3+ ions and l-Cys. It is worth mentioning that the “switch-on”
fluorescence behavior for cell imaging by reacting with Fe3+ ions and l-Cys, respectively, has been investigated. Finally,
the sensor platform was used to detect Fe3+ ions and l-Cys in human serum samples with satisfactory results.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization and Optical
Properties of
R-CDs
R-CDs were prepared by a facile hydrothermal method
using 2,5-diaminobenzenesulfonic acid as the sole raw material. Characterization
of particle size and morphology was determined by transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM). As shown in Figure 1A,B, the as-prepared
R-CDs are well dispersed spherical particles and the size is uniformly
distributed between 3 and 7 nm with an average diameter of about 4.88
± 0.4 nm. The HRTEM image shows high crystallinity with a lattice
fringe distance of 0.23 nm, corresponding to the (100) lattice plane
of graphene. The dry solid R-CD samples were then further characterized
using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectra. The XRD pattern,
as shown in Figure S2A, exhibits a peak
at 25.6°, which is the characteristic (002) diffraction peak
of graphite. Figure S2B illustrates the
Raman spectra of the R-CDs, showing two peaks at 1352 (D band) and
1574 cm–1 (G band), and the ratio of ID/IG is 1.19. As is known,
the ratio of ID/IG characterizes the degree of graphitization of the R-CDs.
Uniform particle size and good dispersibility indicate that the as-prepared
R-CDs exhibit excellent optical properties. As shown in Figure 1C, the R-CDs emitting at around
593 nm showed an excitation-independent feature, underlying the excitation
wavelength of 470–520 nm. This is probably due to the fact
that in larger CDs, the fluorescence emission is determined by the
size of the carbon skeleton, so that the CDs with uniform particle
size distribution exhibit excitation-independent fluorescence properties,
which is consistent with the research findings of Zhang et al.27 In Figure 1D, the UV spectrum exhibits two absorption peaks at
283 and 234 nm, which may be attributed to the π–π*
transition of C=N and C=C bonds. Also, there was a broad
absorption band at about 510 nm due to the surface state defects caused
by the doping of S and N. The absorption peak at 510 nm is close to
the excitation wavelength. Such a unique absorption feature imparts
red emission characteristics to the R-CDs.

wavelengths (C). UV–vis absorption spectra of the R-CDs dispersed
in water (D).

To further study the
fluorescence stability of the R-CD aqueous
solutions, the absolute quantum yield and fluorescence lifetime of
the quantum dots were measured, using a steady-state transient fluorescence
spectrometer (FL3-111). In Figure S2C,
the fluorescence decay of R-CDs occurring at 593 nm reveals a single
exponential fitting curve with an average lifetime of 2.8 ns. The
absolute quantum yield measured at an excitation wavelength of 500
nm is 2.67%. Likewise, the photoluminescence (PL) intensities are
still above 90% after 60 min under continuous excitation at 500 nm,
indicating that R-CDs exhibit excellent light stability (Figure S2D).

Subsequently, the elemental
composition and the surface functional
groups of R-CDs were further studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR). The full XPS spectra
presented in Figure S3 show four typical
peaks: S 2p (168 eV), C 1s (285 eV), N 1s (401 eV), and O 1s (532
eV), and their percentages are 4.5, 52.7, 27.7, and 15.1%, respectively. Figure 2 shows the high-resolution
spectra of four elements. The C 1s band can be deconvoluted into three
peaks, corresponding to sp2 carbons (C=C, 284.7
eV), sp3 carbons (C–N, 285.4 eV), and sp3 carbons (C–S/C–O, 285.8 eV) (Figure 2A).28,29 The N 1s band can be
deconvoluted into three peaks at 399.2, 400, and 401.3 eV, representing
pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, and amino N, respectively (Figure 2B).30 The O 1s band contains two peaks at 531.1 and 532.2 eV for S–O
and C–O, respectively (Figure 2C).31 The S 2p XPS spectrum
demonstrates three peaks centered at 168, 168.2, and 169.2 eV for
the −C–SOx- (x = 2, 3, and 4) species (Figure 2D).32,33 The FT-IR spectrum
of CDs displays a weak peak between 3125 and 3100 cm–1 and two characteristic peaks between 1600 and 1500 cm–1, indicating the presence of a pyrrole structure. Three bands at
the wavenumbers 1128, 1307, and 1413 cm–1 are characteristic
absorption peaks of C–C stretching frequencies and C–H
bending frequencies (Figure S4). The above
results show that the N,S-co-doped R-CDs were synthesized and the
surface of R-CDs were plentiful in amino, hydroxyl, and sulfhydryl
groups, a necessary condition for R-CDs to have excellent optical
properties and good water solubility.

2.2 Strategy of the Switch-On Detection of Fe3+ Ions and l-Cys
Based on the above characterization
results of R-CDs, we found that the successful doping of N and S resulted
in the presence of abundant functional groups on the surface of R-CDs.
It prompted us to further investigate the potential sensing applications
of R-CDs. It was found that Fe3+ ions have high quenching
efficiency for the fluorescence of R-CDs. Further screening revealed
that the presence of l-Cys could competitively bind Fe3+ ions, thus resulting in the PL recovery of R-CDs. More importantly,
the entire sensing process can be completed in a few minutes. Therefore,
we propose a switch-on dual function sensing platform for stepwise
detection of Fe3+ ions and l-Cys. The schematic
diagram of the entire inspection process is shown in Figure 3. The main reason why R-CDs
can specifically recognize and quantify Fe3+ ions is that
the surface of R-CDs is rich in N and S functional groups, which can
effectively complex Fe3+ ions. Due to the formation of
R-CDs/Fe3+ complexes, the electrons that promote the excited
state of the R-CDs are transferred to the semifilled orbit of the
Fe3+ ions, and therefore, the process of returning the
excited state to the ground state is blocked, so that the fluorescence
is quenched.2,34−36 Furthermore,
as shown in Figure S5, the absorption peak
of R-CDs at 510 nm was shifted due to the addition of Fe3+ ions, also indicating that R-CDs form a complex with Fe3+ ions. However, after adding l-Cys to the R-CDs/Fe3+ system, it was found that the blue-shifted absorption peak recovered.
This is attributed to the stronger complexation properties of l-Cys on Fe3+ ions than R-CDs.

of the switch-on dual function sensing platform
for detecting Fe3+ ions and l-Cys.

2.3 Fe3+ Ions and l-Cys Detection
Performance
l-Cys is one of the most important biothiols,
and Fe3+ is also a crucial trace element. They play a significant
role in human physiological processes. More importantly, l-Cys has a strong affinity for Fe3+ ions, which laid the
foundation for us to design a switch-on fluorescent sensing platform
for the quantitative detection of l-Cys. Therefore, we investigated
the feasibility of detecting Fe3+ ions by measuring the
FL intensity at 593 nm of an R-CD solution with various concentrations
of Fe3+ ions. As shown in Figure 4A, increasing the concentration of Fe3+ ions caused a decrease in the fluorescence intensity of
the R-CD system and the quenching efficiency [(F0 – F)/F0] displayed a good linear relationship (R2 = 0.9948) with the concentration of Fe3+ ions. The concentration
range of Fe3+ ions is 0–30 μM, where F0 and F are the FL intensities
of the R-CDs in the absence and presence of Fe3+ ions,
respectively. The fitted linear regression equation is Y = 0.03144x – 0.03113 (Figure 4B). The limit of detection (LOD) for Fe3+ is calculated to be 0.27 μM, based on 3 times the
signal-to-noise criteria. By increasing the concentration of Fe3+ ions, the fluorescence is gradually annihilated by the naked
eye under the illumination of a 450 nm light-emitting diode (LED)
lamp (Figure S6). Subsequently, Fe3+ ions with a concentration of 30 μM were selected as
the best quenching dose according to the quenching degree and quenching
efficiency of R-CD fluorescence. When different concentrations of l-Cys were introduced into the R-CDs/Fe3+ system,
the fluorescence of the R-CDs/Fe3+/l-Cys system
gradually recovered as the concentration of l-Cys increased,
as shown in Figure 4C. Furthermore, the recovery efficiency [(F0 – F)/F0] revealed a good linear relationship (R2 = 0.98527) with the concentration of l-Cys. The concentration
range of l-Cys is 0–24 μM, where F0 and F are the fluorescence intensities
of the aqueous R-CDs and Fe3+ mixture in the absence and
presence of l-Cys, respectively (Figure 4D). Furthermore, the LOD for l-Cys
is calculated to be 0.14 μM according to 3 times the signal-to-noise
criteria. When different concentrations of l-Cys were introduced
into the R-CDs/Fe3+ system, it was observed with the naked
eye that the fluorescence gradually recovered with the increase of
the concentration of l-Cys under the illumination of a 450
nm LED lamp (Figure S7). Finally, the optimal
reaction time of the fluorescence quenching of R-CDs by Fe3+ ions and the fluorescence recovery of l-Cys to the R-CDs/Fe3+ system were investigated (Figures S8 and S9). It has been found that both reactions can be completed
in less than 1 min, which means that the detection system can monitor
Fe3+ ions and l-Cys in real time.

(D).

2.4 Selectivity
of R-CDs for Fe3+ Ions
and l-Cys Detection
To assess the selectivity of
the sensor platform for Fe3+ ions and l-Cys, first,
the fluorescence spectra of the aqueous solution of R-CDs that coexisted
with different metal ions (Ag+, Cu2+, Pb2+, Fe3+, Fe2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Mg2+, Al3+, Ca2+, Na+, K+, and Mn2+) were recorded under the excitation of 500 nm. It is interesting
to note in Figure 5A,B that the luminescence intensity of the R-CDs is nearly 90%, quenched
by Fe3+ ions. However, approximately 30% of the fluorescence
intensity can be quenched by the same concentration of Cu2+ ions. In addition, when other metal ions are added to the aqueous
solution of R-CDs, there is no significant difference in fluorescence
intensity, which indicates that the R-CDs have good selectivity to
Fe3+ ions and can be used for the specific identification
of Fe3+ ions. Furthermore, various amino acid (l-Gly, l-Thr, l-Lys, l-Ser, l-Trp, l-Tyr, d-Phe, l-Phe, l-Asp, Hcy,
and GSH) interferences were investigated. As shown in Figure 5C,D, these interferents caused
little recovery of fluorescence, while the same concentration of l-Cys could recover about 4 times the initial fluorescence intensity,
indicating that the sensing platform has excellent sensitivity and
specificity. It is important to point out that the entire process
can be completed in a few minutes, and therefore, the sensing platform
is sensitive and efficient.

presence of various
metal ions, where F0 and F are the FL intensities of the R-CDs in the absence and presence
of various metal ions. FL emission intensity (C) and F/F0 (D) of the aqueous R-CDs and Fe3+ mixture in the presence of various amino acids, where F0 and F are the FL intensities
of the aqueous R-CDs and Fe3+ mixture in the absence and
presence of various amino acids.

2.5 Real Sample Detection
To evaluate
the potential practical value of R-CDs as recognition elements, different
concentrations of Fe3+ ions and l-Cys were added
to pretreated human serum samples to verify the method, respectively.
As shown in Table S1, the standard deviation
of human serum samples with different concentrations of Fe3+ ions was less than 2.32, and the recovery range was 98.60–103.8%. Table S2 shows that the relative standard deviation
of human serum samples spiked with l-Cys was less than 2.16
and the recovery was between 98.3 and 101%. The above results indicate
that the sensing platform shows excellent performance in actual sample
detection.

2.6 Cytotoxicity of R-CDs and
Fe3+ and l-Cys Sensing in Living Cells
Due to its excellent
FL behavior and fascinating stability, R-CD is an ideal candidate
for bioimaging. To test the characteristic cell cytotoxicity of the
R-CDs, we first carried out the standard 3-(4,5-dimethyldiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assays. The results (Figure 6A) showed that more than 90% of the cells
survived after 24 h of incubation with R-CDs at a concentration of
10–50 μg mL–1, which indicates that
R-CDs have no obvious cytotoxicity. So, we assessed the in vitro imaging
performance of R-CDs on Hep G2 cells. As shown in Figure S10, after incubation with R-CDs (20 μg mL–1) for 2 h, the shape of these cells were retained
and the Hep G2 cells could emit intense red fluorescence under 405
nm laser excitation. The above results indicate that R-CDs are endocytosed
into the cytoplasm due to excellent biocompatibility. What is more
interesting is that our previous switch-on design for detecting Fe3+ ions and l-Cys can also be implemented in the Hep
G2 cells. First, Hep G2 cells were incubated with R-CDs for 2 h. After
washing off the excess R-CDs, the confocal microscopy images were
captured immediately (Figure 6C(a,e)). Then, the concentration of 30 μM Fe3+ ion solution was added into the R-CD pretreated cells. After washing
the cells three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer
solution, confocal microscopy images were captured after fixing with
500 μL of PBS buffer. It is observed that the red fluorescence
was obviously quenched (Figure 6C(b,f)). Subsequently, we introduced 10 μM (Figure 6C(c,g)) and 50 μM
(Figure 6C(d,h)) of l-Cys in the same way and found that the fluorescence of R-CDs
in the cells gradually recovered. Figure 6B shows the normalized fluorescence intensity
captured at various stages of the process, indicating that the detection
system provides the possibility of visual monitoring of intracellular
Fe3+ ions and l-Cys, in view of the fact that
R-CDs can emit excitation-independent bright red fluorescence.

(50 μM) (d).

2.7 In Vivo
Imaging
To confirm that R-CDs
have good tissue penetration, in vivo nude mouse imagings were captured.
As shown in Figure S11, 100 μL of
R-CD aqueous solution was injected subcutaneously and the fluorescence
intensity at different emission wavelengths was captured under excitation
at 535 nm. It was found that bright fluorescence at the injection
site was observed at 600 nm (Figure 7). The mice injected with physiological saline were
used as controls. Therefore, dual-functional sensing platforms based
on good tissue-penetrating R-CDs have potential applications in in
vivo monitoring.

Figure 7 In vivo PL images of nude mice were injected subcutaneously
with
100 μL of saline and 100 μL of an aqueous solution of
R-CDs, respectively.

3 Conclusions
In summary, moderate quantum
yields of red luminescent carbon dots
codoped with sulfur and nitrogen were prepared by a facile hydrothermal
method using 2,5-diaminobenzenesulfonic acid as the unique carbon
source. R-CDs showed excitation-independent bright red fluorescence
and were successfully applied to cell imaging as well as in vivo imaging
in mice, indicating that the as-prepared R-CDs have excellent tissue
penetration and cell labeling ability. More interestingly, R-CDs can
be used to construct a dual-functional sensing platform for high-sensitivity
real-time detection of Fe3+ ions and l-Cys due
to the doping of nitrogen and sulfur to impart a rich functional group
on the surface of the R-CDs. The linear detection range of Fe3+ is 0–30 μM (LOD: 0.27 μM), and the detection
range of l-Cys is 0–24 μM (LOD: 0.14 μM).
The sensor platform was used to detect Fe3+ ions and l-Cys in human serum samples with satisfactory results. It is
worth mentioning that the switch-on fluorescence behavior for cell
imaging by reacting with Fe3+ ions and l-Cys,
respectively, has been investigated, which provides the possibility
of real-time monitoring in vivo.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
Reagent grades of 2,5-diaminobenzenesulfonic
acid was acquired from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Fetal bovine
serum, analytical grade 3-(4,5-dimethyldiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT), and Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM)
were also purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). All solutions
were prepared with deionized (DI) water from a Milli-Q-RO4 water purification
system (Millipore).

4.2 Instrumentation and Characterization
Excitation and emission spectra were recorded using a fluorescence
spectrophotometer (F-7000, Hitachi). Fluorescence imaging physical
photos were excited by an LED lamp at 450 nm (LUYOR-3260RB, Shanghai
LUYOR Instrument Co., Ltd). UV–vis absorption spectra were
recorded on an Avaspec-2048 UV–vis spectrophotometer. Powder
X-ray diffraction spectra (PXRD) was obtained on a PANalytical B.V.
(Netherlands) X’PERT PXRD. Fourier transform infrared spectra
(FT-IR) were measured on a Thermo FT-IR spectrophotometer. The images
of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were captured
on a JEM-2100 (JEOL, Japan) electron microscope operating at 200 kV.
X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were obtained on KRATOS XSAM800
X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Kratos Analytical Ltd, Manchester),
using Mg as the excitation source. Raman spectra were collected on
an Alpha300 WiTec Raman microscope (Witec Inc., Ulm, Germany). PL
lifetime and QYs were measured using FL3-111 (HORIBA Instruments).
The MTT assay was measured with a microplate reader (Spectra MAX 340,
Molecular Devices Co., Sunnyvale, CA). Confocal optical micrographs
were captured using a confocal laser scanning microscope (CarlZeiss
LSM710, Oberkochen, Germany). Fluorescence images were recorded using
an IVIS Spectrum CT small animal imaging system (Caliper Life Sciences,
Hopkinton, MA).

4.3 Synthesis of R-CDs
Precisely, 0.09
g of 2,5-diaminobenzenesulfonic acid was dissolved in 30 mL of DI
water and the solution was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon autoclave.
The autoclave was heated at 200 °C for 10 h and then naturally
cooled down to room temperature. Subsequently, the red-brown suspension
was centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 10 min to precipitate large
particles and the supernatant was dialyzed against a dialysis bag
(500 Da) for 24 h to remove the raw material. A reddish-brown powder
was obtained by freeze drying and was stored at 4 °C.

4.4 Quantum Yield (QY) Measurements
Measurement
was taken of the absolute QYs using a steady-state transient fluorescence
spectrometer (FL3-111). First, the optimum concentration was adjusted
according to the absorption intensity of the R-CD aqueous solution
at an excitation wavelength of 500 nm. Second, the solution was introduced
into a 1 cm fluorescence cuvette for QY measurement. Meanwhile, the
same fluorescence spectra of pure water were also obtained under the
same conditions. Finally, the QYs were calculated using fluorescence
software.

4.5 Detection of Fe3+ Ions and l-Cys
To achieve quantitative detection of Fe3+ ions, 100 μL of different concentrations of Fe3+ solution were added to 900 μL of R-CD solution. The fluorescence
intensity was measured with the same procedure as before to examine
the detection range of R-CDs for Fe3+ ions. The solutions
containing different metal ions (Ag+, Cu2+,
Pb2+, Fe3+, Fe2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Mg2+, Al3+, Ca2+, Na+, K+, and Mn2+) were prepared and then thoroughly mixed with
the R-CD solution. After standing for 30 s, the fluorescence intensity
of the mixed solution was measured by a fluorescence spectrophotometer
to examine the selectivity of the R-CDs to the metal ions. To detect l-Cys, 100 μL of different concentrations of l-Cys solution were added to 900 μL of R-CDs/Fe3+ mixture and the fluorescence intensity of the mixed system was recorded.
To evaluate the selectivity of the sensor for l-Cys, they
were replaced with different interfering agents under the same experimental
conditions. All samples were tested at an excitation wavelength of
500 nm and an emission wavelength of 593 nm.

4.6 MTT Assays
The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay was employed for the evaluation of cytotoxicity
of synthesized R-CDs. Hep G2 cells (5 × 104 cells
per well) were seeded in 96-well cultured plates and incubated for
24 h with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cells were then exposed
to different concentrations (0–50 μg mL–1) of R-CDs and further incubated for 24 h in the absence of DMEM.
The cells were washed with PBS solution and treated with 20 μL
of MTT solution for 4 h. Then, the insoluble precipitate of MTT (formazan)
was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. Finally, the optical absorbance
was detected at 570 nm.

4.7 In Vitro/Vivo Imaging
Cellular fluorescence
images were captured using an LSM710 laser scanning confocal microscope
at ambient temperature. In brief, 500 μL of Hep G2 cells (5
× 105 cells per mL) in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine
serum were seeded into 4-well culture plates and incubated at 37 °C
in a 5% CO2 incubator for 24 h. Subsequently, the culture
source was substituted with a mixture of the R-CDs (20 μg mL–1) in DMEM, followed by the incubation of Hep G2 cells
for 2 h. After removing the supernatant, Hep G2 cells were washed
three times with PBS buffer solution to remove the free R-CDs and
then fixed with 500 μL of PBS buffer.37

Fluorescence images of mice were captured at 600 nm using
an IVIS Spectrum CT small animal imaging system under an excitation
wavelength of 535 nm. In vivo imaging performance of R-CDs was observed
by subcutaneous injection of 100 μL (50 μg mL–1) of an aqueous solution of R-CDs in nude mice.
