This study represents
an expansion
of the application of catalysis in air through conventional coupling
and free radical processes. A reactive free aryl radical intermediate
was generated via the oxidation of an activated Ar–NH–NH2 bond by air as a simple and readily available oxidant. For
this purpose, the usability of phenylhydrazine and phenylhydrazine
hydrochloride salt reagents for the direct arylation of pyrrole with
aryl radicals was investigated. The facile coupling of N-methylpyrrole with aryl radicals was easily applied for the convenient
direct synthesis of C-2 arylated pyrroles without a transition-metal
catalyst.

Introduction
Found in many natural
products and used in many pharmaceutically
relevant and other functional synthesis,1 pyrrole ring is among the most important heterocyclic structural
units. 2-Arylpyrrole derivatives are examples of such pharmaceutically
and biologically active compounds; compound 1a exhibited
selective potent H+, K+-ATPase inhibition activity
as a potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB), compound 1b demonstrated potent inhibitory action for histamine-stimulated gastric
acid secretion in rats and Heidenhain pouch dogs,2 C-chlorfenapyr compound 2 was the first commercialized
insecticide-miticide,3 roseophilin 3 was isolated from a culture broth of Streptomyces
griseoviridis, which displayed cytotoxicity against
K562 erythroid leukemia and KB human epidermoid carcinoma cell lines,4 and compound 4 potently inhibited
cancer cell growth in the H146 small-cell lung cancer cell line, achieving
a nanomolar IC50 value.5 Furthermore,
trisubstituted pyrrole 5 displayed activity against both
erythrocytic and sporozoite parasite stages in vitro and in vivo,6 respectively (Figure 1).

containing 2-aryl-pyrrole
framework.

However, despite the numerous
applications of the arylated pyrroles,
their synthesis remains a challenge in organic chemistry because pyrroles
are very reactive and easily polymerize. Transition-metal-catalyzed
(especially Pd, Rh, and Ru complexes) cross-coupling reactions of
pyrroles are phenomenally successful for the formation of C sp2–sp2 bonds.7 Palladium
catalysts are the most important transition metals among others to
perform the arylation of pyrroles. Doucet and co-workers have reported
palladium-catalyzed regioselective arylation of pyrroles.8 Recently, a cheap and environmentally friendly
iron catalyst was developed.9 Despite numerous
applications of arylated pyrroles, there is deep need to develop a
new methodology because these transition-metals are very expensive
and rare metals.

In contrast, metal-free methodologies are rare
and challenging.
Very recently, considerable progress was made in the transition-metal-free
arylation of pyrroles. Gryko and co-workers reported both the direct
arylation of pyrroles with electron-withdrawing groups containing
aryl iodides in superbasic media without the external addition of
a transition-metal catalyst and the photocatalytic arylation with
diazonium salts catalyzed by a porphyrin.10 Yu and co-workers found that pyrroles could be directly arylated
with diarylidonium salts.11 Konig, Zhu,
and group independently reported the use of perylene
diimides as photocatalysts and mediators for the reduction of arylhalides
containing electron-withdrawing groups for the arylation of pyrroles
with aryl radicals via a photoinduced electron-transfer (PET) mechanism
and indirect electroreductive coupling.12 The aim of the present work is to a perform metal-free coupling
using pyrroles and arylhydrazine salts (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Direct Arylation of Pyrroles
Results and Discussion
Arylhydrazine salts have been
widely used for organic synthesis
because of their stability, high reactivity, and availability. These
compounds have been utilized for the Fischer indolization of various
carbonyl compounds13 and transition-metal-mediated
cross-coupling reactions.14 Recently, considerable
progress has been made in the transition-metal-catalyzed arylation
of inactive C–H bonds with arylhydrazine salts.15 However, new developments are needed for metal-free
arylations of inactive C–H bonds.

Arylhydrazine salts
can be transformed into aryl radicals via the
formation of instable diazene intermediates.16 In 2009, Wang and co-workers reported the arylation of [60] fullerene
for the synthesis of 1,4-fullerenols C60ArOH with arylhydrazine
salts in the absence of a transition-metal catalyst.17 Interestingly, in 2014, Heinrich and co-workers reported
the direct arylation of anilines with arylhydrazine salts in the absence
of a transition-metal catalyst.18 More
recently, Kuang and co-workers found that pyridines could be directly
arylated with arylhydrazine salts under metal-free conditions.19 In 2015, the Yadav group reported the direct
arylations of quinoline-4-ones, coumarins, and 2-pyridones with arylhydrazine
salts in the absence of transition-metal catalysts.20 Nevertheless, in these papers, only some unique pyrrole
substrates and arylhydrazine salts provided the desired cross-coupling
products in high yields under mild conditions. On the basis of these
findings, our paper reports the results of a novel method of transition-metal-free
direct C-2 arylation of pyrroles with arylhydrazine salts.

First, N-methylpyrrole and 4-chlorophenylhydrazine
hydrochloride salt were selected as the cross-coupling reagents to
optimize the reaction conditions in air, but no product was detected
until a base was added. Performing reactions of N-methylpyrrole (6) with 4-chlorophenylhydrazine hydrochloride
(7e) in a variety of polar and nonpolar solvents was
not successful. The pyrrole and phenylhydrazine salt ratio was tested
at very different ratios starting from 1:1. Some of these are shown
in Table 1. The best
yield and homogeneous medium for the reaction was determined to be
20: 1 for the pyrrole and phenylhydrazine salt ratio. Therefore, pyrrole
was used excessively. The cross coupling occurred in the presence
of a base at room temperature (rt) in air without solvent to form
the product. Because a long reaction time and low NaOH concentration
favor the arylation, our goal was to achieve a high yield. For this
reason, different from previous studies,18−20 the addition
of a lower NaOH concentration (0.5 M) and 50 h of reaction time increased
the yield. Notably, the functionalization of the pyrrole occurred
selectively at the C-2 position to give only one regioisomer of an
arylated pyrrole. The best yield (90%) for 8f was achieved
for the reaction with pyrrole as the solvent. The optimization of
the reaction conditions of pyrrole and 4-chlorophenylhydrazine hydrochloride
salt is summarized in Table 1.

a Reaction conditions:
entries 1-4:
pyrrole (0.1 mmol), 4-chlorophenylhydrazine hydrochloride (0.1 mmol),
base (0.5 M, 0.5 mL), solvent (1 mL), rt, 12 h, single-necked flask,
in air. Entry 5: pyrrole (0.1 mmol), 4-chlorophenylhydrazine hydrochloride
(0.1 mmol), rt, 12 h, single-necked flask, in air. Entries 6–16:
pyrrole (2 mL), 4-chlorophenylhydrazine hydrochloride (0.2 mmol),
inorganic base (0.5 M, 0.5 mL), organic base (0.01 mmol), rt, 50 h,
two-necked flask, in air.

Afterward, the influence of various bases in the cross coupling
was examined (Table 1, entries 5–16). Several of organic and inorganic bases were
screened, and only the use of NaOH and KOH (Table 1, entries 15–16) provided high-yielding
products (74–90%).

Unfortunately, the desired cross-coupling
product was not obtained
without addition of base or any other additives. After screening several
different bases and metal additives, 0.5 M NaOH was determined to
be the most efficient additive, providing a 90% yield of the desired
cross-coupling product under solvent-free conditions using the pyrrole
as both the solvent and reagent (entry 15). Further, solvent-free
reactions focused on the screening of different bases were also studied.

In each case, a single C-2 arylation product from the pyrrole
was isolated in excellent yield; neither N-arylation
nor C-2 and C-5 diarylation products were detected under the utilized
conditions (Table 1). The yields listed in Scheme 2 indicate that the phenylhydrazine hydrochloride salt,
with an electron-withdrawing substituent, can provide C-2 aryl products
with better results. Excellent yields of ≥70% were achieved
for the reactions involving chloro, bromo, and fluoro groups (entries 8e, 8f, and 8i, Scheme 2). The phenylhydrazine hydrochloride
salt containing an electron-withdrawing nitro group also gave a good
yield.16,17

Scheme 2 Reaction of Arylhydrazine Hydrochloride
Salts with N-Methylpyrrole
On the basis of the results of previous studies,18−20 a plausible
reaction mechanism for this reaction via the possible pathway is shown
(Scheme 3) after the formation
of the aryl radical from the phenylhydrazine salts in the presence
of the base and air. The desired arylated product was produced via
an initial electrophilic aryl radical reacting with pyrrole (6) to form an allyl radical (10), which was stabilized
by resonance (11) by O2 before losing an electron
and eliminating a proton to afford the C-2 arylated pyrrole (8).

Scheme 3 Plausible Mechanism
Conclusions
In conclusion, this paper reports the arylation
of N-methylpyrrole via a radical addition reaction
by air oxidation of
phenylhydrazine salts. This novel and convenient method for the arylation
of pyrrole offers several advantages, such as high regioselectivity,
operational simplicity, and mild reaction conditions, and utilizes
phenylhydrazine salts, pyrrole, NaOH, H2O, and air at room
temperature. This arylation protocol was used to prepare C-2 arylation
products of pyrrole and phenylhydrazine hydrochloride salt, reacting
near room temperature and providing easy product isolation.

Experimental
Section
General Procedure for C-2 Arylation of Pyrrole with Phenylhydrazine
Hydrochloride Salts
A two-necked 10 mL flask equipped with
a magnetic stir bar (2 × 7 mm2) was charged with pyrrole
(10 mmol, 670 mg) and phenylhydrazine hydrochloride salt (0.5 mmol,
72 mg). Aqueous sodium hydroxide (0.5 M, 0.5 mL) was then added dropwise
over a period of 0.5 h. The resulting mixture was stirred in a two-necked
flask at room temperature for 50–60 h without closing the necks.
The excess of pyrrole and water was evaporated at room temperature,
and the remaining solid was purified by flash column chromatography (EtOAc/25% hexane).
