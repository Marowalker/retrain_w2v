Diminazene, DMZ,
(or berenil) has been reported as a tight binder of G-quadruplexes. G-Quadruplex
structures are often located in the promotor regions of oncogenes
and may play a regulatory role in gene expression based on the stability
of the folding topology. In this study, attempts have been made to
characterize the specificity of DMZ binding toward multiple G-quadruplex
topologies or foldamers. Mutant sequences of the G-quadruplex forming
promotor regions of several oncogenes were designed to exhibit restricted
loop lengths and folding topologies. Circular dichroism was used to
confirm the quadruplex topology of mutant BCL2, KRAS, and c-MYC sequences,
human telomere (Na+ and K+) G-quadruplexes and
their complexes with DMZ and analogs thereof. Isothermal titration
calorimetry was used to generate a complete thermodynamic profile
(ΔG, ΔH, −TΔS) for the formation of DMZ and
analog complexes with the target G-quadruplexes. DMZ binds to parallel
and/or mixed parallel/antiparallel quadruplex DNA motifs with stoichiometries
up to 8:1 and via three binding modes with varying affinities. In
the case of the parallel G-quadruplexes, with the exception of the
long-looped c-MYC mutant, the highest affinity binding event (mode
1) is driven by enthalpy. DMZ binding to the long-looped c-MYC mutant
exhibits a very favorable entropy change in addition to a moderately
favorable enthalpy change. Mode 1 binding to the antiparallel and
mixed parallel/antiparallel hTel quadruplexes is also driven by favorable
enthalpy changes. In all cases, the intermediate DMZ affinity binding
(mode 2) is driven almost entirely by entropy, with small or unfavorable
enthalpic contributions. The weakest binding event (mode 3) is also
entropically driven with small or moderate enthalpic contributions.

Introduction
Both
DNA and RNA can form many secondary structures, such as G-quadruplex
(G4),1 triplex,2 i-motif,3 and a biological role for these
structures, especially G4s,4 has been suggested.
There are approximately 3.8 million guanine-rich regions in the human
genome, which have G4 forming potential,5 including those located near the telomeric6 and promoter regions of some cancer-related genes.4a

G4 motifs located in the promotor region of certain
genes must
be unfolded for transcription to occur as observed in oncogenes, including
c-MYC,7 KRAS,8 and BCL2.9 Small molecules that target
and stabilize these structures could have therapeutic value. Transcription
of oncogenes, including c-MYC,10 c-Kit,11 and KRAS,8 has been
down regulated via ligand-induced stabilization of the G4, and thus
these types of compounds may have a potential use as antineoplastics
in cancer lines with G4-related drivers.12 G4 stabilizing ligands, such as pyridostatin, Phen-DC3, and 12459,
have been shown to reduce the activity of a G4 unfolding enzyme by
stabilizing the G4.13 Due to the expected
important biological role the G4 motif has in modulating oncogene
expression, there is interest in identifying G4 selective ligands
for fundamental studies (for example, fluorescent ligands allowing
the study of G4s in vivo) and also druglike molecules that will allow
for selective targeting of G4s related to cancer14 and other diseases.15 Recently,
Marchetti et al. demonstrated the transcriptional down regulation
of genes in a human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma model connected
to survival, metastasis, and drug resistance.16 The authors rationally designed a G4-interactive ligand and used
global genome transcriptome profiling to identify targets of G4-binding
molecules in two pancreatic cancer cell lines (MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1).16 The lead compound CM03 exhibited mRNA down regulation
in cellulo for genes identified in the genome profiling and tumor
growth inhibition was observed in a pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
animal model.16

Efforts have been
underway to create high affinity and selective
G4 binders using several approaches, including the use of multicarbazole
scaffolds,17 metallopeptides,18 tetracyclic anthraquinone derivatives,19 and natural compound derivatives20 to name a few. G4-DNA has emerged as a potentially
relevant clinical target.21 Compounds that
selectively bind individual G4 present in promotor regions of oncogenes
may become useful for targeted treatments. Since individual G4 sequences
tend to fold into a major population, identifying compounds that selectively
stabilize individual topologies is an attractive prospect to target
G4 regulated genes. Mutant G4s with restricted folding topologies
limit the foldamers available by modulating the number and length
of G-repeats. The repurposing of drugs used in human and veterinary
medicine for anticancer therapies seems logical due to the potential
translational potential of such drugs or analogs since the molecules
are already in clinical use.22 The diminazene
(DMZ or berenil) scaffold was recently built upon to form alykyne-substituted
DMZ analogs as G4 binders.22 The lead DMZ
analogs were shown to be able to target c-MYC G4 both in vitro and
in cellulo and display reasonable anticancer activities (single-digit
micromolar GI50) against ovarian (OVCAR-3), prostate (PC-3),
and triple negative breast (MDA-MB-231) cancer cell lines.22

Along the lines of the previously reported
high affinity for several
quadruplex structures,23 the DMZ scaffold
is an attractive starting point to develop potent G4 ligands. Consequently,
we sought to revisit the characterization of DMZ binding to several
oncogene promotor G4-DNA mutants with restricted folding topologies.
In this work, DMZ binding was examined, and analogs were made by modifying
the amidine groups, cyclizing, and otherwise modifying the triazene
region of the DMZ scaffold.

Results and Discussion
Isothermal Titration Calorimetry
(ITC)
As is often
the case, the endpoints in ITC titrations with multiple overlapping
equilibria are difficult to determine with a high degree of certainty.
For this reason, we fixed the total ligand (DMZ analog) to G4 stoichiometry
at eight (8:1). This value for ntotal (8:1)
is consistent with the analytical data, e.g., the electrospray ionisation
mass spectrometry (ESI-MS)23 data as well
as the circular dichroism (CD) and ITC saturation endpoint data. Some
of the ITC thermograms required three equilibria to be fit within
experimental error, whereas a few only required two equilibria. The
nominal values of ni for the three equilibria
case were determined to be n1 = 0.25–0.5; n2 = 3.5–3.75; and n3 ≈ 4, whereas for the two equilibria case the values
of n1 and n2 were both nominally equal to 4. The distinction between the two
cases is whether the highest affinity binding process is described
by one or two independent binding events. Reducing the number of fitting
parameters from nine (K1, K2, K3, ΔH1, ΔH2, ΔH3, n1, n2, and n3) to six (K1, K2, K3, ΔH1, ΔH2, ΔH3) results in better fits without the loss
of important thermodynamic information (Table 1, Figure 1).

Mode 1
The change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) upon
complexation of DMZ to G4-DNA differed by only 1.45
kcal mol–1 and ranged from −11.75 kcal mol–1 (BCL2 3-6-2) to −10.3 kcal mol–1 (KRAS 6-4-6) for binding mode 1. Despite this small change in free
energy, the enthalpic term (ΔH) ranges from
−10.36 kcal mol–1 (hTel22 Na+)
to −2.08 kcal mol–1 (BCL2 3-5-3) for binding
mode 1, differing by 8.28 kcal mol–1. Entropic contributions
(−TΔS) range from −9.15
kcal mol–1 (BCL2 3-5-3) to −2.02 kcal mol–1 (KRAS 6-4-6) for binding mode 1, which is a difference
of 8.34 kcal mol–1.

Mode 2
The change
in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) upon complexation
of DMZ to G4-DNA ranges from −10.38
kcal mol–1 (hTel22 Na+) to −8.77
kcal mol–1 (KRAS 6-4-5) for binding mode 2, which
is a difference of 1.61 kcal mol–1. The enthalpy
change (ΔH) ranged from −0.43 kcal mol–1 (KRAS 6-4-6) to 0.18 kcal mol–1 (hTel22 Na+) for binding mode 2, which is a difference
of only 0.61 kcal mol–1. The entropy contribution
(−TΔS) ranges from
−10.56 kcal mol–1 (hTel22 Na+)
to −8.41 kcal mol–1 (KRAS 6-4-5) for binding
mode 2 yielding a difference of 2.15 kcal mol–1.

Mode 3
The change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) upon complexation of DMZ to G4-DNA ranges from −7.33
kcal mol–1 (hTel22 Na+) to −5.37
kcal mol–1 (KRAS 6-4-5) for binding mode 3, which
had a range of 1.97 kcal mol–1. Changes in enthalpy
(ΔH) range from −2.06 kcal mol–1 (BCL2 3-7-1) to −0.33 kcal mol–1 (hTel22
Na+) differing by 1.73 kcal mol–1 for
binding mode 3. The entropic contribution (−TΔS) ranges from −7.01 kcal mol–1 (hTel22 Na+) to −4.07 kcal mol–1 (KRAS 6-4-6) yielding a difference of 2.94 kcal mol–1 for binding mode 3.

Mixed parallel/antiparallel
G4-DNAs KRAS 6-4-4, KRAS 6-4-5, and BCL2 3-5-3 are driven by entropy
with favorable enthalpic contributions. The long-looped parallel c-MYC
1-6-1 G4-DNA also shares this thermodynamic signature.

Parallel
G4 BCL2 3-7-1 is driven primarily by enthalpy with a significant
entropic contribution. Parallel G4 BCL2 3-6-2 is driven by enthalpy
with a smaller, but favorable entropic contribution. The parallel
short-looped c-MYC 1-2-1 shared this thermodynamic signature of a
large enthalpic driving force with a smaller entropic contribution.

Mixed parallel/antiparallel G4-DNAs hTel22 (K+) and
KRAS 6-4-6 were driven by enthalpy with a smaller, but still favorable
entropic contribution.

Antiparallel G4-DNA hTel22 (Na+) was driven nearly entirely
by enthalpy with a favorable entropic contribution smaller than 1
kcal mol–1.

The ITC binding experiments with
several DNA foldamers, including
c-MYC, KRAS, and duplex DNAs, were attempted for the hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase (HSD) series of analogs, though weak interactions and
poor heat generation, even when utilizing reverse titrations, hindered
the determination of the binding thermodynamics for most ligands.
Forward titrations of HSD121 were able to generate preliminary binding
data for G4-DNAs c-MYC WT, c-MYC 1-6-1, KRAS 6-4-4, KRAS 5-4-5, and
25 bp duplex DNA. Other analogs in the series failed to generate meaningful
binding curves, even using high concentrations of G4-DNA in a reverse
titration experiment to circumvent the issues with ligand solubility.
The use of DMSO was necessary to obtain useable concentrations for
some of the DMZ analogs having lower solubility. Although we expected
DMSO to have an influence on the binding parameters, these were screening
experiments to determine if any of these compounds might have high
affinity for G4-DNA. We had previously determined that binding trends
observed in DMSO containing solutions having DMSO concentrations of
30% or less mimicked the relative affinities obtained in water for
compounds having adequate solubility. If lower solubility DMZ analogs
had been found that exhibited promising G4 affinity then we would
explore methods to improve their solubility. Table S1 summarizes the thermodynamic parameters that were determined
or an indication that the experiment was attempted. ITC thermograms
of these exploratory experiments are found in the Supporting Information
(Figures S8–S16).

CD
Parallel G4 c-MYC 1-6-1 demonstrates a slight increase
in molar ellipticity in the 265 nm region upon addition of DMZ as
seen in the CD data present in Figure 2. Parallel G4 c-MYC 1-2-1 demonstrates an attenuation
in molar ellipticity in excess of 4 mol ratios DMZ.

Parallel
quadruplex BCL2 3-6-2 and mixed parallel/antiparallel quadruplexes
BCL2 3-5-3, KRAS 6-4-4, and KRAS 6-4-6 resisted attenuation through
the course of titration with DMZ. Mixed parallel/antiparallel quadruplex
KRAS 6-4-5 demonstrated a slight attenuation in molar ellipticity,
which was more pronounced in the 260 nm region than in the 290 nm
region. Parallel quadruplex BCL2 3-7-1 demonstrated an attenuation
in molar ellipticity at the 4:1 mol ratio DMZ/DNA in the 265 nm region.

Antiparallel quadruplex hTel22 Na+ showed a slight attenuation
in molar ellipticity over the course of the titration by DMZ. Mixed
parallel/antiparallel quadruplex hTel22 K+ resisted attenuation
upon DMZ titration.

In most cases, the changes in CD signal
are very small. The most
important information that may be obtained from the CD data is that
the target DNA is initially folded into a G4, and the final G4-DNA·DMZ
complex is still folded into a G4.

BCL2 has been previously
characterized by NMR, and the major G4
species formed adopts a mixed parallel/antiparallel topology with
loop sizes 3, 7, and 1.24 More recently,
parallel BCL2 G4s with 13 member loops have been reported.25 In the mutants generated for this work, the
large loop bases have been mutated to adenine, which has different
stacking inclinations than guanine in single-stranded DNA (as in the
loops of a G4) and could be influencing the topologies characterized
in this work.26 The CD spectra for mutants
BCL2 3-6-2 and BCL2 3-7-1 clearly show that a parallel G4 population
is the major species present in solution, though the breadth of the
BCL2 3-6-2 curve and a slight signal in the BCL2 3-7-1 295 nm region
is suggestive of a minor antiparallel containing species.

Modeling
Docking of DMZ to a model of the c-MYC G4
core produced several poses, including docking to the exposed tetrad
face with the π-stacked network continued through the DMZ structure
via bonding with the aligned aromatic rings and guanines 10 and 15
of the 1XAV crystal.
H-Bonding interactions with the amidine groups were also observed,
and both types of interactions are seen in the ligand interactive diagram present in Figure 3. DMZ was also observed
to dock on the sides of the quadruplex, engaging in loop interactions,
as seen in Figure 4.

ITC
The free energy
for DMZ complexation with the G4s
examined in this work demonstrate similar free energies for each binding
mode (ΔG within ∼2 kcal mol–1 for each mode). The individual contributions of enthalpy and entropy
to each G4 mutant and binding mode varied by nearly ∼8.5 kcal
mol–1 across G4-DNAs. Clearly, enthalpy/entropy
compensation plays a role in maintaining an approximately constant
Gibbs free energy in the binding of DMZ to G4-DNAs of varied sequences,
lengths, and topologies.

c-MYC/DMZ Interactions
DMZ demonstrates
a slightly
stronger binding affinity for c-MYC 1-2-1 than c-MYC 1-6-1 (−11.37
and −10.77 kcal mol–1 respectively). The
binding profile of mode 1 differs greatly between each topology, with
the short-looped c-MYC 1-2-1 mutant complexation with DMZ being driven
by enthalpy (−8.38 kcal mol–1) and a smaller
(−2.97 kcal mol–1) entropic contribution.
Binding of DMZ to c-MYC 1-6-1 is entropically driven (−7.39
kcal mol–1) with a smaller enthalpic contribution
of (−3.38 kcal mol–1). Dehydration of the
large loop of c-MYC 1-6-1 as it folds to cover DMZ ligands bound on
the top face of the G-tetrad may account for the large entropic driving
force and additional bonding character in the enthalpic term from
the π-stacking interactions.

BCL2/DMZ Interactions
The thermodynamic signature describing
the binding of DMZ to BCL2 G4s presented a range of values from −2
to −9 kcal mol–1 for the enthalpic and entropic
contributions to free energy.

BCL2 3-6-2 demonstrated the largest
enthalpic contribution (ΔH = −8.77 kcal
mol–1) to the free energy (ΔG = −11.75 kcal mol–1) and the smallest entropic
contribution (−TΔS =
−2.98 kcal mol–1) for the mode 1 binding
event. This mode 1 binding event was the tightest observed for the
DNA construct examined in this study. The crystal structure of BCL2
(2F8U24) clearly shows a large loop covering
one of the tetrad faces, so modulating this loops size would likely
have a large impact on binding mode, as was observed in the ITC data
collected for this work. The loop size of BCL2 3-6-2 may be a good
fit for DMZ engaged in binding interaction directly in their vicinity.
Potentially, DMZ binding to an exposed tetrad face engages with a
loop to maximize constructive π-stacking. Restricted torsional
freedom upon ligand binding has been discussed before28 and it seem reasonable that the strong enthalpic binding
component should lead to a larger degree of restricted torsional freedom,
which leads to enthalpy/entropy compensation.

BCL2 3-7-1 demonstrated
an enthalpic contribution (ΔH) of −6.58
kcal mol–1 and an entropic
contribution (−TΔS)
of −4.78 kcal mol–1 resulting in the intermediate
affinity mode 1 binding event for the BCL2 mutants examined (ΔG = −11.35 kcal mol–1). This longer
second (7 base) loop likely provides space for DMZ to take advantage
of the π-stacking interactions with the G-tetrad but may be
too large for optimal contact. The one base loop may limit G4 relaxation
to maximize π-stacking interactions, resulting in the lower
enthalpic contribution observed. The larger entropic contribution
is likely due to interactions with the long loop which may displace
associated water molecules into bulk solvent.

BCL2 3-5-3 was
the weakest binder of the BCL2 mutants (ΔG =
−11.20 kcal mol–1) was driven
by entropy (−TΔS =
−9.15 kcal mol–1) with only a small enthalpic
contribution (ΔH = −2.08 kcal mol–1). This was a mixed parallel/antiparallel G4 as determined
by CD as opposed to the parallel G4 topology of the other BCL2 mutants.
The small enthalpic term suggest that the G-tetrads may be less exposed
than in the parallel mutants and interactions with the loops or sides
of the G4 could be more favorable. The 5 and 3 membered loops may
contribute to an overall poorer fit for making π-stacking contacts
with the DMZ, resulting in the large entropy term for water release
from desolvation of the DMZ/G4-DNA contact areas, but not extensive
specific bonding character. The mixed topology may result in the loop
not being able to fold onto the top of a G-tetrad as could be conceivable
with the parallel BCL2 mutants based on their large enthalpic contributions,
and may account for weaker enthalpic contributions for binding the
BCL2 3-5-3 G4. It is also noteworthy that the mode 2 free energy of
DMZ for BCL2 3-5-3 is approximately 0.5–1 kcal mol–1 weaker than the mode 2 free energy of BCL2 3-7-1 or BCL2 3-6-2,
though the thermodynamic signatures are largely the same.

KRAS/DMZ Interactions
KRAS 6-4-4 demonstrated the largest
free energy change (ΔG = −11.45 kcal
mol–1) upon DMZ binding of the KRAS mutants examined.
This complexation was driven by entropy (−TΔS = −7.16 kcal mol–1) with a sizable enthalpic contribution (ΔH = −4.30 kcal mol–1). This mutant likely
possesses good accessibility to the G-tetrad faces and favorable interactions
from the loops.

KRAS 6-4-6 showed the weakest binding mode 1
to DMZ with a free energy of −10.3 kcal mol–1. Interestingly, when compared to the other KRAS mutants, this mutant’s
first binding mode demonstrated the largest enthalpic contribution
(ΔH = −8.33 kcal mol–1) and the smallest entropic term (−TΔS = −2.02 kcal mol–1). Perhaps
the additional 6 membered loop is able to interact more favorably
with the DMZ than the 5 or 4 membered loops of the other KRAS foldamers
and better restrict the torsional freedom to reduce the favorable
entropic contribution as postulated with BCL2 3-6-2.

KRAS 6-4-5
has a smaller enthalpic contribution (ΔH =
−3.41 kcal mol–1) than KRAS
6-4-4 with a similar entropic contribution (−TΔS = −7.19 kcal mol–1) resulting in a free energy of ΔG = −10.60
kcal mol–1. The loss of nearly 1 kcal mol–1 from the enthalpy term due to the lengthening of the third loop
may be the result of a poorer fit if the loop bends to cover DMZ bound
to a tetrad face to generate π-bonding character. A DMZ molecule
may alternatively have less favorable interactions with the loop engaging
in binding interactions with the side of the G4.

hTel22/DMZ
Interactions
The antiparallel hTel22 Na+ G4 binds
only slightly weaker than the mixed parallel/antiparallel
hTel22 K+ G4 (ΔG = −11.2
vs −11.07 kcal mol–1) though the enthalpic
terms vary by nearly 2 kcal mol–1 (ΔH = −10.36 and −8.43 kcal mol–1 for hTel22 Na+ and hTel22 K+ respectively).
The entropic terms also vary by approximately 1.8 kcal mol–1 (−TΔS = −0.81
and −2.65 kcal mol–1 for hTel22 Na+ and hTel22 K+ respectively) The greater enthalpic driving
force of the antiparallel G4 hTel22 Na+ exhibited the most
favorable enthalpic contribution (ΔH = −10.36
kcal mol–1) and least favorable entropic contribution
(−TΔS = −0.81
kcal mol–1) of the oligonucleotides examined. This
purely antiparallel conformation possesses open top and bottom G-tetrads
for binding of DMZ and the loops are 3 nucleotide bases long which
potentially provides room for intercalation modes to be utilized.
The mixed parallel/antiparallel hTel22 K+ G4 has the open
G-tetrad face and a very favorable enthalpic contribution to binding,
but the larger entropic contribution of −2.65 kcal mol–1 is required for the foldamers to display a similar
binding affinity. This larger entropic contribution for the mixed
parallel/antiparallel species is likely a result of loop interactions
with the DMZ.

CD
To determine the structural effects of the interactions
between the DMZ and G4-DNAs, we performed a series of CD titration
experiments in which DMZ was added to the various G4s. CD titrations
were performed in the K+ tris buffer containing 30% DMSO.
Under these experimental conditions, the free c-MYC, KRAS, and BCL2
G4s exhibited characteristic CD spectral features that are similar
to those previously published in the literature.29 It is well known that putative G4 forming sequences typically
yield an ensemble of G4 isomers with different topologies. This is
the reason that we used mutant (e.g., 1-2-1 and 1-6-1) sequences with
restricted folded conformations. The use of CD in these studies was
(1) to confirm the existence of G4 motifs, (2) to determine any preference
DMZ compounds might have for a particular foldamer, and (3) to determine
if binding DMZ (or analogs) would perturb the folding equilibria in
the ensemble.

Upon complexation with DMZ, the CD signals for
c-MYC 1-2-1 and BCL2 3-7-1 dramatically attenuated. These G4-DNAs
demonstrate an attenuation in molar ellipticity in excess of 4 mol
ratios DMZ. This could be interpreted as consistent with 2 molecules
of DMZ binding to each exposed tetrad face (top and bottom) of the
G4 before a loop interactive mode is utilized, which may disrupt the
G4 motif structure. A plausible explanation for this is that the inherent
G-tetrad π–π stacking interactions are weakened
upon DMZ binding. Since both of these G4-DNAs have a loop containing
a single base, there may not be sufficient space for the G4 to relax
and allow the insertion of DMZ into the loops without the distortion
of the G4 core. The other mutant with single bases in loops, c-MYC
1-6-1 demonstrates a slight increase in molar ellipticity in the 265
nm region. This may result from an increased propensity for the extended
loop to fold over the tetrad in the presence of ligand.

The
G4-DNA hTel22 Na+ demonstrates a slight decrease
in molar ellipticity upon titration with DMZ. This is inconsistent
with the conservation of signal in the 290 nm region previously observed
as constant upon DMZ titration, but the buffer in this case has been
supplemented with DMSO and contain a higher salt concentration (previously
100 mM NaCl), which may explain the difference.23

The G4-DNA hTel22 K+ resisted a change
in molar ellipticity,
indicating that the structure was largely unchanged as a result of
DMZ binding.

KRAS 6-4-5 demonstrated an attenuation in molar
ellipticity, which
was more pronounced in the 260 nm region than in the 290 nm region.
This is consistent with a slight decrease in quadruplex structure,
possibly the result of a preferential perturbation of the parallel
G4 population.

The remaining G4s do not demonstrate attenuation.
It is possible
that the larger loop sizes provide flexibility such that DMZ binding
does not cause a deformation of the stacked G-tetrads and the π–π
binding network. The lateral loops may allow the G4 to relax and unwind
slightly to accommodate the DMZ.

There was no evidence for an
induce ligand CD signal when DMZ was
bound to the different G4s.

Representative CD experiments with
the analog series are shown
in Figures S5–S7 and generally show
only small changes in molar ellipticity, which are most likely the
result of small errors in the baseline or instrument drift. In fact,
DMSO results in such large disruption in the region below 240 nm,
that region has been removed from the CD figures. In effect, the large
DMSO signal in the shorter wavelength region precludes accurate measurement
of G4 ellipticities below about 250 nm. As with the DMZ titrations,
it seems the most important information that is obtained from the
CD spectra is that the target G4-DNA is present in the folded state
before and after the titration of the analogs.

Modeling
The stoichiometry of DMZ interacting with
a c-MYC G4 has been determined previously via ESI-MS to be eight DMZ
molecules per G4.23 The modeling data demonstrate
a rational for the reported binding, whereby two molecules of DMZ
may interact with both the top and bottom of the G4 and four DMZ molecules
interaction with the sides, for a total of eight.

An alternative
model for the binding would be the relaxation of the G4 as DMZ intercalated,
as has been a reported binding mode of TMPYP4.30Figure 3 demonstrates how the π-stacking network is not interrupted
by the binding of DMZ, and one may visualize 2 DMZ molecules oriented
between G-tetrads as able to line up with the guanine molecules and
engage the network. As many as four DMZ molecules would intercalate
into the G4 if this binding mode utilized with occupancy at the ends
as well, also for a total of eight. The relatively weak enthalpic
contributions of binding modes 2 and 3 for the G4s examined reveal
that entropy tends to be the driving force (see Figures S1–S3 for thermodynamic profiles). Though intercalation
would require a near complete stripping of water from the ligand,
which would result in a strong entropic contribution due to increased
torsional freedom of the solvent, it would be expected that π-stacking
interactions would result in very favorable enthalpic term, which
was not observed experimentally.

Conclusions
The
present work characterized the complexation of 1 antiparallel,
4 parallel, and 5 mixed parallel/antiparallel G4 forming oligonucleotides
forming complexes with DMZ. Though the free energy of the strongest
binding event varied by only ∼1.5 kcal mol–1 among the oligonucleotides examined, the thermodynamic profile varied
greatly, with the observation of enthalpy contributions ranging from
−10.36 to −2.08 kcal mol–1 (difference
of 8.28 kcal mol–1) and entropic contributions from
−9.15 to −0.81 kcal mol–1 (difference
of 8.34 kcal mol–1). Enthalpy/entropy compensation
is clearly a large factor in the binding of DMZ to G4 motifs, and
the selective modification of DMZ to improve either the entropic or
enthalpic binding character may lead to enhanced G4 selectivity.

Experimental
Section
ITC experiments were performed using a Microcal VP-ITC
(Malvern
Panalytical) at 25 °C in which a typical experiment involved
injection of 35 aliquots of dilute ligand (∼4000) μM
into the calorimeter cell containing 1.45 mL of ∼10 μM
DNA. Injection volumes were typically 8 μL, and injections were
made at 250 s intervals. The reverse titration was also utilized owing
to the low solubility of several ligands under examination. A typical
reverse titration experiment involved injecting aliquots of stock
0.6311 mM G4-DNA into the calorimeter cell containing 1.45 mL of 30
μM ligand. Reverse titration injection volumes were 2 μL,
and injections were made at 200 s intervals. The ITC thermograms were
corrected for titrate and titrant dilution effects by performing the
appropriate blank experiments and correcting the observed heats by
subtracting the heats of dilution. Data analysis was performed using
CHASM, an in house data analysis program developed by the Lewis Lab
to perform nonlinear regression fits of the corrected ITC data.31

CD experiments were performed using an
Olis DSM-20 spectropolarimeter
(Bogart, GA). Typical experiments involved the titration of a DNA
sample with a nominal A260 = 1.0 with
ligand sample at 25 °C. Corrections were made by subtracting
the signal of ligand titrated into buffer from its respective sample
and converting to molar ellipticity.

Computational analysis
of the c-MYC binding modes of DMZ was performed
using Maestro Version 11.3.016 by Schrodinger. PDB entry 1XAV(27) was imported into Maestro, and the “Protein Preparation
Wizard” was used to preprocess and minimize the structure using
the OPLS3 force field. The “SiteMap” utility was used
to identify potential binding sites, which were used as targets for
the Receptor Grid Generation tool to create grids to define potential
docking sites, and a grid was placed at the face of the G-tetrad.
Docking to the end of the c-MYC G4 core required truncation of the
DNA strand to remove residues covering the G-tetrad, which would be
inflexible during computational docking, but dynamic in solution.
DMZ was drawn using the internal build functions and subjected to
the “LigPrep” utility to prepare for docking. The “Ligand
Docking” tool was used at the XP (extra precision) level.

Materials
Target DNAs were c-MYC, KRAS, and BCL2 G4 forming mutants with
restricted folding topologies purchased from Midland Certified Reagent
Company. The G4 forming DNA was purchased as the RP grade and used
without further purification. The sequences are as follows: c-MYC
1-6-1: 5′-TGG GGA GGG TTT TTA GGG TGG GGA-3′; c-MYC
1-2-1: 5′-TTT TTA GGG TGG GGA GGG TGG GGA-3′; BCL2 3-7-1:
5′-CGG GCA CGG GAA AAA AAG GGC GGG AAC-3′; BCL2 3-6-2:
5′-CGG GCA CGG GAA AAA AGG GAC GGG AAC-3′; BCL2 3-5-3:
5′-CGG GCA CGG GAA AAA GGG AAC GGG AAC-3′; KRAS 6-4-4:
5′-GGG CAA TAT GGG AAA AGG GAA AAG GGA AAA-3′; KRAS
6-4-5: 5′-GGG CAA TAT GGG AAA AGG GAA AAA GGG AAA-3′;
KRAS 6-4-6: 5′-GGG CAA TAT GGG AAA AGG GAA AAA AGG GAA-3′
hTel22: 5′-AGG GTT AGG GTT AGG GTTA GGG-3′; 25 bp duplex
and its complementary strand: 5′-ACT TGC TCA CAG ACC GTA GCT
TGA T-3′ & 5′-ATC AAG CTA CGG TAT GTG AGC AAG T-3′,
respectively.

The DNA was exhaustively dialyzed against K+ tris buffer
(150 mM KCl, 20 mM tris, 1 mM EDTA, 30% DMSO, pH 7.2) (or Na+ tris buffer containing 150 mM NaCl in place of KCl for hTel22 Na+) and annealed by heating to 95 °C and holding for 10
min before cooling to 5 °C at a rate of 0.5 °C min–1. DNAs were likewise prepared in K+ acetate buffer (150
mM K+, 20 mM acetate, 1 mM EDTA, 30% DMSO, pH 5.0), which
was necessary to improve solubility of the DMZ analogs to a point
where their concentration would be sufficient for meaningful heat
generation in the ITC. DNA stock concentrations were verified using
the following extinction coefficients provided by Midland Certified
Reagent Company: c-MYC 1-6-1 ε260 = 270 300
μM–1 cm–1; c-MYC 1-2-1 ε260 = 270 300 μM–1 cm–1; BCL2 3-7-1 ε260 = 329 400 μM–1 cm–1; BCL2 3-6-2 ε260 = 329 400 μM–1 cm–1; BCL2 3-5-3 ε260 = 329 400 μM–1 cm–1; KRAS 6-4-4 ε260 = 393 200 μM–1 cm–1; KRAS 6-4-5 ε260 = 393 200 μM–1 cm–1; KRAS 6-4-6 ε260 = 393 200 μM–1 cm–1; hTel22 ε260 = 253 400 μM–1 cm–1; 25 bp duplex ε260 = 397 000
μM–1 cm–1.

DMZ was
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. and dissolved
in the final dialysate buffer using heat and sonication to assist
in dissolution. DMZ concentration was verified using an extinction
coefficient of ε370 = 36 700 μM–1 cm–1.

DMZ analog synthesis
is described in the Supporting Information. Concentrations were verified using experimentally
determined extinction coefficients. ITC experiments were performed
with the analog concentration below the experimentally determined
limit of solubility in each buffer system.
