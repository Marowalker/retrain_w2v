Serum antibodies that recognize carbohydrate
antigens play a fundamental
role in immune defense, homeostasis, and autoimmunity. In addition,
they serve as potential biomarkers for a variety of medical applications.
For most anti-glycan antibodies found in human serum, however, the
origins, regulation, and biological significance are not well understood.
Antibody subpopulations that are relevant to a particular biological
process or disease are often difficult to identify from the myriad
of anti-glycan antibodies present in human serum. While prior studies
have examined anti-glycan IgG and/or IgM repertoires, little is known
about IgA repertoires or how IgA, IgG, and IgM are related. In this
study, we describe the development of a multiplex assay to simultaneously
detect IgA, IgG, and IgM on a glycan microarray and its application
to studying anti-glycan repertoires in healthy subjects. The multiplex
glycan microarray assay revealed unique insights and systems-level
relationships that would be difficult to uncover using traditional
approaches. In particular, we found that anti-glycan IgA, IgG, and
IgM expression levels appear to be tightly regulated, coordinated
within individuals, and stable over time. Additionally, our results
help define natural fluctuations over time, which is critical for
identifying changes that are beyond normal biological variation.

Introduction
Human
serum contains a diverse collection of antibodies that play
important roles in human health and yield valuable insights into immune
function. Antibody profiling helps scientists understand how the immune
system responds to infections or diseases and identify antibody subpopulations
that can be used for diagnosing diseases or managing treatments. Additionally,
antibody profiling can be useful for the design and development of
vaccines by identifying new target antigens and determining what are
the favorable or detrimental immune responses to specific treatment.

Serum contains numerous antibodies that recognize carbohydrate
antigens, but this subset has been largely under studied relative
to antibodies that bind peptides and proteins.1−3 The dearth of
knowledge is not due to a lack of importance. Carbohydrate-binding
antibodies are involved in many immunological processes, such as tumor
surveillance, autoimmunity, allergy, and response to vaccines, and
they are useful for clinical diagnoses and detection. For example,
anti-glycan antibodies to blood group A and B antigens are relevant
for matching donors and recipients in blood transfusions and organ
transplants. Rather, the deficiency of information is due to the challenges
of profiling of anti-glycan antibodies, such as the lack of access
to glycans and poor throughput of traditional assays.

Glycan
microarrays provide a powerful, high-throughput tool to
profile serum antibody populations and identify specific subsets with
clinical or biological relevance. Many different carbohydrates are
immobilized on glass slides in a spatially defined arrangement, allowing
one to profile serum antibody levels for hundreds of glycans in a
single experiment while only using minimal amounts of clinical samples
and scarce carbohydrates. Glycan microarrays have been used in numerous
studies to profile glycan-binding serum antibodies (for some recent
examples, see refs;4−16 for a recent review, see ref (1)). These studies have primarily focused on either total
antibody levels or IgG levels to various glycans. IgM has been evaluated
in some studies, but very few studies have included IgA antibodies.
In most cases, researchers only evaluated a single antibody type per
experiment. Because each antibody type uses one array per serum sample,
the additional arrays required to evaluate multiple antibody isotypes
or subclasses becomes prohibitive. For example, in a recent study,
we analyzed serum antibodies in about 240 serum samples, with each
being tested in duplicate.16 To measure
one additional isotype or subclass, nearly 500 more array experiments
would have been required. For these reasons, little is known about
anti-glycan IgA repertoires or relationships between anti-glycan IgA,
IgG, and IgM antibodies. Furthermore, researchers may be missing important
responses from isotypes that are not being evaluated.

Multiplex
assays enable parallel analysis of multiple analytes
in a single experiment and provide numerous advantages. The ability
to profile multiple antibody isotypes in a single glycan microarray
experiment would provide many advantages over existing assays. In
addition to various practical benefits, such as generating more information
from fewer arrays and less reagents, a multiplex assay provides identical
assay conditions for each isotype leading to reduced variability relative
to measuring each in separate experiments. Simultaneous measurements
of IgA, IgG, and IgM would also improve our understanding of relationships
between isotypes and whether variations in anti-glycan IgA, IgG, and
IgM are coordinated or independent of each another. Lastly, the increase
in data would facilitate a better understanding of anti-glycan immunity
to infection, disease, and vaccines and a more rapid identification
of biomarkers.

Simultaneous detection of two isotypes or analytes
on a microarray
is well established. Multiplex assays for measuring three or more
isotypes/analytes on a microarray have been reported recently for
protein microarrays,17−19 but no such assays have been developed for measuring
IgA, IgG, and IgM using a glycan microarray. At the outset, it was
not clear if the same multiplex strategy would be suitable for glycan
microarrays, as serum anti-glycan antibodies have significant differences
in affinity, selectivity, and isotype usage relative to antibodies
that bind proteins. In addition, the reported multiplex assays for
protein arrays have some drawbacks. In prior studies of multiplex
assays on protein microarrays, fluorescence signals from the dyes
were detected in multiple laser channels, leading to differences in
signals for the multiplex versus singleplex assays. To account for
this bleed-through or “spillover” effect, one assay
used narrow band filters, resulting in lower sensitivity, and another
assay used multiple correction factors to adjust the signals, which
increases variability. Second, the studies provided limited validation
of the multiplex assays (i.e., testing with a single sample).

In this study, we describe the development and application of a
multiplex assay to simultaneously detect IgA, IgG, and IgM on a glycan
microarray. The development of the multiplex assay proved more challenging
than expected, and below we describe various issues that arose and
how we addressed those problems. Once the multiplex assay was optimized,
it was used to study IgA, IgG, and IgM repertoires in healthy subjects
over 4–12 weeks. The study enabled new insights into relationships
among anti-glycan IgA, IgG, and IgM as well as a better understanding
of natural biological variations of anti-glycan antibodies over time
within humans.

Results
Initial Planning
The first goal of this study was to
design and validate a multiplex assay to simultaneously profile three
antibody isotypes in human serum. The main criterion for a multiplex
assay is that the signals measured in the multiplex system are equivalent
to the signals measured for each individual assay. On the basis of
the published reports of bleed-through for multiplex microarray assays,
we selected our fluorophores and secondary reagents to minimize this
problem. Our microarray scanner has three lasers and corresponding
filters: a 488 nm laser with a 520/5 nm filter, a 532 nm laser with
a 572/34 nm filter, and a 635 nm laser with a 675/37 nm filter. We
anticipated that the largest amount of bleed-through would come from
the 488 nm dye being detected by the 532 nm laser. To minimize this
effect, we matched the 488 nm dye with the secondary reagent that
would detect the fewest and weakest signals, anti-IgA. IgM, which
typically has the strongest anti-glycan antibody signals in serum,
would be detected by the 635 nm laser. The 532 nm channel would then
be used to measure IgG signals.

Initial Results and IgA
Signal Loss
We initially tested
a pooled human serum sample (termed reference serum) using the following
commercially conjugated secondary antibodies: Alexa Fluor F488 anti-human
IgA, DyLight549 anti-human IgG, and Alexa Fluor 647 anti-human IgM.
Each isotype was run alone and in combination with the other secondary
antibodies to evaluate signal continuity between single and multiplex
wells. There were no measurable cross-over of IgG signals into the
635 nm channel, but some bleed-through of Alexa Fluor 488-labeled
IgA into the 532 nm channel was detected. Unfortunately, we ran into
an unexpected and more worrisome problem than the bleed-through—we
observed a significant reduction of IgA signal between the single
and multiplex wells for many array glycans. For example, the signals
for rhamnose and blood group B tetrasaccharide, which usually have
some of the largest IgA signals, were 128 109 and 98 197
RFUs alone but were reduced to 40 932 (68% signal loss) and
55 765 (44% loss), respectively, in the multiplex. The average
IgA signal loss was 40%, with 54 array components losing more than
50% of their singleplex IgA signal and 5 losing more than 75% of their
original IgA signal (see Supporting Information, Figure S2). The presence of 54 array components with decreases
of 50% or more was well beyond what one might expect from experimental
variability and particularly concerning as it would cause us to underestimate
the IgA serum antibodies and possibly miss significant changes. Signal
loss was most prevalent for array components with high IgA and IgG
signals.

We considered several possible explanations for the
reductions in IgA signals. First, serum IgA, IgG, and IgM molecules
can all bind simultaneously to a given array component. Therefore,
the various secondary reagents might compete for access to antibodies
bound to a given spot. If space is limited, the presence of anti-IgM
and/or anti-IgG secondary antibodies could potentially block access
of anti-IgA antibodies via steric hindrance. Alternatively, fluorophores
on the various secondary antibodies might interact, possibly leading
to quenching of fluorescence. For quenching to occur, the dyes would
need to have some spectral overlap (which is common between fluorophores
excited with 488 and 532 nm lasers) and be close enough on the array
surface for such energy transfer to occur. To distinguish these possibilities,
we switched the dyes attached to the anti-IgA and anti-IgM secondary
antibodies. In particular, we used Alexa Fluor 488-labeled anti-IgM
and Alexa Fluor 647-labeled anti-IgA. When we switched the fluorophores,
we found the signal loss to be specific to the 488 nm fluorophore,
supporting the quenching hypothesis rather than steric hindrance.

Strategies To Minimize Dye–Dye Interactions
One approach
for minimizing dye–dye interaction was to vary
the spectral properties of the dyes to minimize spectral overlap.
We tested several other dyes, but no improvements were obtained. An
alternative strategy is to reduce the number of fluorophores on each
secondary antibody. In principle, lower dye loading would decrease
the likelihood that two dyes would be in close enough proximity on
the array surface to interact. The commercially available Alexa Fluor
488 anti-IgA reagent had 6.9 fluorophores/antibody, and the commercially
available DyLight549 anti-IgG had 5 fluorophores/antibody. We performed
conjugation reactions to get ratios of 1.0 Alexa Fluor 488 per anti-IgA
and 1.5 Alexa Fluor 546 per anti-IgG; we also made a 4.9 Alexa Fluor
546 anti-IgG secondary antibody to use as a reference point, as there
is no commercially available secondary antibody with this dye. The
lower loaded dyes were then initially tested in a duplex assay detecting
IgA and IgG antibodies on the array and directly compared to the commercially
available dye-labeled secondary reagents. Decreasing the Alexa Fluor
546 loading on the anti-IgG from 4.9 to 1.5 produced about a 50% improvement
(a 50% decrease in the number of array components with signal loss
greater than 50%). Decreasing the Alexa Fluor 488 loading on the anti-IgA
reagent from 6.9 to 1.0 also provided about a 50% improvement. The
combination of low-loaded anti-IgG and low-loaded anti-IgA appeared
to eliminate IgA signal loss, at least in this duplex assay. We also
note that bleed-through with low-loaded dyes was negligible (see Supporting Information for more details).

Multiplex
Assay Validation
The goal of the following
experiments was to verify that our selected secondary reagents for
the multiplex platform would provide reliable data. We first tested
the standard reference serum at a 1:50 dilution using all three low
dye-loaded secondary reagents: Alexa Fluor 488 anti-human IgA (1.0
dye/antibody loading), Alexa Fluor 546 anti-human IgG (1.5 dye/antibody
loading), and CF633 anti-human IgM (2.2 dye/antibody loading). Each
experiment contained duplicate wells of each secondary antibody alone
and then all three together. With the low-loaded secondary antibodies,
only 8 components had IgA decreases of 50% or greater. Signal variations
of >50% for 8 array components out of 500 total array components
is
within expectations based on normal experimental variation for our
microarray data.20 When we graphed the
singleplex IgA signals versus the corresponding multiplex signals
for our low conjugated secondary antibodies, we observed a Pearson
correlation constant (R) of 0.98 and a slope of 0.99
indicating highly consistent results (see Supporting Information, Figure S3). The Pearson correlations and slopes
were equally good for the IgG and IgM singleplex data versus the multiplex
data (see Supporting Information, Figure
S3).

Next, we tested the multiplex assay with a more challenging
sample. Because IgA signal loss is primarily due to fluorophore–fluorophore
interactions between the Alexa Fluor 488 dye on the anti-IgA secondary
antibody and the Alexa Fluor 546 dye on the anti-IgG secondary antibody,
signal loss is most likely to occur in serum samples with very high
antibody levels. We have previously profiled serum samples from 220
healthy subjects on our array.16 We selected
a serum sample (#F50867-08) that had the highest anti-glycan antibody
signals from the cohort, thus placing it in the top 1% of all serum
samples found in healthy subjects. For the secondary antibodies with
standard dye loading, the singleplex versus multiplex IgA signals
had a correlation (R) of only 0.90, and 88 array
components lost more than 50% of their original IgA signal (see Supporting Information, Figure S4). As anticipated,
IgA signal loss was a major problem for this sample. Fortunately,
with the lower-loaded secondary antibodies, the singleplex and multiplex
signals had a correlation (R) of 0.98 and only 12
components lost more than 50% of their original IgA signal. Rhamnose
has especially high IgA and IgG signals for most individuals and is
one of the glycans that is most prone to IgA signal loss when comparing
the singleplex versus multiplex signals. For this serum sample, rhamnose
lost 68% of its signal using the secondary antibodies with standard
dye loading but only 3% with the low dye-loaded secondary antibodies.

Taken together, the results demonstrate that the use of low dye-loaded
secondary antibodies will provide substantially improved results and
consistent data between singleplex and multiplex assays for all but
the most extreme cases. Although fewer dyes per molecule of secondary
results in lower signals, we could easily increase the signals by
increasing the sensitivity setting on the array scanner. At our standard
working serum dilutions of 1:50 to 1:200, the multiplex assay should
provide reliable results for the vast majority of subjects.

Application
of the Multiplex Assay for Profiling Anti-glycan
IgA, IgG, and IgM Repertoires in Humans
While there have
been numerous studies profiling serum anti-glycan IgG and/or IgM on
glycan microarrays (for some recent examples, see refs;4−16 for a recent review, see ref (1)), much less is known about
serum anti-glycan IgA and the relationships between IgA, IgG, and
IgM repertoires. In addition, little is known about natural biological
variations in anti-glycan IgA repertoires over time and whether variations
in IgA are related to variations in IgG and/or IgM. To gain new insight,
we used the multiplex assay to profile antibody levels to 500 different
glycans and glycoproteins in serum samples taken from seven healthy
individuals collected at multiple time points over a 3-month period.

The antibody repertoires for each individual and each isotype are
illustrated in Figure 1. All three isotypes recognized similar glycan families. Examples
of families with high signals are non-human antigens, the blood group
A and B antigens, Lewis C and sialylated Lewis C, neutral glycolipids
(e.g. GA1, GA2, Gb3, Gb4, and Gb5), and peptides containing the clustered
Tn antigen. IgM antibodies recognized the greatest range of glycans
with the greatest signal.

Figure 1 Heat map comparing IgA, IgG, and IgM antibody
profiles. IgA, IgG,
and IgM profiles for seven subjects were evaluated on an array with
500 components using the multiplex assay. Data for each subject are
shown in rows. Data for each glycan/array component are shown in columns.
Signals (raw fluorescence units, RFU) are on log 2 scale. Glycans
are organized into families in the columns (several families are highlighted).
Black boxes indicate no measurable signal in our assay. Serum samples
are labeled with subject number and letter for the time point (e.g.
1a, 1b, and 1c are the three time points for subject 1). Subjects
are arranged in the same order for IgA, IgG, and IgM. SLeC is 3′sialyl
Lewis C; LeC is Lewis C; examples of non-human antigens include rhamnose,
α-Gal, and the Forssman antigen. Clustered Tn antigens are glycopeptides,
wherein there are two or more GalNAc-α-Ser/Thr residues. For
a full list of array components and descriptions, see Supporting Information.

For each isotype, we systematically compared antibody profiles
from person to person. A variety of genetic and environmental factors
can influence antibody repertoires. For example, age, blood type,
and vaccination history can all affect antibody populations in an
individual.16,20 Relationships were evaluated
by plotting signals for a given isotype in one person versus signals
for the same isotype in other people (e.g., IgA signals in subject
1 vs IgA signals in subject 2; for representative examples, see Figure 2A,C,E). All possible
permutations were evaluated, and the median Pearson correlation constants
were determined. For IgA, the median Pearson correlation constant
from person to person was 0.69. For IgG, the median Pearson correlation
constant from person to person was 0.68, and for IgM it was 0.73.
Therefore, each isotype demonstrated a significant correlation among
individuals.

Figure 2 Comparison of antibody signals for the same isotype. For
each isotype,
correlations were evaluated within the same subject at different time
points or from each subject to all other subjects. Representative
examples are shown. Signals for each glycan in subject 3 at week 0
were plotted vs subject 5 (A,C,E) or vs subject 3 at week 8 (B,D,F).
Antibody profiles from the same subject at different time points are
very highly correlated (r = 0.98–0.99). Signals
(RFU) are on log 2 scale. Isotype profiles from different subjects
have a significant correlation.

We also evaluated relationships between different isotypes
within
the same individual and among different individuals. IgA, IgG, and
IgM profiles were more consistent with each other within the same
individual than in different individuals. The profiles were visualized
and quantitated by plotting signals for one isotype versus another
isotype (e.g., scatterplot of IgA signals in subject 1 vs IgG signals
in subject 1; for representative examples, see Figure 3). Again, all possible permutations were
evaluated, and the median Pearson correlation constants were determined.
When comparing IgA profiles to IgG profiles in the same person, the
median Pearson correlation constant was 0.73 (see Table 1). When comparing IgA profiles
in one person to IgG profiles in different people, the median Pearson
correlation constant decreased to 0.56. Similar relationships were
observed when comparing IgA to IgM and IgG to IgM. For comparisons
of IgA profiles to IgM profiles, the median Pearson correlation constant
decreased from 0.72 within the same person to 0.62 among different
individuals. For IgG versus IgM comparisons, the median Pearson correlation
constant decreased from 0.57 to 0.51.

Figure 3 Comparison of antibody signals from one
isotype to another. Antibody
profiles for each isotype were compared to the other isotypes. Correlations
were evaluated within the same subject or across different subjects.
Representative examples are shown. For (A,C,E), data for one isotype
are compared to a different isotype in the same subject. For (B,D,F),
data for one isotype are compared to a different isotype in a different
subject. Signals (RFU) are on log 2 scale. Different isotypes are
more highly correlated in the same individual than among different
individuals.

Variations
in Human Anti-Glycan IgA, IgG, and IgM Repertoires
over Time
Microarrays are frequently used to identify antibody
changes resulting from treatment, infection, or other factors. Antibody
levels naturally vary over time and it is important to parse the natural
biological fluctuations from the changes directly associated with
a clinical treatment. We next evaluated variation over time for our
set of subjects.

IgA, IgG, and IgM repertoires were all very
consistent at different time points within the same person. The consistency
can be illustrated by plotting the signals for each glycan on the
array at one time point versus another time point for a given subject
(for representative examples, see Figure 2B,D,F). Across all the time points, subjects,
and isotypes, the median Pearson correlation constant (R) was 0.98, with the lowest R value being 0.96.
For each individual and isotype, we also calculated individual changes
in antibody levels over time for each glycan. For 4464 possible changes,
only 5.4% of IgA antibody changes were 2-fold or greater; 5.9 and
8.7% of IgG and IgM antibodies had changes greater than 2-fold as
well, respectively. Changes of 4-fold or greater occurred less than
1% of the time for all isotypes. For reference, 2-fold or greater
changes occur <3% of the time and 4-fold or greater changes occur
<0.006% of the time due to variability in the assay (based on replicate
experiments using the same serum sample). The changes were evenly
distributed among the array components, and there were no particular
glycan families that consistently demonstrated high variability.

Next, we determined how changes over time for one isotype related
to variations in the other isotypes within each individual. Fluctuations
from time point to time point within an individual were similar for
all three isotypes. For example, IgA levels to most glycans in subject
1 decreased from week 0 to week 7 (90% of changes were decreases;
see Figure 4). Likewise,
IgG and IgM levels to most glycans also decreased during this same
time period (80% of IgG changes were decreases; 72% of IgM changes
were decreases in subject 1). As a second example, IgA, IgG, and IgM
levels to most glycans decreased from week 0 to week 5 in subject
7 (82% of IgA changes, 92% of IgG changes, and 87% of IgM changes
were decreases). Thus, variations in IgA, IgG, and IgM levels to most
glycans appeared to be coordinated.

Figure 4 Heat map showing changes for representative
subjects. IgA, IgG,
and IgM signals were measured on the glycan microarray at different
time points. Changes from one time point to another were determined.
Representative data for subjects 1 and 7 are shown in the heat map
(data for other subjects can be found in the Supporting Information, Figure S5). White boxes indicate no change; orange
boxes indicate an increase; blue boxes indicate decreases. The scale
bar and coloring use a linear scale. Rows are labeled with the subject
number and the two time points. For example, “1: wk 0 vs 7”
refers to subject 1, changes from week 0 to week 7. Changes tend to
move in opposite directions at different time points, consistent with
a fluctuation about a steady state level. The vast majority of changes
shown here are less than 4-fold.

When assessing variations over multiple time points within
a given
individual, anti-glycan antibody profiles appeared to fluctuate about
a steady state. For example, IgA, IgG, and IgM levels mostly decreased
in subject 1 from week 0 to week 7 but then increased from week 7
to week 10 (see Figure 4). The Pearson correlation constants comparing changes from week
0 to 7 versus week 7 to 10 were −0.72 for IgA, −0.66
for IgG, and −0.58 for IgM. These data illustrate the high
degree of correlation and the inverse relationship between the changes
for the two time frames. The median change from week 0 to week 7 was
a 21% decrease, whereas the median change from week 7 to 10 was a
48% increase. These changes largely cancelled each other out, as the
median change from week 0 to week 10 was a 3% increase. As another
example, IgA, IgG, and IgM mostly decreased in subject 7 from week
0 to week 5, but they increased from week 5 to week 13. Also, we did
not observe any significant new IgA, IgG, or IgM populations during
this study, indicating that the set of anti-glycan antibodies present
in an individual is stable over weeks to months in healthy adults.

We previously profiled anti-glycan IgG and IgM antibodies present
in serum samples from 20 healthy individuals obtained yearly over
a 3-year time frame.15 To facilitate a
better understanding of our new results, we carried out additional
analyses on that data. Over this longer timer interval, anti-glycan
antibody profiles were very consistent but had a slightly higher level
of variability than over weeks to months. For example, IgG and IgM
changes of 4-fold or greater occurred about 4–5% of the time
over a 1–3 year time frame. Like the results above, both IgG
and IgM repertoires fluctuated about a steady state over a 3-year
time frame (for representative examples, see Figure 5).

Figure 5 Fluctuations in anti-glycan IgG and IgM over
3 years. IgG and IgM
signals were measured on the glycan array at time 0, 1, 2, and 3 years.
The array had 500 components. Changes at each time point relative
to time 0 were determined, and representative examples are shown for
two subjects. Signal difference (y-axis) is on a
log 2 scale. Anti-glycan antibody signals tend to fluctuate about
a steady state.

Discussion
In
the first stage of this study, we developed and validated a
multiplex assay to simultaneously measure IgA, IgG, and IgM antibodies
on a glycan microarray. Antibody binding on the array is detected
using fluorophore-labeled secondary antibodies specific for each isotype.
For the multiplex assay, we used three different laser/dye pairs to
detect different isotypes: a 488 nm laser/dye pair to detect IgA,
a 532 nm laser/dye pair to detect IgG, and a 635 nm laser/dye pair
to detect IgM. Unfortunately, our initial investigations using commercially
available secondary reagents resulted in significant loss of IgA signals
in the multiplex relative to the singleplex assay. For example, 54
components lost greater than 50% of their IgA signal when multiplexed,
and 5 components lost greater than 75% of their IgA signal. If we
only consider array components with measurable IgA signals, roughly
one-third of that group lost more than 50% of their signal.

Several lines of evidence indicated that the loss of IgA signal
was due to dye–dye interactions (e.g., quenching) between the
488 nm fluorophore conjugated to the anti-IgA secondary reagent and
the 532 nm fluorophore conjugated to the anti-IgG reagent. First,
the 488 nm fluorophore and 532 nm fluorophore have some spectral overlap
which would allow interaction. Second, loss of IgA signal was largest
for array components where IgA and IgG had high signals, situations
where dyes are more likely to be in close proximity. Third, when we
switched the dyes on the secondary reagents used to detect IgA and
IgM, we no longer observed loss of IgA signal in the multiplex and
we then observed loss of IgM signals.

We evaluated a variety
of approaches for addressing the loss of
signal. The most fruitful strategy involved decreasing the number
of dye molecules attached to each secondary antibody molecule to reduce
the number of dyes that are in close enough proximity on the array
surface to suffer from dye–dye quenching. Fortunately, this
approach led to major improvements. For example, use of low dye-loaded
secondary reagents decreased the number of components that lost greater
than 50% of their IgA signal in the multiplex from 54 to just 8. This
approach was validated with multiple serum samples and was found to
be effective even for samples with very high anti-glycan antibody
levels.

The multiplex assay has several advantages over prior
glycan microarray
assays for profiling serum antibodies. First, it allows faster acquisition
of data while using fewer microarrays and reagents than a single or
duplex assay. For example, the longitudinal study carried out in this
study required 32 arrays using the multiplex assay, whereas 96 arrays
would have been required if each isotype was run individually. Second,
the multiplex provides better comparisons among isotypes for a given
patient. Because all three isotypes are assayed at the same time using
identical experimental conditions and the same array, variability
is minimized. Lastly, the multiplex requires less serum for each subject
or patient, which can be in very limited supply for many clinical
studies.

Although multiplex assays have been reported previously
for protein
microarrays, our study provides new insights and approaches. In particular,
our study highlights signal loss due to fluorophore–fluorophore
interactions as a key problem. While prior studies have discussed
potential signal loss, the methods and analyses may not have been
optimal for detecting this problem. Prior studies have focused on
plotting singleplex data versus multiplex data and evaluating Pearson
correlation constants. Because fluorophore–fluorophore quenching
only affects a subset of signals and there is a large amount of other
data, effects on the Pearson correlation constants can be modest.
For example, Taghavian et al. state that signal loss was not a problem
in their assay based on good Pearson correlation constants; however,
the data show a variety of multiplex IgA signals that are lower than
expected and the slopes of the lines were lower than 1.0 (y = 0.84), indicating an overall trend of lower than expected
signals for the multiplex assay.19

We used a combination of approaches to evaluate singleplex versus
multiplex data, including determining Pearson correlation constants,
evaluating trendline slopes, and counting the number of signals that
decrease 50% or more. In addition, we identified types of serum samples
that are especially prone to signal loss, that is, samples with high
IgG and IgA signals, where fluorophore–fluorophore interactions
are more likely to occur. By using a more sensitive approach for analysis
and testing the assay with a “difficult” serum sample,
we are better able to detect problems and determine if our assay is
suitable. From these insights, we were able to develop a solution
for minimizing signal loss: using low dye-loaded secondary reagents.
The approaches for detecting signal loss and the strategy for overcoming
the problem could be applicable to multiplex assays on protein microarrays
as well.

In the second phase of the study, we applied the multiplex
assay
to study anti-glycan IgA, IgG, and IgM repertoires in healthy human
subjects. The study included serum collected at an initial time point
as well as serum collected from the same subjects at additional times
over several weeks to a few months. Many other studies have reported
information about anti-glycan IgG and/or IgM repertoires or combined
IgA/IgG/IgM repertoires (for some recent examples, see refs;4−16 for a recent review, see ref (1)). Very few studies have
evaluated anti-glycan IgA, and these studies profiled IgA on small
arrays, evaluated very few serum samples, and/or did not evaluate
any other isotypes.10,11,21−24 Consequently, little is known about serum anti-glycan IgA or about
relationships between anti-glycan IgA and other isotypes. Additionally,
biological variation over time for anti-glycan IgA or whether those
variations are related to IgG and/or IgM variations over time have
not been evaluated.

Our study provides several key insights.
First, in a textbook antibody
response, IgM antibodies are formed within a few days after exposure
to an antigen. After 1–2 weeks, IgM antibodies decrease and
IgG antibodies are produced. The IgM response can be short-lived,
whereas IgG responses can be long lasting. From this classical model,
one might expect IgM antibody repertoires to be dynamic and variable,
while IgG repertoires are more stable. We found that anti-glycan IgA,
IgG, and IgM repertoires are all highly stable within an individual
over time. When comparing antibody profiles within an individual over
weeks to months, Pearson correlation constants were typically 0.99.
Moreover, changes of 4-fold or greater occurred less than 1% of the
time, and over 1–3 years changes of 4-fold or greater occurred
less than 5% of the time, even for IgM. The changes that did occur
would be best described as fluctuations about a steady state, rather
than changes resulting from a dynamic repertoire, wherein new subpopulations
of anti-glycan antibodies continually develop while other subpopulations
disappear. Therefore, our results demonstrate that anti-glycan IgA,
IgG, and IgM repertoires are stable and tightly regulated within an
individual over time. Stable expression of an antibody population
throughout life is a common feature of “natural antibodies”,
or antibodies derived from B1 cells.25 Therefore,
many of the anti-glycan antibodies that we are detecting, especially
the IgM, may be natural antibodies.

The datasets that we report
and the information about variability
are especially useful for identifying biomarkers and anti-glycan antibody
responses that are relevant to biology and medicine. To identify changes
induced by vaccination, infection, or disease, one must first understand
and define the natural biological variations over time in healthy
subjects. Our results provide a baseline for identifying changes induced
by treatment or disease that are beyond what one would expect from
natural fluctuations over time. In addition, our studies provide insight
into how that threshold might change based on the time frame of the
study. For a study looking at changes over weeks to months, a threshold
of 2- to 3-fold might be sufficient, as changes of this magnitude
occur only rarely due to natural variations over this time period.
For a study evaluating changes over longer time periods (e.g., years),
a threshold of 4-fold or great might be better.

Our study also
indicates that anti-glycan IgA repertoires are highly
correlated with IgG and IgM repertoires within an individual. At a
given time point, the median Pearson correlations between isotypes
were 0.73 (IgA vs IgG), 0.72 (IgA vs IgM), and 0.57 (IgG vs IgM).
The most highly correlated repertoires were IgA and IgG in subject
7, with a Pearson correlation of 0.83. Correlations were higher within
the same individual than among different subjects. Changes in IgA,
IgG, and IgM were also correlated. Taken together, these results suggest
that the generation of anti-glycan IgA, IgG, and IgM repertoires may
be coordinated and that expression levels are co-regulated within
an individual.

Several limitations of our study should be noted.
First, our array
contains hundreds of glycans and glycopeptides; however, there are
numerous other glycans that are not represented. For example, we have
little representation of glycosaminoglycans and microbial polysaccharides.
Therefore, our observations and conclusions may or may not apply to
antibodies that are not detected on our array. Second, the study included
a limited number of subjects, and all subjects were healthy. Larger
studies and evaluation of individuals with various diseases or other
conditions will be needed to further evaluate our findings.

Overall, our study highlights the advantages of combining the multiplex
assay with glycan microarray technology for studying and understanding
immune recognition of glycans. The ability to simultaneously profile
IgA, IgG, and IgM antibodies to approximately 500 glycans and glycopeptides
on the array revealed unique insights and systems-level relationships
that would be difficult to uncover using traditional approaches and
assays. This combination will be especially useful for identifying
anti-glycan antibody subpopulations relevant to vaccine development,
immunity to pathogens, autoimmunity, allergy, and diseases.

Materials
and Methods
Secondary Antibodies
A table of secondary antibodies
and dyes evaluated in this study can be found in the Supporting Information (Table S1). The final secondary antibodies
used for the multiplex assay were as follows. Alexa Fluor 488 Antibody
Labeling Kit (Thermo Fisher, A-20181) was used to label the unconjugated
goat anti-human IgA antibody (Jackson Immuno 109.005.011, 1.5 mg/mL).
The Alexa Fluor 546 Antibody Labeling Kit (Thermo Fisher, A-20183)
was used to label the goat anti-human IgG secondary antibody (Jackson
Immuno 109.005.098, 1.5 mg/mL). CF633 succinimidyl ester dye (Sigma-Aldrich;
SCJ4600039) was used to label the goat anti-human IgM antibody (Jackson
Immuno, 109.005.129). The degree of labeling was determined using
the spectral properties of the dye following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Additional experimental details can be found in the Supporting Information.

Serum Samples
The F58067-08 sample used for testing
and multiplex validation was from Valley Biomedical Products and Services
(Winchester, VA). The reference serum was pooled from 10 samples purchased
from Valley Biomedical Products and Services. Sera used for the longitudinal
study were obtained from seven healthy adult male donors through the
Research Donor Program at the National Institutes of Health Clinical
Center, Department of Transfusion Medicine (for additional information
see Supporting Information, Table S2).
Samples were tested in accordance with FDA regulations and found to
be negative for HIV 1/2 AB, HCV AB, and nonreactive for HBSAG, HIV-1
RNA, HCV RNA, and STS. All samples were obtained in serum separator
tubes, processed within 4 h of blood collection, and stored at −80
°C until assayed. All samples had been thawed and refrozen at
least once but not more than 3 times. In prior work, we have found
that up to 3 freeze–thaw cycles have no effect on anti-glycan
antibody profiles.26

Glycan Microarray
Fabrication
Glycans and glycopeptides
used for microarrays were conjugated to either bovine serum albumin
(BSA) or human serum albumin (HSA) to produce neoglycoproteins that
approximate the density of spacing of natural glycoproteins.27 Some glycans were conjugated at high and low
densities, as denoted by the number following the array component
name. The array platform, printing, and assay have been described
previously,28 along with analysis of reproducibility20 and validation with numerous antibodies and
lectins.29−33 Array printing was done on a MicroGrid II arrayer (Biorobotics)
by SMP2 pins (Arrayit). Neoglycoproteins were printed at 125 μg/mL
and glycoproteins were printed at 200 μg/mL in duplicate on
epoxy-coated slides (SME2, Arrayit); for a full list of the 500 array
components, see Supporting Information.
Atto555 azide dye (Thermo Scientific) at 0.7 μg/mL was mixed
in the print buffer to evaluate print quality prior to performing
experimental assays. The soluble dye is washed away before each experiment.
Each slide contained 16 identical wells with an average spot size
of 80 μm. Representative slides from each print batch were assessed
for quality and reproducibility using a standard set of lectins [ConA
(Man-binding lectin) and WGA (GlcNAc-binding lectin) from Vector Laboratories;
HPA (GalNAc-binding lectin) from Sigma-Aldrich] and monoclonal antibodies
[CLCP-19B (blood group B-binding antibody; BioLegend) and T36 (blood
group A-binding antibody; Genetex)]. The slides were stored in vacuum-sealed
boxes at −20 °C until use.

High-Throughput Profiling
of Serum Anti-glycan IgA, IgG, and
IgM Antibodies
Prior to each experiment, each microarray
slide was scanned in an InnoScan 1100 AL fluorescence scanner to check
for any defects and missing print spots. The slides were placed in
16-well modules using metal clips (Grace Bio-Labs) to separate the
16 identical arrays and allow for different experimental conditions.
The array slides were blocked overnight at 4 °C in 3% BSA, phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) (200 μL/well) and then washed six times
with PBS buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.05% Tween-20 (PBST). Human sera
were diluted 1:25 or 1:50 in 3% BSA and 1% HSA in PBST and added to
assigned wells on the slide (100 μL/well). All serum samples
were measured in duplicate wells printed by different pins in order
to minimize pin and slide variations. All samples from a given subject
were assayed on the same day to minimize day-to-day assay variation.
To help detect potential experimental variability, we include a variety
of controls on the array, such as printed human IgA, IgG, and IgM
spots, unmodified BSA and HSA, and printed dyes. After incubating
for 4 h at 37 °C with gentle agitation (100 rpm), the slides
were washed six times in PBST (200 μL/well). To detect bound
serum antibodies, secondary antibodies were diluted 1:500 in 3% HSA
and 1% BSA PBS and added to the slide (100 μL/well). Slides
were covered with aluminum foil to prevent photobleaching and then
incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with gentle agitation. Following six
washes with PBST, slides were removed from the module and soaked in
PBST for 5 min prior to being dried in a centrifuge at 1000 rpm for
5 min.

Image Analysis and Data Processing
The arrays were
scanned at 5 μm pixel resolution with an InnoScan 1100 AL fluorescence
scanner. The photomultiplier tube (PMT) settings were the same for
all experiments to limit unintentional signal variation. Slides were
scanned at “high” and “low” PMT settings
(for the 488 nm laser, high pmt = 100 and low pmt = 55; for the 532
nm laser, high pmt = 20 and low = 5; for the 635 nm laser, high =
9 and low = 4) to increase the dynamic range and appropriately scale-saturated
components. Spots were defined as circular features with diameter
60–80 μm, and fluorescence intensity for each component
was quantified with GenePix 7.0 software (Molecular Probes). The GenePix
array file was manually adjusted for each spot to reflect their actual
sizes and placements. Any features marked as missing or defective
in the prescan were excluded from further analysis. The local background
corrected median was used for data analysis, and spots with intensity
lower than 150 RFU (1/2 the typical IgM background) were set to 150.
The signals for replicate spots on duplicate wells were averaged and
log-transformed (base 2) for future analysis. Representative images
of array data (prescans and post-assay scans) can be found in the Supporting Information (see Figure S1).
