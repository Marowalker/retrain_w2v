Nitrogen is one of
the most common heteroatom appearing in heterocyclic
aromatic compounds (HACs) as well as the frequently applied dopant
in graphene nanoflakes/nanoribbons. The pyridine moiety is an intuitive
and stable common feature of these compounds; but interestingly, using
density functional theory calculations, we found that the N-hydrogenated
pyridine moiety could be even more stable in large HACs and in N-doped
graphene nanoflakes considering their formation reaction energies.
The hydrogenation reaction of the pyridine moiety was calculated to
be exothermic for models of four and more fused aromatic rings with
specific substitutional positions of nitrogen. This theoretical investigation
provides energetic and spectroscopic hints to the existence of the
N-hydrogenated pyridine moiety under proper conditions.

1 Introduction
Heterocyclic
aromatic compounds (HACs) have been well known to
chemists for 100 years and used as laboratory reagents, industrial
materials, biological metabolites, environmental pollutants, etc.
in our daily life. Nitrogen is one of the major heteroatoms that substitute
aromatic carbon in these compounds. Starting from the simplest six-membered
ring aromatic hydrocarbon and stepping toward fused-ring polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a single nitrogen substitution results
in pyridine (C5H5N) from benzene, quinoline,
and isoquinoline (C9H7N) from naphthalene, acridine,
and benzoquinoline (C13H9N) from anthracene,
and so on. In these quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) HACs, one nitrogen
atom replaces one C–H unit, forming the pyridine-type moiety
where one electron in the perpendicular 2p orbital of nitrogen is
incorporated into the π-conjugated electronic system, and one
set of lone-pair electrons fills the in-plane sp2 nonbonding
orbital outside the aromatic structure. Such an arrangement satisfies
Hückel’s 4n + 2 rule of π-electrons
and thus retains the aromaticity.1,2

What
interests us is the role of the lone pair, which seems outsider
of the system. It can play as a Lewis base and form a coordinate covalent
bond to a Lewis acid, e.g., proton. This N-protonated pyridine moiety
is also well known; the N–H+ σ bond is basically
irrelevant to aromaticity. But what will happen, or could it happen,
if nitrogen bonds with “hydrogen atom” instead of proton?
Supposing it takes place, not only the N–H bond is formed but
also one extra electron is injected into the compound. The extra electron
is supposed to reside on the π* antibonding orbital, yielding
a total number of 4n + 3 electrons, deteriorating
the aromaticity, raising the total energy, and making the system unstable.

We temporarily switch to HAC anions with 4n +
3 electrons, which meet a similar one-extra-electron situation (but
without the extra hydrogen). Early experiments showed that pyridine
anion (C5H5N–) is unstable,
readily getting dimerized or oxidized after formation.3 Quinoline anion (C9H7N–) has a longer lifetime in the sub-ms range,4 and, interestingly, quinoline itself has a small but noticeable
electron affinity.5 From the theoretical
point of view, it is an intuitive scenario that an extra electron
residing in the π* orbital, turning the original lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) to singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO),
will decrease the stability of the HAC based on the simple Hückel’s
theory. However, this scenario may be altered by several factors.
First, elongating or enlarging the HAC with more fused rings will
lower the original LUMO energy level. Second, counting in electron
correlation (i.e., beyond Hückel’s theory) will further
lower the SOMO energy. Moreover, in the case of N-hydrogenated HAC,
the formation of N–H bond would also contribute to the overall
stability of the system.

Whereas a pyridine anion or an N-hydrogenated
pyridine requires
harsh generation conditions like electron beam irradiation or strong
reducing reagent,3,6,7 a
stable N-hydrogenated pyridinic HAC could be possible considering
the above factors. Although this species has not been reported experimentally,
it has been proposed in theoretical studies of X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS)8 and electrochemical
oxygen reduction reactions.9−11 We shall further explore these
N-hydrogenated pyridinic HACs by using density functional theory (DFT)
calculations in this work. Calculations on the formation reaction
energies and stability as well as analyses on frontier MOs and excitation
configurations of small nitrogen-contained quasi-1D HACs and graphene
nanoflakes (nanoribbon fragments) are given in the following sections.

2 Computational Methods
A “bottom-up” approach
of increasing building blocks
(aromatic rings) to construct model clusters was adopted. Quasi-1D
PAH[n,1] model molecules (following Nakano’s
notation)12,13 were first constructed with n fused six-membered rings along the zigzag direction and one carbon
atom on the edge position was replaced by nitrogen to generate N-hydrogenated
pyridinic HACs. The normal pyridine-type HACs were also obtained by
removing the hydrogen attached on nitrogen. Whereas the N-hydrogenated
HACs were neutral radicals with doublet ground states, the quasi-1D
pyridine-type ones were neutral closed-shell singlets. All these model
compounds were geometrically optimized by DFT calculations, and their
excitation configurations and UV–vis absorption spectra were
simulated by time-dependent (TD) DFT. The calculations adopted the
B3LYP functional and the 6-31G(d) basis set, which
have been shown to be adequate in previous studies.14,15 The ground-state vibrational frequencies were scaled by a factor
of 0.960,16 and peaks in vibrational spectra
were broadened with a half-width at half-maximum (HWHM) of 5 cm–1. The UV–vis absorption spectrum of each model
counted 50 excited states, and peaks were broadened with HWHM of 0.025
eV (200 cm–1). It was noticed that for open-shell/doublet
systems, the spin contamination occurred in TD-DFT calculations,17,18 and we have set threshold criteria to rule out unphysical excited
states by considering the change of square of total spin, Δ⟨Ŝ2⟩, and the participation of SOMO
upon excitation.15 Calculations using other
functionals including CAM-B3LYP, M06HF, and ωB97X-D were also
carried out to verify the consistency of the DFT results.

The
N-doped graphene nanoflake models were constructed accordingly
with [n,m] fused-ring arrays where m denotes the number of rows along the armchair direction.
It has been found that nitrogen substitution tends to occur on edge
positions rather than inside the ribbon/flake according to calculated
total energies.15 The N-hydrogenated graphene
nanoflakes were also neutral radicals with doublet ground states.
On the other hand, most of the pyridine-type models, unlike the quasi-1D
HAC cases, possessed open-shell singlet (oss) characteristics, where
frontier MOs distribute on both zigzag edges.12,19−21 Sample geometric structures of these HACs are illustrated
in Figure 1, with the
numbering of possible substitutional positions noted. We have applied
the HuLiS calculator22,23 for simple Hückel MO analysis,
and the Gaussian 09 package24 for all detailed
calculations.

of substitutional
positions. (a) HAC[5,1]NH@3a, one quasi-1D HAC of five fused rings

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Formation
Energy and Stability
Considering
the single-nitrogen substitution reaction that converts PAH to HAC, 1a   1b  where eq 1a refers to
the formation of simple pyridine moiety and eq 1b refers to the formation
of N-hydrogenated pyridine (which has the N–H bond) moiety
from their parent PAHs. The energy of substitutional formation reaction
can be calculated as 2a   2b  where Es on the rhs of eq 2 denote the total energies of the corresponding
species; subscripts HAC-N: and HAC-NH refer to the HACs with simple
pyridine and N-hydrogenated pyridine moieties, respectively. Accordingly,
the hydrogenation reaction that converts simple pyridine moiety to
N-hydrogenated pyridine can be written as 3  and the hydrogenation energy is 4  The formation reaction energies depending
on the sizes of HACs and substitutional positions are plotted in Figure 2a, and the numerical
data are given in Table S1 in the Supporting
Information (SI). The size is represented by the array [n,1], meaning a model with n fused rings in one stripe,
and the numbering of the substitutional position has been denoted
in Figure 1a. It is
clearly seen that the formation energies of the pyridine moiety are
almost independent of either the model size or substitutional position;
the values are distributed in a small range from 0.45 to 0.55 eV calculated
according to eq 2a. The
formation energies of N-hydrogenated pyridine moieties, on the other
hand, show a strong dependence on both size and position. For HACs
of the same size, nitrogen substitution on the zigzag edge (position
1a, 2a, etc.) is always more stable than that on the short edge (position
1b), and the middle position of the zigzag edge gives the most stable
form (e.g., HAC[5,1]NH@3a). As the fused-ring stripe elongates, the
formation energy of N-hydrogenated pyridine moiety gets lower, even
lower than the simple pyridine moiety.

Figure 2 (a) Formation reaction
energies of simple pyridine (N:) and N-hydrogenated
pyridine (NH) moieties and (b) hydrogenation reaction energies of
pyridine moieties of quasi-1D HACs. The sizes of model species are
indicated by HAC[n,1]N, and the substitutional positions
of nitrogen (defined in Figure 1) are noted along the horizontal axis.

The hydrogenation energies of pyridine moieties are plotted
in Figure 2b, and the
trend
is nearly identical to the formation energies of N-hydrogenated pyridine
moieties because the formation energies of simple pyridine moieties
are quite uniform. The Gibbs free energies of the hydrogenation reactions
have also been calculated at the standard conditions. They were found
to be uniformly slightly higher than Eh by ∼0.25 eV, with identical trend of size- and position-dependence
(see Figure S1 in the SI for comparison).
It implies that when one obtains α-naphthoquinoline (C17H11N, in our notation HAC[4,1]N@2a), there may be the
coexisting C17H11NH; when one synthesizes HAC[7,1]N
compounds, there would be preference for C29H17NH rather than C29H17N.

The investigation
then extended to 2D single-nitrogen-doped graphene
nanoflakes with [n,m] arrays of
fused rings as indicated in Figure 1b. The formation energies and hydrogenation energies
of HAC[7,1]N to HAC[7,7]N models are demonstrated in Figure 3a. Different from quasi-1D
HACs, the ground states of the multiple-row models with simple pyridine
moiety were calculated as open-shell singlets. Despite the difference
in spin multiplicity, the formation energies of these pyridine models
were still rather uniform in the range from 0.4 to 0.6 eV. The N-hydrogenated
moieties, on the other hand, showed that substitutions on zigzag edges
(positions 21a, 31a, 41a) were generally more stable than those on
armchair edges (13b, 14a). And the most stable species presented independence
of the number of armchair rows, e.g., all HAC[7,m]NH@41a models had similar formation energies. The hydrogenation
energies shown in Figure 3b followed the same trend.

Figure 3 (a) Formation energies of simple pyridine
(N:) and N-hydrogenated
pyridine (NH) moieties and (b) hydrogenation energies of pyridine
moieties of single-nitrogen-doped graphene nanoflakes. The sizes of
model species are indicated by HAC[n,m]N and the substitutional positions of nitrogen (defined in Figure 1) are noted along
the horizontal axis.

The following question arises: If the N-hydrogenated species
could
be energetically more stable than the simple pyridine moieties, why
are they not observed or reported in experiments? One may first doubt
the reliability of DFT calculation results. A possible concern relates
to the zigzag edges of graphene nanoflakes, where the open-shell character
may cause difficulty and artifact in frontier MOs by DFT calculations.
This issue has in fact been demonstrated and interpreted in literatures
that spin-unrestricted DFT is adequate for such systems.20,21,25 Moreover, the extraordinary stability
appears in not only graphene nanoflakes but also quasi-1D HACs with
as small as 4–5 fused aromatic rings, where the MOs are quite
definite (see following sections) and have nothing to do with the
artifact. Calculations applying very different density functionals
(Table S1 in the SI) also give consistent
trends in the formation reaction energies, and hence the DFT results
should be reliable.

We turn back to seek the experimental explanation
of the nonexistence
of N-hydrogenated pyridine species. A probable reason is the radical
character of the N-hydrogenated moiety, which means a high reactivity
in the synthesis process especially in a “crowded” environment
such as solvent or high-pressure gases.26−29 A second possibility is attributed
to the hydrogenation mechanism, where a thermally stable species does
not guarantee that it is kinetically preferable. The concept of “chemical
hardness” may give some clues to this issue. The chemical hardness
quantitatively describes the resistance of a compound to deformation
or change, and to the zeroth-order approximation it is equal to the
HOMO–LUMO energy gap.30,31 Referring to Figure 4, the gap values
of pyridine moieties are always larger than those of the corresponding
N-hydrogenated species, probably implying the kinetic instability
of the latter.

Figure 4 (a) Hückel and (b) DFT/B3LYP frontier MO energy
levels of
quasi-1D HACs.

Furthermore, the common
knowledge about the aromaticity of pyridine
may prevent people from thinking of its hydrogenated (not protonated)
species. We suppose that under a proper condition like highly reductive
gases, long-stripe HACs with N-hydrogenated pyridine moieties have
a chance to be formed and detected.

3.2 Frontier
MO Energy Levels
A comparison
of Hückel MO energies of quasi-1D HACs with simple pyridine
(N:) and N-hydrogenated pyridine (NH) moieties is depicted in Figure 4a, where the energy
scale is represented by the Coulomb integral (a) and the bond integral (b). For pyridine moieties, HOMO and LUMO energies are close to their
pristine PAH analogues, and the HOMO–LUMO gaps decrease smoothly
when the numbers of fused rings increase just as expected. For N-hydrogenated
moieties, the one extra electron could be regarded to be injected
into the original LUMO of simple pyridine moiety (to form a new SOMO),
and dragging this energy level downward to the original HOMO. This
SOMO level gets lower when the HAC elongates, representing an overall
trend toward stability.

This scenario is more clear and precise
in the DFT-calculated MOs shown in Figure 4b. The extra electron of N-hydrogenated moiety
creates a dopant-like SOMO level (here given the α-spin) in
the original HOMO–LUMO gap of the pyridine moiety, and this
level energy goes lower when the HAC elongates. In fact, this SOMO
level energy is always negative even in the smallest hydrogenated
pyridine (C5H5NH) model, implying a bond state
and the stability of its existence. As the overall size-dependent
trend of gap decreases and SOMO stabilization can be clearly seen
in the figure, the position-dependent stability is also indicated.
In models of the same size, nitrogen substitution near the center
of zigzag edge gives the lowest HOMO energy for both pyridine and
N-hydrogenated moieties.

3.3 Frontier MO Distributions,
Excitation Configurations,
and Spectroscopy
The DFT-calculated distributions of frontier
MOs are plotted in Figure 5 taking HAC[5,1]N@3a as an example (more detailed maps are
given in Figure S2 in the SI). For the
pyridine moiety, all frontier MOs have the π character with
one nodal plane coinciding with the molecular plane, whereas the nonbonding
orbital (lone pair) takes place as HOMO – 3. For the N-hydrogenated
pyridine moiety, the distributions are almost identical to the pyridine
moiety, and the extra electron (with the α-spin) resides in
the π* SOMO, which is just like the original LUMO. The pyridinic
nonbonding orbital now forms N–H σ bond and associates
with other C–C σ bonds, and its energy goes down to SOMO –
8.

Figure 5 Electron density distributions of frontier MOs of pyridine-type
HAC[5,1]N@3a (C21H13N, left) and its N-hydrogenated
moiety (C21H13NH, right). The correspondence
of most MOs between two models species is obvious, whereas the major
difference occurs for nonbonding of pyridine moiety vs σ-bonding
of N-hydrogenated moiety.

These MO distributions are closely related to their electronic
excitation configurations and UV–vis absorption spectra, which
are simulated in Figure 6. For pyridine moieties, it is clearly seen that the major peak positions
and intensities (assigned as peak A) are independent of the substitutional
position for same-sized HACs and are almost identical to their PAH
analogues, which is attributed to the isoelectronic character of these
aromatic compounds.14,15 And these peaks red-shift as
the model size increases, e.g., 7.56 eV for pyridine (HAC[1,1]N),
5.37 eV for acridine (HAC[3,1]N@2a), 4.38 eV for HAC[5,1]N@3a, and
3.82 eV for HAC[7,1]N@4a, due to the quantum confinement effect.14,15,32 These peak As correlate with
π–π* transitions with excitation configurations
of HOMO – 2 → LUMO and HOMO → LUMO + 2, generating
one more nodal plane in the destination MOs (cf. Figure 6). There are small peaks of
same transition configuration but different coefficients in the lower
energy range, e.g., 3.26 eV for HAC[5,1]N@3a and 2.91 eV for HAC[7,1]N@4a,
assigned as peak B. And the lowest transitions of HOMO → LUMO
appear with the lowest energy in the spectra, e.g., 1.98 eV for HAC[5,1]N@3a
and 1.25 eV for HAC[7,1]N@4a, assigned as peak C. All of the above
peaks correspond to π–π* transitions, whereas the n–π* transitions are invisible because of symmetry
forbiddenness. A comparison of representative peak positions is listed
in Table 1.

HACs of different sizes and substitutional sites. The hindmost (gray)
profiles correspond to pristine PAHs.

For N-hydrogenated moieties, the spectra show numerous small peaks,
which correspond to various combinations of excitation configurations
and depend on substitutional positions without apparent regulation.
The only rough common feature is the major peaks, assigned as peak
A′, with energies around peak A of the pyridine moieties. The
peak A′ corresponds to the β HOMO → LUMO + 2 transition
in HAC[5,1]NH@3a, where β MO energy levels are quite like the
pyridine moiety (less perturbed by the extra electron of α-spin,
cf. Figure 4b) and
hence present roughly similar excitation energies. A similar situation
applies to 2D graphene nanoflakes with single nitrogen dopants, whose
absorption spectra are plotted in Figure S3 in the SI. The ground states of HAC[n,m]N with n > 3, m ≥ 3
are
found to be open-shell singlet instead of closed-shell ones,12,15,19 and this fact makes the spectra
somewhat more complicated while keeping a similar overall trend. The
pyridine moieties show a uniform size dependence and position independence,
whereas the N-hydrogenated moieties present irregular profiles.

IR and Raman spectra could provide another aspect to distinguish
simple pyridine and N-hydrogenated pyridine moieties. As shown in Figure 7, the unique peaks
located around 3460 cm–1 corresponding to the N–H
vibrational mode appear only for N-hydrogenated pyridine moieties.
This peak could be distinguished from the N–H vibrational modes
of protonated pyridine around 3410 cm–1, pyrrole
moiety around 3520 cm–1, and amino groups around
3410 and 3500 cm–1.33 (See Table S2 in the SI for details.)
Although the intensity of this peak might be diluted as the compound
grows larger, it would be clear and observable in small- to medium-sized
HACs.

spectra of quasi-1D HACs and nitrogen-contained graphene nanoflakes.
Whereas the C–H and C=C vibrational modes appear for
all model species, the N–H modes are additionally found in
the N-hydrogenated moiety.

In summary, HACs and N-doped graphene nanoflakes with pyridine
moiety show a clear dependence on model sizes but hardly on substitutional
positions of nitrogen in their UV–vis absorption spectra, whereas
those with N-hydrogenated pyridine moiety show both dependency and
fingerprint-like spectra. In addition, the unique N–H vibration
mode in IR and Raman spectra belongs only to N-hydrogenated moiety.
These give us clues to identify N-hydrogenated pyridinic HACs if they
are synthesized.

4 Conclusions
In this
work, we have considered geometric structures, energies,
molecular orbitals, and electronic configurations of nitrogen-contained
quasi-1D HACs and graphene nanoflakes with a “bottom-up”
approach by increasing the number of building blocks. Many of these
properties depend on the model sizes, i.e., numbers of fused aromatic
rings, and are related to the positions of the substitutional nitrogen
atoms. The most interesting finding is that whereas the aromatic pyridine
moiety is known to be stable, the N-hydrogenated pyridine moiety could
be even more stable given sufficiently large model compounds and proper
substitutional sites. The hydrogenation reaction of the pyridine moiety
is found to be exothermic for models of four and more fused aromatic
rings with nitrogen substitution on the zigzag edges. The stability
of the N-hydrogenated species could be interpreted as a multiple effect
from the lowering of pyridinic LUMO energy in a large HAC, the correlation
of the one extra electron with other electrons, and the formation
of the N–H bond. However, the N-hydrogenated moiety is not
yet reported in experiments probably due to its radical character
and hence high reactivity.

We have also calculated and compared
the UV–vis absorption
spectra and IR/Raman spectra of these heterocyclic species. The pyridine
moieties present π–π* transitions just like pristine
PAHs, showing a strong size-dependence due to quantum confinement
effect but a little position-dependence attributed to their isoelectronic
characteristics. The N-hydrogenated moieties, on the other hand, possess
irregular, fingerprint-like spectra case by case. Moreover, the pyridinic
N–H vibrational modes are apparent and unique for the N-hydrogenated
models. In conclusion, we have confirmed the energetic stability of
the N-hydrogenated pyridine moiety in large HACs from the theoretical
point of view and provided spectroscopic hints to detect them in the
experiments.
