Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction
reaction (ORR) are important reactions of energy storage and conversion
devices. Therefore, it is highly desirable to design efficient and
dual electrocatalysts for replacing the traditional noble-metal-based
catalysts. Herein, we have developed a high-efficiency and low-cost
MnCo2O4-rGO nanocomposite derived from bimetal-organic
frameworks. For OER, MnCo2O4-rGO showed an onset
potential of 1.56 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode
(RHE)) and a current density of 14.16 mA/cm2 at 1.83 V,
being better than both pure MnCo2O4 and Pt/C.
For ORR, MnCo2O4-rGO exhibited a half-wave potential
(E1/2) of 0.77 V (vs RHE), a current density
of 3.33 mA/cm2 at 0.36 V, a high electron transfer number n (3.80), and long-term stability, being close to the performance
of Pt/C. The high activity of MnCo2O4-rGO was
attributed to the synergistic effect among rGO, manganese, and cobalt
oxide. As a result, the resultant MnCo2O4-rGO
has a great potential to be applied as a high-efficiency ORR and OER
electrocatalyst.

1 Introduction
With the development of
economy and society, there has been a growing demand for green energy
because of the nonrenewable fossil fuel energy sources.1−3 The metal–air battery has become the focus of research due
to its higher energy density than the current state-of-the-art lithium-ion
batteries, high conversion efficiency, environment friendliness, etc.4,5 The cathode reactions in the metal–air battery, namely, the
oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in the discharge process and the oxygen
evolution reaction (OER) in the charging process, play a key role
in the energy conversion efficiency.6−9 However, the kinetics of the ORR and OER
are slow due to the high overpotential; therefore, the development
of good bifunctional catalysts has become the key to improve the metal–air
battery.10−13 It is well known that platinum, iridium, and ruthenium are excellent
catalysts for the ORR and OER. However, the disadvantages of high
cost, limited reserves, poor durability, and rapid inactivation seriously
hamper their large-scale applications in the ORR and OER.14−20 Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop high-performance and
inexpensive bifunctional non-noble-metal electrocatalysts.21

Cobalt-based binary spinel-type metal
oxides as inexpensive bifunctional non-noble-metal electrocatalysts,
such as MnCo2O4,22−26 CuCo2O4,27 NiCo2O4,28 etc., show excellent performance in the ORR and OER because of their
redox stability, the complementation and synergy of two metals, and
their variable valence state.22−28 Especially, MnCo2O4 has been widely utilized
in metal–air battery, alkaline fuel cells, and solid oxide
fuel cells.22−26 At the same time, graphene is a famous carbonaceous material with
a single layer of carbon atoms tightly packed into a two-dimensional
honeycomb lattice structure.28,29 Compared with other
carbon materials, graphene has a larger specific surface area, excellent
conductivity, and higher electrochemical stability, and produces a
synergistic effect on binding with a metal oxide, which can improve
the electrocatalytic activity of oxide and stability.30,31 For example, Dai et al. reported spinel manganese-cobalt oxide/graphene
nanocomposites with advanced oxygen reduction electrocatalytic activity
because of their synergistic effect between cobalt oxide, managese
oxide, and graphene.15 Despite these efforts,
studies on MnCo2O4/nanocarbon bifunctional catalysts
for the ORR and OER are still scarce. Significant performance gaps
remain unfilled to furnish bifunctional catalytic activity on a par
with precious-metal-based catalysts.

On the other hand, metal-organic
frameworks (MOFs) with various morphologies and architectures composed
of metal ions and bridging ligands have been known as highly potential
precursors or sacrificial templates to prepare a series of tailorable
porous inorganic micro/nanomaterials,32−34 such as porous hollow
metal oxides. Apart from the more specific surface area, which could
increase the contact surface between electrode material and electrolyte,
the porous microstructure could provide more catalytic active sites,
resulting in enhanced electrochemical activities.35−38 However, there are less reports
about MnCo2O4-rGO nanocomposites derived from
bimetal-organic frameworks (MOFs)/graphene oxides.39

Herein, we report a MnCo2O4-reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposite derived from bimetal-organic
frameworks (MOFs)/graphene oxides as the pyrolytic precursors with
high-performance ORR and OER electrocatalysts, as bifunctional non-noble-metal
electrocatalysts. The ORR electrocatalytic activity of the MnCo2O4-rGO catalyst in a 0.1 M potassium hydroxide
solution is close to 20% of the commercial Pt/C, and the OER electrocatalytic
activity in a 1 M potassium hydroxide solution is better than that
of Pt/C, in terms of onset voltage and diffusion-limited current density.
The high electrocatalytic activities of MnCo2O4-rGO for the OER and ORR are caused by its porous spherical structure,
which promotes the transfer of electrons. The catalyst also shows
excellent stability in alkaline media. The method not only provides
a new route for synthesizing MnCo2O4-rGO but
also has the advantages of low cost and high yield, and thus, it can
be produced on a large scale and promote the development of metal–air
battery.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterizations of MnCo2O4-rGO
Figure 1 exhibits the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images of the MnCo2O4-rGO nanocomposites. As shown in Figure 1a, the as-prepared product consists of reduced
graphene oxides and nanorods with a diameter of 100 nm. These nanorods
appear to be wrapped between the rGOs. Figure 1b shows the TEM images of the MnCo2O4-rGO nanocomposites. It can be seen that the as-prepared
product consists of rGOs and MnCo2O4 nanrods,
which is consistent with the results of the SEM images. The selected
area electron diffraction pattern in Figure 1c suggests that the MnCo2O4-rGO nanocomposites are polycrystalline. The diffraction rings
match well with the (311) and (400) planes of spinel-structured MnCo2O4,40 in a good agreement
with the X-ray diffraction (XRD) results in the following part. To
further probe the incorporation of the MnCo2O4/rGO nanocomposites, energy-dispersive system (EDS) spectroscopy
was also used. Figure 1e–h displays the elemental mappings of Co (red), Mn (green),
O (blue), and C (yellow), revealing the presence of the Co, Mn, O,
and C elements in the MnCo2O4/rGO nanocomposites.

Figure 1 Characterizations
of MnCo2O4-rGO nanocomposites: (a) SEM images;
(b) TEM images; (c) SAED pattern; and (d–h) EDS mapping.

The Raman spectra of the MnCo2O4-rGO nanocomposites are shown in Figure 2a, which displays two prominent peaks around
1350 cm–1 (D band) and 1580 cm–1 (G band). It is well known that the intensity ratio of the D to
G band (ID/IG) was used to probe the ordered and disordered crystal structures
of carbon.41−43 The smaller the ID/IG ratio, the higher the degree of ordering in
the carbon material.42 The ID/IG value of the MnCo2O4-rGO nanocomposites is 0.98. Hence, the Raman
results correspond to the presence of rGOs in the MnCo2O4-rGO nanocomposites. Figure 2b presents the XRD pattern of the MnCo2O4-rGO nanocomposites. The characteristic peaks
correspond to well-crystallized MnCo2O4 (JCPDS
Card No. 30–0820) with the spinel structure of the (220), (311),
(400), (422), (511), and (440) planes.40 The structure of the MnCo2O4-rGO nanocomposites
is considered as a mixed valence oxide with a cubic spinel structure,
in which manganese and cobalt are distributed over the positions of
eight faces and tetrahedra.

Figure 2 (a) Raman spectra of MnCo2O4-rGO. (b) XRD patterns of MnCo2O4-rGO.

To further determine the elemental composition
and valence states, the MnCo2O4-rGO nanocomposites
were investigated by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). All
of the binding energies were corrected for specimen charging by referring
them to the C 1s peak (284.6 eV). Figure 3a shows the overall XPS spectra of the MnCo2O4-rGO nanocomposites, which clearly show the existence
of C, O, Mn, and Co. The atom ratio between Mn and Co is determined
to be 1:2, which is same as the theoretical value. The XPS spectrum
of Co 2p can be fitted by considering two spin–orbit doublet
characteristics of Co3+ and Co2+, indicating
the existence of Co with different valence states (Co3+ and Co2+) (Figure 3b).40 The two peaks located at
780.2 (Co 2p3/2) and 795.6 eV (Co 2p1/2) could
be ascribed to Co3+, while the peaks located at 780.9 (Co
2p3/2) and 795.5 eV (Co 2p1/2) could be ascribed
to Co2+. Similarly, as exhibited in Figure 3c, the spectrum of Mn 2p also indicates the
presence of Mn2+ and Mn3+. The main peaks locates
at 654.2 eV (Mn 2p1/2) and 642.8 (Mn 2p3/2)
belong to Mn3+, while the two peaks located at 641.8 (Mn
2p3/2) and 652.4 eV (Mn 2p1/2) could be ascribed
to Mn2+.39 The existence of
Mn3+/Mn2+ and Co3+/Co2+ solid-state redox couples could provide a notable electrochemical
activity. The XPS spectrum of C 1s shows that three distinct C configurations
coexist, including carbonyl carbon (C=O), carbon (C–O),
and graphic carbon (C–C) (Figure 3d).27

2.2 Electrochemical Properties
To investigate
the ORR performance of the as-prepared samples, the prepared working
electrode was first placed in a N2-saturated and O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution for CV test. As can be seen
in Figure 4a, the MnCo2O4-rGO nanocomposites exhibited a superior ORR
activity, showing a more positive onset potential (∼0.89 V
vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) and peak potential (∼0.72
V vs RHE) and a much higher peak current density (2.58 mA cm–2) than MnCo2O4 (∼0.83, 0.60 V, and 1.32
mA cm–2, respectively). The onset potential for
the Pt/C catalyst (20 wt % Pt on Vulcan HCA-PT20) is located at 0.93
V vs RHE, only ∼40 mV more positive than that of the MnCo2O4-rGO nanocomposites, but the peak current density
of the Pt/C catalyst (2.26 mA cm–2) is lower than
that of the MnCo2O4-rGO nanocomposites. This
indicates that the addition of graphene in MnCo2O4 can increase the ORR catalytic activity to close to commercial Pt/C
in 0.1 M KOH. It should be noted that the electrocatalytic performance
of pure rGO is limited according to previous reports.44,45 Hence, pure rGO is not considered in further ORR study.

and Pt/C in O2-saturated (solid lines) and N2-saturated (dashed lines) 0.1 M KOH electrolyte solution at a scan
rate of 50 mV/s. (b) linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) curves of MnCo2O4-rGO in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH at
a scan rate of 10 mV/s at different rotating- disk electrode (RDE)
rotation rates (rpm). (c) LSV curves of MnCo2O4, MnCo2O4-rGO, and Pt/C in O2-saturated
0.1 M KOH with a sweep rate of 10 mV/s at 1600 rpm and (d) the corresponding
Tafel slopes.

The rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements
were usually employed to delve into the ORR kinetics and mechanism
of the MnCo2O4-rGO nanocomposites, and LSV polarization
curves were recorded at different rotation rates in an O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution (Figure 4b), which exhibits an increase in the limiting current
density with an increase in the rotation rate. The Koutecky–Levich
(K–L) plots extracted from the above LSV polarization
curves (between 0.6 and 0.4 V) (Figure 4b inset) exhibit a linear relationship between J–1 and ω–1/2.
The fitting lines are almost parallel, indicating that the first-order
reaction kinetics is related to the concentration of dissolved oxygen
and has a similar electron transfer number (n) at
different voltages of ORR. It is reported that the mechanism of electron
transfer in the ORR is a direct and effective four-electron reduction
reaction46,47 [eq 1] or two-electron reduction reaction44 [eq 2], and the electron
transfer number (n) can be calculated on the basis of the Koutecky–Levich
(K–L) equations48 1   2   3   4   5  where J is the measured current
density, JL and JK are the diffusion- and kinetic-limited current densities,
respectively, ω is the angular velocity (rpm), n is the electron transfer number, F is the Faraday
constant (96 485 C/mol), C0 is
the bulk concentration of O2 (1.19 mol m–3 in 0.1 M KOH), D0 is the diffusion coefficient of O2 (1.88 × 10–9 m2/s in 0.1
M KOH), v is the kinematic viscosity of the electrolyte
(10–6 m2/s in 0.1 M KOH), the constant
0.2 is adopted when the rotation speed is expressed in rpm, and k is the electron transfer rate constant. According to eqs 3–5, the average electron transfer number (n) of MnCo2O4-rGO was calculated as 3.8 on the
basis of the Koutecky–Levich (K–L) equations, indicating
a four-electron transfer process. Thus, H2O is directly
formed as an intermediate product from oxygen by consuming four electrons
according to the previous literature.44 The four-electron reduction reaction pathway is favorable for increasing
the reaction rate, so it has important applications in metal–air
batteries.

Figure 4c displays the linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) of the MnCo2O4, MnCo2O4-rGO, and Pt/C at a rotating
rate of 1600 rpm in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH. It can be seen
that the pure MnCo2O4 material exhibits poor
electrocatalytic activity toward ORR in an alkaline solution, while
MnCo2O4-rGO represents a higher electrocatalytic
activity (onset potential of 1.11 V, current density of −3.33
mA/cm2 at 0.36 V) than MnCo2O4 (onset
potential of 1.12 V, current density of −2.30 mA/cm2 at 0.36 V). Therefore, the combination of graphene and MnCo2O4 is essential to improve the electrochemical
activity of ORR. On the other hand, the E1/2 value of MnCo2O4-rGO is 0.77 V, similar to
that of Pt/C at 0.80 V and more positive than that of pure MnCo2O4 at 0.66 V, as shown in Figure 4c. The slope of the Tafel plots of MnCo2O4-rGO was −150.1 mV/dec, better than the
ones of MnCo2O4 (−142.2 mV/dec) and Pt/C
(−120.2 mV/dec) (Figure 4d). These results further confirmed that the MnCo2O4-rGO nanocomposite is an efficient electrochemical catalyst
for the ORR and had very good kinetic processes.

As a bifunctional
catalyst, excellent ORR and OER activities are both required. Therefore,
the OER catalytic activity of MnCo2O4-rGO was
also evaluated. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was carried out in
a N2-saturated 1 M KOH solution at a rotating rate of 1600
rpm for MnCo2O4, MnCo2O4-rGO, and Pt/C (Figure 5a). The onset potential and the current density are the main parameters
to evaluate the catalytic activity of the sample on OER. The onset
potential of MnCo2O4 is 1.63 V, and the current
density is 6.12 mA/cm2 at 1.83 V. Furthermore, the onset
potential of MnCo2O4-rGO is 1.56 V, and the
current density reached 14.16 mA/cm2 at 1.83 V. The results
showed that the addition of graphene could enhance the OER performance.
It should be noted that the onset potential of MnCo2O4-rGO is lower than that of Pt/C (1.65 V) and the current density
of MnCo2O4-rGO is higher than that of Pt/C (2.75
mA/cm2 at 1.83 V), which demonstrated that the OER activity
of MnCo2O4-rGO is better than that of commercial
Pt/C. The OER dynamics of these samples was also evaluated with the
corresponding Tafel plots (Figure 5b).20 The slope of MnCo2O4-rGO was 106.9 mV/dec, better than that of pure
MnCo2O4 (130.0 mV/dec) and Pt/C (134.0 mV/dec).
The results showed that the combination of MnCo2O4 and graphene effectively promoted the kinetic process. The high
activity of MnCo2O4-rGO is ascribed to the synergistic
effect between cobalt oxide, manganese oxide, and graphene.

and Pt/C in N2-saturated 1 M KOH with a sweep rate of 10
mV/s at 1600 rpm. (b) Tafel plots of MnCo2O4, MnCo2O4-rGO, and Pt/C for OER.

The stability of the electrocatalyst is another
important factor to evaluate its application. To investigate the electrochemical
stability of catalysts, chronoamperometric analysis can be used. The
chronoamperometric measurements of MnCo2O4,
MnCo2O4/rGO catalyst, and Pt/C were carried
out in an O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution at a fixed potential
of 0.4 V at 1600 rpm. As shown in Figure S2, the retention rate of the current density of the MnCo2O4-rGO composite is much higher than that of MnCo2O4 and Pt/C, showing that the MnCo2O4-rGO composite has a higher retention rate and coulombic efficiency
and a lower internal resistance than MnCo2O4 and Pt/C. In addition, the current does not decline. It could be
concluded that the MoCo2O4-rGO composite has
a long-term stability for electrocatalytic activity, indicating that
MoCo2O4-rGO has structural and chemical stabilities
after stability test.

3 Conclusions
In this work, a new bifunctional
electrocatalyst with excellent ORR and OER activities was designed
and synthesized by the combination of MnCo2O4 and graphene. MnCo2O4-rGO showed a higher
activity than MnCo2O4 for both the ORR and OER
due to a synergistic effect of the graphene and MnCo2O4. It should be noted that the OER activity of MnCo2O4-rGO is also better than that of the commercial Pt/C
catalyst. On the whole, the MnCo2O4-rGO nanocomposite
is an excellent bifunctional electrocatalyst for the OER and ORR,
and is expected to be a good bifunctional oxygen electrode for metal–air
batteries.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
All of the chemicals were
directly used after purchase without further purification. Deionized
water was used for the preparation of all solutions.

4.2 Synthesis of MnCo2O4/rGO Composite
Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized from
graphite by a modified Hummers’ method, similar to our previous
reports.49−51 In a typical synthesis, 0.414 g of manganese acetate
and 0.881 g of cobalt acetate were dispersed in 30 mL of deionized
water, then 50 mL of a GO solution (1 mg/mL) was added in it as solution
A, and 0.752 g of fumaric acid was dispersed into 30 mL of ethanol
as solution B. Then, solution B was added into solution A under continuous
stirring for 30 min, and the reaction mixture was transferred into
a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The hydrothermal
reaction was carried out at 200 °C for 6 h. The product was collected
by centrifugation and washed three times with water and ethanol before
drying. Finally, the dried powder was put in a tubular furnace at
600 °C for 3 h at a 4 °C/min heating rate in nitrogen. For
comparison, MnCo2O4 was synthesized under a
similar condition without the presence of GO.

4.3 Material Characterizations
The crystal
structures of the as-prepared products were determined by X-ray diffraction
(XRD, XRD-6000) using the Cu Ka radiation (0.15406 nm). The microstructures
and morphologies of the products were characterized using scanning
electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL, JSM 6480) and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM, Philips Tecnai 12) with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis
(EDX). The Raman spectra of the as-prepared products were obtained
by a Renishaw Raman spectrometer.

4.4 Electrochemical Measurements
All
electrochemical tests were carried out on an electrochemical workstation
(CHI 760E, Chenhua Ltd. Co., China) with a conventional three-electrode
cell. A Pt foil and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were applied
as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The working
electrode was prepared by loading the catalysts on a glassy carbon
electrode with a disk diameter of 5 mm (disk area = 0.1963 cm2 ) and as the rotating disk electrode. The sample ink was
prepared by mixing 4.12 mg of material, 50 μL of 5 wt % Nafion
solution, 200 μL of ethanol, and 800 μL of deionized water
followed by 30 min of sonication, forming a homogeneous catalyst ink.
Then, 20 μL of the homogeneous ink was dropped onto the glassy
carbon with the corresponding mass loading and dried slowly in air.
Similarly, 2.06 mg of 20 wt % Pt was used to prepare the ink and 20
μL was dropped onto the glassy carbon electrode with a mass
loading of 0.20 mg/cm2.

Before test, a N2 or O2 flow was introduced into the electrolyte in the
cell for 30 min to give a saturation state. The working electrode
was cycled with a scan rate of 20 mV/s for at least 50 times before
the data collection. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were done
at a scan rate of 50 mV/s in a N2- or O2-saturated
KOH solution (0.1 mol/L). The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) experiments
were conducted in an O2-saturated KOH (0.1 M) solution
at different speed rates (400, 625, 900, 1225, 1600, 2025, 2500 rpm)
at a scan rate of 10 mV/s. As for OER, the LSV experiments were different
with ORR. They were conducted in a N2-saturated KOH (1.0
M) solution at a scan rate of 10 mV/s, and the data were collected
after stabilization. The stability tests for ORR were carried out
at 0.4 V in an O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution (ω
= 1600 rpm) by the chronoamperometric method. The recorded potentials
all use a negative scan pattern, and the potentials were referenced
to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) through RHE calibration
(E(RHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + 0.0951pH
+ 0.197). Furthermore, to ensure O2 saturation, the gas
was bubbled into the electrolyte prior to the start of each experiment
and maintained over the electrolyte during each measurement.
