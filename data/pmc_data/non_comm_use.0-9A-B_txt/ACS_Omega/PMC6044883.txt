The
effects of compound loading on the identification of protein
kinases (PKs) was examined using two previously reported sepharose-supported
PK inhibitors (PKIs): bisindolylmaleimide X (S1) and
CZC8004 (S2). Compound loadings of 0.1, 0.5, 2.5, 5,
10, 25, and 50% content and an ethanolamine-blocked control bead (no
compound) were investigated. A 50% bead loading gave the highest level
of PK identification for both S1 and S2,
extracting 34 and 55 PKs, respectively, from a single cell lysate.
Control beads allowed overall identification of 23 PKs, which we term
the kinase beadome, whereas sepharose-supported sunitinib (S7; 50% loading) identified 20, 11 of which were common to the control
beads. The reliability of bead pull-downs was examined in duplicate
experiments using two independently synthesized batches each of S1 and S2. Bead S1 showed high similarity
in the absolute numbers of PKs identified across two experiments,
at 40 and 35 PKs, of which 26 were common across the two batches of
beads, with 14 and 9 unique PKs identified in each experiment. The S2 beads extracted 61 and 64 PKs with 55 PKs common across
the two bead batches examined. We also report on the development and
use of a novel promiscuous PKI analogue, 2-[(5-chloro-2{[4-(piperazin-1-yl)phenyl]amino}pyrimidin-4-yl)amino]-N-methylbenzene-sulfonamide (S15), which extracted
12 additional unique PKs over the two parent compounds from which
it was designed, the combination of which identifies 160 unique PKs. S15 was based on the common pyrimidine core scaffold of S9 and S10. Thus, S15 expands the
utility of kinobeads by broadening the kinome coverage for bead-based
pull-down. Combining the data for all beads across 90 and 180 min
liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS)/MS analysis
identified a total of 160 unique PKs.

==== Body
Introduction
From studying their
molecular mechanisms, it is apparent that small
molecules and drugs, even targeted drugs, are typically promiscuous.
With most small molecule compounds, the mantra “one drug, one
target” should be replaced with “one drug, multiple
targets”.1 Polypharmacology drugs
may be advantageous when compared with highly selective pharmacological
agents.2−4 Multitarget activities may lead to increased efficacy
with reduced susceptibility to drug resistance. Examples of effective
multitarget drugs include aspirin (inflammation) and various selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; depression) and imatinib (cancer).5−10

Traditionally, drug discovery efforts have been focused on
in vitro
assays comprising a subset of the target protein family used as purified
recombinant proteins. Although this strategy performs well in identifying
early leads, it offers only a limited possibility of revealing off-targets.
This can partially explain some of the common discrepancies that arise
when correlating in vitro assay results with efficacy in cellular
or animal models.11,12

Mass spectrometry (MS)-based
chemical proteomics has recently emerged
as a powerful tool for identification of both the polypharmacology
and off-target actions of drug candidates.12−14 Advances in
quantitative MS enable relatively routine largescale experimentation.
It is possible to quantitate thousands of proteins in a single experiment
using both labeled and label-free approaches.15 This can be done on a system-wide basis or using various methodologies
to selectively study specific cellular components.16,17

The human genome contains 538 protein kinases (PKs) and more
than
2000 other ATP and purine-binding proteins, thus examination of the
polypharmacological activities and “off-targets” associated
with kinase inhibitors is essential.13,18 A multitude
of PK inhibitors (PKIs) target the ATP-binding site of kinases, which
have conserved structural elements across the family, and thus is
unlikely to be selective toward a single kinase. A chemical proteomics
approach based on Kinobead technology has proved to be important in
the development of a kinase inhibitor target and off-target profile,
confirming the polypharmacology of many clinical drugs.5−7,10,19,20

The development of kinobeads and related
chemical proteomics approaches
for affinity-based protein profiling requires the immobilization of
the small molecule inhibitor to a solid support.21−24 The immobilization step itself
presents several challenges, as it may not be synthetically possible
with the parent small molecule compound, requiring potentially complex
synthetic modifications, which may lead to reduced on-target potency
or the introduction of additional off-target effects. The existing
functional groups suitable for coupling may be critical binding residues,
and thus coupling potentially removes target affinity. These issues
have begun to be addressed through the development of multiple generations
of kinobeads.15 After bead immobilization,
the probe must be still capable of accessing the target ATP-binding
site, and this can be affected by the nature of the solid support.
Probe-target accessibility may also be affected by the nature of the
surface packing and the effect of reactive moieties on the surface
of the solid support, which in turn may act synergistically, antagonistically,
or present multiple issues through nonspecific interactions with proteins
within the cell lysate. To date, there has been no systematic evaluation
of the amount of affinity probe loading onto the solid support or
the use of unloaded control beads to determine probe specificity,
nor has the effect of surface capping to reduce nonspecific binding
been evaluated.25 Herein, we report our
findings in these areas.

Results and Discussion
Most of the
current PKIs target the highly conserved ATP-binding
pocket of PKs; thus, an expedient approach to probe development has
been based on known promiscuous PKIs, such as bisindolylmaleimide
X (BIMX; 1) and CZC8004 (2). These two PKIs
are commercially available, and have been the subject of previous
studies profiling their binding affinity for PK and purine-binding
proteins, and they both can be directly coupled to NHS-sepharose (Figure 1).26,27

Effect of Bead Loading on PK Capture
To determine the
optimal inhibitor loading for capturing PKs on beads, we investigated
the effects of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, and 50% loadings of BIMX
(1) and CZC8004 (2) in a series of pull-down
experiments from the lysates of HeLa cells (S1 and S2, respectively, where “S” indicates
that the PKI is sepharose-bound). The pull-down data revealed moderate
to high levels of PK binding, based on 90 min liquid chromatography
(LC)–MS/MS elution and MS evaluation (Figure 2). Efforts to examine higher bead loadings
(75 and 100%) were prevented due to lack of compound solubility and
poor reproducibility of the synthesis outcomes. Therefore, 50% loading
was the highest feasible in this study, while ensuring appropriate
quality control over synthesized beads.

Figure 2 (A) Number of PKs identified
by S1 as a function of
percentage of the PKI loading of 1 to sepharose beads
(S1). (B) As for (A) using 2. This data
includes only PKs identified using a 90 min LC–MS/MS analysis.
Analyses were conducted in duplicates (see Experimental
Procedures).

Upon decreasing the S1 bead loading from 50 to 10%,
there was a decrease in the number of PKs identified, and further
decreases to 5–0.1% produced variable data. The number of bound
PKs with S1 at 50 and 0.1% loading was identical, suggestive
of high levels of nonspecific binding in the 0.1% loading S1. With the S2 beads, there was a clearer dose–response
from 50 to 2% bead loading, with a decreasing number of PKs observed.
These data show that the highest number of PKs is observed with 50%
bead loading with both inhibitors. Despite both 1 and 2 being classified as promiscuous PKIs, relatively low numbers
of PKs were identified in HeLa cell lysates, with S1 binding
34 and S2 55 PKs, respectively.24,28,29 The relatively lower affinity with S1 exacerbated the nonspecific binding observed (Figure 2). Interestingly,
the use of a blank, ethanolamine-blocked control bead (identical to S1 and S2 beads, with 0% PKI loading) reproducibly
bound 14 PKs (based on a 90 min LC–MS/MS analysis). Around
1100 proteins were identified in all pull-downs, regardless of the
bead loading. There was no clear trend with lower bead loading causing
more “off-target” binding, or vice versa (Table S1). The only notable shift was in the
number of PKs bound as the bead loading increased (data not shown).

Reproducibly of PK Identification
We investigated the
variability between individual measurements with bound inhibitors
from two independently synthesized batches of beads through a duplicate
extraction and LC–MS/MS profiling of S1 and S2 in HeLa cell lysates. Bead S1 showed high
similarity in the absolute numbers of PKs identified at 40 and 35;
of these, 26 were common across the pull-down experiments with each
bead batch, thus there were 14 and 9 additional PKs identified in
each experiment. The combined evaluation of S1, in this
manner, afforded identification of a total of 49 PKs (Figure 3). The S2 beads
afforded a more robust interrogation of the HeLa cell lysates with
the identification of 61 and 64 PKs, with 55 in common across both
batches of S2 beads, for a combined total of 70 PKs.
Each S2 based experiment identified six and nine unique
PKs (Figure 3). For
the S2 beads, PKs that bound to only one batch of beads
were typically bound at low levels as revealed by a low peptide identification
count (data not shown). Given the stochastic nature of peptide selection
for MS/MS analysis and the complex nature of the samples, this is
not surprising. A similar outcome was evident for the S1 beads, excepting four PKs that were identified by >10 peptides
in
one batch and absent in the other (data not shown). The reason for
this is unclear at this time.

conducted in duplicate (Experimental Procedures).

Expanded Bead Catalog
Having established that 50% loading
was optimal, we then synthesized a range of other beads based on purvalanol
B (3), sunitinib (4), dasatinib (5) (the modified compounds for NHS-sepharose affixing are 6, 7, and 8, respectively, and the synthesis
methods are described in the Supporting Information), CTx-0294885 (9), and the Kuster compound 19 (KC19; 10) (Figure 4). PKIs, 9 and 10, were synthesized inhouse
(Supporting Information and below). At
50% loading, the residual active NHS ester sites were blocked through
treatment with ethanolamine. An ethanolamine-blocked control bead
was also prepared, to allow in situ correction for nonspecific binding
effects.

(4), dasatinib (5) (the modified compounds
for NHS-sepharose affixing are 6, 7, and 8, respectively) CTx-0294885 (9), and the Kuster
compound 19 (KC19; 10). The highlighted NH2 moieties represent the point of NHS-sepharose
bead attachment.

Exposure of the ethanolamine-blocked
control beads (no attached
PKI) to a HeLa cell lysate allowed identification of 23 PKs (Table S1), higher than that observed with the
sunitinib S7 probe (23 vs 20 PKs, with 9 PKs being unique
to the S7 probe and 11 matching those in the blank probe); Table 1). We call the 23
kinases that bound nonspecifically the “kinase beadome”.
In all instances, exposure of the corresponding sepharose-supported
analogues (S6, S7, S8, S9, and S10) to a HeLa cell lysate allowed identification
of moderate to high numbers of PKs, from 20 (sunitinib (S7)) to 105 (CTx-0294885 (S9)) PKs (Table 1). Although S9 and S10 resulted in 105 and 100 PKs being identified, there was approximately
an 80% overlap in the identified PKs. This was not surprising, given
their structural similarity, but suggests that additional structural
modification might afford either a more diverse or broader identification
of the kinome in HeLa cells.

Of the PKIs examined in Table 1, S9 (Ctx-0298845) and S10 (KC19)
were significantly more effective than S1–S8. The former two compounds comprised a common pyrimidine
core, differing only in the pendent moieties, with the S9-amide represented by the isosteric sulfonamide in S10. We therefore further explored the development of an S9/S10 hybrid through the synthesis of a novel compound
FD5180 (15). We merged the key structural features of 9 and 10 while retaining the common pyrimidine
core (Figure 5), leveraging
our prior synthesis of 9 and our in-house synthesis of 10.30,31

Figure 5 Merging of the common pharmacophoric elements
of 9 (CTx-0298845) and 10 (KC19) to afford
the hybrid analogue 15 (FD5180) for subsequent attachment
to sepharose beads.

Synthesis commenced with the generation
of sulfonamide 12 from 2-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride 11 and methylamine,
followed by a facile Fe/AcOH-mediated reduction of 12’s nitro moiety, affording 13.32 Several bases and reaction conditions were trialed in relation
to the nucleophilic aromatic substitution of 13 to afford 14, and employing cesium carbonate as base with microwave
irradiation led to the highest yield, albeit still modest at 29%,
of pyrimidine 14. The final step toward the synthesis
of both KC19 (10) and FD5180 (15) involved
a second SNAr reaction with the requisite amine (Scheme 1). In the generation
of 10, tert-butyl 4-aminobenzylcarbamate
was employed to prevent competing addition via the benzylamine moiety.
The nucleophilic substitution proceeded smoothly with simultaneous
boc-deprotection giving 10. With hybrid 15, tert-butyl 4-(4-aminophenyl)piperazine-1-yl)aniline
was employed and, in a similar manner, led to the generation of boc-deprotected 15 in a moderate yield (41%).

Characterization
of PKs Identified by Hybrid S15 (FD5180)
The
use of S15 (FD5180) in a series
of pull-down experiments from HeLa cell lysates with an LC–MS/MS
elution of 90 and 180 min resulted in the identification of 111 PKs
(with an overlap of 22 PKs with the control bead), a slightly larger
number than that observed with CTx-0298845 (S9) and KC19
(S10) (Table 1 and Figure 6). Importantly, each of the three beads identified a number of distinct
kinases (Figure 6).
Combining the data acquired for all beads across 90 and 180 min LC–MS/MS
analysis identified a total of 160 unique PKs.

Figure 6 Venn diagram showing
the overlap of unique PKs arising from pull
down of a HeLa lysate with S9, S10, or S15, after analysis using a 90 and 180 min LC–MS/MS
elution. Analyses were conducted in duplicate from 90 and 180 min
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) runs.

Despite the similar structural chemical motif spanning S9, S10, and S15, only 77 PKs were
common
to all three beads. Individually, S9, S10, and S15 yielded 16, 7, and 12 unique PKs, respectively.
Examination of the kinase classes identified highlighted that S15 showed good coverage of all major classes (TK, TKL, STE,
CMGC, CAMK, and AGC), only lacking in coverage of the CK1 class, as
does S10, with only S9 showing a low coverage
(Figure 7). Probe S15 showed more pronounced (than S9 and S10) coverage, in particular, of the AGC and CMGC kinase classes.
The kinase coverage by these beads is shown in Figures S25–S34. These data suggest that the simple
modifications made herein impart additional promiscuity to this class
of already broad spectrum PKIs.

Impact of Control Beads on Kinome Analysis
This is
the first evaluation of ethanolamine-blocked blank beads, which bind
23 PKs nonspecifically (Table 2). Relative quantitation shows that of the 23 PKs bound, 14
bind to all beads (including inhibitor-loaded S6–S10 and S15) at a similar level (Figures S1–S14), consistent with the proposed
nonspecific nature of this binding. Of the remaining nine PKs, most
bind at a similar level across S6–S10 and S15, again suggesting a high level of relatively
nonspecific binding (Figures S15–S22).

Conclusions
Our
data demonstrates that the level of chemical biology probe
(inhibitor) affixed to a solid support impacts the number of PKs identified
in a HeLa cell lysate. Examination of S1 and S2 beads loaded with 0.1, 0.5, 2.5, 5, 10, 25, and 50% inhibitor revealed
the optimal bead loading to be 50%. The use of control beads, for
the first time in a kinobead experiment, revealed significant levels
of nonspecific binding (what we term the “kinase beadome”),
which in one case surpassed the number of PKIs identified by inhibitor
bound beads, for example, sunitinib (S7) at 20 versus
23 PKs identified. These observations highlight the key role of including
appropriate control bead validation studies as an essential part of
the identification of a lead target compound.

Our study is the
first we are aware of that compares two separate
synthetic batches of the same bead used for pull-downs, demonstrating
reasonable reliability, robustness, and quality control. Using HeLa
cell lysate S1 afforded identification of 40 and 35 PKs,
respectively, with 14 and 9 unique PKs across S1-1 and S1-2. The S2 beads afforded a more robust interrogation
of the HeLa cell lysate with the identification of 61 and 64 PKs with
55 PKs in common across S2-1 and S2-2. Although
potentially adversely impacting the quantitation, this supports an
expansion of the kinome for a particular target compound, on the basis
of sequential analysis and pooling of the data attained. The data
demonstrates the need for better quality control in bead validation
studies.

Recent reports have positioned KC19 (S10) and CTx-0294885
(S9) as highly promiscuous PKIs, with a significant level
of structural similarity, which suggested further potential to enhance
the promiscuity of these compounds. Our data validates this hypothesis
through the synthesis and evaluation of 2-[(5-chloro-2{[4-(piperazin-1-yl)phenyl]amino}pyrimidin-4-yl)amino]-N-methylbenzene-sulfonamide (FD5180; S15) in
a HeLa cell lysate with the identification of 111 PKs in this single
experiment from a single cell type. S15 performs at a
similar overall level to S10 and S9 at 100
and 105 PKs, respectively. However, these three compounds were each
isolated from 7 to 16 kinases that were unique to each ligand. The
addition of S15 allowed a maximum of 160 or 147 PKs to
be identified over a 180 min or a 90 min LC–MS/MS experiment,
respectively, across these three beads. On the basis of a single evaluation
comparison of S15, S10, and S9, there were 77 common PKs identified, whereas S9, S10, and S15 further yielded 16, 7, and 12 unique
PKs, respectively. Therefore, 2-[(5-chloro-2{[4-(piperazin-1-yl)phenyl]amino}pyrimidin-4-yl)amino]-N-methylbenzene-sulfonamide (FD5180; S15) expands
the utility of kinobeads by broadening the kinome covered.

Using
a range of beads, a user can select broadly reactive (S15), or more specific (Sunitinib, S7) beads,
depending on the experimental requirements and the kinases being targeted
by each compound. The beads can be combined for greater overall kinome
coverage. Our study shows that for target validation, control beads
are an imperative.

Experimental Procedures
Chemistry General Procedures
All reactions were performed
using standard laboratory equipment and standard laboratory glassware.
Solvents and reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Matrix Scientific,
or Lancaster Synthesis and used as received. Organic solvents were
bulk quality and were redistilled from glass prior to use. Flash chromatography
was carried out using silica gel 200–400 mesh (60 Å).
Organic solvent extracts were dried with magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) and dried under reduced pressure with either Büchi
or Heidolph rotary evaporators. Melting points were recorded in open
capillaries on a Brüker 565 Melting Point Apparatus and are
expressed in degrees Celsius (°C). Electrospray mass spectra
were recorded using 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/H2O or
HPLC-grade methanol or acetonitrile as carrier solvents on a Shimadzu
LC–MS 2010 EV spectrometer or an Agilent 1260 LCMS system.
All compounds were of ≥95% purity as determined by HPLC and
LC–MS analysis.

NMR spectroscopy was performed on a Brüker
Avance III 400 MHz (or 600 MHz) spectrometer, where 1H
NMR and 13C NMR were acquired at 400 and 101 MHz (or 600
and 150 MHz), respectively. All spectra were recorded in deuterated
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d6) or deuterated
chloroform (CDCl3), obtained from Sigma-Aldrich or Cambridge
Isotope Laboratories Inc., unless otherwise stated, with the residual
solvent peaks used as the internal reference (δ 2.49 (quintet)
and δ 39.7 (septet) for 1H NMR and 13C
NMR, respectively). Chemical shifts (δ) were measured in parts
per million (ppm) and referenced against the internal reference peaks.
Coupling constants (J) were measured in Hertz (Hz).
Multiplicities are denoted as singlet (s), broad singlet (br s), doublet
(d), doublet of doublets (dd), doublet of doublet of doublets (ddd),
triplet (t), triplet of doublets (td), doublet of triplets (dt), quartet
(q), quintet (quin), and multiplet (m). Peaks are listed in increasing
chemical shift in the following format: chemical shift (integration
(1H), multiplicity (1H), coupling constant (1H)).

(R)-N-(6-Aminohexyl)-2-chloro-4-((2-((1-hydroxy-3-methylbutan-2-yl)amino)-9-isopropyl-9H-purin-6-yl)amino)benzamide
A solution of (R)-tert-butyl (6-(4-((2-((1-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-3-methylbutan-2-yl)amino)-9-isopropyl-9H-purin-6-yl)amino)-2-chlorobenzamido)hexyl)carbamate (308
mg, 0.41 mmol) in THF (5 mL) was stirred at 0 °C. HCl (1.65 mL
of a 4 M dioxane solution) was added dropwise, and the mixture was
stirred and allowed to warm to room temperature overnight. The mixture
was diluted with water (20 mL), and the pH adjusted to 8 with the
addition of saturated NaHCO3 and extracted with ethyl acetate

Preparation of Sepharose
Beads
Solutions and Buffers
All buffers and solutions were
degassed before use and stored at 4 °C. Wash solution: 1 mM HCl;
organic coupling buffer (pH 8.3): 1:1 v/v DMSO/H2O, 100
mM NaHCO3; blocking agent (pH 8.3): 0.5 M ethanolamine,
0.5 M NaCl; acetate buffer (pH 4.4): 0.1 M acetic acid and 0.1 M sodium
acetate; sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.3): 0.2 M NaHCO3.

Coupling Inhibitors to Sepharose Beads
NHS-activated
Sepharose 4 fast flow (1 mL, 50% slurry, ex. GE Healthcare Life Sciences)
was added to a mini Bio-Spin column and treated with wash solution
(10 × 0.5 mL) followed by organic coupling buffer (2 × 0.5
mL). To the washed beads were added a stock solution of the inhibitor
(of desired concentration) and a 5:1 v/v DMSO/coupling buffer solution
(0.5 mL), and the reaction mixture was rotated end-over-end for 24
h. After this time, the matrices were washed with coupling buffer
(4 × 0.5 mL) (filtrate was retained for coverage analysis, via
LC–MS), treated with blocking agent, and then rotated end-over-end
for 24 h in the dark. After this time, the matrices were drained and
washed with acetate buffer (3 × 1 mL) and bicarbonate buffer
(3 × 1 mL); this sequence was repeated four times before storing
over 20% aqueous ethanol at 4 °C.

Using LC–MS analysis,
a quantitative study was carried out to determine the exact amount
of the inhibitor bound to sepharose. With the exception of CZC8004
(2), which returned a bead loading of 29–34%,
all other compounds returned bead loading values of 10–20%.

Preparation of Control Beads
NHS-activated Sepharose
4 fast flow (1 mL, 50% slurry, ex. GE Healthcare
Life Sciences) was added to a mini Bio-Spin column and washed with
wash solution (10 × 0.5 mL) followed by organic coupling buffer
(2 × 0.5 mL). Blocking agent was added, and the matrices were
rotated end-over-end for 24 h. After this time, the resin was washed
with acetate buffer (3 × 1 mL) and bicarbonate buffer (3 ×
1 mL); this sequence was repeated four times before storing over 20%
aqueous ethanol at 4 °C.

Kinomics: Pull-Down
A HeLa S3 cell pellet was resuspended
in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM
NaF, 1 mM DTT, 1.5 mM MgCl2·6H2O, 5% (v/v)
glycerol, 0.8% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mM PMSF, 1 μg/mL leupeptin,
1 Roche 11873 580001, EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail tablet
per 50 mL lysate) and sonicated for 60 s with a probe sonicator. A
lipid removal agent (Sigma) was added at 0.01 g/mL of lysate and incubated,
with mixing for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysate was centrifuged for
20 min at 45 000g, 4 °C. The supernatant
was collected and protein concentration, determined using a Millipore
Direct Detect. For pull down, 30 μL of a 50% slurry of each
bead was used in a Bio-Rad mini bio-spin column. Beads were washed
with lysis buffer prior to use. To each washed bead, 10.9 mg of lysate
was added and incubated for 60 min with mixing at 4 °C. All reactions
were conducted in duplicate. Following incubation, the beads were
washed three times (800 μL) with lysis buffer, then twice (800
μL) with 50 mM NH4HCO3, pH 7.8. An on-bead
digest was performed overnight with trypsin (Promega) at 37 °C.
Peptides were collected via centrifugation, and the beads were washed
first with 100 μL of 50 mM NH4HCO3, pH
7.8, and subsequently with 80 μL of 70% (v/v) acetonitrile and
0.5% (v/v) formic acid. The appropriate washes were pooled and vacuum-concentrated
prior to resuspension in 0.5% (v/v) formic acid and desalting using
Empore 1 mL SPE cartridges (Sigma). Following cleanup, the eluate
was vacuum concentrated and resuspended in 0.5% (v/v) formic acid
prior to MS analysis. Each bead was used individually for pull-down.

LC–MS/MS
Peptides were separated on a Eksigent
NanoLC Ultra fitted with an SGE C18P trap column (10 mm × 300
μm) and a self-packed C18 (Dr. Maisch, Reprosil-C18-AQ, 3 μm)
26 cm × 75 μm column. Peptides were separated over a 90
or 180 min run at 350 nL/min and fed directly into an AB SCIEX 5600
MS. The top 30 peptides were subjected to MS/MS, and the data searched
against human proteins in Uniprot (301 202 sequences) using
Mascot 2.5.1, X!Tandem Sledgehammer (2013.09.01.1), MSGF + (v10282),
and Comet (2015.02 rev 4), the latter three utilizing SearchGUI 2.4.1.33 Data were postprocessed using PeptideShaker
1.7.1, and the peptide and protein FDR rates were set to 1%.34 The list of identified proteins from each LC–MS/MS
run was compared to a list of human PKs to determine which PKs bound
to each bead.

MS1 Quantitation
Skyline 3.5.0.9319
(64-bit) was used
for MS1 quantitation of samples analyzed using the 180 min run.35 A total of 30 light standard peptides were spiked
into each sample to allow for loading normalization. These peptides
were appended to the database used for searching. The sequence for
each of the identified PKs was added to Skyline, the peptide search
for each sample was loaded into Skyline, and the MS1 data were used
for quantitation of peaks within ±2 min of MS/MS identifications.
Peak integration was scored using the mProphet algorithm, and only
peaks with q-values <0.05 were used. Peak areas
are corrected for loading by dividing each peak by the sum total peak
area of added light standard peptides. As such, all peak areas are
expressed relative to the amount of the standard peptides. Data was
exported in the CSV format and filtered using Excel; peptide data
was combined into proteins using the InfernoRDN R-rollup function.36 Relative quantitation is only included for proteins
in which there were five or more peptides. Venn diagrams were produced
using the program VennDIS 1.0.1.37
