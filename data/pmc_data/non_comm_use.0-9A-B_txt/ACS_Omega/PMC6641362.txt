Plane-wave density
functional theory (PW-DFT) calculations have
been used to investigate the direct amination of benzene catalyzed
by a Ni(111) surface to explore the reaction intermediates and to
understand the role of nickel in this reaction. Adsorption structures,
sites, energetics, and proposed reaction pathways relevant to the
amination of benzene on the Ni(111) surface were investigated using
the spin-polarized slab model with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
functional. The dispersion-corrected DFT-D3 was used to examine the
effect of van der Waals interactions on the adsorption energy. Detailed
discussion of the adsorption behaviors of NH, NH2, C6H5, C6H5NH2, and
C6H5NH on the Ni(111) surface is provided. Imide
and benzene were predicted to be the most predominant adsorbed species
on the Ni(111) surface, and a reaction process involving a surface-bound
anilide as an intermediate was predicted to be more thermodynamically
favorable than other reaction pathways. The electronic interactions
and vibrational frequencies of isolated and adsorbed molecules were
also investigated.

1 Introduction
Green
chemical synthesis has been of significant interest for the
development of safe and efficient reaction processes that reduce the
generation of hazardous products and for economic benefits in the
chemical industry. One process that has widely attracted the attention
is the direct synthesis of aniline. Aniline (C6H5NH2) is an important building block in the chemical industry
as it can undergo numerous reactions involving either the amino group
or the aromatic ring. These reactions can be extended for various
industrial applications including the production of dyes, the production
of polyurethane, use in the rubber industry, and in the manufacturing
of pharmaceuticals, to name a few.1,2 In 2013, the
global annual production of aniline was ∼5 million tons and
was anticipated to reach 6.2 million tons by 2015.2 Eighty percentage of aniline goes to the production of
methylene diphenylene isocyanate, which is used in the manufacturing
of polyurethane.1

The mass production
of aniline demands an efficient, safe, and
economical synthesis. Although the first reported production of aniline
was in 1854 via the reduction of nitrobenzene, little improvements
in this process have been reported, and hence, nitrobenzene remains
the raw material used by almost all commercial producers of aniline.1Scheme 1 summarizes the industrial synthesis of aniline, which comprises
multiple steps. It begins with the nitration of benzene using a mixture
of nitric acid and sulfuric acid. The next step is the hydrogenation
(reduction) of the nitro group in the presence of a catalyst (Pt/Pd
on carbon or Raney Ni). Last, separation and distillation are performed
to purify aniline.1

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Aniline
Adapted from ref (1).

The conventional route of the production of aniline, although it
is practical and very exothermic, has drawbacks. It is not economical
with respect to the capital cost and to atom economy. It also consumes
a lot of energy, requires a large amount of corrosive acid catalysts
and produces acid sludges, and can be accompanied by a great amount
of by-products.2 Thus, direct chemical
synthesis of aniline is of significant interest for the development
of a more economic and environmentally friendly one-pot reaction process.

The direct route (Scheme 2) offers several advantages over the conventional process;
however, it has several challenges. The main challenge is the difficulty
in activating the strong C–H bond of benzene [bond dissociation
energy (BDE) = ∼113 kcal mol–1] and the strong
N–H bond of ammonia (∼108 kcal mol–1) simultaneously.3 Utilizing ammonia (NH3) as an aminating agent is attractive because of its low cost
and atom efficiency. Another issue associated with the direct process
is that the production of hydrogen can drive the reaction toward the
formation of benzene, which reduces the yield of aniline. Decomposition
of ammonia into N2 and H2 at high temperature
is also one of the challenges that must be inhibited to ensure a high
yield of aniline.

Scheme 2 Proposed Direct Route of the Production of Aniline
Despite several experimental
efforts,4−25 a one-pot process has not been adopted yet for commercial applications,
mostly because of low aniline yields. Most of the developments in
this field are targeted toward the determination of an effective aminating
agent, either ammonia or an ammonia derivative, in the presence of
an effective catalyst. An oxidizing agent, such as oxygen gas, metal
oxide, or hydrogen peroxide, is typically required. A significant
advance includes the use of the Ni/NiO/ZrO2 cataloreactant,19−22 to achieve direct amination of benzene to aniline. NiO is used as
a reducible oxide that can oxidize the produced hydrogen while easily
reducing to metallic Ni0. The yield of aniline from this
reaction is about 13.6% at 623 K and 300–400 atm. Hagemeyer
et al.5 conducted a large screening study
and found that Rh/Ni–Mn/K–TiO2 cataloreactant
produces the best benzene conversion and aniline selectivity. Both
Hagemeyer’s work5 and Hoffmann et
al.7,8 emphasized the importance of metallic nickel as an
active site for the formation of aniline. Hoffmann further proved
that elemental Ni is essential to activate the C–H bond of
benzene and the N–H bond of ammonia simultaneously by conducting
a temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) experiment of the direct amination
of benzene on the Ni/ZrO2 catalyst at a temperature range
of 523–873 K under standard pressure.7 Although the cataloreactant of DuPont has been shown to produce
aniline from the direct amination of benzene, no information about
the thermodynamics and the electronic properties of some of the intermediates
involved in this reaction is available.

To explore possible
reaction intermediates and to better understand
the role of nickel in direct aniline production, plane-wave density
functional theory (PW-DFT) calculations were used to study the direct
amination of benzene by a Ni(111) surface (Scheme 3). The DFT modeling of surface reactions
has demonstrated the potential for providing molecular-level understanding
of heterogeneous catalysts. Adsorption energies, structures, sites,
and thermochemical analysis of the proposed reaction pathways relevant
to the amination of benzene on the Ni(111) surface were investigated.
Ni(111) is chosen because of its stability and its efficacy toward
the adsorption of aniline.26,27 It is necessary to
examine the adsorption behavior of aniline on the Ni(111) surface
in detail, including its adsorption geometry and energy, which has
not been, to our knowledge, reported before, to get information that
can facilitate further catalyst design. This study also aims to compare
and correlate a heterogeneous Ni(111)–imide model with the
previous homogenous nickel–imide model for the C–H amination
reaction.28

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Method
Calibration
To validate the
utilized method for free molecules, the BDEs of the free molecules
in the gas phase were calculated and compared with the available experimental
data, as shown in Table 1. In addition to the calibration, these energies help to correlate
the dissociation of these molecules in the gas phase and on the Ni(111)
surface. For a molecule AB, the BDE is computed as follows: BDE =
(EA + EB)
– EAB, where EA and EB are the calculated
total energies of molecule A and molecule B, respectively, and EAB is the calculated total energy of molecule
AB. Homolytic BDE calculations often represent a challenge for DFT
owing to the difference in electron correlation between a molecule
and its fragments. Calculating the reaction energies is usually more
accurate because of the cancelation of error. Nevertheless, the calculated
BDEs shown in Table 1 generally show a very good agreement with the experimental bond
energies, especially when zero-point energy (ZPE) and thermal correction
are added. The BDEs of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)
and PBE-D3 are very similar, with the largest difference between them
being 1.1 kcal mol–1 for the C–N BDE of aniline,
which is still within the experimental uncertainty. Therefore, as
shown in Table 1, no
notable improvement in the results is found when including the dispersion-corrected
functional. From the BDE results, breaking one C–H bond of
benzene in the gas phase is very endothermic, as expected, and requires
a large amount of energy. We will show later how the use of a catalyst
can help reduce this energetic demand. The same observation is true
for the first N–H dissociation energy of ammonia and for NH2, NH, and aniline. The BDE of aniline shows that breaking
the C–N bond of aniline requires higher energy than that required
for N–H dissociation.

As the adsorption of ammonia and benzene on the Ni(111)
surface
has been studied before,31−40 their experimental adsorption energies were used to further validate
the methods used in this study. Table 2 shows the calculated adsorption energies from this
study using PBE-, PBE-D3-, ZPE-corrected adsorption energies, and
the experimental adsorption energies for adsorbed ammonia and adsorbed
benzene on the Ni(111) surface. Low-energy electron diffraction experiments31,32 and previous calculations33−35 confirmed that the nitrogen atom
in ammonia is bound directly to the Ni(111) surface, whereas the hydrogen
atoms point away from the surface, as shown in Figure 1a. The most stable adsorption site of NH3 is atop, where the nitrogen atom is bound directly to a single
Ni atom on the surface via the electron lone pair of the N atom of
ammonia. In addition, previous experiments36−38 and calculations39,40 showed that the benzene ring adsorbs parallel to the surface, with
all hydrogen atoms tilted away from the surface (Figure 1b). Our results agree well
with these previous findings. The PBE adsorption energies (shown in Table 2) are in excellent
agreement with experiments with ≤1.0 kcal mol–1 difference. When adding the ZPE correction to the PBE adsorption
energy of ammonia, the absorption energy is equal to that of the experiment,
whereas the ZPE-corrected adsorption energy of benzene becomes 3.0
kcal mol–1 lower than the experimental value. This
is still in reasonable agreement with the experiment, as the experimental
uncertainty associated with the use of temperature-programmed desorption
spectroscopy to approximate the adsorption energy of large systems
is estimated to be within 3 kcal mol–1.41,42 This demonstrates the importance of including the ZPE correction
in the calculations of the adsorption energies, and thus, the ZPE
correction is included in all adsorption energies. To examine the
effect of the van der Waals (vdW) interactions on the binding to the
metal surface, the semiempirical PBE-D3 functional was used. The computed
adsorption energies for ammonia and benzene using PBE-D3, shown in Table 2, show an overbinding
of 9 kcal mol–1 for ammonia and 38.4 kcal mol–1 for benzene, which represents the dispersion energies
that contribute to the molecule–metal binding. A large dispersion
energy of benzene on other (111) surfaces, such as Pt(111), Pd(111),
Ag(111), and Au(111), was also previously obtained using different
dispersion-corrected methods.41,43 Grimme et al.44 pointed out that DFT-D3 is a great tool to provide
accurate adsorption energies for molecules and solids, in particular
for weakly bounded systems (physisorption interactions), where dispersive
interactions are dominant. For chemisorbed molecules, for example,
all adsorbates in the present study, the interaction between a molecule
and a metal surface may not be captured in the DFT-D3 parameterization,
thereby leading to a large overbinding for the D3 corrections. DFT-D3
becomes more important when more than one molecule adsorb on the surface.
Tonigold and Groß45 examined the performance
of DFT-D3 on several water–metal systems as compared to that
of PBE and found that pure PBE adequately described the adsorption
behavior of pure water–metal system, but if additional adsorbates
were added to the surface, then DFT-D3 would have been more reliable.
Therefore, adding a dispersion correction to the molecule–Ni(111)
adsorption systems in the current study would not be expected to improve
the results relative to the experiment, which is demonstrated by the
results in Table 2.
Because the PBE adsorption energies are in excellent agreement with
the experiment, they are used later to calculate the reaction thermodynamics.

2.2 Adsorption Geometries and Energies
The first step in
surface reactions is usually the adsorption of
the species involved in the reaction on the surface. Thus, it is of
importance to study their adsorption behaviors. The adsorption behavior
of the NHx (x = 0–3)
species and the aromatic species involved in the direct amination
of benzene on the Ni(111) surface is reported and discussed here.
Geometry optimizations were performed for all adsorption systems to
find the most stable structure of the molecule–surface interaction,
that is, the most favorable surface site for each adsorption process,
which has the lowest adsorption energy. The computed adsorption energy
is defined as follows: Ead = Eadsorbate+Ni(111) – Eadsorbate – ENi(111), where Ead is the binding energy of a molecule bound to the surface, Eadsorbate+Ni(111) is the calculated total energy
of the optimized adsorption system, and Eadsorbate and ENi(111) are the calculated total
energies of the isolated molecule and of the clean surface, respectively.
As mentioned above, a ZPE correction is added to all total energies.
Only the adsorption energies of the most stable structures on the
Ni(111) surface are provided here.

2.2.1 NH3*, NH2*, NH*, N*, and
H*
2.2.1.1 Adsorption Sites and Energies
Both NH2 and NH interact with the Ni(111) surface similar
to ammonia (the same orientation), that is, via the nitrogen atom.
However, each species interacts with different active sites (see Figures 1a and 2a,b). Duan et al.33,47 studied the adsorption
sites and energies of the NHx species
on the Ni(111) surface and found that NH2 and NH interact
with the Ni(111) surface via bridge and face-centered cubic (fcc)
sites, respectively, which is consistent with our findings. Duan reported
the adsorption energies of the NHx species
in two publications.33,47 The adsorption energies are different
in those two papers. Their adsorption energies and the adsorption
energies of the current study are listed in Table 3. Duan’s study used 3 × 3 ×
1 k-points mesh, whereas in this study a higher k-point mesh (5 × 5 × 1) was used. Our results
are in very good agreement with the data provided by Duan.33 The calculated adsorption energy of ammonia
from this work is identical to the experimental value. It can be observed
from Table 3 that the
adsorption energy decreases (increasing stability) with a decrease
in the number of hydrogen atoms going from NH3 to N, as
expected, given an increase in unsaturation of nitrogen in this order.
This is evident, giving the different preferred interaction sites
from the NH3/Ni(111) system to the NH/Ni(111) system. Both
NH2/Ni(111) and NH/Ni(111) bindings involve forward donation
from the lone-pair electron of nitrogen and the back donation from
the d-electrons of the Ni atom(s). More investigations on the electronic
properties of NH/Ni(111) and NH2/Ni(111) systems will be
illustrated later. Nitride and hydride both prefer to adsorb on the
fcc site of the Ni(111) surface. Hydrogen molecules tend to always
adsorb dissociatively on the Ni(111) surface.48 Several studies on the interaction of a hydrogen atom with different
surfaces also demonstrated that the hydrogen atom prefers to interact
on the three-fold hollow site.48 The PBE-D3
adsorption energies of the NHx species
and H (see Table 3),
although overestimated, reveal the trend similar to PBE adsorption
energies, that is, they are decreasing (relatively by the same magnitude
as PBE) going from NH3 to N.

2.2.1.2 Adsorption Geometry
The predicted
gas-phase structural parameters of NH3, NH2,
and NH from this work (using PW-PBE) are in excellent agreement with
experiments (see Table 4). The predicted adsorbed structures of the NHx species agree very well with the previous calculations by
Duan et al.33 The N–Ni bond distance
in the NH3/Ni(111) system is only 0.06 Å away from
the experimentally measured distance.35 The N–H bond length in NH3 elongates by 0.004
Å when adsorbed on the Ni(111) surface, but the N–H bond
shortens by 0.01 and 0.03 Å in adsorbed NH2 and NH,
respectively. Differences in the N–H bond length can be attributed
to the different molecule–surface electronic interaction for
each system. Furthermore, the H–N–H bond angles open
by 2.0° and 2.2° in NH3 when adsorbed on the
Ni(111) surface, whereas it opens by 5.1° in adsorbed NH2. This expansion is due to the shape of NH3 and
NH2 that become more tetrahedral via adsorption. The distance
between N and Ni decreases in the direction: NH3 (2.03
Å), NH2 (1.93 Å), and NH (1.84 Å), highlighting
the strong binding of NH. In the N/Ni(111) system, the N–Ni
bonds are the shortest among other N–Ni bonds (see Table 4); therefore, when
nitrogen gets more unsaturated, it binds very tightly to the surface.
Hydride, on the other hand, greatly overlaps with the Ni atoms, resulting
in shorter H–Ni bonds compared to the N–Ni bond lengths,
but the NiHNi angles are larger than the NiNNi angles (in adsorbed
nitride) by 2.4°.

2.2.1.3 Vibrational
Frequencies
To obtain
a more complete picture of bond strengths and the structural changes
via adsorption, the vibrational frequencies of the gaseous and adsorbed
NHx species were calculated and are organized
in Table 5. The experimental
vibrational frequencies of the gas-phase NH3, NH2, and NH and of adsorbed NH3 on the Ni(111) surface are
also given in Table 5. The predicted vibrational frequencies from this work (not corrected
for anharmonicity) are in reasonable agreement with the available
experimental frequencies.53−56 When comparing the calculated frequencies in the
gas phase and in adsorption, the decrease in the vibrational modes
of NH3 via adsorption is plausible owing to the introduction
of the N–Ni binding that slightly weakens the N–H bonds.
This decrease ranges between 45 and 30 cm–1 in the
frequencies; however, only the HNH wagging mode increased by 112 cm–1 via adsorption, consistent with the enlargement of
this angle, as shown in Table 4; that is, the HNH bond angles of NH3 open by 2.0°
and 2.2° when adsorbed on the Ni(111) surface. On the other hand,
the frequencies of NH2 and NH increased upon adsorption,
confirming the finding that the N–H bonds in these molecules
become stronger when interacting with the Ni(111) surface.

2.2.2 C6H6*, C6H5*, C6H5NH2*, and C6H5NH*
2.2.2.1 Adsorption
Sites and Energies
As mentioned above, benzene adsorbs parallel
to the surface with
all hydrogen atoms tilted away with respect to the surface (Figure 1b). The calculated
adsorption energy of benzene including the ZPE correction is −21.4
kcal mol–1 (see Table 6) obtained mostly from π interactions.
The adsorption energy of phenyl on the Ni(111) surface is more stable
than that of adsorbed benzene by ∼30 kcal mol–1 (see Table 6). The
strong binding of phenyl compared to that of benzene is due to the
strong σ interaction introduced in the phenyl/Ni(111) system,
which is not present in the benzene/Ni(111) system (only π interactions),
resulting in different adsorption structures between these two systems.
The adsorption of phenyl appears tilted with respect to the surface
on the fcc site (Figure 3a), which is a stronger binding site than the bridge site (most stable
site of benzene). This adsorption orientation of phenyl was also found
by Feng et al.,57 but their adsorption
energy of phenyl using the PBE method and the slab model is lower
than ours by 92.8 kcal mol–1 mainly because a larger
surface unit (12.46 × 12.46 Å2) was used in their
study. The adsorption energy of phenyl when adsorbed nearly vertical
to the Ni(111) surface on the hexagonal close-packed site is found
to be less stable than that of the tilted phenyl by approximately
3 kcal mol–1, as the former loses some of the π
interactions (see Figure S5a). The adsorption
energy of phenyl is predicted to be higher when adsorbed vertically
on the bridge site, in which the π-electron interactions decrease
the most (Figure S5b). The vertical orientation
of phenyl may likely occur due to the few binding sites available
on the Ni(111) surface.

Previous studies of the adsorption
of aniline on nickel surfaces
showed a slightly different adsorption behavior of aniline. On evaporated
Ni films, aniline was found, using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,
to adsorb molecularly by π electrons and dissociatively as an
anion formed from losing a proton from the amino group.58 Studies by Huang and co-workers26,27 on the adsorption of aniline on the Ni(100) and the Ni(111) surfaces
using fluorescence yield near-edge spectroscopy and TPR techniques
revealed that the adsorption of aniline is a structure-sensitive reaction
and that the Ni(111) surface is considered to be the most stable for
the adsorption of aniline, where aniline does not easily undergo hydrogenolysis
and hydrogenation until reaching the temperature of ∼800 K
and higher. Huang et al.26 concluded that
aniline adsorbs on the Ni(111) surface at a small angle only via π
interactions, whereas Myers and Benziger59 suggested that aniline forms an unreactive surface polymer (polyaniline)
when adsorbed on the Ni(111) surface that is stable above 600 K. The
same polyaniline was found on the Ni(100) surface.60 In the TPR experiment of Hoffmann,7,8 aniline
was the only aromatic molecule detected below 610 K. When relaxing
the aniline/Ni(111) system starting from various initial structures,
in the current study, we found that aniline always interacts with
the Ni(111) surface not only on the bridge site via the aromatic ring
π interactions but also on the atop site via the amino group
σ interaction (see Figures 3b and 4a). The adsorption energy
of aniline is higher (less stable) than that of benzene by 0.9 kcal
mol–1, indicating a slightly weaker π interaction
between aniline and the Ni(111) surface compared to that of benzene.
In addition, nitrogen in aniline interacts slightly less strongly
with the Ni(111) surface than that in ammonia. To confirm the adsorption
structure of aniline, a large slab model (5 × 5 × 4) of
the Ni(111) surface was constructed to study the adsorption of aniline
(Figures 4b,c). The
adsorption energy of aniline on the larger supercell p(5 × 5) is −26.3 kcal mol–1, lower
(more stable) by ∼6 kcal mol–1 than that
of aniline on the smaller supercell p(3 × 3).
Aniline rotates on the large surface and adsorbs on a different kind
of the bridge site (Figure 4b), bridge site B (also known as bridge 0°), compared
to the adsorption on bridge site A (bridge 30°) on the p(3 × 3)–Ni(111) surface unit cell (Figure 4a). Aniline is found
to be unstable on the hollow sites. Thus, the most stable adsorption
orientation of aniline is predicted to be via bridge site B and atop
site. For consistency, the total energy of aniline adsorbed on p(3 × 3) is used in calculating the reaction thermodynamics.
Anilide, N(H)C6H5, observed on evaporated nickel
films,58 prefers to adsorb vertically on
the Ni(111) surface on a bridge site (see Figure 3c) with an adsorption energy that is higher
than that of vertical phenyl by 2.1 kcal mol–1 (Figure S5b), which can be attributed to the C–Ni
bond being stronger, in which the aromatic ring directly interacts
with the surface, than the N–Ni bond (the aromatic ring is
away from the surface and causes a steric effect). The shortest C–Ni
bond length in vertically adsorbed phenyl is 1.953 Å versus 1.974
Å for the N–Ni bond length in adsorbed anilide.

aniline adsorbed on the p(3 ×
3) surface unit cell of Ni(111) on bridge site A (a) and on the p(5 × 5) surface unit cell on bridge site B (b) and
a side view of aniline adsorbed on the large 5 × 5 × 4 Ni(111)
slab model (c).

Similarly to benzene,
the PBE-D3 predicts lower adsorption energies
for phenyl, aniline, and anilide in comparison to the PBE adsorption
energies. This overestimation may involve the contribution of the
vdW interactions to the molecule–metal binding, which are known
to be significant for aromatic systems (see Table 6). The dispersion energy of phenyl is very
close to that of benzene, whereas aniline has about a 5 kcal mol–1 larger dispersion energy than benzene as per the
PBE-D3 results. As anticipated, anilide has the lowest dispersion
energy among the adsorbed aromatic species because the ring is not
very close to the surface. The difference in adsorption energy between
parallel-adsorbed benzene and tilted-adsorbed phenyl is 30.0 kcal
mol–1 when using PBE and PBE-D3. Thus, PBE-D3 still
provides correct qualitative trends of the adsorption energies.

2.2.2.2 Adsorption Geometry
Important
structural parameters of the free and adsorbed aromatic species are
shown in Tables 7 and 8. A full list can be found in Tables S1 and S2. The C–C bonds in phenyl elongate,
similar to benzene, by 0.02–0.08 Å when adsorbed on the
Ni(111) surface (see Table 7), resulting in a decrease in the bond order and a degree
of molecular distortion that can also be seen from the changes in
the CCH bond angles (Table S1). The C–H
bond lengths of phenyl do not exhibit major changes via adsorption,
except that they become titled out of the plane of the aromatic ring,
as shown in Figure 3a. The C–Ni bonds in adsorbed phenyl vary in length, ranging
from 1.905 to ∼2.5 Å. The gradual increase in the C–Ni
bond lengths confirms that phenyl tilts from the surface, suggesting
that it interacts with Ni(111) in both a σ fashion (through
the short 1.905 Å bond) and π interactions with the remainder
of the ring. This contrasts with the C–Ni distances in adsorbed
benzene, which are all similar, ∼2.1 Å.

Similarly, in aniline, the C–C
bonds get longer upon the
adsorption and the ring loses some degree of unsaturation. The C–Ni
bond lengths in aniline range from 2.04 to 2.09 Å, almost similar
to adsorbed benzene, except the two Cipso–Ni bond
distances (Table 8).
The carbon atom connected to the amino group (Cipso) in
adsorbed aniline interacts with two Ni atoms (bridge sites), making
the two Cipso–Ni bond distances longer (2.585 and
2.133 Å). The perpendicular distance between the Cipso and the surface, though, is still ∼2.1 Å, as shown in Figure 3b. Thus, the aromatic
ring in aniline adsorbs parallel to the Ni(111) surface. The N–Ni
distance in adsorbed aniline is also 2.1 Å, which is similar
to the C–Ni bond lengths but longer by 0.07 Å than the
N–Ni bond length in adsorbed ammonia. This is consistent with
ammonia being a better σ donor than aniline. A steric effect
may also play a role here in hindering the N atom from binding strongly
to the Ni(111) surface. In addition, the HNH bond angle of the amino
group in adsorbed aniline also opens as that in adsorbed ammonia to
accommodate a more tetrahedral configuration about nitrogen.

In adsorbed anilide, four of the C–C bonds of the aromatic
ring (two Cipso–C bonds and the other two C–C
bonds that are parallel to them) become shorter instead of becoming
longer via adsorption in contrast to that in aniline, benzene, and
phenyl. The C–C bonds in adsorbed anilide are all longer than
those in adsorbed aniline. The C–N bond in anilide elongates
by 0.076 Å via adsorption, but it is still shorter than the C–N
bond in adsorbed aniline. The nitrogen atom in adsorbed anilide interacts
with the Ni(111) surface via bridge sites similar to that in adsorbed
amide (see Figures 1a and 3c). Because of the steric effect resulting
from
the aromatic ring in anilide, the N–Ni bonds in adsorbed anilide
are longer by 0.065 and 0.044 Å than the N−Ni bonds of
adsorbed amide. Also, the NiNCipso angle opens about 10°
larger than the NiNH angle of adsorbed amide. This can explain why
the adsorption energy of anilide is predicted to be higher than that
of amide by 24 kcal mol–1.

2.2.2.3 Vibrational Frequencies
The calculated
vibrational frequencies of C–H, C–C, N–H, and
C–N bonds of free and adsorbed benzene, phenyl, aniline, and
anilide, as well as their experimental frequencies in the gas phase
and the experimental frequencies of benzene adsorbed on the Ni(111)
surface, are given in Table 9. A full list of the calculated frequencies can be found in Table S3. The calculated gas-phase frequencies
are in good agreement with experiments, although they are not corrected
for anharmonicity. From the lower C–C bond frequencies of adsorbed
benzene, phenyl, and aniline compared to the C–C bond in the
gas phase, it is reasonable to conclude that the adsorbed C–C
bonds are not as strong as they are in the gas phase, mostly because
of their contribution to the π interactions with the Ni(111)
surface. The frequency of the C–C bond of aniline decreases
only by 59 cm–1 when adsorbed on the Ni(111) surface
compared to a 147 cm–1 decrease in the same frequency
for benzene, which supports our proposal that aniline has higher adsorption
energy than benzene because it involves weaker π interactions,
which can also be seen from the slight differences in the C–Ni
bond lengths in aniline compared to that in benzene, as mentioned
in the former section. On the other hand, the C–C stretching
frequencies of adsorbed anilide become higher by 27 cm–1 versus the gas phase, indicating a stable aromatic ring. No large
differences in the C–H stretching modes are seen between the
gas phase and the adsorbed molecules, although they become slightly
lower with adsorption. The C–H bond lengths do not change much
via adsorption but they tilt away from the surface. Similar to the
C–H stretching modes, the N–H stretching modes display
no significant differences in the frequencies between the gas phase
and the adsorbed molecules. The C–N stretching modes of aniline
and anilide exhibit a high decrease in the frequencies between free
and adsorbed molecules. Although the C–N bond becomes longer
via adsorption, aniline was found to be stable against hydrogenolysis
when adsorbed on the Ni(111) surface in the presence of hydrogen,
but at very high temperature (more than 800 K).26

2.3.1 Decomposition of Ammonia
Decomposition
of ammonia on close-packed surfaces of reactive transition metals
requires high pressure and temperature to overcome the decomposition
barrier.65 The use of NiO in DuPont’s
cataloreactant may have favored the decomposition of ammonia into
the NHx species, as Hoffmann et al.7 found that no NH3 was detected above
523 K, meaning that the Ni surface was covered with NHx species. Adsorption of ammonia on the Ni(111) surface
is an exergonic reaction but can be decomposed by increasing the heat.7 The reaction energy, enthalpies, and free energies
are shown in Table 10. Breaking two N–H bonds of ammonia to produce imide (NH3* → NH* +
2 H*) shows the lowest reaction enthalpy (−20.1 kcal mol–1), followed by breaking the N–H bond of amide
(NH2* →
NH* + H*) (−13.7 kcal mol–1) and NH3* → NH2* + H* (−6.4
kcal mol–1). Finally, the decomposition of NH* into
H* and N* displays the highest reaction enthalpy. According to the
present results, the decomposition of ammonia on the Ni(111) surface
into imide is the most favorable; thus, imide is predicted to be the
most prevalent species on the Ni(111) surface among the NHx species, although amide cannot be ruled out, while
nitride seems less likely as does undissociated ammonia, which is
consistent with the calculations of Duan of the activation energies.33 Duan found that the lowest energy barrier corresponds
to the dehydrogenation of NH2* to give NH* and H*, in which NH2* diffuses on the
surface from the moderate binding bridge site to the strong binding
fcc site. The adsorption energy of NH2 on the fcc site
is higher than that on the bridge site by 7 kcal mol–1 (see Figures S4a,b), but the imide species
bind more strongly and are more stable than amide on the fcc site
(Table 3). A recent
experimental study of the decomposition of ammonia on the closed-packed
surface Co(0001), which is anticipated to carry reactivity similar
to that of the Ni(111) surface, has found that imide is the most stable
species among the NHx species and can
be selectively produced using the electron-induced dissociation technique
at low temperature.65 Gibbs free energies
of the decomposition reactions of ammonia on the Ni(111) surface at
523 K predicted that these reactions are exergonic (except the dehydrogenation
of imide) (see Table 10), with the imide–Ni(111) being the most favorable decomposition
reaction of ammonia at this temperature. The differences between ΔH and ΔG are small as shown from the results in Table 10, indicating small
contributions from the entropies.

2.3.2 Decomposition
of Benzene
As shown
in Table 11, the decomposition
of benzene into phenyl and hydrogen on the Ni(111) surface is thermodynamically
less favorable than the adsorption of benzene on the Ni(111) surface.
This result is expected, given the difficulty in activating the C–H
bond and the high stability of the benzene ring. However, compared
to the energy required to break the C–H bond of benzene in
the gas phase (113 kcal mol–1) (Table 1), the use of the Ni(111) surface
does reduce the endothermicity of breaking the C–H bond by
∼99 kcal mol–1. These results lead to the
conclusion that benzene is more stable on the Ni(111) surface than
phenyl and that the C–H bond can be possibly activated at high
temperature.

2.4 Production of Aniline
Hoffmann et
al.7 represented a kinetic study of the
semibatch oxidative synthesis of aniline catalyzed by NiO/ZrO2 and found that temperature is a critical parameter to move
the reaction forward. Full coverage of the NHx species on the Ni surface is also required for the formation
of aniline so that it can control the adsorption geometry of benzene
on the nickel surface.7,8 Hoffmann suggested that an adsorbed
phenyl-type intermediate would be possible for this process, yet no
confirmation of this proposal has been provided. In this section,
possible reaction pathways between imide and benzene, because they
are likely the most prevalent (stable) species on the surface, are
proposed and investigated based on their reaction enthalpies and reaction
free energies at 523 K. Surface reactions generally go through a catalytic
cycle comprising elementary steps, beginning with adsorption, then
reaction, and finally desorption. Two mechanisms common in surface
reactions are the Langmuir–Hinshelwood and Rideal–Eley
mechanisms.

2.4.1 Langmuir–Hinshelwood Mechanism
In this mechanism, all reactants involved in the reaction are adsorbed
on the surface before reacting. Under this scheme, two reaction processes
for aniline production were proposed: insertion and stepwise (see Table 12 and Scheme 5). The first reaction pathway entails direct insertion of the imide
into the C–H bond of adsorbed benzene, generating new C–N
and N–H bonds, and thus, aniline is coordinated. Then, aniline
is desorbed. The overall reaction is endergonic and must be aided
with heat and/or pressure, as it is also endothermic by 21.5 kcal
mol–1 at 523 K.

a * indicates an adsorbed molecule.

The second reaction pathway modeled
is a stepwise formation of
the C–N and N–H bonds. The first step proceeds by a
C–H bond activation, in which a C–H bond of benzene
breaks and a Ni–C bond forms, resulting in C6H5/Ni(111) and NH2/Ni(111). These two species react
in the second exothermic step akin to a C–N formation process
to produce aniline that would then be desorbed from the Ni(111) surface.
The overall process is, of course, also endothermic by ∼21.4
kcal mol–1 at 523 K, but the calculations are interesting
in that they suggest that the initial C–H activation step is
disfavored (ΔH = 24.5 kcal mol–1) relative to the second C–N formation step (ΔH = −3.1 kcal mol–1). The uphill
nature of the first step is consistent with the dehydrogenation of
benzene on the Ni(111) surface being unfeasible, as shown earlier.
In part, this disfavorability of the first step can be attributed
to the loss of some of the π interactions between the aromatic
ring and the surface in phenyl as compared to that in the adsorbed
benzene (Figures 1b
and 3a). The ΔG of this
reaction also favors the second step over the C–H bond activation
of benzene, indicating that the formation of aniline is more entropically
favored than the formation of phenyl.

2.4.2 Rideal–Eley
Mechanism
In
this reaction, not all reactants are needed to be adsorbed prior to
the reaction. It is possible that a gas-phase reactant collides with
a preadsorbed molecule on the surface. In the third modeled reaction
pathway, benzene is introduced to a preadsorbed imide on the Ni(111)
surface to produce H/Ni(111) and N(H)C6H5/Ni(111),
bound anilide, in which the aromatic ring is nearly perpendicular
to the surface and bound to the Ni(111) surface via a N atom. A coupling
between NHC6H5 and H is followed to produce
aniline. The first step in this reaction pathway is more thermodynamically
favorable (slightly exothermic) than the first step in the second
reaction pathway (C–H activation/C–N formation reaction)
(see Scheme 5). The
computed difference between these steps is 27.1 kcal mol–1, favoring the production of anilide. Another reason for the production
of surface-bound anilide/hydride being more favored than the amide/phenyl
is the existence of hydrogen that adsorbs strongly to the Ni(111)
surface (−64.5 kcal mol–1, Table 3). Both steps in this reaction
are exergonic processes, indicating that binding via nitrogen is entropically
favored. This reaction pathway is highly likely to achieve the direct
production of aniline, although high temperatures are needed for the
desorption reaction.

2.5 Desorption of Aniline
Desorption
of aniline is calculated to cost 25.1 kcal mol–1 thermal energy at 523 K, as shown in Table 13. Thus, heat is needed to overcome this
barrier. Because the desorption reaction involves an increase in entropy
owing to the conversion from being surface-bound to gas-phase aniline,
the enthalpy barrier must be overcome for this reaction to proceed.

2.6 Density
of States
To interpret the
electronic structure of the NH/Ni(111) and NH2/Ni(111)
systems, the density of states (DOS) of these systems and of the clean
Ni(111) surface were calculated. Furthermore, the local density of
state (LDOS) was also calculated for the N atom in the isolated molecules
and in the adsorption systems. The LDOS for the Ni atom interacting
with the N atom in the adsorption system was also calculated. Because
the findings of the DOS and LDOS for the NH2/Ni(111) and
NH/Ni(111) systems are similar, only the results of the later will
be discussed. The results of the DOS and the LDOS of the NH2/Ni(111) system are shown in Figure S6.

Figure 5a,b
shows the LDOS of the N atom in the isolated NH and NH/Ni(111) systems.
Each LDOS shows the contributions from s, p, and d bands in the electronic
structure. Figure 5c,d shows the DOS of the clean Ni(111) surface and the LDOS of one
of the Ni atoms that interact with NH. The Fermi level is set to 0
eV; hence, all energies are relative to the Fermi energy, Ef, which represents the energy of the highest
occupied electronic state.

Figure 5 LDOS of N in NH (a) and N (b) and Ni (d) in
the NH/Ni(111) system
and the DOS of clean Ni(111) surface (c).

By comparing between Figure 5a and Figure 5b, it can be clearly seen that the two bands at −13
and −10.5
eV in the isolated molecule have shifted via adsorption. The band
at −13 eV corresponds to the 2σ states (bonding) from
the N atom in NH, whereas the band at −10.5 eV corresponds
to the 3σ states (lone pair) from the N atom in NH. When NH
adsorbs on the Ni(111) surface, the bonding band shifts away from
the Fermi level (−16 eV), whereas the lone-pair band shifts
toward the Fermi level (−8 eV). Therefore, the N bonding state
does not contribute to the NH-surface bonding, whereas the N lone-pair
state contributes to the bonding with the
surface. In addition, the valence bands between −2 eV and the
Fermi level in the isolated NH lose their density and smear out via
adsorption. These bands represent the 1π states of the N atom
(two unpaired electrons) and the 3σ states of NH (in the triplet
state). These states involve most of the NH-surface bonding character.

On the other hand, Figure 5d shows that the adsorption induces short and narrow bands
at about −16 and −8 eV in the LDOS of the Ni atom in
the adsorption system as compared to Figure 5c [the free Ni(111) surface]. These bands
correspond to the N atom in the adsorbed NH [bonding states (−16
eV) and lone-pair states (−8 eV)]. The 1π states of the
N atom are also shown at −5 eV, indicating that they are populated
when interacting with the nickel surface. Figure 5d shows that the valence band is dominated
by d states from Ni atoms. Therefore, the NH-surface bonding (the
valence band) is a mixture of d states of the Ni atom, lone pair states
of the N atom, and 1π states to which the d states contribute
the most.

From the spin density plot, shown in Figure 6, the spin-up and spin-down
densities of
the N atom are very similar. This leads to the conclusion that NH
interacts with the surface more as an imide (singlet NH2–) rather than as an imidyl (doublet NH•–) radical anion or as a nitrene (triplet NH••) radical.
NH2 also interacts with the surface as an amide (NH2–) rather than as an aminyl (NH2•) radical
via analysis of its spin-up and spin-down densities (see Figure S7). Furthermore, from our calculations,
anilide is found to adsorb in a way similar to that of amide based
on its adsorption structure and vibration; thus, one may surmise that
anilide interacts with the surface as an anion (C6H5(H)N–) rather than as anilinyl (C6H5(H)N•).

Figure 6 Spin density of the NH/Ni(111) system.

The electronic properties of imide
on the heterogeneous Ni(111)
surface are thus quite different from the electronic states of a homogeneous
imide–nickel model,28 where imide
interacts as an imidyl (NR•–) radical anion
(R = hydrocarbyl substituent). These electronic states may allow homogeneous
imide systems to undergo hydrogen atom abstraction reactions that
are disfavored in heterogeneous models.

3 Conclusions
This study presents an initial step toward understanding and identifying
relevant species involved in the direct amination of benzene using
first principles density functional calculations. Calculations predict
that aniline adsorbs parallel to the surface via the aromatic ring
and the nitrogen atom. The adsorption energy of aniline is higher
(less stable) than that of benzene, indicating a weaker π interaction
with the surface. Among all species, imide (NH) and benzene are predicted
to be the most stable on the Ni(111) surface. The DOS calculations
predict that NH interacts with the surface as an imide (NH2–) and NH2 interacts with the surface as an amide (NH2–), and hence they are quite different from
molecular analogues that have more radical character in the ligands.
Three reaction pathways were proposed relevant to the direct amination
of benzene on the Ni(111) surface, and on the basis of the thermodynamics,
the reaction involves producing a surface-bound anilide, and then
coupling between NHC6H5 and H on the Ni(111)
surface seems most likely to produce aniline than the other reaction
pathways. Anilide adsorbs vertically on the Ni(111) surface in a way
similar to that of an amide; thus, one may surmise that anilide interacts
with the surface as an anion (C6H5(H)N–). More detailed conclusions about the catalytic potential of the
Ni(111) surface for the direct amination of benzene cannot be drawn
at this stage until the kinetic study of the transition states, coverage,
and activation energies is completed.

4 Computational
Details
4.1 Methods
All calculations were carried
out using PW-DFT as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio simulation
package.66−69 The electron exchange and correlation energies were addressed using
the generalized gradient approximation as proposed by Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(GGA-PBE).70,71 The electron–ion interactions
were described using the projector augmented-wave method,72,73 in which the inner core electrons are treated with pseudopotentials,
whereas valence electrons are described by a plane-wave basis set.
To examine the effect of vdW interactions on the adsorption energy,
the dispersion-corrected DFT-D344 approach
was used in this study. To obtain accurate energies, convergence tests
were run to ensure the optimal setting parameters of our calculations
(see Figures S1–S3). Plane-wave
basis sets were expanded within a 400 eV energy cutoff, the Brillouin
zone was integrated using 5 × 5 × 1 k-point
mesh for adsorption systems, and only the gamma point was used for
gas-phase molecules. Because Ni has magnetic properties, spin polarization
was considered for open-shell molecules and for all adsorption systems
to ensure accurate adsorption energies, as recommended by Kresse and
Hafner.48 The energy criterion for electronic
minimization was 10–6 eV, and the ions were allowed
to relax until all atomic forces were less than 0.02 eV/Å. The
Methfessel–Paxton smearing method74 was used with σ = 0.2 eV. All calculations were performed
at 0 K. Vibrational frequencies were calculated using a 600 eV energy
cutoff at the gamma k-point, and the force convergence
criterion was tightened to be less than 10–5 eV/Å.
For adsorbed systems, only the adsorbate and the topmost layer were
relaxed during the vibrational frequency calculations. The ZPE correction
that was added to all adsorption energies is calculated as follows 1  where vi is the calculated real frequency of a system, n is the number of vibrations, and h is Planck’s
constant. Vibrational assignments were made by animating the different
vibrational modes and seeing which atoms moved. The assigned vibration
was then compared with the available experimental assignments. For
the electronic DOS calculations, the k-point grid
was increased to 9 × 9 × 1.

4.2 Surface
Model
The DFT-optimized lattice
constant of Ni used to build the slab is 3.52 Å (see Figure S1), which agrees well with the experimental
lattice constant of Ni, 3.524 Å.75 The Ni(111) surface was modeled as a five-layer periodic slab in
the (111) Miller plane, as shown in Scheme 4. A vacuum thickness of 10 Å along the c axis was employed between repeated slabs. During the geometry
optimization, the top three layers were relaxed and the bottom two
layers were kept fixed. The total number of nickel atoms in a slab
is 45 atoms per unit cell, and the surface unit cell is p(3 × 3). One molecule was adsorbed for each calculation.

4.3 Thermochemistry
As mentioned in Hoffmann’s
study,7 the reaction temperature plays
a critical role in the selectivity of aniline in the direct amination
of benzene. DuPont’s direct synthesis reaction was conducted
at 623 K and 300–400 atm.21 In an
attempt to reduce the pressure needed, Hoffmann carried out a TPR
experiment of the direct amination of benzene with a pre-reduced Ni/ZrO2 as a catalyst at ambient pressure and temperature range 523–873
K.7 The onset formation of aniline was
detected at temperatures lower than 600 K. Thus, to obtain realistic
thermodynamics of the direct amination of benzene on the Ni(111) surface,
statistical thermodynamics using the vibrational partition function
were utilized to calculate the Gibbs free energies at 523 K as follows 2  where H(T) is the enthalpy of the system, calculated as 3  where Etotal is
the total energy of the system determined by DFT calculations, ZPE
is the ZPE correction, calculated as shown in eq 1, and Hcorr is
the thermal correction from 0 to 523 K and is calculated as 4  where kB is Boltzmann’s
constant.

Because all molecules in this study are strongly bound
to the Ni(111) surface, the translational and rotational modes are
frustrated and replaced by vibrational modes, as suggested by Blaylock
et al.76 The entropy correction to the
energy of adsorbates S (eq 2) includes the contribution only from the
vibrational modes, and it takes the form 5  For gaseous molecules, the contributions from
the transitional and rotational modes are included within the thermal
correction and entropy.
