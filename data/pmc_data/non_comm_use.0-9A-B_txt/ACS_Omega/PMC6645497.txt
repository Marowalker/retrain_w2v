(Imido)vanadium(V) dichloride complexes
containing 2-(2′-benzimidazolyl)-6-methylpyridine
ligand (L) of type V(NR)Cl2(L) [R = 1-adamantyl (Ad, 1), C6H5 (2), and 2,6-Me2C6H3 (3)] have been prepared,
and their structures were determined by X-ray crystallography as distorted
trigonal bipyramidal structures around vanadium. Reactions with ethylene
using 1–3 in the presence of methylaluminoxane
(MAO) afforded a mixture of oligomer and polymers, and the compositions
were affected by the imido ligand employed. By contrast, 1–3 exhibited remarkable catalytic activities for ethylene polymerization
in the presence of Me2AlCl; the phenylimido complex (2) exhibited the highest activity [80 100 kg-PE/mol-V·h
turn over frequency (TOF, 2 850 000 h–1, 792 s–1)]. The ethylene copolymerizations with
norbornene afforded ultrahigh-molecular-weight copolymers with uniform
molecular weight distributions and compositions [e.g., Mn = 1.71–2.66 × 106, Mw/Mn = 2.27–2.53].
On the basis of V nuclear magnetic resonance (51V NMR),
electron spin resonance, and V K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure
(XANES) spectra of the catalyst solution, the observed difference
in the catalyst performance in the presence of (between) MAO and Me2AlCl cocatalyst should be due to the formation of different
catalytically active species with different oxidation states. Apparent
changes in the oxidation state were observed in the (especially in
the NMR and XANES) spectra upon addition of Me2AlCl, whereas
no significant changes in the spectra were observed in presence of
MAO.

1 Introduction
Metal-catalyzed
olefin polymerization/oligomerization is one of
the key reactions in the chemical industry, and design of efficient
molecular catalysts has been considered as an important subject.1−33 Because of the attractive characteristics (notable reactivity toward
olefins) displayed by the classical Ziegler-type vanadium catalyst
systems [V(acac)3, VOCl3 and Et2AlCl,
EtAlCl2, nBuLi, etc.; employed
as catalysts for production of EPDM (synthetic rubber) etc.],24,34−45 development of efficient vanadium complex catalysts is considered
to be an attractive and important subject.24,42−45 It has been reported that (imido)vanadium(V) complexes containing
the anionic ancillary donor ligand (aryloxo,46−49 imidazolidin-2-iminato,50 etc.)24,42−50 and the chelate anionic donor ligand,51−58 as shown in Chart 1, exhibit promising catalyst behaviors in the presence of the Al
cocatalyst.59−64 In the reaction with ethylene using the chelate (2-anilidomethyl)pyridine
analogues,52,54−58 V(NR)Cl2[2-ArNCH2(C5H4N)] [R = 1-adamantyl (Ad), C6H5, Ar(2,6-Me2C6H3), etc.], a steric
bulk in the imido ligand affects the reactivity (dimerization vs polymerization)
in the presence of methylaluminoxane (MAO) cocatalyst.52,54,56 For instance, adamantylimido/phenylimido
complexes exhibited both high catalytic activity and selectivity in
ethylene dimerization,54 whereas the 2,6-Me2C6H3 analogue afforded polyethylene
under the same conditions.52 Moreover,
on the basis of recent results in the reaction chemistry (of the dimethyl
and the cationic methyl, etc.), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and
electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy
(XAS) analysis of the catalyst solution, it has been postulated that
the catalytically active species in this catalysis should be the cationic
vanadium(V) alkyl species preserving the basic ligand frameworks [imido,
(2-anilidomethyl)pyridine].58

As described above, it has been
suggested that a steric environment
around vanadium plays a role for the reaction pathway (dimerization
vs polymerization). Therefore, it could be assumed that use of the
2-(2′-benzimidazolyl)pyridine [or 2-(2′-pyridyl)benzimidazole]
ligand65,66 would provide more open space around vanadium
compared to the reported 2-(anilidomethyl)pyridine ligand (Chart 2, 1–3) because the ligand would construct a plane consisting of vanadium,
three nitrogen (imido, pyridine, and benzimidazolyl ligands; marked
with red), and the aromatic ring, which could be perpendicular to
a plane consisting of two chloride and vanadium (and nitrogen) in
the trigonal bipyramidal structure, as also demonstrated later in
the text by their structural analyses. This should be a unique contrast
to that in the 2-(anilidomethyl)pyridine ligand (4),52,54−58 in which the phenyl group connected to the nitrogen forms a plane
(marked with blue, Chart 2) parallel to the plane consisting of two Cl atoms and nitrogen
on the anilide ligand. It might be thus assumed that the structure
would facilitate the β-hydrogen elimination after olefin insertion.52,54,56 In this paper, we thus prepared
a series of (imido)vanadium(V) dichloride complexes containing 2-(2′-benzimidazolyl)-6-methylpyridine
ligands and explored their catalyst performances in the reaction of
ethylene in the presence of the Al cocatalyst. As we observed a unique
effect of Al cocatalysts (MAO vs Me2AlCl) toward the activity
and product distribution, we further explored more details in these
catalyses by NMR and ESR spectra and XAS analysis.

2.1 Synthesis and Structural
Analysis of (Imido)vanadium(V)
Dichloride Complexes Containing 2-(2′-Benzimidazolyl)-6-methylpyridine
Ligand
Three (imido)vanadium(V) dichloride complexes containing
the 2-(2′-benzimidazolyl)-6-methylpyridine ligand (L) could
be prepared from the corresponding trichloride complexes, V(NR)Cl3 [R = 1-adamantyl (Ad),67 C6H5,54 2,6-Me2C6H3 (Ar),68 in
toluene by treating the ligand potassium salts (LKs), which were prepared
in advance by treatment of 2-(2′-benzimidazole)-6-methylpyridine
(LH)69 with KH in tetrahydrofuran (THF).
This is a somewhat analogous procedure for the synthesis of titanium(IV)
dichloride complexes containing the same ligands,65,66 although the syntheses were conducted in THF using the sodium salts.
Resultant complexes were purified by recrystallization from the chilled
dichloromethane solution layered by n-hexane. The
isolated complexes were identified as V(NR)Cl2(L) [R =
Ad (1), phenyl (2), and Ar (3); L = 2-(2′-benzimidazolyl)-6-methylpyridine] by NMR spectra
and elemental analysis (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of (Imido)vanadium(V) Dichloride Complexes
Containing 2-(2′-Benzimidazolyl)-6-methylpyridine
Ligand (1–3)
However, attempted reactions of V(NAr)Cl3 with
2-(2′-benzimidazolyl)pyridine70 conducted
under the same conditions failed,
affording a mixture of several complexes, which seemed difficult to
separate on the basis of 51V NMR spectra of the reaction
mixture [Figure S1, monitored the time
course; additional experiments for the synthesis of 2-(2′-benzimidazolyl)-pyridine
and attempted reactions with V(N-2,6-Me2C6H3)Cl3 are shown in the Supporting Information]. Therefore, we could not isolate the desired (methyl-free)
complexes at this moment.

Figure 1 shows the
Oak Ridge thermal ellipsoid plot (ORTEP) drawings for complexes 1–3, and the selected bond distances and angles are
summarized in Table 1 (structure reports and xyz files for complexes 1–3 are shown in the Supporting Information). Both the adamantylimido complex (1) and the phenylimido
complex (2) fold a distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry
around vanadium, with the nitrogen on pyridyl of the bidentate ligand
(L) and the nitrogen atom in the imido ligand lying on the axis, and
an equatorial plane consisted of two chloride ligands and the N atom
in L. The axial N(1)–V–N(2) bond angles in 1 and 2 [178.37(8) and 179.1(2)°, respectively]
are larger than that in the reported 2-(anilidomethyl)pyridine complex,
V(NAd)Cl2[2-ArNCH2(C5H4N)] (4) [174.90(4)°],54 and the total bond angles of the equatorial Cl(1)–V–N(3)
and Cl(2)–V–N(3) and Cl(1)–V–Cl(2) are
355.55 and 356.21° for 1 and 2, respectively.
These results clearly suggest that the nitrogen atoms in the pyridine
ligand locate at the trans position of the imido ligand. The vanadium–imido
bond distances in 1 and 2 [V–N(1):
1.647(2) and 1.651(4) Å, respectively] are apparently shorter
than the V–N bond distances in L [V–N(3): 1.918(2) and
1.896(5) Å, respectively] and those in the pyridine ligand [V–N(2):
2.279(2) and 2.264(5) Å, respectively]. These results also indicate
that three nitrogen atoms coordinate with vanadium in different fashions.
Moreover, the V–N bond distances in the pyridine ligand [1 and 2: V–N(2): 2.279(2) and 2.264(5)
Å, respectively] are slightly longer than that in 4 [2.2241(11) Å]54 but apparently
shorter that those in the (1-adamantylimido)vanadium(V) dichloride
complexes with 2- or 8-(anilidomethyl)quinoline ligands [2.2911(14)
and 2.3338(18) Å, respectively].56

The V–N(1)–C (in the imido ligand) bond
angles in 1 and 2 [162.03(18) and 168.3(4)°]
are apparently
smaller than that in 4 [170.94(10)°],54 and the Cl(1)–V–N(1) and Cl(2)–V–N(1)
bond angles [1: 96.12(7)° and 94.06(7)°; 2: 94.9(2)° and 95.16(17)°] are also slightly smaller
than those in 4 [98.90(3)° and 96.02(4)°].54 The imido substituents are slightly bent toward
the chloride ligands, probably due to a steric influence of the phenyl
group in the benzimidazolyl ligand. These Cl(1)–V–N(1)
and Cl(2)–V–N(1) bond angles are larger than the Cl(1)–V–N(2)
and Cl(2)–V–N(2) angles [1: 85.20(5)°
and 84.40(5)°; 2: 85.38(15)° and 85.31(13)°],
which are similar to those in 4 [85.49(3)° and 83.93(3)°].54

It turned out that the mean deviations
in the plane consisting
of vanadium, imido nitrogen, and three nitrogens in the 2-(2′-benzimidazolyl)-6-methylpyridine
ligand including aromatic rings in 1–3 are 0.0315,
0.0234, and 0.00965 Å, respectively. The results thus clearly
indicate that these ligand frames possessed a plane perpendicular
to a plane consisting of two chlorine and vanadium atoms [dihedral
angles in 1: 90.053° and 2: 89.298°],
as observed previously in the related titanium complexes,65,66 although the dihedral angle in 3 is somewhat low [86.682°]
due to a steric bulk, as described below. The results also indicate
that these complexes provide more open space for the catalytic reaction
compared to the reported 2-(anilidomethyl)pyridine complex (4).54

The 2,6-dimethylphenylimido
analogue (3) also folds
a distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry around vanadium, as observed
in 1 and 2. Probably because of a steric
bulk in the two methyl groups in the imido ligand (Figure 1), the N(1)–V–N(2)
bond angle [171.1(3)°] is apparently smaller than those in the
others [178.37(8) and 179.1(2)°, for 1 and 2, respectively], and the V–N(1) bond distance [1.679(6)
Å] is longer than those in others [1.647(2) and 1.651(4) Å,
for 1 and 2, respectively]. Moreover, the
Cl(1)–V–N(1) and Cl(1)–V–N(2) bond angles
[101.6(2) and 87.35(16)°, respectively] are apparently larger
than the Cl(2)–V–N(1) and Cl(2)–V–N(2)
bond angles [91.1(2)° and 83.59(16), respectively]. Similarly,
the Cl(1)–V–N(3) bond angle [112.02(19)°] is smaller
than the Cl(2)–V–N(3) bond angle [118.78(19)°],
and the V–Cl(2) distance [2.266(2) Å] is apparently longer
than that in V–Cl(1) [2.240(2) Å]. These would be due
to a steric bulk (the phenyl substituent in the imido ligand is bent).

2.2 Reaction with Ethylene in the Presence of
Al Cocatalysts
Reactions with ethylene using V(NR)Cl2(L) [R = Ad (1), C6H5 (2), and 2,6-Me2C6H3 (3)] were conducted in toluene at 25 °C in the presence
of the Al cocatalyst [Me2AlCl or the methylaluminoxane
white solid prepared by removing toluene and AlMe3 from
the commercially available sample, TMAO, 9.5 wt % (Al) toluene solution,
Tosoh Finechem Co.].57 The results are
summarized in Tables 2 and 3.

oligomers [CHCl3 extracted portion (that could not be measured
by GC) after pouring the reaction solution into a mixture consisting
of MeOH and HCl aqueous solutions and removal of volatiles] and polyethylene.
Although the activities [and turn over frequency (TOF) values] by
the 1–MAO catalyst system were affected by the
Al/V molar ratio employed (runs 1–5), significant differences
in the compositions by varying the ratio were not observed. The resultant
polymers isolated (MeOH insoluble fraction) were insoluble in ordinary
high-temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis (conducted
in o-dichlorobenzene at 140 °C), which suggest
a possibility of obtainment of polymers with an ultrahigh molecular
weight.47−50,55,56 These results thus assume that at least two catalytically active
species play roles (yielding oligomers and ultrahigh-molecular-weight
polymer) in the reaction mixture.

It also turned out that the
reactions by the V(NAr)Cl2(L) (3)–MAO
catalyst system afforded polymers
that were insoluble for ordinary GPC analysis in addition to small
amount of oligomers (runs 9 and 10); this is the same observation
in the reaction using the 2-(anilidomethyl)pyridine analogue, V(NAr)Cl2[2-ArNCH2(C5H4N)].52 The phenylimido analogue (2) exhibited
the lowest activity affording a mixture of the polymer and oligomer
(run 8), whereas another phenylimido analogue, V(NC6H5)Cl2[2-ArNCH2(C5H4N)], showed higher activity than the 2,6-arylimido analogue in the
reaction with ethylene under similar conditions.52,54 The ratio of oligomer/polymer (composition) was thus affected by
the imido ligand employed in these catalyses.

It should be noted
that the reaction by the adamantylimido analogue
(1) exhibited a remarkably high catalytic activity for
ethylene polymerization in the presence of the Me2AlCl
cocatalyst (runs 6 and 7, Table 2), and the amount of oligomers (should be detected
by GC or extracted with CHCl3 from the reaction solution)
formed were negligible. Noteworthy, the activities by 1 in the presence of Me2AlCl were much higher than those
in the presence of MAO. Moreover, the activities by 1 (9320 and 9790 kg-PE/mol-V·h, runs 6 and 7) were higher than
that by V(NAd)Cl2[2-ArNCH2(C5H4N)] (4, e.g., 704 kg-PE/mol-V·h)55 conducted under similar conditions. Although
it has often been observed in ethylene polymerization and ethylene/propylene
copolymerization using (especially, classical Ziegler-type) vanadium
catalysts that the use of halogenated Al alkyls is more effective
than MAO,24,42−50 the present catalyst systems exhibited remarkably high catalytic
activities compared to the reported systems (shown in Table 3).

Table 3 summarizes
the results of ethylene polymerization by 1–3 in
the presence of the Me2AlCl cocatalyst. These reactions
afforded polymers exclusively, which were insoluble for the ordinary
GPC analysis (in o-dichlorobenzene at 140 °C),
suggesting a possibility of formation of ultrahigh-molecular-weight
polymers (as also suggested from the copolymerization results with
norbornene (NBE), shown below in Table 4).47−50,55,56 Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermogram in the resultant
polymer possesses a melting temperature at 136 °C (sample run
15, shown in the Supporting Information), strongly suggesting that the resultant polymers are linear polyethylene.
Attempts for reactions with ethylene by 1 in the presence
of AliBu3 (1, 0.05
μmol, Al/V = 1000, molar ratio, in toluene, ethylene 8 atm for
10 min) afforded negligible amounts of polymers/oligomers. Moreover,
attempts for reactions with ethylene by 2 in the presence
of AlEt3 or AliBu3 afforded a negligible amount of polymers/oligomers (runs 25–28), and the activities by 2 in the presence of Et2AlCl (in place of Me2AlCl) were rather low (runs 22–24).

It turned out that the activities by V(NR)Cl2(L)–Me2AlCl catalysts were affected by the Al/V molar ratio employed,
and the activity under the optimized conditions increased in the order 3 (R = 2,6-Me2C6H3, 35 700
kg-PE/mol-V·h, run 32) < 1 (R = Ad, 55 700,
run 15) < 2 (R = C6H5, 80 100,
run 20). The phenylimido analogue (2) exhibited the highest
activities, and the activity [80 100 kg-PE/mol-V·h (TOF
2 850 000 h–1, 792 s–1)] is higher than those by V(N-2,6-Cl2C6H3)Cl2(OAr)–Et2AlCl (55 800
kg-PE/mol-V·h)49 and V(NAr)Cl2(OAr)–iBu2AlCl
catalyst systems (64 800 kg-PE/mol-V·h),48 which are known to exhibit the highest activities in toluene
among the reported aryloxo-modified (imido)vanadium dichloride complex
catalysts. It would be interesting to note that the activity by the
adamantylimido analogue (1) increased upon the addition
of Cl3CCO2Et (ETA) that has been known as an
effective promoter (reoxidants, for the reactivation of the assumed
catalytically active species),24,42−44,71 whereas a similar effect was
not observed in ethylene polymerization using the V(NAr)Cl2(OAr)–Et2AlCl catalyst system.48

Copolymerizations of ethylene with various cyclic
olefins [NBE,
tetracyclododecene (TCD), cyclopentene (CPE), and cyclohexene (CHE)]
were conducted in the presence of the V(NC6H5)Cl2(L) (2)–Me2AlCl catalyst
system in toluene at 25 °C. This is because the aryloxo-modified
(imido)vanadium complexes, exemplified as V(NAr)Cl2(OAr),
exhibited both high catalytic activities and efficient NBE incorporation
in the ethylene/NBE copolymerization,47−49 and the resultant cyclic
olefin copolymers are promising materials with a high thermal resistance
[glass transition temperature (Tg)], transparency
with low water absorption, and so forth.72−76 The results are summarized in Table 4. Selected 13C NMR spectrum (Figure S3) and DSC thermograms (Figure S4) in the resultant polymers are shown in the Supporting Information.

It was revealed
that the copolymerizations with NBE afforded ultrahigh-molecular-weight
polymers with unimodal molecular weight distributions (e.g., Mn = 1.71–2.66 × 106, Mw/Mn = 2.27–2.53,
runs 34–38). The activity was affected by the Al/V molar ratio
and the NBE concentration employed, and the activity seemed to decrease
upon increasing the NBE concentration. This is consistent with the
fact that the activity in the copolymerization became low compared
with that in the ethylene homopolymerization [e.g., activity: 23 700
kg-polymer/mol-V·h (run 38) vs 80 100 kg-PE/mol-V·h
(run 20)]. The Mn values in the copolymer
increased upon increasing the NBE contents (runs 34–38 vs 43
and 44), and the Mn values were not affected
by the Al/V molar ratio. As observed in the ethylene polymerization,24,42−44,71 the activities increased
upon addition of ETA, affording ultrahigh-molecular-weight copolymers
(runs 35–37). The resultant polymers possessed uniform molecular
weight distributions (as described above, measured by GPC in o-dichlorobenzene at 140 °C) and compositions confirmed
by DSC thermograms (single melting temperature, glass transition temperature, Figure S4). These results clearly suggest that
the polymerization proceeded with uniform catalytically active species.

Figure S3 shows the selected 13C NMR spectrum in the resultant poly(ethylene-co-NBE) (in 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane-d2 at 110 °C). All resonances could be assigned according to the
previous reports,73,74,77,78 and the resultant polymer possessed microstructures
corresponding to the isolated NBE incorporations in addition to the
alternating NBE incorporations to a small extent. The attempted measurement
of samples prepared under a high NBE concentration failed (because
of poor solubility for measurement of the NMR spectrum because of
ultrahigh-molecular-weight). The NBE content (8.5 mol %) estimated
by the NMR spectrum is close to that conducted by the aryloxo analogue
under similar conditions,47−49 demonstrating that the present
catalyst (2) exhibited a similar copolymerization ability.
Moreover, both the melting temperature and glass transition temperature
observed by DSC thermograms (especially, samples in runs 43 and 44,
shown in the Supporting Information, Figure
S4) well-corresponded to those in the samples with the same NBE content
prepared by the reported catalysts.73,74,77,78 The results thus strongly
suggest that the resultant polymers are copolymers with random NBE
incorporations.

Although the 2–Me2AlCl catalyst
system gave poly(ethylene-co-NBE)s, attempted ethylene
copolymerizations with TCD afforded a negligible amount of polymers
(runs 45 and 46). Attempted copolymerizations with CPE and CHE conducted
under a low ethylene pressure (2 atm) with a high comonomer concentration
(5.0 M) afforded trace amount of polymers (runs 47 and 48) or a small
amount of polyethylene (confirmed by the DSC thermogram, run 49, Figure S4).

2.3 Analysis
of the Catalyst Solution Consisting
of V(NAd)Cl2(L) (1) and Al Cocatalysts in
Toluene by NMR, ESR, and Solution-Phase XAS
51V NMR spectra of toluene-d8 solution
containing V(NAd)Cl2(L) [1, L = 2-(2′-benzimidazolyl)-6-methylpyridine]
and MAO or Me2AlCl (10 equiv) were measured at 25 °C,
and the results are shown in Figure S2 (Supporting Information). It was revealed that a resonance ascribed to 1 at −87.0 ppm disappeared upon addition of Me2AlCl (Figure S2c), whereas no significant
changes in the spectrum was observed upon addition of MAO (Figure S2b). As the disappearance of resonance
upon addition of Me2AlCl suggests a possibility of formation
of certain paramagnetic species, ESR spectra of similar solutions
consisting of 1 and MAO or Me2AlCl were measured
(Figure 2).55,79−83

Figure 2 ESR
spectra (in toluene at 25 °C, vanadium 2.5 μmol/mL)
for (a–c) V(NAd)Cl2(L) [1, L = 2-(2′-benzimidazolyl)-6-methylpyridine]
upon addition of Al cocatalyst (10 equiv) and (d) V(NAd)Cl2[N(H)Me2]2.

It was revealed that no significant differences (no resonances
ascribed to the formation of paramagnetic species) in the spectrum
were observed when a toluene solution of 1 was added
to MAO (10.0 equiv, Figure 2b). By contrast, resonances ascribed to the formation of a
paramagnetic species were observed upon addition of Me2AlCl (10.0 equiv, Figure 2c). However, the intensity was low compared to that of the
(imido)vanadium(IV) analogue, V(NAd)Cl2[N(H)Me2]280 (Figure 2d), under the same conditions. This would
suggest that the percentage of ESR-observed species, probably vanadium(IV),
might be low. Because disappearance of the signal in the 51V NMR spectrum was observed when 1 was added to Me2AlCl, a detailed analysis is required to explore the oxidation
state of the probable catalytically active species.

We thus
focus on the synchrotron XAS because the method (V–K
edge analysis, 5.46 keV, through synchrotron radiation at SPring-8,
BL01B1 beamline) provides information concerning the oxidation state
[by V–K pre-edge and edge peaks in the X-ray absorption near-edge
structure (XANES) analysis] and coordination atoms around the vanadium
[by FT extended X-ray absorption fine structure (FT-EXAFS) analysis]. Figure 3 shows the XANES
spectra of toluene solution containing V(NAd)Cl2(L) [1, L = 2-(2′-benzimidazolyl)-6-methylpyridine] and
the solution in the presence of MAO or Me2AlCl (10.0 equiv).
The spectra of V(NAd)Cl2[2-ArCH2(C5H4)] (4),58 V(NAd)Cl3,67 and the (imido)vanadium(IV)
complex, V(NAd)Cl2[N(H)Me2]2,80 measured under the same conditions are also
shown for comparison (Figure 3a).

Figure 3 Solution-phase V K-edge XANES spectra (in toluene at 25 °C)
for (a) V(NR)Cl2(L) [R = Ad (1), C6H5 (2), L = 2-(2′-benzimidazolyl)-6-methylpyridine].
Spectra for V(NAd)Cl2[2-ArCH2(C5H4)],58 V(NAd)Cl3,58 and V(NAd)Cl2[N(H)Me2]
measured under the same conditions are also placed for comparison.
(b) V(NAd)Cl2(L) [1, L = 2-(2′-benzimidazolyl)-6-methylpyridine]
in the presence of Al cocatalyst [MAO, Me2AlCl, Me2AlCl, and ETA10.0 equiv].

As shown in Figure 3a, V(NAd)Cl2(L) [1, L = 2-(2′-benzimidazolyl)-6-methylpyridine]
shows two pre-edge peaks at 5465.5 and 5467.7 eV in addition to a
small shoulder-edge peak at 5477.0 eV. Similarly, V(NPh)Cl2(L) (2) shows pre-edge peak(s) at 5465.7 and 5467.5
eV in addition to a small shoulder-edge peak at 5478.1 eV. These are
similar to the observed facts that two pre-edge peaks were observed
in V(NAd)Cl2[2-ArCH2(C5H4)] (4, 5465.2 and 5467.3 eV) and V(NAd)Cl3 (5465.6 and 5467.1 eV), and these complexes also showed a shoulder-edge
peak (5477.8 and 5477.6 eV, respectively) that would be ascribed to
the V–Cl bond.58 Two pre-edge peaks
are probably due to a transition from 1s to 3d + 4p,84,85 although examples of solution V K-edge XANES spectra by synchrotron
radiation still have been limited.86,87 By contrast,
the related (imido)vanadium(IV) dichloride, V(NAd)Cl2[N(H)Me2]2, showed a broad pre-edge peak at 5466.4 eV and
a shoulder-edge peak at 5477.5 eV. It is clear from the spectra that
the edge peak of the vanadium(IV) dichloride complex low-shifted compared
to the vanadium(V) dichloride complexes. These results also suggest
that the observed shoulder-edge peak would be ascribed to the V–Cl
bond.58

It was revealed that no significant
differences in the XANES spectrum
(pre-edge peaks and edge) from that in 1 was observed
upon addition of MAO [5465.5 and 5467.7 eV (pre-edge), 5476.8 eV (shoulder-edge), Figure 3b]. These results
thus suggest that the oxidation state of 1 was preserved
upon addition of MAO, and the results would be in good agreement with
those in the NMR and ESR spectra. By contrast, it should be noted
that remarkable changes in the XANES (pre-edge and edge regions) spectrum
were observed when 1 [5465.5 and 5467.7 eV (pre-edge),
5477.0 eV (shoulder-edge)] was treated with Me2AlCl [5466.0
eV (pre-edge), 5475.8 eV (shoulder-edge), Figure 4]. Apparently, the low-energy shift in the
edge peak (in addition to change from two to one pre-edge peak) strongly
suggests that complex 1 was reduced by reaction with
Me2AlCl, and the result is consistent with that observed
especially in the 51V NMR spectrum (disappearance of signal
because of the generation of paramagnetic species). The remarkable
changes in the XANES (pre-edge and edge regions) spectrum suggest
the structural changes upon addition of Me2AlCl, especially
by reduction. Moreover, the intensity in the shoulder-edge (5475.7
eV) increased upon addition of ETA on decreasing the intensity of
the pre-edge peak (5465.5 eV), and this corresponds to the fact that
the activity increased upon addition of ETA. The results thus suggest
that the addition of ETA would be effective for the generation (increased
percentage) of catalytically active species by certain structural
changes with the reduction of 1.

and the simulated spectrum for V(NAd)Cl2(L) (1). In this simulation (on the basis of X-ray crystallographic data),

from the V atom were considered, and 0.0036 Å2 of
the Debye–Waller factor was applied. (b) Solution-phase V K-edge

Additional analysis data are shown in the Supporting Information.

Figure 4a shows
the EXAFS oscillations and the simulated spectrum of 1 in toluene.82 The observed spectrum shows
a good fitting with that estimated from the X-ray crystallographic
data (Figure 4a). Three
nitrogen atoms are coordinated to vanadium [coordination number (CN)
1.7(2), V–N = 1.683 Å; CN 1.2(8), V–N = 2.290(42)
Å], which probably corresponds to three vanadium–nitrogen
bonds [V–N(1): 1.647(2), V–N(2): 2.279(2), and V–N(3):
1.918(2) Å, Table 1]. The spectrum also suggests the presence of two V–Cl bonds
[CN 1.6(2), V–Cl = 2.293(3) Å], which also correspond
well to the two vanadium–chloride bonds [V–Cl(1): 2.2376(7)
and V–Cl(2): 2.2532(7) Å]. The results clearly indicate
that complex 1 preserves the basic trigonal bipyramidal
structure (determined by X-ray crystallography) in solution. It was
revealed that the CN of the vanadium–nitrogen bond decreased
upon addition of Me2AlCl [CN 0.9(3), V–N: 1.64(2)
Å, additional analysis data are shown in the Supporting Information], suggesting that two nitrogen bonds
(maybe in L) would probably be dissociated upon addition of Me2AlCl (Figure 4b). We are unsure about the reason for the presence of two/three
V–Cl bonds [CN 2.6(1), V–Cl = 2.455(7) Å], which
became apparently weak compared to those in the original (complex 1, V–Cl = 2.293(3) Å). Taking into account the
result in Figure 4,
we can at least say that reduction occurred from 1 (probably
by dissociation of two vanadium–nitrogen bonds) upon addition
of Me2AlCl, although the detailed structure in the real catalytically active species is still unclear at this
moment.

Through 51V NMR, ESR, and XAS analyses, it
was revealed
that (i) no resonances in the 51V NMR spectrum were observed
when V(NAd)Cl2(L) [1, L = 2-(2′-benzimidazolyl)-6-methylpyridine]
was treated with 10.0 equiv of Me2AlCl in toluene-d8 at 25 °C, (ii) formation of paramagnetic
species (but weak intensity) was observed in the toluene solution
of 1 upon addition of Me2AlCl (10 equiv) in
the ESR spectrum, whereas no resonances were observed upon addition
of MAO in place of Me2AlCl, and (iii) remarkable changes
in the XANES (pre-edge and edge regions) spectrum was observed when 1 was added with Me2AlCl in toluene, whereas no
significant differences were observed upon addition of MAO. These
results strongly suggest the observed difference as the effect of
the Al cocatalyst (MAO vs Me2AlCl) in the reaction with
ethylene using 1 because of the formation of different
catalytically active species with different oxidation states. Because
the observed XANES spectra upon addition of Me2AlCl are
different (especially, the edge region) from those in (adamantylimido)vanadium(IV)
dichloride, V(NAd)Cl2[N(H)Me2]2,
and the intensity of resonances observed in the ESR spectrum (Figure 3c) was weak, it thus
seems likely and may be assumed that certain vanadium(III) species
by reduction was generated from 1 upon addition of Me2AlCl, although we could not come to any detailed conclusion
(structure, oxidation state) at this stage from the EXAFS spectrum.

3 Concluding Remarks
Three (imido)vanadium(V)
dichloride complexes containing 2-(2′-benzimidazolyl)-6-methylpyridine
ligand (L) of type, V(NR)Cl2(L) [R = 1-adamantyl (Ad, 1), C6H5 (2), 2,6-Me2C6H3 (3)], were prepared,
and their structures could be determined by X-ray crystallographic
analysis. These complexes fold distorted trigonal bipyramidal structures
around vanadium and a plane consisting of three nitrogen atoms in
the 2-(2′-benzimidazolyl)pyridine ligand and the imido ligand
positioned perpendicular to a plane consisting of two chloride and
vanadium. These complexes (1–3) exhibited catalytic
activities for the reaction with ethylene in the presence of MAO,
affording a mixture of oligomer and polymers, and the compositions
were affected by the imido ligand employed. By contrast, the complexes
(1–3) exhibited remarkable catalytic activities
for ethylene polymerization in the presence of Me2AlCl.
The phenylimido complex (2) exhibited an exceptionally
high activity [80 100 kg-PE/mol-V·h (TOF 2 850 000
h–1, 792 s–1)], which was higher
than those reported previously by the aryloxo-modified (imido)vanadium
dichloride complexes, demonstrating its promising capability as the
efficient ethylene polymerization catalyst. Complex 2 was also effective for ethylene copolymerization with NBE to afford
ultrahigh-molecular-weight copolymers with uniform molecular weight
distributions and compositions, suggesting that the polymerization
proceeds with uniform catalytically active species.

On the basis
of the studies by NMR and ESR spectra and solution
V K-edge XAS (XANES and EXAFS) analysis, the observed difference in
the catalyst performances in the presence of (between) MAO and Me2AlCl cocatalyst should be due to the formation of different
catalytically active species with different oxidation states. In particular,
significant changes in the oxidation state were observed upon addition
of Me2AlCl in the XANES spectrum (in addition to NMR and
ESR spectra), and the intensity in the shoulder-edge increased upon
addition of ETA with decreasing intensity of the preedge peak, whereas
no significant changes in the spectra were observed upon the presence
of MAO. Although the detailed structural analysis of the catalyst
solution consisting of 1 and Me2AlCl could
not be done at this moment, the observed fact should provide important
information for a better understanding of the catalysis mechanism
and catalyst design. Moreover, we believe that a combination of all
these analyses (NMR and ESR spectra and XAS analysis) should be helpful
in providing more clear information for better understanding and explanation.
We are now exploring more details, including further analyses of the
catalyst solutions (and complexes) through solution XAS (XANES, EXAFS)
analysis, including assignments of resonances; these would be introduced
in the future.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 General Procedure
All experiments
were conducted in a Vacuum Atmospheres drybox under a nitrogen atmosphere.
Toluene, n-hexane, and dichloromethane of anhydrous
grade (Kanto Kagaku Co., Ltd.) were stored in a bottle containing
molecular sieves (a mixture of 3A 1/16, 4A 1/8, and 13X 1/16) in the
drybox; solvents were further purified by passing through an alumina
short column under a nitrogen stream prior to use. V(NAd)Cl3 (Ad = 1-adamantyl),67 V(NC6H5)Cl3,54 V(N-2,6-Me2C6H3)Cl3,68 and V(NAd)Cl2[N(H)Me2]280 were prepared according to a published
method. Me2AlCl (1.0 M in n-hexane, Kanto
Kagaku Co., Ltd.) and ethylene for polymerization (purity >99.9%,
Sumitomo Seika Co. Ltd.) were used as received. Toluene and AlMe3 in methylaluminoxane [TMAO, 9.5 wt % (Al) toluene solution,
Tosoh Finechem] were removed in vaccuo (at ca. 50 °C for removal
of toluene and AlMe3, and then heated at >100 °C
for
1 h for completion) in the drybox to afford white solids.57

Elemental analyses were performed by using
a EAI CE-440 CHN/O/S elemental analyzer (Exeter Analytical, Inc.).
All 1H, 13C, and 51V NMR spectra
were recorded on a Bruker AV500 spectrometer (500.13 MHz for 1H, 125.77 MHz for 13C, and 131.55 MHz for 51V). All spectra were obtained in the solvent indicated at
25 °C, unless otherwise noted. Chemical shifts are given in ppm
and are referenced to SiMe4 (δ 0.00 ppm, 1H, 13C) and VOCl3 (δ 0.00 ppm, 51V). Coupling constants and half-width values, Δν1/2, are given in Hz. 13C NMR spectra for the resultant
polymers were recorded with proton decoupling, the pulse interval
was 5.2 s, the acquisition time was 0.8 s, the pulse angle was 90°,
and the number of transients accumulated was about 6000. The copolymer
samples for analysis were prepared by dissolving the polymers in 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane-d2 solution, and the spectra was measured at
110 °C. GC analysis was performed with a SHIMADZU GC-2025AF gas
chromatograph (Shimadzu Co. Ltd.) equipped with a flame ionization
detector.

Molecular weights and molecular weight distributions
of the prepared
polymers were measured by GPC (Tosoh HLC-8121GPC/HT) using an RI-8022
detector (for high temperature; Tosoh Co.) with a polystyrene gel
column (TSK gel GMHHR-H HT32, 30 cm, 37.8 mm i.d.), ranging from <102 to <2.8 × 108 MW) at 140 °C using o-dichlorobenzene containing 0.05 w/v % 2,6-di-tert-butyl-p-cresol as the solvent. DSC data for the
polymer were recorded by means of a Hitachi DSC-7020 instrument under
a nitrogen atmosphere [preheating from 30 to 300 °C (20 °C/min),
cooling to −100 °C under N2, and measurement
from −100 to 300 °C (20 °C/min) under N2]. This heating and cooling was repeated two times. Tg values were determined from the middle point of the
phase transition of the second heating scan.

4.1.1 Synthesis
of V(NAd)Cl2(L) [1, L = 2-(2′-Benzimidazolyl)-6-methylpyridine]
(i) Synthesis of LK. Into the THF solution (15 mL) containing 2-(2′-6′-methylpyridiyl)-benzimidazole
(836 mg, 4.0 mmol),69 KH powder (160 mg,
4.0 mmol) was added at −30 °C in the drybox. The reaction
mixture was warmed slowly to room temperature and stirred for 4 h.
The resultant white solid (insoluble in THF) was then collected and
dried in vacuo (935 mg, 94%). (ii) Synthesis of complex 1. To a toluene solution (20 mL) containing V(NAd)Cl3 (568
mg, 1.82 mmol), LK (450 mg, 1.82 mmol) was added at −30 °C.
The reaction mixture was warmed slowly to room temperature and stirred
overnight (ca. 16 h). The resultant red brown solution was filtered
and extracted with toluene. The extracts were filtered through a Celite
pad, and the filtercake was washed with toluene. The toluene extract
(combined filtrate and the wash) was then placed in vacuo to remove
volatiles, giving deep red solids. The resultant solids were then
dissolved in a minimum amount of dichloromethane layered by n-hexane. The chilled solution placed in the freezer (−30
°C) yielded deep red microcrystals, which were dried in vacuo.

4.1.2 Synthesis
of V(NC6H5)Cl2(L) (2)
The procedure for the
synthesis of 2 was similar to that for 1, except that V(NC6H5)Cl3 (485 mg,
1.95 mmol) in place of V(NAd)Cl3 and LK (483 mg, 1.95 mmol)
were used. After the reactions and extraction with toluene, the resultant
solids after the removal of volatiles were dissolved with a minimum
amount of dichloromethane layered by n-hexane. The
chilled solution placed in the freezer (−30 °C) yielded
deep red microcrystals, which were dried in vacuo. Yield 621 mg (75%). 1H NMR (CDCl3): δ 8.10 (d, J = 8.05 Hz, 1H), 7.93 (d, J = 7.70 Hz, 1H), 7.75

4.1.3 Synthesis
of V(N-2,6-Me2C6H3)Cl2(L) (3)
The procedure for synthesis of 3 was similar to that
for 1, except that V(N-2,6-Me2C6H3)Cl3 (206 mg, 0.744 mmol) in place of V(NAd)Cl3 and LK (184 mg, 0.744 mmol) were used. After the reactions
and extraction with toluene, the resultant solids after the removal
of volatiles were dissolved with a minimum amount of dichloromethane
layered by n-hexane. The chilled solution placed
in the freezer (−30 °C) yielded deep red microcrystals,
which were dried in vacuo. Yield 184 mg (55%). 1H NMR (CDCl3): δ 8.18 (br s, 1H), 7.88 (br s, 1H), 7.74 (d, 1H, J = 7.8 Hz), 7.64 (br s, 1H), 7.42 (br s, 1H), 7.07 (br

4.2 Reaction with Ethylene
Reactions
with ethylene were conducted in a 100 mL scale stainless steel autoclave,
and the typical reaction procedure is as follows. Toluene (29.0 mL)
and the prescribed amount of MAO or Me2AlCl (1.0 M n-hexane) were added into the autoclave in the drybox. The
reaction apparatus was then filled with ethylene (1 atm), and the
prescribed amount of complex, V(NR)Cl2(L) [L = 2-(2′-benzimidazolyl)-6-methylpyridine],
in toluene (1.0 mL) was added into the autoclave. The reaction apparatus
was then immediately pressurized to 7 atm (total 8 atm, kept constant
during the reaction), and the mixture was magnetically stirred for
10 or 15 min. After the reaction, the remaining ethylene was purged
at −30 °C, and 0.5 g of n-heptane (internal
standard) was added. Both the activity and product distribution were
then analyzed by GC. After the above oligomerization procedure, the
mixture remaining in the reactor was poured into MeOH containing HCl;
the resultant white precipitate was collected on a filter paper by
filtration, and the powder was adequately washed with MeOH. The resultant
polymer was then dried in vacuo at 60 °C for 2 h. The MeOH soluble
portion was extracted with CHCl3, washed with water, and
dried through Na2SO4. Removal of volatiles afforded
a high-molecular-weight oligomer (or a low-molecular-weight PE).

4.3 Copolymerization of Ethylene with Cyclic Olefins
by V(NC6H5)Cl2(L) (2)–Me2AlCl Catalyst System
The polymerization
procedures conducted were similar to those conducted in ethylene polymerization/oligomerization.
Toluene (29.0 or 9.0 mL) and the prescribed amount of cyclic olefin
(NBE etc.) and Me2AlCl (1.0 M n-hexane)
were added into the autoclave in the drybox. The reaction apparatus
was then filled with ethylene (1 atm), and the prescribed amount of
the complex, V(NC6H5)Cl2(L) (2), in toluene (1.0 mL) was added into the autoclave. The
reaction apparatus was then immediately pressurized to 1 or 7 atm
(total 2 or 8 atm), and the mixture was stirred for 6 or 10 min. After
the reaction, the mixture in the reactor was poured into MeOH containing
HCl, and the resultant polymer was collected on a filter paper by
filtration, which was adequately washed with MeOH. The resultant polymer
was then dried in vacuo at 60 °C for 2 h. Selected 13C NMR spectra (Figure S3) and DSC thermograms
(Figure S4) in the resultant polymers are
shown in the Supporting Information.

4.4 Crystallographic Analysis
All measurements
were made on a Rigaku XtaLAB P200 diffractometer using multilayer
mirror monochromated Mo Kα radiation. The crystal collection
parameters are listed in Table 5. The data were collected and processed using CrystalClear
(Rigaku)88 or CrysAlisPro (Rigaku Oxford
Diffraction),89 and the structure was solved
by direct methods90 and expanded using
Fourier techniques. The nonhydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically.
Hydrogen atoms were refined using the riding model. All calculations
were performed using the CrystalStructure91 crystallographic software package, except for refinement, which
was performed using SHELXL version 2014/7.92,93 Structure reports and xyz files for V(NR)Cl2(L) [R =

4.5 51V NMR Experiments in the Reaction
of V(NAd)Cl2(L) [1, L = 2-(2′-Benzimidazolyl)-6-methylpyridine]
with Al Cocatalysts in Toluene-d8
The typical procedure is as follows. Into a toluene-d8 solution (ca. 0.6 mL) containing 1 (25
μmol, ca. 42 μmol/mL) placed in the freezer (−30
°C), Al cocatalyst (Me2AlCl or MAO; 250 μmol,
10.0 equiv) was added. The mixture was then measured by 51V NMR spectrum at 25 °C within 10 min after the preparation.

4.6 ESR Measurements
ESR measurement
was performed with a Bruker ER073 spectrometer. A toluene solution
containing V(NAd)Cl2(L) (1) and a toluene
solution containing MAO (10.0 equiv) or Me2AlCl (10.0 equiv)
were mixed with their concentrations being kept at 2.50 μmol/mL
for 1 and 25.0 μmol/mL for MAO or Me2AlCl. The tube was then placed into the instrument preset (ESR measurements
were started in less than 10 min after the preparation). The experimental
parameters were as follows: 9.4 GHz frequency, 0.10 mT modulation
amplitude, and power 1.0 mW for 1 + Me2AlCl
and 1 + MAO [9.85 GHz frequency for 1 and
V(NAd)Cl2{N(H)Me2}2].

4.7 Analysis of the Catalyst Solution by Solution-Phase
XAS
V K-edge XANES and XAFS measurements were carried out
at the BL01B1 beam line at the SPring-8 facility of the Japan Synchrotron
Radiation Research Institute (proposal nos. 2016A1455 and 2016B1509).
The measurements were conducted at room temperature. A Si(111) two-crystal
monochromator was used for the incident beam. V K-edge XAFS spectra
of V complex samples (prepared as toluene solution, 50 μmol/mL)
were recorded in the fluorescence mode using an ionization chamber
as the I0 detector and 19 solid-state
detectors as the I detector. The X-ray energy was
calibrated using V2O5, and the data analysis
was performed with REX2000 ver. 2.5.9 software package (Rigaku Co.).
The XANES data were analyzed by removing the atomic absorption background
using a cubic spline from the χ spectra and normalization of
them to the edge height.

2008 , 37 , 572 –584 . 10.1002/xrs.1103 .The transition of a 1s electron to 3d orbital
gives weak pre-edge peaks due to the electric quadrupole transition
for any symmetries. An intense pre-edge peak is assigned to an electric
dipole transition to p-character in the d-p hybridized orbital, and
the mixing of a metal 4p orbital with the 3d orbital strongly depends
on the coordination symmetry.
