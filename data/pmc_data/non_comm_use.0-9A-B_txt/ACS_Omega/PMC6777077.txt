A double-network
strategy to toughen epoxy resin system is presented
herein. Dihydrocoumarin (DHC), a hexatomic compound extracted from
tonka bean, is used as the building block for the construction of
the first network, and the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A epoxy matrix
is used as the second network. The resultant double network demonstrates
a single glass transition and good compatibility between these two
networks. Owing to the firm interfacial adhesion between networks
and the effective stress transfer as well as external energy absorption
derived from the DHC-based network, the double-network-based epoxy
resin shows a significant toughness improvement without trade-offs
in the tensile strength and elongation at break. The finding in this
study provides a promising way to overcome the intrinsic brittleness
of commercial epoxy resin via the utilization of renewable DHC for
the construction of a novel double network.

==== Body
Introduction
Epoxy resins are widely
used in electrical insulators, composites,
coatings, and adhesives due to their superior mechanical strength
and chemical resistance.1−3 However, the inherent brittleness
and poor impact resistance due to its highly cross-linked network
structure limits the application of epoxy resin as a load-bearing
material, especially in some harsh environments like automotive and
aerospace fields.4

Overcoming the
intrinsic brittleness is significant for epoxy resins,
and extensive efforts have been devoted to improving the resin toughness
over the last decades.5−8 These works are generally performed via the incorporation of thermoplastic
or inorganic fillers like rubber-based core–shell particles,
silica, and nanoparticles into the resin matrix.9−14 These fillers act as the dispersed phase to absorb energy and terminate
the crack propagation by bonding with the resin matrix, thereby toughening
and reinforcing the epoxy.5−17

In recent years, green approaches derived from natural resources
have emerged to toughen the epoxy resin, as they are available, environmentally
friendly, non-noxious, and renewable.18−20 Among these approaches,
using plant oil or their derivates as a modifier is an important strategy
to toughen the epoxy resin system.21−23 Utilizing blending and
copolymerization of these plant oil derivates in the epoxy mixture,
effective improvement in impact strength can be achieved. However,
it is noteworthy that an obvious decrease in tensile strength occurs
with the introduction of these plant oil derivates into the epoxy
system.24 This is due to the lack of interfacial
interaction between the epoxy matrix and the plant oil additives.
Fei et al. chemically modified the surface of tannic acid (TA) through
the ring-opening reaction between TA and 1,2-epoxydodecane in the
presence of triphenylphosphine catalyst.25 This modified TA has good dispersion in the diglycidyl ether of
bisphenol A (DGEBA) matrix and can be used as an effective toughening
agent without the trade-off of tensile strength. Using branched polymers
to toughen the epoxy resin is another effective strategy due to their
spherical arrangement and the adhesion with the matrix via the surface
functional groups. Wang et al. had synthesized a branched triscardanyl
phosphate (PTCP), comprising phosphaphenanthrene groups, from biobased
cardanol. Compared to the neat DGEBA, the addition of 20 wt % PTCP
leads to an improvement in impact strength, tensile strength, and
elongation at break simultaneously.26 This
toughening effect is attributed not only to the rigid benzyl groups
but also the hydroxyl groups attached on the branched chains. These
hydroxyl groups could react with the DGEBA epoxy groups to enhance
the interfacial adhesion. Clearly, the toughening effect is highly
correlated to the interfacial adhesion of the epoxy matrix and the
toughening agent. Firm interfacial adhesion plays an important role
in effectively transferring external stress from the epoxy matrix
to the toughening agent phase. In this way, the brittle epoxy resin
would have a better performance in the impact resistance compared
to those with poor interfacial adhesion.

In addition to the
approaches mentioned above, double-network strategy
is another emerging approach showing promising perspective in the
toughening of polymeric materials.27 Compared
to the modification of the surface of the toughening agents to improve
the interfacial adhesion, the double network can achieve this effect
via the forced compatibility between the epoxy phase and the toughening
agent phase.28 Reasonable network design
within the polymeric matrix is the key factor for the successful construction
of the double network. Dihydrocoumarin (DHC, chemical structure is
shown in Scheme 1)
is an appealing monomer that is derived from coumarin, a renewable
feedstock from tonka bean with a hexatomic ring structure. Due to
the modest ring strain, DHC can achieve alternative copolymerization
with an epoxy group via the ring-opening reaction to obtain polyesters
with high molecular weight.29,30 In this research, we
intend to fabricate a DHC-based network (i.e., DHC-N) via solvent-free
chromium(III) salen-mediated pathway and use it as the first network.
Diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA), the most widely used commercial
epoxy resin, is used as the second network. A double network can be
constructed via introducing the DHC-based network (DHC-N) into the
relatively rigid DGEBA matrix. In addition to the forced compatible
effect via the double-network strategy, similar phenyl moiety existing
both in DGEBA and DHC is also beneficial to their compatibility. It
is expected that this novel DHC-based network plays a vital role in
stress transfer and external energy absorption, whereby DGEBA epoxy
system can achieve remarkable performance improvement in terms of
impact strength, tensile strength, and elongation at break simultaneously.

Results and Discussion
DHC-N Network
The modest ring strain in DHC monomer
provides the possibility of achieving an alternative copolymerization
with epoxides via the metal-mediated catalysis approach.30 Here, chromium(III) complex was used as the
Lewis acid to activate the ring-opening of epoxide and [PPN]+ serves
as counterion to form a chromium(III) alkoxide. To construct a cross-linked
network rather than a linear structure, the poly(ethylene glycol)
diglycidyl ether (PEGDE) with two terminal epoxy groups was applied
here as one of the building blocks. Scheme 1 displays the synthesis of the DHC-N network
using the alternating copolymerization of DHC, PEGDE, and BGE.

The chain propagation and molecular weight growth in the initial
synthesis stage of the DHC-N network were measured by GPC (Figure 1 and Table 1). Table 1 displays the increase of the average molecular
weight (e.g., Mn, Mw, Mp, Mz) with the reaction time at 80 °C. Clearly, the growth of the
molecular weight is attributed to the alternative ring-opening reaction
of the epoxy ring and the DHC ring with the aid of a catalyst. Compared
to the Mp at reaction time of 1 h, the
counterpart undergoing a 2 or 3 h reaction has a much higher value,
implying a significant molecular weight increase within 2 h. Besides,
the higher polydispersity after 2 or 3 h reaction indicates that in
addition to the higher molecular weight fraction, the relatively lower
ones still exist. The chemical structure features of DHC and DHC-N
were represented via NMR spectra (Figure 2). The signals in the range of 7.25–6.70
ppm are attributed to the aromatic moieties of the DHC. The signal
at 3.63 ppm corresponds to the methoxy group (−CH2–O−) derived from the PEGDE segment. The signals in
the range of 2.52–3.00 ppm are associated with the protons
of methylene in the DHC segment. The signals at 0.75, 1.14, and 1.29
ppm belong to the methyl and methylene moieties of the BGE segment,
respectively.

DGEBA-Based Double Network
(D-N)
The double network
(D-N) can be constructed via the immersion of the DHC-N into the DGEBA
monomers and the subsequent polymerization with the aid of DICY (Figure S1). The curing behaviors of D-N and the
neat DGEBA are described via the differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) exothermic curves (Figure 3). Compared to the neat DGEBA, the exothermic peak
temperature of D-N does not change too much (Figure 3a). On the other hand, an obvious decrease
in the starting conversion temperature can be observed in the conversion
against temperature curve (Figure 3b). With increase in DHC-N loading, the starting conversion
temperature shifts to a lower value. This that means the DHC-N existing
in the double network has a positive effect on lowering the curing
temperature of DGEBA.

Figure 3 (a) DSC thermograms of neat DGEBA, D-N 10%, and D-N 40%.
(b) Conversion
degree against temperature during the curing process of neat DGEBA,
D-N 10%, and D-N 40%.

Figure 4 shows the
Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of neat DGEBA, DHC, DHC-N,
and cured D-N. It can be seen from the figure that these four curves
are similar with the following absorption peaks: the peaks at 3000–2800
cm–1 are the characteristic signals of C–H
stretching vibration and the peaks at 1530–1470 cm–1 are the characteristic signals of aromatic moiety. Compared to the
neat DGEBA, the strong absorption peaks at 1750–1720 and 1200–1100
cm–1 are attributed to the carbonyl (C=O)
group and ether (C–O–C) group, respectively, that exist
in DHC, DHC-N, and cured D-N networks. Moreover, it is noteworthy
that, as the D-N FTIR curve shows, the characteristic epoxy peak (850–800
cm–1) of neat DGEBA disappeared after undergoing
a curing process with the DHC-N network. This indicates that the epoxy
rings in DGEBA monomers were consumed via the ring opening of epoxy
groups in the D-N construction process.

DGEBA, DHC, DHC-N, and cured D-N.

Thermal and Mechanical Properties
The dynamic mechanical
properties of neat DGEBA and the DHC-N incorporated epoxy resins have
been investigated by the dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). As Figure 5a shows, the DHC-N
loading influences the storage modulus significantly. Compared to
the neat DGEBA, the temperature (Td) at
which the storage modulus started to decline shifted to a lower value
of 125 °C after 10 wt % DHC-N was introduced into the DGEBA matrix.
This can be attributed to the flexible polyether structures contained
in the DHC-N network. The polyether structures derived from the PEGDE
and BGE monomers have a lower internal barrier, which leads to an
easy chain rotation and significant lowering of the temperature at
which the storage modulus starts to decline. As Figure 5c shows, the onset temperature Td keeps decreasing with increase of DHC-N loading; however,
it is noteworthy that this decreasing tendency begins to slow down
when the DHC-N loading is higher than 20 wt %. This probably indicates
that a fully developed DHC-N network was built within the epoxy resin
when its content was higher than 20 wt %, so that the storage modulus
is relatively stable and less susceptible to variation of the DHC-N
content.

DHC-N loadings. (c) Onset temperature, Td (i.e., a temperature at which storage modulus starts to decline
significantly), of the D-N modified epoxy resin as a function of the
DHC-N loading. (d) Tg composition behavior
of the blends: (○) Tg measured
from DMA and (●) Tg calculated
based on Fox equation, and the k values shown in
the inset are calculated based on the Gorden-Taylor equation.

The compatibilities of the DGEBA matrix network
and the DHC-N network
are investigated via the dynamic mechanical analysis. The single loss
peak during the entire temperature range indicates a good compatibility
between the DGEBA matrix and the DHC-N portion (Figure 5b). For binary compatible blends, the glass
transition can be predicted via the Fox equation or Gorden-Taylor
equation.31 The Fox equation can be expressed
as follows 1  The Gorden-Taylor equation can be expressed
as follows 2  where Tg is the
glass transition of the blend and wi is the weight fraction of component i. The
interaction of these two components can be reflected by the k value. A k value higher than 1 suggests
a stronger interaction of the two components in comparison with the
self-interaction of the single component; in contrast, a k value lower than 1 suggests a relatively weaker interaction compared
to the self-interaction. For the binary system studied here, the k values are higher than 1 in the entire DHC-N loading range
(Figure 5d), indicating
that the interaction between the DGEBA matrix and the DHC-N network
is stronger compared to the self-interaction of the single network
itself. This result is attributed to the specific double network and
the correlated chemical structures. It is noteworthy that both DGEBA
and DHC have the phenyl moiety. The similar phenyl moiety is beneficial
to the interaction and compatibility of the DGEBA epoxy/DHC-N bionetwork.
Moreover, the double-network structure plays an important role in
the forced compatibility and the enhanced interaction in this binary
system.

Toughening effect of the double network on the epoxy
resin is investigated
by the impact and tensile tests. The results are displayed in Figure 6. Remarkable improvement
in impact strength was achieved after the incorporation of the DHC-N
bionetwork. Thermoset with a 20 wt % DHC-N loading shows the best
toughening effect and the highest impact strength of 31.5 kJ/m2, which is almost twice the value of the neat epoxy (15 kJ/m2). More importantly, the increase in impact strength is achieved
without impairing the tensile strength, which is verified by the tensile
test. As Figure 6b
shows, a continuous increase in tensile strength can be observed with
the increase of the DHC-N loading, and the highest impact strength
and tensile strength are obtained simultaneously when the DHC-N loading
reaches up to 20 wt %. As discussed in the DMA storage modulus analysis,
the decreasing tendency of Td slows down
when the DHC-N loading reaches 20 wt %. This value is consistent with
that observed in the mechanical strength test, in which the highest
impact strength and tensile strength are achieved at a DHC-N loading
of 20 wt %. Therefore, it is speculated that 20 wt % is the threshold
for the construction of the double network. Below this threshold,
the DHC-N network is not fully developed within the epoxy resin and
the mechanical properties (e.g., impact strength, tensile strength)
continue to increase with increase of the DHC-N loading; above this
threshold, excess DHC-N components lead to a more flexible network
and reduce the overall mechanical strength. For the double network
studied here, experimental data show that 20 wt % DHC-N is the optimal
loading to achieve the best mechanical performance (e.g., the highest
impact strength and tensile strength). At this loading level, the
external stress and impact experienced by the DGEBA epoxy would be
effectively transferred and absorbed via the relatively flexible DHC-N
bionetwork to retard the rupture of the entire network.

Figure 6 Impact (a)
and tensile (b) properties of DGEBA and D-N-modified
epoxy resins.

The toughening effect and fracture
behavior of the epoxy resins
were further revealed by the SEM micrographs (Figure 7). Sharp and smooth morphology can be clearly
recognized for the neat DGEBA (Figure 7a), indicating a typical brittle fracture and a relatively
low impact strength. When 20 wt % loading of DHC-N was added into
the epoxy, a rougher fracture surface with more fibrils was formed
(Figure 7b), indicating
the specimen was broken in a more yielding way. The fibrils observed
on the fracture surface are attributed to the fast crack growth, shear
yielding, and coalescence of these microcracks,32,33 whereby excessive energy could be absorbed to improve the toughness
of the epoxy resin. As Figure 7b shows, no phase separation was observed on the fracture
surface when 20 wt % DHC-N was incorporated into the epoxy resin.
This image reveals a good compatibility of the DHC-N portion and the
DGEBA matrix, which is consistent with the signal loss peak observed
in the DMA measurement.

neat DGEBA epoxy
and (b) D-N-modified epoxy resin with 20 wt % DHC-N loading.

Figure 8 shows the
thermogravimetric behaviors of the neat DGEBA epoxy and the D-N-modified
resins with different DHC-N loadings. Compared to the neat epoxy DGEBA,
the DHC-N displays a significantly lower thermal degradation temperature
at around 250 °C. However, once DHC-N is incorporated into the
DGEBA to form a double network, the typical thermal degradation temperature
of around 250 °C disappeared and a higher degradation temperature
of around 400 °C was observed. This fact can be attributed to
the good compatibility of the DHC-N bionetwork and the DGEBA epoxy
resin via the forced compatible effect derived from the double network,
which, in turn, produces a greater adhesion between the DHC-N network
and the epoxy DGEBA matrix to prevent the elimination of the volatile
fragments. Furthermore, the incorporation of the DHC-N network into
the DGEBA matrix also slightly enhances the thermal stability of the
entire system as shown by the increased degradation temperatures in
the inset.

Conclusions
This
paper reports a new method of toughening epoxy resin via fabricating
a DHC-based network through a solvent-free chromium(III) salen-mediated
pathway. This DHC-based network (DHC-N) is derived from renewable
coumarin, and the single loss peak observed in the DMA measurement
proved that this newly developed network is well-compatible with the
epoxy resin system. A double-network structure can be constructed
via the introduction of the DHC-based network into the DGEBA matrix.
Prominent improvement in the mechanical performance was achieved through
the double-network strategy; with 20 wt % DHC-N loading, the thermoset
epoxy showed the highest impact strength of 31.5 kJ/m2,
which is almost twice the value of the neat epoxy (15.0 kJ/m2). Besides, the tensile strength and elongation at break were also
increased by 14 and 45% respectively, reaching values of 71 MPa and
8%, respectively. The interaction between the DGEBA matrix network
and the DHC-based network was described via the Gorden-Taylor equation
and the k values higher than 1 indicated that stronger
interactions existed between these two networks in comparison with
the self-interactions existing in the single network itself. SEM was
further conducted to investigate the feature of the fracture surface
of the specimen. Compared to the neat DGEBA epoxy resin, the double-network-based
epoxy resin demonstrated a rougher fracture surface with more fibrils,
indicating that the DHC-N network plays a vital role in stress transfer
and external energy absorption, whereby a significant improvement
in epoxy toughness was obtained without a trade-off of its tensile
strength and elongation at break.

Experimental Section
Materials
Diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA, EEW:
227 g/equiv), dihydrocoumarin (DHC, ≥98%), butyl glycidyl ether
(BGE, 99%), poly(ethyleneglycol) diglycidyl ether (PEGDE, average Mn 500), (S,S)-N,N′-bis(3,5-di-tert-butylsalicylidene)-1,2-cyclohexanediaminochromium(III)
chloride, bis(triphenylphosphoranylidene)ammonium chloride, and dicyandiamide
(DICY) were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

DHC-Based Network (DHC-N)
Preparation
The first network
DHC-N was synthesized via the reaction of dihydrocoumarin (DHC), butyl
glycidyl ether (BGE), and poly(ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ether (PEGDE)
with the aid of catalysts (S,S)-N,N′-bis(3,5-di-tert-butylsalicylidene)-1,2-cyclohexanediamino-chromium(III) chloride
and bis(triphenylphosphoranylidene) ammonium chloride in a molar ratio
of 1.1:0.6:0.2:0.04:0.04. The mixture comprising the reagents mentioned
above was charged into a flask and stirred at 80 °C for 3 h and
120 °C for 0.5 h to obtain a sticky matter named as DHC-N.

Double Network (D-N) Preparation
DHC-N was then impregnated
in the DGEBA matrix containing 5 wt % curing agent dicyandiamide (DICY)
and 3 wt % accelerator in weight ratios (DHC-N/DGEBA) of 1:9, 2:8,
3:7, and 4:6, respectively. Resultant products were designated as
D-N 10%, D-N 20%, D-N 30%, and D-N 40%, respectively. As a comparison,
the single-network structure formed by the curing of the neat DGEBA
was used as the second network.

Preparation of the Curing
Mixtures
The D-N mixture
was stirred at 80 °C for 30 min and then transferred to a poly(tetrafluoroethylene)
mold for further curing. A fully cured resin was obtained after undergoing
a curing process at 100 °C for 2 h and 150 °C for 5 h.

Characterizations
Gel permeation chromatography (GPC)
was used to measure the molecular weight and molar mass distribution
of the DHC-N at different reaction times. N,N-Dimethyl formamide (DMF) was used as the eluent at a flow
rate of 1 mL/min.

Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was performed
on DMA Q800 (New Castle, DE) with a tension mode. Samples with the
dimensions of 40.0 × 8.0 × 0.4 mm3 were tested
from 0 to 260 °C at a heating rate of 3 °C/min and a frequency
of 1 Hz.

Differential scanning analysis (DSC) measurements were
carried
out on DSC Q2000 (TA Instruments). The samples were heated at a rate
of 10 °C/min from 0 to 200 °C under a nitrogen gas atmosphere.
The degree of curing reaction can be represented by the conversion
rate of curing temperature (eq S2), and
the data can be given directly by a DSC instrument. Thermogravimetric
analyses were performed with a TGA-1 (METTLER, Switzerland) analyzer
to investigate the thermal degradation of the cured D-N blends from
45 to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min in a nitrogen
atmosphere.

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was
performed on
a Nicolet iS10 spectrometer (Thermo Corporation). 1H NMR
spectra of DHC and DHC-N were recorded using a Bruker 600 MHz spectrometer
at room temperature. Deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) was
used as the solvent.

The tests of tensile strength and elongation
at break were conducted
using a WDW-50E machine in accordance with ASTM-D-3039. Specimens
of dimensions 50.0 × 10.0 × 0.1–0.5 mm3 with a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min and a gauge length of 25 mm were
used to carry out the test. Impact strength was determined using the
charpy impact tester (model XJJ-50) in accordance with ASTM D-256
for specimens with dimensions of 50.0 × 10.0 × 5.0 mm3.
