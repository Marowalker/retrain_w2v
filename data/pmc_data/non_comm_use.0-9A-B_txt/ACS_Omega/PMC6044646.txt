Development of biosensors
with high sensitivity, high spatial resolution,
and low cost has received significant attention for their applications
in medical diagnosis, diabetes management, and environment-monitoring.
However, achieving a direct electrical contact between redox enzymes
and electrode surfaces and enhancing the operational stability still
remain as challenges. Inorganic metal nanocrystals (NCs) with precisely
controlled shape and surface structure engineered with an appropriate
organic coating can help overcome the challenges associated with their
stability and aggregation for practical biosensor applications. Herein,
we describe a facile, room-temperature, seed-mediated solution-phase
route to synthesize monodisperse Pd@Pt core–shell nanocubes
with subnanometer-thick platinum (Pt) shells. The enzyme electrode
consisting of Pd@Pt core–shell NCs was first covered with a
chitosan (CS) polymer and then glucose oxidase (GOx) immobilized by
a covalent linkage to the CS. This polymer permits covalent immobilization
through active amino (−NH) side groups to improve the stability
and preserve the biocatalytic functions while the Pd@Pt NCs facilitate
enhanced direct electron transfer (DET) in the biosensor. The resultant
biosensor promotes DET and exhibits excellent performance for the
detection of glucose, with a sensitivity of 6.82 μA cm–2 mM–1 and a wide linear range of 1–6 mM.
Our results demonstrate that sensitive electrochemical glucose detection
based on Pd@Pt core–shell NCs provides remarkable opportunities
for designing low-cost and sensitive biosensors.

1 Introduction
Metal
nanocrystals (NCs) with distinct shapes and controllable
facets have received substantial attention because of their attractive
properties such as enhanced electrocatalytic activity and biosensing
properties.1,2 Recently, development of platinum (Pt)-based
bimetallic nanostructures with tailored geometries (e.g., core–shell
nanostructures with ultrathin Pt shell thickness) has received attention
toward enabling enhanced electrocatalytic activity and reducing cost.1,3 In particular, Pd@Pt nanostructures have been extensively reported
for various applications such as fuel cell electrodes,3 hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and glucose
biosensing,4−6 and gas sensors.7 Also,
Pd has been widely used as a substrate to deposit Pt layers because
of its very similar lattice constant and chemical stability.8 Ultrathin Pt layers on single-crystal substrates
have been prepared by vacuum deposition.9 The seed-mediated solution-phase technique has been widely used
recently for the deposition of Pt-on-Pd NCs for the Pd@Pt core–shell
nanostructures, wherein thickness of the Pt shell can be controlled
at 1–6 atomic layers.10,11 However, precise control
of the thickness of the Pt layers down to the subnanometer level is
difficult because of the galvanic replacement reaction between the
two metals in aqueous solutions, which leads to the formation of voids
(small holes) or concave structures at room temperature.3 In addition, the high intrinsic surface energy
and interatomic bond energy (307 kJ/mol) of Pt lead to selective deposition
at the corner sites typically adopts an island growth mode (Volmer–Weber
mode)12 and followed by the diffusion onto
the other faces of the NCs. Thus,
uniform deposition of Pt can be achieved only at a higher reaction
temperature by altering the diffusion rates.10 More recently, Yang et al.13 have reported
the galvanic replacement-free deposition of an ultrathin shell of
0.6 nm thick Au on Ag nanocubes. The galvanic reaction was avoided
by merely increasing the pH to induce the reduction power of ascorbic
acid (AA), thereby blocking the galvanic reaction between Ag and Au3+, and to achieve conformal deposition of three to six atomic
layers of Au shell on Ag nanocubes. However, such a method has not
been investigated for other types of nanoparticles (NPs).

Several
strategies have been reported to overcome the limitation
for the enzyme immobilization and facilitate enhanced direct electron
transfer (DET) process for metal NP-based biosensors.14 Pt NPs have been highly exploited for developing glucose
sensors15 and human metabolite detection.16 Nevertheless, the high cost of Pt significantly
limits its practical applications in biosensors. Therefore, many groups
have attempted to create Pt-based bimetallic NCs because of the possibility
to tune the Pt d-band structure, which correlates with the adsorption
strength of the catalyst surface, that is, Pt (100) surface through
the strain and ligand effects.6 Moreover,
bimetallic Pd@Pt core–shell nanocubes with sharp corners and
edges can significantly enhance the glucose oxidation activities.17 Pt/Pd alloy NPs exhibit enzyme-mimic activity
that can actively catalyze the H2O2 reduction
to detect H2O2 in various environments.18 Dumbbell-like PtPd–Fe3O4 NPs exhibit an enhanced sensitivity relative to individual
components for the continuous monitoring of H2O2 released from RAW264.7 cells.4,5 The enhancement in the
activity is not only due to the alloy structure and composition but
also due to the NP interface, which acts as a tuning factor to improve
the catalytic activity of the biosensor.19 So far, there have been limited studies on glucose monitoring and
the detection mechanism using Pd and Pt-based NCs as electrocatalytic
materials.

Engineering the metal NP surface by organic coatings
remarkably
improves the biocatalytic activity and preserves the structure of
glucose oxidase (GOx).20,21 Polymeric capping agents can
facilitate the incorporation of enzymes on the NP surface without
losing their activity, and the charge transfer between the electron
donar [flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)] and the surface of the electrode
is more efficient in amperometric enzyme-based glucose biosensors.22,23 The immobilization of the enzymes on the solid support is the critical
issue that strongly affects the biocatalytic activity and thus the
sensitivity of the biosensor.14,24 Numerous materials
have been developed such as block copolymers,25 conducting hydrogels,26 mesoporous silica,27 DNA scaffolds,28 bacteriophage,29 ionic liquids,30 metal–organic
frameworks,31 carbon nanotubes (CNTs),32 halloysite nanotubes,33 and graphene oxide (GO)34 as efficient
templates for effective immobilization, preserving the biocatalytic
activity of enzymes and facilitating DET. Among all, chitosan (CS)
biopolymers hold promise for the immobilization of enzymes not only
due to their active −NH3+/NH2 and −OH functional groups but also due to their high biocompatibility
and low cost.35,36 In our previous study, we have
shown that CS-stabilized silver nanowires show enhanced charge transfer
and stability for electrochemical detection of glucose.20 The Pd@Pt core–shell nanocubes covered
with CS provide synergizing activity of highly biocompatible CS and
excellent electrocatalytic activity, high surface area, and superior
binding affinity to biomolecules and, thus, are well-suited for the
design of biosensors with high sensitivity and stability.

Herein,
we report a facile, room-temperature route to synthesize
Pd@Pt core–shell nanocubes with conformal deposition of ultrathin
Pt shell (six atomic layers). The thickness of the Pt shells on the
Pd nanocubes could be precisely tuned by simply varying the concentration
of the Pt precursor. The key success of our synthesis strategy mainly
relies on using AA for fast reduction of Pt atoms by increasing the
pH of the reaction, which allows the control of the reduction kinetics.
Moreover, the resultant Pd@Pt NCs are covered with biocompatible CS
as an efficient covalent immobilization matrix for the enzymatic electrochemical
detection of glucose. We demonstrate remarkably enhanced sensitivity
and selectivity to detect glucose based on CS/Pd@Pt NC/GOx enzyme
electrodes.

2 Results and Discussion
A typical scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image
of the as-prepared Pd nanocubes and Pd@Pt nanocubes has an average
size of 13 nm, as shown in the STEM images, and a corresponding size
distribution histogram, as shown in Figure S1. Figure 1a,b shows
the STEM analysis of bare Pd nanocubes and Pd@Pt NCs revealing the
conformal deposition of Pt layers of a-few-atomic-layer thickness
onto the surface of each Pd nanocube. The high-angle annular dark-field
STEM (HAADF-STEM) image of the individual Pd@Pt NCs shows a clear
contrast between the Pd core and the subnanometer-thick Pt shell that
exhibits a periodic lattice plane extending across the entire surface,
suggesting the single-crystalline nature of the Pt shell (Figure 1c). These contrast
variations between the Pd core and Pt shell can be due to the large
difference in atomic numbers between Pd and Pt elements.37 Furthermore, the initial cubic shape of the
Pd NCs remains the same, indicating the controlled layer-by-layer
deposition of Pt. The atomic-resolution HAADF-STEM measurements for
the resultant Pd@Pt NCs reveal six atomic layers of Pt shell (Figure 1d). Varying from
6 atomic layers to 10 and 20 layers is feasible by altering the amount
of the Pt precursor solution from 0.1 to 0.25 mL and 0.5 mL, respectively
(Figure S2). The intensity-profiling analysis
(Figure 1e) along the
region shown in Figure 1d further confirms the Pd core and the six atomic layers of Pt shell
thickness. In addition, the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental
analysis and mapping (Figure S3) show the
presence of Pd and Pt elements, and the color difference between the
Pd core and Pt shell further confirms the homogeneous deposition of
Pt on the surfaces of Pd nanocubes. The Pt atomic ratio was
obtained using the inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy
(ICP-AES) analysis as 7.05% of Pt in the resultant Pd@Pt NCs. Furthermore,
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements indicate a presence
of both Pd and Pt elements with a Pt content of 7.15 wt % (Figure S4), which is consistent with the ICP
result.

HAADF-STEM image taken from the region marked by a box in (c), revealing

Previous reports have shown that because of the relatively
higher
standard reduction potential of PtCl62–/Pt [0.74 V vs rotation reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)] than
PdCl4/Pd (0.62 V vs RHE), the deposition of Pt on the Pd
nanocubes undergoes a galvanic replacement reaction, leading to the
formation of concave Pd@Pt core–shell NCs.38 Pt atoms can be uniformly deposited by heterogeneous nucleation
on the Pd cubes at higher temperatures (180 °C), in which the
homogeneous deposition with a well-defined shell thickness is largely
determined by the difference in the Pt deposition rate (Rdep) and the surface diffusion rate (Rdif).10,39 In our present synthesis strategy,
the deposition was done using a relatively strong reducing agent (AA)
at room temperature, allowing the reduction of Pt immediately and
selectively at the corner sites of the Pd nanocubes because of the
high-energy Pd {100} facets and then diffusing onto the side faces.
Therefore, the homogeneous deposition largely depends on the Rdif. The pH of the reaction system is found
to be critical for accelerating the surface diffusion of reduced Pt
atoms for uniform deposition. The reduction power of reducing agents
such as AA can be controlled by simply adjusting the pH value of the
reaction solution, and thus, the reaction kinetics can be easily altered.13 When the pH of the reaction solution is adjusted
to pH = 11, the surface diffusion of Pt atom is significantly enhanced,
thereby creating the condition of Rdep < Rdif. Consequently, the reduced
Pt atoms quickly diffuse onto the side faces to achieve a uniform
Pt shell with controlled thickness. By contrast, relatively lower
pH (pH = 4) under equivalent reaction conditions fails to produce
uniform deposition. Interestingly, the resultant products are concave
Pd@Pt core–shell NCs (Figure S5).
These results clearly demonstrate that the pH of the reaction system
plays a key role in modulating the reduction kinetics.

Fabrication
of the enzyme electrode based on CS/Pd@Pt NC/GOx-glassy
carbon electrode (GCE) comprises of three steps: preparation of the
Pd@Pt core–shell NCs, surface functionalization with CS, and
covalent immobilization of GOx enzyme (Scheme 1). Initially, the NCs were prepared and then
the CS biopolymer was used to functionalize through electrostatic
interactions. After coating the NCs with the CS polymer, small CS
layers encapsulated onto the NCs are formed, as can be seen in the
transmission electron microscope (TEM) image shown in Figure 2a. The presence of amino groups in the highly biocompatible and hydrophilic
CS permits covalent immobilization of GOx enzymes by reacting with
the bifunctional cross-linker glutaraldehyde (GA).35,40 The glucose-sensing principle of GOx-functionalized NCs is based
on the catalytic oxidation of glucose into gluconic acid and H2O2 in the presence of oxygen via an enzymatic reaction
(Scheme 1). The GOx
enzyme contains its active cofactor FAD bound to its two identical
80 kDa subunits. The efficient covalent immobilization of the GOx,
the FAD cofactors being electrically contacted properly, and minimizing
the electron-tunneling distance by bringing down the deeply buried
FAD are all key factors.41,42 As a result, DET between
the FAD center and the electrode surface is promoted and protection
from losing the biocatalytic function improves the lifetime.25,43 Homogeneous dispersion of Pd@Pt NCs in CS polymer catalyzes the
electrochemical oxidation of the enzymatically liberated H2O2 and promotes the enhanced charge transfer, thereby
resulting in the remarkable improvement in the sensitivity of the
resultant biosensor.

CS Biopolymer and the Covalent Immobilization of GOx to the CS by
Reacting with GA to Cross-Link the Amino Group of CS and the FAD Site
of GOx
The strategy for enzyme immobilization
is the key factor that affects
the biosensor performance by altering the charge transfer between
the FAD center and the electrode surface, modulating the electron-tunneling
distance and controlling the leaching effects.24,44 The CS contains an abundance of −HN3+/NH2 and −OH functional groups.20 The −NH-terminated surfaces were reacted with the
bifunctional compound GA to cross-link the −NH2 groups
of the GOx by covalent linkage.16,35 The NH2-terminated
surface of the CS was covalently linked by forming C–N bonds
to the amino groups on the GOx by reacting with the two aldehyde groups
on the GA.45 We confirmed the structural
interaction and immobilization of GOx enzymes with the CS/Pd@Pt NCs
using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy (Figure 2b). The GOx shows characteristic
transmittance bands at 1658, 1542, and 1103 cm–1 associated with the amide I and amide II absorption bands of the
proteins and the C–O stretching vibration of GOx, respectively.46 From the comparison of the spectra, the following
are evident: appearance of new peaks at 1643 cm–1 band for amide I (C=O stretching vibrations), at 1556 cm–1 for amide II (N–H bending vibrations), and
bands at 1410 cm–1 for −OH bending vibrations
upon GOx conjugation, suggesting the covalent binding through the
C–N bonds and retaining the secondary structure of GOx.47 In addition, dynamic light scattering (DLS)
and zeta potential measurements were recorded to characterize the
functionalization process. Table S1 presents
the results for the hydrodynamic diameter determined from DLS and
the corresponding surface charge obtained from the zeta potential
analysis. From the DLS, the bare Pd@Pt NCs show a diameter of 13 nm,
and this value increases to 17.3 nm after the CS coverage. At the
same time, the surface charge of the bare Pd@Pt NCs inverts from a
negative −1.02 mV to a positive value of 36.23 mV, suggesting
the increase in the size and stability upon CS coverage on the NCs.
After the immobilization of GOx, the diameter further increases to
37.1 nm, with a decrease in the zeta potential to 7.25 mV. The decrease
in the surface charge is due to the interaction of −NH groups
with the GOx enzyme through the GA molecules.40

Amperometric glucose detection using the fabricated electrode
was
performed using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry measurements
(CA). The CVs comparing the bare GCE, CS/Pd@Pt NC-GCE, and CS/Pd@Pt
NC/GOx-GCE in N2-saturated phosphate-buffered saline (PBS,
pH 7.4) at a scan rate of 50 mV·s–1 are shown
in Figure 3. The results
show that the bare GCE and CS/Pd@Pt NC-GCE exhibit no redox peaks
in the potential range of interest. Nevertheless, the CV of the CS/Pd@Pt
NC/GOx-GCE shows two well-defined redox peaks at cathodic (Epc) and anodic (Epa) peak potentials of −0.49 and −0.42 V, respectively.
These redox peak potentials are close to the standard oxidation and
reduction potentials of FAD/FADH2 of GOx.43,46 This result indicates that our modified
electrode can promote the DET between the electron donor (FAD) and
the electrode surface.

CS/Pd@Pt
NC/GOx-GCE (blue) in a N2-saturated PBS (pH = 7) at a scan
rate of 50 mV·s–1.

The enzyme coverage density (Γ, mol/cm2)
of the
immobilized GOx onto the CS/Pd@Pt NC/GOx-modified electrode can be
estimated by integrating the cathodic peak according to the following
equation.48 1  where Q is the charge consumed
in the redox reaction (obtained by integrating the anodic peak and
dividing by the scan rate of 50 mV·s–1), n is the number of electrons transferred (in this case, n = 2), F is the Faraday constant, and A is the geometric area of the GCE (0.07 cm2).
The estimated electroactive immobilized enzyme coverage on the electrode
is 4.2 × 10–8 mol/cm2. This value
is comparable to the previous report for covalent conjugation with
AuNPs, which supported the M13 bacteriophage (4.74 × 10–8 mol/cm2),29 and is higher
than those for GOx immobilized onto CS/carbon nanodots (8.78 ×
10–11 mol/cm2),49 graphene oxide (1.22 × 10–10 mol/cm2),50 TiO2 nanostructures (2.57
× 10–10 mol/cm2),51 and boron-doped CNT (1.94 × 10–9 mol/cm2).52

To investigate
the DET characteristics for the electrochemical
detection of glucose, we recorded CV measurements in oxygen (O2)-saturated 0.1 M PBS solution (pH 7.4) at a scan rate of
50 mV·s–1 in the presence of different concentrations
of glucose. Figure 4a shows the CVs along with the respective calibration plots (inset)
corresponding to the bio-electrocatalytic reduction of successive
addition of varying glucose concentrations. The reduction current
gradually decreases upon the addition of glucose, exhibits a linear
range between 1 and 6 mM, and saturates after 6 mM. It should be pointed
out that without covering with the CS, the bare Pd@Pt/GOx electrode
exhibits a rapid reduction in the low glucose concentration range
and reaches saturation quickly after 4 mM (Figure S6). This result indicates that the CS polymer confers stability
to the modified electrode and prevents inactivation of biocatalytic
functions, which enables an enhanced performance for glucose detection.
The sensitivity of the biosensor was measured using current–time
(i–t) curves at a constant
potential of −0.5 V versus saturated calomel electrode (SCE),
which is shown in Figure 4b. The electrocatalytic current decreases upon successive
addition of glucose and reaches a steady state with an average response
time of 5 s. Notably, we can see that the reduction current decreases
and saturates above 6 mM.

oxidation of different
concentrations of glucose by the GOx-immobilized CS/Pd@Pt NC/GOx-GCE.
CVs were recorded in PBS (0.1 M, pH 7.4) at a scan rate of 50 mV·s–1. (b) Current–time response curves for the

amperometric response of the CS/Pd@Pt NC/GOx-GCE in the presence of
variable concentration of glucose. (d) Linear calibration curves corresponding
to varying Pt shell thicknesses in the presence of different glucose
concentrations.

A typical steady-state
current as a function of glucose concentration
(Figure 4c) shows a
linear relationship in the 1–6 mM range, thus suggesting that
the sensor can be used in this concentration range for the continuous
monitoring of glucose. The observed low linear range can be attributed
to the combined effect of intrinsic peroxide activity catalyzed by
the enzymatic release of H2O2 and the competitive
oxygen consumption by glucose and FADH2.46 The linear range here is slightly broader compared with
that of Pt NPs supported on graphene and CS (0–5 mM).53 The sensitivity of the biosensor was calculated
to be 6.82 μA mM–1 cm–2,
which is relatively higher than those of other reported glucose biosensors
(Table 1). The sensitivity
of our biosensor is less compared with the Pt NP-based enzyme electrode;
the CS coating alters the reactivity of the Pd@Pt NCs and the conductivity,
which significantly decreases the charge transport. The glucose concentration
in the standard blood sample is approximately 4.89 mM.54 Our biosensor represents the linear relationship
between the steady-state current as a function of the concentration
of glucose (0.2–6 mM), which is higher than the average glucose
level in the blood. We also carried out additional experiments to
establish the detection limit of the biosensor, which was 0.2 μM
(Figure S7). This detection limit is also
significantly better than those of the other recently reported biosensors
(Table 1). The apparent
Michaelis–Menten constant (Km)
was determined to evaluate the biological activity of the immobilized
enzyme, which is estimated using Lineweaver–Burk equation as
follows46 2  where iss is the
steady-state current after the addition of glucose, imax is the maximum current under the saturated conditions,
and C is the bulk concentration of glucose. For a
given glucose concentration, the calculated Km is 0.58, which is very small compared with those of the previously
reported different nanostructure-based enzymatic glucose sensors presented
in Table 1. The relatively
low value of Km suggests a higher binding
affinity of the immobilized GOx to the CS/Pd@Pt core–shell
NC-based enzyme electrode and enzymatic activity. The excellent immobilized
GOx affinity for glucose can be attributed to the high biocompatibility
of CS, which preserves the biocatalytic function and the structure
of GOx.

Recent studies
have shown that the catalytic activity of the Pd@Pt
core–shell NCs is dramatically altered by varying Pt shell
thickness.8,10 This effect is attributed to the changes
in the adsorption strength of the NCs through surface strain arising
from the lattice mismatch between Pd and Pt and ligand effects.55 Therefore, we have examined the glucose-sensing
performance with different Pt shell thicknesses. Figure 4d shows the calibration plots
for the detection of glucose with three different Pt shell thicknesses.
The amperometric currents of the modified electrode are linearly dependent
upon glucose concentration (0–6 mM), which yields the sensitivity
values of 6.82, 6.172, and 5.303 μA cm–2 mM–1 for 6, 10, and 20 Pt atomic layers, respectively.
These results demonstrate that the Pd@Pt NCs with a few atomic layers
of Pt show a higher sensitivity to detect glucose, ascribed to the
significantly higher catalytic activity of the Pt shells with fewer
atomic layers.

To evaluate the stability of the biosensor, the
electrode was stored
at 4 °C in a 0.1 M PBS after use and tested every day for the
current response for 1 mM glucose for a 1 week period (Figure 5a). Our biosensor retained
approximately 80% of its original response over 7 days, indicating
excellent stability. The biosensor exhibits almost the same current
with identical glucose concentrations, thus pointing out a good stability
for practical applications. The biosensor is highly selective for
the detection of glucose. As shown in Figure 5b, addition of different interference substances
such as 1 mM AA, citric acid (CA), uric acid (UA), and lactic acid
(LA) results in negligible changes in the reduction current, whereas
an apparent response in the current is observed for the subsequent
addition of 1 mM glucose, suggesting an excellent anti-interference
ability of the Pd@Pt NC/GOx-based biosensor.

3 Conclusions
We have
demonstrated a platform based on CS-covered Pd@Pt core–shell
NCs for the sensitive electrochemical detection of glucose. The new
room-temperature synthesis methodology is exploited for depositing
ultrathin shells of Pt on the Pd nanocubes to obtain uniform Pd@Pt
core–shell nanocubes. The covering of CS on the nanocubes allows
the covalent linkage of GOx enzyme, which not only promotes DET but
also confers stability and preserves biocatalytic functions of GOx.
The biosensor here is capable of glucose detection with a high sensitivity
of 6.82 μA cm–2 mM–1, a
linear range of 1–6 mM, and a fast response time (approximately
5 s). Moreover, the sensor shows high stability and specificity toward
different interfering compounds. This biosensor platform offers many
advantages such as low cost, superior electrocatalytic activity, significant
enhancement in charge transport, and high sensitivity in detecting
glucose.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
CS (medium molecular weight Mw = 300
kDa, 82% degree of deacetylation), sodium
tetrachloropalladate (II) (Na2PdCl4), potassium
tetrachloroplatinate (II) (K2PtCl4), potassium
bromide (KBr, 99%), poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP, Mw of 55 000), l-ascorbic acid (AA, 99%),
GOx (from Aspergillus niger), d (+) glucose, CA (≥99%), UA (≥99%), LA (≥99%),
sucrose (≥99%), and GA (50%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Acetic acid (glacial, 99–100%) was purchased from Merck. All
reagents were of analytical grade and used as received. Ultrapure
deionized (DI) water (resistivity of 18 MΩ·cm) was used
throughout all experiments.

4.2 Synthesis of Pd@PtnL Core–Shell
NCs
The Pd nanocube seeds with an average edge length of
13 nm were synthesized using a previously described method.56 In a typical synthesis, 15 mL of aqueous solution
containing PVP, l-ascorbic acid (60 mg), KBr (300 mg), and
Na2PdCl4 (57 mg) was prepared and heated for
3 h at 80 °C under magnetic stirring. After that, the reaction
mixture was cooled to room temperature, and then the resultant products
were centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 10 min and were washed with
DI water to obtain Pd nanocubes. For the synthesis of Pd@Pt core–shell
NCs, the Pd nanocubes were used as seeds for conformal deposition
of Pt. In a typical procedure, 100 mg of AA and 66.6 mg of PVP were
dissolved in 15 mL of DI water in a vial, followed by adding 2.5 mL
of aqueous suspension of Pd nanocubes, and the mixture was stirred
well. After that, 0.5 mL of sodium hydroxide (0.2 M) was added to
increase the pH of the reaction to 11. The mixture was magnetically
stirred for 15 min, and then, another aqueous solution (0.1 mL) containing
K2PtCl4 (0.1 M) was added slowly to the vial
to obtain Pd@Pt core–shell NCs. Varying the Pt atomic layers
on the Pd cubes was done by simply changing the concentration of K2PtCl4 from 0.1 to 0.25 mL and 0.5 mL.

4.3 Covering of Pd@Pt NCs with CS Biopolymer and
Covalent Immobilization of GOx
The CS solution was obtained
by dissolving 1 g of CS powder in a 1% acetic acid solution, as described
in our previous work.20 The CS coating
on the resultant NCs was performed by stirring 5 mg of Pd@Pt nanocubes
in 1 mL of CS solution (1 wt %) for 30 min. The covalent immobilization
of GOx on the CS-covered Pd@Pt NCs was accomplished by reacting with
1 mL of GA (50%), and the suspension was magnetically stirred for
2 h, followed by the addition of 0.2 mL of GOx enzyme (40 mg/mL in
PBS); the resultant solution was allowed to react overnight. The GOx-immobilized CS/Pd@Pt NCs were then stored for the preparation
of the enzyme electrode.

4.4 Preparation of the Enzyme
Electrode
GCEs (d = 3 mm, homemade) were
polished with 1.0,
0.3, and 0.05 μm alumina powders to obtain a mirror surface.
The GCE was rinsed thoroughly with DI water between each polishing
step and sequential ultrasonication in a DI/acetone mixture and then
dried with a nitrogen stream. After drying, 30 μL
of covalently immobilized GOx on the CS/Pd@Pt NCs was deposited on
the surface of the cleaned GCE and left to dry at 4 °C for at
least 4 h. The fabricated modified enzyme electrodes were stored at
4 °C in a refrigerator under dry conditions when not in use.

4.5 Material Characterization
The morphology
of the Pd nanocubes and Pd@Pt NCs was analyzed by TEM using a JEOL
JEM-1010 instrument operated at 80 kV by drop-casting the resultant
NCs on the Cu grids and drying at room temperature. HAADF-STEM analyses were obtained using JEM ARM 200F equipment
operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The covalent immobilization
and the interaction of GOx with the CS/Pd@Pt NCs were identified using
FT-IR spectroscopy using a Perkin Elmer spectrophotometer with an
attenuated total reflection accessory in the range of 4000–650
cm–1. Electrochemical measurements were recorded
on an electrochemical workstation (VoltaLab 40 PGZ 301). The DLS and
zeta potential measurements were recorded using Nano ZS (Malvern).

4.6 Electrochemical Measurements
All
electrochemical experiments were carried out using a VoltaLab 40 PGZ
301 electrochemical workstation with a conventional standard three-electrode
cell. The homemade GCE used as the working electrode was cleaned well
before and after each experiment. A platinum foil and an SCE were
used as the auxiliary and the reference electrodes, respectively.
The electrochemical glucose-sensing measurements of the modified electrodes
were recorded using CV and recorded in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4) at room
temperature. The PBS buffer solution was purged with oxygen for at
least 20 min before the measurements. The chronoamperometric measurements
were recorded at a fixed potential of −0.5 V.
