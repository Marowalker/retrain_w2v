Open-surface
microfluidics is promising in terms of enabling economical
and rapid biochemical analysis for addressing challenges associated
with medical diagnosis and food safety. To this end, we present a
simple and economical approach to develop an open-surface microfluidic
platform suitable for facile liquid transport and mixing. Customizable
patterns with tailored wettability are deposited using a plasma-assisted
deposition technique under atmospheric pressure. The flow of the dispensed
liquid is driven by gravity, and the tilting angle of the device determines
the extent of mixing. First, a hexamethyldisiloxane film was deposited
to create hydrophobic patterns on glass, and then, hydrophilic acrylic
acid was deposited by a patterned cardboard mask to construct a channel
suitable for forming channels to transport aqueous liquids without
the need of an external energy input; the liquid can be confined to
designated pathways. Several designs including Y-junctions, serpentine-shaped
patterns, splitting channels, and concentration gradient generation
patterns are presented. The proposed method can spatially pattern
a surface with a hydrophobic/hydrophilic area, which can function
as a microfluidic channel, and the surface can be applied in microfluidic
devices with other types of substrates.

Introduction
In recent years, biosensors
have drawn considerable research attention
because of their potential to rapidly diagnose several diseases. Notable
biosensor types include a surface plasmon resonance biosensor,1 a silicon nanowire field-effect transistor,2 and a quartz crystal microbalance.3 The underlying working mechanisms of various
biosensors, including their simplicity and ease of implementation,
are crucial in the design of sensing devices. Furthermore, clinical
specimens must be transported to the sensing area of the device through
a reliable microfluidic system.4−6

Among these diagnostic platforms,
open-surface microfluidic systems
have become increasingly popular because of their potential for use
in point-of-care diagnostics and lab-on-chip applications.7−9 Compared with other microfluidic systems, open-surface microfluidics
have emerged as a user friendly approach to construct multifunctional
devices.10−13 For instance, open-surface microfluidics can be integrated with
other advanced analytical techniques such as electrochemical sensing
and fluorescence detection.10 The simplicity
of the fabrication technique bears critical importance with respect
to the development of open-surface microfluidic technologies.11 In such open-surface microfluidic systems, gravity-driven
fluid transport that does not require any external energy input is
of particular interest. Typically, a wettability contrast can be created
by depositing a hydrophilic pattern onto a hydrophobic substrate,
thereby enabling localized entrapment.12,13 As such, the
liquid flows to the designated hydrophilic area owing to surface tension.14 The liquid movement can be manipulated by synchronizing
the effects of surface energy, liquid surface tension, and device
geometry.15 For example, Melin et al. proposed
the application of an open microchannel system in a pressure-driven
continuous flow.16 The proposed device
structure comprised a glass substrate with a 100 μm-thick polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS) film. The open part of the channel was cut into the PDMS layer.
This open structure of the demonstrated system leverages the benefits
of accessibility and reliability when employed in microfluidic systems.
Berthier et al.17 reported the use of a
capillary-driven microfluidic system, wherein a spontaneous capillary
flow can be established within the suspended channel of an open-surface
substrate. A long, suspended channel was fabricated by milling through
a 1 mm-thick PMMA plate, where liquid flow was suspended between two
parallel vertical walls.

Thus far, hydrophilic tracks have been
created using surface-modification
techniques, such as UV irradiation,15 photochemical
grafting,18 and chemical vapor deposition19 under vacuum conditions to modify surface properties.
The use of an atmospheric-pressure plasma jet (APPJ) allows for the
deposition of heavily cross-linked films on various surfaces sans
the need for a high-vacuum environment and associated pumping (chamber
system). The APPJ treatment20 is a dry
process that generates plasma under atmospheric conditions, thereby
saving money and time. In addition to these advantages, the process
is rapid and environmentally friendly.21 The APPJ treatment is suitable for integration in inline processes
and can also be used for surface property control applications, such
as surface activation and coating.21−24 The APPJ facilitates the facile
creation of hydrophilic channels by employing a simple cardboard-based
mask.25−27

Plasma-polymerized hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO)
is a widely used
material because of its characteristics, such as good adherence to
glass, high chemical stability, transparency, and scratch resistance.
More importantly, HMDSO deposition on glass renders modified surfaces
hydrophobic, as evidenced by a water contact angle exceeding 90°.
Hydrophobic surfaces are generally used considering their ability
to repel biological specimens. Therefore, plasma-deposited HMDSO is
considered a suitable material for use in biochip manufacturing.28 Acrylic acids (AACs) not only impart hydrophilicity
to surfaces but also facilitate surface functionalization, which is
advantageous for sensing and diagnostic purposes. For example, deoxyribonucleic
acid (DNA) can be covalently conjugated to carboxylic acid groups
present in AAC-based films, which in turn facilitates the detection
of RNA/DNA fragments and antibodies.29

The present study describes the development of a new methodology
for fabricating an open-surface microfluidic device via APPJ-assisted
deposition. Hydrophilic AAC tracks were deposited atop an HMDSO layer
and subsequently cross-linked to form a bilayer structure. This proposed
technique explores the concept of leveraging wettability-patterned
surfaces to facilitate directional liquid transport along designated
hydrophilic channels (Figure 1).

open-surface microfluidic platform setup; the two types of wettability
precursors used to form open-surface microfluidic by plasma patterning:
AAC-modified (top layer) and HMDSO-modified (bottom layer) on glass.

Results and Discussion
Characterization of HMDSO-
and AAC-Modified Surfaces
As already described, using the
APPJ approach, glass surfaces were
hydrophobized herein by depositing a thin HMDSO layer and by exposing
sample surfaces to HMDSO plasma for 180 s. The deposited HMDSO layer
thickness was estimated as 124 ± 9 nm, as characterized via ellipsometry
conducted using the HMDSO-coated silicon wafers prepared under identical
deposition conditions. The equilibrium contact angles (θC) were measured using the sessile drop method with water as
the probing liquid. As observed, the HMDSO-coated glass surfaces exhibited
an average θC value of 90.5 ± 5.8°, approximately
1.5 h after coating. As indicated by the value of θC measuring less than 5°, the corresponding glass surfaces became
extremely hydrophilic upon elapse of 4 min after the AAC plasma treatment
of the HMDSO-modified glass samples (Figure 2a,b).

Figure 2 (a) Schematic of the deposition process.
The left side of (a) shows
the plasma jet settings for different precursors; (b) changes in the
contact angles of the HMDSO and AAC films under different exposure
times in air; and (c) transmission spectrum response of the HMDSO
and AAC thin-film coatings. The table in (c) lists the film haze (%)
as a function of the carrier gas flow rate. Haze is the percentage
of the incident light exceeding 2.5° to that of the total transmitted
light.

Three situations (i.e., surface
contamination, free-radical surface
energy transfer, and surface energy transfer of the material itself
to the rough layer or substrate) could possibly arise, consequently
causing the surface energy to drop and the corresponding contact angle
to increase.30 Plasma treatment parameters
that could obtain the highest contact angle when forming a HMDSO film
are adopted. Table 1 lists the experimental parameters in detail. Figure 2b depicts the changes induced in the contact
angle of the HMDSO and AAC films under conditions of different exposure
times in air. The experimental results demonstrated that both HMDSO-
and AAC-film surfaces effectively maintained their hydrophobic or
hydrophilic ability for up to 96 h. The hydrophobic functional groups
are deposited on the surface by a dissociation plasma reaction, and
the surface is dominated by the formation of a hydrophobic functional
CH3 group. In this study, clean dried air (CDA) is used
as the main gas, and oxygen in the CDA participates in the reaction.
There are partial hydrophilic groups or long half-life free radicals
deposited into the hydrophobic structure. After a certain amount of
time, once the hydrophilic groups and the free radicals react with
the air to lose their activity (surface passivation), the characteristics
of the hydrophobic functional groups are fully expressed; thus, the
contact angle increases. Therefore, when the surface passivates and
hydrophobic recovery occurs, the hydrophobic properties rapidly manifest.
The rise of the contact angle is approximately 40°. Compared
with the hydrophobic part, no other hydrophobic functional group reacts
with the deposition process, after the hydrophilic surface is passivated;
solely, the airborne contaminants lead to the hydrophobic recovery.
The hydrophilic group, after the HMDSO coating is completed, is fixed
on it by AAC to increase the hydrophilic group of the surface. When
the hydrophilic group is corroborated to be fixed on the surface,
the hydrophilicity will soon be determined. The contact angle is observed
to be >10°. Similarly, during this process, some active plasma
reactants or nonbonded molecules remain on the surface; thus, the
contact angle will increase when hydrophobic recovery occurs. However,
the AAC molecules that have been immobilized on the surface exert
a hydrophilic effect; therefore, there is a smaller increase in the
contact angle (approximately 15–20°).

On tilting
the glass substrate by 30°, the droplet flowed
along the HMDSO- and AAC-modified glass without diffusion. We first
drop 5 μL water droplets on the tilting substrate and then measured
the contact angle of the droplet on the track surface, a HMDSO-modified
hydrophobic film with an AAC-modified hydrophilic film on glass. The
receding angle (uphill) and advancing angle (downhill) are measured
as 28.5 ± 5.5 and 22.5 ± 3.5°, respectively, as shown
in Figure S1.

The optical transparency
of the modified glass was evaluated by
measuring the transmittance in the wavelength range of 300–900
nm via an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reader (Figure 2c). The plasma-polymerized
HMDSO- and AAC-modified glasses exhibited a nearly constant transmittance
when compared with that of the unmodified glass. This result suggests
that plasma-induced deposition is a versatile technique for depositing
a thin layer of optically transparent HMDSO coating. The best parameter
combination determined herein corresponded to 400 W of plasma power,
0.125 standard liters per minute (slpm) flow rate of the carrier gas,
and 15 mm of nozzle-to-glass distance. Using the above-mentioned combination
of parameter values, the deposited SiOx film demonstrated
light transmittance exceeding 90% with a corresponding water droplet
contact angle of 90°, which ensured the manifestation of the
hydrophobicity of the coated glass. Accordingly, the haze of films
was measured using a haze machine (Figure 2c). The film haze tended to influence the
scattering rate. A film-coating penetration exceeding 90% and a contact
angle greater than 90° were considered as the optimum parameters
herein. In addition, the experimental design revealed that the carrier
gas flow rate significantly affected the contact angle. For instance,
the contact angle was observed to have reduced to 85° (below
expectations) when the flow rate decreased to 0.100 slpm. The corresponding
film haze significantly increased (10.1% at 0.150 slpm in comparison
with 3.16% at 0.125 slpm) when the flow rate increased to 0.150 slpm,
although the contact angle only increased to 92°. Thus, a carrier
gas flow rate of 0.125 slpm for HMDSO was considered optimum. Furthermore,
the carrier flow rates had no influence on the transparency and haze
for AAC. These results indicate that surface modification with AAC
plasma can indeed impart surface hydrophilicity, which is important
for creating patterns suitable for inducing surface-tension-driven
flow, while optical transparency ensures that the device remains suitable
for use in optical characterization techniques.

The surface
characterization of the samples at each process stage
was conducted via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (VG Scientific
Microlab 350) using Al Kα1,2 (1486.6 eV) excitation. The corresponding
energy resolution was approximately 0.1 eV. Figure 3 depicts the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) results obtained for surface elements comprising twin-layered
films of HMDSO–glass and AAC–HMDSO–glass. The
survey-scan spectra were constructed at a pass energy of 20 eV, while
individual spectra for C 1s, Si 2p, and O 1s were fixed at a pass
energy of 20 eV with a 0.1 eV energy step. Figure 3 shows that the chemical bonds mainly consisted
of C–H and C–C functional groups. Furthermore, the surface
still contained a few exposed CH3 groups; hence, the contact
angle of this specimen reached 90° in the contact angle measurements.
Clean dried air (CDA) plasma was used to oxidize and remove all CH3 groups on the HMDSO surface prior to the gaseous coating
of AAC to ensure that AAC successfully binds to HMDSO. In Table 2, most contaminants
on the glass surface were eliminated via plasma treatment (C 1s atom
<3%). However, the oxygen content of the surface was greater than
Si/O = 1:2 (the Si/O ratio of the pure glass SiO2 structures)
because of the oxidizing effects of plasma. When HMDSO is plated,
as the main structure of HMDSO is O[Si(CH3)3]2, the content of C 1s increases to 10.4%. In the following process, CH3 reacts
with oxygen in CDA to form a gaseous molecule of H2O and
CO2 escapes, so it drops to 3.15%, and the oxidized component
increases, so the oxygen is increased to 68.81%. When preparing AAC,
the main gas used is also CDA; thus, plating AAC may also cause the
CH3 group of the surface to come off the surface again.
Therefore, when preparing AAC, the selected plasma wattage is close
to the lowest excitation wattage of the machine, which is 350 W (as
summarized in Table 1). The contact angle reduced to 16° after AAC coating because
of the presence of COOH polar groups on the surface. In addition,
the carbon content of the surface was quite low because AAC reacted
with CDA (working gas) to form gases like CO2 during the
atmospheric plasma spraying process. Moreover, only a fraction of
the AAC molecules was retained by the surface. The AAC introduced
in the XPS chart shows the presence of COOH functional groups, but
overall the proportion of carbon is reduced (2.71%) and the oxidized
portion is also reduced (66.28%), indicating that some of the original
surface of CH3 or AAC fragments still form a gaseous detachment
surface; thus, the Si ratio increases slightly. Table 2 summarizes the elemental compositions of
the samples.

Design Configuration
The aluminum plate is a rigid
and good material to serve as a mask for hydrophobic/hydrophilic patterning
(Figure 4a). However,
an aluminum-based mask is relatively expensive and requires a precise
computer numerical control milling process to create desirable patterns.
Interestingly, high-resolution patterns (i.e., 30–200 μm
wide) using a shadow metal mask and plasma coating are achieved in Figure 4b. Figure 4b shows optical microscopic
images of the patterned film created using a shadow mask. The disadvantages
of this method include high cost and a complicated process for mask
fabrication. Therefore, a rapid and low-cost mask preparation approach
is required. We employed herein a laser cutter to prepare a patterned
cardboard to be used as a mask for generating hydrophilic channels.
Using a cardboard is beneficial because it is inexpensive. The usage
of the laser cutter facilitates rapid prototyping in an economical
manner. A minimum line width of 0.3 mm can be achieved herein, and
this was within the achievable value limited by the operational range
of the laser cutter (Figure 2a). The same approach can be used to pattern various substrates,
including glass, silicon wafer, aluminum, plastic (polyethylene terephthalate
(PET)), and acrylic (poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)) plates (Figure 4c).

Figure 4 Design of masks and patterns
on different substrates: (a) aluminum
mask, (b) shadow mask, and (c) patterns on different substrates (i.e.,
glass, silicon wafer, aluminum, plastic (PET), and acrylic (PMMA)
plates).

Microfluidic channels were manufactured
using atmospheric-plasma-assisted
coatings by employing simple cardboard masks. Unlike the conventional
photolithography fabrication of a closed microfluidic device, open
microfluidic device fabrication avoids the need for chip bonding.
An atmospheric-plasma-assisted patterning method was used to simplify
the fabrication process, and a virtual wall, instead of a physical
microchannel, was constructed. The mask configurations designed for
common microfluidic channels in a closed microfluidic device are discussed
below. Four different configurations were designed in this study.
A prototype of the mask to be used in various microfluidic applications
was fabricated in accordance with the design depicted in Figure S2. The said mask was used to fabricate
patterns such as straight, mixing, and splitting, with no branching
points. In devices comprising grading channels, such as concentration
gradient generators (CGGs), many merged channels flow orthogonally.
We fabricated the mask featuring two parts, comprising a network of
vertical and horizontal channels. Thus, two different mask layers
were required to be fabricated and precisely aligned. The first mask
layer was attached by aligning it to the rear side of the glass. Figure 5a depicts the design
of the first layer mask demonstrating a CGG pattern with branched
cuts. The second mask layer presented a geometry identical to the
CGG pattern, albeit sans branched cuts. The upper limit of the number
of masks to be used is two for all microfluidic pattern geometry applications.

along different patterns (i.e., straight, mixing, splitting,
and merging channels) (450 pixels = 1 cm) and (b) red–green–blue
(RGB) analysis of the flow. Moreover, the inserted graphs inside the
splitting graph and grading graph are the inlet flow distributions
of the RGB analysis.

Liquid Transport and Mixing
on the Proposed Platform
The device was tilted, and gravity
was used for driving the fluid
flow. The experiment was conducted by setting the tilt angle to 30°
in all of the experiments except when observing different flow rates
in grading channels that are tilted by 70° (Figure S3). The force of gravity on the liquid was observed
to be greater when the inclination angle and/or volume flow rate were
increased. The experiment was conducted by setting the tilt angle
of grading channels to 70° to observe the influence on grading.

The possibility of a laminar flow through hydrophilic channels
of diverse shapes at low volume flow rates is discussed in the paragraphs
that follow (Figure 5a).The color composition included red, green, and blue. During the
RGB analysis of the image, the inlet RGB was set as Ri,
Gi, and Bi, while the outlet RGB was set as
Ro, Go, and Bo. Figure 5b depicts the analysis of liquid
transport and mixing on the platform. If the value of R/B exceeded
1, more of the yellow color could be observed within channels. Meanwhile,
R/B measured less than one. More of the blue color was correspondingly
observed. A laminar flow was maintained at the Y-junction (straight
line). A single color was observed for the Y-junctions (straight channels)
depicted in Figure 5a,b. In the serpentine-shaped microfluidic channels, the R/B color
ratio on the left inlet was observed to exceed unity, while that on
the right inlet measured less than one. No single color distribution
was observed at the outlet of the mixing channels. The observed RGB
distribution changed from being symmetric at the inlet to radial at
the outlet, thereby denoting that the colors tended to mix.

Regarding the splitting-pattern channels, a single color was observed
at the Y-junction in the straight channel within which a laminar flow
was maintained. For the inlets at the Y-junctions, the R/B color ratio
at the left inlet exceeded one, whereas that at the right inlet measured
less than unity. As observed, the color distribution maintained a
single color at the outlet. At the splitting channel, four peaks were
observed in the RGB distribution. The R/B ratio at each channel was
1.09:2.02:1.05:0.95, thereby indicating that liquid color on the three
left outlets demonstrated a more yellow tint, whereas that on the
right outlet demonstrated a more bluish tint.

In the two-inlet–four-outlet
grading channel network, the
two streams injected into the inlets were mixed with neighboring streams
in different manners as they flowed through the grading channel network
on the open surface. A laminar flow was observed in the straight line
when the left (yellow colored) and right (blue-colored) streams flowed
from their respective inlets toward the Y-junction (inlet to the B
= 1 layer). The two-colored streams were observed to flow toward the
left and right sides at the first branch point. Thereafter, the said
streams were divided into splitting channels (V =
0, 3). The R/B ratio in the V = 3 channel was equal
to 1.24, whereas that in the V = 0 channel was equal
to 0.84. After splitting, the two streams recombined in the merging
channel on the B = 2 layer. The R/B ratio was equal to 0.45 in the V = 1 channel and 1.62 in the V = 2 channel.
In a system of grading channels, the RGB distribution of the color
produced in each of the split channels was observed to correspond
to the situation wherein liquid flow was directed within the constraints
of a patterned virtual hydrophobic wall. Figure S3 indicates that even with the tilt angle being increased
to 70° the grading channels maintained their microfluidic function
with the liquid flow rate varying in the range of 1–40 mL/min,
as shown in Figure S3 (see the Supporting Information (SI)). The results showed
that each device had an ability function (Y for separating, S for
mixing and splitting, and CGG for different color distribution gradients
produced). The proposed open-surface microfluidic platform fabricated
using APPJ exhibits great potential for use in disease diagnosis applications.
In the case of a hydrophobic film, due to film deposition under atmospheric
pressure, the HMDSO film does not exhibit oleophobic characteristics.21 The hydrophobic angle of the n-hexadecane on the HMDSO-modified film is 26°, owing to which
the device is more suitable for water-based solutions. Both the AAC
film and the HMDSO film are oleophilic. In the oil wettability sample,
an oleophobic substrate such as tempered glass can be served as the
substrate applied for the oil wettability system. Under a tilt angle
of 30°, the yellow oil dye (paraffin oil) and the blue water
liquid are mixed at the Y-junction and oil droplets generated in the
channel by the shear force, as shown in Figure S4 (SI).

A qualitative mixing (diffusion) test was conducted
as shown in Figure S5 (SI). The hydrophilic
track was divided
to separate reactant area and then coated with a protein assay dye
and bovine serum albumin (BSA), respectively. On tilting the substrate
at 30°, we observed that the device allowed different regions
of the liquid to react and the mixing and reaction times could be
controlled by the length of gaps. The liquid front came through a
gap of 2 mm in nearly 1.5 s. We observed the mixing (diffusion) reaction;
the color turned from red to blue as the liquid diffused from the
protein region to the dye region but did not spread. Finally, the
device can be reused by washing with deionized water.

Conclusions
This study reported the development and use of a simple, low-cost,
and economical method for fabricating open-surface microfluidic platforms.
The proposed design strategy is surface-material-independent and can
be equally applied to sapphire, PET, PMMA, and silicon wafers. The
APPJ treatment represents an alternate method designed to meet the
ever-increasing need to develop a low-cost, easy-to-manufacture microfluidic
prototype. Four different device types were fabricated herein. The
experimental results obtained demonstrated differences in the wettability
of the patterned films and the possibility for laminar flow on these
four types. The contact angle measured more than 90.5 ± 5.8°
for the hydrophobic film and less than 16° for the hydrophilic
films for the same aging time. In conclusion, the proposed method
of fabricating patterned films for microfluidic channels possesses
the ability of confining liquid to flow along the designated pathways.
This methodology may be equally applied to other substrates, oil-based
solutions, and qualitative mixing considered to be of potential interest
in microfluidic applications.

Experimental Section
Materials
HMDSO
and AAC were purchased from Alfa Aesar
and used as received (condition purity >98%). Food color dye tartrazine
(Food Drugs and Cosmetic Yellow No. 4), yellow oil dye (paraffin oil),
and Brilliant Blue FCF (Food Drugs and Cosmetic Blue No. 1) were purchased
from First Chemical Co., Ltd. (Taiwan). BSA was purchased from Promega
Madison, WI. The protein assay dye reagent concentrate was purchased
from Bio-Rad (cat. #50000006).

Fabrication of the Open-Surface
Microfluidic Platform
A glass slide was used as a substrate
for fabricating the proposed
open-surface microfluidic platform. The slide measuring 7.6 ×
2.6 × 0.1 cm3 was cleaned with isopropyl alcohol and
CDA plasma. A cardboard mask (7.6 × 2.6 × 0.1 cm3) was fabricated using a laser-cutting machine (Taiwan 3 Axle Technology
Co., Ltd./DC5030B). The coatings were deposited using an APPJ system
(Figure 1). The coating
procedure was conducted using an atmospheric plasma jet with a mixture
of the main gas (CDA) and precursors. CDA was used as the working
gas to generate plasma in all experiments, and the flow rate of the
main gas CDA was 40 slpm. HMDSO and AAC were used as precursors (Figure 2a). The surface was
first activated by CDA plasma and then hydrophobized using HMDSO by
injecting it into the plasma generating chamber at the end of the
nozzle using Ar as the carrier gas on a water bath (temperature, 36
°C). The scanning times are 10 and 1 for CDA activation and HMDSO
deposition, respectively. The carrier gas flow rates were controlled
using a mass-flow controller (ALICAT MC Series). The flow rate of
carrier gas was set as 0.125 slpm for HMDSO. A patterned cardboard
mask dimension of 7.6 × 2.6 × 0.1 cm3 was subsequently
clamped onto the HMDSO-modified glass. Prior to the coating of the
AAC film, CDA plasma was used to activate the surface that was clamped
by the mask. Track-patterned hydrophilic layers were deposited on
the hydrophobic HMDSO film using AAC as a precursor with a carrier
gas flow rate of 0.3 slpm on a water bath temperature of 60 °C.
The sweep times of scan injection for the AAC layer as well as the
CDA plasma depend on the shaped patterns. The working distance between
the jet and the sample was set as 15 mm. AC power was used as the
plasma power supply in all experiments, with a 1–600 W output
power range; the frequency was fixed at 35 kHz. Table 1 summarizes the experimental parameters used
during the fabrication of the proposed open-surface microfluidic devices.
The mean total time of fabrication is 16 min; out of this, it takes
1 min to cut a mask, 1 min to prepare the plasma jet equipment, 1
min to expose the sample surfaces to CDA plasma, and 3 and 10 min
to deposit the HMDSO and AAC layers, respectively (the scan time for
the AAC layer depends on the pattern shaped; the average time is 10
min).

Characterization of the APPJ Films
All film thicknesses
were measured via ellipsometry (Mission Peak Optics, Inc., MP100-ST).
The water contact angles in air were measured using the sessile drop
method employing a contact angle system (First Ten Angstroms 125)
with a drop size of 5 μL and a contact angle (θC) measured at least 10 times to obtain the mean value and the corresponding
standard deviation. Transmittance measurements were conducted using
an ELISA reader (Thermo Scientific, Multiskan TM, Go). The haze of
films was measured using a haze machine (Gardner BYK). The surface
functional groups of the modified films were measured via X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (VG Scientific Microlab 350). The film was exposure to
atmospheric oxygen, between the sample preparation and insertion into
XPS chamber, for a maximum of 0.5 h.

Liquid Transport and Mixing
Test
Aqueous solutions
were dyed using food color. Streams of yellow- and blue-colored water
at their respective inlets were mixed together in channels of 1 mm
width using syringe pumps at a volume flow rate of 10 μL/min
and driven by gravity from the tilt platform at 30°. The two
streams were made to enter from the top inlets at the same flow rate
and mixed as they flowed downstream. Oil solutions were dyed using
oil dye and flow at the above-mentioned parameters. We set up a cell
phone parallel to the tilt plate to take photographs. The color information
was obtained by an image-analysis software (ImageJ, ver. 1.52a). For
a qualitative mixing (diffusion) test, we coated a track with a 1
μL of 5× diluted protein assay dye and 20 μg of bovine
serum albumin (BSA) at temperatures of 80 and 37 °C for 30 and
10 min, respectively. Deionized water (5 μL) was flown from
the BSA-coated region to the protein assay dye-coated region when
the platform was slid at a tilt angle of 30°.
