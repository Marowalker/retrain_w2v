An irradiated turbid medium scatters
the light in accordance to
its optical properties. Near-infrared (NIR) clinical methods, which
are based on spectral-dependent absorption, suffer from an inherent
error due to spectral-dependent scattering. We present here a unique
spatial point, that is, iso-pathlength (IPL) point, on the surface
of a tissue at which the intensity of re-emitted light remains constant.
This scattering-indifferent point depends solely on the medium geometry.
On the basis of this natural phenomenon, we suggest a novel optical
method for self-calibrated clinical measurements. We found that the
IPL point exists in both cylindrical and semi-infinite tissue geometries
(Supporting Information, Video file). Finally, in vivo human finger
and mice measurements are used to validate the crossing point between
the intensity profiles of two wavelengths. Hence, measurements at
the IPL point yield an accurate absorption assessment while eliminating
the scattering dependence. This finding can be useful for oxygen saturation
determination, NIR spectroscopy, photoplethysmography measurements,
and a wide range of optical sensing methods for physiological aims.

1 Introduction
Diagnosis
of a physiological state by extracting optical parameters
of tissues, as implemented in near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, optical
coherence tomography, fluorescence, etc.,1−5 is widespread. However, human tissue, which is a
turbid medium, poses a challenge for the different optical methods.
Light reflectance from a tissue has spectral-dependent absorption
and scattering.6 Hence, evaluating absorption-dependent
physiological parameters requires calibration of the scattering to
obtain accurate information. Methods for extracting optical properties
from the reflected light are based on either the amplitude in multiple
sources or multiple point measurements. Most methods are complex and
based on modulated sources with phase, time, and frequency analyses.7

Pulse oximetry is one of the most common
point-of-care tests because
it is noninvasive, characterized by high speed, and can be interpreted
even without a physician. It uses two light sources for extracting
blood saturation, pressure, and perfusion on the basis of ratiometric
absorption measurements. The change in optical properties due to wavelength
produces a difference in the optical path. Hence, at different wavelengths,
a position on the surface of the medium has an intensity that is influenced
by a different optical path.

The full scattering profile (FSP),
which is the angular intensity distribution,8,9 is
a new point of view for extracting optical properties of cylindrical
tissues using a simple system containing a continuous wave source
and a photodetector (PD). The FSP of cylindrical tissues is relevant
to biomedical measurement of fingers, earlobes, or pinched tissues.
Using the FSP, the iso-pathlength
(IPL) point phenomenon is revealed; an IPL point is a point on the
surface of a cylindrical medium where the light intensity remains
constant and does not depend on the reduced scattering coefficient
of the medium but on the spatial structure. This phenomenon serves
as a self-calibration point because the intensity there is influenced
by absorption regardless of the scattering and thus improves the accuracy
of the optical property extraction. Moreover, we presented a linear
dependency between the radius of the tissue and the point’s
location.

Most existing instruments do not deal with the FSP
but rather focus
only on the reflection or transmission of light. The novel finding
of the IPL point, to the best of our knowledge, has not been reported
before this research. However, we have found supporting reports on
reflection from a semi-infinite medium in diffusion reflection (DR)10,11 and reflection phase measurements.12 Mourant10 reported on a source–detector separation
that does not depend on scattering properties at the range close to
the light source. Mourant presented a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation
and phantom experiments of reflected light from a semi-infinite medium.
Moreover, Calabro showed the influence of the phase function on generalized
diffuse reflectance models13 from a semi-infinite
medium and presented a singular distance from the source, below the
diffusion regime, which is insensitive to the phase function. Savo
et al.14 recently presented a research
that supports our work. They reported that the light mean path length
is invariant with respect to the microstructure of the medium. The
work was based on the random walk theory, MC simulations, and measurements
of scattered light from glass tubes with scattering solutions using
an autocorrelator for extracting the mean path length.

We believe
that this natural phenomenon of a point, which is indifferent
to changes in the scattering property, depends solely on the tissue
geometry. Knowledge of the position of this point in each geometry
will allow an accurate, self-calibrated detection of absorption-dependent
physiological parameters. Note that this phenomenon only occurs when
multiple scattering exists.6

We show
this phenomenon from a semi-infinite medium theoretically,
by simulations, and experimentally. Diffusion theory is supported
by MC simulation results as well as the experimental results with
phantoms. We consider two geometries, a cylindrical model and a semi-infinite
model, and present a point that is not dependent on the scattering
coefficient. Both geometries are validated by in vivo measurements,
a human finger for the cylindrical model and a mouse neck for the
semi-infinite model.

The finding of the IPL point can be useful
for oxygen saturation
determination, NIR spectroscopy, photoplethysmography (PPG) measurements,
and a wide range of optical sensing methods for physiological aims
in a more accurate way. The FSP utilizes the entire distribution profile
rather than just parts of it by the complete characterization of the
material and its geometry, thereby improving the existing systems
and creating new methods.

2 Diffusion Theory Simulation
The propagation of light through a tissue is mostly described by
the radiative transport equation (RTE). RTE is an approximation to
Maxwell’s equations, based on the conservation of energy, describing
the propagation of energy 1  The radiation
(L(r, ŝ, t)) transported
by photons in direction ŝ and to a distance r from the source at time t is represented
by eq 1, where c is the speed of light. The extinction coefficient is μt = μa + μs′, where μs′ is the reduced scattering
coefficient defined by μs′ = (1 – g)μs for anisotropy factor g and scattering coefficient
μs. P(ŝ′, ŝ) is the phase function, which gives the probability
for a photon traveling in direction ŝ to be
scattered in direction ŝ′. Ω
is a solid angle, and S(r, ŝ, t) represents the radiant source
in the tissue.

The radiation integrated over all directions
is defined by the
fluence rate [W/cm2]15 2  The most typical
approach for solving the
RTE analytically is the diffusion approximation.16,17 Using the solution of diffusion theory at steady state, we can get
the expression for fluence ψ(r)[J/cm2] in response to power Q located at r = 0 as follows 3  Equation 3 describes the steady-state diffusion of light from a point
source of power P, where r is the
position on the XY plane, D is the
diffusion length, D = 1/(3(μa +
μs′)), and δ is the optical penetration depth, . We determine Q to be
1 to examine the light transport independent of the source’s
power.

Because we are interested in developing light diffusion
equations
on the surface of a cylindrical tissue, we express the fluence on
the edge of a circle and obtain the FSP at a cross section, with radius a, of the illuminated cylinder. We can define distance r of a point on the circumference from the light source
(Figure 1) by the law
of cosines as follows 4  On the basis of eqs 3 and 4, the steady-state
diffusion of light on the surface of the cylinder is obtained. This
fluence in accordance with μs′ for each θ at the circle surface
is represented by the following equation 5  The change of the fluence per θ can
predict θIPL, where . 6  For the relevant
μs′ range, the fluence depends
much more on the cylindrical radius a than on μs′ (Figure 2). Because we assume
an angular accuracy of 5°, all of the μs′ yield an identical angle.

cross section.

on the θIPL value (less than 5°) than the radius a.

3 Results
3.1 Full Scattering Profile of a Cylindrical Medium:
Theory, Simulation, and Experiment Results
The FSPs of a
cylindrical medium based on diffusion theory are presented in Figure 3. The reduced scattering
coefficients are in the human skin range of 15−30 cm−1 and the radius 1 cm. The IPL point appears at 127°.

Figure 3 FSPs and the
IPL point of cylindrical tissues according to diffusion
theory (logarithmic scale).

The location of the IPL point on the surface of a cylinder
is dependent
on its radius. As the radius increases, the fixed-intensity point
becomes closer to the light source. Because diffusion theory is relevant
for distances larger than one or two transport mean free path (MFP’)
from the light source,15 where MFP′
= 1/(μa +μs′). The radii smaller than the MFP’
are not valid for this theory, and similar is the case with the large
radii where the IPL point appears at high angles because diffusion
theory is inaccurate near the source. At the relevant range of radii,
which describes fingers and cylindrical tissues that the light can
penetrate through, the IPL point depends on the tissue radius.

Using our MC simulation, which is appropriate for the regions close
to the source, we described the FSPs of cylindrical tissues with different
reduced scattering coefficients of 14 to 26 cm–1 for 6.5 mm tissue radius, as shown in Figure 4a, and simulated these FSPs for various tissue
diameters. The IPL point appeared in each set of tissues. Moreover,
a linear dependency on tissue radius was determined, as shown in Figure 4b.

Figure 4 (a) FSPs and the IPL
point from the MC simulation of a cylindrical
finger tissue, 6.5mm radius. (b) Linear dependency of IPL point on
the radius.

We built a unique setup
(Figure 5) for noninvasive
encircled measurements containing
a continuous wave source and a portable photodetector (PD).

Figure 5 Illustration
of the setup for measuring FSP using a portable photodetector
(PD).

Our experiment reveals an IPL
point, in accordance with the simulation,
that is independent of the optical properties. We used one continuous
wave laser, a photodetector, and tissue-mimicking phantoms presenting
different optical properties. The FSP and the IPL point that appeared
at 115° are shown in Figure 6a. The linear dependence of the IPL point location
on the radius of the cylindrical phantom is presented in Figure 6b.

FSPs of phantoms, with 0.6 cm radius and (b) linear dependency of
IPL point on the radius.

We measured a human finger in vivo in our system to validate
the
FSP behavior of cylindrical tissues. We used two wavelengths and obtained
the FSPs of a human finger, which are presented in Figure 7. The effective radius of the
finger is 0.6 cm, and the common point for these FSPs appears at 110°,
whereas in the phantom results, at a similar effective radius, the
IPL point is obtained at 115°. The human finger contains blood
vessels, which add a non-negligible absorption. The absorption has
a spectral dependence; therefore, the measurements are decreased for
each wavelength separately and the common point is different from
the phantoms’ IPL point.

and 780 nm (squares).

3.2 Reflection from a Semi-Infinite Medium: Theory,
Simulation, and Experiment Results
On the basis of diffusion
theory, we calculated the reflected light intensity from a semi-infinite
medium at distance r from the source. The reflection
intensity from a semi-infinite medium with different reduced scattering
coefficients, in the range of 15–30 cm–1,
is shown in Figure 8a. A crossing point appears at 8 mm from the source. This location
can also be called the IPL distance, rIPL, from the illumination point.

Figure 8 Reflection from a semi-infinite tissue:
(a) reflection according
to diffusion theory; a crossing point does not depend on scattering
properties (blue crosses, orange squares, yellow diamonds, and purple
circles represent μs′ at 15, 20, 25, and 30 cm–1, respectively). (b) MC simulation of a crossing point, which is
indifferent to changes in the scattering property (orange solid, yellow
dash-dotted, magenta dotted, and green dashed lines represent μs′ at 8, 10,
12, and 14 cm–1, respectively).

In addition, a MC simulation for various reduced scattering
coefficients,
in the range of 8–14 cm–1, suggested that
path lengths do not depend on the scattering properties of the medium
at a distance of rIPL = 3.5 mm from the
source, as presented in Figure 8b. These values represent the optical tissue coefficients,
as we used in the experimental system.

We conducted an experiment
on DR measurements from a solid silicon-based
phantom without absorption components.18,19 An illustration
of the measurement system is shown in Figure 9.

Figure 9 Illustration of a setup for DR measurement from
a semi-infinite
tissue with a PD.

By measuring two wavelengths,
we found a common point at a specific
distance from the light source, as presented in Figure 10a. The common light intensity
for two different wavelengths clearly represents the area that does
not depend on the scattering properties.

Figure 10 (a) DR measurements
of phantom using two wavelengths; a crossing
point appears at 5.1 mm (crosses for 650 nm and squares for 780 nm).
(b) In vivo DR measurements of mouse (in inset) using two wavelengths;
a crossing point appears at 3.4 mm (crosses for 650 nm and squares
for 780 nm).

In addition, we measured
a semi-infinite medium in vivo. The light
intensity as a function of distance from the light source, which was
reflected from the carotid artery of mice, is presented in Figure 10b. The common light
intensity point for the mice appears closer to the light source than
that in the control phantom. This is expected because the absorption
through tissues is higher in the red range than that in the NIR range.20 Hence, the phantom measurements reveal the IPL
point where scattering changes have a minimal impact without absorption
components. By detecting this location, we can achieve accurate extraction
of absorption coefficients from in vivo measurements, whereas the
measurement at the right point excludes the scattering.

4 Discussion
We claim that the finding of an
IPL point in cylindrical (Figure 11a) and semi-infinite (Figure 11b) tissues is actually the same phenomenon.
Both cases are geometric positions that depend on the distance from
the light source where the optical path length is not affected by
the optical parameters.

Figure 11 Schemas of (a) an irradiated cylindrical tissue
cross section and
the location of θIPL, (b) an irradiated semi-infinite
tissue and the location of rIPL, (c) both
geometries on the same coordinate system, (d) comparison between theoretical
and experimental results; the relation between θIPL and tissue radius a is calculated by intersection
with rIPL (curve) and experimental results
of human fingers (dots).

The relation between the angle of an IPL point in a cylindrical
medium, θIPL, and the radius a will
be obtained merely by geometrical computations. Let us consider both
geometries on the same coordinate system (Figure 11c).

In the semi-infinite geometry,
the IPL distance, rIPL, from the illumination
point inside the medium defines
the following circle equation (blue-dashed line in Figure 11b) 7  In the cylindrical
geometry, the tissue cross
section is placed adjacent to the light source (black circle in Figure 11a); hence, the
surface is defined by 8  We calculated the intersection between eqs 7 and 8 and
expressed it in terms of the IPL angle, θIPL, using
the Taylor approximation for arccosine 9  In Figure 11d, the black line
represents this equation for rIPL = 6.4
mm and the relevant range of a. This relation is
compared with the experimental results
of human fingers where θIPL was measured by a single
wavelength by comparing two perpendicular orientations (dots in Figure 11d from ref (22)). The relation from eq 9 shows a high fit to these
experimental results. Hence, the intersection found in eq 9 reveals the θIPL angle in which the IPL point is located according to the finger
diameter.

Note that the rIPL that
presented high
correlation to the in vivo results from ref (22) is a value similar to rIPL = 6.8 mm from diffusion theory. Hence, we
can determine that the IPL points, which are not influenced by the
scattering properties of the medium in the two mentioned geometries,
are converged to the same distance from the light source (Supporting
Information, Video file).

5 Conclusions
The optical measurements of tissues are influenced
by the absorption
as well as scattering. Therefore, there is a challenge to extract
an accurate physiological parameter from the absorption regardless
of the additional optical parameters’ effect.

By using
the FSP method, we show the effect of optical properties
on the FSP and the IPL point that is not influenced by the reduced
scattering coefficient in a cylindrical medium. We present in this
article the existence of the IPL phenomenon in theory, simulations,
and experimental results using tissuelike phantoms and finally in
vivo measurements.

In oxygen tissue assessment, the transmitted
light is described
by the modified Beer–Lambert law,21I = I0 e–(μa(λ)l(λ)+G), where l is the optical path length
that depends on the absorption and scattering coefficients and G is a geometric factor. When measuring at several wavelengths, l changes. The existing methods suffer from an inherent
error due to these differences in the optical path length, which must
be calibrated externally via in vitro measurements. The calibration
process adds an error that is too high for some clinical problems;23,24 therefore, it is challenging to extract the needed parameter (e.g.,
SpO2) correctly.25

The
IPL point overcomes this problem because the different sources
undergo the same optical path length even though they experience different
reduced scattering coefficients.

Moreover, this phenomenon of
a geometric location, where the intensity
is independent of the reduced scattering coefficients, appears in
a semi-infinite medium as well. We demonstrated that this phenomenon
occurs through diffusion theory, MC simulation, and experiments using
phantoms as well as in vivo measurements in the DR system. There are
researchers who examined the light scattering on the basis of diffusion
theory and an equivalent isotropic source and an extrapolated boundary,17 and their solution agrees with ours.

In
addition, a similar geometric phenomenon was reported by others13 about a distance from the light source that
is neutralized by the effect of the phase function. This optical parameter
has an influence on calculations of the reflected intensity beside
a specific location. This location can also be called an IPL point
where reflectance is not dependent on the phase function.

The
correct choice of a measurement point allows the neutralization
of the scattering effect and as a result enables us to measure other
optical parameters accurately. The use of this unique behavior can
predict more accurate measurements in the biomedical field. The measurement
of the light intensity at the IPL point, which is independent of the
tissue scattering, can improve accuracy in two ways: as a self-calibration
point for another measurement point on the FSP in a single wavelength
or by measuring the absorption at the IPL point that neutralizes the
scattering at two wavelengths.

6 Computational Methods and
Experimental Section
6.1 Monte Carlo Simulation
The most common
model of simulating light–tissue interactions is the MC simulation.
MC simulations are recommended for regions close to the source. We
investigated the dependency of the IPL point in the case of different
tissue diameters. As we explained in our previous work,26 we simulated a beam of photons that enters the
circular cross section of tissue parallel to the z direction. The propagation path of each photon is calculated from
the scattering constant, assuming that the absorption is negligible.
The values of the reduced scattering coefficients (μs′) were in the range of the human skin values.6 In addition, we used a MC simulation from a semi-infinite
medium that Prof. Jacques shared with us to deepen and enrich the
research.

We simulated the FSP of a circular cross section of
a tissue via MC method with relevant assumptions and changes. We chose
several reduced scattering coefficients and different tissue diameters.
This simulation is based on the assumption that all photons reaching
the tissue begin as ballistic photons. At each step (dr) of the photon, the new direction (θnew) was calculated
using the current photon’s direction (θold) and the probability a photon would scatter, 1 – exp(−μs′dr). In the case of a scattering event, its new direction
was calculated using θnew = θold + s × cos–1 g, where s is a random number from the group [−1,
1]. The location of
a photon that arrived to the boundary of the cylindrical tissue was
saved as the exit angle.

6.2 Experiments
6.2.1 FSP Setup
The setup includes a
continuous wave illumination using a He–Ne gas laser (Thorlabs,
Newton, SA) with a wavelength of λ = 632.8 nm, a maximum power
of 8 mW, and a laser beam waist of ω0 = 0.63 mm.
In addition, for in vivo measurement, a pigtailed NIR laser (Oxxius
S.A., France) was used with λ = 785 nm. We use a portable fixed
gain silicon detector as a PD. The PD has an active area of 0.8 mm2, and it is placed on a rotation stage to enable the full
scattering profile measurements. The stage can be rotated around a
tube with an accuracy of 1°. The voltage is measured every 5°,
where 0° is the full transmission and 180° is the full reflection.

6.2.2 Phantoms
Cylindrical tissuelike
phantoms were prepared on the basis of intra-lipid (IL) in various
concentrations to measure the influence of the reduced scattering
coefficient on the FSP experimentally. The IL concentration is calculated
according to the reduced scattering coefficients for each phantom,13 in the range of the human skin values of 8–26
cm–1, similar to that in the MC simulation. The
liquid phantoms were placed in test tubes with different diameters.
They were measured from 0 to 145°, whereas the remaining angles
were not measurable because of the blocking of the light source by
the detector.

6.2.3 DR Measurements System
The diffusion
reflectance (DR) method is a simple and safe technology for extracting
optical parameters using the light intensity at different distances
ρ (light source–detector separation). The DR system (NEGOH-OP
Technologies, Israel), as was previously described by us,27 contains two sources, 650 and 780 nm using an
optic fiber with a diameter of 125 μm. A portable photodiode
was deposited at different distances (ρ) from the source on
the sample surface in a micrometer scale. The photodiode had a cross-section
diameter of 1 mm2, the reflected intensity was measured.

The in vivo measurements using the DR system were carried out on
a C57BL male mouse (aged 4.5 months). The mouse was anesthetized by
injecting intraperitoneally 200 μL of a mixture of ketamine
(10 mg/mL) and xylazine (2 mg/mL). The hair on the neck facing the
laser was removed before the measurements.

This study received
institutional approval from the Bar Ilan Institute
for Nanotechnology and Advanced Materials Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee. All in vivo measurements were performed under appropriate
anesthesia: the mice barrier-controlled facility followed the guidelines
of Bar Ilan’s Institute for Nanotechnology and Advanced Materials
Animal Care and Use Committee. The mice were inspected daily by the
veterinarian, who handled the appropriate tests and treatment protocols
as required. All research protocols were followed strictly by the
veterinarian. All major procedures were performed in the surgical
facilities using general anesthesia and standard aseptic surgical
techniques.
