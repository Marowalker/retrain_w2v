A systematic study
has been carried out to develop a material with significant protection
properties
from galactic cosmic radiation and solar energetic particles. The
research focused on the development of hydrogen-rich benzoxazines,
which are particularly effective for shielding against such radiation.
Newly developed benzoxazine resin can be polymerized at 120 °C,
which meets the low-temperature processing requirements for use with
ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fiber, a hydrogen-rich
composite reinforcement. This highly reactive benzoxazine resin also
exhibits low viscosity and good shelf-life. The structure of the benzoxazine
monomer is confirmed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy. Polymerization behavior and thermal
properties are evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry and
thermogravimetric analysis. Dynamic mechanical analysis is used to
study chemorheological properties of the benzoxazine monomer, rheological
properties of the cross-linked polybenzoxazine, and rheological properties
of UHMWPE-reinforced polybenzoxazine composites. The theoretical radiation
shielding capability of the composite is also evaluated using computer-based
simulations.

1 Introduction
In recent years, benzoxazines
have generated great interest given
their capacity to polymerize and generate polybenzoxazines (PBZs).
Polybenzoxazines are thermosets with unique and exciting attributes,
such as low flammability,1 near-zero shrinkage,2 high thermal stability,3 and excellent mechanical properties.3d,4 However, one
of the most important features of benzoxazines is their versatile
molecular design capability,5 which makes
it possible to tailor the properties at the molecular level to obtain
targeted characteristics that are particularly advantageous for specific
applications.

The development of new materials to effectively
protect astronauts
from harmful radiation has been an important issue since the beginning
of space travel. The wide variety of radiation encountered in space
includes galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) and solar energetic particles
(SEPs). Aluminum is widely used for spacecraft construction, especially
structural components. However, aluminum does not shield effectively
against GCR and SEP. This necessitates the addition of other shielding
materials into the spacecraft design, resulting in a heavier and larger
craft. A variety of other materials have been studied, including hydrogenated
graphite nanofibers, lithium hydride, polysulfone, polyetherimide,
liquid methane, carbon fiber composites, epoxy, and polyethylene (PE).6 Recent studies have incorporated nanosized particles
made of metal, metal oxides, and coated polymers into high-strength
polymer matrices.6b,7 Much of the attention on radiation
shielding has shifted to polymer composites because of the potential
for high protection efficiency and high specific properties, such
as specific strength and specific modulus.8 Hydrogen-rich materials are known to be effective for shielding
against GCR and SEP; thus, composites with a hydrogen-rich matrix
and ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fiber reinforcement
can provide both shielding and structural utility. A recent patent
by Kaul et al. describes a three-layered composite that can be used
for space vehicles or space habitat structures. The outer layer is
an epoxy composite reinforced with UHMWPE and graphite fibers. This
layer is intended to provide protection against micrometeoroid impacts.
The sandwiched layer, an UHWMPE fiber-reinforced PE composite, is
primarily constructed for radiation protection. As an integral structural
member, the innermost layer is made of ceramic tiles.9 Polyethylene (CH2)n is a relatively inexpensive polymer that possesses a high concentration
of hydrogen atoms within its molecular structure.10 In-flight studies were also undertaken to confirm its efficiency.11 PE slabs have been used to improve shielding
in some quarters of the Intcon (ISS).12 However, PE slabs provide little or no structural utility.

The most significant challenge encountered during this project
was related to resin development. The newly developed resins reported
in this publication were required to possess the following characteristics:
(i) the resin must have high hydrogen concentration approaching that
of polyethylene; (ii) the resin can polymerize and cross-link at 120
°C via oxazine ring-opening reaction in a reasonable processing
time; and (iii) the resin must have adequate shelf-life for commercial
viability. The seemingly contradictory requirements of (ii) and (iii)
are important from the manufacturing point of view, whereas the requirement
(i) is needed for the material to successfully protect astronauts
from GCR and SEP.

The current paper is the result of more than
a decade of developmental
efforts. In the early stages of development, we successfully developed
high hydrogen-containing benzoxazine resins that can be polymerized
at 120 °C. Compounds shown in Table 1 satisfied the hydrogen concentration requirement.
However, these resins polymerized only through the condensation reaction
of the terminal groups of the polybenzoxazine main chain. Thus, this
led to mostly oligomeric, linear polybenzoxazines that did not fulfill
the requirement of polymerization via oxazine ring opening.

Table 1 Initial Benzoxazine Compounds Studied
Further attempts to develop a long-chain
alkyl group bearing ortho-functional
bisphenol as a raw material allowed an increase in the hydrogen concentration
and a reduction in the polymerization temperature. Recently, reactivity
and properties of isomeric benzoxazines have been reported13 where bisphenols based on the substituent ortho
to the phenolic group have unexpectedly shown superior properties
to those of the para position. Use of the ortho position also improved
reactivity while maintaining a high concentration of hydrogen. However,
both reactivity and shelf-life were inadequate, and the processability
requirement was not met.

It has been a long and sustaining effort
in the benzoxazine chemistry
community to understand the mechanism of increased rate of polymerization
and develop compounds that polymerize at low temperature with good
shelf-life. Understanding the polymerization mechanism of benzoxazines
is an elusive target despite significant efforts by many researchers.14

Adding a rigid moiety in the backbone
seems to accelerate the rate
of polymerization. This phenomenon was reported for a liquid crystal
forming monomer15 as well as a diacetylene-bearing
molecule.16 Near neighbor effect is also
reported to be effective in reducing the polymerization temperature.3a,17 Another approach is to form intramolecular five- or six-membered
hydrogen bonding to the oxazine ring, which significantly influences
the ring-opening equilibrium.18 Naturally,
adding initiators and/or catalyst will help reduce the temperature
as well.14e,19 One popular approach is to understand the
role of the substituent, either on the phenolic or amine moiety, in
influencing the oxazine ring-opening equilibrium. Influence of the
substituents on the oxazine reactivity has been a popular subject.17c,17d,20 Yet, to date, no benzoxazine
monomers have been reported that possess the characteristics of a
low polymerization temperature of 120 °C and a sufficient shelf-life.

It was, therefore, the purpose of this work to develop an approach
to synthesize benzoxazine resins that can be polymerized at 120 °C,
provide a shelf-life of several months (when stored under refrigerated
conditions), and possess a high hydrogen concentration that is sufficient
to protect astronauts from GCR and SEP. In this study, a series of
bifunctional benzoxazines were synthesized from meta-substituted alkoxy
phenols, particularly methoxy and butoxyphenol, and diamines with
different hydrocarbon chain lengths. The structures of the synthesized
monomers were analyzed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy.
The trend in polymerization temperature and thermal stability was
studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA). Due to small structural variations in the isomers,
it was not possible to separate and purify the isomers independently.

of formalin was used. Chloroform (5 mL/g of reactants) was added to
the flask. The reaction mixture was refluxed with stirring at room
temperature for 4 h. The crude reaction products were washed three
times with 1 N NaOH solution and rinsed three times with distilled
water. The products were dried over magnesium sulfate anhydrous overnight
and filtered to remove the salt. The products were then precipitated
by rinsing with hexane. The purified benzoxazine monomer was dried

2.5 Cross-Linking
of Benzoxazines
All
benzoxazine resins were cross-linked using a heating schedule that
included a dwell at 120 °C for at least 2 h. Since the resins
described in the current paper are intended for use as matrices in
composites with UHMWPE fiber reinforcements (whose properties start
degrading at 130 °C in several hours), polymerization conditions
were selected so as to not degrade the properties of the reinforcing
fibers.

2.6 Preparation of UHMWPE Fiber-Reinforced Polybenzoxazine
Composites
Composite samples, containing UHMWPE fiber reinforcements
and poly(3BOP-daC12) matrices, were fabricated using a vacuum bagging
process. A flat mold, constructed from a 30.5 × 30.5 × 0.953
cm3 (12 × 12 × 0.375 in.3)-polished
aluminum plate, was used as the primary fabrication tool. An exploded
assembly drawing of the mold is shown below in Figure 1. Composites were prepared by the hand lay-up
method followed by vacuum bagging operation for polymerization and
consolidation. Benzoxazine resin was spread onto UHMWPE fabric plies
using a spatula and plastic squeegee. A large ceramic hotplate was
placed under the aluminum mold and used as the heat source.

Figure 1 Exploded assembly
drawing of the vacuum bagging mold.

Consolidation and polymerization of all composites were achieved
by simultaneously applying vacuum and heating the surface of the mold.
The surface temperature of the aluminum mold was monitored and recorded
throughout the polymerization cycle using surface-mounted thermocouples.
A Welch ChemStar 1400N vacuum pump was used to apply vacuum to the
mold. The pump was connected to the mold using vacuum tubing and a
through-bag vacuum connector located on the top surface of the breather
layer. A photograph of the equipment setup is provided below in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Photograph of composite
fabrication equipment. (Photo is a courtesy
of S. Winroth.)

A plot of a typical composite
polymerization cycle is provided
below in Figure 3.
An initial ramp and hold at 80 °C was performed to remove any
excess moisture from the resin prior to polymerization. The resin
was then polymerized at 120 °C for at least 2 h. The composite
was under full vacuum (approx. 98 kPa or 29 in. Hg) during the entire
polymerization cycle.

Figure 3 Plot of typical composite polymerization cycle.

After completion of the polymerization
cycle, the entire aluminum
mold was removed from the hotplate, placed on a cooling rack, and
allowed to cool to room temperature. Vacuum continued to be applied
during cooling to prevent warping of the composite plate. Thermocouple
temperature was also monitored during cooling, and the composite was
allowed to cool to approximately 60 °C prior to removal from
the mold. Composite plates were visually inspected for defects after
being removed from the mold. Excess resin flash and vacuum sealing
tape were removed from the edges of the composite plates using a razor
blade.

Composite samples were fabricated for mechanical testing.
Two composites
samples, each having nominal dimensions of 254 mm × 254 mm ×
1.5 mm, were fabricated to generate specimens for tensile testing.
Each composite was reinforced with eight plies of plain-woven Spectra
1000 fabric (Style 932), which had a nominal ply thickness of approximately
0.19 mm.

The appearance of the composite surfaces, including
the as-molded
surface and surfaces resulting from laser cutting and waterjet cutting,
was similar to that of other composites manufactured commercially
for structural applications. Composite samples were cross-sectioned
using a waterjet cutter and then wet-polished with successively finer
grades of silicon carbide sandpaper, down to 600 grit. The cross-sections
were examined using stereomicroscopy. Examination revealed excellent
infiltration of the resin into the reinforcing fibers and consolidation
of the composites.

A fiber volume fraction (Vf) of approximately
60% was targeted for all composites. The volume fraction of fiber
in each composite sample was calculated from empirical data as a quality
control measure. This ensured that all composites contained the proper
amounts of fiber and resin. The volume of fiber in each composite
sample was determined by dividing the mass of UHMWPE fabric in the
sample (weighed prior to lay-up) by the density of UHMWPE fabric (0.97
g/cm3). Total composite volume was calculated using dimensional
measurements that were taken for each sample after processing was
completed. Average fiber volume fraction was calculated as 59.2 ±
3.0% for tensile testing composites.

2.7 Equipment
and Characterization
Molecular
structures were studied using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra obtained on Varian Oxford AS600 with a proton
frequency of 600 MHz. The solvent and internal standard used were
deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) and tetramethylsilane, respectively.
For integrated intensity measurements, the relaxation time was set
at 10 s with an average of 16 transients.

For further structural
analysis, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic analysis
was also performed using a Bomem Michelson MB 110 spectrophotometer
with deuterated triglycine sulfate detector. A small amount of sample
was sandwiched between two KBr plates. For each sample, 32 scans were
accumulated and averaged at a resolution of 4 cm–1 to obtain the final FT-IR absorption spectrum.

Thermally induced
transitional behavior of the benzoxazines was
studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) on a TA Instruments
Modulated DSC model 2920 at a heating ramp rate of 10 °C/min
with a nitrogen gas purge rate of 60 mL/min. Approximately 1 mg of
sample was pressed in a hermetic aluminum pan with lid. Thermal stability
of the cross-linked benzoxazines was studied using thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) on a TA Instruments model High-Res TGA 2950 at a heating
ramp rate of 10 °C/min with a nitrogen gas purge rate of 60 mL/min.

Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was used to determine rheological
data using a Rheometrics RMS-800 in a torsional mode with the sample
size of the composite being 6 mm × 60 mm × 1 mm. The frequency
of the torsional motion was 1 Hz with a temperature ramp rate of 2
°C/min. A strain sweep was first performed to determine the largest
possible strain to judge the linear viscoelastic limit and optimize
the sensitivity and reproducibility.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Structural and Property
Characterization of
Benzoxazine Monomers
The synthesis of the benzoxazines was
done following the scheme shown in Figure 4 where the numbers in the parenthesis indicates
the position of the alkoxy group with respect to the oxygen atom.

Figure 4 General
synthesis scheme showing the mixture of three possible
isomers.

3.1.1 1H NMR Analysis
NMR
spectroscopy was used to
confirm the structures of the linear aliphatic diamine-based benzoxazine
monomers. The spectra in Figure 5 show characteristic resonances of the oxazine ring
centered at approximately 3.94 and 4.84 ppm, which are attributed
to O–CH2–N and Ar–CH2–N,
respectively.8 The original substitution
of the alkoxy group in the phenol affects the symmetry of the molecule,
resulting in three possible regioisomers: 5,5′; 7,7′;
5,7′. The presence of a mixture of isomers in the product is
confirmed by the resonances in the aromatic region. Integration and J coupling analysis show that substitution at the 7-position
is favored over substitution at the 5-position in a 3:1 ratio. It
should be mentioned that NMR analysis does not allow one to distinguish
the 5,7′ isomer from those of 5,5′ or 7,7′ as
the resonances in 5,7′ completely overlap with those of 5,5′
or 7,7′ positions. This favorable 7-position placement is likely
due to the −OR group being on the 5-position. With increasing
chain length, trends in the NMR spectra are observed. For example,
the signals from the alkyl protons become broader and more complex.
Furthermore, the double doublet that is observed around 6.3 ppm becomes
less symmetric with increasing chain length. The triplet directly
downstream of this signal shifts upstream as the alkyl chain length
increases such that in 3MOP-daC8 the triplet begins to merge with
the double doublet.

3.1.2 Infrared Analysis
The FT-IR spectra
for all of the diamine-based benzoxazines show great similarity, except
for the expected intensity differences in the aliphatic CH2 group-related bands. In Figure 6, for all cases, the band around 966 cm–1 confirms the presence of the characteristic N–CH2–O benzoxazine bonds.20l The bands
around 1030 and 1156 cm–1 represent the presence
of the aromatic ether of the benzene ring. These three peaks begin
to decrease during polymerization as the oxazine ring opens. The band
around 1377 cm–1 represents the wagging of the hydrogen
atoms in the fourth position, and this band also decreases with polymerization
because of the opening of the oxazine ring. The bands around 1500
and 1620 cm–1 are characteristic modes of a trisubstituted
benzene ring. These bands decrease during polymerization as the ring
becomes tetrasubstituted, confirming successful polymerization. The
broad bands between 2730 and 3030 cm–1 are consistent
with the C–H stretches in the alkyl chain, the methoxy or butoxy
substituent, and the aromatic benzoxazine ring.14a−14d

to the monomers and the dashed lines correspond to the material polymerized
for 2 h at 120 °C.

3.1.3 Shelf-Life
A total of approximately
2.5 kg of 3BOP-daC12 monomer was prepared in eight batches during
the project and stored in a freezer until needed for sample fabrication.
For composite fabrication, the monomer was removed from the freezer
and remained at room temperature for 4–6 h during thawing,
handling, and preparation of the composite. The monomer was then returned
to the freezer. Some samples were stored for longer than 3 months
and experienced as many as 12 freeze/thaw cycles. The length of storage
and repeated thawing and refreezing of the resin had no noticeable
effects on viscosity, rheology, or processability.

3.1.4 Polymerization Behavior
The effects
of the phenol substitution and the diamine chain length on the polymerization
behavior were studied using DSC. Thermograms are shown below in Figure 7. The DSC polymerization
exotherms for the diamine-based series of benzoxazine monomers reveal
that these compounds have several overlapping peaks, indicating separate
processes are contributing to the overall polymerization exotherm.
Also, given that each sample is a mixture of isomers widening of the
exothermic peak was expected. This can be seen in the thermogram below
and has also been reported in the literature.13b The extremely low exotherm exhibited by 3MOP-daC2 has been
previously attributed to the short ethane chain, which increases the
steric hindrance of the molecule: destabilizing the oxazine rings
and lowering the polymerization temperature.20m,21

To help support the experimental results, 5-butoxy-3-butyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-benzo[e][1,3]oxazine (abbreviated as
PH-bb) and 3-butyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-benzo[e][1,3]oxazine (abbreviated as PH-b) were chosen as model compounds
using a Gaussian simulation to determine the collective natural charge
of the phenol ring and the oxygen in the oxazine ring of the compound.
Although the benzoxazine actually used for composite manufacturing
was a bisoxazine, a mono-oxazine system, PH-bb, was chosen as the
model system to simplify the calculation. The molecular structures
for PH-b and PH-bb are shown in Figure 8. This simulation showed that PH-bb’s natural
charge (−0.0929 eV) is 0.0396 less than the natural charge
of PH-b (−0.0907 eV), so that the difference in natural charge
between the two compounds is 0.0022 eV.

Figure 8 Molecular structure of
benzoxazine resins used for Gaussian simulation.

A similar study was done on 3-phenyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-benzo[e][1,3]oxazine (abbreviated as
PH-a) where
different para substituted PH-a molecules were simulated using the
Gaussian program.22 The relationship between
the two compounds is nonlinear so an exact comparison between PH-b
and PH-a is difficult; however, qualitative results can be obtained.

Using PH-a as reference, the largest difference in natural charge
is 0.0088 eV, which results from a meta-substituted nitro group on
the phenol ring. This nitro-substituted group has a polymerization
temperature of 209 °C, which is 61 °C less than the polymerization
temperature of PH-a. The difference in natural charge between PH-b
and 2BTPH-b (−0.0022 eV) is a quarter of the largest difference
obtained for PH-a (0.0088 eV). As mentioned before, it is difficult
to predict the exact difference in polymerization temperature from
the PH-a study, but because the natural charge decreases from PH-b
and 2BTPH-b, a decrease in polymerization temperature from PH-b to
2BTPH-b is expected.

3.2 Properties of Polybenzoxazines
and UHMWPE
Fiber-Reinforced Polybenzoxazines
3.2.1 Thermal
Stability
TGA was used
to study the thermal stability of polymers derived from the meta-substituted
benzoxazines. Samples were polymerized for 2 h at 120 °C. TGA
thermograms and derivative weight loss thermograms are shown in Figure 9. Degradation temperature
and char yield results are summarized in Table 2. Literature values for UHMWPE are included
in Table 2 for reference.23 Degradation temperature was evaluated by determining
the temperature at which 5% weight loss (Td5) and 10% weight loss (Td10) occurred.
The char yield was also determined for each sample. Char yield is
defined as the percent residual weight at 800 °C under nitrogen
atmosphere. A trend of decreasing char yield for samples with longer
alkyl chains was observed. This trend was attributed to the fact that
benzoxazines with longer alkyl chains have lower concentrations of
aromatics in the molecule. However, the high molecular weight and
presence of rigid aromatic structures appear to be sufficient to enhance
the thermal stability to an extent greater than that of UHMWPE. A
comparison between poly(3MOP-daC12) and poly(3BOP-daC12) shows a small
improvement in the thermal stability of the latter.

 	Td5 (°C)	Td10 (°C)	char yield

poly(3MOP-daC4)	269	299	37.4	
poly(3MOP-daC6)	281	304	34.1	
poly(3MOP-daC8)	286	314	23.9	
poly(3MOP-daC12)	281	307	15.9	
poly(3BOP-daC12)	272	310	16.5	
UHMWPE	431	466	0.11	
From the
derivative weight loss curves as well as the Td5 temperature, it is apparent that diamine chain length
has some influence on the onset temperature of thermal degradation.
From the data presented, it appears that with the exception of poly(3MOP-daC12)
and poly(3BOP-daC12), thermal stability slightly increases with increased
diamine chain length, whereas the char yield significantly decreases.
In the case of poly(3BOP-daC12), the onset of degradation is even
lower due to the presence of the longer butyl chain compared to the
methyl group. Despite a significant decrease in char yield compared
to typical polybenzoxazines, the observed char yields are remarkably
higher than usual aliphatic compounds, which typically exhibit near-zero
char yields.

3.2.2 Dynamic Mechanical Properties
Dynamic
mechanical analysis (DMA) was performed to study the change in viscoelastic
properties resulting from substitutions of the phenol. Three polybenzoxazine
samples, poly(PH-daC12), poly(3MOP-daC12), and poly(3BOP-daC12), were
prepared from 1,12-diaminododecane and three different phenols (an
unsubstituted phenol, a meta-methoxyphenol, and a meta-butoxyphenol). A composite was also formed using poly(3BOP-daC12)
and UHMWPE fabric. The results from this experiment are shown in Figure 10, and the glass
transition temperatures (Tg) observed
for each polybenzoxazine are listed in Table 3.

Figure 10 DMA spectra of polybenzoxazines derived from
PH-daC12, 3BOP-daC12,
3MOP-daC12, and the UHMWPE fiber/poly(3BOP-daC12) composite.

Table 3 Glass Transition

poly(3BOP-daC12)	64	
poly(3MOP-daC12)	106	
poly(3BOP-daC12) composite	76	
The broad tan δ peaks that were observed
suggest that
the polymers experience glass transitions over a wide temperature
range. This may be attributed to slight structural variations caused
by the isomer mixture. Poly(3MOP-daC12) exhibited a longer glassy
region and a shorter rubbery region than poly(3BOP-daC12). In both
the meta-methoxy- and meta-butoxy-substituted
compounds, the loss and storage moduli overlap in the transition region.

3.2.3 1H NMR Study of Polymer Structure
Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR) was
used to further investigate the polymerization mechanism of this family
of benzoxazines. For this study, 3MOP-daC2, 3MOP-daC4, 3MOP-daC6,
and 3MOP-daC8 were polymerized for 2 h at 120 °C, whereas 3MOP-daC12
and 3BOP-daC12 were polymerized for 1 h at 120 °C, making it
possible to dissolve the samples in CDCl3. In a previous
study reported by Liu et al.,14e it was
proposed that the presence of a peak around 4.3 ppm is indicative
of phenolic CH2 units originating from a nitrogen attaching
to the ortho position on the phenol. In Figure 11, it is clear that the characteristic benzoxazine
resonances at 3.90–3.97 and 4.80–4.87 ppm are still
present, which implies that not all oxazine rings have undergone the
ring-opening reaction. For all cases, except 3MOP-daC2, it is also
possible to observe a resonance around 4.34 ppm, which is consistent
with the proposed phenolic structure for the PBZ. This result is consistent
with the DSC observations, which suggest a different mechanistic pathway
for 3MOP-daC2 compared to all of the other benzoxazines in this family
that we studied. Poly(3MOP-daC4) did not sufficiently dissolve in
CDCl3 to obtain a clear spectrum. Figure 12 shows molecular models with other possible
methylene generated by different mechanistic pathways.

°C for 1 h.

3.3 Estimation of Hydrogen Concentration
Polybenzoxazines developed during this project were tailored at the
molecular level to possess high concentrations of hydrogen per unit
volume. A simple formula, based on the number of hydrogen atoms in
the repeat unit, the polymer density, and the molecular weight, was
used to estimate hydrogen concentration in each polybenzoxazine formulation.
To obtain density values, polybenzoxazine samples were polymerized
for 2 h at 120 °C and then weighed in air and while submersed
in water, providing the density by way of Archimedes’ Principle.
The following formula was then used to calculate the hydrogen concentration
in each compound  where NH is the
number of hydrogen atoms per repeat unit of the polymer, NAv is Avogadro’s number (6.022 × 1023 repeat units/mol), ρ is the density of the polymer in g/cm3, and MWrepeat unit is the molar mass of the
repeat unit of the polymer in g/mol. The final units for hydrogen
concentration are expressed as (H atoms/cm3) × 1023.

The densities obtained from the displacement tests
are listed in Table 4 along with other parameters used in the calculation. The calculated
hydrogen concentration for each compound is provided in Table 5.

Hydrogen Concentration in Polybenzoxazines

poly(3MOP-daC6)	32	1.07	412.530	
poly(3MOP-daC8)	36	1.08	440.584	
poly(3MOP-daC12)	44	1.12	496.692	
poly(3BOP-daC12)	56	1.07	580.854	
Table 5 Estimated Hydrogen Concentration in
Alkoxy-diamino-polybenzoxazines
 	hydrogen concentration (H atoms/cm3 × 1023)	
poly(3MOP-daC4)	0.451	
poly(3MOP-daC6)	0.501	
poly(3MOP-daC8)	0.531	
poly(3MOP-daC12)	0.595	
poly(3BOP-daC12)	0.622	
poly(BNP-diC12)	0.673	
poly(BPA-diC12)	0.625	
These results indicate a trend of increasing density
with increasing
alkyl chain length for polybenzoxazines based on methoxyphenol, which
also impacts increase in hydrogen concentration. For poly(3BOP-daC12),
the lower density is compensated by the increase in hydrogen atoms
per repeat unit, which results in an increase in hydrogen concentration
compared to the methoxyphenol-based polybenzoxazines. Compared to
poly(BNP-diC12) and poly(BPA-diC12), polybenzoxazines developed during
the initial stage of this project, hydrogen concentrations in the
methoxyphenol- and butoxyphenol-based polybenzoxazines are slightly
lower. However, it is important to reiterate that the earlier materials
were not viable due to incomplete polymerization and short shelf-life.

3.4 Simulated Shielding Performance for Poly(3BOP-daC12)
An assessment of the potential radiation shielding performances
of poly(3BOP-daC12) and the UHMWPE fiber/poly(3BOP-daC12) composite
was performed using NASA’s On-Line Tool for the Assessment
of Radiation in Space (OLTARIS).25 The
two materials were modeled in OLTARIS and subjected to simulated free-space
environments containing galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) and solar particle
events (SPEs). For GCR free-space simulations, the Badhwar-O’Neill
2010 GCR model and 1977 solar minimum event parameters were selected.
For SPE free-space simulations, the August 1972 (King) event parameter
was selected. GCR and SPE simulation parameters were selected based
on their use as cross-program design specifications for natural environments.26 Benchmark shielding materials were also modeled
and used for comparison. The materials and modeling parameters used
in OLTARIS simulations are provided in Table 6. The benchmark epoxy material used in simulations
was Cytec CYCOM
934 (formerly Fiberite 934), which is referenced by NASA radiation
shielding literature27 and is the matrix
resin used in the default graphite-epoxy composite found in OLTARIS.

Table 6 List of Materials and Modeling Parameters Used in
On-Line Tool for the Assessment of Radiation in
Space (OLTARIS) Simulations

poly(3BOP-daC12) polybenzoxazine	C36H56N2O4	1.07	
UHMWPE fiber/poly(3BOP-daC12) composite	CH2 (60 vol %)/C36H56N2O4 (40 vol %)	1.01	
Radiation shielding performance curves were developed by modeling
materials using the slab geometry option and performing multiple simulations
with slabs of increasing areal density from 1.0 to 30.0 g/cm2. Performance curves for the GCR environment are shown below in Figure 13. Shielding performance
is determined by examining the equivalent radiation dose (in mSv/day)
for all materials at a given areal density. A lower radiation dose
indicates better shielding performance. It is evident from these curves
that the shielding performance of the hydrogen-rich poly(3BOP-daC12)
polybenzoxazine is approaching that of polyethylene. Poly(3BOP-daC12)
provides superior radiation shielding properties compared to the benchmark
epoxy. The performance curve of the UHMWPE fiber/poly(3BOP-daC12)
composite material is shifted even closer to the polyethylene benchmark
curve. The level of improvement is provided by the increased hydrogen
concentration in the UHMWPE fibers and is directly related to the
amount of fiber contained within the composite; as the volume fraction
of fiber increases so too does the shielding performance. A fiber
volume fraction of 60% was used for the simulation, which is typical
for polymer matrix composites.

performance results for the
GCR free-space environment.

3.5 Tensile Properties of UHMWPE Fiber/Poly(3BOP-daC12)
Composites
Tensile testing of UHMWPE fiber/poly(3BOP-daC12)
composite samples was performed to evaluate tensile strength, tensile
modulus, Poisson’s ratio, and tensile strain at failure. A
total of 18 specimens were tested in accordance with ASTM D3039, using
three different environmental conditions (six specimens per condition).
Temperature and relative humidity parameters for each environmental
condition are listed in Table 7. Test specimens were laser cut from two 254 mm × 254
mm × 1.5 mm composite plates that were each comprised of eight
plies of plain-woven Spectra 1000 UHMWPE fabric (Style 932). Nominal
test specimen dimensions were 254 mm × 25.4 mm × 1.5 mm.
A summary of the mechanical properties obtained from this testing
is provided in Table 8. The results show excellent tensile properties suitable for structural
or semistructural applications.

4 Conclusions
A systematic
study of diamine-based benzoxazines synthesized from
phenols substituted in the meta position by alkoxy groups shows the
creation of polymers with relatively low polymerization temperature
for processing and adequate shelf-life (when stored under refrigerated
conditions).

The DSC and TGA studies demonstrate the influence
of the diamine
chain length on the reactivity of the benzoxazines and the stability
of the thermoset. The observed trend indicates that a longer chain
will increase the polymerization temperature, whereas simultaneously
decreasing the thermal stability of the polymer. The hydrogen concentration
for 3BOP-daC12 proves to be high enough to provide adequate shielding
capabilities compared to polyethylene and superior shielding properties
to epoxy (Cytec CYCOM 934). The composite material UHMWPE fiber/poly(3BOP-dac12)
further improves this behavior making it comparable to UHMWPE, which
was the main goal of this project. As a multifunctional material,
the UHMWPE fiber/poly(3BOP-daC12) composite offers a unique and attractive
combination of high-strength and excellent radiation shielding performance.
NASA plans to send samples of UHMWPE fiber/poly(3BOP-dac12) composites
to the International Space Station as part of Materials International
Space Station Experiment 12 (MISSE-12). MISSE-12 is scheduled to begin
in the fall of 2019 and continue for a duration of 1 year. Empirical
data related to radiation shielding performance are anticipated from
this testing.
