Organic
semiconductors are of interest for (opto)electronic applications
due to their low cost, solution processability, and tunable properties.
Recently, natural product-derived organic pigments attracted attention
due to their extraordinary environmental stability and unexpectedly
good optoelectronic performance, in spite of only partially conjugated
molecular structure. Fungi-derived pigments are a naturally sourced,
sustainable class of materials that are largely unexplored as organic
semiconductor materials. We present a study of the optical and electronic
properties of a fungi-derived pigment xylindein, which is secreted
by the wood-staining fungi Chlorociboria aeruginosa, and its blends with poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and crystalline
nanocellulose (CNC). Optical absorption spectra of xylindein revealed
the presence of two tautomers whose structures and properties were
established using density functional theory. Pronounced pigment aggregation
in polar solvents and in films, driven by intermolecular hydrogen
bonding, was also observed. The pigment exhibited high photostability,
electron mobility up to 0.4 cm2/(V s) in amorphous films,
and thermally activated charge transport and photoresponse with activation
energies of ∼0.3 and 0.2 eV, respectively. The dark and photocurrents
in xylindein:PMMA blends were comparable to those in pristine xylindein
film, whereas blends with CNC exhibited lower currents due to inhomogeneous
distribution of xylindein in the CNC.

Introduction
Organic (opto)electronic
materials are of interest due to their
low cost and tunable properties;1 a broad
range of their applications, from photovoltaics to three-dimensional
displays, have been demonstrated.2 Solution
processable materials that can be cast into thin films using various
solution deposition techniques are especially advantageous.3 One of the bottlenecks that complicates organic
materials processing and device fabrication, as well as hinders commercialization,
is their relatively low stability with respect to photo- and/or thermal
degradation. Therefore, organic (opto)electronic materials that exhibit
enhanced stability are of considerable interest.

Over the past
decade, there has been a considerable research effort
focusing on sustainable, natural product-derived materials for organic
electronics. These include biodegradable and biocompatible substrate
materials (e.g., polyester elastomers), polymer dielectric and electrodes,
and plant- or animal-derived active layers.4−6 Examples of
the latter include carotenoids, porphyrins, and anthraquinone derivatives,
with the most successful examples being the indigo and tyrian purple
dyes,5,7,8 which exhibited
ambipolar charge transport with balanced organic field-effect transistor
(OFET) carrier mobilities of 0.3–0.4 cm2/(V s) in
crystalline films. Additionally, indigo’s structural isomer,
isoindigo, has been used as a building block for donor−acceptor
(D/A) oligomers and co-polymers serving as donors in bulk heterojunction
organic solar cells with power conversion efficiencies of up to 8.2%.9 Another successful example is animal-derived
diketopyrrolopyrrole derivative used as a building block in D/A co-polymers
with OFET charge carrier mobilities of 10–12 cm2/(V s).9 Moreover, some derivatives, such
as quinacridone (derived from naturally occurring acridone), exhibited
extraordinary photoconductive properties: an external quantum efficiency
of 10% in a single-layer Schottky diode, three orders of magnitude
higher than that in benchmark pentacene films in a similar device
geometry.10 Success of the derivatives
of natural origin, and with unconventional molecular structure, has
been referred to as an exciting paradigm shift from the traditional
requirements of an organic semiconductor molecule to necessarily possess
a fully π-conjugated core, instead focusing on the importance
of H-bonding for photophysics and molecular packing.11 Additionally, many of such “unconventional”
derivatives exhibited an enhanced stability with respect to environmental
factors,12,13 thus addressing a major issue of performance
degradation in organic electronics. An example of unconventional and
highly stable molecule of potential interest for organic electronics
is xylindein, which is a blue-green pigment (Figure 1) secreted by the nonpathogenic wood-staining
fungi Chlorociboria aeruginosa. Many
fungi produce pigments for use in resource capture/territorial defense,
ultraviolet (UV) resistance, and prevention of desiccation. Only a
very selected group of fungi, generally the wood soft-rotting fungi
in the Ascomycetes, produce pigments that can penetrate deeply into
wood.14 These special pigments, referred
to as “spalting” pigments, have antifungal properties
and are secreted by fungi to defend territory (the wood matrix) while
they grow into the substrate. Spalting fungi generally grow very slowly,
and the distribution of the pigment into the wood allows them the
time they need to colonize. Since it can take years for a given spalting
fungus to colonize a log, the pigment it makes must be stable, under
UV light, in water, heat, and other extreme environmental conditions.
Their persistence is well documented, the blue-green pigment xylindein
of Figure 1 can be
found in intarsia and marquetry woodworks as far back as the 1400s,
still as vibrant as samples collected today.15,16 The two Chlorociboria species C.
aeruginosa and Chlorociboria aeruginascens, both of which produce xylindein, have a worldwide distribution,
and the wood stained by their colonization is readily available in
the Pacific Northwest of the United States, among many other regions.
Though pigment generation is slow in the wild, it can be significantly
increased under laboratory conditions and requires only standard 2%
malt agar substrates (with some added sterilized, rotted wood) for
growth.17−19 No additional heat, nutrients, or movement is required.

pigment xylindein on the decaying wood. (c) The extracted pigment

Recently, we specifically demonstrated that xylindein
shows extraordinary
stability under UV excitation and self-healing capabilities.20 Current interest in xylindein revolves primarily
around the controlled introduction of the pigment into high-value
wood products for aesthetic purposes.19,21 Here, we seek
to explore xylindein as a sustainable (opto)electronic material. We
also note that our toxicity studies indicate that xylindein is nontoxic
(see the Supporting Information), which
makes it potentially attractive for applications requiring biocompatibility.

The core structure of the xylindein molecule is a peri-xanthenoxanthene
(PXX),22−26 derivatives of which (3,9-diphenyl–PXX and 3,9-bis(p-propylphenyl)–PXX) were shown to exhibit hole mobilities
of up to ∼0.8–0.9 cm2/(V s)23,25 and unprecedented stability.27 In particular,
the reported OFETs remained considerably more stable over time with
exposure to oxygen, moisture, light, and heat as compared to similar
pentacene-based devices.23 PXX has also
been used as a donor in charge-transfer complexes for n-channel organic
field-effect transistors,28 and its radical
cation has been explored as a promising photo-oxidant.29 Thus far, attempts at xylindein synthesis have
proven incomplete.30 The structure of xylindein
was first reported in the 1960s31,32 but its absolute configuration
was unknown for many years, leading to a systematic re-examination
in 2000 to obtain the xylindein tautomeric structure.33 The developments utilizing derivatives with the PXX core23,25,27−29 and our promising
preliminary results incorporating xylindein in electronic devices34,35 motivated the present paper, in which we investigate in detail the
optical and (opto)electronic properties of naturally derived xylindein
and xylindein-based films. In particular, we report on electron mobilities
of up to 0.4 cm2/(V s) in amorphous pristine xylindein
and xylindein:PMMA films, combined with high photo- and thermal stability
of xylindein, and establish the mechanism of (photo)conduction in
these films. We also reveal the presence of xylindein tautomers and
aggregates and explore their contribution to optical and electronic
properties of xylindein solutions and films. Finally, toward the development
of sustainable naturally sourced electronic materials with enhanced
processability, we investigate optical and (opto)electronic properties
of blends of xylindein with crystalline nanocellulose (CNC).

Materials
and Methods
Extraction of Xylindein
Over the past 5 years, we have
developed a variety of protocols for cultivating fungi and extracting
fungi-produced pigments.36−38 Here, we focus on the wild-type
xylindein, sustainably obtained from the decaying wood (Figure 1a,b), leaving a detailed comparison
of characteristics of xylindein obtained via different preparation
and purification protocols to a separate publication. Wild-type xylindein
was harvested from wood (Figure 1a) collected at Tidewater, Oregon. Appropriate wood
was identified by the signature blue-green color produced by Chlorociboria species, which is unique across several kingdoms.
The Chlorociboria species responsible for staining
the wood was identified as C. aeruginosa through DNA extraction and Sanger sequencing of the internal transcribed
spacer region, followed by GenBank Megablast comparison (see the Supporting Information). The collected wood was
crushed into approximately 2–3 mm fragments. The powder was
placed in a 500 mL flask, with enough powder to cover the bottom of
the flask in an even layer. Dichloromethane (DCM, 100 mL) was poured
into the flask. The contents were then stirred on a magnetic stir
plate for 1 h before being filtered, as described in ref (39). The solid crude xylindein
was collected from the evaporated DCM solution, then sonicated in
ethanol to form a suspension of xylindein aggregates. The ethanol
solution was passed through a 0.45 μm poly(tetrafluoroethylene)
filter, followed by multiple passes of clean ethanol through the filter
to remove contaminants. The xylindein was removed from the filter
with DCM, and solvents evaporated to yield solid xylindein powder.

Mass Spectrometry
The analysis was performed on a Shimadzu
high-performance liquid chromatography (Columbia, MD) coupled to a
Waters Synapt HDRMS time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Milford, MA).
The MS was operated in the positive ion mode, 80–1000 m/z scan range, 1 s scan time. A binary
gradient and a 1.0 × 50 mm2 Waters XBridge C18 column
(Milford, MA) were used, for analytical separation. Solvent A consisted
of MS grade water (Fisher Scientific, Fairlawn, NJ) and 0.1% formic
acid (EMD Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA). Solvent B consisted
of MS grade acetonitrile (Fisher Scientific, Fairlawn, NJ) and 0.1%
formic acid. High-resolution mass spectrometry of xylindein resulted
in a measured mass of 569.1448 (M + H)+, corresponding
to the (M + H)+ ion, C32H25O10 (calculated exact mass of 569.1448, mass accuracy of 0.00
ppm), which is in agreement with the literature.31,33

Sample Preparation
For measurements of optical properties,
xylindein powder was dissolved in various solvents (Figure 1c) including DCM, chloroform
(CF), chlorobenzene (CB), tetrahydrofuran (THF), acetone (Ac), isopropyl
alcohol, and water at various concentrations in the 10–6–10–3 M range.

For the preparation
of films, three types of solutions were prepared: xylindein dissolved
in DCM at 10 mg/mL of the concentration, a mixture of 4 mg of xylindein
with 1 mg of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) (Aldrich, Mw = 15 000) dissolved in 500 μL of DCM to
form a 10 mg/mL solution, and a mixture of 4 mg of xylindein with
1 mg of crystalline nanocellulose (CNC) with 500 μL of formic
acid to form a 10 mg/mL solution. CNC powder with fiber dimensions
5–20 nm wide by 150–200 nm long was obtained from the
Process Development Center at the University of Maine.

For the
film preparation, solutions of pristine xylindein or xylindein:PMMA
or xylindein:CNC mixtures were drop-cast onto glass substrates patterned
with Al or Au/Cr co-planar or interdigitated electrodes spaced by
25–200 μm.40 The structure
and morphology of drop-cast films was assessed using scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), revealing the amorphous
structure and morphology depending on the mixture, with blends yielding
smoother films than pristine xylindein (Figure S1). The film thickness measured using a surface profilometer
ranged between 3 and 5 μm, depending on the device.

Measurements
For optical absorption measurements in
the solution and film, light from a halogen (LS-1, Ocean Optics) or
Xe lamp (Oriel 96000) transmitted through samples was measured using
an Ocean Optics USB2000 spectrometer. For photoluminescence (PL) measurements,
the solution or film samples were excited with 633 nm light (HeNe
laser). As the reference material for the PL quantum yield estimates,
previously studied functionalized pentacene (Pn) derivative Pn-TIPS-F8
(also known as F8 TIPS-Pn) with QY = 0.6 in toluene was used.41 PL emission was collected using an Ocean Optics
USB2000-FLG spectrometer, as described in our previous publications.42,43 Measurements of optical absorption and PL in films were conducted
on an inverted microscope (Olympus IX-71) with a 10× objective
in transmission and reflection geometry, respectively.

For measurements
of photostability, 10 μM solutions of xylindein in chlorobenzene
and of benchmark organic semiconductors, functionalized fluorinated
anthradithiophene (ADT) derivative diF (triethylsilyl)ethynyl (TES)-ADT,
and functionalized pentacene (triisopropylsilyl)ethynyl (TIPS)-Pn,
in toluene were prepared,41,42,44,45 and their optical absorption
measured. The spectra were integrated in the S0–S1 absorption region (600–700 nm for xylindein, 450–550
nm for diF TES-ADT, and 560–660 nm for TIPS-Pn) yielding a
data point at time t = 0. The solutions in vials
sealed with a paraffin film to prevent solvent evaporation were then
placed under the fume hood lights, in air, and the spectral measurement
was repeated at various time intervals. The S0–S1 spectra were integrated and the result normalized by that
at t = 0. The experiment was carried out up to 30
weeks.

For measurements of thermal stability, pristine xylindein
films
were placed on a hot plate held at a particular temperature in the
50–200 °C range for 2 h, in air. The absorption spectrum
of the film was measured every 5 min. The spectra were integrated
in the S0–S1 absorption region (600–750
nm) and plotted as a function of time, normalized at the value at t = 0.

For measurements of current–voltage
characteristics, the
voltage was applied to the samples using a Keithley 237 source measure
unit, and current in the dark was measured as a function of applied
voltage ranging from 0 to 300 V.

Continuous wave (cw) photocurrents
in films were measured under
633 nm, 2 mW/cm2 photoexcitation chopped using an optical
chopper at 100 Hz. The voltage was applied to the samples using a
Keithley 237 source measure unit, and the photocurrent was measured
using a Stanford Research Systems (SRS830) lock-in amplifier.

For temperature-dependent measurements, samples were incorporated
in an optical cryostat (Janis STC-500), and dark current and photocurrent
measurements were carried out in the vacuum in the temperature range
of 300–350 K.

Density Functional Theory (DFT) Calculations
The structure
of xylindein was optimized using DFT methods in Gaussian 16 to ascertain
the location and orientation of xylindein’s hydroxyl groups.
Initial structures of the molecule were optimized with the B3LYP function
and 6-31G(d,p) basis set. Only configurations with centralized hydroxyl
groups (Figure 1d)
were found to be energetically stable, and of those, only two were
found to have negligible dipole moments (Figure S2a,b), in keeping with our observations of enhanced solubility
of xylindein in nonpolar, as compared to polar, solvents (discussed
below). These two tautomers A and B were then optimized with a larger
basis set (6-311G++(d,p)) to find the energies of the highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO).
Time-dependent DFT methods were applied to find the energies of the
vertical first allowed singlet excited state for xylindein embedded
in the DCM solvent environment. A similar optimization process was
conducted for dimethylxylindein (Figure S3), yielding only a single configuration. Properties of dimethylxylindein,
embedded in a DCM solvent environment, were also calculated to assess
the contribution of the OH groups, not present in dimethylxylindein,
to various characteristics of xylindein. Control calculations were
also conducted on several derivatives of peri-xanthenozanthene (PXX)
for comparisons with the literature, which are included in the Supporting Information.

Fit Procedure
The dilute solution absorption spectra
of xylindein were initially fit using a vibronic progression model
of eq 1(2,46−48) 1  Here,  represents the reduced
absorption as a
function of photon energy and A0 is a
scale factor for the integrated absorption of the exciton manifold. EX is the 0–0 energy, EV is the vibrational energy, n is an
index for the number of vibrational quanta hosted by the molecule,
and S is the corresponding Huang–Rhys factor.
Each optical transition is modeled with a Lorentzian line shape Γ,
with a full width at half maximum of σ0 (1 + nΔσ). Here, σ0 is the 0–0
broadening, and Δσ is the dimensionless progressive broadening
factor, which corrects for vibrational modes not explicitly treated
in the model.47

It was found that
a single vibronic progression of eq 1 was insufficient to model the fine details in the
xylindein spectra, so the spectra were then fit assuming the convolution
of two vibronic progressions:  (Figure 2b), each characterized by their own parameters EX, EV, S, σ0, and Δσ (Table 1).

in chlorobenzene (CB),
chloroform (CF), and tetrahydrofuran (THF). (b) The absorption spectrum
in DCM divided by ℏω and fit using two vibronic progressions,
each described by eq 1. The fit parameters are listed in Table 1. The sum of the contributions of the two
tautomers to the spectra is also included.

Results and Discussion
Optical
Properties
Optical absorption spectra of xylindein
solutions in solvents of various polarities are shown in Figures 2 and S4. The most pronounced effect of the solvent
polarity on xylindein spectra was in the solvent polarity-dependent
propensity of xylindein for aggregation. At comparable concentrations,
the contribution of xylindein aggregates to the spectra, which lead
to the appearance of a new absorption band peaked at about ∼710–720
nm, was considerably higher as the solvent polarity increased. For
example, in THF (dielectric constant ε = 7.9), the aggregate
peak was pronounced at already 40 μM, whereas it was not present
at 60 μM in CB (ε = 5.6), as shown in Figure S5a,b. For highly polar solvents, such as isopropyl
alcohol (ε = 20), acetone (ε = 21), and water (ε
= 80), even at micromolar concentrations, the aggregate peak was strongly
pronounced (Figures 3a and S4). This is consistent with xylindein
being a nonpolar molecule, and so its solubility in polar solvents
is greatly reduced. The aggregates were also responsible for the near-infrared
absorption spectra of xylindein-based films (Figure 3a) showing absorption features similar to
those for xylindein in water.

Figure 3 (a) Absorption spectra and (b) PL spectra obtained
at 633 nm excitation
of xylindein in solutions (e.g., in DCM and in water in (a) and in
DCM in (b)), in pristine film, and in blends with PMMA and CNC. Symbols
described in the legend of (a) also apply to (b). The PL spectra in
(b) were not corrected for self-absorption.

To better understand the absorption spectra of xylindein,
we fit
the spectra as described in Materials and Methods. The parameters obtained from fits to the spectra of dilute solutions
in CB and DCM are summarized in Table 1. The spectra of dilute solutions in these solvents
exhibit a similar structure that can be fit by a sum of two vibronic
progressions, each described by eq 1 (Figure 2b). To understand the origin of the complicated structure of the
S0–S1 spectrum of xylindein, we also
modeled the absorption spectrum of the dimethylxylindein, in which
the OH groups are substituted by the OMe groups (Figure S3b). The absorption spectrum of dimethylxylindein
in DCM produced a good fit with one vibronic progression of eq 1, as shown in Figure S3a. Therefore, we attribute the need
for two vibronic progressions to adequately describe the S0–S1 spectrum of xylindein to the presence of two
tautomers, which exhibit slightly different energies for the 0–0
transition (EX) and parameters describing
the line shape and vibronic coupling in eq 1. Molecular structures of such tautomers were
identified using DFT calculations as described in Materials and Methods and are shown in Figure S2a,b, with the relative contributions of tautomers
A and B to the absorption spectra of about 30:70 (A0 in Table 1). Their calculated vertical energies, which are comparable to the
0–0 energies (EX) extracted from
fits to the experimental data, are also included in Table 1.

In all xylindein solutions,
the PL quantum yields measured at 633
nm excitation of the S0–S1 transition
were below 0.1%. Such low quantum yields have been observed in other
pigments such as indigo, for which it was attributed to the intramolecular
proton transfer.12,49 The mechanism of nonradiative
energy relaxation in xylindein is currently under investigation and
will be reported in our subsequent publication. The PL spectra obtained
under 633 nm excitation of a DCM solution and of xylindein-based films
are shown in Figure 3b. All films studied featured similar PL spectra, with a pronounced
peak at ∼900 nm, which we attribute to xylindein aggregates.
A similar peak was observed in concentrated solutions (e.g., at ∼870
nm, in addition to the xylindein monomer peak at ∼710 nm in Figure 3b), with the aggregate
contribution increasing and exhibiting a red-shift with the xylindein
concentration, due to changes in the dielectric environment.

Stability
Figure 4 illustrates
a considerably higher photostability of
xylindein in the solution as compared to solutions of benchmark organic
semiconductors TIPS-Pn and diF TES-ADT.42,43 In particular,
under continuous illumination in air, the TIPS-Pn molecules in the
solution decomposed within 3 days. The fluorinated ADT derivative,
diF TES-ADT, which has been photostable enough to enable its use as
a fluorophore in single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy,41 showed a gradual degradation over the period
of first several weeks followed by an accelerated degradation starting
at about 5 weeks. Under the same conditions, no degradation in optical
absorption of xylindein was observed over the period of about 25 weeks,
after which some degradation occurred (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Integrated S0–S1 spectra, normalized
at time t = 0, of dilute solutions of xylindein and
of benchmark organic semiconductors TIPS-Pn and diF TES-ADT continuously
exposed to light and air.

Enhanced photostability of pigments has been their known
property
for a long time, fostering their applications in art throughout the
history50,51 and more recently, as food colorants, paints,52 and, finally, organic electronic devices.8,13,53,54 The origin of high photostability depends on the molecular structure.
For example, the photostability of indigo and its derivatives has
been attributed to subpicosecond-excited intramolecular proton transfer
leading to a rapid internal conversion.12,49 This leads
to short excited-state lifetimes, low PL quantum yields, and high
photostability. Similar considerations could be operational in xylindein;
ultrafast spectroscopy, which is necessary to quantify the picosecond
time-scale excited-state dynamics and to reveal the contributing mechanism,
is underway, and results will be reported elsewhere.

Xylindein
also exhibited a relatively good thermal stability in
air. For example, no considerable degradation of optical properties
of xylindein films was observed upon holding the xylindein film at
temperatures up to 100 °C in the air for at least 2 h (Figure S6). About 8 and 15% degradation occurred
at 150 and 175 °C, respectively, after 2 h. At 200 °C, pronounced
degradation occurred within the first 20 min of the heat treatment.

(Opto)electronic Properties
To better understand electronic
properties of xylindein, we performed DFT calculations of the HOMO
and LUMO orbitals for the tautomers A and B (Figure S2a,b, respectively) revealed by the combination of optical
spectroscopy and DFT calculations. The HOMO and LUMO energies yielded
−6.49 (−6.30) and −4.31 (−3.99) eV, respectively,
for the tautomer A (B), resulting in the HOMO–LUMO gap of 2.19
(2.31) eV, as shown in Figure 5. The calculated HOMO and LUMO charge densities for both tautomers
are shown in Figure S2c–f. The low
LUMO energies of xylindein suggest preferential electron or ambipolar
transport, in contrast to the unsubstituted PXX, which favors hole
transport.24 Results from the cyclic voltammetry
are consistent with this prediction, and the reversible reduction
in xylindein was confirmed experimentally, as described in the Supporting
information (Figure S7).

Figure 5 HOMO and LUMO energy
levels for two xylindein tautomers. Work functions
of Al and Au relative to the HOMO and LUMO energies are also shown.

To explore electron transport
in xylindein films, we prepared films
on aluminum (Al) electrodes to facilitate electron injection expected
from a relatively good alignment of Al work function with LUMO energies
of xylindein (Figure 5). Figure 6 shows
current–voltage (I–V) characteristics for two pristine xylindein films and for a xylindein:PMMA
film, all on co-planar Al electrodes. The Ohmic response followed
by a characteristic transition from the linear (I–V) to the space-charge-limited current (SCLC)
(I–V2) regime
was observed in all samples. In the case of the planar electrode geometry
used in our experiments, the current flows along a thin layer of unknown
thickness, and the current density (j) is expressed
in units of A/m (as opposed to A/m2 for the “sandwich”
electrode geometry). Although there is no analytical solution for
the relationship between the SCLC linear current density (j) and the applied voltage (V) in a film
of finite thickness on co-planar electrodes, there are solutions for
the extreme cases of the infinitely thin film (“thin-film approximation”)
and the infinite half-space (“infinite half-space approximation”).40 In the thin-film approximation, the linear current
density40j = (2/π)μeffεε0V2/L2. Here, j = I/d, where I is the measured
current and d is the length of the electrode, L is the gap between the electrodes, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, ε is the dielectric constant (assumed
here to be equal to 3), and μeff is the effective
mobility. The SCLC j–V dependence
in the infinite half-space approximation differs from the expression
above only in the coefficient 2/π, which is replaced by 0.28.40 The thin-film approximation for our devices
is justified by the ≤5 μm film thicknesses as compared
to the gap between the electrodes (L) of 50–200
μm chosen for these experiments. From SCLC currents (the inset
of Figure 6), values
for the effective mobility in the 0.1–0.4 cm2/(V
s) range were obtained using the thin-film approximation, depending
on the device, in pristine xylindein films. We consider these values
to be lower bound estimates to the electron mobility, as the trap-free
SCLC regime was not reached in our measurements and, thus, the intrinsic
mobility is higher. We also note that the performance of xylindein-based
devices depends on the fungi growth and purification protocols,55 and higher mobilities could be possible with
protocols other than the one used in the present study; this is currently
under investigation. Achieving effective mobility values above 0.1
cm2/(V s) is rather remarkable given that the films under
study are amorphous, illustrating benefits of an interplay of intermolecular
hydrogen bonding (Figure S8) and π–π
stacking, afforded by the molecular structure of xylindein, for charge
transport.

Figure 6 Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics for pristine xylindein and xylindein:PMMA films
on co-planar Al electrodes with a 200 μm gap, showing the transition
from the linear to the quadratic (SCLC) regime. The inset shows I vs V2 and linear fits, slopes
of which were used to calculate the effective mobilities assuming
the thin-film approximation of the SCLCs in the planar electrode geometry,
as discussed in the text.

As xylindein tends to form porous and inhomogeneous films34 (Figure S1a), to
improve film processability, we also explored its blends with a polymer
PMMA and a biopolymer CNC (both of which exhibited negligible electric
currents in the absence of xylindein, thus providing a nonconductive
scaffold for the xylindein molecules). The use of PMMA was inspired
by our own56 and other literature57,58 studies of electronic properties of small-organic-semiconductor
molecule:nonconductive polymer blends, which exhibited improved morphology
and comparable or better electronic performance than that of pristine
organic semiconductor films. The naturally sourced CNC was chosen
to explore the possibility of creating the all-sustainable functional
xylindein:polymer blend. Both blends yielded considerably smoother
films (Figure S1b,c) as compared to xylindein
films, with optical properties similar to those of pristine xylindein
film (Figure 3), which
suggests that the nature of xylindein aggregates is similar in all
films. The xylindein:PMMA films yielded electric characteristics similar
to those of the pristine xylindein films (Figures 6 and 7), with the
SCLC effective mobilities similar to those in the pristine xylindein
film (e.g., 0.26 cm2/(V s) in the xylindein:PMMA film in Figure 6). The xylindein:CNC
films exhibited electric currents and corresponding SCLC effective
mobilities that were more than an order of magnitude lower than those
in pristine xylindein or xylindein:PMMA blends, most likely due to
a nonuniform distribution of xylindein in the CNC at high concentrations,
which prevents the formation of the efficient conductive network via
xylindein molecules.

Figure 7 Current–voltage characteristics for pristine xylindein,
xylindein:PMMA, and xylindein:CNC films on interdigitated Au electrodes
with a 25 μm gap. The inset shows the high-voltage data for
these three films replotted as a function of V2, with linear fits that were used to calculate effective mobilities
in the thin-film approximation of the SCLC in the planar electrode
geometry, as discussed in the text.

In planar devices using gold (Au) electrodes, the transition
from
the linear to the quadratic SCLC regime was also observed in the current–voltage
characteristics; however, it occurred at considerably higher voltages
as compared to those in devices with Al electrodes, reflecting differences
in the charge carrier injection properties depending on the electrode
material. From the I vs V2 linear fits to the SCLC regime in devices on planar Au electrodes
(the inset of Figure 7), in the thin-film approximation, one obtains the effective mobilities
μeff of ∼0.01, 0.016, and 7 × 10–4 cm2/(V s) in pristine xylindein, xylindein:PMMA,
and xylindein:CNC films, respectively. If the hole injection is dominant
in these devices, the μeff values represent a lower
bound on the hole mobility in these systems, as the trap-free regime
was not achieved in these devices.59 However,
based on the alignment of the Au work function with the energy levels
of xylindein (Figure 5), it is not clear whether the injection of a single type of the
carrier can be ensured, in which case, the interpretation of the effective
charge carrier mobility is considerably less straightforward60 and it relies on the knowledge of recombination
mobility, which is not known for our materials.

To probe the
mechanism of conduction in xylindein-based films,
we performed temperature-dependent measurements of electric currents
in the dark and under a 633 nm cw photoexcitation. All samples exhibited
a thermally activated response (∼exp[−Ea/kBT], where Ea is the activation energy, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is
the temperature) characterized by the activation energies Ea of 0.31, 0.25, and 0.24 eV for the dark currents
in pristine xylindein, xylindein:PMMA, and xylindein:CNC films, respectively
(Figure 8a). Such temperature
dependence is, for example, characteristic of a hopping charge-transport
mechanism in the exponentially distributed manifold of trap states
with a characteristic energy Ea.61 The obtained values of Ea are similar to those in a variety of amorphous polymers (e.g., Ea = 0.33 and 0.37 eV in polyfluorene-based derivatives
poly(9,9′-dioctylfluorene-co-bis-N,N′-(4-butylphenyl)-bis-N,N′-phenyl-1,4-phenylene-diamine) and poly(9,9′-dioctylfluorene-co-benzothiadiazole), respectively) and organic glasses.62−66 A reduction in the activation energy in blends as compared to pristine
xylindein films is consistent with a more uniform morphology achieved
in blends although one could argue that larger differences in the
activation energies would be expected from the three types of samples
with different morphologies used in our studies. It has been demonstrated
that in organic semiconductor devices, the activation energy in charge
carrier mobility measurements may have contributions from charge traps
both from the bulk organic semiconductor material and from the interface
with a substrate (formed by strain due to the mismatch in the thermal
expansion coefficients between the organic semiconductor and the substrate).
For example, the latter accounted for up to ∼0.1 eV differences
in the activation energy observed in mobilities of P3HT transistors
depending on the gate dielectric.67 If
the charge traps at the interface were responsible for most of the Ea in our samples, this would suggest that at
the film–substrate interface, there is a thin xylindein layer
with only a slightly different morphology in all three types of samples
used in our studies. It is also interesting to note that the values
of Ea are similar to the differences in
the LUMO energy levels for the two xylindein tautomers, and so the
presence of the two tautomers with offset energies, rather than the
specific morphology of the films or of the interfacial layer, could
dominate the disorder contributing to charge transport.

Figure 8 Temperature
dependence of dark (a) and photo (b) currents obtained
in pristine xylindein, xylindein:PMMA, and xylindein:CNC films on
interdigitated Au electrodes with a 25 μm gap at 100 V. Arrhenius
fits (∼exp[−Ea/kBT]) with the extracted activation energies Ea are also included. The temperature dependence
was independent of the applied voltage in the range studied.

All three types of xylindein-based
films also exhibited photoresponse
to a 633 nm continuous wave (cw) excitation.34,35 The temperature dependence of the photocurrents revealed slightly
lower activation energies as compared to dark currents (0.2 eV in
pristine xylindein and 0.18 eV in xylindein-based blends), as shown
in Figure 8b. These
values are comparable to those obtained from photocurrents in various
amorphous organic materials,68−70 and the lower activation energies
as compared to dark current activation energies have also been observed
in organic glasses,69 reflecting a slightly
narrower energy manifold sampled by the photoexcited charge carriers
as compared to injected carriers.

Conclusions
Optical
and (opto)electronic properties of a naturally derived
pigment xylindein and its blends with PMMA and CNC are presented.
The analysis of the optical spectra revealed the presence of two tautomers
whose structures and properties were explored using DFT. The propensity
for xylindein aggregation depended on the solvent polarity and was
strongly pronounced in polar solvents. Aggregates with similar optical
properties were observed in films. Excellent photostability was observed
in xylindein solutions as compared to those of benchmark organic semiconductor
molecules. Electron mobility of up to 0.4 cm2/(V s) was
obtained in amorphous films at room temperature. Both dark and photocurrent
were thermally activated with activation energies of 0.3 and 0.2 eV,
respectively, in pristine xylindein films. Xylindein blends with PMMA
exhibited (opto)electronic performance comparable to that of pristine
xylindein films. In xylindein blends with CNC, both dark and photocurrents
were at least an order of magnitude lower than in pristine xylindein
films. In both blends, the charge-transport activation energies were
lower (0.25 eV) than in pristine xylindein films due to a smoother
film morphology, as revealed by the SEM.
