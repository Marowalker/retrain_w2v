Diacylglycerol
kinase ζ (DGKζ) phosphorylates diacylglycerol
(DG) to generate phosphatidic acid. The dysfunction of DGKζ
has been linked to several diseases, such as cardiac hypertrophy,
ischemia, and seizures. Moreover, much attention has been paid to
DGKζ, together with DGKα, as a potential target for cancer
immunotherapy. However, DGKζ has never been purified and, thus,
neither its enzymatic properties nor its structure has yet been reported,
hindering our understanding of the catalytic mechanism of DGKζ
and the development of a reasonable structure-based drug design. In
the present study, we generated a full-length DGKζ using a baculovirus–insect
cell expression system for enzymological and structural studies. Full-length
DGKζ remained soluble and was purified to near homogeneity as
a monomer with yields suitable for protein crystallization (0.63 mg/1
L culture). Enzymatic characterization showed that the purified DGKζ
is in a fully functional state. The Km values for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and DG were 0.05 mM and
1.5 mol %, respectively, and the EC50 for the activator phosphatidylserine
was 8.6 mol %, indicating that its affinity for ATP is moderately
higher than those of DGKα and DGKε, and its affinities
for DG and phosphatidylserine are comparable to those of DGKα/DGKε.
We further confirmed that the purified enzyme could be concentrated
without any significant aggregation. Circular dichroism revealed that
DGKζ is comprised of 25% α-helices and 18% β-strands.
This is the first successful purification and characterization of
the enzymatic and conformational properties of DGKζ. The purification
of DGKζ allows detailed analyses of this important enzyme and
will advance our understanding of DGKζ-related diseases and
therapies.

Introduction
Diacylglycerol kinase
(DGK) phosphorylates diacylglycerol (DG)
to produce phosphatidic acid (PA).1−4 DG is well known to be an activator of conventional
and novel protein kinase C (PKC), Ras guanyl nucleotide-releasing
protein, chimaerins, and Unc-13.5−7 Moreover, PA has been reported
to regulate the activities of many physiologically important enzymes
such as Ras GTPase-activating protein, phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate
kinase, Raf-1 (C-Raf) kinase, atypical PKC, and mammalian target of
Rapamycin.8,9 Thus, DGK appears to participate in a wide
variety of physiological and pathological events by controlling the
balance between two lipid second messengers, DG and PA.

To date,
10 mammalian DGK isozymes (α, β, γ,
δ, ε, ζ, η, θ, ι, and κ)
have been identified. These DGK isozymes are divided into five groups
(type I (α, β, and γ), II (δ, η, and
κ), III (ε), IV (ζ and ι), and V (θ))
according to their structural features.1−4 Type IV DGK isozymes (ζ and ι)
commonly contain two C1 domains at the N-terminus, a MARCKS-like domain,
four ankyrin repeats, and a PDZ domain at the C-terminus in addition
to a catalytic domain (CD).10

DGKζ
is a versatile enzyme. Topham et al. revealed that reducing
nuclear DG levels through the action of DGKζ attenuated cell
proliferation.11 Liu et al. reported that
DGKζ constitutes a downstream component of the leptin signaling
pathway in the hypothalamus.12 In NIE-115
neuroblastoma cells, DGKζ promotes neurite outgrowth.13 We previously showed that retinoic acid-induced
neurite outgrowth was attenuated by a deficiency of DGKζ, which
produced 16:0/16:0-PA species in Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells.14 In that study, we observed the role of DGKζ
in the morphological changes at the initial/early stages of neuronal
differentiation. Rac1 is essential for retinoic acid-induced neurite
extension of Neuro-2a cells.15 DGKζ-derived
PA activates p21-activated protein kinase 1, which induces the release
of Rac1 from Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors.16 DGKζ-mediated synaptic conversion of DG
to PA is involved in the maintenance of dendritic spines.17 In addition, DGKζ attenuates the hypertrophic
signaling cascade and resultant cardiac hypertrophy in response to
Gq protein-coupled receptor agonists.18 DGKζ in hippocampal neurons is involved in global ischemia19 and kainate-induced seizures.20 Moreover, we now recognize the importance of DGKζ
as a physiological negative regulator of T-cell receptor signaling
and T-cell activation. DGKζ-deficient T cells were hyperresponsive
to T-cell receptor stimulation both ex vivo and in vivo.21,22 Therefore, it is thought that selective inhibitors of DGKζ
enhance T-cell receptor signaling and, consequently, can be promising
anticancer drugs through cancer immunity.23−26

However, despite their
physiological and biomedical importance,
no structural and enzymatic properties of DGKζ have been determined,
hindering our understanding of the catalytic mechanism of DGKζ
and the development of a reasonable structure-based medicine design.
In the present study, a full-length human DGKζ expressed in
the soluble form in the baculovirus–insect cell expression
system was successfully purified to near homogeneity as a monomer
by a series of column chromatographies. The purified protein was fully
active. Interestingly, the enzymatic parameters of DGKζ are
different from those of other DGK isozymes.

Materials and Methods
Expression
of DGKζ in Insect Cells Using a Baculovirus
Expression Vector System
Expression of human full-length
DGKζ (DGKζ-FL) and its catalytic domain (CD) alone (DGKζ-CD)
was performed as previously described.27 The constructs of DGKζ-FL10 (aa
1–928 (UniProt accession ID: DGKZ Q13574-2)) or DGKζ-CD
(aa 276–629) with an N-terminal His × 6 tag were amplified
by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into the pOET3 vector (Oxford
Expression Technologies, Oxford, U.K.) at SalI/NotI sites.

Purification
of DGKζ Expressed in Insect Cells
Purification of DGKζ-FL
and DGKζ-CD using nickel-nitrilotriacetic
acid (Ni-NTA) agarose (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands) and a Superdex
200 column 16/60 (GE Healthcare (Chicago, IL)) was performed as previously
described.27 Collected fractions were analyzed
by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
followed by Coomassie blue staining and Western blot analysis using
the anti-DGKζ antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
CA). Protein quantification was performed by the Bradford assay or
using the absorbance of a 1% solution of the protein in a 1 cm pathlength
cell at 280 nm (E1% = 11.4).

DGKζ
Activity Assay in Vitro
The activity of
DGKζ-FL was analyzed using the octyl-β-d-glucoside
mixed micelle assay followed by the ADP-Glo kinase assay (Promega,
Madison, WI) as previously described.28,29 To determine
the kinetic constants, the activity assay was performed under a series
of concentrations of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (20–200 μm)
and DG (0–5.4 mol %). For each reaction, 14.4 ng of purified
DGKζ was added, and the assays were performed in triplicate
for each ATP and DG concentration. The Km value was obtained by fitting the kinase activity of DGKζ
with the Michaelis–Menten equation using Prism 5 (GraphPad
Software, La Jolla, CA).

Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy
Circular dichroism
spectra were recorded under ambient conditions between 190 and 250
nm on a Jasco J-805 spectrometer (Jasco Corporation) using a cell
with a path length of 0.2 mm, a scan speed of 60 nm/min, and a bandwidth
of 1 nm. DGKζ for the spectrometry was prepared at 0.33 mg/mL
(3.1 μm) in 20 mM Tris–HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl,
3 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol. Five
spectra were averaged and the spectrum obtained for the buffer was
subtracted. Spectral data were analyzed using the program K2X30 suited in the DICHROWEB platform (http://dichroweb.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/html/home.shtml).31

Statistical Analysis
Statistical comparisons were performed
using a two-tailed t-test or a one-way analysis of
variance followed by a Tukey’s test.

Results
Expression
and Purification of Full-Length DGKζ
It is difficult
to express soluble and active DGK in bacterial expression
systems. Therefore, we chose the baculovirus–Sf9 cell system
to express DGKζ. Human DGKζ was reported to exist in two
alternatively spliced forms.10,32 We selected human DGKζ1,10 which is ubiquitously expressed.10,32 The catalytic domain is an essential target for inhibitor development.
Thus, we first attempted to express human DGKζ-CD (aa 276–629)
in Sf9 cells. The cDNA construct of DGKζ-CD (Figure S1A) with an N-terminal His × 6 tag was expressed
in Sf9 insect cells and purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography
(Figure S1B). However, DGKζ-CD was
not highly soluble (64% soluble) (Figure S1B) and was recovered in flow-through fractions in Ni-NTA affinity
chromatography. Therefore, the amount of Ni-NTA-purified DGKζ-CD
was low (85 μg/L of Sf9 cell culture) (Figure S1C).

We previously reported that the full-length DGKα
expressed in Sf9 cells was soluble.27 We
therefore tried to produce human DGKζ-FL (aa 1–928) (Figure 1A) using the baculovirus
expression system. Western blot analysis showed that 96% of DGKζ-FL
was soluble after cell lysis (Figure 1B). DGKζ was purified using Ni-affinity chromatography
from the cell lysis supernatant and eluted in the fractions containing
50 and 100 mM imidazole (Figure 1C). Next, to further purify DGKζ-FL, size-exclusion
chromatography on a Superdex 200 column was performed after concentration.
DGKζ-FL was eluted as a single peak at the molecular mass of
125 kDa based on a calibration curve obtained with molecular mass
standard proteins (Figure 1D). The calculated molecular mass of His × 6-tagged DGKζ-FL
is 106 kDa (DGKζ (∼104 kDa) + His × 6 tag (∼2
kDa)).10,33 Therefore, it is likely that DGKζ-FL
exists as a monomer in solution. Overall, DGKζ-FL was purified
to near homogeneity (Figure 1E), and the yield was ∼0.63 mg per 1 L of Sf9 cell
culture.

gel-filtration column using protein standards of known molecular weight
(thyroglobulin (670 kDa), γ-globulin (158 kDa), ovalbumin (44
kDa), and myoglobin (17 kDa)). The partition coefficient (Kav) was calculated from the formula Kav = (VE – V0)/(VT – V0), where VE is
the retention volume of each sample, VT is the total column volume (120 mL), and V0 is the void volume of the column (44 mL). Kav was plotted against the molecular weight of the proteins,
and linear regression analysis was conducted. (E) SDS-PAGE (7.5%)
analysis of DGKζ-FL purified using size-exclusion chromatography.

Enzymatic Properties of
Purified DGKζ
To examine
whether the purified DGKζ-FL is catalytically active, we performed
the octyl-β-D-glucoside mixed micellar assay followed by a luminescence-based
assay that measures the adenosine diphosphate (ADP) produced in a
kinase reaction.28,29 DGKζ purified via size-exclusion
chromatography was found to show strong kinase activity, and its specific
activity was 3.6 nmol PA/min/μg. This value is comparable to
those obtained from DGKα (type I isozyme) purified from porcine
thymus (2.4 nmol PA/min/μg),34 DGKα
from the baculovirus–insect cell expression system (2.0 nmol
PA/min/μg),27 and DGKε (type
III isozyme) purified from the baculovirus–insect cell expression
system (3.8 nmol PA/min/μg).35 Moreover,
no significant changes in the activity were observed after storage
of the purified DGKζ at −80 °C for at least 1 month.

We also determined the kinetic parameters of DGKζ for ATP
and DG to assess its catalytic properties. An ATP-dependent increase
in the kinase activity was detected (Figure 2A), and the Km value was determined to be 0.050 ± 0.005 mM (Vmax: 4.05 ± 0.17 nmol PA/min/μg) (Table 1). The Km values for ATP obtained with DGKα purified from
porcine thymus, expressed in COS-7 cells, and purified from the baculovirus–insect
cell expression system were 0.1,34 0.24,27 and 0.1–0.25 mM,28,29 respectively. DGKε purified from bovine testis showed a Km value for ATP of 0.09–0.10 mM.36 We recently reported that the Km value for ATP of DGKη (type II isozyme) expressed
in COS-7 cells was 0.052 mM.37 Taken together,
the Km value of DGKζ (type IV isozyme)
for ATP is lower than those of DGKα (type I isozyme) and DGKε
(type III isozyme) and comparable to that of DGKη (type II isozyme).

and (B) DG activity dependencies of the purified DGKζ as measured

a function of (A) ATP concentration (mM) or (B) DG concentration (mol
%). Measured luminescence values were converted into the amount of
ADP produced (nmol) based on the ATP-to-ADP conversion curve measured
separately with a known concentration of ATP (50 μm to 1 mM).
Data are represented as the mean ± SD for triplicate measurements.

a Mixed micellar
assay was performed
to test the enzymatic activity over a series of substrate concentrations.
The kinetic parameters were obtained as shown in Figure 2. Data shown are mean ±
standard deviation (SD) for triplicate measurements.

The activity also increased in a
DG concentration-dependent manner
(Figure 2B), and the Km value was 1.49 ± 0.12 mol % (Vmax: 2.12 ± 0.06 nmol PA/min/μg)
(Table 1). This value
is comparable to those from our previous studies with DGKα purified
from porcine thymus (3.3 mol %),34 from
the baculovirus–insect cell expression system (1.1 mol %),
and expressed in COS-7 cells (1.9–3.4 mol %).28,29 The Km value for DG of DGKε purified
from bovine testis was 2.4 mM.36 On the
other hand, the value of DGKη expressed in COS-7 cells was 0.14
mol %.37 Thus, the Km value of DGKζ for DG is comparable to those of both
DGKα and DGKε and higher than that of DGKη.

DGK is generally activated by an anionic phospholipid phosphatidylserine
(PS).38 PS was reported to increase the
activity of DGKζ in insect Sf21 cell lysates.39 Thus, we next examined the effect of PS on the activity
of purified DGKζ (Figure 1). As shown in Figure 3, we confirmed that DGKζ activity increased in a PS-dependent
manner. The ED50 value for PS was 8.6 mol % (Figure 3). The PS ED50 values
for DGKα purified from porcine thymus and expressed in COS-7
cells were 1627 and 9 mol %,37 respectively. The ED50 value of DGKη
for PS was 8.5 mol %.37 Therefore, The
ED50 value of DGKζ for PS is comparable to those
of both DGKα and DGKη.

Figure 3 Effect of PS on purified DGKζ activity:
purified DGKζ
was incubated with various concentrations of PS as indicated for 5
min. Concentrations of the nonvaried assay components were 0.2 mM
ATP and 5.4 mol % DG. Data are represented as the means ± SD
for triplicate measurements.

DGKζ was reported to show no DG species selectivity.10,32 We analyzed the activities of purified DGKζ in the presence
of several DG species, 12:0/12:0-, 16:0/16:0-, 16:0/18:1-, 18:1/18:1-,
18:0/18:0-, 18:0/20:4-, and 18:0/22:6-DG, as the substrate. When the
activity with 12:0/12:0-DG was set to 100%, activities with 16:0/16:0-,
16:0/18:1-, 18:1/18:1-, 18:0/18:0-, 18:0/20:4-, and 18:0/22:6-DG were
all 78–108% (Figure 4). Thus, we confirmed that this isozyme does not have selectivity
for a particular DG species (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Effects of various DG species on the activity of purified
DGKζ.
The purified DGKζ was incubated with 12:0/12:0-DG, 16:0/16:0-DG,
16:0/18:1-DG, 18:1/18:1-DG, 18:0/18:0-DG, 18:0/20:4-DG, or 18:0/22:6-DG
for 30 min. The concentrations of the assay components were 2.7 mol
% DG, 0.2 mM ATP, and 13 mol % PS. Data are represented as the means
± SD for triplicate measurements. Statistical significance was
determined by Student’s t test. Data shown
are representative of three separate experiments.

Structural Characterization of the Purified DGKζ
We
also revealed that the DGKζ solution could be concentrated
using a centrifugal filter without any significant loss of the protein.
Using the concentrated DGKζ (0.33 mg/mL (3.1 μm)), we
attempted to understand the secondary structure composition using
circular dichroism spectroscopy from 190 to 250 nm. The circular dichroism
spectrum of DGKζ and following analysis using K2X30 suited in the DICHROWEB platform (http://dichroweb.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/html/home.shtml)31 indicates that DGKζ is well-folded
and contains α-helical (25%) and β-strand (18%) structures
(Figure 5A and Table 2), further demonstrating
that the expression of a full-length DGKζ in the baculovirus-infected
insect cells is suitable for producing a natively folded and active
form of DGKζ. The secondary structure composition of DGKζ
was also assessed using the secondary structure prediction server
self-optimized prediction method with alignment (SOPMA, https://omictools.com/sopma-tool), which predicted the α-helix and β-sheet contents to
be 30 and 18%, respectively (Figure 5B and Table 2). The values obtained from the experimental calculations
and the theoretical predictions were mostly in agreement with each
other.

200 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and 5%
glycerol. The analysis of the circular dichroism spectrum using the
program K2X30 suited in the DICHROWEB platform31 showed the presence of both α-helical
(25%) and β-strand (18%) structures. (B) Theoretical secondary

Discussion
DGKζ is a lipid
kinase that regulates a wide variety of cellular
processes. Particularly, DGKζ has recently attracted much attention
as a novel therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy. However, no
enzymatic or structural information on DGKζ is available, hindering
our understanding of the catalytic mechanism of DGKζ and the
strategy design of a reasonable structure-based drug development.
In the present study, we purified a full-length form of DGKζ
using the baculovirus–insect cell expression system. Moreover,
we revealed its enzymatic and structural properties. In contrast to
DGKζ-FL, the yield of DGKζ-CD was very low (Figure S1).

Using size-exclusion chromatography,
DGKζ-FL eluted in a
relatively sharp peak and remained as a monomer (Figure 1D,E). Such a production of
DGKζ-FL in a soluble and monomeric form using the baculovirus–insect
cell expression system is useful for the preparation of a DGKζ
sample suitable for protein crystallization screening. DGKζ-FL
was eluted at the molecular mass of 125 kDa. This value is larger
than the calculated molecular mass (106 kDa), reflecting a multidomain
architecture of DGKζ where each domain is connected by a flexible
linker (Figure 1A).

Spectral data analysis using the program K2X30 suited in the DICHROWEB platform31 suggested that the secondary structures of DGKζ are comprised
of 25% α-helices and 18% β-strands, which are mostly in
agreement with theoretical predictions (30% α-helices and 18%
β-strands) (Figure 5 and Table 2). When compared with other mammalian DGK isozymes (DGKα and
DGKε), the α-helical content of DGKζ is higher than
that of DGKα (19%27) and lower than
that of DGKε (29%35). The β-strand
content of DGKζ is lower than those of both DGKα (27%27) and DGKε (22%35). DGKζ and DGKα have long regulatory regions in addition
to the catalytic and C1 domains, whereas DGKε contains only
C1 domains and the CD. Theoretical predictions (SOPMA) indicate that
the C1 domains and CDs in DGKζ (C1 domains: 36%; CD: 36% (Figure 5)), DGKα (C1
domains: 22%; CD: 37%), and DGKε (C1 domains: 35%; CD: 32%)
are relatively α-helix-rich. Therefore, the α-helix content
of DGKε is likely to be higher than those of DGKζ and
DGKα. On the other hand, the ankyrin repeat is known to be α-helix-rich.40 DGKζ possesses four ankyrin repeats that
contain 54% α-helices (Figure 5B). The ankyrin repeats would provide a higher α-helix
content in DGKζ compared with DGKα.

Enzymatic characterization
of DGKζ, which was carried out
for the first time, reveals that the Km values to ATP (0.050 mM) and DG (1.49 mol %) (Figure 2 and Table 1) are moderately lower than or comparable to those
obtained using DGKα purified from porcine thymus,34 expressed in COS-7 cells,28,29 expressed in the baculovirus–insect cell expression system,27 and DGKε purified from bovine testis.
Unlike DGKα and DGKε, DGKη has a high affinity for
ATP (Km: 0.05 mM) and DG (Km: 0.14 mol %).37 In addition
to different properties in DGK activities, the 1-MGK and 2-MGK activities
of DGKζ are also different from those of other isozymes. Although
type I (DGKα, β, and γ), II (DGKδ, η,
and κ), and III (DGKε) isozymes have substantial 2-monoacylglycerol
kinase (MGK) activity and the type V (DGKθ) isozyme possesses
1-MGK activity, DGKζ and ι (type IV) have only negligible
1-MGK and 2-MGK activities.41 Therefore,
with regard to enzymatic properties, there are many kinds of DGK isozymes,
suggesting that each DGK isozyme functions in different environments,
which include distinct ATP and DG concentrations.

Deletion of
DGKα or DGKζ in mouse models results in
T cells bearing a hyperresponsive phenotype through the attenuation
of Ras guanyl nucleotide-releasing protein 1 and enhanced T-cell activity
against malignancy.21,22,42,43 Therefore, both DGKα and DGKζ
function as immunosuppressors in T cells. The functional similarities
of DGKα and DGKζ suggest that they coordinate with and
complement each other. Different enzymatic properties between DGKα
and DGKζ would contribute to the cooperative and complementary
actions of these isozymes in T cells.

In summary, the present
study demonstrates that the production
of DGKζ-FL using the baculovirus–insect cell expression
system is a very useful approach to obtain DGKζ preparations
for future functional and structural studies. First, DGKζ was
purified to near homogeneity, and the purified DGKζ was soluble
and monomeric, and was concentrated without any significant loss.
These properties are essential for protein crystallization. Second,
the obtained yield of DGKζ, 0.63 mg per 1 L cell culture, is
sufficient to start crystal screening. Third, the purified DGKζ
is catalytically sufficient. Fourth, the Km values for ATP and DG of DGKζ are different from those obtained
for other DGK isozymes. Therefore, there are many enzymatically distinct
DGK isozymes, suggesting that each DGK isozyme acts under different
circumstances in cells. For example, DGKζ and DGKα, which
act as physiological negative regulators of T-cell activation, are
thought to function cooperatively and complementarily to each other.
The successful purification of DGKζ in the present study permits
detailed analyses of this important enzyme and will advance our understanding
of DGKζ-related diseases and therapies.
