Dinitrobenzenesulfonyl-protected
naphthyl azo pyridine conjugate 1 has been designed and
synthesized. Compound 1 acts as a nongelator in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO)–H2O (1:1, v/v) while its hydroxy
counterpart 2 can form
a nice gel in the same solvent. In the presence of sulfide, compound 1 undergoes rapid sulfonate ester hydrolysis and results in
the formation of azo-naphthol 2 that responds in instant
gelation. Such deprotection was extremely selective to sulfide; other
analytes did not show measurable response. The sensing mechanism has
been established by various spectroscopic techniques. Compound 1 in solution (DMSO–H2O) also shows a selective
response toward sulfide over a series of other anions with a color
change. Preparation of test kit with compound 1 allows
detection of sulfide in solution and vapor states. Such kind of dosimetric
sensing of chemical analytes by improvising the protection/deprotection
of functional groups in gelator structure is rare in the literature,
and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a stimuli-responsive
low-molecular-weight gelator which dosimetrically senses sulfide over
other nucleophilic substrates.

1 Introduction
Over
the last few decades, development of new stimuli-responsive
low-molecular-weight gelators (LMWGs) has gained immense interest
in the area of supramolecular chemistry.1−6 Supramolecular gelators with necessary functional groups form self-aggregation
involving different weak forces such as hydrogen bonding, π-stacking,
hydrophobic, and van der Waals forces.7−14 Modulation of these weak interactions by means of different physical
or chemical inputs (heat, light, redox, pH, ions, etc.) brings phase
changes (gel-to-sol transition or vice versa).1−3,7−9,14−31 Such a phase transition stimulated by different chemical substrates
encourages the development of LMWG-derived sensor devices.8,14−31

In regard to development of molecular sensors for biologically
relevant species, design of reaction-based probes is always beneficial
over fluorogenic or chromogenic probes.32−34 Dosimetric sensing probes
are usually highly specific and selective to a single analyte and
do not experience any interference from other analytes during the
sensing process. However, exploitation of dosimetric approach in developing
analyte-responsive LMWGs is rare in the literature.27−31 Gels of this category draw attention for their operational
simplicity and visual detectability involving no instrumental aids
(advantages of supramolecular gels) with high degree of sensitivity
and specificity (advantages of dosimetric sensing).

During our
ongoing research in developing new dosimetric probes
by exploiting LMWGs for sensing of biologically relevant chemical
analytes,27−31 we previously reported a pyridyl azo-based naphthyl acetate derivative
for sensing and discrimination of hydrazine and perborate in a sol–gel
medium.31 The sensing mechanism relied
on the acetyl deprotection of the naphthol −OH group. In continuation,
we wish to report here another simple architecture 1 for
sulfide sensing utilizing the similar methodology involving a sol–gel
technique (Figure 1). Sensing and detection of sulfide draw attention for its toxicity
and biological relevance. Hydrogen sulfide is usually known for its
bad smell (rotten egg smell). However, it is extensively used in research
laboratory for qualitative detection of metal ions and so forth. It
plays vital roles in many biological processes (in modulating blood
pressure, suppression of oxidative stress, as an antioxidant of reactive
oxygen species, etc.)35,36 and also linked to a number of
diseases (Down’s syndrome, Alzheimer’s disease, liver
cirrhosis, etc.).37−39 Thus, development of sensing probes for sulfide is
worth trying. During the past few decades, many chemical methods such
as colorimetry,40,41 gas chromatography,42 electrochemical analysis,43 and use of fluorescent probes44−46 have been developed
for the detection and quantification of sulfide/H2S. On
the contrary, use of a suitable gelator or a progelator for sensing
and detection of sulfide involving sol–gel methodology is unexplored.

Figure 1 Design
concept and structure of compound 1.

However, different functional segments of compound 1 are highlighted in Figure 1. The naphthalene moiety is likely involved in gelation
through
the π–π stacking between the naphthalene rings,29,31 and the pyridyl moiety is introduced in regulating and interlinking
the molecules through coordination of water molecules.26,31 The naphthol −OH group is protected by dinitrobenzenesulfonyl
(DNBS) moiety. The removal of DNBS by suitable nucleophilic analyte(s)
is expected to influence the gelation properties of 1, which will be beneficial for visual sensing of analyte (either
gel-to-sol transition or vice versa). The presence of azo-linked chromogenic
unit displays optical response upon deprotection reaction.

Interestingly,
compound 1 acts as a progelator in
dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO–H2O (1:1, v/v), and upon
sulfide-stimulated deprotection of naphthol −OH group, it produces
a nice gel. The DNBS protection/deprotection of phenolic −OH
moiety in developing chromofluorogenic sensing probes (usually for
biothiols and sulfide) is reported in the literature.32−34,47−49 However, pursuance
of this dosimetric technique in developing stimuli-responsive supramolecular
gelator is unknown in the literature.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis
Scheme 1 represents the synthetic
route to the synthesis
of compound 1. The azo-naphthol 2 was prepared
according to the reported procedure via diazotization of 3-aminopyridine
and its subsequent coupling with 2-naphthol.31 Sulfonylation of phenolic −OH in 2 in the presence
of NaH in dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) gave the desired compound 1 in an appreciable yield. All the compounds were characterized
by usual spectroscopic techniques.

min; and (iii) 2,4-Dinitrobenzenesulphonyl

2.2 Gelation Study and Chemical Responsiveness
of 1
The gelation ability of 1 was
investigated in various organic and semiaqueous solvents (Table S1). Compound 1 did not form
gel in any of the solvents tested. However, the azo-naphthol 2 produced gels from different solvents that mostly included
semiaqueous compositions (Table S1). Then,
we checked whether the removal of DNBS group in 1 by
a suitable chemical analyte that resulted in intermediate 2 could produce a gel or not. Such type of gelation of progelator 1 could be an elegant approach in developing a naked-eye molecular
sensor.27,31 To demonstrate this, we selected DMSO–H2O (1:1, v/v) as the desired solvent.

The effect of different
analytes on sol-to-gel transformation of 1 is shown in Figure 2. When aqueous solutions
of different analytes (in 1 equiv amount) were separately added to
the DMSO solution of 1, it was only for sulfide ions
(as sodium salt) where a stable gel was obtained after ∼5 min.
Other anions (F–, Cl–, Br–, I–, SH–, AcO–, H2PO4–, HPO42–, S2O32–, BO3–, HSO4–, NO3–, and HSO3–) and various amino acids (l-cysteine, l-glycine, l-valine, and l-alanine) did not bring any phase changes
even after ∼1 h and thereby indicated a weaker interaction
of 1 with these substrates under similar conditions.

Figure 2 Photographs
showing the phase changes of 1 (c =
0.04 M) upon addition of equivalent amount of different
analytes (c = 0.2 M) after 1 h in DMSO–H2O (1:1, v/v) [(a) S2–, (b) Cl–, (c) Br–, (d) I–, (e) AcO–, (f) H2PO4–, (g) HPO42–, (h) S2O32–, (i) HS–, (j) BO3–, (k) HSO4–, (l) F–, (m) NO3–, (n) HSO3–, (o) l-cysteine,
(p) l-glycine, (q) l-valine, and (r) l-alanine.
Cl– and AcO– are used as K-salts,
and other anions are used as Na-salts].

These observations corroborated the high sensitivity and
superior
selectivity of compound 1 toward sulfide over the other
analytes examined. Even nucleophilic analytes such as HS–, BO3–, and l-cysteine remained
inert to such changes. A sulfide ion causes a rapid removal of DNBS
group in progelator 1 to yield in situ azo-naphthol 2 that exhibits gelation.

The sulfide-induced gel of 1 was thermoreversible
in nature as shown in Figure 3a. The minimum concentration of 1 required for
gelation in the presence of 1 equiv amount of sulfide was 15 mg/mL
and the corresponding gel melting temperature was 58 °C. Lowering
of this concentration could not bring gelation even after ∼1
h (in the presence of 1 equiv amount of sulfide ions). The morphology
of the gel as established by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
image revealed the fibrous network (Figure 3b).

Figure 3 (a) Pictorial representation of thermoreversibility
of the sulfide-induced
gel of 1 in DMSO–H2O (1:1, v/v), (b)
SEM image of the sulfide-induced gel, and (c) comparison of normalized
UV–vis spectra of 1 in sol and gel states.

Comparison of normalized UV–vis
spectra of 1 in sol and gel states provides significant
information about the
method of gelation of 1 in the presence of sulfide. In
solution, compound 1 exhibited an absorption band at
370 nm corresponding to naphthalene π–π* transition.
This peak was significantly red-shifted to 430 nm in the gel state
upon treatment with sulfide (Figure 3c). Such a large red-shifted absorption band was possibly
due to extensive charge delocalization in 2 (obtained
from the removal of DNBS group in 1), which resulted
in lowering of π–π* transition energy.31

The proposed desulfonylation reaction
was confirmed by 1H NMR, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR),
and mass spectroscopy analysis.
In 1H NMR study, after addition of sulfide (taken in D2O) to the d6-DMSO solution of 1, the aromatic proton of type Hb underwent a large
upfield chemical shift (from 7.60 to 6.91 ppm) (Figure 4). In addition, the signal for the proton
of −OH (Ha) was found at 15.37 ppm. Such an upfield
chemical shift of naphthyl proton (Hb) and appearance of
−OH (Ha) proton signal was a clear indication of
the removal of DNBS group. Interestingly, the newly appeared proton
signals in the presence of sulfide were matched with the proton signals
of compound 2, which undoubtedly confirmed the in situ
formation of 2 in the medium.

Figure 4 Partial 1H
NMR spectra of 1 (a) in the
absence and (b) presence of 1 equiv amount of sulfide and (c) compound 2. All the spectra were recorded in d6-DMSO containing 4% D2O.

FTIR analysis showed the disappearance of stretching of S=O
bond (1756 cm–1) in sulfonate ester and lowering
of stretching for signal of azo N=N bond (from 1581 to 1527
cm–1) on moving from amorphous state of 1 to the gel state obtained through in situ formation of 2 (Figure 5). These
changes in stretching signals were due to removal of electron-withdrawing
DNBS moiety. In addition, the gel state showed a broad stretching
band at 3418 cm–1, indicating the existence of naphthol
−OH. The liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis
of sulfide-induced gel showed the prominent peak at 250.1 corresponding
to the mass of compound 2 [250.0980 (M + H)+] (Figure S1). All this information unequivocally
corroborated the successful conversion of compound 1 into 2 through desulfonylation of 1 in the presence
of sulfide.

(b) gel state obtained with sulfide.

2.3 Solution-Phase Interaction
Interactions
of 1 with the aforementioned analytes were also investigated
in solution and the outcomes were similar to the observations in the
gel phase study. UV–vis spectral changes of 1 in
DMSO–H2O (1:1, v/v) displayed superior sensitivity
of 1 toward sulfide over any other analytes. In the study,
addition of sulfide caused ratiometric change in the absorption of 1 (Figure 6a). Upon successive addition of sulfide, the absorption band at 370
nm was gradually red-shifted to 425 nm with the appearance of a new
peak at 465 nm.

Figure 6 Change in the absorbance of 1 (c =
2.50 × 10–5 M) upon gradual addition of 4 equiv
amounts of (a) sulfide and (b) different analytes (c = 1.0 × 10–3 M) in DMSO–H2O (1:1, v/v). Inset of (a) refers the color change of 1 in the presence of sulfide (Cl– and AcO– are used as K-salts, and other anions are used as Na-salts).

The absorption peaks at 425 nm
corresponded to naphthalene π–π*
transition. The growth of a new absorption band at 465 nm was attributed
to the cleavage of O–S bond, and the intramolecular charge
transfer from naphtholic-OH/naphtholic-O– to pyridyl
azo motif introduced the color change of the solution from almost
colorless to orange-red. The two peaks at 425 and 465 nm progressively
reached the maxima in the presence of 4 equiv amounts of sulfide and
merged together to give a broad region near 450 nm.

Importantly,
all other analytes were found almost noninterfering.
Very little responses were observed for perborate and l-Cys
(Figure 6b). These
outcomes established high sensitivity of 1 toward sulfide
ions. Such high affinity of 1 for sulfide was due to
a greater nucleophilic character of sulfide compared to biothiol (l-Cys) that readily cleaved the sulfonate ester in solution.
In fluorescence, compound 1 also showed a selective response
to sulfide by introducing substantial quenching of emission. By contrast,
other analytes remained silent in the event (Figure S2).

The rapid desulfonylation of 1 using
sulfide was understood
from the time-dependent absorption spectral changes of 1. In the presence of 4 equiv amounts of sulfide, the reaction was
completed within ∼5 min (Figure 7a). The selectivity of probe 1 toward
sulfide was also investigated by recording absorption spectral changes
of 1 with sulfide in the presence of all other analytes.
The spectral comparisons as shown in Figure 7b,c accounted for negligible interference
of other analytes during sulfide sensing.

Figure 7 (a) Time-dependent absorption
spectra (at 450 nm) of 1 (c = 2.50 ×
10–5 M) upon
addition of 4 equiv amounts of sulfide (c = 1.0 ×
10–3 M) in DMSO–H2O (1:1, v/v);
(b) selectivity of 1 (c = 2.50 ×
10–5 M) upon addition of 4 equiv amounts of sulfide
(c = 1 × 10–3 M) to the solution

Cl–, Br–, I–, AcO–, H2PO4–, HPO42–, S2O32–, HS–, BO3–, HSO4–, NO3–, HSO3–, l-cysteine, l-glycine, l-valine and l-alanine) in 4 equiv amounts
each in DMSO–H2O (1:1, v/v), and (c) the associated
bar plot at 450 nm: (i) 1 with all other analytes except
sulfide and (ii) 1 with all analytes including sulfide
and (iii) 1 with sulfide only.

We also investigated the sensitivity of 1 for
sulfide
in solvents like 1:3 and 1:5 DMSO–H2O (v/v) (Figure 8). Addition of 4
equiv amounts of sulfide also brought similar red-shifted spectral
bands as observed for 1:1 solvent composition, suggesting the functioning
of the probe in a solvent of higher water content.

Figure 8 Change in the absorbance
of 1 (c =
2.50 × 10–5 M) upon gradual addition of equivalent
amount of sulfide in (a) 1:3 DMSO–H2O (v/v) and
(b) 1:5 DMSO–H2O (v/v).

The stoichiometry of 1 with sulfide was determined
to be 1:1 (H/G) in all these solvent compositions as indicated by
Benesi–Hildebrand plots (Figure S3).50 Corresponding detection limits51 for sulfide were also calculated (Figure S4). The detection limit values are comparable
with the reported sulfide sensors (Table S2).

Importantly, the UV–vis spectrum of 1 in the
presence of sulfide in DMSO–H2O (1:1, v/v) was almost
identical to the absorption spectrum of 2, indicating
the successful conversion of 1 into 2 by
sulfide ions. A slight change in the peak positions of absorption
bands was possibly due to the presence of DNBS moiety after deprotection
(Figure 9a).

of normalized UV–vis spectra of 2 and 1 with sulfide in DMSO–H2O (1:1,
v/v) and (b) photograph of the test kits of 1 (c = 2.5 × 10–5 M) for solution- and
gas-phase detection of sulfide.

2.4 Test Kit for Sulfide Detection
Alongside,
for further utility of 1 as a qualitative sulfide detector,
test kit experiment was carried out. The strip was prepared by dipping
the filter paper into the DMSO–H2O solution of 1 and then dried in air. The paper was next dipped into an
aqueous sulfide solution. The color of the strip was changed into
yellowish brown-orange. A similar color change of the strip was noted
when the strip was kept in contact with H2S gas. These
observations established the beneficial use of compound 1 as a suitable qualitative detector of sulfide without any instrumental
aid (Figure 9b).

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, DNBS-protected
naphthyl azo pyridine 1 that acts as sensing probe for
sulfide in a sol–gel medium
has been designed and synthesized. Compound 1 behaves
as a nongelator in DMSO–H2O (1:1, v/v) and on desulfonylation
forms a gel in the same solvent. In the presence of sulfide, compound 1 undergoes rapid removal of DNBS moiety and forms azo-naphthol 2, which produces an instant gel in DMSO–H2O (1:1, v/v). Such gel formation through dosimetric cleavage of sulfonate
ester is extremely selective to sulfide, while all other analytes
taken in the study remained almost noninterfering and thus finds potential
use in selective visual sensing of sulfide. The deprotection reaction
has been established by various spectroscopic techniques. Selectivity
of compound 1 for sulfide is also found in the solution
phase where ratiometric change in absorbance with sulfide introduces
colorimetric response from almost a colorless solution to orange-red.
Preparation of test kits with compound 1 allows the detection
of sulfide in solution and vapor states and suggests its practical
utility in qualitative detection of sulfide. Such kind of dosimetric
sensing of chemical analytes through protection/deprotection of a
functional group in a gelator backbone is less explored in the literature,
and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a stimuli-responsive
LMWG which dosimetrically senses sulfide over a variety of other nucleophilic
substrates (Table S2).

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Methods
All the chemicals
were purchased from Spectrochem and Sigma-Aldrich. All solvents used
in the reaction were purified, dried, and distilled. NMR solvents
were obtained from Aldrich. 1H and 13C NMR spectra
were recorded in a Bruker 400 MHz instrument. FTIR spectra were obtained
from a PerkinElmer L120-00A spectrometer (νmax in
cm–1) using a KBr pellet. Fluorescence and UV–vis
spectra were recorded using a PerkinElmer LS55 spectrofluorimeter
and a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer, respectively. SEM image
was obtained using an EVO LS-10 ZEISS instrument.

4.2 Synthesis
4.2.1 Compound 2
Compound 2 was synthesized according to the
reported procedure.26,31

4.2.2 Compound 1
To the
solution of compound 2 (1.0 g, 4.01 mmol) in dry THF
(20 mL), NaH (0.3 g, 12 mmol) was added and the solution was allowed
to stir for 15 min at room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere.
After that, 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride (1.18 g, 4.40 mmol)
was added to it. The reaction mixture was stirred under reflux for
8 h. After completion of reaction as monitored by thin-layer chromatography,
THF was removed under vacuum and the residual mass was extracted with
CHCl3/CH3OH (2%, v/v) mixture. The organic layer
was washed with NaHCO3 solution (3 × 15 mL) and dried
over anhydrous Na2SO4. Evaporation of the solvent
gave the crude product which, upon purification by column chromatography
over a silica gel using 15% ethyl acetate in petroleum ether, afforded
the desired compound 1 (0.61 g, yield 72%, mp 142 °C). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): δ 8.89 (d, 1H, J = 2 Hz), 8.70 (t, 1H, J = 4 Hz), 8.44–8.42
(m, 1H), 8.35 (d, 1H, J = 2 Hz), 8.25–8.22
(dd, 1H, J1 = 8 Hz, J2 = 2 Hz), 8.03 (t, 2H, J = 8 Hz), 7.99–7.93
(m, 2H), 7.66–7.61 (m, 2H), 7.50 (d, 1H, J = 8 Hz), 7.42–7.40 (m, 1H); 13C NMR (CDCl3, 100 MHz): 152.7, 150.1, 148.6, 147.9, 145.9, 140.7, 139.9,
134.8, 133.2, 130.00, 132.6, 129.4, 128.3, 127.6, 127.5, 126.18, 126.10,
124.4, 123.9, 121.8, 120.0. FTIR (KBr) ν cm–1: 3053, 1756, 1621, 1584, 1563, 1416, 1295, 1253, 1220; m/z: (ES+) calcd, 480.0 (M)+; found, 480.0
(M)+.

4.3 General Procedure for Gelation
Test
The required amount of compound was first taken in pure
organic solvents
(1 mL), slightly warmed to dissolve and then cooled to room temperature
to form a gel. For semiaqueous solvents, the compound was first dissolved
in the organic solvent and then water was added to it. Analyte-responsive
behavior of compound 1 was investigated following the
same method. In that case, all the guest analytes were taken in water.
All the gels were tested via the usual inversion of vial method after
∼15 min of sample preparation. Samples of gel for SEM image
was dried under vacuum and then coated with a thin layer of gold metal.
The gel-to-sol transition temperature (Tg) was determined by the dropping ball method.

4.4 General
Procedures of UV–Vis and Fluorescence
Titrations
A stock solution of compound 1 was
prepared in DMSO–H2O (1:1, v/v) in the concentration
range of 10–5 M. The stock solutions of all the
analytes were prepared in pure water in the concentration range of
10–3 M. The solution of the compound (2 mL) was
taken in a cuvette and different analytes were sequentially added
in different amounts. The analyte-induced changes in the absorbance
and emission of the compound were recorded.

4.4.1 Stoichiometry
of the Interaction50
The Benesi–Hildebrand
plot was
adopted to determine the stoichiometry of interaction using the expression: A0/(A – A0) = [εM/(εM –
εC)](Ka–1Cg–1 + 1), where εM and εC represent the molar extinction coefficients
for the probe and the complex, respectively, at a selected wavelength, A0 denotes the absorbance of free probe at that
specific wavelength, and Cg is the concentration
of the guest analyte. The measured absorbance A0/(A – A0) as a function of inverse of the analyte concentration fits a linear
relationship, indicating a 1:1 stoichiometry of the probe–analyte
complex.

4.5 Calculation of Detection
Limit51
The detection limit was
calculated
from UV–vis titration data. Absorbance of compound 1 was measured five times, and the standard deviation of blank measurement
was determined. To have the slope, absorbance values were plotted
against concentrations of sulfide. The detection limit was calculated
using the equation: detection limit = 3σ/k,
where σ is the standard deviation of blank measurement and k is the slope.
