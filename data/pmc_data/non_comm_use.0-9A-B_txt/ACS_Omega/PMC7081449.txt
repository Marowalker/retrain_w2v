In
this paper, the fractal-like multiexponential (f-mexp) equation
was modified by introducing the fractional fractal exponent to each stage of the adsorption process.
The new equation was used for the analysis of kinetic adsorption of
copper onto treated attapulgite. The modeling results show that the
modified f-mexp equation fits properly the kinetic data in comparison
with the classical and fractal-like kinetic models tested. The effect
of varying the initial concentration of the adsorbate on the kinetic
parameters was analyzed. Artificial neural networks were applied for
the prediction of adsorption efficiency. Outcomes indicate that the
multilayer perceptron neural network can predict the removal of copper
from aqueous solutions more accurately under different experimental
conditions than the single-layer feedforward neural network. Single-site
and multisite occupancy adsorption models were used for the analysis
of experimental adsorption equilibrium data of copper onto treated
attapulgite. The modeling results show that there is no multisite
occupancy effect and that the equilibrium data fit well the Langmuir–Freundlich
isotherm.

1 Introduction
The
treatment of industrial wastewater is one of the essential
aspects of the preservation of water resources. The conventional treatment
methods include ion exchange, membrane separation, adsorption, and
electrochemical process. Among them, adsorption has been one of the
most successfully applied methods owing to its easy operational process
and high efficiency.1

The precise
description of the adsorption process at a solid/solution
interface requires adequate mathematical expressions, for both kinetics
and adsorption equilibrium, in order to determine properly the interaction
mechanism occurring at a sorbent/sorbate system.2

The artificial neural network (ANN) is an attractive
tool for predicting
the sorption phenomenon.3−6 Such a technique allows learning linear and nonlinear
relationships between variables directly from a set of examples based
on no assumptions concerning the nature of the phenomenological mechanisms.3

The adsorption isotherms are equilibrium
equations that describe
how adsorbates interact with the sorbent materials, thus providing
some insights into the sorption mechanism, the surface properties,
and the affinity of the sorbent.7 The Langmuir8 and Freundlich9 isotherms
are usually used to analyze adsorption equilibrium data. These models
are based on the assumption that each molecule of adsorbate occupies
one adsorption site of the surface with no lateral interaction. In
1984, Nitta et al.10 derived an adsorption
isotherm equation from a localized monolayer model in which lateral
interactions are taken into consideration and each adsorbate molecule
may occupy more than one site on a homogeneous surface. Afterward,
the equation was extended to a heterogeneous surface of multisite
occupancy.11 Later on, Ramirez-Pastor et
al.12−15 developed a statistical thermodynamics model to study the adsorption
of linear adsorbates for multisite occupancy on homogeneous surfaces.
Recently, Riccardo et al.16 presented a
new theoretical description of the fractional statistical theory of
adsorption phenomena based on Haldane’s statistics for complex
adsorption systems. More recently, a new distribution for systems
of particles in equilibrium obeying the exclusion of correlated states
was introduced following Haldane’s state counting.17

Knowledge of kinetic features in a solid/solution
system provides
an insight into the possible mechanism of adsorption along with the
reaction pathways.18 Several kinetic models
have been used to predict the adsorption kinetics in solid/solution
interfaces. These models assume that the kinetic constants are time-invariant.
This concept has been unsatisfactory, especially, when the reactants
were spatially constrained by walls or phase boundaries.19 Based on theoretical and phenomenological observations,
Kopelman demonstrated that the reaction rate coefficient is time-dependent
(fractal-like kinetics).19

Recently,
the fractal-like concept has been introduced and used
to analyze adsorption kinetics for both homogeneous and heterogeneous
systems.20−23 In this context, we have proposed some modifications to the fractal-like
multiexponential equation and derived a new equation for kinetics
of adsorption called modified fractal-like multiexponential (modified
f-mexp). The applicability of the new equation was verified for different
concentrations of copper adsorption onto treated attapulgite (TATP).
Afterward, the modeling results were compared to those of classical
and fractal-like kinetic equations. Included in this paper is also
the investigation of the effect of parameters such as pH of the solution,
initial concentration of the solute, and the dose of adsorbent on
the efficiency of copper adsorption on TATP, along with the modeling
analysis of equilibrium data by models for a single-site and multisite
occupancy adsorption and by ANNs.

2 Theoretical
Analysis
2.1 ANN Models
ANNs are computer systems
based on the functioning mechanism of the brain. The architecture
of ANN is composed of an input layer with input parameters, one or
plus hidden layers, and an output layer. The input parameters are
linearly combined into a hidden layer of units where new combinations
are created as final output variables. Knowledge of the number of
network layers, the number of neurons in the layers, and the learning
algorithms and the neuron transfer functions is essential for the
effective design of the architecture of ANN.24 An exhaustive bibliography for neural network models can be found
in refs (25−33).

Figure 1 shows
the structure of the extreme learning machine (ELM) and the radial
basis function (RBF) for the single-layer feedforward neural network
(SLFN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) with one or two hidden layers.
It comprises an input layer with N input vectors,
one or two hidden layers with N̂ or M̂ neurons, and an output layer with one neuron.

Figure 1 Architecture
of SLFN and MLP with one and two hidden layers.

In this work, ANN’s architecture is composed of an input
layer with 3 neurons (pH, adsorbent dose, and initial solute concentration),
a hidden layer with 10 neurons and an output layer with 1 neuron (adsorbed
amount at equilibrium). ELM, RBF, and MLP neural network models were
used to predict the responses corresponding to 120 experimental points.
A three- and four-layer perceptron was investigated by using MATLAB
version R2015a software. The ELM model was analyzed by the same version
of MATLAB software, while the RBF model was tested by using IBM-SPSS
version 20 software. For ELM and RBF models, the data were randomly
segregated into a training data set (75%) and testing data set (25%).
For MLP, data were divided into 50% for the training data set, 25%
for validating data set, and 25% for testing data set. In addition
to that, the Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) and Bayesian regularization
backpropagation (BRB) training algorithms were tested. The MATLAB
code of ELM and MLP models is shown in Supporting Information.

2.2 Adsorption Models
2.2.1 Adsorption equilibrium isotherms
A century ago, Langmuir8 presented an
isotherm equation to study the adsorption for gas-phase processes 1  or 2  where Ke (Pa–1) is the equilibrium constant, qmax (mg
g–1) is the theoretical monolayer
capacity, p (Pa) is the equilibrium pressure, and
θ = q/qmax is the
coverage.

The Langmuir isotherm for gas-phase processes was
used for the analysis of adsorption from solutions by replacing the
pressure term with the solute concentration C. We
obtain the following equation 3  or 4  where C (mg L–1) is the equilibrium solute concentration.

The Freundlich isotherm equation for adsorption from solutions
is given by the expression34 5  where KF is the
Freundlich constant and s is the heterogeneity constant.

Langmuir–Freundlich isotherm which is a derivative of Langmuir
isotherm for energetically heterogeneous solids was successfully applied
for the analysis of adsorption from solutions.23,35,36 It is given by the following equation 6  where KLF and aLF are the Langmuir–Freundlich constants.

The three models assume that each adsorbate species occupies one
adsorption site of the surface with no lateral interaction.

Nita et al.10 modified eq 2 by including multisite-occupancy
adsorption. The multisite Langmuir (MSL) isotherm is proposed as follows 7  where k is the number of
sites.

Later on, Ramirez-Pastor et al.12−15 presented a model of linear adsorbates
(MLA) on homogeneous surfaces, which is based on exact forms for the
thermodynamic functions of linear adsorbates in one dimension and
its generalization to higher dimensions. The resulting equation is
proposed as follows 8  

In the limiting case k = 1, the MLA and MSL models
reduce to the Langmuir isotherm (eq 2).

Equations 7 and 8 can be used to analyze
adsorption from solutions
by replacing the pressure term with the solute concentration. One
obtains the equations in the following forms 9   10  

2.2.2 Classical and Fractal-Like Kinetic Models
The theoretical
backgrounds of classical kinetic models of pseudo-first-order
(PFO), pseudo-second-order (PSO), mixed-1,2 order (MO), and multiexponential
(mexp) can be found in refs (37−40).

The fractal-like approach
allows the description of the adsorption behaviors at the solid/solution
interface occurring in fractal spaces. The rate coefficient with temporal
“memories” is presented as19 11  where kf is the
instantaneous rate coefficient, k′ is the
time-independent rate coefficient, and h is the fractal
exponent, measuring the dimensionality of the fractal system.41

In 2012, Haerifar and Azizian introduced
the time dependency of
the adsorption rate coefficient to the PFO, PSO, and mixed-1,2 order
equations.21 Recently, we have introduced
this concept to the multiexponential equation.23

Table 1 lists the
classical and fractal-like kinetic equations.

a k1 (min–1) and k2 (g mg–1 min–1) are the PFO and PSO kinetic constants. k1′ (min–(1–h)) and k2′ (g mg–1 min–(1–h)) are the kinetic constants of the fractal-like PFO and PSO
models. F = qt/q is the adsorption progress and  is the parameter determining the
“share”
of the second-order term, n is the number of exponential
terms, and ki and ki′ are the kinetic constants of the i-th process for the mexp and f-mexp equations. fi (i = 1,
2, ..., n), where ∑i=1nfi = 1, are the parameters of
the mexp and f-mexp models.

The fractal-like multiexponential kinetic equation can be considered
as a series of parallel fractal-like first-order equations, where
each kinetic process “i” is characterized
by its fractal instantaneous rate coefficient kfi 12  

In this case, the fractal exponent h is the same
for all processes. It should be emphasized, however, that each process
is governed by its adsorption stage (fast, slow...).39 In order to take into consideration the fractal behavior
in various stages of the adsorption, we introduced the fractional
fractal exponent to each stage of the process. Based on the Kopelman
fractal-like kinetics concept19 applied
to each process “i”, the instantaneous
rate coefficient can be written as 13  where hi is the fractional fractal
exponent of i-th
process.

By inserting eq 13 into the multiexponential rate equation (see Table 1), one obtains the modified
fractal-like
multiexponential rate equation 14  

The integrated
form of eq 14 is 15  or 16  when hi = 0, the rate equation of the modified f-mexp reduces to the
classical model. The MATLAB code of the modified f-mexp is shown in Supporting Information.

2.3 Model Performance Indicators
The
parameters of equilibrium, kinetic, and neural network studies were
estimated using a nonlinear regression method provided by MATLAB R2017b
software. The comparison between the performances of the models was
evaluated based on the statistical parameters such as the chi-squared
error (χ2) and the determination coefficient (R2). Their mathematical expressions are23,42 17   18  where qexp and qcal (mg g–1) are the experimental
and calculated adsorbed amount, respectively, whereas q̅cal (mg g–1) refers to the average
of the calculated adsorbed amount.

3 Results
and Discussion
Figure 2 shows the
quantity of the surface charge of ATP and TATP versus pH for three
ionic strengths. The three curves are identical and intersect at the
same point. This result confirms that the surface charge is independent
of ionic strength. The increase in pH leads to the increment in the
negative charge of the quantity of the surface charge. From the curves,
the average value of the point of zero charge (PZC) is 9.15 for ATP,
while it is 4 for TATP. The high value of PZC of ATP is ascribed to
the presence of carbonate groups such as calcite and dolomite (see
the X-ray diffractograms of ATP and TATP presented in Figure S1 in Supporting Information). Indeed, the PZC values
of calcite vary from 8 to 10.8.43 The acid
treatment of ATP causes a shift in the PZC from 9.15 to 4. This high
shift is mainly due to the elimination of calcite and dolomite. Similar
findings were reported by Frini-Srasra and Srasra.44

Figure 2 Variation of QH with pH at different
ionic strengths for ATP (right) and TATP (left).

Table 2 lists the
fitting values of error functions for single-layer feedforward (ELM
and RBF) and MLP (MLP-LM and MLP-BRB) neural networks models. The
effect of the number of hidden layers on the predictive performance
was examined, and the results are also presented in Table 2. Outcomes indicate that the
increase in the number of hidden layers leads to a slight improvement
in the fitting results. Also from Table 2, it can be seen that the MLP models can
predict the removal efficiency of copper from aqueous solutions more
accurately than the SLFN models. Moreover, the MLP model with BRB
resulted in a slightly better performance. It should be emphasized,
however, that the MLP-LM model requires only 20 iterations, while
the MLP-BRB requires 1000 iterations, which may suggest that the MLP-LM
model is more effective in terms of reducing the response time.

Figure 3 illustrates
the predicted values of the adsorbed amount as a function of initial
copper concentration at different pHs and adsorbent doses based on
the MLP-BRB neural network model. Outcomes indicate that the amount
of adsorption per unit mass of the adsorbent increases by increasing
the solution pH or the initial concentration of solute. At lower pH
values, the adsorption of copper may be hindered by two effects: (1)
the hydrogen ion concentration was high and the positively charged
hydrogen might compete for the binding sites on the surfaces of TATP.
(2) Copper ions can form complexes with the excess of chloride ions
produced by the addition of HCl when adjusting the solution pH.45,46 The increase in the pH value leads to the increment in the adsorption
of metal ions. In fact, the copper adsorption depends upon the mixed
effect of sorbing species and the surface properties of TATP. Taking
into consideration the PZC value of TATP (PZC = 4), at pH value lower
than this value, the surface of TATP is positively charged leading
to electrostatic repulsion between the sorbent and the metal cations.
Thus, the adsorption could possibly take place through nonelectrostatic
interaction.46 For pH > PZC, the TATP
surface
is negatively charged resulting in the rise in the degree of adsorption
preferably occurring by electrostatic interaction.46

Figure 3 Adsorption profiles of copper onto TATP at various pHs, initial
concentrations of solute, and adsorbent doses. Comparison between
experimental data (symbols) and by fitting with the MLP-BRB (dashed
lines) neural network model.

On the other hand, the mass transfer driving force increases as
the initial concentration of the solute increases, and accordingly,
the adsorption rate of copper on TATP becomes faster.47

The rise in the adsorbent dose leads to a decrease
in adsorption
efficiency. This is mainly due to the unsaturation of adsorption sites
and the aggregation of TATP particles, which would cause a decrease
in the total surface area and an increment in the diffusional path.48

Equations 4–6, 9 and 10 were used for modeling the adsorption
equilibrium of TATP-Cu. Table 3 lists the obtained
fitting results. Outcomes indicate that there is no multisite occupancy
effect (k = 1). This could be ascribed to the small
size of the adsorbate in comparison with those of polyatomic adsorbates
used in various studies from the literature.10,49 The theoretical models MSL and MLA have provided the same fitting
results and are identical to those of the Langmuir model. On the other
hand, the equilibrium adsorption data are well interpreted by the
Langmuir–Freundlich isotherm, thus suggesting an energetically
heterogeneous surface for the TATP; therefore, the fractal-like kinetic
models could be used to analyze kinetic data of adsorption of copper
onto TATP.22

PFO,
PSO, mixed-1,2 order, and multiexponential equations and their
fractal counterparts have been used to describe the kinetic adsorption
of TATP-Cu at different initial concentrations of the adsorbate. The
values of the calculated parameters of mexp, f-mexp, and modified
f-mexp models are listed in Table 4. Tables S1–S3 show
the obtained fitting results of PFO, PSO, MO, f-PFO, f-PSO, and f-MO
kinetic models. Outcomes indicate that the increase in the initial
concentration of the adsorbate leads to the increment in the kinetic
rate coefficients and the fractal exponents. The rise in the fractal
behavior with the initial concentration of the solute could be ascribed
to the increase in the fractal adsorption. These results are consistent
with those reported in the literature for other adsorption kinetic
systems.21−23 Also from Table 4, it can be seen that the fractional fractal exponent
is larger for the fast step than that of the slow one. Moreover, the
comparison between the fitting parameters (ki′, fi) of the f-mexp
model and that of the modified one indicates that the fast and slow
steps were significantly differentiated by introducing the fractional
fractal exponent to each stage of the adsorption process. On the other
hand, the kinetic half-times were reduced with an increase in the
initial concentration of the adsorbate. In fact, the rise in the initial
concentration of the solute results in an increment in the adsorption
rate, thereby decreasing in the kinetic half-time. Similar observations
were reported by El Boundati et al.23

Furthermore, the fractional adsorption half-times, t1/2,i, were calculated for
mexp, f-mexp,
and modified f-mexp equations and are listed in Table 4. The results indicate that the fractional
adsorption half-times for the fast steps are much shorter than those
of the slow stages (<1 min). It should be emphasized, however,
that the calculated t1/2,i values from the f-mexp equation do not show significant differences
between the fast and slow stages. This could be ascribed to the fact
that the kinetic parameters (ki′ and fi) were fitted by assuming
a global fractal exponent h for the f-mexp equation (see Table 4). Thus, the fast
and slow steps were not differentiated.

Also, from Tables 4 and S1–S3, we can conclude that
each fractal-like kinetic model gives a better adsorption prediction
when compared to its classical formulation as confirmed by the highest R2 value and the lowest χ2 value. Figure 4 represents the averages
of standard deviations (SDs) of the difference between experimental
and calculated adsorbed amounts, Δqt (Δqt = qt,exp – qt,cal), from the classical
and fractal-like kinetic equations. The results and the plot of Figure 4 show that the modified
f-mexp equation is the best one for the analysis of experimental data
of copper adsorption on TATP.

for
adsorption of copper onto TATP.

The time evolution of the instantaneous adsorption rate coefficient kfi of the modified
f-mexp model, obtained by applying eqs 13 and 16 for the TATP-Cu system,
has been plotted in Figure 5. Figure S2 depicts the variation
of kf with the time of
the f-mexp, f-MO, f-PSO, and f-PFO models for the adsorption of copper
onto TATP. The plots of figures clearly show that kf is not a constant parameter and it
decreases as the time increases. This time dependency means that the
history of the process can affect the rate coefficient of adsorption.19,22 The decrease in the instantaneous rate coefficient with time could
also be explained by considering the equilibrium studies. It was found
that the TATP surface is heterogeneous; hence, bypassing time, the
probability of adsorption on sites with a lower value of the rate
constant is increased.22 Also, it should
be noted that the instantaneous rate coefficients of the fast steps
(kf1) decrease
faster with time for different initial concentrations of the solute
than those of the slow ones (kf2) because the corresponding fractional fractal
exponent values were much higher in comparison with those of the slow
stages (see Table 4).

adsorption of copper onto TATP.

The predictive performance of the modified f-mexp equation has
been tested for the modeling of adsorption kinetics of four experimental
systems.50−53 The results are evaluated based on the mathematical error functions R2 and χ2. The obtained values
of the fitting error functions are listed in Table 5. Figure 6 depicts the results of kinetic modeling by applying
the modified f-mexp equation. Outcomes indicate that the modified
f-mexp equation can fit the experimental data very well over the whole
adsorption range.

4 Conclusions
The main purpose of this work was to better understand the fractal
adsorption kinetics process stages and provide useful information
for the interaction mechanism occurring at a solid/solution interface.
To this end, we introduced some modifications to the fractal-like
multiexponential kinetic equation to take into consideration the fractal
behavior for each step of the adsorption process. The applicability
of the new equation was verified for the adsorption kinetics of copper
onto TATP. The modeling results show a high accuracy between theoretical
and experimental data in the whole time range.

The comparison
between the fitting results of the new model and
those of classical and fractal-like kinetics models indicates that
the modified fractal-like multiexponential equation is the best one
to describe experimental data of adsorption kinetics for TATP-Cu over
the whole adsorption range. The kinetic parameters were affected by
the change of adsorbate concentration. Furthermore, the fractal-like
adsorption behavior and the kinetic constants were much higher for
the fast steps of adsorption in comparison with those of the slow
ones.

We also concluded from the modeling analysis of adsorption
equilibrium
data of copper onto TATP that there is no multisite occupancy effect
and that the equilibrium data fit well the Langmuir–Freundlich
isotherm, thus reflecting an energetically heterogeneous surface for
the TATP.

Moreover, the influence of various parameters such
as the adsorbent
dose, the solution pH, and the initial solute concentration was studied
based on the process simulation by ANNs. The results indicated that
the MLP network can better simulate equilibrium data under various
experimental conditions with respect to the SLFN.

5 Experimental Section
5.1 Adsorbent and Adsorbate
The attapulgite
(ATP) samples were obtained from the north of Morocco. The samples
were ground by mortar and treated with hydrochloric acid (analytical
reagent grade, Sigma-Aldrich) 37% at a concentration of 3 mol L–1 for 12 h. The TATP was thoroughly washed with bidistilled
water to remove all acid and filtered. The resulting material was
termed TATP and used in the adsorption experiments. TATP was dried
in the oven at 373 K for 12 h and then sieved to obtain particles
smaller than 63 μm. This particle size range was selected based
on the results of the particle size effect on copper adsorption onto
TATP (Figure S3). The aqueous solutions
of the adsorbate were prepared by dissolving the desired amount of
copper salt (CuSO4·5H2O) (analytical reagent
grade, Riedel-de Haën) in redistilled water.

5.2 Potentiometric Titration and Adsorption Experiments
Potentiometric titration was used to evaluate the acid–base
nature of the surface properties of ATP and TATP. The ATP or TATP
sample (0.5 g) was mixed with 50 mL of NaCl (Carlo Erba Reagents)
at various ionic strengths (I = 0.01–0.1 mol
L–1). The mixture was acidified by 0.1 M of HCl
and then titrated by 0.1 M of NaOH (analytical reagent grade, Fluka).
Based on the titration curves pH = f(VNaOH), the quantity of the surface charge QH (mol g–1) and the PZC were determined.

Adsorption equilibrium experiments were carried out at room temperature
by using a batch technique. An amount of TATP was mixed with 25 mL
of 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, and 400 mg L–1 of copper
solutions. The mixture was agitated for 4 h to assure the adsorption
equilibrium. The contact time was chosen based on preliminary kinetic
tests as largely sufficient to achieve equilibrium conditions (Figure S4). The centrifugation technique was
used to separate the solid, and the residual copper concentration
was analyzed through atomic absorption spectrophotometry using a spectrophotometer
(Jobin Yvon 2). The adsorbent dose effect was conducted by varying
the TATP amount from 2 to 12 mg L–1. The effect
of pH on the copper adsorption process was investigated in the pH
range of 1–5 by adding an appropriate amount of HCl (0.1 M)
or NaOH (0.1 M) solutions. The adsorption kinetic experiments were
conducted, as in the equilibrium studies, by contacting 8 g L–1 of TATP with 25 mL of adsorbate at concentrations
ranging from 150 to 400 mg L–1, at time intervals
varying from 5 to 300 min.

The adsorption capacity of the adsorbent
is obtained by the following
equation23 19  where qt (mg g–1) is the adsorbed amount at the time t, Ci and Ct (mg L–1) are the
solute concentrations in the bulk solution initially and at the time t, respectively, and d (g L–1) is the adsorbent dose.

The kinetic half-time, t1/2, is the
time necessary to adsorb half of the equilibrium quantity (q).54 It is computed by fixing
the adsorption fraction, qt/q, to one-half.
