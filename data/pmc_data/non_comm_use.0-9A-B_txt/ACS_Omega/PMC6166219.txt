The fidelity of protein
synthesis is largely dominated by the accurate
recognition of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) by their cognate aminoacyl-tRNA
synthetases. Aminoacylation of each tRNA with its cognate amino acid
is necessary to maintain the accuracy of genetic code input. Aminoacylated
tRNAMet functions in both initiation and elongation steps
during protein synthesis. As a precursor to the investigation of a
methionyl-tRNA synthetase–tRNAMet complex, presented
here are the results of molecular dynamics (MD) for single nucleotide
substitutions in the D-loop of tRNAMet (G15A, G18A, and
G19A) probing structure/function relationships. The core of tRNAMet likely mediates an effective communication between the
tRNA anticodon and acceptor ends, contributing an acceptor stem rearrangement
to fit into the enzyme-active site. Simulations of Escherichia coli tRNAMet were performed
for 1 μs four times each. The MD simulations showed changes
in tRNA flexibility and long-range communication most prominently
in the G18A variant. The results indicate that the overall tertiary
structure of tRNAMet remains unchanged with these substitutions;
yet, there are perturbations to the secondary structure. Network-based
analysis of the hydrogen bond structure and correlated motion indicates
that the secondary structure elements of the tRNA are highly intraconnected,
but loosely interconnected. Specific nucleotides, including U8 and
G22, stabilize the mutated structures and are candidates for substitution
in future studies.

Introduction
Transfer RNA (tRNA)
is the adaptor molecule proposed originally
by Francis Crick to connect the nucleic acid information with the
polypeptide output.1 tRNAs are stable noncoding
RNA molecules approximately 76 nucleotides long that enable translation
of an mRNA to the corresponding polypeptide according to the genetic
code.2 They form a conserved cloverleaf
secondary structure (e.g., Supporting Information Figure S1), and more importantly, the tRNA helices coaxially stack
to form a distinct L-shape tertiary structure (Figure 1). There are 20 canonical tRNA families that
are recognized by their cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARSs)
for the synthesis of aminoacyl-tRNA. Most AARSs recognize one or more
tRNA anticodon (AC) nucleotides [in addition to the nucleotides in
the acceptor stem (AS)] as specificity determinants, and allostery
likely occurs to properly position the tRNA 3′-end in the enzyme
catalytic site (Figure 1).1,3

Figure 1 Tertiary structure of E. coli tRNAMet. The structure was built from the A. aeolicus tRNAMet structure (PDB 2CSX) and the E. coli tRNACys structure (PDB 1U0B). The colors correspond
to the secondary
structure elements as shown. The mutated residues G15 (red), G18 (green),
and G19 (blue) are highlighted for clarity.

Methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS) aminoacylates tRNAMet for efficient decoding at both the translational start
and within
a message.4,5 Aminoacylation of tRNAMet occurs
in two catalytic steps. First, MetRS binds ATP and methionine in its
active site to catalyze the formation of the methionyl adenylate (Met-AMP)
intermediate. In the second step, the activated amino acid is transferred
to the ribose 2′-hydroxyl group on the tRNA 3′-terminal
adenosine in an esterification reaction.6 The AC stem of tRNAMet is thought to first interact with
MetRS at its AC-binding domain, approximately 50 Å away from
the enzyme’s active site.6,7 The AS of tRNAMet is presumed to undergo a conformational change to fit into the MetRS
active site, although the capture of such a structure by X-ray crystallography
has proved elusive.8,9 The transiently unwound 3′-end
is likely short-lived and not thermodynamically stable, which makes
structural characterization difficult.9 A 105-fold decrease in kcat/KM occurs when Trp-461, in the MetRS
AC-binding domain, is mutated to alanine, indicating that the AC is
a strong identity element for MetRS.4 It
is thought that tRNA signal transfer occurs, at least in part, through
core nucleotides for an efficient aminoacylation to take place, although
little is known about the pathway through which this signaling occurs,10 that is, it is unknown which particular nucleotides
within the tRNAMet are important for a long-range communication
between the AC binding and catalytic sites, although the nucleotides
in the tRNA core may well mediate this communication. To examine this
hypothesis, substitutions were made to the conserved D-loop nucleotides
that contribute to the core stability but not the Watson–Crick
hydrogen bonding in helical regions.

Variants discussed herein
are the guanine-to-adenine single-nucleotide
substitutions in the Escherichia coli tRNAMet D-loop at the conserved positions 15, 18, and
19 (Figure 1), with
the base numbering according to the tRNAdb.11 The E. coli tRNAMet G15:C48
base pair has a reverse Watson–Crick hydrogen bonding, known
as a Levitt pair.12 The G15:C48 pair is
the so-called Levitt pair, which has a reverse Watson–Crick
geometry and is stabilized by Mg2+ binding.6,12 The GG motif in the D-loop is evolutionarily conserved; the hydrogen
bonding between the G18:U55 and G19:C56 pairs contributes to the tertiary
structure in the tRNA core.13 The importance
of these nucleotides in the long-range communication has not been
explicitly investigated. In this work, we targeted these conserved
bases for computational analysis because they are not in helical (secondary
structure) regions but instead are part of the tRNA core (tertiary
structure). This work will set the stage for the experimental and
computational analysis of the tRNA in complex with its cognate methionyl-tRNA
synthetase.

An atomic comparison of the substitutions is shown
in Figure 2. The G15A
variant
disrupts the normal reverse Watson–Crick hydrogen base pairs,
and part a of Figure 2 shows a rearrangement of the nucleotide, C48, to accommodate the
flipped amide group between guanine and adenine. In the middle pane,
the wild type (WT) G18:U55 pair is shown next to A18:U55, and where
the WT can form multiple hydrogen bonds with the oxygen atom of Uracil,
the variant can form only one. In the bottom pane showing the WT compared
to G19A, adenosine has bent away from the C56 base pair, leaving a
5 Å gap between the nearest atoms across the pair.

Figure 2 Comparison
of nucleotide substitutions to WT. Each of the three
panels compares the base pair of the WT nucleotide to that of the
substitution. In panel (a), the G15 WT is shown above the A15A variant;
in panel (b), the G18 of WT is shown above the A18 variant; and in
panel (c), the G19 of WT is shown above the A19 variant. Each image
was taken from the energy-minimized starting structure.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were employed
to model E. coli tRNAMet in silico with single
nucleotide substitutions in the core. Subsequent analyses were used
to identify the changes in the tRNAMet structure and flexibility
as a result of these substitutions. The simulations showed the the
tRNA core variants display changes in long-range communication and
flexibility, while maintaining the overall tertiary structure. The
altered hydrogen-bonding patterns observed upon base substitutions
suggest other nucleotides that may operate as hubs for communication
within the tRNA core. The comparisons of hydrogen bond networks (which
highlight structurally critical bases) to the network analysis of
correlation matrices (which highlight dynamically critical bases)
expose the likely modes for structure/function relationships.

Results
G18A Variant
Shows Largest Core Fluctuations
RMSF is
the root-mean-square fluctuation at each C1′ atom from a time-averaged
structure throughout a trajectory and is the primary measure of biomolecule
flexibility. An increase in flexibility was expected in the tRNA loops
and at the AS compared to the helical regions based on previous MD
studies of yeast tRNAMet and E. coli tRNAPhe.14,15 This was also observed for the
WT tRNAMet (Figure 3).

Figure 3 RMSFs of tRNAMet. The major secondary structure elements
are labeled across the top and colored according to the cloverleaf
structure to the right, with the highlighted bases colored according
to the substitution. The WT fluctuations are shown in black, G15A
in red, G18A in green, and G19A in blue. The secondary structure regions
include the AS, the D-loop (D), the AC, the variable-loop (V), and
the TψC-loop, which are color-coded per the legend above the
plot.

In Figure 3, the
G18A variant shows the largest deviation from the WT fluctuations,
particularly in the D-loop and the TψC-loop. RMSF of the G18A
variant increases to over 10 Å in the D-loop at the point of
substitution, whereas all other RMSFs decrease to less than 5 Å
at the 18th nucleotide. Compared to the other tRNAs previously studied,
an increase to 10 Å is a significant increase.14,15 From residues 17–20, the G18A substitution directly affects
the local environment, where the other two variants more closely resemble
that of the WT tRNA. In the AC region, all four configurations have
a peak centered about the CAU AC, although G19A exhibits a less AC
fluctuation. In the TψC-loop, two variants (namely G15A and
G18A) display increased fluctuations at the 58th residue; yet, the
magnitude of the G18A increase is double that of WT.

Conformational
Clustering Highlights Stability of G19A
Quality threshold
(QT) clustering was used to identify the most conformationally
similar structures, as well as to determine the extent to which the
tRNA variants access overlapping sets of conformations. By concatenating
all the trajectories together and clustering on a common set of atoms,
one can readily compare the structural similarities and differences
for the four different variants. The minimum cluster diameter was
found by minimizing the number of unclustered frames when scanning
over the trajectories in 0.1 Å increments.

The clusters
in Figure 4 represent
the dominant conformations for the backbone atoms of all 16 μs
(4 variants times 4 μs each) concatenated together as well as
their distribution within each of the first 40 clusters, comprising
80.9% of the simulation frames. For each structural image, with the
exception of G18A, the median-colored structure is surrounded by a
superposition of partly transparent conformations within 1σ
of the distribution. Because G18A (green) conformations occur most
frequently in the first cluster, the median structure of which belongs
to the G19A simulations, the colored conformation is the first conformation
in cluster 1 of the G18A simulations.

Figure 4 QT clustering. The combined clustering
uses a distance cutoff of
4.3 Å. The structures of the largest population and its distribution
are highlighted (coloring consistent with Figure 3). The G19A variant provides the largest
contribution to the most populated cluster at 67%. The G18A variant
is also represented most frequently in the first cluster, with the
G15A in the third cluster, and WT in the fifth.

The G19A variant dominates the most populated cluster, contributing
67.5% of the frames to the first cluster and encompassing more than
76% of the G19A (4 μs) trajectory space. The AC of cluster 1
has a large shaded region, indicating the positional variability of
that region. The WT configuration contributes the fewest frames to
the dominant cluster and is distributed primarily across the clusters
5, 6, 7, and 9. It maintains the helical portion of the AS and a distinct
D-loop (on the left of the cluster conformations), and there is a
small loop just after the AC base sequence. Additionally, the WT TψC-loop
shows a distinct conformation compared to each of the three variants
at the top left of the black cluster (Figure 4). The G15A variant is most populated in
cluster 3 and reveals a clear distortion near U8 in the inside fold
of the L-shaped structure.

This clustering analysis reveals
both that the tertiary structure
is maintained in all simulations and that the single-stranded AS bases
74–76 and the AC regions are highly flexible (Figure 3).

Clustering of each
independent 4 μs trajectory was also performed.
Shown in Supporting Information Figure
S4 are the WT tRNA conformation samples the first four clusters, often
with 18% in the first cluster and 58% of conformations in the first
four clusters combined. The dominant G19A conformation persists in
51% of the simulations, making it the most stable of the individually
clustered configurations. Outside of the first 10 clusters, no conformation
has more than 2% of the frames in a single cluster, indicating the
high diversity of conformational sampling for the tRNA variants.

Hydrogen Bond Networks Highlight Important Secondary Structure
Domains
The hydrogen bonds between Watson–Crick and
wobble base pairs define the tRNA cloverleaf secondary structure.
The hydrogen bonds most persistent throughout the simulations provide
insight into which particular bonds are most important in stabilizing
the canonical structure. Examining each variant and WT separately,
persistent hydrogen bonds (e.g., those included in Figure 5) are those with the donor–acceptor
pair distance less than 3.2 Å and with the donor–hydrogen–acceptor
angles greater than 120° and present during 50% of the trajectory.
The hydrogen bond network diagrams were made to facilitate visualizing
nucleotide connectivity (Figure 5). The multiple edges between the nodes indicate that
there are multiple donor–acceptor pair combinations between
those two residues. This could include the same donor atom coordinating
with two different acceptors (bifurcated hydrogen bond) or two completely
different donor–acceptor pairs. In Figure 5, one can readily identify the bonds that
support the cloverleaf structure commonly shown in the stems of 2D
representations, as the nodes are colored by the secondary structure
domain, consistent with Figure 1. Within the TψC-loop and the D-loop, which combine
to constitute the elbow of the tRNA, WT, G15A, and G19A have more
persistent hydrogen bonds than does G18A. Specifically, nucleotide
18 no longer forms hydrogen bonds with U56 as a result of the G18A
substitutions, whereas a G18:U56 pair exists in the other three configurations,
as shown (green triangles) in Figure 5 (additional union and intersection hydrogen bond networks
are available in Supporting Information Figure S5). Similarly, there were no persistent hydrogen bonds with
G15A for its single nucleotide substitution. The G15:C48 Levitt pair
is revealed as dynamic in the WT tRNAMet, as it is not
present at the >50% threshold despite its persistence in the G18A
and G19A variants. As Mg2+ was absent in these simulations,
this result is consistent with the experimental results, indicating
the Levitt pair is stabilized by that ion.6 Specifically, in the WT simulations, the complete Levitt pair (both
hydrogen bonds present) for G15:C48 was only present 17.7% of the
time. Only in the WT configuration were there hydrogen bonds with
the G19 nucleotide, suggesting that it is more susceptible to small
perturbations than the G18 nucleotide, for example.

Figure 5 Hydrogen bond networks
of tRNAMet variants across 4
μs of simulation. Clockwise from the top left are WT, G15A,
G19A, and G18A. Each directed edge (from donor to acceptor) represents
a bond present in more than 50% of the simulations. The edges are
weighted by percent occupancy, where the thicker lines represent more
persistent bonds. The node shape indicates the particular nucleotides,
where diamonds represent adenine, circles cytosine, triangles guanine,
and arrows uracil. The nodes are colored consistent with Figures 1 and 3, except in the case of variants, which are colored red(G15),
green (G18), and blue (G19).

Although each set of simulations (WT and three variants)
has a
unique network of bonds, there is an overlap between them (Supporting Information Figure S5). In WT, the
largest group consists of 11 nodes. In particular, residue G22 connects
this large group together with the backbone hydrogen bonds. The G22–A23
bond appears in each configuration of Figure 5 as a single donor–acceptor pair that
connects two different groups, ultimately forming the largest network
in both the union and intersection depictions of Figure S5. In addition
to the backbone bonds, there are two additional bonds of potential
importance with G22, those with C13 and G46, as they establish key
stacking interactions in the core.

Correlation Networks Show
Long- and Short-Range Relationships
Correlated motion analysis
highlights the nucleotides (and atoms
therein) that have common movements capable of propagating an allosteric
signal. The correlated motions of the WT tRNAMet show distinct
signatures, including long-range correlations connecting different
parts of the tRNA.

First, looking at the short-range WT tRNAMet correlations (boxes along the diagonal of the WT portion
of Figure 6), it is
clear that the D-loop and TψC-loop are each well-coordinated
with themselves, as shown in the two boxed regions of the WT portion
of Figure 6, consistent
with the hydrogen bond results in Figure 5. These strong signals in the core domains
persist in all the substitutions, but are weakest in the G18A variant.
There is a correlation signal present in all configurations that propagates
perpendicularly from the backbone signature in the AC. An anticorrelation
between the AC and the D-loop is present in all configurations, with
the most significant perturbations again occurring in the G18A variant,
most clearly seen in Figure 6.

Figure 6 All-atom correlated motions of the WT tRNA and each variant. Clockwise
from top left are WT, G15A, G19A, and G18A. The G18A mutation shows
the most drastic changes, switching to an anticorrelation between
the D-loop and the TψC-loop, highlighted by circles. The squares
highlight the regions of locally strong correlation patterns.

Moving toward longer-range correlations,
the variable region (black)
shows long-range correlations across the AS, D-loop, and AC, highlighted
by a box in G15A of Figure 6. An additional region of long-range anticorrelation appears
in all configurations between the AS and the D-loop that most clearly
show up in the results of Figure 7, which shows correlated motions greater than |Cij| ≥ 0.5, physically
connected with the cylinders to highlight the long-range interactions.

Figure 7 Correlation
network of tRNAMet projected onto structures.
The connections of the most strongly (anti)correlated motions between
C1′ are shown projected onto the structures. The positively
correlated motions are colored red and negatively correlated motions
are blue. The atom pairs are connected only if the correlations satisfy
|Cij| ≥ 0.5.

The most drastic change in correlation
signatures is apparent on
comparing the G18A variant and WT between the D-loop and the TψC-loop.
In the WT tRNAMet, there exists a small highly correlated
pocket (circled in Figure 6); yet, in the G18A substitution, a large pocket of anticorrelated
motion is surrounded by a circle of correlated motion in this region.
This unique signature shows again that the G18A variant deviates the
most from WT and suggests that this is the variant most capable of
disrupting the normal regulatory function.

Figure 8 shows a
network of the correlated motions to highlight the dynamical similarities
and variations. The edges are represented in the red and blue cylinders
of Figure 7. To quantify
the important components of the network, we calculated the betweenness
and closeness centrality of the network nodes (bases), as shown in Figures 8 through 11. Betweenness is a network centrality measure based
on the shortest paths between each pair of nodes, where a larger betweenness
means there are more shortest paths through a particular node. Closeness,
on the other hand, uses the shortest paths to determine how near each
node is to all other nodes. Here, the WT correlation network largely
separates the secondary structural elements, but groups G18 far from
its own secondary structure with the TψC-loop (Figure 8). In the WT configuration,
G44 shows the largest betweenness centrality (0.3) by more than double
that of the other residues (Figure 8). U8 has the highest degree (count node edges) for
the WT configuration. A number of D-loop nodes have high closeness
values and are centrally located in the spring-embedded layout. G19
did not meet the criteria to appear on the WT correlation network,
whereas G18 and G15 did, but have relatively low betweenness and closeness
values.

Figure 8 WT correlation network analysis. The correlation networks show
each node color-coded by the tRNA secondary structure or variant consistent
with the previous figures. The nodes are connected when the correlations
satisfy |Cij| ≥
0.5. The betweenness and closeness plots as a function of the number
of neighbors highlight whether a nucleotide is important to regulating
dynamic allostery. In each plot, the points are colored by secondary
structure, and the size is determined by the number of hydrogen bonds
corresponding to that node, where a larger diameter indicates more
hydrogen bonds. Select bases are labeled by their corresponding data
points.

The G15A variant shows a clear
perturbation from the WT network,
while still largely grouping like secondary structural elements together
(Figure 9). The degree
of U8 increased to 22 and now has the highest betweenness and closeness
values and has neighbors from the AS, the D-loop, TψC-loop,
and the variable region (Figure 9). G46 and C61 have the next highest closeness, whereas
the G18 residue has an approximately average closeness and interacts
exclusively with the TψC-loop. Instead of having a core region
with independent “arms” like the WT, the network topology
of the G15A variant is decentralized into two loosely connected main
groups, one containing the D-loop and the AC-loop and the other with
the TψC-loop and the AS.

Figure 9 G15A correlation network analysis. The
correlation networks show
each node color-coded by the tRNA secondary structure or variant,
consistent with the previous figures. The nodes are connected when
the correlations satisfy |Cij| ≥ 0.5. The betweenness and closeness plots as a function
of the number of neighbors highlight whether a nucleotide is important
to regulating dynamic allostery. In each plot, the points are colored
by secondary structure, and the size is determined by the number of
hydrogen bonds corresponding to that node, where a larger diameter
indicates more hydrogen bonds. Select bases are labeled by their corresponding
data points.

On the other hand, the
G18A network generally condenses down to
a more intraconnected topology (Figure 10). The betweenness for all the nodes of
G18A (Figure 10) drops
as compared to WT and even G15A, whereas the closeness increases on
the whole. Again, U8 shows a high closeness and a relatively large
degree, and A21, G52, and G22 show increased closeness as a result
of this nucleotide substitution, as shown in Figure 10. Similarly, the G19A network shows a more
compact topology compared to WT, with decreased betweenness and increased
closeness (Figure 11). In this configuration, G44 is the residue
with the highest closeness and degree.

Figure 10 G18A correlation network
analysis. The correlation networks show
each node color-coded by the tRNA secondary structure or variant,
consistent with the previous figures. The nodes are connected when
the correlations satisfy |Cij| ≥ 0.5. The betweenness and closeness plots as a function
of the number of neighbors highlight whether a nucleotide is important
to regulating dynamic allostery. In each plot, the points are colored
by the secondary structure, and the size is determined by the number
of hydrogen bonds corresponding to that node, where a larger diameter
indicates more hydrogen bonds. Select bases are labeled by their corresponding
data points.

Figure 11 G19A correlation network
analysis. The correlation networks show
each node color-coded by the tRNA secondary structure or variant,
consistent with the previous figures. The nodes are connected when
the correlations satisfy |Cij| ≥ 0.5. The betweenness and closeness plots as a function
of the number of neighbors highlight whether a nucleotide is important
to regulating dynamic allostery. In each plot, the points are colored
by the secondary structure, and the size is determined by the number
of hydrogen bonds corresponding to that node, where a larger diameter
indicates more hydrogen bonds. Select bases are labeled by their corresponding
data points.

Discussion
To
date, little is known about how long-range communication is
facilitated in tRNAs. Leveraging advances in simulation hardware and
software, our simulations probe the microsecond timescale, enabling
larger phase space sampling and more meaningful interpretation of
the results. A total of 16 μs of MD simulations provide details
about the possible structure–function relationships of the E. coli tRNAMet molecule. Ghosh and Vishveshwara16 presented a thorough analysis of the nanosecond
MD simulations of a MetRS–tRNAMet complex model
and used correlation network analysis to predict the allosteric regulation
pathways for the protein and tRNA. Here, we applied a similar correlation-based
network analysis of the tRNA to examine it in isolation and discern
the dynamic consequences of the base substitutions independent of
MetRS binding. This current work sets the stage for the experimental
and computational analysis of the E. coli MetRS–tRNAMet complex currently underway.

Comparisons of the all-atom MD simulations of G15A, G18A, and G19A
tRNAMet variants highlight how a single nucleotide substitution
perturbs the structure and dynamics from the WT behavior. The tertiary
structure is maintained throughout all simulations; yet, there are
distinct patterns of hydrogen bonds and correlation distinguishing
each configuration. Overall, the largest deviation from the WT behavior
occurs in the G18A variant, whereas G15A deviates the least. The hydrogen
bonds that persist in all four configurations indicate the bonds essential
for maintaining the tertiary structure. Although none of the single
substitutions fully disrupts the structure or correlations, any further
loss of hydrogen bonding may push the structure beyond a stability
threshold.

G18A Variant Deviates Most from WT Behavior
The G18A
variant consistently exhibits the largest deviation from the WT tRNAMet. The most distinct deviations appear in the D-loop and
TψC-loop, for example, showing increased fluctuations (Figure 3) and strongly anticorrelated
regions in the core (Figures 6 and 7). Although the G18A base substitution
disrupted the inner workings of the RNA, the overall tertiary structure
was relatively unchanged. The conformational change highlighted in Supporting Information Figure S6 is largely responsible
for the deviations shown in Figure 3.

Previous studies indicate that the nucleotides
13, 22, and 46 form an integral base triple in tRNACys.17 Mutations at the tRNACys 13:22 base
pair disrupts the 15:48 base pair and impairs aminoacylation.18 Our hydrogen-bonding network analysis suggests
that this base triple, especially nucleotide G22, is also important
in tRNAMet and would be a candidate for substitution in
the future. G18 and G22 in tRNAMet communicate with one
another in this network, and double substitutions may elucidate more
of the communication network within the tRNA core.

Core Substitutions
Disrupt Secondary But Not Tertiary Structure
The most highly
sampled conformations maintain the canonical L-shaped
tertiary structure essential for the aminoacylation and decoding functions
of tRNA (Figure 4).
Even the rarely sampled configurations (higher order cluster representatives
and unclustered structures) retain the overall tertiary structure
but show variation in the core, AC, and variable region orientations.
Although there are conformational alterations, they primarily occur
in the D-loop and TψC-loop, away from the functionally essential
AC and AS locations.

The largest apparent conformational rearrangement
of the core occurs in the G18A variant. This disparate behavior occurred
in just one of the four G18A simulations, in which the core rearrangement
is characterized by a separation of the D-loop from the TψC-loop,
as shown in Supporting Information Figure
S6. The L-shaped tertiary structure remains intact, but the large
core rearrangement between the D-loop and the TψC-loop contributes
to the atypical quantitative results throughout.

Nucleotides
U8 and G22 Are Key Communication Hubs
The
detailed hydrogen bond and correlation analyses have identified the
nucleotides that appear critical for the tRNAMet dynamics
and allostery, for example, the highly conserved residues U8 and G22.
Nucleotide U8 persisted as a hydrogen bond donor for A14 and as a
hub for allosteric communication, as shown in the correlation and
the corresponding network analysis in all simulations (8–11).
The role of E. coli tRNAMet U8 in aminoacylation has not been explicitly investigated, although
a U8C mutation in human mitochondrial tRNAMet (hmtRNAMet) has been shown to cause mitochondrial myopathy.19 hmtRNAMet is intrinsically less stable
than E. coli tRNAMet, as
it lacks guanosines at positions 18 and 19, giving it a shorter D-loop
and fewer hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions at the core;20 nevertheless, it is able to be aminoacylated
both by its cognate enzyme and by E. coli MetRS.21 Previous biochemical and biophysical
works showed that in the context of the weaker mitochondrial tRNAMet structure, the U8C substitution further decreased the secondary
and tertiary interactions and significantly decreased the aminoacylation
efficiency.21 It should be noted that U8
is typically modified to 4-thioU in bacterial tRNAs; this modification
is a sensor for cellular UV damage.22 Our
computational study considered only the unmodified version of tRNAMet, as the crystal structures used for MD were solved with
tRNA transcripts. The MetRS enzymes evaluated to date are able to
aminoacylate the tRNA transcripts,23 and
indeed the Aquifex aeolicus MetRS:tRNAMet crystal structure reveals no contacts between the enzyme
and U8.2

Although the simulations
reveal changes in flexibility and connectivity upon the introduction
of single nucleotide substitutions in the D-loop, they may not be
dramatic enough to disrupt the function. Substitutions to G18 and
G19, which normally interact with the TψC-loop, show a reduced
network topology, in that there are an increasing number of average
neighbors and a decreasing network diameter (Table S1). A variant
with two substitutions, including one core residue and another high
centrality residue from the correlation network (such as U8), may
well disrupt a functional biopolymer, in much the same way that the
U8C mutation leads to a disease phenotype in the structurally tenuous
hmtRNAMet.

Conclusions
In this study, by modeling
the E. coli tRNAMet via
MD with nucleotide substitutions at G15,
G18, and G19, the overall structure remains unchanged, whereas clear
differences appear in the local structure and dynamics. By configuring
MD simulations with single nucleotide substitutions at the known conserved
residues, we discern conformational dynamics in atomic detail and
hypothesize as to its functional impact. Overall, the tertiary structure
is preserved in silico for WT and three mutated configurations. The
data suggest that although there are local changes to the structure
and dynamics within the vicinity of the substitution, the G15A and
G19A variants closely resemble the overall dynamics of the WT tRNAMet. As such, the conformational variability of tRNA may well
allow it to remain functional despite the small, single-point perturbations
in particular locations. “On the other hand, the G18A variant
shows that the disruption caused by this substitution has a larger
impact on the long-range interactions of the polynucleotide. The disconnection
of the D-loop to the TψC-loop normally mediated by G18A alters
the mobility and the correlation compared to the WT tRNA and two other
variants.

Materials and Methods
Simulation Setup and Execution
The E.
coli tRNAMet structure was built from the A. aeolicus tRNAMet crystal structure
coordinates (unmodified tRNA transcript, MetRS–tRNA complex
PDB 2CSX) solved
at 2.7 Å resolution.2 The E. coli sequence was substituted for the A. aeolicus sequence using multiscale modeling tools
for structural biology.24 The three nucleotides
missing from the 3′-end of the tRNA in 2CSX were modeled into
the A. aeolicus tRNA crystal structure
coordinates using an E. coli tRNACys structure (CysRS–tRNA complex PDB 1U0B).25 The A. aeolicus geometries
and coordinates were used to build the starting E.
coli tRNAMet structure shown in Figure 1. The CHARMM36 force-field
parameters26,27 with the NAMD software package28 were used to energy-minimize the starting structure
to eliminate the steric clashes and optimize the starting reference
structure.

Each energy-minimized structure, with a unique set
of initial conditions, was set in a water box with dimensions (87
× 78 × 73) Å, and a particle mesh Ewald approximation
was used for long-range electrostatics with a grid size of (88 ×
78 × 74) Å.29 The all-atom simulations
were performed for 1 μs in quadruplicate on graphical processing
units after an additional minimization using ACEMD’s parallelized
MD package.30 All production simulations
were carried out under NPT conditions.31 The Berendsen barostat had a target pressure of 1.01325 bar, and
the Langevin thermostat had a target temperature of 298 K with a damping
coefficient of γ = 0.1.32,33 Using a hydrogen mass-repartitioning
scheme, allowing for 4 fs time steps, systems of this size readily
access the microsecond regime.30 All simulations
employed a TIP3P water model,34 and after
charge neutralization, ionization conditions of 150 mM NaCl. The simulations
did not contain Mg2+ known to stabilize the G15:C48 Levitt
pair.

Interestingly, the full pair was present more often in
the variants
in 57.9% of the simulations of G18A and 47.9% in G19A.

Construction
of tRNA Variants in Silico
The AS of tRNAMet is
thought to undergo a conformational change to fit into
the active site of MetRS for amino acid transfer. To date, there is
no available co-crystal structure of MetRS–tRNAMet that depicts this catalytic conformation. The tRNA portion of the A. aeolicus MetRS–tRNAMet co-crystal
structure (2CSX) is disordered at the nucleotides 74–76 of the tRNA AS, and
the atom positions are unresolved.25 However,
the CysRS:tRNACys co-crystal structure (1UOB) does show an AS
conformation likely similar to that of tRNAMet.25

To approximate the AS positions, the tRNACys CCA end was modeled onto the 3′ end of the A. aeolicus tRNAMet. The sequence of the
tRNA was then modified to represent the E. coli tRNAMet sequence (see Supporting Information Figure S1 for detailed nucleotide substitutions).
The tRNAsMet of both E. coli and A. aeolicus are 77 nucleotides
in length, and the two share 69% sequence identity, with the differences
mostly in the AC stem. The nucleotides in the D-loop and in the TψC-loop
are conserved and are known to form hydrogen bonds in the core.6

Analysis Methods
After the simulations
were completed,
water and ions were removed, and the frames were extracted using a
GUI interface to CatDCD.35,36 Every fourth frame
of the 2.5 ps raw data was kept, giving 10 ps resolution. The trajectory
was aligned to remove the translation and rotation that result from
diffusion. Once the trajectory files were of manageable size and aligned,
the RMSF of the trajectories were calculated for all 4 μs of
each configuration (cf. 3). The RMSF of atom i is
quantified as 1  where r⃗i(tj)
is the instantaneous position vector, r⃗i′ is the mean position of atom i, and T is the total number of frames.
The RMSFs for the tRNA are based on the positions of the C1′
atoms.

Conformational clustering was performed using the QT
algorithm of VMD,37 which is based on the
root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) measurements and requires the input
parameters of maximum cluster diameter and maximum number of clusters.
The algorithm compares the RMSD values among all frames, finds the
largest grouping of frames, labels that cluster 1, removes those frames
from the search space, and iterates until all frames are clustered,
or the maximum number of clusters (100) is reached. To optimize the
parameters used, small samples of the trajectories (for a quick analysis
on a subset of the whole sample) were subjected to the clustering
algorithm with various choices for the maximum cluster diameter, to
minimize the number of unclustered frames with a total of 100 possible
clusters. The clustering was performed on each configuration independently,
as well as on the backbone structure of all simulations concatenated.
The clustering images were rendered in tachyon, with the median structure
represented in color and the shadows depicted based on the statistical
analysis (1σ) of the cluster distribution.38−40

The hydrogen
bond analysis employed the tools available in MDAnalysis.41 Considering only polar atoms, bonds are considered
present if the donor and acceptor pair are within 3.2 Å from
one another and the angle between the donor–hydrogen–acceptor
triplet is greater than 120°, approximating a bond of intermediate
strength.42 A subsequent analysis was used
to determine the percentage occupancy for each bond (persisting for
more than 50% of the simulation), and these data were exported to
Cytoscape for network visualization and analysis.43

The correlated motions elucidate a coupled pairwise
motion between
atoms via a normalized covariance matrix. Completely correlated motions
(Cij = 1) occur when
one atom moves exactly in accordance with another (self-correlations
are always 1), and anticorrelated motions (Cij = −1) occur when two atoms move
in different directions from one another. As with the RMSF analysis,
tRNA correlations are based on the C1′ coordinates throughout
the trajectory. Here, this Pearson correlation is described by 2   3  where r⃗iα (r⃗jα) is the position vector
of atom i (j) at time α. The
covariance between two atoms, Cij, is normalized by the number of frames, N, after finding the scalar product of atom differences from their
average value. The correlation is then normalized by the diagonal
elements of the covariance matrix (cf. eq 3), such that the values range from −1
to 1.

The network analysis of tRNA–protein complexes
has been
useful in understanding the allosteric signal pathways.16,44 The network communities analyzed here were developed from the correlation
and hydrogen bond results. The hydrogen bond networks were based on
the donor–acceptor pairs present in more than 50% of the simulations
and, similarly, the correlation networks were based on moderate correlations
(|Cij| ≥ 0.5).
The network diagrams were generated and rendered using Cytoscape,
in which the correlation networks employed the edge-weighted, spring-embedded
layout based on edge betweenness (hydrogen bond layouts were manually
generated). The betweenness centrality quantifies the ability to control
the flow of information by analyzing the evenly weighted geodesics
and determining the node’s importance to the largest number
of shortest paths.45 If we consider a node pk, the probability bij(pk) of it being in a randomly selected geodesic of
the network (e.g., a random path between nodes pi and pj) is given by 4  where gij (gij(pk))is the number of geodesics
linking pi and pj (that contain pk) and N is the number
of nodes in the network. The normalized betweenness centrality is
then the sum of all bij(pk), where i ≠ k ≠ j. 5  

Similarly, closeness centrality quantifies the centrality measure
by considering the average length of the shortest paths between a
node and every other node in the network,46 given by 6  where dij is the shortest path distance
between nodes i and j.
