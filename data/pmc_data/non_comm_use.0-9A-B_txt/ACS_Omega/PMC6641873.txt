Tuning
sensing capabilities of simple to complex oxides for achieving
enhanced sensitivity and selectivity toward the detection of toxic
volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is extremely important and remains
a challenge. In the present work, we report the synthesis of pristine
and Ce-doped CuO hollow nanostructures, which have much higher VOC
sensing and response characteristics than their solid analogues. Undoped
CuO hollow nanostructures exhibit high response for sensing of acetone
as compared to commercial CuO nanoparticles. As a result of doping
with cerium, the material starts showing selectivity. CuO hollow structures
doped with 5 at. % of Ce return highest response toward methanol sensing,
whereas increasing the Ce doping concentration to 10%, the material
shows high response for both—acetone and methanol. The observed
tunability in selectivity is directly linked to the varying concentration
of the oxygen defects on the surface of the nanostructures. The work
also shows that the use of hollow nanostructures could be the way
forward for obtaining high-performance sensors even by using conventional
and simple metal or semiconductor oxides.

1 Introduction
With
the stringent implementation of rules, which ensure human
safety from air pollution in industries, ranging from cottage to defense,
the development of efficient gas sensors has gained much attention.1 Also in this case, the dangers associated with
sustained exposure to chemical vapors remain sometimes underestimated.
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs, e.g., acetone, methanol, ethanol,
etc.) possess high vapor pressures at room temperature, which increases
their exposure to humans, causing adverse health effects.2 For example, acetone, an extensively used chemical
in research laboratories and industry, is easily combustible, evaporates
at room temperature, and can be medically dangerous, if inhaled for
sustained periods. Unfortunately, these aspects are ignored by many
users. Another common organic solvent routinely used is methanol.
It also attracts high attention, as it is produced as a primary component
in biodiesel production and is a needed additive for dyes, etc.3−5

A variety of gas sensors have been developed based on different
operating principles, such as resistive (oxide or organic semiconductors),
electrochemical, surface acoustic wave, and field effect types.6−9 Among these gas sensors, semiconducting metal oxide-based resistive
gas sensors are most widely investigated owing to their low cost,
ease of production, simple measurement, higher sensitivity, lower
detection limits, versatility, and fast recovery times. Most commercial
products use metal oxides based on n- or p-type semiconductors, such
as SnO2, WO3, ZnO, CuO, Co3O4, and NiO, for the detection of toxic VOCs.10−15 Surface modification of these metal oxides such as ZnO by noble
metals, such as Au and Ag, has also been used as a strategy for enhanced
sensing toward acetone, ethanol, and trimethylamine.16−18 Composites of metal oxide viz. SnO2, Au, and graphene
oxide have also been used as an alternative for enhanced ethanol sensing.2 However, the performance of these metal oxides
is still limited because of their low selectivity toward different
VOCs. To improve the performance and to induce higher surface kinetics,
the strategy of altering the particle morphology and defect concentrations
by using suitable dopants has been proposed.19,20 However, this doping leads to an appreciable increase in the cost.
It must be mentioned that many novel and intriguing morphologies have
been synthesized and used.21,22

Various morphologies
of CuO and derived materials have been earlier
investigated for sensing NO2, H2S, NH3, CO, and C2H5OH in a working temperature range
of 200–400 °C.23−27 Recently, its application has also been shown for detection of different
VOCs.15 In this work, using this conventionally
used simple oxide of copper (i.e., CuO), it is shown that a hitherto
unexplored strategy of using hollow nanostructures can bring quantum
jump in gas-sensing capabilities. The results, after comparison with
the available literature, clearly suggest that using composites based
on expensive components, such as graphene and reduced graphite oxide,
may not actually be required if the hollow particles are carefully
tuned. These results would lead to a significant cost reduction of
the final device.

2 Methods
2.1 Synthesis
of Ce-Doped CuO Nanostructures
For the synthesis of undoped
and Ce-doped CuO hollow nanostructures,
the technique of inverse miniemulsion was followed.28,29 In a typical synthesis procedure, as shown in Scheme 1, the dispersed phase was prepared by dissolving
stoichiometric amounts of precursor salts Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (Fluka, p.a., ≥99.0%) and Cu(NO3)2·2H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99%)
in water while maintaining a concentration of 0.5 M. A solution (1
wt %) of the surfactant poly(isobutylene succinimide pentamine) (PIBSP,
OS85737, Lubrizol France, Rouen) in toluene (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.7%)
was prepared and used as the continuous phase. The dispersed and continuous
phases were mixed in a 1:4 weight ratio and pre-emulsified by stirring
for 30 min at 1000 rpm. Subsequently, the mixture was ultrasonified
for 3 min (Branson Sonifier W-450D, 1/2″ tip, 70% amplitude,
1 s pulse, 0.1 s pause) while it was kept in an ice bath. Triethylamine
(TEA, Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99.5%), in a proportion of 3 equiv with
respect to the Cu(II) precursor, was rapidly added by using a syringe.
The emulsion was kept under constant stirring for 4 h at 1000 rpm
at 80 °C to ensure homogenization and completion of the reaction.
The precipitate was separated from the dispersion by centrifugation
for 20 min at 4000 rpm. The obtained powders were washed with ethanol
(twice), deionized water (twice), and acetone (once). After each washing
process, the dispersion was centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm. To
investigate the gas-sensing properties, dense undoped and Ce3+-doped CuO powders were obtained by a thermal treatment at 250 °C
for 4 h.

2.2 Structural, Morphological, and Chemical Characterization
For structural characterization of the prepared samples, powder
X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded using a PANalytical high-resolution
diffractometer PW 3040/60 with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54
Å) as the incident wavelength. The diffraction pattern was collected
in the 2θ range 10°–100°, and structure refinement
was performed using the Fullprof software.

The morphology of
the samples was investigated using transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) with a JEOL 1400 microscope. For TEM measurements, small amounts
of the colloidal dispersions were diluted in an identical organic
phase and drop-casted onto carbon-coated Cu grids.

2.3 Gas Sensing Measurements
To perform
gas sensing experiments, the hollow nanostructured CuO-based sensing
materials were dispersed in 20 mL of acetone and subsequently drop-casted
on a Pt-based interdigitized electrode (Synkera Technologies) with
an interfinger gap of 100 μm. The device was then mounted on
a hot chuck fitted in a stainless steel airtight probe station and
probed for the subsequent measurements. The gas flow was controlled
by digital mass flow controllers (Alicat Instruments Ltd.), and the
data were recorded using Agilent 34972A LXI data acquisition card
for further analysis. The baseline resistance was confirmed by flowing
compressed air at a rate of 500 sccm for 3 h. The VOC (in the liquid
form) was taken in a bubbler, and air was bubbled to form subsequent
vapors before being passed into the chamber. In this work, the sensor
response was defined as the ratio Rgas/Rair, where Rair and Rgas are the resistance of the sensing
material in the presence of air and different analyte VOCs, respectively.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Crystal
Structure and Morphology
The minimization of agglomeration
during the growth of nanoparticles
is a critical issue to make the synthetic protocols at low temperatures
more useful. As mentioned in Methods, in the
present case, the crystallization of the hollow nanostructures was
induced at a reasonably low temperature of 80 °C. For most metal
oxides, single-phase formation at such low temperatures is difficult.
Therefore, X-ray diffraction studies were performed to prove that
single-phase CuO and Ce-doped CuO can be achieved, even at such low
to moderate temperatures. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns for the
samples under investigation are shown in Figure 1. The diffraction profiles are consistent
with those expected for polycrystalline samples. The peaks can be
indexed using the monoclinic phase of CuO (JCPDS card no. 48-1548),
with no discernible signatures due to impurity phase(s).

of the undoped and 5 and 10% Ce-doped CuO.

The chemical or sensing capability in nanostructures is directly
linked to the exposed surface, which can synergistically contribute
in the overall electron-exchange kinetics. TEM micrographs of the
CuO-based nanostructures, with up to 10% Ce doping, are shown in Figure 2a–c (Figure S1 shows the high-resolution TEM images
of CuO hollow nanostructures). Both doped and undoped samples indicated
the formation of hollow nanostructures, with varying cavity size.
Additionally, the Ce-doped CuO hollow structures were predominantly
made up by assembling of nanorods and nanoparticles. In comparison,
the hollow nanostructures for the pure CuO (Figure 2a) were a convoluted picture of entangled
rodlike structures appearing at the droplet interface. With increasing
cerium concentrations, the particle morphology showed transformation
from porous to solid shell-like. The results for samples with up to
20% cerium doping also showed a similar trend. The details are given
in the Supporting Information (Figure S2).

hollow nanostructures.

Formation of hollow structures within the confined droplets
of
miniemulsions can be achieved by enforcing precipitation at the droplet
interface.30,31 These conditions can be produced
by the combined effects of controlled diffusion of precipitating agent
and increased concentration of reactant metallic ions (by complexation
with the surfactant) near the droplet interface.28,32 In the present study, the amphiphilic nature of TEA and the electronegative
amino groups from the surfactant PIBSP are important factors for the
increased concentration of reactants at the interface. The growth
of Ce-doped CuO hollow structures can be rationalized by the simplified
mechanism depicted in Figure 3. Because of the presence of the base TEA and the surfactant
PIBSP, metallic Cu ions precipitate in the form of Cu(OH)2 nanorods at the droplet interface, resulting in the formation of
hollow nanostructures made up by the entanglement of nanorods at the
exterior. However, along with these conditions, when Ce ions are added
to the system to prepare the doped samples, Ce ions also precipitate
as particulate Ce(OH)3, formed along with the precipitated
Cu(OH)2 nanorods (Figure 3a,b). This induces the formation of Ce-doped hollow
nanostructures with both nanorods and nanoparticles at the exterior
(Figure 3c). Smaller
precipitated particles of cerium hydroxide possess higher solubility
in the solution, and therefore there is a higher probability for Ostwald
ripening to occur at the droplet interface, which can be a reason
for the observable opening of the hollow morphologies for Ce-doped
CuO as compared to the undoped CuO. This would also explain the conversion
toward better solid shells in the higher Ce-doped CuO hollow structures.

hollow nanostructures showing (a) complexation between surfactant
amino groups and Cu ions, (b) precipitation using TEA, and (c) formation
of the hollow nanostructures.

3.2 Chemical Characterization
Chemical
composition and the presence of both oxygen vacancies and valence
state of Ce in the samples were characterized by the X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) measurements in the doped samples (Figure 4). As reported previously,
undoped hollow nanostructures of CuO show only the presence of the
oxidation state 2+ for Cu in the samples; hence, no oxygen vacant
sites are found in the samples.28 The higher
binding energy peak in the O 1s spectra refers to the oxygen absorbed
on the surface. In the cases of the samples doped with 5 and 10% Ce,
also the presence of the 2+ oxidation state of Cu was detected (Supporting Information Figure S3). The Ce 3d
spectra shown in Figure 4a,b confirmed both 3+ and 4+ oxidation states of Ce in the doped
samples. These spectra were deconvoluted similarly to previously reported,
in the case of CeO2 nanostructures, for quantification
of the 3+ and 4+ oxidation states (Tables S1 and S2 show the binding energies of the
deconvoluted peaks, which are consistent with the reported data).33,34 Relative concentrations of the 3+ oxidation state of Ce in the samples
were calculated to be 0.48 and 0.36, in the cases of 5 and 10% Ce-doped
CuO, respectively.

Figure 4 Deconvoluted XPS spectra of (a,c) Ce 3d and (b,d) O 1s
core levels
for 5 and 10% Ce-doped CuO samples.

A similar behavior was observed in the case of oxygen defect
concentration,
which was confirmed by the deconvolution of O 1s spectra shown in Figure 4c,d. The higher binding
energy peak of the O 1s spectra is attributed to the oxygen defects
on the surface caused by the doping of Ce3+ and Ce4+ in CuO, which can be clearly seen from the deconvoluted
peaks of the O 1s spectra. The relative concentration of the higher
binding energy peak to the lower binding energy peak (OHBE/OLBE) ascribed to oxygen
defects was higher for the 5% Ce-doped samples than 10% Ce-doped CuO.
These (OHBE/OLBE) ratios were calculated to be 0.40 and 0.32 for the 5 and 10% Ce-doped
samples, respectively. The observed change in the Ce3+ and
oxygen defect concentration can be explained by considering the doping
concentration. At a lower doping concentration of Ce in CuO, the quantity
of substituted Ce3+ ions will be higher and therefore the
lower the probability of Ce3+ getting oxidized. At a higher
doping concentration (say, 10%), Ce will reduce the quantity of substituted
Ce ions and many Ce3+ clusters will exist in the samples,
which can oxidize after precipitation. This will lead to reduced Ce3+ concentration as well as oxygen defects in the nanostructures.

3.3 Sensing Performance toward VOCs
The
sensors show the highest response at an optimum temperature because
of the preferential adsorption of O–, which is most
reactive toward VOCs. Therefore, the temperature profile of the sensor
(using 3500 ppm of acetone) was tested, and the response was found
to be maximum at 200 °C (shown in Figure 5a). Subsequently, the sensing response at
200 °C in the concentration range 3500–14 000 ppm
was tested. The related graphs are presented in Figure 5b. The sensor response varied from 22 to
32 times.

Figure 5 Comparison of the sensing performance of commercial CuO and the
CuO hollow nanostructures prepared in this work. (a) Sensitivity of
the gas sensor to 3500 ppm acetone, over a temperature range of 150–300
°C, (b) transient gas response of the sensor with exposure to
different concentrations of acetone at 200 °C, and (c) response
values for different VOCs.

Commercially available copper(II) oxide was also tested in
the
presence of acetone at 200 °C (also shown in Figure 5b). Transient gas response
for all measurements is also plotted in actual sensor resistance values
and shown in the Supporting Information (Figures S4 and S5). As evident from Figure 5b, the hollow nanostructures were highly
sensitive as compared to their commercial counterparts. Such a variation
may be attributed to the difference in the specific surface area and
porosity of the two materials. The hollow nanostructures possess a
higher surface area (∼85 m2/g, reported previously28) and porosity, which means an increased number
of active adsorption sites for chemical sorption–desorption
processes. Changes in the surface area and porosity of Ce-doped CuO
hollow nanostructures may affect the sensing properties.35 5 and 10% Ce-doped CuO hollow nanostructures
showed higher specific surface areas viz., ∼144 and ∼154
m2/g, respectively, and smaller pores as compared to the
undoped CuO hollow nanostructures (Figure S6). The CuO hollow nanostructure sensor response was also superior
as compared to previous reports on CuO-based nanomaterials (Supporting Information Table S3). From the plot,
the limit of detection (LOD) was also estimated for both the samples
(Supporting Information). The LOD for the
commercial sample was ∼3298 ppm, whereas it was ∼980
ppb for our CuO spheres.

The response of the hollow nanostructures
of CuO was also tested
in the presence of several other VOCs including methanol, ethanol,
chloroform, and toluene (presented in Figure 1c). It was found that the sensor had much
higher response toward acetone as compared to other VOCs, indicating
a high selectivity toward acetone.

The sensing performance of
5 and 10% Ce-doped CuO hollow nanostructures
was tested in the presence of different VOCs. However, a change in
the chemical composition can cause a change in the optimum temperature.
Therefore, the temperature profiles for the doped samples were also
tested in the presence of 3500 ppm concentration of methanol and acetone.
For both of these samples, the maximum operating temperature was found
to be at 250 °C for both the VOCs (depicted in Figure 6a). The dynamic responses of
5 and 10% Ce-doped CuO samples are presented in Figure 6b,c (from 900 to 14 500 ppm concentrations).
As the doping percentage was increased from 0 to 5% Ce, the doped
sample showed the highest response for methanol in comparison to other
tested VOCs. The response for 5% Ce-doped CuO samples was 28 times
toward methanol and 12 times for acetone, as evident from Figure 6.

Figure 6 Sensing performance of
5 and 10% Ce-doped CuO samples: tunability
of selectivity from methanol (for 5%) to acetone (for 10%). (a) Sensitivity
of the gas sensor to 3500 ppm acetone, over a temperature range of
150–300 °C, and transient gas response of the sensor with
exposure to different concentrations of (b) acetone and (c) methanol
for 5 and 10% Ce-doped CuO at 250 °C.

The response was found to be much lesser for other VOCs.
As the
doping percentage of Ce was increased from 5 to 10% in CuO samples,
the sensor was more responsive toward both acetone and methanol. In
this case (10% doped sample), the response was 22 times toward acetone
and 18 times for methanol at 3500 ppm concentrations. The LOD values
calculated for the 5% Ce-doped CuO samples for acetone and methanol
were 9.80 and 1.03 ppm, respectively. For the 10% Ce-doped CuO samples,
the calculated LOD values in the presence of acetone and methanol
were 2.65 and 5.99 ppm, respectively. A comparison of the response
of undoped and Ce-doped CuO samples toward the tested VOCs is depicted
in Figure 7. It can
be clearly seen that the highest response toward acetone in the undoped
CuO samples changed to highest response and selectivity to methanol
in the 5% doped samples. In addition, the 10%-doped samples showed
enhanced response for both acetone and methanol. Therefore, the doping
of Ce in CuO samples causes tunability in the optimum response and
selectivity toward VOCs, which depends predominantly on the doping
concentrations of cerium.

and 5 and 10% Ce-doped
CuO samples at a 3500 ppm concentration of VOCs.

To understand the observed response in CuO hollow nanostructures
toward acetone and changes after Ce doping, it is necessary to explain
the mechanism for sensing of VOCs using metal oxide as active materials.
When air comes in contact with the metal oxide surface, oxygen molecules
from the air get adsorbed in the form of different species O–, O2–, and O2– onto
the surface of metal oxides by trapping the free surface electrons
from the conduction band of the metal oxides. The ionosorption of
the species of O2–, O–, and O2– is known to be dominant at <150 °C,
between 150 and 400 °C, and >400 °C, respectively.36 This adsorption process leads to the creation
of more holes available near the surface and formation of a hole accumulation
layer (HAL) in p-type metal oxides such as CuO. The adsorbed oxygen
acts as active reaction sites for the reducing VOCs to get attached.
Upon exposure of the VOCs, they are oxidized by these oxygen reactive
species, resulting in the creation of electrons and decreasing the
concentration of holes in the surface layer. Consequently, an increase
in the resistance is observed in the p-type metal oxide semiconductors
upon exposure to VOCs. The reactions mentioned in the mechanism are
mentioned below:

Adsorption of oxygen species:      

When these materials
are exposed to toluene, chloroform, methanol,
or acetone, the following reactions may take place.37,38        

In the case of ethanol, the reaction with adsorbed oxygen
species
depends upon the acid–base properties of the sensing material.
Ethanol is decomposed to the intermediate state C2H4 in the case of acidic oxide, whereas it will convert to CH3CHO for basic oxide by the following reaction:    

Copper oxide is basic
in nature. Thus, it will dehydrate to CH3CHO. This intermediate
state will react with surface-adsorbed
oxygen species, which is given below.  

In all above reactions, electrons are released and lead to
reduction
of the hole concentration in p-type CuO-sensing material. As a result,
the resistance of the sensing layer increases. It is also observed
that the highest numbers of electrons are released in the case of
acetone compared to other VOCs. The experimental results showed that
only CuO has the highest response toward acetone at 200 °C, which
suggests its maximum interaction with the surface oxygen species.

When Ce is doped in CuO, Ce4+ is replaced with Cu2+. Thus, Ce stays at CeO2 form in copper oxide.
Cerium oxide can show both basic and acidic properties. Thus, for
cerium-doped copper oxide, both dehydrogenation to C2H4 and dehydration to CH3CHO reactions can happen.
C2H4 will react with oxygen by the following
equation.  

According to the above discussion, it can be suggested that
the
adsorption of the oxygen reactive species on the surface of the metal
oxide surface will determine the sensing performance toward different
VOCs. This adsorption can be affected by several of the following
reasons:(i) Different metal ions: this can cause
the change in the electrical properties (total charge density) of
the materials, which would cause the interaction between metal surface
and adsorbing species to change, therefore changing the final adsorption.

(ii) Temperature: it causes
the selective
adsorption of oxygen ions on the material surface. In the present
case, the effects of the temperature were neutralized by operating
the sensors at the optimum temperatures.

(iii) Surface defects and roughness: defects
such as rough surface, oxygen defects (vacancies and interstitial),
and disordered structures and boundaries on the surface of materials
can enhance the adsorption of oxygen from the atmosphere, which can
improve the gas-sensing properties.

(iv) Surface area and porosity: enhanced
surface area and porosity can also enhance the oxygen ion adsorption
and the properties. In addition to these, kinetic diameter of the
adsorbing VOCs may also affect the sensing response.



The effects of the metal ion doping on the surface charge
were
characterized by the zeta potential measurements. From the measurement
data shown in Figure 8, the surface negativity was found to be maximum for CuO. The surface
negativity decreases, as we increase the Ce amount, which is obvious
because Cu2+ is replaced by Ce3+. Hence, as
the number of electrons increase, the value of HAL decreases. This
leads to reduced surface negativity and resistance of the sensing
material. This can be a possible reason for the enhanced sensitivity.
However, as expected, with higher doping, the negativity also decreases;
therefore, the decrease in methanol response and the increase in acetone
response at 10% Ce doping as compared to 5% Ce doping cannot be explained.
The changes observed in the surface area and porosity due to the doping
and change in morphology can cause the increase in the performance
toward sensing, but it is also difficult to explain why this change
will be positive for one VOC and not for the other ones tested.

Figure 8 Zeta potential
of 5 and 10% Ce-doped CuO hollow nanostructure dispersions
in water at 50 mg/L concentration and pH 7.0.

Defects on the surface, such as oxygen defects, can also
alter
the performance. A higher number of defects on the surface can create
more sites for oxygen adsorption, which leads to a higher concentration
of oxygen reactive species at the surface. Therefore, a high number
of reducing gas molecules can react with the oxygen species at the
surface, leading to higher change in the resistance. Therefore, a
higher response would be observed at doping a concentration of Ce3+ in CuO, where the concentration of defects would be highest.
The relative concentration of the oxygen defects, calculated by the
analysis of the XPS data, is found to be 0.40 in the case of 5% doping
of Ce3+, which was much higher than the value of 0.32 in
the 10% doping of Ce3+ in CuO. This is compared to the
undoped CuO samples, where the defects would be minimal. If we compare
this and the data shown in Figure 7, it is clear that the sensing of methanol clearly
correlates with the concentration of oxygen defects. At the highest
oxygen defect concentration in the 5%-doped samples, the maximum response
toward methanol is observed, which is lower in 10% Ce-doped and undoped
CuO samples. Similarly, in the case of acetone, the highest response
is observed when the defect concentrations are lower, that is, in
the undoped samples followed by 10 and 5% Ce-doped CuO samples. Therefore,
by careful analysis, we can say that in our samples, oxygen defects
can cause the sensing response toward different VOCs to change.

Similar changes in the VOC-sensing performance have been earlier
reported in Nd-doped SnO2 materials.39 The authors reported enhanced response with Nd doping in
the case of alcohol (ethanol) as compared to the undoped samples where
it decreases for other VOCs (methanol). Even, the trend of the response
with doping was not found similar for different VOCs. In that work,
the authors predominantly discussed the case of increase in the sensing
toward ethanol. However, the cases where the sensing was not enhanced
or contradictory were not debated. In our case, data analysis of the
doped nanostructures confirms that the sensing of different VOCs shows
a possible relation/trend with the concentration of the surface defects
in the materials. We observe that the increase in oxygen defect concentration
works in favor for the sensing of methanol, whereas this is opposite
in the case of acetone. In addition to the reasons mentioned above,
the difference in the sensitivity of different VOCs with respect to
the defect concentration could also be due to the physical properties
of VOCs. As the kinetic diameter of methanol (0.36 nm) is lower than
that of acetone (∼0.469 nm), methanol could be more adsorbing
at the defect surfaces.38,40 In addition, oxygen
vacant sites in the crystal structure refer to deficiency of negative
charge; therefore, metal oxide can be considered as showing acidic
properties.41 A difference in the electronegative
character of the VOCs due to the presence of different electronegative
groups could cause the interaction of the molecules with the adsorbed
oxygen or the metal oxide surface to change and can make it easier
or difficult for metal oxides to accept the electrons. This could
also be responsible for the observed change in the sensing behavior
for the samples with varying defect concentrations.

4 Conclusions
Undoped and Ce-doped CuO hollow nanostructures
synthesized using
the inverse miniemulsion strategy show enhancement and tuning in the
sensing response toward VOCs. Changes observed in the morphological
nature of the Ce-doped hollow nanostructures are explained using the
growth mechanism in confined droplets. Hollow nanostructures of undoped
CuO show extremely high response and selectivity toward acetone as
compared to the commercial CuO. In the case of 5% Ce-doped hollow
structures, high response and selectivity for methanol is observed,
and at 10% Ce doping, high response and selectivity toward both acetone
and methanol is observed simultaneously. Amongst the various possible
reasons for the observed increase in response and tunability in the
VOC selectivity, the change in the oxygen defect concentration upon
Ce doping is found to be a possible and plausible reason as compared
to other reasons such as metal ion dependency, temperature, and surface
area. The observed enhancement in the sensing response of CuO hollow
nanostructures makes it extremely important to study other hollow
metal oxide-based nanomaterials for sensing applications.
