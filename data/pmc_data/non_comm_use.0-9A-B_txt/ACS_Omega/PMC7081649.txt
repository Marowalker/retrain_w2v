Plants are the main
sources of many high-value bioactive terpenoids
used in the medical, fragrance, and food industries. Increasing demand
for these bioactive plants and their derivative products (e.g., cannabis
and extracts thereof) requires robust approaches to verify feedstock,
identify product adulteration, and ensure product safety. Reported
here are single-laboratory validation details for a robust testing
method to quantitate select terpenes and terpenoids in dry plant materials
and terpenoid-containing vaping liquids (e.g., a derivative product)
using high-temperature headspace gas chromatography–mass spectrometry,
with glycerol used as a headspace solvent. Validated method recoveries
were 75–103%, with excellent repeatability (relative standard
deviation (RSD) < 5%) and intermediate precision (RSD < 12%).
The use of high-temperature headspace (180 °C) permitted terpene
and terpenoid profiles to be monitored at temperatures consistent
with vaping conditions.

==== Body
Introduction
Medicinal and psychoactive
plants have been used throughout human
history, with bioactive small molecules, also known as natural products
or specialized metabolites, being the key components that elicit biological
effects. Although significant progress in biotechnology and chemical
synthesis of these valuable molecules has been made, plants remain
the main source for most of them.1,2 Reliable and
robust authentication procedures are therefore needed to help commercial
suppliers of natural product-containing plants and their derived products
validate the integrity of their supply chain, while at the same time
providing regulatory agencies with tools to evaluate product authenticity
and safety.3,4 This has become a more pressing issue as
the market for bioactive plants and their extracts are fast expanding,
particularly following the legalization of recreational cannabis (Cannabis sativa L.) consumption in jurisdictions
around the world.

Of all the natural products found in plants,
terpenoids constitute
the largest, most functionally and structurally diverse class with
more than 50 000 compounds identified to date.5 Some terpenes and terpenoids have been reported to possess
anticancer, pesticidal, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and immuno-modulatory
properties.6−9 While these bioactive properties are of immense academic and industrial
interest, terpenes and terpenoids are still best known for their flavor
and aroma profiles that contribute to consumer preferences (e.g.,
essential oils, food flavoring, perfume, etc.). Such preferences are
becoming apparent in the way consumers select the cannabis they are
purchasing for recreational purposes as well.10,11 In addition to their distinct sensory attributes, terpenes and terpenoids
may exert some “entourage” neurological effects on the
cannabis user experience,12,13 all of which make their
accurate quantitation a critical analytical objective.

In cannabis,
terpene and terpenoid profiles include many mono-
and sesquiterpenoids (Figure 1) at different abundance levels, in addition to the well-known
psychoactive Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC) and the bioactive cannabidiol (CBD).14,15 Regardless of different opinions on the medicinal value of cannabis,
existing evidence suggests that it should be subjected to rigorous
quality and safety tests before entering the market, as is required
for other bioactive plant and natural health products.16,17 Given their potential bioactivity, such characterization should
include terpenoid quantitation.

Figure 1 Select terpenes and terpenoids naturally
occurring in important
medicinal and recreational plants such as cannabis and included in
this work.

In addition to their natural occurrence
in plant materials, terpenoids
are found in e-cigarette vaping liquids (e-juices) and supplements
where they impart a wide range of flavors (i.e., piney, sweet, succulent,
bitter, citrusy, etc.). Although adding flavors is prohibited in conventional
cigarette products in Canada, the United States, and the European
Union, at the time of manuscript preparation, this is not the case
for e-juices. Such flavorants appeal to users despite the possible
health implications of vaping.18 This is
of acute public concern given that vaping has long been advertised
as a safer alternative to smoking and has particularly attracted younger
consumers. With recent vaping-related deaths and subsequent legislative
proposals to ban or at least discourage flavorant-added e-juices,19,20 it is important that flavorants, including terpenoids, in vaping
liquids should be analyzed quantitatively for quality control purposes.
Such efforts will support an understanding of the potential safety
impacts that they may have.

Analysis of terpenes and terpenoids
in plants and other products
generally involves organic solvent extraction of plant materials followed
by direct injection and analysis by gas chromatography (GC) coupled
with flame ionization or mass spectrometry (MS) detectors.21−23 While effective at yielding an exhaustive chemical profile from
the plant materials’ complex organic matrix, several extraction
steps using organic solvents and sample concentration may be required.24 In addition, complex sample matrices could be
problematic for direct injection due to coextracted matrix interferences—particularly
for gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) where
the coextracted low-volatility macromolecules can interfere with chromatography
and introduce contamination in injection ports.

Headspace sampling
techniques are frequently employed, as only
compounds with suitable vapor pressures are analyzed.25−27 Furthermore, the resulting gas phase phytochemicals may better reflect
those compounds that users of vaporized products are exposed to. In
addition, much of the sensory attributes to these products are related
to terpenes and terpenoids—such users do not employ vigorous,
exhaustive extraction with organic solvents prior to product use.
This is especially true of materials that are highly processed or
intended for inhalation after combustion or high-temperature vaporization.
Headspace solid-phase microextraction (SPME) methods have been developed
for analyzing terpenoids in liquid and solid plant products,23,28,29 but variation in chemical selectivity
depending on the chemistry of the fiber can make comprehensive terpenoid
quantitation difficult. Full evaporative transfer (FET) is an alternate
approach that has been recently reported for the quantitation of 93
terpenes and terpenoids in cannabis.27 While
FET does not suffer from the challenges of SPME fiber chemistry, care
must be taken when using FET, as it could be problematic if nontrivial
sample amounts (e.g., >5 mg) are used; higher sample quantities
are
likely required to ensure representative results, even after thorough
processing.23,30

Here, we present the use
of GC–MS with high-temperature
headspace sampling for the quantitation of select terpenes and terpenoids
in plant samples and e-juices. The reported method is simple, sensitive,
and specific, and should be broadly amenable to the quantitation of
all mono- and sesquiterpenoids due to the high-temperature incubation
utilized. To demonstrate high-temperature headspace GC–MS as
an effective tool to analyze various matrices and analyte classes,
method validation data are presented for cannabis terpenoid mixtures
and e-juice matrices in addition to plant materials.

Results and Discussion
Method
Development and Optimization
The chromatographic
gradient was optimized to resolve all 30 mono- and sesquiterpenoids
of interest using the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode (Table S1; Figures 1 and 2). Using this thermal
program, the stable working conditions for the system were optimized
by establishing analyte recoveries and response repeatability. This
was evaluated using a range of stock solvents, headspace carrier liquids,
and vial incubation and loop/sample path temperatures (with 10–12
replicate injections under all conditions evaluated).

(SIM) chromatogram for the select
terpenes and terpenoids under investigation. Numbers represent structures
depicted in Figure 1. IS: internal standard, (±)-linalool-d3.

The first headspace liquid examined was brine,
as this is an inexpensive
and easily prepared solution that should increase the equilibrium
vapor pressure of terpenes. Terpenoid standards were prepared in hexanes
at 1 μg/mL and fortified to 5 ng/mL in 5 mL of brine. These
samples were analyzed with a 5:1 split ratio and vial incubation and
sample loop temperatures of 85 °C. The intention with this approach
was to leverage the ability of hexane to quantitatively extract terpenes
from plant materials with the reduction of coextraction interferences
that headspace analysis would provide. Analyte responses showed low
calculated relative standard deviations (RSD; ≤ 5%) for the
low-boiling analytes (mostly nonoxygenated monoterpenes, compounds 1–13, Figure 1), and larger variations (up to 20% RSD) for the higher boiling
components (oxygenated monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids, compounds 14–30, Figure 1). To improve method precision, different sample path temperatures
(95–125 °C) were evaluated, as the higher sample path
temperatures might prevent condensation of analytes. In addition,
higher septum purge flows (10 and 20 mL/min) were also evaluated for
possible flow dynamic effects within the high-temperature headspace
sampler. Results showed that an offset of 10–20 °C between
vial incubation and sample path temperatures and a purge flow of 20
mL/min improved the precision of instrumental replicates (n = 10). At 5 mL/min purge flow, a 100 °C sample path
temperature produced all RSD values below 20%, with all but three
below 10%. When higher septum purge flows were applied, all RSDs were
less than 10% at 100 and 125 °C sample path temperatures (Table 1). Neither increasing
septum purge flow beyond 20 mL/min nor changing needle purge flow
levels improved the RSDs further. A substantial gap between vial incubation
and sample path temperatures (85 and 190 °C) did not improve
repeatability (Table 1).

Additional headspace
liquids were explored, including dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethylformamide (DMF), and glycerol. It was hypothesized
that their higher boiling points compared to water might improve the
equilibrium vapor pressure of terpenes with lower inherent volatility
(i.e., higher boiling terpenes). Also, the ability to use high temperatures
with glycerol would facilitate investigations into profiling terpenoids
across a wider range of incubation temperatures (vide infra). Analysis
of terpenes and terpenoids fortified in DMSO and DMF at various incubation
temperatures up to 175 and 140 °C, respectively, revealed low
signal-to-noise ratios for most analytes, and nondetects for many
others (data not shown). For this reason, further evaluations with
these solvents were not explored. Conversely, when glycerol was used,
the most abundant raw responses for higher boiling terpenes were observed
(relative to brine), likely due to the utilized vial incubation temperature
of 180 °C and a sample path temperature of 200 °C. Of the
headspace liquids evaluated, glycerol was unique in permitting the
exploration of very high incubation temperatures due to its boiling
point of 290 °C, versus 189 and 153 °C for DMSO and DMF,
respectively. This facilitated the better transfer of analytes to
the gas phase, and improved precision.

It was interesting to
note that analyte recoveries for calibrators
and spike-recovery samples using glycerol as the headspace solvent
were dependent on the solvent used to prepare the terpenoid stock
solutions. The low-boiling solvent hexanes (68 °C) and the high-boiling
solvent tetradecane (254 °C) were used to investigate this effect.
Analyses of samples fortified with terpenoids in the absence of plant
material (i.e., a calibration sample) in hexane-based stocks showed
that glycerol samples displayed higher absolute responses for low-boiling
terpenoids (compounds 1–13, Figure 1), but lower absolute responses (as low as
10–20%) for high-boiling terpenoids (compounds 14–30, Figure 1) compared
to brine samples. When the analogous tetradecane-based terpenoid stocks
were used, most analytes displayed higher responses with glycerol
compared to brine (Figure S1). This suggested
that the solvents used to prepare stock solutions increased the partial
pressure in the headspace such that the amount of analyte in the headspace
decreased when the low-boiling hexane was used. It is postulated that
the higher boiling point of tetradecane mitigated this effect. When
the plant material was also present in the headspace vials, higher
absolute responses relative to the data obtained in brine were observed
for the majority of terpenoids when glycerol was used regardless of
terpenoid stock solvents (hexanes or tetradecane). The reason for
this effect is currently being explored.

Based on these investigations,
terpenoid stock solutions for calibration
samples and spike-recovery tests were prepared in tetradecane and
glycerol was selected as the optimal headspace carrier liquid.

Method
Validation for Plant Tissue Analysis
The developed
method was evaluated for the dynamic range, repeatability (n = 5), intermediate precision (n = 17,
over three days), carry-over, method detection limit (MDL), method
reporting limit (MRL), and spike recovery. Calibration functions for
all 30 terpenes and terpenoids were determined from 25 to 4000 ng/mL
(equivalent to 2.5–400 ppm in plant material; dynamic range
= 2.2). The split ratio can be adjusted to accommodate different expected
terpenoid concentrations or to permit the evaluation of different
quantities of plant material (i.e., not 50 mg). However, the issue
of suitable sample quantity to overcome potential homogeneity issues
needs to be considered; erring on the side of more material sampled
for a given analysis is generally the prudent approach, with the authors
suggesting 50 mg as a minimum quantity. Across a range of 25–4000
ng/mL, all calibration functions had correlation coefficients >0.99
and the accuracy of all calibration concentrations were ± 20%
(data not shown). The calibration functions were consistent across
three days of method validation and subsequent sample analyses. Additionally,
all analytes presented with <0.1% carry-over when a method blank
was analyzed immediately after a high concentration calibration sample.

Stinging nettle was selected as the matrix for method development,
and validation as the dry tissues of this plant contain nominal incurred
terpenoids, which made it an ideal blank matrix with which spike-recovery
studies could be conducted (Figure S2).
This was necessary for the method development reported herein, as
the intended matrices for this method (i.e., cannabis and industrial
hemp) have high concentrations of many terpenoids, such that performing
spike-recovery studies would be problematic due to limitations in
the dynamic range. Using dry, ground stinging nettle tissue, terpenoid
spike recoveries of at least 70% were achieved, with 27 out of 30
terpenes and terpenoids reaching 80–108% at 10 ppm (Table 2). At the evaluated
mid and high spike-recovery concentrations (125 and 400 ppm, respectively),
the spike-recovery data ranged from 82 to 104% for all analytes, except
for (−)-caryophyllene oxide, which has a high concentration
spike recovery of 129% (Table 2). MDLs for all analytes were less than 4 ppm in the plant
(40 ppm in the vial), and MRLs were verified at 10 ppm in the plant
(100 pm in the vial) for 50 mg of plant material (Table 2). Lower MRLs could be achieved
for many analytes, but given the expected concentrations in cannabis
and industrial hemp, it was not necessary to fully optimize this statistically
verified reporting limit. All of the method validation data reported
herein demonstrate the suitability of the method for the intended
goal of quantitating terpenoids.

As a relatively new market
segment, there is currently a dearth
of proficiency testing and/or certified reference materials for cannabis
and industrial hemp. This is especially true for terpenoids that,
unlike cannabinoids or pesticides, are not faced with any regulatory
restrictions regarding their absolute concentrations. The absence
of these materials makes it challenging to demonstrate the accuracy
of an analytical method for a broad range of terpenoids—a new
program exists in the United States for hemp flower, but the number
of terpene values provided is limited to ten. To provide a better
assessment of method performance for all terpenes and terpenoids evaluated
herein, a cross-validation approach was utilized to verify method
accuracy. Since the presence of incurred terpenoids was not a concern
for the cross-validation, hops (Humulus lupulus L. flower), a close phylogenetic relative of the family Cannabaceae
(i.e., cannabis), was used.

The method used for the cross-validation
is an ISO/IEC 17025 accredited
method for quantitating terpenes in plant material based on a hexane
extraction, followed by direct analysis of the organic extract using
GC–tandem mass spectrometry (method validation parameters were
consistent with those reported herein for the high-temperature headspace
method; Table S5). In addition to being
accredited, this method has also passed several rounds of proficiency
testing for terpenes in hemp oil. While not an exact matrix match,
these results do provide strong support for the accuracy of the method
as a benchmark. When comparing analytes above the respective MRLs
for each method, a correlation matrix was obtained that demonstrated
the accuracy of the high-temperature headspace method developed herein
(Figure 3A).

Method Validation For e-Juices and Related Vaping Products
The original focus of this method development project was on the
quantitation of terpenes in plant material. Paralleling our method
development efforts in plant material were reports coming out about
the safety of e-cigarettes and related vaping products intended to
be inhaled after high-temperature vaporization.18,20,31 E-juices are generally formulated in a mixture
of glycerol and propylene glycol, with other common ingredients, including
nicotine, caffeine, and flavoring agents (i.e., terpenes).32 Given our finding that glycerol was a suitable
matrix for the high-temperature headspace quantitation of terpenes,
it was decided that the scope of this method should be extended to
include the quantitation of terpenes in e-juices and related products.
Understanding the terpene concentrations is likely to become a critical
regulatory issue, as it has been documented that flavoring agents
can decompose during consumer use of e-cigarettes to produce potentially
harmful breakdown products.18,33−35 Since nicotine is frequently included in e-juice formulations, it
was also included in the expansion of the analytical scope of the
method reported herein (Figure 4).

Terpene/terpenoid and nicotine peaks were extracted with m/z 93 and 84, respectively. Numbers represent structures
depicted in Figure 1.

A mixture of glycerol and propylene
glycol (1:1 ratio) was used
as a surrogate for typical e-juice matrices to develop the method
for terpene/terpenoid and nicotine quantitation. Using this mixture,
terpenoid spike recoveries of at least 93% were obtained (Table 3). At the evaluated
mid and high spike-recovery concentrations in e-juice (75 and 250
ppm for terpenoids, and 7.5 and 25 mg/mL for nicotine), the spike-recovery
data ranged from 83 to 104% for all analytes. MDLs for all terpenoids
and nicotine were less than 3 ppm for terpenoids and 0.1 mg/mL for
nicotine, and MRLs were verified at 10 ppm for terpenoids and 0.5
mg/mL for nicotine (Table 3). These method performance parameters are all suitable for
the intended scope, with typical nicotine concentrations in e-juices
ranging mostly from 1 to 30 mg/mL.36,37

a Concentrations are presented based
on e-juice volume. MDL: method detection limit. MRL: method reporting
limit. The calibration ranges for terpenoids were from 1 to 300 ppm
(10–3000 ppb in the vial), except for trans-β-ocimene, linalool, citronellol, and geraniol (5–300
ppm, or 50–3000 ppb in the vial). The calibration range for
nicotine was from 0.25 to 30 mg/mL (2.5–300 μg/mL in
the vial).

b Unit: ppm for
terpenoids, and mg/mL
for nicotine.

c Concentration:
Low-, mid-, and high-level
concentrations for terpenoids are 10, 75, and 250 ppm, respectively.
Low-, mid-, and high-level concentrations for nicotine are 1, 7.5,
and 25 mg/mL, respectively.

Using this method, the terpenoids of interest were quantitated
in commercially available terpenoid distillates and nicotine-containing
e-juices. Owing, again, to the lack of suitable proficiency testing
and/or certified reference materials, a cross-validation approach
(using the same method as reported for cross-validation of terpene
quantitation in plant material) was utilized to evaluate method accuracy
for the terpenoid distillates. The data produced were in excellent
agreement (Figure 3B), demonstrating the applicability of this method for the quantitation
of terpenoids in e-juices and other glycerol-based vaporization products.

In addition to terpenoids, the method reported here is suitable
for the analysis of nicotine (Figure 4, Table 3)—a bioactive compound for which concerns about the combined
neurological impact with cannabis38,39 has been raised.
In 2018, the Canadian Task Force on Cannabis Legalization and Regulation
also recommended that mixed products, including those containing both
cannabis and nicotine and/or caffeine, should be prohibited.40 In this context, this method could be used as
a regulatory tool to screen for nicotine, while at the same time quantitating
(or profiling) the terpenoids present.

Conclusions
The
headspace GC–MS analysis method presented here facilitates
the precise quantitation of select terpenes and terpenoids in plant
materials and vaping liquids with minimal sample preparation. Sample
matrices (plant tissues and liquid extracts) that do not affect method
performance and critical nonterpenoid components of e-juices, such
as nicotine, can also be included in the analysis.

Materials and
Methods
General Details
For dry plant tissue, the sample was
homogenized using a commercial coffee grinder. Samples and standards
were weighed on a VWR-164AC analytical balance (VWR) and analyzed
using a TriPlus 500 GC Headspace Autosampler and a TRACE 1300 GC coupled
with an ISQ 7000 Single Quadrupole MS System (Thermo Fisher).

Where cross-validation was required, samples were also analyzed using
a TriPlus RSH Autosampler, TRACE 1310 GC, and a TSQ 9000 Triple Quadrupole
GC–MS/MS system equipped with an advanced electron ionization
(AEI) source (Thermo Fisher).

Plant Materials, e-Juices,
Reagents, and Chemicals
Dry stinging nettle (Urtica dioica L.) was purchased from Westpoint Naturals
(British Columbia, Canada).
Cannabis terpenoid mixtures were purchased from Vapeur Terp (California),
and e-juices were products of Canada Vape Lab (Ontario, Canada), Illusions
Vape (Ontario, Canada), and Premium Labs (British Columbia, Canada).

Anhydrous, ACS-grade sodium chloride, high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC)-grade solvents (water, glycerol, DMSO, DMF, hexanes, and tetradecane),
and nicotine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Ontario, Canada) and
used as received. Cannabis terpenoid standards were acquired from
Restek (California): Cannabis Terpenes Standard 1 contains 2500 μg/mL
(−)-α-bisabolol, camphene, δ-3-carene, (−)-β-caryophyllene,
geraniol, (−)-guaiol, α-humulene, p-cymene,
(−)-isopulegol, (+)-limonene, linalool, β-myrcene, nerolidol
(cis and trans), β-ocimene
(cis and trans), α-pinene,
(−)-β-pinene, α-terpinene, γ-terpinene, and
terpinolene; Cannabis Terpenes Standard 2 contains 2500 μg/mL
(−)-caryophyllene oxide, and 1,8-cineole (eucalyptol). In addition,
analytical standards of linalool oxides, citronellol, nerol, β-damascone,
β-damascenone, and α-terpineol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
and used as received. Mixed terpenoid and nicotine calibration samples
(5–800 μg/mL) were prepared in tetradecane and stored
at −20 °C for up to three months (Tables S2 and S3). We used (±)-linalool-d3 (CDN Isotopes, Quebec, Canada) as an
internal standard. A 400 μg/mL linalool-d3 stock solution was prepared in tetradecane
and stored at −20 °C for up to 12 months.

GC–MS
Analysis
Water, brine (saturated NaCl solution
[stored under ambient conditions]), DMSO, DMF, or glycerol was used
as the headspace carrier solvent. Ground plant materials (50 mg),
e-juices (50 μL), and cannabis terpenoid mixtures (25 μL)
were added to a 5 mL of headspace carrier solvent in 20 mL headspace
sampling vials (Chromatographic Specialties, Ontario, Canada) sealed
with an 18 mm (diameter) × 1.524 mm (thickness) polytetrafluoroethylene
(PTFE)/silicone gas-tight septa (Supelco, Pennsylvania). Vials were
incubated and agitated at the “fast” setting for 15
min at temperatures ranging from 85 to 220 °C. Vial pressure
was set to 100 kPa with an equilibration time of 12 s. The samples
were then injected using a 1 mL loop with an equilibration time of
30 s and an injection time of 30 s, with sample loop temperatures
ranging from 85 to 220 °C.

All samples were analyzed using
a 30 m × 0.25 mm × 1.4 μm TG-624SilMS capillary GC
column (Thermo Fisher). Helium (99.999%) was used as carrier gas at
1.5 mL/min. The inlet temperature was set at 125 °C with a septum
purge flow of 20 mL/min and a split ratio of 100:1 (unless otherwise
noted). The GC oven temperature gradient started at 60 °C for
30 s, followed by a ramp of 50 °C/min to 130 °C and 3-min
hold, another increase to 140 °C at 5 °C/min, and finally
to 280 °C at 22 °C/min and held for 3 min. The total gradient
run time was 16.5 min. The temperatures of the MS transfer line, electron
impact source, and ISQ transfer line were 250, 300, and 300 °C,
respectively. Data were acquired in either scan or selected ion monitoring
(SIM) modes (Table S1) and analyzed using
the Chromeleon Chromatography Data System (Thermo Fisher; version
7).

For cross-validation purposes, 0.2 g ground plant materials
were
extracted with 20 mL hexanes in a 50 mL conical tube by shaking for
1 min, followed by incubation in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min and
subsequent 10 s vortex. The sample was then centrifuged for 5 min
at 3000g, and the clear supernatant was diluted 1000-fold
for liquid-injection GC–MS/MS analysis. The GC–MS/MS
instrument included a TSQ 9000 AEI triple quadrupole MS coupled with
a TRACE 1310 GC. One microliter of the sample was injected by a TriPlusTM RHS autosampler at an inlet temperature of 220 °C and
chromatographed with helium (99.999%) as the carrier gas (1.5 mL/min)
on a TG-624SilMS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm ID 1.4 μm).
The same oven temperature gradient, as described above, was used,
and the split flow was 6 mL/min. MS transfer line and ion source temperatures
were 250 and 300 °C, respectively. Data were acquired in selected
reaction monitoring (SRM) mode (Table S2)

Method Validation
Method validation in plant tissue
was performed using plant material fortified with select terpenes
and terpenoids (vide infra). Each headspace vial included 5 mL glycerol,
25 μL internal standard (400 μg/mL linalool-d3), 25 μL of the fortification
(or solvent as method blank), and 50 mg ground, dry stinging nettle
where applicable.

Nine calibration levels were prepared at final
concentrations of 25–4000 ng/mL in the vial (Table S3). Calibration functions for all analytes were fit
to linear or quadratic curves, with inverse concentration weighting
applied to all analytes. The dynamic range was calculated as the logarithm
of the high calibration concentration divided by the low calibration
concentration for each analyte. Method detection limits (MDL) were
evaluated by determining the minimum measured concentration of an
analyte at 25–200 ng/mL in the vial (2.5–20 ppm in plant
sample; n = 7 over three days) that could be reported
as distinct from the method blank with 99% confidence. The method
reporting limit (MRL) for each analyte was verified using precision
and accuracy specifications as outlined by the United States Environmental
Protection Agency.41 MRLs were established
at a fortification concentration of 25–200 ng/mL in the vial
(n = 7). Carry-over was assessed by comparing the
raw area response of each analyte in the high calibration sample (4000
ng/mL in the vial) to that of a method blank analyzed immediately
after—an area response ratio < 0.1% in the method blank
was accepted as suitable carry-over. Repeatability (n = 5; 1250 ng/mL in the vial or 125 ppm in the plant sample), intermediate
precision (n = 17 over 3 days; 1250 ng/mL in the
vial or 125 ppm in the plant sample), and method recoveries (n = 5; 3500 ng/mL in the vial or 350 ppm in the plant sample)
were also evaluated.

For vaping liquid (e-juice) method validation,
each headspace vial
included 5 mL glycerol, 25 μL internal standard (400 μg/mL
linalool-d3), 25 μL
of the fortification (or solvent as method blank), and 50 μL
glycerol:propylene glycol (1:1 v/v) as a surrogate vaping liquid where
applicable. The calibration range included nine levels of 10–3000
ng/mL and 1–300 mg/mL for terpenoids and nicotine, respectively
(Table S4). MDLs and MRLs were evaluated
by identifying the minimum concentration of an analyte at 10–100
ng/mL (terpenoid) or 1–10 mg/mL (nicotine) in the vial (1–10
ppm terpenoids or 0.1–1 mg/mL nicotine in e-juice). Repeatability
and intermediate precision were established at fortification concentrations
of 750 ng/mL terpenoids and 75 mg/mL nicotine in the vial (or 75 ppm
terpenoids and 7.5 mg/mL nicotine in surrogate e-juice). All other
parameters and settings were identical to those of the plant tissue
method validation (vide supra).
