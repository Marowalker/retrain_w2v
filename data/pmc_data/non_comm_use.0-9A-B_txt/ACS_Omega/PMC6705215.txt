Work
function changes, or vacuum-level shifts (ΔVLS),
in Al(001) surfaces by the adsorption of thin layers composed
of tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminum (Alq3) and/or LiF
are theoretically investigated. First-principles calculations reasonably
reproduce experimentally obtained ΔVLS values, enabling
us to discuss the underlying mechanism. Dipole moment of Alq3 and interfacial charge rearrangement (Pauli push-back effect) are
the main reasons for ΔVLS at Al(001)–Alq3 and Al(001)–LiF interfaces, respectively. For a stacked
Al(001)–LiF–Alq3 layer configuration, theory
suggests a more complicated picture, which takes charge rearrangement
between LiF and Alq3 layers into account, than a simple
sum rule of dipole contributions from the two layers.

1 Introduction
Tuning
energy levels at electrode–organic-layer interfaces
is of great importance in organic electronics, especially in the field
of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) since this critically affects driving voltage, efficiency, stability,
and so on.1,2 A practical strategy for improving device
performance is to insert thin layers of metal-doped organic molecules,
halides, and/or oxides between the cathode and the electron transport
layer.3−6 These intermediate layers change the electrode Fermi level with
respect to the conduction band of the organic layer, lowering the
energy barrier to overcome. Such a change, namely, the vacuum-level
shift (ΔVLS), has been experimentally verified by
work function measurements using photoelectron spectroscopy (PES)
techniques.7−10 However, interpretation from a theoretical standpoint is not yet
enough and will be desirable for providing further insight into the
underlying mechanism.

First-principles calculations based on
density functional theory
(DFT)11,12 are suitable for this purpose: they have
actually been utilized for electronic structure analysis of surfaces
and interfaces in a broad research area.13−17 It is well confirmed that DFT calculations can successfully
reproduce work functions for various kinds of metal surfaces.18,19 Nevertheless, the computation of ΔVLS at interfaces
is often difficult since the property is strongly dependent on the
surface–layer distance and the structure of molecular adsorption.
Conventional approximate DFT implementations tend to overestimate
the surface–layer distance due to poor description of weak
van der Waals (vdW) interactions.20 Meanwhile,
thanks to the recent development of first-principles theory for the
treatment of vdW interactions,21,22 more reliable interface
structure–electronic property relationship is now feasible.

In the present study, we focus on adsorption structures and the
corresponding electronic properties for Al(001)–tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminum
(Alq3) and Al(001)–LiF interfaces as well as Al(001)–LiF–Alq3 multilayer interfaces. Alq3 is a typical molecular
system in the OLED field;23−25 its electronic structures and
related properties have been studied both experimentally7−10,26,27 and theoretically.28−32 LiF is one of the standard materials used as a buffer layer in OLED
devices.4 Multilayer/mixed-layer configurations
are an important class of device architecture for practical OLED applications.33,34 In basic research, stacked layer structures, particularly Al/LiF/Alq3 configurations, are adopted to investigate detailed interface
characteristics.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the theoretical
background of work function shift analysis. Section 3 provides computed results of the interface
systems listed above and discusses possible contributions of ΔVLS based on the analysis approach of Heimel et al.35,36Section 4 summarizes
our overall findings. Our computational scheme is presented in Section 5.

2 Theoretical Background: The Bond Dipole (BD)
Molecular/thin-layer
adsorption generally perturbs the electronic
properties of metal surfaces, modifying the work functions, relative
energy levels between the metal and adsorbed layers, etc. Looking
into charge redistribution is a useful guideline for understanding
the modification mechanism. Electron density difference before and
after adsorption along the z (parallel to the surface
normal) direction, Δρ(z), is given by eqs 1 1a  (ads = Alq3 or LiF) 1b  where ρads+Al/ρAlq3+LiF+Al is the plane-integrated electron density
of a total system; ρads and ρAl are
those for isolated adsorbate species and clean Al(001), respectively,
for the atomic positions of the adsorbate–substrate interface
geometry. By definition, positive (negative) Δρ(z) means increase (decrease) in the number of electrons.
The displaced charge,37Q(z), calculated by eq 2 2  expresses how
charge is rearranged as a result
of Al–adsorbate interactions. Then, based on the one-dimensional
Poisson equation (eq 3) 3  (ε0 is the vacuum permittivity),
integrating Q(z) 4  (A is the area of the xy plane) yields net change in the potential energy V(z) or the bond dipole (BD).35−37

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Alq3 on Al(001)
We start
with the analysis of Al(001)–Alq3 interfaces. Although
Alq3 has isomers with the facial and meridional (mer) types, we focused only on the mer isomer
that is thermodynamically more stable.38−40 Our ΔVLS can be considered an upper limit of experimentally achievable value
in the following two aspects. The one is that ΔVLS may be approximately determined in the monolayer scale; Yokoyama
et al.,8 for instance, observed little
thickness dependence in the range of 0.5–5 nm. The other is
that model Alq3 layers are densely packed since the lattice
constants in the x and y directions
are close to the size of Alq3 (∼1 nm)

We first
study a situation in which two of three O atoms in the two 8-hydroquinolinato
ligands are directed toward the Al(001) surface. Following Yanagisawa
et al.,31,32 we specify this configuration as the “mer/up” configuration. Figure 1 shows an optimized adsorption structure
at the Al(001)–Alq3 interface. The two O atoms in
the two 8-hydroquinolinato groups form chemical bonds with surface
Al atoms (Al–O bond lengths of 2.02 and 1.97 Å); instead,
bond lengths between the O atoms and the Al atom in the Alq3 molecule are elongated by 0.09–0.13 Å. This bond formation
pulls bonded Al atoms in the Al(001) surface toward the Alq3 layer, distorting the surface structure of Al(001). By contrast,
the remaining Al–O bond is hardly influenced by the adsorption.
As a result of Al–O bond creation, a relatively large adsorption
energy (ΔE, eq 5 in Section 5) of −1.45 eV is gained. An electrostatic potential
profile for the mer/up Al(001)–Alq3 interface model is illustrated in Figure 2. There exist two (left and right) flat regions
away from the slab, which may be considered the vacuum levels and
potential oscillations originating from atoms in the system. The left-hand-side
vacuum level is located at 4.28 eV relative to the Fermi level. From
our model setting, this value is regarded as the work function of
a clean Al(001) surface and is in fair agreement with the ones reported
by other groups and experimentally determined work functions.18,19 On the other hand, the position of the right-hand-side vacuum level
is lower in energy than the left-hand-side one by 1.23 eV. This downward
shift (ΔVLS) is caused by the adsorption of Alq3. The computed ΔVLS of −1.23 eV is
in reasonable agreement with PES results (−1.4 to −0.7
eV)7−10 as well as previous DFT results.31,32

Figure 2 Electrostatic potential profile for the mer/up
Al(001)–Alq3 interface. Flat energy regions near
the edges correspond to vacuum levels in our model. The zero energy
is set at the Fermi level of the system. In this setting, the left-hand-side
vacuum-level position (width between the solid and dotted lines) is
considered the work function of clean Al(001). The position of the
right-hand-side vacuum-level relative to that of the left one is the
vacuum-level shift ΔVLS.

To gain deeper insight into the shift mechanism, we divide ΔVLS into three possible contributions: (i) BD; (ii) vacuum-level
difference due to the distortion of the Al surface [Δ(Al)];
and (iii) vacuum-level difference coming from the dipole of Alq3 [Δ(Alq3)].

Contribution (i): A ΔρAlq3 profile
along the surface normal is shown in Figure 3a (top). Significant oscillation behavior
is confirmed only around the Al/Alq3 interface, especially
between the rightmost Al layer and the bonded oxygen atoms of the
8-hydroquinolinato groups, indicating the locality of electronic structure
change. Figure 3a (middle)
illustrates displaced charge Q(z) obtained by numerical integration of eq 2. From left to right, the Q(z) value increases to reach 0.18e, which suggests that the Al surface side of the interface is negatively
charged. After the second maximum (0.18e) arising
from the formation of chemical bonds, Q(z) decreases to return to ∼0. Since change in Q(z) is limited within the interface, net electron
transfer between Al(001) and Alq3 is modest. This interpretation
is also supported from an electronic structure viewpoint. The projected
density of states (PDOS) profile for Alq3 is given in Figure 3b. A peak corresponding
to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is located higher
in energy than the Fermi level by 0.20 eV, which indicates that the
LUMO is in weak resonance with the Fermi energy. Figure 3a (bottom), a profile of V(z), shows that the BD contribution moves
the vacuum level down by 0.40 eV.

green dotted lines correspond to the positions of the rightmost Al(001)
layer and the Al atom in Alq3. Two maximum values of Q(z) are also given. (b) Projected density
of states (PDOS) of Alq3 for the mer/up
Al(001)–Alq3 interface. The zero energy, indicated
by the black dashed line, is set at the Fermi level EF. Peak position closest to EF is included in the plot. (c) Electrostatic potential profiles for
clean Al(001) (top), Alq3 (middle), and BD (bottom, same
as that given in (a)). Atomic positions of the former two structures
were extracted from the optimized total interface system.

Contribution (ii): We calculated difference in vacuum levels
using
the Al slab extracted from the relaxed Al(001)–Alq3 interface structure to estimate a distortion-induced level shift.43 As is revealed from the electrostatic potential
profile in Figure 3c (top), left and right vacuum levels are essentially the same, Δ(Al)
= −0.05 eV. We can therefore conclude that this contribution
is negligible.

Contribution (iii): Infinite molecular layers
divide spaces into
two regions with different vacuum levels.35 In our model here, the adsorbed Alq3 corresponds to a
dipole layer. As is evident from Figure 3c (middle), the electrostatic potential profile
of the Alq3 layer experiences a significantly large drop
of Δ(Alq3) = −0.78 eV.

The sum of the
three contributions (−0.40 + −0.05
+ −0.78 = −1.23 eV) matches ΔVLS of
the total system (−1.23 eV), as expected from previous studies.35−37 The above analyses further clarify the relative importance of the
contributions in the mer/up situation: dipole of
Alq3 > BD ≫ Al distortion.

By their comprehensive
calculations on Al/Alq3 interfaces,
Yanagisawa et al.31,32 exemplified significant dependence
of ΔVLS on adsorbate configurations. In the present
study, we research electronic properties in another Al(001)–Alq3 interface structure, for which no O–Al(001) bond is
formed (denoted “mer/down” configuration).
An optimized configuration is shown in Figure 4. Neither O nor N atom forms a chemical bond
with surface Al atoms, showing that Alq3 is adsorbed via
vdW interactions in this configuration. A ΔVLS value
for the mer/down configuration is estimated to be
−0.23 eV, less significant than that for the mer/up configuration (ΔVLS = −1.23 eV). This
trend is in line with previous findings.31,32 Dividing ΔVLS into the three contributions [BD,
Δ(Al), and Δ(Alq3)], again, gives us more information
on the difference. The computed shift values are summarized in Table 1 (charge density/potential
profiles and PDOS for the mer/down interface are
shown in Figures S1 and S2, respectively,
in the Supporting Information). The contribution of Al surface distortion
is negligible with Δ(Al) ∼ 0 eV. A BD value in the mer/down configuration (−0.28 eV) is similar to that
in the mer/up one, although a clear chemical bond
is not formed for the former case. On the other hand, Δ(Alq3) is significantly different depending on the direction of
the dipole moment of Alq3: a positive value of 0.06 eV
is predicted in the mer/down configuration, in sharp
contrast to Δ(Alq3) = −0.78 eV in the mer/up case. The sum of the three contributions well reproduces
ΔVLS = −0.23 eV; hence, we verify that the
main cause of the difference in the vacuum-level shift is from the
dipole of Alq3.

mer/up	–0.40	–0.05	–0.78	
a Results for the mer/up configuration
are also included.

We additionally
considered a possible effect of orientation-dependent
orbital energy difference (intrinsic surface dipole44). Energies of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)
and LUMO for isolated Alq3 monolayers are listed in Table 2. From the difference
in the HOMO level between the two configurations (0.06 eV), we anticipate
that orientation dependence on the ionization energy will be small.
By contrast, the LUMO level for the mer/up monolayer
is lower in energy than that for the mer/down by
0.41 eV, which may contribute to enhanced LUMO resonance with the
Fermi energy in the mer/up situation.

Systems
 	εHOMO (eV)	εLUMO (eV)	
mer/up	–4.82	–3.22	
mer/down	–4.76	–2.81	
Because Alq3 binds
to Al(001) more strongly in the mer/up configuration
(ΔE = −1.45
eV) than in mer/down (ΔE =
−1.10 eV), the former should be a dominant configuration. Thus,
we theoretically figure out large ΔVLS at the Al/Alq3 interface.

3.2 Thin LiF Layer on Al(001)
In this
Section, we theoretically explore the effects of LiF on the electronic
properties of the Al(001) surface assuming full coverage. Hereinafter,
we specify a 3 × 3 LiF sheet with the number of layers of n by LiF(nL). We consider a situation where
F atoms in LiF are located at the on-top sites of Al(001), nearly
the same as that of Prada and co-workers.18 The lattice constant of LiF (4.03 Å)45 is close to that of Al (4.049 Å);46 hence, we expect negligible artifact coming from lattice mismatch.
Also, typical deposition thickness of LiF is in the range of 1 nm,
so our setting of n of 1–6 (n = 1, 2, 4, or 6) is a valid choice.

An optimized structure
and corresponding electrostatic potential profile of an Al(001)–LiF(2L)
interface model is drawn in Figure 5. Calculated distance between the Al surface and the
LiF layer of 2.8–2.9 Å indicates that LiF tends to bind
to the Al(001) surface via vdW interaction. The left-hand-side vacuum
level of 4.29 eV is, as expected, nearly the same as that in the Al(001)–Alq3 case. The ΔVLS value of −0.96 eV
is in line with PES data previously reported.7

potential profile for the Al(001)–LiF(2L)
interface. The zero energy is set at the Fermi level of the system.
A dotted line corresponds to the position of the left-hand-side vacuum
level (clean Al(001) surface).

We next analyze components of ΔVLS for the Al(001)–LiF(2L)
interface. To this end, we divide the deposition process into two
hypothetical steps: (i) the adsorption of a geometry-relaxed LiF layer
onto clean Al(001) and (ii) subsequent structural reorientation at
the LiF–Al interface. First, in step (i), we compare two situations
with the same (independently optimized) Al slab and LiF(2L) structures
but different settings of Al–LiF distance L: L = 2.9 Å, taken from our optimized separation
length, and L = 3.3 Å, nearly the same as that
of Prada and co-workers.18 When the vdW
interaction is considered, the former (L = 2.9 Å,
adsorption energy (eq 5 in Section 5) ΔE = −2.73 eV) is energetically more stable than the
latter (ΔE = −2.43 eV) by 0.30 eV. Profiles
of electron density difference ΔρLiF and the
corresponding potential energy changes are shown in Figure 6. Computed ΔVLS values, BDs, as well as the maxima of Q(z) (Qmax values) are listed
in Table 3. Nearly
symmetric ΔρLiF oscillations are observed only
around the Al/LiF interface region, indicating limited charge redistribution.
The change in the sign of ΔρLiF shows the polarities
of negative and positive, respectively, on the Al and LiF sides. Even
though Al(001) and LiF in the relaxed geometries generate essentially
no difference in the left and right vacuum levels (absolute values
less than 0.01 eV), nonzero ΔVLS is obtained as a
consequence of charge displacement and concomitantly induced BD. Analysis
here also reveals that decreasing L enhances Qmax, accordingly strengthening BD and ΔVLS. Worth mentioning is that our estimate ΔVLS = −0.59 eV at L = 3.3 Å is comparable
to that of Prada et al. (−0.47 eV).18 Next, in step (ii), calculated properties for the optimized Al(001)–LiF(2L)
interface are reported in Table 4. As expected from the Al(001)–Alq3 systems, Δ(Al) is very small. Interfacial charge shift is
larger for the relaxed configuration (0.61e) than
for the nonrelaxed one (0.47e), and thus more pronounced
BD is generated at the optimized Al(001)–LiF(2L) interface.
However, structural change of LiF increases the right vacuum level,
the Δ(LiF) value being drastically changed from ∼0 to
+0.60 eV. In total, the sum of the three contributions BD + Δ(Al)
+ Δ(LiF) = −0.95 eV is essentially the same as ΔVLS = −0.96 eV of the whole system. We find from the
above discussions that the main mechanism of ΔVLS is a large BD (also known as the Pauli push-back effect2) and deformation of LiF may drastically modulate
ΔVLS due to change in Δ(LiF).

a Qmax values
for the interface systems are depicted as well.

We conducted the same analysis in
other LiF layer thickness cases,
LiF(nL) with n = 1, 4, and 6. Profiles
of ΔρLiF are summarized in Figure 7a. Electrostatic potential
profiles for LiF(1L), LiF(4L), and LiF(6L) are presented in the Supporting Information (Figure S3). We see oscillation behavior only at the interface in all
systems, corroborating the locality of electronic structure change.
Electronic properties related to ΔVLS are then reported
in Table 4. Adsorption
energies are also included as reference. We observe the same trends
for the interfaces of n = 2, 4, and 6: large BD,
essentially no contribution from Al distortion, and a positive vacuum-level
shift for LiF layers. The Al(001)–LiF(1L) interface has a similar,
but not the same, feature to the other cases. At the Al(001)–LiF(1L)
interface, F atoms in the LiF monolayer are likely to form chemical
bonds with interfacial Al atoms with bond lengths of ∼1.96
Å (see Figure 7b). This bond formation induces stronger BD as well as more pronounced
Δ(LiF) due to sheet deformation.

density difference profiles along surface
normal for LiF with different thicknesses. Label “nL” means the number of LiF layers. The length of the arrow
corresponds to the scale of 1.0 e/Å. (b) Optimized structure
of the Al(001)–LiF(1L) interface. Bond lengths are shown in
units of Å.

From Table 4, we
can see that the thickness of the LiF layer has an insignificant effect
on ΔVLS. However, inconsistent with our results,
some experimental studies indicate that ΔVLS is changed
according to deposition thickness. As a possible reason for the discrepancy
between theory and experiment, we anticipate surface coverage. Notably,
both BD and Δ(LiF) are easily influenced by Al–LiF distance
and LiF layer structure as we have demonstrated before. Our calculations
assume that ideally flat thin LiF layers fully cover the Al(001) surface,
which is difficult to experimentally realize. This hypothesis is also
supported by a large discrepancy between literature ΔVLS data (−1.6 to −0.4 eV),7,8,10 which suggests that ΔVLS is readily
affected by the experimental condition in this instance.

3.3 Al(001)–LiF–Alq3 Multilayer
Multilayer stack structures are more realistic in device applications.
Based on the findings given in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, we
investigate the electronic properties of Al(001)–LiF(2L)–Alq3 multilayer systems.

Optimized structures of multilayer
models in the mer/up and mer/down
configurations are given in Figure 8. For the mer/up configuration, two
of three Al–O bonds in Alq3 are elongated accompanying
the formation of chemical bonds with Li atoms in the LiF sheet, while
the other Al–O bond length is hardly changed by 0.01 Å.
The bond deformation is, however, less significant compared to the
Al(001)–Alq3 case. On the other hand, neither obvious
chemical bond creation nor large distortion of Al–O bond lengths
are recognized for the mer/down configuration. Calculated
adsorption energies using eq 6 (in Section 5) indicate that the mer/up configuration is more
likely (ΔE = −1.60 eV for mer/up; ΔE = −1.19 eV for mer/down) as in the Al(001)–Alq3 system.

Figure 8 Optimized Al–O
bond lengths of the mer/up
(left) and mer/down (right) configurations of Al(001)–LiF(2L)–Alq3 interfaces. Values in parentheses are bond lengths of isolated
Alq3. Interfacial Li–O bond distances are included.
Lengths are shown in units of Å.

We first scrutinize the electronic properties of the mer/up situation. Potential profiles for the mer/up
structure are shown in Figure 9 (left). If we assume a simple combination of Al(001)–LiF(2L)
(ΔVLS = −0.96 eV) and an infinite dipole layer
of mer/up-Alq3 monolayer (Δ(Alq3) = −0.78 eV) with a BD value of −0.17 eV (value
for a LiF(2L)–Alq3 interface extracted from the
optimized three-layer structure), we obtain an estimate of ΔVLS of around −2 eV; nevertheless, Figure 9a exhibits a smaller value
(ΔVLS = −1.55 eV) than this expectation. To
garner more understanding of this discrepancy, we separately investigate
work function shifts. Some interesting features are inferred from Figure 9b (left). As discussed
in Section 3.2, a
positive Q(z) peak shows that relative
polarities of the Al and LiF sides are negative and positive, respectively,
at the Al(001)–LiF(2L) interface. This charge displacement
accordingly causes a sharp drop of V(z) at z ∼ 0 Å. A negative Q region on the whole LiF(2L) sheet means that LiF(2L) is positively
charged; conversely, the Alq3 molecule is negatively charged
since the Q value returns to 0 around the molecular
region. This charge rearrangement pushes V upward.
The negative and positive shifts therefore cancel out and generate
an exceptionally small BD of −0.04 eV on the whole system.
Calculated Δ(Al) and Δ(Alq3) are expectable
values from the analysis in the Al(001)–Alq3 interface,
while Δ(LiF) has a negative value (−0.70 eV) possibly
due to layer distortion. Summing up the contributions, −0.04
+ −0.02 + −0.78 + −0.70 = −1.54 eV, well
matches the ΔVLS value of −1.55 eV.

zero energies are set at the Fermi level of the total
system. The left work functions are 4.29 eV for both situations. (b)

and net change in the electrostatic potential V (bottom):

green dotted lines are placed at the Al/LiF and LiF/Alq3 interfaces as a guide to the eye. A negative Q region,
suggestive of electron transfer from LiF to Alq3, is marked
by the red dashed circle.

We move on to the case of mer/down Al(001)–LiF(2L)–Alq3. An electrostatic potential profile for this system is illustrated
in Figure 9a (right).
The ΔVLS value of −1.16 eV is smaller than
that for the mer/up configuration. Plots related
to electronic structure change, ΔρAlq3+LiF, Q(z), and V(z) are shown in Figure 9b (right) for detailed analysis. Also, difference
in vacuum level for each component and BD are summarized in Table 5. Symmetric ΔρAlq3+LiF oscillation and a positive Q(z) peak (Qmax = 0.60e), which are caused by interfacial charge distribution
between Al(001) and LiF(2L), explain the large drop of V(z) (−1.49 eV) at z ∼
0 Å. Contrary to the mer/up case, charge transfer
between LiF and Alq3 is insignificant (absolute value less
than 0.01e), and consequently, the potential change
at the LiF(2L)–Alq3 interface is very small (−0.005
eV). Hence, the total BD is estimated to be −1.49 eV. Also
in the mer/down case, Δ(Al) and Δ(Alq3) are normal from previous discussions. Besides, the Δ(LiF)
value is equivalent to that in the Al(001)–LiF interface because
of no structural deformation of LiF upon Alq3 adsorption.
The ΔVLS value is reasonably reproduced using a simple
sum rule ΔVLS ∼ Δ(Al) + Δ(LiF)
+ Δ(Alq3) + BD.

Energies of the HOMO and LUMO for isolated Alq3 monolayers
in Al/LiF/Alq3 are presented in Table 6. Besides, shown in Figure 10a,b are PDOS profiles for the Alq3 and LiF regions, respectively. Stronger resonance at the Fermi level
is indicated for the mer/up configuration from the
left panel as well as the LUMO energies, which is also found in the
Al/Alq3 case. Contrarily, we observe little energy shift
due to the adsorption of Alq3 in the PDOS for LiF. These
findings reveal that difference in potential evolutions for the two
configurations is caused by the modulation of the electronic structure,
especially the LUMOs, of Alq3.

We mention here a validity of using semilocal
DFT (see Section 5)
for the description
of charge rearrangement at our metal/dielectric/molecule interfaces.
In their seminal work, Hofmann et al.47 suggested that hybrid Hartree–Fock-DFT is necessary to describe
the integer electron transfer mechanism for Cu/NaCl/tetracyanoethene
(TCNE). Integer electron transfer to the molecule is energetically
feasible in their case because TCNE is a strong electron acceptor
with the LUMO level lying below the Fermi level of Cu. In our case,
however, integer electron transfer is less likely since the LUMO level
of Alq3 (Tables 2 and 6) lies above the Fermi level
of Al. Fractional electron transfer, which can be reasonably treated
within semilocal DFT, may be more plausible in our Al/LiF/Alq3 situation; we therefore expect that our computational framework
should give us at least qualitatively reasonable description.

The mer/up interface is predicted to be more preferable
configuration in terms of ΔE. This is also
supported by the fact that the calculated ΔVLS for
the mer/up configuration is in good agreement with
experimental ones.7,8 A picture of a simple sum is often
applied to the diagram of ΔVLS in multilayer systems.7−9 However, our analysis clearly points out a more complicated picture
depending on adsorption structures, where considering energy-level
alignments throughout the stack is necessary.48 Since the present computational scheme successfully explains the
work function changes of Al by Alq3 and LiF, our results
on various kinds of interface structure–electronic property
relationship would be useful for understanding the mechanisms of the
charge injections in OLEDs and to design better device structures.

4 Conclusions
Using first-principles calculations,
we have elucidated the work
function changes in Al(001) surfaces by the addition of thin layers
composed of Alq3 and/or LiF. Our theoretical study not
only reproduces findings already reported but also sheds light on
the underlying mechanism. Our calculations demonstrate that a predominant
factor determining ΔVLS at the Al(001)–Alq3 interface is the dipole moment of Alq3, while
at the Al(001)–LiF interface, interfacial charge rearrangement
(Pauli push-back effect) is the main contribution. We also find that
Δ(LiF) can be easily affected by the surface conditions. Our
first-principles analysis further suggests a complicated picture on
the mechanism of work function change in a stacked Al(001)–LiF–Alq3 layer configuration. In this stacked layer structure, the
contribution of BD decreases due to charge rearrangement between LiF
and Alq3, and accordingly, ΔVLS is approximately
described by a sum of dipole components. This picture is different
from the one commonly used, in a sense that the conventional sum rule
does not explicitly take the BD change into account. Deeper understanding
of electronic structures (e.g., energy-level alignments) of electrode
stacks will be increasingly sought in device engineering.48 We believe that first-principles calculations,
especially the ones in combination with the inclusion of vdW interactions
and the effective screening medium (ESM) method,49 should be very powerful for properly describing electronic
structures at interfaces in the field of organic electronics like
OLEDs and organic field-effect transistors.

5 Computational
Details
We represented an Al(001) surface by a repeated slab
model, employing
a six-layer, 3 × 3 supercell structure. The Al slab was placed
in a tetragonal unit cell with 12.147 Å × 12.147 Å
(x and y axes) × 48 Å
(z axis), where the x and y lengths of 12.147 Å were adopted from the lattice
constant of bulk face-centered cubic Al (4.049 Å).46 Of the two surfaces, the right-hand-side surface,
whose z component is located around the origin, was
defined by a surface on which Alq3 and/or LiF are deposited,
while the left-hand-side surface was kept clean. During geometry optimization,
three Al layers on the left-hand side were fixed at the bulk position,
whereas the other Al layers and deposited species were fully relaxed.
For the computation on an isolated Alq3 molecule, we used
a 30 Å cubic box.

We performed first-principles calculations
within the framework
of DFT using the PWSCF program, a part of the Quantum ESPRESSO package.50−52 Electronic structures were described by a combination of the GGA-PBE53 (general gradient approximation of Perdew, Burke,
and Ernzerhof) exchange-correlation functional, plane waves, and Vanderbilt
ultrasoft pseudopotentials.54 We set plane-wave
and augmented charge cutoff energies to 35 and 350 Ry, respectively,
and used the Marzari–Vanderbilt cold smearing55 with the broadening parameter of 0.01 Ry. In the projected
density of states calculations, we used the Gaussian smearing with
a 0.01-Ry broadening parameter. Electrons explicitly treated were
as follows: H, (1s)1; Li, (1s)2(2s)1; C, (2s)2(2p)2; N, (2s)2(2p)3; O, (2s)2(2p)4; F, (2s)2(2p)5; and Al, (3s)2(3p)1. Regarding k-point sampling, we chose Monkhorst–Pack 4 ×
4 × 1 grids56 for interface systems,
while in the case of isolated Alq3, we only considered
the Γ point. Other technical details include: weak vdW interaction
was treated by Grimme’s DFT-D2 scheme;57 the effective screening medium (ESM) method, more specifically,
the vacuum–slab–vacuum (BC1) condition, of Otani and
Sugino,49 was employed. Since the ESM-BC1
method realizes an open-boundary condition in the z direction (surface normal in our setup), no dipole correction is
necessary to compensate for spurious electrostatic interactions.49,58

We subsequently calculated physical properties from energies
and
charge/potential profiles obtained above. Adsorption energies for
Al(001)–Alq3 and Al(001)–LiF interface systems
were estimated by eq 5 5  where Eads+Al, Eads, and EAl (ads
= Alq3 or LiF) are total energies for the adsorbate–Al(001)
slab system, isolated adsorbate species, and the Al(001) slab, respectively.
Similarly, in the case of Al(001)–LiF–Alq3 multilayer systems, these were replaced with eq 6 6  Negative ΔE indicates
that corresponding adsorption is energetically favorable. The lateral
interaction energy of Alq3 was complementarily estimated
by the energy in the monolayer state with respect to that in the isolated
state, in which the optimized coordinates of the monolayer structure
was used. In each case, the lateral interaction energy was of the
order of −0.2 eV (Table S1 in the
Supporting Information), which did not have large influence on ΔE. Displaced charges and BDs were obtained according to eqs 2 and 4 (in Section 2), by
numerically integrating Δρ over the interval [−z0, z], where z0 is half of the z length in the unit
cell (in the present study, z0 = 24 Å).
