Hydrophilic aromatic polyurethane
(HAPU) microspheres were prepared
through dispersion polymerization of a rosin-based polyurethane dispersion
with C=C and styrene (St). The effects of the monomer ratio
(i.e., waterborne rosin-based aromatic polyurethane (WRPU) to St),
dispersant level, and reaction temperature on the properties of the
microspheres were investigated; the effects of pH and adsorption temperature
on the adsorption capacity of Orange II were also studied. The microspheres
were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,
energy-dispersive spectrometry, thermogravimetric analysis, laser
particle size analysis, and scanning electron microscopy. The results
showed that HAPU microspheres have been successfully synthesized and
the produced microspheres exhibited good thermal stability and monodispersion.
The optimum reaction conditions for the preparation of the microspheres
were determined as a monomer ratio (mWRPU/mSt) of 6:4 with 8 wt % poly(vinyl pyrrolidine)
(on the basis of the mixed monomer) at 80 °C for 8 h. Under these
conditions, the average particle size of the synthetic microspheres
was 120 nm and the particle size distribution index was 0.442. The
microspheres’ adsorption capacity for Orange II reached 17.53
mg·g–1 when the solid–liquid ratio was
1 g·L–1, with an initial concentration of 100
mg·L–1 at pH 5, and the adsorption was conducted
at 313 K for 3 h.

==== Body
Introduction
Polymer microspheres
are a kind of spherical or nearly spherical
particles. They are widely used in separation and adsorption and can
also be used as specific carriers of proteins, enzymes, antibodies,
or drugs for clinical examination, injection, oral drug administration,
and other applications. Polyurethane (PU) microspheres were first
reported in the 1970s, obtained directly from a separation column
by Hileman et al.1 PU microspheres have
a greater elastic behavior compared to those of conventional biodegradable
polymers, such as polylactic acid (PLA) and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid). In addition, the performance of the PU microspheres
can be controlled by changing the proportion and type of hard and
soft segments. PU microspheres can be prepared through chemical synthesis
as well as physical processing methods. The former method includes
(inverse) suspension polymerization, dispersion polymerization, and
emulsion polymerization.2 Of these, dispersion
polymerization has been found to be an efficient method for producing
monodisperse polymer particles with particle sizes in the range of
several hundred nanometers to micrometers.3

So far, the fabrication of PU resin typically requires some
amount
of organic solvents. Waterborne PU has become a hot topic of many
studies in recent years with respect to sustainable environmental
development and ensuring full use of the characteristics of PU. However,
the study of waterborne PU has mainly focused on its use in coatings,4 composites,5 microcapsules,6 leather, and adhesive industries; there are still
few reports on the preparation of PU microspheres. As a new type of
organic polymer material, PU microspheres contain many polar chemical
groups, such as −NHCOO, which exhibit high adsorption, chelation,
and ion exchange, as well as good stability in an aqueous solution.
At the same time, the larger specific surface area provides storage
places for target molecules, which could be used in biomedical applications.7 For example, Budriene et al.8 synthesized PU microspheres with a good thermal stability
and narrow particle size distribution, using 4,4′-diphenyl-methane
diisocyanate and poly(tetrahydrofuran) as raw materials, and the fixation
rate of maltogenase reached 97.5%. Liu et al.9 successfully prepared two kinds of PU microspheres with a shape
memory function using polycarbonate and isophorone diisocyanate or
hexamethylene diisocyanate as raw materials for vascular embolization,
respectively.

Degradability is a prerequisite for materials
used in environmental
protection and medicine. At present, biodegradable materials are mainly
classified into biopolymers, bioceramics, biological derivatives,
and hybrid materials. PU is an important component of the polymer-degradable
material, with increasing research focus on biodegradable PU. Desai
et al.10 prepared a corresponding PU material
using starch and a plant component (i.e., lignin, molasses, and wood
powder filler) as primary raw materials and verified its degradation
using the soil burial method. Zhang et al.11 synthesized a biodegradable castor oil-based PU, which was eventually
used as a carrier for drug release. Sullad et al.12 prepared blended microspheres of chitosan and PU through
a water-in-oil emulsion cross-linking method and used them to encapsulate
two water-soluble cardiovascular drugs. As one of the most common
natural renewable resource, rosin amounts to more than 1 billion tons
of annual production worldwide. The bulky hydrophenanthrene ring of
rosin can improve the mechanical strength of the resulting material,
and the double bonds and carboxyl group can be used as reactive centers
for modification; thus, it has been widely applied in chemistry, medicine,
and other fields.13 However, the synthesis
of biodegradable PU microspheres with rosin as a raw material has
not been reported. Due to rosin’s biodegradability, special
structure, and excellent compatibility with the human body, rosin-based
PU microspheres have great potential for responsive behaviors, such
as adsorption and drug release.

To combine the characteristics
of PU with those of rosin, stable,
uniform, and well-shaped PU microspheres were prepared through the
dispersion polymerization method using rosin as a raw material; the
effects of monomer ratio, dispersant level, and reaction temperature
on the properties of the microspheres were investigated. Furthermore,
the adsorption properties of the resulting microspheres, applied on
Orange II, were studied under different conditions.

Conclusions
The rosin-based aromatic hydrophilic PU microspheres with good
thermal stability and monodispersion were successfully prepared through
dispersion polymerization using biodegradable polyester as a soft
segment. The optimal conditions for the preparation of the PU microspheres
were determined. Under these conditions, the resulting microspheres
exhibited good sphericity and surface morphology, with an average
particle size of 120 nm and a polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.442.
The optimal adsorption conditions of the prepared microspheres for
Orange II were also determined, and the maximum adsorption capacity
of golden Orange II reached 17.53 mg·g–1. In
addition, on account of the electrostatic adsorption mechanism, the
pH value and temperature exerted a large impact on the adsorption.
The study provides a new way for the preparation of nanoscale biomass
polyurethane microspheres that can be potentially applied in the adsorption
field.

Experimental Section
Raw Materials and Chemicals
Industrial-grade
rosin
was provided by Guilin Xingsong Forest Chemical Co. Limited (Guangxi,
China). 2,4-Tolylene diisocyanate (TDI) was purchased from Alfa Aesar.
Analytical-grade reagents acetone, di-n-butylamine,
triethylamine (TEA), and azodiisobutyronitrile (AIBN) were all purchased
from Xilong Scientific Co. Chemically pure grade acrylic acid, styrene
(St), and di-n-butyltin dilaurate (DBTDL) were purchased
from Xilong Scientific Co. 2,2-Dimethylol propionic acid (DMPA) and
glycidyl methacrylate (GMA, 98%) were purchased from Aladdin Industrial
Co. The indicator bromocresol green was purchased from Xilong Scientific
Co. Chemically pure grade poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) and Orange
II were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. DMPA was
dehydrated at 120 °C for 4 h prior to use. St was purified through
a chromatographic column and kept in a cold refrigerator.

Synthesis of
an Adduct (RA) of Rosin and Acrylic Acid
RA was synthesized
through the Diels–Alder reaction (Scheme 1). Rosin was placed
in a three-necked flask equipped with a thermometer, a condenser,
a stirrer, and a nitrogen protection device. The flask was slowly
heated until the rosin melted completely. Acrylic acid (rosin/AA =
1:1.2, molar ratio) was then added dropwise at 230 °C for 1 h;
by ending the reaction when the acid value remained the same, the
adduct of acrylic acid and rosin was obtained.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of RA with
Rosin and Acrylic Acid
Synthesis of an Ester (RAG) of GMA and RA
An acrylic
rosin-based polyester diol (RAG) was synthesized through open-loop
esterification of GMA with RA (Scheme 2). RA was added to a three-necked flask equipped with
a stirrer, a thermometer, a condenser, and a nitrogen protection device.
The flask was immersed in an oil bath and maintained at 120 °C
until the RA was dissolved in toluene. Thereafter, GMA (RA/GMA = 1.0:2.0,
molar ratio), catalyst triethylamine (0.5 wt % of RA), and inhibitor
hydroquinone (0.5 wt % of GMA) were added to the system. After the
acid value remained unchanged, the reactor was cooled down and the
reaction mixture was filtered (i.e., removed the hydroquinone); the
ester of GMA and RA was obtained.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of RAG with RA and GMA
Preparation of WRPU Dispersion
RAG and DBTDL (0.5 wt
% of reactive monomer) were dissolved in acetone. A three-necked flask
containing the reaction mixture, fitted with a stirrer, a reflux condenser,
and a nitrogen inlet, was carefully heated to approximately 30 °C.
Next, TDI was introduced into the system for the reaction. The −NCO
content was determined using the acetone-di-n-butylamine
method. When the −NCO content was reduced to the theoretical
value, DMPA (11 wt % of the reaction monomer) was added and the reaction
mixture was heated to 55 °C. When the −NCO content dropped
to zero, the system was cooled down to 18 °C with ice water.
Subsequently, triethylamine (nTEA/nDMPA = 1.0:1.0) was added as a neutralizer under
stirring for 10 min. Finally, distilled water was added at 1300 rpm
to the reactor for emulsification for 30 min. The aromatic rosin-based
waterborne PU (WRPU) dispersion was obtained after removing acetone
using a rotary evaporator.

Preparation of WRPU Microspheres (Hydrophilic
Aromatic Polyurethane,
HAPU)
A designed amount of WRPU dispersion, St, dispersant
PVP, and initiator AIBN was dispersed with distilled water, using
an ultrasonicator for 10 min, and mixed uniformly (Scheme 3). Then, the mixture was added
to a 100 mL three-necked flask and heated to the specified temperature
under N2 protection for 8 h. After centrifugation of the
mixture at 10 000 rpm for 15 min, washing with distilled water,
secondary centrifugation, and air drying, the rosin-based aromatic
hydrophilic PU (HAPU) microspheres were obtained.

Microspheres with RAG, TDI, TEA, and St
Absorption of Orange II by HAPU Microspheres
The HAPU
microspheres (m = 0.03 g, solid-to-liquid ratio of
1 g·L–1) were placed into several conical flasks,
and Orange II with different pH values (V = 30 mL),
with an initial concentration of 100 mg·L–1, was added. After oscillation adsorption for 3 h at different temperatures,
the absorbance value of the solution at the maximum absorption wavelength
(λmax = 484 nm) was determined. Finally, the adsorption
amount of Orange II by the microspheres was calculated according to formula 1. 1  where Q represents
the adsorption
of Orange II by the microspheres (mg·g–1); C0 and C are the concentrations
of Orange II before and after adsorption (mg·L–1), respectively; V is the volume of Orange II (mL);
and m is the quantity of Orange II (g).

Characterization
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectra were recorded on an IS10 FT-IR spectrometer. Thermal gravimetric
analysis (TGA) was carried out with an SDT-Q600 system from 30 to
600 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C·min–1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. Scanning electric microscopy (SEM)
was carried out using JSM-6380LV to investigate the size and morphology
of the HAPU. A digital pH meter (PHS-25) was used to regulate different
pH values of Orange II solution. The absorbance of Orange II solution
was measured by a UV–vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer instruments
Co. Ltd., Shanghai). An energy-dispersive spectrometer (equipped on
JSM-6380LV) was used to analyze the types and contents of elements
in the microspheres and to study the pellet-forming mechanism by comparing
the particle size distribution. The particle size and distribution
were tested by a laser diffraction particle size analyzer (ZS-90,
Malvern, U.K.).

The surfaces of HAPU microspheres were characterized
by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific ESCALAB
250Xi).

Results and Discussion
Effects of Monomer Ratios
We investigated the effect
of the monomer ratio on the performance of HAPU microspheres under
the condition of a PVP content of 6 wt % (on monomer weight, the same
hereafter), a monomer concentration of 8 wt %, and a reaction temperature
of 85 °C. The particle size and particle size distribution of
the HAPU microspheres prepared using different monomer ratios were
determined, and the results are shown in Table 1 and Figure 1. With the increase of WRPU content, the average particle
size increased, whereas the particle size distribution narrowed. The
WRPU molecules are linear structures and are mainly aggregated through
hydrogen bonds. As the content of St increased, the cross-linking
density of the segments increased due to their chemical bonds, resulting
in the reduction of the particle size.14 The increase in the St content also reduced the content of hydrophilic
WRPU in each colloidal particle and increased the amount of small
particle size, resulting in a wider particle size distribution. In
addition, Figure 1 shows
two peaks of different sizes below and above 100 nm and the intensity
of the peak for the larger particle sizes increased with the WRPU
content; this suggested that the number of the large microspheres
increased, whereas the number of the small microspheres decreased.

size distribution diagram of the HAPU microspheres synthesized
with different monomer ratios (mWRPU/mSt: (a) 8:2; (b) 7:3; (c) 6:4; (d) 5:5; and
(e) 4:6).

6:4	161	0.445	
5:5	141	0.512	
4:6	133	0.528	
As shown in Figure S3a,
when mWRPU/mSt = 8:2,
the microspheres exhibited poor sphericity and were mostly irregular.
The reason is that a high content of WRPU yielded insufficiently rigid
microspheres and eventually led to irregular collapse. From Figure S3b–e, we can observe that the
surface of the microspheres becomes severely rougher as the content
of WRPU increases, which could be attributed to the low content of
St or excessive WRPU attached to the surface of the micelles, forming
an irregular state. From the comprehensive consideration of the utilization
rate of rosin and WRPU in the microspheres, as well as the final exhibition
of the sphericity, it was concluded that the optimal mWRPU/mSt reaction condition
was 6:4.

Effects of Dispersant Amount
When the polymerization
conditions were fixed (mWRPU/mSt = 6:4, a monomer concentration of 8 wt %, and a reaction
temperature of 85 °C), the performance of the HAPU microspheres
was determined by varying the level of the dispersant PVP. As shown
in Table S1 and Figure 2, the particle size of the microspheres decreased
with the increase of PVP content. According to the classic theoretical
relationship of Smith–Ewart (Np = K[I]0.4[S]0.6[M]), the
number of emulsion colloidal particles, Np, is proportional to the concentration of the dispersant [S]0.6; when the concentration of the dispersant increases, the
number of emulsion colloidal particles will also increase and the
nucleation rate of the WRPU and St mixture increases, resulting in
an increase in the number of the microspheres and a decrease of the
particle size. The particle size distribution curve, with 2 wt % PVP,
is unimodal. However, with an increase in the amount of PVP, the particle
size distribution curves are divided into two peaks; a small peak
area shows a trend of increase, and the particle size distribution
becomes wider. An increase of the PVP level decreases the particle
size of the microsphere and increases the chances of collision between
colloidal particles, which means that the probability of “secondary
nucleation” increases and the particle size distribution becomes
wider.

Figure 2 Particle size distribution curves of HAPU microspheres prepared
with different dispersant levels ((a) 2%, (b) 4%, (c) 6%, and (d)
8%).

As seen from Figure S4a, many microspheres
connected and grooves appeared on some microspheres. This was attributed
to the lower concentration of PVP and the poorer dispersion ability
of WRPU and St in the early stage of nucleation; therefore, the microspheres
easily aggregated together and the small ball nuclei were adsorbed
on the surface of the large ball nuclei. At the end of the reaction,
the small microspheres detached from the surface of large microspheres
and formed a relatively smooth groove. With the increase in the PVP
level, there was no agglomeration of the microspheres and the microspheres
became smooth overall. As a surfactant, PVP could reduce the interfacial
tension of the WRPU/St micelle, making the emulsion stable. Thus,
improving the PVP content affords the microspheres a good dispersion
and smoothness.

Effects of Reaction Temperature
The performances of
the HAPU microspheres were determined with respect to reaction temperature
under fixed polymerization conditions (mWRPU/mSt = 6:4, a monomer concentration of
8 wt %, and PVP contents of 6 wt %). As observed from Table S2 and Figure 3, the particle size of the microspheres decreased
as the reaction temperature increased whereas the particle size distribution
widened. When the reaction temperature was 70 °C, the particle
size distribution curve was unimodal. With increasing temperature,
the curve splits from a single peak to bimodal; the shape of the small
peak grew gentler and the peak area also increased, whereas the large
peak decayed. Meanwhile, the microspheres became less uniform and
the particle size distribution became wider. This was attributed to
an increase in the reaction temperature, which accelerated the decomposition
rate of initiator AIBN and increased the generation rate of free radicals,
thus leading to the increase of spherical nuclei and decrease of particle
size. At the same time, the adherence of PVP to the surface of the
emulsion colloidal particles weakened and the surface of the colloidal
particles became thinner; the aggregation ability between colloidal
particles also increased, with some microspheres exhibiting larger
particle sizes, and the particle size distribution became wider. As
seen from Figure S5, when the temperature
was 70 °C, the surface of the microspheres was rough and the
microspheres aggregated together. As the temperature increased, the
surface of the microspheres became smooth and the aggregation phenomenon
decayed. This was attributed to the incomplete polymerization of the
monomer at low temperatures, resulting in a lack of rigidity of the
microspheres and easy aggregation. On the basis of various factors,
the optimal reaction temperature was 80 °C.

particle size distribution curves (right)
of the HAPU microspheres synthesized at different reaction temperatures
((a) 70 °C, (b) 75 °C, (c) 80 °C, and (d) 85 °C).

Thermal Resistance Analysis
The thermal gravimetric
analysis (TGA) and differential thermal gravity (DTG) curves of WRPU
and HAPU are shown in Figure 4. Three thermal degradation stages of WRPU and HAPU are observed
in the TGA curves. The first stage of degradation occurring in the
temperature range of 100–150 °C is related to the volatilization
of the residual solvent and water. The second stage of degradation
occurring at approximately 320 °C is attributed to the decomposition
of the hard segment (i.e., urethane). The third stage of degradation
at approximately 443 °C is due to the decomposition of the soft
segment (i.e., RAG) and St, and the amount of decomposition clearly
increases. The temperature of HAPU at T50% increases from 393 to 424 °C, whereas the temperature at the
maximum weight-loss rate in the third stage also increases from 438
to 447 °C. The results indicate that the enhancement of the cross-linking
density of HAPU achieved through increasing the content of St can
improve its thermal stability, which is attributed to the interpenetrating
network structure obtained from copolymerization between WRPU and
St, increasing the energy required for thermal decomposition of the
segment.15

Adsorption of Orange II
with the HAPU Microspheres
Figure 5a displays
the effect of the pH value of the HAPU microsphere in water on the
adsorption capacity of Orange II. Note that the adsorption capacity
first increases and then decreases with the increase of the pH value;
the maximum adsorption amount reaches 17.53 mg·g–1. The reason is that when the pH value was relatively low, due to
its high H+ concentration in the solution, the dissociation
degree of the sulfonic acid group in golden Orange II was low and
the active site of interaction with the microsphere was reduced, resulting
in a lower adsorption amount. When the pH value of the adsorbent was
5, the −NH on the surface of the microspheres protonates to
−NH2+; in this case, −SO3– dissociated from the Orange II was adsorbed through
electrostatic interaction and the maximum adsorption amount was obtained.
As the pH value went up further, the degree of −NH protonation
decreased, thus reducing the amount of adsorption. Hence, a pH value
of 5 was the preferred adsorption condition.

Figure 5 Effect of pH values (a)
and temperature (b) on the adsorption of
Orange II.

Effect of Temperature on
Adsorption Capacity
As observed
in Figure 5b, when
the temperature increased, the adsorption amount of the microspheres
to Orange II first increased and then decreased. The effect of changing
temperature on the amount of adsorption is the result of the combined
effects of chemical kinetics and thermodynamics. On one hand, as the
temperature rises, the motion of −SO3– dissociated from the golden Orange II molecule accelerated and the
collision probability increased with −NH2+, resulting in an increase in the adsorption capacity of the microspheres.
However, when the temperature increased further, the adsorption capacity
of the microspheres decreased because the adsorption of −NH2+ into the molecular structure of the Orange–Orange
II with the HAPU microspheres was an exothermic reaction and the rise
in the temperature did not favor the adsorption of the golden Orange
molecule to the polymer microspheres, resulting in a decrease in the
amount of adsorption.
