1 Introduction
Elemental cerium exhibiting
([Xe] 4f15d16s2) electronic configuration
is normally found in both +3 ([Xe]
4f15d06s0) and +4 ([Xe] 4f05d06s0) oxidation states; it received considerable
attention in the past several decades owing to its excellent catalytic
performance in various heterogeneous catalytic reactions involving
redox chemistry. More specifically, the high oxygen storage capacity
(OSC) associated with the valence change between Ce3+ and
Ce4+, a surface charge with acidic and basic sites as well
as the high-level crystal phase stability of the material make it
as an excellent choice to exploit various catalytic applications.
CeO2 plays a pivotal role in automotive pollution control.
The development of the three way catalysts was to treat the tailpipe
exhaust gas from automobiles to oxidize the product, mainly to control
the pollutants and to convert gases like CO, volatile organics, and
NOx present in the automotive exhaust
to H2O, CO2, and N2. CeO2 is also used to remove SOx from the
fluidized catalytic cracking process and several oxidation reactions.1,2

Though the CeO2 catalyst is having acid/base and
redox
properties, it also had been explored for various organic reactions;
for example, Tamura et al. reported a simple ceria catalyst for hydration
of nitrile in aqueous conditions to form amides. In this process,
the Lewis acidic sites and basic sites of the low-coordinated CeO2 helps the reaction to process easily.3,4 It
is observed that among the various oxide supports, ceria-based catalysts
were found to be highly active and selective toward amide formation.5 The hydration of nitriles to generate the corresponding
amides is an important transformation from both academic and industrial
points of view. Amides not only constitute versatile building blocks
in synthetic organic chemistry but also have a wide range of industrial
applications and biologically active and pharmacological interests.6−9

In this work, the production of such organic substances from
dual
immiscible reactants is highly affected by using ceria-supported phase
transfer catalysts (PTCs). When the reactants are mixed in immiscible
phases, PTCs carry active species which penetrates another phase,
where the reaction occurs and produces a selectively high yield. Because
of the presence of PTCs, reactions generally work up under ambient
conditions with easy work-up processes, and hence these catalysts
are commercially very significant. Currently, PTC is an ingenious
process, which is also environmentally benign. The reaction mechanism
indicates that the reaction pathway proceeds through the formation
of hydroxyl ions over the “Ce”-supported catalyst, to
enhance the formation of such reactive ions and several organic reactions
both microwave irradiation and ultrasound used.4,9−18 High temperature and local pressure are induced with ultrasonic
waves to increase the mass transfer and flow of the reactants, and
this helps in reducing the reaction time and increase the yield.19

Although ceria depicts excellent activity
in several catalytic
applications, which are assigned to a relative allay of oxygen vacancy
constitution and enhanced in surface area than that of the bulk form,20,21 but it has some limitations as ceria has less thermal constancy,24 ensuing in the release of OSC, surface area,
and in turn, its catalytic activity. It is known that the addition
of the second oxide relatively in trace amounts and the catalytic
activity of the primary component are affected considerably.22−26

The rare-earth oxides such as Ce, “Sm, La”,
and “Ru”
have been chosen for the current work, as they have vivid applications
in catalysis. They depict good catalytic properties in various organic
reactions, also in the synthesis of ammonia and oxidative coupling
of methane, and so forth.26−29 The wide range of the surface area to the pore volume
of the nanoparticle assures to enhance their catalytic properties,
especially in the number of surface oxygen species.30 The other reported catalysts for the hydration process
are mainly CeO2, MnO2, TiO2, CaO,
Y2O3, La2O3, and ZrO24; however, they have few drawbacks, such as high
retention time for the reactants, molar ratio of the reactant (nitriles)
to H2O, the volume of catalyst loading, high pressure,
and high temperature.

To overcome these drawbacks, in the present
work, a novel, highly
active, and stable catalyst composition consisting of lanthanides
as promoters and ruthenium as the co-promoter have been successfully
evaluated for the hydration of nitrile in the presence of ultrasonic
cavitation.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Catalyst
Synthesis
This study provides
a process for the preparation of the Ce-supported PTCs denoted as
CSR (Ce–Sm–Ru) and CLR (Ce–La–Ru), which
are mixed metal oxide catalysts. Ce–La/Sm–Ru-(90:9.5:0.5)
wt % were synthesized and characterized by using various characterization
techniques, and these catalysts are subjected to catalytic activity
with and without ultrasound cavitation influence.

The catalyst
synthesis was done in a three-step process:

Step 1: solution
A: cerium precursor [cerium(III) nitrate hexahydrate
99.99% (Sigma-Aldrich)] was taken and dissolved in 20 mL of deionized
water and held under continuous stirring at 550 rpm.

Step 2:
solution B: ruthenium precursor [ruthenium(III) chloride-99.98%
hydrate solution-Sigma-Aldrich] was dissolved in 5 mL of deionized
water. Then, the precursor of La/Sm [lanthanum/samarium(III) nitrate
hexahydrate-99.99% (Sigma-Aldrich)] was added to Ru solution. To attain
homogeneity, the water quantity was adjusted.

Step 3: solution
B was added dropwise to solution A with constant
stirring at 85 °C, where yellowish slurry was formed. The formed
slurry was aged at 150 °C for 5 h with stirring at 700 rpm. After
the completion of aging, catalyst slurry was subjected for drying
at 180 °C for 6 h. The dried catalyst was calcined by heating
at a ramp rate of 2 °C/min and heated to 200 °C for 3 h,
further heated to 500 °C for next 3 h, and then calcined to 900
°C for 12 h. Calcined catalysts were denoted as CSR and CLR,
respectively.

2.2 Catalyst Characterization
The synthesized
catalysts were characterized by using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD),
energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX), field emission scanning electron
microscope (FE-SEM), N2– adsorption–desorption
(BET surface analysis), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HR-TEM), and temperature-programmed desorption study for probe molecules
(TPD of NH3 and CO2), Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and laser Raman spectra
analysis.

XRD of the catalysts was carried out using an X’Pert
Pro diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å)
with a proportional counter as the detector. The profiles of the catalysts
were recorded in theta ranging from 10 to 90° at a scanning rate
of 4°/min. The mean crystal size (d) was calculated
by the line broadening method with the Scherer equation d = Kλ/β cos θ, where “K” is the Scherrer constant (0.89), “λ”
is the wavelength of the X-ray, “β” is the full
width of peak at half-maximum height (fwhm), and “θ”
is the diffraction angle of CeO2(111).

Microstructure
studies for the catalysts were carried out by FE-SEM,
and it was carried out on an accelerating voltage of 10 kV. The samples
were mechanically deposited on the holders and subsequently gold-coated
to reduce charge build up.

The typical operating conditions
of the HR-TEM instrument (Jeol
JEM 200) is 200 kV electrons (field emission gun), 10–6 mbar
vacuum, and 0.1 nm resolution. HR-TEM was used for imaging of the
microstructure and compositional analysis of the PTC catalyst. The
bright field image is studied from the diffracted electron beams,
which shows a little decrease in the angle from the transmitted beam.

2.3 Catalytic Activity Study
Starting
materials such as 2-cynopyridine (99%) and product standards such
as 2-picolinamide (2-PA) 98% and extraction solvents such as dichloromethane
(DCM, AR grade) were procured from Sigma-Aldrich. The catalyst activity
was tested for the hydration reaction of 2-cynopyridine with water
to form 2-PA as the selective product. This reaction was conducted
in a round-bottom flask connected with a reflux condenser. The required
energy for the reaction was supplied by a heating bath. The effect
of ultrasonic cavitation was also tested for the same for which the
round-bottom flask was submerged in an ultrasonic cavitation bath.
Nitrile conversion and yield of the reaction were determined by GC
Agilent (model number-7890 A) using an HP-5 capillary column (length-30
m × 250 μm × 0.25 μm) (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Hydration Reaction Pathway
3 Results and Discussion
Ceria is utilized as the support and acts as a reaction initiator
which adsorbs and dissociates water molecules, forming the Ce–hydroxyl
complex; at the same time, it is also forming a Ce–nitrile
complex which further initiates the reaction. Sm/La and Ru oxides
act as the promoter and co-promoter, respectively, for this reaction
as they provide acidic sites for the reactant adsorption.

3.1 X-ray Diffraction
XRD patterns revealed
(Figure 1) that the
CSR and CLR exhibit a cubic fluorite structure32 with unit cell parameters of 0.5427 nm (CSR) and 0.5432
nm (CLR), respectively. The average crystallite size of catalysts
was determined using Debye–Scherer equation from the (111)
peak of CeO2 which were found to be 10.6 and 12.3 nm, respectively.
The different diffraction angles for Sm/La and Ru were identified
with the help of X’pert Pro software. The diffraction peaks
of all samples could be indexed to 111, 200, 311, 222, 400, 331, 420,
and 422 crystal faces, attributed to the face-centered cubic phase
of CeO2 (JCPDS 34-0394).20 As
shown in Figure 1,
the peaks of CeO2 exhibit (a) poor crystallinity with smaller
crystallite size in CSR, and this catalyst shows the existence of
many lattice defects having a pure cubic fluorite structure (JCPDF04-0593)
and space group Fm3m (225).

3.2 Morphological (FE-SEM) Study
The
FE-SEM profile shows platelets and irregular shape with an edge length
of 5–10 μm (Figure 1a,b); despite the distribution
of the crystals in high density, the presence of agglomeration demonstrates
the homogenous solid solution formation by the dispersion of Sm/La
and Ru oxide over the CeO2 surface.

Figure 1 XRD patterns of CSR and
CLR catalysts.

This result of SEM indicated that
defects sites of the CeO2-supported catalyst might perform
a better activity for the
hydration reaction, which is also confirmed by XRD. The bulk portion
was taken for elemental quantification analysis for CSR and CLR catalysts,
respectively.

3.3 Energy-Dispersive X-ray
Spectroscopy
Table 1 and Figure 2c,d represent the
EDAX spectrum of Ce, Sm, La, Ru, and O peaks which are related to
its respective metal oxide presence in the CeO2-supported
PTC oxide catalysts. The EDAX data are also agreeing with HR-TEM (Figure 3c–e) and elemental
mapping data (Figure 5a,b), where the homogenous dispersion of Ce, Sm, La, Ru, and O has
been found.

3.4 High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope
Figure 3a–e
shows HR-TEM for CSR and CLR catalysts. The oxides of Ce, La/Sm, and
Ru are distinctly seen in close proximity. This demonstrates the solid
solution nature of the reported catalysts in this communication. The
marginal shift in d-spacing values (shown in HR-TEM
images) is attributed to the stress of accommodating La/Sa and Ru
oxides in the ceria crystallites.8,24,31 In Figure 3e, La2O3 and CeO2 exhibited
the overlapped lattice fringes for CLR oxides (d—0.34
nm), and Figure 3c,d
also shows the overlapped lattice fringes for CSR oxides (d—0.34 nm) and individually for Sm2O3 (d—0.228 nm).31 The bulk portion was taken for elemental mapping for CSR
and CLR catalysts, respectively.

3.5 Elemental
Mapping
Figure 3f,g clearly shows the formation
of a homogenous solid solution of (Ce·Sm/La·Ru) oxides and
dispersion of elements on the ceria surface. It is evenly representing
the elemental mapping of CeO2 supported PTC oxide catalyst,
respectively.

3.6 Fourier-Transform Infrared
Spectroscopy
Figure 4a,b shows
the FT-IR spectra of the bands at 1638 and 3200 cm–1 which represents the water and the hydroxyl stretches, respectively.33 The intensive band at 1400 cm–1 represents the N–O stretch due to the presence of nitrate.
The strong absorption band observed below 600 cm–1 represents the Ce–O stretch. No vibrational features were
observed due to the presence of Sm–O and La–O, which
indicated the formation of a homogeneous solid solution.33−35 XRD and HR-TEM results were also evident for the abovementioned
conclusion.

PTC oxide catalyst.

3.7 NH3/CO2-TPD
The PTC catalysts exhibited nearly
equal acidic and basic (bifunctional)
properties for CSR and CLR catalysts (Table 2). Table 2 also provides other physicochemical characteristics.

Table 2 Physicochemical Properties of the
Catalysts
catalysts	crystal size, D (nm)	unit cell
parameter (nm)	SBET(m2/g)	average pore
size (nm)	total pore
volume (cc/g)	total acidity (mmol/g)	total basicity (mmol/g)	
CSR	10.6	0.5427	86.7	2.42	0.105	0.43	0.41	
CLR	12.3	0.5432	79.0	2.69	0.106	0.49	0.49	
However, the absolute
values of acidity/basicity are significantly
different for CSR and CLR catalysts. The present work exemplified
that CeO2/(Sm/La)2O3/Ru2O3 phases are synergistically responsible for the activation
of various nitriles.

The density of acid/base sites on CeO2-supported catalysts
was quantified by NH3/CO2-TPD at different desorption
peaks at 50–200, 200–400, and 400–800 °C
which represents the weak, medium, and strong sites, respectively
(Figures 5 and 6a,b) (Table 2). The PTC catalysts are having
a large amount of acidity/basicity at the strong (400–800 °C)
site. CSR and CLR are amphoteric in nature as it is has an acidity
of 0.43 and 0.49 mmol/g and a basicity of 0.41 and 0.49 mmol/g, respectively.
This amphoteric nature might be responsible for the high selectivity
of hydration of nitrile toward their corresponding amide.

oxide catalyst CSR (a) and CLR (b).

3.8 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
Figure 7a–c
reveals the X-ray photoelectron spectra of the Ce 3d and La 3d core
levels with six and eight peaks corresponding to Ce 3d3/2 and Ce 3d5/2 spin–orbit components. The peaks
ranging from of u″ (905.94–907.83)
and u‴ (915.37–916.13) corresponds
to Ce4+ 3d3/2, while v″
(886.04–886.61) and v‴ (897.58–897.92)
corresponds to Ce4+ 3d5/2, and the peaks assigned
to u′ (900–901.2) and v″ (881.76–882.01) describes to Ce3+ 3d5/2 species.36Figure 7c shows only one spectrum at
838.5 eV, which is addressed to La 3d5/2, and according
to the literature, it shows the defected ceria sites (Ce3+) and lanthanum (La2+). These indicate that our synthesized
ceria-supported PTC has high OSC because of the presence of Ce3+ and La2+.34,36 No significant intensity
for Sm 3d and Ru 3d spectra was observed, indicating that the contribution
of these elements on the surface under XPS conditions is insignificant.
A small amount of Ru 3d could be a possible reason for not observing
the Ru core-level spectrum. Sm may form a homogeneous solid solution
with Ce, or it may be present as elemental Sm; therefore, no spectrum
corresponds to the same observed in this XPS profile.

3.9 N2 Adsorption–Desorption
(BET Surface Analysis)
Figure 8a,b represents the N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms at −196 °C and the pore size distribution according
to the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda method for the PTC samples.
According to IUPAC, it classified the shapes of the adsorption isotherms
for samples as type IV with a hysteresis loop, which is associated
with capillary condensation in the mesopores. It was observed that
the initial part of the isotherm where the relative pressure p/p° ≈ 0.3 of CSR/CLR catalysts
can be attributed to monolayer adsorption. Total pore volume, specific
surface area (SBET), and average pore
size for CSR/CLR were found to be 86.75 and 79 m2/g; 0.105
and 0.106 cc/g; and 24 and 26.9 Å, respectively.

Figure 8 (a,b) N2-physisorption
isotherm of CSR and CLR.

3.10 Raman
Spectra
The cubic fluorite
phase formed in the commercial CeO2 catalyst (Figure 9) has been confirmed
by the high intense peak at 460 cm–1 observed in
Raman spectra which describe the vibrational mode of the above type
of structure, also confirmed by XRD. The structure conformation conveyed
that the symmetric breathing mode of oxygen atoms present around Ce
ions is sensitive to the sub lattice oxygen from any nonstoichiometry.
The band at 460 cm–1 is not changed in intensity
but shifted to a lower frequency for CSR and CLR sample (450.89 and
448.74 cm–1), respectively. The insertion of (Sm/La)Ru
ions into CeO2 which decreases the vibrational frequency
of the metal–anion band accredited to the larger atomic mass
of Sm, La, and Ru than that of Ce and the variation of the lattice
parameter. The shift in the frequencies in both catalysts reveals
the formation of ceria solid solution with (Sm/La)Ru ions, resulting
in different oxidation states for ceria (Ce4+ and Ce3+), samarium (Sm3+), and lanthanum (La2+), where the Ru-oxidation state disappeared as its weight percentage
is very low.

4 Experimental
Section and Activity Studies
4.1 Hydration of Nitrile Catalyzed
by CSR/CLR
and Commercial CeO2 Catalyst without Cavitation Influence
The reaction was conducted at 140 °C for 3 and 6 h, and the
resulting mixture was extracted with DCM (30 mL) and used for GC analysis
by following reaction conditions: 2-CP/H2O molar ratio
(1:1), where 2-CP is 50.41 mmol and H2O is 55 mmol with
10 wt % of CSR/CLR and commercial ceria (approximately 0.52 g). Reaction
results in Figure 10 show that amongst the CSR, CLR, and pure CeO2 (commercial),
the CSR catalyst is more active for the hydration. This higher activity
of CSR can be justified with the help of the physical properties of
the catalyst which we studied during this work. The characterization
data reveals that the CSR is having a higher surface area when compared
to CLR (Table 2) and
reported commercial CeO2.37 Apart
from this, CSR is also having an appropriate ratio of acidic to the
basic site. The other reason for the higher activity of the CSR catalyst
can be substantiated with the help of elemental mapping (Figure 3f) which reveals
the uniform dispersion of the elements over the catalyst surface and
the formation of homogenous solid solution which makes this catalyst
superior to the other tested catalysts.

Figure 10 Catalyst activity comparison
of CSR, CLR, and pure CeO2 commercial.

4.2 Effect of Temperature Using CSR without Cavitation
Influence
The effect of temperature on the reaction between
2-CP and water (molar ratio of 1:10) to form 2-PA with 10 wt % catalyst
loading for 6 h by varying the temperature from 30 to 140 °C.
It is demonstrated that the reactivity is enhanced with rise in the
temperature. The collision of the reactants at higher temperature
is also increased. Hence, the apparent yield of the amide is increased
at a higher temperature. These results are demonstrated in Figure 11, which is plotted
against temperature and yield of amide (2-PA).

Figure 11 Effect of reaction temperature
on the rate of 2-cyanopyridine hydration
reaction under reflux conditions.

4.3 Effect of Ultrasound and without Ultrasound
on the Reaction
The effect of cavitation for the hydration
of nitrile to the corresponding amide was performed for different
intervals of time 1–6 h. The reaction temperature was maintained
at 45 °C for cavitation experiments and 60 °C for without
cavitation experiments. The result indicates that the conversion increases
linearly over time with or without ultrasonic irradiation. It is to
be noted that the cavities release highly unstable OH ions in the
solution, which helps the reaction in the presence of the catalyst.19 However, with ultrasonication cavitation, high
rate of reaction is observed at 45 °C in comparison to the reaction
conducted under the conventional reflux method (without ultrasonication)
over time (Figure 12).

Figure 12 Influences of ultrasonic cavitation.

The influences of ultrasonic cavitation have been studied with
the following reaction condition: 2-cyanopyridine/H2O (molar
ratio) 1:10, catalyst loading −10 wt % (with respect to 2-cyanopyridine
loading). The reaction mixture was stirred at 600 rpm, and the reaction
temperature for cavitation experiments was 45 and 60 °C without
cavitation experiments.

5 Conclusions
The
characterization data suggest that the Ce-supported Sm and
La oxide catalyst is better for the hydration of nitriles as these
compositions can successfully eliminate the drawbacks of the known
catalyst. Catalysts have appropriate acidic and basic sites and can
also form homogeneous distribution of active metals on the CeO2 support. The catalytic activity is tested at various temperatures
under the influence of ultrasonic cavitation, which helps for the
formation of highly unstable hydroxyl ions. PTC exhibits efficient
catalytic activity for the hydration of nitriles to produce corresponding
amides. Experimental results show the yield of 2-PA at 45 °C
under the influence of ultrasonic cavitation, where it increases linearly
over time.
