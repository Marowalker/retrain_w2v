The
adsorption of tetracyanoquinodimethane and of the closely related
derivative tetrafluorotetracyanoquinodimethane on the (111) surfaces
of the coinage metals, namely, copper, silver, and (unreconstructed)
gold, has been studied by dispersion-corrected ab initio density functional
theory calculations. In order to separate the molecule–substrate
interaction from the effects of molecule–molecule interaction,
only the isolated molecules are considered. The results show that,
in this case, the strength of the interaction of both molecules with
the surfaces decreases in the expected order Cu > Ag > Au. The
total
amount of charge transfer, however, behaves in a different way, being
larger for Ag and smaller for Cu and Au. This trend can be explained
by a combination of the differences in the work functions of the three
metals and the amount of backdonation between the molecule and the
metal.

Introduction
Organic electronics has received an impressive
boost in the last
years, and organic electronic devices, like printed solar cells or
flexible lights and displays, are starting to become part of our everyday
life.1−3 Being both a cause and a consequence of this rapid
growth, the study of the electronic properties of organic compounds,
in general, and of electron-acceptor or electron-donor species, in
particular, as fundamental components of these devices, has concurrently
been the subject of an increasing level of attention.4,5 In particular, the interaction of an organic layer of electron-acceptor
molecules with a metal surface has been extensively studied since
it was soon realized that the performances of these devices strongly
depend on the energy barriers at the metal–organic interfaces
within6−15 and it has become clear by now that the deposition of an organic
molecule on a metal substrate can affect the structural and electronic
properties of both the molecule and the metal surface,15,16 thus modifying the injection energy barriers from the expected vacuum
energy level alignment.

Since its first synthesis17 and the
subsequent report of a high electrical conductivity in some of its
salts,18−20 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) (Figure 1a) has assumed a
very important role in these research studies. TCNQ is one of the
strongest organic electron-acceptor molecules, with a high electron
affinity (between 2.88 and 3.38 eV),21−23 and able to form a large
number of charge transfer complexes with metallic or organic donors,24 some of which are superconductive at relatively
high temperatures.25 It is also a component
of many molecule-based organic magnets26 and participates in enzyme-based biosensors.27 The derivative compound 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane
(F4-TCNQ) (Figure 1b), obtained by the substitution of the peripherical hydrogen atoms
with electronegative fluorine atoms, shows an even greater acceptor
behavior, with an electron affinity of 5.08–5.24 eV.28 Both molecules have been routinely used to decrease
the hole injection barrier at the metal–organic interface either
by doping the hole transport layer or as an intermediate buffer layer
between the hole transport layer and the metal anode.29−32 Recently, it has also been shown that doping the electron injection
layer with TCNQ33 or inserting a TCNQ buffer
layer between the electron transport layer and the metal cathode34 can also improve the performance of organic
light-emmiting devices.

LUMO orbitals, and
electronic isosurfaces for (a) TCNQ and (b) F4-TCNQ. The frontier
orbital isosurfaces correspond to an electron density of 0.01 electrons/Å3. The electronic isosurface represents a surface of points
with the same total electron density (0.03 electrons/Å3) colored according to the values of the electrostatic potential
in every point.

The adsorption of TCNQ and F4-TCNQ
on different metal surfaces
has been the subject of many different experimental and theoretical
studies.16,31,35−56 From the early results, it was clear that both molecules adsorb
flat on most metal surfaces, accepting negative charge from the substrate
and causing an increase in the work function of the system. Maybe
the only exception is the adsorption of TCNQ on the Au(111) surface.
In here, a decrease of the work function has been experimentally measured,44,55 and both theory and experiments seem to indicate that TCNQ is physisorbed
on the Au(111) surface and there is no charge transfer between the
molecule and the gold substrate.39,43,52,55 In some cases, molecular
distortion and/or surface reconstruction have also been reported.16,38,40,46−48,51,53 Upon adsorption, the molecule has been claimed to adopt a bent geometry,
with the cyano groups closer to the surface than the central carbon
ring, while the metal atoms directly underneath the nitrogen atoms
are slightly pulled outward the surface. More recently, however, this
bending geometry has been questioned. In particular, for the TCNQ/Ag(111)
system, a more planar molecular structure with the presence of substrate
adatoms has been demonstrated.56 Actually,
besides TCNQ on Ag(111),44,56,57 the participation of adatoms in the room temperature assembly of
TCNQ and F4-TCNQ on Au(111) has also been suggested.44,45,55−58 To what extent this is a common behavior
remains still unclear.

Thus, although the general characteristics
seem well established,
some questions remain still open. In particular, a comparative study
of the adsorption of TCNQ on different metal surfaces is still lacking.
An important theoretical study on the adsorption of F4-TCNQ on the
coinage metals Cu(111), Ag(111), and Au(111)40 was somewhat hampered by the fact that no dispersion forces were
taken into account in the calculations, which makes the adsorption
geometry to be slightly different from the results reported here.
Also, while adsorption on the Cu(111) surface has been thoroughly
studied theoretically,46,51 reports on the Au(111) and Ag(111)
surfaces are more scarce,43,48 and a direct comparison
is difficult by the use of different calculation methods. In addition,
the comparison of the different systems is further complicated by
the fact that the molecular assembly is different in every system,
and even for the same system, several phases can coexist on the surface.37,44,46,48,51,55,56

Here, we show a comparative computational study
based on the density
functional theory (DFT) of the adsorption of TCNQ and F4-TCNQ on the
(111) surfaces of the coinage metals, namely, copper, silver, and
gold. To make a direct comparison possible, we try to separate the
molecule–substrate interaction from the molecule–molecule
interaction, and thus, in this work, we focus only on the adsorption
of isolated molecules, not taking into account the different phases
reported as the coverage increases. In addition, the presence of substrate
adatoms is also neglected. Since the possible appearance of adatoms
is strongly temperature-dependent,59,60 we do not
expect them to be relevant at low enough temperatures.

Results and Discussion
Table 1 and Figure 2 show the bond lengths
calculated for the neutral gas-phase TCNQ and F4-TCNQ molecules and
their anions. The results compare well with the experimental data,
the average difference between experimental measurements and calculated
bond lengths being 0.02 Å.61−63 As already reported,64 the introduction of a negative charge leads
to the partial aromatization of the central C ring and the lengthening
of the B3 bond, which acquires a marked single-bond character. The
extra negative charge is mostly accommodated over the two dicyanomethylene
groups. Actually, a Mulliken population analysis reveals that each
N atom in the anion and dianion forms of TCNQ carries charges of 0.27
and 0.39 electrons, respectively. The electron affinity, calculated
as EA = E(N) – E(N + 1), where E(Ni) is the ground state of the molecule with Ni electrons,43 is
3.45 eV, which agrees with previous experimental measurements23 and calculations.65,66

The minimum energy optimized structures
upon adsorption of TCNQ
on Cu(111), Ag(111), and Au(111) are shown in Figure 3. For Au and Ag, the long molecular axis
is parallel to the ⟨1 1̲0⟩ direction (configuration
1), while for Cu it is parallel to the ⟨12̲1⟩
direction (configuration 2). The difference in the adsorption geometry
is due to the smaller lattice parameter of Cu: In the gas phase, the
four nitrogen atoms of TCNQ form a rectangle of 8.34 Å ×
4.43 Å. In the Ag(111) surface, the four silver atoms directly
underneath the N form a rectangle (before adsorption) of 8.67 Å
(+4.0%) × 5.00 Å (+12.9%). For Au(111), the numbers are
8.80 Å (+5.51%) × 5.08 Å (+14.67%). For Cu(111), the
corresponding distances in this same adsorption geometry would be
7.56 Å (−9.4%) × 4.37 Å (−1.4%). However,
for the minimum energy configuration, the rectangle formed by the
copper atoms underneath the N atoms has dimensions of 8.73 Å
(+4.7%) × 5.04 Å (+13.8%). Although the van der Waals contribution
always favors configuration 1, this small difference is enough to
change the minimum energy configuration and seems to be related not
only to the lattice misfit but also to the sign of this misfit since
the more electronegative part of the TCNQ molecule, and hence the
more reactive part, is directed outward the nitrogen atoms (Figure 1). The difference
in adsorption energy between the two configurations, however, is rather
small (≈0.12 eV), in accordance with previous results.46

Figure 3 Top and side views of the calculated minimum energy adsorption
geometry of TCNQ on Cu(111), Ag(111), and Au(111).

Figure 3 also
shows
that, in all cases, the molecule is clearly bent, with the carbon
ring parallel to the metal surface and the cyano groups pointing toward
the metal atoms underneath. Figure 4 shows a summary of the main distances characterizing
the adsorption of TCNQ on the different surfaces: z(C), the height of the central C ring above the average surface plane; z(N), the height of the four nitrogen atoms above the average
surface plane; d(C–N), the vertical distance
between the central C ring and the N atoms; and Δz, the maximum height of the metal atoms above the average surface
plane (not to be confused with the total rumpling of the metal surface,
the maximum height difference between the atoms of the top metal surface,
which is 0.35 Å for Cu, 0.24 Å for Ag, and 0.21 Å in
the case of Au. The total rumpling of the second metal layer is much
smaller: 0.082, 0.066, and 0.068, respectively). The figure shows
that the height of the molecular core above the metal surface is approximately
the same (3.2–3.4 Å) in all cases, although TCNQ is slightly
closer to the surface than F4-TCNQ; also, on the three surfaces the
N atoms are closer to the metal surface than the C ring, although
the bending is markedly stronger for Cu, which shows the largest difference
between the heights of the N atoms and the C ring (1.036 Å) and
the lowest distance between the N atoms and the topmost surface layer
(2.21 Å). At the same time, the interaction between the molecule
and the surface pulls out some metal atoms of the average surface
plane, especially those directly underneath the N atoms. The combinations
of the molecular bending and substrate distortion lead to a minimum
nitrogen–metal distance of 2.05 Å in the case of Cu, 2.46
Å for Ag, and 2.67 Å for Au. Note that, in the case of Cu,
this minimum Cu–N distance is very close to the sum of the
covalent radii of N and Cu,67 effectively
suggesting the formation of a true chemical bond. The results also
indicate that the adsorption geometry of F4-TCNQ on the three surfaces
is very similar to TCNQ’s (as previously reported),40 although the amount of bending is slightly larger
(see Figure 4). Experimental
results have been obtained for F4-TCNQ on Cu(111), giving a height
of 3.6 Å for the F atoms and 2.1 Å for the C atoms.38 Our results in these case give 3.4 and 2.2 Å,
respectively, in good agreement with the experiments.

Figure 4 Geometric distances characterizing
the adsorption of TCNQ and F4-TCNQ
on the Cu, Ag, and Au metal surfaces: z(C) = height
of the C atoms in the central ring above the top metal surface; z(N) = height of the N atoms above the top metal surface; d(C–N) = height difference between the N atoms and
the C in the central ring; Δz = height of the
topmost surface metal atom over the average surface plane.

Note that, in the absence of the metal surface, the bending
of
the molecule is energetically unfavorable: the energy of an isolated
TCNQ molecule with the bent configuration that it adopts on the Cu
(Ag, Au) surface is higher by 0.66 eV (0.35, 0.20 eV) than the energy
of an isolated planar gas-phase molecule; for F4-TCNQ, the numbers
are 0.64 (Cu), 0.37 (Ag), and 0.27 (Au) eV. Of course, this costly
increase in energy is more than compensated by the interaction with
the surface. Also, due to the concentration of the negative charge
on the dicyano groups, even for an isolated neutral molecule in the
gas phase, this structural distortion would create a dipole moment
of 3.2 Db in the Cu case and of ∼2.1 Db for Ag and Au (3.3,
2.25, and 2.28 Db for F4-TCNQ).

As mentioned above, the in-plane
molecular structure is also modified.
As shown in Table 1 and Figure 2 for
TCNQ, there is a partial aromatization of the C ring and a clear lengthening
of the B3 bond. In the case of the gold surface, the bond lengths
are close to those in the anion state of the isolated TCNQ molecule,
while for Ag and Cu they are very similar to the molecule’s
in the dianion form. As a whole, if the bending of the molecule implies
a strong interaction with the metal surface, the in-plane distortion
seems to indicate a partial charging of the molecule, both effects
decreasing in the order Cu, Ag, and Au.

The adsorption energies
for TCNQ (blue symbols) and F4-TCNQ (red
symbols) on the three metal surfaces calculated as Ead = (Emol + Emetal) – Emol/metal, where Emol/metal is the energy of the
complete system and Emol and Emetal, are the energies of the molecule and the metal
surfaces in their isolated, relaxed configurations, respectively,
are displayed in Figure 5 (note that the results of both calculation methods (full symbols
for DMol3; empty symbols for CASTEP) agree within ∼0.1 eV).
For TCNQ, the binding energies are 3.57, 2.80, and 1.88 eV for Cu,
Ag, and Au, respectively, which agree fairly well with values previously
reported for TCNQ on Ag(111) (2.51 eV)48 and Cu(111) (3.30–3.72 eV).46,51 For F4-TCNQ,
the binding energies are systematically larger than for TCNQ: 4.07
(Cu), 3.21 (Ag), and 2.21 eV (Au). Within the TS scheme, van der Waals
interactions (triangular symbols) are almost the same for both molecules.
Thus, the difference between TCNQ and F4-TCNQ is preserved when no
dispersion interactions are taken into account (square symbols) and
is due to the more electronegative character of the fluorine atoms.
Also, van der Waals interactions are very similar on the Ag(111) and
Au(111) surfaces, while on Cu(111) they add an additional contribution
of ∼0.4 eV to the total binding energy.

Figure 5 Calculated binding energies
upon adsorption of TCNQ (blue circles)
and F4-TCNQ (red circles) on Cu(111), Ag(111), and Au(111). The letters
in the graph labels refer to the software used in the calculations
(D = DMol3 (full symbols); C = CASTEP (empty symbols)). The square
symbols are the corresponding binding energies when van der Waals
interactions are not taken into account, while triangular symbols
indicate only the van der Waals contribution.

Figure 6 shows the
projected density of states (PDOS), calculated using the DMol3 software,
for both TCNQ (left panel) and F4-TCNQ (right panel) adsorbed on the
three metal surfaces. Very similar results (not shown) are obtained
using CASTEP. Unrestricted spin calculations were also made, but no
spin polarization was found in any case. Although broader and shifted
down in energy, by comparing with the densities of states calculated
for the isolated gas-phase molecules (top panels in Figure 6), the frontier-related molecular
orbitals after adsorption are easily recognized, especially for Ag
and Au. (As an example, Figure 7 shows two different isosurfaces for those electronic levels
assigned to the HOMO- and LUMO-related orbitals in the TCNQ/Ag(111)
system). Note, however, that the hybridization of the molecular orbitals
with the metal states is much larger for Cu where the HOMO-related
orbital is barely distinguished. In the case of Ag and Cu, the LUMO-related
orbital falls well below the Fermi level, while for Au it seems to
be only partially occupied.

Figure 6 Projected density of states of TCNQ (left) and
F4-TCNQ (right)
when adsorbed on Cu(111), Ag(111), and Au(111). The energy scale is
referred to the Fermi level. In both cases, the top panels show the
density of states for the neutral isolated molecule. In these graphs,
the energy scale is referred to the position of the HOMO orbital.
The dashed lines indicate the proposed correspondence between the
molecular orbitals and the orbitals after adsorption.

Figure 7 Two isosurfaces, corresponding to an electron density of 0.004
electrons/Å3, for those electron levels with an energy
between (a) −1.51 and −1.03 eV and (b) −0.47
and 0.04 eV in the case of TCNQ/Ag(111). The resemblance with the
HOMO and LUMO orbitals, respectively, of the TCNQ molecule (see Figure 1) seems clear.

The rearrangement of the electron density at the
molecule/metal
interface can be visualized by looking at the density difference graphs
displayed in Figure 8. These graphs are obtained by substracting the charge densities
of the isolated systems from the charge density of the combined system 1  where ρTCNQ and ρM(111) (M stands
for the different metals)
are the charge densities of the individual systems calculated with
the geometry they adopt in the combined system ρTCNQ/M(111). The graphs in Figure 8 show the top and side views of three such density difference isosurfaces,
corresponding to an electron density difference of 0.01 electrons/Å3 in which the red areas show places where the electron density
has been enriched while the blue areas show where the density has
been depleted. By comparing with the shape of the orbitals for the
gas-phase isolated molecule (Figure 1), it can be concluded that the LUMO-related orbital
is almost completely occupied after adsorption, approximately by the
same amount, in Cu and Ag, but it is only partially filled on Au.
The electrons come mainly from a region slightly above the surface
plane close to the metal atoms underneath the N atoms. There is also
electron depletion in the bonds that lengthen upon adsorption (B1,
B3, and B5, see Figure 2). The graphs clearly show that there is some amount of electron
backdonation, much larger for the copper surface than for silver and
gold. This can be also visualized by making cuts of the electron density
difference along planes parallel to the metal surface. Figure 9 shows one of these cuts across
the topmost metal plane. There are regions on the metal surface, especially
in the case of copper, that have gained electrons after the molecular
adsorption. These results agree with previous calculations that show
that, in the F4-TCNQ case, backdonation comes mainly from the orbitals
HOMO-9 to HOMO-12, which are mainly localized around the cyano groups
(explaining the lengthening of the B5 bond).40

TCNQ adsorption on Cu(111), Ag(111), and Au(111). The isosurfaces
drawn correspond to an electron density difference of 0.01 electrons/Å3. The red areas show where the electron density has been enriched,
while the blue areas show where the density has been depleted.

Figure 9 Horizontal cuts of the electron density difference across
the topmost
metal plane. Regions of electron depletion are depicted in blue, while
areas of electron enrichment are drawn in red. The color scale goes
from −0.01 to 0.01 electrons/Å3.

As a consequence of electron backdonation, the net amount
of charge
transfer cannot be interpreted directly as a sign of the strength
of the molecule–metal interaction and is not directly correlated
to the binding energy. The amounts of charge transfer, calculated
using both the DMol3 and CASTEP software, are shown in Figure 10. For the two calculation
methods, we have followed the Hirshfeld68 partition system of the electron density. In addition, in the case
of DMol3, we have also used the Mulliken analysis.69 Both the Mulliken and Hirshfeld methods calculate a very
similar charge transfer for Cu and Ag, while in the case of Au the
Hirshfeld charge is noticeably larger (0.3–0.4 e) than the
Mulliken charge. However, it is well known that the different partition
schemes can give very different partial charges,70 and so, only the relative trends between the three metal
surfaces are really meaningful. From the results, we can conclude
that, in three cases, the charge transferred to the F4-TCNQ molecule
is somewhat larger than the charge transferred to TCNQ. Also, the
charge transfer seems to be largest in the case of Ag and slightly
less for Cu and Au (which agrees with previous results published for
F4-TCNQ).40 The similarity between Cu and
Au, however, can be somewhat misleading. The charge transfer in Au
is due to the LUMO orbital being only partially occupied. In Cu, however,
the LUMO is completely filled, but there is a considerable amount
of electron backdonation to the metal. Ag, on the other hand, is an
intermediate case: the LUMO is also completely filled, but the amount
of backdonation is smaller than that in Cu.

Figure 10 Calculated charge transfer
upon adsorption of TCNQ (left) and F4-TCNQ
(right) on Cu(111), Ag(111), and Au(111). The letters in the graph
labels refer to the software used in the calculations (D = DMol3;
C = CASTEP).

The calculated work functions
after adsorption are shown in Figure 11. The change in
work function has two different origins. The first one, the so-called
molecular contribution, is due to the possible existence of molecular
dipolar moments. As mentioned above, although TCNQ and F4-TCNQ are
planar molecules when isolated, with no dipolar moment, due to the
concentration of the negative charge on the dicyano groups, the structural
distortion suffered upon adsorption creates a dipole moment even in
the absence of charge transfer. This dipole points away from the surface
and thus tends to decrease the work function of the substrate. The
second origin is the rearrangement of the electron density at the
interface: charge transfer from the substrate to the molecule tends
to increase the work function. The contribution of both effects makes
the change in the work functions of Cu and Ag to be very small but
larger for Ag due to the larger amount of charge transfer.

Figure 11 Calculated
work functions upon adsorption of TCNQ (left) and F4-TCNQ
(right) on Cu(111), Ag(111), and Au(111).

The results presented here agree qualitatively with most of the
available theoretical and experimental data, the only significant
discrepancy being the TCNQ/Au(111) system, where the experimental
results point to a physisorbed state with null charge transfer39 and a work function decrease.44,55 This discrepancy is related to the so-called energy gap problem.71,72 Although the combination GGA-PBE is used in many studies of molecular
adsorption on metal surfaces, it is well known that the PBE functional
underestimates the band gaps of semiconductors and insulators and,
in particular, the HOMO–LUMO band gaps of organic molecules.
However, it has been shown that, when dealing with metal–organic
interfaces (especially in the case of copper and silver), image potential
effects and polarization effects can compensate the self-interaction
corrections origin of this energy gap problem.73,74 The TCNQ/Au(111) system must be a limiting case, since already for
F4-TCNQ/Au(111) the experimental results indicate a certain amount
of charge transfer31 and a work function
increase,55 in accordance with our calculations.
This is demonstrated in Figure 12, which shows the density of states (DOS) of the TCNQ
and F4-TCNQ molecules together with the DOS of the clean metal surfaces.
When using the PBE functional, the LUMO orbitals of both molecules
fall below the Fermi level of the three metal surfaces but only by
∼0.2 eV for TCNQ on Au(111). For the remaining systems, this
shifting does not modify significantly our conclusions.

gas-phase molecules using two different functionals (PBE, B3LYP) and
of (c–e) the clean metal surfaces (only PBE).
The common origin of energies is the vacuum level VL. The green vertical lines indicate the Fermi levels
of the three metals. The dashed vertical lines are guides to
the eye.

Among other alternatives, the
use of hybrid orbitals, which combine
the generalized gradient functional with the exact (Hartree–Fock)
exchange, helps to solve this energy gap problem.75 For example, if the molecular DOS are calculated using
the hybrid B3LYP functional, the energy gap widens by ∼1.1
eV and the LUMO orbital shifts ∼0.5 upward in energy, falling
above the gold Fermi energy, in agreement with the experimental results
for TCNQ/Au(111). Unfortunately, the B3LYP functional fails for bulk
metals,76 and other options are computationally
much more demanding. Thus, the results presented here, especially
those regarding charge transfer between the metals and the molecules,
are to be taken only as guides to understand the general trends.

Conclusions
In summary, we have carried out a computational dispersion-corrected
DFT study of the adsorption of isolated TCNQ and F4-TCNQ molecules
on the Cu(111), Ag(111), and (unreconstructed) Au(111) surfaces. It
seems clear from the results that the molecule–substrate interaction
decreases in the order Cu > Ag > Au. Although this sequence
seems
fairly intuitive, it is convenient to remind that the interaction
is strongly molecular-dependent. For example, in the case of TTF (tetrathiafulvalene)77 or DIP (diindenoperylene),78 the adsorption energies follow Cu > Au > Ag; meanwhile,
for viologen77 and triarylamines,79 the order is Au > Cu > Ag. In our case,
being
TCNQ and F4-TCNQ relatively small molecules with a strong acceptor
character, the weaker interaction with the gold surface seems to be
related to the higher work function, while the difference between
Ag and Cu lies on the amount of backdonation.

Computational Details
DFT calculations were carried out using the DMol3 package integrated
in the Material Studio program of Accelrys Inc.80,81 The electron exchange and correlation energies were treated with
the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew, Burke, and
Ernzerhof.82 The valence electron functions
were expanded to a set of numerical atomic orbitals by a double-numerical
basis with polarization functions (DNP), (a polarization d function
on all the non-hydrogen atoms and a polarization p function on all
the hydrogen atoms). The cutoff radius was set to Rc = 5.3 Å. DFT semicore pseudopotentials (DSPP),83 which include some degree of relativistic effects,
were used for Cu, Ag, and Au. The Tkatchenko and Scheffler (TS) scheme84 for dispersion correction was also included.
The convergence criteria were as follows: SCF tolerance, 2 ×
10–5 eV; maximum displacement, 2 × 10–3 Å; maximum force, 2.7 × 10–2 eV/Å;
and total energy, 2 × 10–5 eV. Under these
conditions, the lattice parameters of bulk Cu, Ag, and Au are 3.564,
4.113, and 4.146 Å, in close agreement (within −1.41,
0.68, and 1.66%, respectively) with the experimental values (3.615,
4.085, and 4.078 Å).

The metal surfaces were simulated
by a repeated six layers slab
where the four bottom layers were kept frozen, with a lateral 6 ×
7 supercell and a unit cell length in a perpendicular direction of
50 Å, in order to avoid the interaction between adjacent structures.
Thus, due to the high computational cost, we are neglecting the long-range
order imposed by the herringbone reconstruction of the gold surface.85 Nevertheless, it has been shown that many organic
molecules, including strong acceptors like (the closely related) TCNE86 or PCBM,87 tend to
nucleate on the fcc areas of the reconstruction, which is what we
are simulating here. The Brillouin zone was sampled by 8 × 7
× 3 Monkhorst–Pack mesh.88 The
values of the work functions for the clean metal surfaces, calculated
using the Neugebauer–Scheffler dipole correction,89 are 4.76 eV for Cu(111), 4.27 eV for Ag(111),
and 5.21 eV for Au(111), which agree fairly well with previous results.90,91

Once the adsorption geometries were fully relaxed, the electronic
structure calculations were repeated using the CASTEP package also
included in the Materials Studio program.92 In this case, ultrasoft pseudopotentials with the PBE funcional
and the TS scheme for dispersion correction were used.93 The plane wave basis set was expanded to a 360
eV kinetic energy cutoff, and a 2 × 2 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack
grid was used.
