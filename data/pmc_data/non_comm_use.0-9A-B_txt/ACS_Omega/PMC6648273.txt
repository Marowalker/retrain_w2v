Two-dimensional metal carbides or
nitrides (MXenes) demonstrated
wide applications in energy storage, water treatment, electromagnetic
shielding, gas/biosensing, and photoelectrochemical catalysis due
to their higher specific surface area and excellent conductivity.
They also have the advantages of flexible and adjustable components
and controllable minimum nanolayer thickness. In this study, a cube-like
Co3O4 particle-modified self-assembled MXene
(Ti3C2) nanocomposite has been prepared successfully
by a simple solvothermal method. The Co3O4 particles
are well dispersed on the surface and inner layers of the Ti3C2 sheets, which effectively prevent the restacking of
Ti3C2 sheets and form an organized composite
structure. The physical properties of these nanocomposites were studied
by using XRD, SEM, EDX, TEM, and XPS. The performance of the obtained
samples was evaluated as new nanocatalysts for degrading methylene
blue and Rhodamine B in batch model experiments. The prepared Mxene-Co3O4 nanocomposites can be well regenerated and reused
for eight consecutive cycles, indicating potential wide applications
in wastewater treatment and composite materials.

1 Introduction
Two-dimensional materials
have unique electrical, optical, and
mechanical properties. MXene is a new type of two-dimensional crystalline
compound with graphene-like structure and novel properties.1 It is one of the stars in the field of functional
materials research in recent years. It is peeled off by MAX phase
etching.2 The MAX phase is a ternary-layered
carbide or nitride material that combines the properties of both metals
and ceramics.3 The MAX phase has the general
formula Mn+1AXn, where M is a transition metal element, A is mainly a group IIIA
or IVA element, X is carbon and/or nitrogen, and n = 1, 2, or 3. So far, more than 70 MAX phases have been discovered.4 The MAX phase is a hexagonal crystal structure,
the M atomic layer is closely packed, the X atom is filled in the
M atom octahedron, and the M atomic layer is interspersed in the A
atomic layer. It could be thought that the MAX phase is bonded by
a two-dimensional layered carbide/nitride to the A atomic layer. Among
them, M–A is a mixture of covalent bond/metal bond/ion bond,
and M–X is a covalent bond.5 Thus,
the A atomic layer is removed by etching, and a two-dimensional MXene
nanosheet is obtained by liquid phase stripping.6,7 In
addition, the thickness of a single MXene layer can reach 1 nm, and
the area diameter can reach several tens of micrometers.8 The corresponding structures of MXene are also
different from MAX phases with different n values.
Nineteen kinds of MXene have been successfully prepared, and dozens
of MXene have predictive stability in theory; this diversified structural
composition provides a broad space for its property regulation and
derivative material construction.

Moreover, the Co3O4 crystal exhibited a normal
spinel structure, namely, Co2+(Co3+)2O2–4, where O2– is
in a densely packed cubic structure, Co2+ is located in
its tetrahedral gap, and Co3+ is located in its octahedral
gap with higher crystal field stabilization energy. When the air is
lower than 800 °C, the properties are very stable. At room temperature,
it is not easily soluble in various concentrated acids and water but
could be dissolved in a hot sulfuric acid solution at a lower rate.
In addition, it is also a p-type semiconductor material. It also has
a very wide range of applications, such as sensors,9 supercapacitors,10 catalysts,11−19 magnetic semiconductors,20 and rechargeable
battery materials.21−23 For example, Huang et al. synthesized silver nanoparticle-modified MXene composites by self-reduction
reactions with enhanced catalytic performances.11 Yang et al. used a simple pyrolysis method to prepare Co3O4 nanoparticles/nitrogen-doped carbon composites
with different structures for oxygen evolution.12 Chen et al. skillfully used a multistep method to synthesize
mesoporous Co3O4 and carbon nanotube composites
with a layered pipe structure as a negative electrode material for
lithium ion batteries.13 This unique nanostructure
solved the problem of volume expansion and low electron conductivity
of metal oxide anodes.24 Moreover, some
similar composites exhibit excellent performance in electrochemistry
and wide applications.25−31

Dyes are widely used in various industries, among which methylene
blue (MB) is often used in the printing and dye industry as an important
target for wastewater treatment.32−39 It is reported to be carcinogenic and mutagenic, which may be harmful
to plants and animals. Rhodamine B (RhB) is also a kind of widely
used dye. Therefore, the removal of MB and RhB from wastewater causes
widespread concern. Herein, we proposed to synthesize Co3O4 particle-modified MXene (Mxene-Co3O4) nanocomposites by an in situ solvothermal method. The Co3O4 nanocomposites were uniformly anchored on the
surface of Ti3C2 sheets, which enhanced the
catalytic activity. At the same time, the close interaction between
the Co3O4 component and the Ti3C2 substrate promoted the performance improvement of the catalyst.
The prepared Mxene-Co3O4 nanocomposites showed
good performance for catalytic degradation of methylene blue and Rhodamine
B as model dyes. The present work on Mxene-Co3O4 nanocomposites had demonstrated a new clue for the research field
of MXene composite catalysis.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of MXene-Co3O4 Nanocomposites
Herein, the targeted sheet-like nanomaterial
MXene-Co3O4 was prepared by a simple solvothermal
method, as shown in Figure 1. The first part is the synthesis of Mxene-Co3O4 composites. MXene was made of Ti3AlC2 type MAX ceramics and etched with a mixed solution of HCl (6 M)
and LiF (2.5 M) in aqueous solution under ultrasonication. The other
part is the catalytic degradation of dyes, such as methylene blue
(MB) and Rhodamine B (RhB), by MXene-Co3O4 nanocomposites.
In this work, we chose two catalysts, namely, MXene-Co3O4 and Co3O4, and then selected
the catalyzed dyes.

Figure 1 Schematic illustration of the synthesis and catalytic
process of
MXene-Co3O4 nanocomposites.

Figure 2 shows
the
microscopic morphology of MXene-Co3O4, Co3O4, and MXene. From Figure 2a,b, it could be seen that MXene had a well-fabricated
accordion morphology. Pure Co3O4 showed a small
cube type, which had an average crystallite size of 20 nm. Figure 2c,d shows the TEM
and SEM images of the MXene-Co3O4 composites.
It could be clearly seen that the surface of MXene was coated with
a large amount of Co3O4 particles, and a small
amount of Co3O4 could enter the layer of MXene,
which indicated that this is beneficial to the catalytic degradation
of methylene blue and Rhodamine B. It could be explained that the
formed MXene-Co3O4 composite has a larger specific
surface area, which was advantageous for the adsorption of dyes and
could be used for catalytic experiments. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX)
spectroscopy (inset in Figure 2c) confirms that the elemental composition of the composite
consists solely of carbon, titanium, cobalt, and oxygen, whose proportions
were consistent to form MXene-Co3O4. In addition, Figure 3 describes the elemental
mappings of the prepared MXene-Co3O4 composite.
According to C, Ti, and Co images, the data further illustrated the
good distribution of the Co element on the surface of MXene after
the successful solvothermal process.

X-ray powder diffraction (XRD)
analysis identifies the formation
of MXene-Co3O4 nanocomposites, as shown in Figure 4. A set of (111),
(110), (223), and (440) peaks at 17.9, 25.1, 59.8, and 64.6°
appeared, respectively. The disappearance of the (006) peak from Ti3C2 MXene suggested the suppressed restacking of
MXene sheets by the Co3O4 nanostructure standing
on its surface (Figure 2c). The other peaks originated from MXene were quite weak even in
pristine MXene, for being easily overlapped by the signals from the
Co3O4 nanostructure. After the Co3O4 assembly process, three distinct characteristic peaks
of Co3O4 particles could also be found in the
formed composite, that is, (111), (511), and (440) crystal planes
(JCPDS number 090418), indicating that a large number of Co3O4 particles were adsorbed on the surface of the MXene
during the solvothermal treatment process.

Figure 4 XRD curves of as-prepared
MXene, MXene-Co3O4, and Co3O4.

The thermogravimetric curve showed
that the mass changes with the
change of temperature, as shown in Figure 5. While Co3O4 was relatively
stable in the test temperature range, the weight loss was attributed
to the change in Ti3C2. It could be concluded
from the curve that the weight loss of as-prepared MXene-Co3O4 composites from room temperature to 200 °C was
mainly due to the adsorption of water. When the temperature was gradually
increased, the weight loss was mainly due to the decomposition of
the oxygen-containing functional groups in which the Co3O4 and MXene complexes were bonded to each other and the
decomposition of Ti3C2.

MXene-Co3O4 nanocomposites.

Moreover, Figure 6 shows the XPS spectra of MXene and the MXene-Co3O4 composite. Figure 6a shows the characteristic peaks in the curve of the
MXene-Co3O4 nanocomposite, such as Co2p, O1s,
C1s, and Ti2p.
Compared with pure MXene, the peak of O1s of MXene-Co3O4 increased obviously. It could be seen that the results of
XPS are consistent with the Co, C, Ti, and O elements in the elemental
EDX analysis. In addition, for the Co2p XPS spectrum in Figure 6b, it showed a low energy band
(Co2p3/2). This low energy band could be convolved into
two peaks: 779.8 and 781.3 eV.40,41 The Co2p3/2 peak position (Figure 6b) was in accordance with the presence of Co3O4.42 The analysis results were consistent
with XRD, which proved the generation of Co3O4.

2.2 Catalytic
Performances of MXene-Co3O4 Nanocomposites
The catalytic performance of
the obtained composites was assessed by catalytic reduction of model
dyes. In the present study, the catalytic reaction was carried out
in a 250 mL glass flask containing 100 mL of MB dye solution (12.5
mg/L) or 100 mL of RhB (5 mg/L) and 10 mg of catalyst in the presence
of 15 mL of H2O2 (30%) at room temperature with
continuous stirring. The supernatant was centrifuged at given time
intervals, and the residual dye concentrations at different time intervals
were investigated by UV–visible spectroscopy using different
absorption wavelengths (MB 664 nm, RhB 554 nm). In this study, catalytic
reductions of MB or RhB from Co3O4 particles
and MXene-Co3O4 composites were also investigated.
Meanwhile, the dye removal rate was calculated according to the following
formula: K (%) = (A0 – AT)/A0 × 100,43 where K is defined
as the dye removal rate, A0 is defined
as the initial absorbance of the supernatant of the dye solution, and AT is defined as the absorbance of the supernatant of the dye solution
collected at different intervals.

In order to compare the performance
of the synthesized catalyst, we evaluated the effects of catalytic
degradation of dyes (MB and RhB) using two catalysts, respectively.
The adsorption kinetic experiments of the as-prepared nanocomposites
were carried out using the results of RhB and MB, as shown in Figures 7 and 8. It could be seen that, for MXene-Co3O4, the removal rates of MB and RhB were stabilized in about 240 and
80 min, respectively, indicating that the prepared complex acted as
an effective dye adsorbent. For Co3O4, the MB
and RhB removal rates reached stable values in about 200 and 1200
min, respectively. When H2O2 was not added,
it was clear that the catalyst could hardly degrade the dyes.

on RhB (a,b) and MB (c,d) at 298 K.

Figure 8 Adsorption kinetic curves of as-prepared Co3O4 particles on RhB (a,b) and MB (c,d) at 298 K.

In addition, the adsorption kinetic process could be described
by classical kinetic models as follows: The pseudo-first-order model
could be represented by eq 1 1  The pseudo-second-order model
could be represented by eq 2 2  where qe is the equilibrium adsorption capacity (mg/g), qt is the adsorption capacity at time t (mg/g), and k1 and k2 values are the kinetic rate constants.44−47

At the same time, Table 1 clearly shows the kinetic results of the experimental
data,
and the respective fitting parameters were obtained. As shown in Figure 7, by comparing the
linear fitting parameters, the pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order
kinetics of MB and RhB were catalyzed by MXene-Co3O4 and Co3O4. Based on the above data,
it could be easily observed that the obtained MXene-Co3O4 composite showed the best adsorption capacity, which
could be related to the synergy effect between MXene and Co3O4.

2.3 Reasonable Activation Mechanisms of H2O2
The discovery of antibiotics derived
from natural products has aroused
global attention. A promising and challenging method of antibiotic
degradation is the Fenton method. This reaction can be carried out
at neutral pH, which was an important advantage. A study on oxidative
degradation of organic dyes with H2O2 had been
reported previously.16 However, the exact
mechanism for dye decomposition with H2O2 remains
unclear. According to a previous study, cobalt-based Fenton/Fenton-like
processes could be performed at neutral pH.18 On the one hand, it was found that homogeneous Co2+/H2O2 systems were able to degrade dye contaminants
without controlling pH completely.19 On
the other hand, the catalytic decomposition of organic contaminants
by heterogeneous Co catalysts under the condition of adding H2O2 was also investigated. In a recent study, Co2+ adsorbed alumina was used as a heterogeneous catalyst to
degrade methylene blue and methyl orange.17 In those cases, the Co-based heterogeneous catalyst could effectively
degrade contaminants at neutral or even alkaline pH. Co-based heterogeneous
catalysts could effectively degrade the pollutants at neutral or even
basic pH. 3   4   5  

In
contrast, HO• produced by Co2+ mediated
H2O2 activation has been recorded in only a
few studies.18,21 The HO• formation
mechanism by Co could be proposed as reactions 3–5. As shown
in reaction 3, HO• played an important role in the Co(II)/Co(III) cycle.
The ability of MXene-Co3O4 in the catalytic
process of MB could be attributed to the positive synergistic effect
of MXene, MB, and Co3O4 with the aid of H2O2. First, the cationic MB molecules were easily
adsorbed to the surface of MXene due to electrostatic attraction,
and the functional groups such as −F and −OH that were
rich on the surface of MXene also endowed the excellent catalytic
ability during the chemical reaction process.

This adsorption
significantly improved the effective concentration
of MB molecules anchored on the surface of MXene-Co3O4, leading to a high catalytic degradation rate. Second, the
hydrophilicity of MXene made the MXene-Co3O4 complex well dispersed in water. Good contact between Co3O4 nanocomposites and MXene prevented Co3O4 from falling off during the catalytic process. The H2O2 was then effectively catalyzed to produce free •OH radical species and ultimately promote degradation
of the MB molecules. Hence, in terms of MXene-Co3O4 composites, there was a coupling between adsorption and catalytic
reactions in a single process.23 Compared
to bare MXene and Co3O4, the degradations of
MB and RhB were significantly increased.

Compared to other nanoparticle
catalysts reported, the present
prepared composite catalyst could be recovered readily from the solution.48 After reaching the adsorption equilibrium in
the reaction solution, the recovered MXene-Co3O4 composite was treated by a thorough cleaning procedure to eliminate
possible dye residues and regenerate the catalyst. Through repeated
adsorption by using the same catalyst and fresh dye solutions, it
could be used in eight consecutive cycles (Figure 9). The results showed that, after eight consecutive
cycles, the MB removal rate was maintained at about 92.37%. The obtained
nanocomposites performed well in terms of stability and recyclability.
In addition, the reduction of MB degradation could be attributed to
the loss and aggregation of the catalyst in the recycling process,
as well as the adsorption of MB or intermediates. The above data indicated
that the synthesized catalyst could potentially be utilized in pollutant
treatment.

cycles.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully synthesized a Co3O4 nanocrystal-loaded MXene composite by simple in situ
solvothermal synthesis. Due to its simple and mild reaction conditions,
this simple in situ synthesis method could also be applied to the
synthesis of other MXene-based transition metal oxides. The present
obtained MXene-Co3O4 nanostructure has a very
high MB and RhB degradation capacity and well repeatability. After
eight consecutive catalytic cycles, the catalytic properties of the
sample were still good, showing that the stability and repeatability
of Mxene-Co3O4 nanocomposites were satisfying.
The possible mechanism for adsorbing methylene blue and Rhodamine
B to Mxene-Co3O4 and Co3O4 has been proposed, respectively. The research work showed that the
obtained nanocomposites have good and wide applications as new catalytic
composite materials.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Ti3C2 (MXene) is obtained
by etching a mixed solution of HCl (6 M) and
LiF (2.5 M) using Ti3AlC2 as a raw material.

Deionized (DI) water was used in all experiments.

4.2 Synthesis of the MXene-Co3O4 Nanocomposites
Original MXene (20 mg) was dissolved
in 4 mL of ultrapure water, and the mixture was sonicated for 0.5
h. Then, 2 mL of 0.2 M Co(Ac)2 solution was added dropwise,
20 mL of ethanol was added, and the solution was magnetically stirred
for 2 h. Then, the above reaction solution was poured into a 100 mL
Teflon-lined steel autoclave. The autoclave was then heated at 120
°C for 8 h. After cooling down to room temperature and centrifugation,
the final obtained precipitate was washed three times with ethanol
and lyophilized to obtain the desired MXene-Co3O4 composites.

4.3 Preparation of Co3O4 Nanoparticles
The synthesis of pure Co3O4 samples was similar to the preparation of MXene-Co3O4 by reducing the addition of MXene of the same
quality.
Ethanol (20 mL) was added to 2 mL of 0.2 M Co(Ac)2 solution
and stirred for 2 h. Then, the mixture was transferred to a 100 mL
steel autoclave reactor and heated at 120 °C for 8 h.

4.4 Characterization
Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) was tested in an argon environment by a NETZSCH STA
409 PC Luxx simultaneous thermal analyzer (Netzsch Instruments Manufacturing
Co., Ltd., Germany). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured
by the Thermo Scientific ESCALab 250Xi with an Al Kα X-ray source.
The adsorption experiments were monitored by using a Shimadzu UV2550
spectrophotometer. All aqueous solutions were prepared with water
purified in a double-stage Millipore Milli-Q Plus purification system.
The morphologies were obtained by using a transmission electron microscope
(TEM) (HT7700, Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation, Japan) with
an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis
was recorded with an X-ray diffractometer (SMART LAB, Rigaku, Japan).
The microstructures of the samples were characterized by using a field-emission
scanning electron microscope (SEM) (S-4800II, Hitachi, Japan) equipped
with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Absorption spectra
were measured with a LabTech UV-2100 ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis)
spectrophotometer.

4.5 Catalytic Test of MXene-Co3O4 Nanocomposites
In order to evaluate
the catalytic
performance of the obtained materials, we assessed the performance
by degradation of methylene blue and Rhodamine B.49,50 The prepared Mxene-Co3O4 composites (10 mg)
and 15 mL of H2O2 solution (30% in water) were
added to the Rhodamine B and methylene blue solution. A small sample
amount of the suspension was taken at regular intervals, and the absorbance
of the sample was measured by using a UV–vis spectrophotometer.
Moreover, cyclic stability of the catalyst was evaluated by eight
replicate experiments. At time t (min), the dye adsorption
amount qt (mg/g) per unit mass of catalyst
was calculated by the following formula 6  where C0 is the initial concentration of the adsorption solution (mg/L), Ct is the concentration of the adsorption solution
at time t (mg/L), m is the total
amount of the sample (g), and V is the volume of
the adsorption solution (L).
