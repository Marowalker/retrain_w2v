Roscovitine is an antitumor purine
inhibitor of cyclin-dependent
kinase CDK5, for which it displays submicromolar affinity. It reached
phase IIb clinical trials in 2007. The search for analogues with improved
kinase affinities led recently to an isomer, finisterine, having a
nearly 10-fold greater affinity for both CDK5 and CDK9. It solely
differs by the displacement of one nitrogen atom in the purine ring,
from position 6 to position 9. This has no incidence on the intermolecular
interaction of either drug with the neighboring sites that anchor
the ring in the recognition site. Quantum chemistry calculations combined
with conformational and topological analyses of the impact of the
purine ring isomerization of roscovitine and finisterine on its conformational
stability show that the modified electronic conjugation, on the other
hand, results in a stiffening of the rotational barrier around the
extracyclic C–NH bond of finisterine, vicinal to N9, and to
which an aryl ring is connected, along with a loosening of the barrier
around an extracyclic C6–C bond connecting to a shorter, hydrophobic
arm. The first effect is proposed to lead to a lesser hydration entropy
of solvation in the case of finisterine, thus to a facilitated desolvation
term in the overall energy balances.

Introduction
Roscovitine (Figure 1A, left compound)
is a submicromolar inhibitor of cyclin-dependent
kinases (CDKs)1 (reviews: refs (2−4)), which has been in clinical trials against various
cancers.5−8 It has been evaluated against a large variety of other diseases,
such as stroke,9 Parkinson’s disease,10 Alzheimer’s disease (L.H. Tsai, personal
communication), cranial trauma,11 pain
signaling,12 various viral infections,13 polycystic kidney disease,14,15 glomerulonephritis,16−19 glaucoma,20,21 Lambert–Eaton syndrome,22,23 deafness,24 Timothy syndrome,25,26 fibrosis,27 Cushing disease,28,29 and diabetes.30 Roscovitine is now reaching
clinical trials against Cushing disease,31 rheumatoid arthritis,32 and cystic fibrosis.33,34 The search for even more efficient inhibitors replaced the benzyl
arm at the C1 position by aryl-pyridine (1, Figure 1A, middle compound)
and, similarly, to an aryl-pyridine analogue of roscovitine isomer
of 1 (2, Figure 1A, right compound, finisterine), has an order
of magnitude smaller IC50 than 1(35,36) for the inhibition of CDK5 and CDK9. Yet, the sole change is a displacement
in the purine ring of a nitrogen atom from position 6 to position
9 and its concomitant replacement at 6 by a C atom (Figure 1A, green circles). The X-ray
structure of the CDK9-compound 1 (compound designated
originally as CR8) complex37 shows that
the sole polar interactions of the purine ring is the double H-bond
of its N8 and its C1-connected NH group with the NH and CO of the
Phe105 main-chain. Isomerization of the 6 and 9 positions leading
to 2 is unlikely to impact the magnitude of such an interaction.
All other interactions of the purine ring take place with hydrophobic
residues. These involve Ile 25, Phe 103, and Phe 105 on one side of
the plane and Leu 156 on the other side. Such interactions are insensitive
to local electronic rearrangements of the ring. Should, then, the
10-fold enhancement have another cause than actual differences of
CDK5–ligand interaction energies?

the IC50 (μM) values for the inhibitions of four
CDK kinases: CDK1, CDK2, CDK5, and CDK9. (B) Structures of the scaffold
(purine ring) corresponding to compounds 1 and 2. The junctional bonds connecting the scaffold with the rest
of the molecule are marked with a red bar and noted φ3, φ4,
and φ6 (depicting junctional bonds C1–N, C3–N,
and N6/C6–C, respectively).

If the ligand–CDK interaction energies were equal
or closely
comparable, a possible difference in the solvation energies of the
two ligands could provide a ready explanation because a lesser solvation
energy of 2 than 1 would favor it in the
energy balances. Using the C-PCM method,38,39 we have thus compared the continuum solvation energies of the two
rings. The purine ring of 2 has a lesser ΔGsolv than that of 1, namely −13.9
kcal/mol as compared to −15.1, consistent with the 1.4 kcal/mol
complexation free energy difference related to the 10-fold IC50 decrease. It could, however, be questioned whether a ΔGsolv difference computed for the sole purine
rings is accountable for the true difference of the solvation energies
of 1 and 2 in their entireties. In these,
the three substituents at positions 1, 3, and 6 could to a large extent
shield the purine ring from the solvent, thus reducing this difference.
Comparisons of the free energies of solvation of 1 and 2 in explicit water, by either molecular dynamics (MD) or
Monte-Carlo, can therefore be necessary. As a prerequisite for such
simulations by quantum chemistry (QC)-based force-field approaches,40,41 it is necessary to first calibrate the rotation barriers around
each of the three torsion angles by QC (Figure 1B). We report below the results of conformational
QC calculations. These illustrate the impact of varying the purine
ring conjugation on conformational flexibilities, and this in turn
should impact the comparative energy balances.

Results and Discussion
We denote by φ3, φ4, and φ6 the torsion angles
around the bond connecting to the aryl, ethanolamine, and isopropyl
substituents, respectively (see Figure 1B). Eighteen 15° stepwise rotations were done,
and the intramolecular energies were computed at the DFT level using
the B97-D functional42 and the aug-cc-pVTZ
basis set.43,44 The calculations were done with
the G09 software.45 Results at both the
Hartree–Fock (HF) and the Møller–Plesset (MP2)
levels are given as Supporting Information S1 and S2, respectively. The curves for the relative conformation
energies, δEconf, for rotations
around φ3, φ4, and φ6 are plotted in Figure 2A–C. The blue and the
red curves correspond to 1 and 2, respectively.

Figure 2 Conformational
energy variations upon rotations around junctional
bonds C1–N (φ3) (A), C3–N (φ4) (B), and
N6/C6–C (φ6) (C). The curves for 1 (roscovitine
derivative) and 2 (finisterine) are in blue and red,
respectively.

Although for φ3
both 1 and 2 have
superimposable curves over the 0–135 and 255–345°
ranges, there are stark differences in the 150–240° range. 1 has significantly lower δEconf values, down to 4 kcal/mol at 180°, than 2, where
it is never smaller than 12 kcal/mol. In fact the highest point for 2 in this range, at 195° (the purine ring δEconf = 20 kcal/mol), has as counterpart the
corresponding lowest point for 1 (δEconf = 4 kcal/mol). For φ4, on the other hand, both 1 and 2 have virtually superimposable curves
over the whole angular ranges. In marked contrast, for φ6 it
is now 2 that has the smallest δEconf values. These occur on both sides of the degenerate
minima at 0 and 180°.

The similar conformational behaviors
around φ4 are clearly
due to the presence of identical atoms (N2 and N4) ortho to the C3–N
torsional bond. Regarding φ6, it is noted that the torsional
bonds are a N–C one for 1 and a C–C one
for 2: thus a straightforward argument would be that
an sp lone-pair on a nitrogen as in 1 confers greater
rigidity than an sp lone-pair on a carbon, as in 2. Could
this be borne out by electronic density analyses? The case of φ3
is more involved because the torsional bond is C1–N for both 1 and 2. In contrast, in 1, C1 has
in ortho one N atom, N2, and one C atom, C9, whereas in 2 C1 has as ortho atoms N2 and N9.

These considerations led
us to resort to two types of topological
analyses: electron localization function (ELF)46−48 and noncovalent
interactions (NCIs).49,50 Regarding bond C1–NH around
which the φ3 torsions are performed, Figure 3A,B shows two green surfaces around N2 and
N8, which translate their involvement in attractive interactions.
However, concerning 2 (Figure 3B), a much more intense green surface is
observed around N8 than is the case with 1. This clearly
indicates a stronger H-bond interaction between the exacyclic NH group
and the in-plane sp doublet of N8. It occurs at φ3 = 0, which
is the global energy minimum for both 1 and 2. N9 in 2 cannot partake to the binding since it has
no sp doublet. It could only reinforce this H-bond interaction through
conjugation. This is borne out by ELF analyses, which show different
electronic localizations on N8, C9/N9, and on the extracyclic NH group.
In 2, an electronic population of 2.11 electrons is located
in a volume of 17.7 au3, hence a density of 0.12, whereas
in 1, an electronic population of 2.65 electrons is located
in a volume of 29.6 au3, hence a smaller density of 0.09.
The greater compaction of the N8 electron density in 2 than in 1 is consistent with the NCI analyses, which
are indicative of stronger interactions involving N2 in the case of 2. It is also worth noting that N9 has in 2 greater
compaction than C9 in 1, namely 7.57 electrons in a volume
of 79 au3 for N9, as compared to 5.82 electrons in a volume
of 109.3 au3 for C9. This could also contribute to reinforcing
the relative rigidity for φ3 rotations in 2 compared
to that in 1. Regarding the torsions around φ4,
the NCI and ELF analyses concur again, as shown in Supporting information S3. The NCI surfaces close to N2 have
the same amplitudes in 1 and 2, whereas
the ELF densities around bonds N2–C3, C3–N, and N–C
are virtually identical, namely 5.84 electrons in a volume of 79.
5 au3 for 1 and 5.84 electrons in a volume
of 79.3 for 2. This is fully consistent with the similar
δEconf variation amplitudes in both
ligands. Regarding the φ6 variations, NCI and ELF show contrasting
contours around N6 in 1 and C6 in 2. There
are two green surfaces on both sides of N6 in 1, in the
vicinities of N4 and C7 (Figure 4A). Such attractions should confer rigidity for rotations
around φ6. By contrast, the green surface around N4 has in 2 a much smaller extension, and there is virtually no contour
around C7 (Figure 4B). Such much smaller planar interactions of the isopropyl with the
purine ring should contribute to the much greater lability for φ6
rotations in 2. These considerations are borne out by
the ELF analyses, which show the presence of a much denser electron
distribution around N6 in 1 (Figure 4C) than around C6 in 2 (Figure 4D). Thus in 1 a total population
of 6.77 electrons is found in a volume of 61.1 au3 at the
periphery of the C5–N6, N6–C7, and N6–C (isopropyl)
bonds. In 2, the total electron population in the three
basins around C6 is much more diffuse, with 7.89 electrons in a volume
of 137.2 au3, and the three basins are disconnected.

What could be the impact, for
the comparative binding affinities
to CDK of 1 and 2, of their differing flexibilities
for rotations around bonds C1–N (φ3) and N6/C6–C
(φ6)? Rotations around C1–N govern the conformation of
the bicyclic aryl-pyridine ring. A greater lability in 1 compared to that of 2 will result in a larger entropy
component, TΔS: this concerns
both its free energy of solvation before complexation and its complexation
energy to the CDK receptor. Regarding ΔGsolv, the extended length and the partly polar nature of the
aryl-pyridyl arm are expected to thermalize more the water layers
around it with 1 than with 2, hence a larger TΔSsolv. Using QC-derived
force-fields, we plan to perform MD simulation of the solvation energies
of 1 and 2, varying the temperature around
300 K to resolve ΔGsolv into its
separate ΔHsolv and TΔSsolv components. This should
quantify the TΔSsolv difference between 1 and 2. It will then
be necessary to evaluate the extent to which this difference could
be recovered by a correspondingly larger vibration entropy upon binding
to the CDK cavity, itself depending upon the size of the aryl-pyridyl
binding pocket. We thus plan to perform MD studies on the binding
of 1 and 2 to CDK targets, as well as a
quantitative evaluation of the vibration entropy, TΔSvib, contribution to ΔG. By contrast, the larger lability for rotations around
the N6/C6–C bonds for 2 than for 1 should confer greater TΔSsolv and smaller TΔSvib to 2. However, both effects should be
lesser than in the case of the C1–N rotation, owing to the
smaller volume of the isopropyl substituent at 6 than of the aryl-pyridine
at 1, as well as its more hydrophobic nature. Alternatively, the increased
flexibility for rotations around φ6 could favor 2 over 1 in their CDK5 complexes. This is because the
two equivalent −CH3 groups of the shorter isopropyl
substituent could interact by van der Waals interactions with the
Phe 103 and Phe 105 side chains in a much larger manifold of conformations
in the case of 2, and such a stabilization would, again,
stem from entropy.

While this article was in preparation, a
paper by Nekardová
appeared,51 which compared the scoring
functions of several roscovitine derivatives with different heterocycle
scaffolds, earlier reported by this group.52 Among these compounds, a derivative with the same scaffold as finisterine
(denoted as A3) but with the same side chains as roscovitine was endowed
with a 10-fold larger inhibitory potency than roscovitine. This finding
is fully consistent with ours, the compounds reported by Nekardova
et al.51 differing by an amino-benzyl side
chain at position 1 rather than by an amino-benzyl-pyridine side chain
as in the present study. This 10-fold larger affinity could be successfully
accounted for by a correspondingly 1.5 kcal/mol larger magnitude of
the scoring function of A3 than roscovitine. Such scoring functions
were derived by energy optimizations of an ab initio quantum chemistry/semiempirical
quantum chemistry (QC/SQC) of the ligand–protein complexes
in the presence of continuum energy solvation. Energy balances were
done by subtracting the conformational energies of the ligands optimized
in the presence of continuum solvation. Entropy effects were computed
by vibrational analysis. Dynamic effects were taken into account solely
in the context of the empirical AMBER force-field, to generate ligand
conformations suitable for subsequent docking and energy optimization.
The details of the energy balances were not provided. In light of
the present analysis, it would be instructive to trace back the weight
of differential solvation free energies of roscovitine and A3 on the
energy balances. The present calculations indicate that this term
could be critical. The results by Nekardová et al.51 and the need stressed in the present article
to quantify the roles of ligand-kinase versus ligand desolvation are
an incentive for a subsequent and major step forward, namely, free
energy calculations with polarizable MD.

Conclusions and Perspectives
An aryl-pyridine derivative of roscovitine, a drug presently undergoing
clinical trials, has a submicromolar CDK-binding potency. A novel
derivative, finisterine, differs from it by a simple isomerization
of the purine ring, C9 and N6 being replaced by N9 and C6. This novel
compound, 2, has a near ten-fold higher CDK-binding affinity
than the parent compound, 1. This could not result from
a more favorable enthalpy-wise intermolecular interaction energy to
CDK. As a first step toward understanding the reasons for such a preference,
we investigated the conformational energies of 1 and 2 upon performing rotations around the three bonds connecting
the purine ring to its three substituents. The essential finding from
this study is that 1 and 2 have major differences
regarding their conformational flexibilities around two bonds: C1–N
governing the conformation of the aryl pyridine ring, and N6–C
governing the conformation of the isopopryl substituent. 2 has a much lesser conformation lability than 1 regarding
the first torsional bond, and, conversely, a much greater lability
regarding the second. These results were consistent with NCI and ELF
analyses, showing that more rigid rotation barriers corresponded to
both more extended NCI surfaces and more compact ELF densities. Rigidity
around the C1–N bond could be more critical to the overall
energy balances, as it would reduce the loss of conformational entropy
of the aryl-pyridine arm upon passing from the water solution to the
more confined CDK-binding pocket, as occurring with 2. The corresponding entropy loss regarding the isopropyl arm would
be significantly smaller on account of its smaller volume and absence
of hydrophilicity. Work is planned for MD simulations of 1 and 2 in both water and in their CDK complexes, to
unravel the TΔS contribution
to ΔG in both cases, and will be reported in
due course.

The differences in the conformational behaviors
of 1 and 2 regarding φ3 and φ6
torsion angles
are very meaningful and should justify the fact that the present study
focuses on these sole two compounds. These also imply that a preexisting
bias should favor 2 over 1 and should to
a large extent prevail over the fine details of the CDK-binding site.
This is indeed observed in Figure 1A, bearing on four CDKs, with affinity ratios in the
3.5–7 range.

We recently showed that electron substitutions
in halobenzene derivatives,
upon modifying electron density by conjugation, impacted both distributed
multipoles and distributed polarizabilities used in polarizable molecular
mechanics (PMM) approaches. This resulted in changes in the magnitude
of both PMM electrostatic and polarization contributions, fully supported
by their Coulomb and exchange-repulsion counterparts from energy decomposition
analyses.53 The present study shows that
isomerization in a conjugated ring can strongly decrease torsional
flexibility around bonds connecting to substituents, due to localized
increases of the electron density. This should in turn affect configurational
entropy in water solution and vibrational entropy in the CDK complex.
In a broader context, it could constitute a new and possibly uncharted
avenue to affect binding affinities; thus, modulating conformational
flexibility could be done by selected isomerizations and also possibly
by some electron-donating substituents at appropriate locations with
respect to the junction bond. Such effects could be quantified by
preliminary NCI, ELF, and QC conformational analyses. The derivatives
retained would subsequently lend themselves to PMM MD simulations
of their solvation in water and of their complexes with the receptor.
There does not seem to exist any precedent for such an approach.
