Zeolitic imidazolate
framework-8 (ZIF-8) has received wide attention
in recent years as a potential drug vehicle for the treatment of cancer
due to its acid-responsiveness and moderate biocompatibility. However,
its congenital deficiency of intrinsic imaging capability limits its
wider applications; therefore, a postsynthetic exchange approach was
utilized to introduce paramagnetic manganese(II) ions into the ZIF-8
matrix. As a result, bimetallic zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (Mn–Zn–ZIF)
were thus fabricated and exhibited pH-responsive T1-weighted magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) contrast effect. Remarkably, we also found
its own fluorescence derived from 2-methylimidazole, which is the
first report of the intrinsic two-photon fluorescence imaging of ZIFs
to our knowledge. Mn–Zn–ZIF still preserves the original
properties of ZIF-8 of high surface areas, microporosity, and acid
sensitivity. After further PEGylation of Mn–Zn–ZIF,
the nanoparticles showed no obvious toxicity and its MRI contrast
effect has also been enhanced. Our work highlights the promise of
modified zeolitic imidazolate frameworks as potential cancer theranostic
platforms.

Introduction
Cancer has posed deadly
threats to the health of human beings,
causing millions of deaths annually. Among several patterns of curing
cancer developed so far, chemotherapy is still the main curing method
after surgery due to the high efficacy in reducing tumor size and
eliminating tumor residues.1−5 Over the past few decades, the rapid development of nanotechnology
has helped revolutionize traditional chemotherapy. Nanosized vehicles
including liposomes,6 micelles,7 dendrimers,8 and inorganic
materials9 are broadly used as drug delivery
systems (DDS) to figure out a series of problems10−13 originating from free drugs,
such as unfavorable side effects for healthy cells, poor water solubility,
and rapid blood clearance of drugs. However, these conventional nanocarriers
have their own limitations in biomedicine; for example, liposomes,
micelles, and dendrimers usually have the disadvantage of low loading
capacities, and inorganic porous materials usually suffer from poor
degradability and unacceptable toxicity.14 Very recently, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) composed of
various organic linkers and metal joints have emerged as charming
delivery vehicles.14−17 Predominance of exceptionally high surface areas, tunable pore sizes,
potential biodegradability, and facilely tailorable functionalities
impart them superiority and prospects for applications in delivering
therapeutic agents. In particular, a subclass of MOFs, zeolitic imidazolate
framework-8 (ZIF-8), built from zinc ions and 2-methylimidazolate,
has drawn great attention with stimuli-responsive drug-controlled
release for cancer therapy;18−21 its acid-sensitivity together with moderate biocompatibility
endow the DDS with reduced systemic toxicity and enhanced anticancer
efficacy in vivo.

On the other hand, an ever-growing demand
for efficient therapeutic
strategies also requires incorporation of imaging modalities to realize
better therapeutic planning and monitoring of therapeutic responses.22 Theranostics, which integrate cancer therapy
and cancer diagnosis, have been a research hotspot for decades,23−26 and the dual applications of MOFs as drug carriers and potential
imaging agents have been widely reported,27−29 such as serving
as contrast agents (CA) for magnetic resonance (MR) image enhancement30 and two-photon fluorescence (TPF) imaging probes.22 However, limited by the properties of central
zinc ions, ZIF-8 does not possess MR imaging capability, and other
intrinsic diagnosis imaging abilities are also never reported to our
knowledge. Usually, the common idea is to combine ZIF-8 with other
imaging agents in the form of composites to attain multifunctionality;18,20,31,32 although this way has been demonstrated effective, it still had
some drawbacks such as complicated synthesis steps and reduced drug
carrier percentage. It would be encouraging to endow ZIF-8 with imaging
abilities while keeping its own crucial properties unchanged. Therefore,
these results above inspired us to make modification to ZIF-8 itself
to realize a diagnostic platform.

Herein, for incorporating
MR imaging ability, a postsynthetic exchange
(PSE) approach was utilized to introduce paramagnetic manganese(II)
ions into ZIF-8;33 nanosized manganese-doped
zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (denoted as Mn–Zn–ZIF)
were thus fabricated. After doping manganese(II) ions into the matrix,
Mn–Zn–ZIF still maintains the original pH-responsiveness
and exhibits T1-weighted MRI contrast effect. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) results reveal Mn–Zn–ZIF still has huge surface
area for potential drug loading. Interestingly, we found the intrinsic
fluorescence optical imaging ability derived from 2-methylimidazolate.
As far as we know, it is the first time to report the intrinsic two-photon
fluorescence imaging of ZIFs. Therefore, manganese-doped zeolitic
imidazolate frameworks could act as intracellular two-photon fluorescence
imaging and pH-responsive T1-weighted MRI contrast agents simultaneously.

Results
and Discussion
Incorporating Mn2+ into ZIF-8 has
some difficulties
due to the structural instability of Mn2+–4N tetrahedral
geometry;34 our experiments revealed that
direct reaction of Mn2+ with 2-methylimidazole in different
solvents would result in the formation of complex molecules instead
of crystal structure. Satoshi Horike group had synthesized cubic [Mn(2-methylimidazolate)2] (denoted as Mn–ZIF) from [Mn(BH4)2·3THF]·NaBH4 under an Ar atmosphere.34 However, highly unstable structure of Mn–ZIF
hindered its further application. Recently, Cohen group reported postsynthetic
metal ion and ligand exchange in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks,33 which inspired us to introduce Mn ions into
the framework for further biomedical application. ZIF-8 was utilized
as the precursor and PSE approach was carried out according to the
report33 with a modified procedure; after
incubation with Mn(acac)2 at 60 °C for 2 days, the
nanoparticles (NPs) become brown (as illustrated in Figure S2). To get rid of unreacted Mn(acac)2,
another several days incubation in pure methanol was carried out,
and then Mn–Zn–ZIF was coated by a thin polydopamine
(PDA) layer for further PEGylation (denoted as Mn–Zn–ZIF–PEG)
to enhance biocompatibility and hydrophilicity of the NPs. As shown
in Figure 1: the overall
morphology of Mn–Zn–ZIF changed little compared with
the precursor (Figure S1). The dynamic
light scattering revealed that the mean diameter of the NPs was about
200 nm (Figure S3), which is suitable for
biological applications;18 a thin layer
on the surface of the nanoparticles could be observed after PDA coating
and PEGylation (Figure S5). Dark-field
scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and electron energy
loss spectroscopy (EELS) mapping of one nanoparticle clearly show
the spatial distribution of Zn, Mn, N, C, and O elements in the nanoparticle.
Obviously, Zn, N, C, and O elements are uniformly distributed and
match fairly well with the NP, whereas Mn element displayed inhomogeneous
distribution with less amounts existing in the inner core, which revealed
the substitution by manganese(II) mainly happening in the exteriors
of the NPs.

SEM image and (d) TEM image of Mn–Zn–ZIF–PEG
nanoparticles. (e) Dark-field STEM images and EELS elements mapping

Zn, C, N, and O elements.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the as-prepared nanoparticles
are shown in Figure S4; the peak position
of Mn–Zn–ZIF has a good consistency with the standard
XRD pattern of ZIF-8, which could verify that the highly porous SOD
topology as well as the crystallinity of ZIF-8 was retained after
postsynthetic exchange;33 however, a slight
left shift was observed in Mn–Zn–ZIF, as illustrated
in Figure 2a, which
could verify the successful doping of Mn ions. Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements of Mn(acac)2, ZIF-8, Mn–Zn–ZIF,
and Mn–Zn–ZIF–PEG were carried out; as illustrated
in Figure 2c, strong
characteristic peak of pure Mn(acac)2 such as wavelength
at 1557 cm–1 was not observed in Mn–Zn–ZIF
and Mn–Zn–ZIF–PEG, demonstrating the brown color
of the NPs should not simply result from the adsorption of Mn(acac)2 by ZIF-8 but doping of Mn ions. The characteristic band of
Mn–Zn–ZIF and Mn–Zn–ZIF–PEG at
421 cm–1 (Zn–N stretching mode35) weakened compared with that of ZIF-8, which
could further prove the doping of Mn ions from the side aspect. The
appearance of an characteristic band at 1103 cm–1 (C–O–C ether stretch band36) of Mn–Zn–ZIF–PEG was attributed to CH2–O–CH2 group in PEG, revealing the
successful PEGylation of Mn–Zn–ZIF. The molar ratio
of Mn to Zn was measured to be approximately 1:5.56 ± 0.45 by
inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES),
indicating around 15% of Zn ions were replaced by Mn ions; as described
above, the instability of Mn2+–4N cores restricted
the further exchange amount. The presence of Mn in ZIF-8 was also
confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements with
the peak at 641.27 eV in spectra. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area of Mn–Zn–ZIF NPs was measured to
be 1951.01 m2 g–1 with pore size around
1.076 nm, revealing the high specific surface areas and microporosity
of Mn–Zn–ZIF for potential drug loading. In conclusion,
the above results together with related literature33,34 convinced the successful fabrication of bimetallic zeolitic imidazolate
framework.

After incorporating Mn
ions into the matrix, the pH-responsive
dissolution property was also examined. Compared with original one,
the shape of NPs in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution (pH 5.5)
got destroyed, which could be approximately expressed as hollow distribution
as shown in Figure 3a,b. The structure was in accordance with the distribution of Mn
elements: the doping of manganese was mainly distributed in the exterior
of the NPs as shown in the elemental mapping, so it is reasonable
to deduce that the coordination between Mn and 2-methylimidazole would
be more solid than the coordination between Zn and 2-methylimidazole.
At pH 5.5, most of the coordination of Zn and 2-methylimidazole had
been destroyed, with quite a part of Mn–2-methylimidazole coordination
remaining, forming a hollow structure. The Mn release profile was
also measured in PBS solution under pH 5.5 and 7.4; in the first few
hours, Mn content had a burst release and gradually went steady and
finally 36% of Mn was released at pH 5.5, whereas at pH 7.4, the Mn
release had a much lower degradation percentage. The morphology change
and the release profile testify the NPs were still sensitive to mild
acidity and theoretically could respond to the acidic pH in endosomal/lysosomal
compartments of cells.18 The above results
demonstrated that Mn–Zn–ZIF still had decent pH responsiveness
after the incorporation, which render it great potentials as a drug
delivery carrier.

of Mn release content over time in PBS solution.

The NPs (ZIF-8, Mn–Zn–ZIF, and Mn–Zn–ZIF–PEG)
were incubated with 4T1 cell lines for 24 h without any further dyeing
in a concentration of 100 μg mL–1 for fluorescence
optical imaging tests by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM).
Irradiated by laser beams of 360 nm wavelengths of single-photon excitation
(λex = 360 nm), the cultured tumor cells emitted
blue fluorescence. Fluorescence spectra were examined to figure out
the origin of fluorescence, and the emission spectra of 2-methylimidazole,
ZIF-8, and Mn–Zn–ZIF were basically consistent with
each other upon excitation by 360 nm laser, as illustrated in Figure 4a. The emission peaks
were at around 425 nm, which were just located in the blue spectrum
region; therefore, we can reasonably infer that the blue fluorescence
by 360 nm single-photon excitation was derived from 2-methylimidazole
and the fluorescence might be attributed to the π*−π
transition of 2-methylimidazole according to some literature.37−39

incubated with 4T1 cells with different excitation wavelengths (360
nm single-photon excitation, 720 nm two-photon excitation, and bright-field

However, due to the drawbacks of UV-excited imaging such
as undesired
tissue photodamage, two-photon fluorescence (TPF) microscopy was thus
proposed. With the aids of powerful femtosecond pulse irradiation,
the nanoprobes can simultaneously absorb two photons to the excited
state and then emit fluorescence after a ground-state relaxation,
which is equivalent to half-wavelength excitation of single photon
in effect. Two-photon laser scanning microscopy has proved to be an
important instrument for directly observing cellular structure and
biological process with the superiority of larger penetration depth,
less photobleaching and photodamage, and improved resolution compared
with traditional confocal microscopy,40 and adequate absorption cross section of the nanoprobes was required
to realize two-photon absorption, so our probe was employed to examine
the TPF potentials. Upon biphotonic excitation at 720 nm, ZIF-8, Mn–Zn–ZIF,
and Mn–Zn–ZIF–PEG NPs all displayed outstanding
fluorescence in the blue spectrum region (Figures 4b,c and S8). Obviously,
from the images, fluorescence intensity under 720 nm two-photon excitation
was stronger than the one of 360 nm single-photon excitation. As far
as we know, it is the first time to report the intrinsic two-photon
fluorescence imaging of ZIFs. This two-photon fluorescence imaging
potentials of ZIFs provide the feasibility of long-term imaging of
cellular process with alleviatived photodamage compared to UV-exicited
imaging (Figure 5).

relaxation rates over Mn concentration
and T1-weighted MR images of (a) Mn–Zn–ZIF nanoparticles
and (b) Mn–Zn–ZIF–PEG nanoparticles immersed
in PBS solution (pH 7.4, 5.5) for 1 h.

MRI measurements were performed by a clinical 3T magnetic
resonance
scanner. Both Mn–Zn–ZIF and Mn–Zn–ZIF–PEG
were respectively dispersed in PBS solution (pH 7.4 and 5.5) with
different concentrations to determine the longitudinal (r1) relaxivities (Figure 5). The r1 value of Mn–Zn–ZIF
was 1.71 mM s–1 at pH 7.4, whereas the value rose
to 1.98 mM s–1 at pH 5.5. For Mn–Zn–ZIF–PEG
NPs, the agent exhibited r1 value of 2.17
mM s–1 at pH 7.4 and the value became 2.50 mM s–1 at pH 5.5. The reason for the contrast enhancement
at acidic environment was obvious: due to the pH-responsiveness, Mn
ions were released from the matrix with decomposition of the NPs,
which would enhance the positive contrast effect according to the
Solomon–Bloembergen–Morgan theory,41 and the value change could also prove the acid-sensitivity
of Mn–Zn–ZIF in turn. As for the enhancement of Mn–Zn–ZIF–PEG
compared to Mn–Zn–ZIF, a similar situation has occurred
before:42 The hydrophilicity of the NPs
was enhanced after a thin layer is coated, which contributes to T1
innersphere relaxivity. Although lower than FDA-approved T1 CA (gadolinium-diethylenetriamine
penta-acetic acid, r1 = 4–5 mM–1 s–1), the r1 value of our NPs showed comparable performance to many reported
T1 contrast agents.43−46 The results above indicated the feasibility of the NPs as a T1-weighted
contrast agent. Theoretically, the NPs would penetrate the tumor vasculature
due to the enhanced permeation and retention effect and accumulate
in solid tumors for long periods.47 The
above consequence demonstrated that the NPs offered a multiple-choice
platform for biological labels.

MTT assays were carried on 4T1
cell lines to evaluate the cytotoxicity
of the Mn–Zn–ZIF and Mn–Zn–ZIF–PEG
nanoparticles, Different concentration levels ranging from 12.5 to
75 μg mL–1 were assessed. The MTT cell proliferation
assay results (Figure 6) demonstrated that Mn–Zn–ZIF nanoparticles showed
some toxicity, but the biocompatibility was well enhanced after PEGylation.
Obviously, PDA shell and PEGylation not only bring a better MR imaging
effect but also make the NPs more biologically biocompatible, and
the release of relatively toxic Mn ions could be reduced due to the
PDA coordination.48 MTT assays show that
the sample after decoration has potentials for further in vivo application.

Conclusions
In summary, manganese-doped zeolitic imidazolate
framework was
prepared and further PEGylated for the bioimaging application. As
expected, Mn–Zn–ZIF and Mn–Zn–ZIF–PEG
displayed pH-responsive MR imaging ability; and intrinsic fluorescence
of ZIFs can provide the possibility for two-photon fluorescence imaging.
The combined imaging modalities derived from the modification or intrinsic
property could compensate for the lack of imaging capability of ZIF-8,
extending the application of ZIFs to a diagnostic platform. On the
other hand, the NPs after modification still preserve the original
characteristics of pH-responsiveness, microporosity, and high specific
surface areas, rendering it suitable for drug delivery. Although corresponding
therapy was not performed, it is reasonable to believe that manganese-doped
zeolitic imidazolate framework could serve as a theranostic platform
for future application, and further in vivo theranostic experiment
would be our next step.

Experimental Section
Materials
Poly(vinylpyrrolidone)
(K-30) and zinc nitrate
hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O,
99.0%) were purchased from Shanghai Chemical Reagent Company (Shanghai,
China); manganese(II) acetyllacetonate (96%) was purchased from Alfa
Aesar Company (Shanghai, China); 2-methylimidazole (H-MIM) was purchased
from J&K chemical Ltd. (Shanghai, China); dopamine hydrochloride
was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corporation (Shanghai, China); and
methoxy-PEG-N-hydroxysuccinimide (mPEG-NHS, MW: 5000)
was purchased from Sangon Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China).
All the above chemicals were used without further purification.

Method of Synthesis of Mn–Zn–ZIF
Typically,
ZIF-8 was prepared according to the previous report.49 Then, Mn-doped ZIF-8 was synthesized according to a literature,33 with a modified procedure: 0.9 g manganese acetyllacetonate
was dissolved in 30 mL methanol (MeOH), then 0.3 g ZIF-8 was dispersed
in the above solution, and the mixture was incubated at 60 °C
in a preheated oven for 48 h. The resulting precipitate (denoted as
Mn–Zn–ZIF) was centrifuged and washed several times
with MeOH until supernatant become colorless. Then, the nanoparticles
were soaked in methanol for 3 days at 60 °C, and the solution
was replaced with new MeOH (20 mL) every 24 h. After 3 days of soaking
procedure, the precipitate was centrifuged and dried in a vacuum oven.

Method of Synthesis of Mn–Zn–ZIF–PEG
To enhance the biocompatibility and hydrophilicity of Mn–Zn–ZIF,
PEGylation of Mn–Zn–ZIF was carried out. Before PEGylation,
a thin polydopamine (PDA) layer was coated for easily introducing
PEG: 30 mg Mn–Zn–ZIF was dispersed in 8 mL H2O and then 0.5 mg dopamine hydrochloride was added; due to the resulting
alkalinity from a small amount of 2-methylimidazole dissolution, no
Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris–HCl) was needed. After
stirring for 60 min, the precipitate was centrifuged and washed several
times with H2O. Then, the precipitate was redispersed in
8 mL H2O and then 20 mg mPEG-NHS was added. The solution
was stirred for 12 h and then centrifuged and washed several times
with H2O and dried in a vacuum oven.

Characterization
The morphology of the nanostructured
material was observed using a field emission scanning electron microscopy
(JEOL JSM-6700M) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, Hitachi
H7650). The crystal structure of the material was measured by an X-ray
diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku D/MAX-cA, Japan); 2θ scanning range
was 10–70°. Metal-ion concentrations were measured with
an Optima 7300DV inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer
(ICP-AES). The surface electronic structure was characterized by X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, VGESCALAB MKII). High-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (STEM, JEM2100F) was used to characterize
the distribution of Mn, Zn, O, C, and N elements in the sample. A
Magna-IR 750 spectrometer was utilized to obtain the FTIR spectrum
in the range of 500–4000 cm–1. Specific surface
areas were obtained according to N2 physisorption results
at 77 K (Micromeritics ASAP 2020) by the Brunauer–Emmet–Teller
(BET) equation, and density functional theory (DFT) formula was applied
to the adsorption branch to acquire the pore size distribution.

Mn Release Measurements
To record the Mn release profile
over time, 1 mg Mn–Zn–ZIF was dispersed in PBS solution
(pH 5.5 and pH 7.4) and centrifuged at specific time (6, 12, 24, and
48 h) at the speed of 11 000 rpm for 5 min; then, Mn concentrations
of the supernatants were characterized by ICP-AES. Three sets of experiments
were conducted in every group to get standard error bars.

In Vitro MRI
Measurements
Based on the Mn content of
Mn–Zn–ZIF and Mn–Zn–ZIF–PEG measured
by ICP-AES, different concentrations of Mn–Zn–ZIF and
Mn–Zn–ZIF–PEG were dispersed in the PBS solution
(pH 5.5 and 7.4) and clinical magnetic resonance scanner (GE Signa
HDxt 3.0 Tesla MRI system) was applied to measure the relaxation characteristics.
The T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging images were acquired by
utilizing a saturated recovery spin echo sequence (TE = 10 ms, TR
= 4000, 2000, 1000, 500, 200, and 100 ms).

In Vitro Fluorescence Microscopy
Measurement
The ZIF-8,
Mn–Zn–ZIF, and Mn–Zn–ZIF–PEG nanoparticles
were cultured with 4T1 cells for 24 h, followed by in vitro laser
confocal scanning fluorescence measurements. The detailed procedure
can be found in the previous literature22 and then incubation images were taken with a laser scanning microscope
(Zeiss L SM 710) equipped with a 63_1.3 numerical aperture PlanApo
objective.

In Vitro Cellular Toxicity Test
Cytotoxicity of the
NPs and the PEGylated ones were determined by the tetrazolium dye
(MTT) method using 4T1 cell lines. The cells were incubated in a 96-well
plate at 37 °C in a moist atmosphere with 100% CO2 and then the above medium was modified with fetal bovine serum (10%),
penicillin (100 units per mL), and streptomycin (100 unit). After
culture for 24 h, the solution containing Mn–Zn–ZIF
and Mn–Zn–ZIF–PEG nanoparticles were added to
replace the original medium. Then, MTT solution was added into each
well for another 4 h incubation. Finally, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay reader was applied to test the absorbance of each well.
