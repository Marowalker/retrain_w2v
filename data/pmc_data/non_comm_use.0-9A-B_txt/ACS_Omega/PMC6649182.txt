Six ionic liquids
(ILs) were selected based on their chemical and
physical properties to study the solubility of cyclosporine A. Of
these, cyclosporine exhibited higher room temperature solubility in
1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([C2mim][OAc]) than
in acetone, an effective molecular solvent used to solubilize and
purify cyclosporine. The solubility of cyclosporine in the ILs dramatically
increased at higher temperatures, a critical factor that cannot be
varied in a wide range with low boiling molecular solvents. The differences
in solubility were explored for cyclosporine purification. Cyclosporine
was purified up to ∼93% with n-butylammonium
acetate ([C4NH3][OAc]) and could be further
purified to 95% using an IL/organic solvent biphasic system. After
purification, cyclosporine was recovered as an amorphous solid using
the ILs.

==== Body
Introduction
Cyclosporine A (hereafter
cyclosporine) is a neutral, lipophilic,
cyclic endecapeptide with a molecular weight of 1202.635 g/mol and
low aqueous solubility (Figure 1). It is widely used as an immunosuppressive agent to prevent
rejection in organ and tissue transplantation during surgery by reducing
the activity of the patient’s immune system.1−3 Cyclosporine
is generally isolated as a complex in a nutrient medium by the cultivation
of the strain of Tolypocladium inflatum fungus species.4 In comparison with cyclosporine
B and cyclosporine C, the production of higher concentrations of cyclosporine
depends on the type of the selected fungus.

cyclosporine.

The development of strategies
to solubilize poorly water-soluble
active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) has been of great interest
in order to facilitate their purification and establish better drug
delivery systems.5−7 In this case, the solubility of the hydrophobic,
non-ionizable cyclosporine is determined by its crystallinity and
its interactions with the solvent. The structural conformation of
this drug depends on the solvent, which in turn affects its solubility;
when in an apolar environment, intramolecular hydrogen bonds stabilize
the β-sheet structure, while the addition of polar solvents
exposes its hydrogen bonding groups and breaks such 3D structures.8,9 These conformational changes are reflected in the differences in
solubility. Cyclosporine is soluble in methylene chloride (10 mg/mL—clear,
colorless to faint yellow solution), >100 mg/g in ethanol, methanol,
acetone, ether, acetonitrile, or chloroform; while it is slightly
soluble in water (0.04 mg/g) and saturated hydrocarbons (solubility
in hexane: 5.5 mg/g).8 Interestingly, its
solubility in water decreases with temperature (from 101.5 to 7.3
μg/L at 5 and 37 °C, respectively10), mainly due to dehydration of amino acid residues, affecting the
conformation and solubility of the drug.9

Several attempts have been made toward the isolation and purification
of cyclosporine. In an earlier report, cyclosporine was extracted
from a biomass broth (after inactivating the enzymes) by incubating
overnight with methanol in the first step, then further extracting
with ethyl acetate (EtOAc) in the second step, and finally the residue
from the second step was purified chromatographically in two stages:
(1) silica gel column (mobile phase: hexane/chloroform/methanol; 10:9:1)
and (2) resin column (mobile phase: methanol).11 Other reports purified cyclosporine through crystallization
with PEG-400 by slow temperature reduction combined with seeding.12,13 Cyclosporine can also be purified by two-stage continuous mixed-suspension,
mixed-product removal, and cooling crystallization with acetone.14,15 Still, a possible route to improvement in cyclosporine separation
is to enhance the solubility and purity of cyclosporine at room temperature.

An emerging research field of interest is the utilization of ionic
liquids (ILs, salts with melting points below 100 °C16) in pharmaceutical applications. ILs have been
exploited in the pharmaceutical industry, used in organic transformations,
either as catalysts and/or solvents,17−20 to turn solid drugs into liquids,
or as drug delivery systems,21 and even
to control the polymorphism of an API,22,23 to name a
few of their applications. ILs as potential pharmaceutical solvents
to dissolve poorly soluble APIs have been investigated for a range
of ILs and APIs.24,25

The goal of this work was
to evaluate the solubility of cyclosporine
in ILs and to develop strategies for purification at room temperature.
To accomplish this goal, we chose six different ILs based on their
chemical and physical properties to force interactions with cyclosporine
at the molecular level.

Results and Discussion
Cyclosporine
is a hydrophobic branched aliphatic connected via
amido linkages into a cyclic structure.26 We, therefore, chose ILs with varied lengths of alkyl chains bearing
functional groups with potential to form hydrogen bonding to (a) regulate
the hydrophobicity of the medium and (b) facilitate hydrogen bonding
with the amido moieties of the cyclosporine. The ILs chosen for study
include n-butylammonium acetate ([C4NH3][OAc]), n-octylammonium acetate ([C8NH3][OAc]), choline acetate ([Cho][OAc]), trihexyltetradecylphosphonium
chloride ([P66614]Cl), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate
([C2mim][OAc]), and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bistriflimide
([C2mim][NTf2]).

The crude cyclosporine
was obtained as an amorphous powder (Figure
S1, Supporting Information) with purity
of 90.8% and ca. 38 impurities as determined by high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) (Figure S7, Supporting Information). It decomposed at 336.3 °C as determined by TGA (Figure S2, Supporting Information). In order to investigate
cyclosporine’s solubility in the ILs chosen for their different
physical and chemical properties (Table 1), an attempt to prepare saturated solutions
was made as described in the Methods section.
Saturation was achieved for [C4NH3][OAc] and
[C2mim][NTf2] at 25 and 100 °C; however,
solutions of [P66614]Cl and [C2mim][OAc] became
too viscous to stir after reaching a certain concentration (Figure 2, right) and saturation
was not achieved. Also, due to the higher melting point of [C8NH3][OAc] (mp 48 °C27) and [Cho][OAc] (mp 80–85 °C28), these ILs were studied only at 100 °C. Each final solution
was filtered (hot if at elevated temperature) and a known amount of
the filtrate was dissolved in acetonitrile for HPLC analysis. The
cyclosporine concentrations are reported in Table 1.

Figure 2 Left: Cyclosporine solubility at 25 (gray) and
100 °C (black).
Right: Solutions of (a) 24.8 wt % cyclosporine in [C2mim][OAc]
after stirring at 25 °C and (b) 60.2 wt % cyclosporine in [P66614]Cl after stirring at 100 °C.

Solubilities

“wt %”; values in parenthesis represent mmol/L.

b Solubility at 53 °C.

c These are partial solubilities,
as these solutions became too viscous to stir at higher concentrations
(Figure 2, right).

d NA: not applicable; these ILs
have
melting points above 25 °C.

The solubility results (Table 1, Figure 2, left) indicate that, at 25 °C, cyclosporine was most soluble
in [C2mim][OAc] where it reached 24.8 wt % before the solution
became too viscous to stir. This is remarkably high in comparison
with the rest of the evaluated ILs and similar to its solubility in
acetone (20.3 wt %), a well-known molecular solvent for the drug.12,13 The overall trend in solubility at 25 °C followed the order
[C2mim][OAc] ≈ acetone > [C4NH3][OAc] (12.3 wt %) > [P66614]Cl (5.2 wt %) >
[C2mim][NTf2] (<0.1 wt %). When the molar
solubility of
the drug per mol of IL/solvent is compared, the differences between
[C2mim][OAc] and the rest of ILs and acetone are even higher.
In this case, the order is [C2mim][OAc] (46.5 mmol/mol
IL) > [P66614]Cl (25.3 mmol/mol IL) > [C4NH3][OAc] (15.5 mmol/mol IL) > acetone (12.3 mmol/mol
acetone)
> [C2mim][NTf2] (negligible).

At 100
°C, the solubilities of cyclosporine in all the ILs
increased dramatically. As a result of the lower viscosity as the
temperature was raised, more cyclosporine could be dissolved in [C2mim][OAc] (24.8–56.4 wt % or 46.5–183.4 mmol/mol
IL) before the viscosity became too high to continue. An even more
dramatic increase was observed for [P66614]Cl where the
amount which could be dissolved before viscosity became an issue jumped
from only 5.2 wt % at 25 °C to 60.2 wt % at 100 °C (23.5
vs 652.3 mmol/mol IL, respectively). A measurable amount of cyclosporine
(1.2 wt %, 3.9 mmol/mol IL) could be dissolved in the hydrophobic
[C2mim][NTf2] at this temperature, while the
solubility in [Cho][OAc] remained negligible (<0.1 wt %), and using
[C8NH3][OAc] the solubility was 25.7 wt % (54.3
mmol/mol IL). The low solubility in [Cho][OAc] can be related to its
poor hydrogen bond donor ability due to the strong interionic hydrogen
bond, resulting in low reactivity, also observed when used for biomass
dissolution.29 It is worth noting that
a reduction in cyclosporine solubility was observed with a longer
alkyl chain in the alkylammonium acetate ILs (67.1 vs 54.3 mmol/mol
IL for [C4NH3][OAc] and [C8NH3][OAc], respectively).

Using ILs allows performing studies
at high temperatures in comparison
to traditional solvents such as acetone, due to the low boiling points
of the latter. The solubility of cyclosporine in acetone at 53 °C
was reported to be ca. 30 wt % (20.7 mmol/mol acetone), a solubility
much lower than in [C2mim][OAc], [P66614]Cl,
or [C4NH3][OAc] at higher temperatures.

In some of our previous efforts to enhance the solubility of APIs,
we have demonstrated the influence on solubility of ibuprofen free
acid and lidocaine free base when excess parent amine or acid is present
in a protic IL.30 An increase in solubility
of ibuprofen (in its free acid form, insoluble in [C4NH3][OAc] or in acetic acid, HOAc) was observed in mixtures of
[C4NH3][OAc] and HOAc. Likewise, the solubility
of free lidocaine was increased in mixtures of [C4NH3][OAc] and n-butylamine (C4NH2), likely by weakening the strength of C4NH2 as a hydrogen bond donor.30

We therefore studied the solubility of cyclosporine in the protic
IL [C4NH3][OAc] in the presence of excess acid
(HOAc) or base (C4NH2). Solutions with 1:2,
1:1, and 1:0.5 molar ratios of IL/acid and IL/base were prepared by
direct addition. Following the same procedures noted in the Methods section, saturated solutions of cyclosporine
were prepared and analyzed at 25 °C. As shown in Figure 3, the solubility of cyclosporine
in [C4NH3][OAc] was improved with the addition
of either excess acid or base, where the addition of base had a pronouncing
effect compared to acid. This is in agreement with our observations
that cyclosporine solubilities were higher in the IL with the stronger
basic acetate anions, that is, [C2mim][OAc].

Figure 3 Cyclosporine

containing excess HOAc (IL/acid = 1:2, 1:1, and 1:0.5 molar ratios)
or C4NH2 (IL/base = 1:2, 1:1, and 1:0.5 molar
ratios) at 25 °C. *Partial solubility of cyclosporine, no more
cyclosporine was added to the solution after 45.5 wt %.

The results from the solubility studies were used
to assess the
usefulness of ILs in purifying cyclosporine from its impure form (here
called “crude cyclosporine, CC*”) with both antisolvent
and liquid–liquid extraction strategies. The antisolvent strategy
was explored using the water soluble ILs [C2mim][OAc],
[C4NH3][OAc], and the [C4NH3][OAc] systems with excess HOAc or C4NH2. The
usage of the latter systems (i.e., [C4NH3][OAc]
with excess HOAc or C4NH2) were previously reported
to induce crystallization of acidic and free base forms of APIs.19 EtOAc was studied for comparison.

Crude
cyclosporine (50 mg, 90.8% purity, see CC* in Figure 4) was added to a 15 mL glass
vial with 1 g of each IL, mixture, or solvent. The mixture was stirred
using a magnetic stir bar (350 rpm) for 1 h at room temperature (25
°C) for dissolution. Water (1 mL) was then added and the mixture
was vortexed to induce the precipitation of the cyclosporine. The
precipitates were filtered under vacuum and the filters were washed
with extra water to remove any remaining IL/solvent. The cyclosporine
was dissolved in acetonitrile and the percentages of cyclosporine
and the impurities dissolved in the solutions (Figure 4, Table S1) were
quantified using HPLC and calculated based on the peak areas, as noted
in the Methods section.

Figure 4 Crude cyclosporine (CC*)
purification using EtOAc, the ILs [C2mim][OAc] and [C4NH3][OAc], and mixtures
of [C4NH3][OAc] containing excess HOAc or C4NH2 (IL/acid or IL/base = 1:2, 1:1, and 1:0.5 molar
ratios). (Gray bar: cyclosporine; black bar: total impurities).

Although [C2mim][OAc]
had higher solubility of cyclosporine
than [C4NH3][OAc] at both 25 and 100 °C
(Table 1, Figure 2), the purity of
the recovered cyclosporine was much lower in the case of [C2mim][OAc] (72.9% pure) when compared to [C4NH3][OAc] (92.9% pure). The impurities observed when [C2mim][OAc]
was used were even higher than the starting CC*. This might suggest
that impurities were more soluble than the drug in [C2mim][OAc].
The addition of excess acid to [C4NH3][OAc]
did not improve the purity of cyclosporine, instead the purity was
observed to be 89.9% for two extra moles of acid per mole of IL. Excess
base did not have any significant effect on purity unless the amount
was increased to two extra moles. Overall, the high solubility of
the drug into the hydrophilic ILs and mixtures resulted also in higher
solubility of impurities, which are similar in structure to the drug.

Our next approach was to use liquid/liquid extraction rather than
antisolvent precipitation to obtain higher purity cyclosporine. Two
of the ILs with the high cyclosporine solubilities at 25 °C,
[C2mim][OAc] and [C4NH3][OAc], were
chosen for this study. To choose the best immiscible solvents to perform
the extraction, we considered the solubility of cyclosporine in chloroform,
toluene, dichloromethane, EtOAc, and ethyl ether which are all reported
to be >50 mg/mL,31 and in hexane which
is reported to be <5 mg/mL. Of these, [C4NH3][OAc] is immiscible with ethyl ether and hexane, while [C2mim][OAc] is immiscible with EtOAc and hexane, therefore these four
biphasic systems were examined.

Crude cyclosporine (CC*, 50
mg) was added into a 15 mL glass vial
containing 1 g of the two ILs and stirred at room temperature until
complete dissolution. The organic solvents were then added to these
solutions resulting in 1:1 weight ratios of the phases, sonicated
for 60 min, and finally allowed to stand 30 min for phase separation.
The upper, organic phases were separated, and a second portion of
organic solvent was added to the IL phase, repeating the extraction
step. All extracted volumes were combined and the solvent was allowed
to evaporate at room temperature. No solids were detected after solvent
evaporation of the organic phases (EtOAc, hexane) recovered from the
biphasic systems with [C2mim][OAc], indicating preferential
partitioning of the drug (and impurities) to the IL rather than the
organic solvent. On the other hand, solids were obtained after the
evaporation of the organic phases extracted from the systems [C4NH3][OAc]/organic solvents. All solids obtained
after evaporation were redissolved in acetonitrile and subjected to
HPLC analysis. The IL phases were dissolved in water to precipitate
any cyclosporine, which was then filtered and dried before dissolving
in acetonitrile for HPLC analysis (Table 2).

In the case of the [C4NH3][OAc]/ethyl ether
system, the cyclosporine purity reached 95% in the organic phase,
while its purity in the IL phase reached 91%. In the case of the [C4NH3][OAc]/hexane system, higher affinity of cyclosporine
was observed for the IL than the hexane phase (94.3 vs 70.3%, respectively),
possibly due to the low solubility of the drug in hexane. Independent
of the strategy or IL selected to purify the CC*, the recovered cyclosporine
remained in its amorphous form.

Conclusions
In
summary, we employed ILs as alternative solvents to dissolve
cyclosporine. At 25 °C among all ILs employed, [C2mim][OAc] had a higher solubility of cyclosporine than that of acetone,
a known molecular solvent for cyclosporine solubility. The solubility
can be enhanced more than 11X for [P66614]Cl and more than
2X for [C2mim][OAc] by increase of temperature from 25
to 100 °C. The ILs were also used to purify cyclosporine from
its crude form. The strategies evaluated allowed purification of an
amorphous cyclosporine up to ca. 95%. Although simple strategies such
as IL–organic solvents biphasic systems can be used to improve
the purity of cyclosporine, future work should focus on the crystallization
of the drug from highly concentrated IL solutions, if possible at
room temperature.

Methods
Chemicals
Crude
cyclosporine was supplied by Novartis-Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (USA) with purity of 90.8%. Purified cyclosporine
(95.0% purity, crystalline form), n-butylamine, n-octylamine, choline hydroxide, and glacial acetic acid
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Oakville, ON, Canada). Acetonitrile
(HPLC grade), ethyl ether, EtOAc, hexane, phosphoric acid, and tert-butyl methyl ether were purchased from Fisher Scientific
(Ottawa, ON, Canada). The water used in the experiments was obtained
from a Millipore purified water system (resistivity 18.2 MΩ
cm, 25 °C, Milli-Q Academic, Millipore, USA).

[Cho][OAc],
[C4NH3][OAc], and [C8NH3][OAc] were synthesized by following reported procedures (see Supporting Information for complete description
and characterization).32,33 [P66614]Cl was kindly
donated by Cytec-Solvay (Niagara Falls, ON, Canada). [C2mim][OAc] and [C2mim][NTf2] were purchased
from IoLiTec (Tuscaloosa, AL, USA).

Solubility Studies
Purified cyclosporine (0.05 g) was
added to a vial loaded with ca. 0.7 g of pure [C4NH3][OAc], [C8NH3][OAc], [Cho][OAc], [P66614]Cl, [C2mim][OAc], or [C2mim][NTf2] and the mixtures were stirred at 25 or 100 °C for 6
h. Also, mixtures containing 0.7 g [C4NH3][OAc]
with an excess of acetic acid or n-butylamine (0.33,
0.5, 1, or 2 molar excess) and 0.05 g of cyclosporine were prepared
in a glass vial and the solutions were stirred at 25 °C for 6
h. For all the solutions prepared above, if no solids were observed
after mixing, another 5 mg of cyclosporine was added to the solutions
and further stirred for 30 min. The addition of cyclosporine and stirring
steps were repeated until solid precipitation was observed after mixing.
The solutions were then filtered using a syringe filter (0.45 μm)
to separate the undissolved particles. The filtered homogeneous solution
was weighed and dissolved in acetonitrile in a 10 mg solution:1 mL
acetonitrile ratio for cyclosporine quantification using HPLC.

Purification
of Cyclosporine
Antisolvent Strategy
Crude cyclosporine
(50 mg) was
added to a 15 mL glass vial containing 1 g of [C4NH3][OAc], [C2mim][OAc], and [C4NH3][OAc] systems with excess HOAc, or C4NH2, or EtOAc. The mixtures were stirred at room temperature using a
magnetic stir bar (350 rpm) to complete dissolution (ca. 1 h). After
dissolution, 1 mL of water was added to precipitate the cyclosporine.
The precipitates were filtered under vacuum and the filters were washed
with extra water to remove any remaining IL/solvent. The precipitates
were redissolved in acetonitrile and analyzed using HPLC.

Liquid–Liquid
Extraction Strategy
Crude cyclosporine
(50 mg) was added to 15 mL glass vials containing a magnetic stir
bar and 1 g of [C4NH3][OAc] or [C2mim][OAc]. The mixtures were stirred at room temperature, 350 rpm
until complete dissolution (ca. 1 h). After dissolution, hexane or
EtOAc was added to cyclosporine in [C2mim][OAc] solution,
while hexane or ethyl ether was added to cyclosporine in [C4NH3][OAc] solutions, resulting in 1:1 (IL/organic solvent)
mass ratio biphasic systems. The mixtures were vortexed for 10 s,
sonicated in an ultrasonic bath for 60 min, and left on the bench
for 30 min until phase separation was completed. The upper, organic
phase was separated using a glass Pasteur pipet. A second portion
of organic solvent was added to the IL phase and the extraction and
separation steps were repeated. Both organic phases were mixed and
left on the bench for evaporation. If solids appeared, these were
dissolved in acetonitrile and analyzed using HPLC. The IL phase was
dissolved in water and the precipitated cyclosporine was filtered,
dried, and dissolved in acetonitrile for HPLC analysis.

HPLC Analysis
The IL-cyclosporine solutions produced
from the solubility studies and the powders recovered from the cyclosporine
purification experiments were dissolved in acetonitrile, filtered
through a 0.45 μm filter membrane, and injected into an Agilent
1260 series HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
The HPLC system was equipped with a quaternary pump, an autosampler,
and a multiwavelength UV–vis detector. HPLC separations were
carried out on a Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18 LC Column (250 mm × 4.6
mm, 5 μm, Agilent Technologies) at 75 °C. The flow rate
was 1.5 mL/min, and the injection volume was 20 μL. Following
a previously reported method,34,35 an isocratic elution
was selected, using a mobile phase of 52.1% acidified H2O (0.1% phosphoric acid), 43% acetonitrile, and 4.9% tert-butyl methyl ether, with a runtime of 80 min and a detection wavelength
at 210 nm.

Cyclosporine calibration curves were prepared for
quantitative analysis of cyclosporine dissolved and/or purified. A
stock solution of cyclosporine was obtained by dissolving ∼40
mg (purified cyclosporine, 95%) in 2 mL of acetonitrile. The standard
solutions were obtained by subsequent dilutions of stock solutions
with acetonitrile to obtain five different concentrations in the range
of 0.6–6 mg/mL. A linear calibration curve was obtained by
plotting the areas of the chromatogram peak against the concentration
to obtain R2 > 0.99 (Figure S6, Supporting Information). For purification studies,
impurities were treated as one “dummy” impurity, and
the purity of cyclosporine was calculated as in eq 1 1  where % area is the area under the chromatograph
peak observed by HPLC.
