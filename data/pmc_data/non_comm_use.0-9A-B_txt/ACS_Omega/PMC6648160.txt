Pretreatment
approaches are highly desirable to improve the commercial
viability of nanocellulose production. In this study, we propose a
new approach to mass produce nanocellulose using a hydrated choline
chloride/oxalic acid dihydrate deep eutectic solvent (DES) combined
with an ultrasonic process. The hydrogen bond acidity, polarizability,
and solvation effect reflected by the Kamlet–Taft solvatochromic
parameters did not decrease even after the addition of large amounts
of water. Instead, the water facilitated the ionization of H+ and delocalization of Cl– ions, forming new Cl–H2O ionic hydrogen and oxalate–H2O hydrogen
bonds, which are critical for improving the solvent characteristics.
One pass of kraft pulp through the hydrated DESs (80 °C, 1 h)
was sufficient to dissociate the kraft pulp into cellulose nanofibers
or cellulose nanocrystals using an 800 W ultrasonic treatment. The
present study represents an alternative route for the kraft pulp pretreatment
and the large-scale production of nanocellulose.

Introduction
Nanocellulose has attracted
widespread interest over the past decades.1,2 Owing
to the nanoscale dimensions, large specific surface area,
abundant reactive hydroxyl groups, and advantageous mechanical and
thermal properties, nanocellulose has been utilized to construct a
series of advanced materials/devices.3−6 Previous studies have confirmed that wood
and agrowastes are important sources of nanocellulose production.7−10 Nanocellulose with various structures and surface chemical properties
can be fabricated using various chemical and mechanical approaches.11−13

Nanocellulose is expected to be extracted in high yield with
few
steps and in an energy-efficient manner. However, the structural complexity
of the biomass components in cell walls often results in recalcitrance,
leading to the difficulty of individualizing the nanocellulose.14−16 Removing the matrix from the cellulose source is critical to reduce
the energy requirement and improve the degree of nanofibrillation.17,18 Some of the existing chemical reagents, such as acidified sodium
chlorite, carboxymethylated sulfite, hydrogen peroxide, and TEMPO,
have been used to pretreat the lignocellulosic biomass and readily
reduce the obstacles during mechanical processing.11,19−22 Despite the successful extraction of cellulose using these pretreatments,
some practice issues remain, such as the long treatment time and environmental
pollution. Among the new types of pretreatment protocols, organosolv
pulping and ionic liquid pretreatments have been recognized as effective
methods for fractionating lignocellulose components following the
concepts of green chemistry.22−25 Although several inexpensive formulations of these
solvents have been developed, they are still costly for industrial-scale
production of nanocellulose.

Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have
emerged as a new generation
of green solvents that fully agree with the 12 principles of green
chemistry.26 A DES is usually synthesized
by mixing a quaternary ammonium salt with a metal salt, a hydrated
salt, or a simple hydrogen-bond donor (such as an alcohol, amine,
or carboxylic acid).27 DESs are distinguished
by their ease of preparation, biodegradability, and environmental
friendliness.28 As DESs possess the unusual
characteristics of a wide liquid range, negligible vapor pressure,
high thermal stability, and nonflammability, they can be employed
in chemical reactions at near-ambient conditions and in a variety
of industrial applications.29 DESs have
been used to pretreat biomass efficiently compared to some traditional
solvents.30−32 Sirviö et al. reported that DESs can be used
as hydrolytic media for lignocellulose and pulp pretreatment to produce
cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) and cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs).33−37 In our previous studies, a choline chloride (ChCl)/oxalic acid DES
was applied to cleave the lignin–carbohydrate complexes in
wood and the strong hydrogen bonds in cotton to liquefy the noncellulosic
components and extract the cellulose fibers to produce CNFs and CNCs.38,39 The significance of such studies was to demonstrate the positive
role of DESs in providing a lignin-first biorefinery approach, while
simultaneously maintaining the cellulose available to produce nanocellulose.

Although DESs are promising green solvents, there remains major
challenges for using them to extensively produce nanocellulose. High
viscosity and high cost are the most obvious problems, which lead
to low mass concentration of dissolution and a slow solvent-transfer
operation.40 Diluting DESs with water is
an efficient way to decrease the viscosity and modify suitable DESs.41,42 A plausible reason is that water is a low-molecular-weight polar
solvent that acts as a third type of constituent in the DES system.
Using water also significantly reduces the viscosity and cost of a
DES system. To the best of our knowledge, no specific studies have
applied highly diluted DESs to refine kraft pulp and massively produce
nanocellulose. There is still little understanding of the relevant
mechanism.

Herein, hydrated DESs were synthesized to pretreat
kraft pulp.
The 10, 20, and 30% (v/v) DES solutions were prepared by mixing the
ChCl/oxalic acid dihydrate constituents with the corresponding amount
of water, respectively. A molecular dynamic simulation was employed
for an in-depth understanding of the dynamic interactions between
the DES constituents and water molecules and the supermolecular structures
that were formed. The Kamlet–Taft solvatochromic parameters
were measured to denote the solvent effects of the hydrated DESs.
The kraft pulp was pretreated with these hydrated DESs, and comprehensive
evaluations on the changes in chemical composition, degree of polymerization
(DP), and cellulose accessibility were investigated. The pretreated
pulp was fibrillated into CNFs and CNCs using ultrasonic treatment.
The morphology, surface functional group charges, crystallinity, and
physiochemical properties of the resulting CNFs and CNCs were comprehensively
studied.

Results and Discussion
Molecular Dynamic Simulation of the Hydrated
DESs
A
molecular dynamic simulation was employed to reveal how water interacts
with ChCl/oxalic acid DES at an atomic level and forms a co-solvent
system.44,45 In the radial distribution function (RDF)
graph of the hydrated DESs, the distance between Cl– and water molecules (Cl––H2O)
was the nearest, followed by that of oxalate–H2O
and Cl––H2O (Figures 1a and S3). The hydration number of Cl– was 6,
which was larger than those of other hydration interactions (oxalate–H2O, Ch+–H2O) (Figure S4). These observations reveal that the Cl––H2O anionic hydrogen bond plays a dominant role
in tuning the solvent properties. As neutral hydrogen bonds (oxalate–H2O) and ionic hydrogen bonds (Cl––H2O) coexisted, water presented higher hydrates of hydrogen
ions (typically H13O6+), which facilitated
the ionization and protonation of the co-solvent system. However,
the RDFs of the hydrogen interactions in 20% DES were similar to those
in DES (Figure 1b),
indicating that a modest amount of water participates in establishing
the hydrated hydrogen bonds rather than destroying the molecular interaction
system within the DES. As shown in Figure 1c, adding water to the ChCl/oxalic acid dihydrate
DES promoted the delocalization of molecules, and a great number of
internal Ch+ and oxalates were readily released, whose
accessible surface areas were enlarged. Accordingly, the fluidity
of the hydrated DES was notably enhanced. The viscosity of pure DES
and its hydrated DESs were studied through theoretical calculations
and experimental testing. The viscosity decreased significantly as
a large amount of water was added (Figure 1d). For example, after adding quadruple amount
of water to the DES, the viscosity of the resulting 20% DES decreased
from 62 to 1.8 mPa s, which is close to that of water. Such a low-viscosity
DES is suitable for pulp pretreatment. From this analysis, we deduced
that the “hydration factor” becomes another important
interaction in the co-solvent system (Figure 1e). The promotional effect of molecular water
can be regarded as the salvation-like effect and the water-mediated
H-transfer effect.46

Solvatochromic Parameters and NMR Spectra of the Hydrated DESs
The Kamlet–Taft solvatochromic parameters were used to estimate
the properties of the hydrated DESs. The parameters α, β,
and π* represent the hydrogen bond acidity, the hydrogen bond
basicity, and the polarizability of the solvents, respectively. The
α and β values of the ChCl/oxalic acid dihydrate DES were
1.90 and 0.41, respectively. The α value decreased slightly
to 1.75 after adding water to the DES (Figure 2a). No obvious differences were found among
the α values of the three hydrated DESs. The β values
decreased from 0.41 to 0.2 after adding water. The decrease in the
β values can be explained by Cl– being mostly
sequestered by anionic hydrogen bonds. The π* values describe
the ability to stabilize a neighboring charge or dipole, and it changed
little due to a stable hydration effect between water and the DES.

solvatochromic parameters of the hydrated
deep eutectic solvents (DESs). (b) 1H NMR spectra of pure
DES and the hydrated DESs.

The 1H NMR spectra of ChCl/oxalic acid dihydrate
DES
and the hydrated DESs are compared in Figure 2b. With the addition of water, the disappearance
of the peak at 7.2 ppm in pure DES indicates that the group of COO–H
in oxalic acid was delocalized, facilitating the ionization of H+. The resonance of peaks within 4.5–5.0 ppm originated
from the hydrated hydrogen ions. The shifting of the resonance to
a lower field was ascribed to the fact that water can diffuse faster
into the DES and interact with ChCl/oxalic acid molecules. From these
results, we confirmed that hydrated ions are important for improving
the solvent properties.

Kraft Pulp Pretreated with Hydrated DESs
Poplar wood
is comprised of 46.1% cellulose, 34.7% hemicellulose, and 19.1% lignin
as raw materials.38 The lignin content
of the bleached poplar kraft pulp from a sulfate pulping process dropped
from 19.1 to 3.8%, and the hemicellulose content declined to 13.8%
(Table 1). There was
3.8% lignin and 13.8% hemicellulose that remained in the kraft pulp.
The lignin and hemicellulose in the pretreated pulp were further reduced
after the kraft pulp was pretreated by one pass through the hydrated
DESs, and the cellulose content in the pretreated pulp reached 90%.
The DES treatment generated a hydrolytic influence on cellulose. The
DP values of cellulose decreased from 1452 in the kraft pulp to half
or one-third of that value (Table 1). The viscosity of cellulose also decreased significantly.
The hydrolytic influence on cellulose by the hydrated DES was much
less than that generated by 100% DES.

The hydrous DES can be reused to
pretreat the kraft pulp. The efficacy
of the hydrated DES can be maintained by supplying little of the DES
constituents, and the viscosity of the DES can be adjusted by adding
water. Furthermore, the DES can be recycled via distillation process.

Fabrication of Nanocellulose from Pretreated Pulp
Ultrasonication
is a frequently used approach in the liquid phase and in an open state.
Ultrasonic treatment does not need a complicated setup or a high equipment
investment. It is also suitable for industrial production. The drawback
is its weaker nanofibrillation efficiency on the cellulose than that
of other mechanical treatments, such as high-pressure homogenization.
The kraft pulp was hardly fibrillated into homogeneous nanocellulose
when directly subjected to an ultrasonic treatment (Figure S5). In conjunction with chemical pretreatments, the
ultrasonic treatment has been demonstrated to effectively disintegrate
the cellulose pulp into CNFs and CNCs.8,11,22,39 Here, the hydrated
DES pretreatment improved accessibility of the cellulose pulp and
facilitated the ultrasonic energy to disintegrate the pulp.47,48 The resulting nanocellulose suspensions appeared stable and showed
no obvious precipitates. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
images and size distributions of the nanocelluloses are shown in Figure 3. The 10% DES-pretreated
pulp produced CNFs after ultrasonic processing. The percentage of
the CNF diameters within 20 nm was 87%, and few recalcitrant thicker
nanofibers remained. The lengths were usually within 300–2000
nm,40 which were longer than those produced
from 100% DES-pretreated pulp (Figure S6).38,39 Increasing the DES concentration resulted
in CNCs with a narrower diameter distribution. Little change in the
diameter was observed between the CNCs pretreated with 20% DES and
that treated with 30% DES, but the CNCs pretreated with 30% DES were
shorter.

nanofibers (CNFs), (b) 20% DES-pretreated cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs),
and (c) 30% DES-pretreated CNCs.

The ζ-potentials of the CNFs and CNCs were all negative
at
approximately 17–20 mV (Figure 4a). Such values were close to those of short-time acid
hydrolysis but smaller than those of long-time acid hydrolysis.22,49 This result suggests that a slight DES-induced acidifying effect
occurred on the hydroxyls and generated charge repulsive forces. The
charge density of the resulting nanocellulose was determined by conductometric
titration. The carboxyl content was 0.05–0.12 mmol g–1, suggesting that the hydrated DES pretreatment led to the generation
of a small amount of negatively charged carboxyl moieties on the surfaces
of the nanocelluloses.50 The charge densities
obtained by this approach were far lower than those of the highly
carboxylated CNFs obtained from TEMPO and periodate-chlorite oxidation.51

suspensions/gels composed by (b) 10% deep eutectic solvent (DES)-pretreated
cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) and (c) 20% DES and (d) 30% DES-pretreated
cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs).

The dynamic rheological behaviors of the suspensions/gels
composed
by the DES-pretreated nanocelluloses (0.5 wt %) are shown in Figure 4b–d. Both
the storage modulus (G′) and the loss modulus
(G″) values were frequency sensitive at low
shear rates and became frequency independent as the shear rate continuously
improved. The dynamic rheological results agreed with the shear-thinning
behavior with a plateau region at the high shear rate interval. Although
the G′ and G″ values
were relatively low for the 10% DES-pretreated CNF suspension, they
represent a highly viscous fluid behavior (Figure 4b). The 20% DES-pretreated CNC suspension
showed the highest G′ values, which resulted
from the optimal pretreatment of the pulp and adequate nanofibrillation
(Figure 4c). Such a
suspension presents a gel-like behavior generated from the dynamic
stable network. The 30% DES-pretreated CNC suspension exhibited similar
rheological behaviors, but gel strength was far lower than those of
others, suggesting a low viscous fluid characteristic (Figure 4d).

Figure 5 shows the
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the CNF and CNC mats
produced by suction filtration and solvent evaporation drying. Although
the widths of the CNFs and CNCs were mostly within 20 nm, they self-aggregated
into long and thick nanofibers along the longitudinal direction during
the drying process, owing to the formation of hydrogen bonds between
the adjacent hydroxyl groups.52 The high-aspect-ratio
nanofibers also formed web-like entangled structures, and massive
nanometer-sized pores were observed throughout the entire mat.

Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the samples
(Figure 6a) reveal
the chemical
transformation of the components.53 The
disappearance of the absorbance peaks at 1590 and 1505 cm–1, representing the aromatic parts of lignin, was associated with
complete removal of lignin. The decrease in the intensity of the prominent
bands at 1732 and 1237 cm–1 (representing carboxyl
groups and attributed either to the acetyl and uronic ester groups
of the hemicellulose or to the ester linkage of the carboxyl groups
of lignin and/or hemicellulose) indicated the dissolution/removal
of hemicellulose. The stretching vibration characteristic peak of
the C=O groups at 1676 cm–1 was enhanced,
possibly corresponding to the presence of carboxyl and hemiacetal
groups.54

patterns, (c) thermogravimetric curves, and (d) differential thermogravimetric
curves of the kraft pulp and the hydrated deep eutectic solvent (DES)-pretreated
nanocelluloses.

X-ray diffraction (XRD)
was used to investigate the crystalline
structure and the relative crystallinity of the nanocelluloses (Figure 6b). The kraft pulp,
the hydrated DES-pretreated pulp, and the resulting nanocelluloses
all exhibited typical diffraction peaks at approximately 2θ
= 16.6 and 22.6°, which confirmed the type I crystal lattice
structure of the native cellulose.55 These
results reveal that the hydrated DES pretreatment did not change the
crystalline structure of the cellulose. The crystallinity index (CrI)
value of the kraft pulp was 65.88%, which increased to 69.08–70.01%
after pretreatment with hydrated DES. The increase in the CrI value
undoubtedly resulted from the removal of lignin and most of the hemicellulose.

The thermal degradation characteristics of the CNFs and CNCs were
compared with those of kraft pulp. Similar initial decomposition temperatures
of ∼280 °C were found among the resulting nanocelluloses,
whereas the temperature of maximum degradation of the 10% DES-pretreated
CNFs was slightly less than those of 20% DES-pretreated and 30% DES-pretreated
CNCs (Figure 6d). The
initial thermal degradation temperatures of the nanocelluloses obtained
by this approach were apparently higher than those of the CNFs produced
through the TEMPO treatment and those of the CNCs produced by strong
acid hydrolysis.

A pilot-scale test was conducted to produce
CNFs and CNCs under
optimized conditions. A portion of 0.5 kg (dry weight) pretreated
pulp to 100 L water was added to a pilot-scale circulating ultrasonic
apparatus (Figure 7a). The pilot-scale apparatus was equipped with three ultrasonic
generators. During the working process, the output power for each
ultrasonic generator was set to 800 W, and the processing time was
20 min. Therefore, approximately 100 L of CNF or CNC suspension (concentration:
0.5 wt %) can be processed by this apparatus every half hour. The
resulting suspensions were uniform and stable in the macroscopic view
(Figure 7c). However,
the CNFs (or CNCs) were a bit longer and thicker than those produced
on a laboratory scale (Figure 7d). The CNF/CNC diameters were almost within the range of
2–50 nm, and the lengths were usually larger than 500 nm.

Conclusions
In summary, green and low-cost hydrated
DESs were developed by
adding water to ChCl/oxalic acid dihydrate DES. The DES and the supermolecular
structure of water possessed features of hydrated ionic and neutral
hydrogen bonds, exhibiting high H+ ionization, ionic delocalization,
and polarizability. The hydrated DESs were effective for pretreating
kraft pulp to reduce pulp polymerization and increase its accessibility,
thus making it feasible to fabricate CNFs and CNCs though an ultrasonic
process. The 10% DES-pretreated pulp was nanofibrillated into CNFs
using an 800 W ultrasonic treatment for 20 min, and the 20% DES (or
30% DES)-pretreated pulp was disintegrated into CNCs using the same
ultrasonic treatment. The resulting CNFs and CNCs displayed a nano-order
scale, high crystallinity, and good thermal stability. The entire
pathway was simple and commercially competitive to produce nanocellulose
on an industrial scale.

Experimental Section
Materials
The
kraft pulp from poplar wood was used
as the raw cellulose material. ChCl and oxalic acid dihydrate were
purchased from Aladdin Reagent Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Copper(II)–ethylenediamine
complex (1 M, MW 121.6) for the DP test of cellulose was purchased
from Guangfu Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Tianjin, China).

Preparation
of Hydrated DESs
The ChCl/oxalic acid dihydrate
DES was synthesized at a molar ratio of 1:1 in a round-bottom flask.
The binary mixtures were reacted under reduced pressure at 80 °C
for 1 h until the mixtures became a clear liquid. Three hydrated DESs
were synthesized by mixing the DES with water at the volume concentrations
of 10, 20, and 30% and named 10% DES, 20% DES, and 30% DES, respectively.

Pulp Pretreatment with Hydrated DESs
The same amount
of kraft pulp was added to each hydrated DES and heated at 80 °C
for 1 h. The mass ratio of the kraft pulp to the hydrated DES was
5%. After the pretreatment, the pulp was filtered and washed with
deionized water. The yield was calculated as the weight percentage
of oven-dried pulp to that of raw kraft pulp.

Preparation of CNFs on
a Laboratory Scale
The pretreated
pulp was soaked in water at 0.5 wt % calculated content. The pulp
was nanofibrillated in a common ultrasonic generator (JY99-IIDN, Scientz
Biotechnology Co. Ltd., Ningbo, China) equipped with a cylindrical
titanium alloy probe (25 mm in diameter). The ultrasonic frequency
was 20 kHz, the output power was 800 W, and the processing time was
20 min.

Production of CNFs on a Pilot Scale
A 500 g portion
of pretreated pulp and 100 L of water were added to the 105 L reactor
chamber of a circulated ultrasonic apparatus (TGCXZ-100, Hongxianglong
Biotechnology Co. Ltd., Beijing, China). The pilot-scale apparatus
was equipped with three 25 mm cylindrical titanium alloy probes. The
ultrasonic frequency was set to 20 kHz, the output power was 800 W
for each ultrasonic generator, the mechanical stirring speed was 600
rpm, and the processing time was 20 min.

Characterizations
Molecular
Dynamic Simulation
The rectangular periodic
boxes contained 300 oxalate molecules and 300 ChCl molecules, and
the number of water molecules was adjusted from 8945 to 34 503
to achieve the required concentrations of 30% DES, 20% DES, and 10%
DES. The extended simple point charge model was used for the water
molecules, and the force-field parameters were obtained from the GROMOS54a7
for ChCl, oxalate, and water. The periodic boundary condition was
applied to all three dimensions. The particle mesh Ewald method was
used to calculate the long-range electrostatic interaction with a
real space cutoff of 1.0 nm. The short-range van der Waals cutoff
was set to 1.0 nm. Simulations were performed in the NVT and NPT ensembles,
with T = 353 K and P = 1 bar. Temperature
and pressure were controlled using a V-Rescale thermostat and Parrinello–Rahman
algorithm, respectively. The simulation temperatures were the same
as those used for the experimental conditions. Minimization was performed
using the steepest-descent algorithm for up to 50 000 steps
or until the convergence tolerance was reached. All of the simulations
were performed using the GROMACS 5.1 software suite. Radial distribution
functions, hydrated hydrogen bonds, accessible surface area, and viscosity
were computed using the GROMACS built-in analysis tools.

Viscosity
of the Hydrated DESs
The viscosity of each
sample was measured using a DVS+ digital viscosimeter (Brookfield
Co., Ltd., Stoughton, MA) and five repeated tests.

Kamlet–Taft
Solvatochromic Parameters of the Hydrated
DESs
Nile red was used as a solvatochromic indicator to determine
α, and 4-nitroaniline was used to determine β. N,N-Diethyl-4-nitroaniline was selected
to determine π*.43 See Note S1 and Figure S1 in the Supporting Information
for details.

NMR Analysis
A 300 μL aliquot
of dimethyl sulfoxide
and 300 μL DES sample were mixed together. The 1H
NMR spectra were recorded with an Agilent Pro Pulse 500 MHz spectrometer
(Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA) operating at 202.3 MHz
using an inverse gated decoupling sequence. Relaxation delay was set
to 5. Approximately 1000 transients were acquired to ensure a high
signal/noise ratio.

Chemical Composition Analysis
The
chemical compositions
of the kraft pulp and the hydrated DES-pretreated samples were determined
as described previously38 and expressed
as wt % content of lignin, hemicellulose, and cellulose. A minimum
of three tests were performed, and their average was calculated.

DP and Viscosity Measurement
The DP and viscosity of
the kraft pulp and the hydrated DES-pretreated samples were measured
using a 1835-4-0.80 Ubbelohde viscometer (Xinbiao Tengda Instruments,
Beijing, China) and copper(II)–ethylenediamine as the solvent.
See ISO 5351-2010 for details.

TEM Observation
TEM was used to observe the resulting
nanocelluloses under a FEI Tecnai G2 microscope (FEI, Best, the Netherlands)
at 80 kV. A 5 μL aliquot of the diluted slurry was dropped on
a carbon-coated electron microscopy grid and was negatively stained
with 1 wt % phosphotungstic acid to enhance the image contrast. The
sizes of the nanocelluloses were measured from the TEM images using
the TDY-V5.2 image analysis system (Tianhong Precision Instrument
Co. Ltd., Beijing, China).

Conductometric Titration
The charge
density of the
nanocelluloses was determined through the conductometric titration
with a DDS-11A conductivity meter (LEICI Instrument, Shanghai, China).
A 100 mg portion of the nanocellulose was suspended in 10 mL of 0.01
M HCl by 4 h of sonication. The suspension was titrated with 0.01
M NaOH. A titration graph was fit to determine the charge density
(Figure S2). The charge density was determined
as mmol of RCOO– per g nanocellulose from the volume
of NaOH used.

ζ-Potential Analysis
The surface
charge of the
aqueous nanocelluloses was measured using dynamic light scattering
with a zetasizer (Nano ZS, Malvern, U.K.).

Rheological Measurement
The rheological measurements
on the nanocellulose gels were carried out using a rotational rheometer
(AR 2000, TA Instruments, New Castle, DE). The strain amplitude value
was set to 0.25 to ensure dynamic oscillatory deformation within the
linear viscoelastic region.

SEM Observation
The microstructure of the nanocellulose
mats in a dry state was observed using a field emission scanning electron
microscope (Sirion 200, FEI) at 10–15 kV. The samples were
coated with platinum using a vacuum sputter coater before the observations.

FT-IR Spectroscopy
The FT-IR spectra were measured
using a Nicolet Magna 560 FT-IR instrument (Thermo Fisher Co., Waltham,
MA). The spectra were measured in the ATR mode, and the data were
recorded over the range from 650 to 4000 cm–1, with
a resolution of 4 cm–1.

XRD Analysis
The
XRD curves were obtained using an
X-ray diffractometer (D/max 2200, Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan) with Ni-filtered
Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) at 40 kV and 30 mA. The
diffraction data were collected from 2θ = 5 to 40° at a
scanning rate of 4° min–1. The crystallinity
index (CrI) was estimated using the Segal method.

Thermogravimetric
(TG) Analysis
The TG analysis was
performed using a TG analyzer (Pyris 6, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA)
at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 in a nitrogen
atmosphere.
