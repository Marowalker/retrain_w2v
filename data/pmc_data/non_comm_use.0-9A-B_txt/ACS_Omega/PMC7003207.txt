The development of self-healing rubbers is currently
under investigation
as a strategy to promote their reuse and, hence, reduce their waste.
However, autonomous, multicycle self-healing rubbers with good mechanical
properties have so far proven difficult to achieve. Here, mechanically
robust composites based on epoxidized natural rubber (ENR) and thermally
reduced graphene oxide (TRGO) were successfully designed and prepared
with a high healing efficiency of up to 85% at room temperature without
applying external stimuli. The incorporation of TRGO not only improves
the mechanical performance in more than 100% in relation to pristine
ENR but also promotes the hydrogen bonding interactions with the rubber.
This leads to a homogenous dispersion of TRGO within the ENR matrix,
which further increases its self-healing capability.

1 Introduction
In recent years, the inefficient
disposal and handling of polymer
waste is considered to be one of the most serious problems for the
environment, and in particular, elastomers are at a disadvantage compared
to thermoplastics because they cannot be easily reprocessed. Therefore,
the scientific community has made significant efforts to mitigate
rubber waste through the development of new ways of devulcanization1,2 or through their use as fillers in other systems.3,4 However,
rubber waste is still a pressing issue to be solved. An alternative
and actual strategy to overcome this limitation is by conferring self-healing
capability to elastomers, thus promoting their reuse.

Self-healing
is defined as the ability of a material to recover
or repair damage.5 It can be classified
as extrinsic and intrinsic. In extrinsic self-healing materials, a
healing agent is dispersed in the matrix and is released when some
type of damage occurs.6−8 These materials present the drawback of being limited
to a single cycle of self-healing.9 In
the case of intrinsic self-healing materials, recovery after damage
is achieved through supramolecular interactions, such as polar interactions
and hydrogen bonds,10−14 disulfide bonds,15−17 other bonds from reversible chemistry (like Diels–Alder18 and trans-esterification reactions19−21), metal–ligand and ionic interactions,22 shape memory,23 and combinations
between them.24,25 The disadvantages of these materials
are, to date, twofold: they need an external stimulus, such as pressure
or temperature, to activate these interactions9 and their mechanical properties are not optimal. Nonetheless, these
methodologies have resulted in the development of systems with high
self-healing efficiencies.

A strategy to improve the mechanical
properties of self-healing
elastomers is the inclusion of fillers. Cao et al.12 used tunicate cellulose nanocrystals (t-CNs) in epoxidized
natural rubber (ENR) compounds, achieving efficiencies of up to 85%
but requiring 20 parts per hundred parts of rubber (phr) of the filler.
Hernández Santana et al.17 developed
a styrene–butadiene rubber compound incorporating ground tire
waste, achieving a self-healing efficiency of up to 50%, due to the
exchange of disulfide bonds. Furthermore, they improved the mechanical
properties of the compounds by 80% with the incorporation of a coupling
agent without adversely affecting the self-healing efficiency. Li
et al.26 prepared a complex polymeric system
with self-healing capability, based on a polymer synthesized in situ
with furan and maleimide groups and graphene oxide functionalized
with furfurylamine and maleic acid. Such a system promoted crosslinking
by the Diels–Alder chemistry, enabling healing efficiencies
of up to 90%. The procedure, however, required a 110 °C temperature
and complex chemistry. Huang et al.23 designed
a thermoplastic elastomer based on ENR, polylactic acid, and ferrous
ferric oxide with a healing efficiency up to 70%, assisted by the
shape memory effect. The use of thermally reduced graphene oxide (TRGO)
has been pursued in different rubber matrices,26−30 particularly NR31 with
different self-healing protocols, including infrared light, electricity,
and electromagnetic wave. These studies proved that the addition of
TRGO improved the healing efficiencies to over 98% with just 5 wt
% of TRGO.30 In NR, TRGO reinforced the
matrix and achieved healing efficiencies for a tensile strength of
up to 62% with just 1.00 phr.31 However,
to the best knowledge of the authors, no publications were found related
to the self-healing capability of the ENR–TRGO system.

Currently, the research of elastomers with intrinsic self-healing
capability faces a great challenge: to achieve simultaneously (a)
autonomous self-healing, i.e., without any external stimuli and (b)
a positive balance between healing and mechanical performance, which
have been reported as antagonistic properties.32 Therefore, the purpose of this study was the development
of ENR reinforced with in-house synthesized TRGO with autonomous self-healing
capability. In the first stage, various compounds of ENR were prepared
with different contents of epoxy units and dicumyl peroxide (DCP)
to optimize the healing capability. This optimized system was later
used as a matrix in ENR–TRGO nanocomposites. The reason to
select TRGO was related to the presence on its surface of remaining
hydroxyl, carbonyl, and epoxy groups from its synthesis.33 These functional groups were aimed at both improving
the filler–matrix interactions and contributing to the self-healing
through the formation of hydrogen bonds.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Optimization of ENR Compounds with Self-Healing
Capability
The six ENR compounds for the first stage were
designed with different contents of epoxy units and three concentrations
of DCP, as shown in Table 1.

Table 1 ENR Compounds Expressed in phr
ingredient	F1	F2	F3	F4	F5	F6	
ENR 25	100	100	100	 	 	 	
ENR 50	 	 	 	100	100	100	
DCP	0.8	1.2	1.6	0.8	1.2	1.6	
In the second stage, ENR–TRGO nanocomposites
were designed
with three different contents of TRGO: 0.25 phr for FX-A; 0.50 phr
for FX-B, and 1.00 phr for FX-C, where “X”
denotes the number of the optimized compound in the first stage.

ENR can present different levels of epoxide groups randomly dispersed
along the isoprene backbone of the natural rubber. We selected two
levels of epoxidation, 25 and 50 mol %, ENR 25 and ENR 50, respectively,
and analyzed its self-healing capability. Supporting Information 1 shows the curing curves for the six ENR compounds.
In both elastomeric matrices, an increase in the maximum torque values
(MH) is observed with the increase of
the DCP content, well related to the increase in crosslink density
of the materials.

The curing parameters can be correlated with
the mechanical properties
by means of tensile tests, which are one of the most used characterization
techniques in elastomers. The stress–strain curves and parameters
of the ENR compounds are shown in Supporting Information 2. Accordingly, the values of modulus at low deformations (M100 and M300) increased
with the peroxide content because of the increase in crosslink density.34 Higher tensile strength was also observed in
ENR 25 systems as the DCP content increased. This result is consistent
with the trend in the maximum torque values and the crosslink density.
On the other hand, the presence of a higher content of cis-1,4 polyisoprene units of the NR (which crystallizes by deformation)
provides a remarkable reinforcing capacity.35 For the compounds with ENR 50, the tensile strength (σR) increased with the peroxide content and the elongation at
break (εR) tended to decrease. This behavior is also
associated with the higher crosslink density, which stiffens the material
and decreases its ability to deform.34

Figure 1 shows the
results of the tensile test after the self-healing protocol at 70
°C, as well as the efficiency of that protocol as a measure of
the retention of mechanical properties. The obtained results can be
linked to two variables: first, the content of epoxy units and second,
the peroxide content. A higher healing efficiency was observed for
ENR 50, with values of (53 ± 4)% in tensile strength and (56
± 2)% in elongation at break, which is attributed to the higher
concentration of epoxy units. On the other hand, the results show
a decrease in the self-healing efficiency with the increase of the
peroxide content, which is related to the increase in the crosslink
density. It is important to note that healing occurs if the polymer
chains have certain degree of mobility to diffuse. This mobility then
enables the restoration of the bonds and, hence, is impeded with high
crosslink density.32

Figure 1 Healing efficiency of
ENR compounds after applying a healing treatment
at 70 °C based on: (a) tensile strength; (b) elongation at break.

No results were found to compare directly these
results to those
of others using ENR as a matrix, due to many variables involved in
the self-healing process (epoxidation content, crosslink density,
time and cure temperature, curing system, and others). However, two
studies report the healing efficiency for unfilled ENR under different
conditions. According to Cao et al.,12 the
percentage retention of tensile strength in ENR 40 (with 40% of epoxidation
content) was 48% but with a lower amount of DCP, 0.5 phr. Additionally,
Nie et al.14 report a slightly lower efficiency
of 42% for tensile strength and just 12% for elongation at break.
Nevertheless, their composites were not vulcanized with any conventional
crosslink agent. These results reflect the importance of vulcanization
in the properties of rubber composites and the self-healing process.

There are two common reactions during the vulcanization of a diene
rubber with organic peroxides: (1) the abstraction of hydrogen adjacent
to the double bond to form the C–C bond, which generates the
crosslinked structure and (2) the rupture of the double bond and a
chain growth (a kind of polymerization). The ENR case involves a third
competing reaction: the ring-opening of epoxy groups that form hydroxyl
groups (−OH).36 These groups have
been suggested to create an effective thermoreversible crosslinked
supramolecular network in the ENR matrix.12,37 Thus, the higher concentration of epoxy units results in a higher
concentration of hydroxyl groups, which in turn increases the formation
of hydrogen bonds and thereby the self-healing capability. Scheme 1 presents the described
chemical route followed during the ring-opening reaction of the epoxy
group (at 160 °C) and the self-healing mechanism by the formation
of hydrogen bonds. Recently, this healing mechanism has also been
suggested in NR, where Sattar et al.38 combined
the effect of hydrogen bonds, within the NR proteins and lipids, with
metal–ion interactions and achieved healing efficiencies of
52% for the tensile strength at 50 °C in an unfilled compound.

Scheme 1 Proposed Scheme of Self-Healing Mechanism in ENR Compounds
The existence of these functionalities and hydrogen
bonds can be
observed by infrared spectroscopy in the attenuated total reflectance
(ATR) mode. Figure 2 shows the spectra of F1 and F4 (the spectra of all six ENR compounds
are presented in the Supporting Information 3). The peaks associated with the cis-1,4 polyisoprene
unit are identified at 2960, 2920, and 2860 cm–1 for the stretching vibration (str. vib.) of −CH, at 1660
cm–1 for the bending (bend. vib.) of C=C,
and at 1450, 1370, and 825 cm–1 for the bending
of CH2, CH3, and =CH, respectively. Regarding
the epoxy group, its characteristic peak is identified at 870 cm–1 that corresponds to the ring stretching vibration
and suggests that not all rings have been opened during vulcanization.
A small peak at 1730 cm–1 is also observed and is
associated with minor carboxylic groups derived from the epoxidation
reaction of the NR.12 The bands of the
hydroxyl groups are observed in the range between 3200 and 3500 cm–1.39 The different epoxy
content is clearly observed in the band at 870 cm–1 as increases its intensity in F4. Furthermore, the bands associated
with the cis-1,4 polyisoprene unit at 1660 and 825
cm–1 decrease and become broader and more diffuse.
Moreover, differences are also observed in the hydroxyl bands, which
intensify at 3480 cm–1 in ENR 50. This is associated
with the presence of intermolecular interactions, such as hydrogen
bonds and free hydroxyl groups. Another important change in the spectra
occurs in the bands that appear in the interval between 1110 and 900
cm–1, associated with the products derived from
the opening of the epoxy ring (other than hydroxyl), mainly of the
C–O–C (str. vib.) type.36,39

Figure 2 ATR spectra
of F1 and F4 compounds: (a) general spectrum, (b) magnification
in the hydroxyl groups band.

To optimize the healing conditions, the temperature
was reduced
from 70 °C to room temperature. The results obtained are summarized
in Figure 3. No significant
variation on the self-healing capability was observed. For ENR 25,
no changes in the healing efficiency were detected; while for ENR
50, the values at 70 °C were slightly higher with a variation
of less than 10%. Hence, F4 (ENR 50) healed at 25 °C was selected
as the optimal compound and healing protocol.

efficiency at different temperatures.

2.2 Development of ENR–TRGO Nanocomposites
with Self-Healing Capability
The effect of the TRGO in the
curing process was analyzed as a function of the TRGO content. The Supporting Information 1 shows the curing curves
of ENR–TRGO nanocomposites. An increase of MH was observed in the nanocomposites with TRGO compared
to the base compound (F4), which is ascribed to the reinforcing capacity
of the filler.40 Additionally, MH increases with the loading content of TRGO
up to 0.50 phr and subsequently stabilizes. This trend could be attributed
to possible agglomerations at 1 phr of TRGO, which would hinder the
reinforcing capacity of the TRGO. Other studies have reported this
fact at similar concentrations.41−44

In filled elastomers, the crosslink density
determined by the equilibrium swelling method is considered as an
indirect measurement of the filler–rubber interactions. There
is an increase in the crosslink density, consistent with the MH value, except in F4-C that decreases, which
could be a consequence of the agglomerate formation. Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images also suggest the presence of such agglomerates
in this sample (Figure 4), where large lamellar structures are observed at high magnifications.

Figure 4 SEM photomicrographs
of the ENR–TRGO nanocomposites: (a)
F4—250×, (b) F4-B—250×, (c) F4-C—250×,
and (d) F4-C—500×.

The study of the interactions in the ENR–TRGO
nanocomposites
was completed with the determination of the viscoelastic properties,
via dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and the so-called Payne Effect.
According to Payne,45,46 there are four contributions
to the reinforcement of a filled elastomer: the first derived from
its crosslink density; the second, the hydrodynamic effect of the
filler; the third, the rubber–filler interactions; and, finally,
the filler–filler interactions. The first three are independent
of the deformation, whereas the last one is not. This dependence is
quantified through the reduction of the storage modulus (E′) when applying a deformation. When the weak interactions
between the fillers are broken, portions of the elastomer trapped
between these filler particles are released, increasing mobility and
resulting in a decrease of E′. The quantification
of this effect is then used to confirm the formation of agglomerates
(filler–filler interactions) in a nanocomposite.47−49Figure 5 shows the
results by DMA. The increase in the E′ plateau
at low deformations is associated with an increase in stiffness through
the incorporation of TRGO; however, compound F4-C deviates from this
trend, which is associated with lower interactions with the matrix
and greater filler–filler interactions (agglomerates), which
is also corroborated by the earlier start of the E′ drop.

Figure 5 Study of the Payne effect by DMA.

Finally, the characterization of the mechanical
properties of the
nanocomposites was carried out. The Supporting Information 4 summarizes the parameters derived from the stress–strain
curves of the ENR–TRGO compounds. The stress at low deformations
(M100 and M300) increases as a function of the TRGO content due to the rise of
hardness generated by the presence of a rigid solid in the soft matrix.
Tensile strength also increases linearly with the nanofiller content,
as a result of the good interaction between TRGO and the ENR matrix,
reaching a maximum in the compound with better dispersion, F4-B.

Figure 6 shows the
results of the tensile test of the ENR–TRGO nanocomposites
after applying the self-healing protocol at 25 °C, as well as
the healing efficiency as a measure of the recovery of the mechanical
properties. For comparative purposes, the results of F4 previously
presented are also included. TRGO increases the healing capability
as a function of loading fraction, except for F4-C. Such a decrease
in healing efficiency is ascribed to the formation of agglomerates.
F4-B exhibits the greatest healing efficiency, with (82 ± 3)%
in tensile strength and (86 ± 3)% in elongation at break. Supporting Information 5 shows the stress–strain
curves of F4-B before and after healing protocol. Chen and co-workers
have reported similar healing efficiencies using ENR 40 and different
bio-based fillers.12,14,21,37 Their results showed efficiencies of, on
average, 85% for the tensile strength but required high loading fractions,
20 wt %, to achieve it and to obtain decent mechanical properties.
In our investigation, we have achieved comparable mechanical reinforcement
and self-healing efficiency to those systems reported in the literature
but with an important decrease in the filler content. This substantial
improvement could be a consequence of the good compatibility of TRGO
with ENR and the higher formation of hydrogen bonds at room temperature. Scheme 2 shows the proposed
reactions that could be occurring during the vulcanization and the
self-healing mechanism.

(a) tensile strength; (b) elongation at break.

Scheme 2 Proposed Scheme of Self-Healing Mechanism in ENR–TRGO
Nanocomposites
As mentioned above, the epoxy ring opens during
the vulcanization
and forms two radicals. The radical associated with the oxygen atom
usually becomes a hydroxyl group, while the carbon radical of the
main chain pairs with some derivative of the decomposition units of
the vulcanization agent or with the radical of another chain, as shown
in Scheme 1. The incorporation
of TRGO results in the formation of hydrogen bonds between its functional
groups and the radicals derived from the rupture of the epoxy ring.
To verify this fact, the ATR study of the nanocomposites was carried
out, as shown in Figure 7. In the zone of the triplet, at 1100 cm–1, the
variations derived from the rupture of the epoxy ring are observed,
being this change evident for F4-B. This could be associated with
the formation of C–O–C structures that contribute to
the reinforcement.39 This fact is corroborated
with the decrease of the intensity of the peak at 870 cm–1 and with the increase of the hydroxyl group band that also shifts
to 3350 cm–1. This displacement can be associated
with the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds that can be sacrificial
at room temperature and contribute directly to the self-healing capability.
The shift to higher wavenumbers of the hydroxyl bands was observed
by She et al.40 and was also ascribed to
the formation of hydrogen bonds between the ENR and oxygenated groups
in the TRGO sheets. On the other hand, changes in the range between
840 and 800 cm–1 would be associated with the addition
of TRGO.39

Figure 7 ATR spectra of the ENR–TRGO nanocomposites.

The self-healing capability was also followed at
the microscopic
level by optical profilometry. A scratch was made on the surface of
the samples, and the same self-healing protocol was applied. Figure 8 shows the scratch
profiles of F3 (sample with the lower self-healing efficiency at macroscopic
level), F4 (base compound), and F4-B (sample with the higher self-healing
efficiency at macroscopic level), before and after the healing protocol.
The area between profiles is understood as the portion recovered,
which will have a viscoelastic contribution (associated with the ENR)
and another to the self-healing. In this way, the healing efficiency
can be estimated from the relationship between the areas.9 According to Vega et al.,50 this technique provides one of the most suitable parameters
to quantify the self-healing efficiency with a low experimental error.
The results show comparable values to those achieved by the recovery
of tensile properties (4% for F3, 68% for F4 and 88% for F4-B), confirming
the healing capability. Furthermore, our results confirm the observation
of Tanasi et al.18 who proposed that the
healing process starts from the bottom up.

protocol.

3 Conclusions
ENR–TRGO composites
with a high healing efficiency of up
to 85% at room temperature were successfully prepared. Healing is
achieved through the existence of hydrogen bonds and a supramolecular
network. In addition, the incorporation of only 0.5 phr of TRGO improves
the mechanical properties in more than 100% in relation to pristine
ENR.

In summary, we demonstrate a conceptual framework to improve,
simultaneously,
the overall mechanical performance and healing ability of rubber nanocomposites,
without applying an external stimulus and at room temperature. These
results open the path to the development of other elastomeric materials
in which the inclusion of nanofillers in small amounts appears as
a good alternative to overcome the trade-off between mechanical/structural
performance and healing ability.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Two grades of ENR were
used with 25 and 50% of epoxy units (EKOPRENA 25 and EKOPRENA 50,
respectively). Figure 9 shows the chemical structure of ENR, and Table 2 summarizes their technical specifications.
The vulcanization system, bis(1-phenyl-1-methylethyl)peroxide (C18H22O2), also known as DCP, was obtained
from Merck KGaA.

Graphite powder (G), with a particle size of less
than 20 μm,
from Merck KGaA, was used to synthesize TRGO. Fuming nitric acid (HNO3), 100% extra pure, and 99% potassium chlorate (KClO3), reactive grade, were purchased from Merck KGaA and Acros Organics,
respectively.

4.2 Synthesis and Characterization of TRGO
The synthesis of graphite oxide was carried out using the Brödie’s
method, followed by the exfoliation and thermal reduction under inert
atmospheres at 1000 °C. Briefly, the fuming nitric acid was cooled
to 0 °C in a cryostat bath, and then the graphite powder was
added. Next, the potassium chlorate was slowly added, and the reaction
mixture was stirred for 21 h at 0 °C. Finally, the mixture was
diluted in distilled water and brought to neutral pH. After the thermal
exfoliation and reduction, the obtained TRGO was stored in an airtight
container. A detailed account of the reaction procedure can be found
elsewhere.33,51Supporting Information 6 presents the characterization of the synthesized
TRGO.

4.3 Preparation of ENR Compounds
The
mixing was carried out in a two-roll mixer Comerio Ercole S. P. A.,
of 15 cm in diameter, 30 cm in length and friction ratio between rolls
of 1:1.5 for 20 min. The equipment was maintained with a constant
cooling system to avoid excessive heating during mixing and to prevent
scorch. The rubber was passed through the rollers for mastication
for 10 min. Then, DCP was added and transversal cuts were made to
the band to promote the homogenization and good distribution of the
additives. The final bands were stored in a refrigerator, at least
72 h before use. Mixing of the nanocomposites was also done in the
two-roll mixer. The same procedure described was followed, incorporating
the TRGO 8 min after initiating the mixing.

The vulcanization
of the compounds was carried out in a hydraulic press Gumix, at 160
°C and a pressure of 200 bar. Five degasses were made to avoid
the formation of bubbles, and subsequently, the test pieces were cut
with the necessary dimensions for the different experimental techniques.

4.4 Characterization of the ENR Compounds
4.4.1 Rheometric Properties
An oscillating
disc rheometer from Alpha Technologies, model RPA 2000, was used for
the rheological characterization of the prepared compounds. The samples
were placed between polyester films on an oscillating disc with 1°
amplitude at 160 °C for 120 min. The equipment recorded the torque
generated by applying a shear deformation as a function of time, yielding
the curing curves of the compounds, from which the curing time was
obtained at 90% of the maximum torque (t90).

4.4.2 Crosslink Density
Swelling measurements
were performed on five squared samples, of 20 mm side and 2 mm thickness,
for each compound. Once their mass in air was measured, they were
introduced in a toluene bath, with enough separation and avoiding
friction with the bottom of the container to minimize physical barriers
that hinder diffusion. After 72 h, samples were weighted after extraction
and after evaporation of the solvent until it reached a constant value
at room temperature. The crosslink density (ν) was estimated
by the Flory–Rehner relationship,52,53 according to eq 1 1  where Vo is the
molar volume of toluene (106.20 cm3/mol), μ is the
Flory–Huggins interaction parameter between the rubber and
toluene (0.42), and VR is the volume fraction
of rubber, estimated according to eq 2 2  where m1 is mass
in air, m2 is mass after extraction of
the solvent, m3 is mass after evaporation
of the solvent, D is the density of the formulation, DS is the density of the toluene (0.87 g/cm3), and VF is the volume fraction
of the TRGO.

4.4.3 Scanning Electron Microscopy
The
TRGO dispersion in the ENR matrix was observed by means of an environmental
SEM, Phillips, model XL30 with a tungsten filament with an acceleration
voltage of 25 kV, after sputter-coating with gold. The analysis was
made on the surface derived from the cryogenic fracture of a sample
of each compound of interest.

4.4.4 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
The changes in the functional groups produced during the vulcanization
of the nanocomposites were studied by infrared spectroscopy in the
ATR mode using a PerkinElmer spectrometer, model UATR Two from 400
to 4000 cm–1, with a resolution of 4 cm–1.

4.4.5 Mechanical Properties
The determination
of the mechanical properties was carried out in an Instron universal
testing machine, model 3366, at room temperature. At least five dog-bone
shape samples (type III) were tested according to UNE-ISO 37:2013
standard, using a cross-head speed of 200 mm/min and a distance between
clamps of 35 mm. The tensile stress, also referred to as modulus,
at 100, 300, and 500% deformation (M100, M300, M500), tensile strength (σR) and elongation at break
(εR) were recorded.

4.4.6 Self-Healing Protocol
The two broken
sections of tested tensile tests were manually put in contact, and
a minimum pressure was applied for 5 min to ensure adequate contact.
The healing process was carried out for 24 h under two conditions:
a group of samples at 70 °C and another group at room temperature.
Once healed, they were re-tested according to the tensile test procedure
previously described. The healing efficiency (η) was calculated
as a measure of the recovery of tensile properties, according to eq 3 3  where Ppristine and Phealed is the property before and
after the healing protocol.

4.4.7 Optical Profilometry
A surface
scratch was made with a razor blade to the samples. The evolution
of the scratch closure was followed with a Zeta-20 optical profilometer
from Zeta Instruments. Photomicrographs were taken with a magnification
of 20× and the depth profile of the crack was analyzed, taking
care of its calculation in the same position in the damaged state
and in the healed state.

4.4.8 Viscoelastic Properties
The study
of the Payne effect was carried out in a dynamic rheometer DMA Q800
of TA Instruments. The tension configuration was used to perform strain
sweeps between 0.01 and 40% at a frequency of 1 Hz and a temperature
of 25 °C.
