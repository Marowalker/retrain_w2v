Crystal and molecular structures
of new triorganotin complexes
have been determined via X-ray diffraction. These complexes include,
among others, the second polymorph of Ph3Sn(thiocytosine),
the double complex salt Ph3Sn(methimazole)2·Ph3SnCl2, and five-coordinated triphenyltin chloride
with methimazole, tetrahydopyrimidine-2-thione, dimethylformamide,
and dimethyl sulfoxide. Hirshfeld surface analysis allowed for better
visualization and precise pinpointing of the differences between polymorphs
as well as easier analysis of intermolecular interactions. All of
the new structure of the Ph3Sn(L)Cl type displayed interesting
thermal features and therefore were also analyzed via thermogravimetric
analysis/simultaneous thermal analysis/differential scanning calorimetry
methods. These analyses showed the different ways in which these complexes
underwent thermal decomposition. In some cases, to solve the problems
that arose, powder X-ray diffraction analyses have also been performed.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Organotin
compounds (OTCs) are defined as those possessing at least
one tin–carbon covalent bond. The first such compound was synthesized
in 1849 by Frankland,1 but only more than
80 years later was OTC first applied in industry as a stabilizer of
transformer oils.2 Since then, OTCs have
been applied in different areas of life, including the plastics industry
(as PVC stabilizers), agriculture (pesticides), paper industry, brewing,
in cooling systems as antifungal compounds, etc.3,4 However,
for some time, the main interest has been focused on their cytotoxic
activity, which was first described in 1980 by Gielen5 and has been extensively studied since then. Among the
compounds tested against different cancer cell lines, the OTCs with
ligands possessing a sulfur donor have become a significant group.6−13

We have limited our studies to triphenyltin complexes, mainly
but
not exclusively with sulfur donor ligands. The Cambridge Structural
Database (CSD14) search showed that among
triorganotin compounds with a S-donor ligand, the triphenyl compounds
are the most common (62%), while the others such as trimethyl (14%),
tribenzyl (8%), or tricyclohexyl (5%) are far less popular.

We have analyzed the distribution of Sn–S and Sn–Cl
distances for Ph3SnL(S) complexes (Figure 1a,b). The first plot shows that a huge majority
of Sn–S contacts lie within the range of 2.4–2.5 Å,
but a second far less prominent cluster can be found at approximately
2.9 Å. A more detailed analysis allows for a conclusion that
these long Sn–S contacts are found in two types of structures:
polymeric or dimeric ones (three structures) and derivatives of dithiocarboxylic
acids (14 structures), where one of the sulfur atoms is strongly coordinated
(<2.5 Å) and the second contact, due to steric limitations,
is definitely weaker. In case of the Sn–Cl distance, the most
typical value for this bond is approximately 2.45–2.55 Å
(Figure 1b).

This paper outlines three types of organotin compounds of
the general
formulas Ph3SnL, Ph3SnLCl, and Ph3SnL2·Ph3SnCl2, whose structural
formulas have been summarized in Table S1 in the Supporting Information.

2.1 Structural Studies
2.1.1 Ph3SnL
2.1.1.1 Ph3Sn(thiocytosine) (1 Ph3Sn(TC))
The structure of 1 represents the most
common type of triorganotin complex with thioamide
donor ligands. In the majority of cases, a coordination bond involves
a sulfur atom, and it is additionally stabilized by N-donation from
a heterocyclic ring (if such a ring is present). Depending on the
role ascribed to this latter contact, whether it is regarded as the
important coordination bond or not, the Sn environment can be described
as (deformed) trigonal bipyramid (cis isomer, coordination number
of 5) or tetrahedron (cn of 4). The crystal structure of 1 reported here represents the second polymorphic form of this compound.14 In both polymorphs, there are dimers of molecules
connected by N–H···N hydrogen bonds, but in
each case, the packing of those duplexes in the lattice is different.
Selected hydrogen bond parameters for all compounds have been summarized
in Table 1.

The differences between the
polymorphs are observed not only in
their crystal packing but also in the conformations of the complexes,
which differ slightly (cf. Figure 2). The orientations of phenyl rings in the complexes
differ significantly, and as a consequence, so does the orientation
of the secondary Sn–N contacts (polymorph I 3.0009(9) Å,
polymorph II 2.810(4) Å). The influence of coordination is even
more important, since the Sn–S bonds (2.446(6) Å and 2.4280(11)
Å) are almost identical.

2.1.2 Ph3SnLCl
2.1.2.1 Ph3Sn(tetrahydopirymidine-2-thione)
(2, Ph3Sn(tHPMT)Cl), Ph3Sn(methimazole)Cl
(3a, 3b, Ph3Sn(MIMT)Cl)
In these quite unique complexes, the Sn from the triphenyltin fragment
is coordinated by one ligand with a sulfur donor and one chloride
anion. The CDB search shows that only one similar structure has been
published thus far,15 with ethylenethiourea
as a sulfur-donor ligand (Ph3Sn(tHIMT)Cl; cf. Figure 3a). In fact, among
all of the triorganic Sn(IV) complexes, there is only one other example
with Sn coordinated by both S and halogen atoms,16 and in this compound, sulfur and one Sn-bonded carbon belong
to the same organic molecule, which facilitates the coordination of
both elements.

Figure 3 Perspective view of the complexes (a) Ph3Sn(tHIMT)Cl,
(b) 2, (c) 3a, and (d) 3b (only
one of the two disordered positions of MIMT is presented).

The tin atom in compound 2 (Figure 3b) shows a slightly
distorted trigonal bipyramidal
geometry (τ5 parameter17 is 0.76), similar to Ph3Sn(tHIMT)Cl (τ5 = 0.8).15 In both cases, the Sn–C
and Sn–Cl distances have typical values (Figure 1b); however, the Sn–S bond lengths
(Ph3Sn(tHPMT)Cl 2.8330(8) Å, Ph3Sn(tHIMT)Cl
2.8502(5) Å) are significantly longer than the standard value
(approximately 2.5 Å). The packing modes also bear a close resemblance
to each other (Figure 4). The unit-cell similarity index18 for
Ph3Sn(tHPMT)Cl and Ph3Sn(tHIMT)Cl is 0.018,
and the mean elongation is equal to 0.017; therefore, both parameters
indicate a significant degree of isostructurality between those two
crystal lattices (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Crystal packing along the (a) [100] and (b) [010] directions (orange
Ph3Sn(tHPMT)Cl, green 2).

Structure 3a is quite different from those two.
First,
the Sn–S distance is so long (3.2125(9) Å) that this structure
could actually be regarded as a co-crystal (or a molecular complex)
of a free ligand not connected by a coordination bond to the metal
center. However, the values of the Cl–Sn–C angles (94.71(8),
96.27(8), and 99.46(8)°) are closer to those found in Ph3SnLCl complexes (89.78(8)–95.52(8)°) than those
of free triphenyltin chloride (102.50(9)–108.02(9)°).19−21 Moreover, in each structure, there are dimers composed of Ph3SnLCl molecules bonded by N–H···S interactions
between the ligand molecules (Figure 5); finally, assuming the Sn–S contact is a bond,
τ5 is 0.69, which also indicates the possibility
of complex formation.

Figure 5 Dimers of Ph3SnLCl bonded by N–H···S
interactions between the ligands: (a) Ph3Sn(tHIMT)Cl, (b)
Ph3Sn(tHPMT)Cl, and (c) Ph3Sn(MIMT)Cl.

In the structure 3b, the Sn–S distance (2.7620(6)
Å) is much shorter, even shorter than that in Ph3Sn(tHIMT)Cl
or in 2. At the same time, complex 3b does
not form dimeric structures as presented in Figure 5, and this fact is likely a factor that allows
for the disorder of the ligand molecule. The packing is determined
by the N–H···Cl interaction and the stacking
between the methimazole ring and one of the phenyl rings of another
complex molecule at (1/2 + x, 1/2 – y, 1/2 + z).

2.1.3 Ph3SnL2·Ph3SnCl2
2.1.3.1 Ph3Sn(methimazole)2·Ph3SnCl2 (4, Ph3Sn (MIMT)2·Ph3SnCl2)
The double complex salt of triphenyltin presented in Figure 6 is the rare example of a structure
that has both cationic and anionic complexes of triorganotin in the
crystal lattice. The CSD search showed only three examples20 of double triorganotin complexes, where one
of the complexes had two halogen atoms as ligands; however, it is
the only one with an identical organotin core. In two reported structures,
the counter ion has a different organotin derivative than the halogen
one,22,23 and in the third, the quality is so poor
that the organic group of SnR3 has not been established.24 Structure 4 is probably the result
of the ligand exchange between the molecules of complex 3a or 3b. This exchange does not seem to be profitable
due to the creation of either a positively or negatively charged molecule
from a neutral complex, and this may explain the very low yield of
the obtained complex.

Figure 6 Perspective view of the complexes Ph3Sn(MIMT)2·Ph3SnCl2.

The Sn–S bond lengths are 2.720(1) and 2.739(1) Å,
which means that these bonds are definitely longer than those in complexes
of Ph3SnL(S); on the other hand, they are significantly
shorter than that in Ph3SnL(S)Cl. The Sn–Cl bond
lengths are 2.613(1) and 2.626(2) Å, which are quite typical
values for R3SnCl2.

The crystal packing
is mostly determined by N–H···Cl
hydrogen bonds (Figure 7), which form chains along the [010] direction. The structure is
further stabilized by interchain C–H···S and
C–H···Cl interactions.

in complex 4.

It seems to be special for triphenyltin complexes that the
ligand
does not allow for predicting the type of complex that would be formed.
Nevertheless, generally, triphenyltin complexes have propensities
toward a trigonal bipyramidal geometry. In the case of thioamides,
there are two main possibilities of coordination depending on the
accessibility of the thioamide nitrogen atom. When this atom is available
for (even though it is secondary) coordination, then both the sulfur
and deprotonated nitrogen atoms take part in the coordination. Obviously,
the Sn–N-bonded thioamide is questionable, but one should still
take into account its stabilizing character. When, in turn, the nitrogen
atom is protonated or blocked (for example, by a methyl group), there
is no possibility for Sn–N coordination (like in the complex
Ph3SnL(S)Cl or Ph3Sn[LS]2), and this
is compensated by another ligand, which in the examples above is a
halogen atom or a sulfur atom from another molecule. The difficulty
in predicting the product is quite possibly related to the process
of the deprotonation of thioamides, which means that small changes
in the reaction conditions can result in different products. For example,
in the case of methimazole (MIMT), the complexes Ph3SnL(S),25 Ph3SnL(S)Cl (3a, 3b) or Ph3SnL(S)2·Ph3SnX2 (4) were obtained in very similar conditions.

2.1.4 Solvent Molecules as Ligands
In
the course of our studies, we have also obtained two other derivatives
(three structures) with solvent molecules (dimethylformamide (DMF)
and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) coordinated to the metal center. The
crystal structure of Ph3Sn(DMSO)Cl has already been published
by Kumar et al.,26 but we obtained two
new polymorphic forms of this complex.

Ph3Sn(DMF)Cl
(5) and Ph3Sn(DMSO)Cl (6a), (6b) complexes consist of one oxygen donor ligand (solvent)
and one chloride coordinated to the metal center of triphenyltin (Figure 8).

Figure 8 View of the complex (a)
SnPh3(DMF)Cl and (b) one of
the symmetry-independent molecules of SnPh3(DMSO)Cl 6a together with the numbering scheme. Ellipsoids are drawn
at the 50% probability level, and hydrogen atoms are shown as spheres
of arbitrary radii.

The complex Ph3Sn(DMSO)Cl has been obtained in two new
polymorphic forms, β 6a and γ 6b, which are both monoclinic and both contain two symmetry-independent
molecules in the asymmetric part of unit cell, in contrast to the
already published α-orthorhombic form,26 with only one complex in the asymmetric unit. The γ form appeared
to be unstable and transformed after few days into the β form.

In each case, the Sn–O and Sn–Cl bond distances are
in a range typical for similar compounds (Sn–O 2.356(2)–2.482(9)
Å, Sn–Cl 2.467(3)–2.509(3) Å). The crystal
architectures are mainly dominated by C–H···Cl
interactions, forming chains along the [010] 5, 6b and [101] 6a directions. These chains, however,
adopt different shapes (cf. Figure 9).

Figure 9 Chains of molecules connected by weak hydrogen bonds: 5 (red, top), 6b (middle, green), and 6a (bottom, blue).

Due to the quite a wide
range of Sn–S distances in the presented
structures, we have performed topological analysis of Sn–S
for 1–4, whose results are summarized
in Table 2.

Sn–S Bond in 1–4
structure	atoms	Gcp (kJ mol–1 bohr–3)	Vcp (kJ mol–1 bohr–3)	D12 (Å)	ρbcp (e Å–3)	∇2 (e Å–5)	
1	Sn1–S20	142.19	–192.15	2.4280	0.4436	3.39	
2	Sn1–S20	53.07	–67.7	2.8330	0.2356	1.37	
3a	Sn1–S20	25.20	–29.12	3.2124	0.1342	0.78	
3b	Sn1–S20	62.35	–81.75	2.7610	0.2627	1.58	
4	Sn1–S20	65.23	–85.80	2.7397	0.2708	1.64	
 	Sn–S25	68.37	–90.18	2.7198	0.2793	1.71	
Both the positive values of Laplacian and rather small
values of
electron density at the critical points indicate the closed-shell
nature of these bonds. Obviously, the strongest Sn–S bond was
found in structure 1, and actually it seems to be the
only one that can be classified as a coordinate bond, the other should
be rather characterized as semicoordinate ones due to the long Sn–S
distances and Laplacian values closer to the intermolecular interactions
than to covalent bonds.

2.1.5 Hirshfeld Fingerprint
Analysis
The Hirshfeld fingerprint plots are included in
the Supporting Information. Only compound 3b has
been excluded from this analysis due to its structural disorder. For
salt 4, the fingerprints for the whole salt as well as
for the separate cationic and anionic parts are presented in order
to stress the complementarity of both parts.

A comparison between 2 and Ph3Sn(tHIMT)Cl shows that, despite the high
similarity in the structure packing and consequently in the intermolecular
interactions, the fingerprints differ rather significantly. Obviously,
the shapes of both plots are similar, but some relevant differences
are clear, including the presence of the diffuse spread of points
in the upper right corner (diffuse blue tail) for 2,
which indicates a small cavity in the crystal, and may suggest a type
of nonoptimal packing, and different shapes of “wings”,
which for 2 are obviously sharper and reach lower (to
smaller distances), indicate a more directional character of the C–H···π
interactions in 2 than in Ph3Sn(tHIMT)Cl.

The additional −CH2– group in compound 2 results in an increasing contribution of H···H
contacts, while the importance of others (C···H, S···H,
N···H) decreases in comparison with the picture determined
for interactions in Ph3Sn(tHIMT)Cl.

The two polymorphs
of 6 show different packing modes.
In 6a, the packing is dominated by hydrogen bond interactions,
while in 6b, the main feature of the plot are wings,
which correspond to the C–H···π interactions.
Moreover, the obviously more diffused blue tail in 6b signals a nonoptimal packing mode, which corresponds to the instability
of this polymorph.

It can also be noticed that even the comparison
of the two symmetry-independent
molecules of each of the polymorphs shows remarkable differences in
their 2-D fingerprint plots. For polymorph 6a, this effect
comes from the different hydrogen bond synthons. In molecule A, the
chlorine atom acts as an acceptor for one weak hydrogen bond, which
can be observed as a narrow sharp peak at approximately 2.6 Å,
while the same peak in molecule B is broadened, obviously as a consequence
of the presence of the trifurcated hydrogen bond. Furthermore, the
donors of hydrogen bonds mainly come from molecule B, which can be
seen as prominent spikes at the bottom and middle right of the plot.
In the case of 6b, the C–H···Cl
hydrogen bonding is also present, but due to the long distance between
the donor and acceptor, it is superposed with wings.

2.1.6 Thermal Analysis
We have performed
thermal analysis for SnPh3(L)Cl type complexes.

In
the course of the thermal analysis of SnPh3(tHIMT)Cl with
the Boethius apparatus, we have observed an effect resembling a phase
transition (Figure 10) at approximately 160 °C. The single crystals of SnPh3(tHIMT)Cl had melted at this temperature, and then, new ones were
formed. The movie presenting this effect is included in the Supporting
Information (Movie S1).

Figure 10 Subsequent phases of
the structural change of crystals of Ph3Sn(tHIMT)Cl (2) and Ph3Sn(DMF)Cl (5).

Furthermore, new crystals were still in equilibrium
with a liquid
phase, thus we hypothesized that the complex actually decomposed into
the substrates (the melting point of Ph3SnCl is 108 °C
and that of tHIMT is 203 °C). To test this hypothesis, we performed
the thermogravimetric analysis (TG)/differential thermal analysis
(DTA) analysis (Supporting Information).
The DTA curve has three prominent endothermic peaks, with the most
intense one at 160 °C related to complex decomposition. The second
less intense peak at 182 °C is caused by the melting of one of
the products of decomposition, and at 240 °C, there is another
peak accompanied by the deflection point of the TG curve. This is
the vaporization temperature of SnPh3Cl, and the mass deficit
is exactly that of triphenyltin chloride, which supports the possibility
of the decomposition of Ph3Sn(tHPMT)Cl into its substrates.
Nevertheless, to confirm the decomposition, X-ray powder diffraction
data were additionally collected (see the Powder
X-ray Diffraction section).

Somewhat surprisingly, complex 2, with similar structure
and packing as that of SnPh3(tHIMT)Cl, does not show a
similar effect, and it melts quietly at 191.1 °C (Movie S2). We have confirmed it by obtaining
crystals from vapors of melted compound 2, which turned
out to be complex 1. Moreover, we perform two STA analyses
with different heating rates (hr). As melting is not a time-dependent
transition, its onset temperature should not depend significantly
on the heating rate, contrary to the decomposition process, for which
the peak should shift to higher temperatures with increasing heating
rates. In both STA curves, with the heating rates of 10 and 20 °C
min–1 (cf. Supporting Information), the endothermic signal occurs at approximately 191 °C (191.1/191.4
°C).

Similar studies have been performed for complexes 3a (Movie S3) and 3b (Movie S4). For the former, at 120 °C,
the
sample begins to decompose with the release of the characteristic
smell of triphenyltin chloride. Additionally, in this case, the differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses with different heating rates have
been performed, and it turned out that depending on the heating rate
(hr), the onset of the endothermic signal moves from 123.3 °C
for a hr of 1 °C min–1, through 124.4 °C
for a hr of 10 °C min–1, to 125.4 °C for
a hr of 20 °C min–1 (STA curves are included
in the Supporting Information).

For
compound 3b, the decomposition/melting observed
under the Boethius apparatus starts at a much lower temperature in
comparison to that in 3a [at approximately 100 °C
(hr of 5 °C min–1)], and consequently, the
crystallization of a new phase is observed (Movie S4, Supporting Information, cf. Figure 11). It appears that the crystallization occurs
only at the surface of the crystal, and if the complexes start to
decompose to substrates, then it is probably MIMT that starts to crystallize
on the crystal surface. Due to the temperature at which the new phase
appears, ca. 100–115 °C, it seems to be unlikely that
Ph3SnCl crystallizes, as its melting point is 108 °C.
The new crystals together with the base one start to melt at approximately
120 °C. The STA analysis does not show the clear effects of this
transition, and actually there are observable but very subtle effects
on the DSC curve at approximately 110 °C, which are probably
connected with the appearance of the new crystals (STA analysis performed
with a hr of 20 °C min–1).

Figure 11 Subsequent phases of
structural change of crystals of 3b at (a) 60 °C
and (b) 110 °C.

Similar effects to those observed for Ph3Sn(tHIMT)Cl
have been observed for complex 5 with DMF. At 74.7 °C,
the crystal starts forming a new phase (Movie S5 and Figure 10), but in this case, the new crystals are not in equilibrium with
the liquid. They turned out to be Ph3SnCl (monoclinic II
phase) and started to melt belatedly. Both effects were observed in
the DSC curve as one wide endothermic signal. When the same sample
was cooled (1 °C min–1), at 55.2 °C crystallization
started, also causing the visible effects in the DCS curves such as
a narrow exothermic peak ascribed to the crystallization of triphenyltin
chloride. The same sample has been heated up to 120 °C, and the
endothermic effect was observed in the range of 97.9–104.5
°C, which can be ascribed to the melting of SnPh3Cl.

The thermal behavior of the monoclinic β form of Ph3Sn(DMSO)Cl (6a) has also been studied. The results show
that decomposition also occurs in this case, but the transformation
is not similar to that observed in Ph3Sn(tHIMT)Cl or 5. Upon first analysis, the observation of the small crystals
under the Boethius apparatus seemed to suggest that they melt close
to 120 °C, which is above the melting point of either DMSO or
SnPh3Cl. However, the detailed DSC analysis definitely
shows a higher thermal phenomenon than this. Therefore, it turned
out that in the case of 6a, it is better to investigate
bigger crystals, which allows more subtle effects to also be observed
(Movie S6). Shortly below 100 °C on
the surface of the sample, the new crystalline phase occurs, and it
corresponds to the small exothermic effects in the DSC curves. Then,
those newly created crystals transform into the new phase (other small
exothermic signals) and finally melt (probably the first endothermic
signal), after which Ph3Sn(DMSO)Cl is decomposes. The same
sample was cooled (1 °C min–1), and at 55.2
°C, the exothermic effect of crystallization was observed (analogously
to 5). Then, upon a second heating, the endothermic effect, corresponding
to the melting of Ph3SnCl, appeared at approximately 108
°C. What is interesting in this case is the occurrence of monoclinic
I SnPh3Cl.

Based on that analysis, we assume that
the crystals of SnPh3(DMSO)Cl start to decompose at approximately
100 °C,
forming the crystals of Ph3SnCl on their surfaces, which
protect them from further decomposition, and at 113 °C, the crystals
on the surface melt, after which 6a decomposes. The hypothesis
regarding the decomposition of the samples is supported by the crystallization
of triphenyltin chloride upon cooling, which should not be observed
in the case of pure melting.

2.1.7 Powder
X-ray Diffraction
The powder
diffractograms, both experimental and those generated for the single-crystal
structures, are given as the Supporting Information. Due to the interesting thermal processes for Ph3Sn(tHIMT)Cl,
powder diffraction patterns were collected for a sample heated to
ca. 170 °C and cooled rapidly or slowly (by “rapid cooling”,
we mean taking the sample from the Boethius apparatus and leaving
it at room temperature; by “slow cooling”, we mean at
−5 °C min–1). Figure 11 displays the comparison of these patterns
(K1-rapid cooling and K2-slow cooling) with those of the substrates
(S1-Ph3SnCl and S2-tHIMT), complex Ph3Sn(tHIMT)Cl
without heating (K), and the mixture of substrates (M12). The analysis
of Figure 11 suggests
the influence of the cooling rate on the resulting products. Upon
slow cooling, almost certainly the starting complex with some addition
of substrates (signal at 2θ = 9.6°) is obtained, whereas
rapid cooling results in the opposite phenomenon. The diffractogram
is similar to that collected for the mixture of substrates. This observation
strongly supports the hypothesis of the decomposition of the complex
into its starting compounds. What is intriguing is that the X-ray
analysis of the mixture of substrates shows the peaks characteristic
for the complex (2θ = 10.9 and 16.16°), which can suggest
that the complex was also obtained by a mechanochemical reaction during
the grinding of the substrates. Therefore, in the case of sample K1,
it is difficult to say if the presence of the complex is the effect
of the re-establishment of SnPh3(tHIMT)Cl during the cooling
or the grinding of the substrates together (Figure 12).

Figure 12 Powder diffraction patterns of 2: K1-(2) heated
to 170 °C
and rapidly cooled, K2-(2) heated to 170 °C and slowly cooled,
M12-substrate mixture, S1-tHIMT, S2-Ph3SnCl, and K-Ph3Sn(tHIMT)Cl.

Similar analyses have been performed for 3a, 3b, 5, and 6a. In the two latter
cases, the powder XRD studies confirmed the assumption of thermal
decomposition.

For compound 5, two types of experiments
have been
performed after the collection of powder XRD data. First, the sample
was heated to the temperature of decomposition (ca. 80 °C) and
cooled rapidly or slowly before the newly created crystals melt; second,
the sample was heated to a temperature higher than the melting point
of the new arising crystals (ca. 110 °C). In each case, the obtained
compound was triphenyltin chloride, but it crystallized in different
polymorphic forms. We conducted each experiment twice.

When
the sample was heated to 110 °C and rapidly cooled, the
triphenyltin chloride crystallized as the monoclinic I polymorphic
form, the same form that was obtained after the slow cooling in the
first experiment, but the second trial resulted in the hexagonal form
being obtained in addition to the monoclinic I form.

In the
second approach, when the sample was heated to 80 °C,
the results of both trials of slow cooling were alike, and the obtained
compound was a mixture of the monoclinic I and II forms of SnPh3Cl. For rapid cooling, the first experiment showed pure monoclinic
form II, while the second experiment again showed a mixture of the
monoclinic I and II forms of SnPh3Cl.

Compound 6a was heated until the temperature was higher
than the temperature of decomposition and then cooled rapidly or slowly,
and then, the powder X-ray data were collected. In both cases, SnPh3Cl in the monoclinic I form was recognized, which confirms
the hypothesis of the decomposition of this compound (monoclinic I),
while the second trial also resulted in the addition of the hexagonal
form of SnPh3Cl.

For 3a, the powder
X-ray diffractograms have been
collected the day after the decomposition due to the long period of
crystallization (several hours from the decomposition to the appearance
of crystals). Unfortunately, most of the sample created an amorphic
phase with only a very small amount of crystals. The PXRD analysis
shows lines corresponding to the complex.

In turn, powder X-ray
diffractograms for 3b have been
collected two days after the decomposition, again due to long time
of crystallization; after one day, a few crystal could be observed,
but they were too few to perform the PXRD experiment. The PXRD analysis
of the crystals shows lines corresponding to complexes 3a and 3b.

Based on the PXRD and STA results, it
can be assumed that complexes 3a and 3b decompose
and not melt. Because both
substrates are stable at 130°C (the first mass loss starts above
200 °C), the re-establishment of both 3a and 3b is highly possible. Complex 3a is formed at
high temperature, and therefore, it is always the first to occur,
which is why we observed it in both cases.

3 Summary
During these studies, several new triphenyltin complexes
were prepared
and structurally analyzed, showing some interesting structural features.
Among others, the solid-state structure of Ph3Sn(MIMT)2·Ph3SnCl2 has been described as
the first structure that included both a cationic and anionic complex
of triphenyltin in the crystal lattice. The Sn–S bond lengths
are 2.720(1) and 2.739(1) Å; thus, the bonds are significantly
longer than in the case of complexes of Ph3SnL but also
shorter than in the case of Ph3SnLCl. This exceptional
example of an organotin complex is the third example of a complex
of MIMT with triphenyltin, which confirms that very subtle changes
in the reaction conditions (like a solvent change, etc.) can result
in different complexes being obtained.

The Ph3SnL(S)Cl-type
complexes are also quite unique,
as they contain both sulfur donor and halogen atom ligands coordinated
to the tin atom. Such complexes are stable in the open air and generally
decompose into substrates at higher temperatures, but they re-establish
the complex structure during cooling. The products obtained during
cooling strongly depend on the cooling rate. The only structure of
this type that did not decompose is Ph3Sn(tHPMT)Cl, which
is surprising considering its high similarity with SnPh3(tHIMT)Cl. Moreover, Ph3Sn(tHIMT)Cl can also be obtained
(however with a small efficiency) as a result of a mechanochemical
reaction by grinding, as confirmed by PXRD.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Synthesis
4.1.1 Ph3Sn_TC (1)
Thiocytisine dissolved in
ethanol (0.25 mmol) was treated with equivalent
amount of NaOH Clear solution, stirred for a while, and then triphenyltin
chloride dissolved in acetone was added. The mixture was stirred and
heated under reflux at 60° for 1 h. A clear colorless solution
was left to crystallize. The obtained colorless crystals were suitable
for X-ray diffraction.

4.1.2 Ph3Sn_tHPMT_Cl
(2)
3,4,5,6-Tetrahydro-2-pyrimidinethiol (1mmol),
dissolved
in methanol, was treated with equivalent amount triphenyltin chloride
dissolved in acetone. The mixture was stirred at room temperature
for 1 h. A clear colorless solution was left to crystallize. The obtained
colorless crystals were suitable for X-ray diffraction.

4.1.3 Ph3Sn_MIMT_Cl (3a)
Methimazole
(0.5 mmol), dissolved in acetonitrile, was
treated with equivalent amount of triphenyltin chloride dissolved
in ethyl acetate added in 3 portions. The mixture was stirred at higher
temperature for at least 2 h. A clear colorless solution was left
to crystallize. The obtained colorless crystals were suitable for
X-ray diffraction. When the solution was stirred for less then 2 h,
the mixture of (3) and (5) was obtained.

4.1.4 Ph3Sn_MIMT_Cl (3b)
Methimazole (0.5 mmol), dissolved in acetonitrile, was
treated with equivalent amount of triphenyltin chloride dissolved
in ethyl acetate added in 3 portions. The mixture was stirred at room
temperature for 1 h. A clear colorless solution was left to crystallize.
The obtained colorless crystals were suitable for X-ray diffraction.

4.1.5 Ph3Sn_MIMT2–Ph3SnCl2 (4)
Methimazole (0.5
mmol), dissolved in methanol/ethanol mixture, was treated with equivalent
amount of triphenyltin chloride dissolved in acetone. The mixture
was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. A clear colorless solution
was left to crystallize. Only very few colorless crystals were suitable
for X-ray diffraction.

4.1.6 SnPh3Cl_DMF
(5)
Triphenyltin chloride was dissolved in DMF
and left to crystallize.
After few days, colorless crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction
were obtained.

4.1.7 SnPh3Cl_DMF
(6a)
Triphenyltin chloride was dissolved in
DMSO and left to crystallize.
After few days, colorless crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction
were obtained.

In case of compounds (5) and (6a), a byproduct (Ph4Sn) always crystallizes first,
and after that the complex.

4.1.8 SnPh3Cl_DMF (6b)
Triphenyltin chloride was
dissolved in DMSO and left to crystallize.
After few days, but before crystal started to occur, few drops of
the solution were moved to the evaporation glass where after few minutes
(6b) crystallized together in orthorhombic form. The
metastable form (6b) transform to form (6a) after a few days. The repetition of this experiment always results
in obtaining (6a) from the beginning; (6b) polymorph could not be obtained again.

4.2 X-ray Crystallography
X-ray diffraction
data were collected by the ω-scan technique on a four-circle
XCalibur diffractometer (Agilent Technologies) equipped with an Eos
detector27 equipped with a graphite-monochromized
Mo Kα radiation source (λ = 0.71073 Å) or a supernova
diffractometer (Agilent Technologies) using monochromatic Cu Kα
radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å). The temperature was controlled
with an Oxford Instruments Cryosystem device. The data were corrected
for Lorentz-polarization effects as well as for absorption (multiscan).28 Accurate unit-cell parameters were determined
by a least-squares fit of the reflections of the highest intensity,
which were chosen from the whole experiment. The calculations were
mainly performed within the WinGX program system29 and OLEX.30 The structures were
solved with ShelxT31/SIR9232 and refined with the full-matrix least-squares procedure
on F2 by SHELXL-2017.33 Scattering
factors incorporated in SHELXL were used. All nonhydrogen atoms were
refined anisotropically, and hydrogen atoms were located at the calculated
positions and refined as a “riding model” with isotropic
thermal parameters fixed at 1.2 times the Ueq of the appropriate carrier atom for compounds 2, 3a, 4, 5, 6a, and 6b or treated by a mixture of independent and constrained
refinement for (1). Hirshfeld surfaces/fingerprints have
been established using CrystalExplorer software.34 The topological analysis has been performed using MoPro
software.35
