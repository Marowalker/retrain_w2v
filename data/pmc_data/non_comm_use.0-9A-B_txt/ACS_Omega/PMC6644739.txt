The
design and synthesis of heteroatom-doping porous materials
with unique surface/interfaces are of great significance for enhancing
the sensitive surface performance in the fields of catalytic energy,
especially gas sensor, CO oxidation, and ammonium perchlorate decomposition.
Usually, the template method followed by a high-temperature calcination
process is considered as the routes of choice in preparing ion-doped
porous materials, but it requires extra templates and will undergo
complicated steps. Here, we present a simple fusion/diffusion-controlled
intermetallics-transformation method to synthesize various heteroatom-doping
porous SnO2 only by changing the species of intermetallics.
By this new method, Ni-doped popcornlike SnO2 with plenty
of ∼30 nm pores and two kinds of Cu-doped SnO2 nanocages
was successfully constructed. Phase-evolution investigations demonstrated
that growth kinetics, diffusion, and solubility of the intermediates
are highly related to the architecture of final products. Moreover,
low-solid-solution limit of MOx (M: Ni,
Cu) in SnO2 made the ion dope close to the surface to form
a special surface/interfaces structure, and selective removal of MOx produce abundant pores to increase the surface
area. As a consequence, Ni-doped composite exhibits higher sensitivity
in formaldehyde detection with a relative low-operating temperature
in a short response time (i.e., 23.7–50 ppm formaldehyde, 170
°C, and 5 s) and Cu-doped composites show excellent activity
in decreasing the catalytic temperature of CO oxidation and ammonium
perchlorate decomposition. The fusion/diffusion-controlled intermetallics-transformation
method reported in this work could be readily adopted for the synthesis
of other active heteroatom-doping porous materials for multipurpose
uses.

1 Introduction
Modified
surface/interfaces with more internal and outside active
sites would provide an excellent platform for catalytic reactions
because most of the catalytic reactions are found to be influenced
by the structure of surface or interfaces.1−7 Heteroatom doping is a promising route to decorate the microstructures
including the surface/interfaces structure of materials because the
previous study demonstrated that doping metal ions into semiconductors
could regulate the Fermi level and activate the lattice oxygen. Using
such a chemistry, one is able to create excellent catalytic materials
for environmental and energy applications.8 However, simple ion doping could not meet the higher requirement
with the development of materials science and technology. More efficient
and multifunction materials are needed. Thus, pore-creating becomes
a good way to further modify the architecture of material and increase
its surface activity sites to improve their gas adsorption and sensing
ability, energy storage capacity, and many other intriguing merits.9−12 Consequently, porous semiconductors with heteroatom doping would
become excellent multifunctional materials if the special surface/interfaces
structure and open-pore channels could be derived from the doping
ions and architecture of pores.

Many strategies have been reported
for pore-creation, which include
soft/hard template methods. With these literature methods, varied
porous structures such as molecular sieve (e.g., dual-mesoporous organosilica
nanoparticles),13 hollow (e.g., hollow
Co3O4 nanocages, SnO2–Fe2O3–C hollow sphere),14,15 and yolk–shell (e.g., Au@NiO, Fe3O4@SiO2) structures have been synthesized successfully.16,17 Despite these progresses, the conventional inserted template strategy
often needs extra templates and multistep processes. Afterward, the
development of self-template strategy simplified the procedures and
expanded the diversity of porous materials. CoSn(OH)6 hollow
nanoboxes,18 CoMn2O4 hollow microcubes, NiCo2O4 hollow sphere,
and NiCo2S4 ball in ball-hollow sphere could
be synthesized.19−22 However, it still suffers difficulties in preparing porous materials
with desired architectures and barely accessible to synthesize semiconductors
merited with pores and heteroatom doping as well. It appears that
searching for simple methodologies of preparing porous materials with
heteroatom doping would enrich the multifunctional material system,
which would further affect the scientific and technological applications.

Herein, we took porous SnO2 as a model semiconductor
to study because it has a plenty of rutile-phase counterparts (e.g.,
TiO2, VO2) with many uses. Considering that,
for ion doping, high-temperature calcination and/or high-pressure
hydrothermal reactions are frequently used to import metal ions into
the matrix in virtue of a strong driving force.23 We designed a simple route that transform Sn-containing
intermetallics to porous SnO2 semiconductors with a heteroatom
doping through calcination and subsequent acid-etching process. The
first step affords heteroatom doping in some regions through ion diffusion
between solids, and the second step will produce more accessible pores
in between the SnO2 particles. Such a strategy is based
on our considerations: (i) the doping type of metal in the porous
semiconductors relies on the choice of metal compositions in intermetallic
compounds, (ii) the doping content relies on the solid solubility
limit of the dopants in the final oxides, and (iii) the architecture
of the final porous semiconductor is relative to the growth kinetics
of intermediates MOx (M: Ni, Cu, and Co).
If the excess of transition metal oxides were selectively removed,
one may expect to get heteroatom doping SnO2 semiconductors
with pores around. With this strategy, Cu-doped nanocages, SnO2 derived from Sn–Cu, and Ni-doped popcornlike porous
SnO2 from Sn–Ni intermetallics were synthesized
successfully. These materials are strikingly featured by special surface/interfaces
structure and open-pore channels, which show promising performance
in catalytic field, pollutant detection, and control. This method
reported here provides a picture that intermetallics could be excellent
precursors to fabricate multicavity heteroatom doping semiconductors
with diverse nanostructures for multipurpose uses.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Transformation of Sn-Containing
Intermetallics
to Diverse Heteroatom-Doping Porous SnO2
Here,
we initiated a new route to prepare diverse heteroatom-doped porous
SnO2 through a transformation from Sn-containing intermetallics,
differing from the conventional template methods ever used which need
extra templates and will undergo complicated procedures. The key to
this route is the transformation reaction. To make clear the transformation
process for diverse porous SnO2, we prepared four kinds
of Sn-containing intermetallic compounds (Cu3Sn, Cu6Sn5, Sn–Ni, and Sn–Co) following
the procedure reported in our previous work.24 These intermetallic compounds were taken as precursors for the transformation,
which underwent an oxidization reaction in O2 atmosphere
and a subsequent acid etching by hydrothermal condition. Prior to
the oxidization reaction, the optimum oxidation temperature of the
precursors was initially determined by thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA)–differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) data analysis.
As indicated in Figure S2, the onset oxidation
temperature is about 200–300 °C, whereas the terminated
transformation temperature is about 800–900 °C for all
of these intermetallic precursors. Thus, we selected 800 °C as
the calcination temperature for the following transformations under
the considerations that at this temperature, there would be complete
oxidation. As indicated by XRD in Figure S3, all Sn-containing intermetallic precursors transformed to the corresponding
mixed oxides completely after calcinations at 800 °C. Except
for SCo-800, acid-etching of the resultant mixed oxides (SN-800, SC1-800,
and SC2-800) produces a pure tetragonal-phase SnO2 with
a space group of P42/mnm (JCPDS, no. 41-1445) (Figures 1g and S2). This transformation
relies on the selective dissolution of the component oxides. For instance,
component oxides such as NiO, CuO, and Co3O4 are relatively easier to be dissolved in an acid solution, whereas
SnO2 is on reverse, resulting in the formation of porous
SnO2-based products. Products originated from intermetallic
Sn–Co did not form porous SnO2-based materials,
which is probably because of the relative low solubility of Co3O4 in acid condition, consistent with the results
previously reported.25 From the photograph
in Figures 1c and 2, one could clearly see colored acid aqueous solutions
which suggest partial or complete removal of NiO, Co3O4, or CuO from their mixed oxidations. Representative scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
images demonstrate that three kinds of porous SnO2-based
products were successfully synthesized (Figures 1 and 2). Meanwhile,
SN-800H derived from intermetallic Sn–Ni shows a popcornlike
geometry, whereas both SC1-800H derived from intermetallics Cu6Sn5 and SC2-800H from Cu3Sn showed the
well-shaped nanocage architectures. In spite of the residual Co3O4 in SCo-800H, the skeleton of polyhedron remained
with Co3O4 aggregated in between particles (Figures 2, S4, and 3).

Different from SC1-800H and SC2-800H,
SN-800H inherits the skeleton
of the precursor Sn–Ni, forming a multicavity popcornlike porous
SnO2. TEM and N2 adsorption/desorption were
carried out to investigate the inner architecture of SN-800H (Figure 1h). It is seen that
popcornlike porous SnO2 is constituted by plenty of nanoparticles
with a size in the range of 17–34 nm, leaving some ∼30
nm pores in between the particles. In contrast, the other two porous
SnO2 derived from the precursor Sn–Cu showed nanocage
microstructures with a large cavity in the middle and multigaps outside.
Measurements of size and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
surface area of diverse porous SnO2 were conducted with
an aim to describe the morphology features digitally. As indicated
by XRD patterns in Figure 4a, different half-width at half-maximum for final porous SnO2 products suggested distinct sizes. Thus, we calculated the
particle size from XRD data using Scherrer formula. Results showed
that porous SnO2 derived from Sn–Cu intermetallics
(Cu6Sn5 and Cu3Sn) showed a relatively
larger size (∼79 nm for SC1-800H and ∼46 nm for SC2-800H)
than SnO2 (∼25 nm) when fabricated by Sn–Ni,
similar to the tendency of statistics data from SEM images. The smaller
crystal size of SN-800H might be because of the confined growth of
SnO2 caused by NiO–SnO2 interactions
and doping-effect-induced growth inhibition. Compared to the variations
in particle size, BET surface area showed a reversed trend, which
is logical (Table S3). The BET surface
area of SN-800H is calculated to be 10.4 m2/g, which is
larger than that of SC2-800H (8.8 m2/g) and SC1-800H (3.6
m2/g).

From calcination to acid etching, multistep treatments under
high-temperature
and high-pressure hydrothermal conditions might import foreign ions
(i.e., Ni, Cu, and Co) into SnO2 because of ion diffusion.
To make sure of this possibility, EDS elemental mapping images were
recorded to determine the chemical composition of porous SnO2. As shown in Figure S6, weak but uniform
Cu signals are seen throughout the SnO2 nanoparticles,
which signified a homogenous doping of Cu. Similarly, from EDS line
and EDS mapping, one can see that Ni and Sn signals rise and fall
in turns and tend to become uniform after acid etching, and Ni was
well-distributed in SN-800H particles. Cu and Ni signals were captured
in XPS spectra and quantified by EDS spectra (Figures 1i and S7, Table S2), which gives a common specification
that the multistep methodology reported in this work would acquire
metal-doped porous SnO2. Doping contents for these porous
SnO2 detected by EDS were found within the scope of 1–2
at. %, typically a low-level doping ratio suitable for many catalytic
reactions.26,27

To verify successful doping
and grasp more information on the unit
cell structure of diverse porous SnO2 prepared by the current
method, lattice parameters were calculated using least-squares method
from XRD patterns. Rietveld refinement results in Table 1 showed that the cell volume V and lattice parameter (c or a) of samples SC1-800H and SC2-800H are obviously increased when compared
to bulk SnO2. This observation indicates that Cu2+ ions might incorporate into the lattice site of SnO2 crystal
and elevate the lattice constant because Cu2+ (rCu2+ = 0.073 nm) is larger than Sn4+ (rSn4+ = 0.069 nm).
However, there is no obvious change for SN-800H, which might be because
of the fact that the ion radius of Ni2+ (rNi2+ = 0.069 nm) is equivalent to Sn4+. From the viewpoint of electronic structure, ionic doping would
generate impurity levels and decrease the band gap energy. Hence,
we investigated the variation in band gaps (Eg) through measuring UV–vis diffuse reflection spectra
of the samples. Pure SnO2 is a direct-type semiconductor
with a gap of Eg = 3.6 eV, and its diffuse
reflection spectrum is represented by a single-peak absorbance under
ultraviolet region only.28 Out of what
one expects, from Figure 4c, one can see that the current-doped porous SnO2 showed two peaks in the ultraviolet region and expanded the absorbance
edge to visible light. It might be because of the doping of foreign
ions. For catalytic application, surface species play important roles,
especially oxygen vacancies and surface-absorbed oxygen. High-temperature
calcination under O2 will reduce the oxygen vacancies,
however, ionic doping and subsequent acid etching might generate defects.
Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) is an effective means to detect
single electron trapped by oxygen vacancies or surface oxygen with
a g factor at around 2.29 As shown in Figure 4d, a valley appeared
at about g = 2, which is associated with a signal
of O– or electron trapped by surface defects. All-porous
SnO2 showed a signal around g = 2 under
a thermal excitation at 450 K, and this signal became more obvious
for SN-800H and SC1800H. O 1s core-level XPS spectra for all of these
samples are shown in Figure S8, which exhibit
three peaks: the first one at the lowest binding energy of about 530.2
eV is attributed to the lattice oxygen of Cu–O or Ni–O;
the second peak in the middle at a binding energy of about 530.6 eV
can be identified to the lattice oxygen of Sn–O; and the third
peak located in the highest energy of about 532.5 eV is deemed as
O species adsorbed in oxygen vacancy. The peak area of SN-800H at
532.5 eV is greater than that in other areas, indicating the highest
oxygen vacancy concentration of SN-800H, consistent with the EPR results.

2.2 Phase/Shape Evolution and the Relevant Mechanism
during Transformation
It should be pointed out that apart
from the large hollow in SC1-800H and SC2-800H, SN-800H showed multicavity
property with popcorn morphology, which may be because of the distinct
thermodynamic behavior of CuO and NiO. In the former case, CuO exhibits
a faster growth rate, higher oxidation, and diffusion ability when
compared to those of NiO. As a result, there occurs a serious structure
destruction of cavernous Sn–Cu after high-temperature calcination.
On the contrary, the popcorn morphology of Sn–Ni and the polyhedral
shape of Sn–Co were maintained after calcination. This phenomenon
is consistent with the observation from Figure 2b2, where CuO showed large agglomerates
and complete phase separation from SnO2, exactly opposite
to that of the uniform NiO–SnO2 and Co3O4–SnO2. However, it seems difficult
to attribute the complete phase separation of CuO from SnO2 in SC1-800 only to the rapid growth of CuO; after all, crushed fragments
coming from fast expansion of CuO covered on SnO2 particles
did not exist. From Figure 2b2, one can see that a phase movement might occur
during the calcination process, and we guess that there is a fusion
behavior of intermetallics. Thus, we checked the phase diagram of
binary metal alloy to find the melting point, as listed in Table 2. We found that Sn–Cu
series own a relatively low melting point around 500–600 °C,
whereas Sn–Ni or Sn–Co possesses a melting point higher
than 1000 °C. For veracity, we tested the melting point (Tm) under N2 and the complete oxidization
temperature (To) under O2 atmosphere
using TGA–DSC measurement (Figure 5). There is a sharp endothermic peak around
700 °C without mass changes, which presents a phase transition,
that is, fusion. The higher melting point in TGA-DSC results than
phase diagram might be because of the insufficient heat under small
crucible in the thermogravimetric measurement. As expected, no endothermic
peak appeared in Sn–Ni below 1000 °C. Thus, we suspect
that there is a relation between the melting point and final architecture.
Samples with higher Tm restrained phase
separation, whereas those with lower Tm promoted phase moving. When dealing precursors with calcination
temperature (T): To < T < Tm, the skeleton of the
precursor remained. Considering that To is not a fixed value because oxidation is a kinetic process under
control not only by temperature (T) but also by time
(t), we put an unclear variable value (Tx) on To.
As shown in Figure 6, when selecting a calcination temperature between Tm and To (±Tx), inherited-shape metal-doped porous
SnO2 would be obtained, and when the calcination temperature
is lower than Tm, the final products show
an unclear shape.

To investigate
the phase and shape-evolution process along with
the sintering temperature, we took Cu3Sn and Sn–Ni
as examples. Low-temperature oxidation environment (400 °C) means
a slow oxidation rate, and only the surface composition could be oxidized
to MOx–SnO2 (Figure 7a,e). After the acid-etching,
apart from the nanosized SnO2 grain attached on the outside,
the major skeleton and composition of precursors maintained (Figure 7b,f). The oxidation
degree enhanced as the calcination temperature increased, and the
precursors were almost oxidized to MOx–SnO2 by treating at 600 °C for 2 h (Figure S9). Porous SnO2 was obtained
after acid etching. The morphology of SN-600H is similar to SN-800H
as well as the precursor Sn–Ni, indicating an inheritance of
the initial shape. However, SC2-600H showed a broken morphology, which
verified our inference. It is just similar to a hollow architecture,
not the same as the nanocages of SC2-800H, which may be because of
its relatively lower diffusion rate than 800 °C. The formation
of a hollowlike shape can be explained by Kirkendall effect.30 When elevating the sintering temperature to
800 °C, as described before, SN-800 inherited the shape well,
whereas SC2-800 was separated into two portions. This viewpoint would
provide a speculation that Sn-containing intermetallics, especially
Sn–Ni, are excellent precursors to fabricate multicavity porous
SnO2 with a desired nanostructure using heteroatom doping.

2.3 Multicatalytic Applications of the Heteroatom-Doping
Porous SnO2 Derived from the Transformations
2.3.1 Gas Sensoring
Because heteroatom-doping
porous SnO2 has unique composition and morphology that
endow it specific active sites as well as gas diffusion channels,
doping porous SnO2 may have excellent performance in gas
sensoring. To obtain superior gas-sensing properties, one has to examine
the static response–recovery sensing, as reported elsewhere.11 Here, we investigated the statics response–recovery
sensing of Cu-doped nanocages (SC1-800H, SC2-800H) and Ni-doped popcornlike
SnO2 (SN-800H) toward 50 ppm formaldehyde in a temperature
range from 170 to 300 °C. It should be mentioned that SC1-800H
and SC2-800H devices have resistance higher than the detection line
(500 MΩ) at a relatively low temperature, thus no response signal
could be found, whereas SN-800H showed a response in the whole detection
temperature range. Besides, from the temperature-dependent curves
of sensitivity represented in Figure S10, one can see that SN-800H showed a superior performance to the other
two materials with the maximum response of 23.7 at 170 °C, whereas
SC1-800H and SC2-800H showed maximum responses of 12.8 at 200 °C
and 6.6 at 280 °C, respectively. In particular, SN-800H reduces
the best operation temperature of most SnO2 materials from
>30012,26,31 to 170 °C,
much lower than that of SC1-800H (200 °C) and SC2-800H (280 °C).
The higher response of SN-800H might be because of the following facts:
(i) Ni doping induced subsize leads to a relatively large surface
area, (ii) the surface-active O– verified by EPR,
and (iii) doping element of Ni is active in the gas-sensing performance.26,27,32,33Figure 8a compares
the response–recovery curve of porous SnO2 to different
concentrations of formaldehyde (5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 ppm).
The response amplitude sensors were increased with increasing the
concentration, indicating superior abilities to distinguish varied
concentration of toxic gas. In accordance with temperature-dependent
experiments, SN-800H sensor showed a higher response compared with
SC1-800H and SC2-800H. The Ni-doped popcornlike porous SnO2 sensor has a sensitivity of 52.8 to 200 ppm formaldehyde, which
is nearly 5 times higher than that of SC1-800H (10.5) and 6 times
than that of SC2-800H (8.6). Besides, the response and recovery curves
in Figure 8c also indicate
a very short response time of 5 s and a recovery time of 3 s to 50
ppm formaldehyde, faster than most SnO2 materials reported
previously.12,34 The superior performance of SN-800H
might be attributed to the unique popcorn shape and mesoporous structure,
which enabled the response gas to go through the pore easily. The
sensor sensitivity of SnO2 toward several other organic
gases (50 ppm) is also investigated at their optimum operation temperature.
As shown in Figure 8b, the responses of SN-800H sensor to formaldehyde are about 3, 8,
and 17 times than that to acetone, toluene, and benzene, respectively.
This indicates that SN-800H has a superior ability to distinguish
formaldehyde from other VOCs.

for SC2-800H). Catalytic effects of the as-synthesized metal-doped
porous SnO2 in (d) CO oxidation performance and (e) thermal
decomposition of AP (ammonium perchlorate).

2.3.2 Catalytic Applications in CO Oxidation and
AP Thermal Decomposition
Metal-doping porous materials could
also be used in other catalysis such as CO oxidation and AP thermal
decomposition benefiting from their increased active sites and special
surface/interfaces. First, we tested the catalysis activity toward
CO oxidation. As can be seen in Figure 8d, Cu-doped porous SnO2 showed an activity
superior to Ni doping. SC2-600H showed the optimal performance with
an onset conversion temperature of 180 °C and a total conversion
temperature of 300 °C, lower than those for Ni-doped SnO2 and most SnO2-based materials.6,35−37 Considering the higher surface area but lower CO
oxidation activity of Ni-doped porous SnO2, the influence
of surface area on CO catalysis could be excluded. In CO oxidation
reactions process, SnO2 usually acts as supporters to active
oxygen species, and the doping ions of Cu or Ni are active sites for
CO adsorption and activation. Thus, the superior activity of Cu-doped
porous SnO2 can be attributed to (i) the high activity
of copper species, as in previously reported studies38−40 and (ii) a strong interaction between doped copper ions and SnO2. Then, we used it in catalytic decomposition of AP, an oxidizing
agent in propellants. Previous investigations showed that metal elements
have played key roles in reducing the decomposition temperature.40 Metal-doped porous SnO2 is expected
to promote the catalytic reaction. TGA and DSC tests were employed
to show the heat-release process in AP decomposition, as presented
in Figure 8e. There
are three peaks in the DSC curves. The first endothermic peak without
mass loss at about 250 °C represents phase transformation from
orthorhombic to cubic AP. The other two exothermic peaks are referred
as the low-temperature decomposition and high-temperature decomposition
process of AP, respectively. It showed that all of these metal-doped
porous SnO2 possess the ability to reduce the decomposition
temperature (Figure 8e), especially Cu-doped compounds with about 80 °C decrease.
Lower surface area with higher performance indicates the existence
of abundant activity species. Cu species showed superior activity
in AP decomposition than Ni species in our previous study,24 and the accelerated electron transfer of Cu
species may be the major factor for enhanced performance. It appears
that metal-doped porous SnO2 is a multifunction material
for gas catalysis as well as solid catalysis.

3 Conclusions
We report on a new route to heteroatom-doping
of porous SnO2: Cu-doped nanocages and Ni-doped popcornlike
porous SnO2 through transformation of Sn-containing intermetallic
compounds.
The transformation processes involve calcination and a subsequent
acid-etching process. These composites with low-content metal-ion
doping (1–2% atomic ratio of metal to Sn) have diverse architectures
and are featured by lattice as well as surface-state regulation. Such
features enable metal-doped porous SnO2 to possess open-pore
channels with more in/out surface and catalytic active species. Investigation
on phase/shape-evolution process suggested that the fusion behavior
of SnxMy,
growth kinetics, and diffusion ability of MOx have crucial effects on the final architecture. It is demonstrated
that Sn-containing intermetallics could act as excellent precursors
to fabricate heteroatom-doping porous SnO2 with desired
nanostructures, necessary for multifunction performance such as gas
sensing, CO oxidation, and AP thermal decomposition. Because SnO2 is a prototype semiconductor with many counterparts, we expected
that these findings achieved here will put forward one’s ability
of synthesizing more ion-doping porous functional materials.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Sample Syntheses
All chemicals were
used as received without further purification. The sample syntheses
undergo two-step processes: (1) intermetallic precursor formation
and (2) transformation of the precursor to metal-doped porous SnO2. First, Sn-containing intermetallics such as Cu6Sn5, Cu3Sn, Sn–Ni and Sn–Co were
taken as the precursors. These precursors were prepared by a hydrothermal
method, just following the procedure we recently reported.24 Second, the precursors of Cu6Sn5, Cu3Sn, Sn–Ni, and Sn–Co were transformed
into a series of oxides named as SC1-800, SC2-800, SN-800, and SCo-800,
respectively, through an oxidization reaction under O2 atmosphere
at 800 °C for 2 h. Afterward, 30 mL of 0.3 M HNO3 aqueous
solution was added to form a mixed solution, which was transferred
to an autoclave with a Teflon liner and heated at 140 °C for
2 h. The sample after hydrothermal crystallization was centrifuged
and washed with abundant distilled water. Then, variations of porous
SnO2 (named as SC1-800H, SC2-800H, SN-800H, and SCo-800H)
were obtained after drying at 70 °C for precursors of Cu6Sn5, Cu3Sn, Sn–Ni, and Sn–Co,
respectively. Similar nomenclature was used for other samples obtained
at different calcination temperatures, as presented in Table S1.

4.2 Sample
Characterization
Sample structures
were identified by powder X-ray diffraction on a Rigaku D/Max 2550
diffractometer with a graphite monochromator, operating at 50 kV and
200 mA at room temperature, and using Cu Kα radiation (λ
= 1.5418 Å). Commercial Al powder serves as an internal standard
for peak positions determination mixed with samples evenly before
the measurement to exclude artificial factors. Morphologies of the
samples were further examined by field-emission SEM (Hitachi SU8020
electron microscope) and TEM (Philips/FEI Tecnai G2S TWIN microscope,
acceleration voltage of 200 kV). Samples for TEM were prepared by
dispersing a powder in ethanol and leaving a droplet of the suspension
on a copper (double-sided for magnetic sample) or molybdenum microscope
grid covered with perforated carbon. The selection of the microscope
grid depends on the elements in sample to eliminate the outside interference
in EDS and mapping measurement. Chemical compositions and valence
states of the samples were detected by XPS, a Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi
electron energy spectrometer using Al-Kα (1486.6 eV) as the
X-ray excitation source. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface areas of the samples were obtained by N2 adsorption/desorption
isotherm performed in an apparatus of Micromeritics ASAP 2020. The
UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples were recorded
on a PerkinElmer Lambda 20 UV–vis spectrometer.

The thermal
behaviors of the samples were performed on TGA and DSC in O2 or N2 atmosphere over a temperature range of 30–1000
°C (NETZSCH STA 449F3 thermal analyzer). The use of atmosphere
depends on the purposes. EPR measurements were performed using an
A300-10/12 X-band spectrometer (Bruker) operating at 9.84 GHz.

4.3 Catalytic Activity Test
4.3.1 Gas-Sensing Test
Gas sensor is
fabricated by coating viscous slurry of the sample onto a ceramic
tube (diameter 1 mm and length 4 mm) positioned with a pair of Au
electrodes and four Pt wires on both ends of the tube. A Ni–Cr
alloy coil in the tube was employed as a heater to control the operation
temperature. Gas-sensing tests were performed on a commercial CGS-8
Gas Sensing Measurement System (Beijing Elite Tech Company Limited).
Environmental air is used as both the reference gas and the diluting
gas. After the calculated target gas was injected into the test chamber
for about 30 min by a microsyringe, the sensor was put into the test
chamber. After the response completed, the sensor was removed to fresh
air for recovery. The sensor working temperature was adjusted by varying
the electric current. The sensor response is defined as S (the ratio of Ra to Rg), where Ra and Rg are the electrical resistance of the sensor in atmospheric
air and in target gas, respectively.

4.3.2 CO
Oxidation Test
Catalytic activity
of the as-prepared catalysts toward CO oxidation was evaluated in
a fixed-bed quartz microreactor using 50 mg of the catalyst. The feed
gas was composed of 1% CO and 20% O2 balanced by He at
a flow rate of 35 mL min–1 (roughly 80 000 h–1 GHSV). The reaction temperature was monitored by
a thermal couple in the middle of the quartz microreactor. The effluent
gas was detected by a gas chromatograph equipped with a TC-detector.
No products other than those resulted from CO (i.e., CO2) were observed under the applied reaction conditions. The conversion
of CO in the oxidation process was calculated from different concentrations
between inlet or outlet gases of CO.

4.3.3 AP
Thermal Decomposition Test
The
catalytic roles of the samples in the thermal decomposition of AP
were detected by TGA and DSC in N2 atmosphere over a temperature
range of 50–600 °C (NETZSCH STA 449F3 thermal analyzer).
