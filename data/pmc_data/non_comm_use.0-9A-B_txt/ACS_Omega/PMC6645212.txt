We report a highly functionalized
2-pyranone small molecule prepared
from tert-butyl diphenyl silyl ketene using an alkoxide
catalyst and thermally induced rearrangement. Treatment of the silyl
ketene with a substoichiometric amount of alkoxide led to the formation
of a trimer which was isolated and fully characterized; heating this
trimer in a 1,4-dioxane solution induced a thermal rearrangement,
yielding the product 2-pyranone. The isolated intermediate and product
are characterized by 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies,
mass spectrometry, and single crystal X-ray diffraction. A mechanism
for the thermally induced rearrangement is proposed based on 1H NMR studies, and a rate law is derived from the proposed
mechanism with steady-state approximation. This work illustrates a
route for the formation of highly functionalized and modifiable 2-pyranone
motifs with potential biological activity. The formation of the trimer,
and thus the functionalized 2-pyranone, is highly dependent on the
silyl substituents and alkoxide counterion and thus indicates the
intriguing reactivity of highly functionalized small molecules.

Introduction
2-Pyranones (Figure 1A) are prevalent
moieties in numerous natural products isolated from
plants, animals, marine organisms, bacteria, fungi, and insects. These
6-membered lactones exhibit a broad range of biological activities,
such as antifungal, antibiotic, cytotoxic, neurotoxic, and phytotoxic
properties.1 Typical 2-pyranones such as
triacetic acid and tetraacetic acid lactones can be used as precursors
for the synthesis of solanopyrones, pheromones, α-chymotrypsins,
and other biologically relevant compounds.2 For example, warfarin is a weak inhibitor of HIV protease3 and also interrupts HIV replication,4 whereas arisugacin A has been identified for
potential treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia,5 and pentahydro-3-aryl-1-oxopyrano-[4,3-b][1]benzopyrans inhibits tumor growth by up to 100%.6 As such, 2-pyranones and their substituted derivatives
are versatile units in the preparation of biologically relevant small
molecules.

A number of different approaches
have been used to synthesize functionalized
2-pyranones. Rossi and co-workers performed the iodolactonization
of 5-substituted (Z)-2-en-4-ynoic acids to obtain
a mixture of 6-substituted 5-iodo-2(2H)-pyranone
and (E)-5-(1-iodoylidene)-2(5H)-furanone.7 Alternatively, Louie and co-workers reported
the synthesis of highly functionalized 2-pyranones by the cycloaddition
of tethered alkynes and carbon dioxide using a nickel catalyst (Figure 1B).8 A three-step Baylis–Hillman-based reaction, including
lactonization and oxidation, was used by Kim and co-workers to synthesize
functionalized 2-pyranones from α,β-unsaturated esters
and ketones (Figure 1C).9 More recently, electrocyclization
has been exploited as the key step in the synthesis of 2-pyranones,
using transition metal complexes based on palladium,10−12 ruthenium,13,14 rhodium,15,16 or gold.17−19 These catalysts coordinate to the two reactive components,
alkyne and acrylate derivatives, and facilitate the direct formation
of substituted 2-pyranones at elevated temperatures (Figure 1D). Although these approaches
provide access to various 2-pyranones functionalized at the α,
β, γ, and/or δ positions, they require metal catalysts
and/or multiple steps with low atom efficiency.

Herein, we report
the synthesis of a highly functionalized 2-pyranone
bearing three unique silyl groups (compound 3) by a transition
metal-free thermal rearrangement approach (Figure 1E). tert-Butyl diphenyl
silyl (TBDPS) ketene is treated with an alkoxide, leading to the isolation
of a trimer (compound 2), which undergoes a thermal rearrangement
upon heating in dioxane. The chemical structures of compounds 2 and 3 are verified by 1H, 13C, 29Si, and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies,
as well as mass spectrometry and single crystal X-ray diffraction
(XRD). Mechanisms are proposed for the conversion of 1 to 2 and 2 to 3, as well
as the structures of intermediates and byproduct. Using kinetic data
obtained from 1H NMR studies, a rate law is derived from
the proposed mechanism with steady-state approximation. This work
provides insight into the reactivity of highly functionalized small
molecules in the preparation of 2-pyranone small molecules with potential
applications across a broad range of fields. Variation of reaction
conditions, specifically different silyl substituents and alkoxide
counterions, led to a complex mixture of products; thus, reactivity
is defined by subtle changes in reaction variables.

Results and Discussion
TBDPS ketene 1 was prepared from ethyl vinyl ether
following an established protocol and purified by distillation.20 The central carbon of silyl ketenes is electron-deficient
and is typically attacked by a nucleophile, such as an alcohol or
amine, to form an α-silyl ester21 or amide,22 respectively. In an effort
to understand the reactivity of silyl ketenes and produce well-defined
oligomers,23 we treated 1 with
lithium tert-butoxide (LiOtBu). Thus, the reaction of 1 with LiOtBu was expected to proceed by the nucleophilic addition
of tBuO– at the central
carbon to yield an enolate which could subsequently react with another
equivalent of 1. However, isolation of 2 indicated that this reaction did not occur, as no tert-butoxide group was present.

A proposed mechanism for the formation
of 2 from 1 is shown in Scheme 1. tBuO– likely
acted as a base, not a nucleophile, and deprotonated the terminal
carbon of 1, yielding an alkynolate which then served
as a nucleophile and added to the central carbon of a second equivalent
of 1. The resulting enolate then underwent C-alkylation
by addition to another equivalent of 1. Subsequent 6-exo-dig
cyclization, Brook rearrangement, and ring opening yielded the carboxylate
of 2, which was protonated with a mild acid and isolated.
The structure of 2 was verified by 1H, 13C, 29Si, heteronuclear single quantum coherence
(HSQC), heteronuclear multiple bond coherence (HMBC), and nuclear
Overhauser effect (NOESY) NMR spectroscopies, as well as electrospray
ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and Fourier-transform infrared
spectroscopy (FTIR) (Figure S2). Furthermore,
the structure was identified by single crystal XRD, as shown in Figure 2A. The crystal structure
reveals an intramolecular interaction [e.g., hydrogen bond (H-bond)]
between the carbonyl oxygen and the hydrogen on the γ-carbon,
forming a 6-membered ring and pre-organizing the molecule for subsequent
intramolecular reaction (vide infra). Whereas this conformation may
also result from a minimization of A1,3-strain, an intramolecular
H-bond is reflected in the HSQC NMR spectrum, where a singlet at 6.1
ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum correlates with a peak at 25.3
ppm in the 13C NMR spectrum (Figure S2D).

(B) compound 3. [Si] = SiPh2tBu.

Scheme 1 Proposed Mechanism for the Conversion
from 1 to 2
A solution of 2 in dioxane was heated to
70 °C
for 12 h, resulting in complete disappearance of 2 and
isolation of 3 in >75% yield. The chemical structure
of this highly functionalized 2-pyranone was determined by 1H, 13C, 29Si, HSQC, HMBC, and NOESY NMR, as
well as ESI-MS and FTIR (Figure S3). The
crystal structure shown in Figure 2B reveals that the planar 2-pyranone core bears three
distinct TBDPS groups: one TBDPS group attached to the β-position
through an oxygen, one TBDPS group directly attached to the γ-position
of the 2-pyranone core, and one TBDPS group attached through a methylene
unit at the δ-position. Thus, not only does the 2-pyranone 3 contain a high degree of functionalization, but it also
contains orthogonal silyl functionalities (silyl ether, aryl silane,
and alkyl silane).

The conversion of 2 to 3 was monitored
in situ using 1H NMR (50 °C in dioxane-d8). Figure 3A shows the 1H NMR spectra of the reaction before heating
(0 h), after 13 h at 50 °C (∼40% consumption of 2), and after 78 h at 50 °C (>95% of 2).
A signature peak of 2 is apparent at 4.50 ppm (black
box); full spectra are available in Figure S4. After 13 h, peaks attributed to product 3 are evident
at 5.03 and 2.50 ppm (red boxes), as well as two other species assigned
as intermediate 6 (peaks at 5.14 and 2.56 ppm, green
boxes) and byproduct 10 (peaks at 5.24 and 3.06 ppm,
blue boxes). Heating the reaction at 50 °C for a total of 78
h led to the disappearance of all peaks attributed to 2 and 6 and the presence of only product 3 and byproduct 10. Figure 3B shows the proposed structure of intermediate 6 and the HMBC NMR spectrum of the crude mixture after 13
h. Three-bond correlations from proton ① to carbon Cc, proton ② to carbon Cc, and proton ② to
carbon Cg were observed, as well as ②–Cb, ①–Ca and ①–Cd 2-bond couplings. Weak symmetrical peaks from protons ①
and ② are 1-bond coupling: ①–Ce and
②–Cf. The chemical structure of byproduct 10 is confirmed by 1H, 13C, 29Si, HSQC, and HMBC NMR, NOESY NMR, FTIR, and ESI-MS of the isolated
compound (Figure S5).

spectra after heating 2 in dioxane-d8 at 0, 13, and 78 h, with the chemical shifts
of starting material 2 (black box), product 3 (red boxes), intermediate 6 (green boxes), and byproduct 10 (blue boxes) identified; (B) 2D HMBC NMR spectrum of compound 2 heated to 50 °C in dioxane after 13 h with the structure
intermediate 6 shown and correlations illustrated.

Integration of 1H NMR
spectra over the course of the
reaction for the conversion of 2 to 3 was
used to observe the evolution of intermediate 6, byproduct 10, and product 3 (Figure 4). The concentration of 2 was
0.17 M at 0 h, and upon reaction, this concentration decreased (black
squares) and the concentration of intermediate 6, product 3, and byproduct 10 all increased (green circles,
red triangles, and blue inverted triangles, respectively). The concentration
of 6 increased for the first 32 h, reaching a maximum
concentration of 0.06 M and then decreased until 6 was
no longer observed (green circles). In the first 16 h of the reaction,
the concentration of product 3 and byproduct 10 increased at similar rates, but then diverged (red triangles and blue inverted triangles
for 3 and 10, respectively), when the concentration
of 10 plateaued and the concentration of 3 continued to increase.

squares), product 3 (red triangles), intermediate 6 (green circles), byproduct 10 (blue inverted
triangles), and 3 + 6 (purple diamond) against
time. Solid lines are kinetic data derived from steady state approximations.

On the basis of the 1H NMR studies, a mechanism is proposed
for the thermal rearrangement of 2 to 3 and 10, as shown in Scheme 2. In the formation of product 3, a 1,5-hydride
shift from carbon to oxygen first occurred to yield 4, as pre-organized by the conformation of 2, established
by 1H NMR and XRD (vide supra). Compound 4 then underwent a 6-exo-dig cyclization, followed by proton transfer
to form the 6-membered ring 5. Tautomerization of 5 yielded 6, the intermediate identified by NMR
spectroscopy; proton transfer readily transformed 6 to
product 3. Alternatively, byproduct 10 was
obtained upon rotation of 2 to access 7;
a subsequent 1,5-silyl shift yielded 8, replacing the
carbon–silicon bond with the more stable oxygen–silicon
bond (i.e., an intramolecular Brook rearrangement).24 Further tautomerization and Brook rearrangement then produced
byproduct 10, fully characterized in Figure S5. Using this proposed mechanism, the rate law for
the reaction was derived with steady state approximations;25,26 the concentration of 2, 10, and combined
concentration of 3 and 6 (Figure 3B, purple trace) gave good
agreement and the lines fits shown in Figure 4, with R values of 0.99,
0.99, and 0.96, respectively (see Appendix S3 for details).

Conclusions
In summary, we have reported the synthesis of a highly functionalized
2-pyranone small molecule using silyl ketene as a starting material,
alkoxide catalyst, and a thermally driven rearrangement. The starting
material, intermediate, product, and byproduct were thoroughly characterized
by various techniques, including 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopies, mass
spectrometry, and single crystal XRD. Mechanisms are proposed for
conversion of silyl ketene 1 to intermediate trimer 2 and for transformation of intermediate 2 to
product 3, as well as byproduct 10. Central
to this process are the identities of the silyl substituents, counterion,
and solvent, as an unidentifiable mixture of compounds is obtained
under other conditions (solvents, alkoxide counterion, silyl substituents,
see Supporting Information for details).
The kinetic profile of the thermally induced transformation was evaluated
using steady state approximations, supporting the proposed mechanism.
The 2-pyranone 3 is highly functionalized with reactive
handles that present opportunities for further modification; for example,
the silyl ether can be easily converted to an alcohol by treatment
with a base, and the alpha position can be brominated by treatment
with bromine (see Figures S7 and S8). Ongoing
work focuses on further establishing how to exploit the many unique
moieties for further modification of compound 3. This
work gives insight into the small molecule reactivity and provides
access to a 2-pyranone scaffold of interest for various biologically
active targets.
