A multifunctional
stimuli-responsive nanotheranostic agent provides
huge benefits in nanomedicine by combining both the diagnostic agent
and the drug molecule in a single system. This nanosystem is capable
of doing multiple tasks, for example, diagnosis, drug delivery, and
monitoring the therapeutic response. Hence, theranostic agents are
expected to play a significant role in personalized medicine. Herein,
a new class of nanotheranostic agents, Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg-Bn, is proposed for the effective delivery of camptothecin. This new
class of polymer has been functionalized with a superparamagnetic
norbornene cobalt unit for its use in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
The NMR one-dimensional image confirms the MRI capability of this
nanotheranostic agent. This is further modified with the poly(ethylene
glycol)–biotin moiety for biocompatibility and site-specificity.
The uniqueness of the design is confirmed by an in vitro study where
a greater uptake of the nanotheranostic agent is observed when compared
with free drugs. Hence, this new class of copolymer shows improved
potential as nanotheranostic agents in drug delivery.

Introduction
Progress in the development
of different chemotherapeutic agents
has produced an enormous opportunity to fight against cancer for the
past 2 decades.1 Anthracycline, alkaloid,
and inorganic metals are the front line compounds that are used in
chemotherapy.2 However, these small molecules
suffer from nonspecific binding and poor aqueous solubility that limit
their use in chemotherapy.3 In recent years,
nanocarriers have gained significant interest in nanomedicine.4 Nanocarriers, including micelles, vesicles, liposomes,
dendrimers, and polymer–drug conjugates, show promising activity
against various cancers because of their ability to reach specific
targeted sites.5−8

Among the different classes of chemotherapeutic agents, alkaloids
show significant promising activity toward various cancers.9 Camptothecin (CPT) is one of the alkaloid classes
of chemotherapeutic agents, which is well-known for its anticancer
activity toward various cancers via inhibiting the function of topoisomerase
I, an essential enzyme for protein synthesis in the transcription
process.9 This drug was first isolated
by Wall and Wani from the bark of Camptotheca acuminata in 1960, and the anticancer therapeutic activity was well-explored
by different research groups later on.10,11 However, despite
its promising anticancer activity toward various cancers, this small
molecule suffers from stability and aqueous solubility, which limit
its use in conventional cancer therapy in the biological system, for
example, through oral administration or intravenous injection.12 Several efforts have been made by different
research groups to address the problems associated with this small
molecule by making different functional derivatives, but none of them
show any promising activity because of the lack of site-specificity
that causes adverse side effects.13

Recently, a polymer-based nanotheranostic system has become an
emerging class of compounds that simultaneously integrates therapy
and diagnosis.14 Among different systems,
the use of a polymer-based drug-delivery vehicle has become prominent
over all other existing systems because of its pharmacokinetics and
biodistribution profile via the enhanced permeability and retention
(EPR) effect and the capability of maintaining the therapeutic concentration
over a longer period of time.15 Hence,
this theranostic medicine, which is capable of assistance in diagnosis
and monitoring the therapeutic response, plays a significant role
in the era of personalized medicine.

Among several diagnostic
techniques, magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) has gained significant attention because of its noninvasive
nature.16 This modern technique employs
MRI contrast agents that help change the relaxation behavior of the
targeted nuclei present in the tissues. Of the various relaxation
mechanisms, transverse relaxation is frequently employed to exploit
the advantages of contrast imaging.16 Toward
this goal, different literature studies have reported different types
of nanocarriers that carry the magnetic particles along with drug
molecules, but the noncovalent attachment or the encapsulation of
these inorganic magnetic particles leads to poor aqueous solubility,
which causes severe side effects. The poor aqueous solubility also
causes the lower contrast efficiency because the water molecules have
poor access to the magnetic core;17 hence,
there is a pressing need to have a covalent-attached magnetic nanocarrier
that can lead to a highly water-soluble nanotheranostic system.

To reduce the adverse cytotoxic effect of the chemotherapeutic
agent, researchers have been trying to modify the system by incorporating
different pendent functionalities into the prodrug system to make
it more site-specific.3,4,6 Basically,
target specificity deals with those kind of molecules that are required
for a cell to grow. Now, for the rapid growth of a cancerous cell,
high uptake value of some specific vitamins leads to the expression
of receptors on the cancer cell surface in high amounts, when compared
with a normal cell surface. Therefore, functionalization of this kind
of molecules (folate, biotin, fructose) can guide the chemotherapeutic
agent toward the cancer cells more site-specifically, which reduces
the side effects.18−20

In this work, we report the development of
a nanotheranostic agent
capable of sustained delivery of CPT and MRI because of the presence
of a superparamagnetic norbornene cobalt unit. The attachment of cobalt carbonyl to
the acetylene functionalized norbornene by Nicholas reaction at the
monomeric level.22 The NMR one-dimensional
(1D) image shows a very prominent effect on the transverse relaxation
of water molecules in micromolar concentration. This nanotheranostic
agent is further modified by poly(ethylene glycol)–biotin (PEG–biotin),
which helps the nanocarrier become site-specific.21 This highly water-soluble functional polymer nanocarrier
is expected to be useful in theranostics.

Results and Discussion
Toward the goal of making a norbornene-based theranostic prodrug,
three different monomers have been designed (Mono 1–3) and synthesized as shown in Scheme 1. The formation of all monomers was confirmed by 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy (Figures S1–S14). To synthesize Mono 1,
we first prepared the propargyl-attached norbornene (2), where the propargyl proton signal appeared. 1H NMR
spectrum at δ = 2.1 ppm in CDCl3 (Figure S3) and the formation of the product was further confirmed
by 13C NMR spectroscopy (Figure S4). The attachment of cobalt carbonyl to the propargyl moiety was
confirmed by NMR spectroscopy. In the 1H NMR spectrum,
the shifting of the signal at δ = 6.0 ppm from 2.1 ppm confirmed
the attachment of cobalt carbonyl to the terminal alkyne group (Figure 1a).22,26

Figure 1 (a,b) 1H NMR spectrum of Mono 1–2.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Mono 1–3
Reaction Scheme
The 13C NMR spectrum clearly supported the formation
of a product as a new peak arose at δ = 200 ppm corresponding
to Co–CO (Figure S5). The synthesis
of Mono 2 was a two-step process, starting from exo-norbornene anhydride. The anhydride was heated to reflux
in toluene with 11-amino undecanoic acid for 12 h to get 3 as a pure white powder (Figures S6 and S7). The S-camptothecin was then reacted with 3 by using N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide
(DCC) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). The crude product was purified
by column chromatography separation to get Mono 2 as
pure (Figures 1b and S8). Toward the site-specific theranostic system,
we synthesized norbornene functionalized with PEG–biotin (Mono 3). To attach the biotin moiety (Scheme 1), first, we prepared amine-terminated Nor-PEG
(7). For that, we synthesized boc-protected glycin (4) (Scheme 1). Boc anhydride was used to block the amine group of the glycin
(Figures S9 and S10). The boc-protected
glycin (1.05 equiv) was further reacted with PEG in tetrahydrofuran
(THF) (1 equiv) (Mn = 650 Da) in the presence
of DCC and DMAP, which gave the boc-protected amine-terminated PEG
(5). This molecule was precipitated in cold hexane three
times to get a white sticky material as product (5),
which was confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Figure S11). The free −OH group present
at the end of the PEG motif of compound 5 was functionalized
to exo-norbornene carboxylic acid by using DCC and
DMAP (Scheme 1). The
product was precipitated in cold hexane to get boc-protected Nor-PEG
amine (6) (Figure S12). The
deprotection of Nor-PEG-amine boc (6) was done by using
trifluoroacetyl in dichloromethane (DCM). The formation of product
(7) was confirmed by the disappearance of the characteristics
of boc methyl proton at δ = 1.39 ppm peak (Figure S13). After the successful synthesis of the amine-terminated
Nor-PEG (7), biotin was reacted to it by using DCC and
DMAP (Scheme 1) to
get Nor-PEG-Btn (Mono 3). The formation
of the product was characterized by an 1H NMR spectrum
(Figure S14), where the entire characteristic
peaks appeared. MALDI-TOF analysis further supported the formation
of the product (Figure S18).

After
the successful synthesis of all monomers (Mono 1–3), their polymerization conditions were explored. A series of homopolymers
were produced by using Grubbs third-generation catalyst (G-3) with
different feed ratios to evaluate the livingness of all monomers24 (Figure 2). It was observed that the polymerizations were well-controlled
(Figures 2 and S22), resulting in a narrow polydispersity index
(PDI), with a good yield (70–80%). After establishing the homopolymerization
conditions for all monomers, triblock copolymerization was carried
out by using Grubbs’ third generation catalyst (G-3) at room
temperature in an anhydrous DCM solvent by the sequential addition
of Mono 1–3 (Figure 3a,b). The polymerization was monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The molecular weights of macro initiator
1 (Mn = 6000, PDI = 1.03), macro initiator 2 (Mn = 21 000,
PDI = 1.12), and the final triblock copolymer (Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg-Bn, Mn = 39 000, PDI = 1.35) were
measured in gel permeation chromatography (GPC) by using polymethyl
methacrylate standards (Figure 3c). The shifting of GPC traces clearly indicated the formation
of triblock copolymer (Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg-Bn) (Figure 3c). The formation of the copolymer
was confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Figure S19).

initiator 2 (Nor-Cob-Cpt)Mn =
22 000 Da (PDI = 1.12) (n = 19), and final
triblock copolymer (Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg-Bn)Mn = 39000 Da, (PDI = 1.35) (p = 15).

The final polymer was highly water
soluble. The attachment of cobalt
carbonyl to the terminal alkyne group was confirmed by IR spectrum
(Figure S17). The IR spectrum of 2 showed a stretching frequency around 2126 cm–1 corresponding to the acetylene moiety, which completely disappeared,
and three new bands were observed at 2097, 2056, and 2020 cm–1 corresponding to the metal-carbonyl group22 (Figure S17). After confirming the formation
of Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg-Bn, its thermal stability was measured
by using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Figure S16). TGA of Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg-Bn was performed at
a heating rate of 10 °C/min under a nitrogen atmosphere. The
first degradation point was observed at 220 °C (Figure S16). It was also observed that around 25% of degradation
clearly confirmed the degradation of the cobalt unit from the polymeric
backbone, which was in agreement with the previously reported literature28 and also confirmed the cobalt attachment to
the polymer. Because of the complex architectural amphiphilicity of
the nanotheranostic agent, it is expected that this will form a self-assembled
aggregated structure in the polar aqueous solvent, where the hydrophobic
unit cobalt and the drug will be inside of the core, whereas PEG will
form the shell; therefore, dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis
was done in water to measure the size of the nanoaggregates.27,29,30,32,33 The size (diameter)
of the aggregates was found to be around 120 nm with 0.325 PDI (Figure 4a). Thereafter, the
morphology of the aggregate was checked by a scanning electron microscope.
Because of the presence of Co2+ inside of the nanotheranostic
agent, even without any contrast agent, the aggregates appeared dark
under the electron beam (Figure 4b). The EDX experiment showed that all particular spherical
micelles contained the cobalt unit (Figure 4b), which proves our hypothesis. Thereafter,
we checked the sustained release capability of CPT from Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg-Bn nanotheranostic agent in acidic pH 5.2. The drug release kinetics
of Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg-Bn in 5% acetonitrile in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS, pH values 7.4 and 5.2) at room temperature were analyzed
at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm at different time intervals.38

Figure 4 (a) DLS study of Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg-Bn, (b) SEM
and EDX
analysis of Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg-Bn, and (c) drug release study
of Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg-Bn in pH 7.4 and 5.2.

At pH 5.2, around 72% of the drug was released,
whereas at pH 7.4,
the percentage of released drug was less than 5 (Figure 4c), which proved the stability
of the nanocarrier (Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg-Bn) under physiological
conditions.39,40

Next, to prove the theranostic
capability of the nanocarrier, an
NMR 1D experiment of the nanocarrier (Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg-Bn) was performed. All experiments were performed using a 500 MHz Avance-III
Bruker spectrometer equipped with a linear gradient amplifier parallel
to the static magnetic field.31 Three sample
solutions were prepared for a comparative study. A 1:5 mixture of
H2O and D2O in v/v ratio was used as the common
solvent for all three sample solutions. The contrast agent was added
to the solvent to obtain concentrations of 0, 0.1, and 0.5 mM. The
first solution (without any contrast agent, i.e., the 0 mM solution)
was used as a reference. The sample solutions were poured in 5 mm
quartz NMR tubes to obtain the MRI images.

The pulse sequence
used to establish the efficiency of the contrast
agent is a spin-echo-based sequence.25 The
sequence employs an acquisition under a linear gradient strength of
10 g/cm to obtain a T2-weighted 1D image
of the sample. Figure 5a,b depict the pictorial representation of the pulse sequence and
the Fourier spectrum. The echo period in the pulse sequence has been
varied from 10 to 100 ms in steps to 10 ms. The Fourier transform
of the acquired free induction decay collected under gradient yields
a T2-weighted 1D image of the sample solution
for various echo periods owing to the spatial encoding. A series of
spectra indicates the rapidity with which the signal decreases. For
a given concentration, the resulting spectra are plotted in a contour
diagram for a spatial extension of 2 mm of the sample. All processing
was performed using MATLAB software. The intensity of the acquired
signal has been plotted in a descending color-scale of red to blue,
where blue indicates a stronger signal compared with that of red (Figure 5c).

Figure 5 (a,b) Pictorial representation
of the pulse sequence and the Fourier
spectrum. (c) Contour diagram in any of the subplot shows how quickly
the signal decays from high intensity (red) to low intensity (blue).

A contour diagram in any of the
subplot of Figure 5c shows how quickly the signal decays from
high intensity (red) to low intensity (blue). For the blank solution
(0 mM), the signal nearly vanishes near 80 ms (the beginning of blue
region), whereas the same behavior is observed at 50 and 30 ms for
the 0.1 and 0.5 mM solutions, respectively (Figure 5c). Thus, the contour diagram clearly indicates
that the decay of the acquired signal strongly depends on the concentration
of the nanotheranostic agent.

After confirming the MRI capability
of the nanotheranostic agent (Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg-Bn), experiments
at the cellular level were
performed and compared with free CPT and the theranostic
agent without being modified with biotin (Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg) (Scheme S2). For the in vitro cytotoxicity
study, HeLa wt cells (human cervical cancer cell line) were maintained
in minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillium
(100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100 μg/mL). It was incubated at
37 °C in a 5% CO2 environment according to American
Type Culture Collection recommendations. Cells were seeded in 96-well
plates at a density of 1 × 104 cells per well and
grown for 24 h.

Cells were exposed with serial dilutions of
various drug concentrations
in the media (25–500 μg/mL) of Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg-Bn and Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg at 37 °C. The cytotoxicity
of the nanoaggregates Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg and free CPT on HeLa wt cells were also assessed by the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay (5 mg/mL) in PBS. The free
CPT was dissolved in 0.01% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in media.
It is well-documented that because of the poor solubility of CPT,
it is difficult to be applied in chemotherapy.12 Although different analogues of CPT have been synthesized
by different research groups, cytotoxicity has been tested by dissolving
the moieties exclusively in DMSO.34 However,
DMSO by itself is toxic toward various cell lines and thus to living
systems.37 Because of the hurdles, the
PEG-modified CPT has only reached clinical trials.12,35,36 Thus, testing the therapeutic activity of
a drug by dissolving it in DMSO alone will not provide the actual
therapeutic benefits. Because HeLa wt cell lines are used to test
the cytotoxicity of both the controls (free CPT and the nanocarriers), an already reported quantity of 0.01% DMSO
was used, as it is not toxic to the cells at this quantity.37 Because of the presence of PEG, our nanocarrier
is soluble in biological media. However, to show a more pronounced
effect of the nanocarrier in comparison with the free CPT, the cytotoxicity experiment for CPT was carried out in 0.01% DMSO
in media, whereas for the nanocarrier, the experiment was exclusively
carried out in biological media (no DMSO). This can correlate the
solubility factor as a nominal amount of DMSO was added and hence
can provide insight into the usefulness of the aqueous solubility
of chemotherapeutic agents. Even the water-soluble CPT analogue topotecan·HCl
has been given approval for the treatment of cervical cancer.41

The incubation time for each was 24 h. Although the cytotoxicity experiment for CPT
was done in 0.01% DMSO in media, free CPT was still suffering
from poor solubility. Hence, the undissolved part was filtered, and in vitro
studies were done with the remaining solution. The concentration of free CPT was calculated from the amount of CPT soluble in
the stock solution, and different concentrations of CPT solutions
were prepared from the stock solution to perform the MTT assay. Further,
to understand the cytotoxic nature of biotin-modified nanocarrier
(Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg-Bn) because of the enhanced internalization
through receptor-mediated endocytosis, the PEG modified nanocarrier
(Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg) was used as a control molecule to compare
the effects (Scheme S2).

A fresh
20 μL solution of MTT was added to each
well, followed by incubation for 4 h in 5% CO2 at 37 °C.
The medium in each well was removed, and 100 μL of DMSO was
added to each well and agitated for 15 min. The absorbance of the
purple solution was measured at 525 nm by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent
(immunoadsorbant) assay (ELISA) plate reader (BioTek Instrument—ELx
800). The killing efficiency was prominent in the case of Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg-Bn compared with free CPT and Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg (Figure 6a,b). This
can be attributed to the mechanism of receptor-mediated endocytosis,
as Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg-Bn can be easily internalized by the
cancer cell through a biotin receptor, which is missing in the case
of Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg and free CPT. In addition,
the higher uptake of Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg by the cancer cells
in comparison with the free CPT can be attributed to
the solubility factor.

Figure 6 (a) Comparative cell viability assay of Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg, Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg-Bn, and (b) free CPT (partially
soluble in 0.01% DMSO in media) on HeLa wt cell lines.

To further investigate the biotin-assisted internalization,
cellular
uptake studies of Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg-Bn were explored and
compared with Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg and free CPT (Figure 7). Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg-Bn could rapidly enter owing to the incorporated
biotin group, which showed an excellent cell-penetrating activity
to promote cell internalization compared with Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg (Figure 7), whereas free CPT suffering from aqueous solubility could not show
a pronounced effect.

Figure 7 Comparative cellular uptake of free CPT (partially
soluble
in 0.01% DMSO in media) and Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg and Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg-Bn nanocarriers on HeLa wt cell lines.

This was further confirmed by
flow cytometry analysis, which shows
about a 2 times higher uptake of nanocarriers (Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg-Bn) in HeLa wt cell lines compared with Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg at the same concentration (Figure 8), whereas for free CPT, the mean intensity
value is lower than that of both the nanocarriers Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg-Bn and Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg, which can be attributed to the
solubility factor (Figure 8).

Figure 8 Flow cytometry analysis of free CPT and Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg and Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg-Bn nanocarriers on HeLa wt cell
lines.

The lower uptake of Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg to the cancer cell
lines (HeLa wt) compared with Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg-Bn can be
attributed to the presence of a receptor on the cancer cell surface
and not on the normal cell surface and that makes our system site-specific
as the nanocarrier follows the receptor-mediated endocytosis (Figure 9).3 However, the free CPT, which is suffering
from the solubility issues, shows the lowest uptake compared with
nanocarriers (Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg-Bn and Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg) (Figure 8).

Conclusions
This paper describes
the synthesis of a unique cell-internalizable
stimuli-responsive nanotheranostic agent for the purpose of MRI and
drug-delivery application. The well-shielded therapeutic agent CPT
into the polymeric micelle shows excellent triggered release of CPT
in response to intracellular pH that enhances the therapeutic efficacy
as well as reduces the cytotoxic effect. The covalently bound paramagnetic
cobalt block stabilized inside the core of the micelle shows excellent T2 relaxation properties in very low concentration.
Further, owing to the presence of the biotin moiety, the nanothernostic
agent shows a higher cellular uptake compared with free CPT and Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg, which is the crucial characteristic
of a nanotheranostic agent in site-specific cancer therapy. Thus,
this molecule is expected to play a crucial role in theranostics.

Preparation of Grubbs’ Third Generation Catalyst
Freshly prepared Grubbs’ third generation catalyst23 was used for all polymerization reactions. The
desired amount of Grubbs’ second generation catalyst (G-2)
was placed in a glass vial. To this, 2-bromopyridine was added and
stirred for 2 min. The immediate green coloration of the reaction
mixture confirmed the formation of the catalyst. The product was precipitated
from pentane. The whole reaction was carried out inside of the glove
box under the nitrogen atmosphere.

Polymerization Procedure
Polymerization was carried
out by following previously reported literature.21−23 In general,
a desired amount of Grubbs’ third generation catalyst was added
to each vial containing three monomers (Mono 1–3). Polymerization was carried out inside of the glove box under the
nitrogen atmosphere.

The catalyst (3.5 mg) was transferred to
the vial containing Mono 1 (30 mg, 0.057 mmol) via a
syringe. The reaction was allowed to stir for 10 min to complete polymerization.
An aliquot of the sample was quenched with ethyl vinyl ether, precipitated
in pentane, and taken for GPC analysis. GPC was done in THF (flow
rate = 1 mL/min). The molecular weight of macro initiator 1
(Nor-Cob) was measured as Mn =
6000 Da (PDI = 1.04) by using polymethyl methacrylate standard. Then,
the second monomer (Mono 2) (115 mg, 0.17 mmol) was added
to the reaction vial after dissolving it in a minimum quantity of
anhydrous CH2Cl2. The reaction mixture was stirred
for 8 h, and an aliquot was taken for GPC analysis. The molecular
weight of macro initiator 2 (Nor-Cob-Cpt) was measured
to be Mn = 18 000 Da (PDI = 1.13)
by using polymethyl methacrylate standard. Finally, Mono 3 (1.5 g, 1.45 mmol) was added to the reaction vial and stirred until
polymerization was completed. Then, the reaction mixture was quenched
with ethyl vinyl ether (1 mL). An aliquot was taken for GPC analysis,
and the remaining product was precipitated from pentane, dissolved
again in THF, passed through neutral alumina to remove the catalyst,
and precipitated again from pentane to get a pure triblock copolymer
(Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg-Bn). The molecular weight of the final
triblock copolymer was measured as Mn =
39 000 Da, PDI = 1.34 (Figure 3c). The formation of the copolymer (Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg-Bn) was further confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Figure S19). After successful synthesis of Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg-Bn, the THF solution of the copolymer was passed through a neutral
alumina column, and the precipitation was done in diethyl ether three
times. Then, the resulting polymer (Pnr-Cbt-Cpt-Pg-Bn) was dialyzed against the THF/water (3:1) mixture for 1 day by using
a dialysis membrane (cut off Mn = 3500
Da).
