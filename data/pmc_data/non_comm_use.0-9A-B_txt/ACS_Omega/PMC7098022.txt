Photothermal therapy
(PTT) in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II,
1000–1350 nm) has presented great superiority in cancer treatment
recently. However, it is generally limited to a few photothermal agents
and most of them often suffer from intricate design and complicated
synthesis. Herein, by subtly extracting nanoparticles from ancient
ink (AINPs), a versatile AINP dispersion with definite ingredients,
good biosafety, and excellent photothermal effect in the NIR-II window
was obtained. In vivo trials demonstrated that the obtained AINP dispersion
provides a promising alternative for tumor sentinel lymph node (SLN)
mapping. Besides, under the guidance of photoacoustic imaging, the
metastatic SLNs could be accurately eliminated by NIR-II laser irradiation.
The preliminary biosafety of AINP dispersion has also been systematically
confirmed. Therefore, we believe this work would provide a green and
effective strategy for PTT of tumor in the NIR-II window.

Introduction
Photothermal therapy
(PTT), which utilizes focused hyperthermia
by photothermal agents (PTAs) under near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation,
is a clinically promising strategy in tumor treatments.1−3 Different from traditional cancer treatments, PTT exhibits numerous
advantages including simple procedures, noninvasive, and high spatiotemporal
selectivity.4,5 In the past decade, a large number
of different nanomaterials have been investigated as PTAs for PTT
of cancer.6−13 However, most of the previous work primarily focused on PTT in the
first NIR window (NIR-I, 700–950 nm), which often suffered
from the limited penetration depth.

In comparison with the NIR-I
window, the second NIR window (NIR-II,
1000–1350 nm) is more feasible for clinical PTT due to the
deeper tissue penetration and larger maximum permissible exposure
(MPE) dose to human skin (0.33 W/cm2 for 808 nm laser while
1 W/cm2 for 1064 nm laser).14−16 Therefore, massive efforts
have been devoted to exploring novel PTAs for NIR-II PTT recently.17−24 For example, by controlling the interfaces of noble metal and adjusting
the coupling effect of localized surface plasmon resonance, Jiang
et al. successfully constructed a dual plasmonic Au–Cu9S5 hybrid nanostructure, which exhibited strong
absorbance during the NIR-II region.17 Shi
et al. also developed a liquid exfoliation method and prepared a two-dimensional
niobium carbide for PTT of cancer in both the NIR-I and the NIR-II
window.23 Very recently, some organic molecules
or semiconducting polymers composed of electron-delocalized π-conjugated
structures have also demonstrated great potential in the NIR-II PTT
of cancer.25−29 However, for future clinical translation, these artificial nanomaterials
often suffer from elaborate design and complicated synthesis, which
limit their industrial development. From this point, some natural
nanomaterials such as humic acid,30 human
hair,31 endogenous biliverdin,32 and cuttlefish ink33 with easy synthetic procedures, good biocompatibility, and excellent
therapeutic efficiency may become new candidate agents for future
clinical applications, although their PTT still presented a poor efficiency
in the NIR-II window.

Ancient ink, as a glorious calligraphy
material derived from the
incomplete combustion of natural plant, has been used for centuries
and played an important role in the creation of human civilization.34 The benefits of the ancient ink such as the
nanosized structure, carbon element composition, and its formation
mechanism of resonance-stabilized hydrocarbonradical chain reactions
were gradually revealed by the efforts of contemporary scientists.35,36 It subsequently opens a promising prospect for diverse applications
including flexible batteries,37 solar energy
conversion,38 and three-dimensional electrodes.39 Besides, in many world-renowned medical books,
such as Compendium of Materia Medica,34 ancient ink was ever recorded as a nontoxic
medicinal herb for hemostasis, which convincingly demonstrates that
it possesses excellent biocompatibility. However, further applications
of ancient ink for modern biomedicine, especially for PTT of cancer
in the NIR-II window, have not yet been explored to the best of our
knowledge.35

Herein, inspired by
our tentative discovery that ancient ink manifested
a distinct wide absorption band even in the NIR-II region like most
other PTAs, a new conceptual biomedical application of ancient ink
for NIR-II PTT of cancer was thus proposed. As shown in Scheme 1, the ancient ink nanoparticles
(AINPs) were first extracted using the traditional ink production
process and then modified with poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP), a Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) approved pharmaceutical adjuvant,40 to obtain the final AINP dispersion through
simple hydrothermal treatment. Interestingly, the AINP dispersion
that we obtained presents certain ingredients (only ink nanoparticles
and PVP), good biocompatibility, and excellent photothermal performance
in the NIR-II window. More importantly, it proposes a very promising
strategy for sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping and NIR-II PTT of tumors
in future clinical practice and promotes further exploration of biomedical
applications of ancient ink.

Ancient Ink (AINPs) for Cancer
Sentinel Lymph Node (SLN) Mapping and Photothermal Therapy (PTT) in
the Second Near-Infrared (NIR-II) Window
As revealed by photoacoustic
(PA) imaging, AINP dispersion after being injected to the primary
tumor on the right hind foot pad could effectually transfer into the
SLNs via the lymphatic vessels. NIR-II PTT was then implemented by
exposing SLNs to a 1064 nm laser.

Results and Discussion
Preparation
and Characterization of AINP Dispersion
The raw AINPs prepared
by incomplete combustion of pinewood or tung
oil in kiln are generally of soot form with a deep black color (Scheme 1).34 To explore the elemental constituents of AINPs, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) was first conducted. As confirmed in Figure 1a, the AINPs mainly consisted
of carbon and oxygen elements, and the carbon element dominated the
constituents with up to 90.5%. From the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern
(Figure 1b), it revealed
a similar broad peak at ≈25°, which was consistent with
the carbon crystal plane (002), which was a typical characteristic
of graphitic carbon materials.8,37 Then, a Raman spectroscope,
a general instrument to study the carbonaceous materials, was subsequently
used to investigate its structural feature. As shown in Figure 1c, the D band (∼1300
cm–1) and G band (∼1600 cm–1) peaks were clearly observed, which confirmed the constituents of
both amorphous carbon and graphene sheet-like structure in AINPs.41 From the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectrum (Figure S1), it also indicates
the presence of −OH (3350–3570 cm–1), C–H (2835 and 2916 cm–1), C=O
(1632 cm–1), and C–O–C (1091 cm–1) functional groups on the surface of AINPs. To explore
the nanoparticle morphology and features of AINPs, scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) was then carried out. SEM images (Figure 1d) revealed a morphology in
good accord with our desired nanosized structure, and the corresponding
element-mapping images showed a uniform distribution of elements C
(Figure 1e) and O (Figure 1f) in AINPs. However,
the severe aggregation, as shown in SEM images (Figure 1d), and the poor water dispersibility of
AINPs (Figure 1g) limited
their further applications, especially in biological medicine.42

To solve this problem, PVP, a widely used stabilizer
approved by
the FDA was then used.40 AINP dispersion
was obtained by simple sonication and subsequent hydrothermal treatment
of AINPs and PVP. Compared with the original AINPs, the obtained AINP
dispersion by PVP modification was very stable in various physiological
environments. No aggregation was observed even after storage for 3
days in water, phosphate buffer saline (PBS), and Roswell Park Memorial
Institute (RPMI) 1640 (Figure 1g). From the transmission electron microscope (TEM) image,
we could observe that the AINP dispersion primarily consists of homogeneous
ink nanoparticles (Figure 1h). It further demonstrated that the AINPs after PVP modification
presented good dispersibility in water with a hydrodynamic diameter
of about 150 nm according to dynamic light scattering (DLS) (Figure 2i). Next, the NIR
absorption ability of AINPs was investigated using a UV–vis–NIR
spectrometer. From Figure 2a, the AINPs presented a distinct wide absorption band in
the NIR region similar to other carbon nanomaterials7−9 and still maintained intense absorption even in the NIR-II window
(1000–1350 nm). Considering the higher MPE power density and
the deeper tissue penetration of the NIR-II window than the traditional
NIR-I window,14−16 a 1064 nm laser was then selected to investigate
its photothermal property. As shown in Figure 2b, the temperature of AINP dispersion increased
obviously with the increasing concentration of AINPs when irradiated
under a 1064 nm laser using the MPE power density (1 W/cm2). For example, the temperature could reach promptly from 25 to 70.5
°C (100 μg/mL) after continuous irradiation for 5 min,
which was much higher than that of the 808 nm laser if irradiated
under its corresponding MPE power density (0.33 W/cm2)
(Figure 2c). The temperature
change of AINP dispersion under different laser irradiations at power
densities of 0.33 and 1 W/cm2 was also conducted, which
indicated that AINPs possessed a parallel photothermal effect under
808 or 1064 nm laser irradiation using the same power density (Figure S2). To evaluate the photothermal stability
of AINPs, the temperature profiles of AINP dispersion were recorded
during circular heating and cooling processes. No distinct decrease
was observed during the whole successive cycle experiment (Figure S3). In the meantime, insignificant variation
was also manifested in the UV–vis–NIR spectra after
repeated irradiation (Figure S4). Using
the reported method,43 the photothermal
conversion efficiency of AINPs in 1064 nm was further calculated to
be 48% (Figure S5), which was superior
to many PTAs that are currently used in the NIR-II window (Table S1). Besides the desired physicochemical
properties and excellent photothermal performance, long-term stability
is also a highly important property when it comes to real clinical
application. Interestingly, we found that the UV–vis–NIR
spectral property of AINPs was quite stable during the experiment
(Figure S6). It barely exhibited a change
in the photothermal effect of AINPs even when stored for 90 days (Figure 2d), demonstrating
that AINPs maintained a stable photothermal performance. The ζ-potential
(Figure 2e) and the
hydrodynamic diameter (Figure 2f) of AINP dispersion were also stable during the storage
time, which were crucial prerequisites for clinical storage. To sum
up, the prominent photothermal performance in the NIR-II window as
well as the stable physicochemical properties of AINP dispersion together
make it a promising PTA candidate for future cancer treatment.

Cytotoxicity and In Vitro Photothermal Therapy
According
to the traditional literature on medicine, ancient ink was not only
used in calligraphy but was also a good medicinal herb. That ancient
ink was pungent and warm, nontoxic, and mainly used in the treatment
of hemostasis was recorded in Compendium of Materia Medica, a world influential traditional medical book.34 Hence, we speculated that the AINP dispersion (only consists
of ink nanoparticles and FDA approved PVP) that we obtained would
possess low toxicity and good biocompatibility. To confirm our assumption,
normal cells (HEK-293T cells) and cancerous cells (CT-26 cells) were
selected to verify the safety of AINP dispersion by cell counting
kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. As shown in Figure 3a, even when the AINP concentration was up
to 400 μg/mL, both HEK-293T cells and CT-26 cells still maintained
over 90% cell viabilities after 24 h incubation. These consequences
confirmed the negligible cytotoxicity and good biocompatibility of
the obtained AINP dispersion. Next, we evaluated the PTT therapeutic
efficacy of AINP dispersion in vitro on CT-26 cells. As shown in Figure 3b, the cells treated
with various concentrations of AINPs demonstrated a distinct concentration-dependent
cell viability decrease after 1064 nm laser irradiation (1 W/cm2, 5 min). For instance, the cell viability decreased over
87.4% in AINPs + 1064 nm laser group when the concentration of AINPs
increased to 100 μg/mL, while it decreased only 15.4% in the
same concentration under irradiation for 5 min by 808 nm laser with
its corresponding MPE power density (0.33 W/cm2). This
considerable difference on cell viability decrease could be primarily
ascribed to the higher MPE power density of the NIR-II window than
the traditional NIR-I window. For a more visual representation of
PTT therapeutic efficacy, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM)
imaging with calcein acetoxymethyl ester (calcein-AM, labeling living
cells with green fluorescence) and propidium iodide (PI, labeling
dead cells with red fluorescence) staining were also carried out.
From the CLSM images (Figure 3c), the results showed that CT-26 cells in AINPs + 1064 nm
laser group presented strong red fluorescence, which indicated that
the AINPs could efficiently kill tumor cells under 1064 nm laser exposure.
However, cells in the control group, 1064 nm laser group, AINP group,
and AINPs + 808 nm laser group presented intense green fluorescence,
which demonstrated that a large proportion of cells were still alive.
Meanwhile, flow cytometry was also conducted at each treatment group
for quantitative analysis of cell apoptosis. As shown in Figure 3d, the apoptosis
rate of cells in AINPs + 1064 nm laser group could reach up to 99.4%,
indicating that almost all of the cell death was induced via AINP-mediated
photothermal ablation. In conclusion, all of these in vitro cell experiments
consistently indicated that the AINP dispersion that we obtained possessed
ignorable cytotoxicity and was able to effectively kill cancer cells
by its prominent photothermal ability, especially in the NIR-II window.

Photoacoustic (PA) Imaging
of Tumor Sentinel Lymph Nodes
As we all know, metastasis
has become the biggest challenge in cancer
diagnosis and treatment and is also the leading cause of cancer mortality
in clinics.44 During the early stage of
metastasis, the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) near the primary tumor
are generally the major targets of tumor cells through the lymphatic
vessel.45 Hence, it is very clinically
significant to recognize the locations of SLNs and then remove them
selectively to prevent further metastasis. However, the accurate and
rapid location of SLNs with low tissue damage is challenging in current
clinical practice and limited to few strategies such as blue dye staining,
radio-colloid tracers, or just their simple combination.46

PA imaging has aroused great interest
in the last few years, as promising imaging technology.1,47 It is based on the thermoelastic expansion generated by the PA imaging
contrast agent and subsequent acoustic wave detection.47 Compared with conventional computed tomography
(CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), PA imaging integrates deep
penetration, simple operation, and high sensitivity, which presents
great superiority in SLN mapping.47,48 Interestingly,
we found that most PTAs were also latent PA imaging contrast agents
on account of the strong absorption in the NIR window.8,9 As shown in Figure 4a, the in vitro PA imaging capacity of AINP dispersion was evaluated,
and the PA signal enhanced distinctly with the increasing concentration
of AINPs (Figure 4b).
In addition, it was reported that nanoscale agents after being injected
into the primary tumor could effectually migrate into the SLNs along
the lymphatic vessels.49 Therefore, AINP
dispersion was supposed to be an excellent nanoprobe to locate the
SLNs through PA imaging. In the following trials, Balb/c mice were
inoculated with CT-26 cancer cells on the hind foot pad and allowed
to develop both the primary tumors and metastatic tumors in SLNs.
Subsequently, the primary tumors of these mice were injected with
AINP dispersion. At the same time, the PA signals in the SLN region
were recorded at various points of time (0, 10, 30, 60, 120, and 180
min) under a PA imaging scanner. As shown in Figure 4c, the PA signals of the SLN region gradually
showed up at 10 min post the injection of AINP dispersion and exhibited
increased PA signals over time, indicating the successful translocation
of the injected AINPs from the primary tumor to the SLNs. The PA signal
intensity in the SLN region reached its highest level at around 120
min after the primary tumors were injected with AINP dispersion. Meanwhile,
the quantification value of the PA signal at the SLN region was also
obtained. For instance, the PA intensity of the SLN region before
and after being injected into the primary tumors for 120 min was calculated
as 0.25 ± 0.03 and 2.57 ± 0.23, respectively (Figure 4d). After exposed by slight
anatomy, the SLNs were also distinguished clearly from the surrounding
tissues due to the transference and retention of dark black AINPs
(Figure S7). In conclusion, the high spatial
resolution of PA imaging and the subsequent black staining of SLNs
offered by the AINP dispersion were confirmed to be a valid and accurate
strategy for tumor SLNs mapping in future clinical practice.

dispersion in vitro at various excitation wavelengths. (b) Linear

being exposed to laser irradiation (1 W/cm2 for 1064 nm
and 0.33 W/cm2 for 808 nm) for 10 min.

PA Imaging-Guided NIR-II PTT of Tumor SLNs
Next, PA
imaging was applied to guide the PTT of SLN metastasis in colorectal
tumor. The primary tumor of mice growing on the hind foot pad was
first injected with a certain amount of AINP dispersion (5 mg/mL,
50 μL). At 120 min post injection, the SLNs in the popliteal
site were exposed continuously to a 1064 nm laser for 10 min under
its MPE power density (1 W/cm2). At the same time, an infrared
imaging device was also used to record the temperature change in real
time. As observed in Figure 4e, the regional temperature of SLNs in AINPs + 1064 nm laser
group could increase quickly from 30.6 to 51.0 °C in 5 min and
continued to maintain this hyperthermia for the remaining time, which
was sufficient to ablate the cancer tissues.50 Nevertheless, the temperature in the PBS group after the same laser
power irradiation presented negligible temperature variation and the
temperature only reached to 35.0 °C, which would hardly cause
any damage to the tumor cells.51 To further
confirm the superiority of PTT in the NIR-II window, the SLNs after
intratumor injection of AINP dispersion were also exposed to an 808
nm laser with its corresponding MPE power density (0.33 W/cm2). As shown in Figure 4e, the temperature of the SLN region only increases a little, which
was much less than that of the AINPs + 1064 nm laser group (1 W/cm2). The poor performance of PTT effect in the NIR-I window
could be ascribed to the lower MPE and insufficient tissue penetration,
as the SLNs were generally located several millimeters beneath the
skin.51

Afterward, we assessed the
therapeutic efficacy of PTT in vivo. Mice with manifestation of SLN
metastasis were randomly divided into five treatment groups: (1) control
group, (2) PBS + 1064 nm laser group (1 W/cm2, 10 min),
(3) AINP group, (4) AINPs + 1064 nm laser group (1 W/cm2, 10 min), and (5) AINPs + 808 nm laser group (0.33 W/cm2, 10 min). PTT was conducted at 120 min after the primary tumors
were injected with AINP dispersion (5 mg/mL, 50 μL). At the
14th day, these mice were sacrificed by anesthetization, and their
SLNs were then dissected. The weights of SLNs for Groups I, II, III,
IV, and V were 24.66 ± 7.29, 24.74 ± 6.57, 21.58 ±
2.48, 8.18 ± 1.51, and 19.9 ± 7.41 mg, respectively (Figure 5a). As expected,
the noteworthy therapeutic effect was obtained in Group IV (AINPs
+ 1064 nm laser group) and was better than all of the other groups
including the AINPs + 808 nm laser group. To further evaluate the
therapeutic efficacy of PTT, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining
was then conducted. As observed in Figure 5e, a mass of necrosis and pyknosis (typical
thermal damage features of cells) emerged in Group IV. On the contrary,
the cells with intact morphology were presented in the remaining four
groups (Figure 5b–d,f).
These results consistently demonstrated that our obtained AINP dispersion
exhibited a great therapeutic effect for cancer PTT in the NIR-II
window.

Systematic In Vivo Biocompatibility
Assay of AINP Dispersion
At last, to promote further clinical
translation, the toxicological
mechanism of AINP dispersion was also carefully conducted. Twenty
healthy mice (∼4 weeks) were randomly divided into four groups,
including the control and three AINP-treated groups at different doses
(10, 50, and 100 mg/kg). After intravenous injection of AINP dispersion,
the body weights of mice in each group were measured every 3 days.
No apparent abnormal behavior and body weight loss of mice were monitored
in each group (Figure S8). Afterward, these
mice were sacrificed after one-mouth feeding. Their key organs were
collected for H&E staining, and the blood indexes were measured
for biochemical analysis. As shown in Figure 6, no obvious cell/tissue damage was observed
in these major organs even after intravenous injection of AINP dispersion
with elevated dosages up to 100 mg/kg, which was much higher than
our therapeutic dose (12.5 mg/kg) and that of other nanoparticles’
reported dose.11,20 The major blood indexes of the
mice including alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase
(AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine (CREA), albumin
(ALB), globulin (GLOB), white blood cells (WBC), red blood cells (RBC),
hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), red cell distribution width (RDW-SD),
mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), mean corpuscular
hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), blood platelet (PLT),
and platelet distribution width (PDW) in AINP-treated groups also
presented an ignorable change to those in the control group (Figure 7). Therefore, these
in vivo results strongly manifest the low toxicity and excellent biosafety
of AINP dispersion, which would pave the way for their future potential
clinical application.

Conclusions
We have subtly taken advantage of the versatile
ancient ink to
develop a green and effective strategy for PTT of tumor in the NIR-II
window. By simply leveraging PVP as the stabilizer, a stable AINP
dispersion with good water dispersity was prepared through hydrothermal
treatment. The AINP dispersion demonstrated excellent photothermal
performance and high photothermal conversion efficiency in the NIR-II
window. Besides, the desired black staining and the favorable PA imaging
capacity make it an ideal candidate for tumor SLN mapping. As revealed
by PA imaging, the AINP dispersion after being injected to the primary
tumors could effectually transfer into SLNs, which further promises
the great potential for PA imaging-guided NIR-II PTT of tumor SLN
metastasis. More importantly, both the preliminary in vitro and in
vivo trials together demonstrated that our obtained AINP dispersion
possessed benign biosafety.

However, to finally realize clinical
and translational applications
of AINPs, more pharmacology and toxicology of AINP dispersion are
obligatory. In addition, to achieve a preferable therapeutic effect,
the combination of AINPs together with the low-boiling-point phase
change agent by leveraging injectable in situ forming thermal responsive
hydrogel might also be carefully investigated in future work to realize
PTT and thermal mechanical destruction synergistic therapy.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Animals
AINPs were provided by Anhui
Jixi Medicine Ink Factory, China. Poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP, MW
≈ 58 000) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) and RPMI-1640 medium were obtained
from GE Healthcare Life Science. PI, calcein-AM, and CCK-8 were purchased
from Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology. Balb/c mice were provided
by the Shanghai BK Lab. The animal protocol was reviewed and approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Fudan
University. All experiments were performed in accordance with relevant
guidelines and regulations.

Preparation of AINP Dispersion
The
AINP dispersion
was prepared by a modified hydrothermal reaction. Briefly, raw AINPs
(100 mg) were added into a PVP–water solution (10 mL, 10 mg/mL)
under sonication. After the AINPs were completely dispersed, the resulting
solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave
(30 mL) and heated at 160 °C. The autoclave was cooled to room
temperature 6 h later, and the AINP dispersion was then obtained.

Cell Cytotoxicity and In Vitro PTT Assay
Approximately
1.0 × 104 CT-26 cells and HEK-293T cells were plated
in 96-well plates and cultured at the standard cell culture environment
for 24 h. The cells were mixed with different samples (0, 12.5, 25,
50, 100, 200, and 400 μg/mL, counted by AINPs) for 24 h to evaluate
the cytotoxicity of AINP dispersion. For the in vitro PTT assay, CT-26
cells were incubated in 96-well plates (2.0 × 105 cells
per well) and cultured for 12 h. Then, the AINP dispersion (12.5,
25, 50, and 100 μg/mL, counted by AINPs) was added to each plate
and incubated for another 4 h, followed by 5 min irradiation (808
nm: 0.33 W/cm2; 1064 nm: 1 W/cm2). Finally,
the CLSM imaging and flow cytometry analysis was also conducted, and
the detailed processes were provided in our previous work.11

In Vitro and In Vivo PA Imaging
CT-26 SLN metastases
were first induced by subcutaneous injection of 3 × 106 CT-26 cells suspended in 50 μL of PBS into the right hind
foot pad of nude mice.52,53 At the 30th day after inoculation,
the mice with spherical hard lumps in their popliteal fossa were selected
as the CT-26 SLN metastases for future experiments. The PA imaging
of AINP dispersion was conducted using the PA imaging system, and
the detailed processes were provided in our previous work.11

PA Imaging-Guided PTT of SLNs
Mice
(N = 35) exhibiting SLN metastases were divided randomly
into the following
five groups: control group, AINP group, 1064 nm laser (10 min, 1 W/cm2) group, AINPs + 1064 nm laser (10 min, 1 W/cm2) group, and AINPs + 808 nm laser (10 min, 0.33 W/cm2)
group. The NIR thermal imaging device was used to record the temperature
change. After 14 days, all of the mice were euthanized and the SLNs
of mice were dissected and fixed in 4% formalin solution for further
evaluation.

Systematic In Vivo Biocompatibility Assay
of AINP Dispersion
Twenty healthy mice (∼4 weeks)
were randomly assigned to
four groups, including control and three AINP-treated groups at different
doses (10, 50, and 100 mg/kg, counted by AINPs). After the intravenous
injection of AINP dispersion, the body weight of the mice was measured
every 2 days for 1 month. After that, the major organs from each group
were collected for H&E staining, and their blood samples were
collected to conduct the complete blood panel test.

Statistical
Analysis
GraphPad Prism 5 software was
used for statistical analysis. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
followed by Tukey’s post hoc test was used to determine differences
between groups. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001 were considered
statistically significant and n.s. represented no significance.
