Developing portable, lightweight,
and flexible energy storage systems
has become a necessity with the advent of wearable electronic devices
in our modern society. This work focuses on the fabrication of Co3O4 nanowires on a flexible carbon fabric (CoNW/CF)
substrate by a simple cost-effective hydrothermal route. The merits
of the high surface area of the prepared Co3O4 nanostructures result in an exceptionally high specific capacitance
of 3290 F/g at a scan rate of 5 mV/s, which is close to their theoretical
specific capacitance. Furthermore, a solid-state symmetric supercapacitor
(SSC) based on CoNW/CF (CoNW/CF//CoNW/CF) was fabricated successfully.
The device attains high energy and power densities of 6.7 Wh/kg and
5000 W/kg. It also demonstrates excellent rate capability and retains
95.3% of its initial capacitance after 5000 cycles. Further, the SSC
holds its excellent performance at severe bending conditions. When
a series assembly of four such devices is charged, it can store sufficient
energy to power a series combination of five light-emitting diodes.
Thus, this SSC device based on a three-dimensional coaxial architecture
opens up new strategies for the design of next-generation flexible
supercapacitors.

Introduction
Modern civilization is surrounded by myriads
of gadgets, chiefly
based on sensors and communication devices. With gradual miniaturization,
these gadgets have become wearable, leading to the necessity of being
flexible and portable. Parallel research has been culminating in the
development of energy storage devices to power these gadgets that
should themselves be flexible and lightweight. Supercapacitors and
lithium ion batteries are two major electrochemical energy storage
devices.1−4 They have a lot of advantages, such as their low cost, long life
span, and good reversibility, and most importantly, they are environment
benign. Owing to their high power density, supercapacitors are hugely
popular as power sources in portable electronic devices such as mobile
phones, e-readers, laptops, etc.5−9 It is well established that supercapacitors are a bridge between
the conventional battery and dielectric capacitor. However, their
main shortcoming is their low energy density due to their low working
potential in comparison to batteries.10 So, it is a big challenge among the research community to fabricate
such materials with improved energy density to meet the higher requirements
necessary for future technologies. Supercapacitors can be categorized
into two types on the basis of their charge storage mechanism: electric
double layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors. EDLCs store
electrical energy by electrostatic accumulation of charges on the
electrode–electrolyte interface, whereas in the case of pseudocapacitors,
fast and reversible redox reactions occur on the surface of the electrode,
exhibiting much higher specific capacitance than EDLCs.11 To date, carbonaceous materials (activated carbon,
graphene oxide,
carbon nanotubes, etc.)12−17 have been used as supercapacitor electrode materials due to their
good cyclic stability, however, they have not excelled because of
their low specific capacitance, which diminished the energy density
of the fabricated supercapacitors. To meet ever-increasing energy
demands, various inorganic metal oxides/hydroxides, such as MnO2, RuO2, CuO, NiO, V2O5, WO3, Co(OH)2, Ni(OH)2, etc.,18−28 have been used as electrode materials in electrochemical energy
storage. Also, conducting polymers, such as polyaniline, polypyrrole,
etc., are frequently used with metal oxides to improve their electrochemical
performance.29−31 Among researchers nowadays, it is a great challenge
to improve capacitive behavior.

It is now well known that nanostructures
of different metal oxides
have several advantages in various fields of potential applications
as well as in supercapacitors. However, low electrical conductivity
limits the performance of the metal oxide nanostructures as pseudocapacitor
materials. Additionally, in the conventional procedure of electrode
preparation, additives block a large part of the electroactive materials
from contacting with the electrolyte properly, so only the surface
part of the materials are utilized and effectively contribute to the
total capacitance. Henceforth, an improved design of electrode architecture
is hugely needed to boost specific capacitance as well as the electrochemical
usability of these pseudocapacitor materials. In this regard, recently,
metal oxide nanostructures have been directly grown on various conductive
substrates such as poly(ethylene terephthalate), copper foil, Ni foam,
etc.21,32,33 By using this
technique, many competitive advantages can be acquired, such as a
high amount of electron accessibility, fast ion transportation, and
easy diffusion of the electrolyte. Carbon fabric (CF) is one of the
most ideal substrates for the growth of nanostructures because of
its superior electrical conductivity and good mechanical stability.
In flexible power devices for modern electronic gadgets, lightweight
as well as bendable current collectors are used, and for this purpose,
CF is the most worthy candidate as a flexible current collector. There
are several reports regarding supercapacitors composed of a metal
oxide grown on a CF substrate.34−37 Cobalt oxide has been used a great deal in the supercapacitor
field as a promising pseudocapacitor material. There are many reports
on the use of different morphologies of Co3O4 to enhance capacitive behavior. For example, Yang et al. reported
ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets,38 Shim et al. reported flower-like microspheres of Co3O4 (RT-Co3O4),39 Liu et al. reported rhombus nanopillars and
nanobrush arrays,40 Chen et al. reported
urchin-like Co3O4 hollow spheres,41 Pal et al. reported ultra-small Co3O4 nanocubes,42 etc., for capacitive
performance. Also, with the same substrate, by tuning the morphology
using different amounts of additive, Yu et al. reported the morphology-dependent
capacitive behavior of Co3O4.43 Furthermore, Xia et al. reported self-supported Co3O4 nanowire arrays and mesoporous Co3O4 monolayer hollow-sphere arrays as pseudocapacitor materials
with high specific capacitance values.44,45 However, if
a self-oriented one-dimensional (1D) nanostructure can be grown directly
over the current collector substrate, then it can fully exploit the
redox reaction and enhance the capacitive behavior. So, keeping that
in mind, in our work, we successfully prepared 1D Co3O4 nanowires on a flexible, conducting CF substrate. The as-prepared
sample was examined in both aqueous electrolyte (three-electrode system)
and a solid-state medium, that is, in a gel electrolyte (two-electrode
system). By using a 3 M KOH aqueous electrolyte in the three-electrode
system, we obtained a significantly high specific capacitance of 3290
F/g at a scan rate of 5 mV/s. A specific capacitance of 764 F/g at
a current density of 1 A/g was achieved from the galvanostatic charge–discharge
(GCD) curve. The sample showed an excellent rate capability of 93.5%
after 2000 cycles. In addition, a high performance solid-state symmetric
device based on CoNW/CF was meticulously designed with CoNW/CF both
as the anode and cathode materials. This device delivered a highest
energy and power density of 6.7 Wh/kg (0.072 mWh/cm3) and
5000 W/kg (53.3 mW/cm3), showing good stability under several
bending conditions and after cycling for 5000 charge–discharge
cycles.

Results and Discussion
Vertically aligned, three-dimensionally
oriented Co3O4 nanowires were successfully prepared
by using a simple
hydrothermal method, and CF as the conducting substrate was used as
a growth platform. After hydrothermal reaction and postannealing treatment,
the intensely black Co3O4 nanowire arrays covered
the CF uniformly. Nucleation depends on the nature of the substrate.
Generally, CFs are hydrophobic in nature, so here, by a KMnO4 activation process, chemical seeding was done so that the fabric
became hydrophilic and the adhesion property increased. Also, this
seeding mechanism determines the morphology of the nanostructures.46 The growth of the nanostructure is briefly illustrated
in Scheme 1. After
the hydrothermal reaction, cobalt hydroxide carbonate formed over
the CF, and then after annealing in air, Co3O4 porous nanowires formed. The detailed plausible formation mechanism
of CoNW/CF has already been proposed in our previous published report.47 Using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), the crystallinity
and phase purity of CoNW/CF was examined. As can be seen from Figure 1a, at 2θ values
of 18.9, 31.3, 36.9, 44.9, 55.6, 59.5, and 65.3°, the strong
and sharp diffraction peaks can be ascribed to the lattice planes
of (111), (220), (311), (400), (422), (511), and (440), respectively,
which corresponds well with JCPDS card no: 42-1467 of cobalt oxide.
The XRD pattern also indicates good crystallinity of the as-prepared
CoNW/CF. A typically broad diffraction peak at a 2θ value of
26° and a small peak at 43° are attributed to the diffraction
peaks of the amorphous CF. Also, the XRD pattern marked with the lattice
planes of cobalt hydroxide carbonate on CF is shown in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information.

Figure 1 (a) XRD patterns of CF and CoNW/CF. The broad peak at
a 2θ
value of 26° is due to the graphitic nature of the CF. (b) Raman
spectra of Co3O4 NWs on CF (CoNW/CF) and bare
CF, the absence of any graphitic carbon peak indicates the uniform
and dense growth of the Co3O4 NWs on CF. Also,
in the inset, the Raman spectra of Co3O4 is
shown.

Scheme 1 Illustration
of Growth of Co3O4 Nanowires on a Flexible CF
(CoNW/CF)
Raman spectroscopy
was carried out for the bare carbon fabric and
CoNW/CF to better understand the growth of Co3O4 on the substrate. In the case of bare CF, there are two distinct
sharp peaks observed around 1363 and 1593 cm–1,
which represent the well documented D and G bands of carbon materials.
The Raman spectra of CoNW/CF correspond to the modes: F12g, Eg, F22g, F32g, and A1g of Co3O4 with
peaks at 197, 483, 522, 621, and 693 cm–1, as shown
in Figure 1b, and the
pattern matches well with previous reports. There were no other peaks
related to the carbon material detected in the Raman spectra of CoNW/CF,
which clarifies the uniform growth of the Co3O4 nanostructures over the CF.

In Figure 2, different
magnified images explore the morphology and microstructure of the
as-prepared nanostructures. The low magnification image in Figure 2a reveals that the
CoNW/CF 1D nanowire array architecture uniformly covers the skeletons
of each and every carbon fiber. The nanowires grow so densely that
they look like the furry body of a woolly caterpillar, and the wires
are almost vertical on the substrate. Also, the structures remain
largely unaffected, and their morphology remains intact, even though
the electrodes suffer repeated bending and twisting. The enlarged
field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images in Figure 2b,c show that the
nanowires are well distributed with sharp edges. Basically, by focused
observation of the nanowires in Figure 2c, it can be clearly observed that some nanowires are
mound together and have a tendency to bundle up at the top. The nanowires
have a length of about 3–3.5 μm and a tip diameter of
about 10–12 nm. Also, due to the decomposition of CO2 and H2O during annealing, porosity is created. So, these
types of structures possess very high structural porosity and the
surface area is significantly enhanced, which is indispensable when
choosing a suitable electrode material for supercapacitors, as the
number of electroactive sites can be increased due to these pores.
The morphologies and microstructures were also further affirmed by
the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images.
The low magnification image in Figure 3a shows the fine porosity of a nanowire and that the
pores are symmetrically distributed. Moreover, from the magnified
image in Figure 3b,
pores can be observed in the mesoscale range. This type of mesoporous
architecture is more favorable for penetration of electrolyte and
ionic movement to every accessible part of the nanostructure. The
high resolution image in Figure 3c shows the lattice fringes, from which the d-spacing can be calculated to be about ∼0.28 nm,
which corresponds to the (220) plane of cobalt oxide. The inset image
of Figure 3c clearly
shows the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern in the
reciprocal lattice space. The pattern illustrates the polycrystalline
nature of the as-prepared CoNW/CF nanostructures. The SAED pattern
of cobalt hydroxide carbonate also shows a polycrystalline
nature, as shown in Figure S2. Additionally,
elemental mapping by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) attached
with FESEM was done to inspect the distribution of the cobalt and
oxygen in a particular strand of CF, and is shown in Figure 3d–h.

Electrochemical Performance
To highlight the excellence
of the as-acquired CoNW/CF nanostructures, we explored their potential
application for energy storage as a supercapacitor device. The electrochemical
properties were evaluated in a three-electrode configuration with
a 3 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. To evaluate the pseudocapacitive characteristics,
cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out at different
scan rates (5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500 mV/s) in a potential
window of −0.2 to 0.7 V (vs Ag/AgCl). Also, as the CF is the
growth substrate, it is important to know if it contributes to the
supercapacitive behavior. Figure S3 in
the Supporting Information shows the comparative
CV curves (at a scan rate 10 mV/s) of CoNW/CF and the bare CF, and
it can be clearly observed that CoNW/CF exhibits much higher capacitive
current than that of the bare CF. So, the total capacitance is due
to the sole effect of the Co3O4 nanowires. CV
curves of the CoNW/CF electrode measured at various scan rates are
shown in Figure 4a.
Each and every voltammogram profile distinctly indicate that the
measured capacitance is due to surface faradic redox reactions for
charge storage, and up to a scan rate of 500 mV/s, two pairs of well-designated
redox peaks can be distinctly observed. These two pairs of redox peaks
indicate the change of oxidation state of the Co2+/Co3+ and Co3+/Co4+ reversible redox couples,
as shown in the following equations.48    With increasing scan rate from 5 to 500 mV/s,
that is, after a 100-fold increase of scan rate, a slight shift of
the redox peak is observed, which indicates the low resistance of
the electrode and that the ions can move very fast.36 Further details about the resistive nature of the electrode
were obtained by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements.
Here, we got the specific capacitance values from the CV curve by
using the equation below. 1  where
∫I(V) dV represents the area enclosed by the
CV curve, m is the active mass of the electrode material,
ΔV is the potential window, and υ is
the scan rate. At the lowest scan rate of 5 mV/s, the obtained specific
capacitance is 3290 F/g, which is significantly high and approaches
the theoretical capacitance value of cobalt oxide (3650 F/g).

(b) GCD curves of CoNW/CF electrode in three-electrode
system. (c) Obtained specific capacitance and current density plot,
as calculated from GCD curve. (d) Specific capacitance retention and
coulombic efficiency with cycle number.

Figure 4b
shows
the GCD profile of the CoNW/CF electrode at different current densities
from 1 to 10 A/g. Corresponding specific capacitance values were calculated
using the following equation. 2  where I is the discharging
current and Δt is the discharge time. The obtained
specific capacitance values were 764, 688, 630, 558, and 540 F/g,
respectively, at current densities of 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10 A/g.
The corresponding graph of specific capacitance with current density
is shown in Figure 4c. Although current density increases up to 10 A/g, the nanostructures
retain 70.6% of their initial capacitance. Predominantly, the capacitance
value decreases due to the increase of current density, as does the
internal resistance of the electrode. Ions can easily penetrate and
make contact with the entire electrode material at lower current density,
but with increasing current density, the permeation of the ions deceases
and the material at the outer surface of the electrode mainly contributes
to the overall capacitance. Here, we used a CF substrate as a binder-free
electrode, which itself is very conducting, so it favors ionic movement.
We show a schematic picture of ion movement between the nanostructures
in Figure 5. So, as
a soft, flexible substrate, CF not only enables the fast electrotransport
access and easy diffusion of ions, but it also eliminates the difficulties
and drawbacks that arise due to the slurry-making procedure of electrode
preparation with polymer binders. Cyclic stability is one of the predominant
requirements for high performance supercapacitors. Figure 4d shows the capacitance retention
and coulombic efficiency of the CoNW/CF electrode over 2000 cycles
conducted at a current density of 10 A/g. During the 2000 charge–discharge
processes, the corresponding coulombic efficiency approaches 100%,
which confirms that the material, by nature, possesses good reversibility.
Also, after 2000 cycles, it retains 93.5% of its initial capacitance,
suggesting that the material has good electrochemical stability. Moreover,
for reusability of any electrical equipment, the nanostructures of
the fabricating material should retain their morphology after many
cycles of operation. To verify this point, we provide the FESEM image
of the nanostructure of the CoNW/CF electrode after 2000 cycles, which
reveals the pristine nature of our nanostructures, in Figure S4 of the Supporting Information. However, electrochemical performance depends on
many factors like the concentration of electrolyte, mass of the active
material, area and thickness of the electrode, etc., and also the
measuring parameters, such as the scan rates and current densities.
So, on the basis of an overall study of the three-electrode system,
a rough comparison with data from some reports of Co3O4 and Co3O4 composite materials is shown
in Table 1 with references.

Further,
the charge transfer efficiency and electrical conductivity
of CoNW/CF were investigated by EIS and the electrical equivalent
circuit used in fitting the experimental EIS data. The Nyquist plot
of the material measured in a 3 M KOH aqueous electrolyte medium compared
with a fitted curve is displayed in Figure S5a,b (Supporting Information). An inclined
straight line at the low frequency region and a semicircle at the
high frequency region reveal the capacitive nature of the material.
The equivalent circuit is shown in the inset of Figure S5a. In the real axis, the intercept at the high frequency
domain indicates the equivalent series resistance (ESR/Rs), which comprises the inherent resistance of the electroactive
material, electrolyte bulk resistance, and the contact resistance
that arises at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Also, from the
diameter of the semicircle, we can get the contact resistance (Rct), which arises due to the diffusion of the
electrons. In the equivalent electrical circuit, R1 and R2 correspond to the
ESR and the charge transfer resistance (Rct), respectively. The values of R1 and R2 are 1.037 and 0.31 Ω. This improved
electrochemical behavior can be elucidated by considering the following
aspects: (1) Here, we performed the controlled growth of an electroactive
material, that is, Co3O4 nanowires directly
grown on the CF substrate, confirming good mechanical adhesion of
the nanostructure with the current collector as well as providing
a fast electronic transfer channel. (2) When using a polymer binder
and other additives, series resistance increases and the capacitance
value can be degraded. So, this issue can be eliminated here. (3)
Now, last but not least is the nature of the obtained nanostructures.
The unique growth of the 1D porous nanowires enables a sufficiently
high surface area to facilitate penetration of the electrolyte and
ion movement, which shortens the diffusion path.

Symmetric Supercapacitor
(SSC) Device Performance
As
the liquid electrolytic medium of the three-electrode system does
not fulfill the requirements for application, we have to test the
workability of CoNW/CF as a solid-state device. In symmetric configuration,
both the positive and negative electrodes are made of CoNW/CF (as
shown in Figure 6a)
and we tested the contribution of the nanostructures in device performance
without using any carbon-based materials (activated carbon, reduced
graphene oxide, etc.) as the negative electrode. A digital picture
in Figure S6 in the Supporting Information shows the device: two CoNW/CF layers
are pasted together with a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/KOH gel electrolyte
and separator. The CV and GCD curves of the CoNW/CF//CoNW/CF SSC device
at different voltage windows of 0–0.6 to 0–1.0 V are
shown in Figure 6b,c.
We selected the input potential range up to 1.0 V to further investigate
the device performance. Within this voltage limit, the CV curves maintain
a quasi-rectangular shape, which indicates that the CoNW/CF//CoNW/CF
SSC device shows ideal capacitive behavior. Also, the CV curves at
different scan rates (5–100 mV/s) in voltage window 0–1
V are shown in Figure 6d. With increasing scan rate, the CV curves retain their quasi-rectangular
shape without any redox peak, which implies that the fabricated device
performs as an EDLC. Figure 6e shows the charging–discharging profile of the as-prepared
SSC device at different current densities (0.26–5.33 mA/cm2). When designing a device, the area and volume of the electrodes
are the prime parameters to get a desired areal or volumetric capacitance.
We get a remarkably high volumetric capacitance for our SSC device.
The device provides a maximum volumetric capacitance of 517.33 mF/cm3 at a current density of 0.26 mA/cm2, and retains
a capacitance value of 43.6 mF/cm3 even at a high current
density of 5.3 mA/cm2. The required formulae for calculating
volumetric capacitance are given in the Supporting Information. These results show good rate capability. Also,
cyclic performance is one of the crucial parameters in the field of
practical application, so the cycling lifetime of the CoNW/CF//CoNW/CF
SSC device was examined at a current density of 4 mA/cm2 within a potential window of 0.0–1.0 V. The obtained result
shown in Figure 7a
is exceptionally good, confirming long-term cyclic stability. The
device retains 95.3% of its initial capacitance after 5000 charging–discharging
cycles, and the 1st and last 10 cycles are displayed in the graph
(as insets of Figure 7a), indicating the outstanding stability of the device. The obtained
result is much superior to some recent reports on CF.31 Also, Yu et al. reported manganese oxide nanorods on CF
and their symmetric device showed 76.5% capacitance retention after
5000 cycles,62 Jagadale et al. published
their symmetric Co(OH)2–Co(OH)2 supercapacitor,
which retained 81% initial capacitance after 5000 cycles,63 and Hu et al. reported a SSC of 3D Co3O4@NiO hierarchical nanowire arrays with a capacitance
retention of 91.35% after 5000 cycles.64 So, as a SSC, our fabricated device has remarkably good cyclic stability.
EIS study verified whether electronic movement is feasible in our
device. Figure 7b shows
the EIS plot of the as-prepared CoNW/CF//CoNW/CF SSC device before
cyclic performance as well as after 5000 cycles. The inclined line
in the low frequency region is nearly parallel to the imaginary axis,
which confirms that the device tends toward an ideal capacitive nature.
The ESR that we get from the intercept of the real axis at the high
frequency region is 2.8 Ω, which implies a charge transfer process,
and after 5000 cycles, this value increases slightly to 3.6 Ω.
So, although we use a gel electrolyte, the device is not so resistive,
even after long-term cyclic performance. Also, the capacitive behavior
was ensured by employing the device in some series and parallel combinations. Figure 7c,d shows the results
of the charge–discharge profiles of three devices connected
in series, and two devices in parallel, respectively. The obtained
results match well with the nature of a capacitor. Some discrepancy
observed in the charging and discharging time may be due to the slight
amount of mass change between the two or three different devices.

To investigate the potential
applicability of the SSC device, electrochemical
performance analysis was conducted under mechanical bending conditions
to ensure its flexibility. The cyclic voltammetric performance of
the device at a scan rate of 50 mV/s was observed under bending conditions
and was found to be the same as that under its normal configuration.
The obtained curves are shown in Figure S7 in the Supporting Information.

Figure S8 in the Supporting Information displays the gravimetric ragone plot
of our SSC device. The maximum energy density that we get for our
device is 0.071 mWh/cm3 at a power density of 2.66 mW/cm3 (6.7 Wh/kg at 248.65 W/kg) and the maximum power density
is 54 mW/cm3 at 0.006 mWh/cm3 (5000 W/kg at
0.55 Wh/kg). Calculation of power and energy density is given in the Supporting Information. To further illustrate
the practical use of the CoNW/CF//CoNW/CF SSC device, four CoNW/CF//CoNW/CF
SSCs were connected in series, and were able to light up a combination
(series) of five light-emitting diodes (LEDs) (as shown in Figure 8a). This series combination
of four SSC devices provided a voltage window of 4 V, and after charging
for 5 s, it was able to light up the series of five red LEDs for 1
min (Figure 8b). Due
to its high power density, the device was able to light up a combination
(series) of five white light LEDs (Figure 8c, Video).

Conclusions
In
summary, an ecofriendly, cost-effective simple chemical method
has been demonstrated to fabricate CoNW/CF, and this material was
used as a binder-free electrode for supercapacitor application. The
as-prepared nanostructures exhibit a significantly high specific capacitance
of 3290 F/g at a scan rate of 5 mV/s, which is very close to the theoretical
capacitance value of cobalt oxide. This high capacitance value is
attributed to the highly ordered 3D coaxial nanostructures on the
conductive CF substrate. Here, the CF facilitates electron transportation
and also enables application in the field of flexible electronics.
Moreover, a symmetric solid-state device was prepared by using two
CoNW/CF layers as positive and negative electrodes, which achieved
a good energy density of 0.071 mWh/cm3 at a power density
of 2.66 mW/cm3 (6.7 Wh/kg at 248.65 W/kg) and a power density
of 54 mW/cm3 at 0.006 mWh/cm3 (5000 W/kg at
0.55 Wh/kg). It is noteworthy that our fabricated device showed excellent
cyclic stability and retained 93.5% of its initial capacitance after
cycling for 5000 times. As a practical demonstration, CoNW/CF//CoNW/CF
SSC devices connected in series were able to supply sufficient energy
and power to light up a series of LEDs. This work comprises the first
demonstration of CoNW/CF used as a symmetric solid-state supercapacitor,
with improved performance for next-generation high performance flexible
energy storage devices.

Experimental Section
Materials
Cobalt
nitrate (Co(NO3)2) and ammonium fluoride (NH4F) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
and urea (CO(NH2)2), potassium permanganate
(KMnO4), KOH, and conc. H2SO4 were
of analytical grade and used as received without further purification.
Deionized (DI) water obtained from a Millipore water purification
plant was used throughout the experiment.

Synthesis of CoNW/CF
CoNW/CF was synthesized in a similar
way to that reported in our previous paper,47 which is briefly described as follows: Commercially available CF
was used as a supporting substrate material for the growth of the
Co3O4 nanowires. First of all, the CF was cleaned
by ultrasonication in acetone and subsequently DI water. Prior to
deposition, the CF substrate was chemically activated with KMnO4. As this is a liquid phase technique, it overcomes the other
difficulties that arise in the case of physical deposition. Additionally,
for growth on large area substrates, this technique is much more compatible.
A 100 mL nutrient solution was prepared by mixing three independently
prepared solutions: 50 mL of 50 mM Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 30 mL of 100 mM NH4F, and 20 mL of 250 mM urea
solutions, respectively. The obtained homogeneous pink solution was
transferred into a 100 mL stainless steel autoclave and the seeded
CF was mounted on a glass slide and inserted in an oblique manner
into the solution, keeping the activated surface down, which avoided
bulk precipitation, and also the surface facing down acted as a growth
platform. Then, the sealed autoclave was kept in a hot air oven at
120 °C for 6 h. After the hydrothermal reaction, the autoclave
was left to cool down naturally at room temperature. The obtained
pink colored CF was washed several times in a flow of doubly distilled
water and lastly with ethanol to remove impurities. After drying at
80 °C, the deposited substrate was annealed in a muffle furnace
at 400 °C for 3 h at a heating rate of 5 °C/min. Finally,
the intense black-colored CF was obtained, indicating the formation
of the Co3O4 nanostructures. The mass of the
active material was measured from the weight difference of the pure
CF and the electrode obtained after the growth of Co3O4 nanostructures.

Characterization
The composition
and crystallinity of the as-synthesized sample
were characterized by X-ray diffractometry (Bruker D8 Advance) employing
Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å), operating at 40 kV
and 40 mA in a 2θ range of 20–80°. Raman spectra
were obtained using a confocal Raman spectrometer (laser source of
λ = 532 nm, alpha300; Witec, Germany). The morphologies and
microstructures of the nanowires were inspected by FESEM (operated
at 5 kV, S-4800; Hitachi) and also EDS (Thermo Scientific attached
with Hitachi S-4800 operated at 15 kV) was used as a characterization
tool for spectral elemental analysis and determination of stoichiometry.
The microstructure was examined in more detail, as well as the lattice
spacing and SAED pattern, by HRTEM (operated at 200 kV, JEM 2100;
JEOL, Ltd.).

Electrochemical Measurements
All electrochemical measurements,
namely, CV, GCD, and EIS, were conducted in a three-electrode cell
of Gamry Interface 1000 (potentiostat/galvanostat/ZRA). Here, CoNW/CF
(1 cm2 area) was used directly as the working electrode;
the portion of CF supported by electroactive material was immersed
into the electrolyte keeping the bare portion outside for electrical
connection. A platinum wire and Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the
counter and reference electrode, respectively. Measurements were taken
in 3 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. The working potential window was −0.2
to 0.7 V with various scan rates in the range of 5–500 mV/s
for typical CV curves, and GCD was measured at a current density of
1–10 A/g. EIS measurements were performed in a frequency range
of 0.01 Hz to 1 MHz.

Fabrication of an All Solid-State SSC Device
The solid-state
SSC device was fabricated by assembling two pieces of CoNW/CF (as
the positive and negative electrode) with PVA/KOH gel electrolyte
and Whatman filter paper as a separator. First of all, the gel electrolyte
was obtained as follows: 3 g of PVA and 1.5 g of KOH were put in 30
mL of DI water, and the mixture was stirred vigorously with increasing
temperature. Then, the temperature was fixed at 90 °C, and stirring
was continued until the solution became clear and homogeneous. Gel
formation took place after about 1.5 h, and then it was left for some
time without heating and stirring to eliminate the excess bubbles
that formed during dissolution. After that, the two pieces of CoNW/CF
were dipped into the gel electrolyte keeping the un-deposited portion
of the CF outside. Also, the filter paper was soaked in the gel, and
then the electrodes and the separator were dried at room temperature
to evaporate the excess water. Finally, the two pieces of CoNW/CF
were assembled with filter paper between them. The electrochemical
characteristics of that cell were also tested at the same electrochemical
workstation (Gamry Interface 1000, Potentiostat/Galvanostat/ZRA)
