Although
titanium is the most commonly used dental implant material,
its biological aging directly leads to a lower rate of osseointegration.
The aim of this study is to treat aged titanium disc surfaces using
low-temperature argon–oxygen plasma (LTAOP) to obtain a more
hydrophilic surface in order to enhance biological activities of osteoblasts
on dental implant materials. In this study, smooth-machined titanium
(SM Ti) and sandblasted and acid-etched titanium (SLA Ti) substrates
were used. Aged titanium discs (SM and SLA Ti) were activated by LTAOP
and the surface properties were analyzed. Osteoblasts were then seeded
onto the aged and LTAOP-treated surfaces. Cell morphology, viability,
and features of osteogenesis were examined. We showed that after the
LTAOP treatment, the surfaces of both SM and SLA titanium substrates
become more hydrophilic with a larger active oxygen species composition,
whereas no obvious morphological changes were observed. Osteoblasts
were found to be attached and stretched well on the surfaces of LTAOP
treatment specimens. Moreover, the proliferation and osteocalcin secretion
of osteoblasts on the plasma-activated titanium samples were superior
to the untreated counterparts. LTAOP activation can enhance the attachment,
proliferation, and mineralization of osteoblasts on the surfaces of
the aged titanium substrates. This research provides a new strategy
to modify the surface of titanium dental implants for improved biological
functions.

==== Body
Introduction
Titanium implants, based on the theory
of osseointegration, have
become favorable options for tooth rehabilitation in the dental area
because of their excellent combination of biocompatibility properties.1 Osseointegration means a direct contact between
reconstructed bone tissue and the implants surfaces.2 Throughout the process of osseointegration, bone regeneration
around the implants is relatively slow and early mineral density of
newly formed bone is relatively low, even though the implant surfaces
have been modified in many ways such as physical, chemical, and biological
methods.3

It was related to the biological
aging of the implant surface,
which reduced the biological response of the peri-implant tissues
to the implant. Studies showed that although the surface of titanium,
which is the most widely used material in dental implant, had high
biological activities right after the (chemical or physical) modification,
the biological activities of dental implant materials usually decrease
along with time when exposed to air.4 This
time-dependent biological aging process can affect the interactions
between the implants and the proteins/cells.5 Explanations for this phenomenon have been proposed. The presence
of a surface native oxide layer (TiO2; titania; passive
film) of 2–5 nm thickness, which is naturally formed as titanium
is exposed to air, is crucial to the biocompatibility of titanium.
With high surface energy, the newly processed titania show enhanced
hydrophilic properties and exhibit high affinity to osteoblasts, and
thus increase cell proliferation in a short period of time.6 On the other hand, aged surfaces have a low hydrophilicity
level, which prevents proteins and extracellular matrix of osteoblasts
from adhering to the surface. Therefore, the cell attachment and proliferation
are reduced.5a In addition, the amount
of organic impurities containing hydrocarbon adsorbed on TiO2 increased after air exposure, which affects the initial affinity
level for osteoblasts, consequently affecting bone morphogenesis and
the degree of bone–titanium integration.5a,7 As
the bioaging of a titanium surface directly influences the initial
biological environment of bone formation and decreases the speed of
osseointegration, one of the longstanding challenges is how to maintain
the activity of titanium dental implants and/or restore the biological
functions of implant materials after bioaging, thus accelerating the
biological response of the peri-implant tissues to the implant.

In this study, we try to introduce low-temperature plasma to solve
this problem. Atmospheric-pressure low-temperature plasma, also called
cold plasma, is the partially ionized gas in the thermodynamic nonequilibrium
state.8 Because the electron temperature
is much higher than the ion temperature, the apparent temperature
of gas is usually much lower and even down to room temperature, making
it possible for chemical reaction to be carried out in the human mouth
besides the dental chair. Containing high-energy electrons and a large
number of excited atoms, molecules, ions, free radicals, and other
active substances, low-temperature plasma can produce different surface
treatment effects under different reaction conditions. (1) Surface
cleaning: under suitable discharge parameters, argon plasma can remove
chemical residues, adsorbed pollutants, impurities, and oxide layers
from the surface of pure titanium.9 (2)
Surface sterilization: low-temperature oxygen plasma can efficiently
kill Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, yeasts, fungi, and spores
as well as other microorganisms with active species generated in plasma.10 (3) Surface modification: surface modification
by low-temperature plasma can connect a large variety of chemical
functional groups to the surface of materials in a short time, resulting
in significantly improved surface wettability, cell compatibility,
and so forth.11 In addition, with no need
for time-consuming operational procedure under atmospheric pressure,
low-temperature plasma also has the advantages like high efficiency,
low energy consumption, safety, and no secondary pollution. These
results provide a theoretical basis for the application of cold plasma
in dental implant surface processing. In this study, we use argon
and oxygen mixture in a certain proportion as the input gas, and our
hypothesis is that low-temperature plasma produced by the argon and
oxygen mixture can produce an ideal effect on the titanium implant
surface activation.

Based on the advantages of low-temperature
plasma, the objective
of this study was to instantly activate the bioaged titanium surface
and restore bioactivity of the titanium surface via low-temperature
argon–oxygen plasma (LTAOP) treatment in order to enhance cell
attachment, proliferation, and mineralization. After the plasma treatment,
surface analysis including surface morphology, hydrophilicity, and
chemical composition was conducted. Moreover, Sprague-Dawley (SD)
rat osteoblasts were cultured and seeded onto different specimens
to examine the biological activity of the titanium materials. We hope
our study can provide an experimental basis for new ways to maintain
high biological activity of normal aging titanium before dental implantation
and thus accelerate the process of osseointegration.

Results
Surface Characterization
of LTAOP-Activated Titanium Samples
Surface Morphology
Surface morphologies of titanium
discs before and after LTAOP treatment were examined by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM). Smooth machined Ti (SM Ti) used in this study showed
a typical surface morphology of its kind with a smooth surface at
the supra-microscopic level, whereas there was a classic roughness
feature at the micron level on the surface of sandblasted and acid-etched
titanium (SLA Ti) disc (Figure 2A). However, there was no visible change
in surface morphologies before and after low-temperature plasma treatment.

almost 0°, which are significantly smaller than the control groups
(****, p < 0.0001). (D) Changes of CA of LTAOP-activated
titanium samples. After 2, 7, 14, 21 days following LTAOP treatment,
the CAs of distilled H2O on the SM Ti and SLA Ti increased
gradually as time elapsed. (E) Chemical composition of the titanium
samples measured by high-resolution XPS. (a,b) C 1s spectra, (c,d)

are for SLA Ti] were determined. (g) High-resolution XPS spectra of
Ti specimens without or with LTAOP treatments. (h) Atomic percentage
of each element on the surface before and after LTAOP treatment.

Surface Hydrophilicity
The hydrophilicity
of the control
and experimental groups was measured using water contact angle (CA)
analysis. There were significant differences of CAs between the control
and LTAOP-treated groups (p < 0.05) (Figure 2B,C). Before LTAOP
treatment, the water CA of the SM Ti and SLA Ti was 87.83 ± 0.33
and 76.80 ± 2.16°, respectively. After LTAOP treatment,
the CAs were not measurable because of the superhydrophilicity with
a CA of 0° (freshly processed samples; Figure 2C). However, after 2, 7, 14, 21 days following
LTAOP treatment, the CAs of distilled H2O on the SM Ti
and SLA Ti discs had changed to 16.13 ± 0.48 and 8.70 ±
0.51, 23.17 ± 0.34 and 23.43 ± 0.55, 44.80 ± 0.65 and
33.60 ± 0.82, 51.60 ± 0.73 and 44.30 ± 0.22°,
respectively (Figure 2D). These values were significantly higher than those of freshly
processed samples (p < 0.01).

Surface Chemistry
Chemical shifts and changes in the
chemical composition on each Ti surface were confirmed by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Figure 2E, both SM Ti and SLA Ti discs showed C 1s peaks, with
the dominant peak corresponding to the hydrocarbon (−CH) at
a binding energy of 285.0 eV (C1). Compared to samples without plasma
treatment, the carbon composition (C–H) of LTAOP-treated discs
decreased because of cleaning of carbon contamination on the titanium
discs (Figure 2E(a,b,g)).
Additionally, there was a small decline in the C2 peak (288.6 eV)
corresponding to carbon–oxygen (C–O) bonds for both
SM Ti and SLA Ti after LTAOP treatment. Similarly, the atomic content
of carbon following LTAOP treatment was lower than that of those samples
before LTAOP treatment, regardless of Ti surface morphology (Figure 2E(h)). In terms of
the O 1s spectra, the major peak corresponding to Ti–O at a
binding energy of 530.0 eV was evident for all the samples, and the
peak intensity was increased after LTAOP treatment compared to specimens
before LTAOP treatment, regardless of the Ti surface morphology (Figure 2E(c,d,g)). The observed
changes are considered to be able to increase the hydrophilicity of
the surfaces as well as the cell attachment capability.12 Additionally, the peak for the hydroxyl group
(−OH) on SM Ti and SLA Ti discs at a binding energy of 532.0
eV increased after LTAOP treatment. Further analysis revealed that
these changes resulted in an increase in the relative atomic content
of oxygen after LTAOP exposure for both SM Ti and SLA Ti discs (Figure 2E(h)). Finally (Figure 2E(e,f,g)), shows
the peaks for Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 (458.8 eV)
components; both peaks increased in intensity regardless of the Ti
surface morphologies after LTAOP exposure.

Enhanced Adhesion
and Spreading of Osteoblasts on LTAOP-Activated
Titanium Samples
The morphology of osteoblasts on the titanium
surfaces before and after LTAOP activation was observed by SEM. SEM
images of osteoblasts showed that the cells were larger on LTAOP-activated
titanium surfaces than on the untreated surfaces after 12 h of incubation
(Figure 3A). Cells
on treated surfaces demonstrated excellent adhesion and stretch, whereas
the majority of cells on the untreated surfaces were shrunk and in
round shape. On the surface of smoothly machined titanium discs treated
by plasma, cells were obviously flat and uniformly attached to the
surface of the material, and all the edges of the cells were stretched
and anchored. What was different on the surface of treated SLA Ti
was that cells are fibroid or polygonal in shape, extending thick
and long synapses around and forming a bridge across the rough area.
The quantification data show that the area of cells covering increased
dramatically after plasma treatment (Figure 3B).

Figure 3 Morphology and spreading behaviors of osteoblasts
on LTAOP-activated
titanium samples. (A) SEM images of osteoblasts morphologies cultured
on different surfaces. Scale bar represents 10 μm. (B) Quantification
of osteoblasts’ covering area in each group. The percentage
area of cells covering LTAOP-treated samples increased dramatically
compared to the control ones (***, p < 0.001).
(C) Images of cytoskeletal actin of osteoblasts imaged by laser confocal
microscopy. Scale bar represents 50 μm. (D) Quantification of
osteoblasts’ fluorescent area in each group. The percentages
of fluorescent area in LTAOP-treated groups were higher than those
in untreated groups (**, p < 0.01, ***, p < 0.001).

Figure 3C shows
the fluorescent staining of cytoskeletal actin of osteoblasts in all
tested samples. After 24 h of incubation, confocal microscopic images
of rhodamine phalloidin-stained osteoblasts showed that the cells
were larger and much more stretched with greater numbers of cells.
More intense and mature cytoskeletal development on plasma-treated
surfaces than on untreated surfaces was observed (Figure 3C). For SM Ti surfaces, cells
on treated surfaces showed a large area of long spindles around the
nucleus, and polygonal actin bundles arranged and stretched more fully
into a network with a number of cell processes, whereas the majority
of cells on the untreated surfaces were a triangle and did not show
enough cytoskeletal development. More interestingly, cells on treated
SLA Ti surfaces were stretched with development of lamellipodia-like
actin projections in multiple directions, which was specifically localized
in the ends of cellular processes. The quantification results show
that the areas of cells covering were significantly larger after the
plasma treatment (Figure 3D). However, the percent of fluorescent area in the SLA Ti
+ plasma group was lower than that of the SM Ti + plasma group, which
mostly likely originated from the different properties of SM and SLA
Ti surfaces.

LTAOP Promotes the Proliferation of Osteoblasts
on Activated
Titanium Samples
In this study, methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay was used to evaluate the viability of osteoblasts
cultured on the specimens before and after plasma treatment. The results
of osteoblast proliferation tests showed that the number of osteoblasts
in each group increased steadily with the extension of culture duration,
and there were more cells on plasma-activated surfaces than on untreated
surfaces (Figure 4A).
The cell proliferation rate of seeded osteoblasts on the SLA Ti group
was determined to be higher than those on the SM Ti groups. However,
there are no significant differences between the SM Ti + plasma group
and the SLA Ti + plasma group. It was proved that the titanium surface
treated by low-temperature plasma could efficiently promote the proliferation
of osteoblasts.

Figure 4 Proliferation and mineralization of osteoblasts on LTAOP-activated
titanium samples. (A) MTT assay results showed after 5 days of culture
that the rates of proliferation increased substantially in cultures
seeded on plasma-treated surfaces (*, p < 0.05,

of osteoblast cells on the titanium surface showed after 14 days of
culture that OCN secreted by osteoblasts in the LTAOP-treated groups
were significantly higher than those in the control groups (***, p < 0.001, control vs treated groups, ####, p < 0.0001, day 7 vs day 14).

LTAOP Promotes the Mineralization of Osteoblasts on Activated
Titanium Samples
The results of the osteocalcin (OCN) assays
are shown in Figure 4B. On days 7 and 14, the OCN secreted by osteoblasts increased gradually
in both the plasma-treated and control groups. Furthermore, OCN secreted
by osteoblasts on the plasma-treated groups were significantly higher
than those on the control surfaces. These results indicate that plasma-activated
titanium surfaces could efficiently promote the mineralization of
osteoblasts.

Discussion
Interactions between
the dental implants and alveolar bones are
crucial for the clinical success of dental implants.13 The bioactivity nature of implants’ surfaces plays
important roles in the osseointegration process.14 Titanium-based materials’ aging process directly
affects their biological responses,5a leading
to a lower rate in the process of osseointegration. Prevention of
an unwanted aging process as well as development of activation strategies
for aged materials are important. One aim of this study was to apply
the recently highlighted portable LTAOP to modify the titanium surface.
Another aim was to explore whether LTAOP activation can enhance the
attachment, proliferation, and mineralization of osteoblasts on the
titanium surfaces.

Several groups have produced promising results
by modifying implants
using low-temperature plasma with argon gas. Duske et al. treated
different surfaces of titanium sheets with argon plasma jet, and found
that the extensibility of the seeded osteoblasts was significantly
improved.11 Coelho et al. embedded dental
implants into the mandible of Beagle dogs after treatment with argon
plasma at atmospheric pressure, and showed that the implant-bone contact
rate of the treatment group was significantly higher than that of
the control group at 3 weeks, indicating that argon plasma-modified
implant surfaces can enhance early bone reaction of Beagle dogs.15 We have demonstrated previously that in a low-temperature
plasma environment, the argon and oxygen mixture in a certain proportion
can generate a large amount of energetic species such as active oxygen,
by energy transfer reaction, the formation of which can make the surface
energy of the treated material increase significantly.16 This in vitro study showed that LTAOP may be
effective to activate the titanium implant surface for bone healing.

LTAOP activation has proven its efficacy on aged surfaces of commercially
pure Ti-based materials without altering their existing morphologies.
This was consistent with the results of previous studies.17 As shown in the results, there were significant
changes of surface hydrophilicity and chemistry on the titanium surfaces.
The CAs of experimental groups’ Ti were not measurable, proving
the superhydrophilicity of the surfaces with LTAOP treatment. Plasma
generated with argon as input gas has been shown to create hydrophilic
surfaces,18 whereas in our study LTAOP
could also produce superhydrophilic characteristics on titanium surfaces.
The mechanism of superhydrophilic characteristics involves numerous
kinds of chemical reactions and specific changes in chemical composition
following LTAOP treatment, as XPS has revealed. In terms of chemical
functional groups, the amount of carbon was decreased whereas oxygen-bonded
compounds increased after the LTAOP treatment. Consistent with the
other study,19 XPS results indicate that
the constituents of the LTAOP are active enough to break the C–H
bonds at the surface layer to form radicals that yield various reactive
oxygen species on the surface. The carbon, as the result of the unavoidable
attachment of carbon-containing atmospheric component on the surface,
is normally identified on the surfaces. However, the adsorption of
carbon on the surface could potentially reduce biological activity
and it should be reduced to achieve improved activity.19b,20 The reduction of the carbon peak intensity and increase in the oxygen
peak intensity were related to two aspects of changes on the surface
with plasma treatment: surface cleaning by removing carbon chemical
residues and simultaneous surface modification by connecting a large
number of oxygen-bonded functional groups onto the surface of substrate.
Moreover, the peaks for Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 components increased in intensity after plasma exposure. It indicated
the surface changes in the electrochemical structure of titanium,
which might generate charge loading via electronic transition by the
energy of the plasma.

Osteoblasts taken from skull bone of newborn
SD suckling mice were
used to evaluate the biological and osteogenic effects of different
titanium surfaces. Cell morphological changes demonstrated that on
the surface of titanium activated by LTAOP, cells showed a flattened
shape and anchored evenly to the surface, exhibiting excellent adhesion
and stretch properties with great numbers of cell processes and mature
cytoskeletal development. This result confirmed that LTAOP used in
this study could be a very feasible way to enhance cellular responses
on titanium implants’ surfaces. This could be related to the
increase in the surface oxygen-bonded radicals and a decrease of carbon
impurities after plasma treatment, which would further increase the
surface hydrophilicity and surface energy.21 In fact, the surface energy of the material plays an important role
in promoting early cell adhesion. The higher of the surface energy
induces the better of the early attachment of osteoblasts. Additionally,
the generation of oxygen-bonded components could absorb fibronectin
to regulate the structure of proteoglycan and the cytoskeleton.22

This study also demonstrated that LTAOP
activation on Ti was effective
in increasing the proliferation and mineralization of osteoblasts.
After 1, 3, and 5 days of culture, MTT assays showed that the surfaces
submitted to the LTAOP treatment allowed a sufficient increase in
the cell proliferation in comparison with control groups. To ascertain
the effects of the LTAOP on mineralization, we examined the activity
of OCN, a protein serving as a marker of osteoblast mineralization.
Results revealed that LTAOP activation of Ti surfaces can promote
OCN expression, which was expected to increase the cell mineralization.
These changes were because of the introduction of hydrophilicity,
the possible adsorption of adhesive proteins including fibronectin,
and the consequent upregulation of integrin-mediated signaling pathways.
Furthermore, free radicals like hydroxyl radicals and exposed charged
particles on the Ti surface treated with argon–oxygen plasma
might accelerate intracellular bioelectrical signaling transduction
and stimulate osteoblast proliferation. Bioelectrical signaling, including
all the changes in the resting voltage potential of the plasma membrane
driven by ion channels, pumps, and gap junctions, serves as a highly
efficient information-bearing pathway that regulates cell proliferation,
migration, and differentiation.23

In this study, we observed that there were some different results
between rough-surfaced titanium and smooth ones. Sandblast-etched
titanium as commonly used implant surfaces in studies showed higher
hydrophilicity and increased relative atomic content of oxygen after
LTAOP exposure compared to SM Ti. In agreement with previous studies,24 osteoblasts adherent to SLA Ti have been revealed
to proliferate slightly faster than those adherent to smooth-surfaced
ones. However, after LTAOP activation, osteoblasts on different surfaces
showed a similar growth trend and level of proliferation and mineralization,
which are not affected by surface morphology.

Also, there are
other ways of restoring bioactivity of aged titanium
such as photo-functionalization with UV light.25 In a recent study, Canullo et al. confirmed that the effects
of UV and plasma on different titanium surfaces. They found similar
effects on protein adsorption and cell adhesion with plasma after
12 min of treatment and UV light after 3 h of treatment.26 Compared to UV, LTAOP could activate the surface
of titanium in a shorter time by a few minutes, even seconds. Moreover,
low-temperature plasma could connect many different kinds of chemical
functional groups onto the surface such as reactive oxygen species,
so that the surface wettability and cell compatibility of materials
could be significantly improved. These results provide a new method
for the application of cold plasma in dental implant surface activation.27 It was observed that the hydrophilicity of the
plasma-treated surfaces decreased gradually, and the effects on osteoblasts’
attachment, proliferation, and mineralization need further investigation.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we investigated the effect of LTAOP activation of
aged SM Ti and SLA Ti surfaces. The LTAOP-activated surface showed
carbon-cleaned and oxygen-enriched hydrophilicity. Osteoblast cells’
adhesion, proliferation, and mineralization were all significantly
improved. With further in vivo studies, the low-temperature plasma
treatment could be a potential effective approach to activate titanium-based
dental implants for improved performances.

Experimental Section
Titanium
Sample Preparation
SM Ti and SLA Ti are two
kinds of commonly studied titanium-based implant materials. Titanium
samples were prepared in disc (diameter, 15 mm; thickness, 1 mm) form
by machining commercially pure titanium (grade 4). All discs were
kindly provided by the Biomaterials Research Center, Sichuan University.
SM surfaces were used as they were, whereas roughened surfaces were
prepared by blasting with 50 μm Al2O3 particles
for 1 min at 3 kg/m followed by etching with 19% hydrofluoric acid
(w/w) at room temperature for 30 s. Titanium samples were then stored
under dark ambient conditions for 6 weeks to allow sufficient aging.7a After the aging process, the specimens were
decontaminated by ultrasonic rinse using a series of acetone, ethanol,
and deionized water for 10 min each, and then sterilized through autoclave.

LTAOP Activation
Titanium samples in the experimental
groups were activated by LTAOP treatment using an atmospheric pressure
glow discharge plasma system. Plasma polymerization was carried out
using the Atmospheric Pressure Plasma System model AS400+PFW10, manufactured
by Plasma Treat GmbH (Steinhagen, Germany). This plasma system, powered
by a low-frequency power (19 kHz) supply and matched network, is a
glow-discharge plasma workspace with dimensions of 33 cm by 12.5 cm.28 A schematic diagram of the system is shown in Figure 1A.

Sample surfaces
were cleaned and bombarded for 5 min with argon gas, and then underwent
plasma treatment. Argon (Ar, 95%) and oxygen (O2, 5%) were
used to generate plasma. Argon gas carried the precursor vapors to
the jet outlet at a flow rate of 300 L/h. The precise mass flow rates
were ensured with the aid of an integrated mass flow meter acting
in conjunction with the control system. The substrates were fixed
on an aluminum plate and the plasma jet was controlled by an X/Y/Z motion system. The
plasma voltage, current, and duty ratio were 320 V, 21.4 A, and 0.6,
respectively. To evaluate the plasma efficiency on Ti discs, the Ti
discs were placed 2 cm in front of a nozzle (diameter = 5 mm) in the
plasma system and exposed to plasma for 90 s (Figure 1B). It should be noted that the freshly processed
samples were used in the surface property analysis and cell culture
studies.

Surface Characterization of Titanium Samples
Surface Morphology
The surface morphology was examined
before and after the LTAOP activation using SEM (VEGA TESCAN, Czech
Republic).

Surface Hydrophilicity
Before and
after the LTAOP treatment,
changes in the hydrophilicity of SM Ti and SLA Ti discs were evaluated
by water CA analysis. Distilled water (10 μL) was placed on
the center of each specimen surface for 10 s, and the CA was confirmed
by capturing the image at room temperature using a live video CA measurement
system (Phoenix a, Meiwa-forces, Japan). Potential time-dependent
change in hydrophilicity was determined for different surfaces. Freshly
prepared, 2-day-old, 1-week-old, 2-week-old, and 3-week-old surfaces
were all examined.

Surface Chemistry
Surface chemical
composition of the
control and treated groups was confirmed using X-ray photoelectron
spectra (Thermo Escalab 250XI, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). A monochromatic
Al Kα source was operated as the X-ray source (Al Kα line:
1486.6 Ev). The binding energy was referenced and calibrated to the
C 1s peak at 284.8 Ev. The atomic composition and characteristics
of C, O, and Ti were analyzed for each group.

Osteoblast
Cell Culture and Identification
SD 1–3
day-old rats were immersed in 75% ethanol for 5 min, and the skull
bones were taken under aseptic conditions with ophthalmic scissors.
The attached connective tissue was removed with tweezers as much as
possible. The bone tissue was soaked for 5 min in antibiotic solution
(100 u/mL penicillin, 100 u/mL streptomycin). The tissue was rinsed
three times in phosphate buffered solution (PBS), and then cut into
small pieces of about 1 mm3 in size in a Petri dish containing
an appropriate amount of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium. The shredded tissue pieces were evenly placed on the bottom
of the culture flask at a distance of 5 mm between small pieces. Alpha-MEM
cell culture medium (5 mL, LM008-01, Welgene, Korea) combined with
10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, USA), 1% 100 u/mL penicillin, and 100
u/mL streptomycin were injected into the bottle. The flask was tilted
after cap closure, and placed in an incubator with 5% CO2, 37 °C. After 4 h of stasis, the culture bottle was slowly
turned over, so that the culture medium could completely soak the
tissue block on the wall of the bottle. Then, the culture bottle was
placed back in the incubator. At 80% confluency, the cells were purified
three times by way of differential velocity adherences between osteoblasts
and fibroblasts. After being transferred to the third generation,
cells were identified as osteoblasts by methods of alkaline phosphatase
staining and calcium nodule staining. Then, osteoblasts cultured to
the third generation were detached with 0.25% trypsin and seeded onto
the titanium discs with a density of 1 × 104 cells/mL.
The culture medium was renewed every 3 days.

Morphology and Spreading
Behaviors of Osteoblasts on Titanium
Samples
SEM was used to observe the morphology of osteoblasts
on the titanium surfaces. Cell suspension was inoculated into a 24-well
plate containing titanium samples with a dilution density of 1 ×
104 cells/mL; 12 h after seeding, cells underwent the following
series of processes in order to be observed by SEM—fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde for 60 min, rinsed twice in PBS, fixed in 1% osmium
acid for 60 min at 4 °C, dehydrated in 50–100% ethanol,
and immersed in isoamyl acetate for 30 min. After critical point drying
and vacuum spraying, the morphology of the osteoblasts on titanium
surfaces was imaged by SEM.

The spreading behavior and cytoskeletal
arrangement of osteoblasts seeded onto titanium surfaces were examined
using confocal laser scanning microscopy (Leica TCS SP5 II, Leica
SPE, Germany). In order to visualize the localization of actin, at
24 h after seeding, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained
using the fluorescent dye rhodamine phalloidin (actin filament, red
color) (40734ES75, Yeasen Biotech Co., Ltd., China). 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole
(cell nucleus, blue color) (40728ES03, Yeasen Biotech Co., Ltd.) was
used for counterstaining. Image collection was performed in triplicate
and representative images are shown. The areas of cell covering were
quantified using image analysis software (ImageJ, NIH, Bethesda, ML).

Cell Proliferation Assay
MTT (thiazole blue) assay
was employed to evaluate the cell proliferation. Osteoblasts cultured
to the third generation were seeded onto the specimens at a density
of 2 × 104 cells/mL with a volume of 200 μL
and cultured for 1, 3, 5 days in the 24-well plates. MTT (20 μL,
C0009, Beyotime, China) reagent (5 mg/mL) was added and incubated
for another 2 h. After aspirating the supernatant in the well, 150
μL of dimethyl sulfoxide was added to each well and the plates
were shaken for 10 min. Absorbance of the final solution was measured
at 450 nm and cell viability was calculated according to optical density
value. Experiments were performed in three replicates. Means and standard
deviations are shown.

OCN Assay
OCN is an osteoblast-specific
protein and
regarded as a marker of differentiated osteoblast cells. Its activity
assay can provide insight into the ability of osteoblast cells to
mature and mineralize. After osteoblast cells were seeded onto the
specimens and cultured for 7 and 14 days, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) kit (E-EL-R0243c, Elabscience Biotechnology Co., Ltd.,
China) was used to detect the expression levels of OCN quantitatively.
The ELISA procedure was performed according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Experiments were repeated three times. Means and standard
deviations are shown.

Statistical Analysis
The number
of samples was three
for all in vitro culture studies (n = 3). Mean values
and SDs were calculated for each outcome variable in this work. Differences
before and after LTAOP treatment were analyzed via Analysis of Variance
method. Statistical significance was accepted at a confidence level
of 95% (p < 0.05). Statistical analysis was performed
with SPSS 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).
