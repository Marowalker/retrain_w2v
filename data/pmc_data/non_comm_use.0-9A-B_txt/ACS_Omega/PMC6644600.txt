Graphene
oxide (GO) was cross-linked with chitosan to yield a composite
(GO-LCTS) with variable morphology, enhanced surface area, and notably
high methylene blue (MB) adsorption capacity. The materials were structurally
characterized using thermogravimetric analysis and spectroscopic methods
(X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman
spectroscopy, and 13C solid-state NMR) to support that
cross-linking occurs between the amine groups of chitosan and the
−COOH groups of GO. Equilibrium swelling studies provide support
for the enhanced structural stability of GO-cross-linked materials
over the synthetic precursors. Scanning electron microscopy studies
reveal the enhanced surface area and variable morphology of the cross-linked
GO materials, along with equilibrium and kinetic uptake results with
MB dye in aqueous media, revealing greater uptake of GO-LCTS composites
over pristine GO. The monolayer uptake capacity (Qm; mg g–1) with MB reveals twofold variation
for Qm, where GO-LCTS (402.6 mg g–1) > GO (286.9 mg g–1). The kinetic
uptake profiles of MB follow a pseudo-second-order trend, where the
GO composite shows more rapid uptake over GO. This study reveals that
the sorption properties of GO are markedly improved upon formation
of a GO–chitosan composite. The facile cross-linking strategy
of GO reveals that its physicochemical properties are tunable and
versatile for a wider field of application for contaminant removal,
especially over multiple adsorption–desorption cycles when
compared against pristine GO in its highly dispersed nanoparticle
form.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
development of advanced materials for the controlled removal
of dyes and organic contaminants from effluent originating from printing,
food, textile, paper, and pharmaceutical industries1,2 is
an active area of research. Many dye species are known to be carcinogenic
and can affect water quality, as shown by undesirable human and ecosystem
health effects.3 Adsorption-based removal
is an efficient process for the capture of dyes and contaminants from
wastewater systems. Solid phase adsorbents represent an effective
remediation strategy because of their technical simplicity, high efficiency,
low cost, and potential reuse of the adsorbent.4,5 Therefore,
continued effort is required for the development of an efficient,
novel, and cost-effective solid adsorbent material.

Recently,
graphene- and graphene oxide (GO)-based materials have
been studied for applications in adsorption and water treatment.6,7 In particular, GO has emerged over the past decade as a next-generation
material for wastewater treatment because of its low-cost production,
large surface area, and strong interaction with a wide range of anionic,
cationic, or neutral dyes in aqueous media.8,9 Graphene
is comprised of sp2-hybridized carbon
atoms arranged in a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice. In contrast
to graphene, which has a low aqueous solubility, GO is highly dispersible
in water and organic solvents because of the presence of polar functional
groups and high surface area.9 The highly
negative charge density of GO in aqueous solutions provides effective
adsorption sites for cationic dyes,6 such
as methylene blue (MB) and serves as a material for gas capture (e.g.,
N2 and CO2) applications.10,11 Although GO is a promising material as an adsorbent, efficient recovery
is problematic because of its tendency of forming stable colloids
that hinder phase separation. However, the use of polymers to immobilize
GO offers an opportunity to produce composite materials with unique
properties for solid phase separation and adsorption.

Fabrication
of framework structures from individual GO sheets was
studied using physical and chemical interactions to yield GO self-assembled
films, hydrogels, and aerogels.12,13 However, produced GO
frameworks have limited applications in wastewater treatment because
of scalability as a result of repulsive hydration forces between GO
layers that result in electrostatic separation.14 Therefore, the development of stable interconnected GO
frameworks is one strategy for the successful application of these
materials in wastewater treatment. Previous works reveal that cross-linking
and other forms of synthetic modification of GO sheets can improve
the sorption properties, as shown by the variation in methylene blue
uptake (cf. Table S1, Supporting Information).15,16 The resulting material would offer higher
sorption capacity compared to pure GO because of the increased available
adsorption sites as well as improved stability and mechanical structure
for producing thin films.17,18

GO framework
structures can be achieved by cross-linking GO sheets
through noncovalent or covalent bonds by using biopolymers as cross-linkers.15,19 Chitosan (CTS) is among a group of abundant renewable biopolymers20 that has been used as an adsorbent for removal
of organic dyes from aqueous solution because of the presence of active
adsorption sites (hydroxyl and amino groups).21 CTS can undergo an amidation reaction with the carboxyl groups of
GO to form a homogenous and well-dispersed GO composite.22,23 On the basis of the foregoing considerations, a key objective of
this study was to develop a facile method for the preparation of a
GO composite by cross-linking GO with CTS to obtain a material with
improved physicochemical properties for sorption-based applications.
To this end, spectroscopic methods [Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR)] were used to characterize the structure and composition of
cross-linked GO composites. Also, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to analyze the thermal
stability and surface morphology of the GO composites. The adsorption
properties were evaluated under equilibrium and kinetic conditions
using MB in aqueous solution. It will be shown that this study contributes
significantly to the field of sustainable GO composites through the
development of a suitable adsorbent for contaminant removal with tunable
properties that exceed those of GO alone, and also can be reused for
multiple cycles of adsorption–desorption. Also, this study
advances the field of GO composites by use of a facile cross-linking
methodology that is low cost and ecofriendly, where the structure
of the composites are supported by several complementary methods.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
Low
molecular weight CTS
(LCTS) (Mw = 950 000 Da, 75–85%
deacetylation), sodium nitrite (NaNO3), potassium permanganate
(KMnO4), sulfuric acid (98%, ACS grade), MB (high purity,
biological stain), and hydrogen peroxide (30 v/v %) used in this study
were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Canada Ltd. HPLC-grade methanol was
obtained from Fisher Scientific, NJ, USA. Filter paper (Ahlstrom grade
613, 7.5 cm) and graphite flakes, natural, 325 mesh, 99.8% (metals
basis) were obtained from Alfa Aesar Thermo Fisher Scientific and
further purified by Soxhlet extraction for 24 h using HPLC-grade methanol,
followed by drying in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 h to remove
impurities.

2.2 Synthesis of GO
GO was synthesized
from graphite flakes using the modified Hummer’s method.24 Briefly, 100 mL concentrated H2SO4 was added into a 500 mL flask filled with 4 g of graphite
in an ice bath, followed by the addition of 2 g of NaNO3, and stirred for 4 h. Then, 12 g of KMnO4 was gradually
added while the mixture was stirred for 2 h. The ice bath was removed,
and the system was heated at 35 °C for another 30 min. Subsequently,
240 mL of distilled water was slowly added to the system, which caused
a temperature rise to 90 °C, and continued to stir for another
30 min. Then, 160 mL of water and 30 v/v % H2O2 were added to terminate the reaction. The solution was stirred overnight
and purified using multiple washings with Millipore water, HCl (30%),
and ethanol until it reached neutrality (pH 7). After multiple washings,
the solid GO was vacuum-dried at 40 °C to obtain dried GO powder.

2.3 Preparation of GO–CTS Cross-Linked
Composite
The composite materials (GO-LCTS) were prepared
by making the GO solution with a concentration of 3 mg/mL. LCTS solution
was produced by dissolving 5 g of LCTS in 500 mL of 1 v/v % glacial
acetic acid with stirring. The resulting LCTS solution (1 v/v %) was
added drop-wise to the GO solution with continuous stirring for about
4 h. The mixture was neutralized to pH ≈ 7 using 1 M NaOH followed
by stirring for 12 h. Herein, several cross-linked GO samples were
prepared with variable precursor weight ratios. The results reported
herein are focused on GO-LCTS with 1:0.3 (w/w) ratio because this
condition affords a minimum amount of cross-linker level to stabilize
the GO-LCTS composite. The solution was washed with Millipore water
followed by pouring onto a glass surface and dried at ambient conditions
for 48 h to obtain the GO-LCTS films with an average thickness ranging
from 20 to 60 μm. An outline of the experimental sequence is
shown in Figure 1.

procedure for cross-linked GO-LCTS composite materials.

2.4 Characterization
2.4.1 Surface Charge (ζ Potential) Measurement
The
ζ potential of the GO solutions (0.01 w/v %) were measured
at various pH values (4–12) using a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Nano
ZS90, Malvern, UK), before and after cross-linking. All samples were
diluted to 0.01 w/v % and measured in Milli-Q water at different pH.

2.4.2 Scanning Electron Microscopy
The
surface morphology and surface topography of non-cross-linked and
cross-linked composite materials were studied using SEM (Hitachi model
SU8010). SEM images of samples were collected under an accelerating
voltage (5 kV).

2.4.3 FTIR Spectroscopy
A Bio-Rad FTS-40
IR spectrophotometer was used to obtain the IR spectra of the composite
materials. The sample powder was mixed with pure spectroscopic-grade
KBr (weight ratio: 1:10). The FTIR spectra were obtained in reflectance
mode with a resolution of 4 cm–1 over a spectral
range of 400–4000 cm–1.

2.4.4 Raman Spectroscopy
The Raman spectra
of pure GO and cross-linked GO-LCTS samples were obtained to monitor
changes in the degree of order–disorder of the GO structure
after cross-linking using a Renishaw Raman spectrophotometer equipped
with an inVia reflex optical microscope and a laser excitation wavelength
of 514.5 nm over the spectral range 3700–5000 cm–1.

2.4.5 13C Solid-State NMR
The 13C solid NMR spectra of GO and GO-LCTS composite
material were obtained using a Bruker AVANCE III HD spectrometer equipped
with a 4 mm DOTY cross-polarization with magic angle spinning (CP/MAS).
Spectra were acquired using CP/MAS using a solid probe operating at
125.77 MHz (1H spectral frequency at 500.23 MHz). The 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra were acquired using a contact time of
0.75 ms, MAS at 10 kHz, and 1H 90° pulse of 3.5 μs,
with a ramp pulse on the 1H channel. All spectral data
were recorded using 71 kHz SPINAL-64 decoupling during acquisition
with external reference to adamantane at δ = 38.48 ppm.

2.4.6 X-ray Diffraction
The X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of GO and cross-linked composite materials were obtained
using a PANalytical Empyrean powder X-ray diffractometer equipped
with a Co source and X’Celerator detector. The powdered samples
were placed in a horizontal mode and mounted for the test. The PXRD
patterns were measured in continuous mode over a range of 5–60°
2θ, with a scan speed of 335 ms/step (3°/min).

2.4.7 Thermogravimetric Analysis
Thermal
stability and decomposition temperature of the materials were measured
using a TA Instruments Q50000IR TGA system, which was operated from
23 to 500 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C min–1 under a nitrogen atmosphere.

2.4.8 Equilibrium
Swelling Properties
The swelling properties and water uptake
of the GO-LCTS composites
and the precursors (graphite, LCTS, and GO) were evaluated by immersing
50 mg of the material in 12 mL Millipore water as the solvent and
equilibrated in a horizontal shaker for ∼24 h.25 The weight of swollen samples (Ws) was determined by weighing hydrated samples after removing excess
surface water with filter paper. By drying the hydrated samples in
an oven at 60 °C, the dry weight (Wd) was obtained and the water swelling (Sw) was calculated using eq 1 as below 1  

2.5 Sorption Studies of GO-LCTS Composite
2.5.1 MB
Sorption of GO-LCTS Composite
The equilibrium MB uptake capacity
of GO and GO-LCTS composites was
evaluated by batch mode using fixed amounts of adsorbent in sealed
glass vials. The adsorption isotherms obtained by such batch mode
conditions used a dosage of 5 mg adsorbent with 7 mL MB solution (pH
= 7) at variable initial MB (100–1000 μM). Samples were
mixed on a horizontal shaker (SCILOGEX SK-O330-Pro) for 24 h to ensure
equilibrium. A 1 mM stock solution of MB in water was prepared, and
other solutions were obtained by appropriate dilution. Absorption
measurements were carried out at λ = 664 nm, and a linear calibration
curve for MB absorbance at variable concentration was obtained with
a slope of 0.0615 = Abs664nm/[MB]. After 24 h shaking to
achieve equilibrium, the sample powders were separated from the solution
by centrifugation and the residual (MB) was measured using UV–vis
spectroscopy (Varian Cary 100 Scan UV–vis spectrophotometer).
The equilibrium uptake of MB was calculated using eq 2. 2  where Qe (mg g–1) is the MB adsorbed per unit mass of adsorbent, C0 (mM) is the initial dye concentration, Ce (mM) is the residual amount of MB, V (L) is the volume of the MB solution, and m (g) is the weight of the adsorbent.

The GO composite was tested
for its regeneration properties over several adsorption–desorption
cycles with MB, as described in further detail in the Supporting Information.

2.5.2 Kinetic
Uptake Studies of MB
Kinetic
adsorption studies of GO samples cross-linked with LCTS toward MB
as the dye probe in aqueous solution to estimate the sorption capacity
of GO before and after cross-linking with LCTS. Kinetic isotherm profiles
were obtained by plotting Qt versus t using a one-pot method described
elsewhere to account for adsorption processes of nanomaterial sorbents.26 In brief, ca. 100 mg of a powdered sample was
placed into a folded filter paper with both ends sealed before adding
to the MB solution, where it should be noted that the adsorption of
MB by the filter paper was deemed to be negligible overall.27 The sealed filter paper was immersed in a fixed
volume (250 mL) of an aqueous 5 μM MB solution. Aliquots of
MB solution were pipetted (3 mL) at variable time intervals and further
quantified via UV–vis spectrophotometry (Varian Cary 100 Scan
UV–vis spectrophotometer). It is worth mentioning that the
filter paper used in our experiment provides reliable results because
of the fast diffusion processes and negligible adsorption throughout
the experiment.27 The MB adsorption capacity
at variable times for the GO and GO-LCTS materials was calculated
using eq 3 3  where C0 and Ct are
the concentration values
of MB initially and at variable time (t), respectively; V is the solution volume; and m is the
weight of the adsorbent. The adsorption kinetics can be described
by the pseudo-first-order and the pseudo-second-order (PSO) model
to evaluate parameters of the isotherm. In this study, the best-fit
results were obtained by PSO model as given in eq 4 4  where Qt is the amount of solute adsorbed
at time t (mg g–1), Qe is the
amount of solute adsorbed at a pseudo-equilibrium (mg g–1) condition, and k2 is the rate constant
according to the PSO adsorption model. The kinetic sorption parameters
that were deduced from the PSO model in this study provide a comparison
of sorption characteristics of GO and its cross-linked form with LCTS.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Surface
Charge Material Characterization
The point of zero charge
of GO at different pH conditions is an
important indicator of the nature of adsorptive interactions because
the surface charge of the adsorbent phase (GO and GO-LCTS composite)
is likely to affect the adsorption capacity of MB. As shown in Figure 2, the ζ potential
of the GO materials was highly negative, and this charge decreases
continuously with increasing pH from 4 to 10, and is consistent with
previous literature.28 This negative charge
is primarily because of the introduction of various functional groups
(such as −OH and COOH) on the GO surface, which form during
the oxidation of graphite. Such groups become ionized at higher pH
and result in enhanced negative charge.7 Therefore, it is expected that GO and its modified forms will display
favorable affinity with cationic species, especially over the pH range
6–12. GO forms a stable suspension in aqueous solution in the
pH range 6–12 because its ζ potential is below −30
mV. Accordingly, particles with ζ potential lower than −30
mV are strong enough to maintain a stable colloidal solution because
of repulsive forces between them.29 Therefore,
it would be appropriate to run the cross-linking experiment at any
pH above 6. The ζ-potential measurement of GO-LCTS composite
further supports the formation of the GO-LCTS composite. The ζ
potential of GO was −37.5 mV prior to cross-linking with LCTS,
whereas the surface charge of the composite was −2.5 mV.

pH and 295 K.

3.2 SEM Results
Figure 3 shows SEM
micrographs for GO and its cross-linked
form (GO-LCTS). The SEM images depict the graphite starting material
and the synthesized GO, further revealing the layered structure of
these materials. By comparison, the cross-linked GO composites have
wrinkled edges with irregular shapes of dense interconnected layers.
The micrographs reveal that cross-linking of GO alters its regular
layered morphology and surface roughness according to the cross-linker
type. The SEM results indicate that the composites possess higher
surface roughness and porosity when compared with pristine graphite
or GO. These variations in morphology and textural properties provide
support for unique product morphology that occurs upon formation of
a cross-linked composite between GO and LCTS.

materials (GO, graphite) and the
GO-composite material: (a) graphite, (b) GO, and (c) GO-LCTS.

3.3 FTIR
and Raman Spectral Characterization
IR spectroscopy was used
to monitor the changes in surface functional
groups upon the formation of GO from graphite and the structural characterization
of the GO-LCTS composite. The FTIR spectra of the cross-linked composite
material and its precursors (GO and LCTS) are shown in Figure 4a.

Figure 4 FTIR (a) and Raman spectra
(b) of the precursors and GO-LCTS.

First, the GO preparation was characterized by identifying
the
characteristic IR bands for −OH stretching at ∼3200–3700
cm–1, carbonyl groups (C=O) at ca. 1680–1730
cm–1, C=C groups at ca. 1550–1650
cm–1, and epoxy groups at ca. 1230–1350 cm–1. For the IR spectrum of LCTS, characteristic bands
are centered at 1152 and 895 cm–1, corresponding
to signatures assigned to a glucopyranose ring unit, whereas the C=O
stretching vibration of amide I (NHCO) and amide II (N–H) bending
of NH2 is observed at 1650 and 1590 cm–1, respectively. The presence of the band of both precursors (GO and
LCTS) is supported by the similar spectral features of cross-linked
composite materials. A noteworthy observation for the cross-linked
GO composites includes the absence of some bands or changes of intensity
when compared to similar IR bands for the unmodified GO. For instance,
the LCTS glucopyranose band at 895 cm–1 was not
observed in GO-LCTS. The formation of an amide linkage between GO
and LCTS can be demonstrated by the absence of GO peaks at 1730 cm–1, attributed to C=O in the −COOH moiety
of GO, where a greater IR intensity of the amide II band at 1595 cm–1 is observed for cross-linked GO composites. This
provides support for the formation of a linkage between GO and LCTS
as the linker, in agreement with previous reports.30

The Raman spectrum in Figure 4b for GO consists mainly of D- and G-band
signatures
at 1350 and 1580 cm–1. The G band is characteristic
of sp2-hybridized carbon networks of graphene
sheets, whereas the D-band results because of structural imperfections
created by the attachment of oxygen-based functional groups on the
carbon basal plane and its partially disordered structure.31 In contrast to GO, graphite has an almost insignificant
D band because of its highly crystalline structure. However, the intensity
of this Raman band increased, and it became broader upon cross-linking.
Various studies report that the removal of functional groups from
the GO structure results in a greater D/G intensity ratio because
of the onset of defects after reduction and also in self-assembly
of the GO composites.32,33 In this study, cross-linking
of GO led to changes in the D/G intensity ratio, from 0.98 in GO to
1.26 in the cross-linked GO composite. This change in the D/G signal
intensity ratio can be attributed to disruption of the GO layered
structure upon cross-linking with CTS.

3.4 13C Solid NMR Spectral Characterization
The spectra
for pristine GO (Figure 5) present 13C NMR lines for epoxide groups
(∼60 ppm), −C–OH groups (∼70 ppm), and
graphenic group (∼130 ppm), in agreement with a previous report.34 The spectral differences between the cross-linked
GO materials with GO relate to the broadening and 13C spectral
shift variation for the C–OH groups (∼70 ppm) of GO,
along with new spectral signatures ca. 30 and 100 ppm assigned to
the glucosamine and acetylated forms of the co-monomers of LCTS. The
upfield signatures (ca. 20–80 ppm) for GO relate to the alkyl
and alkenic groups. In addition, the appearance of downfield signatures
at ca. 170–180 ppm relate to the presence of carbonyl (acetyl/amide
groups of LCTS and −COOH groups of GO). The two 13C carbonyl signatures for the GO-LCTS composite is related to the
presence of at least two carbonyl groups, one for the acetyl or amide
groups. The NMR results support that cross-linking has occurred, in
agreement with FTIR bands at 1655 and 1595 cm–1.
The above results are in general agreement with 13C NMR
results reported by Mahaninia and Wilson35 for unmodified and cross-linked CTS with different bifunctional
linker systems. The results presented herein provide an example of
the first reported solid NMR spectral results for this type of GO
composite material (Figure 5).

cross-linked composites.

3.5 XRD Structural Characterization
XRD
characterization (Figure 6a) of GO (after oxidation of graphite) and GO-LCTS (after
cross-linking of GO with LCTS) was used to evaluate the structure
of each of the samples, as well as monitor changes in the interlayer
spacing of GO after cross-linking. The XRD pattern of graphite shows
a sharp characteristic peak at 2θ = 31.5°. After the introduction
of oxygen functional groups to the structure of graphite, the graphitic
peak shifts to 2θ = 12.5°, related to the interlayer distance
of 0.72 nm between GO sheets.36

Figure 6 XRD patterns
(a) and TGA curves (b) of GO, precursors (graphite,
LCTS), and GO-LCTS composite.

Also, the XRD pattern of pure LCTS powder displays two broad
peaks
at 2θ = 9.5° and 22.5°, related to the amorphous hydrated
and anhydrous structure of LCTS, respectively.37 In comparison to the GO and LCTS patterns, cross-linked
GO-LCTS shows shifting of the sharp XRD line of GO at 12.5° to
a lower 2θ (10.2°) value with an absence of broad LCTS
peaks. These changes indicate the exfoliation of LCTS into the GO
sheets38 and an increase in the interplanar
distance (0.72–0.87 nm) between GO sheets by the introduction
of LCTS. Although the broadening peak in the XRD pattern of GO-LCTS
suggests slightly lower crystallinity of the GO-LCTS, shifting of
the peak to lower wavenumbers indicates an increase in interlayer
distance of GO sheets by 0.15 nm upon cross-linking with LCTS. This
indicates that LCTS chains are well introduced and strongly bonded
to the oxygen functional groups of GO, while maintaining the stacked
structure of GO sheets in the material.23,39 The higher
crystallinity of the graphite and GO sheets agrees with the layered
cross-sectional morphology observed in SEM images (Figure 3a,b), as compared to the slightly
separated layered cross-section morphology of the GO-LCTS composite
(Figure 3c). The results
for GO and GO-LCTS composites suggest that cross-linking of the GO
sheets is a critical technique to tune GO-based material properties,
including morphology, degree of crystallinity, and interlayer distance
between corresponding GO sheets.

3.6 Thermal
Stability Properties
The
TGA results for the cross-linked GO composite are shown in Figure 6b, where a sharp
thermal decomposition occurs starting near 120 °C for GO, which
results in a total weight loss event for the material. The cross-linked
GO-LCTS material does not show a comparable thermal event, however;
two key thermal events appear at ca. 155 and 250 °C with a weight
loss of 15.6 and 35.4%, respectively. These thermal events for the
GO composite relate to loss of adsorbed or free water and decomposition
of GO oxygen functionalities and the LCTS backbone that yields degradation
of the GO-LCTS framework structure. The TGA results confirm that the
GO-LCTS structure has greater stability over GO as shown by its stability
upon heating to the upper-temperature limit (500 °C).

3.7 Solvent Swelling and Dye Sorption Properties
Equilibrium
swelling properties of GO-LCTS composite and the precursors
are listed in Table 1. The results indicate that graphite and LCTS have the least swelling,
whereas GO and the cross-linked GO composite (GO-LCTS) display greater
swelling in water. The GO-LCTS composite has reduced swelling relative
to pristine GO that may relate to the fewer ionic sites (−COOH)
as a result of amide bond formation because of cross-linking, in agreement
with the IR and NMR spectral results above.

Composite and Precursors (Graphite and GO)
material	swelling

graphite	510	
LCTS	345	
GO	9745	
GO-LCTS	6500	
The greater swelling of GO
is attributed to its highly hydrophilic
nature imparted by its polar functional groups (e.g., −OH,
−COOH, etc.). By contrast, cross-linking of GO with LCTS decreases
the overall hydrophilic character of the composite that may alter
water infiltration and hydration properties of the system. The denser
arrangement of the GO-LCTS 3D framework (according to SEM results)
is expected to contribute steric hydration effects that differ from
the 2D nature of GO because of the greater abundance and accessibility
of polar functional groups in pristine GO. Differences in the hydrophilic
character and network structure of GO-LCTS and GO provide an account
for the water swelling properties of these materials.

3.7.1 Equilibrium Dye Uptake of MB
The
MB sorption behavior of the GO and GO-LCTS adsorbents in aqueous solution
was analyzed by fitting the adsorption isotherm results for uptake
of MB at variable concentration by various models (Langmuir, Freundlich,
and Sips isotherms). The Langmuir model (eq 5) describes monolayer sorption for the adsorbate–adsorbent
system. By comparison, Freundlich and Sips models describe the relationship
for adsorbent–adsorbate systems with variable adsorption sites
(eqs 6 and 7). The Sips model accounts for Langmuir and Freundlich behavior,
where the maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbate (Qm) onto the adsorbent surface can be estimated. 5   6   7  

In eq 5, Qe is the equilibrium
uptake of dye per unit mass of adsorbent, Ce is the residual equilibrium concentration of dye, and K1 is the Langmuir adsorption affinity constant. In eq 6, Kf is the Freundlich adsorption capacity constant and nf relates to the intensity of adsorption, where
1/nf < 1.0 represents highly favorable
adsorption, whereas 1/nf > 2 denotes
unfavorable
adsorption process, where 1/nf < 1
obtained for both GO and GO-LCTS materials showed favorable adsorption
for these adsorbents. In eq 7, Ks is the Sips adsorption constant
that relates to the adsorption energy, and ns indicates surface heterogeneity of the sorbent, where Ce is defined as in eq 5.

The adsorption isotherms for MB onto
GO and GO-LCTS are shown in Figure 7, where the best-fit
sorption parameters obtained by the Sips model are listed in Table 2, where favorable
correlation coefficients (R2) are obtained
(R2 ≈ 0.960–0.972). The
MB adsorption results for GO and GO-LCTS material adopt behavior described
by monolayer adsorption onto homogeneous adsorption sites. The latter
is supported by values of ns near unity
(ns = 0.96) for the surface cross-linked
GO (GO-LCTS). The maximum adsorption capacity (Qm) of MB, according to the Sips model for GO-LCTS (Qm = 402.6 mg g–1) exceeds
that for pristine GO (Qm = 286.9 mg g–1) and LCTS (Qm = 12.0
mg g–1; data not shown here). The adsorption capacity
of MB by GO-LCTS reported here is notably higher than a number of
reported values for other graphene-based adsorbents (cf. Table S1; Supporting Information).

Figure 7 (A) Isotherm sorption results for MB with GO and GO-LCTS sorbents,
and (B) decolorization of MB before and after the sorption process
with GO-LCTS.

The Qm value for cross-linked GO increased
by 115 mg g–1 compared to unmodified GO, reflecting
the enhanced adsorption properties of the composite. The superior Qm values may relate to several factors: (i)
alteration of the surface functional groups of GO-LCTS provides additional
adsorption sites that favor adsorption, and (ii) cross-linking of
GO with LCTS contributes cooperative sorbent–MB dye interactions
because of changes in the macromolecular structure, along with alteration
of the hydrophile–lipophile balance of the composite over GO.
It should be noted that pristine LCTS has negligible uptake of MB,
whereas the GO-LCTS material has notably higher uptake of MB. There
is a strong binding interaction between MB (cationic dye) and the
GO-based materials because of the presence of polar/charged functional
groups with Lewis base character on the surface of these materials.
MB shows a favorable binding with GO, whereas the GO cross-linked
material shows much greater uptake of MB after cross-linking with
LCTS. The higher adsorption capacity of GO-LCTS is attributed to its
composite structure, which serves to disperse GO and prevent its aggregation
in aqueous media. The favorable dispersion of GO through the composite
lends to its large surface area and microporous structure that is
critical for adsorption applications.23 The interconnected network structure and higher interlayer distance
between GO sheets in the GO-LCTS composite (as shown in XRD result Figure 6a) allow adsorbate
molecules (MB) to diffuse into the active sites of GO-LCTS.23 Additionally, both GO and LCTS are known to
remove dyes via electrostatic interactions.40,41 Therefore, the combined effect of these precursors contribute excellent
sorption properties that enhance the overall sorption capacity of
the GO-LCTS composite.

The high removal efficiency of cross-linked
GO samples is evidenced
by Figure 7b. At an
initial MB dye concentration from 100 to 1000 μM, variable decolorization
occurs after the adsorption process relative to the initially turbid
colored solutions prior to adsorption.

3.7.2 Kinetic
Dye Uptake of MB
The kinetic
uptake performance of GO and GO-LCTS materials are shown in Figure 8, where the MB adsorption
capacity increased quickly for both GO and GO-LCTS sorbent materials
in the first 50 min and decreased slowly thereafter. The rapid MB
uptake is contributed by the negatively charged adsorption sites accessible
on the sorbent surface. By contrast, the slower uptake is because
of the greater adsorption site occupancy as the surface sites become
more saturated with MB at later stages of the isotherm profile. Consequently,
preliminary MB adsorption may avoid the diffusion of further species
onto the dense GO-LCTS structure, resulting in longer equilibrium
times.

Figure 8 Kinetic uptake profile of MB with GO and GO cross-linked composite
material, where the solid lines represent the best fit by the PSO
model (see eq 4).

Table 3 represents the kinetic
adsorption parameters for sorbent
materials with MB over a 250 min interval, in which the PSO kinetic
model provided reasonable fitting results based on favorable correlation
coefficients (R2), where R2 ≈ 0.987–0.996. According to the obtained
kinetic parameters (k2 and Qe), the GO-LCTS material has greater uptake over pristine
GO based on the kinetic profiles. The value of Qe (μmol g–1) and the PSO rate constant
values (k2; g/μmol min) for the
sorbent materials increased after cross-linking: GO (4.17 μmol
g–1) < GO-LTS (5.10 μmol g–1), and GO (0.004 g/μmol min) < GO-LCTS (0.019 g/μmol
min), respectively. These trends in uptake are consistent with the
results for the TGA and spectral characterization (FTIR, 13C NMR, and Raman) for the GO-LCTS material. Also, a previous report17 indicates that the intraparticle diffusion and
external diffusion play an important role in the adsorption kinetics.42 It has been previously reported that the structure
of monolith aerogels containing CTS is affected by the addition of
GO. This leads to considerable changes in the morphological characteristics
of both CTS and GO43 that parallel observations
noted in the SEM results for GO-LCTS in Figure 3. Changes in the macromolecular structure
of GO and its composite form are evidenced according to the change
in surface area upon swelling, sorption, and storage capacity,43 as similarly noted in the case of water swelling
or strong interactions with gaseous species.44 Additionally, cross-linking GO with LCTS facilitated the nano-dispersion
of components that yield more surface active sites for adsorption
that enhance the adsorption capacity of GO-LCTS, as outlined below(cf. Figure 8).

Table 3 PSO Kinetic Model Values for GO-Based
Materials at 295 K
sorbent material	Qm (μmol/g)	k2 (g/μmol min)	R2	
GO-LCTS	5.10	0.019	0.987	
GO	4.17	0.004	0.996	
The greater kinetic
uptake of the composite material provides support
that cooperative effects occur because of amide bond formation between
GO and LCTS that may yield secondary adsorption sites for MB adsorption.
Also, there are more active adsorption sites according to the increasing Qe values as the GO becomes cross-linked with
LCTS. The decreasing kinetic trend of all sorbent materials also suggest
that diffusion of MB through the pore network of the sorbent materials
decreased with increasing contact time between sorbent where MB, along
with a decreasing number of available adsorption sites over the kinetic
profile as time increases.

4 Conclusions
GO and its cross-linked composites were synthesized by cross-linking
LCTS and GO to yield a framework material. The materials were systematically
characterized by several complementary methods to affirm the structure
of the GO-LCTS composite, where MB removal efficacy was used to study
the adsorption properties of the materials at equilibrium and kinetic
conditions. The FTIR and 13C NMR spectra are reported for
the first time for GO-LTCS composites that provide support for the
formation of amide linkages and a unique framework structure relative
to the 2D layered structure of GO. The greater surface roughness of
the GO cross-linked composite parallels the variable morphology revealed
by SEM that is also supported by the concomitant changes in thermal
stability revealed by TGA results. The GO composite displays improved
adsorbent properties over GO that are suitable for wastewater decontamination,
as shown by its effective MB removal at equilibrium and kinetic conditions.
The monolayer adsorption capacity (Qm)
of the GO-LCTS material with MB was 402.6 mg g–1, which far exceeds that of pristine GO and CTS. The development
GO-based composites derived via biopolymer cross-linking display enhanced
adsorption properties with improved stability for reuse in multiple
adsorption–desorption processes. This strategy extends the
field of application of GO due to the facile nature and versatility
of the cross-linking approach for tuning the structure of GO, along
with the unique adsorption properties of cross-linked GO–CTS.
This work demonstrates the potential utility of GO–CTS composites
as versatile candidates in solid phase extraction for potential applications
in wastewater decontamination, advanced nanomedicine, and drug delivery.45−48
