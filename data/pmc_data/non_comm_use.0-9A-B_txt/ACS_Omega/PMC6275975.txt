Molecular
dynamics simulation data for a variety of binary guest
mixtures (H2/CO2, Ne/CO2, CH4/CO2, CO2/N2, H2/CH4, H2/Ar, CH4/Ar, Ar/Kr, Ne/Ar, CH4/C2H6, CH4/C3H8, C2H6C3H8, CH4/nC4H10, and CH4/nC5H11) in zeolites (MFI, BEA, ISV, FAU (all-silica),
NaY, NaX, LTA, CHA, DDR) and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)
(IRMOF-1, CuBTC, MgMOF-74) show that the Maxwell–Stefan (M–S)
diffusivities, Đ1, Đ2, Đ12, are strongly
dependent on the molar loadings. The main aim of this article is to
develop a fundamental basis for describing the loading dependence
of M–S diffusivities. Using the ideal adsorbed solution theory,
a thermodynamically rigorous definition of the occupancy, θ,
is derived; this serves as a convenient proxy for the spreading pressure,
π, and provides the correct metric to describe the loading dependence
of diffusivities. Configurational-bias Monte Carlo simulations of
the unary adsorption isotherms are used for the calculation of the
spreading pressure, π, and occupancy, θ. The M–S
diffusivity, Đi, of either constituent in binary mixtures has the same value as
that for unary diffusion, provided the comparison is made at the same
θ. Furthermore, compared at the same value of θ, the M–S
diffusivity Đi of
any component in a mixture does not depend on it partner species.
The Đi versus θ
dependence is amenable to simple interpretation using lattice-models.
The degree of correlations, defined by the ratio Đ1/Đ12, that characterizes
mixture diffusion shows a linear increase with occupancy θ,
implying that correlations become increasingly important as pore saturation
conditions are approached.

1 Introduction
Ordered crystalline microporous materials such as zeolites (alumino-silicates),
metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), and zeolitic imidazolate frameworks
have wide applications as catalysts, adsorbents, and as perm-selective
layers in membrane separations.1−8 The design and development of catalytic and separation processes
requires reliable and accurate models to describe intracrystalline
diffusion of mixtures of guest molecules.3,7,9 Intracrystalline diffusion of reactants
and products invariably exert a strong influence on the conversion
and selectivity of catalyzed reactions.10−12 For mixture separations
in a fixed-bed adsorber, intraparticle diffusion limitations cause
distended breakthrough characteristics and usually lead to diminished
separation effectiveness.13,14 Diffusional effects
may become strong enough to over-ride the influence of mixture adsorption
equilibrium and become the prime driver in fixed-bed separations.14−18 The selectivities in membrane separations are governed by a combination
of mixture adsorption equilibrium and mixture diffusion characteristics.4,19−21

It is widely recognized that the most convenient
and practical
approach to modeling n-component mixture diffusion
is to adopt the Maxwell–Stefan (M–S) formulation that
relates the intracrystalline molar fluxes Ni to the chemical potential gradients6,7,9 1  where R is the gas
constant
(=8.314 J mol–1 K–1), ρ
represents the framework density of the microporous crystalline material,
and the component loadings qi are defined in terms of moles per kg of framework. The xi in eq 1 are the component mole fractions of the adsorbed
phase within the micropores 2  

The Đi characterize
species i–wall interactions in the broadest
sense. The Đij are
exchange coefficients representing interaction between components i with component j. At the molecular level,
the Đij reflect
how the facility for transport of species i correlates
with that of species j. Conformity with the Onsager
reciprocal relations demands the symmetry constraint 3  

Specifically, for a binary mixture,
that is n =
2, the M–S eq 1 can be re-written to evaluate the fluxes Ni explicitly by defining a matrix [Λ] 4  

Combining eq 1 with 4 we
derive the following explicit expression for
calculation of the elements of the 2 × 2 dimensional square matrix
[Λ] 5  

The ratios Đ1/Đ12, and Đ2/Đ12 quantify the degrees
of correlation. The magnitude
of Đ1, relative to that of Đ12, determines the extent to which the
flux of species 1 is influenced by the chemical potential gradient
of species 2. The larger the degree of correlation, Đ1/Đ12, the stronger
is the influence of diffusional “coupling”. Generally
speaking, the more-strongly-adsorbed-tardier partner species will
have the effect of slowing down the less-strongly-adsorbed-more-mobile
partner in the mixture.

The elements of [Λ] cannot be
determined directly from experimental
measurements. However, Λij are directly
accessible from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations22 by monitoring the individual molecular displacements 6  

In this expression, ni and nj represent the
number of molecules of species i and j, respectively, and rl,i(t) is the position of molecule l of species i at any time t. The three M–S diffusivities Đ1, Đ2, and Đ12 can be backed out from the MD-simulated values of Λij for the binary mixture; detailed procedures
are provided in the Supporting Information accompanying this publication. As illustration, Figure 1 presents the M–S diffusivities
for four different mixture/host combinations: CO2/N2 in MFI, CH4/Ar in BEA, Ne/Ar in CHA, and CH4/C2H6 in IRMOF-1. It is noteworthy that
the M–S diffusivities are not constant but vary with the total
mixture loading qt = q1 + q2.

Figure 1 M–S diffusivities Đ1, Đ2, and Đ12, backed out from MD-simulated
values of Λij, for equimolar (q1 = q2) binary mixtures:
(a) CO2(1)/N2(2) in MFI, (b) CH4(1)/Ar(2)
in BEA, (c) Ne(1)/Ar(2) in
CHA, and (d) CH4(1)/C2H6(2) in IRMOF-1.
The x-axis is the total mixture loading qt = q1 + q2. Also plotted are the MD simulation data for the corresponding
unary diffusivities.

Formally speaking, the M–S eqs 1 and 4 serve only to
define the
M–S diffusivities Đ1, Đ2, and Đ12; for practical applications, we need reliable procedures for estimation
of these diffusivities. An important, persuasive advantage of the
M–S formulation is that the M–S diffusivities Đ1 and Đ2 for mixture diffusion may be identified with the corresponding M–S
diffusivities for unary diffusion that are more easily accessible
from either experiments or MD simulations.23 To test this hypothesis, the MD-simulated values of the unary diffusivities
are also plotted in Figure 1. For the four sets, there is reasonably good agreement between
the unary diffusivities and the corresponding values in the mixture.

For binary mixtures of guest constituents that have significantly
large differences in saturation capacities, the agreement between
the M–S diffusivities in the mixture is not as good as portrayed
in Figure 1, especially
as pore saturation conditions are approached. This is evidenced by
the data presented in Figure 2 for CH4/H2 in MFI, CH4/C3H8 in BEA, CH4/C2H6 in NaY zeolite, CH4/nC4H10 in IRMOF-1, CO2/H2 in IRMOF-1, and
CO2/H2 in CuBTC. The departures between two
sets of data on the M–S diffusivities Đ1 and Đ2 plotted in Figure 2 stem from the fact
that the comparisons on the basis of total molar loadings are not
based on a sound fundamental footing, as we shall demonstrate in this
article.

Figure 2 M–S diffusivities Đ1 and Đ2, backed out from MD-simulated values
of Λij, for equimolar (q1 = q2) binary mixtures: (a)
CH4(1)/H2(2) in MFI, (b) CH4(1)/C3H8(2) in BEA, (c) CH4(1)/C2H6(2) in NaY zeolite, (d) CH4(1)/nC4H10(2) in IRMOF-1, (e) CO2(1)/H2(2) in IRMOF-1, and (f) CO2(1)/H2(2)
in CuBTC. The x-axis is the total mixture loading qt = q1 + q2. Also plotted are the MD simulation data for
the corresponding unary diffusivities.

This article has fourfold objectives. First, using the ideal
adsorbed
solution theory (IAST) of Myers and Prausnitz,24 we develop arguments to demonstrate that comparisons of
the diffusivities in the mixture with the constituent unary diffusivities
need to be based on equality of spreading pressures, and not the total
molar loadings. Second, we derive an expression for the occupancy,
θ, as a function of the spreading pressure; the derived θ
serves as a convenient and practical proxy for the spreading pressures,
and is the appropriate parameter to be used as x-axes
in Figures 1 and 2. The third objective is to show that unary M–S
diffusivities, Đ1 and Đ2, when compared at the same occupancy θ are in
good agreement with those determined from the MD simulations for binary
mixtures, not just for the data in Figures 1 and 2 but for a wide
variety of guest mixtures (H2/CO2, Ne/CO2, CH4/CO2, CO2/N2, H2/CH4, H2/Ar, CH4/Ar,
Ar/Kr, Ne/Ar, CH4/C2H6, CH4/C3H8, C2H6C3H8, CH4/nC4H10, and CH4/nC5H11) in zeolites (MFI, BEA, ISV, FAU (all-silica), NaY, NaX,
LTA, CHA, DDR) and MOFs (IRMOF-1, CuBTC, MgMOF-74). The fourth objective
is to show that degrees of correlations, Đ1/Đ12, and Đ2/Đ12, are linearly
dependent on the occupancy θ.

MOFs considered and analyzed in this article, (b) configurational-bias

2 Thermodynamics
of Mixture Adsorption
The thermodynamics of mixture adsorption
has an important bearing
on the diffusion characteristics within microporous crystalline host
materials because the guest constituent molecules exist entirely in
the adsorbed phase. The Gibbs adsorption equation3 in differential form is27,28 7  

In eq 7, A represents the surface
area per kg of framework, qi is the molar loading, μi is the molar chemical potential, and π is
the spreading pressure.

At phase equilibrium, equating the component
chemical potentials,
μi, in the adsorbed phase and in
the bulk fluid phase mixture, we write 8  

Briefly, the basic equation of IAST of Myers and Prausnitz24 is the analogue of Raoult’s law for vapor–liquid
equilibrium, that is 9  where xi is the mole fraction in the adsorbed phase defined
by eq 2, and Pi0 is the pressure for sorption of every component i, which yields the same spreading pressure, π, for
each of
the pure components, as that for the mixture 10  where qi0(f) is the pure component
adsorption isotherm. The units of , also called the adsorption potential,29 are mol kg–1. Eq 10 suggests that the fundamentally
correct procedure for comparing the unary M–S diffusivities
and those representing the mixture diffusion characteristics must
be done on the basis of equal adsorption potentials, that is a proxy
for the spreading pressure.

For the simplest scenario in which
the binary mixture is made up
of components, whose unary isotherms are described by the 1-site Langmuir
isotherm, with equal saturation capacities 11  we derive the following expression
for the
mixture occupancy (detailed derivations are provided in the Supporting Information) 12  

For each of the guest/host combinations
investigated in this study,
CBMC simulations23,25,26,30 of the unary adsorption isotherms were performed
in order to determine the unary isotherms. In every case, the unary
isotherm characteristics required use of the more general dual-Langmuir–Freundlich
model to describe the unary isotherms 13  

The dual-site Langmuir–Freundlich
model fit parameters for
every guest/host combination is tabulated in the Supporting Information accompanying this publication. Analytic
integration of eq 10, in conjunction with eq 13, yields 14  

As illustration, Figure 3a presents IAST calculations of the adsorption
potential plotted
as a function of the molar loading for equimolar (q1 = q2) binary CO2(1)/H2(2) mixtures in IRMOF-1 at 300 K. For molar loadings
lower than 25 mol kg–1, the value of  is the same for each component as for the
mixture. However, for molar loadings >25 mol kg–1, the equality in the spreading pressures as demanded by eq 10 can only be achieved
at different molar loadings of the unary components and the mixture.
Indeed, if the MD data for the M–S diffusivities are plotted
as a function of , the two sets of M–S diffusivities
are in good agreement with each other; see Figure 3b. Comparison of Figure 2e and 3b underscores
the need for a proper thermodynamic comparison yardstick for diffusivities.

Figure 3 (a) Adsorption
potential plotted as a function of the molar loading
for equimolar (q1 = q2) binary CO2(1)/H2(2) mixtures
in IRMOF-1 at 300 K. (b) Comparison of the unary M–S diffusivities Đ1 and Đ2 with those backed out from mixture MD simulations, plotted as a
function of the adsorption potential.

From Figure 3a,
it is to be noted that the adsorption potential  increases exponentially with the molar
loading as the pores become increasingly saturated. Consequently,
it is much more convenient in practice to compare the diffusivities
on the basis of occupancy, θ, defined by the following generalization
of eq 12 15  

Eq 15 degenerates
to eq 12 for the 1-site
Langmuir isotherm; the occupancy θ is to be viewed as a convenient,
and practical, proxy for the spreading pressure, π.

3 M–S Diffusivities as a Function of Occupancy
The
same set of MD simulation data in Figure 2 are plotted in Figure 4 with the occupancy θ as x-axes. In each of the six guest/host combinations, there is much
closer agreement between the unary diffusivities and those characterizing
mixture diffusion. Comparisons analogous to those presented in Figure 4 are presented in
the Supporting Information for 70 different
mixture/host combinations. The same conclusions drawn from Figure 4 hold in most, but
not all, of these cases. There are two scenarios in which the M–S
diffusivity in the mixture deviates to a significant extent from the
corresponding unary M–S diffusivity. For water/methanol and
water/ethanol diffusion in MFI and FAU zeolites, the M–S diffusivities
of either guest molecule in the mixture are significantly lower than
the corresponding unary diffusivity because of the molecular clustering
caused by hydrogen bonding.31 Similar departures
between unary M–S diffusivities and those characterizing mixture
diffusion may also be expected for highly polar guest molecules such
CHN, CH2N2, CH2O, and C2H4O. For diffusion of CO2-bearing mixtures
in cage-type zeolites such as LTA, DDR, and ERI, CO2 gets
preferentially, and strongly, adsorbed at the narrow windows of these
zeolites, hindering the diffusion of partner molecules. As a consequence,
the M–S diffusivity of the partner molecule falls significantly
below the corresponding value of the unary M–S diffusivity.
Detailed analysis and explanation of the hindering effects caused
by segregated adsorption effects are provided in earlier works.32−34

Figure 4 M–S
diffusivities Đ1 and Đ2 backed out from MD-simulated values
of Λij, for equimolar (q1 = q2) binary mixtures: (a)
CH4(1)/H2(2) in MFI, (b) CH4(1)/C3H8(2) in BEA, (c) CH4(1)/C2H6(2) in NaY zeolite, (d) CH4(1)/nC4H10(2) in IRMOF-1, (e) CO2(1)/H2(2) in IRMOF-1, and (f) CO2(1)/H2(2)
in CuBTC. The x-axis is the occupancy θ defined
by eq 15.

A further, not fully appreciated, advantage of
the M–S formulation
is that the M–S diffusivity of any species in a mixture is
also not influenced by the choice of the partner molecules. To illustrate
this, Figure 5 provides
data on the M–S diffusivity of CO2, Đi, determined from MD simulation data
for diffusion of a variety of binary mixtures of CO2 and
different partner species in six different host materials (MFI, FAU,
LTA, CHA, IRMOF-1, CuBTC). For any host material, we note that the
diffusivity of CO2 in a binary mixture is practically independent
of the partner species. Furthermore, when compared at the same occupancy,
θ, the values of Đi are nearly the same in the mixture as those determined for
unary diffusion, indicated by the open symbols in Figure 5. Similar conclusions hold
for the M–S diffusivity of CH4 in binary mixtures
containing different partner species, in six different host materials
(FAU, NaY, NaX, BEA, IRMOF-1, CuBTC); see Figure 6.

data for diffusion
of a variety of equimolar (q1 = q2) binary mixtures of CO2 and different
partner species in (a) MFI, (b) FAU (all silica), (c) LTA, (d) CHA,
(e) IRMOF-1, and (f) CuBTC. The x-axes represent
the fractional θ defined by eq 15. Also shown in open symbols are the MD simulations
of Đi, for unary
CO2 diffusion.

of a variety of equimolar (q1 = q2) binary mixtures of CH4 and different
partner species in (a) FAU (all silica), (b) NaY (48 Al), (c) NaX
(86 Al), (d) BEA, (e) IRMOF-1, and (f) CuBTC. The x-axes represent the fractional θ defined by eq 15. Also shown in open symbols are
the MD simulations of Đi, for unary CH4 diffusion.

Figure 7 presents
the data on the M–S diffusivity, Đi, of Ar determined from MD simulations for
diffusion of a variety of binary mixtures of Ar and different partner
species in MFI, FAU, and IRMOF-1. The M–S diffusivity of Ar
is the same whether it diffuses on its own or in the presence of any
other partner molecule.

Figure 7 M–S diffusivity, Đi, of Ar-determined MD simulation data
for diffusion of a variety
of equimolar (q1 = q2) binary mixtures of Ar and different partner species in (a)
MFI, (b) FAU-Si, and (c) IRMOF-1. The x-axes represent
the fractional θ defined by eq 15. Also shown in open symbols are the MD simulations
of Đi, for unary
Ar diffusion.

Use of the generalized
definition of occupancy θ (determined
using eq 15) as a comparison
metric also allows a simpler description of the occupancy dependence
of the M–S diffusivities; for example, the M–S diffusivity
of CO2 in MFI, FAU, and CHA (see Figure 5a,b,d), CH4 in FAU, NaY, NaX, and BEA zeolites
(see Figure 6a–d),
and Ar in FAU (see Figure 7b) conform reasonably well with a simple lattice model in
which the hopping frequency of molecular jumps is proportional to
the number of unoccupied sites. 16  

The success of the simple model in these cases is directly
ascribable
to the fact that the occupancy defined by eq 15 takes proper account of all of the isotherm
characteristics, such as inflections, that influence diffusivities.

For the other guest/host combinations, the Đi versus θ dependences are more
complicated and require models such as that of Reed and Ehrlich35 that account for molecule–molecule interactions.36−38

4 Degree of Correlations
Figure 8 shows MD
simulation data for the degree of correlations, Đ1/Đ12, for diffusion
of equimolar binary mixtures H2/CO2, N2/CO2, CH4/Ar, Ne/Ar, CH4/C2H6, and CH4/C3H8 in a
variety of host materials. For any guest/host combination, Đ1/Đ12 is seen to increase linearly as the pore occupancy increases; correlation
effects are enhanced as the micropores become increasingly occupied.
The degree of correlations is weakest in cage-type structures such
as CHA, DDR, ERI, and LTA that have narrow eight-ring windows in the
3.6–4.2 Å size range. In such structures, the windows
allow the intercage hopping of only one molecule at any given instant
of time; consequently, the jumps are practically uncorrelated.39 On the other hand, correlations are strongest
in one-dimensional channel structures (e.g., BTP-COF, MgMOF-74, NiMOF-74),
intersecting channels (e.g., MFI, BEA, ISV), and “open”
structures (e.g., IRMOF-1, CuBTC, FAU, NaY, NaX) consisting of large
cages separated by wide windows.39 Procedures
for estimation of the degree of correlations are provided in the Supporting Information.

Figure 8 MD simulation data for
the degree of correlations, Đ1/Đ12, for diffusion
of equimolar (q1 = q2) binary mixtures (a) H2/CO2, (b) N2/CO2, (c) CH4/Ar, (d) Ne/Ar, (e) CH4/C2H6, and (f) CH4/C3H8 at 300 K in a variety of host materials. The x-axes represent the fractional θ defined by eq 15. Procedures for estimation
of the degrees of correlation are discussed in Chapter 10 of the Supporting Information.

5 Conclusions
Using the IAST theory of Myers
and Prausnitz,24 a thermodynamically rigorous
definition of the occupancy,
θ, has been derived (see eq 15), which is a convenient proxy for the spreading pressure,
π. The M–S diffusivity Đi of any component in the mixture has the same value
as that for unary diffusion if the comparison is made at the same
θ. Compared at the same value of θ, the M–S diffusivity Đi of any component in
a mixture does not depend on it partner species. The Đi versus θ dependence is amenable
to simple interpretation using lattice-models such as that of Reed
and Ehrlich.35−38 The degree of correlations, Đ1/Đ12, exhibits a simple linear
dependence on the occupancy θ, implying that correlations become
increasingly important as pore saturation conditions are approached.
