The Ho3+/Yb3+-codoped YVO4 phosphors
have been synthesized by three different techniques (viz., solution
combustion, sol–gel, and solid-state reaction techniques).
X-ray diffraction patterns confirm the formation of a pure phase in
the samples synthesized by all of the three methods; however, the
average crystallite sizes in the three cases are different. The crystallite
size increases if they are heated to higher temperature. The particle
sizes are measured by scanning electron microscopy, which shows an
increase in particle size with increasing the calcination temperature.
The vibrational behavior of all of the three synthesized phosphor
samples is studied by the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) technique.
The UV–vis absorption measurements give a large number of bands
in all of the three samples prepared by three different methods. The
upconversion (UC) emissions in all three samples have been monitored
using a 980 nm diode laser. It gives an intense red emission in all
of the three samples. Upconversion emission intensity is more prominent
in the phosphor sample synthesized by the sol–gel technique
and heated at 1473 K. The enhancement in UC emission intensity is
well understood by the shape and size of the particles and also confirmed
by the FTIR and UV–vis measurements. It is interesting to note
that whereas UC measurements give red and weak green emissions, downshifting
(DS) measurements show intense green, weak red, and broad blue emissions
on UV excitation (323 nm). The DS behavior shows the same characteristics
of the enhancement in overall emission. Overall, the phosphor sample
synthesized by the sol–gel method gives better results in upconversion
and downshifting behaviors when heated at 1473 K.

1 Introduction
Rare-earth-doped materials
have wide applications in different
fields such as in the development of new lasers, light-emitting diodes,
display devices, plasma panels, solar panels, for bioimaging, as a
sensor, etc.1−8 The upconversion (UC) emission from rare-earth-doped materials on
near-infrared (NIR) excitation is often used in the field of life
sciences to get valuable information as the biomaterials do not degrade
by weak NIR radiation. Some of these rare-earth-doped materials show
dual-mode emissions in which both upconversion (UC) and downshifting
(DS) emissions are observed.9,10 Rare earth ions doped
in these act as an activator, which shows upconversion emission on NIR pumping and downconversion
on UV/visible pumping. The hosts that have been used are generally
glass, polymer, inorganic or organic phosphor, composites, etc. In
this work, we have used an inorganic material as a host. The host
materials and their preparation method, purity, and quality play a
very important role in luminescence. The host material may be a self-activated
host or non-self-activated host. The self-activated host materials
absorb the incident UV light and give broadband emission in the UV–visible
region, which sensitizes not only the rare earth (activator) but also
sometimes the other activators (if used) doped in it. YVO4 is such a self-activated host that gives intense broad emission
in the 350–550 nm region on UV excitation. The rare earth ion
(Ho3+) doped in YVO4 absorbs this radiation
and gives its own intense emission in the green region. The phonon
frequency of this host is low (≈800 cm–1),
which is suitable for better UC emission behavior. The UC emission
intensity may be enhanced significantly by codoping of the Yb3+ ion with Ho3+ in YVO4 phosphor.10

As mentioned above, the optical emission
behavior of an activator
in a host strongly depends on its synthesis procedure. It is well
known that the shape and size of the particles can be controlled by
using different techniques.11,12 It is also reported
that on heating/calcination at higher temperatures, the average particle
size of the synthesized phosphors increases,13,14 which shows an interesting effect on the optical emission behaviors,
viz., UC as well as downshifting. Silver et al.15 have reported that the increase in particle size increases
the UC emission efficiency. Wang et al.16 have also suggested that the luminescence property enhances with
the increase in the particle size.

There are several methods
for the synthesis of rare-earth-doped
phosphor materials. In the present work, three different methods (viz.,
solution combustion, sol–gel, and solid-state reaction methods)
have been used for the synthesis of Ho3+/Yb3+-codoped YVO4 phosphor. The samples are synthesized by
combustion and sol–gel methods. Parts of these samples are
heated at 973 and 1473 K. At the next step, Ho3+/Yb3+-codoped YVO4 phosphor is prepared at 1473 K using
the solid-state reaction method. The optical as well as the structural
properties of all of the samples are compared. It is found that the
phosphor sample synthesized by the sol–gel technique shows
better optical behavior than the phosphor samples synthesized by combustion
or solid-state reaction methods. Such types of comparative studies
of both structural and optical properties in phosphors synthesized
by different techniques are rarely reported to the best of our knowledge.

In the present work, an enhancement in overall emission (UC and
DS) has been observed and it is analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD),
scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) and UV–vis–NIR measurements. The intense red
emission observed in the upconversion process is applicable in bioimaging.
In brief, the phosphor sample synthesized by the sol–gel technique
shows better optical properties than those of the samples prepared
by the other two methods.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structural Morphology
Figure 1a shows the X-ray diffraction
pattern of the YVO4:Ho3+,Yb3+ phosphor
samples synthesized by two different methods (i.e., combustion and
sol–gel) and heated at 973 K. The XRD patterns of these two
samples are identical and match well with JCPDS file no. 72–0274
in the tetragonal system with cell parameters a =
7.100 Å, c = 6.270 Å, and α = β
= γ, which confirms the pure phase formation of the prepared
samples. The sharp and intense peaks of XRD patterns show the pure
crystalline nature of the synthesized sample. The average crystallite
size (D) of crystals grown is calculated using the
Scherrer equation19  where k = 0.89, λ is
the wavelength of Cu Kα radiation, β is the corrected
full width at half-maximum of the diffraction peak in radians, and
θ is the diffraction angle. The values of average crystallite
sizes of phosphors synthesized by combustion and sol–gel are
39.2 and 53.8 nm, respectively. The average crystallite size is larger
in the phosphor synthesized by sol–gel than that by the combustion
method.

Figure 1 (a) X-ray diffraction patterns of YVO4:Ho3+,Yb3+ synthesized by (I) combustion and (II) sol–gel
methods at 973 K; (b) XRD patterns of phosphors synthesized by (I)
combustion, (II) sol–gel, and (III) solid-state reaction methods
at 1473 K.

A comparative study of the crystalline
behavior of phosphors synthesized
by three different methods (i.e., combustion, sol–gel, and
solid-state reaction methods) has been performed and is shown in Figure 1b. On heating the
phosphors synthesized by combustion and sol–gel methods also
at 1473 K, the crystallinity increases. The crystallinity is more
for the phosphor synthesized by the solid-state reaction method than
by the other two methods. The crystallite sizes of YVO4:Ho3+,Yb3+ phosphors synthesized by combustion,
sol–gel, and solid-state reaction methods are 57.62, 65.43,
and 55.42 nm, respectively.

Figure 2 shows the
SEM images of the YVO4:Ho3+,Yb3+ phosphors
synthesized by combustion and sol–gel methods. The histograms
for the particle size distributions are shown in Figure 3, and the average particle
size has been calculated using these histograms. The surface particles
are random in shape, as shown in Figure 2a. However, the particles are well separated
to each other and the average particle size is nearly equal to 0.54
μm for the YVO4:Ho3+,Yb3+ phosphor
synthesized by the combustion method at 973 K (see Figure 3a). When the phosphor sample
is heated at 1473 K, the surface particles are modified toward a nearly
spherical shape and the average size is increased to around 1.90 μm
(see Figure 2c).

Figure 2b shows
the SEM image of the YVO4:Ho3+,Yb3+ phosphor synthesized via the sol–gel method at 973 K, in
which the surface particles are again random in shape and agglomerated
together. The average particle size is around 0.59 μm. The particles
on the surface are modified toward a purely spherical shape on heating at 1473 K, and the average size
is nearly 1.94 μm. This modification in shape and increase in
particles size with an increase in temperature may be responsible
for the enhancement of the overall emission as discussed in upcoming
sections.

A comparative study of SEM images of all of the three
samples synthesized
by three different methods is shown in Figure 4. From the figure, it can be seen that the
surface morphology of the particles of the phosphor sample synthesized
by the sol–gel method is more spherical in shape than that
of the samples synthesized by the other two methods at 1473 K.

A comparative study of the particle size distribution is
shown
as histograms from the SEM images of all three samples synthesized
by three different techniques in Figure 5. The average particle sizes are 1.90, 1.94,
and 1.53 μm in the cases of combustion, sol–gel, and
solid-state reaction methods, respectively, when the samples are heated at 1473
K. However, the average particle sizes of samples prepared by sol–gel
or by combustion methods at 973 K are much smaller.

2.2 Optical
Properties
2.2.1 Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Measurement
Figure 6 shows FTIR
spectra of the samples synthesized in different ways and heated to
different temperatures to study the vibrational behavior of the phosphor
samples. The vibrational behavior of the YVO4:Ho3+,Yb3+ phosphor synthesized the by solution combustion
method is shown in Figure 6a. The vibrational peaks are observed at 453 and 776 cm–1 due to Y–O and V–O vibrations.20 Some additional peaks such as at 1011 and 1062
cm–1 due to C–O and at 1370 cm–1 due to nitrate groups are observed. When the YVO4:Ho3+,Yb3+ phosphor is heated at 1473 K, the peaks
due to C–O and nitrate groups disappeared. The peak due to
V–O splits into two peaks, positioned at 760 and 830 cm–1, which may be due to increased crystallinity at higher
temperatures. Reduction in quenching centers as well as the absorbance
intensity due to the V–O group may be responsible for the enhancement
in the overall optical emission intensity. Figure 6b shows the FTIR spectra of the YVO4:Ho3+,Yb3+ phosphor synthesized by the sol–gel
technique. In this, all of the vibrational peaks show the same characteristics
as discussed earlier except that the peak due to V–O vibration
shifts toward the lower wave number side at 770 cm–1.

Figure 6 FTIR spectra of the YVO:Ho,Yb phosphor synthesized by the (a) combustion
method at 973 and 1473 K, (b) sol–gel method at 973 and 1473
K, and (c) all three methods (i.e., combustion, sol–gel, and
solid-state methods) at 1473 K.

A comparative study of vibrational behavior of YVO4:Ho3+,Yb3+ phosphors synthesized by combustion,
sol–gel,
and solid-state reaction methods and heated to 1473 K is shown in Figure 6c. The characteristic
spectra are nearly the same. The difference in all three spectra is
that the peak due to V–O vibration is lower for the phosphor
sample synthesized by the sol–gel method and the absorption
intensity of the band due to the V–O group is weaker than that
in the other two cases.

2.2.2 UV–Vis Absorption
Measurement
Figure 7 shows the
UV–vis–NIR absorption spectra of YVO4:Ho3+,Yb3+ phosphors synthesized by three different
methods in diffuse reflectance mode. The absorption spectrum of the
YVO:Ho,Yb phosphor synthesized by the combustion method at 973 K is
shown in Figure 7a.
There is a strong absorption band at 323 nm due to CTB of the (VO4)3– group, and no sharp peaks are seen due
to the f–f transition of the Ho3+ ion. When the
phosphor sample is heated at 1473 K, the sharp peaks are observed
at 456, 540, and 650 nm due to 5I8 → 5G6, 5I8 → 5F4/5S2, and 5I8 → 5F5 transitions of the Ho3+ ion. This suggests that on heating the transition probability increases,
which causes the enhancement in overall emission with temperature. Figure 7b shows the absorption
spectrum of the YVO:Ho,Yb phosphor synthesized by the sol–gel
technique. In this, the characteristics of the absorption spectra
show a similar type of nature as discussed above.

Figure 7 UV–vis absorption
spectra of the YVO4:Ho3+,Yb3+ phosphor
synthesized by the (a) combustion
method, (b) sol–gel method, and (c) all three methods at 1473
K.

Figure 7c shows
a comparative study of UV–vis–NIR absorption spectra
of the three YVO:Ho,Yb phosphor samples synthesized by three different
techniques at 1473 K. In all of the three spectra, the absorption
peaks of the YVO:Ho,Yb phosphor synthesized by the sol–gel
technique show strong absorption as compared to those for other two
methods. Thus, the intensity of the overall emission is more prominent
in YVO:Ho,Yb synthesized by the sol–gel method.

2.2.3 Photoluminescence Behavior
2.2.3.1 Upconversion
Emission
2.2.3.1.1 Combustion MethodFigure 8a shows the UC emission
spectra of the YVO4:Ho3+,Yb3+ phosphor
sample prepared
at 973 K on excitation with a 980 nm diode laser at 0.60 W pump power
synthesized by the solution combustion method. There is a weak green
emission at 540 nm due to 5F4/5S2 → 5I8 and intense red emission
at 659 nm due to the 5F5 → 5I8 transition of the Ho3+ ion. When the phosphor
sample is heated to 1473 K, the overall UC emission intensity enhances
significantly (see Figure 8b). The enhancement in green emission is nearly eight times
and in red emission is nearly nine times. Along with this, there are
weak emissions at 456 and 756 nm also due to 4G6 → 5I8 and 5F4/5S2 → 5I7 transitions
of the Ho3+ ion in the heated YVO4:Ho,Yb phosphor
sample. This increase in the UC emission intensity on heating the
sample may be due to the following reasons. The first reason is the
quenching centers like carbonates, nitrates, etc. that are removed
after heating the phosphor sample.21 The
second reason may be the modification in the shape and size of the
particles in the synthesized phosphor at 1473 K.22

Figure 8 (a) UC emission spectrum of YVO4:Ho3+,Yb3+ on excitation with a 980 nm laser at 0.6 W; (b) UC emission
spectrum of YVO4:Ho3+,Yb3+ on excitation
with a 980 nm laser at 0.6 W pump power and heating at 973 and 1473
K; (c) power dependence study of green and red emissions; and (d)
plot between the IR/IG ratio and pump power.

Figure 8c
shows
the power-dependent study of YVO4:Ho,Yb for two different
transitions at 540 and 659 nm. Since the UC process is a nonlinear
phenomenon related to Iuc α (Pin)n, where n is the number of
photons involved in a particular transition.23 In Figure 8c, the
log–log plot of the UC emission intensity and the pump power
gives the value of slope (n). Initially, the emission
intensity varies linearly with pump power. It rises suddenly, and
the value of slope (n) increases significantly after
certain threshold pump power. This behavior is known as the photon
avalanche UC process.24 At higher pump
power, saturation occurs and a decrease in slope suggests that there
is prominent heating in the material. Figure 8d shows the variation of the IR/IG ratio with the pump power
of diode laser. There are three regions in this: In the first region,
the ratio increases up to certain pump power (i.e., 500 mW), which
is due to low photon density. Thus, the lower levels are populated
more than the higher levels and the red emission intensity increases.
In the second region, the ratio decreases up to certain power (≈700
mW) of diode laser due to high photon density, which enhances the
population of higher levels, thereby increasing the green emission
intensity. The third region shows a rapid increase in the ratio with
pump power. It has been reported in the literature that heating becomes
more prominent at higher pump power and multiphonon relaxation increases.25,26 Due to this, the relaxation from the green-emitting level to a lower-lying
red-emitting level increases. Thus, the intensity of red emission
increases. This causes an increase in the ratio with pump power.

2.2.3.1.2 Sol–Gel MethodFigure 9a shows the UC emission spectrum
of the YVO4:Ho3+,Yb3+ phosphor sample
synthesized by the sol–gel method and heated at 973 K on excitation
with a 980 nm diode laser at 0.6 W pump power. The emission peaks
are at 540, 546, and 659 nm due to 5F4 → 5I8, 5S2 → 5I8, and 5F5 → 5I8 transitions of the Ho3+ ion, respectively.
The green emission at 540 nm in this case is more prominent than in
the phosphor sample prepared by the combustion method. The overall
emission intensity increases several times on heating the sample at
1473 K, as shown in Figure 9b. The enhancements in Green and Red emissions are nearly
63 and 56 times, respectively. The reason for the enhancement may
be the same as discussed in the earlier case. It has been already
observed in the SEM image that the particle size increases and shape
is also modified toward nearly spherical. Due to increase in size,
the separation between the activator and the sensitizer decreases,
which increases the possibility of the energy transfer between them.
Thus, the emission intensity is enhanced several times.

spectrum of the YVO4:Ho3+,Yb3+ phosphor
sample prepared by the sol–gel method
on excitation with a 980 nm laser at 0.6 W pump power; (b) UC emission
spectrum of YVO4:Ho3+,Yb3+ on excitation
with a 980 nm laser at 0.6 W and heating at 973 and 1473 K; (c) power
dependence study of green and red emissions; and (d) plot between
the IR/IG ratio
and pump power.

Figure 9c shows
the log–log plot between the UC emission intensity at two different
wavelengths and the power of the incident radiation. The slope gives
the number of photons involved in green and red emissions. The values
of “n” are 2.60 for green and 2.25
for red emissions. This suggests the contribution of the process involving
more than two photons for green emission and 2 photons for red emission.
This study is also helpful in explaining the mechanism for UC emission
by using an energy-level diagram, which will be discussed in the next
section. From the energy-level diagram, it seems that the involvement
of photons in green emission should be 2. However, in the present
case, it is more than 2, which may be due to the fast multiphonon
relaxation from the 5I6 level to the 5I7 level and also from 5F4 and 5S2 levels to the 5F5 level.
At higher pump powers, there is heating in the material, which is
termed as laser-induced optical heating. Therefore, multiphonon relaxation
becomes dominant and emission intensity decreases, which result in
a negative slope.

The variation of the IR/IG ratio with respect to the
pump power of the incident
radiation (i.e., 980 nm diode laser) is shown in Figure 9d. This variation gives very
important views about the UC emission mechanism with pump power. From
the figure, it can be seen that there are two regions. In the first
region, the IR/IG ratio decreases with an increase in the pump power up to
a certain limit (≈600 mW). Actually, with the increase of pump
power, the photon density increases, which increases the population
in the 5F4 and 5S2 levels,
and green emission intensity increases. After certain pump power (>600
mW), the heating in the material increases due to laser-induced optical
heating. Due to this, the multiphonon relaxation increases. Thus,
the Ho3+ ions in 5F4/5S2 levels relax rapidly to the 5F5 level. Due to this, the lower level 5F5 is
increasingly populated. This causes an increase in the emission intensity
of the red line at higher pump power. Thus, pump power can be used
to tune the emission from green to red.

2.2.3.1.3 Solid-State
Reaction Technique The upconversion
emission spectrum of the YVO4:Ho3+,Yb3+ phosphor sample prepared by the solid-state reaction method at 1473
K on excitation with a 980 nm diode laser at 0.6 W pump power is shown
in Figure 10a. The
characteristic spectrum is similar to that explained previously. In
this case, the green emission intensity is more prominent as compared
to that in the other two phosphor samples synthesized by other two
techniques. This increase in the green emission compared to others
is due to increase in size of particles and negligible quenching centers
at 1473 K. Figure 10b shows a comparative study of the UC emission spectra of all of
the three samples prepared by three different techniques and calcined
at 1473 K. This shows that the phosphor synthesized by the sol–gel
technique gives overall more intense emission as compared with the
other two techniques. Actually, in the samples synthesized by sol–gel
and combustion techniques at 973 K, the particles are in nano range size. After heat treatment to the prepared phosphor samples
at 1473 K, the particle size increases and the shape is also modified.
In the sample synthesized via the sol–gel method, the size
of the particle increases and the shape is also modified toward nearly
spherical. A comparison between all three phosphor samples synthesized
via three different techniques shows that the size of the particles
is larger and the particles are more spherical in the case of the
sol–gel technique than in the other two techniques. The modification
in shape and size of the surface particles supports the variation
in the UC emission intensity. The samples with nearly spherical shape
show more prominent UC emission intensity due to less scattering of
the incident radiation.22 Another reason
of the increment in UC emission intensity is the increment in particle
size at 1473 K. Silver et al.15 have reported
that the sample with larger particle size shows more emission intensity.

Figure 10 (a)
UC emission spectra of the YVO4:Ho3+,Yb3+ phosphor material prepared by the solid-state reaction method
on excitation with a 980 nm laser at 0.6 W pump power; (b) comparison
of UC emission spectra of the YVO4:Ho3+,Yb3+ phosphor prepared by different techniques at 1473 K; (c)
power dependence study of UC emission in the case of sample prepared
by the solid-state reaction method; (d) variation of the IR/IG ratio with power in the
case of sample prepared by the solid-state reaction method.

Figure 10c shows
the power-dependent emission intensity to calculate the number of
photons involved in the green (540 nm) and red (659 nm) UC emissions.
Its value is 2.40 for green and 2.18 for red emission. This suggests
the involvement of two photons for both emissions. The value of n decreases at a higher pump power, which suggests laser-induced
optical heating in the sample. The variation of the IR/IG ratio with pump power
is shown in Figure 10d. First, the ratio decreases up to 400 mW pump power and then increases
with pump power. This means that at lower pump power green emission
intensity increases with the pump power up to 400 mW, then, it saturates, and finally
decreases at higher power. At higher pump power, the ions are excited
to 5F4/5S2 and then relax
to populate the 5F5 level to give red emission.
The reason behind this behavior is explained earlier.

From power
dependence study of all of the three phosphor samples
synthesized by different techniques, it is observed that the phosphor
synthesized by the combustion technique shows a tendency toward the
photon avalanche process after certain threshold pump power and laser-induced
optical heating is observed at high power. However, in the case of
the other two phosphors synthesized by sol–gel and solid-state
methods, there is no photon avalanche process; however, heating is
observed at comparatively low pump power. Another interesting observation
is that relaxation at higher power is more prominent in the case of
the green-emitting level than for the red-emitting level.

2.2.3.1.4 Mechanism Involved in Upconversion EmissionFigure 11 shows
the energy-level diagram to explain the mechanism involved in the
UC emission on excitation with a 980 nm diode laser. In the present
system, the Yb3+ ion acts as a sensitizer and the Ho3+ ion is an activator. When the Ho3+/Yb3+-codoped YVO4 phosphor is irradiated by a 980 nm diode
laser, the Yb3+ ion absorbs the incident radiation strongly
due to its higher absorption cross section for 980 nm wavelength than
that of the Ho3+ ion. The deexcitation energy of the Yb3+ ion is transferred to the Ho3+ ion. However,
due to mismatch in the energy levels of the two ions, the energy transfer
will be phonon-assisted one. The Ho3+ ion in the ground
state (5I8) is promoted to 5I6 via phonon-assisted energy transfer. The Ho3+ ion
in the 5I6 level absorbs second photon and promoted
to the 5F4/5S2 level via
the ESA/ETU process. Thus, various transitions observed in green and
red regions are represented as      There may be several other channels also for
the UC emission from various other excited levels. There are various
quenching centers also present in the system. Thus, the strong nonradiative
relaxation takes place from 5I6 to 5I7. The ions in the 5I7 level absorb
the second incident photon and promoted to the 5F5 level via the ETU/ESA process. After absorbing the third photon,
the Ho3+ ions are promoted to the 5G4 level. The relaxation from this high-lying level to 5F4/5S2 and 5F5 levels gives emission in green and red regions. The mechanism can
be represented as        The samples prepared by sol–gel and
combustion methods follow this mechanism to build up population in
higher levels. Therefore, the green emission is very weak as compared
to the red emission in the YVO:Ho3+,Yb3+ phosphor
synthesized by these two different techniques.

Figure 11 Possible energy-level
diagram to explain the upconversion emission
behavior of the YVO4:Ho3+,Yb3+ phosphor.

Another channel for the UC emission
is cooperative energy transfer
between two Yb3+ ions and one Ho3+ ion. In this
process, two excited Yb3+ ions interact simultaneously
with one Ho3+ in the ground state and transfer their energies
to Ho3+ to promote it to the 5F2 level.
The relaxation from this level to lower levels gives various transitions
in different regions.  A nonradiative
relaxation from these levels
to 5F4/5S2 gives green
emission. However, this channel is not as effective as the other two
channels.

2.2.3.2 Downshifting Emission
Figure 12 shows
the downshifting
behavior of Ho3+-doped YVO4 phosphor samples
synthesized by two different methods (i.e., solution combustion and
sol–gel methods). Figure 12a shows the photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra
of the YVO4:Ho3+,Yb3+ phosphor synthesized
by the combustion method with λEmi = 539 nm. There
is a broad peak at 312 nm due to the charge transfer band of the (VO4)3– group and a weak sharp peak at 456 nm
due to the 5I8 → 5G6 transition of the Ho3+ ion. On excitation with a 312
nm laser, there is a broad photoluminescence peak at 450 nm due to
the (VO4)3– group, which suggests that
this host is a self-activated host. In addition to a broad peak, there
appears a large number of sharp peaks at 539, 663, and 756 nm due
to 5F4/5S2 → 5I8, 5F5 → 5I8, and 5F4 → 5I7 transitions of the Ho3+ ion. It is interesting
to note that whereas in the UC process the sample gives intense red
emission, in DS, it gives intense green and weak red emissions. This
is due to the change in the channel of the excitation of Ho3+ ions.

monitoring emission at 539 nm, (b) PL emission spectra of the YVO4:Ho3+,Yb3+ phosphor synthesized by the
combustion method at 973 and 1473 K on excitation with a 312 nm laser,
(c) PLE spectrum of the YVO4:Ho3+,Yb3+ phosphor synthesized by the sol–gel method at 973 K by monitoring
emission at 539 nm, and (d) PL emission spectra of the YVO4:Ho3+,Yb3+ phosphor synthesized by the sol–gel
method at 973 and 1473 K on excitation with a 318 nm laser.

When the phosphor sample is heated
at 1473 K, the overall emission
of the host as well as the Ho3+ ion enhances significantly
(see Figure 12b).
This enhancement may be due to reduction in quenching centers at high
temperature and due to modification in the shape and size of the particles.
This has been justified by the enhancement in transition probability
as observed in UV–vis absorption spectra and also by FTIR spectra.
The mechanism behind the DS behavior is well explained by the energy-level
diagram. Figure 12c,d shows the photoluminescence excitation and emission spectra of
the YVO4:Ho3+,Yb3+ phosphor synthesized
by the sol–gel method. In this case also, the phosphor sample
shows the same characteristic spectrum and behavior as explained in
the phosphor synthesized by the combustion method.

In Figure 13, a
comparative study of DS behaviors of YVO4:Ho3+,Yb3+ phosphor samples synthesized by three different
methods such as combustion, sol–gel, and solid-state reaction
methods are reported at 1473 K. Figure 13a shows the PLE spectra of YVO4:Ho3+,Yb3+ by monitoring the emission at 539
nm due to the 5F4/5S2 → 5I8 transition of the Ho3+ ion synthesized
by three different techniques. The CTB due to the (VO4)3– group is observed in the UV region in all of the
three cases. The peak value of CTB shifts toward the higher wavelength
side (i.e., 312, 318, and 327 nm) in the case of samples synthesized
by combustion, sol–gel, and solid-state methods, respectively.
This shift may be due to change in the environment after the synthesis
of the sample. The CTB is more intense in the phosphor synthesized
by the solid-state reaction method. It can also be observed in Figure 13b that the emission
from the (VO4)3– group is more prominent
for the same sample. Therefore, overall emission is more intense for
the same sample due to energy transfer from the (VO4)3– group to the Ho3+ ion on excitation with
a 327 nm diode laser. Figure 13c shows the comparative emission spectra of phosphor samples
synthesized by three different methods on excitation with a 456 nm
diode laser. In this case, the sample synthesized by the sol–gel
method at 1473 K gives more intense DS behavior. This may be due to
increase of particle size in the sample prepared by the sol–gel
method, as explained earlier, and also the absence of quenching centers.1

Figure 13 (a) PLE spectra of the YVO4:Ho3+,Yb3+ phosphor synthesized by three different methods
at 1473 K by monitoring
emission at 539 nm; PL emission spectra of YVO4:Ho3+,Yb3+ phosphor synthesized by three different
methods at 1473 K on excitation with (b) 327 nm and (c) 456 nm laser.

The mechanism behind this DS behavior
is well explained by a possible
energy-level diagram, as shown in the Figure 14. The (VO4)3– group is excited on excitation with a 327 nm laser. The emission
from the (VO4)3– group is observed in
the broad blue region at 450 nm. There is resonant energy transfer
from the (VO4)3– group to the 5G4 level of the Ho3+ ion. The Ho3+ ions relax from that level to lower-lying levels and give various
emissions in different wavelengths. When the phosphor sample is excited
with a 456 nm laser, the Ho3+ ion is promoted to the 5G6 level directly. The relaxation from this level
to low-lying levels gives various emissions in different regions.

DS behavior.

3 Conclusions
Ho3+/Yb3+-codoped YVO4 phosphors
have been synthesized using three different techniques. SEM images
show the modification in shape and size of the surface particles synthesized
by different techniques and also by heating all of the samples at
1473 K. The intensity of the vibrational peaks reduces on annealing
the samples at 1473 K synthesized by sol–gel/combustion methods.
The UV–vis–NIR absorption spectra show only few and
weak bands in the samples synthesized by sol–gel/combustion
methods. However, these absorption bands are strong in the annealed
samples. The UV–vis–NIR bands are maximum for the phosphor
synthesized by the sol–gel method. The UC emission in Ho3+/Yb3+-codoped YVO4 phosphors synthesized
by combustion and sol–gel techniques at 973 K shows intense
red and weak green emissions. The UC emission intensity increases
significantly about 65 times in green and 56 times in red emission
on heating the phosphor at 1473 K in the phosphor sample synthesized
by the sol–gel method. This enhancement in the overall UC emission
is also due to increase in particle size and also modification in
the shape of particles toward nearly spherical. The intense red emission
in such a material can be used for the bioimaging application. The
same samples in the DS process emit intense green and weak red bands.
The enhancement is also observed in DS behavior of the material at
higher temperature. Thus, the phosphor sample synthesized by the sol–gel
technique gives better optical properties.

4 Experimental
Methods
4.1 Chemicals Used
Analytical-grade yttrium
oxide (Y2O3, 99.9%, Alfa-Aesar), vanadium pentoxide
(V2O5, 99.9%, Himedia), holmium oxide (Ho2O3, 99.99%, Alfa-Aesar), and ytterbium oxide (Yb2O3, 99.99%, Alfa-Aesar) were used for the synthesis
of Y0.94Ho0.01Yb0.05VO4 (YVO:Ho,Yb) phosphor samples using three different techniques.

4.2 Synthesis of Phosphors
The phosphor
samples were synthesized using three different techniques:

4.2.1 Solution Combustion Method
All
of the oxide samples in their stoichiometric proportions were dissolved
in nitric acid to form their nitrates. The nitrates thus formed were
mixed with each other properly and then with urea. The mixture was
then kept on a magnetic stirrer at 353 K and stirred till it was converted
into a gel. The gel was then transferred to a crucible and placed
in an electric furnace where the combustion was carried out at 973
K. During combustion, different gases were released and the gel was
converted into a foamlike material. The material was then grinded
in an agate mortar, which gave us the final compound for further measurements.
A part of this sample was heated to 1473 K for 4 h. Thus, there are
two samples prepared by this method on (I) heating at 973 K and (II)
heating at 1473 K.

4.2.2 Sol–Gel Method
In this method,17 all of the chemicals
in the oxide form in stoichiometric
proportion were converted into the nitrate form as in the earlier
case. The nitrate forms of these chemicals were mixed together properly.
The citric acid in 2:1 ratio and polyethylene glycol (molecular weight
8000) were added to this mixture. The resultant mixture was stirred
for 1 h for homogeneous mixing, and then, the whole mixture was heated
at 348 K in a water bath for the formation of a homogeneous gel. The
gel was kept in the oven at 383 K for 12 h to form a powder sample.
Then, the powder sample was fired at 973 and 1473 K for 4 h.

4.2.3 Solid-State Reaction Method
In
this technique,18 the stoichiometric amounts
of pure starting oxide materials were thoroughly mixed in an agate
mortar for nearly 1 h to form a homogeneous mixture using nearly 50
ml of acetone as a mixing medium. The homogeneous mixture was placed
in an alumina crucible, heated in an electric furnace at 1473 K temperature
for 4 h, and then cooled to room temperature. The phosphor sample
thus obtained was crushed to get fine powder of the phosphor for further
studies.

Thus, there are five samples for further studies.

4.3 Characterizations
The X-ray diffraction
patterns of all of the five powder phosphor samples were monitored
using an 18 kW Cu rotating anode-based high-resolution Rigaku X-powder
(XRD) diffractometer. The surface morphology of the samples was monitored
using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) unit [ZEISS (SEM-Supra40
model)] operated at 20 kV. The vibrational structure of the synthesized
phosphor samples was studied using a PerkinElmer FTIR spectrometer
(Frontier) in the range 400–1500 cm–1. UV–vis–NIR
absorption measurements were carried out using a PerkinElmer UV/vis/NIR
spectrometer [model Lambda 750] in the range 300–1100 nm. For
DS measurements, a Fluorolog-3 model FL 3-11 (Horiba Jobin Yvon) spectrophotometer
equipped with a 450 W xenon flash lamp was used. The UC luminescence
spectra were obtained using a 980 nm tunable CW diode laser (2W, Model-III980,
Chengchun New Industries optoelectronics tech. Co. Ltd.,) as an excitation
source, and the emission was monitored using an iHR 320 (Horiba Jobin
Yvon) spectrometer equipped with an R928P photomultiplier tube (PMT).
All of the measurements of the samples have been carried out in the
powder form at room temperature.
