The development of
three-dimensional (3D) porous graphitic structures
is of great interest for electrochemical sensing applications as they
can support fast charge transfer and mass transport through their
extended, large surface area networks. In this work, we present the
facile fabrication of conductive and porous graphitic electrodes by
direct laser writing techniques. Irradiation of commercial polyimide
sheets (Kapton tape) was performed using a low-cost laser engraving
machine with visible excitation wavelength (405 nm) at low power (500
mW), leading to formation of 3D laser-induced graphene (LIG) structures.
Systematic correlation between applied laser dwell time per pixel
(“dwell time”) and morphological/structural properties
of fabricated electrodes showed that conductive and highly 3D porous
structures with spectral signatures of nanocrystalline graphitic carbon
materials were obtained at laser dwell times between 20 and 110 ms/pix,
with graphenelike carbon produced at 50 ms/pix dwell time, with comparable
properties to LIG obtained with high cost CO2 lasers. Electrochemical
characterization with inner and outer sphere mediators showed fast
electron transfer rates, comparable to previously reported 2D/3D graphene-based
materials and other graphitic carbon electrodes. This work opens the
way to the facile fabrication of low-cost, disposable electrochemical
sensor platforms for decentralized assays.

Introduction
Graphitic and graphenelike
materials are intensively studied because
of their unique physical and chemical properties which can be exploited
for fabrication of electrochemical sensors and biosensors.1−3 The interest toward these materials for sensing applications arises
from the possibility of tuning their analytical performance by controlling
structure, morphology, porosity, and surface functionalities of the
carbon electrodes, as all the above chemico-physical parameters have
a direct impact on the electron transfer (ET) rate. For example, it
is known that graphite basal and edge planes possess different surface
morphologies and that ET kinetics are greatly enhanced at graphene
edge sites because of high density of defects and corrugations.1 Moreover, it has been reported that the use of
porous graphene three dimensional (3D) structures can lead to enhanced
electrochemical responses, associated with availability of highly
conducting pathways, providing high mass transport and charge transfer
rates.4,5 Therefore, the realization of high-performance
electrochemical sensors requires the availability of large mass two-dimensional
(2D) graphitic materials extending into large porous 3D networks.
This process is usually achieved by application of costly (chemical
vapor deposition, CVD),6 cumbersome (spray
coating),7 or inefficient (self-assembly
of reduced graphene oxide) techniques.8 Another issue is that the complex solution processing of graphenelike
materials leads to aggregated graphene sheets with dramatically reduced
surface area and, therefore, reduced electrochemical activity.9 Therefore, the development of straightforward
fabrication methods enabling high-throughput, low-cost, and large-scale
fabrication of 3D graphene-based electrodes under ambient conditions
is a technologically important goal for the realization of highly
sensitive electrochemical sensors. Recently, porous graphitic structures
have been obtained by direct laser writing methods on commercial polyimide
sheets (Kapton tape). For example, extended 3D graphitic structures
(laser-induced graphene, LIG) were patterned on polyimide by simple
direct writing with CO2 laser irradiation under ambient
conditions.10−13 The formation of LIG was ascribed to the generation of local high
temperatures induced by a resonance effect between the laser wavelength
and the polyimide, which caused carbonization and subsequent graphitization
of polyimide. During this process, the polyimide sp3-carbon
atoms were photoconverted in sp2-carbon atoms by pulsed
laser irradiation. Atoms from broken C–H, C–O, C=O,
and C–N bonds were released as gas, thus contributing to porous
structure formation. In addition, as the process occurred under ambient
conditions, the fast release of locally available, hydrogen, oxygen,
and water in the form of H2, CO, and CO2 gases
resulted in formation of highly porous structures.10 The main application of LIG materials so far has been in
the field of energy storage, whereby LIG structures were successfully
used as electrodes for fabrication of low cost and flexible supercapacitors.10−12 However, recent reports of LIG electrodes for demonstration of on-chip
electrochemical sensing have also emerged.14,15 For example, Nakak et al. found that the morphology of LIG, rich
in defect and edge plane sites and functional enough to be wetted
by aqueous electrolytes, was particularly amenable to electrochemical
sensing applications and reported high electro-catalytic activity
and high sensitivity toward ascorbic acid, dopamine, and uric acid.14 The same authors also demonstrated sensitive
(5 pM in serum) biodetection by aptamer biofunctionalization of LIG.16 Also, Cardoso et al. showed fabrication of molecularly
imprinted chloramphenicol sensors on LIG electrodes.17 The variety of applications and the simplicity of instrumentation
(laser engraving machine operating under ambient conditions) and precursor
materials (commercial Kapton tape) required to make such electrodes
suggest that LIG could be used for the large-scale fabrication of
disposable electrochemical sensors for decentralized assays (point-of-care,
in situ monitoring). Toward this end, LIG structures were recently
obtained by the use of visible laser sources and demonstration of
biogenic amines in food samples achieved.18−20 This is a desirable
development toward further reduction of production costs. However,
the use of 405 nm lasers required pre-electrode or postelectrode doping
in order to show satisfactory applications.

In this paper, we
present the fabrication of porous, conductive,
and 3D graphitic electrodes obtained by direct writing of polyimide
sheets under ambient conditions with a low-cost laser engraving tool
equipped with a 405 nm irradiation wavelength laser diode. As the
irradiation power of this laser source was fixed at 500 mW, a detailed
investigation of the correlation between applied dwell times and the
resulting morphological, structural, electrical, and electrochemical
characteristics of obtained LIG electrodes was performed. It was found
that dwell times in the range 40–60 ms/pix led to formation
of conductive, porous structures with nanocrystalline graphitic carbon
spectral signatures, evidenced by Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) data. The electrochemical properties of LIG electrodes were
tested with innersphere and outersphere redox mediators and showed
fast ET kinetics and heterogeneous electron transfer (HET) rates comparable
to other graphene-based materials and edge plane pyrolytic graphite
(EPPG).

Results and Discussion
All electrodes in this work
were fabricated by direct laser writing
of polyimide tape attached onto a glass microscope slide or coverslip
for mechanical support. Figure 1a shows a schematic of the LIG process, whereby computer-aided
designs were written on polyimide tape by laser raster scanning with
a commercial laser engraving machine. Figure 1b–d shows photographs of representative
one-, two-, and three-electrode electrochemical sensor platforms fabricated
at 50 ms/pix dwell time, comprising a thin line (ca. 120 μm
width) as the working electrode and thicker lines (ca. 1 mm) as counter
and reference electrodes.

Figure 2 shows correlated
optical (a–d) and scanning electron (e–h) microscopy
images of LIG electrodes obtained at representative 20, 50, 80, and
110 ms/pix laser dwell times. It should be specified that the dwell
time is the time the focused laser beam rested on a single pixel and
illuminated it. Therefore, longer pixel times correspond to lower
laser scan speeds. Complete sequences of optical and electron microscopy
images for the full range of dwell times (10–110 ms/pix) are
shown (Figures S1 and S2, respectively).
The optical images showed that the LIG track patterns comprised individual
quasi-hemispherical islands (see blue square Figure 2c), where each island corresponded to one
pixel in the original design. At low dwell times, the LIG pixel islands
had a diameter of ca. 100 μm with clear “necks”
between adjacent islands. However, as the dwell time increased, the
island diameters increased to ∼130 μm, and the interisland
separation decreased until coalescence of adjacent pixel islands was
observed above 40 ms/pix dwell time. Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images showed that the LIG islands were characterized by a highly
porous 3D morphology associated with the rapid generation of gas (breaking
of C–H, C–N, C–O, C=O atoms, and local
oxygen) occurring during the LIG process and increased by the availability
of local O2 because of the process being performed under
ambient conditions.10,21 As already observed in the optical
images, SEM images showed that individual islands became increasingly
better-defined and showed increased coalescence as the dwell time
increased. Specifically, at 20 ms/pix dwell time, a 3D surface topography
characterized by micron-scale blister-like features was observed.
Very few micropores were observed at this dwell time. In contrast,
as the laser dwell time increased, open micropores were clearly evident
across the surface, consistent with “bursting” of the
microblisters due to explosion of gas microbubbles and/or ablation
of surface material. This morphology was consistent with the occurring
of a laser-assisted high-temperature and high pressure process, whereby
polyimide absorbed the laser photon energy and converted it into heat.22 In order to quantify the sample porosity, gas
adsorption measurements (Figure S3) were
performed for 50 ms/pix LIG and revealed formation of a microporous
structure with a specific surface area of 428 m2/g, higher
than the 342 m2/g value, reported by Lin et al., for LIG
structures obtained by CO2 laser irradiation.10

Scale bars on optical images: 50 μm.

Electron microscopy was also used to measure the thickness of fabricated
LIGs. The nominal thickness of commercial polyimide tape was 80 μm. Figure 3a shows a cross-section
SEM image of a single line written at dwell time 50 ms/pix and showing
a LIG structure ∼50 μm protruding ∼50 μm
above the polyimide substrate. The nearly Gaussian LIG shape reflected
the laser intensity beam distribution, a feature that has not been
reported with higher cost/high power laser engraving systems.23 Thickness data for LIG lines written in the
20–120 ms/pix dwell time range were obtained by profilometry. Figure 3b shows average heights
measured for three different sets of lines across three areas. The
protrusion thickness increased from 43 to 51 μm as dwell times
increased from 20 to 50 ms/pix and slowly decreased to 34 μm
for higher dwell times, suggesting the occurrence of oxidation or
ablation processes, deleterious for the formation of good quality
graphitic carbon structures.10

ms/pix dwell time range.

LIG surface properties
investigated by contact angle (CA) measurements
showed hydrophobic characteristics. Specifically, measurements were
performed for LIG structures obtained in the 20–110 ms/pix
dwell times (see Figure S4), and the following
CA values were found: LIG 20 ms/pix = 85°; LIG 50 ms/pix = 94°;
LIG 80 ms/pix = 146°; and LIG 110 ms/pix = 128°. These data
were in contrast with LIG hydrophobic properties reported for structures
made by CO2 laser scribing.14,24 However, our
data were in agreement with surface properties of other LIG structures
fabricated by 405 nm lasers18,19 The CAs of low dwell
time structures were consistent with CA values reported for amorphous
carbon (a-C) structures deposited under either high temperature (200
°C, CA = 97°)25 or high temperature/pressure
(85 °C and 10 mbar, CA = 85°) conditions.26 The hydrophobicity of a-C materials was attributed to the
presence of nanosized to microsized particles randomly distributed
on the carbon surface. Similarly, a microporous surface was observed
in LIG structures obtained at 20 and 50 ms/pix dwell times. Reported
values were also in agreement with wettability studies performed on
graphitic carbon, reporting apparent water-contact angles between
35 and 126° for either basal or edge graphite surfaces, depending
on surface contamination and roughness.27 The increased hydrophobicity measured for the 80 ms/pix LIG structure
could be ascribed to an increased surface roughness and by the presence
of oxygen and other reactive molecules free to attach to dangling
bonds during LIG formation. In addition, as LIG formation occurs under
ambient conditions, air molecules can easily get trapped within the
microporous structures, preventing liquid molecules to enter into
the pores and, therefore, giving hydrophobicity. A slight decrease
in hydrophobicity (from 146 to 128°) was measured for LIG structures
obtained at 110 ms/pix and was associated with the occurrence of oxidation
and ablation processes, resulting in an increased percentage of sp3 bonds (see further Raman and XPS characterization).25,26

Figure 4 shows
electrical
characterization data acquired from a total of 57 transmission line
structures fabricated over a range of dwell times (10–120 ms/pix). Figure 4a shows a typical
set of two-terminal current versus voltage (I–V) curves for positive bias voltages (0–1 V), measured
for a single transmission line device fabricated at 50 ms/pix. All
curves are linear over the bias voltage range (±1 V). Figure 4b shows the track
resistance data for this structure plotted versus track length. Linear
regression of these data allows the sheet resistance and the contact
resistance to be calculated from the slope and intercept, respectively
(see eq 1, Experimental Session). For this device, sheet resistance Rs = 85 ± 8 Ω/square and contact resistance Rc = 575 ± 65 Ω were measured. Panels
c and d in Figure 4 show the extracted Rs and Rc data for multiple devices for each dwell time (30 devices
in total). The trend shows a region of lower sheet resistance (80–100
Ω/square) for dwell times in the range 40–70 ms/pix.
The contact resistance data (Figure 4d) also show minimum values (∼600 Ω) over
the same dwell time range. These data correlated well with the small
and not uniform pore distribution and poor degree of structural connection
between pixels observed in the optical images of Figure 2 for low dwell times. However,
for dwell times of 40 ms/pix and above sheet resistance values abruptly
dropped and saturated at ∼80 Ω/square. This behavior
was consistent with the formation of structures constituted by well-connected
spherical units, as shown by optical and electron microscopy images
(Figure 2). In addition,
measured sheet resistance values correlated well with the observed
thickness values previously measured, showing that up to 60 ms/pix,
LIG structures of increased thickness showed decreased sheet resistance
values and that increased resistance was measured at high dwell times,
in agreement with the occurrence of deterioration processes at such
high dwell times. The measured sheet resistance values at this modest
laser power (0.5 W) were lower than values reported for other graphene-derived
samples (graphene/PET 280 Ω/sq;28 graphene/SiO2 350 Ω/square;29 rGO/PET 226 Ω/square)30 and LIG/polyimide structures, reported by Romero et al., for a 405
nm laser diode at 0.1 W power (242, 295 Ω/square).21 As expected, sheet resistance values were larger
than the 35 Ω/square value, reported by Tour et al., for LIG
from CO2 laser irradiation at higher laser powers (3.5
W).10 In addition, our sheet resistance
values were significantly lower in comparison with values reported
for 3D nanostructured graphene structures obtained by inkjet printing/laser
irradiation processes (10 MΩ/sq before laser irradiation, 0.7
kΩ/sq post laser irradiation).31

time measured for dwell times 10–120 ms/pix.

Figure 5a
shows
representative LIG Raman spectra for four distinct dwell times: 20,
50, 80, and 110 ms/pix. Each spectrum shows two strong and distinct
peaks in the 1000–1800 cm–1 range: the G
mode centered close to 1580 cm–1, assigned to in-plane
bond stretching of pairs of sp2 carbon atoms and the D
mode centered close to 1350 cm–1, assigned to a
defect-activated radial breathing mode.32,33 Most of the
spectra showed weak and/or broad features in the 2D region close to
2700 cm–1. However, spectra with clear second-order
2D peaks could be observed for low dwell times (20–60 ms/pix),
indicating generation of graphenelike carbon morphologies. As SEM
images of Figure 2 showed
formation of structures with inhomogeneous morphologies, a deeper
Raman analysis was carried out, whereby for each dwell time, 24 spectra
were acquired across an 8 × 3 grid with a pitch of 15 μm
close to the central axis of the track, that is, over a rectangular
area of length 120 μm (parallel to track) and width 45 μm.
Single Lorentzian line shapes were fitted to the D, G, and 2D regions.
Considering the first-order D and G peaks, Figure 5b,c, respectively, showed that dwell times
in the 20–50 ms/pix range yielded to the lowest mean full width
at half maximum (fwhm) values of 85–100 and 75–80 cm–1 for D and G peaks, respectively. For higher dwell
times, a broadening of these peaks was observed, representative of
an increased degree of disorder in the sample.

Error bars in (b,c) represent the standard error on the mean plus

These observations fitted well
with the trends reported by Koenig
and Koenig in the first Raman study of graphite.34 On the basis of the studies of microcrystalline samples,
the authors proposed an empirical model, whereby the ratio of the
intensities for the D and G peaks (ID/IG) scaled inversely with the crystallite size, La (determined from X-ray data). In this work
and subsequent reports from many groups, there is an evident trend
of increased ID/IG and broadening of both D and G peaks as the disorder in the
sample increased, for example, through ion implantation of natural
graphite.35 These authors more recently
developed a model for disordered graphite with calculated disorder-induced
peaks close to 1360 cm–1 (D peak) and 1620 cm–1 (now termed the D′ peak) and the expected
G peak.33 Robertson and Ferrari developed
a framework to interpret this “amorphization trajectory”
from pure graphite to nanocrystalline graphite to amorphous carbon
in terms of the factors that control the position, intensity, and
widths of the G and D peaks.32 For LIG
structures, data extracted from Lorentzian peak fits (Figures 5b,c and S5) are consistent with stage 1 of the trajectory, that is,
between highly ordered graphite and nanocrystalline graphitic domains
in a disordered carbon matrix. Specifically, the G peak position (Pos(G))
remaining close to 1580 cm–1 (Figure S5b) and ID/IG < 1 (Figure 5d) across the entire dwell time range suggest that the laser-induced
graphitization process results in nanocrystalline graphitic carbon
films, with the highest order in the 20–50 ms/pix dwell time
range. Furthermore, comparing the spectra acquired for 50 ms/pix dwell
time with the data reported by Lespade et al. suggests grain sizes
in the range 3–7 nm.35 The presence
of sharp 2D peaks provides further evidence for a higher degree of
ordering. Out of more than 250 spectra acquired across all dwell times,
23 spectra showed evidence of a distinct 2D peak fwhm (2D) < 200
cm–1 and I2D/IG > 0.2, (Figure S5e). The majority of these spectra (21 of 23) were acquired in the
20–50 ms/pix dwell time range (Figure 5c). Taken together, the Raman and I–V data suggest an optimum dwell
time window close to 50 ms/pix. Data for low dwell times (10–20
ms/pix) are consistent with a lower degree of order because of incomplete
graphitization, while the data from the higher dwell times (80–110
ms/pix) are consistent with disorder arising from unwanted oxidation
or ablation.

The laser-treated films were further characterized
by XPS. Figure 6 shows
XPS surveys
of LIGs obtained at 20, 50, 80, and 110 ms/pix, showing how the surface
was mainly constituted by carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen. The deconvolution
of the main C1s peak in its components (the main peak C–C
sp2 and C–C sp3 carbon bonds, C–O(H)
epoxides and hydroxides, carbonyls C=O, and carboxyls O–C=O(H)
and the π–π* transition loss) showed low contribution
from polyimide O–C=O and C=O bonds, whereas the
contribution from sp2-C–C bonds was the highest
in the 20–80 ms/pix dwell time interval. In contrast, at 110
ms/pix, the majority of carbon was sp3-type, supporting
the previous hypothesis that deterioration of the surface or ablation
occurred at this high dwell time. The N1s peak (shown in Figure S7) consists of one component at samples
20, 50, and 80 ms/pix centered at 400.1 eV, whereas in the 110 ms/pix
irradiated sample, a second component appeared at ∼402 eV,
commonly assigned to oxidized nitrogen atoms. The atomic content of
the constituent atoms is presented in Table 1. From the core level peaks of C 1s, O 1s,
and N 1s, the percentage atomic concentration of carbon, oxygen, and
nitrogen was determined by dividing the peak intensities with the
appropriate relative sensitivity factor after correcting them from
the experimentally determined EA10 analyzer transmission characteristics.
High percentages of carbon sp2-type and low percentages
of oxygen and nitrogen in the 20–80 ms/pix dwell time interval
confirmed the rapid breaking and removal of C–N, C–O,
and C=O and sp2 carbon atoms occurring during the
LIG process responsible for the formation of the porous morphology.
Also, the C–O peak becomes more prominent than the C=O
in the 20–50 ms/pix dwell time interval (Figure S6). In contrast, at 110 ms/pix, lower percentage of
carbon sp2-type, increased presence of carbon sp3-type, and atomic oxygen atomic concentration occurs. Moreover, the
presence of the nitrogen oxide component in the N 1s peak was detected
under this burning condition.

Finally, the electrochemical behavior of LIG electrodes was investigated
by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements performed with two redox systems:
outer-sphere Ru(NH3)63+/2+ and inner
sphere Fe(CN)63–/4–. In order
to accurately monitor the electrochemical behavior of the LIG working
electrode and to accurately compare HET values with literature data,
CVs were recorded in a three electrode system with a Pt wire as the
counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. CVs were
also recorded in [Ru(NH3)6]3+/2+ for
systems including LIG as counter and working electrodes (see Figure S9) to show versatility and easiness of
use of the fabricated systems. Quasi-reversible behavior between 5
and 500 mV/s scan rates and monotonic increase of the oxidation peak
current with the square root of the scan rate was observed for both
systems (Figure S9).

The electrochemical
characteristics of LIG working electrodes fabricated
between 20 and 110 ms/pix are illustrated in Figure 7a. The electrodes showed decreasing values
of differential peak potential (ΔEp) until a minimum value of 74.5 and 85.6 mV was reached at 50 ms/pix
for [Ru(NH3)6]3+/2+ and [Fe(CN)6]3–/4–, respectively. The ΔEp value obtained for [Ru(NH3)6]3+/2+ was lower than the average 85.6 mV value,
reported by Nayak et al., for LIG structures obtained by CO2 laser fabrication and was comparable with the average 74.5 mV value
reported by the same authors for hybrid LIG/Pt electrodes.14 In contrast, the value obtained for [Fe(CN)6]3–/4– was comparable with the average
value of 85.6 mV, reported by Nayak et al., for LIG electrodes. Figure 7b shows CVs of an
LIG working electrode fabricated at 50 ms/pix recorded between 5 and
200 mV/s for [Ru(NH3)6]3+/2+, showing
quasi-reversible reaction versus Ag/AgCl reference electrode, evidenced
by the monotonic increase/decrease of the oxidation/reduction peak
current with square root of the scan rate (inset of Figure 7b). Equivalent CVs for all
dwell times in the interval 30–120 ms/pix are showed in Figure S11. The average HET (k0) value calculated by the Nicholson method36 over three 50 ms/pix electrodes was 0.0146 ±
2.08 cm/s, comparable to other sp2 carbon materials, such
as graphene on a copper electrode ((15 ± 2) × 10–3 cm/s)37 and Q-graphene (18 × 10–3 cm/s).38 Favorable ET
kinetic was found compared to other graphene materials such as monolayer
graphene (1.1 × 10–3 cm/s) and quasi-graphene
(1.6 × 10–3 cm/s) and graphite-based electrodes
(edge plane pyrolytic graphite EPPG = 8.8 × 10–3 cm/s and basal plane pyrolytic graphite BPPG = 38 × 10–3 cm/s).39 This is interesting
because [Ru(NH3)6]3+/2+ being an
outer sphere redox mediator is insensitive to the oxygen content and
the surface structure, and only sensitive to the density of electronic
states (DOS). This means that the reversible redox reaction of [Ru(NH3)6]3+/2+ (i.e., rapid ET) on the LIG
electrode must be supported by a sufficient DOS. This in turn can
only be due to the increased DOS at the edges of graphene (compared
to basal planes), resulting in a faster electrode kinetics and associated
with the high 3D porous network rich in edge sites. The average HET
(k0) value calculated for [Fe(CN)6]3–/4– by the Nicholson method over
three electrodes was (13 ± 1) × 10–3 cm/s
(data not shown), comparable with reported literature data of CVD-Gr
and Q-graphene.14

at 0.386 mV and a reduction peak at 0.352 mV (vs Ag/AgCl). Peak position
and sensitivity were comparable to those obtained in literature for
carbon screen printed macroscopic electrodes.40 Finally, square-wave voltammetry was performed to characterize the
electrochemical behavior of LIG electrodes with benzocaine (inset Figure 7d). A scan from 0
to 0.6 V versus Ag/AgCl was applied at a frequency of 100 Hz, with
an amplitude of 100 mV and a step potential of 1 mV. All benzocaine
measurements were performed using a portable potentiostat apparatus,
in order to further show practical use and applicability.

Conclusions
LIG electrodes were fabricated on flexible polyimide sheets by
direct laser irradiation with low cost visible laser engraving machines
under ambient conditions. The morphological, structural, electrical,
and electrochemical characteristics of LIGs obtained at different
laser dwell times between 20 and 120 ms/pix were investigated. It
was found that structures obtained at 40–50 ms/pix dwell times
displayed 3D porous morphology, low sheet resistance, and graphenelike
carbon spectral signatures. The electrochemical characterization performed
with outer-sphere Ru(NH3)63+/2+ and
inner sphere Fe(CN)63–/4– redox
mediators showed quasi-reversible ET at the LIG working electrode
and fast ET kinetics with k0 of 0.014
cm/s calculated for Ru(NH3)63+/2+ for 50 ms/pix working electrodes. Practical usability of fabricated
electrodes for low cost screening of analytes was demonstrated by
the quasi-reversible ET showed with all carbon systems and by the
proof-of-concept detection of benzocaine obtained by low cost, lightweight,
and portable electrochemical readout instrumentation. These electrodes
display great potential for low cost and disposable analysis and development
of DIY flexible electrochemical platforms.

Experimental Section
Materials
Commercial polyimide films with a nominal
thickness of 80 μm were purchased from Radionics and used without
further treatment. Hexaammineruthenium(III) chloride, potassium hexacyanoferrate(III),
potassium chloride, and benzocaine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
and used without further purification. Milli-Q water (resistivity
18 MΩ cm) was used throughout the experiments.

Electrode Fabrication
LIG electrodes were fabricated
using a mini-speed laser engraving machine (Colemeter DK-8 Pro-5 Square
Haste Edition) equipped with a diode laser with a wavelength of 405
nm. Polyimide tapes fixed on glass microscope slides for support were
irradiated at 500 mW laser power and dwell times (dwell times) between
10 and 120 ms/pix. LIG electrode structures designed in Microsoft
PowerPoint were fabricated by raster scanning of the laser beam to
create the electrode pattern on the polyimide surface. Fabricated
electrodes were washed with acetone and isopropanol and dried with
a N2 gun before use.

Characterization
LIG electrodes were morphologically
characterized by using a cold-cathode field-emission scanning electron
microscope (SEM, JSM-7500F, JEOL UK Ltd.), operating at 5 kV acceleration
voltage. White light optical microscopy images of fabricated LIG electrodes
were acquired using an Axioskop II, Carl Zeiss Ltd. Microscope interfaced
to a charge-coupled detector camera (Coolsnap CF, Photometrics). LIG
height measurements were acquired using a KLA-Tencor p17 profilometer
with stylus weight of 2 mg and resolution of 4 μm.

Surface
wettability was measured by using a Dataphysics OCA 20 Wetting angle
system in air at ambient temperature by dropping distilled water droplets
(1 mm diameter) on the LIG surfaces. The average CA value was acquired
by measuring at three different positions of the same sample.

Two-terminal current–voltage measurements (±1 V, 10
mV step) were obtained under ambient conditions on transmission line
method (TLM) structures using an Agilent E5270B parameter analyzer
interfaced to a LakeShore Desert TTPX probe station. For these TLM
structures, arrays of LIG tracks were written at different dwell times,
ranging from 20 to 120 ms/pix. Each track had ∼1 mm square
LIG pads for electrical probing. Each TLM structure comprised four
collinear tracks separated by contact pads, allowing measurement of
resistance for four values of track length for each device (L1 = 225 μm, L2 = 1335 μm, L3 = 1920 μm,
and L4 = 2780 μm). The track resistance Ri between two consecutive pads could then be
related to the track length (Li) via 1  where Rc is the
contact resistance, Rs is the sheet resistance
of the sample, and W is the track width. Values for Rs and Rc were thus
obtained from linear regression of Ri versus Li.

Raman measurements were performed using
a Renishaw inVia Raman
system equipped with a 514 nm helium–neon laser. The laser
beam was focused onto the sample through a Leica 20× objective
with 0.4 NA. Acquisition time was usually 10 s and measured power
was 3 mW.

XPS measurements were carried out in an ultrahigh
vacuum chamber
with a base pressure ∼5 × 10–10 mbar
equipped with a SPECS LHS-10 hemispherical electron analyzer and a
dual anode Al/Mg X-ray gun. All XPS measurements were acquired using
the unmonochromatized Mg Kα line at 1253.6 eV and an analyzer
pass energy of 36 eV, giving a fwhm of 0.9 eV for the Au 4f7/2 peak. The XPS core level spectra were analyzed by fitting each total
spectrum to a series of individual mixed Gaussian–Lorentzian
peaks, following a Shirley background subtraction.

Electrochemical
measurements were performed with a CHI760 bi-potentiostat
electrochemical system using a Pt wire as the counter electrode, Ag/AgCl
as the reference electrode, and LIG as the working electrode. The
three electrodes were assembled in a Teflon cell (see Figure S8 for details) with a circular area of
8 mm diameter exposed to the electrolyte. CV experiments were performed
in aqueous solution using inner-sphere ([Fe(CN)6]3–/4–) and outersphere ([Ru(NH3)6]3+/2+) redox mediators at a concentration of 5 mM dissolved in 0.1 M KCl.
Solutions were purged with N2 for 30 min prior to measurements
and during measurements. HET rate constants were determined from the
anodic peak separation using the method of Nicholson32 by assuming the transfer coefficient α = 0.5 and
using the following diffusion coefficient D = 6.5
× 10–6 cm2 s–1 for [Ru(NH3)6]3+/2+. Benzocaine
electrochemical characterization was carried out with an EmStatBlue
(Palmsens) portable potentiostat at a benzocaine concentration of
5 mM dissolved in 0.1 M KCl.
