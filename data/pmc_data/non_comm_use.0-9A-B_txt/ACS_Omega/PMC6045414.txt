Cu
has recently received great interest as a potential candidate for glucose sensing
to overcome the problems with noble metals. In this work, reduced
graphene oxide-encapsulated Cu nanoparticles (Cu@RGO) have been prepared
via an electrostatic self-assembly method. This core/shell composites
were found to be more stable than conventional Cu-decorated graphene
composites and bare copper nanoparticles in an air atmosphere because
the graphene shell can effectively protect the Cu nanoparticles from
oxidation. In addition, the obtained Cu@RGO composites also showed
an outstanding electrocatalytic activity toward glucose oxidation
with a wide linear detection range of 1 μM to 2 mM, low detection
limit of 0.34 μM (S/N = 3), and a sensitivity of 150 μA mM–1 cm–2. Moreover, Cu@RGO composites exhibited a satisfactory reproducibility,
selectivity, and long effective performance. These excellent properties
indicated that Cu@RGO nanoparticles have great potential application
in glucose detection.

1 Introduction
Diabetes,
a worldwide public chronic disease, which is related
to high levels of glucose in the blood, has affected millions of people
during the past decades.1,2 In this regard, the
development of fast and reliable methods for glucose detection is
quite important in many areas, such as clinical diagnostics and food
and medicine industry.3 Among them, electrochemical
detection techniques were applied universally for glucose detection
due to their high sensitivity, stability, simple instrumentation,
and low cost.4−7 Generally, electrochemical glucose sensors can be divided into two
types: enzymatic and nonenzymatic. However, the enzymatic glucose
sensors have several inevitable disadvantages because of the intrinsic
nature of the enzyme, such as insufficient long-term stability, high
cost, and poor electrical conductivity.8,9 Moreover, the
activity of enzymes is susceptible to environmental factors (such
as temperature, pH value, and toxic chemicals).10 Therefore, nonenzyme-based glucose biosensors have become
a hot research topic in these years.

Recently, noble metal nanoparticles
(such as silver, gold, and
platinum), due to their unique catalytic activity, have attracted
a great deal of attention as nonenzymatic electrode materials in the
area of glucose sensors. However, noble materials were usually scarce
and expensive for commercial use and easily poisoned during the experimental
processes, which limited their widespread electrocatalytic applications.11−13 Therefore, replacement of noble metals with other cheaper materials
is of great importance in the field of biosensing application. Recently,
Cu nanoparticles were emerging as a new promising electrode material
for the detection of glucose and many research groups have investigated
their electrocatalyst ability.3,14,15 However, bare Cu nanoparticles in the air atmosphere easily suffered
from oxidation within several hours and therefore hampering their
long-term commercial practice.11,16 Moreover, our previous
research indicated a molecular-level mixing process to fabricate Cu-decorated
reduced graphene oxide (RGO/Cu) composites and investigated their
electrocatalytic performance for glucose detection.17 However, some papers indicated that the bare metal particles
on the graphene layer were also unstable in harsh conditions after
a period of time.18

Fortunately,
the core–shell structure can effectively immunize
the encapsulated nanomaterial against environment degradation effects.11 Compared with other coatings (organic molecules,
polymers, or oxides), carbon coating has many advantages due to its
higher electron transportations and chemical and thermal stability.19−21 Graphene, as a two-dimensional single-layer carbon sheet, has attracted
great interest to be used as a coating material for electrocatalytic
applications because of large specific surface area, extraordinary
carrier transport mobility, and excellent chemical stability.22−24 Actually, the flexible graphene can not only prevent the volume
expansion/contraction of nanoparticles but also improve the catalytic
performance due to the strong synergistic interaction between the
two components and electrical conductivity of the overall electrode.18,20 Until now, graphene-encapsulated metal nanoparticles have been widely
studied in electrochemical applications. For example, Hang et al.
fabricated Cu@RGO core/shell nanostructure arrays
using monolayer colloidal crystals as templates, which exhibited efficient
catalytic activity in the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP.25 Wang et al. prepared graphene-encapsulated nickel nanoparticles,
which showed excellent catalytic performance for the methanation reaction.26

In this work, we presented a facile strategy
to fabricate graphene-encapsulated
Cu nanoparticles by electrostatic self-assembly. It is the first time
when an electrostatic self-assembly route is developed for the fabrication of composites of Cu nanoparticles encapsulated in graphene shells
and then their electrocatalytic activity is systemically investigated
toward the oxidation of glucose. Moreover, the experimental process
for the synthesis of graphene-encapsulated Cu nanoparticles in our
case was simple and was carried out without using complicated
and expensive equipment. Generally, electrostatic self-assembly is
based on the principle of electrostatic attraction between two oppositely
charged particles suspended in the solution.27 The individual Cu nanoparticle surfaces were first modified with
3-aminoprooyltriethoxysilane (APTES) to render the surface positively
charged and then encapsulated by negatively charged graphene oxide
(GO) sheets because there were abundant oxygen-containing functional
groups (such as carboxyl, epoxy, and hydroxyl) on the GO sheets. After
reduction by sodium hypophosphite monohydrate (NaH2PO2·H2O), self-assembled graphene-encapsulated
Cu composites (Cu@RGO) were achieved. The high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM) image also verified that there were few-layer
graphene sheets covering the surface of Cu nanoparticles. Moreover,
these as-prepared Cu@RGO nanoparticles exhibited excellent catalytic
activity for glucose and air stability than those of bare Cu and RGO/Cu
composites even after 30 days, showing a great potential as high-efficiency
materials in the field of glucose sensors.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Characterizations of Structures
and Morphologies
Figure 1 shows the
schematic illustration of the synthesis of Cu@RGO composites by the
electrostatic self-assembly method. More details can be seen in the Methods section. The atomic force microscopy (AFM)
image of the as-prepared GO sheets can be seen in Figure S1a (Supporting Information). It can be seen that GO
sheets have not overlapped, and the height profile diagram showed
that the thickness of GO was 0.88 nm, which was consistent with the
typical thickness of a single-layer GO.28Figure S1c,d shows the scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images
of GO sheets. It can be seen that GO has a paperlike structure with
corrugations and ripples. The inset of Figure S1c shows a digital photo of the GO solution. Combined with
the results of AFM, indicating that the most of
GO in this work was efficiently exfoliated. Moreover, the distribution
of GO is shown in Figure S2 and the average
size of GO was 858 nm.

Figure 1 Schematic illustration of the synthesis route for graphene-encapsulated
Cu nanoparticles.

Figure 2a shows
the Raman spectra of GO and Cu@RGO. Two bands were observed at 1347
and 1595 cm–1 for GO. The former was called the
D band, which corresponded to the A1g phonon of sp3 carbon atoms of the disordered graphite. The latter was called
the G band, which originated from the in-plane vibration of sp2 carbon atoms.29,30 After reduction, the D band and
G band shifted to 1342 and 1585 cm–1, respectively,
indicating the recovery of the hexagonal network of the carbon atom
in graphene.31 Furthermore, the change
of the relative intensities of the D and G bands (ID/IG) provided
the information of the amount of structure defects and a quantitative
measure of the edge plane exposure.32 In
our case, this ratio has been found to increase from 0.711 (GO) to
1.085 (Cu@RGO), indicating the decrease in the size of the in-plane
sp2 domains and the partially ordered crystal structure
of graphene sheets.33

(b) Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra
of GO and Cu@RGO. Deconvoluted high-resolution C 1s X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of (c) GO and (d) Cu@RGO.

Figure 2b shows
the FTIR spectra of GO and Cu@RGO composites. In the spectrum of GO,
the typical peaks were as follows: 3440 and 1729 cm–1, which correspond to O–H stretching vibrations of C–OH
groups and C=O stretching vibrations from carbonyl groups.
The two peaks at 1623 and 1054 cm–1 were assigned
to the C=C configurable vibrations from aromatic zooms and
C–O vibrations from alkoxy groups.34 For the Cu@RGO composites, the peak positions of the functional
groups on GO still remained, but the intensities of C=O and
C–O decreased drastically, whereas the intensity of C=C
was much stronger than that on GO. These changes proved that most
of the oxygen-containing functional groups on GO have been successfully
removed.

Moreover, XPS was employed to further analyze the reduction
degree
of Cu@RGO. The deconvoluted XPS C 1s spectra of GO (Figure 2c) exhibited four components:
C–C/C=C (284.9 eV), C–O (286.5 eV), C=O
(287.1 eV), and O=C–OH (288.9 eV). However, the XPS
C 1s spectrum of Cu@RGO (Figure 2d) was clearly different from that of GO and the peak
intensities of oxygen-containing groups decreased significantly. Specifically,
the peak area ratios of the C–O, C=O, and O=C–OH
bonds to C–C/C=C of GO were 1.245, 0.221, and 0.103,
and the corresponding ratios for Cu@RGO were 0.041, 0.018, and 0.045,
respectively. This result indicated that the oxygenated groups on
the surface of GO sheets have been reduced.

The air stability
of Cu@RGO can be identified by X-ray diffraction
(XRD) and TEM. Figure 3 shows the XRD results of pure Cu, RGO/Cu, and Cu@RGO composites
for 30 days (the samples were denoted Cu@RGO-30, RGO/Cu-30, and pure
Cu-30, respectively). Compared to those for pure Cu and RGO@Cu composites,
no peaks of copper oxides can be seen for Cu@RGO composites, and there
were five reflection peaks located at 43.28, 50.88, 74.45, 89.72,
and 95.26°, which can be assigned to Cu (111), Cu (200), Cu (220),
Cu (311), and Cu (222) (JCPDS No. 65-9026), respectively. Obviously,
Cu@RGO has a better oxidation resistance than that of pure Cu and
RGO/Cu composites because the graphene shell could act as a shield
to prevent the metal core from oxidation.16,35 Additionally, the peak of RGO (26°) has not been found in the
Cu@RGO samples. This can be ascribed to the small loading of RGO in
the composite and the low scattering length of carbon compared to
that of copper atoms.36

Figure 4a
displays
the low-magnification TEM image of Cu@RGO nanoparticles, which showed
a typical core–shell structure due to the Cu core encapsulated
by a graphene shell. Figure 4b shows the corresponding HRTEM image and exhibited that the
Cu core still has a great crystalline structure under the protection
of the few-layer graphene shell. The lattice spacing of Cu was 0.208
nm, which was in accordance with the d-spacing of
the (111) plane of the Cu crystal. Furthermore, it can be seen that
the lattice spacing of the graphene shell was 0.37 nm, which can be
indexed to the {0002} planes of graphite.37

the Cu@RGO composites.

2.2 Electrochemical Measurements
To compare
the catalytic activity more effectively, the particle sizes of the
referential pure Cu, RGO/Cu, and Cu@RGO composites (Figure 5) used in this electrochemical
characterization were similar (≈40 nm). As shown in Figure 6a, the electrochemical
activity was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in 0.1 M NaOH
without addition of glucose. Apparently, no oxidation peak existed
in the absence of glucose, which means that all of the samples have some electrocatalytic
effect in the NaOH solution. Moreover, Figure 6b shows that some oxidation peaks appeared
in all of the samples in the case of glucose. Among all of the samples,
the Cu@RGO composite had the highest peak current for glucose oxidation
and the pure Cu had the weakest, indicating that Cu@RGO had the better
catalytic activity than that of RGO/Cu and pure Cu specimens. The
higher electrocatalytic activity of Cu@RGO can be ascribed to the
synergistic effect of Cu and graphene. This core/shell structure increased
the contact surface area between the Cu core and graphene shell because
the Cu core was wrapped all around by the graphene, which acted as
a continuous path for rapid electron transport.38 Moreover, the carrier transport efficiency could also be
improved significantly, arising from graphene encapsulation.22,39

The HRTEM image of graphene shells around the Cu nanoparticles can
be seen in (d).

Figure 6 CV curves of (a) Cu@RGO,
RGO/Cu, and pure Cu samples in the absence
of glucose in 0.1 M NaOH solution and (b) Cu@RGO, RGO/Cu, pure Cu,
Cu@RGO-30 days, RGO/Cu-30 days, and pure Cu-30 days in the presence
of 2 mM glucose in 0.1 M NaOH.

Additionally, the long-term storage and stability of the
modified
electrodes were crucial for the continuous monitoring of glucose in
practical applications. After exposure to air environment for 30 days,
all of the samples (Cu@RGO, RGO/Cu, and pure Cu) exhibited different
electrocatalytic performance toward glucose. Apparently, the Cu@RGO-30
composites still retained excellent catalytic activity, indicating
that few-layer graphene-encapsulated Cu had great long-term stability
because graphene shells could effectively protect Cu cores from oxidation
while retaining their intrinsic catalytic properties. Conversely,
the electrochemical performance of RGO/Cu-30 and pure Cu-30 decreased
significantly due to the parts of Cu nanoparticles being oxidized
to form CuO within these days, which can be observed in Figure 3. Moreover, it could
be seen that RGO/Cu-30 had better catalytic activity than that of
pure Cu-30. This was attributed to the functional groups on the surface
of GO, offering the anchoring points for metal nanoparticles. In addition,
some Cu nanoparticles were covered with graphene sheets and therefore
saved from oxidation.

Figure S3 illustrates
the mechanism
for the oxidation of glucose in the NaOH solution at the as-prepared
Cu@RGO composite electrode.40−42 First, Cu nanoparticles can be
electrochemically oxidized into Cu(II) (CuO and Cu(OH)2) in alkaline media. 1   or
2  Second,
CuO is oxidized to a strong oxidizing
agent of the Cu(III) species (CuOOH– or Cu(OH)4–). 3   or
4  Finally, glucose was catalytically oxidized
by the Cu(III) species and formed hydrolyzate gluconic acid. 5   6  Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was performed
as a more sensitive voltammetric technique to investigate the dependence
of peak current on the concentration of glucose. Before recording
the DPV voltammograms, moderate stirring was continued for about 5
min when glucose was added. Figure 7a shows a typical DPV voltammogram of various concentrations
of glucose at the Cu@RGO-modified electrodes in 0.1 M NaOH solution.
Obviously, the current responses increased linearly with glucose concentrations
in the range of 1 μM–2 mM with a current sensitivity of 150 μA
mM–1 cm–2 (Figure 7b). The corresponding regression equation
could be described as follows: y = 76.84 + 0.132Cglucose (R2 = 0.992).
The detection limit of the method was determined to be 0.34 μM
with the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of 3. Moreover, the effective
surface area of Cu@RGO electrocatalysts can be determined by CV. Figure S4 shows the CV curves of the obtained
Cu@RGO composites in 0.1 M N2-saturated NaOH solution,
and the effective surface area was estimated to be 16.81 cm2. For comparison, the performances of the as-prepared Cu@RGO and
other previously reported nonenzymatic glucose sensors based on Cu
have been listed in Table 1. As presented in Table 1, the developed Cu@RGO composites exhibited great sensitivity
and limit of determination (LOD) of glucose sensing among these electrodes.
The higher catalytic activity of as-prepared Cu@RGO core/shell nanoparticles
originated from the synergistic effect between Cu nanoparticles and
RGO, which has large specific surface area (2600 m2 g–1) and extraordinary electron transport properties.43 Besides that, the copper particle size in our
case was relatively small than that in some reports.44,45 It is well known that the nanoparticles with a smaller size have
a higher catalytic activity due to larger active surface areas.25

in 0.1 M NaOH. (b) Linear relationship between the peak current and

The reproducibility of Cu@RGO composites was investigated
from
the voltammetric response of 2 mM glucose for successive measurements
at the same 10 modified electrodes, which were prepared using the
same electrostatic self-assembly method. A relative standard deviation
of 4.2% was obtained toward 2 mM glucose, confirming an excellent
reproducibility of the fabricated electrode.

Apart from reproducibility
and stability, selectivity was also
an important feature for glucose detection. In real serum samples,
several electroactive substances, such as dopamine (DA), l-ascorbic acid (AA), and uric acid (UA), usually coexisted with glucose
and interfered the detection of glucose. Therefore, in our experiments,
the selectivity of Cu@RGO was evaluated via DPV with the addition
of 1 mM glucose in 0.1 M NaOH in the absence and presence of possible
interferences (AA, DA, and UA) for the detection of glucose. Figure 8 exhibits the exact
contrast among the above interferences, which was calculated by normalizing
the current responses of the Cu@RGO composites upon 1 mM glucose and was 100%. Instead
of adding glucose, each interference (2 mM AA, DA, and UA) was separately
added, and the corresponding DPV current decreased lightly occupied only 6.3, 8.9 and 5.4% of which originated from 1.0 mM
glucose, respectively. It could be seen that the signal intensities
after adding these interferences to the glucose solution were kept
nearly constant in the presence of interference, proving that the
Cu@RGO electrode had a great selectivity.

Figure 8 Normalized DPV peak current
changes of Cu@RGO composites with the
respective addition of 1.0 mM glucose, 2.0 mM UA, 2.0 mM DA, 2.0 mM
AA, and corresponding mixtures.

To verify the possibility of practical application, the obtained
Cu@RGO nanocomposites in this work were applied to determine glucose
in human blood serum samples. Specifically, 30 μL of the blood
sample was added to 30 mL of 0.1 M NaOH solution, and the optimal
detection potential of 0.6 V was applied to record the current responses.
From the results in Table 2, it can be seen that the results of glucose detection in
serum samples agreed well with the values obtained from the hospital-used instrument, and the
relative standard deviation (RSD) of determination was below 4%, which
implied the good accuracy of glucose.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully developed an
electrostatic self-assembly
route for the fabrication of composites of Cu nanoparticles encapsulated
in graphene shells. The obtained Cu@RGO composites showed excellent
oxidation resistance ability than that of bare Cu and RGO/Cu composites
because graphene shells can effectively protect the Cu core from oxidation.
Compared with bare Cu and RGO/Cu composites, the as-prepared Cu@RGO
composite exhibited better electrocatalytic activity toward glucose
oxidation, which showed a broad linearity of 1 μM to 2 mM with
a relatively low detection limit of 0.34 μM (S/N = 3). This
could be attributed to the strong synergistic interaction between
the Cu core and graphene shell, improved large surface area, and carrier
transport efficiency, arising from the graphene encapsulation. Furthermore,
the obtained Cu@RGO composites showed a long-term stability, great
reproducibility, and excellent sensitivity (150 μA mM–1 cm–2). Therefore, we believe that this synthesis
method can be extended to other metal/graphene core–shell structure
composites and Cu@RGO can be considered as a potential electrode for
glucose sensors in the future.

4 Methods
4.1 Materials
All of the chemicals were
of analytical grade and used without any further purification. Graphene
oxide (GO) was purchased from Nanjing XFNANO Materials Tech Co., Ltd.
NaH2PO2·H2O was obtained from
Shanghai Chemical Reagent Co. The Cu nanocomposites and Cu-decorated
graphene composites were fabricated by the chemical reduction method,
which has been discussed in detail in our previous research.17 All aqueous solutions were freshly prepared
with ultrapure water (18 MΩ cm resistance, Millipore).

4.2 Preparation of Cu@RGO
Figure 1 shows the schematic illustration
of the synthesis of Cu@RGO composites by the electrostatic self-assembly
method. The negatively charged GO suspension was added into positively
charged Cu solution and then the graphene-encapsulated Cu composites
were obtained after adding the reducing agent. In a typical process,
first, the obtained Cu nanoparticles (50 mg) were dispersed into ultrapure
water (100 mL) via ultrasonication, followed by APTES (0.3 mL) addition
into it. Next, the mixture was ultrasonically treated, magnetically
stirred, and maintained at 60 °C for 4 h and then refluxed at
100 °C for 24 h. After that, the resulting suspension was washed
with ultrapure water by filtration and dried at 50 °C in vacuum
for 24 h. Subsequently, the dried APTES-modified Cu composites were
dissolved into ultrapure water and then gradually into GO solution
(20 mL, 1 mg mL–1), which was obtained by ultrasonication
for an hour and centrifugation five times. After magnetic stirring,
the reducing agent (NaH2PO2·H2O, 0.1 g) was added into this solution to reduce GO to RGO. Finally,
the mixture was centrifuged to obtain core–shell Cu@RGO nanoparticles.

4.3 Material Characterization
Atomic
force microscopy (AFM, AXIS ULTRA DLD), scanning electron microscopy
(SEM, JEOL, 7600F), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL,
2100F) were employed to investigate the microstructure and morphology
of GO and graphene. Raman spectroscopy spectra were recorded on a
Senterra R200-L Raman system with an argon-ion (532 nm) laser source.
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded by an EQUINOX55
FTIR spectrometer with KBr as the reference. X-ray photoelectron spectra
(XPS) were recorded by employing Kratos AXIS Ultra X-ray with an Al
Kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.6 eV). X-ray
power diffraction patterns were obtained by a Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray
diffractometer with a scanning rate of 5° min–1 (Cu Kα radiation, 40 kV).

4.4 Electrochemical
Measurements
Cyclic
voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) were conducted
on a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation using a conventional three-electrode
system, where a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and a platinum wire
were used as the reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively.
The as-prepared Cu@RGO and referential sample composite-modified glassy
carbon electrodes (GCE) served as working electrodes. Nifion (perfluoridinghanated sulfonate ionomer), due to its easy
fabrication, high chemical stability, and good biocompatibility, was
used as a protective and selective coating material in this work.
The electrocatalytic activity of as-prepared composites was assessed in an electrolyte
of 0.1 M NaOH solution in the presence of 2 mM glucose by the CV technique
from −0.2 to 1.0 V with a scan rate of 100 mV s–1. DPV was applied to record the responsive signal of sensors. The
parameters were optimized as follows: potential range from −0.60
to 0.80 V (vs SCE), step potential 0.004 V, modulation amplitude 0.05
V, and modulation time 0.05 s. All tests were performed at room temperature
(25 °C).
