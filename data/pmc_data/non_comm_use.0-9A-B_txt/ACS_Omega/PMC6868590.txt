A new
energetic salt, hydrazinium 5-nitro-3-dinitromethyl-2H-pyrazole, was synthesized using 1-nitro-3-trinitromethylpyrazole
and hydrazine as raw materials and fully characterized by IR and NMR
spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and X-ray crystallography. The isomerization
of N-nitropyrazole in the reaction condition was
first reported and the possible mechanism was explained by the density
functional theory method. The salt has good density, high positive
enthalpy of formation superior to those of the RDX and HMX, and good
detonation properties comparable to those of RDX. By denitration and
isomerization reactions, the salt gains a better thermal stability
and lower sensitivity toward impact and friction compared with its
parent compound. Based on an overall energetic evaluation, the salt
has a promising future as an alternative explosive. The research also
contributes to the synthesis and application of polynitro-substituted N-heterocyclic compounds as energetic materials.

Introduction
The design and synthesis
of novel energetic materials with high
density, high energy, and acceptable sensitivity to heat, friction
(FS), and impact (IS) that are useful for a variety of explosive and
propellant formulations remain a challenge.1−3 In recent years,
five-membered N-heterocyclic compounds (azoles) have
been frequently chosen as skeletons of energetic molecules for possessing
large enthalpy of formation, high density, and achieving positive
oxygen balance (OB) easily.4−7 Meanwhile, the nitro-based moieties including nitro,
nitramino, dinitromethyl, and trinitromethyl represent the most common
energetic functional groups, which can contribute markedly to the
overall performance of energetic compounds.8−10 Therefore,
polynitro-functionalized azoles have emerged as extremely attractive
and competitive candidates for the next generation of advanced energetic
materials.

In the past few decades, a lot of effort has been
dedicated to
the design and synthesis of polynitropyrazoles,11,12 and a number of polynitropyrazoles are identified as promising candidates
for the development of new energetic materials, such as 3,4,5-trinitropyrazole,13 3,4,5-trinitro-1-(nitromethyl)-1H-pyrazole,14 3,4-dinitro-N-(2,2,2-trinitroethyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-amine,15 and 3,5-dinitro-1-(trinitromethyl)pyrazole (Figure 1).16 Previously, we have reported the synthesis of C-trinitromethyl-substituted
pyrazoles by the reaction of N2O4 with pyrazolecarbaldehyde
oxime.17 Among them, 1-nitro-3-trinitromethylpyrazole
exhibits not only the highest density and detonation performance but
also a poor thermal stability and the highest sensitivity to impact
and friction, which is the result of the combined effect of trinitromethyl
and nitramine groups.18,19 Given the established instability
of trinitromethyl group at high temperature, the dinitromethyl with
a coplanar geometric structure is expected to give rise to a better
stability as well as a lower sensitivity.20 Interestingly, the denitration reactions of trinitromethyl groups
attached to imidazoles, triazoles, and tetrazoles into the corresponding
dinitromethylide salts by the treatment with hydrazine and hydroxylamine
have been reported.21−23 Based on these successful examples, 1-nitro-3-trinitromethylpyrazole
was subject to attempted analogical conversion. On the other hand,
C-nitropyrazoles are more stable than N-nitropyrazoles
due to the higher bond dissociation energy of C–NO2 in the former. Conventionally, the isomerization of N-nitropyrazole to C-nitropyrazole occurs by thermal rearrangement
in high boiling solvents (chlorobenzene, anisole, xylene, mesitylene,
n-decane, N-methylformamide, propylene glycol, benzonitrile, etc.)
at high temperatures (120–190 °C) for a long time (3–7
h).24−26 Given these backgrounds, 1-nitro-3-trinitromethylpyrazole
was projected to undergo denitration and isomerization to gain a better
stability and lower sensitivity; meanwhile, too much of a detonation
performance penalty should also be avoided.

Figure 1 Examples of energetic
polynitropyrazole compounds.

In our continuing efforts to prepare new high-performance polynitro
compounds, we now report the design and synthesis of a new dinitromethylpyrazole
salt using 1-nitro-3-trinitromethylpyrazole and hydrazine as raw materials,
in which denitration and isomerization reactions occur simultaneously.
The new compound, hydrazinium 5-nitro-3-dinitromethyl-2H-pyrazole, was fully characterized and the possible reaction mechanism
was also explained by the density functional theory (DFT) method.
Finally, its physicochemical and energetic properties were determined
either empirically or theoretically, highlighting the salt as a promising
alternative explosive.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
In the
synthesis pathway of our target compound 3 (Scheme 1), the intermediate,
1-nitro-3-trinitromethylpyrazole (2), was obtained through
our previous procedures, in which 3-pyrazolecarbaldehyde
was chosen as the starting material.17 Then,
compound 2 was treated with hydrazine at room temperature
to obtain its dinitromethylide salt based on the previous analogical
reactions in other azoles. In addition to the successful denitration
of the trinitromethyl group, the N–NO2 group was
also observed to migrate to C(5) atom, resulting in the generation
of an unexpected product, hydrazinium 5-nitro-3-dinitromethyl-2H-pyrazole.

Scheme 1 Synthesis Route of Compound 3
To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first report of the isomerization
of N-nitropyrazole in this manner, which distinctly
differs from the conventional thermal rearrangement method. This discovery
may provide a convenient chemistry procedure for the synthesis of
C-nitropyrazole derivatives, overcoming the limitations and drawbacks
of the current method such as tedious work-up, use of obnoxious solvents,
rearrangements at higher temperature, and safety problems.

Isomerization
Mechanism
To deeply understand the possible
isomerization mechanism, we performed a theoretical investigation
using Gaussian 16 program package27 on
the four designed reaction pathways that involve two different reactants,
1-nitro-3-trinitromethylpyrazole and 1-nitro-3-dinitromethylpyrazole
anion, to effect the removal of nitronium ion. Each reactant has two
kinds of reaction pathways. In the first kind of pathway, the proton
migrates first and subsequently the (N-)NO2 group shifts
to the adjacent carbon atom. More specifically, the proton on the
C(5) atom migrates first to the nearest oxygen atom in the nitramino
group and then the (N-)NO2 bond rotates, causing a proton
to shift to N(2), and finally the (N-)NO2 group shifts
to the adjacent C(5) atom. In the second kind of pathway, the migration
sequence is opposite. The (N-)NO2 group shifts to the C(5)
atom initially and then the proton transfers to N(2) by the way of
N(1).

The reaction pathways A and B belong to the first migration
method, which start from 1-nitro-3-trinitromethylpyrazole and 1-nitro-3-dinitromethylpyrazole
anion, respectively (Figures 2 and 3). They are thermodynamically
favorable and release free energies of 68.9 and 132.8 kJ mol–1, respectively. They are very difficult to realize because the effective
barriers from reactants to the transition states with the highest
free energies are 432.5 and 444.1 kJ mol–1, respectively.
Therefore, the first migration manner with extremely high activation
energy barriers is not feasible in the view of dynamics.

The reaction pathway C starting from 1-nitro-3-trinitromethylpyrazole
is shown in Figure 4, in which the (N-)NO2 group shifts before the migration
of the proton. The intermediate 5-nitro-3-trinitromethyl-1H-pyrazole unreasonably possesses a lower free energy (−76.2
kJ mol–1) than that of the product 5-nitro-3-trinitromethyl-2H-pyrazole (−68.9 kJ mol–1). In
addition, the effective energy barrier is 180.3 kJ mol–1. When the reaction pathway D (Figure 5) starts from 1-nitro-3-dinitromethylpyrazole anion,
the intermediate 5-nitro-3-dinitromethyl-1H-pyrazole
anion has a higher free energy (−69.0 kJ mol–1) than that of the product 5-nitro-3-dinitromethyl-2H-pyrazole anion (−132.8 kJ mol–1). It reveals
that 5-nitro-3-dinitromethyl-2H-pyrazole anion is
thermodynamically favorable. Besides, it only crosses an effective
barrier of 155.2 kJ mol–1 which is the lowest among
the four reaction pathways. Above all, the reaction pathway D is the
most possible reaction pathway, namely, the denitration reaction occurs
before the isomerization and then the (N-)NO2 group shifts
before the migration of the proton for the formation of compound 3.

Compound 3 crystallizes
in the triclinic space group P1̅ with two molecules
per unit cell and has a calculated
density of 1.874 g cm–3 at 153 K. The crystal structure
of 3 consists of one hydrazine cation and one 5-nitro-3-dinitromethyl-2H-pyrazole anion. Of note, the proton is bonded to N3 rather
than N4 atom of the pyrazole ring as supported by the X-ray molecular
structure. The C1–C2, C2–C3, C3–N3, N3–N4,
and C1–N4 bond lengths are 1.391, 1.398, 1.368, 1.345, and
1.337 Å, respectively, which are in the normal range.28 The C1–N5 bond length is 1.436 Å,
which is slightly shorter than a standard C–N single bond (1.460
Å).29 In addition, the C4–N1
and C4–N2 bond lengths of the dinitromethyl group are 1.396
and 1.403 Å, respectively, and thus are both much shorter than
those of the normal C–N single bonds and the analogous bonds
in its parent compound 2 whose average value is 1.535
Å. This can be explained by the change in the electron density
distribution after the removal of a nitro substituent of the trinitromethyl
group. The remaining atoms of the dinitromethyl group are inclined
to form a plane with the torsion angles O4–N2–C4–N1
= −6.268° and O2–N1–C4–N2 = −0.113°.
Meanwhile, the dinitromethyl group also lies in the plane of the pyrazole
ring (N2–C4–C3–N3 = 1.02° and C2–C3–C4–N1
= 4.76°), illustrating that the 5-nitro-3-dinitromethyl-2H-pyrazole anion is a coplanar structure.

In this work, the differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) and thermogravimetry
(TG) technologies were employed to determine the thermal stability
of the salt 3. The tests were performed by the samples
of 0.5 mg in covered Al containers scanning at 5 °C min–1 under dry, oxygen-free nitrogen over the temperature range from
25 to 500 °C. As shown from the DSC curve of 3 (Supporting
Information Figure S3), there is only one
exothermic process with an onset temperature of 128.5 °C and
a peak temperature of 180.2 °C, which corresponds to the thermal
decomposition of 3. Compared with its parent compound 2, 3 displays a better thermal stability owing
to the conversion of the unstable trinitromethyl group into dinitromethylide
salt.

Oxygen balance (OB), which indicates the degree to which
an explosive
can be oxidized, has an important and direct effect on the sensitivity,
strength, and brisance of an explosive. On the basic carbon monoxide
(CO), compound 3 exhibits a negative OB value of −9.64%,
which is higher than that of TNT (−24.7%) but inferior to those
of RDX and HMX (0%).

Heat of formation (HOF) is one of the important
characteristics
of energetic salts, which is directly related to the number of nitrogen–nitrogen
bond in an ionic species. The calculations of HOF were performed by
the isodesmic reaction30 using Gaussian
16 suite of programs. The HOF of compound 3 was estimated
to be 194.8 kJ mol–1, which was more positive than
those of RDX (92.6 kJ mol–1) and HMX (116.1 kJ mol–1). The high positive HOF mainly derives from its high
nitrogen content.

Density is an important parameter in evaluating
the performance
of energetic compounds. According to the Kamlet–Jacobs equation,31−33 the detonation pressure (P) depends on the square
of the density, and the detonation velocity (D) is
proportional to the density. The density of compound 3 was measured using a gas pycnometer at room temperature, and its
density was 1.80 g cm–3, which is quite close to
that of RDX (1.81 g cm–3). Moreover, the density
falls within the acceptable range for new high-performance energetic
materials (1.8–2.0 g cm–3).

With the
calculated value of HOF and the experimental value of
density at ambient temperature, the detonation pressure (P) and detonation velocity (D) of energetic salt 3 were calculated using EXPLO5 program (version 6.01).34 The calculated detonation pressure and velocity
are 33.8 GPa and 8790 m s–1, respectively, which
are remarkably superior to those of TNT (21.3 GPa, 7300 m s–1) and very similar to those of RDX (34.9 GPa, 8795 m s–1).

The sensitivities of compound 3 toward impact
(IS)
and friction (FS) were determined using a BAM drop hammer apparatus
and a BAM friction tester, respectively. Compared with compound 2, compound 3 exhibits significantly lower sensitivities
toward impact and friction. Compound 3 has an impact
sensitivity (7 J) comparable to that of HMX, while its friction sensitivity
(192 N) is lower than those of HMX and RDX.

Conclusions
A new energetic salt, hydrazinium 5-nitro-3-dinitromethyl-2H-pyrazole, has been synthesized by the reaction of 1-nitro-3-trinitromethylpyrazole
with hydrazine. The new compound was fully characterized and the isomerization
mechanism of N-nitropyrazole in the process was also
explained by the density functional theory (DFT) method. The discovery
may contribute significantly to the development of rational synthesis
methods of C-nitropyrazoles as well as other polynitro-substituted
azoles. Subsequently, the physicochemical and energetic properties
of the energetic salt were both measured and calculated theoretically.
The enthalpy of formation of the salt was calculated using Gaussian
16 programs with a result of 194.8 kJ mol–1, which
was significantly superior to those of RDX and HMX. The salt possesses
excellent detonation properties (D = 8790 m s–1, P = 33.8 GPa), which are comparable to those of
RDX. In the terms of stability toward thermal, impact, and friction,
the energetic salt displays a better thermal stability and a lower
sensitivity than its parent compound 2 on account of
the formations of dinitromethylide salt and C–NO2 group. Based on an overall energetic evaluation, compound 3 can serve as a promising alternative explosive.

Experimental
Section
General Caution
Although none of the compounds described
herein exploded or detonated in the course of this research, these
energetic materials should be handled with extreme care using best
safety practices (including the use of personal protective equipment
such as leather gloves, face shield, and ear plugs).

Materials and
Measurements
All starting materials were
commercially available and used as received. IR spectra were obtained
from KBr pellets using a Nicolet Magna IR 560 spectrophotometer (Madison)
over the range of 4000–400 cm–1. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ARX-400
instrument (Zurich, Switzerland). Chemical shifts are reported in
ppm relative to tetramethylsilane. Elemental analyses (C, H, and N)
were performed using an Elementar Vario EL (Bremen, Germany). Crystal
structures were determined on a Rigaku RAXIS IP diffractometer (Rigaku
Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) with the SHELXTL crystallographic software
package of molecular structure. The melting and decomposition points
of the compound were determined using a TA–DSC Q2000 differential
scanning calorimeter (New Castle, DE). Densities were measured at
25 °C using a Micromeritics Accupyc II 1340 gas pycnometer. The
impact and friction sensitivity measurements were carried out with
a BAM fall hammer apparatus (BFH-10) and a BAM friction apparatus
(FSKM-10), respectively.

Computational Methods
The quantum
chemistry calculations
were performed using Gaussian 16 suite of programs.27 The electronic structures were calculated by the B3LYP35,36 (a hybrid density functional method) and MP237 (the second-order Moller–Plesset perturbation theory)
methods. The two basis sets, 6-31G* and 6-311+G**,38 were combined with these methods. The reactants, intermediates,
and products locate at the local minimum points of the potential energy
surface without any imaginary frequency. The transition states locate
at the first-order saddle points of the potential energy surface with
only one imaginary frequency. The potential energy surfaces of the
isomerization mechanism were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G* level.
For the calculation of the enthalpy of formation, the geometric optimization
of the structures and frequency analyses employed the B3LYP/6-311+G**
level and single point energies were calculated at the MP2/6-311+G**
level. The enthalpy of each isodesmic reaction was obtained by combining
the MP2/6-311+G** energy difference for the reaction, the scaled zero
point energies (B3LYP/6-311+G**) and other thermal factors (B3LYP/6-311+G**).
Using the enthalpy of formation and density, detonation performances
were calculated using EXPLO5 v6.01 program34 according to the Kamlet–Jacobs equations.31−33
