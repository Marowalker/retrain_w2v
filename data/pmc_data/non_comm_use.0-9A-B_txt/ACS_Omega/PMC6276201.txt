Traditional
chemotherapeutics used in cancer therapy do not preferentially
accumulate in tumor tissues. The conjugation to delivery vehicles
like antibodies or small molecules has been proposed as a strategy
to increase the tumor uptake and improve the therapeutic window of
these drugs. Here, we report the synthesis and the biological evaluation
of a novel small molecule–drug conjugate (SMDC) comprising
a high-affinity bidentate acetazolamide derivative, targeting carbonic
anhydrase IX (CAIX), and cryptophycin, a potent microtubule destabilizer.
The biological activity of the novel SMDC was evaluated in vitro,
measuring binding to the CAIX antigen by surface plasmon resonance
and cytotoxicity against SKRC-52 cells. In vivo studies showed a delayed
growth of tumors in nude mice bearing SKRC-52 renal cell carcinomas.

1 Introduction
Most
cytotoxic compounds, which are used for cancer chemotherapy,
do not accumulate selectively at the site of the disease.1,2 The suboptimal biodistribution properties of these drugs limit clinical
efficacy and may cause severe side effects.3 Antibodies and small molecules that are able to bind accessible
tumor-associated antigens have been proposed as carriers to deliver
cytotoxic payloads to the tumor site. The corresponding products are
called antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) and small molecule–drug
conjugates (SMDCs), respectively.4 Four
ADCs (Kadcyla, Adcetris, Besponsa, and Mylotarg) have been approved
for cancer treatment.5

The prolonged
circulatory half-life of ADC products can induce
side effects as a result of premature release of the payload. In addition,
challenges related to the preparation of ADCs with homogenous drug–antibody
ratio, as well as high manufacturing cost, may hinder ADC development.6 SMDC products may represent an alternative to
ADCs.7 Their small size facilitates rapid
and uniform diffusion into tissues,8 potentially
reaching high tumor/organ ratios at earlier time points. Lower cost-of-goods,9 lack of immunogenicity,10 amenability to chemical synthesis, and easier analytical characterization
may represent opportunities for SMDC development compared to ADCs.
Promising results from nuclear medicine studies and preclinical experiments
have been obtained with certain ligands of folate receptors,11 prostate-specific membrane antigen,12 somatostatin receptors,13 and carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX),3,7,14 indicating that it is possible to target different
types of tumors with small organic compounds.

Carbonic anhydrase
IX (CAIX) is a transmembrane protein virtually
absent in most of the healthy human tissues, with the exception of
certain gastrointestinal structures.15,16 CAIX represents
an ideal target for SMDC development since its expression is enhanced
in tumor hypoxia and certain cancer types. A growing body of evidence
indicates that binding of antibodies or small ligands to CAIX does
not induce receptor internalization.3,17−22 We have recently reported the discovery of a noninternalizing acetazolamide
derivative from a DNA-encoded library and its use as a delivery vehicle
for tumor targeting.7,23 An SMDC product based on this
ligand, called AAZ+, showed a comparable in vivo activity
to an ADC targeting the same antigen.7 Moreover,
we could show that the anticancer activity of the SMDC can be enhanced
by the combination of immune-oncology drugs like antibody–cytokine
fusion proteins.14

Not only the ligands
but also the linker–payload combination
is significant for the development of efficacious targeted cytotoxic
products.24,25 In fact, the failure of early ADCs and SMDCs
was partially due to the insufficient potency of the chosen payloads.
The importance of using more potent cytotoxic agents has been recognized,
prompting research in the identification of highly active drugs. Indeed,
since the tumor-targeting performance of AAZ and AAZ+ decreases
at doses above 250 nmol/kg, our groups have searched for cytotoxic
payloads, which could potentially outperform conventional drugs used
in ADC and SMDC research.

Cryptophycins (Figure 1) are cyclic depsipeptides with a bacterial
origin, which
show promise as payloads to be used in targeted therapy.26 Cryptophycins display a very high cytotoxicity
(typically in the low picomolar range) on a broad variety of cancer
cells, including multidrug-resistant ones.27 Initial studies focused on the total synthesis and application of
cryptophycins as traditional chemotherapeutics, but disappointing
results in monotherapy phase II clinical trials prompted a focus shift
toward ligand-based pharmacodelivery approaches.28,29 However, the parental compound lacks an addressable functional group
for the conjugation to a homing device. Therefore, research has been
focused on the generation of cryptophycin derivatives that can be
conjugated and subsequently released, preserving the potent cytotoxicity
of the parent compound.30−33

Figure 1 Structures of cryptophycin-52 (1), cryptophycin-55
(2), and cryptophycin-55 glycinate (3).

The para position of the aromatic
ring of unit A has proven to
be a suitable position to be modified, and ADCs using this anchoring
point have been produced.34−37 Another position that can be modified is the epoxide
of unit A. Although this site plays an essential role for the high
cytotoxicity, it tolerates certain modifications. Cytotoxicity is
retained upon epoxide opening with HCl to give a chlorohydrin, presumably
due to the epoxide-forming reverse reaction under physiological conditions.
Hence, the secondary alcohol of the chlorohydrin permits conjugation
to the homing device, since esterification is an elegant way to stabilize
the compound while retaining the cytotoxicity.38

2 Results and Discussion
The use of cryptophycin
payloads has been studied for the preparation
of ADCs, but in vivo applications of cryptophycin–SMDC have
not yet been reported. For this reason, we embarked on a project aiming
at the synthesis and biological evaluation of a conjugate bearing
a bidentate acetazolamide ligand, cleavable Val-Cit dipeptide with para-aminobenzyl self-immolative part, and cryptophycin-55
glycinate as a payload, and studied its biological effect. Cryptophycin-55
glycinate (3) was prepared as previously described with
slight modifications.38 The cleavable linker 4 was prepared starting from Fmoc-Val-Cit-PAB; the Fmoc group
was removed and a triethylene glycol spacer containing a maleimide
moiety was coupled to increase the solubility of the conjugate and
allow the conjugation to the acetazolamide moiety via Michael addition.
Then, the alcohol of the para-aminobenzyl moiety
was activated with bis(4-nitrophenyl) carbonate and the linker 4 was obtained in good yield and purity. Next, linker 4 was coupled to cryptophycin-55 glycinate (3) via carbamate linkage obtaining 5 with satisfactory
yield (73%) and purity (Scheme 1). Conjugation of 5 to the acetazolamide ligand 6 yielded the final conjugate 7 (48%) in excellent
purity.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of an Acetazolamide–Cryptophycin Conjugate
Reagents and conditions: (a) N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA), dimethylformamide
(DMF), room temperature (RT), 3 h; (b) Tris buffered saline (TBS),
DMF, RT, o.n.

The affinity of the novel SMDC
(7) to recombinant
human CAIX was determined using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (Figure 2). Conjugate 7 was bound in a concentration-dependent manner to immobilized
CAIX in agreement with previous data obtained using similar derivatives
of AAZ+ (i.e., we could calculate an apparent binding constant
of 3.4 nM for AAZ+-ValCit-Cry55gly, similar to the KD value previously reported for AAZ+-ValCit-MMAE).7,14

Figure 2 SPR analysis: binding of acetazolamide–cryptophycin
conjugate 5 to immobilized CAIX.

An in vitro cytotoxicity cell-based assay was performed using
the
cell line SKRC-52 (Figure 3). The unmodified payload 3 showed a cytotoxicity
in the low nanomolar range (IC50 = 7.9 nM). Indeed, cryptophycin-55
glycinate was remarkably less potent than expected when compared to
other cell lines.39 Monomethyl auristatin
E (MMAE) using the same cell line and protocol showed a IC50 of 1.5 nM.24 As expected, conjugate 7 showed a decreased cytotoxicity compared to the unmodified
drug, proving the prodrug behavior characteristic of noninternalizing
conjugates.

and compound 7 on the SKRC-52 tumor cells.

The antitumor activity of compound 7 was investigated
in vivo in nude mice bearing subcutaneous SKRC-52 renal cell carcinomas
(Figure 4). An optimal
and safe dose corresponding to 250 nmol/kg was determined on the basis
of dose-escalation studies in nude mice (Supporting Information Figure S5) and previously published biodistribution
studies.24 Mice treated with compound 7 enjoyed a therapeutic benefit with a slower tumor growth,
especially during the treatment (p = 0.05 at day
14), compared with the control group (saline). In comparison to the
lead compound featuring MMAE as the payload administered at the same
dose, the therapeutic activity was significantly inferior. Under these
experimental conditions, neither acute toxicity nor significant loss
of weight could be observed for mice treated with the compounds bearing
either cryptophycin or MMAE as the payload.

conjugates 7 and 8 (250 nmol/kg). (A) Tumor

study. Intravenous administration of the corresponding compound is
indicated by the arrows.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we have generated
a novel cryptophycin–acetazolamide
conjugate targeting CAIX. The SMDC product showed excellent affinity
to the target and a noninternalizing behavior in an in vitro cytotoxicity
assay. The compound exhibited a moderate antitumor effect in vivo,
which was, however, inferior to that of an analogous compound based
on MMAE as the payload. The lower therapeutic activity observed with
the cryptophycin-55 glycinate, compared to that of the MMAE conjugate,
correlates with the lower in vitro potency of the corresponding free
drugs and provides a motivation to search for more potent cryptophycin
derivatives.

was added, and the solution was stirred overnight at RT. Then, the
solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue was purified
by reversed-phase (RP)-HPLC (method P1) to yield cryptophycin-55 glycinate
trifluoroacetate salt (63.4 mg, 82% yield) as a white powder after

4.2.2 Maleimide-PEG4-Val-Cit-PAB-PNP
(4)
Fmoc-Val-Cit-PABOH (500 mg, 0.83 mmol) was
dissolved in N-methyl pyrrolidone (10 mL), diethylamine
(2 mL) was added, and the solution was stirred overnight at room temperature.
Then, the solvent was removed under high vacuum and the obtained oil
was resuspended in DCM. The suspension was placed in an ultrasonic
bath for 10 min; the solid was filtered off, washed with DCM, and
dried in high vacuum to yield H-Val-Cit-PABOH as a beige solid (260
mg, 82% yield).

Maleimide-PEG4-OH (190 mg, 0.55 mmol,
1.2 equiv) and DIPEA (321 μL, 1.85 mmol, 4 equiv) were premixed
in DMF (6.5 mL) and added to H-Val-Cit-PAB (175 mg, 0.46 mmol, 1 equiv).
HATU (209 mg, 0.55 mmol, 1.2 equiv) and HOAt (75 mg, 0.55 mmol, 1.2
equiv) were dissolved in DMF (6.5 mL) and added to the reaction mixture.
The solution was stirred at room temperature for 2 h, and then, the
solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The product was taken
up in MeOH, the solution filtered off, and the filtrate purified by
column chromatography using DCM/MeOH (8:2) as an eluent to provide
Maleimide-PEG4-Val-Cit-PABOH as a yellow oil (215 mg, 66%
yield).

Maleimide-PEG4-Val-Cit-PABOH (120 mg, 0.17
mmol, 1 equiv)
was dissolved in anhydrous DMF (1.5 mL), and bis(4-nitrophenyl) carbonate
(103 mg, 0.34 mmol, 2 equiv) and DIPEA (45 μL, 0.26 mmol, 1.5
equiv) were added. The solution was stirred at room temperature for
3 h, and then, the solvents were removed under reduced pressure. The
product was purified by column chromatography using DCM/MeOH (9:1)
as an eluent to obtain 2 as a slightly yellowish solid
(95 mg, 64% yield). LC–MS (method A): tr = 8.61 min, 92% purity (λ = 220 nm). m/z calcd for [C40H54N7O15]+: 872.37 [M + H]+; found:
872.36.

4.2.3 Maleimide-PEG4-Val-Cit-PABC-Cry55-gly
(5)
3 (8.7 mg, 9.94 μmol,
1 equiv) and 4 (9.5 mg, 10.90 μmol, 1.1 equiv)
were dissolved in DMF (0.5 mL), DIPEA (5.2 μL, 29.82 μmol,
3 equiv) was added, and the solution was stirred at room temperature
for 3 h. Then, it was directly purified by RP-HPLC (method P1); fractions
containing the desired product were freeze-dried to afford 5 as a white powder (10.9 mg, 73% yield). LC–MS (method A): tr = 10.52 min, >99% purity (λ = 220
nm), m/z calcd for [C72H99Cl2N9O21]2+: 747.82 [M+2H]2+; found: 747.82.

4.2.4 AAZ+ (6)
Compound 6 was synthesized as previously reported.7

4.2.5 AAZ+-ValCit-Cry55gly (7)
Compound 6 (3.6 mg, 2.51 μmol, 2.5
equiv) was dissolved in 500 μL of degassed TBS (pH 7.4). Compound 5 (1.5 mg, 1.00 μmol, 1.0 equiv) was added as a DMF
solution (500 μL), and the reaction mixture was stirred at room
temperature overnight. The crude mixture was diluted in 500 μL
of H2O and 500 μL of CH3CN, and purified
by RP-HPLC (method P2). Product-containing fractions were identified
by high-resolution mass spectrometry and lyophilized overnight to
afford 7 (AAZ+-ValCit-Cry55gly; 1.4 mg, 48%
yield). LC–MS (method B): tr =
3.51 min, >99% purity (λ = 260 nm), m/z calcd for [C128H174Cl2N26O43S3]2+: 1464.5378

[M + 3H]3+; found: 976.6956

4.3 Surface
Plasmon Resonance
Surface
plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments were performed at room temperature
using a Biacore S200 instrument (GE Healthcare). CM5 chips (Series
S) and filtered phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4 with dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) (5% v/v) as a flow buffer were used for all experiments.
Human CAIX was immobilized on the chip to 500 response units (R.U.)
using EDC·HCl and NHS according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Serial dilutions of compound 7 (AAZ+-ValCit-Cry55gly) in a running buffer at a flow rate of 20
μL/min were used as analytes. The chip surface was regenerated
after each cycle by a short treatment with DMSO (50% v/v) in PBS.
Sensorgrams were solvent-corrected and the binding kinetics was analyzed
with the Biacore S200 evaluation software using the 1:1 Langmuir binding
model.

4.4 Cell Culture and In Vitro Cytotoxicity Assay
The human renal cell carcinoma cell line SKRC-52 was kindly provided
by Professor E. Oosterwijk (Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre,
Nijmegen, The Netherlands). Upon thawing, cells were maintained in
culture-full growth medium (Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)
added with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1% antibiotic–antimycotic;
Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. When reaching 90%
confluence, cells were detached using trypsin–ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) 0.05% (Invitrogen) and re-seeded at a dilution of 1:6.

SKRC-52 cells were seeded in 96-well plates in RPMI added with
10% FCS (100 μL) at a density of 5 × 103 cells/well.
The medium was replaced after 24 h with fresh medium containing different
concentrations of test substance (starting concentration of 100 nM,
1:2 dilution steps), and plates were incubated under standard culture
conditions. After 72 h, the medium was removed, MTS cell viability
dye (20 μL, Promega) was added in 150 μL of fresh medium,
the plates were incubated for 2 h under standard culture conditions,
and the absorbance at 490 nm was measured on a Spectra Max Paradigm
multimode plate reader (Molecular Devices; background correction was
performed by measuring the absorbance at 630 nm). Experiments were
performed in triplicates, and the average cell viability was calculated
as measured background-corrected absorbance divided by the absorbance
of untreated control wells. IC50 values were determined
by fitting data to the four-parameter logistic equation, using Prism
7 software (GraphPad Software) for data analysis.

4.5 Animal Studies
The animal studies
were performed in accordance with Swiss animal welfare laws and regulations
(license number 27/2015, granted by Veterinäramt des Kantons
Zürich).

4.5.1 Tumor Implantation
SKRC-52 cells
were grown as described above to 80% confluence and detached with
trypsin–EDTA 0.05% (Life Technologies). Cells were rinsed once
with Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS, pH 7.4), and counted
and suspended again in HBSS to give a final concentration of 3.4 ×
107 cells/mL. Aliquots of 5 × 106 cells
(150 μL of the suspension) were injected subcutaneously into
the right flank of athymic BALB/c nu/nu mice (8–10 weeks old
females, Janvier).

4.5.2 Dose Escalation
Athymic BALB/c
nu/nu mice (females, 8–10 weeks old, no tumors, Janvier) were
injected intravenously with different doses of compound 7 (AAZ+-ValCit-Cry55gly; 10, 25, 125, 250, and 500 nmol/kg; n = 1 per group) five times, once every two days (starting
from day 1; Figure S5). None of the doses
tested resulted in a significant acute body weight loss.

4.5.3 Therapy Experiment
Tumors were
allowed to grow to an average volume of 75 mm3. Three groups
(5 mice each) were formed randomly. The treatment was started by intravenously
injecting a solution of AAZ+-ValCit-Cry55gly (compound 7), AAZ+-ValCit-MMAE (compound 8),
or vehicle (PBS containing 1% of DMSO) (lateral tail vein) at 250
nmol/kg. All compounds were prepared and injected as solutions in
sterile PBS containing 1% DMSO. The mice were weighed, and the tumor
sizes were monitored daily with an electronic caliper. Tumor volume
calculation was done by multiplying (long side) × (short side)
× (short side) × 0.5. Once the termination criteria were
reached, the animals were sacrificed. GraphPad Prism 7 was used for
data analysis (regular two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni test).
