New 1,2-dihydropyridine (1,2-DHP)-based
fluorophores 1a–1h were designed and synthesized
by a one-pot four-component condensation
reaction using dienaminodioate, aldehydes, and an in situ-generated
hydrazone mediated by trifluoroacetic acid. The photophysical properties
of 1,2-DHPs were studied in detail, and a few of them exhibited selective
mitochondrial staining ability in HeLa cell lines (cervical cancer
cells). A detailed photophysical investigation led to the design of
1,2-DHP 1h as an optimal fluorophore suitable for its
potential application as a small molecule probe in the aqueous medium.
Also, 1,2-DHP 1h exhibited sixfold enhanced emission
intensity than its phosphorylated analogue 1h′ in the long wavelength region (λem ≈ 600
nm), which makes 1,2-DHP 1h′ meet the requirement
as a bioprobe for protein tyrosine phosphatases, shown in L6 muscle
cell lysate.

Introduction
Small molecule-based
organic fluorophores are essential for sensing
and imaging of biological specimens with high sensitivity and fast
response.1 Even though a large variety
of fluorophores are known, only a few have optimal performance because
a majority of them often suffer from photobleaching, autofluorescence,
and cytotoxic behavior that limit their further applications in biology.2 A number of heterocyclic fluorophores were reported
for fluorescent labeling of biomolecules, sensing, and bioimaging
applications; however, for most of these molecules, the emission maxima
were observed in the green window of less than 500 nm.3 Consequently, the discovery of new heterocyclic fluorophore
scaffolds with improved photophysical properties is highly warranted.
Fluorescent properties exhibited by 1,4-dihydropyridines (1,4-DHPs)4 and our recent interest in 1,2-dihydropyridines
(1,2-DHPs)5 have inspired us to develop
new 1,2-DHP-based fluorophores with improved photophysical features.

1,4-DHPs are known to exhibit blue fluorescence with appropriately
substituted electron-donating groups at the 1-position and electron-withdrawing
groups at 3- and 5-positions (Figure 1).6 Furthermore, a higher
Stokes shift was observed by the presence of an electron-donating
aryl system in the 4-position of 1,4-DHP, which is attributed to an
internal charge transfer in the excited state between the two π-systems.7 The 4-aryl-substituted 1,4-DHP comprising two
different chromophores separated by an sp3 carbon served
as a tunable photoactivated dyad involving energy and electron transfer
processes between them (Figure 1).8 The fluorophore ability of
1,4-DHP was further extended as a chemosensor where a water-soluble
glucopyranosyl 1,4-DHP is used in the detection of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol.9 1,2-DHPs, however, were not explored in detail
for their photophysical properties to an extent as that of 1,4-DHPs,
but 2-pyridones, which are structural analogues of 1,2-DHPs, were
recently reported as fluorescent probes.10 Recently, ylidenemalononitrile enamines were reported as fluorescent
“turn-on” indicators for their ability to undergo cyclization
with 1° amines to produce fluorescent 1,2-DHP products.11

Figure 1 Design strategy of the N-benzylideneamine-appended
1,2-DHP-based fluorophore.

In the quest for developing new fluorophores with improved
photophysical
properties, herein, we have explored 1,2-DHPs with an extended π-conjugation
as novel fluorophores. As N-phenyl-1,2-DHPs absorb
in the near UV region (Table S1), the corresponding
derivatives with absorption in the visible region would be preferred
for biological applications. Hence, the present 1,2-DHP design (Figure 1) involves a push–pull
system with different electron-rich N-benzylideneamine
substitutions that offer tuning of their photophysical behavior.12 This new N-benzylideneamine-appended
1,2-DHP offered a remarkable bathochromic shift in the absorption
and emission profiles with large Stokes shifts (Table 1). The application of these fluorophores
was demonstrated as selective mitochondrial staining agents in HeLa
cells. Furthermore, the design offers different sites for appendage
to bioactives or functionalities required for conjugation, and such
applicability has been demonstrated here as a probe for protein tyrosine
phosphatase (PTP) enzymes in L6 muscle cell lysate.

Results and Discussions
Synthesis
We have recently reported a one-pot multicomponent
synthesis of 1,2-DHPs from dienaminodioate and imines, generated from
aromatic aldehydes and amines, mediated by trifluoroacetic acid at
room temperature.5 As an extension of this
methodology, the aromatic amine is replaced with an in situ-generated
hydrazone, and by condensation with other components, the expected N-benzylideneamine-appended 1,2-DHP was observed under mild
conditions, thus serving as a facile one-pot four-component reaction
(Scheme 1). A series
of 1,2-DHPs 1a–1g were synthesized in moderate
to good yields (20–60%) by utilizing hydrazones of differing
electronic properties to decipher their photophysical properties (Scheme 1). 1,2-DHPs 1a–1b were prepared to assess the role of phenyl substitution
in the 6-position. The remaining 1,2-DHPs 1c–1g were synthesized with acetaldehyde to evaluate the effect of the
phenyl group as a contributing factor behind 1,2-DHP’s fluorophore
ability. This methodology offers a choice of appending any aliphatic
or aromatic group at the 6-position, thus, a suitable place for conjugation
with bioactives or biomolecules. In addition, these 1,2-DHPs can undergo
regioselective hydrolysis of 5-CO2Me, which was supported
by its single crystal X-ray structure (Figure S1). This selectivity can be realized by difference in nitrogen
lone pair delocalization with 3- and 5-CO2Me, thus offering
another site for conjugation via an amide linkage. Furthermore, we
have designed and synthesized a water-soluble fluorophore 1,2-DHP 1h by utilizing an aldehyde generated from triethylene glycol
monomethyl ether and N,N-diethyl
salicylaldehyde, which further offers an appropriate hydroxyl group
substituent for appending any cleavable targeting group such as phosphate
for in vitro phosphatase-sensing applications (Scheme 1).

Reagents and conditions: (a)
TFA (1 equiv), CH3CN, rt, overnight; (b) (OMe)2P(O)Cl (1.5 equiv), NaH (1.5 equiv), THF, rt, 3 h; and (c) (i) TMSBr
(10 equiv), CH2Cl2 and (ii) MeOH.

Photophysical Properties
The photophysical properties
of 1,2-DHPs 1a–1h, viz., absorption, emission,
quantum yields, and emission lifetime measurements, are provided in Table 1 and Supporting Information (Figures S2 and S3). The present design
involves a D−π–A or push–pull type system;
thus, the nature and position of the substituents on the 1,2-DHP moiety
are crucial to tune their intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) properties,
which leads to different photophysical properties. 1,2-DHPs 1a–1h exhibit maximum absorption wavelengths (λmax) between 396 and 448 nm in methanol with strong molar extinction
coefficients (5388–27 300 M–1 cm–1) and emit in the long wavelength region of 500–600
nm. 1,2-DHPs 1a and 1b exhibited similar
photophysical properties; however, replacement of the phenyl group
at the sixth position with a methyl group did not offer any change
in the properties of 1,2-DHPs 1c, 1d, and 1f when compared to the former. These results indicate that
the tuning of fluorophoric properties of these 1,2-DHPs can be made
by variations in the N-benzylideneamine moiety. Thus,
the sixth position of 1,2-DHP is an ideal position for conjugation
with other biomolecules for fluorophore tagging. To assess the role
of N-benzylideneamine in 1,2-DHP, the N-ethanimine-appended 1,2-DHP 1e was also synthesized,
and indeed, it was found poorly emissive when compared to all other
1,2-DHPs because of the reduced ICT character with the lowest molar
extinction coefficients (ε = 5388 M–1 cm–1). As expected, 1,2-DHP 1g with a strong
donating group led to a significant bathochromic shift of λmax (ca. 20 nm) and λem (ca. 50 nm) with a
higher molar extinction coefficient (ε = 23 292 M–1 cm–1).

The fluorescence quantum
yields for 1,2-DHPs 1a–1g were determined by a
relative comparison method using coumarin 15313 as a standard and were found to be in the range of 0.032–0.125
with 1,2-DHP 1g being the highest. These compounds exhibited
remarkable Stokes shift values, which can help in obtaining better
fluorescence imaging with minimum self-absorption of the fluorophore.
It is already established that for better cellular imaging, compounds
should have absorption in the visible region and high fluorescence
quantum yield. In this regard, on the basis of the observed photophysical
properties, the present design of 1,2-DHPs possesses the potential
for their application as bioprobes.

Applications
The
mitochondrial membrane has a negative
potential of −180 mV; therefore, it is typical to use cationic
dyes for imaging these organelles.14 The
push–pull system in 1,2-DHPs (Figure 1) makes the ring nitrogen of 1,2-DHP to attain
a sufficient positive charge; thus, 1,2-DHPs may have an ability to
serve as mitochondrial staining agents. Further, to assess the potential
of 1,2-DHPs for specific mitochondrial staining, 1,2-DHPs 1a–1g were studied in HeLa cells. Initially, cytotoxicity of 1,2-DHPs
was evaluated using MTT assay, and it was found that 1,2-DHPs exhibit
greater than 80% cell viability at 30 μM (Figure S4). HeLa cells were incubated with 30 μM of
1,2-DHPs for 10 min, and the excess compound was washed with Hanks’
balanced salt solution (HBSS) buffer solution. As shown in Figures 2 and S5, 1,2-DHPs were localized mostly in the cytoplasm,
specifically  stained mitochondria in HeLa cells, and no nuclear
uptake was observed. Additionally, the co-staining experiment with
MitoTracker red chloromethyl-X-rosamine (CMXRos), a commercially available
mitochondria-imaging dye, confirmed the localization of 1,2-DHPs in
the mitochondria supported by Pearson’s correlation coefficient
in the range of 0.75–0.89. Among all the 1,2-DHPs under study,
1,2-DHP 1b, 1d, and 1g were
found to exhibit high fluorescence intensity compared to others.

images of HeLa cells (a) treated with 1,2-DHPs 1b, 1d, and 1g (30 μM) for

Excitation wavelength: 440 nm (for 1,2-DHP) and 540 nm (for CMXRos)
and emission wavelength: 515 nm (for 1,2-DHP) and 645 nm (for CMXRos).
Pearson’s correlation coefficients were obtained as 0.79, 0.86,
and 0.75 for 1,2-DHPs 1b, 1d, and 1g, respectively.

As a proof of concept, to justify the importance of the new
1,2-DHP
as a fluorescent probe, we have synthesized a phosphorylated analogue 1h′ from 1,2-DHP 1h (Scheme 1). It is well-known that direct
and rapid analysis of the crude lysate for endogenous phosphatase
enzymes such as PTPs are of prime interest owing to their significant
role in insulin-signaling pathways15 and
a variety of disease states16 including
hepatocellular carcinoma17 as well as metabolic
disorders.18 PTPs are significant targets
in many diseases, and there is a growing need for direct determination
of endogenous protein phosphatase activity.19 The UV–vis absorption spectrum of the 1,2-DHP 1h′ in methanol exhibited absorption maximum at 448 nm, and the corresponding
emission spectrum shows a peak at 594 nm, whereas in aqueous buffer
medium (25 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.4), a small bathochromic shift was
observed both in absorption and emission spectra (Figure 3). The quantum yield of 1,2-DHP 1h′ in Hepes buffer medium is reduced to 0.007, which
can be rationalized by differences in the electron density involved
in conjugation with phosphate and phenoxide groups. This difference
of electronic distribution also reflected in the fluorescence lifetime
profile. 1,2-DHP 1h in Hepes buffer exhibited a fluorescence
lifetime of 1.94 ns, which is good enough for imaging experiments,20 whereas its phosphorylated analogue 1,2-DHP 1h′ did not show any decay profile because of its weak
fluorescence property (Table 1).

Hepes buffer (25 mM, pH 7.4, 0.3% DMSO) at room temperature.

To get the structural details
of 1,2-DHPs 1h and 1h′, both the
structures in their ground state were
optimized using density functional theory (DFT) with the B3LYP21 exchange correlation functional and the 6-31G**
basis set22 with a Gaussian G09 package,23 and the corresponding structures have been given
in Figure 4a,b. The
highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) of 1,2-DHP 1h have been given
in Figure 4c,d, respectively,
which shows that the HOMO of 1,2-DHP 1h is largely localized
on the diethylaniline group, whereas the LUMO is predominantly confined
on the 1,2-DHP core, thus supporting our concept of the push–pull
system. In aqueous medium, at physiological pH (Hepes buffer, pH 7.4),
the fluorescence emission properties of 1,2-DHPs 1h and 1h′ showed a distinct change. 1,2-DHP 1h with a free hydroxyl group exhibited a sixfold higher orange fluorescence
than that of 1,2-DHP 1h′ appended with a phosphate
group (Figure 4e).
The corresponding fluorescence changes were also reflected in visual
appearance of both the solutions (Figure 4e, inset).

Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, 0.3% DMSO) and corresponding visual fluorescence
change (inset).

This significant difference
in emission intensity inspired us to
explore 1,2-DHP 1h′ as a phosphatase sensor. As
it is well-known that blinking and photobleaching of the fluorophores
may cause problems for the imaging experiments,24 the photostability of 1,2-DHP 1h′ was
first tested by monitoring the fluorescence intensity as a function
of time upon continuous irradiation (λ = 445 nm) in Hepes buffer
solution (25 mM, pH 7.4, 0.3% DMSO) over a period of 20 min under
aerobic conditions and was found to be quite stable (Figure S6). Encouraged by the fluorescence features of 1,2-DHPs 1h and 1h′, we further investigated their
suitability as a probe for biological systems. The cytotoxicity of
1,2-DHPs 1h and 1h′ was determined
by MTT assay in L6 cell lines. Cells were treated with different concentrations
of 1,2-DHPs 1h and 1h′ ranging from
1 to 30 μM, and after 2 h of treatment, we found that both 1,2-DHPs 1h and 1h′ were less than 20% toxic up
to 30 μM (Figure 5a).

emission intensity for the direct assessment of PTP activity of 1,2-DHP 1h′ from cell lysate.

In our next attempt, we investigated the applicability of
1,2-DHP 1h′ as a chemosensor in the presence of
PTPs from L6
muscle cell lysate as a preliminary study. This enzymatic reaction
was performed in a 96 micro-well plate by the addition of cell lysate
(5 μL, 0.8 μg/μL) to a 100 μL aqueous solution
of 1,2-DHP 1h′ (30 μM) in Hepes buffer (25
mM, pH 7.4, 0.3% DMSO). After incubation at room temperature for 15
min, the fluorescence intensities were measured at an excitation wavelength
of 450 nm and emission at 590 nm. The increase in fluorescence intensity
with time clearly indicated cleavage of the phosphate group, which
is a result of conversion of 1,2-DHP 1h′ to 1,2-DHP 1h (Figure 5b), thus indicating the suitability of 1,2-DHP 1h′ as a fluorescent bioprobe useful for monitoring the activity of
PTPs. Further, to demonstrate the interference of 1,2-DHP 1h′ with other biologically relevant analytes, we measured the change
in fluorescence intensity of 1h′ in the presence
of various metal ions, reactive oxygen species, and under different
pH conditions. Interestingly, there was no influence of these analytes
in varying the fluorescence intensity of 1,2-DHP 1h′ (Figures S7 and S8).

Conclusions
In summary, we have designed and synthesized a new class of 1,2-DHP-based
fluorophores by a facile one-step multicomponent protocol, and their
photophysical properties were studied in detail. The results indicate
that 1,2-DHPs with an extended N-benzylideneamine
appendage have an absorption and emission maxima around 420 and 600
nm, respectively, having prominent Stokes shift. In particular, 1,2-DHPs 1g and 1h showed remarkable photophysical properties
with high fluorescence. Furthermore, 1,2-DHPs 1b, 1d, and 1g are recognized as well-suited mitochondrial
staining agents in HeLa cells. The potential of fluorophore 1,2-DHP 1h′ as a fluorescent probe in tyrosine phosphatase
activity on the cell lysate was also explored. Synthetic accessibility
and scope for conjugation warrants the utility of 1,2-DHP as a potential
fluorescent probe for biological applications.

Experimental Section
General
Experimental Methods
All the reactions were
conducted using undistilled solvents, whereas CH2Cl2 was distilled over CaH2, which was used for the
demethylation of the phosphate ester of 1,2-DHP 1h. Silica
gel 60 F254 aluminum thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates
were used to monitor the reactions with short and long wavelength
UV and visible lights to visualize the spots. Column chromatography
was performed on the silica gel 100–200 and 230–400
mesh. The Shimadzu HPLC instrument with C18-phenomenex reversed-phase
column (250 × 21.2 mm, 5 μm) was used for the purification
of 1,2-DHP 1h′ using methanol and water. 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR spectra were recorded
on a Bruker AVANCE II spectrometer at 500, 125, and 202 MHz, respectively.
Chemical shifts are given in ppm using solvent residual peaks of chloroform
(δ 7.26) and methanol (δ 3.31 ppm) as reference, and coupling
constants in hertz. High-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
analysis was recorded on a Thermo Scientific Exactive-LCMS instrument
with ions given in the m/z ratio.
Absorption spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-2450, UV–visible
spectrophotometer using a quartz cuvette with a 1 cm path length.
The fluorescence spectrum of the 1,2-DHPs were recorded on a FluoroLog-322
(Horiba) instrument, which was equipped with a 450 W Xe arc lamp as
the excitation source. The fluorescence quantum yields were determined
with the relative method, employing an optically matched solution
of coumarin 153 in MeOH as the reference (ΦR = 0.46).
The following equation was used for calculating the quantum yield  where the subscripts R and S refer to the
reference and samples, respectively. Abs, area, and n are the absorbance at the excitation wavelength, area under the
fluorescence spectrum, and refractive index of the solvent, respectively.
Fluorescence lifetimes were measured using an IBH (FluoroCube) TCSPC
system. L6 myoblast and HeLa cells were obtained from the National
Centre for Cell Sciences, Pune, India. Tris buffer (25 mM, pH 7.4,
0.3% DMSO), Hepes buffer (25 mM, pH 7.4, 0.3% DMSO) and HBSS (pH 7.4)
buffers were used for the cell culture studies. The cells were visualized
using a fluorescent microscope (Pathway 855, BD Bioscience, USA).
Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated using ImageJ
software with a JACoP plugin.

General Procedure for the
Synthesis of Hydrazone
To
a solution of hydrazine hydrate (10 equiv) in ethanol (10 mL) was added pertinent
aldehyde (1 equiv), and the resulting mixture was stirred under reflux
overnight. After complete consumption of the aldehyde, as indicated
by 1H NMR, the reaction mixture was diluted with water
and extracted with CH2Cl2. The organic layer
was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and concentrated,
and the resulting residue was used directly for the next step without
further purification.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of 1,2-DHPs 1a–1g
To a solution of dienaminodioate (0.77
mmol, 1 equiv) in
CH3CN (3 mL) were added aldehyde (1.15 mmol, 1.5 equiv),
hydrazone (1.15 mmol, 1.5 equiv), and trifluoroacetic acid (0.77 mmol,
1 equiv) at room temperature. The reaction mixture usually develops
a yellow to dark red coloration immediately, which is an indication
of the formation of 1,2-DHP. After complete consumption of dienaminodioate,
as observed on TLC, the reaction mixture was quenched with saturated
aqueous NaHCO3 and extracted with EtOAc. The organic layer
was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated,
and the resulting residue was purified by column chromatography to
afford the desired 1,2-DHP.

Cellular Studies
Cell Culture and Treatment
Rat skeletal muscle cell
lines (L6 myoblasts) and cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa) were maintained
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic–antimycotic mix
at 37 °C under 5% CO2 atmosphere.

Cell Viability
Study of 1,2-DHPs 1h and 1h′ on L6
Myoblast
MTT assay was performed to check the cytotoxicity
of the compounds. The viability of L6 myoblast was measured by means
of MTT assay. Cytotoxicities of 1,2-DHPs 1h and 1h′ (1, 5, 10, 20, and 30 μM) were standardized
based on the concentration. Briefly, cells after incubation with the
compound were washed, and MTT (0.5 g/L), dissolved in DMEM, was added
to each well for the estimation of mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity,
as described previously by Mosmann.25 After
an additional 2 h of incubation at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator,
10% of SDS in DMSO was added to each well, and the absorbance at 570
nm of solubilized MTT formazan products was measured after 45 min
using a microplate reader (BioTek-USA). Results were expressed as
percentage of cytotoxicity.  

Preparation of Cell Lysate
Cells were grown in T25
flasks and after attaining 60% confluency, cells were differentiated
in DMEM containing 2% horse serum for 5 days. Differentiated cells
were then washed three times with Hepes buffer (25 mM, pH 7.4). Cells
were scraped off from the plates using a cell scrapper and centrifuged,
and the proteins were extracted from the cell pellet using 0.15 M
KCl (4 °C for 30 min). The protein content of the lysate was
then measured using a BCA protein assay kit.

Cell Viability on the HeLa
Cell
Viability of the HeLa
cell was measured by means of MTT assay, as explained before for the
L6 myoblast. Cytotoxicities of 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 1f, 1g, 1h, and 1h′ (10, 20, 30, 50, 75, and 100
μM) were carried out based on the concentrations.

Colocalization
Study of 1,2-DHPs with MitoTracker CMXRos
Cells were grown
in a 96-well black clear bottom plates (BD Biosciences,
Franklin Lakes, BJ), and after attaining 90% confluency, the cells
were taken for the experiments. HeLa cells were incubated with MitoTracker
CMXRos (50 nM) for 20 min at 37 °C, followed by the addition
of the corresponding 1,2-DHPs (30 μM) and incubated for 10 min.
This was followed by washing the cells twice with HBSS to remove the
unbound dye. The cells were visualized under a fluorescent microscope
(Pathway 855, BD Bioscience, USA).
