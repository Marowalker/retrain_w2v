An optical resonance
method for the determination
of the strain- and stress-optical coefficients of optically transparent
polymers is presented and exemplified for monodisperse and bidisperse
molecular weight polystyrene (PS). This method employs whispering
gallery modes (WGMs) resonation inside a spheroid polymeric cavity,
suspended on an optical fiber taper waist, which, in turn, is used
for subjecting the polymeric resonator to controlled strain conditions.
The wavelength shifts of equal order transverse electric and transverse
magnetic polarization WGMs are measured, as well as their relative
birefringence versus applied strain. For monodisperse PS microspheroids
(2 and 50 kDa) the stress-optical coefficient is negative, contrary
to the results for bulk PS in the glassy state indicating different
phenyl group orientation of the PS monomer with respect to the strain
direction. In the bidisperse (2 and 50 kDa) spheroid with a symmetric
monomer composition, local structural irregularities are probably
responsible for the observed coupling between WGMs. The method possesses
metrological capabilities for probing the molecular orientation of
polymer-based resonators.

Introduction
Whispering gallery
mode (WGM) light localization into spherical
symmetry resonators is a powerful tool for the development of photonic
devices for sensing,1 lasing,2 and spectroscopic3 applications. The spectral signature of light localization by WGMs
is directly related to the optogeometrical characteristics of the
resonating cavity by means of its refractive index ellipsoid, loss,
and geometry. The light localization by WGMs through an iterative
round-trip resonation into a closed spherical cavity renders the spectral
behavior of this system impressively sensitive to spatially confined
modifications of its physical properties, as long as these modifications
overlap with the modal volume of the WGMs. Their confinement through
total internal reflection occurs along the interface of the cavity
surface with the outer environment that enhances the surface sensitivity
of the WGMs.

There are several examples wherein WGM light localization
has been
utilized for developing light localization, sensing, propulsion, and
optomechanical oscillation devices, whereas resonant cavities are
constituted from hard (glasses, crystals)4 or soft (polymer) optical materials.5 Specific stimulation schemes have been applied for modifying the
optogeometrical characteristics of WGM spheroidal cavities by means
of mechanical actuation (compression and stretching6) or application of electrical field7 for tuning the shape and/or the refractive index of the resonator.
Beyond the previous, material science can also benefit from these
superior light circulation and interrogation features for detecting,
for example, “near surface” phenomena. Specifically,
polymers exhibit interesting optical, mechanical, and rheological
properties, which classify them as key role materials in the fields
of photonics, chemistry, and biotechnology; moreover, the polymer
behavior under confinement remains an important and challenging task.8 Thus, spatially confined thermomechanical, rheological,
or chemical processes on the nanoscale9 can be potentially traced and monitored, as long as they exhibit
a direct signature into the optical properties of the WGM resonation
cavity. “Soft” WGM resonators have been presented using
polystyrene (PS),10 poly(dimethylsiloxane),11 and other polymers,12 mostly attaining modal tunability using mechanical strain or temperature
stimulus. However, all of this work is aimed at understanding the
WGM resonance manipulation utilizing external stimulations, which
is a precondition to exploit novel photonic devices applications.
On the contrary, there are few results that solely focus on the use
of soft matter WGM optical cavities for the study of the mechanical
and photoelastic properties of the polymeric material.13

The principal motivation of the present
work is to access fundamental
polymer physics questions at the microscale by tracing optical quantities
utilizing mechanically tuned WGM resonators as a primary transducing
scheme. We realize a versatile configuration of polymer microspheroidal
WGM resonators supported on a thin optical silica fiber taper (Figure 1 inset) for a straightforward
study of the photoelastic properties of the material constituting
the resonating cavity. This thin optical fiber scheme allows the controllable
application of minimal strains along the longitudinal axis of the
supporting microfiber onto the cavity, thus warranting linear material
response. Irrespective of the cavity material, the light localization
through WGMs inside the spheroid cavity exhibits inherent polarization
sensitivity.14 Yet, the field amplitudes
of the two polarization components (transverse electric (TE) and transverse
magnetic (TM) in Figure 1) are subject to strain-related walk-off paths associated with the
material local structure. The photoelasticity of polymers quantified
by the stress-optical coefficient depends on the collective segmental
and chain orientation, which, in turn, is related to the physical
state of the polymer. For the well-studied amorphous polystyrene (PS),
this coefficient is distinct in the glassy (k >
0)
and the rubber (k < 0) state above the glass transition.15 The results of the present photonic method for
glassy mono- and bidisperse PS microspheroids using low- and high-molecular-weight
PS point out that elasto-optic response can substantially deviate
from the bulk behavior when interfacial effects and internal stresses
become important. Compensation and control of polymer birefringence
is important for polymer-based photonics.16

Figure 1 Configuration
of the polystyrene (PS) resonator and whispering
gallery mode (WGM) excitation with TE and TM polarization using a
broadband superluminescent laser diode (SLD) and optical spectrum
analyzer (OSA) for signal recording. The strain is applied at both
fiber taper ends through controllable fiber elongation. TE and TM

of a 30.6 μm diameter PS spheroid, fabricated around the fiber
taper (upper inset).

Photoelasticity relies on the differential optical path of
orthogonal
polarization states of light traveling along the stress-loaded bulk
optical species. Usually, interferometric fringe shifting methods
are used for tracing phase differences and then evaluate the photoelastic
coefficient for the investigated sample.17 In the configuration of the WGM spheroid scheme of Figure 1, the small strain simultaneously
modifies the refractive index and the shape/size of the attached polymeric
WGM cavity. This combined optogeometrical perturbation results in
clear and repeatable spectral changes in the WGM signature. The spectral
notches of the WGMs localized inside the polymeric spheroid are spectrally
shifted versus the applied strain, with the spectral shifts being
different for WGMs of orthogonal polarization states (transverse electric
and transverse magnetic). By carefully exciting WGMs inside this polymeric
spheroidal cavity using another micron-sized optical fiber taper,
positioned in evanescent mode vicinity to the resonation cavity along
its meridian circumference, we can accurately monitor the spectral
shift of orthogonal polarization WGMs of the same modal order under
varying strain conditions.

Each WGM localized into a spherical
resonator is defined by the
radial (q), angular (l), and azimuthal
(m) modal numbers, as well as its polarization state
with respect to the plane vertical to the equator of the resonator.14,18 The modal index q gives a number field maxima in
the radial function of the electric field intensity, l represents the number of waves in a circular orbit, and m is the azimuthal modal index (−l < m < l), describing the
extension of the electrical field along the polar meridian of the
microspheroid resonator. In homogeneous spheres, the optical modes
are described as TE or TM, with the electric field being parallel
or perpendicular to the resonator surface, respectively (Figure 1a).

For WGMs
with q = 1, exhibiting intrinsically
higher quality Q-factor, the spectral position of
resonant wavelengths of the two modes in the equatorial area of a
spherical cavity is given by18,19 1   2  where ns is the
refractive index of the resonator, r is the radius, n = ns/ne is the refractive index contrast between the resonator and
the outer environment (ne), and . The choice of q = 1 radial
modes is also prompted by our principal interest in studying photoelastic
changes, as close to the sample surface as possible. Using the comb
of TE peaks (eq 1) with
is ns = nPS at the IR frequencies extrapolated from the dispersion relation,20 we estimate the effective r for a modal number ν (l). Because the glassy
PS spheroid can possess an inherent birefringence due to its fabrication,
the value of nTM entering eq 2 can deviate from nTE = nPS. The former can be
obtained from eq 2 using
fixed r and ν values already evaluated for
the other polarization. We note that the WGM cavities (inset to Figure 1) deviate from of
a spheroidal shape but exhibit small eccentricities (≤0.2).
However, we consider that the eccentricity affects absolute WGM wavelength
allocation, but not birefringence (eq 4 below).

Through the controlled stretching of
the optical fiber taper supporting
the PS spheroid (inset to Figure 1), a spectral shift is induced to the WGM resonances.
This can arise mainly from changes in both the refractive index and
the radius of the spheroid, assuming unaltered modal order (assumption
valid for small strains applied) and negligible eccentricity changes.6a The spectral shifts in the TE and TM WGMs emerging
from the strain application are ascribed to both resonator radius
(Δr) and refractive index (ΔnTE, TM) alterations,6a following the simple differential form 3  

where ΔλTX ≡ λTX(ε) – λTX(0) and ΔnTX ≡ nTX(ε) – nTX(0) (index X stands for either E or M) and
ε denotes the applied strain. Elimination of the radius dependence
leads to a straightforward relation 4  under the assumption that ns ≈ nTX. By employing eq 4, the differential shift
between the two polarizations was employed to calculate change in
birefringence, which was induced by applied strain. eq 4 indicates that under the condition
of small applied strains, the method followed herein is independent
of the modal order of the WGM notch investigated. Because our sample
exhibits a spherical symmetry, the strain-induced refractive index
changes per polarization component in spherical coordinates are described
by the following relationships6a 5a,b  

where Sr, Sθ, and Sϕ are the strain components
per coordinate and p1 and p2 are the strain-optical constants of polystyrene. By
combining eqs 4 and 5a,b, we get 6  

To evaluate the strain-optical coefficient k′
of an optical material, the strain-induced birefringence Δnstrain is directly correlated with the applied
strain, ε, through the simple strain-optical law 7  where (Sθθ – Srr) = Aε; A is a dimensionless multiplicative
factor emerging from the finite-element strain distribution calculations
for the strain components Srr and Sθθ (see Figure 2). Although the strain ε applied on
the two ends of the standard telecom optical fiber is precisely measured
using the experimental apparatus, its transmission to the equatorial
circumference of the polystyrene spheroid into the components Srr and Sθθ depends on the shape of the spheroid and the geometry of the tapered
optical fiber.21

Figure 2 Ratio of the Szz component
of the strain profile normalized to the externally applied strain,
ε (see color bar). In the left-hand side, the whole structure
is depicted with an aspect ratio of horizontal to vertical axis 50:1
for visualization purposes. The spheroidal particle (shown as a line
in the center of the left-hand diagram) is shown in the middle with
an aspect ratio of 1:1. In the inset, we show the linear dependence
of the strain difference Sθθ– Srr as a function
of ε.

We model the tapered
optical fiber as two cones connected through
a thin silica glass fiber, as shown in the left-hand diagram of Figure 2. The results are
based on a finite-element numerical method. The Szz component of the strain profile, as
propagated in the region of the spheroid, and the relationship of
the strain difference to the external applied strain are shown in
the middle and lower insets of Figure 2, respectively. From the linear relation between Sθθ – Srr and the strain εf applied
to the fork (Figure 2), the slope A factor is valued as 1.2 for the polystyrene
spheroids with radius of ∼15 μm. The stress-optical coefficient (22) is related
to the strain-optical coefficient, k′ = (ns3/2)(p2 – p1) (eqs 6 and 7) by 8  where v is Poisson’s
ratio and E is Young’s modulus. The sign of k′ defines the relative magnitude of the two strain-optical
constants, i.e., k′ < 0, if p2 – p1 < 0 and vice
versa. It is worth noting that the polarized and depolarized light-scattering
intensities, respectively, depend on p22 and (p2 – p1)2, rendering any information on
the sign of p2 – p1 ambiguous.23

Results and Discussion
Polystyrene, a readily vitrified amorphous polymer, resides in
the glassy state at ambient conditions. The two PS samples with low
(PS2k, Tg = 336 K) and high (PS50k, Tg = 383 K) molecular weights were selected on
the account of their different glass transition temperatures, Tg (Figure S1). Hence,
the two samples represent different quenches at room temperature that
could cause different local packing and segmental orientation. Yet,
birefringence turns out to be a very sensitive probe of orientation
fluctuations, and refractive index changes in the WGMs cavity are
sensitively manifested in differential shifts between the corresponding
TE and TM resonant modes, as already mentioned. The polarization-resolved
transmission spectra recorded with the tapered fiber in contact with
the PS spheroid (Figure 1) using PS50k are shown in Figure 3a. The sharp and distinct WGM’s spectral notches
for TE and TM polarization of different modal number l indicate a high-quality (Q-TE89 = 2.3 × 104) spheroidal cavity.

Figure 3 (a) Measured WGM’s signal normalized with the taper
transmission

the spacing (FSR = 16.31 nm) of two adjacent TE modes in the case
of PS50k. The blue shift of the resonance wavelength for the TE (b)
and TM (c) polarizations (angular number l = 89)
with increasing applied strain ε.

From the WGM spectra of the unstrained spheroid, the inherent
birefringence,
Δn0 = nTE – nTM, for the system was estimated
(eqs 1 and 2) to be about −3 × 10–4. The
attribution of modal order l for the data of Figure 3 for the PS50k sample
(as well as for the PS2k and bidisperse samples presented afterward)
was assumed for radial order q = 1. Attempts to fit
the same data using higher radial order modes (q =
2)24 led to abnormally high inherent birefringence
values (Δn0 ∼ −3.5
× 10–3), not justified by the sample preparation
process (slow annealing above Tg), as
well as by the strain birefringence measurements presented below.
The estimation of inherent birefringence is an important first result,
revealing the initial stress state of the PS microspheroid cavity
while depicting that the axial load with refractive index is larger
in the direction of the TM, i.e., normal to the spheroid. The inherent
birefringence for the PS2kDa microresonator, Δn0 = −2 × 10–4, is found
to be also negative with somewhat smaller absolute value than for
PS50k.25 Residual stresses (∼Δn0/k) in the nonequilibrium
glassy state are not unexpected,16 but
their reliable assessment allows for an additional structural characterization.
Internal stresses in glassy polymers can arise from trapped conformational
states (segmental orientation) and packing (density anisotropy) changes.26 In either case, the finite negative Δn0 in the glassy PS implies that the polarizable
phenyl side groups should be preferentially aligned normal to the
spheroid surface.15b This frozen-in polymer
conformation is more pronounced in the PS50k (high Tg) and probably reflects different thermal experience
of the surface relatively to the center of the spheroid27 with impact in the thin-film technology.28

The wavelength shift of the WGMs notches
for both polarizations
and PS2k and PS50k cavities exhibits a linear dependency upon the
strains applied (see Figure 4a); this is also related to the minimum strain load (0.04%)
applied. Strains applied to the positioning fork up to 3.85 ×
10–4 for the PS50k spheroid produced wavelength
shifts (Figure 3b,c)
of the WGM with the modal order l = 89 up to 0.28
nm for the TE polarization and 0.26 nm for the TM mode (Methods). Upon strain of the PS50k and PS2k cavities, both
TE and TM polarization WGMs exhibit excellent spectral shifting capabilities,
preserving well-defined modal shapes without perturbation of the excitation
conditions. The average slope, Δλ/δε (=2.18
and 0.7 nm/mε), emerging from both the TE and TM components
is about 3 times steeper for PS2k microspheroid (Figure 4a) while considering similar
sphere sizes/shapes and modal orders. According to eq 3, the value Δλ/λ
(=–1.4 × 10–4, for PS2k) is controlled
by the contributions of Δn and Δr, both being material characteristic. From the FEM calculations,
Δr/r = −0.87 mε,
thus an average figure for Δnstrain/ns = −0.53 mε. Alternatively,
the average Δnstrain/ns can be also estimated by adding eqs 5a,b for both polarizations while accounting for
the strain profile (see Figure 2) Srr = −0.12 mε, Sφφ = −0.87 mε, Sθθ = 1.10 mε; thus, Δnstrain/ns = −(ns2/2)(0.49p1 – 0.38p2)mε is negative
with p1 > p2. Similar calculations for the case of PS50K will lead to a positive
average Δnstrain/n. However, the different slopes for the two PS spheroids depend on
both Δr/r and Δnstrain/ns, which
are determined by the local elastic and strain-optical constants,
respectively.

Figure 4 (a) WGM resonant wavelength shift for TE and TM modes
and (b) strain-induced
optical birefringence (eq 4) as a function of applied strain ε for PS2k and PS50k with
molecular weight of 2 and 50 kDa, respectively. The spectral resolution
applied in the above measurements is 10 pm; thus, error bars are smaller
than the size of the actual symbols used.

The slope of the curves in Figure 4b, divided by the multiplicative parameter A (eq 7), yields
the strain-optical coefficient, k′. The strain-optical
coefficients evaluated for the 50 and 2 kDa samples unexpectedly assume
negative values −0.024 and −0.055. We recall that the
reported k′ for bulk PS in the glassy state
is positive.15a Using the experimental
values 0.34 for Poisson’s ratio and 3.8 GPa for the Young modulus,
as obtained from Brillouin light-scattering spectra (Figure S2), the stress-optical coefficients k (eq 8) amounts to −8.66
Br for PS50k and −19.5 Br for the PS2k spheroids. Although
the absolute value of these stress-optical coefficients exhibit a
good agreement with those reported for bulk, glassy PS samples,15a,29 their negative sign implies a chain conformation similar to that
of stretched PS melt. In the rubbery state, above Tg, it is well established that k′
< 0 due to the contribution of chain conformation and preferential
orientation of the phenyl side groups normal to the stretching direction.15b A similar sign change in k′ in the glassy state was reported for thin PS films also
attributed to the alignment of the phenyl groups of the PS chains
vertically to the axis of strain application.30 An additional notable point of our investigation is that both the
initial birefringence of the PS spheroids and the stress-optical coefficients
for the examined molecular weights are negative, contrary to the results
obtained for bulk samples. Because the present technique probes a
few microns thick shell overlapping with the modal volume of the WGM
(see Figure 1), this
disparity with the bulk could imply different segmental alignment
properties close to the surface than in the interior of the spheroids.

Apart from the sign, the value of k′ (or k) seems to also depend on the chain length, or Tg, as suggested by the larger absolute value
of k for PS50k. It could also be an inherent property
of a still poorly understood vitrification of amorphous polymers.
For example, k turns from positive to negative for
a glassy random copolymers of polystyrene with acrylonitrile15b and methylmethacrylate,31 poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile) when the
PS composition drops beyond a certain composition about 70%,31 which was again assigned to the phenyl ring
side-group conformation. For the present study, a straightforward
experiment is a bidisperse PS2k/PS50k blend with the Tg very similar to the PS2k component. A polystyrene spheroid
was accordingly prepared by mixing equal moles of PS50k and PS2k,
resulting in a symmetric polymer mixture with regard the monomer composition,
but very rich in short chains (about 25 times more PS2k chains). Due
to the same chemical monomer, the mixing is purely entropic in spite
of small differences in the density of the two constituent PS and
hence refractive indices. The bidisperse glass exhibits the same Tg (=336 K) as the PS2k as a result of the plasticization
effect due to the significant fraction of free chain ends (in PS2k);
this is verified by DSC (Figure S3). The
WGM spectra for both polarization components obtained from a 32 μm
diameter bidisperse spheroid are presented in Figure 5a.

Figure 5 (a) Measured WGM’s signal, normalized
with the taper transmission
for the WGMs with TE (black) and TM (red lines) polarization along
the spacing (FSR = 15.2 nm) of two adjacent TE and TM modes. (b) WGM
resonant wavelength shift for TE and TM mode in the case of the spheroid
with symmetric PS2k/PS50k.

A first inspection of the polarization-resolved spectra of
this
bidisperse resonator shows that the WGM resonances for both polarizations
are of broader bandwidth (Q-TE94 ∼
1.4 × 104 and Q-TM94 ∼ 0.9 ×
104) compared to those of the monodisperse samples, thus,
of lower Q-factor. This broadening behavior is more
prominent for the TM polarization modes, being perpendicular to the
strain application direction. Even for an ideally homogeneous resonator
with negligible composition fluctuations, the small refractive index
mismatch (∼1.5 × 10–2 between PS2k and
PS50k) is still high enough to induce significant phase changes in
the WGM confined light, resulting in modal broadening and/or polarization
cross-coupling. In contrast to the monodisperse spheroids (Figure 4a), the shifts λTE and λTM (Figure 5b) exhibit a nonmonotonic behavior with alternating
slopes from negative to positive birefringence, rendering a reliable
estimation of total birefringence, nTE – nTM, unlike Figure 4b, ambiguous. Nevertheless,
the average slope for both polarization modes Δλ/δε
(∼1 nm/mε) versus strain of the bidisperse spheroid (Figure 5b) rests between
those of the PS2k and PS50k, but is closer to the PS50k.

A possible
explanation of this polarization-dependent finding maybe
related to the optical inhomogeneities in the surface region (Figure 1) because the thermomechanical
properties of the bulk bidisperse symmetric PS mixture remain robust.
Both the Tg of the PS2k/PS50k (Figure S3) is almost identical to PS2k and the
sound velocities cL in the mixture and
the two components (Figure S4) are experimentally
the same. The latter conforms to the picture of the ideal mixture
with negligible composition inhomogeneities. Seemingly, this bulk
behavior does not hold near the surface, where the spatial fluctuations
of the refractive index due to the phenyl ring orientation are present.
The role of different component dynamics31,32 might play a role as the mixture enters to the glassy state through
the solvent evaporation.

Based on eq 6, the
strain-induced optical effects can impact the strain-optical constants
of glassy polystyrene that can be easily revealed by changes in the
depolarization of the inelastic light scattering (Figure S5). The origin of abnormal photoelastic behavior of
the bidisperse resonator can be manifold and related to both the material
properties of the mixture and the WGM light localization physics.
Nanodomain inhomogeneities can lead to modal crossing induced by the
excitation of transverse modes of different polar mode order m into
the polystyrene spheroid33 and cross-polarization
coupling effects,34 in addition to the
modal splitting. The application of strain into the spheroid can amplify
such type of interaction, resulting in anomalous modal birefringence,
which, in turn, is erroneously manifested as abnormal material birefringence
and photoelastic behavior. Therefore, the data obtained for the bidisperse
polystyrene spheroid are useful for investigating the sensitivity
of the method on photoelastic parameters of the material on micro-
and nanoscale. Studies are ongoing for illustrating the origin of
the photoelastic behavior of the bidisperse polystyrene WGM spheroid
resonator, whereas efforts are focused on further expanding the metrological
capabilities of the method.

Conclusions
We introduced a new
method for the precise measurement of the photoelastic
properties of glassy polymers (polystyrene) harnessing microspheroid
resonators attached on tapered optical fibers. Whispering gallery
modes (WGMs) were efficiently excited in the microresonator scheme
and showed excellent linear spectral shift with the strain applied.
The differential wavelength shift between TE and TM modes allowed
for accurate monitoring of changes in the material birefringence of
the spheroid that are associated with the strain-induced weak stresses.
The obtained strain- and stress-optical coefficients revealed a negative
photoelastic behavior for two monodisperse (2 and 50 kDa) microspheroid
resonators, contrary to the bulk polystyrene. This particular photoelastic
behavior with phenyl group oriented vertically to the axis of strain
application indicates a polystyrene scale-dependent segmental alignment.

For a symmetric bidisperse PS spheroid (50 kDa/2 kDa) possessing
the same glass transition temperature as PS2k, the method revealed
a substantially different segmental orientation than in the two monodisperse
analogues. The spectral results depicted that WGM resonating cavities,
even of modest Q-factors (∼104),
are extremely sensitive to the phase retardations induced by refractive
index fluctuations in the nanoscale. Effects such as modal broadening,
cross-coupling take place and are further amplified by the application
of strain load, transducing chain orientation effects of the intermixed
monomers to abnormal optical birefringence behavior. Notably, the
distinct segmental PS polarizability can selectively affect the polarization
component of the WGMs that are aligned with respect to polarization
anisotropy.35 The above new metrological
findings render polarization resolved WGM resonation in strain applied
polymeric cavities, a promising tool for the study of orientation
properties of macromolecules systems. Further investigations are directed
to the study of the unique elasto-optic behavior of fiber structures
made from natural silks using WGM resonation photoelastic spectroscopy.

Methods
Whispering
Gallery Mode (WGM) Excitation and Spheroid Preparation
Fiber
tapers were fabricated from a single-mode fiber SM28 with
Vytran GPX-3000 optical fiber fuser while being positioned on an adjustable
opening Invar fork for controllably applying strain on them. The strain
was applied through deforming the fork using a differential micrometric
vernier with 1 μm traveling accuracy. The applied strain ε
was directly measured through the vernier scale and also confirmed
by the attachment of an optical
fiber Bragg grating parallel to the optical fiber taper supported
on the polystyrene spheroid.

Polystyrene of two molecular weights
was used in the experiments: 50 and 2 kDa molecular weights were chosen,
due to their distinct Tg points, more
significantly for their distinct segmental and chain orientation with
respect to the phenyl group of the PS matrix that dominates their
corresponding rheological and stress-optical properties. To investigate
the stress-optical properties of a system with more complex segmental
structure, an equimolar mixture of the 50 and 2 kDa molecular weights
was also prepared. Using a syringe, a PS/toluene solution with concentration
∼0.1% for all molecular weights tested was dropped onto an
optical fiber taper (waist diameter ∼6.0 μm). Dilute
solutions below the overlap concentration are necessary to avoid fast
solidification of the drop. The solvent was removed under vacuum at T ∼ Tg + 25 (glass transition Tg(2k) = 336 K, Tg(50k) = 382 K, Tg(2k/50k) = 383 K) for
6 h and subsequently the wrapped PS drop was cooled down for 24 h,
leading to the formation of low-eccentricity spheroid cavities with
a typical diameter of 30 μm (Figure 1 inset). For comparison reasons, polystyrene
microspheroids “as-fabricated” after the first casting
and then after the controlled annealing processes described above
are provided in Figure S6.

Broadband
superluminescent laser diode (SLD) launched into a second
fiber taper with a waist diameter of 2.5 μm, placed perpendicular
to the first one in the equatorial region of the sphere, was used
to excite WGMs (Figure 1). Transmission spectra for TE and TM modes are separately recorded
with optical spectrum analyzer (OSA), utilizing polarizing ZING fiber
from Fibercore, at the fiber taper output and a spectral resolution
of 0.01 nm. For the strain measurements, both fiber taper ends were
fixed on opposite arms of a metal fork, and arms opening with micrometer
screw allowed for controllable fiber elongation. The initial tapered
fiber length was 30 mm, whereas the maximum length increase used in
experiment was 11.55 μm, corresponding to a strain ε of
0.385 × 10–3 or 0.385 mε. The size of
the polymer spheroid was measured using an optical stereoscope with
a resolution limit of ∼1 μm. The optical fiber taper
was placed in contact with the spheroid, and WGM excitation was achieved
under different strain conditions. For excluding creeping effects
between the supporting optical fiber taper and the PS spheroid, spectral
measurements were repeated after strain relaxation, where no spectral
hysteresis of the WGMs was observed.

Brillouin Light Scattering
(BLS)
Polarized (VV) and
depolarized (VH) BLS spectra were recorded by a tandem six-pass Fabry–Perot
interferometer at different phonon wavelengths. The longitudinal cL and transverse cT sound velocities (in the case of solids) are obtained from the polarized
(VV) and depolarized (VH) BLS spectra, respectively. V(V, h) stands
for laser polarization vertically, V, and scattered light being either
vertically (v) or horizontally (h) relatively to the scattered plane
(the scattered plane is defined by the wave vectors of the laser and
the scattered light). BLS measures the sound velocity for the longitudinal
and transverse phonons through the inelastic light scattering by the
propagation of thermally excited phonon in the material. In homogeneous
materials with linear acoustic behavior, the frequency, f = cq/(2π), is proportional to the magnitude
of the phonon wave vector, q, defined by the scattering
geometry. The longitudinal cL and transverse cT sound velocity (in the case of solids) are
obtained from the polarized (VV) and depolarized (VH) BLS spectra,
respectively (Figure S2). V(V, h) stands
for laser polarization vertically, V, and scattered light being either
vertically (v) or horizontally (h) relatively to the scattered plane
(the scattered plane is defined by the wave vectors of the laser and
the scattered light). The access to both longitudinal M = ρcL2 and shear G = ρcT2 moduli
with cL = (2370 ± 20) m/s and cT = (1170 ± 10) m/s allows the estimation
of Young’s modulus, E = 2G(1 + ν), where ρ (=1.04 g/cm3 for PS) is the density and ν = (cL2 – 2cT2)/[2(cL2 –
2cT2)] = 0.34, is Poisson’s
ratio. Hence, G = 1.4 GPa and E =
3.8 GPa.
