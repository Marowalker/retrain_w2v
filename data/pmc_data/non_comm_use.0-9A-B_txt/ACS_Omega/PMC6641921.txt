Two diamines, bis[4-(4-(4-aminophenoxy)-2-tert-butylphenoxy)phenyl] sulfone (PSNH2) and
4,4′-bis[4-(4-aminophenoxy)-2-tert-butylphenoxy)perfluorobiphenyl
(PFNH2),
were prepared from 3-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole
using a four-step procedure, including two nucleophilic substitutions,
demethylation, and catalytic reduction. On the basis of PSNH2 and PFNH2, two series of low dielectric polyetherimides
(PEIs) were prepared. Both series of PEIs exhibit moderate-to-high
thermal properties, including a glass transition temperature (Tg) > 259 °C (depending on the rigidity
of dianhydride), a 5 wt % decomposition temperature (Td5%) > 496 °C, and a coefficient of thermal expansion
< 66 ppm/°C. Because of the hydrophobic tert-butyl phenylene oxide structure, both series of PEIs show excellent
dielectric properties, with a dielectric constant as low as 2.4–2.7.
The structure–property relationship of both series of PEIs
is discussed in this work.

Introduction
Because
of the strong intermolecular interactions and chain rigidity,
polyimides exhibit high-temperature stability, oxidative properties,
hydrolytic stability, and mechanical properties. These characteristics
make them widely applicable in various fields including interlayer
dielectrics in flexible printed circuit board,1 optics,2 and electronics.3,4 For high-speed calculation and high-frequency communication, materials
with low dielectric characteristics are desired because the propagation
velocity of the signal is inversely proportional to the square of
the dielectric constant of the interlayer dielectric. At present,
the commercially available polyimide Kapton is widely used for interlayer
dielectrics in flexible printed circuit boards. However, the dielectric
constant of Kapton is around 3.2–3.4, which does not meet the
requirement for the next generation of interlayer dielectrics. Therefore,
research studies on low dielectric polyimides are significant.5−8

Four major strategies have been applied to prepare polyimides
with
low dielectric constant. The first one is to incorporate microporosity
because the dielectric constant of air is as low as 1.9−11 However, the difficulty of having good control of the pore size
and distribution and the reduced mechanical strength might hinder
the application of this technique. The second approach incorporates
bulky pendants that will increase the free volume.12−15 For example, Li et al. prepared
polyimides derived from 2′,7′-bis(4-aminophenoxy)-spiro(fluorene-9,9′-xanthene).12 The bulky spirofluorene xanthene structure,
which loosens the polymer packing, led to polyetherimide (PEI) with
a dielectric constant of 2.65 for (hexafluoroisopropylidene)bis(phthalic
anhydride) (6FDA)-based PEI. Chern and Tsai
prepared low dielectric polyimides from a di-tert-butyl-containing diamine, 2,4-bis(4-aminophenoxy)-2,6-di-tert-butylbenzene.13 The resulting
polyimides exhibited organosolubility and a low dielectric constant
(i.e., 2.74–2.92). The third approach incorporates an aliphatic
structure into polyimides.16 For example,
Ward et al. prepared aliphatic polyimides and found that the dielectric
constant decreased from 2.76 for BPADA/ODA PEI to 2.55 for BPADA/DCHM
PEI, in which BPADA is 4,4′-bisphenol A dianhydride, ODA is
4,4′-oxydianiline, and DCHM is an aliphatic diamine, 4,4′-diaminodicyclohexylmethane.
However, compared with BPADA/ODA PEI, a 70 °C decrease in degradation
temperature was found for BPADA/DCHM PEI.16 The fourth approach incorporates a fluorine element because of the
low polarizability of the C–F bond.17−19 Hougham et
al. prepared a series of polyimides based on 6FDA and various fluorinated
diamines. The resulting fluorinated polyimides exhibit a low dielectric
constant of 2.5–2.8.17 Li et al.
prepared PEIs with bulky trifluoromethyl and a chloride pendant group
and found that the refractive index, which is related to the dielectric
constant according to Maxwell’s relationship, decreases with
the fluoro content.18

Poly(2,6-dimethyl
phenylene oxide) (PPO), with hydrophobic dimethyl
and low polar phenylene oxide structure, possesses a low dielectric
constant of 2.5. Oligo PPOs with allyl, methyl methacrylate, and styrene
curable linkage have been widely used for printed circuit boards.20−22 Taking advantage of the low dielectric characteristic of PPO, Ueda
et al. prepared fluorinated polyimides containing phenylene oxide
and a perfluorobiphenyl structure.23 They
concluded that the incorporation of the perfluorobiphenyl unit accompanied
with a phenylene ether unit effectively decreases the dielectric constant
while maintaining the thermal stability of polyimides. In this work,
combining the structural advantage of PPO and the second and fourth
approaches, two tert-butyl phenylene oxide-containing
diamines, bis[4-(4-(4-aminophenoxy)-2-tert-butylphenoxy)phenyl]
sulfone (PSNH2) and 4,4′-bis[4-(4-aminophenoxy)-2-tert-butylphenoxy]perfluorobiphenyl (PFNH2),
were prepared. On the basis of PSNH2 and PFNH2, two series of low dielectric PEIs were prepared. The structure–property
relationship of the PEIs was discussed.

Results and Discussion
Monomer
Synthesis
Diamines, PSNH2 and PFNH2, were synthesized from 3-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole
through a four-step procedure (Scheme 1). The first step is the nucleophilic substitution
of 3-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole with bis(4-fluorophenyl)sulfone
and decafluorobiphenyl, forming dimethoxy bis[4-(4-methoxyl-2-tert-butylphenoxy)phenyl] sulfone (PSOCH3) and
4,4′-bis[4-(4-methoxyl-2-tert-butylphenoxy)perfluorobiphenyl]
(PFOCH3), respectively. The second step is the demethylation
of PSOCH3 and PFOCH3, leading to bisphenol bis[4-(4-hydroxyl-2-tert-butylphenoxy)phenyl] sulfone (PSOH) and 4,4′-bis[4-(4-hydroxyl-2-tert-butylphenoxy)]perfluorobiphenyl (PFOH), respectively.
Diamines were prepared through the nucleophilic substitution of bisphenol
with 4-fluoro-nitrobenzene, followed by catalytic reduction. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were applied to identify
the structure of dimethoxy (Figures S1 and S2), bisphenol (Figures S3 and S4), and
dinitro (Figures S5 and S6). Figure S7 shows the 1H NMR spectra
of (a) PSNH2 and (b) PFNH2. An amino peak was
clearly observed at 4.9 ppm in both spectra. 1H–1H correlation spectroscopic spectrum confirms the splitting
patterns of both diamines (Figure S8).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Diamines, PSNH2 and PFNH2
Synthesis of PEIs
The PEIs were prepared by thermal
imidization of poly(amic acid) (PAA) that was prepared by low-temperature
polymerization of three commercially available dianhydrides with the
two diamines. As shown in Table S1, gelation
occurred for the PFNH2-based PAA at a normal solid content
(15–20 wt %). A homogeneous solution can only be obtained at
5 wt % for pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA)/PFNH2 PAA. By
contrast, a homogeneous solution can be obtained at 20 wt % for all
PSNH2-based PAA. Therefore, because of the poor solubility
of PFNH2-based PAA, the solubility of PFNH2-based
PEIs is expected to be poor and will be discussed later. The molecular
weight of PEIs is described in Table S2. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) ranges from 8.2 to 9.2 × 104 g/mol. The weight-average
molecular weight (Mw) of PSNH2-based PEI ranges from 22.6 to 23.4 × 104 g/mol.
However, PFNH2-based PEI is insoluble in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) for the gel permeation chromatography
(GPC) measurement (see Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Synthesis of PSNH2-Based and PFNH2-Based PEIs
Solubility of PEIs
Table S3 lists the organosolubility data of PEIs. PSNH2-based
PEIs display the solubility in NMP, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and
m-cresol upon heating. 6FDA/PSNH2 is even soluble in dichloromethane,
chloroform, and tetrahydrofuran (THF) without heating. The conformation
of PSNH2-based and PFNH2-based PEIs might be
explained by the single-crystal diffractogram of PSOCH3 (Figure 1a, the detailed
diffraction data of PSOCH3 are listed in Tables S4–S8. Note that the single-crystal diffractogram
of PSNH2 is not available) and PFOCH3 (Figure 1b, the detailed diffraction
data of PFOCH3 are listed in Tables S9–S13. Note that the single-crystal diffractogram of
PFNH2 is not available). As shown in Figure 1, PSOCH3 displays a non-coplanar
conformation of the diphenyl sulfone (ph–SO2–ph)
linkage that retards the stacking of PEI chains. This could be responsible
for the solubility of PSNH2-based PEIs. By contrast, PFOCH3 exhibits a more coplanar conformation that leads to close
stacking of polymer chains. This explains the insolubility of PFNH2-based PEIs.

Figure 1 Single-crystal diffractogram of (a) PSOCH3 and
(b) PFOCH3.

XRD of PEIs
Figure S9 shows
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for both series of PEIs. According
to Bragg’s law, the d-spacing values are 5.40,
5.31, and 5.67 Å for PMDA/PSNH2, 4,4′-oxydiphthalic
anhydride (ODPA)/PSNH2, and 6FDA/PSNH2, respectively,
and are 4.75, 4.96, and 5.23 Å for PMDA/PFNH2, ODPA/PFNH2, and 6FDA/PFNH2 PEIs, respectively. With the same
dianhydride, PSNH2-based PEIs show larger d-spacings than PFNH2-based PEIs. The non-coplanar, bend
conformation of diphenyl sulfone causes PSNH2-based PEIs
to exhibit larger d-spacings than PFNH2-based PEIs. The XRD d-spacing data are consistent
with the solubility data.

Film Quality and Thermal Properties
Figure S10 shows images of both series
of PEIs. All of the
films are transparent and foldable. Because they are foldable for
thermal mechanical analysis, dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA) and
thermomechanical analyzer (TMA) are used to measure the thermal properties. Figure 2a shows the DMA thermograms
of the synthesized PEIs. Depending on the rigidity of dianhydride,
the Tg values of the PEIs range from 258
to 274 °C for PSNH2-based PEIs and from 272 to 291
°C for PFNH2-based PEIs (Table 1). The coplanar structure of perfluorophenyl,
which explains the poor solubility of PFNH2-based PEIs,
also explains the higher Tg values of
PFNH2-based PEIs than that of PSNH2-based PEIs.
For the same diamine, the order of Tg is
PMDA-based > 6FDA-based > ODPA-based PEIs. The trend is consistent
with the rigidity of the dianhydride moiety. Figure 2b shows the TMA thermograms of the synthesized
PEIs. The Tg values are in the range of
237–265 °C for PSNH2-based PEIs and 244–265
°C for PFNH2-based PEIs (Table 1). The trend of the structure–Tg relationship observed in the TMA measurement
is the same as that of the DMA measurement. The coefficients of thermal
expansion (CTE) are in the range of 60–66 ppm/°C, demonstrating
moderate dimensional stability. The tert-butyl, which
hinders the packing of PEIs, may explain the CTE value that is higher
than common polyimides. The thermal stability of the PEIs was evaluated
by TGA in an N2 atmosphere (Figure S11). The 5% decomposition temperatures ranged from 496 to
515 °C for PSNH2-based PEIs and from 508 to 530 °C
for PFNH2-based PEIs. The char yields at 800 °C are
in the range of 38–50% for PSNH2-based PEIs and
53–57% for PFNH2-based PEIs. Both series of PEIs
show moderate-to-high thermal stability.

PEIs.

Contact Angle
Figure 3 describes
the advancing contact angle of water of
the synthesized PEIs. The contact angles are 83.11, 81.11, and 85.30°
for PSNH2-based PEIs and 87.89, 84.79, and 89.61°
for PFNH2-based PEIs. Because of the hydrophobic perfluorobiphenyl
moiety, PFNH2-based PEIs display a higher contact angle.
In addition, all their values are much higher than that of the ODPA/OPA
polyimide (53°), suggesting a hydrophobic characteristic for
the synthesized PEIs. We think that the hydrophobic tert-butyl phenylene oxide structure increases the hydrophobicity of
the synthesized PEIs, and a low dielectric constant is expected (will
be discussed later).

Figure 3 Contact angle of the synthesized PEIs.

Dielectric Properties
Hougham et
al. proposed three
strategies to prepare polyimides with low dielectric properties: (i)
incorporating diamine and dianhydride which minimizes polarizability,
(ii) incorporating diamine and dianhydride which imparts a high degree
of free volume, and (iii) changing the hydrophobicity which eliminates
water.17 The dielectric constant (Dk) and dielectric loss tangent (Df) of both series of PEIs are listed in Table 2. The Dk value is 2.6–2.7 for PSNH2-based PEI and
is 2.4 for PFNH2-based PEI. The Df value is 0.015–0.016 for PSNH2-based PEI
and is 0.009–0.010 for PFNH2-based PEI. The Dk value is much lower than that of Kapton (PMDA/ODA,
around 3.2–3.4),8 showing the low
dielectric characteristic of the synthesized PEIs. The Dk value is also lower than that (around 2.68) of ODPA-based
PEIs with 2,6-dimethylphenylene oxide and perfluorobiphenyl units.23 It is known that PPO-based thermoset, such as
SA9000 (oligo PPO with the methacrylate chain end)24 and OPE-2st (oligo PPO with the styrene chain end),25 exhibits very good dielectric characteristic.
Therefore, the bulky tert-butyl group,26−28 the non-coplanar conformation of diphenyl sulfone (ph–SO2–ph), and phenylene oxide24,25 explain the low dielectric characteristics of PSNH2-based
PEIs, whereas the bulky tert-butyl group, the symmetric
perfluorobiphenyl,23 and phenylene oxide
explain the low dielectric characteristics of PSNH2-based
PEIs.

Conclusions
We have successfully prepared two diamines,
PSNH2 and
PFNH2, with tert-butyl and phenylene oxide
structures. The structure of the diamines was successfully analyzed
by IR, NMR, and mass spectra. Two series of PEIs, PSNH2-based and PFNH2-based PEIs, were successfully prepared
based on the condensation of the two diamines with three commercially
available dianhydrides. PSNH2-based PEIs are soluble in
most solvents, whereas PFNH2-based PEIs are insoluble in
the same solvent. The single-crystal structure of PSOCH3 shows a non-coplanar conformation of the diphenyl sulfone (ph–SO2–ph) linkage, whereas the single-crystal structure
of PFOCH3 exhibits a more coplanar conformation that leads
to close stacking of polymer chains. X-ray diffraction shows that
PSNH2-based PEIs exhibit larger d-spacings
than PFNH2-based PEIs. Both results explain the result
of solubility. All the PEI films are transparent and foldable. DMA
thermograms show that the Tg values of
the PEIs range from 258 to 274 °C for PSNH2-based
PEIs and from 272 to 291 °C for PFNH2-based PEIs.
Contact angle data show hydrophobic characteristics for the synthesized
PEIs. Dielectric data show a very low dielectric constant for both
PEIs. The bulky tert-butyl group, the non-coplanar
conformation of diphenyl sulfone (ph–SO2–ph),
and phenylene oxide explain the low dielectric characteristics of
PSNH2-based PEIs, whereas the bulky tert-butyl group, the symmetric perfluorobiphenyl, and phenylene oxide
explain the low dielectric characteristics of PSNH2-based
PEIs.

hydrogen. The pressure of the reactor was maintained at about 140
psi under the hydrogen atmosphere for 24 h. Then, the obtained mixture
was filtered to remove Pd/C, and the filtrate was poured into distilled

Preparation of Polyimide
Films
The synthesized diamines,
PSNH2 and PFNH2, were reacted with three commercial
aromatic dianhydrides, PMDA, ODPA, and 6FDA. A typical synthetic procedure
for PEI PMDA/PSNH2 is shown in the following: diamine PSNH2 0.5 g (0.686 mmol) and 2.60 mL of dry DMAc (20 wt %) were
added into a 100 mL round-bottom glass flask equipped with a condenser
and a magnetic stirrer. The system was purged with nitrogen,
and the solution was stirred for an hour. Dianhydride PMDA 0.15 g
(0.686 mmol) was added into the solution and stirred for 12 h to form
PAA. PAA was cast on a glass substrate and dried at 60 °C (12
h), 100 °C (1 h), 200 °C (1 h), and 300 °C (1 h). The
other PEIs were prepared in a similar process. The detailed conditions
are described in Table S1.
