The
binding characteristics and superimposed antioxidant properties
of caffeine combined with copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD) were
studied. The superimposed antioxidant activity of caffeine with SOD
was investigated by detecting the concentration of malondialdehyde
(MDA) present in cells, which was induced by hyperthermia and heavy
metal exposure. The interactions between the SOD enzyme and caffeine
were researched by ultraviolet spectrum, fluorescence spectrum, and
molecular computation. The relative amounts of MDA contents of caffeine
(0.1 mmol/L), SOD (0.1 mg/L), and caffeine (0.1 mmol/L) and SOD (0.1
mg/L) to water in cells were 0.70, 0.72, and 0.54, respectively, indicating
that the antioxidant properties of caffeine combined with SOD may
be superimposed. The fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular computation
results show that the mixture of caffeine and SOD can result in the
formation of a 1:1 complex through hydrogen bond and van der Waals
forces spontaneously. The binding constant (Ka) of caffeine with SOD at five different temperatures are
4.41 × 104, 3.30 × 104, 2.29 ×
104, 1.71 × 104, and 1.17 × 104 L/mol. The changes of Gibbs-free energy (ΔG) are −26.50, −26.21, −25.71, −25.12,
and −24.29 KJ/mol and the ΔG of molecular
docking calculation is −26.95 KJ/mol. The experimental results
are in accordance with the results of theoretical calculations. The
combination of caffeine with SOD can change the conformation and microenvironment
of SOD but does not change the activity of SOD. In addition, the combination
can superimpose the antioxidant activity of caffeine and SOD.

1 Introduction
Caffeine, which is a type
of methyl xanthine alkaloid, can improve
mood and combat fatigue, and it has been widely used in drugs, foods,
and cosmetics.1 Caffeine can act directly
on the human cerebral cortex, and it has many other effects on human
physiology, such as exciting the central nervous system and vasomotor
center,2 improving cognitive ability,3,4 and boosting circulation.5 Caffeine also
affects the digestive, respiratory, and endocrine systems. Because
caffeine has a long half-life and less-toxic side effects compared
to theophylline and aminophylline,6 it
is widely used. Therefore, the number of studies on caffeine have
gradually increased over time.

Antioxidation is an important
physiological function of caffeine.7,8 Many studies
have shown that caffeine can scavenge free radicals9−14 and increase the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in vivo.15,16 Caffeine can also stop the cross-linking of DNA and reduce oxidative
stress.17,18 Many diseases are closely related to oxidative
stress, antioxidation, and the metabolism of free radicals. Reactive
oxygen species (ROS) are the most important free radicals that exist
in organisms. ROS, including superoxide anion free radicals (O-2•), hydroxyl free radicals (•OH),19 hydrogen peroxide free radicals (HOO•), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), lipid peroxide
(LPO), and so on, are substances produced by organisms under normal
and abnormal conditions. Oxygen free radicals are closely related
to many diseases, so antioxidation systems, such as glutathione peroxidise,
SOD, and catalase have great effects on organisms. These oxidation
systems are responsible for scavenging free radicals so that the structure
and function of the cell membrane is protected.

SOD is the only
enzyme that utilizes superoxide anion free radicals
as a substrate;20,21 SOD plays an important role in
the metabolism of ROS and can stop the damage caused by superoxide
anion free radical. Caffeine is a good scavenger of •OH and •OCH3 but not superoxide anion
free radical.12 However, Petrucci and Rita
reported that caffeine might not be considered as an antioxidant.13 However, the combination of caffeine with SOD
may change this result. Many experiments have shown that caffeine
can enhance the oxidative activity of SOD and reduce oxidative stress
in vivo.15,16,22−24 However, the interaction between caffeine and SOD at the molecular
level has not been studied. The interactions between small molecule
drugs and proteins have been one of the most important research fields
in molecular biology.25−32

In this paper, the antioxidant activities of caffeine, SOD,
and
caffeine combined with SOD were studied by pyrogallol autoxidation,
and the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) present in cells was
detected. The interaction between caffeine and SOD was investigated
with ultraviolet spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and molecular
computation. The binding mechanism, binding constants, and binding
sites were obtained. Molecular simulation was used to simulate the
bonding between caffeine and SOD. Additionally, the effect of caffeine
on the conformation of SOD was examined by fluorescence spectroscopy
and molecular simulation. Furthermore, the effect of caffeine on the
activity of SOD was also investigated. This work may provide useful
information regarding the pharmacology of caffeine.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Analysis of MDA Levels
in Cell
MDA,
which is the end-product of membrane lipid peroxidation, can be used
as an indicator of membrane lipid peroxidation, and the concentration
of MDA can indicate the degree of cell peroxidation.36 The concentration of MDA in cells changes because of hyperthermia
and heavy metal exposure. To study the antioxidant properties of caffeine,
the change in the MDA concentration in cells resulting from heating
or heavy metal exposure was measured. The effects of different kinds
of heavy metal ions (Ni2+, Co2+, Fe3+, Cu2+, Hg2+) on the concentration of MDA in
cells were studied. Under the same conditions, Hg2+ causes
the most serious damage to cells. Therefore, Hg2+ was selected
to explore the antioxidant activity of MDA under the conditions caused
by heavy metals. Because different batches of spinach leaves have
different levels of MDA, the relative value is calculated using water
as a reference. Figure 1 shows the relative amount of MDA after exposure to different concentrations
of caffeine for 1 h.

Figure 1 Relative amount of MDA measured in the cells after 1 h
of exposure
to various concentrations of caffeine (0, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.10,
and 0.15 mmol/L). (A) Hyperthermia, (B) HgCl2 (0.184 mmol/L)
(our experimental results show that, under the same conditions, Hg2+ more seriously damages cells than Ni2+, Co2+, Fe2+, and Cu2+).

Over a certain range, the relative amount of MDA decreased with
increasing concentrations of caffeine. The best response of caffeine
on MDA occurs at 0.08 mM, but when the concentration of caffeine is
0.1 mM, the concentrations of MDA tend to stabilize.

The amounts
of MDA resulting from hyperthermia and heavy metal
exposure in the presence of caffeine for different mixing times were
examined, as shown in Figure 2. It can be seen from Figure 2A that the concentration of MDA decreased with increasing
exposure times and reached the lowest concentration after 2 h. The
amount of MDA of H2O changed little (1, 1.02, 1.05, 1.04,
0.95, 0.94) relative to amount of MDA on adding caffeine (1, 0.86,
0.76, 0.68, 0.64, 0.76). As shown by Figure 2B, as the mixing time increased, the antioxidative
effect of caffeine was obviously enhanced. The results show that caffeine
can inhibit the production of free radicals and has a high antioxidant
activity.

Figure 2 Relative amount of MDA measured in the cell with caffeine (0.10
mmol/L) for different lengths of time (0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and
3.0 h). (A) Hyperthermia, (B) HgCl2 (0.184 mmol/L).

SOD is an antioxidant enzyme that scavenges and
removes free radicals
in organisms and protects organisms from damage caused by superoxide
anion free radicals. Caffeine can inhibit hydroxyl and alkyl radicals.
Therefore, SOD and caffeine were combined to determine the antioxidation
effect, and the results are shown in Figure 3. The relative amount of MDA contents of
caffeine, SOD, caffeine and SOD to water in cells were 0.70, 0.72,
0.54, respectively; 0.54 is much less than 0.70 or 0.72, and close
to 0.504 (0.7 × 0.72), so the complexations of SOD with caffeine
can maintain their respective antioxidant activity. Determining whether
caffeine and SOD can form a complex and whether the antioxidative
activity of the complex can be superimposed is important. Next, the
effect of caffeine on the antioxidant activity of SOD and the interaction
between caffeine and SOD were investigated.

Figure 3 Relative amounts of MDA
present in cells exposed to HgCl2 (0.18 mmol/L), H2O, HgCl2 (0.18 mmol/L), and
caffeine (0.1 mmol/L), caffeine (0.1 mmol/L), SOD (0.1 mg/L), caffeine
(0.1 mmol/L), and SOD (0.1 mg/L).

2.2 Effect of Caffeine on the Activity of Cu/Zn-SOD
The determination methods of SOD activity can be divided into direct
and indirect methods. The direct determination method such as pulse
radiolysis and stopped flow technique have high accuracy, but they
need complex equipment and tedious experimental methods. Pyrogallol
assay37 is an indirect method. It is simple
and sensitive, and has been widely used. Since the establishment of
the methodology in 1974, it has been cited more than 5000 times.38 Pyrogallol autoxidation was used to detect the
antioxidant activity of SOD when it was mixed with different concentrations
of caffeine. Figure 4a,b shows the inhibition of superoxide anion free radicals by caffeine
and the caffeine and SOD mixture, respectively. The concentration
of superoxide anions is the key to pyrogallol autoxidation. The changes
shown in Figure 4 are
not very obvious and show that caffeine had no significant effect
on pyrogallol autooxidation, which indicates that caffeine could not
scavenge the O-2• free radicals. In addition, the
result is consistent with the literature report. Figure 4b also shows that the antioxidant
effect of SOD mixed with caffeine does not change. The results show
that the complexation of caffeine with SOD has no influence on the
activity of SOD.

of caffeine and (b)
the antioxidant effect of the caffeine and SOD mixture.

2.3 Ultraviolet Absorption Spectroscopic Studies
The ultraviolet absorption spectra of proteins vary with the chromophore
environment of proteins. The complexation of a protein with a small
molecule will cause either a red shift or a blue shift in the absorption
spectrum.32,39,40 A red shift
at 223 nm is caused by a π–n* transition of the peptide
bond, which is related to the α-helix of protein, and a blue
shift is caused by a π–π* transition. The UV absorption
in the 250–280 nm range for the SOD solution occurs because
of the absorption by tryptophan, phenylalanine, and tyrosine residues. Figure 5 shows the ultraviolet
absorption spectra of the SOD solution with and without caffeine at
303 K. The absorption peak at 223 nm decreased after the red shift,
whereas the peak at 275 nm increased. The results show that caffeine
and SOD can form a complex, and the complexation can change the α-helix
of protein.

Figure 5 Ultraviolet absorption spectra of SOD solutions with and without
caffeine (pH = 8.2, T = 303 K). c(SOD) = 2.4 × 10–3 g L–1; c(caffeine)/(10–5 mol L–1), 1–7: 0, 0.6, 1.1, 2.3, 3.4, 4.6, and 5.7,
respectively.

2.4 Effect
of Caffeine on the Fluorescence of
Cu/Zn-SOD
2.4.1 Analysis of the Influence of Different Concentrations
on Fluorescence Spectra
Fluorescence spectroscopy is an important
method used to study the interaction between proteins and small molecules.41,42 The fluorescence of proteins mainly derives from tryptophan and
tyrosine residues.43,44 The fluorescence lifetime of
SOD is related to its structure and microenvironment. Changes in the
fluorescence lifetime of SOD mixed with different concentrations of
caffeine at different temperatures are shown in Figure 6. The fluorescence lifetime of SOD increased
with an increase in the concentration of caffeine. The results show
that the interaction between caffeine and SOD can reduce the nonradiative
transition and improve the efficiency of energy transfer.45

Figure 6 Fluorescence lifetime of Cu/Zn-SOD solutions with and
without caffeine
(pH = 8.2, T = 298 K). c(SOD) =
2.4 × 10–3 g L–1; c(caffeine)/(10–5 mol L–1), 1–7: 0, 2.8, 5.7, 8.6, 11.4, and 14.2, respectively.

At an excitation wavelength of 275 nm, a maximum
emission peak
was observed at 309 nm for the SOD solution.44 The maximum emission wavelength of most proteins is 280 nm. The
maximum excitation wavelength of SOD is 275 nm, which is because compared
with other proteins, there are fewer tryptophan residues in SOD. The
influence of different caffeine concentrations on the fluorescence
spectra of the SOD solution is shown in Figure 7. As the concentration of caffeine increased,
the fluorescence intensity of the SOD solution decreased, and a shift
was not observed. This is characteristic of endogenous fluorescence
quenching.

Figure 7 Fluorescence spectra of SOD solutions with various concentrations
of caffeine at 303 K (pH = 8.2, λex = 275 nm). c(SOD) = 1.12 × 10–4 g L–1; c(caffeine)/(10–5 mol L–1), 1–7: 0, 0.8, 1.7, 2.6, 3.4, 4.3, and 5.1,
respectively.

2.4.2 Mechanism
of SOD Fluorescence Quenching
by Caffeine
Dynamic quenching and static quenching are two
main theories used to explain the mechanism of fluorescence quenching.
The changes of fluorescence quenching parameters between proteins
and small molecules at different temperatures can be used to distinguish
between dynamic quenching and static quenching.46 Dynamic quenching is a process with shortened excited state
lifetimes, which should follow the Stern–Volmer equation.32,39 1  F0—the
steady-state fluorescence intensities without quencher; F—the steady-state fluorescence intensities with quencher; Ksv—the Stern–Volmer quenching
constant; [Q]—the concentration of the quencher; if a protein
forms a complex with small molecules through noncovalent bonds, static
quenching will occur. The binding constant KA (L/mol) and the binding sites n can be calculated from eq 2. 2  

When the
binding constants of caffeine
and SOD at different temperatures are calculated, the thermodynamic
parameters at different temperatures can be calculated by thermodynamic
formulae.

Figure 8 shows the
Stern–Volmer plot of SOD by caffeine at different temperatures.
The slope decreased as the temperature increased. The results indicate
that fluorescence quenching of SOD by caffeine decreased as the temperature
increased, which is consistent with static quenching. Because noncovalent
bonds are sensitive to temperature, the increase of the temperature
is not conducive to the complex stability.

Figure 8 Stern–Volmer plots
for the quenching of SOD by caffeine
at 298, 303, 308, 310, and 312 K (pH = 8.2).

Figure 9 shows the
double reversal diagram of the fluorescence quenching of SOD with
caffeine at different concentrations and different temperatures. According
to the slope and intercept of the standard equation, the binding sites
and the binding constant for the complex of SOD and caffeine were
obtained, as shown in Table 1. It can be seen from Figure 9 and Table 1 that, when the temperature is either 298, 303, 308, 310,
or 312 K, the linear correlation of 1/(F0 – F) to 1/[Q] is good, and the correlation
coefficient R is greater than 0.99. The SOD and caffeine
binding sites are close to 1, which indicates that SOD and caffeine
form complexes at stoichiometric ratios of 1:1 and also that the temperature
has little effect on the binding ratio between SOD and caffeine. These
results also show that the fluorescence quenching of caffeine with
SOD is static.

caffeine at 298, 303, 308, 310, and 312 K (pH = 8.2).

2.4.3 Analysis of Binding Modes
and Thermodynamic
Parameters
Hydrophobic effect, hydrogen bond, van der Waals
force, and electrostatic force are the main forces existing between
small molecules and macromolecules.46 Ross
reported that, when the change in the enthalpy and entropy of a system
is greater than zero (ΔH > 0 and ΔS > 0), the main force between proteins and small molecules
forming a complex is caused by hydrophobic effects; when ΔH < 0 and ΔS < 0, hydrogen
bonds and van der Waals forces are the main forces that cause the
formation of small molecule and protein complexes; when ΔH < 0 and ΔS > 0, electrostatic
forces are the main force promoting the formation of a complex.47,48 Whereas the binding constants of SOD and caffeine at different temperatures
were obtained, the thermodynamic parameters under the corresponding
temperature conditions can be obtained. The results are shown in Table 1. 3   4   5   6  

As shown in Table 1, the change in the
enthalpy and entropy
of the system is less than zero. Therefore, hydrogen bond and van
der Waals force play the main role in the interaction between SOD
and caffeine. In addition, ΔG < 0, which
indicates that the complexation of caffeine and SOD is spontaneous.
These results show that SOD complexes easily with caffeine, and high
temperatures are not conducive to the formation of the caffeine–SOD
complex.

2.5 Computational Modeling
Studies
A
caffeine molecule was positioned in the binding site, as shown in Figure 10, and the binding
site was located at the largest cavity in the protein structure. Because
of their remote distances, the metal sites were not affected, and
therefore, the activity of Cu/Zn-SOD complexed with the caffeine molecule
changed little, as exhibited by the previous experiment. The optimized
result was chosen as the model. The calculated interaction energy
was −26.9489 kJ/mol, which also confirmed the previous experiment.
The goal was to bind a small molecule to SOD to form a complex.

Figure 10 Surface and
cartoon representations of caffeine in SOD.

Figure 10 shows
the solid surface of the hydrogen bond interaction between caffeine
and Cu/Zn-SOD. A small molecule was bound to the cavity of Cu/Zn-SOD,
and interactions, such as conventional hydrogen bonds, carbon hydrogen
bonds, and alkyl and Pi–alkyl interactions, occurred between
the amino acid residues and the caffeine molecule. In the caffeine–SOD
complex, hydrogen bonds were formed because of interactions between
caffeine and the residues in two protein subdomains via Val7. A, Asn51.
A, Lys9. B, Asn51. B, and Val146 B. Carbon hydrogen bonds were formed
with Cys144. A, Gly145. B, Val7. B, Asn51. A, and Lys9. B. Pi–alkyl
interactions were formed with Val146. A, Lys9. A, and Val7. B. The
caffeine–SOD complex is illustrated in Figure 10. The abovementioned interactions lowered
the energy of the complex.

3 Results
In conclusion, the antioxidant activities of caffeine, SOD, and
caffeine combined with SOD were studied by pyrogallol autoxidation
and detecting the concentration of MDA present in cells. The experimental
results show that caffeine has a good inhibitory effect on MDA content
under the action of heating and heavy metals, but caffeine cannot
eliminate superoxide radicals. The complexation of SOD with caffeine
causes an superimposed effect on its antioxidant ability without changing
the activity of Cu/Zn-SOD. The interaction between SOD and caffeine
was studied by fluorescence spectroscopy, UV absorption spectroscopy,
and molecular modelling. The UV–vis absorption spectroscopy
shows that caffeine can cause the red shift and decrease of UV-absorption
of SOD, suggesting that the complexation of SOD with caffeine can
change the secondary structure of SOD. The fluorescence spectroscopy
shows that the fluorescence quenching mechanism of SOD combined with
caffeine is static. The binding constants, binding sites, and thermodynamic
parameters of the complexation of SOD with caffeine at five different
temperatures indicate that SOD and caffeine can form a 1:1 complex
through the spontaneous formation of hydrogen bonds and van der Waals
force. The experimental results are in accordance with the results
of theoretical calculations. UV–vis spectroscopy and fluorescence
spectroscopy suggest that the complexation of SOD with caffeine can
change the conformation and microenvironment of SOD. The pyrogallol
autoxidation and molecular modeling show that the complexation of
SOD with caffeine has no effect on the active center of SOD. All the
results show that the complexation of SOD with caffeine did not affect
the SOD active sites and that the antioxidant ability is superimposed.
All the abovementioned results indicate that SOD can be used as an
effective carrier of caffeine.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Reagents
Cu/Zn-SOD was purchased
from Doulai Biotechnology Co., Ltd. Caffeine (98% purity) was purchased
from Tokyo Chemical Industry. Cu/Zn-SOD was diluted with distilled
water to obtain a 4 mg/mL solution, and the resulting solution was
stored at 4 °C. Caffeine was dissolved with distilled water to
prepare a 2 mmol/L solution. A 0.05 M Tris-HCl buffer solution with
pH = 8.2 was prepared. All other reagents are analytically pure.

4.2 Measurements of the MDA Content
MDA
produced by peroxidation is the most common indicator of lipid peroxidation.
The improved thiobarbituric acid (TBA)–MDA assay can satisfactorily
detect the concentration of MDA.33 Under
acidic conditions or at high temperatures, MDA reacts with TBA to
form 3,5,5-trimethyl oxazole-2,4-ketone 3,5,5-trimethyloxazolidine-2,4-dione,
which has a maximum absorption at 532 nm and a minimum absorption
at 600 nm. A saccharide and RBA complex also has a minimum absorption
at 532 nm and a maximum absorption at 450 nm. To eliminate the interference
of the saccharide complex, dual-wavelength spectrophotometry was applied.
The concentration of MDA was calculated by formulas 7 and 8. 7   8  C1— the
concentration of the carbohydrate; C2—the
concentration of MDA; A450—the
absorbance values at 450 nm; A532—the
absorbance values at 532 nm; A600—the
absorbance values 600 nm.

The same part of spinach leaves without
stems were suspended in 5 mL of 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the
resulting mixture was mixed with different concentrations of caffeine,
SOD, metal ions, SOD combined with caffeine, and SOD combined with
metal ions. Then, to the mixture, 0.6% thiobarbituric acid (5 mL)
was added. The homogenates without metal ions were heated at 373 K
for 15 min, cooled quickly, and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 20 min.
The homogenates with metal ions were centrifuged without heating.
The absorbances of all assay mixtures were recorded at 450, 532, and
600 nm.

4.3 Determination of the Cu/Zn-SOD Activity
A pyrogallol autoxidation method was chosen to analyze the antioxidant
activity of Cu/Zn-SOD. Solutions (3.5 mL) containing SOD and caffeine
(with concentrations ranging from 0 to 1 μM) were prepared using
a 0.05 M Tris-HCl buffer with pH = 8.2; before the test, 0.5 μM
pyrogallol was rapidly added to the solutions containing SOD and caffeine.
A caffeine solution prepared with the buffer at the same concentration
was used as the blank control. The absorption was measured as a function
of time at 325 nm and 303 K.

4.4 Ultraviolet Absorption
Measurements
At 25 °C, the ultraviolet absorption spectra
of Cu/Zn-SOD with
and without caffeine were obtained from 190 to 400 nm using an 8000
A spectrophotometer which was made by Beijing Purkinje General Corporation.
The mixtures of Cu/Zn-SOD with different concentrations of caffeine
in 3.5 mL Tris-HCl (0.05 M) buffer at pH = 8.2 were equilibrated for
20 min before their use. Using the solution of caffeine and
buffer at the same concentration as reference to reduce the impacts
of caffeine.

4.5 Fluorescence Measurements
A FluoroMax-4
fluorescence spectrophotometer (Horibajy, France) equipped with a
1 cm quartz cell and a thermostat bath was applied to detect the fluorescence
spectrometry. The caffeine and SOD solutions were mixed and stored
at a constant temperature for 30 minutes prior to their use. Furthermore,
the Tris-HCl (0.05 M) buffer at pH = 8.2 was also used in fluorescence
measurements. The excitation and emission slits were fixed at 10 nm,
and the excitation wavelength was 275 nm. The fluorescence lifetimes
were measured by the time-correlated single-photon counting method.
The emission spectrums were collected from 290 to 400 nm and recorded
at 298, 303, 308, 310, and 312 K.

4.6 Molecular
Modeling Study
Receptor–ligand
interaction of caffeine with Cu/Zn-SOD was carried out via Discovery
Studio 2018 soft platform (DS 2018). The software also specializes
in molecular docking, including calculation about molecular interaction
between macromolecules and small molecules.34,35 The structure of caffeine was drawn, prepared, and minimized to
give two conformations with small molecule tools of DS 2018 as optimized
ligand. Bovine SOD was chosen as protein model (PDB ID: 1CBJ). By macromolecules
tools, all water molecules of the SOD were removed, hydrogens were
added, and amino acid residues were completed. Receptor–ligand
tools (CDDOCKER) were used to analyze the interaction of caffeine
and macromolecule, with CHARMm force field, 10 orientations to refine.
Other parameters were set as default.
