A new
series of amphiphilic pyrrolidone diblock copolymers poly[N-(2-methacrylaoyxyethyl)pyrrolidone]-block-poly(methyl methacrylate) (PNMPm-b-PMMAn; where m is fixed at 37 and n is varied from 45 to 378)
is developed. Spontaneously situ-gelling behaviors are observed in
isopropanol when n varies from 117 to 230, whereas
only dissolution or precipitation appears when n is
beyond this region. Further analysis reveals that uniform thermoinduced
reversible gel–sol transitions are observed in those organogels,
which is attributed to the disassembly from micellar networks to micelles
as confirmed by electron microscopy and other techniques. The gel–sol
transition temperature is highly dependent on n and
increases as n increases. Conformational interactions
analyzed using 1H NMR and 2D Noesy NMR suggest that the
thermoinduced stretch of solvophilic PNMP segments within micelles
and the sequencing variation in the isopropanol molecules are the
major cause of the gel–sol transitions.

Introduction
Amphiphilic block copolymers
can form self-organized nanostructures
in solutions with diversified morphologies such as spherical and cylindrical
micelles, vesicles, and fibers, which are widely used in the development
of self-healing materials,1−3 drug-controlled release systems,4−6 catalysis,7,8 and so forth. Such polymers with
controllable solvophobic–solvophilic balance by regulating
environmental factors such as pH, temperature, light, and electric
field, or stimuli-responsive block copolymers, are extremely interesting
because their nanostructure morphologies are controllable.9−12 Development of
structurally controllable stimuli-responsive block copolymers, especially
those with low toxicity and excellent biocompatibility, as well as
their self-assembly behaviors, which are critically important in the
fields of medicine, life, biotechnology, and environment, is one of
the most attractive topics currently.13−16

Polymer gels are
often considered a category of supermolecular 3D networks17 of fiber-, line-, and ribbonlike nanostructures
and are advantageous because of their hydrogen bonds,18,19 dynamic covalent bonds,20 π–π21 and coordination22−24 interactions, and so
forth. Recently, a new type of gels composed of 3D micellar networks
that realized the transitions between spherical polymer micelles and
3D micellar gels reversibly through adjusting the temperature was
also reported.25−29 For example,
Gupta and co-authors reported a thermoresponsive 3D micellar gel based
on the cyto-protective triblock copolymer poly[(propylenesulfide)-block-(N,N-dimethylacylamide)-block-(N-isopropylacrylamide)], which was
used in the controlled release of drugs in vivo successfully.30 The chemical composition, polymerization degree,
and the ratio of blocks with different properties of block copolymers
all affect the gelling behaviors strongly. In other words, the nature
of the polymer is primary in those gelling processes.31 In addition, the importance of solvents cannot be neglected
because it affects the overall solvophobic–solvophilic balance
of diblock copolymers directly.17

Pyrrolidone has been a well-known environmentally friendly chemical
for decades and is rarely used in the development of block copolymers
although its polymeric form, polyvinylpyrrolidone, has been used widely.32−36 We first reported a controllable way to develop pyrrolidone-based
block copolymer amphiphiles, poly(methacrylic acid)-block-poly[N-(2-methacryloylxyethyl)pyrrolidone] (PMAA-b-PNMP)37 and poly(laurylmethacrylate)-block-poly[N-(2-methacryloylxyethyl)pyrrolidone]
(PLMA-b-PNMP),38 which
showed interesting aggregation behaviors and were used to control
the formation of gold nanoparticles successfully. Recently, Armes
have reported that self-organized nano-objects of poly(stearylmethacrylate)-block-poly[N-(2-methacryloyloxyethyl)pyrrolidone]
(PSMA-b-PNMP), the homologous of PLMA-b-PNMP, in dodecane were excellent emulsifiers to stabilize Pickering
emulsions.39 The major difference between
PLMA-b-PNMP and PMAA-b-PNMP comes
from the hydrophobic PLMA and the hydrophilic PMAA segments. The structural
similarity between PLMA and PMAA provides an alternative way to adjust
the solvophobic–solvophilic balance of the pyrrolidone diblock
copolymers through altering the alkyl chain length of methacrylate
monomers, thereby manipulating the self-assembly behaviors to expand
the corresponding applications.

Herein, a new family of pyrrolidone
diblock copolymers PNMP-b-PMMA, poly[N-(2-methacrylaoyxyethyl)pyrrolidone]-block-poly(methyl
methacrylate), is developed using the
reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) method
successfully. The self-assembly behavior of PNMP-b-PMMA in isopropanol is established, which leads to the finding of
a new category of 3D micellar networks organogels. The microstructure
and thermoresponse of those organogels are studied in detail by various
techniques including rheology, light scattering, and electron microscopy.
The conformational changes in both block copolymers and solvent molecules
during the gel–sol transition are also investigated by the
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra at the molecular level systematically.

Results
and Discussion
PNMP-b-PMMA Block Copolymers
All PNMP-b-PMMA block copolymers are synthesized
using the RAFT polymerization
method38 and are characterized using 1H NMR, gel permeation chromatography (GPC) well, which are
summarized in Table 1, and are described in detail in the Experimental
Section and Figures S1–S3. The polymerization degree of the PNMP segment for PNMP-b-PMMA is kept constant at 37, whereas that of the PMMA
segment is varied in a wide range between 45 and 378 to ensure sufficient
solvophobic–solvophilic balance variation in PNMP-b-PMMA, thereby leading to a rich self-assembly behavior.

a The polymerization degree m and n of PNMP and PMMA segments are calculated
from the 1H NMR results.

It is known that isopropanol is a good solvent for
PNMP homopolymers
and a poor one for PMMA homopolymers.40 Thus, the PNMP and PMMA segments of PNMP-b-PMMA
block copolymers are expected to play the role as solvophilic and
solvophobic parts, respectively, providing PNMP-b-PMMA amphiphilicity in isopropanol. Because the solvophilic PNMP
parts are kept constant in all polymers, the increase in n should enhance its solvophobicity and the micellization ability
of those block copolymers. The critical micelle concentrations (cmc)
of PNMP37-b-PMMA117, PNMP37-b-PMMA151, PNMP37-b-PMMA189, and PNMP37-b-PMMA230 measured using static light scattering
(SLS) are 0.026, 0.016, 0.015, and 0.013 wt % (Figure S4a), respectively, confirming that PNMP37-b-PMMAn with a larger n favors micellization evidently. Dynamic light scattering
(DLS) results show that the micellar size is increased upon increasing n (Figure S4b) because of the
increase in the solvophobic micellar core. In addition,38 the morphology of micelles is spherical as observed
from the transmission electron microscopy measurements (Figure S4c).

In addition, the self-assembly
behavior of PNMP-b-PMMA block copolymers in isopropanol
shows high dependency on n. Opaque organogels are
formed when n is
between 117 and 230, whereas only dissolution or precipitation is
observed for others (Figure S5a). Moreover,
those organogels can transform into transparent solutions upon heating
(Figure S5b) and regelling reversibly through
cooling, indicating the typical behavior of thermoresponsive gels,
which will be discussed further in the next section.

PNMP-b-PMMA Organogels in Isopropanol
The dynamic strain-sweeping
results of 5 wt % PNMP-b-PMMA organogels (Figure 1a) show that both
the storage modulus G′
and the loss modulus G″ remain almost invariable
on gradually increasing the strain in a wide region, with G′ remaining over G″, and
then dropping sharply above a critical stain value for each copolymer,
corresponding to the mechanical break of organogels.41 It is also noticed that the values of G′ and G″ as well as the critical strain
value are increased for PNMP-b-PMMA with a larger n, suggesting that the increase in n strengthens
the mechanical intensity of organogels. Moreover, the organogels have
relatively high yield stresses of approximately 100 Pa except that
of PNMP37-b-PMMA117, indicating
that very stable microstructures are formed. Figure 1b shows the corresponding dynamic frequency-sweeping
results of PNMP-b-PMMA that the storage modulus G′ is generally larger than the loss modulus G″ regardless of frequency, indicating that the organogels
mainly exhibit elasticity.42

Figure 1 The dynamic
strain-sweeping (a) and frequency-sweeping (b) results
of 5 wt % PNMP-b-PMMA organogels in isopropanol at
20 °C; the open and solid symbols represent G′ and G″, respectively.

Figure 2 shows the
corresponding microstructures of 5 wt % PNMP-b-PMMA
organogels in isopropanol, and all samples are freeze-dried before
the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations. Similar coral-like
microstructures, corresponding to the cross-linked nanoparticles with
a size of approximately tens of nanometers, are observed in all organogel
samples, suggesting that the organogels are composed of 3D networks
of PNMP-b-PMMA spherical micelles directly. As mentioned
in the Introduction section, fiber-, line-,
or ribbon-like microstructures are often dominant in gelation systems.17 However, similar situ-gelling processes based
on 3D micellar networks are rarely reported,43 and the delicate balance between solvency and nonsolvency of a block
copolymer,44 or the solvophobic–solvophilic
balance, is the major cause. For example, the polyethylene glycol
segment is often used to design the copolymer gels with 3D micellar
networks through adjusting the interactions between block copolymers
and solvents.45

% PNMP-b-PMMA organogels

Thermoresponse of PNMP-b-PMMA Organogels
The thermoinduced gel–sol transitions of PNMP-b-PMMA organogels are investigated using turbidity, as shown in Figure 3a. Clearly, the transmittance
is increased steeply at a given temperature for each PNMP-b-PMMA upon heating and returns reversibly through cooling,
indicating that the gel–sol transition is reversible. The gel–sol
transition temperature is a function of the polymerization degree n of the PMMA segment. The larger the n, the higher the transition temperature. For example, the temperatures
of PNMP37-b-PMMA117 and PNMP37-b-PMMA230 are approximately
27 and 50 °C, respectively. It is reasonable because the solvophobic
interactions of PNMP-b-PMMA are strengthened by increasing
the polymerization degree n of the PMMA segment.
Further analysis shows that the gel–sol transition temperature
is also related to the concentration of PNMP-b-PMMA
strongly (Figure 3b).
The transition temperature increases as the polymer concentration
increases in the low concentration region (<5 wt %) and then becomes
nearly constant for each block copolymer, and a similar finding was
previously reported in other gelling systems.46

gel–sol transition temperature of PNMP-b-PMMA

To understand the nature
of PNMP-b-PMMA in isopropanol
solution, 5 wt % PNMP37-b-PMMA117 is representatively studied further using DLS and cryogenic TEM
(cryo-TEM) techniques because of its lower gel–sol transition
temperature (Figure 3a). Figure 4a shows
the particle size distribution at various temperatures. Obviously,
the
presence of particles with a radius (Rh) of approximately tens of nanometers in the solution was confirmed
by cryo-TEM imaging, suggesting the formation of micelles (Figure 4b). The inset image
in Figure 4a shows
the variation in the micellar size with the temperature. The higher
the temperature, the smaller the size. It is worthwhile to mention
that the average diameter of micelles is determined using the cryo-TEM
image to be approximately 22 nm (Figure S6), which is consistent with the size measured using DLS (∼20
nm) in a 50 °C well, yet it is smaller than the other temperatures.
This can be attributed to the thermoinduced thinning in the solvable
layer of micelles and the dispersion of connected micelles,47 which is also the major cause in the temperature-induced
micellar size decrease (the inset image in Figure 4a).

wt % PNMP37-b-PMMA117 in isopropanol

corresponding cryo-TEM image (b) at 30 °C. The inset image in

Molecular Interactions
of PNMP-b-PMMA in Organogels
and Solution States
Electron microscopy results indicate
that the thermoinduced gel–sol transitions are attributed to
the disassembly of micellar networks, and the microenvironmental variation
in PNMP-b-PMMA is further studied by NMR techniques
at the molecular level. Figure 5 shows the 1H NMR spectra of 5 wt % PNMP37-b-PMMA151, the polymer with a typical
gel–sol transition temperature of approximately 39 °C
(Figure 3a), in d8-isopropanol.

Figure 5 Temperature-dependent 1H NMR
spectra of 5 wt % PNMP37-b-PMMA151 in d8-isopropanol, and the inset images
show the molecular
structures of PNMP37-b-PMMA151 and isopropanol.

No obvious chemical shift
is observed at different temperatures.
However, the resolution and intensity of peaks for nearly all protons
are strengthened significantly above 40 °C, which is well consistent
with its gel–sol transition temperature. Similar results are
also observed in other amphiphilic systems and are often attributed
to the formation of smaller aggregates because the polymeric chains
become less restricted.48 The proton signals
in 1H NMR spectra are often highly related to the location
of their microenvironments. Herein, the solvophobic PMMA
segments are located in the micellar core both in the organogel and
in the solution states; hence, little changes in the microenvironments
are observed. However, the solvophilic PNMP segments come in contact
with isopropanol directly, and thereby, the thermoinduced disassembly
of micellar networks should mainly be caused by the microenvironmental
changes in the PNMP segments.

Figure 6a,b shows
the 2D Noesy NMR spectra of 5 wt % PNMP37-b-PMMA151 in both organogels and solution states. Significant
conformational changes in both block copolymers and solvents are observed
from the cross-peaks as signed by the boxes 1–3 in Figure 6a. For the diblock
copolymer PNMP37-b-PMMA151,
remarkable conformational interactions from the PNMP segments in the
organogel state including those between Ha and Hc (box 1), Hd,e and Hg, and Hd,e and
Hf (box 3) are observed at 25 °C, which disappeared
completely in the solution state at 55 °C. However, nearly no
visible conformational interactions are observed from the proton Hh of the PMMA segments regardless of the environmental temperature.
The results evidently show that the gel–sol transition is mainly
attributed to the microenvironmental changes in the solvophilic PNMP
parts of the block copolymers, indicating that those moieties including
the pyrrolidone rings and the main chains of block copolymers in micelles
must be packed very closely in the gelling state.

Figure 6 2D Noesy NMR spectra
of 5 wt % PNMP37-b-PMMA151 in d8-isopropanol
at 25 (a) and 55 °C (b), respectively.

It should be
mentioned that the conformational interactions marked by boxes 1 and
3 might come from both the coiled PNMP segments within the micelles
and the interdigitated solvophilic PNMP layers of different micelles.
Undoubtedly, the distance between the pyrrolidone ring and the main
chain of the block copolymers should be widened in the solution state,
or in other words, the PNMP segments become more stretched in the
solution than in the gelling state, resulting in the weakening of
all conformational interactions from the PNMP segments. Simultaneously,
similar findings are also observed in the residual protons of solvents
that the strong conformational interactions between H1 and
H2 (box 2) of isopropanol molecules in the organogel are
also invisible in the solution, suggesting that heating also weakens
the conformational interactions of isopropanol molecules. It is well-known
that the molecular thermodynamic movement would be enhanced upon increasing
the temperature,49 thereby weakening the
conformational interactions of the isopropanol molecules.

Conclusions
In summary, we report a new family of pyrrolidone-based amphiphilic
diblock copolymers PNMPm-b-PMMAn, which are synthesized using the
controlled RAFT polymerization method. It is noticed that their self-assembly
behaviors in isopropanol depend strongly on the polymerization degree n of PMMA when the polymerization degree m of PNMP is fixed at 37. More interestingly,
these copolymers form thermoresponsive and opaque organogels composed
of 3D micellar networks when n is between 117 and
230. Those organogels could transform into thinning fluids composed
of spherical micelles upon heating and regelling reversibly through
cooling. Conformational interactions of PNMP-b-PMMA
molecules in the organogel and solution analyzed using 1H NMR and 2D Noesy NMR reveal that the stretch of the solvophilic
part PNMP plays an important role in the gel–sol transition
process, and the thermoinduced sequencing variation in the isopropanol
molecules as well. According to the interesting situ-forming gelling
behaviors and the excellent biocompatibility of PNMP-b-PMMA components, this new family of block copolymers may offer some
potential applications in transdermal drug delivery, biotechnology,
nanomaterials development, and so forth.

Experimental Section
Materials
2-Cyanopropyl-2-dithiobenzoate (CPDB) was
synthesized according to the reported method.50 2,2′-Azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN, 99%) was purchased from
Shanghai Hatech Co. Ltd. and recrystallized in ethanol twice. N-Hydroxyethyl pyrrolidone (98%, TCI), methacryloyl chloride,
and methyl methacrylate (98%, Shanghai Hatech Co. Ltd.) were distilled
under reduced pressure before use. Dimethylformamide (DMF, 99%, Shanghai
Hatech Co. Ltd.) was distilled under reduced pressure, then mixed
with 0.05 mol·L–1 of NaNO3 (99%,
Shanghai Hatech Co. Ltd.), and filtered on 0.2 μm polytetrafluoroethylene
filters for GPC. NMP was synthesized using the method described elsewhere.51 All other solvents and reagents were purchased
from commercial sources and were used as received.

Synthesis of
PNMP-b-PMMA Block Copolymer
PNMP-b-PMMA was synthesized according to the same
procedure as reported previously38 (Scheme 1):

Scheme 1 Synthetic Route of
PNMPm-b-PMMAn
The typical synthetic procedure of PNMP macromolecular
chain transfer
agent (macro-CTA) is as follows: NMP (25.5 g, 129.44 mmol), CPDB (0.60
g, 2.70 mmol), AIBN (0.168 g, 1.03 mmol), and CH3CH2OH (50 mL) were charged into a 100 mL Schlenk flask capped
with rubber septa. Subsequently, the homogenous solution was deoxygenated
by purging with highly pure nitrogen gas for 30 min and then reacted
at 60 °C for 10 h under stirring in a thermostatic oil bath.
The monomer conversion was 93% as calculated from the 1H NMR spectrum using 1,3,5-trioxane as the internal standard. The
crude product was diluted by dichloromethane and then poured into
diethyl ether/petroleum ether mixture (v/v = 1:1) to precipitate at
least twice. The final product was dried in a vacuum oven at 45 °C
to give a pink powder. The mean polymerization degree m of PNMP macro-CTA agent was 37 as calculated from the 1H NMR spectrum (Figure S1) and GPC analysis: Mn = 8310 g·mol–1; Mw/Mn = 1.03 (Figure S2).

The PNMP-b-PMMA diblock copolymer was synthesized
as follows: PNMP macro-CTA (2.0 g, 0.30 mmol), MMA (8.24 g, 82.40
mmol), AIBN (0.0183 g 0.11 mmol), and DMF (22 mL) were charged into
a 50 mL Schlenk flask capped with rubber septa and then reacted and
purified as mentioned earlier. The final product is a pink powder.
The mean polymerization degree n of the PMMA segment
was 189 as calculated from the 1H NMR spectrum (Figure S3) and GPC analysis: Mn = 31110 g·mol–1; Mw/Mn = 1.04 (Figure S2).

1H NMR and 2D Noesy NMR Spectra
Measurements
1H NMR spectra were recorded on a
400 MHz Bruker-BioSpin
spectrometer. The temperature-dependent 1H NMR experiment
of 5 wt % PNMP37-b-PMMA151 in d8-isopropanol was performed in the temperature
region between 25 and 55 °C with an interval of 5 °C, and
the equilibrium time was 20 min at each temperature. Two-dimensional
(2D) nuclear Overhauser effect spectrometry (Noesy) NMR measurements
were recorded on the Bruker BioSpin GmbH NMR spectrometer with a proton
frequency of 500.13 Hz at 25 and 55 °C, respectively. A 90°
pulse width of 8.53 μs, a mixing time of 200 ms, a relaxation
delay of 2 s, and an acquisition time of 205 ms were used. As many
as 2048 complex points were collected and processed with a Lorentz-to-Gauss
window function and zero filling in both dimensions to display data
on a 2048 × 2048 2D matrix.

GPC Measurements
The GPC measurements were recorded
at 35 °C using DMF (containing 0.05 M NaNO3) as an
eluant at a flow rate of 1.0 mL·min–1. The
column set consisted of two MZ-SD plus 5 μm columns (500 Å
and Linear); a Wyatt Optilab DSP Interferometric refractometer and
a Wyatt DAWN EOS multiangle laser light scattering detector with a
helium–neon laser light source (λ = 685 nm), K5-flow
cell, and a broad range of scattering angles from 45°–160°
were used. The molecular weight and polydispersity data were determined
using the Wyatt ASTRA software package. The refractive index increment
of the polymer solution (dn/dc)
was measured using an Optilab DSP refractometer at a wavelength of
685 nm.

Gel–Sol Transition Temperature Measurements
The gel–sol transition behaviors of PNMP-b-PMMA in isopropanol were studied by the tube tilting method52 as follows: each sample with a given concentration
was prepared by dissolving the block copolymer in isopropanol through
heating and stirring to form a clear and homogenous solution, and
the gel was obtained by cooling the sample to ambient temperature
and stored at 4 °C overnight. The vials, which were tightly sealed,
were immersed in a water bath from 10 to 50 °C increasing by
1 °C per step. Each temperature was equilibrated for 15 min,
and then the vials were inverted for 1 min to determine the condensed
state. The state was regarded as a gel if the aqueous system in the
vial did not flow within 1 min of inverting the vial.

Turbidity Measurements
The turbidity measurements were
recorded using a UV–visible Tu-1901 spectrometer (Pgeneral,
China) at 600 nm. The transmittance was measured between 0 and 70
°C through temperature-controlled heating and cooling cycles,
and the sample was equilibrated for 30 min at each temperature before
measurement.

Rheology Measurements
Rheology measurements
were recorded
on a RS 600 stress-controlled rheometer (TA Instruments) using a cone–plate
geometry (diameter of 35 mm and a cone angle of 1°) at 20 °C.
The distance between the sensor and the cone plate was adjusted to
52 μm for all measurements, and a solvent-trapping device was
placed above the plate to minimize evaporation. The strain-sweeping
experiments were performed at the fixed frequency (ω = 1 rad·s–1), and the frequency-sweeping measurements was taken
at a constant shear strain of 1 Pa.

Light Scattering Measurements
SLS and DLS were performed
on the Zetasizer ZEN 3600 (Malvern, U.K.) with a 173° back scattering
angle using a He–Ne laser (λ = 633 nm). The sample was
filtered through a 0.22 μm filter membrane to remove any interfering
dust particles and equilibrated for 30 min before each measurement.

Electron Microscopy Measurements
The SEM experiments
were performed on a Zeiss Sigma field-emission scanning electron microscope.
The samples were lyophilized before the SEM observation. Before the
examination, the solid sample was placed on a double-sided sticky
carbon tape mounted on aluminum sample holders, and then it was sputter-coated
with a thin layer of gold using an SCD 005 cool sputter coater (Bal-Tec)
at 30 mA and ∼7 Pa for 80 s.

cryo-TEM was performed as
follows: A small drop of the sample (3–5 μL) was deposited
on the surface of a TEM copper grid covered by a holey carbon film
at 30 °C. After blotting away the excess solution to form a thin
liquid film, the grid was immediately plunged into liquid ethane cooled
by liquid nitrogen (−175 °C). The specimens were maintained
at approximately −173 °C and imaged using a transmission
electron microscope Tecnai G20 TWIN at an accelerating voltage of
200 kV under low-dose conditions.
