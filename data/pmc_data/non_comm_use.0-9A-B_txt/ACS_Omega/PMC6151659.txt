Corrosion
protection of steel obtained with physical vapor deposition
(PVD) coatings can be further improved by sealing the intrinsic pinholes
with atomic layer deposition (ALD) coatings. In this work, the effect
of surface wear on corrosion protection obtained by a hybrid PVD CrN/ALD
Al2O3/TiO2 nanolaminate coating was
studied. The samples were investigated by alternating surface wear
steps and exposure to salt solution and consecutively the progression
of corrosion after each wear and each corrosion step was evaluated.
Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive
spectroscopy showed that the rust spots were almost exclusively located
on positions at which the wear steps had removed the top surface of
the PVD CrN coating. Nevertheless, even after complete removal of
the ALD nanolaminate from the top of the CrN surface by sandpaper
grinding, the corrosion current density was less than half compared
to the PVD CrN coating alone without surface wear. Cross-sectional
SEM images obtained with focused ion beam milling showed not only
the presence of the ALD coating at the CrN defects but also the opening
of new pathways for the corrosion to attack the substrate. A mechanism
for the effect of wear on the structure and corrosion protection of
hybrid PVD/ALD coatings is proposed on the basis of this investigation.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Thin film coating technology
enables control of surface-related
properties, such as corrosion resistance, while allowing underlying
substrates to be chosen for strength and toughness.1 Of various thin film coating methods, atomic layer deposition
(ALD) has recently shown great promise in corrosion protection of
steel.2−10 Unfortunately, the practically limited thickness and comparatively
small hardness of ALD coatings make it unsuitable for applications
under heavy load, such as cutting instruments. More durable corrosion
protection can be obtained by micrometer-thick hard physical vapor
deposition (PVD) coatings, such as CrN.11−13 The weakness of these
coatings is that they possess a large amount of defects and pinholes,
through which the corrosion can attack the less noble steel, resulting
in heavy localized corrosion.14 Pinhole
sealing by ALD coatings has been reported to greatly counteract this,
improving the corrosion protection.4,7,10

The successful sealing of high-aspect-ratio
(HAR) defects and pinholes
with differing geometries is possible by ALD due to the self-saturating
surface reactions that allow conformal and uniform deposition on three-dimensional
morphologies.15,16 With standard ALD mode, conformal
deposition on up to 200:1 aspect ratios has been reported.17 Combining the chemical stability of TiO2 or Ta2O5 with the excellent sealing
properties of Al2O3 has been shown to give enhanced
corrosion protection.3,8 Although the sealing of PVD pinholes
has been shown by both corrosion measurements and focused ion beam
(FIB) cross-sectioning,4,10 the effect of surface wear on
structure and obtained corrosion protection by hybrid PVD/ALD coatings
has not been reported previously.

The hypothesis of this work
was that if the excellent corrosion
protection by hybrid PVD/ALD coating is due to PVD pinhole sealing
of ALD coating, the surface wear of the hybrid coating should have
negligible effect on the corrosion protection properties. The investigation
was conducted by alternating the corrosion exposure of the coated
steel (salt solution) and wear of the surface, resulting in gradual
increase of surface wear until a major loss in the corrosion protection
was observed by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements and optical
microscopy. After the last wear step, cross-sectioning of the sample
surface by focused ion beam (FIB) milling and consecutive scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) verified the existence of ALD coating in
the defects of the CrN. The defects in PVD coatings can be identified
as the main pathway for the corrosion to attack the steel substrate,
and ALD can be used to seal these pinholes.

2 Results
and Discussion
Hereafter, the samples are described with
a running numbering in
the form of LSVX-WearY, in which X stands for the number of LSV tests done (1–5) and Y stands for the number of wear steps (0–4). See Section 4 for details.

2.1 Electrochemical Measurements
Figure 1 shows the results
of LSV measurements. Figure 1a shows polarization curves before any wear (LSV1-Wear0),
whereas Figure 1b shows
the polarization curves at the end of the investigation for both,
with wear (LSV5-Wear4) and without wear. From Figure 1a, it is seen that the CrN coating initially
reduces the corrosion current density approximately with an order
of magnitude compared to noncoated high-speed steel (HSS) and shifts
the corrosion potential to less negative. With addition of ALD coating,
corrosion current density is reduced further by almost 2 orders of
magnitude due to the sealing of pinholes. Similar results have been
reported previously by growing ALD nanolaminates on PVD CrN coatings.4,10 Wearing the top surface of the hybrid PVD/ALD coating reduces the
corrosion protection to some extent. As seen in Figure 1b, the corrosion current density is almost
an order of magnitude higher with the extensive surface wear of the
sample LSV5-Wear4. The corrosion potential has also moved to −700
mV, close to the value of the PVD CrN coating itself.10 This is as expected, as the ALD nanolaminate has been completely
removed from the top surface of the PVD CrN coating. Even after the
complete removal, the corrosion current density of worn hybrid PVD/ALD
coatings is still less than half compared to the CrN coating only,
without any wear.

Figure 1 Polarization curves for the electrochemical measurements
(a) before
wear (LSV1-Wear0) and (b) after five LSV measurements and approximately
13 h in salt solution. Results for both samples, with wear (LSV5-Wear4)
and without wear, are shown.

Figure 2 shows
all
LSV measurement results (Figure 2a for corrosion potential, and Figure 2b for corrosion current density), with each
measurement point averaged from the three LSV measurements done. For
HSS, the surface is completely rusted and corrosion potential has
stabilized to approximately −1000 mV already after the second
LSV measurement. With the CrN coating, corrosion potential and corrosion
current density approach those of noncoated HSS with increasing amount
of time in salt solution and LSV measurements done. Wearing the CrN
surface has a minor effect on the electrochemical behavior, as the
differences between samples with and without wear are generally smaller
than the measurement variation.

Figure 2 (a) Corrosion potentials and (b) corrosion
current densities versus
the number of LSV measurements done. The bottom axis shows the total
number of the LSV measurements done. The total contact time to the
salt solution was approximately 2.5 h for each LSV measurement. The
top axis shows the amount of wear steps in samples with wear—the
first three wear steps were with ball-on-disk, and the last one was
by sandpaper grinding. Each data point was averaged from three measurements,
and the mean of standard deviation was used as error bars.

After the first three wear steps, the corrosion
current density
for the hybrid PVD/ALD-coated HSS slightly increases, whereas the
corrosion potential remains approximately the same. Only after the
complete removal of the ALD nanolaminate from the PVD CrN surface,
a notable difference is observed between the samples without wear
as the corrosion potential has moved to a more negative value (−560
mV) and the corrosion current density has increased by an order of
magnitude.

Heavy wear with material removal from the top of
the PVD CrN surface
can open pinholes and defects that were previously closed and thus
not sealed by the ALD coating. Wear can also cause cracks that might
propagate through the whole PVD coating.18 This would create new pathways for corrosion to attack the steel
substrate, resulting in corrosion current density closer to the values
obtained by the PVD CrN coating protection alone. Nevertheless, the
initially open voids remain sealed by the ALD nanolaminate, and the
corrosion current density of the worn hybrid PVD/ALD-coated HSS is
still less than half of that with the PVD CrN coating only.

2.2 Surface Analysis on Wear and Corrosion
Figures 3–5 show the optical microscopy images of each sample
type after each test step. Figure 3 shows that the surface of the noncoated HSS is rusted
already after one LSV measurement (Figure 3a), and this rusting progresses by further
LSV measurements and time in salt solution (Figure 3c,e,g,i). The wear steps carried out for
the noncoated disks (Figure 3b,d,e,h) remove rust from the surface, as observed from the
lighter color of the wear tracks.

Figure 3 Optical microscopy images after each measurement
step for noncoated
HSS: (a) LSV1-Wear0, (b) LSV1-Wear1, (c) LSV2-Wear1, (d) LSV2-Wear2,
(e) LSV3-Wear2, (f) LSV3-Wear3, (g) LSV4-Wear3, (h) LSV4-Wear4 (sandpaper
grinding), and (i) LSV5-Wear4.

The surface of the PVD CrN coating is oxidized in the LSV
measurements,
as can be seen in Figure 4. The final wear step by sandpaper grinding (Figure 4h) has removed all of the oxidized
CrN surface. The grinding step has also removed the wear tracks from
first two wear steps with shorter run distance. Some rusted steel
surface is observed as dark areas on wear tracks after the second
LSV measurement (Figure 4c), and the amount of these areas increases as the test progresses.

Figure 4 Optical
microscopy images after each measurement step for the CrN-coated
HSS: (a) LSV1-Wear0, (b) LSV1-Wear1, (c) LSV2-Wear1, (d) LSV2-Wear2,
(e) LSV3-Wear2, (f) LSV3-Wear3, (g) LSV4-Wear3, (h) LSV4-Wear4 (sandpaper
grinding), and (i) LSV5-Wear4.

As seen in Figure 5, the hybrid PVD/ALD-coated surface appears
initially unaffected by corrosion. Surface oxidation of the PVD CrN
coating can be seen at wear tracks on the second LSV measurement (Figure 5c). After the third
LSV measurement, a small amount of rusted steel is observed as darker
area in Figure 5e.
The number of these dark spots increases as the testing progresses.
These rust spots are located preferentially at spots where the wear
tracks converge, such as in positions shown in Figure 5g. After sandpaper grinding, only wear tracks
from the longer total distance ball-on-disk test remain (Figure 5h). At this point,
the rust spots are almost solely located on these deepest wear tracks
(Figure 5h,i).

Figure 5 Optical microscopy
images after each measurement step for the hybrid
PVD/ALD-coated HSS: (a) LSV1-Wear0, (b) LSV1-Wear1, (c) LSV2-Wear1,
(d) LSV2-Wear2, (e) LSV3-Wear2, (f) LSV3-Wear3, (g) LSV4-Wear3, (h)
LSV4-Wear4 (sandpaper grinding), and (i) LSV5-Wear4.

The wear depth of individual ball-on-disk test
(25 m distance)
on PVD CrN coating was 90 ± 70 nm. The large variance was easily
observable in microscope images, with some areas having much greater
wear than others. The wear of the surface ALD coating can be assumed
rapid because it was observed to wear out at the very start of all
wear steps. Thus, the wear of the PVD CrN coating and the hybrid PVD/ALD
coating are the same within measurement variation. Sandpaper grinding
(Wear4) removed the ALD nanolaminate from the PVD
CrN surface in a few seconds. The grinding step (total time, 15 s)
removed approximately 100 nm of the PVD CrN. The approximate depths
of the rust spots observed at coated sample surfaces after LSV5-Wear4
was 22 ± 14 μm for the PVD CrN-coated samples (Figure 4i) and 12 ±
5 μm for the hybrid PVD CrN-coated samples (Figure 5i). Both of these values are
greater than coating thickness, showing that a significant amount
of base steel material has corroded and dissolved from these positions.
A larger amount of steel dissolution with the PVD CrN coating alone
coincides with the electrochemical measurement results.

Figure 6 shows photographs
of noncoated (Figure 6a,d), CrN-coated (Figure 6b,e), and hybrid PVD/ALD-coated (Figure 6c,f) steel disks after all of the measurements,
for both without wear and with wear (LSV5-Wear4). The noncoated HSS
is completely rusted in both cases (Figure 6a,d). The PVD CrN-coated samples appear quite
identical (Figure 6b,e), which is as expected by the electrochemical measurement results.
On the basis of the surface images, the profilometer results, and
the electrochemical analysis, most of the PVD CrN coating still remains
after the wear procedure, and the protection by the PVD CrN coating
alone is mostly unaffected by the surface wear. For the hybrid PVD/ALD-coated
HSS without wear (Figure 6c), there are only few small rust spots. In the case of the
hybrid-coated samples with wear, some surface oxidation of the CrN
coating is observed after the LSV5-Wear4 (Figure 6f). Additional rust spots are observed on
the wear tracks of the hybrid PVD/ALD-coated samples.

Figure 6 Photographs of the samples
at the end of measurements, after five
LSV measurements, and approximately 13 h in the salt solution. Samples
without wear are shown in the upper row: (a) noncoated, (b) CrN-coated,
and (c) hybrid PVD/ALD-coated. The lower row shows samples after the
LSV5-Wear4: (d) noncoated, (e) CrN-coated, and (f) hybrid PVD/ALD-coated.
For the samples in the lower row, ultrasonication was used to remove
the lacquer before taking the images.

The rust spots were observed to be located preferentially
at the
wear tracks of the PVD CrN-coated and hybrid PVD/ALD-coated steel. Figures 7 and 8 show SEM images of coated sample surfaces after LSV4-Wear3
and LSV5-Wear4, respectively. With the CrN coating only (Figures 7a and 8a), some rust spots are seen outside the wear tracks, whereas
for the hybrid PVD/ALD-coated HSS (Figures 7b and 8b), the rust
spots are almost exclusively located at the wear tracks. After grinding
the surface by sandpaper (LSV4-Wear4), only the deepest wear tracks
remain, and higher-magnification SEM images of rust spots in these
wear track positions are presented in Figure 8. These rust spots were up to 2 orders of
magnitude larger than the biggest pinholes (few micrometers) observed
in the CrN coating.

Figure 7 SEM images of sample surfaces after LSV4-Wear3 for (a)
the PVD
CrN-coated steel, where a notable amount of spot corrosion is observed,
preferentially on wear tracks, and (b) the hybrid PVD/ALD-coated steel,
where the corrosion is only observed at positions where wear tracks
converge.

Figure 8 SEM images of rust spots at the wear tracks
positions (vertical
direction in the image) after sandpaper grinding (LSV5-Wear4) for
(a) the PVD CrN-coated steel and (b) the hybrid PVD/ALD-coated steel.

The energy-dispersive spectrometry
(EDS) analysis gave strong Fe
signals from the rust spots. A strong Cr signal without any Fe or
Ti signal was observed from the wear tracks. For the hybrid PVD/ALD-coated
HSS after LSV4-Wear3, an EDS Ti Kα peak at 4.5 keV for the ALD
nanolaminate10 was observed outside the
wear tracks. At the edge of the wear track, increased aluminum signal
was obtained, indicating residues from the counterface alumina balls.

The area fraction (from the total contact area to salt solution)
of removed ALD nanolaminate after the final ball-on-disk test (LSV3-Wear3)
was approximately 66%. The final wear step (LSV4-Wear4) with sandpaper
removed the ALD coating completely and 100–200 nm CrN from
the top surface. Table 1 shows the total rust areas for samples with wear (LSV4-Wear3 and
LSV5-Wear4) and without wear (LSV5). For the noncoated HSS, the rust
area was equal to the total lacquer-limited contact area of the salt
solution (170 mm2). For the CrN-coated HSS, the area was
<1% of the total area after the LSV4-Wear3 and approximately 4%
after the LSV5-Wear4. With identical amount of LSV measurements and
time in salt solution (LSV5), but without any wear, the rust area
was <2%. The rust areas for the hybrid PVD/ALD-coated steel were
less than half of these values. For the hybrid PVD/ALD samples without
wear, the rust area was <0.05% after the LSV5. This negligible
amount of rust at the sample surfaces is in line with investigations
by Härkönen et al., where their PVD CrN/ALD nanolaminate-coated
steel remained corrosion free even after 168 h in neutral salt spray
test.4

a The total contact area to salt solution
was approximately 170 mm2. The total contact time to salt
solution (0.2 M NaCl) was about 13 h after the final LSV measurement.

2.3 SEM Imaging
of Defect Site Cross Sections
Prepared by Focused Ion Beam Milling
FIB/SEM images of the
hybrid PVD/ALD-coated sample after the whole test procedure (LSV5-Wear4)
are shown in Figures 9 and 10. Figure 9a shows a top-view SEM image of a major defect
on a wear track with a heavy local corrosion. A black line and an
arrow have been added to Figure 9a to illustrate the cross-sectioned line spot and the
view in Figure 9b,
respectively. The cross section shows clearly characteristic, grainlike
carbides in the steel and an edge of the PVD CrN coating on top of
the steel. The corrosion has progressed below the PVD CrN coating.
These observations are also in line with earlier research.10 Some of the PVD CrN coating appears collapsed.
The ALD nanolaminate can be seen at the bottom, following the varying
surface shapes conformally. It is notable that the ALD coating can
be found deeper than the bottom surface level of the PVD CrN coating;
it is plausible that the original defect in PVD CrN coating was caused
by a major defect on the steel surface, which prevented successful
PVD coating on this spot. The ALD coating would then have been deposited
to cover the bottom of this defect.

Figure 9 FIB/SEM analysis done on the hybrid PVD/ALD-coated
steel after
the LSV5-Wear4. Top view (a) of a major defect on a wear track. The
black arrow denotes the location of the cross-sectional image (b)
prepared by FIB milling.

Figure 10 FIB/SEM analysis done on the hybrid PVD/ALD-coated steel after
the LSV5-Wear4. Top view (a) of defect (shallow pit, probably left
by a particle). The black arrow indicates the location of the cross-sectional
image (b) prepared by FIB milling. Some milling artifacts are shown
along the diagonal direction in the steel area (final polishing z-depth too short).

The thickness of the ALD coating at the far ends of the defect
cavity is larger than 100 nm. This can be attributed to possible chemical
vapor deposition (CVD) reactions between the surfaces, precursors,
and byproducts. This is a known issue for ALD on complex shadowed
and other high-aspect-ratio (HAR) structures when precursors or byproducts
do not have enough time to diffuse out from the structure before the
following precursor pulse enters the space.19 Even with long purge time set in this investigation (10 s), complete
prevention of the parasitic CVD seems to be challenging due to the
high structural complexity of these HAR defect cavities.

Figure 10a shows
a top-view SEM image of a defect site outside of wear track. Only
the last wear step, sandpaper grinding, has affected this area. A
black line and arrow have been added to show the field of view for
the image of the prepared cross section shown in Figure 10b. The observed defect is
a shallow pit with mostly intact PVD CrN coating. Some corrosion has
progressed through the right-hand side of the recess. An approximately
100 nm thick layer can be observed at the right edge of the recess.
No such layer could be observed at the middle of the recess or at
the top surface outside the defect.

Probably, there has been
some kind of particle present at this
recess, which has mostly blocked the ALD deposition on the recess.
The sandpaper grinding has then removed the particle and ALD at the
top surface outside the recess, but ALD at the edge of the recess
and inside the PVD CrN coating remains. Removal of particle by sandpaper
grinding has also probably expanded the cracks observed at recess
in the PVD coating, and the one corrosion step carried out after the
sandpaper grinding has caused some steel dissolution at the right-hand
side of the recess.

2.4 Coefficient of Friction
(CoF) for the Hybrid
PVD/ALD Coating
Figure 11 shows coefficient of friction (CoF) value for ball-on-disk
measurement on the PVD CrN-coated and the hybrid PVD/ALD-coated steel
(LSV1-Wear1). The CoF of oxidized PVD CrN surface (see Figure 4b) is lower than that of PVD
CrN protected from surface oxidation by the ALD nanolaminate (0.44
± 0.03 vs 0.67 ± 0.04). This oxidized layer did wear away
as the tribometer test progressed, and the CoF approaches the value
for nonoxidized PVD CrN (0.67).

Figure 11 Coefficients of friction after LSV1-wear1
for the PVD CrN-coated
and hybrid PVD/ALD-coated HSS. The CoF for the oxidized PVD CrN is
lower than that for the nonoxidized PVD CrN.

For the hybrid PVD/ALD-coated steel, low CoF (0.16 ±
0.01)
of the ALD nanolaminate is observed at the start of the measurement.
Mayer et al. reported a larger value of CoF (0.3) for ALD Al2O3,19 although they used silicon
substrate and Si3N3 counterface ball, so the
results are not directly comparable.
Mohseni et al. obtained more similar CoF (0.15–0.22) for ALD
nanolaminate,20 although their investigations
focused on different nanolaminates (ZnO/Al2O3/ZrO2) and their tests used pin-on-disk configuration.
In the research reported here, the ALD nanolaminate was worn off after
200 ± 100 wear cycles (using 10 N force; 0.2 m/s linear speed;
6 mm diameter alumina ball). After this, the CoF increased rapidly,
until it stabilized to CoF value of nonoxidized PVD CrN coating. Huang
et al. reported similar rapid increase in CoF, followed by stabilization
to a value above 0.6 with identical loads and similar sliding speed
for PVD CrN.21

In addition to the
CoF value change, the typical colors caused
by Al2O3/TiO2 thin films could not
be seen after the wear steps even though the thin films are known
to be observable by eye still in 10 nm range. The removal of the ALD
nanolaminate was further confirmed with EDS analysis, which did not
show the characteristic Ti Kα peak at 4.5 keV obtained from
TiO2 in the nanolaminate.10 The
ALD nanolaminate was also not observed on the PVD CrN surface in FIB/SEM
cross-sectional images.

2.5 Wear Mechanism Schematic
on Corrosion-Protecting
Hybrid PVD/ALD Coatings
It was shown that removal of the
ALD nanolaminate from the top surface of the CrN coating reduced the
corrosion protection of the hybrid PVD/ALD coatings. Despite this,
the corrosion protection was superior to that of the corresponding
PVD CrN coating alone. Figure 12 shows the schematic of the effect of wear on the structure
and the corrosion protection obtained by hybrid PVD/ALD coatings.
This schematic has been constructed on the basis of the LSV results
and the SEM images in this work as well as some relevant previously
reported research: a simplified pinhole sealing schematic proposed
by Härkönen et al.,4 previous
FIB/SEM images showing ALD nanolaminate covering the bottom of PVD
CrN pinholes,4,10 and defect-type investigations
on PVD nitride coatings by Panjan et al.22,23

Figure 12 (a) Schematic of corrosion protection by hybrid PVD/ALD coatings.
Defects shown are based on various defects observed in FIB investigations
by Panjan et al.: open voids, closed pinholes, large (>1 μm)
flakelike defects, cone-shaped submicron defects.22 (b) Surface wear of the coating opens closed pinholes and
can open cracks through coating and creating paths for the corrosion
to attack the substrate.

Figure 12a shows
the structure of the hybrid PVD/ALD coatings. This structure offers
corrosion protection that is mostly unaffected by surface wear. Even
with surface wear removing all ALD coating and some PVD CrN from top
of the structure (Figure 12b), the pinholes remain sealed by ALD, and corrosion protection
largely remains. Some of the corrosion protection is, however, lost
due to four factors: (i) some of the defects in PVD coatings are closed
during the PVD deposition process.22 These
pinholes, which are not sealed by ALD, can be opened when the surface
of the PVD coating is worn. (ii) Particles on steel–PVD CrN
interface can be removed by wear, thus revealing areas that are uncovered
by ALD. (iii) Wear can cause crack propagation through the whole PVD
coating,18 opening up new paths to the
steel substrate. (iv) Some of the ALD coverage at pinholes can be
potentially lost, if ALD film adhesion is poor due to unfavorable
precursor-surface reactions. Regarding the fourth factor, plasma pretreatment
has been reported critical to obtain sufficient adhesion and enhanced
corrosion protection on PVD CrN and steel surfaces.5,10

3 Conclusions
The corrosion current density
of high-speed steel was reduced by
more than 2 orders of magnitude with hybrid PVD/ALD coating. Increase
in corrosion current density and amount of rust in sample surface
was only observed after all of the ALD nanolaminate and 100–200
nm of the top of the PVD CrN coating were removed by sandpaper grinding.
Even with complete removal of the ALD nanolaminate from the top, the
corrosion current density was less than half of that with the PVD
CrN coating without surface wear.

After all of the wear steps
and LSV measurements, the area fraction
of rust to the total salt solution contact area was 4% for the PVD
CrN-coated HSS and less than 2% for the hybrid PVD/ALD-coated HSS.
SEM analysis showed that for the hybrid PVD/ALD-protected HSS the
rust spots were located almost exclusively on areas with heavy wear
from repeated wear steps.

FIB/SEM cross-sectional images showed
that ALD nanolaminate is
present at defects even after the wear procedure, but corrosion had
progressed underneath the PVD CrN coating. Defects on steel surface
can result in cracks in the PVD CrN. These cracks can expand when
the surface is worn, exposing areas not covered by ALD. Surface wear-induced
cracks in the PVD CrN can act as channels for the corrosion to attack
through and can cause local collapse of the PVD CrN when the surface
was further worn. Thus, some of the corrosion protection by hybrid
PVD/ALD coating is lost, even if the sealing of the PVD CrN pinholes
is perfectly successful.

4 Experimental Methods
4.1 Materials
Highly alloyed high-speed
steel (HSS) disks were used as substrates: the details can be found
in the previous publication of the authors.10 In addition, (100) silicon die were employed as reference samples
to confirm expected ALD thickness and density.10 Approximately 3 μm of commercial BALINIT CNI CrN
coating (Oerlikon Balzers) was deposited by sputtering on top of the
HSS disks. The surface roughness of the PVD CrN coating was approximately
85 nm root-mean-square.

Nominally 100 nm thick Al2O3/TiO2 ALD nanolaminate was deposited on these
CrN-coated steel disks with Picosun R-200 Advanced system. The deposition
was done as reported previously,10 using
trimethylaluminum/H2O and TiCl4/H2O precursors for the two laminates consisting of alternating, 5 nm
thick layers. Prior to the ALD process, an oxygen plasma pretreatment
was used, as it has been shown to improve adhesion and obtain corrosion
protection of the nanolaminate.10

Noncoated steel disks, PVD CrN-coated steel disks, and hybrid PVD/ALD-coated
steel disks were used in this investigation. The effect of wear on
corrosion protection of these samples was evaluated by alternating
test sets between electrochemical LSV measurements in salt solution
(0.2 M NaCl) and the wear of the surface.

4.2 Electrochemical
Measurements
The
LSV measurements were conducted with a traditional three-electrode
setup, as reported previously,10 except
the test was modified as follows: Viton O-Ring limited contact area
was approximately 180 mm2, a 30 min waiting period was
used before scanning the voltage from −1.5 to 0.0 V, and the
samples remained in contact to the salt solution for approximately
2.5 h before taken out and cleaned by 5 min ultrasonication in ethanol.
The 0.25 mm pit at the middle of the disk was covered by lacquer (Duran
Schott, Germany) to eliminate its detrimental effect on corrosion
protection,10 reducing the effective corrosion
contact area to 170 mm2. Tafel analysis for the determination
of corrosion potentials and corrosion current densities from polarization
curves was conducted as per guidelines described in standard ASTM
G59-97.24 A total of five LSV measurements
were conducted in this manner, for an approximate total 13 h in salt
solution. A secondary sample set without any surface wear, but identical
amount of LSV measurements and time in salt solution, was conducted
to evaluate the effect of wear on the electrochemical properties measured
by LSV. Three of each sample type were used in all tests, and the
mean of standard deviation was used as measurement error.

4.3 Surface Wear
Between each of the
five LSV measurements, the surface of the disks was worn. A high-temperature
Anton Paar THT tribometer was used for the first three wear steps.
The tests were carried out on ball-on-disk configuration with 6 mm
diameter alumina balls (Anton Paar), 10 N load, and 0.2 m/s linear
speed. These tests were conducted under controlled environmental conditions
of temperature 23 °C and humidity 50%. The first two runs used
25 m total distance, and the third run used 50 m total distance. In
each of these runs, three circular ball-on-disk tests were conducted
for each disk, with radii of 2.5, 3.5, and 4.5 mm. The samples were
manually positioned in each wear run. A Dektak profilometer was used
to estimate the depth of the wear tracks and rust spots observed after
the final ball-on-disk step. Profilometer analysis of ball-on-disk
wear tracks was done for the PVD CrN-coated samples, using six measurements,
with standard deviation as error.

The fourth wear step was conducted
by sandpaper grinding: the top surface was ground away with 1200 grit
sandpaper for 15 s, a time chosen to ensure complete removal of ALD
from the top, as ALD coating was observed to be removed already after
a few seconds. An approximate amount of PVD CrN surface wear by sandpaper
grinding was indirectly estimated on the basis of wear track depths
measured by the Dektak profilometer, using optical microscopy to evaluate
which wear tracks (with previously measured depths) were removed by
the sandpaper grinding.

4.4 Coefficient of Friction
Measurement
The main purpose of the ball-on-disk tests was
to wear the surface
of the coated disks. In addition, the coefficient of friction (CoF)
was measured for the PVD CrN and the hybrid PVD/ALD coating to evaluate
the progression of the wear and the required amount of cycles to wear
the ALD away from the wear track. The CoF and time to wear for ALD
nanolaminate were measured with a time period starting from 2 s after
the measurement began and ending when friction was observed to increase
due to a contact to the PVD coating. The CoF development of the hybrid
PVD/ALD coating was compared to that of the CrN coating only. The
CoF measurements were repeated three times, with different samples,
and standard deviation was used as the measurement error.

4.5 Microscopy
All samples with wear
steps were examined and imaged by an optical microscope after each
LSV measurement and each wear step. The PVD CrN-coated and the hybrid
PVD/ALD-coated steel disks were analyzed in more detail with SEM and
EDS (Tescan Mira3; 13.0 kV acceleration voltage) after two final wear
steps (LSV4-Wear3 and LSV5-Wear4). The presence and removal of ALD
Al2O3/TiO2 nanolaminate was confirmed
using EDS Ti Kα peak at 4.5 keV, as described in a previous
publication.10 The amount of rust spots
and their position on the sample surface was evaluated with SEM and
EDS. Image-processing software ImageJ (version 1.51 k; U.S. National
Institutes of Health) was used to adjust contrast and calculate area
fraction of rust spots to the total effective corrosion contact area.

The hybrid PVD/ALD-coated samples were investigated by FIB/SEM
after the whole test procedure (LSV5-Wear4). FIB-milled cross sections
were studied by SEM at two types of position: major defects at wear
track and defects observed outside the wear tracks.

The cross-sectional
samples were prepared by FEI Helios NanoLab
600 FIB dual-beam system using 30 kV acceleration voltage rough milling,
with 6.5 and 2.7 nA currents. Fine milling was conducted with 0.44
nA. The working distance during the operation was 4.1 mm. Rough milling
was carried out at an angle of 52° from the substrate holder
surface normal to avoid a curtaining effect and hence some visible
diagonal artifacts manifested on some images.
