Nonenzyme
direct electrochemical
sensing of hydrogen peroxide and glucose by highly active nanomaterial-modified
electrode has attracted considerable attention. Among the reported
electrochemical sensing materials, hollow carbon sphere (HCS) is an
attractive carbon support because of its large specific surface area,
porous structure, and easy accessibility for target molecules. In
this study, naked Pt nanoparticles with average size of 3.13 nm are
confined in mesoporous shells of hollow carbon spheres (Pt/HCS) by
using one-step synthesis, which can not only produce highly dispersed
Pt nanoparticles with clean surface, but also avoid the relatively
slow impregnation–reduction process. The surface area of the
obtained Pt/HCS (566.30 m2 g–1) is larger
than that of HCS, attributing to the enlarged surface area after Pt
nanoparticles deposition. The average pore width of Pt/HCS (3.33 nm)
is smaller than that of HCS (3.84 nm), indicating the filling of Pt
nanoparticles in the mesopores of carbon shells. By using the as-synthesized
Pt/HCS as nonenzymatic sensing material, H2O2 and glucose can be detected with high sensitivity and selectivity.
The linear range toward H2O2 sensing is from
0.3 to 2338 μM, and the limit of detection (LOD) is 0.1 μM.
For glucose sensing, Pt/HCS exhibited two linear ranges from 0.3 to
10 mM and from 10 to 50 mM with an LOD of 0.1 mM. In addition, the
Pt/HCS exhibited higher electrochemical stability than commercial
Pt/C in acid solution. The present study demonstrates that Pt/HCS
is a promising sensing material for electrochemical detection of both
H2O2 and glucose.

1 Introduction
According to the report from the World Health Organization in 2016,
about 422 million people in the world are suffering from diabetes,
a chronic disease because of abnormal levels of blood glucose.1 Therefore, it is necessary to monitor the glucose
concentration in blood for the therapy of diabetes and researchers
are in the pursuit of creating glucose sensors with high sensitivity,
speediness, high reliability, and low cost. In addition, as an important
chemical and analyte, H2O2 has been applied
in various industry fields (e.g., mining, pharmaceutical industry,
environment, and textile and food manufacturing),2−4 biological diagnostics
fields (H2O2 is an indicator of Parkinson’s
disease, cancer, stroke, arteriosclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease,
etc.),5,6 and liquid-based fuel cells (H2O2 serves as an efficient oxidant).7 Among the developed diverse analytical techniques for the
detection of H2O2 and glucose (fluorescence,8 colorimetric,9 chemiluminescence,10,11 high-performance liquid chromatography12), enzyme- and nonenzyme-based electrochemical methods are attractive
due to their easy operation, high detection sensitivity and selectivity,
etc. Enzyme-based sensors are easy to be inactive and difficult to
recycle on account of being sensitive to temperature and humidity.
In recent years, to achieve high-performance sensing, to increase
the stability, and to lower the cost of electrochemical sensors, increasing
attention has been concentrated on nonenzymatic sensing nanomaterials.

Platinum (Pt) nanoparticles have been widely used as sensing materials
in nonenzymatic electrochemical hydrogen peroxide or glucose sensors
due to their excellent electronic and catalytic properties for the
oxidation of glucose and reduction of H2O2.13−15 Although Pt nanoparticles possess high electrocatalytic activity,
their poor durability and easiness of aggregation largely restrict
their practical application in electrochemical sensors. Hence, a lot
of studies have focused on dispersing Pt nanoparticles on support
materials, such as but not limited to graphene,16−18 porous carbon,19−21 metal organic framework,22 UiO-66,23 carbon nanotube,24,25 MCM-22,26 mesoporous carbon sphere,27,28 and hollow carbon sphere (HCS).29−31 Graphene-based and UiO-66-based
Pt nanoparticles have been applied in the fabrication of electrochemical
sensors for the sensitive detection of hydrogen peroxide18,23 and glucose.16,17 On the other hand, as a kind
of promising carbon support material, hollow carbon sphere (HCS) has
attracted increasing attention due to its high surface area for dispersing
metal nanoparticles, hollow interior structure and porous carbon shell
to provide abundant mass transport channels and confine nanoparticles
in the pores, high mechanical and chemical stability to resist acidic
and alkali corrosion, excellent biocompatibility to carry drug molecules,
and good electrical conductivity.32−36 It should be noted that at present most studies concerning
Pt nanoparticles supported on hollow carbon spheres focus on the electrocatalytic
performances for oxygen reduction reaction,28,29 methanol oxidation reaction,27 and supercapacitors.37 In the previous studies, it was found that by
confining Pt nanoparticles in porous carbon structure29,30 or ordered mesoporous carbon spheres,27,38 the electrochemical
stability and long-term catalytic performance of Pt nanoparticles
can be improved remarkably. For electrochemical sensors, Luhana et
al.31 reported a novel enzymatic glucose
sensor by depositing Pt nanoparticles-decorated hollow carbon spheres
on glassy carbon (GC) electrode (GCE) immobilized with glucose oxidase.
However, there is relatively few research on studying the H2O2- and glucose-sensing performances of Pt nanoparticles
confined in hollow carbon spheres without glucose oxidase.

Herein,
small and surface-clean Pt nanoparticles confined in mesoporous
shells of hollow carbon spheres (Pt/HCS) were prepared in a one-pot
synthesis by adding Pt precursor into the HCS synthesis system. HCS
acts as a porous template to provide mesopores for confinement of
Pt nanoparticles with controlled size and to prevent the aggregation
of Pt nanoparticles. The Pt nanoparticles confined in HCS can not
only provide active surface and increase the surface area, but also
enhance the conductivity of the material. The synthesized Pt/HCS showed
high sensing performances for nonenzymatic electrochemical detection
of hydrogen peroxide and glucose due to the high catalytic activity
and stability of the highly dispersed Pt nanoparticles. The electrochemical
sensor fabricated from the Pt/HCS exhibited potential application
in real samples.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Characterization of Pt Nanoparticles
Confined in Mesoporous Shells of Hollow Carbon Spheres (Pt/HCSs)
In this study, mesoporous carbon structure was chosen to confine
Pt nanoparticles owing to the following advantages. First, the mesoporous
carbon allows the formation of nanoparticle catalyst during the calcination
process at high temperature. Second, the carbon channels can prevent
the sintering of the formed Pt nanoparticles and the final size of
Pt nanoparticles can be automatically controlled by the dimension
of the mesoporous channels. Third, the porous structure ensures a
good spatial distribution of Pt nanoparticles.39,40 Fourth, by depositing Pt nanoparticles in porous carbon matrix,
the high electronic conductivity of carbon is beneficial for the application
of Pt/HCS as electrocatalyst in electrochemical sensors. It should
be noted that metal nanoparticles confined in mesoporous structures
are usually prepared by the impregnation–reduction–annealing
method.19−21,27,37,39,40 In the reported method, metal ions were introduced first in the
pores of the mesoporous structure through the incipient wetness impregnation.
The metal ions were then reduced to metal clusters under reduction
condition and finally transformed into metal nanoparticles through
the annealing treatment. This multistep synthesis method is experimentally
complicated and difficult to control the structure of product. In
the present study, one-step process was used to prepare Pt/HCS by
introducing Pt precursor in the formation process of HCS. Meanwhile,
on the basis of the previous study,30 H2PtCl6 precursor can also initiate the polymerization
of furfuryl alcohol. Therefore, H2PtCl6 can
not only serve as the Pt precursor, but also initiate the polymerization
of resorcinol and formaldehyde for the preparation of carbon spheres.
On the surface of SiO2 spheres obtained by the hydrolysis
of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), H2PtCl6 is surrounded
by the polymerized phenolic resin, which serves as a protecting agent
to prevent the agglomeration of Pt nanoparticles in the subsequent
carbonization process. With the present method, highly dispersed Pt
nanoparticles confined in HCS can be easily prepared.

The synthesis
process of Pt/HCS is schematically illustrated in Scheme 1. As described in Experimental Section, SiO2 spheres were
first obtained by the hydrolysis of TEOS. Pt ions can be self-assembled
into the phenolic resin molecular after resorcinol, formaldehyde,
and K2PtCl4 were added in the reaction system.
Pt/HCS can be finally prepared through the thermal annealing process
at 800 °C and the removal of internal SiO2 sphere
template. The obtained Pt nanoparticles are confined in the mesoporous
carbon shell, and the mesopores of HCS can restrict the movement and
shedding of Pt nanoparticles to improve their stability.

Scheme 1 Schematic
Illustration of the Formation Process of Pt/HCS
Figure 1A shows
the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of HCS. It can be
seen that monodispersed HCS with a smooth surface and an average diameter
of about 140 nm can be synthesized without the presence of Pt precursor.
The nitrogen adsorption–desorption curve of HCS in Figure 1C shows a typical
IV type isotherm, indicating that HCS has mesoporous structure. The
HCS material was measured to have a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area of 391.23 m2 g–1 and
an average pore width (by BET) of 3.84 nm. Figure 1B displays the TEM image of Pt/HCS. Compared
to the structure of HCS shown in Figure 1A, the diameter of Pt/HCS has no obvious
change, but small Pt nanoparticles distributed inside the shell of
HCS can be seen clearly. Such result indicates that with the addition
of H2PtCl6 during the synthesis of HCS, Pt nanoparticles
can be in situ produced in the carbon mesopores. Meanwhile, it is
interesting that the BET surface area of Pt/HCS increases to 566.30
m2 g–1, as shown in Figure 1D, and the adsorption average
pore width (by BET) decreases to 3.33 nm. On the basis of the increased
BET surface area and the reduced pore width of Pt/HCS compared to
HCS, it can be speculated that the formed Pt nanoparticles are confined
in the mesoporous shell of HCS. The confined Pt nanoparticles could
enlarge the surface area of Pt/HCS and occupy parts of the carbon
mesopores to some extent. In addition, on the basis of the size-distribution
histogram shown in the inset of Figure 2B, the mean size of Pt nanoparticles is 3.13 nm, which
is smaller than the pore size of HCS (3.84 nm).

and Pt (H). The inset in B shows the size-distribution histogram of
Pt nanoparticles in Pt/HCS.

The crystal phases of the prepared materials were characterized
by XRD. Figure 1E shows
the XRD patterns of HCS and Pt/HCS. The broad peaks at 2θ of
25° in both XRD spectra correspond to the (002) plane of carbon.
Compared to that of HCS, the XRD pattern of Pt/HCS shows additional
sharp diffraction peaks at 2θ of 39.75, 46.23, 67.45, 81.24,
and 85.69°, corresponding to the (111), (200), (220), (311),
and (222) facets of Pt (JCPDS 65-2868). Meanwhile, according to the
Scherrer equation, the size of Pt nanoparticles was calculated to
be 3.9 nm based on the (111) peak, which is close to that obtained
from TEM measurement. Figure 1F shows the UV–vis absorption spectra of Pt/HCS and
HCS in water. The absorption curves of both HCS and Pt/HCS show an
exponential decay profile. It is noteworthy that Pt nanoparticles
do not exhibit detectable localized surface plasmon resonance band,41 suggesting that the Pt nanoparticles has small
size and they could be confined in the mesoporous shell of HCS.

Figure 2A–D
shows the HRTEM images of Pt/HCS at different magnifications. It can
be observed that Pt nanoparticles with an average size of 3.13 nm
(Figure 2B inset) are
evenly dispersed in HCS. From the HRTEM image in Figure 2D, the interplanar distance
of 0.226 nm matches well with the (111) lattice plane of Pt crystal.
High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy
(HAADF-STEM) image (Figure 2E) and the corresponding elemental mappings of C, O, and Pt
(Figure 2F–H)
obviously indicate the uniform distribution of C, O, and Pt elements
in the carbon shell, which also suggests the successful confinement
of Pt nanoparticles in the shell of HCS.

X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed
to study the chemical composition and states of the Pt/HCS sensing
material. Figures 3A and S2A show the survey XPS images of
Pt/HCS and HCS, respectively. Compared to the survey spectrum of HCS,
the prominent signal at 73.0 eV in Figure 3A is from the Pt nanoparticles in Pt/HCS.
The high-resolution Pt 4f spectrum of Pt/HCS in Figure 3B exhibits two main single peaks at 71.0
and 74.3 eV, which can be assigned to Pt0 4f7/2 and Pt0 4f5/2, respectively, revealing the
metallic state of Pt nanoparticles.16,21 The C 1s XPS
images of Pt/HCS (Figure 3C) and HCS (Figure S2B) clearly
show the three main types of carbon: C–C (284.5 eV), C–O
(286.2 eV), and C=O (288.8 eV). On the other hand, it can be
seen that the peak of C–C in HCS (Figure S2B) is predominant and the peaks of C–O and C=O
are relatively weak. Compared to HCS, the peaks of C–O and
C=O are relatively stronger in Pt/HCS, which could be ascribed
to that Pt precursor in the reaction system accelerates the polymerization
of resorcinol and formaldehyde and thus introduces more oxygen-containing
functional groups.

Pt 4f (B)
and C 1s (C) of Pt/HCS.

Raman spectroscopy was then employed to study the amorphous
and
graphitic carbon contents in the HCS and Pt/HCS using the intensity
ratio of D-band to G-band (ID/IG).42Figure S3A shows the Raman spectra of HCS and
Pt/HCS, in which the two peaks at 1356 and 1596 cm–1 correspond to the disordered graphite (D-band) and graphite (G-band)
carbon. The ID/IG value of Pt/HCS (0.71) is close to that of the HCS (0.79),
indicating the similar defect level in the two samples. These results
reveal that the formed Pt nanoparticles confined in the mesoporous
shell of HCS do not change the degree of graphitization of carbon
shells, which is consistent with the results of TEM and BET.

2.2 Amperometric H2O2 Detection
Based on Pt/HCS-Modified Electrode
Electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy measurements were first carried out to investigate the
electrical conductivity of HCS- and Pt/HCS-modified electrodes. The
semicircle diameter in a typical Nyquist plot can reflect the charge-transfer
resistance (Rct) at the interface of electrode
and electrolyte. It is well known that a smaller semicircle means
a higher electron transfer rate of an interface and a higher electrical
conductivity of material. The Nyquist plots in Figure S3B clearly show that the semicircle diameter of Pt/HCS
is smaller than that of HCS, indicating that the introduction of Pt
nanoparticles can improve the conductivity of HCS.

The electrochemical
properties of Pt/HCS were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in acid
solution using commercial Pt/C as a reference material, as presented
in Figure 4A. Similar
to the commercial Pt/C, the CV curve of Pt/HCS shows the characteristic
voltammetric peaks of Pt and carbon, suggesting the clean surface
of Pt nanoparticles confined in the mesoporous carbon shell. It can
be seen that there are three pairs of characteristic peaks
for Pt/HCS: the Pt oxidation peak at 0.65 V, the reduction of Pt oxide
at 0.46 V in the reversed potential scan, and the adsorption and desorption
of hydrogen between −0.2 and 0 V. The corresponding reactions
can be described with the following equations 1   2   3  Meanwhile, a couple of redox
peaks at 0.39
and 0.24 V can be observed, which can be assigned to the redox of
oxygen-containing functional groups (carboxylic, carbonyls, and phenolic
hydroxyls) on the surface of HCS.30,43 Compared to
Pt/C, Pt/HCS shows larger double-layer charging current due to the
large surface area of carbon shells of hollow carbon spheres. As shown
in Figure S4A, similar characteristic CV
peaks can be observed for Pt/C and Pt/HCS in neutral phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS), but the peak potentials show a slight shift. The hydrogen
adsorption and desorption region moves to −0.5 to 0.3 V, the
Pt oxidation peak shifts to 0.56 V, and the reduction peak of Pt oxides
moves to around 0.0 V.

mV s–1. (B) CV curves of Pt/HCS-modified GC electrode
in
0.1 M PBS (pH = 7.4) solution with the absence and presence of 500
μM H2O2 at a scan rate of 50 mV s–1.

For Pt/HCS, at certain
potentials, the naked Pt nanoparticles can
provide active sites for the reduction of H2O2 and therefore produce amperometric signals according to the following
equation44,45 4  On the other hand, on the basis of the previous
studies,46,47 as an oxidant, H2O2 can react with the reactive carbon atoms on the surface of carbon
materials (e.g., reduced graphene oxide). Therefore, on the surface
of HCS, hydrogen peroxide could be also reduced to generate reduction
current. However, from the electrochemical results below, the HCS
shows much lower catalytic activity for the H2O2 reduction.

Figure 4B presents
the CV curves of Pt/HCS in 0.1 M PBS (pH = 7.4) solution with and
without 500 μM H2O2 at a potential scan
rate of 50 mV s–1. For Pt/HCS in 0.1 M PBS, two
small peaks at −0.06 and −0.36 V can be observed, corresponding
to the reduction of Pt oxide and defective sites of HCS.20,48 For comparison, the CV curve of HCS modified on GCE was also recorded
in 0.1 M PBS (pH = 7.4) solution, as shown in Figure S4B. One can see that the CV curve of HCS shows only
one reduction peak at about −0.32 V, which proves that the
peak at −0.36 V in Figure 4B comes from the hollow carbon spheres. As shown in Figure 4B, upon the addition
of 500 μM H2O2, the electrochemical reduction
currents show much increase. The enhanced electrochemical current
signals could be ascribed to the electrochemical reduction of H2O2 on the clean surface of Pt nanoparticles confined
in HCS.

The current–time (i–t) curves of H2O2 reduction on Pt/HCS
and HCS
(Figure 5A) demonstrate
that Pt/HCS exhibits much higher catalytic activity and higher sensing
sensitivity than HCS toward H2O2 detection. Figure 5B shows the typical i–t curve from Pt/HCS under successive
addition of H2O2 in 0.1 M N2-saturated
PBS solution. A ladderlike plot can be observed, which shows the current
response to the successive addition of H2O2.
When micromolar levels of H2O2 (as low as 0.3
μM shown in the inset of Figure 5B) are added in the system, obvious current responses
are discernible. However, as displayed in Figure S4C, only when the concentration of H2O2 is higher than 5 μM, obvious current responses can be observed
on the HCS, indicating the much higher sensing performance of Pt/HCS
for the H2O2 detection. Figure 5C shows the calibration curves of Pt/HCS
for the quantitative analysis of hydrogen peroxide. At the concentration
range of 0.3–2388 μM, the calibration equation can be
described as I (μA) = −0.0182C (μM) – 0.628 with a calibration coefficient
of 0.997. The limit of detection (LOD) was calculated to be 0.1 μM
based on a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 (S/N = 3), which is lower than
that from other Pt-based sensing materials, for example, Pt@UiO-66
(5 μM)23 and the Pt supported on
ordered mesoporous carbons (Pt/OMCs, 1.2 μM).20

M H2O2 and 0.1 M different interfering analytes

DA: dopamine; UA: uric acid.

The improved electrochemical sensing properties of Pt/HCS
could
be ascribed to the unique structure and synergistic effect of Pt and
HCS. On the one hand, as shown in the TEM images, the highly dispersed
Pt nanoparticles confined in the mesoporous carbon shells can provide
abundant Pt active sites for the reduction of H2O2 molecules. On the other hand, the mesopores in HCS can not only
prevent the agglomeration of Pt nanoparticles, but also provide channels
to enhance the mass transportation in electrochemical reactions. Moreover,
the interference effects of urea, ascorbic acid, dopamine, uric acid,
and metal ions toward the H2O2 determination
on Pt/HCS were also investigated (Figures 5D and S5). It
can be seen that an obvious staircase can be detected upon the addition
of H2O2, whereas negligible signals can be observed
upon the addition of the studied interference analytes. Therefore,
the Pt/HCS shows good anti-interference properties for the detection
of hydrogen peroxide.

2.3 Electrochemical Detection
of Glucose Based
on Pt/HCS-Modified Electrode
The electrocatalytic activity
of Pt/HCS for glucose oxidation was first evaluated by cyclic voltammetry
in 0.1 M PBS with the absence and presence of 50 mM glucose. As shown
in Figure 6A, CV features
of Pt can be observed for Pt/HCS in the electrolyte without glucose
(black line), including the hydrogen desorption and adsorption current
peaks at low-potential region (−0.6 to −0.3 V) and the
Pt oxide formation/reduction at high potentials.49,50 However, in the presence of 50 mM glucose in 0.1 M PBS, a much different
CV curve was obtained, suggesting the electrocatalytic activity of
Pt/HCS for the oxidation of glucose. In the CV curve, the first small
oxidation peak at −0.4 V during the positive scan may be attributed
to the electrochemical adsorption of glucose on the Pt/HCS.51 With the potential scanning, the adsorbed glucose
can be oxidized to gluconic acid and give the second oxidation current
peak at 0.04 V.49,52 With the further increase of
potential, the accumulation of glucose intermediates on the surface
of Pt/HCS reaches the highest limit value and inhibits the further
oxidation of glucose, leading to the decrease of current. When the
potential increases to 0.4 V, Pt–OH is formed, which can catalyze
the oxidation of glucose intermediates to form gluconolactone or gluconic
acid, resulting in the increase of current with a peak at 0.6 V.20,49 The decrease of current at higher potentials could be ascribed to
the formation of thick Pt oxide. On the other hand, during the negative
potential scan, more and more Pt active sites are liberated from the
reduction of Pt oxide and glucose starts oxidation at the potential
around 0.05 V, leading to the increase of oxidation current and the
appearance of the peak at around −0.05 V.

glucose. (D) The current response of Pt/HCS to the addition of 2 mM
glucose and 2 mM different interfering analytes (sucrose, lactose,
and maltose) in 0.1 M PBS solution (pH = 7.4) at 0.6 V.

Amperometric response of Pt/HCS to successive addition
of glucose
was then studied in 0.1 M PBS (pH = 7.4) at 0.6 V. Figure 6B displays the typical i–t curve of Pt/HCS for the oxidation
of glucose. The inset in Figure 6B shows the corresponding electrochemical response
to the glucose at low concentrations. On the basis of these i–t measurements, the corresponding
calibration curve for the detection of glucose can be obtained. As
displayed in Figure 6C, Pt/HCS has two linear responses to glucose concentration: one
is from 0.3 to 10 mM with the corresponding calibration equation of I (μA) = 0.187C (mM) + 0.495 (R2 = 0.996) and another one is from 10 to 50
mM with the corresponding calibration equation of I (μA) = 0.0697C (mM) + 1.345 (R2 = 0.987). It is well known that the physiological level
of glucose is from 3 to 8 mM, which is in the first linear detection
range, indicating the potential application of Pt/HCS in the practical
detection of glucose.17,53 The LOD of glucose was calculated
to be 0.1 mM based on a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 (S/N = 3). The
sensing selectivity of Pt/HCS for glucose was also studied by examining
the electrochemical response of Pt/HCS to other sugars. Figure 6D shows the amperometric responses
of Pt/HCS with successive addition of 2 mM glucose, 2 mM sucrose,
2 mM lactose, and 2 mM maltose. It can be seen that negligible current
response can be detected upon the injection of sucrose, lactose, and
maltose. Therefore, the present Pt/HCS has high sensing selectivity
for the electrochemical detection of glucose among these sugars.

The above electrochemical results sufficiently indicate that the
Pt nanoparticles confined in unique carbon mesoporous structure have
promising application for electrochemically sensing H2O2 and glucose with high sensitivity and selectivity.

The durability of Pt/HCS was studied by accelerated degradation
tests (ADTs) in 0.1 M HClO4 solution using commercial Pt/C
as a reference. The evolutions of CV curves from Pt/HCS and Pt/C over
5000 cycles of ADTs are shown in Figure S6A,B, respectively. By comparing the CVs in Figure S6A,B, obviously the current intensity from commercial Pt/C
shows rapider attenuation than from the Pt/HCS. As shown in Figure S6D, after 5000 potential cycles, the
peak current intensity of Pt/C at 0.5 V reduces by 75%. However, for
the Pt/HCS, the peak current shows unnoticeable change after 1000
cycles and maintains over 70% of the initial one after 5000 cycles.
These results strongly indicate that Pt/HCS has enhanced the electrochemical
durability in comparison to the Pt/C catalyst. In Pt/HCS, with Pt
nanoparticles confined in carbon mesopores, the porous structure of
HCS can not only prevent the agglomeration of Pt nanoparticles, but
also protect the Pt nanoparticles from corrosion to a certain extent.

2.4 Real Sample Analysis
The practical
application of Pt/HCS was evaluated by detecting the H2O2 and glucose in human blood serum sample. The serum
sample was first deoxygenated before adding in PBS solution to avoid
the interference of oxygen.

To figure out the concentration
of H2O2 in human blood serum, i–t curves of adding 100 μL of serum
sample and successively injecting 2 μL (0.1 M) of H2O2 standard solution in 10 mL of PBS (0.1 M, pH 7.4) at
−0.1 V are recorded in Figure 7A. The results calculated based on regression equation
in Figure 5C are shown
in Table 1. The high
recovery between 98.95 and 102.8% suggests the promising application
of the present Pt/HCS for H2O2 detection in
the blood serum. To detect the concentration of glucose in human blood
serum, i–t curves of adding
10 μL (1 M) of glucose standard solution (three times) and 50
μL of serum are recorded in Figure 7B. As shown in Table 2, recoveries higher than 98.2% were obtained.
Meanwhile, the glucose concentration calculated by this method is
5.6 mM, which is close to that measured by a glucometer in hospital
(5.7 mM), indicating that the electrochemical sensor is practically
useful for glucose detection.

3 Conclusions
In this study, surface-clean Pt nanoparticles
confined in porous
shell of hollow carbon spheres (Pt/HCSs) were successfully synthesized
by adding Pt precursor in the synthesis process of HCS and the Pt/HCS
showed high sensing performances for the electrochemical detection
of hydrogen peroxide and glucose. In this study, the mesoporous carbon
shell structure plays the following roles for improving the catalytic
and sensing properties of Pt/HCS. First, the mesoporous structure
serves as template to restrain the Pt nanoparticles size and prevent
the agglomeration of Pt nanoparticles in the calcination and electrochemical
sensing processes. Second, the large numbers of porous carbon channels
facilitate the entry of detected molecules (H2O2 and glucose) and are conducive to mass transfer in the electrochemical
sensing process. Third, by confining Pt nanoparticles in carbon matrix,
the obtained Pt/HCS has excellent electronic conductivity, which is
favorable for its application in electrochemical sensing. Fourth,
this unique structure can protect nanoparticles from corrosion to
some extent in the electrochemical environment. Due to the above structural
advantages and the highly active surface of naked Pt nanoparticles,
the prepared Pt/HCS exhibited a high sensing performance for H2O2 detection with a wide linearity between 0.3
and 2338 μM and a detection limit of 0.1 μM, and a high
sensing performance for glucose with linear ranges of 0.3–10
and 10–50 mM and a detection limit of 0.1 mM. In addition,
Pt/HCS has high sensing selectivity for both H2O2 and glucose detection. Moreover, the ADT experiments indicated that
Pt/HCS is more stable than commercial Pt/C in acid solution. The present
study shows that Pt/HCS is a potential candidate as an advanced electrochemical
sensing material or electrocatalyst for electrochemical analysis and
electrocatalysis applications.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemical Reagents and Materials
Potassium
tetrachloroplatinate(II) (K2PtCl4, 98%), tetraethoxysilane
(TEOS, ≥98%), and dopamine (DA) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
Resorcinol (≥99.5%), ammonia solution (25–28%), and
formaldehyde solution (37.0–40.0%) were purchased from Sinopharm
Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Anhydrous ethanol (≥99.7%), sodium
dihydrogen phosphate dehydrate (NaH2PO4·2H2O, >99.0%), sodium phosphate dibasic dodecahydrate (Na2HPO4·12H2O, >99.0%), hydrogen
peroxide
(H2O2, AR grade, 30%), glucose (C6H12O6·H2O, AR grade), urea
(CO(NH2)2, AR grade), and ascorbic acid (AA,
C6H8O6, AR grade) were provided by
Beijing Chemical Works. Uric acid (UA, C5H4N4O3, AR grade) was obtained from Wokai Chemical
Limited (China). Hydrofluoric acid (HF, ≥40%) was acquired
from Shen Yang Hua Dong Chemical Works. Perfluorosulfonic acid–poly(tetrafluoroethylene)
copolymer (Nafion, 5% w/w solution) was obtained from Alfa Aesar.
Perchloric acid (HClO4, AR grade) was supplied by Tianjin
Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Commercial Pt/C (20 wt % of 2–5
nm Pt nanoparticles on Vulcan XC-72R carbon support) used in this
study was obtained from Alfa Aesar. The water used in the experiments
was prepared by a Nanopure water system (18.3 MΩ cm). Human
blood serum was obtained from Affiliated Hospital of Northeast Normal
University in Changchun, China. Different concentrations of H2O2 solutions were freshly prepared when needed.
All of the chemicals in experiments were used without any further
purification.

4.2 Synthesis of Pt Nanoparticles
Confined in
Mesoporous Pores of Hollow Carbon Spheres (Pt/HCS)
Pt/HCS
was synthesized from K2PtCl4 and phenolic resin
by a modified Stöber method. Typically, TEOS (0.4 mL) dispersed
in 30 mL ethanol was dropped into the solution containing 20 mL of
ethanol, 6 mL of water, and 2 mL of ammonia solution in a round-bottom
flask. After stirring for 1 h at room temperature, the solution color
changed gradually to slight milky white. Then, 0.1 g of resorcinol,
0.14 mL of formaldehyde solution, and 2 mL of K2PtCl4 solution (20 mM) were separately added into the reaction
solution. After stirring for 24 h at room temperature, the resulting
product was collected by centrifugation and washed with deionized
water and anhydrous ethanol several times. The obtained product was
dried in an oven at 60 °C for several hours. The dried powder
product was transferred into a ceramic boat and placed in a tubular
furnace to calcinate at 800 °C for 1 h at a heating rate of 5
°C min–1. The black product was stirred in
HF solution for 24 h to etch the SiO2 template. The product
was precipitated by centrifugation, washed with water and ethanol
several times, and dried in an oven at 60 °C for several hours.

For comparison, HCS was also synthesized by the same method without
the addition of Pt precursor solution.

4.3 Material
Characterizations
Morphologies
of the samples were characterized by a Hitachi H-600 transmission
electron microscope operated at 100 kV. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM),
high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy
(HAAD-STEM), corresponding elements mapping, and energy-dispersive
X-ray measurements were all conducted on a JEM-2010 (HR) microscope
with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD)
patterns were collected on a D8 ADVAVCE powder diffractometer (Brukey
Company) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm at 30 kV,
15 mA). UV–vis measurements were performed on a UV-3000PC spectrophotometer
purchased from Shanghai Mapada Instruments Co., Ltd. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out using a VG Thermo ESCALAB 250 spectrometer
operated at 120 W. The Barrett–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface
area, nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms, and pore size-distribution
curves were acquired on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 V 4.0 system at
the analysis bath temperature of −196.012 °C and the equilibration
interval of 10 s.

4.4 Electrochemical Sensing
Measurements
All electrochemical tests were carried out on
a CHI 660D electrochemical
workstation with a standard three-electrode system at room temperature.
A commercial glassy carbon electrode (GCE) (Tianjin Aidahengsheng
Science-Technology Development Co., Ltd., 3.0 mm in diameter) modified
with the prepared catalyst material, a Pt coil, and an Ag/AgCl (KCl-saturated)
electrode were used as working, counter, and reference electrodes,
respectively. Before use, the GCE was polished with alumina slurry
to obtain a clean mirror surface. Before preparing working electrode,
the catalyst ink was prepared by dispersing 2 mg of Pt/HCS in 0.8
mL of deionized water and 0.2 mL of ethanol under magnetic stirring.
Then, 10 μL (2 mg mL–1) of catalyst ink and
2.5 μL of Nafion (5‰ w/w solution) was dropped onto the
prepolished GCE by a pipette and dried at room temperature.

The electrolyte used in the electrochemical experiments was prepared
by dissolving 0.57 g of NaH2PO4·12H2O and 2.87 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O in 250 mL of ultrapure water to obtain 0.1 M (PH = 7.4)
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature. Cyclic voltammogram
(CV) measurements were performed in the potential range of −0.6
to 1.0 V in N2-saturated PBS solution. Amperometric i–t curves were recorded in N2-saturated PBS solution under stirring. All of the i–t measurements were conducted
three times.

4.5 Electrochemical Stability
of Pt/HCS in Acid
Solution
The electrochemical stabilities of Pt/HCS and commercial
Pt/C were examined by accelerated degradation tests (ADTs), in which
5000 cyclic potential sweeps were conducted in a 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte in the potential range of −0.25 to 1.0 V (vs
Ag/AgCl) at a scan rate of 100 mV s–1. For preparing
the working electrode, 20 μL of catalyst inks (2 mg mL–1) and 5 μL of Nafion (5‰ w/w solution) were modified
on a GCE (5 mm in diameter) at room temperature.
