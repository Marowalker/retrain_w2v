Introduction
Organophosphorus compounds
are an important class of organic compounds,
exclusively applicable in organic synthesis,1 material sciences,2 medicinal chemistry,3 agro industry,4 and
coordination chemistry.5 The chemical and
physical properties of parent molecules are changed by the incorporation
of the phosphate group. Many P-containing heterocycles show excellent
biological activities.6 Moreover, phosphonate
esters are frequently used as prodrugs in the pharmaceutical industry.7 Therefore, development of newer methodologies
for introducing the phosphonate esters into organic molecules is highly
demanding in organic synthesis. First, in 1980 Hirao and coworkers
described palladium-catalyzed phosphorylation of aryl iodides or bromides.8 After that, many cross-coupling reactions between
aryl (pseudo)halides, aryltriflates, tosylates, boronic acids, aryl
diazonium salts, alkenyl/alkynyl carboxyl acids, or nucleophilic heteroarenes
and H-phosphonates or H-phosphine
oxides have been developed using transition-metal catalysts.9 However, recently direct oxidative C–H
phosphorylation using transition-metal-catalyst has drawn much attention
to the organic synthetic chemist.

Indazole, a N-containing heterocyclic
compound, acts as efficient
bioisosteres of indole and benzimidazole in pharmaceutical chemistry.10 It has gained considerable attention in pharmaceuticals
due to their broad range of biological activities11 like antitumor,11a antimicrobial,11b antiinflammatory,11c antidepressant,11d anti platelet,11e anticancer,11f and
HIV-protease inhibition.11g Indazoles are
used as estrogen receptors, bacterial gyrase β-inhibitors11h and also have potential activity towards the
imidazoline I2-receptor and 5-HT1A receptors. It is the
core structure of many drug molecules12 such as MK-4827 (anticancer agent), pazopanib, bendazac (votrient,
tyrosine kinase inhibitor), and gamendazole (Figure 1). Owing to their high biological activities,
various methodologies have been made for the synthesis13 and functionalization14 of indazoles. Our group was also actively involved for functionalization
of 2H-indazoles.15 Very
recently, our group reported phosphorylation of 2H-indazole with diphenylphosphine oxide via visible light photoredox
catalysis.15b But in our previous conditions15b phosphonate ester did not react with 2H-indazole. It is worthy to mention that Mn(III) acetate
is found to be an effective catalyst for various C–H functionalization.16,17 Considering the high importance of both phosphonate esters and indazole
moiety, herein we describe a direct C–H phosphorylation of
2H-indazole with dialkyl phosphites using manganese(III)
acetate at 80 °C (Scheme 1).

molecules.

Scheme 1 Phosphorylation of Indazoles
Results and Discussion
To optimize the phosphorylation of 2H-indazole,
we commenced our study by taking 2H-indazole (1a) and diethyl phosphite (2a) as model substrates.
At first, the reaction was carried out using 2 equiv Mn(OAc)3·2H2O in CH3CN at 80 °C. Interestingly,
diethyl (2-phenyl-2H-indazol-3-yl)phosphonate (3aa) was formed in 52% yield after 10 h (Table 1, entry 1). The yield of the
reaction did not improve even after 12 h. Encouraged by this initial
result, the reaction was carried out under different conditions to
optimize the reaction and the results are summarized in Table 1. Initially, we checked the
solvent effect taking other different solvents like AcOH, EtOH, NMP,
1,2-DCE, and DMF (Table 1, entries 2–6). Better results were obtained in AcOH providing
the desired phosphorylated product in 88% yield (Table 1, entry 2). The yield was dropped
to 41% with diminishing the amount of Mn(III) acetate (1 equiv) but
no improvement of yield was observed with the increase in load of
Mn(III) acetate (3 equiv) as well as diethyl phosphite (3 equiv) (Table 1, entries 7 and 8).
The reaction yield did not increase significantly at 100 °C but
the yield was diminished to 58% with lowering the reaction temperature
(60 °C) (Table 1 entries 9 and 10). Mn(II) acetate is not suitable for such transformation
(Table 1, entry 11).
Moreover the reaction did not proceed in the absence of Mn(III) acetate
(Table 1, entry 12).
Other catalysts like Cu(acac)2, MnO2, CuI, and
Fe(acac)3 were unable to produce the desired product (Table 1, entries 13–16).
Finally, we got the optimized reaction conditions using 2 equiv Mn(OAc)3·2H2O and 2 equiv diethyl phosphite in AcOH
at 80 °C for 10 h (Table 1, entry 2).

After optimizing the reaction conditions, we explored the substrate
scope to study the generality of this protocol (Scheme 2). A series of phosphorylated 2H-indaozoles were synthesized in moderate to good yields under the
present reaction conditions. First, we examined the effect of the
different N-2 substituents on 2H-indazoles. Electron-donating
groups like −Me and −OMe substituted 2H-indazoles reacted very smoothly under optimized reaction conditions
(3ba–3ea). Halogen substituted 2-phenyl-2H-indazoles also produced the phosphorylated product in
good yields (3fa–3ja). In addition,
2-(naphthalen-1-yl)-2H-indazole also worked well
(3ka). However, ortho-substituted 2-phenyl-2H-indazoles, N-alkyl, and N-benzyl
substituted 2-H-indazole were not suitable for this
reaction. Moreover, 1H-indazole and unprotected 2H-indazole remained unreactive towards the phosphorylation
reaction. In addition, 1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-amine and 1H-pyrazole did not respond
in this reaction. Furthermore, the gram-scale reaction was carried
out under the normal laboratory set up using 2-phenyl-2H-indazole (1a, 5 mmol) and diethyl phosphite (2a, 10 mmol) under the standard reaction conditions. Delightfully,
the reaction offered the corresponding product (3aa)
with comparable yield (82%) which clearly elucidates the practical
applicability of this present methodology.

Scheme 2 Substrate Scope
Reaction conditions: 1 (0.2 mmol), Mn(OAc)3·2H2O (2 equiv),
diethyl phosphite (2a, 2 equiv), and AcOH (2 mL) for
10 h at 80 °C.

On a
5 mmol scale.

Next, we checked the effect
of different substituents at the arene
part of 2H-indazoles (Scheme 3). Halogen (−F and −Cl) containing
substrates efficiently reacted with diethyl phosphite to produce the
desired products in good yields (3la–3na). 5-Methoxy-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2H-indazole and
diethyl 5-methoxy-2-(p-tolyl)-2H-indazole also reacted effectively under the optimized reaction conditions
to form the desired products in good yields (3oa and 3pa).

Scheme 3 Substrate Scope of Indazole
Reaction
conditions: 1 (0.2 mmol), Mn(OAc)3·2H2O (2 equiv),
diethyl phosphite (2a, 2 equiv), and AcOH (2 mL) for
10 h at 80 °C.

With the optimized conditions,
the scope of this protocol was also
extended with different phosphorylating agents (Scheme 4). Dimethyl phosphite and diisopropyl phosphite
effectively reacted with differently substituted 2H-indazoles to provide the phosphorylated products in moderate to
good yields (3ab, 3bb, 3bc,
and 3mc). But diphenyl phosphite, dibenzyl phosphite,
diphenylphosphine oxide, and triethyl phosphite were unable to produce
the desired products.

Scheme 4 Substrate Scope of Phosphonate Ester
Reaction conditions: 1 (0.2 mmol), Mn(OAc)3·2H2O (2 equiv),
dialkyl phosphite (2, 2 equiv), and AcOH (2 mL) for 10
h at 80 °C.

Finally, radical trapping
experiments were conducted to probe the
mechanistic pathway of this reaction. The present phosphorylation
reaction is completely suppressed with the addition of radical scavengers
like, 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methyl phenol, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl,
and p-benzoquinone. These results suggest a radical
mechanism of the present reaction Scheme 5.

Scheme 5 Radical Trapping Experiments
In accordance with the control experimental
results and previous
literature reports,17 we proposed a plausible
mechanism of phosphorylation reaction in Scheme 6. At first, phosphoryl radical (A) is formed by Mn(III) acetate. Then, addition of the phosphoryl
radical A at the C-3 position of 2H-indazole
(1a) provides the intermediate B. The elimination
of the hydrogen radical from intermediate B gives the
desired C–H phosphorylated product 3aa.

Scheme 6 Probable
Mechanism
Conclusions
In
summary, we have established a convenient, efficient, and simple
method for the C(sp2)–H phosphorylation of 2H-indazoles using dialkylphosphites as phosphorylating agent
in the presence of Mn(OAc)3·2H2O. This
protocol is featured with regioselectivity, high functional group
tolerance, simple reaction conditions, and scalability. Based on our
experimental result, a radical mechanistic pathway has been suggested.
To the best of our knowledge, we are not aware of any earlier report
of direct phosphorylation of the 2H-indazole moiety
with phosphonate esters. We believe this direct C–P bond formation
strategy will achieve significant importance in material sciences,
pharmaceutical chemistry, and also in organic synthesis.
