Desorption/ionization induced by neutral clusters (DINeC)
was employed
for mass spectrometry (MS) of oligopeptides and lipids after separation
by means of thin-layer chromatography (TLC). Clear and fragmentation-free
spectra were obtained from the TLC plates without any further sample
treatment. Mass-resolved chromatograms were deduced when scanning
the TLC plates with the cluster beam along the direction of solvent
movement. Using vancomycin and noncovalently bound complexes, the
soft nature of DINeC was demonstrated also when used in combination
with TLC. As a test application, TLC and DINeC–MS were employed
to separate and detect different phospholipids obtained from egg yolk.

Introduction
Given its simplicity in terms of sample
preparation and application,
thin-layer chromatography (TLC) is a wide-spread method to separate
and identify complex mixtures in solution.1,2 However,
in the case of unknown compounds, additional spectroscopic information
is required for their identification. Thus, TLC has been combined
with additional analytical methods, such as absorption or fluorescence
spectroscopy. Alternatively, mass spectrometry (MS) as one of the
most powerful techniques in analytical chemistry and biochemistry
was successfully coupled to TLC.3−6 Different ionization techniques for MS have been
applied; among the most common are, for example, electrospray ionization
(ESI) and matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization (MALDI).4−7 For solution-based techniques such as ESI, the separated compounds
first have to be redissolved from the TLC plate in order to acquire
the mass spectrum of the mixture at a given spot on the TLC plate;8 the use of MALDI typically requires the application
of the respective matrix when using standard TLC plates.4,6,9 As a matrix-free, desorption-based
ionization method, secondary ion MS (SIMS) was combined with TLC;10 however, SIMS leads to substantial fragmentation
when sputtering organic molecules, even when large Ar clusters are
used as primary ions.11 Alternative approaches
to directly couple TLC with matrix-free desorption/ionization techniques
are thus further explored.12

Desorption/ionization
induced by neutral SO2 clusters
(DINeC) is a soft desorption-based ionization method for MS which
does not require any special sample preparation; it has been applied
for a multitude of different substances such as peptides, proteins,
lipids, and dyes.13−19 The SO2 clusters used in this method both provide the
energy required for desorption as well as they serve as a transient
matrix in which the analyte molecules are dissolved during cluster
surface impact.20 As a consequence, desorption/ionization
induced by neutral SO2 clusters proceeds at low cluster
energies and the desorbed molecules are effectively cooled by evaporation
of SO2 molecules from the cluster fragment in which the
desorbed molecule is dissolved.13 Thus,
DINeC features an in general very soft desorption process leading
to fragmentation-free spectra of the analyzed compounds.13,17,21,22

In this work, we show that TLC–MS can be performed
by means
of DINeC as desorption/ionization source. For mixtures of oligopeptides,
we obtained clear and fragmentation-free mass spectra of the biomolecules
directly from the TLC plates. Mass-resolved chromatograms along the
TLC plate were recorded by scanning the cluster beam with respect
to the plate (Figure 1). The advantage of the soft nature of DINeC was demonstrated, among
others, with the help of noncovalently bound adducts to angiotensin
II which were detected in samples directly prepared from the original
solution but which were removed after application of TLC. TLC + DINeC–MS
is thus a combination of TLC and MS with minimum effort in sample
preparation which is in particular suited when matrix-free and soft
desorption/ionization is required.

Figure 1 Schematics of the combination of TLC and
DINeC-MS. The TLC plate
is moved in z-direction in small steps with the position
of the SO2 cluster beam fixed. The clusters impact on the
sample and a small fraction of the analyte molecules is desorbed and
ionized. The ionized analyte molecules are then transferred into the
ion trap mass spectrometer.

Experimental Section
TLC was performed using commercial
TLC plates (TLC silica gel 60
F254, thickness approx. 200 μm, Merck Millipore,
Darmstadt, Germany). The plates were developed in a twin trough chamber
(CAMAG, Muttenz, Switzerland) using a mobile phase appropriate for
the respective analytes (details see below). Photographic images were
taken from the developed plates under irradiation with UV-light. Either
suppression of the plates’ green fluorescence (excitation at
λ = 254 nm) by analyte molecules or the blue fluorescence of
fluorescamine (excitation at λ = 366 nm), which was sprayed
onto the plates, was used to localize the compounds on the TLC plate.
For DINeC–MS, the TLC plates were mounted on a sample holder
and transferred into the vacuum chamber.

The ions generated
by means of cluster-induced desorption/ionization
were analyzed in a commercial ion trap mass spectrometer (amaZon speed, Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) equipped
with a custom-made DINeC source.17 In brief,
for generating the cluster beam, a gas mixture containing 3% SO2 and 97% He was expanded from 15 bar into high vacuum (p ≈ 1 × 10–6 mbar) using a
pulsed supersonic nozzle. The resulting SO2 clusters exhibit
a mean size of 103 to 104 molecules; the cluster
source is separated from the sample chamber by a skimmer (2 mm in
diameter) which determines the beam diameter on the sample. In the
current setup, the beam profile on the sample can be approximated
by a Gaussian profile of approx. 5 mm in diameter [full width at half-maximum
(fwhm)]; it can be significantly reduced (to <1.5 mm) in order
to resolve closer spots on the TLC plate when using a skimmer with
a smaller orifice. Cluster surface impact leads to desorption and
ionization of analyte molecules which are transferred into a quadrupole
ion trap. Position-dependent mass spectra were acquired by moving
the TLC plate in steps of 1 mm, measuring a mass spectrum at each
position. The experimental setup is summarized in Figure 1.

The oligopeptides angiotensin
II and vancomycin were dissolved
in water; a mixture of 2-butanol, water, pyridine, and ammonia solution
served as mobile phase.23 The method of
Bligh and Dyer24 was used to extract phospholipids
from the yolk of a chicken egg bought at a local supermarket. For
the lipids, a mixture of chloroform, triethylamine, ethanol, and water
with a volume ratio of 1:1:1:0.2 was used as the mobile phase.

Results and Discussion
Figure 2a shows
an image of the TLC plate after separation of a mixture of angiotensin
II and vancomycin. The image is a superposition of photographs taken
at both excitation wavelengths, 254 and 366 nm. It features two different
spots with a distance of approx. 8–9 mm between the spot centers.
In Figure 2b, an MS-chromatogram,
that is, intensity of a given m/z value as a function of position on the TLC plate, is shown for each
peptide. The maximum of the curve of the monoisotopic mass of vancomycin
(m/z = 1448.4) is at position z = 63 mm and it is around 7 mm in width (fwhm). This position
matches the dark blue spot in the photograph. The graph of the monoisotopic
mass of angiotensin II (m/z = 1046.6)
shows a maximum at position z = 75 mm. Thus, the
distance between the two respective intensity maxima is approx. 1
cm, in good agreement with the visual inspection of the TLC plate.
In case of the m/z = 1448.4 signal,
the background intensity is approximately zero, in case of the m/z = 1046.6 signal, a slightly higher
background is observed, in particular toward lower z-values. The latter correlates with the fluorescence signal of the
plate indicating traces of angiotensin II which have not been spatially
separated from vancomycin by means of TLC. The width of the peaks
observed in the MS-chromatogram are given by a convolution of the
cluster beam profile and the spot size on the sample. For increased
spatial resolution, the diameter of the cluster beam can be significantly
reduced when using a skimmer with reduced orifice diameter.

Figure 2 (a) Photographic
image of the TLC plate and (b) MS-chromatograms
after TLC of a mixture of angiotensin II and vancomycin. The image
of the TLC plate in (a) is a superposition of photographs taken under
illumination with UV-light at λ = 254 nm and λ = 366 nm,
indicating spatial separation of the two compounds. The chromatograms
in (b) show the intensities of the monoisotopic masses [M + H]+ taken from positive ion mass spectra acquired in small steps
from the TLC plate by means of DINeC–MS. The investigated m/z values were 1448.4 (vancomycin) and
1046.6 (angiotensin II).

The mass spectra obtained at the positions z =
63 mm and z = 75 mm are shown in Figure 3. At position z = 75 mm, the only peak detectable is attributed to angiotensin II
(m/z = 1046.6); at position z = 63 mm (bottom), the signal of vancomycin (m/z = 1448.4) is predominant. The insets in Figure 3 show the measured
isotopic patterns for angiotensin II (red) and vancomycin (blue) and,
for comparison, the respective simulated isotopic patterns (black).
The good agreement between the measured and simulated peak patterns
strongly backs the peak assignment as discussed so far.

Figure 3 Positive ion
mass spectra measured at the positions of the two
intensity maxima shown in Figure 2. Top: z = 75 mm, maximum of angiotensin
II intensity; bottom: z = 63 mm, maximum of vancomycin
intensity. The molecular peaks are labeled with the respective m/z value. Insets: Measured (red/blue)
isotopic pattern as obtained by averaging the spectra measured close
to the respective maximum. In comparison, the simulated isotopic patterns
of the respective analytes, angiotensin II (top) and vancomycin (bottom),
are shown in black.

We used vancomycin as one of our test compounds
as glycopeptides
are prone to fragmentation during desorption/ionization. In our spectra,
we find the [M + H]+ peak to be predominant, thus indicating
the soft nature of the cluster-induced desorption/ionization process.
Further evidence for the soft nature of DINeC and its advantage for
applications in TLC–MS is shown in Figure 4, where the mass spectra as obtained from
a batch of contaminated angiotensin II are shown. Figure 4a shows a positive ion mass
spectrum of a sample prepared by dropcasting angiotensin II of this
particular batch. It features a peak of the molecular ion of angiotensin
II, [M + H]+, as well as a prominent peak with an m/z value which is 408 higher than the
[M + H]+ peak. This peak is attributed to angiotensin II
carrying an adduct A3, [M + A3 + H]+, as we also observe
a peak at m/z = 409 which is then
attributed to [A3 + H]+. Furthermore, when we apply MS/MS
to the m/z = 1454.4 peak, major
fragment peaks occur at m/z = 1046.6
and m/z = 409. After TLC of the
same solution used for Figure 4a, the mass spectrum predominantly features a peak at m/z = 1046.6 but no peak at m/z = 1454.4. As DINeC is soft enough to desorb the
(M+A3)-complex, we can safely conclude that the adduct was separated
from angiotensin II in the TLC run. Both in Figure 4a,b, additional minor adduct peaks are detected
at m/z = 1068.4 and m/z = 1084.4 which correspond to [M + Na]+ and [M + K]+, respectively.25 They are attributed to some additional salt contamination of the
original solution.

sample on silicon oxide which predominantly features the bare, singly
charged ion [M + H]+, as well as three peaks indicating

and (3), respectively. The inset shows a range of lower m/z values where signals at m/z = 409 and m/z = 427
are detected, corresponding to [A3 + H]+ and [A3 + H2O + H]+, respectively, with m/z = 408 for A3. (b) Cationic DINeC mass spectrum after TLC

Figure 5 shows the
results of the analysis of lipids extracted from egg yolk. (a) and
(b) show two clearly different mass spectra obtained at the positions
labeled with the respective color in the photographic image of the
TLC plate shown in (b). The spectrum (a) contains peaks between m/z = 700 and m/z = 730 which can be assigned to SPH, the peaks between m/z = 750 and m/z = 820 were assigned to PC.6,26−28 In contrast, the spectrum in (b) has its main peaks between m/z = 860 and m/z = 920 which were assigned to PI;6,26−28 additionally, the peak at m/z = 756.5 was assigned to PE.26 For the assignment of the SPH, PC, PI, and PE peaks, protonated
species as well as lipids with sodium or potassium adducts were taken
into account (for details please refer to the Supporting Information); good agreement with literature was
obtained.6,26−28 We note a relatively
low abundance of PE in our spectra which might be attributed to differences
in the ionization probability.26,28

peaks can be assigned to sphingomyelin (SPH) and phosphatidylcholine

and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). (c,d) PC and PI spectra [as indicated
in (a,b)] in detail; assigned peaks are labeled with a star (compare
the Supporting Information,6,26−28).

In the following, we compare the combination of
TLC and DINeC with
established combinations of mass spectrometric analysis methods and
TLC, in particular TLC + ESI and TLC + MALDI. TLC + ESI is well established
and a high degree of automation allows simple handling of the TLC
plates after the chromatography step when the separated compounds
of the analyte have to be redissolved in order to spray them into
the ESI–MS system. Typical limits of detection (LOD) are in
the nanogram range. For MALDI, progress has been reported recently
in preparing TLC layers which do not need additional matrices.29,30 Standard method, however, is still to apply a matrix adjusted to
the compounds to be analyzed. In that case, an additional process
step is necessary between the TLC run and MS. Furthermore, matrix
molecules can lead to additional peaks in the lower mass range m/z < 300.

In contrast, the TLC
plate can be directly mounted into the DINeC
apparatus after the TLC run has been completed. The spectra are clean
and fragmentation free, as the method is extremely soft and no additional
matrix has to be applied. For an estimation of the LOD, we assume
that the analyte homogeneously covers the surface of the porous TLC
material, whereas the SO2 beam of DINeC–MS probes
only the surface of the uppermost particles of the TLC plate. If we
furthermore take into account typical values for thickness (d = 0.2 mm) and specific surface area of the porous material
(500 m2/g), as well as the detection limit of DINeC as
determined on flat samples (femtomol regime),13 an LOD in the nanomol range can be estimated for the TLC experiments.
It can be further reduced when using TLC plates with lower thickness.31 Still, TLC + ESI, which makes full use of all
analyte molecules in the TLC, is of advantage with respect to LOD.

In comparison to desorption ESI, which is also a soft, desorption-based
ionization method which can be directly coupled to TLC,12 DINeC has been shown to give quantitative information;19 it does not exhibit a significant matrix effect32 and can be also applied to nonpolar analytes.33

Conclusions
In conclusion, TLC was successfully combined
with MS based on desorption/ionization
induced by neutral clusters. The extremely soft desorption process
was shown to be also applicable for sample material distributed in
the porous TLC plates; clear and fragmentation-free spectra were obtained
from the plates after the respective TLC runs. Between TLC run and
DINeC–MS measurement, no additional sample treatment has to
be applied thus making this combination an easy-to-use method for
TLC-MS as demonstrated for the analysis of lipids extracted from egg
yolk. The soft nature of DINeC allows for clear identification of
weakly bound complexes and fragile molecules.
