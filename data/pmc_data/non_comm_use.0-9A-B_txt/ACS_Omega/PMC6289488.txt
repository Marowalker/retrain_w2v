Analytical methods based on ultraperformance
liquid chromatography/ion-trap mass spectrometry (UPLC/ion-trap MS)
were developed for quantification of atractylenolide I, II, and III
in the methanol extract of Atractylodes japonica rhizomes with a C18 column in an acidified water/acetonitrile
gradient eluent in an LC system, and ion-trap MS coupled with electrospray
ionization was employed under positive-ion mode. The three atractylenolides
were quantified in all A. japonica samples,
and the content of atractylenolide I, II, and III showed a significant
correlation to each other. Such high correlation was explained by
the mechanistic insights into the biosynthetic pathway of atractylenoide
III and I from atractylenoide II by using the biomimetic cytochrome
P450 model, [Fe(tmp)](CF3SO3) (tmp = meso-tetramesitylporphyrin). Atractylenolides could be transformed
by oxidation via the oxidative enzyme in the A. japonica plant. The present study first reports the first oxidative transformation
of atractylenolides using the heme iron model complex.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The plant Atractylodes
japonica Koidzumi is distributed in Korea, northeastern
China, and Japan, and its dried rhizome has been used to improve gastrointestinal
mobility by the induction of distal colon contraction and increasing
colonic transit time.1,2 Atractylenolide I, II, and III,
which are sesquiterpene-type bioactive compounds in A. japonica rhizomes, also exhibit gastrointestinal
activities both pharmacologically and clinically: atractylenolide
I has been shown to offer improved treatment of gastric cancer and
gastric cancer cachexia, and the stimulation of intestinal epithelial
cell migration and proliferation, and atractylenolide III has shown
gastroprotective activity against acute gastric ulcers.3−6 Hence,
it is thought that atractylenolides in A. japonica rhizomes play a key role in the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases.

Many analytical methods have been developed for the simultaneous
determination or quantification of atractylenolides in Atractylodes rhizomes. High-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC)-diode array detection methods have been widely employed for
the quantification of atractylenolides II and III in Atractylodes macrocephala rhizomes and atractylenolides
I and III in A. japonica rhizomes.7−9 Gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (MS) has also been used for the determination of atractylenolides
I and III in A. macrocephala rhizomes.10,11 Being regarded as sensitive and efficient techniques, the LC/triple
quadrupole MS method was adopted to identify and quantify atractylenolides
in the rhizomes of A. japonica, A. macrocephala, Atractylodes lancea, and Atractylodes chinensis.12 Recently, the identification and quantification
of atractylenolide I and III in the A. macrocephala rhizome by using LC/ion-trap MS has been reported.13 Ion-trap MS can be used to isolate and accumulate ions
through the application of characteristic electrodes and oscillating
electric fields, and the technique is advantageous for inducing ion
fragmentation and accumulation with higher resolution by collision-induced
decomposition.14−16 By
using these advantages, ion-trap MS has been applied for the identification
and quantification of chemical components in herbal medicines.17−19 Nevertheless, the quantitative
analysis of atractylenolides I, II, and III in A. japonica rhizomes using LC/MS, especially ion-trap MS, has not been reported.

Meanwhile, in cytochromes P450 (CYP450) is present in plants, high-valent
iron(IV)-oxo porphyrin π–cation radicals, referred to
as compound I (Cpd I), have been proposed as reactive intermediates
mainly involved in the biosynthetic pathway of sesquiterpenes.20 For example, the hydroxylation of alkanes by
Cpd I is initiated by a hydrogen atom abstraction (HAT) step, followed
by an oxygen rebound step.21 However, kinetic
and mechanistic insights into the hydroxylation of atractylenolides
by Cpd I have not yet been evidenced.

In the present study,
three marker compounds of the A. japonica rhizome, atractylenolides I, II, and III, were quantified in the
methanol extract of A. japonica samples
obtained from different locations in Korea and China using LC/ion-trap
MS. Moreover, the correlation between the amounts of the three marker
compounds in A. japonica samples was
evaluated by calculating Pearson’s correlation coefficient.
Moreover, we performed kinetic and mechanistic studies on the hydroxylation
of atractylenolides II by the iron(IV)-oxo porphyrin π–cation
radical complex, [(tmp+•)FeIV(O)]+.

2 Results and
Discussion
2.1 Optimization
of Chromatographic Conditions
Optimal conditions for chromatographic
analysis were established by comparing the column, mobile phase, mobile
phase modifier, and flow rate to separate and detect the three marker
compounds and the internal standard (IS) in A. japonica samples. A Thermo Hypersil GOLD C18 column (2.1 mm ×
100 mm, 1.9 μm) was chosen because it afforded improvement of
the peak shape and better resolution within 15 min, compared with
a Thermo Hypersil GOLD C18 column (2.1 mm × 50 mm,
1.9 μm). The mobile phase consisted of water and acetonitrile,
with 0.1% formic acid being added for better ionization of the marker
compounds and thus high signal intensity, as previously reported.22 The flow rate of the gradient elution was 250
μL/min as an optimal eluent for ionization of the marker compounds
and the IS in electrospray ionization (ESI) mode. Tandem mass scans
were conducted simultaneously, and the peak of each marker compound
was baseline separated (Figure S1, Supporting Information).

2.2 Optimization of Mass Spectrometric Conditions
To determine
the optimal ESI conditions for the ion-trap MS measurements, each
marker compound was directly injected into MS in both negative and
positive ionization modes. Higher signal intensity and good sensitivity
were observed in positive ionization mode than in negative ionization
mode, as shown previously.13,22−24 Thus, positive-ion mode was selected
for analysis of the three marker compounds in the A.
japonica samples. Different conditions such as sheath
gas (30, 40, and 50 arb units), auxiliary gas (10, 20, and 30 arb
units), capillary temperature (270–300 °C), and capillary
voltage (20, 30, and 40 V) were compared. The highest intensity of
protonated molecular ions and fragmented ions was obtained under the
following conditions: sheath gas, 50 arb units; auxiliary gas, 20
arb units; capillary temperature, 280 °C; and capillary voltage,
30.0 V.

The protonated molecular ion [M + H]+ of
atractylenolide III (m/z 249.00)
lost an H2O molecule and was converted into a fragment
ion (m/z 231.03), which was observed
with the highest intensity. The protonated molecular ion of atractylenolide
II (m/z 233.00) also lost an H2O molecule and was converted into a fragment ion with m/z 215.07, which was observed with the
highest intensity. Unlike the two compounds discussed above, the protonated
molecular ion of atractylenolide I (m/z 231.00) was mainly converted into a fragment ion (m/z 185.09). The protonated molecular ion of bergapten
(IS, m/z 217.00) lost a CH3 molecule and was converted into a fragment ion (m/z 201.98), which was consistent with previous results
(Figure S2, Supporting Information).12,13,22−25 The fragmented
product ions of each compound, m/z 231.03, 215.07, and 185.09 for atractylenolides III, II, and I,
respectively, were selected for identification and quantification
of the marker compounds in the methanol extracts of A. japonica samples.

2.3 Method Validation
The correlation coefficients
(r2) of each linear equation were in the
range of 0.9976–0.9991 within the linear ranges: 0.47–30.00
μg/mL for atractylenolide III, 0.31–20.00 μg/mL
for atractylenolide II, and 0.47–30.00 μg/mL for atractylenolide
I. LODs and LOQs were 23–43 and 78–146 ng/mL, respectively
(Table S1, Supporting Information). The
precision estimates of the LC/MS method determined for three concentrations
of marker compounds were 1.97–12.32% of the relative standard
deviation (RSD) value within one day and 3.19–12.03% of the
RSD value during three days (Table 1). Recovery of added compounds ranged from 83.50 to
101.93%, with the RSD value less than 14.00% (Table 2). The repeatability, represented as RSD
values, was 4.63–6.04% for the absolute peak area and 0.06–0.62%
for the retention time (Table S2, Supporting Information).

These results indicate that the LC/MS method developed here
allows linear, sensitive detection of each compound and that precise,
accurate, and reliable measurements can be obtained for the quantification
of the three marker compounds in the methanol extracts of A. japonica rhizomes.

2.4 Quantification of the Three Marker Compounds in A. japonica Samples
The fragmentation of
protonated ion molecules to the most intense fragment ions of m/z 249.00 → 231.03 for atractylenolide
III, m/z 233.00 → 215.07
for atractylenolide II, and m/z 231.00
→ 185.09 for atractylenolide I was employed for quantification
in A. japonica samples. The average
content of the three marker compounds varied across the A. japonica samples. The amount of atractylenolide
III was highest, followed by atractylenolides I and II in most samples
with significance, which is consistent with the previous study,22 although the no. 25 sample showed no significant
difference in contents. In addition, the differences in the amounts
(highest amount/lowest amount) of each compound were from 11- to 26-fold
within A. japonica samples (Table S3, Supporting Information).

A diverse range
of environmental circumstances, including location, climate, wild/cultivated,
seasons, and soil composition, is speculated to determine the production
or accumulation of sesquiterpenes in Atractylodes rhizomes because the occurrence of secondary metabolites is mainly
affected by such extrinsic factors.26−30 Moreover, the defense system of the Atractylodes rhizome against pathogens can also influence (mainly increase) sesquiterpene
accumulation through the induction of jasmonic acid, which is a plant-signaling
molecule in defense response.31 It is assumed
that those environmental and defensive factors result in various contents
of atractylenolides in A. japonica rhizomes
in different locations.

2.5 Correlation between the Average Content of the Three Marker
Compounds in A. japonica Samples
Correlations between the marker compounds based on the average
content measured in A. japonica samples
were evaluated by using Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r), which is a value that ranges from −1 to +1. Pearson’s
correlation coefficient is generally used to evaluate the degree of
linear interrelation between two variables and measures an influence
of one variable on the other variable.32

All pairs of average content of the three marker compounds
showed positive correlation coefficients with significance (p < 0.001); the pair of atractylenolide II–atractylenolide
III exhibited a higher coefficient (r > 0.9) and
the atractylenolide I–atractylenolide III pair had the lowest
coefficient (r > 0.5), following that of atractylenolide
I–atractylenolide II (r > 0.6) (Figure 1). Given that a higher
coefficient value (approaching to +1) indicates stronger correlation
and more linearity between two variables in a positive coefficient,33 the coefficients between the marker compounds
indicate that an increase in the amount of one compound can be related
to an increase in the amount of other compounds in A. japonica rhizomes. As the production of atractylenolides
is the result of their biosynthesis in A. japonica rhizomes, higher correlation between the content of atractylenolides
means that the existence of the compound is strongly related to the
course of the biosynthetic pathway. This connectivity in the contents
of compounds can be explained by their biosynthetic features. Atractylenolides
I–III, originally derived from atractylon, are serially converted:
during autoxidation, the C-8 hydrogen of atractylenolide II is oxidized
to a C-8 hydroxyl group, which is then converted into atractylenolide
III, which is dehydrated to atractylenolide I with a loss of hydroxyl
group at C-8 as a water molecule (Scheme 1).34,35

2.6 Oxidative Transformation of Atractylenolide
II Using the Biomimetic Model of Cytochrome P450
High-valent
iron(IV)-oxo porphyrin π–cation radical species have
frequently been invoked as key intermediates in the O2-activating
catalytic cycles of heme iron enzymes, such as CYP450, catalases,
and peroxidases.21,36,37 As
CYP450 participates in the formation of diverse sesquiterpenoids in A. lancea, it is assumed that CYP450 enzymes can
be found in plant A. japonica Koidzumi,38 thereby, allowing an alternative pathway of
the oxidative transformation of atractylenolides because of the plausible
formation of highly reactive Cpd I via O2-activation. On
the basis of this important hypothesis, one might expect a hydrogen
atom abstraction (HAT) from C–H bonds of atractylenolides by
Cpd I, followed by the hydroxyl rebound process that results in the
hydroxyl group incorporation into atractylenolides (Scheme 2).21

Scheme 2 Proposed Reaction Mechanism Adapted
from the Catalytic Cycle of Cytochrome P450 for C–H Bond Activation
Reaction
To investigate this hypothesis, we first generated the iron(IV)-oxo
porphyrin π–cation radical complex, [(tmp+•)FeIV(O)]+ (1) (tmp = meso-tetramesitylporphyrin) according to the literature
procedures. Addition of 2.4 equiv of meta-chloroperbenzoic
acid (m-CPBA) to the mixture solvent of CH3CN and CH2Cl2 (9:1) containing [FeIII(tmp)](CF3SO3) resulted in the formation of 1 at −40 °C (Figure 2a). We then explored the reactivities of 1 in the C–H bond activation reaction of atractylenolides.
Upon addition of atractylenolide II to the solution of 1, the absorption band at 665 nm due to 1 disappeared
with a concomitant increase of the absorption band at 505 nm because
of [FeIII(tmp)](CF3SO3) at −40
°C. The decay rate was increased linearly with the increase of
atractylenolide II concentrations; second-order rate constants (k2) of 1.5 × 10–1 M–1 s–1 was determined (Figure 2b).

at 665 nm. (B) Plot of pseudo-first order rate constants (kobs) against the concentrations of atractylenolides
II to determine k2 in the oxidation of
atractylenolide II by 1.

Very interestingly,
the product analysis of the reaction solution of the oxidation of
atractylenolide II by 1 revealed that atractylenolide
III was produced as a sole product with a quantitative yield (>95%
based on the amount of 1 used). When the atractylenolide
II oxidation was performed with 1 in the presence of H218O, atractylenolide III contained 90% of 18O under the identical reaction conditions (Figure 3). This result clearly indicates that the
source of oxygen in the hydroxylated product was the iron(IV)-oxo
porphyrin π–cation radical species through oxygen exchange
with 18O-labeled water. The conversion of atractylenolide
III to atractylenolide I via dehydration was also detected when the
resulting solution was kept under an air atmosphere for several hours.

III (right panel) obtained in the reaction of 1 and atractylenolide
II in the presence of H218O in CH3CN/CH2Cl2 (9:1) at −40 °C under
an Ar atmosphere. The 18O-labeled products were ∼80%.

We also characterized the iron product formed in the atractylenolide
II oxidation by 1. The negative mode ESI-MS spectrum
of the reaction solution exhibited a prominent peak at m/z of 836.8, whose mass and isotopic distribution
patterns correspond to [Fe(tmp)]+ (calculated m/z of 836.9) (Figure 4). Taken together, the hydroxylation of atractylenolide
II by 1 proceeded via HAT from the C–H bond of
atractylenolide II, followed by an oxygen rebound process, resulting
in the formation of [FeIII(tmp)]+ and atractylenolide
III. Dehydration of atractylenolide III to atractylenolide I was also
observed when the resulting reaction solution was kept for several
hours under an air atmosphere.

as [Fe(tmp)]+ (calculated m/z of 836.9). Inset shows the isotopic distribution patterns of [Fe(tmp)]+.

3 Conclusions
An efficient, accurate, and precise
analytical LC/ion-trap MS method was developed and applied for the
quantification of atractylenolide I, II, and III in A. japonica rhizomes with a validation in terms of
linearity, recovery, precision, and repeatability. The positive ionization
mode was employed for the detection of molecular ion fragmentation
at m/z 249.00 → 231.03 for
atractylenolide III, m/z 233.00
→ 215.07 for atractylenolide II, and m/z 231.00 → 185.09 for atractylenolide I. The average
contents of the three atractylenolides were determined in A. japonica samples obtained from different locations
in Korea and China. The results reveal a variation in the amounts
of analytes among the samples, and high correlations were observed
between the content of the atractylenolides in the samples. A significant
correlation between atractylenolides was evidenced by the CYP450-mimetic
oxidation model. Finally, we also provided (i) kinetic value of oxidative
transformation of atractylenolide II by high-valent iron(IV)-oxo porphyrin
π–cation radical species and (ii) experimental evidence
that the hydroxylation of atractylenolide II occurs via hydrogen atom
abstraction, followed by an oxygen rebound mechanism. These results
would be helpful to understand the existence and role of oxidative
enzymes, especially cytochrome P450, during the biosynthesis in the A. japonica plant.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals and Reagents
Commercially available
reagents were of the best available purity and were used without further
purification unless otherwise noted. LC/MS-grade acetonitrile, water,
and formic acid were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh,
PA, USA). HPLC-grade methanol was obtained from J.T. Baker Inc. (Phillipsburg,
NJ, USA). Acetonitrile (CH3CN) and dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) were dried according to the literature procedures
and distilled under Ar prior to use.39m-CPBA was purified by washing with phosphate buffer (pH
7.4) followed by water and then dried under reduced pressure.39 [FeIII(tmp)]Cl was purchased from
Frontier Scientific Inc. (Logan, UT, USA). [FeIII(tmp)](CF3SO3) was prepared by stirring equimolar amounts
of [FeIII(tmp)]Cl and AgCF3SO3, followed
by filtration through a 0.45 mm filter; the resulting solution was
used immediately.40 Atractylenolides I
and III were purchased from Biomart (Guangzhou, Guangdong, China).
Atractylenolide II was purchased from Chengdu Biopurify Phytochemicals
(Chengdu, Sichuan, China). Bergapten (IS) was purchased from ChemFace
(Wuhan, Hubei, China). All marker compounds had purities of ≥98%.

Forty-one samples of A. japonica rhizomes were either purchased from herbal companies or harvested
from the wild fields in Korea and China. The samples were authenticated
by the authors (Table S4, Supporting Information). Voucher specimens (2016-PNUKMAJ-01-41) have been deposited at
the School of Korean Medicine, Pusan National University.

4.2 Sample Preparation
The A. japonica rhizomes were pulverized and passed through
a 500 μm testing sieve (Chunggyesanggong-sa; Gunpo, Gyeonggi,
Korea) to produce a homogenized powder. Accurately weighed powder
(0.5 g) was extracted into 10 mL of methanol (w/v) for 30 min using
an ultrasonic extractor (Power Sonic 520; Hwashin Tech, Daegu, Korea).
The extracted solution was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 5 min.
The supernatant was transferred to a 1.5 mL polypropylene tube and
then evaporated using a nitrogen-blowing concentrator (MGS2200; EYELA,
Miyagi, Japan). The concentrated extract was dissolved in HPLC-grade
methanol to a concentration of 1000 μg/mL and filtered through
a 0.2 μm syringe filter (BioFact, Daejeon, Korea) prior to LC/MS
injection.

4.3 Analytical
Apparatus
An Accela LC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific;
CA, USA) equipped with a refrigerated autosampler, degasser, and quaternary
solvent pump was employed for the quantitative analysis. The three
marker compounds were separated on a Hypersil GOLD C18 column
(2.1 mm × 100 mm, 1.9 μm; Thermo Fisher Scientific, CA,
USA) at 35 °C. The flow rate was 250 μL/min, and the injection
volume was 5 μL. The mobile phase consisted of water (containing
0.1% formic acid; A) and acetonitrile (B), and an isocratic elution
was performed with an A/B ratio of 45:55 (v/v) until the end of the
analysis (to 15 min).

An LCQ Fleet ion-trap mass spectrometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific; CA, USA) was used to analyze the compounds
in the LC eluent, which was introduced into the ESI source in positive-ion
mode. Instrumental conditions were as follows: sheath gas (nitrogen),
50 arb units; auxiliary gas (nitrogen), 20 arb units; spray voltage,
5.0 kV, capillary temperature, 280 °C; and capillary voltage,
30.0 V. Tandem mass scans (MS2) from the protonated molecular
ion [M + H]+ were employed for quantification of the marker
compounds and the IS. The collision energy was set at 35% for collision-induced
dissociation in the MS2 experiment. Data were processed
using Xcalibur software (v. 2.1.0; Thermo Fisher Scientific, CA, USA).

UV–vis spectra were recorded on a Hewlett Packard Agilent
8454 UV–visible spectrophotometer equipped with a Unisoku cryostat
system (USP-203; Unisoku, Japan). Product analysis was performed with
Agilent Technologies 1220 Infinity II HPLC.

4.4 Method Validation
The three marker
compounds were accurately weighed and dissolved in methanol at 1000
μg/mL to make stock solutions, which were diluted to produce
seven working solutions containing the IS. The calibration curves
were constructed by plotting the peak area ratio of the three marker
compounds to the IS (y-axis) versus the concentration
of the three marker compounds in the working solution (x-axis). The linearity of each calibration curve was evaluated by
the correlation coefficients (r2). LOD
and LOQ were determined as signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios of 3 and 10,
respectively. Precision was determined by analyzing low, middle, and
high concentrations of working solutions of the marker compounds three
times within a day (intraday precision) and during three consecutive
days (interday precision). Values of precision are indicated as RSD,
as follows: RSD (%) = [(standard deviation/mean) × 100]. The
accuracy of the LC/MS method used was evaluated by recovery testing.
Three known amounts of marker compounds (low, middle, and high) were
added to the methanol extract of A. japonica samples, and the recovery was calculated as follows: recovery (%)
= [(detected concentration – initial concentration)/spiked
concentration] × 100.

4.4.1 Repeatability
The repeatability was indicated as RSD
values of retention times and RSD values of the absolute areas of
the marker compounds, based on six replicate analyses of a sample.

4.5 Statistical Analysis
Multiple comparisons between the contents of atractylenolide I–III
in each A. japonica sample were performed
by using Tukey’s test. Differences were considered significant
at p < 0.05, p < 0.01, or p < 0.001. Pearson’s correlation coefficient of
the average content of atractylenolide I–III in the A. japonica samples was calculated with significance
of p-values < 0.001. Multiple comparisons and
Pearson’s correlation coefficient were calculated by using
open-source software R (v. 3.4.3; The R Foundation for Statistical
Computing).

4.6 Kinetics
Studies
Reactions were followed by monitoring UV–vis
spectral changes of reaction solutions at −40 °C. All
reactions were run, at least, in triplicates, and the data reported
represent the average of these reactions. Iron(IV)-oxo porphyrin π–cation
radical species, [(tmp+•)FeIV(O)]+ (1), was prepared by literature methods.40 The formation of the iron-oxo intermediates
was confirmed by UV–vis spectroscopy. Subsequently, appropriate
amounts of atractylenolie II were added to the reaction solutions.
After the completion of reactions, pseudo-first-order fitting of the
kinetic data allowed us to determine kobs values. The resulting solution was directly injected to HPLC in
order to identify and quantify the reaction products. Products were
determined by comparing retention times and mass patterns to those
of known authentic samples. Atractylenolide III (>95%) was formed
as a sole product. Product yields were determined by comparison against
standard curves prepared with authentic samples.
