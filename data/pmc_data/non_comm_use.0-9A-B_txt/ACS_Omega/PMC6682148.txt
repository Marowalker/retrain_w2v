Here, we report the use of Li2Mn(SO4)2 as a potential energy storage
material and describe its route
of synthesis and structural characterization over one electrochemical
cycle. Li2Mn(SO4)2 is synthesized
by ball milling of MnSO4·H2O and Li2SO4·H2O and characterized using
a suite of techniques, in particular, ex situ X-ray diffraction, X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy on the
Mn and S K-edges to investigate the electronic and local geometry
around the absorbing atoms. The prepared Li2Mn(SO4)2 electrodes undergo electrochemical cycles to different
potential points on the charge–discharge curve and are then
extracted from the cells at these points for ex situ structural analysis.
Analysis of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (both near and fine structure
part of the data) data suggests that there are minimal changes to
the oxidation state of Mn and S ions during charge–discharge
cycles. However, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis suggests
that there are changes in the oxidation state of Mn, which appears
to be different from the conclusion drawn from X-ray absorption spectroscopy.
This difference in results during cycling can thus be attributed to
electrochemical reactions being dominant at the surface of the Li2Mn(SO4)2 particles rather than in the
bulk.

1 Introduction
Sulfates
and fluorosulfates have traditionally demonstrated electrochemical
activity only in Fe-based compounds. Among the sulfate-based positive
electrode materials, the systems of Li2M(SO4)2 (where M = Fe, Mn, Co) synthesized through solid-state
reactions have the highest redox potentials for Fe at 3.83 V (vs Li),1 second only to the ionothermally synthesized
fluorosulfate analogue that shows 3.90 V (vs Li).2 The high voltages achieved with Fe systems were attributed
to the inductive effect of the highly electronegative sulfate group.3 Subsequently, Co, Mn, and Ni, which traditionally
display reversible redox potential at higher voltages, were investigated.4,5 The advantage these high-voltage cathodes provide is the possibility
of high energy density. For Li2M(SO4)2, the theoretical energy density is 526 Wh kg–1 for Co; 496 Wh kg–1 for Mn; and 400 Wh kg–1 for Fe, if one Li ion is extracted and 1052 Wh kg–1 for Co;  991 Wh kg–1 for Mn;
and 800 Wh kg–1 for Fe, if two Li ions are extracted.
Atomistic modeling/density functional theory techniques predicted
the redox potential versus Li to be 5.2 V for Co and 4.54 V for Mn
systems6 and were experimentally backed
up by our previous work by Muthiah et al., demonstrating the electrochemical
activity at 5.02 V for Co and 4.85 V for Mn.7 The lack of performance was largely attributed to the presence of
Jahn–Teller distortion8 in the case
of Mn(III), and in the case of Co(II), stable electrolytes operational
at high voltages are rare. The most feasible candidate for exploring
a high-voltage range with minimal modification to a commercially available
electrolyte component is a cosolvent, called sebaconitrile and recent
reports have successfully utilized this electrolyte for manganese
and cobalt sulfate electrodes.9−12

This work details the structural modifications
during the electrochemical
process, whereas our previous investigations7 primarily concentrated on the full electrochemical analysis of Li2Mn(SO4)2 (LMS), electrolyte selection,
effect of particle size distribution, and analysis of X-ray diffraction
(XRD) data. We focus on structural analysis in this work to determine
electronic and geometric structural changes that take place during
the electrochemical process. This necessitates the use of advanced
characterization techniques, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

X-ray absorption spectroscopy
(XAS) is one of the most powerful
methods to determine both the electronic and geometric structures,
either in situ (during electrochemical operation) or by subjecting
the system to specific reaction conditions and investigating the samples
by ex situ methods. One of the main advantages of using XAS is that
it is element-specific, which allows the determination of both electronic
and geometric structures of the target element of interest within
the electrodes.13−16 Here, we seek to understand whether the electronic and geometric
changes associated with the redox reactions are similar to Li2Fe(SO4)2, where a Fe2+/3+ redox couple was observed through XAS analysis.17 It is well known that XAS is appropriate for investigating
the change in oxidation state and local structure of any type of system
as it is element-specific. Therefore, we used ex situ XAS to analyze
the electronic and geometric structural changes of the LMS cathode
by monitoring the Mn and S K-edges during the charge and discharge
cycles. In addition to this, XPS analysis was carried out as a complementary
technique since they both can access the chemical state of the elements
in the surface and near-surface regions, respectively. XPS is a universal
tool in surface analysis. By tuning the excitation energy from above
1000 eV down to a few hundred eV or below, the surface sensitivity
can be varied from a few nanometers to below a nanometer. This sensitivity
has been used extensively to study the surface composition and chemical
state of the reaction layer during its formation.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 X-ray Diffraction
Figure 1 shows the
powder X-ray diffraction
(PXRD) pattern of the starting Li2Mn(SO4)2 (LMS) cathode material. The similarity between the XRD patterns
of previously reported Li2Co(SO4)2 and Li2Fe(SO4)2 indicates that
Li2Mn(SO4)2 is isostructural with
the iron and cobalt compounds.18 We also
show in Figure 1 the
Rietveld refined (using TOPAS software) data using a starting structural
model of Li2Mn(SO4)2.1919 Rietveld analysis
of the LMS starting material gives lattice parameters a = 5.459(5) Å, b = 4.838(5) Å, c = 8.249(11) Å, α = γ = 90°, and
β = 106.30(10)° and in the monoclinic spacegroup P21/c (no. 14).

Figure 1 Best fit between calculated
XRD data (red), through refinement
of using crystallographic data employing TOPAS software, and the measured
XRD pattern (black) of the LMS as-prepared material. The difference
profile is shown in blue.

Figure 2 shows
the
structural model of LMS showing the MnO6 and SO4 octahedra and tetrahedra, respectively, and the coordination of
the Li ions between these units. Each MnO6 octahedra is
linked to six SO4 tetrahedra via shared oxygen vertices,
whereas each SO4 group is linked to only three MnO6 octahedra. The fourth corner of SO4, which is
free and not linked to any atom, leads to an open channel where the
Li ions are present.

purple
octahedral and SO4 is indicated by the yellow tetrahedra.
Green and red spheres represent the lithium and oxygen ions, respectively.

2.2 Electrochemistry
Figure 3 shows the
cyclic voltammetry
data of the first cycle illustrating the reversible electrochemical
activity of LMS. The cyclic voltammetry data for the other cycles
carried out on Li2Mn(SO4)2 are show
in the Supporting Information (Figure S2). Oxidation and reduction peaks are observed at 5.17 and 4.57 V
with respect to Li, respectively. The average redox potential of the
system was confirmed to be 4.87 V as per an earlier report by Muthiah
et al.7 Since the details of the profile
are discussed extensively in the work by Muthiah, we only give a brief
overview here before analyzing the structural changes that the cathode
material undergoes during the charge–discharge cycle.

Figure 3 Cyclic voltammetry
plot of Li2Mn(SO4)2 (LMS) for the
first charge–discharge cycle. Points
(A–E) represent the different cutoff potentials at which the
electrodes were stopped during the charging–discharging cycle
as shown in Table 1.

The open-circuit voltage of the
cathode material is 3.5 V (A) and
is chosen as the first state for subsequent ex situ XAS and XPS analyses.
This state provides the structure of the cathode material in its pristine
state. The second state considered for analysis is at 4.7 V (B). This
point was chosen as the cycling of the cell is carried out between
4.2 V (fully discharged) and 5.4 V (fully charged) and state B lies
halfway between these two states. The third state, C, chosen is that
of the fully charged state at 5.4 V. The fourth state, D, lies at
the same voltage of state B (4.7 V) but indicates the structural changes
during the discharge cycle. The final state analyzed, E, is at 4.2
V when the cell is fully discharged.

A noticeable feature of
the cyclic voltammetry test was current
intensity, which is low (in the μA range), indicating that only
a part of the cathode material participated in the redox reaction.
Ex situ XAS and XPS tests were carried out to shed light on this aspect
and on the structural changes of the LMS cathode during cycling.

2.3 X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) Analysis
2.3.1 X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Structure (XANES)
Analysis of Mn and S K-Edges
To understand the structural
changes that occur during the cycling process in the LMS electrodes,
various potentials were chosen along the charge–discharge curve
(see Figure 3, points
(A–E)) and are listed in Table 1. All of the electrodes
underwent the first electrochemical cycle, and the points (B–E)
were electrochemically charged and discharged to the potentials listed
in Table 1. The cells
were then disassembled in an Ar-filled glovebox, and the electrodes
were extracted for XAS studies. Ex situ XAS studies were then conducted
on all of these electrodes at the Mn and S K-edges.

Normalized Mn K-edge XANES data along with
Mn(II) and Mn(III) reference
compounds are shown in Figure 4a, and we discuss the pre-edge part of the data first, followed
by the changes that are observed in the main absorption edge. The
pre-edge for the Mn K-edge pristine sample can be seen to appear at
around 6537.9 eV, which is commonly assigned to a 1s to 3d transition,
and although it is disallowed by selection rule, it is observed in
many transition metal ion-containing systems. The reason they appear
is a combination of coordination environments and mixing of the d
and p orbitals.20,21 A negligible change is observed
in the pre-edge feature during the charging process (see Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). Also,
the pre-edge feature is weak, implying that Mn is mostly in a octahedral
coordination environment.22 Furthermore,
we do not observe a shift in the absorption edge (which is typically
seen if there is a change in oxidation state of the element of interest),
suggesting that there is no significant change in the Mn(II) oxidation
state. An attempt was made to analyze the shift using the first derivation
of the XANES data. The main inflection point shows a shift of 0.4
eV, which is too small to interpret as a change in the oxidation state
(see Figure S4 in the Supporting Information).
However, we observed changes in the white line intensity of the main
absorption (see Figure 4b,c) with charge and discharge, respectively. The white line intensity
results from strong transitions to final states confined to the near
vicinity of the absorbing atom. In general, for a K-edge spectrum,
the systems that have octahedral coordination show the highest intensity,
whereas the tetrahedrally coordinated systems show the lowest intensity.23 It has been observed that deviation from perfect
octahedral coordination can result in a decrease in the white line
intensity. Therefore, the decrease in the intensity and broadening
of the peak are likely due to an increasing disorder in the system.24 Thus, for LMS, we observe a decrease in the
white line intensity as the electrode is charged. However, as the
electrode undergoes discharge, the white line intensity appears to
increase further beyond the pristine sample. This indicates that there
is a possibility that the structure of LMS is more ordered in its
fully discharged state than it was in the starting material.

Figure 4 Normalized
XANES plots of the main absorption peak of Mn K-edge
for LMS electrodes stopped at different potential points (a). The
difference in the white line intensity of the normalized XANES plots
of the main absorption peak of Mn K-edge for LMS electrodes charged
to different potentials (b) and (c). During the charge cycle (b),
the white line intensity shifts slightly downward, but for the discharge
cycle (c), the intensity increases even beyond that of the starting
material.

The absorption edge for the sulfate
K-edge is at approximately
2479 eV, which is almost 10 eV higher than that for elemental sulfur,
as expected for S in the +6 oxidation state and as anticipated for
LMS. The main absorption peak for S K-edge appears at around 2185.5
eV, which corresponds to an S 1s—t2 (3p-like) transition.25−29 Any peak below that energy corresponds to 1s to 3s transition, which
is forbidden by the selection rules.30 Hence,
no pre-edge feature was observed for any of the LMS electrodes and
MnSO4 standard in the XANES data. As the peak position
is similar to that found for the standard material MnSO4 (2480.2 eV), we conclude that the oxidation state for S is +6. The
main absorption peak and the derivative peak for all of the cycled
electrodes overlap each other, as shown in Figure 5a,b, suggesting no change in the oxidation
state of sulfur and more importantly that the sulfate structure is
stable under the reaction conditions.

Figure 5 Normalized XANES of the main absorption
peak (a) and first-derivative
peak (b) is shown for the S K-edge of the LMS electrodes for different
points on the cycling curve. No change is observed in the peak positions
of sulfur with respect to the standard in comparison, MnSO4 (black dashed), thus proving that all of the sulfur lies at the
same oxidation state of +6 throughout the charge–discharge
process.

The analysis of the main absorption
peak in Figure 6a,b
shows a change in the white line intensity,
and as the electrode is charged, the intensity of the white line decreases,
which indicates an increased disorder in the system. However, as the
electrode is discharged and returns to its original state, the white
line intensity increases and overlaps with that of the starting material.
Therefore, a reversible change occurs with one cycle of charge–discharge
at the S K-edge. Table 2 shows the edge energies of both Mn and S K-edges of all of the electrodes
as determined from the XANES analysis.

Figure 6 Normalized XANES plots
of the main absorption peak of S K-edge
for LMS electrodes for different potential cutoff points are shown
during charge (a) and discharge (b). For the charge cycle, we see
that the white line intensity decreases in (a), whereas during discharge
(b), the intensity again increases back to its original position.

2.3.2 Extended
X-ray Absorption Fine Structure
(EXAFS) Analysis of Mn K-Edge
As mentioned earlier, the XANES
cannot be analyzed quantitatively; therefore, we use the first shell
EXAFS analysis to determine the local structure, in particular, the
interatomic distances surrounding the atom of interest. We focused
on the first nearest-neighbor analysis as this will be the most sensitive
in determining the change in the oxidation state of the manganese
ions. The key results obtained from the best fit between calculated
and experimental data are listed in Table 3.

b Bond valence sum is given by BVSi31 = ∑j=1n exp[(R0 – R)/B], where i is the binding site
(Mn), R0 is the empirically determined
constant; for Mn(II)–O, R0 = 1.79
and for Mn(III)–O, R0 = 1.76,32B = 0.37,31 an empirically determined constant, and n is coordination number of binding site i.

As the LMS electrode was charged
from its pristine state at 3.5
V to fully charged state at 5.4 V, a very slight variation in the
Mn–O bond length is observed. The average Mn–O bond
distance for the starting material is found to be 2.12 Å, and
with one full electrochemical cycle, the Mn–O bond for the
fully discharged electrode is found to be 2.09 Å. It is observed
that the change in Mn–O distances of all of the various treated
samples falls between 2.09 and 2.12 Å, which is very close and
supports the XANES observation that there is little to no change in
the oxidation of Mn in the bulk of the compound. The Debye–Waller
factor (σ2) for all of the LMS electrodes are found
to be in the range of 0.003–0.007 Å2. This
is mainly due to the nature of the fitting procedure we employed,
wherein we used the average Mn–O distance over six neighbors.
The crystal structure data suggests that there are four Mn–O
distances of ca. 2.11 Å and two Mn–O distances of ca.
2.22 Å. As our data range is between 3.2 and 9.8 Å (the
estimated resolution in the bond distance for this data range is 0.12
Å), we conducted our analysis using one single average bond distance.
Therefore, one would expect a slightly higher Debye–Waller
factor representing the static disorder. The best match between experimental
and calculated Fourier transform of the Mn K-edge data is shown in Figure S5 of the Supporting Information.

2.4 XPS Analysis of Mn 2p and S 2p
The
Mn 2p XPS data in Figure 7 and two main peaks between the binding energies of 640 and
660 eV were observed and assigned to Mn (2p1/2) and Mn
(2p3/2), respectively. The individual binding energies
are listed in Table 4.

Figure 7 Manganese Mn 2p ex situ XPS spectra of pristine, charged, and discharged
states of LMS electrodes.

Mn 2p XPS Spectra for Three Different Electrodes

discharge	fully discharged to 4.2 V	656.1	654.4	644.1	642.1	
The main trend observed is an increase of the binding
energy across
all peaks as the system is charged, indicating the presence of a higher
oxidation state.33 Further evidence of
change in the oxidation state can be seen through the appearance of
satellite peaks at 658.8 and 646.6 eV. An earlier report on MnO oxidation34 shows the formation of a similar satellite peak
upon an increased exposure of MnO to O2 at 673 K. This
was attributed to the layered growth of Mn2O3, and therefore, the XPS spectra was distinguished as a characteristic
of Mn in its 3+ oxidation state. Upon discharge, the satellite peaks
of both Mn (2p1/2) and Mn (2p3/2) disappeared,
indicating the conversion of Mn(III) to Mn(II), although a complete
reversal of the main peak binding energy to the original value of
the pristine electrode is not seen. This indicates that some percentage
of Li involved in the oxidation reaction has not participated in the
reduction reaction, thereby leading to some irreversible capacity
loss.33

The S 2p spectra are critical
to evaluate as it is likely that
the polyanionic part of the LMS compound could participate in the
electrochemistry of the battery and thereby cause changes in the capacity
or voltage. Figure 8 shows the S 2p spectra of all of the three states of the sample.
The binding energies of all of the three states of charge are almost
identical, although a marginal shift of the spectra of the fully charged
electrode toward a higher binding energy is observed. Nevertheless,
after complete discharge, the spectrum of the fully discharged electrode
overlaps with that of the pristine electrode, indicating that this
reaction is reversible.

Figure 8 Sulfur S 2p ex situ XPS spectra of pristine,
charged, and discharged
states of LMS electrodes.

While the Mn K-edge XAS data suggest that there is no noticeable
change in the oxidation state of Mn(II), a change in current is observed
from the cyclic voltammetry curve. However, the observed current during
the charging process is fairly low (in μA), indicating that
only a small part of the Mn(II) undergoes a redox reaction. XPS indeed
supports the finding as the changes seen in Mn 2p XPS are possibly
related to the Mn(II) ions present on the surface of the electrode
material, whereas the bulk remains unaltered.

3 Experimental Methods
3.1 Synthesis
3.1.1 LMS Material Synthesis
For the
synthesis of LMS, MnSO4 anhydrous and Li2SO4 (5% excess) were used as precursors. Anhydrous MnSO4 and Li2SO4 were prepared by heating MnSO4·H2O and Li2SO4·H2O (Sigma-Aldrich) in a tube furnace under an argon gas flow
for approximately 1 h. MnSO4·H2O was treated
at 300 °C and Li2SO4·H2O at 200 °C. The anhydrous powders were then mixed in a ratio
of 1.3:1 by weight, respectively, and ball-milled in a SPEX 8000M
high-energy ball mill for 30 min in a stainless steel vial. The resulting
powder was pressed into a pellet of 20 mm diameter using a pelletizer
at a pressure of 8 MPa. The pellet was then annealed in a box furnace
for 12 h at 500 °C with a temperature ramp of 5 °C min–1. After annealing, the pellet was ground, pelletized,
and annealed under the same conditions. Finally, the pellet was ground
to a fine powder before carrying out the structural analysis. The
powder was stored in an Ar-filled glovebox to prevent moisture absorption
as the material is sensitive to degradation by moisture.

3.1.2 Electrode Preparation
For the preparation
of the electrode, the LMS powder was mixed with Super P carbon in
the ratio of 80:20 (powder/carbon) and dried under vacuum in a Buchi
oven for 2 h. The dried mixture was then placed in a tungsten carbide
vial and ball-milled in a SPEX 8000D Mixer/Mill high-energy ball mill
for 20 h, with 10 min of cooling after each hour of milling. The milling
was done in a tungsten carbide vial to avoid Ni contamination, which
would otherwise occur in the case of a stainless steel vial. The ball-milled
powder was then dried at 250 °C in a Buchi oven for another 4
h before storing inside an Ar-filled glovebox.

3.1.3 Electrolyte Preparation
The electrolyte
used for the cell assembly of these electrodes can be synthesized
using LiPF6. A 1 M solution of LiPF6 was prepared
with a solvent of ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate/sebaconitrile
(15:15:70 by volume). The solution was stirred overnight inside an
argon-filled glovebox.

3.1.4 Cell Assembly
The powder was tested
as a cathode material in a half-cell configuration using a coin cell
(20 mm x 1.6 mm). The LMS powder was placed directly over the positive
case as the working cathode. Lithium foil was used as the counter
and reference electrode. The loading of the active material was 4
mg cm–2. Two pieces of porous glass microfiber (Whatman
cat. no. 1825-047, U.K.) were used as the separator and soaked in
the electrolyte solution (200 μL).

3.2 Material
Characterization
3.2.1 Electrochemical Characterization
3.2.1.1 Cyclic Voltammetry
Cyclic voltammetry
tests using Solartron Analytical were carried out over three cycles
at a scan rate of 0.05 mV s–1 between a range of
4.2 and 5.4 V for LMS.

3.2.2 Structural
Characterization
3.2.2.1 Powder X-ray Diffraction
Sample
purity was established using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) from
patterns collected with a Bruker D8 diffractometer (Bragg–Brentan
geometry) equipped with Cu Kα radiation, which operated at 40
kV and 40 mA. The as-prepared sample was mounted in a top-loaded sample
holder, and data were collected at 2θ from 10 to 80° using
a step size of 0.02°. Rietveld refinement of the XRD data was
carried out with TOPAS V4.1 (Bruker, 2008) using the fundamental parameter
approach.35

3.2.2.2 X-ray
Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS)
The samples for XAS measurements
were prepared by charging (or
discharging) the electrode in a coin cell setup to different voltages
followed by disassembly in the argon-filled glovebox. The electrode
was then scraped off in the powder form, sealed, and afterward transferred
to an XAS sample holder. The polypropylene tape-sealed electrodes
and the representative manganese oxide and sulfate standards were
measured at the X-ray absorption fine structure facility focused on
catalysis research (XAFCA) beamline36 of
the Singapore Synchrotron Light Source. The X-ray energy was calibrated
at the inflection point of the absorption edges of manganese and sulfur
elemental standards for Mn and S K-edges, respectively. All XAS measurements
were collected at a ring energy of ca. 0.7 GeV and a ring current
of ca. 200 mA. A Si(111) crystal monochromator was used, and data
were collected for both Mn and S K-edges at ambient temperature and
pressure. For Mn K-edge, the data were collected on XAFCA in Quick
EXAFS transmission mode in the range between 6418 and 7088 eV and
a typical scan time of 180 s. Multiple scans were collected and averaged
to improve the data quality and signal-to-noise ratio. For S K-edge,
the data were collected in fluorescence mode with a silicon drift
detector in the energy range between 2392 and 2551 eV with a scan
time of 20 min per scan and three scans were collected and averaged
to improve the quality of data. XAS data of reference compounds (MnSO4, Mn2O3) were collected using ca. 5
mg of respective powders mixed with ca. 60 mg of boron nitride and
pressed into a 10 mm diameter pellet, which was mounted onto the sample
holder for XAS measurements in either transmission (Mn K-edge) or
fluorescence (S K-edge) mode. The Mn and S K-edge X-ray absorption
near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure
(EXAFS) data were analyzed using Athena and Artemis software included
in the Demeter package for XAS analysis.37,38 Mn K-edge XAS data was fitted in the k range between
3.16 and 9.5 Å–1 and r range
between 1.5 and 3.4 Å with k weights of 1, 2,
and 3.

3.2.2.3 X-ray Photoelectron
Spectroscopy (XPS)
For the XPS measurements, the electrode
was scraped off in the
powder form and then transferred to the XPS chamber with minimal exposure
to air. XPS experiments were carried out using a PHI5802 Multitechnique
spectrometer, and each spectrum was collected after 1 min of Ar+ sputtering. XPS analysis of the system was carried out similar
to the XAS measurements on three electrodes of different states of
charge: (i) pristine uncharged, (ii) fully charged, and (iii) fully
discharged. The measurements were carried out for five elements: (i)
Mn 2p, (ii) Li 1s, (iii) S 2p, (iv) O 1s, and (v) C 1s, where the
C served for baseline correction.

4 Conclusions
In this work, Li2Mn(SO4)2 (LMS)
was successfully synthesized and electrochemically tested in a lithium
half-cell to demonstrate the average redox potential at 4.87 V vs
Li, which is the highest voltage observed for a Mn-based cathode material.
A detailed study of the redox process of this high-voltage, Mn-based
cathode material was carried out through ex situ XAS and XPS techniques.
Analysis of the XANES and EXAFS data reveals that the oxidation state
of Mn ions remained to be 2+ through the electrochemical reaction.
The S K-edge shows no change in the oxidation state during cycling,
implying that the sulfate ions are stable under the reaction conditions.
XPS studies reveal that the redox couple of Mn2+/3+ is
present; however, this technique is sensitive to the ions present
near the surface of the material, whereas XAS provides information
of the entire bulk of the sample. The results are consistent with
the observation in the current density seen in the electrochemical
study wherein only micro-ampere increase is observed during the charging
cycle. Therefore, we conclude that only the Mn(II) ions present on
the surface of the electrode particles are oxidized to Mn(III) ions
and contribute to the electrochemistry, whereas the bulk of the material
does not participate in the electrochemical reaction. Nanosizing of
the LMS cathode material through novel synthesis techniques would
aid in increasing the surface area of the cathode and thereby improve
its performance, making it viable for commercial use.
