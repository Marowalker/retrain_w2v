An N-heterocyclic carbene-catalyzed
intermolecular Stetter reaction
of aromatic aldehydes with N-substituted itaconimides
has been developed. A delicate balance between the Stetter reaction
and the competing isomerization of the itaconimide double bond has
been achieved in this operationally simple reaction to afford valuable
new succinimide derivatives containing 1,4 and 1,5 dicarbonyl scaffolds
in good to excellent yields. The reaction tolerates variable substituents
on both aldehydes and N-substituted itaconimides.

Introduction
N-Heterocyclic carbenes
(NHCs), a well-documented class of catalysts,
have attracted immense attention due to their potential applications
in the field of synthetic organic chemistry.1 During the last few years, efforts have been devoted to the development
of novel synthetic methodologies in which NHC catalysts are involved
as active organocatalysts or ligands for metal-catalyzed reactions.
Consequently, recent research substantiates an increasing utilization
of NHC toward the synthesis of natural products and useful bioactive
molecules from simple feedstocks.2 In NHC-organocatalyzed
reactions, the nucleophilic carbene transforms the aldehyde functionality
into an acyl anion equivalent via polarity reversal (Umpolung), which
enables aldehydes to react with various electrophiles. The nucleophilic
addition of acyl anions to various Michael acceptors (Stetter reaction)
has been illustrated as a powerful organocatalytic transformation,
which offers an elegant approach to construct new carbon–carbon
bonds.3 The Stetter reaction with various
Michael acceptors provides 1,4-difunctionalized products, which constitute
highly valuable building blocks in organic synthesis.4 NHC-catalyzed generation of active acyl anion intermediate
and its intervention into new Michael acceptors is a challenging and
desired synthetic transformation.3

This work endeavors to study the NHC-catalyzed conjugate addition
of acyl anions to N-substituted itaconimides, representing
an important and efficient synthetic method to construct valuable
succinimide derivatives. The succinimide derivatives are significant
compounds found in various natural products, which reveal a remarkable
biological and pharmaceutical activity. Also, they have several important
applications in agrochemicals, functional materials, and polymer sciences.5 Maleimides are considered to be the general synthon
for the preparation of succinimide derivatives. Generally, nucleophilic
additions to the active endocyclic polarized double bond or transition-metal-catalyzed
C–H activation via olefin insertion are some of the strategies
for the preparation of succinimide derivatives from maleimides.6 Apart from these methods, less attention has
been given to itaconimide derivatives, which are considered as possible
synthons for succinimide derivatives. The active exocyclic double bond and an enolizable
amide bond of the N-substituted itaconimide have
been recognized as important moieties for the construction of succinimide
derivatives.5k Despite these advantages,
one challenge that has to be addressed in the application of N-substituted itaconimides is a base-induced isomerization
to 3-alkyl N-substituted maleimides,7 presumably due to their high thermodynamic stability.

Until now, few reports demonstrated Michael acceptor reactivity
of N-substituted itaconimides (Figure 1). Tan and co-workers reported enantioselective
1–4 nucleophilic addition of phospine oxides and thiols with N-substituted itaconimides, catalyzed by chiral bicyclic
guanidine, which acts as a strong chiral Brønsted base (Figure 1, eqs 1 and 2).8 Recently, Jiang et al. demonstrated an elegant
approach for the addition–protonation reaction of azlactone
with N-substituted itaconimides (Figure 1, eq 3).9 Although the Michael addition of nucleophiles such as heteroatomic
anions and carbanions is known, to the best of our knowledge, transformation
using nucleophilic acyl anions has not been reported. Notably, by
taking advantage of the active exocyclic double bond of N-itaconimide, herein, we report its NHC-catalyzed Stetter reaction,
avoiding the double-bond isomerization (Figure 1, eq 4).

Results and Discussion
We began our study by preparing the
N-substituted itaconimide using
a novel method. Recently, our group developed an expedient protocol
for the synthesis of maleimide and succinimide derivatives by using
a new dehydrating agent (NH4)2S2O8/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).10 In
continuation of that, herein, we applied the same protocol in the
synthesis of N-aryl itaconimide derivatives. The
developed reaction condition worked very well and tolerated various
electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents on primary
aromatic amines (Scheme 1). Our protocol is advantageous over the commonly used acetic anhydride-sodium
acetate condition.11 The N-alkyl-substituted itaconimides were synthesized from maleimides
by using the known literature procedure.12

Scheme 1 N-Aryl Itaconimides from Aromatic Amines and Itaconic
Anhydride,
Reaction
conditions: (i) amine
(1 equiv, 1 g scale), anhydride (1.1 equiv), 1,4-dioxane (0.1 M),
25 °C, 30 min; (ii) APS (2 equiv), DMSO (2 equiv), 100 °C.

Isolated yields.

Our first effort for the Stetter reaction began by treating p-chlorobenzaldehyde (5) with N-phenyl itaconimide (4a) in the presence of 20 mol %
thiazolydene-derived pre-NHC catalyst A and 20 mol %
of K2CO3 in tetrahydrofuran (THF) at room temperature.
To our delight, the reaction led to the expected product 6a in 55% yield. However, under this reaction condition, the base-facilitated
isomerized product N-phenyl maleimide was also observed
along with the Stetter product. To increase the yield of the Stetter
product 6a and to suppress the formation of isomerized
side product 7, four different reaction parameters were
examined, which include pre-NHC catalysts, reaction temperature, bases,
and solvents. First, different pre-NHC catalysts B–E were screened, but they appeared to be less effective as
compared to catalyst A (Table 1, entries 2–5). All of the pre-NHC
catalysts were screened with catalyst loading of 15 mol %. Further,
performing the reaction at room temperature furnished 6a in diminished yield (Table 1, entry 6). Screening of different bases for the generation
of active carbene intermediate from pre-NHC catalyst concludes that
various bases such as Cs2CO3, NEt3, and DBU furnished the expected product in low yield with increased
production of the side product 7 (Table 1, entries 7–9), but K2CO3 emerged as the best base for this transformation. Also, it
was observed that lowering the catalyst loading and equivalent of
base substantially decreases the yield of the product (Table 1, entry 10). Furthermore, we
observed the formation of more side products with an increase in the
equivalents of a base, which resulted in a lower yield of 6a (Table 1, entry 11).
Solvent effects on this transformation were also studied, wherein
other solvents such as acetonitrile, 1,4-dioxane, and toluene were
found to be unfavorable for the current scenario (Table 1, entries 12–14). Next,
the molar ratios of substrates 5 and 4a were
also examined. Conducting the reaction with reduced equivalents of N-phenyl itaconimide showed a reduction in the yield (Table 1, entry 15). The optimized
reaction condition (entry 1) afforded the expected Stetter product 6a up to 80% yield with 4% of 7.

With the optimized conditions in
hand, we planned to study the
substrate scope of this NHC-catalyzed Stetter reaction. Initially, we screened the itaconimides
having various N-substituents by keeping p-chlorobenzaldehyde as the synthetic equivalent of the
acyl anion. The developed reaction condition worked well for both N-aryl- and N-alkyl-substituted itaconimides.
Gratifyingly, N-aryl itaconimides with a range of
electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups on the aromatic
ring were well tolerated to furnish the expected Stetter products
in 38–95% yields (Scheme 2, 6a–h). There was
no drastic difference in the reactivity pattern associated with electron-donating
or electron-withdrawing functional groups on the aromatic ring of N-aryl itaconimide. As mentioned above in the optimization
study, the N-phenyl itaconimide 4a provided
the expected product in 80% yield. Also, the developed protocol gave
a good yield when tested on a higher scale (5.0 mmol). Moreover, N-aryl substituted with −OMe, −Me, and halo
functional groups (Scheme 2, 6b–e) gave the corresponding
product in good to moderate yields, whereas electron-withdrawing substituents
−CF3, −NO2, and −CN gave
Stetter product in moderate to good yields (Scheme 2, 6f–h).
Moreover, N-alkyl itaconimides also worked well,
leading to the desired products with moderate yields under the developed
reaction condition (Scheme 2, 6i–k). The product 6k was obtained from 4-CN benzaldehyde in 1:1 d.r. We did
not observe any chirality induction, probably because the chiral center
in 4k is far away from the reaction center. Furthermore,
we observed less than 5% isomerization of itaconimide to the corresponding
methyl-substituted maleimides in all of the above substrates, but
maleimides remained unreactive under the standard reaction condition.

Scheme 2 Variation in the Itaconimide N-Substituents,
Reaction
conditions: 5 (1.0 equiv, 0.35 mmol), 4a–k (1.5
equiv, 0.52 mmol), pre-NHC catalyst A (15 mol %), K2CO3 (50 mol%), THF (2 mL), under argon atmosphere.

Isolated yields.

Reaction at 5.00 mmol scale.

After exploring the reactivity pattern of N-substituted
itaconimides,
we further intended to explore the scope of the reaction using substituted
aldehydes by keeping N-phenyl itaconimide as the
Michael acceptor. Both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating
aldehydes worked well, leading to the formation of the desired products
(Scheme 3, entries 8a–h) in moderate to good yields. The
unsubstituted aldehyde substrate, benzaldehyde, provided the expected
product 8a with diminished yield. The 4-fluoro and electron-donating
substituent 3-OMe gave the Stetter products in moderate yields (Scheme 3, 8b and 8c). Moreover, it was observed that the aldehyde
substrates with electron-donating substituents have a much longer
reaction time for completion of the reaction as compared to the electron-withdrawing
substituents. The developed reaction condition worked well with aromatic
aldehydes having electron-withdrawing groups and gave corresponding
products smoothly in good yields (Scheme 3, 8d–f).
Furthermore, β-naphthaldehyde gave 8g in 41% yield.
Interestingly, the protocol was also suitable for heterocyclic aldehyde
and gave the desired product 8h in good yield (Scheme 3). However, the developed
condition failed to give the expected products with butyraldehyde
and cinnamaldehyde (Scheme 3, 8i and 8j).

Scheme 3 Variation in the
Aldehyde Substrate,
Reaction conditions: 5a–h (1.0
equiv, 50 mg), 4a (1.5 equiv),
pre-NHC catalyst A (15 mol %), K2CO3 (50 mol%), THF (2 mL), under argon atmosphere.

Isolated yields, N.D. = not detected.

Conclusions
In summary, we developed a convenient and
hitherto unknown NHC-organocatalyzed
Stetter reaction of aromatic aldehydes with N-substituted itaconimides
affording valuable new succinimide derivatives in good to excellent
yields under an operationally simple reaction condition with broad
substrate scope. We are in the process of application of the developed
protocol in the synthesis of small bioactive molecules and natural
products. Furthermore, our next investigation involves the application
of a developed protocol on itaconic anhydride/acid/ester and the development
of an asymmetric variant of this reaction.
