By
combining topological structures of hyperbranched polymers with
dendronized polymers, a series of hyperbranched poly(acylhydrazone)s
pendanted with 3-fold branched dendritic oligoethylene glycol (OEG)
units were efficiently prepared through A2 + B3 polycondensation. The constituents of these dendritic polymers can
be mediated through dynamic covalent acylhydrazones. Owing to the
dense OEG pendants, these dendronized hyperbranched polymers are biocompatible
and thermoresponsive, and their cloud points (Tcps) can be modulated by the branched architecture, solution
pH, and addition of a third component. Cell viability in the presence
of these hyperbranched poly(acylhydrazone)s can be maintained above
80%. Based on the unique dendritic architecture with rich acylhydrazine
groups, dynamic hydrogels cross-linked via acylhydrazone linkages
with good mechanical property were prepared, which inherit the characteristic
thermoresponsive behavior of the polymer precursors and also show
remarkable self-healing properties. This novel kind of topological
polymers and their corresponding hydrogels with dynamic and multiple
smart properties may have promising applications as biomaterials.

1 Introduction
Dendritic
polymers such as dendrimers, hyperbranched polymers,
and dendronized polymers are highly branched polymers with complex,
secondary architectures and well-defined spatial location of functional
groups.1,2 Unlike other dendritic polymers, hyperbranched
polymers show the prominent superiority of efficient one-step synthesis
and a flexible regulation of structures.3−6 Although hyperbranched polymers possess
irregular branching structure, they have low viscosity and large amount
of functional groups at both the linear and terminal units. In recent
years, hyperbranched polymers with stimuli-responsive moieties have
been intensively investigated due to their promising applications
in areas such as targeted drug delivery, catalysis, hybrid materials,
light-emitting materials, surface engineering, and biomimetic materials.7,8 In particular, control of hyperbranched polymers’ architecture
and surface groups combined with responsiveness and adaptability make
them promising gelators for hydrogel formation. Hyperbranched polymer
hydrogels formed from both physical or chemical cross-linking reaction
show good mechanical properties and encapsulation ability, which can
be used for cell adhesion and biomolecule delivery.9−16 Dendronized polymers are a class of nanoscopic, rigid polymers with
densely packed dendrons as the pendent group. By combining the topological
structures from dendronized and hyperbranched polymers, the formed
dendronized hyperbranched polymers show a unique architecture and
inherit the advantages from both types of polymers. The dendronized
hyperbranched polymers possess more possibilities for functionalization
compared to a dendron,5 and their structural
defect should be much less than those of normal hyperbranched polymers.
For example, by the introduction of low generation of nonlinear optical
(NLO) dendrons, a series of dendronized hyperbranched polymers were
prepared that possess high NLO coefficient, good stability, and good
solubility.17−20 However, the reported hyperbranched polymers constructed with dendritic
units lack responsive properties, which limits their further applications.

Dynamic covalent chemistry has been proved to be an effective strategy
for preparing polymers with different architectures and can afford
the polymers not only enhanced stability but also constitutional reversible
features.21−23 Recently, we reported dynamic covalent thermoresponsive
dendronized polymers prepared through polycondensation of dendritic
oligoethylene glycols (OEG) cored with dialdehydes and diacylhydrazine.24 These polymers, with acylhydrazone bonds at
their main chains, were found to show dynamic covalent bond exchange;
thus, they can generate new constitutional polymers with different
cloud points by the addition of a third dendritic monomer with different
hydrophilicity. Other dynamic covalent hyperbranched polymers including
hyperbranched polyacylhydrazones,25 polyoximes,26 and copolymers with disulfide27 and Diels–Alder28 linkages
have also been developed. However, dendronized hyperbranched polymers
formed through dynamic covalent chemistry at their backbone are rarely
reported.

In this work, a novel kind of dendronized hyperbranched
poly(acylhydrazone)s
with different branched architectures were prepared by traditional
A2 + B3 polycondensation of first-generation
(G1) OEG-dendron cored with dialdehyde and triacylhydrazine with different
molar ratios. The formed dendronized hyperbranched polymers possess
unique thermoresponsive behavior. Different from the linear OEG-dendronized
polyacylhydrazone reported previously,24 these hyperbranched polymers possess abundant acylhydrazine end
groups, providing chances for further modification to form functional
materials. The effect of polymerization conditions on molecular weight
and degree of branching was studied, and their thermoresponsive properties
were investigated by UV–vis spectroscopy. The dynamic constitutional
feature of these dendronized polymers were examined by switching solution
pH and also through the addition of competitive monomers with different
hydrophilicity to mediate polymer thermoresponsiveness. Moreover,
thanks to the surplus peripheral acylhydrazine units, which can be
further cross-linked with dialdehyde-terminated poly(ethylene glycol)
(PEG) to form hydrogels with thermoresponsive behavior and self-healing
ability. The influence of solution pH, gelator concentration, and
content of cross-linker on the mechanical property of the hydrogel
were evaluated by oscillatory rheology (Figure 1).

polymers and their corresponding hydrogels from dynamic covalent cross-linking.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Characterization of Hyperbranched
Polymers
To obtain dynamic covalent hyperbranched polymers,
monomers carrying aldehyde and acylhydrazine groups were prepared.
Ethoxyl-terminated G1 dendritic OEG cored with dialdehyde is used
as an A2 monomer, which also affords polymers characteristic
thermoresponsive behavior. Tri(acylhydrazine) amine was used as a
B3 monomer. Both A224 and B329 were synthesized
according to previous reports. Dendronized hyperbranched poly(acylhydrazone)s
with different branched architecture were prepared by traditional
A2 + B3 polycondensation of dialdehyde with
triacylhydrazine in a solution of pH 4.0. The detailed polymerization
conditions and typical polymerization results are summarized in Table 1. Three polymers were
prepared at the A2/B3 molar feeding ratios of
0.8, 1.0 and 1.5, respectively, and their weight-average molecular
weights (Mws) were determined to be in
the range of 4.0–11.9 × 104 by gel permeation
chromatography with light-scattering detector (GPC-LS) with N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as the eluent
(Figure S1). All polymers were characterized
by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Figure S2). The proton signal assigned to the terminal acylhydrazine group
(δ = 9.0) decreases with increase of the dialdehyde monomer
as the linear unit. The degrees of branching (DBs) for dendronized
hyperbranched poly(acylhydrazones) are calculated based on proton
integrations from 1H NMR spectra, which are in the range
from 0.60 to 0.30.

a DBs of hyperbranched
polymers were
calculated based on proton integrations of the corresponding units
according to the equation: DB = (D + T)/(D + T + L), where D, T, and
L represent the fractions of the dendritic, terminal, and linear units,
which correspond to the proton signals of 11.48, 9.01, and 5.05 ppm,
respectively.

b Tcps
of the polymers in pH 7.0 buffer solutions were determined as the
temperature at 50% of the initial transmittance at λ = 700 nm.

These polymers are well soluble
in water at room temperature but
precipitated out, and their solution becomes turbid when heated at
elevated temperature. Temperature-varied UV–vis spectroscopy
was used to follow thermally induced transition of the dendronized
hyperbranched poly(acylhydrazone)s and detect their cloud points (Tcps). Figure 2a shows the transmittance of polymers at 0.25 wt %
in pH 7.0 buffer solutions at a constant heating rate of 0.5 °C
min–1, and Tcps for P1, P2, and P3 were determined to
be 47.2, 45.5, and 39.4 °C, respectively. Although containing
hydrophilic acylhydrazine moieties, phase transition regions of these
polymers span a narrow temperature range (less than 2.5 °C).
This sharp transition indicates that dendritic OEGs provide efficient
shielding to the hyperbranched polymers with prominent thermoresponsive
properties. Furthermore, Tcp decreases
from 47.2 to 43.9 °C with DB from 0.60 to 0.30, suggesting that
dendron coverage dominates their thermoresponsive behavior. The concentration
effect on the phase transition of P1 was checked. Turbidity
curves of P1 with concentration ranging from 0.1 to 3
wt % are shown in Figure S3a, and the dependence
of cloud point on its concentration is plotted in Figure S3b. It was found that the cloud points decrease gradually
from 49.9 to 40.8 °C with increase of concentration, which may
be due to the enhanced aggregation kinetics at higher concentration.
Although when the solution concentration is increased to above 2 wt
%, the cloud points tend to become similar to each other. The effect
of heating rate on the cloud point was also checked. As shown in Figure S4a, a minor influence on the cloud points
was observed by the heating rate lower than 2 °C min–1. However, when heating rate is very high, such as in the case of
4 °C min–1, delayed kinetics during the thermally
induced aggregation results in an apparent higher Tcp. A hysteresis effect (Figure S4b) was observed between heating and cooling, which may be related
to large amount of hydrazone bonds that form a strong hydrogen bonding
between the polymer chains. All polymers exhibit a pH-dependent thermoresponsive
behavior, and their Tcps are varied at
various pH conditions. As shown in Figure 2b, the Tcps of
polymers decrease efficiently with the decrease of the solution pH.
The turbidity curves of all three polymers are shown in Figure S5. P1 was taken as the example.
Its Tcp decreases from 47.2 to 41.6 °C
when the solution pH decreases from 7 to 2. We suspect this significant
effect may be due to the acid-induced decomposition of acylhydrazone,
which releases more hydrophobic acylhydrazone moieties. For clarifying,
the 1H NMR spectra of a model acylhydrazone compound from
tri(acylhydrazine) amine with a monoaldehyde at different pH conditions
were recorded (Figure S6). At solution
pH of 2.0, a clear proton signal corresponding to acylhydrazine appears,
indicating decomposition at strong acidic condition. The remarkable
characteristics of dynamic covalent polymers relay on their structural
variability upon the addition of third components through the exchange.
Therefore, dialdehyde monomers with different hydrophilicities were
added to form the hyperbranched polymers to examine the tunability
of their structures as Tcp. Glutaraldehyde
and methoxyl-terminated dendritic OEG cored with dialdehyde (A2′)
were selected as additive monomers. The former is more hydrophobic,
whereas the latter is more hydrophilic, and their influence on polymer Tcp is shown in Figure 2c. Considering the time-consuming process
of exchange reaction for acylhydrazone, mixture of P1 with competitive monomer in a buffer solution with pH 2.0 was kept
at room temperature for 5 days. After the addition of 1.1 equiv hydrophobic
glutaraldehyde, Tcp of P1 decreases from 41.5 to 39.2 °C. However, after the addition
of 1.1 equiv hydrophilic A2′, Tcp of P1 increases from 41.5 to 43.8 °C. These results
indicate that the Tcp of dendronized hyperbranched
poly(acylhydrazone)s can be tuned by constitutional dynamics.

rate = 0.5 °C min–1.

Considering their potential application as biomaterials,
we examined
the in vitro cytotoxicity of these dendronized hyperbranched polymers.
Cell-counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to investigate viability
of HeLa cells in the presence of these polymers. As shown in Figure S7, no obvious decrease in cell survival
rate was observed when the concentration of all these polymers was
below 50 μg mL–1. Even when the concentrations
of P1 and P2 reached 100 μg mL–1, all cells kept their viability. However, when the
concentration of P3 reached up to 50 μg mL–1, the cell viability showed an obvious decrease. These
results indicate that all polymers show good biocompatibility at low
concentration, which may pave the way for their bioapplications.

2.2 Hyperbranched Poly(acylhydrazones) Hydrogels
via Acylhydrazone Chemistry
Due to abundant peripheral acylhydrazine
groups, dendronized hyperbranched poly(acylhydrazone)s can be further
cross-linked through reaction with dialdehyde. Dialdehyde-terminated
PEG (Mn = 1000) (PEGDA) was
selected as the cross-linker because PEG shows good biocompatibility
and well solubility in buffer solutions. Dendronized hyperbranched
poly(acylhydrazones) hydrogels were formed from P1 via
acylhydrazone cross-linking, and the hydrogel formation was visually
recognized by the reversed vial test method. Hydrogels with different
pH solution, gelator concentration (wt %), and content of cross-linker
were prepared (Table 2). The optimal condition for hydrogel formation was determined, and
the results are summarized in Table S1.
All conditions, including solution pH, concentration, and P1/PEGDA ratios, affect the formation and mechanical properties of the hydrogels.
Very fast gelation occurred at pH 2.0. As shown in Figure 3a, the hydrogel GEL1 from pH 2.0 buffer solution of 15 wt % P1 (with acylhydrazine/aldehyde
ratio = 2.10:1) was formed in 15 min and can withstand various deformations
such as elongation and folding. Gelation also occurred at intermediate
pH 4.0 but required significantly longer reaction periods (more than
2 h). The enhanced gelation efficiency at low pH is understandable,
since hydrazone formation can be catalyzed by acid. However, with
gelator concentration of 10 wt %, the mixture of P1 and PEGDA can form hydrogels in the pH 2.0 buffer solution but
not in the pH 4.0 buffer solution. The lowest concentration to form
hydrogels from P1 via PEGDA was also confirmed
through the inversion method. It was found that the lowest concentration
for hydrogel formation at pH 2.0 and 4.0 is about 10 and 15 wt %,
respectively. In addition, feed ratios of cross-linker can also take
effect on the hydrogel formation. At the same pH condition and gelator
concentration (pH 2.0, 10 wt %), when the molar ratio between the
remaining acylhydrazine groups from P1 and the aldehyde
groups from PEGDA decreases from 2.10:1 to 1.05:1, only
viscous liquid was obtained. However, hydrogel was formed slowly and
showed low mechanical strength when increasing the molar ratio to
3.15:1. Thus, we assume that the optimal ratio of acylhydrazine/aldehyde
is about 2.10:1 to form the necessary cross-linking density for gelation.

To verify
the acylhydrazone bond formation within hydrogels, the
IR spectra of P1, PEGDA, and hydrogels were
recorded by attenuated total reflection Fourier transformed infrared
(ATR-FTIR) spectrometry (Figure 3b). For PEGDA, absorption band at 1683
cm–1 was attributed to the stretching vibration
of the aldehyde group. Appearance of the C=N characteristic
band at 1674 cm–1 in the spectrum of GEL1 confirmed the cross-linking reaction between the acylhydrazine groups
from P1 and the aldehyde groups from PEGDA to form hydrazone bonds. Also compared with the spectrum of P1, the characteristic peak ascribed to the amino group weakened
in the spectrum of GEL1, demonstrating the acylhydrazine
groups were consumed. These results indicate that the hydrogels were
formed through hydrazone cross-linking reaction. Internal morphology
of the hydrogels was analyzed by SEM. As shown in Figures 3c and S8, the SEM image revealed that GEL1 and GEL3 composed of 3D porous interconnected microstructure with
pore sizes in the range from 20 to 50 μm.

To further investigate
the viscoelastic behavior of these hydrogels,
dynamic rheology measurements at both frequency sweep and strain sweep
modes were performed on a rotational rheometer. In the frequency sweep
test, G′ and G″ of
hydrogel samples were measured with a range of frequencies from 0.1
to 100 rad s–1 at controlled regular strain of 10%.
The rheological curves of G′ and G″ of GEL1 and GEL2 from pH 2 buffer,
as well as GEL3 from pH 4 buffer, are shown in Figure 3d. G′ exceeds G″ by about 1 order of magnitude,
and G′ is independent of oscillatory frequency,
exhibiting a plateau in a wide frequency region. These are characteristics
for strong polymer gels with covalent cross-linked networks. For hydrogels GEL1 and GEL2 with different gelator concentrations
(15 and 10 wt %, respectively), G′ of the
former was 4.5 kPa, which is larger than that of the latter (3.0 kPa),
indicating that a high gelator concentration enhances the mechanical
performance. In addition, G′ of GEL1 (pH 2.0) and GEL3 (pH 4.0) formed from the same gelator
concentrations but in different pH make even large difference. The
latter is 12.0 kPa, in contrast to the former (4.5 kPa), indicating
too acidic condition (pH 2.0) is not favorable for acylhydrazone formation,
which weakens the cross-linking network. As shown in Figure S9 in the strain sweep, the breaking shear stain of GEL3 (70%) is higher than that of GEL1 (100%),
suggesting that GEL3 showed better toughness. All these
could be attributed to the enhanced cleavage of acylhydrazone linkages
at strong acidic condition.

A key characteristic of dynamic
covalent networks is their self-healing
ability. The self-healing properties of dendronized hyperbranched
hydrogels were investigated by using two hydrogels colored differently.
As shown in Figure 4, two disks of hydrogels were cut into two halves and placed together
at room temperature. After 30 min, the two pieces of the gels rejoined
into one piece, and the crack at the cutting site disappeared. The
healed hydrogel could be lifted against its own weight. These support
the excellent self-healing ability of the dynamic covalent hydrogels,
which should have originated from the dynamic nature of the acylhydrazone
exchange between the acylhydrazine and aldehydes within the hydrogel
network. Acylhydrazone bonds can dynamically break and regenerate,
with the dissociation rate constant controlling the acylhydrazone
exchange reaction, resulting in healing of the gel.

Figure 4 Self-healing of GEL1 at room temperature. One of them
is colored with disperse red 1 (DR1) for clarity.

Furthermore, inheriting from the dendronized hyperbranched
poly(acylhydrazone)
precursors, these hydrogels also show thermoresponsive properties.
They are transparent at room temperature but become opaque when heating
to elevated temperature, which was followed by using temperature-varied
UV–vis spectroscopy. Typical transmittance curves are shown
in Figure 5. The Tcps for GEL1, GEL2, GEL3, and GEL4 are 35.8, 36.4, 37.2,
and 37.0 °C, respectively, which are much lower compared to their
corresponding polymer precursors in aqueous solutions. This decrease
is attributed to the high polymer concentration within hydrogels and
also high concentration of OEG dendrons in vicinity, which enhances
the aggregation kinetics for collapsed dendrons. Furthermore, the
hydrophilic peripheral acylhydrazines were consumed during the cross-linking
reaction, resulting also in more hydrophobic polymer networks. However,
the phase transition span for the hydrogels (ΔT > 5 °C) is much wider than that of the corresponding polymers
(ΔT < 2 °C). This should be because
the network within the hydrogels inhibits the mobility of polymer
chains, resulting in lower aggregation kinetics of collapsed OEG dendrons
compared to free polymer chains in solutions. Notably, Tcps of these hydrogels were not affected obviously by
pH or concentration, suggesting that the collapsed dendritic OEGs
fixed in the vicinity within the cross-linked network dominate efficiently
the aggregation of polymer chains. All hydrogels show Tcp around physiological temperature, which make them suitable
candidates for bioapplications.

for GEL1, GEL2, GEL3, and GEL4. Inset: photographs
of GEL1 below and above Tcp, respectively.

It was reported that
the mechanical properties of the thermoresponsive
hydrogels were tuned by temperature.30,31 The temperature-dependent
rheological properties of these hyperbranched polymers were investigated. GEL1 is taken as an example, and its G′
and G″ as functions of temperature from 25
to 50 °C are plotted in Figure S10. At low temperatures, G′ shows a minor change
with decrease of temperature, whereas a significant decrease starts
at about 33 °C, which is close to the volume transition temperature
of the corresponding hydrogel. At 40 °C, G′
decreased to ∼570 Pa. We suppose that this is due to the thermally
induced dehydration of the hydrogel. When the temperature was higher
than the volume transition temperature of the hydrogel, the hydrogel
became heterogeneous and the water moved to the surface of the hydrogels
through oscillation. Similar phenomenon has also been reported with
other thermoresponsive dynamic hydrogels.32

3 Conclusions
The novel dendronized hyperbranched
poly(acylhydrazones) were efficiently
prepared through A2 + B3 one-step strategy.
These polymers exhibit characteristic constitutional dynamics, thermoresponsive
behavior, and low cytotoxicity. Their thermally induced phase transitions
can be tuned not only by solution pH but also by the branched architecture
and addition of a third component. The surplus acylhydrazine units
within the polymer periphery provide a chance for further modification
to form functional materials. Cross-linking of these hyperbranched
polymers with dialdehyde cross-linkers via dynamic covalent chemistry
leads to the formation of hydrogels with macroporous morphology. These
hydrogels exhibit excellent mechanical properties and self-healing
ability, as well as temperature and pH responsive behaviors. The phase-transition
temperatures of these biocompatible hydrogels are in the vicinity
of physiological temperature, which makes them promising candidates
for biomedical applications.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Hydrazine hydrate, nitrilotriacetic
acid, and glutaraldehyde were purchased from TCI (Japan). Thionyl
chloride (SOCl2) and methanol (MeOH) were purchased from
Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Other reagents and solvents were
purchased at reagent grade and used without further purification.
Merck KGaA TLC Silica gel 60 F254 were used for thin-layer chromatography
(TLC) analysis. Silica gel 60 M (Macherey-Nagel, 0.04–0.063
mm, 200–300 mesh) was used as the stationary phase for column
chromatography. A2 and A2′ monomer bearing
dendritic oligoethylene glycol (OEG) units24 and the cross-linker poly(ethylene glycol) dibenzyl aldehyde (PEGDA)33 were synthesized according to our previous works.

4.2 Instrumentation and Measurements
1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker
AV 500 (1H: 500 MHz, 13C: 125 MHz) spectrometer,
and chemical shifts are reported as values (ppm) relative to internal
Me4Si. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measurements
were carried out on a Waters GPC e2695 instrument with 3 column set
(Styragel HR3 + HR4 + HR5) equipped with a refractive index detector
(Waters 2414) and N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF) (containing 1 gL–1 LiBr) as eluent at 45 °C.
Multiangle light-scattering detector (Wyatt Technology Corporation,
Dawn EOS 243-E) was used for the measurements. The calibration was
performed with poly(methyl methacrylate) standards in the range of Mp = 2580–981 000 (Polymer Standards
Service-USA Inc.). UV–vis turbidity measurements were carried
out on a PE UV–vis spectrophotometer (Lambda 35) equipped with
a thermocontrolled bath. Polymer aqueous solutions were placed in
a spectrophotometer (path length 1 cm) and heated or cooled at different
ramping rates. Absorptions of the solution at λ = 700 nm were
recorded per 5 s. Cloud point (Tcp) is
determined to be the one at which the transmittance at λ = 700
nm reached 50% of its initial value. The pH was measured with a Mettler-Toledo
SevenCompact 220 pH meter and an InLab Flex-Micro semi-microelectrode
(after 3 points calibration at pH 7.00, 4.01, and 2.00). Rheological
experiments were performed on a Discovery HR-3 rheometer from TA Instruments
with 12 mm diameter parallel plates at room temperature. The hydrogels
disks (12 mm in diameter and polymer concentration at 10 and 15 wt
%, respectively) were measured with the frequency test. The SEM studies
were carried out by using a HITACHI SU-1510 instrument. After rendering
conductive with a platinum coated on the cross section of lyophilized
hydrogels, the morphologies of the samples were detected.

4.3 Synthesis of Dendronized Hyperbranched Poly(acylhydrazones)
Condensation polymerization of monomers with different molar ratios
was carried out in a pH 4 buffer solution at room temperature. The
mixture was vigorously stirred for 24 h and then dialyzed against
deionized water for 5 days using a dialysis bag (MWCO, 8–14
kDa), followed by lyophilization to give the polymer in a white solid.

4.4 Preparation of Hydrogels
P1 stock solution with a certain concentration was prepared and the
cross-linker PEGDA was added at room temperature to afford a hydrogel.
In a typical procedure for the preparation of GEL1, a
15 wt % P1 stock solution was obtained by dissolving
30 mg of P1 in 0.2 mL pH 2 buffer solution in a 4 mL
vial. A 15 wt % PEGDA stock solution was obtained by dissolving 15
mg of the cross-linker PEGDA in 0.1 mL of pH 2 buffer solution. Then,
the PEGDA solution was added to the P1 solution and a
transparent gel with a bright yellow color was obtained after several
minutes. The self-healing properties of the hydrogels were then investigated
by taking the GEL1 as an example. Two hydrogel disks,
with one of them colored with disperse red 1 (DR1), were prepared.
A drop of DR1 solution was added to P1 stock solution
and the cross-linker PEGDA was then added at room temperature to afford
a colored hydrogel.

4.5 In Vitro Cytotoxicity
Cytotoxicity
of dendronized hyperbranched poly(acylhydrazones) to HeLa cell lines
was determined by cell-counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay (Dojindo Laboratories,
Japan). These cells were seeded in two 96-well tissue culture plates,
respectively, at a concentration of 1000 cells/well in 100 μL
culture medium. The cells were cultured overnight at 37 °C in
a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Then, the cells were
incubated with different concentrations of hyperbranched poly(acylhydrazones)
aqueous solution (2 μL) for 48 h. Ten microliters of a CCK-8
solution was added to each well and the cells were incubated for another
2 h in a tissue culture incubator. The absorbance was then measured
at 450 nm using a microplate reader. Relative cell viability = [(As – Ab)]/[(Ac – Ab)]
× 100%. (As: sample, Ac: control, Ab: blank).
