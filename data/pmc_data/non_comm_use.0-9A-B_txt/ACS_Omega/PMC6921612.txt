Cytoplasm of Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cells contains a significant amount of desired intracellular
products for both industrial utility and academic research. To recover
intracellular compounds, it is necessary to break the yeast cells
with high efficiency, which, under certain circumstances, requires
the use of the lytic enzyme zymolyase to completely digest the cell
walls. A promising strategy for zymolyase immobilization on silk fibroin
(SF) was developed. SF/Fe3O4 magnetic microspheres
(MMs) were constructed by solvent (ethanol)-induced self-assembly
of SF surrounding Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles
(MNs), which were synthesized by a coprecipitation method. Zymolyase
was covalently bonded on the surface of the SF/Fe3O4 MMs by a photochemical cross-linking method to produce robust
biocatalysts of zymolyase/SF/Fe3O4. The chemical,
magnetic, and morphological properties of the MM supports and the
immobilized zymolyase were investigated. Enzymolysis results demonstrated
that the immobilized zymolyase showed good activity and stability
for digesting yeast cell walls, and the biocatalyst can be readily
recycled through convenient magnetic separation for reuse. At the
optimum pH = 7.5, the immobilized zymolyase maintained 84% of the
activity of the free zymolyase and retained 41% of its initial activity
after four times of reuse. At unfavorable acidic pH = 4, the immobilized
zymolyase retained 81% of its initial activity, while the free zymolyase
showed no significant activity. Consequently, the SF/Fe3O4 MMs exhibit superior performance in terms of immobilizing
enzymes, which have a good prospect in the biological application.

==== Body
Introduction
Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) has a significant
industrial utility.
Because the cellular structure and functional organization of S. cerevisiae are similar to those of plant and animal
cells, it is one of the most intensively studied unicellular eukaryotic
model organisms in biological research.1 Cytoplasm of S. cerevisiae is a rich
source of bioproducts (such as proteins, polysaccharides, and so on)
valuable in biotechnology and pharmacology, as well as in the food
industry. Recovery of the intracellular products requires efficient
disruption of the yeast cells. For example, thanks to its genetic
tractability, short generation time, and easy cultivation, S. cerevisiae has been widely used for the expression
of recombinant posttranslationally modified proteins. Many recombinant
proteins expressed in S. cerevisiae remain intracellular and need to be released by disrupting the yeast
cells.2 However, S. cerevisiae has a relatively thick and rigid cell wall consisting of β-glucan,
mannan, and glycoprotein, which is notoriously difficult to break.3 Various methods have been reported, such as freeze/thawing,
high-frequency focused and conventional (ultra)sonication, high-pressure
homogenization, osmotic shock, bead milling, and chemical or enzymatic
lysis.2,4 For laboratory-scale cell disruption for
intracellular protein recovery, the enzymatic and chemical lysis methods
are commonly used. For enzymatic lysis, zymolyase accumulated from Arthrobacter luteus (A. luteus) culture is a mixture of lytic enzymes, including β-1,3-glucanase,
mannose, and protease, and can readily degrade viable yeast cell walls
at all growth stages under mild reaction conditions.5

However, practical applications of native zymolyase
are seriously
limited by its high sensitivity to environmental conditions, unsatisfactory
operational and storage stability, low marginal lifetime, lack of
(re)-purification, difficulties in recovery, and reusability.6,7 Immobilization of enzymes on supports/carriers has been most commonly
used to improve the efficiency of enzymes for industrial utilizations.
The effect of immobilization depends upon the supports and immobilization
procedure.8−11 Particularly, iron oxide (Fe3O4) magnetic
nanoparticles (MNs) have attracted a great deal of interest in enzyme
immobilization as they provide a facile and effective separation of
enzymes from the biocatalytic reaction mixture by use of external
magnetic fields and thereby recovery of the enzymes for continual
uses.12 Generally, bare Fe3O4 MNs have a tendency to aggregate and are sensitive to oxidation
and acidic conditions, which hinder their practical applications.
Active groups on Fe3O4 MNs are limited, which
results in incompetence of naked Fe3O4 MNs for
direct attachment of enzymes. At this junction, functionalization
on the surface of Fe3O4 MNs is a promising strategy.
A range of natural polymers with various functional groups have been
developed to modify Fe3O4 MNs.13−17

Silk fibroin (SF) derived from Bombyx mori is an abundant sustainable biopolymer with more than 480,000 tons
per year produced all over the world. SF exhibits an impressive versatile
processability and good ability to be functionalized.18 Particularly, SF has been investigated in the field of
enzyme immobilization.19,20 In our previous studies, SF-based
hydrogels were fabricated for immobilization of several industrially
important enzymes; the immobilized enzymes displayed a wide-working
pH range, as well as recyclability.21−25 In addition, several methods have been developed
to prepare SF-coated MNs.26,27 For instance, Chen
and co-workers fabricated Fe2O3/SF nanoparticles.26 Huang and co-workers fabricated Fe3O4/SF nanoparticles with irregular structures.27 Lu and co-workers fabricated core–shell
Fe3O4/SF microspheres with controllable homogeneous
size and water dispersibility by a one-step solvothermal process.28 Tian et al. prepared Fe3O4/SF nanoparticles by a one-step potassium phosphate salting-out process.29 These SF-based MNs of many pioneering works
have been widely used in biomedical applications such as drug delivery
and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).30 Despite the progress on SF/Fe3O4 magnetic
materials, their application in enzyme immobilization and development
of an efficient method to achieve high performances has a substantial
demand.31

Herein, we aimed to explore
the possibility of covalently immobilizing
zymolyase on SF/Fe3O4 magnetic microspheres
(ZY/SF/Fe3O4) for effectively disrupting S. cerevisiae yeast cells. The proposed process is
schematically illustrated in Figure 1. First, Fe3O4 MNs were synthesized
through coprecipitation of ferrous (Fe2+) and ferric (Fe3+) ions in a basic aqueous medium.32,33 The obtained Fe3O4 MNs can be uniformly dispersed
in ethanol and water. Then, through a controllable ethanol-induced
interface self-assembly,26,34 SF embedded the Fe3O4 MNs, forming SF/Fe3O4 MMs.
Subsequently, the abundant tyrosine residues of SF were employed for
immobilization of zymolyase through Ru(II)-mediated photochemical
cross-linking reactions between the phenyl groups of SF and zymolyase,
initiated by ammonium persulfate (APS). Thus, zymolyase was covalently
bonded on the surface of the SF/Fe3O4 MMs, obtaining
the ZY/SF/Fe3O4. It is of note that the SF not
only served as a matrix for enzyme immobilization but also served
as a protective layer for the Fe3O4 MNs. Owing
to a large amount of serine residues (hydroxyl groups) in SF, SF stabilized
the Fe3O4 MNs through electrostatic adsorption
and hydrogen bonding interactions, preventing aggregation and avoiding
corrosion or oxidation in subsequent reaction media. The resultant
materials were examined by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS),
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), vibrating sample magnetometers (VSM),
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) equipped with energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The activity
of the immobilized zymolyase on cell disruption was evaluated by enzymolysis
assays via measurement of UV–vis spectroscopy. The cell disruption
kinetics was also investigated.

nanoparticles and the mechanism of zymolyase disrupting yeast cell
walls.

Results and Discussion
Crystalline Structure Analysis
The XRD patterns of
Fe3O4, SF/Fe3O4, and ZY/SF/Fe3O4 (Figure 2a) exhibited the same diffraction peaks, which could be assigned
to characteristic peaks of the standard Fe3O4 (PDF#85-1436) compiled by the International Center for Diffraction
Data (ICDD). The peaks at 2θ values of 30.1, 35.4, 37.1, 43.1,
53.4, 57.0, and 62.6° were indexed as (220), (311), (222), (400),
(422), (511), and (440) planes of the phase pure spinel structure
of Fe3O4, respectively.35 On one hand, the crystalline structure of Fe3O4 did not change after being embedded in SF/Fe3O4.31 On the other hand, new peaks at 2θ
= 20.2° ascribed to SF appeared in SF/Fe3O4 and ZY/SF/Fe3O4, indicating that SF was successfully
coated on Fe3O4. Specifically, TGA results showed
that the contents of Fe3O4 in SF/Fe3O4 and ZY/SF/Fe3O4 were 39.0 ±
1.1 and 46.3 ± 0.1%, respectively (Figure S1).

DLS curves.

Chemical Composition
The FTIR spectra of Fe3O4, SF/Fe3O4, and ZY/SF/Fe3O4 are displayed in Figure 2b. The characteristic peak of Fe3O4 was at 605 cm–1.36 The
characteristic peaks of SF were at 1650, 1525, and 1240 cm–1, belonging to β-sheets, typical secondary structures of regenerated
SF.21 In the spectra of SF/Fe3O4 and ZY/SF/Fe3O4, both Fe3O4 and SF were observed, also indicating that SF
was successfully coated on Fe3O4.37 The chemical composition of SF/Fe3O4 and ZY/SF/Fe3O4 was further confirmed
by EDS analysis (Figure S2), showing existence
of the elements Fe, O, C, and N. The appearance of C and N signals
observed in SF/Fe3O4 and ZY/SF/Fe3O4 may be originated from SF and the immobilized zymolyase,
also indicating that SF was successfully coated onto the surface of
Fe3O4. EDS mapping analysis also demonstrated
homogeneous distribution of Fe and thereby Fe3O4 in SF/Fe3O4 and ZY/SF/Fe3O4.

Magnetic Properties
The magnetic hysteresis loops of
Fe3O4, SF/Fe3O4, and ZY/SF/Fe3O4 exhibited low coercivity and small hysteresis
(Figure 2c). The saturation
magnetization values (at H = 4000 Oe) of Fe3O4, SF/Fe3O4, and ZY/SF/Fe3O4 were 1180, 91.1, and 53.8 Gs, respectively, indicating
that all of the samples possessed magnetic responsiveness.31 The saturation magnetization decreased after
SF coating and zymolyase immobilization. This phenomenon can be explained
by the presence of SF layers around Fe3O4, as
revealed by larger sizes of SF/Fe3O4 (∼2157
nm) and ZY/SF/Fe3O4 (∼1289 nm) than that
of Fe3O4 (∼479 nm). It is of note that
hydrodynamic sizes determined by DLS (Figure 2d) might differ from particle sizes measured
by other techniques such as TEM and SEM. Nevertheless, ZY/SF/Fe3O4 could be quickly separated from the reaction
mixtures by magnets and rapidly redispersed when the magnetic field
disappeared. The sensitive magnetic responsivity and redispersibility
implied that ZY/SF/Fe3O4 possessed advantageous
properties for magnetic manipulation as biocatalysts.

Morphology Analysis
The SEM images of Fe3O4, SF/Fe3O4, and ZY/SF/Fe3O4 are represented in Figure 3a–c, respectively. Fe3O4 displayed roughly spherical structures. SF/Fe3O4 was larger than Fe3O4, suggesting
that the Fe3O4 MNs were embedded into the SF
microsphere. Thanks to the distinct density contrast, TEM images might
be easy to differentiate the samples. The TEM images of Fe3O4, SF/Fe3O4, and ZY/SF/Fe3O4 are depicted in Figure 3d–f, respectively. After self-assembly of SF
on Fe3O4, SF/Fe3O4 MMs
comprising Fe3O4 (black) and thin SF layers
(gray) were observed. The images confirmed a uniform fine spherical
shape of SF/Fe3O4 and ZY/SF/Fe3O4. ZY/SF/Fe3O4 was denser and larger
than SF/Fe3O4. The TEM observation was consistent
with those of SEM.

SF/Fe3O4, and ZY/SF/Fe3O4. Representative (a–c) SEM images and (d–f) TEM images.

Immobilization Efficiency
The immobilization capacity
and efficiency would be affected by many factors, including reaction
time, pH, temperature, concentration of zymolyase, and activation
of chemical bonds on both SF and zymolyase. In the present study,
zymolyase was immobilized on the SF/Fe3O4 MMs
via cross-linking of tyrosine residues into dityrosine adducts. The
presence of tyrosine residues in both SF25 and zymolyase were confirmed by amino acid analysis (Table 1). Following immobilization
of zymolyase on SF/Fe3O4, the loading capacity
was determined using the classical Bradford protein assay, showing
an immobilization efficiency of almost 100% at a loading amount of
100 mg·g–1. Furthermore, as the immobilization
of zymolyase occurs via covalent bonds, no leaching of zymolyase was
observed.

Enzymatic Activity
During lysis of viable yeast cells,
turbidity of the reaction mixture decreased with time and became approximately
constant after 2 h. At 0.5 h intervals, the number of yeast cells
was counted (Figure 4a). In the case of free zymolyase, as the enzyme concentration increased
from 0.1 to 1.0 mg·mL–1, no significant change
in either reaction rate or product yield was observed (Figure S3a). As pH influenced the lytic activity
considerably, the effect of pH on the free zymolyase was examined
(Figure 4b). The optimum
pH of the free zymolyase was pH = 7–8. High lytic activities
were detected at pH = 9–10. However, only weak lytic activity
was observed at pH = 6; almost no lytic activity was detected at pH
≤ 5. Compared with the free enzyme, the immobilized enzyme
usually exhibited reduced activity.12,22,38,39 Thus, a comparative
investigation between the free and immobilized zymolyase was conducted
in terms of pH in the range of 4–10. At pH = 7.5, the immobilized
zymolyase maintained 84% of the activity of the free zymolyase. The
immobilized zymolyase maintained a relatively high activity over 4–6.
At pH = 4, the immobilized zymolyase retained 81% of its initial activity,
which was higher than that of the free zymolyase. The tolerance to
unfavorable acidic pH of zymolyase had been significantly enhanced
after immobilization.

Kinetic Parameters
It should be noted that, in our
previous studies on enzymes immobilized in SF-based hydrogels, deviation
of the kinetic data from a first-order equation to an “S”-shaped
curve was observed. The change in the kinetic properties of enzymes
was mainly attributed to the mass transfer limitations.22 In the present study, zymolyase immobilized
on SF/Fe3O4 MMs showed higher activities than
that on SF-based hydrogels under the same condition (Figure S3b), yet the enzymolysis data fit well with the first-order
kinetic expression. To further understand the zymolyase activity,
Michaelis–Menten kinetics of yeast cell disruption was measured
at different initial substrate concentrations. The kinetic parameters
for the free and immobilized zymolyase were calculated from the Lineweaver–Burk
plots (Figure 4c). Km values for the free and immobilized zymolyase
were 1.0 × 105 and 1.4 × 104 cfu·mL–1, respectively. Kcat/Km for the free zymolyase was 0.44 L·g–1·h–1, whereas that of the immobilized
zymolyase was 0.34 L·g–1·h–1. The slight decrease might be caused by a possible structural change
and conformational hindrance of the active sites after immobilization
of zymolyase on SF/Fe3O4.12,38,39 Reusability of the immobilized zymolyase
was also evaluated. ZY/SF/Fe3O4 could be magnetically
separated, recovered, and retained 41% of its initial activity after
four consecutive cycles (Figure 4d). This observation demonstrated an improved reusability
of ZY/SF/Fe3O4, which was crucial and attractive
for practical application in digesting yeast cell walls.

Conclusions
SF MM-embedded Fe3O4 MNs were prepared as
effective magnetic carriers for enzyme immobilization. Zymolyase was
used as a model enzyme and was successfully immobilized on SF/Fe3O4. The SF/Fe3O4 MMs exhibited
high immobilization efficiency and a capacity reaching 100 mg·g–1. Compared with the free zymolyase, the immobilized
zymolyase exhibited good biocatalytic activity for disruption of S. cerevisiae cells in a wide range of pH. Moreover,
the saturation magnetization value of ZY/SF/Fe3O4 was 53.8 Gs, which allowed reuse of the immobilized zymolyase by
magnetic treatment. The results validated that the SF MMs are promising
platforms for enzyme immobilization with high performance. Through
the introduction of Fe3O4 MNs and immobilization
of zymolyase, this study provides an effective strategy to further
improve the performance of SF-based materials.

Experimental Section
Materials
Zymolyase from A. luteus was purchased from Nacalai Tesque, Inc. (Japan). Sodium hydroxide
(NaOH; 98%), ferrous chloride (FeCl2·4H2O; 98%) and ferric chloride (FeCl3·6H2O; 99%) were purchased from Macklin. Ammonium persulfate (APS) and
tris(2,2′-bipyridyl)dichlororuthenium(II) hexahydrate ([Ru(bpy)3]2+Cl–2·6H2O) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Analytical reagent grade
calcium chloride (CaCl2), sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), absolute ethanol (CH3CH2OH),
and all other reagents were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent
Beijing Co. Ltd. The water used in all experiments was deionized water
unless otherwise stated. All assays were performed in triplicate and
data reported as average ± standard deviation.

Yeast Cell Preparations
S. cerevisiae YS58 yeast cells were kindly supplied by Dr. Junfeng Liu (Beijing
University of Chemical Technology). Cells were grown batch-wise in
medium (glucose 2.0%, peptone 2.0%, and pH 5.5) at 30 °C for
2 days with shaking at 180 rpm. The cells were collected, resuspended
in 1/15 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), and used as a substrate for the
determination of lytic activity.

Measurement of Lytic Activity of Zymolyase
An appropriate
amount of enzyme (10 mg·mL–1, 10 μL)
was added to 200 μL of yeast suspension, and the change of absorbance
at 620 nm was monitored. The reaction mixture was incubated at 25
°C for 2 h with gentle shaking. The turbidity of the reaction
mixture and the number of intact cells in the mixture were determined
after different time periods (t). Lysis of yeast
cells was expressed as the percentage decrease in optical density
(OD) at 620 nm and/or in cell number. In the control experiments,
phosphate buffer was used instead of an enzyme solution, and clearing
of cytoplasmic contents (cell wall lysis) because of autolysis was
measured. The data of the free zymolyase was fitted to first-order
rate kinetics to determine the apparent rate constant Kcat/Km, where Kcat is the turnover number and Km is the Michaelis constant. The activity of the immobilized
zymolyase was assayed using the same method. 1   2   3   4   5   6  

Preparation of Regenerated SF and SF-Based Hydrogels
Regenerated SF and chemically cross-linked SF-based hydrogels were
prepared as previously described.21−25 Briefly, raw silk (produced in Zhejiang, China) was
degummed in 0.05 wt % Na2CO3 at 90 °C for
90 min and rinsed thoroughly with deionized water. The degummed silk
was dissolved in a solution of CaCl2/CH3CH2OH/H2O (with a molar ratio of 1:2:8) at 60 °C
for 2 h and then collected by centrifuging at 8000 rpm for 12 min
at 4 °C. The supernatant was dialyzed against deionized water
using a cellulose dialysis membrane (MWCO 3500 Da) for 3 days and
then lyophilized to obtain regenerated SF. SF (40 mg) was solubilized
in 186 μL of PBS. APS (10 μL, 1 M) and [Ru(bpy)3]2+Cl–2 (4 μL, 20 mM)
solutions were then added. The mixture was irradiated for 10 min using
a 100 W fiber optical white light source placed 4 cm away. For zymolyase
immobilization in the SF-based hydrogels, the procedure was the same
except that SF was replaced with a mixture of SF and zymolyase.

Synthesis of Fe3O4 Magnetic Nanoparticles
The Fe3O4 nanoparticles were prepared by
a coprecipitation method.32,33 An aqueous solution
of FeCl3 was mixed with a hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution
of FeCl2 at Fe3+:Fe2+ = 2:1. To the
mixture, the NaOH solution was added drop by drop with continuous
stirring at 40 °C. When pH was adjusted to 10, a black precipitate
appeared, which was kept for 30 min. The precipitate was washed three
times with distilled water to remove excess NaOH and any impurity.
The precipitate was further washed with ethanol and vacuum-dried (50
°C) for further use.

Preparation of Regenerated SF Microsphere-Embedded Fe3O4 Magnetic Nanoparticles
The vacuum-dried nanoparticles
were redispersed in absolute ethanol. A certain amount of the above
dispersion was added dropwise to 10% (w/w) RSF solutions (v/v = 3/20)
under continuous gentle stirring at room temperature over 2 min. The
mixture was incubated in a refrigerator at −20 °C for
24 h. Then, the frozen sample was defrosted. After centrifugation,
followed by washing with water three times and by lyophilizing with
a freezing dryer, stable microspheres (denoted as SF/Fe3O4) were separated using a magnet.34,40

Immobilization of Zymolyase on Regenerated SF Microsphere-Embedded
Fe3O4 Magnetic Nanoparticles
The magnetic
SF microspheres (1.8 mg) were dispersed in 164 μL of phosphate
buffer solution (1/15 M, pH = 7.5) with dissolved 20 μL of zymolyase
(10 mg·mL–1). Following addition of APS (12
μL, 1 M) and [Ru(bpy)3]2+Cl–2 (4 μL, 20 mM), the solution was irradiated with
white light. The resultant microspheres (denoted as ZY/SF/Fe3O4) were separated by magnetic separation and washed thoroughly
with deionized water to remove remaining reagents, while the supernatant
was kept to investigate the remaining content of zymolyase by the
Bradford protein assay as previously described.22 Immobilization efficiency (IE) was calculated by the following
equation 7  

Amino Acid Analysis
Zymolyase was completely hydrolyzed
in concentrated HNO3 and used for amino acid analysis (Hitachi
L-8900, Japan).

UV–Vis Spectroscopy
The absorbance was measured
on a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2600, Japan).

X-Ray Diffraction Analysis
Powder X-ray diffraction
analysis (Shimadzu XRD-6000, Japan) was recorded in the range of 5–90°
at a scan rate of 5° min–1 with CuK α
radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm).

Thermal Gravimetric Analysis
TGA (TGA/DSC3, METTLER
TOLEDO, USA) were measured under nitrogen atmosphere in a temperature
range of 20–600 °C. The chemical composition was calculated
according to the following equations 8   9   10  

Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
The FTIR spectra
were obtained using an FTIR spectrometer (Bruker Optics VERTEX 70,
USA) in the transmission mode in the range of 400–4000 cm–1 with a resolution of 4 cm–1 at
room temperature.

Vibrating Sample Magnetometers
Magnetic properties
were investigated by a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM, BKT-4500,
Beijing, China). The magnetic hysteresis curves were recorded at room
temperature, in which the magnetism of materials could be characterized
by parameters such as the saturation magnetization (Ms), the remanence (Mr), and
the coercivity (Hc).

Dynamic Light Scattering
Particle size distribution
was measured by DLS (Zetasizer Nano ZS90, Malvern Instruments, UK).

Scanning Electron Microscopy
The hydrogel samples were
shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen and lyophilized. The obtained samples
were fractured and coated with gold for SEM observation using a scanning
electron microscope (Hitachi Regulus8100, Japan).

Transmission Electron Microscopy
For TEM experiments
(Hitachi H-800, Japan), samples were dispersed in absolute ethanol
and prepared by evaporating a droplet of the dispersion on a Cu grid.
