Scaling
graphene from a two-dimensional (2D) ideal structure to
a three-dimensional (3D) millimeter-sized architecture without compromising
its remarkable electrical, optical, and thermal properties is currently
a great challenge to overcome the limitations of integrating single
graphene flakes into 3D devices. Herewith, highly connected and continuous
nanoporous graphene (NPG) samples, with electronic and vibrational
properties very similar to those of suspended graphene layers, are
presented. We pinpoint the hallmarks of 2D ideal graphene scaled in
these 3D porous architectures by combining the state-of-the-art spectromicroscopy
and imaging techniques. The connected and bicontinuous topology, without
frayed borders and edges and with low density of crystalline defects,
has been unveiled via helium ion, Raman, and transmission electron
microscopies down to the atomic scale. Most importantly, nanoscanning
photoemission unravels a 3D NPG structure with preserved 2D electronic
density of states (Dirac cone like) throughout the porous sample.
Furthermore, the high spatial resolution brings to light the interrelationship
between the topology and the morphology in the wrinkled and highly
bent regions, where distorted sp2 C bonds, associated with
sp3-like hybridization state, induce small energy gaps.
This highly connected graphene structure with a 3D skeleton overcomes
the limitations of small-sized individual graphene sheets and opens
a new route for a plethora of applications of the 2D graphene properties
in 3D devices.

Introduction
Graphene is undoubtedly
emerging as one of the most promising nanomaterials
with high electron mobility, high thermal conductivity, and high tensile
strength,1 opening a new perspective for
technological applications ranging from electronics to optics, plasmonics,
sensors, and biodevices. Recent years have witnessed many breakthroughs
in research on graphene, as well as a significant advance in its mass
production. Graphene can revolutionize industrial applications when
large-area sheets with the same outstanding performance as the ideal
suspended graphene are realized. It maximizes the surface area per
weight but, for many devices, it is useful to pack the individual
two-dimensional (2D) flakes into a three-dimensional (3D) arrangement
to minimize the volume while increasing its surface area. The employment
of a single graphene sheet in 3D devices is not straightforward, and
a strong research effort is oriented toward the design of such 3D
architectures,2−4 preserving the remarkable electronic, optical, and
transport properties of suspended 2D sheets. The design challenges
of 3D nanoporous graphene (NPG) structures are focused on enhancing
the surface active areas and on ensuring a topological structure with
highly connected layers and negligible density of lattice and edge
defects, to engineer physical and chemical properties for the desired
functionalities.4,5 A number of methods have been
employed to prepare graphene in 3D architectures,6−8 but the undesired
density of crystal and topological defects may strongly reduce the
electrical and thermal conductivities and influence the operation
of electronic devices.

High interconnectivity, low defect density,
and tunable nanopore
sizes can be obtained by growing high-quality 3D NPG by means of Ni-based
chemical vapor deposition (CVD).3 These
NPG samples are not constituted by an assembly of graphene flakes,
but they contain thousands of suspended graphene planes stacked in
a small volume, with a high crystalline order, continuously interconnected
in the 3D space, and decorated with pores in the 0.2–2 μm
scale,3 and they can be an ideal prototype
to engineer highly responsive electronic devices.9,10 The
realization of 2D graphene millimeter-sized samples with a large surface
area (1200 m2/g)3 into a 3D
skeleton overcomes the limitations of the small-scale size of individual
graphene flakes11 and can pave a new route
for technological applications, if the outstanding 2D electronic properties
of graphene are retained in the 3D NPG samples.

In this work,
we demonstrate with a precise electronic characterization
of 3D NPG, by combining high energy and spatially resolved photoelectron
and Raman spectroscopy at the submicrometer scale, that the 2D Dirac
cone electronic spectral density is dominant in the 3D nanoarchitecture.
Nowadays, Raman microscopy is widely recognized as one of the most
powerful methods to assess the quality of graphene and carbon-based
materials, as it allows to identify the number of interconnected layers,
the stacking, the orientation, the density of defects, and the nature
of edges, strain, and doping.12−14 Rarely, it has been combined
with the state-of-the-art nanoimaging photoemission, sensitive to
the electronic structure and to the degree of hybridization, to achieve
an all-round and detailed correlation between the electronic, dynamical,
and structural properties in carbon-based systems. Herewith, we will
employ nanoscanning photoemission at even higher spatial resolution
than that of Raman microscopy, to carefully image the degree of sp2 hybridization proper of graphene
and, most importantly, the spectral density at the Fermi level as
a function of the NPG topology. We exploit the potentialities of these
spatially resolved state-of-the-art spectromicroscopies to locally
identify in the 3D structure the hallmarks (deviations) of the 2D
graphene electronic and vibrational properties as a function of the
topology. In particular, the C 1s core level associated with the pure
sp2 hybridization is accompanied with distorted bonds associated
to an sp3-like configuration in the wrinkled regions. The
accurate control of the electronic state mapping, strictly associated
with the morphology of NPG, shows a dominant linear slope of the spectral
density of states (DOS) close to the Fermi level with a tiny gap in
the wrinkled regions. Moreover, the average electronic response of
3D NPG samples has been firmly established as preserving the 2D graphene
properties, corroborating that these 3D NPG architectures can be elected
as favorite candidates to integrate and engineer 2D graphene in 3D
devices.9

Results and Discussion
The NPG sample, prepared as detailed in Section 1 of the Supporting Information, after mild annealing
in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) shows high purity and absence of residual
contaminants and/or doping, as detected by core-level photoemission
spectroscopy (Section 3 of Supporting Information). The free-standing nanoporous 3D graphene sample, depicted by helium
ion microscopy (HIM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images
reported in Figure 1a–c, presents large flat areas decorated by pores with diameters
in the range 0.5–1.0 μm, appearing like a pierced sheet
folded in layers with convex and concave curvatures, wrinkles, and
interconnected channels without frayed edges. It is worth noticing
that the very high surface sensitivity of HIM15 allows the probing of few graphene layers, thus revealing in detail
the 3D and complex nature of the sample morphology of the outermost
layer. The high crystalline quality of the sample is deduced by high-resolution
TEM images taken at different spatial scales, shown in Figure 1d,e, where the hexagonal graphene
crystal lattice is well visible over a large scale with a well-defined
diffraction pattern (f). The hexagonal moiré superstructure
(e) and the parallel straight bands (top-left corner of panel d) found
in some regions of the NPG sample suggest the presence of misoriented
bilayers.

Figure 1 NPG sample. (a,b) HIM images at different magnifications, taken
with helium beam energy E = 25 keV, (c) low-resolution
TEM image, (d,e) high-resolution TEM images, and (f) TEM diffraction
pattern and zoomed images of the first diffraction spots around (0,0).

The hexagonal moiré superstructures
singled out in the TEM
images have periodicities of about 1.4 and 2.4 nm and can be explained
by assuming misoriented non-Bernal-stacked AB bilayers with a relative
angular shift of about 10° and 6°,16 respectively, in agreement with the angular difference between the
local multi-spot diffraction pattern reported in Figure 1f (see Section 2 of Supporting Information). The straight band modulation
seen in a few zones of the sample (see the top-left zone of Figure 1d) can also be attributed
to the moiré modulation induced by parallelogram misfit bilayers,16 owing to the tilted projection as observed by
TEM,17 intrinsic to the warped geometry
of NPG.

The sample appears as constituted by a suspended, interconnected,
and continuous graphene layer with misoriented bilayers in some regions.
The presence of layers with various distances, stacking, orientations,
and degree of π-orbital hybridization can be confirmed by spectromicroscopy
analysis. A selected micro-Raman spectrum on the NPG sample taken
in 300 nm sized pixels is shown in Figure 2d. At first sight, the low intensity of the
“D” Raman peak and the high intensity of the “2D”
band suggest the presence of a high-quality graphene sample constituted
by a majority of interconnected single layers (SLs). In fact, the
“G” band (sp2 C–C stretching mode)
is at 1580.6 cm–1 over the whole sample, the “2D”
band (double-resonant second-order mode activated by in-plane breathing
of the hexagonal rings) is at 2693.0 cm–1, slightly
blue-shifted with respect to SL graphene, and the very small “D”
band (activated by the presence of lattice defects) is at 1356 cm–1, as determined by the fitting analysis (detailed
in Section 4.1 of the Supporting Information). The symmetric line shape of the “2D” band rules
out effects of π-orbital hybridization between adjacent AB Bernal-stacked
graphene sheets, which would induce splitting into four components
and a definite band asymmetry.13,18

Figure 2 NPG sample. Spatially
resolved micro-Raman maps of the 2D/G (a)
and D/G (b) Raman peak intensity ratios; 12 × 12 μm2 images formed by 300 × 300 nm2 pixels. Micro-Raman
spectrum taken onto a 500 nm-diameter spot (d) with the distribution
of the 2D/G integral intensity ratio taken onto a 10 × 10 μm2 area (c).

A quality proof of the
NPG sample can be obtained by mapping the I2D/IG and ID/IG intensity ratios,
whose imaging over a 12 × 12 μm2 area constituted
by 300 × 300 nm2 pixels is presented in Figure 2a,b. Large flat areas of hundreds
of nanometers are clearly identified for I2D/IG, in agreement with the HIM/TEM images
at the same scale. The histogram of the I2D/IG ratio estimated over the whole probed
area (Figure 2c) assesses
the high average quality of the sample, with a mean value of the distribution
of 2.6 and a width (σ = 0.6) reflecting the variety of morphological
configurations/orientations in this undoped and contaminant-free NPG
sample. This high value of the I2D/IG ratio is consistent with the presence of one-to-two
layers of planar graphene, though curvatures in NPG may influence
its absolute value.

Uniaxial and biaxial strain effects in the
hexagonal lattice in
graphene-based systems have been proposed to justify variations of
the Raman peak positions associated with the hexagonal lattice change.19,20 Tensile (compressive) strain can induce a phonon softening (stiffening),
leading to a red (blue) shift and broadening of the “2D”
and “G” bands. We observe a small stiffening of the
“2D” band, compatible with a slight compressive strain
on the order of 0.3%,21 likely to be attributed
to the drying process after NPG growth. Different orientations between
adjacent misoriented bilayers can induce Raman band broadening,18,22−25 in very good agreement with the high-resolution TEM images (Figure 1d,e). Thus, the symmetric
line shape of the “2D” band with a wider width (54 cm–1) than that expected at SL graphene can be associated
with the coexistence of continuous SL graphene with some regions of
disoriented non-Bernal-stacked bilayers,18,22−25 owing to NPG preparation on Ni below 1000 °C,22 that can generate turbostratically stacked bilayers.22,26−28

The non-homogeneous grainy ID/IG imaging, mirroring the
defect distribution
density, is inversely proportional to the I2D/IG image in terms of brighter versus
darker regions (Figure 2a,b).29 This mapping unveils a very low
defect intensity, with the presence of 5–7 lattice distortions
from pure hexagons only in the complementary regions where the I2D/IG intensity
ratio is lower, confirming the high-spatial-resolution TEM images.3 These defects, despite appearing with a very
low density, are intrinsically associated with the curvature necessary
to warp graphene into the 3D NPG structure, as previously reported
in refs (2)(3), and (9). The D/G intensity ratio
can also be directly related to the average crystallite size (i.e.,
average distance between two defects/edges), according to the Tuinstra–Koenig
relation:30La (nm) = 2.4 × 10–10 × λ4 × IG/ID. In this NPG sample, average La results
about 225 nm (λ being 532 nm), in agreement with the typical
size of the structures as observed in the aforementioned microscopy
data.

The Raman spectra demonstrate that the NPG 3D architecture
is indeed
very similar to that of ideal decoupled and suspended graphene layers,
with a low density of defects over all of the NPG specimen. These
results have been verified also for NPG samples with smaller nanopore
size, although the intensity of the “D” Raman peak is
slightly higher in this case because of a larger curvature gradient
in the pore regions (see Section 4.2 of Supporting Information).3,18 The topology as observed by HIM,
TEM, and Raman microspectroscopy allows us to define this 3D NPG architecture
as composed by highly interconnected graphene sheets, where only a
slight compressive strain and the presence of rotational misoriented
bilayer graphene are observed. These lines of evidence and the absence
of interface interactions, frayed borders, and edge defects could
provide a novel route to exploit this 3D NPG with the desirable electronic
properties of an ideal suspended 2D graphene. However, only a spatially
resolved analysis of the electronic states via the very surface-sensitive
nanoscanning photoelectron spectroscopy can verify whether NPG presents
the properties of 2D graphene and whether we can associate different
hybridization states and electronic spectral DOS with the different
spatial zones of the actual NPG samples, namely, at flat and at bent/wrinkled
regions.

The precise topological and structural description
obtained by
HIM and TEM together with Raman mapping does not give univocal hallmarks
of the electronic properties of 2D NPG.

The spatially integrated
C 1s and valence band spectra of the NPG
sample compared with those taken on HOPG are shown in Figure 3a,b. The C 1s centroid (Figure 3a) is located almost
at the same binding energy (BE; 284.4 eV) attained at HOPG (284.3
eV), with a broader lineshape likely to be attributed to the presence
of C 1s multicomponent at higher BE.31 The
angle-integrated photoelectron spectroscopy valence band data (Figure 3b) allow the identification
of both the σ-band, at about 7.7 eV BE, the π-band, centered
at about 3.1 eV BE, and a linear spectral density toward the Fermi
level, reflecting the typical lineshape measured on suspended graphene.32 It is worth noting that these data are very
surface sensitive, owing to the chosen photon energy (hν = 350 and 100 eV, for the C 1s and VB data, respectively) guaranteeing a photoelectron kinetic energy
at the minimum escape depth (only few Å).33 The photoemission data are therefore related to non-interacting
graphene layers at the surface of the NPG sample.

highly oriented pyrolitic graphite (HOPG) shown for comparison (gray

in the inset, zoomed region around the Fermi level.

Although the averaged spatial signal shows the
dominant 2D signatures
of suspended graphene, the spatial distribution of the hallmarks of
graphene is essential to disentangle the chemical, optical, transport,
and electronic properties of NPG structures. In the following, both chemical imaging and electronic
imaging, using high energetic and spatial resolution nanoscanning
photoemission, have been combined to determine directly the sp2/sp3 degree of hybridization throughout the sample
as well as its relation with the DOS at the Fermi level. Recently,
high energy and angular resolution nanoscanning photoemission measurements
of core levels and valence band at a given momentum, with a spatial
resolution of a few hundred nanometer scale, have been made possible,34−36 combining information on the chemical sensitivity and hybridization
state (core levels), with the spectral density close to the Fermi
level (valence band) at the same scale. In the last decade, disentangling
the actual carbon chemical state in sp2-based nanostructures
(such as C nanotubes)37,38 with a resolution down to few
hundred nanometers has been a great challenge. This innovative spectromicroscopy
approach applied to the NPG sample paves the way for imaging electronic
states at new frontiers because a combined analysis of both the C
1s and the spectral density close to EF for graphene structures at the nanoscale is still lacking.

The spatially resolved C 1s mapping of the NPG sample taken on
300 × 300 nm2 size pixels is shown in Figure 4. At this scale, we clearly
identify everywhere in the probed area two components in the C 1s
feature, fitted by two asymmetric pseudo-Voigt (Gaussian and Lorentzian)
curves, the dominant component centered at 284.4 (sp2-like)
and the smaller component centered at 285.1 eV, whose energy value
suggests its attribution to a distortion of the perfect sp2 bonds of graphene toward an sp3-like hybridization state.39−41 The relative intensity ratio of the two components varies in the
mapping, depending on the topology of the NPG zone.

Figure 4 Spatially resolved C
1s core-level mapping of the NPG sample on
12 × 12 μm2 area, constituted by 300 ×
300 nm2 pixels, taken with 350 eV photon energy, is reported
in panel (a), showing the typical tubular-shaped structures of the
sample. The C 1s spectrum spatially averaged over the mapping is plotted
in panel (d), whose two components are fitted with sp2-like
(284.4 eV) and sp3-like (285.1 eV) peaks, after subtraction
of a Shirley background (dashed lines). The sp2-like and
sp3-like mappings are obtained by energy integrating (0.6
eV energy windows) around either 284.4 or 285.1 eV BE, and they are
reported in panels (b) and (c), respectively. The C 1s core-level
spectra with the dominant sp2-like component (red star
in the total mapping a) and with a more intense sp3-like
component (blue star in the total mapping a) are reported in panels
(e) and (f), respectively. The tubular-shaped structures of the sample
are also reflected in the sp2-like mapping (e) representative
of the flatter areas, whereas the sp3-like mapping (f)
associated with the highly bent/wrinkled regions highlight their complementary
spatial distribution. Color scales of maps are normalized to the maximum
intensity of the corresponding peak.

To correlate the bond distortion with the morphology of the
NPG
sample, the intensity spatial mappings generated by selecting the
energy regions centered on the main component at 284.4 (sp2-like) and on the component at 285.1 (sp3-like) are reported
in Figure 4 (middle
and right panels, respectively). The images are obtained by integrating
the data in a 0.6 eV energy window around 284.4 and 285.1 eV. While
we observe the same general diagonal-shaped structures in both images
(dominated by the main sp2 component), the sp3-like component prevails in the border areas of the elongated tubular
regions.

Wrinkles and highly bent regions are indeed expected
to induce
some of the carbon atoms to partially warp the sp2 bonding
and rehybridize toward an sp3-like configuration, generating
a high BE weight in the spectra. We exclude everywhere in the sample
the presence of contaminants or oxidation, as revealed in the survey
photoemission spectrum shown in Section 3 of the Supporting Information. Furthermore, the absence of a low-BE
component associated with unsaturated in-plane C bonds42,43 points out the irrelevant density of edge defects, in agreement
with the low “D” band intensity in the Raman spectra.
The absence of frayed contours with armchair and/or zigzag edges confirms
the bicontinuous topology, as suggested by Ito et al.4 The nanospectroscopy images in Figure 4 demonstrate that the very 2D graphene properties
dominate in the NPG sample, with the prominent sp2 C 1s
peak and the presence of a small component owing to distorted bonds.
We notice that the same analysis carried out on an NPG sample with
smaller pore size and higher curvature gradients reveals a slight
intensity increase in the sp3-like component, as reported
in Section 4.3 of the Supporting Information, but the dominant planar hybridization state is preserved.

The most important spectroscopic signature of 2D graphene is the
linear DOS toward the Fermi level, reflecting the Dirac cone band.
A detailed spatial mapping can correlate the sample topology to the
DOS close to the Fermi level, which could have consequences on the
electrical/thermal conductivities of the NPG. Spatially resolved DOS
photoelectron spectroscopy data of the NPG sample taken in the first
few electronvolts below the Fermi level (EF) in a 12 × 12 μm2 spot, with a high spatial
resolution at the submicrometer scale (300 × 300 nm2), are shown in Figure 5a.

Figure 5 Spatially resolved valence band taken at 100 eV photon energy on
the NPG sample with 300 nm spatial resolution. Left panel (a) intensity
map of the valence band signal taken over 300 × 300 nm2 pixels in 12 × 12 μm2 sized zone. Center (b)
and right (c) panels: spectral DOS in the low-BE region taken at flat
area (b) and edge (c) zones marked by red and blue stars, respectively,
in the mapping; insets: zoomed energy regions close to EF, showing either a linearly decreasing (b) or an edge-like
DOS toward EF (c); data (dotted lines)
with superimposed linear fit (b) or linear + Gaussian fit multiplied
by the steplike Fermi–Dirac distribution function (c).

A point-to-point analysis of the
spatially resolved spectra reveals
the dominance of data with the following characteristics: (i) a spectral
density with a common linear shape toward EF, in agreement with the expected DOS for ideal graphene with a Dirac
cone dispersion,32 (ii) a peak at about
3.1 eV owing to the 2p-π states, and (iii) a bump associated
with σ–π states at higher BE. In few regions, corresponding
to the edges of the tubular-shaped forms of the mapping, we observe
a reduction in the 2p-π state, which is more intense in pure
sp2 hybridization, and it is expected to be reduced as
the distortion toward sp3-like bonds progresses, as in
hydrogenated graphene.44 In Figure 5b,c, we present two exemplary
VB spectra taken in flat and bent/wrinkled regions of that spectroscopy
mapping. By focusing on the binding energies right below EF, a linear fit perfectly matches the DOS in the flat
regions of the sample (inset of Figure 5b), whereas the same kind of fit does not match appropriately
the complementary regions (inset to Figure 5c). We suggest these regions to be related
to the wrinkled/highly bent areas of the NPG sample, where the presence
of the distortion leads to sp3-like hybridized states.
By adding a Gaussian contribution to the linear spectral density and
multiplying the curve by the edge-like Fermi–Dirac distribution
function calculated at 80 K, we observe a tiny finite DOS contribution
at a few tenths of electronvolts below the Fermi level.

In summary,
the DOS mapping corroborates the spatial resolved spectroscopic
results obtained from the sp2-like and sp3-like
bonds in Figure 5.
Certainly, the feature at ≈3.1 eV BE, with sp2-like
character, shows a dominant distribution with areas of the order of
several micrometer size. By mapping the total spectral density, the
sp2-like distribution persists, indicating that the DOS
of the NPG sample is dominated by the electronic 2D graphene-like
character. Interestingly, mapping regions where that feature is less
intense are able to show where the sp3-like bonds are present.
Furthermore, these results enlighten the powerful approach of nanoscale
photoemission, able to precisely unravel and discriminate the coexistence
of even small sp3-like deformations in NPG materials strongly
dominated by the 2D hallmark of graphene-like structures. In fact,
the continuous topology, the absence of defects and sharp edges, and
the linear spectral density can ensure a 2D graphene-like electrical
conductivity (104 S/m)3 and
mobility (5000 cm2/V/s)9 of
these NPG sample.

Conclusions
These Raman and photoemission
nanospectromicroscopy studies unveil
that the NPG 3D structure is indeed very similar to that of ideal
decoupled graphene layers. Thanks to the state-of-the-art nano-photoemission
spectroscopy, we are able to correlate local electronic structures
with the different spatial regions in a single component sample. The
bicontinuous topology, imaged by scaling the spatial resolution down
to the 300 nm scale, reveals highly interconnected graphene sheets,
with only a slight compressive strain and presence of rotational misoriented
bilayers. The very low defect density and the absence of frayed borders
and edges optimize the 2D properties of this topologically bicontinuous
and connected 3D structure. The presence of wrinkled and bent regions,
where the distorted sp3-like bonds increase and the Dirac
cone is perturbed with a tiny gap opening, does not invalidate the
potentialities of these 3D NPG samples. The interconnected graphene
sheets retain the structural, vibrational, electronic, and transport
responses of the ideal 2D graphene, with a positive cost-benefit ratio
to overcome the limitation of integrating graphene in 3D devices.

Materials
and Methods
The NPG sample was synthesized by following the
procedure described
in detail in the Supporting Information: Ni30Mn70 ingots were used to generate nanoporous
Ni and then loaded in a quartz tube for producing graphene by CVD
into the template. The as-grown NPG, which inherited the spongy structure
of the substrate, was then exfoliated by chemically removing the Ni
substrate.

HIM images were collected with the Zeiss Orion Nanofab
helium ion
microscope (Peabody, USA) located in the CARF Laboratories of the
Queensland University of Technology (Brisbane, Australia), with a
beam acceleration of 25 kV and a working distance of 14 mm. The secondary
electron signal was collected with an Everhart–Thornley detector
with 500 V collector bias.

Micro-Raman spectra were acquired
in the same facility by using
a WITec alpha300R microscope (WITec GmbH, Ulm, Germany) equipped with
a diode-pumped Nd:YAG laser, operating at 532 nm, focused through
a 50× Zeiss objective (0.7NA) to obtain a spot size of about
250 nm. The Raman maps were collected in pixels of 300 × 300
nm2, and the laser power was kept at 1.0 mW to avoid beam
damage.

TEM images and diffraction patterns were taken with
a JEOL JEM-2100F
system equipped with two aberration correctors for the image- and
probe-forming lens systems. High-resolution TEM observations were
conducted at an accelerating voltage of 120.0 and 200.0 kV, both Cs
correctors were optimized for image observations, and the point-to-point
resolutions of TEM were 1.3 Å. Further details are provided in
the Supporting Information.

The spectromicroscopy
photoemission experiments were carried out
at the ANTARES beamline (SOLEIL synchrotron radiation facility). The
nano-X-ray photoelectrom spectroscopy (XPS) microscope is equipped
with two Fresnel zone plates for beam focusing, whereas higher diffraction
orders were eliminated, thanks to an order selection aperture. The
sample was placed on a precision positioning stage located at the
common focus point of the hemispherical Scienta R4000 analyzer (whose
energy resolution is 0.005 eV) and the Fresnel zone plates, and this
experimental setup was used both for the collection of point-mode
spectra and imaging-mode spectra. In this mode, the photo-emitted
electron intensity from the desired energy range is collected over
the sample to form a 2D image resolved at the submicrometer range
(pixel size of 300 × 300 nm2). Core-level and valence
band spectra were taken with 350 and 100 eV photon energy, respectively.
The analyzer pass energy was set to 100 eV (200 eV) for the spatially
unresolved (resolved) mode.

After insertion in UHV, the NPG
sample was degassed at 500 °C
for 2 h to minimize contamination from the environment. The base pressure
of the UHV chamber was kept in the range 10–10 mbar,
whereas the sample was cooled via liquid nitrogen (≃89 K) to
avoid damaging the sample via radiation pressure.
