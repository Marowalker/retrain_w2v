Circular dichroism spectroscopy is a technique used to
discriminate
molecular chirality, which is essential in fields like biology, chemistry,
or pharmacology where different chiral agents often show different
biological activities. Nevertheless, due to the inherently weak molecular-chiroptical
activity, this technique is limited to high concentrations or large
analyte volumes. Finding novel ways to enhance the circular dichroism
would boost the performance of these techniques. So far, the enhancement
of light–matter interaction mediated by plasmons is the most
common way to develop chiral plasmonic structures with extraordinarily
strong chiroptical responses. However, absorptive losses of metals
at optical frequencies has hindered its practical use in many scenarios.
In this work, we propose an all-dielectric low-loss chiral metasurface
with unit cells built by high-refractive-index crossed-bowtie nanoantennas.
These unit cells, built of silicon, strongly increase the chiroptical
effect through the simultaneous interaction of their electric and
magnetic modes, which in contrast to other recent proposals shows
at the same time a high concentration of the electric field in its
gap that leads to the presence of hotspots. The proposed structure
exhibits a circular dichroism spectra up to 3-fold higher than that
of previous proposals that use complex plasmonic or hybrid nanostructures,
making it a clear alternative to develop low-loss metasurfaces with
potential applications in chiral target sensing/biosensing. For completeness,
single triangular shaped and symmetric (achiral) bowtie nanostructures
were also studied as possible candidates for a detection up to the
single-molecule level due the lack of a circular dichroism background
of the nanostructures themselves.

Introduction
Chirality refers to a geometrical or structural
handedness of an
object, meaning that its mirror image cannot be superimposed on itself.
This phenomenon is ubiquitous in nature and plays a key role in life
sciences, analytical chemistry, biochemistry, and medical sciences.1,2 An example of chiral structures in chemistry are the enantiomers,
also known as optical isomers. In pharmacology, for example, different
enantiomers have the same chemical structure, but their biological
activities can make a significant difference between an effective
treatment or an ineffective one (with serious side-effects).3,4 From the optical point of view, chiral materials present different
refractive indexes when interacting with left circularly polarized
(LCP) light or right circularly polarized (RCP) light, giving rise
to optical activity (OA) and circular dichroism (CD).5,6 The first phenomenon consists of the rotation induced in the polarization
plane of linearly polarized light (which is just a superposition of
LCP and RCP lights) and the second is the difference in absorption
when excited by left and right circularly polarized lights. Both phenomena
are extremely connected by the Kramers–Kronig relations.

CD spectroscopy, that is, the differential absorption of left-
and right-hand circularly polarized (LCP and RCP) light, is traditionally
used to discriminate molecular chirality.7 Nevertheless, due to the inherently weak molecular-chiroptical activity,
this technique is limited to high concentrations or large analyte
volumes. On the other hand, recent advances in metamaterials,8,9 optoelectronics,10−12 biosensing,13−15 enantioselective forces,16−18 nanometrology,19 and ultrafast data processing20,21 stem from the combined advances in the tailoring, patterning, and
manipulation of light through confinement and enhancement at nanometric
scales. The ability of plasmonic structures to localize and enhance
light at dimensions much smaller than the incident wavelength,22 through the resonant coupling of electromagnetic
waves to collective oscillations of free electrons in metals, has
been extensively used for these purposes. In particular, the last
few years have witnessed an explosive development of chiral plasmonic
structures with extraordinarily strong chiroptical responses.23−35 However, absorptive losses associated with the inter- and intraband
transitions in metals at optical frequencies constitute a major hurdle
for practical use in many scenarios.

The use of high-refractive-index
(HRI) dielectric nanostructures,
where Ohmic losses inherent to metals can be significantly diminished,
has emerged as a promising solution to control the near- and far-field
optical response at the nanoscale.36,37 In contrast
to their plasmonic counterpart, where the electromagnetic enhancement
is governed only by electric resonances, HRI dielectric nanoparticles
can exhibit both electric and magnetic resonances.38−40 Important applications
are envisaged, like optical cloaking,41 harmonic generation,42,43 nanoscale lasers,44 or directionality of light.45−48 Despite these advances, their
use in some applications are limited by the relatively mild intensity
of the electric-field enhancement and the occurrence of the magnetic
hotspot inside the nanoparticles, thus being hard to access. To surpass
these limitations, some recent works49,50 demonstrated
that in analogy to plasmonic aggregates, ensembles of two or more
dielectric particles exhibit large enhancements of the electric and
magnetic fields in the gap (hotspots). Inspired by these works, here
we propose an all-dielectric low-loss chiral metasurface with unit
cells built by high-refractive-index crossed-bowtie nanoantennas.
These unit cells, built of silicon, strongly increase the chiroptical
effect through the simultaneous interaction of their electric and
magnetic modes. Recent proposals51 use
dielectric nanospheres of different sizes to produce CD signals, where
the excitation of strong hotspots can be hindered by the curvilinear
surface of the spheres. Our platform shows a high concentration of
the electric field in its gap that leads to the presence of hotspots
being directly accessible to nearby emitters, thus opening the route
for new low-loss surface-enhanced spectroscopies, sensing, and other
applications in the field of nanophotonics. An additional advantage
of the crossed-bowtie unit cell is that it can be excited at normal
incidence, whereas in the case of spherical oligomers of different
unit sizes, the electric field needs to be obliquely placed along
the line joining two diameters to generate a hotspot. As a result,
the proposed structure exhibits a circular dichroism spectra up to
3-fold higher than those of previous proposals that use complex plasmonic
or hybrid nanostructures,52 making it a
clear alternative to develop low-loss metasurfaces with potential
applications in chiral target sensing/biosensing. We also highlight
that this chiral structure can be spectrally tuned to exhibit its
maximum circular dichroism at the desired wavelength by just engineering
its size, shape, and periodicity.

Results and Discussion
It is known that high-refractive-index
dielectric nanoparticles,
when excited with light, can retain the electromagnetic field inside
due to the generation of strong displacement currents. This effect,
for resonant frequencies, can lead to electric and/or magnetic resonant
modes produced by the inner field distributions. Analogous to metallic
nanoparticles, under surface plasmon resonance conditions, HRI dielectric
particles can also exhibit enhanced electric field distributions at
their boundaries. When resonant nanoparticles, metallic or dielectric,
are coupled, forming dimers, trimers, or more complex aggregates,
their electric modes in the case of plasmonics, and electric and magnetic
modes in the case of dielectrics, overlap and lead to an enhancement
and spectral shift of the extinction cross sections. Figures 1a–c show the extinction
spectra of a single triangular scatterer, a bowtie, and two crossed
bowtie scatterers, respectively. All of them made of amorphous silicon53 and surrounded by air. They are illuminated
by left and right circularly polarized plane waves with the wavevector
perpendicular to them and along the z-axis. These
systems were considered as deposited on a glass (ng = 1.5) substrate and surrounded by air. The corresponding
extinction spectra, σext = σscat + σabs, were numerically calculated with the finite-difference
time-domain (FDTD) method. σscat and σabs correspond to the scattering and absorption cross sections
associated with each platform. The length of the side and the height
of each triangle is constant here, l = 190 nm and h = 100 nm, to keep their resonances in the optical range
and a tip-to-tip length of 20 nm. The optical constants for silicon
were obtained from Palik.53

Figure 1 Extinction spectra, σext, for (a) a single triangular
scatterer, (b) a dielectric bowtie nanoantenna, and (c) two crossed-bowtie
nanoantennas. Triangular scatterers are considered as made of Si,
with sides l = 190 nm and height h = 100 nm. The tip-to-tip gap was taken as g = 20
nm. Results for right/left circularly polarized (RCP/LCP) light, incident
along the z-axis, are presented by solid/dashed (red/blue)
lines. The corresponding electric and magnetic near-field intensities,
at the highest resonance wavelengths, are presented in (d)–(f)
and (g)–(i), respectively.

Three overlapping peaks with a small difference
in width, amplitude,
and spectral position can be clearly identified in all cases for incident
wavelengths of λ ≈ 570, 520, and 430 nm, corresponding
to magnetic dipolar, electric dipolar, and magnetic quadrupolar resonances,
respectively.49 We observe that both the
magnetic and the electric resonances are slightly shifted (the magnetic
resonance to the blue and the electric resonance to the red), and
their intensities vary consequently. In the same way that metallic
nanoparticles can concentrate electric fields in small volumes, when
dielectric nanoparticles are coupled to form dielectric antennas,
they also provide a reasonably strong electric field enhancement and
localization of electromagnetic energy in the antenna gap. Calculations
demonstrate that intense and localized electric and magnetic near-fields
are present in the gap of dielectric bowties and crossed-bowties. Figures 1d–f,g–i
show that the normalized electric and magnetic near-fields for LCP
incident light at the magnetic resonance wavelength exhibit a rotational
symmetry on the xy plane in all cases, leading to
a lack of optical chirality, that is, σRCP = σLCP. This can also be understood in terms of the mirror symmetry
along the z-axis that all of the systems present.
However, we must remark here that all of these nonchiral structures
have an associated near-field optical chirality, C, at each resonance, as can be observed in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information. The optical chirality, , quantifies the interaction strength of
the electromagnetic field with the chiral photonic structure, thus
being responsible for the CD spectroscopic signal. This term reaches
its maximum value, , for circularly polarized light (CPL) in
free-space.54 Hence, the enhancement of
the electric and magnetic field amplitudes, for which Im(E*·B) ≠ 0, is a key element to improve the
CD signal.54

The first approach to
introduce chiral optical activity in the
system consists of breaking the mirror symmetry of the structure along
the z-axis. This can be done in three different ways:
changing the side lengths of each arm, the heights, and both together,
as depicted in Figures 2a–c, respectively. The corresponding CD signal for each case,
in the extinction spectra, is calculated as follows29 1  with σ being the extinction cross section
for RCP and LCP illumination, which was calculated via the commercial
software Lumerical FDTD, for wavelengths in the range from λ
= 300 to 900 nm, and considering all of the media as isotropic.

Figure 2 Crossed-bowtie
nanoantennas with a broken mirror symmetry along
the z-axis by changing the (a) side lengths, (b)
heights, and (c) simultaneously the heights and side lengths of the
building dielectric scatterers. (d–f) Extinction spectra, σext, of the systems shown in (a)–(c), respectively,
for RCP/LCP incident light are presented by solid/dashed (red/blue)
lines. Results were calculated for systems with symmetry breaking
by changing the (a) side lengths, (b) heights, and (c) side lengths
and heights, simultaneously, for the building dielectric scatterers.
(g–i) CD spectra calculated for the systems (a)–(c),
respectively.

In the first case, shown in Figure 2a, side-lengths of the dielectric triangles
were increased
from 170 to 230 nm, in steps of 20 nm, following the anticlockwise
direction. A small differences in the extinction spectra of the system
is observed (Figure 2d), thus producing a negligible effect in the CD spectral response,
as can be seen in Figure 2g. A second symmetry-breaking procedure consisted of varying
the scatterer heights from 80 to 140 nm, in steps of 20 nm, following
the anticlockwise sense, as depicted in Figure 2b. Although differences in the extinction
spectra remain small (see Figure 2e), the CD amplitude was slightly increased when compared
with the previous case, as noted from Figures 2g and 2h. In the last
case, we simultaneously changed the side lengths and heights, in steps
of 20 nm, again following the anticlockwise direction. The latter
case is depicted in Figure 2c. The corresponding extinction spectra, for RCP and LCP incident
lights, are plotted in Figure 2f. In this case, we find the largest CD signal, as noted from Figure 2i, showing this configuration
as a clear candidate to be used later as the periodic unit cell for
the design of a two-dimensional chiral all-dielectric metasurface.
We must remark that the studied chiral platforms present enhanced
and robust CD signals, in contrast to previous plasmonic proposals52 requiring precise control of the cooling and
the seed structure to exhibit an about three times smaller chiroptical
activity.

As mentioned before, enhanced CD signals require the
enhancement
of the electric and magnetic near-fields to produce higher Im(E*·B) terms. A deep insight can be obtained
from the electric and magnetic field maps in Figure 3. The near-field maps are only shown for
the wavelengths corresponding to the maximum amplitudes of the CD
signal extracted from Figures 2h,i. Thus, Figures 3a,b [e,f] and Figures 3c,d [g,h] are for RCP [LCP] polarization at λ = 597.12 and 511.29 nm, respectively.
In the case of Figures 3a,b and Figures 3e,f,
we can observe that there is only a small difference for the interaction
of RCP and LCP incident lights with the structure, where the electric
hotspots are mainly located at the external boundaries of the scatterers
and the magnetic fields only exhibit a small difference in their amplitudes.
On the other hand, Figures 3c,d and Figures 3g,h exhibit strong changes in their amplitudes and symmetries, with
the additional advantage of having the hotspots located at the gap
region. The latter hotspots can be exploited to improve light–molecule
interactions in chiral-sensing applications, for example, by placing
a chiral molecule at the gap region. The optical chiralities for these
structures, associated with each resonance, are shown in Figure S2 of the Supporting Information.

Figure 3 Near-field
profiles for RCP and LCP incident lights, (a–d)
corresponding to the wavelength (λ = 597.122 nm) of the maximum
amplitude in Figure 2h and (e)–(h) to the wavelength (λ = 511.294 nm) of
the maximum amplitude in Figure 2i, are presented in the upper and lower panels, respectively.

To show the robustness of our proposal, the effects
induced by
small shifts and asymmetries, in the tip-to-tip gaps of the system
described in Figure 2c, were also studied. In Figures 4a,b, we considered two different possibilities, as
illustrated in the corresponding insets. In the first case, we considered
a small misalignment of 10 nm around the center of both crossed bowties
(see Figure 4a). In
the second, we explored two different tip-to-tip gap distances, 20
and 30 nm, for the longitudinal and transversal bowties, respectively,
as depicted in Figure 4b. The extinction spectra, for RCP and LCP polarizations, do not
suffer any considerable change when compared with the ones in Figure 2c, thus indicating
a robust behavior. The same can be concluded for the corresponding
CD spectra in Figures 4d,e when compared with results in Figure 2i. Another feature we explored was to double
the gap sizes in Figure 2f (20 nm), that is, using gaps of 40 nm. The latter results are presented
in Figures 4c,f, from
where a small decrease in the CD amplitude can be seen. This result
is consistent with the literature since longer distances between scatterers
lead to smaller mode interactions.49

Figure 4 RCP (solid)
and LCP (dashed) scattering spectra for the system
in Figure 2f under
misalignment and asymmetries. A misalignment of 10 nm around the center
was considered in (a) (see inset). In (b), different tip-to-tip gap
sizes, 20 and 30 nm, were used (see inset). Symmetric gaps of 40 nm
were considered in (c) (see inset). The corresponding CD spectra are
presented in (d)–(f).

In Figure 5, we
compare the results for the structure in Figure 2c with the ones for the same system but made
of gold. The preferential absorption of CPL by a chiral molecule is
described by the dissymmetry factor, g, defined as
follows60 2  with Ue = (ε0/4)|Ẽ|2 being the time-average
electric energy density. G″ and α″
are the molecule’s chirality and electric polarizability, that
is, the chiral asymmetry (g) in the absorption of
light by a molecule is proportional to both the chirality of matter
and the chirality of the electromagnetic field. This equation can
be rewritten as follows60 3  from where it can be noted that g can be enhanced above gCPL by increasing
the local density of chirality C or decreasing the
local field intensity. In Figures 5a–d, we present the scattering-to-absorption
cross-sectional ratios, the CD spectrum, and the dissymmetry factor ĝ for LCP and RCP polarizations, respectively. The
same results are presented in the case of the structure made of gold
in Figure 5e–h.
We clearly observe large scattering-to-absorption ratios for the dielectric
system, indicating a reduction in the losses’ contribution
when compared with their plasmonic counterparts. Moreover, a larger
CD signal is also noted for the dielectric system. In Figures 5c,d and Figures 5g,h, we present the results for the dissymmetry
factor, for both systems, for each polarization of the incident light.
Results indicate that these systems exhibit a high chiroptical activity,
large CD, and C fields with chiral hotspots. However,
the main disadvantage of using chiral platforms, dielectric or plasmonic,
is associated with the strong chiroptical background from the structure,
as noted from the latter results. In this respect, symmetric structures
from Figure 1, where C values are enhanced for each polarization, can be competitive
with some recent proposals59−61 to improve CD measurements from
dielectric nanoparticle systems.

Figure 5 Ratio of the scattering to absorption,
CD spectrum, and dissymmetry
factors for LCP and RCP incident lights are presented for the systems
made of (a–d) Si and (e–h) Au, respectively.

The final objective of this work is to propose
an all-dielectric
chiral metasurface, as illustrated in the insets of Figure 6a,b, for potential applications
in highly efficient chiral biosensors. For this purpose and based
on its high chiral optical activity, we considered the crossed-bowtie
structure shown in Figure 2c as the unit cell to build the metasurface. It was arranged
in a squared lattice with a size period length Δ concentric
with the central gap. The corresponding CD signal was calculated from
the transmittance spectra as follows 4  with TRCP and TLCP being the transmittances for RCP and LCP
incident lights, respectively. The transmittance and CD spectra are
shown in Figures 6a,b
and Figures 6c,d, respectively,
for Λ = 800 and 600 nm. The increase in chiral optical activity,
while decreasing the length of the period, is explained by the increase
in the overlap of the electric near-field tails between the neighboring
cells. This can be noted from Figure 7, where we present the corresponding chiral near-fields,
normalized by the CCPL of the free-space-propagating
CPL light, within a unit cell for periods Λ = 800 nm in Figure 7a,b and Λ
= 600 nm in Figure 7c,d. Results are presented for RCP and LCP incident lights. It has
been previously observed and explained55,56 that in the
case of plasmonic nanoparticles, the near-field overlap among neighboring
scatterers resemble the electronic bands comprising well-localized
atomic orbitals. Thus, we show here how to design the corresponding
chiral “meta-atoms”, made as a crossed-bowtie systems,
to build all-dielectric chiral metasurfaces with enhanced chiroptical
responses. We also emphasize that the low-loss structure, observed
from the scattering/absorption ratio for the unit cells, proposed
in this work exhibits a CD spectral response higher than those in
recent proposals that use complex plasmonic or hybrid nanostructures.52,57

Conclusions
We have demonstrated that all-dielectric
metasurfaces, consisting
of a two-dimensional periodic arrangement of conveniently designed
Si crossed-bowtie nanoantennas, can generate chiral hotspots and robust
CD signals. Based on the separation distance of the crossed-bowtie
systems, we can control the overlap between the corresponding electric
and magnetic modes responsible for maximizing the optical chirality
of the proposed metasurfaces. The corresponding electric hotspots
are located at the central gap region, which opens up the possibility
of using this metasurface for circular dichroism spectroscopy. Finally,
it is worth mentioning that the proposed metasurface can be relevant
in chiral biosensing applications, such as optical enantiomer discrimination
after proper functionalization of the metasurface.58 However, for a detection up to the single-molecule level,
an array of symmetric systems can be better suited to avoid the strong
background of CD from chiral bowties.
