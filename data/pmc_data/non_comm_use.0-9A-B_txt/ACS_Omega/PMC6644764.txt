In this work, we uncover a mechanism
initiating spontaneous nucleation
of graphene flakes on copper foil during the annealing phase of chemical
vapor deposition (CVD) process. We demonstrate that the carbon in
the bulk of copper foil is the source of nucleation. Although carbon
solubility in a pure copper bulk is very low, excess carbon can be
embedded inside the copper foil during the foil production process.
Using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, we measured
the distribution profile of carbon atoms inside the copper foils and
its variation by thermal annealing. We also studied the role of hydrogen
in the segregation of carbon from the bulk to the surface of copper
during annealing by scanning electron microscopy and Raman analysis.
We found that carbon atoms diffuse out from the copper foil and accumulate
on its surface during annealing in the presence of hydrogen. Consequently,
graphene crystals can be nucleated and grown while “any external”
carbon precursor was entirely avoided. To our knowledge, this is the
first time that such growth has been demonstrated to take place. We
believe that this finding brings a new insight into the initial nucleation
of graphene in the CVD process and helps to achieve reproducible growth
recipes.

1 Introduction
Since
the first demonstration of the growth of graphene by chemical
vapor deposition (CVD) on copper,1 a variety
of improvements such as achieving centimeter size single crystals2−5 and high carrier mobility comparable to mechanically exfoliated
graphene have been realized.6 These developments
have made CVD growth on copper the most prominent method for graphene
production for various suggested applications.7−9 Therefore, the
high demand for an economical and reproducible technique for the mass
scale production of high quality graphene has led to many studies
on CVD growth mechanisms.2,10−23 Li et al. demonstrated that due to the very low solubility of carbon
in copper, surface-adsorption governs graphene growth and makes it
a self-limited process.10 The growth terminates
as soon as the copper surface is fully covered with graphene, since
the active surface area on which to catalyze methane decomposition
and supply the carbon source is lost. It has thus been suggested that
besides the very low solubility of carbon in copper bulk, the high
mobility of carbon ad-atoms on copper due to the weak surface diffusion
barrier can boost the pure surface-based process mechanism.14,24,25

CVD growth of graphene
is generally explained to begin with the
adsorption of a hydrocarbon molecule on a catalyst surface followed
by its dissociation into active carbon radicals that diffuse on the
surface until they agglomerate on defects. This local concentration
continues to increase until the supersaturation level is reached and
crystal nucleation has started on defect points.23

The dramatic suppression of graphene nucleation attained
by introducing
oxygen to the CVD process has been a critical development towards
the growth of high quality graphene.2,26 However, it
has taken a while to understand the suppression of nucleation and
its relation to the reduction of carbon content in copper foil.19,27,28 Also, recent growth of graphene
“with ‘no’ feedstock” but from pump oil
highlighted the role of external carbon contamination.29

In this study, we reveal the role of intrinsic
carbon diffusing
out from the copper foil upon nucleation and growth of graphene crystals
when other sources of carbon contamination were meticulously avoided.
As a result, for the first time, to our knowledge, we demonstrate
the growth of micron-sized graphene flakes (GFs) on copper foil up
to the near full surface coverage in the absence of any external carbon
source. To measure the carbon content in the Cu foils, we used a time-of-flight
secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) technique, which has a
high mass resolution power (≈105) at a ppm level
of elemental detection. We show that before the beginning of the graphene
growth phase, hydrogen induces migration of carbon atoms from inside
copper foil towards its surface (H-assisted C depletion).

The
intensity profile of the carbon content versus depth in Cu
foils measured with ToF-SIMS provided not only direct evidence for
the presence of intrinsic carbon within the bulk of copper foil, but
also confirms the depletion of carbon from the bulk towards the surface
of Cu foil assisted by H during annealing.

As it is discussed
in detail in Section 3, we observed two possible consequences of
hydrogen-induced carbon depletion depending on the hydrogen partial
pressure: (i) growth of the disordered graphitic layer on copper;
(ii) nucleation and growth of graphene flakes from carbon impurity
trapped in the copper bulk. Our experiments indicate that the use
of low hydrogen concentration in a CVD process makes the second consequence
to be the most likely outcome. This leads to an uncontrolled spontaneous
nucleation and growth of graphene flakes (GFs) during the annealing
phase, before any carbon precursor is fed into the system. This premature
growth leads to an increased density of nucleation sites and, hence,
reduces the average crystal size and quality of graphene films.

The systematic work presented in this paper on the H-assisted C
depletion mechanism unveils an important detail about the origin of
the nucleation of graphene crystals and elucidates the relationship
between the nucleation density and process parameters.

2 Experimental Section
We used a CVD system with a 11 cm inner
diameter quartz tube during
the experiments. 25 μm-thick ultra-smooth Cu foils (<0.2 μm
roughness, 99.8% metallic pure LiB grade, P.N. B1-SBS) purchased from
Taiwan copper Foil Co. LTD. were used for main experiments. In addition,
99.999% metallic pure copper foil (25 μm thick purchased form
Alfa Aesar, P.N. 10950) representing different levels of purity was
used for comparison. Both types of Cu foils are not oxygen free. For
each test, we used a 2 × 3 cm2 sized Cu foil. To provide
a uniform gas flow over the foil, it was placed on a 10 cm diameter
quartz tube centered inside the main tube. The ambient gas is removed
from the CVD system by three times pumping down to 10–1 mbar followed by flushing with argon to 300 mbar. After this, when
the system reached a base pressure of 5 × 10–2 mbar the process was initiated by heating the system from room temperature
to 1000 °C in 40 min, followed by an annealing phase at 1000
°C. Only hydrogen (99.999% pure) and argon (99.999% pure) were
injected into the system during the heating up and annealing phases
to treat the copper surface. The pressure of the chamber was tuned
by a needle valve located between the tube exhaust and the pump. The
chamber is pumped by an Agilent TriScroll 300 dry pump (never been
connected to any other pumps) to exclude external carbon contamination
due to pump oil. Finally, the CVD system was cooled to room temperature
while maintaining the gas flow rates. The cooling of the chamber from
1000 to 200 °C took 10 min. A set of fresh quartz tubes (inner
tube 10 cm and outer tube 11 cm diameter, 99.998% pure, Yukang Quartz
Ltd) are used for the experiments in this work to exclude cross contamination.
Moreover, the tubes were baked at 1000 °C for 2 h under a 500
sccm flow of argon before the experiments.

We used scanning
electron microscopy (SEM, Zeiss Gemini 1530) to
structurally characterize the copper samples and graphene. A wet transfer
process is used to transfer graphitic films and graphene flakes from
the copper on to SiO2/Si substrates for Raman characterization.
First, a thin layer of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) (MicroChem
950 PMMA 2% in chlorobenzene) was spin-coated on the samples and baked
at 180 °C for 5 min. Then, the unintentionally grown graphene
at the back-side of the foil was removed by oxygen plasma. Next, the
samples were placed in 0.1 M aqueous (NH4)2S2O8, overnight. After the copper foil was etched
away, the graphene film with PMMA support was transferred from the
solution into deionized (DI) water. Three cycles of 10-min DI water
rinsing were applied to wash away the remaining etchant. Then the
film was picked up from water on a SiO2/Si substrate. Finally,
the PMMA was dissolved using a hot acetone bath at 70 °C, rinsed
with 2-propanol and dried with blowing compressed nitrogen. We used
Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw inVia Reflex) to confirm the presence
of carbon-based layers on the copper samples or after transfer.

Time-of-flight secondary
ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) is used
to take the depth profile of the carbon content in the Cu foils, using
TOF SIMS 5 (ION-TOF GmbH). To avoid edge effects on the generated
spectra, SIMS measurement is performed by analyzing a 150 × 150
μm2 area at the center of a 400 × 400 μm2 sputtered region. 2 keV Cs+ ions with 70 nA current
is used during the sputtering cycle and spectra are obtained by using
a 25 keV Bi3+ ion beam after each sputtering cycle. The
ion current of Bi+ was 1.5 pA in the interlaced mode with
a cycle time of 100 μs. We omitted the detected ions from the
top 1.9 nm of the samples to exclude the contribution of adsorbed
carbon from ambient air. This depth was determined from the local
minimum of the CH−  ions signal during depth
profiling.

3 Results and Discussion
Although we
meticulously avoided any carbon contamination in our
CVD setup, annealing of copper foil under relatively high concentrations
of hydrogen ambient led to the formation of graphitic films on its
surface. A series of annealing tests and ToF-SIMS depth-profile measurement
of carbon in the Cu foils confirmed the presence of intrinsic carbon
and its depletion to the surface during hydrogen annealing (H-assisted
C depletion). On the other hand, under lower hydrogen pressure, graphene
flakes were nucleated and grown without any external carbon precursor.
In fact, we realized that due to the depletion of carbon from the
bulk to the surface of the copper foil, the formation of nucleation
sites on the surface is initiated during the annealing phase before
any external carbon precursor is introduced. The details of our results
are described in the following subsections.

3.1 Presence
of Intrinsic Carbon and Its Depletion
In the first set of
experiments, three samples of copper foil were
used to investigate the effect of hydrogen partial pressure on the
depletion of intrinsic carbon during annealing.

The first two
samples were annealed for 20 min under the hydrogen partial pressure
values of 0 and 6 mbar and labeled accordingly as P-0 and P-6, respectively.
To avoid restructuring the surface of P-0 and forming cuprous oxide
(Cu2O) due to oxygen impurities as the temperature descends,
P-0 was cooled down under 6 mbar hydrogen.

The details of the
annealing conditions are given in Table 1, and Figures 1, S1 and S2 display
the SEM images of the corresponding samples after annealing. The annealing
of P-0 caused some changes in the morphology of the copper surface
such as the enlargement of the copper grains and reduction of the
native oxide layer (Figure S4), as expected.30 However, there is another noticeable change
in P-6 which is annealed under a hydrogen atmosphere; the emergence
of a dark thin film fully covering the surface of P-6 as well as black
spots scattered over it as seen in Figures 1b and S2. The
surface coverage on P-0 and P-6 were also tested by ambient oxidation31 as explained in detail in the Supporting Information
(Figure S5).

Figure 1 (a) SEM image of the
sample P-0 surface after 20 min annealing
under argon flow with no hydrogen. No specific feature can be seen
on the P-0 surface except for a few white spots identified as silicon
oxide particles. (b) The SEM image of the sample P-6 surface after
20 min annealing under 6 mbar hydrogen pressure. The copper surface
is fully covered by a graphitic thin film and darker spots signify
denser graphitic features. (c) The SEM image of the sample P-0-6 surface
which was first annealed just as P-0 and then as P-6 in the same cycle;
its surface shows no carbon features on it. During the first 20 min
of annealing without hydrogen, carbon impurities were scavenged by
oxygen impurities, thus, during the second 20 min annealing phase
under hydrogen no graphitic thin film could be grown due to the absence
of carbon supply. Large area SEM images of P-0, P-6, and P-0-6 can
be seen in Figures S1–S3, respectively.
(d) The Raman spectra of P-0, P-6 before and after its transfer on
a SiO2/Si substrate, and P-0-6. D and G peaks, around 1350
and 1600 cm–1 verify the presence of the disordered
graphitic structure on P-6, however, no graphitic peak can be seen
in the Raman spectra of P-0 and P-0-6.

a Without using any external carbon
precursor, a disordered graphitic (DG) film is formed on the surface
of P-6 due to the diminishing oxygen scavenging mechanism using H2 flow from the beginning of annealing.

These results hinted at a carbon-based
film formation on P-6 similar
to a graphene film grown on Cu foil, but no film on the P-0 surface.
Raman spectra of P-0 and P-6 samples before and after transfer confirmed
these observations; D and G peaks of the Raman spectra of P-6 illustrated
in Figure 1d manifest
a disordered graphitic structure.32 On
the contrary, Raman spectra of P-0 has no feature. No carbon precursor
was used during annealing and any external carbon contamination was
rigorously prevented. To exclude any possibility of carbon deposition
originating from the impurities in hydrogen gas, we performed a control
experiment on a third sample (P-0-6), comprising a two-step annealing
process as follows: during the first 20 min of annealing, no hydrogen
was used as in the case of P-0, then the annealing was continued for
another 20 min under 6 mbar hydrogen partial pressure as P-6. The
bare surface of P-0-6 at the end of the process as can be seen in Figures 1c, S3 and S5f verifies that the growth is not from carbon contamination,
neither in hydrogen gas nor from other external sources. We conclude
that the carbon atoms emerged on the P-6 surface originated from the
copper foil itself. In the following paragraphs, we explain the microscopic
mechanisms leading to the depletion of carbon in P-0 and P-0-6 and
carbon film formation on the P-6 surface.

Here, we also need
to note that the bare surface of P-0-6 compared
to P-6 confirmed the absence of carbon outgassing from the quartz
tube, as the same quartz tube has been used for both experiments.

We performed ToF-SIMS experiments to directly verify the existence
of intrinsic carbon inside the copper foil and its depletion to the
surface during annealing under a hydrogen atmosphere. We determined
the carbon concentration profile with respect to the depth from the
surface on P-0, P-6, P-0-6 as well as the untreated copper foil (T-0).
As it can be seen in the intensity profile of the C2 ion
in Figure 2, the carbon
concentration in untreated sample T-0 rapidly declines as a function
of distance from the surface within a few tens of nanometer depth.
This data verifies the carbon content in copper and the profile with
increasing concentration towards the surface supports the proposal
that carbon is embedded in the Cu foil during the rolling and foil
production process. This is somewhat similar to the process of mechanical
alloying of carbon and copper.33 On the
other hand, ToF-SIMS measured more than 1 order of magnitude above
the background level carbon concentration well below the surface in
T-0. The existence of carbon deeper in the foil may be connected with
impurities initially existing in the copper material before the foil
production process. In the P-0 sample, which was annealed for 20 min
without hydrogen, we observe that the carbon profile has undergone
a significant change. The carbon level is reduced throughout the measured
depth and, in particular, there is 2 orders of magnitude reduction
in the carbon level near the surface of P-0 compared to the untreated
foil, T-0. In contrast, 20 min annealing of P-6 under 6 mbar hydrogen
increased its carbon concentration near the surface. Also, compared
to P-0, there is less drop in the carbon level of P-6 below 10 nm.
The very similar depth profile of P-0-6 to P-0 implies a similar mechanism
for the reduction of its carbon content during its first 20 min annealing
step and no effect of hydrogen during its second step of annealing.
Such a transformation in the carbon profile demonstrates the total
depletion of carbon from copper foil in the absence of hydrogen during
annealing but the migration of carbon from the bulk of copper foil
towards its surface during annealing in the presence of hydrogen.

Figure 2 Depth
profile of C2 intensity from ToF-SIMS in untreated
copper foil (T-0) reveals a high concentration of embedded carbon
near the surface. Reduction of C2 intensity in depth profile
of copper foils after annealing confirms out-diffusion of embedded
carbon atoms during annealing. Annealing of copper foil in the absence
of hydrogen releases carbon atoms from P-0 and P-0-6. However, annealing
P-6 in the presence of hydrogen makes the out-diffusing carbon atoms
to be accumulated near the copper surface raising carbon concentration
in the region near the surface (0–10 nm). The similarity of
C2 depth profile in P-0-6 to the depth profile of P-0,
verifies the absence of the carbon content in hydrogen.

Here, we propose a microscopic mechanism that causes
the intrinsic
carbon to migrate and accumulate on the surface of copper foil in
the presence of hydrogen as in the case of sample P-6. At elevated
temperatures on the surface of Cu, H2 dissociate to its
atoms and dissolve in the copper bulk and releases carbon from C–O–Cu
bonds and depletes oxygen in the form of H2O vapor.34 This process reduces the chance of intrinsic
oxygen to scavenge the carbon. Reducing oxygen from the C–O–Cu
bonds in the copper bulk with hydrogen leads to the formation of C–C
molecules, CxHy clusters or individual C atoms. Carbon clusters cannot be accommodated
in the copper lattice. Also, in the absence of oxygen C atoms cannot
easily dissolve in copper.21,35 Therefore, they have
to leave the copper matrix and are expelled to the surface or to the
grain boundaries. As a result, the carbonic compounds segregate to
the surface and agglomerate during annealing under hydrogen. This
proposed mechanism can also explain the earlier observation of the
hydrogen dependency of carbon dissolution and out-diffusion in the
copper film, during the growth of graphene but from the external carbon
precursor.36 When the local concentration
of carbon atoms on the copper surface reaches the supersaturation
level, nucleation of a graphitic film will start.23,37

In the case of annealing, in the absence of hydrogen, intrinsic
oxygen impurities bond with carbon atoms in the bulk and form volatile
CO or CO2 gas to leave the bulk.19 This process efficiently depletes carbon and no carbon film formation
occurs on the P-0 surface.

Moreover, we need to consider that
the carbon and oxygen trapped
inside Cu grain boundaries, voids, or any imperfection sites of Cu
during the foil production or shelf life, may not even chemically
bond to the Cu. Oxygen can also scavenge the carbon inside the Cu
foil in the absence of hydrogen during annealing. However, introducing
hydrogen into the CVD system with high enough concentration can diminish
that process and keep carbon in the bulk.

The results of SEM
and ToF-SIMS analyses obtained from the sample
P-0-6 are also entirely consistent with the above microscopic mechanism
we proposed. During the initial phase of annealing under the same
conditions as sample P-0 oxygen scavenging releases the carbon off
the sample. Therefore, in the second phase of annealing done under
the same conditions as sample P-6, the H-assisted C depletion mechanism
becomes no more relevant simply due to the absence of carbon. Therefore,
ToF-SIMS results perfectly match for P-6 and P-0-6 samples as can
be seen in Figure 2. Consistent with this mechanism and ToF-SIMS results, we observe
no carbon film formation detected on the P-0-6 surface in the SEM
images. This test also proves that there is no role of any external
carbon in the process.

3.2 Nucleation and Growth of
Graphene from Intrinsic
Carbon
The quality of the graphene film grown by CVD is directly
connected with the density of nucleation sites; denser nucleation
leads to smaller crystals and lower quality graphene films. Therefore,
preventing uncontrolled generation of nucleation sites is essential
to improve the CVD process. In this section, we explain our investigation
on whether the segregation of intrinsic carbon on the copper surface
may generate nucleation and growth of graphene. On the basis of our
proposed mechanism, it is expected that the H-assisted C depletion
during the annealing process runs at a faster rate under a higher
hydrogen concentration. Therefore, the formation of the disordered
graphitic film on sample P-6 should be due to the rapid depletion
of carbon species under relatively high hydrogen partial pressure.

Under lower H2 partial pressure, the out-diffusion rate
of C is reduced and its sudden supersaturation is inhibited. Instead,
the nucleation and growth of graphene flakes (GFs) is initiated at
sparsely distributed supersaturation points. In other words, this
provides the growth of a graphitic layer with a longer-range atomic
order. Sample T-40 was annealed under reduced hydrogen partial pressure
of 1.4 mbar and for an extended annealing time of 40 min (Table 2), to attain a growth
condition for GFs with a large enough size to be observed. Figures 3a and S6 display the SEM images of the surface of the
sample T-40 after annealing. Rather than the disordered graphitic
layer seen in sample P-6, micron-sized GFs are formed on the surface
of T-40 due to the reduced carbon supply rate from the copper bulk.
The rate of graphene growth is rather low, that is, after 40 min of
annealing only 33% of the surface of T-40 is covered by GFs. To determine
if full graphene coverage can be achieved, samples T-80 and T-100
were annealed under the same conditions as T-40 but with extended
durations of 80 and 100 min, respectively. As the annealing time is
increased, the GFs grew larger and surface coverages of 63 and 85%
were obtained in the samples T-80 (Figures 3b and S7) and
T-100, respectively (Figures 3c and S8). The Raman spectra taken
from six randomly picked GFs on sample T-100 after they were transferred
on to the SiO2/Si substrate confirm the monolayer graphene
structure in all flakes with slight variation in their quality (Figures 3d and S9).38 To our knowledge,
the formation of neither a disordered graphitic film nor graphene
flakes on copper during the annealing stage in the CVD system has
been reported so far. Figure 4 displays a schematic diagram that summarizes the effect of
the H-assisted C depletion mechanism on copper foil under various
H2 concentrations.

mbar hydrogen partial
pressure for prolonged annealing duration. Reduced hydrogen concentration
leads to the formation of GFs. (a) T-40, 40 min annealing time. Relatively
small GFs; silicon oxide particles are mostly located outside or at
the edge of the GFs. (b) T-80, 80 min and (c) T-100, 100 min annealing
time. The size of GFs slightly increases with the annealing time but
the surface is not fully covered. Even extending the annealing time
beyond 100 min leads to no significant increase. The SEM images of
T-40, T-80, and T-100 in lower magnification can be seen in Figures S6–S8, respectively. (d) The Raman
spectrum of six random flakes on T-100 after transferring to SiO2/Si (all normalized to the G peak). The ratio of 2D/G peaks,
around 2700 and 1600 cm–1, confirm they are monolayer
graphene with slight variation in their quality.

Figure 4 Effect of H-assisted C depletion mechanism on copper foil under
various H2 concentrations. Annealing in the absence of
hydrogen leads to bonding of intrinsic carbon atoms with oxygen impurities,
form volatile CO or CO2 gas and leave the bulk (P-0). This
process efficiently depletes carbon and no carbon film forms on the
surface. Annealing under low H2 pressure (1.4 mbar) slowly
depletes the C atoms from the bulk, hence few locations on the surface
could reach supersaturation and nucleation threshold leading to the
formation of GFs (T-40). Annealing under higher H2 pressure
(6 mbar), the rate of C depletion is increased such that the whole
surface is supersaturated simultaneously, and a disordered graphitic
structure is formed without a long-range atomic order (P-6).

a Samples annealed
under low hydrogen
pressure exhibited nucleation and growth of graphene flakes instead
of graphitic film formation.  Sample T-40E was initially chemical
etched to remove any surface carbon and then was applied the same
annealing process as T-40. Nucleation and growth of graphene
flakes on T-40E just as in the case of the unetched sample T-40 excludes
the effect of surface carbon.

No significant change in the surface coverage of GFs is observed
when the annealing time was extended beyond 100 min. This can be explained
as follows within the scope of the microscopic mechanism we proposed
above: our results verify that carbon originating from the copper
foil facilitates graphene growth, but the growth is limited by the
ability of the carbon in copper to reach the surface at the annealing
temperature. The diffusion rate of carbon to the surface is expected
to follow a continuously declining profile as the graphene flakes
grow and block the access of hydrogen to the copper bulk, suppressing
the release of carbon from C–O–Cu bonds. Therefore,
as the annealing time is extended, the growth rate declines and coverage
tends to saturate.

Depth profiles of carbon concentration in
samples T-0, T-40, T-80,
and T-100, measured with ToF-SIMS, are compared in Figure 5 and its inset. As the annealing
time is increased, the carbon content near the copper surface is increased
while the carbon content in deeper parts is decreased. ToF-SIMS data
directly and independently verifies the migration of carbon towards
the surface. The inset figure shows the variation of carbon concentration
versus annealing time for both near the surface (1.9–110 nm)
and deeper in the bulk (110–300 nm). We observe a saturated
behavior in carbon migration with respect to the annealing time, which
is consistent with the saturation of graphene growth the with annealing
time as explained in the previous paragraph.

80, 100 min treated copper foils (T-0, T-40, T-80, and T-100) under
H2. Comparing C2 profiles in T-40 and T-80 with
respect to T-0, we observe that carbon atoms deep in samples were
depleted but the concentration in the region near the surface (0–55
nm for T-40 and 0–90 nm for T-80) is increased. A similar C2 profile of T-100 to T-80 indicates the slowing down of the
H-assisted C depletion mechanism as graphene flakes grow and block
the access of hydrogen to the copper bulk. Inset shows the variation
of carbon concentration versus annealing time for both near the surface
(1.9–110 nm) and deeper in the bulk (110–300 nm).

In the SEM images shown in Figure 3, we can see some
white particles scattered on the
surface of Cu samples, and their size increases with longer annealing
time. These particles are a compound of silicon and oxygen, originated
from the quartz tube of the furnace.17,39−41 It can be clearly seen that SiOx particles
are never sited at the center of GFs at the earlier stages of graphene
growth. Therefore, we infer that silicon oxide particles are not the
initial cause of graphene nucleation. But the accumulation and segregation
of carbon atoms originating from the bulk of copper facilitate nucleation.

The model we propose in this paper based on our experimental results,
provides a better understanding of why it is difficult to effectively
suppress graphene nucleation without using a tuned oxygen flow in
the CVD process. A diluted oxygen flow before or during the growth
phase suppresses nucleation by etching the “preformed”
GFs, or carbon atoms on supersaturated spots. Hence, the number of
spots which have enough agglomerated carbon for supersaturation to
act as nucleation sites is reduced.

To confirm whether the origin
of the observed GFs on T-40 is the
carbon atoms distributed inside the bulk and not the surface contamination,
we performed an experiment with the chemically cleaned Cu foils. We
etched the surface of a copper foil with acetic acid/hydrogen peroxide
solution to fully remove its outermost layer and the native oxide.21,31,42 The details of this etching process
are given in the Supporting Information (Figures S10 and S11). Immediately after etching, the sample (T-40E)
was annealed for 40 min in the furnace under 1.4 mbar hydrogen, similar
to the process used for T-40 (Table 2). As demonstrated in the SEM image in Figure 6, GFs still appeared on T-40E
after annealing. This provides additional evidence that carbon in
the bulk of Cu foil contributes to the GF formation on the surface
due to H-assisted depletion. We observed that the nucleation density
of GFs was slightly reduced in the chemically etched sample as it
can be seen by comparing Figures 3a and 6. We attribute this reduction
to the removal of high carbon concentration in copper layers just
beneath the surface by chemical etching.

min etched Cu foil in acetic acid/hydrogen
peroxide solution which is then annealed under 500 sccm argon and
50 sccm hydrogen for 40 min as sample T-40. Even after fully removing
the outermost layer and any possible carbon contamination, we observe
spontaneous growth of graphene on the surface.

3.3 Experiments with High Purity Copper Foil
Finally, we used a different type of copper foil (99.999% purity)
to investigate the variation of graphene nucleation with the level
of purity. We repeated annealing and chemical cleaning conditions
of T-40E on a sample labeled HP_T-40E taken from the high purity copper.
Even though it had 2 orders of magnitude higher purity level, nucleation
and growth of GFs are also observed in this sample confirming the
presence of carbon in it (Figure 7). We believe that the rolling technique should again
be the cause of the carbon content. We should note that the purity
level reported by the supplier refers to metallic elements. Thus,
to achieve a reproducible nucleation and growth conditions, the distribution
profile of carbon inside copper foil needs to be considered.

Figure 7 SEM image of
HP_T-40E, the 99.999% pure copper 20 min etched in
acetic acid/hydrogen peroxide and 40 min annealed under 500 sccm argon
and 50 sccm hydrogen similar to T-40E. Compared to T-40E, the higher
purity of HP_T-40E results in lower nucleation density and the coverage
of GFs.

From the distribution of GFs in Figures 3, 6, and 7 we can conclude that carbon
does not seem to be
preferentially segregated along the copper grain boundaries. Also, in Figures 3a, 6, and 7 there
are some nm size dark spots visible beside micron size GFs. We believe
that these features are graphitic or amorphous carbon clusters that
emerged on the surface during the cooling phase as the solubility
of carbon in copper drops with decreasing temperature.35 On the contrary, this kind of dark spots do
not appear in the SEM images of Figure 3b,c. This is due to extended exposure to hydrogen annealing,
after which there was not enough carbon to emerge to the surface and
form such carbon clusters during the cooling phase.

4 Conclusions
In this work, we have demonstrated the aggregation
of carbon atoms
on the surface of copper foil after annealing under hydrogen in the
absence of external carbon sources. Depending on hydrogen partial
pressure, carbon atoms may form either a disordered graphitic film
or graphene on the surface. Despite the fact that the solubility of
carbon atoms inside pure copper is very low, our experimental results
verify that the growth of these carbon-based structures is due to
the presence of intrinsic carbon in the copper bulk. We proposed that
the migration of carbon atoms from inside the copper towards its surface
is induced by hydrogen. This depletion mechanism is independently
verified by measuring C2 intensity versus depth by ToF-SIMS.
The depth profiles of processed and untreated samples demonstrated
the migration of carbon during the annealing process under hydrogen.
We conclude that the nucleation and growth of graphene on copper foil
in CVD cannot be considered as a pure “surface process”,
due to the presence of carbon embedded below the surface during the
foil production process. Therefore, the “competition between
the surface mobility of carbon ad-atoms versus desorption”
of an external precursor does not define the full characteristics
of the nucleation regime of graphene crystals on copper in the CVD
process. One needs to include the out-diffusion of carbon atoms originated
from the inside of copper bulk as well.

The carbon atoms migrating
from the copper bulk to the surface
can be the main cause for the nucleation of graphene crystals rather
than the surface imperfections and impurities such as SiOx particles. We believe that the prematurely nucleated
and grown GFs during the annealing phase under hydrogen become a determinant
factor for the density of growing GFs during the growth phase. Thus,
to achieve a reproducible growth condition, the distribution profile
of carbon inside the copper foil needs to be considered. Accordingly,
the approach for annealing copper foil presented in this paper can
be considered as a method for the initial evaluation of embedded carbon
inside a copper foil and its effect for reproducing a growth recipe.
