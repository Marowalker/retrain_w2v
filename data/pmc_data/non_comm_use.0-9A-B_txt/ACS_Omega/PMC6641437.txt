Diatoms are unicellular
algae of enormous biodiversity that occur in all water habitats on
earth. Their cell walls are composed of amorphous biosilica and exhibit
species-specific nanoporous to microporous and macroporous patterning.
Therefore, diatom biosilica is a promising renewable material for
various applications, such as in catalysis, drug-delivery systems,
and biophotonics. In this study, diatom biosilica of three different
species (Stephanopyxis turris, Eucampia zodiacus, and Thalassiosira
pseudonana) was used as support material for gold
nanoparticles using a covalent coupling method. The resulting catalysts
were applied for the oxidation of d-glucose to d-gluconic acid. Because of its high specific surface area, well-established
transport pores, and the presence of small, homogeneously distributed
gold nanoparticles on the surface, diatom biosilica provides a highly
catalytically active surface and advanced accessibility to the active
sites. In comparison to those of the used reference supports, higher
catalytic activities (up to 3.28 × 10–4 mmolGlc s–1 mgAu–1 for T. pseudonana biosilica) and
slower deactivation were observed for two of the diatom biosilica
materials. In addition, diatom biosilica showed very high gold-loading
capacities (up to 45 wt %), with a homogeneous nanoparticle distribution.

==== Body
Introduction
The oceans of the world
are home to a large number of micrometer-sized,
single-celled organisms. This so-called phytoplankton is the origin
of the food chain in the marine ecosystem. One of the largest phytoplankton
classes is diatoms, which are special unicellular eukaryotic algae.1 Their cell walls consist of amorphous biosilica,
which exhibits a species-specific micro and nano patterning. These
cell walls, also called valves, are formed by a biomineralization
process, which is a subject of ongoing research.2−5

Because of its outstanding
properties, diatom biosilica has recently
attracted increasing research interest. It exhibits ordered porous
structures with a relatively high specific surface area (SSA), pore
volume, biocompatibility, thermal stability, and chemical inertness.6 It is built by biomineralization at a neutral
pH as well as at an ambient temperature and pressure in an aqueous
environment. Moreover, diatom biosilica is a renewable material, which
can be produced in high quantity and purity without massive energy
and material effort. Therefore, diatom biosilica can be an interesting
alternative to synthetic silica materials for several applications,
especially in catalysis, optics, and biophotonics, drug-delivery systems,
or microfluidic applications.7 For example,
Zhang et al. used palladium nanoparticles supported on diatomite to
catalyze the Heck and Suzuki reaction.8 Platinum nanoparticles covalently coupled to diatom biosilica of
the species Stephanopyxis turris were
used in the catalysis of the redox reaction of hexacyanoferrate and
sodium thiosulfate.9 Moreover, Sandhage
et al. converted diatom biosilica into other materials (e.g., carbon10 and titania11) and
used the resulting diatom-shaped materials for different catalytic
reactions.

Biosilica is abundantly available as diatomaceous
earth (DE) from
the mining industry at a reasonable cost (∼30 €/kg Sigma
Aldrich). However, DE contains a lot of impurities, random structures
from various diatom species, and broken valves.12,13 For size-selective applications (e.g., in catalysis or filtration),
it is preferable to use one pristine diatom species of a defined and
well-preserved structure.

Catalysis is a key technology for
industrial production and biotechnological
reactions. Of all chemicals, 90% are produced via catalytic processes
or intermediate steps. Especially, heterogeneous catalysis is advantageous
because the separation of the catalyst from the reaction products
is simple. Moreover, catalyst recycling is relatively easy.14 Therefore, the investigation of suitable catalyst
support materials has become increasingly important over the last
few decades.

In this work, the properties of diatom species
in comparison to
those of synthetic silica and DE as catalyst supports in the gold-catalyzed
oxidation of d-glucose to d-gluconic acid have been
investigated. d-gluconic acid is an important chemical intermediate
in the pharmaceutical industry, in paper and concrete production,
as well as in the food industry. Its worldwide production amounts
to 100 000 t/year.15−17 Beyond enzymatic oxidation of d-glucose, recent developments have shown the great potential
of heterogeneous noble metal catalysts for d-gluconic acid
production. Different support materials, such as carbon, silica, and
alumina, were successfully used in heterogeneous glucose oxidation,
with differences in conversion, product selectivity, and long-life
stability. For example, catalytic conversion with silica-supported
catalysts yields no byproduct, in contrast to carbon-supported catalytic
conversion under alkaline conditions, during which fructose and other
sugar molecules are also formed (up to 50%).17 In particular, gold has received increasing interest for selective
oxidation of functional groups (alcohols or aldehydes).18 Compared with biocatalytic systems, gold catalysts
enable oxidation under mild conditions and over a wide range of pH’s.
Furthermore, they provide a higher conversion and selectivity as well
as a lower deactivation compared to those of other noble metals, such
as platinum or palladium.15,18 Because only small
gold nanoparticles with diameters of 4–7 nm showed excellent
activity in oxidation reactions,19−23 presynthesized gold nanoparticles of defined size
were coupled to silica in this work. This procedure has already been
established for silica materials,24 especially
for diatom biosilica, by different groups.9,25,26 Because of the unique diatom structure,
catalysts with well-dispersed nanoparticles could be synthesized,
showing promising performance in the oxidation of d-glucose.

Results
and Discussion
Structures of Different Silica Materials
Biosilica
from three different diatom species was investigated: Stephanopyxis turris (S. turris, ST), Eucampia zodiacus (E. zodiacus, EZ), and Thalassiosira
pseudonana (T. pseudonana, TP). Diatoms were cultivated in artificial seawater under defined
conditions, as described in the Supporting Information. After cell wall extraction in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)/ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA), calcination was performed for 5 h at 550 °C
under air atmosphere. This treatment led to the formation of pure
silica and maintained the unique structure of the diatom cell walls.
All investigated species are saltwater diatoms, which belong to the
class Centrales. S. turris is the largest species, with a valve diameter of about 50 μm.
The valves exhibit a hierarchical pore architecture and show a honeycomb-like
structure with hexagonal chambers and a silica layer with a highly
regular pore pattern at the bottom (Figure 1a,d).26,27 Calcined S. turris biosilica has a SSA of 56 m2 g–1 and a pore volume of 0.15 cm3 g–1 (Table 2). E. zodiacus biosilica exhibits
submicron-sized pores of squared appearance, which further exhibit
an array of even smaller pores (Figure 1b,e). T. pseudonana has cell walls of sizes between 5 and 10 μm. The valves are
cylindrical and contain ridges and pores with relatively uniform diameters
of approximately 20 nm. Rimoportulae and fultoportulae with tubelike
structures are located at the rim of each valve and in the central
area (Figure 1c,f).3 Calcined biosilica of E. zodiacus and T. pseudonana exhibit SSAs of
approximately 100 m2 g–1 and pore volumes
of 0.30 and 0.40 cm3 g–1, respectively
(Table 2).

a After complete deactivation.

All three diatom species show a specific macroporous structure,
which is not entirely detected with the nitrogen physisorption measurements
but may be favorable for diffusion processes during the catalytic
reaction. The silica itself exhibits mainly mesopores and a remarkably
high SSA. These structural features are quite unique for an inorganic
material of natural origin and make diatom biosilica a promising support
material for heterogeneous catalysis.

Silica beads (SB) synthesized
by the Stoeber method have a spherical
shape and an average size of 200–300 nm (Figure 2a,d). Because of the dense structure of the
spheres, the material shows a SSA of 34 m2 g–1 and a total pore volume of 0.15 cm3 g–1. Mesocellular foam (MCF) (Figure 2b,e) exhibits disordered mesopores in the range of
20–50 nm and has a SSA of 677 m2 g–1. DE contains various remnants from different diatom species and
numerous impurities (Figure 2c,f). It exhibits a SSA of 38 m2 g–1 and a total pore volume of 0.15 cm3 g–1. Nitrogen physisorption isotherms of all silica materials are presented
in Figure S1.

d), MCF (b, e), and DE (c, f).

Structure of the Catalysts
To immobilize the catalytically
active nanoparticles on silica materials, a covalent coupling method
using presynthesized gold nanoparticles was used, as reported earlier
by our group.9,26

To investigate the effect
of different Au-NP loadings, the biosilica of T. pseudonana was loaded with 3–15 wt % of gold. As expected, the transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) measurements show an increased density of
Au-NPs on the silica surface (Figure 3). Surprisingly, all samples show only small amounts
of agglomerates of Au-NPs, independent of the gold content. The majority
of gold nanoparticles is well dispersed on the diatom surface. Unexpectedly,
the sample with the lowest loading shows several agglomerates. Obviously,
the high SSA and unique structure of the biosilica from T. pseudonana allow uniform distribution of
separated Au-NPs even at high gold loadings of up to 15 wt %.

Figure 3 TEM images
of T. pseudonana biosilica
with different Au-NP loadings: 3.4 wt % (a), 6.9 wt % (b), 8.1 wt
% (c), and 15.1 wt % (d).

Besides varying Au-NP loadings, several silica templates
of natural
or synthetic origin were loaded with 15 wt % gold. Despite the use
of a high gold content, well-dispersed Au-NP monolayers of 3–7
nm were observed on the silica surface of all biosilica materials
(Figure 4). Especially,
the diatom biosilica samples show a rather uniform distribution of
Au-NPs on the entire surface (Figure 4a–c,e–g). Even the delicate internal
silica structures in the pores of E. zodiacus biosilica are homogeneously covered with Au-NPs (Figure 4f). The nanoparticles exhibit
a narrow size distribution due to the use of well-defined presynthesized
nanoparticles. For diatom biosilica, the particle size distribution
is shown in Figure 4i–k. Surprisingly, the biosilica of S. turris shows a slightly higher average particle size (5.28 nm) than the
biosilica of the other diatom species, E. zodiacus and T. pseudonana (4.32 and 4.39 nm).
This may be explained by a slightly higher agglomeration tendency.
In general, however, Au-NPs on the biosilica materials do not exhibit
excessive agglomeration. In contrast, large agglomerates of gold located
between Au-NP-coupled silica spheres are observed for the synthetic
SB in TEM measurements (Figure 4d). This is due to the high gold content and low SSA provided
by this support. MCF is filled with Au-NPs immobilized inside mesopores. TEM measurements do not show significant
amounts of gold agglomerates in synthetic MCF (Figure 4h). DE exhibits a lower capacity for loading
of Au-NPs. It is not able to support comparable amounts of gold to
those by other silica materials. DE was saturated at a gold loading
of only approximately 6 wt %. This means that the number of Au-NPs
that can be immobilized on the surface using the covalent coupling
method is limited. The intrinsic inhomogeneities within this material
result in a rather inhomogeneous nanoparticle distribution (Figure 4l). Some valves are
completely covered with Au-NPs and agglomerates whereas others are
completely empty. Strong agglomeration of Au-NPs on the material (Figure S2) may reduce the catalytic activity
of Au/DE by decreasing the active surface.

Au-NP-coupled S. turris (a,e), E. zodiacus (b, f), and T. pseudonana (c, g) biosilica; SB (d), MCF (h),
and DE (l);
and Au-NP distribution of S. turris (i), E. zodiacus (j), and T. pseudonana (k) biosilica (15 wt %).

In summary, the cultivated diatom cells exhibit
well-defined silica
structures with a high purity and surface area, which can be beneficial
for the catalytic behavior compared to that of commercially available
DE and the SB. The silica surface of diatom biosilica is well suited
for a homogeneous and uniform distribution of the coupled nanoparticles.
Moreover, smaller Au-NPs and only a limited amount of agglomerates
are observed, leading to a surface with a higher catalytic activity.

d-Glucose Oxidation Using Different Gold Loadings
The oxidation of d-glucose is catalyzed by Au-NPs of sizes
below 5 nm.19−23 The selectivity of the reaction under the used conditions is known
from the literature.17,18,30,31 To confirm this for the Au/biosilica catalyst
materials, HPAEC measurements were performed for one sample (T. pseudonana 15 wt % Au). The results show that
the reaction solution after catalysis is composed of d-glucose
and d-gluconic acid exclusively (see Figure S3). To investigate the influence of different gold
loadings on the catalytic behavior, the biosilica of T. pseudonna was coupled with variable amounts (3–15
wt %) of Au-NPs. All catalyst samples show comparable specific catalytic
activity related to the amount of gold. Small deviations are explained
by small differences in the amount of agglomerated gold. The amount
of converted d-glucose and the resulting catalytic activities
for different gold loadings are shown in Figure 5a and Table 1.

Figure 5 Catalytic activity at different gold loadings (a). Relationship
between Au loading and activity of the catalyst (b).

The higher the d-glucose to Au ratio,
the faster the deactivation
occurs, resulting in significant differences in the amount of converted d-glucose. This means that the higher the amount of Au-NPs,
the higher the conversion related to the whole catalyst (see Figure S4). A linear correlation between gold
loading and catalytic activity is observed in this loading range (Figure 5b). TEM images (Figure 3) of the samples
show that even at high gold loadings, the nanoparticles are well dispersed
and have a size below 5 nm, which is essential for high catalytic
activity. Additionally, they are well accessible for the reactants.
Thus, Au/biosilica catalysts are clearly different from conventional
catalysts, which show a considerable drop in catalytic activity with
increasing gold loading. For example, Au/Al2O3 catalysts reported by Baatz et al.15 show
a reduction in the activity by 1 order of magnitude when increasing
the amount of gold from 0.06 to 10 wt %.

d-Glucose Oxidation
Using Different Silica Materials
For all silica materials,
a gold loading of approximately 15 wt
% was targeted. The gold loadings determined by ICP-OES measurements
for the different samples are shown in Table 2. The normalized conversion
curves of d-glucose are shown in Figure 6. All catalysts (except for DE) exhibit high
activity in d-glucose oxidation. Especially, diatom
biosilica serves as an excellent support material for active Au-NPs
in the catalytic oxidation of d-glucose. To the best of our
knowledge, these are the first reported active gold-based d-glucose oxidation catalysts with diatom biosilica as a support material.

catalysts with different silicas as support materials.

Biosilica of the different
species show significantly higher catalytic
activity compared to that of the established silica reference materials
and at least similar catalytic activity compared to that of the tailored
porous synthetic silica material MCF with a high mesoporosity (Figure 6 and Table 2). The open, porous structure
of T. pseudonana, with transport pores
exceeding 20 nm; the high pore volume; and the high SSA contribute
to the highest catalytic activity of 3.28 10–4 mmolGlc s–1 mgAu–1. The structural characteristics of this diatom species enable the
deposition of 15 wt % small Au-NPs without noticeable agglomeration,
resulting in a large number of catalytic active sites and thereby
high catalytic performance. A similar behavior can be observed with S. turris and E. zodiacus biosilica. However, the biosilica of S. turris exhibits a slightly lower catalytic activity, which is probably
due to the lower SSA and pore volume and the higher average nanoparticle
size.

Because of the macroporous structure of diatom biosilica,
the active
sites are well accessible for the reactants. This leads to beneficial
diffusion of d-glucose into the Au-NPs, yielding higher initial
catalytic activities, and to diffusion of d-gluconic acid
away from the Au-NPs immobilized on the silica surface, which may
be advantageous for reduced deactivation of the catalysts.

For
the deactivation of metal catalyst in alcohol oxidations, several
deactivation mechanisms have been identified: decarbonylation (CO
formation), sintering/crystalline growth, overoxidation, self-limiting
reaction, and metal dissolution (leaching). No sintering or leaching
effects were observed on the investigated catalysts, as could be proven
by TEM/REM measurements performed before and after the catalytic test
as well as heterogeneity tests. Overoxidation, the so-called oxygen
poisoning of the metal surface, where the surface is partially covered
by chemisorbed oxygen, is an accepted deactivation mechanism for metal
catalysts, especially Pt and Pd catalysts.32,33 Metals with a higher redox potential are less prone to oxidation.
This explains why Au catalysts show higher resistance to oxygen poising
during alcohol oxidation.34−38 Decarbonylation was investigated by several groups,39,40 which found that CO formation is only observed under oxygen mass
transport limited conditions for certain compounds like aromatic alcohols
and aldehydes. Abbadi et al.41 revealed
that d-gluconic acid, the reaction product, and not CO is
the main poisoning species. The poisoning effect of d-gluconic
acid (self-limiting reaction) was reported by several groups.17,33,41−43d-Gluconic
acid caps the Au-NP surface, thus decreasing the accessible catalytically
active surface and hence the reaction process. In this context, effective
mass transport of d-gluconic acid from the surface can have
a significant influence on the deactivation process.

MCF shows
a catalytic activity of 1.63 × 10–4 mmolGlc s–1 mgAu–1, which is comparable to that of S. turris biosilica. Because of the well-connected mesopore system, MCF provides
good mass transport and shows a slightly later deactivation than that
of S. turris biosilica. Moreover, the
nanoparticles are well distributed in MCF due to the high SSA and
large pore volume of the synthetic silica material. However, considering
the 7 times higher SSA of MCF, the high activities of biosilica are
very surprising. T. pseudonana and E. zodiacus are even more active than MCF, a synthetic
high-end silica material. SB exhibit a lower catalytic activity of
1.12 × 10–4 mmolGlc s–1 mgAu–1 in the conversion of d-glucose due to significant agglomeration of the Au-NPs (Figure 4d). DE shows almost
no measurable conversion of d-glucose. This is probably caused
by the inhomogeneous structures of DE, which result in an inhomogeneous
nanoparticle distribution. Furthermore, nanoparticle agglomerates
were visible in the TEM measurements for this material. Moreover,
DE is already saturated at a loading of only approximately 6 wt %
gold. The lower gold content and heterogeneous distribution of Au-NPs
on the surface with agglomerates are convincing reasons for the observed
low catalytic activity.

To evaluate the stability of the catalyst
and possible leaching
effects, the active catalysts were investigated in a heterogeneity
test. The catalyst was separated after 600 s from the reaction solution
by filtration, and the reaction was continued without the catalyst
for another 600 s. After removing the catalyst, no further conversion
of d-glucose to d-gluconic acid takes place (Figure 7). This means that
no active Au-NPs are found in the solution, indicating that the Au-NPs
are indeed tightly attached to the silica surface during the reaction.

Figure 7 Heterogeneity
test with MCF, S. turris, E. zodiacus, and T. pseudonana biosilica with 15 wt % gold loading.

Hence, all catalytic experiments show that the use of diatom
biosilica
from a single species as a catalyst support is highly preferable.
Compared to synthetic silica like silica beads with only a third of
the activity, MCF with comparable or less activity than DE, shows
no measureable activity. Diatom species provide higher initial catalytic
activity due to well dispersed Au-NPs and slower deactivation of the
catalyst probably due to favorable advanced mass transport.

High Gold
Loadings
In further experiments, the possibility
of loading the biosilica materials with maximum amounts of gold until
saturation was tested to investigate whether these materials still
showed catalytic activity. The biosilica of E. zodiacus was able to take up 45 wt % of gold, and the other biosilica materials
reach amounts of about 30 wt % (Table 3). Despite the high loadings, only a few agglomerates
could be observed in the TEM measurements. The nanoparticles are still
homogeneously distributed and show sizes in the range of 3–7
nm (Figure S5). All materials exhibit decreasing
catalytic activity related to the amount of gold as compared to that
of the catalysts with gold loadings of 15 wt % and below. The biosilica
of E. zodiacus shows the strongest
decrease in catalytic activity. This is probably due to the fact that
it exhibits the highest gold loading among all of the materials, which
causes the highest degree of agglomeration (see TEM measurements in Figure S5). However, because of the high gold
loadings, the catalytic activity related to the amount of catalyst
material used is nevertheless very high (Table 3). This behavior indicates the potential
for industrial application. For example, in batch reactors, high capacities
of active material are essential. These require a high loading of
support material with catalytically active centers. Au/diatom catalysts
exhibit a high catalytic activity of more than 5 × 10–5 mmolGlc s–1 mgCat–1 even at gold loadings of more than 40 wt %. In contrast to
the known gold-supported catalysts from Baatz et al.15 or Önal et al.17 with
an activity of 3 × 10–5 mmolGlc s–1 mgCat–1, biosilica-based
catalysts show excellent activities. Moreover, the macroporous structure
allows good accessibility to the active sites.

Chemicals
Gold(III) chloride trihydrate, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl)carbo
diimide (EDC), and SDS were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS),
and sodium borohydride obtained from Merck, EDTA from Gruessing, trisodium
citrate dihydrate from Acros organics, d-glucose from Roth,
and (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (APTMS) from Alfa Aesar were used
as received. DE was purchased from Supelco (calcined, purified).

Diatom Cultivation and Purification of Diatom Biosilica
Diatom species S. turris, E. zodiacus, and T. pseudonana were used. These species were grown as reported elsewhere.26 Detailed procedures for the cultivation of S. turris, E. zodiacus, and T. pseudonana can be found in
the Supporting Information.

Cell
wall extraction was performed as described by Hedrich et al.27 To remove physically bound organic material
from the cell walls, an aqueous buffer containing EDTA (0.1 mol L–1) and SDS (2 wt %) at pH 8 was used. The harvested
cells were resuspended in 20 mL SDS/EDTA solution and heated to 95 °C
for 10 min. This treatment was repeated three times. Finally, the
biosilica was washed thrice with Milli-Q water. After all steps, the
biosilica was separated from the supernatant by centrifugation (Heraeus
biofuge primo, swinging bucket rotor, 2500 RCF, 10 min). After extraction,
the samples were freeze-dried.

To remove the remaining organic
material from the biosilica, calcination
was performed in a muffle furnace (Nabertherm) for 5 h at 550 °C
under static air atmosphere.

Synthetic Silica Materials
SB were
synthesized by the
Stoeber method.28 In a 250 mL flask, 12.5
mL of concentrated ammonia and 8 g of TEOS were added to 125 mL of
ethanol (EtOH) and stirred for 12 h. The resulting SB were washed
three times with EtOH and freeze-dried overnight. The material was
calcined under the same conditions as those for biosilica.

MCF
was synthesized as reported by Schmidt-Winkel et al.29

Preparation of the Catalyst
Gold
nanoparticles (Au-NPs)
were synthesized as reported by Jantschke et al.,26 which is described in the Supporting Information. To immobilize the Au-NPs on the silica surface,
a covalent coupling method was applied.9 Before nanoparticle coupling, all silica materials were dried in
vacuum for at least 12 h at 80 °C. The silica material (100 mg)
was mixed with 8 mL of 3 vol % APTMS in 95 vol % methanol (MeOH) and
ultrasonicated for 15 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was
removed and the material was washed three times with MeOH, followed
by heating for 1 h in 10 mL of MeOH under reflux. After cooling
and centrifugation, 200 μL of phosphate-buffered saline (pH
7.4), 600 μL of 0.025 mol L–1 NHS/EDC, and
the concentrated gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs) were added to the silica
and sonicated for 15 min. Finally, the silica materials were washed
three times with water and freeze-dried for 12 h. The amount of concentrated
Au-NPs on the support (measured with ICP-OES) ranged from 3 to 45
wt %.

Catalyst Characterization
Nitrogen physisorption isotherms
were measured at 196 °C on a Quadrasorb apparatus (Quantachrome
Instruments). SSAs were calculated using the multipoint BET equation
(p/p0 = 0.05–0.2).
Total pore volumes (micropores and mesopores) were calculated at p/p0 = 0.99.

SEM analyses
were performed on a Hitachi SU 8000 field-emission scanning electron
microscope. Droplets of water suspensions of the samples were placed
on sample holders equipped with a carbon tap and dried.

ICP-OES
was carried out on an ICP-OES PerkinElmer Optima 7000DV
instrument to determine the amount of gold and silicon in the samples,
with a plasma flow of 15 L min–1 at standard temperature
and a pressure of 6.5 bar and a 1400 W HF generator output. Silicon
was detected radially at 288.158 nm, and gold was detected axially
at a spectral line of 267.595 nm. The flow rate was 1.3 mL min–1. The decomposition procedure of samples is described
in the Supporting Information.

The
size and distribution of the metal nanoparticles on diatoms
were characterized with transmission electron microscopes Libra 120
and Libra 200 MC (Zeiss). Libra 120 was operated at an acceleration
voltage of 120 kV and was equipped with the LaB6 filament.
The images were acquired with a CCD camera from Tröndle Restlichtverstärker
Systeme and iTEM software (Olympus). Libra 200 MC was operated at
an acceleration voltage of 200 kV and is equipped with the Schottky
filament and Ω monochromator. The images were acquired with
CCD camera TemCam-F416 and EM-MENU4 software of Tietz Video and Image
Processing Systems. The nanoparticle size distribution was calculated
with Image J software.

d-Glucose Oxidation
The
prepared gold/silica
catalysts were tested in d-glucose oxidation as a model reaction.
The experiments were carried out in a three-necked flask thermostated
at 45 °C, with 40 mL of 0.05 mol L–1d-glucose solution and continuous stirring at 1000 rpm. Oxygen was
bubbled through the solution with a flow rate of 500 mL min–1 at atmospheric pressure. Before starting the reaction, the pH was
adjusted to slightly above 9 by adding 0.1 mol L–1 NaOH solution. The reaction was started by adding 10 mg of catalyst
(suspended in 5 mL of water) to the d-glucose solution. During
the experiment, the pH of the reaction suspension was kept constant
at 9 using TitroLine α plus (SI Analytics) with Titrisoft 2.7
software (Fisher Scientific) by titration with 0.1 mol L–1 NaOH solution. All experiments were repeated three times, and the
results showed only little variation for the different samples (less
than 5% for the catalytic activities). The shown data represent the
average of all measurements. As reported elsewhere,17,18,30,31 the selectivity
of d-glucose oxidation to d-gluconic acid is close
to 100% under the applied conditions, which allows direct calculation
of the yield of d-gluconic acid from the titration curve. Selectivity measurements were performed
with HPAEC and are provided in the Supporting Information. The activity was calculated from the slope of
the titration curve before deactivation occurred regarding the amount
of used catalyst and used gold. The specific activity related to the
metal content (mmolGlc s–1 mgAu–1) was used for comparison of catalysts with different
gold contents.

To investigate the stability of the catalyst
and leaching effects with additional experiments, the catalyst was
separated from the reaction solution after 600 s by filtration. The
reaction was continued without the catalyst for another 600 s.

Conclusions
For the first time, we present the use of naturally occurring silica
materials as renewable support material for the catalytic oxidation
of d-glucose to d-gluconic acid with Au-NPs. Using
a covalent coupling method, presynthesized Au-NPs with a diameter
of 4–7 nm could be successfully immobilized onto the silica
surface. TEM measurements showed that especially diatom biosilica
provides well-dispersed nanoparticles on the silica surface. The good
adhesion of Au-NPs on silica support and therefore the absence of
leaching phenomena were proven by heterogeneity tests. High SSAs;
favorable transport pores; and small, homogeneously distributed gold
nanoparticles on the biosilica surface led to the formation of surfaces
with high catalytic activity and good accessibility to the active
sites. As a consequence, the highest catalytic activity was obtained
for the two of diatom biosilica materials from E. zodiacus and T. pseudonana. They showed
higher activities and slower deactivation than reference silica materials
like SB and DE. Even the synthetic high-end material MCF, which has
a very high SSA and mesopore volume, showed activity lower than or
similar to that of the Au-NP loaded diatom biosilica. Moreover, diatom
biosilica has a very high capacity of gold loading as well as a homogeneous
nanoparticle distribution and good accessibility to the active sites,
due to the macroporous structure. These properties render diatom biosilica
a promising sustainable support material for heterogeneous catalysts
in industrial applications. More than 100 000 diatom species
are known, and all of them exhibit different natural structures. Considerable
progress has been made in upscaling cultivation, for example, growing
diatoms in large tanks, photobioreactors, or in outside ponds.44 Because of the increasing industrial uses of
algae and their products (e.g., oil for fuel and as fertilizers),
their production is likely to increase further in the next few years.
Diatom biosilica may thus become available as a cheap byproduct of
this growing industry.
