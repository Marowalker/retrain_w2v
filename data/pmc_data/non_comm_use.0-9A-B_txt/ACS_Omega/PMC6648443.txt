A water
contact angle greater than 150° together with a sliding
angle less than 10° is a special surface phenomenon that appears
on superhydrophobic surfaces. In this paper, a brief introduction
of the development history and present research on superhydrophobic
surfaces was given. Polymeric superhydrophobic surfaces with biomimetic
hierarchical roughness were fabricated by a simple method of hot embossing
without any chemical treatments. Stainless steel meshes with different
mesh numbers were used as template. Moreover, the influences of processing
parameters, including mesh number, mold temperature, and pressure,
were deeply investigated. Hierarchical microplatforms, microfibers,
and oriented arrayed nanowrinkles structure on them, which were resembled
with the nanowrinkles structure and hierarchical roughness on a red
rose petal, were observed by a scanning electron microscope. A water
contact angle of 154° can be achieved after parameter optimization.
The method proposed in this study offered a fine and affordable choice
for the fabrication of polymeric superhydrophobic surfaces. With the
rapid development of functional applications in micro- and nanodevices,
this method will show greater superiority in large-area and large-scale
production due to its advantages of low cost, high efficiency, and
high reliability.

1 Introduction
Compared with the pioneer
research work around the turn of the
century,1−3 the fabrication and fundamental of superhydrophobic
surfaces have been extensively studied in recent years.4−8 Superhydrophobic surfaces are typically defined as surfaces with
contact angles of water droplets greater than 150° and sliding
angles less than 10°. This rapid expansion of research interest
is because of their great application potential in the area of rain,
snow, or ice adhesion prevention;9,10 drag reduction;11 antibiofouling;12,13 tunable isotropic
or anisotropic wettability surfaces;14−16 etc. The research of
superhydrophobic surfaces is often inspired by natural examples, such
as the water repellency and self-cleaning effect of plant leaves and
insect wings.17−21 One of the most well-known examples is the so-called “lotus
effect”, which can realize self-cleaning using rolling water
drops to remove pollutants and dust.22,23 Basing on
the research on natural superhydrophobic phenomenon, artificial superhydrophobic
surface was more controllable under the combination of low-surface-energy
materials or coatings and designed hierarchical roughness on both
micro- and nanoscales.24−26 Numerous methods for artificial superhydrophobic
surfaces fabrication, including chemical composition control and fabrication
techniques, such as self-assembly,27,28 spin coating,29 electrospinning,30 etching,31 imprint lithography,32 etc., have been developed to reduce surface
energy and generate hierarchical roughness.2,33−36

Hierarchical roughness is a catch-all for all types of combined
structure ranging from microscale to nanoscale.37 Numerous kinds of hierarchical structures, both natural
and artificial, are conducive to the increase of contact angle toward
superhydrophobic surfaces. Among the fabricating techniques listed
above, imprint lithography is often used in the preparation of superhydrophobic
surfaces with hierarchical structures because of its high precision,
high fidelity, and simplicity.20,38 Liu et al. reported
an imprint lithography approach to transfer complex micro/nanostructures
into polymeric materials with an aluminum oxide mold.39 Lee’s group prepared overhang structures using reverse
nanoimprint lithography with poly(vinyl alcohol) transfer template.
A fluoroalkylsilane monolayer coating was further performed to reduce
the surface energy to form superhydrophobic surfaces on silicon substrates.40 Many biomimetic hierarchical structures, such
as red rose petal, butterfly wing, gecko foot, and plant leaf structures,41,42 have also been replicated by imprint lithography with either natural
material or artificially patterned molds.

Beyond ordered hierarchical
structures, the spontaneous surface
wrinkling technique43,44 developed in recent years provides
an alternative way to create textured structures on both micro- and
nanoscales. Researchers around the world have made many efforts to
fabricate hierarchical wrinkle and fold structures for the realization
of controllable wetting characteristics. To date, external stress
or strain under appropriate conditions is considered to be an effective
way to fabricate hierarchically wrinkled surfaces.45 Some other techniques such as plasma treatment, thermally
induced shrinkage, and imprint lithography are also applied combining
with spontaneous wrinkling for better controllability. Lee et al.46 transformed flat polystyrene substrates into
superhydrophobic hierarchically wrinkled surfaces by sequential wrinkling
process. Plasma treatments followed by directional strain relief were
performed to control the nanowrinkle orientation and wavelength. Zhang
et al.47 explored the formation mechanism
of hierarchically wrinkled surfaces, which can be controlled between
superhydrophobicity and superhydrophilicity by mechanical strain.
The relationship between different contact states and levels of hierarchical
roughness was also discussed. Moreover, superhydrophobic surfaces
with hierarchical roughness, such as combinations of wrinkles with
micropillars, microplatforms, microfibers, etc., have been successfully
fabricated and comprehensively studied.48−50

Although the aforementioned
techniques could generate superhydrophobic
surfaces with hierarchical roughness, the preparation of hierarchically
structured superhydrophobic products still cannot meet the demands
of large-scale industrialization (e.g., efficiently, massively, and
cheaply). Therefore, it is worthwhile to develop efficient, controllable,
and affordable techniques to fabricate optimized hierarchically structured
surfaces and further promote the research depth on their hydrophobic
characteristics.

In this paper, we select the hot embossing
method, which can be
regarded as a special type of imprint lithography, to fabricate polymeric
superhydrophobic surfaces with biomimetic hierarchical structures.
Hierarchical microplatforms, microfibers, and oriented arrayed nanowrinkles
structures, which are similar to the wrinkled surfaces of red rose
petal, are generated on polymer substrates under precisely controlled
temperature and pressure. As a kind of top-down approach, the hot
embossing method has the advantages of easy handling, high efficiency,
high fidelity, and low cost.51,52 Extra large (>feet2) products with superior hydrophobic performance can be obtained
within 1 min with no chemical treatment. The application of commercial
polymer substrate and stainless steel mesh template makes the fabrication
of superhydrophobic surfaces really repeatable and affordable. The
size of products with biomimetic hierarchical roughness can be even
larger when larger polymer substrate, mesh template, and hot embossing
equipment are used. Therefore, this method is ideal for mass industrial
production of polymeric superhydrophobic surfaces.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Formation and Evolution
of the Biomimetic
Hierarchical Roughness
The surface morphology of final product
was determined by the combination of stainless steel mesh and the
processing parameters of hot embossing. The diameter of the wire mesh
and mesh size, which are influenced by the mesh number, would directly
affect the size of the microplatform structure in final product. Meanwhile,
the processing parameters (e.g., embossing temperature and pressure)
would greatly influence the formation and evolution of microfiber
and nanowrinkle structures. The specifications of stainless steel
mesh had already been standardized. Here, meshes with mesh numbers
of 300, 400, 500, 800, 1000, and 1500 were selected for hot embossing
experiments. Figure 1a shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the pristine
stainless steel mesh with a mesh number of 300.

Figure 1 (a) SEM image of the
pristine stainless steel mesh with a mesh
number of 300; (b, c) the as-prepared surfaces using same template
showing totally different morphologies under varying processing parameters;
(d) regularly arranged nanowrinkles on microfiber structures; (e)
SEM image of the nanowrinkles on red rose petal; and (f) the formation
and evolution process of the special biomimetic hierarchical structures.

Two SEM images of the as-prepared
surfaces using same template
are presented in Figure 1b,c. Although the template of these two samples was the same, different
processing parameters, especially different embossing temperatures,
led to totally different morphological characteristics. When the embossing
temperature was lower than the melting temperature (Tm) of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) and polyethylene (PE),
the structure of the surface was mainly microplatforms, which were
basically of the same size with the meshes (as shown in Figure 1b). The microplatform structures
can be regarded as notches of the stainless steel meshes on polymer
substrates caused by mechanical compression and embedding. With the
increase of embossing temperature, polymer substrate (especially the
EVA phase) would have stronger deformability and mobility, which led
to total variation of the microplatform structures. Figure 1c presents the morphology of
sample prepared under embossing temperature several degrees higher
than in Figure 1b.
Obviously, almost all of the microplatforms changed into microfibers.
More details on the surface of microfibers can be found under higher
magnification (30 K). As shown in Figure 1d, nanowrinkle array with a cycle of ∼100
nm, which was very similar to the nanowrinkle structures on red rose
petal (Figure 1e),
was regularly arranged along the axial direction of microfiber. The
nanowrinkles together with microplatforms and microfibers formed by
the hot embossing process constituted the needed hierarchical roughness
for superhydrophobic surfaces. The formation and evolution process
of this special biomimetic hierarchical structure is revealed in Figure 1f. First, the stainless
steel mesh and PE substrate were prepared under room temperature and
then put into the hot embossing device together. Second, they were
embossed and held for a certain time under predefined embossing temperature
and pressure. During this step, the mesh would be gradually pressed
into PE substrate and the morphology should be similar to the one
presented in Figure 1b. After that, the demolding step (peeling the mesh off PE substrate)
was performed immediately in the case of incomplete cooling. To get
perfect microfibers and nanowrinkles on them, the embossing temperature
should be set at certain values that are slightly higher than the Tm of EVA and lower than the Tm of PE. On account of the strong deformability and mobility
of melting EVA, the gaps of stainless steel mesh could be fully filled,
and the polymer (both EVA and PE) attached on net wires would be stretched
and turned into the microfibers in Figure 1c, while unmelted PE phase held the whole
substrate together and kept it from falling apart. During the stretching
process, the surface layer (outer layer) of the formed microfibers
was cooled down rapidly by air; however, the temperature of the inner
layer still kept at a high level. Thus, different deformabilities
between the outer and inner layers of microfibers would lead to continuous
melt fracture phenomenon and form the axially arranged nanowrinkles
in Figure 1d. The final
morphology of nanowrinkles was also significantly influenced by the
nonuniform shrinkage and creep after fracture of microfibers or detaching
from net wires. In this way, superhydrophobic surfaces with biomimetic
hierarchical roughness were finally obtained. The whole hot embossing
process can be done within 20 s, representing a relatively high efficiency
for the preparation of superhydrophobic surfaces.

Although many
researchers had reported their methods for the preparation
of biomimetic nanowrinkles and hierarchical roughness, the method
we proposed in this paper was undoubtedly one of the most efficient
and affordable ones. All our method required was a piece of commercialized
screen mesh, polymer substrates, and suitable temperature and pressure
conditions. No chemical treatment and expensive equipment were needed.

2.2 Influence of Different Parameters on Surface
Morphology and Hydrophobic Performance
Different parameters,
especially mesh number, embossing temperature, and pressure, had significant
impacts on the surface morphology and hydrophobic performance of final
products. In this section, their influences will be investigated and
discussed systematically to find out the optimal processing parameters.
Furthermore, the relationship between surface morphology and hydrophobic
performance will also be explored.

Figure 2 shows the influence of templates (stainless
steel meshes with different mesh numbers) on surface morphology and
hydrophobic performance of the as-prepared samples. In this figure,
(a)–(c) represent the characterization results of water contact
angle and morphologies on micro- and nanoscales, while 1–6
denote the variation of mesh numbers from 300 to 1500. Therefore, Figure 2a1 here represents
the water contact angle of the as-prepared sample using stainless
steel mesh with a mesh number of 300 as template. Similarly, the SEM
image named Figure 2b2 represented the sample morphology on microscale (microplatforms
and microfibers) using stainless steel mesh with a mesh number of
400 as template, and Figure 2c3 represents the sample morphology on nanoscale (regularly
arranged nanowrinkles on microfibers) using stainless steel mesh with
a mesh number of 500 as template. The rest of the pictures can be
named and explained in the same manner.

Figure 2 (a) Water contact angles
and morphologies on (b) microscale and
(c) nanoscale of the as-prepared samples using stainless steel meshes
with different mesh numbers as templates. (d) Relationship between
mesh number and hydrophobic performance of the as-prepared samples.
The scale bars in the insets of (b) and (c) are 200 and 1 μm,
respectively.

The embossing temperature
and pressure for all of the as-prepared
samples presented in Figure 2 were 94 °C and 6 MPa, respectively. According to the
measurement results, the contact angle of untreated PE/EVA composite
substrates was ∼93°, whereas that of the as-prepared samples
had been enlarged in different degrees (as shown in Figure 2d). The contact angle of the
as-prepared sample using stainless steel mesh with a mesh number of
300 as templates was 148°. This contact angle would increase
with increasing mesh number and reach a maximum of 154° when
the mesh number was 500. After that, further increase of mesh number
will lead to opposite effects and sharply reduce the contact angle
to around 109° (mesh number = 1500). The increase of contact
angle in the first stage was attributed to the size reduction of microstructures
on PE/EVA substrate, which was determined by the decreasing mesh size
with larger mesh numbers. Based on the Wenzel–Cassie model,
the increase of surface roughness was beneficial to enhance the hydrophobic
characteristic of the as-prepared samples, while higher surface roughness
can raise the proportion of air phase in solid–liquid–air
interface. Larger mesh number would lead to higher surface roughness
during the hot embossing process (as shown in Figure 2b1–b3) before the mesh number reached
500. Higher surface roughness would keep more air bubbles (on both
micro- and nanoscales) when water droplets dropped onto polymer surfaces.
The wetting of areas under air bubbles, especially the wetting of
bubbles between each nanowrinkle, was extremely difficult owing to
the effect of surface tension. Further, the dense air bubbles within
hierarchical structures would form a layer of air cushion between
water droplet and polymer surface, which finally created a polymeric
superhydrophobic surface with durable performance. In Figure 2b3, the most compact microfiber
structure was obtained. Further, oriented arranged nanowrinkle structures
could be observed on the surface of microfibers in each sample at
much higher magnification (30 000×). Compact nanowrinkles
with higher amplitudes were available when the mesh numbers were 400
and 500 (as shown in Figure 2c2,2c3, respectively). The combination
of compact microfibers and convex nanowrinkles on them ultimately
led to superior hydrophobicity of the as-prepared sample in Figure 2a2,a3 (150 and 154°,
respectively). Then, in the second stage, further increase of the
mesh number would lead to decline of contact angle. In most cases,
when the mesh number was higher than 500, the whole stainless steel
mesh would be composed by several layers (with lower mesh number)
to reduce the relative size of the aperture. The overlap between different
layers would increase the entering difficulty of melting polymer and
show negative effects on the formation of hierarchical roughness.
As shown in Figure 2b4–b6, the size of microstructures on PE/EVA substrates did
not decrease but became more messy and irregular with the increase
of mesh number above 500. The amplitude and compactness of nanowrinkles
in Figure 2c4–c6
also presented obvious downtrends.

Furthermore, the water adhesion
of the surface with a contact angle
of 154° was investigated by droplet rolling test. A 10 μL
water droplet was suspended from a microsyringe in air. Figure 3 shows that the water droplet
readily rolled on the as-prepared surface tilted ∼1°,
which indicated that the water sliding angle was extremely low. Thus,
comprehensive analysis of the results of water contact angle, sliding
angle, and SEM image was conducted, and the optimal mesh number of
the template used for the preparation of superhydrophobic surfaces
with biomimetic hierarchical roughness should be around 500.

Figure 3 Water droplet
rolling on the as-prepared PE surface tilted ∼1°.

After confirming the optimal mesh
number for templates, further
investigation on the influence of embossing temperature on surface
morphology and hydrophobic performance was carried out. The mesh number
of template and pressure for all of the as-prepared samples presented
in Figure 4 were 500
and 6 MPa, respectively. When the embossing temperature was just reached
or lower than 92 °C, rare microfibers can be found after embossing
(as shown in Figure 4b1,b2) according to the poor deformability. Similarly, the formation
of nanowrinkles was also restricted by the limited deformability,
which led to irregular arrangement and low amplitude of nanowrinkles
(Figure 4c1,c2). As
mentioned above, the biomimetic hierarchical roughness was composed
of microplatforms, microfibers, and nanowrinkles, and undesirable
combinations of the micro- and nanostructures eventually led to poor
hydrophobicity (116 and 120° in Figure 4a1,a2, respectively). After the embossing
temperature rose up to around or above Tm of EVA, normally formed microplatforms, dense microfibers (Figure 4b3,b4) with a length
of ∼100 μm and compact convex nanowrinkles (Figure 4c3,c4) with relatively
high amplitude (ca. 100–150 nm) together constituted the perfect
hierarchical roughness and sharply rose the water contact angle up
to more than 150°. The contact angles of the as-prepared samples
with embossing temperatures of 94 and 96 °C were 154 and 153°
(Figure 4a3,a4), respectively.
That is, 94–96 °C can be recognized as the optimal range
of embossing temperature for the preparation of superhydrophobic surfaces
with hierarchical roughness. However, the optimal range of embossing
temperature was so narrow that further increase would lead to undesirable
morphologies (Figure 4b5,c5) and sharp reduction of contact angle (122° in Figure 4a5).

and morphologies on (b) microscale and
(c) nanoscale of samples prepared by isothermal hot embossing with
different embossing temperatures. (d) Relationship between embossing
temperature and hydrophobic performance of the as-prepared samples.
The scale bars in the insets of (b) and (c) are 200 and 1 μm,
respectively.

A similar research process
was also applied to find the optimal
pressure. Figure 5 presents
the results of water contact angle and morphology of the as-prepared
samples. The mesh number of template and embossing temperature applied
in the hot embossing process were 500 and 94 °C, respectively.
As shown in Figure 5d, the optimal pressure was around 6 MPa and the water contact angle
can be higher than 150° (Figure 5a2). The most important influence factor in this experimental
group was the forming results of microplatforms and microfibers on
account of the same temperature condition and the consequent same
forming ability of nanowrinkles. Thus, although the forming results
of nanowrinkles in Figure 5c1 were good enough, the hydrophobicity of the corresponding
samples was not that good (129° in Figure 5a1) due to the sparse microfibers (as shown
in Figure 5b1) and
the consequent imperfect hierarchical roughness. This could also explain
the undesirable hydrophobicity of the as-prepared samples fabricated
with 10 MPa pressure (132° in Figure 5a4). Majority of the microfibers would be
snapped during the demolding step as too much melting polymer went
through the template under such high pressure and formed a “mushroom-like”
structure during the embossing step.

different pressures. (d) Relationship between pressure and hydrophobic
performance of the as-prepared samples. The scale bars in the insets
of (b) and (c) are 100 and 1 μm, respectively.

Overall, the optimal processing parameters for
the preparation
of PE/EVA superhydrophobic surfaces with biomimetic hierarchical roughness
should be 94 °C and 6 MPa. The best templates were stainless
steel meshes with a mesh number of 500. In this way, perfect biomimetic
hierarchical roughness can be obtained, and the whole preparation
cycle of isothermal hot embossing can be as short as 20 s. With the
advantages of low equipment requirement and easy operation of isothermal
hot embossing, the preparation method proposed in this paper was doubtlessly
a simple and affordable way to achieve polymeric superhydrophobic
surfaces. Furthermore, it also showed greater superiority in large-area
and large-scale production due to its advantages of low cost, high
efficiency, and high reliability.

Besides hydrophobicity, the
lipophobicities of the as-prepared
samples before and after hot embossing were also measured and compared
to demonstrate the promoting effect of biomimetic hierarchical roughness
on wettability. Since the surface tension of oil was lower than that
of water, the promotion of lipophobicity was much harder than that
of hydrophobicity. As shown in Figure 6a,b, water contact angles of the as-prepared samples
before and after isothermal hot embossing under the aforementioned
optimal parameters were 93 and 154°, respectively. However, the
oil contact angles of the same samples were 26 and 97°, respectively
(Figure 6c,d). Although
the promotion of oil contact angles from 26 to 97° was an obvious
one, it still cannot meet the usage requirements in most situations
(e.g., self-cleaning and antioil). A much higher oil contact angle
of 140° can be obtained after modifying the PE/EVA surface with
fluorosilane (as shown in the inset of Figure 6d). The hierarchical roughness and low surface
energy of modified samples had worked together to create the significant
promotion of oil contact angle from 26 to 140°.

hydrophobicity and (c, d) lipophobicity of
PE samples before and after hot embossing. The inset presents the
lipophobicity of PE sample after hot embossing and fluorosilane modification.

3 Conclusions
In this paper, stainless steel meshes were applied as templates
for the preparation of polymeric superhydrophobic surfaces with biomimetic
hierarchical roughness via isothermal hot embossing. Herein, the hierarchical
roughness was composed of microplatforms, microfibers, and oriented
arrayed nanowrinkles formed during the demolding step. After parameter
optimization, the optimal processing parameters for PE/EVA samples
prepared by the hot embossing method were decided to be 94 °C
and 6 MPa, while the best templates were stainless steel meshes with
a mesh number of 500. A water contact angle of 154° and an oil
contact angle of 97° can be achieved under the aforementioned
optimal parameters. After further modifying using fluorosilane, the
oil contact angle would increase to 140° under the cooperation
of hierarchical roughness and low surface energy. In addition, water
droplets were found to roll readily on the as-prepared surface tilted
∼1°, which indicated an extremely low water sliding angle.
It was worth mentioning that the whole hot embossing process can be
finished within 20 s, and this method was also suitable for extra
large (>feet2) samples. By changing the size of polymer
substrate, mesh template, and hot embossing equipment, superhydrophobic
surfaces with biomimetic hierarchical roughness can be even larger.
Therefore, the method proposed in this paper was a simple and affordable
way for the mass industrial production of polymeric superhydrophobic
surfaces.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
and Experimental Devices
Stainless steel meshes with different
mesh numbers (Shanghai Yixiang
stainless steel screen mesh manufacturer, China) were used as templates
in the preparing process. Polyethylene/ethylene vinyl acetate (PE/EVA)
copolymer composite substrates with a thickness of 0.3 mm were purchased
from Dongguan Ruihang Plastic Materials Co., Ltd. The specific components
of this composite substrate were evaluated by differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC).53 As shown in Figure 7, three absorption
peaks at 95.04, 108.25, and 127.08 °C can be observed on the
DSC melting curve, representing EVA, low-density polyethylene, and
metallocene polyethylene, respectively. Transparent polycarbonate
(PC) substrates with a thickness of 0.25 mm were provided by Dongguan
Lingmei New Materials Co., Ltd. for use as supports during hot embossing.
A homemade hot embossing device, which can provide precisely controlled
embossing temperature and pressure, was utilized to perform the plate-to-plate
isothermal hot embossing for the preparation of superhydrophobic surfaces.
The plate-to-plate isothermal hot embossing process was ideal for
large-scale production of functional microdevice with pretty high
efficiency down to 20 s. The most important feature of isothermal
hot embossing was its constant and relatively low mold temperature
during the whole embossing process.

4.2 Preparation
of Polymeric Superhydrophobic
Surfaces
First, PE/EVA substrates and stainless steel meshes
were cut into appropriate size (90 × 60 mm2) and then
wiped clean using absolute alcohol for further applications. Here,
the product size can be even larger as the only limitation was the
size of the experimental platform. Second, a small amount of demolding
agent was sprayed on the surfaces of PE/EVA substrate and stainless
steel mesh for easier demolding. Third, the PE/EVA substrate (at the
bottom) and stainless steel mesh (on top) were placed together in
the embossing area of the experimental device. Two pieces of PC substrates
were also placed on their both sides as supports. Precisely controlled
temperature and pressure were set for isothermal hot embossing. The
“isothermal” indicated the constant embossing temperature
in the whole process, which will significantly reduce the cycle time
from more than 10 min to ∼20 s.51,52,54,55 After embossed for
a certain holding time and demolding process (quickly peeling off
from the stainless steel mesh in the case of incomplete cooling),
PE/EVA substrate with superhydrophobic performance was finally obtained.
And it is worth mentioning that the hot embossing method for the preparation
of micro/nanostructures and hierarchical structures can be applied
for other thermoplastic polymers, such as PC, polymethyl methacrylate,
polypropylene, and so on. The structure type is also designable depending
on different materials, situations, and applications.21,54,56

4.3 Characterization
The morphology of
fabricated surface with hierarchical roughness was observed by a field
emission scanning electron microscope (S-4700, Hitachi, Japan).57,58 The contact angles of water droplets of the as-prepared samples
were measured by a drop shape analyzer (DSA100, KRÜSS, Germany).
Soybean oil was used for measuring and comparing oil contact angles.
