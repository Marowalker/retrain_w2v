We report the path
for a possible fabrication of an array of nanogrooves, by electro-hydrodynamic
instability-mediated patterning of a thin polymer film using a patterned
stamp with much larger features. Using a predictive computational
model based on finite element method, we find the route to control
the coalescence of initial instabilities that arise with the onset
of spatially varying DC electric field generated through topographical
patterns in the top electrode. These quasi-steady structures are shown
to evolve with the electrostatic and geometric nature of the two-electrode
system and are of a stable intermediate during the process of feature
replication, under each electrode feature. We identify conditions
to obtain nanogrooves for a range of operating conditions. Such simulations
are likely to guide experiments, where simultaneous optimization of
multiple parameters to fabricate features with lateral dimension smaller
than that of the electrode patterns is challenging.

1 Introduction
In
a time when miniaturization is the need of hour, rapid and effective
techniques of synthesizing nano/mesoscale patterns are in high demand.
These structures are used in various fields of nanobiotechnology,1 lab-on-a-chip devices,2 microfluidics,3 hydrophobic and self-cleaning
surfaces,4 bulk heterojunction solar cells,5,6 organic light-emitting diodes,7 and so
on. Consequently, researchers have turned to various novel patterning
techniques to engineer surfaces and structures that are not easily
manufactured by conventional top-down lithographic methods.8 However, lithographic techniques are generically
expensive, meticulous, and often has limitations either in terms of
throughput or resolution.9 Recently, spontaneous
instability-mediated morphological evolution in ultrathin films, particularly
in conjugation with lateral confinement, is being considered as a
viable nonlithographic mesofabrication technique for soft materials.10 Such instabilities result because of applications
of thermally excited capillary waves engendered by van der Waals force-mediated
disjoining pressure and are thus limited only in ultrathin films (h ≤ 100 nm). On the other hand, much thicker films
can be destabilized by the action of an externally applied field,
such as an electric field or a thermal gradient. Although the stability
and dynamics of fluid–fluid interfaces subject to an externally
applied electric field was studied first by Swan11 in 1897, it was only around the year 2000 when Schäffer
et al.12 pioneered the concept of electric-field-mediated
instability for patterning thin polymer films, which has been termed
as electro hydrodynamic (EHD) lithography. EHD instability-mediated
patterning, which uses a capacitor system with thin/ultrathin films
of polymers, provides excellent ability of morphology control, in
comparison with direct embossing-based techniques.8,13−15 Apart from thin films of homopolymers, films of various
functional materials such as conductive polymers, block copolymers,
inorganic thin films, and so on have been patterned by EHD instability.16−19 Fabrication of high aspect ratio structures was accomplished by
Lv et al.20,21 in their recent studies.

The destabilizing
effect of electric forces on the free surface of a thin film has been
well-explored by numerous researchers.22−30 A significant advantage of using EHD is the accomplishment of control
over the length scale of the surface patterns.31−33 However, required
external source of energy, breakdown of dielectric polymer at high
voltages, and involvement of several influencing parameters are challenges
to this technology.8,34 Schäffer et al.12 found that careful control of EHD instabilities
can be exploited to generate well-defined pillars because they could
replicate a patterned top electrode on a sub-micrometer lateral dimension.
Various experimental observations with a flat top and bottom electrode
show the evolution of isotropic structures with a dominant wavelength
that corresponds to the fastest growing mode of instability, which
governs the spatiotemporal evolution and the final morphology of the
features. Theoretically, an expression for the fastest growing mode
of instability can be obtained from a linear stability analysis,12,35,36 the expression for which is 1  where γ, ψ, ϵ0, ϵp, and Ep are interfacial
tension, applied voltage, permittivity of free space, relative permittivity
of polymer film to the bounding fluid, and electric field intensity
at the polymer–air interface, respectively.

It can be
seen that the characteristic wavelength is a function of both the
geometry and electrostatic parameters of the system, which is an interplay
between the electrostatic and surface tension forces. Additional control
and ordering of the instability features including possible miniaturization
can be achieved by using a topographically patterned top electrode,
where patterns are seen to replicate below each protrusion of the
patterned top electrode. Under a patterned top electrode, the gradient
in electric field strength because of the presence of heterogeneity
strongly influences the evolution process, and consequently the pattern
periodicity (Lp) and geometry of the top
electrode determine the final morphology, in addition to initial film
thickness (h0), gap spacing (d), and field strength. Several theoretical and numerical studies
have been carried out to mathematically elucidate the patterning process
as well as to identify the conditions for the formation of ordered
patterns on single and/or multilayer thin films.2,34,37−51 With a nonlinear 3D model for polymer/substrate morphology, Verma
et al.52 identified the ideal conditions
necessary for pattern replication and indicated that the number density
of the replicated patterns can be altered by varying the applied voltage
or tuning the mean film thickness, periodicity, and depth of grooves
on the top electrode. Moreover, they predicted the possible formation
of secondary structures between two parallel ridges, which was also
experimentally substantiated by Harkema.53 The formation of secondary structures has been related to the depletion
of liquid during the formation of primary continuous ridges.54 Atta et al.55 showed
the self-assembly of ordered nanopillars on the introduction of marginal
chemical heterogeneity on the surface of electrode assembly. Electrically
heterogeneous patterned electrodes have also been used for the fabrication
of re-entrant structures which are beyond the fabrication capability
of imprint lithography.56 Recently, researchers
have also investigated EHD patterning of prepatterned surfaces in
search of novel and miniaturized structures.57,58

On the basis of a careful review of published literature,
we identify that there is no clear study that elaborates the morphological
evolution of stable intermediate structures, particularly capturing
the transition of single to multiple pillars under a solitary protrusion
of the top electrode. In this study, we report an intermediate structure
in case of an insufficient peak splitting during the transitional
regime from single to multiple pillars under one protrusion that results
in a toothlike cavity, termed as nanogroove. We identify the relation
between width of the protrusion (w) and λc, as the effect of Lp on λc is already well-perceived. A numerical model based on finite
element method is employed to investigate the influence of filling
factor, initial film thickness, applied voltage, protrusion height,
and electrode spacing on the obtained quasi-steady-state patterns.
These results are of paramount importance in designing, optimization,
and fabrication of ordered nanostructures, which particularly will
be able to guide toward the desired morphology avoiding undesired
coalescence of patterns. Fabrication of such nanoscale structures
using a stamp with a much larger lateral dimension is the key novelty
of this work, particularly from the standpoint of nanofabrication.

2 Mathematical Formulation
2.1 System Description
Figure 1 shows the
schematic of the EHD assembly, where the bottom electrode is coated
with ultrathin polymeric film of initial thickness of h0, and the confined space above the film is occupied by
air as the bounding fluid. The electrode assembly with variable d(x) because of protrusion at the top electrode
results in heterogeneous electric field, where as the flat plate assembly
produces homogeneous electric field in lateral direction. Along with
gap spacing (d), other parameters that define a heterogeneous
system, such as electrode width (w), pattern height
(p), and stamp periodicity (Lp) are depicted in Figure 1b. Figure 1c represents a 3D structure of the physical system with columnlike
top-electrode protrusions. The interfacial perturbation with the onset
of electric field by applying a DC potential of ψ at the top
electrode and keeping the bottom as ground results in film thickness h(x,t) as a function in
space and time domain. This thin-film system is considered to be isothermal,
incompressible (ρ2 = 1000 kg/m3), Newtonian
(μ = 1 Pa·s), and perfect dielectric (ϵ2 = 2.5) with air–polymer interfacial tension (γ) as
0.038 N/m.

the geometrical parameters and top electrode as (a) flat plate and
(b) patterned stamp with square protrusions, and (c) 3D representation
of patterned stamp with column protrusions electrode assembly.

2.2 Governing
Equations and Boundary Conditions
2.2.1 Fluid
Flow
The governing equation for this incompressible Newtonian
fluid is defined by the set of Navier–Stokes (eq 2) and continuity equation (eq 3), coupled with Maxwell
equations to account for the presence of external electric field. 2   3  where fi represents the body forces and the
subscript denotes the phases (1 for air and 2 for polymeric film).

2.2.2 Boundary Conditions
At the upper and
lower electrodes, no slip boundary conditions are applied. 4  

At the interface, continuity of velocity
is assumed. 5  

The interfacial velocity
(ω) under an infinitesimal perturbation is related to the film
thickness by the following kinematic boundary condition.59 6  

To simplify and solve the governing equations
for this system, we assume (a) two fluids as immiscible with no interphase
mass transfer across the interface, (b) the film is sufficiently thick
that continuum assumption is valid but thin enough so that the effect
of gravity can be neglected, and (c) inertial effects will be negligible
because of ultrathin film condition. These simplifications along with
the consideration of long-wave approximation60 give rise to the temporal evolution of thin-film height that can
be described by the following expression61 7  where 8  

In eq 8, ψ0, ψel, and ψLW represent atmospheric pressure, electrostatic pressure,
and disjoining pressure because of Lifshitz–van der Walls (LW)
interactions, respectively. Moreover, ψel and ψLW can be estimated from the following equations36,55 9   10  where AL is the
effective Hamaker constant for interactions between the free surface
of the film and lower solid surface through the fluid film. In our
case, ψLW can be neglected because of the presence
of dominant electrostatic force. Detailed derivation of the aforementioned
equations can be found elsewhere.35,38,52,55

3 Computational Model
As shown in Figure 2, a 2D model in COMSOL Multiphysics62 has been developed to realize the evolution
of the structure because of the electrostatic force and surface tension
at the interface of the liquid polymer. The 2D computational model
exemplifies columnlike physical system, as shown in Figure 1c in three dimensions. DC potential
is implemented between the bottom (boundary 2) and the top electrode
(boundaries 5–21). Other boundary conditions for the solution
are (a) no slip at boundaries 2, and 5–21; (b) symmetry on
boundaries 1, 3, 22, and 23; (c) initial fluid interface at boundary
4; and (d) pressure point constraint at points a and b, which are
the two ends of the air film interface. The polymer–air interface
is tracked by using conservative form of the level-set method (eq 11),62 where a phase is characterized by a level-set function
φls, which is 0 in case of air and is 1 for polymer.
Consequently, the interface is captured by contour of level function
φls = 0.5. 11  where γls determines
the amount of reinitialization of the level-set function and the parameter
ϵls specifies thickness of the interface. A suitable
value for γls (0.1) is the maximum magnitude of the
velocity field in the model, and ϵls = hc/2, where hc is the maximum
element size across the interface.

Figure 2 Schematic of computational domain, boundaries,
and points used in this work.

Furthermore, the assumptions of film and air as perfect dielectric
media with zero net charge in the bulk results in equations governing
the force exerted on the interface. This is resolved using the following
Laplace equation. 12  where ϵ0 is the dielectric permittivity of the vacuum, ψ is
the voltage, and ϵr is the dielectric constant of
the air or polymer, defined as ϵr = 1 + 1.5φls. The level-set function smooths the material property such
as density, viscosity, and dielectric constant jump across the interface
as follows: 13   14   15  

The body-force term in eq 2 is implemented as follows 16  

Two components of the body-force term fi in eq 16 are volumetric forces because of surface tension, Fst = pelδn⃗, and electrostatic force, Fel = pelδ, where the electrostatic
pressure pel = γκδn⃗, γ is the surface tension, δ is the
numerical interpretation of Dirac delta function that is concentrated
at the interface and in level set method, and δ = 6|φls(1 – φls)||∇φls| provides a smooth transition along the interface. n⃗ is the unit outward normal to the interface, and κ is surface
curvature estimated as: κ = ∇·n⃗.

4 Results and Discussion
In case of a homogeneous
electric field, EHD-induced patterning is analytically described by
characteristic wavelength derived from linear stability analysis of
the system. In a system of two flat electrodes (Figure 1a), the gradient of electric pressure at
extreme corners is responsible for the initial perturbation of interface,
which consequently propagates creating a pressure gradient along the
interface. This mechanism is essentially responsible for the formation
of nanopatterns in case of a flat electrode assembly. However, in
case of a topographically patterned top electrode (Figure 1b), difference in electrical
pressure is locally generated over the interface at the level of each
feature on the top electrode, and this variation subsequently triggers
a flow of polymeric fluid, which manifests in rising morphologies
below the protrusions of the top electrode. Fluid drains from the
domain between two protrusions toward the region directly under these
features. Initially, electric pressure gradient present over the interface
and beneath the corner of protrusion is responsible for driving this
fluid, which we denote as inflow gradient. An interesting but intuitive
morphology is observed when the width of the protrusion is large.
Similar to flat plate assembly, a secondary instability is detected,
which rises because of the ripple created by the gradient of electrical
pressure. For complex systems with patterned top electrode, there
is no single characteristic λ owing to varying gap spacing.
In such systems, on moving from bottom electrode to the top, we find
two gap spacings, d1 and d2, which are minimum and maximum separation distances
between top and bottom electrodes. Characteristic wavelength of instability
corresponding to d1 and d2 are denoted by λd1 and λd2, respectively.
From a number of simulations, it is evident that secondary instability
is first observed in between λd1 and λd2, where
two separate pillars form under one protrusion, and this leads to
a novel and intriguing morphological structure having nanogrooves
on the top. In such cases, ripple created by the inflow gradient tries
to rip the rising pillar, although it is not strong enough to snap
completely. These structures attain quasi-steady state as confirmed
by the simulations in our study. In an attempt to estimate this morphological
transition and its relation to influencing parameters, we have identified
five different electrode widths that are on the basis of characteristic λ
(eq 1), as: λd1, λ(d1+davg)/2, λdavg, λ(davg+d2)/2, and λd2 for electrode spacing (d) as d1, (d1 + davg)/2, davg, (davg + d2)/2, and d2, respectively, where davg = (d1 + d2)/2.

4.1 Mechanism of Structural
Evolution
Understanding of structural evolution in case of
transitional structure not only provides better understanding about
the evolution process but also reveal the key parameters that control
the transition from single to multiple pillars under one protrusion.
Although the flow of polymer is a function of instantaneous electric
field distribution, it can be shown that initial electric field distribution
can be a fair metric for predicting the final morphology, and the
subsequent dynamics. Maximum (Emax) and
minimum (Emin) field strengths across
the interface are just beneath the center of protrusion and the groove
of top electrode, respectively (Figure 3). The inflow gradient drives the fluid from outside
toward protrusion and is proportional to (Emax2 – Emin2) across the interface.

Figure 3 Initial electric field intensity distribution
on a 30 nm polymeric film under protruded top electrode having w = λd1 = 214
nm, and p = 20 nm for 70 V, d2 = 100 nm, and Lp = 350 nm.

Figure 4 demonstrates the progressive evolution of
a 30 nm liquid film under the applied DC potential of 70 V using a
214 nm (λd1) × 20
nm protruded top electrode and gap spacing (d2) of 100 nm. Instabilities can be seen rising from the edges
because of the presence of the inflow gradient, which pulls polymeric
fluid from outside of the protrusion inward at the edges, as shown
in Figure 4b. Thereafter,
these instabilities derive the polymeric fluid toward the center of
the protrusion in the horizontal direction and vertically upward because
of the electrostatic pressure (Figure 4c). Although inflow gradient drives the flow toward
the spatial region beneath the protrusions, incoming fluid does not
get equally distributed in the whole region creating two bulges, similar
to what is observed under a flat top electrode as is evident from Figure 4c. This growth attains
a quasi-steady state, when the rising front of a growing pillar touches
the top electrode (Figure 4d) and subsequently remains unaltered (Figure 4e).

Figure 4 Temporal evolution of a 30 nm polymeric film
under protruded top electrode having w = λd1 = 214 nm, and p = 20 nm for ψ = 70 V, d2 = 100
nm, and Lp = 350 nm at (a) 0, (b) 2, (c)
6, (d) 15, and (e) 100 μs.

4.2 Influence of Filling Factor
The filling
factor, defined as the ratio of w/Lp, is a key parameter in systems with topographically
patterned top electrode that limits the patterning range. Its effect
on the final morphology can be observed by either changing w or Lp at a time. Figure 5 shows the variation
in the final morphology when w is varied from λd1 to λd2 keeping ψ = 70 V, h0 = 30 nm, Lp = 350 nm, d2 = 100 nm, and p = 20 nm.
It is evident from Figure 5a that single pillar is observed when the width of top electrode
is 210 nm (<λd1).
Further increase in the width of protrusion, a pillar with nanogroove
is observed at w = λd1 = 214 nm (Figure 5b), and for w = λ(d1+davg)/2,
the grooves become deeper that touch the ground electrode (Figure 5c). Two distinct
pillars are observed at λdavg (Figure 5d),
and further increase in w results in even more distant
pillars under one protrusion at w = λd2 (Figure 5f). This development is consistent with our observations
of initial electric-field distribution (Figure 6), where it is apparent that the gradient
of electric field is maximum at the corners of the protrusion and
vanishes on approaching the center. The region of low-electric-field
gradient increases with an increase in protrusion width (w). Therefore, the final morphology is seen to shift from a high degree
of coalescence (single pillar) to partial coalescence (nanogroove
structures) to no coalescence (multiple pillars) (Figure 5). The parameters are selected
in such a way that periodicity value is sufficiently larger than the
electrode width. For comparable values, one may encounter two major
issues. First, fabricating within tens of nanometers with accuracy
is a problem, and second, the system will start behaving similar to
a flat plate because of very small distance between two protrusions.
The gap region with low electric field strength will be negligible
compared to area under protrusion, and results similar to a flat plate
might be obtained. Figure 7 demonstrates the filling factor variation by changing the
pattern periodicity Lp from 250 to 400
nm, keeping voltage at 70 V, film thickness h0 = 30 nm, electrode spacing (d2) = 100 nm, and pattern height (p) at 20 nm. At
a fixed electrode width w, the inflow gradient increases
with Lp and the system shows higher degree
of deviation from a flat electrode system (Figure 8). It can be understood that at higher Lp values, formation of multiple pillar is more
favorable as compared to single pillar because of enhanced flow of
material resulting from high inflow gradient, which alleviates the
nanogroove formation. Therefore, it is worth noting that we show fabrication
of structures that are much smaller than features on the stamp, and
we circumvent the issue of nanoscale patterning by a mesopatterned
stamp, which otherwise involves more complex and costly fabrication
procedure.

and (d) Lp = 400 nm.

electrode (w = 225 nm, p = 20 nm)
at 70 V and d2 = 100 nm.

4.3 Influence of Initial Film
Thickness
It can be realized from linear stability analysis
(eq 1) that the values
of characteristic wavelength decrease with increasing h0. To elucidate the sole effect of film thickness, here,
we have shown the sole effect of film thickness by (a) keeping all
other parameters fixed including the filling factor (w/Lp = 0.6) and electrode width as w = λ(d1+davg)/2 for all cases (Figure 9) and by (b) maintaining w constant (225 nm) along with all of the other parameters
fixed for all h0 (Figure 10). For the first case, Figure 9 illustrates quasi-steady-state
structures with electrode width corresponding to λ(d1+davg)/2.
Separate pillars are observed in case of thinner film (Figure 9a). With increasing h0, tendency of nanogroove structures and single
pillar increases. The nanogroove structure is observed for h0 = 40 nm (Figure 9d). This can be attributed to the fact that
on increasing film thickness, interface comes closer to top electrode
and enhanced distributed electrical pressure acts on the same. Figure 10 describes the
second case, where morphologies are obtained on the variation of film
thickness keeping the electrode width constant (w = 225 nm) along with all of the other system parameters. We observed
a single pillar under the protrusion in case of h0 = 25 nm (Figure 10a), which is in line with our expectation as w = 225 nm < λd1 = 229 nm (Figure 11). In case of h0 = 30 nm (Figure 10b), the nanogroove
structure is observed as λd1 = 213 nm < w = 225 nm < λ(d1+davg)/2 = 240 nm. Similarly, we noticed separated polymeric pillars when h0 = 35 nm (Figure 10c) as λ(d1+davg)/2 = w = 225 nm. Thereafter, pillar separation increases in case of 40
nm thick polymeric film (Figure 10d) as w = 225 nm > λ(d1+davg)/2 = 208 nm. Figure 11 shows the characteristic λ defined for different film thicknesses
and summarizes the results obtained through identification of three
zones where single, nanogroove, and separate pillars are more likely
to be observed.

V under a protruded top electrode having w = λ(d1+davg)/2 nm, and p = 20 nm with d2 = 100 nm and filling factor = 0.6 for (a) h0 = 25 nm, (b) h0 = 30 nm, (c) h0 = 35 nm, and (d) h0 = 40 nm.

and (d) h0 = 40 nm.

for different electrode widths and initial film thicknesses.

4.4 Influence
of Electric Potential
Quasi-steady-state structures of 30
nm polymeric film at varying electric potential for a fixed Lp and h0 is shown
in Figure 12. At higher
potential, the inflow gradient increases and with increasing voltage,
the likelihood of formation of nanoscale groove increases. For example,
at 60 V, Lp = 350 and 30 nm initial film
thickness, nanogrooved structure is not observed, but it becomes prevalent
with increasing the electric potential to 70 V keeping the other parameter
fixed. It should be noted that there is an upper limit of applied
voltage for a particular system above which the dielectric breakdown
point of polymer has to be taken into account.

Figure 12 Quasi-steady-state structure
of a 30 nm polymeric film under a protruded top electrode having w = 225 nm and p = 20 nm with d2 = 100 nm and Lp = 350 nm
at (a) ψ = 60 V, (b) ψ = 65 V, (c) ψ = 70 V, (d)
ψ = 75 V, and (e) ψ = 80 V.

4.5 Influence of Protrusion Height and Electrode
Spacing
An increase in protrusion height (p) effectively reduces the gap between the top electrode and the interface,
which increases the perturbing force. Accordingly, the characteristic
wavelength values decrease while the ease of groove formation is enhanced.
In Figure 13a, the
formation of a single pillar is observed when the protrusion height
(p) is 10 nm with ψ = 70 V, w = 214 nm, d2 = 100 nm,
and Lp = 350 nm. By keeping all other
operating parameters fixed, we observed the nanogroove structures
when p was increased to 20 nm (Figure 13b). Two separate pillars are
detected at p = 30 and 40 nm (Figure 13c,d). On the contrary, with increasing electrode
spacing (d), exactly opposing behavior is found as
the electrode-film interface gap increases with increasing d2 and the formation of nanogrooved structures
becomes more difficult (Figure 14).

5 Conclusions
In this article, a 2D computational
model based on finite element method has been utilized to study the
thin film dynamics under the action of an external electric field
in the presence of a topographically patterned top electrode. It is
shown that by applying a heterogeneous electric field, nanogrooved
structures can be produced through controlled ripple formation at
the fluid–air interface. Under topographically patterned top
electrode having width corresponding to λc, spatiotemporal
variation of the morphological patterns beneath a single protrusion
is reported. Effect of filling factor, applied voltage, initial film
thickness, protrusion height, and electrode spacing on the formation
of structures are systematically characterized. The study is significant
in elucidating the sensitivity of several independent parameters such
as λc, Lp, h0, and ψ on EHD instability in a thin polymeric
film. Systematic investigation indicates λd1 < w < λ(d1+davg)/2 as
a first approximation for nanogroove structures, and this study can
further be used to optimize the process parameters for desired morphology.
It also suggests a recipe for miniaturization with desired nanostructures
under appropriate condition in the form of possible fabrication of
nanogrooves starting from a patterned stamp with a much wider lateral
dimension. Such miniaturization of feature dimension is not possible
in any of the direct embossing-based patterning techniques.
