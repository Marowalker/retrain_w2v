Verticillium
wilt is a plant vascular disease causing severe yield
and quality losses in many crops and is caused by the soil-borne plant
pathogenic fungus Verticillium dahliae. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of the cotton–V. dahliae interaction, a time-course phosphoproteomic
analysis of roots of susceptible and resistant cotton lines in response
to V. dahliae was performed. In total,
1716 unique phosphoproteins were identified in the susceptible (S)
and resistant (R) cotton lines. Of these, 359 phosphoproteins were
significantly different in R1 (1 day after V. dahliae inoculation) vs R0 (mock) group and 287 phosphoproteins in R2 (3
days after V. dahliae inoculation)
vs R0 group. Moreover, 263 proteins of V. dahliae-regulated phosphoproteins were significantly changed in S1 (1 day
after V. dahliae inoculation) vs S0
(mock) group and 197 proteins in S2 (3 days after V.
dahliae inoculation) vs S0 group. Thirty phosphoproteins
were significantly changed and common to the resistant and susceptible
cotton lines following inoculation with V. dahliae. Specifically, 92 phosphoproteins were shared in both in R1 vs R0
and R2 vs R0 but not in susceptible cotton lines. There were 38 common
phosphoproteins shared in both S1 vs S0 and S2 vs S0 but not in resistant
cotton lines. GO terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
pathway analyses displayed an abundance of known and novel phosphoproteins
related to plant–pathogen interactions, signal transduction,
and metabolic processes, which were correlated with resistance against
fungal infection. These data provide new perspectives and inspiration
for understanding molecular defense mechanisms of cotton roots against V. dahliae infection.

1 Introduction
Cotton
(Gossypium spp.) is one of the most important
economic crops in the world and is the main source of natural textile
fibers. The plant pathogenic fungus Verticillium dahliae Kleb. causes plant vascular diseases1 and often results in severe cotton yield reductions and losses.2,3 The pathogen can adhere to the root surface, and its hyphae penetrate
the roots and colonize the cortex. They then extend into the xylem
and form conidia.4 Meanwhile, the toxic,
cell-wall-degrading enzymes and elicitor-like substances are produced
by V. dahliae to suppress plant innate
immune responses.3 It has been found that
the tolerant and resistant plant genotypes are less sensitive to V. dahliae and activate defense responses to V. dahliae.(5−7) Although a number of studies report
on plant–V. dahliae interactions,
there remains limited knowledge about the molecular mechanism of plants
against V. dahliae.(5,8,9)

Post-translational modifications play
a key role in many cellular
processes and regulate protein activity, targeting, or interactions
with other proteins.10 The reversible phosphorylation
of proteins plays an important role in the regulation of almost all
life activities since it plays a vital role in intracellular signal
transduction11,12 and is involved in regulating
cell cycle progression, development, response, differentiation, transformation,
and metabolism.13 Protein kinases are involved
in the reversible process (phosphorylation/dephosphorylation), including
the transfer and removal of the phosphate groups, which are important
signaling mechanisms in eukaryotic cells.14−18 These mechanisms have been confirmed to play important
roles in response to a variety of abiotic and biotic stresses, including
cold stress, drought stress, salt stress, and pathogen infections.
Deciphering molecular mechanisms of defense in response to pathogen
stresses will improve our understanding of the processes in plants.19,20

In recent years, large-scale protein phosphorylation analyses
have
been performed on many plant species with technological advancements
in peptide enrichment, high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS), and
associated bioinformatics.20−24 In maize, a total of 4361 phosphorylated protein sites were quantified,
of which were significantly regulated upon drought stress. In addition,
it is as major functional groups that signaling and transport proteins
were identified in the post-translation modifications. Similarly,
most of the identified proteins in maize roots grown under high and
low iron conditions were classified as signaling proteins. Of these,
BAK1, PTI1, AIR12, and 14-3-3 proteins were significantly changed
by Fe stress, and PTI1 levels were increased in response to high and
low iron stresses.25 Protein phosphorylation
and dephosphorylation are involved in multiple signaling pathways.
In plants, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation also play a pivotal
role in ABA signaling pathway and mediate the regulation of stomatal
movement in response to ABA.26 The phosphorylation
of CIPK is an important factor in Ca2+-mediated signaling,
which plays a key role in signal transduction.27

To investigate the molecular mechanisms of the cotton–V. dahliae interaction, we analyzed changes of phosphoprotein
profiles in the roots of susceptible and resistant cotton genotypes
inoculated with V. dahliae using liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We also performed
proteome-wide label-free quantification using MaxQuant software with
intensity-based absolute quantification (iBAQ). This study provides
valuable data and novel insights for further investigations into molecular
events involved in cotton defense responses to V. dahliae.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Identification
and Differential Analysis of
Cotton Roots in Response to V. dahliae Infection
The strategy of phosphoproteomic profiling from
cotton roots inoculated with V. dahliae is shown in Figure S1. A total of 5405
unique phosphosites and 2522 unique phosphopeptides from 1716 unique
proteins were identified from the roots of NIL-R and NIL-S (Table S1). Of the 5405 phosphorylation sites,
4702 (87.00%) were from phosphoserine, 619 (11.45%) were from phosphothreonine,
and 84 (1.55%) were from phosphotyrosine. Of the 2522 unique phosphopeptides,
the singly phosphorylated were very few, only 1.07%, whereas most
were doubly or multiply phosphorylated (46.75 and 52.18%, respectively)
(Table 1).

Table 1 Number of Phosphorylation Sites, Phosphopeptides,
and Phosphoproteins Identified in This Study
listing	number	
phosphorylation sites	5358	
phosphorylation sites (tyr/hr/ser)	84:614:4660	
phosphopeptides	2522	
phosphopeptides (single/double/multiple)	27:1179:1316	
phosphoproteins	1716	
Among those 1716 phosphoproteins,
differences between the mock
and inoculated samples were assessed with a t-test.
A threshold p value of <0.05 and the absolute
fold change value of phosphorylation of >2 were used as criteria
to
identify phosphoproteins with a differential abundance. For a total of 639 phosphoproteins,
differences between the mock and inoculated samples in cotton roots
were assessed. Of these, there were 359 proteins with significant
phosphorylation at 1 dpi (R1) compared with the mock (R0) for the
resistant line NIL-R [258 proteins were increased and 101 proteins
were decreased (Table S2 and Figure 1A)]. Three days after inoculations
(R2), there were 287 proteins with significant phosphoprotein changes
compared to the mock (R0) from NIL-R [209 proteins were increased
and 78 proteins were decreased (Table S2 and Figure 1B)].
In the susceptible line NIL-S, there were 263 proteins with significant
phosphorylation changes at 1 dpi (S1) compared to the mock (S0) from
NIL-S; 144 proteins were increased and 119 proteins were decreased
(Table S2 and Figure 1C). Three days after inoculation (S2), 197
unique proteins had significant changes in phosphorylation between
the inoculated and the mock (S0) samples from NIL-S; 121 proteins
were increased, whereas 76 proteins were decreased (Table S2 and Figure 1D).

performed on the log 2 expression of differentially expressed
modified peptides displaying similarity among treatments. Red represents
significantly increased modified peptides. Green represents significantly
decreased modified peptides. Gray represents the modified peptides
having no quantitative information.

2.2 Phosphopeptide Motif Identification in Cotton
Roots in Response to V. dahliae
Protein post-translational modification was performed by an upstream
enzyme to identify substrate-specific motifs. Sequence conservation
at phosphosites was evaluated for protein post-translational modification
and phosphorylation site prediction. Motif-x was used to predict motifs
by Motif-X algorithm28 in this study. In
total, 37 Ser motifs (Table S3, sheet 1)
and 4 Thr motifs (Table S3, sheet 2) were
significantly enriched. Based on the published information on the
association of these motifs with protein kinases,29 21 novel phosphorylation motifs were identified, including
19 pSer motifs and 2 pThr motifs.

For phosphorylation motifs
identified, we found eight corresponding motifs in the PhosphoMotif
Finder database (Table S3, sheet 3). Two
motifs, .......S..E.... and .......SD.E...., are potential substrates
for casein kinase II (CKII), which takes part in the cell-cycle regulation,
rhythm regulation, DNA repair, and other physiological regulatory
pathways.30 Three motifs, .......SP......,
.......SSP....., and.......TP, belong to proline-directed motifs,
which are potential substrates for pro-directed kinase, cyclin-dependent
kinase (CDK5), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), glycogen synthase
kinase 3 (GSK-3), and extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK1/2).
Some kinases, such as protein kinase A (PKA), Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent
protein kinase (CaM), and calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK)
could recognize the motifs ....R..S........ These kinases may play
roles in signal recognition and transduction of cotton in response
to infection by V. dahliae.

2.3 GO Annotation and Functional Classification
of Significantly Changed Phosphoproteins
To further understand
the functional distribution of the significant differentially expressed
phosphoproteins identified from cotton roots inoculated with V. dahliae, the phosphoproteins were annotated and
classified into cellular component (CC), molecular function (MF),
and biological process (BP) categories by Blast2GO program based on
level 2 (Figure 2).
CC analysis showed that protein phosphorylation events occurred in
various types of cells, organelles, membranes, macromolecular complexes,
and membrane-enclosed lumen both in the resistant and susceptible
genotypes (Figure 2 and Table S4). These results are consistent
with previous findings that the phosphoproteins were more localized
in intracellular organelles, cytoplasm, ribonucleoprotein complexes,
etc.29

Figure 2 GO annotation of the proteins containing
differentially expressed
phosphorylated peptides in NIL-R (R) and NIL-S (S) roots inoculated
with V. dahliae. X axis: GO terms in three categories: biological processes (marked
with red), molecular functions (marked with purple), and cellular
compartments (marked with orange); Y axis on the
left: the percentage of annotated proteins in all of the differentially
expressed proteins; Y axis on the right: the number
of the annotated differentially expressed proteins.

BP category provides information on the phosphoproteins over-represented
in metabolic processes, biogenesis, biological regulation, or response
to biotic/abiotic stress, cellular processes, cellular component organization,
and single-organism processes (Figure 2 and Table S4). Furthermore, level 3 scans indicated that 9, 6, 7, and 6 protein
kinases were linked to the cotton response to fungal infection in
the R1 vs R0, R2 vs R0, S1 vs S0, and S2 vs S0 comparisons, respectively
(Table S4). These phosphoproteins are involved
in plant hormone signal transduction (EIN2),31 respiratory burst oxidase (RBOH),32 plant–pathogen
interaction (RIN4),33 and translation initiation
factor (EIF4G)34 and may be associated
with the cotton against V. dahliae.

MF category reveals the over-representation of phosphoproteins
involved in catalytic activity and binding. The latter includes enzyme
regulator activity, transporter activity, structural molecule activity,
and nucleic-acid-binding transcription factor activity (Figure 2). In the R1 vs R0 comparison,
there were 208 binding proteins and 108 catalytic proteins; the corresponding
values were 163 and 74 in the R2 vs R0 comparison, 138 and 83 in S1
vs S0 comparison, and 116 and 55 in S2 vs S0 comparison (Figure S2 and Table S4). A level 5 scan identified
33, 16, 27, and 15 protein kinases in the R1 vs R0, R2 vs R0, S1 vs
S0, and S2 vs S0 comparisons, respectively (Table S4). Most of these kinases are essential signaling proteins
and receptors for and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in plants,
such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK1_3),35 calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPK),36 phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (pckA),37 and protein kinase (PRPF4B, CKI, SRPK3, STK23, PRKWNK,
and CSNK1E). These proteins and relevant signaling pathways may play
crucial roles in the cotton–V. dahliae interaction.

2.4 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
and Genomes (KEGG)
Pathway and Regulatory Roles of Phosphoproteins with Significant Changes
KEGG online service tool KAAS maps KEGG pathways of those proteins
with significant differences in phosphorylation. These phosphoproteins
are found to be involved in many essential biological pathways, including
plant–pathogen interaction, plant hormone signal transduction,
HIF-1 signaling pathway, ABC transporters, mTOR signaling pathway,
MAPK signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, etc. (Figure S3 and Table S5). Further research is
needed to understand the precise role of these pathways in the cotton
against V. dahliae.

Four phosphoproteins
related to plant–pathogen interactions were identified: calcium-dependent
protein kinase (CDPK28, Gh_A11G1615), respiratory burst oxidase (RBOH,
Gh_D05G2471), calcium-binding protein CML (CML41, Gh_A11G1729), and
RPM1-interacting protein 4 (RIN4) (Gh_D08G2088) (Figure 3 and Table S5). Compared to that of the mock, the phosphorylation level
of CDPK increased significantly at 1 dpi, with 5.5-fold and 4-fold
changes observed in the susceptible and resistant cultivars, respectively,
but these levels decreased at 3 dpi. The transcript levels for CDPK
were 3-fold higher in the roots inoculated with Vd080 than in the
mock, 12 hpi, and then decreased thereafter. In contrast, the transcript
levels for RBOH were lower in the inoculated roots than in the mock.
Both CML41 and RIN4 were not phosphorylated in the cotton roots before
inoculation but were significantly phosphorylated after inoculation. The phosphorylation
level of RIN4 was 6-fold and 2.7-fold higher in roots of the resistant
cultivar than in the resistant cultivar, 1 and 3 dpi, respectively.
The transcript levels for CML41 and RIN4 were higher (from 12 hpi
onward) in the inoculated roots than in the mock (Figure 4). RIN4 is related to plant–pathogen
interactions. For example, RIN4 phosphorylation was induced by AvrB
(Pseudomonas syringae) targeting a
host guardee protein RIN4 in Arabidopsis. Then, phosphorylated
RIN4 activates the immune receptor RPM1 to mount defense.38−41

Many phosphoproteins involved in plant defense signaling
pathways
were identified in cotton roots. The mTOR signaling pathway, the HIF-1
signaling pathway, and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway have been usually
described in animals and microbes.42−44 These are related to
glycogen metabolism and cell-cycle progression, including reactive
oxygen species generation. The small subunit ribosomal protein S6e
(RPS6) was identified in the three signaling pathways in this study
(Figure S4A). The RPS6 belongs to TIR-NBS-LRR
protein, which regulates the resistance of Arabidopsis to P. syringae by effector HopA1.45 In barley, resistance locus RPS6 as an intermediate
enhanced host resistance to wheat stripe rust.46 These results showed that phosphorylation proteins and
the associated signaling pathways play a regulatory role in the cotton–V. dahliae interaction.

Two phosphoproteins
were identified in the MAPK signaling pathway:
MAP kinase substrate 1 (MKS1) and mitogen-activated protein kinase
1/3 (MAPK1/3). Also, this is indicated that the phosphorylation of
the two proteins may be involved in cell death, defense response,
and camalexin synthesis. Phosphorylation events were also found in
the ethylene (ET) signaling pathway, including the ethylene receptor
EIN2 (Figure S4B), which is a positive
regulator of ethylene signaling.47 Another
phosphoprotein from the ARR-B family (two-component response regulator)
involved in camalexin synthesis (Figure S4C) and associated with cell division and shoot initiation was identified.

2.5 Comparison of Phosphoproteins between Resistant
and Susceptible Lines
Thirty phosphoproteins were significantly
changed common to all of the following comparisons: R1 vs R0, R2 vs
R0, S1 vs S0, and S2 vs S0 (Figure 5 and Table S6). Two phosphoproteins
(Gh_A05G3831 and Gh_D07G0502) belonging to the adenosine 5′-triphosphate
(ATP)-binding cassette were increased in both susceptible and resistant
genotypes after inoculation. Another phosphoprotein (Gh_A10G0583)
belonging to the ABC transporter G family member 36 was also increased
in both lines after inoculation (Table S2). One calcium ion binding protein (Gh_A01G0834) was increased in
the resistant lines but was decreased in the susceptible lines. When
plants sense and respond to stimuli, including biotic and abiotic
stresses, a series of PRRs (pattern recognition receptors) localized
in the plasma membrane recognize the damage-associated molecular patterns
(DAMPs) and microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs), and induce
a rapid [Ca2+]cyt elevation in plant cells.48,49 The burst of reactive oxygen species
and synthesis of defense-related plant hormones, such as jasmonic
acid (JA), ethylene (ET), and salicylic acid (SA), are regulated by
a series of Ca2+ signaling and proteins relays.50−52

diagram representing overlapping of significantly changed
phosphoproteins shared between phosphoproteomes of R1 vs R0, R2 vs
R0, S1 vs S0, and S2 vs S0 comparisons. R: NIL-R lines; S: NIL-S lines;
R0 and S0: mock; R1 and S1: after 1 day of V. dahliae inoculation; R2 and S2: after 3 days of V. dahliae inoculation.

There were 92 phosphoproteins
common to both the R1 vs R0 and R2
vs R0 comparisons but not to the S1 vs S0 and S2 vs S0 comparisons.
However, there were 38 phosphoproteins common to both the S1 vs S0
and the S2 vs S0 comparisons but not to the R1 vs R0 and R2 vs R0
comparisons (Figure 5 and Table S6). Some of these phosphoproteins
were shown to play crucial roles in plant–pathogen interactions. For example, the high mobility group box domain (Gh_A02G0873) was
increased (by 5-fold) in resistant lines but not in susceptible lines
(Table S2). The HMGB3 protein is a novel
plant DAMP, which induces hallmark innate immune responses through
receptor-like kinases BKK1 and BAK1, regulating the MAPK activation
to induce the plant immune response. In addition, HMGB3 could bind
salicylic acid (SA) to inhibit its DAMP activity in Arabidopsis against Botrytis cinerea.53

3 Conclusions
To understand
the molecular defense mechanisms that mediate defense
of cotton roots against V. dahliae infection,
a comparative phosphoproteomic analysis was performed. A total of
639 phosphoproteins, showing significant differences between the mock
and inoculated samples in cotton roots in the resistant and susceptible
cotton lines, revealed the abundance of known and novel phosphorylated
defense-related proteins, signaling-related proteins, transport-related
proteins, ATP-binding-related proteins, microtubule-associated proteins,
etc. The roles of many of these phosphoproteins are not clearly understood
in plant defense. Therefore, this global overview of changes in phosphorylation
from cotton roots in response to V. dahliae provides a new perspective for future studies that aim to understand
cotton responses to pathogen infection.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 V. dahliae Culture
and Cotton Growth
A defoliating V. dahliae strain Vd080 was isolated from a cotton field in Xinji, Hebei province,
China. Then, this strain was grown on PDA medium (potato dextrose
agar). The mycelia were collected and cultured in liquid Czapek’s
medium as described previously.54 The final
concentration of the spore suspension was adjusted to 1 × 107 conidia/mL with sterile water.

The upland cotton (G. hirsutum) cultivar, Zhongzhimian 2, is highly
resistant to V. dahliae, and cultivar
Jimian 11 is susceptible to this pathogen. The introgression lines
BC6F3:6 were generated from the advanced backcross
and repeated selfing using Zhongzhimian 2 as the recipient parent
and Jimian 11 as the donor parent. Two materials NIL-R and NIL-S selected
from the BC6F3:6 population were resistant and
susceptible to verticillium wilt, respectively. NIL-R and NIL-S seeds
were delinted with H2SO4 (98%), sterilized in
1% NaClO for 1 min, and then washed three times in sterile water.
These seeds were sown in sterile nutrient soil. When the cotyledons
were fully expanded, cotton seedlings were grown hydroponically as
described previously55 and maintained in
a controlled environment chamber under conditions of 28 °C, 16/8
h photoperiod, and 80% relative humidity.

4.2 Inoculation
of Cotton Seedlings and Sample
Collection
When the first euphylla was fully expanded, the
cotton seedlings were inoculated with V. dahliae conidial suspension (1 × 107 conidia/mL) by the
dipping root method for 45 min. Control plants were inoculated with
liquid Czapek’s medium. Roots were harvested at 1 and 3 days
after inoculation (dpi), and the samples were immediately used for
extraction of proteins. For gene expression analysis, roots were harvested
at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 hpi (hours past inoculation) and
stored at −80 °C for subsequent use. Three biological
replicates were performed for each combination (inoculation/control
and time).

4.3 Protein Extraction and
Tryptic Digestion
Cotton roots were cut into 1 cm segments
in length and washed with
sterile water four times, each lasting for 5 min. Then, the segments
were blotted dry with a piece of filter paper, placed into a mortar,
immediately frozen by liquid nitrogen, and grinded. The total protein
of roots was extracted by the trichloroacetic acid (TCA)/acetone precipitation
method.56 The Bradford method was used
to determine the protein concentration57 with BSA as a standard. The final protein pellet was resuspended
in a lysis buffer and then centrifuged at 20 000g for 30 min. The mixture was reduced by 20 mM DTT for 2.5 h at 37
°C and then alkylated by 40 mM IAA in the dark at 25 °C
for 30 min. Then, the final urea concentration was adjusted to 1.5
M by deionized water. The digestion was performed using trypsin with
a ratio of 1/50 (w/w) at 37 °C for 18 h. The resulting mixture
was desalted by an SPE-C18 column (Waters, WAT051910). The filtrate
was collected and freeze-dried. The resulting peptides were stored
at −20 °C for further use.

4.4 Phosphopeptide
Enrichment
The peptide
mixture was redissolved in 1.4 mL of precooled IAP buffer (10 mM Na2HPO4, 50 mM MOPS, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.0) and lyophilized
to dryness. TiO2 beads were then added to the peptide mixture
with 1X DHB buffer [16% CAN, 0.6% DHB, 0.02% TFA] and then vibrated
for 40 min. Then, the supernatant was removed after centrifugation;
the beads were put into a tip (Eppendorf, Germany) with a stopper
and then washed three times with equilibration buffer I (200 mM NaCl
50% ACN, and 6% TFA) and then three times with equilibration buffer
II (0.1% TFA, 30% ACN). Finally, the phosphopeptides were eluted with
50 μL of the elution buffer (NH4OH, pH 10.5) and concentrated
under vacuum and then dissolved in 20 μL of 0.1% formic acid
(FA) for MS analysis.

4.5 Mass Spectrometry Analysis
The mass spectrometry (MS) data were collected by Shanghai Applied
Protein Technology, which was performed on a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer
(Thermo Scientific) coupled to an EASY-nLC1000 nano LC. The peptides
were loaded onto a reverse-phase trap column (RP-C18, 150 μm
× 20 mm, Thermo EASY column SC001 traps) connected to the C18
reversed-phase analytical column (RP-C18, 150 μm × 100
mm, Thermo EASY column SC200). Mobile phase A was 0.1% FA (v/v) in
acetonitrile–H2O (acetonitrile, 2%), and mobile
phase B was 0.1% FA in acetonitrile–H2O (acetonitrile,
84%). A linear gradient was performed at a flow rate of 300 nL/min:
0–220 min, 0–55% B; 220–228 min, 55–100%
B; 228–240 min, 100% B.

The mass spectrometer was operated
in the positive ion mode with the peptide recognition mode enabled.29 A data-dependent top10 method was used to acquire
the MS data by survey scans (300–1800 m/z) for HCD fragmentation. The resolution for scans was set
to 70 000 at m/z 200 and
the resolution for HCD spectra was set to 17,500 at m/z 200, and the isolation window was 2 m/z. In each scan cycle, the number of precursors
selected for tandem MS was 20, and the charge state screening parameter
was set at 2. The underfill ratio was defined as 0.1%, and the normalized
collision energy was 30 eV.

4.6 Database Search and Quantification
The observed MS/MS spectra were searched against a G. hirsutum L. database (NBI_Gossypium_hirsutum_v1.1.pep.fasta)
using the MaxQuant software (version 1.5.3.17)58,59 identification and quantitation analysis. Trypsin was selected for
the enzyme setting. An initial mass tolerance of precursor ions was
set at 6 and 20 ppm, and two missed cleavages were allowed. Oxidation
of methionine residues was selected as a variable modification, and
carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues was selected as a fixed
modification. The false discovery rates (FDRs) of peptides and proteins
were both set at 1%.

The label-free quantification was performed
by MaxQuant software with intensity-based absolute quantification
(iBAQ).58,60 The “Matching Between Runs”
feature was enabled and set to 2 min. Only proteins or phosphosites
retained were quantified, in at least two of the three biological
replicates in at least one sample. The phosphorylated peptides with
quantification ratios of >2.0 or <0.5 and p values
of <0.05 were defined as statistically different.

4.7 Motif-X Analysis
The motifs of identified
phosphosites were analyzed using a BioPerl script to extract significantly
enriched amino acid motifs.61,62 There were 13 amino
acids in the sequence window, including the modified site and six
upstream/downstream amino acids from the modified site. These sequences
were used in Motif-x to predict motifs in this study (parameters:
width: 13; occurrences: 20; background: species).

4.8 Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG Pathway Analysis
Identified
proteins were annotated using a Blast2GO suite.63 GO annotation (Gene Ontology), GO-Enzyme-Code,
and other search tools were used to conduct the phosphoprotein functional
classification. The identified phosphoproteins were analyzed against
a reference database from P3DB to search for homologues.
For annotation augmentation, protein sequences were blasted by InterProScan64 against EBI (The European Bioinformatics Institute)
databases to obtain phosphoprotein domains (motif). Then, GO terms
were modulated using the annotation augmentation tool ANNEX.

The KOBAS 2.0 (KEGG Orthology-Based Annotation System) program65 was applied to map the significant differentially
expressed phosphorylated proteins to the terms in the Kyoto Encyclopedia
of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database.66 Due to p values of <0.05, the KEGG pathways
were considered significantly enriched in cotton root proteins.

4.9 Cluster Analysis of Phosphorylated Peptides
The hierarchical clustering analysis was performed by Cluster 3.0
and Java Treeview software by a Euclidean distance algorithm and an
average linkage clustering algorithm for similarity measures and clustering,
respectively.

4.10 Gene Expression Analysis
Total RNA
from roots at 12, 24, 48, and 72 hpi was extracted using a modified
cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method.67 The cDNA was synthesized using the M-MLV reverse transcriptase (TaKaRa)
following the manufacturer’s instructions.

The relative
expression level of genes was assessed by reverse transcription quantitative
PCR (RT-qPCR) based on a previously published method68 using gene-specific primers (Table S7). The cotton UBQ7 gene was used in RT-qPCR as an internal
control. Three independent biological and technical repeats were performed.

4.11 Statistical Analysis
All relevant
data in this study were presented as mean ± standard error of
at least three independent biological replicates. A t-test was carried out to test the statistical significances by SigmaPlot
version 12.0 (Systat Software, San Jose, CA).
