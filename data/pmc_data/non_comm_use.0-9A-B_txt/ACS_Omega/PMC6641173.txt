Mixtures or composites
of titania and carbon have gained considerable
research interest as innovative catalyst supports for low- and intermediate-temperature
proton-exchange membrane fuel cells. For applications in electrocatalysis,
variations in the local physicochemical properties of the employed
materials can have significant effects on their behavior as catalyst
supports. To assess
microscopic heterogeneities in composition, structure, and morphology,
a microscopic multitechnique approach is required. In this work, compact
anodic TiO2 films on planar polycrystalline Ti substrates
are converted into carbon/titania composites or multiphase titanium
oxycarbides through carbothermal treatment in an acetylene/argon atmosphere
in a flow reactor. The local chemical composition, structure, and
morphology of the converted films are studied with scanning photoelectron
microscopy, micro-Raman spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy
and are related with the crystallographic orientations of the Ti substrate
grains by means of electron backscatter diffraction. Different annealing
temperatures, ranging from 550 to 850 °C, are found to yield
different substrate grain-dependent chemical compositions, structures,
and morphologies. The present study reveals individual time scales
for the carbothermal conversion and subsequent surface re-oxidation
on substrate grains of a given orientation. Furthermore, it demonstrates
the power of a microscopic multitechnique approach for studying polycrystalline
heterogeneous materials for electrocatalytic applications.

1 Introduction
In
catalysis and electrocatalysis, a detailed understanding of
the local physicochemical properties of the active materials is of
utmost importance to develop optimized functional materials. Many
fundamental investigations on catalytic materials are based on the
study of single crystalline substrates because their well-defined
surfaces facilitate the relation of materials properties to observed
processes, such as pathways of catalytic reactions that are promoted
on differently oriented crystalline surfaces.1−3 However, real
catalyst materials require a high surface area and are synthesized
in the form of supported nanoparticles or high-surface-area powders,
which in most cases bring about nanoscopically or microscopically
heterogeneous physicochemical properties. In view of the important
role of the support, which needs to stabilize the catalyst nanoparticles,
to ensure electrical conductivity or which under certain conditions
can positively influence the overall catalytic performance, it is
necessary to devote sufficient research efforts to the investigation
of innovative support materials on a microscopic basis. A model system
that constitutes
a compromise between real high-surface-area powders and a well-defined
single crystalline surface with assessable properties is provided
by a polycrystalline planar substrate. With the emergence of experimental
methods that combine microscopy with complementary analysis methods,
such as photoelectron or vibrational spectroscopy, diffractometry,
or electrochemistry, the investigation of planar polycrystalline materials
has opened up new perspectives in materials research.4−7

Hybrid or composite materials of titania and carbon (Ti–O–C)
have gained remarkable interest in the search for suitable catalyst
support materials for proton-exchange membrane fuel cells, as they
may provide a higher corrosion resistance than that of commonly used
carbon-based supports in combination with a high electrical conductivity8−10 and may enhance the overall catalytic activity.11−13 Planar model
systems consisting of thermally carburized compact anodic titania
films on a polycrystalline titanium substrate (Tipoly)
provide a flexible model system to study the relationship between
the physicochemical properties of Ti–O–C materials,
which can be tailored via the synthesis conditions, and their electrochemical
and electrocatalytic performances.14−16 In particular, different
annealing temperatures during the carbothermal treatment of anodic
TiO2 yield significantly different average physicochemical
properties of the obtained Ti–O–C films,14 which in turn strongly affect the catalytic
properties of Ti–O–C-supported Pt nanoparticles (Pt/Ti–O–C)
toward the electrochemical oxidation of ethanol in an acidic electrolyte.15 Interestingly, a clear influence of the Ti substrate
grains on the local (electro)chemical stability of Pt/Ti–O–C
on Tipoly was observed,15 which
demonstrates the necessity for the use of microscopic analysis tools
to gain a deep understanding of the local property–performance
relationships on such model systems. In a previous publication, we
have investigated the effect of titanium substrate grain orientations
on the crystallization of compact anodic TiO2 and on the
reactive decomposition of acetylene during carbothermal treatment
with acetylene at a relatively low annealing temperature. A substrate
grain-dependent chemical composition and structure of the obtained
C/TiO2 composite material has been observed in this study.7 The effect of annealing temperature on the final
average composition of Ti–O–C films, prepared at relatively
high temperatures, has been explained with a thermodynamic model,
where diffusion of carbon and oxygen in the compact anodic TiO2 has been taken into account.14 A common consideration of both substrate grain orientation and annealing
temperature is still missing. However, it is necessary to gain a deeper
understanding and control of the synthesis of such Ti–O–C
systems.

Therefore, in the present study, the effect of annealing
temperature
on the substrate grain-dependent physicochemical properties of carburized
planar anodic TiO2 films on Tipoly is investigated
using both microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. Ti–O–C
films are synthesized via carbothermal treatment with acetylene at
four different annealing temperatures, that is, 550, 650, 750, and
850 °C. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), scanning photoelectron
microscopy (SPEM), and micro-Raman spectroscopy results of the carburized
films are correlated with the crystallographic orientation of the
substrate grains, which is assessed through electron backscatter diffraction
(EBSD).

2 Results
EBSD was used to generate crystalline
orientation maps of the Tipoly substrates, which will be
represented as surface-normal
projected inverse pole figure orientation maps in the following. From
these maps, the orientations of the hexagonal lattice of Ti with respect
to the substrate surface, defined by the three Euler angles, are extracted
for individual grains.

To define the crystallographic plane
parallel to the sample surface,
only the two Euler angles, Φ and φ2, need to
be considered.17 Angle Φ describes
the tilt of the c-axis of the hexagonal unit cell
with respect to the substrate surface, and φ2 describes
the azimuthal rotation of the hexagonal unit cell about its c-axis with respect to a reference orientation with φ2 = 0°. Because of the hexagonal symmetry, the values
of the orientation angles can be restricted to 0° ≤ Φ
≤ 90° and 0° ≤ φ2 ≤
30°. According to our previous work, it is sufficient to take
into account four ranges of tilt angles, Φ, to gain insight
into the physicochemical properties of thermally treated planar anodic
TiO2 films.7 In addition, we
subdivide the orientations with Φ > 50° into 0°
≤
φ2 ≤ 15° and 15° ≤ φ2 ≤ 30°. Table 1 lists the five groups of Ti substrate orientations
that are considered in the present study and shows the surface-projected
hexagonal cells that are used for labeling.

and Representative Projected Hexagonal Cells
Figure 1 shows scanning
electron micrographs of TiOC, synthesized at different temperatures.
After the thermal treatments at temperatures of up to 750 °C,
the grain boundaries of the Ti substrate are still visible through
the TiOC. The morphology of TiOC550 and TiOC750 is clearly affected by the crystallographic orientation of the underlying
Ti substrate grains. In particular, substrate grains with tilt angles
0° ≤ Φ ≤ 40° can be easily distinguished
from substrate grains with tilt angles Φ ≥ 50°,
due to apparent differences in the morphologies of the TiOC overlayers.
TiOC650 is characterized by a granular morphology with
no pronounced substrate grain dependency; only the grain boundaries
can be recognized. After carbothermal treatment at 850 °C, the
initial grain boundaries of the substrate disappeared and extended
areas of uniform morphology formed. No interdependence between morphology
and the original substrate grain orientation is visible due to significant
substrate grain growth at this temperature.18

areas on differently oriented substrate grains (TiOC550, TiOC650, TiOC750) or areas with different
TiOC morphologies (TiOC850). Projected hexagonal cells:
approximate crystallographic orientation of the Ti substrate grains.

The comparison between the morphologies
of TiOC750 and
TiOC850 suggests that the surface undergoes an ordering
at high annealing temperatures. The high-resolution micrographs (insets)
of TiOC850 show ordered morphologies, such as triangular
shapes (left bottom) or stepped terraces (right top). The phase change
of the Ti substrate from α-Ti (hcp structure) to β-Ti
(bcc structure) does not happen below 882 °C and can therefore
not be responsible for this ordering.19

Figure 2 depicts
chemical maps of the Ti 2p3/2 and C 1s core-level electrons
extracted from SPEM of TiOC and the corresponding EBSD maps of the
Ti substrate. Apparently, the surface chemistry of TiOC550 and TiOC750 is affected by the orientation of the substrate
grains: TiOC films on type A and B grains (0° ≤ Φ
≤ 40°, ∼Ti(0001)) show a clearly different average
brightness in the chemical maps than that of films on type D and E
grains (50° ≤ Φ ≤ 90°, ∼Ti{hki0}). In the case of TiOC750, several grain
boundaries can be identified. On the other hand, the surface of TiOC850 has a relatively homogeneous composition that is independent
of the substrate grains in the mapped area. The chemical maps of TiOC650 show several areas with dark spots and less pronounced
grain boundaries.

For each type of substrate grain,
X-ray photoelectron (XP) spectra
of the Ti 2p3/2 and C 1s core levels are extracted from
the photoelectron maps and plotted in Figure 3. Each spectrum is obtained from a rectangular
area on a substrate grain and represents the average surface composition
of TiOC on that grain. An alternative representation of the XP spectra
is given in Figures S1 and S2 in the Supporting
Information (SI). The Ti 2p3/2 signals show that all TiOCs
contain TiO2 (459 eV)5 and that
TiOC650 and TiOC750 additionally contain a considerable
fraction of TiC and/or TiO species (454.9 eV)5,20 and
some TiOx sub-oxides (456–458 eV,
1 < x < 2)5,14 at the surface.

Figure 3 Spectra

maps of TiOC, acquired on top of substrate grains with five different
orientations, as indicated by the hexagonal cells using the color-orientation
code. (a, e) TiOC550, (b, f) TiOC650, (c, g)
TiOC750, and (d, h) TiOC850. The spectra in
(b, c) are scaled to the TiO2 component height.

In the case of TiOC550, TiOC650, and TiOC750, the pronounced peak in the C 1s spectra,
centered at 284.5
eV, is attributed to an sp2-hybridized (graphitic) carbon
(C=C) (Figure 3e–g).5,21 The C 1s peak found for TiOC850 (Figure 3h) is shifted toward the binding energy of an sp3-hybridized
(diamond-like) carbon (C–C at 285.6 eV),5,21 indicating
the presence of amorphous carbon on the surface.22 It can be seen that only TiOC650 and TiOC750 contain a notable amount of carbidic carbon (281.7 eV)
within a film depth of ∼1.4–2.3 nm (calculated for TiO2 and C=C), which is analyzed with SPEM.21

Analysis of the XP spectra reveals that
carbothermal treatment
at 550 °C mainly produces graphitic carbon on top of TiO2. A significant reduction in the anodic TiO2 film
is obtained through carbothermal treatments at 650 and 750 °C,
generating TiC (TiO) and TiOx species,
and the resultant TiOC is covered by a relatively high amount of graphitic
carbon. The surface of TiOC850 consists of TiO2 covered by amorphous carbon.

Both chemical maps (Figure 2) and XP spectra
(Figure 3) show that
the conversion from TiO2 to
TiC (TiO) and TiOx depends both on the
annealing temperature and substrate texture. On TiOC550 (Figures 2a and 3a,e), the relative amount of graphitic carbon is
significantly enhanced and the fraction of TiO2 is small
on top of substrate grains of types A and B (∼Ti(0001)), with
0° ≤ Φ ≤ 40°. A detailed investigation
on the effect of substrate grains on the chemical surface composition
of TiOC550 has been published elsewhere.7 The XP spectra of TiOC650 (Figure 3b,f) suggest an exceptional
surface chemistry on top of substrate grains of type D (∼Ti{101̅0},
see Table 1): on these
grains, the conversion of the anodic film to TiC (TiO) and TiOx phases is significantly lower and slightly
less graphitic carbon is generated on the surface. This is in line
with the TiC/TiO2 and C/BG chemical maps (Figure 2c), which show a high density
of dark spots and thus a lower average content of TiC (TiO) and carbon
in the TiOC on top of these grains. The variation in the surface chemistry
of TiOC650 on top of the other types of substrate grains
is less strong. On TiOC750, a pronounced substrate grain-dependent
oxide film reduction can be observed, with the highest fraction of
TiC (TiO) and TiOx being present on top
of substrate grains D and E, with 50° ≤ Φ ≤
90° (∼Ti{hki0}), and the lowest, on substrate
grains A and B, with 0° ≤ Φ ≤ 40° (∼Ti(0001)),
which is in accordance with the chemical maps (Figures 3c,g and 2b). At the
same time, the total amount of graphitic and carbidic carbon species
in TiOC750 is slightly higher on substrate grains with
50° ≤ Φ ≤ 90° (∼Ti{hki0}) than that on substrate grains with 0° ≤ Φ ≤
40° (∼Ti(0001)). An intermediate composition is found
on substrate grains C, with 40° ≤ Φ ≤ 50°.
No difference is visible in the XP spectra of TiOC850 on
differently oriented substrate grains, which confirms the homogeneous
contrast of its chemical maps (Figures 3d,h and 2d). The highest overall
fraction of TiC is found in TiOC750 on top of ∼Ti{hki0} grains. The highest overall amount of (amorphous or
graphitic) carbon is found in TiOC650 on top of all substrate
grains except for ∼Ti{101̅0} (Figures 3f and S2). Considering
only TiOC650 and TiOC750, an almost opposite
chemical surface composition is observed on ∼Ti{101̅0}
and ∼Ti(0001) substrate grains: TiOC650 contains
a high amount of TiC and C on ∼Ti(0001) and a low amount on
∼Ti{101̅0}, whereas the contrary is found for TiOC750.

The SPEM results reveal that both annealing temperature
and substrate
texture determine the TiOC surface chemistry. TiC-rich TiOC can be
synthesized through carburization of anodic TiO2 at 650
or 750 °C. However, it depends on substrate texture, whether
a higher average TiC content is obtained in TiOC650 or
in TiOC750 under the given annealing conditions (see Figure S1): in the case of a Ti substrate with
a large fraction of ∼Ti{hki0} grains, the
average TiC content can be expected to be higher in TiOC750 than that in TiOC650; a Ti substrate with grain orientations
restricted to 40° ≤ Φ ≤ 50° yields most
likely a similar average TiC content in TiOC650 and TiOC750; finally, a Ti substrate with mainly ∼Ti(0001) grains
can be expected to yield a higher average TiC content in TiOC650 than that in TiOC750.

Micro-Raman spectroscopy
was performed to gain information on the
substrate grain-dependent structure and chemical composition of the
anodic TiO2 before and after carbothermal treatment at
different temperatures. Figure 4 depicts the Raman spectra of as-anodized TiO2 and
of TiOC550, TiOC650, and TiOC750 on
top of ∼Ti{101̅0} and ∼Ti(0001) substrate grains,
for which SPEM reveals a clearly different TiOC composition. As the
initial grain boundaries of the titanium substrate vanished after
carbothermal treatment at 850 °C, Raman spectra of TiOC850 were acquired on several spots of different appearance in the optical
microscope (black and gray spectra in Figure 4). Photographs of the TiOC surfaces are shown
in Figure 4e. An alternative
representation of the micro-Raman spectra is given in Figure S3. The peaks at 1350 and 1600 cm–1 in Figure 4a,c correspond to the D and G bands of the nanocrystalline
graphitic carbon.23Figure 4b,d depicts the spectral range of the bands
associated with Raman-active TiO2, TiOx, or TiCy phases. Anatase and
rutile TiO2 are characterized by vibrational bands marked
with dashed lines and are labeled as A and R, respectively.24,25 Peaks at ∼267 and ∼347 cm–1, marked
with dotted lines, can be attributed to the most intense Raman signals
of Ti2O3.26,27 Stoichiometric TiC
has no Raman-active vibrational modes. However, the disorder in the
cubic (NaCl) crystal structure of TiCy (with y < 1) that is induced by carbon vacancies
activates the A1g, Eg, and T2g modes
for Raman scattering.28 The Raman spectrum
of TiC0.67 has been reported to contain five peaks at 265,
340, 372, 596, and 661 cm–1;29 they are labeled in Figure 4b,d.

and TiOC750 on top of (a, b) ∼Ti{101̅0} and

different optical appearances (black and gray spectra). Purple spectrum

The absence of distinct bands associated with crystalline
(rutile
or anatase) TiO2 evidences that the as-grown anodic film
is amorphous (purple spectrum in Figure 4a). Carbothermal treatment at 550 °C
leads to crystallization of the oxide, generating a mixed phase of
rutile and anatase, and to a slight reduction, which is evidenced
by the features ascribed to Ti2O3. The highest
fraction of rutile is detected on top of ∼Ti(0001) (compare Figures 4b,d and S3).7,30 There are no bands
associated with TiCy phases in the spectra
of TiOC550. The blue optical appearance of TiOC550 indicates that the ∼53 nm thick anodic oxide film is only
slightly reduced, where the color is most likely a result of interference
effects in combination with color centers, for example, due to oxygen
vacancies (Figure 4e). Note that the as-grown anodic film has a different blue color,
which arises from interference effects only (see the Supporting Information
of ref (7)).

No graphitic carbon is detected prior to the carbothermal treatment.
The carbon bands are intense for TiOC550 and continuously
decrease with increasing annealing temperature on both types of substrate
grains (Figure 4a,c).
The Raman signal of the graphitic carbon is notably enhanced for TiOC550 compared to that observed for TiOC650 and TiOC750, whereas the XP spectra suggest that there is less elemental
carbon on TiOC550 (Figure 3). This enhancement of the carbon bands can be explained
by resonant Raman scattering with the π-states of graphite,
which is typical for thin graphite layers with a low content of defects.31 The optically transparent anodic oxide underneath
the graphite layer may contribute to this enhancement.32

The Raman spectra of the TiO2, TiOx, and TiCy phases considerably
change when the annealing temperature is enhanced from 550 to 650
°C (Figures 4b,d
and S3). Whereas the anatase and rutile
phases of TiO2 are present in TiOC550, the corresponding
bands (in particular, the characteristic low-frequency band of anatase)
are not visible in the spectra of TiOC650, TiOC750, and TiOC850. Instead, Raman-active TiOx and TiCy phases appear and,
at the same time, the optical appearance of TiOC changes to metallic
gray (Figure 4e). This
indicates that the oxide film is completely converted to a TiOxCy phase, which
is mainly a solid solution of TiO and TiC and has been reported to
have semi-metallic properties,5,14,21,33 through carbothermal treatments
at 650, 750, and 850 °C. The fraction of TiO2 on the
surface, detected with SPEM, appears to be too small to considerably
contribute to the Raman response. Only the slightly enhanced signal
intensity at 447 cm–1 (Eg band of rutile
TiO2) in the gray spectrum of TiOC850 with respect
to that in the black spectrum may be related to the presence of TiO2 (Figures 4b and S3). Without data on well-defined
TiOxCy reference
materials, it is not possible to quantify the phase composition and
stoichiometry of the TiOxCy phase in the bulk of TiOC using Raman spectroscopy.
Therefore, the observed differences between the Raman responses of
TiOC650, TiOC750, and TiOC850 can
only be interpreted in a qualitative manner and suggest an effect
of the annealing temperature on the stoichiometry and/or defectivity
of the converted films.28,29 In the case of TiOC650 and TiOC750, a weak substrate grain orientation
effect on the Raman response can also be observed (see Figure S3). A relation of the properties of TiOC850 with the initial substrate grains is not possible, but
local variations in phase composition are evidenced by notable differences
between the black and gray spectra in Figure 4b,d (see also Figure S3).

A thorough investigation of TiO550 with
micro-Raman
spectroscopy is reported in ref (7), in which a marked relation between the substrate grain
orientations and crystalline phases of TiO2 as well as
the amount of deposited graphitic carbon was found.

3 Discussion
The presented results show that the final physicochemical
properties
of carbothermally produced TiOC on Tipoly, such as the
chemical composition, phase composition, and surface morphology, depend
on the annealing temperature and underlying substrate grain orientations.
It should be noted that the gas atmosphere during the carbothermal
treatment constitutes an important synthesis parameter as well: very
similar chemical maps to those of TiOC750 are obtained
by carburization of planar anodic TiO2 films on Tipoly under ultrahigh vacuum
conditions using ethylene as a carbon source.5

To summarize the results obtained with SPEM and micro-Raman
spectroscopy, Figure 5 depicts simplified
schematic models representing the cross-sectional compositions of
TiOC on top of substrate grains with ∼Ti(101̅0) and ∼Ti(0001)
orientations for the different annealing temperatures. TiOxCy represents here
the solid solution of TiC and TiO, as well as TiOx phases. The different thicknesses of the compact, as-grown
anodic TiO2 on top of differently oriented substrate grains,
which have been reported in the literature,34−36 are neglected
in the depicted models. The film thickness is assumed to remain constant
for all carbothermal treatments. Compositional gradients are simplified
to defined phase boundaries. Carburization at 650 and 750 °C
is found to generate TiOC films with an inhomogeneous surface chemistry
on individual grains: in the case of TiOC650, SPEM reveals
micrometer-sized spots on ∼Ti(101̅0), with compositions
that differ from the average (Figure 2c), and in the case of TiOC750, a different
chemical composition is observed at grain boundaries (Figure 2b). Furthermore, on the nanometric
scale, a patched surface composition of TiOC, with carbon, TiO2, and TiOxCy (if present) side by side, is possible.5 For the sake of simplicity, only the grain area-averaged
chemical composition is considered in Figure 5. This gives rise to the layered film structure
of the models, which is in line with previously performed angle-resolved
XPS measurements on TiOxCy-rich TiOC5 and is supported
by the present results of XP and micro-Raman spectroscopies, which
reveal that the TiOxCy phase in TiOC850 is covered by a TiO2 film of at least ∼1.4 nm (estimated from the photoelectron
escape depth in TiO2).

Figure 5 Schematic representation of the cross-sectional
composition of
TiOC on top of ∼Ti(101̅0) and ∼Ti(0001) substrate
grains for the different annealing temperatures. The substrate grain
orientations of TiOC850 are unknown due to grain growth
during the thermal treatment.

Carbothermal treatment at 550 °C yields a C/TiO2 composite, with TiOx species
in the
oxide film and a substrate grain-dependent amount of graphitic carbon
on the surface, which is higher on top of ∼Ti(0001) than that
on top of ∼Ti{101̅0}, as reported in ref (7). At 650, 750, and 850 °C,
the anodic TiO2 film is converted to TiOxCy in the bulk, as suggested
by the Raman results (Figure 4), but contains temperature- and substrate grain-dependent
fractions of TiO2 and carbon at the surface, as seen with
SPEM (Figures 2 and 3). The carbon is mainly graphitic (denoted by graphite)
on TiOC550, TiOC650, and TiOC750 and
amorphous (denoted by C amorph) on TiOC850. In the case
of TiOC650, there is more TiO2 and less carbon
on ∼Ti(101̅0) than those on ∼Ti(0001). In the
case of TiOC750, there is less TiO2 and more
carbon on ∼Ti(101̅0) than those on ∼Ti(0001).
The fractions of TiO2 and carbon in TiOC650 on
∼Ti(101̅0) are similar to the respective fractions in
TiOC750 on ∼Ti(0001), but there is more TiO2 and C in TiOC650 on ∼Ti(0001) than those
in TiOC750 on ∼Ti(101̅0). After carburization
at 850 °C, the amount of carbon is significantly lower and the
amount of TiO2 is significantly higher than those after
carburization at 750 and 650 °C.

The physicochemical properties
of TiOC can be understood as resulting
from several parallel processes during and after carburization that
are affected by temperature and substrate texture, which will be discussed
in the following.

3.1 Crystallization of TiO2 and Reactive
Decomposition of C2H2
During carbothermal
treatments at high temperatures, the amorphous anodic TiO2 crystallizes to anatase and/or rutile phases before C2H2 is added to the process. The crystallization kinetics
depends on the temperature and orientation of the Ti substrate, which
has consequences for the reaction of the surface with C2H2.7 Because of the higher
activity of anatase TiO2 compared to that of amorphous
TiO2 toward the reactive decomposition of C2H2, the substrate grain-dependent crystallization results
in a substrate grain-dependent amount of graphitic carbon on the surface
of TiOC550.7 Also, at higher
temperatures, the substrate texture may affect the crystallization
of anodic TiO2 and thus the reactive decomposition of C2H2. In particular, the peculiar properties of TiOC650 on top of ∼Ti{101̅0}, namely, the presence
of spots with a lower carbon coverage and a lower fraction of TiC
compared to the average, may be ascribed to the formation of a polycrystalline
TiO2 film on these grains, exposing facets of very different
reactivities. Furthermore, the significantly lower amount of carbon
on TiOC850 could be related to a low reactivity of the,
most likely rutile-rich, TiO2 film that forms at 850 °C
prior to the addition of C2H2.37 Besides the reactivity of the surface, the sticking coefficient
of C2H2 on TiO2 and the desorption
probability of possible reaction intermediates, both of which depend
on temperature and surface structure, can play a role in the substrate
grain-dependent decomposition efficiency. Because of the concomitant
diffusion of carbon into the bulk and generation of TiC at temperatures
of 650 °C and higher, the final carbon content at the surface
is not determined only by carbon layer formation.

3.2 Conversion of TiO2 to TiC and Material
Transport in TiO2 and Ti
To explain the observed
temperature-dependent average chemical composition of TiOC, thermodynamic
considerations need to be taken into account. First, sufficiently
high temperatures are required to convert TiO2 into a solid
solution of TiC and TiO.5 Second, the final
bulk composition is mostly determined by thermally activated diffusion
of both carbon into the compact anodic TiO2 and oxygen
and carbon into the Ti substrate.14 The
average amount of carbon on the surface decreases from 650 to 850
°C, which can be attributed partly to the higher diffusion kinetics
of carbon at higher temperatures and partly to the lower carbon-formation
efficiency. It is noteworthy that the amorphous carbon found on TiOC850 most likely originates from contamination of TiO2 that is not covered by graphitic carbon from the thermal C2H2 treatment, after exposure to ambient air. The results
obtained with micro-Raman spectroscopy suggest a temperature- and
substrate grain-dependent stoichiometry and/or defectivity of the
TiOxCy phase
in TiOC, which is very likely a consequence of the temperature- and
substrate grain-dependent carbon supply and diffusion kinetics. At
850 °C, both oxygen and, in particular, carbon can diffuse into
the Ti substrate, promoting the formation of a carbon-poor TiOxCy phase.14

The main influence of substrate grain
orientations on the conversion may be an indirect effect controlled
by the initial formation of polycrystalline TiO2, with
a substrate grain-dependent phase composition and preferential orientation.
First-principles calculations suggest anisotropic migration of carbon
in the tetragonal lattices of anatase (c/a = 2.51) and rutile TiO2 (c/a = 0.64).38,39 Therefore, substrate
grain-dependent material transport in TiO2, which brings
about substrate texture-dependent conversion time scales of the anodic
TiO2 at a given temperature, may be responsible for the
substrate grain-dependent chemical compositions of TiOC650 and TiOC750. When oxygen and carbon start to diffuse
into the Ti substrate, the grain-dependent orientation of the hexagonal
Ti lattice (c/a = 1.58) is likely
to determine the diffusion kinetics40,41 and therewith
not only the fractions of C and O that remain in the TiOxCy phase adjacent to
the Ti substrate but also the thickness of the TiOxCy layer. In addition, the substrate
grain boundaries can affect the conversion of the anodic TiO2. From the
chemical maps of TiOC750 (Figure 2b), a different conversion behavior of the
anodic film at the boundaries compared to that in the area within
the substrate grains can be inferred, suggesting a lower reactivity
and/or faster carbon diffusion at the substrate grain boundaries.
At 850 °C, substrate grain growth becomes important as well,
generating fresh grain boundaries in the oxide film, which can facilitate
diffusion of carbon into the bulk.

3.3 Surface
Re-Oxidation of TiOxCy
Besides the temperature-
and grain-dependent conversion of TiO2 to TiOxCy, the final composition
of TiOC is affected by the subsequent re-oxidation of the TiC, TiO,
and TiOx species near the surface to TiO2 and
graphitic carbon, due to their relative thermodynamic instability
at room temperature and in the presence of oxygen.5 Re-oxidation was reported to happen during exposure of
TiOxCy-rich
films to ambient air and even during cooling down in reducing atmosphere
at the end of a carbothermal treatment, when the temperature dropped
below a certain threshold value.5 As the
intrinsic inertness toward re-oxidation depends on the chemical composition
of TiOC (in particular, on the stoichiometry of the TiOxCy phase),5 a substrate grain effect on the re-oxidation
rate can be expected for TiOC650 and TiOC750. In the case of TiOC850, for which local variations in
chemical composition that cannot be related to initial substrate grain
orientations are observed, the intrinsic inertness is likely to vary
accordingly on areas of different compositions. A high amount of graphitic
carbon on the surface of TiOC after carburization could retard the
re-oxidation process, as carbon doping or carbon coating of TiO2 is known to suppress the crystalline phase transformations
of TiO2 and reduce TiO2 crystallite growth,42,43 both of which are processes that require atomic re-organization,
as does re-oxidation. This provides a possible explanation for the
observation that there is less TiO2 on TiOC650 and TiOC750 than that on TiOC850. Furthermore,
the inverse trend of carbon and TiO2 at the surfaces of
TiOC650 and TiOC750 on top of ∼Ti(0001)
and ∼Ti{101̅0} may be partially ascribed to the possible
retardation of TiOxCy re-oxidation on those substrate grains on which TiOC contains
a high fraction of carbon. Therefore, not only the TiO2 conversion time scale but also the TiOC re-oxidation time scale
is effectively determined by the substrate texture. Independent of
the substrate texture, the surface oxide of TiOC550 is
almost stoichiometric within the depth that can be analyzed with SPEM
so that no substrate grain-dependent intrinsic stability can be deduced
here. It is noteworthy that the substrate grain-dependent fraction
of TiO2 observed with SPEM on TiOC550 is a consequence
of the substrate grain-dependent thickness of the carbon layer, which
attenuates photoelectrons from the covered TiO2.7

4 Conclusions
The
presented results on the annealing temperature and substrate
grain-dependent conversion of compact anodic TiO2 on Tipoly to TiOC reveal that both annealing temperature and substrate
texture majorly influence this process. By means of a spectromicroscopic
multimodal approach, employing EBSD, SEM, SPEM, and micro-Raman spectroscopy,
it was found that the anodic films on top of differently oriented
substrate grains have individual conversion and re-oxidation time
scales. A combination of temperature- and substrate grain-dependent
processes, such as crystallization, reactive carbon deposition, conversion
to TiOxCy,
and re-oxidation of the surface, plays a major role in the definition
of the heterogeneous physicochemical properties of TiOC films. A deep
understanding of such an interplay constitutes an essential point
toward the development of novel transition metal oxycarbide-based
synergistic supports for use in (electro)catalytic systems with improved
performance. On the basis of the present findings, the spatially selective
degradation of Pt/TiOC750/Tipoly during ethanol
electro-oxidation15 can be ascribed to
the substrate grain-dependent chemical composition of TiOC750, which determines the overall chemical stability of the catalytic
system in concentrated phosphoric acid at elevated temperatures.

5 Experimental Section
5.1 Sample Preparation
Disks of 1 mm
thickness and 10–15 mm diameter were cut from a 20 mm diameter
Tipoly rod (99.6% purity, temper annealed; Advent Ltd.,
England). One side of the disks was mechanically and electrochemically
polished, following the procedure described in refs (7) and14. The areas of investigation
were marked with a cross-scratch on the samples using a tungsten needle.
The electropolished Ti disks were thoroughly cleaned in an ultrasonic
bath with ethanol (technical grade), isopropanol (high purity), and
deionized (DI) water (Millipore-Milli-Q system, 18.2 MΩ).

Compact amorphous, ∼53 nm thick7 TiO2 films were produced by potentiostatic electrochemical
anodization in a home-built Teflon electrochemical cell with a two-electrode
configuration using a DC power supply controlled by a multimeter.
Anodization was carried out at 20 V for 600 s in 0.1 M sulfuric
acid (H2SO4, suprapure, 96%; Merck, Germany)
electrolyte at room temperature with a platinum mesh counter electrode.14 The anodic films were rinsed with DI water and
dried in an argon (Ar 4.8; Linde, Germany) stream.

Carbothermal
treatment was conducted in a tubular quartz reactor
under controlled gas flow. For carburization, the following procedure
was applied: (i) purging for 2 h with a high flow of Ar to remove
air, (ii) heating at a constant rate to T = 550,
650, 750, or 850 °C in 200 standard cubic centimeters per minute
(sccm) Ar, (iii) dwelling for 60 min at T, (iv) addition
of 0.5 flow % of acetylene (C2H2, solvent-free;
Linde, Germany) for 5 min, (v) dwelling for 60 min at T in Ar, (vi) cooling to room temperature. The carburized anodic films
are termed TiOCT throughout the text,
where T represents the annealing temperatures 550,
650, 750, and 850 °C.

5.2 EBSD and SEM
The
crystallographic
orientation of the electropolished Ti substrate was mapped by EBSD
using a FEI XL30 scanning electron microscope operated at a 20 kV
accelerating voltage and equipped with a TSL-EDAX EBSD system. The
step size of the EBSD map was set to 2 μm, which led to a suitable
spatial resolution of the microstructure. The surface morphology of
carburized TiO2 was investigated with a field-emission
SEM based on a Gemini column in a Zeiss CrossBeam NVision 40 system.
Micrographs were taken with the in-lens secondary electron detector,
using an acceleration voltage of 4 kV and working distances of 4–7
mm.

5.3 Micro-Raman Spectroscopy
Micro-Raman
spectroscopy was used to investigate the crystalline phase composition
of the carbothermally treated films. A dispersive Renishaw Raman Microscope
(Type 1000) equipped with a CCD detector, a Leica DM LM microscope,
and a multiline argon-ion gas laser (Stellar-Pro Select 150 of MODU-Laser)
set at 514 nm were used to analyze the chemistry and structure of
the films. The laser was unpolarized, the size of the focused laser
spot on the sample was about 5 μm (using the 50× magnification
of the optical microscope), and the excitation energy of the laser
was set to ≤20 mW, which was low enough to avoid chemical modifications
or sample damage during the selected exposure times. Backscattered
Raman signals were recorded with a resolution of about 1 cm–1 from 2000 to 146 cm–1 (lower wavenumbers
were cut off by the notch filter), with an acquisition time of 1 ×
50 s, and from 800 to 146 cm–1, with an acquisition
time of 2 × 100 s. For baseline correction (background fluorescence),
a fourth-order polynomial function was subtracted from the raw data
of the extended spectra and the small-range spectra were only shifted
to a common background level.

5.4 SPEM
SPEM was performed at the ESCAmicroscopy
beamline at the Elettra Synchrotron Facility in Trieste, where the
X-ray photon beam was demagnified by a Zone Plate to a submicron spot
of about 150 nm onto the sample, which was then rastered to produce
an image by detecting the photoelectrons generated from the sample.44 In this work, the photon energy was set to 756
eV. The incident X-ray beam was normal to the sample surface, whereas
angle θ between the hemispherical electron analyzer (HEA) and
the sample surface was 30°, providing high surface sensitivity.
Photoelectron maps of 50 × 50 μm2 were recorded
by sampling the surface with a step of 0.2 μm and a dwell time
of 60 ms per pixel. The HEA was equipped with a multichannel electron
detector, which simultaneously acquires 48 maps (channels), each tuned
at a specific photoelectron energy within a selected energy window.
This allowed to (i) extract XP spectra from selected areas of the
acquired photoelectron micrograph, with an energy window of 7.8 eV
and a step of 0.164 eV and (ii) to remove the topographic contributions
to the photoelectron micrographs and extract the chemical contrast.
The chemical contrast micrographs
(chemical maps) were obtained by choosing two sets of maps from the
recorded 48 maps that were acquired either in the energy range of
a photoelectron peak or in the energy range of the background signal,
integrating them to obtain two effective maps corresponding to the
photoelectron signal in the two spectral ranges and obtaining their
ratio.45 In that way, peak over background
(C/BG, TiO2/BG) or peak A over peak B (TiC/TiO2, TiOx/TiO2) chemical maps
were obtained from the photoelectron maps acquired in the spectral
regions of the C 1s and Ti 2p3/2 core levels.
