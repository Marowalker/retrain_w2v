UiO-66-NH2, a zirconium-based functional metal–organic
framework (MOF), was postsynthetically modified via Schiff base reaction
between aldehyde groups in glutaraldehyde and amino groups in UiO-66-NH2 and CO2-preabsorbed polyethyleneimine (PEI). The
resulting PEI-modified MOFs, abbreviated as PEIC@UiO, were
characterized with 1H NMR, Fourier transform infrared,
powder X-ray diffraction, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller, scanning
electron microscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis and evaluated
as CO2 adsorbents. In comparison with pristine UiO-66-NH2, the PEIC@UiO adsorbents have reduced specific
surface area (7–150 m2/g) but maintained the same
crystal structure. Particularly, the PEIC96@UiO adsorbent
exhibited significantly improved CO2/N2 adsorption
selectivity (48 vs 25) and higher CO2 adsorption capacity
(3.2 vs 2.7 mmol/g). The adsorbent also displayed moderate desorption
energy (68 kJ/mol CO2), superior moisture endurance, and
recyclability, which are very desirable for practical applications.

1 Introduction
To
control the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2)
in the air, carbon capture, utilization, and storage have received
extensive attention in recent years.1−3 Currently, the chemical
absorption using aqueous organic amines like monoethanolamine as absorbent
is the most important method for CO2 capture from industrial
waste gases.4−6 However, some inherent drawbacks such as degradation
or volatilization of organic amines, equipment corrosion, and high
energy consumption limit its practical application. Therefore, various
kinds of solid porous adsorbents have been proposed for CO2 capture.

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are three-dimensional
porous
crystalline materials made up of metal ions or clusters coordinated
to organic linkers.7−10 As a new type of promising adsorbent materials,11,12 MOFs have shown enormous potential for CO2 capture due
to large specific surface area, high crystallinity, tunable chemical
structure, and pore properties.8 However,
it remains a challenge to design MOFs with quite high selectivity
as well as CO2 adsorption capacity because most MOFs do
not possess high CO2 adsorption selectivity. Therefore,
much research has been done to improve the CO2 adsorption
selectivity of MOFs, including incorporation of open metal sites,13 construction of size/shape with specific pores,14 ligand functionalization to introduce strongly
polar functional groups,15 and amine grafting.16

As a zirconium(IV)-based MOF, UiO-66 has
attracted great interest
because of its superior thermal and chemical stability.17 By functionalizing the ligand of UiO-66 with
polar groups such as −NH2, −Br, −NO2, −(CF3)2, −SO3H, and −CO2H,18−20 the CO2 adsorption
selectivity was improved while retaining the stability, especially
when amino group was used as the functional group.20 Cmarik et al. reported that UiO-66-NH2 showed
enhanced CO2 adsorption capacity (2.98 vs 1.75 mmol/g)
and adsorption selectivity over N2 (13.2 vs 12.5) at 298
K and 1 bar20 when compared with UiO-66.
The selectivity obtained by applying ideal adsorption solution theory
(IAST) for a 15:85 CO2/N2 gas mixture was 52.20 Higher CO2 adsorption capacity (3,21 3.522 mmol/g) and
CO2/N2 selectivity (3121) of UiO-66-NH2 were reported by Molavi et al.21 and Huang et al.22 Improvement of CO2 capture performance of UiO-66 by polyethyleneimine
(PEI) impregnation23 or ethanolamine grafting24 was also reported.

For UiO-66-NH2, postsynthetic modification can further
improve the CO2 capture performance.21,25,26 Molavi et al. modified UiO-66-NH2 with glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) by epoxy-amino reaction, resulting
in improvement in CO2 adsorption capacity from 3.0 to 4.3
mmol/g and CO2/N2 selectivity from 31 to 46.21 The resulting GMA-UiO-66 was further functionalized
with ethylenediamine through aza-Michael addition reaction to improve
CO2 adsorption capacity up to 5.0 mmol/g.25 Piperazine-grafted UiO-66-NH2 was reported to
have IAST selectivity up to 19 for a 15:85 CO2/CH4 gas mixture at 298 K at the expense of lower CO2 adsorption
capacity.26 Interaction between amines
with the open metal sites of MOFs has also been reported to improve
CO2 adsorption capacity of MOFs at low pressure and room
temperature, such as N,N′-dimethylethylenediamine
(mmen)/[Mg2(dobpdc)],27 ethylenediamine/ZIF-8,28 tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA)/MIL-101-NH2,29 polyethyleneimine (PEI)/MIL-101,30,31 PEI/MIL-101-NH2,3232 and PEI/HKUST33 composites.
In all these amine-modified MOFs, the MOFs act as supports with large
specific surface area and the amine groups adsorb CO2.
The synergism between them results in enhancement of the CO2 adsorption capacity and selectivity. PEI is a suitable polyamine
with highly dense amine groups, especially accessible primary amine
sites at chain ends, which can react with CO2 by forming
carbamates.34 But as a viscous liquid,
PEI itself is not a suitable candidate for CO2 adsorption.
Therefore, PEI is usually supported onto porous materials such as
zeolites,35 microporous/mesoporous silica,36 and porous polymers37 as well as MOFs23,30−33 to improve their CO2 sorption. Because of the higher porosity and specific surface area,
MOFs seems to be more suitable for PEI incorporation to reach high
CO2 adsorption capacity.

In this work, we report
PEI-modified UiO-66-NH2 in an
attempt to prepare CO2 adsorbent with high adsorption capacity,
kinetics, and selectivity. UiO-66-NH2 was postsynthetically
modified with PEI in the presence of glutaraldehyde (GD) via Schiff
base reaction. The adsorbents were characterized with 1H NMR, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), powder X-ray diffraction
(PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA). CO2 adsorption was tested under different
conditions to evaluate the adsorbents for potential application in
CO2 capture from flue gas.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Structural
Characterization
Powdery UiO-66-NH2 was prepared
according to a previously
reported procedure and then postsynthetically modified with PEI in
the presence of GD, which linked UiO-66-NH2 and PEI together
through Schiff base reaction, as illustrated in Scheme 1. He et al.42 reported
that a CO2-imprinted solid amine adsorbent prepared by
cross-linking CO2-preabsorbed PEI with glutaraldehyde showed
a 25% higher CO2 adsorption capacity. In this study, CO2-preabsorbed PEI was also used in the postsynthetic modification
to prepare three adsorbents named as PEIC@UiOx, in which x (48, 72, and 96%) means mass percentage
of PEI based on UiO-66-NH2. For comparison, PEI72@UiO was
prepared using PEI without CO2 preabsorption and PEI96+UiO was prepared by impregnation of
PEI in the absence of glutaraldehyde. Detailed preparation conditions
and structural characteristics of the adsorbents are summarized in Table 1. The PEI content
in the adsorbent (PEIexp) was calculated by the following
formula  where W is
the weight gain based on the unit mass of UiO-66-NH2, N is the nitrogen content of the adsorbent measured by elemental
analysis, and N(PEI) is the theoretical nitrogen
content (30.74 wt %) of PEI. For the three PEIC@UiO samples,
PEI content (10.6–22.4 wt %) increased with increasing PEI
feeding (48–96 wt %) while the color changes from yellow to
grayish brown. The weight gain is less than the PEI feeding for all
the samples. It seems to be independent of CO2 preabsorbing
PEI (PEIC72@UiO vs PEI72@UiO) or the presence of glutaraldehyde
(PEIC96@UiO vs PEI96+UiO). But, the nitrogen content of
PEI96+UiO is clearly higher than that of PEIC96@UiO because
both PEI and nitrogen-free glutaraldehyde are gained in PEIC96@UiO but only PEI is gained in PEI96+UiO. From these results, it
is concluded that only partial PEI has been incorporated onto the
surface of the MOF, especially in the chemically modified PEI@UiO
and PEIC@UiO series. The incomplete chemical grafting of
PEI may be attributed to the steric hindrance imposed by partial pendant
−NH2 groups, which point to the MOF cavities other
than those outside.38 In other words, these
−NH2 groups in the MOF did not contribute to graft
PEI. Another possibility is that partial glutaraldehyde reacted with
the MOF or PEI itself, resulting in intra-cross-linking of MOF or
PEI instead of PEI grafting onto the MOF.

Figure 1 shows the 1H NMR spectra of PEI-modified
and PEI-impregnated UiO-66-NH2 adsorbents after digestion
in NaOH/D2O solution
as well as PEI itself. In UiO-66-NH2, as expected, the
three proton signals of 7.02, 7.09, and 7.53 ppm are attributed to
the benzene ring structure (3 × 1H) of organic ligand in MOFs.
The peak at 2.07 ppm is attributed to Zr–OH43 formed during digestion. The reason of the peak at 8.27
ppm is not clear yet. It also exists in the spectrum of digested UiO-66-NH2 reported previously.44 After PEI
modification, the multiple broad proton signals of −CH2 in PEI and glutaraldehyde appeared at 2.3–2.6 ppm.
The peak intensity shows an increasing trend while the PEI loading
increased. However, −N=CH bond formatted by Schiff base
reaction of glutaraldehyde was not observed in PEI@UiO & PEIC@UiO. It was possible that −N=CH bonds were
unstable under alkaline conditions and ruptured.

Figure 1 1H NMR spectra
of PEI, UiO-66-NH2, and PEI-modified
MOFs. The samples except PEI were digested for 24 h in a 1 M solution
of NaOH/D2O before NMR measurement.

The FTIR spectra shown in Figure 2 provided more information for the products.
For UiO-66-NH2, a strong peak at 1658 cm–1, assigned to
the v(C=O) stretching of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) can be seen. The absence
of this band in PEIC@UiO-66 indicates the complete exchange
of DMF with water.45 The 3000–2800
and 3600–3100 cm–1 signals are assigned to
the stretching vibration of CH2 and unreacted amino groups,
respectively. They became stronger when more PEI was incorporated.
The characteristic stretching vibration peaks of NH2 on
the MOF appeared at 1436 and 1258 cm–1. The two
peaks were weakened because of its Schiff base reaction with aldehyde
group in glutaraldehyde to form N=C bond at 1618 cm–1 (stretching vibration), resulting PEI grafting shown in Scheme 1. In addition to
the grafting reaction, the intra-cross-linking reactions of PEI and
UiO-66-NH2 with glutaraldehyde also occurred unavoidably
at the same time. In fact, all these Schiff base reactions contributed
to the signal at 1618 cm–1, but could not be identified
from each other in the FTIR results. For simplicity and clarity, Scheme 1 only shows the expected
grafting structure of the products.

Figure 2 FTIR spectra of PEI, UiO-66-NH2, and PEI-modified MOFs.

The PXRD patterns of UiO-66-NH2 and the five PEI-modified
adsorbents are shown in Figure 3. The as-synthesized UiO-66-NH2 showed narrow diffraction
peaks in accordance with previously published data,17,38 confirming successful synthesis and high crystallinity of UiO-66-NH2. The PXRD patterns of PEI-modified MOFs were essentially
identical to that for the parent UiO-66-NH2, indicating
that the crystal structure of UiO-66-NH2 was well maintained
after the modification. The peak intensity of UiO-66-NH2 decreased after PEI modification because of the decrease of MOF
content and the enhancement of the interaction between the PEI amino
groups and the UiO-66-NH2 Zr sites.23 Another reason that cannot be completely excluded is that
the MOF framework structure could be destroyed to some extent in alkali
amine solution though UiO-66-NH2 is reported to show excellent
alkali resistance.38 Similar structure
destruction were reported in some amine-impregnated MOFs, such as
MIL-101,31 HKUST-1,33 and MOF-74.46

(PXRD) patterns of pristine UiO-66-NH2 and PEI-modified
adsorbents.

The nitrogen adsorption
isotherms of the five PEI-modified adsorbents
and UiO-66-NH2 are shown in Figure S1. The specific surface areas calculated from N2 adsorption isotherms are listed in Table 1. It reaches 987 m2/g for UiO-66-NH2 but decreases to 151, 12.0, and 7.6 m2/g for PEIC48@UiO, PEIC72@UiO, and PEIC96@UiO,
respectively. At the same time, the average pore size gradually increases
and the pore volume decreases with increasing PEI loading. The results
suggested that PEI modification remarkably decreased the specific
surface area of UiO-66-NH2 due to the pore-filling effect
of PEI on the macropores between MOF particles. Whether or not pretreating
PEI with CO2 preabsorption did not show clear influence
on the pore characteristics (PEIC72@UiO vs PEI72@UiO),
but impregnation of UiO-66-NH2 with large amount of PEI
(PEI96+UiO) led to serious pore blockage (supported by SEM observation,
see next paragraph), making the micropores in MOF crystals no longer
accessible for N2 adsorption. Therefore, PEI96+UiO only
maintained a very small surface area of 1.40 m2/g.

To further understand the effect of PEI modification on the pore
characteristic, the morphological structure of the samples was further
observed by SEM. As shown in Figure 4, the UiO-66-NH2 appears to be near-spherical
crystals. For PEI@UiO or PEIC@UiO series, the morphology
of MOF particles did not show an observable change though there might
exist PEI in the intercrystal void of UiO-66-NH2. But for
PEI96+UiO, the surface and intercrystal void of UiO-66-NH2 crystals are almost fully occupied by PEI. In other words, the UiO-66-NH2 crystals are embedded in the PEI layers. This phenomenon
explains why the specific surface area of PEI96+UiO was very low.

Figure 4 SEM images
of pristine UiO-66-NH2 and PEI-modified adsorbents.

CO2 adsorbents must
have enough thermal stability to
endure high temperature of at least 100–150 °C of flue
gas.47 The TGA curves of UiO-66-NH2 and the five PEI-modified adsorbents are shown in Figure 5. The TGA curves
of UiO-66-NH2 showed a two-step weight loss. The initial
weight loss at 100–280 °C was ascribed to the removal
of adsorbed gas and dehydroxylating of the zirconium oxoclusters.38 The second-step weight loss (after 280 °C)
was due to the framework decomposition.38 The PEI-modified adsorbents were all stable up to 200 °C, if
we ignore the initial weight loss over 100 °C, which possibly
results from absorbed water and gases. At temperature higher than
200 °C, the weight loss was caused mainly by PEI decomposition.
With the increase of PEI loading, the weight loss curve moves toward
low temperature side. The differences in preparation methods do not
show a clear influence on thermal stability. In conclusion, the PEI-modified
adsorbents have good thermal stability to endure normal flue gas temperature
for CO2 separation.

2.2 CO2 Adsorption
Capacity, Rate,
and Selectivity over N2
CO2 adsorption
performance of UiO-66-NH2 and the five PEI-modified adsorbents
at 25 °C and 1 atm is shown in Figure 6A. The saturated adsorption capacity of UiO-66-NH2 reaches up to 2.67 mmol CO2/g. It is roughly in
accordance with some of the reported values (2.86–3.15 mmol
CO2/g).21 In comparison, the
PEIC@UiO adsorbents exhibit higher adsorption capacity
ranging from 2.75 to 3.26 mmol CO2/g (Table 2). The NH2 groups
in PEI and UiO-66-NH2 contributed to chemical CO2 adsorption, and the pores in UiO-66-NH2 contributed to
physical CO2 adsorption. However, partial NH2 groups in UiO-66-NH2 that had converted to N=C
bonds no longer contributed to CO2 adsorption and offset
part of the contribution of PEI to CO2 adsorption. The
amount of incorporated PEI is not positively correlated with the CO2 adsorption capacity. Among them, PEIC72@UiO shows
the highest adsorption capacity, 3.26 mmol CO2/g. In comparison
with PEI72@UiO, PEIC72@UiO shows 9% higher CO2 adsorption capacity (3.26 vs 2.99 mmol CO2/g). The increment
is higher than the experimental error (<3%) but not as high as
the value (25%) reported previously.42 The
saturated adsorption capacity of PEI96+UiO is much lower than that
of PEIC96@UiO (1.87 vs 3.15 mmol CO2/g) because
of its much lower specific surface area.

Furthermore, it can
be seen that all the PEI@UiO adsorbents exhibit
high adsorption rate, reaching saturated adsorption capacity in 15
min. However, PEI96+UiO need much longer time to reach CO2 saturation due to low specific surface area and consequent slower
adsorption rate.

CO2/N2 adsorption selectivity
is another
important indicator to evaluate a solid sorbent for practical use.
For this purpose, the adsorption of pure N2 (60 mL/min)
was conducted under the same condition. The results are shown in Figure 6B and listed in Table 2. UiO-66-NH2 adsorbed N2 significantly (0.11 mmol/g). But, the PEIC@UiO adsorbents had a relatively small amount of N2 adsorption, decreasing to 0.06–0.09 mmol/g. The separation
factor α (adsorption selectivity of CO2 over N2) was calculated by the formula  where Qi and Pi (Pi = 1 bar here)
are the adsorption capacity and the partial pressure of component i, respectively. The separation factor of UiO-66-NH2 is 25.5, which is between the reported values in literature
(1320–3221). After PEI modification, the value of PEIC@UiO increased
to 30.9–48.0. As expected, it was obviously improved with increasing
PEI loading.

To simulate flue gas that usually contains about
15 vol % CO2, a CO2/N2 mixture gas
(10 + 60 mL/min,
CO2 14.3 vol %) was also used for CO2 adsorption.
The result is shown in Figure 7. The saturated gas adsorption capacity of PEIC@UiO was 2.06–2.38 mmol CO2 + N2/g.
The true CO2 sorption capacity from the mixed gas (Cs,0.15bar) can be calibrated by the following
formula. The adsorption rate and capacity for simulated flue gas both
decreased to some extent in comparison with those for pure CO248 due to lower CO2 partial
pressure. Among them, PEIC96@UiO reaches the highest adsorption
capacity (2.33 mmol CO2/g).  The PEIC96@UiO
is compared with
some other CO2 adsorbents reported in literature. As shown
in Table 3, it can
be seen that this functional MOF adsorbent shows a reasonably good
CO2 adsorption performance, especially in CO2 selectivity.

2.3 CO2 Desorption Enthalpy
Differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) was used to determine the
CO2 desorption heat (Qdes).
As shown in Figure 8, a strong endotherm (155–191 J/g CO2-saturated
adsorbent) was observed for all the three CO2-saturated
PEIC@UiO adsorbents due to CO2 desorption but
none for the neat PEIC96@UiO. The CO2 desorption
occurred in a wide temperature range from 70 to 230 °C, and the
endotherm peak temperature appears at 133–144 °C. From
the desorption enthalpy value, the desorption heat Qdes (kJ/mol CO2) of CO2-saturated
PEIC@UiO can be calculated by the equation Qdes = E/(Cs/(CsMCO2/1000 + 1)), where E, Cs, MCO2 are the desorption
enthalpy (J/g), the CO2 adsorption capacity (mmol/g), and
the molar mass of CO2 (44 g/mol), respectively. The value
ranges from 63.3 to 68.0 kJ/mol CO2, higher than that of
pristine UiO-66-NH2 (ca. 27 kJ/mol).20 The more PEI is incorporated, the higher the CO2 desorption heat is. The values are located in the range of 60–90
kJ/mol of typical chemsorption47 but lower
than the typical value, ca. 80 kJ/mol, of alkanolamine aqueous solution.52,53 Therefore, this CO2 adsorbent seems competitive in reducing
the regeneration energy consumption.

and three CO2-saturated PEIC@UiO adsorbents.

2.4 Effect
of Moisture on CO2 Adsorption
Moisture is a non-negligible
factor that affects practical CO2 capture from flue gas,
which usually contains 8–17%
water vapor.54 Due to the hydrophilicity,
the adsorbents unavoidably adsorb water vapor from the flue gas. To
determine the water content in adsorbents during CO2 capture,
the water adsorption of PEIC96@UiO at 25 °C was measured.
This hygroscopic adsorbent adsorbed 1.7 wt % water in 15 min. To study
the influence of moisture on CO2 adsorption, dry CO2 (d-CO2) and moist CO2 (m-CO2) were used to pass through dry adsorbent (d-Sorb) separately. The
moist CO2 gas was obtained by feeding dry CO2 gas through water. The results are shown in Figure 9.

Figure 9 CO2 adsorption of pristine UiO-66-NH2 and
PEI-modified adsorbents using dry or moist CO2 gas (solid:
d-CO2; hollow: m-CO2).

As hygroscopic adsorbents, UiO-66-NH2 showed a
20.2%
decrease in CO2 adsorption capacity in the “m-CO2 + d-Sorb” case because water vapor adsorption competed
with CO2 adsorption. The existence of water could also
affect the CO2 binding to the open metal sites in MOF.55 The adsorption capacity of PEIC48@UiO
slightly decreased by 2.2%, which was within the allowable error range
of the adsorption experiment. However, CO2 adsorption capacity
of PEIC72@UiO, PEIC96@UiO, and PEI96+UiO increased
in the m-CO2 + d-Sorb case by 5.2, 5.7, and 43.8%, respectively.
The rise instead of descent in CO2 adsorption is attributed
to the tertiary amino groups in PEI (about 12 wt %), which might contribute
to CO2 adsorption in the presence of moisture.56 Therefore, the PEIC@UiO adsorbents
show excellent moisture endurance in CO2 adsorption.

2.5 Adsorption/Desorption Cycles
Finally,
CO2 adsorption/desorption cycles of PEIC96@UiO
were conducted to assess the recyclability and durability of the adsorbent.
The CO2 desorption was carried out at 120 °C. The
same temperature was also used for the CO2 desorption of
aqueous monoethanolamine absorbent.52 Pure
N2 purging was used instead of vacuum to facilitate the
desorption experiment, though the latter seemed more suitable for
practical CO2 capture. Figure 10 shows three cycles of CO2 adsorption/desorption
of PEIC96@UiO. Because of weak chemical bonding between
PEIC96@UiO and CO2 at high temperature, the
adsorbed CO2 was desorbed rapidly and nearly completely.
In each cycle, the adsorbent effectively captured 3.0 mmol CO2/g. A high adsorption capacity, 97.4%, was retained after
three cycles. The preadsorded moisture and N2 might account
for the slight loss in adsorption capacity. In conclusion, PEIC96@UiO, showed quite steady CO2 adsorption and
superior durability.

Figure 10 CO2 adsorption/desorption cycles of PEIC96@UiO.

3 Conclusions
UiO-66-NH2, a zirconium-based functional metal–organic
framework (MOF), was postsynthetically modified with CO2-preabsorbed polyethyleneimine (PEI) via Schiff base reaction. The
resulting PEIC@UiO adsorbents contain PEI up to 22.1 wt
% or nitrogen up to 9.5 wt %. They show specific surface area of 7–150
m2/g and maintain unchanged crystal structure of the MOF.
When compared with pristine UiO-66-NH2, PEIC96@UiO shows significantly improved CO2/N2 adsorption
selectivity (48 vs 25) and higher CO2 adsorption capacity
(3.2 vs 2.7 mmol/g), but retains fast CO2 adsorption/desorption
in spite of its reduced specific surface area. It also displays moderate
desorption heat (68 kJ/mol CO2), superior moisture endurance,
and recyclability, which are very desirable for practical applications.
Further studies on raising PEI content as well as maintaining high
specific surface will be reported elsewhere.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
Zirconium tetrachloride
(ZrCl4, 98%), branched polyethyleneimine (PEI, 99%, Mw = 600, viscous liquid, theoretical amino group
content 32.9 wt %, primary amino group content 12.8 wt %), and glutaraldehyde
(GD, 50%) were purchased from Aladdin Chemical Co. Ltd. China. 2-Aminobenzene-1,4-dicarboxylic
acid (ABDC or H2BDC-NH2, 98%) was supplied by
J&K Chemicals. N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF), anhydrous ethanol, anhydrous methanol, sodium hydroxide (NaOH),
and hydrochloric acid (HCl, 36.5%) were all analytical grade reagents
purchased from Sinopharm Chem. Reagent Co. Ltd. China. All chemicals
were used as received. Nitrogen (N2, ≥99.5%) and
carbon dioxide (CO2, ≥99.995%) were obtained from
Jingong Specialty Gases Co., Ltd. China.

4.2 Synthesis
of UiO-66-NH2
[Zr6O4(OH)4(BDC-NH2)6] (UiO-66-NH2)
was prepared according to a procedure
previously reported,20,38 with some modifications. In brief,
ZrCl4 (5 mmol, 1.166 g), DMF (15 mL), and HCl (5 mL) were
mixed and sonicated for 20 min until all materials were dissolved
fully at room temperature. ABDC (5 mmol, 0.9057 g) and the residual
DMF (35 mL) were then added and the mixture was sonicated for another
20 min. The homogeneous mixture was heated at 80 °C for 12 h
and then at 100 °C for 24 h. The resulting product precipitated
as microcrystalline powder. The mixture was cooled down to room temperature
and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min to separate the solid from
the solution. After washing three times with DMF (30 mL) and ethanol
(30 mL), respectively, and drying under vacuum at 100 °C for
24 h, yellow powder was finally obtained at a yield of 92%.

4.3 Synthesis of PEI-Modified UiO-66-NH2 Adsorbent (PEIC@UiO and PEI@UiO)
Scheme 1 depicts the preparation process.
PEI (0.375, 0.563, or 0.751 g) was dissolved in water (10.0 mL). CO2 was fed into the resulting solution at room temperature to
prepare CO2-preabsorbed PEI. After 2 h, UiO-66-NH2 (0.5 mmol, 0.78 g) was added. After stirring at 400 rpm for 30 min,
an aqueous solution of GD (0.6007 g) was added dropwise under stirring
at room temperature for another 12 h. The resulting solid was isolated
via centrifugation and washed with deionized water three times. After
vacuum drying at 100 °C for 24 h to remove absorbed CO2 and solvent, a blocky solid product was obtained. It was symbolized
as “PEICx@UiO”, where UiO and superscript
C represented UiO-66-NH2 and preabsorption of CO2, x was the mass percentage of PEI fed based on UiO-66-NH2. An adsorbent was also prepared without CO2 preabsorption.
In this case, the product was named as “PEIx@UiO”. The
details of preparation conditions and structural characteristics of
the adsorbents are listed in Table 1.

4.4 Preparation of PEI-Impregnated
UiO-66-NH2 Adsorbent (PEI + UiO)
A PEI-impregnated
UiO-66-NH2 adsorbent was also prepared using an impregnation
method
according to the procedure previously reported for PEI-impregnated
UiO-66 adsorbent.23 PEI (1.5 mmol, 0.716
g) was dissolved in 5 mL anhydrous methanol. UiO-66-NH2 (0.5 mmol, 0.78 g) powder was added into the solution and the mixture
was treated under ultrasonication for 1 h. Then, it was dried under
nitrogen atmosphere at 40 °C for 6 h and further dried under
vacuum at 100 °C for 12 h. Finally, the obtained sample was symbolized
as PEI96+UiO, where UiO represented UiO-66-NH2 and 96 was
the mass percentage of PEI fed based on UiO-66-NH2.

4.5 Characterization
The samples were
characterized by elemental analysis (Flash EA1112, ThermoFinnigan
Co.), 1H NMR (Bruker AC-80 spectroscopy, 400 MHz, NaOH/D2O solution), and FTIR (Nicolet 5700). Before 1H
NMR measurement, the PEI-modified samples (20 mg) were digested with
0.6 mL of a NaOH/D2O solution (1 M) and allowed to stand
for 24 h. After the digestion process, the organic portions of the
samples (linkers in the MOF and grafted amines) were dissolved, and
the inorganic component of the MOF was converted to zirconium hydroxide,
which was separated from the solution by filtration.38 PEI was directly measured using NaOH/D2O solution
(1 M) as the solvent. The FTIR spectra of PEI-modified samples were
recorded using KBr disk samples.

Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD)
pattern was measured using a PANalytical X’Pert X-ray diffraction
system (PANalytical Company) using Cu Kα radiation (1.54 Å),
working at 40 kV and 40 mA.

N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms were recorded
with a Quantachrome Autosorb-1-C instrument at 77 K. The specific
surface area was estimated with the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method and the pore volume was calculated with the desorption
branch of the isotherms. The samples were degassed at 100 °C
for 24 h before BET analysis.

The morphology was recorded with
a scanning electron microscope
(SEM, Utral 55, Carl zeiss, Germany) at an acceleration voltage of
1.5 kV, using the samples coated with a thin gold layer.

Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) was recorded with a Perkin-Elmer
instrument Pyris 1 TGA analyser under N2 flow (20 mL/min)
from 50 to 650 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1.

4.6 CO2 Capture
Before CO2 adsorption, about 1.0 g of adsorbent was outgassed under
vacuum at 100 °C. CO2 adsorption/desorption was performed
under atmospheric pressure, as previously reported.39,40 Desorption of the adsorbent was conducted under pure N2 (60 mL/min) at a temperature of 120 °C. Some repeated experiments
of CO2 adsorption and desorption were done. CO2 desorption heat (Qdes) was recorded
with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, Q200, TA Instrument).41 The samples were scanned at a heating rate of
10 °C/min under nitrogen flow.
