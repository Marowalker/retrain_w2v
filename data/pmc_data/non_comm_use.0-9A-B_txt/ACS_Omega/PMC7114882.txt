We
report on the design and synthesis of a green-emitting iridium complex–peptide
hybrid (IPH) 4, which has an electron-donating hydroxyacetic
acid (glycolic acid) moiety between the Ir core and the peptide part.
It was found that 4 is selectively cytotoxic against
cancer cells, and the dead cells showed a green emission. Mechanistic
studies of cell death indicate that 4 induces a paraptosis-like
cell death through the increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ concentrations
via direct Ca2+ transfer from ER to mitochondria, the loss
of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm),
and the vacuolization of cytoplasm and intracellular organelle. Although
typical paraptosis and/or autophagy markers were upregulated by 4 through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling
pathway, as confirmed by Western blot analysis, autophagy is not the
main pathway in 4-induced cell death. The degradation
of actin, which consists of a cytoskeleton, is also induced by high
concentrations of Ca2+, as evidenced by costaining experiments
using a specific probe. These results will be presented and discussed.

Introduction
Cyclometalated
iridium(III) (Ir(III)) complexes such as fac-Ir(tpy)31a (tpy = 2-(4′-tolyl)pyridine) and fac-Ir(ppy)31b (ppy = 2-phenylpyridine)
exhibit excellent photophysical properties, inducing long Stokes shifts,
high quantum yields, and long lifetimes.1−4 Therefore, these analogs have widely been
applied to organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs),1−4 photoredox catalysts,5,6 bioimaging probes,7−11 oxygen sensors,10 anticancer agents,12−17 and related areas.

We previously reported on the characteristics
of cyclometalated Ir complexes such as blue-green-red18,19 and white emitters,20 pH sensors,21−23 and anticancer agents24−28 via regioselective substitution reactions of 1a and 1b at the 5′-position (the p-position
with respect to the C–Ir bond) of tpy and ppy ligands.18 Among them, cationic amphiphilic Ir complexes 2 with net charges of +9 to +12, which contain a cationic
peptide sequence such as KKGG and KKKGG (K, lysine; G, glycine) connected
through appropriate alkyl (C6 and C8) linkers
between the Ir core and the peptide, have substantial cytotoxicity
against Jurkat cells (T-lymphocyte leukemia) (EC50 = 7–16
μM).24

We recently reported
on the design and synthesis of new iridium complex–peptide
hybrids (IPHs) 3a–d, which contain the same alkyl
linker and peptide sequence as those of 2 at the 4′-position
(the m-position with respect to the C–Ir bond)
of the ppy ligands (Chart 1).29 It was found that 3b and 3c have a more potent cytotoxicity against Jurkat
cells than that for 2c and 2d, respectively.
Jurkat cells treated with these Ir complexes undergo a morphological
change accompanied by membrane disruption, and the dead cells show
a strong green emission for 2 and a yellow emission in
the case of 3. Mechanistic studies indicate that the
cell death induced by these IPHs is related to intracellular Ca2+ signaling, possibly involving the interaction with a Ca2+–calmodulin (CaM) complex and localization on mitochondria.
However, costaining experiments with other red-emitting probes (λem = 600–700 nm) (and green-emitting
probes) were hampered by an overlap in the emission by a strong yellow
emission (λem = 500–650 nm)
of 3. Therefore, the design and synthesis of new IPHs
having the same peptide units that emit a green luminescence are needed.

Chart 1 In this context, we previously
reported that electron-donating groups at the 4′-position of
the ppy ligands in 1c stabilize the HOMO energy and increase
the highest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO)–lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) energy gap, resulting in a blue shift in
the luminescence emission.19 Typical examples
include fac-Ir(mppy)31c (mppy
= 2-(4′-methoxyphenyl)pyridine) and 1d that exhibit
a blue emission at ca. 460 and 490 nm (Chart 1).

This background prompted us to design
and synthesize a green-emitting IPH 4, which contains
a hydroxyacetic acid (glycolic acid) moiety as an electron-donating
group to connect with the H2N-KKKGG sequence at the 4′-positon
of the ppy units (Chart 1). As a reference, 5 having the same alkyl linker and
the same peptide sequence at the 5′-position of the tpy unit
was synthesized. The findings indicated that 4 has a
selective cytotoxicity against Jurkat cells (cancer cells), a process
that is accompanied by membrane disruption, and its strong green emission
was observed from the dead cells. In mechanistic studies, the dissociation
constants of the Ir complexes with CaM were determined by 27 MHz quartz
crystal microbalance (QCM) analysis. It was also found that 4 induces a paraptosis-like cell death of Jurkat cells through
the enhancement of mitochondrial concentration of Ca2+ via
direct Ca2+ transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
to mitochondria, the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), and cytoplasmic vacuolization. It also appears that the
morphological changes are due to the degradation of actin caused by
the enhancement in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, as
verified by staining experiments with 4 and the use of
a probe that is specific for actin filaments.

Results and Discussion
Design
and Synthesis of an Amphiphilic Ir Complex with a Cationic Peptide
Sequence at the 4′-Position Showing a Green Emission
The synthesis of 4 is shown in Chart 2. 2-(4′-Hydroxyphenyl)pyridine 8 was synthesized from 4-hydroxyphenylboronic acid 6 and 2-bromopyridine 7 in ethylene glycol in the presence
of Pd(OAc)2 and K3PO4, and the product
was converted to the ligand 9 by the treatment with ethyl
bromoacetate in acetone in the presence of K2CO3. After complexation of 9 with IrCl3 according
to our previously reported method18 to
give 10, the ethyl esters were subjected to hydrolysis
with aqueous NaOH and EtOH in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to afford 11. The condensation of 11 with mono-Boc-protected
1,8-octanediamine linker gave 12, and the subsequent
removal of the Boc group by the treatment with TMSCl and NaI in CH3CN afforded 13 as the HI salt. The protected
peptide prepared by Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis was coupled
with 13 to obtain the fully protected Ir complex. Finally,
the protecting groups were removed by the treatment with TMSCl and
NaI in CH3CN/MeOH (1/1), and the resulting product was
purified by reversed-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) to afford the trifluoroacetate
salt of 4. The Ir complex 5, as a reference
compound of 4, was synthesized by the condensation of 14, the preparation of which was previously reported by us,24 with the protected peptide and a successive
deprotection reaction. It should be noted that the diastereomers of 4 and 5 resulting from the racemic Ir centers
(Δ and Λ forms) were not distinguished in the 1H NMR spectra and hence were not separated.

Chart 2 Photophysical Properties
of Ir Complexes
UV–vis and luminescence emission spectra
of the Ir complex 4, 5, and 3c (10 μM) in degassed 100 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES) at pH 7.4 and 25 °C are shown in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information, and their photophysical
data are summarized in Table S1 in the
Supporting Information. The concentrations of these Ir complexes in
stock solutions (PBS: phosphate-buffered saline) were determined by
our previous method24 from the molar extinction
coefficient at 340 nm (ε340 nm = (1.91 ±
0.03) × 104 M–1 cm–1) of 10 and 12 (shown in Chart 2) that were characterized by
elemental analysis. The strong absorption bands at ca. 300 nm were
assigned to the 1π–π* transition of
the ppy ligands, and the weak shoulder bands at ca. 350–500
nm were attributed to spin-allowed singlet-to-singlet metal-to-ligand
charge transfer (1MLCT) transitions, spin-forbidden singlet-to-triplet
(3MLCT) transitions, and 3π–π*
transitions as compared that of 3c (ca. 540 nm) (Figure S1b in the Supporting Information), and
emission quantum yields (Φ) of 4 and 5 were determined to be 0.43 and 0.41, respectively. It should be
noted that the emission of 4 exhibits a considerable
blue shift (ca. 505 nm). These results are consistent with reports
that an electron-donating methoxy group on the phenylpyridine (ppy)
ligand induces a blue shift in its emission spectra.19

Density Function Theory Calculations of 10
Density function theory (DFT) calculations of 10 as representative examples of 4 and 10–13 were carried out using the Gaussian09 program,
in which the B3LYP hybrid functional was used together with the LanL2DZ
basis set for the Ir atom and the 6-31G basis set for the H, C, N,
and O atoms.30 Time-dependant DFT (TD-DFT)
calculations were carried out based on all ground-state geometries
using the same functional and basis set. As shown in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information, the HOMO shapes of 10 and 15 (Chart 3) are similar and consisted of phenyl-π and Ir-d
orbitals (Figures S2a,c in the Supporting
Information), while the LUMO is mainly localized on the pyridine ring
(Figures S2b,d in the Supporting Information).
The introduction of an electron-donating glycolic acid group at the
4′-position raises its HOMO level, resulting in a blue shift
in its emission (Table S2 in the Supporting
Information), as evidenced by Figure S1 in the Supporting Information.

Chart 3 Cytotoxicity of IPHs that
Contain a Cationic Peptide Sequence against Cancer Cells (Jurkat Cells)
and a Normal Cell Line (IMR90 Cells)
The cytotoxicities of 4 and 5 containing the cationic KKKGG peptide
sequence against Jurkat cells (T-lymphocyte leukemia) were assessed
by means of an 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay (Figure 1a). Jurkat cells (2.0 × 104 cells/mL) were
incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)/RPMI
1640 medium containing 4 or 5 (0–25
μM). The results of the MTT assay indicate that 4 had nearly the same cytotoxicity (EC50 = 1.5 μM)
as 5 (EC50 = 1.5 μM) and is slightly
more cytotoxic than 3c (EC50 = 2.4 μM).
On the other hand, 4 and 5 (0–25
μM) weakly induced cell death of IMR90 cells (human Caucasian
fetal lung fibroblast), which are used as a model of normal cells
(Figure 1b). These
results suggest that Ir complexes 4 and 5 have the capacity to selectively kill cancer cells.

Figure 1 (a) MTT assay of Jurkat
cells with 4 (closed circles), 5 (closed
diamonds), and 3c (closed squares) in 10% FBS/RPMI medium
(incubation at 37 °C for 24 h). (b) MTT assay of IMR90 cells
with 4 (closed circles) and 5 (closed diamonds)
in 10% FBS/RPMI medium (incubation at 37 °C for 24 h). The net
charge of each complex is assumed to be +12 (4 and 5) and +9 (3c).

Figure 2a–l
shows fluorescence microscopic images of Jurkat cells treated with 4, 5, and the reference compound 3c ([Ir complex] = 25 μM). Considerable morphological changes
were induced by 4, 5, and 3c, and the dead cells exhibited green emission arising from these
IPHs. The cytotoxicities of 4 and 5 against
IMR90 cells (human Caucasian fetal lung fibroblast), a normal cell
line, were also evaluated. In Figure 2p–u, morphological changes and emissions of 4 and 5 from the cells
were both negligible or weak, indicating their lower cytotoxicity
against IMR90 cells.

and scale bar (white) is 50 μm.

Measurement of Intracellular Uptake of Ir Complexes in Jurkat Cells
The intracellular uptake of IPHs 3c, 4, 5, and 2c in Jurkat cells was examined
by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). Jurkat cells
were incubated with 3c, 4, 5, and 2c (25 μM) for 1 h at 37 °C. After
treatment, the cells were washed three times with PBS and lysed by
nitric acid. Then, lysed cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C,
and the samples were analyzed on ICP-MS. Interestingly, it was found
that the intracellular uptake of 3c (6.26 ± 0.31
fmol/cell) and 4 (7.72 ± 0.68 fmol/cell) was higher
than that of 5 (0.97 ± 0.18 fmol/cell) and 2c (0.34 ± 0.04 fmol/cell), as summarized in Figure 3. We assume that
the three polycationic peptide parts of 3c and 4 are assembled in the same direction of its structure and
that the position of cationic peptide parts on the IPHs is important
for their intracellular uptake.

into Jurkat cells at 37 °C for 1 h measured by ICP-MS.

Effect of Inhibitors of Intracellular Events,
Programmed Cell Death, and a Calmodulin-Binding Molecule
In our previous paper, it was reported that the induction of cell
death by 2c is not inhibited by the broad caspase inhibitor
benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD(OMe)-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-fmk), indicating
that cell death does not involve apoptosis.24 In this study, the effects of Z-VAD-fmk, 3-chlorophenylhydrazone
(CCCP, an uncoupling reagent and an inhibitor of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake), necrostatin-1 (Nec-1, a specific RIPK-1 inhibitor
and necroptosis inhibitor), 3-methyladenine (3-MA, an inhibitor of
autophagosome formation that functions by inhibiting type III phosphatidylinositol
3-kinases (PI3K), an autophagy inhibitor), and trifluoperazine (TFP,
a CaM-binding molecule) (for the structures of these inhibitors, see Charts S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information)
on the cytotoxicities of 4 and 5 were examined
(Figure 4). Jurkat
cells were preincubated with these inhibitors31 for 30 min and then treated with 4 (25 μM) or 5 (25 μM) for 1 h. Morphological changes (and cell death)
in the Jurkat cells caused by 4 and 5 were
inhibited to a considerable extent by treatment with CCCP (40 μM),
and the extent of IPH emission was negligible (Figure 4d–f,y-aa), indicating the existence
of a relationship between the cell death and intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and/or membrane potential of mitochondria. On
the other hand, the cell death induced by 4 and 5 was negligibly inhibited by Z-VAD-fmk (Figure 4g–i), Nec-1 (Figure 4j–l), 3-MA
(Figure 4m–o),
TFP (Figure 4p–r),
and combinations thereof (Nec-1 + 3-MA) (Figure 4s–u). These results indicate that
cell death induced by IPHs does not involve apoptosis, necroptosis,
or autophagy alone.

Figure 4 Effect of Z-VAD-fmk (15 μM, an apoptosis inhibitor),
necrostatin-1 (30 μM, a necroptosis inhibitor), 3-MA (5 mM,
an autophagy inhibitor), TFP (10 μM, a CaM-binding molecule),
and CCCP (40 μM, an uncoupling reagent and an inhibitor of Ca2+ influx into mitochondria) on the cell death of Jurkat cells
induced by 4. (a, d, g, j, m, p, s, v, y) Bright field

Mitochondrial Ca2+ Spike Induced
by 4
Recently, the relationship of intracellular
Ca2+ signaling and CaM with cell survival and cell death
was well discussed.32−38 The enhancement in intracellular Ca2+ concentration was
examined by time-course fluorescent microscopy according to our previous
reports.24,25 Jurkat cells were treated with Rhod-4/AM,
a cytosolic Ca2+ indicator, or Rhod-2/AM, a mitochondrial
Ca2+ indicator, as confirmed by costaining experiments
with MitoTracker Green (Figure S3 in the
Supporting Information), whose red emission is enhanced upon complexation
with Ca2+ in cytosol and mitochondria, respectively. As
shown in Figure 5d,e,
the fluorescent intensity of Rhod-2 was enhanced in a few minutes
after the addition of 4 (50 μM) in mitochondria
rather than in cytosol (Figure 5a,b), and the morphology of Jurkat cells changed after ca.
20 min. In contrast, 13, which contains no peptide part
and shows a very weak cytotoxicity, induces negligible Ca2+ response (Figure 5c,f). These results suggest that 4 initially induces
an increase in the Ca2+ concentrations in mitochondria
rather than in cytosol at the early stages of the cell death processes.

with 4 (e) and 13 (f) (cell 1 (light green),

We checked the effect of BAPTA/AM, which is a cytosolic
Ca2+ scavenger, on the cell death induced by 4 by means of microscopic observations and MTT assays (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). Figure S4 in the Supporting Information indicates
that BAPTA/AM negligibly inhibits cell death by 4, suggesting
that mitochondrial Ca2+ spike is an important event that
induces cell death and the change in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration
is not so important.

The cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ concentrations were also checked by flow cytometric analysis
(Figure 6). Jurkat
cells were preincubated with Rhod-4/AM or Rhod-2/AM for 30 min, treated
with 4 (50 μM) for a given incubation time, and
then immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. Figure 6a,b shows the emission intensity of Rhod-4
for 0–15 and 0–60 min after the addition of 4, respectively, and Figure 6c,d shows the emission change of Rhod-2 for 0–15 and
0–60 min after the addition of 4, respectively.
The apparent increase in the emission from Rhod-2 was observed within
15 min after the addition of 4 to Jurkat cells, supporting
the observations in Figure 5.

(a, b) Rhod-4 (5 μM) or (c, d) Rhod-2 (5 μM) and then

(green) in (a) and (c), and control (black), 20 min (blue), 40 min
(light green), and 60 min (red) in (b) and (d).

Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (ΔΨm)
The mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was measured using DilC1(5) (1,1′,3,3,3′,3′-hexamethylindodicarbocyanine
iodide)39 (its structure is shown in Chart S3 in the Supporting Information), which
accumulates in mitochondria and responds to ΔΨm. In Figure 7d–g,
considerable decrease in the emission of DilC1(5) was observed in
the presence of 4 (25 μM), as compared with Figure 7b,c, indicating the
loss of ΔΨm. The decrease in ΔΨm was also observed by the treatment of CCCP, which prevents
Ca2+ influx into mitochondria and inhibits cell death induced
by 4, in the absence (h–j) or presence (k–n)
of 4 (25 μM). It has been well described that the
influx of Ca2+ into mitochondria induces the loss of ΔΨm, resulting in cell death.40,41 These results
allowed us to conclude that 4 induces the influx of Ca2+ into mitochondria and then the loss of ΔΨm, which trigger the cell death signaling pathway.

Confocal Microscopic Observations of Jurkat Cells with IPHs and Specific
Probes for Intracellular Proteins or Organelles
Our previous
reports indicated that one of the target proteins of IPHs such as 2c and 2d is the Ca2+–CaM complex,25 which controls intracellular Ca2+ concentrations
and regulates certain types of protein functions such as calmodulin
kinase, phosphorylase kinase, and related targets,42 resulting not only in cell proliferation and metabolic
homeostasis but also in processes such as apoptosis and autophagy,
leading to the death of cancer cells.32−38 It is well known that many types of programmed cell death (PCD)
are related to malfunction and/or overfunction of intracellular organelles
such as mitochondria43−47 and lysosomes.48−51 Furthermore, actin filaments provide mechanical structure and motility
to ameboid and animal cells.52

These
facts prompted us to conduct staining experiments of Jurkat cells
by treating them with an anticalmodulin (CaM) antibody (+antirabbit
IgG H&L conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594), phalloidin (a probe
for actin), MitoTracker Red (a probe for mitochondria), LysoTracker
Red (a probe for lysosome), and ER-RFP (a probe conjugated with the
red fluorescent protein (RFP) for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER))
(Figure 8). For staining
with an anti-CaM antibody, Jurkat cells were treated with 4 (10 μM) at 37 °C for 1 h and then incubated with the
anti-CaM antibody at room temperature for 2 h accompanied by the treatment
with the Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibody. For the staining
of actin, mitochondria, and lysosomes, the cells were treated with 4 for 1 h and then incubated with a phalloidin–CruzFluor
555 conjugate (at a dilution of 1/1000), MitoTracker Red (100 nM),
and LysoTracker Red (500 nM) for 1 h, sequentially. For the staining
of ER, the cells were pretreated with ER-RFP for 24 h and then incubated
with 4 for 1 h. As shown in Figure 8a–d, the overlapping of the green
emission of 4 and the red emission of anti-CaM antibody
was negligible. This point will be discussed later.

(t), and (x). Exposure time was 20 μs/pixel. Scale bar (black)
is 10 μm.

Although actin constructs
cytoskeletons in the cells in the absence of 4 (Figure 8e–g), this
network underwent degradation after the treatment with 4, and the green emission of 4 and the red emission of
phalloidin were overlapped to a considerable extent (Figure 8h–k). The green emission
of 4 and the red emission of MitoTracker Red were also
considerably overlapped (Figure 8l–r). On the other hand, the red emission of
LysoTracker Red and ER-RFP was decreased by the treatment with 4 (Figure 8s–y,z–af), indicating the degradation of lysosome and
ER by 4. These results suggest that 4 interacts
with actin filaments and mitochondria and induces lysosome- and ER-related
cell death accompanied by morphological changes, possibly through 4-(Ca2+-CaM) complexation.

Evaluation of the Complexation
of IPHs with CaM by 27 MHz QCM Analysis
Based on our previous
observation regarding the interaction of IPHs with CaM,24,25,29 the interaction of 4 with CaM was assessed by 27 MHz quartz crystal microbalance (QCM)
measurements. CaM was immobilized on a sensor chip, to which
1 μL of the stock solutions of 4 (0.39 mM), 5 (0.50 mM), and 3c (0.41 mM) in PBS was injected
in the absence of Ca2+ (Figure S3a in the Supporting Information); as shown in Figure S3b in the Supporting Information, 4 was
added to the Ca2+ complex of CaM (1 μL of a 40 mM
CaCl2 solution was first added to CaM, after which an aliquot
of the 0.39 mM aqueous solution of 4 was injected). From
the ΔF decay curves, the complexation constants
(Kapp) of 4, 5, and 3c were determined to be (1.0 ± 0.1) ×

which their dissociation constants (Kd) were calculated to be 0.94 ± 0.05, 1.1 ± 0.1, and 8.3
± 0.1 μM, respectively (Table 1). The interaction of 4 with
CaM in the presence of Ca2+ (80 μM) was somewhat
weaker, and the Kapp and Kd values were determined to be (3.0 ± 0.1) ×
105 M–1 and 3.3 ± 0.1 μM,
respectively (Figure S3b in the Supporting
Information and Table 1).

As a reference compound,
the Kapp and Kd values of trifluoperazine (TFP),53,54 which is a
CaM-binding molecule (Chart S2 in the Supporting
Information), were determined to be 1.20 × 105 M–1 and 8.3 μM, respectively (Figure S3c in the Supporting Information and Table 1). These data imply that 4, 5, 3c, and TFP bind to CaM with Kd values of 0.9–8.3 μM. Although
TFP only weakly induces the cell death of Jurkat cells (EC50 ≈ 50 μM), cooperative effects with 4 (25
μM) were observed to be negligible (data not shown).

In Figure 8a–d, negligible
overlap of the green emission from 4 and the red emission
from the anti-CaM antibody (+secondary IgG H&L-Alexa Fluor 594)
was observed. Then, the binding affinity of the anti-CaM antibody
(Abcam) with CaM was checked by QCM analysis in the presence (80 μM)
and absence of Ca2+ (Figure S6 and Table S3 in the Supporting Information). The Kapp and Kd values of the anti-CaM
antibody were determined to be (4.22 ± 0.15) × 108 M–1 and 2.4 ± 0.1 nM, respectively, in the
absence of Ca2+. However, the interaction of the antibody
with CaM was very weak in the presence of Ca2+ (>1 mM),
suggesting that the anti-CaM antibody has weak affinity with the Ca2+ complex of CaM. It was assumed that this is the reason why
negligible overlap of the emission of 4 and the anti-CaM
antibody was observed in Figure 8a–d.

It is known that CaM binds to four
Ca2+ ions via four EF hands with Kd values of 0.5–5 μM, which are dependent on the
Ca2+ binding sites in N- and C-terminal EF hands.39 The aforementioned
results of the QCM analysis using CaM, Ca2+, and 4 (Table 1)
suggest that the complex of 4 with Ca2+-free
CaM (Kd = 0.94 μM) is slightly more
stable than that of 4 with Ca2+-CaM (Kd = 3.3 μM). It should also be noted that
these Kd values between 4 and CaM are close to the Kd values of 4 and (Ca2+)n–CaM
complexes (n = 0–4) (Chart 4).

Western Blot Analysis of Jurkat Cells Treated with 4
The aforementioned results strongly suggest that IPHs induce
some sort of programmed cell death (PCD), which can be categorized
into several types such as apoptosis, necroptosis, paraptosis, and
autophagic cell death.51,55−63 For the further study of this issue, we checked the expression levels
of proteins that are related to apoptosis, autophagy, and some signaling
pathway in Jurkat cells that had been treated with 4 by
Western blot analysis (Figure 9). The degradation of caspase-3 was negligible, suggesting
that this is not an apoptosis process, as previously shown in Figure 4g–i.

Figure 9 Western blot
analysis of Jurkat cells treated with 4 (0–25
μM). Proteins related to (a) autophagy, (b) MAPK signaling pathway,
and (c) PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, (d) ER stress, (e) CaM, and (f)
apoptosis were investigated in a dose-dependent manner.

In Figure 9a, LC3-I, LC3-II, Beclin-1, and Atg-12, which are autophagy markers,
were upregulated by 4 in a dose-dependent manner. We
further examined the autophagy signaling pathway such as mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) (Figure 9b), the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (Figure 9c), and ER stress (Figure 9d). In Figure 9b, p-p38 (phosphorylated form of p38), p-ERK-1, -2 (ERK: extracellular regulated kinase), p-JNK (JNK: c-jun N-terminal kinase 1), and CHOP, which
are typical marker molecules of the MAPK signaling pathway, were upregulated
after the treatment by 4; in contrast, only negligible
changes were observed in the expression levels of proteins related
to the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (Akt and p-Akt)
and ER stress (IRE1α, p-eIF2a, and Bip) (Figure 9c,d). Change in the
expression levels of CaM was also negligible (Figure 9e). In addition, negligible effect of 4 was observed in the apoptosis signaling pathway in Jurkat
cells (Figure 9f).

To evaluate the role of the MAPK signaling pathway in this process,
the effects of SCH772984, SP600125, and U0126, which are ERK, JNK,
and MEK inhibitors (see Chart S4 in the
Supporting Information for their chemical structures), respectively,
were assessed (Figure 10). In Figure 10a,
morphological changes (and cell death) of Jurkat cells by 4 were observed, and the dead cells exhibited a strong green emission
from 4. The results of MTT assays indicate that negligible
inhibition of cell death induced by 4 (25 μM, 1
h) was observed by SCH772984, SP600125, or U0126 (Figure 10b), suggesting that autophagy-mediated
cell death through the MAPK signaling pathway is not a major pathway
in 4-induced cell death.

Cytoplasmic Vacuolization of Jurkat Cells Induced by 4
We also suspected that paraptosis, a process that has been
reported as a relatively new category of PCD,55 might be involved. Choi et al. reported that celastrol (Chart 5), a naturally occurring
triterpenoid isolated from Tripterygium wilfordii, induces the swelling of the ER and/or mitochondria through the
release of Ca2+ from the ER and its subsequent influx into
mitochondria, accompanied by the activation of the ERK signaling pathway.56,57 Xue and co-workers reported that morusin (Chart 5), which was isolated from Morus australis, induces paraptosis with similar
morphological changes and the development of a signaling pathway similar
to that for celastrol.58

Chart 5 Figure 10b,c shows images of Jurkat cells that were
treated with 4 (25 μM) for 1 h, fixed with glutaraldehyde
and osmium tetroxide (OsO4), embedded into Poly 812 resin,
sliced, and then stained with methylene blue. These pictures clearly
show vacuolization of the cytoplasm and intracellular organelle (it
has been described in the literature that cytoplasmic vacuolization
is triggered by the damage of mitochondria and ER)55−58 in Jurkat cells and morphological
changes. The same intracellular morphological changes were observed
by the treatment with celastrol (1 μM and incubation for 24
h) (Figure 11d,e).

Scale bar (black) is 10 μm, and scale bar (white) is 5 μm.

In addition, transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
images of Jurkat cells treated with 4 and celastrol were
also undertaken. Pictures in Figure 12 display the vacuolization in Jurkat cells, similar
to Figure 11, strongly
implying that 4 and celastrol induce similar PCD, which
can be classified into paraptosis although their PCD-inducing mechanisms
are somewhat different, as described in Figure 6 in the text and Figure S4 in the Supporting Information. These results also suggest
that the staining experiments of dead cells with glutaraldehyde, OsO4, and methylene blue shown in Figure 11 may be a more convenient and cheaper method
than TEM experiments to characterize paraptosis and the related PCD.

Plausible Mechanism for
Cell Death Induced by 4
The aforementioned experimental
results are summarized as follows and in Chart 6.(1) The cytotoxicity of 4 is more potent than
the reference compound 5, which could be attributed to
its more efficient intracellular uptake than that of 5, partially due to the position of peptide units (Figures 2 and 3). The similar order of the EC50 value of 4 to that of 5 is controlled by the affinity of these
IPHs to the target biomolecules, whose affinity with these IPHs would
be on the order of micromolar.

(2) IPH 4 enhances the concentration of Ca2+ in mitochondria rather than in cytosol (Figures 5 and 6), possibly
by Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and
then induces the loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), which triggers the malfunction of mitochondria (Figure 8o–r). Recently,
it has been described that the excessive Ca2+ release promotes
PCD and proliferation via Ca2+-signaling events in the
ER and mitochondrion,32 which may support
our hypothesis. This mechanism is also supported by the findings that
cell death was considerably inhibited by CCCP, which is an inhibitor
of mitochondrial Ca2+ influx and an uncoupling reagent
that compromises the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) (Figures 4d–f and 7h–j). Further studies
indicated that 4 induces mitochondrial Ca2+ overload within 15 min after the addition to Jurkat cells, as evidenced
by Figure 6c. In contrast,
celastrol, a naturally occurring triterpenoid, stimulates cytosolic
Ca2+ overload in 1–5 h after the addition to Jurkat
cells (Figure S7 in the Supporting Information).

(3) Another possibility is
that 4 binds to actin and promotes the degradation of
actin filaments and the morphological changes in Jurkat cells (Figures 1 and 8e–k). It is also reported that the enhancement of intracellular
Ca2+ collapses the bundling of actin filaments, resulting
in morphological changes in the cells.64−66

(4) The results of QCM measurements of CaM with 4 indicated that 4 binds to a Ca2+-free CaM (Kd = 0.94 μM) a little
bit more strongly than to the Ca2+–CaM complex (Kd = 3.3 μM) (Figures S5 and S6 in the Supporting Information, Table 1, and Chart 4). These experimental results allow us to consider
two possibilities: the stimulation of the intracellular cell death
pathway by the CaM-4 and ((Ca2+)n-CaM)-4 complexation (n = 0–4) and the inhibition of the Ca2+–CaM
complex due to the occupation of the Ca2+ binding site
by 4, resulting in intracellular Ca2+ overload.
In this case, there might be unidentified target biomolecules that
induce the release of Ca2+ from intracellular organelles
such as ER. Our attempt at the crystallization of the complex of 4 with CaM in the presence and absence of Ca2+ for
the X-ray crystallization analysis is now in progress to elucidate
the molecular mechanism of paraptosis induced by 4 and
to explain the different responses of cancer cells to IPHs, TFP, and
other drugs.

(5) The results
of Western blot analysis revealed that 4 induces the
upregulation of typical marker proteins of paraptosis and autophagy
(LC3-II, Beclin-1, and Atg-12) through the MAPK signaling pathway
(phosphorylation of p38, ERKs, and JNK 1), possibly by CaMKK and CaMKII
activated by a (Ca2+-CaM)–4 complex,
rather than the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and ER stress (Figure 9). However, the cell
death of Jurkat cells by 4 was negligibly inhibited by
an ERK inhibitor (SCH772984), a JNK inhibitor (SP600125), and an MEK
inhibitor (U0126) (Figure 10), indicating that autophagy-mediated cell death is not the
main pathway of cell death.

(6) It is strongly suggested that the cell death induced by 4 is a paraptosis-like cell death, as evidenced by cytoplasmic vacuolization,
which was also observed by a treatment with celastrol, which had been
reported to induce Ca2+ overload and paraptosis in the
literature.56,57 We therefore assessed the cytosolic
and mitochondrial Ca2+ concentrations induced by celastrol
by flow cytometric analysis (Figure S7 in
the Supporting Information). Interestingly, it was found that celastrol
induces considerable increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations
slowly (in ca. 1–5 h) with a small change in the mitochondrial
Ca2+ concentration. These findings suggest that 4 and celastrol induce paraptosis-like cell death via different responses
of intracellular Ca2+. It is unlikely that the influx of
Ca2+ into mitochondria occurs from cytosol in the case
of 4, according to negligible or weak enhancement of
the emission of a cytosolic Ca2+ probe, Rhod-4 (Figure 5a,b). In addition,
the cell death induced by 4 was negligibly inhibited
by a Ca2+ chelator, BAPTA (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). We assume that 4 induces
the direct transportation of Ca2+ from ER to mitochondria
and then loss of ΔΨm, resulting in paraptosis-like
cell death accompanied by their vacuolization, although the roles
of the interaction of 4 with CaM in these processes are
yet to be studied.

(7) It has very recently been reported that organometallic complexes
such as ruthenium, copper, and titanium induce paraptosis.67−73 Although these metal complexes also induce cytoplasmic vacuolization
through the damage of mitochondria, lysosome, and/or ER, a slightly
longer time (3–24 h) is required to induce cell death of cancer
cells. On the contrary, IPHs 4 and 5 quickly
induce the paraptosis-like cell death of Jurkat cells, and the resulting
dead cells can be detected by their strong green emission.



Chart 6 Conclusions
In this manuscript, we have succeeded in
synthesizing the amphiphilic IPH 4 containing cationic
peptides at the 4′-position of the ppy ligands through glycolic
acid units, which exhibits green emission for use in mechanistic studies
of cell death. These newly synthesized IPHs exhibit a green emission,
and their lifetimes are on the order of microseconds, due to phosphorescence
from the excited triplet states, as supported by TD-DFT calculations.
According to fluorescence microscopic observations and MTT assays,
IPH 4 has more potent cytotoxicity against Jurkat cells
(cancer cells) than 3a–d and 5, accompanied
by membrane disruption, whereas negligible induction of cell death
against IMR90 cells (normal cells) was observed. It was also found
that 4 is uptaken into Jurkat cells more efficiently
than our previous IPH 5. Detailed mechanistic studies
allowed us to conclude that 4 induces the paraptosis-like
cell death of Jurkat cells via a Ca2+-dependent pathway
including the direct influx of Ca2+ from ER into mitochondria,
the decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), and the vacuolization of the cytoplasm and intracellular
organelle, although we do not exclude the possibility that stimulation
of mitochondria by Ca2+ overload would induce the production
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to promote PCD, as described in the
literature,59,60,74 and another possibility is that 4 induces the degradation
of actin, leading to the morphological change of Jurkat cells.32

The direct or close contact of the ER
or the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in the case of neural and muscle
cells and mitochondria for the Ca2+ and lipid exchange
and other cross-talk has been proposed not only in cancer cells but
also in neural cells, muscle cells, and so on.74−81 To the best of our knowledge, 4 and its analogs such
as 2b–d and 3b,c are
the first class of molecules that induces direct Ca2+ transfer
from the ER into mitochondria to activate the PCD mechanism of cancer
cells. These results suggest that the control of Ca2+ homeostasis
between ER and mitochondria could be one of the important targets
in the chemotherapy of cancer and related diseases.

The information
described in this manuscript would be useful for understanding the
mechanisms of paraptosis and the future design and synthesis of amphiphilic
anticancer agents in bioorganic chemistry, medicinal chemistry, and
related research fields. More detailed mechanistic studies including
cocrystallization of these IPHs with CaM and screening of more appropriate
peptide sequences are currently in progress.

Measurements of UV–Vis
Absorption and Luminescence Spectra
UV–vis spectra
were recorded on JASCO V-630 and V-650 UV–vis spectrophotometers,
and emission spectra were recorded on a JASCO FP-6200 or FP-6500 spectrofluorometer
with excitation and emission slit widths at 5 nm at 25 °C. Sample
solutions in quartz cuvettes equipped with Teflon septum screw caps
were degassed by Ar bubbling through the solution for 10 min prior
to making the luminescence measurements. The luminescence quantum
yields (Φ) were determined by comparison with the integrated
corrected emission spectrum of quinine sulfate (Φ = 0.55 in
0.1 M H2SO4)82,83 when excited
at 366 nm. In the case of excitation at 425 nm, Φ values were
determined by comparison with Ir(tpy)31 (Φ
= 0.5 in CH2Cl2).6,29Equation 1 was used for calculating
the emission quantum yields, in which Φs and Φr denote the quantum yields of the sample and reference compound,
respectively, and ηs and ηr are the refractive indexes of the solvents
used for the measurements of the sample and reference, respectively
(η: 1.33 for H2O, 1.42 for CH2Cl2, and 1.48 for DMSO). As and Ar denote the absorbance of the sample and reference,
respectively. 1

aqueous solutions at 298 K were measured on a TSP1000-M-PL (Unisoku,
Osaka, Japan) instrument using THG (355 nm) of Nd:YAG laser, Minilite

with PBS (500 μL). After this, an aqueous solution of CaCl2 (40 mM) was added to adjust the final Ca2+ concentration
in the QCM cell to 80 μM for the QCM experiments in the presence
of Ca2+. The apparent binding constants (Kapp) for Ir complexes with CaM in PBS were calculated
from the decrease in frequency (ΔF). The nonspecific
response was subtracted from the frequency decrease curve to obtain
the apparent complexation constants (Kapp) and the dissociation constants (Kd (=1/Kapp)).

Western Blot Analysis
Jurkat cells (3.0 × 106 cells) were treated with
Ir complexes and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in an atmosphere
of 5% CO2. After the treatment, cells were washed twice
with ice-cold PBS and proteins were extracted by RIPA buffer (Nacalai
Tesque, Japan). The extracted proteins were quantified by the Pierce
BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific). Then, 50 μg (per
well) of proteins was used for SDS-PAGE (7.5–15%) (BioRad).
After SDS-PAGE, the gel was transferred to a poly(vinylidene fluoride)
membrane (Merck Millipore, Germany) using a semidry blotter (BioRad).
The membrane was blocked with Blocking One solution (Nacalai Tesque,
Japan) for 30 min at room temperature. After blocking, the membrane
was washed three times with TBST (5 min each time) and incubated overnight
with primary antibodies at a dilution of 1/1000 in a signal enhancer
HIKARI-solution A (Nacalai Tesque, Japan). On the next day, the membrane
was washed three times with TBST and incubated for 60 min at room
temperature with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody such as antirabbit
or antimouse at a dilution of 1/200 or 1/1000 in signal enhancer HIKARI-solution
B. The protein signal was spotted by Chemi-Lumi One Ultra solution
(Nacalai Tesque, Japan) using the ChemiDoc MP system (BioRad).

MTT Assay
of Jurkat Cells in the Presence of Inhibitors
Jurkat cells
(1.0 × 105 cells/mL, 100 μL) were preincubated in a 10% FBS RPMI 1640 medium containing inhibitors
under 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 30 min and then treated
with 4 (25 μM) for 1 h in 96-well plates (BD Falcon).
After incubating the cells at 37 °C for 4 h, 0.5% MTT reagent
in PBS (10 μL) was added to the cells, after which a formazan
lysis solution (10% SDS in 0.01 N HCl) (100 μL) was added and
the resulting solution incubated overnight under the same conditions,
followed by measurement of the absorbance at 570 nm using a microplate
reader (BIO-RAD).

Methylene Blue Staining and Transmission
Electron Microscopy (TEM) Analysis of Jurkat Cells Treated with 4
Jurkat cells (3.0 × 106 cells)
were incubated with 4 (25 μM) in an RPMI 1640 medium
with 10% FBS at 37 °C under 5% CO2 for 1 h. After
the incubation, the cells were collected by centrifugation and washed
with ice-cold PBS containing 0.1% NaN3 and 0.5% FBS twice
and then prefixed with glutaraldehyde (2.5%) at 4 °C for 40 min
and washed with ice-cold PBS twice. Postfixing was conducted with
osmium tetroxide (1%) at 4 °C for 30 min. After washing, the
cells were included
in an agarose gel and dehydrated with 50–100% anhydrous EtOH.
Embedding of the cells in Poly 812 resin (Nisshin EM Co. Ltd.) was
conducted at 60 °C for 3 days. The resin was sliced with a glass
knife (150 nm thickness) on an ultramicrotome (EM UC6, Leica), and
the sections were stained with methylene blue for microscopic observation
on a microscope (BX51, Olympus) (Figure 11). For transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) observation, the sliced samples (ca. 100 nm thickness) were
stained with an EM stainer (Nisshin EM Co. Ltd.) and observed on a
TEM instrument (H-7650, HITACHI) with electron irradiation at 100
kV (Figure 12).
