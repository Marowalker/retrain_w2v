Here, we report on
a first mechanochemical synthesis of ettringite,
an important cement hydrate phase. The mineral compound ettringite
([Ca3Al(OH)6]2·(SO4)3·26H2O) occurs rarely in nature, but
is common for cement-based materials. Ettringite has wide technical
application in the ceramic and paper industry. However, its typical
wet-chemical synthesis is cumbersome and produces waste water and
CO2 emissions. Here, we investigate the first mechanochemical
synthesis of ettringite for developing an easy and sustainable alternative
for industrial application. The mechanosynthesis was monitored in
situ by coupled synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) and infrared thermography
(IRT). The consumption of the reactants and the formation of the reaction
product were monitored with time-resolved XRD. IRT showed the temperature
increase based on the exothermic reaction. The reaction conversion
was significantly improved changing the strategy of the mechanosynthesis
from a one- to a two-step process. The latter included neat pregrinding
of solid reactants followed by a delayed addition of the stoichiometric
amount of water. Thus, an increase of reaction conversion from 34
to 94% of ettringite could be achieved.

1 Introduction
Mechanochemistry has experienced
significant development over the
last decade. A variety of organic and inorganic materials and compounds
were successfully synthesized via mechanochemical routes, including
cocrystals, metal–organic frameworks, pharmaceuticals, alloys,
and composites.1−19

The increasing use of these mechanosyntheses benefits from
their
high efficiency, which allows improved reactivity and higher yields.15,20−23 Products of sufficient-to-high purity can be obtained, making additional
purification steps redundant.24 Solvent
usage and chemical waste can be avoided, thus designating mechanochemical
syntheses as “green chemistry”.

We applied mechanochemistry
to synthesize ettringite, a significant
constituent of the cementitious materials.25,26 Besides the importance for cementitious materials, ettringite is
further used as a mineral filler and gloss-white pigment in ceramic
and paper industry.27 Furthermore, the
channel structure of ettringite causes its high ion exchange capacity.
This property can be exploited for the treatment of industrial wastes.
Ion exchange properties can adversely influence the reliability of
cement-based hazardous waste storages.28−36 Industrial synthesis of ettringite includes precipitation from the
reactant containing suspension, along with product purification and
dehydration.27 Typical laboratory syntheses
follow similar routes, thus remaining time and energy consuming and
generating CO2 emissions and waste water.36−39 Hence, a sustainable and clean synthesis of ettringite could be
an alternative or a complementary way for the industrial applications.

The aim of this study is to explore the mechanochemical synthesis
of ettringite toward possible industrial application. The mechanosynthesis
was followed in situ by coupled synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD)
and infrared thermography (IRT) analyses. Consumption of reactants,
possible intermediates, and products was monitored using time-resolved
synchrotron XRD. On the basis of these data, intermediate stages can
be identified and insights into the mechanism of the reaction can
be obtained. Simultaneous tracking of temperature changes with IRT
visualizes the heat release during the exothermic reaction as an additional
indication of the reaction progress (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Schematics of the syntheses: left: one-step
mechanosynthesis, right:
two-step mechanosynthesis. Both processes were followed in situ by
coupled IRT and synchrotron XRD analyses using the setup shown on
the bottom left. Solid reactants include Ca(OH)2 (yellow),
Al(OH)3 (green), and CaSO4·2H2O (red).

2 Results and Discussion
The mechanosyntheses were performed according to the reaction (eq 1) in a vibration ball mill
Pulverisette 23 (Fritsch, Germany) at the frequency of 50 Hz. The
grinding experiments were carried out in the 10 mL poly(methyl methacrylate)
(trade name: Perspex) grinding jar. The common use of the steel mill
balls was avoided due to the possible incorporation of iron into the
structure of ettringite through the replacement of aluminum. Instead,
two zirconia balls with the diameter of 10 mm and the weight of 3
g each were used. Aluminum hydroxide Al(OH)3 (Kraft, ≥99%),
calcium sulfate dihydrate CaSO4·H2O (Kraft,
≥98%), calcium hydroxide Ca(OH)2 (Sigma-Aldrich,
≥96%), and water (Milli-Q, 18.2 MΩ·cm) were used
as reactants. 1  The coupled in
situ synchrotron XRD–IRT
experiments were performed at Bessy II (HZB, Berlin). For further
details on the setup and procedure of the coupled XRD–IRT analyses,
the reader is referred to our previous publication.40 The synchrotron beam with the energy of 12.4 keV was applied
for the XRD analysis in transmission geometry. The diffractograms
were detected with a time resolution of 30 s. An infrared camera was
simultaneously used to detect temperature development on the surface
of the grinding jar. Thermograms were recorded with a frame rate of
10 Hz. The relative temperature change ΔT was
calculated as a difference between the temperature of the jar and
room temperature.

The one-step mechanosynthesis includes filling
in stoichiometric
amounts of all reactants including water into the grinding jar and
continuous grinding for 2 h. The product was a damp claylike mixture
consisting of reactants and ettringite (Figure 2, left). It should be emphasized that the
total amount of added water becomes incorporated into the structure
of the formed ettringite if the complete reaction is achieved. Thus,
the consistency of the resulting product indicates the presence of
free water in the product mixture additionally suggesting the incomplete
reaction. To assess the conversion of the mechanochemical synthesis,
the XRD data were refined using the Rietveld method. The results show
the formation of 34% ettringite and remaining 44% calcium sulfate
dihydrate, 9% calcium hydroxide, and 13% aluminum hydroxide.

data of the mechanochemical ettringite formation. Left:
one-step mechanosynthesis; right: two-step mechanosynthesis with delayed
water addition after 90 min of neat grinding of solid reactants. Reflection
positions of the reactants and ettringite are shown as barcodes. Bottom:
the diffractograms of the product mixtures.

To improve the reaction conversion, a two-step mechanosynthesis
with delayed water addition was carried out. First, solid reactants
(Al(OH)3, CaSO4·2H2O, Ca(OH)2) were neatly ground for 90 min. Then, a stoichiometric amount
of water was added directly into the grinding jar and the grinding
was continued for the next 30 min. As a result, the formation of a
fluffy white powder containing ettringite and a remaining low amount
of gypsum was observed (Figure 2, right). From the Rietveld refinement, 94% of ettringite
and 6% of gypsum were calculated. The formed ettringite can be assigned
to PDF 00-037-147628 (PDF-2 2016). Disappearance of all reactant reflections
after 30 min of the neat pre-grinding indicates the amorphization
process. The influence of the neat pre-grinding duration on the reaction
conversion is a subject of current research. The preliminary results
indicate the insufficient reaction conversion similar to that in the
one-step synthesis, if the pre-grinding duration is shorter than 90
min.

On the basis of XRD data, we estimated the amounts of some
components
of the reaction mixture, calculating the area of their main reflections.
The amounts of the reactant, exemplarily gypsum, and ettringite in
the reaction mixture were plotted over time and compared with temperature
development (Figure 3). Addition of water into the jar causes a timely short abrupt decrease
of the temperature. This is followed by the sharp rise of the temperature
due to continued grinding and the intensive exothermic formation of
ettringite. This observation allows concluding that neat pre-grinding
of the solid reactants for 90 min leads to their activation. Thus,
ettringite can be formed rapidly if the stoichiometric amount of water
is added. Conversely, the availability of water at the beginning of
the one-step mechanosynthesis strongly decelerates this reaction.

Figure 3 Time evolution
of the temperature and the amounts of reactant and
product in the reaction mixture. The temperature is shown as a difference
to the room temperature (ΔT). The amounts of
the compounds were assessed by calculating peak areas of their normalized
diffraction signals: ettringite, reflection (1 0 0) at 9.1° (Cu
Kα1); calcium sulfate dihydrate, reflection (0 2
0) at 11.6° (Cu Kα1).

3 Conclusions
Summarizing, the strategy of
the mechanochemical ettringite synthesis
was optimized and the reaction conversion could be dramatically improved.
The key factor is the delayed addition of water as liquid reactant
after neat pre-grinding of the solids. Research is needed for a detailed
understanding of the observed reactant amorphization during the neat
pre-grinding, identification of amorphous intermediates, and their
role in the mechanism of the mechanochemical reaction. The influence
of the pregrinding duration on the reaction conversion is needed to
be further observed.
