Polyelectrolyte multilayer
(PEM)-supported lipid bilayers (SLBs)
that connect with functional proteins are popular models for cell
membranes and are usually obtained via vesicle adsorption and spreading.
However, the exact mechanism by which SLBs are formed is not fully
understood. In this study, we employ coarse-grained molecular dynamics
simulations to investigate the pathways by which vesicles undergo
spreading upon the deposition on PEM-cushioned substrates. The substrates
consist of positive chitosan (CHI)/negative alginate (ALG) multilayers.
We find that an isolated vesicle tends to completely disintegrate
upon deposition, forming a well-ordered lipid bilayer at appropriate
polymer ionic strengths by a mechanism described as “parachute”
model. Lipids from the vesicle’s outer leaflet are predominantly
oriented toward the bulk after the formation of the SLB. The PEM cushion
provides adsorption energy of 26.9 kJ mol–1 per
lipid for the SLBs. The process by which SLBs are formed is almost
independent of the number of layers of CHI/ALG in the PEM cushion.
Additional simulations on vesicle clusters also demonstrate that the
formation of SLBs can be catalyzed by either neighboring vesicles
or preexisting bilayer edges on the support. Moreover, our simulations
show that SLBs created on PEM supports preserve the lateral mobility
and the symmetric density profile of the phospholipids, as in a freestanding
bilayer.

Introduction
Phospholipid bilayers
are versatile artificial membranes that mimic
cell surfaces.1 They can be formed by vesicle
fusion on both solid and polymer-cushioned substrates.2,3 Supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) are molecular films with both high
mechanical stability and good accessibility to biologically relevant
molecules and are therefore widely used to study the fundamental structures
and functions of cellular membranes.2−6

McConnell and Tamm pioneered the formation of a solid-SLB
by sequential
monolayer transfer,6 making the creation
of asymmetric lipid bilayers possible. A more facile and versatile
method for SLB formation is the vesicle fusion technique, first proposed
by Brian and McConnell.4 In this technique,
the vesicles adsorb, deform, rupture, and spontaneously spread into
a continuous SLB at appropriate support surface conditions, such as
charge distribution and hydrophilicity.

Cell membranes provide
both the outer wall of cells and a support,
in which various proteins and carbohydrates are embedded. Many important
biological processes are regulated at the membrane surface, through
interactions between the membrane and proteins. The modification of
proteins and carbohydrates on model membranes is critical for biosensor
applications.5,7 Therefore, it is essential to
be able to make supported membranes that can be functionalized by
membrane-associated proteins. However, in the case of solid-supported
membranes, the membrane and substrate are only separated by a thin
lubricating film of water and have a membrane–substrate distance
of only 5–20 Å.8 This distance
is sufficient to support the lateral mobility of lipids in both leaflets
of the bilayer but not to prevent transmembrane proteins, which typically
have large domains, from coming into direct contact with the bare
substrate. Such direct contact can inhibit the proteins’ lateral
mobility and may even result in protein denaturation.9,10 To address this problem, Sackmann suggested the addition of hydrophilic
and soft polymer “cushions” between the lipid bilayer
and the solid substrate,5 to provide both
lubrication and an environment that mimics the native environment
of transmembrane proteins.2

Regenerated
cellulose is a candidate for polymer cushions with
advantageous flexibility and hydrophilicity, allowing the formation
of functional bilayers.11 Decher et al.
also proposed that polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs) could be used
for polymer cushions.12 PEMs are constructed
by a layer-by-layer self-assembly method, using the polyelectrolytes’
attractive electrostatic interactions. The simplicity of this method
provides a distinct advantage over other substrates. Charged polysaccharides
are frequently chosen for the construction of PEMs because of their
low cost and biocompatibility.13 Mulligan
et al. showed that mobile and stable lipid bilayers can form on biocompatible
polymer cushions, which consisted of chitosan and hyaluronic acid.14 Recently, chitosan/alginate (CHI/ALG) multilayer
cushions have been used as a PEM to produce a lipid bilayer.15 These two oppositely charged polysaccharides
have good hydrophilic and electrostatic properties and are biocompatible.
Experiments clearly demonstrated that mixed vesicles, consisting of
lipids phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidic acid in a 4:1 ratio, could
absorb, rupture, and spread to form SLBs on the surface of a CHI/ALG
PEM.15

Although the exposure of vesicles
to PEM-coated substrates leads
to the successful creation of SLBs, the exact bilayer formation process
cannot be followed in real time by experimental techniques. The mechanism
of SLB formation, as well as its dependence on the physicochemical
properties of the substrate, is not fully understood. Molecular dynamics
(MD) simulation is a powerful tool that offers an alternative to experimental
techniques, allowing detailed investigations of structures and mechanisms
in biological and chemical systems. Using coarse-grained (CG) MD simulation,
Xing and Faller found that the spatial arrangement of lipids in a
bilayer supported by a hydrophilic surface differs from that of the
freestanding bilayer.16 The lateral diffusion
in the inner leaflet, near the support, is slower than that in the
outer leaflet, confirming heterogeneous dynamics in these SLBs. Wu
et al. simulated the spreading of vesicles on hydrophilic solid surfaces;17 their work revealed three distinctive pathways
of vesicle deposition, depending on the lipid tail hydrophobicity
and vesicle size: (i) nondisintegration, (ii) partial disintegration,
and (iii) complete disintegration. Later, Fuhrmans et al. studied
the spreading mechanism of vesicles on solid supports by focusing
on the orientation of the resulting bilayer using a solvent-free CG
model.18 They found that the orientation
of the created SLBs depended on the range and the strength of surface
interactions as well as the roughness of the surface. Tuning these
factors resulted in a switch from an inside-up to an outside-up orientation
of the created SLBs.

Compared to those of the solid-SLBs, the
formation conditions and
the mechanism of PEM-SLBs are more complicated. Few examples of MD
simulations of the PEM-SLBs have been reported. We have recently given
a brief report on the spreading dynamics of vesicles on CHI/ALG multilayer
cushions with molecular resolution, by performing solvent-free CG
simulations.15 We found that the PEM-SLBs
were created via the formation of multiple pores at the outer edge
of the bottom of the adsorbed vesicle. The inner leaflet of the vesicles
was exposed to the surface of the PEM support through these pores.
The vesicles’ outer leaflet remained facing upward, resembling
a “parachute”. In this work, we present a more detailed
study on the deposition process of vesicles on soft supports. We investigate
the various factors affecting the spreading mechanisms of vesicles,
including the concentration of PEM, the ionic condition, the size
of the vesicle, and the clustering of vesicles. We also compare the
spatial arrangement and diffusion dynamics of lipid molecules of solid-supported,
PEM-supported, and freestanding bilayers. Our simulation results indicate
that the PEM-supported bilayer preserves the symmetric spatial molecular
distribution and the lateral mobility of phospholipids as in the freestanding
bilayer. These properties suggest that the CHI/ALG PEM cushion is
an important component for future biomimetic applications based on
lipid bilayers.

Results and Discussion
Spreading Mechanism of
Isolated Vesicles on CHI/ALG Multilayer
Cushions
Typical spreading processes of various-sized vesicles
on a two-layered soft cushion composed of 70 CHI and 70 ALG chains
(with 35 ALG chains constrained to the solid surface) are presented
in Figure 1. The time
evolution shows that all of the vesicles attach, deform, and rupture
on the soft support. More detailed snapshots viewed from various directions
in Figure 2 give clear
pictures of the vesicle spreading process: Upon binding to a soft
support, multiple pores nucleate at the outer edge of the bottom of
the adsorbed vesicle even before the vesicle deforms, with its dip
angle decreasing significantly. The inner leaflet of the vesicle encounters
the surface of the CHI/ALG cushion through the pores, whereas the
outer leaflet remains facing upward and spreads around. This pathway
resembles a parachute model. As the spreading proceeds, an additional
pore may form on the top of the deformed vesicle, resulting in a bilayer
disk with most lipids in the upper leaflet originating from the outer
leaflet of the vesicle, and a small segment with an inside-up orientation.
The dynamics of vesicle deposition is not strongly dependent on the
vesicle size. However, smaller vesicles are more easily deformed and
rupture in a shorter time than the larger ones.

vesicles composed of (a) 800 lipids,
(b) 1200 lipids, (c) 1600 lipids, and (d) 3200 lipids absorbed on
(CHI/ALG)2-cushioned supports. Snapshots are the cross-sectional
views of half-sliced vesicles. The time is set to zero when a vesicle
begins to contact the substrate. The last snapshot of each panel corresponds
to the time at which the vesicle just completely disintegrates. The
lipid head groups are red in the outer monolayer and green in the
inner monolayer. The hydrophobic tails are gray. CHI and ALG polymers
are yellow. The solid supports are black.

directions: (a) side view, (b) top view, and (c) bottom view.

The observed SLB formations
on soft PEM-cushioned supports through vesicle deposition are different
from the formation of SLBs on solid supports (ref (15) and Figure S1). On the solid substrates, even though the process
also starts with a kiss contact between a vesicle and the support,
followed by the adhesion of the vesicle onto the support, the adhesion
deforms the shape of the vesicle with a quick decrease in its dip
angle. A pore then forms in the vesicle’s side wall, close
to the top edge of the adsorbed vesicle, where the curvature is at
its maximum. Once the pore is formed, the top of the vesicle draws
back and shrinks until a bilayer patch spreads on the surface with
lipids in an inside-up orientation.

The spreading kinetics of
the vesicle can be quantitatively estimated
by calculating the ratio of lipid tail beads (Pc) that are at a distance from the support surface that
does not exceed the membrane thickness, which is approximately 4 nm
for a freestanding bilayer membrane. As shown in Figure 3, Pc gradually increases as the vesicle adheres onto the PEM-cushioned
support and saturates when a complete bilayer is formed. In contrast,
on the solid substrate (also presented in Figure 3), the time-dependent function, Pc, exhibits three clearly distinguished gradients: The
initial sharp slope corresponds to the process of vesicle adhesion.
When half of the lipids adhere to the support, the vesicle starts
to rupture. The lipids then spread on the substrate via a receding-top
pathway. The receding speed is slightly lower than the adhesion speed
because the lipids have to overcome the barriers caused by both the
curvature at the contact edges and the line tension of the ruptured
pores. Because multiple pores can be formed on the bottom of the polymer-supported
vesicle as the deformation proceeds, vesicles on the CHI/ALG cushion
spread faster than those on the solid support.

of vesicles on (CHI/ALG)2-cushioned supports (solid lines)
and solid supports (dashed lines).
Single vesicle composed of 800 and 1600 lipids, respectively, and
two interacting vesicles (each containing 800 lipids) are simulated.

Deposition processes for vesicles
on solid supports have also been
reported previously.17,18 The results implied that the
deposition mechanism was related to the surface properties, especially
the lipid head–plate interactions. It was showed that short-range
and relatively weak surface–lipid interactions favored the
rupture of vesicles at the top, creating SLBs with an inside-up orientation.
Conversely, long-range and strong interactions induced pore formation
in the bottom of the adsorbed vesicle, creating SLBs with an outside-up
orientation.18 The parachute-like pathway
of vesicle deposition on CHI/ALG PEM-cushioned supports is similar
to that seen for vesicles on solid supports with long-range surface–lipid
interactions.18 Here, the hydrophilic polyelectrolytes,
especially the anionic CHI polymers on the top layer, provide long-range
electrostatic attractive forces, which drive the cationic vesicle
to approach the substrate. Then, complicated interactions, including
the interactions between the vesicle and the inner layer, the interactions
between the vesicle and the outer layer, and the interactions between
multilayers, drive the formation of lipid bilayers on PEMs. The average
adsorption energy values per lipid that count the interactions between
the proximate lipid head groups and the supports are given in Table 1. The adsorption energy
on the solid supports is 17.1 kJ mol–1, in the range
of 1–10kBT (2.5–25
kJ mol–1 at 298 K), reported by experiments19 and all-atom MD simulations.20 The PEM cushions are relatively more attractive to the
vesicles (with the adsorption energy of 26.9 kJ mol–1) than the solid supports to the vesicles. The preference of a parachute
spreading mechanism on a PEM cushion may also relate to the roughness
of the substrate. The surface of a soft PEM film has a rougher island
structure compared to the smooth solid surface;14,21,22 thus, the heterogeneous local charge may
induce a local mechanical stress on the bottom of the adhered vesicle
and lead to a membrane breakup at that position. Overall, rough and
strongly attractive surfaces promote the formation of membrane pores
at the bottom edge of an adsorbed vesicle; smooth and weakly attractive
surfaces induce the formation of pores at the top edge of a vesicle
only when the vesicle is sufficiently deformed.

The
parachute spreading mechanism of vesicle on substrates has
been recently proved in the experiment of creating supported bilayer
from cell plasma membrane.23 In that experiment,
cell blebs containing either GPI-linked yellow fluorescent proteins
or neon-green fused transmembrane P2X2 receptors, with the addition
of PEGylated lipid vesicles, ruptured on the glass surface and resulted
in the PEG-cushioned bilayer. The orientation of the proteins demonstrated
that the extracellular domains face toward the bulk. Cell blebs might
be used as an intermediate to investigate the spreading mechanism
of vesicles on various PEM cushions.

Effects of Polyelectrolyte
Polymer Concentration
The
mechanism of the formation of SLBs on the CHI/ALG cushion is almost
independent of the number of polymer chains, supposing the polymer
concentration is high enough to completely cover the solid substrate.
As shown in Figure S2, when the number
of both CHI and ALG polymer chains increases from 50 to 70 (half of
the ALG chains are constrained close to the solid support via a harmonic
potential, so the cushion has a roughly two-layered structure), the
approaching vesicles rupture and spread to form a bilayer through
the same parachute mechanism. The spreading mechanism also remains
unchanged regardless of whether the number of layers of CHI/ALG polymers
is reduced or increased (Figure S3). Nevertheless,
it is noteworthy that when the concentration of CHI and ALG increases,
the electrostatic attraction between the polyelectrolyte cushions
and the vesicle is enhanced, leading to a faster vesicle adsorption
and a more efficient spontaneous bilayer formation (Figures S3 and S4). These properties indicate that by tuning
the thickness of the cushion, the PEM supports can be adjusted to
meet specific needs, such as to embed various-sized proteins into
membranes.

A recent experiment reported that on PEM cushions
composed of poly-l-lysine (PLL) hydrobromide and poly-l-glutamic acid (PGA) sodium, vesicle adsorption and rupture
depended on the thickness of the cushion.24 In that experiment, a multilayered PLL/PGA mixture was adsorbed
on a surface that was coated by positively charged branched poly(ethyleneimine)
(PEI). The SLB formation was observed only at surfaces covered with
a thin polycation film, whereas the deposition of intact vesicles
was observed on a thick multilayer cushion. These observations indicated
that for a thin polycation film, the substrate induced a strong mechanical
stress in the vesicle, inducing rupture. In addition, the thin film
might have an island structure, which would also contribute to the
locally induced mechanical stress. In contrast, films consisting of
a larger number of polyelectrolyte layers were softer and more homogeneous
and thus induced less stress in the vesicles. The differences between
our simulations and the experiments may be due to the structural and
amphiphilic differences between polysaccharides CHI/ALG and polypeptides
PLL/PGA. First, the polyringed structure of the polysaccharides enables
them to cover the substrate well, even when there is only a single
layer of CHI/ALG mixture. As a result, the stress induced in the vesicle
by the solid substrate can be screened. Second, the terminal surface
of CHI/ALG multilayer films is highly hydrophilic, making CHI/ALG
similar to silica wafers. Thus, the CHI/ALG surface itself is sufficient
to induce vesicle rupture, even though the influence of the solid
substrate on the vesicle is reduced. Although the terminal layer of
the PLL/PGA film is also positively charged, the lack of hydroxyl
groups may reduce its ability to disrupt the adsorbed vesicles.

Effects of Ionic Conditions
In experiments, the pH
of the aqueous environment plays a crucial role in the formation of
SLBs, influencing the charge concentration of the polyelectrolytes
and the corresponding interaction strength between the vesicles and
the polyelectrolytes.15,25−27 To study the
effect of charge concentrations of CHI/ALG cushions on the bilayer
formation, we tuned the charge distribution and amount in two ways:
(1) We reduced the number of charged beads on each polymer, with each
Q-type bead still carrying one unit of charge. The modified Q-beads
are reassigned as P-type. (2) We kept the amount of Q-type beads consistent
with earlier experiments but reduced the charge of each Q-type bead
from unit to a fractional value. (The pH conditions also affect the
ionic strength of the vesicles, but for simplicity, we did not change
the ratio of anionic lipids and the amount of charges in the vesicles
in the simulations.) In both cases, the PEM cushions became thicker
because of the reduced electrostatic interactions between the polymers.
For a thin cushion prepared by method 1, a significant reduction of
the charged bead may disturb the layered structure and cause the solid
substrate to be exposed to the aqueous environment. To avoid these
effects, we only consider relatively thick cushions that can maintain
layered structures when the charges are reduced. As shown in Figure S4a, for the (CHI/ALG)2 cushion
composed of 70 CHI and 70 ALG polymer chains, at sufficiently low
surface charge density (charge ratio, r = 1/6), a
vesicle remains intact; at an intermediate surface charge density
(r = 1/4), the soft cushion is rough and leads to
the creation of mixed layers containing lipid bilayers and monolayers;
and at a relatively high surface charge density (r = 1/2 or 1), the soft cushion is smooth and has a layered structure,
and the bilayer is obtained via the parachute mechanism. Using method
2, the charge distribution is conserved even when the charge of each
Q-bead is changed from 1 to 0.2. The resulting cushion can maintain
a layered structure. Well-ordered bilayers are still the main outcome
of these cushioned supports (Figure S4b). These results indicate that appropriate charge density and distribution
of the polyelectrolytes, determined by the aqueous environment being
within a particular pH range, are essential to create well-ordered
SLBs.

Spreading of Two Vesicles on CHI/ALG Multilayer Cushions
Previous simulations of vesicles on solid supports demonstrated that
the final outcomes were significantly affected by vesicle fusion,
both before and after adsorption.17 In
this work, we also investigated the clustering effects for vesicles
on a soft CHI/ALG cushion support. As shown in Figure 4, when two neighboring vesicles (each containing
800 lipid molecules) are located relatively far from the CHI/ALG substrate,
they incline to fuse into a bigger ellipsoid vesicle before adsorbing
onto the support. Because the fusion of the vesicles releases part
of the tension and the inflation from an ellipsoid vesicle to a spherical
vesicle is a slow process, the fused vesicle does not adhere to and
spread efficiently on the support although part of it may occasionally
touch the PEM support. On the other hand, if two vesicles fuse after
they adsorb onto the cushions, a well-ordered SLB is created through
the parachute mechanism (Figure 4b). It takes a slightly longer time for these two interacting
vesicles to spread to a bilayer than that for a single isolated vesicle
(see the kinetic spreading profile in Figure 4). The two vesicles sterically hinder each
other, reducing their spreading speed. Nevertheless, this speed is
still much higher than that for the rupturing of a double-sized vesicle.

Figure 4 Snapshots
of two interacting vesicles spreading on (CHI/ALG)2-cushioned
supports: (a) two vesicles fuse before they contact
the support; (b) two vesicles fuse after they adsorb onto the support;
(c) the late-coming vesicle locates above a precreated bilayer; (d,
e) the late-coming vesicle is located near the edge of the bilayer.
The head groups of the preexisting bilayer are purple for clarity.

We also simulated the deposition
of a vesicle onto a substrate,
on which a continuous SLB already existed. If the incoming vesicle
is located just above the bilayer, it deforms but maintains an intact
structure (Figure 4c). Because both the vesicle and the bilayer are anionic, they only
weakly adhere, which does not induce enough stress to break the second
vesicle. This process is advantageous for creating unilamellar membranes.
If the incoming vesicle is close to the bilayer and part of it can
approach the substrate, it spreads like an isolated vesicle, then
fuses with the edge of the preexisting bilayer, and finally develops
into a bigger continuous bilayer (Figure 5d,e). These simulations show that an additional
stress is induced in the vesicle when it contacts either the edge
of the bilayer or the neighboring vesicles on the substrate, which
catalyzes the formation of SLBs. These results are consistent with
recent experiments.28

lines) and tail beads (dashed lines) of freestanding bilayers (black),

proximal (dashed lines) leaflets of freestanding bilayers (black),
SLBs on solid substrates (blue), and SLBs on (CHI/ALG)2-cushioned substrates (red).

Features of SLBs on PEM Cushions
The spatial structures
of SLBs created via vesicle spreading are illustrated by the density
distribution profiles of the choline head group and the hydrocarbon
beads in Figure 5a.
For comparison, the profiles of the freestanding bilayer and the SLB
on solid support are also given. An important feature of SLBs on CHI/ALG
cushions is their symmetric bilayer structure. As shown in Figure 5a, the proximal and
distal leaflets have almost identical lipid-density-distribution profiles,
which are comparable to those of the freestanding bilayers. On the
other hand, the resulting bilayer on the solid substrate is asymmetrical;
the lipids in the leaflet that is proximal to the support are more
confined than those in the distal leaflet. Despite the fact that the
presence of CHI/ALG cushions has no significant effect on the symmetry
of the created SLBs, the attractive polymer surface increases the
area per lipid and decreases the corresponding membrane thickness
compared to that of the freestanding bilayers, as summarized in Table 1.

It is natural
that in a support system, the two leaflets no longer have the same
environment; the leaflet proximal to the surface of the substrate
is attracted to the support, leading to a high confinement and a solid-like
order. The distal leaflet is instead only weakly affected by the support;
therefore, its density is similar to that of a freestanding bilayer.29 Then, it raises the question, why does the PEM-cushioned
support create a symmetric bilayer? We propose that the PEM may provide
an environment similar to water for the bilayers. There are several
possible ways: First, the soft nature of the PEM allows the head groups
of lipids to have more freedom to fluctuate. Second, the rough, rather
than smooth, surface of the polymer film breaks the solid-like order
of the bilayer, as on the solid support. Third, the PEM resembles
the fluid environment because it allows certain mobility. Finally,
more water can be trapped in the region between the bilayer and the
PEM cushion; water can even permeate into the hydrophilic cushion
(although water is not explicitly shown in the implicit solvent simulations).
Therefore, the two leaflets of the bilayer are in similar environments.

Mobility is another important character of biological membranes.
Lateral diffusion is used to characterize the continuity and fluidity
of membranes. We employed the Einstein diffusion formula to calculate
the lateral diffusion coefficient of a well-ordered bilayer on the
solid support 1  where ⟨[r⃗(t) – r⃗(t0)]2⟩ is the mean-squared
displacement
(MSD) averaged over the center of mass of selected lipids. The MSD
in Figure 5b and the
diffusion constants in Table 1 show that on both soft and solid supports, the lipids in
the proximal leaflet diffuse about two times slower than those in
the distal leaflet because the surface attraction of the supports
reduces the mobility of the proximal leaflet, whereas the distal leaflet
is less affected and has comparable mobility to that found in a freestanding
bilayer. These are consistent with previous experiments.30 It is interesting to note that although the
SLBs on PEM supports have a more symmetric density profile than those
on solid support, their mobility is more heterogeneous. Such behavior
is mainly caused by the stronger and complex interactions between
the bilayer and the PEM cushion (see Table 1), which restrain the motion of the lipids
in the inner leaflet.

Conclusions
In a summary, the CG
MD simulations in this work reveal that the
SLB formation on CHI/ALG multilayer cushions occurs through vesicle
adsorption and rupture. We find that at appropriate ionic conditions,
the rough and strongly attractive surface of the PEM cushion promotes
an isolated vesicle composed of zwitterionic and anionic lipids to
deposit and spread on the soft cushion via a parachute model. Vesicle
adsorption induces the formation of multiple pores at the outer edge
of the bottom of the vesicle. Through these pores, the lipids from
the vesicle’s inner leaflet make contact with the surface of
the PEM support, resulting in a bilayer, in which lipids from the
outer monolayer of the vesicle are predominantly oriented toward the
bulk. The outside-up orientation of PEM-SLBs is critical for the directional
transfer of proteins from vesicles to SLBs, with the preservation
of the correct protein alignment. Moreover, the simulations show that
the process by which SLBs are formed is almost independent of the
number of layers of CHI/ALG in the PEM cushion, which is beneficial
to adjust the thickness of the cushion to embed various-sized membrane
proteins. Our simulations also demonstrate that bilayer edges and
neighboring vesicles on the substrate exert an additional stress on
the vesicle and can catalyze the formation of SLBs. The created bilayer
has two important properties: (1) it has a symmetric density profile
that is almost identical to a freestanding bilayer; (2) its lateral
mobility has a magnitude of the same order as a freestanding bilayer.
These indicate that PEM-supported bilayers mimic the cell membrane
very well.

Computational Methods
For simulations of lipids and
polymers, we employed a solvent-free
version of CG Martini, the so-called “Dry Martini”,31 with version 4.6.5 of the GROMACS package. The Martini force field as a ubiquitous tool is based on the reproduction
of portioning free energies and is parameterized in a systematic way.
It has been widely used to simulate complex molecules, including both
nonbiological and biological systems.32−35 The implicit solvent for the
Dry Martini enormously reduces the computational cost by neglecting
the solvent degrees of freedom. The nonbonded interaction matrix underlying
the Martini force field was reparametrized to account for the omitted
solvent degrees of freedom. The validation of the implicit solvent
model is usually demonstrated by comparing a variety of membrane properties
obtained using standard wet Martini and Dry Martini, including the
area per lipid, the average tail order parameter, the lateral lipid
diffusion coefficient, and the membrane area compressibility for a
large set of lipid types. In this model, the CG beads are sorted into
charged (Q), polar (P), nonpolar (N), and apolar (C) types. Each type
is further divided into sublevels on the basis of the hydrogen-bonding
ability and polarity, giving subclasses for hydrogen-donor capacities
(d), hydrogen-acceptor capacities (a), a lack of hydrogen-bond-forming
capacity (0), and the degree of polarity (from low polarity of 1 to
high polarity of 5). This classification of bead type preserves accurate
chemical properties and allows substances of the same class to be
distinguished.

In our simulations, a single layer of P-type
beads, arranged in
a square lattice, represented the solid substrate (mimicking the hydroxyl
group of the silica surface). Linearly connected interaction CG beads
represented lipids and polysaccharide molecules; each CG bead was
represented by mapping an average of four heavy atoms (three to five
in the case of ring structures to preserve the basic properties of
the polymers) and their connected hydrogen atoms. The all-atom (AA)
and the corresponding CG structures of dilauroyl phosphatidylcholine
(DLPC) lipid, dilauroyl phosphatidylglycerol (DLPG) lipid, chitosan,
and alginate are shown in Figure 6. For simplicity, we used the CG zwitterionic DLPC
and negatively charged DLPG lipid models to represent the mixed phosphatidylcholine
and phosphatidic acid lipids in the experiments. These models are
standard components of the Martini force field. Each lipid molecule
had four hydrophilic head beads and two hydrophobic tails. CHI and
ALG polymers were modeled as 64 six-bead units connected through single
bonds. By this setting, the length of the polymers was comparable
to the box size (see the following). The anionic lipid DLPG could
interact specifically with positively charged CHI beads in the polymer
cushions.

DLPC lipid is represented by a polymer having four head beads and
six tail beads. (b) A DLPG lipid is also modeled as a polymer of four
head beads and six tail beads but with one head bead of a different
type. (c) CHI is modeled as a polymer chain containing n = 64 six-bead
units. (d) ALG is also modeled as a polymer chain of 64 six-bead units.

The interactions of the CG beads
were governed by both nonbonded
and bonded potentials. The nonbonded interactions were expressed via
a shifted Lennard-Jones (LJ) 12-6 potential and a shifted Coulomb
potential for charged beads 2   3  In eq 2, σij represents
the closest
distance at zero energy, ϵij is
the strength between two beads, and ϵr is the relative dielectric constant with a value of 15. The
full interaction matrix (ϵij) was
based on the original publication of Dry Martini.31 Standard cutoffs and smoothing for the MARTINI force field
were used: the LJ potential was shifted to zero between 0.9 and 1.2
nm, and the Coulomb potential was smoothly shifted to zero between
0 and 1.2 nm. The neighbor list cutoff was set to 1.4 nm.

The
bonded interaction was described via harmonic potentials 4  with force constant Kbond and equilibrium length Rbond. The angle-bending stiffness was described by 5  with spring constant Kangle and equilibrium angle θ0. The bonded
parameters were obtained by fitting the distributions of bonds and
angles from AAMD simulations. The details of the parameters for chitosan
and alginate polymers are summarized in Table S1.

A small time step of 10 fs was used to integrate
the equations
of motion. The neighbor list was updated every 10 steps. Simulations
were performed with the second-order stochastic dynamics integrator
in GROMACS with the fiction in the Langevin equation with a time constant
(τT) of 4.0 ps. The dimension of the simulation box
was 35.25 × 35.25 × 35.25 nm3. Most simulations
were conducted in the constant-number, constant-volume, and constant-temperature
(NVT, T = 298 K) ensemble, using a Berendsen thermostat
and under periodic boundary conditions. Simulations of the free lipid
bilayer were carried out in the constant-number, constant-pressure,
and constant-temperature (NPT) ensemble, which was controlled by a
Berendsen thermostat and a Berendsen barostat. The compressibility
was set to 0 and 3 × 10–4 bar–1, respectively, in the direction normal and parallel to the bilayer
plane so that the tension was zero in the system.

The initial
conformations of vesicles containing 800, 1200, 1600,
and 3200 lipids (with DLPC/DLPG = 4:1) were prepared via self-assembly
from a planar bilayer, with diameters of approximately 12, 14, 16,
and 22 nm, respectively. Once assembled, one (or two) self-assembled
vesicle was (were) placed about 5 nm above the top of a polymer-cushioned
support. One layer of P-type beads in square lattices represented
the solid substrate, with distances of 0.5 nm between the fixed particles.
These substrate beads did not interact among themselves. A polyelectrolyte
cushion containing of one to three layers of CHI and ALG polymer chains
was placed on the top of a solid support. Each layer contained 25,
30, or 35 CHI polymer chains and the same amount of ALG polymer chains.
We note that less than 20 polymers in each layer is not enough to
well cover the solid substrate with size given here. To model the
access of the polymer cushion onto the solid substrate, the ALG polymer
chains in the first layer, just above the solid support, were constrained
close to the solid support via a weak harmonic potential (with a force
constant of 5000 kJ mol–1 nm–2 and an equilibrium length of 0.5 nm) applied to the first Qa-bead
of each monomer unit. Even though there is no water on the top of
the substrate, the dry force field parameters between the polymer
beads and the substrate beads already involve the effects of water.
Simulations with fixed lipid positions were first run for 10 ns to
relax the polymer layers. Then, simulations of up to 300 ns were performed
for the whole system, to collect data. Five independent trajectories
were simulated for each system.
