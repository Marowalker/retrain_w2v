Lu3+, with the smallest
ionic radii in lanthanide ions,
is an important and beneficial cation for tuning spectrum shifting
toward a longer wavelength by ion substitution in many phosphors for
solid-state lighting. However, in the Lu3+-substituted
garnet system, the phosphor always has smaller lattice parameters
and exhibits a shorter emission wavelength than other garnet phosphors.
The mechanism of such a spectral blue shift induced by the Lu3+-codoped garnet phosphor is still unclear. In this study,
the local and electronic structures of Lu3+-codoped and
Lu3+-undoped YAG:Ce3+ phosphor have been studied
by first-principles calculation to reveal the origin of the spectral
blue shift. Our results provide a full explanation of the experimental
data and the methodology, which is useful to understand and design
garnet phosphors with tunable emission characteristics.

1 Introduction
Oxide
garnets with good chemical and thermal stabilities have attracted much attention as promising
matrix materials for phosphors in the solid-state lighting area.1,2 Essentially, Ce3+-activated yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG)
has become the most widely used phosphor for white-light-emitting
diodes (w-LEDs) due to its satisfactory absorption of blue light,
high quantum yield, and strong resistance toward thermal quenching
of luminescence.3 However, such a seemingly
perfect material for blue LEDs suffers from the problem of spectrum
defects in the red region, which would result in a high color temperature
and low color rendering index of the produced white light when fabricated
with InGaN blue LED chips.4,5 Generally, adding red
phosphors is adopted as a common means to improve the light quality
but the luminous efficacy gets sacrificed as well. Because of the
opened framework, it is acceptable to maintain the garnet structure
with many kinds of substitutions in YAG:Ce3+ phosphor,
for instance, rare earth ions RE3+ substituting Y3+; Ga3+/Sc3+ substituting Al3+; Mg2+/Ca2+/Ba2+/Mn2+–Si4+/Ge4+/Zr4+/Hf4+ pair substituting
Al3+–Al3+ or Y3+–Al3+; Si4+/Ge4+–N3– pair substituting Al3+–O2–,
and so on.6−20 Thus, many research studies aim at tuning the luminescent properties
of YAG:Ce3+ because the luminescence of the Ce3+ ion can be strongly influenced by the crystal field splitting and
nephelauxetic effects,3 determined by the
adjustment of local structures through substitutions.21,22

Through various substitutions, a practical empirical rule has been formed, according to which substitutions
of the dodecahedral Y3+ by larger ions lead to the red
shift of the Ce3+ emission and substitutions of the octahedral
Al3+ by larger ions result in the blue shift.23 The spectral blue shift induced by larger ion
substitution of the octahedral Al3+ is easy to understand
and is ascribed to the expansion and reduced symmetry of dodecahedral
sites.24,25 However, the red shift of the spectra induced
by larger ion codoping YAG:Ce3+ is widely interpreted as
a result of local lattice compression on Ce3+–O2– bonds.26 Typically, Gd3+-codoped YAG:Ce3+ leading to
the red shift of the spectrum is confirmed by Chen et al.,27 whereas the mechanism of the blue shift of the
spectrum generated by smaller Lu3+ substituting Y3+ in YAG:Ce3+ is still unknown, the default being a result
of local lattice expansion on Ce3+–O2– bonds, opposite to the effect of Gd3+ substitution. Interestingly,
Muñoz-García et al. found that La3+ codoping
on the local structure around the Ce3+ ion produces an
overall anisotropic expansion instead of compression by first-principles
study.28 This calculated result clearly
points to the blue shift of the spectrum from the viewpoint of crystal
field theory.29 Recently, we have experimentally
observed the blue shift of the emission spectrum induced by La3+-codoped YAG:Ce3+ within its solubility.30 In fact, when Ca2+–Si4+ and Mg2+–Si4+ replace Y3+–Al3+, they induce
the spectral blue shift and red shift, respectively, also against
the empirical rule.13,31 Therefore, the complete correctness
of the empirical rule has been challenged, and we need more studies
that focus on local structures to draw a scientific conclusion.

In this regard and to have a better understanding on the luminescent
variations induced by ion substitutions, it is necessary to reveal
the mechanism of spectral blue shift induced by Lu3+ substitution
because Lu3+ is always an important and beneficial ion
for the design of stable and highly efficient garnet phosphor. Because
the local structural variations induced by ion doping in the dodecahedral
site of garnet are hard to be detected by traditional testing methods,
the first-principles calculation is preferentially adopted for this
study. In this article, the variations of local structure and electronic
structure induced by Lu3+ codoping in YAG:Ce3+ is first reported. The electronic structure is calculated using
HSE06 to obtain a reasonable band gap, which is essential to obtaining
an accurate location for the 4f and 5d levels of Ce3+.
The detailed theoretical methodology used in this work will be described
in the next section. The results of our calculations and main conclusions
are presented in Sections 3 and 4, respectively.

2 Computational Methods
Structural optimization calculations
of YAG, YAG:Ce, and Lu-codoped
YAG:Ce were performed by using the density functional theory (DFT)
method with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation
functional,32 as implemented in the VASP
package.33,34 The electronic properties were calculated
based on the optimized geometries using the hybrid HSE06 functional.35,36 The YAG host crystal was modeled by a unit cell containing 160 atoms,
in which one of the 24 Y atoms was replaced by a Ce atom, and on this
basis, another Y located at various distances from the Ce atom was
replaced by Lu. The Ce 5s25p64f15d16s2, Y 4s24p64d15s2, Lu 5s25p64f145d16s2, Al 3s23p1, and O 2s22p4 electrons were treated explicitly, and their
interactions with the cores were described by the projected augmented
wave method. The unit cell structures were fully optimized using the
conjugate gradient technique until the energy change was less than
10–5 eV and the Hellmann–Feynman forces on
atoms were less than 0.01 eV/Å. The planewave cutoff energy was
set to 500 eV, and a 4 × 4 × 4 k-point
mesh was used for sampling the Brillouin zone integrations.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Local Structure of Ce3+ in Lu3+-Doped YAG:Ce3+ by PBE Calculations
The
structure of pure YAG is optimized with the DFT–PBE method
(energy of YAG crystal as a function of lattice parameter is shown
in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information).
The optimized lattice parameters are a = b = c = 12.136 Å, which are slightly
higher (by 1.1%) than the experimental values (12.003 Å) due
to the inherent shortcomings of this calculation method.37 Our calculations performed for the Ce3+-doped YAG system (shown in Figure S1)
indicate that the lattice expansions induced by this small amount
of substitutions are negligible (by <0.1%), and to simplify the
calculations, a = b = c = 12.136 Å are fixed and adopted in all our calculations. To
confirm the optimal positions of Lu3+ in the YAG:Ce3+ double-substitution system, geometric optimization of seven
kinds of Lu3+–Ce3+ distances in YAG based
on the symmetry are performed with the DFT–PBE method (the
seven kinds of Lu3+ doping models are shown in Figure S2). The total free energy of the system
as a function of Lu3+–Ce3+ distances
is depicted in Figure 1. So, according to this calculation, it is preferable to separate
the Ce3+ and Lu3+ impurities at a certain distance
(at about 6.07 Å), which is different from the case of La3+–Ce3+-codoped YAG with optimized La3+–Ce3+ adjoining. This means that Lu3+ does not directly affect the first- and second-coordination
spheres by compression or expansion but indirectly affects the coordination
environment of Ce3+ through lattice stress.

Figure 1 Total free energy of
the Lu3+-codoped YAG:Ce3+ system as a function
of Lu3+–Ce3+.

Figure 2 shows
the
behavior of Lu3+ in seven possible kinds of substituted
Y3+ sites. As shown, Lu3+ shrinks the site,
irrespective of the kind of the substituted Y3+ site, due
to its relatively smaller ionic radii. The sites experience more distortion
when Lu3+ substitutes Y3+, because the shorter
bonds (bond IIS) present much larger compression than the
longer bonds (bond IL). Therefore, the difference between
the two kinds of bonds is enlarged, leading to severe distortion of
these sites. As the Lu3+-substituted sites exhibit shrinking,
is it possible to expand the Ce3+ site through lattice
stress?

Figure 2 Behavior of Lu3+ in seven possible kinds of substituted
Y3+ sites.

To answer this question, the variations of Ce3+–O2– bonds induced by Lu3+ substitution
are
shown in Figure 3.
To our surprise, the Ce3+–O2– bonds
experience more compression than expansion in most of the possible
sites, which means the shrinking of the Lu3+ site may force
lattice shrink and further compress the Ce3+ sites. This
result seems contradictory to the spectral blue shift. However, the
most stable Lu3+ site is located at a distance of about
6.07 Å from Ce3+. At this point, four Ce3+–O2– bonds experiencing expansion and the
other four experiencing compression in this site can be observed.
Moreover, the optimized first-coordination spheres around Ce3+ show that the shorter Ce3+–O2– bonds are extended and the longer Ce3+–O2– bonds shortened when Lu3+ is doped in YAG:Ce3+. This may result in a higher symmetry of the [CeO8] dodecahedron
and less distortion. To verify this conclusion, the distortion index, D, of the Ce3+ site is calculated through the
following equation38−40 1  where li is the distance from the
central atom to the ith coordinating atom, and lav is the
average bond length. The average Ce3+–O2– bond length lav, the associated standard
deviations, δ, and the distortion indexes, D, are listed in Table 1; the standard deviation is a measure of the asymmetry of the cation
site.41 As shown, the standard deviation
and distortion index are lowered with Lu3+ doped in YAG:Ce3+, which means a [CeO8] dodecahedron with higher
symmetry and less distortion is indeed formed in this Lu3+-codoped YAG:Ce3+ system. However, the average Ce3+–O2– bond length of Lu3+-codoped YAG:Ce3+ is slightly shorter than that of YAG:Ce3+. To eliminate the influence of the fastening lattice parameter,
a full relaxation of Lu3+-doped YAG:Ce3+ was
performed. The results (presented in Figure S3 and Table S1) also showed that the average Ce3+–O2– bond length compression and less distortion of the
Ce3+ site is consistent with the result of fastening lattice
parameters. As we know, the effect of Ce3+–O2– bond compression and less distortion is opposite,
and thus we can deduce that the site symmetry shows a larger influence
on the photoluminescence spectrum than the Ce3+–O2– bond length. This may be the reason for the special
empirical rule, that is substitutions of the dodecahedral Y3+ by larger ions lead to spectral red shift and smaller ions lead
to blue shift for most of the YAG:Ce3+ modification system.
Therefore, the origin of the spectral blue shift in the crystal structure
of Lu3+-doped YAG:Ce3+ should be ascribed to
the higher symmetry of [CeO8] dodecahedron and less distortion,
but how the doped Lu3+ affects the distribution of Ce3+ energy levels depends on further electronic structure study.

3.2 Electronic Structure of Lu3+-Doped
YAG:Ce3+ by HSE06 Calculations
Based on the optimized
geometries, the electronic structures of YAG, YAG:Ce3+ and
(Y,Lu)AG:Ce3+ are calculated by the hybrid HSE06 functional
method (setting the top of the valence band as 0 eV). According to
the calculated densities of states (DOSs) of YAG (shown in Figure 4), the band gap of
YAG is about 5.77 eV, which is 0.73 eV lower than the measured optical
band gap of 6.5 eV.42 We consider this
result reasonable because a similar one is found in many other oxides
such as In2O3, SnO2, Cd2SnO4, and so forth, due to the same parity of wave function
at the band edge, which forbids the optical transitions at the band
edge state.43 Typically, the optical band
gap is found to be 0.8 eV higher than the fundamental band gap in
In2O3.43 The highly
symmetric YAG may be in the same situation, which needs further work
to be confirmed. Besides, the obtained band gap is higher than 4.71
and 5.0 eV, calculated by Xu et al. and Muñoz-García
et al., respectively, using local density approximation and generalized
gradient approximation (GGA) approaches.44,45 The valence band of YAG is mainly composed of 2p of O2–, and the conduction band is composed of 4d of Y3+. Weak
hybridization between 2p of O2– and 4d of Y3+ can be detected both in the valence and conduction bands,
which may provide a channel for electron immigration in the process
of thermal or photoionization, consistent with the experimental phenomena
observed by Ueda et al.46

Figure 4 DOSs of YAG.

Figure 5 presents
the DOS of YAG:Ce3+ by comparing the electronic structure
with that of YAG. Small amounts of Ce3+ doping did not
generate significant changes in the total DOS, except for several
partial DOSs (PDOSs) of Ce3+ distributed between the top
of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band in the range
of −10 to 15 eV. Within this range, the 4f of Ce3+ is located at about 3.4 eV above the top of the valence band, whereas
the 5d energy level of Ce3+ is located in the conduction
band and shows a slightly higher energy level than 4d of Y3+. This is always the case in many ground-state calculations related
to rare earth-activated luminescent materials.47−49 We consider
this reasonable because the 5d of Ce3+ has a higher energy
level than 4d of Y3+ due to its relatively lower electronegativity,
which means lesser ability to bind to the outer electron; therefore,
the 5d ground state of Ce3+ set into the conduction band
is an intrinsic phenomenon of YAG:Ce3+ phosphor and its
modified system in almost all ground-state calculations. Additionally,
the 5d orbit is empty for Ce3+, and it is reasonable for
this unoccupied orbit to be set into the conduction band. To set the
5d of Ce3+ inside the band gap, Jia et al. artificially
moved an electron from the 4f to 5d orbit; thus, the partially occupied
5d level descended somewhat separated from the conduction band,50,51 which is beyond the scope of this article. We have obtained a relatively
accurate location of the 4f and 5d states of Ce3+ in terms
of the ground-state calculation. The 4f → 5d transition can
be assigned to the peaks starting at 3.44–6.24 eV, and the
energy difference corresponding to the 442 nm excitation wavelength
approximates to the experimental 455 nm,2,18 which further
confirms that the locations of the 4f and 5d states of Ce3+ are reasonable and a higher precision can be achieved than the GGA
or CASTP2 calculations performed by Muñoz-García et
al.23,52

Figure 5 DOSs of YAG:Ce3+.

Based on the relatively reasonable calculated band
gap and locations
of the 4f and 5d states of Ce3+, it is possible to observe
the effect of Lu3+ on DOS of (Y,Lu)AG:Ce3+ (shown
in Figure 6). As shown,
the fully filled 4f orbit of Lu3+ is set into the valence
band, whereas the 5d state of Lu3+ presents a slightly
higher energy than 4d of Y3+, which may influence the top
of the valence band and bottom of the conduction band, respectively.
Compared with YAG:Ce3+, the band gap shows a slight enlargement
by about 0.03 eV. The PDOS of Al3+ and O2– nearly have no change with Lu3+ codoping but the PDOS
of Y3+ is changed with the 4d state extending toward high
energy, which can be identified from the comparison of total DOS in Figure S4. This extension of the conduction band
reflects the fact that the electrons will have a larger nonlocalization,27 which is very likely to affect the 4f and 5d
states of Ce3+. In this Lu3+-codoped phosphor,
it is hard to observe the energy shift at the 5d state but a detectable
(about 0.05 eV) energy shift toward lower energy at the 4f state is
observed (shown in Figure S5), which should
be responsible for the spectral blue shift. The 4f → 5d transition
of Lu3+-codoped YAG:Ce3+ can be assigned to
the peaks starting at 3.39–6.24 eV, corresponding to the 435
nm excitation wavelength. This value is reasonable and matches with
the experimentally obtained data well.8 However, it is difficult to understand the 4f energy level of Ce3+ in Lu3+-codoped YAG:Ce3+ shifting
toward lower energy compared to that of YAG:Ce3+ because
the inner 4f state is hardly affected by the coordination environment.
It should be noted that the energy of DOS in this calculation is based
on setting the top of the valence band to 0 eV. We also found that
the Fermi energy level of Lu3+-codoped YAG:Ce3+ is lowered by 0.05 eV than that of YAG:Ce3+. Thus, if
we set the Fermi energy level to 0 eV, the 4f state should be located
at the same energy level, whereas the 5d energy levels of Lu3+-doped YAG:Ce3+ should be located at higher energy levels
than those of YAG:Ce3+. In this case, we can infer that
the energy shift toward the higher energy of 5d state induced by Lu3+-codoped YAG:Ce3+ is the origin of the spectral
blue shift in energy level distribution. Generally, it is easier for
the 5d of Ce3+ to be affected by the coordination environment
than 4f and thus the reduced distortion of the [CeO8] dodecahedron
should be responsible for the energy shift toward the higher energy
of the 5d state. Besides, no matter what arguments are presented,
the enlarged energy
difference of 4f and 5d objectively exists, and this should be the
origin of the spectral blue shift in energy level distribution.

4 Conclusions
In summary, the origin
of the spectral blue shift induced by Lu3+-codoped YAG:Ce3+ is investigated by the local
and electronic structures study using the PBE and HSE06 functions,
respectively. The optimized first-coordination spheres around Ce3+ shows that the shorter Ce3+–O2– bonds were extended and the longer Ce3+–O2– bonds shortened when Lu3+ was doped in
YAG:Ce3+, resulting in a higher symmetry of [CeO8] dodecahedron and less distortion, which is further confirmed by
standard deviation and distortion index calculation. This should be
the origin of the spectral blue shift in the crystal structure from
the viewpoint of crystal field theory. The presented electronic structure
calculated by the HSE06 function method shows reasonable band gaps
and locations of the 4f and 5d states of Ce3+. By comparison,
the enlarged energy difference of 4f and 5d induced by Lu3+-codoped YAG:Ce3+ should be the origin of the spectral
blue shift in energy level distribution.
