Parkinson’s
disease (PD), an age-related neurodegenerative disorder that results from a progressive loss of
dopaminergic neurons has an enormous economical and human cost. Unfortunately,
only symptomatic treatment such as dopamine replacement therapy is
available. Therefore, drugs with new mechanisms of action able to
protect against neuronal cell death are an urgent need. We here report
the in vivo efficacy on dopaminergic neuronal protection in a PD mouse
model and the lack of toxicity in zebrafish and Ames test of benzothiazole-based
casein kinase-1δ (CK-1δ) nanomolar inhibitors. On the
basis of these results, we propose protein kinase
CK-1δ inhibitors as the possible disease-modifying drugs for
PD, benzothiazole 4 being a promising drug candidate
for further development as a new therapy of this neurodegenerative
disease.

Introduction
Parkinson’s
disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative
disorder after Alzheimer’s disease. It is characterized by
diverse motor symptoms (tremor, bradykinesia or slowness of movement,
and rigidity or stiffness) and cognitive decline (hallucinations and
dementia). These symptoms appear as direct consequence of a dopamine
deficit in the nigrostriatal brain region due to the loss of dopamine-producing
neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Intracellular
α-synuclein inclusions called Lewy bodies and dystrophic neurites
are other prominent neuropathological hallmarks.1,2 The
incidence of PD in the general population increases
with age, and around 1–2% of those over 65 years of age suffer
from this disorder, with more than 3 million patients currently diagnosed.3 As the global life expectancy grows, a twofold
increase in PD is expected by 2030.4 The
discovery in the 1960s that the selective loss of dopaminergic neurons
was the main cause of PD directed the pharmacological therapies toward
neurotransmitters replacement drugs, such as the dopamine precursor
levodopa, which is currently the standard clinical treatment. However,
levodopa treatment is only effective during a limited period. Eventually,
other motor symptoms, including dyskinesias, are experienced by PD
patients as the disease progresses and the number of the remaining
dopaminergic neurons decrease.5 Currently,
there is no cure for PD and novel effective drug treatments for this
devastating disease are urgently needed. Mainly drugs that control
the motor and nonmotor symptoms of the pathology, as well as enable
the protection of the dopaminergic neurons from progressive death,
are highly desirable. Although the important role of casein kinase-1
(CK-1) in different neurodegenerative diseases6 and the association of this protein kinase in the phosphorylation
of α-synuclein7 has been previously
described,7 in this work, we report for
the first time the discovery of δ isoform of CK-1 (CK-1δ)
as a potential neuroprotective target for the treatment of PD and
the value of benzothiazole-based CK-1δ inhibitors as the new
drug candidates for a future disease-modifying treatment of this pathology,
as they show dopaminergic neuroprotection in vivo.

Results and Discussion
First, to check if SH-SY5Y cell line expressed CK-1δ, we
performed the Western blot and immunocytochemistry analyses using
a specific anti-CK-1δ antibody (Figure 1S). Results showed that CK-1δ protein is not only present in
this cell line, but more interestingly, CK-1δ levels are increased
after the treatment with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). These results
suggest the involvement of CK-1δ in PD. For this reason we selected
some of the N-(benzothiazolyl)-2-phenylacetamides
derivatives (1–7) previously described by our
group as the nanomolar CK-1δ inhibitors8 (Table 1). To further
characterize the pharmacological activity of these selective inhibitors,
we evaluated them in different cellular models. The biological relevance
of CK-1δ as novel neuroprotective drug candidates for PD was
assessed using the SH-SY5Y dopaminergic cell line using the neurotoxin
(6-OHDA) to induce the cell death. Thus, before 6-OHDA exposure, cells
were pretreated with different doses (0.1–20 μM) of the
CK-1δ inhibitors (1–7) for 1 h (Figure 2S). Cell viability was analyzed 24 h
later. Although treatment of this cell line with 6-OHDA induced a
substantial cell death (more than 40%, dotted line in the figure),
the addition of these compounds triggered a neuroprotection against
6-OHDA in a dose-dependent manner, with the best effects at 10 μM
(Figure 1). It is worth
mentioning that the cell activity of a new compound is not only based
on its evidence in vitro target activity or potency but also on the
different drug-like properties such as solubility or absorption that
finally determine the rate of compound penetration inside the cell
such as compound 6, for which no neuroprotection was
observed at different doses (Figure 2S).
Thus, although IC50 values against CK-1δ of the tested
compounds are in the same range, the cell neuroprotection values show
some differences among the evaluated derivatives, with compound 4 being the most potent. Altogether, the present data confirm
that N-(benzothiazolyl)-2-phenylacetamides protect
dopaminergic neuronal cell death from 6-OHDA toxicity, where CK-1δ
may be the pharmacological target involved.

24 h to 6-OHDA (35 μM) in the presence or absence of the CK-1δ
inhibitors (10 μM) (A) and compound 4 (0.1–20
μM) (B). The number of viable cells was measured by (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide) assay. Each data point represents the mean ± SD of six

Compounds (1–7) were then evaluated as anti-inflammatory
agents, as it is well known that neuroinflammation underlies many
neurodegenerative diseases, including PD.9 To produce the inflammatory activation in astrocytes and microglia
(primary cultures), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was employed. The inflammatory
reaction was measured by nitrite production using the well-established
Griess methodology. Cultures were incubated with different concentrations
(0.1–20 μM) of the different CK-1δ inhibitors for
1 h and then cells were cultured for another 24 h in the presence
of LPS (Figure 3S). A significant induction
of nitrite production in the culture medium of astrocytes and microglial
cells (4- and 2.5-fold, respectively) was observed when primary cells
were stimulated with LPS. This effect was significantly diminished
by CK-1δ inhibitors in a dose-dependent manner. The 10 μM
dose is the most effective form of treatment (Figure 2). Given the in vitro results showing a neuroprotective
and anti-inflammatory action of CK-1δ inhibitors, we next assessed
the efficacy of one of the most potent, selective, and neuroprotective
CK-1δ inhibitor in the 6-OHDA model, derivative 4, in a rodent model of PD. To this end, we analyzed whether compound 4 administered in vivo affected the dopaminergic cell loss
in the SNpc as well as glial activation. Adult rats were injected
unilaterally with LPS into the SNpc. This injection into the SNpc
of the rodents produces the activation of microglial cells with a
release of neurotoxic factors leading to dopaminergic cell death.10

on the glial primary cultures. Astrocytes (A, C) and microglial cells
(B, D) cultures were isolated, plated, and later treated with lipopolysaccharide
(LPS, 10 μg/mL) in the presence of the different CK-1δ
inhibitors (10 μM) and compound 4 (0.1–20
μM). The production of nitrite was measured by the Griess reaction.

and LPS-treated cultures.

The results obtained from the fluorescence immunohistochemical
analysis of LPS-lesioned animal brains indicated a substantial neuronal
death in the SNpc of these animals (Figure 3). The administration of compound 4 directly into the brain together with LPS resulted in a significant
protection of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive cells against the
LPS-induced damage, compared with the abundant dopaminergic neuronal
loss observed in the lesioned animals.

(LPS, 10 μg) was injected unilaterally
into the adult substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) of adult rats
together with the CK-1δ inhibitor 4 (15 nmol).
Control animals were injected with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
After 72 h, the brains were removed and sections processed for immunodetection
of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and inflammatory markers. (A) Double

(TH, red) in SNpc (injected and contralateral hemispheres, as control,
are shown). When LPS is administrated, a decrease in the number of
dopaminergic neurons and an increase in astrocytosis are observed.
These facts are abolished when the CK-1 inhibitor (compound 4) is administrated. (B) Immunostaining showing the expression

activation. Scale bar, 200 μm.

N-(Benzothiazolyl)-2-phenylacetamide 4 is an important lead compound that targets CK-1δ with
an IC50 value of 23 nM and shows neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory
properties both in cell cultures and in animal models. To confirm
this lead compound as a drug candidate for further in vivo studies
after systemic administration, we look for several drug-like properties
of this CK-1δ inhibitor. To become a drug for the treatment
of a neurological disorder, it is absolutely necessary that the compound
crosses the blood–brain barrier, being safe and nonmutagenic.
Moreover, the compound should be orally bioavailable to be further
developed as an oral medication. Previous in vivo pharmacokinetics
results showed that this compound was able to penetrate into the brain
by oral absorption and intraperitoneal injection.11 To assess the safety of the CK-1δ inhibitor 4, two experiments were done. First, and taking into account
that more than 70% of human genes have their corresponding genes in
the zebrafish (Danio rerio),12 we employed them as a useful pharmacological
tool for biosafety studies. In fact, it has been used extensively
for testing toxicity in the whole organism.13 Different readouts are considered, the zebrafish tail being one
of them. The tail is crooked when the tested compound has toxic properties
for the zebrafish embryo development. Thus, to assess the safety of
the CK-1δ inhibitor 4, which has shown good results
in the protection of dopaminergic neurons in mice brains, we tested
this compound at different concentrations (0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10,
and 20 μM) in the zebrafish embryos. We performed the assay
by triplicate and used 10 embryos per compound concentration. The
results are depicted in Figure 4S, showing
a safe therapeutic window for compound 4 in a range of
concentration between 0.5 and 10 μM.

Additionally, we
evaluated the in vitro mutagenic and genotoxic
potential using the well-known Ames test.14 A positive result indicates that the chemical is mutagenic and may
be carcinogen, ruling out any possibilities for further development.
Compound 4 was examined for its ability to produce and/or
revert mutations in the bacterial assay conducted without the metabolic
activation using two Salmonella typhimurium strains, such as TA100 and TA98. We used two positive controls,
sodium azide and 2-nitrofluorene (2-NF), which are suspected to be
carcinogenic agents (Table 2).

All of the tested concentrations of derivative 4 (20–0.5
μM) were found to be not mutagenic in the absence of S9 metabolic
activation, as the numbers of positive wells in the treated plates
were not statistically different from those obtained in the background
plates for both S. typhimurium strains
TA98 and TA100.

Consequently, the results obtained under the
experimental conditions
used in the present study provide the evidence that compound 4 is not mutagenic, giving the green light for further pharmaceutical
development.

Conclusions
We have discovered that
targeting the protein kinase CK-1δ
may be a new mechanism of action to modulate the death of dopaminergic
neurons. Thus, benzothiazole-based CK-1δ inhibitors may be promising
compounds for the PD treatment with very potent neuroprotective and
anti-inflammatory activity both in in vitro and in vivo models of
PD. Moreover, we have shown for the first time that CK-1δ is
involved in the activation of inflammatory cell response to LPS, its
inhibitors being good modulators of this pathological process. The
selection of benzothiazole 4 as the drug candidate was
done based on the in vivo data of efficacy and safety properties.
Thus, we can summarize that CK-1δ inhibitor 4 is
a small molecule with an IC50 of 23 nM and is able to protect
the death of dopaminergic in vivo neurons induced by 6-OHDA and to
decrease the inflammatory activation by LPS in the primary cell cultures
of astrocytes and microglia. Moreover, this compound is not toxic
in a zebrafish model, having a negative Ames test. Further studies
are in progress to show the efficacy of this new compound in the well-established
models of PD (6-OHDA) and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
(MPTP) after chronic oral administration. Altogether, the present
data led us to propose N-(benzothiazolyl)-2-phenylacetamide
inhibitor 4, a selective CK-1δ inhibitor, as a
lead compound for further pharmacological development in the search
of future disease-modifying drugs for Parkinson’s disease.

Experimental
Section
Protein Kinase CK-1δ Expression in Human Dopaminergic
SH-SY5Y Cell Line
Neuronal Cell Culture
The human
dopaminergic SH-SY5Y
cell line was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and propagated in F12 medium/Eagle’s
Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM) containing glutamine (2 mM), 1% of
nonessential amino acids, and 15% of fetal bovine serum under humidified
5% CO2 and 95% air. The human recombinant casein kinase-1δ
was purchased from Millipore (Millipore Iberica S.A.U.).

Immunocytochemistry
The cultures were processed immunocytochemically
as previously described.15 In brief, after
1 h incubation with a rabbit anti-CK-1δ primary antibody (Thermo
Scientific Pierce), the cells were washed with PBS and incubated with
an AlexaFluor-488 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes)
for 45 min at 37 °C. Later, the images were obtained using a
LSM710 laser scanning spectral confocal microscope (Zeiss). Confocal
microscope settings were adjusted to produce the optimum signal-to-noise
ratio. The staining of the nuclei was performed using 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole.

Immunoblot Analysis
Proteins were isolated from basal
and 6-OHDA-treated SH-SY5Y cell cultures by standard methods. The
total protein extraction and Western blot analysis were performed
as previously described.16

On attaining semiconfluence,
the SH-SY5Y cells were treated with 6-OHDA (35 μM, Sigma) for
24 h. Some cultures were pretreated for 1 h with the different compounds
at 0.1, 0.5, 1, 10, and 20 μM. After the treatment, cultures
were processed for cell viability as previously described.17

described.16,17 The cultures were pretreated
with the different CK-1δ inhibitors (0.1, 0.5, 1, 10, and 20
μM) 1 h before exposure to LPS (10 μg ml–1), and nitrites production was measured after 24 h in the culture.

In Vivo Neuroprotective and Anti-Inflammatory Effect
Animal Experiments
Adult male Wistar rats (8–12
weeks old) were used in this study. All of the procedures with animals
were in accordance with the protocols issued, which followed the National
(normative 53/2013) and International recommendations (normative 2010/63
from the European Communities Council). Adequate measures were taken
to minimize pain or discomfort of the animals.

LPS was injected
in vivo. The animals were divided into three groups, with at least
four rats in each group, properly anesthetized, and placed in a stereotaxic
apparatus (Kopf Instruments, CA). LPS (10 μg in 2.5 μL
PBS) alone or in combination with compound 4 (15 nmol)
was injected into the right side of the SNpc (coordinates from Bregma:
posterior −4.8 mm; lateral +2.0 mm; ventral: +8.2 mm, according
to the atlas of Paxinos and Watson). The dose of LPS was chosen on
the basis of previous published data.16

Histology and Immunohistochemistry
The animals previously
anesthetized were perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde
and the brains obtained as previously described.16,18
