Cosolvents play an important role
in regulating the stability and
function of proteins present in the cell. We studied the role of cosolvents,
urea and guanidinium chloride (GdmCl), which act as protein denaturants,
in the catalytic activity and structural stability of the protein
lysozyme using activity measurements, spectroscopy, and molecular
dynamics simulations. We find that the activity of lysozyme increases
on the addition of urea, whereas it decreases sharply on the addition
of GdmCl. At low GdmCl concentrations ([GdmCl] < 4 M), the activity
of lysozyme decreases, even though there is no significant perturbation
in the structure of the lysozyme folded state. We find that this is
due to the strong interaction of the Gdm+ ion with the
residues Asp52 and Glu35, which are present in the lysozyme catalytic
site. In contrast, urea interacts with Trp63 present in the loop region
present near the active site of lysozyme, inducing minor conformational
changes in lysozyme, which can increase the activity of lysozyme.
At higher denaturant concentrations, experiments show that GdmCl completely
denatures the protein, whereas the folded state is stable in the presence
of urea. We further show that GdmCl denatures lysozyme with the disulfide
bonds intact in the protein, whereas urea denatures the protein only
when the disulfide bonds are broken using reducing agents.

Introduction
To
investigate the mechanism of protein folding, the native folded
structure of proteins is perturbed using chemical denaturants in addition
to temperature and force.1−5 Urea and guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) are the most commonly used
chemical denaturants.6−15 To contrast the denaturing mechanisms of urea and GdmCl, we studied
the unfolding and enzymatic activity of a very important protein,
lysozyme, in the presence of urea and GdmCl. Lysozyme is a 129-residue
protein16 possessing antibacterial activity.17 It catalyzes hydrolysis of peptidoglycan, which
acts as the backbone for bacterial cell wall.18,19 The bacterial cell wall components bind to the active site in lysozyme
to form enzyme–substrate complexes. The residues Asp52 and
Glu35, present in the active site of lysozyme, are found to play an
important role in the catalysis mechanism.16,18,20 The side chains of the catalytic residues
Asp52 and Glu35 preferentially cleave the glycosidic bond connecting
the two saccharide rings present in the substrate (Figure S1).18−20 The hen egg white lysozyme (Protein Data Bank (PDB)
ID: 1AKI)21 in the folded state contains four disulfide
bonds, two β sheets, and an α-helix core composed of five
helices, which are more than five-residue long, in addition to small
helices21 (Figure 1). The disulfide bonds enhance the stability
of the folded state of the protein.

Figure 1 Crystal structure of lysozyme in the folded
state (PDB ID:1AKI21). The β-sheets and helices are
shown in blue and
red, respectively. The unstructured part of the protein is shown as
a gray coil. Four disulfide bonds are shown in yellow.

Even though lysozyme is the first biological enzyme
whose structure
is known, there are a few experimental22−25 studies on the denaturation of
lysozyme in physiological conditions. The main objective of this study
is to analyze the effect of urea and GdmCl on lysozyme at neutral
pH and in the absence of reducing agents. Experiments show that at
neutral pH urea can denature lysozyme only when the disulfide bonds
are broken by adding reducing agents like dithiothreitol.26,27 In neutral conditions, no significant structural change in the protein
is observed when urea is added to the solution, whereas complete protein
unfolding is observed when GdmCl is used as a denaturant.22−25 A comprehensive understanding of chemical denaturation of lysozyme
by urea and GdmCl is still elusive, and the role of disulfide bonds
in lysozyme unfolding in the presence of denaturants is unclear.

In this article, we have used spectroscopic measurements and molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations to understand the effect of denaturants,
urea and GdmCl, on the activity and denaturation of lysozyme. Analysis
of experiments and simulations shows that urea does not unfold lysozyme
at neutral pH and in the absence of reducing agents when the disulfide
bonds are intact. The activity of lysozyme does not decrease at all
in these conditions. In reducing conditions, when the disulfide bonds
are broken, the activity of lysozyme decreases with the urea concentration
and also the tertiary structure falls apart, linking the activity
of lysozyme with the folded structure. However, in the presence of
low GdmCl concentration and in close-to-neutral pH conditions, the
activity of lysozyme decreases, but this is primarily due to the strong
binding of the Gdm+ ion with the catalytic residues Asp52
and Glu35 in the active region of lysozyme. At high GdmCl concentrations,
the activity falls sharply due to both the interaction of Gdm+ ion with the catalytic residues and also due to the breakdown
in the folded structure. GdmCl unfolds lysozyme without the addition
of reducing agents, and the disulfide bonds are intact in the denatured
ensemble of lysozyme obtained by adding GdmCl.

Experimental and Computational
Methods
Materials
Lysozyme and Micrococcus lysodeikticus were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Urea (99% purity) and GdmCl (99.8%
purity) were purchased from Spectro-Chem (India) and Merck, respectively.
Purified water (H2O, Millipore, resistivity: 18.2 MΩ
cm) is used to make different samples.

Activity Measurements
Lysozyme activity is determined
according to the following enzymatic assay. Aliquots (∼100
μL) of the samples containing 200–400 units/mL of lysozyme
are added to 1.4 mL of a ∼0.015% (w/w) suspension of M. lysodeikticus in a phosphate buffer of pH 6.24.
The protein activity is measured by monitoring the decrease in the
absorbance at λ = 450 nm (Thermo Fischer Scientific Evolution
201 spectrophotometer) at 25 °C due to the lysis of M. lysodeikticus cells (the measured absorbance is
corrected by the absorbance of pure phosphate buffer, pH 6.24). The
activity measurements have been performed 10 times to check the reliability
and reproducibility of the data.

Spectroscopic Measurements
Steady-state fluorescence
study is performed at 25 °C using a HORIBA JOBIN YVON Fluoromax-4
spectrofluorometer. The lysozyme (∼10 μM) samples are
prepared in a buffer of pH 7 (25 mM Tris–HCl, 150 mM NaCl)
containing 0–8 M urea and GdmCl solutions, respectively. The
excitation wavelength at 280 nm with slit width of both the excitation
and emission are at 2 nm. Circular dichroism
(CD) spectra are recorded on a JASCO J-815 CD spectrometer (model
number J-815-1505) using 28 ± 1 μM lysozyme for the far-UV
(180–260 nm) and 80 ± 1 μM lysozyme for the near-UV
region (260–330 nm). We have also calculated mean residue ellipticity
(MRE) for both the bands of the CD spectra in the far-UV region.

Molecular Dynamics Simulations
We have performed molecular
dynamics simulations to study the effect of denaturants, urea and
GdmCl, on the stability of lysozyme. The initial protein conformations
to start the simulations are generated using the crystal21 structure of lysozyme (PDB ID: 1AKI) (Figure 1). The simulations are performed
using the GROMACS molecular dynamics (MD) simulation package28 and optimized potential for liquid simulations
(OPLS) all-atom force field.29,30 The SPC/E water model
is used to mimic the interaction of water with the protein.31 The force-field parameters derived using the
Kirkwood–Buff equations by Weerasinghe and Smith are used for
urea and GdmCl molecules32,33 (see the Supporting
Information (SI), Figures S2, S3 and Table S1). The simulation cell is a cubic box, and periodic boundary condition
is applied in the x, y, and z directions. The desired urea or GdmCl concentration is
achieved by randomly inserting the required number of denaturant molecules
in the simulation box with the protein, and finally, the box is solvated
with water. The initial configuration is minimized using the steepest-descent
method to remove unfavorable interactions between atoms. After minimization,
the system is equilibrated for 1 ns by applying harmonic constraints
to the heavy atoms of the protein. To dissect the role of disulfide
bonds in the stability of the protein, we also performed simulations
with and without the disulfide linkages starting from the protein
crystal structure. Simulations are performed in the NPT ensemble.
The temperature, T, and pressure, P, of the simulation box are maintained at 300 K (or 325 K) and 1
bar, respectively, using the modified Berendsen thermostat,34 which is a stochastic velocity rescaling method35 with a time constant of 0.1 ps, and Parrinello–Rahman
barostat36 with a time constant of 2 ps.
The isothermal compressibility of the system is set to 4.5 ×
10–5 bar–1. The nonbonded interactions
between pairs of atoms are calculated according to the Verlet cut-off
scheme.37 Short-range van der Waals and
electrostatic interactions are truncated at 10 Å. Long-range
electrostatic interactions are calculated using the particle mesh
Ewald method, with a grid size of 1.6 Å.38 All of the covalent bonds are kept rigid using the LINCS algorithm,39 and a time step of 2 fs is used to integrate
the equations of motion.

Urea and GdmCl Force Field
The force
field derived
by Weerasinghe et al. is used in the current study for urea33 and GdmCl32 along
with the SPC/E water model.31 The force
field is parameterized to reproduce the experimental density and Kirkwood–Buff
integrals40 as a function of composition.
The computed surface tension of water/urea solutions using this force
field is in good agreement with the experimental values,41 and these force fields are found to be reasonable
to model urea41−57and GdmCl54,56,58−60 denaturant effects in protein folding. We performed
a simulation of 8 M urea and 6 M GdmCl solution in a 40 Å water
box in the NPT ensemble. All of the other simulation parameters and
conditions are described in the section above. The radial distribution
functions and first shell coordination numbers computed from the simulation
are in agreement with the earlier reported values32,33 (Figures S2, S3, and Table S1).

Data Analysis
The spatial density maps are computed
using the volmap plugin in the Visual Molecular Dynamics package.61 The space around the protein residues is divided
into a grid of size 0.1 Å.29 The grid
points take the values 0 or 1, depending on the occupancy of atoms.
The central carbon atom in urea or Gdm+ is treated as a
sphere of radius equal to its van der Waals radius. A grid point is
considered to be occupied if the sphere lies on the grid. The value
at a grid point is averaged over multiple simulation frames. The radius
of gyration (Rg) of the protein is calculated
to estimate its size using the following equation  where  is the vector connecting
the atom i to the geometric center of the protein.
The hydrogen bond
is defined to exist between two atoms if the distance between the
donor atom (O or N) and the acceptor atom (O or N) is less than 3.5
Å and the angle between the donor, hydrogen, and acceptor atoms
is greater than 135°. To compute the contact number between the
denaturant and protein, a contact is defined to exist when any atom
of the denaturant is within 5 Å of any atom of the protein residues.

Results and Discussion
The enzymatic activity of lysozyme
as a function of time for different
concentrations of urea and GdmCl solutions is shown in Figure 2. The dotted line in both the
figure panels corresponds to the control experiment when lysozyme
is not present in the cell suspension, whereas the solid lines show
the activity of lysozyme with different concentrations of denaturants
in the cell suspension. The enzymatic activity data clearly shows
that the activity of lysozyme increases with the addition of urea,
whereas it decreases monotonically with the addition of GdmCl compared
with the native condition (Figure 2). The increase in the activity of lysozyme induced
by urea is ∼20%, and it is reproduced in multiple experiments,
whereas the activity of lysozyme decreases sharply in the presence
of GdmCl and is almost lost completely above 4.0 M GdmCl. The enzymatic
activity data clearly suggests that the structural changes induced
by urea and GdmCl in lysozyme are drastically different. The activity
of lysozyme depends on the binding of the cell (substrate) to the
active region of lysozyme, as shown in Figure S1. Both the availability of the active residues and the structural
integrity of the protein will affect the binding. The change in activity
data suggests that GdmCl interacts with the residues present in the
active core region of the lysozyme, whereas urea does not directly
interact with the residues in the active region. Urea probably enhances
the interaction of Asp52 and Glu35 with the substrate, which can contribute
to the slightly enhanced activity of lysozyme.

Figure 2 Time-dependent enzymatic
activity of lysozyme in solutions having
different concentrations of urea (a) and GdmCl (b). The dotted line
in both the panels corresponds to the control experiment, which is
performed in the absence of lysozyme in the cell suspension.

To understand the structural changes
in lysozyme induced by urea
and GdmCl, we have measured the CD spectra of lysozyme in far- and
near-UV regions representing the secondary and tertiary structures
of proteins, as shown in Figure 3. The protein shows two bands centered at around 210–219
and 222–232 nm corresponding to the β-sheet and α-helix
structures, respectively. On addition of urea and GdmCl, the peak
position of the bands centered at ∼210 nm gets shifted. Hence,
we have considered the ellipticity of the peak maxima of the two bands
to assess the change in the ellipticity of the bands centered at 210–219
and 222–232 nm regions. On addition of urea, ellipticity of
the first band decreases slightly, whereas it increases marginally
for the second band at ∼222 nm (inset of Figure 3a,b), indicating the decrease in β-sheet
content on addition of urea (the mean residue ellipticity (MRE) at
peak maxima of two bands is shown in Figure S4, which follows the same behavior). Unlike the case for urea, the
ellipticity of both the bands decreases sharply with the addition
of GdmCl compared with the native structure, indicating that the secondary
structure of lysozyme changes markedly in the presence of GdmCl. Figure 3c,d shows the CD
spectra of lysozyme in the tertiary region (contribution from the
tryptophan as well as the disulfide bonds) in the presence of different
concentrations of urea and GdmCl, respectively. The ellipticity of
the tryptophan residue at 293 nm increases with the addition of urea
(Figure 3c), whereas
it decreases sharply with the addition of GdmCl and is ∼0 in
4 M GdmCl solution (Figure 3d). The CD data in the tryptophan region indicates that the
exposure to and interaction of tryptophan residues with urea and GdmCl
are completely different. The CD data of lysozyme in far- and near-UV
regions clearly show that the addition of ∼4.0 M GdmCl unfolds
lysozyme by drastically decreasing the secondary and tertiary structures,
leading to the complete loss of its enzymatic activity. Unlike GdmCl,
urea does not significantly perturb the secondary structure and increases
the ellipticity in the tertiary region, which probably increases its
enzymatic activity.

Figure 3 Far-UV (upper panels) and near-UV (lower panels) CD spectra
of
lysozyme in urea (a and c) and GdmCl (b and d). Ellipticity changes
at the peak maxima of the bands in the ranges of 210–218 and
222–225 nm and at 293 nm with the addition of urea (black)
and GdmCl (red) are shown in the insets of (a), (b), and (d), respectively.

We have also measured the intrinsic
fluorescence of lysozyme in
different concentrations of urea (Figure 4a) and GdmCl (Figure 4b) to understand the local solvent environment
around the tryptophan residues and its effect on folding. The native
form of lysozyme shows emission maxima (λmax) at
335 nm (black line, Figure 4a,b), and with the addition of urea, the change in λmax is not prominent and is almost constant within the experimental
uncertainty (Figure 4c). In contrast to urea, λmax of lysozyme is constant
up to 3 M GdmCl, and after that, it gets red-shifted ∼10 nm
sharply up to 6 M and then becomes constant (Figure 4c). The change in λmax on
addition of GdmCl follows a sigmoidal-shaped curve, which is trademark
of protein denaturation. It is clear from this plot that lysozyme
completely denatures when GdmCl concentration is greater than 4.0
M. The fluorescence intensity of lysozyme decreased on addition of
urea, whereas it increased with the addition of GdmCl (Figure 4d). Lysozyme has six tryptophan
residues, of which Trp62, Trp63, and Trp108 residues contribute prominently
to the intrinsic fluorescence in the native form of lysozyme. Trp62
and Trp63 are in the irregular loop region and solvent-exposed, whereas
Trp108 is buried in the active core region of lysozyme. The trend
of λmax as well as the change in the emission intensity
data clearly indicates that the addition of urea does not significantly
perturb the polarity of the local environment. However, in the case
of GdmCl (∼4 M), Trp108 is highly exposed to GdmCl/water and
realizes more polar surroundings (Figure S5). The experimental data clearly suggests that the interactions of
urea and GdmCl and their mechanisms of inducing structural change
in lysozyme are distinctly different.

We performed MD simulations to understand the effects of
urea and
GdmCl on the activity of and structural changes in lysozyme. There
is a substantial decrease in the activity of lysozyme when the concentration
of GdmCl is less than 4.0 M (Figure 2), even though significant structural changes are not
observed (Figure 4c,d).
We computed the spatial density distribution of Gdm+ and
urea within 5 Å of the protein (Figure 5a,b) to understand the interaction of the
denaturants with different residues in lysozyme. In 2 M GdmCl solution,
we find that the maximum occupancy of Gdm+ is near the
residues Asp52 and Glu35, which are important for the catalytic activity
of lysozyme (Figure 5a,c). This shows that Gdm+ interacts strongly with the
active residues and can inhibit the interaction of the substrate with
these residues, diminishing the catalytic activity of lysozyme. This
also explains the decrease in lysozyme activity even at low GdmCl
concentrations (Figure 2). The interaction of Gdm+ with the catalytic residues
is further verified by computing the radial distribution function, g(r), between the central C atom of urea
or Gdm+ and acidic O atoms of Asp52 or Glu35. The computed g(r) shows that Gdm+ interacts
with these residues strongly compared with urea (Figure 5e). The strong interaction
between Gdm+ and the catalytic residues, Asp52 and Glu35
anions, is due to the electrostatic interaction. The average numbers
of hydrogen bonds between Gdm+ and residues Asp52 and Glu35
are 3.3 and 2.8, respectively, in 2 M GdmCl solution, whereas urea
is found to barely form hydrogen bonds with these residues. Asp and
Glu are hydrogen bond acceptors, and Gdm+ is preferred
over urea because of the following reasons: (1) Gdm+ is
more polar than urea; (2) urea has only four hydrogen atoms that can
be part of hydrogen bonding, whereas Gdm+ has six hydrogen
atoms; (3) the geometry of Gdm+ is apt to make maximum
number of hydrogen bonds with Asp52 and Glu35 (Figure 5c). The decrease in the activity of lysozyme
in a low-concentration GdmCl solution must be due to the less accessibility
of catalytic residues Asp52 and Glu35 rather than the structural change
in lysozyme due to unfolding. At a higher concentration, the loss
in activity is associated with the structural change. A similar observation
has been reported in the case of papain.62,63 At low denaturant concentrations, there was a loss in the activity
of papain without any structural change, and this was attributed to
the complex formation of the denaturant molecules with the active
residues of papain.62,63

Figure 5 Spatial density maps of (a) Gdm+ and (b) urea within
5 Å of the protein with fractional occupancy more than 0.75 in
2 M denaturant solution at T = 300 K. The protein is shown in gray,
and orange dots show Gdm+ or urea fractional occupancy.
(c) Interaction of Gdm+ with Asp52 and Glu35 side chains.
(d) Interaction of urea with Trp63 and Thr118 side chains. In (a)–(d),
red spheres represent oxygen, blue spheres represent nitrogen, and
white spheres represent hydrogen. (e) Radial distribution function, g(r), between the central C atom of urea
or Gdm+ and acidic O atoms of Asp52 and Glu35. (f) Radial
distribution function, g(r), between
the amine nitrogen of Trp62 and Trp63 residues with the central C
atom of urea and Gdm+.

From the spatial density distribution of urea, we find that
urea
strongly interacts with the residues Trp63 and Thr118 with an occupancy
∼0.8 (Figure 5b) and it does not interact strongly with the catalytic residues,
Asp52 and Glu35 (Figure 5e). In urea solution, most of the catalytic residues are freely accessible
due to their weak interaction with urea except Trp63, which is in
the vicinity of the substrate-binding pocket. Trp63 is present in
the loop region (Trp62 to Cys76) close to the active site, whereas
Thr118 is far from the active region. The radial distribution function
shows that Gdm+ does not interact very strongly with either
Trp63 or Trp62, whereas urea interacts strongly with Trp63 but not
with Trp62 (Figure 5f). The sharp peak in g(r) between
Trp63 and Thr118 with urea implies that urea interacts strongly with
these residues. The strong interaction with Trp63 could be due to
the NH−π interaction as reported recently,64 and direct hydrogen bonding between urea and
Thr118 is also observed in the X-ray diffraction studies.65 The partial changes in the activity of lysozyme
with the increase in urea concentration can be possible due to the
small conformational changes near the substrate-binding pocket due
to the interaction of urea with Trp63 (Figure S6). The conformational changes are inferred from the root-mean-square
deviation (RMSD) of Trp63 and the loop region compared with their
position in the crystal structure (Figure S6). Higher RMSD values for Trp63 and the protein loop region are observed
only in urea solutions and not in GdmCl solutions.

To understand
the effect of denaturant and disulfide bonds on structural
change, we have performed molecular dynamics simulations of lysozyme
starting with the folded structure as the initial conformation in
the presence (native) and absence (reduced) of disulfide bonds at
different denaturant concentrations. For each denaturant concentration,
the time scale of the simulation is 300 ns and the temperature is
maintained at T = 325 K. The simulations show that
in the presence of all of the four disulfide bonds the protein is
very stable on a time scale of 300 ns and the average radius of gyration
(Rg) of the protein is constant within
the error bars as the denaturant (urea or GdmCl) concentration is
varied from 0 to 8 M (Figure S7). In the
absence of all of the four disulfide bonds, the average Rg of the protein is found to increase with an increase
in the denaturant concentration (Figure S7). The simulation results indicate that the disulfide bonds enhance
the stability of the folded state of lysozyme. We also performed a
long simulation of ∼2.5 μs in 8 M GdmCl and urea solutions
(Figure S8). The protein did not unfold
on this time scale. To check for the force field effects, we also
performed a long simulation (∼500 ns) using the CHARMM36 force
field,42 and the protein did not unfold
on this time scale (Figure S9). Due to
this reason, we cannot conclusively comment on the unfolding mechanism
of lysozyme in the presence of urea and GdmCl from simulations.

To understand the role of disulfide bonds in lysozyme unfolding
in the presence of denaturants, we have performed an assay experiment
with 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), which has
been successively used for the identification of free −SH groups
in proteins (details of the method are given in the SI).66 The absorption spectra of
DTNB with protein in the presence and absence of 6 M GdmCl and urea
(Figure S10) are same and do not show any
feature at ∼412 nm, suggesting that the addition of GdmCl and
urea does not perturb the disulfide bonds present in lysozyme. This
indicates that the disulfide bonds are intact in the denatured ensemble
of lysozyme obtained by the addition of GdmCl.

The experimental
activity data as well as the CD data in the tertiary
region clearly indicates that the disulfide bonds present in lysozyme
are not broken in the presence of urea. Furthermore, we have also
performed the activity experiment of lysozyme in the reduced condition,
which shows a gradual decrease in the activity (Figure S11) similar to the case of GdmCl, clearly suggesting
that urea denatures the protein only when the disulfide bonds are
broken using reducing agents.

In summary, lysozyme loses its
activity at low GdmCl concentration
due to the strong interaction between Gdm+ and residues
present in the active site of lysozyme. At high GdmCl concentration,
structural changes induced by GdmCl also contribute to the loss in
lysozyme activity. In the urea solution, no loss in activity is observed
as there is no strong interaction between urea and active residues.
Fluorescence and CD spectra show that the protein unfolds in the presence
of GdmCl and not in urea solution, and GdmCl unfolds lysozyme, without
breaking the disulfide bonds present in the protein.
