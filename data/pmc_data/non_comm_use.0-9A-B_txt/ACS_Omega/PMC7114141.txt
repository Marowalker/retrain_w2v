The detailed investigation
of the chemical
structure of vitrinite-rich Karharbari coal was performed utilizing
advanced analytical techniques. The salient objective of this work
is the evaluation of various structural properties of coal, which
is necessary for identifying the chemical and physical interactions
between coal and various reactants during its utilization. Karharbari
coal is a poorly organized coal with high aromatic content. The value
of corrected aromaticity (fa’)
was found to be 0.82 by 13C NMR spectroscopy and was also
confirmed by XRD (aromaticity = 0.84) and FT-IR analysis (aromaticity
= 0.82). The average molecular weight of the aromatic cluster was
found to be 507 amu by the NMR result, which is closer to the result
obtained by HRTEM (MW = 530 amu). The structural and lattice parameters
of Karharbari coal were obtained by NMR spectroscopy and then compared
with the similar rank Argonne Premium coal. The molecular weight distribution
was obtained by LD-TOF-MS and compared with HRTEM fringe model analysis.
The presence of different heteroatoms like carbon, oxygen, nitrogen,
and sulfur with their functionalities was determined by using the
XPS technique. Different carbon/oxygen functionalities present in
the Karharbari coal were found to be (C–C) and (C–H)
68.5%, (C–O) 23.4%, (COO–) 1.9%, and (C=O)
6.0%. Nitrogen functionalities such as pyridine, pyrrolic, quaternary,
and oxidized nitrogen and their compositions (mol %) were 19.3, 45.6,
31.2, and 3.7%, respectively. Different forms of sulfur were also
found to be present, namely, thiophenes, sulfones, sulfuric acid,
and sulfates with the molar contents of 16.4, 41.6, 21.3, and 20.5%,
respectively. This information will be useful in improvising coal
utilization techniques.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Coal is a heterogeneous material and has a three-dimensional
macromolecular structure, which consists of maceral and minerals.1,2 Carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen are the main constituents of macerals
with some amount of sulfur and nitrogen. The maceral is a combination
of different inputs and depositional environments, which can be distinguished
as liptinite, vitrinite, and inertinite. Liptinite has the highest
hydrogen to carbon (H/C) atomic ratio, whereas vitrinite and inertinite
have a comparatively lower H/C atomic ratio.3 The amount, chemical structure, and distribution of various macerals
in coal are highly dependent on the condition of coalification and
chemical nature of the coal-forming materials.4,5 A
typical maceral structure of coal consists of alkyl-substituted aromatic
and polyaromatic bonded by covalent and non-covalent bonds (van der
Waals interaction, hydrogen bond, electrostatic interactions, and
π–π interaction, etc.).1,6−8 Incumbent coal
conversion processes and inefficient utilization of coal prompted
researchers to understand its structure at a fundamental level and
represent a molecular model.9−23

The first partial coal structure developed
by Wender13 shows 92 atoms (molecular formula,
C42H40O10), consisting of a single
aromatic ring cross-linked by aliphatic chains. Nishioka proposed
two models stating that coal has networking structures, namely, non-associative
and associative.16,17 The former signifies coal as
macromolecules, which are not soluble in organic solvents, whereas
the latter defines it as individual molecules linked to each other
by non-covalent bonds.14,15 Due to these variations, different
ranks of coal yields different percentages of the product.18,19 Out of all networking structures, associated structure yields higher
extraction by breaking the secondary interactions with alkylation,
acetylation, and silylation.20−22 Cody et al.23 suggested that entwined
chains may also be present in the coal network structure. Therefore,
coal might be assumed to be a combined structure of associated, non-associated,
and entwined chains.

Modern instrumental analytical techniques
such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), solid-state 13C nuclear
magnetic resonance (13C NMR) spectroscopy, Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, laser desorption ionization time-of-flight
mass spectroscopy (LD-TOF-MS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),
and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) are some
non-destructive techniques that are helpful in obtaining more structural
parameters of coal without destroying it by converting into small
molecules, whereas flash-pyrolysis gas chromatography–mass
spectroscopy (py-GC/MS) tends to produce small molecules.24

Solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy
has unique capabilities and is non-destructive in nature, making it
ideal for analyzing a carbon skeletal structure of a coal sample by
applying cross-polarization (CP) magic-angle spinning (MAS), cross-polarization
(CP) total sideband suppression (TOSS), single pulse excitation (SPE),
dipolar decoupling, and variable contact time techniques.25,26 FT-IR spectroscopy is widely used to study the structure, geochemical,
and other relevant characteristics of coal.27,28 Peaks
in FT-IR spectrograms of coal samples are composite and highly dispersed
due to the high complexity of the coal. Apart from these techniques,
X-ray diffraction (XRD) is also a useful tool to determine different
structural parameters of coal with good reproducibility.29−32

Flash-pyrolysis gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (py-GC/MS)
is another technique that can be utilized to investigate coal. The
limitation with py-GC/MS analysis of coal is that only a small percentage
of coal is pyrolyzed, and the size of the GC column is limited for
the fragments that can transverse the column.33 In laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy
(LD-TOF-MS), the molecular weight distribution of various groups present
in coal can be determined, but quantitative analysis of individual
compounds cannot be performed.34,35 Much of the coals (except
anthracite) consist of very small size aromatic layers, which are
poorly oriented. These aromatic layers can be obtained by using high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) in the form of lattice fringes.
The aromatic stacking and alignment of the lattice fringes could be
obtained by HRTEM images, which help to represent the molecular size
and spatial arrangement of coal macromolecules that can also be calculated
by the fringe length. Most layers in bituminous coal are single, and
very few layers are stacked on to each other.36,37

The study of coal structure and chemical behavior of its macromolecules
is very challenging to the investigators with various physical and
analytical techniques developed for the structural characterization
of coal. The main objective of these techniques is to provide a better
understanding of the structure of coal. Coal is the primary energy
source in India, and in view of this, the structural study of Karharbari
coal (a vitrinite-rich low-volatile bituminous coal) from the Talcher
Coalfield, Orissa, India, was performed with the help of previously
discussed techniques in order to avoid any ambiguities and complications
that are involved with efficient coal utilization. The improved understanding
of the chemical structure of coal at a molecular level has been effectively
used in the prediction of coal behavior (reactivity and reaction mechanism)
in its various utilization processes. These new investigations have
also led to the utilization of coal for converting it into different
products.

2 Experiments
2.1 Coal
Sample Preparation
The coal sample was crushed and ground
to 200 mesh size
and demineralized to reduce the amount of mineral matter present.
Demineralization is carried out to minimize the effect of mineral
materials during analytical analysis. A combination of HCL (CAS no.
7647-01-0) and HF (CAS no. 7664-39-3), as supplied by Sigma-Aldrich,
was used for the demineralization process because HF and HCl do not
disrupt the molecular structure of the coal as a lixiviant. A 5 M
dilute solution of HCl was prepared from a 32% concentrated solution
(provided), and HF (48% concentrated) was used without any purification.
An amount of 50 g of the 200 mesh coal sample was stirred with a magnetic
stirrer continuously into 200 mL of 5 M HCl solution (maintaining
a 4 mL (HCl):1 g (coal) ratio) in a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTEF)
beaker covered by Perspex lid for 24 h. The acid was separated by
centrifugation, and the precipitate was dissolved in lixiviant HF
(maintaining a 4 mL (HF):1 g (precipitate) ratio) and stirred for
24 h. The precipitate was separated from the acid solution by centrifugation
and then dissolved in 5 M HCl (maintaining a 4 mL (HCl):1 g (precipitate)
ratio) and stirred for 24 h. The resulting solution of the precipitate
and acid was then placed in a centrifuge for separation of acid, and
the precipitate was washed with hot deionized water until a pH of
7.0 was obtained for the filtrate. At last, the demineralized coal
sample was dried in a vacuum oven at 105 °C for 6 h and subsequently
stored in a desiccator.

Proximate analysis of the demineralized
coal sample was performed by standard methods (IS: 1350 (Part I-1984)).
Carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen were analyzed by means of a Perkin
Elmer elemental analyzer (model 2400). The sulfur determinator (Leco,
SC132) was used to determine the sulfur, and the percentage of oxygen
was calculated by difference. The maceral group compositions were
determined by the standard method (ASTM D 2799-05a, 2005). The true
density value of the demineralized coal sample was obtained by using
a JW-M100A helium pycnometer.

The free radicals were formed
during demineralization of the coal due to the removal of inorganic
cations constituted in the coal functional groups such as the carboxylic
acid functionalities. These free radicals can influence the intensity
of some of the 13C NMR analysis.38 This problem can be eradicated by treating the demineralized coal
sample with samarium(II) iodide (Sml2) in tetrahydrofuran
(0.1 M) to reduce the paramagnetic character without reducing the
diamagnetic character of organic coal compounds.39 The demineralized coal sample was mixed with 0.1 M Sml2 (maintaining an 8 mL (Sml2):1 g (coal) ratio)
in a beaker and stirred continuously with a magnetic stirrer for 12
h. After this treatment, the reaction was cooled with 30 mL of deionized
water, and THF was evaporated. The remaining residue was washed with
500 mL of diluted HCl (2 M) to remove the lanthanide ions. The residual
coal sample was washed with boiled deionized water until the pH of
7.0 for the filtrate was achieved. At last, the residual coal sample
was dried further in a vacuum oven at 105 °C for 6 h and subsequently
stored in a desiccator.

2.2 Coal Sample Characterization
2.2.1 Solid-State 13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(13C NMR) Spectroscopy
The solid-state 13C NMR analysis was carried out on a Bruker AVANCE III 500 MHz two-channel
spectrometer at the institutional instrumentation lab, IIT Roorkee.
The NMR apparatus operated at the resonant frequency of 13C nucleus of 100.13 MHz with a 5 mm probe and ZrO2 rotor
(outer diameter of 6 mm). The 13C NMR experiment was conducted
with cross-polarization (CP) magic-angle spinning (MAS) with a combination
of variable contact time and dipolar dephasing. Cross-polarization
(CP) experiments were carried out at ambient temperature. The CP-MAS
experiments were carried out at a MAS speed of 8 kHz with a sampling
time of 0.05 s, a pulse width of 4 μs, and a cycle delay time
of 5 s. A total of 7000 scans per spectrum were collected.

The
peak position of every functional group and its relative percentage
were assigned as discussed by Trewhella et al.40 Various lattice and structural parameters were calculated
by using the method of Solum et al.25 Twelve 13C parameters, which are aromaticity (fa), carbonyl carbon (faC), corrected aromaticity (fa’),
aliphatic carbon (fal), aliphatic carbon-containing
sp and sp2 carbon (falH), protonated carbon (faH), nonprotonated carbon (faN), aliphatic carbon (whose carbon is bond to oxygen) (fal0), nonprotonated aliphatic carbon-containing
sp3 carbon (fal*), phenolics or phenolic ester (faP), alkylated aromatic carbons (faS), and bridgehead carbons (faB) of coal macerals obtained by the method given by Solum
et al.25 All the 12 parameters are used
to estimate the aromatic cluster size and bridging extent of each
cluster of any coal.

Lattice parameters such as the average
number of aromatic carbon atoms per cluster (C) and
mole fraction of bridgehead carbon (Xb) were calculated from the structural parameters as follows: 1   2  where Co and m are constant parameters with a value
of Co = 19.57 and m =
4.15, respectively, obtained by Solum et al.25 The average number of attachment (σ + 1) and the fractional
amount of all bridges intact (Po) are
described by the following equations: 3   4  

The determination of
the last four lattice parameters including the number of bridges and
loops per cluster B.L., the number of side chains per cluster S.C.,
the average molecular weight of a cluster MW, and the average molecular
weight of a side chain or half of a bridge mass Mδ are defined as follows: 5   6   7   8  

The carbon % is taken from the elemental analysis
of the coal (dmmf), and MG is the
initial magnetization, which is taken as 2.4.25

Equation 2 determines
the aromatic cluster size in compounds for which Xb is known even when the structure is unknown. For a low-rank
coal average, the aromatic cluster size is one to three linear aromatic
rings containing less than nine carbons, whereas for higher-rank coal
the average aromatic cluster size is four to five nonlinear aromatic
rings containing more than 15 carbons.25 B.L. and S.C. obtained from eqs 5 and 6, respectively, indicate
the attachment or cross-linking through an aromatic culture obtained
by eq 2. B.L. indicates
the number of connections between clusters (bridges-B.L.) and connections
back to the same cluster (loops-B.L.). S.C. indicates the number of
attachments mainly the number of aliphatic side chains terminating
in methyl groups.

The 13C CP/MAS NMR analysis was
conducted with the combination of variable contact time and dipolar
dephasing techniques to improve the result accuracy. The demineralized
Karharbari coal was treated with samarium(II) iodide to eliminate
free radicals. Elimination of free radicals is required to improve
the quantitative reliability of the NMR spectrum.

2.2.2 Fourier Transform Infrared
(FT-IR) Spectroscopy
The FT-IR spectra of the demineralized
coal was obtained using a ShimadzuIRAffinity-1S FTIR spectrometer
at the chemical engineering department, MANIT Bhopal. The transmittance
and wavelength requirement was equal to 0.1 and 0.1 cm–1, respectively. The spectra were recorded at a resolution of 5 cm–1 within 4000–400 cm–1 over
32 scans.

Work done by Machnikowska et al.42 was used for the FT-IR spectral qualitative interpretation.
The band region (3000–2800 cm–1) belongs
to the aliphatic C–H stretching, and the band region (3100–3000
cm–1) can be attributed aromatic C–H stretching.
The bands at 2930 and 2850 cm–1 from the aliphatic
C–H stretching were assigned to asymmetric CH2 vibrations
and symmetric CH2 and CH3 vibrations, respectively.
The band at 1600 cm–1 corresponds to C=C
stretching vibration of the aromatic rings. The band on the left-hand
side of the C=C stretching vibration at 1680 cm–1 was assigned to C=O stretching. From C=O stretching
vibrations, it could be concluded that esters, aldehyde, ketone, or
−COOH may be present in the Karharbari coal. The bands at 1450
and 1170 cm–1 correspond to CH2 and CH3 vibrations, respectively. The strong intensity band at 1110–1000
cm–1 was associated with C–O stretching vibration
(ether groups) and O–H band groups. The 800–680 cm–1 band region was assigned to out-of-plane aromatic
C–H vibration. The band region (3250–3750 cm–1) was assigned to the various H-bond combinations, which suggest
the presence of different OH groups. The bands at 3700, 3650, 3619,
3511, and 3320 cm–1 were assigned to OH–ether
hydrogen bonds, OH–OH bonds, free OH groups, OH−π
hydrogen bond, and cyclic OH groups, respectively.

2.2.3 X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
X-ray diffraction was carried
out on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer
at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee. The diffractograms
of a demineralized coal sample were determined by using a Cu anode
Kα radiation (λ = 1.54059 Å) at 40 kV voltage and
40 mA current. The X-ray intensities were calculated in the range
of 2° ≤ 2θ ≤ 120° with a step size of
0.019°2θ. The phase quantification method was applied to
the resulting diffractograms for further analysis and smoothening.
After processing the diffractograms, the average structural parameters
were calculated from the peak widths at half-maximum intensity (β)
and the peak position (θ) by using the empirical expression
obtained from Scherrer (eqs 9–12).41,43

The average number of layers per carbon crystallite (Nave), the interlayer spacing between aromatic sheets (d002), average crystallite diameter (La,10), and average crystallite height (Lc) were calculated using the following equations: 9   10   11   12  where Kc is a constant that depends upon the X-ray reflection plane
of Cu Kα (0.89 for Cu Kα). Other structural parameters
include the fraction of amorphous carbon (xa), degree of disorder index (DOI), and aromaticity (fa), which can be calculated by using the following equations: 13   14   15  where SA and SC are the corresponding
areas of the separated peaks, and S002 and Sγ are the area under the
(002) band and the γ band, respectively. It was assumed
that (S002 and Sγ) S002 and Sγ were equal to the number of aromatic carbon and
aliphatic carbon atoms, respectively.

2.2.4 Flash-Pyrolysis
Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectroscopy (py-GC/MS)
Flash-pyrolysis
gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (py-GC/MS) analyses of
different compounds by partial destruction of macromolecules can be
investigated by thermal splitting (pyrolysis, py) of their peripheral
fragments, and the obtained pyrolysates can be investigated by an
analytical GC/MS apparatus.33 The demineralized
coal sample was pyrolyzed at 610 °C for 10 s using a temperature
programmed pyrolyzer (Double Shot Py-2020iD) coupled directly to the
injection port of a Thermo Finnigan gas chromatograph (GC) with a
single-ion mass spectrometer (MS). Py-2020iD contained a 1 cm quartz
tube, which could be heated to 1200 °C at a heating rate of 20
°C/ms by 2–3 mm diameter platinum filament. The average
weight charged into the pyrolyzer (PY) was 1 mg, and that occupied
about 1–1.5 mm of the quartz tube. Helium as the carrier gas
for the GC/MS was used to purge off the air from the sample before
pyrolysis and send the gas generated during the course of pyrolysis
to the GC for testing. The GC oven was set at a temperature of 40
°C
and then ramped to 290 °C at a rate of 4 °C/min. The identification
of various pyrolysis compounds was done by the MS analysis according
to data given by Nip et al.33

2.2.5 Laser Desorption Ionization
Time-of-Flight Mass Spectroscopy (LD-TOF-MS)
A Bruker Ultrafle
Xtreme MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy equipped with a UV laser (337 nm
wavelength) was used to obtain the mass spectra (in reflector mode
(70–5000 m/z)) of the coal
sample. A few micrograms of the powdered coal sample was drawn up
using a pipette tip and deposited into Milli-Q water that had already
been applied to the sample plates. The water was left to evaporate
from the plate in order to deposit the coal sample onto the target
sample plate. Reflector mode analysis were performed by using a pulse
voltage of 2300 V, source voltage of 15,000 V, and reflection voltage
of 2000 V, and a linear mode analysis was conducted by using a pulse
voltage of 1150 V and source voltage of 15,000 V. Each analysis was
performed at a laser-firing rate of 5 Hz by taking 10 shots at different
locations on the sample plate. The oversaturation of the detector
by high abundance can be avoided by conducting the analysis above
70 m/z.

2.2.6 X-ray
Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)
A physical Electronics PHI-5000
ESCA spectrometer was used with
monochromatic light Al Kα radiation and operated at 250 W. The
XPS experiment was performed at room temperature in a vacuum, and
an XPS pattern was recorded at the pass energy of 93.9 eV and a step
size of 0.5 eV. The binding energies were calibrated based on the
graphite C 1s hydrocarbon, and the peak at 284.6 eV was recorded.

2.2.7 High-Resolution
Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM)
The demineralized
coal sample (200 mesh) was analyzed by using a Tecnai G20 apparatus
at 200 kV, and the sample was photographed using a Gatan CCD camera
(Model 895). A few micrograms of the powdered coal sample was ground
in ethanol by hand and sprayed over a copper microgrid for HRTEM observation.
The lattice images were captured from the wedge-shaped particle, which
then subjected to image processing to extract the lattice fringes.
The extraction of lattice fringes was done according to the method
given by Sharma et al.36 Image processing
and analysis were accomplished utilizing Adobe Photoshop CC 2016 and
the image processing tool in MATLAB R2014a. Fringe lengths from HRTEM
binary images were obtained by using the image processing tool, which
is a graphical user interface developed in MATLAB. The aromatic layers
were seen as dark lines, while the aliphatic components were not readily
observed in the HRTEM image.37

The
aromatic portion of the structure is given by fringe lengths, which
were estimated by the carbon ring catenation and angle of viewing.
The series of aromatic skeletons were constructed assuming fringe
depth equal to the fringe width.37 Cut-off
length values for some small aromatic molecules are as follows: <3
Å for benzene, <4.4 Å for naphthalene, and <5.4 Å
for anthracene/phenanthrene. Other fringe lengths ranging from 5.5
to 34.5 Å were taken according to the work by Okolo et al.:41 5.5–8.4 Å for 2 × 2, 8.5–13.4
Å for 3 × 3, 13.5–17.4 Å for 4 × 4, 17.5–21.4
Å for 5 × 5, 21.5–25.4 Å for 6 × 6, 25.5–29.5
Å for 7 × 7, and 29.5–34.5 Å for 8 × 8.
The aromatic raft structures ranging from 2 × 2 to 8 × 8
were assumed to be taken as parallelogram-shaped sheets. All fringes
below 3 Å were ignored because they could not be clearly distinguished
from the background noise. Mathews et al.43 developed a set of equations (eqs 16–18) for calculating the
minimum (Cmin) and maximum (Cmax) carbon atoms in the parallelogram-shape aromatic
fringes and the molecular weight of an individual fringe: 16   17   18  

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Information
from Quality Analysis
The quality analysis of Karharbari
coal is summarized in Table 1. The Karharbari coal is vitrinite-rich (57.8%) with inertinite
(29.5%), and liptinite (12.7%). The values of the mean vitrinite reflectance
(0.59%) and volatile matter (33.6%) indicate the coal as a low-volatile
bituminous higher-rank coal. The proximate analysis of the Karharbari
coal provides the overall percentage (weight percentage on air-dry
basis) of volatile matter (33.6%), moisture (7.1%), ash (11.2%), and
fixed carbon (48.1%), and the ultimate analysis was found to consist
of weight percentage on dry mineral matter free basis of carbon, hydrogen,
nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen. The value of the helium pycnometer measurement
was 1.30 kg/m3 for the demineralized coal sample.

3.2 Solid-State 13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
Spectroscopy Analysis
The CP/MAS NMR spectrum of SmI2-treated demineralized
Karharbari coal is shown in Figure 1. Two distinct peaks could be found, which are the
aliphatic region (10–90 ppm) and the aromatic region (105–220
ppm). Both the regions of the spectrum can be further subdivided into
the smaller carbon-specific region. Structural parameters and lattice
parameters as discussed in the literature were found for SmI2-treated demineralized Karharbari coal, and the data is shown in Table 2.

Figure 1 13C CP/MAS
NMR spectrum of the Karharbari coal.

Table 2 Structural and Lattice Parameters of the Karharbari
Coal

0.337	17	4.5	0.82	3.7	0.82	507	13.82	
The corrected
aromaticity (fa’) of the Karharbari
coal was 0.82. The amount of nonprotonated carbon (faN) is more (0.56) than protonated carbon (faH, 0.26), phenolics or phenolic
ether (faP, 0.08), and alkylated
aromatic carbons (faS, 0.19).
It shows that more number of carbons were present in the aromatic
ring than side chains, and few carbons were also present in different
functional groups. Furthermore, it was observed that the bridgehead
carbons (faB) present was 0.29,
which is more than that of functional groups. This result indicates
that the coal macromolecules mainly consist of aromatic ring structures,
which are connected to aliphatic carbons and a few side chains. The
results of the determination of the lattice parameters indicate that
every cluster consists of 17 aromatic carbon atoms with 0.337 mole
fraction of bridgehead carbon, 3.7 bridges and loops, and 0.82 side
chains. Furthermore, the attachments to every cluster are 4.5. The
molecular weight of every average aromatic cluster is 507. The NMR
results are similar with the same-rank Argonne Premium coal (low-volatile
bituminous Pocahontas coal).2

3.3 Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR)
Spectroscopy Analysis
Figure 2 shows the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrogram
of the Karharbari coal investigated. The ratio of aliphatic hydrogen
(Hal) to aromatic hydrogen (Har) is an important
parameter for the construction of the macromolecular structure of
coal. Hal/Har is calculated by the ratio of
the area of the stretching vibration of aliphatic C–H (2800–3000
cm–1) to the area of stretching vibration of out-of-plane
aromatic C–H (680–800 cm–1). From Figure 2, the value of Hal/Har was obtained as 0.79. The peak areas of some
other parameters like aliphatic/aromatic and α(CH2)/α(CH3) were also calculated and are shown in Table 3.

3.4 X-ray Diffraction (XRD) Analysis
The XRD spectrum of
the demineralized Karharbari coal sample was
obtained and is shown in Figure 3. A small degree of a graphite-like structure was clearly
noticed due to the presence of two-dimensional reflection (002) and
(10) at −31.5° and −50°, respectively. The
intensity of the (002) band was very high because the aromatic ring
carbon layers are arranged in a spatial manner with some interlayer
distance (d002). The intensity of (10)
and (11) bands that correspond to the graphite position were very
low or invisible. A γ-band was observed and shown in the
XRD spectrum at the left-hand side of the (002) band. The γ-band
represents the aliphatic side chains that are attached to crystalline
carbon (aromatic carbon).

Karharbari coal.

The average structural parameters
were calculated and are represented in Table 4. The value of d002 for the Karharbari coal was found to be 4.63 Å, which is more
than vitrinite-rich Waterberg coal (d002= 3.97 Å),43 whereas
the Lc value was 13.96 Å, which is
also lower than the value for vitrinite-rich Waterberg coal (4.27
Å).43 The average number of layers
per carbon crystallite (Nave) was 2.54,
which is comparable with the same-rank vitrinite-rich low-volatile
bituminous coal.43 The value of the average
crystallite diameter (La,10) was 16.32
Å, which might have some error due to a weak (10) band in the
XRD diffractograms. Other structural parameters were fractions of
amorphous carbon-containing (xa) 0.56
and aromaticity (fa) 0.72, which were
lower than the value (0.84) obtained by 13C NMR CP/MAS,
and the degree of disorder index (DOI) was found to be 0.68. These
values also establish the fact that Karharbari coal has a poorly organized
structure.

3.5 Flash-Pyrolysis
Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectroscopy (py-GC/MS) Analysis
The demineralized Karharbari coal sample analyzed by py-GC/MS resulted
in the pyrolysis profile as shown in Figure 4. The presence of alkylindenes, alkylnaphthalenes,
alkylnaphthols, phenanthrene, alkylbenzenes, alkylphenols, polyaromatic,
and homologous series of n-alkanes and n-alk-1-enes can be clearly identified by the pyrolyte distribution
of the Karharbari coal sample. The higher aromatic content of the
Karharbari coal obtained by the FT-IR and NMR spectra was confirmed
by the pyrograms. The distribution of the major compositions obtained
by py-GC/MS is shown in Figure 5. The flash-pyrolysis GC/MS analysis of the coal sample has
a limitation that a small percentage of the coal can be pyrolyzed,
and the GC column has a size limit in regard to the fragments that
can be inserted.

3.6 Laser Desorption Ionization
Time-of-Flight Mass Spectroscopy (LD-TOF-MS)
Analysis
Laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass
spectra was obtained in the range of 75 to 4000 m/z in reflector mode for the demineralized Karharbari
coal sample and are presented in Figure 6. The laser power was varied to get maximum
molecular masses present in the coal sample. The higher laser power
results in higher-molecular-weight components to be observed, whereas
lower laser power extents result in lower-molecular-weight components.
An effective molecular mass distribution of coal can be obtained by
using LD-TOF-MS but is less effective toward the quantitative estimation
or the amounts of individual masses present. The spectra of the demineralized
Karharbari coal shown in Figure 6 shows the molecular weight distribution ranging from
4000 m/z with a maximum abundance
in the range of 1000–1500 m/z.

mass spectra of the Karharbari coal.

3.7 X-ray Photoelectron
Spectroscopy Analysis
The qualitative analysis, based on
surface elements or heteroatoms present in the coal, was obtained
by using X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectroscopy. A spectrum in the
range of binding energies of 0–1350 eV was collected, and the
results are shown in Figure 7. The peak heights in Figure 7 reveal the composition of surface elements, in which
C and O are present in majority, whereas the peaks associated with
N and S are in minority due to their low content. The XPS spectrogram
at C 1s, O 1s, N 1s, and S 2p are split and fitted by XPS PEAK software,
and the curves are plotted using Origin software, presented here in Figure 8a–d. The quantitative
analysis of the XPS spectrogram was carried out by Gaussian peak shapes
using Origin software.

Figure 8 (a) XPS O (1s),
(b) XPS
C (1s), (c) XPS N (1s), and (d) XPS S (2p) spectra of the demineralized
Karharbari coal.

The presence of different heteroatoms
like carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur were obtained in the XPS
spectrum at the binding energies of 289.6, 532.8, 400, and 162.3 eV,
respectively. The surface elemental concentration (atomic %) was obtained
by quantitative analysis of the peaks present in the spectrum, which
were 82.6% C 1s, 12.3% O 1s, 1.2% N 1s, and 1.7% S 2p.

It was
observed that four peaks were obtained by evaluation of the C (1s)
signal shown in Figure 8b, with the quantitative distribution (mol %) of the different carbon
forms present in coal given in Table 5. The constituents are aromatic graphitized carbon
(C–C) and aliphatic carbon (C–H) 68.5%, phenolic and
ether carbon (C–O) 23.4%, carboxyl (COO–)
1.9%, and carboxide (C=O) 6.0%.

The constituent evaluation
of N (1s) also yielded four peaks, which are represented in Figure 8c, and they are at
binding energies of 399.3, 400.8, 401.5, and 402.9 eV corresponding
to the different nitrogen forms pyridine, pyrrolic, quaternary, and
oxidized nitrogen, respectively. The molar distribution of pyridine,
pyrrolic, quaternary, and oxidized nitrogen are 19.3, 45.6, 31.2,
and 3.7%, respectively, as presented in Table 5.

The constituent evaluation of the
O (1s) spectrum and correspondent distributions were also calculated
and is presented in Figure 8a and Table 5. The O (1s) peak fitting provided five peaks at binding energies
of 530.2, 531.8, 532.3, 533.4, and 535.1 eV, which can be assigned
to inorganic oxygen, C=O, C–O, COO–, and absorbance oxygen with the molar percentages of 2.3, 23.1,
39.6, 31.2, and 3.5%, respectively.

Different sulfur species
were also studied by the peak evaluation of S (2p) spectra in the
region of 160–175 eV binding energy. It can be concluded that
the peaks at binding energies of 166.1 and 167.2 eV can be assigned
to sulfoxides with 16.4% on molar basis, and the peaks at binding
energies of 164.9, 168.4, and 169.8 eV were assigned to sulfoxides, thiophenes, sulfones and, sulfuric acid and sulfates with the molar contents of 16.4,
41.6, 21.3, and 20.5%, respectively.

3.8 High-Resolution Transmission
Electron Microscopy (HRTEM)
The sequence of extraction of
aromatic fringes is presented in Figure 9. Five areas were selected from the HRTEM
image for the extraction of the lattice fringes to obtain the actual
distribution of aromatic fringes in the demineralized Karharbari coal.
The skeletonized images of all five areas are shown in Figure 10, and the distribution and
grouping of all the aromatic fringes was done according to their fringe
length and molecular weight as presented in Table 6.

8 × 8	29.5–34.5	27.9	35.7	3300–4000	7	0.9	
The skeletonized image of HRTEM aromatic
fringes from Figure 10 clearly indicates that the fringes or layers in Karharbari coal
are poorly oriented, and most of these are nonplanar. It was observed
that a maximum of four-layer stack and an average of three-layer stack
were observed by HRTEM, which is close to the value of the stacking
number (Nave = 2.54) obtained by XRD.
The maximum fringe count was observed in the range of fringe length
of 5.5–13.4 Å, which is comparable to the average crystallite
size obtained by XRD. A good agreement was found from the comparison
of structural parameters obtained by XRD and HRTEM.

A total
of 680 fringes were extracted from all five HRTEM images, which can
be distributed in the coal sample according to their fringe length.
All the fringes were assumed to be parallelogram-shaped aromatic sheets
with two characteristic lengths, namely, maximum length (MaxL) and
minimum length (MinL). The series of parallelogram-shaped aromatic
sheets started from a single benzene-shaped fringe to an 8 ×
8 parallelogram fringe. All parallelogram-shaped aromatic fringes
are shown in Figure 11. Results show that the average molecular weight of the HRTEM analyzed
aromatic fringes was 530 amu comparable with the molecular weight
(507 amu) obtained by 13C NMR results.

Figure 11 Different fringes with
minimum length
(MinL) and maximum length (MaxL).

A fringe length
of <3.0 Å was neglected in the HRTEM image due to noise and
association with the same fringe length. A total of 50 fringes were
assumed as less than 3.0 Å fringe length to get an accurate distribution
of all fringe sizes in the coal sample. The fringe lengths of <4.4
and <5.4 Å were assigned to naphthalene and anthracene, respectively,
with an abundance of 17.6 and 14.1%, respectively. The contribution
of naphthalene and anthracene in the average molecular weight of the
HRTEM aromatic fringes was about 22.0 and 24.7 amu, respectively.
The Karharbari coal sample mainly consisted of a 2 × 2 aromatic
structure, which was assigned in the range of 5.5–8.4 Å
fringe length due to their maximum content of 22.1%, with a contribution
of 61.0 amu in average molecular weight of the HRTEM aromatic fringes.
From the HRTEM image analysis, their proportion of 3 × 3, 4 ×
4, 5 × 5, 6 × 6, 7 × 7, and 8 × 8 parallelogram
aromatic sheets in Karharbari coal was obtained as 19.4, 8.6, 5.2,
3.2, 1.6, and 0.9%, respectively, with the contribution of 97.2, 84.1,
80.6, 72.1, 48.3, and 35.04 amu in average molecular weight of HRTEM
aromatic fringes, respectively. Mathews et al.44 were the first to compare molecular weight distribution
results of HRTEM and LD-TOF-MS, and a similar approach was used here
to compare the molecular weight distribution in the interval of 200
amu with the frequency in the number of aromatic fringes for Karharbari
coal and is presented in Figure 12.

weight distribution of Karharbari coal determined by HRTEM model (purple)
and LD-TOF-MS (solid black).

4 Conclusions
The
Karharbari coal is a poorly organized amorphous
coal with a disordered index of 0.68, d002 of 4.63 Å, and Lc of 13.59 Å.
The aromaticity of the Karharbari coal was found to be 0.79 from the
XRD result, which was similar to the NMR result (corrected aromaticity
= 0.82). The elemental analysis obtained by CHNS analysis (80.1% C,
5.5% H, 1.9% N, 3.1% S, and 9.2% O) was confirmed by using XPS spectroscopy
(82.6% C 1s, 12.3% O 1s, 1.2% N 1s, and 1.7% S 2p). Different forms
of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur were also obtained by XPS
spectroscopy, and their functionalities were presented. The average
molecular weight of the aromatic cluster is 507 amu as obtained by
the NMR result, which is relatively closer to the result obtained
by HRTEM analysis (MW = 530 amu). The molecular weight distribution
of the Karharbari coal ranged to approximately 4000 amu by LD-TOF-MS
and HRTEM results. The maximum contributors (38.1%) of 5.5–8.4
Å fringe length were obtained in the Karharbari coal with a molecular
weight in the range of 250–750 amu, which was in agreement
with the maximum abundance at 700 m/z, as obtained by LD-TOF-MS analysis. This structural information
will aid in a better understanding of the conversion behavior of this
coal in current processes and the development of future processes.
