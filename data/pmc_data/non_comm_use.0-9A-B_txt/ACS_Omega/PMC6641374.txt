Polymer nanocomposites (PNCs) have become an exciting field of current research
and have attracted a huge interest among both academia and industry
during the last few decades. However, the multifunctional single-nanocomposite
film exhibiting the combination of desired structure and properties
still remains a big challenge. Herein, we report a novel strategy
to address these problems by using versatile polymer glycidyl methacrylate
(GMA) as a bridging medium between the filler and the polymer matrix,
resulting in high density of interfaces as well as strong interactions,
which lead to generation of tunable thermal, mechanical, and electrical
properties in the materials. The nanocomposites prepared by GMA bridging
exhibit the remarkable combination of thermal (Td = 342.2 °C, Tg = 150.1 °C
), mechanical (E = 7.6 Gpa and H = 0.45 Gpa ) and electrical (σ = 3.15 × 10−5 S/cm) properties. Hence, the conjugation approaches related to GMA
bridging facilitate a new paradigm for producing multifunctional polymer
nanocomposites having a unique combination of multifunctional properties,
which can be potentially used in next-generation polymer-based advanced
functional devices.

Introduction
Since the evolution
of nanographite platelets (NGPs) composed of
few graphene layers through exfoliation of graphite, it has been proven
to be a perfect two-dimensional (2D) crystal exhibiting unparalleled
properties in a number of fields. Nanographite platelets (NGPs), with
a platelet thickness less than 0.34–100 nm, are widely used
because of their high surface area, light weight, flexibility, high
thermal stability, excellent mechanical strength, remarkable electrical
conductivity, low cost, and ease of synthesis as compared to single-layer
graphene while retaining the desirable properties.1,2 The
NGPs provide a realistic and useful alternative to CNT, CNFs, and
possible graphene in a wide range of applications and natural abundance
of their precursor graphite.3,4 In spite of their irregular
shape, NGPs are preferred over other conventional fillers because
they give more freedom to the polymer nanocomposite (PNC) material
due to their better structural and functional properties and abroad
range of applications.

There are numerous studies in the progress
of polymer nanocomposites;
unfortunately, the need of a multifunctional single composite film
exhibiting altogether the impressive properties (structural, thermal,
mechanical, and electrical) remains a challenge. Haddon et al. reported
the synthesis of polymer nanocomposite by dispersing nanographite
platelets into the epoxy matrixes for excellent thermal conductivity
at low filler loading.5 Moreover, Veca
et al. reported the flexible nanocomposite films synthesized by epoxy
and few layer nanographite platelets for delivering a high conductivity.6 Chen et al. paid major attention to the study
of the strong interfacial interaction between multiwall carbon nanotube
and polyetherimide achieved through poly(9,9-dioctyfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)
coatings to provide remarkable mechanical and electrical conductivity
in the composite film.7 Among these recent
reports, Zhang et al. proposed a versatile approach to synthesize
a graphene/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) composite with remarkable
mechanical behavior by tuning the interfacial region.8 Recently, Wang et al. studied the aspects on the improvement
of the thermal transport across the interface between graphene and
epoxy nanocomposites by using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.9 Despite all these studies, (i) uniform distribution
and (ii) strong interfacial interaction between the filler and the
matrix, which defines the properties of the entire composite system,
remains an open question.10−13

It is generally accepted that the change in
interface plays a significant
role in affecting the structure/organization, dynamics, and properties
of the polymer nanocomposite that actually define and integrate new
character in the material. The alterations in chemistry and mobility
in interface region have a drastic impact on the bulk properties of
the composite. The effort to examine the interfacial properties and
then clarify the impact of interfacial bonding types (e.g., van der
Waals forces, H-bonds, covalent bonds, coordinate bonds) on the interfacial
behaviors are critical and indispensable for polymer nanocomposite
materials.14 To the best of our knowledge,
few theoretical studies performed to analyze the interfacial properties
of the composites through atomistic modeling were below expectation.15 Thus, the properties of the polymer nanocomposite
can be fully realized if its interfacial region is extended through
the progression of suitable linkages by using appropriate processing
route. Thus, the judicial selection of processing route diminishes
the interfacial tension and suppresses the agglomeration between the
filler and the matrix.16−21 In last few years, we have attempted novel processes such as melt
mixing, swift heavy ion irradiation,22 and
click chemistry23,24 for providing a high density
of the interfaces and strong covalent linkages between the filler
and the matrix.

In the present investigations, polymer nanocomposites
were designed
through a novel strategy by using glycidyl methacrylate bridge for
not only developing tailor-made properties but also controlling the
chemistry, which totally differs from those of bulk matrix. The glycidyl
methacrylate (GMA) not only alters the enthalpic and entropic interfacial
interaction and the proclivity of aggregation but also reduces the
interfacial tension, interfacial failure, and dispersed-phase coalescence
between the NGPs and PMMA matrix. The legitimate selection of GMA
as reactive compatibilizer containing both acrylic and epoxy groups
provides an opportunity in designing new material with simultaneous
improvement in thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties, which
make it light weight, low-cost, flexible, and durable material. Polymer
nanocomposites were prepared, compared, and fully characterized using
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
More than the conventional studies, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) is also utilized to elucidate the polymer/filler interaction.
Conductivity studies, as well as nanomechanical and thermal properties
of P-GMA-NGP composites, are also discussed in detail.

Result and Discussion
It is accepted by the researcher that the interaction between the
filler and polymer matrix at the interface plays a crucial role in
enhancing the structural properties of the entire composite. By understanding
the characteristics of interface region, it is possible to predict
as well as design polymer nanocomposites with preferred properties
and performance as shown in Figure 1. To enhance the overall performance of polymer nanocomposite,
properties of the interphase should be tailored by improving the intrinsic
properties of both the matrix and the nanofiller. Moreover, it is
considered that the dominant failure mode in filler-reinforced polymers
is the interphase related to debonding between matrix and filler,
its detection and even healing are particularly preferred.

Figure 1 Schematic representation
of GMA interphases between PMMA matrix
and NGP filler.

A robust and flexible
P-GMA-NGP film with a firm luster is attained
by GMA functionalization of NGP surfaces (GMA-f-NGPs). Moreover, these
films are soluble in a wide variety of organic solvents (CHCl3, benzene, toluene, acetone, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and dimethylformamide),
provided that the solvent effectively solvates the PMMA polymer (Figure S1a,b). Conversely, a solvent that does
not dissolve PMMA is also incapable of dissolving its composites,
as polymer plays the key role to define the solubility properties
of the composite material.25,26 All of the hybrid solutions
of P-GMA-NGP could stand high-power sonication and remain homogeneous
and stable with no discernible particulate or precipitate of black
agglomeration for almost one month, indicating the NGPs are bonded
to the solvated polymer.

Figure 2 represents
the FTIR spectrum of composite before and after the surface treatment
of NGPs. Pristine NGP shows that typical characteristic peaks at 3430,
1115, and 1069 cm–1 arises from hydroxyl groups,
C=C, and C–O epoxide groups, respectively. Upon GMA
functionalization, the reactive epoxy groups of GMA attached to a
polymer backbone offers numerous possibilities for modification of
NGP surface by nucleophilic ring opening of epoxide. The new peaks
at 1722 and 1611 cm–1 depicting −C=O
and −C=C stretching vibrations were observed, which
shows the successful covalent bonding between NGPs and GMA via the
ring-opening reaction.27 However, the distinct
peaks are not present in the precursor NGPs. After in situ polymerization,
the band intensity of P-GMA-NGPs composite shows a great enhancement,
which is attributed to GMA-f-NGPs overlapped with the characteristic
peaks of PMMA indicating the improved adhesive bonding via interfacial
cross-linking of the GMA chains with the PMMA matrix. Moreover, band
ranging from 1150 to 1250 cm–1 is due to the presence
of distinct characteristic absorption of pure PMMA polymer.28 The morphological studies of the composites
were analyzed by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM). Figure 2a2 shows the flat wrinkled surface with a carpet-like
morphology and no evident stack layers depicting the presence of nanoplatelets.
After GMA functionalization, one can clearly observe the GMA embedded
on the sheets of nanographite in Figure 2b2. A well-dispersed small darker spots of
GMA with no significant agglomeration exhibits the success of GMA
functionalization on the surface of NGPs. Moreover, the functionalization
of NGPs by GMA led to a substantial increase in dispersion. Upon in
situ polymerization, the P-GMA-NGP composite depicts the homogeneous
dispersion of NGPs in PMMA matrix without any aggregation due to the
empowered compatibility between the filler and polymer matrix through
GMA bridging. Overall, it is evident from Figures 2c3 and S2 that
all of the three components have achieved a uniform distribution,
which is mainly due to the bridging of GMA particles between the NGP
and PMMA matrix. This interconnected morphology leads to a nanoscale
surface roughness, which is likely to produce an enhanced mechanical
interlocking and adhesion between the filler and the matrix.

XRD is an effective technique to estimate the interlayer
changes
of graphite-related samples and its dispersion in the polymer matrix.
As shown in Figure S3, the XRD patterns
of NGP exhibit a sharp (002) graphite characteristic peak at 2θ
= 26.7° with 0.34 nm interlayer spacing.29 However, after functionalization of NGPs with GMA chains (GMA-f-NGPs),
the sharp peak of NGP diminishes, suggesting the disorder and loss
of structural regularity of the nanographite layers. Matsumoto et
al.30 reported the similar decrease in
the intensity of (002) diffraction peak, which was attributed to the
exfoliation of graphite into isolated graphene sheets. Further, the
P-GMA-NGP composite depicts a significant decrease in the peak intensity,
indicating the delamination of the NGPs on the way to the formation
of few-layered graphene platelets.31,32 The subsequent
interlayer polymerization makes PMMA linkages graft covalently onto
the surface of NGPs, which results in exfoliation into or few-layered
platelets.

XPS is used to study the quantitative and qualitative
chemical
analysis of functional groups grafted on the surface of NGPs. Figure 3 shows the deconvoluted
XPS spectra for the C 1s and O 1s orbitals, and the binding energies
of the grafted functional groups. The XPS spectrum of NGP, GMA-f-NGP,
and P-GMA-NGP composite depicts the raw data and the deconvolution
results resolved by the Gaussian–Lorentzian data fit. The intense
C 1s peak of NGPs in Figure 3a with graphitic structures C=C/C–C (85.4%)
and C–O (14.5%) at binding energy 284.5 and 286.2 eV, respectively,
depicts the presence of carbon functional groups. Additionally, the
deconvoluted O 1s region of NGPs in Figure 3b exhibits two binding energies located at
533.1 and 531.2 eV, which are assigned to C=O and C–O,
respectively. However, after GMA functionalization, the disappearance
of C–O at 286.2 eV (14.5%) along with the appearance of C–O–C
at 286.6 eV (38.8%) epoxide rings confirms the successful modification
of NGP surfaces by GMA compatibilizer, which effectively binds itself
across the interface promoting a homogeneous distribution of the NGPs
within the PMMA matrix (Figure 3c).33,34 The GMA introduces large entropic
components, which favors the uniform dispersion of NGP fillers and
PMMA matrix. Additionally, the analysis of the C 1s orbital energies
also provides evidence of a C–Si bond at 283.9 eV, which is
due to the pretreatment of NGPs by silane coupling agent. Compared
to GMA-f-NGPs, the intensity of C=C/C–C at 284.4 eV
for P-GMA-NGP composite increases from 37.2 to 66% due to the presence
of PMMA chains in the composite system (Figure 3e). Additionally, the O 1s peak representing
C=O at 533.1 eV for P-GMA-NGP composite (38.9%) becomes much
stronger than that for GMA-f-NGP (32.5%), suggesting an effective
in situ polymerization reaction (Figure 3f).35−37 The survey scan XPS spectra of
NGPs, GMA-f- NGP, and P-Gg-NGPs considerably from binding energy 0−1000
eV which relates to the O 1s, N 1s and Si 2p atoms are depicted in Figure S4.

b) NGPs, (c, d) GMA-f-NGPs, and (e, f) P-GMA-NGPs.

The thermal properties of the P-GMA-NGP composite
film prepared
by GMA bridging method were compared with those of P-NGP/S composite
prepared by conventional solution-blending method. The thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) techniques
were used to determine the thermal stability of the composite as shown
in Figure 4. The TGA
thermograms of PMMA and polymer nanocomposites were obtained under
a nitrogen atmosphere. Figure 4a depicts the thermal decomposition temperature of PMMA, GMA-f-NGPs,
P-NGP/S, and P-GMA-NGP. Thermolysis of GMA-f-NGP and consequently
its main mass loss happen at around 209 °C, which was continued
rapidly and then degraded at 400 °C. The enhancement in the thermal
decomposition temperature (Td) indicates
the presence of GMA functionalized chains on the surface of NGPs by
free-radical addition, which increases the thermal stability. After
polymerization, a substantial increase of approximately 80 °C
in the thermal decomposition temperature of P-GMA-NGP (Td = 342 °C) was observed than in that of P-NGP/S
synthesized by the solution-mixing method (245 °C). Compared
to P-NGP/S synthesized by the solution-mixing method, a remarkable
increase in the thermal stability of P-GMA-NGP composite was observed
due to the strong interfacial interaction between the polymer filler
through the bridging of GMA chains, which hinders the decomposition.38,39 Moreover, a higher residue of P-GMA-NGP at 600 °C can be attributed
to earlier functionalization of NGPs, which plays an important role
during the degradation of nanocomposite and leads to the formation
of a thermally stable product and contributes to the residue formation
in the end.

Figure 4 (a) TGA and (b) DSC thermograms of PMMA, GMA-f-NGPs, P-NGP/S, and
P-GMA-NGP.

The glass transition temperatures
of PMMA and its composites were
evaluated by using DSC as depicted in Figure 4b. For pure PMMA and GMA-f-NGPs, the values
of Tg = 89 and 98.2 °C were recorded,
respectively. There is an increase in the glass transition temperature
of the nanocomposites as compared to pure PMMA, which is tentatively
attributed to the confinement effect of the polymeric chains inside
the NGP galleries that restricts the movement of the polymeric chains.
Moreover, a prominent increase in the Tg of P-GMA-NGP (Tg = 150.1 °C) synthesized
through GMA bridging method as compared to P-NGP/S composite (Tg = 138.7 °C) prepared by the solution-blending
method was observed. The elevation in the Tg value of P-GMA-NGP is attributed to the uniform dispersion of NGPs
through GMA functionalization and strong covalent interaction between
GMA and NGPs at the surface.40,41

The molecular
weight of the polymer nanocomposites was studied
by using the gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The weight average
molecular weight (Mw) and the number average
molecular weight (Mn) decrease steadily
with the incorporation of GMA-f-NGPs within the PMMA matrix. Although
the Mw decreases significantly from 234 279 g mol–1 for PMMA to 101 000 g mol–1 for P-GMA-NGPs,
the Tg value still indicates an improvement
(Table 1). This observation
indicates the presence of a strong interfacial interaction between
GMA-f-NGPs and the PMMA matrix, which constrains the association of
the polymeric chains during heating. Therefore, this study shows that
the functionalized GMA chains on the NGP surface limits the mobility
of the composite, which provides a positive assistance to the glass
temperature to compensate for the loss of the Tg from the decrease in molecular weight prepared by GMA bridging.42

The mechanical properties of the polymer nanocomposite are closely
related to electrical and thermal properties to determine their performance
for various structural applications. To accurately characterize the
behavior of the material at local sites, the mechanical properties
are investigated by using a nanoindentation technique. Nanoindentation
is a powerful and advanced way for measuring the mechanical properties
of polymer nanocomposites.43 The aim of
the nanoindentation experiment is to determine various parameters
related to the mechanical behavior of the composite to study the structure,
bond strengths, flexibility, durability, and strength of the local
surface of the polymer nanocomposite films.44 Moreover, the nanoindentation technique also represents to study
the distribution of filler in the polymer matrix by mapping of the
surface at various micrometers by the indenter. The accuracy of the
measurements greatly affects the reliability of the subsequent data
analysis. The nanoindentation testing followed by analytical modeling
was studied for P-GMA-NGP composite system. These polymer nanocomposites
based on partially exfoliated and intercalated functionalized NGP
nanofillers are embedded within the PMMA matrix for evaluation in
the nanoscale range. The nanofillers are always considered to be spherical,
cylindrical, or disk shaped. In the present investigation, the intercalated
NGP fillers within the polymer galleries are considered as equivalent
oblate nanofillers for modeling. Finite element (FE) analysis was
conducted by using oblate NGP fillers with a radius >100 nm. The
Poisson
ratio and thickness of composite were assumed to be 0.3 and 0.5 μm,
respectively. It was also assumed that NGP fillers were uniformly
distributed such that the indentation stress field will not be affected
by the neighboring particles. As the volume fraction of the particle
was low (0.25 wt %), the filler distribution inside the PMMA polymer
matrix at the nanometer scale was treated as anisotropic distribution.
A typical conical tip Berkovich indenter with the semi-included angle
of 70.3° and a tip radius of 40 nm was used in the study.45 Due to the symmetric nature of the indenter
and the composite specimen, a 2D axis symmetric finite element model
was developed using ABAQUS for simulation.46,47Figure 5a1 shows
the finite element (FE) mesh of the P-GMA-NGP nanocomposite system.
Further, the zoomed image (Figure 5a2) depicts a very fine mesh in the contact zone beneath
the indenter tip to ensure the accuracy of the numerical results.
A total of 10 350 elements were used to model the nanoparticle
and the matrix. The output indentation force versus the indentation
depth curve was then used to predict the hardness and elastic modulus
of the particle by following the Oliver–Pharr method, which
was conducted by a nanoindentation instrument through a physical test.
For this purpose, the Oliver–Pharr method is first briefly
discussed.

Nowadays, Olive–Pharr model48 is extensively used for the analysis of load–displacement
curve by the incorporation of the procedure into the software. The
elastic–plastic materials show most successful and appropriate
calibration of the machine compliance, tip area function, and thermal
drift. The hardness (H) and the elastic modulus (E) values were attained from the simulated data of polymer
nanocomposite films obtained from the load–displacement curves
by the Oliver–Pharr method. The loading part of the curve was
the combination of elastic and plastic deformation, and the unloading
curve was dominated by elastic deformation. The mechanical properties
of the surfaces are significant for the comprehension behavior of
matrix and the incorporated filler material. A characteristic nanoindentation
adhesion test is comprised of pressing the tip into the patterned
sample, followed by unloading it at a constant rate, and finally obtaining
a distinctive pull-off force representing the adhering surfaces. All
the fitting parameters and their respective formulas obtained by loading–unloading
curves have been illustrated in our previous study.22 The as-prepared P-GMA-NGP polymer nanocomposite films were
further investigated by load–displacement curve. The nanoindentation
method was adopted to analyze the load–depth data by depth
sensing of the films using a sharp Berkovich indenter. In this procedure,
nanoindentation hardness (H), elastic modulus (E), brittleness index (or H/E ratio), wear resistance, and recovery index of free-standing polymer
nanocomposite films without any substrate was proposed. In Figure 5b, the variation
in the load–displacement curves of polymer nanocomposites were
denoted as P-GMA-NGP with increasing NGP loading from 0.25 to 1.25
wt % named as P-GMA-N0.25, P-GMA-N0.5, P-GMA-N0.75, P-GMA-N1, and
P-GMA-N1.25. The graph represents the decrease in the value of depth
of the residual impression (hres) with
increase in the NGP wt %. It is evident from the figure that for 1
mN load, the load–displacement curves appear to be smooth and
no pop-in and no detectable crack was observed during the whole loading–unloading
cycle.49 It is important to point out that
the nanoindentation experiment was performed on at least 10 samples
for each loading fraction and no significant changes were found, demonstrating
the uniform distribution of the filler in the matrix.

The hardness
(H) and elastic modulus (E) values
for polymer nanocomposite films prepared by GMA
Bridging were extensively studied by using the load–displacement
curve. Conventional nanoindentation hardness refers to the mean contact
pressure; this hardness, which is the contact hardness, is actually
dependent on the geometry of the indenter.50,51Figure 5c1 depicts
the hardness profile of P-GMA-NGP as a function of NGP wt %. It is
observed that the value of H for pure PMMA is 0.17
GPa, which is increased up to 0.26 GPa with only 0.25% of modified
NGPs and then to 0.45 GPa for 1.25 wt % of filler loadings. During
the indentation process, the indenter is in contact with modified
NGP particles embedded homogeneously in the PMMA matrix, which exhibits
a substantial increase in the hardness of the complete composite system.
Thus, the uniform distribution obtained by the GMA bridging method
is one of the most important factors that support the increase in
the hardness of the P-GMA-NGP composites at increasing loadings. Similarly,
the values of the elastic modulus increased following the same trend,
which mainly depends on the slope of harmonic interatomic potential.
It is evidently seen in Figure 5c2 that at a small weight fraction of 1.25% filler loadings,
the effective increase in the elastic modulus reaches to 7.6 GPa,
which is a significant increase of 4.4 GPa compared to that of pure
PMMA matrix. Till date, there is no report in literature depicting
such a remarkable increase inelastic modulus and hardness for polymer
nanocomposite films prepared by various methods (Table S1). Fundamentally, in the case of P-GMA-NGP composites,
the mechanical load applied to the polymer matrices was transferred
to the reinforced nanofillers via interphase, and such a behavior
depends on the structural and mechanical properties of the interfacial
bond between the polymer and filler as shown in Figure 5d1. A strong bond means an efficient load
transfer; thus, it has a positive effect on the mechanical properties
of nanocomposites. However, for P-NGP/S prepared by the typical solution-blending
method, the presence of a weak bond indicates a lack of load transfer,
which may cause crack initiation/propagation along the interphase
of the nanocomposites (Figure 5d2). All of these results reflect the superior mechanical
properties of P-GMA-NGP compared to P-NGP/S composites due to the
strong covalent bonding between the NGP and PMMA achieved through
GMA linkages at the interface.52,53 The error bars in the
graphs represent the standard deviation of the calculated values of
the hardness and elastic modulus.

To further investigate the
influence of processing techniques on
the preparation of polymer nanocomposites, fractured SEM images and
optical microscopy images are studied in detail. Figure S5a1,b1 depicts the fractured SEM images of P-GMA-NGP
and P-NGP/S nanocomposites. As depicted in the morphology, the P-GMA-NGPs
shows a strong interaction in comparison with P-NGP/S nanocomposites,
which is due to the versatile GMA, which binds NGP through functionalization
on one end and covalent bonded with the PMMA matrix on the other end.
Thus, the GMA bridging increases the volume of the interaction and
bonding between the polymer and filler. Moreover, the nanosize layers
are observed to be distributed evenly in the fractured surface of
P-GMA-NGPs, which was attributed to the high specific areas of NGPs
along with the uniform dispersion of the filler within the polymer
matrix. However, for P-NGP/S, the clusters of agglomerated PMMA and
microvoids are clearly visible on the fracture surface. Moreover,
the simplest test to determine whether the NGPs are dispersed homogeneously
in the polymer matrix is through an optical microscope. The P-GMA-NGP
shows the uniform distribution of the modified NGPs within the PMMA
matrix in Figure S5a2; however, for P-NGP/S, Figure S5b2 clearly depicts an uneven distribution
of black spots, which is due to the irregular distribution of the
NGPs into the host matrix. For further evaluation, the SEM micrograph
of polymer nanocomposites prepared by GMA bridging method was compared
with the solution-blending method. Figure S5a3 depicts a well- resolved feature in which NGPs are homogeneously
dispersed within the PMMA matrix; in contrast, P-NGP/S exhibits the
agglomeration, which may promote macroscopic defects that can lead
to the breakdown or failure of mechanical strength (Figure S5b3).

Besides hardness and elastic modulus,
wear resistance54 was also found to be
an important property for
protective hard coatings. The indirect estimation of wear resistance
using plastic resistance parameter (H/E) was attributed as an important parameter to explain the elastic–plastic
behavior of the polymer nanocomposite films. The domain of the validity
of H/E for nanocomposite films varies
in the range between 0 and 0.1. The variation in the H/E values at 1 mN load is shown in Figure S6a. The minimum value of H/E is 0.0531, obtained for pure PMMA, which is then increased
to 0.0541 with the addition of 0.25% of NGP and then shows a remarkable
increase of 0.0592 for P-GMA-N1.25. The increase in the value of H/E exhibits that a higher wear resistance
of the P-GMA-NGP composites corresponds to lesser plastic deformation.
Thus, P-GMA-NGP composites seem to be more appropriate for hard protective
and high wear resistance coating for aerospace automobile applications.
The E versus H graph depicts a linear
path indicating the toughness of the material.55Figure S6b shows the E/H values deviated from thumb rule, which
is expected for a polymer material. However, the parallel trend was
observed for P-GMA-NGP composites with respect to the standard rule
of thumb which depicts that these nanocomposites exhibit better mechanical
properties. Load versus displacement curves are further used to calculate
the elastic recovery (ER). Figure S6c depicts
the variation elastic recovery for polymer nanocomposite films at
various NGP loadings. In comparison with pure PMMA, the P-GMA-N1.25
shows 60.3% of elastic recovery exhibiting highest strength of the
composite which restricts the indenter. In addition, the hres/hmax curve of P-GMA-NGPs
depicts the opposite trend to that of ER (Figure S6d). The values of this parameter should vary between 0 and
1, where the lower limit corresponds to the rigid plastic behavior.
Our result varies between 0.404 and 0.553, which indicates that both
elastic and plastic behaviors are present in the P-GMA-NGP composites.
To study the elastic and plastic properties in terms of deformation
energy, the plastic deformation energy (Ur) have also been explored.
Generally, Ur of the polymer composites is estimated by an area surrounded
by the loading–unloading curve in the load–displacement
profile.48 In the present case, the values
of Ur are found in the range between 9.97 × 10−9 and 6.13 ×10−9 J as shown in Figure S6e. The value of H and
Ur are strongly depended upon ER. The results for Ur are also in good
agreement with the results for H.

It is concluded
from the comparison of results in Table 2 that the judicious choice of GMA as the bridging material at the
interface region in P-GMA-NGP composites results in the improvement
of the nanomechanical properties. Once GMA is introduced in the vicinity
of NGP filler, it exhibits the ability to transfer stress from the
matrix to the filler. The strongly bound surface layer of PMMA matrix
with compatible GMA and NGPs evidently diminishes the interfacial
tension between the modified filler and the matrix and suppresses
the agglomeration. The synergistic effect of the GMA compatibilizer
effectively binds itself across the interface and reduces the interfacial
tension between the components and minimizes the dispersed phase coalescence
promoting a fine distribution of the NGPs within the PMMA matrix and
also reduces the possibility of interfacial failure. The possible
mechanism for enhanced nanomechanical properties of P-GMA-NGP (GMA
bridging method) over P-NGP/S (solution mixing method) is due to the
initial modification of NGP surface by GMA which results in (i)
homogeneous dispersion, (ii) large volume of interfaces, (iii) reactive
sites, and (iv) strong covalent bonding with PMMA. The as-prepared
P-GMA-NGP composite material can withstand the compression, extension
breaking, and bending as per the requirement of the aerospace and
automobile industry.

The electrical property of the carbon-based polymer composites
was closely related to the dispersion state of carbon filler in the
matrix. The electrical conductivity of P-GMA-NGP composite was expected
to have a lower percolation threshold and a higher conductivity at
a lower NGP loading, which not only decreases the cost of the composite
but also preserves the processability of the composite system. The
ability to transform an insulating polymer into a conductor is strongly
desired. The variation in electrical conductivity of P-GMA-NGP composite
as a function of NGP wt % is shown in Figure 6a.

The percolation phenomenon explains
the method of forming a conducting
network using a conducting nanofiller within the insulating host polymer
matrices.37,38 According to the percolation theory, the
electrical conductivity of the polymer nanocomposite above the percolation
threshold (μc) value depends on the weight percentage
by scaling law.56 1  where σ
is the electrical conductivity
of the polymer nanocomposite, σo is the electrical
conductivity of the filler, μ is the weight percentage of NGPs,
μc is the percolation threshold, and t is the exponent.

At a percolation threshold (μc), the nanofillers
construct the interconnected networks of conducting paths throughout
the insulating polymer matrix and thus encourage a transition of insulator-to-conductor
corresponding to a steep increase in the electrical current of composites.
The percolation in the P-GMA-NGP composites was measured to occur
at the filler concentration (μc) of 0.75 wt %. Above
the percolation threshold, the electrical conductivity of composites
rapidly rises up to ∼3.2 × 10–1 at 1.25
wt %. The inset of the figure depicts the σ versus (μ
– μc) double logarithmic plot, which evaluates
1.80 conductivity exponent value (t). It should be noted that the
calculated t values lying in the range of 1.6–2
indicate the construction of three-dimensional networks.57 At that particular stage, the tunneling effect
occurs between the neighboring platelets of nanographite, which makes
the composite a useful multifunctional material (Figure 6b). All of the values of percolation
threshold and the electrical conductivity were averaged from four
to five different samples.

The temperature-dependent electrical
conductivity has been investigated
to explore the nature of charge transport and the mechanism of electrical
conduction. The standard two probe-method was employed to study the
conduction mechanism by using direct current conductivity versus temperature
ranging from 300 to 500 K. Figure 6c shows the log conductivity versus 1000/T curve for P-GMA-NGP composite depicting an increase in
the conductivity with increase in temperature. Electron transport
in composite materials normally involves thermally activated transport
through tunneling of charge carriers between the nearest-neighbor
particles at close proximity, enabling an overlap of electron wave
functions of each particle and at greater separations. The variable
range hopping (VRH) provides the conductivity through an optimal network
of electron-hopping sites.58

The
increase in the conductivity is because the conduction by the
charge-hopping mechanism of NGPs occurred between the polymeric chains.
The Mott’s variable range hopping model (VRH) is extensively
used to demonstrate the conduction mechanism that deals with electric
conductivity as a function of temperature for the disordered system.

The analytical equation for temperature conductivity dependence in the VRH model is described by 2  where σo is the pre-exponential
constant and To is the Mott’s characteristic
temperature, which is calculated by the relationship given in eq 3 3  The localized
states (To decreases with the increase
in NGP wt % which exhibits a
straight line between log σ versus 1/T−1/4, indicating the relation of conductivity with polaron transport
(Figure 6d). Two other
important parameters introduced by Mott, the average hopping distance
(R) between two localized states and the average
hopping energy (E), were determined by using the
following expressions 4   5  P-GMA-NGP composites exhibit a large surface
area due to the incorporation of NGP filler in the host PMMA matrix.
As the concentration of NGP increases from 0.25 to 1.25 wt % for P-GMA-NGP
composite system, both hopping distance and hopping energy decrease.
The incorporation of NGP filler within the composite system enhanced
the localized states of the charge carrier. Moreover, the increase
in temperature causes diffusion of the polymeric chains into the galleries
of the nanofillers, which promotes the exfoliation along with the
dispersion of NGPs within the composite system. The improved dispersion
results in increased N(EF) states along with a decrease in hopping distance; hence, a reduced
amount of energy is required for the carriers to create a transition
between the two different localized states.58−60 To compare
the electrical properties of P-GMA-NGPs, the composites were also
prepared by solution-blending method. The enhanced electrical property
of P-GMA-NGPs over P-NGP/S was probably due to the strong interfacial
interaction between the uniformly dispersed modified NGPs and PMMA
matrix, which favors the hopping mechanism. Moreover, the agglomeration
of NGPs in P-NGP/S composite is responsible for low conduction. The
values obtained from the equations of hopping conduction mechanism
for both GMA bridging and solution blending methods are summarized
in Table 3.

Conclusions
We
have successfully demonstrated a novel strategy for the facile
synthesis of P-GMA-NGPs nanocomposite, where GMA acts as a bridge
between NGPs and PMMA. Further, GMA bridging in P-GMA-NGP nanocomposite
exhibits a remarkable enhancement in the mechanical (elastic modulus,
hardness, stiffness, hard protective, elastic recovery, wear resistance),
thermal (thermal decomposition temperature, glass transition temperature),
and electrical properties (conductivity), which are confirmed through
nanoindentation, TGA/DSC, and two-probe techniques, respectively.
Thus, the exceptional feature of P-GMA-NGP multifunctional nanocomposite
provides mechanically strong, flexible, robust, and thermally stable
material, which could be potentially used in aerospace applications
and automobile industry.

Methods
Materials and Chemicals
The NGPs were prepared from
graphite flakes obtained by Asbury Carbon Inc. Purified MMA monomer
(Sigma-Aldrich) was extracted by sodium hydroxide solution. Glycidyl
methacrylate (GMA) and 3-aminepropyl trimethoxysilane (APTMS) were
supplied from Sigma-Aldrich. All of the other organic solvents used
in this study were of analytical grade and were used without further
purification.

P-GMA-NGP Composite Synthesis
The
NGPs were prepared
by modified Hummer’s method as reported earlier.20 The 0.5 g of the acid-treated NGPs (A-NGPs)
were introduced into 100 ml of ethanol containing 1% APTMS, and the
mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 12 h. The APTMS-treated NGPs
were again washed with ethanol and then dried under vacuum at room
temperature. Finally, the APTMS-NGP was reacted with GMA (compatibilizer)
for 8 h at 120 °C within the solution of CHCl3. The
functionalized NGPs (GMA-f-NGPs) were dried in vacuum oven for 12
h at 80 °C. Finally, the polymer composite (P-GMA-NGPs) comprising
poly(methyl methacrylate) and GMA-functionalized NGP were prepared
by in situ polymerization. The GMA-f-NGPs ranging from 0.25 to 1.25
wt % NGP loading were dispersed and sonicated in 10 g of MMA monomer
for 1 h and the reaction mixtures of the composites were added in
a three-neck round-bottom flask. The reaction flask was stirred at
80 °C for 5 h under N2 atmosphere. The polymerization
proceeds with the addition of AIBN to the mixture while stirring.
The resulting P-GMA-NGPs was filtered and washed repeatedly with methanol
and dried for 24 h in a vacuum. The schematic representation depicting
the stepwise synthesis of P-GMA-NGP composites is described in Figure S7.

Characterization
Structural
Properties
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectra were recorded with KBr pellets on Nicolet 5700 FTIR spectrophotometer
at a resolution of 4 cm–1. The scanned wave numbers
ranged from 400 to 4000 cm–1. The X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted on a micron technology
XPS (ESCA+) spectrophotometer. The surface morphology of the composite
films was analyzed by Zeiss MA EVO-18 Special edition SEM. The high-resolution
transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), JEOL 2100F instrument was
employed to study the morphology of the polymer nanocomposite films.
The sample for HRTEM analysis was prepared by depositing an aliquot
of the sample suspension onto a carbon grid and then the solvent was
allowed to evaporate. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies of the composites
were measured by using Rigaku Miniflex. The X-ray diffractometer with
Cu Kα radiation scanned from 5 to 45 °C with an increment
of 0.02° every 0.6 s. The average molecular weight of the composite
system was determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), Turbo
matrix-40 with THF as an eluent.

Thermal Properties
The DSC was conducted on a Shimadzu
DSC 60 instrument using nitrogen flow from room temperature at 400
to 10 °C min–1. The thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) was performed with (Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA851e) a thermogravimetric
analyzer under an inert atmosphere (owing N2 gas) ranging
from 25 to 700 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1.

Mechanical Properties
The mechanical properties of
the polymer nanocomposites at varying NGP loadings were measured by
using an IBIS nanoindentation system (model B, Fisher Cripps Laboratories
Pvt. Ltd., Australia) at room temperature. The maximum load of 500
mN along with force resolution of 500 nN, depth resolution
of 0.03 nm, and depth of 20 mm was applied. A Berkovich indenter was
used for testing the samples with a face angle of 65.27° and
tip radius of 100 nm. All of the samples were collected and analyzed
automatically by using the software provided by the manufacturer.

Electrical Properties
The conductivity of P-GMA-NGPs
was measured by using a standard two-probe technique using a Keithley
programmable current source (model 6517B) at room temperature with
rectangular (2 cm × 2 cm) films and silver paste ohmic contacts
at the edges of the films. The temperature-dependent conductivity
measurements were performed by placing the above setup in the oven
with a gradual increase in temperature (300–500 K) corresponding
to the electrical conductivity of the composites.
