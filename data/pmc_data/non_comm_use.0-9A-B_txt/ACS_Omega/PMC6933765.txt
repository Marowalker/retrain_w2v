The replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulation
is demonstrated
to readily predict the conformations of the macrocyclic drug lorlatinib,
as validated by solution NMR studies. In aqueous solution, lorlatinib
adopts a conformer identical to its target bound structure. This conformer
is stabilized by an extensive hydrogen bond network to the solvents.
In chloroform, lorlatinib populates two conformers with the second
one being less polar, which may contribute to lorlatinib’s
ability to cross cell membranes.

Introduction
Macrocycles are of particular interest
in medicinal chemistry.
They often display semirigid conformations, which not only allow them
to match one of their major conformations to their target proteins,
thereby achieving an increase in both binding affinity and selectivity
as compared to a nonmacrocyclic analogue, but also facilitate their
membrane penetration.1−3 Despite having molecular weights that often exceed
Lipinski’s rule of five,4 macrocyclization
may provide drug-like properties,1,2,5,6 such as significantly
improved metabolic stability and good oral bioavailability.7,8 In the past decades, more than 100 macrocyclic drugs and clinical
candidates have been marketed or studied in drug discovery programs,1 most of which are natural products, such as erythromycin,
cyclosporin A, rifampicin, spiramycin, and sirolimus.1,9 Synthetic macrocycles are attracting an increasing interest due
to their molecular diversity and complexity.10 Several recently approved drugs including vaniprevir,11 danoprevir,12 and
lorlatinib13 show the vast potential of
macrocycles in drug discovery.6,14 In particular, macrocycles
hold great promise for challenging targets such as protein–protein
interactions (PPIs).15,16 Recently macrocyclic drugs have
been reported to target a variety of PPIs, such as MDM2/p53,17 BCL-2,18 and IL-17A/IL-17RA.19

The target bound conformer of macrocycles
is expected to be present
in their solution ensembles to a measurable extent.20−25 Moreover, conformational dynamics involving bond rotations may result
in dynamic shielding or exposure of their functional groups in response
to changes in the polarity of the environment.26−28 Such “chameleonic”
behavior has been considered to be important for the penetration of
biological membranes and the bioavailability of macrocycles as drugs.26−29 Experimental methods, for example, NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography,
can be used to accurately determine the solution and solid state conformations
of macrocycles. However, they not only require real samples but also
are expensive and time-consuming.

Recent investigations30−38 have revealed a large and growing interest in the theoretical prediction
of the conformational landscape of macrocycles. Algorithms used include
geometric methods (distance geometry,30 inverse kinematics,34 etc.), Monte-Carlo
torsional sampling,33 and molecular dynamics
(MD)-based sampling methods (LowModeMD,32 accelerated MD,39 CoCo-MD,40 etc.). In addition, a comparison of the macrocycle
sampling performance of MacroModel,33 LowModeMD,32 and a distance-geometry-based algorithm in OMEGA41 was presented in our previous work.42 In general, conventional MD (cMD) simulations
are considered to be able to capture structural interconversions at
the atomic level.43 However, cMD simulations
of biological systems tend to get trapped in a large number of local
minima. To overcome the low sampling efficiency, the replica exchange
molecular dynamics simulation (REMD), which allows the exchange of
noninteracting replicas of the system at different temperatures, has
been applied to varepsilon-cyclodextrin and cyclic peptides.44,45 Despite recent advances, only a few studies have begun to investigate
how the properties of the environment (e.g., its polarity, hydrogen
bond donor and acceptor capability) affect the conformational preferences
of macrocycles and how these effects can be predicted.27,42 As body fluids are aqueous in nature while the bilipid layer of
cell membranes is nonpolar, advances that allow prediction of macrocycle
conformations in different environments would constitute a major step
toward prediction of their pharmaceutical properties.

Lorlatinib
(PF-06463922, Pfizer) is a selective and reversible
12-membered macrocyclic drug approved for treatment of nonsmall cell
lung cancer (NSCLC), possessing good effectiveness, safety, and bioavailablilty.46,47 As compared to linear analogues, the macrocyclic framework reduces
the number of rotatable bonds, leading to a more compact bioactive
conformer when bound to its target proteins, ALK (anaplastic lymphoma
kinase) and ROS1 (c-ros oncogene1 kinase).48 X-ray structures revealed that lorlatinib adopts the same bioactive
conformer in the two target protein crystals.13,46,49 However, high membrane and blood brain barrier
permeability13 indicates the possibility
that lorlatinib may display molecular chameleonicity. It is therefore
an excellent model to investigate conformational sampling of macrocycles
in solvents of different polarities.

In this study, we evaluated
the ability of REMD simulations to
predict the conformation ensembles of macrocycles in polar and nonpolar
environments using lorlatinib as an example. Aqueous solution was
used to mimic the body fluids and chloroform to mimic the hydrophobic
interior of the cell membrane. Chloroform was used as it has a dielectric
constant (ε = 4.8), close to that determined for a lipid bilayer
(ε = 3.0),50 and as it is the most
common nonpolar solvent used for NMR spectroscopy. Our simulations
revealed that the solvent has an essential impact on the conformational
distribution of lorlatinib, exerted via intermolecular interactions.
The simulation results were validated against solution NMR experiments,
indicating that REMD simulation is capable of predicting the ensemble
of lorlatinib in both environments.

Results
REMD Predictions
By periodical exchange attempts of
neighboring replicas at different temperatures, REMD simulations are
expected to efficiently explore larger conformational space than cMD,
which might remain in local minima. Using REMD, lorlatinib was simulated
in two solvents, viz., CHCl3 and a H2O/DMSO
(6:4) mixture, respectively, at temperatures ranging from 300 to 600
K. The H2O/DMSO mixture was used due to lorlatinib’s
poor aqueous solubility.

We calculated the one-dimensional free-energy
profile as a function of heavy-atom RMSD (Figure S1), which revealed an excellent convergence of the simulations
in both solvents, as presented by the free-energy profiles at three
periods of time: 80, 90, and 100 ns. Only one conformation, P1, was
found in aqueous solution, while two conformers were predicted to
exist in CHCl3 (P1 and P2). P1 is similar to the crystal
structure of lorlatinib complexed with ALK (PDB ID: 4CLI; Pc,
RMSD 0.27 Å), and P2 has an RMSD of 1.2 Å to Pc (Figure S2). This suggests that lorlatinib
binds to its target proteins (ALK and ROS1) in the conformation it
adopts in aqueous solution.

As the RMSD of the overall structure
might hide local motion of
the structural motifs, lorlatinib was divided into two parts, Part
1 and Part 2 (Figure 1A). RMSDs of these two parts were calculated for all the snapshots
taken from the simulation at 300 K. While the RMSD of Part 1 (RMSD_part1)
mainly describes the ring flip motion originating from rotation about
the bond between the pyridine and pyrazole rings, RMSD of Part 2 (RMSD_part2)
is sensitive to the benzene ring flip motion originating from rotation
about the single bonds in Part 2 and rotation about the amide bond
(Figure 1B). Two-dimensional
free-energy landscapes were thus calculated with the two RMSDs as
reaction coordinates. The population of P1 in CHCl3 was
calculated to be 80%, while that of P2 is 20% (Figure 1B,D). RMSDs of P1 to Pc are 0.25 Å both
for Part 1 and Part 2, further supporting that P1 and Pc are identical
conformations. P2 has RMSDs of ∼1.5 and ∼0.9 Å
to Pc for Part 1 and Part 2, respectively, correlating with the major
structural change as compared to Pc. Furthermore, P1 is
∼11.3 kJ/mol more stable than P2 in terms of the calculated
free energy. The free-energy barrier of P1 changing to P2 is ∼22.6
kJ/mol, indicating that P1 and P2 interconvert in chloroform. According
to the minimum free-energy pathway (Figure 1D), the conformational shift from P1 to P2
is initiated by an inward flip of both Part 1 and Part 2, followed
by Part 1 flipping further inward; indicating the importance of flip
motions of the pyridine ring. Only conformer P1 (100%) was predicted
to exist in H2O/DMSO (6:4) (Figure 1C).

and in CHCl3, respectively. The minimum free-energy pathway
is shown as a gray line.

NMR
Lorlatinib was analyzed in D2O/DMSO-d6 (6:4) and CDCl3. Experimental population-averaged
distances were determined by acquisition of nuclear Overhauser enhancement
(NOE) build-ups at 800 MHz and by conversion of the initial build-up
rates into interproton distances (Tables S1, S2, and S3). A theoretical ensemble covering the entire available
conformational space was generated by unrestrained Monte Carlo conformational
search using the GB/SA water and chloroform solvation models. Following
redundant conformation elimination, conformations from all individual
searches were combined and used as theoretical inputs for the NAMFIS
analyses (Table S4). The NAMFIS algorithm
has previously been successfully applied for the description of solution
ensemble of various flexible macrocycles.25,42,51,52 Solution ensembles
were determined by varying the probability of each conformation and
fitting the back-calculated distances for each computationally predicated
conformation to the experimentally determined population-averaged
distances derived from NMR studies for the two solvents (D2O/DMSO-d6 and CDCl3) (Tables S6 and S7).

These analyses (Table S7 and Figure S7) resulted in one conformer
(1) in D2O/DMSO-d6 (Figure 2A) and two
conformers in CDCl3 (1 and 2)
(Figure 2B). In CDCl3, 1 is also the major conformer
(76%), while 2 is the minor one with a population of
24% (Table S7). Conformation 1 showed higher overall similarity (RMSD 0.35 Å) than 2 (RMSD 1.02 Å) to the crystal structure Pc (Table S8). This experimental observation is in excellent agreement
with the REMD prediction (Figure 2). The overall difference between 1 and
P1 (RMSD 0.15 Å), and 2 and P2 difference (RMSD
0.17 Å) is very small.

Discussion
The ability of REMD simulations to accurately
predict the solution
ensembles of lorlatinib in both polar and nonpolar environments was
confirmed by NMR conformational studies. The different conformational
spaces populated in different solvents reveal that the solvent plays
an important role in determining lorlatinib’s conformations.

To understand the observed molecular chameleonicity on an atomic
level, a detailed analysis of the REMD simulation trajectory was performed.
In H2O/DMSO, lorlatinib was found to maintain an extensive
hydrogen bond network throughout the simulation in which both lorlatinib
and H2O could act as both hydrogen bond donor and acceptor
(Figure 3A). This hydrogen
bond network may reduce the flexibility of the compound, explaining
the observation of a single conformer in aqueous solution. In contrast,
there is no strong interaction between the solvent and lorlatinib
in CHCl3 (Figure 3B), allowing bond rotations.

and the solvents.
(A) There is a hydrogen bond network (red dashed lines) in H2O/DMSO, (B) while no strong intermolecular interaction in CHCl3. (C) Alignment of P1 and P2. The average distance between
the HB donor and acceptor during the REMD simulations is provided
along the dashed line (Å). The percentage time of HB during the
REMD simulations is shown in the brackets.

To further validate the importance of water and
the hydrogen bond
network in constraining the conformation of lorlatinib, we performed
another REMD simulation in pure water. The free-energy profile showed
one conformation only (P1, Figure S3),
which is the same as the P1 in CHCl3 and H2O/DMSO.
Again, a strong HB network was formed between water and lorlatinib
where both water and lorlatinib could act as the HB donor and acceptor,
similar to what we observed in H2O/DMSO (Figure 3A). This confirms that the
hydrogen bond donor and acceptor capabilities of the solvent may significantly
affect the conformational preferences of macrocycles.

We found
that the carbonyl group of the amide bond is fully exposed
in aqueous solution (1/P1) but partially shielded by
the pyridine moiety in conformation 2/P2 in chloroform
(Figure 3C and Figure S4), indicating that 2/P2
might be more hydrophobic. Indeed, the calculated solvent accessible
3D polar surface area26 of conformation 2/P2 is significantly smaller than that of 1/P1 (193.5:209.8 vs 212.5:216.5 Å2), while the 3D
lipophilicity (MLP) of 2/P2 is higher than that of 1/P1 (1.28:1.34 vs 1.19:1.14). In addition, 2/P2 has a lower dipole moment (μ = 3.5/3.6 D) compared to 1/P1 (μ = 4.1/4.4 D) (Figure S4). The more hydrophobic profile of 2/P2 indicates that
it should prefer low polarity environments. Therefore, lorlatinib
adopts 1/P1 in body fluids, while conformation 2/P2 may help penetrating cell membranes. The low free-energy
barrier from P1 to P2 allows the drug to switch its conformation while
crossing membranes, thus favoring its cell permeability.

To
evaluate the scope of using REMD for conformational sampling
of macrocycles, a simulation of the ensemble of the macrocycle radicicol
in CHCl3 was carried out. A previous NAMFIS analysis has
found that radicicol populates the target (Hsp90) bound conformation
to 21% in CDCl3.21 The REMD
simulation found six conformations in CHCl3, with populations
ranging from 5 to 33% (Figure S5). The
second-ranked conformer (28%) is almost identical to the crystal structure
of radicicol complexed with Hsp90 (RMSD 0.18 Å, PDB ID: 1BGQ). Thus, the REMD
prediction is in excellent agreement with the reported NAMFIS analysis.21

Conclusions
With lorlatinib as an example, we demonstrate
that REMD simulations
are capable of predicting the conformational ensembles of macrocycles
in different solvents. The predicted structures and populations are
in excellent agreement with the experimental NMR data. Lorlatinib
adopts the same conformer in H2O/DMSO (6:4) as when bound
to its protein target, while an additional conformer exists in CHCl3. The hydrogen bond network formed by lorlatinib and water
is proposed to play an important role in constraining the macrocycle’s
conformation in water. Population of a different and less polar conformation
in chloroform, accessed by crossing a low energy barrier, most likely
explains how lorlatinib penetrates cell membranes. Additional validation
of the REMD simulation approach was obtained for the macrocycle radicicol.
This simulation identified a major conformation very similar to radicicol’s
target bound conformation, which was previously found by NAMFIS analysis
of solution NMR data. Therefore, the REMD simulation shows a potential
for prediction of the conformational landscape of macrocycles and
for understanding of the membrane permeability of macrocyclic drugs.

Experimental Section
System Preparation and REMD Simulation
The initial
structure of lorlatinib was obtained by ChemDraw, followed by an optimization
using Gaussian 09 at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. The RESP partial atomic
charge was obtained based on optimized structures by the antechamber
program. The system was immersed in a cubic solvent box, including
CHCl3 or H2O/DMSO (6:4) using the tleap module
in the Amber16 package. The total number of atoms in each simulation
system was kept at ∼1850. The general Amber force field (GAFF)
was applied to obtain the force field parameters of the compound.

The structure of lorlatinib was first minimized with 5000 steps of
the steepest descent method, followed by 5000 steps of the conjugated
gradient method. To equilibrate the systems, a short MD simulation
of 2 ns was performed prior to the REMD simulation. Finally, 100 ns
REMD simulations were performed in two different solvents, viz., CHCl3 and H2O/DMSO. Conformations at all temperatures
were sampled at every 2 ps. Here, all REMD simulations were performed
with 22 replicas at temperatures ranging from 300 to 600 K, which
was predicted by the webserver (http://folding.bmc.uu.se/remd/). The conformational change of lorlatinib was monitored through
the RMSD of lorlatinib using the cpptraj module in the Amber16 package.

NMR Spectroscopy
NMR spectra recorded at 25 °C
on an 800 MHz Bruker Avance III HD NMR spectrometer equipped with
a TCI cryogenic probe, for D2O/DMSO-d6 (6:4) and CDCl3 solutions. Assignments were deduced
using 1D (1H and 13C) and 2D (COSY, TOCSY, HSQC,
HMBC, and NOESY) NMR spectra. NOESY buildups were acquired with seven
mixing times of 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, and 700 ms, with 16
scans, 8096 points in the direct whereas 512 points in the indirect
dimension and d1 relaxation delay set
to 2.5 s, without solvent suppression. Interproton distances (Tables S2 and S3) were calculated according to
the initial rate approximation from the linear part of the buildups
(r2 > 0.95) using orthoaromatic protons
(2.51 Å) and methine to methyl proton distances (2.43 Å)
as internal distance references. NOE peak intensities were calculated
using normalization of both cross peaks and diagonal peaks according
to ([cross peak1 × cross peak2]/[diagonal peak1 × diagonal
peak2])0.5. Initial NOE buildup rates were converted into
distances using the equation rij = rref(σref/σij)(1/6) where rij is the distance between protons i and j in angstrom, and σij is the normalized intensity obtained from NOESY experiments.

NAMFIS Analyses
The theoretically available conformational
space conformation ensembles of lorlatinib were identified by unrestrained
Monte Carlo conformational analysis using five different (OPLS, OPLS-2005,
OPLS3e, AMBER*, and MMFF) force fields, each with the GB/SA solvation
models chloroform and water.1 Conformational
searches were done using the Monte Carlo algorithm with intermediate
torsion sampling, 50,000 Monte Carlo steps, and an RMSD cut-off set
to 2.0 Å. Molecular mechanics energy minimization was performed
for each conformation using the Polak-Ribière-type conjugate
gradient (PRCG), as implemented in the Macromodel BatchMin V12.1 of
the Schrödinger Package, with a maximum of 5000 iterative steps.
All conformations within 42 kJ/mol from the global minimum were saved
(Table S4) and combined with elimination
of redundant conformations by comparison of heavy atom coordinates
applying an RMSD cutoff set to 1.0 Å, giving the final ensemble
used for NAMFIS analysis.

Solution ensembles were determined
by fitting the experimentally measured distances to those back-calculated
for computationally predicted conformations following previously described
protocols.25,53 CH2 signals were treated
according to the equation d = (((d1–6) + (d2–6))/2)−1/6, and methyl signals
according to d = (((d1–6) + (d2–6) + (d3–6))/3)−1/6. The NAMFIS ensemble analyses were validated using
standard methods, that is, through evaluation of the reliability of
the conformational restraints by the addition of 10% random noise
to the experimental data, by the random removal of individual restraints,
and by comparison of the experimentally observed and back-calculated
distances. The result of the NAMFIS analysis is given in Table S7 and Figure S7 for D2O/DMSO-d6 (6:4) and CDCl3. Further information
about the NAMFIS analysis is provided in the Supporting Information.

Solvent accessible 3D polar surface area
was calculated as previously
described using a solvent probe radius of 1.4 Å and with inclusion
of partial charges in addition to polar atoms (O, N, and attached
H).26 The molecular lipophilicity potential
(MLP)-based virtual log P, a quantitative 3D description
of lipophilicity, was calculated as implemented in the VEGA ZZ suite.54,55
