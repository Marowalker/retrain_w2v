Membrane-active antibiotics are of
great interest in fighting bacterial
resistance. α-Mangostin is a membrane-active molecule, but there
are no details of its mechanism of action at the atomistic level.
We have employed free-energy simulations and microsecond-long conventional
molecular dynamics simulations to study the mode of interaction of
α-mangostin with a model bacterial membrane and compare it with
the mechanisms of three hydrophobic molecules (ciprofloxacin, xanthone,
and tetracycline). We find that α-mangostin is thermodynamically
more favored to insert into the membrane compared to the other three
molecules. Apart from tetracycline, which is largely hydrophilic,
the other three molecules aggregate in water; however, only α-mangostin
can penetrate into the lipid tail region of the membrane. When it
reaches a high concentration in the lipid tail region, α-mangostin
can form tubular clusters that span the two head group regions of
the membrane, resulting in a large number of water translocations
along the transmembrane aggregates. Structure–activity relationship
analysis revealed two structural properties that characterize α-mangostin,
namely, the two isoprenyl groups and the polar groups present in the
aromatic rings, which result in “disruptive amphiphilicity”
and hence its excellent membrane activity.

1 Introduction
Antibiotic
resistance is a serious healthcare issue globally due
to the overuse of antibiotics.1 New antibiotics
with novel modes of action are urgently needed. Membrane-active antimicrobials,
such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), and membrane-active natural
products are promising new-generation antibiotics that appear to circumvent
the issue of bacterial resistance.2−4 In contrast to conventional
antibiotics that target intracellular macromolecules and interfere
with bacterial biosynthesis, these new-generation antibiotics target
the bacterial membranes and hence have the advantages of rapid killing,
low tendency to induce resistance, and a broad antimicrobial spectrum.

Most AMPs are cationic and amphiphilic. The positively charged
residues are responsible for steering the peptide toward the anionic
bacterial membrane via electrostatic interactions. When adsorbed onto
the bacterial membrane, some peptides further penetrate into the lipid
tail region of the membrane and form membrane pores, resulting in
the loss of membrane potential and release of intracellular components.
Depending on the geometry of the pores as well as on the interactions
of AMPs with the pores, pores have been described by the barrel-stave
or toroidal model. In the barrel-stave model, the membrane does not
display significant curvature and the hydration of the membrane remains
unchanged, whereas in the toroidal model, the head groups lie along
the pore, resulting in significant curvature. Other peptides prefer
to locate at the membrane–water interface, and upon reaching
a critical concentration, disrupt the bacterial membrane into fragments,
and this process is referred to as the carpet mechanism. Molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations have been used extensively to examine the
modes of interactions of various AMPs with bacterial membranes.5−9 For example, Leontiadou et al. were the first to successfully simulate
the process of toroidal pore formation by the peptide magainin and
found that unexpectedly the toroidal pore during their simulations
displayed high disorder;5 such a dynamical
landscape of the toroidal pore was also observed for the peptide melittin.7,8 For AMPs acting via the carpet mechanism, MD simulations have revealed
key interactions between peptides and the membrane;6,9 however,
the exact process of membrane disruption is still elusive, mainly
because membrane disruption processes occur over much longer time
scales than are currently accessible to simulations. Although MD simulations
have provided exquisite details at the atomistic level to some extent,
full details of the mechanisms of actions of these molecules are still
lacking, resulting in a paucity of guiding design principles.10

Bacteria are classified into Gram-positive
and Gram-negative, depending
on their membrane architectures. Gram-positive bacteria consist of
an inner membrane and a thick layer of peptidoglycan outside the inner
membrane, whereas in Gram-negative bacteria, the inner membrane is
surrounded by an outer membrane, which consists of closely packed
lipopolysaccharides; this outer membrane forms an additional barrier
to exogenous agents, including membrane-active antimicrobials. It
has been proposed that the inner membrane is critical in maintaining
the stability of the bacterial membrane structure and that the disruption/perturbation
of the inner membrane is the rate-limiting step in the action of most
membrane-active antimicrobials.10,11 The primary issue in
the development of membrane-active antimicrobials is poor selectivity
because the difference between the bacterial membrane and human membrane
is not strikingly high. Another limitation of AMP antibiotics is low
proteolytic stability, which results in a short half-life in the body;
however, this can be overcome by using unnatural amino acids.10 Despite these issues, membrane-active antimicrobials
are promising potential therapeutics because they do not easily induce
resistance.10 Much effort has been put
into the development of such molecules targeting the inner membrane,
and several membrane-active molecules have entered clinical trials.12−14 Structurally, most of the membrane-active molecules consist of hydrophobic
moieties that impart them with the ability to interact favorably with
the lipid tails of the bacterial membranes. We have recently developed
a series of membrane-active molecules derived from α-mangostin
(denoted as mangostin hereafter), which is a xanthone-based natural
product isolated from the tropical fruit mangosteen.15 Mangostin displays rapid bactericidal effects and high
antimicrobial activity.16,17 Dye-leakage experiments
and membrane permeabilization assays confirm its membrane-targeting
mode of action.15 The available data have
been used to develop a mangostin-based pharmacophore model for the
design of membrane-active antimicrobials.18 Modification of mangostin with cationic groups further enhances
its selectivity, suggesting that mangostin is a good template for
the design of membrane-active antimicrobials. We speculate that the
membrane activity of mangostin is attributed to its ability to penetrate
into and perturb the bacterial membrane. However, the detailed mechanism
of action at an atomic level remains unknown. These molecules have
shown efficacy against Gram positives; however, given that they act
on the inner membrane, an understanding of their atomistic mechanisms
may guide the design of similar molecules to target Gram negatives
as well, for which there is an urgent need.

The mangostin molecule
consists of three aromatic rings, forming
a planar aromatic moiety. It was believed that the membrane activity
of mangostin arises from two structural properties: hydrophobicity
and the planar core structure. However, there exist other molecules
with high hydrophobicity and planarity, such as ciprofloxacin and
tetracycline, that do not show any membrane activity and act by entering
cells and targeting intracellular proteins. So why is it that molecules
with such similar characteristics have such widely different mechanisms
of action?

To probe the structural mechanisms underpinning these
differences,
we examine the interactions of mangostin and the other model hydrophobic
molecules (these molecules will also be referred to as hydrophobes
in this manuscript) with model bacterial membranes at an atomic level,
using molecular simulations. We employ molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
with rigorous free-energy calculations to examine the thermodynamic
properties of the hydrophobe–membrane systems. We select four
hydrophobic molecules, mangostin, xanthone, ciprofloxacin, and tetracycline
(Figure 1), as model
hydrophobes. All molecules contain aromatic rings and are thought
to aggregate in water. Mangostin and xanthone differ only in the lack
of the two isoprenyl groups in the latter. It is well established
that mangostin is membrane-active,15 whereas
xanthone has no membrane activity. The other two molecules, ciprofloxacin
and tetracycline, are both Food and Drug Administration-approved antibiotics
that act on intracellular targets and apparently have no known membrane
activity. We begin our study by first characterizing the aggregation
behavior of these molecules in water by computing their association
free energies. Next, we characterize the affinity of the four hydrophobes
with the membrane by computing the free energies associated with transferring
these molecules from the aqueous to the lipid phase. To understand
the thermodynamic forces driving membrane penetration, we decomposed
the transfer free energies of mangostin and ciprofloxacin into enthalpy
and entropy contributions; we chose these two because the other two
molecules appear to experience very high free-energy barriers to their
translocation across the membrane. Finally, to understand why mangostin
is membrane-active, whereas ciprofloxacin is not, we performed conventional
MD simulations of the membrane with the hydrophobes at high compound/lipid
ratios.

2 Methods
Molecular
dynamics simulations were used to investigate the interactions
of the four model compounds with a model bacterial membrane. The membrane
was modeled using a mixture of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylglycerol (POPG) lipids in a ratio
of 3/1 (POPE/POPG), and the coordinates were taken from our previous
studies.6,18,19 The GROMOS
53a6 force field20 was used to model the
lipid molecules and the four hydrophobes. The Web server ATB21 was used to generate topologies for the hydrophobes;
this server ensures compatibility with the GROMOS family of force
fields. As ciprofloxacin contains both amine and carboxyl groups,
it is zwitterionic at physiological pH. It has been shown that in
the membrane, ciprofloxacin assumes the uncharged form.22 If not otherwise specified, ciprofloxacin is
modeled in its zwitterionic form in the simulations without membrane,
and in its uncharged form in the membrane simulations. Umbrella sampling
and weighted histogram analysis were employed to calculate the association
free energies in water and the transfer free energies from the aqueous
phase to the lipid phase.23−25 Conventional MD simulations were
used to study the aggregation behavior of the four hydrophobes in
water and the interactions of the hydrophobes with the membrane at
a high compound/lipid ratio.

In umbrella sampling of the association
of each hydrophobe in water,
two monomer hydrophobe molecules were solvated in simple point-charge
(SPC) water26 and the size of each sampling
window was set at 0.15 nm, resulting in 24 umbrella windows. Simulations
of 50 ns were carried out for each umbrella sampling window for computing
the free energies of association of each compound in water, with the
last 25 ns used for constructing the potential of mean force (PMF).
The reaction coordinate for the free energy of association of each
compound was the distance between the centers of masses of the two
monomeric units of each compound; a correction term of 2kT ln(r) was added to account for the entropic
contributions.27,28 For the free energy of transfer
of each compound from water into the membrane, a membrane patch with
72 lipid molecules was used for the umbrella sampling simulations
and the size of each sampling window was set at 0.15 nm, resulting
in 28 umbrella windows. Simulations in each window were run for at
least 200 ns. For the membrane systems, the time scales of membrane
undulation are large, thus necessitating a much larger simulation
(200 ns) for each umbrella window. It has been shown that the primary
error in the PMF calculation of small molecules entering the lipid
bilayers from aqueous solution arises from hidden free-energy barriers,
which often arise as a result of the formation of lipid defects induced
by charged compounds.29 In such cases,
complex reaction coordinates are required. However, all four compounds
used in this study are uncharged with relatively rigid conformations
and hence are unlikely to induce significant membrane defects and
will sample the phase space sufficiently, thus resulting in converged
PMFs (outlined in Supporting Information). The reaction coordinate was the distance between the center of
mass of the compound and the lipid bilayer along the bilayer normal
(taken as the z direction); no entropic correction
was added because the reaction coordinate is only along the bilayer
normal. The error bars of each PMF profile were estimated using the
bootstrap method.24

To examine the
stability of higher oligomeric states of each compound
in water, 16 molecules of each compound were randomly placed in a
box of dimensions 7.5 × 7.5 × 7.5 nm3 solvated
with SPC water molecules, corresponding to a concentration of 60 mM.
Each system was subject to 150 ns of MD simulations. To examine the
effects of high compound/lipid ratios on the lipid bilayer, 16 molecules
of each compound were initially placed on top of a patch of the membrane
made up of 128 lipid molecules. Each simulation was run for 1.0 μs.
For ciprofloxacin, an additional simulation of 1.0 μs with 16
ciprofloxacin molecules initially placed in the center of the bilayer
was carried out because unlike mangostin, ciprofloxacin did not penetrate
into the membrane in the above simulations.

Simulation details
are outlined in Tables S1 and S2. During the MD simulations, the covalent bonds involving
hydrogen atoms were constrained using the LINCS algorithm,30 enabling a time step of 2 fs to be used. A plain
cutoff scheme at 1.4 nm was used to calculate the Lennard-Jones potentials.
The short-range electrostatic interactions in real space were cut
at a distance of 1.4 nm, whereas the long-range electrostatic interactions
in reciprocal space were calculated using the particle-mesh Ewald
algorithm. The temperature was maintained at 310 K by coupling the
system to a Nosé–Hoover heat bath, and the pressure
was maintained at 1 atm using the semi-isotropic Parrinello–Rahman
method.31 To decompose the free energies
into the associated enthalpy–entropy components, another set
of umbrella sampling simulations were also carried out at 323 K for
mangostin and ciprofloxacin. The entropy and enthalpy were then calculated
following the method of Pettitt32 using
the following equations    

3 Results and Discussions
3.1 Aggregation
in Water
All four compounds
investigated in this study consist of large aromatic rings and hence
are expected to aggregate in water. This is examined by computing
their association free energies in water using umbrella sampling MD
simulations (Figure 2). Mangostin, xanthone, and ciprofloxacin show strong tendencies
to aggregate as revealed by the large free-energy changes upon association.
In contrast, tetracycline shows much less tendency to aggregate, with
the computed minimum in the PMF at 0.56 nm and a depth of −9.7
kJ/mol. This value is at least 2-fold lower than for the other three
compounds. Although tetracycline has four hydrophobic rings in contrast
to the other compounds having only three rings each, the presence
of polar groups in tetracycline renders it more hydrophilic and hence
much less aggregation-prone than the others. The other three molecules
(mangostin, ciprofloxacin, and xanthone) all show strong tendencies
to aggregate. In particular, the large hydrophobic isoprenyl group
clearly makes mangostin most hydrophobic and hence most aggregation-prone.
The association free energies for ciprofloxacin and xanthone are similar,
but the xanthone molecules are more planar, enabling them to approach
closer to each other, as evidenced by the shorter intermolecular distance
of association (0.38 nm). In summary, our computations suggest that
the aggregation tendencies of the four molecules studied here follow,
in decreasing order: mangostin, ciprofloxacin, xanthone, and tetracycline.

Figure 2 Free energy

and tetracycline in water.

The above calculations were carried out using only two solute
molecules.
To understand the stability of higher oligomers in water, we carried
out conventional MD simulations using 16 molecules of each compound.
Typical snapshots obtained after 150 ns are shown in Figure 3. It is observed that mangostin,
ciprofloxacin, and xanthone aggregate much more than tetracycline
in water (Figure 3a–d).
This is in agreement with the free-energy calculations above and we
see that tetracycline has low hydrophobicity and exists largely in
a monomeric form, interspersed with relatively few oligomers. The
almost globular (proteinlike) aggregate of mangostin (Figure 3a) derives from the combined
effects of hydrophobicity resulting from stacking of the aromatic
rings, the asymmetry induced by the large isoprenyl groups, and the
large number of hydrogen bonds between oxygen and the hydroxyl groups
on the aromatic rings (Figures 3e and S1). Xanthone is more planar
due to the lack of isoprenyl groups and displays strong stacking behavior,
resulting in fewer hydrogen bonds between the oxygen and hydroxyl
groups on the aromatic rings. Ciprofloxacin, being planar and containing
charged groups, forms head-to-tail stacking, and a large number of
hydrogen bonds are formed between the amine and the carboxyl groups.
This suggests that aromatic stacking and hydrogen bonding are the
two forces driving the aggregation of mangostin and ciprofloxacin,
whereas hydrophobic stacking largely drives the aggregation of xanthone.

ns of the simulation; for clarity, water molecules are not shown.

3.2 Transfer
Free Energies into Membranes
To characterize the membrane
affinity of the four hydrophobes, transfer
free energies from water to the membrane were calculated using umbrella
sampling MD simulations (Figure 4). The free energies of transferring tetracycline into
the lipid environment are highly unfavorable. When approaching the
membrane from the aqueous phase, the free-energy profile of tetracycline
shows a primary minimum of −20 kJ/mol at 2.6 nm. This locates
it at the surface of the membrane, where hydrogen bonds with the head
groups appear to stabilize the complex. Further penetration leads
to rapid increase in the free energy, suggesting unfavorable interactions
with the lipid tails. Thus, both the association and transfer free-energy
profiles of tetracycline suggest that it is relatively hydrophilic.
The other three compounds show favorable free energies of transferring
from aqueous phase to the lipid phase, although the free-energy profiles
clearly show differences. Mangostin demonstrates the most favorable
transfer free energy, followed by ciprofloxacin and xanthone; ciprofloxacin
shows more favorable transfer free energies in our work than those
reported by Cramariuc and co-workers,22 which may arise from the different force fields and lipid types
used in their calculations. In our previous studies,15 we observed spontaneous penetration of mangostin into the
lipid tail region of the membrane, which is consistent with the free-energy
profile shown in Figure 4. Visualizations show that both ciprofloxacin and mangostin can penetrate
into and locate in the lipid tail region of the membrane. However,
mangostin is clearly much more favored than ciprofloxacin by ∼15
kJ/mol at the free-energy minimum, clearly reflecting more favorable
solvation in the membrane on account of it being more hydrophobic.
This can also be seen from the favorable free energy of mangostin
at the bilayer center compared to that in bulk water, whereas both
ciprofloxacin and xanthone display higher free energies at the bilayer
center than in bulk water. The important role of hydrophobicity in
the membrane affinity of mangostin can further be seen when its isoprenyl
groups are removed as is the case for xanthone; the free-energy difference
at the free-energy minimum is ∼20 kJ/mol. Comparison of the
position of the free-energy minima reveals that xanthone prefers to
remain at the membrane–water interface, whereas ciprofloxacin
can penetrate a little and stays just below the charged head groups
of the lipid bilayer, thus enabling interactions with the head groups
and with solvent water molecules.

Figure 4 Transfer free energy of each compound
from water to a model bacterial
membrane. Values next to the bidirectional arrows are the barriers
between the free energy at the minima and at the bilayer centers.

Another significant feature that
is evident in Figure 4 concerns the free-energy barriers
of different hydrophobic compounds as they cross the membrane center.
The barrier is defined as the free-energy difference between the free-energy
minimum and the free energy at the bilayer center, which relates to
the membrane permeability of a molecule. Again, mangostin shows the
lowest free-energy barrier (18.2 kJ/mol), followed by ciprofloxacin
(29.8 kJ/mol) and xanthone (52.5 kJ/mol). The high free-energy penalty
suggests that neither ciprofloxacin nor xanthone like to localize
at the center of the bilayer, in contrast to mangostin. The extent
of hydrophobic interactions afforded by the presence of the large
isoprenyl groups in mangostin is sufficient to compensate for the
loss of stabilizing interactions needed by the polar groups; the other
two molecules do not have such compensating hydrophobic groups. As
a result, ciprofloxacin or xanthone can accumulate only at low concentrations
in the lipid tail region of the membrane. In comparison, the much
lower free-energy barrier for mangostin enables it to translocate
easily across the bilayer center and can accumulate in high concentrations
in both leaflets of the membrane. The large numbers of mangostin molecules
in the interior of the membrane could potentially induce significant
membrane perturbations. Because the membrane activity of mangostin
is concentration-dependent, these results offer a plausible molecular
detail underlying the membrane activity of mangostin, in contrast
to ciprofloxacin and xanthone.

3.3 Enthalpy–Entropy
Decomposition of Mangostin
and Ciprofloxacin
Mangostin has been shown to have antimicrobial
activity with an MIC in the micromolar range.15 We have so far established that the antimicrobial activity of mangostin
likely arises from its ability to induce membrane perturbations as
a result of its high hydrophobicity combined with its planar structure.
Surprisingly, ciprofloxacin, with a planar structure and relatively
high hydrophobicity, is not membrane-active. Although we have seen
above that the isoprenyl groups of mangostin are the major drivers
of its increased solvability in the membrane, we would like to understand
the forces that drive the thermodynamic profiles seen above. We decompose
the above free-energy profiles of mangostin and ciprofloxacin into
the associated enthalpy and entropy contributions. This requires the
calculations of the free-energy profiles for both compounds at an
increased temperature, which we chose to be 323 K (Figure S2); the corresponding enthalpy and entropy contributions
were then obtained using the method of Pettitt et al.32 The method assumes that S is independent of temperature,
which strictly speaking, does not hold true for biological systems.
However, the two temperatures we chose are 310 and 323 K, which are
well above the phase-transition temperatures of POPE (298 K) and POPG
(269 K).33,34 Given the small temperature interval (13
K), the entropy weakly depends on temperature. Nevertheless, such
approximation provides a qualitative understanding of the enthalpy
and entropy contributions to the transfer free energy.

As the
molecules approach the membrane surface (2 nm from the lipid bilayer
center in Figure 5),
their adsorption on the membrane surface is enthalpy-driven. This
likely arises from two effects: (i) the direct interactions between
the polar groups of mangostin and of ciprofloxacin with the charged
head groups of the membrane and (ii) the large hydrophobic moieties
of the molecules in the aqueous phase exclude the surrounding water
molecules, thus “forcing” them into re-forming strong
interwater hydrogen bonds.35 It is known
that the hydrophobic effect can be either entropically or enthalpically
driven, depending on the length scale of the hydrophobe. When the
size of the hydrophobe is small, the hydrophobic association is entropically
driven, whereas it is enthalpically driven for large hydrophobes.36 It is reported that the crossover occurs when
the size is around that of neopentane.37 It is further reported that molecules with planar curvatures display
more significant dewetting than molecules with positive curvatures.38 Considering the size and the planar curvatures
of both mangostin and ciprofloxacin, the adsorption of both molecules
onto the membrane surface is an enthalpically driven process, in which
water molecules in the hydration shell re-form hydrogen bonds during
desolvation.

Figure 5 Enthalpic and entropic contributions to the total free
energy for
mangostin and ciprofloxacin translocating across the membrane.

Further penetration of the hydrophobes
into the lipid tail region
of the membrane depends on their interactions with the lipid tails
(enthalpic) and on maximizing their sampling of the conformational
space (entropic). Further penetration of ciprofloxacin into the lipid
tails is entropically unfavorable as it is difficult to create a cavity
in the lipid tail region due to unfavorable transfer free energies.
In contrast, the large isoprenyl groups that help solvate mangostin
in the lipid tail region of the membrane would result in its increased
mobility. As a result, it is easy to find a cavity large enough to
accommodate the mangostin molecule in the lipid tail region, thus
driving the process entropically. To examine the changes in motilities,
we define two angles, θ and ϕ, to characterize the orientation
of each molecule, where θ is the angle between the long axis
of the molecule and the bilayer normal and ϕ is the vector normal
to the aromatic plane and the bilayer normal. The probability distributions
of θ and ϕ at different distances from the bilayer center
were calculated (Figure S3). Although the
probability distribution of ϕ is similar for both molecules,
the distribution of θ is quite different with a much broader
distribution associated with mangostin. In particular, at certain
distances (e.g., distance = 1.05 nm), mangostin showed two peaks,
corresponding to two favorable orientations, whereas ciprofloxacin
assumes only one predominant orientation at all distances. This suggests
that in the lipid tail region the molecular entropy of mangostin is
higher than that of ciprofloxacin. Moreover, the position of the peaks
in the distribution profiles of θ for mangostin locates at larger
angles than that for ciprofloxacin, suggesting that mangostin tilts
more than ciprofloxacin. The higher tilt angle of mangostin is expected
to induce large perturbations of adjacent lipid chains, resulting
in greater disorder in the lipid chains surrounding the mangostin
molecule. In contrast, the smaller tilt angle suggests that ciprofloxacin
fits well and forms relatively tight packing with the lipid tails,
resulting in less perturbation and stronger nonbonding interactions
with the surrounding lipid chains.

3.4 Interactions
of Hydrophobes with Membranes
at a High Compound/Lipid Ratio
Although the transfer free-energy
profiles have provided us with a thermodynamic understanding of the
membrane affinity for mangostin and ciprofloxacin, these calculations
are focused only on one molecule of each compound, which corresponds
to a compound/lipid ratio of 1/72. It is known that membrane perturbation/disruption
is concentration-dependent and usually occurs at high compound/lipid
ratios, namely, above a critical concentration. To understand the
concentration dependence of the membrane activities of mangostin and
ciprofloxacin, we performed microsecond-long MD simulations using
16 molecules of each species with 128 lipids, corresponding to a compound/lipid
ratio of 1/8. These molecules were initially placed at the membrane
surface. The conformations at the end of each simulation after 1 μs
are shown in Figures 6 and 7. The ciprofloxacin molecules were found
to locate on the membrane surface and form aggregates by stacking
together (Figure 6a).
During the 1.0 μs MD simulations, only one molecule of ciprofloxacin
fully penetrates into the lipid tail region and stays just beneath
the head groups, whereas several molecules partially penetrate into
the membrane, consistent with the free-energy results. It may be argued
that the inability of ciprofloxacin to penetrate into the membrane
may be due to the unfavorable initial configuration (e.g., inappropriate
orientations and velocities of the 16 ciprofloxacin molecules) used
in the MD simulations. To rule out such possibilities, we performed
a second replica of the MD simulation for another 1.0 μs with
the 16 ciprofloxacin molecules initially placed at the bilayer center.
The simulation results (Figure 6b) show that as expected, all ciprofloxacin molecules move
to the membrane surface, staying on either the water–lipid
interface or just below the head group region of the membrane, consistent
with the free-energy calculations.

128 lipid molecules after 1 μs MD simulation with (a) the 16

of transmembrane aggregates. Water molecules that penetrated into
the lipid tail region are denoted as orange sticks. (b) Number of
intermolecular hydrogen bonds formed between the mangostin molecules
along the 1 μs MD simulation.

In the simulation of the 16 mangostin molecules initially
placed
on the membrane surface, all mangostin molecules penetrate into the
lipid tail region of the two leaflets of the membrane and remain stabilized.
At about 600 ns, some of the mangostin molecules were observed to
aggregate inside the membrane, forming a tubular cluster that spans
the two head group regions of the membrane (Figure 7a), similar to the structures of transmembrane
channels. Unlike the mangostin aggregate in water, which is driven
by both aromatic stacking and hydrogen bonding, the mangostin aggregate
in the lipid tail region is mainly driven by hydrogen bonding between
mangostin molecules and of course with the head groups/water molecules
at the membrane–water interface (Figure 7b). The formation of the hydrogen bonds significantly
reduces the unfavorable free energies of introducing the polar groups
in the lipid tail region and stabilizes the aggregate. The formation
of the transmembrane aggregate has two effects: (i) it induces lipid
defects around the mangostin aggregate and destabilizes the membrane–water
interface; (ii) the polar groups of the mangostin molecules in the
transmembrane aggregates attract water molecules, resulting in a large
number of water translocations across the membrane, forming transient
water channels along the tubular cluster, suggesting that the membrane
becomes leaky. In addition, due to the incorporation of a large number
of mangostin molecules in the lipid tail region, the membrane undergoes
expansion, with the area per lipid increasing by 10%; in contrast,
in the case of ciprofloxacin, the area per lipid increases by only
5% (Figure S4).

4 Discussions
Traditional antibiotics are thought to work by entering cells by
active or passive transport mechanisms and then somehow engage their
intended targets. However, the emergence of resistance to these molecules,
largely witnessed by single-point mutations in the targets, has driven
the focus of research on membrane-targeting molecules. These are fast-acting
bactericidals and are thought to perturb the bacterial membrane, thus
circumventing or averting the emergence of resistance.2 Atomic-level insights into the modes of actions of these
molecules on the membranes are essential for developing molecules
with higher therapeutic potentials. We have identified one such molecule
called mangostin.15 Comparing it with traditional
antibiotics tetracycline39 and ciprofloxacin,
we see that all three share similar features governed by hydrophobic
ring systems and decorated with different functional groups. However,
we know that only mangostin is membrane-active and this inspired us
to investigate their differential interactions with a model bacterial
membrane using MD simulations. Computations of the free energies of
association in water for each of these molecules suggest that although
tetracycline consists of a larger aromatic moiety indicative of easy
dimerization, the actual tendency to dimerize is quite low (10 kJ/mol),
indicating that the presence of polar groups in tetracycline (Figure 2) renders it a weak
hydrophobe. It is not surprising therefore that the computed transfer
free energy of tetracycline from the aqueous phase to the lipid phase
is not very favorable. The other three hydrophobic compounds, despite
consisting of only three hydrophobic rings each, all show much higher
hydrophobicity and membrane affinity, which likely arises from the
presence of fewer number of polar groups. To further understand the
partitioning of each compound into the membrane, we compared the octanol–water
partition coefficient log P of each compound.
Because of the lack of experimental data, the log P values of mangostin and xanthone are calculated from the ZINC database.40 The log P values for
mangostin, ciprofloxacin, xanthone, and tetracycline are 6.32, −0.55,
2.27, and 0.036, respectively.41,42 Except for ciprofloxacin,
the log P values of the other three compounds
are in qualitative agreement with the transfer free energies in Figure 4. We note that ciprofloxacin
is predominantly zwitterionic in aqueous solution; the negative log P for ciprofloxacin refers to the zwitterionic form, which
is not relevant here because only the uncharged form is used in the
membrane simulations in this study. As only the uncharged forms of
molecules are believed to penetrate across membranes,22 the actual log P for the uncharged
forms will be much higher.

However, an examination of Figures 2 and 4 reveals larger differences
in the association free energies of the compounds in water and their
transfer free energies into lipids. For example, the most favorable
association free energies of mangostin and xanthone in water differ
only by 5 kJ/mol, but their transfer free energies into the lipid
phase differ by ∼20 kJ/mol at the corresponding free-energy
minimum. This discrepancy arises because the two graphs represent
different properties of the molecules. In water, the interaction energy
between two monomers is dominated by hydrophobic stacking and hydrogen
bonding, whereas the transfer free energies report on the interaction
between the compound and the lipid molecules. Although these two free
energies are both related to the hydrophobicity of the particular
molecule, their association in water is reflective of their solubilities
and the transfer into the membrane is a measure of their membrane
affinities.

Comparison of the transfer free energies of mangostin
and xanthone
revealed that the two isoprenyl groups in the mangostin molecule contribute
significantly to its membrane affinity. Prenylation has been observed
to enhance the membrane affinity of many other molecules. For example,
prenylated isoflavanoids show enhanced membrane partitioning compared
to their nonprenylated analogues.43 Even
for macromolecules such as proteins, it was found that many membrane
proteins contain lipid chains such as farsenyl or geranyl groups to
facilitate their localization into/at membranes.44,45 This suggests that prenylation can be an efficient strategy to enhance
the affinity of a hydrophobic moiety for the membrane.

It is
known that among the four molecules studied here, only mangostin
is membrane-active. Thermodynamic analysis of the penetration of mangostin
into the membrane shows that once solvated into the lipid tail region,
mangostin is very mobile compared to ciprofloxacin, with entropy playing
a significant role. MD simulations further show that a large number
of mangostin molecules can penetrate into the membrane and form tubular
aggregates in the lipid tail region spanning the two head groups.
In contrast to its hydrophobic aggregation in water, this membrane-spanning
aggregate of mangostin molecules is stabilized by intermolecular hydrogen
bonds between the molecules; interactions between the terminal mangostin
molecules and the head groups of the membrane further stabilize this
assembly. The transmembrane aggregate of mangostin perturbs the bilayer
stability as follows: (i) it results in local heterogeneity in the
membrane, affecting the fluidity of the lipids; (ii) it perturbs the
surrounding lipid chains; and (iii) the presence of many polar groups
in the transmembrane aggregate leads to a transient water channel.
In contrast, xanthone, ciprofloxacin, or tetracycline, at low compound/lipid
ratios, cannot favorably penetrate the membrane. At high compound/lipid
ratios, only mangostin accumulates inside the membrane and forms the
membrane-disrupting oligomers. The other molecules clearly cross the
membrane; however, detailed mechanisms of cellular entry of these
molecules remain unclear.

Mangostin’s unique mechanism
of adsorption–penetration–aggregation
is different from that attributed to most AMPs. Mangostin has a small
molecule size with high hydrophobicity, which endows it with a favorable
transfer free energy from aqueous to the membrane phase. As a result,
mangostin accumulates to a high concentration in the lipid tail region
and forms membrane-spanning aggregates. The transmembrane aggregate
resembles the barrel-stave model in terms of the membrane curvature.
However, the mangostin aggregates do not induce membrane pores, although
it results in water translocation across the membrane. Moreover, unlike
most AMPs that are positively charged, mangostin is uncharged, and
is not favored to stay at the membrane surface and hence does not
function through the carpet mechanism. The lack of strong electrostatic
interactions with the head groups of the membrane results in a low
selectivity of 5.7,16 suggesting that adding
positively charged moieties to mangostin can potentially reduce the
activity (and hence toxicity) toward human membranes. Indeed, we have
shown that cationic analogues of mangostin significantly enhance the
selectivity for bacterial membranes.16−18

To develop principles
for the design of membrane-active molecules,
it is important to understand the structure–activity relationships
of molecules such as mangostin. From the structural point of view,
mangostin has several properties that characterize it as a membrane-active
molecule, including (i) a high membrane affinity resulting from the
presence of two isoprenyl groups (both ciprofloxacin and xanthone
lack the isoprenyl groups and show no penetration into the lipid tail
region of the membrane); (ii) a planar structure, which favors penetration
into the lipid tail region as it requires a smaller cavity compared
to that required by bulky globular groups; (iii) the presence of several
polar groups enabling it to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds and
subsequently transmembrane aggregates: this is an important property
because without those polar groups, a molecule will solubilize in
a lipid environment rather than form aggregates. This “disruptive
amphiphilicity” of the transmembrane aggregate is thought to
destabilize the membranes.46 On the other
hand, tetracycline contains more polar groups than mangostin, but
it cannot penetrate into the membrane because of the lack of lipid
probes, such as the isoprenyl groups. Together our findings suggest
that membrane activity may be enhanced in a molecule by engineering
in “disruptive amphiphilicity”. This would stem from
ensuring that the molecular scaffold combines strong hydrophobicity
to solvate into the lipid tail regions of the membranes with a sufficient
number of polar groups that can engage in hydrogen bonds with other
monomers upon penetration into the lipid tail regions and with the
lipid head groups.

5 Conclusions
In summary,
we have examined the aggregation propensity and membrane
affinity of four model hydrophobes: mangostin, ciprofloxacin, xanthone,
and tetracycline. Both the aggregation propensity and the membrane
affinity of these hydrophobes follow the order: mangostin, ciprofloxacin,
xanthone, and tetracycline, with tetracycline being the least hydrophobic.
MD simulations revealed that only mangostin is able to penetrate into
the membrane and accumulate at high concentrations in the lipid tail
region. Moreover, large numbers of mangostin molecules can form transmembrane
aggregates, which significantly destabilize the membrane. Structurally,
the membrane activity of mangostin is attributed to the presence of
the two isoprenyl groups and several polar groups on the aromatic
rings. These findings may guide the design of new membrane-active
antimicrobials.
