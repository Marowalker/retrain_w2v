In
this work, we demonstrate controlled drug delivery from low-temperature-sensitive
liposomes (LTSLs) mediated by photothermal heating from multibranched
gold nanoantennas (MGNs) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells
in vitro. The unique geometry of MGNs enables the generation of mild
hyperthermia (∼42 °C) by converting near-infrared light
to heat and effectively delivering doxorubicin (DOX) from the LTSLs
in breast cancer cells. We confirmed the cellular uptake of MGNs by
using both fluorescence confocal Z-stack imaging and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) imaging. We performed a cellular viability
assay and live/dead cell fluorescence imaging of the combined therapeutic
effects of MGNs with DOX-loaded LTSLs (DOX-LTSLs) and compared them
with free DOX and DOX-loaded non-temperature-sensitive liposomes (DOX-NTSLs).
Imaging of fluorescent live/dead cell indicators and MTT assay outcomes
both demonstrated significant decreases in cellular viability when
cells were treated with the combination therapy. Because of the high
phase-transition temperature of NTSLs, no drug delivery was observed
from the DOX-NTSLs. Notably, even at a low DOX concentration of 0.5
μg/mL, the combination treatment resulted in a higher (33%)
cell death relative to free DOX (17% cell death). The results of our
work demonstrate that the synergistic therapeutic effect of photothermal
hyperthermia of MGNs with drug delivery from the LTSLs can successfully
eradicate aggressive breast cancer cells with higher efficacy than
free DOX by providing a controlled light-activated approach and minimizing
off-target toxicity.

Introduction
Nanostructures have
been used as carriers for transporting cargo
where drug delivery is controlled endogenously by biological cues,
such as pH or ions,1−4 or exogenously by plasmonic photothermal materials with near-infrared-light-triggered
release. Plasmonic gold nanostructure-mediated drug delivery has been
extensively studied in the past decade to combat cancer and other
inflammatory diseases.5−11 There are several advantages to exploiting the light-to-heat conversion
abilities of gold nanostructures for exogenous control of drug delivery.
First, by tuning the laser flux density and nanostructure concentration,
the light-triggered approach generates mild hyperthermia (40–43
°C) that is sufficient for drug release with minimal damage to
healthy tissue.12−14 Second, light activation enables controlled drug
delivery at the tumor site while minimizing off-target toxicity. Third,
photothermal hyperthermia is highly localized and noninvasive, thus
eliminating the need for whole-body heating or invasive heating probes
used in current clinical hyperthermia. Finally, hyperthermia improves
vascular permeability and increases blood perfusion in the hypoxic
tumor areas, thereby enhancing drug uptake and therapeutic efficacy.15−17 For example, plasmonic nanostructures have been combined with thermoresponsive
polymers for controlled delivery.18,19 In this work,
we demonstrate the use of multibranched gold nanoantennas (MGNs) as
photothermal actuators to induce delivery of the anticancer drug doxorubicin
(DOX) from low-temperature-sensitive liposomes (LTSLs). The intense
photothermal properties of MGNs are attributed to their unique geometry
where each spherical core behaves as an antenna absorbing near-infrared
light and the protrusions act as emitters localizing the absorbed
light at the tips, thus efficiently converting light to heat.20,21 The 50–60 nm size of MGNs is ideal for these studies, enabling
rapid endocytosis and accumulation in cells.22−25 Further, their straightforward
synthesis in aqueous media with a nontoxic ligand, 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazin-1-yl]ethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES), improves their biocompatibility for cancer treatments.

LTSLs, currently under phase III clinical trial (Thermodox, Celsion
Inc.), are ideal drug delivery vehicles because of their low phase-transition
temperature, Tm, of ∼41.7 °C.26,27 This enables drug release at mild hyperthermia, minimizing unnecessary
heating of healthy tissues. Their size can be controlled to ∼100
nm, which favors particle accumulation in the tumor microenvironment
through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect.23,28 Further, they have high drug-loading efficiency and minimal drug
leakage at physiological temperature, which can reduce the toxic side
effects of chemotherapy.29,30 LTSLs have been shown
to deliver 25 times more DOX into tumors than an IV infusion of unencapsulated
DOX and 5 times more DOX than Doxil (commercial non-temperature-sensitive
liposomal formulation of DOX).26 For enhanced
utility of LTSLs, improved hyperthermia strategies that are noninvasive
and administer heat uniformly throughout the cancerous tissue are
necessary. However, current clinical approaches to induce local hyperthermia
can be invasive, which requires a heating probe directly in contact
with solid tumors (e.g., radiofrequency ablation) or can give rise
to heterogeneous tumor temperatures (e.g., ultrasonic energy), resulting
in unpredictable drug release and toxicity to healthy tissues.31−34

Here, we demonstrate that MGN-mediated photothermal heating
triggered
by near-infrared light enables DOX delivery from LTSLs with high efficiency.
Co-delivering liposomes and nanoantennas has several advantages over
encapsulating nanoantennas within the liposomes. First, co-delivery
allows loading a higher amount of drug into the liposomes. Second,
by co-delivering, the size of the liposomes can be controlled to ∼100
nm, increasing their accumulation in cancer cells. Third, co-delivery
also enables more nanostructures to localize in cells for enhanced
photothermal transduction and drug delivery from liposomes. Finally,
nanostructure encapsulation in the liposomes is typically achieved
by random mixing of the two components, which often results in unsuccessful
encapsulation and compromises the overall functionality of the hybrid
structure. Therefore, by co-delivering MGNs and LTSLs, we observe
that the MGN-mediated release of DOX from LTSLs far surpasses that
from non-thermal-sensitive liposomes (NTSLs) under similar conditions
because the phase-transition temperature of NTSLs is above the clinically
relevant hyperthermia range (40–43 °C). Furthermore, our
work shows that the combination treatment of MGN-mediated photothermal
hyperthermia with LTSL-delivered chemotherapy has a higher therapeutic
efficacy in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) than with free DOX
or photothermal therapy with MGNs alone. TNBC is highly aggressive
and is known to develop multidrug resistance (MDR), limiting the successful
usage of many chemotherapy drugs, including DOX.35−37 Photothermal
hyperthermia has been shown to reverse resistance to several anticancer
drugs,38,39 which is particularly useful because MDR
cells do not exhibit cross-resistance to hyperthermia.40−42 We envision that a combination treatment with LTSLs and plasmonic
nanostructures will ultimately provide a clinically relevant platform
for noninvasive drug delivery to treat TNBC.

Results and Discussion
We synthesized MGNs by following our previously described procedure
using a one-step seedless growth mechanism.21 In this synthesis, the gold precursor Au3+ is reduced
in the presence of 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazin-1-yl]ethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES), which plays the role of both a reducing and a capping
agent. HEPES is a widely used biological buffer that promotes the
overall biocompatibility of MGNs. The weak adsorption of HEPES along
the ⟨111⟩ planes enables kinetically driven protrusion
growth along that direction, where the core-to-protrusion ratio is
controlled by [HEPES]. By using 270 mM HEPES, the size of MGNs (tip-to-tip
distance) was controlled to 56 ± 4 nm (Figure 1a), which is ideal for therapeutic applications.
This size regime tunes the plasmon resonance of MGNs to the near-infrared
biological window (700–980 nm) where deep tissue penetration
can be achieved with the incident light.43 The MGNs have three distinct plasmon resonances (Figure 1b): a bonding plasmon mode
at 800 nm, an antibonding plasmon mode at 550 nm, and a shoulder peak
at 1100 nm. The antibonding mode is primarily contributed by the core
plasmons, whereas the bonding plasmon resonance is predominantly composed
of MGN protrusions but with a finite contribution of the core plasmons.21,44 The shoulder peak arises from the hybridization of the plasmons
of multiple protrusions of an MGN.45 The
MGNs were further coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to enhance
biocompatibility, reduce cytotoxicity, and provide steric stabilization.46−50 Successful PEG coating was confirmed by detecting a clear 10 nm
shift in the plasmon resonance (Figure 1b) because of the higher refractive index of PEG relative
to water. A decrease in the surface charge of MGNs is also indicative
of successful PEG coating. The surface charge of the MGNs before coating
was −35.3 mV, which was reduced to −2.9 mV after PEG
coating. A near-neutral surface charge on nanoparticles is desirable
to reduce nonspecific binding of MGNs to the cell surface.22,51−54

particle density and laser flux.

The light-to-heat conversion ability of MGNs was studied
to evaluate
their photothermal efficiency and efficacy in drug delivery from LTSLs.
The photothermal behavior of MGNs in cellular media was evaluated
at four different concentrations (80, 110, 140, and 170 μg/mL)
by illuminating with an 808 nm laser at 5.5 W/cm2 (Figure 1c) and measuring
the media temperature over time with a thermal camera. With 170 μg/mL
of PEG-coated MGNs, the temperature within the laser spot reached
57 °C within a minute of illumination. Varying the laser flux
(4, 5.5, and 7 W/cm2) revealed a linear relationship between
photothermal temperature and MGN concentrations (Figures 1d and S1). The light-to-heat conversion by MGNs is initiated by
the electronic excitation of MGNs followed by relaxation, which gives
rise to rapid nonequilibrium heating of the metal. This is followed
by cooling to equilibrium, during which heat is dissipated from the
MGNs into the surrounding medium. This dissipated heat is then harnessed
by the LTSLs, enabling efficient drug delivery.55

The photothermal ability of MGNs was exploited to
enable light-activated
drug release from the LTSLs with a phase-transition temperature (Tm) of ∼41.7 °C. We synthesized LTSLs
following a previously described procedure56−58 by mixing the
lipids DPPC–MSPC–DSPE-PEG2000 at a 90:10:4 ratio in
chloroform.59,60 The desired size of 110.1 ±
6.5 nm (Figure S2a) of LTSLs was achieved
by reverse-phase evaporation and subsequent extrusion. At the Tm of the LTSLs, the fully extended hydrocarbon
chains of the lipids transform into a disordered liquid crystalline
phase, enabling drugs to diffuse through the bilayer membrane.27 To evaluate the drug release ability of LTSLs,
DOX was loaded into the LTSLs using the well-established pH-gradient
method.61−63 This approach resulted in ∼98% DOX encapsulation
efficiency within the LTSLs. Rapid release of DOX from the LTSLs (within
5 min) with a 90% efficiency was achieved at a mild hyperthermia temperature
of 42 °C (Figure 2a). At a higher temperature, 45 °C, >97% of DOX was released
from the LTSLs in less than 5 min. The long-term stability of the
DOX-loaded LTSLs (DOX-LTSLs) at 37 °C was also evaluated for
12 h (Figure S3). DOX leakage studies showed
that <5% of DOX escaped from the LTSLs at 37 °C, demonstrating
a very low cytotoxicity of LTSLs at physiological temperature (Figures 2a and S3a). Highly efficient and rapid drug release
from LTSLs with mild hyperthermia enhances the bioavailability of
the chemotherapy drug in cancer cells with minimal damage to healthy
cells. We also compared the drug delivery efficacy of LTSLs with the
traditional nontemperature sensitive liposomal DOX formulation, NTSLs.
The NTSLs were synthesized by mixing the lipids HSPC–CHOL–DSPE-PEG2000
in a molar ratio of 75:50:3 and a hydrodynamic diameter of 152.7 ±
0.7 nm (Figure S2b) was achieved.64,65 DOX was loaded in the NTSLs similar to the procedure followed for
LTSLs. DOX release studies were performed, demonstrating <10% release
at all three temperatures, 37, 42, and 45 °C (Figure 2b). In additional, long-term
stability of the DOX-loaded NTSLs (DOX-NTSLs) also shows minimal DOX
leakage from NTSLs (Figure S3b).

and (b) DOX-NTSLs. (c) Confocal images of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer
cells incubated with DOX-LTSLs (left panel), DOX-NTSLs (middle panel),
and free DOX (right panel) at 2 μg DOX/mL. The cancer cells
were incubated at 37 and 42 °C for 15 min and cellular viability
was assessed 30 h after treatment. The cells were stained with calcein
(live cells, green) and propidium iodide (PI) (dead cells, red).

The therapeutic ability of LTSLs
in controlled drug release was
evaluated in MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells (Figure 2c). TNBC is one of the most lethal types
of breast cancer because of its lack of response to endocrine treatment
and other targeted therapies.66,67 Neoadjuvant and adjuvant
chemotherapy currently remain the backbone of treatment in TNBC.68 The survival of MDA-MB-231 cells was compared
after treatment with DOX-LTSLs, DOX-NTSLs, and free DOX for 15 min
at 37 and 42 °C to evaluate the effectiveness of LTSLs as chemotherapy
drug carriers to treat TNBC. After 15 min, all cells were left undisturbed
at 37 °C for 30 h to induce apoptosis. A live/dead cell assay
was performed by staining live cells with calcein and dead cells with
PI. Free DOX (2 μg/mL) resulted in cell death at both temperatures
(37 and 42 °C), showing its severe toxicity at physiological
temperatures, which leads to off-target cell death with chemotherapy
(Figure 2c, right panel).
DOX-NTSLs did not induce cell death at either temperature, showing
unsuccessful drug delivery from NTSLs with mild hyperthermia (Figure 2c, middle panel).
Notably, the DOX-LTSLs were not cytotoxic to cells at physiological
temperature, and the drug release was triggered only at their phase-transition
temperature (42 °C), resulting in cell death (Figure 2c, left panel). These results
reinforce the temperature controllability of drug release for LTSLs,
an advantage for co-delivery strategies with plasmonic nanostructures.

By co-delivering MGNs with the LTSLs in breast cancer cells, the
photothermal ability of MGNs is harnessed to directly release DOX
in the cells for a highly controlled, light-activated cancer therapy.
We confirmed MGNs internalization in the cells by using three different
approaches—phase contrast imaging (Figure S4), confocal fluorescence imaging (Figure 3a,b), and TEM imaging (Figure 3c–e). To visualize cellular uptake,
the PEG-coated MGNs were covalently conjugated to fluorescent tag
Alexa Fluor 647 via an amide bond (details in the Materials and Methods section) and incubated with MDA-MB-231
cells for 24 h and then imaged with a confocal microscope. At time
point zero when the Alexa Fluor-conjugated MGNs were added to the
culture media, Z-stack confocal fluorescence images show that no MGNs
were co-localized at the same focal plane of the cells (Figure 3a). Here, the cells are stained
green with calcein and the Alexa Fluor-conjugated MGNs appear as red
fluorescence. Following 24 h of incubation, clear red fluorescence
from the Alexa Fluor-conjugated MGNs was observed inside of the cells
(Figure 3b). The orthogonal
view of the Z-stack image (right and bottom panels in Figure 3b) confirmed that the MGNs
were localized inside of the cells in both x–z and y–z directions.
To further confirm the uptake and distribution of MGNs inside of the
cells, TEM micrographs of MDA-MB-231 cells were obtained after 24
h of incubation with the PEG-coated MGNs (Figure 3c–e). The dark clusters in Figure 3c indicate that the
MGNs were endocytosed in cells and entrapped in membrane-bound cytoplasmic
vesicles.69,70 We note that the MGNs were not observed
in the nucleus (indicated by an arrow in Figure 3c) or the mitochondria (indicated by arrows
in Figure 3d). The
high-magnification TEM micrograph (Figure 3e) shows that the PEG-coated MGNs maintained
their characteristic anisotropic morphologies even upon cellular internalization.

(right panel in b) at both x–z and y–z direction show
that PEG-coated MGNs were delivered into the cells. (c–e) TEM
micrographs of PEG-coated MGNs show internalization by the cells and
localization in the intracellular vesicles. In addition, PEG-coated
MGNs were neither found in the nucleus indicated by an arrow in (c)
nor in the mitochondria indicated by arrows in (d). High magnification
micrograph in (e) shows that MGNs maintain their anisotropic morphology
in cells.

Following the uptake of PEG-coated
MGNs, the cells were incubated
with either DOX-LTSLs or DOX-NTSLs at 2 μg DOX/mL and subsequently
treated with an 808 nm laser at 5.5 W/cm2 for 15 min (Scheme S1). An infrared camera was used to monitor
the temperature elevation during laser irradiation (Figure S5a). The temperature profile of the cellular media
with the MGNs during these in vitro experiments is shown in Figure S5b. We note that at this laser flux,
the MGNs generated 42 ± 1 °C in the culture dish within
the laser beam (3–3.5 mm2 spot size), sufficient
to release DOX from the LTSLs. Three hours post laser treatment, the
culture media was removed and the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) buffer. The cells were then stained with Hoechst and
imaged with a confocal microscope. The cellular uptake and translocation
of DOX into the nucleus were visualized by utilizing the intrinsic
fluorescence of DOX (excitation at 488 nm, emission at ∼570
nm).71 After drug delivery, a concentration
gradient of DOX is generated across the cellular membrane which drives
DOX influx into the cells; DOX then translocates into the nucleus.72−74 DOX is known to induce cytotoxicity through both the inhibition
of DNA synthesis and the production of free radicals.75,76 Confocal fluorescent images demonstrate the ability of LTSLs to
successfully deliver DOX into the cells by utilizing the photothermal
hyperthermia induced by the MGNs (Figure 4, bottom panel). Because of the high phase-transition
temperature of NTSLs, no DOX delivery was achieved (Figure 4, top panel) at mild hyperthermia.

MGNs, illuminated with an 808 nm laser, and treated with either DOX-LTSLs
(bottom) or DOX-NTSLs (top). Left panels show the cell nucleus stained
with Hoechst, middle panels show DOX fluorescence at ∼570 nm,
and right panels are the overlay of left and middle panels, and bright

Light activation of MGNs enables
highly controlled and localized
drug delivery from the liposomes; moreover, the hyperthermia enhances
drug uptake and cytotoxicity of anticancer drugs.15,16 Mild hyperthermia improves cellular membrane permeability and alters
the physiological behavior of the cells, making them more susceptible
to apoptosis.43,77−79 We have performed
both fluorescence imaging (Figure 5) and MTT viability analysis (Figure 6) to demonstrate that photothermal hyperthermia
induced by MGNs can successfully deliver DOX from LTSLs, resulting
in significant cell death. Calcein/PI live/dead cell assays were performed
in MDA-MB-231 cells that were illuminated with an 808 nm laser for
15 min. The cells were incubated with PEG-coated MGNs in the presence
of either DOX-LTSLs (Figure 5a) or DOX-NTSLs (Figure 5b). Because of the high phase-transition temperature
(>46 °C) of NTSLs, no cell death was observed with the NTSLs,
both with (Figure 5b) and without (Figure S6b) MGNs. This
demonstrates that drug delivery from NTSLs is not achievable under
the mild hyperthermia (40–43 °C) generated by MGNs. However,
the LTSLs in the presence of PEG-coated MGNs successfully released
DOX, resulting in intense cell death (Figure 5a), where dead cells were stained red with
PI. In the absence of MGNs, the DOX-LTSLs did not induce cell death,
indicating that the laser itself does not generate enough heat to
release DOX from the LTSLs (Figure S6a).
We note that unlike photothermal therapy with gold nanoparticles in
vitro where necrotic cell death occurs within the laser spot, in photothermal
drug delivery in vitro, cell death is localized in the vicinity of
the liposomes; but, because of the concentration gradient of DOX,
apoptotic cell death extends slightly beyond the laser spot. This
process has been observed previously in light-mediated drug delivery
in vitro.80,81 However, this does not imply that photothermal
DOX release in vivo will pose a risk of off-target toxicity because
DOX remains within the tumor microenvironment, and successful tumor
treatment with this approach has been shown previously.8 Apoptotic cell death by a chemotherapy drug is
strongly preferred over necrotic cell death incurred during photothermal
therapy by gold nanoparticles because necrosis gives rise to uncontrollable
inflammation and undesirable immunogenic responses because of the
loss of cellular membrane integrity.82,83 To confirm
apoptotic cell death, Annexin was used to stain the phosphatidylserine
of apoptotic cells 16 h post treatment with PEG-coated MGNs + DOX-LTSLs
+ laser (Figure 5c).
Calcein and PI were also used to indicate live and dead cells. The
overlay image (Figure 5d) of Annexin (blue) with calcein (green) and PI (red) clearly shows
cells that were undergoing apoptosis, where the arrows indicate live
cells that were in their apoptotic cell cycle. We also performed control
experiments where MDA-MB-231 cells were not treated with MGNs or liposomes
and were further stained with Annexin (Figure S7). Only a few of these control cells underwent normal cell
cycle and apoptosis. We note that the particle density of the MGNs
utilized in this study is not significant enough to induce cell death
via photothermal heating. Moreover, the MGNs alone (Figure S8a) or laser alone at 5.5 W/cm2 does not
induce significant cell death (Figure S8b).

from (a) and shown separately for clarity. All samples for this assay
were illuminated with an 808 nm laser at 5.5 W/cm2 for
15 min. The error bars represent n = 4 samples. Data
are shown as mean ± standard deviation.

Quantitative assessment of the therapeutic outcome of photothermal
drug delivery was achieved with MTT cellular viability assays (Figure 6a). The MDA-MB-231
cells were incubated with different concentrations of DOX-LTSLs, DOX-NTSLs,
and free DOX for 12 h both with and without PEG-coated MGNs. At a
low DOX concentration (0.5 or 2 μg/mL), DOX-LTSLs and DOX-NTSLs
did not induce significant cell death, showing >90% survival. The
cellular viability decreased to ∼77% using both DOX-LTSLs and
DOX-NTSLs at a DOX concentration of 20 μg/mL, likely attributed
to the increase in liposomes uptake or leakage of DOX at such high
concentrations. Cells treated with DOX-LTSLs alone and irradiated
with an 808 nm laser did not result in significant cell death because
the laser alone does not generate sufficient heat to reach the phase-transition
temperature of LTSLs. However, the difference in the cellular viability
between cells that were treated with DOX-LTSLs + laser and cells treated
with DOX-LTSLs + MGNs + laser at all three DOX concentrations were
statistically significant (p = 0.005 for 0.5 μg/mL,
0.003 for 2 μg/mL and 0.003 for 20 μg/mL). The photothermal
hyperthermia induced by PEG-coated MGNs initiated rapid drug delivery
from DOX-LTSLs, resulting in a cellular viability of 67%, 42%, and
39% at 0.5, 2, and 20 μg/mL DOX concentrations, respectively.
Notably, the combination of MGNs with DOX-LTSLs resulted in higher
cell death than that caused by free DOX alone at all three concentrations
of DOX (84%, 50%, and 43%). For clarity, we also replotted the MTT
assay data from Figure 6a for the DOX-LTSLs samples (DOX-LTSLs, DOX-LTSLs + laser, and DOX-LTSLs
+ MGNs + laser) to clearly show that a significantly higher cell death
is observed because of DOX release from the LTSLs in the presence
of MGNs (Figure 6b).
Because NTSLs are not thermally responsive at mild hyperthermia, negligible
cell death was observed for all cells incubated with DOX-NTSLs independent
of the presence of MGNs. Our results convey that the MGN-mediated
mild hyperthermia results in a successful drug delivery from LTSLs
with high therapeutic efficacy below the United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)-approved DOX concentration. FDA standards for
DOX treatment in a 60 kg adult human is ∼2 μg/mL every
3 weeks, not to exceed a total of 13.5 μg/mL.84−86 In summary,
whereas free DOX will induce toxicity even in healthy cells when translated
to a clinical setting, targeted photothermal drug delivery with MGNs
is light-activated, is highly controlled, and can minimize off-target
toxicities.

Conclusions
In this study, we synergistically combined
the therapeutic effects
of PEG-coated MGNs with DOX-LTSLs to eliminate aggressive TNBC cells
with a highly controlled, light-activated approach. The unique nanoantenna-like
geometry of MGNs, consisting of a core with multiple sharp protrusions,
enables strong light-to-heat conversion, allowing rapid and highly
efficient drug delivery from LTSLs. We chose a model TNBC cell line,
MDA-MB-231, to assess both qualitatively (calcein/PI live/dead cell
assay and apoptosis assay) and quantitatively (MTT assay) the therapeutic
outcome of MGNs combined with DOX-LTSLs. Our results provide strong
evidence that photothermal heating by the MGNs gives rise to mild
hyperthermia sufficient to reach the phase-transition temperature
of LTSLs, resulting in 58% cell death at a DOX concentration of 2
μg/mL. We envision that the co-delivery of LTSLs with MGNs will
ultimately facilitate a clinically applicable technology, enabling
the delivery of dose-controlled treatment and minimizing off-target
toxicities that are associated with chemotherapy. Future integration
of this approach to include imaging capabilities would enable longitudinal
tracking to further improve detection, treatment, and assessment of
therapeutic outcomes with a platform that can be externally triggered
by near-infrared light. In addition, LTSLs can ultimately be loaded
with a range of drugs, and when combined with MGNs, this platform
will facilitate targeted treatment of multiple diseases, including
cancer, multiple sclerosis, and many infectious diseases.

Materials and
Methods
Synthesis of PEG-MGNs
All reagents were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich except methoxy-polyethylene glycol-thiol (mPEG-SH, Mw 5000, JenKem Technology). The MGNs were synthesized
through the one-step HEPES-mediated growth method.21 First, 18 mL of Milli-Q water (18 MΩ) was added to
12 mL of 270 mM HEPES (pH 7.40 ± 0.2). Then, 300 μL of
20 mM chloroauric acid (HAuCl4) was mixed with the HEPES
solution through gentle inversion and left to react at room temperature
for 75 min. To PEGylate the MGNs, 3 mL of 50 μM mPEG-SH was
added to the MGNs and reacted at 4 °C for 24 h.87,88 After the reaction, the MGN solution was centrifuged at 6000 rpm
for 20 min while discarding the supernatant and resuspending the pellet
in 2 mL of Milli-Q water. To ensure complete surface PEGylation, a
second addition of mPEG-SH was performed (100 μL of 5 μM
mPPEG-SH) for 10 min with constant stirring. Lastly, the PEG-coated
MGNs were washed with Milli-Q water twice to remove excess chemicals.

Characterization of PEG-Coated MGNs
The PEG-coated
MGNs were imaged with an Osiris transmission electron microscope at
200 keV to evaluate their size and morphology. The absorbance properties
of the MGNs and the PEG-coated MGNs were characterized using a Varian
Cary 5000 UV–vis near-infrared spectrophotometer. A Malvern
Nano ZS dynamic light-scattering apparatus was used to measure the
zeta potential of the MGNs before and after PEGylation.

Photothermal
Ability of PEG-Coated MGNs
Laser optics
used for this project were purchased from Thorlabs. The optics included
an 808 nm laser diode (L808P1WJ), a current controller (LDC240C),
a thermoelectric controller (TEDC300C), a collimating lens (C230TME-B),
and a silver-polished mirror (PF-10-03-P01). Calipers and a power
meter (Thorlabs, PM100D) were used to measure the laser spot size
and power density.

PEG-MGNs at four different concentrations,
80, 110, 140, and 170 μg/mL, were mixed with a complete cellular
media, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Gibco)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, ATCC). The solution
was preheated to 37 °C, added to a 35 mm cell culture dish, and
illuminated with the laser at 4, 5.5, and 7 W/cm2 for 20
min. To mimic the biological environment, the temperature was kept
constant by using a temperature controller and a heating mantle. The
culture dishes with the PEG-coated MGNs suspensions were placed on
top of an aluminum block wrapped with antireflecting black films atop
the heating mantle. The temperature of the solution was monitored
using an infrared camera (FLIR T400), taking images incrementally
over time.

Synthesis of DOX-Loaded Liposomes
All lipids, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine
(DPPC), 1-stearoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(MSPC), 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene glycol)-2000] (DSPE-PEG2000), cholesterol,
and hydrogenated-l-α-phosphatidylcholine (HSPC) were
purchased from Avanti Polar Lipid. Doxorubicin hydrochloride was purchased
from Fisher Scientific.

LTSLs and NTSLs were synthesized by
a reverse-phase evaporation method.56−58 Briefly, 5 mg of lipid
(for LTSLs: DPPC–MSPC–DSPE-PEG2000 = 90:10:4; for NTSLs:
HSPC–CHOL–DSPE-PEG2000 = 75:50:3 in molar ratio)59,60,64,65 was dissolved in 1 mL of chloroform, then dried using nitrogen air
and subsequent vacuum. To form the liposomes, the lipid film was hydrated
with a 300 mM citrate buffer (pH 4.0) for 60 min (at 55 °C for
LTSLs and 60 °C for NTSLs). The liposomes were then extruded
10 times through a 400 nm and a 100 nm polycarbonate membrane to obtain
the desired size. The outside pH of the liposome solution was titrated
to pH 7.5 using 0.5 M sodium carbonate. As a result, a pH gradient
was generated across the lipid bilayer.61−63 DOX was then added to
the liposome solution at a 1:20 DOX/lipid weight ratio and mixed for
60 min (at 37 °C for LTSLs and 60 °C for NTSLs). The final
product was passed through a PD10 column to remove excess DOX.

Characterization
of DOX-Loaded Liposomes
A Malvern
Nano ZS dynamic light-scattering apparatus was used to measure the
hydrodynamic size of DOX-LTSLs and DOX-NTSLs. The encapsulation efficiency
(EE) of DOX was monitored at 480 nm by using UV–vis spectroscopy.89 Triton X-100 (2% wt/v) was added to the DOX-LTSLs
and NTSLs solution to fully lyse the liposomes.

Temperature-Triggered
DOX Release Measurement
DOX release
from the LTSLs and NTSLs was monitored at three different temperatures,
37, 42, and 45 °C. First, 0.9 mL of 25 mM HEPES buffer saline
(HBS) was prewarmed in an incubator to the above-listed temperatures.
At time zero, 100 μL of DOX-LTSLs or DOX-NTSLs was added to
the HBS and incubated for a given time point. Dequenching of DOX fluorescence
was monitored at 480 nm using a UV–vis spectrophotometer.89 Cumulative drug release was calculated by  where At, A0, and A∞ are the absorbances at a given time point, at time
zero, and when the liposomes were fully lysed with Triton X-100, respectively.

Confocal Fluorescence Imaging of Cellular Internalization of
PEG-Coated MGNs
Alexa Fluor 647 NHS Ester conjugate (ThermoFisher
Scientific) was attached to the PEG-coated MGNs through an OPSS-PEG-amine
(JenKem Technology) linker, which creates a covalent amide bond between
the NHS ester and amine. Alexa Fluor was mixed with the OPSS-PEG-amine
linker in a 3:1 molar ratio at room temperature for 2 h. The product
was then added to the MGN solution and reacted at 4 °C for 3
h. An additional mPEG-SH layer was then added to the fluorophore-conjugated
MGNs for further stability. The final product was centrifuged at 4000
rpm for 10 min. The Alexa-conjugated MGNs were added to the cells
and incubated for 24 h. Calcein was used to stain the live cells.
Z-stack images were taken at both time zero (when the MGNs were just
added to the cells) and after 24 h of MGNs incubation. A Zeiss LSM
710 confocal microscope was used for the imaging.

TEM Imaging
of Cellular Uptake of PEG-Coated MGNs
MDA-MB-231
cells were incubated with the PEG-coated MGNs for 24 h. The cells
were then washed with a buffer, fixed in 2.5% gluteraldehyde in 0.1
M cacodylate buffer at room temperature for 1 h and 4 °C overnight.
The samples were processed and imaged in the Vanderbilt Cell Imaging
Shared Resource Research Electron Microscope facility. The cell samples
were post-fixed in 1% osmium tetraoxide at room temperature and then
washed with a 0.1 M cacodylate buffer 3 times. Following fixation,
the samples were dehydrated through a graded ethanol series followed
by incubation in 100% ethanol and propylene oxide (PO) and 2 exchanges
of pure PO. Lastly, the samples were embedded in epoxy resin and polymerized
at 60 °C for 48 h. To obtain thin sections of the sample, 70–80
nm ultra-thin sections were cut from the block and collected on copper
grids. The copper grids were stained with 2% uranyl acetate and lead
citrate. The samples were imaged on a Philips/FEI Tecnai T12 electron
microscope at different magnifications.

In Vitro Temperature-Triggered
Release of DOX
MDA-MB-231
cells were purchased from ATCC (HTB-26) and cultured in DMEM supplemented
with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were maintained
at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Forty-eight hours before the
experiments, 330 000 cells were seeded on a 35 mm cell culture
dish. On the day of the experiment, fresh media containing DOX-LTSLs,
DOX-NTSLs, or DOX at 2 μg DOX/mL was added to the cells. The
cells were incubated at either 37 or 42 °C for 15 min. After
12 h, the media was changed to fresh cDMEM and cultured for an additional
18 h. The cells were stained with calcein (5 μM) and PI (1 μM)
for 20 min. A Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope was used for fluorescence
imaging of the cells.

In Vitro Photothermal Drug Delivery and Fluorescence
Imaging
MDA-MB-231 cells were passaged for at least 14 days
before seeding
for the experiment. Approximately, 11 000 cells per well were
seeded on a 96-well plate and allowed to adhere and grow. After 48
h, 65 μL of PEG-coated MGNs (170 μg/mL) in DMEM were added
to the cells and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The media was then
removed, and the cells were washed with cDMEM twice. A Zeiss Observer
Z1 microscope was used to visualize the cellular uptake of PEG-coated
MGNs.

To show the DOX release by LTSLs or NTSLs (Figure 4), 24 h after MGNs incubation,
DOX-LTSLs at 2 μg/mL were added to the cells. The cells were
then allowed an hour to equilibrate. After an hour, an 808 nm laser
was applied to the cells and illuminated at 5.5 ± 0.1 W/cm2 for 15 min with a laser spot size of approximately 3.5 mm2. An infrared camera was used to monitor the temperature changes
during laser irradiation (see Figure S5). The culture media was removed 3 h post laser treatment and washed
with PBS twice. This process removed any LTSLs (or NTSLs) from the
cells, but DOX that was already released from the LTSLs (or NTSLs)
remained internalized in the cells. The cells were then stained with
Hoechst and imaged with a confocal microscope.

For in vitro
photothermal therapeutic study (Figures 5 and 6), a similar
procedure was followed as stated above. However, the culture media
was changed to fresh cDMEM 12 h after laser irradiation instead of
3 h after laser treatment. The cells were left undisturbed (with the
fresh media) for an additional 18 h. Thus, after a total of 30 h post
laser treatment, the cells were stained with calcein and PI and imaged
using the confocal microscope to evaluate the cellular viability qualitatively.
The timeline of the experiment is shown in Scheme S1. For apoptosis study, Annexin V and Pacific Blue (ThermoFisher
Scientific) at 25/100 μL were used to stain the cells 16 h post
laser treatment.

Cellular Viability Assay
MDA-MB-231
cells were passaged
and seeded identically on 96-well plates as stated previously. The
cells were incubated with 170 μg/mL PEG-coated MGNs for 24 h
and washed with the cell medium twice. DOX-LTSLs or DOX-NTSLs at DOX
concentrations of 0.5, 2, and 20 μg/mL were then added to the
cells. An 808 nm laser at 5.5 W/cm2 was applied for 15
min. The drug was removed, and the culture media was refreshed after
12 h of laser irradiation. After an additional 18 h of incubation
(30 h total), the old media was removed and replaced with 100 μL
of fresh media mixed with 10 μL of 12 mM 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide solution (MTT, ThermoFisher Scientific). After 2 h of MTT
incubation, 85 μL of media was removed and 50 μL of dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to solubilize and dissolve the formazan.
A Biotek Synergy H1 plate reader was used to read the absorbance at
540 nm.
