Degradation
and recycling of cured thermosetting epoxy resins are
major challenges to the industry. Here, a low-viscosity, degradable
epoxy-ended hyperbranched polyester (DEHP) is synthesized by a reaction
between epichlorohydrin and a carboxyl-ended hyperbranched polyester
(DCHP) obtained from an esterification between citric acid and maleic
anhydride. The chemical structures of DCHP and DEHP were characterized
by Fourier transform infrared and 1H NMR. DEHP has a positive
effect on reinforcing and toughening of the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A
(DGEBA). With an increase in the content and molecular weight of DEHP,
the mechanical performances of the cured DEHP/DGEBA composites, including
the tensile, flexural, and impact strengths, increase first and then
decrease. The improvements on the tensile, flexural, and impact strengths
were 34.2–43.4%, 35.6–48.1%, and 117.9–137.8%,
respectively. Moreover, the DEHP also promotes degradation of the
cured DEHP/DGEBA composites. The degree of degradation of the cured
DEHP/DGEBA composites increases with an increase of the DEHP content
and molecular weight. The composites containing 12 wt % DEHP can be
degraded completely in only about 2 h at about 90 °C, compared
with the degradation degree (35%) of cured DGEBA, indicating good
degradation and recycling properties of the DEHP.

Introduction
Epoxy
resins (EPs) are thermosets for a wide range of applications,
including coatings, paintings,1 adhesives,2 laminates, and composite materials due to their
high adhesion, mechanical strength, chemical resistance, and process
ability. However, the high cross-linking density3 of EPs causes brittleness,4 low
impact strength and fatigue resistance, and environmental concerns
due to poor degradability. The high viscosity of EPs is another disadvantage,
requiring large amounts of organic solvents to dilute them.5 Solid tougheners, such as blending rubbers6 and polyesters,7 have
been incorporated into EPs to improve their toughness. On the other
hand, organic solvents, often poisonous, are used to improve their
process ability.5 Recently, hyperbranched
epoxy resins (HERs) with low viscosity, high solubility,8 and high toughness have been developed. The HERs
with a large number of functional terminal groups9 as thermosetting polymers have been proved to be the best
additive for toughening commercial diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A
(DGEBA).10 It is reported that the toughness
of DGEBA increases several folds with the use of about only 10 wt
% HERs.11 HERs have now become an important
class of toughening additive for DGEBA. Many synthetic methods of
HERs have been explored, including proton transfer polymerization,12 end group modification of hyperbranched polymers,13 and atom transfer polymerization.14 However, the HERs obtained from these synthetic
techniques are in the form of a solid or a high-viscosity liquid,
which need to be diluted with thinners or organic solvents for application.
In addition, the mechanical strength is also impaired to some extent
by the addition of HERs. In 2006, our group15 synthesized a low-viscosity aromatic hyperbranched polyester EP
from epichlorohydrin, trimellitic anhydride, and diethylene glycol,
which increased not only the toughness but also the tensile strength
and flexural strength of DGEBA because of a novel in situ reinforcing
and toughening mechanism.15 HERs with a
silicone skeleton at low viscosities of 103.5–697.4 mPa s were
obtained by our group11 through an environmentally
friendly synthetic method, improving a comprehensive range of performances.

Although HERs offer improved reinforcement, especially toughness,
and process ability due to their low viscosity, degradation and recycling
of DGEBA are still a significant challenge. The traditional EPs are
usually difficult to break down or recycle due to their three-dimensional
network structure,16,17 producing solid waste which is
a heavy burden to the environment.18 The
main methods for decomposing EPs include mechanical recycling,19 pyrolysis process,20,21 supercritical fluid process,22 and biodegradation.23 In mechanical recycling, cured EPs were ground
into fine powders and then used as filler in new composites. The cured
epoxy powder from the mechanical recycling showed poor compatibility
with DGEBA due to the lack of reactive groups, resulting in poor mechanical
performance. El Gersifi24 reported a chemical
recycling process by solvolysis of EPs at 245 °C. Dang25 reported a 19 h long process to degrade EPs
cured with amine using nitric acid. These pyrolysis processes could
effectively degrade cured EPs26 at a high
temperature of about 245 °C or a long degradation time of about
19 h. Liu27 studied the degradation behaviors
of an anhydride-cured DGEBA in near-critical water at 270 °C
for 30 min. The supercritical fluid process is not effective for recycling
EPs because the solutions are not always feasible for all composites.22 Biodegradation of cured EPs takes about 48 h,28 and the degraded products are difficult to recycle
because of usage of many mineral salts.23 With the increase of EP consumption, finding an effective method
to deal with the thermosetting resin waste has become an important
research subject.

In this article, we select a degradable citric
acid as a monomer
to synthesize HERs and investigate the effect of the HER content and
molecular weight on the performances of HER/DGEBA composites. The
mechanisms for reinforcing, toughening, and degradation of HERs are
discussed in detail.

Results and Discussion
Structure Characterization
of the Carboxyl-Ended Hyperbranched
Polyester (DCHP) and Degradable Epoxy-Ended Hyperbranched Polyester
(DEHP)
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of DCHP-1,
DCHP-2, and DCHP-3 are shown in Figure S1. The wide absorption peak at around 3473 cm–1 is
attributed to the vibration of the —OH group. The strong absorption
peak at 1729 cm–1 (Figure S1) belongs to the C=O bond. The peak at 1216 cm–1 corresponds to the vibration of the C—O—C group. The
absorption peak at 1631 cm–1 belongs to the C=C
group. The appearance of the absorption peak at 1729 cm–1 and the disappearance of the peak at 1800–1880 cm–1 show that the anhydride group has reacted completely and the ester
group has been generated. The 1H NMR spectra of DCHP-1,
DCHP-2, and DCHP-3 are shown in Figure S2. The signals of protons of —CH=CH— are obtained
at δ 6.27 ppm (Ha). The peaks of the protons of —CH2— appear at δ 2.69–2.93 ppm (Hb, Hc). There is almost no change of the chemical environment
of methylene protons after esterification. So the peak of —CH2— attached with the ester group appear at the same
position as that of —CH2— attached with carboxyl.
The peak at δ 6.27 ppm becomes weaker with an increase of the
molecular weight of DCHP.

The properties of DCHP-1, DCHP-2,
and DCHP-3 are shown in Table S1. According
to the polycondensation between the hydroxyl group and carboxyl group,
the acid value of the DCHP can calculate the degree of polymerization
and further the number-average molecular weight.29 Explicit relationships between theoretical average degrees
of polymerization and average molecular weights are established in
the ABf + Bg monomer polymerization case by
“Recursive Probability Approach”,30 and X̅n, M̅n, Av, pB, and X̅w satisfy the following
relationships 1   2   3   4  Here, X̅n refers
to the number-average degree of polymerization; M̅n refers to the number-average molar mass; M0 and MAB3 refer to the molar
masses of the Bg and AB3 monomers, respectively;
the acid value (Av) refers to the number
of milligrams of the KOH, which neutralizes resin per gram; and pB refers to the fraction of B groups that reacted.

Therefore, Av and pB satisfy the following relationship 5  From eq 1 to eq 5, pA = f pB, f = 2, g = 3, the
molecular weight can
be calculated and is shown in Table S1. Table S1 illustrates that the M̅n values of DCHP by the “Recursive Probability
Approach” are very close to their theoretical molecular weights.

The FT-IR and 1H NMR spectra of DEHP-1, DEHP-2, and
DEHP-3 are shown in Figures S3 and S4.
The peak at 1739 cm–1 (Figure S3) is attributed to the absorption peak of the C=O
group. The appearance of the peaks at 1240, 910, and 844 cm–1 suggests the formation of the epoxy group. 1H NMR spectral
data of DEHP in DMSO-d6: δ 6.1 ppm
(a), 2.79 ppm (b, c), 3.81–4.21 ppm (d, e), 3.17 ppm (f), and
2.5–2.63 ppm (g, h). The strong peaks at 2.10 (n) and 3.30
(m) ppm belong to the solvent peak of DMSO-d6. After epoxidation, the positions of Ha and Hb, Hc change to 6.1 and 2.79 ppm, respectively.
The presence of the epoxy group is confirmed by the signals 3.17 and
2.5–2.63 ppm. The chemical shifts at 3.81–4.21 ppm are
attributable to —CH2— attached with the epoxy
unit.

The properties of DEHP-1, DEHP-2, and DEHP-3 are shown
in Table S2. The main characteristics of
the DEHP
are the low epoxy equivalent weight and low viscosity, from Table S2. The low epoxy equivalent weight can
increase their curing rate and cross-linking density. The viscosity
is measured by the discovery hybrid rheometer (TA Instruments) at
25 °C. The viscosity of DEHP-2 is only 44 cp, suggesting a potential
application in solvent-free resins.

Mechanical Performance
DEHP has a remarkable effect
to increase the impact, tensile, and flexural strengths of DGEBA.
The effects of the content and molecular weight of DEHP on these mechanical
properties are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Effects of the molecular weight and content of DEHP on the (a)
impact, (b) tensile, and (c) flexural strengths of DEHP/DGEBA composites.

With an increase of the molecular
weight of DEHP, the mechanical
performance of the DEHP/DGEBA composites increased first and then
decreased. The impact strength of cured 12 wt % DEHP-1/DGEBA, 12 wt
% DEHP-2/DGEBA, and 12 wt % DEHP-2/DGEBA increased about 117.9, 137.8,
and 126.1% compared to that (17.1 kJ/m2) of the cured DGEBA,
in Figure 1. Also,
their tensile strengths increased about 34.2, 43.4, and 40.0%, respectively,
and their flexural strengths increased about 35.6, 48.1, and 40.7%,
respectively.

The mechanical performances of the DEHP/DGEBA
composites increased
first and then decreased with an increase of the DEHP content. The
best mechanical performance was achieved by the composite with 12
wt % DEHP-2, which demonstrated 137.8, 43.4, and 48.1% increases in
the impact, tensile, and flexural strengths of DGEBA, respectively.
DEHP-1 and DEHP-3 are expected to have similar effect on toughening
and reinforcing of DGEBA as that of DEHP-2.

The improvement
of the mechanical performance of the DEHP/DGEBA
composites can be explained as follows. The intramolecular cavities31 formed from the non-cross-linkable hyperbranched
structure of DEHP would be responsible for the improved toughness,
but the intramolecular cavities would have a negative effect on the
tensile and flexural strengths of the composites.11 The increase of the cross-linking density in the composites
would improve the tensile and flexural strengths. In other words,
intramolecular cavities and high cross-linking density have opposite
effects on the mechanical properties of the composites. The incorporation
of 12 wt % DEHP and medium molecular weight of DEHP provided the right
balance to achieve outstanding toughness as well as excellent tensile
and flexural strengths.

Thermal Performance
The glass-transition
temperatures
(Tg) of the composites are shown in Figure 2a,b. The effects
of the DEHP content and molecular weight on the thermal degradation
temperature of the DEHP/DGEBA composites are shown in Figure 2c,d. The relative mass loss
is shown in Table S3.

Figure 2 Differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC) (a, b) and thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) (c, d) curves of the DEHP/DGEBA composites at different
DEHP contents and molecular weights.

The results in Figure 2a show that Tg decreased with
the increase of both the DEHP-2 content and the molecular weight.
A possible explanation for the decrease of Tg may be that the aliphatic flexible chains increased by the
introduction of DEHP. With the increase of the molecular weight and
content of DEHP in the composites, both the starting thermal degradation
temperature and the rate of degradation decreased. This decrease in
turn may be caused by the decrease of rigid benzene in the composites
due to the introduction of DEHP.

Reinforcing and Toughening
Mechanism
The scanning electron
micrographs of the fracture surfaces of the DGEBA and DEHP/DGEBA composites
are shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs of the impact fracture
surface of the cured composites for (a) pure DGEBA, (b) 3 wt % DEHP-2/DGEBA,
(c) 6 wt % DEHP-2/DGEBA, (d) 9 wt % DEHP-2/DGEBA, (e) 12 wt % DEHP-2/DGEBA,
(f) 15 wt % DEHP-2/DGEBA, (g) 12 wt % DEHP-1/DGEBA, and (h) 12 wt
% DEHP-3/DGEBA.

The obvious smooth fracture
surface of DGEBA in Figure 3 shows that it is a brittle
material. The striations on the fracture surface of the DEHP/DGEBA
composites suggest good toughness. As shown in Figure 3, the density of the stripes increased with
an increase of the DEHP content and molecular weight. The mechanism
can be explained with an “in situ” reinforcing and toughening
mechanism.32−34 The non-cross-linkable hyperbranched structure in
DEHP forms intramolecular cavities,31 which
would distort and form the stripes upon impacting. Thus, the amount
of stripes increases with the increase of the non-cross-linkable hyperbranched
structure, which improves the toughness of the DEHP/DGEBA composites
over DGEBA.

The dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) curves of
the cured DGEBA
and DEHP/DGEBA composites for the −100 to 190 °C temperature
range are presented in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Tan δ (a, b) and storage modulus (c, d) curves of cured DEHP/DGEBA
composites and cured DGEBA.

The α-relaxation peak measured from DMA in Figure 4a,b is related to
the Tg. It can be seen that the α-relaxation
peak for the cured DEHP/DGEBA composites shifts toward a lower temperature
with the increase in the content and molecular weight of DEHP. The
change of Tg agrees with the results from
the DSC curves in Figure 1. The increase of aliphatic flexible chains caused by the
increase in the content and molecular weight of DEHP leads to the
decrease in Tg. The β-relaxation
peak measured from DMA indicated the toughness of the composites.
The higher the β-relaxation peak, the better the toughness.
With the increase of the content and molecular weight of DEHP, the
height of the β-relaxation peak of the composites increased
and then decreased. The results agree with the change of mechanical
performance of the composites.

From Figure 4c,d,
it could be found that the storage modulus of cured DEHP/DGEBA increased
first and then decreased with the increase of the molecular weight
and content of DEHP, which is also reflected in the mechanical performance
(Figure 1). The trend
can also be explained by the balance of intramolecular cavities and
cross-linking density.

The cross-linking density of these cured
DEHP/DGEBA composites
can be calculated by the rubber elasticity model,35,36 as in eq 6 6  where Ve is the
cross-linking density, Er is the storage
modulus, φ is the front factor, R is the gas
constant, and T is the absolute temperature. The
storage modulus at Tg + 50 °C is
taken as the rubbery modulus to calculate the cross-linking density.
As shown in Figure 5, the cross-linking density increases with the increase of molecular
weight and content of DEHP.

Figure 5 Effects of the molecular weight (a) and content
(b) of DEHP on
the cross-linking density of the DEHP/DGEBA composites.

Degradation Mechanism
The chemical
structure of EPs,
cure agent, and cured resins are shown in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Chemical Structures of EPs, Cure Agent,
and Cured Resins
The degrees of degradation of the cured DEHP/DGEBA composite
films
with different DEHP contents from 0 to 15 wt % are presented in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Effect of the DEHP content
on the degradation degree.

The degradation result in Figure 6 showed that the degree of degradation of
the cured
epoxy films increased constantly with the increase of the DEHP content
and molecular weight. This is due to the presence of hydrolyzable
ester linkages of DEHP in the structure that are more easily attacked37 than the ether linkages of DGEBA.23 At the same time, the amount of ester linkages
increases with the increase in the DEHP content and molecular weight,
causing the degree of degradation to increase.

Scheme 2 Degradation Mechanism
of the Cured DEHP-2/DGEBA
The gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (GC–MS)
spectra of the degradation solutions after extraction are shown in Figures S5 and S6. From GC–MS, the degradation
products of the cured 12 wt % DEHP/DGEBA composites and the cured
DGEBA were obtained and are presented in Tables 1 and 2. The degradation
mechanism of the cured DEHP-2/DGEBA is shown in Scheme 2.

Table 1 Degradation Products
of the Cured
12 wt % DEHP-2/DGEBA Composites from Scheme 2
Table 2 Degradation Products of the Cured
DGEBA from Scheme 2
As shown in Table 1 and Figure S5, the main degradation product
(3) was about 16 wt %, being from the main molecular
chain of the reacted diethylene triamine acrylonitrile (DETA–AN).
The formation of product (3) is owing to the cleavage
of the ester and ether bonds27 and partial
cleavage of the C—N bond. The formation of (4) is similar to that of (3) except for the cleavage
of the C—N bond. Products (1)38 and (2)16 are
the results of DGEBA after degradation. Product (5), citric acid, was once again proved to be due to the cleavage of
the ester bond. In Table 2, the main products are (6) and (7), which are about 15.91% of the total. The molecular structures
of these products show that the ester and ether bonds are broken but
the C—N bonds are intact. Thus, the degradation degree of cured
DGEBA is less than that of 12 wt % DEHP/DGEBA, agreeing with the experiments.
The above analysis indicates that the introduction of DEHP can promote
effectively the degradation of cured DEHP/DGEBA composites.

Conclusions
In this study, a low-viscosity DEHP was prepared by an esterification
method. DEHP could improve distinctly the tensile, flexural, and impact
strengths of the DGEBA/DEHP composites of about 34.2–43.4,
35.6–48.1, and 117.9–137.8%, respectively. With the
increase of the DEHP molecular weight, the mechanical performance
of the DEHP/DGEBA composites increased first and then decreased. The
DEHP-2/DGEBA composites have a better performance than that of the
DEHP-1/DGEBA and DEHP-3/DGEBA composites. It is important that the
DEHP can promote the degradation ability of the composites. The cured
DGEBA/DEHP-n composites containing 12 wt % DEHP-n can be degraded completely in only about 2 h at about
90 °C; however, the degradation degree of cured DGEBA is only
35% under the same degradation conditions, suggesting the good degradation
and recycling properties of the DEHP.

Experimental Section
Materials
Citric acid (CA), maleic anhydride (MA),
toluene, 1,4-dioxane, p-toluenesulfonic acid, epichlorohydrin
(ECH), ethyl acetate (EtOAc), NaOH, Na2SO4,
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) were commercially supplied
by Shanghai Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All reagents were of analytical
grade. The diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A (DGEBA) containing 5.1
mmol epoxy group per gram of resin was purchased from Yueyang Baling
Petrochemical Co., Ltd. DETA–AN, as a curing agent, was prepared
by an addition reaction between acrylonitrile (AN) and diethylene
triamine (DETA)32 at equal molar ratio.

Synthesis of DCHP
DCHP was synthesized by an esterification
reaction between CA and MA according to Scheme 3. The typical process for the synthesis of
DCHP-1 carrying 6 mol carboxyl groups was followed. CA (15.37 g, 0.08
mol), MA (3.92 g, 0.04 mol), toluene (30 mL), 1,4-dioxane (20 mL),
and p-toluenesulfonic acid (0.20 g) were added into
a three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer,
cooler, nitrogen inlet, and water trap. The reaction was carried out
for 6 h at 100 °C and then for 5 h at 125 °C. After 1,4-dioxane
was removed under reduced pressure, 16.9 g of a light yellow solid
with a yield of 91% was obtained, which proved to be a DCHP (DCHP-1).
DCHP-2 with a yield of 92% and DCHP-3 with a yield of 92% were synthesized
by a similar process as that for DCHP-1 using the molar ratios between
CA and MA of 8:1 and 26:1, respectively.

Scheme 3 Synthetic Scheme
of DEHP and Chemical Structure of DEHP-2
Synthesis of DEHP
DEHP was synthesized by a two-step
method39 according to Scheme 3. The typical process for the
synthesis of DEHP-1 was followed. First, DCHP-1 (3.75 g) and ECH (33.31
g) were taken in a three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with
a mechanical stirrer, cooler, and thermometer. The temperature was
raised to 115–120 °C, and the mixture was stirred for
3 h. The excess ECH was removed under a pressure of 3–5 mm
Hg at 120 °C. After the compound cooled to ambient temperature,
50 mL of EtOAc was introduced to dissolve it completely. Then, 18.0
g of NaOH was added into the flask and the reaction was allowed to
continue for 5 h. After the mixture was washed by 50 mL of water once
and 10 mL of water three times, 5.0 g of Na2SO4 was added to remove water. The remaining solvent was removed under
a pressure of 3–5 mm Hg at 90 °C. A yellowish-brown low-viscosity
transparent liquid (2.32 g) with a yield of 43% was obtained, which
was proved to be DEHP-1. Both DEHP-2 with a yield of 45% and DEHP-3
with a yield of 40% were synthesized by a similar process as that
for DEHP-1.

Preparation of DEHP/DGEBA Composites
The DEHP/DGEBA
blends containing 0–15 wt % DEHP were prepared by mixing DEHP
with DGEBA in a glass cup at 25 °C. A stoichiometric amount of
DETA–AN was added into the cup and stirred for 5 min. After
the bubbles in the DEHP/DGEBA blend were removed under vacuum for
10 min, the blend was put into a silicone rubber mold and cured at
25 °C for 12 h and then at 80 °C for 4 h. After that, the
samples were cooled gradually to room temperature and stored for about
12 h. The mechanical performances of the product were then assessed
using standard methods.

Degradation of Cured DEHP/DGEBA Composites
The cured
DEHP/DGEBA composite films with DEHP contents between 3 and 15 wt
% were prepared by a similar process as described in the above section.
The pure cured DGEBA film was obtained and used as comparison. These
films (0.5 g) were cut into small pieces of about 1 mm × 2 mm
× 2 mm and put into a 100 mL stainless hermetic autoclave with
7.5 g of H2O2 and 7.5 g of DMF, respectively.
The autoclave was heated to 90 °C and maintained for 2 h and
then cooled to room temperature. After this process, the remaining
solid was filtered out and washed with water several times and then
dried in vacuum at 80 °C for 3 h. The degradation degree (Dd) of the composites was calculated using eq 7 7  where W0 is the
mass of composites before degradation and W is the
mass of solid residues after degradation.

The degradation liquid
was extracted by EtOAc and H2O for GC–MS analysis.

Characterization
FT-IR studies were performed using
a Nicolet Nexus 470 FT-IR spectrometer. 1H NMR measurements
were conducted using a Bruker Avance III-400 NMR spectrometer with
tetramethylsilane as an internal standard and D2O and DMSO-d6 as solvents.

The measurements of impact
strength were conducted on a GOTECH GT-7045-MDL impact tester according
to GB/T 2567-2008. The tensile and flexural strengths were measured
on a GOTECH AI-700M universal materials tester according to the same
standard method.

Tg measurements
were carried out using
a NETZSCH TG209F3 system. Samples weighing 5–10 mg were heated
from 40 to 600 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate
of 10 °C/min. DSC study was carried out using a NETZSCH DSC200F3
instrument in a nitrogen atmosphere. The samples were first heated
to 200 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min to remove thermal history,
then cooled to room temperature, and finally re-heated to 150 °C
at a rate of 10 °C/min. The glass-transition temperature (Tg) was obtained from the second heating scan.

The morphology of the fractured surface was examined on a SEM (SU8010,
Hitachi). A thin section of the fractured surface was cut and sputter-coated
with gold prior to fractographic examination. SEM micrographs were
obtained under conventional secondary electron imaging conditions,
with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV.

Dynamic mechanical thermal
analysis was performed on cured samples
(30 mm × 10 mm × 4 mm) using a Q800 dynamic mechanical analyzer
(TA Instruments) in the temperature range from 298 to 473 K at the
rate of 10 K/min.
