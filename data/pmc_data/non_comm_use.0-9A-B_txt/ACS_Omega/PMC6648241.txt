Proteins
possess various domains and subdomain pockets with varying
hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity. The local polarities of these domains
play a major role in oxidation–reduction-based biological processes.
Herein, we have synthesized ultrasmall fluorescent copper nanoclusters
(Cu NCs) that are directed to bind to the different domain-specific
pockets of the model protein bovine serum albumins (BSA). Potential
electron acceptors, methyl viologen (MV) derivatives, were chosen
such that they specifically reach the various domains following their
hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity. Here, we have used MV2+,
HMV+, and DHMV2+, possessing hydrophilic, intermediate,
and hydrophobic specificities. Being electron acceptors, these derivatives
draw electrons from the Cu NCs through photoinduced electron transfer
(PET). The rate of PET varies at the different domains of BSA based
on the local environment which has been analyzed. Here, PET is confirmed
by steady state as well as time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy.
This study would provide a measurable way to identify the location
of the different domains of a protein which is scalable by changing
the superficial conditions without unfolding the protein.

Introduction
The hierarchical structure
of proteins is constructed by the steric
constraints generated on arrangements of the amino acids. The chiral
nature and the hydrogen bonding properties of the backbone create
the secondary structure of proteins that generally contains repetition
of α-helices and β-sheets known as “motifs”.1 Assembly of protein motifs into larger subunits
of structures, called “domains”, is often defined as
a unit of conserved sequence.2 There can
be structural and sequential similarity between proteins, such as
human and bovine serum albumins (HSA and BSA). Hence, classification
and comparison of a new protein structure can be done through identification
and partitioning of multiple domains in a protein structure. In the
two examples of proteins cited above, BSA is one of the most studied
serum albumin because of its structural similarity to HSA and high
water solubility. BSA consists of 583 amino acid residues comprised
of three homologous helical domains [I(1–195), II(196–383)
and III(384–583)] each having two subdomains. Seventeen disulfide
bridges divide the homologous domains into nine loops to provide rigidity
to the structure of BSA.3 α-helices
predominate the BSA structure with no β-sheet. Site II of BSA
is similar to HSA although Leu-237 residue occupies site I of BSA
which is hollow for HSA.3,4 Thus the Leu-237 residue
in site I of BSA prevents the insertion of hydrophobic molecules.

The serum albumins bind exceptionally well with many endogenous
and exogenous compounds,5 support distribution
of ligands, and protect them from being metabolized.6 In addition to the various ways of serum albumin binding,
their conformational dynamics toward diverse stimuli are studied as
they control efficient delivery of drugs and provide knowledge on
molecular level protein functions.7−11 BSA, a typical serum albumin, binds to plenty of guests and provides
information on the protein structure under various external conditions.
Cooperative binding of different dyes with BSA and HSA provides important
information on site-selective binding.12−15 Choice of suitable functional
groups for the interacting guest helps to detect active sites of the
proteins through noncovalent bonding.16 Electrostatic interaction of BSA and charged species can be investigated
using ionic fluorescent probes that emit upon aggregation.17 It has also been shown that hydrogen bonding
plays a vital role in binding amphiphiles to BSA.18

From the above cited examples, it becomes clear that
hydrophobic
interaction preludes binding of different species to BSA at site I
(cavity size of 2.53 Å) of subdomain II and binding at site II
(cavity size 2.6) involves hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding and electrostatic
interactions.19,20 Molecular docking helps in identifying
the potential binding pockets within the protein structure. A number
of binding pockets of various sizes are present in the structure of
BSA.21 The challenge to find the specific
characteristic of the protein pockets of various hydroaffinities seems
to have remained partly explored.21,22 Interaction
of copper nanocluster (Cu NC) probes
with serum albumins have been reported on the formation of protein
corona over the Cu NCs23,24 and creating energy transfer
antenna using HSA or l-cysteine (Cys)-protected Cu NCs.25,26 A previous study on interaction of Cu NCs with BSA showed minor
loss in the secondary structure.27 However,
there is hardly any report on recognition of protein pockets by electron-transfer
mechanism. Hence, the model protein, BSA, has been chosen to establish
this methodology using biocompatible luminescent Cu NC as probe.

To explore the different hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and mixed zones
of BSA quantitatively, we have synthesized Cys-protected luminescent
Cu NCs containing 9 Cu atoms and used photoinduced electron transfer
(PET) between the Cu NCs and various methyl viologen (MV) derivatives
which are well-known electron acceptors.28−30 Because there
were several reports on protein-protected Au and Ag NCs and hence
from the knowledge of biocompatibility, we have chosen Cu NCs for
the present study.31−34 Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy show that
the Cu NCs bind to the various BSA pockets which results into different
extents of PET with the MV derivatives. The fluorescence intensities
and change in the excited-state lifetime of the Cu NCs provide a quantitative
idea about the different domain-specific pockets in BSA. Although
the pockets in the protein are smaller than the Cu NCs used but intrusion
of the NCs did not destroy the secondary protein structure to a great
extent as evidenced by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy (see Supporting Information, Figure S8).

Experimental
Section
Materials
Copper nitrate trihydrate [Cu(NO3)2·3H2O], l-cysteine (C3H7NO2S), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), BSA, 1,1′-diheptyl-4,4′-bipyridinium
dibromide (DHMV2+), 1-heptyl-4-(4-pyridyl) pyridinium bromide
(HMV+), and methyl viologen (MV2+) were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich. Solutions were prepared using high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) water. Dialysis tube of molecular cutoff
<2 kDa was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All chemicals were of
highest purity grade and were used without further purification.

Synthesis of l-Cysteine-Capped Copper NCs
Fluorescent
Cu NCs were synthesized following an earlier reported
protocol with some modifications.26 In
brief, 0.2 mL of 100 mM Cu(NO3)2·3H2O solution was diluted with 19 mL of HPLC water in a round-bottom
flask under vigorous stirring. The mixture turned faint green immediately
on adding 4.8 mg of l-cysteine thereafter under nitrogen
atmosphere. The Cu2+–Cys complex forms on stirring
continuously for 5 min. The pH was adjusted to 12 by injecting requisite
amount of 3 (M) NaOH solution. Formation of Cu NC completes in 5 h
on stirring at room temperature. A dialysis tube of molecular cutoff
<2 kDa was used to purify the Cu NCs and stored at 4 °C for
further analysis. The synthesis protocol of fluorescent Cu NCs is
given in Scheme 1.

Instrumentation and Methods
Transmission
Electron Microscopy and Electron Dispersive Spectroscopy
Analysis
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were
recorded with a JEOL, JEM-2100F microscope using a 200 kV electron
source at the DST-FIST facility in IISER Kolkata. An aqueous solution
of Cu NCs was drop-casted on a carbon-coated copper grid and dried
in air. Electron-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was performed using
a JEM-2100F field emission gun electron microscope equipped with EDS,
diffraction pattern software, and high angle annular dark-field scanning
TEM detector.

Zeta Potential Measurement
The ξ-potential
measurements
were performed in a nanoparticle analyzer SZ-100 from Horiba Scientific
using He–Ne laser beam at 633 nm. An aqueous solution of Cu
NCs was used for this experiment.

Fourier Transform Infrared
Spectroscopy
IR spectra
were recorded on a Bruker (model ALPHA) FT-IR spectrometer. A KBr
pellet was made by mixing requisite amount of sample with KBr.

Dynamic
Light Scattering Measurement
A Malvern Zetasizer
Nano equipped with a 4.0 mW HeNe laser operating at λ = 633
nm was used for the dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements at
a scattering angle of 173°. Nonnegative least-square analysis
was used to calculate the size distribution.

Steady-State Spectroscopy
The absorption and steady-state
fluorescence spectral measurements were carried out using a Hitachi
U-2900 spectrophotometer and a QM 40 spectrofluorimeter from PTI Inc.,
respectively. Comparing the wavelength-integrated intensity of the
Cu NCs with the standard (quinine sulphate; QY = 0.54) yielded the
fluorescence quantum yield. The concentration-related artifacts were
avoided by using solutions having absorbance (OD) less than 0.05.
The excitation wavelength was 360 nm. Quantum yield was calculated
using the following equation 1  where Q, OD, I, and n stand for quantum yield, absorbance, integrated
luminescence intensity, and refractive index of the solvents, respectively.
Subscript R stands for reference (standard dye).

Time-Resolved
Measurement
A 375 nm diode laser excitation
source (with a temporal resolution of 70 ps) was used in the time-resolved
fluorescence experiments which were performed using a Horiba Jobin
Yvon Fluorocube instrument. The experimental method adopted was time-correlated
single photon counting (TCSPC). The fluorescence decay data were fitted
with a proper exponential decay equation. The nonlinear least square
iterative reconvolution procedure was done using IBH DAS6 (Version
2.2). The χ2 values assessed the quality of the fit.
PL decay traces have been observed to be multiexponential in nature
and could be successfully fitted with a biexponential or sometimes
with a triexponential function 2  where I(0) and I(t) are the PL intensities at time 0 and t, respectively. Average lifetime value, ⟨τ⟩,
can be calculated from the fitted data using the following equation 3  where τi is the excited-state lifetime
of each component of PL decay and Ai is the relative amplitude
of that very component.

Steady-State Fluorescence Anisotropy Measurement
Steady-state
fluorescence anisotropy measurements were done in a QM-40 spectrofluorimeter
from PTI using excitation and emission polarizers. The value of anisotropy
(r) was calculated using the following equation 4  where G is
the correction factor for the detector sensitivity to the polarization
direction of the emission and I∥ and I⊥ are the fluorescence decays
polarized parallel and perpendicular to the polarization of the excitation
light, respectively.

Rotational Anisotropy Measurement
Time-resolved rotational
anisotropy data were collected via the same TCSPC setup using excitation
and emission polarizers. Time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy, r(t), was calculated using the following
equation 5  where G is the correction
factor for the detector sensitivity to the polarization direction
of the emission and I∥(t) and I⊥(t) are the fluorescence decays polarized parallel and perpendicular
to the polarization of the excitation light, respectively. Rotational
correlation time (τrot) was extracted by fitting
the time-resolved anisotropy decay using a suitable exponential decay
equation.

Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy
The CD spectra were
measured in a JASCO J-815 spectrometer using a quartz cuvette with
1 mm pathlength in the wavelength range 200–400 nm. A scan
speed 100 nm/min was used to get the CD profiles.

Results and Discussion
The Cys-protected Cu NCs were synthesized following a reported
protocol with slight modification as shown in Scheme 1.26 The Cu2+–Cys complex was formed on the addition of Cys to
copper nitrate solution.35,36 At basic pH (pH ≈
12), deprotonation of the thiol group in Cys takes place, facilitating
the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) and Cu(0) without any externally
added reducing agent. At high pH, Cys can perform the dual role of
reducing agent and surface protecting ligand. Detail of the synthetic
method is provided in the Supporting Information. The synthesized Cu NCs were characterized microscopically as well
as spectroscopically (Figure 1). From the TEM data, we found that the Cu NCs were spherical
in shape with an average diameter of 1.94 ± 0.12 nm and well
dispersed without any aggregation (Figure 1A,B). The mass of the Cu NCs was calculated
using electrospary ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) measurement
(Figure 1C), where
a peak at m/z 857.87 appeared corresponding
to [Cu9L2 + 2Na+ + H+].
Using the spherical jellium model, we determined the number of Cu
atoms in the NCs from the spectral data. The model is applicable to
small metal NCs and is mathematically represented as37,38 6  where ΔEemission is the energy of emission from the
fluorescing NCs, EFermi is the Fermi energy,
and N represents
the number of metal atoms in NCs. Calculations (see Supporting Information, Section 3) show that the cyan-emitting
Cu NCs contain nine Cu atoms in agreement with the ESI-MS measurement.

magnified image of the Cu NCs and (C) ESI-MS spectroscopy.

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy
provided the surface
functionalities of the Cu NCs (Figure S1A). The thiol groups of Cys protect the metal atoms through covalent
bond formation. The FTIR spectrum of pure Cys shows a small peak at
2580 cm–1 because of the S–H stretching.
This peak completely disappears on formation of the Cu NCs, confirming
the formation of Cu–S covalent bonds. On the other hand, −NH2 stretching produces a broad peak in the range 3000–3800
cm–1. Additionally, broad peaks in the range of
1300–1660 cm–1 indicate the presence of −COOH
groups. These peaks remained unaltered in the spectrum for Cys–Cu
NCs, indicating the existence of the −NH2 and −COOH
groups in NCs as well. Hence, the FTIR study confirmed that the Cu
atoms in the Cu NCs were capped by the thiol moieties from Cys ligands.
An apparent zeta potential value of −58.6 mV indicated negative
surface charge of the Cys–Cu NCs (Figure S1B). This highly negative surface charge value is due to the
presence of the terminal carboxylate ions of Cys. In alkaline medium,
the Na+ ions from NaOH pair up with the carboxylate groups
through electrostatic interaction, providing greater solubility to
the Cys–Cu NCs in aqueous medium. DLS measurement showed the
average hydrodynamic diameter of the Cys–Cu NCs as ∼7.5
nm in an aqueous medium (Figure S1C).

The absorption spectrum was typically featureless as that for noble
metal NCs besides a broad hump around ∼362 nm (inset of Figure 2A).39 The absence of any peak around 500–600 nm confirms
the absence of surface plasmon resonance and hence Cu nanoparticles
(Cu NPs) and formation of Cu NCs (Figure 2A).40 Additionally,
the excitation spectrum of Cu NCs is consistent with an absorption
spectrum. Upon exciting at 370 nm, Cu NCs give intense cyan color
with emission maximum at 485 nm. The excitation wavelength-independent
photoluminescence (PL) emission maxima (Figure 2B) indicate the discreteness and specificity,
ensuring the monodispersity and molecule-like behavior of the Cu NCs.
The fluorescence quantum yield of the synthesized Cu NCs is calculated
using quinine sulphate (Φ = 0.54) in 0.1 M H2SO4 as standard. The obtained quantum yield is 0.078 for the
Cys–Cu NCs.

Figure 2 Optical characterization of the Cys–Cu NCs: (A)
absorption,
excitation, and emission spectrum (inset: zoomed image of the absorption
spectrum in the range 300–450 nm to show the shoulder at 362
nm indicated by the black arrow); (B) excitation of the sample at
different wavelengths showed that the Cu NCs are monodispersed in
solution phase. The experiments were performed at 24 °C.

The synthesized Cys–Cu
NCs were used as reporter fluorophores
for the various pockets of BSA and the signal of PET between the MV
derivatives and the NCs was used to quantify the behavior of the NCs
in the protein pockets. We chose three types of MV derivatives, viz.,
1,1′-diheptyl-4,4′-bipyridinium dibromide (DHMV2+), 1-heptyl-4-(4-pyridyl) pyridinium bromide (HMV+), and the parent methyl viologen (MV2+), for this purpose
(Figure 3). As mentioned
earlier that the different subdomains of BSA have sites that bind
specifically to either hydrophobic or hydrophilic guests and also
to sites which have mixed characteristics,19,20 we chose DHMV2+, HMV+, and MV2+ for binding to the hydrophobic, mixed, and hydrophilic pockets,
respectively. PET from metal NCs to MVs is well known, and plenty
of works are reported in this area.28−30 The three derivatives
exhibit difference in the extent of electron acceptance from a common
donor because of the presence of the attached hydrophobic chains and
hence variation in the electron deficiency at the acceptance center.
The initial PET experiments with the Cu NCs and the MV derivatives
were performed to estimate their respective PET capacity so that it
can be compared with those obtained in the presence of BSA.

Figure 3 MV and its
derivatives used in the present experiment.

The absorption spectrum of Cu NC (0.1 mM) did not show much
change
(Figure S2) on addition of the MV derivatives.
However, MV2+ and its derivatives quench the fluorescence
from the Cu NCs to different degrees (Figure 4A–C) presumably because of PET from
the Cu NCs to the MV derivatives. This quenching is supposed to be
dynamic, which was also confirmed from the respective Stern–Volmer
plot (Figure 4D). The
extent of fluorescence quenching is determined following the Stern–Volmer
equation 7  where F0 and F are the fluorescence intensities without and with the
quencher, KSV is the Stern–Volmer
constant, and [Q] is the concentration of quencher. A straight line
plot indicates one specific type of quenching (either static or dynamic).
Considering the corresponding excited-state lifetime, the Stern–Volmer
equation can also be expressed as 8  and 9  where τ0 and τ are
the excited-state lifetimes of the fluorophore in the absence and
presence of a quencher and kq is the rate
constant for the quenching process.

Figure 4 Quenching of fluorescence from the Cu
NCs by (A) DHMV2+, (B) HMV+, and (C) MV2+. The samples were
excited at 370 nm. The Stern–Volmer plots are assimilated in
(D) for the three quenchers.

Time-resolved fluorescence decay shows that progressive change
in the lifetime of the Cu NCs on adding the MV derivatives and linear
fit to τ0/τ against quencher concentration
with positive slope confirms dynamic quenching (Figure 5A–D, and Table 1). The decays take double-exponential fits
in compliance to Maity et al.26 The two
components arise because of the intrinsic electronic relaxation processes
in the singlet excited states of the Cu NCs. The slowest component
with highest contribution is due to the S1 to S0 relaxation. On addition of the MV derivatives, which are well-known
electron scavengers, we found noticeable decrease in the excited-state
lifetimes. The average lifetime decreases on addition of the quenchers
in each case. The characteristic changes for DHMV2+ and
MV2+ are close but that for HMV+ is the lowest.
The MV derivatives show variation in the extent of quenching of Cu
NC fluorescence owing to their chemical structures. As they are known
to be good electron acceptors, thus the dynamic quenching of Cu NC
fluorescence is considered to be due to PET. Probability of energy
transfer can be excluded, as there is no overlap between the emission
spectrum of the donor with the absorption spectrum of the acceptor.
While DHMV2+ and HMV+ have double and single
hydrocarbon flank/s, respectively, MV2+ does not contain
any hydrophobic moiety. Thus, MV2+ is the most hydrophilic
species and DHMV2+ is the least. HMV+ possesses
an intermediate character. These electron acceptors were chosen to
identify the different environments of the various domain-specific
pockets of BSA using PET. The different extents of quenching of Cu
NC fluorescence by the MV derivatives are calculated from the τ0/τ plot and are represented in Table 2. DHMV2+ shows highest quenching,
and HMV+ exhibits the lowest, that is, quenching rate constant
(kq) also follows this order. The structures
of the MV derivatives suggest least electron deficiency on HMV+, as it carries one positive nitrogen center and hence least
PET in this case is justified. Among DHMV2+ and MV2+, the inductive effect of the two methyl groups in the latter
makes it less electron deficient compared with DHMV2+ which
is reflected in the quenching rate.

The Cu NCs were found to readily interact with BSA.
Unlike D. K.
Sahu and K. Sahu, who synthesized 14-atom Cu NCs and studied their
interaction with BSA inferring 1:1 binding,27 and Das et al., who reported adsorption of HSA on glutathione-protected
Cu NCs,24 we could identify the protein
pockets. Moreover, 1:1 and 1:2 host–guest binding in BSA can
be well-understood from Benesi–Hildebrand double reciprocal
plots.41,42 On contrary to the reported protein–Cu
NC studies, besides mere guest–host binding, we intended to
look into the characteristics of the domain specific pockets in BSA.
Hence, we synthesized the Cys-protected ultrasmall fluorescent Cu
NCs intending their attachment to the various protein pockets so that,
by sending environment specific electron withdrawing probes (the MV
derivatives), the extents of PET can be monitored to obtain a quantitative
idea on the impact of the protein pockets on the Cu NCs due to the
specific environments.

The absorption spectra obtained due to
interaction between the
Cu NCs and BSA did not show much change at higher wavelengths. Absorbance
at 278 nm due to BSA increases on increasing the protein concentration
(Figure S3). We excited the Cu NCs bound
to BSA to avoid any data contamination due to energy transfer between
the tryptophan residues of BSA and the Cu NCs. On addition of BSA
to the Cu NCs, there is a slight increase in the Cu NC emission with
a little blue shift, indicating protein–Cu NC interaction (Figure S4). The steady-state anisotropy (r) of Cu NC increased on interacting with BSA (Figure S5) and the rotational freedom decreased
as obtained from the time-resolved anisotropy decay measurements (Figure S6). The value of τrot increased from 0.12 to 0.28 ns with the increase in BSA concentration,
confirming attachment of Cu NCs with BSA. From the Benesi–Hildebrand
double reciprocal plots, we observed that the Cu NCs bind to BSA neither
in 1:1 nor 1:2 ways as the fits deviate from linearity in both cases
(Figure S7). The results indicate attachment
of multiple Cu NCs to BSA, conforming with the proposed binding to
multiple protein pockets. This result is contrary to that reported
by Sahu et al.27 However, the attachment of the Cu NCs does not change the
secondary structure of BSA appreciably as can be seen from the CD
spectra (Figure S8). Moreover, the results
indicate that binding of the Cu NCs is not restricted only to the
surface hydrophilic pockets of BSA but also extends to the inner moderate
and less hydrophilic ones.

The emission peak of the Cu NCs shows
about 10 nm blue shift on
addition of BSA due to the change in polarity of the environment around
the NCs (Figure 6).
This indicates possible encapsulation of a portion of the Cu NCs to
enter the hydrophobic zones of BSA. Fluorescence of the Cu NCs bound
in the BSA pockets is quenched by the MV derivatives as they reach
specifically to the destinations based on their hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity
(Figure 6A–C).
The Stern–Volmer plot shows straight line fits for each of
the three cases, indicating one specific type of quenching (dynamic
quenching as per the above discussion) (Figure 6D). Comparison of the quenching trends in
BSA with those in bulk water shows lesser PET in the trapped state.
Because the MV derivatives shall reach the destination BSA pockets
specifically depending on the hydro-availability, the quenching parameters
need to be compared for each of the quenchers.

DHMV2+, (B) HMV+, and (C) MV2+. The
samples were excited at 370 nm. The Stern–Volmer plots are
assimilated in (D) for the three quenchers.

The time-resolved studies show small change in the average
lifetime
of the Cu NCs on interaction with BSA (Figure 7A–C and Table 3). A third ultrafast component (τ1) evolved on addition of BSA to the Cu NCs because of binding
of the Cu NCs to BSA. The system now consists of free and protein-bound
Cu NCs in equilibrium. The mean lifetime of Cu NC in BSA also quenches
as observed in blank and in the same order. The plot of τ0/τ against the quencher concentration gives a straight
line fit with a positive slope, indicating perseverance of dynamic
quenching as PET is expected during the interactions (Figure 7D). From the plot of τ0/τ, we calculated the quenching parameters for the BSA-attached
Cu NCs due to the MV derivatives which are provided in Table 4.

Comparing the data in Tables 2 and 4 and from the KSV and kq values,
we could calculate the change in the extent of PET from the Cu NCs
in free and bound states. Considering the solvation characteristics
of DHMV2+, HMV+, and MV2+, we assume
that these ions move specifically to the most, intermediate, and least
hydrophobic pockets of BSA that is already containing Cu NCs. On reaching
the Cu NCs, the MV derivatives undergo PET and the rate of increase
or decrease in the phenomenon provides us information on the effect
of the environment on the Cu NCs and hence the BSA pockets. These
information are important, as they would let us know how the specific
structure(s) of biological (protein) redox systems modulate rates
and specificities of physiological redox processes. Possibility of
protein designing to minimize these rapid rates to stop disastrous
biological “short circuits” might evolve by knowing
the changes.42

Cu NCs in the hydrophobic
pockets of BSA lead to 32% decrease in
PET compared with that in bulk water which accompanies 26% lowering
in the quenching rate. The changes are quite similar in hydrophilic
pockets where PET from Cu NC to MV2+ decreases by 35% and
the quenching rate lowers by 29%. The reduction in PET is much less
(20%) in the pockets with intermediate hydrophobicity (or hydrophilicity),
and the quenching rate lowers by 13%. The values indicate that the
rate of oxidation–reduction in the protein pockets of different
hydrophobicity (or hydrophilicity) depend much on the environment.

Conclusion
The results of interaction of minute fluorescent Cys-protected
Cu NCs with the site-specific MV derivatives in the protein pockets
having various polarities show that the quantitative measures of the
extent of local oxidation–reduction would allow one to modulate
the protein structure scaling to the right need. The Cu NCs used in
this study are not specific to surface binding and diffuse to all
the protein pockets. Site-specific electron acceptors were used in
the form of MV derivatives, and the phenomenon of PET could be used
to quantify the characteristics of the pockets. In the vast array
of studies on drug–protein and nanoparticle–protein
interactions, the local specification of the protein pockets were
left unknown. Our studies could provide a measurable way to understand
the characteristic of the different domain specific pockets of a protein
which is scalable by changing the superficial conditions without unfolding
the protein.
