Introduction
C2-Alkylated benzothiazoles
are widely present in pharmaceutical
compounds,1 agricultural chemicals,2 and organic functional materials.3 The incorporation of a hydroxyl group into the benzylic
position of benzothiazole derivatives has been applied to synthesize
various pharmaceuticals such as muscarinic antagonist,4 CaS receptor allosteric modulators,5 and antifungal agents6 (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Pharmaceuticals containing
a benzylic hydroxyl in benzothiazoles.

According to the literature studies, most of the traditional
routes
on synthesizing hydroxyalkylated benzothiazoles mainly focused on
addition of aldehydes or ketones including Li/Mg,7n-BuLi,8t-BuLi,9 and t-BuOLi10 catalyzed metalation of 2H-benzothiazoles as well as onium amide bases, t-Bu-P4,11 P5F,12 tetramethylammonium fluoride,13 catalyzed
deprotonation of 2H-benzothiazoles before addition
of aldehydes or ketones. In addition, the [Rh(COD)Binapine]BF4-catalyzed direct hydrogenation of 2-carbonyl benzothiazoles
was reported.14 Generally, the above routes
suffered from difficulty for the preparation of the starting materials,
harsh reaction conditions, complex procedures, and expensive organocatalysts
or transition-metal catalysts. Subsequently, photochemical methods
about oxidative cross-coupling of alcohols with different heteroarenes
were reported by Opatz15 (Scheme 1A) and Lei16 (Scheme 1B). Both methodologies were easy for preparing hydroxyalkylated heteroarenes
but suffered from long reaction times. On the other hand, the hydroxyalkylation
of heterocycles with alcohols under heating conditions was occasionally
reported. In 2011, Wang et al. reported the hydroxyalkylation of benzothiazoles
with alcohols in the presence of tert-butyl hydroperoxide
(TBHP) at 120 °C (Scheme 1C).17 In 2017, Kianmehr group published
hydroxyalkylation reactions of thiophenes and pyridines with alcohols
using ditert-butyl peroxide (DTBP) as the oxidant
at 130 °C (Scheme 1D).18 Next year, DTBP-mediated C2-hydroxyalkylation
reactions of chromones with alcohols at 140 °C were developed
by Yu et al (Scheme 1E).19 Despite the significant advances
of these reactions, they still suffered from certain limitations such
as relatively high reaction temperature, anhydrous reaction systems,
as well as the limited structural diversity of organic peroxides oxidants,
which are not easy to be removed in the post-treatment process and
can easily cause explosion in the industrial production. Accordingly,
we envisioned whether the use of inorganic oxidants would facilitate
the development of an advantageous strategy with mild conditions and
operational simplicity.20 In the light
of the reported reference,21 K2S2O8 could provide the sulfate radical anion
(SO4•–) under mild conditions,
which was regarded as a very strong one-electron oxidant with a redox
potential of 2.5–3.1 V. Along this line, we herein report a
mild and convenient direct hydroxyalkylation reaction of benzothiazoles
with a variety of alcohols by using K2S2O8 as the oxidant in H2O at 65 °C.

Scheme 1 Hydroxyalkylation
Reactions of Heterocycles with Alcohols
Results and Discussion
Initially, we examined this
hydroxyalkylation reaction using benzothiazole
(1a) as a model substrate and 2-propanol (2a) as a coupling partner. The results were outlined in Table 1. First, the reaction proceeded
by smoothly employing K2S2O8 (4 equiv)
as the oxidant in a mixture of alcohol and water at 45 °C. The
desired product 3ad was achieved in 35% yield within
6 h (Table 1, entry
1). Subsequently, different catalysts were then examined, such as
Na2S2O8, (NH4)2S2O8, DTBP, TBHP, tert-butyl
peroxybenzoate (TBPB), 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ),
and benzoyl peroxide (BPO) (Table 1, entries 2–8), but no further improvement of
the yield was obtained. Among them, those reactions without persulfates
did not give the desired product (Table 1, entries 4–8). Inspiringly, the product
yield increased to 85% when the reaction temperature increased to
65 °C (Table 1, entry 10). We further tested the amount of K2S2O8, but no improvement was observed (Table 1, entries 12–13). In
addition, the results showed that the product could be obtained in
comparable yields as the amount of solvents was reduced to 4 mL (2-propanol/H2O = 2 mL:2 mL) or the reaction time was shortened to 3 h (Table 1, entries 14–15).
Finally, the control experiments demonstrated that K2S2O8 and H2O were necessary for successful
coupling, while O2 had no effect on the reaction (Table 1, entries 16–18).
Notably, the procedure was applicable to 10 mmol scale (1.353 g),
and the product 3ad was isolated in 72% (1.390 g) yield
under the optimized reaction conditions (Scheme 2).

Having optimized the reaction conditions, we investigated
the scope
of the alcohols (2) in the direct hydroxyalkylation with
benzothiazole (1a) and the results are shown in Table 2. As expected, a series
of aliphatic alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, 2-propanol,
butanol, 2-methyl-1-propanol, 2-butanol, pentanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol,
and 2-pentanol, were all fine hydroxyalkyl sources, generating the
corresponding hydroxyalkylated benzothiazoles in moderate to good
yields (Table 2, 3aa–3aj). The results showed that along with the increase
of the carbon chain, the yields of the corresponding products decreased
gradually. It can also be seen that the yields of benzothiazoles with
secondary alcohols were generally higher than benzothiazoles with
primary alcohols containing the same number of carbon atoms (Table 2, 3ac, 3ae, and 3ah compared to 3ad, 3ag, and 3aj, respectively). In addition,
the direct alkylation of benzothiazole with cyclopentanol and ethylene
glycol also provided the corresponding products 3ak (71%)
and 3al (73%), respectively. Unfortunately, when allyl
alcohol, benzyl alcohol, or phenyl ethanol was used as the hydroxyalkyl
source, no desired cross-coupling products were observed (Table 2, 3am and 3an), which might be due to the combination of
the steric and electronic effects of the conjugated system. Interestingly,
while diethylene glycol was used as the hydroxyalkyl source, only 3ao was obtained in 56% yield (Table 2, 3ao), which revealed that
hydroxyl carbon was preferred to α-carbon of ether to construct
the C–C bond.

Table 2 Substrate Scope of
Alcoholsa
a Reaction conditions: benzothiazole
(1a, 0.5 mmol), alcohols (2, 2.0 mL), K2S2O8 (4.0 equiv), H2O (2.0
mL), 65 °C, and 3–6 h under aerobic condition.

To further demonstrate the applicability
of this reaction, we examined
the substrate scope of substituted benzothiazoles. As shown in Table 3, moderate to good
yields were obtained when different substituted benzothiazoles and
alcohols were utilized (Table 3, 3ba–3bj). It was noteworthy that the
yields of benzothiazoles with electron-donating groups were obviously
higher than benzothiazoles with electron-withdrawing groups. Benzothiazoles
with electron-donating groups (−OMe) gave the target products
in 75–88% yields (Table 3, 3ba, 3bc, 3be, 3bf, 3bh, and 3bj), while benzothiazoles
with electron-withdrawing groups (−Cl) offered the target products
in 55–63% yields (Table 3, 3bb, 3bd, 3bg, and 3bi) and 6-nitrobenzothiazole only gave the trace amount of
the product (Table 3, 3bk). In particular, the reactions of 6-methoxy-benzothiazole
and 7-methoxy-benzothiazole with 2-propanol produced the coupling
products in similar yields (Table 3, 3be and 3bf), which seemed
that the reactions were not sensitive to the steric hindrance caused
by benzene substitutions.

Table 3 Substrate Scope of
2H-Benzothiazolesa
a Reaction conditions: benzothiazoles
(1, 0.5 mmol), alcohols (2, 2.0 mL), K2S2O8 (4.0 equiv), H2O (2.0
mL), 65 °C, and 3–6 h under aerobic condition.

To explore the applicability of
the present hydroxyalkylation of
heteroarenes with ethers, we studied benzothiazole with tetrahydrofuran,
1,4-dioxane, 1,3-dioxolane, and ethylene glycol dimethyl ether. As
can be seen from Table 4, the alkylation products 5a–e were obtained
in satisfactory yields under the optimized conditions. Furthermore,
the reaction of benzimidazole with 1,4-dioxane also proceed smoothly.
Among them, the yield of 5d was 2.5 times that of 5d′, which shows a tendency to activate C–H
bonds with weaker bond dissociation energy. In addition, the reaction
of benzothiazole with ethylene glycol dimethyl ether afforded a regioisomeric
mixture with a ratio of 1.2/1.0 in favor of the external product in
85% combined yield (Table 4, 5e and 5e′). It may be
caused by the difference of the stability of the free-radical intermediate
and the steric hindrance of the α-position sp3 C–H
in ethylene glycol dimethyl ether.

Table 4 Further Applicationa
a Reaction conditions:
azole (1, 0.5 mmol), ethers (2, 2.0 mL),
K2S2O8 (4.0 equiv), H2O (2.0 mL),
65 °C, and 6 h under aerobic condition.

In order to provide some insights into the intermolecular
competition,
a series of experiments were carried out. The results demonstrated
that the electron density in the phenyl rings of benzothiazoles strongly
affected the reaction rate (Scheme 3A). Furthermore, compared to primary alcohols as the
hydroxyl source, the yields of benzothiazole with secondary alcohols
were obviously higher (Scheme 3B–D). For example, the reaction of benzothiazole with
a mixture of 2-propanol and propanol provided corresponding products
with a ratio of 2.1/1.0 in 68% combined yield (Scheme 3B), the reaction of benzothiazole with a
mixture of 2-butanol and butanol gave corresponding products with
a ratio of 3.6/1.0 in 46% combined yield (Scheme 3C), and the reaction with a mixture of 2-pentanol
and 3-methyl-1-butanol produced corresponding products with a ratio
of 3.0/1.0 in 44% combined yield (Scheme 3D). We speculated that primary alcohols could
be oxidized to aldehydes and the formed products could be further
oxidized to ketones in the presence of the oxidant,22 while the products with secondary alcohols could avoid
the latter situation. Thus, we concluded that the secondary alcohols
were more suitable for the reaction than primary alcohols.

Scheme 3 Intermolecular
Competition Experiments
As shown in Scheme 4, when 2.0 equiv of 3,5-ditert-butyl-4-hydroxytoluene
was added to the standard reaction, the product yield was significantly
reduced from 81 to 35%, which could indicate that this transformation
involved radical intermediates. More importantly, we observed the
adducts resulting from the sequestration of the a-hydroxyl radical
and 2-benzothiazole radical by BHT (Scheme 4, 6a and 6b), which
revealed that the reaction should proceed through a radical pathway.23

Scheme 4 Radical Trapping Experiment
According to the radical trapping experiment,
both hydroxyl radical
and benzothiazole radical were trapped by radical scavenger; therefore,
cross-coupling between the radicals would occur in the reaction. In
addition, benzothiazole would be attacked by other radicals,24 and thus, two plausible routes were speculated
in Scheme 5. First,
homolytic cleavage of K2S2O8 generated
sulfate radical anions (SO4•–),25 which abstracted hydrogens from benzothiazole 1a and 2-propanol 2d affording the benzothiazole
radical 1aa and hydroxyl radical 2da, respectively.18,19 Then, cross-coupling reaction took place between the two radicals
producing the desired product 3ad.17 On the other hand, hydroxyl radical 2da would
attack the 2-position of benzothiazole 1a to form radical
cation intermediates 1ab, which were deprotonated by
the SO4•– to give the products 3ad.24

Scheme 5 Proposed Mechanism
Conclusions
In
conclusion, we have developed an efficient K2S2O8-mediated hydroxyalkylation reaction of benzothiazoles
with alcohols in aqueous solution providing a range of hydroxyalkylated
benzothiazoles in moderate to good yields. In addition, benzimidazole
and ethers were also compatible in this reaction, leading to corresponding
C2 ether-substituted heteroarenes. This procedure took advantage of
the solubility of inorganic salts in water to lead to an easier and
safer post-treatment process. The reaction worked well in aqueous
condition and under a lower reaction temperature than before. Accordingly,
we believe that the protocol not only contributes to the realization
of “safer” and “milder” synthesis but
also offers opportunities for different approaches in chemical synthesis.

Section
General Information
All reagents were purchased from
commercial sources and used without further purification. All reactions
were monitored by thin-layer chromatography, which was performed on
precoated aluminum sheets of silica gel 60 (F254). The products were
purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel (200–300
mesh). Melting points were uncorrected. 1H NMR spectra
were recorded at 500 MHz in CDCl3 or DMSO-d6, and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 125
MHz in CDCl3 or DMSO-d6; copies
of their 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra are provided;
all chemical shifts are given in ppm. All new products were further
characterized by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) obtained
on a time-of-flight liquid chromatograph/mass spectrometer equipped
with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source.

General Procedure
To a 25 mL test tube, a mixture of
benzothiazoles 1 (0.5 mmol), alcohols (ethers) 2 (3) (2 mL), K2S2O8 (4.0
equiv, 2.0 mmol, 540 mg), and H2O (2.0 mL) was stirred
at 65 °C in open air. The reaction system was stirred for 3–6
h until the reaction was completed (monitored by TLC). The solvent
was then removed under vacuum, and the residue was extracted with
ethyl acetate (30 mL) and washed with saturated NaHCO3 solution.
The organic phase was then dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated in vacuum. The resulting residue
was purified by column chromatography on silica gel, eluting with
petroleum ether/ethyl acetate (1:1–10:1, v/v) to afford the
products 3 and 5.
