Measuring
thicknesses in thin films with high spatial and temporal
resolution is of prime importance for understanding the structure
and dynamics in thin films and membranes. In the present work, we
introduce fluorescence-interferometry, a method that combines standard
reflected light thin film interferometry with simultaneous fluorescence
measurements. We apply this method to the thinning dynamics and phase
separation in free-standing inverse phospholipid bilayer films. The
measurements were carried out using a standard fluorescence microscope
using multichannel imaging and yielded subnanometer resolution, which
is applied to optically measure the discrete thickness variations
across phase-separated membranes.

Introduction
The thickness of thin
films and bilayer structures is paramount
to understanding in many areas of technology and biology. For example,
evaluating membrane heterogeneity and thickness fluctuations in in
vitro model phospholipid bilayer systems can elucidate the fundamental
underpinnings of biophysical processes, such as signaling and trafficking.1 This is known as the “lipid raft”
hypothesis, where lipid micro- and nanodomains within the plane of
the bilayer membrane laterally sort and organize certain proteins
to orchestrate function. As a result, there has been extensive research
into the phase separation of multicomponent membranes to understand
the key forces and dynamic interactions at play. Specific questions
to address in these systems include the following: (1) What is a temperature−composition
phase diagram? (2) What are the relevant physical attributes, such
as line tension, thickness and thickness heterogeneity, fluidity,
and lipid molecular distribution, along this parameter space? (3)
How do these morphological relationships affect function in model
membranes and ultimately in in vivo systems? At the heart of these
questions is the requirement to both visualize the domains and characterize
their thicknesses; therefore, various techniques have been established
to evaluate these parameters and address these questions. However,
often a combination of techniques and experimental conditions is required
for a comprehensive characterization of bilayer membranes.

For
instance, fluorescence microscopy techniques have proven to
be an invaluable tool to investigate membrane heterogeneity, revealing
insights into lipid diffusion,2 lateral
phase separation,3 line tension,4 membrane protein activity5 and sorting,6 and small-molecule translocation.7 However, the nanometer-scale thickness and the
thickness variation between phase-separated domains make it difficult
to measure the thickness of the bilayers using fluorescence. The z-resolutions of confocal and super-resolution microscopies
are limited by the precision with which the point spread function
can be deconvoluted. For example, confocal fluorescence microscopy
could assess the degree of domain alignment between micron-thick multilamellar
membrane stacks, but to precisely evaluate thickness differences between
domains, complementary experiments using atomic force microscopy (AFM)
have been carried out.8 The increased spatial
resolution of AFM comes at the expense of time resolution, which is
sufficient for domain formation kinetics9−12 but too long for diffusion dynamics
or line tension fluctuations. Ellipsometry offers a noncontact method
to evaluate the phospholipid bilayer thickness with an improved temporal
resolution and a larger field of view than AFM,13 but currently both methods are limited to supported bilayers,
where extra precautions must be taken to ensure that the substrate
does not influence the results, as opposed to free-standing membranes.
Small-angle X-ray or neutron scattering techniques14−17 (SAXS or SANS) provide a fine
resolution of thickness variations in phase-separated phospholipid
vesicles, but this requires accurate modeling of the scattering signal
and gives an ensemble average of the properties without spatial resolution
of individual domains. As a result, despite the multitude of methods
addressing each problem individually, simultaneous measurements of
the lipid bilayer thickness and optical monitoring of dynamic processes
are not possible.

To measure the thickness of molecularly thin
layers optically,
interferometric methods are necessary. This is particularly challenging
for free-standing (as opposed to supported) thin films. Reflection
interference contrast microscopy (RICM) is a particularly useful tool
to measure the thickness of model membranes adsorbed or proximate
to a reflecting interface.18 Recently,
it has also been extended to detect nanometer-scale lipid phase separation
without the need for fluorescent labels.19 For fully free-standing thin films, reflected light thin film interferometry
is used and has the advantage of requiring simpler optical components.
The main operating principle involves the incidence of monochromatic
light orthogonally onto a planar micrometer- to nanometer-scale thickness
film. By measuring the reflected light intensity and considering the
values of the refractive index of the film and surroundings, the film
thickness is calculated. This technique has been successfully and
extensively applied to surfactant films studied in thin film balance
experiments. Notable experimental and theoretical advances have been
made, enabling new insights into the structure and dynamics of thin
liquid films. Experimentally, the original glass capillary (Sheludko
cell)20 and porous plate holders21,22 have been improved upon by either using microfluidic microfabrication23 or tapering the edges of a porous chip.24 These alternatives allow for symmetric drainage
in the central orifice and the ability to apply a wider range of capillary
pressures. A basic goal of these experiments is to link the interfacial
material properties with film stability by measuring the equilibrium
disjoining pressure versus film thickness isotherm or analyzing dynamic
thinning processes. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is commonly chosen
as a model system, where above the critical micelle concentration
(cmc), an oscillatory disjoining pressure is measured because of the
stepwise thinning based on the successive expulsion of micellar layers.23−27 Modeling of this phenomenon has determined the additive micelle
structure interaction component
of the disjoining pressure isotherm [in addition to the standard Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek
(DLVO) contributions],28 and dynamic experiments
and theory have linked the role of surface viscosity29 and surface viscoelasticity30,31 on film stability.
The versatility of this approach extends beyond ionic surfactants
to include nonionic surfactants,32−34 polyelectrolytes,35,36 and also nonadsorbing particle suspensions.37 In some cases, for a more accurate determination of the film thickness,
a three-layer model incorporating an independent measure of the refractive
index and the thickness of the adsorbed surfactant layer was applied.38,39 Despite the progress made in the realm of surfactants, thin film
balance experiments on aqueous dispersions of phospholipids40 and proteins41 are
much rarer because of experimental challenges in microchip fabrication
and pressure control; however, we have recently developed a system
to overcome these issues.42

In this
work, we address the need to simultaneously detect lipid
phase separation and quantify bilayer thickness with high spatial
and temporal resolutions in a noninvasive manner using a simple experimental
setup. The technique relies on a combination of fluorescence and interferometric
imaging using a solid-state light source and an upright microscope
to measure the nanoscale thickness of free-standing, planar, inverse
bilayer thin films. Inverse bilayer films, with phosphate headgroups
in the interior and hydrocarbon tails on the exterior, are the opposite
configuration of the bilayers composing cellular membranes. They contain
the same lateral repulsion between headgroups and van der Waals attraction
between the hydrocarbon tails, whereas they lack the tail interdigitation
and interactions at the bilayer midplane. Therefore, studying the
phase behavior and dynamics of inverse bilayers can offer insight
into the importance and magnitude of different interactions on the
overall interaction landscape that dictates cell membrane mechanics;
such analogies are commonly made in the phospholipid monolayer literature.43 Here, using only a standard fluorescence microscope,
we detect lipid phase separation and measure a thickness difference
of 0.35 nm between fluid and gel phases in binary 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC)/1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) inverse bilayers.

Methods
Materials
The phospholipids DOPC, DPPC, and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)
ammonium salt (DOPE-NBD) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. NaCl
(99.99%, metal basis) and NaHCO3 were obtained from Alfa
Aesar. CaCl2 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Ultrapure
water was used (Milli-Q, Merck-Millipore; resistivity, <18.2 MΩ
cm).

Sample Preparation
Lipid mixtures (DOPC/DPPC in a 3:2
molar ratio with 1 mol % fluorescent DOPE-NBD) in chloroform are
placed in a round-bottom flask and dried under a gentle stream of
nitrogen. Any residual chloroform is removed by placing the sample
under vacuum for at least 1 h. The lipids are resuspended in an aqueous
salt buffer (150 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, and 0.2 mM NaHCO3) at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. The sample is tip-sonicated
(Hielscher UP400S, 30% pulse and 75% amplitude) after the addition
of the buffer until the solution is clear. The lipid solutions are
used within a week of preparation.

Experimental Setup
We have recently developed a thin
film balance apparatus to create large-area planar phospholipid bilayers
with tension control.42 Here, we briefly
overview how our setup is used to investigate inverse bilayers in
air. The thin film balance is composed of a custom designed microfluidic
bikewheel chip (Micronit Microfluidics) with a 1 mm diameter orifice
at the center. Before use, the bikewheel microchips are made hydrophilic.
The chips are cleaned in a saturated solution of NaOH in ethanol in
an ultrasonication bath for 20 min before being thoroughly rinsed
with water. The chip is glued to a titanium holder using UHU two-component
epoxy and placed in a temperature-controlled pressure chamber. The
capillary pressure in the microchip is controlled by a differential
pressure transducer (Baratron 120AD) interfaced with a syringe pump
(Harvard Apparatus PHD Ultra CP).

The microchip is loaded with
a preheated lipid/buffer mixture before inserting it into the chamber
at the desired temperature (43 °C) and connecting the pressure
control tubing. A thick film of aqueous lipid solution is formed within
the bikewheel annulus and allowed to drain by increasing the capillary
pressure. A fast drainage rate is used to induce dimple formation
and to calibrate the reflected light intensity, whereas a slower controlled
drainage is used to encourage the formation of a single inverse phospholipid
bilayer film at the center of the orifice.

For observing inverse
bilayer formation and measuring lipid domain
appearance, the sample is imaged on an upright microscope (Nikon Eclipse
FN1) with a 10× long-working-distance objective and a Hamamatsu
ORCA-Flash4.0 CMOS camera. A multi-solid-state LED light source (Nikon
Spectra-X) is cycled between wavelengths λ = 508 and 470 nm.
A quad-band filterset (Nikon FRE17055) matches the spectral excitation
and emission of the fluorescent lipid, allowing for fluorescence microscopy
using λ = 470 nm, while also transmitting λ = 508 nm for
reflection imaging. Two important aspects of this setup are (1) the
use of a 16 bit camera, which is necessary to resolve the small changes
in intensity in both fluorescence and reflectance signals and (2)
high-speed triggering between the light source and the camera, which
enable multichannel imaging at a maximum frame rate of 100/N fps, where N is the number of channels
required.

Results and Discussion
For a thin
liquid film surrounded by two bulk phases of equal refractive
index (in our case, air), the reflected light intensity I from the incidence of monochromatic light orthogonal to the film
is related to the film thickness by 1  where Δ = (Ii – Imin)/(Imax – Imin) is the scaled intensity, λ is the wavelength of light, R = [(nf – nair)/(nf + nair)]2 is the Fresnel reflectance coefficient, nf and nair are the
refractive indices of the film and air, respectively, and i denotes different areas of the thin film.20 Crucial to accurate determination of the film thickness
is the determination of Imax and Imin, which are the maximum and minimum reflected
light intensities corresponding to the positive and negative reflected
light interference occurring at film thicknesses equal to integer
values of λ/4, and using an appropriate value for the thin film
refractive index. In thin film studies of surfactant films, Imax and Imin are
traditionally determined by rapidly draining the film and monitoring
the intensity at the fringes that appear.23,44 As the film drains through various orders of λ/4 nm thicknesses,
the repeated detection of maximum and minimum values of the reflected
light intensity gives confidence in the values of Imax and Imin used. A more
subtle increase in the disjoining pressure is then used to realize
stable films. The reflected light intensity from the stable thin films
that form when performing a disjoining pressure isotherm measurement
is between these two values, and the film thickness ranges from >100
to 10 nm. The film thickness measured using eq 1 is termed an “equivalent” thickness
because the bulk value of the solution refractive index is used for nf. This is justified because of the minimal
thickness of the adsorbed surfactant layers in comparison to the overall
film thickness. Corrections can also be made for a refractive index
difference between the bulk solution and the surfactant, which requires
an independent measure of the thickness and the refractive index of
the adsorbed surfactant layer.39,44,45 We discuss the ramifications of using different values for the film
refractive index in our results below.

We have found that the
resolution of reflective light interferometry
is insufficient for aqueous films of lipids because the final film
that forms is within the noise of Imin, often being slightly darker than any of the fringes that form during
rapid drainage (Figure 1). This prevents an accurate measurement of the thickness. Note that
in Figure 1, we have
increased the incident light intensity to emphasize the failure to
determine Imin, with the signal becoming
saturated where Imax would be found. Motivated
by this failure, we have developed a way to combine information from
fluorescence microscopy and the reflected light intensity signal in
order to accurately determine inverse bilayer lipid film thicknesses.
For a film region with uniform thickness, eq 1 has three unknowns: h, Imax, and Imin. In
essence, we use the information from the fluorescence signal to develop a series of equations relating the thickness of
different areas of the film to determine Imax and Imin using the reflected light intensity from those areas alone. This is particularly notable
in that we can now optically measure the subnanometer changes in bilayer
thicknesses that occur due to lipid phase separation.

during fast drainage of an aqueous phospholipid suspension to determine Imax and Imin using
the standard procedure. The profiles are offset by a constant value
(65 535), and the t = 1.5 s profile is replotted
for comparison with the final profile. A single inverse bilayer phospholipid
film forms over the course of 8 s, as shown in the images on the right.
The scale bar represents 100 μm.

One of the additional challenges
we have encountered while studying inverse lipid bilayers in a thin
film balance is the tendency for the lipids to form lamellar aggregates
in solution. However, this is used to our advantage in the current
method because the thicknesses of these multilayer stacks are quantized
by the molecular dimensions of the phospholipids. Figure 2 shows the thin film formed
after rapid drainage from a mixture of lipids (DOPC/DPPC in a 3:2
molar ratio with 1 mol % fluorescent DOPE-NBD at 43 °C) that
shows a series of lamellar aggregates. The fluorescence signal (Figure 2a) and the reflected
light intensity (Figure 2b,c) both exhibit the same pattern across the film. From this, it
is obvious that the different areas of fluorescence/reflected light
intensity have different film thicknesses. Furthermore, from the fluorescence,
we can infer relations between the different thicknesses based on
the fact that these thickness differences arise from a varying number
of lamellar layers. Table 1 gives the fluorescence intensity for the different areas
of the film indicated in Figure 2. We observe immediately that the fluorescence intensity
is quantized in logical increments assuming the darkest (thinnest)
layer, area 1, is a single bilayer. Note, in particular, the curvature
at the borders of area 2 highlighted in Figure 2c and the observation that all parts of area
2 have the same reflected light intensity. The border between areas
2a and 1 is continuous with that of area 3/area 2b, and finally the
area 2c/area 1 border. This indicates that areas 2a and 2c are part
of the same additional phospholipid layer on one side of the inverse
bilayer constituting area 1. The independent continuity of the border
between areas 2a and 3, 2b/1, and 2c/3 indicate that area 2b arises
from the same additional thickness, but occurring on the opposite
side of the single inverse bilayer in area 1. Lastly, where these
additional lamellar layers overlap, the reflected light intensity
increases as a result of the thicker film. This is illustrated schematically
in Figure 2d, and an
analogous observation can be made for layers 4a/b.

This
observation is quantitatively confirmed with the fluorescence
signal. We assume that area 1 is a single inverse bilayer based on
the fact that this layer is the darkest, on par with the darkest intensity
detected from the rapid drainage of the film, and we never observe
a thinner blacker film. Based on the hydrophilic phospholipid headgroups
and hydrophobic hydrocarbon tails, we assume that an “inverse”
bilayer with a morphology opposite to that of a traditional cell membrane
is formed. Area 2 has 1.5 times more fluorescence than area 1, implying
that area 2 is this single bilayer with an additional monolayer of
lipid (Table 1). Likewise,
the fluorescence of area 3 is double that of area 1, indicating two
inverse bilayers, which makes sense based on our observations above
about the overlap of the different regions. The quantization continues
through thicker layers, with the fluorescence from area 6 being approximately
4 times that of area 1 (four inverse bilayers). Even thicker lamellar
stacks can be observed in the fluorescence; however, eventually the
reflected light intensity saturates.

Returning to eq 1,
we now have several options to deduce a set of equations to solve
for Imax and Imin, and ultimately the film thickness. Equation 1 can be written independently for each region
of the film specified in Figure 2, but they share the same Imax and Imin values. Therefore, at minimum,
two independent equations relating three values of hi are needed to establish a solvable
set of five equations (three forms of eq 1 and two height relations) and five unknowns (three
thicknesses and intensity minima and maxima). One option, chosen for
simplicity in the subsequent calculations, relates the thickness of
area 3 with that of area 1, h3 = 2h1, and area 6 with that of area 3, h6 = 2h3.

Now, we are
in a position to solve for Imax and Imin. Substituting the expressions
for eq 1 to the height
relations, we have 2   3   4  where we have substituted
Ψi for the square root term for
compactness. Taking
the sine of both sides gives 5  which can be reduced using the double angle
rule to 6  and finally 7  Analogously for h6 = 2h3, we have 8  The only unknowns in eqs 7 and 8 are Imax and Imin because the unscaled
reflected light intensity for each region (Ii=1,3,6) is known and given in column 4 of Table 1. We solve this system
of equations numerically and find that Imax = 526 834 and Imin = 7945. Note
that to enhance the contrast between the reflected light intensity
of the different lamellar layers in the film we have increased the
incident light intensity, which causes the fitted value for Imax to be above the maximum possibly detected
by the 16-bit grayscale CMOS camera used.

Using the solved values
for Imax and Imin, we apply eq 1 to all
areas of the film to determine the film thickness
values reported in column 5 of Table 1. As expected, the values for the thinnest layers are
of sub-10 nanometer scale, with the thickness of a single inverse
bilayer being approximately 4 nm. This agrees well with the expected
thickness of a lipid bilayer deduced from scattering and AFM methods.14,15,46 The height ratios assumed from
the fluorescence intensity are carried over to the film thickness.
Importantly, no information from areas 2, 4, or 5 was used in this
derivation, yet the film thickness measured for these areas agrees
with the height ratios given in their respective fluorescence intensities.
To further check the success of this method, we derived another set
of equations relating the thicknesses, using h3 = 2h1, as before, and also h3 = 2h2 – h1. The latter relation is unique in that it
actually does not rely on the fluorescence signal because it can be
implied based on the continuity of the area borders as explained above.
The trigonometric details for this set of equations are provided in
the Supporting Information. In addition
to eq 7 (and instead
of eq 8), we now have 9  using h3 = 2h2 – h1. This
set can also be solved to give similar values of Imax and Imin, resulting in
thicknesses in great agreement with the values found earlier. In this
case, no information from area 4, 5, or 6 of the film was used in
this deduction, yet accurate thickness ratios were obtained.

In simplifying and solving the equations, we have assumed a uniform
film refractive index which is equal to that of DPPC in the liquid
expanded phase measured using ellipsometry, nf = 1.455.47,48 This is chosen because at the
expected thicknesses, the phospholipids are the main component of
the film and there are many measurements on DPPC as opposed to DOPC.
Although we do not know the tilt angle of the phospholipid chains
in the film, anisotropy in the refractive index is minimal. The values
for Imax and Imin do not change appreciably even if the refractive index of water
is used to solve eqs 7 and 8. We also evaluated the thickness based
on a different assumption: using the refractive index of the phosphate
headgroup/water interior as nf = 1.4013 to calculate the equivalent thickness and correcting
for the film thickness using the three-layer method.44,45 This presents an additional complication that an assumed value of
the phospholipid hydrocarbon layer thickness must be used, which we
do not know in situ and could vary from that measured by ellipsometry/reflectivity
using monolayers or bilayer vesicles because of variations in packing
and chain tilt. Nevertheless, using this approach and a varying hydrocarbon
layer of 1.1–1.4 nm thickness resulted in an overall film thickness
in the range of 3.73–3.64 nm, approximately 0.2 nm less than
that reported in Table 1. To minimize the number of assumptions necessary, we feel justified
in using a uniform value of the refractive index based on the phospholipids,
but potentially, simultaneous determination of other parameters could
improve the accuracy. Additional sources of variability in the measurement
include the bandwidth of the incident light (17 nm), noise in the
camera detection, and intrinsic thickness fluctuations in the bilayer.
These factors combine to cause the greatest error in measurement at
the smallest film thicknesses. Considering the bandwidth of the incident
light, the uncertainty in the actual film thickness is 1.7% of its
magnitude, which corresponds to ±0.07 nm for the single inverse
bilayer. Camera noise is practically negligible; using the same exposure,
the dark counts of the camera have an average intensity of 102 ±
4. These optics are already excellent for measuring the inverse bilayer
film thickness and phase separation, as explained below; however,
performing the measurement with a longer-wavelength incident light
source and narrowing its bandwidth are strategies to increase measurement
precision.

With values for Imax and Imin in hand, the two- or three-dimensional film
thickness
can now be determined accurately. To illustrate this, Figure 3a shows the reflected light
intensity of a thin film formed from the same lipid mixture with smaller
lamellar areas in the top right of the film. A linescan across this
area reveals the sharp steps in the film thicknesses, which span from
a single inverse lipid bilayer 3.9 nm thick to four stacked inverse
bilayers 15.6 nm thick (Figure 3b). Note that in our schematic, we cannot assess the geometry
of the regions that contain half of a bilayer (an additional monolayer)
or how the edges are stabilized. We do note that the lamellar areas
do not form from stepwise thinning of micelles, as in typical surfactant
films above the cmc such as SDS,23−27 but rather are stable layers that move around the
film as it expands or contracts. This feature is detrimental to performing
disjoining pressure isotherm measurements because the boundary conditions
of the film are not symmetric, but it does of course enable us to
determine the film thickness and potentially investigate the ramifications
of different solutions or lipid conditions on the morphology of such
multilayer stacks. The portions of the film with an odd number of
lipid monolayers must have an energetically unfavorable configuration
at some point in the stack (for instance, with the phospholipid headgroups
exposed to the atmosphere instead of the hydrophobic tails). This
is also evident in the discretized distribution of thicknesses observed
in the entire film, as shown in Figure 3c. Interestingly, the film is more likely to have a
thickness with an integer number of bilayers than the “half”
bilayer immediately preceding it (i.e., 7.8 nm is more common than
5.7 nm, 11.9 nm than 9.8 nm, and 15.6 nm than 13.8 nm). We suspect
that this is due in part to the unfavorable configurations of those
noninteger bilayer regions.

bilayer film

100 μm. (b) Thickness profile along the red line in the image,

cases. The line is the height profile calculated using the Imax and Imin values

within the film showing the stepwise multilayering, with the nominal h/h1 values given above the
peaks. The reflected light intensity saturated for approximately 1%

We have combined interferometry
with logical and reasonable assumptions
on the relationship between different lamellar areas of the film to
determine the sub-10-nanometer-scale thicknesses of lipid thin films.
This result can now be leveraged to directly detect and measure the
thickness differences between coexisting lipid domains in phase-separating
lipid mixtures. Specifically in our case, fluid–gel phase separation
has been extensively documented in the binary DPPC/DOPC phospholipid
bilayer system.49−53 As mentioned in the introduction, the inverse bilayers maintain
the lateral interactions of membrane bilayers while possessing different
midplane interactions; therefore, although we use the same terminology,
the ramifications of these geometric differences on the precise boundaries
and characteristics of the phase diagram remain an open area of research.

To form a uniform film, a smaller pressure gradient is applied
to thin the liquid, which results in a single inverse lipid bilayer
film without any lamellar layers. Doing this at high temperatures
results in a single-phase bilayer with homogeneous fluorescence intensity.
In Figure 4, the lipid
film has been cooled below its phase transition temperature to 37
°C. As mentioned earlier, it is standard practice to detect the
presence of lipid domains by the exclusion of fluorophore from the
more fluid domain, and we observe this in the fluorescence signal
of Figure 4a. However,
the fluorescence signal has no information on the relative thickness
difference between the two phases because it is dictated by the concentration
of fluorescent lipid molecules partitioning between the two phases.
The condensed gel phase consists of phospholipids with rigid hydrocarbon
tails, making these domains in the bilayer thicker than the fluid
phase.

Figure 4 (a) Fluorescence image showing the appearance of dark domains when
the temperature is cooled to 37 °C. (b) Corresponding reflectance
microscopy image appears to show a single black film when unscaled,
but (c) upon adjusting the contrast bright spots are evident in positions
corresponding to the dark domains in the fluorescence image. (d) Magnified
view of a section of the film with the corresponding three-dimensional
thickness map. The thicker gel phase (red) protrudes from the majority
fluid phase (yellow/green). (e) Thickness profile of the black lipid
film across two of the domains in (d), with an illustration of the
gel and fluid phases. The scale bar for panel (a–c) represents
50 μm.

On first glance, the
reflected light intensity channel appears
featureless (Figure 4b), but when increasing the contrast (by linearly rescaling the grayscale
between 8500 and 13 000) and inspecting the reflected light
signal closely, we see changes in intensity in precisely the same
areas of the film where domains are forming according to the fluorescence
signal (Figure 4c).
Thus, reflected light microscopy is capable of distinguishing between
coexisting domains in the thin lipid bilayers, and the increased intensity
of the domain regions is expected because they are thicker due to
the condensed phase lipids. Given the small temperature difference
and the minimal variation of the refractive index with temperature,
we use the Imax and Imin values obtained above to measure the film thickness
in an area of the film where domains are present (Figure 4d). Six domains with radii
∼2 μm are easily distinguished. The brighter/red areas
correspond to the gel phase and have an average thickness of 3.81
± 0.11 nm, whereas the majority fluid phase has an average thickness
of 3.47 ± 0.13 nm. Figure 4e shows the thickness profile (with the average thickness
of the fluid phase subtracted) along two of the domains to more clearly
indicate the overall thickness difference between the two phases of
Δh = 0.34 ± 0.16 nm. The preceding was
calculated based on a laterally uniform film refractive index. Ellipsometric
measurements indicate that the refractive index of DPPC increases
from 1.455 to 1.503 when moving from the liquid expanded to the gel
phase at the water/air monolayer interface,47 and considering an increase in the bilayer refractive index of this
magnitude, the thickness difference between the domains decreases
slightly to 0.17 nm.

Our measurements are in agreement or on
the lower end of the range
when compared with the results obtained from scattering or AFM on
membrane bilayers. García-Sáez et al.11 found height differences ranging from 0.2 to 1.3 nm, depending
on composition, using AFM of ternary lipid mixtures. Giocondi et al.9 used AFM on 3:1 DOPC/DPPC-supported lipid bilayers
and found a height difference of 1.2 nm at 23 °C. Similarly,
SAXS of DOPC/DPPC/cholesterol multilamellar vesicles yielded thicknesses
of 4.6 nm for the liquid ordered phase and 3.9 nm for the liquid disordered
phase,16 whereas SANS of quaternary lipid
mixtures yielded thickness differences between 0.6 and 1 nm.17 The advantage of the present technique rests
on the real-time formation and observation with a simple microscope,
which allows the domains to be imaged directly, their dynamics tracked,
and their shape fluctuations deduced. If the optics of a given experiment
remains constant and Imax and Imin are already calibrated, this technique could
also be potentially applied to measure lipid raft properties without
the use of fluorescent tagging.

Conclusions
Detection
of coexisting lipid domains is important to analyze processes
that mimic “lipid raft”-like processes. Optical fluorescence
measurements are ideal for visualizing individual domains, their shape,
fluctuations or translational dynamics, whereas scattering (or AFM)
methods are needed to measure the thickness variations between phases.
We have combined thin film reflected light microscopy with fluorescence
microscopy to measure the thicknesses of inverse bilayer films. The
temporal and spatial resolutions of the approach are limited only
by the camera and the microscope objective used, respectively. Using
this method, we are able to detect and quantify the thickness differences
in phase-separated domains of inverse phospholipid bilayers, which
are in agreement with that found using standard bilayers. This microscopy-based
method shows promise now to investigate the dynamics of such domains
in conjunction with their height fluctuations. In addition, the appearance
of multilamellar areas in the thin film allows for domain registration
across the lamella to be measured. Lastly, although our current focus
of research is lipid bilayers, this thin film balance-based technique
can be equally extended to study the properties of other molecular
thin films, such as nanoparticles, copolymers, or surfactants.
