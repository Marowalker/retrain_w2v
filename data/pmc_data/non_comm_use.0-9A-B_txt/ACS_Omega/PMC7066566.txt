GTP hydrolysis is central to biology,
being involved in regulating
a wide range of cellular processes. However, the mechanisms by which
GTPases hydrolyze this critical reaction remain controversial, with
multiple mechanistic possibilities having been proposed based on analysis
of experimental and computational data. In this mini-review, we discuss
advances in our understanding of biological GTP hydrolysis based on
recent computational studies and argue in favor of solvent-assisted
hydrolysis as a conserved mechanism among GTPases. A concrete understanding
of the fundamental mechanisms by which these enzymes facilitate GTP
hydrolysis will have significant impact both for drug discovery efforts
and for unraveling the role of oncogenic mutations.

Introduction
Guanosine triphosphate (GTP) hydrolysis
is a biologically crucial
reaction, involved in regulating almost all cellular processes. Therefore,
GTPases are important drug targets and thus the topic of substantial
experimental and computational research effort.1−6 However, there remain many open questions with regard to the preferred
reaction pathway for GTP hydrolysis, as well as the nature of the
corresponding transition states. This continued uncertainty hampers
both our fundamental understanding of biological GTP hydrolysis and
ongoing drug discovery efforts.

It should be noted that phosphoryl
transfer is highly complex,
and even in the seemingly simple case of nonenzymatic GTP hydrolysis,
widely varying mechanistic proposals have been advanced, that can
be grouped into two general categories: solvent-assisted pathways
either with or without general-base catalysis (Figures 1A and B) or a substrate assisted-pathway
in which the phosphate being attacked deprotonates the incoming nucleophile
(Figure 1C, for detailed
discussion see e.g. ref (7)). In the case of the corresponding GTPase-catalyzed
reactions, similar mechanistic proposals have been put forward, focusing
either on the involvement of an active site glutamine as the catalytic
base that activates the nucleophilic water molecule or on substrate-assisted
pathways in which a nonbridging phosphate oxygen of the GTP itself
deprotonates the incoming nucleophile. Neither of these pathways,
however, has been able to satisfactorily account for all key experimental
observables, and no other candidate for the catalytic base exists
in the active sites of these enzymes. It is highly curious how these
enzymes are able to achieve efficient catalysis of GTP hydrolysis
without the presence of an obvious candidate for the catalytic base,
and it has therefore been questioned based on analysis of existing
experimental data whether such a base is even necessary.2

GTP hydrolysis.

with or without general-base catalysis, as well as (C) a substrate-assisted

We recently provided significant advances in addressing this question
by quantitatively reproducing experimental kinetic isotope effects
for the nonenzymatic hydrolysis of a phosphate monoester dianion,8 allowing us to discriminate between different
mechanisms. We then demonstrated that the mechanistic preference is
highly leaving-group dependent, with phosphate monoesters with good
leaving groups such as guanosine diphosphate (GDP) predominantly preferring
to react via loose, dissociative solvent-assisted pathways, whereas
those with poor leaving groups switch to a more compact substrate-assisted
pathway.9 This provided further indications
that maybe the answer to the mechanistic controversy with regard to
enzyme-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis is simply that a solvent-assisted
pathway does not require an explicit general base and that the dominant
mechanism in solution is also the dominant mechanism in the GTPase
active site.7,10 In this mini-review, we will
provide a brief overview of the current state-of-the-art in modeling
biological GTP hydrolysis, including discussing a number of recent
QM/MM and metadynamics studies, in addition to our own recent work.
We will highlight ongoing challenges in modeling these complex systems,
as well as potential future directions for the field, as new mechanistic
insights may make it finally possible to target these historically
“undruggable” enzymes.

Biological GTP Hydrolysis
GTPases are a large superclass of structurally and mechanistically
diverse hydrolytic enzymes, which catalyze the conversion of guanosine
triphosphate (GTP) to guanosine diphosphate (GDP) and inorganic phosphate
(Pi). A key feature of these enzymes is their role as “molecular
switches”, harnessing conformational transitions between active
GTP-bound “ON” states and inactive GDP-bound “OFF”
states to control various cellular processes. In doing so, they regulate
all stages of cellular function, from signaling cascades to cell migration,
polarity, adhesion, cytoskeletal organization, proliferation, and
apoptosis.1 These transitions can involve
fairly significant conformational changes and are facilitated by interaction
with different external regulatory proteins, the so-called “GTPase
activating proteins” (GAPs). These regulatory proteins also
contribute to substantially increasing the rates of GTP hydrolysis
by these enzymes by up to 105-fold, depending on the specific
GTPase-regulatory protein combination.3

While a range of different GTPases exist with different structures
and active site architectures based on biological context,3 the most studied include small GTPases such as
Ras GTPase and Rho GTPase, as well as elongation factors such as elongation
factor thermo-unstable (EF-Tu).5 Although
all these GTPases catalyze the same chemical reaction, the mechanistic
strategies by which this is achieved (and the corresponding catalytic
rates) vary between these different enzymes through their use of active-site
architectures with key differences in the identity and positioning
of the main catalytic residues7 (Figure 2). However, two key
residues are of interest in these enzymes: in small GTPases such as
Ras, of particular interest is the role of an active site arginine,
the so-called “arginine finger”,3 which is either inserted into the active site by the regulatory
protein (as in Ras and Rab, Figures 2A and B) or intrinsic to the GTPase (as in Gαi, Figure 2C) and which
provides additional electrostatic stabilization to the transition
state. In addition, an active site glutamine (in the case of Ras,
Rab, and Gαi, Figures 2A to C) or histidine (Figure 2D) acts to position the nucleophile in an
optimal position for nucleophile attack on the γ-phosphate of
the GTP.

Figure 2 Active sites of three different signaling proteins: (A) RasGAP
in complex with AlF3 (AF3) and a phosphonate GDP analogue
(GNP) (PDB ID: 1WQ1(11,12)), (B) human Rab1 in complex with the GTPase activating
protein (GAP) domain of TBC1D20 and BeF3– (BEF) (PDB ID: 4HLQ(12,13)), and (C) the α-subunit of a heterotrimeric
G protein in complex with GDP and AlF4– (ALF) (PDB ID: 1AGR(12,14)). Shown here for comparison is also the active site
of (D) Elongation Factor Thermo unstable (EF-Tu) in complex with a
GTP analogue (GCP, E. coli numbering) (PDB ID: 4V5L(12,15)). Residues from each GTPase are highlighted in gray, and from the
GAPs in cyan. The residues inserted by the regulatory proteins are
specifically (A) the arginine finger in the RasGAP complex, (B) the
arginine and glutamine fingers in the RabGAP complex. In case (C),
the arginine (Arg178) and glutamine (Gln204) are intrinsic to the
GTPase itself, and the catalytic stimulation by the regulatory protein
is thus entirely allosteric through a so-called “dual-finger
mechanism”. Adapted with permission from ref (7) (direct link: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.9b03193). Copyright 2019 American Chemical Society.

There has been significant debate about the roles of both the glutamine
and histidine in catalysis by these enzymes, focusing in particular
on whether they act as an active site base to activate catalytic water
molecule or merely act to position it in the active site through hydrogen
bonding interactions. In the case of EF-Tu, structural information
suggested that the histidine acts as a general base,15 but computational studies have indicated that this histidine
is in fact most likely protonated due to a greatly elevated pKa.16,17 It has similarly been
suggested that the active site glutamine can take on a similar role
in Ras and related enzymes, largely due to the absence of other obvious
general bases in the active site (see discussion in e.g. refs (2 and 7)); however, once
again due to the extremely low pKa of
the carbonyl group (estimated to be ∼ –2), this scenario
is unlikely, raising the question of what the mechanism of catalysis
actually is, and, here, computational work can play a significant
role in unraveling putative mechanistic pathways as well as the role
of the regulatory proteins in facilitating catalysis. We note that
we have discussed the potential biological role of the Mg2+ in detail in earlier work7 (see also
references cited therein) and, therefore, do not repeat it here.

Recent
Computational Studies
Molecular simulations have historically
played an important role
in expanding our understanding of biological GTP hydrolysis.5 Our focus here will be on contributions made
by recent computational work on Ras and related enzymes; note that
in the interest of space conservation, we do not discuss here computational
work on elongation factors, as this has been discussed in great detail
elsewhere.18

There has been extensive
research efforts in understanding the
mechanism of GTPases, including the protonation state of the substrate.
In particular, a neutron diffraction study of Ras in complex with
the GTP analogue GppNHp suggested potential protonation of the analogue,19 arguing that the Ras active site significantly
increases the pKa of the bound nucleotide
and questioned the conventional view that the nucleotide is fully
deprotonated. However, this was challenged by Mann and co-workers,20 who computed infrared and NMR spectra from QM/MM
simulations, which were compared to prior work. They also provided
novel spectra of GTP and several GTP analogues bound to lipidated
Ras, on a membrane system under near-native conditions, confirming
that the nucleotide is indeed bound to Ras in its fully deprotonated
form at the start of the hydrolysis reaction and is not protonated.
In detailed crystallographic and quantum chemical analysis of an analogous
system, a quaternary complex of Rho·GAP·GDP·Pi,21 the authors argue for a complex network
of hydrogen bonds and sequential proton transfers, including two low-barrier
hydrogen bonds (LBHB) introduced by the GAP, that facilitate reaction
progress and product release.

We note that the proton shuttling
proposed in ref (21) is based on the assumption
of a substrate-assisted pathway (Figure 1C), in which the attacking water molecule
in the Rho active site is initially deprotonated by the bound nucleotide.
Similar assumptions of mobile protons have been put forward for Ras22 and hGBP1,23,24 in the former
case involving the active site glutamine shown in Figure 2, and in the latter case a
more complex proton transfer chain involving multiple active site
side chains and an intermediary water molecule. However, both ref (22) and refs (23 and 24) have suggested that the mechanisms
involved for Ras and hGBP1, respectively, are complex and that the
preferred mechanism can be modulated by mutations.

In a recent
study, we proposed a much simpler model for GTP hydrolysis
by Ras and related enzymes, building on our early work on the nonenzymatic
reaction.7,8,10 Specifically,
we performed detailed empirical valence bond simulations to compare
solvent- and substrate-assisted pathways in three distinct GTPases:
Ras, Rab, and the Gαi subunit of a heterotrimeric
G-protein, both in the presence and in the absence of the corresponding
GTPase activating (GAP/RGS) proteins.7 Our
results, which are in excellent agreement with experimental observables,
demonstrate that, in all cases, the preferred mechanism for GTP hydrolysis
is a conserved solvent-assisted pathway by at least 7 kcal mol–1, eliminating the need for a general base in the active
site (Figure 3). This
pathway involves the rate-limiting nucleophilic attack of a water
molecule, leading to a short-lived intermediate that tautomerizes
to form H2PO4– and GDP as
the final products (Figures 1A and 3). This solvent assisted model
is in excellent agreement with experimental data, that have suggested
a loose dissociative transition state for GTP hydrolysis in the Ras
and RasGAP active sites, as well as analysis of kinetic data, which
suggests that there is little kinetic benefit to deprotonation of
the nucleophile (for details, see e.g. ref (2) and references cited therein).
We note that a similar transition state has also been hinted at for
RhoA-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis, based on 19F NMR experiments
and quantum chemical calculations,25 further
strengthening our hypothesis that this mechanism is conserved among
Ras and related enzymes.7

profiles for the (A) solvent- and (B) substrate-assisted
hydrolysis of GTP in aqueous solution, and as catalyzed by Ras and
the RasGAP complex. (C) Activation free energies for each of the two
mechanisms, as catalyzed by a range of GTPases (Ras, Rab and Gαι, both with and without their corresponding regulatory
proteins, as well as the Ras Q61H mutant). Note that as shown in panel
A, the initial phosphoryl transfer reaction in the solvent-assisted
hydrolysis of GTP leads to a short-lived intermediate (INT), which
will then tautomerize to yield the final product, which is chemically
identical to the final product state for the substrate-assisted pathway.
A similar pathway was observed in quantum chemical calculations of
phosphate esters in aqueous solution.8−10 For further details,

In our recent work,7 we also made two
key observations with regard to the role of the GAP protein (or RGS
protein in the case of Gαι): (1) that the GAP/RGS
protein sequesters the active site from solvent, thus affecting the
local dielectric constant of the active site, contributing to the
enhancement of the GTP hydrolysis rate, and (2) that the GAP/RGS protein
rigidifies the active site, both reducing its volume and reducing
the conformational space of the catalytically critical arginine and
glutamine residues (Figure 2), thus creating a better preorganized active site and facilitating
efficient catalysis. Our first observation is further supported by
molecular dynamics and QM/MM studies performed by Tichauer et al.,26,27 who have explored water distributions and electron density within
wild-type NRas and Q61 mutants. This work has shown that the precise
placement of water molecules in the active site is important and that
substitution of Q61 (ideally GDP-like) not only leads to displacement
of water molecules from the active site but also disrupts the electron
density of the bound nucleotide, which can explain the reduced hydrolysis
rate when this residue is mutated. Interestingly, however, and as
also pointed out by the authors, significant differences in the water
distribution at the active site are observed when comparing results
from pure classical molecular dynamics to those obtained from hybrid
QM/MM molecular dynamics simulations.27 Here, the QM/MM molecular dynamics results provide better agreement
with a putative catalytically favorable conformation of the enzyme.
Our second observation is further supported by a μs time scale
molecular dynamics simulation study by Sayyed-Ahmed et al.,28 who explored the dynamics of both wild-type
H- and K-Ras as well as variants carrying the oncogenic G12D, G12V,
and G13D variants. They demonstrated that the oncogenic variants led
to altered conformational ensembles of the protein, in particular
involving differences in both flexibility of and coupling between
the switch regions of the protein, as well as in intraprotein and
intermolecular interactions and fluctuations. This in turn has implications
for Ras GTPase regulation and activity, including effector or exchange
factor binding, as well as Ras dimerization and Ras–membrane
interactions.

Conclusions and Outlook
It is clear
that due to their biological importance and their role
in regulating cellular signaling pathways, GTPases are important drug
targets, in particular for cancer therapeutics. However, targeting
these enzymes is nontrivial, leading GTPases such as Ras to be described
as “undruggable” (although recent years have seen growing
reason for optimism29−31). Part of the challenge has come from the fact that,
despite a tremendous wealth of kinetic, biochemical, structural, and
computational data, the catalytic mechanisms and mode of regulation
of these enzymes remain controversial,2,4,5 in no small part due to the tremendous complexity
of this seemingly simple reaction. Here, we show that molecular simulation
can be a valuable tool to rationalize experimental data and predict
mechanisms, provided the simulation model can predict all key experimental
observables, and a number of key recent studies have been described
in this mini-review. We believe that the strongest evidence from the
computational indicates that a solvent-assisted pathway is the most
likely operative pathway in Ras and related enzymes, as expected from
experimental work.2 The insight these studies
provide is an important step forward both to be able to finally target
the undruggable as well as for rationalizing the role of oncogenic
mutants.
