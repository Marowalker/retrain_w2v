Tubulin polymerization is critical
in mitosis process, which regulates
uncontrolled cell divisions. Here, we report a new class of pyrene-pyrazole
pharmacophore (PPP) for targeting microtubules. Syntheses of seven
pyrenyl-substituted pyrazoles with side-chain modification at N-1
and C-3 positions of the pyrazole ring were accomplished from alkenyl
hydrazones via C–N dehydrogenative cross-coupling using copper
catalyst under aerobic condition. Tubulin polymerization
with PPPs was investigated using docking and biological tools to reveal
that these ligands are capable of influencing microtubule polymerization
and their interaction with α-, β-tubulin active binding
sites, which are substituent specific. Furthermore, cytotoxicity response
of these PPPs was tested on cancer cells of different origin, such
as MCF-7, MDA-MB231, and C32, and also noncancerous normal cells,
such as MCF-10A. All newly synthesized PPPs showed excellent anticancer
activities. The anticancer activities and half-maximal inhibitory
concentration (IC50) values of all PPPs across different
cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB231, and C32) have been demonstrated.
1,3-Diphenyl-5-(pyren-1-yl)-1H-pyrazole was found
to be best among all other PPPs in killing significant population
of all of the cancerous cell with IC50 values 1 ±
0.5, 0.5 ± 0.2, and 5.0 ± 2.0 μM in MCF-7, MDA-MB231,
and C32 cells, respectively.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Microtubules
are dynamic protein filaments assembled from tubulin
subunits, α and β.1 They are
generally involved in cell division, movement, intracellular trafficking,
and mitosis.2 Microtubules are long, hollow
cylindrical rods that are formed by polymerization of subunits.3 Microtubules targeting ligands affect their dynamics
to act as strong inhibitor or facilitator for cell proliferation.4 Tubulin dimers are known to bind with proteins
as well as small molecules that either stabilize or inhibit microtubule
polymerization.5 In the context of cancer,
the tubulin families of proteins are recognized as the target of the
tubulin-binding chemotherapeutics, which suppress the dynamics of
the mitotic spindle to cause mitotic arrest and cell death.6 Importantly, changes in microtubule stability
and the expression of different tubulin isotypes, as well as altered
post-translational modifications, have been reported for a range of
cancers.7 These changes have been correlated
with poor prognosis and chemotherapy resistance in solid and hematological
cancers.8 Although, microtubule polymerization-influencing
agents are widely used in combination therapy for the treatment of
a few malignancies, its broad application is largely hampered by their
relative toxicity, complex synthesis method, and developing multidrug
resistance.9 With this background, there
has been a renewed interest in the development of potent microtubule
polymerization-influencing agents that circumvent one or more of these
issues.

In this work, we disclose a rational design and syntheses
of a
series of pyrene-pyrazole compounds as antimitotic agents. Taking
into account the biological importance of pyrazole10,11 and fluorophoric behavior of a pyrene moiety,12 including their formation of excimer in presence of tubulin,13 we hypothesized that pyrene-pyrazole-based pharmacophores
(PPPs) may modulate chemical extremities of the agent, which can further
vary the interaction pattern during tubulin polymerization.

Herein, we report copper triflate-catalyzed synthesis of new pyrene-pyrazole
pharmacophore (PPP1–7) from alkenyl hydrazones via cross-dehydrogenative
coupling14 under aerobic condition. The
effect of these new agents for microtubule polymerization was studied
by biophysical methods and their molecular mechanism also been studied
using biological and physicochemical experiments. Results indicate
that members of this pyrene-pyrazole family of pharmacophores exhibited
potent tubulin polymerization inhibition and cellular cytotoxicity
in breast cancer cells.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis of Pyrene-Pyrazole Pharmacophore
We have designed
seven new molecules possessing pyrene-pyrazole core structure. Analogues
were designed with side-chain modification at N-1 and C-3 positions
of the pyrazole ring, introducing hydrogen, phenyl, methyl, biphenyl,
benzothiazolyl, and carboxylic acid moieties. As an effort to develop
highly efficient and mild reactions for chemical synthesis, a concept
of copper-catalyzed cross-dehydrogenative coupling reaction was developed.
First, we optimized the reaction with 1d as test substrate
using copper triflate (Cu(OTf)2) as catalyst in the presence
of varied oxidants in toluene at 80 °C. The reaction readily
furnished to give 2d in 46% yield in presence of air
(Scheme 1). In a set
of oxidant screening, K2S2O8 and tert-butyl hydroperoxide give 2d in 42 and
38% yield, respectively.

Isolated yield.

The syntheses of PPPs (2) from substituted
alkenyl
hydrazones (1) were achieved in presence of optimized
reaction condition (Scheme 1). In a typical procedure, the substrate comprising a phenyl
group at N-1 position and methyl group at C-3 position in alkenyl
hydrazone (1a) underwent reaction to produce the corresponding
PPP1 (2a) in 58% yield, whereas substrate having biphenyl
group in N-1 position in alkenyl hydrazone (1b) afforded
product PPP2 (2b) in 53% yield.

It is noteworthy
that the reaction of benzothiazolyl alkenyl hydrazone
(1c) readily occurred to furnish corresponding PPP3 (2c). In addition, substrate-bearing phenyl group at N-1 and
C-3 position in alkenyl hydrazone (1d) was also compatible
in this methodology to provide corresponding 1,3-diphenyl-5-(pyren-1-yl)-1H-pyrazole (PPP4) (2d), while gratifyingly,
biphenyl group at N-1 position in alkenyl hydrazone moiety (1e) afforded PPP5 (2e) in 52% yield. A similar
result was observed with substrate 1f bearing hydrogen
atom in the N-1 position of alkenyl hydrazone, producing PPP6 (2f) in 43% yield. Furthermore, the reaction of acetophenone
with dimethyl oxalate produced A. Next, compound A underwent reaction with phenyl hydrazine readily in this
methodology to produce intermediate B via C–N
bond formation in one pot. The intermediate B was treated
with KOH/MeOH to produce PPP7 (2g) in 62% yield (Scheme 2). However, in the
absence of Cu(OTf)2, compound A failed to
produce corresponding product, compound B. Therefore,
our results indicated that a catalytic amount of Cu(OTf)2 is a critical requirement for the successful conversion. The crude
PPPs were purified by silica gel (70–200 mesh) column chromatography
using ethyl acetate and hexane as eluents. The structure of the purified
ligands was confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR studies
and mass spectrometry (MS) analyses (Figures S1–S9). Fluorescence spectroscopy measurements taken over a pH ranging
from ∼3 to 8 found that all dyes exhibited a stable fluorescence
emission in the blue range across all tested pH values (Figures S22–S24).

2.2 Effect of PPPs on Microtubule Polymerization
To gather further insight into the molecular mechanism of action
of PPPs, an in vitro cytoskeleton assay was carried out to investigate
the effect of these agents on microtubule polymerization (Figure 1). In this protocol,
85 μL of 10 mg/mL tubulin stock was incubated with tubulin glycerol
buffer for 1.5 h at 37 °C in the presence of various PPPs at
a fixed concentration (20 mM). Following this, the degree of tubulin
polymerization was evaluated by observing their fluorescence profile
with time.

Figure 1 In vitro microtubule polymerization assay. Assays were conducted
using purified tubulins to form polymerized tubules in presence of
various PPPs. An increase in relative fluorescence intensity (RFU)
was obtained for paclitaxel (PTXL), along with PPP1 to PPP7, barring
PPP5, suggesting that the later supports microtubule formation. RFU
decreased for PPP5 with time, suggesting that it inhibits microtubule
formation.

The content of polymerized microtubules
was monitored by measuring
fluorescence intensity at 430 nm (λex = 350 nm) every
7 s for 1.5 h. Paclitaxel (PTXL), a well-known microtubule stabilizer,
was added to the assay as a positive control, whereas the tubulin
glycerol buffer acted as a negative control. An increase in the fluorescence
intensity was observed, indicating that PTXL is stabilizing the tubulin
polymerization reaction. An increased fluorescence intensity was observed
for PPP1 to PPP7, except PPP5, showing a similar trend to PTXL. This
implies that addition of PPP1–7 into the assay led to a stabilization
of microtubule polymerization. Interestingly, for PPP5, the fluorescence
intensity was found to be decreasing over time, suggesting an inhibition
of microtubule polymerization, similar to known microtubule destabilizing
agents, such as nocodazole.15 Further inspection
to correlate between the obtained trend in tubulin polymerization
and modifications attempted at the N-1 and C-3 positions yielded interesting
observations. Keeping methyl group at C-3 position and changing the
N-1 position from phenyl group (PPP1) to biphenyl group (PPP2) lead
to an increased degree of tubulin polymerization (Figure 1). Furthermore, keeping a phenyl
group at N-1 position fixed and varying at C-3 positions from methyl
(PPP1) to phenyl group (PPP4) lead to a drastic increase in the tubulin
polymerization, as seen from Figure 1. Finally, keeping the phenyl group at C-3 positions
fixed and changing the N-1 position from phenyl (PPP2) to biphenyl
group (PPP5) lead to a decrease in the efficiency of tubulin polymerization.
Hence, an interplay with the modifications at C-3 and N-1 positions
leads to increased tubulin polymerization. However, substantial increase
in the bulkiness of the groups at N-1 positions leads to decreased
rate for tubulin polymerization (PPP5).

2.3 Effect
of PPPs on Electrophoretic Mobility
of Tubulin
With this promising result, we further focused
on confirming the polymerization of microtubules. PPP–tubulin
mixtures were collected from the abovementioned assay, and a sodium
dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was
performed to separate both tubulin as well as polymerized tubulin
from the mixture. Figure 2a shows the bands from SDS-PAGE gel, which was subsequently
stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. Two distinct bands were obtained,
one in the region of 40–55 kDa, which is consistent with the
molecular weight of α-, β-tubulin,16 and other in the region of 130 kDa. This is presumably
a result of tubulin polymerization. A semiquantitative analysis of
the polymerized tubulin bands was performed using FIJI17 to calculate the band intensities, as shown
in Figure 2b. Fold
change of band intensities was further calculated with respect to
PPP5–tubulin mixture (Figure 2c).

Figure 2 (a) Coomassie-stained gel lanes
for tubulin–dye mixtures, showing two migrating populations,
polymerized tubulin (∼130 kDa MW), and α-, β-tubulin
(∼50 kDa MW). A representative molecular weight standard lane
is also shown across the sample lanes for comparison. (b) Comparison
of optical intensity of polymerized tubulin for different mixtures
was calculated using FIJI and (c) corresponding fold change was calculated
with respect to PPP5–tubulin mixture, which showed the least
optical intensity.

From the results, it
was evident that the band intensity for PPP5–tubulin
was the least amongst all PPP–tubulin mixtures, possibly indicating
structural interferences from PPP5 hindering the polymerization process
of tubulin. As evident, PPP5 had contrasting spectroscopic features
compared to the rest of the PPP analogues presumably due to the presence
of N-1 biphenyl moiety and a bulkier structure.

2.4 In Silico Response of PPPs on Tubulin Interaction
Target
selectivity of synthesized PPPs could be studied with in
silico model of tubulin protein. It also provides information about
three-dimensional (3D) orientation and interaction pattern of PPP–tubulin
protein complex. To achieve it, mechanistic understanding of PPPs
binding to tubulin structure was obtained from molecular docking studies.
For the simulation work, X-ray crystallographic 3D structure of tubulin
α- and β-dimer (PDB code: 1tub) was downloaded from the online protein
data bank (http://www.pdb.org). The structures of both α- and β-tubulin are similar,
wherein each monomer is composed of two β-sheets covered by
α-helices. The structure shows three possible binding sites
for ligands, including bound guanosine-5′-triphosphate (GTP)
in α-tubulin and guanosine-5′-diphosphate (GDP) and Taxotere
(TAX) bound to β-tubulin (Figure 3a,b). To provide insights into the binding site of
different PPP molecules into α-, β-tubulin, a preliminary
molecular docking was performed using Chimera.18 The minimum binding energy indicated that α-, β-tubulin
was successfully docked with PPPs. Interestingly, on the basis of
this criterion, PPPs were shown to bind in different sites on α-,
β-tubulin on the basis of their structures.

Figure 3 (a) Structure of α-
and β-tubulin, highlighting the
different active sites present, namely, GDP, TAX, and GTP; (b) side
view of the α-, β-tubulin protein. (c–j) Docking
studies were performed to see the binding location of PPP1, PPP4,
PPP6, and PPP7 in α-, β-tubulin; and corresponding surface
representation was used to show the binding pocket of the docked molecule
in α-, β-tubulin.

PPP1 (Figure 3c,d)
and PPP3 were shown to bind into GDP pocket having a minimum binding
energy of −7.97 and −8.09 kcal/mol, respectively (Table 1).

However, PPP2, PPP4 (Figure 3e,f), PPP5, PPP6 (Figure 3g,h), and PPP7 (Figure 3i,j) were shown to
bind into the TAX pocket, which
is similar to where PTXL binds. It is interesting to observe that
C-1 substitution with a methyl group usually tends to direct the molecules
(PPP1, 3) to GDP pocket. However, a substituent at N-1 presumably
influences the molecule and introduces to the TAX pocket, as seen
for the case of PPP2.

2.5 Cytotoxicity Response of
PPPs on Cancer Cells
of Different Origin
As the process of tubulin polymerization
was found to be modulated by PPPs in biological assay, their functional
activity (i.e., cytotoxicity) needed to be verified in vitro. An in
vitro cancer cell two-dimensional culture model was used for this
study using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay.19

It was found
that all of the PPPs were effective in killing a significant population
of MCF-7 cells. PPP4 was found to be causing the maximum damage (Figure 4a) with a cell growth
inhibition by 50% at a concentration of 1 ± 0.5 μM. When
compared for % cell population inhibited by drug molecules at 10 μM,
PPP4 with only 30 ± 3% viable cells was significantly less than
PPP1, PPP2, PPP3, PPP5, PPP6, and PPP7 with 50 ± 5, 45 ±
3, 52 ± 5, 70 ± 10, 55 ± 5, and 50 ± 5% of viable
cells, respectively.

MCF-7.
(a) MTT assay results from 48 h treatment of MCF-7 cells at different
concentrations. (b) Comparison of cell growth inhibition for different
formulations at 10 μM incubation.

Taxol, a well-established tubulin polymerization drug, was
used
as a positive control and found to be inhibiting the cell growth level
to only 42 ± 10%, very much comparable with PPP4 (Figure 4b). Similar results were obtained
from a cell growth density study where maximum loss in MCF-7 cell
growth density was obtained from PPP4 incubations at 1 μM, which
was very comparable with Taxol treatment (Figure S25).

Broad spectrum effect of these molecules was studied
by introducing
more cells of cancer origin, while their selectivity toward cancer
was established by studying noneffective nature in normal cells of
same origin. It was found that all of the PPPs were effective in killing
a significant population of MDA-MB231 (Figure 5A,B) and C32 (Figure 5C,D) cells. Similar to MCF-7 cells, PPP4
was found to be causing the maximum damage with second best effect
by PPP7. It was found that MDA-MB231 and C32 cell growth inhibition
by 50% was achieved by PPP4 at a concentration of 0.5 ± 0.2 and
5.0 ± 2.0 μM, respectively, whereas by PPP7 at a concentration
of 10 ± 2.0 and 14 ± 2.0 μM, respectively (Figure 5B,D). Comparative
half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values for
all of the molecules showed a trend of PPP4 < PPP7 < PPP1 <
PPP2 < PPP3 < PPP5 < PPP6 across all of the cancer cell lines
used (Table 2).

PPP Analogues across MCF-7, MDA-MB231, and C32 Cell Lines

MCF-7	60 ± 10	34 ± 4	>100	1 ± 0.5	>100	43 ± 5	8 ± 2	
MDA-MB231	>100	15 ± 5	>100	0.5 ± 0.2	>100	>100	10 ± 2.0	
C32	>100	>100	>100	5.0 ± 2.0	>100	>100	14 ± 2.0	
Effectivity of anticancer
drugs not only depends on cancer inhibition
property but minimum effect to noncancerous normal cells. A representative
study was performed on MCF-10A cells of noncancerous nature and human
breast origin. It was found that representative molecules of PPP1,
PPP4, and PPP7 did not result in any significant cell death at a treatment
concentration of 10 μM where similar concentration of PPPs in
MCF-7, MDA-MB231, and C32 showed cell growth inhibition of more than
50% (Figure 5E). It
indicates the selectivity of PPPs toward cancer cells, presumably
due to higher variation in tubulin polymerization processes.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, a new class of pyrene-pyrazole
analogues were synthesized
through a remarkably simple copper-catalyzed cross-dehydrogenative
coupling. As an effort to develop highly efficient and mild reactions
for chemical synthesis, copper triflate-catalyzed reaction afforded
seven potent microtubule polymerization-modulating agents under aerobic
condition.

Our results outline a distinct molecular mechanism
of action for
the inhibition of microtubule assembly by a new class of agents based
on pyrene-pyrazole heterocyclic core structure. Success of the synthesis
followed by biological and docking studies further provided a structural
basis for the rational design of potent microtubule polymerization-modulating
agents. The new pyrene-pyrazole analogues showed excellent activity
in the tubulin assembly assay and significantly decreased activity
against MCF-7 cell proliferation. It turns out that the substitution
at C-1 and sterically demanding substituents at N-1 are key factors
to drive the location of their binding inside tubulin sites. The most
active agent showed comparable cell growth inhibition to Taxol. The
full medicinal potential of these lipophilic agents warrants future
studies. This can be addressed by formulation and other drug delivery
approaches, and it is beyond the scope of this preliminary report.
Our in vitro results demonstrated significant anticancer activity
with these newly identified and synthesized compounds. We envision
nanoparticle-enabled delivery of these agents to address their solubility.
To fully understand their biological activity, an in-depth preclinical
study is warranted and will be undertaken in the near future. Results
reported here may open up opportunities for the development of novel
microtubule-targeting pharmacophores and next-generation antibody–drug
conjugates for cancer therapy.

4.7 Docking Studies
Protein–ligand
docking studies were performed for compounds against tubulin α-
and β-dimer (PDB code: 1tub) using Chimera.18

4.8 MTT Assay
The cell viability of PPPs
was investigated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) reduction assay in the presence of 10% fetal bovine
serum in antibiotic free media. The yellow tetrazolium salt (MTT)
is modified by mitochondrial dehydrogenases to its purple formazan
derivative (MTT-formazan) with maximum absorbance at 560–570
nm. The intensity of purple formazans indirectly reveals the mammalian
cell survival and proliferation. Experiment was performed in 96-well
plates (Cellstar, Germany) growing 10 000 cells (MCF-7, MDA-MB231,
and MCF-10A) per well for 24 h before treatments. Experiments were
performed for various concentrations of PPPs ranging from 105 to 100 nM and compared with Taxol as positive control
ranging from 102 to 10–3 nM, as described
in particular experiment. Cells were incubated for 48 h before performing
the MTT assay. At the end of the incubation period, cells were treated
with MTT (20 μL, 5 mg/mL) per well and further incubated for
4 h. At the end of the incubation, the entire medium was removed from
the wells and 200 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added
to dissolve blue-colored formazan crystals produced by mitochondrial
respirations. The percentage cell viability was obtained by calculating
absorbance values and calculated using the formula %viability = {[A630(treated
cells) – (background)]/[A630(untreated cells) – background]}
× 100.
