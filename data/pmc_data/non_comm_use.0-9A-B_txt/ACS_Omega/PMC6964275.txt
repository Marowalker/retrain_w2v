Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed
for
the adsorption of different isomers of 6-mercaptopurine on the Au(001)
surface. All of the configurations of four thione and two thiol isomers
were considered. The results show that the thione isomers adsorbed
more strongly on the Au(001) surface compared with the thiol ones.
In all of the configurations, the calculated binding energy of ma-8 is the largest, in which the S atom of 6-mercaptopurine
binds strongly with one Au atom on the monodentate sites and 6-mercaptopurine
retains a flat geometry, predominantly with an approximately 30°
orientation between the C–S bond and the Au–Au bond
of the catalyst. Additionally, the 6-mercaptopurines in ma-2, mb-5, and mc-3 also bind more strongly
onto the surface, which show relatively higher stability on the surfaces,
indicating a high preference for adsorption. Charge density differences
and TDOS analyses for the four configurations also show that the electronic
charges are accumulated between Au and S atoms in the Au–S
bonds, indicating occurrence of adsorption and chemical-bond formation.

Introduction
Gold has been used in many technological
applications in the field
of nanomaterials because of its high chemical stability, interesting
optical properties, and good biocompatibility.1 Therefore, the surfaces of gold materials were extensively employed
as a platform in building different devices based on the bottom-up
approach either from the gas phase or from liquid media under ambient
conditions. Thiol self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on gold were discovered
in the early 80 s and since then have attracted the interest of both
the surface science and nanotechnology communities.2,3 These
monolayers are robust and easy to prepare and represent fundamental
building blocks for creating complex structures for a wide variety
of nanotechnological applications, as they are simple means to link
inorganic, organic, and biological materials to both planar and nanostructured
gold surfaces.4 Specifically, thiol self-assembly
becomes the simplest and most efficient route for functionalizing
all kinds of substrate topographies including single crystals, polycrystals,
and nanoparticles (NPs). This strategy permits us not only to design
surfaces with controlled physical and chemical properties but also
to perform additional chemical reactions to build complex molecular
systems with specific activity. Nowadays, a wide range of thiol-based
applications on gold surfaces are found in medicine, biochemistry,
catalysis, and electronics.5 Because of
the complexity of nanoparticle surfaces, researchers have been using
solid surfaces to study various facets of Au nanoparticle surfaces.
Carefully designed experimental studies have been undertaken on the
adsorption of thiol species such as 6-mercaptopurine on the Au(100),6 Au(111),6 and Au(001)7 surfaces and hexanethiol on the Au(100) surface.8

6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) is
one of the thiol family
for which its interaction with Au surfaces has been studied theoretically6−9 and experimentally.6−15 Maza et al.6 investigated the self-assembled
monolayers (SAMs) of 6-MP on the Au(100) – (1
× 1) and Au(111) – (1 × 1) surfaces to understand
the interplay of molecule–substrate interactions for heterocyclic
thiols capable of binding to the surface by two anchors, which spontaneously
form a highly disordered film on Au(111). Carro et al.7 reported a different scenario for 6-MP on
the Au(001) – (5 × 20) reconstructed surface and showed
that 6-MP lifts the reconstruction upon adsorption and
ejects a large excess of gold adatoms. Their results show that 6-MP molecules prefer to arrange in highly ordered adatom-free
domains in the bridging configuration, while the ejected adatoms form
gold islands. Even though there are many reports to support the experimental
results, some fundamental questions remain unanswered including: (1)
What are the adsorbed configuration of thione and thiol on the Au
surfaces? (2) Which one of the 6-MP isomers can stably
adsorb on Au surfaces? (3) What are the corresponding adsorption energies?
In this work, we provide answers to some of these questions by carrying
out detailed density functional theory (DFT) based calculations.

In particular, the present work aims to elucidate the interactions
of all different isomers of the thiones and thiols of 6-MP on the Au(001) surface to gain useful information about the most
stable configurations of 6-MP on the Au surface. In the
following, we give a brief description of our theoretical procedure,
which is followed by a discussion of the results.

Results and Discussion
Thione Isomer Adsorption on the Au(001) Surface
6-MP(1,7) Isomer Adsorption Configurations
Based on whether one hydrogen atom is linked to the S atom, the 6-MP isomers can be categorized into two isomers, thione isomers
and thiol isomers. For the thione isomers, according to refs16, 17, there are four predominant isomers of 6-MP(1,7), 6-MP(1,9), 6-MP(3,9),
and 6-MP(3,7). For thiol isomers, there are two isomers
for consideration: 6-MP(7,10) and 6-MP(9,10). We tried our best to check all of the possible adsorption modes,
including monodentate and bridging bidentate, as illustrated in Scheme 1. The monodentate
state can be categorized into two types, thione and thiol isomers.
We sampled three types of adsorption modes for thione and thiol isomers
on the Au(001) surface according to Figure 1.

Figure 1 Chemical structure of the 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP)
molecule.

Scheme 1 Adsorption Mode of 6-MP Isomer Molecules on the Au
Surface
Since the 6-MP(1,7) isomer is the
most stable isomer
in the gaseous phase, eight relatively stable configurations for this
isomer on the Au(001) surface were first constructed, as shown in Figure 2. They are named ma-1, ma-2, ma-3, ma-4, ma-5, ma-6, ma-7, and ma-8. In Figure 2, the
front, side, and top views of adsorption geometries are presented.
The selected geometric parameters of the adsorbed 6-MP isomers are listed in Table 1, and the corresponding adsorption energies with inclusion
of the vdW correction are also given in Table 2. After optimization, it is found that the
most stable geometries of the adsorbed species have the monodentate
type except for ma-2 which has the bridging bidentate
type. In all cases, 6-MP(1,7) formed S–Au coordination
bonds on the surface except for ma-4 and ma-5 cases. In these two cases, the shortest distances are 2.86 Å
of H–Au for ma-4 and 3.28 Å of S–Au
for ma-5, which shows that 6-MP is physisorbed
in these two complexes and the corresponding interactions are very
weak. In ma-1, ma-3, ma-6, ma-7, and ma-8 complexes, the S–Au bond distances are 2.62, 2.52, 2.57,
2.58, and 2.52 Å, respectively. Specifically, in ma-2, a Au–S–Au bridging bidentate bond is formed with
a bond angle of 75.3°.

As shown in configurations from ma-1 to ma-8 in Figure 2, the 6-MP(1,7) isomer can also adsorb onto the Au (001)
surface
leading to S–Au bond formation. It can be seen from Table 2 that ma-8 has the largest adsorption energy, −21.56 kcal/mol. The second
most stable configuration is ma-2, with an adsorption
energy of −17.77 kcal/mol. In ma-2, the 6-MP(1,7) isomer is bridged to the Au atom on the surface
via two S–Au bonds with lengths of 2.58 and 2.62 Å. The
dihedral angle between the purine ring and the Au surface is about
30°. The ma-3 and ma-6 are relatively
less stable with adsorption energies of −14.06 and −12.38
kcal/mol, respectively. The optimized configuration of ma-3 is slightly different compared with that of ma-6, with
a vertical S–Au bond in ma-3 and with a reclining
S–Au bond in ma-6. In ma-3, the S–Au
bond distance is 2.52 Å, and in ma-6, it is 2.57
Å. In configuration ma-1, the 6-MP(1,7) isomer bridges to the Au surface with a S–Au bond length
of 2.62 Å. This geometry is very similar to configuration ma-6 except for the angle difference. In ma-6, the dihedral angle between the purine ring and Au surface is about
0, being almost parallel relative to the surface. In ma-1, the dihedral angle between the purine ring and the Au surface is
almost 30°. In configuration ma-7, the dihedral
angle is similar to that in ma-6. In configurations ma-4 and ma-5, the 6-MP(1,7) isomer
did not link to the Au surface, and the corresponding Au–S
distance in ma-5 is 3.28 Å. The adsorption geometries
in Figure 2 also show
that 6-MP in ma-4 and ma-5 interact
with the surface only by long-range weak interactions. S–Au
σ-bonds were not found for any of the stably adsorbed geometries.
This suggests that they bind very loosely to the Au surface. In other
words, on the Au(001) surface, the bridging bidentate is more favorable
for the 6-MP(1,7) isomer. In ma-8, the S
atom of 6-MP binds strongly with one Au atom on the monodentate
sites and 6-MP retains a flat geometry, predominantly
with about a 30° orientation between the C–S bond of 6-MP and the Au–Au bond of the surface.

6-MP(1,9) Isomer Adsorption Configurations
6-MP(1,9) is different from 6-MP(1,7) because
the hydrogen atom links to the N(9) atom instead of the N(7) atom.
Both of these isomers are thione configurations. According to refs (16) and (17), the relative energies
of these two isomers are very similar (relative energy is 3.0 kcal/mol
at B3LYP/6-31 + G**[Ref (16)]), so studying the adsorption of the 6-MP(1,9) isomer to the Au(001) surface seems to be necessary. As shown in Figure 3, the adsorbed isomers
were named mb-1, mb-2, mb-3, mb-4, and mb-5. The selected geometric
parameters of adsorbed 6-MP isomers are also listed in Table 1, and the corresponding
adsorption energies with inclusion of the vdW correction are also
given in Table 2. As
shown in Figure 3,
the 6-MP(1,9) isomer can also adsorb onto the Au(001)
surface via two potential modes, monodentate for configurations mb-2, mb-3, and mb-4 and bridging
bidentate for mb-5. In these five configurations, the
most stable one is mb-5, with an adsorption energy of
−18.94 kcal/mol. In this configuration, 6-MP forms
a 30° tilting angle between the plane of the molecule and the
Au surface. The isomer 6-MP(1,9) is also bridged to the
Au surface atom via two S–Au bonds with distances of 2.58 and
2.62 Å. However, in configurations mb-2 and mb-3, the S–Au distances are 2.89 and 2.83 Å,
implying that the bonds are relatively weaker and in mb-4, the S–Au distance is 2.48 Å, indicating that a strong
bond is formed between the isomer and Au atom.

Two Isomers’ (6-MP(3,9) and 6-MP(3,7)) Adsorption Configurations
Both 6-MP(3,9) and 6-MP(3,7) are also two thione isomers. As seen from Figures 4 and 5, these adsorption configurations were named mc-1, mc-2, and mc-3 for 6-MP(3,9) configurations and md-1 and md-2 for 6-MP(3,7) configurations. The corresponding geometrical parameters
are also listed in Table 1. As seen from Table 1, in mc-2, a weak interaction between the S atom
and Au atoms are formed with distances of 3.26 and 3.46 Å. In mc-3, the S–Au bond is formed and the distance is 2.45
Å. The corresponding bond angle for C–S–Au is 122.1°.
In mc-1 and mc-2, the optimized geometries
retain an approximately vertical configuration with respect to the
Au surface. Each of them adopted a 90° orientation with respect
to the Au–Au bonds of the Au surface. Of particular interest
in this study was the bonding style for certain geometries in the
optimized adsorbate-cluster pairs. Table 3 shows that mc-3 is the most
stable one with the adsorption energy of −17.94 kcal/mol, followed
by mc-2 (−9.95 kcal/mol) with an energy difference
of 7.99 kcal/mol.

In 6-MP(3,7) adsorption configurations,
there are
two complexes md-1 and md-2. In md-1, the optimized geometries retain an approximately vertical configuration
with respect to the Au surface. In md-2, the S–Au
bond distance is 2.44 Å. The corresponding bond angle C–S–Au
is 120.7°. Table 3 shows that md-1 has an adsorption energy of −6.92
kcal/mol and compared with md-1, the adsorption energy
of md-2 is relatively lower by 10.19 kcal/mol at −17.11
kcal/mol, implying that configuration md-1 has relatively
low stability and md-2 has relatively high stability.
Moreover, the stability of md-2 is next to that of ma-2 (with an adsorption energy of −17.77 kcal/mol).

Thiol Isomers’ Adsorption on the Au (001) Surface
6-MP(7,10) Isomer Adsorption Configurations
In the thiol configurations, there are two main predominant isomers
for consideration, 6-MP(7, 10) and 6-MP(9, 10). Four configurations were considered for the adsoption of 6-MP(7, 10): me-1, me-2, me-3, and me-4. Similarly, four configurations were considered for the
adsorption of isomer 6-MP(9, 10): mf-1, mf-2, mf-3, and mf-4. They are given in Figures 6 and 7. From Figure 6, in the adsorbed complexes me-1, me-2, me-3, and me-4, the S atoms of the group −SH
in me-2 and me-4 link directly to the Au
surface with distances of 2.99 and 2.62 Å for the S–Au
bonds. In this case, the interaction in me-4 is stronger
than that in me-2. It is also determined that the angle
C–S–Au is 148.3 and 111.0° in me-2 and me-4 configurations, respectively (see Table 5). They belong to
classic monodentate bonds. However, in me-1 and me-3, it is the hydrogen atoms that interact weakly with the
Au atoms on the surface. Moreover in me-1, the distance
between the hydrogen atom and the Au atom is 3.35 Å, implying
relatively weak interaction. In me-3, the distance between
the hydrogen atom and Au atom is 2.52 Å, implying
relatively stronger interaction. In me-2, me-3 and me-4, the optimized geometries retain approximately vertical
configurations on the Au surface, similar to 6-MP(1,9) shown in Figure 3. In me-2, me-3, and me-4,
the molecule vertically adsorbed onto the Au surface and the only
one exception, in me-1, that the molecule is also reclining.
It is also shown from Table 4 that me-4 is the most stable configuration in
the thiol isomers with the adsorption energy of −5.09 kcal/mol
followed by me-3 with an energy difference of 0.78 kcal/mol
with the adsorption energy of −4.31 kcal/mol. Me-1 and me-2 were found to have higher relative energies
with adsorption energies of −3.85 and −3.58 kcal/mol,
leading to bond breakage of H–Au and S–Au bonds.

6-MP(9,10) Isomer Adsorption Configurations
From Figure 7, in
the adsorbed complexes of 6-MP(9,10), the S atoms of
the −SH group in mf-2 and mf-4 also
adsorbed directly to the Au surface with distances of 2.95 and 2.56
Å, respectively. According to Table 5, it is found that
in mf-2, the angle C–S–Au is 128.9°,
while it is 113.0° in mf-4. However, in mf-1 and mf-3, it is the hydrogen atom or nitrogen atom
that interacts with the Au atom of the Au surface. In mf-1, the shortest distance between 6-MP and the Au atom
is 3.65 Å, implying weak interaction only by long-range interactions;
however, in mf-3, the shortest distance is 2.47 Å
between the H atom and Au atom, and the second shortest distance is
3.10 Å between the N atom and Au atom, implying relatively strong
interaction. In mf-2, mf-3, and mf-4, the
molecule also adsorbed vertically to the Au surface, while in mf-1, the molecule is slightly tilted. As shown in Table 4, mf-4 is the most stable one with the adsorption energy of −5.06
kcal/mol, followed by mf-3 (−2.98 kcal/mol) with
an energy difference of 2.08 kcal/mol. mf-1 and mf-2 were also found to be unstable with smaller adsorption
energies of −2.07 and −2.53 kcal/mol, leading to bond
breakage of H–Au and S–Au bonds.

Comparison of Two Methods
To evaluate the precision
of the method used, we repeated the adsorption energy calculations
of 6-MP to the Au surface using the PW91-D3 functional
and then performed single-point calculations for the more stable configurations
using the vdW corrected functional of optPBE-vdW. The results of ma-2, ma-8, mb-5, and mc-3 are listed
in Table 3. When the
energies of these two methods (PW91-D3 and optPBE-D3) are compared,
it is found that the adsorption energies are slightly different because
a stronger binding between 6-MP and the Au surface is
suggested. After considering the vdW correction, it can be deduced
that the energy of ma-2 is increased to −16.30
kcal/mol from −17.77 kcal/mol by 1.47 kcal/mol and for md-8 increased to −16.24 kcal/mol from −17.11
kcal/mol by 0.87 kcal/mol. For mb-5, the energy is increased
to −17.50 kcal/mol from −18.94 kcal/mol by 1.44 kcal/mol.
For mc-3, the energy is increased to −16.60 kcal/mol
from −17.94 kcal/mol by 1.34 kcal/mol. Compared with the standard
PW91-D3 calculations, the PBE-D3 calculation results show a systematic
increase of the adsorption energies. Even though there are some differences
between them; however, it represents a slight proportion. Hence, in
this article, we use the PW91-D3 method for all of the energy considerations.

Charge Density Calculations
The results of charge density
difference isosurfaces for the four most stable adsorption configurations
are given in Figure 8. As can be seen from Figure 8, charge density difference isosurfaces show that the electronic
charge is accumulated between Au and S atoms in the Au–S bonds.
This behavior shows the stronger and more covalent character during
S–Au bond formation. The isosurfaces also show that the electronic
charges on ma-2 and mb-5 are more than those
on ma-8 and mc-3. This mainly resulted from
the differences between the double and single Au–S chemical
bonds. The isosurfaces also reveal that the electronic charges on ma-2 and mb-5 accumulated on the Au surfaces
and, moreover, the electronic charges on ma-2 accumulated
nearly twice for the S atom at the bridge site than that found on mb-5.

Figure 8 Charge density difference isosurfaces for the surface
models 6-MP
on Au(001). The yellow color shows electronic charge accumulation
and green depletion.

Since the 6-MP geometry with the S
atom in the bridge
position interacting with the gold substrate is energetically the
most favored configuration, one would expect that all of the molecules
should adsorb in this configuration similar to ma-2 and mb-5. However, this arrangement implies a large tilting (Figure 3a,b) and therefore
a smaller surface coverage than that obtained with less tilted configurations.

The Bader charge analyses for the Au–S, S–C, and
C–N bonds of the 6-MP molecules are also given
in Table 6. The results
indicate that the S and N atoms in ma-2 and mb-5 are negatively charged, while the S atoms in ma-8 and mc-3 are positively charged, and the N atoms are negatively
charged. However, all Au atoms are positively charged except for Au(1)
in mb-5 for which the partial charge is zero. This indicates
that charge is transferred from Au atoms to the S atoms and the chemical
bonds are indeed formed. The charges from the N to S atoms are much
larger than that found from the Au to the S atoms. These results are
similar to those found for the 6-MP molecules on the
Au(111) and Au(100) surface.6 All of the
results show that the charge transfer in ma-2 is dramatic
in all of the complexes because of double-bond formation. In Table 7, the bond orders
of the Au–S bond for four complexes ma-2, ma-8, mb-5, and mc-3 are also given, and from the data, we can
conclude that in ma-8 and mc-3, the S–Au bond is relatively
stronger because of the larger bond orders, and for ma-2 and mb-5,
it is relatively weaker. But, it shows that the chemical bonds are
formed for these four configurations.

To further obtain information about the interaction
of 6-MP isomers adsorbed on the Au(001) surface in detail,
the density of
states (DOS) has also been investigated for four configurations ma-2, ma-8, mb-5, and mc-3. Total
density of states (TDOS) is given in Figure 9, in which the two figures at the bottom
are for a clean Au surface and an isolated 6-MP. As seen
from the changes of TDOS plots, one can conclude that for the Au(001)
surface, 6-MP adsorption configurations exhibit a similar
electronic state distribution for the reason that their types of surface
atom sites are equivalent. Four Au surfaces are sensitive to 6-MP molecule adsorption. In other words, the adsorbed molecules
expose an important influence on the electronic properties of Au(001)
clean surfaces. However, for the S atom of the 6-MP molecule,
the TDOS peaks have moved to a lower energy and remain slightly far
from the Fermi level compared to those of the isolated 6-MP molecule. Turning to the Au(001) surface, the TDOS main peaks have
moved to a higher energy and remain close to the Fermi level compared
to those of the clean surface before adsorption. The intrinsic bonding
mechanism for 6-MP molecule adsorption on Au(001) surfaces
can be obtained by analyzing the PDOS in the adsorbed systems. Thus,
the existence of a covalent bond between 6-MP and Au(001)
surfaces is understandable.

Computational Details
Density functional theory (DFT)
calculations were performed using
the VASP 5.2.2 program.18,19 Two functionals, PW91
and Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE), were employed. To
correctly account for van der Waals (vdW) interactions, we used the
DFT-D3 method with Becke–Johnson (BJ) damping.20,21 This combination of the functional and dispersion correction has
been shown by Goerigk and Grimme22 to provide
a very robust description of vdW effects in comparison with other
GGA-based formulations. The projector augmented plane wave (PAW) method
has been used to represent the atomic cores with the PBE potential.23 The energy cut off was set to be 450 eV. A 5
× 5 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack24 k-point mesh per unit cell was used. The Au(001) substrates were
represented by a five atomic layer and a vacuum of about ∼17
Å that separates two successive slabs. Surface relaxation is
allowed in the three uppermost Au layers of the slab, and the atomic
coordinates of the adsorbed species were allowed to relax without
further constraints. To prepare the 6-MP-Au(001) complexes,
the adsorbates are placed on just one side of the slab at different
initial configurations. Radical 6-MP species were optimized
in an asymmetric box of 20 × 20° × 40 Å. The calculated
Au lattice constant is 4.16 Å, which is in good agreement with
the experimental value (4.078 or 4.080 Å).25−27 One 6-MP molecule was placed on the surface of the 3 × 3 supercell to
eliminate the interaction of neighboring molecules. The average binding
energy per adsorbed 6-MP species on Au(001) surfaces, Eb, is defined in the following equation: 1  in which E(6-MP/Au), E(Au), and E(6-MP) are the total electronic energies of the adsorbed 6-MP on a Au(001) surface, a bare Au(001) surface, and a 6-MP molecule in a vacuum, respectively. If this value is a negative
number, the adsorption is exothermic.

A more negative Eb value also indicates
stronger (exothermic) adsorption. The most stable complexes were reoptimized
using the PBE-D3 method. The geometries and absorption energies were
found not to be sensitive to the choice of the functional according
to our results (See Table 2 in the next Section).

Conclusions
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
were performed for
the adsorption of different isomers for 6-mercaptopurine on the Au(001)
surface. Two functionals, PW91 and Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE), were employed. To correctly account for van der Waals (vdW)
interactions, we used the DFT-D3 method with Becke–Johnson
(BJ) damping. All of the configurations of four thione and two thiol
isomers were considered. The results show that the adsorption of thione
isomers is much stronger than that of thiol isomers. In all of the
configurations, the binding energy of ma-8 is the largest,
in which the S atom of 6-mercaptopurine binds strongly with one Au
atom on the monodentate sites and 6-mercaptopurine retains a flat
geometry, predominantly with about a 30° orientation between
the C–S bond of 6-mercaptopurine and the Au–Au bond
of the catalyst. Additionally, the 6-mercaptopurines in ma-2, mb-5, and mc-3 also bind more strongly
to the surface and they show relatively higher stability on the surfaces,
indicating a high preference for adsorption of these forms. Charge
density difference analysis also shows that the electronic charges
are accumulated between Au and S atoms in the Au–S bonds.
