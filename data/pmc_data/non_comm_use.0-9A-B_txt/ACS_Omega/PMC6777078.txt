A new
visible-light-responsive tetrahedral ultrathin metal–organic
framework nanosheet (UMOFNs)/Ag3PO4 composite
photocatalyst with a core–shell structure was readily synthesized
by sonication in an organic solvent. Characterization methods for
the photocatalyst included X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron
microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and UV–vis diffuse
reflectance spectroscopy. The XRD patterns of the composite photocatalyst
before and after visible-light irradiation demonstrated that trace
amounts of Ag ions in the composite photocatalyst easily transformed
into Ag nanoparticles, which play a role in promoting charge separation
at the interface of a heterojunction. The UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 composite photocatalyst showed higher photocatalytic activity
for the photodegradation of 2-chlorophenol (2-CP) under visible-light
irradiation (>420 nm) than Ag3PO4. The complete
degradation of 2-CP was achieved in 7 min using the tetrahedral UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 core–shell photocatalyst, and the apparent
reaction rate was approximately 26 times higher than that of pure
Ag3PO4. Further, a scavenger experiment showed
h+ and O2•– were the
major reactive species involved in the photocatalytic reaction system.
This enhanced photocatalytic activity results from the efficient separation
of photoinduced electron–hole pairs and the increase of interface
area between Ag3PO4, UMOFNs, and the Ag nanoparticles.

1 Introduction
Photocatalytic
reaction systems are one of the most promising purification
technologies used to address environmental problems. That is because
they can degrade various organic pollutants using solar energy in
a variety of environments.1,2 Conventional photocatalysts,
including TiO2, ZnO, and SrTiO3, are photocatalytically
reactive only under UV light irradiation. However, UV light is less
than 4% of solar energy and it is therefore impossible to bring out
sufficient photocatalytic performance under solar energy, limiting
their practical application in many environments. For this reason,
there has been significant interest in efficient visible-light-responsive
photocatalysts for utilizing the full spectrum of solar energy.

In the field of photocatalysts, metal–organic frameworks
(MOFs), which are composed of metal clusters and organic ligands,
have received considerable attention in recent years as promising
porous photocatalysts.3−5 They provide a variety of excellent properties, including
large surface area, adjustable functions, and high porosity. They
also have been widely utilized in catalysis, separation, gas storage,
chemical sensors, and biomedicine because of the various outstanding
properties of porous materials.6−18 In recent years, worldwide attention has increasingly been drawn
to applying MOFs to photocatalysts. Various MOFs have been introduced
as semiconductor materials and used as photocatalysts under UV light,
including MOF-5,19 MIL-125,20 UIO-66,21 MIL-53,22 MOF-253,23 and MIL-100.24 However, these MOFs have the drawbacks of absorbing
only short-wavelength light in the UV range, as well as low effective
separation of photoinduced charge carriers because of a wide-band
gap and a fast recombination rate of electron–hole pairs. Furthermore,
most of these MOFs are unstable in water because water molecules change
the metal–organic coordination bond to a metal–water
coordination bond. It is therefore recommended to introduce other
highly conductive, visible-light-responsive and mechanically stable
materials as photocatalysts to solve the above drawbacks of MOFs.25

To construct composite materials with
heterojunction systems, studies
have combined MOFs with various semiconductor materials, including
TiO2,26 g-C3N4,27 and GrO.28 Heterojunction semiconductor-based MOFs showed superior
photocatalytic performance and stability compared with single components
because of the efficient separation of photoinduced charge carriers
at the hetero-interface between the MOFs and other semiconductor materials.
Specifically, Li et al. reported that TiO2 encapsulated
in salicylaldehyde-NH2-MIL-101(Cr) has superior photocatalytic
performance for MB degradation under visible-light irradiation.26 Yang et al. demonstrated that MIL-68-(In)-NH2 combined with GrO showed superior electron transport properties,
leading to enhanced photocatalytic activity for the visible-light-driven
photocatalytic degradation of amoxicillin.28 Chen et al. prepared CdS/g-C3N4/MIL-125(Ti)
via a facial solvothermal method, which has excellent photocatalytic
performance owing to the formation of an interface between CdS, g-C3N4, and MIL-125(Ti).29 However, it is still necessary to develop new photocatalysts because
the above MOF-based composite photocatalysts have insufficient photocatalytic
performance for practical use.

Ultrathin MOF nanosheets (UMOFNs),
which are composed of terephthalic
acid (H2BDC) as an organic ligand and Ni2+ and
Co2+ as central metals, have attracted significant attention
in the field of photocatalysts as two-dimensional structural materials.30 UMOFNs with a two-dimensional structure have
many superior properties compared with three-dimensional structural
materials. For example, the charge transfer in ultrathin nanosheets
is so fast that efficient charge separation is facilitated and there
are many exposed active sites with unsaturated metals. In addition,
combining UMOFNs with other semiconductors provides a large interface
area at the heterojunction between the UMOFNs and the other semiconductor
materials, improving the photocatalytic activity of the semiconductor
materials. These advantages make two-dimensional UMOFNs promising
materials for practical application in the field of photocatalysts.

In recent years, silver-based photocatalysts, such as AgVO3, Ag2CO3, Ag2O, AgBr, and
Ag3PO4, have been widely reported as promising
environmental purification technologies. Ag3PO4 in particular shows superior photocatalytic performance for the
degradation of organic contaminants under visible-light irradiation
as a result of the narrow band gap and high oxidizability of the photoinduced
hole. Furthermore, the photocatalytic performance of Ag3PO4 can be enhanced by controlling the shape, morphology,
and crystal plane during preparation.31−34 However, the Ag ions in Ag3PO4 are easily changed to Ag metal by photocorrosion
of Ag3PO4 under light irradiation. An excessive
amount of these Ag metal particles interferes with charge transfer,
light adsorption, and contact with organic contaminants on Ag3PO4. As a result of these factors, photocorrosion
gradually degrades the structure and photocatalytic activity of Ag3PO4 in the process of the photocatalytic reaction,
hindering the practical application of Ag3PO4 in environmental purification technologies. Therefore, to effectively
separate photoinduced electrons on Ag3PO4 and
thereby prevent its photocorrosion, researchers all over the world
have developed hybrid composite photocatalysts based on Ag3PO4, including MoSe2/Ag3PO4,35 g-C3N4/Ag3PO436 Ag3PO4/TiO2,37 Ag3PO4/Fe3O4,38 Ag3PO4/SnO2,39 and GO/Ag3PO4.40 These catalysts show superior photocatalytic
performance and stability compared with pure Ag3PO4. Similarly, the incorporation of MOFs into Ag3PO4 is also a reasonable approach for improving photocatalytic
activity and stability. For example, Ag3PO4/UMOFNs,41 Ag3PO4/BiPO4/Cu terephthalic acid,42 Ag3PO4/UIO-66,43 Ag-Ag3PO4/HKUST-1,44 Ag3PO4/MIL-101/NiFe2O4,45 Ag3PO4/NH2-MIL-125,46 and Ag3PO4/MIL-53(Fe)47 have been reported. However, these studies provided
limited information with regard to hybrid composite photocatalysts
combining MOFs and Ag3PO4.

To further
improve photocatalytic performance by the modification
of surface properties, photocatalysts with exposed highly reactive
crystal faces have received considerable attention. For the Ag3PO4 photocatalysts, the surface energies of {111},
{110}, and {100} planes were calculated by Martin et al., who found
that {111} planes have the highest surface energy.48 Furthermore, this result was consistent with the photocatalytic
results. On the basis of the above information, the photocatalytic
activity of Ag3PO4 can be remarkably enhanced
by the synergy of controlling the exposed crystal faces and introducing
UMOFNs. Although studies on UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 composite
photocatalysts have already been reported,41 they had insufficient photocatalytic performance for practical use.

To address these issues, in this paper, we report a new visible-light-responsive
tetrahedral UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 composite photocatalyst
with a {111} plane core–shell structure for improved photocatalytic
performance. UMOFNs/Ag3PO4, in which UMOFNs
and Ag3PO4 were the shell and core, respectively,
was readily synthesized by sonication in an organic solvent. Further,
to the best our knowledge, there are few reports on the synthesis
of the tetrahedral UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 composite photocatalyst
with core–shell structure and its photocatalytic activity.
The composite is expected to have significantly improved photocatalytic
performance over that of other photocatalysts. The photocatalytic
activity of the tetrahedral UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 core–shell
photocatalyst was evaluated by the photodegradation of 2-chlorophenol
(2-CP) under visible-light irradiation (>420 nm). In addition,
we
also present the photocatalytic mechanism of 2-CP degradation by UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 under visible light. The findings in this study
will provide feasible routes to fabricate tetrahedral UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 composites with highly efficient photocatalytic
activity for environmental applications.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Characterization
X-ray diffraction
(XRD) was employed to confirm the crystal structure of the photocatalytic
materials. Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of UMOFNs, Ag3PO4,
and UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 (5 wt %). The XRD patterns
of Ag3PO4 show that the crystalline phase is
body-centered cubic (JCPDS No. 06-0505). Furthermore, it shows narrow
and sharp peaks, confirming that the microcrystals of Ag3PO4 contain no impurities and have a high degree of crystallization.
The XRD pattern of the UMOFNs was consistent with that of a previous
work,41 indicating that the UMOFNs were
successfully fabricated. In the UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 composite photocatalyst, the characteristic peak attributed to Ag3PO4 remained after combination with UMOFNs while
the UMOFNs peaks were not seen owing to the weak diffraction intensity
and the low amount of UMOFNs in the composite photocatalysts. Furthermore,
there are no additional peaks in the composite photocatalyst, which
indicates the crystal structure of Ag3PO4 was
not altered during fabrication of the composite photocatalysts. The
XRD patterns of the composite photocatalysts with various mass ratios
of UMOFNs (1, 5, and 10%) are shown in Figure S1. No differences were found among the diffraction patterns
of the photocatalysts with various contents of UMOFNs. These results
can also be attributed to the weak diffraction intensity and low amounts
of UMOFNs.

Figure 1 XRD patterns of Ag3PO4, UMOFNs, and UMOFNs/Ag3PO4.

To confirm the morphology
of the photocatalytic materials, UMOFNs,
Ag3PO4, and UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 composite photocatalysts were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). These results are
shown in Figure 2. Figure 2a,b shows that the
Ag3PO4 particles have a tetrahedral morphology
and are about 0.5–2.0 μm in size, indicating Ag3PO4 with {111} facets was successfully prepared by the
kinetic control method. The {111} planes of Ag3PO4 have higher energy than other planes, which leads to enhanced photocatalytic
activity.48 It can be clearly seen in Figure 2c,d that the UMOFNs
possess an ultrathin two-dimensional nanosheet structure with a slightly
rolled edge. The morphology of the UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 composite photocatalyst can be seen in Figure 2e,f. The two-dimensional UMOFNs primarily
wrap the surface of the tetrahedral Ag3PO4 particles,
suggesting the formation of a core–shell structure. The core–shell
structure of UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 can promote the efficient
separation of photoinduced charge carriers, owing to a large contact
area at the interface between the UMOFNs shell and Ag3PO4 core.41

D) UMOFNs, and (E, F) UMOFNs/Ag3PO4.

To investigate the porosity and specific surface area of
Ag3PO4, UMOFNs, and the UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 composites, we measured the nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms. Figures 3 and S2 show the nitrogen sorption isotherms
and the pore size distribution of UMOFNs/Ag3PO4, UMOFNs, and Ag3PO4. It can be clearly seen
in Figure 3 that UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 exhibits a type IV isotherm according to the
IUPAC classification, indicating UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 has mesopores with a microporous structure. In addition, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
surface area of the UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 composite
photocatalyst is 1.60 m2 g–1 while that
of Ag3PO4 is 0.78 m2 g–1.

The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of UMOFNs, Ag3PO4, and UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 with
various mass ratios of UMOFNs (1, 5, and 10%) can be seen in Figure 4. For the pristine
UMOFNs, the two characteristic peaks located at 1647 and 1370 cm–1 are attributed to the asymmetric stretching vibration
and symmetric stretching vibration, respectively, of the carboxyl
group in the terephthalic acid.41 The two
peaks from 1000 to 1250 cm–1 in the UMOFNs resulted
from the C–N stretching vibration of DMF, which could not be
removed during preparation of the UMOFNs. The peak around 600–800
cm–1 is due to the vibration of Co–O and
Ni–O bonds in the UMOFNs.41 In the
FTIR spectra of Ag3PO4, the two strong peaks
located at 539 and 923 cm–1 were derived from the
P–O stretching vibration in PO43–.49 In comparison with the IR spectra
of Ag3PO4, UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 has three prominent peaks at 748, 1370, and 1647 cm–1, which are derived from the UMOFNs. In addition, with a gradual
increase of UMOFNs content, the intensities of the UMOFNs peaks are
strengthened in the IR spectrum of UMOFNs/Ag3PO4. These results imply that there is a weak interaction between the
UMOFNs shell and Ag3PO4 core41 and also suggests the successful formation of a heterojunction
in the core–shell composite photocatalyst.

mass ratios of UMOFNs (1, 5, and 10%).

The UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–vis
DRS) of the materials were obtained to investigate the photocatalytic
mechanism and optical characteristics and can be seen in Figure 5a. Ag3PO4 has an adsorption edge at 510 nm, indicating that
it is a visible-light-responsive photocatalyst that can efficiently
absorb light energy. It can also be clearly seen that UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 has much higher light absorption compared with
Ag3PO4. Moreover, the band gaps (Eg) of Ag3PO4 and UMOFNs were calculated
on the basis of the Kubelka–Munk formula described below  where α, h, ν,
and A are the absorption coefficient, Planck constant,
light frequency, and constant, respectively. The value of n is varied according to the transition type; that is, the n value is 1 for direct transition and 4 for an indirect
one, respectively. In this formula, the value of n was 1 because Ag3PO4 and UMOFNs are direct
transition semiconductors.38,50 As shown in Figure 5b, the band gap energies
(Eg) of Ag3PO4 and
UMOFNs can be estimated on the basis of the Tauc plot of (αhν)2 vs hν and were
calculated to be 2.46 and 3.01 eV, respectively. In addition, the
valance band edges (EVB) of Ag3PO4 and UMOFNs were measured by valence bond X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (VBXPS) (Figure S3). It can
be clearly seen in Figure S3 that the EVB values for Ag3PO4 and
UMOFNs were 2.65 and 1.59 V (vs normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)),
respectively. From the above results, their conduction band edges
(ECB) were calculated to be 0.19 and −1.41
V (vs NHE), respectively, according to the following equation  The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra
of the photocatalysts using excitation light of 360 nm were analyzed
to confirm the recombination rate of the electron–hole pairs,
as shown in Figure 6. UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 shows a lower PL intensity
than Ag3PO4, which indicates that the charge
separation was promoted effectively; that is, the recombination of
the photoinduced electron–hole pairs was suppressed after the
introduction of UMOFNs.2 Furthermore, these
results confirm that the heterojunction interface was successfully
constructed between the UMOFNs and Ag3PO4 because
their suitable band positions could easily migrate photoinduced charge
carriers at the hetero-interface.

The chemical composition of UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 was
evaluated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. Figure 7a gives the XPS survey
spectrum of UMOFNs/Ag3PO4, which indicates UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 is composed of C, O, P, Ni, Co, and Ag. In
addition, no peaks for other elements were observed, confirming UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 was of high purity. In Figure 7b, the C 1s spectrum of the composite photocatalyst
has two peaks located at 284.5 and 288.1 eV. The strong peak at 284.5
eV corresponds to C=C for aromatic hydrocarbons, while the
small peak at 288.1 eV is associated with the C–O in carbonate
species.51Figure 7c shows the O 1s peak of the composite photocatalyst
at 531.2 eV is associated with the Ni–O bond, Co–O bond,
or hydroxyl oxygen.51Figure 7d displays the P 2p spectrum
of the composite photocatalyst, which is associated with the phosphorus
from PO43–.2 In Figure 7e, the
Co 2p spectrum gives two main peaks at 781.2 and 785.2 eV. The former
is associated with Co 2p3/2, while the latter corresponds
to the shakeup satellite peak, indicative of the presence of Co2+. It can be seen in Figure 7f that the composite photocatalyst showed two Ni 2p
peaks located at 856.3 and 861.8 eV, which were attributed to the
characteristic peak of Ni2+ (Ni 2p3/2) and its
shakeup satellite peak, respectively. As shown in Figure 7g, the two peaks located at
367.9 and 373.9 eV were assigned to Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2, indicating the presence of Ag+ in the composite
photocatalyst.2

2.2 Photocatalytic
Activity of UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 Core–Shell
Photocatalysts
The photocatalytic
performance of the prepared photocatalysts was examined by measuring
the degradation efficiency of 2-CP under visible light (Figures 8 and S4) and the apparent reaction rates (kapp) were obtained using pseudo-first-order rate equations (Figure S5). Figure S4 shows the photocatalytic degradation of 2-CP over UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 composite photocatalysts with different amounts
of UMOFNs (1, 5, 10, 20, and 30%). Among the composite photocatalysts,
UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 (5 wt %) showed the best photocatalytic
performance. Hence, 5 wt % of UMOFNs content was selected as the optimal
amount. As shown in Figure 8, 2-CP hardly deteriorated under visible-light irradiation
without photocatalysts, which confirms any self-degradation of 2-CP
could be neglected during the experiment. The tetrahedral Ag3PO4 with {111} facet showed higher photocatalytic performance
than Ag3PO4 irregular spheres owing to the exposure
of the {111} facet having high surface energy.48 Among the photocatalytic materials, tetrahedral UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 composite photocatalysts showed the best photocatalytic
performance and complete degradation of 2-CP was achieved in only
7 min. The excellent photocatalytic performance resulted from the
efficient separation of charge carriers and the large contact area
at the hetero-interface between UMOFNs, Ag3PO4, and the Ag nanoparticles.41 In contrast,
M-UMOFNs/Ag3PO4, prepared by mechanically mixing
UMOFNs and Ag3PO4, exhibited lower photocatalytic
performance compared with UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 core–shell
photocatalysts prepared by sonication in an organic solvent. This
further confirms that the formation of a core–shell structure
occurred via an UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 chemical mixture
rather than a physical mixture, leading to the efficient separation
of photoinduced electron–hole pairs at the hetero-interface
between the UMOFNs shell and Ag3PO4 core. UMOFNs
were also unable to degrade 2-CP under visible-light irradiation.
The kapp of 2-CP for various photocatalysts
was calculated from the pseudo-first-order rate equations, according
to the following equation  where C0 and Ct are the concentration of 2-CP before and after
irradiation for t min, respectively. The kapp values of the Ag3PO4 spheres, Ag3PO4 tetrahedrons, UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 spheres, and UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 tetrahedrons were calculated as 0.026, 0.262, 0.047, and 0.782 min–1, respectively. The kapp for the UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 tetrahedrons was approximately
26 times higher than that of Ag3PO4 spheres.

Figure 8 Photocatalytic
degradation of 2-CP with various photocatalysts.

The removal of total organic carbon (TOC) in the reaction system
was analyzed to evaluate the photocatalytic mineralization abilities
of Ag3PO4 and UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 (Figure S6). After visible-light irradiation
for 120 min, the TOC removal percent reached 22.1 and 69.8% in the
presence of Ag3PO4 and UMOFNs/Ag3PO4, respectively. This result indicates that the photocatalytic
mineralization performance of UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 was
higher than that of Ag3PO4, which is good agreement
with the photocatalytic degradation results as described above.

It is known that the long stability of photocatalyst plays an important
role in its practical application. Therefore, we conducted the cycle
experiments using Ag3PO4 and UMOFNs/Ag3PO4, as shown in Figure 9. After three cycles, the photocatalytic performance
of UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 remained at a high level, while
that of Ag3PO4 significantly deteriorated. This
result reflects the efficient charge separation at the hetero-interface;
that is, the photoinduced electrons and holes effectively migrate
to the surface of the composite, preventing the photocorrosion in
the photocatalyst.44

degradation with Ag3PO4 and UMOFNs/Ag3PO4.

2.3 Photocatalytic
Mechanism of UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 Core–Shell
Photocatalysts
To
further confirm the photocatalytic mechanism of 2-CP degradation by
UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 under visible-light irradiation,
the main reactive species was examined by using radical scavenging
effects in the same way as the photocatalytic experiments (Figure 10). Ammonium oxalate
(AO), t-butyl alcohol (TBA), and p-benzoquinone (BQ) were used in the photocatalytic degradation system
to quench h+, •OH, and O2•–, respectively. As seen in Figure 10, the degradation rate was
hardly affected after the addition of TBA to the reaction solution.
In contrast, the addition of BQ and AO suppressed the photocatalytic
degradation of 2-CP. These results suggest that h+ and
O2•– were the major reactive species
involved in the photocatalytic degradation of 2-CP by UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 under visible-light irradiation.

Figure 10 Photocatalytic
activities of UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 (5 wt %) photocatalyst
on the photodegradation of 2-chlorophenol
under visible-light irradiation in the presence of different scavengers.

XRD patterns, PL spectra, and DRS of the photocatalysts
before
and after visible-light irradiation were examined to further support
the mechanism of photocatalytic reaction for 2-CP degradation (Figure S7). In Figure S7a, peaks assigned to Ag0 at 38.2, 42.5, and 61.4°
were observed in the used photocatalysts, indicating Ag+ was reduced to Ag0 during the photocatalytic reaction.
Trace amounts of Ag0 in UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 composite photocatalyst play the role of electron trapping centers,
which suppresses recombination of the photogenerated electron and
hole in the photocatalytic reaction.2,52 On the other
hand, an excessive amount of Ag metal particles can be found in pure
Ag3PO4 after visible-light irradiation, which
interferes with charge transfer, light adsorption, and contact with
organic contaminants on Ag3PO4.50,53 These results also suggest that the formation of UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 composite leads to the effective transfer of photoinduced
electrons on Ag3PO4 to UMOFNs and prevents excessive
Ag reduction. As seen in Figure S7b, the
recycled UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 photocatalyst shows much
higher light adsorption in the visible region (400–800 nm)
owing to the surface plasmonic resonance (SPR) effect of Ag nanoparticles.54 The PL emission intensity of the recycled UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 photocatalyst was lower than that of the fresh
one (Figure S7c), indicating that charge
separation was effectively promoted during the photocatalytic process
because the trace amount of Ag0 nanoparticles acts as a
charge separation center.54 The results
obtained from these experiments explain that trace amounts of Ag0 were deposited in UMOFN/Ag3PO4 composite
during the photocatalytic reaction, which can play roles of a photosensitizer
and charge separation center.

From the above results, a possible
mechanism of the photodegradation
of 2-CP by UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 under visible irradiation
is shown in Figure 11. In the early stage of the photocatalytic process, Ag ions in UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 are reduced to Ag0 nanoparticles
from photocorrosion of Ag3PO4 under visible-light
irradiation. The trace amounts of Ag0 nanoparticles in
the composite photocatalyst can act as a charge separation center,
leading to the effective separation of photoinduced charge carriers
at the interface between Ag3PO4 and UMOFNs.2 In the presence of visible light, Ag3PO4 can be activated when absorbing energy greater than
the band gap of Ag3PO4, resulting in photoinduced
holes and electrons in the valence band (VB) and the conduction band
(CB), respectively. In addition, Ag0 nanoparticles also
can be activated under visible-light irradiation through the SPR effect,
resulting in the formation of electron–hole pairs.54 The photoelectrons in the Ag3PO4 are easily transferred to Ag0 nanoparticles and
then recombine with the SPR-induced holes on Ag0 nanoparticles.55,56 As a result, the photocorrosion is prevented by the translation
of electrons from the CB of Ag3PO4 to Ag0 nanoparticles, leading to the improved stability of the composite
photocatalyst. On the other hand, the SPR-induced electrons on the
Ag0 nanoparticles migrate to the CB of UMOFNs to reduce
from O2 to O2•– because
the potential of CB of UMOFNs is high enough to produce O2•–. These reactive species exhibit a high
oxidation power to degrade 2-CP. In contrast, the holes left on the
VB of Ag3PO4 directly oxidize 2-CP because of
the inductive effect of the PO43– group
and the high positive potential of the VB.2 The effective charge separation could be achieved in this reaction
system under visible-light irradiation by the photocatalytic mechanism
described above.

3 Conclusions
A highly efficient visible-light-responsive
UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 core–shell photocatalyst
was successfully fabricated
by sonication in an organic solvent. During the photocatalytic reaction,
trace amounts of Ag nanoparticles were formed at the interface between
the UMOFNs and Ag3PO4. These nanoparticles act
as a charge separation center, leading to the efficient separation
of the photoinduced charge carriers. The photocatalytic performance
of UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 was much higher than that of
pure Ag3PO4 under visible-light irradiation
because of the highly reactive facets of the Ag3PO4 tetrahedrons and the core–shell structure with a large
interface area between UMOFNs, Ag3PO4, and Ag0. These results in this study show that the UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 core–shell photocatalyst has great potential
for practical application in environmental purification technology.

were prepared by a kinetic control method.48 First, AgNO3 (12 mmol) was dissolved in ethanol (80 mL)
using ultrasound. After AgNO3 completely dissolved, H3PO4 (20 mL) was also mixed with ethanol (80 mL)
and then the H3PO4 solution was added to the
AgNO3 solution and sonicated for 1 h in the darkness. The
resulting light-yellow product was collected by centrifugation, washed
with ethanol four times, and desiccated to obtain the Ag3PO4 tetrahedrons. To evaluate the effect of morphology
on photocatalytic performance, Ag3PO4 spheres
were also prepared by a facile precipitation method.57 First, AgNO3 (0.8 mmol) was dissolved in water
(10 mL) using ultrasound. Then, Na2HPO4 (1.0
mmol) was also dissolved in water (20 mL), and then the Na2HPO4 solution and AgNO3 solution were combined
and magnetically stirred for 3 h in the darkness. The resulting yellow
product was collected, washed four times with ethanol, and desiccated
to obtain the Ag3PO4 spheres.

UMOFNs were
prepared according to a previous report:30 H2BDC (0.75 mmol) was added to a mixed solution of N,N-dimethylformamide (32 mL), ethanol
(2 mL), and distilled water (2 mL) and thoroughly dissolved under
ultrasonication. Next, CoCl2·6H2O (0.375
mmol) and NiCl2·6H2O (0.375 mmol) were
added to the above solution. Then, triethylamine (0.8 mL) was quickly
added dropwise to the solution and sonicated for 8 h under airtight
condition. Finally, the obtained product was collected, washed with
ethanol four times, and desiccated using a vacuum dryer.

The
UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 core–shell photocatalysts
were fabricated by sonication in an organic solvent. The prepared
Ag3PO4 tetrahedrons were mixed with a solution
of the desired amount of UMOFNs in tetrahydrofuran (100 mL).The mixture
was then perfectly dispersed using ultrasound for 30 min. After dispersing,
the reaction mixture was sonicated in the darkness for 6 h. The obtained
product was collected by centrifugation, washed with ethanol four
times, and desiccated to get the UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 core–shell photocatalysts. UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 composite photocatalysts with different amounts of UMOFNs were also
fabricated following the same method.

4.2 Characterization
of Photocatalyst
A powder X-ray diffractometer (RIGAKU Ultima
IV, sample horizontal
type) equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source was used to measure
the XRD patterns of the materials. The morphologies and particle sizes
of the samples were analyzed by a Hitachi S-4000 SEM and a JEOL JEM-1011
TEM. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements were carried
out using a BEL-SORP-miniII (BEL, Japan) apparatus. A Spectrum 100
FTIR spectrometer (Perkin Elmer) equipped with an attenuated total
reflection assembly was used to record the FTIR spectra of the photocatalysts.
XPS analysis was performed on a PHI Quantera SXM photoelectron spectrometer
with an Al Kα radiation source. The DRS of the photocatalysts
were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer equipped
with an integral sphere assembly. PL spectra of the photocatalysts
were acquired by a Shimadzu RF-5300PC system with an excitation wavelength
of 360 nm. The changes for TOC of the 2-CP solution were analyzed
using a TOC-VE analyzer (Shimadzu, Japan).

4.3 Photocatalytic
Degradation Activity
To evaluate the photocatalytic performance
of the photocatalysts,
photodegradation of 2-CP was performed under visible-light irradiation
(λ > 420 nm). The photocatalyst (30 mg) was added to 35 mL
of
aqueous 2-CP solution (30 mg/L) in a 50 mL Pyrex glass cell. Before
irradiation, the 2-CP solution containing the photocatalyst was magnetically
stirred for 30 min in the dark to reach an adsorption–desorption
equilibrium between the photocatalyst and 2-CP. Then, the reaction
solution was irradiated by a 300 W Xe lamp (MAX-303, Asahi Spectra)
combined with a UV cut filter (L-42, HOYA). During the experiment,
2 mL aliquots were sampled from the reaction solution at specified
intervals and centrifuged to remove the photocatalyst particles. The
obtained solution was used to determine the concentration of residual
2-CPP by high-performance liquid chromatography with a TSKgel ODS-100V
column (internal diameter of 150 × 4.6 mm2, TOSOH)
and a GL-7450 UV detector (GL Science). An acetonitrile aqueous solution
(water/acetonitrile = 50:50 v/v) was used for the mobile phase. The
flow velocity was 1.0 mL/min, and the detector wavelength was 273
nm. For radical trapping experiments, various quenchers of reactive
species were added to the reaction solution in a manner similar to
the above photocatalytic experiment. The amounts of scavengers used
were determined according to a previous work.49
