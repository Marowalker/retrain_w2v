Polysaccharides represent a main
weight fraction of the intraskeletal
organic matrix of corals, but their structure, as well as their function
in the calcification process, has been poorly investigated. This communication
shows by a combination of techniques (nuclear magnetic resonance,
Fourier transform infrared, and monosaccharide composition) that their
key component is a 1→3 β-d glucuronic acid polymer
and evidences its influence in vitro in the calcification process.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
key component of biominerals is the organic matrix (OM), which
is involved in the control of nucleation, growth, form, and function
of the mineral phase.1 In stony corals,
OM is synthesized by cells of the calicoblastic epithelium and then
secreted into the adjacent subepithelial space in which calcification
takes place.2,3 The OM is formed by a mixture
of macromolecules (proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids) that share
some common chemical features through diverse coral genus.4,5 The structural and functional relationship between OM and mineral
phases in scleractinian coral skeleton only recently has started to
be understood at the molecular level, for what regards the proteic
moieties.6−12 These proteins, as many others associated with biominerals,1 are characterized by the presence of high mol
% (around 40 mol %) of acidic residues.6,7,11,12

Polysaccharides
represent a relevant mass fraction of the OM in
corals,5,11,13 but their
function in the crystallization process is not known. In mollusks,
chitin has been commonly observed to build an insoluble three-dimensional
scaffold in which the acid proteins adsorb, establishing a confined
mineralizing space.14,15 This polysaccharide is not common
in corals OM, and its presence has been reported only in some species.16,17 In coccolithopores, three families of polysaccharides interact directly
with the CaCO3. Indeed, it was demonstrated that polysaccharides
replace the water molecules that form hydrogen bonds with the surface
of the growing crystals.18 That polysaccharides
shield cation and anion trafficking to the crystals’ surfaces
inhibiting their growth.19

Usually,
OM polysaccharides (pscOMs) bear sulfate groups20 that cooperate with the carboxylates one to
induce CaCO3 nucleation.21,22 For instance,
the investigation on the effects of carbohydrate additives during
the early stages of CaCO3 precipitation revealed a variety
of interaction between these additives and CaCO3 species,
such as the complexation of Ca2+, the influence on the
stability of solute prenucleation clusters, and the inhibition or
promotion of nucleation.23 Giuffre et al.
quantified the kinetics of calcite nucleation onto different polysaccharide
substrates showing that polysaccharides with varying charge density,
together with local supersaturation, regulate the mineral nucleation
rate and density.24 Glycosaminoglycans
and proteoglycans are also involved in biomineralization.22 For example, in chicken eggs, they control the
morphology, the strength, and the thickness of the shells,25 and in crayfish gastrolith, they are closely
associated with the inorganic mineral phase.26

Here, it is reported as the characterization of a fraction
of pscOM
from coral skeletons and the study of its influence on in vitro CaCO3 precipitation. pscOM was obtained from the coral species, Astroides calycularis (Aca), Balanophyllia
europaea (Beu), and Stylophora pistillata (Spi), which are representatives of diverse trophic strategies and
growth forms.11

2 Results
and Discussion
pscOM was obtained by the mild alkaline digestion
at room temperature
of the whole intraskeletal OM (wOM, that is, soluble and insoluble
fractions). Alkaline hydrolysis leads to the removal of saccharides
which are O-linked to Ser or Thr and to the random breaking of peptide
bonds in proteins, producing single amino acids or small peptides.
Alkaline hydrolysis can also destroy monosaccharides and remove polysaccharide
critical function groups (e.g., acetyl).27 This choice was carried out because protease activity by PNGase
F (cleaving N-linked oligosaccharides at the N-glycosidic bond) and by other proteolitic enzymes having
a broad specificity (see the Supporting Information), which was expected to hydrolyze the protein regions, failed. This
is because their activity is restricted in the vicinity of densely
glycosylated regions of the protein, presumably because of steric
hindrance.28

The pscOM represents
about 8 wt % of the wOM, with a great variability
among different (n = 3) alkaline digestion experiments,
more specifically: 7 ± 4 wt % for Aca, 8 ± 4 wt % for Beu,
and 11 ± 6 wt % for Spi.

A first characterization of pscOM
was performed by FTIR spectroscopy.
In Figure 1, the most
representative spectra of pscOM for each species (small differences
in absorption profiles were recorded among samples from the same species)
are shown. A description of the assigned absorption bands is listed
in Table S1.29,30 The relative
intensities of these bands changed according to the pscOM source.
The spectra from all of the species showed that the most intense bands
were those because of polysaccharides (1200–1000 cm–1), namely the vibration modes associated with ring vibration overlapped
with stretching vibrations of carbonyl group and the glycosidic bond
vibration. In particular, at 1078 and 1037 cm–1,
ether bonds and C–C single bond vibration modes were present.
Weak absorption bands relative to methylene and methyl group vibration
mode and to absorption bands at 1634 and 1649 cm–1 could be associated with the presence of both N-acetyl and uronic acid residua. The FTIR spectrum of pscOM from
Spi showed the presence of absorption bands at 1453 and 1412 cm–1 that were probably because of carboxylic groups.
The pscOM from Beu showed additional weak bands at 1255 and 1235 cm–1 that can be associated with the S=O stretching,
suggesting the presence of sulfate groups.

(FTIR) spectra of intraskeletal polysaccharidic
components of the OM extracted from skeleton of A.
calycularis (Aca), B. europaea (Beu), and S. pistillata (Spi). The
wavenumbers of the main absorption bands are indicated (FTIR spectra
in the range 4000–400 cm–1 are reported in Figure S1).

The pscOM was further characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy. The 1H NMR pscOM spectrum of Spi was
the most detailed one (Figure S2), whereas
the other samples showed, despite the same purification process, large
amount of broad signals suggesting the presence of different molecular
components. The spectrum of Spi shows a predominant set of well-resolved
signals coming into the typical chemical shift region of polysaccharides
together with minor signals because of other minority components,
as suggested by the FTIR spectrum. Mono- and bidimensional NMR techniques
were used for the structure identification. Through 2D correlation
spectroscopy (COSY) and total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY), it
was possible to identify the anomeric signal and four secondary alcohol
signals belonging to the ring proton, whereas any −CH2– or primary alcohol signals were detected. The investigation
was prosecuted by heteronuclear 1H–13C COSY [heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC)] to verify
the number of carbon atoms and to obtain the chemical shift values
of their signals (Figure 2). The experiment confirmed the absence of diprotonated carbons
suggesting the presence of a uronic acid residue. Using an NMR spectrometer equipped
with cryoprobe, it was possible to perform a heteronuclear multiple
bond correlation experiment (HMBC). The result of Spi NMR studies
confirmed the working hypothesis of the presence of a uronic acid,
identifying the three and two bond distances carbon–proton
correlation, that is, the correlations of carboxyl in C6 with the
protons of carbon 4 and 5 of the sugar ring. The assigned chemical
shift values are reported in Table S2.

Figure 2 Combined
HSQC (red) and HMBC (heteronuclear multiple bond correlation;
black) partial spectra and spectral projections of S. pistillata. The assignment of major structure
signals are reported in black, whereas the correlation peaks between
carboxyl signal (C6) with proton 5 and 4 of glucuronic unit are marked
in blue as well as that of an N-acetyl residue. Homonuclear
coupling in sensitivity-enhanced HSQC spectrum has generated a COSY
effect.31 These correlation peaks, usually
considered as artifacts, have been very useful in the assignments.
Minor signal compatibles with carbohydrate structure(s) are present
in the spectrum.

The proton and carbon
chemical shift values of C1, C3, and C6 as
well as the anomeric proton coupling constant (J1–2) indicate the presence of a β 1–3 glucuronic
acid copolymer. The observed chemical shifts are in agreement with
the literature data reporting a synthetic model obtained by oxidation
of (1→3) β-curdlan, in spite of the different spectrum
calibration that cause a systematic 3 ppm shift in signals.32

Furthermore, experiments evidenced the
presence of an N-acetyl residue (1H: 2.02
ppm; 13C: 25 and
177 ppm) likely linked to unidentified saccharidic minor component(s),
whose detectable signals appear in the proton spectrum between 4.6
and 3.8 ppm and having different anomeric signals at 5.52, 5.08, and
5.03 ppm.

The above data were supplemented by the analysis of
constituent
monosaccharides. In view of the presence of a polyglucuronate polymer,
the Taylor and Conrad method was applied.33Table 1 summarizes
the results. The monosaccharide compositional pattern of pscOM from
Aca, Beu, or Spi was similar; all extracts were extremely rich in
glucuronic acid, which represented about 80 wt % of the total monosaccharides
in each of these fractions. Arabinose, galactose, mannose, and xylose
were also detected.

The function of pscOM in the calcification process was investigated
by in vitro calcium carbonate precipitation experiments. The presence
of pscOM (0.27 mg/cm3) partially inhibited the calcium
carbonate deposition with respect to a control experiment free of
pscOM (Figure S3), and it precipitated
aggregates having diverse shapes and morphologies (Figure 3). Higher or lower pscOM concentrations
provoked almost complete inhibition of precipitation or a reduced
effect on particles shape and morphology, respectively. The FTIR spectra
of these particles showed mainly the typical absorption bands of calcite,
together with a band at around 1630 cm–1 assignable
to polysaccharide and water (Figure S4).
In the presence of pscOM from Aca, crystals of calcite appeared randomly
aggregated in polycrystalline units that joined in big agglomerates
(up to ∼150 μm) (Figure 3; Aca1). Some insoluble components of the pscOM remained
among the crystalline aggregates and glued them; indeed, they separated
after bleaching. The aggregated calcite crystals almost completely
lost the {10.4} rhombohedral morphology and appeared edge-free (Figure 3; Aca2). The higher
magnification image (Figure 3; Aca3) showed that the curved surfaces of the crystals were
generated by the steps given by the combination of {10.4} and {hk.l} faces. Among the latter, the presence
of small {00.1} faces was identified (arrow in Figure 3; Aca2). The surfaces of the {10.4} faces
showed particles of about 200 nm. In the presence of pscOM from Beu,
calcitic spherulites having a diameter up to 180 μm formed (Figure 3; Beu1). Their flat
surface regions, associated with the {10.4} faces, were surrounded
by rough regions, associated with {hk.l} faces. The latter was shown on the surface platelike particles
of about 500 nm (Figure 3; Beu2–3). In the presence of pscOM from Spi, the rhombohedral
calcite crystals clustered in aggregates having a diameter up to 150
μm (Figure 3;
Spi1). In these aggregates, calcite crystals compenetrated and preserved
most of the {10.4} faces. They also exposed {hk.l} faces that smoothed the crystalline edges (Figure 3; Spi1). The {10.4} faces were
very flat, whereas crystallites of about 100 nm were observed on the
{hk.l} faces.

magnification (1–3) of crystals
obtained from in vitro CaCO3 crystallization experiments
from 10 mM CaCl2 solution in the presence of pscOMs from A. calycularis (Aca), B. europaea (Beu), and S. pistillata (Spi). These
pictures are the most representative of the populations of observed
particles.

The relevance of studying the
structure of pscOM and their influence
on the deposition of calcium carbonate in organisms are first given
by their high relative mass content with respect to other macromolecules
(i.e., proteins and lipids) into many calcified tissues.1−4 This is particularly true for stony corals from the Mediterranean
Sea, where their content was much higher than that of proteins.5 However, also other studies on tropical coral
species provided a similar outcome.11,13

The
pscOM investigated in this study represents only a fraction
of the whole content of polysaccharides associated with the wOM. This
is because the quite harsh treatment used for its extraction provoked
the degradation and loss of sugars (not quantifiable). For that reason,
its low mass content (about 8 wt %) in the wOM is not in conflict
with the 52 wt % of monosaccharides detected in the soluble OM from Acropora millepora.34 On
the other side, the remaining material was still polymeric (MW >
3500
Da, according to dialysis) and of reduced complexity, making easier
its structural characterization. Most importantly, its relevance for
in vitro calcification studies is proved by the capability to affect
the precipitation of calcium carbonate.

The monosaccharidic
distribution of the pscOM from Aca, Beu, and
Spi is similar (Table 1) and different from what was reported for other species of coral;35,36 for example, in A. millepora, a content
of about 70 wt % of arabinose and of about 3.9 wt % of glucuronic
acid was detected, but again, a diverse extraction procedure was used.
The corals monosaccharidic composition is also diverse with most of
sugar moieties associated with mollusks, where carbohydrates are quantitatively
minor in comparison to proteins.37

In the case of Spi, the NMR investigations detected the presence
of 1→3 β-d glucuronic acid polymers. To our
knowledge, this is the first identification of a polysaccharidic sequence
in the OM of corals.

This signature is in line with what was
observed in coccolith-associated
polysaccharides.18,19 One of this polysaccharide, referred
to as PS2, contains β-linked d-glucuronic acid sequences
and has the role to accumulate calcium ions in the coccolith formation
process.38 A coccolith contamination of
our samples should be excluded because: (i) the skeletons were accurately
observed by optical microscopy and did not show the presence of algae
incrustations; (ii) the skeletons’ X-ray powder diffraction
patterns did not show diffraction peaks because of calcite, the mineral
phase associate to coccoliths, but only aragonite; (iii) the relative
high amount of 1→3 β-d glucuronic acid polymers
in the pscOM composition cannot be justified by a contamination from
cocooliths, which if present, should be below the detection limit
of X-ray powder diffraction. Thus, the discovery that the pscOM contains
1→3 β-d glucuronic acid polymers may suggest
a function in concentrating calcium ions, as occurring in coccoliths.

The presence of an N-acetyl residue, linked to
unidentified saccharide minor component(s), may indicate the presence
of small amount of chitinlike structures, as already reported in old
studies,16,17 which were resistant to the chemical treatment.

The function of polysaccharide on coral calcification is completely
unknown, different from what was recently reported for proteins6−12 and/or lipids.38

Here, the influence
of pscOM on CaCO3 precipitation
was studied by comparing the results of experiments performed in the
presence of the pscOM, the wOM, and in the absence of additives. Without
additives, only rhombohedral calcite crystals precipitated, whereas
in the presence of pscOM, the morphologies observed were different
from those imaged in the presence of wOM (Figure S5), according to their diverse composition (Figure 3).

Shape and morphology
were different for particles formed in the
presence of pscOM from the diverse species. In them, the observed
morphology was generated by different crystal aggregation and the
relative extension of {10.4} and a-specific {hk.l} stepping faces. However, in the presence of pscOM
from Aca specific {00.1} faces were observed. This face was observed
in the calcite crystal grown in the presence of the polysaccharidic
component of the OM extracted from the skeleton of the mollusk Atrina rigida and associated with the interaction
with polysaccharidic moieties.39 In addition,
the observation of diverse kind of nanoparticles (or crystal units)
on the surface of the growing crystals agree with the recent observations
that scleractinia coral skeleton forms through the aggregation of
spherical particles of amorphous calcium carbonate.6−12

These differences in the texture of the calcite crystals occur
despite the similarity of the pscOM composition and the common presence,
directly detected only for Spi, of 1→3 β-d glucuronic
acid polymers. This observation is intriguing also considering that
these scleractinia corals belong to diverse families, Beu and Aca
to Dendrophylliidae, whereas Spi to Pocilloporidae.

In agreement
with what was observed in the precipitation experiment
of calcite, glucuronic acid concentrates and binds calcium ions38,40 and inhibits the nucleation process of calcium carbonate.23 Interestingly, the capability of the glucuronic
acid moieties to interact with calcium ions40 and calcite crystals22 is dependent on
the way they are bonded to a polypeptide core. This feature also changes
the assembly of calcite crystals from compenetrated units to spherulites,
with a concomitant reduction of the size of monocrystals.41 This knowledge may justify the diverse calcite
crystal shapes and textures observed in the presence of pscOM from
different coral species.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion,
in this study, for the first time, it is observed
that 1→3 β-d glucuronic acid polymers are in
the carbohydrate fraction of the wOM from corals. These polysaccharidic
moieties can acts as calcite morphology modifiers in a species-specific
manner. These discoveries shed a new light on the function of polysaccharide
in the molecular processes which govern coral calcification.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 OM Extraction
The samples of B. europaea and A. calycularis from Palinuro (Italian coast, North-Western
Mediterranean Sea) and S. pistillata from the Gulf of Eilat (Red Sea, Israel)
were randomly collected by scuba diving at 6, 9, and 10 m depths,
respectively. Coral skeletons were cleaned and ground, and wOM was
extracted through decalcification using a 0.1 M acetic acid solution,
as previously reported.42 wOM was weighed
and analyzed by FTIR spectroscopy using a Bruker ALPHA FTIR spectrometer
equipped with a single-reflection diamond-attenuated total reflection
accessory working in the range of wavenumbers 4000–400 cm–1 at a resolution of 4 cm–1.

4.2 Polysaccharide Purification
Protease
digestion: 50 mg of wOM were dispersed in sodium phosphate buffer
(100 mM, pH 7.8, 5 mL). Pronase (protease type XIV from Streptomyces griseus, Sigma-Aldrich; 10 pg) was added
and the solution was left for 24 h at 37 °C. Trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich;
50 μg) was added and left for an additional 18 h at 37 °C.
Then, the dispersion was extensively dialyzed against deionized water
and finally lyophilized. PNGase F treatment: 50 mg of wOM were dispersed
in 5 mL of a denaturing pH 7.5, 0.05 M phosphate buffer containing
0.5 wt % sodium dodecyl sulfate and 1 wt % mercaptoethanol by heating
at 100 °C for 2 min. PNGase F (20 units; Sigma-Aldrich) were
added and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. The dispersion was extensively
dialyzed against deionized water and finally lyophilized. Alkaline
digestion: 50 mg of wOM were dispersed in 5 mL of a 0.1 M NaOH solution
at room temperature and the resultant solution was stirred for 4 days
at room temperature. Then, the dispersion was extensively dialyzed
against deionized water and finally lyophilized and weighed.

The product of wOM enzymatic or chemical treatment was first characterized
by FTIR spectroscopy. Only the alkaline digestion provoked a reduction
of the proteic content, estimated by the intensity of FTIR absorption
of the amide I and amide II proteic bands.

4.3 Polysaccharide
Characterization
4.3.1 Monosaccharide Analysis
The polysaccharide
fraction from Spi, Beu, or Aca was carboxyl-reduced by the carbodiimide
method,33 using two successive cycles to
obtain reduced CH2OH from COOH groups of uronic acid units.
NaBH4 was used as the reducing agent. Monosaccharide components
of the carboxyl-reduced polysaccharide and their ratios were determined,
following hydrolysis with 1 M trifluoroacetic acid for 16 h at 100
°C. The acid was then evaporated, and the residue was dissolved
in water. The hydrolyzate was converted to alditol acetates by treatment
with NaBH4, followed by acetylation with acetic anhydride–pyridine
(1:1 v/v) at 100 °C for 30 min, and the resulting alditol acetates
were extracted with chloroform. The alditol acetate analysis was carried
out using a Varian gas chromatograph, model CP-3800, and mass spectrometer,
model Saturn 4000R, with He as the carrier gas (1 mL/min). A capillary
column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d.) of DB-1, held at 100 °C during
injection for 1 min, then programmed at 5 °C/min to 220 °C,
and held at 280 °C for 18 min was used for the quantitative analysis.
The alditol acetates were identified by their retention times and
typical electron impact breakdown profiles compared with standards.

4.3.2 NMR Characterization
The product
of the alkaline digestion was characterized by NMR spectroscopy. NMR
spectra were recorded at 25 °C using Bruker AVANCE III spectrometers
(600 and 500 MHz) equipped with high-sensitivity 5 mm TCI cryoprobes.
After exchanging 2 mg of the sample thrice in 2H2O, samples were dissolved in 0.6 mL of a 3 mM EDTA d62H2O (99.996%) solution and placed
in 5 mm NMR tubes. Proton spectra were recorded with presaturation
of the residual water signal with a recycle delay of 6 s and 32 scans.
Bidimensional DQF (double-quantum-filter)–COSY and 2D (two
dimensional)–TOCSY spectra were acquired using 16 scans per
series of 2048 × 256 data points with zero-filling in F1 (4096
× 1024), and a shifted (π/3) squared cosine function was
applied prior to Fourier transformation. HSQC and HMBC (heteronuclear
multiple bond correlation) spectra were obtained in phase-sensitivity-enhanced
pure-absorption mode with decoupling in the acquisition period. Scans
(40 and 96) were collected for each free-induction decay. The matrix
size of 1024 × 320 data points was zero-filled to 4096 ×
1024 by the application of a squared cosine function prior to Fourier
transformation.

4.4 Calcium Carbonate Crystallization
Experiments
Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in vitro
crystallization experiments
were carried out by vapor diffusion in a desiccator containing (NH4)2CO3 (Carlo Erba) and anhydrous CaCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich). Microplates for cellular culture (Microplate
24 well with lid, Iwaki), containing a round glass coverslip in each
well, were used as previously reported.42 CaCl2 solutions (750 μL of 10 mM; CaCl2 2H2O, Sigma-Aldrich) were poured in each well. wOM (0.2
mg) or pscOM (0.2 mg) were added in some well. This concentration
(0.27 mg/mL) ensured the optimal precipitation yield having a change
of the particle’s shape and morphology. Microplates were located
in the desiccator for 4 days at room temperature. The obtained crystals
were washed with distilled water and dried. CaCO3 crystallization
experiments were replicated at least five times.

Characterization
of CaCO3 precipitates was carried out by FTIR spectroscopy
and microscopic observations. FTIR spectra of samples in KBr disks
were collected at room temperature by using a Bruker ALPHA FTIR spectrometer
working in the range of 4000–400 cm–1 at
a resolution of 4 cm–1. Optical microscopic observations
of CaCO3 precipitates were carried out using a Leica microscope
equipped with a digital camera. SEM observations were conducted using
a Hitachi FEG 6400 scanning electron microscope after coating the
samples with gold.
