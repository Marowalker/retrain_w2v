Composite
films of proteins and polysaccharides have a broad range
of biomedical and food packaging applications, in which they are frequently
exposed to fluid environments with varying ionic strengths. In the
present work, we report the behavior of biopolymer films derived from
chitosan (Ch), gelatin (GEL), and Ch/GEL mixture in salt solutions
with varying concentrations and ion charges. The swelling and dissolution
of the Ch films reduced with increasing salt concentration due to
the polyelectrolyte behavior of this biopolymer, while the GEL films
displayed a polyampholyte behavior, in which film swelling and dissolution
were enhanced in salt solutions. Composite Ch/GEL films followed the
behavior of GEL. The release of small ionic and zwitter-ionic molecules
from the films was enhanced in ionic solutions due to the screened
attraction between these molecules and the polymer matrix. These results
provide insight into the behavior of protein/polysaccharide films
in varying ionic environments, thus enabling enhanced design of biomaterials
for a broad range of applications.

==== Body
Introduction
Composite polysaccharide–protein
films are used for food
packaging, cell culture, tissue engineering, and drug delivery. In
particular, chitosan/gelatin (Ch/GEL) films are utilized as edible
and biodegradable coatings,1,2 wound dressings,3 skin tissue engineering scaffolds,4 and transdermal drug delivery patches.5 Both biopolymers are cost-efficient, biocompatible,
and biodegradable. For packaging and coatings applications, both polymers
exhibit good film-forming properties, while, in addition, Ch provides
antimicrobial and antioxidant activities, as well as a decrease in
oxygen permeability.6 In tissue regeneration
applications, GEL promotes cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration,
thus enhancing wound recovery and tissue growth,4 while Ch offers antimicrobial properties7 and promotes wound recovery.8 Composite Ch/GEL films can also be used as “active”
materials for the delivery or absorption of small molecules in wound
dressings,2 active food packaging, and
edible films.9

Composite biopolymer
films are frequently exposed to fluid environments
with varying ionic strengths.10,11 Under these conditions,
film performance is closely related to its swelling and dissolution
behavior. In particular, depending on the pH, GEL containing amino
acids with positive (amine) and negative (carboxyl) ionizable groups
behaves as a polyampholyte,12 while Ch
is a copolymer of glucosamine (containing ionizable amine groups)
and n-acetyl glucosamine; thus, the latter behaves
as a polyelectrolyte.13

Due to the
polyelectrolyte and polyampholyte nature of Ch and GEL,
respectively, they exhibit distinct properties in ionic solutions.
A decrease in swelling with an increasing ionic strength of the solution
is expected for Ch films, since the repulsion between charged amine
groups of the polymer is screened in ionic solutions.14−16 In contrast, swelling of GEL close to its isoelectric point is enhanced
due to the weaker ionic cross-linking between the charged amine and
carboxyl groups.17 Far away from the isoelectric
point, screening of the repulsion between likely charged carboxyl
or amino groups results in a GEL polyelectrolyte behavior, in which
the degree of swelling decreases with an increasing salt concentration.

In the composite Ch/GEL films, ionic interactions between the positively
charged amine groups of Ch and the negatively charged carboxyl groups
of GEL are complemented by the formation of ion couples between the
amine and carboxylic groups of GEL and hydrogen bonds between the
hydroxyl, amine, and carboxyl groups of the respective polymers.18,19 In general, a polyampholyte behavior is expected; however, when
positively charged amine groups of Ch are present in excess, divalent
anions may cross-link them and cause reduced swelling of the films.20 The complex behavior of the Ch/GEL films in
ionic solutions is further complicated when they are used for the
delivery of small ionic molecules.

In the present work, we examined
the dissolution, swelling, and
change in the structure of Ch, GEL, and Ch/GEL composite films in
ionic solutions with varying salt concentrations and ion charges.
In addition, we explored the effect of varying ionic strength of the
solution on the release of small charged molecules such as rhodamine
B (RhB) and eosin Y (EosY) from the Ch, GEL, and Ch/GEK films. This
work provides insight into the nature of interactions in composite
protein–polysaccharide films in ionic media and thus broadens
their applications.

Experimental Section
Materials
Chitosan
was supplied by Kimica Marine Biopolymers
(LLWP). Gelatin type B, glacial acetic acid, NaCl, Na2SO4, CaCl2, o-phthalaldehyde, N-acetyl-l-cysteine, ethanol, sodium tetraborate
decahydrate, Folin’s phenol reagent, CuSO4, Na·K
tartrate, rhodamine B (RhB), and eosin Y (EosY) were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich Canada.

Film Preparation
All films were
prepared by solution-casting
on a glass slide or into a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) mold.
Solutions of Ch, GEL, and Ch/GEL mixtures were prepared with a solid
content of 2.5% (w/v), with Ch/GEL weight ratios of 1:0, 1:12, and
0:1, respectively. The final Ch solution contained 60% (w/w Ch) acetic
acid and the final Ch/GEL solution contained 20% (w/w Ch) acetic acid.

Film Dissolution and Swelling
The pH of salt solutions
used in the present work were in the range of 5.5–6.5 (measured
using a pH meter (EcoMet, P25)). Since film swelling and dissolution
in ionic solutions are close-to-concurrent processes, we determined
each of these characteristics separately. To characterize the swelling
and dissolution of the films after their 1 h incubation in the solutions,
650 μL of Ch, Ch/GEL, or GEL solution was cast onto 18 mm diameter
glass coverslips and dried at room temperature for 24 h. A dry film
was weighed and submerged into 50 mL of salt solution (NaCl, Na2SO4, or CaCl2) with concentrations varying
from 0 to 0.8 M. After 1 h, the film was removed from the solution,
excess water was carefully removed using a filter paper, and the film
was immediately weighed. Subsequently, it was dried for 24 h in a
vacuum oven at 70 °C and reweighed. These procedures were repeated
at least three times. The fraction of the film dissolved, MD, was determined as 1  where Wd is the
weight of the film after 1 h incubation in the solution and Wi is the initial weight of the film (both weights
were determined after drying the film in a vacuum oven at 70 °C
for 24 h).

The swelling ratio, Q, was determined
as 2  where Ws is the
weight of the film swollen for 1 h.

Film Dissolution under
Agitation
To characterize polymer
dissolution in water or NaCl solutions under agitation, the films
were prepared by casting 12 mL of Ch, Ch/GEL, or GEL solution into
a PTFE mold (2 mm × 6 cm × 6 cm) and drying at room temperature
for 24 h. The dry films were cut into 1 cm × 1 cm squares (14
mg), placed in 20 mL of 0–0.8 M NaCl solution, and stirred
at 100 rpm. At different time intervals, a sample of solution was
removed with a syringe and filtered through a filter with a pore size
of 0.45 μm. The amount of dissolved GEL and/or Ch was determined
using the colorimetric Lowry21 and o-phthalaldehyde assay.22

Lowry assay was used to determine the GEL dissolution from GEL and
Ch/GEL films. A supernatant solution (300 μL) was mixed with
1.5 mL of Lowry reagent solution, incubated for 10 min at 25 °C,
mixed with 150 μL of diluted Folin’s phenol reagent,
and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. Absorbance of the solution
was measured at 750 nm using a Varian Cary 50 UV–visible spectrometer.
Lowry reagent solution and diluted Folin’s phenol reagent were
prepared immediately prior to their use by mixing 50 mL of 2% Na2CO3 in 0.1 M NaOH with 1 mL of 0.5% CuSO4·5H2O in 1% Na·K tartrate, and 1 mL of Folin’s
phenol reagent with 1 mL of deionized (DI). An intensity–concentration
calibration curve was generated using aqueous solutions with five
GEL concentrations (Figure S1).

o-Phthalaldehyde assay was used to determine the
dissolution of Ch and Ch/GEL films. A supernatant solution (1 mL)
was mixed with 1 mL of the reagent solution of o-phthalaldehyde
and incubated for 1 h at 25 °C. Absorbance of this solution was
measured at 340 nm. o-Phthalaldehyde reagent solution
was prepared immediately prior to its use by adding 200 μL of
0.11 M o-phthalaldehyde and 0.071 M N-acetyl-l-cysteine solutions in ethanol to 5 mL of 0.2 M
borate buffer at pH 8.9. Two separate absorbance intensity–concentration
calibration curves were generated using 0–0.8 M NaCl solutions
with varying GEL and Ch concentrations in Figure S2. To determine the concentration of Ch and GEL following
the dissolution of Ch/GEL films, the concentration of GEL was measured
using Lowry assay and converted to the corresponding absorbance using
the o-phthalaldehyde assay intensity–concentration
calibration curve for GEL. This absorbance was subtracted from the
absorbance obtained using the o-phthalaldehyde assay
and the remaining absorbance value was used to calculate the Ch concentration.

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
After removal from
the solution, the films were frozen in liquid propane and lyophilized
for 2 days. The films were fractured and gold-coated using a SC7640
high-resolution sputter coater (QuorumTechnologies) for 30 s at 2.0
kV, and their cross sections were imaged using an FEI Quanta FEG 250
SEM.

Release of Ionic Molecules from Films
Rhodamine B (RhB)
or eosin Y (EosY) were mixed with solutions of Ch, GEL, or Ch/GEL
at 1 mM concentration. Films were prepared by casting 650 μL
of Ch, Ch/GEL, or GEL solution onto 18 mm diameter glass coverslips
and dried at room temperature for 24 h. The dry films were submerged
into 20 mL of 0–0.8 M NaCl solution. At different time intervals,
500 μL of the supernatant was removed, filtered (0.45 μm
pore size), and mixed with 500 μL of PBS buffer (pH 7.4). The
mixture was analyzed using a Varian Cary 5000 UV–visible spectrometer
at 554 and 512 nm for RhB and EosY, respectively.

Results
Chitosan Films
Figure 1 shows the
variation in the fraction of the Ch film
dissolved, MD, and the degree of film
swelling upon its incubation in NaCl, CaCl2, and Na2SO4 solutions. In Figure 1a, the values of MD for the Ch films are plotted vs the concentrations of NaCl, Na2SO4, and CaCl2 solutions. Comparison
of film dissolution in the solutions of salts of monovalent (Na+, Cl–) and divalent ions (SO42–, Ca2+) ions revealed a consistent
trend: the extent of Ch film dissolution decreased with increasing
salt concentration. The value of MD reduced
in the sequence NaCl > CaCl2 > Na2SO4 (clearly observed for 0.2 and 0.4 M salt solutions). For
0.8 M salt
solutions, the fraction of the film dissolved reduced to ∼1%.

of the film dissolved (MD) and (b) the
degree of swelling (Q) after 1 h film incubation
in water (DI) and NaCl, Na2SO4, and CaCl2 solutions, plotted as a function of salt concentration. The
error bars show the standard deviation obtained in three independent
experiments.

Figure 1b shows
the variation in the swelling ratio, Q, after Ch
film incubation for 1 h in NaCl, CaCl2, and Na2SO4 solutions with the concentration in the range of 0–0.8
M. The trend in the variation in Q correlated with
the change in film dissolution (shown in Figure 1a): in all salt solutions, the swelling of
the Ch films decreased with increasing salt concentration. In particular,
in NaCl solutions, film swelling decreased exponentially with concentration,
that is, from 4120 in water to 181% in 0.8 M NaCl solution, respectively.
For NaCl and CaCl2 solutions with the same salt concentration,
higher values of Q were measured for NaCl solutions.
In the Na2SO4 solution, the values of Q were consistently lower than those in the solutions containing
Cl– anions. While the effect of the variation in
the ionic strength of salt solutions is shown in Figure S3, Supporting Information, we note that for the three
salt solutions at the ionic strength of 0.6 M (for 0.6 M NaCl, 0.2
M Na2SO4, and 0.2 M CaCl2 solutions),
the variation of Q showed a trend that was similar
to film dissolution (Figure 1a): film exposure to the solutions containing Cl– anions resulted in similar Q values (332 vs 386%
for NaCl and CaCl2 solutions, respectively), while exposure
to Na2SO4 solution showed a significantly lower Q value of 164%.

Figure 2 shows the
morphology of the cross section of the Ch films swollen in water and
in a 0.8 M NaCl solution. The swelling time was limited to 30 s to
minimize the effect of film dissolution. The water-swollen film (Figure 2a) exhibited large
pores and thickness of ∼300 μm, which was significantly
larger than 29 μm of the film prior to swelling experiments
(Figure S3). Furthermore, Figure 2a shows a gradient in the Ch
film structure: the size of the pores decreased from the film–water
interface (bottom) toward the film–glass interface. In contrast,
the Ch film exposed to 0.8 M NaCl solution showed an insignificant
change in structure or thickness, in comparison with an original film
(Figure 2b). In contrast
to the Ch film incubated in water, swelling in 0.8 M NaCl solution
resulted in a minor change in film thickness from 29 to 39 μm,
and the structure of the film did not appear to be porous under the
magnification used.

water and

Gelatin Films
Figure 3 shows the variation in the fraction of the GEL film
dissolved and the degree of film swelling upon incubation in NaCl,
CaCl2, and Na2SO4 solutions. In Figure 3a, the values of MD for the GEL films are plotted vs the concentrations
of NaCl, Na2SO4, and CaCl2 solutions.
For the films incubated in NaCl solutions, the changes in film dissolution,
in comparison with films incubated in water, were not statistically
significant (p > 0.05). The dissolution of the
GEL
films in the solutions containing anions of SO42– reduced with increasing salt concentration. Film dissolution in
solutions containing Ca2+ cations drastically increased
with increasing salt concentration (and in 0.8 M CaCl2 showed MD value of 79%).

Figure 3 Stability of GEL films
in ionic solutions. (a) Variation in the
fraction of the film dissolved (MD) and
(b) the degree of swelling (Q) after 1 h film incubation
in water (DI) and in NaCl, Na2SO4, and CaCl2 solutions, plotted as a function of salt concentration. Due
to the complete dissolution of the GEL films in 0.8 M CaCl2 solution, no swelling data are shown for CaCl2 at that
concentration. The error bars show the standard deviation for three
independent experiments.

Figure 3b
shows
the variation in the swelling ratio, Q, after the
GEL film incubation for 1 h in NaCl, CaCl2, and Na2SO4 solutions. The variation in Q showed a strong dependence on the type of solution it was exposed
to. The value of Q increased from 630% in water to
985% in the 0.8 M NaCl solution. In solutions containing Ca2+ cations, the degree of film swelling increased from 630% (water)
to 1220% in 0.6 M CaCl2 solution, that is, it was significantly
higher than that in NaCl solutions. When comparing film swelling in
these solutions at the ionic strength of 0.6 M, the Q values for the GEL films exposed to NaCl and CaCl2 solutions
were close, that is, 940 and 890%, respectively, while in solutions
containing SO42– anions, the film swelling
first increased from 630% (water) to 750% in 0.2 M CaSO4 solution and then decreased to 306% in 0.8 M solution. The effect
of the variation in the ionic strength of salt solutions is shown
in Figure S4, Supporting Information.

Figure 4 shows the
morphology of the cross section of the GEL films swollen in water
and 0.8 M NaCl solution. The thickness of the GEL film increased 10-fold
after its incubation in water (Figures 4a and S4). Small pores were
observed in this film under high magnification (Figure 4c). The film exposed to a 0.8 M NaCl solution
(Figure 4b) was ∼14-fold
thicker than the original GEL film. Notably, larger pores were observed
in this film, in comparison with the film swollen in water (Figure 4d). In addition,
small NaCl particles were embedded in the film, indicating deep solution
penetration in the film and a greater degree of swelling.

d) 0.8 M NaCl solution.

Composite Ch/Gel Films
Figure 5 illustrates the swelling and dissolution
behavior of the composite films prepared at the Ch/GEL mass ratio
of 1:12 and exposed to NaCl, CaCl2, and Na2SO4 solutions. The variation in the fraction of the film dissolved
was similar to that of the GEL films due to the large fraction of
this polymer in the film. For the films incubated in NaCl solutions,
the change in MD was not statistically
significant (p > 0.05) in comparison with MD in water. The dissolution of the films in
solutions containing Ca2+ cations increased with increasing
salt concentration, e.g., from 6.5 to 25.6% for the films incubated
in water and 0.8 M CaCl2 solution, respectively. For the
films incubated in solutions containing SO42– anions, the dissolution of the films noticeably decreased with increasing
salt concentration. The effect of the variation in the ionic strength
of the salt solutions is shown in Figure S5, Supporting Information.

Figure 5 Stability of Ch/GEL films in ionic solutions.
(a) Variation in
the fraction of the Ch/GEL film dissolved (MD) and (b) the degree of swelling (Q) after
1 h film incubation in water (DI) and in NaCl, Na2SO4, and CaCl2 solutions, plotted as a function of
salt concentration. The error bars show the standard deviation obtained
in three independent experiments.

Figure 5b
shows
the variation in the degree of swelling, Q, for the
Ch/GEL films incubated in NaCl, Na2SO4, and
CaCl2 solutions. In solutions containing the monovalent
anion Cl–, the swelling of the Ch/GEL films increased
with increasing salt concentration and was stronger in CaCl2 than in NaCl solution. At an ionic strength of 0.6, the Q values for the Ch/GEL films exposed to NaCl and CaCl2 solutions were similar, i.e., 682 and 668%, respectively,
and in solutions containing SO42– anions,
the swelling of the Ch/GEL films decreased with increasing salt concentration.

Figure 6 shows the
morphology of the cross section of the composite Ch/GEL films swollen
in water and 0.8 M NaCl solution (Figure 6a,c,b,d respectively). After incubation in
water, the film had the thickness of 505 μm, that is, 8-fold
larger than that of the Ch/GEL film prior to its exposure to water
(Figure S5). Similar to that of the GEL
film, the Ch/GEL film swollen in water had small pores (Figure 6c). After incubation in a 0.8
M NaCl solution (Figure 6b), the film exhibited stronger swelling than that in water to reach
the thickness of 620 μm (Figure 6a). Interestingly, in both cases, a horizontal boundary
was observed in the film. Above the boundary (closer to the film/solution
interface), the film was more porous than at the bottom film region,
which was caused by the front of water diffusing in the film. Overall,
the Ch/GEL films showed the trend characteristic of the GEL films,
that is, a stronger degree of swelling and a more porous structure
after incubation in 0.8 M NaCl solution than in water.

films swollen for 1 h in (a, c) water
and (b, d) 0.8 M NaCl solution.

Film Dissolution under Agitation
The behavior of biopolymer
films in ionic solutions under the action of mechanical forces may
be important for film function.23 For example,
mastication and the peristaltic contraction of the esophagus and stomach
expose the polymer coating on orally administered tablets to mechanical
stress and affect the dissolution, swelling, and release of a drug.24 In our work, film stability under the action
of mechanical forces was determined under the agitation of the solution
at 100 rpm.

Figure 7a shows the variation in the fraction of the film dissolved
for the Ch films incubated under agitation in 0–0.8 M NaCl
solutions. Film dissolution was tested after 1 h (Figure S6); however, an invariant MD value was reached already after 10 min due to the enhanced transport
properties. Figure 7a shows a trend observed under static conditions: with an increasing
salt concentration, MD for the Ch films
drastically reduced. In particular, after 2 min incubation, the value
of MD was 71 and 0.35% for water and 0.8
M NaCl solution, respectively. At longer incubation times, the Ch
films exposed to solutions with the concentration of up to 0.4 M NaCl
exhibited close-to-complete (>90%) dissolution, while in 0.6 and
0.8
M NaCl solutions, the films preserved 13% (±2.8) and 0.85% (±0.11)
of their weight, respectively.

Figure 7 Temporal variation in the fraction of
(a) Ch, (b) GEL, and (c)
Ch/GEL dissolved under agitation at 100 rpm in solutions with varying
NaCl concentration: (purple circle solid) 0 M, (brown circle solid)
0.2 M, (yellow circle solid) 0.4 M, (gray circle solid) 0.6 M, and
(red circle solid) 0.8 M. The error bars show the standard deviation
obtained in three independent experiments.

For the GEL films, the value of MD increased
over the 1 h time interval in NaCl solutions and with increasing NaCl
concentration (Figure 7b). Composite Ch/GEL films exhibited a trend characteristic for the
GEL films: the value of MD increased over
1 h time interval in NaCl solutions and with increasing NaCl concentration
(Figure 7c).

Release
of Low-Molecular-Weight Ionic Molecules from the Films
Biopolymer
films such as protein and polysaccharide coatings are
extensively used for the encapsulation and delivery of functional
ingredients. For example, Ch and GEL films are utilized in the treatment
of wounds and infections for the delivery of zwitterionic drugs such
as ciprofloxacin25 and ofloxacin26 and anionic drugs such as diclofenac sodium27 and ibuprofen.28 In
addition, Ch films are used to encapsulate anionic antioxidants and
antimicrobial components, e.g., malic and citric acids29 for food packaging applications. Due to the
ionic nature of proteins and many polysaccharides, the release of
the ionic functional ingredients depends on their interactions with
the biopolymer matrices. Furthermore, the release may occur in ionic
environments, e.g., in the salty solutions produced from high-salt
content foods,11 drinking water, and gastric
fluid. The ionic strength of these solutions may influence the release
of small molecules incorporated in the films.30

We explored the release of the zwitterionic dye rhodamine
B (RhBD) and the anionic dye eosin Y (EosYD)
from the Ch, GEL, and Ch/GEL films into the solutions with varying
NaCl concentration. The release of RhB and EosY from the Ch films
increased with increasing salt concentration (Figure 8a,b, respectively). In particular, the cumulative
release of the zwitterionic RhB after 1 h was 27 and 93% in water
and 0.4 M NaCl solution, respectively. The release of the anionic
EosY was significantly lower, that is, 0.4 and 9.3% in water and 0.8
M NaCl, respectively.

Figure 8 Temporal variation in the fraction of cationic dye RhB
(RhBD) and anionic dye EosY (EosYD) released
from the
(a, d) Ch, (b, e) GEL, and (c, f) Ch/GEL films, respectively, in solutions
with varying NaCl concentrations: (purple circle solid) 0 M, (yellow
circle solid) 0.4 M, and (red circle solid) 0.8 M. The error bars
show the standard deviation obtained in three independent experiments.

The release of RhB and EosY from
the GEL films showed a different
trend: the release of RhB increased and EosY decreased in NaCl solutions
in comparison with water. For the release of RhB, this trend was less
pronounced than that for the Ch films, with 75 and 99% release in
water and 0.8 M NaCl solution, respectively. The release of EosY from
the GEL films was greater than from the Ch films, with 54 and 38%
release in water and 0.8 M NaCl solution, respectively.

Interestingly,
the release of the dyes from the Ch/GEL films showed
the trend that was similar to that of the Ch films: the release of
RhB and EosY increased with increasing NaCl concentration. Notably,
the release of EosY was intermediate between those of the GEL and
Ch films, with a minimum release of 7% and a maximum release of 26%
in water and 0.8 M NaCl solution, respectively.

Discussion
The swelling and dissolution properties of Ch, GEL, and Ch/GEL
films originated from the balance between the osmotic pressure and
the elasticity of the polymer network. The increase in salt concentration
in the solution (or increase in its ionic strength) resulted in an
increase in the osmotic pressure, thus favoring film swelling. The
elasticity depended on nonionic and ionic interactions between the
polymer charged groups as well as the interactions of these groups
with ions in the solution. Chitosan is a weak polyelectrolyte (base)
with pKa ∼6.3, while gelatin is
a polyampholyte with a weak acid (pKa =
4.3) and weak base behavior (pKa ∼
6.3). In the pH range of 5.5–6.5 of the salt solutions used
in the present work, the carboxylic and amine groups of the biopolymers
were ionized. Figure 9 illustrates the variation in the repulsive forces acting between
the positively charged groups of polyelectrolyte and the attractive
forces acting between the charged groups of GEL polyampholyte. The
decrease in the swelling and dissolution of the Ch films with increasing
ionic strength originated from its polyelectrolyte nature, that is,
the screened electrostatic repulsion of the primary amine groups,14,15 and thus polymer densification.31,32 The penetration
of water molecules in the film favored its swelling and dissolution
in water at pH 7.0 and was suppressed in salt solutions. Notably,
in addition to the screening of the repulsive interactions between
the protonated amine groups, in Na2SO4 solutions,
SO42– anions could act as cross-linkers
of the protonated amine groups, thus further restricting the ability
of the films to swell and solubilize. Thus, at the same ionic strength
of NaCl, CaCl2, and Na2SO4 solutions,
the dissolution and swelling of the Ch films were strongly suppressed.

Figure 9 Illustration
of the ionic interactions of Ch polyelectrolyte and
GEL polyampholyte in water and ionic solutions. The ionic repulsion
between NH3+ groups of Ch (polyelectrolyte)
and attraction between COO– and NH3+ groups of GEL (polyampholyte) is screened with increasing
ionic strength, thus resulting in contraction and expansion of the
polymer network, respectively.

The enhanced swelling of the GEL films with increasing NaCl
concentration
was caused by interactions of the amine and carboxyl groups of this
biopolymer (in approximately 36 mmol33 and
100–115 mmol per 100 g, respectively, density)34 and thus the polyampholyte nature of this biopolymer. As
the isoelectric point of GEL of 4.7–5.3,34 both positive NH3+ and negative COO– groups coexisted on the GEL molecules (although in
a different number), thus forming ion couples (Figure 9, bottom). In salt solutions, attractive
interactions were screened by the Na+ and Cl– counterions, thus resulting in enhanced water penetration between
polymer chains and enhanced swelling.35

The swelling and dissolution behavior of the GEL films in
CaCl2 and Na2SO4 solutions depended
on the
interactions between Ca2+ and SO42– ions with water molecules and with GEL. The change in these properties
with increasing CaCl2 and Na2SO4 concentrations
resembled the trend of the Hoffmeister series.36 The introduction of Ca2+ ions resulted in the
“salting in” effect, that is, an increase in protein
solubility in water, while SO42– ions
led to the “salting out” effect, that is, a decrease
in protein solubility in the corresponding solutions.37 Thus, a comparison of the film behavior in solutions of
the same ionic strength was not straightforward.

The similarity
between the swelling and the dissolution properties
of the Ch/GEL and GEL films was attributed to the dominating effect
of the GEL component and the formation of the polyampholyte–polyelectrolyte
complex between Ch and GEL due to interactions between the amino groups
of Ch and the carboxyl groups of GEL.38 As a result, increased swelling was observed for the Ch/GEL films
with increasing NaCl content. A lower degree of swelling than that
for the GEL films in water was attributed to the formation of ionic
cross-links between the amine groups of Ch and the excess deprotonated
carboxyl groups of GEL.

Agitation resulted in an increase in
the rate of dissolution of
all films, as it reduced film integrity and provided convective current
of the dissolution medium, thus enhancing transport properties.24,38,39 This effect was observed for
all of the films and all of the solutions studied in the present work.

Interestingly, the trends observed for the release of RhB and EosY
were the result of the ionic interactions between the ionic groups
of the polymer and the dyes,40 rather than
interpolymer interactions: for Ch films, the enhanced dye release
with increasing NaCl concentration was not expected from the trends
observed for the swelling and dissolution of these films. We ascribe
this difference to the attraction of the amine groups of Ch and the
negatively charged carboxyl groups of RhB41 or carboxyl and phenol groups of EosY.20 When this attraction was screened by Na+ and Cl– ions, the release of dye molecules was enhanced with increasing
NaCl concentration. Notably, EosY is a divalent anion, which could
cross-link the protonated amine groups of Ch, thus causing a significantly
weaker release, in comparison with RhB.

In the GEL films containing
RhB, in the pH range of salt solutions,
attraction existed between amine and carboxyl groups of GEL and RhB.42 Screening of this attraction by Na+ and Cl– ions enhanced the release of RhB dye with
increasing NaCl concentration. The opposite trend observed for the
release of EosY originated from the dominant negative GEL charge,43 and therefore, an ionic repulsion between deprotonated
carboxyl groups of GEL and EosY. This ionic repulsion was screened
in NaCl solutions, and the release of EosY was suppressed at increased
NaCl content.

Similar to GEL films, the attraction between RhB
and charged amine
and carboxyl groups of Ch/GEL films was screened in NaCl solutions,
which resulted in greater RhB release with increasing NaCl concentration.
Conversely, although Ch/GEL films were predominantly composed of GEL,
the screening of attraction between the carboxylic and amine groups
of Ch and GEL43 resulted in enhanced release
of EosY from these films with increasing NaCl concentration.

Conclusions
We conducted a comprehensive study of the swelling and dissolution
properties of the Ch and GEL films, as well as the release of small
ionic molecules from these films in ionic solutions. The distinct
swelling and dissolution behavior of the Ch and GEL films stemmed
from their polyelectrolyte and polyampholyte behavior, respectively.
For the Ch films, an increasing ionic strength of salt solutions resulted
in the screening of the electrostatic repulsion between positively
charged amine groups, thus resulting in decreased swelling and dissolution.
For the GEL films, an increasing ionic strength of salt solutions
resulted in screened attraction between ionized carboxyl and amine
groups, thus resulting in enhanced swelling and dissolution (a polyampholyte
behavior). The stability of the composite Ch/GEL films was dominated
by the GEL behavior. The swelling and dissolution of these films in
solutions containing Ca2+ and SO42– ions was related to the solubility of GEL in the corresponding solutions
and resembled the trend of the Hoffmeister series. Agitation increased
the rate of dissolution of all films. The release of RhB and EosY
molecules from the film was governed by their interactions with the
ionic groups of the biopolymers. It was enhanced with increasing NaCl
concentration for all films, with the exception of EosY–GEL
films. For this dye, screening of an ionic repulsion between GEL and
EosY by Na+ and Cl– ions suppressed the
dye release. These results provide enhanced understanding of the factors
influencing the properties of a biopolymer film in ionic solutions,
thereby enabling the development of biopolymer films with applications
in ionic media.
