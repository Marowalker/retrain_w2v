The objective of
this research was to find the possible pharmacognosy
of the bark of the Philippine Alstonia macrophylla Wall. ex G.Don (AM). Gas chromatographic–mass spectral (GC–EI-MS)
characterization and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were
performed to detect the bioactive constituents. EDX analysis of AM
bark displayed a high content of potassium (3.26%) and calcium (2.96%).
Eight constituents were detected in AM crude dichloromethane (DCM)
extracts, which consisted of a long-chain unsaturated fatty acid (17:0)
and fatty acid esters such as ethyl hexadecanoate and methyl hexadecanoate.
Extraction of AM bark using methanol and dimethyl sulfoxide (MeOH/DMSO)
solvents resulted in the identification of 17 constituents, principally
alkaloids (alstonerine, 34.38%; strictamin, 5.23%; rauvomitin, 4.29%;
and brucine, 3.66%) and triterpenoids (γ-sitosterol, 3.85%; lupeol, 3.00%; 24-methylenecycloartanol,
2.81%; campesterol, 2.71%; β-amyrin, 2.30%; and stigmasterol,
2.13%). MeOH/DMSO samples of AM were used in the selected bioassays.
The samples exhibited efficient free radical scavenging activity (IC50 = 0.71 mg/mL) and were noncytotoxic to normal HDFn (IC50 > 100 μg/mL) and neoplastic THP-1 cell lines (IC50 = 67.22 μg/mL) while highly degenerative to MCF-7
(IC50 = 6.34 μg/mL), H69PR (IC50 = 7.05
μg/mL), and HT-29 (IC50 = 9.10 μg/mL). Most
interestingly, the AM samples inhibited the northern Philippine Cobra’s
(Naja philippinensis Taylor) venom (IC50 = 297.27 ± 9.33 μg/mL) through a secretory phospholipase
A2 assay.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Medicinal plants are still
widely used in nonindustrialized societies
such as in many parts of Southeast Asia because they are readily available
and cheaper than modern medicines. In the Philippines, some of the
most important and highly recognized medicinal plants belong to genus Alstonia in the family Apocynaceae. Two of its five Philippine
native species, Alstonia macrophylla Wall. ex G.Don
and Alstonia scholaris (L.) R. Br., are locally important,
and various organs of these plants are harvested as natural remedies
for human ailments.

Both A. macrophylla and A. scholaris were reported to contain echitovenidine, echitamine,
venenatine
(an indole alkaloid), and anti-inflammatory triterpenoids.1−5 The bark of the A. scholaris, the most intensively
used organ of this species, was recently found to have strong antifungal
activity.6 It was also found to relieve
anxiety- and stress-related incidences through stabilization of distress-induced
physiological deviations seen in mice plasma.7,8

In its powdered form, the bark of A. macrophylla (AM), also known as hard milkwood or batino, is used in wine preparation
and as an antipyretic, traditional remedy and preventive concoction,
medicine for dysentery, an aid in the menstrual cycle, treatment in
Alzheimer’s disease through down regulation of acetylcholine,
and in wound healing.9−11 When mixed with water, the powdered bark can be used
as an astringent and for treating skin diseases.12 Apart from the bark, crushed leaves of AM, when mixed with
copra oil and warmed, were applied as heated dressings to joint and
muscle injuries.13 Moreover, decoctions
of its undeveloped aerial plant parts were ingested as a curative
for respiratory and auditory obstructions.14 Mixed preparations of leaves and stem bark of AM were used in the
Republic of India to treat upset stomachs, dermal conditions, and
bacterial infections of the urinary tract.12,15 Similar to A. scholaris, AM leaves extracted with
methanol similarly exhibited antimicrobial properties.16

A variety of phytochemical analytes have
been reported from distinct
organs of AM. Phytochemical investigations of AM afforded steroid
alcohols, isoprenoids, hydroxylated polyphenolic compounds, alkaloids,
tannic acids, and monosaccharides. AM was found to be rich in β-sitosterol,
a phytosterol that is an effective inhibitor of semen movability,
and has possible use as a family planning medicine for women.17 A study of the aerial parts reported 19 alkaloidal
compounds, 15 of which were elucidated. In another study, also using
leaf extracts yielded 10 undiscovered indole alkaloids, alstomaline,
10,11-dimethoxynareline, alstohentine, alstomicine, 16-hydroxyalstonisine,
16-hydroxyalstonal, 16-hydroxy-N4-demethylalstophyllal oxindole, alstophyllal,
6-oxoalstophylline, and 6-oxoalstophyllal, in consort with 21 others
already discovered by a previous study.9 Like A. scholaris, AM also has abundant alkaloids.
To date, nearly 70 dissimilar categories of alkaloid derivatives have
been described in various organs of AM, and a majority of them were
isolated from the stem bark.18

In
this work, we established the antioxidant (by a modified assay
using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)), cytotoxic (HT-29, H69PR,
MCF-7, THP-1 immortalized cell lines, and normal HDFn primary culture
cells), and antivenom activities of crude AM extracts. Chemical characterization
was achieved utilizing gas chromatography in tandem with mass spectrometry
and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. After our thorough investigation,
we believe that this original work is the first to describe the research
of these selected bioassay experiments of crude AM extracts using
a MeOH/DMSO solvent extraction protocol of A. macrophylla bark.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 GC–EI-MS
Assessments of AM
Gas chromatographic–mass spectral
examinations of the DCM
preparations of AM detected the presence of eight analytes. The verified
volatile constituents of the reaction mixture were confirmed through
retention index (RI) and structural category via the NIST Archive.
In Table 1, the findings
are enumerated corresponding to peak succession visualization on an
HP-5 ms column. The sample, seen in Table 1 and Figure 1, consisted chiefly of a fatty acid and fatty acid
esters: heptadecanoic acid (16.61%); hexadecanoic acid ethyl ester
(12.21%); and hexadecanonic acid methyl ester (10.46%).

The MEOH/DMSO crude AM extracts were composed primarily of alkaloids
(Table 2 and Figure 1): alstonerine (34.38%),
strictamin (5.23%), rauvomitin (4.29%), and brucine (3.66%). Other
notable constituents from this polar extract were triterpenoids: γ-sitosterol
(3.85%), lupeol (3.00%), 24-methylenecycloartanol (2.81%), campesterol
(2.71%), β-amyrin (2.30%), and stigmasterol (2.13%). Since more
bioactive phytochemicals were found in the MEOH/DMSO crude AM extracts,
extracts using this solvent extraction technique were used in all
the subsequent bioassays.

2.2 EDX Analysis
of AM
The chemical compositions
of the adsorbents were found to have an elemental percentage (<ppm)
of K (3.26%), Ca (2.96%), Cl (0.93%), S (0.60%), Si (0.47%), P (0.30%),
Fe (0.05%), Mn (0.03%), and Zn (0.04%) with glucose, C6H10O5, making up 91.36%. Elevated percentages of potassium (K) and calcium
(Ca) suggest that the plant metabolized high consumption of mineral
nutrients absorbed from the soil of the sample as demonstrated in Figure 2. Assessments linking
calcium ingestion in healthy elderly women were determined to ameliorate
lipid panels, sugar metabolic rate, and normalization of hypertension.21,22 The increase in the consumption of potassium-rich foods has been
well established to regulate cardiovascular anomalies, alleviate orthopedic
and renal diseases, and prevent strokes.23

Figure 2 EDX
image (top) and X-ray energy spectrum (bottom) of AM bark.

Other genera from the Apocynaceae family were subjected
to EDX
analyses. The pulverized aerial material and nodal and internodal
bark powder (2.0 g) of Grewia lasiocarpa E.Mey. ex
Harv. underwent elemental analyses using an energy dispersive X-ray
spectrometer (EDX), connected to software operated by the Aztec system
from Oxford Instruments (U.K.). Twenty-two elements were found present,
of which three foremost essential elements were obtained [sodium (Na),
sulfur (S), and calcium (Ca)]. Fifteen residual metals [chromium (Cr),
manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), magnesium
(Mg), iodine (I), potassium (K), molybdenum (Mo), silicon (Si), nickel
(Ni), tin (Sn), selenium (Se), and vanadium (V)] and five transition
elements [arsenic (As), mercury (Hg), rubidium (Rb), cadmium (Cd),
and lead (Pb)] were present.24

Elemental
investigations performed on powdered leaves, stems, and
roots of Ichnocarpus frutescens wherein copper sample
remnants were prepared pursuant to coating with a gold sputter coater.
Elemental analyses were restricted to eleven elements (C, O, Mg, Al,
Si, Cl, K, Ca, Fe, Cu, and Zn). The mineral content for the roots
displayed the presence of all the specified elements; however, the
leaves were deficient in iron and aluminum, and the stem was deficient
in magnesium.25

2.3 Antioxidant
Activity of AM
AM crude
extracts were found to be effective free radical scavengers given
that the IC50 value was low at 0.71 mg/mL (Figure 3). A previous report showed
that three chief constituents purified from the methanolic fraction
of A. macrophylla leaf, specifically β-sitosterol,
ursolic acid, and β-sitosteryl-β-d-glucoside,
as well as a minor fraction found to have alkaloid and fatty acids
were the entities that induced antioxidant activity at an effective
concentration of 200 mg/kg (DPPH protocol evaluations, superoxide
anion quenching experiments, and DNA cleavage assay).17

Figure 3 Free radical scavenging analyses of AM.

2.4 Cytotoxicity Assays
The cytotoxicity
of the crude extract of AM was investigated on MCF-7, H69PR, HT-29,
THP-1 immortalized cell lines, and normal HDFn primary culture cells.
Analyses of the cytotoxicity of AM done on normal HDFn resulted in
IC50 values exceeding 100 μg/mL. Zeocin, a DNA intercalating
agent, was used as the positive control in all the trials. An illustration
of the percent of intact live cells as a correlation to the inverse
function to exponentiation of the concentrations used can be found
in Figures 4 and 5. The characteristic inhibitory dose–response,
which is a sigmoidal curve or function, was found in generally most
of the charts. Plots comparing the cytotoxic properties of AM and
Zeocin on the viability of each specific cell line are found in Figure 4. IC50 values of the isolates and the positive control are synopsized in Table 3.

Figure 4 Cytotoxic activities
of AM, Zeocin, and DMSO on the cytotoxicity
index (CI%) of immortalized cell lines (dose–response curves
with data points as mean ± SEM). GraphPad Prism 7.01 (GraphPad
Software, Inc., USA) was employed for extra sum-of-squares F test calculations to (A) appraise the implication of the
best-fit-parameter (half maximal inhibitory concentration) between
selected trials and to (B) assess the variances amid the dose–response
curve fits. MCF-7 F (Dfn, DFd) = (A) F (2, 48) = 3192, p < 0.0001 and (B) F (2, 21) = 34.37, p < 0.0001; H69PR (A) F (2, 48) = 5205, p < 0.0001and (B) F (2, 21) = 29.45, p < 0.0001; HT-29
(A) F (2, 46) = 4892, p < 0.0001
and (B) F (2, 21) = 18.81, p <
0.0001; THP-1 (A) F (2, 48) = 3511, p < 0.0001 and (B) F (2, 21) = 12.41, p = 0.0003; HDFn (A) F (2, 48) = 1577, p < 0.0001 and (B) F (2, 21) = 27.70, p < 0.0001.

Figure 5 Cytotoxic activities of AM based on the CI% of the immortalized
cell lines. Graphs show the result of AM on individual cell lines.
Dose–response curves were formed from data points as mean ±
SEM. The GraphPad Prism 7.01 software was applied to perform the extra
sum-of-squares F test to (A) gauge the implication
of the best-fit-parameter of IC50 values between separate
treatments and to (B) ascertain the variances amid the dose–response
curve congruency. AM, (A) F (4, 80) = 445.2, p < 0.0001 (B) F (4, 35) = 4.176, p = 0.0072.

a IC50 data were deduced
from dose–response graphs extrapolated from nonlinear regression
analysis by means of GraphPad Prism 7.01 The unpaired two-tailed t test was the treatment employed for each cell line to
evaluate the significant variances among the data groups. The statistical
data were as follows: MCF-7, t (14) = 0.7047, p = 0.4925; H69PR, t (14) = 0.7285, p = 0.4783; HT-29, t (14) = 1.056, p = 0.3090; THP-1, t (14) = 2.798, p = 0.0142; HDFn, t (14) = 3.761, p = 0.0021.

Crude
extracts of AM gave the highest cytotoxic efficacy toward
MCF-7 with a half maximal inhibitory concentration of 6.34 μg/mL,
which was followed by H69PR, HT-29, and THP-1 with IC50 values of 7.05, 9.10, and 67.22 μg/mL, respectively. Significant
differences for the degree of potency, as found in Tukey’s
post hoc multiple comparison, were found between almost all cell lines
(p < 0.05) except for the paired treatment of
MCF-7 versus H69PR, which was displayed to be statistically similar
(p > 0.05). Data subsets
of aforementioned cancer cell lines and Zeocin exhibited that the
paired treatments were comparable (p > 0.05).

There were no perceivable variances as found in the unpaired t test between the paired trials of AM versus Zeocin (p > 0.05) in MCF-7 trials. In fact, there was no significant
difference in the scores for mean values of AM (M = 53.02, SD = 5.71) and mean values for Zeocin (M = 58.69, SD = 5.67) conditions; t (14) = 0.7047, p = 0.4925. These results exhibited that the antiproliferative
actions of both AM and Zeocin were comparable.

Trials using
H69PR showed that the AM cytotoxic activity was comparable
to Zeocin displaying no significant differences between the two inhibitors
(p > 0.05) as found through an independent sample t test comparison. Results for the unpaired t test exhibited the mean values of AM (M = 52.02,
SD = 5.44) and mean values for Zeocin (M = 58.22,
SD = 6.54) conditions (t (14) = 0.7285, p = 0.4783).

Post hoc analysis revealed that there were no significant
differences
between the paired treatments (p > 0.05) of HT-29
of AM and Zeocin. The mean IC50 values of HT-29 cells treated
with AM (M = 49.16, SD = 7.27) and mean IC50 values of HT-29 cells treated with Zeocin (M =
60.38, SD = 7.75) were found not to have significant variance (t(14) = 1.056, p = 0.3090).

The global
or shared results of THP-1 with inhibitor trials reject
the null hypothesis and exemplifies that both data subsets are unique
(p < 0.05). Significant differences were seen
between the two inhibitors (p < 0.05), and the
results for the unpaired t test disclosed the values
of AM (M = 32.31, SD = 5.10) and for Zeocin (M = 61.67, SD = 9.17) conditions (t (14)
= 2.798, p = 0.0142).

AM was established to
be noncytotoxic to normal HDFn, with an IC50 value substantially
surpassing concentrations of 100 μg/mL.
Multiple comparisons of AM and immortalized cell line examinations
confirmed that there were significant differences and, the null hypothesis
(one curve for all datasets) was rejected (log IC50 the
same for all datasets) as verified by the goodness of fit of the two
alternative nested models (IC50) between separate experiments, F (4, 80) = 445.2, p < 0.0001, and to
the discrepancies amid the dose–response diagrams F (4, 35) = 4.176, p = 0.0072. Similarly, pertaining
to their respective IC50 results, trials with aberrant
cell lines treated with Zeocin were found to not be significantly
disparate (p > 0.05). Zeocin, a known cytotoxic
agent,
gave IC50 values of 3.37, 3.83, 3.78, 3.59, and 4.08 ppm
in MCF-7, H69PR, HT-29, THP-1, and HDFn, respectively. Multiple comparisons
showed negative noteworthy variances in the trials (p > 0.05). Post hoc comparison of the dose–response curve
fits
for the aberrant cell line treatments exhibited no significant differences
(Figures 4 and 5).

At present, only the sulforhodamine B (SRB)
colorimetric assays
for cytotoxicity screening were done on the bark or outer covering
of roots but not on A. macrophylla tree bark. Results
from the literature stated that indole derivatives found in the rhizome
outer covering of A. macrophylla had antiproliferative
action (using the SRB assay) on MOR-P and COR-L23 carcinomas because
of the bisindole component.26O-Acetylmacralstonine, villalstonine, and macrocarpamine were also
established to influence definite actions on normal mammary fibroblasts,
as well as on these specific immortalized cancers: StMl1 1a (skin
cancer), Caki-2 (kidney cancer), MCF-7 (breast cancer), and LS174T
(colon cancer) with IC50 values ranging 2–10 μM.26 Another work showed that methanolic extracts
of root barks containing O-methylmacralstonine, talcarpine,
villalstonine, pleiocarpamine, and macraistonine exhibited high cytotoxicity
on MOR-P and COR-L23.27

2.5 Inhibitory sPLA2 Activity of AM
The sPLA2 action of 100 ppm N. philippinensis (NPV)
was examined with the potential inhibitor AM. Plant extracts
ranging from 1 to 1000 μg/mL (seven dilutions) were established
in the presence of 100 μg/mL Philippine cobra venom. Percent
inhibition brought about by the inhibitors was determined and established
on the computed sPLA2 activities.

The AM bark showed
inhibitory phospholipase activity as shown by the IC50 concentration
of 297.27 ± 9.33 μg/mL (Figure 6). An alkaloid found in the Solanaceae family,
atropine, was discovered to impede the venom of Daboia russelli.28 Phytochemical compounds, coumestan
and steroids (β-sitosterol and stigmasterol) extracted from
the alcoholic rhizome preparations of Pluchea indica bypassed oxidative degradation of lipids and superoxide dismutase
action stimulated through envenoming.29 Lupeol moderately prevented the hemorrhage, edema, procoagulant,
and myotoxic events caused by Bothrops venom.30 These aforementioned constituents could be the
cause for the observed N. philippinensis antivenom
activity, which solicits further studies.

Figure 6 Linear regression analysis
of the variation in absorbance (ΔA414) as the
slope (top) and inhibitory outcome of AM in
contradiction of sPLA2 activity from NPV (bottom).

A member of the same genus, A. scholaris (AAS)
aqueous solution was found to significantly neutralize Vipera
russelli venom (VRV) stimulating an increase in serum alanine
transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and creatinine in Swiss albino
animal models incubated with VRV (0.5 and 1 μg)
and AAS concoction (200 mg/kg).31 The water decoction of AAS inhibited VRV minimum lethal action,
minimum edema activity, minimal defibrinogenating activity, and minimum
necrotizing action in mice weighing approximately 18–20 g.32

In this work, AM bark was found to be
an efficient antioxidant,
the assessment of the effectiveness of AM on the four immortalized
cancer cell lines revealed that the integrity of MCF-7, H69PR, and
HT-29 consistently decreased in all the trials, and the action of
cytotoxicity was analogous to the positive control Zeocin. For the
most part, trials observed in the mutant cell lines indicated low
half maximal inhibitory concentrations (<7 μg/mL), which
were acquired for all of the trials. MCF-7 was highly responsive to
AM, while the least responsive to AM was THP-1. Wild-type HDFn trials
incubated with AM were substantiated to be noncytotoxic and gave half
maximal inhibitory concentrations of greater than 100 μg/mL,
whereas Zeocin-treated normal cells reached their half maximal inhibitory
concentrations at less than 5.00 μg/mL. The results of this
work on the crude MEOH/DMSO extracts from A. macrophylla, which consisted primarily of alkaloids and triterpenoids, could
be the rationale for further development of this preparation, through
additional bioassays, as a candidate for chemotherapeutic drugs or
as a supplementation in the management of human colorectal cancer,
human breast adenocarcinoma, and human small cell lung carcinoma.
AM bark has shown in vitro prohibitory events against sPLA2 granting that there has been no preceding information of this phenomenon.
NPV neutralization by constituents of AM bark or in combination therapy
with antivenom serum could be suitable inhibitors to the enzymatic
toxins from snake envenoming.

3 Materials
and Methods
3.1 Sample Preparation Protocol
The outer
coverings of A. macrophylla trunks were gathered
in Mariveles, Bataan, Philippines and was identified by Virgilio Linis,
a botanist from the Biology Department, De La Salle University. The
bark was ground followed by soaking ∼3.0 g of the powdered
biomass in 20 mL of dichloromethane (DCM) for 3 h. Extracts were filtered
and then dried under nitrogen for 1 h. The crude extract yielded approximately
0.7 g. Powdered biomass of each species was soaked in a polar extraction
solvent to target the isolation of phenolic acids. This solution was
made up of a 50:50 MeOH/DMSO ratio according to the method used by
Harukaze et al.19

3.2 GC–EI-MS
Parameters
Crude
extracts from both solvents were scrutinized by GC–EI-MS. An
Agilent GC MS 7890B, equipped with a HP-5 ms (5% phenyl methylsiloxane)
Ultra Inert column (30 m × 250 mm × 0.25 mm) with ultrapure
helium gas as the mobile phase, was employed for the analysis of low-boiling-point
components. Helium gas was delivered at 1 mL/min, while maintaining
pressure at 8.2 psi, with a rate of 36.62 cm/s and holdup interval
of 1.37 min. The splitless inlet was held at 250 °C, at 8.2 psi,
and an overall stream of 24 mL/min, with a septum purge stream velocity of 3 mL/min. The temperature
for the injector was stipulated at 250 °C. The temperature program
started at 70 °C with a programmed linear ramp of 2 °C/min
until 135 °C and was held at this temperature for 10 min. Another
temperature increase was achieved at 4 °C/min until 220 °C
and was maintained for 10 min. The temperature was then increased
to 270 °C at a ramp of 3.5 °C/min and was held at 37 min.

Compound identification was done using the NIST Archive 2.0, and
percent peak area average was calculated from the subsequent total
ion chromatograms (TIC). The consequential results were authenticated
by the evaluation of the constituents corresponding to their elution
succession with their comparative retention indices on a midpolar
column. The retention indices were processed for the identified analytes
utilizing a sequence of n-alkanes. All tests were
performed in triplicate.

3.3 EDX Analysis
Dehydrated
samples of
AM bark were prepared in a 10 mm Mylar cup for elemental analysis
using an EDX-7000 with a collimator set at 10 mm under vacuum.

3.4 Antioxidant Assay
The antioxidant
potential of protonated AM leaf methanolic preparations was measured
by an adapted DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) protocol of Viturro
et al.20 Approximately ∼0.5 g of
powdered biomass of each species was added to 1 mL of an extraction
solvent made up of 7.0 mL of MeOH, 2.95 mL of H2O, and
0.05 mL of HCl. The biomass was soaked for 3 h and was filtered to
yield approximately ∼50 mg of crude extract. Samples were then
dried under nitrogen gas for 2 h.

The DPPH mixture (0.2 mM)
was formulated by diluting 3.94 mg of DPPH in 50 mL of methanol. An
initial solution of AM was prepared at 4 mg of crude extract in 1
mL of methanol. The blank was made with 1 mL of this solution in addition
to 1 mL of methanol. One mL of the 4 mg/mL stock was added to a 10
mL test tube along with 1 mL of the 0.2 mM DPPH solution. A total
of eight concentrations from 17.5 to 0.27 mg/mL were made by serial
dilution. The absorbances were read at 515 nm (UV–vis Shimadzu
2900) after samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min.
IC50 is defined as the sample concentration at which 50%
of the free radicals are removed. This is determined by calculating
the DPPH free radical scavenging percentages. This is computed by
the formula: 1  

3.5 Cell
Viability Assay
The pharmacognosy
of the dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) extracts from
AM was tested on the succeeding immortalized cell lines purchased
from ATCC, Manassas, Virginia, USA (breast cancer (MCF-7), colon cancer
(HT- 29), small cell lung carcinoma (H69PR), human acute monocytic
leukemia (THP-1)) and a primary culture of normal human dermal fibroblast
neonatal (HDFn) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Gibco, USA). Culture and
maintenance were done in DMEM (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium
and 10% fetal bovine serum with 1× antibiotic–antimycotic)
(Thermo Fisher, Invitrogen, USA) and were incubated at 37 °C
with 5% CO2 and 95% humidity.

The cytotoxic activities
of the AM extracts were determined using the PrestoBlue viability
assay. The protocol detects viable cells by virtue of actively present
mitochondrial reductases that metabolically reduce the resazurin dye
(nonfluorescent blue) to resorufin (highly fluorescent red). The 96
well culture plates were measured at 570 nm to measure the resorufin
produced, which was correlated to the number of viable cells.

Cells passaged in wells with viable counts of 1.0 × 104 cells/mL in each well were allowed to form monolayers overnight,
except for THP-1 that are nonadherent cells. After overnight incubation,100,
50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.12, 1.56, and 0.78 μg/mL solutions of
AM extracts were introduced into the wells. After 72 h, 10 μL
of PrestoBlue was placed in the trials. Further incubation was done
for 1 h to allow optimal reactions to take place. Wells with no AM
added served as negative untreated controls, and wells with Zeocin
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Gibco, USA) served as the positive control.
Zeocin, which is a DNA intercalating antibiotic of the bleomycin/phleomycin
family, is cytotoxic to cells growing aerobically from 0.5 to 1000
μg/mL. Spectrophotometry was carried out using a BioTek ELx800.
Optical density (O.D.) values were ascertained to derive percent cell
viability following the equation below: 2  

Nonlinear regression and statistical
analyses were achieved using
the software GraphPad Prism 7. The IC50 (inhibitor concentration
leading to 50% reduction of cell viability) was also inferred from
nonlinear regression analysis. All trials were performed in three
replicates and are shown as mean ± SEM. The Brown–Forsythe
analysis (F test) was utilized to discern the variances
in the best-fit parameters and dose–response curve fits. One-way
ANOVA (p < 0.05) was accomplished to clarify disparities
between datasets, in conjunction with Tukey’s post hoc test
(p < 0.05).

3.6 In Vitro
Inhibitory sPLA2 Activity
The inhibitory effects
of AM (MeOH/DMSO) extracts were determined
against northern Philippine Cobra or Naja philippinensis Taylor (NPV) venom sPLA2 using the Secretory Phospholipase
A2 Assay Kit (Cat. No. ab133089). The following reagents
were used and formulated according to the manufacturer’s instructions:
assay buffer (10×), 5,5′-dithio-bis-(2-nitro-benzoic acid)
(DTNB), diheptanoyl thio-PC substrate, bee venom (control), and a
96 well polystyrene F-bottom clear microplate.

The venoms and
AM were reconstituted in methanol or DMSO to achieve a 100 mg/mL concentration,
which was serially diluted to1000 to 1 ppm. The blank was composed
of 5 μL of DMSO, 10 μL of DTNB, and 10 μL of assay
buffer, while the positive control contained 5 μL of DMSO, 10
μL of DTNB, and 10 μL of NPV. The experimental wells included
5 μL of AM inhibitor in DMSO, 10 μL of DTNB, and 10 μL
of NPV. After addition of 200 μL of diheptanoyl thio-PC substrate
into each well, absorbance was read at 414 nm using a Corona Electric
Multimode Microplate Reader (MTP-800). Percent inhibition was verified
based on the determined sPLA2 inhibition. In addition,
the concentration of AM generating 50% inhibition (IC50) was stated. 3  

Here, Xcontrol is the sPLA2 activity of positive control (100 μg/L
NPV) and Xsample is the sPLA2 activity in the presence
of inhibitor (AM). The absorbance values were corrected against the
blank sample (DMSO).
