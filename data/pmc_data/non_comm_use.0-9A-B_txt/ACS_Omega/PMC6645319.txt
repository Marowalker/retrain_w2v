The overexpression of α-synuclein
(α-syn) and its aggregation
is the hallmark of Parkinson’s disease. The α-syn aggregation
results in the formation of Lewy bodies that causes neuronal cell
death. Therefore, the small molecules that can protect neuronal cells
from α-syn toxicity or inhibit the aggregation of α-syn
could emerge as anti-Parkinson agents. Herein, a library of methoxy-stilbenes
was screened for their ability to restore the cell growth from α-syn
toxicity, using a yeast strain that stably expresses two copies of
a chromosomally integrated human α-syn gene. Tetramethoxy-stilbene 4s, a nonantioxidant, was the most capable of restoring cell
growth. It also rescues the more toxic cells that bear three copies
of wild-type or A53T-mutant α-syn, from cell growth block. Its
EC50 values for growth restoration of the 2-copy wild-type
and the 3-copy mutant α-syn strains are 0.95 and 0.35 μM,
respectively. Stilbene 4s mitigates mitochondrial membrane
potential loss, negates ROS production, and prevents nuclear DNA-fragmentation,
all hallmarks of apoptosis. However, 4s does not rescue
cells from the death-inducing effects of Bax and βA4, which
suggest that 4s specifically inhibits α-syn-mediated
toxicity in the yeast. Our results signify that simultaneous use of
multiple yeast-cell-based screens can facilitate revelation of compounds
that may have the potential for further investigation as anti-Parkinson’s
agents.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Parkinson’s
disease (PD) is caused by the loss of neuronal
cells in the brain which leads to a reduction in dopamine that plays
a vital role in regulating the body movement. The manifestations of
PD include bradykinesia (slow movement), postural instability, muscular
rigidity, and resting tremors. The overexpression of α-synuclein
(α-syn) and βA4 proteins causes accumulation of aggregated
or mis-folded proteins which are thought to be the key to the pathogenesis
of PD and Alzheimer’s disease. Aggregation results in the formation
of insoluble α-syn and βA4 deposits, referred to as Lewy
bodies that lead to neuronal cell death (i.e., neuronal apoptosis).1 Gene duplication, multiplication of the α-syn
gene locus,2 and point mutations in the
α-syn gene that incorporate single amino acid changes, such
as Ala53Thr (A53T), lead to overexpression of the 140-amino acid α-syn
protein.3 Proteolytic cleavage of the precursor
amyloid precursor protein releases the 42-amino acid βA4 peptide
which is overproduced, mainly because of genetic reasons, in individuals
suffering from Alzheimer’s disease.4 The expression of human α-syn in the baker’s yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, results in the accumulation
of ROS followed by the manifestation of apoptosis.5S. cerevisiae has also been
used to target a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged βA4
peptide to yeast’s secretory pathway, with the help of a signal
sequence upstream of the βA4-GFP fusion gene. The secreted βA4
fusion protein manifests toxicity in yeast.6 A number of studies have now confirmed that yeast is a suitable
system for studying the pathogenesis of both human α-syn and
βA4.5,7

Bax is a proapoptotic protein that
belongs to the Bcl-2 family.8 It manifests
its apoptotic function when bound
to mitochondrial membranes.9 It is very
likely that Bax has a much broader role than α-syn in neuronal
cell death and plays a major part in the overall regulation of neurodegenerative
processes that lead to neuronal apoptosis.10 More specifically, in a mouse model of PD, Bax takes part in the
destruction of neurons that produce dopamine. Hence, it has been suggested
that down-regulation of Bax can be an attractive and novel therapeutic
target for restricting the progression of PD.11 In the yeast S. cerevisiae, the expression
of Bax also generates ROS which precedes apoptosis that is prevented
by the anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL.12 This is similar to what has been observed in
mammalian cells.13

We have cloned
the gene coding for the human proteins α-syn,
its more toxic A53T mutant, Bax and βA4, under the control of
the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter, in plasmids that allow integration
of gene expression cassettes at chromosomal locations of a yeast strain
(i.e., W303-1a; ATCC 208352), via homologous recombination.14 The human α-syn and the mutant A53T α-syn
were cloned in such a way that one to three copies of the gene could
stably be expressed from yeast chromosomes. For human βA4, yeast
strains were constructed that allow secretion of the peptide from
one copy or two copies of the gene. We have observed that, with the
increase of gene dosage or copy number (i.e., from one copy to two
or three copies), the toxicity manifested by α-syn and βA4
also increases. The human Bax protein was expressed only from a single
chromosomally integrated gene where it showed enough toxicity to stop
cell growth and induce cell death. The two-copy wild-type α-syn
expressing yeast strain was used for the initial screening of a chemical
library of methoxy-stilbenes, to identify compounds which can overcome
the α-syn protein toxicity.

Because deposition of α-syn
as neuronal inclusions, synonymous
to Lewy bodies, is likely to be the causative agent of the disease
suffered by most PD patients,15 targeting
toxicity manifested by α-syn overexpression is considered an
important approach for discovering new anti-PD drugs.16 Reported inhibitors of α-syn aggregation include
N-methylated derivatives of peptides from the α-syn protein
sequence,17 single-chain antibodies,18 small-molecule antioxidant compounds such as
curcumin,19 epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG),20 and 8-hydroxyquinolines.21 A large number of naturally occurring polyphenolic compounds
also have been reported to inhibit the aggregation of α-syn
and prevent its toxicity.22 Among these
polyphenols, the antioxidant stilbenes23 viz. resveratrol (1), piceatannol (2),
and 2,3,5,4′-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-d-glucoside (TSG, 3) have been shown to inhibit
α-syn aggregation, although it has never been shown that these
compounds can overcome α-syn’s toxicity in yeast, perhaps
because of their relatively low permeability across the yeast cell
wall. Guo et al.24 have reported that resveratrol
ameliorates motor deficits and pathological changes in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated
mice via activation of SIRT1 and subsequent LC3 deacetylation-mediated
autophagic degradation of α-syn. Another phenolic stilbene,
piceatannol, a constituent of vine, inhibits the formation of α-syn
fibrils by destabilizing preformed filaments.25 The glycosylated stilbene (TSG, 3, Figure 1A), extracted from Polygonum multiflorum, inhibits α-syn aggregation
and apoptosis in A53T mutant α-syn-transfected cells.26

In the present paper, the in silico-designed series of methoxy-stilbenes
were synthesized and studied for their ability to protect yeast cells
from α-syn mediated toxicity. The tetramethoxy stilbene 4s (IIIM-959) was identified as the unique compound, which
is a nonantioxidant, and rescues the more toxic cells that bear 3-copies
of wild-type or A53T-mutant α-syn, from cell growth block. However,
it does not rescue cells from the death-inducing effects of Bax and
βA4. The effect of 4s on inhibition of α-syn
aggregation was also studied. The results are presented in this paper.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Design and Synthesis of
Methoxy-Stilbenes
The structure of the α-syn monomer27 and its fibrils28 has been studied by
several groups. Preclinical studies have shown that the α-syn
fibrils cause Parkinson-like neurodegeneration in nontransgenic mice
models.29 Furthermore, recently Mach and
co-workers30 have shown that small molecules
binds to various pockets of the β-sheet structure (residue K34
to K97) of α-syn fibrils which is rich in hydrophobic residues;
thus it was speculated that methoxystilbenes would display strong
interactions with the β-sheet structure. Thus, a series of mono-,
di-, tri-, and tetramethoxy-stilbenes were synthesized as depicted
in Figure 1B. The synthesis
involved Wittig reaction of aryl aldehydes 6 with phosphine
salts 7 in the presence of potassium tert-butoxide under anhydrous conditions. The aldehydes which are not
commercially available were synthesized by Vilsmeier–Haack
reaction. Using the synthetic scheme as shown in Figure 1B, the stilbenes 4a–4ac were obtained in excellent yields. A total of 29 stilbenes were
prepared and were characterized by NMR and MS analysis.

2.2 Construction of Yeast Strains That Contain
One Copy, Two Copies, and Three Copies of the Human α-Syn Gene
At first, the plasmids were constructed that allow the expression
of 1-copy and 2- and 3-copies of the α-syn gene in the yeast.
A BglII-XbaI fragment of the coding sequence of the human α-syn
gene [NCBI Accession # NM_000345.3], containing a 3′-end
DNA sequence that codes for the HA-tag peptide (consisting of the
nine amino acid residues YPYDVPDYA),31 was
isolated from a human hippocampal cDNA library (BioCat) by PCR and
was cloned in yeast integration vectors downstream of the GAL1 promoter
[Saccharomyces Genome Database ID S000000224]
and upstream of the SUC2 gene terminator signal [Saccharomyces Genome Database ID S000001424]. The GAL1 promoter is repressed in
the presence of glucose and induced in the presence of the sugar and
galactose. After cloning of the HA-tagged wild-type α-syn gene
in appropriate yeast integrative vectors, the following plasmids were
obtained: YIpTRP1Gal1p/α-syn-HA, YIpHIS3Gal1p/α-syn-HA,
and YIpURA3Gal1p/α-syn-HA (Figure 2). These plasmids contain the α-syn
gene sandwiched between the GAL1 promoter and the SUC2 terminator
signal and allow integration of one copy, two copies, and three copies
of the α-syn gene into chromosomal locations where the auxotrophic
markers, TRP1, HIS3, and URA3 genes, reside on the yeast genome.

Figure 2 Three integrative plasmids
used to introduce HA-tagged human α-syn
gene expression cassettes, under the control of the GAL1 promoter,
into three different chromosomal locations (i.e., where the TRP1,
HIS3, and URA3 genes lie) of the yeast genome. The arrows show the
restriction sites at which the plasmids were linearized for genomic
(i.e., chromosomal) integration via homologous recombination.14

The basic yeast strain used for integration was W303-1a (Mata, ade2, his3, leu2, trp1, ura3) (ATCC
#208352). Herein, it is referred to as BC300. The yeast strain obtained
after integration of the plasmid YIpTRP1Gal1p/α-syn-HA in BC300
was named BC300::α-syn-HA(TRP1); it contained a single copy
of the α-syn gene integrated at the TRP1 chromosomal
locus. The plasmid YIpHIS3Gal1p/α-syn-HA was integrated into
the strain BC300::α-syn-HA(TRP1) to obtain the strain BC300::α-syn-HA(TRP1),
α-syn-HA(HIS3); it contained two copies of the α-syn gene
integrated at the TRP1 and HIS3 chromosomal
loci. The plasmid YIpURA3Gal1p/α-syn-HA was integrated into
the strain BC300::α-syn-HA(TRP1), α-syn-HA(HIS3) to obtain
the strain BC300::α-syn-HA(TRP1), α-syn-HA(HIS3), α-syn-HA(URA3);
it contained three copies of the α-syn gene integrated at the TRP1, HIS3 and URA3 chromosomal
loci. To generate negative controls, the strain BC300 was integrated
with empty vectors (i.e., basic integrating vectors which do not contain
the α-syn gene) in three successive steps to obtain the three
strains: (a) BC300::—(TRP1); (b) BC300::—(TRP1), —(HIS3);
and (c) BC300::—(TRP1), —(HIS3), —(URA3); they
contain one copy, two copies, and three copies of an empty plasmid
at the (i) TRP1, (ii) TRP1&HIS3, and (iii) TRP1, HIS3&URA3 chromosomal loci, respectively.

2.3 Growth of Yeast Strains That Contain (a) Two
and Three Copies of the Human α-Syn Gene and (b) Two and Three
Copies of Empty Plasmids, on Sold Agar Minimal Medium Plates, Containing
Glucose or Galactose
Four clones from each of the three strains
BC300::α-syn-HA(TRP1), BC300::α-syn-HA(TRP1), α-syn-HA(HIS3),
and BC300::α-syn-HA(TRP1), α-syn-HA(HIS3), α-syn-HA(URA3),
containing 1-copy, 2-copies, and 3-copies of the human α-syn
gene, respectively, were streaked out on solid agar synthetic minimal
medium plates that contained either galactose (SG) or glucose (SD)
as the carbon source. Cells were grown at 30 °C for 96 h. In
galactose-containing medium, the α-syn gene is induced by the
GAL1 promoter and, hence, the protein must be produced, whereas in
glucose, the α-syn protein should not be produced because the
gene expression is repressed. The strains (a) BC300::—(TRP1),(b)
BC300::—(TRP1), —(HIS3), and (c) BC300::—(TRP1),
—(HIS3), —(URA3) [containing one copy, two copies, and
three copies of empty plasmids that do not contain the α-syn
gene] were used as negative controls. The results show that expression
of 1-copy, 2-copies, and 3-copies of the α-syn gene from different
chromosomal loci block the growth of cells in galactose, but not in
glucose. Control strains containing 1-copy, 2-copies, and 3-copies
of empty plasmids grow, as expected, both in SG and SD media (Figure 3A–F). It was
inferred that the human α-syn protein must be toxic to the yeast,
as has been reported earlier.32 Cells were
grown in minimal SG liquid medium containing galactose. Total cellular
proteins were obtained via lysis of cells, and they were examined
for the expression of the human α-syn protein. Western blot
results show that the levels of α-syn protein, expressed in
the yeast increase as the copy number increases from 1 to 3 (Figure 3G). This would suggest
that manifestation of α-syn protein’s toxicity (i.e.,
block in cell growth) would increase with the increasing copy number
from 1-copy to 2- and 3-copies of the α-syn gene.

was probed with an antibody that recognizes the HA epitope (Proteintech,
51064-2-AP) and the lower panel with a β-actin antibody (Proteintech,
60008-1-Ig); levels of β-actin were used as a loading control,
β-actin being a housekeeping gene. (H) Growth of yeast strains

Around 200 cells were counted in each field; (J) comparing the MMP

and three copies of α-syn compared with strains than contain
empty plasmids. Cells were stained with dihydroethdium to detect ROS.35b The data represent mean ± SD of three

in yeast strains which express one copy, two copies, and three copies
of α-syn, using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP

empty plasmids.35b The data represent mean
± SD of three independent experiments. For all four sets of analyses
(I–L), cells were cultured for 20 h in galactose, for induction
of α-syn protein expression, before treatment of cells, as required
by the assay [statistical analysis was performed in (I–L) for
comparison between the 1C, 2C, and 3C α-syn with the respective
control group, ***p < 0.01].

Cell growth of the strains (a) BC300::α-syn(TRP1),
(b) BC300::α-syn(TRP1),
α-syn(HIS3), and (c) BC300::α-syn(TRP1), α-syn(HIS3),
α-syn(URA3) containing one copy, two copies, and three copies
of the human α-syn gene, was compared in minimal liquid SG medium
containing galactose (Figure 3H). The graphs show that the strains containing 1-copy, 2-copies,
and 3-copies of the human α-syn gene do not grow in SG liquid
medium, whereas the strains containing the empty plasmids do grow
in the same medium. The strains were grown at 30 °C over a period
of 48 h in liquid culture. The results again indicate that the human
α-syn gene, when expressed in a galactose-containing yeast cell
culture medium, completely blocks cell growth. The strain BC300::α-syn(TRP1),
containing a single copy of the α-syn gene, was not used any
further in these studies. Although the expression of a single copy
also blocked cell growth on agar plates, it was clear from Figure 3G that the BC300::α-syn(TRP1)
expressed the least amount of α-syn protein.

To identify
compounds in a screen of a library of methoxy-stilbenes,
we wished to identify a compound that would overcome the maximum levels
of toxicity mediated by α-syn, in yeast cells. Hence, it was
thought that yeast strains which express 2-copies and 3-copies of
the α-syn gene may be more appropriate for screening of chemical
libraries to see if compounds could be identified that would overcome
cell growth. Before embarking on such a screen, it was necessary to
clarify the levels of cell death that the newly constructed yeast
strains undergo, upon the expression of human α-syn. Cells,
after the expression of α-syn in galactose, were treated with
the dye Phloxine B which stains dead cells red.33 The percentage of cell death, in the one- to three-copy
α-syn expressing strains and the corresponding empty strains
(i.e., cells which do not harbor the α-syn gene), is shown in Figure 3I. Increasing cell
death was observed with the increasing α-syn copy number. Next,
the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in yeast cells
expressing one copy, two copies, and three copies of human α-syn
was assessed. It has been suggested that α-syn aggregation causes
mitochondrial dysfunction and thereby affects MMP34 which allows release of ROS35 that leads to neuronal apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death.
It was, therefore, necessary to find out if these newly constructed
α-syn-expressing yeast strains suffer from loss of MMP, generate
ROS, and undergo apoptosis. Yeast strains expressing one copy, two
copies, and three copies of α-syn do show gradual loss of MMP
with the increasing copy number (Figure 3J). Concomitantly, yeast strains expressing
one copy, two copies, and three copies of α-syn generate increasing
levels of ROS with the copy number increase (Figure 3K). It was also seen that the three-copy
α-syn-bearing cells undergo the most nuclear DNA fragmentation
which mirrors the degree of apoptosis, that is, the two-copy and one-copy
strains suffer less apoptosis than the three-copy strain (Figure 3L).35

2.4 Screening of the Methoxy-Stilbene
Library
in the Two-Copy Wild-Type α-Syn Strain
The 29-compound
chemically synthesized methoxy-stilbene library was screened using
a yeast strain that expresses two copies of HA-tagged human α-syn
from chromosomal loci. Compounds, at 10 μM concentration in
5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), were incubated at 30 °C with two-copy
α-syn-expressing cells in minimal SG medium (that contained
2% galactose and 0.2% glucose) in 96-well microtiter plates. The plates
were shaken at 200 rpm for 72 h. The growth of cells (measured by
monitoring the optical density of cells at 600 nm; OD600), in the absence of compounds but in the presence of 5% DMSO, was
used as the base for calculating the percentage growth in the presence
of compounds. The results are shown in Table 1. We have used another chemical library consisting
of 20 “quinazolinones”36 to
show that one does not obtain “hits” in this yeast-based
α-syn screen from any chemical library. One may refer to this
as a negative control for such a screen. Results are shown in the Supporting Information, Section S1. The five
best compounds 4f, 4q, 4r, 4s, and 4u that rescue growth of the two-copy
α-syn expressing yeast cells, in liquid culture, also rescue
growth of the same cells on solid agar plates (Supporting Information, Section S2).

Table 1 Rescue
from the Block in the Growth
of Yeast Cells That Express Two Copies of α-Syn, by Methoxy-Stilbenes,
at 10 μM Concentration
a The data represent
mean ± SD
of four independent experiments.

2.5 Yeast Cells Expressing One to Three Copies
of the A53T α-Syn Mutant Protein Block Cell Growth and Induce
Cell Death
The hits identified in the yeast strain that expresses
two copies of α-syn were further tested for their cell rescuing
ability in strains that express three copies of wild type α-syn,
and also three copies of mutant α-syn (A53T); the plasmids encoding
the A53T mutant α-syn gene are shown in Section S3 of the Supporting Information. The A53T amino acid change
in the primary protein sequence of α-syn is the result of a
familial mutation in the α-syn DNA sequence that is linked to
PD.37 It has been claimed that it is the
most amyloidogenic α-syn mutant protein, implying that it is
also more prone to aggregation than the other known α-syn mutants.
Hence, it has been predicted to be the most toxic among all α-syn
protein variants. Similar to the wild type α-syn protein, the
expression of the A53T mutant blocks yeast cell growth in solid agar
and liquid culture media that contain galactose (Figure 4A–G). Again, similar
to wild type α-syn, expression of one to three copies of the
A53T α-syn mutant induces cell death after the growth of cells,
for 20 h, in liquid culture medium containing galactose (Figure 4H). Cell death increases
with the copy number.

Figure 4 (A–F), Growth of yeast cells harboring one copy,
two copies,
and three copies of the human α-syn (A53T) gene, on minimal
medium solid agar plates that contained either glucose (SD) or galactose
(SG). Panels (A–F), upper half (4 clones): strains containing
one copy, two copies, or three copies of the α-syn(A53T) gene,

(A–F), lower half (4 clones): strains containing an empty plasmid
or empty plasmids, without any α-syn (A53T) gene. The solid

strains that contain one copy, two copies, or three copies of the

of three independent experiments. (H) Percentage of cells undergoing
death in yeast strains expressing one copy, two copies, and three
copies of α-syn (A53T), after cells were cultured for 20 h in
SG medium. Dead cells were stained with Phloxine B. The data represent
mean ± SD of five independent fields of observation (statistical
significance, ***p < 0.01). Around 200 cells were
counted in each field. (I) Rescue from the block in growth of yeast
cells that express (a) three copies of wild-type α-syn(wt) [3C-α-syn(wt)]
and (b) three copies of mutant α-syn(A53T) [3C-α-syn(A53T)],
by methoxy-stilbenes, at 10 μM concentration. This is compared
with the growth that had been seen in the two-copy wild-type α-syn
strain. The data represent mean ± SD of four independent experiments.

All 29 compounds in the methoxy-stilbene
library were separately
tested, at 10 μM concentration, in the strains that express
(a) three copies of wild-type α-syn(wt) [i.e., 3C-α-syn(wt)]
and (b) three copies of mutant α-syn(A53T) [i.e., 3C-α-syn(A53T)].
Cells were incubated, at 30 °C, in the presence or absence of
compounds, in 96-well plates in SG medium (that contained 2% galactose
and 0.2% glucose); the plates were shaken at 200 rpm. It was observed
that the compounds, which had been identified in the screen using
the two-copy wild-type α-syn strain, also restore cell growth
in these two new strains, in the presence of 2% galactose and 0.2%
glucose (Figure 4I).
Percentage growth was again calculated based on the growth of the
respective cells in galactose (SG medium) and in the presence of only
5% DMSO, but no compound, which was considered as zero percent or
base line. It should be noted that the cells expressing three copies
of α-syn and three copies of the mutant A53T α-syn hardly
grew in SG, over 72 h, compared to the strain that expresses two copies
of α-syn which had been used for the initial screen. This may
be one of the reasons why the calculated percentage growth appears
to be relatively higher, for some of the compounds, in the three-copy
wild-type α-syn and mutant α-syn strains than the strain
bearing two-copy wild-type α-syn. The two compounds, 4f and 4s, proved to be the best in rescuing growth of
three-copy α-syn expressing yeast cells, in liquid culture (Figure 4I). They also rescued
growth of the same cells on solid agar plates (Supporting Information, Section S4).

2.6 Determination
of EC50 Values of
Selected Methoxy-Stilbenes That Restore Growth in α-Syn-Expressing
Yeast Cells
We have determined the EC50 values
of the five compounds which restored growth the best, in liquid culture
and on solid agar, in cells blocked in growth by expression of two
copies of wild-type α-syn. For determination of EC50 values, cells were grown for 48 h at 30 °C, in the presence
of different concentrations of compounds in wells of 6-well plates.
The OD600 values were plotted against compound concentrations
to calculate the EC50 values. Results are shown in Table 2. The EC50 value for compound 4s, in the strain expressing three
copies of A53T mutant α-syn, which has been found to be the
most toxic among α-syn variants,38 was determined to be 0.35 μM.

2.7 Methoxy-Stilbenes 4q, 4r, and 4s Prevent Cell Death
and Restore Life in Cells
Expressing α-Syn
The three best compounds, 4q, 4r, and 4s, identified in the initial
screen of the methoxy-stilbene library using the two-copy wild-type
α-syn-bearing yeast strain, were then tested for their ability
to prevent cell death and also restore life in yeast cells which express
three copies of α-syn; the reason for choosing the three-copy
strain was because it manifests more toxicity than the two-copy cells
(see Figure 5).

Figure 5 Effect of three
best compounds, 4q, 4r, and 4s, which restore cell growth in the two-copy
α-syn screen, on α-syn-induced cell death. Cells, harboring
three copies of α-syn, were grown in SG minimal medium, containing
galactose, for 20 h at 30 °C, before further treatment with Phloxine
B or Hoechst 3342 dye. (A) Cells grown in the absence or presence
of compounds, 4q, 4r, and 4s stained with Phloxine B. (B) Percentage of dead cells in the absence
of any compound and in the presence of the three compounds, 4q, 4r, and 4s. The data represent
mean ± SD of five independent fields of observation (statistical
significance, ***p < 0.01). Around 150 cells were
counted in each field. (C) Cells stained with the Hoechst 33342 dye.
The upper two panels are the controls showing that most cells are
alive in glucose-containing SD medium (because there is no α-syn
expression), whereas they are dead in SG medium that contains galactose.
In the presence of compounds 4q, 4r, and 4s, cells grown in galactose-containing SG medium are resistant
to the toxic effects of α-syn. (D) Percentage of live cells,
in SG medium, in the absence of any compound and in the presence of
the three compounds, 4q, 4r, and 4s. The data represent mean ± SD of five independent fields of
observation (statistical significance, ***p <
0.01). In (D), the statistical significance was determined by comparison
of compound-treated live cells vs control cells containing galactose.

The results, obtained after treatment
of three-copy cells with
the compounds, are shown in Figure 5. Death of yeast cells, caused by the expression of
human α-syn, was visualized by staining with the dye, Phloxine
B. Dead cells are stained red. The observations (in Figure 5A,B) indicate that, in the
presence of the three compounds, 4q, 4r,
and 4s, there is a remarkable decrease in cell death
mediated by α-syn. In parallel, we show that the compounds provide
once again life to the cells which are being inflicted by the toxic
human α-syn by staining cells with the Hoechst 33342 dye (Figure 5C,D). The Hoechst
dye is used for fluorescent staining of DNA and nuclei of live cells,
including that of the yeast.39

2.8 Apoptosis Induced by the Expression of Human
α-Syn in Yeast Is Prevented by Treatment with Compounds 4q, 4r, and 4s
In eukaryotic
cells, ROS emanates from the mitochondrion, an intracellular compartment
responsible for respiration. Perpetual increase in the production
of ROS production, because of mitochondrial dysfunction, leads to
accumulation of ROS within cells which is likely to result in damage
of DNA, proteins, and lipids. This ROS-perpetrated damage prevents
proper functioning of the cells. It has been demonstrated that the
consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction and increase in ROS levels,
depending on the degree of ROS production and the loss of mitochondrial
function, is the induction of apoptosis.40 Mitochondrial dysfunction usually implies opening up the mitochondrial
permeability transition pore (mtPTP) which induces depolarization
of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential with attendant release
of apoptogenic factors and loss of mitochondria’s innate oxidative
phosphorylation capacity. The mtPTP has been recognized as a potential
pharmacological target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases,
like PD, in which excessive cell death occurs because of mitochondrial
dysfunction.41

The cellular toxicity
seen on the expression of human α-syn in mammalian cells has
precisely been reproduced in the baker’s yeast, S. cerevisiae.42 Yeast
cells, expressing human α-syn, do undergo apoptosis because
of oxidative stress originating from generation of excess ROS, triggered
by misfolding of α-syn, and accompanied by mitochondrial dysfunction.43 We show in Figure 6B that nuclear DNA fragmentation in three-copy
α-syn-bearing yeast cells is mostly abrogated by compounds 4q, 4r, and 4s. We then investigated
if the compounds, 4q, 4r, and 4s, would also mitigate loss of MMP and negate production of ROS. The
compounds indeed prevent MMP loss and increased levels of ROS formation
caused by expression of three copies of human α-syn in yeast
(Figure 6C,D).

Figure 6 Effect of the
three best compounds, 4q, 4r, and 4s, which restore cell growth in the two-copy
α-syn screen, on α-syn-induced nuclear DNA fragmentation
which occurs only in apoptotic cells. Cells, harboring three copies
of α-syn, were grown in SG minimal medium, containing galactose,
for 20 h at 30 °C, before assessing for nuclear DNA fragmentation
with the TUNEL assay. (A) Cells, grown in SG medium, in the absence
or presence of compounds, 4q, 4r, and 4s, which incorporate the fluorescence dye TF3 and modified
deoxyuridine 5′-triphosphate (TF3-dUTP) at the 3′-OH
ends of apoptotic DNA fragments. The uppermost panel shows that there
is hardly any DNA fragmentation in cells that do not express α-syn,
in the presence of glucose in contrast to cells which express α-syn,
in the presence of galactose. The levels of DNA fragmentation in cells
grown in galactose, in the presence of compounds, are much less than
in cells expressed in galactose, in the absence of compound. (B) Comparison
of the relative levels of nuclear DNA fragmentation in cells grown
in galactose, in the presence of compounds, with cells grown in the
absence of compounds, in galactose. Labeled DNA of cells which do
not express α-syn, in medium containing glucose, acted as a
positive control. DNA labeling is expressed as relative fluorescence
units (statistical significance, * 0.05 > p <
0.1). (C) Effect of the three best compounds, 4q, 4r, and 4s, on α-syn-induced loss of MMP
(statistical significance, *p < 0.25). (D) Effect
of the three best compounds, 4q, 4r, and 4s on α-syn-induced increase of levels of ROS in the
three-copy α-syn-expressing yeast cells (statistical significance,
***p < 0.01).

2.9 Antioxidant Activity of Identified Hits in
the 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2′-Azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic
Acid (ABTS) Assays
The antioxidant potential of selected
methoxy-stilbenes was evaluated in two assays that allow determination
of the compounds’ ability to scavenge free radicals generated
by (a) DPPH44 and (b) ABTS45 (Figure 7). Among the compounds identified as rescuers of human α-syn’s
toxicity in the yeast, only one compound, 4r, has some
antioxidant activity when compared with trolox, a vitamin E analogue.
None of the other methoxy-stilbenes seem to be antioxidants, although
resveratrol and piceatannol (on the basis of which the methoxy-stilbene
library was synthesized) have been found to be strong antioxidants
using the same DPPH and ABTS assays.23 We
have confirmed that resveratrol is an antioxidant in both the DPPH
and ABTS assays and piceatannol is an antioxidant in the ABTS assay
(Section S5, Supporting Information).

activity of methoxy-stilbenes at 10 μM concentration.
The antioxidant capacity of the compounds is compared with the standard
Trolox, a soluble vitamin E equivalent (also at 10 μM concentration).
(A) Antioxidant potential in the scavenging of the free radicals generated
by DPPH. The “Control” contained DPPH and 5% DMSO but
no compound. (B) Antioxidant potential in the scavenging of the free
radicals generated by ABTS. The antioxidant capacity of the compounds
is again compared with the standard Trolox. The “Control”
contained ABTS and 5% DMSO but no compound. The data in both (A,B)
represent mean ± SD of three independent experiments (statistical
significance, ns, p > 0.25).

2.10 Testing of Methoxy-Stilbenes for Rescue of
Human Bax-Expressing Yeast Cells
All 29 methoxy-stilbenes
were then tested in the yeast strain that expresses a single copy
of the human Bax gene with the aim of identifying compounds that may
overcome Bax-mediated block of cell growth and to see if there were
compounds that nullified the toxicity of both α-syn and Bax.
The synthetic Bax gene, synthesized on the basis of the published
protein sequence for Bax-α (NCBI Accession # AAA03619), was
cloned with a 3′-end DNA that codes for the c-myc tag (peptide sequence, EQKLISEEDL) in a yeast integrative plasmid
(see Section S6, Supporting Information). A chromosomally integrated copy of the human Bax gene in the yeast
strain BC300 (as described before) was expressed under the control
of the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter.12 Because the yeast cells that express Bax do not grow in galactose,
it would indicate that the expression of the Bax protein (Figure 8C) is toxic to the
yeast (Figure 8A,B).
The Bax expression also causes yeast cell death (Figure 8D). Bax-expressing yeast cells
were incubated in SG medium, at 30 °C, in the presence or absence
of compounds in 96-well plates; the plates were shaken at 200 rpm.
The results obtained in the screen of methoxy-stilbenes with Bax-expressing
yeast cells are summarized in Figure 8E.

Figure 8 (A) Solid agar plates depicting the growth of yeast cells
that
express human Bax protein and cells that do not contain Bax, in minimal
medium containing either glucose (SD) or galactose (SG). (B) Growth
of one set of clones from the strains, as in (A), in liquid minimal
medium containing galactose (SG); the OD600 values at each
time point represent the average of three independent experiments
(*P < 0.01; one-tailed Student’s t-test). (C) Western blot of total cellular proteins obtained
after lysis of cells that do not express Bax (BC300::—) and
do express c-myc-tagged Bax (BC300::Bax), probed
with a c-myc antibody (Thermo Scientific, MA 1-980),
and a β-actin antibody (Proteintech, 60008-1-Ig) as a loading
control, β-actin being a housekeeping gene. (D) Staining of
cells that express BC300::— and BC300::Bax, with Phloxine B,
under the fluorescent microscope. The left-hand panels show cells
in phase contrast microscopy. (E) Rescue from the block in growth
of yeast cells that express human Bax, by methoxy-stilbenes, at 10
μM. The data represent mean ± SD of four independent experiments
where optical density at 600 nm (OD600) was measured for
each cell culture.

Compound 4aa stands out because it rescues only Bax’s
toxicity in the yeast but not α-syn’s. It is possible
that it prevents cell death at a juncture, perhaps via a protein or
a protein, which is not shared by the biochemical pathways used by
Bax and α-syn to inflict death on yeast cells. On the other
hand, the compounds 4f, 4r, and 4s are unable to overcome Bax-induced yeast cell death, triggered by
mitochondrial dysfunction,12 but still
can rescue α-syn-mediated apoptosis which, similar to the Bax
expression in yeast, also occurs via loss of MMP and generation of
excess ROS. It is, therefore, very likely that compounds 4f, 4r, and 4s are the ones that prevent
aggregation of α-syn and thereby prevent α-syn-mediated
apoptosis (for visualization of concept, see Figure 8). Hence, we asked the question whether compounds 4f, 4r, and 4s would also prevent
the aggregation of the βA4 peptide. We have found that, like
in human cells, overexpression of βA4 causes yeast cell death.
It has earlier been shown that the overexpression of a GFP-tagged
βA4 in the yeast leads to its spontaneous aggregation, thereby
causing toxicity but not cell death.6b,46

2.11 Testing of Methoxy-Stilbenes for Rescue of
Human βA4-Expressing Yeast Cells
The seven methoxy-stilbenes
depicted in Figure 8E were next tested in the yeast strain that secretes two copies of
the 42-amino acid human βA4 peptide gene (i.e., in cells where
the βA4 peptide is targeted to yeast’s secretory pathway
with the help of a signal sequence), to see if any of these compounds
overcome βA4-mediated block in cell growth. It has been reported
that, like in human cells, βA4 is only toxic to yeast cells
when it enters the pathway that allows secretion of a protein/peptide
from eukaryotic cells.6 The synthetic human
βA4 gene, with the 5′-end invertase signal sequence (Invss),47 was synthesized on the basis
of the published βA4 protein sequence (NCBI Accession # P05067). The Invss-βA4 gene and the βA4 gene (without the Invss) were cloned in two yeast integrative plasmids that allow
integration at the HIS3 and URA3 chromosomal loci (see Section S7, Supporting Information). Chromosomally integrated
copies (i.e., 1-copy and 2-copies) of the Invss-βA4
gene and the βA4 gene (without the Invss) were expressed,
in the yeast strain BC300, under the control of galactose-inducible
GAL1 promoter. Because the yeast cells that express secreted βA4
do not grow in galactose (Figure 9I,II), which is in contrast to cytosolic the expression
of βA4 (i.e., without the Invss), where cells do
grow, it would indicate that the expression of only the secreted βA4
peptide (Figure 9III)
is toxic to the yeast. Secretion of the βA4 peptide, but not
its cytosolic expression, causes yeast cell death (Figure 9IV).

the human βA4 gene on minimal medium solid agar plates that

of cells that express cytosolic βA4 (lane 1), one copy of secreted
Invss-βA4 (lane 2) and two copies of Invss-βA4 (lane 3), probed with a βA4 antibody (Abcam, ab12267);
the same proteins were probed with a β-actin antibody (Proteintech,
60008-1-Ig), which acted as a loading control. (IV) Percentage of
cells undergoing death in yeast strains expressing one copy (panels
C,D) and two copies of secreted Invss-βA4 (panels

of cytosolic βA4, without the Invss signal sequence,
are represented in panels A and B. Dead cells were stained red with
Phloxine B. The data represent mean ± SD of five independent
fields of observation. Around 200 cells were counted in each field.
The left-hand panels show cells in phase contrast microscopy.

The selected methoxy-stilbenes
were tested to see if they would
overcome secreted human βA4-mediated cell death in the yeast.
Yeast cells, expressing two copies of Invss-βA4,
were incubated in 96-well plates, at 30 °C, in the presence or
absence of compounds; the plates were shaken at 200 rpm. The results,
depicted in Figure 10A, obtained using these cells, were compared with those obtained
from human Bax-expressing yeast cells and the three different strains
that express human α-syn. None of the methoxy-stilbenes that
had restored cell growth suppressed by α-syn had any ability
to rescue cells that were blocked in growth by two copies of secreted
βA4. This was also confirmed by attempting to form yeast colonies
on solid agar plates, in the presence of compounds 4f, 4q, 4r, 4s, and 4u (10, 5, and 2.5 μM concentrations), from cells that express
two copies of secreted βA4 in SG minimal medium containing galactose
(Section 8, Supporting Information). EGCG
was used as a positive control in this set of experiments.20,48

Figure 10 (A) Summary of the methoxy-stilbenes effect on the growth of human
α-syn, βA4, and Bax-bearing yeast cells at 10 μM.
The two-copy Invss-βA4 strain was used, in the presence
of 10, 5, and 2.5 μM compounds, on SG agar plates. The data
represent mean ± SD of four independent experiments where optical
density at 600 nm (OD600) was measured for each cell culture.
(B) Cartoon depicts some of the possible pathways that can lead to
apoptosis, when the human proteins α-syn, βA4, and Bax
are expressed in the yeast. It shows the points in the pathways that
certain methoxy-stilbenes can act and prevent apoptosis.

The results, presented in Figure 10A, strongly suggest that the compounds 4f, 4r, and 4s specifically target
the aggregation
of α-syn, but surprisingly not that of βA4. These three
compounds are also unable to prevent Bax-mediated block in cell growth
and induction of cell death. It could be inferred that, only by preventing
α-syn aggregation, the compounds 4f, 4r, and 4s inhibit the toxic manifestations of the overexpression
of human α-syn in the yeast that result in loss of MMP, ROS
generation, and resultant apoptosis (Figure 10B).

2.12 Prevention
of α-Syn Aggregation by
Compound 4s
The compound 4s was
further tested in yeast cells expressing two copies of α-syn-eGFP
fusion protein. As shown in the fluorescence picture of cells expressing
two copies of α-syn-eGFP fusion protein in the absence of compounds
(Figure 11C), the
cells marked with white arrows shows α-syn aggregation, whereas
the ones with yellow arrows show dead cells. However, when the cells
were treated with compound 4s at 5 μM, cells do
not show aggregation of α-syn (Figure 11D). The results show that compound 4s is likely to have the ability to prevent α-syn aggregation
(Figure 11A–D).

3 Conclusions
The screening of a library of methoxy-stilbenes, in parallel, using
yeast cells that express human α-syn, Bax, and βA4, has
resulted in the identification of compound 4s as a likely
inhibitor of α-syn aggregation. The compound 4s does not possess antioxidant properties. It prevents yeast cell
death brought about by expression of two copies and three copies of
the wild-type α-syn gene as well as three copies of its A53T
mutant. However, it does not rescue yeast cells from Bax- and βA4-induced
death. The in silico docking studies indicated that it binds to the
two sites on the β-sheet of the α-syn fibrils. The results
presented in this paper suggest that compound 4s could
be used for further exploration in preclinical studies related to
PD. Results also illustrate that simultaneous use of three sets of
recombinant yeast cells, which express human α-syn, Bax, and
βA4, could rapidly reveal compounds from a chemical library
that may specifically prevent the aggregation of α-syn.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 General
1H, 13C, and DEPT and 2D-NMR spectra were recorded on Brucker-AVANCE
DPX
FT-NMR 500 and 400 MHz instruments. NMR experiments were carried out
in the indicated solvent. Chemical data for protons are reported in
parts per million downfield from tetramethylsilane and are referenced
to the residual proton in the NMR solvent (CD3OD 3.31 ppm).
Carbon nuclear magnetic resonance spectra (13C NMR) were
recorded at 125 or 100 MHz: chemical data for carbons are reported
in parts per million (δ scale) downfield from tetramethylsilane
and are referenced to the carbon resonance of the solvent (CD3OD, 49.0 ppm). ESI-MS and HRMS spectra were recorded on Agilent
1100 LC-Q-TOF and HRMS-6540-UHD machines. All chromatographic purifications
were performed on Sephadex and Dianion HP-20 resin. Thin layer chromatography
was performed on precoated silica gel 60 GF254 aluminium
sheets (Merck). All solvents used were of analytical grade and purchased
from Merck. The HPLC purity analysis of all samples was carried out
on a UPLC Shimadzu system (LC20ADXR), connected with a Lichrosphere
RP18e (5 μ, 4.6 mm × 250 mm) column, and was eluted with
water (0.1% formic acid): ACN gradient at the flow rate of 0.8 mL/min.
The gradient elution was set with the increasing concentration of
ACN in following format: 5% ACN (0–3 min), 5–80% ACN
(3–8 min), 80% ACN (8–12 min), 80–20% ACN (12–14
min), and 5% ACN (14–16 min). The detection wavelength used
was 254 nm. All compounds comply the purity requirement of >95%
(HPLC
purity).

4.2 General Procedure for Preparation of (E/Z)-1-Styryl Methoxybenzene 4a
To the stirred solution of benzyl triphenylphosphine
halide salt 7 (2.8 mmol) in anhydrous THF (10 mL) under
N2 atmosphere
was added potassium tert-butoxide (3.0 mmol) in small
portions at 0–5 °C, and the resulting mixture was stirred
at 80 °C for 30 min. Formation of orange color was observed in
the reaction. Reaction was cooled to the room temperature, and the
respective 2-methoxy benzaldehyde 6 (0.5 g, 2.5 mmol)
was added. The resulting reaction mixture was again refluxed at 80
°C for 30 min. The reaction mixture was quenched with ethyl acetate
(10 mL), and the solvent was evaporated under vaccum, followed by
partitioning between water and ethyl acetate (50 mL × 2). The
organic layer was collected, dried on anhydrous sodium sulphate, and
evaporated on a rotary evaporator to get the crude product. The crude
product was purified by silica gel (#100-200) column chromatography
using 20% EtOAc/hexane to get (E/Z)-1-styryl methoxybenzene 4a in 95% yield. The ratio
of cis/trans isomer in isolated products was determined by HPLC. All
other stilbenes 4b–4ac were synthesized using
a similar procedure.

4.3 Cloning of α-Syn, Bax, and βA4
Genes in Yeast Integrating Vectors
The gene coding for human
α-syn, its A53T mutant, Bax, and βA4 was cloned using
standard molecular biology techniques as either BglII-XbaI or BamHI-XbaI
fragments in appropriate yeast integration vectors. The maps of the
resultant plasmids have been shown either in the manuscript or in
the Supporting Information.

4.4 Construction of Yeast Strains That Bear Integrated
Copies of the α-Syn, Bax, and βA4 Genes
The integrative
plasmids, obtained after cloning of the human genes, were linearized
with appropriate restriction enzymes, before transformation into the
yeast strain W303-1a (Mata, ade2, his3, leu2, trp1, ura3; ATCC 208352). It has been referred to here
as the strain, BC300. Integration of plasmids into the yeast genome
at specific chromosomal sites of BC300 occurred via homologous recombination.14

4.5 Growth of Recombinant Yeast
Cells in Liquid
and Solid-Agar Media
The recombinant cells were grown either
in synthetic dextrose minimal medium (SD; contained 0.67% bacto-yeast
nitrogen base, with no supplements, and 2% glucose which is also known
as dextrose) or in synthetic galactose minimal medium (SG; contained
0.67% bacto-yeast nitrogen base, with no supplements, and 2% galactose).
SD and SG media are selected for the presence of the chromosomally
integrated plasmid. The solid agar SD, SG, and YPD plates contained
the same ingredients plus 2% agar. For growing pre-cultures of cells,
complete YPD medium, containing 2% bacto-peptone and 1% yeast extract,
was used.51

4.6 Microtiter
Plate Assays for Identifying Compounds
That Rescue Yeast Cells from the Toxicity of α-Syn, Bax, and
βA4
α-syn, Bax, or βA4-expressing yeast
cells were initially grown in SD medium at 30 °C, for 24 h. Cells
were harvested, washed with sterile water, and then resuspended in
SG medium. Cells (103) were inoculated in 195 μL
SG medium (that contained 2% galactose and 0.2% glucose, with appropriate
nutrients); for the initial screen, 5 μL of individual compounds
in the methoxy-stilbene chemical library was added to cell suspension
such that the final concentration of compounds was 10 μM and
a DMSO concentration <0.5%. Control cells (containing no α-syn,
Bax or βA4), in the absence of compounds but with a DMSO concentration
<0.5%, were grown in SG in the same manner. The two flavonoids,
fisetin and quercetin, which have been identified as compounds with
the therapeutic potential in a yeast-based model of α-synucleopathy,
were used as positive controls.52 Unfortunately,
resveratrol (1) and piceatannol (2) (Figure 1A) did not restore
cell growth blocked by two copies of α-syn; rescue of α-syn’s
toxicity in yeast by resveratrol (1) and piceatannol
(2) has not been reported in the literature. Cell growth
was determined via measurement of optical density at the wavelength
of 600 nm (OD600). The OD600 was measured, before
the plates were shaken, using a Synergy HT BioTek plate reader, and
the parameters were set using the KC4 software. The OD600 was measured once again after 48 and 72 h of shaking at 30 °C
on a rotating platform set at 200 rpm. The growth of each set of cells
incubated with different compounds is calculated by subtraction of
the OD600 at 72 h from the initial OD600 at
0 h and is then expressed as a percentage growth compared to the control
cells (that contained just DMSO and no compound) using Excel. Compounds
showing a repetitive high percentage cell growth of 20% and over in
the following yeast strains were identified: two-copy α-syn,
three-copy α-syn, three-copy mutant A53T α-syn strains,
and Bax. The identified compounds were then further tested in the
two-copy βA4-expressing yeast cells.

4.7 Detection
of Dead Cells with Phloxine B Dye
Cell death was measured
by staining with Phloxine B which is a
fluorescent dye. Live (i.e., viable) cells expel Phloxine B dye; the
dye accumulates only in dead cells. This can be observed using a fluorescent
microscope. Phloxine B (Sigma, P-4030-25G) was added to both test
yeast cells (bearing the human gene) and control yeast cells (that
contain empty plasmid) to a final concentration of 5 μg/m. After
incubation at 30 °C for 30 min in the dark, the cells were washed
with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) three times. Cells were
then mounted on a hemocytometer for cell counting and on a glass slide
for microscopic examination with an Olympus BX-51 fluorescent microscope
(at excitation/emission 570/650 nm). Image capturing was done using
a Leica digital imaging color camera.

4.8 Yeast
Colony Formation
The method
was used to distinguish between the numbers of live cells in control
cells and cells expressing α-syn, Bax, or βA4 in the presence
and absence of “hit” compounds. Yeast strains of interest
were grown in10 mL of YPD liquid medium as pre-cultures. Cells were
centrifuged, washed twice with SG, and resuspended in a final volume
of 10 mL. The OD600 was determined, and the cells were
also counted using a hemocytometer. Three hundred cells were spread
on a fresh SG agar plate (with appropriate amino acids), containing
10, 5, and 2.5 μM concentration of a compound of interest. Control
cells contained no compound. The plates were incubated at 30 °C
for 3–4 days. The colonies formed were counted manually, and
the difference in colony numbers from different cultures was recorded.

4.9 Detection of ROS with Dihydroethidium
An
AAT Bioquest Fluorimetric Intracellular Total ROS Activity Assay
Kit (Catalog #22901) was used to measure ROS. After expression of
protein(s), OD600 was again measured and cells were counted,
and 100 000 cells were pipetted into wells of a 96-well microtiter
plate (Corning, # 04815027) in triplicate. The plate was centrifuged
at 800 rpm for 2 min, and supernatants were discarded. Cells in wells
of a microtiter plate were then resuspended in yeast cell culture
medium and centrifuged for 2 min at 800 rpm. DMSO (40 μL, component
C of the kit) was added to ROS red (component A of the kit) and mixed
well. ROS red is cell-permeable and generates red fluorescence when
it reacts with ROS. The ROS red/DMSO mixture (20 μL) was added
to 10 mL of assay buffer (component B of the kit) and mixed well.
This is regarded as the working solution. Working solution (100 μL)
was added per well of cells. The plate containing cells was then incubated
for 90 min at 30 °C. Fluorescence was then bottom read with a
Bio-Tek Synergy HT plate reader at excitation/emission 520/605 nm.

4.10 Measurement of MMP in Yeast Cells
An AAT
Bioquest JC-10 MMP Assay kit (Catalog #22800) was used for
measuring MMP. The kit uses JC-10 dye and can selectively enter into
the mitochondria. JC-10 changes color from green to orange as the
polarization of the mitochondrial membrane increases. The reaction
is reversible because of the formation of monomeric (green; emission
at 520 nm) and aggregated (orange or red; emission at 570 nm) forms
of JC-10, as MMP increases. In healthy cells, JC-10 accumulates in
the mitochondrial matrix and forms orange (or red) fluorescent aggregates,
but in necrotic or apoptotic cells, JC-10 disperses out of the mitochondria
and changes to the monomeric form. Cells are then stained with green
fluorescence. After expression of human proteins in yeast, OD600 was measured and cells were counted, and 100 000 cells
were pipetted in triplicate into wells of a 96-well microtiter plate
(Corning, 04815027). Cells were centrifuged at 800 rpm for 2 min.
Cells were then resuspended in yeast cell culture medium and centrifuged
for 2 min at 800 rpm. All kit components were thawed at room temperature.
Component A (50 μL, 100x JC-10) was added into 5 mL of assay
buffer A (component B) and mixed well (this is the working solution).
The working solution (50 μL) was added to wells of a microtiter
plate, and the plate was incubated for 90 min at 30 °C (in the
dark). Assay buffer B (50 μL, component C) was added to each
well already containing cells and JC-10. The plate was centrifuged
for 2 min at 800 rpm before loading the plate on to the Bio-Tek Synergy
HT plate reader so that excitation/emission 490/525 nm and 540/590
nm could be read from the bottom. The ratio of aggregated/monomeric
JC-10 was plotted.

4.11 TUNEL Assay to Detect
Nuclear DNA Fragmentation
of Yeast Cells
An AAT Bioquest TUNEL Apoptosis Assay kit
(Catalog #22844) was used for the detection of DNA fragmentation.
The kit works by incorporating the fluorescence dye TF3-dUTP at the
3′-OH ends of apoptotic DNA fragments. After the expression
of the protein of interest, OD600 was measured, and cells
were counted, and 30 000 cells were pipetted on to wells of a 96-well
microtiter plate (Corning, 04815027) in triplicate. The plate was
then centrifuged for 2 min at 800 rpm. Supernatants were removed,
and 100 μL of 4% formaldehyde fixative buffer was added to each
well and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The fixative buffer
was removed and cells were washed twice with PBS. Component A (6 μL,
100× TF3-dUTP) was added to 600 μL of component B (reaction
buffer). The abovementioned mixture (50 μL) was added to wells
of a 96-well microtiter plate and incubated for 120 min. Cells were
then washed and fluorescence was monitored from the bottom with the
help of a Bio-Tek Synergy HT plate reader at excitation/emission 550/590
nm. An Olympus BX-51 fluorescence microscope with a Leica digital
imaging camera was used to take the microscopic images.

4.12 Staining with Hoechst Dye for Monitoring
Live Cells
Hoechst 33258 (pentahydrate (bisbenzimide) FluoroPure
grade; Cat #H21491; Thermo Fisher Scientific) is a nucleic acid stain
that is widely used to detect live cells. When bound to double-stranded
DNA, the Hoechst dye emits blue fluorescence. Yeast cells expressing
a protein of interest were counted, and 1 × 106 cells
were pipetted into an Eppendorf tube. Cells were incubated with 5-bromodeoxyuridine
for 30 min, and 500 μL of 10 μg/mL of Hoechst 33258 was
added to the tube and incubated for 10 min. Cells were washed with
PBS and viewed under a fluorescence setting using an Olympus BX-51
fluorescence microscope with a GXCAM-FLUOMAX fluorescence digital
camera, with magnification 60× and Image J software version 1.48.

4.13 DDPH Antioxidation Assay
It is a
simple and quick method for evaluating the antioxidant potential of
a compound, an extract from biological sources. The assay is based
on measuring the decrease in the absorption at 517 nm of DPPH, whence
the compound or extract is mixed with DPPH solution. DPPH is a stable
free radical which changes color from red to yellow when scavenging.
The DPPH concentration in a sample is reduced when it reacts with
antioxidants, hence the absorbance decreases. The scavenging potential
of the antioxidant is proportional to the degree of discoloration
of DDPH. Initially, 0.1 mM DPPH (Sigma, D9132) solution was prepared
in methanol. For dilution of DPPH, a PBS/methanol solution (20% PBS,
80% methanol) was used. The testing was done in 96-well microtiter
plates, in triplicates. Each microtiter plate is setup so that final
volume in each well is 300 μL. Each well has 3 components (volumes
in μL): PBS-methanol (75)/DPPH stock (150)/Compound stocks(75),
and they are added in that order, in triplicate.

4.14 ABTS Antioxidation Assay
ABTS free-radical
scavenging assay was used to determine the total antioxidant activity
of compounds of interest. It is based on the measurement of ABTS radical
cation formation in the presence of an unknown compound. Trolox [6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic
acid], a water-soluble vitamin E analog, served as a positive control
for inhibiting the formation of the radical cation. The ABTS-solution,
7 mM ABTS, 2.45 mM potassium peroxodisulfate in PBS (pH 7.4), was
freshly made and stored in the dark at room temperature for 4 h to
stabilize. The ABTS solution was diluted 1:50 in PBS to provide an
absorbance of ∼0.7 when read at 734 nm. In a 96-well microtiter
plate, 20 μL of compounds (from 200 μM stock solutions)
was pipetted in triplicate. For the positive control, 20 μL
of 200 μM Trolox was used. For the negative control, 20 μL
of 10% DMSO was used, and 180 μL of diluted ABTS solution was
added to all wells. The absorbance was read at 734 nM, in 30 s intervals,
over 60 min. The results were analyzed using Excel.

4.15 Statistical Analyses
Data from experiments
were analyzed by Microsoft Excel 2010 or GraphPad Prism. Student’s t tests were performed to compare EC50 values
