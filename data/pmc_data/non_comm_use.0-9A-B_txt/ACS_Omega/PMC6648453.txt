The ground state (GS) of Chichibabin’s
polycyclic hydrocarbons
(CPHs) can be singlet [open- or closed-shell (OSS or CS)] or triplet
(T), depending on the elongation of the π-system and the exocyclic
substituents. CPHs with either a small singlet–triplet energy
gap (ΔEST) or even a triplet GS
have potential applications in optoelectronics. To analyze the effect
of the size and exocyclic substituents on the nature of the GS of
CPHs, we have selected a number of them with different substituents
in the exocyclic carbon atoms and different ring chain lengths. The
OPBE/cc-pVTZ level of theory was used for the optimization of the
systems. The aromaticity of the resulting electronic structures was
evaluated with HOMA, NICS, FLU, PDI, Iring, and MCI aromaticity
indices. Our results show that the shortest π-systems (one or
two rings) have a singlet GS. However, systems with three to five
rings favor OSS GSs. Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) and aromatic
substituents in the exocyclic carbons tend to stabilize the OSS and
T states, whereas electron-donating groups slightly destabilize them.
For CS, OSS, and T states, aromaticity measures indicate a gain of
aromaticity of the 6-membered rings of the CPHs with the increase
in their size and when CPHs incorporate EWGs or aromatic substituents.
In general, the CPHs analyzed present small singlet–triplet
energy gaps, and in particular, the ones containing EWGs or aromatic
substituents present the smallest singlet–triplet energy gaps.

Introduction
Chichibabin’s
polycyclic hydrocarbon (CPH), p,p′-biphenylene-bis-(diphenylmethyl) (n = 2
and R = Ph in Scheme 1a), was synthesized in 19071 by Russian
chemist Aleksei Yevgen’evich Chichibabin.2 Three years before, Thiele and Balhorn3 reported an analogue hydrocarbon with n = 1 and R = Ph, whereas Müller and Pfanz4 produced the species with n =
3 and R = Ph in 1941. The electronic structure of Chichibabin’s
compounds and that of their derivatives (closed-shell quinoid vs open-shell
diradical forms, Scheme 1a) have been a recurring topic of debate for both theoretical and
experimental chemists.5 In 1986, despite
the extremely oxygen-sensitive nature of Chichibabin’s hydrocarbon,
Montgomery et al.6 determined its molecular
structure by X-ray diffraction. In addition, they determined that
this molecule has a singlet ground state (GS) with a small singlet–triplet
energy gap (ΔEST) and a large amount
of diradical character, i.e., it is a Kekulé diradicaloid.
Chichibabin’s, Müller’s, and related hydrocarbons
have usually a diradical or diradicaloid GS and a small ΔEST.6−8 These species are getting special
attention owing to the tunable character of their GS that can be singlet
[open- (OSS) or closed-shell (CS)] or triplet (T), depending on the
length of the π-system and the exocyclic substituents.9−11 In general, the longer the hydrocarbon, the greater the diradical
character.12 Indeed, many investigations
support this relationship and also add the fact that the aromaticity
is increased in larger CPH systems.13,14

and Diradical (Benzoid) Resonance Forms of CPHs; (b)
Different Substituents Studied in This Work
π-Conjugated open-shell diradical(oid)s, such as
Chichibabin’s
and Müller’s hydrocarbons and analogues, are being intensively
investigated as potentially multiple functional organic materials
that can be employed as semiconductors in organic field effect transistors,15,16 as organic light-emitting diodes,17 as
light-harvesting dyes in organic solar cells,18 as near-infrared fluorescent probes,19 and as chromophores in nonlinear optics (NLO).11,20−22 Indeed, NLO properties were shown to be particularly
enhanced for systems having intermediate diradical character such
as Chichibabin’s hydrocarbons.23−26 Unfortunately, the intrinsic
instability of these hydrocarbons prevents their practical applications.
For this reason, several related hydrocarbons with increased stability
have been synthesized in the last decade.12,27−36 The quest of thermally stable diradicals arouses considerable interest
because these molecules have a great potential for numerous advance
applications.37

It has been recently
shown that substituents on the two biphenylmethylene
moieties of tetrabenzo-Chichibabin’s hydrocarbons have a significant
influence on their chemical bonding and physical properties.38 From a computational point of view, studies
regarding the effect of the substituents on the molecular structure
of CPHs or other oligothiophenes analogues are limited to few examples.
Most of the studies are mainly focused on the effect of the CPH chain
elongation.26,39 For the case of quinoidal thiophene
oligomers, Nakano and co-workers26,40 examined the
effect of the substituent at the terminal positions, by replacing
R = H by CN, showing that the effect of this replacement is small.
The main aim of this work is to study what is the effect of the exocyclic
substitution in Chichibabin’s hydrocarbons on their stability
and diradical character. We will also analyze the influence of the
length of the π-system. In particular, we will consider Chichibabin’s
hydrocarbons with n in the range of 1–5 and
as substituents the set depicted in Scheme 1b. Some of the substituents have π-donor
character (2, 3), others have π-acceptor
character (4, 5), and some of them have
aromatic rings with more or less π-acceptor or π-donor
character (6 to 11). Our hope is that the
results obtained provide clues that will help designing polycyclic
hydrocarbons with enhanced stability and tuned diradical character.

Results
and Discussion
Geometry optimizations of different CPHs,
with substituents from 1 to 11 (Scheme 1) and chain lengths
(n) from 1 to
5 rings (to refer to a specific compound, we will employ the nomenclature:
substituentn), were performed at the OPBE/cc-pVTZ
level of theory. Three electronic states, namely, closed-shell singlet
(CS), open-shell singlet (OSS), and triplet (T), were considered for
the calculations. Scheme 2 represents the resonance structures proposed for the n ≥ 2 systems, which can present from 0 to n aromatic π-sextets.41,42

Scheme 2 Proposed
Resonance Forms for the CS (Top) and OSS/T (Bottom) States
of the Chichibabin Polycyclic Hydrocarbons
The
different radical positions
represented for the OSS/T case are also possible for the equivalent
CS situation with zwitterionic structure (for instance, structure III is the radical analogue of II; there are
zwitterionic structures analogues of IV to VII). n represents the total number of rings.

Data in Table 1 show
that for 71 and 72, for which experimental X-ray data is available,6 the theoretical bond distances are in good agreement with
the experimental ones if one considers that the GS of these CPHs is
the CS, as experimentally found.6 From
all optimized geometries, only the CS systems 1, 2, and 3 with n ≤ 2 are
planar (dihedral angle values (α) lower than 5°), indicating
a huge contribution of the quinoid resonant form in these cases. For
the n = 2 geometries, the H···H distance
between neighbor hydrogens of the chain rings is about 1.95 Å,
less than the sum of their van der Waals radii. In spite of this,
the molecule is planar because the stabilizing effect of the conjugation
is strong enough to outweigh the H···H repulsion. However,
in other systems with n ≤ 2, the α values
can be up to 22° (6), indicating a diminished quinoid
contribution to the CS structure in this short-ring-chain cases. Most
of these CPHs are nonplanar because of the twisting distortion of
the 6-membered rings. The dihedral angle that measures this distortion
can be either positive or negative. Because of that, we have a number
of possible conformers (see Figure S3).
We analyzed all possible conformers for 1n (n = 2 to 5), and our results showed
that energy differences between conformers are not larger than 0.003
eV (see Table S2). For this reason, for
the rest of the systems, we decided to start the optimization from
the planar geometry and to use the final geometry without analyzing
whether it corresponds to the most stable conformer. As can be seen
from the α values (Table 1), the loss of planarity is smaller in the case of CS than
in OSS and T structures, but even so, the distortion in the CS case
is still significant. This loss of planarity is also increased by
enlarging the chain length. In systems having more neighbor H pairs,
the repulsive contribution become more important; for example, in
the case of system 1 having n = 3 (so,
two nonbonded H pairs), α values are around 14°, whereas
for n = 5 (four H pairs), the α values range
from 25 to 32°. H···H repulsions decrease with
torsion at the cost of reducing conjugation. The degree of distortion
is also affected by the nature of the R group; an electron-donating
group (EDG) (3) presents smaller α values than
EWG and aromatic substituents (5, 6, and 7). This can be related to the fact that EDGs are not efficient
in stabilizing the negatively charged C atom (structure II and zwitterionic analogues of IV to VII), thus disfavoring the benzoid forms.

As said before, the twisting distortion
is larger in OSS and T
states. For these states, the inter-ring C–C bond is a single
bond and, therefore, rotation over this bond is easier than in the
CS states. For the T states, α is always larger than 35°.
This situation reminds that of the biphenyl system that is distorted
by 44.4°43 to avoid steric hindrance
with ortho hydrogen atoms.44 For these
systems, there is an interplay between the gain of stabilization due
to conjugation in the planar geometry and the reduction of H···H
repulsions for α = 90°. The actual dihedral angle represents
the best compromise between these two counteracting forces for each
case. EDG (3) presents smaller α values than EWG
and aromatic substituents (5, 6, and 7), as expected from the fact that EWGs and aromatic substituents
can better stabilize the radical centers, thus favoring the benzoid
forms.

Similar arguments can be applied to explain the bond
distances
and harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity (HOMA)45−47 values. In
the previously discussed cases, where the benzoid form is preferred,
outer-ring bonds (d1, d3, and d5) are larger and
inner-ring bonds (d2, d4, and d6) are closer to the
aromatic C–C distance (1.40 Å). HOMA indices are closer
to 1 in these cases (an aromatic compound has an HOMA value close
to 1, whereas a nonaromatic has value 0 or even lower). Moreover,
we can observe that both bond distances and HOMA values are indicating
that central rings (C and B) are more aromatic than the external ones
(A). This is in good agreement with the existence of the proposed
resonant forms (Scheme 2) since in most of the structures the aromatic sextet is maintained
in the central rings but not in the external ones. Interestingly,
HOMA values in between 0.5 and 0.7 are calculated for CPHs in their
CS states, indicating a partial aromatic character of the 6-membered
rings that reveals the importance of resonance structure II and analogues.

To gain deeper insight into the electronic
structure of the Chichibabin
diradical(oid)s (OSS and T states), we analyzed the Mulliken spin
densities of those carbons contained in the main axis of symmetry
of the molecule (see Tables S20–S30 of the SI for more details). We observe that in systems with small n values the spin densities of carbons in position 1 are
close to 1 (or −1), whereas the other carbon atoms have values
close to 0. By increasing n, the spin population
values decrease in position 1 carbons and increase in position 2 carbons;
for example, in the R = H and n = 4 system, the populations
of positions 1 and 2 are 0.7 and 0.2, respectively. Alternatively,
in all cases, we have found values close to 0 for the position 3 carbons,
indicating that the resonance forms with radicals in these positions
are not particularly relevant for describing the OSS and T state structures.

The energies (ΔECS–X,
where X = OSS or T) estimated by means of quantum chemical calculations,
in most of the cases, suggest that the GS is a CS state for species
with n ≤ 2 and an OSS state for larger n compounds, having a situation like the one depicted in Figure 1 for species 8. For systems with diradical character, we would expect a
T GS according to the Hund rule. However, we found that even though
the T state lies close to the OSS singlet, it is always higher in
energy.48,49 This fact can be explained by the two-state
model of Zilberg and Haas.50 They attribute
the extra stabilization of the OSS to the possible resonance structures
that can exist in the OSS but not in the T form. Since in the T state,
the parallel unpaired electrons cannot form a bond, some of the resonance
structures are excluded.

Figure 1 Energy (eV) diagram of the CS, OSS, and T states
(referred to CS)
depending on n for the R = p-fluorobenzene
system (8).

Among all systems, there are three exceptions. The first
one is
system 3, having a CS GS for n = 1–3
(Table 2). Then, systems 6 and 11, in which for n = 1
the GS is also CS, but in the case of n = 2, the
OSS solution lies 60.59 and 2.59 meV, respectively, below the CS state.
When the OSS solution is lower in energy than the CS, the CS solution
can be considered a singlet excited state. In the case of T states,
the general trends for the relative energies (with respect to the
CS state) are dependent on the substituent nature in a manner similar
to the OSS results for n > 2. As regards to EDG
(2 and 3), T state lies above the CS up
to n = 3. In the case of 6 and 11, only the T state of n = 1 system is higher
in
energy than the CS, and in the remaining cases, H (1),
EWG (4 and 5) and aromatic (7, 8, 9, and 10) substituents,
the T is less stable than the CS state for n up to
2. Interestingly, for compounds 6 and 11 with n ≥ 3, the OSS and T states are much
more stable than the CS. Especially, remarkable is the case of 113 and 114 where the OSS
solution is more than 0.40 eV more stable than the CS one. Our study
provides evidence that the exocyclic substituents have a direct effect
on the nature of the GS of Chichibabin’s systems. EDGs favor
the CS form, whereas EWGs and aromatic groups stabilize the diradical
form, consequently favoring the OSS and T situations. Our calculations
indicate that 13, 43, 53, and 62 systems
have almost degenerated CS and T states (with energy differences not
larger than 0.03 eV), whereas almost all systems with n = 5 together with 113 and 114 have particularly stable diradical GS.

a For n = 3, the
diradical character (y) of the OSS systems is also
included.

For all compounds,
we observe a decrease of ΔEST when n is increased until reaching
the degeneracy of the states (Figure 2). This is because at high n values
the distance between radical centers increases, and hence, the energy
difference between OSS and T states is reduced. There is a clear trend
regarding the effect of increasing the chain length, that is the lowering
of the singlet–triplet gap with the increasing number of n. Therefore, for small n values, we have
CS CPHs; for larger n, CPHs are diradicals; and for
intermediate n values, CPHs are diradicaloids,9 the borders between the different species being
somewhat fuzzy and R dependent. This is corroborated by the increase
of y values (see Computational Details) from 0 (CS species) to 1 (pure diradical) going from n = 1 to 5 (Table S19). Moreover, y is also affected by the exocyclic substituents (Table 2b), and the results
are consistent with the structural and energetic measures. Systems 23 and 33 present CS character,
whereas the others are diradicaloids with y values
from 0.3 to 0.7, with the aromatic groups being the ones presenting
larger y values. Finally, the trends in ΔEST value differ for small and large systems.
For small n values (CS ground state), one can notice
that there is a significant difference between the two EWG systems 4 and 5. In the case of n =
1 and 2, the singlet–triplet energy gap for 5,
which has a large electron-accepting character, is larger than for 4. On the other hand, for the case of EDG, there are no differences
between both EDG 3 and 4. For n > 2 (OSS ground state), ΔEST is
almost the same for the two EWG 4 and 5 (see Figure 2), whereas for the
two EDG 2 and 3, there are some differences,
ΔEST being somewhat larger for 3 having the substituent with higher π-donor character
(R = NH2).

We performed an exhaustive evaluation of the aromaticity
using
many electronic indices, MCI, PDI, Iring, and FLU; magnetic
NICS(0)zz and NICS(1)zz indices; and the previously commented geometric index,
HOMA. In the case of MCI, PDI, and Iring, positive values
close to the result obtained for benzene are indicative of the aromatic
character of the analyzed rings, whereas smaller values close to those
of cyclohexane correspond to nonaromatic species (Table 3). In the case of FLU, the maximum
aromaticity is achieved when FLU = 0. Finally, for the nucleus-independent
chemical shift (NICS), negative values indicate that the compound
is aromatic, and vice versa.

The trends of aromaticity values
given by the different indices
correlated with the CS-T energy gaps for compounds 1, 3, 5, and 6 (one substituent belonging
to one of the four different groups studied) are presented in Figure 3. In general, we
can observe a good agreement between the different indices, showing
the following orders from less to more aromatic: 1 < 3 < 5 < 6 in the CS singlet
and 3 < 1 < 5 < 6 in the T state, with an exception in the case of NICS, which
classifies 3 as the less aromatic compound in both cases,
CS and T. For the 1, 3, and 5 CS structures, the values obtained resemble those of the nonaromatic
cyclohexane and 1,4-cyclohexadiene results. Instead, for most of the
T and some of the 6 CS forms, the results are more similar
to those of benzene. ΔEST is small
when the difference between the aromaticity of the triplet and CS
states is minor and vice versa. Furthermore, it is important to mention
that the T and OSS singlet states of CPHs are not 4N e– Baird aromatic species as in the cyclopentadienyl cation but Hückel-type
systems having 6π e– per ring.

dashed lines correspond to singlet CS and the triplet values, respectively.

Figure 3 depicts
the average aromaticity measures per ring. Depending on the number
of rings and the symmetry and environment of these rings, we have
defined four different ring types: A, B, C, and A′ (Figure 4a). A-type rings
are located at the ends of the chain, and they are connected to two
R groups on one side and another ring on the other side. B-type ones
are surrounded by two other ring units but are not in the middle of
the molecule. Finally, C and A′ type are in the center of the
molecule with symmetric substitution but with the difference that
C-type rings are in between two ring units whereas A′-type
rings are in a terminal position.

C-type rings for CS and OSS states of the R = 1, 3, 5, 6, and 11 systems
with n = 5.

Regarding the electronic aromaticity indices of each specific
ring
type, we observe that qualitatively MCI, PDI, Iring, and
FLU give the same results (see SI). The
former four indices indicate that, as expected from resonance structures
of Scheme 2, Chichibabin
compounds are more aromatic in the T state than in the CS one, in
which they are less aromatic (structures of type II provide
some aromaticity, especially in the central rings) or are even nonaromatic,
as can be seen for the case of A and A′ type of rings (Figure 4b). OSS structures
are in between CS and T ones with n values from 3
to 5, and the difference between the OSS and T forms become less notable
when n increases. The extra stabilization of the
OSS comes from the quinoid resonance forms, which is not occurring
in the case of the T. For this reason, the systems in the T state
are more aromatic, as their unique structure is the benzoid form.

Figure 4b shows
the behavior of the local aromaticity in 1n species, which is the general trend found in CPHs.
First, the internal rings B and C are more aromatic than the terminal
A and A′ ones. Second, there is an increase in the aromaticity
of B and C rings with n in both singlet and triplet
states. A-type rings show the same trend for CS and OSS states, but
in the case of the T state, the increase of aromaticity with increasing n is not observed (Figure 4b).

Results in Figure 4c show that the terminal substituents have
an influence on the aromaticity
of the compounds, especially on the external rings. EWG favors the
T and OSS states stabilizing the diradical character and increasing
the aromaticity of the rings. It seems that the aromaticity decreases
going from strong EWG as cyanide to strong EDG as amine, with the
exception of aromatic substituents, which are poor EWG (the phenyl
group has a weak π-donor and inductive withdrawing character)
but present the largest aromaticity values. The latter family is especially
good in stabilizing the radical forms because it can be delocalized
over the π-system, which also explains why the R = aromatic
are the systems with the most aromatic rings, especially the A-type
ones. We can also observe that the differences between diverse substituted
Chichibabin compounds are less noticeable in the central rings than
in the external ones. The particular case of 11, which
has the most stable OSS and T state structures, does not present the
high aromatic character that we would expect and the values obtained
are similar to the ones of 5.

The evaluation of
the aromaticity by means of the NICS index leads
to results similar to those yield by the electronic indices (see Tables S34–S36), as it was explained in
the general comparison thereby referring to Figure 3. Nevertheless, there are differences when
comparing individually the distinct types of rings. For the A type
in the CS and OSS cases, the aromaticity increases going from small
to large n values and from EDG to EWG. On the contrary,
in the T state, the aromaticity decreases significantly when n increases. However, with the electronic indices, we observe
that there was no variation in the aromaticity of A rings with changing n and with NICS we found meaningful changes. For example,
compound 1n NICS(0)zz values for n = 1–5
are −3.3, −0.3, 1.8, 2.7, and 2.8. In B-type rings,
the aromaticity increases with n for the OSS and
CS, and it is maintained for the T. Finally, for C-type rings, the
aromaticity increases when increasing n in all cases.
It is likely that this particular behavior of the NICS indicator of
aromaticity is caused by the coupling of the magnetic fields generated
by neighboring rings.51−53

Conclusions
The molecular and electronic
structures of Chichibabin’s
polycyclic hydrocarbons have been studied to discuss the effects of
elongating the π-system and changing the exocyclic substituents.
For large n systems, an increase of the twisting
distortion is observed as a consequence of the H···H
biphenyl-like repulsions, leading to a loss of planarity and conjugation.
All CPHs systems present singlet–triplet energy gaps lower
than 1.4 eV. Among them, most of the systems with n > 2 have small ΔEST ranging
from
200 to 0.2 meV, thus being potential candidates for the design of
new materials with NLO properties. The resonance structures proposed,
together with the fact that the energy difference between OSS and
the triplet is reduced when the distance between radical centers increases,
gives a good explanation for the lowering of the ΔEST when going from n = 1 to 5. Species 13, 43, 53, and 62 have almost degenerated CS
and T states (with energy differences lower than 0.03 eV), whereas
almost all systems with n = 5 as well as 113 and 114 have particularly stable
diradical GS. The aromaticity measures show a gain of aromaticity
with the increase of n. Central B and C rings are
more aromatic than external A-type rings. Aromatic substituents and
EWG tend to stabilize the diradical(oid) forms better than EDG. These
findings help in understanding the effect of exocyclic substituents
and π-system length on ΔEST values of Chichibabin diradical(oid)s and may aid in the design
of tuned π-electron materials for molecular electronics.

Computational
Details
All geometry optimization, energy, and nucleus-independent
chemical
shift (NICS) calculations were performed with the Gaussian16 set of
programs.54 To select an appropriate method
for the calculations, several DFT functionals were tested and compared
against CCSD(T)/cc-pVDZ//QCISD(T)/cc-pVXZ (X = D, T) results for the
R = H and n = 1 and 2 systems (see Tables S1–S3 in the SI). As a result of this test and
also based on some calculations of spin-state splittings found in
the literature,55−60 we conclude that the best option for these systems is to use the
OPBE/cc-pVTZ level of theory.61,62 In addition, for meta- and para-benzyne, it was shown that
pure generalized gradient approximation functionals such as OPBE were
superior to hybrid functionals for the description of the open-shell
singlet state.63−65 Moreover, for systems 11–5, we compared the OPBE and the range-separated LC-OPBE and ωB97xD
results to see how long-range corrections affect the description of
the systems with large n values (3–5). The
range-separated functionals give larger spin contamination values,
with ⟨Ŝ2⟩ between
1.2 and 1.8 for the case of OSS and more than 2 for T (see Table S4 of SI). In the case of OSS systems,
we perform broken-symmetry calculations giving as a result the collapse
on CS species in the cases of n ≤ 2 and OSS
structures in the other cases. We have taken a pragmatic approach
and have not applied spin contamination corrections for three reasons:
(i) the concept of spin contamination is not completely meaningful
at the DFT level because of the absence of a strict definition of
the wave function;66 (ii) when the overlap
between open-shell orbitals is small, errors due to spin contamination
are minor;67 and (iii) for benzyne isomers,
spin contamination corrections to DFT results lead to worse predictions
of ΔEST as compared to experimental
results.68 We have checked the stability
of the approximated DFT wave function for all species. The diradical
character (y) of the OS systems has been estimated
making use of the spin-unrestricted natural orbitals (UNOs) with the
following index proposed by Kamada et al.69−71 1  where nHOMO and nLUMO are the occupation numbers of the bonding
and antibonding UNOs.

The aromaticity of the electronic structures
was studied using
geometric (HOMA),45−47 electronic72 (PDI,73 Iring,74 FLU,75 and MCI76), and magnetic (NICS) aromaticity indices.77,78 For the latter, we have evaluated three positions of the space NICS
(0, 1, and −1) (shown in Figure S5 of SI). The aromaticity indices (except for NICS, which has been
calculated with Gaussian16) have been computed using AIMall79 together with ESI-3D packages.75,80,81
