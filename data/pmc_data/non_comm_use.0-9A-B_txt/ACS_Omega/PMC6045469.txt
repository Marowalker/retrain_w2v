A combination of
genotype, cultivation environment, and protein
separation procedure was used to modify the nanoscale morphology,
polymerization, and chemical structure of glutenin proteins from wheat.
A low-polymerized glutenin starting material was the key to protein–protein
interactions mainly via SS cross-links during film formation, resulting
in extended β-sheet structures and propensity toward the formation
of nanoscale morphologies at molecular level. The properties of glutenin
bioplastic films were enhanced by the selection of a genotype with
a high number of cysteine residues in its chemical structure and cultivation
environment with a short grain maturation period, both contributing
positively to gluten strength. Thus, a combination of factors affected
the structure of glutenins in bioplastic films by forming crystalline
β-sheets and propensity toward the ordered nanostructures, thereby
resulting in functional properties with high strength, stiffness,
and extensibility.

Introduction
Fossil fuel-based polymers
are known for their high carbon footprint
affecting the environment negatively. Thus, renewable alternatives
to replace fossil fuel-based polymers have received increased attention
in recent years.1,2 Proteins are biological macromolecules
with intriguing chemical properties of relevance for bioplastics production.3 For example, glutenin proteins from wheat possess
unique polymeric properties and have therefore been considered as
a potential alternative to replace fossil fuel-based polymers in some
applications.4

Glutenin proteins
consist of high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits
(HMW-GS) and low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS).5 These GS are known to polymerize, e.g., in bread-making
processes through disulfide cross-links, and thereby form one of the
largest polymers in nature.6 These giant
macromolecular polymer networks contribute to the strength and elasticity
of the wheat dough during the bread-baking process.7 Polymerization and macromolecular rearrangements into nanostructures
have been suggested as important processes for the successful production
of high-quality protein-based plastic materials and foams.8,9 However, as for the glutenin-derived bioplastics, such structural
rearrangements have so far been a challenge due to the high aggregation
of the polymeric protein network. The glutenins have appeared as an
unbreakable aggregated mass of polymers, and a unique combination
of strength and elasticity associated with the structures as for bread
making has so far not been achieved.10 Materials
from glutenins have been reported as fragile with limited elasticity
compared to other wheat protein materials.10

Bioplastic applications for films, foams, etc., using other
protein
types, such as gliadins, whey, and soy protein, have clearly shown
a correlation between protein molecular reorganization, including
chemical cross-linking, and functional properties.11−13 Previous studies
have pointed out key parameters, such as selection of genetic materials
(G) and cultivation environments (E), for a successful molecular organization
and polymerization of plant proteins.14,15 Furthermore,
protein separation methods have been found to significantly influence
the aggregation level of proteins as well as their ability to depolymerize
before processing.16,17

Previous successful work
on the use of plants as a “green
factory” for developing high-strength gluten films led us to
further focus on the selection of protein source and treatments to
resolve the understanding of protein material properties and their
relationship to protein aggregation. Therefore, the aim of this study
was to combine different factors, such as genetics, environment, and
protein separation procedures, and to evaluate whether and how these
factors could be used to reshape and steer the secondary structure
and nanoscale morphologies in glutenin proteins. We hypothesized that
suitable modifications of the structural morphologies of glutenin
proteins would unravel new functional potentials of the glutenins.
Therefore, two genotypes differing in protein composition (HMW-GS
5 + 10 and 2 + 12) were cultivated under two different growing conditions
(E treatments; Table 1). The selection of the two growing conditions was based on previous
studies, where high nitrogen and low temperature resulted in weak
gluten and low (early) nitrogen and high temperature (during grain
filling) resulted in strong gluten.15 The
weaker gluten in the former was due to high gliadin-to-glutenin ratio.4,15 HMW-GS 5 + 10 has 12 cysteine residues, hence resulting in more
possible disulfide bonds in its chemical structure, leading to higher
strength compared to HMW-GS 2 + 12, which possesses 11 cysteines.18,19 Two gluten separation methods, i.e., harsh (H-gluten), used in industrial
scale for commercially available gluten, and mild (M-gluten),16 were used to obtain glutenins with different
aggregation levels.

By the use of the selected parameters, we expected
to process and
tune glutenin proteins to form suitable secondary and nanoscale morphologies
with attractive mechanical properties for bioplastic applications.

Materials
and Methods
Wheat cultivars, i.e., Diskette (5 + 10) and
Puntari (2 + 12),
used in this study were obtained from Lantmännen, Sweden. Besides
the differences between the two HMW GS, the cultivars differ in other
HMW GS as well (Table S1). These subunits
are expected to play a minor role in the structural and functional
properties of glutenins in bioplastic films as the differences in
gluten strength due to these subunits are small and they are scored
of similar strength in previous studies.18

Wheat plants were grown in trays, with nine plants in each
tray
in biotron facility at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,
Alnarp, Sweden. The soil used was Krukväxtjord, teca (Weibull
Trädgård AB, Landskrona, Sweden), with the amount of N
being 980 gm–3. The day/night temperature used for
plants was 18/14 °C until the initiation of spike and also a
dose of nitrogen (20 mg/plant) were provided to all plants. After
the spike initiation, the plants were divided into two groups (A and
B). Group A plants continued growing at 18/14 °C and were also
supplied with nitrogen to prolong the grain maturation period. Group
B plants were shifted to a chamber set at 25/19 °C and were not
supplied with nitrogen to shorten the grain maturation period. The
plants were kept growing until fully matured spikes were ready for
harvesting. Details of the nitrogen application pattern and amount
as well as cultivation temperatures are given in Table 1 and grouped as two E treatments
(A, B). The aim of these treatments was to develop plants with variation
in grain maturation period20 (also described
in Table 1). The nitrogen
source used was Yara Mila (NPK: 24-4-5) manufactured by Yara AB, Landskrona,
Sweden. Harvesting was done at full maturation of spikes and threshed
using a laboratory thresher. The seeds were milled to white flour
in the analysis laboratory, Lantmännen, Sweden, by a laboratory
mill (Brabender Quadrumat Senior).

Glutenin Modification and Separation in a
Chemical/Shear-Free
Green Process
The structure and strength of glutenin protein
were modified in wheat plants by the use of two genotypes, each under
two sets of environmental interactions (Table 1). The separation of glutenins from the obtained
wheat flour was done in two sequential steps. First, gluten was separated
from the flour in a milder way, by washing the flour in a muslin cloth
under a stream of water until a rubbery mass of gluten was obtained,
which was freeze-dried (Cool Safe, Scanvae, Denmark) and milled to
fine powder (IKA A10, IKA-Werke) afterward. The gluten powder (32
g) was mixed with 70% ethanol (400 mL), stirred for 30 min, and then
kept under shaking at 300 rpm for 2 h at room temperature (22 °C).
The mixture was centrifuged and glutenin was collected as rubbery
pellet, chopped, lyophilized, and milled to fine powder.

Glutenin Separation
from Harshly Treated Industrial Gluten
Industrial gluten
separation (harsh) starts with the wet milling
of grains into flour. Thereafter, an intense mixing, with high energy
inputs (∼8 kJ/(kg min)) and shear forces, of water with the
flour is carried out to create a lump-free dough. For this purpose,
high-pressure homogenizers are used and the dough is processed at
80–100 bar pressure. Furthermore, the centrifugal separation
of components (starch and gluten) and drying of gluten by a ring dryer
at very high inlet (∼140 °C) and outlet (∼65 °C)
temperatures are carried out (personal communication with the industry).
The gluten powder that was prepared industrially by harsh separation
procedure was obtained from Lantmännen Reppe AB, Lidköping
Sweden. A sample of 32 g of this gluten powder was mixed with 70%
ethanol (400 mL) and then agitated at 300 rpm for 2 h at 22 °C.
The mixture was centrifuged and glutenins were collected as a rubbery
pellet. The pellet was chopped into small pieces, lyophilized, and
milled to a fine powder.

Processing of Glutenin into Bioplastic Films
Compression
Molding
Glutenin films were produced by
compression molding glutenin–glycerol mixtures. Each of the
glutenin powder (7 g) was mixed with 3 g of glycerol (99.5%) in a
laboratory grinder (IKA A10, IKA-Werke) using four pulses of 10 s
each for thorough mixing. The glutenin–glycerol blend was placed
in the center of an aluminum frame (100 mm × 100 mm × 0.5
mm) between two preheated aluminum plates and pressed for 10 min at
130 °C in a hydraulic press (Schwabenthan Polystat 400 s). Glycerol
was used as a plasticizer as the films without glycerol are too brittle.

Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) Spectroscopy
Infrared
spectra were recorded for predried (72 h drying in desiccator) glutenin
powder and glutenin films using a PerkinElmer Spectrum 2000 FT-IR
spectrometer (PerkinElmer) equipped with a single reflection ATR accessory,
Golden Gate from Specac (Kent, England). The spectra were recorded
from 4000 to 600 cm–1 and averaged over 32 scans.
The data were normalized to the total amide 1 band intensity from
1700 to 1600 cm–1. The FT-IR absorbance spectra
were first Fourier self-deconvoluted using the spectrum software with
γ = 2 and a smoothing factor of 70%. Peak fitting was carried
out by the peak position assignments to different structures described
by Cho et al.,21 and seven to nine Gaussian
peaks were fitted between 1600 and 1700 cm–1 using
the software Fityk v0.9.8.

Small- and Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (WAXS)
Small-angle
X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements of the glutenin films were performed
at the beamline I911-4 of the MAX IV Laboratory, Lund, Sweden, with
a monochromatic beam of λ = 0.91 Å and a sample-to-detector
distance of 1325 mm. The scattering vector q range
was 0.01–0.7 Å–1 (where q = (4π/λ) sin(θ) and 2θ is the scattering
angle). The sample exposure time was 2 min. A two-dimensional hybrid
pixel array detector (Pilatus 1M, Dectris) was used to register the
data. The collected data were reduced with the software bli911-4 and
normalized by the integral incident intensity and sample transmission.
Background was subtracted using an empty cell signal. Wide-angle X-ray
scattering analysis was carried out at the MAX IV Laboratory, Lund,
Sweden, using the beamline I911-2 with a wavelength of 1.0384 Å
and a sample-to-detector distance of 150 mm with a MarResearch 165
detector. The sample exposure time was 1 min. The data obtained were
analyzed by the software FIT2D. Silicon powder was used as a standard
for calibration.

Size Exclusion High-Performance Liquid Chromatography
(SE-HPLC)
To measure the soluble amount of proteins and their
size distribution,
a three-step extraction procedure with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)–phosphate
buffer (pH 6.9) and sonication was used. Glutenin films were chopped
into small pieces by a scalpel, and three replicates containing 16.5
mg of each sample were prepared. Extraction buffer (1.4 mL) was added
to each sample with shaking at 2000 rpm for 5 min, followed by centrifugation
(30 min, 12 000g, room temperature). The supernatant
was collected into HPLC vials, while the pellet was subjected to two
sequential extractions with sonication: first with 30 s sonication
and centrifugation and second with multiple sonication steps (30 +
60 + 60 s). Then, the supernatants were collected by centrifugation
for each extraction.

To measure the soluble amounts and size
distribution of proteins, each extraction was run on an HPLC system
(Waters, Milford) by an isocratic flow of 50% acetonitrile and 50%
water (both containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)) and the proteins
were eluted at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. UV absorption at 210 nm
was used to detect the proteins. The chromatograms were divided into
low molecular weight (0–13.5 elution time) and high molecular
weight (13.5–25.0 elution time) for both the unprocessed WG
(raw powder) and bio-based films, according to Blomfeldt et al.11

Reversed-Phase High-Performance Liquid Chromatography
(RP-HPLC)
Protein solubility of unprocessed glutenin and
the corresponding
films was measured by RP-HPLC in various nonreducing and reducing
solvents. The films were chopped into small pieces using a scalpel,
and three replicates, each containing 100 mg of every sample, were
prepared to carry out the analysis. Six sequential extraction steps
were adopted from Kuktaite et al.22 and
modified as described by Rasheed et al.8 Each extraction step was followed by centrifugation at 12 000g to collect the supernatant for analysis by the RP-HPLC
system (Waters, Milford) equipped with a precolumn (5 μm, 2
cm × 4.0 mm, Discovery BIO Wide) and a main column (5 μm,
25 cm × 4.6 mm, Discovery BIO Wide, Supelco). A 50 μL sample
injection volume was used for 40 min protein separation, followed
by 15 min cleaning by mobile phase (50% acetonitrile–0.1% TFA
and 50% H2O–0.1% TFA). Gradient flow (28–72%)
was used to elute the proteins at 0.8 mL/min, and chromatograms were
collected at 210 nm and integrated for 6.5–35 min for each
extraction.

Tensile Testing
The films were conditioned
for 48 h
at 23 °C and 50% relative humidity (RH). After conditioning,
nine dumbbell-shaped samples were cut from each film (sample cutter,
ISO 37, type 3). The thickness of the test area was calculated as
an average of five random measurements (Mitutoyo IDC 112B). The samples
were tensile-tested at 23 °C and 50% RH on an Instron 5581 universal
test machine (Instron Corp. Ltd., MN) at a crosshead speed of 100
mm/min using a load cell of 50 N. Stress was calculated from the applied
force divided by the cross-sectional area of the narrow section, and
strain was calculated by crosshead displacement divided by the narrow
section length (16 mm). Young’s modulus was calculated by the
initial slope of the stress–strain curve after toe compensation
(ASTM D638-08).

Statistics
Statistical analysis
software (version 9.2)
was used to calculate the mean and standard deviation values.

Results
and Discussion
Impact of Modification Parameters on Glutenin
Secondary Structures
A remarkable difference was observed
for the intermolecular β-sheet
content of the glutenin films depending on the G × E treatment
and the separation method. A sharp β-sheet peak (1618–1625
cm–1)23 was observed
for all glutenin films based on M-gluten, and clearly, the most intense
peak was recorded from the 5 + 10-B films, whereas the glutenin films
from H-gluten showed a slightly developed shoulder for β-sheets
(Figure 1). The peak
size data (Table 2)
indicated a variation in the relative amount of strong intermolecular
β-sheet contents of different films. The lowest amount of intermolecular
β-sheets was found in glutenin films from H-gluten (26%), and
the highest amount was found in 5 + 10-B films (53%). In general,
our results showed a high relative amount of β-sheets for all
glutenin films from mildly separated gluten (M-gluten), whereas glutenins
from H-gluten showed a relatively high proportion of α-helices
and random coil structures (Table 2). Thus, the protein separation procedure turned out
to be the most important parameter to affect the ability of glutenin
proteins to form dominant β-sheet structures.

films from H-gluten and 2 + 12 and 5
+ 10 glutenins (H-gluten-derived films are later designated as aggregated
glutenins).

Previous reports suggest that the
development of β-sheets
in wheat-based protein films is positively correlated to protein solubility
(as a result of the protein separation method) of the corresponding
unprocessed raw material.15,16 Therefore, to understand
the background of the dominant β-sheet formation in glutenin
films from M-gluten, the protein solubility of glutenin powders was
evaluated. The highest protein solubility was observed for the 2 +
12-A glutenins, followed by the 2 + 12-B and 5 + 10 (A, B) glutenins,
and the lowest solubility was observed for glutenins separated from
H-gluten (Figure 2).9,11,24 Therefore, glutenins from H-gluten
showed a highly aggregated structure and is designated as “aggregated
glutenin” (AG) throughout this article. A low aggregation in
glutenin powder increased the opportunities of protein–protein
interactions and molecular cross-linking rearrangements during protein
unfolding and refolding events while thermo-molded into films. Preaggregated
glutenin powder instead hindered such cross-linking rearrangements
as observed for the AG films.

Wheat glutenins, in their pristine
form, belong to a category of
intrinsically disordered proteins8,25 and lack ordered
secondary structures such as β-sheets. The ability of proteins
to form secondary structural conformations is influenced by the types
and order of amino acids present in the proteins.26 Aromatic amino acids (tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine)
together with valine and threonine preferably adopt β-sheet
conformations.27 Glutenins in general possess
low amount of β-sheets forming amino acids as observed in their
amino acid sequence8 and also the order
in which they occur. The sequence of glutenins does not support helical
or β-sheet conformations, but are instead related to specific
functions of the proteins.28 Mild gluten
separation combined with glutenins having a high amount of cysteines
in their chemical composition tends to develop the most β-sheet-rich
protein network; 5 + 10 films showed a higher β-sheet content
compared to 2 + 12 films (Figure 1, Table 2). Thus, a higher number of cysteines contribute to the formation
of β-sheets via disulfide cross-links together with H-bonding
within the protein backbone. Also previous reports have shown a positive
impact of disulfide cross-linking on the formation of β-sheets.29,30 Growing condition B implying early grain maturation4,14 and high gluten strength resulted in a higher degree of β-sheets
compared to growing condition A, implying late grain maturation and
weak gluten.4 Thus, glutenins can be tuned
to form secondary structures, such as β-sheets, when a combination
of parameters, such as a mild separation procedure, is used to enable
a low degree of polymerization in the starting material combined with
cultivation conditions and a genotype with the ability to form additional
disulfide bonds during film processing.

Atomic- and Molecular-Level
Structural Rearrangements in Glutenin
WAXS diffraction patterns
for glutenin films from M-gluten displayed
reflections of β-sheet structures with a distinctive d2 peak corresponding to the characteristic interstrand
distance of 4.47 Å (0.45 nm)31,32 (Figure 3a,b, Supporting Information Figure S1). The intensity of the d2 peaks (Figure 3b) was compared for different samples, evaluating the difference
between the maximum intensity of the peak and its baseline, DI = Imax – Ib.
The DI values obtained were: 5 + 10-A: 32.7 nm; 5 + 10-B: 58.9 nm;
2 + 12-A: 36.9 nm; and 2 + 12-B: 19.6 nm (the estimated error is 5%).
The results show maximum values for the sample 5 + 10-B and minimum
values for the sample 2 + 12-B. The difference in intensities of d2 peaks indicates a relationship with the changes
in the β-sheet content (strongly hydrogen-bonded peptide groups)
observed by FT-IR data (Table 2). Nanoconfined β-sheet structures as observed by WAXS
in our study are known to enhance the mechanical properties of other
protein systems such as silk.33 Therefore,
the relationship between the amounts of β-sheets observed by
FT-IR spectroscopy and the intensity of the d2 peak by WAXS provides an indication of the improved mechanical
strength of M-gluten-based films over H-gluten-derived films.

Figure 3 (a) WAXS diffractograms
of 2 + 12 and 5 + 10 films. (b) Zoomed-in
region around the d2 peak (interstrand
distance peak).

In addition, three crystalline
peaks, d1, d3, and d4, were also observed. The d-spacing does not change
significantly for the different samples (Table 3), but intensity variations were noted especially
for peak d1. Similar d-spacing values were observed for silk I and silk II β-sheet
crystals from fibrous proteins.34 The existence
of d1–d4 reflections in our glutenin samples may indicate extended β-sheet
crystals embedded in a dominant amorphous matrix. Importantly, the
dominant scattering features on the WAXS data were two broad peaks, dA centered between 0.97 and 0.96 nm and dB (0.45 nm, superimposed by d2) corresponding to the amorphous phase (Figure 3a). For AG films, WAXS diffraction
recorded only amorphous phases with two broad peaks (Supporting Information Figure S2) corresponding to a low β-sheet
content and random coil structures as also observed in FT-IR spectra.
The other peaks (besides d1–d4 and dA and dB peaks) on the WAXS patterns (Figure 3) not considered as part of
the β-sheet structure are due to small amounts of crystalline
material, most probably starch residues, with a preferential orientation.

The X-ray scattering data at low
angles (SAXS) can provide complementary
structural information on the WAXS data in the nanometric scale. SAXS
intensity curves presented in the Iq2 vs q plot show two peaks (blue arrows, dbroad and ds1; Figure 4a), the first one intense and
broad and the second one with lower intensity and reduced width, for
all 2 + 12 and 5 + 10 films under both E treatments (A–B, Table 1). One more peak, ds2, additional to the previously mentioned one,
was observed for 5 + 10 films (red arrow, Figure 4b). In AG films, only one broad peak was
observed (Figure 4a),
which refers to an aggregated and disordered protein morphology on
a nanoscale.8 The d-spacing
of the peak ds1 remained the same for
all films with HMW GS 2 + 12 and HMW GS 5 + 10 (Supporting Information Table S2). However, the ds2 peak was only observed for 5 + 10 films (Figure 4). The existence of additional
scattering peak in 5 + 10 films could indicate the formation of nanomorphology
correlated with the existence of extended β sheet crystals (WAXS
data) not previously described for glutenin-based system. No obvious
relationship can be found between the d-values on
the SAXS regime, so no attempt of unit cell definition is presented
in this article.

Figure 4 One-dimensional SAXS curves for glutenin films. (a) I × q2 vs q plots
showing the dbroad and ds1 peaks (blue arrows). (b) log I vs log q plots indicating the presence of
low-intensity peaks in the system.

The d-spacing for the broad peak, calculated
from
the position of the maxima and through the relationship d = 2π/qmax, showed a slight variation
among different films (Supporting Information Table S2) by SAXS. The lowest d-spacing was
observed for the 2 + 12-A film, where dbroad = 6.89 nm and the highest d-spacing was recorded
for the 5 + 10 films, where dbroad = 7.32
nm. Our results correspond well with a previous study, where dbroad for glutenin was reported to be 7.01 nm
(70.10 Å).8

The protein separation
procedure along with the specific genotype
turned out to be the most important factor to influence the ability
of glutenin proteins to form nanomorphologies with extended β-sheet
structures. A mild protein separation method enabled low polymerization
of glutenins, which during film processing allowed structural rearrangements
via molecular cross-linking by complete unfolding and refolding of
proteins into compact β-sheet structures, as observed by FT-IR
and WAXS data. Genotypes such as 5 + 10 further enhanced the nanostructural
organization of the system by providing additional cysteine residues
to form disulfide cross-links assisting the formation of stable structures.

Rearrangements in Glutenin Chemical Structure
A difference
in the protein cross-linking pattern was observed by measuring the
solubility of glutenin films in various solvents. All protein films
exhibited extremely low solubility compared to the corresponding glutenin
powders (Figures 2 and 5a), indicating glutenin polymerization upon thermomolding.8,35 The AG films showed the lowest solubility among all of the films
in both the reducing and nonreducing solvents (Figure 5a,b). It can be suggested that a preexisting
protein network via SS cross-links in AG powder (indicated by lowest
solubility in AG powder, Figure 2) complemented with irreversible cross-links, such
as S- and peptide bonds12 (as indicated
by low solubility in extraction steps 5 and 6, Figure 5b), during film formation resulted in highly
aggregated protein structure. Irreversible cross-linking has been
related to poor film properties in previous studies.12 The very low glutenin solubility observed in the films
corresponds well with the results observed for the solubility of industrial
glutenins reported in previous studies.8,24

high molecular weight; AG: aggregated glutenin; 1Ex: SDS–phosphate
buffer; 2Ex: SDS–phosphate buffer + 30 s sonication; 3Ex: SDS–phosphate
buffer + 30 + 60 + 60 s sonication. (b) Protein extractability measured
by RP-HPLC in different solvents: (1) 70% ethanol, (2) 50% propanol,
(3) 50% propanol, 60 °C, (4) 50% propanol 0.5% SDS, 60 °C,
(5) 50% propanol 1% dithiothreitol (DTT), 60 °C, and (6) 1% DTT,
1% SDS, 6 M urea solution, 100 °C. Protein solubility was normalized
to average total solubility of all unprocessed glutenin samples. The
error bars represent standard deviations.

The relatively higher solubility with reducing solvents in
5 +
10 films compared to 2 + 12 films (Figure 5b; ext. 5 and 6) is explained by a relatively
higher amount of cysteine residues in the 5 + 10 genotype compared
to the 2 + 12 one, known for the formation of disulfide cross-links.
Among the two cultivation environments, treatment B (low N, high T)
contributed the most to higher polymerization of glutenins at film
formation (Figure 5a,b) as also indicated by intermolecular β-sheet development,
resulting in a strong glutenin network governed by a positive correlation
between the short grain maturation period of wheat plants and polymer
complexity.4,14

A synchronized pattern
among protein structural parameters, such
as chemical cross-linking, β-sheet content at molecular level,
and nanomorphology, is obvious from the above results. AG films with
the lowest amount of SS cross-links (low values at ext. 5 and 6; Figure 5b) and poor β-sheet
content also indicated an unorganized nanoscale morphology.10 The 5 + 10 films with the highest amount of
SS cross-links (Figure 5b; ext. 5 and 6) and dominant β-sheet content showed high propensity
toward the formation of ordered nanomorphologies.

In previous
reports, the giant molecular mass of glutenins was
described as the restricting factor to obtain high-order structures,
such as β-sheets in glutenins, due to limited possibilities
of molecular rearrangements during thermomolding.8,10 However,
in the present study, we were able to determine that the selection
of particular factors, such as separation method, particular genotype,
and cultivation environment, can significantly improve the quality
of the raw material and influence the properties of the final product
down to atomic and molecular levels.

Relationship between Protein
Structures and Protein Functionality
in Materials
Protein separation procedures were clearly able
to influence the tensile properties of glutenin-based films. A relationship
was seen between the nanoscale morphologies, secondary structures,
and tensile properties of the films. All glutenin films from M-gluten
showed a 100% higher Young’s modulus (E-modulus)
compared to the AG films (Figure 6a). The former also showed high tensile strength (maximum
stress) as well as high elongation at break compared to the AG films
(Figure 6b,c). Previous
studies on protein-based films have shown a general pattern of an
increase in tensile strength and stiffness being connected with a
decrease in extensibility.36,37 In our study, however,
the improvement in Young’s modulus and maximum stress did not
lower the elongation at break, which is an important aspect if one
is looking to design a material with improved strength and stiffness
without affecting elongation. It has been demonstrated via the macromolecular
elastomer theory that chemical cross-links and secondary structures,
such as extended β-sheets, contribute to the protein network
behavior.38 It may be speculated for the
present materials that chemical cross-links among glutenin polypeptides
via SS and hydrogen bonds and extended β-sheets created a cohesive/dense
protein network.39 This cohesive protein
network not only added strength and stiffness to the films,40 but also added improved resistance to crack
formation and early failure of the materials when exposed to stress
(leading to higher extensibility). Our study thereby proposes a possible
relationship among the mechanical properties of the films and the
amount of ordered secondary structures.10,41

Figure 6 Mechanical
properties of glutenin films. (a) E-modulus, (b)
maximum stress, and (c) elongation at break. The error
bars represent standard deviations.

Besides the significant differences observed among the M-gluten
and H-gluten films, the mechanical properties did not differ significantly
among genotypes and E treatments in this study. The lack of such differences
may be the result of relatively fewer structural interchanges in the
glutenin molecule being triggered by the genotype and cultivation
environment than by the separation procedure. The separation procedure
influenced the glutenin structure the most at both the secondary structural
and nanostructural levels compared to the cultivation treatments.
The glutenin films from M-gluten in the present study, in general,
revealed improved mechanical properties, particularly in terms of E-modulus and strength compared to those of previously reported
glutenin materials modified with chemical additives.10 This study showed opportunities to tune the protein structure
at molecular levels by using a mild separation of proteins in combination
with the genotype and cultivation environment to obtain novel nanostructural
and secondary structural organizations.

Our results indicate
a key relationship among the properties of
the starting glutenin powder and resulting structural morphologies
and mechanical profile of the films (Scheme 1). A starting material able to depolymerize
and repolymerize during processing resulted in reorganization of molecular
cross-links, leading to nanoscale morphologies and a high β-sheet
content. Among the G and E interactions, a 5 + 10 genotype with cultivation
conditions increasing the short grain maturation period resulted in
strong glutenins. When processed into materials, these glutenins showed
the highest SS cross-links and hence the highest amount of β-sheets,
as well as being relatively strong and elastic material. The present
study indicates that selection of genotype with the ability to form
a large number of SS cross-links and later using a mild protein separation
to obtain a low-polymerized material (Scheme 1) can result in a valuable low-cost raw material
suitable to produce high-quality bioplastics for various applications.
Protein-based materials, in particular those which are strong and
extensible, are very attractive as next-generation bio-based materials.
Also, the production of specific qualities of protein raw materials
without the addition of chemical modifiers will assist in developing
new green pathways for the bioplastics industries.

Scheme 1 Schematic Summary
of the Impact of Starting Raw Material Properties
on the Final Product
The harshly processed gluten
(H-gluten) leads to the formation of aggregated glutenins, resulting
in amorphous protein structure when processed into bio-based films
with low mechanical properties. Specifically produced M-gluten via
mild protein separation leads to low aggregation in glutenins with
high amount of β-sheets in amorphous matrix.
