The measurement of ζ potential
of Ga-face and N-face gallium
nitride has been carried out as a function of pH. Both of the faces
show negative ζ potential in the pH range 5.5–9. The
Ga-face has an isoelectric point at pH 5.5. The N-face shows a more
negative ζ potential due to larger concentration of adsorbed
oxygen. The ζ potential data clearly showed that H-terminated
diamond seed solution at pH 8 will be optimal for the self-assembly
of a monolayer of diamond nanoparticles on the GaN surface. The subsequent
growth of thin diamond films on GaN seeded with H-terminated diamond
seeds produced fully coalesced films, confirming a seeding density
in excess of 1011 cm–2. This technique
removes the requirement for a low thermal conduction seeding layer
like silicon nitride on GaN.

1 Introduction
With the high breakdown
voltage and current handling ability, gallium
nitride (GaN) high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) are the current
benchmark for high-power, high-frequency applications.1,2 However, the heat generated during high power density conditions
limits the use of such devices, with Lee et al.3 demonstrating that small increases in the operating temperature
can lead to drastic reductions in the device lifetime. To realize
long lifetime and high performance of GaN electronics, it is therefore
essential to effectively extract heat from the devices. At present,
for effective thermal management, the structures are fabricated from
GaN grown on top of SiC substrates4,5 and are widely
used for radio frequency applications due to their superior thermal
conductivity (κSiC ≈ 360–490 W/m K6). The use of SiC has allowed good device performance
in terms of thermal management, but by replacing SiC with diamond
substrates of thermal conductivity up to κDiam ≈
2100 W/m K,7 more significant advances
in GaN electronic devices will be possible.

To fabricate GaN
on diamond devices, the diamond can either be
grown on top of the GaN or vice versa. Although previous trials of
GaN grown on single crystal diamond have led to promising results,8,9 the high cost associated with single crystal diamond makes this
technique unattractive. Alternatively, polycrystalline diamond can
be grown on GaN through the use of an adhesion layer.10,11 However, although the polycrystalline diamond has excellent thermal
properties,12 the poor thermal conductivity
of the typically amorphous adhesion layer presents a barrier to the
extraction of heat from the devices.13 Therefore,
it is crucial to grow the diamond layer directly on to the surface
of the GaN to provide more effective thermal management. Initial attempts
have been made with mixed success.14−16 A further complication
for the case of diamond growth on GaN is that wurtzite GaN has two
distinct terminations along the polar direction. For (0001) GaN, the
surface is Ga-terminated, and for the (0001̅) surface, the GaN
is N-terminated. In the majority of cases GaN HEMT layers are grown
on the Ga-face, and therefore the diamond heat spreading layer must
be produced on the back N-face. Because the GaN crystal is polar along
the [0001] axis, it might be expected that the different crystal surfaces
could have very different charge states, and therefore understanding
diamond film nucleation on the appropriate face is vital.

Because
of large differences in surface energies between diamond
(∼6 J/m2)17 and the most
commonly used Si (1.5 J/m2)18 substrates for diamond growth, attempts at heteroepitaxial diamond
growth usually result in sparse, isolated diamond islands, with densities
of 104–105 cm–2 for
growth on silicon. Hence, a seeding technique is needed to realize
coalesced diamond thin films on foreign substrates. With a similar
large difference in the surface energy19 between diamond and GaN with a value of ∼2 J/m2, a seeding technique is also then required for diamond thin-film
growth on this compound. Historically, a variety of seeding techniques
have been used to grow diamond on nondiamond substrates from mechanical
abrasion with diamond grit to bias enhanced nucleation.20 In this work, we have determined the ζ
potential of both Ga-face and N-face GaN. The result has been used
to select the most suitable diamond particle for seeding the GaN wafers,
leading to self-assembly of the monolayer of diamond nanoparticles.
The seeded wafers have also been imaged using atomic force microscopy
(AFM) to detect the effectiveness of the seeding. Finally, the wafers
with both types of seeds were exposed to diamond growth conditions
to grow thin diamond films on GaN.

2 Results
and Discussion
Figure 1 details
the ζ potential of the Ga-face and N-face GaN surface as a function
of pH. The ζ potential for N-face GaN is negative and there
is moderate variation in the potential as the pH changes from 4 to
9. A similar trend is seen for Ga-face GaN, which has an isoelectric
point at pH ∼5.5 with negative ζ potential at higher
pH values. With water being the solvent for the diamond nanoparticle
seeding solutions, the main region of interest for diamond growth
are the values in the pH range 6–7. In this range, N-face GaN
shows a more negative ζ potential when compared to that of Ga-face
GaN. This can be attributed to two different causes: (i) there is
a presence of higher concentration of adsorbed oxygen on the N-face
GaN,21,22 and (ii) the Ga-face GaN surface is generally
smoother than the N-face GaN surface,23 as is evident from the AFM images in panels (A) and (E) in Figure 2 leading to a minor
inaccuracy in the calculation of the total surface area in contact
with the streaming electrolyte. Foster et al.24 have shown that under aqueous conditions, the N-face of GaN oxidizes
more rapidly than that of the Ga-face. The effect of oxidation of
activated carbon on ζ potential was studied by Chingombe et
al.,25 with the authors finding that the
higher the oxygen content on the surface of activated carbon, the
more negative was the ζ potential at a given pH value. A similar
trend can be seen for hydrogen and oxygen-terminated nanodiamonds
as well, the ζ potential versus pH for which have been plotted
in Figure 1. The oxygen-terminated
seeds show negative ζ potential for the whole pH range, whereas
hydrogen-terminated seeds have a positive ζ potential in the
same range. For self-assembly of a monolayer of nanodiamonds on the
GaN surface, it is important to have the GaN and seed ζ potential
of opposite polarities with the highest possible difference. The results
from the ζ potential study of the GaN surface and diamond seeds
show that such conditions are met when the seeds are H-terminated
and the pH of the solution is close to 8. Another interesting feature
to note in the ζ potential is the change in the potential as
the pH is changed. Foster et al.24 have
shown that as the GaN surface is exposed to higher pH, the oxygen
content of the surface increases, which can lead to a more negative
ζ potential. On the other hand, exposure to aq HCl leads to
chlorine chemisorption, which lowers oxide content26 on the surface, resulting in lower negative ζ potential
and eventually an isoelectric point on the Ga-face GaN.

Figure 1 ζ Potential
vs pH curve for Ga-face and N-face GaN, hydrogen
and oxygen-terminated diamond seeds in water are shown. The hydrogen-terminated
seeds show positive ζ potential in the pH range 4–9,
the Ga-face GaN has an isoelectric point at pH ∼ 5.5, and rest
of the materials show varying degrees of negative ζ potential.
The data for the seeds have been taken from Hees et al.27

Figure 2 AFM images of seeded and unseeded Ga-face and N-face GaN. The left-hand
side (panels (A)–(D)) shows images from Ga-face GaN, whereas
the right-hand side (panels (E)–(H)) corresponds to N-face
GaN. Panels (A) and (E) are for the respective unseeded GaN. Panels
(B) and (F) show the surface after seeding with H-terminated seeds.
Panels (C) and (G) show the GaN surfaces after seeding with O-terminated
seeds. Panels (D) and (H) are the line profiles of unseeded and seeded
surfaces for both types of GaN.

To compare the effectiveness of the seeding solutions, AFM
was
performed on seeded and unseeded GaN surfaces, with the results shown
in Figure 2. Panels
(A) and (E) of Figure 2 show the AFM image of unseeded surfaces of Ga-face and N-face GaN.
The second panel on both sides of the figure (panels (B) and (F))
shows the sample surface after being seeded by H-terminated diamond
seeds. Although the seeds are clearly visible on the smooth Ga-face
GaN surface, the same is not so clearly obvious for N-face GaN. The
reason is the surface roughness of this surface. However, focusing
on the larger crystallites on the surface in both figures (marked
on the images) it can be seen that although in panel (E) the crystallites
are completely exposed, similar crystallites in panel (F) show evidence
of being covered by a conformal layer of particles. Comparing these
small particles with the ones discernible in panel (B), it is quite
clear that there is a very high density of nanodiamond particles also
on this surface. In addition, pieces of both the Ga-face and N-face
wafers were seeded with the O-terminated seeds. The AFM images of
such samples are shown in panels (C) and (G) of Figure 2. On the Ga-face surface, a direct comparison
between panels (B) and (C) shows that the O-treated seeds produce
a less densely seeded surface than the H-terminated seeds. The N-face
surface requires a similar approach as that taken for the H-terminated
seeds, considering the AFM images on larger crystallites present on
the surface. The large crystallites on panel (G) show clear faceting,
and the usual granularity introduced by seeds is missing. Finally,
to compare more closely the three surfaces (unseeded and H- and O-terminated
seeded) for both types (Ga-face and N-Face) of material, we have taken
a line profile from the AFM data. The plots are shown in panels (D)
and (H). The Ga-face surface (panel (D)) is very easy to interpret.
The unseeded line profile is presented in black and shows the presence
of no peaks or valleys. The O- and H-terminated seeded surfaces are
presented in red and blue, respectively. Although the blue curve shows
large number of peaks ranging between 4 and 16 nm, the number of peaks
for the red curve is much lower, showing a reduced seeding density.
For comparing the surfaces of N-face GaN, we have purposely taken
the line profiles in such a way that at least one crystallite falls
in the profile for each surface. As before, the unseeded surface is
plotted in black, O-terminated seeded surface in red, and H-terminated
surface in blue. For all three curves, there is a peak between positions
0 and 0.2 μm. Although for unseeded and O-terminated nanodiamond-treated
surfaces we do not see any subfeatures in the peak, clear subfeatures
can be seen on the H-terminated nanodiamond-treated surface. This
clearly shows that although H-terminated seeds produce a high density
of seeds on the surface, the O-terminated seeds fail to do so, in
line with the ζ potential measurements of the substrates. From Figure 2, it is therefore
clear that H-terminated nanodiamond seed solution is the best option
for creating a high-density seeded surface in both types of GaN. In
the literature, the evidence of surface modification of substrates
by chemical precursors can be found, which leads to nucleation without
modification of detonation nanodiamonds,28 but this technique leads to inclusion of an additional step in the
growth process.

Finally, to test the effectiveness of seeding
with H-terminated
seeds, diamond thin films were grown on seeded (H-terminated and O-terminated)
GaN. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the grown films
were taken, and the results are shown in Figure 3. Panels (A) and (C) in the figure show the
growth on GaN treated with H-terminated diamond seed solution for
Ga-face and N-face, respectively. We can see a complete pinhole-free
film, indicating a seeding density greater than 1011 cm–2. Panels (B) and (D) in the same figure show the samples
treated with O-terminated diamond seed solution for Ga-face and N-face,
respectively. In this case, only isolated crystals can be seen for
Ga-face. Similarly, for N-face, we see noncoalesced growth. The growth
that is seen on the N-face can be attributed to the presence of initial
surface roughness, which can generate spontaneous nucleation sites29,30 but with low site density. So, from these figures it is clear that
O-terminated seeds lead to very low seeding density.

thin films grown on GaN. Panel (A) shows the
growth on surface treated with H-terminated diamond seeds while Panel
(B) shows the sample treated with O-terminated seed solution on the
Ga-Face of GaN. Panel (C) is the image for diamond growth on H-terminated
diamond seeds treated N-face of GaN. Panel (D) shows growth for O-terminated
seed treated N-face GaN showing noncoalesced growth.

3 Conclusions
The
ζ potentials of both Ga-face and N-face GaN grown on
sapphire as a function of pH were measured. Both surfaces show negative
ζ potential between pH 5.5 and 9. The N-face GaN has a more
negative ζ potential, and on the basis of earlier studies by
other groups, this is most likely due to higher concentration of adsorbed
oxygen on the surface. The Ga-face shows an isoelectric point at ∼pH
5.5. The results from the ζ potential study confirm the need
for H-terminated seed solution at pH 8 to drive the self-assembly
of a nanodiamond monolayer on the GaN surface. AFM studies on seeded
Ga-face and N-face GaN confirmed the high seeding density when the
surfaces were treated with H-terminated seeds. The subsequent growth
of thin diamond films on the seeded wafers resulted in a pinhole-free
diamond layer on the surface treated with H-terminated seeds for both
orientations of GaN. This technique of growing diamond directly on
GaN removes the need for a seeding layer like silicon nitride with
low thermal conductivity.

4 Experimental Section
The results presented in this article consider Ga-face and N-face
GaN. The two different orientations were fabricated by using samples
grown by the complementary techniques of metal organic chemical vapor
deposition and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), which are known to generate
Ga-face and N-face layers, respectively, for standard growth conditions.
Both samples were grown on to 2 in. sapphire substrates, with the
Ga-face samples produced in a Thomas Swan close-coupled showerhead
6 × 2 in. system, using trimethygallium and ammonia (NH3) as sources. The details of the growth method are given in Bakshi
et al.31 For the N-polar samples, growth
was carried out in a VG V80H MBE system with an SVTA nitrogen plasma
source. The wafers were first degassed at 450 °C eurotherm for
24 h prior to entering the growth system to reduce contamination.
Sample growths were carried out using 1 sccm of nitrogen gas flow
and a plasma power of 350 W. A 20 min surface nitridation was carried
out on the substrate surface at 750 ± 30 °C (measured by
optical pyrometry, using a 50 nm layer of IR-absorbing molybdenum
deposited on the back of the wafers prior to growth). The GaN was
then deposited with a Ga flux of 17 nA and a growth time of 1 h 30
min to give a layer thickness of approximately 600 nm.

The streaming
potential for both types of wafers were measured
using a SurPASS 3 electrokinetic analyzer. The streaming potential
is determined by measuring the change in potential or current between
two Ag/AgCl electrodes at either end of a streaming channel as a function
of the electrolyte pressure. The electrolyte flowing through the narrow
channel shears the counterions from the charged surfaces in contact
with the liquid. The flowing charge will create a streaming current
across two electrodes positioned tangential to the flow. With the
flow of counterions dependent on the electric double layer of the
surfaces, measurement of the voltage then allows determination of
the ζ potential. Streaming potential measurements have thus
been used to determine the ζ potential of fibers.32 For the measurement of streaming potential on
flat surfaces meanwhile, a setup was suggested by Van Wagenen et al.33 and has been successfully used by many authors
for measurement on various flat surface geometries.34−37 The streaming channel was formed
between two plates of Ga-face or N-face wafers placed parallel to
each other at a distance between 90 and 110 μm, and a 10–3 M solution of potassium chloride was used as the
electrolyte and the pressure varied from 600 to 200 mbar. The pH of
the electrolyte was then altered with 0.1 M HCl and 0.1 M NaOH solutions
using the inbuilt titrator in SurPASS 3.

Seeding was carried
out with monodispersed diamond/H2O solutions in an ultrasonic
bath, known to produce nucleation densities
in excess of 1011 cm–2 atop silicon wafers.38 Two types of solutions were used with both the
wafers, one containing particles which were hydrogen-terminated and
the other containing particles with oxygen termination. Although commercially
available nanodiamond particles are oxygen terminated,39 the process for hydrogen40 termination of nanodiamond particles is detailed elsewhere.
The oxygen- and hydrogen-terminated particles have negative and positive
ζ potential in water, respectively. The particle size as indicated
by dynamic light scattering was found to be approximately 7 nm for
both of the seeding solutions used. To investigate the seeding density
of the samples, atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were taken using
Veeco Dimension 3100 equipped with RTESP tips (Bruker-Nano supplied,
8 nm nominal radius) in tapping mode. Post-AFM, analysis was carried
out with WSXM41 and Gwyddion42 scanning probe microscopy analysis software.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken using a Raith
e-line operating at 20 kV and 10 mm working distance.

For the
growth of diamond on GaN on sapphire, the samples were
diced into 15 × 15 mm2 pieces and seeded. The seeded
wafers were then placed in a Seki Technotron AX6500X microwave chemical
vapor deposition system for diamond growth. Growth was carried under
5% CH4/H2 condition at 40 Torr pressure and
3.5 kW microwave power. After growth, the samples were cooled slowly
in hydrogen atmosphere to prevent cracking of the sapphire substrate.
The growth of diamond on GaN was carried out on both the Ga-face and
N-face of GaN.
