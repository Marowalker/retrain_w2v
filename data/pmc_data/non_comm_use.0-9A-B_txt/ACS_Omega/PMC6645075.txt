Introduction
White organic light-emitting
diodes (WOLEDs) are of great interest
in solid-state lighting and other applications.1−13 A variety of approaches have been proposed for the realization of
white emission. On the basis of the device-processing methods, WOLEDs
can be divided into small-molecule1,6−8,11,13−18 and polymer-based devices.2,3,9,19−22 The small-molecule devices are
fabricated by thermal evaporation in which multiple layers can be
deposited in a one-run, whereas the later polymer-based devices can
be processed by spin-casting, screen printing, or inkjet printing
techniques. The greatest advantage of the later approach is that it
can significantly reduce the cost in mass production especially for
large-area displays. The performance of both small-molecule1,6,23 and polymer19,24−26 WOLEDs has been greatly enhanced by the use of phosphorescent
compounds as the emitters because both singlet and triplet excited
states can be utilized. For small-molecule WOLEDs, the phosphors were
doped into the host by coevaporation and the white light was realized
by several active layers with each layer emitting a primary color1,7,23 or from a triple-doped emissive
layer.6,27 This method of coevaporation is complicated
and expensive because very precise control of the ratios of the red-,
green-, and blue-emitting dopants is needed to obtain white emission.
In contrast, in polymer WOLEDs, the dopants can be easily and accurately
controlled by wet or solution processing.

However, the performance
of polymer-based phosphorescent WOLEDs
is far behind that of small molecules although singly doped red and
green polymer phosphorescent devices using poly(N-vinyl carbazole) (PVK) as the host have shown high efficiency comparable
to that of small molecule-based devices.19,28 One reason is that the band gap of the polymers is not high enough
to confine blue phosphorescent emitters. The blue-emitting component
in WOLEDs so far reported was mainly from the polyfluorene-based polymer
host or backbone, fabricated either by doping red and green phosphorescent
small molecules into the polymer matrix2,19,25 or by attaching the phosphorescent species into the
polymer backbone9,29 and/or side chains.9,20 These polymer white light-emitting devices suffer from the following
drawbacks: (i) low efficiency because the PL quantum efficiency of
the polymer in the solid-state film is low because of polymer interchain
interactions,3 (ii) color instability,
emission color that is sensitive to applied voltage,19,29 a problem with the different components doped into the same layer,
and (iii) efficiency roll-off, whereby the efficiency decreased dramatically
at higher current density because of unbalanced charge injection and
transport.20 Obviously, blue emission has
remained a bottleneck for the performance of polymer-based WOLEDs.

In this paper, we report the fabrication of a simple double-layer
WOLED in which blue-emitting oligoquinoline is used as an electron
transport layer (ETL) and a PVK layer doped with red- and green-emitting
phosphorescent dyes. A luminous efficiency of 8.6 cd/A and a brightness
of 25 990 cd/m2 were achieved from such a simple
device architecture. This device also showed a very high color and
efficiency stability over the whole operating voltage range. These
results demonstrate a new strategy for achieving high performance
and color stability while taking advantage of the ease of processing
of polymer WOLEDs.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the
molecular structures of the materials used in this study. The WOLEDs
have the following structure: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PVK/2-(4-biphenylyl)-5-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (PBD)/Ir(ppy)3/Ir(piq)3(acac)/oligoquinoline 6,6′-bis(2-p-biphenyl)-4-phenylquinoline) (B2PPQ)/LiF/Al, where PBD
was used to enhance electron transport in the polymer blend layer,31,32 and the PVK/PBD ratio was fixed at 30:13 (by weight). Optimal composition
of the PVK blend layer and the relative thickness between the PVK
blend and B2PPQ layers were essential to achieve stable white electroluminescence
(EL) spectra. The best ratio of Ir(ppy)3/Ir(piq)2(acac) to achieve balanced red and green emission was found to be
about 1:2. The PVK/PBD/Ir(ppy)3/Ir(piq)2(acac)
ratio was thus fixed at 69.1:30:0.29:0.60 (wt %) in this study. The
optimal thicknesses of the PVK blend and B2PPQ layers giving pure
white emission were found to be around 60 and 20 nm, respectively.

Figure 2 shows the
EL spectra and the current density–luminance and efficiency
curves from device A (ITO/PEDOT:PSS(40 nm)/PVK/PBD/Ir(ppy)3/Ir(piq)2(acac)(60 nm)/B2PPQ(20 nm)/LiF(1 nm)/Al). This
device emits pure white light that spectrally covers the whole visible
range from 400 to 750 nm. The observed three peaks at 457, 508, and
620 nm are from B2PPQ, Ir(ppy)3, and Ir(piq)2(acac), respectively. The Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage
(CIE) coordinates of device A are nearly identical to pure white through
the whole bias voltage range, ranging from (0.30, 0.31) to (0.34,
0.37) (Table 1). A
maximum forward view luminous efficiency of 8.6 cd/A was achieved
at 11.7 V and 15.3 mA/cm2, at which the luminance was 1316
cd/m2. This corresponds to an external quantum efficiency
of 4.5%. Brightness as high as 25 990 cd/m2 was
observed at 15.2 V bias voltage and a current density of 500 mA/cm2. The performance of device A at various voltages is summarized
in Table 1. It is clear
that the efficiency is very stable over a wide operating range as
also can be seen from Figure 2b. The luminous efficiency remains >7 cd/A at a luminance
up to 12 000 cd/m2.

From the electroluminescence spectra
shown in Figure 2a,
it is obvious that the relative
emission intensity of the red and green components is independent
of the applied voltage over the whole voltage range, and the blue
emission intensity of B2PPQ only slightly varied as the applied voltage
changed. As a result of the stable relative emission intensities of
the blue, green, and red EL bands, very stable white LEDs were obtained.
The color stability of the WOLEDs arises from the electron transport
properties of B2PPQ and the well-aligned energy levels of the two
layers. As shown in Figure 1b, the highest occupied molecular orbital energy levels of
PVK and B2PPQ are 5.8 and 5.5 eV, respectively, and the lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital energy levels of PBD and B2PPQ are 2.4 and 2.7 eV,
respectively. There is a 0.3 eV electron injection barrier from B2PPQ
to the blend layer but no hole injection barrier from the PVK blend
layer to the B2PPQ layer. Thus, at low bias voltage, a little more
charges recombine in the B2PPQ layer than in the PVK blend layer.
Increased bias voltage overcomes the electron injection barrier, leading
to a more balanced charge injection and distribution between the two
layers and consequently exhibiting uniform and stable emission of
red, green, and blue from both layers.

To further understand
the efficiency and color stability of white
OLEDs, device A: ITO/PEDOT:PSS(40 nm)/PVK/PBD/Ir(ppy)3/Ir(piq)2(acac)(55 nm)/B2PPQ(20 nm)/LiF(1 nm)/Al, device B: ITO/PEDOT:PSS(40
nm)/PVK/PBD/Ir(ppy)3/Ir(piq)2(acac)(75 nm)/LiF(1
nm)/Al, and device C: ITO/PEDOT:PSS(40 nm)/PVK(55 nm)/B2PPQ(20 nm)/LiF(1
nm)/Al, with the same total thickness were fabricated under constant
conditions. The EL spectra of the three devices and their current
density–luminous efficiency curves are shown in Figure 3. Device B with only the PVK/PBD/Ir(ppy)3/Ir(piq)2(acac) blend layer emitted yellow light
mainly from iridium complexes with relative intensity identical to
that of device A, whereas device C with pure PVK and B2PPQ layers
emitted blue light from B2PPQ. The peak luminous efficiency and highest
brightness obtained from device A, device B, and device C are 7.92,
6.10, and 2.04 cd/A, and 23 888, 15 330, and 3640 cd/m2, respectively. Both efficiency and brightness achieved from
device A are roughly the sum of device B and device C. This indicates
well-balanced charge injection and distribution in the polymer blend
and blue emission layers in device A. In device B without B2PPQ, except
for the main emission from the phosphorescent dopants, a small emission
from PVK peaked at 430 nm was also detectable (Figure 3a), revealing that the holes are also transferred
by the host as well as direct trapping by the dopants. Therefore,
without any hole-blocking layer, some holes might be quenched at the
cathode, resulting in low efficiency. By adding the B2PPQ layer in
device A, holes from the blend layer were prevented from penetrating
to the cathode and combined with electrons to emit blue light. As
discussed above, the well-aligned energy levels between the adjacent
layers facilitate excellent carrier distribution between them, resulting
in high efficiency and color stability in the whole operating bias
voltage range. We note that because of the very poor hole-transport
property of B2PPQ, no additional hole-blocking layer is needed in
this WOLED. By adding a 20 nm hole-blocking layer of 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline
(BCP) between B2PPQ and the cathode, device D with a structure of
ITO/PEDOT:PSS(40 nm)/PVK/PBD/Ir(ppy)3/Ir(piq)3(acac)(55 nm)/B2PPQ(20 nm)/BCP(20 nm)/LiF(1 nm)/Al showed an efficiency
of 6.95 cd/A, lower than that of device A (Supporting Information), confirming the optimum nature of the present
dual-layer WOLEDs.

nm)/LiF(1 nm)/Al, device B: ITO/PEDOT:PSS(40 nm)/PVK/PBD/Ir(ppy)3/Ir(piq)2(acac)(69.1:30:0.29:0.60)(75 nm)/LiF(1
nm)/Al, and device C: ITO/PEDOT:PSS(40 nm)/PVK(55 nm)/B2PPQ(20 nm)/LiF(1
nm)/Al.

Conclusions
In summary, we have
demonstrated that highly efficient WOLEDs can
be realized from a simple double-layer structure consisting of a blue-emitting
electron-transport layer and a polymer layer doped with red and green
phosphorescent dyes. The peak efficiency obtained from the WOLED is
8.6 cd/A at a brightness of 1316 cd/m2, and the efficiency
was maintained higher than 7 cd/A up to a brightness of 12 000
cd/m2. The CIE coordinates remained in the pure white region,
ranging from (0.30, 0.31) to (0.34, 0.37) throughout the whole operating
bias voltage range. The high efficiency and color stability of the
WOLEDs are because of the utilization of the oligoquinoline ETL, which
facilitates well-balanced charge injection and distribution between
the polymer layer and ETL with well-aligned energy levels. The present
strategy thus combines simple device architecture and easy processing
with achievement of but also allows high color stability and less rolling off in efficiency.
We note that the performance of this dual-layer WOLED still has large
room for further improvement, for example, by performing fabrication
in an inert atmosphere and by employing more efficient phosphorescent
dyes.

Experimental Section
B2PPQ30 was synthesized in our lab as
previously reported. The green and red phosphorescent dyes fac-tris(2-phenylpyridine) iridium (Ir(ppy)3)
and iridium bis(2-phenyl quinolyl-N, C2′) acetylacetonate (Ir(piq)2(acac)) (Luminescence Technology Corp., Taiwan), PVK (Scientific
Polymer Products, Inc., NY), and PBD (Aldrich) were used as received.
The WOLED devices were fabricated by first spin-coating a polymer
layer of PVK/PBD/Ir(ppy)3/Ir(piq)2(acac) onto
PEDOT:PSS/ITO substrates, followed by thermal deposition of the oligoquinoline
(B2PPQ) ETL and the LiF/Al cathode in a high vacuum chamber. The active
area of the device was 0.2 cm2. The current–voltage
characteristics were measured by using a HP4155A semiconductor parameter
analyzer (Yokogawa Hewlett-Packard, Tokyo), and the luminance was
simultaneously measured by using a model 370 optometer (UDT Instruments,
Baltimore, MD) equipped with a calibrated luminance sensor head (model
211) and a 5X objective lens. EL spectra were obtained by using a
PTI QM-2001-4 spectrophotometer. All measurements were carried out
under ambient air at room temperature.
