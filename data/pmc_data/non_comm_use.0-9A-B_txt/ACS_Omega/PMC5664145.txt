Vitamin
B12, or cobalamin (Cbl), is an essential nutrient.
Acquisition, transport, and cellular internalization of Cbl are dependent
on specific binding proteins and associated receptors. The circulating
transport protein transcobalamin (TC) promotes cellular uptake via
binding to specific receptors such as CD320, a receptor upregulated
in several cancer cell lines. In this study, we report the successful
synthesis of 89Zirconium-labeled Cbl that was derivatized
with desferrioxamine (89Zr-Cbl). We document the purity
of the tracer and its binding to TC compared with that of unmodified
cyano-Cbl (CN-Cbl). In vitro studies employing the CD320 receptor-positive
breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-453 showed a 6- to 10-fold greater
uptake of 89Zr-Cbl when compared with the uptake in the
presence of 200-fold excess of CN-Cbl at 37 °C. We used nude
mice with MDA-MB-453 tumors to study the feasibility of employing
the tracer to visualize CD320 positive tumors. In vivo positron emission
tomography images displayed a clear visualization of the tumor with
1.42 ± 0.48 %ID/g uptake (n = 3) at 4 h after
injection (p.i.) with the tracer retained at 48 h p.i. Ex vivo biodistribution
studies using 89Zr-Cbl exhibited the highest uptake in
kidney and liver at 48 h p.i. Results document the feasibility of
synthesizing a Cbl-based tracer suitable for both in vivo and ex vivo
studies of Cbl trafficking and with the potential to visualize tumors
expressing TC receptors, such as CD320.

==== Body
Introduction
Vitamin B12 (cobalamin, Cbl) is a critical nutrient
that is physiologically required to maintain cell growth and differentiation.1−4 Cbl is involved in the biosynthesis of nucleic acids, lipids, and
proteins, and its deficiency leads to a reduction in functional methionine
synthase and metabolism of methylmalonic acid in humans, leading to
megaloblastic anemia and/or various neurological disorders.1−4

Cbl gains entry into cells upon binding to transport proteins
and
subsequent receptor mediated transport. Cbl in blood is bound to the
transport protein transcobalamin (TC) (holo-TC), which, in turn, is
recognized by specific receptors such as CD320.1−4 Upregulation of CD320 receptors
has been reported in several malignancies including breast, prostate,
thyroid, cervical, colorectal, and stomach cancers.5 The important role of Cbl in cellular proliferation and
the upregulation of CD320 in tumor cells has made Cbl uptake an attractive
candidate for tumor imaging, mainly using single-photon emission computed
tomography with 99mTechnetium- or IIIIndium-labeled
Cbl.6−13 One Cbl-positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent, labeled
with 64Cu (t1/2 ∼ 12.7
h), has also been reported.14

Herein,
the utility of Cbl as a vector was explored for delivering
the PET radionuclide 89Zr (t1/2 ∼ 3.27 days). We hypothesized that 89Zr would
(1) retain the sensitivity of PET imaging and (2) provide a longer
visualization window by providing a greater signal-to-noise ratio
compared with prior tracers reported, allowing for an improved tumor
targeting and imaging. Following radiosynthesis, we evaluated the
in vitro uptake and in vivo pharmacokinetics of the CD320-positive
MDA-MB-453 breast cancer in athymic nude mice.

Results
Synthesis of
Cbl-Desferrioxamine (Cbl-DFO)
Cbl-desferrioxamine
(Cbl-DFO) was synthesized by forming a carbamate linkage between the
5′-hydroxyl of deoxyribose moiety in Cbl and the amine group
of DFO (Scheme 1, Figure S1).15 Cbl
was activated using 1,1′-carbonyl-di-(1,2,4-triazole) (CDT),
followed by the addition of DFO, which links through the primary amine.
Purification and characterization confirmed that the conjugate was
of ≥97% purity (Figures S2–S4). The yield of Cbl-DFO was 40 ± 5% based on the Cbl content
in the starting material. Calculated mass (m/z): 1942 [M]; observed: 972 [M + 2H]2+ and 648
[M + 3H]3+.

Scheme 1 Synthesis and Radiolabeling of Cbl-DFO
Radiolabeling of Cbl with 89Zr
Cbl-DFO was
labeled with 89Zr (89Zr-Cbl) using a previously
established protocol (Scheme 1).16 A radiolabeling efficiency
of ∼97% was determined by instant thin-layer chromatography
(iTLC, Figure S5a). The specific activity
of the tracer was determined by titrating 89Zr4+ and Cbl at different mole ratios with an achieved optimum specific
activity of 250 ± 20 mCi/μmol (mean ± standard deviation, n = 3).

In Vitro Stability of 89Zr-Cbl
Stability
of the tracer was analyzed by incubating 89Zr-Cbl in saline
and in human serum at 37 °C. Bound versus unbound radio metal
was analyzed at 0, 4, 24, and 48 h after incubation using iTLC (Figure 1a,b). The intact
tracer was located closer to the origin (40–80 mm), whereas
unbound tracer was found at 100–140 mm. After 48 h of incubation,
free 89Zr was <1% in both saline and serum.

μCi, 3.7 KBq, 0.4 pmol/well) with MDA-MB-453 cells at 1, 4,
24 h time points incubated at 4 and 37 °C. A competition assay
was also performed at each time point using unlabeled Cbl (Cbl 40
pmol/well co-incubated with 0.1 μCi, 0.4 pmol/well of 89Zr-Cbl). The fraction of 89Zr-Cbl internalized in MDA-MB-453
cells is expressed as cpm/105. **** and ** indicate p ≤ 0.0001 and p ≤ 0.01,
respectively. Data are shown as mean and standard deviation, n ≥ 3.

TC Binding Studies
Mouse TC binding of 91Zr-Cbl
was studied by radiometric chase assay using 57Co-labeled
Cbl employing a previously described design.1791Zr-Cbl was synthesized similar
to 89Zr-Cbl, but with 91ZrCl4. Mouse
TC binding of 91Zr-Cbl displaced 57Co-labelled
Cbl in a manner comparable to that of CN-Cbl (Figure 1c), indicating that the modification of Zr-Cbl
did not compromise binding to TC. The same results were obtained for
binding to human intrinsic factor (data not shown).

In Vitro Uptake
An internalization assay was performed
to test the uptake of 89Zr-Cbl on CD320 receptor cell line
MDA-MB-453 at 4 and 37 °C (Figure 1d). The internalized fractions of 89Zr-Cbl
were expressed as counts per minute (cpm) normalized to 105 cells (cpm/105 cells). Internalization of 89Zr-Cbl was higher at 37 °C versus 4 °C at all time points
with 144 ± 20 versus 36 ± 12 cpm/105 cells at
1 h (p < 0.0001), 210 ± 64 versus 30 ±
9 cpm/105 cells at 4 h (p = 0.01), and
304 ± 25 versus 83 ± 15 cpm/105 cells at 24 h
(p < 0.0001). Competitive assays using excess
Cbl at 37 °C displayed lower binding at all time points (p < 0.01). All of the data are reported as mean ±
standard deviation of four independent measurements.

PET Imaging
PET imaging was performed after the administration
of ∼1 nmol/mouse (200–250 μCi, 7.4−9.3
MBq) of 89Zr-Cbl to nude mice bearing a CD320 positive
MDA-MB-453 tumor (n = 3). The image showed visualization
of the tumor with tracer uptake of 1.42 ± 0.48 %ID/g at 4 h p.i.
with retention observed up to 48 h p.i. (Figure 2a). Cohorts (n = 3) that
were co-injected with 200-fold excess unlabeled Cbl (Figure 2b) showed significantly less
uptake in the tumors (0.20 ± 0.05 %ID/g) at 24 h p.i. (p ≤ 0.001). Other tissues that displayed high tracer
uptake were the kidney and liver with 8.92 ± 1.45, 8.80 ±
1.06, and 8.10 ± 0.58 %ID/g for kidney and 4.27 ± 0.51,
4.48 ± 0.65, and 4.47 ± 0.69 %ID/g for liver at 4, 24, and
48 h p.i., respectively (Figure 2c). Tumor-to-muscle ratio (∼3:1) did not change
significantly over 48 h p.i., indicating that the maximum tumor-to-background
ratio was achieved at 4 h p.i. (Figure 2d). All percent injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g)
values are reported as mean ± standard deviation.

by a white circle.

Ex Vivo Tissue Analysis
Biodistribution data obtained
from tumor-bearing mice injected 0.1 nmol (25 microcuries, 0.9 MBq)
of 89Zr-Cbl showed 5.11 ± 1.33, 4.16 ± 1.09,
and 3.78 ± 0.77 %ID/g (mean ± standard deviation, n = 4) tumor uptake in MDA-MB-453 tumors at 4, 24, and 48
h p.i., respectively (Figure 3a, Table S1). The kidneys showed
the highest uptake of the tracer with 94.42 ± 4.27, 103.33 ±
11.50, and 72.74 ± 8.41 %ID/g and the liver showed the second
highest uptake with 20.15 ± 3.42, 16.75 ± 1.44, and 17.99
± 2.54 %ID/g at 4, 24, and 48 h p.i., respectively. Administration
of a 200-fold excess of unmodified Cbl (as CN-Cbl) together with the
tracer (n = 4 mice) resulted in an approximately
100-fold decrease (0.04 ± 0.01 %ID/g) in tracer uptake in tumors
at 48 h and also a decreased uptake in the kidney (1.39 ± 0.18
%ID/g) and the liver (0.08 ± 0.01 %ID/g). These results are consistent
with a Cbl-specific uptake of 89Zr-Cbl (Figure 3b, Table S1) and all of the %ID/g values were reported as mean ±
standard deviation.

Discussion
In this proof-of-concept study, we report
the successful production
of a Cbl-derived 89Zr tracer suitable for use in PET studies.
Studies on nude mice bearing a human breast cancer cell tumor allow
us to demonstrate the use of the tracer for PET visualization of the
tumor.

In agreement with previous data,17,18 we found that 91Zr-Cbl bound to mouse TC in a manner
comparable to that of
CN-Cbl (Figure 1c).
Next, an in vitro assay was performed in the breast cancer cell line
MDA-MB-453 to demonstrate a specific uptake of 89Zr-Cbl.19 We demonstrated a greater than 4-fold uptake
of 89Zr-Cbl at 37 °C versus 4 °C; blocking with
200-fold excess unlabeled Cbl had a similar reduced uptake (Figure 1d). These results
support the idea that the targeting properties of 89Zr-Cbl
in MDA-MB-453 cells rely on a Cbl-dependent internalization mechanism,
likely through the CD320 receptor.

In vivo imaging with 89Zr-Cbl showed an uptake in MDA-MB-453
tumors with 1.42 ± 0.48 of %ID/g, whereas ex vivo tissue distribution
studies showed a tumor uptake of 5.11 ± 1.33 %ID/g at 4 h p.i.
(Figures 2 and 3). Notable uptake was also observed in the liver
and kidneys with 4.27 ± 0.51 and 8.92 ± 1.45 %ID/g at 4
h p.i., respectively (Figure 2c). An in vivo block using 200-fold excess of unradiolabeled
Cbl showed a significantly reduced uptake (p <
0.001) of the tracer, indicating that the in vivo tumor initialization
is Cbl dependent, supported in the in vitro internalization assay.
Muscle-to-tumor ratio showed that the maximum tumor-to-background
ratio was achieved at 4 h p.i.

To compare the uptake values
with those described in the literature,
the biodistribution data will be used for a more accurate comparative
analysis for the rest of the discussion. Tumor uptake persisted throughout
the 4–48 h imaging period without a significant change (5.11
± 1.33 at 4 h vs 3.78 ± 0.77 at 48 h, p > 0.1), whereas blood clearance was evident between 4 and 24
h with
approximately ∼80% decrease (5.28 ± 0.62 at 4 h vs 0.92
± 0.25 %ID/g at 24 h) in the circulating 89Zr-Cbl;
the final blood activity was observed to be 0.39 ± 0.06 %ID/g
at 48 h p.i.

The tumor uptake achieved in our model is comparable
to that of
the other Cbl-based tracers reported thus far.6−14 Ikotun et al. investigated the tumor uptake of 64Cu-labeled
Cbl in pancreatic, ovarian, murine melanoma, and colorectal tumor
models, with the highest %ID/g being 4.84 ± 0.32 at 6 h p.i.
in the colorectal tumor models.14 In the
melanoma model, the tumor uptake was highest (3.43 ± 0.87 %ID/g)
at 1 h, which decreased to 2.64 ± 0.10 %ID/g after 24 h, whereas 89Zr-Cbl had a higher accumulation and did not show a significant
decrease in tumor accumulation over 4–48 h, p > 0.1.

One of the limitations of our 89Zr-Cbl
tracer is the
observed kidney uptake (94.42 ± 4.27 %ID/g at 4 h), a problem
across all of the Cbl tracers to date. Renal processing is the most
prominent route for Cbl accumulation/storage and/or reabsorption and
is driven by megalin, a known TC-Cbl receptor expressed in kidney
proximal tubuli.20,21 In addition, this is the first
positively charged PET tracer reported, the effect of which is unknown.
An overall positive charge on the Cbl (as 89Zr-Cbl conjugate),
or indeed simply the result of modification of the β-axial position,
may affect the Cbl cellular processing across tissues, as has been
shown previously for two forms with varying α-ligands (OH-Cbl
and CN-Cbl) Cbl species, and warrants further investigation.12,22−24

89Zr-Cbl shows feasibility as a
PET tracer to identify
MDA-MB-453 tumors in vivo. The longer window for PET imaging allowed
for reduced uptake in the kidneys, a problem to date in Cbl radiotracers,
while still maintaining a moderate tumor uptake over 48 h p.i. This
tracer is promising since, to our knowledge, tumor uptake is the highest
reported to date for a B12 based PET probe.

Conclusions
We
have successfully developed and evaluated the first 89Zr-labeled
Cbl tracer as a viable tool for visualizing TC-mediated
Cbl uptake into a CD320 positive tumor. 89Zr-Cbl displayed
retained tumor uptake up to 48 h p.i., allowing for a longer imaging
window. Our data paves the road for future studies to understand the
kinetics of Cbl transport and to study the use as a tool for visualizing
tumors capable of accumulating Cbl.

Experimental Methods
General
Reagents listed below were purchased and used
without further manipulations: dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99%, Sigma),
vitamin B12 (Cbl, ≥98%, Sigma), 1,1′-carbonyl-di-(1,2,4-triazole)
(CDT, ≥90%, Fluka), and acetonitrile (MeCN, 99.8%, Pharmaco-Aaper).
Compounds were confirmed to be >96% pure by high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC), proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), and/or inductively coupled plasma.

Proton nuclear magnetic
resonance (1H NMR) was performed using 400 MHz Bruker spectrometer
with the residual solvent peak as an internal standard. Electrospray
ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry analyses were carried out on a
Shimadzu LCMS-8100. Breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-453) were obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection. Charcoal stripped fetal
bovine serum (FBS) and Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) were purchased from Sigma and KD medicals, respectively. Penicillin–streptomycin
solution with 10 000 units of penicillin and 10 mg/mL streptomycin
in 0.9% NaCl was obtained from Corning.

Analysis of the radiotracer
was performed using instant thin-layer
chromatography (iTLC, Eckert & Ziegler Mini Scan) with an ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) (50 mM) mobile phase.

Synthesis of Cbl-DFO
Cbl-DFO was synthesized through
the activation of the 5′-ribose-hydroxyl group with CDT. CDT
(34 mg, 0.261 mmol, 7.2 equiv) was added with cyano-Cbl (50 mg, 0.0368
mmol, 1 equiv) in anhydrous DMSO (3 mL) at 40 °C for 2 h. DFO
(208 mg, 0.313 mmol, 7.4 equiv) was added to the reaction mixture
and mixed overnight. Purification of Cbl-DFO was done using reversed-phase
(RP)-HPLC (Agilent 1200) with a C18 column (Agilent Eclipse XDB-C18
5 μm, 4.6 mm × 150 mm) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Detection
was done using a UV–vis detector at 360 nm. RP-HPLC method:
(A) 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid water and (B) MeCN as solvents with
the following gradient: 1% B to 70% B over 15 min, (Rt = 9.4 min). Purity was ≥97% via RP-HPLC. Yield:
30–40%. 1H NMR analysis of the aromatic region:
7.178 (s, 1H), 7.016 (s, 1H), 6.426 (s, 1H), 6.218 (s, 1H), 5.989
(s, 1H). Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS)
analysis: expected m/z: 1942; observed:
972 [M + 2H]2+ and 648 [M + 3H]3+.

89Zr-Radiochemistry
Optimum conditions for
radiolabeling of Cbl-DFO were tested by titrating with 89Zr and analyzing the incubated solution using iTLC. Optimum labeling
activity was found to be 250 ± 20 mCi/μmol (9250 ±
740 MBq/micromole). Approximately 1 mCi (37 MBq) of 89Zr(C2O4)2 (3D Imaging, LLC) was diluted with
0.9% saline and the pH was adjusted to 7–7.5 by adding 1 M
Na2CO3. A solution of Cbl-DFO (0.004 μmol,
10.8 μg) was added to the pH-adjusted 89Zr solution
and incubated for 20 min at ambient temperature (Scheme 1). Radiolabeling efficiency
of >97% was determined by iTLC using silica iTLC strips and EDTA
mobile
phase (Figure S5a). The identity of the
tracer was characterized via matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization
mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) analysis using Cbl-DFO labeled with cold
Zr4+ as standard. Expected: 2030.2 [M+]; observed:
2005.2 [M+-CN– + H+]+ (Figure S5b).

In Vitro Stability of 89Zr-Cbl
Stability
of 89Zr-Cbl was tested by incubating the tracer (200 μCi,
7.4 MBq, 100 μL) in saline (0.9% NaCl) and 50% (1:1 serum/saline)
human serum (Sigma) at 37 °C, and the solutions were analyzed
at 0, 4, 24, and 48 h intervals using iTLC (Eckert & Ziegler Mini
Scan).

Mouse TC Binding to 91Zr-Cbl
Nonradioactive 91Zr-Cbl was synthesized for TC binding studies by reacting
Cbl-DFO with 91ZrCl4 as described above. The
conjugate was characterized by ESI-MS (data not shown). Mouse TC binding
of 91Zr-Cbl was confirmed by radiometric chase assay using 57Co-labeled Cbl and compared with free Cbl (cyanocobalamin)
employing a previously described protocol.17 Mouse TC was derived as previously described.25

In Vitro Uptake
Modified internalization
assay was
performed. MDA-MB-453 cells were cultured in Cbl-free media (DMEM
with 10% charcoal stripped FBS) and plated in six-well plates. Each
well contained 200 000 cells plated and incubated overnight.
To each well, 89Zr-Cbl (0.1 μCi, 3.7 KBq, 0.4 pmol
of Cbl per well) was added. For the blocking experiment, unmodified
Cbl was added (40 pmol per well). Plates were incubated for 1, 4,
and 24 h intervals at either 37 or 4 °C. At the end of each time
point, wells were serially washed with phosphate-buffered saline (1×),
acid (1 mM acetic acid and 1 mM glycine), and base (1 M NaOH, 1 mL,
5 min). Each wash was collected and measured for bound activity using
a γ counter (Perking Elmer 2480 WIZARD). Control wells were
trypsinized and counted using a cell counter (Contessa II). Internalized
activity was normalized to 105 cells.

Cell Lines
and Small Animal Xenografts
All of the animal
handling and manipulations were conducted in accordance with the guidelines
set by WSU Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). For imaging and
in vivo uptake experiments, female nude mice (Envigo) were kept under
Cbl-deficient diet (Teklad Cbl-free custom diet, Envigo) for 3 weeks.
Cells were subcutaneously implanted on the shoulder with MDA-MB-453
cancer cells (5 × 106 cells/mouse) after 2 weeks of
Cbl-free diet. Cells were injected in 1:1 media/matrigel (Corning
LLC) at a volume of 200 μL. The tumor volume until was calculated
using the formula length × width2 × 0.52. Mice
with tumors of 100–200 mm3 dimensions were used
for imaging experiments.

PET Imaging Experiment
89Zr-Cbl was intravenously
administered (200−250 μCi/mouse, 7.4−9.3 MBq,
0.8−1 nmol) in sterile saline in mice bearing MDA-MB-453 xenografts.
PET imaging was done using a μPET scanner (Concord) at 4, 24,
and 48 h p.i. time points, while the mice were anesthetized with 1–2%
isoflurane. Images were reconstructed using filtered back projection
algorithm. ASIPro VMTM software version 6.3.3.0 (Concord) was used
to analyze the images to acquire volumes-of-interest expressed as
percent injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g). Competitive inhibition
was done by co-injecting ∼200-fold excess of unmodified Cbl
(200 nmol) with the radiotracer.

Ex Vivo Distribution and
Competitive Saturation
The
tissue distribution of 89Zr-Cbl was studied by administering
10–25 μCi (0.37−0.93 MBq, 0.04−0.1 nmol)
of the tracer on the lateral tail vain of the rodent. For the competitive
saturation assay, ∼20 nmol/mouse of cold CN-Cbl was co-injected
with 89Zr-Cbl. Euthanasia was performed via CO2 asphyxiation at 4, 24, and 48 h p.i.
