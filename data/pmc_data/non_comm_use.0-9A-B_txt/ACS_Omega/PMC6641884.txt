In this work, a photoelectrochemical
(PEC) sensing system was developed
for chemical detection without any tags. The system is based on methylammonium
lead iodide chloride perovskite as the photoelectrochemical signal-generating
molecule, tin oxide nanoparticles (SnO2) as the electron
transport layer, and ionic liquid of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate
(EMIMBF4) as the stabilizer and electrolyte. The photosensitizer
film is formed through spin-coating followed by low-temperature sintering.
Upon irradiation with 473 nm light, an anodic photocurrent is generated
in a blank electrolyte and changed significantly after addition of
hemin into the electrolyte. The change of photocurrent after addition
of hemin suggested that the chemicals participated in a photoelectrochemical
process. Our work paves the way to developing analytical methods with
perovskite.

==== Body
Introduction
Recently, organic–inorganic
lead halide perovskites (ABX3, A = CH3NH3, B = Pb, and X = Cl, Br,
and I) have attracted much scientific interest due to their controllable
band gap, broad absorption spectrum, and long diffusion lengths of
electron and hole.1−3 Currently, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with power
conversion efficiencies (PCE) greater than 20% have been achieved
using a thin layer of mesoporous TiO2.4−6 The device features
a sandwich structure composed of a hole transport layer (HTL, typically
doped 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis (N,N′-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene
(Spiro-OMeTAD)), a mesoporous TiO2 layer loaded with perovskite
materials, and an electron transport layer (ETL) (typically TiO2).

Once the ability of the perovskite absorber material
to transport
both holes and electrons was reported,7−9 investigation of a thin-film
perovskite configuration, with only a compact TiO2 as the
ETL, was conducted.10 However, the results
were not satisfactory. The architecture showed a pronounced hysteresis
of the current–voltage (J–V) curve, especially for fast voltage sweeps, and the PCE is lower
than that of the sandwich structure.11−13 According to Hagfeldt’s
work,14 the strong hysteresis behavior
and scan rate being dependent on current densities resulted from a
band misalignment with the compact and pinhole-free TiO2 layer. Therefore, a low-temperature atomic deposition-fabricated
SnO2 layer was selected as the ETL for the planar PSC’s
fabrication. SnO2, with a deeper conduction band (CB),
demonstrated a favorable alignment of the conduction bands with the
perovskite materials, which helped to fabricate planar devices with
high efficiencies, long-term air stability, and improved hysteretic
behavior. In addition, SnO2 has much higher electron mobility
and stability under UV illumination than TiO2.15 Kuang and co-workers showed that the SnO2 ETL efficiently facilitated the separation and transportation
of photogenerated electrons/holes from the perovskite absorber, which
resulted in a significant enhancement of the photocurrent and PCE.16 So far, fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO),
as a robust transparent conducting electrode, has been widely used
in the thin-film solar cell industry.

The performance of PSCs
is also closely related to the perovskite
morphology. Recently, various advanced processing approaches have
been developed to better control the morphology and crystal film growth
of perovskite, including vacuum thermal evaporation,17 one-step solution deposition,18 sequential step deposition19 and solvent-induced
precipitation.20 Despite the evident success
of microstructure control to improve the performance of PSCs, a lack
of proven stability is still the biggest obstacle on the path of PSC’s
outdoor application. The instability mainly stems from the perovskite
degradation under humid conditions. An effective way to alleviate
the problem is to construct a dense water-resisting layer that can
block all accessible pathways on the perovskite surface. Grätzel
and his co-workers have shown that modifying the surface of methylammonium
lead triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3) with
alkylphosphonic acid ω-ammonium chlorides can work toward high
photovoltaic performance as well as give tenacious resistance to moisture.21 Through a facile surface functionalization
technique, dodecyltrimethoxysilane22 and
3-hydroxypyridine23 are separately assembled
on the perovskite surface as efficient protective layers.

Recently,
several studies have focused on the potential application
of ionic liquids (ILs) in high performance PSC’s fabrication.24−26 Ionic liquids with ionic conductivity, low vapor pressure, and large
dissolving capacity are promising candidates in the area of electrochemistry.
Up to now, a series of ionic liquids have been used as processing
additives or interfacial modifiers to modulate the morphology of perovskite
films. For example, by using ionic liquid methylammonium formate (MAFa)
as solvent, Moore25 reported that the obtained
CH3NH3PbI3 films demonstrated excellent
coverage, uniformity, and large crystal domains. Shahiduzzaman et
al.26 employed the low vapor pressure ionic
liquid 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride to fabricate a uniform
distribution of perovskite nanoparticles. Moreover, taking hydrophobic
tertiary and quaternary alkylammonium cations as interfacial modifiers,
Yang’s group27 fabricated perovskite
films with excellent water-resisting ability even under high relative
humidity (more than 90%). Although addition of ILs may be beneficial
to preparing better PSCs, no current literature has reported on testing
the photochemical performance of perovskite in ionic liquid as a purpose
of improving the stability of the sensor.

1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
tetrafluoroborate is one of the room-temperature
ionic liquids with unique excellent physical and chemical properties.
In this work, we prepared the perovskite films on a compact SnO2 layer and observed the performance of the perovskite/SnO2/indium-tin oxide (ITO) electrode in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
tetrafluoroborate (EMIMBF4) solution. The results showed
that the morphology of the perovskite film changed after EMIMBF4 immersion but the photocurrent of photoelectrochemical (PEC)
measurements remained reasonably stable in 20 cycles. With the addition
of hemin, the PEC response of MAPbI3 decreased, suggesting
that the oxidant agent might consume the electrons produced in the
perovskite absorbers. Our study herein provides an efficient way of
developing a highly efficient MAPbI3-based PEC system,
which may be suitable for chemical detection.

Results and Discussion
The scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the perovskite
films is shown in Figure 1. The top-view image demonstrates full coverage of the film
on the SnO2/ITO substrate. Figure 1B is the cross-sectional image of the full
device. The resulting planar electrode has a sandwich-like configuration,
with the annealed films forming a capping layer on the SnO2 ETL. It is different from previous TiO2 or Al2O3-perovskite devices in which the perovskite was predominantly
formed within the mesoporous TiO2 or Al2O3 films.28 Because the SnO2 nanoparticles are densely packed, leaving no room for the precursor
solution to infiltrate, crystallization can only happen on top of
the SnO2 ETL.

image of the photoelectrochemical layer.

According to Tidhar’s report, the mesoporous TiO2 scaffolds could contribute to a more uniform layer.29 However, to make the process much easier, we
abandoned
the mesoporous TiO2 scaffolds, taking only the compact
SnO2 layer as the ETL in this work. Thus, the nonuniform
morphology in Figure 1A may be related to the compact SnO2 ETL. The purpose
of PbCl2 addition in the precursor solution is to improve
the quality of the perovskite polycrystalline degree of films.29Figure 2 is the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and energy
dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mappings of the annealed perovskite
films. The EDS mapping clearly suggests that lead and iodine were
distributed uniformly in the fully annealed perovskite films, whereas
the content of chloride was limited. XPS results further confirmed
that no significant chloride concentration was found in the end product.
With excess organic precursor, chloride might be released in the form
of CH3NH3Cl during the annealing process.30 Overall, PbCl2 drives the crystals
to coalesce and form a well-covered crystalline domain, which is essential
for achieving high-quality devices despite its nonuniformity.29

spectroscopy (EDS) of the perovskite films with elemental mapping

In the following experiments, the resulting perovskite/SnO2/ITO was used for photoelectrochemical measurement. Figure 3 shows the photocurrent
curve recorded as the 470 nm excitation light was turned on and off.
The photocurrent of SnO2/ITO could be negligible, and the
photocurrent response was produced by the perovskite films. In the
case of perovskite/SnO2/ITO electrodes immersed in the
aqueous solution, the photocurrent response could be regenerated many
times but the signal dropped quickly after every on–off cycle.
As the aqueous solution turned yellow, we speculated that the perovskite
films dissolved in water. The black line in Figure 3 is the photocurrent response of the electrode
in EMIMBF4. Compared with that in water, the performance
of the electrode in EMIMBF4 was dramatically improved.
The signal remained at the same level in the first 5 cycles and fell
by only 15% after 20 cycles. Additionally, we examined the stability
of the perovskite films after storage in ambient condition. Figure S1 displays the absorption spectra of
the perovskite under different storage times. The compact SnO2 ETL exhibited high transmittance and had no adsorption at
470 nm. Both perovskite films, freshly prepared or stored in ambient
condition for 10 days, demonstrated good light-harvesting capabilities
over the visible to near-IR spectrum, especially in the range of 400–500
nm.

in water (red) and in EMIMBF4 (black). The blue line is
the photocurrent response of the SnO2/ITO substrate in
EMIMBF4.

The electrodes were further
checked by scanning electron microscopy
to examine the surface morphology after photoelectrochemical measurement.
Our previous speculation was also confirmed by Figure 4A. The perovskite films dissolved in water,
leaving a nearly naked SnO2 layer on the surface. It is
suggested that lead halide perovskite is unstable in aqueous solution
due to its ionic material character. Figure 4B is the SEM image of perovskite films after
EMIMBF4 dipping. Different from that in water, the films
in EMIMBF4 did not dissolve. Instead, a wood chiplike structure
formed on the surface.

(A) water
and (B) EMIMBF4 for 3 min.

To get a more in-depth understanding of the role of EMIMBF4, we compared the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the
pristine perovskite films and the films after EMIMBF4 immersion
(Figure 5A). The diffraction
peaks of the pristine films were observed at 2θ = 14.2 and 28.5°
and assigned to the (110) and (220) crystal planes of the orthorhombic
lattice of perovskite, respectively.31 The
average crystalline size of the pristine film estimated from the full
width at half-maximum of the (110) peak is approximately 50 nm. The
diffraction peak at 30° is associated with the substrate because
it is also observed in the SnO2 XRD spectrum (Figure S2). Surprisingly, after EMIMBF4 dipping, characteristic peaks of the orthorhombic lattice of perovskite
disappeared. In addition, it should be noted that there was no PbI2 peak at 12.65°, indicating that the perovskite films
did not decompose. Figure 5B is the FTIR spectra of the perovskite films before and after
EMIMBF4 immersion. The spectra revealed that IL molecules
were adsorbed on the surface of the perovskite films, as indicated
by the absorption bands in the region of 1600–1450 cm–1, which were assigned to C=C stretching of the imidazolium
ring. The bands at 1460 and 1380 cm–1 were attributed
to C–H in-plane bending vibration of methyl. The findings of
both the C=C and C–H undeformation modes suggests that
EMIMBF4 was loaded successfully on the surface but did
not participate in the formation of the new perovskite films. EMIMBF4 molecules may have just assembled on the surface of perovskites
and the change of surface morphology may result from the partial dissolution
and recrystallization of perovskite in EMIMBF4 solution.27

EMIMBF4 immersion. (B) The FTIR spectra of (i) the perovskite
films,

Figure S3 presents the morphology of
the deposited SnO2 on the ITO surface, where a pinhole-free
film with a grain size of 10–15 nm can be clearly observed.
As mentioned in Introduction, the design of
the SnO2 ETL is crucial in determining the performance
of the photovoltaic devices. To fabricate an efficient planar perovskite/SnO2/ITO for PEC sensing, the thickness of the SnO2 layer is also optimized in our work. Figure 6 is the response of the work electrodes with
different thicknesses of various SnO2 layers. The results
demonstrated that the photocurrent first increased with SnO2 and began to fall when the mass fraction of SnO2 exceeded
10 wt %. The possible reason for the phenomenon is that thinner SnO2 ETL is unable to completely cover the ITO surface and thicker
SnO2 ETL tends to form pinholes. Either the exposed ITO
grain or the pinholes in the SnO2 surface are unfavorable
to the devices,32 which will facilitate
photocurrent recombination leading to a low photocurrent. Therefore,
the optimal concentration of SnO2 in our work is 10 wt
%, which corresponds to the 100 nm SnO2 layer in the PEC
devices.

Figure 6 Photocurrent responses of the perovskite films spin-coated on the
SnO2/ITO substrate. The mass fraction of SnO2 from (a) to (f) are: 10, 15, 5, 3, 1, and 0%. The inset is a plot
of the photocurrent intensity as a function of the mass fraction of
SnO2. Error bars represent the standard deviation of three
replicate electrodes. Measurements were performed in EMIMBF4 solution.

To investigate the potential
applications of the fabricated photoelectrochemical
devices in analytical chemistry, hemin was selected as the model analyte.
It is well known that hemin, an iron-containing porphyrin for a diverse
group of proteins, participates in redox reactions reversibly with
the valence state transformation of the iron ion.33 Photocurrent responses of the perovskite/SnO2/ITO electrodes with different concentrations of hemin in EMIMBF4 are illustrated in Figure 7. Clearly, the photocurrent decreased monotonically
with the increase of hemin, suggesting hemin may hinder the photoelectric
conversion process. Upon irradiation, free electrons generated in
perovskite films will inject into the conduction band (CB) of SnO2 and then be transported to the conducting ITO electrode,
resulting in an anodic current. When hemin is present in the electrolyte,
Fe3+ in hemin will serve as an oxidizer to compete for
the photogenerated electrons and lead to a decrease of the photocurrent.
Therefore, it is feasible to quantify hemin with the intensity of
the photocurrent. Using this strategy, other chemicals can be detected
because they have appropriate energy levels and can participate in
the photoelectric conversion process.

were performed in EMIMBF4 solution.

Conclusions
In summary, this work demonstrated a convenient
way to fabricate
the perovskite/SnO2/ITO electrode. The photocurrent response
of the electrodes was stable in EMIMBF4 solution. The morphology
changes of the perovskite films in EMIMBF4 may be partly
due to dissolution and recrystallization. Additionally, the photoelectric
performance of the electrodes is closely related to the thickness
of the SnO2 ETL and the optimum thickness of the electron
transporting layer was set at 100 nm. The as-fabricated photoelectrochemical
device had a photocurrent response to hemin, which was chosen as the
model analyte. In principle, this strategy demonstrates a first step
toward the development of designing perovskite-based sensors in future.

Methods
Chemicals
and Materials
The following were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO): 33 wt % methylamine (CH3NH2) in absolute ethanol, 57 wt % hydroiodic acid (HI)
in water, PbCl2, and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate
was purchased from Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics. Tin (IV)
oxides (15 wt %), as a colloidal dispersion of 15 nm particles in
water, were obtained from Alfa Aesar (Ward Hill, MA). All other chemicals
and solvents were analytical grade reagents. Solutions were prepared
in high-purity water from a water purification system (Smart-P, Heal
Force, China). Indium-tin oxide (ITO) conductive glass was supplied
by Weiguang Corp (Shenzhen, China).

Preparation of Perovskite
Films
Methylamine iodide
(CH3NH3I) was synthesized by a solution reaction
of 24 mL methylamine (33 wt % in ethanol), 10 mL hydroiodic acid (57
wt % in water), and 100 mL ethanol by stirring for 1 h under nitrogen
at room temperature. The precipitate was then collected by evaporation
and washed with diethyl ether three times. After drying at 40 °C
in a vacuum oven overnight, CH3NH3I was dissolved
in anhydrous DMF with PbCl2 at a molar ratio of 3:1 to
form the halide perovskite precursor solution.

ITO glass substrates
were ultrasonically cleaned in detergent (15 min), deionized water
(5 min, twice), acetone (5 min), isopropanol (5 min), and deionized
water (5 min, twice), and dried in an oven at 80 °C for 60 min.
The compact SnO2 electron transport layer was implemented
by spin-coating the prepared SnO2 colloidal nanoparticles
on the clean ITO conducting glass and sintered at 450 °C for
1.5 h to remove surfactants and improve crystallinity. The thickness
of the SnO2 layer was manipulated by adjusting the concentration
of SnO2 colloidal nanoparticles.

The perovskite films
were prepared by spin-coating the precursor
solution on the SnO2/ITO glass substrate at 1500 rpm for
45 s, followed by a thermal treatment at 100 °C for 45 min. After
the precursor solution deposition, a transparent, yellow film was
formed on the SnO2/ITO substrate. After annealing, the
films changed color to dark brown. Next, scanning electron microscope
(SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) were conducted to characterize morphology and components of
the perovskite films. It is worth mentioning that the procedures of
device fabrication were almost completed in ambient air.

PEC Measurement
The photocurrent was measured on a
CHI 440C electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments, Austin, TX) by
placing the working electrode in a freshly prepared EMIMBF4 electrolyte, using a Pt flag as the counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl
(3 M KCl) as the reference electrode. After MAPbI3/SnO2/ITO was dipped into 2 mL of EMIMBF4 for 3 min,
a bias voltage of +0.4 V was applied to carry out PEC measurement.
The area of the working electrode in contact with the electrolyte
was 0.25 cm2. The light source for photocurrent measurement
was a 473 nm blue laser with 1.5 mW/cm2 power and an illumination
area of 0.18 cm2.
