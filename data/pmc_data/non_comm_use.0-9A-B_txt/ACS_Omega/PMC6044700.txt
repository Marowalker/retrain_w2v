1 Introduction
Theranostics,
the seamless combination of therapy and diagnostics
into a single construct, has become an active area of research in
the field of nanomedicine.1,2 This combination offers
to provide more personalized treatment, specific to the molecular
phenotype of the disease, to improve patient outcomes, and to reduce
off-target effects.3 Recent advances in
nanotechnology and the unique properties of nanoparticles make them
ideal for the use as theranostic agents, combining an imaging modality
with a therapeutic function.1,4 Plasmonic nanoparticles
are one class of nanoparticles that have been used extensively in
imaging applications.5

The strong
electromagnetic field enhancement produced by plasmonic
particles under appropriate excitation light can be used for surface-enhanced
Raman scattering (SERS), a very sensitive and specific spectroscopic
technique.6,7 Recent advances in the synthesis and modification
of nanoparticles have brought about the use of Raman dye-labeled nanoparticles
as contrast agents in in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo studies.8−10 It has been shown that SERS tags can be as bright as fluorescent
tags, while not suffering from photobleaching effects.11 SERS tags are also more suitable for multiplex
detection, exhibiting sharp, fingerprint-like spectra, in contrast
to the broad, featureless emission spectra of fluorescent tags.12

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising
treatment for a variety
of diseases, including cancer.13 When a
photosensitizer is activated with the appropriate wavelength of light,
it can undergo intersystem crossing to an excited triplet state. In
the presence of molecular oxygen (3O2), the
photosensitzer in its excited triplet state can transfer its energy,
producing singlet oxygen (1O2) and other cytotoxic
reactive oxygen species, destroying cells in the immediate vicinity.14 One of the main obstacles to applying PDT clinically
is the inactivation or poor solubility of the photosensitizer in biological
environments.15,16 Loading of the photosensitizer
onto a nanoparticle can overcome these problems by both protecting
the molecule from degradation and acting as a carrier for delivery
to the intended target.17

To create
a true theranostic construct, the ability to detect and
treat must be specific to a subtype of cells. Folic acid (FA) is one
of the most common targeting ligands employed for the nanoparticle
delivery.18 Many cancer cells overexpress
the folate receptor (FR), whereas normal cells typically have little
to no FR expression. By functionalizing the surface of our nanoparticles
with FA, they can be used to specifically label FR-positive cells
for detection by SERS, followed by PDT.

In this report, we present
the synthesis of a FR-targeted theranostic
nanoparticle. The diagnostic aspect of the construct comes from a
silver-embedded gold nanostar that acts as a SERS tag for Raman imaging.
Photosensitizer molecules are loaded onto the SERS tag by encapsulating
them in a silica shell for PDT. Selective detection and treatment
of the FR-positive cells are demonstrated using HeLa cervical cancer
and SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells.19−21 MDA-MB-468 breast cancer
cells are used as a FR-negative control.19,20

2 Results and Discussion
The nanotheranostic
agent presented in this study was synthesized
by combining different aspects from our previously developed protocols.
The gold nanostars were prepared using a modified version of the surfactant-free
nanostar procedure that was first reported from our laboratory.22 By adding silver nitrate immediately before
ascorbic acid (AA), batch-to-batch variability is reduced when compared
with simultaneous addition. Figure 1A shows transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images
of the gold nanostars that were prepared and subsequently functionalized
with para-mercaptobenzoic acid (pMBA). As shown in our recent report, pMBA-labeled
gold nanostars can be coated with silver, embedding pMBA between the gold and silver surfaces and generating high SERS
enhancement of the embedded dye.23 The
silver-embedded gold nanostars are shown in Figure 1B. A silica shell was then coated on the
silver-embedded gold nanostars to load the photosensitizer, protoporphyrin
IX (PpIX), onto the nanoparticles.24 The
silica shell also allows for amine modification with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane
(APTES), which is easily conjugated to FA–polyethyleneglycol–N-hydroxysuccinimide (FA–PEG–NHS) to provide
both stability in biological environments and FR-targeting capability.
A schematic overview of the nanoparticle synthesis can be found in Scheme 1. A TEM micrograph
of the final theranostic construct is shown in Figure 1C.

Scheme 1 Schematic Representation of the Nanoconstruct Synthesis
Gold nanostars are first labeled
with the Raman dye pMBA. Silver coating is performed
by reducing silver nitrate with AA, embedding pMBA
between the gold core and silver shell. The photosensitizer, PpIX,
is loaded onto the nanoparticles by encapsulation within a silica
shell, achieved by adding PpIX during the condensation reaction of
the silica precursor, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS). Targeting functionality
is realized by the conjugation of FA to the outer surface of the silica
shell.

A representative SERS spectrum of the pMBA-embedded
particles is presented in Figure 1D, showing the characteristic 1076 and 1580 cm–1 Raman peaks of pMBA ring breathing
and stretching, respectively.25 The silver-embedded
nanoparticles were also characterized using UV/vis absorption spectroscopy
(Figure 1E), before
(dotted) and after (solid) silica coating and functionalization. The
plasmon peak shifts from 506 to 514 nm after silica coating, as expected
owing to the increase in refractive index around the particles.26 The absorption and emission spectra of the photosensitizer
PpIX are shown in Figure 1F. The amount of PpIX encapsulated in the silica shell was
estimated using the fluorescence intensity of PpIX remaining in the
supernatant after silica coating (Figure S1). An estimated 0.33 ± 0.03 μM PpIX (33% loading efficiency
of the initial 1 μM) was loaded onto 0.1 nM of particles, which
is in good agreement with our previous report.24 The efficiency of the FA conjugation was determined spectrophotometrically
(Figure S2). It was found that 0.204 ±
0.007 mg of the initial 2 mg FA–PEG–NHS was incorporated
onto the particles, providing a conjugation efficiency of about 10%.
The particle size distribution was measured using nanoparticle tracking
analysis (NTA) (Figure 1G) and found no significant aggregation of particles either before
(dotted) or after (solid) silica coating and functionalization.

An in vitro demonstration of SERS-based diagnostics was performed.
Two FR-positive cell lines (HeLa and SK-BR-3) and one FR-negative
cell line (MDA-MB-468) were used. The cells were incubated with the
folate-conjugated nanocomposite for 4 h in a fresh medium. Following
the incubation period, cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) before being fixed and dried for imaging. In this case,
the cells were fixed because our Raman microscope is not set up to
perform live cell measurements. If equipped with a microscope incubator
chamber, the SERS detection could be carried out on live samples.
The cell sample was placed on the microscope stage, and the cells
were located using a 10× objective. An area for Raman mapping
was designated in the microscope software (white boxes in Figure 2). Raman spectra
were acquired at each point in a grid across the sample at 20 μm
step sizes. The intensity of the 1076 cm–1 Raman
peak of pMBA was then used to generate the false-color
Raman maps by integrating the signal to baseline from 1050 to 1100
cm–1 in the WiRE software. The color scale between
all three samples was kept the same. As shown in Figure 2, both HeLa and SK-BR-3 samples
show high signal intensity from the FA-targeted nanoparticles, with
a low background signal outside of the cell-containing region. As
expected, the MDA-MD-468 samples only show a background level of SERS
signal following particle incubation. These results demonstrate the
selective detection of FR-positive cells using the developed theranostic
construct. To confirm that the high SERS intensity of the FR-positive
cells is due to targeting and not due to different rates of nanoparticle
uptake between the cell lines, a control experiment with an untargeted
theranostic construct was performed (Figure S3). It was observed that none of the cell lines showed a strong SERS
signal after the 4 h incubation period with the untargeted nanoparticles,
indicating that there is not a significant rate of nanoparticle uptake
by any of the cell lines in the time frame studied.

Figure 2 Raman mapping of the
three different cell lines after 4 h incubation
with the FA-targeted theranostic nanoparticles at 0.1 nM concentration.
The sample was scanned in a grid pattern with 20 μm step size,
taking a 1 s acquisition at each point. The Raman peak intensity at
each point was then integrated to create the false-color Raman map
that is overlaid on the brightfield image. The FR-positive cell lines
(HeLa and SK-BR-3) show high Raman intensity coming from the cluster
of cells, whereas the FR-negative cell line (MDA-MB-468) shows little
to no Raman signal. Scale bars are 100 × 50 μm.

The cells used for PDT were treated with particles
in the same
manner as those for SERS detection. Instead of being fixed after PBS
washing, a fresh medium was replenished. An area of cells was focused
on with a 40× objective and then exposed to filtered red light
(640/30 nm) from a mercury arc lamp for 15 s; the power measured at
the sample was 11.5 mW. After irradiation, the cells were returned
to the incubator for 4 h before live/dead staining. The results of
the PDT can be seen in Figure 3. The complete theranostic construct (row 1) showed almost
complete cell death for HeLa, a high percentage of cell death for
SK-BR-3, and little to no cell death for MDA-MD-468. The amount of
cell death in the SK-BR-3 sample is likely underestimated, as many
of the cells in the irradiated area became detached, as observed in Figure 3. The SK-BR-3 cells
may be more sensitive to environmental stresses than the HeLa cells,
causing them to detach after PDT. Otherwise, these results are what
was expected based on the FR expression of the cell lines.

Figure 3 Cell viability
staining after PDT with the theranostic construct,
a targeted theranostic construct without drug control and an untargeted
theranostic construct with drug control. All cells were incubated
with the nanoparticle samples at 0.1 nM concentration for 4 h. The
scale of each image is ∼1.86 × 1.24 mm2. The
number of live and dead cells in the irradiated area, compared with
nonirradiated cells, was used to create the histogram displayed to
the right of the cell images. Error bars are one standard deviation
(n = 4).

To verify that the cell death was due to PDT rather than
photothermal
or other light-induced effects, the targeted nanoparticle construct
without PpIX was used as a control (row 2). As shown, there is no
cell death after irradiation in the absence of PpIX. Likewise, without
FA for targeting (row 3), there are not enough particles uptaken by
cells during the incubation period to cause any PDT effects after
irradiation. The biocompatibility of the theranostic construct was
evaluated using a resazurin-based cell viability assay after the 4
h incubation period (Figure S3). There
is a slight decrease in the cell viability measured after particle
incubation; however, none of the observed differences were found to
be statistically significant.

3 Experimental Section
3.1 Materials
All chemicals were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) at the highest purity grade available
unless otherwise specified. Ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH;
50% v/v) and ethanol (EtOH; 200 proof) were obtained from VWR (Radnor,
PA). FA–PEG–NHS was acquired from Nanocs Inc. (New York,
NY). All cell culture reagents, fluorescein diacetate (FDA), propidium
iodide (PI), and PBS were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).
Ultrapure deionized (DI) water (>18 MΩ·cm) was used
in
all preparations.

3.2 Instrumentation
TEM was performed
on a FEI Tecnai G2 Twin (Hillsboro, OR). Particle size
distribution and concentration were measured using NTA with a NanoSight
NS500 instrument (Malvern, Worcestershire, UK). Raman spectra were
acquired using a Renishaw inVia Raman microscope (Gloucestershire,
UK), equipped with a 633 nm He–Ne laser. UV/vis spectra and
fluorescence intensity were recorded on a FLUOstar Omega plate reader
(BMG Labtech GmbH, Germany). Fluorescent emission spectra were recorded
on an Edinburgh Photonics FLS920 fluorescence spectrometer (Livingston,
UK). Folic acid absorption spectra were acquired with a Shimadzu UV-3600
spectrophotometer (Columbia, MD). Photodynamic therapy treatment and
cell viability imaging were performed on an inverted microscope with
a mercury arc lamp and appropriate filter cubes. Cell images were
acquired with a Canon EOS Rebel XTi (Tokyo, Japan) mounted on the
front port of the microscope.

3.3 SERS-Labeled
Nanoparticle Synthesis
Gold nanostars were synthesized as
previously reported. In brief,
10 μL of 1 N HCl was added to 10 mL of 0.25 mM HAuCl4 under vigorous stirring. Then, 100 μL of 12 nm gold seed,
50 μL of 2 mM AgNO3, and 50 μL of 0.1 M AA
were added in rapid succession. The color of the solution changes
from orange–red to blue–gray within seconds. A final
concentration of 20 μM pMBA and 0.02% Tween
20 was added to the as-prepared particles and allowed to gently stir
for 24 h. The solution was again brought to a rapid stir before adding
50 μL of 0.1 M AgNO3, 50 μL of 0.1 M AA, and
10 μL of NH4OH in sequence. Once thoroughly mixed,
gentle stirring was continued overnight. The solution gradually changed
to a highly scattering, deep red color. A 5 μM final concentration
of thiol-PEG 5k was added and allowed to react for 1 h. The particles
were washed by centrifugation/resuspension (3k rcf, 15 min) in water
three times and finally redispersed into 1 mL of water.

3.4 Silica Coating and PpIX Embedding
The SERS-labeled
nanoparticles were coated with silica using a modified
Stöber method.1 1 mL of concentrated
nanoparticles was added to 8 mL of EtOH, and 1 mL of DI in a 15 mL
centrifuge tube and was mixed. A final concentration of 1 μM
protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), 30 μL of 10% TEOS, and 200 μL
of NH4OH was then added, mixed, and kept undisturbed overnight
to form PpIX-embedded silica shells on the particles. The silica-coated
particles were washed in ethanol three times (3k rcf, 15 min) and
redispersed into 8 mL of EtOH and 2 mL of DI.

3.5 Folic
Acid Functionalization
The
particles were first modified with APTES to provide free amine groups
on the particle surface. A 1 μL aliquot of APTES was added to
the EtOH/DI particle suspension and allowed to react for 6 h. The
APTES-modified particles were washed four times in EtOH and resuspended
in 1 mL of PBS. To this solution, 2 mg of FA–PEG–NHS
was added and mixed until dissolved. The reaction was allowed to proceed
overnight at room temperature. The FA-functionalized particles were
washed three times (3k rcf, 10 min) in PBS with 0.02% Tween 20, with
final resuspension in 1 mL of PBS (particle concentration ≈
1 nM).

3.6 Cell Culture and Nanoparticle Incubation
HeLa, SK-BR-3, and MDA-MB-468 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas,
VA). All three cell lines were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle medium (Gibco, 11995065), supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum, and grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing
5% CO2. For PDT experiments, cells were seeded into six-well
plates and grown to ∼90% confluency before use. For Raman mapping
experiments, cells were seeded into glass-bottomed 35 mm dishes and
grown to ∼50% confluency before use.

Immediately before
particle incubation, the old medium was aspirated and replaced with
a fresh medium. To each well, 100 μL of 1 nM nanoparticle solution
in PBS was added, and the cells were returned to the incubator for
4 h. The cells were then washed three times with PBS to remove any
unbound particles, and the fresh medium was replenished.

Toxicity
of the theranostic nanoparticles was measured with a resazurin-based
metabolic assay (TOX8, Sigma). Cells were incubated with particles
for 4 h, washed in PBS, and then had fresh medium added. The next
day, 10% volume of resazurin solution was added to each well and allowed
to incubate for 2 h. The fluorescence intensity was then measured
per the manufacturer’s protocol.

3.7 Photodynamic
Therapy
The cells were
irradiated for 15 s on a microscope using a filtered (640/30 nm) mercury
lamp through a 40× objective, with a power of 11.5 mW at the
sample. After treatment, the cells were placed back in the incubator
for 4 h before staining. Live/dead staining was performed using FDA
and PI in PBS at 50 and 1 μg/mL, respectively. The live/dead
cells in the treated area were counted to produce the cell viability
histogram.

3.8 Raman Mapping
After nanoparticle
incubation, the cells were fixed in cold methanol for 15 min, rinsed
with water, and allowed to dry. A Renishaw inVia Raman microscope
equipped with a 633 nm He–Ne laser, running WiRE 2.0 software,
was used to acquire the Raman spectra. Cells were located under brightfield
transillumination with a 10× objective. The motorized stage was
then set to scan the sample in a grid pattern while acquiring a spectrum
at each point. The grating was set to 1100 cm–1,
and the exposure time was 1 s. The false-color Raman maps were created
by integrating the signal to baseline of the 1076 cm–1 Raman peak of pMBA from 1050 to 1100 cm–1 in the WiRE 2.0 software.

4 Conclusions
In summary, we report the synthesis of a FR-targeted theranostic
nanocomposite for SERS-based detection and PDT. The selective detection
of FR-positive cells was demonstrated using Raman imaging, showing
a high SERS signal from the FR-positive cells and little to no signal
from the FR-negative cells. The selective therapeutic effect was demonstrated
by performing an in vitro PDT study. Again, only the FR-positive cells
were affected by the treatment. The HeLa cells in the irradiated area
were almost completely dead, and the SK-BR-3 cells showed a high percentage
of cell death, even though many of the cells detached from the treatment
area. The FR-negative MDA-MD-468 cells showed no cell death in the
irradiated area. These data suggest that the silica-coated, silver-embedded
gold nanostars are a promising platform for the development of future
theranostic agents. Use of other small-molecule Raman dyes can provide
the particles with unique SERS spectra for the application in multiplex
detection when combined with other specific targeting agents, such
as antibodies.
