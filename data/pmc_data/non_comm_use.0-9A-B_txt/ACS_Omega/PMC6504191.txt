Fungal infections
can lead to severe clinical outcomes such as
multiple organ failure and septic shock. Rapid detection of fungal
infections allows clinicians to treat patients in a timely manner
and improves clinical outcomes. Conventional detection methods include
blood culture followed by plate culture and polymerase chain reaction.
These methods are time-consuming and require expensive equipment,
hence, they are not suitable for point-of-care and clinical settings.
There is an unmet need to develop a rapid and inexpensive detection
method for fungal infections such as candidemia. We developed an innovative
immuno-based microfluidic device that can rapidly detect and capture Candida albicans from phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
and human whole blood. Our microchip technology showed an efficient
capture of C. albicans in PBS with
an efficiency of 61–78% at various concentrations ranging from
10 to 105 colony-forming units per milliliter (cfu/mL).
The presented microfluidic technology will be useful to screen for
various pathogens at the point-of-care and clinical settings.

1 Introduction
Candida albicans (C. albicans) are human commensals of genitourinary
and gastrointestinal tracts, and skin.1 However, C. albicans is an opportunistic
fungal pathogen that can cause invasive fungal infections.2,3 Mortality associated with C. albicans infection is greater than 50% making Candida a leading cause of healthcare-associated bloodstream infections
in the United States.3 Neutrophils are
an essential element of the innate immune system. Low count of neutrophils
in blood (neutropenia) and its lengthy and repeated episodes provide
favorable conditions for Candida invasion,
especially in immunocompromised patients.4 Because of the lack of rapid diagnosis, these bloodstream infections
require prolonged hospital stays that significantly increase treatment
and hospitalization costs.3,5,6

Rapid detection of Candida is
urgently
needed, especially in the cases of preterm neonates and immunocompromised
patients; candidemia can lead to multiple organ failure and septic
shock.7−9 Conventionally, in hospital settings, about 10 mL
of blood from the patients is cultured in blood culture incubators
using specific media to culture either aerobic or anaerobic organism
(Figure 1).5 If the blood culture is positive, then pathogen
identification can be determined by follow-up pathogen cultures including
Sabouraud glucose agar and cornmeal agar.5 Chromogenic medium-based culture can further improve Candida differentiation as the medium contains chromogenic
substrates that react with enzymes produced by different pathogens
and produce colonies of varying colors and morphologies.10 Additionally, carbohydrate assimilation and
fermentation reactions can be used for Candida identification, however, the test takes up to 72 h incubation. Overall,
the conventional laboratory methods for Candida detection are highly time-consuming, which delays patient treatment
and can take 2–10 days.

Figure 1 Comparison of the conventional culture
method and the microchip-based C. albicans detection. In conventional procedure
for Candida detection in clinical settings,
the following protocol is followed; (1) blood sample is collected
from patients. (2) Blood samples are incubated in an automated blood
culture system. (3) Pathogens are grown on a Sabouraud glucose agar
plate. (4) Sample is subcultured into a Corn meal-Tween 80 agar plate
for morphological identification. In the point-of-care testing approach,
the following protocol is developed; (1) blood sample collection [spiked
with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing Candida as a model microorganism]. (2) Blood sample is analyzed in microchannels
functionalized with anti-Candida antibodies. Candida cells were specifically captured by antibodies
on the microchannel surface. Unbound Candida cells are washed away with PBS in the washing step. (3) GFP-Candida is imaged and quantified under a fluorescence
microscope. Some images are taken from freerangestock.com and pixabay.com.

It is important to rapidly diagnose fungal infections with
high
accuracy to initiate timely treatment. The nucleic acid real-time
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), nucleic acid sequence-based amplification
(NASBA), and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) methods
take around 3–6 h for detection of C.albicans. Microfluidic devices have emerged as a potential candidate for
rapid disease diagnostics in the current era.11−19 Although, microfluidic real-time PCR provides a rapid Candida detection,20 it
relies on thermal cycles and the effective monitoring and control
of various temperatures during experimentation are quite challenging.
The fluidic manipulations and utilization of magnetic beads also increase
the complexity of the devices. Table 1 shows comparison of different Candida detection technologies.

work with larger volumes with extended assay times.	
To overcome the limitations
of conventional culture-based Candida detection methods, we developed an inexpensive
microfluidic device functionalized with antibodies to C. albicans. This technology allows for rapid detection,
capture, and isolation of C. albicans in PBS and blood in an efficient manner. Low sample consumption
because of the higher surface to volume ratio of blood within the
microchannels supports rapid capturing of targeted pathogens. Our
device overcomes the limitation of long incubation times. We demonstrated
that C. albicans can be detected within
2 h at a minimum of 10 cfu/mL.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Microfluidic Device Fabrication
The
microfluidic device was fabricated by using plastics layers and polymer
adhesives as previously reported (Figure 2a,b).17 The design
for the device was created in AutoCAD 2015 and uploaded to the UCP
Software for cutting the device using a laser cutter. Poly(methyl
methacrylate) (PMMA) (McMaster-Carr, Atlanta, GA and ePlastics, San
Diego, CA 1.5 mm thick) and the double-sided adhesive (DSA) (3 M,
St. Paul, MN, 76 μm thick) were cut using a VLS 2.30 laser cutter
(VersaLaser, Scottsdale, AZ). In each microfluidic device, three parallel
channels (dimensions: 44 mm × 5 mm × 76 μm) were cut
in DSA. One side of the DSA film was attached to glass cover slide
[70% ethanol in distilled (DI) water and dried by nitrogen gas], whereas
other side was attached to a PMMA. Three inlet and three outlet holes
(0.65 mm diameter) were also cut in PMMA before assembly. The complete
assembled device is shown in (Figure 2b).

DSA,
and glass cover. (b) Actual image of the assembled microchip containing

surface chemistry was used to immobilize anti-Candida antibodies on the surface. (d) Fluorescent image showing clear green
signal (right side of microchannel) that indicates successful immobilization

2.2 Microfluidic Channel Surface
Functionalization
with Antibodies
Protein G-based surface chemistry was used
to immobilize antibodies (Figure 2c). Protein G is an immunoglobulin-binding protein
that binds to the fragment crystallization region of antibodies with
high efficiency. For surface functionalization, glass cover slide
was cleaned with 70% ethanol in DI water and dried by nitrogen gas.
Glass cover slide was then treated with oxygen plasma (100 W, 1% oxygen)
for 2 min in a PX-250 chamber (March instruments, Concord, MA) to
form the hydroxyl (OH) surface functional groups followed by a 30
min incubation with silanization solution [4% (v/v) 3-MPS ((3-mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane,
CN: 175617)) in ethanol] in a Petri dish at room temperature for covalent
binding. After incubation, the cover slide was washed with ethanol
and was allowed to dry for 3–4 min at room temperature. The
microfluidic device was assembled by sandwiching DSA between PMMA
and cover slide. Channels were washed 3 times with PBS. GMBS (N-g-maleimidobutyryloxy succinimide ester)
solution (4% (w/v) GMBS dissolved in 10% DMSO in PBS) was pipetted
into microfluidic channels. Devices were incubated for 30 min at room
temperature. From now onward, channels were washed 3 times with PBS
after each incubation step. Then Protein G (1 mg/mL in PBS, Thermo
Fisher Scientific) was pipetted into microfluidic channels followed
by 2 h incubation at 4 °C. For capturing C. albicans, we tested two different anti-Candida antibodies; one was monoclonal (Abcam, ab82704) and the second was
polyclonal (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Catalog: PA1-27158). Then 30
μL (5 μg/mL solution) of each anti-C. albicans antibody was pipetted into each microchannel followed by a 1 h incubation
at room temperature. Microchannels were washed with PBS 3 times. Then
2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS was injected into microchannels
followed by 30 min incubation at room temperature and subsequent washing
with PBS was performed. The devices were ready for Candida capture experiments.

2.3 C. albicans Strain and Growth
To validate
the surface chemistry and
isolation experiments, a genetically modified C. albicans, SC5314, expressing GFP was used.32C. albicans was grown to the log phase in yeast extract–peptone–dextrose
medium overnight at 30 °C in a shaker incubator at 250 rpm.33 Yeast was harvested, washed, and resuspended
in PBS and blood for use. The initial Candida count was determined first by haemocytometer. Then, C. albicans were thoroughly mixed with PBS/blood
to obtain a homogeneous solution. After Candida capture experiments, counting was performed manually. The counting
approach was optimized (Figure S1). Capture
efficiency was calculated by dividing the number of Candida cells captured by number of Candida cell spiked. Only 50 μL of the Candida-spiked sample was used for these experiments. Candida counts were normalized to the sample volume
used.

2.4 Sample Preparation for Microfluidic Experiments
GFP-expressing C. albicans (GFP-Candida) was spiked into 1× PBS and whole blood
with the final concentrations ranging from 10 to 5 × 105 cfu/mL for analysis on the chip. Discarded deidentified whole blood
(purchased from Research Blood Components, LLC, Cambridge, MA) from
healthy individuals was used in this study. For lysed blood experiments,
we did the following: (1) GPF-Candida cells were spiked into whole blood at 5 × 105 cfu/mL
and mixed thoroughly by inverting to enable homogenous distribution.
(2) The spiked blood sample was mixed with ACK (ammonium–chloride–potassium)
lysis buffer at 1:10 ratio (v/v) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A1049201)
and incubated for 3 min at room temperature. Candida cells remained intact in ACK lysis buffer. This is primarily because
of the chitin found in their cell wall.34 (3) Centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 3 min was performed; Candida cell remained intact and made a pellet. (4)
Supernatant was aspirated, leaving approximately 50 μL to avoid
disturbing the pellet. Then, 5 mL of PBS was added followed by 3000
rpm centrifugation (3 min) and the supernatant was aspirated again
leaving approximately 50 μL of the sample including pellet.
(5) The pellet was disturbed with a pipette and mixed gently. The
complete blood lysis and Candida enrichment
process take about 10 min.

2.5 Operation of Microfluidic
Experiments, Candida Capture, and Quantification
To optimize
the capture efficiency, 50 μL of the GFP-Candida sample was pipetted into the functionalized microchannels, and then
incubated at ambient temperature for 15 min. Following the incubation,
microchannels were washed with PBS at a flow rate of 5 or 10 μL/min
using a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) for 60 min.
After washing, captured GFP-Candida was imaged using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Observer
optical microscope) through a GFP fluorescence filter (excitation
wavelength 470 nm). For comparison, bright-field images were also
taken (Figure 5c).
All images were taken (Figure 5c and 5d) with 10× objective except Figure 5e (100× objective).
The number of GFP-Candida detected
using a GFP filter was counted manually.

2.6 Statistical
Analysis
Statistical
analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).
Each experiment was repeated at least three times. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

3 Results
We developed a microfluidic device
having 3 microchannels functionalized
with protein G-based surface chemistry (Figure 2). The microfluidic channels provide a high
surface to volume ratio that would allow efficient Candida capture on the surface of the channel. 3MPS–GMBS
(3-mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane-N-g-maleimidobutyryloxy succinimide ester)-based surface chemistry was
used to immobilize protein on the microchannels of the device as previously
reported.17 The reaction between the amine
group and GMBS allow protein immobilization. To determine protein
conjugation to the surface of microchannels, we incubated FITC-conjugated
protein inside microchannel after the GMBS step. The channels were
washed with PBS after 2 h of incubation at 4 °C. We visualized
fluorescence using the fluorescent microscope, which showed that protein
was successfully immobilized inside microchannels (Figure 2d).

COMSOL simulations
were performed to determine the effects of shear
stress on the C. albicans captured
inside the microfluidic device. A single Candida cell was modeled as a spherical-shaped object (radius 6 μm).
The microfluidic device with exact dimensions was considered and a
laminar flow was assumed. The no slip boundary condition was applied
to the walls of the microfluidic channel. Two flow rates (5 and 10
μL/min) were assumed. A boundary condition with pressure = 0
was set for the outlet. The Naiver–Stokes equation was used
to simulate the motion of fluid past the captured Candida. Various simulations were carried out to calculate the velocity
and pressure profiles. The velocity magnitude and streamlines are
shown in Figure 3a,b,
respectively. The shear stress was measured for the two flow rates
(5 and 10 μL/min) and drag force was also calculated. The value
of drag force was 20.47 pN for 5 μL/min. When the flow rate
was increased to 10 μL/min, drag force became 40.96 pN. Higher
flow rates resulted in increased drag force on the captured Candida. This increase in drag force reduces the
capture efficiency of Candida as also
observed in experiments (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Comparison of the capture efficiency of C. albicans by two different anti-Candida antibodies;
polyclonal and monoclonal. The Candida sample was incubated inside microchannels to allow binding with
a functionalized surface for 15 min at room temperature. (a) Capture
efficiency was significantly higher when the washing step was performed
at (a) 5 μL/min as compared to (b) 10 μL/min.

We evaluated two different antibodies (monoclonal
and polyclonal)
for their efficiency to capture C. albicans from spiked samples inside microfluidic channels. The capture efficiency
via polyclonal anti-Candida antibodies
(77.4 ± 4.4%) was observed to be significantly higher (p-value < 0.05) than monoclonal anti-Candida antibodies (48.6 ± 2.8%) (Figure 4a). For all further experiments, we used
polyclonal antibody because of its higher capture efficiency compared
to monoclonal.

We observed that the 5 μL/min flow rate
(during washing)
gave significantly higher capture efficiencies compared to 10 μL/min
(Figure 4). The lower
efficiency observed at higher flow rates may be related to the correspondingly
higher shear stress within the microchannels as also shown in simulation
graphs (Figure 3).
For all further experiments, we used a flow rate of 5 μL/min.

To determine microchip’s limit of detection for Candida capture, we spiked GFP-Candida into PBS at various clinically relevant concentrations ranging from
10 to 105 cfu/mL (Figure 5).35−37

Figure 5 (a) Capture efficiency

channels functionalized with polyclonal
antibodies at various concentrations ranging from 100 to 100 000
cfu/mL. We processed 50 μL of spiked PBS. (b) Capture efficiency
of Candida was increased when 1 mL
of the spiked PBS sample was processed by injecting 50 μL sample
multiple times in the same channel followed by incubation after each
injection. (c) Image of the captured GFP-Candida inside microchannel at 10× magnification under bright field.
(d) Image of the captured GFP-Candida inside microchannel at 10× magnification under a fluorescence
microscope. (e) Image of the captured GFP-Candida at 100× magnification under a fluorescence microscope.

In the first set of experiments,
we tested only 50 μL of
the spiked PBS sample. We observed similar capture efficiencies of
77.4 ± 4.4, 61 ± 12.7, and 70 ± 13.2% for 105, 104, and 103 cfu/mL samples respectively,
however, capture efficiency was reduced to 30 ± 14.2% for the
102 cfu/mL sample. One possible reason for lower capture
efficiency in the case of the 102 cfu/mL sample may have
originated from losing Candida during
sampling from 1 mL to 50 μL. To investigate this hypothesis,
we tested whole 1 mL of spiked samples and observed higher capture
efficiencies of 78 ± 13.2 and 75 ± 21.1% for 102 and 10 cfu/mL samples (Figure 5b). From these results, we observed that increasing
the sample volume resulted in increase in capture efficiencies at
lower concentration samples (10 and 102 cfu/mL).

To further investigate the effect of the sample matrix and the
presence of other cells on the capture efficiency, we spiked 105 cfu/mL GFP-Candida into whole
human blood and processed the sample using the microfluidic device.
We observed the capture efficiency of 40.5 ± 4.7% from blood
samples (Figure 6),
which was significantly lower than when spiked PBS was used 77.4 ±
4.4%. This decrease in capture efficiency from the blood sample may
be due to the presence of millions of blood cells that hindered Candida–antibody interactions. To overcome
the effect of blood cells, we lysed the spiked blood sample and isolated
the pellet as described in the Materials and Methods section. The pellet containing Candida cells was mixed and processed through the microfluidic device. We
observed significantly higher capture efficiency of 74.6 ± 6.8%
compared to the spiked whole blood sample.

Figure 6 (a) Capture efficiency
of GFP-C. albicans cells inside microfluidic
channels functionalized with polyclonal
antibodies from 16 μL of whole and lysed blood. Blood was lysed
after spiking GFP-Candida. (b) Image
of the captured GFP-Candida from whole
blood inside the microchannel at 10× magnification under a fluorescence
microscope. (c) Image of the captured GFP-Candida from lysed blood inside microchannel at 10× magnification under
a fluorescence microscope. GFP-Candida was spiked into blood at the concentration of 105 cfu/mL.

To show that the developed microfluidic
device can be used to capture
unstained Candida from samples, unstained Candida spiked in buffer (not expressing GFP) was
utilized. Precapture and postcapture staining were performed with
FITC conjugated anti-Candida antibody
(ab21164). The results are shown in the Figure S2. C. albicans not producing
GFP were initially captured using the polyclonal antibody. Then staining
was performed with FITC-conjugated anti-Candida antibody. The capture efficiency was recorded 68.8 ± 6.8%.
It was observed that precapture staining resulted in lower capture
efficiency, that is, 43.2 ± 4.5%. One possible reason can be
the blocking of some capture sites of the Candida strains. The C. albicans captured
by monoclonal antibody in the microfluidic channel were also stained
with the secondary antibody. The postcapture staining resulted in
a capture efficiency of 29.6 ± 5.7%. The precapture staining
resulted in slightly decreased capture efficiency 22.4 ± 4.5%.

4 Discussion
Using the developed microfluidic device,
we were able to efficiently
isolate and quantify C. albicans from
spiked PBS and whole blood sample. The whole capture experiment takes
about 1.5 h (in the case of PBS and whole blood) and less than 2 h
(in the case of blood lysis protocol). Following blood lysis protocol
developed herein, we were able to capture 74.6 ± 6.8% of Candida from blood samples in significantly lesser
time (2 h) as compared to conventional blood culture followed by plate
culture methods (more than a week) (Figure 1). There are other existing methods that
can detect Candida at lesser time than
conventional culture methods including PCR,38 magnetic resonance (T2Candida by T2 Biosystems),3,39 and
isothermal amplification methods such as LAMP,40,41 NASBA,42 and rolling circle amplification.43 PCR and isothermal amplification-based detection
provide high specificity and sensitivity; however, these approaches
are multistep, require sample purification, and nucleic acid extraction
prior to the detection step, a time-consuming process. More importantly,
during nucleic acid amplification Candida cells are lysed, hence viability of Candida cannot be tested and drug resistance and susceptibility cannot be
analyzed. The T2Candida system utilizes magnetic resonance to detect
aggregation of magnetic particles in the presence of the target.39 T2Candida also relies on amplification of genetic
information where nucleic acids are first isolated and purified from Candida cells using beads; however, T2Candida is
a sample-to-answer system where all the processing steps are automated.
This system provides high sensitivity and specificity and detection
can be performed in 3–5 h.3 However,
similar to other nucleic acid-based detection systems, Candida cells are lysed in T2Candida and drug resistance
and susceptibility testing cannot be performed, which are becoming
very important for personalized therapy. The developed microfluidic
device can address some of these limitations by allowing whole Candida capture directly from the lysed blood sample
as Candida cells are not lysed during
the isolation step, hence culture and drug resistance and susceptibility
testing may be possible.

Although blood is a complex biological
matrix; we have successfully
captured and detected spiked Candida using the microfluidic approach. The presented method can also be
applied to other matrices such as saliva and urine. In the case of
urinary tract infection, high concentration of Candida cells (104 to 105 cfu/mL)37 may be present in urine that can be rapidly isolated and
quantified using the developed microfluidic devices. In this study,
GFP-expressing C. albicans was used
to facilitate the detection and quantification under the fluorescent
microscope. The extension from a GFP-expressing Candida strain to wild-type strains can be simply achieved using an ELISA
or peptide nucleic acid-based fluorescence in situ hybridization (PNA-FISH)-based
detection method, as previously reported.44−46 The characterized
microchip can be integrated with rapid detection methods such as lensless
imaging17,47 and smartphone-based imaging48−50 to enable point-of-care testing. The presented microfluidic approach
can be adapted to detect other microorganisms that cause sepsis such
as Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.51 Also, the cost to fabricate one functionalized chip is significantly
lower than other assays (PCR, T2Candida); current material cost (excluding
other related costs such as labor and equipment cost) includes 10¢
of glass, 1¢ of PMMA, and 80¢ of antibodies per device.
The antibody cost could be lowered with large-scale production and
ordering.

5 Conclusions
To overcome the limitations
of culture-based detection methods
for fungal infections, we have developed a microfluidic immunoassay
to capture C. albicans (a Yeast) from
PBS and blood samples with reliable capture efficiency. We observed
that polyclonal antibody captured a significantly high number of Candida cells as compared to monoclonal antibody.
The washing flow rate can also affect final capture efficiency, and
we observed that a flow rate of 5 μL/min provides higher capture
efficiency as compared to 10 μL/min. To enable efficient detection
of Candida from blood samples, the
lysis step was used that significantly improved the capture efficiency
from whole blood samples. The presented technology allows the capture
and isolation of whole Candida cells,
hence enabling potentially drug resistance and susceptibility testing.
The microfluidic platform can be potentially adapted to detect various
other microorganisms and pathogens rapidly at the point-of-care settings.
