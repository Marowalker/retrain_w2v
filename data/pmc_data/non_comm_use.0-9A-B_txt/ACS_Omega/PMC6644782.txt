A flexible
and convergent strategy for the stereoselective total
synthesis of bioactive marine natural product cytospolide Q has been
developed. The key features of this synthesis include Evans anti-aldol
reaction for the installation of C-2 and C-3 stereocenters and cycloetherification
via epoxide opening followed by concomitant lactonization for the
construction of tetrahydrofuran and γ-butyrolactone scaffolds.
This synthetic study also revealed that protected oxygenated functionality
(methyl ester or benzyl ether) at C-1 position participated readily
in epoxide opening.

Introduction
Cytospolides belong
to a family of nonanolides which were isolated
by Zhang and co-workers during their bioassay-guided fractionation
study of a crude acetone extract of Cytospora sp., an endophytic fungus from an evergreen shrub (Ilex canariensis), collected from Gomera, Spain (1–8, Figure 1).1 Many of the members of this
family exhibited cytotoxic effects on different human cancer cell
lines. The structures and absolute configurations of these molecules
were elucidated using detailed spectroscopic analysis. Architecturally,
most of these members bear a 10-membered lactone except, cytospolide
Q (8). Technically, cytospolide Q (8) does
not belong to the nonanolide family. The proposed biogenetic pathway
suggests that cytospolide Q has been conceived through transesterification
reaction of cytospolide M (6) which is a tetrahydrofuran
(THF)-containing nonanolide.1 Bioactivities
and interesting structural features have rendered many of these natural
products attractive synthetic targets to the organic community.2 In continuation of our ongoing programs to the
chemical synthesis of bioactive natural products,3 especially the nonanolides,3f,3g we envisaged
the total synthesis of cytospolide Q. Structurally, it bears a unique
15 carbon skeleton embedded with a THF ring and a γ-butyrolactone
moiety. Cytospolide Q showed cytotoxicity against human lungs adenocarcinoma
(A549) with an IC50 value of 10.55 μg/mL.1b There is only one report on the total synthesis
of cytospolide Q.2g Stark et al. had developed
a nice strategy for its synthesis in 21 linear steps by mimicking
the biosynthetic pathway. However, the overall yield of their synthesis
was low (<1%). Furthermore, a partial epimerization of C-2 methyl
center of cytospolide Q was observed when the precursor of cytospolide
M was subjected for transesterification process in the presence of
base.2g Thus, there is a need to explore
other possible synthetic routes for cytospolide Q. In this paper,
we report a shorter and flexible synthetic route for the total synthesis
of the target molecule.

Figure 1 Some representative examples of cytospolides.

Results and Discussion
Retrosynthetic
analysis of cytospolide Q (8) is depicted
in Scheme 1. The THF
ring and the γ-butyrolactone moiety could be installed from
suitably protected epoxy ester 9 by a set of cascade
reactions: deprotection of the acetonide group followed by concomitant
cycloetherification via opening of the epoxide moiety followed by
γ-lactonization. The epoxy compound 9 could be
constructed from compound 10 using Sharpless asymmetric
epoxidation reaction as one of the pivotal steps. Compound 10 could be obtained from aldehyde 11 and sulfone 12 using Julia–Kocienski olefination as one of the
key steps.

Scheme 1 Retrosynthetic Analysis of Cytospolide Q (8)
Our synthetic endeavor commenced
with the preparation of aldehyde 11 (Scheme 2). Cheap and easily available
material, cinnamaldehyde (13), was subjected to Mg-mediated
Evans anti-aldol reaction4 using the known
oxazolidinone 14(3g,4) in the presence of trimethyl
silyl chloride (TMSCl)
and Et3N to obtain the corresponding TMS-protected aldol
adducts with very good selectivity, favoring the anti-aldol product
(dr > 19:1) which were subjected further for TMS deprotection using
trifluoro acetic acid (TFA). The crude mixture was purified by silica
gel column chromatography to obtain the known compound 15(4a) as a major isomer in 86% overall yield.
Next, the free hydroxy group of compound 15 was protected
as the corresponding TBS ether using tert-butyldimethylsilyl
triflate (TBSOTf)/2,6-lutidine and subsequently was saponified with
LiOH·H2O in the presence of H2O2 to afford acid 16 in 65% overall yield. Acid 16 was then treated with an ethereal solution of CH2N2 to obtain ester 17 in an excellent yield
(93%). The olefin functionality of ester 17 was finally
subjected to ozonolysis to get the required aldehyde 11.

The synthesis of the coupling partner (12) is delineated
in Scheme 3. Alcohol 18, prepared from l-arabinose following the literature
procedure,5 was treated with I2 in the presence of Ph3P/imidazole to access the corresponding
iodo compound. Next, the iodo compound was reacted with allyl magnesium
chloride in the presence of CuI and 1,3-dimethyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2(1H)-pyrimidinone (DMPU) to produce alkene 19 in good overall yield (67%).6 Alkene 19 was then ozonolyzed to obtain the corresponding aldehyde
which subsequently was reduced by NaBH4 to yield the known
alcohol 20.3g Alcohol 20 was subjected further to Mitsunobu reaction3b,7 in the presence of PTSH (21), di-isopropyl azo dicarboxylate
(DIAD), and Ph3P to access sulfide 22 which
finally was oxidized to sulfone 12 in 75% overall yield
using(NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O in the presence of 30% aqueous H2O2.3b,8

The completion of total synthesis of
cytospolide Q (8) is described in Scheme 4. Both the coupling partners 11 and 12 were subjected to crucial Julia–Kocienski
olefination3b,9 using KHMDS to get the coupled
products 10 and 10a as an inseparable mixture
(E/Z ≈ 4:1) in good yield.
The stereochemistry of the major product was assigned as an E-isomer
from the corresponding 1H NMR signals (3JH4–H5 = 15.3 Hz). Several attempts were
made to improve the E-selectivity of the required isomer by changing
the reaction conditions and the bases such as LiHMDS, NaHMDS, and
LDA. Unfortunately, none of them superseded the KHMDS result. Next,
the mixture of compounds 10 and 10a was
treated with tetra-n-butyl ammonium fluoride (TBAF)
to obtain compounds 23 and 23a in 87% yield
as an inseparable mixture. This mixture of compounds was then subjected
to kinetic asymmetric epoxidation, following the Sharpless protocol.10 The E-isomer underwent epoxidation in faster
rate relative to its Z-counterpart to produce the required epoxide 9 in a gratifying yield. Next, we planned for a set of cascade
reactions where the acid-catalyzed acetonide deprotection followed
by concomitant epoxide opening for cycloetherification followed by
γ-lactonization could be achieved in a single step.11 Thus, epoxide 9 was treated initially
with camphor sulfonic acid (CSA)/MeOH. The target compound (8) was obtained in 19% yield, whereas compound 24 was formed as a major side product in 49% yield. The spectroscopic
data (NMR and HRMS) and optical rotation (observed [α]D27 −1.5 (c 0.08, CHCl3); reported [α]D20 −4.4 (c 0.04, CHCl3)] of compound 8 were
in good agreement with the data reported1b for the isolated cytospolide Q which unambiguously confirmed its
total synthesis.

Scheme 4 Completion of the Total Synthesis of Cytospolide Q
(8)
Reagents and conditions: (a)
KHMDS, THF, 15 min, −78 °C, then 11, 1 h,
61%, based on recovered starting material 12, (E/Z >
4:1); (b) TBAF, THF, 0 °C to rt, 3 h, 87%; (c) Ti(OiPr)4, l-(+)-diisopropyl tartarate
(DIPT), tert-butyl hydrogen peroxide (TBHP), molecular
sieves (MSs) 4 Å, CH2Cl2, −20 °C,
6 days, 72% based on E-olefin used; (d) CSA, MeOH, rt, 5 h, 19% wrt
compound 8 and 49% wrt compound 24; (e)
2,2-DMP, CSA, 0 °C to rt, 3 h, 70%.

The
structure of compound 24 was elucidated through
2D-NMR studies. In order to confirm the stereochemistry as well as
to understand its formation, compound 24 was reacted
further with 2,2-dimethoxy propane (2,2-DMP) in the presence of CSA
to result the acetonide-protected compound 25. 13C NMR data of compound 25 showed a signal at δ
101.2 ppm establishing the anti-relationship between the C-3 and C-5
hydroxy centers.12 This also proved that
the methyl ester participated in epoxide opening preferably on γ-position
over the other possible δ-position to yield a γ-butyrolactone
moiety. This fact was supported further by the literature precedents
where carboxylic acid13 or ester14 or amide15 was reported
to undergo intramolecular epoxide opening to form γ-butyrolactone.
At this point, we planned to screen other reagents to test whether
the yield of the targeted molecule (8) could be increased
further by inhibiting the formation of γ-butyrolactone (24) with variation of acidity of the reaction medium. However,
trials with TFA or 80% AcOH–H2O or BF3·Et2O or Zn(NO3)2·6H2O gave almost similar results. It was further observed that
in the case of HF-py in THF, the ester carbonyl-assisted epoxide opening
took place even before any substantial deprotection of the acetonide
group.

All of the above observations led us to believe that
the ester
moiety at C-1 position facilitated the formation of unwanted side
product as a major compound in our case. Next, we planned to replace
the ester moiety of compounds 23 and 23a with benzyl ether. Thus, ester functionality of the mixture of compounds 23 and 23a was reduced by LiBH4 to
get an inseparable mixture of corresponding diols (Scheme 5). Our initial efforts to benzylate
the free primary alcohol moiety of the diols using BnBr in the presence
of different bases (NaHMDS, LiHMDS, and NaH) were not efficient because
of the formation of substantial amount of di-benzyl-protected compounds.
Finally, BnBr in the presence of Ag2O provided the monobenzylated
products 26 and 26a in 54% yield as an inseparable
mixture.16 The mixture of these compounds
was then subjected to Sharpless kinetic asymmetric epoxidation reaction
to get the required product 27 in good yield. However,
it was highly disappointing to see that compound 27 suffered
a similar fate like the epoxy ester (9) under acidic
conditions. When compound 27 was treated with CSA in
MeOH, the benzyl ether reacted promptly in preference to C-8 hydroxy
to form the unrequired THF compound 28 as a major product
(54%). The benzyl group was deprotected during the process. The required
product 29 was obtained in trace amount which could be
detected only by mass spectrometry.

Conclusions
In summary, we have
developed a convergent route for the total
synthesis of marine natural product cytospolide Q in 10 linear steps
from the known compound 18 with an overall yield of 2.8%.
This synthetic study also revealed that methyl ester and the benzyl
ether at C-1 position participated in epoxide opening reaction faster
compared to C-8 hydroxy to form the unrequired γ-butyrolactone-
and THF-containing compounds, respectively, as the major products.
We are of the opinion that the yield of the targeted molecule could
possibly be increased further by masking of C-1 position with an olefinic
moiety to prevent any kind of unwanted participation in epoxide opening.
This may need stepwise formation of required THF moiety followed by
functional group manipulations to install the lactone moiety. Efforts
are presently in progress in that direction which will be reported
in due course.

Experimental Section
General Experimental Procedures
Reactions, sensitive
to moisture, were carried out under argon atmosphere in a dried glassware
fitted with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar using anhydrous
solvents, unless otherwise noted. Liquids sensitive to air and moisture
were added into the reaction mixture via a gastight syringe fitted
with a stainless-steel needle or by cannula. The progress of a reaction
was monitored by a thin-layer chromatography (TLC, Silica gel 60 F254)
plate using UV light followed by charring the chromatography plate
using ethanolic solution of anisaldehyde (prepared with 1% AcOH and
3.3% concd H2SO4) as a developing agent. All
workup and purification processes were done with reagent-grade distilled
solvents, unless otherwise stated. Column chromatographic purifications
were executed using silica gel 60–120, 100–200, and
230–400 mesh. Yields mentioned based on chromatographically
and spectroscopically homogeneous materials, unless otherwise stated.
Optical rotation was recorded only for pure compound using a sodium
(589, D line) lamp which was represented as [α]D25 (c = mg/100 mL, solvent). The IR spectrum of the liquid sample was
measured using a thin film. A Quadruple-TOF micro-MS system using
an electrospray ionization (ESI) technique was used to collect HRMS
data. 1H NMR spectra were taken in 300, 400, and 500 MHz
spectrometers in appropriate solvents and calibrated using a residual
undeuterated solvent as an internal reference. The chemical shifts
have been represented in parts per million (ppm) scales. Multiplicities
of NMR signals have been reported as s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet),
q (quartet), br (broad), m (multiplet, for unresolved lines), and
so forth. 13C and 2D NMR spectra were measured on 75, 100,
and 125 MHz spectrometers.

(27)
To a suspension of activated 4 Å MSs
(powdered, 20 mg) in anhydrous CH2Cl2 (3 mL)
under argon at −20 °C, Ti(OiPr)4 (0.11 mL, 0.37 mmol) and (+)-DIPT (0.08 mL, 0.40
mmol) were added sequentially. After being stirred for 15 min at the
same temperature, the mixture of compounds 26 and 26a (115 mg, 0.34 mmol), dissolved in anhydrous CH2Cl2 (3 mL), was cannulated into the reaction mixture.
After 15 min, TBHP (4.0 M solution in toluene, 0.40 mL, 1.3 mmol)
was added and stirring was continued for 6 days at the same temperature.
The reaction mixture was quenched with a solution of tartaric acid
in water (100 mg in 1 mL), diluted with Et2O (10 mL), warmed
to the room temperature, and stirred further for 1 h. The organic
layer was separated, and the aqueous part was extracted Et2O (2 × 20 mL), washed with water and brine, and concentrated
in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in Et2O (5 mL) and
cooled to 0 °C, and a cooled 10% solution of NaOH in brine (2
mL) was added into it. The resultant mixture was stirred for 2 h at
room temperature to effect the hydrolysis of DIPT. The organic layer
was separated, and the aqueous part was extracted Et2O
(2 × 20 mL), washed with water and brine, dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. Purification
of crude residue by column chromatography (SiO2, 230–400
mesh, 12–20% EtOAc in hexane as an eluent) afforded epoxide 27 (63 mg, 70% based on E-olefin used) as
a colorless oil. 45 mg of a diastereomeric mixture (E/Z ≈ 1:1)
of compounds 26 and 26a was recovered: Rf = 0.33 (20% EtOAc/hexane); 1H NMR

The epoxy ester (27) (40 mg,
0.095
mmol) was dissolved in MeOH (3 mL), and CSA (2.3 mg, 0.001 mmol) was
added. The reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h. The reaction was
quenched with Et3N (0.5 mL). The resultant mixture was
concentrated under reduced pressure, and the resultant residue was
purified by column chromatography (SiO2, 100–200
mesh, 2–7% MeOH in CH2Cl2 as an eluent)
to afford compound 28 (15 mg, 54%) as liquid and trace
amount of compound 29 confirmed by HRMS only.
