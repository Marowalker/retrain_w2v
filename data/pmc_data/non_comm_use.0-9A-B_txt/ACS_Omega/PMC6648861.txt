rechargeable batteries. The Rietveld refinement of room-temperature
X-ray diffraction pattern shows the monoclinic phase with C2/m space group. The cyclic voltammetry

which are due to two-phase transition reaction between V5+/4+ and can be assigned to the single-step deintercalation/intercalation
of Na ion. We observe a good cycling stability with specific discharge
capacity (measured vs Na+/Na) between 80 (±2) and
30 (±2) mAh g–1 at current densities of 3 and
50 mA g–1, respectively. The electrochemical performance
of Na0.66V4O10 electrode was also
tested with Li anode, which showed higher capacity but decayed faster
than Na. Using density functional theory, we calculate the Na vacancy
formation energies: 3.37 eV in the bulk of the material and 2.52 eV
on the (100) surface, which underlines the importance of nanostructures.

==== Body
Introduction
After commercialization in the early 1990s,
rechargeable Li-ion
batteries (LIBs) are being widely investigated and used as energy
storage to power portable electronic devices and hybrid electric vehicles.1,2 This is mainly because LIBs show the lowest redox potential of the
Li (ELi/Li+ = −3.04
V vs standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)), which allows possessing high
voltage and energy density. Also, small ionic radius of Li+ (∼0.76 Å in six coordination state) allows its smooth
diffusion during charging/discharging, which makes long cycle life.3,4 However, due to huge demand, high cost, safety concerns, and limited
and nonuniform Li resources,5 Na-ion batteries
have generated considerable interest as a most promising alternative
(due to the uniform distribution and abundance of Na resources in
the earth crust) to the LIBs for large-scale energy storage systems.6−12 The elements Na and Li are from the same group in the periodic table
and have similar properties such as reactivity, physical strength,
etc. The global abundance, low cost, and appropriate redox potential
(ENa/Na+ = −2.71 V vs
SHE) prove its suitability as a good substitute for Li. However, large
ionic radius of Na-ion (∼1.02 Å in the six coordination
environment) compared to the Li leads to slow ionic diffusion and
lower energy density.13,14 Owing to these facts, materials
with open framework or materials that can exchange more than one Na
per formula unit or Na-rich materials are crucial for the possibility
of having high power and energy density.15,16

In this context, layered transition-metal oxides having formula
NaTO2 (T = transition metal) and polyanionic compounds
have been extensively explored and used as a cathode material for
Na-ion battery.17−24 For example, vanadium
oxychloride,25 Na0.44Mn1–xZnxO2,26,27 NaNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2,28 Na3V2(PO4)3,29 olivine-type phosphate- and sulfate-based cathodes like NaFePO4,30 NaFeSO4F,31 and even Prussian blue derivatives containing
a suitable transition metal such as KTFe(CN)632 act as an open-host framework with a large interstitial
space to absorb bigger Na+. However, due to their complex
reaction mechanism and to improve thermal stability, energy density,
and cycling performance, it is vital to search new cathode materials
and investigate their physical/electrochemical properties for Na-ion
batteries.33,34

Interestingly, in recent
years, vanadium-based oxide materials
have attracted worldwide attention as a possible alternate cathode
material for both Li-ion and Na-ion batteries.35−41 Because of the variable oxidation state of vanadium (+5 in V2O5 to +2 in VO), it acts as electron donor and
acceptor during the process of Na extraction and insertion.42 The crystal structure of β-NaxV2O5 bronze consists of three
different vanadium sites labeled as V(1), V(2), and V(3).43 The edge-sharing vanadium octahedra [V(1)O6]
and the corner-sharing vanadium octahedral [V(2)O6] combine to form
zigzag and double chains along the b axis, respectively.
The edge-sharing [V(3)O5] pyramid forms connection to the [V4O11] in layers, which are formed from the oxygen linkage
to the V(1) and V(2) octehedra, thus yielding a tunneled structure.43 Among the vanadium-based oxides, V2O5 has been studied extensively44−48 and the formed bronze tunneled structure is not only
more stable compared to the layered structures, but also provide fast
ion reaction kinetics. It has been reported that depending upon the
Li+/Na+ intercalation amount, V2O5 can yield high discharge capacity, i.e., 442 mAh g–1 for 3 Li+ per formula.49,50 Furthermore,
LixV2O5 (Li-bronze)
has been explored51−54 for Li-ion batteries, but it suffers significant capacity loss during
repetitive charging/discharging for an intercalated amount of x > 1.50 Analogous to LixV2O5 in Li ion, NaxV2O5 (Na bronze) was
also proposed for Na-ion battery, where the Na cations can be reversibly
cycled along the b axis in a similar manner to the
Li counterpart. Within pentoxide-based cathode, Na0.33V2O5 has gained significant attention as a cathode
material for Li-ion/Na-ion batteries because of high experimental
discharge capacity.43,55−57 Bach et. al.
first investigated the Na intercalation and deintercalation behavior
in Na0.33V2O5 bronze,55 and then similarly, NaV6O15 [(Na0.33V2O5)3] has
been studied as a cathode material in various morphologies such as
nanoplates, nanorods, nanoflowers, and nanoflakes for Li/Na-ion batteries
by various research groups.39,49,58,59 Jiang et al. synthesized NaV6O15 nanoplates and reported a discharge capacity
of 116 mAh g–1 measured vs Na+/Na with
a cycle retention of 55% at a current density of 50 mA g–1.58 However, note that the electrochemical
performance of Na0.33V2O5 critically
depends on the synthesis conditions, size in nanometer, and morphology.39,49,58,59 Therefore, nanostructures of Na0.66V4O10 [(Na0.33V2O5)2] in different morphologies still need to be explored in detail as
cathode material for Na-ion batteries. Also, it has been reported
that partial substitution of Li with Na in Li2–xNaxMnO3 improves
the electrochemical performance and significantly enhances the cycling
stability of Li-ion battery.60 This further
motivates to test our Na0.66V4O10 cathode with Li as counter electrode.

In this study, we synthesize
nanorods of Na0.66V4O10 and investigate
the electrochemical performance
for a promising cathode material in Na-ion batteries. The Rietveld
refinement of X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern reveals the monoclinic
phase with C2/m space group. The
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) studies reveal the rod-shaped morphology with agglomeration.
The size and length of the rods were found to be 50–100 nm
and a few micrometers, respectively. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves
of the prepared half-cells exhibit redox peaks at ≈3.1 and
2.6 V, which indicate phase transition reaction in V5+/4+ and can be assigned to the single-step deintercalation/intercalation
of Na ion. Interestingly, we observed good cycling stability with
specific discharge capacities of 80 (±2) and 30 (±2) mAh
g–1 at current densities of 3 and 50 mA g–1, respectively, measured vs Na+/Na anode. We have also
tested the electrochemical performance with Li anode. The energetics
of Na vacancy formation on discharging and Na vacancy filling on charging
could form a potential descriptor for electrochemical performance.
Since Na vacancy formation was relatively easier on the electrode
surface, a surface diffusion pathway for Na transport could be hypothesized.
For nanostructures, the available surface area for this pathway is
likely to increase, which further alludes to the measured electrochemical
performance.

Results and Discussion
Structural Analysis
To decide the annealing temperature
for stable phase formation, we performed the thermal analysis of the
resulting gel precursor under air atmosphere using thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) profile. Figure 1 shows the variation in mass (%) of the gel precursor with
increase in temperature. The mass loss of around 10% below 180 °C
(region 1) is due to the removal of physically adsorbed as well as
some intercalated water molecules.61 The
steep mass loss (Δm = 46.3%) observed between
180 and 400 °C in region 2 is attributed to the removal of acetate
precursors and volatile impurities in the form of NH3 and
CO2 gases. Vigorous oxidation and decomposition reactions
take place in this region, leading to the phase formation of NVO material.
Further, negligible mass loss was observed in regions 3 and 4, i.e.,
above 400 °C in TGA profile. It can be observed from the TGA
profile that annealing at about 400 °C would be sufficient for
the phase formation of Na0.66V4O10 (NVO) material. We have also tried annealing at higher temperatures
and found good thermal stability of the prepared material.

analysis (TGA) of the precursors used to synthesize
Na0.66V4O10 samples.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern along with
the corresponding
Rietveld refinement of the prepared Na0.66V4O10 (NVO) sample is shown in Figure 2a. The XRD pattern was matched with the standard
phase using X’Pert HighScore Plus software with PDF2 reference
data file. The obtained XRD pattern of the synthesized NVO powder
could be well indexed with the pure phase of the pristine sodium vanadium
bronze, i.e., β-Na0.33V2O5 having
monoclinic structure with C2/m space
group (JCPDS code: 48-0382), as also reported in ref (62). The sharp and intense
peaks reveal the crystalline nature of the sample. The Rietveld refinement
was performed to obtain the quantitative crystal structure information
such as lattice parameters. The peaks were modeled using the pseudo-Voigt
function, and the full width at half-maximum was refined using Lorentzian
broadening of the XRD peaks. The structural refinement results (χ2 = 2.3, Rp = 4.6%, Rwp = 6.3%) indicate that the fitting is reliable and good.
The obtained lattice parameters from refinement are: a = 15.425 Å, b = 3.610 Å, c = 10.073 Å, and β = 109.54°, which are in good agreement
with previous reports of Na0.33V2O5.63 Further, we have provided the fractional
coordinates and site occupancies in Table 1.

lattice is equivalent to 1 (1/nm).

We further characterize the prepared NVO cathode material
to check
the morphological properties. The SEM image reveals the formation
of uniformly distributed highly agglomerated rod-shaped morphology,
as shown in Figure 2b. However, the length of the rods varies dramatically, which gives
rise to some platelike particles over rod-shaped morphology. The TEM
images in Figure 2c,d
clearly confirm the formation of nanosized rod-shaped morphology of
the NVO sample, in agreement with the SEM analysis. The dark and slightly
grayish regions correspond to the NVO nanorods, which display uniform
dimensions with width 50–100 nm and length several micrometers.
The cathode materials in the nanosized particles/rod shape are expected
to enhance the electrochemical performance of Na-ion batteries. Note
that the characteristic diffusion length (L) of nanostructures
and the diffusion coefficient (D) of Na ion are related
as: τ = L2/D, where
τ is the time for Na ion to diffuse through the electrode material.
In this context, one can achieve better electrochemical performance
by decreasing L, which effectively reduces τ.
The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern for the synthesized
NVO sample is shown in Figure 2e, which reveals the existence of sharp diffraction spots
along with diffused circles that represents the polycrystllaine nature
of the synthesized sample. The interplanar spacing/distance (d = 0.47 nm) calculated using the SAED pattern matches to
the (200) peak of the XRD pattern.

Electrochemical Performance
Now we present, in Figure 3a–d, the electrochemical
performance of the prepared NVO cathode in terms of cyclic voltammetry,
galvanostatic charge/discharge curves, rate performance, and Coulombic
efficiency. Figure 3a shows the cyclic voltammograms (CV) of prepared NVO electrode in
the potential range of 1.5–4.0 V at a scan rate of 0.05 mV
s–1, measured v/s Na+/Na at room temperature.
Interestingly, it exhibits redox peaks at around 3.1 and 2.6 V, which
are due to two-phase transition reactions between V5+/4+ and can be assigned to the single-step deintercalation/intercalation
of Na ion in the Na0.66V4O10 electrode.
It is interesting to note that no such characteristics have been observed
in vanadium-based oxide cathodes. Liu et al. reported the charge/discharge
profile of NaV6O15 [(Na0.33V2O5)3] that has multiple steps/plateaus.39 The obtained CV results are consistent with
the charge/discharge profiles, as shown in Figure 3c. The insertion and extraction behavior
of Na ion can be tentatively given as 1  Figure 3c shows the galvanostastic first charge/discharge
curves of
prepared CR2016 half-cells using NVO as cathode and recorded at various
current densities from 3 to 50 mA g–1 in the potential
range of 1.5–4.0 V vs Na+/Na. The specific discharge
capacities of the NVO sample are observed to be 80 (±2), 64 (±2),
56 (±2), 52 (±2), and 30 (±2) mAh g–1 at current densities of 3, 5, 11, 20, and 50 mA g–1, respectively. Assuming no electrolyte decomposition during the
first charge, Na0.66V4O10 charged
to Na0.09V4O10 (corresponding to
the charge capacity of 80 mAh g–1 at 3 mA g–1) and then back to Na0.66V4O10. Note that the discharge capacity of about 80 mAh g–1 (1C equated to 141 mAh g–1) corresponds
to +4.86 oxidation state of vanadium, consistent with the CV results.
It can also be seen from Figure 3c that as the current density increases from 3 to 50
mA g–1, the specific discharge capacity decreases
from 80 (±2) to 30 (±2) mAh g–1 with an
apparent drop in potential plateau, which is due to the increase in
polarization and resistance or iR drop of the electrode
at high current densities. Note that the OCV for NVO cathode was observed
to be around 2.8 V. The GCD results in Figure 3c show the charge/discharge voltage plateau
around 2.9/2.8 V, respectively, at 3 mA g–1 vs Na/Na+. The relatively high overpotential indicates that the activation
energy of the redox event is very high because of which the potential
necessary to transfer an electron from NVO cathode is relatively high
even at low current density. The comparison of the 1st, 2nd, and 10th
cycle discharge capacity curves are shown in Figure 3d. The discharge capacity remains fairly
constant for 10 cycles, which elaborates the structural stability
of the electrode material. The cycling stability and rate performance
for an electrode are very important parameters to determine the stability
in long-term applications. Figure 3e,f shows the stepwise electrochemical rate and cycling
performance, respectively. As observed from Figure 3e, the capacity decreases with increase in
current density and goes to minimum for 50 mA g–1. Figure 3f shows
the cycling performance of the synthesized NVO sample at 5 mA g–1 current density at room temperature. It shows an
initial discharge capacity of 64 (±2) mAh g–1 and retains nearly 100% capacity even after 50 charge/discharge
cycles. The Coulombic efficiency of the NVO electrode for 50 charge/discharge
cycles at 5 mA g–1 current density is also shown
in Figure 3f. The Coulombic
efficiency for all of the charge/discharge cycles is observed to be
more than 95% (Figure 3f).

anode: (a) cyclic voltammetry (CV) at a scan rate of 0.05 mV s–1 vs Na+/Na at room temperature. (b) Electrochemical
impedance spectra of the as-prepared NVO sample at an alternating

curves at 5 mA g–1 current density. (e) Rate performance
at different current densities. (f) Cycling performance and Coulombic
efficiency for 50 cycles measured at 5 mA g–1.

Furthermore, the electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of
fresh cells was performed to measure the electrode/electrolyte resistance. Figure 3b shows the impedance
spectra of NVO sample measured with an AC voltage pulse having an
amplitude of 5 mV. The EIS curve, measured in the frequency range
of 10 mHz to 100 kHz, shows a depressed semicircle and a straight
line in the high- and low-frequency regions, respectively. In general,
the ohmic resistance (Rs) of the cell,
i.e., the resistance due to electrolyte and electrode material, can
be estimated by an intercept at the Z′-axis
in the high-frequency region. The information about the electrochemical
reactions taking place at the electrode/electrolyte interface, which
indicates the charge transfer resistance (Rct), can be obtained from the semicircle in the mid-frequency range.
Also, the Warburg impedance (Zw), which
is associated with Na-ion diffusion in the electrode active material,
can be represented by the inclined line in the low-frequency region.
The cell parameters were obtained to be Rs = 594 Ω and Rct = 778 Ω.

The chemical diffusion coefficient of the Na ions inside an electrode
material is calculated using the following equation 2  where D, T, R, n, A, C, and F are diffusion coefficient (cm2 s–1), absolute temperature (K), gas constant
(8.314 J mol–1 K–1), number of
electrons involved in the redox process, electrode area (2.2 cm2), Na-ion concentration (3.139 × 10–3 mol cm–3), and the Faraday constant (96 486
C mol–1), respectively, and σw is
the Warburg impedance coefficient, which is related to Z′ by the following equation 3  In the inset
of Figure 3b, we show
the obtained value of σw from the slope of Z′ and ω–0.5, which was found
to be 7739 Ω s–0.5. The value of n (=59 mV/ΔV) can be calculated by taking the
difference between oxidation and
reduction peaks (ΔV = 0.53 V) in CV (see Figure 3a), which was found
to be 0.1 (number of electrons participating in charging and discharging
processes). Finally, by using these values in eq 2, the obtained value of the diffusion coefficient
is 1.239 × 10–13 cm2 s–1, which is in good agreement with the one reported in ref (64).

It is important
to compare the observed capacity in this manuscript
with the other related cathode materials reported in the literature.65−67 For example, Liu et al. observed a discharge capacity of about 100
mAh g–1 at 0.1C current rate in Na3V2(PO4)3/C nanofibers cathode materials.65 Zhang et al. found a reversible capacity of
about 120 mAh g–1 for NaVO3 cathode after
the activation at high voltage.66 More
recently, Shinde et al. have used the ultrasonic sonochemical synthesis
method to prepare Na0.44MnO2 cathode, which
shows a reversible capacity of about 110 mAh g–1 at a current rate of C/10 with good cycling stability.67 By changing the preparation method to self-combustion,
the NaV6O15 nanoplates show a capacity of about
150 mAh g–1 at a current rate of 20 mA g–1, which remains about 82 mAh g–1 after 30 cycles.58 On the other hand, NaV6O15 nanorods prepared by PVP-modulated synthesis route shows a high
initial capacity of about 157 mAh g–1 at 20 mA g–1 current density.41 Also,
Lee et al. compared discharge capacity and rate characteristics of
α-V2O5 and β-Na0.33V2O5 single-crystalline nanowires in Na-ion batteries
and found better performance in the latter case.40 The enhanced electrochemical performance was reported by
Ali et al. by Na intercalation into the nanosized V2O5/C composite.46 Wang et al. synthesized
nanoarrays of orthorhombic V2O5, which provides
many advantages like shorter paths for Na+ diffusion, more
direct path for electron transport, and enhanced surface area of electrode.47 The V2O5 polymorphs were
reported as better material for Na insertion with large capacity (120–200
mAh g–1 at C/10 rate) and good cycle rate.48 Moretti et al. used V2O5 aerogel as anode material for Na-ion batteries and studied its low-voltage
behavior, which shows about 200 mAh g–1 capacity
and good efficiency.68 Very recently, carbon-coated
NaO6O15 nanotubes have been reported as cathode
with better Na-storage capacity.69 Here,
it should be noted that the discharge capacity of NVO cathode crucially
depends on the preparation method, amount of Na content in the material,
and morphology of the nanoparticles49 as
well as type of intercalation Li+/Na+.

To test the feasibility of prepared Na0.66V4O10 (NVO) as a cathode material for Li-ion batteries,
we assembled the half-cells vs Li/Li+ as an anode and performed
the electrochemical measurements with two electrolytes, i.e., 1 M
NaClO4 and LiPF6 (ethylene carbonate/dimethyl
carbonate (EC/DMC) 1:1 V/V) to find which one is better suited for
this purpose. These cells are abbreviated as NVON (for NaClO4) and NVOL (for LiPF6), respectively. The cyclic voltammograms
of the prepared NVO vs Li/Li+ cells are shown in Figure 4a for both the electrolytes.
The data were recorded at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s–1. Both the half-cells show well-defined oxidation/reduction peaks
(Figure 4a). However,
the intensity of redox peaks in the NVOL half-cell is higher than
that of NVON redox peaks, which could be attributed to the better
Na-ion diffusion. The redox pairs observed at 3.5/2.7, 3.8/3.1 V (for
NVOL) and 3.5/2.7, 3.9/2.8 V (for NVON) can be due to intercalation
of Li ions in the host NVO structure (Figure 4a). The EIS results of both the half-cells
are presented in Figure 4b, where it can be observed that NVOL half-cell possesses lower charge
transfer resistance compared to the NVON half-cell, which is well
consistent with the CV results. The charge resistance was found to
be around 800 and 1300 Ω for the NVOL and NVON half-cells, respectively
(Figure 4b). The CV
and EIS results indicate that NVOL half-cell would display better
electrochemical properties compared to the NVON half-cell.

voltammetry and (b) EIS results of the NVO half-cell

electrolyte vs Li/Li+. Initial charge/discharge comparison

NVON half-cells at different current densities. (h) Cycling performance
of the half-cells at a current density of 5 mA g–1 for 50 charge/discharge cycles and (i) Columbic efficiency of the
half-cells.

Figure 4c,d shows
the initial charge/discharge curves for both the half-cells (NVOL
and NVON) and the results are in well agreement with CV and EIS results.
One slopping voltage plateau around 3.5 V and other flat plateau around
2.7 V can be clearly seen. However, as the current density increases
from 3 to 11 mAh g–1, the voltage plateaus shift
to the lower side due to an increase in the polarization and cell
resistance. The specific discharge capacities were found to be around
101, 87, and 69 mAh g–1 at current densities of
3, 5, and 11 mA g–1, respectively, for NVOL half-cell.
On the other hand, for NVON half-cell, the obtained values are around
97, 83, and 55 mAh g–1 at current densities of 3,
5, and 11 mA g–1, respectively. The intercalation
and deintercalation of the Na ion in the host structure can be understood
in the following reaction: during the first discharge process, Li
ion moves in to the host NVO electrode 4  During the charging
cycle, Na+ ions
together with Li+ ions will be removed from the host structure 5  Thus, the obtained
Na(0.66–y)V4O10 will again combine with
Li ion during discharge 6  Therefore, during repeated
charging/discharging, both the Na and Li ions will contribute to the
electrochemical performance of the battery.

In Figure 4e,f,
we show the charging/discharging comparison of the 1st, 2nd, and 10th
cycles for both the half-cells recorded at the current density of
11 mA g–1. The NVOL half-cell displays a large capacity
fading over consecutive cycles compared to the NVON cell. The specific
discharge capacity of NVOL half-cell decrease from 69 to 20 mAh g–1 (72% decrease), while in NVON half-cell, the decrease
is 31% (from 53 to 38 mAh g–1) in the 10th cycle. Figure 4g,h shows the rate
and cycling performance of the two half-cells vs Li/Li+, which show comparable capacities up to 5 mA g–1, and for 11 mA g–1, the capacity in NVOL cells
decays faster compared to NVON cells (see Figure 4g). The specific discharge capacity decays
76% for NVOL, while for NVON half-cell, the capacity decays 64% when
the current density changes from 3 to 11 mA g–1.
Now we show in Figure 4h the cycling performance measured at the current density of 5 mA
g–1 up to 50 charge/discharge cycles. Both the cells
show a gradual decrease in the discharge capacity as capacity decreases
from 106 to 69 mAh g–1 for the NVOL and from 83
to 57 mAh g–1 for the NVON half-cell. The Columbic
efficiency for both the half-cells is measured at 5 mA g–1 current density (Figure 4i). For both the half-cells, we observed 100% Coulombic efficiency
for all of the cycles except the first one for NVOL, which is unexpectedly
higher 176%. The possible explanation for such a high value in the
first cycle is that during the discharge, there is an extra charge
(or electrons) because of the presence of Li in the host structure
in the alloy form (LixNa0.66V4O10). This extra charge contributes to the
capacity during the discharge, while during charging, only Na0.66V4O10 remains (see eqs 4 and 5) and
therefore, the charge capacity is lower, which reflects in the calculation
of the Coulombic efficiency.

Density Functional Theory
Density
functional theory
(DFT) is used to calculate the charging and discharging energies of
NVO structures with different Na contents. The optimized NVO crystal
structures with different Na contents are shown in Figure 5 (top). Here, the structures
of Na1.0V4O10, Na0.66V4O10, Na0.33V4O10, and V4O10 were obtained by sequential removal
of Na atoms, whereas the structure of Na1.66V4O10 was obtained by adding one Na atom to Na1.33V4O10. The sequential removal of Na atom from
Na1.0V4O10 to Na0.66V4O10 was done keeping in mind the highest separation
of Na vacancy. The other structures obtained by sequential removal
of Na atoms are unique as the Na atoms are equivalent. Charging represents
the energy gain by the addition of Na, whereas discharging represents
the energy required to remove a Na ion. Thus, charging and discharging
processes can be defined as 7   8  As the number of Na atoms in NaxV4O10 decreases from 1.33 to
0.33, a gradual increase in both the energy gain during charging and
the energy required for discharging is observed. Na1.33V4O10 has the lowest Na vacancy formation energy
(EvNa = 2.84 eV), but the energy gain during the charging is low
(EfNa = −1.48 eV). Hence, Na1.33V4O10 cannot be a good candidate for the battery operation,
whereas Na0.33V4O10 shows a very
high energy storage capability due to its high energy gain during
the Na addition (EfNa = −3.37 eV), but it also has a very
high Na vacancy formation energy (EvNa = 3.71 eV) and hence, also not
a good candidate for battery application. The Na0.66V4O10 samples have the moderate values for both the
energy gain in Na addition (EfNa = −3.01 eV) and the energy
required for creating Na vacancy (EvNa = 3.37 eV; see Figure 5a for calculations performed
without considering U for vanadium). These two characteristics
directly point toward the potential of Na0.66V4O10 as a good battery candidate. However, the energy required
for creating Na vacancy at the bulk of Na0.66V4O10 is still very high (EvNa = 3.37 eV; Table 2) and will be difficult
at the normal battery operating conditions.

for vanadium.

Addition of Na at the Different Surfaces

(010)	0.039	3.36	–2.74	
(110)	0.046	3.01	–2.47	
To check the effect of U,
the Na vacancy formation
energy and Na filling energies were recalculated with Ueff = 3.3 eV applied for vanadium70 (see Figure 5b).
We observed a similar trend on the Na vacancy formation energy and
filling energy of the NaxV4O10 sample with Ueff = 3.3
eV for vanadium.

The nanostructured morphologies of the cathode
materials are in
general known to show better electrochemical activities,71−73 as also shown in our experimental results. It is understood that
the nanostructuring opens up the surface diffusion channels, where
the formation of the Na vacancy and the diffusion of Na are known
to be easy compared to the bulk. To understand the nanostructuring
phenomenon for our target NVO material Na0.66V4O10, we studied the surface Na vacancy formation energy
and Na filling energies at three different surfaces of NVO, (100),
(010), and (110), as shown in Figure 6. The DFT calculated energies for Na vacancy formation
and Na filling are listed in Table 2, for all of the three surfaces. The surface energy
calculation shows that the (100) surface is more stable than the (010)
and (110) surface, and hence will cover most of the exposed surface
of the nanoscale material. The Na vacancy formation energy is calculated
to be the lowest for the (100) surface (EvNa = 2.52 eV), which
is lower by 0.85 eV compared to the bulk (EvNa = 3.37 eV). The
(010) surface has a similar Na vacancy formation energy to the bulk,
whereas on the (110) surface, it is a little lower (EvNa = 3.01
eV). The lower values of Na vacancy formation energy at the (100)
surface will enhance the concentration of Na vacancy at the surface,
which will result in a higher diffusion and hence better electrochemical
performance.

Position of extra Na atom during the Na filling (green circle) for
different surfaces, with energies indicated at the bottom. The distances
between the Na atoms in (a) and (b) are given in angstrom unit.

The Na filling energy also follows
the same trends as the Na vacancy
formation energy. The energy gain due to the addition of Na at the
(100) surface is calculated to be the lowest (EfNa = −2.19
eV), whereas the energies are also lower for (010) and (110) surfaces
(EfNa = −2.74 and −2.47 eV, respectively) compared
to the bulk (EfNa = −3.01 eV), as given in Table 2. Furthermore, for
the calculations of Na vacancy formation energy and Na filling energy,
we have tested different possible configurations, and the most stable
configuration was used to calculate the Na vacancy formation energy
and Na filling energy. The two Na atoms present at the (100) surface
are equivalent; hence, unique geometry was obtained for Na vacancy
formation energy at the (100) surface. For the Na atom filling energy
at the (100) surface, two configurations were studied, as shown in Figure 6a,b (bottom) along
with the filling energy. For the (010) surface, there is only one
Na atom present at the surface; hence, the geometry obtained for Na
vacancy formation energy at the (010) surface is unique. Similar to
the (100) surface, two different configurations were obtained for
the Na atom filling energy. On the other hand, the two Na atoms present
at the (110) surface are equivalent; hence, only one unique geometry
was obtained for Na vacancy formation energy. Also, two different
configurations were obtained for the Na atom filling energy at the
(110) surface (see Figure 6e,f).

Conclusions
In summary, the rod-shaped
Na0.66V4O10 (NVO) nanostructured
cathode material was prepared using
the sol–gel method. The XRD patterns confirm the formation
of pure monoclinic phase with the C2/m space group, and no impurity or secondary phases were observed.
The SEM and TEM studies reveal the rod-shaped agglomerated morphology
of the prepared cathode material with width 50–100 nm and the
length a few micrometers. The observed selected area electron diffraction
pattern is in good agreement with the XRD pattern. The cyclic voltammetry
(CV) results showed the two-phase transition reaction between V5+/4+, which is in good agreement with the galvanostatic charge/discharge
curves. The electrochemical performance indicates that the NVO cathode
exhibits specific discharge capacities of 80 (±2), 64 (±2),
56 (±2), 52 (±2), and 30 (±2) mAh g–1, measured vs Na+/Na at the current densities of 3, 5,
11, 20, and 50 mA g–1, respectively. The electrochemical
performance of Na0.66V4O10 electrode
with Li anode is found promising, but decays faster compared to the
Na anode. The energetics of Na vacancy formation and filling on discharging
and charging, respectively, could form a potential descriptor of the
electrochemical performance. The available surface area for Na transport
is likely to increase for nanostructures, which further supports the
experimental results.

Materials and Methods
Experimental Details
The nanostructured Na0.66V4O10 (NVO) samples were synthesized by sol–gel
route using sodium acetate (C2H3NaO2) and ammonium metavanadate (H4NO3V) in 1–6.06
molar ratio, from Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99.0%. The starting precursors
were homogeneously mixed in deionized water with continuous stirring.
Citric acid (anhydrous, C6H8O7, from
Fisher Scientific, 99.5%) was used as a chelating agent in a molar
ratio of 1:1 with metal ions. The resulting mixture of citric acid
and precursors was heated at 80 °C with continuous stirring at
400 rpm until a homogeneous gel was obtained. Then, the gel was dried
overnight at 120 °C to obtain the powder, followed by heat-treating
in a muffle furnace in air at 400 °C (with 5 °C/min rate)
for 5 h. The final powder was stored in a vacuum desiccator for physical
and electrochemical characterizations. The thermal decomposition of
the resulting gel precursors was examined by thermogravimetric analysis
(NETZSCH, TG 209 F3 Tarsus) at a ramp rate of 10 °C/min in air
from room temperature to 900 °C.

The crystallographic structure
and phase purity of the prepared samples were determined by room-temperature
powder X-ray diffraction (from Panalytical) with Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 1.540 Å) operating at 40 kV voltage and 40 mA current.
The XRD pattern was recorded in 2θ angular range between 10
and 70° with a step size of 0.02°. The XRD data have been
analyzed by Rietveld refinement using FullProf package, and the background
was fitted using linear interpolation between the data points. We
study the morphology of the prepared cathode using a Zeiss EVO 50
scanning electron microscope working at 20 kV in scattered electron
mode. A JEOL JEM-1400 Plus microscope coupled with energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) facility has been used for the transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) measurements at 120 keV.

For the electrochemical
measurements, cathodes were prepared by
mixing prepared active material poly(vinylidene difluoride) as a binder
and super P (conductive carbon) in a weight ratio of 80:15:5 in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NM2P) as a solvent. Then, we stirred
the resulting mixture for 5 h to achieve homogeneous mixing and then
coated over Al foil (as a current collector) using the doctor blade
technique. The coated Al sheet was then dried overnight in a vacuum
oven at 80 °C to evaporate the solvent. The sheet was then roll-pressed
and punched into a circular electrode with 12 mm diameter. The active
mass loading on the electrodes was between 2 and 3 mg. Before bringing
inside the glovebox workstation, we dried the electrodes in vacuum
at 60 °C to remove any moisture. Na chips (16 mm diameter) were
extracted from Na cubes (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9%) by cutting, rolling,
and pressing sodium cubes into thin sheets inside the glovebox and
used as both counter and reference electrodes. For electrochemical
measurements, the CR2016 coin half-cells were assembled in an argon-filled
glovebox (Jacomex, ≤0.5 ppm of O2 and H2O levels) with the cathode electrode, Na metal, and a glass fiber
(Advantec, GB-100R) as the separator. The electrolyte used was 1 M
NaClO4 dissolved in ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate
(DMC) in a volume ratio of 1:1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) using an AC voltage pulse of 5 mV in the frequency range of
100 kHz to 10 mHz was also performed to measure the electrode resistance.
We have also assembled and tested the half-cells vs Li+/Li as an anode to study the feasibility of the prepared NVO cathode
as a material for Li-ion batteries. The assembled cells were tested
with both electrolytes like 1 M NaClO4 and LiPF6 (EC/DMC 1:1 v/v) and abbreviated as NVON (for NaClO4)
and NVOL (for LiPF6). All of the electrochemical measurements
were carried out at room temperature using VMP3 (Bio-Logic) instrument.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed in the potential window of 1.5–4.0
V vs Na/Na+ at a scan rate of 0.05 mV s–1. The charging/discharging characteristics were studied in galvanostatic
mode at different current densities.

Computational Method
Periodic plane-wave-based density
functional module implemented in Vienna Ab Initio simulation package74 is applied to calculate the energy of the cathode
material with six different NaxV4O10 compositions, where x = 1.66, 1.33,
1, 0.66, 0.33, and 0. The model structure of Na1.33V4O10 [Na2V6O15]
composition was obtained from ÒThe Materials ProjectÓ
database https://materialsproject.org/ (materials ID. mp-778594),70 having monoclinic
crystal structure with C2/m space
group. The lattice parameters a = 15.7845 Å, b = 3.6662 Å, c = 10.6182 Å,
and α = 90° and β = 103.093° match well with
the experimentally obtained cell parameters. The sodium bulk metal
geometry is modeled as cubic body-centered cubic bulk with lattice
parameters a = 4.2906 Å and α = 90°.
Geometry optimization is performed on the structures, with energy
and force convergence criteria set to 1 × 10–4 eV and 0.05 eV/Å, respectively. RPBE75 GGA exchange correlation functional and ultrasoft pseudopotentials
(USSP)76 are used. Plane-wave basis sets
are expanded to an energy cutoff value of 396 eV. Monkhorst–Pack77k-points grid of 1 × 3
× 1 is utilized for all of the calculations on different NVO
structures, whereas a 5 × 5 × 5 grid is used for Na bulk
lattice geometry optimization. The Na vacancy formation energy (EvNa) of NVO structure NaxV4O10 is calculated using the following formula 9  where E(NaxV4O10), E(Na(x–1)V4O10), and E(Na) are the
energies of NVO structure NaxV4O10, Na(x–1)V4O10 formed after Na removal, and energy of
bulk Na, respectively. Similarly, the energy gain from Na addition
(EfNa) to NVO structure NaxV4O10 can be calculated as 10  To study
the nanostructuring effect on the
Na vacancy formation and Na filling energies, three different low-index
surfaces, (100), (010), and (110), are created for the NVO structure
studied experimentally, Na0.66V4O10. A 2 × 1 supercell was used for (100) surface, whereas for
both the (010) and (110) surfaces, a 1 × 1 unit cell is used
for the surface calculation. For all of the three surfaces, a four-layer
surface slab is used, where two bottom layers are kept fixed to their
bulk positions and the top two layers are allowed to relax. A vacuum
of 20 Å is used to model the surface slabs. Calculations of Na
vacancy formation energy and Na filling energy are performed by removing
and adding Na at the corresponding surface, respectively. For the
addition of Na to the surface, two distinct adsorption sites were
studied and the geometry and energy of the most stable adsorption
site were reported. Equations 9 and 10 are used to calculate the surface
Na vacancy formation energy and Na filling energy, respectively.
