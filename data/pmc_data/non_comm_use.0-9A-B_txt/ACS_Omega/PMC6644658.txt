==== Body
Introduction
Dibenzofurans can be
found in a wide range of natural products;
they are used as pharmaceutical candidates1 because of their unique properties, such as anticancer, antibacterial,
antiallergy, antimalarial, and anti-inflammatory activities (Scheme 1).2 In addition, fused dibenzofuran skeletons are considered
to be potential photoelectronic materials in blue phosphorescent organic
light-emitting diodes.3 As a result, many
research groups devoted themselves to developing new approaches to
construct dibenzofuran motifs,4 which can
be divided into intermolecular and intramolecular categories: (A)
intramolecular synthesis strategy: cyclization of diaryl ether derivatives,5 formation of C–O bonds using biaryls;6 (B) reaction of ortho-iodophenols
with silylaryl triflates in the presence of CsF to afford the O-arylated
products, which are subsequently cyclized using a Pd catalyst to dibenzofurans;7 reaction between 6-diazo-2-cyclohexenone and
an ortho-haloiodobenzene through tandem Pd-catalyzed
cross-coupling/aromatization followed by a Cu-catalyzed Ullmann coupling
reaction.8 However, these strategies suffer
from hash reaction conditions, tedious steps, limited substrate scope,
and use of molar excess of catalyst.

Scheme 1 Selected Active 3-(2-Oxopropyl)-2-arylisoindolinone
and the Synthetic
Strategies
Recently, cyclic diaryliodoniums
have emerged as a new paradigm
to synthesis of dibenzothiophenes,9 dibenzopyrroles,10 and dibenzoselenophens,11 which avoids poor atom economy by generating 1 equiv of an iodoarene
as waste. Considering our continuous interest in developing application
of hypervalent iodine reagent in organic synthesis, we were focused
mainly on construction of heterocyclic to exploit diverse diaryliodonium
salt transformations.12 Accordingly, intramolecular
cyclizations of dibenziodolium triflates were established by our group
for the synthesis of dibenzothiophenes13 and fluorenones.14

Results and Discussion
Inspired by the pioneering achievements, we postulated that the
dibenzofurans can be prepared via double C–O bond formation.
However, C–O bond formation has received much less attention,
partly owing to the large energy gap between M–O HOMO and M–C
LUMO frontier orbitals.15 From former investigation
and proposal, diaryliodonium salts could be activated by Cu(I) species
through oxidative addition.16 On the basis
of the above work, we initiated our study by investigating the reaction
of cyclic diaryliodonium 1a, a protocol based on CuI;
K2CO3 in a mixture solvent (toluene/H2O = 9:1) at 100 °C for 4 h provided the desired compound 2a in 13% yield (Table 1, entry 1). Encouraged by this promising result, catalysts
were first investigated. Although various copper catalysts were tested,
such as CuCl, CuBr, Cu(OAc)2, Cu(OTf)2, Cu2O, and Cu(MeCN)4PF6, the yield could
not be increased. Generally, the ligand backbone has a critical impact
on the reactivity and selectivity of transition-metal catalytic reaction;
therefore, ligand examination was carried out. Gratifyingly, the yield
was remarkably improved when ligands were used; the reaction with L4 as ligand provided dibenzofuran 2a in 83%
yield (Table 1, entry
11). Ligand screening indicated that generally monodentate ligand
PPh3 was not efficient and the bidentate nitrogen ligands
were found well adapted to this reaction, such as L2, L3, L4, and L5. Next, the impact
of base on the reaction was studied (entries 14–18); other
inorganic bases, such as Cs2CO3, t-BuOK, NaOH, Na2CO3, led to lower yields; improved yield was not observed
when organic base Et3N was employed. A remarkable solvent
effect was then observed during solvent investigation. To our delight,
the product yield could be further improved to 92% in MeOH, whereas
no reaction occurred in 1,4-dioxane and dimethylformamide (DMF). H2O as the source of oxygen is essential for this reaction;
we proceed the reaction in pure water in the presence of 5 mol % CuI,
10 mol % of L4, and 2 equiv of K2CO3 at 100 °C to yield the desired product 2a in only
28% yield at 4 h. However, the results were significantly improved
when the reaction time prolonged to 12 and 24 h, as 2a was obtained in up to 96% yield.

On the day of
submission, we learned Huang and Wen’s group
demonstrated a similar idea on the preparation of dibenzofurans.17 Having established the optimal conditions for
the dibenzofuran synthesis, we intended to determine its scope and
limitation. A series of reactions of cyclic diaryliodonium salts 1 and H2O were carried out under the standard conditions.
All reactions of cyclic diaryliodonium salts 1 bearing
varied R1 and R2 groups proceeded smoothly to
afford the corresponding dibenzofuran 2 in good to excellent
yields (Table 2). The
transformation was sensitive to the electronic nature of the diaryliodonium
salt substituent; generally, reactions of substrates containing electron-donating
substituents in 2 position led to higher yields than the reactions
of those bearing electron-withdrawing groups (2b–d vs 2e, 2f). The yields were found
to be a little lower for the substrates bearing halogen groups at
the meta position on the cyclic diaryliodonium salts (2g–i); however, the C4-substituted halogen salts
were more favorable than those at meta position (2j, 2k vs 2g, 2h). Subsequently, the
C2-substituted groups were also investigated (2l), and
the yield was influenced slightly unfavorably by steric effects. Notably,
disubstituted diaryliodonium in different positions could be applied
in this methodology and afforded the desired products in modest-to-good
yields (2n–p). Likewise, disubstitution
on different aromatic rings was also tested in the reaction and relatively
normal yields were obtained (2q–s). In addition, when fused cyclic diaryliodonium salts were employed,
desired polycyclic products were detected in modest-to-good yields.

b Isolated yield.

Prompted by these results, we sought
to design an efficient synthetic
route to various ladder-type heteroacenes18 that contain furan rings in the fused-ring framework. Benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]bisbenzofuran,19 an organic semiconducting material molecule,
exhibiting an outstanding electron ability with both high charge carrier
mobility and high stability, could be obtained in 72% yield from the
double diaryliodonium salts 1v through the oxygen–iodine
exchange reaction. Interestingly, when cyclic diaryliodonium salts 1w that contain thiophene rings were treated under the standard
conditions, corresponding sulfone product 2w could be
afforded in 50% yield, which might be a promising candidate for organic
field-effect transistor materials
(Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Syntheses
of Ladder-Type Heteroacenes
Next, we decided to elucidate the reaction mechanism of
the formation
of dibenzofuran, from the reaction we know wherein the key was the
source of oxygen atoms. Accordingly, some control experiments were
designed under the standard conditions as shown in Figure 1. Treatment of cyclic diaryliodonium 1a with 5 mol % CuI and 10 mol % L4 in dry MeOH
at 100 °C failed to deliver possible dibenzofuran 2a, suggesting that oxygen atoms might not be derived from air. To
further explore the source of oxygen atoms, the isotope labeled water
H218O was employed in the reaction and 18O labeled product 2a′ was isolated in
81% yield. These results indicated that the oxygen atom was derived
from H2O.

Figure 1 Control experiments.

On the basis of the control experiment results and relevant
literature,
we proposed the mechanism of this cyclization reaction. A reasonable
mechanism suggested that an oxygen–iodine exchange process
is involved, as shown in Figure 2. Initially, the oxidative addition of cyclic diaryliodonium
salts 1 with CuI and ligand L afforded intermediate A, containing intramolecular iodobenzene. Subsequently, ligand
exchange of A with H2O formed hydroiodic acid
and complex B. Next, reductive elimination of intermediate B took place to get 2-[2′-iodophenyl]phenol C and Cu(I) intermediate; ligand L was released out simultaneously.
Then, oxidative addition of 2-[2′-iodophenyl]phenol C to Cu(I) would provide a new electrophilic Cu(III) intermediate,
which can be attacked by hydroxyl under basic conditions to form intermediate D. Finally, reductive elimination of D gave the
desired product 2 and regenerated the catalyst.

mechanism.

Conclusions
In summary, a Cu-catalyzed
cyclization of cyclic diaryliodonium
salts in water has been developed via double C–O bond formation.
The developed oxygen–iodine exchange methodology provides straightforward
access to dibenzofuran derivatives in up to 96% yield. Applying this
strategy, a concise synthesis of organic semiconducting material molecule
has been accomplished in moderate yields. Further studies to explore
the diaryliodonium salts are currently underway in our laboratory.

Experimental
Section
General Information
All of the reactions was carried
out under an air atmosphere condition. Various reagents were purchased
from Aldrich, Acros, or Alfa. For column chromatography, 200–300
mesh silica gel was used. 1H, 13C and 19F NMR were recorded on Bruker 400 or 500 MHz spectrometer in CDCl3. High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was performed on
an Agilent 6540 Q-TOF mass spectrometer (ESI). Melting points were
determined on a SGW X-4B melting point apparatus. Cyclic diaryliodoniums
are prepared according to the literature.8

General Procedure for Preparation of Compound 2
In the pressure tube, a solution of diaryliodonium salts 1 (0.1 mmol), K2CO3 (0.2 mmol), CuI
(0.05 mmol), and ligand L4 (0.1 equiv) in H2O (2.0 mL) was stirred at 100 °C for 24 h. After completion
of the reaction (observed on thin-layer chromatography), the solvent
was evaporated under reduced pressure to obtain the crude mixture.
The residues were purified by silica-gel column chromatography (ethyl
acetate/petroleum ether = 1/50:1/10) to afford the pure product 2. The obtained product was analyzed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and 19F NMR.
