In past years, the presence of toxic
heavy metal ions in water
and soil has caused major health problems. The ternary type semiconductor
material, reduced graphene oxide (rGO)–Sm2MoO6–TiO2, has been investigated as a photocatalyst
for the reduction of soluble chromium(VI) into (III) for the first
time. The as-synthesized rGO–Sm2MoO6–TiO2 catalyst was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy, X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy, FT-Raman, Fourier transform infrared,
and optical spectroscopy. The maximum Cr(VI) reduction of 96% was
achieved within 70 min under visible light illumination. The powder
XRD analysis confirmed the formation of anatase TiO2. Field-emission
SEM images depicted well-dispersed rGO sheets, and TiO2 and Sm2MoO6 particles are randomly distributed
onto rGO. The reduction of Cr(VI) by rGO–Sm2MoO6–TiO2 was considerably greater than the
reduction by Sm2MoO6, TiO2, Sm2MoO6–rGO, TiO2–rGO, and
Sm2MoO6–TiO2. Sm2MoO6 acts as an effective cocatalyst to TiO2 to enhance the separation of photo-generated electron–holes.
Even after six consecutive cycles, the photoreduction of Cr(VI) was
more than 85%, which reveals that the excellent reusability performance
of the catalyst for practical applications. The photogenerated electron
plays an important role in the reduction of Cr(VI) into nontoxic Cr(III),
and the synergistic effect of rGO greatly improved the separation
of h+ and e– pairs.

1 Introduction
Heavy metals in the aquatic
system have adverse effects on the
environment because of their high toxicity. Chromium has two general
oxidation levels under relevant natural conditions: Cr(III) and Cr(VI).
Chromium(III) is less mobile, less toxic, and easily precipitated
as hydroxides, and Cr(III) is found in many vegetables, fruits, meats,
grains, and yeast.1−4 Cr(VI) is highly active, dangerous, and toxic and present in the
wastewater of chrome plating, electroplating, timber treatment, chilling
plants, steel and alloy industries, leather tanning, automobiles,
and mining industries. The release of Cr(VI) into the water sources
can induce cancer, dermatitis, chronic ulcer, gastrointestinal tract
damage, and kidney and lung damage.5−7 As a toxic environmental
pollutant that induces harmful effects on human beings, the International
Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has identified Cr(VI) as a type
I carcinogen. Hence, the United States Environmental Protection Agency
(USEPA) has optimized the limit on the amount of chromium in the drinking
water to less than 0.1 mg L–1.8 Because of the harmful nature of Cr(VI), the need for its
reduction to Cr(III) from the waste is highly desired. The reduction
of chromium(VI) into chromium(III) using chemicals such as sodium
bisulfate, sodium thiosulfate, and ferrous sulfate is expensive.9 Recent strategies for the reduction of Cr(VI)
into Cr(III) focus on different methods like chemical reduction, biological
reduction, electroreduction, and photocatalytic reduction. In general,
chemical routes have maximum reduction rates compared to the other
mentioned methods.10−13

In particular, semiconductor-based metal oxides such as TiO2, ZnO, and WO3 have received considerable attention
under UV or visible light illumination. Among these semiconducting
metal oxides, TiO2 is an excellent material with low cost,
high stability, and hypotonicity.14−16 Bare TiO2 has been used for Cr(VI) reduction.17 Suppression of the photogenerated hole–electron recombination
in a semiconductor is needed to improve the efficiency as a photocatalyst.
A small amount of foreign atoms added in the regular crystal lattice
of the semiconductor oxide material makes dramatic changes in their
electronic properties by increasing their electron or hole densities.18−21 Photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) with modified ZnO and TiO2 was investigated by several authors.22−24 Rare-earth
materials have received extensive attention because of their catalytic,
luminescent, magnetic, optoelectronics, and chemical properties, which
originate from the 4f shell of rare-earth ions. The metal molybdate
of rare-earth materials forms an important category of nanomaterials
that leads significant interest as composite oxides due to its potential
application in diverse fields. Sm2MoO6 was reported
to be an effective cocatalyst to enhance the separation of photogenerated
electron–holes and the efficiency of electron transfer.25 Samarium doping can efficiently improve the
photocatalytic reduction rate of TiO2, as a modified semiconducting
metal oxide photocatalyst.26−28 Reduced graphene oxide (rGO)
has a hexagonal honeycomb lattice structure made up of carbon atoms
with sp2 hybridization and has excellent electrical, optical,
and mechanical properties and thermal stability. rGO is an ideal platform
for various composites because of its uniform planar structure and
excellent electron transport properties. Combining rGO with TiO2 causes defects in the bandgap of TiO2 and expands
its sensitivity range to improve the photocatalytic activity.29−32 In this study, we report ternary type semiconductor material rGO–Sm2MoO6–TiO2 for photocatalytic
reduction of hexavalent chromium.

2 Experimental
Section
2.1 Materials and Methods
Ti(OCH2CH2CH2CH3)4, Sm(NO3)3·6H2O, Na2MoO4·2H2O, Graphite flakes, H2SO4, KMnO4, H2O2, and HCl were
obtained from Merck chemicals.

2.2 Synthesis
of rGO–Sm2MoO6–TiO2
Graphene oxide (GO) was prepared
from graphite by Hummer’s method.33 Natural graphite powder (2.0 g) was added to 180 mL of H2SO4 with 1.5 g of NaNO3, and the mixture was
stirred at 10 °C for 2 h. Then, 6.0 g of KMnO4 was
added, and the reaction mixture was stirred continuously for 24 h
at 10 °C. The solution mixture was transferred into a 200 mL
ice reaction container with 10 mL of H2O2. Then,
the solid GO mixture is rinsed with deionized water, 30 wt % of HCl,
ethanol, and diethyl ether. The final product was dried to 60 °C
for 12 h to get GO. To 0.05 M of Sm(NO3)3·6H2O in 70 mL of deionized water, 0.05 M of Na2MoO4·2H2O solution was mixed under stirring for
2 h. The pH value was fixed to 10 using NaOH solution for the formation
of Sm2MoO6.34 The
Sm2MoO6 suspension was added with 11.84 mL of
titanium(IV) butoxide in 100 mL of ethanol and stirred for 3 h. GO
and oxalic acid (100 mg) were added to the above suspension, and the
whole mixture was kept in an autoclave at 150 °C for 10 h. Then,
the final product was annealed at 450 °C to obtain rGO–Sm2MoO6–TiO2.

2.3 Photocatalytic Measurement
2 milligrams
of Cr(VI), obtained from K2Cr2O7,
was mixed in 100 mL of deionized water with 50 mg of prepared photocatalyst.
The solution pH values were fixed as 3, 5, 7, and 9 using dilute H2SO4 and NaOH. The solution was stirred for 30 min
without a light source to reach adsorption–desorption equilibrium
between the catalyst and Cr(VI). During irradiation, 5–6 mL
of solution for every 10 min was collected and centrifuged. The concentration
of Cr(VI) was recorded by its absorbance at 350 nm using a UV–visible
spectrometer.35

2.4 Analytical
Method
The X-ray diffraction
(XRD) pattern was obtained by a XRD 700 model. Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) images were recorded with a JEM-Z300FSC model. Field
emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) recorded by a JEM-ARM300F
instrument. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded
by a Nicolet (Madison, USA), and UV vis spectra were recorded using
a UV 1280 instrument.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Optical Studies
Diffuse reflectance
spectra of Sm2MoO6, Sm2MoO6–TiO2, and rGO–Sm2MoO6–TiO2 in the transmittance mode(Figure 1a) reveal the absorption edges
with a steep absorption at 320, 376, and 420 nm. The bandgap energies
of Sm2MoO6, Sm2MoO6–TiO2, and rGO–Sm2MoO6–TiO2 were calculated from [F(R)hν]1/3 using Kubelka–Munk
function,36 and they are 3.91, 3.12, and
2.94 eV, respectively (Figure 1b).  

Figure 1 (a) DRS–UV spectra

vs band gap energy (eV) of Sm2MoO6–TiO2, Sm2MoO6, and rGO–Sm2MoO6–TiO2.

The decreased bandgap energy of rGO–Sm2MoO6–TiO2 may enhance the visible light activity
of the material. The bandgap energy of Sm2MoO6–TiO2 is reduced by the addition of rGO.

3.2 Crystal Structure Analysis
The XRD
analysis was carried out to find the crystal structure and phase purities
of TiO2, rGO, Sm2MoO6, Sm2MoO6–TiO2, and rGO–Sm2MoO6–TiO2 composites (Figure 2). All diffraction peaks of
pure TiO2 are consistent with the anatase TiO2, which well-coincided with JCPDS card no. 89-4203. The XRD peaks
at 25.34, 37.70, 47.94, 54.61, and 62.58 correspond to the planes
(101), (004), (200), (211), and (204) anatase phase of titania with
a monoclinic structure. The powder diffraction peak positions at 28.28,
30.88, 33.65, 46.48, 48.27, 53.63, and 57.37 represent (321), (231),
(240), (721), (602), (361), and (921) planes of Sm2MoO6 with a monoclinic structure which is in good agreement with
JCPDS file no. 70-1729. The rGO peak at 23.92 corresponds to (002)
plane; the rGO peaks were not observed in the XRD spectra of rGO–Sm2MoO6–TiO2 as these characteristic
peaks of rGO located at 23.92 might have merged with the characteristic
peak of TiO2.37,38

rGO, TiO2, Sm2MoO6, Sm2MoO6–TiO2, and
rGO–Sm2MoO6–TiO2.

3.3 Morphology Analysis of
rGO–Sm2MoO6–TiO2
The FE-SEM images
of the as-prepared rGO–Sm2MoO6–TiO2 composite are depicted in Figure 3. Well-dispersed rGO sheets can be easily
distinguished from Figure 3a,b. The morphology of TiO2 particles is spherical
in shape, and randomly distributed TiO2 and Sm2MoO6 nanoparticles as depicted in Figure 3c,d. From Figures 3b–d, it can be observed that the TiO2 particle and Sm2MoO6 nanoparticles
are grafted nicely onto the rGO, achieved through the bonding among
Sm2MoO6, TiO2, and rGO during the
hydrothermal process. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) was performed
to know the presence of Sm, Mo, Ti, O, and C in this composite material.
The elemental mapping results confirmed the presence of samarium (Sm),
molybdenum (Mo), titanium (Ti), oxygen (O), and carbon (C) in the
catalyst (Figure 4).
The morphological structures of the prepared catalyst were analyzed
using TEM images, as depicted in Figure 5. Figure 5a,b at different magnifications confirms that the rGO–Sm2MoO6–TiO2 catalyst constitutes
of a large amount of TiO2 and Sm2MoO6 particles on the rGO sheet. The high resolution TEM image of the
rGO–Sm2MoO6–TiO2 composite
at higher magnification depicted in Figure 5c,d shows fringe spacing of 0.35 nm for anatase
TiO2 (101) and 0.28 nm for Sm2MoO6 (321), which are consistent with XRD analysis results.

3.4 FT-IR
Spectral Analysis
FT-IR spectra
for TiO2, Sm2MoO6–TiO2, and rGO–Sm2MoO6–TiO2 are presented in Figure 6. The low-frequency broad absorption 535, 589, and
601 cm–1 can be associated with the vibration of
Ti–O–C and Ti–O–Ti bonds, assigned to
Ti–O–C in the catalyst. The broad peaks at 3436 and
1620 cm–1 correspond to the hydroxyl group.39 The presence of less absorption peaks around
1630 cm–1 are ascribed to the −OH bending
mode.40 The vibration peak observed between
600 and 500 cm–1 is ascribed to Mo–O characteristics
stretching vibration, and small intense peaks between 1000 and 900
cm–1 are ascribed to Mo=O stretching vibration,
respectively.41

Sm2MoO6–TiO2, rGO–Sm2MoO6–TiO2, and TiO2.

3.5 FT-Raman
Figure 7 depicts
two major characteristic bands at
1345 and 1585 cm–1. The D band peak at 1345 cm–1 is ascribed to the breathing mode of k-point phonons, and the G band position at 1585 cm–1 is ascribed to the sp2 hybridization. The D band ratio
can be measured as the disorder degree and restoration of the sp2 carbon bonded structure of GO. The intensity ratio values
of the D and G bands can reflect the size of sp2 carbon
bonded structural disorder of rGO sheets. After the reduction, the ID/IG ratio increases
compared with the GO. The ID/IG ratio values for GO and rGO can be found out, and they
are 0.862 and 1.142, respectively. The ID/IG of rGO is 1.142, which is higher
than that of GO, suggesting an increase in the smaller rGO upon reduction
of GO.42,43

3.6 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
Spectra of
rGO–Sm2MoO6–TiO2
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was recorded to know the
chemical composition of the catalyst, which is shown in Figure 8. The survey spectrum of rGO–Sm2MoO6–TiO2 indicated that elements
such as Sm, Mo, Ti, O, and C are present in the catalyst (Figure 8a). The Ti 2p core-level
photoelectron spectrum depicted that the binding energy peaks 458.8
and 464.6 eV correspond to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2, respectively (Figure 8b), which agree with the binding energy value of the pure anatase
Ti4+ state.44 In Sm2MoO6, the typical peaks 1083.6 and 1110 eV correspond
to Sm 3d5/2 and Sm 3d3/2 and are attributed
to Sm3+(Figure 8c). The binding energy peaks at 233.1 and 236.2 eV are assigned
to Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2, respectively, depicting
a six valence oxidation state for Mo+6 in the composite
material (Figure 8d).25,45,46 The Gaussian peaks at 531.6 and
532.8 eV were ascribed to the lattice oxygen, oxygen vacancy, and
O–H bonds, as shown in Figure 8e. The XPS spectral analysis of carbon C 1s was split
into three Gaussian peaks 284.8, 286.2, and 288.8 eV and was indexed
to C–C, C–O–C, and C–O, respectively (Figure 8f).47,48

(f).

3.7 Photocatalytic
Reduction of Cr(VI) into Cr(III)
Photocatalytic chromium(VI)
reduction was performed with Sm2MoO6, Sm2MoO6–rGO,
TiO2, TiO2–rGO, and rGO–Sm2MoO6–TiO2 catalysts, and reduction
curves are displayed in Figure 9. The initial test depicted that no reduction was observed
without light, resulting that the reduction was mainly due to the
photocatalyst. A slight decrease in chromium(VI) concentration around
12% is due to adsorption in the blank condition after 70 min. With
prepared catalyst rGO–Sm2MoO6–TiO2, the reduction of Cr(VI) was almost complete in 70 min under
visible light illumination. The composite material rGO–Sm2MoO6–TiO2 catalyst was more efficient
than other catalysts Sm2MoO6, Sm2MoO6–rGO, TiO2, and TiO2–rGO.
Percentages of chromium Cr(VI) reductions are 41, 57, 72, 81, and
96 under visible light illumination in 70 min for catalysts Sm2MoO6, Sm2MoO6–rGO,
TiO2, TiO2–rGO, and rGO–Sm2MoO6–TiO2, respectively, as shown
in Figure 9a. To analyze
the effect of dosage of rGO–Sm2MoO6–TiO2 in Cr(VI) reduction, various weight ratios such as 30, 40,
50 and 60 mg of catalyst were added and photocatalytic reduction was
investigated under identical experimental conditions. The photoreduction
performances of different weight ratios of rGO–Sm2MoO6–TiO2 are 60, 75, 96, and 92%, corresponding
to weight ratios 30, 40, 50, and 60 mg, respectively. The increase
of the catalyst amount increases the reduction of Cr(IV) due to the
increased adsorption by the catalyst particle and increased density
in the area of illumination.49 Under these
experimental conditions, 50 mg/100 mL of catalyst is found to be an
optimum dosage for effective reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) under
visible light illumination in 70 min. Cr(VI) reduction rate increases
up to 50 mg/100 mL, and a further increase of the catalyst amount
decreases the reduction rate. At 60 mg/100 mL concentration (above
50 mg/100 mL), scattering of light by catalyst particles decreases
the reduction rate.50Figure 9c,d shows the kinetic curves
of photoreduction of Cr(VI) with different catalysts and dosage of
rGO–Sm2MoO6–TiO2. The
pseudo-first-order rate constant values for Sm2MoO6, Sm2MoO6–rGO, TiO2, TiO2–rGO, and rGO–Sm2MoO6–TiO2 are 0.0112, 0.0185, 0.0259, 0.0371,
and 0.0716 min–1, respectively. The rate constant
values of 0.0135, 0.01974, 0.04717, and 0.03406 min–1 correspond to 30, 40, 50, and 60 mg weights of the catalyst, respectively.
The maximum rate constants are 0.0716 min–1 for
the composite material and 0.04717 min–1 for 50
mg of catalyst, which indicates optimum conditions for maximum chromium
reduction under visible light irradiation. From Figure 9e, the decrease in intensity of the absorption
band with respect to time of visible light illumination in the presence
of the rGO–Sm2MoO6–TiO2 catalyst is observed. The UV absorption peak at 350 nm for K2Cr2O7 decreases over time due to the
reduction of Cr(VI).51 The influence of
various Cr(VI) concentrations was performed at 10 to 40 mg/L of Cr(VI)
to find the optimum condition with the catalyst used. The concentration
change with respect to the illumination time is shown in Figure 10a. The Cr(VI) reduction
is decreasing from 95 to 59% by increasing its initial concentration
from 10 to 40 mg/L. With the increase of Cr(VI) concentration up to
40 mg/L, the photoreduction is gradually decreased due to the reason
that the amount of the catalyst is the same and the difficulty of
light entry to the catalyst surface (Figure 10a).52 The photocatalytic
reduction of Cr(VI) by rGO–Sm2MoO6–TiO2 was performed at various pH values from 3, 5, 7, and 9 with
the initial Cr(VI) concentration of 10 mg/L, and reduction percentages
are shown in Figure 10b. After 70 min visible light illumination, the Cr(VI) reduction
percentages are 93.8, 88, 63.3, and 47.8% corresponding to pH values
3, 5, 7, and 9, respectively. The best performance pH level is 3 and
5 for the reduction of Cr(VI). As reported earlier, acidic pH condition
is favorable for the electrostatic attraction between the catalyst
and chromate ion which increases the reduction of Cr(VI).17,53 The rate constant values for different concentrations of Cr(VI)
with the rGO–Sm2MoO6–TiO2 catalyst were calculated from kinetic curves displayed in Figure 10c,d. The pseudo-first-order
rate constants 0.0391, 0.0263, 0.0181, and 0.0129 min–1 correspond 10, 20, 30, and 40 mg/L of Cr(VI), and at pH values 3,
5, 7, and 9, pseudo-first-order rates constant are 0.0373, 0.0288,
0.0134, and 0.0078 min–1, respectively. The highest
rate constant values of 0.0391 and 0.0373 min–1 for
maximum reduction were observed at 10 mg/L of Cr(VI) and at pH 3.

3.8 Reusability and Recovery
Experiment
The reusability efficiency of rGO–Sm2MoO6–TiO2 was investigated by
recycling the recovered
catalyst, and the results are shown in Figure 11. The reduction percentages for the first
two cycles are 88 and 86%, respectively. The efficiency of the catalyst
is decreased to 84, 83, 81, and 80% for the third, fourth, fifth,
and sixth cycles, respectively. The reduction percentage up to sixth
use of the catalyst was not changed much. The slight variation in
the photoreduction performance in the recycling experiment may be
due to the adsorption of the Cr(VI) solution on the surface of the
catalyst. Figure 12 depicts the effect of scavengers used to identify the main reactive
species involved in the reduction process. Isopropyl alcohol, AgNO3, and triethanolamine were used as scavengers for •OH, e–, and h+, respectively. Cr(VI)
reduction with rGO-Sm2MoO6–TiO2 is highly suppressed by AgNO3 (32.1%), which shows the
main role of e– in the reduction process. Band gap energy of
TiO2 is decreased to 2.94, by the presence of Sm2MoO6, making the catalyst visible-active. When the rGO–Sm2MoO6–TiO2 composite material
is exposed to visible light, the electron in TiO2 are excited
from the valence band to conduction band and the Sm2MoO6 as a cocatalyst, effectively separates electron and hole
preventing their recombination.25 Reduced
GO sheets was reported to serve as electron collectors and sources
of adsorption sites generating the reactive centers of the photoreduction.54 In addition, rGO resists the recombination of
electrons and hole pairs effectively because of its excellent electrical
conductivity.55 Hence, the presence of
rGO increases in photocatalytic activity synergistically. Further,
the h+ reacts with H2O to form hydroxyl radicals
and then H2O2 to induce Cr(VI) reduction with
the help of H+.56 Based on these
observations, a mechanism for photoreduction of Cr(VI) is proposed
in Scheme 1.

4 Conclusions
Ternary semiconductor photocatalyst
rGO–Sm2MoO6–TiO2 was
prepared by the hydrothermal method
and characterized by a suitable analytical method. The FT-Raman spectral
analysis confirmed the reduction of GO into rGO sheets. FE-SEM images
depicted that TiO2 and Sm2MoO6 particles
are randomly distributed onto a well-dispersed rGO sheet. The powder
XRD pattern confirmed the formation of anatase TiO2 with
(101) plane. The maximum Cr(VI) reduction of 96% was achieved in 70
min visible light illumination with rGO–Sm2MoO6–TiO2 indicating its higher reduction efficiency
than other catalysts. Even at the sixth cycle, the prepared photocatalyst
has 80% efficiency for the reduction of Cr(VI) under visible light.
The photogenerated electron plays an important role for the reduction
of Cr(VI) into nontoxic Cr(III), and holes are captured by water forming
hydroxide radicals and then hydrogen peroxide, leading to the separation
of h+ and e– pairs. Sm2MoO6 acts as an effective cocatalyst to enhance the separation
of photogenerated electron–holes and rGO as an electron collector
increases the photocatalytic activity synergistically.
