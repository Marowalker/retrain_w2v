A selective adsorption/desorption
of organoiodine compounds was
achieved on poly(2-methoxyethyl acrylate)-analogue microspheres, wherein
the side chains in the polymers act as halogen-bonding sites. These
results demonstrate that the halogen-bonding sites in the side chains
exhibit adequate specific affinity for organoiodine compounds. In
addition, the water-swollen pMEA-analogue microspheres (microgels)
showed a thermoresponsive swelling/deswelling behavior that permitted
a controlled release of the organoiodine compounds upon changing the
temperature. Thus, it seems plausible that a variety of problems associated
with, e.g., the recovery of rare iodine-containing compounds, such
as the marine-derived iodine compounds, the delivery of iodine-containing
drugs, or the removal of halogen compounds from wastewater, could
be resolved by polymer microspheres that exhibit controlled halogen
bonding.

Introduction
Organoiodine compounds
play an important role in everyday life.
For example, functional iodine compounds have found applications as
antibacterial and antiviral drugs, X-ray absorbers, and as components
for food and cosmetics.1−7 Especially, marine-derived organoiodine compounds are highly valuable,
and they have received much attention due to their biological activity,
which includes inhibitory activity against cancer and diabetes.8−10 However, the variety and abundance of marine iodine compounds are
much lower than those of the corresponding chlorine and bromine analogues.9 Moreover, organic syntheses of new iodine-containing
drugs produce in many instances the corresponding iodine-free compounds
in addition to the targeted organoiodines.1 Thus, the selective recovery and reuse of the target iodine compounds
as starting materials, catalysts, and synthesized products in aqueous
solution should be highly desirable, irrespective of the concentration
of these compounds in solution. On the other hand, the presence of
mass-produced organoiodine compounds in industrial wastewater or natural
water resources are of particular concern for safe drinking water,
as organoiodine compounds can be toxic, mutagenic, or carcinogenic,
and their removal from drinking water is highly important.11

However, to the best of our knowledge,
suitable materials for a
selective separation of such iodine compounds have not yet been designed.
Thus far, the removal of halogen-containing compounds from aqueous
solution has been achieved predominantly using metallic materials,
such as layered double hydroxides (LDHs).12−14 However, these
LDHs usually require a reduction upon releasing the adsorbed halide
anions,14 which increases the number of
reaction steps.

Against this background, we focused on the use
of polymer microspheres,
as these have large specific surface areas and high mobility and exhibit
a particular ease of recovery and handling.15−19 We found that polymer microspheres selectively adsorb
and release halogen compounds.20,21 These microspheres
consist of hydrophobic poly(2-methoxyethyl acrylate) (pMEA) and a
poly(oligo(ethylene glycol) methacrylate) hydrogel matrix, i.e., they
represent polymer/polymer composite hydrogel microspheres (microgels).
These microgels benefit from not only the aforementioned microsphere
features but also the intrinsic features of the hydrogel network,
which allows halogen compounds to enter the inside of the microgels
via diffusion and to exit the microgels upon applying external stimuli.22−34 In such microgels, the methoxy groups of the pMEA side chains are
crucial for the halogen bonding, which occurs via noncovalent interactions
and results in anomalously short intermolecular distances.35−39 Consequently, halogen bonding in composite microgels leads to a
strong adsorption of halogen compounds in the presence of other compounds
under concomitant formation of strong atomic interactions and high
selectivity.21

However, for low concentrations
of several compound mixture, where
iodine-, bromine- chloride-, and halogen-free compounds coexist in
water, the iodine-free compounds are usually also absorbed by the
composite microgels, indicating that the selectivity of the adsorption
of iodine-containing compounds is still low. The very strong interactions
between pMEA and halogen-containing compounds thus occur irrespective
of the nature of the halogen atom, which stands in contrast to the
behavior of halogen atoms with Lewis acids, wherein the strength of
the donor–acceptor interaction depends on the polarizability
of the halogen atom, which decreases in the order I > Br > Cl.35−39

A strategy that allows the highly selective adsorption of
iodine-containing
compounds at low cost and independent of time and place would be highly
attractive for industrial (e.g., water treatment and iodine-recycling
systems) and medical applications (drug development). With this objective
in mind, we changed the number and position of oxygen atoms, which
are the Lewis-basic acceptors for the halogen bonds, in the polymer
chain to control the strength of halogen bonding between the microspheres
and the iodine-containing compounds. The induced dipole moment of
oligo(ethylene glycol) depends on its molecular weight, and the polarizability
of the polymer chain can thus be changed by the number of carbon–oxygen
bonds.40−42 The strength of halogen bonding relating to the polarizability
should accordingly decrease with increasing number of carbon–oxygen
bonds in the polymer side chain. Therefore, we hypothesized that pMEA
analogues, which have more than two methoxy or ethoxy groups in their
side chains, should be able to interact specifically with the iodine
compounds due to the decreased polarity. In this study, we synthesized
the first pMEA-analogue microspheres by free-radical polymerization
in water and subsequently examined their separation potential with
respect to iodine-containing compounds.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
and Characterization of the Tested Microspheres
The tested
microspheres and the conditions for their synthesis
are listed in Table 1. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images and the chemical structures
of the tested microspheres are shown in Figure 1. The average size distributions of these
microspheres are also shown in Figure S1. In this study, the initiator potassium persulfate (KPS), which
leads to negatively charged surfaces, was used to start the polymerizations,
as the effects of electrostatic attractions between the microspheres
and the anionic halogen compounds can be neglected. The electrophoretic
mobility (EPM) of the tested microspheres was negative (Table 1). Nonfunctionalized pMEA and
pMEA-analogue microspheres were prepared by soap-free precipitation
polymerization, whereby the monomers were dissolved in water during
the polymerization, and the resulting polymers precipitated in water
to form the microspheres. To compare the adsorption behavior of the
halogen-containing compounds, polystyrene (pSt), poly(butyl acrylate)
(pBA), and poly(4-methoxystyrene) (pMSt) were selected as solid control
microspheres. As the methoxy groups in the pMSt microspheres act as
electron-donating groups due to the resonance effect,43 the difference of the dielectric polarization between the
pMEA (analogues) and pMSt microspheres can be discussed.

a Microspheres
were dispersed in sodium
phosphate buffer (pH = 7) at 25 °C.

b The cross-linker ethylene glycol
dimethacrylate (EGDMA, 5 mol %) was added to the polymerizations.

As poly(2-(2-ethoxyethoxy)
ethyl acrylate) (pET2A) chains have
a relatively low critical solution temperature (LCST; ∼15 °C),44−46 the solid pET2A microspheres did no disintegrate at room temperature
in the absence of a cross-linker. We note that at temperatures below
15 °C, hydrodynamic diameter (Dh)
of pET2A microspheres decreased (Figure S2a), suggesting that the disintegration of pET2A microspheres occurred
due to the hydration of pET2A chains. Conversely, poly(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)
ethyl acrylate) (pME2A) and poly(2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy) ethoxy]ethyl
acrylate) (pME3A) microspheres were not obtained in the absence of
a cross-linker during the polymerizations, due to their relatively
high LCST values (pME2A: ∼43 °C; pME3A: ∼63 °C).44−46 Thus, the cross-linker ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) was
added to the polymerizations (5 mol %), which afforded stable pME2A
and pME3A microgels (Table 1 and Figure 1). These microgels are thermoresponsive, as their Dh decreased with increasing temperature (Figure S2b,c). The difference between the solid and hydrogel
states of these microspheres also influenced the adsorption behavior
of low-molecular-weight compounds (vide infra).

Adsorption
Behavior of Halogen Dyes in pMEA-Analogue Microspheres
To
examine the origin of the halogen-bonding, anionic halogen-containing
xanthene dyes, such as eosin Y (EoY), erythrosine (Ery), phloxine
B (PhB), and rose bengal (RB), were selected as organohalogen model
compounds (Figure S3). Especially, iodine-containing
Ery and RB are often used in food and cosmetics.1 To compare the halogen bonding with other, e.g., hydrophobic
interactions, other anionic dyes that do not contain halogen atoms,
such as orange II (OrII) and tartrazine (Ttz), were also examined. Figure 2 shows the adsorption
isotherm for each dye for the tested microspheres at 25 °C. Langmuir
(eq 1) and Freundlich
(eq 3) models were applied
to analyze the adsorption equilibrium data. These isotherms are shown
in Figure S4. In all cases, the correlation
coefficient (R2) of the Langmuir model
was close to 1 and much larger than that of the Freundlich model,
indicating a good fit of the Langmuir model. Table 2 shows the values of the Langmuir isotherm
parameters, and all values are summarized in Table S1. Here, the adsorption capacity (Qm) values determined by the Langmuir model were normalized as moles
of dye per total surface area (Nm/s, μmol/m2) or volume (Nm/v, μmol/m3) of tested microsphere to compare the adsorption behavior
under consideration of the different size and state (e.g., solid or
gel) of these microspheres and the different molecular weight of each
dye. Furthermore, the essential characteristics of the Langmuir isotherm
can be described by a separation factor (RL) relating to the Langmuir constant (b), which is
defined by eq 2 (Tables 2 and S1). The value of RL indicates the shape of the Langmuir isotherm and the nature of the
adsorption process: irreversible (RL =
0), favorable (0 < RL < 1), linear
(RL = 1), or unfavorable (RL > 1).47

d Nm/s could not be determined, as it is
difficult to determine the surface
area of the microgels.

Initially,
we would like to discuss the significance of the polarization
of the polymer side chains, which contribute to the halogen bonding.
In contrast to pMEA, the methoxy group in pMSt acts as an electron-donating
group, i.e., Lewis acid, due to resonance effect.43 The adsorbed amounts of halogen-containing dyes on the
pMSt microspheres were much lower than those on the pMEA microspheres,
and close to those on the pSt and pBA microspheres (Figure 2 and Table 2). In addition, the pMSt paste was not stained
with, e.g., the red appearance of Ery or EoY after centrifugation,
although facile staining of the pMEA paste was observed (Figure 3), which indicates
that the inductive effect due to the permanent dipole of the methoxy
groups in pMEA should be an important factor for halogen bonding.
As reported,21 the hydrophobic interactions
between the tested solid microspheres and the dyes should lead to
an adsorption of the tested dyes on the pMSt, pSt, and pBA control
microspheres, which results in RL <
1 (Tables 2 and S1). Indeed, the quantity of the hydrophilic
dye Ttz, which exhibits the lowest octanol–water partition
coefficient (log Kow; Figure S3), adsorbed on the solid microspheres
was smaller than those of the other dyes (Figure 2). A similar behavior was also observed for
the adsorption of OrII (Table S1).

Figure 3 Photographs
of solid pMSt, pMEA, and pET2A microspheres (0.5 wt
%) after centrifugation in the presence of erythrosine (top) and eosin
Y (bottom) at 0.5 mM and 25 °C. The displayed values of the adsorption
capacity, Qm (mg/g), for each microsphere
were obtained from the isotherm analysis (Table 2).

In the case of solid pET2A microspheres, wherein the number
of
oxygen atoms in the side chains is twice that of pMEA (Figure 1), the adsorbed amounts of
iodine-containing dyes Ery and RB per unit gram of pET2A were close
to those of the pMEA microspheres (Figure 2), although the hydrodynamic diameter (Dh) of the pMEA microspheres (Dh = 214 nm) is smaller than that of the pET2A microspheres
(Dh = 453 nm; Table 1). As a result, the Nm/s values of Ery and RB for pET2A were higher than those for
pMEA, whereas the RL values of Ery and
RB were close to those for pMEA (Table 2), which suggests that halogen bonding occurred in
the pET2A microsphere system. Assuming that the numbers of side chains
per surface area are identical for the pMEA and pET2A microspheres,
the number of halogen-bonding sites (oxygen atoms) in pET2A is higher
than that in pMEA microspheres, which should result in an increased
amount of adsorbed iodine compounds.

On the other hand, in the
case of the pME2A microgels, where the
number of oxygen atoms is identical to that in the pET2A side chains
(Figure 1), the Langmuir
constant values of Ery and RB were lower than those of the pMEA and
pET2A microspheres (Table 2), which indicates that the strength of the halogen bonding
between pME2A and the iodine dyes is lower than that between pMEA
and pET2A. Notably, the saturated adsorption amounts of Ery and RB
per unit gram of pME2A microgels were close to those of the solid
pMEA and pET2A microspheres [e.g., for the adsorption of Ery: Qm = 119 mg/g (pET2A) and Qm = 129 mg/g (pME2A); Table 2], suggesting that the swollen microgels can absorb
low-molecular-weight compounds by osmotic pressure.48,49 This result is supported by the fact that the halogen-free dyes
Ttz and OrII were also absorbed by the pME2A and pME3A microgels (Figure 2), i.e., the Nm/v values of Ttz and OrII for these microgels
were higher than those for the solid control microgels (Table S1).

The fact that the Langmuir constants
(or RL values) of iodine-containing compounds
are different between
pET2A and pME2A cannot be explained easily, as there are several possible
factors involved: (i) the terminal ethoxy groups in the pET2A side
chains may promote the polarization more than the terminal methoxy
groups in the pME2A side chains, which would result in an increased
vectorial sum of the dipole moment in pET2A. This notion is proposed
as the polarizability of oligo(ethylene glycol) molecules depends
on the conformer and the number of ethylene glycol units,41 suggesting that the polarizability may also
depend on the number of carbon atoms and thus differ for methoxy and
ethoxy groups; (ii) The hydrophobic interaction between solid pET2A
microspheres and the dyes supports the adsorption on the surface,
which should be hard to accomplish in water-swollen pME2A microgels.
Although the iodine compounds can be diffused into the pME2A microgels,
i.e., there are many opportunities for contact with the halogen-binding
sites compared to the case of solid pET2A microspheres at 25 °C,
the Langmuir constants of iodine compounds for pET2A microspheres
were larger than those for pME2A microgels. Furthermore, the Langmuir
constants of Ery and RB for pME3A microgels, where the number of oxygen–carbon
bonds is higher than that in pME2A side chains (Figure 1), were smaller than those for pMEA, pET2A,
and pME2A (Table 2).
Therefore, we concluded that the polarizability of the entire polymer
side chain contributes to halogen-bonding and hydrophobic interactions
and represents therefore an important factor for the strong adsorption
of iodine compounds.

Conversely, the adsorbed amounts of iodine-free
compounds, including
the bromine-containing dyes EoY and PhB, on the pET2A microspheres
were smaller than those of iodine-containing dyes (Figure 2), even though the pET2A microspheres
exhibit a suitable halogen-bonding capacity for iodine compounds.
Consequently, the RL values of EoY and
PhB were close to 1 and higher than those for pMEA [e.g., at 0.1 mM
EoY: RL ∼ 0.69 (pET2A); RL ∼ 0.28 (pMEA); Table 2], which suggests that the strength of the
halogen bonding at the adsorption site in pET2A side chain decreased
compared to that in pMEA. Consequently, the iodine-containing dye
Ery was adsorbed on the pET2A microspheres, resulting in a transparent
supernatant, although EoY was also present therein (Figure 3). We therefore concluded that
the polarizability of pET2A was smaller than that of pMEA, due to
the fact that the dipole moments in the pET2A side chain are arranged
in such a fashion that they cancel each other. Accordingly, the pET2A
microspheres exhibit a halogen-bonding ability for iodine compounds,
and they do not bind significant amounts of bromine compounds. This
trend was also observed for pME2A and pME3A microgels (e.g., pME2A: RL ∼ 0.64 for Ery and RL ∼ 0.80 for EoY; Table 2).

Selective Adsorption and Release of Iodine
Compounds
To achieve a highly selective adsorption of iodine
compounds on such
microspheres, we selected the pET2A microspheres, which exhibit a
more suitable halogen-bonding ability for the adsorption of iodine
compounds than pMEA microspheres. In the present study, anionic RB
was targeted as an iodine-containing dye, and iodine-free EoY, OrII,
and Ttz were selected as competitive inhibitors for the adsorption
of RB. The visible absorption spectrum of a mixture of these four
dyes is shown in Figure S5. It should be
noted that the exact uptake of each dye cannot be quantified using
a calibration curve derived from the absorption spectrum of the dye
mixture, as the absorption peaks of Ery and PhB overlap. Figure 4 shows the adsorption
rate of each tested dye on the pMEA and pET2A microspheres (0.1 wt
%), indicating that the adsorbed amounts of RB on both microspheres
were highest when the concentrations of all dyes were comparable.
However, at low dye concentrations (e.g., 0.1 mM), the pMEA microspheres
adsorbed preferentially bromine-containing EoY rather than OrII and
Ttz (e.g., EoY: ∼35% at 0.1 mM and ∼28% at 0.5 mM; Figure 4a), suggesting that
halogen bonding also occurs between EoY and the pMEA microspheres
via the methoxy groups that are not involved in the adsorption of
RB. This phenomenon decreases the RB adsorption rate regardless of
the dye concentrations.

Figure 4 Adsorption rate for each dye on (a) pMEA and
(b) pET2A microspheres
at 25 °C using dye mixtures with different initial concentrations
of the individual dyes.

On the other hand, for the pET2A microspheres, the adsorption
of
RB accounts for ∼70% of all dyes even at dye concentrations
as low as 0.1 mM (Figure 4b). However, the maximum adsorption rate of RB reached ∼91%
at 1 mM, although the maximum rate of RB adsorbed on pMEA reached
only 65% at the same dye concentrations. Indeed, the pET2A microspheres
exhibit a high affinity for the iodine-containing compounds, while
they exhibit a low affinity for iodine-free compounds. The selectivity
of the adsorption of the iodine-containing compounds can be improved
by using the pET2A microspheres.

Finally, we examined the release
of the adsorbed iodine-containing
compounds from the pME2A microgels. Similar to the pMEA microspheres,21 the iodine-containing RB adsorbed on solid pET2A
microspheres does not desorb easily, as is evident from the quantities
of released RB as a function of temperature (Figure 5). It should be noted that the maximum adsorption
was observed at 25 °C in the presence of 1 mM RB and that the
pET2A microspheres (0.1 wt %) were subjected to these conditions prior
to evaluating the desorption behavior of RB. The results indicated
that RB remains strongly attached to the pET2A surfaces, even at 70
°C (Figure 5,
left). Here, we selected the thermoresponsive pME2A microgels to release
RB, as the Dh of the pME2A microgels decreases
with increasing temperature up to 50 °C (Figure S2b). Indeed, the released quantity of RB increased
when the temperature was raised to 50 °C, although the release
behavior did not significantly change between 50 and 70 °C (Figure 5, center). In our
previous studies on pMEA composite microgels, the chain length of
the ethylene oxides in the thermoresponsive pOEG gel matrix (five
or six carbon atoms) played an important role for the temperature-dependent
release of RB.21

Figure 5 Released amounts of RB
per unit gram of pET2A, pME2A, and pNIPAm
microspheres as a function of temperature. The white dotted bars represent
the adsorbed amounts of RB at 25 °C; anionic pNIPAm microgels
are cross-linked by N,N′-methylenebis(acrylamide)
(5 mol %).

However, this case should be different
from that of the thermoresponsive
poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAm) microgels,48,49 where the isopropyl groups form the hydrophobic domain, and the
uptake of Ery increases with rising temperature. Indeed, the anionic
pNIPAm microgels did not release significant amounts of RB upon deswelling
the pNIPAm microgels at high temperature (Figures 5, right and S6). It should also be noted that the amount of RB adsorbed in the
pNIPAm microgels, which do not contain any halogen-bonding sites,
was smaller than that of the pME2A microgels at 25 °C (e.g., Qe for RB at 1 mM: ∼140 mg/g for pME2A; Qe for RB at 1 mM: ∼70 mg/g for pNIPAm; Figure 5).

The unique
release behavior of the pME2A microgels may be due to
the fact that the thermoresponsive behavior between the pNIPAm and
the polymers that contain oligo(ethylene glycol) side chains is different.
Lutz et al. proposed a mechanism that could explain the thermoresponsive
behavior of pOEG-based polymers and gels:50 above their LCSTs, the cleavage of hydrogen bonds between the ethylene
glycol units and water should be the driving force for the phase transition.
The dehydrated oligo(ethylene glycol) chains should fold along the
apolar backbone due to hydrophobic interactions, as there are no strong
hydrogen-bond donors in pOEG-based polymers, i.e., interactions between
the oligo(ethylene glycol) side chains were be observed by 1H NMR spectroscopy or dynamic light scattering. On the other hand,
above the LCST of pNIPAm, the local packing of isopropyl groups of
two neighboring chains and/or hydrogen bonds between amide groups
should promote the formation of small hydrophobic nanopockets, where
the association of isopropyl groups minimizes the exposed surface
area.51 Thus, the formation of hydrophobic
isopropyl domains in the pNIPAm microgels inhibits the release of
organic dyes, whereas the deswollen pME2A microgels do not hamper
the release of RB at high temperature (Figure 5). We intend to further investigate the microscopic
structural changes in these pMEA-analogue microspheres in detail using
a multifaceted approach that includes small-angle X-ray scattering34,48,49 and high-speed atomic force microscopy.52

Conclusions
Highly selective adsorption
and controlled release of iodine-containing
compounds were accomplished on pMEA-analogue microspheres that contain
side chains with the ability to engage in halogen bonding with iodine-containing
compounds in water. The two ethoxy groups in the pET2A side chains
exhibit a moderate halogen-bonding strength on account of their polarizability,
i.e., iodine-containing compounds were adsorbed, whereas bromine-containing
compounds were not adsorbed in significant amounts, which was characterized
by adsorption isotherms of several anionic dyes. The results showed
that these microgels exhibit a high selectivity for the adsorption
of iodine-containing compounds in the presence of iodine-free compounds.
For example, the iodine-containing dye RB accounts for >90% of
all
adsorbed dyes. Moreover, pME2A microgels allow a controlled release
of iodine-containing dyes due to their thermoresponsive swelling/deswelling
behavior. These findings should thus represent an important first
step toward the development of highly selective separation methods
for iodine-containing compounds, which is highly important for, e.g.,
the recovery of valuable drugs, the reuse of iodine-containing catalysts,
and the removal of harmful iodine-containing compounds from wastewater.

(BIS, 97%) were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry and used as
received. 2-(2-Methoxyetoxy) ethyl acrylate (ME2A, 95%) was purchased
from Monomer-Polymer and Dajac Labs, Inc. 2-[2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]ethyl
acrylate (Me3A, 98%) was kindly donated by Kyoeisha Chemical Co.,
Ltd. The cross-linker, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA, 98%),
was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Water used
for microsphere preparations was distilled and then ion-exchanged
(EYELA, SA-2100E1).

Synthesis of pMEA Analogues and Control Microspheres
All microspheres were prepared via aqueous precipitation or emulsion
polymerization using potassium peroxodisulfate (KPS). Polymerizations
were performed in a three-necked round-bottom flask (300 mL) equipped
with a mechanical stirrer, condenser, and nitrogen gas inlet. The
initial total concentrations of each monomer for solid and hydrogel
microspheres are listed in Table 1. For pMEA-analogue microspheres, the initial total
monomer concentration was held constant at 100 mM. The monomer solutions
of ET2A (1.88 g, 100 mol %), ME2A (1.65 g, 95 mol %), and ME3A (2.07
g, 95 mol %) were prepared. The details of synthetic conditions are
shown in Table 1. These
monomers were dissolved in water (95 mL) completely in the round-bottom
flask. For pNIPAm microgels, the initial total monomer concentration
was held constant at 150 mM. A mixture of NIPAm (1.613 g, 95 mol %),
BIS (0.116 g, 5 mol %), and SDS (2.8 mg, 0.1 mM) was prepared as the
monomer solution. All monomer solutions were dissolved in water (95
mL) in the round-bottom flask and heated to 70 °C under constant
stirring (250 rpm) and a stream of nitrogen. The solutions were allowed
to stabilize for at least 30 min prior to initiation. Free-radical
polymerizations were subsequently initiated using KPS (0.054 g) in
water (5 mL). The solutions were stirred for 24 h (4 h for pNIPAm),
and after the completion of the polymerizations, the obtained dispersions
were cooled to room temperature. Each batch of microspheres was purified
via two cycles of centrifugation/redispersion in water using a relative
centrifugal force (RCF) of 20 000g, followed
by dialysis for a week with daily water changes.

Characterization
of the Microspheres
The hydrodynamic
diameter (Dh) of the microspheres was
determined by DLS (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Zetasizer Nano S). The
time-dependent scattering intensity was detected at a total scattering
angle of 173°. Dh values of the microspheres
were calculated from the measured diffusion coefficient using the
Stokes–Einstein equation (Zetasizer software v6.12). The DLS
experiments were conducted at a microsphere concentration of 0.001
wt %. The samples were allowed to thermally equilibrate at the desired
temperature for 10 min prior to each measurement. The autocorrelation
functions used an average of 15 intensity measurements (acquisition
time: 30 s). The electrophoretic mobility (EPM) of the microspheres
was measured using a Zetasizer Nano ZS instrument (Malvern) at a microsphere
concentration of 0.001 wt %. Samples were allowed to thermally equilibrate
at 25 °C for 10 min prior to each measurement. The zeta potential
of the solid microspheres was calculated from the measured mobility
using the Smoluchowski equation (Zetasizer software v10.0). Atomic
force microscopy (AFM) images were recorded under ambient conditions
using an SPM-9500J3 microscope (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) operating
in contact mode, to visualize the microspheres deposited on circular
mica substrates. For the sample preparation, microsphere dispersions
(0.5 μL) at the required concentration were applied on freshly
prepared mica substrates and dried for 60 min. AFM images were recorded
using a Si3N4 probe (Olympus, OMCL-AC240FS;
scanning speed = 0.2 Hz; operating voltage = 0.3 V).

Dye Adsorption
Experiments
Stock solutions of anionic
dyes (20 mM) in a sodium phosphate buffer (80 mM, pH = 7.0) were prepared.
The tested microsphere dispersions were poured into a vial. The final
concentration of the microspheres was 0.1 wt % for all experiments.
The microgel dispersions were allowed to thermally equilibrate at
the desired temperature for 1 h under constant stirring (300 rpm)
in an incubator (CN-25C, Mitsubishi Electric Engineering Co., Ltd.).
After the dispersions had stabilized in the incubator, the appropriate
dye stock solutions were injected into the vials. The final dye concentrations
were adjusted appropriately for the required conditions (0.1–2
mM). After 1 h of exposure, the mixtures were divided into three centrifuge
tubes (SC-0200, Ina-Optika Co., Ltd). The mixtures were centrifuged
(RCF: 20 000g) to pack the microspheres at
the bottom of each tube. The supernatant liquids were carefully removed
from the centrifuge tubes without disturbing the microsphere pellets
at the bottom, and the absorbance of each supernatant was measured
using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (JASCO, V-630iRM).

Analysis
of the Adsorption Isotherms
The Langmuir model
is based on the assumption that maximum adsorption corresponds to
the formation of a monolayer of the adsorbate on the adsorbent surface.
The energy of adsorption is constant and no transmigration of adsorbate
occurs on the surface.53 The mathematical
form of Langmuir equation is 1  where Ce (mg/L)
represents the equilibrium dye concentration in solution, Qe (mg/g) is the amount of adsorbed dyes by the
microspheres, Qm (mg/g) is the adsorption
capacity, i.e., the amount of dye that can be absorbed by a unit mass
of the adsorbent for the formation of monolayer on the surface, and b (L/mg) is the Langmuir constant, which is related to the
affinity between the dyes and microspheres. A dimensionless equilibrium
parameter (RL), known as the separation
factor, can be calculated using the following equation47 2  where C0 (mg/L)
is the initial dye concentration in solution.

The Freundlich
isotherm can be used to describe the adsorption on both homogeneous
and heterogeneous surfaces.54 The linearized
form of Freundlich isotherm is 3  where KF and n represent the Freundlich constants
that describe the adsorption
capacity at unit concentration and the intensity of adsorption, respectively.

Dye-Release Experiments
The optimal conditions for
RB adsorption were used to prepare a mixture of the microspheres and
RB in a manner described above. After the supernatant was removed
from each centrifuge tube, each microgel pellet was redispersed in
a different buffer solution at 25, 50, or 70 °C and placed in
the centrifuge tubes at concentrations identical to those used in
the adsorption experiments. Each dispersion was subsequently mixed
for 1 h at 25, 50, or 70 °C using a thermomixer (Thermomixer
R, Eppendorf). Each mixture was then centrifuged (RCF: 20 000g), and the supernatant liquids were removed from the centrifuge
tubes. The absorbance of each supernatant was subsequently measured
using a UV–vis spectrophotometer.
