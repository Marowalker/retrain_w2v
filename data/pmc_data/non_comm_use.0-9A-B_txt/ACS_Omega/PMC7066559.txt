In
the present work, a theoretical study was carried out to study
the molecular structure, harmonic vibrational frequencies, normal
force field calculations, and Raman scattering activities for fluorene
π-conjugation spacer containing azo-based dye named trans- and cis-bis(9H-fluoren-2-yl)diazene
(AzoFL) at density functional theory using B3LYP (Becke-3–Lee–Yang–Parr)
functional and 6-31+G(d,p) basis set. The theoretical calculations
have also been performed with fluorene and the trans- and cis-isomers
of diazene, difluorodiazene by the same method DFT-B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)
and basis set. The present DFT calculation shows that the trans-AzoFL is more stable than the cis-AzoFL by 16.33 kcal/mol. We also report the results of new assignments
of vibrational frequencies obtained on the basis of the present calculations.
Time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) and ZIndo calculations have been performed
to study the UV–vis absorption behavior and frontier molecular
orbitals for the above-mentioned compounds. The UV–vis spectrum
from TD-DFT calculation shows the π–π* transition
bands at λmax 423.53 nm (εmax 6.0
× 104 M–1 cm–1) and at λmax 359.45 nm (εmax 1.7
× 104 M–1 cm–1), respectively, for trans- and cis-AzoFL. Compared to parent trans-diazene (λmax 178.97 nm), a significant variation to longer wavelength
(∼245 nm) is observed due to the incorporation of the fluorene
(FL) ring into the −N=N– backbone. The co-planarity
of the two FL rings with the longer N=N bond length compared
to the unsubstituted parent diazene indicates the effective red shift
due to the extended π-conjugation in trans-AzoFL.
The nonplanarity of cis-AzoFL (48.1° tilted
about the C–N bond relative to the planar N=N–C
bond) reflects its ∼64 nm blue shift compared to that of trans-counterpart.

1 Introduction
Azo
compounds represent one of the oldest and largest class of
synthesized organic compounds used not only in dye industry1 but also in analytical chemistry as indicators
in acid–base, redox, and complexometric titration.2,3 In addition, azo compounds were reported to exhibit biological activities
such as antibacterial, antifungal, pesticides, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory
properties.4−10 Beyond their dyeing properties and biological activities, azo compounds
exhibit interesting electronic and geometrical features relating to
their application for reversible optical data storage.11−17 The storage process makes use of the light-induced trans–cis–trans
isomerization of the azo moiety, thereby utilizing the local variation
of the refractive index of the medium.11 Because of its ability to induce a molecular motion and a significant
geometric change upon trans ⇆ cis photoisomerization, azo compounds
can be utilized for the construction of light-driven molecular devices.18,19

The light induced changes in the molecular structure and physical
properties of azo moiety associated with E ⇆ Z photoisomerization have led to the incorporation of azobenzene
into a wide variety of molecular architectures including polymers,
dendrimers, liquid crystals, self-assembled monolayers, and biomaterials.20−25 Because trans-azobenzene shows intense π–π*
absorption in the UV region, the rapid trans-to-cis isomerization
can be induced by noncoherent UV light. The cis isomer has an enhanced
n−π* absorption in the visible region; the cis-to-trans
isomerization is triggered through visible-light irradiation.20 The light-driven structural changes of the azobenzene
unit incorporated into a larger compound affect the properties of
azo-functionalized molecular systems.18 Emerging applications of azo compounds require the extension of
π-conjugated systems of azo derivatives to design visible-light-driven
switches.26−30 The increasing π-conjugated length allows for more obvious
red shift of azo π → π* transition bands.26 Therefore, the synthesis of azo-containing π-conjugated
compounds attracts considerable attention because of the possible
red shifts of azo π → π* transition bands and novel
optoelectrical properties.26 On the basis
of these fascinating features and properties of azo-containing π-conjugated
compounds, our aim in this present work is to provide a purely theoretical
perspective on the optimized geometries, orbital energies (HOMO, LUMO),
IR, Raman activity, and UV–vis spectra of trans and cis-bis(9H-fluoren-2-yl)diazene
(AzoFL) (Figure 1).

The valuable electronic properties of fluorene-based compounds,
characterized by extensive π conjugation together with their
photochemical features, make them promising candidates for use in
organic light-emitting diodes,31,32 solar cells,33,34 and field-effect transistors.35,36 In an effort to gain
a better understanding of the structure and electronic properties
of difluorene-substituted diazene, in this paper we have investigated
the optimized geometries and vibrational and absorption spectra of cis and trans-bis(9H-fluoren-2-yl)diazene
(Figure 1) and compared
them with those of fluorene, cis, and trans isomers of diazene and
difluorodiazene (Figure 2) using the same method and basis set.

Figure 2 Structures of fluorene
and cis and trans isomers of diazene and
difluorodiazene.

All of the calculations
for the above-mentioned three pairs of
azo compounds and fluorene are calculated by the same widely used
density functional theory37 (DFT) which
has capability to produce different results with high accuracy and
better consistency.11,37−44 In spite of the vast literature on the studies of photoisomerization
and other photophysical properties of azo dyes by means of various
spectroscopic and photochemical methods, the chemistry of azo compounds
are not well understood completely yet. This is probably due to the
fact that sometimes it is difficult to isolate cis- and trans-isomers
of the azo compounds in pure form possibly due to reversible cis–trans
isomerization of the compounds. Thereby, the determination of the
different properties of a pure isomer of azo compound is not straightforward.
In this paper, our target is to investigate the different properties
of the cis- and trans-isomers of azo fluorene individually and compare
them with those of the parent diazene, fluorine, and difluorodiazene
using the same DFT method and same basis set by theoretical aspect.
The findings of this study might be important to understand the chemistry
of π-conjugated azo compounds.

The optimized geometry parameters
(Table 1) show that
the trans-AzoFL
is almost planar (central CNNC dihedral angle: 179.99°) according
to our DFT calculation. Complete geometry optimization for cis-AzoFL in present work resulted in nonplanarity (central
CNNC dihedral angle: 10.9°) of the molecule. The fluorene (FL)
rings are rotated by 48.1° about the C–N bond relative
to planar N=N–C arrangement to decrease the H–H
non bonded interaction in cis-AzoFL. According to
our DFT calculation the energy difference shows that the trans-AzoFL in its ground state is more stable than the cis-AzoFL by 16.33 kcal/mol (Table 3).

The trans-AzoFL
has no dipole moment, whereas
the cis-AzoFL exhibits a dipole moment of 3.12 D.
However, our semiempirical AM1 calculation shows that the cis-AzoFL is more stable by 4.18 kcal/mol (Table 3) compared to that of trans-AzoFL, which possess some deviation from planarity
having a bit dipole moment (0.17 D).

Our calculated geometry
parameters at B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) for trans-DZ (Table 2) (NN: 1.244 Å,
NH: 1.036 Å, ∠NNH: 106.7°)
is well agreed with the earlier reported experimental value (NN: 1.247
Å, NH: 1.029 Å, ∠NNH: 106.3°)45 and theoretical work46 (NN:
1.238 Å, NH: 1.035 Å, ∠NNH: 107°) by B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p)
method. The calculated work47 by CCSD(T)/CBS
found (NN: 1.246 Å, NH: 1.029 Å, ∠NNH: 106.4°)
which also has good agreement with our present work (Table 2). The geometric parameters
(Table 2) for cis-diazene (NN: 1.242 Å, NH: 1.043 Å, ∠NNH:
113°) calculated by present B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) method is also
quite well agreed with the earlier reported (NN: 1.237 Å, NH:
1.041 Å), (∠NNH: 113°) by B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) method.48 All of the ground-state geometries were verified
by vibrational frequency analysis at the same level of theory and
found as true minima because negative vibrational frequencies were
absent in all cases.

The calculated energies (hartree), energy
differences (kcal/mol)
between the cis- and trans-isomers of AzoFL, DFDZ, and DZ and their
respective dipole moments (debye) are summarized in Table 3. The trans-AzoFL was found as more stable than the cis-AzoFL
by the calculation at B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p). Similarly trans-DZ was also found stable as compared to cis-DZ.
Back et al.48 by near-ultraviolet absorption
investigation of diazene in gas phase showed that the trans-DZ was the most stable isomer. However, the cis-DFDZ was found as more stable (Table 3) by 1.81 kcal/mol than the trans-DFDZ
by B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p), which supports the preference of cis-DFDZ energetically by the earlier work.49 The trans- and cis-isomers of AzoFL in ground state adopted the
C2 symmetry, whereas the trans-DZ and trans-DFDZ adopt the C2h point groups. The cis-DZ, cis-DFDZ, and FL possess C2v points group. We have made a comparative study of the N=N,
N–H, H–F, C–N, C–C, and C–H bond
lengths as well as C–N=N and C–C–N bond
angles in DZ, FL, DFDZ, and AzoFL. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, we have found
that the N=N bond lengths of trans-isomers of DZ, DFDZ, and
AzoFL, are 1.244, 1.225, and 1.262 Å, respectively. The N=N
bond length order among the three trans-isomers has been found as
AzoFL > DZ > DFDZ by our DFT-B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) calculation,
and the
same trend has been observed for the respective cis-isomers as well.
Upon substitution in the parent trans-DZ molecule
by two electron donor fluorene (FL) moiety causes an increase of the
N=N bond distance from 1.244 to 1.262; an 0.018 Å increase
of bond length is observed. This is due to the extensive π-bond
conjugation of the N=N bond with the fluorene (FL) ring in
trans-isomer of AzoFL. On the other hand, incorporation of the two
F atoms in the parent DZ by replacing two H-atoms causes shortening
of the N=N bond length from 1.244 to 1.225 Å (Table 2) in trans-DFDZ. Hence, an opposite trend, a decrease of 0.019 Å is observed
in trans-DFDZ compared to that of trans-DZ. This effect is stronger in cis-DFDZ, a bit
shorter of 0.025 Å N=N bond length in cis-DFDZ is found compared to cis-DZ (Table 2).

As aromatic fluorene
(FL) moiety is the major structural unit of
our target AzoFL, we have calculated FL for comparison even though
there are detailed experimental50 as well
as some theoretical works44 present in
the literature. Our calculated structure of FL (Table 1) by B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) is well agreed with
the reported work done by Lee and Boo44 calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. There is reasonable agreement
found with the reported X-ray crystal structure.51 A minor deviation was observed with the X-ray crystal structure51 of bond angles, for example, ∠C1C10C11 by 1.43°.

Our DFT calculation
shows that the FNN angle in the trans-DFDZ is 105.1°
whereas the same angle in cis-form is 114.9°.
Our HF calculation shows that the FNN angle in the trans-form is 106.9°,
whereas the same angle in cis-form is 114.4°. This supports earlier
work.49 As fluorine atoms are electronegative,
they have stronger electron affinity relative to the nitrogen atoms
and possibility to polarize the bonds. The cis-isomer has a small
dipole moment (0.22 D), whereas the trans-DFDZ has
no dipole moment according to our present B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) calculation.

The N=N bond length of cis-DFDZ is found
to be shorter (Table 2) than that of the corresponding trans-DFDZ by our
B3LYP-DFT/6-31+G(d,p) calculation. On the contrary, the N–F
bond (1.399 Å) in cis-DFDZ is longer (0.004
Å) than its trans-counterpart (1.395 Å). It should be mentioned
that the shortening of the N=N bond in conjunction with elongation
of the N–F bond indicates the presence of negative hyperconjugation.49,55 This difference in geometrical parameters leads to a higher stability
of the cis-DFDZ, which is nicely reflected in our
DFT-B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) calculation. In addition, a considerable widening
of ∠NNF has been observed for cis-DFDZ (Table 2) compared to that
of trans-DFDZ. The reason for such type of structural
change is due to repulsion of the F atom lone pairs, the electrostatic
repulsion of the N–F dipolar bonds, and steric effect.49 Such type of structural/geometrical change has
also been observed by earlier work.49,55,56 In our DFT-B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) calculation, the two
C–N bonds in cis-AzoFL is also found to be
longer by (0.019 Å) compared to that of trans-AzoFL, whereas the same bond is longer by only 0.006 Å in semiempirical
AM1 (Table 1).

The N=N bond of DZ, DFDZ, and AzoFL (Tables 1 and 2) is shorter
in cis-isomer over trans-isomer by 0.015, 0.024, and 0.027 Å
in semiempirical AM1 method. Similar behavior, that is, shorter N=N
bond in DZ, DFDZ, and AzoFL by 0.002, 0.008, and 0.01 Å by DFT/6-31+G(d,p)
method.

Our result from semiempirical AM1 method shows the preference
of
cis-isomer over trans-isomer (Table 3) by 4.58 and 10.4 kcal/mol for AzoFL and DFDZ, respectively.
On the other hand, the parent trans-DZ isomer is
stable by 0.88 kcal/mol over cis-DZ. The preference
of cis-AzoFL over the trans-isomer by AM1 method
is not clear, but the preference of cis-isomer over trans-isomer for
DFDZ due to cis-effect is known in the literature
for dihalodiazenes.49,52,55,56 Different explanations were found for the
cis-effect in the literature by different authors, viz., (i) the sum
of the repulsive forces between the N lone pairs and between the two
N–F bonds is less in cis-DFDZ compared to
that of the trans-DFDZ,57 (ii) mutual interplay of various interactions, for example, antiperiplanar
interaction, Coulombic interaction, and lone pair-lone pair interaction
in diazene moiety.49 (iii) delocalization
of the N lone pair over the antibonding orbital of the adjacent N–F
bond along with the lone pair delocalization of F over the antibonding
orbital of the N=N bond,58 and (iv)
mutual interactions between the nitrogen lone pairs and the neighboring
antibonding orbital of the N–X bond (X = F, Cl, Br).56 The shorter N=N bond length is also observed
in the parent and unsubstituted cis-DZ along with
longer N–H and wider NNH angle compared to that of trans-DZ. However, the parent trans-DZ
isomer is stable by 0.88 kcal/mol over cis-DZ, and
the cis-effect, that is, the stability of cis-DZ over trans-DZ was not observed in
our both the DFT and semiempirical AM1 calculation in accordance with
different previous work.49,55 Because DZ contains
no F atoms, as a consequence there are no lone pair electrons for
delocalization of halogen lone pairs into the antibonding orbitals
of N=N bond. This could be the inability of parent cis-DZ to get any stabilizing energy via delocalization
effects and causes preference of trans-isomer.55

An attempt were also taken to observe the cis effect
by the HF method using three different basis sets, for example, 6-31+G(d,p),
6-31++G(d,p), and 6-311+G(d,p), respectively for DFDZ. The ab initio
Hartree–Fock produces insignificant but somewhat longer N=N
bond length by 0.00044 Å in cis-DZ (1.21530
Å) over trans-DZ (1.21486 Å) using 6-31+G(d,p)
basis set. Similar insignificant longer N=N bond length is
also observed in cis-DFDZ by 0.00115 and 0.00244
Å over trans-DFDZ by HF using 6-31+G(d,p) and
6-311+G(d,p) basis set, respectively. The N–F bond of cis-DFDZ is also found to be longer compared to trans-DFDZ by 0.00173 and 0.00056 Å in HF/6-31+G(d,p)
and 6-311+G(d,p) basis sets. In HF both the 6-31+G(d,p) and 6-311+G(d,p)
basis sets produces longer N=N bond and N–F bond. In
both cases, they have larger FNN bond angles. The FNN bond angle of cis-DFDZ is 0.2° in wider by HF/6-311+G(d,p) basis
set compared to HF/6-311+G(d,p) over trans-isomer. The HF calculation
shows that 6-31+G(d,p) and 6-31++G(d,p) basis set produces the same
geometric parameters and equal energy (Table 3). However, energetically preference of the cis-DFDZ was not found by all of the basis sets of HF methods
by our present work. Earlier work by HF49,55 with small
basis set and the SS-MRCCSD/aug-cc-pVDZ55 calculation was also unable to show the cis-effect.

2.2 Electronic Absorption Spectra
The
photophysical properties of trans- and cis-AzoFL consisting of donor (fluorene ring) and acceptor (−N=N−)
azo group have been investigated in gas phase by theoretical calculation.
The UV–vis absorption spectra of parent trans- and cis-DZ, electron withdrawing F atom-containing
difluorodiazene (DFDZ) and FL were calculated and made comparison
with the model compound AzoFL. In the past decade, time-dependent
DFT (TD-DFT) has become the leading method for the calculation of
excitation energies and optical properties of organic molecules.59−62 Starting from the each fully optimized ground-state structures of
B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p), TD-DFT excited-state calculations with the hybrid
functional B3LYP and 6-31+G(d,P) basis set were calculated on the
three lowest spin allowed singlet–singlet transitions for the
above-mentioned azo compounds and fluorene in the gas phase. The calculated
UV–vis spectra of those compounds are shown in Figure 5. The theoretical excitation
energies (Eex), oscillator strengths (f), and absorption wavelengths (λmax) are
listed in Tables 4–6. All of the transition probabilities
of the different trans- and cis-azo
compounds by TD-DFT calculation are given in Tables 4 and 5, respectively.

The present TD-DFT calculations
show that the model trans-AzoFL afforded characteristics
broad and long-waved absorption band
around 300–700 nm (Figure 5a). The band at λmax 423.53 nm is
very high with a molar extinction coefficient εmax 6.0 × 104 M–1 cm–1, which is indicative of the π–π* transition63 (S0–S2) in trans-AzoFL. On the other hand, the band for n−π*
transition was not observed in trans-AzoFL by TD-DFT
calculation. The spectra (Figure 5a) of cis-AzoFL shows the disappearance
of the band at λmax 423.53 nm, while a well resolved
band at 359.45 nm (S0–S2) for π–π*
and a second band at 517.82 nm (S0–S1) for n−π* transition, respectively, was observed (Figure 5a). The band at 359.45
nm (π–π*) is decreased in intensity (εmax 1.7 × 104 M–1 cm–1), whereas the n−π* transition band at
517 nm has strong εmax 7.0 × 103 M–1 cm–1 absorbance compared to that
of other azo compounds under study. The absorption band for the π–π*
transition in cis-AzoFL shifts to shorter wavelength
at λmax 359 45 nm, a 64.08 nm blue shift is observed
compared to that of trans-AzoFL. The broad band at
λmax 517.82 nm (n−π*) transition for cis-AzoFL (Figure 5a) is shifted to longer wavelength compared to all other cis-azo compounds by present TD-DFT calculation.

Liu
and co-workers26 investigated the
UV–vis spectrum of 1,2-bis(9,9-dioctyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)diazene
in 1,2-dichloroethane (concentration of the compound is 0.02 g/L)
and found the experimental absorption maxima (λmax) for π–π* transition at 394 nm and n−π*
transition at 500 nm. They26 also performed
TD-DFT calculation at the level of ONIOM (M06-2x/6-31G*: AM1), and
the calculated absorption maximum (π–π* transition)
of 1,2-bis(9,9-dioctyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)diazene was
found at 345 nm. These results supports our TD-DFT calculated UV–vis
spectra of trans-AzoFL (π–π* transition
band at λmax 423.53 nm) at the level of B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)
in gas phase.

Bagheri and Hashemianzadeh34 employed
TD-DFT calculations with B3LYP/6-311+G** basis set, based on the optimized
geometries of B3LYP/6-311+G** for azo dye-containing fluorene derivative
at one end and 4-carboxyphenyl group at the other end of the azo group
(−N=N−). The TD-DFT calculated maximum wavelengths
(π–π* transition) of the azo dye34 are shown at 405.41 nm in gas phase and at 438.62 nm in
THF in UV–vis absorption spectra. The steady-state UV–visible
absorption spectrum of trans-azobenzene in n-hexane shows one weak band at 445 nm assigned for the
n−π* transition (S1 state) and a stronger
band at 315 nm for π–π* transition (S2 state) by Lednev et al.64 The n−π*
transition is very weaker (ε ≈ 400 M–1 cm–1) and is not allowed in the trans-isomer of
azobenzene compounds by symmetry rules. However, the electronic transition
n−π* (380–520 nm) is allowed in cis-isomer, resulting
in an increase in intensity with respect to the trans-isomer in azobenzene
compounds.65,66

The present TD-DFT calculation
performed by our group shows that
the parent trans-DZ (Figure 5b) has λmax 178.97 nm (εmax 1.4 × 103 M–1 cm–1) for π–π* (S0–S3) transition. The n−π* transition band in the
parent trans-DZ was also not observed similar to trans-AzoFL. The band at 178.97 nm in cis-DZ (Figure 5b) completely
disappears and instead of that two new well-separated nice bands at
λmax 205.43 nm (εmax 1.2 ×
103 M–1 cm–1) for π–π*
(S0–S2) and at λmax 371.78
nm (εmax 200 M–1 cm–1) for n−π* (S0–S1) transition,
respectively, is found. It is also observed that in cis-DZ (Figure 5b), the
λmax at 205.43 nm (εmax 1.2 ×
103 M–1 cm–1) for π–π*
transition is decreased in intensity compared to that of trans-DZ λmax 178.97 nm (εmax 1.4 ×
103 M–1 cm–1) and shifts
to longer wavelength.

Figure 5d shows
a broad band around 200–350 nm for fluorene (FL). The three
bands (Figure 5d inset,
half-width at half height 0.033 eV) at 256.82 nm (S0–S3), 265.77 nm (S0–S2), and 276.39
nm (S0–S1) merge together at λmax 265.77 nm (εmax 1.6 × 103 M–1 cm–1) for the π–π*
transition (S0–S2).

It is crystal
like clear that a significant variation on the absorption
spectra of AzoFL occurred by incorporation of the fluorene (FL) ring
into the −N=N– backbone (Figure 5). The same trend in extinction-coefficient,
that is, much higher extinction-coefficient and higher oscillator
strength in trans-AzoFL in comparison with that of
parent trans-DZ (Figure 5) is observed.

The results show that
incorporation of the FL ring into the −N=N–
back bone causes bathochromic shifts of both the trans- and cis-AzoFL and higher extinction-coefficient (Figure 5a,d). A 157.76 and 93.68 nm
wavelength increment is observed compared to FL in trans- and cis-AzoFL, respectively, for π–π*
transition band. The weak band for n−π* (S0–S1) transition at λmax 371.78
nm (εmax 200 M–1 cm–1) for cis-diazene shifts to λmax 517.82 nm (εmax 7.0 × 103 M–1 cm–1) in cis-AzoFL,
a red shift of 146.04 nm is observed with higher intensity. On the
other hand, the intensity of the π–π* band in both
the cis-DZ and cis-AzoFL causes
hypochromic effect by TD-DFT calculation compared to the corresponding
trans-isomers.

In trans-AzoFL, the absorption
maxima λmax 423.53 nm of π–π*
transition showed
an obvious red shift of ∼245 nm increment to longer wavelength
compared to that of trans-diazene (λmax 178.97 nm). This effective red shift is attributed due to the extended
π-conjugation length which reflects the longer N=N bond
length of AzoFL (Table 1). Even a 154.02 nm of wavelength increment toward longer wave length
is observed in cis-azoFL (λmax 359.45
nm) compared to that of cis-diazene (λmax 205.43 nm). Because of coplanarity of the two FL rings
in trans-isomer, the π–π* transition band shifts
to lower energy longer wavelength compared to that of cis-AzoFL.

Introducing two F atoms into the −N=N–
backbone
in DFDZ shows interesting results. The trans-DFDZ
(Figure 5c) has a band
at λmax 189.32 nm (S0–S2) with low absorbance. The molar absorptivity was found only εmax ≈ 420 M–1 cm–1 with low oscillator strength (0.0111). It is expected that π–π*
transition should have high molar absorptivity usually at εmax ≈ 104 M–1 cm–1, but this unusual result is surprising. The π–π*
transition band at λmax 189.32 nm of trans-DFDZ causes a red shift of 10.35 nm compared to that of trans-DZ (λmax 178.97 nm, εmax ≈ 1.4 × 103 M–1 cm–1).

In cis-DFDZ, a broad band
appeared at λmax ≈ 190 nm with low molar absorptivity
(εmax ≈ 500 M–1 cm–1) by Gaussian UV–vis peak half-width at half height (0.333
eV) in UV–vis spectra (Figure 5c). However, the band was found as separated bands
at λmax 180.82 nm (S0–S3, f = 0.0058) and λmax 192.79 nm
(S0–S2, f = 0.0104)
(Figure 5c, inset)
at UV–vis peak half-width at half height (0.033 eV). Compared
to cis-DZ (λmax 205.43 nm, εmax 1.2 × 103 M–1 cm–1), cis-DFDZ (λmax ≈ 190 nm, εmax ≈ 500 M–1 cm–1) shows a blue shift of 15.43 nm with reduced
molar absorptivity. The cis-DFDZ (λmax ≈ 190 nm, εmax ≈ 500 M–1 cm–1) and trans-DFDZ (λmax 189.32 nm, εmax ≈ 420 M–1 cm–1) shows a similar type of absorption behavior
(Figure 5c).

In order to examine the TD-DFT excited-state behavior of the DZ
and DFDZ, a further investigation was carried out (Table S1). TD-DFT//B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) calculations by using
different initial geometries obtained from HF/6-31+G(d,p) and HF/6-31++G(d,p)
basis sets were done. The two initial geometries gave the similar
results by TD-DFT//B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) calculations. In trans-DFDZ, a band appeared at λmax ≈ 168 nm with
low molar absorptivity (εmax ≈450 M–1 cm–1) by Gaussian UV–vis peak half-width
at half height (0.333 eV) in UV–vis spectra (Figure S1a). However, the band was found as separated bands
at λmax 161.62 nm (S0–S3, f = 0.0092) and λmax 172.36 nm
(S0–S2, f = 0.0067)
(Figure S1a, inset) at UV–vis peak
half-width at half height (0.233 eV). By using HF/6-31+G(d,p) as initial
geometry in TD-DFT//B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) calculation, the absorptivity
is enhanced in some extent and causes a ∼17 nm red shift in cis-DFDZ (λmax 185.82 nm, S0–S1,f = 0.0181, εmax ∼750 M–1 cm–1) compared
to trans-DFDZ (λmax 168 nm, εmax ≈ 450 M–1 cm–1).

ZIndo excited-state calculations with the predefined STO-3G
basis
set by using optimized geometries of semiempirical AM1 as the initial
structure were also calculated on the three lowest spin allowed singlet–singlet
transitions for the above-mentioned azo compounds and FL in the gas
phase. The electronic transition data, for example, the theoretical
excitation energies (Eex), oscillator
strengths (f), and absorption wavelengths (λmax) are listed in the Tables 4, S2 and S3. The calculated
UV–vis spectra of the three pairs of azo compounds and FL by
ZIndo are shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Calculated UV–vis spectra of (a) trans-
and cis-AzoFL with FL (b) trans-
and cis-DZ (c) trans- and cis-DFDZ by ZIndo. The calculated UV–vis spectra
are represented with a Gaussian UV–vis peak half-width at half
height 0.333 eV or 2685.83 cm–1.

ZIndo produces nice bands for π–π* and
n−π*
transitions for the three pairs of azo compounds. The π–π*
transition band of trans- and cis-AzoFL were observed at λmax 387.20 nm and λmax 355.21 nm, respectively, by ZIndo. As shown in (Figures 5 and 6), similar behavior and same spectral pattern were observed
by introducing FL ring into the backbone of −N=N–
unit. A nice bathochromic shift (Figure 6a) of π–π* transition
band of trans-AzoFL (λmax 387.20
nm, εmax 6.0 × 104 M–1 cm–1) and cis-AzoFL (λmax 355.21 nm, εmax 3.0 × 104 M–1 cm–1) compared to that of
FL (λmax 296.84 nm, εmax 1.85 ×
104 M–1 cm–1) were
observed. A comparison of π–π* transition band
of cis- and trans-AzoFL with parent trans-DZ (λmax 140.80 nm (S0 → S3), εmax 2.1 × 104 M–1 cm–1) and cis-DZ (λmax 135.98 (S0 →
S3), εmax 2.0 × 104 M–1 cm–1) also shows that cis- and trans-AzoFL are red-shifted by ZIndo method.

The cis- and trans-DFDZ also
shows some extent of red shift compared to that of corresponding isomers
of DZ.

The assignment of n−π* transition band of
the above-mentioned cis-compounds is straightforward.
The transition bands (n−π*)
are at λmax 545.64 nm (εmax 950
M–1 cm–1), λmax 524.24 nm (εmax 400 M–1 cm–1), and λmax 233.92 nm (εmax 2 × 103 M–1 cm–1) for cis-AzoFL, cis- DZ, and cis-DFDZ respectively. The n−π*transition band
of both the cis-AzoFL and cis-DFDZ
is red-shifted compared to that of cis-DZ.

Though the ZIndo produces n−π* transition band in trans-AzoFL at λmax 562.02 nm (εmax ≈ 450, f = 0.0105, Gaussian UV–vis
peak half-width at half height 0.233 eV) but the n−π*
bands were not seen in trans-DFDZ and parent trans-DZ in both the DFT and ZIndo method.

Unlike
the spectral pattern obtained from TD-DFT method, ZIndo
produces well-separated π–π* (S0 →
S3) and n−π* (S0 → S2) transition bands at λmax 169.51 nm (εmax 1.4 × 104, f = 0.3671)
and λmax 233.92 nm (εmax 1.4 ×
104, f = 0.0543), respectively, for cis-DFDZ (Figure 6c). A slight blue shift and small hypochromic effect for π–π*
transition were observed for the parent DZ and DFDZ compared to that
of respective trans-isomers by ZIndo method. In trans-DFDZ, the transition of (S0 → S3) at
163.06 nm (f = 0.0524) is underneath the π–π*
transition band (S0 → S2) at 175.65 nm
(f = 0.4028).

It is noteworthy that using DFT/6-31+G(d,p)
as initial geometry
in TD-DFT//B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) calculation, there is no significant
differences were observed between absorption spectra of cis and trans-DFDZ (Figure 5c). However, with different initial geometry,
HF/6-31+G(d,p) was used in TD-DFT//B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) calculation,
and the π–π* transition band of trans-DFDZ was blue-shifted (∼17 nm) compared to cis-DFDZ (Figure S1a). In the case of ZIndo
method, trans-DFDZ was red-shifted (∼6 nm)
compared to cis-DFDZ (Figure 6c).

2.3 Frontier Molecular Orbitals
The highest
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest-lying unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) are known as frontier molecular orbital (FMO).
The molecular orbital is a mathematical function that describes the
behavior of an electron or a pair of electrons within a molecule.67 These functions are plotted as surfaces around
the molecular structure. The HOMO represents the ability to donate
an electron, on the other hand LUMO as an electron acceptor. The energy
gap between the HOMO and LUMO determines not only the chemical reactivity
and kinetic stability, but also optical and electrical properties
of a molecule.68

The energies of
six important molecular orbitals and the 3D plots of the third HOMO
[HOMO – 2], second highest [HOMO – 1], and the highest
HOMO, the lowest unoccupied MO [LUMO], second lowest unoccupied MOs
[LUMO + 1], and the third lowest unoccupied MOs [LUMO + 2] of the
model compound AzoFL calculated using B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) basis set
at DFT level of theory are shown in Figures 7 and 8. The energy
values of HOMO, LUMO, and energy gap between them, Eg (HOMO–LUMO), and dipole moments of the ground
and excited states of the AzoFL, DFDZ; parent DZ and FL are listed
in Table 7.

The model trans-AzoFL compound has a total of
610 alpha orbitals, out of which 94 are occupied and the remaining
516 are virtual orbitals. The orbital 94 represents HOMO, whereas
orbital 95 represents LUMO orbitals. In our analyses, we found that
the energy values of HOMO and LUMO are −5.72 and −2.51
eV, respectively, in trans-AzoFL (Figure 7, Table 7).

It is evident from Figures 7 and 8 that the HOMO and LUMO are localized
on almost the whole molecule showing π- and π*-bonding
MO, respectively. HOMO – 1 is localized on the N=N linkage,
C2, C1, and C2′, C1′ atoms of the trans-AzoFL ring with almost no participation of the FL linker groups
(Figure 7). The energy
separation between the HOMO and the LUMO of trans-AzoFL is 3.21 eV, whereas the value is 3.28 eV for cis-AzoFL (Table 7).
The HOMO (94a)–LUMO (95b) transition implies for π–π*(S0–S2) transition with 99% probability (Table 6).

The 3D FMOs
of FL, DZ, and DFDZ are shown in Figures 9–13, respectively.
Both the trans-DZ and cis-DZ has
a total of 48 alpha molecular orbitals, out of which 8 are occupied
and the remaining 40 are virtual orbitals. The orbital 8 represents
HOMO whereas 9 represents LUMO orbitals in DZ. In trans-DZ HOMO – 1 is π-bonding MO whereas in cis-DZ HOMO – 2 is π-bonding MO. LUMO is showing π*-antibonding
MO. The LUMO + 2 in both the cis- and trans-diazene are showing similar behavior.

The orbitals 16 and 17 represent the HOMO and LUMO, respectively,
in both the cis- and trans- DFDZ.
The LUMO pattern of both the trans- and cis-DFDZ looks similar, whereas HOMO is different (Figures 12 and 13). The lone pairs on the nitrogen atoms are jot out in the plane
of the molecule as seen in the HOMO of trans-DFDZ
(Figure 12). The HOMO–LUMO
energies and gap (Eg) between the HOMO–LUMO
are given in the Table 7.

From the HOMO and LUMO energies, global reactivity descriptor
properties
can be calculated.69−72 The ionization potential I and electron affinity A are equal to orbital energies of HOMO and LUMO as I = −EHOMO and A = −ELUMO. The ionization
potential I and electron affinity A are found as 5.72 and 2.51 eV
(Table 8), respectively,
for trans-AzoFL. The electronegativity χ =
(I + A)/2, chemical potential, μ
= −χ, chemical hardness η = (I – A)/2, chemical softness, S = 1/η, electrophilicity index (ω) = μ2/2η, respectively, is calculated and tabulated in Table 8. The global reactivity
descriptors of FL and trans- and cis-AzoFL, DZ, and DFDZ are summarized and given in the Table 8.

2.4 Assignments of Vibrational
Frequencies
Nowadays, description of theoretical vibrational
spectra has attracted
much attention not only for the identification of different compounds
but also for spectrochemical investigation. There have been several
theoretical reports on vibrational frequencies for trans-azobenzene in the ground state at the MP2, DFT, and CASSCF levels.11,73−77 As far as we are aware, there have been no previous reports on detailed
descriptions of vibrational frequencies of azofluorene compounds.
In an effort to gain a better understanding of the vibrational frequencies
of both cis and trans-isomers of our studied azo compounds, we have
calculated IR and Raman scattering activities at the level of DFT-B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p).
As fluorene (FL) moiety and the −N=N– are the
major structural unit of our target AzoFL, at first we have calculated
and discussed theoretically predicted IR and Raman scattering activity
spectra of the parent DZ, DFDZ, and FL for comparison even though
there is experimental49 as well as some
theoretical work44 present in the literature.

The IR and the Raman activity spectra calculated by B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)
basis set at DFT level of theory of the trans- and cis-DZ, DFDZ, respectively, are shown in Figures 14 and 15 and their vibrational assignments of the fundamental modes along
with their calculated IR and Raman activity intensities, frequencies,
and normal mode of vibrations along with the respective force constants
are given in Tables 9 and 10. Generally, force constants help us
to know the strength of the bond and molecular stability.

2.4.1 N–H Vibration in DZ
Among
six vibrational modes in trans-N2H2 (DZ), three modes were found as IR inactive, viz., 1596.94
(Ag, ip NH), 1659.03 (Ag, str N=N), and 3251.64 (Ag, sym str
NH) cm–1 (Figure 14a) but found as Raman scattering active (Figure 14b). The asymmetric
N–H stretching, in-plane and out-of-plane N–H vibrations
observed at 3280.65 (Bu), 1348.64 (Bu), and 1344.41 (Au) cm–1 were found as IR active mode, but Raman inactive mode.

In cis-DZ, among the six vibration modes, five modes are found
as IR active, for example, 1354.10 (A1), 1538.87 (B2), 1662.43 (A1), 3088.26 (B2), and 3185.08
(A1) cm–1. The out-of-plane twist mode
of NH at 1269.07 (A2) cm–1 is Raman active
but appears as very weak peak. In cis-isomer two peaks are observed
for NH stretching vibration at 3088 for asymmetric and at 3185 cm–1 for symmetric stretching vibration in both the IR
and Raman activity spectra (Figure 14c,d). The six vibrational modes of trans- and cis-DZ by DFT-B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) calculation
are shown in Figures S3 and S4.

On
the other hand, in trans-DZ the asymmetric
stretching of NH at 3280 cm–1 is IR active, but
NH symmetric stretching vibration at 3251.63 cm–1 is IR inactive. Reversed trend is observed in Raman activity spectrum
for trans-DZ (Table 9).

Jensen et al.78 mentioned the different
vibrational mode as 1526 (ω1 N–N), 3154 (ω2 N–H sym), 3197 (ω3 N–H asym),
1663 (ω4 N–N–H sym), 1374 (ω5 N–N–H asym), and 1351 (ω6 tor)
cm–1 for trans-DZ by CASSCF. Craig
and Levin79 mentioned the experimental
values as 1529 (N–N), 3128 (N–H sym), 3120 (N–H
asym), 1582 (N–N–H sym), 1322 (N–N–H asym),
and 1286 (tor) cm–1. On the other hand, Hwang and
Mebel80 found the values at much higher
frequencies at 1525 (N–N), 3382 (N–H sym), 3353 (N–H
asym), 1628 (N–N–H sym), 1360 (N–N–H asym),
and 1349 (tor) cm–1 by high-level G2M(MP2)//MP2/G-31G*
calculation.

For cis-DZ, the vibrational modes
are found by
Jensen et al.78 at 1535 (ω1 N–N), 3144 (ω2 N–H sym), 3074 (ω3 N–H asym), 1416 (ω4 N–N–H
sym), 1616 (ω5 N–N–H asym), and 1267
(ω6 tor) cm–1 by CASSCF.

The experimental values at 1558 (ω1 N–N),
2966 (ω2 N–H sym), 2884 (ω3 N–H asym), 1390 (ω4 N–N–H
sym), 1439 (ω5 N–N–H asym), and 1259
(ω6 tor) cm–1 by Craig and Levin79 estimated from the approximate force field of trans-DZ. On the other hand Hwang and Mebel80 found the values at much higher frequencies at 1562 (ω1 N–N), 3306 (ω2 N–H sym), 3225
(ω3 N–H asym), 1373 (ω4 N–N–H
sym), 1567 (ω5 N–N–H asym), and 1287
(ω6 tor) cm–1 by high level G2M(MP2)//MP2/G-31G*
calculation. Biczysko et al.81 mentioned
additional comparison for different parameters of both the trans-DZ and cis-DZ by different authors.

2.4.2 N–F Vibration in DFDZ
The
different vibrational modes of trans-DFDZ at 361.43
(AU), 418.81 (BU), 604.31 (AG), 996.45 (BU), 1034.89 (AG), and 1628.78
(AG) cm–1 of our present calculation is very close
to the experimental work82 viz. 364 (AU),
423 (BU), 603 (AG), 991 (BU), 1018 (AG), and 1523 (AG) cm–1. The six vibrational modes of trans- and cis-DFDZ by present DFT-B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) calculation are
shown in Figures S5 and S6.

Among
six vibrational modes in trans-N2F2 (DFDZ), three modes were found as IR active (Figure 15a) by our B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)
calculation. The out-of-plane FNN, in-plane FNN, and asymmetric N–F
stretching vibrations observed at 361.43, 418.86, and 996.20 cm–1 were found as IR active mode, but Raman inactive.
On the other hand the IR inactive modes at 604.30, 1034.48, and 1628.71
cm–1 for FNNF torsion, symmetric stretching of NF
and stretching vibration of N=N were found as Raman active
mode in trans-DFDZ (Figure 15b).

The different vibrational modes
of cis-DFDZ at
330.82 (A1), 556.26 (A2), 740.60 (B2), 910.57 (A1), 946.61 (B2), and
1643.26 (A1) cm–1 are also close to the experimental
work,82 for example, 332 (A1), 546 (A2),
731 (B2), 897 (A1), 957 (B2), and 1492 (A1) cm–1. In cis-DFDZ, all of the vibrations were found
as IR active except out-of-plane of FNN at 556.26 cm–1, which is Raman active however appears as very weak peak (Figure 15c).

The other
five peaks at 1643.27 (str N=N), 946.61 (oop N=N),
910.57(sym str NF), 740.60 (asym str NF), and 330.82 (oop FNN) cm–1, respectively, are both the IR and Raman active (Figure 15d).

The resulting
vibrational frequencies for the optimized geometries
and predicted vibrational assignments of the fundamental modes of
both the trans- and cis-AzoFL along
with the theoretically calculated harmonic vibrational frequencies,
IR intensities, Raman scattering activities, and normal mode of vibrations
are given in Tables 11 and 12, respectively, using B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)
basis set at DFT level of theory. Some of the vibrational modes of
both the trans- and cis-AzoFL are
shown in Figures S7 and S8. In aromatic
cyclic compounds, almost all of the modes are delocalized over the
whole molecule;83 hence, assignments of
several vibrational modes are very difficult. However, the assignment
of the calculated frequencies is aided by the animation option of
Gauss View 6 graphical interface for Gaussian program, which gives
a visual presentation of the shape of the vibrational modes.

The model compound AzoFL has 46 atoms; hence, there are 138 motions,
3 of which are translational, 3 of which are rotational, and 132 (τ3N-6′) of which are vibrational modes. The azo
compound AzoFL belongs to C2 point group symmetry. Sixty-six
vibrational modes are IR active and 66 modes are IR inactive. All
of the IR inactive modes are found as Raman active modes.

The
theoretically predicted IR and Raman scattering activity spectra
by using B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) basis set at DFT level of theory for both
the trans- and cis-AzoFL with the
FL are shown in Figures 16 and 17 by using B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)
basis set at DFT level of theory.

2.4.3 N=N
Vibration
The stretching
vibrations of azo N=N unit is usually observed11,73 around at 1556–1420 cm–1. The nature of
the compound is very important in analyzing spectra of azo compounds.
The stretching vibration of N=N is found to vary for the different-nitrogen
containing compounds. The N=N stretching vibration of a symmetrical trans-azo compound is forbidden in the IR due to no change
in the dipole moment. Thus, the identification of this vibration and
to distinguish between the cis- and trans-isomers is somewhat problematic
due to its weakness or absence in the IR. Hence, the IR spectrum alone
is not straightforward to analyze for such type of compounds. The trans-DZ at 1659 cm–1 for N=N stretching
vibration shows zero intensity in IR but is Raman scattering active.
However, the cis-azo (N=N) compounds due to
nonzero dipole moment is expected to show active IR bands. The calculated
N=N stretching vibrations at 1658.61, 1653.34, 1613.87, 1529.83,
1513.48, and 1497.01 cm–1 is found with zero intensity
for the trans-AzoFL in the present work but are Raman
scattering active. Conjugation with FL ring lowers the frequency of
the N=N double bond in AzoFL. At the present study, the same
N=N stretching vibration was found at 1657.49, 1653.75, 1614.82,
and 1581.21 cm–1, respectively, for the cis-AzoFL. The parent cis-DZ due to its
isolated and stronger N=N double bond character shows IR band
at higher frequency at 1662 cm–1, which reflects
the 0.01 Å shorter bond length of cis-DZ compared
to cis-AzoFL. Minisini et al.84 found N=N stretching vibration at 1591 and 1544
cm–1 for cis-4-hydoxyazobenzene
and trans-4-hydoxyazobenzene, respectively, by DFT
calculation.

The N=N stretching frequency of cis-DFDZ at 1643.26 cm–1 shifted at 1628.78
cm–1 in trans-DFDZ, a 14.48 cm–1 shift to lower frequency is observed by Raman activity
spectrum. The N=N stretching frequency of cis-DZ at 1662.43 cm–1 shifted at 1659.03 cm–1 in trans-DZ, a 3.40 cm–1 shift
to lower frequency is observed by Raman activity spectrum. It should
be noted that though the cis-DZ has higher N=N
stretching vibration (1662.43 cm–1) compared to
that of cis-DFDZ (1643.26 cm–1),
the force constant is considerably lower (16.96 vs 22.28 mDyne/Å)
in cis-DZ (Tables 9 and 10). Similarly, even though
the trans-DZ has higher N=N stretching frequency
(1659.03 cm–1) compared to that of cis-and trans-DFDZ, its force constant was found as
lower value (9.86 mDyne/Å) by our B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) calculation
(Tables 9 and 10). Normally, bonds with stronger force constants
have higher vibrational frequencies; however, in this case, we have
observed the anomalies.

The in-plane vibration of N=N
was observed at 322.27, 366.62,
and 537.59 cm–1 as rocking mode with weak intensity
band in cis-AzoFL. The CNNC angle deformation was
found at 905.64 cm–1 as moderate weak band. The
out-of-plane vibration of N=N appeared at low frequency at
16.10, 196.72, and 915.04 cm–1 as wagging vibration
mode, whereas the 114.28, 481.22, 535.70, and 664.35 cm–1 bands appeared as twisting mode in cis-AzoFL.

The in-plane vibration of N=N appeared at 571.35 and 660.49
with moderate strong band but zero intensity in Raman activity scattering
spectrum for trans-AzoFL.

2.4.4 C–N
Vibration
The C–N
stretching bands generally appear around at 1000–1300 cm–1.65,85 The identification of this vibration
is somewhat difficult due to the mixing of vibrations in this region.
In trans-AzoFL, the asymmetric C–N vibrations
were found at 1231.20 and 1289.01 cm–1 as strong
band in IR which is Raman inactive, whereas the symmetric stretching
of C–N at 1264.60 cm–1 with zero intensity
is Raman scattering active.

Our calculated C–N vibration
mode in cis-AzoFL appeared at 1209.59, 1215.31, 1260.81,
and 1261.34 cm–1 as mixing mode with in-plane CH
vibration and CCC deformation. All of the modes are IR and Raman active.
The in-plane and out-of-plane bending vibrations assigned for AzoFL
are also presented in Tables 11 and 12.

2.4.5 Aromatic
C=C Vibrations
Ar(C=C) stretching
vibrations usually found at
1625–1430 cm–1.65,85 For the model trans-AzoFL, the calculated Ar(C=C) stretching vibration appears at 1502.90, 1513.48,
1520.07, 1604.96, 1613.87, and 1529.83 cm–1 together
with other modes. The vibrations at 1652.38 and 1655.07 cm–1 appear as a strong peak for Ar(C=C) stretching
vibration. The stretching vibration at 1625.72, 1653.34, and 1658.61
cm–1 for Ar(C=C) appears as zero
intensity in IR spectra but as strong peak in Raman activity spectrum.
The in-plane vibration of Ar(C=C) was observed at
513.35 and 547.75 cm–1 with zero intensity in IR
spectrum.

For the model cis-AzoFL, the calculated
Ar(C=C) stretching vibration appears at 1502.81,
1514.83, 1515.05, 1601.91, and 1614.82, cm–1 together
with the other mode. The vibrations at 1625.92 and 1626.08 and 1651.10
cm–1 appear as a strong peak for only Ar(C=C) stretching vibration.

For the parent fluorene (FL), the calculated
Ar(C=C) stretching vibration appears at 1623.76,
1628.97, 16.54.80, and
1654.87 cm–1. The calculated IR spectra of FL at
B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) are shown in Figure 17. The frequencies of different bonds, their
IR intensities, Raman scattering activities, and force constants are
listed in Table S4.

2.4.6 C–H Vibrations
The aromatic
C–H stretching typically exhibits65,85 several weak-to-moderate bands above 3000 cm–1. In trans-AzoFL, the four C–H bonds from
C9Hs and C9′Hs are stretches at 3033.36,
3033.37, 3062.81, and 3062.82 cm–1 as moderate strong
band. The two C–H bonds at C9 position stretches
both symmetrically and asymmetrically among themselves and with respect
to other fluorene ring C9′Hs as well. Among the
two symmetric modes for the two C–H bonds at C9 position,
one is asymmetric at 3033.36 cm–1 with respect to
other ring found as IR active. However, the other one at 3033.37 cm–1 that is symmetric with respect to other ring is found
as IR inactive but Raman active. The same trend is observed for the
asymmetric stretching vibration of the two C9–H
bonds. The stretching vibration of rest aromatic 14 C–H bonds
from two fluorenyl ring appeared together at 3174.85, 3174.87, 3181.31,
3181.32, 3184.62, 3184.72, 3192.56, 3194.96, 3195.04, 3204.19, 3204.26,
3226.84, and 3226.98 cm–1. Among those seven modes
are IR inactive but Raman active, while seven IR active modes are
Raman inactive. A similar spectral pattern was observed for the aromatic
C–H absorption band region. The entire vibration modes in this
region are found as both IR and Raman active with low intensity. The
two C–H bonds in C9 of fluorene appears at 3032.08
and 3060.75 cm–1 as doublet, one symmetric and the
other for asymmetric stretching, respectively. The calculated harmonic
frequencies for the AzoFL molecule are related to the gaseous phase,
but the reported values from experimental works are done in the solid
phase. Hence, a slight disagreement between the present calculated
and reported experimental frequencies can be expected. Aromatic C–H
in-plane bending vibrations usually occur in the region of 1390–990
cm–1 and are very useful for characterization and
identification of aromatic compounds, whereas C–H out-of-plane
deformations generally appears at 1000–700 cm–1.65,85 Both the in-plane and out-of-plane bending
vibrations within the fluorene ring and between the two fluorene ring
in different pattern for 18 C–H groups as scissoring, rocking,
twisting, and wagging mode were observed. The out–of plane
wagging vibration for aromatic ring C–H appeared at 754.23
cm–1 as a strong band together with fluorene ring
breathing at 754.67 cm–1 in parent FL. The same
wagging mode in trans-AzoFL shifted to 747.35 and
at 775.17 cm–1 in cis-AzoFL as
strong band. Though the C–H bonds in both the FL ring of cis-AzoFL vibrate in wagging mode, they twist as a net result
with respect to one another ring.

In cis-AzoFL,
the four C–H bonds from C9Hs and C9′Hs are stretches at 3033.87, 3033.89, 3063.31, and 3063.31 cm–1 as moderate strong band. The stretching vibration
of rest aromatic 14 C–H bonds from two fluorenyl ring appeared
together at 3174.81, 3174.83, 3181.12, 3181.12, 3186.67, 3186.82,
3190.95, 3190.97, 3192.37, 3192.40, 3204.14, 3204.20, 3215.99, and
3216.10 cm–1. The C–H bonds at different
positions stretch both symmetrically and asymmetrically among themselves
within the ring and with respect to other fluorene ring as well. Unlike
the trans-AzoFl, the vibrational frequencies of C–H
bonds of cis-AzoFl are found as both the IR and Raman
scattering active. All of the vibrational modes of cis-AzoFL for the different C–H bonds, their IR intensities,
Raman scattering activities, and force constants are listed in Table 12. All of the frequencies
were found to be well matched within the characteristics region and
the details are presented in Tables 11 and 12 for both the isomers.

In FL, the two C–H bonds from C9Hs stretch symmetrically
and asymmetrically at 3032.08 and 3060.75 cm–1 as
moderate strong band, respectively. The stretching vibrations from
other C–H bonds are observed at 3173.37, 3173.71, 3179.55,
3181.13, 3190.85, 3192.06, 3203.15, and 3203.80 cm–1, respectively.

2.4.7 Ring Vibration
The fluorenyl ring
breathing vibration at 759.94 cm–1 in cis-AzoFL matches nicely with the literature value.86 The breathing mode at 758.63 cm–1 in trans-AzoFL is IR inactive but Raman scattering active mode.
The breathing mode in parent fluorene ring appears at 754.67 cm–1 (Figure 17) as a very weak peak in our present work.

Overall,
the present computations show that both the trans- and cis-isomers
possess different vibrational frequencies for the same structural
−N=N– unit; hence, both the isomers were characterized
and distinguished. The isolated N=N stretching vibration of trans-diazene appears at 1659.03 cm–1 in
Raman scattering spectra whereas the same vibration mode appears at
1662.43 cm–1 for cis-diazene in
both the IR and Raman scattering spectra. The N=N group in
both the trans and cis-DFDZ vibrates
at ∼30 and ∼19 cm–1 lower frequency
at 1628.71 and 1643.27 cm–1, respectively, compared
to that of respective DZ. We can safely conclude that the isolated
N=N stretching vibration in the presence of substituents shifts
toward the shorter wavelength in symmetrically disubstituted azo compounds.
For cis-diazene, both the asymmetric and symmetric
stretching vibration bands at 3088.26 and 3185.08 cm–1 were observed for the two N–H groups in IR and Raman scattering
spectra, whereas for trans-isomer only one, the asymmetric stretching
vibration band at 3313 cm–1 was found as IR active
and the other one, symmetric vibration at 3280 cm–1 was Raman scattering active. The same trend was observed for difluorodiazene,
for example, two absorption bands of the two N–F groups, asymmetric
and symmetric absorption bands at 740.60 and 910.57 cm–1, were observed both in the IR and Raman scattering spectra for cis-DFDZ. The asymmetric stretching vibration band of N–F
bonds at 996.45 cm–1 was found as IR active and
on the other hand, symmetric vibration at 1034.89 cm–1 was found as Raman scattering active for trans-DFDZ.
Similar patterns were observed for the model compound trans- and cis-AzoFL. Among different bands of stretching
vibration, the two asymmetric stretching vibrations at 1289.01 and
1231.20 cm–1 for C–N bond are IR active,
whereas the band is found as inactive mode in Raman scattering spectra.
The IR inactive mode of symmetric stretching vibration at 1264 and
1209.63 cm–1 for the same C–N bond are found
as Raman active mode.

3 Conclusions
In order to gain insight into the azo −N=N–
backbone, studies on the molecular geometry, vibrational frequencies,
infrared intensities, force constants, and Raman scattering activities
were carried out at the DFT with B3LYP functional using 6-31+G(d,p)
basis set for trans- and cis-bis(9H-fluoren-2-yl)diazene (AzoFL). The work has been extended
with the π-conjugation spacer fluorene, the parent trans-/cis-diazene and difluorodiazene by the same method
(DFT) and same basis set 6-31+G(d,p). The influences of substituents
on the azo −N=N– backbone of parent trans- and cis-diazene by using (i) electron rich π-bonded
aromatic fluorene rings and (ii) electron-rich lone pairs of F atoms
having electron withdrawing nature, for example, in model AzoFL and
difluorodiazene were observed. Introducing fluorene ring into the
−N=N– backbone causes an increase of the N=N
bond length due to the extensive π-bond conjugation in AzoFL.
The longer bond length reflects on the stretching vibration of AzoFl.
Both the trans- and cis-AzoFL vibrates
at a much lower frequency compared to that of parent trans- and cis-diazene. A reverse trend (shorter −N=N–
bond length) is observed by introducing F atoms into the −N=N–
backbone. Though it is expected that compounds having shorter bond
length should vibrate at higher frequency but unexpectedly both the trans- and cis-difluorodiazene vibrates
at lower frequency compared to that of parent diazene. It should be
noted that though the trans-AzoFL is stable by 16.33
kcal/mol than the cis-AzoFL, the trans-DFDZ is less stable than its cis-counterpart.

To study the electronic properties, viz. UV–vis spectra,
excitation energies and the maximum absorption wavelength, oscillator
strength, energies of HOMO, LUMO, and energy difference between them, Eg (HOMO–LUMO), electronic transitions,
and transition probabilities for the model trans-
and cis-AzoFL by TD-DFT calculation using B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)
starting from the initial optimized geometry by DFT-B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)
in gas phase were performed. Both the UV–vis spectral and vibrational
analyses show a substantial influence on the −N=N–
backbone and a significant variation were observed. Critical comparisons
were carried out with the above-mentioned compounds using TD-DFT and
ZIndo method.

Compared to parent trans-diazene
(λmax 178.97 nm), a significant variation to longer
wavelength
(∼245 nm) is observed due to incorporation of the fluorene
(FL) ring into the −N=N– backbone. The co-planarity
of the two FL ring with the longer N=N bond length compared
to the unsubstituted parent diazene indicates the effective red shift
due to the extended π-conjugation in trans-AzoFL.
The nonplanarity of cis-AzoFL (48.1° tilted
about the C–N bond relative to the planar N=N–C
bond) reflects its ∼64 nm blue shift compared to that of trans-counterpart.
However, two F atoms into the backbone of −N=N–
causes only ∼10 nm red shift in trans-DFDZ
but ∼15 nm opposite blue shift in cis-DFDZ
respectively for π–π* transition band compared
to that of trans- and cis-diazene.

The same trend is observed for n−π* transition as
well, that is, the n−π* band shifts to longer wavelength
(λmax 517.82 nm) in cis-AzoFL, on
the other hand the same band shifts to shorter wavelength (λmax ≈ 190 nm) in cis-DFDZ compared
to that of parent cis-diazene (λmax 371.78 nm). Present calculation shows that the ZIndo method is reasonably
good to explain the absorption behavior of the cis-/trans-isomers
of studied azo compounds.

These findings can provide the basic
understanding on the electronic
properties of geometric cis–trans azo isomers. The opposite absorption behavior between AzoFL and
DFDZ clearly imply that the aromatic fluorene (FL) ring and fluorine
atoms (F) as substituents on the azo −N=N– backbone
play a vital role among the different pair of cis–trans azo compounds under study. Because
all of the calculations were performed in the same platform, it allowed
us to compare and investigate the behaviors of the azo compounds more
accurately. Isac and co-workers87 observed
charge-transfer transitions in azobenzene when substituted with maleimide
functional group. Compared to azobenzene, our model azofluorene compounds
have extended π-conjugation framework and thus might have the
possibility to play a potential role in such type of charge transfer
transitions. We believe that the findings of the present work are
of substantial interest in the field of optoelectronic properties
of π-conjugated azo polymers.

4 Computational
Methods
The ground-state geometries of six azo compounds,
viz., trans-
and cis-isomers of diazene (DZ), difluorodiazene (DFDZ), our model
compound bis(9H-fluoren-2-yl)diazene (AzoFL) respectively,
and the π-conjugation spacer, fluorene (FL) were calculated
at the DFT level of theory. The B3LYP hybrid functional88,89 using 6-31+G(d,p) basis set was employed to perform the calculations
in gas phase for all of the above-mentioned compounds in neutral state.
The geometries for all of the DFT calculations were initially optimized
at the semi-empirical AM190 level. The
resulting geometry is then employed as starting geometry for optimization
at the DFT/B3LYP level of theory for better description. Geometry
optimization by ab initio Hartree–Fock calculations were also
performed using HF/6-31+G(d,p), HF/6-31++G(d,p), and HF/6-311+G(d,p)
basis set for DZ and DFDZ. Bernys optimization algorithm91 was used to run the complete geometry optimization
for both the trans- and cis-AzoFL
and all other above-mentioned compounds. The optimized structural
parameters of DFT calculations and all other calculations at the same
level of theory and basis set were used in the vibrational frequency
calculations. Vibrational frequency calculations were performed with
high degree of accuracy, and no imaginary frequencies were found.
Hence, true minimum on the potential energy surface were obtained
in each case. The unscaled calculated harmonic frequencies, force
constants, infrared intensities, and Raman scattering activities were
obtained from the output result of the frequency calculations.

The GaussView program92 which is a graphical
user interface designed to be used with Gaussian,93 has been used to predict the vibrational modes, intensities,
and spectra by visual animation for the verification of the normal
mode assignments. The defined coordinates form a complete set and
match quite well with the motions observed using the gauss view 6.0.16
program. Density functional time-dependent, TD/DFT94−97 excited-state calculations with
the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) basis set based on the optimized geometries
of B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) were carried out on the three lowest spin allowed
singlet–singlet transitions for the model compound AzoFL, other
mentioned azo compounds and FL in the gas phase to get the excitation
energies, UV–vis absorption maximum wavelengths (λmax), oscillator strength (f) and UV–vis
absorption spectra, HOMO, LUMO energies, and the FMO orbitals. Based
on the optimized geometry from AM1, ZIndo98−100 calculations
were performed in similar fashion. All of the calculations mentioned
above were performed by Gaussian 1693 and
Gauss View 6.0.1692 program package by
intel core i3-6006U CPU@2.00 GHz, 1.99 GHz on note book computer by
windows version 10.
