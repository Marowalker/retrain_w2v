Pt/Ca2+–polyethylene oxide/polymer poly[3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl]/Pt
devices were fabricated, and their pulse responses were studied. The
discharging peak, represented by the postsynaptic current (PSC), first
increases and then decreases with increasing input number in a pulse
train. The weight of the PSC decreased for low-frequency stimulations
but increased for high-frequency stimulations. However, the peak of
the negative differential resistance during the charging process varied
following the opposite trend. These behaviors suggested the ability
for transferring the signal bidirectionally, confirming the equivalence
between the ionic kinetics of our device and the transmitter kinetics
of one kind of synapse. A facilitation
(F)–depression (D) interplay
model corresponding to the ionic polarization and doping interplay
at the electrolyte/semiconducting polymer interface was adopted to
successfully mimic the weight modification of the PSC. The simulation
results showed that the observed synaptic plasticity was caused by
the great disparity between the recovery time constants of F and D (τF and τD). Moreover, such
an interplay could inspire the features of responses to post-tetanic
stimulations. Our study suggested a means to realize synaptic computation.

1 Introduction
Until
now, a lot of efforts have focused on finding artificial
materials to realize the functions of synapses and neurons,1−4 which could be used as elements to create neuromorphic networks
and brainlike computations.5 Such endeavors
started long ago to explore the mysteries of signal handling and memory
of the neural system.6,7 Spikes resembling action potentials
were generated, followed by electrical injection using polyelectrolyte
membranes without lipids.6 Lipid membranes
acting as a carrier for signal propagation have also been studied
thoroughly.7 Recently, many studies have
found that systems containing salt-doped organic electrolyte/semiconducting
polymers behave rather similar to biological synapses. Ionic migration
at the interface plays a critical role in modulating the signal strength
and plasticity. In particular, frequency selectivity was first discovered
in Pt/polyethylene oxide (PEO) + Li+/poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl)
(P3HT)/Pt device, for which the system responded in depression at
a low-frequency stimulation (LFS) but responded in potentiation at
a high-frequency stimulation (HFS).8,9 When the semiconducting
layer was changed to modulate the de-doping rate of ions, the frequency
selectivity became long-term reserved, exhibiting spike-rate-dependent
plasticity (SRDP).10 Moreover, the threshold
of depression–potentiation in the frequency selectivity exhibited
a sliding behavior11 which is consistent
with the BCM (Bienenstock, Cooper, and Munro) learning rule to solve
the problem of stability and adaptivity.12,13 In addition, the monotonous plasticity or the simple Hebbian learning
rule could simply be simulated by the pulse response of a salt-doped
electrolyte.14 Therefore, these studies
suggest that the ionic kinetics in salt-doped electrolyte/semiconducting
polymer systems could act as prototypes for simulating the ionic flux
and transmitter release of neural systems. It is important for us
to recognize the intrinsic mechanism of such ionic kinetics.

As known from neuroscience, short-term plasticity (STP) is regarded
to be critical in signal handling.15,16 The messengers,
also known as neural transmitters, are subjected to the interplay
between facilitation and refractory depression effects, which is the
stem of diversity of plasticity.15,17−19 The former is caused by the calcium-dependent release probability,
and the latter is the result of release sites becoming ineffective
after release. The microscopic mechanisms and kinetics of facilitation
and depression could vary because of the variety of structures of
neurons and synapses. With the models available, the physicochemical
mechanism to simulate the corresponding plasticity can be found. For
example, a salt-doped electrolyte device could be used to simulate
a monotonous plasticity (potentiation or depression), in which the
transmitter release ability is either high or low,16,17,20,21 and the recovery
of the electric natural region or the enhanced ionic polar region
corresponds to either a facilitation (F) or a depression
(D) process.14 However,
it is hard to use such a simple structural model to simulate a more
complex plasticity such as frequency selectivity because neither F nor D can predominate over the whole
period of external stimulation.

The introduction of an electrolyte/semiconductor
interface plays
an important role in modulating the ionic kinetics and provides an
opportunity to simulate a more complex plasticity. In these devices,
ionic doping into the semiconductor layer occurs during pulse stimulation,
and de-doping occurs in the interval between two pulses, which overlap
with each other both temporally and spatially. The frequency selectivity
in Pt/Li+–PEO/P3HT/Pt devices can be explained from
the phenology point of view,8 and a structural
model can be established to demonstrate the mechanism of SRDP.9,10 Because the modifications of the structure or the conformation at
the electrolyte/semiconductor interface cannot be obtained during
pulse stimulation, only the ionic kinetics of the salt-doped electrolyte
and the corresponding pulse responses can be simulated on the level
of molecular dynamics.22 However, interactions
between ionic accumulation and doping at the interface naturally exist
in both the temporal and spatial scale, which should be the critical
factors for frequency selectivity generation. This leads us to consider
the kinetic model of the interplay between F and D known in neuroscience and the contribution of the interplay
to the pulse responses.17

In this
work, we studied the pulse responses and plasticity of
Pt/Ca(CF3SO3)2-doped PEO/P3HT/Pt
devices, finding that they behaved equivalently to the Schaffer collateral
(SC) synapses of rat brains.17 Thus, the
interplay model of F and D in neuroscience
was adopted to simulate weight modifications,17 in which the F and D components
would correspond to the increase and decrease of Ca2+ ions
accumulated or ionic polarization and doping at the PEO/P3HT interface.
In addition, we demonstrated that the model can be extended to other
complex plasticities, for example, weight modification due to post-tetanic
stimulation.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Electrical Properties and Facilitation–Depression
Combined Short-Term Plasticity
Figure 1a,b shows the device structure with EO/Ca2+ molar ratio of 32:1, and Figure 1c,d shows direct current–voltage (dc I–V) characteristics. The structural
results from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra indicate that the
P3HT crystallites were not detected, and the electrolyte consisted
of the crystallized PEO and the amorphous PEO–salt complex
in the PEO–Ca2+/P3HT (EO/Ca2+ = 32:1)
device (Figure S1). The Ca2+ transport channels mainly existed in the amorphous region, which
was surrounded by crystalline lamellae. The Raman results indicate
that the initial state of P3HT is not doped by the salt (Figure S2) but might enhance the diffusion probability
of ions into the P3HT layer.

(dc I–V) characteristics.
(a) Device
configuration. (b) SEM cross-sectional image of the device, showing
that the thickness of the PEO complex is approximately 20 μm.
(c,d) I–V properties obtained
by using a sweeping prototype at a rate of 100 V/s in the voltage
range of (c) 0–2 V and (d) 0 to −2 V. Five sweeping
cycles were applied.

The sweeping rate used to measure the I–V characteristics was 100 V/s. Hysteresis loops appeared
because of ion migration and the formation of an electric double layer
of the PEO electrolyte. When a P3HT layer was introduced, the I–V characteristics showed a rectification
behavior and a negative differential resistance (NDR) effect under
a positive bias, as shown in Figure 1c. Because the I–V curves of the PEO complex single-layer device exhibited a symmetric
shape and no NDR effect (Figure S3), this
phenomenon is attributed to the p-type P3HT, owing to its π-electron-rich
property. When a positive bias was applied, the electrostatic induction
of π-electrons appeared because of an accumulation of Ca2+ ions at the PEO/P3HT interface.23 This generated an additional electric field that produced a reduction
in the offset potential (Figure 1b), which caused an evident decrease in the current
and an NDR effect. However, when a negative bias was applied, the
π-electrons of P3HT could not cause significant polarization
with the CF3SO3– ions. Thus,
the migration of ions hardly meets any obstacles, and no NDR effect
appeared. Besides, the current values in the negative sweeping direction
are higher than those in the positive sweeping direction, suggesting
a rectification effect in the device. We also examined the resistance
of the P3HT film (Figure S4) and confirmed
that it contributed less to the whole resistance value and that the
interface effect is the origin of the rectification, which could be
reflected in the impedance spectra (Figure S5).

To further investigate the response of these devices, we
looked
at the response to trains of triangular pulses with an amplitude of
0.7 V, a loading rate of 100 V/s, a pulse number of 200, and a frequency
range of 1–125 Hz. The discharging peak after each pulse can
be identified as the postsynaptic current (PSC) adopted in the neuroscience.8,10,13,24 The ratio between the Nth pulse and the first pulse
in a series of PSCs was defined as the synaptic weight (W = PSCN/PSC1). The variation
of W with the input number at different frequencies
is shown in Figure 2a. In our experiment, the weight modification at 1 Hz was set as
baseline (W = 100%) because the PSC did not vary
at that frequency. As shown in Figure 2a, when the input frequency was between 10 and 20 Hz,
the weight of the PSC decreased to a stable value with a time constant
of seconds. When the input frequency was increased further to relatively
high values (approximately 50 Hz), the PSC showed a discernible increase
in the first several pulses and then decreased, showing a synaptic
weight lower than 100% at the end of the pulse train. When the input
frequency was very high, that is, 125 Hz, the PSC rose to a high value,
with a weight of 116% (facilitation period) and then gradually decreased
to a value of approximately 113% (depression period). Such a facilitation–depression
transition is equivalent to the short-term plasticity of SC synapses
of the rat brain (inset in Figure 2a), combining both facilitation and depression on a
different time scale.17

Figure 2 Variations in the pulse
responses with pulse number and frequency.
The train of triangular pulses was added on the device with a pulse
amplitude of 0.7 V, a loading rate of 100 V/s, and a pulse number
of 200. (a) Weight variations with the pulse number at different frequencies.

the discharging peaks, whereas the red-square line represents that
of the NDR peaks. Inset: Weight modifications of the SC synapse vs

processes (0.4–0.7 V) with the pulse number (from 10 to 190)
under (c) 40 Hz and (d) 80 Hz stimulations, respectively. The black
lines represent the trend of the NDR voltage (VNDR) with the pulse number. The color maps represent the current
values at the NDR peaks.

The weight modification with respect to the input frequency
is
plotted in Figure 2b by using the PSC values of the 200th pulse responses (black-dot
line). These results show that the PSC facilitated at high rates but
depressed during lower stimulation rates. Moreover, the W–f function of the Ca–PEO/P3HT device
is consistent with those of Li–PEO/P3HT and Mg–PEO/P3HT
devices, which depressed at LFS and facilitated at HFS.8,25,26 Such frequency selectivity was
first proposed by the CLO (Cooper, Liberman, and Oja) learning rule
to provide a selective response to various signals,12,27 which shows that the difference among ion–molecule interactions
should be intrinsic, supporting signal selectivity and computation.15 The composition of EO/Ca2+ = 32:1
that we chose is a conventional ratio, as we used in our previous
studies. Here, we have examined the XRD patterns for the samples with
EO/Ca2+ = 32:1 and 16:1 in Figure S1. We found that when EO/Ca2+ is larger than 24:1, the
device would exhibit frequency selectivity; otherwise, the synaptic
weight could only monotonically increase with the frequency. All electrical
experiments were performed at room temperature. The ionic conductivity
of the PEO–salt complex will significantly decrease as the
temperature drops. However, when the temperature rises, the PEO layer
may turn to a viscous state.

According to the results of doping
several types of ions, we find
that usually the depression values under low frequencies are moderate
around 1–10%, but the potentiation values under high frequencies
varied greatly with the type of ions up to 150%.8−10,26 Apparently, the type of ions is one of the most important
factors influencing the value of weight modification. The atomic mass
of Ca ion is larger than those of Li and Mg ions so that the migration
rate of Ca2+ is lower than those of Li+ and
Mg2+.8,26 This may be a reason that the
absolute weight values are low in this work. Considering that a synapse
system comprises several types of ions, we guess that the difference
in the weight value induced by the type of ions could be one element
for computing in a neuromorphic network. Therefore, if we need a large
value of weight modification, we could choose the ions with a small
atomic mass. We are finding methods to distinguish factors influencing
the weight value quantitatively, especially solve the relationship
between the weight value and the ion mass.

The charging process
was also considered, showing that the largest
charging current, that is, the value of the NDR peak, decreased first
at low input rates and then increased at higher input rates, which
is in contrast to the PSC behavior during the discharging process.
This could be seen when the weight modifications of the NDR peaks
versus frequency were calculated, as shown by the red-dot line in Figure 2b. Such plasticity
of the charging process can be demonstrated in detail by using the
pulse responses to stimulations at 40 and 80 Hz. The current of the
charging process (0.4–0.7 V) during each pulse in the depression
stage (N = 10–190) is shown in Figure 2c,d. As the number of pulses
increases, the current and bias of the NDR peak also increase, suggesting
a nonlinear variation in the electrical resistance, similar to the
one seen in memristor devices.2,28,29 The weight represented by the NDR peak leads to an opposite selectivity
of pulse frequency, shown by the red dots in Figure 2b, and coincides with the W–f variation of SC synapses (inset in Figure 2b). This phenomenon
has also been observed in Mg–PEO/P3HT devices.26 Thus, the system displays the potential for bidirectional
signal transfer. This feature is not attended in either organic electronics
or ionics and is only observed in the system doped by the binary valence
ions according to our recent studies.8,10,14,25,26,29 Therefore, these results suggest
that the size, valence state, and atomic mass of ions would become
the gist of signal selectivity.

Recent studies reported mimicking
SRDP by using memristors.30−33 Compared with them, we are focusing on the role of
ionic kinetics
on the synaptic plasticity and similarity of the materials and device to the
behavior of the biosynapse. Until now, the inorganic memristors exhibit
a stronger potential in massive fabrication because of stability and
a compatible technique with integration circuits.30,32,33 The weight variations in the charging and
discharging process suggest that our system is usable for bidirectional
interplay and signal transfer from the view of electronics. This is
different from those studies where a synaptic device shows potentiation
and depression under different voltage stimuli.30−33 Bidirectional transfer has been
suggested early in Hebbian proposal.12,34 However, we
are not sure that our results are consistent with those observed in
biology and neuroscience, for example, back propagation from axon
to dendrite.35 The physical mechanism in
the phenomenon needs to be studied in depth. Anyway, it is possible
to return the state of the post neuron at the same time sending out
the signal using our system.

The results in Figure 2 also suggest that there should be a mechanism in the device
that allows facilitation at the beginning but later depresses the
pulse train (Figure 2a). Figure 3 illustrates the
diverse plasticity and its intrinsic ionic kinetics. During the first
several pulses, the polarization of ions under an external bias and
the induction between Ca2+ ions and π-electrons in
P3HT strengthened the internal electric field, resulting in a fast
facilitation process of a discharging current peak. After that, the
weight decreased on a longer time scale, which could be attributed
to the electrostatic-like doping process of the Ca2+ ions
moving from the upper layer to the P3HT layer. The Ca2+ ions accumulated at the interface during the polarization process
would be reduced by the electrostatic-like doping process, leading
to a reduction in the interfacial inverse field and weakening the
strength of the discharging peak. The doping process only occurs in
the area under the island electrode, so that during the pulse intervals,
locally doped Ca2+ ions decay and diffusion arises, as
in the de-doping process. Usually, the electrochemical doping process
between the P3HT and PEO electrolytes is slower than the response
time of polarization of the polymer dielectric, which is due to the
interface barrier and the much slower ionic mobility in the semiconducting
polymer compared to that of PEO.23,37 This is the
reason the depression stage lasts much longer than the facilitation
stage, as shown in Figure 2a. However, the PEO complex single-layer device simply showed
facilitation plasticity under the same pulsed loads (section S2, Figure S6) because
of the lack of doping from the upper layer to the P3HT layer.

Figure 3 Internal ion
dynamics at different periods of the pulse train.
(a) PSC weight modification of 50 Hz pulses stimulation and (b) response
current of the 1st, 5th, and 200th pulse. The insets show the ion
distribution corresponding to each pulse. The discharging current
peak increased by the polarization of ions when the 5th pulse loaded
and decreased by the doping of Ca2+ when the 200th pulse
loaded.

Because the working currents are
in the level of microamperes in
most organic electronic experiments, we did not obtain the measurement
platforms avoiding vibration. However, the pulse responses of our
devices are more sensitive to the vibration because the current is
lower than the level of μA, so that we can perform the experiment
in an open environment. In such case, both humidity and temperature
influence the experimental results. We found previously that our samples
could maintain selectivity at least for a week if only we placed them
in the open environment during the experiment but failed after long-term
exposure to air.10 The difference in the carrier migration
ability of PEO/P3HT system in vacuum and in air was studied in a previous
publication.36 The ionic conductivity of
the PEO-based electrolyte was greatly increased upon hydration. Thus,
when exposed to an open environment, ions had larger mobility to migrate
from the PEO electrolyte layer to the semiconducting polymer layer.
We suppose that operating in an open environment or higher humidity
would strengthen the depression factor because the latter was attributed
to the ionic doping process (discussed in Figure 3 and the following text). In the aspect of
temperature, we suppose that a lower temperature will reduce the ionic
mobility and doping level, and the depression factor would be weakened.
The situation would be complicated if the temperature was enhanced.
The heating effect of the current would induce local fusion of PEO.
Both the influence of humidity and temperature needs to be verified
in a platform precisely controlling the two factors.

The results
in Figure 3 clearly
demonstrate that the ionic polarization and doping
interplay with each other at the interface, corresponding to the facilitation–depression
interplay in neural synapses.17,38 This is the intrinsic
reason for the analogies between the pulse response of our devices
and SC synapses. A model in neuroscience has been developed to describe
the incorporating mechanism of different short-term types of plasticity:
depression, facilitation, and both depression and facilitation dominating
synapses. The release value can be calculated as the product of the
facilitation component (F) and the depression component
(D), which are determined by the specific binding
of release sites and residual presynaptic calcium.17 Both F and D decay for
a constant time after the saltation, owing to an action potential,
and finally stabilize at a constant value after several stimuli at
a fixed frequency. Our previous study verified that the charging/discharging
processes of the salt-doped PEO electrolyte correspond to the effective
release sites of the transmitter and the Ca2+ flux in biological
synapses if either F or D dominate.14 The key factor that influences the short-term
plasticity is the elevation of residual presynaptic calcium (Cares). For all of these three different synapses, the release
value is the product of the facilitation component (F) and the depression component (D), which are determined
by the specific binding of the release sites and Cares.
Thus, the kinetic model describing the F–D interplay can be used to describe the pulse responses
of our artificial devices, being able to simulate the short-term plasticity
of two types of conventional synapses, that is, climbing fiber synapse
(depression plasticity), parallel fiber synapse (facilitation plasticity),
and SC synapse (facilitation and depression combined plasticity).14,17

The electrolyte/semiconductor interface differentiates this
device
from salt-doped electrolyte devices, and it is a critical element
for frequency selectivity. Although the conformation or organization
modification cannot be achieved while ions are passing through the
interface, the system should be described using the facilitation–depression
interplay modulated by the electrolyte/semiconductor interface. Considering
the frequency selectivity, a similar but simpler quantitative model
of F and D was adopted, referred
to as temporal filtering.38−40 Using this model, the increase
and decrease in the Ca2+ ions accumulated at the PEO/P3HT
interface can be related to F and D, respectively. Through the simulation process, we could subtract
the kinetic parameters providing the base for the signal computation
and extend the model to other types of complex short-term synaptic
plasticity.

The amplitude of the PSC of each pulse is the product
of several
facilitation and depression components. The model we discuss here
contains a single F and a single D. Thus, the amplitude of the PSC, A, can be described
as 1  where F and D correspond to the facilitation and depression components, respectively.
The value of F is larger than 1, and the value of D is smaller than 1. After each pulse in a stimulation train, F increases by a value f and D decreases by a value d. 2  Assuming that in a single
test, f and d remain the same when
the pulse number increases,
both F and D converge exponentially
back to 1 in the stimulation interval, expressed as 3  Because of different time constants and varying
patterns of F and D, a single synapse
can present both facilitation and depression on different time scales.
In most cases, τD is larger than
τF, meaning that facilitation dominates
in the early stage of a train of pulses and depression dominates in
the later stage.

Under a positive bias, the internal electric
field increases by
the accumulation of Ca2+ ions at the interface and would
weaken by the electrochemical doping of Ca2+ ions from
PEO to P3HT. The larger internal field results in larger discharging
currents and accumulation of Ca2+ ions, which operate as
an electric double-layer capacitor and induce a facilitation component F. On the other hand, the dynamic doping process induces
a depression component D. To explain the different
plasticities corresponding to the different pulse intervals, we made
a small adjustment in the above biological model, defining the PSC
value as 4  where AN is the Nth PSC value, A0 is the assumed baseline current, and FN and DN are the values of the F and D components
after each stimulus, respectively. F and D evolve exponentially between two stimuli
according to eq 3, that
is, 5   6   7  where α and β are integration
coefficients, r is the pulse frequency, and λ
is the pulse width. Then, the recurrence relation between the components
of the Nth pulse and the (N –
1)th pulse can be defined as 8   9  Here, 10  

Assuming F0 = 1 and D0 = 1
the general terms of FN, DN, and AN can be obtained
as 11   12   13   14  All of the pulse
response data were fitted
using eq 14. The fitted
curves and the values of the parameters (τF, τD, α, β, f, and d) for each experiment can be seen
in Figure S3 and Table S1. For all simulations, the values of τF, τD, α,
and β are fixed at τF = 0.0115,
α = 0.5159, τD = 2.2632, and
β = 1. Figure 4a,b shows the fitting results for the pulse response to stimulations
at 40 and 80 Hz, respectively. Figure 4c shows the simulated values of F and D during the first 20 pulses for the stimulus trains of
40 and 80 Hz using the proposed model. F and D increased under bias and then exponentially decreased
to 1 at intervals with their respective time constants. In both stimulations, F reached a steady state very fast, indicating that the
accumulation of Ca2+ ions is nearly saturated after the
first few pulses, whereas the depression period, that is, the doping
process was much longer. Under 80 Hz stimulations, the value of F is larger, and the value of D is smaller
than that under 40 Hz stimulations, which is consistent with the weight
dependence of frequency, as a result of the frequency selectivity.

In biological synapses, facilitation is derived from an increase
in the release probability, caused by specific binding between the
residual presynaptic calcium and the release sites. On the other hand,
depression is the consequence of transient deactivation of the release
sites after being occupied by a calcium-bound molecule. In our double-layer
device, an increase in the Ca2+ ion accumulation at the
PEO/P3HT interface can take the role of residual presynaptic calcium
and determine the magnitude of the facilitation and depression components.
This intrinsic property, similar to real synapses, provides a possibility
to mimic synaptic plasticity by manipulating the internal molecular
dynamics. Besides, the associated components F and D can be treated as multiple state variables, which is a
concept also utilized in second-order memristors to realize several
synaptic learning rules.41

The combination
of F and D in
a single device also contributes to the frequency selectivity of the
device. As shown in Figure 2b, the device exhibits an inhibitory property (W < 1) under LFS (less than 80 Hz) and an excitatory property under
HFS (80–125 Hz). The origin of this phenomenon is related to
the great disparity between the magnitudes of τF and τD, making
the F and D components exhibit different
sensibilities to frequency. These results show that the above model
naturally leads to frequency selectivity abilities in both biological
synapses and in our device, which endows our device with the biolike
filter effect for signal processing of neuromorphic chips.38

2.2 Weight Modification of
Post-Tetanic Stimulation
Because the magnitudes of the time
constants of F and D differ greatly,
it is natural to engineer
the intervals of external pulses to find out more biolike behaviors.
Here, we use the post-tetanic stimulation of biological experiments
to demonstrate the memory effect in our device.16Figure 5a shows the simulated responses in two kinds of biosynapses and the
corresponding synaptic weights during and following HFS, as accomplished
by Zucker and Regehr.16 First, an input
at 0.5 Hz was loaded, where the amplitude of the PSC remained unchanged.
Then, the synapses were stimulated by a train of high-frequency pulses
(10 Hz, 10 s), the so-called tetanic stimulation, where the weight
changed bidirectionally based on the type of facilitation or depression
present. When returning to LFS, the plasticity of facilitation vanished
immediately, and the depression effect persisted for a couple of seconds
before gradually fading away. The change in synapse activity during
a train of stimuli can remain for a long time, which is an important
characteristic that allows synapses to have the ability to learn and
have memory.

The total post-tetanic plasticity of a realistic
synapse is usually the weighted combination of these several kinds.
We stimulated our device by using a complex train of pulses (triangular
pulses with an amplitude of 0.7 V and a loading rate of 100 V/s) consisting
of 1 Hz (20 pulses)-high frequency (200 pulses)-1 Hz (20 pulses),
to emulate pretetanic, tetanic, and post-tetanic stimulations, respectively. Figure 5b shows the response
current to these stimuli. During pretetanic stimulation, the synaptic
weight remained almost constant. When the tetanic stimulation was
started, the device exhibited fast facilitation and slow depression.
After HFS, the weight decayed to a depression state with a time constant
of several seconds, which is the result of the combination of a facilitation-dominated
synapse and a depression-dominated synapse, as shown in Figure 5a.

We fitted the measured
data presented in Figure 5b by using the previously discussed model.
When stimulations change from high frequency to 1 Hz, F quickly decays to 1 because τF ≪ 1. Thus, the post-tetanic synaptic weight mainly depends
on D as 15   16  The initial value used for D is D200, which corresponds to the last
PSC of the high-frequency stimulus. The general term then turns into 17   18  where N is the number of
post-tetanic pulses. The fitted curves are shown in Figure 4c. We assume that the pretetanic stimulation does not change
the synaptic weight; so, the plasticity during tetanus is suitable
for the model previously discussed. The fitting parameters are shown
in Table S2.

The fitting results
show that the intrinsic ionic kinetics substantially
contributes to synaptic plasticity on different time scales. Early
studies indicated that when the frequency changed, the pulse response
of an artificial synapse would change accordingly, having a stable
weight for each stage.42,43 Therefore, when the total plasticity
at a high frequency was in a facilitation state, the synaptic weight
after tetanus discontinuously jumped to a depression state. This characteristic,
based on multistate variables with different time constants, is worth
considering because it provides an innovative way of manipulating
synaptic plasticity, emulating filtering, or memorizing.

Figure 5 (a) Simulations of the responses to post-tetanic stimulation in
facilitation synapse and depression synapse.16 The pulse frequencies used are 0.5, 10, and 0.5 Hz. (b) Pulse responses
to a set of stimulations with frequency series of 1 Hz → tetanic
stimulations (80 Hz) → 1 Hz. The pulse numbers of the three
sections are 20, 200, and 20. We assumed that the response of 1 Hz
stimulation before the tetanus stimulus keeps constant. The response
of 80 Hz stimulation was fitted by the model, and the 1 Hz stimulation
was fitted using parameters deduced from the data of the tetanus stage.
(c) Post-tetanic plasticity under different frequencies of tetanic
stimulation. The measured and fitted data are shown as dots and lines,
respectively. (d) Weight of the first PSC during LFS after the tetanus

3 Conclusions
In summary, Pt/Ca2+–PEO/P3HT/Pt devices responded
to pulse stimulations analogously to biological SC synapses. The PSC
value first increased and then descended with increasing input number
in a pulse train. The weight of the PSC decreased at LFS but increased
at HFS. However, the NDR peak during the charging process exhibited
the opposite trend. These behaviors suggest that our device has the
ability to transfer signals bidirectionally, confirming the equivalence
between the ionic kinetics of our device and the transmitter kinetics
of the SC synapse. We adopted a facilitation–depression interplay
model, which corresponds to the ionic polarization and doping interplay
at the electrolyte/semiconducting polymer interface, to successfully
mimic the weight modification of the PSC of our device. We verified
that the great disparity observed between the recovery time constants
of the two components (τF and τD) accounted for the synaptic plasticity.
Moreover, we demonstrated that such an interplay was able to emulate
the features of the response to post-tetanic stimulation, as well
as that observed in neuroscience. Therefore, our study shows a great
opportunity regarding the combination of the physical basis of biological
synapses and the intrinsic ionic kinetics of artificial devices, enabling
a new method to simulate synapses for more efficient neuromorphic
computing.

4 Experimental Section
The conjugated
polymers P3HT (MW =
65 000 g mol–1, Beijing Sweet Technology
Co., Ltd.), PEO (MW = 100 000 g
mol–1, Sigma-Aldrich Co. Ltd.), and calcium trifluoromethane
sulfonate [Ca(CF3SO3)2, 98%, Sigma-Aldrich
Co. Ltd.] were used as purchased. P3HT was dissolved at a concentration
of 5 mg mL–1 in 2-dichlorobenzene. PEO was dissolved
at a concentration of 5 mg mL–1 in deionized water
containing Ca(CF3SO3)2 at different
molar ratios of 1:32 and zero, expressed as the ratio of Ca(CF3SO3)2 to the ethylene oxide (EO) monomer.
The solvents were fully dispersed by stirring on a magnetic hot plate
at 320 K for 12 h. Silicon substrates (1 × 1 cm2)
with a layer of Pt of thickness 100 nm were used as the bottom electrode
and cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with acetone, alcohol, and deionized
water in sequence.

The substrates were spin-coated with 2 μL
of the P3HT solution
at 500, 3000, and 1500 rpm for 10, 30, and 20 s, respectively. They
were subsequently dried on a hot plate, first at a temperature of
373 K (100 °C) for 1 h and then at a temperature of 393 K (120
°C) for 20 min. Next, 5 μL of the PEO–Ca(CF3SO3)2 solution was drop-cast on the
P3HT film and baked at 383 K for 20 min. The preparation of the films
was completed in a glove box filled with nitrogen. Finally, 70 nm-thick
Pt island electrodes with a diameter of 100 μm were deposited
on top of the films using electron beam evaporation.

Electrical
measurements were carried out on a semiconductor device
measurement platform (Agilent B1500A) containing an arbitrary function
generator (Agilent B1530). The electrical signal was captured using
probes placed on the top and bottom electrodes. Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a ZEISS EVO scanning electron
microscope. Raman spectra were obtained using an HR-800 Raman system
with a 633 nm HeNe laser and a resolution of 1 cm–1. XRD patterns for salt-doped PEO were obtained using a Rigaku Smartlab
apparatus with a resolution of 1°/min and a scanning range of
2θ = 15–25°. Finally, polarizing microscope images
were observed using a Leica DM2500 M polarizing microscope. XRD patterns
for P3HT films were obtained using a D8 Advance diffractometer under
θ–2θ out-of-plain scanning. The increment is 0.01°,
and the scanning speed is 0.03°/step. The result was collected
for 2θ ranging from 4 to 10°.
