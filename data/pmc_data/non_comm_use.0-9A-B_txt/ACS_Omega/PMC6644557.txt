A new series of heteroleptic complexes
of cobalt were synthesized
using aminoalkoxide and β-diketonate ligands. The complexes,
[Co(dmamp)(acac)]2 (3), [Co(dmamp)(tfac)]2 (4), [Co(dmamp)(hfac)]2 (5), [Co(dmamp)(tmhd)]2 (6), and [Co(dmamb)(tmhd)]2 (7), were prepared by two-step substitution
reactions and studied using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,
mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA). Complexes 3–7 displayed dimeric
molecular structures for all of the complexes with cobalt metal centers
interconnected by μ2-O bonding by the alkoxy oxygen
atom. TGA and a thermal study of the complexes displayed high volatilities
and stabilities for complexes 6 and 7, with
sublimation temperatures of 120 °C/0.5 Torr and 130 °C/0.5
Torr, respectively.

Introduction
Cobalt is attractive because of its wide
variety of applications,
such as catalysis,1 protective coatings,2 magnetic information storage,3 and sensor systems.4 In microelectronics,
the applications of cobalt/cobalt-based thin films include their use
as the lining material within interconnected trenches,5 metallic interconnections, ohmic contacts in silicon-based
devices,6 and as Schottky contacts in the
field of optoelectronics.7 Thin films of
cobalt and cobalt oxide are also useful as components of energy storage
devices, such as LiCoO2 in lithium-ion batteries.8 In the last decades, cobalt-based thin films
have gained a renewed interest in light of the discovery of giant
magnetoresistance9 and tunneling magnetoresistance10 in multilayer structures for devices using these
phenomena.

Many techniques have been used to deposit thin films
for these
applications. Among them, the most common methods are chemical vapor
deposition (CVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD) because of their
potential to produce highly conformal coatings. As electronic devices
become smaller and more complex, conformality has become a very important
requirement for the deposited thin films. For all of these applications
and for the deposition of quality thin films, we require precursors
with suitable properties, such as good volatility, thermal stability,
and chemical reactivity (leading to pure film deposition). The known
precursors of cobalt include dicobalt octacarbonyl,11 cobalt acetylacetonate,12 cobalt
bis(N,N′-diisopropylacetamidinate),13 cobalt bis(N,N-di-tert-butylacetamidinate),13b bis(cyclopentadienyl)cobalt,14 cyclopentadienyl cobalt dicarbonyl,1c,15 cobalt nitroso
tricarbonyl,16 cobalt hydride tris(trialkylphosphite),17 bis(N-tert-butyl-N′-ethylpropionamidinato) cobalt(II),18 bis(1,4-di-tert-butyl-1,3-diazadienyl)
cobalt,19 and cyclopentadienyl-cobalt(III)(diazabutadiene).20 The observed drawbacks of these precursors include
their slow evaporation kinetics, unwanted reactions in the vapor state,
film contamination with carbon, low thermal stability, and a high
deposition temperature. The design and synthesis of new metal precursors
are continuous processes because of the demand for better-performing
precursors under a variety of conditions.

Recently, several
works, including our own,21 showed the
importance of heteroleptic precursors with improved
properties. Most of the common precursors are homoleptic in nature,
where the identical ligands are bonded to the metal center. In contrast,
a heteroleptic precursor is a metal complex with distinct ligands
attached to the metal center. The published results indicate that
a heteroleptic precursor designed by a suitable ligand selection could
have several better properties than its parent homoleptic precursor.
Even though the selection of suitable ligands for heteroleptic metal
precursors is as challenging as designing a new ligand for homoleptic
precursors, the heteroleptic precursors are advantageous because of
the availability of several ligands and their complexes with known
properties to choose from.

Here, we demonstrate the synthesis
and characterization of new
heteroleptic cobalt precursors with a combination of aminoalkoxide
(1-dimethylamino-2-methyl-2-propoxide (dmamp) and 1-dimethylamino-2-methyl-2-butoxide
(dmamb)) and β-diketonate (2,2,6,6-tetramethylheptan-3,5-dionate
(tmhd), acetylacetonate (acac), 1,1,1-trifluoro-2,4-pentanedionate
(tfac), and 1,1,1,5,5,5-hexafluoro-2,4-pentanedionate (hfac)) ligands.
The complexes, [Co(dmamp)(acac)]2 (3), [Co(dmamp)(tfac)]2 (4), [Co(dmamp)(hfac)]2 (5), [Co(dmamp)(tmhd)]2 (6), and [Co(dmamb)(tmhd)]2 (7), were prepared by simple substitution reactions
using the corresponding ligands and cobalt(II) bis(bis(trimethylsilyl)amide)
[Co(btsa)2]. All of the complexes were characterized using
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), elemental analysis, thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA), and X-ray crystallography. The results demonstrate
excellent thermal stabilities and volatilities of these complexes,
especially 6 and 7, which displayed high
volatilities and stabilities.

Results and Discussion
New heteroleptic
cobalt complexes were prepared by controlled substitution
reactions, as illustrated in Scheme 1. First, the tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution containing
Co(btsa)2 was treated with an equivalent amount of an aminoalcohol
(dmampH or dmambH) at low temperature. The products, [Co(dmamp)(btsa)]2 (1) and [Co(dmamb)(btsa)]2 (2), were isolated by extracting with toluene. In the second
step, 1 reacted with β-diketones, such as acacH,
tfacH, hfacH, and tmhdH, and 2 reacted with tmhdH in
THF solutions at low temperature. The products, [Co(dmamp)(acac)]2 (3), [Co(dmamp)(tfac)]2 (4), [Co(dmamp)(hfac)]2 (5), [Co(dmamp)(tmhd)]2 (6), and [Co(dmamb)(tmhd)]2 (7), were isolated by extracting with hexane. All of the complexes
prepared in this work are highly soluble in common organic solvents,
such as toluene, hexane, THF, and ether. Additionally, they are quite
stable under inert conditions, such as a nitrogen atmosphere.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Complexes 1–7
X-ray-quality crystals of the
complexes were obtained from saturated
toluene (1) and hexane (3–7) solutions at −30 °C. The crystals of complex 7 exhibited thermal disorder in the β-diketonate (in 7) chain. Complex 1 crystallized in a monoclinic
space group, complexes 6 and 7 crystallized
in triclinic space groups, and complexes 3–5 crystalized in orthorhombic space groups (Table 1). All of the complexes formed
dimers with alkoxy oxygens bridging the two metal centers in the complexes
by μ2–O bonding. This is similar to the results
for previously reported group 2 metal complexes [M(aminoalkoxide)(btsa)]2 (M = Mg, Sr, and Ca) and [M(aminoalkoxide)(tmhd)]2 (M = Mg, Sr, Ca, and Ba).21d,21e In complex 1, each of the cobalt metal ions was bonded to one btsa ligand and
one dmamp ligand, exhibiting a tetrahedral geometry (Figure 1). The bond length between
cobalt and nitrogen of the btsa group is recorded as Co–N =
1.9514(13) Å in 1 (Table 2), which is slightly shorter than that previously
reported for [Co{(NtBu)3SMe}2] (1.9873 (11) Å and 1.9939(10) Å).22 Similarly, the Co–N bond between cobalt and the
dmamp nitrogen atom displayed a bond length of 2.1598(14) Å,
which is also shorter than the known Co–N bond lengths in [Co(acac)2(TMEDA)] and [Co(acac)2(DMAPH)]223 (2.227(5) Å and 2.252(2) Å, respectively).
The reaction of β-diketone with 1 and 2 substituted the remaining btsa ligand to afford complexes 3–7. The crystal structures of 3–6 displayed penta-coordinated metal centers
and trigonal bipyramidal structures. In complexes 3–7, as shown in Figures 2–6, the Co–O bond lengths
between the central cobalt ion and the oxygen of the β-diketonate
ligands were 2.0017(12), 2.015(3), 2.0187(15), 2.0048(11), and 1.996(7)
Å, respectively, which were again shorter than that for similar
β-diketonate complexes of cobalt (2.064(4) Å for [Co(acac)2(TMEDA)], 2.046(3) Å for [Co(acac)2(DMAPH)]2,23 2.034(3) Å for [Co(acac)2(py)2], and 2.036(12) Å for [Co(tmhd)2(py)2]).24 However,
the Co–O bond lengths for complexes 3–7 are longer than those in the Co(thd)3 complex
(1.869(2) Å)25 and in [Co(tBuNNCHCRO)2 (R = tBu, iPr, Me)]26 (average
Co–O bond length is 1.915(1) Å). An increase in the Co1–O1–Co1i bond angle and relative increase in the Co···Co
distances were observed between complex 1 and complexes 3–7 (Table 2). This is because the structure changes from a very
strained tetrahedral geometry for 1 to a more relaxed
and stable trigonal bipyramidal geometry for 3–7 by the substitution of the monodentate btsa with bidentate
tmhd ligands.

The FT-IR spectra of the compounds
confirmed the complex formation.
Strong peaks are observed at ν = 2950 cm–1 (1) and 2963 cm–1 (2) (Si–CH3 stretching vibrations) and at 1242 cm–1 (1 and 2) (Si–CH3 rocking vibration), confirming the presence of one btsa group
in the compounds. The reaction of 1 or 2 with the β-diketones removed the btsa groups and formed 3–7. The FT-IR spectra of complexes 3–7 displayed strong peaks at ν
= 1601, 1627, 1645, 1583, and 1584 cm–1, respectively,
corresponding to the C=O stretching in coordinated β-diketones.
The absence of btsa peaks confirmed the complete substitution of the
btsa groups by β-diketonate ligands. This is also confirmed
by the Co–O stretching observed at ν = 452, 455, 458,
474, and 476 cm–1 for complexes 3–7, respectively.27 The absence
of −OH stretching peaks in the FT-IR spectra indicates that
the complexes are free of any non-coordinated ligands. The elemental
analysis results for the complexes were comparable to the calculated
values, considering their sensitivity toward air and moisture.

The mass spectra of the complexes 1–7 displayed peaks at m/z = 554,
568, 432, 540, 648, 600, and 614, respectively, which correspond to
[{M(aminoalkoxide)(β-diketonate)}2-(aminoalkoxide)]+. These results confirmed that the complexes formed into dimer structures
and one aminoalkoxide ligand was easily separated from the complexes
due to their high air and moisture sensitivity during mass analyses.

TGA was performed for complexes 3–7 from room temperature to 800 °C (Figure 6). Samples for the analysis were prepared
inside an argon-filled glovebox, and data collection was performed
under a constant flow of nitrogen to minimize any air contact. The
TGA plots of complexes 3, 4, and 5 show sharp weight losses of 75, 85, and 90% from 110 to 260 °C
(for 3), 110 to 250 °C (for 4), and
110 to 220 °C (for 5), respectively. This indicates
the possible vaporization of part of the complex in those temperatures.
Further mass losses of 13, 6, and 9% and the final residues of 12,
4, and 6% were observed for 3, 4, and 5, respectively. The second step of the mass loss in the TGA
may be the evaporation of some of the fragments resulting from the
complex decomposition. In contrast, complexes 6 and 7 displayed clean, single-step TGA curves from 175 to 310
°C with mass losses of 94 and 96%, respectively. The presence
of the second step of mass losses for complexes 3–5 indicates a possible fragmentation of the samples, whereas
complexes 6 and 7 display excellent vaporization
and thermal characteristics (Figure 7).

(3), blue (4), pink (5), black
(6), and green (7).

The complexes were subjected to sublimation experiments under
a
reduced pressure (0.5 Torr) to better understand their volatile characteristics.
All of the complexes, except 6 and 7, remained
nonvolatile under those conditions (up to 150 °C/0.5 Torr). Complexes 6 and 7 sublimed at 120 and 130 °C, respectively,
with good yields. The sublimed parts of the complexes were further
characterized by FT-IR, elemental analysis, and mass spectroscopy
to confirm that there were no changes in the structural features and
that no decomposition occurred during the process. Complexes 3–5 remained nonvolatile in this process
and underwent partial decomposition during prolonged heating at elevated
temperatures for long period.

Our study reveals the possibility
of developing heteroleptic precursors
by selecting suitable ligands from a large pool of known ligands.
This work reaffirms the importance of heteroleptic complexes as metal
precursors because the proper combination of ligands yields better
properties than those of their parent homoleptic complexes. In particular,
complexes 6 ([Co(dmamp)(tmhd)]2) and 7 ([Co(dmamb)(tmhd)]2) displayed good characteristics
with the melting points of 131 and 113 °C, respectively, and
the sublimation temperatures of 120 °C/0.5 Torr and 130 °C/0.5
Torr, respectively. These melting temperatures are lower than those
of commercial tmhd precursors of cobalt, such as Co(tmhd)2 (143 °C) and Co(tmhd)3 (254 °C). This study
clearly demonstrates that well-designed heteroleptic metal precursors
can be useful alternatives to overcome the shortcomings of their parent
complexes.

Conclusions
In summary, new heteroleptic complexes
of cobalt using aminoalkoxides
and β-diketonates were successfully synthesized using controlled
two-step substitution reactions with Co(btsa)2. Both the
partially substituted first-step compounds and final compounds were
obtained as dimers in their crystal structures. The alkoxy oxygen
of the aminoalkoxide used in this work acted as a bridge between two
cobalt metal centers by μ2–O bonding. In those
complexes, the metal center appeared to have a tetrahedral geometry
in 1, whereas their geometry appeared to be trigonal
bipyramidal in complexes 3–7. The
TGA curves for complexes 4–7 displayed
minimal nonvolatile residues, indicating their possible vaporization
in the process. The sublimation studies revealed the excellent volatile
character of complexes 6 and 7 at 120 and
130 °C under 0.5 Torr, respectively. Even though complexes 3–7 were in the dimeric state, all of
the complexes displayed good stabilities at high temperatures. In
particular, 6 and 7 displayed excellent
volatilities and stabilities compared with their respective parent
homoleptic complexes available from commercial sources. Studies for
the application of 6 and 7 as precursors
for the deposition of cobalt and cobalt oxide thin films by an ALD
process are in progress.

Experimental Section
Materials
FT-IR
spectra were obtained using a Nicolet
Nexus FT-IR spectrophotometer with a 4 mm KBr window or KBr pellets.
The KBr pellets for the samples were prepared by a standard pellet
technique inside an argon-filled glovebox. The elemental analyses
were performed with a Thermo Scientific OEA Flash 2000 analyzer. The
thermogravimetric analyses were conducted on a Thermo plus EVO II
TG8120 series thermogravimetry and differential thermal analysis instrument
under a constant flow of nitrogen. The mass spectra were recorded
using a JEOL JMS-700 spectrometer operating in electron ionization
(EI) mode. All of the reactions, except for the ligand preparations,
were performed under inert and dry conditions using standard Schlenk
techniques or in an argon-filled glovebox. Co(btsa)2,28,29 dmampH, and dmambH were synthesized by a slightly modified literature
method.30 Hexane, THF, and toluene were
purified using an Innovative Technology PS-MD-4 solvent purification
system. All of the chemicals were purchased from Aldrich and used
as received.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of [Co(aminoalkoxide)(btsa)]2 Complexes
A THF solution (10 mL) of aminoalcohol
was added dropwise to a solution of Co(btsa)2 in THF (50
mL) at −78 °C with constant stirring and was stirred for
1 h at that temperature. The reaction mixture was slowly warmed to
room temperature and then stirred for another 15 h. After the completion
of the reaction, the volatiles were removed in vacuo and the residue
was extracted into toluene and filtered. The toluene was removed to
obtain the crude product. X-ray-quality crystals were grown from a
saturated solution in toluene upon cooling at −30 °C.

Crystallography
Single crystals of 1 were
grown from a toluene solution at −30 °C, and single crystals
of 3–7 were grown from a hexane solution
at −30 °C. A specimen of suitable size and quality was
coated with paratone oil and mounted onto a glass capillary. Reflection
data of 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 were collected on a Bruker Apex II-CCD area
detector diffractometer, with graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation
(λ = 0.71073 Å). The hemisphere of reflection data was
collected as ω-scan frames with 0.3° per frame and an exposure
time of 10 s per frame. Cell parameters were determined and refined
using the SMART program.31 Data reduction
was performed using the SAINT software.32 The data were corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects. An
empirical absorption correction was applied using the SADABS program.33 A crystal of 7 was coated with
paratone oil and the diffraction data measured at 173 K with Mo Kα
radiation on an X-ray diffraction camera system using an imaging plate
equipped with a graphite crystal incident beam monochromator. The
RapidAuto software was used for data collection and data processing.34 The structures were solved by direct methods,
and all of the nonhydrogen atoms were subjected to anisotropic refinement
by a full-matrix least-squares methods on F2 using the SHELXTL/PC
package.35 Hydrogen atoms were placed at
their geometrically calculated positions and were refined based on
the corresponding carbon atoms with isotropic thermal parameters.
