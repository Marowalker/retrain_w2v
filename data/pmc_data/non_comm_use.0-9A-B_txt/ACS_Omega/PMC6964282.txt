Danofloxacin (DAF), a third-generation
fluroquinolone
(FQ), is
widely used as a broad-spectrum antibacterial drug to prevent diseases
in livestock and poultry. In this study, a highly specific and sensitive
monoclonal antibody (mAb) against DAF was prepared. Also, the mAb
was used for the indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (icELISA) and immunochromatographic strip for the detection
of DAF residues in meat. The IC50 of the icELISA based
on this mAb was 1.39 ng/mL, and the limit of detection was 0.2 ng/mL.
According to the cross-reactivity (CR) experiment, the ELISA that
we developed was highly specific and had low CR with other FQ analogues.
Moreover, the cut-off of the immunochromatographic strip developed
for detecting DAF in meat was 5 ng/mL. Overall, the developed ELISA
and immunochromatographic strip based on the prepared mAb were proved
reliable for the rapid detection of DAF in meat and can be considered
as effective screening methods for food safety and quality management.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Danofloxacin (DAF), a
broad-spectrum fluroquinolone (FQ) antibacterial
drug,1,2 is widely used to prevent and treat infectious
diseases in animals.3,4 However, antimicrobial resistance,5,6 hemolytic-uremic syndrome,7 thromboembolism,8 and adverse effects on the central nervous system9 have been reported owing to DAF abuse. Therefore,
some countries established maximum residue levels (MRLs) of DAF in
different animal species and tissues. In the USA, only 200 ng/g of
DAF residue in the liver or muscle of cattle is permitted by the Food
and Drug Administration. In the EU, the MRLs of DAF are 200 ng/g for
bovine muscle and 400 ng/g for liver or kidney.10 In China, the MRLs of DAF set by the Ministry of Agriculture
(no. 278, 2003.5.22) are 200 ng/g for muscle, 100 ng/g for fat, 400
ng/g for liver, 400 ng/g for kidney, and 30 ng/g for milk in cattle
and sheep.

Thus far, many instrumental analytical methods11−13 have been developed
for the detection of DAF residues. These methods can quantitatively
and qualitatively detect DAF and other veterinary drugs. However,
these methods are limited by their need of highly trained personnel,
bulky apparatus, and complicated preparation.14 Immunochemical methods are alternative approaches owing to their
simplicity, rapid operation, and cost-effectiveness.15,16 Shanin et al.17 established a fluorescence
polarization immunoassay and ELISA based on polyclonal antibodies,
which exhibited a limit of detection (LOD) for DAF of 13 ng/mL. Liu
et al.18 prepared an anti-DAF antibody
using New Zealand white rabbits and developed an ELISA for DAF residue
in chicken liver with an IC50 value of 2.0 ng/mL. Sheng
et al.19 developed an ELISA based on polyclonal
antibody using New Zealand white rabbits for the detection of DAF
residue in beef, chicken, and pork muscles, which exhibited an IC50 value of 5.4 ng/mL. To the best of our knowledge, these
studies were based on polyclonal antibodies obtained from New Zealand
white rabbits, and no immunoassays based on murine monoclonal antibodies
(mAb) have been reported. In contrast to polyclonal antibodies, mAb
have the advantages of stable performance, high specificity, and high
cost-efficiency in the long term. Therefore, in this study, a mAb
against DAF was prepared, and an ELISA and immunochromatographic strip
based on the prepared mAb were developed to detect DAF in meat.

2 Materials and Method
2.1 Reagents and Instruments
FQ standards
including DAF, ofloxacin (OFL), moxifloxacin (MOX), ciprofloxacin
(CIP), cinoxacin (CIN), sarafloxacin (SAR), fleroxacin (FLE), enrofloxacin
(ENR), marbofloxacin (MAR), and pefloxacin (PEF) were purchased from
J&K Scientific Ltd. (Shanghai, China). 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)
carbodiimide (EDC), N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (NHS),
Freund’s incomplete adjuvant, Freund’s complete adjuvant,
bovine serum albumin (BSA), and ovalbumin (OVA) were obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Horseradish peroxidase-labeled
goat antimouse secondary antibody (HRP-sAb) was purchased from Univ-bio
Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Reagents used for cell fusion, such as
HAT and HT solutions, were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific
Inc. (Shanghai, China). Other reagents and chemicals were acquired
from the National Pharmaceutical Group Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.
(Shanghai, China). The nitrocellulose (NC) membrane, absorbent pad,
and sample pad were purchased from Millipore (Bedford, MA).

Eight-week-old female BALB/c mice were obtained from the Nanchang
University Laboratory Animal Center (Nanchang, China).

A BioDot
XYZ platform equipped with a motion controller was supplied
by BioDot (Irvine, CA). A portable gold nanoparticle (GNP) reader
(HELMEN) was purchased from Zhejiang Fenghang Science Instrument Co.,
Ltd. (Zhejiang, China). A high-speed freezing centrifuge was purchased
from Xiang Yi (Hunan, China). A vacuum-drying oven was purchased from
Shanghai Fumma Laboratory Instrument Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China).

2.2 Preparation of the Immune and Coating Antigens
The immune antigen was prepared by coupling DAF to BSA using the
active ester method, according to previous study.20,21 The specific procedure was as follows: 1 mM DAF, 8 mM EDC, and 8
mM NHS were dissolved in 200 μL of 0.01 M phosphate buffered
saline (PBS, pH = 7.4) and stirred at room temperature for 4 h in
the dark. Then, the mixtures were added dropwise to 10 nM BSA in 0.01
M carbonate buffer solution (pH = 9.6) and stirred overnight. The
danofloxacin–bovine serum albumin (DAF–BSA) was obtained
after the above reactants were dialyzed for 3 days in 0.01 M PBS.
The coating antigen danofloxacin–ovalbumin (DAF–OVA)
was synthesized in the same way. The successful couple of the complete
antigens was verified by an UV spectrophotometer.

2.3 Production of mAb
The mAb was obtained
by immunizing healthy female BABL/C mice through hypodermic injection.
To obtain high-quality antibodies, the mice were immunized multiple
times at an interval of 3 weeks. For the first time, the immunization
was performed with 100 μg/mouse immunogen (DAF–BSA) emulsified
in Freund’s complete adjuvant. The immunization dose was changed
to 50 μg/mouse immunogen (DAF–BSA) emulsified in Freund’s
incomplete adjuvant in the next four immunizations. One week after
the fifth immunization, the mice were tail-bled, and the serum was
evaluated by indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(icELISA) to select a fusion mouse with the best affinity and inhibition
for DAF. Three days before the fusion, the selected mouse was boosted
with 25 μg of immune antigen mixed with saline. For the fusion,
the selected mouse was killed, and its spleen was removed to fuse
with SP2/0 myeloma cells at the exponential stage. The icELISA was
performed for screening hybridoma cells with high affinity and inhibition
after they were cultured in HAT solution for 4 days and in HT solution
for 3 days. Subsequently, the selected hybridoma cells were cloned
three times by limiting the dilution to form stable cell lines. The
cloned hybridoma cells were injected into the abdomen of mice to produce
ascites. Then, the ascitic fluid was purified by the saturated ammonium
sulfate purification method to obtain mAb.

2.4 icELISA
Process
The mAb wasevaluated
with icELISA, which was slightly modified compared with conventional
icELISA. Briefly, a 96-well microplate was coated with 100 μL/well
coating antigen DAF–OVA for 2 h. Then, the microplate was washed
three times with washing solution and blocked with 200 μL/well
blocking buffer for another 2 h. After removing the blocking solution
and washing the plate three times, 50 μL of standards and 50
μL of mAb in 0.01 M PBS were added to react for 1 h. After washing,
100 μL/well of HRP-sAb (diluted 1:3000 with 0.01 M PBS) was
added to react for 30 min. The excess HRP-sAb was then washed, and
100 μL/well of TMB solution was added to develop color changes.
After 15 min, 50 μL of 2 M H2SO4 was added
to terminate the reaction. The entire experiment was reacted in an
incubator at 37 °C. Finally, the optical density (OD) at 450
nm was read using a microplate reader for evaluating the mice serum
and mAb.

2.5 Evaluation of mAb with icELISA
A
series of DAF standard in 0.01 M PBS was prepared (0, 0.3, 0.6, 1.2,
2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 30 ng/mL) for establishing the standard calibration
curve to evaluate the LOD of the mAb. Each concentration was analyzed
by optimized icELISA in triplicate. Nine FQ analogues including OFL,
MOX, CIP, CIN, SAR, FLE, ENR, MAR, and PEF were used to evaluate the
specificity of the mAb by the icELISA. Each measurement was analyzed
in three replicates. Also, the concentrations of the nine FQ analogues
were 0, 20, 60, 180, 540, 1080, 3240, and 9720 ng/mL. The cross-reactivity
(CR) values were calculated with the following equation: CR (%) =
(IC50 value of DAF/IC50 value of the analogue
tested) × 100%.

2.6 Recovery Test in Meat
Standard calibration
curve and recovery test in duck meat were performed as similar as
0.01 M PBS. Briefly, the duck from Jiangxi Huangshanghuang Group Food
Co., Ltd. was confirmed negative by Jiangxi Entry–Exit Inspection
and Quarantine Bureau using LC/MS/MS. Five grams of ground duck samples
was weighed into a polypropylene centrifuge tube (50 mL) for DAF detection.
The duck samples were spiked with standard DAF at different amounts
(10, 30, and 300 ng). The mixture was vortexed for 10 min using 5
mL of 0.2 M acetate buffer (pH = 5.6). After centrifugation at 8000g for 10 min, the supernatant (diluted to 10 mL with 0.01
M PBS) was used for the recovery test at the same icELISA conditions.
Each spiked sample was repeated in quadruplicate. The OD at 450 nm
was read. The recovery rate was the ratio of measured value to DAF
amount spiked in duck meat. The measured value was calculated by the
OD450 value of the sample and the standard calibration
curve for detecting DAN in meat. Also, the error bar was obtained
by calculating the standard deviation (SD) of experimental data.

2.7 Preparation of Immunochromatographic Strips
and Optimization of Key Parameters
GNPs were prepared in
accordance with a previously reported method.22 The sample pad and NC membrane were pretreated in accordance with
previous methods.23 Approximately, 0.74
μL/cm of DAF–OVA (0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4 mg/mL) was
sprayed on the NC membrane as test (T) lines by using the BioDot XYZ
platform. Goat antimouse IgG was sprayed on the NC membrane as the
control (C) line. The NC membrane was dried at 37 °C for 12 h.
Finally, the sample pad, NC membrane, and absorbent pad were assembled
as the immunochromatographic strip. Then, the GNP–mAb complex
was prepared as follows. First, the pH (5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) of GNP
solution was adjusted with 0.2 M K2CO3. Under
gentle stirring, 100 μL of mAb (2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4 μg/mL)
diluted with ultrapure water was added dropwise to 1 mL of the GNP
solution to form the GNP–mAb complex, which was added to the
immunochromatographic strips as a signal tracer. Besides, the immunological
kinetic curve between GNP–mAb and DAF–OVA on the T line
was established by plotting the signal of the T line when the concentrations
of DAF were 0 and 3 ng/g.

2.8 Analysis Performance of
the mAb with the Immunochromatographic
Strip
The PBS solution or supernatant of meat samples incubated
with the GNP–mAb complex was added to the sample pad and immediately
migrated toward the absorbent pad. During the migration process, DAF
in the PBS solution or meat sample competitively bound to the GNP–mAb
complex with the DAF–OVA on the T line, resulting in a regular
color change of the T line. The result was detected with a portable
GNP reader. To evaluate the analysis performance of the mAb with the
immunochromatographic strip, a standard competitive inhibition curve
was obtained by plotting 1 – T/T0 against the DAF concentrations.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Principles of Preparing
and Evaluating the
mAb
The preparation of the mAb was based on hybridoma technology.
Briefly, the process involves immunogen synthesis, immunization, cell
fusion, positive cell screening, ascites collection, and purification.
The evaluation of the mAb was based on icELISA and immunochromatographic
strip. The principle of icELISA is that the analyte competes with
the immobilized antigen to bind with the antibody. The method is particularly
useful for detecting small molecule haptens with only one antigenic
determinant, with a high sensitivity and high specificity. The process
of preparation and evaluation is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Schematic of preparation and evaluation of the
mAb.

3.2 Characterization
of the Immune and Coating
Antigens
Antigens are important for the preparation of mAb.
The immunogen and coating antigen were prepared by the active ester
method as shown in Figure 2A. Also, they were characterized using a UV–vis spectrophotometer
(Figure 2B). Figure 2B shows that the
absorption peaks of DAF at 282 and 347 nm migrated to 285 and 328
nm after DAF conjugated with BSA, indicating that the DAF–BSA
conjugate was successfully prepared. Similarly, the DAF–OVA
conjugate was successfully prepared as confirmed by the appearance
of two characteristic absorption peaks of 282 and 319 nm (Figure 2C).

DAF–BSA. (C) UV–vis spectra of coating antigen DAF–OVA.

3.3 Preparation and Evaluation
of mAb with icELISA
The serum of mice immunized with DAF–BSA
immunogen and positive
clones was evaluated by icELISA. After repeating the cloning process
three times, the cell line 1H1 and the corresponding antibody named
mAb-1H1 with good specificity and sensitivity were obtained.

The affinity and inhibition of mAb-1H1 were evaluated with the developed
icELISA. The calibration curve was constructed by plotting the OD450 values versus the logarithm of the DAF concentrations (0–30
ng/mL). As shown in Figure 3, the linear regression equation was y =
−0.374 ln(x) + 0.8092. The LOD was 0.2 ng/mL,
which was defined as the mean of the negative sample minus threefold
SD,24 and the IC50 was 1.39
ng/mL. The results indicated that the prepared mAb was more sensitive
compared with polyclonal antibodies from rabbits. As shown in Table 1, mAb-1H1 showed high
specificity except with CIP (1.93%) and OFL (1.88%). The same cyclopropyl
and piperazine ring at the mother ring of CIP may be the reason for
the low CR value. Given that their only difference is the heterocyclic
ring (Table 1), the
low CR value of OFL indicates that the recognition of the antigen
and antibody was affected by the degree of hybridization.

3.4 Recovery Experiment of
DAF in Meat
The standard calibration curve in meat was y = −0.455
In(x) + 1.8415 (Figure 4), and the LOD was 0.798 ng/g. Recovery experiments
were conducted using the developed icELISA in duck samples. As shown
in Table 2, the recovery
rate ranged from 85.97 to 100.65%, and reproducibility (n = 4) showed that the SD ranged from 0.003 to 0.025. Therefore, the
developed icELISA was reliable and stable for the determination of
DAF in duck meat.

3.5 Optimization
of Key Parameters of the Immunochromatographic
Strip
Some key parameters, including the pH of labeling the
mAb, the concentrations of the mAb and DAF–OVA, and time, were
optimized for the best performance of the immunochromatographic strip.
pH was a decisive factor for forming GNP–mAb. The labeling
efficiency gradually increased with the pH increasing from 5 to 6
and then dropped off quickly when the pH further increased to 9 (Figure 5A). Thus, pH = 6
was selected to form the GNP–mAb. The concentrations of the
mAb and DAF–OVA directly affected the intensity of detection
signals and inhibitory rate, which were the key factors determining
the detection sensitivity of the immunochromatographic strip. Thus,
the concentrations of DAF–OVA and the mAb were optimized as
1.2 mg/mL and 3.5 μg/mL, respectively, to ensure high signal
value and inhibition rate (Figure 5B,C). Also, the immunological kinetic curve is shown
in Figure 5D. The detection
signal value gradually increased with time within 30 min and tended
to stabilize after 30 min. Thirty minutes was selected as the final
quantitative detection of DAF.

DAF in meat based on the
immunochromatographic strip. (A) pH of labeling mAb with GNPs; (B)
concentration of DAF–OVA on T line; (C) concentration of mAb;
and (D) immunological kinetic curve. The error bars represent the
SDs of three measurements.

3.6 Analysis Performance of mAb with the Immunochromatographic
Strip
PBS solution or meat samples spiked with different
concentrations of DAF were analyzed using the lateral-flow immunochromatographic
strip. The standard curve for detecting DAF in PBS was y = 0.3149 In(x) + 0.0533 (R2 = 09881), and the LOD was 0.24 ng/mL (Figure 6A). Figure 6B shows that the cut-off was 3 ng/mL for DAF in PBS.
As shown in Figure 7A, the standard competitive inhibition curve in meat was y = 0.1864x – 0.02, and the LOD
was be 0.95 ng/g. Figure 7B shows the sensitivity of the test strips, and the cut-off
value was 5 ng/g, which indicated that the lateral-flow immunochromatographic
strip developed here is sensitive, accurate, and suitable for DAF
detection in meat samples.

Besides, the method we developed have been compared
with other
detection methods in detection range and detection limit (Table 3), which indicated
that the methods we developed are significant for detecting DAF in
foodstuffs.

study, a sensitive
and specific mAb against DAF was prepared
for the first time. An icELISA based on the mAb was developed for

ng/mL. The CR experiment indicated that the developed icELISA was
highly specific and had low CR with other FQ drugs. An immunochromatographic
