A facile hydrothermal method is adopted
for the synthesis of hierarchical
flowerlike nickel sulfide nanostructure materials and their composite
with carbon quantum dot (NiS/C-dot) composite. The composite material
exhibited good performance for electrochemical energy-storage devices
as supercapacitor with a specific capacity of 880 F g–1 at a current density of 2 A g–1. The material
remained stable up to the tested 2000 charge–discharge cycles.
Carbon quantum dots of size 1.3 nm were synthesized from natural sources
and the favorable electronic and surface property of C-dots were utilized
for improvement of the supercapacitor performance of NiS. The results
from Tafel analysis, double-layer capacitance, and the impedance measurement
reveal that the incorporation of C-dots inside the NiS matrix has
improved the charge-transfer process, which is mainly responsible
for the enhancement of the supercapacitive property of the composite
materials.

1 Introduction
Electrochemical
supercapacitors have attracted many researchers
in the recent years because of their high power density than batteries,
long cyclic life, and higher energy density than conventional dielectric
capacitors as energy-storage devices. In addition to that supercapacitors
score high in terms of environmental friendliness among the energy-storage
devices. In recent years, various metal sulfides, oxides, and their
nanocomposites such as NiCo2S4, Ni3S2, CuS, SnS2, CoS2, and CoS have
been reported for their highly reversible electrochemical redox process,
long cyclic stability, high charge-storage capacity through pseudocapacitance,
and unique physical and chemical properties. Among different metal
sulfides, nickel sulfides and their composites are particularly important
due to their high electrical conductivity, cost-effectiveness, and
good mechanical stability. There have been various reports utilizing
different procedures for the synthesis of nickel sulfide and its different
composite materials and their application as supercapacitor.1−32 Nickel sulfide present in different stoichiometric forms such as
NiS, Ni3S2, Ni6S5, Ni7S6, and Ni9S8 and all of
these stoichiometric forms have importance in energy-storage applications,
fuel cells, water splitting, and Li-ion batteries. Conductivity of
nickel sulfide is generally good for its application as supercapacitor;
however, there are contradiction in its reported conductivity and
the materials in prolonged use suffer loss in conductivity owing to
the nonuniformity in grain size and their distribution.9,10 NiS also reported to have undergone decay in the supercapacitive
property on repetitive charge–discharge cycles, and the incorporation
of the conducting support materials improves the cycle stability of
the materials.33 Therefore, the requirement
of the addition of other agents with NiS to improve the supercapacitive
property is twofold: it increases the conductivity of the NiS and
also stabilizes the materials on long-term charge–discharge
cycles. Incorporation of conducting carbon-based materials is one
of the preferred choices to improve the conductivity of the metal
oxide- and sulfide-based supercapacitors. Carbon has been used as
activated carbon, carbon nanotube,34,35 and graphene.33 Recently, carbon quantum dots (C-dots)36 and graphene quantum dots37 have shown promising results in the improvement of the
supercapacitors. C-dots are quasi zero-dimensional nanomaterials with
very high chemical stability and these are highly soluble in water
with very good possibility of functionalization. The excellent electrochemical
and photochemical properties of the C-dots make them a promising candidate
in catalysis,38−41 sensing,42 and supercapacitor applications.43

Under the present investigation, the C-dots
have been synthesized
from lemon juice by adapting the hydrothermal route to prepare NiS
with C-dots nanocomposite. A single-step novel approach has been adapted
to the synthesis of hierarchical flowerlike NiS/C-dots nanostructure
by hydrothermal method without using any precipitating reagent or
any template. To the best of our knowledge, no report on the supercapacitor
property of NiS/C-dots composite exists in the literature. Here, flowerlike
NiS nanostructures were obtained. The supercapacitive properties of
the NiS/C-dots nanocomposites have been investigated and compared
to the pristine NiS. The specific capacity was significantly higher
in the case of hybrid composite material than the pristine NiS, and
the synergistic effect of C-dots incorporation inside the NiS nanostructures
toward the improvements of supercapacitance has been discussed in
the manuscript. In addition to providing better conductivity of charge
to the composite materials, C-dots have the additional advantage that
they can increase the capacitance through the incorporation of additional
positive charges into the matrix.44 In
contrast, there is a possibility of decrease in the surface area of
porous materials in the presence of C-dots, which is essentially due
to the filling of the pores of NiS materials by the C-dots. It would
therefore be interesting to investigate and discuss the electrochemical
properties of the NiS and C-dots composite materials and to compare
the behavior with pristine NiS materials, which would fetch out some
of the interesting aspects of the electrochemical behavior of NiS
in relation to the supercapacitance properties.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Spectroscopic and Microscopic
Characterization
of the Material
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) measurements of the materials are shown
in Figure 1. FTIR measurements
indicated the presence of C=O, C–H, O–H, C–O–C,
and C=C groups on the surface of the carbon dots (Figure 1A). The NiS/C-dots
composite material showed three prominent FTIR signals at 3214, 1639,
and 1074 cm–1, corresponding to the O–H,
C=C, and C–O bonds, respectively (Figure 1B). Therefore, during the formation of NiS/C-dots
composite materials by hydrothermal treatment, most of the functional
groups of the C-dots were reduced and the corresponding FTIR signals
were not observed. This in turn would form partially reduced C-dots
in the NiS/C-dots composite materials. The TEM images of the C-dots
with two different resolutions are shown in Figure 1C,D. C-dots were nearly uniform in size and
the high-resolution image has revealed the mean diameter of the C-dots
as 2.5 nm. The size of the C-dots was also measured using dynamic
light scattering method, and the results are shown in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information. The
mean diameter of the particles obtained was 1.3 nm.

image of C-dots at two different resolutions.

The composite materials as synthesized using hydrothermal
method
were characterized using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) to predict
the crystal structure, and the corresponding diffraction patterns
are shown in Figure 2A,B. All of the diffraction peaks were indexed to pure NiS in a rhombohedral
structure with crystal lattice parameter a = 9.620, c = 3.149 (JCPDF #12-0041). The diffraction pattern of NiS/C-dots
nanocomposite material matches that of the pristine NiS, signifying
no significant change in the crystal structure of the NiS due to the
formation of composite with C-dots.

and (B) pristine NiS.

The morphology of the materials was obtained using field
emission
scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) measurements. Figure 3A,B shows the FESEM images
of the NiS/C-dots composite material, and Figure 3C,D shows the FESEM images of pristine NiS.
Results indicate the synthesis of well-defined hierarchical flowerlike
NiS nanostructure. The length of each flower petal is ∼0.8
μm in NiS/C-dots composite. In the case of pristine NiS, the
SEM patterns are different from those of the composite material, which
showed rodlike patterns. NiS has two major morphological forms: flowerlike
NiS (f-NiS) and rodlike NiS (r-NiS). Both the morphological forms
are reported to be having the same crystal structure,45 which has also been observed in the present case. The f-NiS
is reported to be formed through the diffusion-limited aggregation.46 Since the f-NiS has been formed only with the
presence of C-dots, the C-dots are responsible for the formation of
f-NiS morphology. The rodlike NiS is formed through the flake-cracking
mechanism, and it has been reported that NiS initially formed a sheetlike
morphology, later the flakes are cracked in the form of nanorod and
materials are transformed into rodlike morphology. The flake-cracking
mechanism has also been reported in the case of biomolecule-assisted
synthesis of single-crystalline selenium nanowires and nanoribbons.47 It would therefore be interesting to observe
the difference in the electrochemical property from the two materials
by adding the contribution from the improvement in conductivity for
introduction of C-dots in the NiS and also due to the difference in
the morphology of the two materials as revealed from the microscopic
measurements.

B); pristine
NiS at different resolutions (C, D).

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements of the NiS/C-dots
composite
and the pristine NiS were recorded, and the results are shown in Figure S2. The nanopetals as observed in the
SEM and TEM measurements could not be resolved in the AFM image. However,
the difference in the morphology of the NiS/C-dots composite and the
pristine NiS could be well observed. The composite has shown structural
arrangements of elongated grains, which can be considered as the poorly
resolved nanopetal as observed from the SEM and TEM measurements.
The clusters of the grains were distributed all along the composite
materials for pristine NiS, the AFM morphology was characterized as
needle-type shape of the grains, and the morphology resembles with
the SEM image as shown in Figure 3D.

TEM images of the NiS/C-dots composite and
pristine NiS are shown
in Figure 4A,B. The
composite material is characterized with the nanoflower-type morphology
and the flower petals were very well spread all over the substrate.
The pristine material has shown nanowire-type pattern; however, the
nanowires were not well organized all over the substrate of the materials.
The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of the composite
and the pristine materials were also obtained and are shown in Figure 4C,D, The d-spacing
of 0.25 nm in the case of NiS/C-dots composite materials indicates
the presence of (002) plane, which has also been supported from the
XRD measurements with the peak at 35.9°. In the case of pristine
NiS material, the d spacing was obtained as 0.47
nm, which corresponds to the (110) plane of the NiS material. This
has also been supported by the X-ray diffraction peak, where the diffraction
pattern from the (110) plane of NiS was observed at 18.5°.32 In composite materials, the C-dots are not separately
seen; however, their presence strongly dictates the morphology of
the NiS.

NiS (B, D).

The chemical state and
molecular environment of the NiS/C-dots
composite material were investigated through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS). The peaks 166, 284, 529, and 854.4 eV in the wide-scan XPS
image of Figure 5A
referring to S 2p, C 1s, O 1s, and Ni 2p, respectively, confirm the
presence of S, C, O, and Ni elements in NiS/C-dots composite material.48 The high-resolution XPS images of Ni 2p in the
NiS/C-dots composite material are shown in the Figure 5B; the peaks at 854.2 and 872.4 eV are assigned
to the binding energies of Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2, respectively.49 Two other peaks at binding
energies 859.1 and 878.1 eV are the satellite peaks of Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2, respectively, which indicated the presence
of coulomb interaction between core holes and valence electrons.50,51 The peaks at 161.4 and 162.5 eV in the high-resolution S 2p spectrum
of NiS/C-dots composite materials (Figure 5C), corresponding to S 2p3/2 and
S 2p1/2, suggest the presence of divalent sulfide ions
(S2–) in the NiS/C-dots composite materials.52 The peak at 166.5 eV could be recognized as
S–O bond due to the surface oxidation.52 The deconvoluted C 1s spectra of NiS/C-dots composite materials
in Figure 5D consist
of a main peak at 284.5 eV, which corresponds to the C–C bond
with sp2 orbital. The other peaks at the binding energies
285.6, 286.7, 287.2, and 288.6 eV correspond to the sp3 C–C-bonded carbon, C–O–C, C=O, and C–OH,
suggesting the surface functional groups on the NiS/C-dots composite
material. These XPS results indicated that NiS/C-dots composite materials
were successfully formed, which are quite consistent with the XRD
and FTIR analyses.

2.2 Electrochemical Investigations
After
spectroscopic and microscopic characterizations of the materials,
the electrochemical properties of the materials have been investigated
by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge
measurements, and electrochemical impedance measurements.53,54 CV measurements were carried out in 2 M KOH as the electrolyte in
multiple cycles at a scan rate of 10 mV s–1, and
the results are shown in Figure 6A,B. CV plot has indicated that the composite material
exhibited pseudocapacitive nature and one oxidation peak and corresponding
reduction peak appeared in the CV plot; both the materials have shown
stable cyclic voltammetry profile. The reversibility of the material
was due to the symmetric nature of the redox process as obtained from
the CV measurements. On multiple cycles, the NiS/C-dots composite
materials showed sharp increase in the capacitive nature of the electrochemical
process and the enhancement in current was saturated after around
50 cycles. The CV plot of the pristine NiS has also been characterized
with one oxidation peak and the corresponding one reduction peak.
The capacitive and redox current did not increase significantly with
the multiple cycles in the cyclic voltammetry measurements. The measured
current density in the case of the NiS/C-dots composite materials
is significantly high compared to the pristine NiS. The separation
between the oxidation and the reduction peaks in the case of NiS/C-dots
composite is around 0.21 V, whereas the same in pristine NiS material
is around 0.29 V. The larger peak separation in pristine NiS compared
to the NiS/C-dots composite materials is related to the rate of the
charge-transfer process. The composite materials thus have shown better
charge-transport property compared to the pristine materials. CV experiments
were further carried out at different scan rates to delineate the
relative charge-transfer process in two materials, and the results
are shown in Figure 6C,D. The current density increased with increase in the scan rate
of the measurements. The anodic peak current and the cathodic peak
current were plotted with respect to the scan rates, and the plots
are shown in Figure S3A,B in the Supporting
Information. No linear correlation between the anodic and cathodic
peak currents with the scan rates of the measurements is observed.
The peak currents were also plotted with respect to the square root
of the scan rate of the measurements and are shown in the same figure
(Figure S3C,D). The linear correlation
between the peak currents and the square root of the scan rate of
the measurements indicated the diffusion-controlled nature of the
electrochemical oxidation and the reduction process. The linear fitting
resulted higher slope (almost double) for the anodic peak than the
cathodic peak for both the materials. In the anodic scans, the anions
ingress inside the materials, and the higher slope is indicative of
the higher rate of ingress of the ions from the composite materials
compared to the rate of regress of the ions out of the material matrix.
Larger intercept for the cathodic peak is due to the fact that cathodic
scan was recorded immediately after the anodic scan and there might
not be complete discharge of the electrochemical interface during
the anodic scan; therefore, some charge will always remain attached
prior to the another charging process.

Figure 6 Multiple cyclic voltammetric
plot of (A) NiS/C-dots composite,
(B) pristine NiS and CV plot with scan rate variation, (C) NiS/C-dots
composite, and (D) pristine NiS.

When the slope and the intercept of two materials were compared,
the values are observed to be much higher in the case of the NiS/C-dots
composite compared to the pristine NiS. Higher slope for the composite
materials is indicative of the faster charge-transfer process, and
the larger intercept is due to the enhanced amount of electrostatic
charge associated in the composite materials compared to the pristine
NiS.

After having the idea about the electron-transfer process,
the
pure capacitive nature of the substrates was obtained from the double-layer
capacitive measurements by recording the CV at different scan rates
at the double-layer region, and the corresponding plots are shown
in Figure 7A,B. The
current density at the capacitive region is higher in the case of
pristine NiS compared to the composite materials. The double-layer
capacitance was calculated and plotted with respect to the scan rate
of the measurements, and is shown in Figure S4A,B of the Supporting Information. The measured double-layer capacitance
was marginally higher in the case of pristine materials than the composite
materials at lower scan rates. However, the double-layer capacitance
decreased drastically in pristine materials with increase in the scan
rate and its values are significantly lower compared to the composite
material at moderate scan rate of the measurements. Therefore, the
number of electrochemically active sites available for the electrostatic
charging as reflected by low scan rate is nearly similar in the two
materials. In the case of pristine materials, some of these active
sites might be deep inside the matrix, and at higher scan rates, those
sites could not be accessed, which resulted in the fast drop in the
measured capacitance values. On the other hand, in NiS/C-dots composite
materials, the NiS is infused with highly conducting C-dots; therefore,
the transport of charge deep inside the matrix of the materials is
quite fast.

Figure 7 Scan rate variation at low double-layer region: (A) NiS/C-dots
composite. (B) Pristine NiS Tafel plot of (C) NiS/C-dots composite
and (D) pristine NiS.

The specific capacity of the composite materials can be calculated
from the measured current density of CV curve on dividing the specific
current by the scan rate of the measurements. The maximum specific
capacity of 650 F g–1 was obtained from the CV measurements
at 10 mV s–1 scan rate in the case of NiS/C-dots
composite materials; similarly, in the case of pristine NiS materials,
the specific capacity was obtained as 480 F g–1 at
the scan rate of 10 mV s–1. It is therefore realized
that the specific capacity in NiS/C-dots composite materials is considerably
higher compared to the pristine NiS materials under similar experimental
conditions. Incorporation of carbon dots into the pristine NiS matrix
thus improved the specific capacity of the materials.

The NiS/C-dots
composite materials have shown physical surface
area of around 40% higher than the pristine NiS substrate as obtained
from the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller measurements (for NiS/C-dots
composite, it is 40 m2g–1, and for the
pristine NiS, it is 25 m2 g–1). The electrochemically
active surface area of the materials was measured from the cyclic
voltammetry measurements at different scan rates in the double-layer
region, and the corresponding plots are shown in Figure 7A,B. Double-layer capacitance
of NiS/C-dots composite is about twice that of the pristine NiS, and
the results are shown in Figure S4 of the
Supporting Information. With increase in the scan rates, the double-layer
capacitance increases in the composite materials, whereas in pristine
materials, it was decreased with increase in the scan rates of the
measurements at all scan rates. The higher double-layer capacitance
and maintaining its value up to the scan rates of 60 mV s–1 indicate the enhancement in the electrochemically active centers
on inclusion of C-dots with NiS matrix, and the rates of the arrangements
of the charges over the double layers became higher. Higher double-layer
capacitance at large scan rates indicates faster charge-transport
process.

To delineate the electrochemical processes involved
in two materials,
the Tafel plots were constructed from the CV plot, and are shown in Figure 7C,D, The Tafel slope
values as obtained from the CV measurements are placed as inset of
the plots. The Tafel slope for the composite material was lower compared
to the pristine materials. Lower Tafel slope is indicative of the
better charge-transfer process in NiS/C-dots composite materials compared
to the pristine NiS materials. It was further observed that with multiple
cycles, the value of the Tafel slope decreased in both the materials.
The structural/morphological changes, which could be responsible for
the enhancement of the charge-transfer process with multiple cycles
were ascertained. No structural changes are observed after the samples
undergo electrochemical testing, which has been confirmed from XRD
measurements, as shown in Figure S5. Morphological
analysis of the samples, after the electrochemical test was carried
out using SEM and AFM measurements, showed no significant change in
the morphology of the materials after the electrochemical test of
2000 charge–discharge cycles, and the figures are shown in Figure S6 of the Supporting Information. Other
possibility for the betterment in the charge-transfer property is
due to the modification in the charge distribution of the materials
after initial cycles. A similar observation has been reported previously
in NiS, which has been explained due to the activation of the electrode
materials after initial charge–discharge cycles.55

The galvanostatic charge–discharge
experiments were carried
out in 2 M KOH supporting electrolyte medium at a potential range
of 0–0.5 V, and the plots are shown in Figure S7 in the Supporting Information. Multiple charge–discharge
experiments were carried out at a current density of 2 A g–1. The specific capacities of the composite materials and the pristine
NiS were obtained as 880 and 710 F g–1, respectively.
The charge–discharge curve indicates that the material is stable
up to 2000 charge–discharge cycles. Both the materials have
shown stable charge–discharge characteristics, and the charging
and discharging of the materials are asymmetric in nature. Toward
the end of the charging process, both the materials have shown battery
behavior. Charge–discharge experiments were also carried out
at different applied current densities, and the plots are shown in Figure 8A,B. The slope of
the initial portion of the discharge plot up to 0.3 V is much steeper
in the case of pristine NiS material compared to the NiS/C-dots composite
material. Later portion of the discharge plot from 0.3 to 0 V is almost
similar in shape. For the same current density, the steep slope of
the discharge plot is indicative of the lower capacitive property
of the material. The shape of the discharge plot is similar to that
of the NiS materials reported earlier.8,56 The observed
plateau during the discharge process is indicative of the pseudocapacitive
behavior of the material. The discharge characteristics of the nickel
oxide materials, however, are different from those of the NiS, and
the plateau region as observed in the NiS is not observed in nickel
oxide. Although nickel oxide shows good supercapacitive performance,
it suffers low electrical conductivity, and its performance is improved
using nickel oxide in its composite form with carbon fiber.57

current
densities (A) NiS/C-dots composite, (B) pristine NiS, and specific
capacity vs current density, (C) NiS/C-dots composite, (D) pristine
NiS, (E) Nyquist plot of NiS/C-dots composite at different applied
potentials, and (F) Nyquist plot of pristine NiS at different applied
potentials.

The discharge capacity
of the materials was measured at different
current densities, and the measured specific capacity was plotted
against the current density of the measurements (cf. Figure 8C,D). The specific capacity
of the composite material is higher compared to the pristine material;
with increase in the current density, the specific capacity increased
initially and then decreased very fast in the case of pristine material
and slowly in the case of composite material. The specific capacity
was measured at multiple charge–discharge cycles and plotted
up to 2000 cycles (from the charge–discharge cycles as in Figure S7), and the results are shown in Figure S8 of the Supporting information. Specific
capacity is increased with multiple cycling up to the charge–discharge
cycle of around 50, after which the measured specific capacity is
stabilized. It remained stable up to the charge–discharge cycles
of 2000 recorded in the present measurements.

2.3 Electrochemical
Impedance Measurement
Electrochemical impedance measurement
provides information about
the electrochemical interface by separating the transport of charge
by overcoming the solution resistance, resistance in the double-layer
region, resistance due to the charge transfer, and diffusion resistance.
For a porous surface, additional pore resistance and pore capacitance
also require to be included for explaining the complete electrochemical
behavior. Supercapacitors have all such electrochemical processes
requiring separate analysis to zero down the complete characterization
of the electrochemical process involved during charging and discharging
process.58 In the present case, impedance
measurements were carried out at different applied potentials of 0.16,
0.46, 0.56, and 0.70 V, and the Nyquist plot are shown in Figure 8E for NiS/C-dots
composite materials. In Figure 8F, the impedance response of pristine NiS is shown. Results
showed low charge-transfer resistance (R2 in the equivalent circuit of Figure S9) in the case of NiS/C-dots composite materials (456 Ω, at
0.46 V) compared to its pristine form NiS (690 Ω, at 0.46 V);
lowering of the charge-transfer resistance is due to the increase
in the charge transport through the incorporation of highly conducting
C-dots. The series resistance is indicative of the electronic conductivity
of the charge since the solution resistances in both the materials
are the same. The series resistance (R1 in the equivalent circuit of Figure S9) decreased from 150 Ω in pristine materials to 75 Ω
in composite material, which indicates the improvement of the electronic
conductivity of the materials due to the incorporation of C-dots and
the improvement in conductivity will improve the transfer of charge
to deep inside the composite materials. About 1.5 times increase of
the charge-transfer resistance indicates the easy charging and discharging
process by improving the interaction of electrolyte ions over the
composite material matrix and improving the redox process of the pseudocapacitor.
The improvement of the conductivity of the material and the charge-transfer
process has been reflected in the cyclic voltammetry measurements,
where the peak potential of NiS has been shifted to lower potential
due to the incorporation of C-dots in the composite material compared
to the pristine material.

The nature of the Nyquist plot varied
with the variation in the applied potential at which the impedance
was recorded. At the applied potential of 0.16 V, the Nyquist plot
showed the restricted finite space Warburg impedance, and with the
shift in the applied potential from 0.16 to 0.46 V, the diffusion
characteristics has been modified to the semi-infinite Warburg diffusion
resistance. On further enhancing the applied potential toward more
positive potentials, the Warburg component ceased. As seen from the
SEM measurements, the materials were having a porous nature due to
the flower petal and rod types of morphology and the electrolyte ions
would get in and out during the electrochemical processes. At a lower
applied potential (0.16 V), since the driving force is not so large,
the Warburg component is high and the restricted finite diffusion
type of nature is revealed. Diffusion process is easier when 0.46
V was applied and ions could diffuse out from dipper part of the composite
materials. At even higher applied potential, no significant diffusion
resistance is observed.

Energy density of the materials was
calculated using the equation 1  The capacitor is considered as the symmetric
type, and the mass change on the counter electrode is same as that
over the working electrode. Energy densities of 30 and 24 Wh kg–1 were obtained for NiS/C-dots composite and pristine
NiS materials, respectively. The power densities when calculated from
the energy densities were obtained as 108 and 86 kW kg–1 for NiS/C-dots composite and pristine NiS materials, respectively.

Considering the materials to be purely capacitive in nature, the
power density (Pmax) was calculated from
the electrode voltage and the electrochemical series resistance of
the electrode using the following relation.59,60 2  where Vmax is
the maximum voltage of the cell, m is mass of the
material, and Resr is the electrochemical
series resistance. The electrochemical series resistance was obtained
from the initial drop in potential of the discharge plot. The maximum
power density was thus obtained as 33 and 16 kW kg–1 for NiS/C-dots and pristine NiS, respectively. The values obtained
from eq 2 are significantly
lower than the power density calculated from the energy density, which
indicates the presence of a significant amount of pseudocapacitive
property of the materials. Calculation of energy and power density
using the measurements from the three-electrode geometry has its issue
of overestimation of the values. There are chances of overestimation
of the values as the mass change at the counter electrode is not exactly
known in three-electrode geometry. The present calculation is made
based on the equal mass change in both working and counter electrodes,
which has been used for the calculation of capacitive properties of
similar materials using three-electrode geometry.61−66

Previous reports have reported a specific capacity of 500–800
F g–1 with flowerlike β NiS materials.8 3D NiS-rGO aerogel nanocomposite showed a reported
capacity of 852 F g–1,23 whereas the NiS/GO nanocomposite showed a specific capacity 800
F g–1.9 A comparison
of the performance of the present material with the similar materials
reported in the literature is presented in Table 1.67−73 The presently developed material thus shows superior electrochemical
performance to the similar materials reported in the literature. Further,
the electrochemical performance of NiS/C-dots is improved on incorporation
of carbon dots inside the NiS matrix. This improvement is attributed
to the improved charge-transfer process through the favorable entanglement
of C-dots along the NiS matrix. Zeta potential was measured, and the
values were obtained for the NiS/C-dots composite and the pristine
NiS materials as −11.5 and −5.6 mV, respectively. High
negative value of the zeta potential indicates that the NiS/C-dots
composite materials could accommodate more negative charge compared
to the pristine materials. The faradic process involved at the interface
of the NiS/C-dots composite modified electrode is74,75 3  Therefore, more negative
zeta potential would
facilitate more accumulation of charge through the formation of NiS(OH)
species during the charging process. While analyzing the results from
Tafel slope, the larger slope of the anodic potential scan compared
to the cathodic scan indicated the better kinetics for the ingress
of the OH– ions inside the matrix of the composite
materials, which has also been supported from the zeta potential measurements.

NiS has reasonably
good electrical conductivity; however, its conductivity
depends strongly on the phase of the NiS, thickness of the films,
and the grain size. Charge conduction through a film depends significantly
on the orientation of the films. Incorporation of carbon dots inside
the NiS matrix has improved the supercapacitive property of the composite
materials due to (1) the incorporation of highly conducting C-dots,
which minimizes the orientation restriction and the size restriction
of the NiS grains and improves the conductivity of the composite materials
and (2) the presence of C-dots all along the composite materials matrix,
which would improve the electrical conductivity of the materials and
reduce the diffusion length of the electrolyte during the charge–discharge
process. Because of all of these factors, the supercapacitance of
NiS improved when in composite with C-dots.

3 Conclusions
Carbon quantum dots were synthesized using the
hydrothermal method
from lemon juice, and the size of the carbon dots was obtained to
be around 1–2 nm. Nanocomposite materials of NiS with carbon
dots were synthesized using the hydrothermal method. Microscopic investigation
revealed the nanoflower structure of the NiS nanophase with the carbon
quantum dots entangled all along the NiS phase. The NiS and its composite
with carbon quantum dots showed significant improvement in the capacitance
properties compared to the pristine NiS materials. Charge transport
of the composite material has improved significantly compared to the
pristine NiS, which has been indicated from the cyclic voltammetry,
charge–discharge, and the Tafel analysis of the electrochemical
investigations. The specific capacity has been significantly improved
with the specific capacity of around 880 and 710 F g–1 obtained in the case of Nis/C-dots and pristine NiS materials, respectively.
Such improvement of the charge-storage property is related to the
enhancement of the charge transport and the surface area of the composite
materials compared to the pristine materials. The present study therefore
indicates the significant improvement of capacitive property of the
transition-metal sulfide material upon having composite with carbon
quantum dots. There is an enormous scope of the incorporation of carbon
quantum dots in making composite with transition-metal oxides and
sulfides for improvement of supercapacitive properties, and research
in this direction would evolve many interesting materials for supercapacitor.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Preparation of Carbon Dots
Carbon
dots were synthesized using hydrothermal method from lemon juice.
Pulp-free lemon juice (40 mL) and absolute ethanol (20 mL) were mixed
well and then taken in a 100 mL Teflon vessel of the autoclave. Hydrogen
peroxide (2 mL) was added dropwise to it, mixed well, and the autoclave
was closed. The Teflon-lined autoclave was kept in a muffle furnace
at 200 °C for 24 h.76,77 After cooling, the
autoclave was opened to obtain a brownish yellow C-dots solution;
the suspension was centrifuged at 5000 rpm to separate black residues.
The supernatant was again centrifuged at 6000 rpm to separate larger
particle and finally the supernatant solution was stored at room temperature
for further use.

4.2 Preparation of NiS/C-Dots
Composite Material
NiS/C-dots composite was prepared through
the hydrothermal method
of synthesis. During the synthesis process, 0.50 mM NiSO4 and 100 mM thiourea were added and made up to the volume of 50 mL.
This solution was sonicated for 10 min. The solution was then transferred
to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave vessel of 100 mL capacity,
and 10 mL of C-dots solution with C-dots concentration of 0.1 mg/mL
was added to it. Then, the autoclave was kept in a muffle furnace
at 200 °C for 24 h, after which it was allowed to cool at room
temperature. The final product was washed with deionized water four
to five times and then with ethanol two to three times and finally
kept in a vacuum oven for drying at 80 °C for 12 h. This material
was then drop-cast over a glassy carbon substrate with a surface area
of 1.5 cm2 with sample loading of 20 mg for making the
electrodes.

4.3 Instrumentation
Electrochemical investigations
were carried out using Hg/HgO (alkaline) as the reference electrode,
a glassy carbon rod as the counter electrode, and the NiS or NiS/C-dots-modified
substrate as the working electrode. All of the experiments were performed
at room temperature (298 K). Electrochemical measurements were performed
using an EcoChemie Potentiostat/Galvanostat, Autolab 302N; the data
acquisition and analysis were carried out using GPES 4.9 and FRA software.
The electrochemical properties of the supercapacitor materials were
investigated in 2 M KOH solution. All of the electrochemical studies
were carried out in static condition. Field Emission Gun-Scanning
Electron Microscopes (FEG-SEM) system model JSM-7600F was used for
SEM measurements. Mini-Flex XRD system from Rigaku was used for X-ray
diffraction (XRD) measurements. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
was carried out using the Phillips-CM 200 electron microscope operated
at 200 kV. FTIR measurements were carried out using FTIR spectrometer
model Tensor II from Bruker. Particle size and zeta potential were
measured using particle size analyzer model Litesizer 500 from Anton
Paar. XPS measurements were conducted on MULTILAB (Thermo VG Scientific)
using Al Kα radiation as monochromator.
