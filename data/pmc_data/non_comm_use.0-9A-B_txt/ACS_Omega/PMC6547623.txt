The
demand for safer design and synthesis of gold nanoparticles
(AuNPs) is on the increase with the ultimate goal of producing clean
nanomaterials for biological applications. We hereby present a rapid,
greener, and photochemical synthesis of gold nanoplates with sizes
ranging from 10 to 200 nm using water-soluble quercetin diphosphate
(QDP) macromolecules. The synthesis was achieved in water without
the use of surfactants, reducing agents, or polymers. The edge length
of the triangular nanoplates ranged from 50 to 1200 nm. Furthermore,
the reduction of methylene blue was used to investigate the catalytic
activity of AuNPs. The catalytic activity of triangular AuNPs was
three times higher than that of the spherical AuNPs based on kinetic
rate constants (k). The rate constants were 3.44
× 10–2 and 1.11 × 10–2 s–1 for triangular and spherical AuNPs, respectively.
The X-ray diffraction data of gold nanoplates synthesized by this
method exhibited that the nanocrystals were mainly dominated by (111)
facets which are in agreement to the nanoplates synthesized by using
thermal and chemical approaches. The calculated relative diffraction
peak intensity of (200), (220), and (311) in comparison with (111)
was found to be 0.35, 0.17, and 0.15, respectively, which were lower
than the corresponding standard values (JCPDS 04-0784). For example,
(200)/(111) = 0.35 compared to 0.52 obtained from the standard (JCPDS
04-0784), indicating that the gold nanoplates are dominated by (111)
facets. The calculated lattice from selected area electron diffraction
data of the as-synthesized and after 1 year nanoplates was 4.060 and
4.088 Å, respectively. Our calculations were found to be in agreement
with 4.078 Å for face-centered cubic gold (JCPDS 04-0784) and
literature values of 4.07 Å. The computed QDP–Au complex
demonstrated that the reduction process took place in the B ring of
QDP. This approach contributes immensely to promoting the ideals of
sustainable nanotechnology by eradicating the use of hazardous and
toxic organic solvents.

1 Introduction
The synthesis of gold nanotriangles is an exciting research area
because of the unique optical, magnetic, and electrical properties.
These properties have proved to be strongly dependent on size, shape,
and morphology of the nanoparticles.1−6 In recent years, different shapes of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)
have been reported including nanospheres, nanotriangles, nanocubes,
nanorods, nanowires, nanobelts, rectangular, and nanoplates.7−19 Emphases have been directed toward adopting better synthetic methods
which can be used to fine-tune the size and shape of AuNPs to enhance
these unique properties including the use of them as sensing devices
for cyanide.20 Notable synthetic approaches
have been adopted including chemical, electrochemical, and physical
methods. However, the chemical methods require the use of organic
reducing agents, such as NaBH4, which are toxic. Furthermore,
the formation of uniform and controlled shape of AuNPs is normally
achieved by using capping and stabilizing agents, such as cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide, although it is very toxic and hence affects the environment.
Photochemical methods have been used successfully in the synthesis
of AuNPs with interesting shapes.9−19 Recent research has shown that naturally derived flavonoids acted
as reducing, capping, and stabilizing agents in the synthesis of nanoparticles.21−24

Gold nanoplates have been synthesized using different approaches
such as thermal-controlled techniques,25,26 use of polymers,27,28 and surfactants as well as using reducing organic ligands.29−31,32a However, high heat energy is
generally required to attain the Au nanoplates. For example, the synthesis
of gold nanoplates was reported to have been attained by carrying
the reaction in a water bath at 196 °C for 18 min.32b Studies have reported the synthesis of gold
nanoplates using biological33,34 and plant-mediated
approaches.35 Starch-mediated gold triangular
nanoplates of 200 nm size were successfully synthesized in the presence
of sunlight.36 Furthermore, biological
synthesis of single crystalline gold nanoplates has been reported.37

In this study, we were able to integrate
principles of green chemistry
in the synthesis of AuNPs by using a suitable solvent such as water;
nontoxic reducing, capping, and stabilizing agent; and less energy.
The ultimate goals of green chemistry are always attained by adopting
the 12 fundamental principles of green chemistry which include avoidance
of toxic solvents and reagents, minimizing toxic waste, elimination
of unnecessary steps, and minimization of energy usage.38 It is important to note that the green and sustainable
synthesis of nanoparticles should aim at using environmentally benign
solvents such as water, renewable materials, nonoxic chemicals,39 and adopting synthetic protocols that require
less energy, thereby reducing the cost of production.40,41 Again in our protocol, we are using water as the solvent to dissolve
our modified quercetin molecule and using sunlight as the energy source
for the formation of the nanoparticles. The synthesis of metal alloy
nanoparticles with emphasis on environmentally-benign approach by
using water as a solvent, glucose as reducing agent and starch as
protecting agent has been reported.42 We
are reporting for the first time an economical and eco-friendly photochemical
synthesis of gold nanoplates using quercetin diphosphate (QDP) macromolecules
in the presence of sunlight. Although, literature indicates that the
photochemical synthesis of spherical AuNPs and nanorods has been successfully
attained. This synthesis was achieved by using an organic surfactant,
sodium dodecylsulfonate, as the protective agent.43

We hereby report the synthesis of gold nanoplates
by the reduction
of Au3+ ions to Au0 using QDP in the presence
of sunlight for 55 min and using only water as a solvent without using
organic solvents, capping agents, or stabilizing agents, thereby promoting
the ideals of green chemistry and sustainable nanotechnology. Starch-mediated
photochemical synthesis of gold nanoplates has been achieved by carrying
out a reaction of starch and gold(III) chloride in the presence of
sunlight for 5 days.36 In our synthetic
protocol, QDP acted as both reducing and capping agent in the presence
of sunlight to produce gold triangular nanoplates with well-refined
edges. These have the potential to be used in the surface-enhanced
Raman spectroscopy detection platform, catalysis, and electronic and
photonic applications. We have demonstrated from the computed density
functional theory (DFT) calculations that QDP–Au complex with
the lowest energy required for the complexation reaction of QDP and
Au to take place in the B ring between the 3-OH and 4′-phosphate
group.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis
and Characterization of Gold Nanoplates
In this work, the
use of sunlight to provide energy for the synthesis
of gold nanoplates was explored. In Figure 1a(B–D), samples were exposed to sunlight
for 2, 11, and 55 min, respectively, and the color changes that occurred
depicted the formation of AuNPs.

Figure 1 (a) (A) UV–vis spectra of the formation
of gold nanoplates
when 4.5 × 10–4 M HAuCl4 were reacted
with 5 × 10–3 M QDP in a mole ratio of 1:1,
1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:6, and 1:8 for P, Q, R, S, T, and U, respectively,
and then all of the samples were exposed to direct sunlight for 55
min. Pictogram showing color changes when the reaction was carried
out in the presence of sunlight for 2 (B), 11 (C), and 55 min (D).
(b) TEM images showing the morphology of Au nanoplates (A–F)
of gold nanoplates formed after 55 min from samples P, Q, R, S, T,
and U, respectively. EDS spectrum showing the formation of AuNPs obtained
from QDP (G).

The UV–vis spectrum,
as shown in Figure 1a(A), clearly demonstrates the shift in absorption
band and the red shift from 550 to around 760 nm. The intensity of
absorption band at NIR increased steadily with an increase in concentration
of QDP when exposed to sunlight for 55 min. Concentration of QDP influenced
the size and morphology of the gold nanoplates, which is in agreement
with literature studies.34,37

Increase in irradiation
time led to increase in nanoparticle sizes
as demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images in Figures 1b and S3 in the Supporting Information section. It has been established
that the optical properties of nanoparticles depend entirely on size
and shape. The UV–vis spectrum in Figure 1a(A),b(A) clearly demonstrates the anisotropic
nature of the gold nanoplates. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS) [Figure 1b(G)]
confirmed the formation of gold nanoplates. The formation of two surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peaks is more pronounced after 90 min than
after 55 min. According to Mie theory,55,56 spherical
nanoparticles only exhibit one SPR band, whereas anisotropic nanoparticles
may show two or three SPR bands based on the shape of the nanoparticles.
The concentration of QDP influenced the morphology of the gold nanoplates
with average edge lengths ranging from 73 to 1200 nm.57 The nanoplates exhibited sharp edges with increase in concentration
of QDP and sunlight exposure time. An absorption band at around 550
and 745–849 nm was observed for the nanoplates (Figure 2). Blue shift in SPR peaks
of band 1 from 550 to 529 nm, whereas the second band exhibited a
red shift from 700 to 849 nm. The TEM analysis (Figure 2) shows the morphology of hexagonal gold
nanostructures. Large nanoprisms are also observed. TEM images clearly
demonstrate the sintering of nanoparticles coupled by their adherence
to nanoprisms. This observation was also reported in literature.58Figure 2 shows blunt-angled nanoprisms, and this could be mainly attributed
to the fact that nanoprisms possess high energy and hence suffers
a shrinking process which leads to the formation of blunt edges to
reduce the surface energy.59 The experimental
results reveal that by increasing the sunlight exposure time, large
nanoplates with different sizes and shapes will be obtained, as shown
in Figure 2, which
agree very well with the nanoplates formed by other methods.60,61

Figure 2 (A)

4.5 × 10–4 M HAuCl4 was reacted
with 5 × 10–3 M QDP in mole ratios of 1:1,
1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:6, and 1:8 for P, Q, R, S, T, and U, respectively,
and exposed direct sunlight for 90 min. TEM images showing morphology
of Au nanoplates (B–I), whereas the pictorial color changes
depicted by (J,K).

In dark conditions, AuNPs
were not formed even after a period of
10 days.

No color change was observed; thus, it could be deduced
that sunlight
(light energy) plays a significant role in the formation of gold nanoplates.
This is in agreement to the literature report.36

Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to confirm
the crystalline
nature of gold nanoplates, as depicted by the XRD pattern in Figure 3A. Four peaks observed
at 2θ = 38.29°, 44.51°, 64.80°, and 77.70°
can be assigned to (111), (200), (220), and (311) planes, respectively,
for face-centered cubic (fcc) which represents the characteristic
diffraction of elemental gold metal (Au0) (JCPDS 04-0784),
thereby confirming the formation of crystalline AuNPs.

reduction of Au3+ by QDP (A), SAED pattern of gold nanoplates
(B), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) of gold nanoplates (C), and model
of fcc gold nanotriangle in (220) orientations (D).

Furthermore, relative diffraction peak intensity
of (200), (220),
and (311) in comparison with (111) determined to be 0.35, 0.17, and
0.15, respectively. The calculated values are lower than the corresponding
standard values (JCPDS 04-0784). For example, (200)/(111) = 0.35 compared
to 0.52 obtained from the standard (JCPDS 04-0784), thereby depicting
that the gold nanoplates are majorly dominated by (111) facets. Hence,
the (111) planes tend to be preferentially oriented parallel to the
surface of the substrate.24,28 From our results, it
can be deduced that the nanoplates are majorly composed of (111) lattice
planes which are in agreement with literature reports of XRD characterization
of gold nanoplates synthesized by chemical and thermal processes.4,24,26,28,33,37 Literature
reports indicate that the formation of nanoplates with preferential
(111) facets may be attributed to lower free energy of (111) planes
relative to other planes such as (200), (222), and (311).44 The selected area electron diffraction (SAED)
pattern which depicted highly oriented (111) crystalline lattice (Figure 3B) was used to calculate
a lattice constant of 4.060 Å which is in agreement with 4.078
Å for the fcc gold (JCPDS 04-0784). The calculated lattice constant
is also in agreement with the lattice constant of 4.070 Å calculated
from the XRD analysis of hexagonal and triangular gold nanoplates,
synthesized from the chemical method using organic dye molecules.61Figure 3C demonstrates that the growth of the nanoplate was predominantly
along the (111) plane. The results from XRD data were used to model
the nanotriangles based on (111), (200), (220), and (311) orientations.
The crystal maker software was used to generate fcc models by using
a d-spacing of 0.228 nm; nanotriangles generated based on Bragg’s
reflection indices (111), (200), (220), and (311), as shown in Figure 3D.

Figure 4A–C
shows TEM images of the gold nanoplates of sample S in which the mole
ratio of Au3+/QDP was 1:6, left in sunlight for 90 min,
and the sample was kept for 1 year.

Figure 4 Typical TEM images [(A–C) taken
after 1 year] of gold nanoplates
obtained from reduction of Au3+ by QDP in the ratio of
1:6 for 90 min and stored for 1 year and SAED pattern of gold nanoplates
(D).

The nanoplates were hexagonal,
triangular, and irregular spheres
and truncated triangles (Figure 4A–C). The lattice constant of gold nanoplates
determined from the SAED pattern with very bright spots (Figure 4D) taken after 1
year was found to be 4.088 Å which was close to the standard
lattice constant of 4.078 Å (JCPDS 04-0784). The control experiment
was carried out at room temperature (Figure 5) to validate the results of the effect of
sunlight. The results from Figure 5 demonstrate that the AuNPs formed exhibited smaller
sizes clearly demonstrating that the gold nanoplates could only be
formed in the presence of sunlight possibly because of rapid radical
formation, leading to faster reaction between the gold(III) chloride
complex and QDP. The UV–vis spectrum (Figure 5A) shows the change from isotropic to anisotropic
from sample A to D, which is supported by TEM (Figure 4B–G) images being transformed from
spherical to nanoprisms. An increase in the concentration of QDP at
room temperature led to an increase in the number of nanoprisms with
higher number of hexagonals compared to triangular AuNPs.

2.2 Comparison
of Catalytic Activity of Spherical
and Triangular Nanoparticles
The reduction of methylene blue
(MB) is commonly evaluated to test the catalytic activity of metallic
nanoparticles because the reduction of MB can be easily monitored
using UV–vis absorption.62,63 The addition of AuNPs
and excess of 32 mM NaBH4 into MB solution at room temperature
produced a color change from blue to colorless. MB exhibits a peak
maxima at 658 nm, which corresponds to n−π* transition
and a shoulder at 614 nm (Figure 6D).62,64 In the presence of NaBH4 alone, the reaction takes an extensive amount of time to react,
which can be shown by the observation of the absorption band at 658
nm (Figure 6C). The
absorbance peak at 658 nm barely decreases even after 45 min of reaction
time. However, in the presence of a catalyst, MB undergoes reduction
to form leucomethylene blue (Figure 6A,B), and the MB absorption peak at 664 nm decreases
rapidly. The catalytic activity, as measured by the value of the activation
energy, correlates with the fraction of surface atoms. Research has
found out that anisotropic nanoparticles have more surface atoms located
on the corners, edges, and crystallographic facets.57 This idea explains why there is a higher catalytic activity
of triangular nanoparticles compared to spherical nanoparticles.

Figure 6 Time-dependent
UV–vis absorption spectra of the reduction
of MB by NaBH4 in the presence of spherical (A) and triangular
AuNPs (B). Time-dependent UV–vis absorption spectra of the
reduction of MB by NaBH4 in the absence of AuNPs (C). UV–vis
response of MB (D). Plot of ln(At/A0) as a function of time for
the reaction catalyzed by spherical and triangular AuNPs (E).

The mechanism of how the nanoparticles
work as a catalyst has been
described previously.65 Na+ and
BH4– will dissociate in solution from
one another. Therefore, BH4– will act
as a donor in the reduction process. We know then that MB will act
as an acceptor because the nanoparticles in solution will not. Therefore,
since no reduction occurs without the nanoparticle catalysts, it can
be thought that the nanoparticles accept the electrons easily from
BH4– and then transfer the electrons
to MB to cause the reduction process to occur catalytically.65

Because this reaction was conducted under
a large excess of NaBH4, the reaction rate will be considered
to be independent of
the NaBH4 concentration, and consequently the kinetics
can be modeled by a quasi-first-order process with respect to the
concentration of MB.62 Therefore, the rate
constant for the reduction processes was determined by measuring the
change in absorbance at the operational wavelength as a function of
time. Figure 6E depicts
the plot of ln(At/A0) as a function of reaction time (t) for both spherical and triangular AuNPs. At and A0 are the
absorption intensities at 658 nm at time t and 0,
respectively. The kinetic rate constants (k) were
calculated to be 3.44 × 10–2 and 1.11 ×
10–2 s–1 for triangular and spherical
AuNPs, respectively. This confirms that the catalytic activity of
triangular AuNPs is greater than spherical AuNPs. In fact, our results
suggest that the catalytic activity is over three times higher than
that of spherical AuNPs.

The shape of nanoparticles and their
catalytic activity have been
studied extensively in recent years. Gangapuram et al. synthesized
AuNPs from Annona squamosa L peel extract.
The nanoparticles synthesized had an average size of 5 ± 2 nm
and were spherical.64 The rate constant
was found to be 0.038 s–1 at room temperature against
MB.64 Gangapuram et al. also synthesized
5–20 nm spherical AuNPs using Salmalia malabarica gum.65,66 The catalytic activity was tested for these
nanoparticles against MB as well. The rate constant found in this
experiment was 0.00402 s–1.65 Chowdhury et al. showed that synthesizing an alloy nanoparticle
of gold and palladium can increase the catalytic activity.67 The shape of the nanoparticle was hexagonal
with a range of 11–30 nm in size, however. These particles
had a rate constant of 0.230 s–1 for the reduction
of MB.67 Shaik et al. tested the catalytic
activity of Au triangular nanoplates versus spherical nanoparticles
inside of mesoporous hollow silica shells.68 The rate constants for the two nanoparticles were 2.6 × 10–3 and 1.03 × 10–3 s–1. This is worth noting because triangular nanoparticles were close
to 2.5 times as effective compared to spherical nanoparticles.68 In our study, the triangular nanoparticles were
slightly over three times as effective in comparison with the spherical
nanoparticles that were synthesized. The catalytic activity that was
found in this work was close to what has been previously published.68

2.3 Computational Analysis
of QDP Conformers
Figure 7 illustrates
the lowest energy conformation of the QDP monomer. Favorable hydrogen
bonding (noncovalent) interactions between the partial positive hydrogen
from the phosphate group stabilize this conformer (P=O–H
distance 1.78 Å, C=O–H distance 1.59 Å). The
two phosphate groups exist in either above or below the QDP monomer.
However, they cannot be on one side simultaneously. This is because
of the electrostatic repulsion created on one side of the molecule.
It should be noted that up to seven different conformers (Figure S1) lie within 1.5 kcal/mol of each other.
This is a result of the orientation of the phosphate groups; hence,
several structures are easily accessible as presented in the Supporting Information (Figure S1). Several complexations
of gold and QDP were suggested and computed, and Figure 8 shows the lowest possible
conformer where gold interacts with the phosphate group and hydroxyl
group in ring B. Other conformers that are higher in energy are presented
in the Supporting Information (Figure S2).
Furthermore, interactions between gold and hydroxyl groups were found
to be much higher in energy. Interestingly, another structure similar
to conformer 1 was generated from the rotation of the phosphate group
in ring B (conformer F). This conformer was found to have two phosphate
groups on the same side, and an increase of 0.5 kcal/mol in energy
was observed.

Figure 7 (A) Optimized structures of the QDP monomer at the B3LYP/6-31G**
level of theory with selected distances in angstroms. All energies
(kcal/mol) are computed at the B3LYP/6-31G** level of theory and are
related to conformer 1. (B) Lowest possible conformations of the QDP
compound elucidated from NMR characterization.

Figure 8 (A) Optimized structures of the QDP–gold monomer at the
B3LYP-D3/SDD (Au)--6-31+G** (H, C, O, and P) level of theory with
selected distances in angstroms. All energies (kcal/mol) are computed
relative to conformer 1A. (B) Lowest possible conformations of the
QDP complex with gold.

The computed QDP–Au complex demonstrated that the
lowest
energy required for complexation with Au took place in the B ring
between the 3-OH and 4′-phosphate group, as depicted in Figure 8.

The main
difference between conformer 1A and F is that the latter
lacks hydrogen bonding between the phosphate group and hydroxyl groups
in ring B (Figure S2).

3 Conclusions
We have synthesized gold nanoplates using water-soluble
QDP in
the presence of sunlight. This is a clear demonstration of green synthesis
of gold nanoplates by using environmentally safe reducing and capping
agents. This is the first green synthesis we have attained because
the choice of water-soluble QDP acted as reducing and capping agents
and sunlight as the source of energy. The catalytic activity of triangular
AuNPs was three times higher than that of the spherical AuNPs based
on kinetic rate constants (k) of 3.44 × 10–2 and 1.11 × 10–2 s–1 for triangular and spherical AuNPs, respectively.

4.2 Synthesis of QDP
The synthesis of
QDP followed the procedure we reported in literature,45 and the solubility of QDP in water increased 32-fold over
parent quercetin.

4.3 Instrumentation
UV–vis absorption
spectra were carried out on a HP 8453 UV–visible diode array
spectrophotometer. TEM analysis of AuNPs was carried out by adding
a drop of samples to the carbon-coated copper grid and then dried.
TEM measurements were carried out on a JEOL TEM 2100F. The TLC analyses
were performed using 0.25 mm EM Silica Gel 60 F250 plates visualized
by UV irradiation (254 nm). Flash chromatography CombiFlash Companion/TS
model serial 207L20329, Teledyne Isco, Inc. was used for the purification

4.4 Computational Methods
Stationary
points of the QDP compound were optimized and characterized by frequency
analysis using hybrid DFT (B3LYP)46,47 and the 6-31G**48−50 basis set, as implemented in Gaussian 98.51 Enthalpies, ΔH°298, and free energies,

continuum model with a permittivity of acetonitrile, the solvent used
in the experiments. These calculations involve the solvation model
PCM52 as implemented in Gaussian 98. Stability
analyses were performed in addition to analytical frequency calculations
on all stationary points to ensure that geometries correspond to local
minima (all positive eigenvalues). All reported energies are corrected
for zero-point vibrational energy, whereas free energies are quoted
at 298.15 K and 1 atm.

Starting with the initial B3LYP/6-31G**

using a Stuttgart basis set53 SDD which
was employed for gold and the Pople basis set54 6-31+G** was used for all other atoms. A polarizable continuum model
for the organic reaction solvent (acetonitrile) was also applied during
optimizations.55

4.5 Photochemical
Synthesis of Gold Nanoparticles
In atypical experiment, 4.5
× 10–4 M HAuCl4 was reacted with
5 × 10–3 M QDP in
mole ratios of 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:6, and 1:8 for P, Q, R, S, T,
and U, respectively. Then, all of the samples were exposed to direct
sunlight for 55 min. A repeat of reactions of P, Q, R, S, and T were
exposed to sunlight for 90 min to investigate the effect of exposure
time on the morphology of gold nanoplates. Control experiment using
the same concentration setup for P, Q, R, S, and T was conducted in
a dark room. The effect of concentration of QDP on the formation of
AuNPs was investigated by reacting 5 × 10–3 M HACl4·3H2O with 5 × 10–3 M QDP in mole ratios of 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4 for A, B, C, and
D, respectively.

4.6 Reduction of MB Catalyzed
by AuNPs
The catalytic ability of spherical and triangular
AuNPs was evaluated
using a standard MB reduction reaction. The same procedure was followed
as Kariuki et al.62 Three reactions were
set up and monitored using UV–visible spectrophotometer in
the visible region. All of the reactions contained 1 mL of MB (1 ×
10–4 M) and an excess of 32 mM NaBH4.
The first setup was for the determination of reduction potential of
the NaBH4 by itself. The second setup involved the addition
of 300 μL of spherical AuNPs (5 × 10–5 M). The third setup involved the addition of 300 μL triangular
AuNPs (5 × 10–5 M). The timing of each reaction
did vary. The first setup was monitored for 45 min, the second setup
was monitored for 4 min, and the third setup was only monitored for
2 min. The last two setups were only analyzed for such a short time
because of the catalytic ability of the AuNPs added to the reaction
mixture.
