In this work, we
developed a CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite
solar cell with CuInS2 quantum dot-modified TiO2 nanoarrays (TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NAs) as
a scaffold layer. Based on the suitable device configuration, we achieved
improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.3%, which was 38.3%
higher than that of the device without QD modification (8.2%). After
exposure to air for 30 days, the TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NA-based device possessed a PCE of 5.4%, being 41% of
the original performance, which was far superior to that of TiO2 nanoarray-based solar cells with a PCE of 1.1%. Our results
showed that the crystallinity of perovskite, surface state, and interface
for charge transport of TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NA-based
perovskites all remarkably improved, indicating the improved air stability
for TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NA-based solar cells.

Introduction
Recently, metal halide perovskites
have been recognized to be most outstanding photoelectric materials
due to their special performances1−5 including the well-matched optical band gap,1 prominent charge diffusion lengths,6 low
fabrication property,7 very low temperature
processability,8 and high light absorbance.9 This aroused great enthusiasm among scientific
researchers for the rapid enhancement of power conversion efficiency
(PCE). Nowadays, tremendous efforts have been made by various engineering
techniques such as a crystal culture method,10−12 element modification,13 interfacial modification,14−16 and the application of effective carrier-transport
materials,8,17,18 propelling
the PCE to reach a high value up to 20%.19−25

However, the poor stability remains to be the major obstacle
in the potential commercialization of perovskite photovoltaic devices.
The hybrid perovskite material is found to be easy to decompose into
PbI2 and volatile organic groups under moisture corrosion,
photo-oxidation, and a high-temperature environmental due to the instability
of the weak bonding effect.26−28 Interfacial modification and controlling have been known as one
of the key methods for enhancing stability in hybrid perovskite solar
cells.29−31

Herein,
we improved the iodine-based hybrid perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3)/electron transport material
(ETM) interface using TiO2 nanoarrays (TiO2-NAs)
embellished with chalcopyrite CuInS2 quantum dots (CuInS2 QDs), which have been considered as excellent photovoltaic
materials due to high light absorbance (ca. 105 cm–1), suitable band gap (ca. 1.6 eV), and low toxicity.32 These have been applied in some fields such
as polymer-based photovoltaic devices,33 ternary hybrid devices,34 and perovskite-based
solar cells.35,36 In our recent research, TiO2 nanoarrays decorated with CuInS2 QDs (TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NAs) were fabricated to be applied
in MAPbI3 solar cells. These TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NAs are found to be advanced interfacial ETMs, which can
effectively improve the stability of hybrid MAPbI3-based
solar cells. The results show that the crystallinity of perovskite,
surface state, and interface for charge transport of TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NA-based perovskites all remarkably
improved in fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO)/TiO2–CuInS2 QDs/MAPbI3/spiro-MeOTAD/Au solar cells. Additionally,
we observed that the TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NA-based
devices greatly improved air stability compared to that of the pure
TiO2-NA-based MAPbI3 solar cells.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1a shows the absorption spectrum of CuInS2 QDs, which shows wide absorption in the region from 300 to
800 nm, indicating their excellent light absorption properties in
the whole ultraviolet–visible region. Coincided with chalcopyrite
CuInS2, the absorption band gap of as-synthesized CuInS2 QDs was calculated to be about 1.75 eV, which matches well
with the energy band gap requirements.37 The TiO2-NAs show a wide shoulder in the region of 300–360
nm, which is in good agreement with the previous work (Figure 1b).38 The strong peak at the wavelength of 310 nm is based on Ti (3d)–O
(2p) energy transition of TiO2 nanoarrays.38Figure 1c shows the absorption spectra of MAPbI3 films coated
on TiO2 nanoarrays and TiO2–CuInS2 QD array films. Both TiO2-NAs/MAPbI3 and TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NAs/MAPbI3 exhibit two bands at about 480 and 760 nm (Figure S1), for which the optical transition of MAPbI3 should
be responsible.39 Obviously, the absorption
intensity of the TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NAs/MAPbI3 is enhanced compared to that of the TiO2-NAs/MAPbI3 sample, which can be explained by two aspects. on the one
hand, the wide absorption response of CuInS2 QDs can add
to the absorption intensity of the films. On the other hand, the fine
crystal changes of the MAPbI3 on TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NAs (X-ray diffraction (XRD) data discussed in Figure 6) should be responsible
for the higher absorption intensity. The XRD patterns of chalcopyrite
CuInS2 QDs, TiO2 nanoarrays, and QD-modified
TiO2 nanoarrays are shown in Figure 1d. From the XRD patterns, we can see that
the chalcopyrite CuInS2 QD peaks recorded at 2θ =
28, 47, and 55° are attributed to the (112), (220), and (312)
diffraction crystal planes, respectively (JCPDS card #86-0147).40 To further study the CuInS2 QDs,
we measured the size of as-synthesized CuInS2 QDs by Scherrer’s
formula. The average size of the CuInS2 QDs was estimated
to be 1–3 nm, consistent with that of the pure particles in
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) data (Figure S2). It can be clearly seen in the TiO2-NA patterns
that three diffraction peaks attributed to (101), (211), and (002),
respectively, appeared, which is in good agreement with the rutile
TiO2 crystal marked by JCPDS card #21-1276.40 Different from TiO2-NAs, the new
(112) peak originated from the chalcopyrite CuInS2 QDs
in TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NA samples, suggesting
the successful crystallization of CuInS2 QDs on the TiO2 nanoarray substrate. The crystal growth direction is easily
implied to be preferential along the [112] direction.

signals of FTO. The inset in (a) is the optical energy band gap curve
of CuInS2 QDs.

Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained to study the nanoscale
surface morphologies and the interfacial state of the TiO2-NA and QD-modified TiO2-NA samples. The pure TiO2-NAs (Figures 2a, S3a, and S3b) are highly unique nanorods
with average diameters of 40–50 nm and corresponding lengths
of 500 nm. The selected electron diffraction patterns (SEDPs) of the
as-synthesized TiO2-NAs are displayed in Figure 2b, which are in quite agreement
with those of the rutile TiO2 samples. Figures 2c, S3c, and S3d show the SEM and TEM images of TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NAs. Clearly, the CuInS2 QDs evenly dispersed
on the surface of TiO2-NAs with a size of 3–5 nm,
which was slightly larger than that of the pure CuInS2 QDs,
for which the effect of the surface energy of TiO2-NAs
should be responsible. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HR-TEM) image of TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NAs
is displayed in Figure 2d. CuInS2 QDs are clearly visible with an interplanar
spacing of 0.25 nm, matching well with the (101) plane of the rutile
TiO2.40 The thickness of the
CuInS2 QD layer in the QD-modified TiO2-NAs
was calculated to be 6.5 nm, which is almost 2 QDs in length.

The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the MAPbI3 thin
films on FTO, TiO2-NAs, and TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NAs were investigated to confirm charge transfer behavior
of CuInS2 QDs (Figure 3a). The pure MAPbI3 thin films on FTO showed
a wide band located at 775 nm, which agrees well with the previous
work.40 The emission band was significantly
quenched after coating
of MAPbI3 on the TiO2-NA substrate, suggesting
that an efficient charge transport channel existed between the MAPbI3 and TiO2-NA interface. What is more, the quenching
intensity was remarkably enhanced when MAPbI3 contacted
with TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NAs, implying the
facilitated electron injection efficiency at the interface between
the MAPbI3 layer and TiO2-NAs. Time-resolved
photoluminescence spectrum was further recorded to test the charge
transfer time (τCT), which can be calculated by the
formula 1/τfilm = 1/τMAPbI3 + 1/τCT, where τfilm is
the decay lifetime of MAPbI3 films on the ETM substrate
and 1/τMAPbI3 is the decay lifetime of
pure MAPbI3 films. As shown in Table S1, the τMAPbI3 of the pure MAPbI3 films was tested and estimated to be 42 ns, by which the
τfilm and τCT for TiO2-NAs/MAPbI3 thin films were calculated to be 11.0 and
14.9 ns, respectively. In comparison, the τfilm and
τCT in TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NAs/MAPbI3 were calculated to be 6.2 and 7.3 ns, which are much shorter
than those of TiO2-NAs/MAPbI3 thin films, indicating
that an improved charge transfer process occurred at the TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NA and MAPbI3 interface.

Figure S4 shows the cross section of solar
cells. The corresponding device structure and energy-level diagram
are displayed in Figure 4a,b, respectively. The J–V curve data of TiO2-NA-based and TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NA-based solar cells are measured in Figure 4c. For the TiO2-NA-based
device, the performance with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.93 V, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 13.4 mA cm–2, and a PCE of 8.2%
was obtained. Compared to those of the solar cells based on TiO2-NAs, the TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NA-based
device showed remarkably improved performance (Table 1), where the Voc and Jsc were 0.98 V and 19.2 mA cm–2, respectively. The highest PCE of such a device was
as high as 13.3%, which was 38.3% higher than that of the TiO2-NA-based device.

TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NAs/MAPbI3	0.98	19.2	0.71	13.3	
The external quantum efficiency (EQE)
spectra of the solar cells are recorded in Figure 4d. All of the devices showed a broad band
in the region from 400 to 800 nm. The response peak at 730 nm can
be attributed to the characteristic absorption of MAPbI3. The TiO2-NA-based device showed the highest EQE of only
62%. In contrast, the most efficient EQE of the TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NA-based solar cell was as high as 95%, much higher than
that of the TiO2-NA-based solar cell. The results indicated
that the QD-modified TiO2 nanoarrays can efficiently facilitate
the charge transport process. To confirm this, we calculated the series
resistance (Rs) using the typical eq 1,41 where the ideal diode behavior (n = 1) is assumed
with IL and I0 representing photocurrent and dark saturation current (inverse polarization),
respectively. Besides, q, T, K, and V correspond to the charge, absolute
temperature, Boltzmann constant, and bias potential, respectively. 1  Rs was estimated to be
2.81 Ω cm2 for the TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NA-based solar cell and 3.74 Ω cm2 for
the TiO2-NA-based solar cell, indicating that the charge
transport behavior is remarkably improved. Thus, the enhancement of
the performance, especially the photocurrent in the TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NA-based solar cell, can be easily understood.

To investigate the stability of the solar cells, we studied the
large-scale surface state of MAPbI3 films under an air
environment for 30 days (Figures 5 and S6). MAPbI3 coated on both TiO2-NA and QD-modified TiO2 nanoarray substrates showed smooth and compact surfaces, indicating
a good crystallization process during annealing. After exposure to
air for 30 days, the MAPbI3 on TiO2-NAs broken
down into small particles with cracks on their surfaces. Compared
to that on TiO2-NAs, MAPbI3 on the TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NAs substrate showed better air stability.
The decomposition degree was greatly reduced with a more regular and
smooth surface, indicating that TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NAs can effectively prevent MAPbI3 from decomposition.

XRD patterns of MAPbI3 films on TiO2-NA and
TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NA substrates were recorded
to further corroborate the SEM results. Figure 6a shows the XRD patterns
of MAPbI3 films on different substrates. For films on the
TiO2-NA substrate, the diffraction peaks at 2θ =
14, 24, 28, 32, 40, and 43° can be assigned to the (110), (202),
(220), (310), (224), and (314) planes of the tetragonal MAPbI3 crystal, respectively.42 Notably,
a new diffraction peak at ca. 36° appeared on TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NA samples that could be assigned to
the (312) crystal plane of MAPbI3.43 This implied that the MAPbI3 crystal was more inclined
to grow along the [312] direction. It should be explained that there
was almost no XRD signal of CuInS2 QDs in the films because
of the very low content of QDs in TiO2–CuInS2-NAs/MAPbI3 films. To study the phase change of
MAPbI3 films on TiO2-NA and QD-modified TiO2-NA substrates in air for 30 days, the corresponding XRD patterns
were recorded (Figure 6b). For further comparison, we obtained the XRD pattern of PbI2. The diffraction peaks at 2θ = 12, 26, 34, and 39°
can be assigned to the (001), (101), (102), and (110) planes, respectively,
of the PbI2 nanocrystal.44 The
XRD pattern of MAPbI3 films on the TiO2-NA substrate
after 30 days showed a sharp peak at 2θ = 12°, which could
be assigned to the (001) plane of the PbI2 nanocrystal,
indicating the decomposition of the MAPbI3 thin film. Interestingly,
the PbI2 diffraction peak intensity of the (001) plane
in MAPbI3 films coated on TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NA substrates was greatly reduced, indicating a more stable
interface between MAPbI3 and CuInS2 QD-modified
TiO2-NAs. Our results suggest that the CuInS2 QD-modified TiO2-NAs can effectively increase the stability
of MAPbI3 films, which was in good agreement with the SEM
data.

Figure 6 (a) XRD patterns of MAPbI3 films on TiO2-NA and TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NA substrates and (b) corresponding XRD patterns after
30 days. The XRD signals of TiO2 and FTO are indicated
by different symbols.

The performances of TiO2-NA-based and TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NA-based solar cells in air for
30 days were characterized (Figure S7 and Table 2). After 30 days in
air, the device based on TiO2-NAs showed a Voc of 0.73 V, a Jsc of 5.7
mA cm–2, and a PCE of 1.1%. In contrast, the corresponding
TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NA-based device exhibited
a Voc of 0.93 V, a Jsc of 10.1 mA cm–2, and a PCE of 5.4%. The
PCE of the TiO2-NA-based device was only 12% of the original
efficiency with a decreased fill factor of 0.27, for which the low
stability of MAPbI3 should be responsible. Fortunately,
the corresponding TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NA-based
device showed better performance, which possessed 41% PCE of the original
device. The results demonstrated that the CuInS2 QD-modified
TiO2-NAs can effectively increase the stability of the
solar cells.

Conclusions
In
summary, solar cells based on CuInS2 QD-modified TiO2 nanoarrays were fabricated in this work. The solar cells
based on TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NAs exhibited
an improved PCE of 13.3%, much higher than that of solar cells using
pure nanoarrays (8.2%). After 30 days in an air environment, the device
based on TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NAs still possessed
a PCE of 5.4%, which was 41% of the original device. The SEM and XRD
results showed that the crystallinity, surface morphology, and interface
for charge transfer of TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NA-based
perovskites all remarkably improved, indicating the improved air stability
of MAPbI3 films on TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NAs. On the basis of this, the CuInS2 QD-modified
nanoarrays provide a novel channel for the preparation of high-performance
and high-stability perovskite devices.

Experimental Section
Characterizations
and Methods
UV–vis absorption spectra were measured
to investigate the absorption properties (Agilent Cary 300). Time-resolved
photoluminescence spectroscopic measurements (the obtained decay data
was fitted by exponential functions with χ2 equal
to 0.9–1.2) and PL spectra of the prepared films were measured
to test the lifetime of the samples (Edinburgh FLS980). The X-ray
diffraction patterns were recorded to measure the crystal characteristics
(D/MAX 2500, Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5405 Å). Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) measurements (Tecnai G2 20 S-TWIN) and scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) measurements (JEOL S-4800) were applied
to test the morphologies of the samples. The MAPbI3 films
were obtained by spin-coating the precursor solution on corresponding
substrates at a speed of 1500 rpm. The films were then annealed at
100 °C for 30 min for further use.

Preparation of TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NAs
The TiO2-NAs were prepared by following
the method in previous literatures.45 First,
a homogeneous solution was prepared in a 250 mL flask with 37% HCl
and deionized water added (VHCl/Vwater = 1:1). The homogeneous solution was then
shifted into a Teflon-lined chemical reaction vessel with impaction
of FTO glass. Afterward, isopropyl titanate (1 mL) was added and
the solution was sonication for 5 min. After heating at 180 °C
for 90 min, the TiO2-NAs/FTO film was obtained, which was
further annealed at 450 °C for 30 min to obtain TiO2-NAs.

The TiO2-NAs/FTO film was modified
under room temperature by soaking into a cysteine solution (3 ×
10–4 M) for at least 3 days, which was then added
into a reaction mixture solution consisting of 60 mL of ethanol solution
with Cu(Ac)2 (0.1 mmol), In(Ac)3 (0.1 mmol),
CH3(CH2)16CH2NH2 (1.2 mmol), and CH4N2S (0.4 mmol).32 The reaction mixture was further heated at 160
°C with a growth time of 9 h to form TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NAs/FTO thin film. The as-synthesized TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NAs/FTO thin film was finally annealed at 450 °C
for 30 min, forming the chalcopyrite CuInS2 QD-coated TiO2-NAs/FTO thin film.

Fabrication
and Characterization of Solar Cells
CH3NH3I was prepared by following a method reported previously.46 Methylamine (ethanol solution, 24 mL, 33%) together
with 10 mL of 57% HI (water solution) was dissolved in 100 mL of absolute
ethanol for at least 2 h in a nitrogen atmosphere to achieve crystallization
of CH3NH3I. After that, 0.463 g of PbI2 and 0.447 g of CH3NH3I (mole ratio 1:3) were
added into 3 mL of dimethylformamide solution to form the CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solution. The precursor solution
was then spin-coated onto the FTO/TiO2–CuInS2 QD-NA thin film (1500 rpm, 40 s). After annealing at 100
°C for 30 min, the MAPbI3 active layer was formed.
Afterward, a spiro-MeOTAD (68 mM) chlorobenzene solution contains tert-butylpyridine (55 mM), and lithium bis(trifluoromethyl-sulfonyl)imide
salt (9 mM) was prepared and spin-coated onto MAPbI3 at
2000 rpm for 40 s. Finally, a device (area of 0.12 cm2)
was prepared by a 200 nm gold depositing onto the spiro-MeOTAD surface.
The current–voltage (J–V) curves were tested under the AM 1.5G spectrum at 100 mW cm–2 (Newport Oriel). The EQE measurement was carried
out to test the insight light–current conversion of devices
using a Qtest station 500 instrument.
