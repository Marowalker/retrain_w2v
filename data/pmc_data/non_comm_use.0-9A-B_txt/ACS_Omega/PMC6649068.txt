results of basic energetics and interacting behavior of hydrogen with
metal hexaboride surfaces using a combination of self-consistent density
functional calculations and dynamics based on the Car–Parrinello
method. Our results show that hydrogen is strongly attracted to localized
exposed boron atoms and interactions with the terminal cations are
strictly repulsive. From these, preliminary local adsorption energy
calculations suggest that a single hydrogen molecule per surface unit-cell
is possible (one ML). Strongest bonds are found when hydrogen is above
the terminal boron atoms affected by reduced coordination and dangling
bonds. This location serves to restore the hexaboride unit to a more
stable structure by providing electronic density to the deficient
surface octahedra. Additionally, trajectories from dynamic simulations
provide insight into how hydrogen recombination reactions occur on
the surface through dissociative adsorption and the method of travel
prior to recombination to be along the octahedral face and bridging
sites connecting separate unit cells on the surface. Upon adsorption,
a single hydrogen atom becomes localized at the dangling bond site
while the second interacts with the surface along a weaker potential
energy path. Desorption at lower temperatures occurs when migrating
atoms from separate adsorption sites intersect to form a new pair.

1 Introduction
Metal hexaboride
(MB6) materials are commonly used as cathodes in electron
optical instruments owing to their low work functions and low evaporation
rates.1 Experimental and theoretical studies
investigating adsorption on MB6 surfaces have mainly focused
on determining the poisoning effects on the emitter planes caused
by common environmental gases such as CO, O2, and H2O.2−13 Although hydrogen is
considered a background gas in ultrahigh vacuum conditions,14 only a handful of studies consider the interaction
of hydrogen with MB6 surfaces and theoretical investigations
are absent from the literature to the best of our knowledge. Most
experimental, modeling, and theoretical efforts are focused on electronic
behavior and thermophysical properties for bulk MB6 materials.15−21

Buckingham22 sought
to determine the effects related to environmental gases, including
hydrogen, on the performance of thermionic cathodes. In contrast with
a majority of the electronegative atmospheric compounds tested, a
positive effect was observed—the background hydrogen was found
to improve the performance of poorly activated cathodes (those requiring
work to promote lanthanum coverage at the emitter tip). Nagaki et
al.23 performed a thorough analysis quantifying
the hydrogen–deuterium recombination reaction using a LaB6 catalyst, suggesting that exposed terminal boron atoms were
probable active sites for this equilibration reaction. This conclusion
was supported by the relatively low turnover rate and generally accepted
hypothesis that most MB6 are metal-terminated. Note that
the catalytic H–B interaction on LaB6 surfaces parallels
the cathode improvement observed by Buckingham, as excess metal on
the surface is generally associated with lower work functions.24 In more current research, MB6 materials
are being investigated as a transient product in hydrogenation reactions
for reversible hydrogen storage.25

Although the experimental publications considering the nature of
interactions between hydrogen and MB6 materials are very
limited in number, each one provides a distinct piece of evidence
to allow for comparison with in silico results. We continue the research
effort by studying energetics, bonding geometries, surface modifications,
and electronic changes associated with hydrogen interactions at different
sites on four MB6 materials. We restrict our focus to the
(001) surfaces of MB6 using stoichiometric slab supercells.
At this point, it is unclear which surface would be most suitable
for the analysis, as most experimental work is unclear on the surface
terminations on metal hexaborides. In agreement with Nagaki et al.,23 we find that hydrogen adsorption is only possible
on MB6 structures presenting accessible boron atoms, with
binding energies as low as −2.316 eV/H. Additionally, we provide
evidence for a possible mechanism explaining the H2–D2 equilibration reported more than 35 years ago.

2 Theoretical Methods
2.1 Surface Geometries
The
bulk unit cell of metal hexaborides is simple cubic with space group Pm3̅m symmetry. A single metal atom
is found on the origin along with six boron atoms, forming an octahedral
unit, whose barycenter is at the (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) location of the unit
cell. The lattice can be fully described using only the lattice constant,
a, and positional parameter, z, as shown in Figure 1. To describe the
(100) surfaces, we use four stoichiometric slabs resulting from a
previous study26 on the stability of various
MB6 terminations. Three of the surfaces have repeating
units which have a depth of one unit-cell along the x-direction, shown in Figure 2 as two-dimensional slices through a slab model. The polar
1 × 1 surface in Figure 2a consists of separate cation-terminated and boron-terminated
faces and is used as a baseline for comparison. Notice that this surface
configuration is ideal in the sense that it shows a complete segregation
of boron and metal ions in a symmetric fashion, but because it is
polar, the metal hexaboride will essentially be in layers of alternating
planes of opposite charge causing what is known as a polar catastrophe.
The electrostatic potential increases with thickness piling up bulk
dipole moments and causing electrostatic divergence. Electrostatic
stability is achieved by surface reconstruction or reorganization
of atoms with charge redistribution accordingly. In other words, other
surface arrangements occur to stabilize the surface. These however
are found to produce the lowest surface energy through electronic
structure calculations at 0 K for alkaline-earth hexaborides.26 The 1 × 2 and 1 × 4 surfaces depicted
in Figure 2b,c, respectively,
terminate with alternating rows of cations and vacancies, and the
1 × 2 structure has been observed experimentally on freshly cleaved
CaB6 single crystals using low-energy electron diffraction.27 The fourth geometry considered has a two-dimensional
repeating unit along the surface plane, and Figure 3 provides two different perspectives for
the 2 × 2 slab. Looking down from the top of the crystal in Figure 3a, a checkerboard
pattern is formed by the surface cations (labeled S). Figure 3b shows a space-filling model
of a three-layer slab after a slight rotation, where parallel rows
formed along the diagonals can be seen.

showing relevant bond lengths. Each unit cell contains one cation
(blue) and six boron atoms (purple) forming an octahedral structure.
The positional parameter, z, is defined as half the
interoctahedral bond distance divided by the lattice constant, a.

surfaces. Each surface of the slab, shown as the portion outside of
the bulk region, repeats in the x-direction with
a single unit-cell periodicity.

the 2 × 2 slabs. (a) Surface
cations, S, viewed from above the (001) face. Faded circles represent
metals below the first layer of boron atoms. (b) Diagonal rows of
terminal cations shown from the side of a small slab supercell.

Each slab supercell
is constructed to contain 15 layers along the surface normal, and
atoms located in the central cells are constrained to their equilibrium
positions during ionic relaxation to act as a bulk reservoir. As previously
established,26 the chosen layer depth has
shown to produce converged results for surface energies and coordinate
relaxations,26 generating surface energies
with standard deviations less than 0.05% using several converged layer
counts. Another important parameter which can substantially alter
the results from electronic structure calculations is the vacuum size
between slab supercells. We separate each surface with a vacuum length
of 25.46 Å for BaB6 (4.2437), 24.87 Å for CaB6 (4.1445), 24.90 Å for LaB6 (4.1501), and
25.16 Å for SrB6 (4.1935), respectively, making the
overall distance along the z-direction equivalent
to a total of 21 bulk unit-cell lengths for each system. The values
in parentheses are the unit cell size of each metal hexaborides in
angstroms. Calculated local adsorption energies, work functions, and
bond lengths are converged to less than 1 meV and 1 pm, respectively.
Additionally, dipole corrections28 are
implemented with the capacitor placed directly in the center of the
vacuum. For a more comprehensive adsorption study of hydrogen in these
materials, one would have to consider the extent of adsorption coverage
by the hydrogen, which is not part of this work. Additionally, larger
supercells are more appropriate to include deformations, defects,
and grain boundaries among other phenomena, but the computational
costs with ab initio-based methods can quickly become prohibitive.
In this work, we focus on providing insights on the hydrogen interactions
on MB6 materials for Ba, Ca, La, and Sr to identify the
potential of the materials for new applications, such as hydrogen
storage, by understanding local mechanisms of interaction.

2.2 Density Functional Theory
Electronic structure calculations, within density functional theory
(DFT), are performed using the integrated suite of open-source computer
codes, QUANTUM ESPRESSO,29 based
upon plane waves and pseudopotentials. Exchange and correlation effects
are described by the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional30 within the generalized gradient approximation.
A Monkhorst–Pack set of special k-points31 and Marzari–Vanderbilt cold smearing32 are used to integrate over the Brillouin-zone.

Ultrasoft pseudopotentials generated through the Vanderbilt scheme33 with nonlinear core corrections are used to
represent the interactions between the ionic core and valence electrons
for all atoms in this work.29 Each of the
alkaline earth metals has 10 valence electrons with 3s23p63d04s2, 4s24p64d15s15p0, and 5s25p65d06s26p0 configurations
for atoms Ca, Sr, and Ba, respectively. Lanthanum contains 11 electrons
in its valence with a 5s25p65d16s1.56p0.5 configuration, and the boron pseudopotential
has three valence electrons in a 2s22p1 configuration.
Kinetic energy cutoffs for the plane wave basis are 30 Ry for the
wave function and 400 Ry for the charge density for all systems, and
these values are converged to 1 mRy/atom using a bulk unit cell energy
calculation. Smearing widths and k-points for each
crystal are determined by monitoring atomic forces after a 10% displacement
of the metal cation in the lattice and selecting values which agree
within 0.001 eV/Å/atom for a dense mesh of k-points (24 × 24 × 24) and low smearing width (1 mRy).
Unit cells for the divalent metal hexaboride systems use a 6 ×
6 × 6 k-point mesh and smearing widths of σCa = 5 mRy, σSr = 5 mRy, and σBa = 10 mRy. In contrast to the alkaline-earth hexaborides in this
study, lanthanum hexaboride is a metallic conductor and requires a
set of parameters more suitable for self-convergence. For LaB6, we use an 8 × 8 × 8 k-point mesh
for the unit cell along with σLa = 20 mRy for electron
smearing. These parameters have been previously tested26 and show good agreement with reported experimental
values in the literature, achieving deviations less than 0.5 and 0.2%
for calculated lattice constants and positional parameters, respectively.
Additionally, bulk moduli are also in good agreement with published
results.

2.3 Car–Parrinello
Dynamics
In an effort to reduce the search space for preferential
binding locations, we perform molecular dynamics simulations using
the Car–Parrinello scheme34 (CPMD)
within DFT. The equations of motion are integrated with a time step
of 7.5 × 10–17 s over the course of 105 steps at a temperature of T = 50 K. Wavefunction
and charge density cutoffs are identical to those for self-consistent
field calculations. We find that an effective electron mass of 200
au (0.10972 amu) and kinetic energy cutoff of 3 Ry are sufficient
to maintain adiabicity and model the system accurately.

Supercells
for CPMD simulations are constructed to have nine unit cells along
the surface normal (z-direction), comprising a five-layer
slab along with four layers of vacuum. Additionally, a minimum of
two unit cell widths is given along the x- and y-directions to mitigate interactions between neighboring
images. Because of the polar nature of the 1 × 1 slabs, both
boron-terminated and metal-terminated surfaces are studied. Additionally,
boron-terminated slabs require the use of passivation on the “bulk”
side to deter H2 molecules from interacting with these
surfaces. For these, we place a single hydrogen atom atop each of
the terminal boron atoms per unit cell. Slabs having 1 × 2, 2
× 2, and 1 × 4 terminations are symmetric by construction
and are therefore simulated without further modification. We perform
two sets of simulations for each slab with two and eight hydrogen
molecules added to the vacuum space.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Preferential Binding Sites
In agreement
with the conclusions drawn by Nagaki et al.,23 we find that metal-terminated regions on the surface of MB6 materials do not contribute toward attractive interactions with
hydrogen. The outermost layer of cations are shown to repel molecular
hydrogen in the molecular dynamics simulations, and these repulsive
interactions are substantial enough to warrant no further analysis
of the metal-terminated 1 × 1 systems in this work. Figure 4 shows sample trajectories
for the hydrogen atoms obtained from CPMD simulations. The scales
on the axis of the figure are arbitrary and are used to summarize
the dynamic trajectories of the hydrogen atoms. The x–y plane represents the metal hexaboride
surface, and the initial positions of the molecular hydrogen are in
the vacuum region in the z-direction. For example,
for the case of molecular hydrogen interacting with a metal-terminated
surface, Figure 4a
shows the trajectory of two hydrogen molecules (four atoms) with initial
positions at the black dots (●) moving toward the x–y plane (the surface) with an arbitrary
impulse. Notice that the hydrogen molecules bounced back from the
surface and become trapped in the vacuum region perpetually rebounding
from metal to metal due to the boundary conditions of the supercell.

Figure 4 Sample

for (a) 1 × 1 metal-terminated slabs (two hydrogen molecules),
(b) 1 × 1 boron-terminated slabs (two hydrogen molecules), and
(c) 1 × 2 slabs having both metal and boron terminations (six
hydrogen molecules). Initial starting points are designated by filled
circles for each atom with initial state as molecular hydrogen. MB6 surfaces at the x–y plane and vacuum in the z-direction, all axes with
arbitrary units of length.

A reduction in the cation concentration at the surface exposes
the octahedra and allows for boron–hydrogen interactions to
occur. Figure 4b displays
the result of a 1 × 1 surface composed entirely of boron. The
two hydrogen molecules shown are rapidly adsorbed, displaying a degree
of migration along the surface for the separate hydrogen atoms clearly
splitting from the original equilibrium molecular structure and bond
distance. An interesting observation from the CPMD is the occurrence
of partner exchange with the adsorbed hydrogen atoms. Figure 4c displays the trajectory of
six H2 molecules during the course of the simulation for
a CaB6 1 × 2 slab. Beginning with the initial locations
for each atom, indicated by paired black circles, each molecule that
binds to the surface results in one atom with a tightly constrained
position and the other having translational freedom. The tightly bound
hydrogen atoms are typically located in the vicinity of the dangling
bond resulting from the cleavage, though some local displacement is
also observed. Trajectories of the mobile atoms follow paths which
avoid terminal cations on the surface, and recombination/desorption
events occur at the intersection of two migrating hydrogens. A similar
effect has been observed in studies on boron-doped graphite surfaces.
While an increased boron concentration produces larger binding energies
for hydrogen, the diffusion barriers and recombination activation
energies decrease accordingly.35 Examination
of the CPMD trajectories suggests the method of travel prior to recombination
to be along the octahedral face and bridging sites connecting separate
unit cells on the surface. The mobile character of adsorbed hydrogen
on the facial sites is also seen36 on the
hexahydro-closo-hexaborate dianion [B6H6]2–, which has an analogous structure
to the metal hexaborides described in this work. These trajectories
show that the chemisorption phenomenon seems to be governing interactions
of hydrogen in nonmetal-terminated regions. The accuracy of the trajectories
can be improved by incorporating van der Waals effects in the calculations
to better describe interactions between nuclei. This work provides
enough evidence that the chemisorption phenomenon occurs, where vdW
forces are not as relevant than for the case of physisorption or molecular
diffusion of hydrogen.

Figure 5 illustrates possible binding locations for single
and molecular hydrogen on the surface of boron-terminated hexaborides.
The left panel is for binding sites of single hydrogen atoms (three
positions, namely, “on-top”, “bridging”,
and “face central”, respectively), whereas the right
panel describes potential binding sites for two hydrogen atoms or
multiatom adsorption. For example, the difference between “on-top”
and “top/face” is the addition of the second hydrogen
atom at the “face central” position. The most stable
adsorption sites for single hydrogen atoms, as evaluated by the residence
time in CPMD simulations, are shown on the left portion of Figure 5 for boron-terminated
regions of the surfaces. For the case of multiatom adsorption, we
have also included the combinations “top/face” and “top/bridge”,
as shown on the right portion of Figure 5. The “face/bridge” combination
is initially included; however, the hydrogen atom located in the face
site invariably switches to the top position upon relaxation of the
ionic coordinates. An additional configuration in the lower right
of Figure 5 named “bisect”
is also investigated to compare with the σ complexes associated
with metal-catalyzed reactions.37

atom (left panel) and molecular hydrogen (right panel) adsorption
on metal hexaboride surfaces. Each position is shown for a boron-terminated
region on the surface of the slab.

3.2 Geometric Effects
A consequence of hydrogen local dissociation and adsorption on these
surfaces is that hydrogen-induced dereconstruction is observed on
the terminal octahedra in many cases. While it is typical for the
outermost hexaboride unit to contract by 20–25% of the bulk
distance along the surface normal,26 this
effect is mitigated with hydrogen chemisorption when atoms located
in the “on-top” position are present. Similar dereconstructions
caused by hydrogen adsorption have been observed for other materials.38 These expansions are described in Table 1 using the parameter ΔBzσ, defined as 1  where Bz,posσ is the z-coordinate (normal to the
surface) of the boron atom in either the top or bottom position (pos)
in the first layer of the surface σ. This boron–boron
distance is normalized by its bulk equilibrium value 2  for the lattice constant, a, and positional parameter, z. Aside from the LaB6 1 × 2 and 2 ×
2 slabs, significant expansions are observed upon hydrogen adsorption.
One possibility for the strange behavior of LaB6 is that
these surfaces are more stable and thus less likely to accept a hydrogen
atom because the 1 × 2 slab results in the lowest surface energy
for LaB6.

a Relative distances between top and bottom boron atoms located in
the first layer for clean and adsorbed surfaces (see eq 1). Only octahedra which have a hydrogen
attached in the “on-top” position or their locations
on the clean surface are considered here.

For the other cases, it is hypothesized
that the increased charge density upon formation of the sigma H–B
bond reduces the stress caused by cleavage, placing the affected boron
atoms in a more bulk-like environment. Some insight into this effect
can be gained by analyzing the bonding charge density. For the reaction 3  where Nz is the layer depth through the
slab between the top and bottom surfaces, charge densities are calculated
for the final relaxed state and the two initial states, resulting
in three separate density data sets. The initial coordinates for the
clean slab and hydrogen atom are taken from the final relaxed system
to allow for direct comparison between the two states. Removal of
the initial adsorbate and surface charge densities from the final
relaxed geometry produces the bonding charge density. Although this
method does not use the geometry of the relaxed clean surface, it
does help in producing a qualitative picture of the charge redistribution
accompanying adsorption.

The top half of Figure 6a–e shows the calculated bonding charge
density resulting from a single hydrogen atom chemisorbed at the “on-top”
position of the 1 × 1 CaB6 surface. The charge densities
in Figure 6a–e
show positive (red) and negative (blue) isosurfaces of the electron
density difference, ranging from the maximum deficit value of ±0.186
electrons Å–3, Figure 6a, down to a lower value of ±0.05 electrons
Å–3 given in Figure 6e. The obvious increase to the charge density
originates just above the terminal boron atom where the hydrogen has
become chemisorbed.

CaB6 1 × 1 slab. Images show isosurfaces taken at
(a) 0.186, (b) 0.150, (c) 0.100, (d) 0.050, and (e) 0.010 Å–3. Positive and negative deviations are shown as red
and blue surfaces, respectively. Bottom: charge density isosurfaces

densities of (f) 1.00, (g) 0.95, (h) 0.90, (i) 0.85, and (j) 0.80
Å–3.

Switching to the negative (blue) deviations,
density deficits in the form of rings begin to appear in Figure 6b around the terminal
boron atom (Bz,top). Successive reductions
in the density isosurfaces show the diffuse nature of this electron
localization on the clean surface lacking bound hydrogen, evidenced
by the negative charge density. The bottom portion of Figure 6 points to the origin of these
missing rings upon adsorption. Charge density plots for the relaxed
1 × 1 CaB6 surface are shown in Figure 6f–j for electron densities decreasing
from ρe = 1.00 Å–3 to ρe = 0.80 Å–3. In the absence of a suitable
hydrogen atom to interact with the affected surface atoms, considerable
structural and electronic rearrangement occurs to stabilize the electron-deficient
boron atoms. These atoms achieve this stabilization by contracting
inward and pulling significant density from the nearest three-center
two-electron bonds within the octahedra, though the overall charge
displacement can extend much further inward.

Table 2 shows the calculated distances
between hydrogen and the nearest boron atom for the “on-top”
position. Average distances between hydrogen and the nearest two and
three neighbors are also given for the “bridging” and
“face” positions. Calculated bond distances for the
“on-top” hydrogens qualitatively follow the trends shown
in Table 1, in which
a smaller and presumably stronger boron–hydrogen bond is accompanied
by an expansion of the surface octahedra toward the bulk value. Additionally,
for the multiatom bonding on the 1 × 1 slabs, the sigma-B–H
bond “on-top” is weakened by the presence of nearby
adsorbates, showing the influence of surface coverage.

3.3 Local Adsorption Energies
The calculated adsorption energies for each of the binding geometries
considered for 1 × 1 slabs are given in Table 3, where the adsorption energy is given by 4  where each of the calculations is performed in a supercell having
the same dimensions and described by the identical cutoffs and k-point grids. The strongest bond by far is found for LaB6 with hydrogen adsorbed “on-top”, having nearly
double the stabilization energy than all others. Reduced bond lengths
are found for the “on-top” position with “top/face”
geometries, described by the energy reduction upon multiatom adsorption.
It is also interesting to note that while the “bridging”
position by itself is unstable, having hydrogen adsorbed in the “on-top”
position actually makes this position favorable. This result supports
the conclusion that migrating hydrogen atoms on the surface follow
the facial and bridging pathways prior to recombination as these occurrences
are observed only after the hydrogen molecule dissociatively desorbs,
leaving one atom stuck to the top position. This atom effectively
pulls back the octahedral structure to a more bulk-like state or an
ideal 1 × 1 supercell. In this case, the region around the “bridging”
position becomes more significant in terms of electron density, favoring
potentially the adsorption of the second hydrogen atom in a slightly
higher electron region as some of the electron density of the boron
atom for the “on-top” position is no longer available.
For an ideal, unrelaxed, and symmetric 1 × 1 surface configuration,
the electron density around the boron atoms where the “on-top”
adsorption occurs is higher than around the “bridging”
region supporting the addition of the second hydrogen in 1 ×
1 supercells once the former has been occupied. Again, the difference
in electron density between “on-top” and “bridging”
is relatively small for the unrelaxed 1 × 1 configuration. Other
supercell configurations do not have the symmetric behavior of the
1 × 1 arrangement, suggesting that a different local distribution
of electron density due to geometrical positioning of the boron-terminated
atoms making the “on-top” to be generally favorable.

a Adsorption energies are given per hydrogen atom. Each geometry is
displayed in Figure 5.

Energetics for the larger 1 × 2, 1 × 4, and 2 ×
2 slabs are given in Table 4. Because of the large system sizes, only single-atom adsorption
is considered for these slabs. Adsorption in the top position is by
far more favorable for these larger slabs than the 1 × 1 surfaces.
This may be due to adsorbate–adsorbate interactions because
1 × 1 slabs did not consider coverage less than one monolayer.
However, the larger 1 × 4 slabs show decreasing energy, which
suggests that the adsorbate interactions are not long-ranged. In contrast
to the 1 × 1 slabs, the most stable adsorption is provided by
the CaB6 crystal with the 2 × 2 surface. The top positions
are again highly favored, and hydrogen atoms on the bridging sites
give rise to positive energies. Unfortunately, multiatom adsorption
is not calculated for these larger slabs, though the CPMD trajectories
suggest that this bridging site does in fact become accessible when
paired with a hydrogen localized on the top position.

3.4 Work Functions
The work
function of a material, defined as the minimum energy required to
remove an electron from the material at T = 0 K,39 can be determined from the difference of the
electrostatic potential energy in the vacuum, Evac, and the Fermi energy of the slab, EF, using 5  for a sufficiently large
slab, where “bulk”-like properties are prevalent. In
this work, planar averages are taken along the direction normal to
the surface to determine the vacuum potential and this is used along
with the Fermi energy of the slabs to calculate Φ. Work functions
are known to be heavily dependent upon the nature of the adsorbed
species, as these affect the electrostatic potential and therefore
the energy necessary for an electron to escape. In fact, the dipole
created by metal-terminated MB6 materials is one of the
main reasons LaB6 has such a low work function.40 Additionally, measurements of the work function
are proving to be a useful tool to investigate real-time adsorbate
surface coverage for some materials.41 The
work functions are calculated for each of the clean and adsorbate-covered
surfaces, and these are given in Table 5. Note that work functions for the 1 × 1 slabs
are calculated for boron-terminated surfaces and presented to identify
general trends. For more accurate calculations, a correction to eq 5 might be necessary because
of potential quantum effects in thin-film slabs,42 by decomposing the work function into separate bulk and
surface contributions. All of the surfaces have different electrostatic
conditions due the terminations not being the same, which explains
some of the variation observed in the calculations.

a Clean 1 × 1 slabs refer to completely boron-terminated
surfaces; cations are present on half of the surface sites for clean
1 × 2, 2 × 2, and 1 × 4 surfaces.

A general
trend observed is that stronger (more negative) adsorption energies
yield increased values of the work function for a particular surface.
This effect can be related to the stability induced by the adsorption
process. Atoms which become chemisorbed to the surface stabilize the
cleavage plane through a reduction in the total energy. However, these
electrons are effectively localized in space and have energies near
the Fermi level. Extracting these from the surface will then require
a substantial increase in energy as noted by the work function.

4 Concluding Remarks
Using a combination of self-consistent DFT calculations and CPMD
analysis, we have calculated the basic energetics and interacting
behavior of hydrogen with metal hexaboride surfaces. Energetics results
show that the local adsorption of a single hydrogen molecule per surface
unit cell (one ML) is possible and hydrogen atoms chemisorbed at the
dangling bond position are highly favorable. The additional electron
density reduces the stress caused during cleavage, producing surface
octahedra which have more regular shapes. Analysis of the CPMD simulations
also provides insights into the mechanisms accompanying hydrogen recombination
reactions on MB6 surfaces through dissociative adsorption
and the method of travel prior to recombination to be along the octahedral
face and bridging sites connecting separate unit cells on the surface.
