A new
class of fused quinazolines has been designed and synthesized
via copper-catalyzed Ullmann type C–N coupling followed by
intramolecular cross-dehydrogenative coupling reaction in moderate
to good yields. The synthesized compounds were tested for in vitro
antibacterial activity against three Gram negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Salmonella typhi) and two Gram
positive (Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria. Among all tested
compounds, 8ga, 8gc, and 8gd exhibited promising minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values
(4–8 μg/mL) for all bacterial strains tested as compared
to the positive control ciprofloxacin. The synthesized compounds were
also evaluated for their in vitro antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans and compounds 8ga, 8gc, and 8gd having potential antibacterial activity also showed pronounced antifungal
activity (MIC values 8–16 μg/mL) against both strains.
The bactericidal assay by propidium iodide and live–dead bacterial
cell screening using a mixture of acridine orange/ethidium bromide
(AO/Et·Br) showed considerable changes in the bacterial cell
membrane, which might be the cause or consequence of cell death. Moreover,
the hemolytic activity for most potent compounds (8ga, 8gc, and 8gd) showed their safety profile
toward human blood cells.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Bacterial
and fungal infections have become a global challenge
for human health because of the lack of sufficient and effective antimicrobial
drugs, especially in immune compromised patients. The increase in
prevalence and emergence of multidrug resistance among bacteria including
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has endangered the efficacy of antibiotics in the advent
of modern medicine.1 Antimicrobial resistant
bacteria result in increased mortality rate and increased healthcare
cost. According to a study by World Health Organization (WHO), microbial
infection can become one of the most serious causes for human death
in near future.2 Considering these facts,
there is an urgent need to develop new effective antibacterial agents
that circumvent the emergence of resistance and thus, there have been
tremendous efforts by researchers to find new antibiotics to combat
microbial resistance.3

Nitrogen-containing
heterocyclic compounds are the most abundant
and integral scaffolds because of their distinct biological and industrial
activities.4 In the past, a number of indole
and quinazoline-based compounds have been shown to be promising antimicrobial
agents (Figure 1).5 Hoemann et al. found that 2-(1H-indol-3-yl)quinolines (I) are effective against methicillin-resistant S. aureus with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)
values <1.0 μg/mL.6 Yu and group
synthesized a series of 2-(indole-3-yl)-thiochroman-4-ones (II) and found that these indole derivatives show good in vitro
antifungal activity with MIC in the range of 4–8 μg/mL.7 The bis(indole)alkaloid, topsentin (III) has received growing attention for their interesting antibacterial
properties.8 Kung et al. found that quinazoline-derived
compounds (IV) have exhibited good antibacterial activity
against Escherichia coli, S. aureus, and K. pneumonia with MIC values ranging from 0.2–12 μM.9 A few quinazoline-fused molecules such as indolo-, imidazo-,
and benzimidazo-quinazolines have also been found to exhibit potential
antifungal and antibacterial activities (Figure 1).10 For example,
indolo[1,2-c]quinazoline (V) has been
found to possess good antimicrobial activity with MIC values ranging
from 2.5–20 μg/mL.10a On the
basis of the high degree of bioactivity shown by molecules based on
indole, quinazoline, and imidazole moieties and also in continuation
of our ongoing research interest for the synthesis of novel-fused
heterocyclic molecules under mild reaction conditions,11 we became interested toward designing a novel
imidazo/benzimidazo[1,2-c]quinazoline structural
framework (8) that incorporates all these three moieties
into a single molecular framework and evaluate their potential additive
effects on the antimicrobial activities.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Chemistry
Initially, benzil and related
dicarbonyl compounds (1a–f), 2-bromoaryl aldehyde
(2), and ammonium acetate (3) were reacted
in the presence of l-proline/MeOH to provide a series of
2-(2-bromoaryl)-1H-imidazole (5a–f) via a multicomponent strategy.12 Similarly,
the reaction of 2-bromoaryl aldehyde (2) with 1,2-diaminobenzene
(4) in the presence of H2O2/CAN
gave 2-(2-bromophenyl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazole (5g) (Scheme 1).13

Scheme 1 Synthesis of 2-(2-Bromoaryl)-1H-imidazole and 2-(2-Bromophenyl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazole
The designed prototype that is fused imidazo/benzimidazo
quinazolines
(8) were synthesized by using our previous approach with
a slight modification in the reaction conditions.13 Interestingly, in the present approach, we have successfully
established copper-catalyzed cross-dehydrogenative coupling (CDC)
instead of a palladium-catalyzed CDC strategy reported earlier. Copper-catalyzed
Ullmann type C–N coupling between 2-(2-bromophenyl)-1H-imidazole/benzimidazole (5) with azoles (6) in the presence of CuI (20 mol %), K2CO3 in dimethylformamide (DMF) at 150 °C, followed by CDC
in the presence of Cu(OAc)2·H2O resulted
in the desired fused imidazo/benzimidazo quinazolines (8). As shown in Table 1, aryl substitution at C4 and C5- position on 2-(2-bromophenyl)-1H-imidazole was treated with different azoles such as 1,2,4-triazole,
imidazole and indoles to afford corresponding imidazo[1,2-c]quinazolines (8aa−ae)
in 40−65% yields. The 2-(2-bromophenyl)-1H-imidazole having different substituents such as -Me, -OMe and -F
at the p-position of aryl ring at C4 and C5- position
of imidazole smoothly reacted with imidazoles and pyrazole to give
respective imidazo[1,2-c]quinazolines (8bf−df) in 45−60% yields. Similarly, the
reaction of C4-arylated 2-(2-bromophenyl)-1H-imidazole
with imidazole and benzimidazole produced corresponding imidazo[1,2-c]quinazolines (8ef−eg)
in 62−70% yields. Furthemore, methyl substituted imidazole
at C4 and C5- position well tolerated under standard reaction conditions
and afforded the target product 8fb in 45% yield. Similarly,
2-(2-bromophenyl)benzimidazole (5g) also reacted with
different azoles (6) to afforded corresponding benzimidazo[1,2-c]quinazolines (8gf, 8ga, 8gh, 8gc, 8gi, and 8gd) in 35–70% yields. The molecular structure of the synthesized
imidazo/benzimidazo[1,2-c]quinazoline derivatives
(8) was confirmed by 1H and 13C
NMR and ESI-HRMS analysis.

2.2 Biology
2.2.1 Antimicrobial
Activity
Antibacterial
evaluation of imidazo/benzimidazo[1,2-c]quinazoline
derivatives (8) was carried out against a panel of three
Gram negative strains, viz., E. coli, Pseudomonas putida (P. putida), and Salmonella typhi (S. typhi) and two Gram positive
strains, viz., Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) and S. aureus using ciprofloxacin as a standard drug. Antifungal efficacy was
evaluated against pathogenic strains, viz., Candida
albicans (C. albicans) and Aspergillus niger (A. niger) using amphotericin B as a positive control.
The results of antimicrobial activity are presented in Table 2. Initially, to understand the
antibacterial effect of the synthesized compounds, zone of inhibition
(ZOI) was measured through the disc diffusion method. Presence of
these compounds in the culture medium increased the ZOI diameter by
1 to 7 mm. Compounds 8ga, 8gc, and 8gd, with an increase of 6–7 mm in the inhibition zone
diameter were found to be the most promising candidate for antibacterial
activity. Next, for quantitative measurement of the antibacterial
activity of 8aa–gd, MIC was evaluated. It was
found that the compounds (8aa–gd) effectively
inhibited the growth of pathogenic strains with MIC in the range of
4–64 μg/mL. Among all tested compounds, 8ga, 8gc, and 8gd were found to be most effective
compounds with MIC in the range of 4–8 μg/mL.

b No activity.

With respect to antifungal
activity, compounds 8bf, 8ef, 8gf, 8ga, 8gh, 8gc, 8gi, and 8gd exhibited
good to excellent activity against A. niger and C. albicans. Compounds 8bf, 8ef, and 8gh were found equally
potent (MIC in the range of 32 μg/mL) in comparison to the reference
drug amphotericin B, whereas compounds 8gf, 8ga, 8gc, 8gi, and 8gd even showed
better activity than the positive control with MIC in the range of
8–16 μg/mL.

It was observed that benzimidazole
derivatives substituted with
indoles (14gc–gd) and azoles [1,2,4-triazole (8ga), imidazole (8gf), and pyrazole (8gh)] exhibited better antibacterial activity in comparison to the imidazole
substrate containing similar motifs (8aa–fb).
More specifically, benzimidazole fused with indole-bearing electron-withdrawing
group (−Cl) exhibited comparatively better activity than the
electron neutral or electron-donating (−OMe) group. Similarly,
the benzimidazole substrate fused with indole and azoles (1,2,4-triazole,
imidazole, and pyrazole) exhibited better antifungal activity in comparison
to the imidazole substrate containing a similar scaffold.

2.2.2 Bactericidal Assay by Propidium Iodide
The propidium
iodide (PI) dye penetrates only the damaged or compromised
membrane and hence can be used to detect dead cells.14 The dye PI intercalates with double-stranded DNA, and subsequent
fluorescence detection allows assessment of the number of nonviable/dead
cells.15 The most potent compounds 8ga, 8gc, and 8gd were further tested
for their effect against the total cell population of P. putida using the PI dye. The microscopic images
of the bacterial culture treated with the compounds showed significant
cell death at 2× MIC, which is similar to the number of cells
for the positive control treated with the tert-butyl
hydroperoxide (TBHP) bacterial culture (Figure 2). The result revealed that the compounds 8ga, 8gc, and 8gd have potent bactericidal
activity.

Figure 2 Bactericidal assay against P. putida for compounds 8ga, 8gc, and 8gd.

2.2.3 Live–Dead
Bacteria Cell Screening
Acridine orange (AO) is a vital dye
and will stain both live and
dead cells, whereas ethidium bromide (Et·Br) will stain only
cells that have lost membrane integrity.16 The cell death assay caused by most efficient compounds 8ga, 8gc, and 8gd was evaluated by the AO/Et·Br
dual staining assay (Figure 3). In this assay, P. putida cells were stained with a mixture of AO and Et·Br. The dye
AO can enter inside living cells and binds with DNA of living cells
to emit green fluorescence, whereas Et·Br enters only through
the modified cell membrane of dead cells and emits red fluorescence.
The untreated bacterial cells displayed green fluorescence, whereas
the cells treated with compounds 8ga, 8gc, and 8gd exhibited red fluorescence along with minor
green fluorescence (Figure 3). This bacterial cell viability assay demonstrated that compounds 8ga, 8gc, and 8gd cause cell damage
by making loss of cell membrane integrity and thus illustrates the
bactericidal potential of these compounds.

cell screening by compounds 8ga, 8gc, and 8gd using AO/Et·Br dual
staining.

2.2.4 Evaluation
of Reactive Oxygen Species Production
A moderate reactive
oxygen species (ROS) generation plays a crucial
role in cell proliferation and differentiation, whereas the excess
production of ROS induces oxidative damage to cellular lipids, proteins,
and DNA in bacteria which leads to cell death. Therefore, the effect
of compounds 8ga, 8gc, and 8gd on cellular ROS level of P. putida bacterial cells was measured using the 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein
diacetate dye (DCFH-DA). A significant increase in the ROS level was
observed by the chemically synthesized compounds 8ga, 8gc, and 8gd against P. putida cells (Figure 4).
Compared to the untreated control cells, the compound-treated bacterial
cell showed enhanced generation of intracellular ROS. This intracellular-accumulated
ROS may also be responsible for bactericidal activity.

Figure 4 Evaluation of ROS production
against P. putida using the fluorescent
dye DCFH-DA as a probe.

2.2.5 Hemolytic Activity
To ascertain
the toxicity profile of synthesized compounds, hemolytic activity
was evaluated. The hemolytic activity can occur by several mechanisms,
from increased permeability of cell membranes to complete cell lysis.
The evaluation of hemolytic activity is to check the damage caused
by synthesized compounds to the membranes of RBCs (erythrocytes),
which leads to release of hemoglobin. It is an additional tool to
verify the importance of synthesized compounds against red blood cells
(RBCs) and may also give an idea to promote such compounds as a drug
level (Figure 5). The
toxicity profile of chemically synthesized compounds on human RBCs
was determined at a fixed concentration of 100 μM. The observed
results showed that most compounds caused 3–28% hemolysis.
Interestingly, the efficient antibacterial compounds 8ga, 8gc, and 8gd showed less than 10% hemolysis
at a high concentration of 100 μM, suggesting that these compounds
are negligibly toxic to human blood cells (Figure 5). The results of hemolytic activity further
support the significance of the present study.

Figure 5 Hemolytic activity on human RBCs using 8aa–8gd at 100 μM. Data were analyzed by mean
± SD (standard
deviation) of triplicate (n = 3) samples.

Figure 6 Hemolytic activity of compound 8ga on human
RBCs at
different concentrations 20–100 μM. Data were analyzed
by mean ± SD (standard deviation) of triplicate (n = 3) samples.

After the preliminary
hemolytic activity of tested compounds at
100 μM concentration, the concentration-dependent activity of
one of the most potent compounds 8ga was performed at
different concentrations (20–100 μM). It was found that
the hemolysis activity of 8ga increased with increasing
concentration and was less than 10% hemolysis for the concentration
range of 20–100 μM. The observed results of compound 8ga at different concentrations showed its negligible toxicity
to human blood cells (Figure 6).

2.2.6 Biofilm Inhibition
Bacterial biofilm
is an extracellular polymeric substance and composed of extracellular
polysaccharides and proteins, causing chronic infections in humans
via hospital and community environments. Biofilm formation provides
resistance to microbes against phagocytosis and other components of
the body’s defense system. Thus, compounds having antibiofilm
activity could prevent the contamination of biomedical implants. In
our study, we observed that most of the compounds showed antibiofilm
activity in the range of 20–70%, as compared to positive control
ciprofloxacin (Figure 7). The highest inhibitory activity was shown by compounds 8gc (70%), followed by 8ga (67%) and 8gd (63%)
(Figure 7). Compounds
can modulate the biofilm formation through the nonmicrobicidal or
biocidal mechanism. Moreover, these molecules weaken the biofilm either
by degradation of the extracellular matrix or targeting of extracellular
and intracellular signaling molecules.

Figure 7 Biofilm inhibition assay
against strain S. aureus by 8aa–8gd at 50 μg/mL. All experiments
were carried out in triplicates, and the values are indicated as mean
± SD.

The analysis of antibacterial
activity confirmed their efficacy
against tested bacteria because of damage on the bacterial membranes
and the effects of oxidative stress as evident by the live–dead
bacterial assay and ROS production, respectively. Generation of ROS
leads to a lethal effect on bacterial cells and can increase the bactericidal
process. The acute change in response to compound treatment may cause
the release and degradation of membrane proteins; this leads to the
loss of membrane integrity and bacterial cell morphology, formation
of fissures, and perforations in the cell membrane. The formation
of fissures and perforation leads to the leakage of cytoplasmic contents
from the cell; this increases the death consequences.

The overall
study concludes that benzimidazole derivatives bearing
the indole, 1,2,4-triazole, imidazole, and pyrazole group induced
greater oxidative stress and morphological changes like membrane damage.
Moreover, pathological outcomes such as DNA damage, alterations to
specific proteins, and enzymes responsible for different physiological
processes at the molecular level need further investigation.

3 Conclusions
A new series of imidazo/benzimidazo[1,2-c]quinazolines
has been synthesized via copper-catalyzed Ullmann type C–N
coupling followed by the intramolecular CDC reaction. All of the synthesized
compounds were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity. Among all,
compounds 8gf, 8ga, 8gc, and 8gd exhibited most promising antibacterial (MIC 4–8
μg/mL) and antifungal (MIC 4–16 μg/mL) activities.
The structure activity relationship of synthesized compounds revealed
that benzimidazo[1,2-c]quinazolines showed better
antimicrobial activity than imidazo[1,2-c]quinazoline
derivatives. Among benzimidazo[1,2-c]quinazolines,
1,2,4-triazole (8ga) and indole (8gc and 8gd)-fused benzimidazo[1,2-c]quinazolines
exhibited better antimicrobial activity as compared to other azoles.
The live–dead bacteria cell screening and increased ROS production
upon treatment with most active compounds 8ga, 8gc, and 8gd, illustrates their efficient membrane
penetration ability which might be the main cause of bacterial cell
death. Furthermore, synthesized compounds were also evaluated for
hemolytic activity which showed a negligible toxicity profile toward
human blood cells. The overall study concludes that compounds 8ga, 8gc, and 8gd may serve as potential
antimicrobial candidates for lead optimization.

4 Experimental
Section
All reagents and solvents were obtained from commercial
suppliers
and used without further purification unless otherwise mentioned.
Progress of the reactions was monitored by using thin layer chromatography
(TLC) on 0.2 mm silica gel F254 plates. The chemical structures
of the final products were determined by the NMR (1H and 13C) and HRMS analysis. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a 400 and 100 MHz spectrometer. Chemical
shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm) using tetramethylsilane
as an internal standard or the deuterated solvent peak (CDCl3 and DMSO-d6). HRMS data were recorded
on a mass spectrometer with an electrospray ionization and TOF mass
analyzer. Melting points were determined in open capillary tubes on
an automated melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. All tested
compounds were ≥95% pure by high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) with detection at 270 nm. Starting substrates 2-(2-bromophenyl)-4,5-diaryl-1H-imidazole and 2-(2-bromophenyl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazole were prepared by the following reported procedure.12,13

4.1 General Procedure for the Synthesis of Imidazo/Benzimidazo[1,2-c]quinazolines
A clean oven-dried 10 mL round-bottom
flask was charged with 5 (1.0 mmol), 6 (1.2
mmol), K2CO3 (2.0 mmol), CuI (0.20 mmol), and
DMF (2 mL). The resulting solution was stirred at 150 °C for
2 h. On completion of the first step monitored by TLC, Cu(OAc)2·H2O (0.5 mmol) was added in the same flask
without isolating the intermediate, and the reaction mass was further
stirred at 150 °C for 2–5 h. The reaction progress was
monitored by TLC. After completion, the reaction mass was allowed
to cool at ambient temperature, diluted with water (10 mL), and extracted
with EtOAc (2 × 10 mL). The combined organic layer was dried
over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated under
reduced pressure. The crude material was purified by column chromatography
on silica gel (100–200 mesh) using ethyl acetate/hexane (15%,
v/v) as an eluant.

4.2 Antimicrobial Activity
4.2.1 Antibacterial Activity
The compounds 8 were tested for antibacterial activity
against three Gram
negative bacteria including E. coli (MTCC 1652), P. putida (MTCC 102),
and S. typhi (98) and two Gram positive
bacteria including B. subtilis (MTCC
121) and S. aureus (MTCC 96) as per
the standard method.17 The tested strains
were collected from the Microbial Type Culture Collection and Gene
Bank (MTCC, India). The autoclaved Luria–Bertani agar medium
was poured into sterile glass Petri dishes (90 mm) under aseptic conditions.
After solidification of the medium, 100 μL culture of each pathogenic
culture (107 cfu/mL) was spread using a sterile glass spreader
and left for 15 min for complete adsorption. After adsorption, a well
size of 6 mm diameter was made by the sterile metallic borer, and
the solution of the working compound of different concentrations was
poured into the wells. After incubation at 37 °C for 24 h, the
diameter of ZOI was measured in comparison with standard antibiotic
“ciprofloxacin”. The solvent, DMSO was used as the negative
control, whereas antibiotic “ciprofloxacin” as the positive
control. For the MIC assay, test compounds were prepared in concentrations
of 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256 μg/mL in DMSO and serial
diluted test samples of each compound (200 μL) were added in
96-well microtrays. The test microorganism was added to microtrays
well to obtain a final volume of 400 μL and incubated at 37
°C for 24 h. The MIC value is defined as the lowest concentration
of the compound that inhibits the visible growth of bacteria (OD600 less than 0.06). Each assay was performed in duplicate
sets.

4.2.2 Antifungal Activity
The compounds 8 were tested for antifungal activity by the agar well diffusion
method against the fungal strains C. albicans (MTCC 3958) and A. niger (MTCC 9933).
For the experimental work, a loopful of each strain was grown in the
potato dextrose broth (PDB, HiMedia, India) medium at 28 °C for
4–5 days. Following optimal growth of each fungal strain, 100
μL of culture was uniformly spread on the potato dextrose agar
medium plate. Following adsorption, wells of 6 mm were prepared by
the sterile metallic borer and a solution of the working compound
of different concentrations was poured into the wells. Plates were
incubated at 28 °C for 4–5 days under dark conditions.
The mean diameter of the inhibition zone was measured to determine
antifungal activity. For the MIC assay, sterile test tubes containing
5 mL of sterilized Czapeks Dox broth medium was inoculated with 100
μL of freshly grown culture of each test strain and appropriate
amount of the compound was added to achieve the desired concentrations.
The tubes were incubated at 28 °C for five days under dark conditions
and carefully observed for the presence of turbidity. Amphotericin
B was used as the positive control. The experiment was performed in
duplicate sets.

4.3 Bactericidal Assay by PI
The single
colony of bacterium P. putida was inoculated
into the sterile nutrient broth medium and kept in an incubator shaker
(150 rpm) till the optical density (OD) of the culture reached up
to 0.8. The culture was treated with selected compounds at 2×
MIC for 4 h. After treatment, the culture was centrifuged at 5000g for 10 min, and the cell pellet was stained with 1.0 mg/mL
of PI (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). The stained colony was streaked on the
clean glass slide and covered with a glass slip. The population of
PI-positive bacterial cells was compared with untreated cells by epifluorescence
microscopy. During the experiment, the bacterial culture treated with
TBHP was taken as the positive control.

4.4 Live–Dead
Bacteria Screening through
Fluorescence Microscopy
To discriminate live and dead bacterial
cells, freshly grown culture of P. putida (107 cfu mL–1) was treated with compounds 8ga, 8gc, and 8gd for 4 h. Following
treatment, 5 μL each of AO (15 μg mL–1) and Et·Br (50 μg mL–1) was added in
a 500 μL of the P. putida culture.
The working solution of acridine orange and ethidium bromide were
prepared in the phosphate buffer saline (PBS) buffer. The suspension
was centrifuged at 5000g for 10 min, and the supernatant
was discarded. The cell pellet was washed with the 1× PBS buffer
(pH 7.2) three times to remove any traces of unbound dyes. The washed
cell pellet was streaked on the glass slide with a cover slip on top
of it and viewed under an epifluorescence microscope (Olympus-CKX41,
Olympus, Japan) at intensity between 450 and 490 nm using a 100×
objective lens and 10× eyepiece lens.

4.5 Evaluation
of ROS Production
To evaluate
the intracellular reactive oxygen species formation after compound
treatment, fluorescent dye DCFH-DA was used as probes. The DCFH is
a nonfluorescent dye, but is oxidized to the highly fluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein
(DCF) by intracellular H2O2 or nitric oxide.
At the mid log phase of bacterial growth, compounds were added to
the bacterial suspension (P. putida) for 2 h and then treated with 2 μM of DCFH-DA at 37 °C
for 30 min. The emitted fluorescence of DCF was measured at 530 nm
after excitation at 485 nm by fluorescence microscopy and qualitatively
screened for ROS production.

4.6 Hemolytic Activity
The compounds 8 were tested for hemolytic activity on
human RBCs following
the standard protocol with minor modifications.18 The healthy human blood samples of males between 25 and
28 age groups were collected from the hospital of BITS Pilani campus
following Institutional Ethics Committee guidelines and washed with
the sterile PBS solution at least three times. After washing, blood
was centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 6 min at room temperature and RBC
pellet was suspended in the PBS buffer. The RBC suspension of 0.1
mL was mixed with 0.5 mL buffer solution containing 100 μg/mL
of each compound in DMSO (1%, v/v) in the PBS buffer. DMSO (1%, v/v)
in the PBS buffer and Triton X-100 (1%) were used as negative and
positive controls, respectively. The samples were incubated at room
temperature for 3 h. Following incubation, samples were centrifuged
at 8000 rpm and absorbance of the supernatant was recorded at 540
nm. The percentage hemolysis was calculated by using the following
equation:

[% Hemolysis = (A540 test
sample – A540 negative control/A540 positive control – absorbance 540
negative control) × 100]. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate
sets.

4.7 Biofilm Inhibition Assay
The pathogenic
bacterial strain S. aureus was cultured
in the tryptic soy broth medium and OD of the bacterial suspension
was adjusted to 1 × 106 cfu mL–1. The synthesized compounds having concentrations of 50 μg/mL
were mixed to the grown bacterial culture and properly mixed. The
aliquots of 100 μL were distributed into the 96-well polystyrene
microtiter plates (Tarson, India) and kept under static conditions
at 37 °C for 24 h. The medium was discarded with micropipettes,
and the plate was washed with PBS buffer (1×, pH 7.2) to wash
away the nonadherent bacterial culture. The well of microtiter plates
were stained with 100 μL of 0.1% crystal violet solution for
30 min at room temperature. After incubation, the staining solution
was discarded, and wells were washed with autoclaved Milli-Q water
and kept for air drying at room temperature. The stained biofilm were
solubilized with 100 μL of 95% ethanol and absorbance was taken
at 540 nm. Blank wells were taken as the background control. All experiments
were carried out in triplicates, and the values are indicated as mean
± SD.
