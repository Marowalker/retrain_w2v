In the present study,
we have synthesized two novel corrosion inhibitors
BP-1 and BP-2 and evaluated their corrosion inhibition property on
mild steel (MS) in acid solution through weight loss and electrochemical
corrosion techniques. The corrosion test results reveal that both
compounds inhibit corrosion by an adsorption mechanism and display
inhibition efficiency more than 95% at a low concentration of 1.72
× 10–4 M. From the surface analysis of the
protective film on MS, it was corroborated that adsorption of inhibitor
molecules occurred on the MS surface through chemisorption, which
further suppresses the corrosion rate. Density functional theory simulated
data helps correlate the experimental trend with the theoretical study.

1 Introduction
Pyranopyrazoles have been
considered as a significant category
of heterocyclic compounds due to their widespread applications in
pharmaceuticals and biodegradable agrochemicals.1 Pyranopyrazole compounds exhibited numerous biological
activities like anticancer, antibacterial, antiherpetic, and molluscicidal
activities.2 These observations have prompted
us to evaluate corrosion inhibition characteristics of bispyranopyrazoles
(BPs). BPs have been selected in the present investigation as corrosion
inhibitors because they are highly functionalized heterocyclic compounds
with NH2 and CN as functional groups and possess four N
and two O atoms in the ring, besides π electrons, through which
they can readily attach on the surface of mild steel (MS) and bring
down the corrosion rate.3 Another interesting
feature is that they can be synthesized very easily by multicomponent
one-pot reactions with good yields using green chemistry principles.2

In the present investigation, we have used
a theoretical method,
density functional theory (DFT), to perceive the corrosion inhibition
efficiency (IE) of the studied compounds. These techniques are inexpensive
and time-saving, provide detailed information about the mechanism
of corrosion inhibition in comparison with traditional methods, and
help simulate the obtained experimental results with estimated molecular
properties (high occupied molecular orbital energy) (EHOMO), low unoccupied molecular energy (ELUMO), energy gap (ΔE), global
softness (GS, σ), global hardness (GH, η), electronegativity
(χ), and fraction of electrons transferred (ΔN) from BPs to MS.4−6

Our research group has reported earlier four
pyranopyrazoles that
showed corrosion inhibition efficiency (88–98%) at 200 mg/L.7 In the present effort, we have synthesized two
new corrosion inhibitors BP-1 and BP-2, which are likely to give enhanced
inhibition efficiency compared to that of earlier reported pyranopyrazoles
at lower concentrations because these molecules are more functionalized
than previously reported pyrazoles. We have compared the inhibition
performance of BPs with some previously reported inhibitors and found
their better corrosion inhibition performance. Gupta et al. have reported
α-aminophosphonates as corrosion inhibitors for mild steel.
These inhibitors gave 58–96% IE at (141–564) ×
10–6 M. Wang et al. reported S-benzyl-O,O′-bis(2-naphthyl)dithiophosphates
as corrosion inhibitors, which showed IE of 70–95% at 40–100
mg/L.8,9 To the best of our knowledge, there is no
previous investigation on the use of bispyranopyrazoles for the corrosion
inhibition of metallic substrates in an acidic environment.

Herein, we investigate the application of two interface inhibitors
BP-1 and BP-2 for the corrosion inhibition of MS samples in an acidic
environment through gravimetric and electrochemical measurements.
Surface characterizations of MS samples without and with BPs were
performed to analyze the protective inhibitor film. Quantum chemical
theoretical studies were also performed to investigate the correlations
between experimental observations and the quantum chemically calculated
values (Table 1).

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Gravimetric
Measurements
The gravimetric
measurement results for MS samples in test acidic solution in the
presence and absence of BPs are summarized in Table 2. It is a reliable approach to optimize the
influence of concentrations of the corrosion inhibitor on inhibition
effectiveness (Figure 1).10 The obtained
results indicated that addition of BP-1 and BP-2 prevents the MS against
corrosion and also the corrosion inhibition efficiency increases with
the increase in concentration of BPs, presented in Figure 2. Of the two inhibitors, BP-2
shows higher inhibition efficiency, and the order of inhibition is
BP-2 (98.01%) > BP-1 (96.02%) at 1.72 × 10–4 M. Furthermore, the good inhibition performance is ascribed to the
attachment of BP molecules on the MS surface, which is supported due
to the existence of numerous heteroatoms (N, O) in BPs with large
molecular structure of BPs. Furthermore, the variance in the corrosion
inhibition efficiency between BP-1 and BP-2 is ascribed to the nature
of the substituent group attached to the pyrazole ring. In the BP-2
molecule, the presence of phenyl group increases the electron density
at the active centers, which facilitates more interaction of this
inhibitor with the MS steel surface as compared to that of BP-1, which
is devoid of substituents.11

2.1.1 Adsorption Isotherms
The obtained
values of surface coverage (θ) by gravimetric measurements for
BP-1 and BP-2 were used to find the best-fitted adsorption isotherms.
The adsorption isotherms help understand the interaction between the
inhibitor molecules and the metal surface. The inhibitor molecules
adsorb on the metal surface either physically or chemically. To understand
the adsorption phenomenon, different adsorption isotherms (Temkin,
Freundlich, and Langmuir isotherms) were applied to the experimental
results. It was observed that the Langmuir adsorption isotherms fitted
very well, with the regression coefficient (R2) value for BP-1 and BP-2 of 1, suggesting good fitting. The
obtained slope and intercept values for the Langmuir isotherm are
0.99646, 7.77607 × 10–6 for BP-1 and 0.98767,
5.62968 × 10–6 for BP-2. For Freundlich R2, the slope and intercept for BP-1 are 0.95898,
0.08934, and 0.32206 and for BP-2, 0.9537, 0.06734, and 0.24743; for
Temkin R2, the slope and intercept for
BP-1 are 0.95665, 0.1858, and 1.6662 and for BP-2, 0.9590, 0.1451,
and 1.5318, respectively. The Langmuir adsorption isotherm plot between C/θ and Ci shown in Figure 3, and the equation
is represented below 1  where C represents
the concentration
of the inhibitor, θ is the surface area, and Kads is the adsorption equilibrium constant. The Kads values were obtained by a linear straight
fitted plot between C/θ and C to obtain free energy of adsorption ΔGads. Kads is related to ΔGads by the following equation 2  where R is the gas constant
and T is the absolute temperature. The value 55.5
is the concentration of water in solution in mol/L. By putting Kads in the above equation, the ΔGads values were obtained.

Figure 3 Langmuir adsorption isotherms
for MS in the presence of bispyrano[2,3-c]pyrazoles.

It is reported that the values
of ΔGads varying between −40
kJ/mol and more negative values
suggest that the adsorption is chemisorption, whereas the value of
ΔGads around −20 kJ/mol or
less negative implies that the adsorption is due to electrostatic
interaction, i.e., physisorption.12,13 The ΔGads values for BP-1 and BP-2, i.e., 40.42 and
41.24 kJ/mol, suggest chemisorption type of adsorption.

2.2 Electrochemical Corrosion Studies
The variation obtained
in open circuit potential (OCP) for MS corresponding
to the reference electrode in the absence and presence of BP-1 and
BP-2 is graphically represented in Figure 4. It is apparent from the OCP vs time plot
that the presence of BPs shifts the steady state potential toward
more negative values without changing common features. This shift
in the steady state potential toward a nobler direction is attributed
to dissolution of the surface oxide layer and formation of a protective
film of the inhibitor on the MS surface.14

Figure 4 OCP
vs time plots for MS in 1 M HCl without and with bispyrano[2,3-c]pyrazoles.

The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results
were analyzed
with the proposed equivalent circuit diagram for MS immersed in the
test solution in the presence and absence of BPs are displayed in Figures 5–7. The parameters obtained by fitted
Nyquist arcs are summarized in Table 3. The equivalent circuit diagram consists of Rs (electrolytic resistance), polarization resistance
(Rp), that is analogous to the constant
phase element (CPE). From the Nyquist plots, it is clearly observed
that both BPs exhibit one capacitive arc/loop for MS and that the
diameter of the capacitive arc with addition of BPs is higher as compared
to that in 1 M HCl without BPs. In general, the diameter of the Nyquist
arcs is associated with the polarization resistance (Rp).15−17 The Rp for BPs increases
with an increase in concentration, and the highest Rp values for BP-2 and BP-1 are 481.9 and 210.0 Ω
cm2 at 1.72 × 10–4 M, respectively.

The inhibition efficiency (η%) was estimated
as 3  where Rp(i) and Rp represent the polarization resistance in the
presence and absence of BP-1 and BP-2. The observations from Table 3 reveal that addition
of different concentrations of BPs causes an increase in the inhibition
efficiency and that for BPs the inhibition order is BP-2 (97.80%)
> BP-1 (94.96%) at 1.72 × 10–4 M. Moreover, Cdl values decrease with increasing BP concentrations.
This decreasing Cdl points toward/suggests
more adsorption of BP molecules on the metal surface, which provide
better surface coverage, thereby decreasing the exposed area.18

The double layer capacitance (Cdl)
can be calculated by including CPE parameter values like Y° and n by the equation 4  where Y° indicates the
CPE constant and n and ω represent the CPE
exponent and angular frequency, respectively.

Figure 7 displays
the EIS results in Bode resistance and phase angle formats. In general,
the ideal capacitive behavior can be recognized when a slope value
reaches −1 with phase angle −90°. The deviation
of the phase angle along with slope values with BP molecules ranged
from 0.71–0.83 to 62–71° compared with the blank
slope i.e., −0.54 and phase angle −39°. The movement
away/deviation of Bode resistance and phase angle parameter from perfect
values confirms the capacitive behavior of MS on addition of BPs.19

Polarization plots for MS samples in 1
M HCl without and with different
concentrations of BPs are presented in Figure 8. Generally, a potentiodynamic polarization
study provides valuable evidence regarding the kinetics involved in
the reactions occurring at the anodic and cathodic areas and also
what type of inhibition action is taken by corrosion inhibitors on
the basis of corrosion potential. It is reported in many research
articles that the presence of corrosion inhibitors suppresses the
electrochemical reactions (anodic and cathodic) occurring on the metal
surface, which results in lowering of the corrosion current icorr. The decrease in icorr suggested the corrosion inhibition phenomenon.20,21

Figure 8 Polarization
curves for MS in 1 M HCl without and with bispyrano[2,3-c]pyrazoles.

Table 4 presents
the values extracted from Tafel fit analysis such as corrosion current
density (icorr), corrosion potential (Ecorr), and cathodic (βc) and
anodic (βa) Tafel constants. From the obtained results, it is clearly visible that the
addition of BPs transfers the corrosion potential toward the more
negative direction, which is less than 85 mV compared to that without
the inhibitor, signifying a mixed type of inhibitor.22−24 The βc and βa values concurrently
changed in a similar pattern on increasing BP concentrations, supporting
the mixed action of inhibition.12 However,
for the potential higher than −340 mV/SCE, the presence of
BP-2 and BP-2 does not change the current-vs-potential characteristic
in the anodic region (Figure 8). This potential can be defined as a desorption potential.
Similar results have been reported by some other authors.25−27 On continuous discussion of results, it is also seen that the
addition of BP-1 and BP-2 into 1 M HCl causes a decrease of icorr values (74.0 and 31.6 μA/cm2 at 1.72 × 10–4 M). The reduction of icorr in the presence of BPs in comparison to
that without the inhibitor, i.e., in 1 M HCl (1800 μA/cm2) for MS, clearly indicated retardation in the electrochemical
reaction, resulting in corrosion prevention.

2.3 Surface
Characterization after Immersion
The surface morphological
observation for the steel samples in
the test acid solution without and with 1.72 × 10–4 M BP additives, after an exposure period of 6 h at 308 K was carried
out by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The polished MS surface
is shown in Figure 9a. The MS samples exposed to 1 M HCl solution are subjected to severe
corrosion shown in Figure 9b. On the other hand, a smooth surface with less damages was
observed in the case of the MS surface with the addition of BP-1 and
BP-2 (Figure 9c,d),
which suggests that the MS surface was adequately protected from corrosion
by the addition of BPs.28,29

Figure 10a–c
displays the surface topographic images of the MS surface immersed
without and with BP-1 and BP-2 in acid solution. The MS samples immersed
in 1 M HCl showed a very rough surface with 188 nm surface roughness,
whereas a reduction in surface roughness (48, 24 nm) is obtained in
the presence of BP-1 and BP-2, suggesting corrosion inhibition.30,31

Figure 10 Atomic force microscopy (AFM) micrographs of MS surface in (a)
1 M HCl and in the presence of (b) BP-1 and (c) BP-2, at 1.72 ×
10–4 M.

The IR spectra of pure BP-1 and attenuated total reflection
(ATR)-IR
study of adsorbed BP-1 on the MS surface are displayed in Figure 11. The observed
peaks at 3230, 3104, and 2187 cm–1 represent N–H
and C≡N stretching peaks for BP-1. From the inspection of ATR-IR
spectra (Figure 10) of the inhibited MS, it could be evidently indicated that the observed
C≡N and N–H stretching peaks shifted toward lower frequency.
This lower frequency shift is attributed to the interaction of BP-1
with MS. In addition with that the mentioned peaks shifted
in adsorbed inhibitor spectra of MS surface compared to pure BP-1
suggested the adsorption of inhibitor molecules on steel surface and
shift towards lower frequency is attributed owing to the exchange
of electrons between metal d orbitals and inhibitor molecules.32,33

inhibited MS.

Figure 12 shows
the contact angle images of the MS sample surface in the test acid
solution and the inhibited surface by the adsorption of BP-2. The
contact angles obtained in the case of MS immersed in blank and inhibited
solutions are found to be 74 and 123°, respectively. The lower
value of contact angle, 74°, in corroded MS due to direct contact
with acid (Figure 12a) shows the hydrophilic nature of corrosion products, which allows
water droplets to spread on the MS surface. However, opposite to that,
the inhibited MS surface shows a 123° contact angle with the
MS surface, representing development of hydrophobic nature after adsorption
of inhibitor and supporting corrosion34 inhibition in the presence of BP-2 (Figure 12b).

Figure 12 Contact angle measurement pictures for
MS exposed to (a) 1 M HCl
and (b) 1 M HCl + BP-2.

The interaction between the BP molecules and MS surface was
further
examined with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. Figure 13a displays the
low-resolution survey XPS spectra of the blank and inhibited MS surface,
and the elements including Fe, C, N, and O were noticed in the case
of inhibited MS surface. Figure 13b–e presents the high-resolution deconvoluted
profiles for C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, and Fe 2p for the MS surface with the
BP-2 inhibitor film. The deconvoluted C 1s spectrum (Figure 13b) for inhibited steel exhibits
three key peaks, which indicated the three different chemical states
of carbon on the MS surface. The largest peak appearing at 284.65
eV could be ascribed to the C–C, C=C, and C–H
aromatic bonds, and the next peak is ascribed to the C–N and
C=N bonds in the pyrazole ring with distinctive binding energy
(BE) of 283.53 eV. Furthermore, the third peak around 282.62 eV is
probably ascribed to the carbon atom of C=N+ in
the pyrazole due to the protonation of the =N– structure
in the pyrazole ring and/or the coordination of nitrogen in the pyrazole
ring with the MS surface. The XPS spectrum of N 1s (Figure 13c) is decomposed to three
components. The first component appearing at 398.52 eV is attributed
to the N atom of C–N bonds and the unprotonated N atoms (=N−)
in the pyrazole ring. The next component takes the highest influence
and might be attributed to coordinate N atoms of pyrazole rings with
the MS surface (N–Fe), which shifts toward
higher BE. Furthermore, the final component appearing at 400.83 eV
may be associated with protonated nitrogen atoms in pyrazole rings.
Hence, the appearance of the N 1s peak at 399.96 eV (Figure 13a) specifies the existence
of thin layer of BP molecules over the MS surface, and further deconvolution
of N 1s signals corroborates the interaction of N atom with the iron
surface (N–Fe).35 Furthermore, the
O 1s spectrum at 530.40 eV (Figure 13d) might be ascribed to the production of oxide (Fe2O3) on the MS surface.36−38 The Fe 2p spectrum
of MS surface in the presence of BP-2 is displayed in Figure 13e. The Fe 2p spectrum of the
MS surface with BP-2 illustrates the double peak profile positioned
at around 711.43 eV (Fe 2p1/2) and 725.32 eV (Fe 2p3/2), displaying a certain degree of oxidation of the steel
surface. From the obtained XPS results, it was supported that chemisorption
of BP-2 molecules on the MS surface takes place via sharing of electrons among nitrogen
atoms and/or the π electrons and vacant d-orbitals of Fe.

2.4 Quantum Chemical Studies
The quantum
chemical calculations are very helpful in attaining more information
on the phenomenon of inhibition. The corrosion inhibition performance
of an inhibitor is associated with the calculated quantum chemical
factors such as EHOMO, ELUMO, ΔE, η, σ, χ,
and ΔN and Mulliken charges on the atoms. These
parameters can be observed by the optimization of the studied inhibitor
molecules.39,40 These parameters help predict
metal–inhibitor interactions. In the present study, all of
the quantum parameters were calculated for both neutral and protonated
BP molecules in gas phase. The results obtained are summarized in Table 5.

ΔN	1.52	1.54	–0.638	–0.626	
The optimized geometries of neutral and protonated
BP-1 and BP-2
are shown in Figures 14 and 15. The inhibitor reactivity can be realized
by their frontier molecular orbital energies, EHOMO and ELUMO. The distributions
of the frontier molecule orbital density for BPs are presented in Figures 14 and 15. In general, the EHOMO energy value demonstrates the electron donating capacity of the
inhibitor. The high value of EHOMO infers
that the inhibitor has a high affinity to offer electrons to suitable
acceptor molecules, whereas the ELUMO values
indicate the electron accepting capacity from metal to inhibitor.
Generally, the lower value of ELUMO reveals
that the inhibitor can certainly accept electrons from the metal by
back-donation. The lower value of ΔE (ΔE = ELUMO – EHOMO) represents good inhibition performance of the molecule.41,42 The global hardness (GH) and global softness (GS) are other important
factors that give information about molecular stability and their
reactivity.43 The energy gap for a hard
molecule is large, whereas for a soft molecule, it is low. Hence,
the high value of GS and low value of GH suggest a higher corrosion
inhibition efficiency.44,45

In neutral inhibitor
molecules (Figure 14), Table 5 shows that
the ΔE value for
BP-1 (1.675 eV) is greater than that for BP-2 (1.583 eV), which are
very well correlated with the experimental results. The values of
global softness (σ) and fraction of electrons transferred (ΔN) for BP-2 > BP-1 and global hardness (η) for
BP-2
< BP-1 are also in support of experimental results. The EHOMO value of BP-2 (−3.162 eV) is lower
than the EHOMO value of BP-1 (−3.108
eV), which is slightly inconsistent with the experimental results.

The Mulliken charge analysis is useful to estimate the adsorption
centers of inhibitors. The more negatively charged the heteroatom,
the more the ability to be adsorbed on the metal surface.22 For BPs, the higher negative charges are found
around the nitrogen, oxygen, and some carbon atoms, which indicates
that these are the coordinating sites of the inhibitors, but the nitrogen
attached as −NH2 with the ring shows that higher
negative Mulliken charges have been selected for the protonation sites.
The Mulliken charges are given in Table 6.

ΔE value for BP-2 (2.140 eV) is lesser than
that of BP-1
(2.333 eV), which supports the experimental observations. The discussed
parameters like σ, ΔN, and η for
neutral molecules show the same supporting experimental trend in the
case of protonated molecules, i.e., BP-2 > BP-1 for σ and
ΔN and BP-2 < BP-1 for η. The EHOMO value of BP-2 (−7.233 eV) is higher
than EHOMO of BP-1 (−7.480 eV),
supported very
well the experimental results. These findings clearly suggest that
BP-2 forms strong bonds with the Fe metal as it shows better inhibition
efficiency (98.01%) than that of BP-1 (96.02%).

In the case
of protonated inhibitor molecules (Figure 15), the values of EHOMO for BP-1 and BP-2 are lower, −7.480 and −7.233
eV, as compared to those for the neutral molecules (−3.108
and −3.162 eV) due to protonation. It means that the electron
donating ability of EHOMO decreases. Therefore,
the formation of bond between the inhibitor and the metal occurs by
sharing of electrons from the metal to the inhibitor (back-donation).
The values of ΔE, ΔN, η, and σ support that BP-2 is a better inhibitor than
BP-1. The quantum chemical parameters (ΔE,
η, σ, and ΔN) showed good agreement
with the obtained experimental results, suggesting higher corrosion
inhibition efficiency of BP-2 than that of BP-1.

3 Conclusions
Both the synthesized bispyranopyrazoles BP-1
and BP-2 showed excellent
inhibition efficiency of 96.02 and 98.01% at 1.72 × 10–4 M, respectively. BP-2 having a phenyl substituent showed a higher
inhibition efficiency than BP-1. EIS analysis showed that an increase
in the concentration of inhibitors increases Rp on the metal surface and decreases Cdl. Potentiodynamic polarization suggests that the investigated
BP-1 and BP-2 acted as mixed-type inhibitors. SEM, AFM, FTIR-ATR,
and contact angle studies corroborated the formed inhibitor film on
the MS surface. Specifically, XPS studies confirmed the presence of
a thin film of inhibitor on the MS surface, which is formed by BP-2
inhibitor molecules via mutual sharing of electrons. The quantum chemical
values and experimental results were observed to be in very good agreement.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Methods
The steel samples
(25 mm × 20 mm × 0.6 mm and 80 mm × 10 mm × 0.6
mm) were utilized as base substrates for the gravimetric and electrochemical
corrosion tests and have following elemental configuration: Mn-0.596%,
Si-0.066%, C-0.066%, P-0.028%, S-0.010%, and remaining iron (wt %).
Before each experiment, the MS samples were ground using SiC sheets
ranging from 600 to 1200 grade, cleaned with water followed by acetone,
and dried. The diluted test solution (1 M HCl) with double-distilled
water was prepared using analytical-grade 37% HCl.

4.2 Inhibitors
The two bispyranopyrazoles,
4,4′-(1,4-phenylene)bis(6-amino-3-methyl-2,4-dihydropyrano[2,3-c]pyrazole-5-carbonitrile) (BP-1) and 4,4′-(1,4-phenylene)bis(6-amino-3-methyl-1-phenyl-1,4-dihydropyrano[2,3-c]pyrazole-5-carbonitrile) (BP-2), were prepared on the
basis of the previous report.2Figure 1 shows the schematic
route for the synthesis. At the completion of the synthesis, the obtained
compound was sieved and rinsed appropriately using EtOH for the desired
product. The molecular structures of BP-1 and BP-2 are shown in Table 1. The 1H NMR spectra was recorded using a Bruker instrument at 500 MHz and
IR spectra with an FTIR (02) (Perkin Elmer, Bruker) spectrophotometer.
The spectral data for BP-1: 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ: d = 1.74 (s, 6H,
2CH3), 4.53 (s, 2H, 2CH), 6.79 (s, 4H, 2NH2),
7.11 (s, 4H, C6H4), 12.07 (s, 2H, 2NH) ppm,
IR (KBr) cm–1: 3230, 3104, 2187, 1640, 1585, 1487.

4.3 Gravimetric Measurements
The gravimetric
measurements were performed using MS samples in 1 M HCl without and
with BP-1 and BP-2. The MS samples were first ground, washed, dried,
and weighted. These specimens were immersed in a 100 mL conical flask
for 6 h at 308 K with and without BPs. After the designated exposure
period, the MS samples were removed, cleaned with distilled water
and subsequently with ethanol, and allowed to dry. The loss in weight
was estimated by the difference in weight of MS samples before and
after the exposure. The other parameters like corrosion rate (CR), corrosion inhibition efficiency (η%),
and MS surface coverage (θ) were calculated by the following
equations 6   7   8  where W represents the loss
in weight of the specimen (mg), A is the coupon area
(cm2), t is the exposure time (h), and CR and CR(i) represent
the corrosion rates without and with BPs.

4.4 Electrochemical
Measurements
Electrochemical
corrosion analysis was done by a Gamry G300-45050 potentiostat/galvanostat
through a typical three-electrode cell assembly having MS samples
(exposure zone of 10 mm2) acting as working, saturated
calomel electrode (SCE) and Pt (platinum) sheet become reference and auxiliary electrode respectively.
All of the electrochemical corrosion tests were carried out after
a 30 min immersion period for MS to achieve steady open circuit potential
(OCP). The EIS test was accomplished with an alternating current amplitude
of 10 mV using a frequency region of 105–10–2 Hz. Furthermore, the potentiodynamic polarization
test was performed by adjusting the potential of ±250 mV vs OCP
with the scanning speed of 1.0 mV s–1. For data
analyses, fitting, and simulations, Gamry Echem Analyst 5.50 software
was used.

4.5 Surface Characterization
To investigate
the morphological changes on the MS surface before and after the addition
of BPs, scanning electron microscopic (SEM) examination was done by
the Ziess Evo 50 XVP instrument model at 1.00k× magnifications.
The MS samples were initially immersed without and with 1.72 ×
10–4 M BP-1 and BP-2 for 6 h at 308 K. After the
exposure period, the MS samples were taken out, rinsed with water
followed by ethanol, and allowed to dry to analyze surface microstructure.
To investigate the surface topography, AFM was performed by an NT-MDT
multimode AFM on the MS sample surface after the exposure period.
The attenuated total reflectance study was performed using Bruker-Alpha
FTIR spectroscopy with model Eco-ATR. For data analysis, we have used
OPUS spectroscopy software. The contact angle study of the MS surface
exposed to 1 M HCl without and with BP-2 was executed by Ramé-Hart
Goniometer model 250. MS substrates were immersed in 1 M HCl containing
2.0 mM inhibitors for 24 h. After removal from the solutions, the
MS samples were washed with ethanol and allowed to dry at room temperature.
The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) analysis was done by the
Al Kα radiation as a source, and the take-off angle θ
was attuned to 45° based on the standard surface.

4.6 Quantum Chemical Studies
Quantum
chemical estimations for BP molecules were done in gas phase with
both neutral and protonated modes via the DFT approach with the Becke
three-parameter hybrid functional along with the Lee–Yang–Paar
correlation functional (B3LYP).46−48 All estimations were done by
Gaussian 03 software with the 6-31G(d,p) basis set.49 The estimated parameters were extracted depending upon
the electronic values of the most stable conformers of the investigated
inhibitors. The obtained frontier molecular orbital energies such EHOMO and ELUMO help
calculate further important factors including ΔE, η, σ, χ, and ΔN using
the following equations50,51 9   10   11   12   13  where χFe and ηinh represent the
electronegativity and hardness of Fe, respectively.
For χFe, a reported magnitude of 7 eV/mol was utilized,
whereas for ηFe, 0 eV/mol was used for Fe.52 Recent literature reveals that the theoretically
chosen value of χFe = 7 eV is not acceptable because
in this case only free electron gas Fermi energy of iron is taken
into consideration and electron–electron interaction is neglected.
Therefore, to avoid this anomaly, the work function (ϕ) of the
metal surface is used in place of χFe and the equation
is rewritten as 14  For an iron surface having a higher stabilization
energy and packed surface, i.e., Fe(110) is used, and its DFT-derived
ϕ value is 4.82.53
