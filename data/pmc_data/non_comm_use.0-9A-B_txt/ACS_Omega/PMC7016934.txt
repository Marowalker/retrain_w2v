Fuel cell technology is the supreme alternate option
for the replacement
of fossil fuel in the current era. Pt alloys can perform well as fuel
cell electrodes for being used as catalytic materials to perform the
very notorious oxygen reduction reaction. In this regard, first, a
layered metal–organic framework with empirical formula [C8H10CdO7]n·4H2O is synthesized and characterized using various
experimental and theoretical techniques. Then, a nanostructured porous
carbon material with a sheet morphology (PC900) having a high BET
surface area of 877 m2 g–1 is fabricated
by an inert-atmosphere thermal treatment of the framework upon heating
up to 900 °C. Pt and Ni nanoparticles are embedded into PC900
to prepare a homogenized hybrid functional material, i.e., Pt-Ni@PC900.
The Pt-Ni@PC900 hybrid is proved to be an excellent ORR catalyst in
terms of half-wave potential and limiting current density with 7%
Pt loading compared with the commercially available 20% Pt/C catalyst.
Pt-Ni@PC900 also shows stability of current up to 12 h with only a
very small variation in current. This work highlights the importance
of Pt alloys in future large-scale commercial applications of fuel
cells.

==== Body
1 Introduction
A fuel cell is one of
the renewable energy devices, and for its
commercialization the main hurdle is the development of an economic,
efficient, and durable catalyst that can perform the most vital oxygen
reduction reaction (ORR).1−6 Various Pt-based hybrid compounds have been utilized to perform
the ORR, but still there are durability, efficiency, and economic
problems.7 The main challenge is to reduce
the Pt content in the catalyst by coupling Pt with other cheap metals,
such as Ni and Cu, along with a porous carbon material as a support.8−11 Therefore, the role of a support in a catalyst to enhance its activity,
stability, and durability is very vital.12,13 Carbon-based fuel cell catalysts, whether they are used with carbon
as a support or alone as catalysts, have shown impressive results.14−17

Metal–organic frameworks are very promising materials
for
important applications, such as in luminescence, optical sensors,
and NLO materials.18−21 Owing to the versatility, including porosity, surface area, electrochemical
stability, and good electrical conductivity, of metal–organic
framework-derived nanostructured carbon, it is reported as a good
functional support for precious metal nanoparticles and alloys of
nanoparticles to provide excellent electrocatalytic activity during
electrochemical catalysis reactions.22−27 These carbon-supported electrocatalysts have performed well in many
electrocatalytic applications, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction,
direct-methanol fuel cells, alkaline and acidic fuel cells, dehydrogenation
processes for hydrazine, and oxidation of formic acid.23−26,28

Here, we have synthesized
Cd-MOF crystals and characterized through
single-crystal X-ray analysis. The computational study of the cadmium
MOF is performed using the B3LYP/LANL2DZ level of theory in vacuum.
Geometric parameters, and IR and UV–vis spectra are calculated
and examined in detail. Also, its NLO properties are investigated
at the same level of theory, and it is found that the NLO properties
of the cadmium complex are better than those of urea. The framework
was then sacrificed to obtain a nanostructured porous carbon material,
which was utilized as a support to prepare a Pt-Ni@PC900 composite
with 7% Pt loading. The synthesized composite was tested as an ORR
catalyst for alkaline fuel cells. The results in terms of the onset
potential, half-wave potential, limiting current density, and accelerating
durability test were compared with those of the 20% Pt/C catalyst.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structural Details
Yang et al. proposed
the theoretical quantum mechanical properties of Cd-MOF-5 by considering
its similarity with Zn-MOF-5 due to the same linker molecule,29 while the reported Cd-MOF30,31 with a H2BDC linker was different from the proposed structure
of Cd-MOF-5. An effort was made to achieve the desired structure,
as claimed. Different synthetic protocols were adopted to find the
structure, as claimed, i.e., Cd-MOF-5. But our experimental finding
was also the same as that reported but with a small variation in the
synthesis scheme. One advantage was that in previous schemes DMF was
used,32,33 whereas in our synthetic route, it was completely
hydrothermal; hence, toxic DMF was avoided, and the yield was also
improved through temperature, time, sonication, and heating rate control.
The compound, (C8H10CdO7)n·4H2O, crystallized in an orthorhombic
system with the Pcca space group. Each Cd atom is
coordinated to three water molecules and two carboxylate oxygen in
a chelating manner, generating a 2D coordination chain, as shown in Figure 1a. The crystal refinement
details are given in Table S1. The extended
two-dimensional structure of the compound is presented in Figure 1b.

of the crystal structure of Cd-MOF along the b-axis
(blue spheres show the Cd metal). (b) Extended two-dimensional
framework structure of Cd-MOF (blue spheres show the Cd metal). (c)
Optimized structure of the cadmium MOF at the B3LYP/LANL2DZ level
in the gas phase (the atom name with number is given on the spheres;
red color for oxygen, yellow color for carbon, blue color for hydrogen,
and light blue color for Cd metal).

The Cd compound was optimized at the B3LYP/LANL2DZ
level in the
gas phase, and the optimized structures are displayed in Figure 1c with atomic labeling.
The Cd metal atom is surrounded by seven coordinate covalent bonds
formed by the oxygen atoms labeled O1, O2, O7, O8, O9, and O10, related
to two BDC–2 ligands and three water molecules.
Four oxygen atoms (O1, O2, O7, and O8) of the two BDC–2 linkers and one oxygen atom O11 of a water molecule are present
in the equatorial positions, while the remaining two oxygen atoms
(O9 and O10) belonging to the remaining two water molecules are in
the axial positions. The selected theoretical and experimental structural
parameters of the studied Cd-MOF are given in Table S2. The theoretical bond lengths for Cd-O1 and Cd-O2
related to one BDC–2 linker are 2.057 and 2.061
Å, while the corresponding experimental bond lengths are 2.500
and 2.357 Å, respectively. The calculated bond lengths of the
second BDC–2 ligand for Cd-O7 and Cd-O8 are 2.046
and 2.049 Å, while the corresponding experimental bond distances
are the same as for Cd-O1 and Cd-O2. The experimental and theoretical
measurements for the Cd-O bond related to both BDC–2 ligands connected to one Cd metal in the framework showed agreement
with a small variation. The Cd-O bond lengths for the three coordinated
water molecules were found to be in the ranges 2.041–2.050
and 2.236–2.250 Å theoretically and experimentally, respectively.
The reported experimental and theoretical Cd-O bond length for a seven-coordinated
Cd complex system lie in the range 2.332–2.648 Å, which
match well with those for the Cd coordination polymer in this study.34−36 The bond angles calculated through DFT calculations for O1-Cd1-O2,
O7-Cd1-O8, O1-Cd1-O9, and O7-Cd1-O11 are 63.6, 63.9, 92.4, and 74.7°
that show variations with the corresponding experimental values of
53.79, 53.79, 88.37, and 82.66°, respectively. According to Table S2, bond lengths between the metal and
donor atoms are close to 2 Å. The bond angle among O9, Cd1, and
O10 is equal to 168.3°, justifying the axial positions. Additionally,
the sum of angles in the equatorial position (O1-Cd1-O2, O2-Cd1-O11,
O1-Cd1-O8, O7-Cd1-O8, and O7-Cd1-O11) is equal to 363.7°. The
geometric structure of a related compound is a distorted pentagonal
bipyramid. As for the dihedral angles, these angles imply that there
is generally a planarity in the molecule. The Cd metal–organic
framework is layered, and each layer is connected with the other one
through hydrogen bonds.31

2.2 FTIR and Theoretical IR Spectroscopy of Cd-MOF
FTIR and theoretical IR spectra of Cd-MOF are presented in Figure 2a. The detailed peak
positions with suitable assignment of bonds derived from spectral
results are given in Table S3. The medium
broad absorption bands in the experimental spectrum of Cd-MOF at 3556,
3474, and 3414 cm–1 are related to the existence
of coordinated water molecules.37,38 Similar bands for O–H
asymmetric and symmetric stretches in the calculated spectrum are
located at 3750 and 3600 cm–1, respectively. The
stretching vibrations for C=C appear at 1616 cm–1 in the experimental spectrum, while the theoretical assignment for
the said vibrations is at 1598 cm–1. The asymmetric
and symmetric stretching bands for COO–1 are present
at 1498 and 1267 cm–1 in the experimental spectrum,
respectively. These vibrations in the calculated spectrum are found
at 1424 and 1186 cm–1, respectively. The frequency
gap between these two stretches provides information about the coordination
modes of the ligand with metal.39−41 The coordination mode for one
BDC–2 is tetradentate. The C–O stretching
vibrations lie at 1410 and 1430 cm–1 in experimental
and theoretical infrared spectra, respectively. The Cd–O bond
vibrations are present at 643 and 487 cm–1 in theoretical
calculations, while in experimental findings the Cd–O bond
vibrations are exhibited at 621 and 481 cm–1.

2.3 Electronic Transitions and Surface Properties
of Cd-MOF
The calculated electronic absorption spectra of
Cd-MOF at the TD-B3LYP/LANL2DZ and TD-B3LYP/LANL2DZ-CPCM levels along
with the experimental spectra are shown in Figure 2b. The theoretical results for the gas phase,
water, ethanol, and DMSO are 248 nm (ε = 1), 250 nm (ε
= 78.3553), 251 nm (ε = 24.852), and 251 nm (ε = 46.826),
respectively. The experimental maximum wavelengths for water, ethanol,
and DMSO are at 240 nm (ε = 450), 261 nm (ε = 347), and
272 nm (ε = 321), respectively. The maximum wavelength associated
with all solvents corresponds to π–π* transitions.42 The theoretical results show that energy differences
between frontier molecular orbitals are similar to each other in each
area. Therefore, freedom of electron movement is similar to each other
in each area.

By utilizing theoretical calculations, active
sites of the Cd organic framework are analyzed here to elucidate the
mechanistic path for the reaction of the title MOF. The mentioned
active sites can be proposed via molecular electrostatic potential
(MEP) surfaces, MEP contours, frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) and
energy diagrams. In this study, the energy diagrams of molecular orbitals
are examined, and contour diagrams of frontier molecular orbitals,
which are HOMO and LUMO, are calculated and presented in Figure S1. The energy of LUMO is 7.224 ×
10–2 eV, while HOMO has an energy of 7.847 ×
10–2 eV. The energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO
is 0.623 eV. The low energy gap between the LUMO and HOMO provides
information about the reactivity of the complex molecule. The contour
diagram for the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the
lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is calculated by considering
the fact that there are no co-energetic orbitals around the HOMO and
LUMO. It can be concluded that the electrons of the HOMO are mainly
localized on the outermost oxygen atoms, while for the LUMO, if the
studied framework accepts electrons, the electrons are mainly delocalized
on the structure. Additionally, MEP maps and contour diagrams for
molecular orbitals for Cd-MOF are calculated and presented in Figure S2. According to the MEP map shown in Figure S2, the most active region or site is
the environment around the outermost oxygen atoms. The active region
is indicated by the red and yellow colors in the MEP map. The negative
charge is concentrated around the oxygen atom.

2.4 THz Spectroscopy Measurements
The
terahertz time-domain (THz-TD) spectroscopy is very useful to study
low-frequency vibrations, which are very important for determining
the lattice dynamics that will decide the breathing phenomenon of
metal–organic frameworks for absorption and release of radiation,
and it also provides information about the stability of the frameworks.43,44 Terahertz (1012 hertz = 1 THz) light, which is the intermediate
region between microwaves and infrared waves, has been used for the
investigation of water hydration dynamics with the MOF-5 material.45 This powerful technique is useful to find the
refractive index that lies in the range of 10 GHz to a few THz,46 and it is also used to determine the dielectric
properties of coordination polymer materials.47 The absorption coefficients of the H2BDC ligand and Cd-MOF
in the frequency range of 0.1–2.78 THz are presented in Figure 2c. Spectra of both
samples show peaks at 1.41 THz (46.88 cm–1). The
peak at 2.07 THz (69.35 cm–1) in H2BDC
is slightly shifted to a lower frequency of 2.05 THz (68.37 cm–1) in Cd-MOF. H2BDC shows a peak at 2.49
THz (83.02 cm–1), while in Cd-MOF, a shoulder is
observed at this position. Cd-MOF shows absorption at 2.25 THz (75.21
cm–1), which is not present in H2BDC.
The presence of these absorption bands is in accordance with the calculated
spectra of Zn-MOF-5.48,49 The presence of absorptions at
1.41, 2.07, and 2.49 THz in both Cd-MOF and the H2BDC linker
suggests that these absorptions are associated with the collective
motions of the linker molecules. This fact is also supported by Schrock
et al.48 The absorption peak at 2.25 THz
in Cd-MOF may be due to Cd clusters, as was also suggested by Nina
et al50 for Zn-MOF-5. Figure 2d shows the real and imaginary
parts of the dielectric constant of Cd-MOF and H2BDC in
the frequency range of 0.1–2.78 THz. The real and imaginary
dielectric constants of Cd-MOF are higher than those of H2BDC for all frequencies, except at higher frequencies for which the
imaginary dielectric constant is lower for Cd-MOF. The peaks and humps
in the dielectric constant at different frequencies are associated
with the vibrational motions, as described above. The higher real
dielectric constant of Cd-MOF may be due to its increased crystallinity
than that of H2BDC. Further, heavier atoms (i.e., Cd) have
higher electronic polarizability, which supports the higher dielectric
constant of Cd-MOF. Similar behavior of the real dielectric constant
is also observed for crystalline and amorphous aluminum oxide.51

2.5 NLO Properties
Nonlinear optical
properties are important for optical devices and the telecommunication
industry. Nonlinear optical properties can be affected by molecular
planarity, π-electron delocalization, and substituent change
associated with the molecule and solvent. The hyperpolarizability
value is generally related to the nonlinear optical properties (NLO)
for a single molecule or the repeating unit of a coordination polymer.
The reported hyperpolarizabilities for second harmonic generation
of different cadmium metal–organic frameworks are 0.6 ×
urea,52 0.7 × urea,53 1.5 × KDP,54 2.3 ×
KDP,54 2 × KDP,55 and 3 × KDP55 (KDP, potassium
dihydrogen phosphate). Although experimental NLO calculations for
any material are very important, but being an option, the NLO potential
of the material can be analyzed using theoretical chemistry without
applying experimental techniques.56 Cd-MOF
is investigated at the B3LYP/LANL2DZ level in the gas phase. The static
dipole moment (μ), average linear polarizability (α),
anisotropic polarizability (Δα), the first hyperpolarizability
(β), and optical softness (σO) of the cadmium
compound and urea were calculated and compared, as given in Table 1. The static dipole
moment, average linear polarizability, anisotropic polarizability,
the first hyperpolarizability, and optical softness are calculated
to be 1.916 D, 2.197 Å3, 9.659 Å3,
4.232 × 10–28 cm5 esu–1, and 0.120 eV–1, respectively, for urea, and 3.143
D, 108.353 Å3, 272.224 Å3, 1.614 ×
10–26 cm5 esu–1, and
4.407 eV–1 for the cadmium MOF, respectively. According
to these results, the NLO properties of Cd-MOF are better than those
of urea.

2.6 Powder XRD of (C8H10CdO7)n·4H2O, PC900, and Pt-Ni@PC900
The phase purity of the (C8H10CdO7)n·4H2O crystals was confirmed by the mutual resemblance
between the single-crystal data obtained from the simulation and the
experimental powder XRD patterns presented in Figure 3a. The powder XRD patterns of PC900 and Pt-Ni@PC900
are presented in Figure 3b. The absence of any peak for CdO in PC900 confirms the elimination
and evaporation of the Cd metal with reference to the PDF card number
65-2908.57 The framework first decomposed
into a CdO composite; then, under argon supply, CdO was reduced to
the Cd metal, which evaporated upon heating up to 900 °C, as
the boiling point of Cd is 767 °C, leaving behind the porous
carbon material. The broad peaks present in the PXRD of PC900 at 2θ
values near about 22.5 and 43.6° are the characteristic peaks
related to the 002 and 100 planes of the carbon material. The PXRD
of the Pt-Ni@PC900 composite exhibited peaks at 2θ values of
39.9° (111), 46.4° (200), 67.7° (220), and 81.6°
(311) related to Pt. The 2θ peak positions for pure Pt are 39.4,
45.96, 67.36, and 81.01°, which are at lower 2θ values
than those reported here for the Pt-Ni@PC900 composite and may be
related to the modification in the lattice constants of Pt and Ni
metals.58−60 The information collected from the high-intensity
peak at a 2θ value of 39.8° (111) are the interplanar spacing
(d111, 0.226 nm), lattice parameter (α, 0.392
nm), full-width at half-maximum (FWHM, 0.0180 radian), and crystallite
size (Dcryst, 8.19 nm).

and Pt-Ni@PC900. (c) C
1s core-level XPS spectra of PC900 and Pt-Ni@PC900. (d) Pt 4f core-level
XPS spectra of Pt-Ni@PC900.

2.7 XPS Analysis of PC900 and Pt-Ni@PC900
The curve-fit spectra of C 1s related to PC900 were deconvoluted
into four peaks, C=O (285.96 eV), C–C (285.1 eV), C–O
(284.6 eV), and C=C (284.1 eV), as shown in Figure 3c.61,62 The C 1s spectra related to Pt-Ni@PC900 were resolved into four
peaks resulting at C=O (285.7 eV), C–C (285 eV), C–O
(284.7), and C=C (284.2), as shown in Figure 3c. The platinum metal doublets related to
Pt-Ni@PC900 appear at two different positions of binding energies,
as shown in Figure 3d; the doublet peak with a higher binding energy is related to Pt
4f5/2, and the other band at a lower binding energy is
related to Pt 4f7/2. The deconvolution of the doublet resulted
in five peaks. The high-intensity bands present at binding energies
of 71.2 and 74.6 eV are related to metallic Pt. The small-intensity
peaks at 72.0, 73.2 and 76.3 eV are due to the oxides of Pt. The negative
shift of 0.4 eV in comparison with the standard binding of Pt (71.8
eV)63 provides information that the Pt
metal is involved in the electron donation and acceptance process
with the second metal, which is Ni, an indication of the existence
of a core–shell structure.64 The
Ni 2p XPS spectrum of Pt-Ni@PC900 contains core peaks related to Ni
2p3/2 and 2p1/2, which is further resolved into
four peaks shown in Figure S3a. The metallic
Ni peaks are at 854.8 and 873.6 eV, while the nickel oxide peaks are
at 861.8 and 879.7 eV.65 The Ni peak of
Pt-Ni@PC900 shows a positive deviation with reference to the standard
nickel metal peak at 852.6 eV. The O 1s core line of Pt-Ni@PC900 (Figure S3b) is a convolution of two broad peaks
at 531.9 eV for (M-O) and 533.3 eV for (C-O).66 The elemental analysis by XPS, CHNS/O, and metal composition confirmed
by ICP is presented in Table S4. The percentage
atomic composition of Pt-Ni@PC900 found from XPS is Pt 4f (5.8%),
Ni 2p (2.92%), C 1s (80.94%), and O 1s (10.34%). The ICP results show
Pt to be 6.03% and Ni to be 3.73% for Pt-Ni@PC900. The percentage
of elements from ICP is slightly higher than that found from XPS.
The CHNS/O results correlate with theoretical calculations and also
show better agreement with XPS results.

2.8 Raman Spectroscopy of PC900 and Pt-Ni@PC900
The chemistry of PC900 and Pt-Ni@PC900 can be further understood
through Raman spectroscopy. The Raman spectra of PC900 and Pt-Ni@PC900
are shown in Figure S4. The PC900 spectrum
shows two peaks, one at ∼1584 cm–1 with an
intensity of 21.2 called the G-band is the characteristic identity
of the graphitic layer that appears due to E2g phonon of
the sp2 carbon atoms. The other peak located at ∼1339
cm–1 with an intensity of 22.3 corresponds to the
D-band, which can be assigned to the A1g mode breathing
vibrations of the aromatic rings that are bound to sp3-C
at the edges and defect sites. The ratio of the intensities of the
D- and G-bands (R = ID/IG) informs about the range of structurally
ordered graphite sites present in the porous carbon material. The
intensity of the D-band is higher in PC900 and the Pt-Ni@PC900 composite
than that of the G-band owing to the presence of disordered and defects
sites in all compounds. The positions of the D- and G-bands along
with their intensities and intensity ratio for all compounds are given
in Table S5.

2.9 Nitrogen Adsorption Analysis
The
specific surface area, pore volume, and pore-size distribution were
obtained for [C8H10CdO7]n·4H2O, porous carbon (PC900) and
Pt-Ni@PC900 through N2 adsorption–desorption measurements.
The details of all aforementioned parameters are given in Table S6. The isotherms and pore volume distribution
curves for PC900 and Pt-Ni@PC900 are presented in Figure 4a,b. All isotherms showed type
IV characteristics with an H3 hysteresis loop.67 The BET surface area of PC900 obtained by heating
Cd-MOF in an inert atmosphere was calculated to be 877 m2 g–1. It is a well-known fact that for an electrochemical
reduction process a carbon substrate with a high surface area is very
much important to prepare composites for electrocatalytic activity
due to the fact that there is an increase in the diffusion rate and
mass transfer of the electrolyte. The total pore volume of pores with
less than 73.03 nm width for PC900 at P/Po = 0.97 was found to be 1.128934 cm3 g–1. The BET adsorption average pore width was 5.1 nm
for PC900. The large surface area of PC900 was the main reason for
selecting this material as a substrate to synthesize bimetallic hybrids.
A prominent decrease in BET surface area and total pore volume was
observed for the prepared bimetallic composites. The BET surface area
and total pore volume of Pt-Ni@PC900 were calculated to be 359.49
m2 g–1 and 0.43 cm3 g–1, respectively. The isotherm of Pt-Ni@PC900 was similar
to that of its carbon substrate PC900. The decrease in the surface
area and pore volume was related to the loading of metal nanoparticles,
especially for the microporous region.68 The intense peak found at 3.8 nm for PC900 near the microporous
region showed the formation of the mesoporous carbon material by the
evaporation of Cd. The intensity of the peak situated at 3.8 nm for
Pt-Ni@PC900 was decreased. The reduction in the intensity was related
to the fact that not all but most of the pores were filled with metal
particles.

plot of PC900 and Pt-Ni@PC900. TEM images of (c) PC900 and (d) Pt-Ni@PC900.

2.10 Surface Morphology
SEM images related
to Cd-MOF, PC900, and Pt-Ni@PC900 are presented in Figure S5a–c, respectively. In the pristine framework,
(C8H10CdO7)n·4H2O, there are sheets with average dimensions of
370 × 162 μm, as shown in Figure S5a. These sheets were cracked upon heating up to 900 °C due to
elimination of the cadmium metal, being volatile at 767 °C in
an argon atmosphere. The cracked broken sheets with average dimensions
150 × 99 μm related to the PC900 carbon material can be
seen in Figure S5b. The sheets with average
dimensions 33 × 54 μm related to the catalytic material,
Pt-Ni@PC900, are presented in Figure S5c. The surface of Pt-Ni@PC900 appears to be smooth in some areas of
the sheet due to the filling of cracks with metal particles, while
there are still some cracks that might support the catalytic process.

TEM images for PC900 and Pt-Ni@PC900 are shown in Figure 4c,d, respectively. Nanostructured
PC900 with a spherical morphology has an average particle size of
∼23 nm. The dense spots with an average particle size of ∼3.9
nm for Pt-Ni@PC900 indicate the presence of metal nanoparticles supported
on the carbon material.

2.11 Oxygen Reduction Reaction
The oxygen
reduction reaction was carried out by utilizing a rotating ring disk
electrode (RRDE) at 1600 rpm with a scan rate of 5 mV s–1 in 0.1 M KOH solution as the electrolyte with oxygen saturation.
ORR polarization curves of Pt-Ni@PC900 and 20% Pt/C are presented
in Figure 5a. The onset
potential (potential at 1% of the total limiting current density)
for Pt-Ni@PC900 and 20% Pt/C are 1.067 and 1.079 V, respectively.
The onset potential related to Pt-Ni@PC900 is 25 mV more negative
than that of 20% Pt/C. The half-wave potentials of Pt-Ni@PC900 and
20% Pt/C are 0.909 and 0.90 V vs RHE. The half-wave potential of Pt-Ni@PC900
is relatively more positive than that of 20% Pt/C. The half-wave potential
and limiting current density of Pt-Ni@PC900 are comparatively better
than those of the commercial 20% Pt/C catalyst. Therefore, it can
be easily concluded that Pt-Ni@PC900 is the best ORR catalyst. The
ORR activity is also verified by the Tafel slope; the smaller slope
is related to better ORR activity. The Tafel slope (Figure 5b) found for Pt-Ni@PC900 is
56 mV decade–1, which is less than 64 mV decade–1 (20% Pt/C). CV of Pt-Ni@PC900 and 20% Pt/C was performed
in 0.1 M KOH solution using a ring disk electrode under saturated
N2 and O2 at a scan rate of 50 mV s–1 (Figure 5c). CV curves
under O2 presented a prominent ORR peak (solid line), while
the corresponding peak was absent in the CV curve under N2 (dashed line).

Figure 5 (a) ORR results for Pt-Ni@PC900 and 20% Pt/C at a rotation
rate
of 1600 rpm in the basic electrolyte of 0.1 M KOH with oxygen saturation
at 5 mV s–1 through a constant potential of 1.5
volt vs RHE applied on the Pt-ring; the disk current is located at
the lower side, while the ring current, called the positive current,
is present on the upper side (dotted curves). (b) Tafel plots from
ORR LSV results (at 1600 rpm) for Pt-Ni@PC900 and 20% Pt/C. (c) CV
curves of Pt-Ni@PC900 and 20% Pt/C on the RDE with 50 mV/s scan rate
under saturated nitrogen (dotted lines) and O2 (solid lines)
in 0.1 M KOH. Pt-Ni@PC900 shows much more positive ORR onset potential
and higher cathodic current than 20% Pt/C. (d) Electron number and
H2O2 yield results gathered from RRDE data displayed
at different potentials vs RHE. (e) K-L plots for Pt-Ni@PC900 and
20% Pt/C at 0.7 V vs RHE. (f) LSV results for Pt-Ni@PC900 and 20%
Pt/C before and after ADTs.

The number of electrons transferred (n) for one
O2 molecule and HO2–1 yield (which is the reaction intermediate)
decide whether the ORR process is by two electrons or four electrons.
Both (n) and HO2–1 yield are shown in Figure 5d. The HO2–1 yield is found to be
less than 8% for Pt-Ni@PC900, which is comparable to that of 20% Pt/C,
for which the HO2–1 yield is less than 7%. This is an indication of the best ORR performance
of Pt-Ni@PC900 with 7% Pt. The n values lie between
3.84 and 3.91, suggesting that the ORR catalyzed by all catalysts
proceeds mainly via a four-electron process (O2 + 2H2O + 4e–1 → 4OH–1). The two-electron process (O2 + H2O + 2e–1 → OH–1 + HO2–1) is less
feasible compared to the four-electron process for all electrocatalysts.

Koutecky–Levich plots (J–1 vs ω–1/2) obtained from LSV curves at different
rotation speeds and 0.7 V vs RHE for Pt-Ni@PC900 and 20% Pt/C are
presented in Figure 5e. The graph shows good linear fitting for the first-order kinetics,
and the calculated number of electrons supports the four-electron
process for all catalysts in this study. The kinetic current density
calculated at 0.7 V vs RHE for Pt-Ni@PC900 and 20% Pt/C is 58 and
29 mA cm–2, respectively.

LSV on an RDE with
different rotation speeds from 400 to 2025 rpm
was done to correlate the ORR process with the RRDE analysis by fixing
similar electrochemical parameters to those used during ORR measurements
with the RRDE. LSV results at different rotation speeds for Pt-Ni@PC900
and 20% Pt/C are shown in Figure S6a,b, respectively. The limiting current density increases with the increase
of rotation speed.

Accelerating durability tests (ADTs) were
performed for our synthesized
catalysts and commercial 20% Pt/C to check their practical usability
in fuel cells. The ADTs for all catalysts in this study were carried
out in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte for 1000 cycles
at a scan rate of 50 mV s–1 using an RDE at 25 °C.
The O2 flow remained continuous throughout 1000 cycles.
After the completion of 1000 cycles, CV and LSV were performed. It
was found through CV that the loss of electrochemical active surface
area for Pt-Ni@PC900 and 20% Pt/C was 18 and 35%, respectively, as
shown in Figure S7. LSV curves taken at
1600 rpm after 1000 CV cycles are presented in Figure 5f. LSV results after ADT showed that the
difference in both the onset and half-wave potentials for Pt-Ni@PC900
is 19 mV after 1000 CV cycles, whereas 20% Pt/C shows a difference
of 17 mV for the onset and 30 mV for the half-wave potential. The
stability and durability of our synthesized catalysts are enhanced.
These curves are coherent with the CV findings for all catalysts.
The results of ADTs (Table 2) clearly demonstrate that the synthesized catalyst, Pt-Ni@PC900,
shows excellent stability and durability compared with the commercially
available 20% Pt/C catalyst. The working electrode stability test
for Pt-Ni@PC900 was run in 1 M KOH alkaline solution, as shown in Figure S8. The hybrid retained a constant current
density (67 mA cm–2) under a constant potential of 0.5 V for 12 h, which is good sign
of durability and stability.

3 Conclusions
Cd-MOF with empirical formula
[C8H10CdO7]n·4H2O was synthesized,
characterized, and theoretically verified by various analytical techniques.
The framework was also analyzed by THz-TD spectroscopy to calculate
collective vibrations of the coordination polymer at low frequencies
that was helpful to characterize the polymer relative to the linker.
THz-TD spectroscopy showed a higher value of the real dielectric constant
for Cd-MOF as compared to H2BDC, which was due to the increased
electronic polarizability by the incorporation of the heavier Cd metal
atom and also owing to the increased crystallinity compared to H2BDC. Nonlinear optical analysis through DFT showed that the
first static hyperpolarizability of Cd-MOF was 38 times higher than
that of NLO-active urea. Nanostructured carbon with a high surface
area obtained through carbonization of Cd-MOF was used as a support
for the preparation of Pt-Ni@PC900. ORR measurements performed using
Pt-Ni@PC900 with 7% Pt as the working electrode material showed excellent
performance in terms of efficiency and durability over the commercially
available 20% Pt/C catalyst.

4 Experimental Section
The computational
method, characterization techniques, and ORR
measurement details are described in the Supporting Information.

4.1 Synthesis of [C8H10CdO7]n·4H2O
A mixture of 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (150 mg, 0.9 mmol) and
cadmium acetate dehydrate (240.65 mg, 0.9 mmol) along with potassium
hydroxide (101 mg, 1.8 mmol) in 40 mL of deionized water was sonicated
for 2 h in a 100 mL Teflon vial. The homogeneous mixture was then
sealed in a 100 mL steel autoclave. The autoclave was heated up to
160 °C for 72 h and then cooled at a rate of 5 °C/min. Good-quality
colorless needlelike crystals were obtained with a yield of 74%.

4.2 Carbonization of [C8H10CdO7]n·4H2O
Cd-MOF was sacrificed through heat treatment by placing
2 g of it in a tube furnace coupled with argon gas supply. The temperature
of the furnace was raised up to 900 °C in three steps, i.e.,
the temperature was kept constant for 1 h at 400 °C, then for
1 h at 600 °C, and in the end for 4 h at 900 °C. The obtained
black color crystalline material was cooled, dried, and named PC900.

4.3 Synthesis of Pt-Ni@PC900
The Pt-Ni@PC900
composite was prepared according to the polyol reduction method; 120
mg of PC900 was dispersed in ethylene glycol solvent through a sonication
process for 1 h. The homogenized dispersed suspension was then heated
up to 100 °C, and the temperature of the mixture was kept constant,
i.e., at 100 °C, during dropwise slow addition of two separate
salt solutions, i.e., 10 mL of an aqueous solution of Ni(CH3COOH)2·4H2O and 10 mL of an aqueous solution
of H2PtCl6·6H2O. The suspension
was then refluxed for 5 h, which resulted in the formation of a composite
with a Pt:Ni weight ratio of 7:5. The synthesis of [C8H10CdO7]n·4H2O and Pt-Ni@PC900 is presented in Scheme 1.
