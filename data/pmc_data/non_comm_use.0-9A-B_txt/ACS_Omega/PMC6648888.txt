Nitrite and ammonia
often coexist in waters. Thus, it is very significant
to develop a photocatalytic process for the simultaneous removal of
nitrite and ammonia. Herein, zinc ferrite/activated carbon (ZnFe2O4/AC) was synthesized and characterized by X-ray
diffraction spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Raman
spectroscopy, and ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy.
The valence band level of ZnFe2O4 was measured
by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy–valence band spectroscopy,
and first-principles calculation was performed to confirm the band
structure of ZnFe2O4. The as-synthesized ZnFe2O4/AC species functioned as a photocatalyst to
simultaneously remove nitrite and ammonia under anaerobic conditions
upon UV–visible light irradiation at the first stage. The results
indicated that an average removal ratio of 92.7% with ±0.2% error
for nitrite degradation for three runs was achieved in 50.0 mg/L nitrite
+ 100.0 mg/L ammonia solution with pH 9.5 under anaerobic conditions
for 3 h at this stage; simultaneously, the removal ratio of 64.0%
with ±0.2% error for ammonia was also achieved. At the second
stage, oxygen gas was bubbled in the reactor to photocatalytically
eliminate residual ammonia under aerobic conditions upon continuous
irradiation. The results demonstrated that the removal ratios for
nitrite, ammonia, and total nitrogen reached to 92.0, 90.0, and 90.2%
at 12th hour, respectively, and the product released during photocatalysis
is N2 gas, detected by gas chromatography, fulfilling the
simultaneous removal of nitrite and ammonia. The reaction mechanism
was exploited.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Nitrite
(NO2–) is very toxic to human
health. It can combine with hemoglobin to form methemoglobin in the
body, decreasing the ability of red blood cells to carry oxygen. Moreover,
it can be converted into carcinogenic nitrosamine, which causes hypertension,
leukemia, brain tumor, stomach, and bowel cancers.1,2 Ammonia
(NH3 or NH4+) can be easily transferred
to NO2– in natural waters because of
nitrifying bacteria, resulting in the coexistence of NO2– and NH3 in natural waters. Owing to
their hazardous nature, the World Health Organization recommends the
limit concentration of 3.0 mg/L for nitrite and 1.5 mg/L for ammonia
in drinking water to protect humans from health risks.3 Therefore, the simultaneous removal of NO2– and NH3 is very significant to human health.

The conventional biological removal of nitrogen can be achieved
by nitrification and denitrification processes. The nitrification
process is the oxidation of NH3 or NH4+ to nitrate (NO3–) through the pathway
of NH4+/NH3 → NO2– → NO3– in
the presence of aerobic bacteria. Nitrite could be the ultimate product
formed during the nitrification process when the dissolved oxygen
is inadequate, for example, at the deep bottom of waters. Subsequently,
anaerobic bacteria start the denitrification process, which reduce
NO3– or NO2– to nitrogen molecules by the pathway of NO3– → NO2– → NO →
N2O → N2 under anaerobic conditions.4 Both nitrification and denitrification pathways
are complicated and time-consuming, in which a carbon source is needed
and temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen are controlled painstakingly
and accurately to maintain the activity of bacteria and removal efficiency
of total nitrogen.5,6 Therefore, the development of
a simple, economical, time-saving, and easy-going process for the
complete removal of nitrogen is very desired.7,8

In theory, photocatalysis can realize both oxidization and reduction
processes in viewpoint of electrochemistry if the electrode potential
is appropriate. The photogenerated electrons on the conduction band
of a semiconductor material could reduce a substrate molecule if the
conduction band level (Ec) is more negative
than the standard electrode potential (E0) of the substrate molecule. On the other hand, the photogenerated
holes on the valence band of the semiconductor material could oxidize
the other substrate molecule if the valence band level (Ev) is more positive than E0 of the substrate molecule. In the photocatalytic field, Butler and
co-workers reported that nitrite was oxidized to nitrate using TiO2 as the photocatalyst.9 With the
assistance of oxalic acid or sodium oxalate as a hole scavenger and
Au, Ag, and Pd as cocatalysts on TiO2, nitrite was reduced
to ammonia and nitrogen gas or oxidized to nitrate.10,11 Kominami et al. utilized a metal-free TiO2 suspension
to reduce nitrite to N2 using ammonia as a hole scavenger
in the atmosphere of argon and investigated the effect of temperature
on the reaction of ammonia and nitrite.12 Other photocatalysts such as CuInS2, KTaO3, LiNbO3, and BaLa4Ti4O15 have been developed to photocatalytically reduce nitrate.13−16 The studies are very valuable and interesting. However, ZnFe2O4/activated carbon (AC) used as a photocatalyst
for simultaneous removal of NO2– and
NH3 has not been reported and a mimicking process for removal
of nitrogen has not been developed neither.

Among photocatalysts,
zinc ferrite (ZnFe2O4) possesses a prominent
feature with a direct band gap of 1.98 eV. Ec of ZnFe2O4 was −0.90
V versus normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), and Ev was 1.08 V.17,18 As a result, it is often utilized
for photocatalytic oxidization of organic pollutants,19−25 reduction of carbon dioxide,26 nitroaromatic
compounds,27 and hydrogen production.28−30 Therefore, it is reasonable that the photogenerated electrons on
the conduction band of ZnF2O4 could reduce NO2– (Ec is less
negative than the standard electrode potential , which is equal to
1.52 V vs NHE) and the
photoholes on the valence band of ZnFe2O4 could
oxidize NH3 in theory (Ev is
more positive than the standard electrode potential , which is equal to
0.057 V vs NHE). According
to the theoretical analysis and facts above, we designed the photocatalytic
simultaneous removal of nitrite and ammonia via coupling zinc ferrite
and AC to form a zinc ferrite/AC (ZnFe2O4/AC)
hybrid catalyst, which can mimic the denitrification process under
anaerobic conditions, simultaneously removing nitrite and ammonia
under UV–visible light irradiation, and the nitrification process
under aerobic conditions to eliminate residual ammonia. AC is utilized
to enhance the photocatalytic activity because it can adsorb the substrate
molecules and promote the separation of photogenerated electron–hole
pairs.31−35 The mimicking process can eliminate two toxic species, without addition
of a carbon source, in addition to being cost-effective.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 X-ray Diffraction Characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of ZnFe2O4/AC, ZnFe2O4, and AC samples are shown in Figure 1. The diffraction
peaks located at 2θ = 29.7°, 35.0°, 42.7°, 53.0°,
56.5°, 62.0°, 70.4°, and 73.3° corresponded to
the Bragg reflections from the (220), (311), (400), (422), (511),
(440), (620), and (533) crystal planes of spinel-structured ZnFe2O4 (JCPDS card no. 22-1012),36−38 respectively.
The peak at 26.2° is attributed to the (002) plane of graphene
in AC. Compared with curve a, a small peak appeared in curve c, indicating
the presence of AC in the ZnFe2O4/AC sample.
The average diameters (D) of the samples could be
estimated using Scherrer equation. 1  Here, W is the breadth of
the observed diffraction peak at its half height, K is the shape factor (usually approximately 0.89), and λ is
the wavelength of the X-ray source used (0.154 nm by our measurement).
The results displayed that the D values of ZnFe2O4/AC and ZnFe2O4 particles
were 6.9 and 7.2 nm, respectively. The size was confirmed by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) observations.

ZnFe2O4 (b), and
ZnFe2O4/AC (c) samples.

2.2 Morphological Observation
The morphological
and structural characteristics of AC, ZnFe2O4, and ZnFe2O4/AC species were analyzed through
TEM observation. Figure 2A,B shows AC images. Figure 2C displays the ZnFe2O4 particles clearly;
the size is very uniform, ranging from 6 to 9 nm, also consistent
with those measured by XRD. Compared with Figure 2B (there is only AC), black ZnFe2O4 particles can been seen in Figure 2D, and the indistinct interface between ZnFe2O4 and AC shows their compact bonding. It is reasonable
that Fe(III) and Zn(II) ions were adsorbed to porous caves of AC material
during continuous stirring. AC functioned as templates by incorporating
ZnFe2O4 precursors, yielding ZnFe2O4 in porous caves of AC. The high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM) image in Figure 2E shows the distinct lattice fringes; the
interplanar spacing between the adjacent lattice fringes is 0.25 nm,
which is assigned to plane (311) of ZnFe2O4.38−40 A 0.29 nm d-spacing is attributed to plane (220)
of ZnFe2O4 particles in Figure 2F,;the particles were embedded in AC, showing
that the ZnFe2O4 particles were grown in caves
of AC.

ZnFe2O4/AC (d) and HRTEM images of ZnFe2O4 (e) and ZnFe2O4/AC (f).

2.3 Raman
Spectroscopic Characterization
The Raman spectra of AC, ZnFe2O4, and ZnFe2O4/AC samples
are presented in Figure 3. Well-resolved Raman scattering
peaks of ZnFe2O4 and ZnFe2O4/AC were observed at 337, 478, and 650 cm–1. The
Raman peak at 650 cm–1 is attributed to the movement
(mode A1g) of oxygen in tetrahedral AO4 groups,
while the two low-frequency peaks are ascribed to metal ion vibration
(mode F2g) involved in octahedral sites (BO6).41−43 The peaks at around 1320 and 1600 cm–1 correspond to the D band and G band of AC, respectively, in which
the D band was caused by disordered sp3-bonded carbon atoms
in the graphitic structure and the G band was caused by sp2-bonded carbon atoms in the graphitic structure.44 The large intensity ratio of ID/IG (round 1.3:1) for AC verified the
amorphous nature of carbon.45

2.4 Band Gap and Band Structure
The optical
absorption property of a semiconductor material reflects the ability
of harvesting photos, thereby playing a significant role in determining
the photocatalytic activity. The diffuse reflectance spectroscopy
(DRS) spectra of the ZnFe2O4/AC and ZnFe2O4 samples have been measured and are shown in Figure 4A. Compared with
curve b in Figure 4A, an enhanced absorption portion appeared in the wavelength region
of more than 530 nm as displayed in curve a, implying that AC on ZnFe2O4 enhanced the absorption efficiency of incident
photons. It will improve the use of solar irradiation.

reflectance absorption spectra (A) of ZnFe2O4/AC (a) and ZnFe2O4 (b)
samples. Tauc plots for direct transition of ZnFe2O4/AC (B).

The direct and indirect
band gaps of a semiconductor material can
be determined by Tauc relation 2  where A is a constant, hv is the photon energy, and α
is the absorption coefficient,
while n = 2 for direct and n = 1/2
for indirect transition. A Tauc plot for direct transition was obtained
by transforming data in Figure 4A and is shown in Figure 4B. The as-obtained direct band gaps for ZnFe2O4 and the ZnFe2O4/AC composite
are 2.1 eV and 2.0 eV, respectively. The band gap for ZnFe2O4 was also confirmed by the first-principles calculation
as shown in Figure 5A. As seen in Figure 5A, the direct transition at G point is equal to
1.968 eV, which is close to the measured value of 2.1 eV. In addition,
the band gap is related to particle size when the diameter of particles
falls in the nanometer scale. The larger the band gap is, the smaller
the particle size is due to the quantum confinement effects, although
the band gap is not inversely proportional to the size of particles.46,47 ZnFe2O4 particles with approximate 10 nm size
showed 1.78 eV of band gap,24 while the
present ZnFe2O4 with approximate 7 nm displayed
2.1 eV of band gap, which confirmed the existence of quantum confinement
effects in the system. Also, as seen in Figure 5B and Figure S1 in Supporting Information, the valence band is majorly composed of O 2p orbitals
and the conduction band is majorly composed of Fe 3d orbitals; thus,
the electron transition takes place from O 2p orbitals to Fe 3d orbitals
upon UV–visible light irradiation.

2.5 Photocatalytic
Removal of Nitrite and Ammonia
The concentrations of nitrite
and ammonia were measured using ultraviolet
visible spectroscopy based on Schemes 1 and 2 during the photocatalytic
process under anaerobic conditions.48

Scheme 1 Reactions for the Measurement of Nitrite
Scheme 2 Reaction for the Measurement of Ammonia
The as-recorded ultraviolet visible absorption
spectra for nitrite
and ammonia are presented in Figure 6A,B at 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 h, respectively. Figure 6A,B displayed unambiguously
that the concentrations of nitrite and ammonia declined simultaneously
with irradiation time under anaerobic conditions when ZnFe2O4/AC was utilized as the photocatalyst. The control tests
were also conducted in the presence or absence of the ZnFe2O4/AC catalyst upon irradiation or in dark or in the absence
of one component; the removal ratios for nitrite and ammonia are presented
in Figure 6C,D, respectively.
Curve a in Figure 6C shows an average removal ratio of 92.7% with ±0.2% error (three
times) for nitrite degradation using ZnFe2O4/AC as the photocatalyst in the presence of 50.0 mg/L nitrite–N
(NO2––N, NN) + 100.0 mg ammonia–N
(NH3–N, AN) under irradiation for 3 h, whereas the
removal ratio approaches only 20.5% (curve b) in the absence of the
catalyst under similar conditions. Parallel to the case of nitrite,
the average removal ratio for degradation of ammonia for three times
achieved 64.3% in the presence of ZnFe2O4/AC
upon irradiation, whereas the removal ratio was only 18.8% in the
absence of ZnFe2O4/AC even upon irradiation
as shown in curve a and b in Figure 6D. It indicates distinctly that ZnFe2O4/AC possessed a photocatalytic feature for the simultaneous
removal of nitrite and ammonia.

Figure 6 The as-recorded ultraviolet–visible
absorption spectra of
nitrite (A) and ammonia (B) under anaerobic conditions in the presence
of the ZnFe2O4/AC photocatalyst at various irradiation
times. Photocatalytic removal of NN (C) and AN (D) under anaerobic
conditions using 1.5 g/L ZnFe2O4/AC (AC 7 wt
%) as the catalyst in 250.0 mL of solution with pH 9.5. The initial
concentrations of NN and AN are 50.0 and 100.0 mg/L, respectively.
(a) NN + AN + ZnFe2O4/AC under light irradiation;
(b) NN + AN under light irradiation without ZnFe2O4/AC; (c) NN + ZnFe2O4/AC under light
irradiation; (d) NN + AN + ZnFe2O4/AC in dark;
and (e) AN + ZnFe2O4/AC under light irradiation.

A control test displayed that
the concentration of nitrite almost
remained constant in the absence of ammonia even under light irradiation
and that only 4.5% of nitrite was adsorbed on the catalyst in 3 h
(curve c in Figure 6C). Nitrite (4.5%, 3 h) and ammonia (16.5%, 3 h) can also be adsorbed
simultaneously on the ZnFe2O4/AC catalyst but
were not degraded in dark as shown in curve d in Figure 6C,D. Taking curve d to compare
with curve a, light irradiation promotes the reaction of nitrite with
ammonia in the presence of the ZnFe2O4/AC catalyst
under the lack of dissolved oxygen. Curve e in Figure 6D shows that ammonia cannot almost be oxidized
in the absence of nitrite or dissolved oxygen under irradiation even
if the ZnFe2O4/AC catalyst is present in the
system.

By analyzing the data above, it can be concluded that
ZnFe2O4/AC can remove nitrite and ammonia simultaneously
under anaerobic conditions upon UV–visible light irradiation.

2.6 Effect of AC Dosage on Photocatalytic Efficiency
Generally, carbon materials can markedly improve the photocatalytic
process, largely through the four following mechanisms: (i) minimization
of the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs;
(ii) modification of the band gap of the photocatalyst to longer wavelengths;
(iii) adsorption that accelerate contact between the pollutant and
catalyst; and (iv) catalysis of the carboxyl group.49 Rivera-Utrilla compared the enhanced effect of ordinary
AC with that of AC oxidized with H2O2, HNO3, and O3 and concluded that AC with the greatest
carboxyl group content showed the highest synergistic activity, whereas
the enhanced effect of ordinary AC that had not been oxidized with
oxidants was mainly attributed to its high adsorption capacity.50 In the present case, a series of ZnFe2O4/AC hybrid catalysts containing various weight ratios
of AC from 0.0 to 9.0% were synthesized using the abovementioned method;
the resulting products were utilized as photocatalysts for the removal
of nitrite and ammonia under anaerobic conditions. The removal curves
are shown in Figure 7. The results show that the removal ratios increased as the weight
ratio of AC (AC: ZnFe2O4) in the composite rose
at the initial stage and that they reached the summit value of 92.7%
(±0.2%) for nitrite and 64.3% (±0.2%) for ammonia when the
AC content was equal to 7.0%. Subsequently, contrary to what was expected,
the removal ratios decreased slightly as the AC content continued
to increase; the removal ratio is 90.0% (±0.2%) for nitrite and
63.0% (±0.2%) for ammonia at AC 9.0 wt %. Thus, 7.0% is the optimal
weight ratio. The control test indicated that pure ZnFe2O4 (0.1 g) displayed average adsorption percentages of
0.2 and 12.0% for NN and AN in a mixed solution containing 50.0 mg/L
NN and 100.0 mg/L AN at 3 h, respectively, whereas the as-prepared
ZnFe2O4/AC (0.1 g) displayed adsorption ratios
of 4.5 and 16.5% for NN and AN in the same mixed solution at 3 h,
respectively. Compared with the adsorption ratios of NN and AN on
ZnFe2O4, the adsorption ratios of NN and AN
on ZnFe2O4/AC are high, showing the concentration
role of AC for NN and AN. Moreover, the photocatalytic removal difference
between ZnFe2O4/AC and pure ZnFe2O4 is 12.7% for NN and 14.4% for AN. The differences of
photocatalytic removal are much larger than those of adsorption. Therefore,
AC improved the adsorption of NN and AN and harvesting of incident
light of λ > 530 nm wavelength, resulting in the enhanced
photocatalytic
activity.51,52

Figure 7 Effects of AC content on the removal of nitrite
(A) and ammonia
(B) under anaerobic conditions upon UV–visible light irradiation.
A 250.0 mL solution was utilized containing 50.0 mg/L NN + 100.0 mg/L
AN + 1.5 g/L ZnFe2O4/AC with pH 9.5.

2.7 Effect of pH on the Removal
of Nitrite and
Ammonia
The hydrogen ion concentration (pH) exerts great
impact on both reduction of nitrite and oxidization of ammonia because
their reactions involved transfer of hydrogen ions. Thus, pH influence
was examined. The results showed that different pHs caused various
removal ratios of both NN and AN for three runs shown in Figure 8.

Figure 8 Effect of pH on the removal
of nitrite (A) and ammonia (B) under
anaerobic conditions upon UV–visible light irradiation. A 250.0
mL solution was utilized containing 50.0 mg/L NN + 100 mg/L AN + 1.5
g/L ZnFe2O4/AC with various pHs of 8.5, 9.0,
9.5, 10.0, and 10.5.

For the removal of nitrite, 54.7% (±0.2%) of NN removal
was
achieved in pH 8.5 solutions during UV–visible light irradiation
for 180 min. In pH 9.0 solutions, 75.2% (±0.2%) removal ratio
was achieved. When pH 9.5 solutions were tested, 92.7% (±0.2%)
removal ratio was achieved, which is a higher value of degradation.
On the contrary, the removal ratio will decline if pH continues to
rise. The removal ratio declined to 81.0% (±0.2%) at pH 10.0,
even to 40.0% (±0.2%) at pH 10.5. For the removal of ammonia,
a similar event took place as shown in Figure 8B. At the initial stage, the removal ratio
of ammonia went upward as pH rose until a value of 64.0% (±0.2%)
was achieved at pH 9.5. After that the removal ratio started to descend,
even to 36.5% (±0.2%) at pH 10.5.

According to the ultraviolet–visible
spectroscopic measurements,
nitrogen gas was formed during the photocatalytic process. As it will
be seen below, the oxidization of NH3 will release hydrogen
ions out in solution (Scheme 3), so the high pH (low concentration of H+ ions)
in solution will promote oxidation of NH3 in a viewpoint
of chemical equilibrium. On the other hand, hydrogen ions involve
in the reduction of nitrite as shown in Scheme 4. Thus, the extortionate pH value resulted
in the declined removal. In this case, the optimal pH value in solution
turns out to be equal to 9.5.

Scheme 3 Photogenerated Holes on Ev Oxidize Ammonia
Scheme 4 Photogenerated Electrons on Ec Reduce
Nitrite
In addition, it seems
that the high concentration of hydrogen ions
favors the overall reaction (Scheme 5). However, the increase of hydrogen ions favors only
the reduction of nitrite, but the oxidization of ammonia will get
deteriorated, which is similar to ammonia oxidized photocatalytically
by graphene–manganese ferrite.34 The possible reason is related to NH3 adsorbed on the
catalyst. NH3, but not NH4+, is the
predominant form in pH > 9.3 solutions because pKa for NH4+ is equal to 9.3. NH3 molecules containing lone pairs of electrons in sp3 hybrid orbitals for donation are more easily adsorbed on the ZnFe2O4 catalyst than NH4+ ions
without lone pairs of electrons. Therefore, NH3 adsorbed
on the catalyst will sacrifice the photogenerated holes so that the
overall reaction continues to occur.

Scheme 5 Overall Photocatalytic
Reaction for the Simultaneous Removal of Nitrite
and Ammonia
2.8 Complete
Removal of Total Nitrogen
At the first stage, nitrite was
reduced to nitrogen gas in the presence
of ammonia under anaerobic conditions upon irradiation; the average
removal ratio of nitrite for three runs reached to 93.3% with ±0.2%
error in 3 h; simultaneously, the average removal ratio of ammonia
for three runs approached to 64.5% with ±0.2% error. That is,
the remaining ammonia of 35.5 mg/L in the solution needs to be degraded
to achieve the complete removal of nitrogen. Thus, at the second stage,
the solution containing 35.5 mg/L AN was aerated for 20 min; then,
the lamp was switched on to continue the removal of the remaining
ammonia. The results are shown in Figure 9. At the 12th hour during irradiation, the
average removal ratios of NN, total nitrogen (TN), and AN for three
runs reached to 92.0, 90.2, and 90.0% with ±0.2% error, respectively,
removing most of total nitrogen. In addition, the removal ratios of
NN and AN at the end of the first stage are about 6.9 and 13.2%, respectively,
and the removal of AN is about 20.4% at the end of the second stage,
when P25 (TiO2) was used as the photocatalyst. It turns
out that ZnFe2O4/AC is very effective in the
removal of NN and AN under similar conditions, compared with P25.

photocatalysis.

2.9 Identification
of Products
To identify
the products of nitrite reaction with ammonia during photocatalysis,
measurements were performed during the photocatalytic removal of nitrite
and ammonia in the sealed photocatalytic reaction system mentioned
previously, in which a 100 mL aqueous solution containing 50.0 mg/L
NO2––N and 100.0 mg/L NH3–N was irradiated under UV–visible light, the mixed
gas of oxygen and argon was cycled, and the produced N2 and others were detected by gas chromatography. The results are
displayed in Figure 10. As seen, the peak of N2 gas was boosting with the irradiation
time, whereas the peak of O2 gas in the sealed reaction
system was declining with the irradiation time; meanwhile, no other
gas peaks such as N2O, NO, and NO2 were observed,
indicating that the product N2 gas was formed during the
photocatalysis of nitrite and ammonia.

photocatalytic simultaneous removal of
nitrite and ammonia via the zinc ferrite/AC hybrid catalyst under
UV–visible light irradiation at t = 0.0, 1.0,
2.0, 3.0, 5.0, 7.0, 9.0, 11.0, and 13.0 h.

2.10 Photocatalytic Reaction Mechanism
The valence band spectrum of ZnFe2O4 was measured
by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) technique as shown in Figure 11. The measured
results indicated that the valence band of ZnFe2O4 is equal to 1.33 eV, which is very close to 1.08 eV,17 so the conduction band is equal to −0.65
eV. It is well known that photogenerated holes may oxidize water to
O2 when Ev is more
positve than E(O2/H2O), whereas photogenerated
electrons may reduce hydrogen ions to H2 when Ec is more
negative than E(H2/H2O).53

Figure 11 XPS valence band spectrum of the ZnFe2O4 sample.

For the oxidization
of NH3 (Scheme 3), the driving power ΔE1 is found to be 1.27 V () because of the standard
electrode potential
() of 0.057 V versus
NHE. For the reduction
of NO2– (Scheme 4), the drive power ΔE2 is 2.17 V () because of the standard electrode
potential
() being 1.52 V versus
NHE. Here, the oxidization
of NH3 to N2 by photogenerated holes is similar
to the oxidization of H2O to O2 by photogenerated
holes,54,55 whereas the reduction of NO2– to N2 by photogenerated electrons is similar
to the reduction of H+ ions to H2.56 Reactions 3 and 4 can both occur spontaneously in energy because both
ΔE1 and ΔE2 are more than zero. Thus, the overall reaction is denoted
in Scheme 5; the overall
photocatalytic process is presented in Figure 12.

gas by means of photocatalysis.

3 Conclusions
Simultaneous removal of
nitrite and ammonia was achieved successfully
based on the zinc ferrite/AC catalyst via two steps under UV–visible
light irradiation. The detection of products by means of gas chromatography
indicated that nitrogen gas was released out during photocatalysis.
The XPS measurements and analysis of the band structure for ZnFe2O4 showed that Ec (−0.65
V vs NHE) of ZnFe2O4 is lower than the reduced
potential (1.52 V vs NHE) of nitrite and thereby the photogenerated
electrons can reduce nitrite to N2 gas under irradiation;
while Ev (1.33 V vs NHE) of ZnFe2O4 is higher than the potential (0.057 V vs NHE) of ammonia,
as a result, the photogenerated holes can oxidize ammonia to N2 gas. AC caused the red shift of the band gap, separation
of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs, and adsorption for
nitrite and ammonia, promoting the photocatalytic activity.

in 10.0 mL of deionized water by ultrasonic dispersion for 1 h. The
as-prepared solution containing Zn(II) and Fe(III) was added to 10
mL of the AC aqueous suspension; then, it was vigorously stirred for
1 h. Finally, a 10.0 mL solution containing 2.40 g of NaOH was slowly
added dropwise to the above brown suspension with continuous stirring
for 1.5 h. Deionized water (20.0 mL) was also added to the suspension
to obtain a total volume of 60 mL. The suspension was transferred
into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, which was sealed
and heated at 180 °C for 8 h. Then, it was cooled naturally to
room temperature, taken out, and filtered to obtain ZnFe2O4/AC precipitates. The ZnFe2O4/AC
precipitates were washed thrice with deionized water to remove excess
NaOH and other electrolytes. The precipitates were collected and dried
at 60 °C for 24 h in a vacuum chamber for characterization and
photocatalytic tests.

4.3 Structure Characterization
of ZnFe2O4/AC
XRD measurements were
performed using an
X’Pert-Pro MPD X-ray diffractometer (Panalytical, Netherlands).
The X-ray source was Cu Kα radiation with a wavelength of 0.154
nm, tube voltage of 40 kV, and tube current of 40 mA. ZnFe2O4/AC, ZnFe2O4, and AC powder were
dispersed in water by using an ultrasonic device, placed on carbon-coated
copper grids, and dried under ambient conditions for morphological
observations using a TEM system (Tecnai G220, FEI, USA). UV–vis
DRS spectra were recorded on a double-beam TU-1901 spectrophotometer
(type T1901, Puxi Co., Beijing, China). Raman spectra were recorded
on an HR800 micro-confocal Raman spectrometer with a 633 nm laser.

4.4 Simultaneous Removal of Nitrite and Ammonia
The experiments for the removal of nitrite and ammonia were performed
using a commercial glass photoreactor (Shanghai Binlong Instrument
Co. Ltd.) as shown in Figure 13. A high-pressure mercury lamp (300 W), surrounded by a flow
of water to maintain 25 °C (the temperature in the reaction solution
is 28 °C as measured by the thermometer), was inserted in a 250
mL suspension solution containing NN (50 mg/L), AN (100 mg/L), and
1.5 g/L ZnFe2O4/AC catalyst. The pH of the suspension
was adjusted to 9.5 using 1.0 mol/L NaOH solution. The suspension
was bubbled with nitrogen gas at a flow rate of 0.3 L min–1 for 30 min to remove dissolved oxygen for photocatalytic tests under
magnetic stirring. Solution (3 mL) was taken out to determine the
concentrations of nitrite, ammonia, or nitrate at the interval of
0.5 h.

Figure 13 Experimental apparatus for the simultaneous removal of nitrite
and ammonia.

To achieve complete
removal of nitrogen, after nitrite was reduced
by ammonia photocatalytically, NaOH was added to the suspension solution
to maintain pH 9.5 and oxygen gas was also pumped into the suspension
solution to provide with dissolved oxygen for degrading the residual
ammonia to achieve the complete removal of total nitrogen.

4.5 Measurements of Nitrite, Nitrate, and Ammonia
A double-beam
TU-1901 spectrophotometer was used to probe the concentrations
of nitrite and ammonia by using Griess reagents58,59 and Nessler reagents60 during photocatalysis,
respectively. Griess reagents contain sulphanilamide and N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine as the coupling agent. Five grams (5.0
g) of sulphanilamide was added to a 400 mL solution containing 36.5
wt % HCl of 50 mL; the solution was diluted to 500 mL. Then, 100.0
mg of N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine was dissolved
in 50 mL of deionized water; it was diluted to 100 mL. The measurement
procedures are as follows: one milliliter (1.0 mL) of the sample solution
containing nitrite was taken out to a 50 mL colorimetric cylinder.
Then, 1.0 mL of sulphanilamide solution was added to the nitrite solution
for 5 min; after that 1.0 mL of N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine
solution was also added the solution to form a red azo dye with an
absorption maximum at 540 nm. Finally, it was diluted to 50 mL for
the measurement at 540 nm. The reactions are presented in Scheme 1. Ammonia reacts
with Nessler reagent to give colored solutions as shown in Scheme 2. The absorbance
at 382 nm approached the peak and was recorded at the wavelength of
382 nm.48

Nitrate was determined
directly at 203 nm using ultraviolet visible spectroscopy.61 The removal ratios of NN, AN, and TN were calculated
using eqs 3–5 3   4   5  where CNN0 is the initial concentration
of NN, CAN0 is the initial concentration of AN, CNNt is the concentration
of NN at t min during the photocatalytic process,
and CANt is
the concentration of AN at t min during the photocatalytic
process.

4.6 Identification of Products
To detect
the products of nitrite reaction with ammonia during photocatalysis,
a sealed photocatalytic reaction system (Labsolar 6A photocatalytic
system, Perfectlight Co. Ltd., Beijing, China) was applied, in which
a 100 mL aqueous solution containing 50.0 mg/L NO2––N + 100.0 mg/L NH3–N was
irradiated under UV–visible light irradiation after the 465
mL reaction system was evacuated to 0.4 kPa. Subsequently, the first
stage of photocatalysis was conducted under 300 W Xe-lamp irradiation
for 2 h. After that a mixed gas with the initial ratio of oxygen to
argon at 1:2.6 was pumped until the internal pressure reached to 80
kPa and then the second stage of photocatalysis continued to occur.
The reaction system was coupled with a GC-7806 gas chromatography
(Shiwei Puxin Instruments Co. Ltd., Beijing, China) system. A chromatographic
column of 5 m length × 2 mm i.d., filled with a 5 Å molecular
sieve was utilized as a separation column. High-purity argon was utilized
as the carrier gas. The flow rate of the carrier gas was set at 23
mL/min. A thermal conductivity tank was used to detect N2, O2, and others. The column temperature was set at 80
°C, inlet temperature at 120 °C, and detector temperature
at 150 °C.

4.7 First-Principles Calculation
The
calculations of band structure and DOS were performed by using the
CASTEP package of Materials Studio 7.0. In the plane-wave calculations,
a cutoff energy of 520 eV was applied. The generalized gradient approximation
was adopted with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional.
The calculations were performed in a ferromagnetic spin-polarized
configuration. The self-consistent field convergence criterion and
energy tolerance were set as fine levels. A Monkhorst–Pack
scheme with a 6 × 6 × 6 k-point grid was
employed. Tkatchenko–Scheffler method was used for DFT-D correction.
The ZnFe2O4 phase is of the cubic structure
with space group Fd3̅m (no.
227) and the lattice parameters a = b = c = 8.4418 Å, and α = β = γ
= 90°, in which the Zn, Fe, and O atoms occupy the fractional
coordinates of Zn1 (0.00, 0.00, 0.00) with site occupation factor
(SOF) 0.89, Fe1 (0.00, 0.00, 0.00) with SOF 0.11, Fe2 (0.625, 0.625,
0.625) with SOF 0.945, Zn2 (0.625, 0.625, 0.625) with SOF 0.055, and
O (0.3854, 0.3854, 0.3854), respectively. These accurate data validated
the applicability of the CASTEP package for calculating the band structures
and DOS of ZnFe2O4.
