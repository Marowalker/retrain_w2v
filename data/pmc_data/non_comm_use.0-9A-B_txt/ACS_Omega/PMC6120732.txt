We
have studied the in vitro stability
of 25 potential i-motif-forming DNA sequences found within the promoter
regions of 18 different human DNA repair genes. Three widely available
methods of characterization were used to rapidly assess i-motif folding
and stability and comprise a simple screen for preliminary identification
of physiologically relevant i-motif forming sequences. Four highly
pH-stable candidate sequences were identified exhibiting pH transitions
(pH at which 50% of the oligodeoxynucleotides in solution are folded)
at or above pH 6.6, thermal melting temperatures above 37 °C
and isothermal UV difference spectra characteristic of 2′-deoxycytidine
imino-nitrogen protonation. These newly identified i-motif forming
sequences could represent novel targets for understanding and modulating
human DNA repair gene expression.

Introduction
The i-motif (iM) is
a noncanonical, tetraplex-type secondary structure formed by cytosine-rich
DNA sequences, in which at least four polycytidine tracks are proximal
to each other; i.e., less than ∼10 nucleotides apart. The core
of the iM tetraplex is composed of hemiprotonated 2′-deoxycytidine
base pairs (dC–dC+) between parallel-oriented segments
of a single DNA strand (Figure 1).1−5 Low pH, i.e., pH 4–6, drives iM formation, and the pH value
at which iM folding occurs is sequence-dependent. The transitional
pH (pHT), defined as the pH at which 50% of a solution
of a given iM-forming sequence is folded, is the key physical parameter
by which an iM’s physiological probability is measured.6 Identifying iM-forming DNA sequences in the human
genome that fold at or near neutral pH is, therefore, of high importance
for deducing potential iM functions in vivo.

Figure 1 Generic model of a DNA
i-motif. Each i-motif (left) is composed of a “core”
of hemiprotonated dC–dC+ base pairs (right) between
parallel-oriented strands of the tetraplex (yellow). There are three
loops and two tails which may be composed of any 2′-deoxynucleotides
(dN). Topology is also defined as either 5′E (shown) or 3′E,
which is determined by the position of the dC–dC+ base pair closest to the 5′ or 3′ end of the sequence,
respectively.

In a genomic sense, potential
iM-forming sequences can be found as the complements of potential
guanine-quadruplex (G4) forming sequences. Over 700 000 potential
G4-forming sequences have been identified within the human genome
using a bioinformatics approach and a high-throughput, G4-specific
chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing assay that identify folded
G4 sequences within the human genome.7,8 Interestingly,
a propensity for potential G4-forming sequences was noted within promoter
regions of genes.8,9 On the basis of this finding and
a variety of experimental data, it has been suggested that certain
G4- and iM-forming sequences serve as transcriptional regulatory elements.10 Though the G4 has received extensive attention
in recent years, iMs have remained less studied, primarily due to
the pH-dependent nature of their folding transition.

Recently,
characterization of endogenous iM-forming oligodeoxynucleotide sequences
within the human genome has revealed a significant propensity for
many endogenous sequences to form at or near neutral pH.11−14 Further, in the case of the BCL2 oncogene promoter
iM, a potential transcriptional regulatory role has been identified
and manipulated in vivo as a druggable target in efforts to modulate
gene expression.15−19 This has led to the idea that iM structures in the human genome
can provide novel drug targets for the regulation of gene expression.10,16,20BCL2 is currently
the most-studied iM-forming sequence, both in vitro and in vivo and
serves as a promising example of the possibilities for iM research
and serves as a primary standard for other iM-forming sequences to
be measured by. For these reasons, the search for iM structures that
are stable in vitro under physiologically relevant conditions remains
a high priority for advancement toward understanding the biological
functions of the DNA iM.

Recent developments employing state-of-the-art
in-cell NMR techniques indicate a high potential for iM-folding activity
in vivo,18,21 and new rules have also been established
to guide the search for physiologically active iM structures based
on perturbations of polycytidine sequences.13,22 Identification of iM-forming sequences, such as poly-dC19 and a poly-dC-like iM-forming sequence within the promoter of RAD17, has also been coupled with detailed investigations
of structural dynamics and folding rate-dependent pHT behavior.13,22,23 As our knowledge of iM-forming
DNA progresses, so too does our ability to efficiently search for
and characterize candidate sequences that have the potential to serve
as regulatory elements within the human genome.

Here, we provide
a concise summary of iM-folding behavior for 25 potential iM-forming
sequences located in 18 DNA repair gene promoters, including the previously
studied RAD17 promoter iM.23 Each iM-forming sequence was identified as the complement to a potential
G4-forming sequence found using the QuadParser bioinformatics tool
with a modified set of search parameters, as described previously
by Fleming et al.24 These sequences were
originally chosen by Fleming et al. due to their presence in the promoter
regions of DNA repair genes involved in stress response due to damage
induced by reactive oxygen species, which is enhanced in G4-forming
sequences. Some of those potential G4-forming sequences were discovered
to have a lower probability of folding, so we wished to characterize
the complementary sequences to determine whether the dC-rich sequences
exhibited different stabilities under physiologically relevant conditions
in vitro. To accomplish this, we employed three spectroscopic methods
of characterization to quantify their pH-dependent stability, thermal
stability, and cytosine protonation state under physiological salt
and buffer conditions to screen for potential physiologically relevant
structures. Each sequence studied varies in polycytidine tract length,
polycytidine tract number, and potential loop lengths showing that
pH-dependent stability can arise from a wide variety of sequence contexts,
confirming some trends previously noted in model studies.

Results and Discussion
Oligodeoxynucleotide
Sequences
Table 1 shows the potential iM-forming human gene promoter sequences
examined in this study presented with the gene name from which each
was extracted along with their polycytidine track lengths and intermediate,
nonpolycytidine track lengths, denoted “loop lengths.”
Some gene promoters contained two distinct iM-forming sequences (denoted
by an appended “sequence #” in Table 1) or multiple polycytidine tracts (denoted
by an appended “# tract” in Table 1). Of note are the 5′ and 3′
flanking sequences of RAD17: sequence 2, which are
three nucleotides in length, rather than the general two nucleotide
flanking sequences in all other oligodeoxynucleotides. This was a
deliberate choice to provide consistency with a previously published
in-depth investigation of that sequence by our laboratory.23

Sequence Features
and Observed pHT Values
pH-dependent circular
dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded for each oligodeoxynucleotide
sequence in Table 1 in triplicate, and a normalized pHT curve was built and
evaluated as described in Materials and Methods (Figures S1–S25). Figure 2 shows the pHT values
(±standard error) for each oligodeoxynucleotide studied. Four
of the characterized iM-forming sequences have pHT values
(Table S1) that are greater than 6.6, the
pHT of the BCL2 iM, which we consider
a primary standard of comparison.11 Stabilities
for the top four followed the order RAD17: sequence
2 (pHT 6.9) > MGMT (pHT 6.7)
≈ UDG-4 track (pHT 6.7) > PCNA: sequence 2 (pHT 6.6).

Figure 2 pHT values
for all oligodeoxynucleotide sequences studied under physiological
salt and buffer concentrations. Error bars represent the standard
error of the calculated pHT determined by propagation of
the errors in fit parameters b1 and b2, taking into account covariance between the
two values. All values and standard errors are presented numerically
in Table S1 as well as the CD λmax value at low pH. For ease of comparison, the figure is
provided immediately above Figure 3 in a combined format in Figure S26, Supporting Information.

The pHT data set shows an apparent trend of increasing
pHT values with increasing numbers of polycytidine tracks
for homologous sequences within a single gene promoter. An exception
is the lower pHT of the UDG-5 track sequence
compared with the UDG-4 track sequence. This is likely
due to the longer separation between the first and second polycytidine
tracks (21 nucleotides) in the UDG-5 track sequence.
Such a long loop is unprecedented, and is likely not involved in the
iM structure itself based on the results of previously reported loop
length investigations. Model studies of polycytidine oligodeoxynucleotides
separated by polythymidine tracks or poly(ethylene glycol) spacers,
which serve as forced loops, show a decrease in stability with longer
loop length.14,22,25−28 Further, the CD spectra of UDG-5 track show the
loss of an experimentally determined ellipticity minimum ca. 265 nm.
We speculate that this indicates the 5′ polycytidine track,
and potential 21 nucleotide loop are likely uninvolved in the iM structure,
though a detailed structural investigation would be necessary to confirm
this.

The identity of the loop nucleotide bases also appears
to conform to previously determined investigations of loop nucleotide
identity relationships to structural stability. For the first and
third loops in model iM-forming sequences, a general preference for
T–T or G–T base pairs has been noted, and sequences
with higher purine content in the loops are generally disfavored.26,29,30 Overall, lower purine content
in the bases composing the loops correlates with a higher pHT in our oligodeoxynucleotide set. All of the NEIL3 and NTHL1 sequences as well as PCNA: sequence 1 and NEIL2-4 track, possess nucleobase loop compositions
that are generally higher in purine content, a feature that has been
observed to disfavor iM formation due to the bulk of purine bases
compared to their pyrimidine counterparts.29

pH-Dependent TM Analysis
All
potential iM-forming sequences were subjected to TM analysis at pHs 5 and 6. The results are summarized
in Figure 3. Representative TM curves
are provided in Figures S1–S25 in
the Supporting Information.

Figure 3 Thermal melting temperatures for all oligodeoxynucleotide
sequences studied at pH 5 (red) and pH 6 (blue) with the standard
error of the mean for each triplicate experiment. Some oligodeoxynucleotide
sequences had no discernible thermal melting temperature above 20
°C. All values are tabulated in Table S1 along with their standard errors. For ease of comparison, Figure 2 is provided immediately
above the figure in a combined format in Figure S26, Supporting Information.

At pH 5, all but the NEIL3-4 track sequence had a discernible TM. This was an unsurprising result considering
that this sequence exhibited the lowest pHT out of all
of the potential iM-forming sequences studied. For all other sequences,
the TM values at pH 5 were greater than
∼40 °C. Interrogation at pH 6, however, showed a significant
number of sequences to be thermally unstable to the point that no TM could be determined. The majority of these
sequences exhibited low pHT values and consequently are
unlikely to have a significant folded population at pH 6.

For
the four highest pH-stability sequences, TM values at pH 6 showed the order RAD17: sequence
2 (60.4 °C) > MGMT (47.7 °C) > PCNA: sequence 2 (45.4 °C) > UDG-4 track (35.0 °C). Interestingly, not all of the highest pH-stable
sequences gave the highest TM values. RAD54L, PCNA: sequence
1, UDG-5 track, XRCC3, RAD21, POLβ, APE1-5 track, FEN1, and NEIL1 all had higher pH 6 TM values than UDG-4 track. Such an observation
is likely due to discrepancies in the sharpness of the pHT curves, where sequences with higher TM values and lower pHT values relative to UDG-4 track indicate a more gradual unfolding transition.

Isothermal
UV Difference Spectra (IDS)
Each oligodeoxynucleotide studied
was further characterized by taking the difference between high pH
(unfolded state) and low pH (folded state) UV spectra, collected concurrently
with pH-dependent CD spectra. The results, shown in Figure 4, are equivalent to those obtained
by thermal UV difference spectroscopy, established as a method to
assess the formation of protonated cytosines.1,31 All
IDS are indicative of the formation of protonated cytosine residues
and further support the probability of iM folding.

IDS for each oligodeoxynucleotide studied. All spectra are qualitative
only and indicative of cytosine protonation. Maxima and minima are
tabulated in Table S1.

High-Stability Sequences
All sequences met the experimental
criteria presented here to be deemed probable iM structures. The candidate
sequences best suited for further investigation, however, are the
four aforementioned high-stability sequences; MGMT, PCNA: sequence 2, RAD17: sequence
2, and UDG-4 track. Of those four, MGMT and RAD17: sequence 2 pose the greatest potential
for further investigation.

The promoter iM of MGMT presents a unique potential for gene regulation pertinent to a number
of different disease states. MGMT is a gene encoding
a protein responsible for the direct, stoichiometric repair of O6-methyl-2′-deoxyguanosine, a primary
mutagenic lesion in DNA.32 Its promoter
region has been described as a prognostic factor in patient response
to alkylating agent chemotherapy, determined by the methylation status
of that region of the gene.33−39 The potential iM-forming sequence studied here contains eight CpG
dinucleotides and is located 75 bases upstream of the transcription
start site. 5-Methyl-2′-deoxycytidine, the methylated DNA epigenetic
marker in CpG dinucleotides, has been shown to slightly enhance the
thermal stability of the human telomere iM and increase the pKa of the imino nitrogen of the nucleobase.40,41 Regardless of whether methylation affects the iM-forming region
within the MGMT promoter, further investigation is
clearly justified to determine its potential for biological activity,
which we have not yet determined.

RAD17: sequence
2 presents a unique sequence context atypical of most iM-forming oligodeoxynucleotides
in that it is composed of two nine-nucleotide polycytidine tracks
separated by a single guanine nucleotide. This is extremely similar
to the recently discovered poly-C19 oligodeoxynucleotide,
which is the most stable polycytidine sequence length currently known.13 The pHT of RAD17:
sequence 2 is nearest to neutral pH out of all of the sequences studied
here and is only slightly lower than that of poly-C19.
The TM values of RAD17:
sequence 2 are also slightly lower than that of poly-C19. This is likely due to the presence of the single guanine nucleotide
in the middle of the polycytidine region, which would likely force
a loop to form and reduce structural dynamics. Given the relatively
high pHT and TM values of these
sequences, further investigations into the stability, folding behavior,
and structure are currently ongoing.

Conclusions
Here,
we have provided a survey of 25 oligodeoxynucleotides extracted from
the promoter regions of 18 DNA repair genes and assessed their folding
behavior and potential for further investigation using standard spectroscopic
methods. Among the oligodeoxynucleotides studied, four were identified
as potential high-stability iM structures relative to the most biologically
investigated iM to date, that in the BCL2 oncogene
promoter.11,15,16 These results
are not an exhaustive characterization of these potential iMs, but
rather are presented as a method of rapidly assessing the potential
for iM folding under physiologically relevant conditions. Among various
endogenous DNA repair gene promoters, the iM could play a regulatory
role important to a variety of DNA damage-related disease states.
Further, our survey shows a variety of sequence contexts that can
give rise to high-stability sequences, which could be useful for designing
intelligent biosensors and pH-responsive devices.

Materials and
Methods
Oligodeoxynucleotides Synthesis and Purification
All
oligodeoxynucleotides used herein were synthesized using standard
phosphoramidite procedures by the DNA synthesis core facility at the
University of Utah. All samples were then treated with 200 mM piperidine
for 30 min at 90 °C prior to purification by high-performance
liquid chromatography using a high pH eluent to prevent iM folding
on column. Samples were then dialyzed 3 × 12 h against ddH2O, lyophilized, resuspended in ddH2O, quantified,
and then frozen as concentrated stock solutions until needed for experiments.
Molar absorptivity values for all oligodeoxynucleotides studied were
determined using the nearest-neighbor method.

Circular Dichroism (CD)
Spectroscopy
CD spectra and pHT values were recorded
and determined, respectively, using a set of Britton–Robinson
buffers (20 mM HOAc, 20 mM H3PO4, 20 mM H3BO3, 140 mM KCl, 12 mM NaCl, pH adjusted with NaOH)
ranging from pH 4.5 to 8 in increments of 0.25 pH units. It should
be noted that Na+ concentrations ranging from 0 to 100
mM can destabilize iM structures by up to 0.4 pH units, and our use
of NaOH as a pH adjustment does place our samples in this range.1 For that reason, internal comparison of our data
set is validated for the work presented here, and cross-examination
with stabilities presented in other studies may not be straightforward.
Concentrated stock oligodeoxynucleotides were spiked into triplicate
samples of 500 μL of each buffer to give a concentration of
∼5 μM, and the pH values were recorded. Each sample was
then loaded into a 2 mm cuvette, and the CD spectrum was recorded.
CD and ultraviolet–visible (UV) spectra were recorded concurrently
from 200 to 320 nm at 21 °C for each scan. The ellipticities
at all wavelengths were converted to molar ellipticity, [θ]
by the equation [θ] = θ × (10 × C × l)−1, where C is the concentration of the sample based on the absorbance at 260
nm in the UV spectrum and l is the path length of
the cuvette. The pHT values were found by nonlinear regression
of normalized ellipticities at the experimentally determined wavelength
maxima ca. 287 nm (low pH) versus pH using the following sigmoid model
equation.  

[x] is the folded
state population at a given pH, and b# is parameter to be fit via nonlinear regression in Matlab. The 95%
confidence intervals (Δ95%) were calculated in addition
to the regression curve itself to provide an accurate representation
of the accuracy of the data set and regression analysis.

Thermal Melting
Temperature Analysis (TM)
Using
the same Britton–Robinson buffer as noted for the CD spectroscopy
screen, UV spectroscopy was used to monitor the heat-induced denaturation
of all sequences studied in triplicate. For each potential iM-forming
sequence in the DNA repair gene screen, pHs 5 and 6 buffers were used.
Stock concentration oligodeoxynucleotides were spiked into the solution
to give a concentration that would result in ∼0.20–0.25
absorbance units at 262 nm (∼1–3.5 μM for all
ODNs) to inhibit intermolecular structure formation. Each solution
was equilibrated at 20 °C (DNA repair gene sequences for the
screen) for 5 min and then heated at 1 °C min–1, paused for 30 s after a 1 °C increase in temperature, and
the UV absorbance recorded at 262 nm. This was continued to a final
temperature of 100 °C. The derivative method was then used to
analyze the resultant thermally induced denaturation curves at 262
nm.

Isothermal Difference Spectroscopy
During CD spectroscopic
experiments, the UV spectrum was recorded concurrently with each CD
spectrum. The UV spectra for the lowest and highest pH scans were
subtracted from one another according to protocols established in
the literature for thermal difference spectra and isothermal difference
spectra (IDS).31 The results of this approach
are identical to those obtained via the thermal method described by
Mergny and co-workers and are characteristic of the protonation state
of 2′-deoxycytidine residues.1 The
only differentiating factor between a thermal and isothermal difference
spectrum is that the unfolded random coil state is obtained thermally
in a thermal difference spectrum and is obtained via pH-induced unfolding
in the isothermal difference spectrum.
