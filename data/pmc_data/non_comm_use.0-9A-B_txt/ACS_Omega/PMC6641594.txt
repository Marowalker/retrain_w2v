The
present article reports the development of sunlight-mediated
rapid synthesis of bile acid derived dicationic amphiphiles, namely,
dicationic cysteamine-conjugated cholic acid (DCaC), dicationic cysteamine-conjugated
deoxycholic acid (DCaDC), and dicationic cysteamine-conjugated lithocholic
acid (DCaLC) by adopting thiol–yne click chemistry approach.
The auric chloride (AuHCl4) induced micellization of amphiphiles
from fractal pattern to chainlike aggregates was examined by critical
micelle concentration measurements, quenching studies, field emission
scanning electron microscopy, and optical microscopy techniques. The
micelles thus formed act as ideal templates for the stabilization
of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and exhibit good stability for more
than 6 months. The synthesized AuNPs were characterized using UV–visible
spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, DLS,
zeta potential, and contact angle measurements. These NPs showed high
salt tolerance, and the levels were found to be 420, 460, and 580
mM for DCaC-, DCaDC-, and DCaLC-capped AuNPs, respectively.

Introduction
Self-assembly
of hierarchically ordered structures is a fascinating
subject, in which small entities into larger two- or three-dimensional (3D) structures
exhibiting new features that cannot be achieved by the isolated building
blocks.1,2 Nature uses a highly ordered self-assembled
structure to construct the functional hybrid materials from inorganic
and organic building blocks.3,4 The artificial synthesis
of hierarchically self-assembled nanoscale building blocks such as
nanoclusters, nanowires, nanobelts, and nanotubes is the versatile
technique available for the fabrication of functional electronic and
photonic nanodevices.5,6 Fractal structures are extremely
familiar in nature with different scales of lengths from self-assembled
molecules, to the shapes of coastlines, to the distribution of galaxies,
and even to the 3D shapes of clouds.7 They
are never-ending patterns and are attained by repeating a simple process
over and over in an ongoing reaction loop driven by recursion. Investigation
of such hierarchically self-assembled fractal patterns in chemical
systems provides a unique size, shape, and chemical functionality,
which paves way for new opportunities in the design and fabrication
of novel functional nanomaterials.8

Self-assembled amphiphilic molecule-templated noble metal nanostructures
have attracted considerable research interest over the past 2 decades
because of their striking properties and numerous promising applications
in the field of biomedical sciences, catalysis, and optoelectronics.9−13 A variety of amphiphilic molecules such as surfactants, lipids,
glycolipids, biological macromolecules, amphiphilic polymers, and
dendrimers could self-assemble under appropriate conditions that they
have been used as templates for the synthesis of different metal nanoparticles
(MNPs).14−17 Among these nanomaterials, gold NPs (AuNPs) have drawn remarkable
interest as they exhibit unique size- and shape-dependent catalytic
activity, intense surface plasmon resonance (SPR) in the visible region,
electrical properties, high dispersibility in aqueous medium, chemical
inertness, and biocompatibility.18−20 Because of these various
versatile properties, AuNPs have been used as promising key materials
for chemical and biological applications, such as drug delivery and
therapeutics, sensing, labeling, imaging, and photodynamic therapy.21−23 Keeping the biological perspective in mind, many efforts have been
devoted to develop an environmentally benign synthetic approach using
a clean, eco-friendly reducing, and capping agent and an environmentally
suitable solvent system for the preparation of AuNPs.24,25 Recent studies have shown that the size, shape, stability of the
colloids, and surface functionality of NPs play vital roles in their
entry and subsequent access of the NPs into living cells.26−28

Inspired by the interaction of positively charged NPs with
biological
systems, in the present investigation, for the first time, we have
attempted to synthesize cysteamine-conjugated dicationic bile acid
based amphiphiles and to stabilize AuNPs using sunlight. Bile acids
are naturally available biosurfactants in mammals, which provide an
important function in the digestion of fats and lipids. Unlike conventional
surfactant molecules, bile acids consist of special amphiphilicity,
chirality, rigid steroidal skeleton, biocompatibility, chemically
nonequivalent hydroxyl groups, and easily modifiable carboxylic group,
making them ideal building blocks for the stabilization of metal NPs.29,30 The cysteamine-conjugated dicationic bile salts were prepared by
adopting our previously reported method with a minor modification.31 The prepared dicationic amphiphiles (DCAmps)
showed hierarchically self-assembled patterns upon varying the concentrations
ranging from below to above critical micelle concentration (CMC).
In below CMC, these DCAmps exhibited self-assembled fractal patterns
such as fractal grass and dendritic and fern leaf-like fractals, which
were used as effective templates for the stabilization of AuNPs. Hence,
in the present investigation, the preliminary studies of auric chloride
(HAuCl4) induced aggregation properties of fractal patterns
and the stabilization of AuNPs were extensively studied.

Results and Discussion
Effect
of Substrate Concentration on the AuNP Formation
DCAmps were
synthesized via a simple thiol–yne click reaction
between propargylated bile acid and cysteamine hydrochloride under
sunlight, as shown in Scheme 1, and the synthesized amphiphiles act as capping and stabilizing
agents for the preparation of AuNPs. Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis)
absorption spectroscopy is an important and most commonly used technique
to ascertain the formation and stability of MNPs. In aqueous medium,
these DCAmps exhibit a hierarchical self-assembled structure upon
increase in the concentration from below to above CMC. In below CMC,
these amphiphiles exhibit different fractal patterns, which could
be attributed to the influence of hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions.31Figure 1 shows the UV–vis absorption spectra of AuNP formation
in the presence of different concentrations of amphiphiles in aqueous
medium under sunlight exposure without any additional reducing agent.
In all cases, a broad and weak SPR band was observed when the concentration
of these amphiphiles becomes very low. Upon increase in the concentration,
the intensity of the SPR band increases along with a small blue shift
and it attained maximum when the concentration of the template reached
below CMC [1 × 10–4 M for dicationic cysteamine-conjugated
cholic acid (DCaC); 2 × 10–4 M for dicationic
cysteamine-conjugated deoxycholic acid (DCaDC); and 8.3 × 10–5 M for dicationic cysteamine-conjugated lithocholic
acid (DCaLC)]. However, further increase in the concentration of CMC
results in a decrease in the intensity of the SPR band significantly
along with a small shift toward longer wavelength region for all systems.
The variation seen in the peak position and the intensity of SPR band
with respect to the substrate concentration could be due to the influence
of hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions on the formation of different
sized NPs. Accordingly, the color of AuNP solution changed, as shown
in the inset of Figure 1. Furthermore, in above CMC, except for DCaLC, no SPR band was observed,
which can be explained by the changes observed in the characteristic
peak intensity of AuCl4– ions in the
absorption spectrum (Figure S1). All systems,
up to below CMC, show no evidence for the characteristic peak of AuCl4– ions between 200 and 400 nm, which could
be attributed to the complete reduction of Au3+ ions to
form AuNPs. However, a broad absorption band was clearly observed
in this region, in above CMC for DCaC than the DCaDC and DCaLC; this
could be due to the formation of stable ion-pair complex between dicationic
bile salts and AuCl4– ions, which were
effectively trapped in the micellar assemblies that are not assessable
for the reduction of gold precursor (Figure S1a,b). To optimize the reaction conditions, NP formation was demonstrated
at optimized concentration of HAuCl4 (1 × 10–3 M) with dicationic bile salts (1 × 10–4 M
for DCaC; 2 × 10–4 M for DCaDC; and 8.3 ×
10–5 M for DCaLC) under ambient conditions in the
laboratory and under UV light and sunlight exposure, suggesting that
the sunlight exposure produced a narrow SPR peak with high intensity
(Figure S2) and the prepared NPs were stable
at room temperature for more than 6 months without any noticeable
color changes. Previously, Dong et al. have proposed the mechanism
of photochemical reduction in the synthesis of spherical shaped AuNPs
by using poly(ethylene glycol).32 Also,
Pienpinijtham et al. have synthesized micrometer-sized gold nanoplates
by starch-mediated photochemical reduction of AuCl4.33 Herein, we report to explain the interaction
of DCAmps with AuCl4– under sunlight
irradiation by adapting their mechanism. In aqueous medium, DCAmp
and AuCl4– form the [AuCl4––DCAmp] ion-pair complex through electrostatic
interactions. Under sunlight irradiation, [AuCl4––DCAmp] complex is activated and subsequently the Au3+ ion is reduced to Au(0) by gaining an electron from a chloride ion
and releasing a chloride radical from the complex, as shown in Scheme 2.

Formation
Effect of pH on the AuNP
Formation
The effect of pH
plays a significant role in the formation and stabilization of NPs
because of the availability of pH-sensitive functional groups such
as hydroxyl (OH) and ammonium chloride (NH3+). These functional groups act as active sites for the reduction
of metal salts and the stabilization of NPs. As the pH of the medium
was increased from 2.0 to 4.0 for DCaC-stabilized AuNPs, the intensity
of the SPR band decreases significantly along with a small shift toward
the lower wavelength region and the resulting band becomes narrow.
Above this pH, no shift was observed in λmax and
the obtained spectra become slightly broadened (Figure S3a). In the case of DCaDC-stabilized NPs, the intensity
of the SPR band slightly increases upon increase in the pH from 2.0
to 4.0 and it reached a maximum when the pH of the medium becomes
4.5. Beyond this pH, the intensity of the peak slightly decreases,
which could be due to the decrease in the reducing capability of these
functional groups on the NP formation (Figure S3b). Similarly, for DCaLC-stabilized NPs, the SPR peak intensity
increases as the pH increased from 2.0 to 4.5. Above this, there was
a steady decrease in the SPR intensity and the resulting spectra become
broadened (Figure S3c). To check the stability
of the synthesized NPs, the solutions were kept at room temperature
for more than 6 months, in which the DCaC-capped NPs show good stability
only at pH 4.5 in comparison to other pHs (inset of Figure S3a). The DCaDC-stabilized NPs were highly stable in
the range of pH 3.0–4.5 (inset of Figure S3b). In the case of DCaLC-stabilized NPs, the pink color of
the solution remains the same only at pH 3.5, and below and above
this pH, the color of the solution slightly changed to purple, indicating
the formation of aggregates (inset of Figure S3c). In all cases, stable NP dispersions were observed only in the
mid acidic pH ranging from 3.5 to 4.5, which could be due to the formation
of stable ion-pair adduct, which facilitating the formation of AuNPs.

Kinetics of the AuNP Formation
To examine the reaction
completion period, the kinetics of NP formation was monitored at various
time intervals using optimized concentration of DCAmps in below CMC
at mid acidic pH under sunlight exposure (Figure 2). Initially, no characteristic SPR peak
was observed. As the reaction proceeded, a weak and broad absorption
band at around 550–600 nm appeared and shifted gradually to
a constant value of 530 nm with an increased optical intensity. This
could be due to the formation of large fluffy particles that appear
to be composed of smaller clusters. As the time elapsed, the large
agglomerates broke into small-sized particles, giving rise to a gradual
increase in the number density of NPs.34 Soon after, there was no significant change in the intensity of
the SPR band when the exposure time was extended to 90, 180, and 160
min for DCaC-, DCaDC-, and DCaLC-stabilized NPs, respectively, showing
that the reaction was completed. To evaluate the relationship between
the formation of NPs and the reaction time, the plot of the optical
density at 530 nm is presented for these DCAmp–AuCl4– systems (Figure S4). The sigmoid shape of such a kinetic curve suggests that autocatalysis
is involved in the AuNP formation (Figure 2d).35 The apparent
rate constant of the autocatalytic process (ka) was calculated by plotting ln(a/(1 – a)) versus time, where a = ODt/OD∞ and ODt and OD∞ are the optical densities at times t and ∞, respectively. The resulting plots deviating
from the linearity show that the DCAmp–AuCl4– reaction has both noncatalytic and autocatalytic reaction
pathways. From the slopes of these plots, the apparent rate constants
(ka) were found to be 71.0 × 10–3, 28.0 × 10–3, and 35.0 ×
10–3 s–1 for DCaC-, DCaDC-, and
DCaLC-stabilized NPs, respectively.

intervals using a fixed concentration of 1 × 10–3 M of HAuCl4 and 1 × 10–4 M of

× 10–5 M of DCaLC (c) and (d) plot of ln a/(1 – a) vs time using the data
obtained from Figure S4.

Morphological Studies of DCAmp-Templated
AuNPs
The
morphological changes of the template and the size of the AuNPs were
examined by optical microscopy (OPM), field emission scanning electron
microscopy (FE-SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses.
In below CMC, DCaC, DCaDC, and DCaLC exhibited fractal grass (1 ×
10–4 M), microdendrites (2 × 10–4 M), and fern leaf-like fractal patterns (8.3 × 10–5 M), respectively, through diffusion-limited aggregation, as evidenced
from the OPM and SEM images (Figures 3 and S5). After the stabilization
of AuNPs, the morphology of the DCaC changed from fractal grass to
discrete chain-like structures, in which the spherical shaped NPs
were embedded along the chain with an average size of 24 ± 2
nm (Figures 4 and S5). For DCaDC-stabilized AuNPs, the microdendritic
morphology changed to closely associated chainlike structure and the
formed spherical shaped NPs were embedded along the chain aggregates
with an average size of 25 ± 3 nm (Figures 5 and S5). In the
case of DCaLC, the fern leaf-like fractal pattern changed to gel-like
morphology, wherein the spherical shaped NPs embedded over the gel
network and the average size of the NPs was found to be 22 ±
3 nm (Figures 6 and S5). To measure the hydrodynamic radius and charge
of the amphiphile-stabilized AuNPs, dynamic light scattering (DLS)
and zeta potential experiments were performed, as shown in Figure S6, and the obtained results are presented
in Table 2. The difference in the TEM and DLS data is due to the fact
that DLS measurements record higher values because the light scatters
from both the core particle and the layer on the surface of the NPs.
Whereas in TEM measurements, only the metallic particle core is measured.
Further, the value obtained from the zeta potential measurements confirms
the existence of positive charge on the surface of AuNPs. Recently,
we have reported that the charge interactions and hydrophobic and
hydrophilic character of amphiphiles are the driving forces for the
formation of fractal patterns.31 The disturbance
observed in the fractal patterns of these amphiphiles upon the interaction
of AuCl4– ions could be due to the aggregation
or micellization at lower concentrations. Besides, these metal ions
were reduced by the hydrophilicity of the amphiphiles and were subsequently
stabilized by the head-to-head interaction of micelles (Scheme 3), where they follow the chainlike
aggregation process driven by the hydrophobicity of the amphiphiles.

Fluorescence Measurements
of AuNPs
The aggregation
behavior of DCAmp-templated AuNPs was studied by a spectrofluorometer
using pyrene as a fluorescent probe. The intensity ratio of I3/I1 values of pyrene
as a function of the concentrations of DCaC, DCaDC, and DCaLC both
in the absence (curve i) and presence (curve ii) of AuNPs showed a
sigmoid variation (Figure 7). The point of intersection of the horizontal line and the
line of inflation represents the onset of the first and second CMC
of amphiphile-templated AuNPs and pure amphiphiles, and the results
are listed in Table 1. The significant decrease in the CMC of the amphiphile-templated
AuNPs could be related to charge screening,36 where the charge neutralization takes place during the adduct formation
between DCAmps and AuCl4– through electrostatic
interaction, enabling the aggregation or micellization even at lower
concentrations. In recent studies, AuNPs have been used as an efficient
quencher in a wider range of wavelengths for many fluorophores in
the field of biological and chemical sensors.37−39 To study the
protection efficiency of micelle-solubilized pyrene, the quenching
experiment was demonstrated at various concentrations of AuNPs. At
low concentration of AuNPs, the intensity of fluorescence increases
as compared to that of control, indicating that more number of pyrene
molecules were solubilized into the AuCl4–-induced micelles. Upon further increase in the concentration of
AuNPs, the intensity of fluorescence decreases, which could be due
to the quenching of pyrene molecules through energy-transfer process
or alteration of polarity around the pyrene molecules,40 and the obtained data were analyzed using the
following Stern–Volmer equation  where I0 and I are the maximum fluorescence intensity ratio
of pyrene
(I1/I3) in
the absence and presence of a quencher (Q), respectively, KSV is the Stern–Volmer constant (M–1), which provides a direct measure of the quenching
sensitivity, and [Q] is the quencher concentration. The plots of I0/I versus concentration of
NPs show a linearity up to the concentrations of 4.9 × 10–4, 5.0 × 10–4, and 6.1 ×
10–4 M; the KSV values
were found to be 820, 840, and 810 M–1 for DCaC,
DCaDC, and DCaLC, respectively (inset of Figure 8). However, above these concentrations, the
plots were nonlinear with significant upward curvature, suggesting
that the extent of quenching is large (Figure 8). At higher concentrations, micellization
or aggregation becomes more obvious, where the distance between micelle-solubilized
pyrene and AuNPs becomes close enough for energy transfer and/or electron
transfer, leading to high degree of quenching.41

× 10–4 M. The insets show the linear range
in the low-quencher-concentration regime.

Effect of Salt on the AuNP Aggregation
The color change
properties and the stability of colloidal dispersions in the presence
of an electrolyte are very much sensitive to the degree of aggregation
of AuNPs in suspension.21 In biomedical
applications, preventing the aggregation of AuNPs is a very challenging
task. The media in which the cell grows, the cytoplasm of the cell,
and the blood stream are complex aqueous mixtures of nutrients, proteins,
electrolytes, and so forth. Normal saline (0.154 M NaCl) solution
is commonly used as intravenous drips for patients with danger of
developing dehydration or hypervolemia. Hence, it is important to
evaluate the salt tolerance of the as-synthesized AuNPs, wherein they
were treated with various concentrations of NaCl and their stabilities
were monitored by absorption spectroscopy. Upon increase in the concentration
of NaCl to 100, 150, and 120 mM for DCaC-, DCaDC-, and DCaLC-stabilized
AuNPs, respectively, the intensity of the initial band at around 520
nm slightly decreases without any noticeable color changes, suggesting
that these NPs were highly stable up to these concentrations (Figure 9). However, above
these concentrations, the intensity of the SPR band slowly decreased
with a slight red shift. At the same time, a highly intense band developed
between 600 and 700 nm with a gradual shift toward a longer wavelength
region, indicating that the aggregation of AuNPs was accompanied by
a visual color change, as shown in the insets of Figure 9. The stability of the charged
NPs depends on the interaction of the electrostatic repulsive potential
and the van der Waals attractive potential.41 In the presence of high concentration of salt, the positively charged
gold surfaces are electrostatically screened by Cl– ions, thereby decreasing the electrostatic repulsion, favoring the
aggregation of AuNPs, and correspondingly changing the color of the
solution from red to blue. The aggregation of NPs was further confirmed
by TEM analysis, showing that the spherical shaped particles were
closely associated with each other (Figure 9a′–c′). The aggregation
(close association) of colloids generally termed “flocculation”
can be qualitatively distinguished by color changes of the colloids
followed by precipitation. The optimized concentration of NaCl used
for the salt-induced aggregation of NaCl-capped AuNPs reported in
our earlier report was 400 mM.21 Whereas,
in the present study, color change of the DCaC-, DCaDC-, and DCaLC-capped
AuNPs was observed at 420, 460, and 580 mM of NaCl concentrations,
respectively. Thus, the high salt tolerance of these AuNPs could be
used in biological experiments without any further stabilization.
Besides, flocculation parameter (FP) studies can be used to gain semiquantitative
information about the nanostructure stability by measuring the integrated
extinction between 600 and 800 nm (I) in the absorbance spectra at
various concentrations of NaCl (Figure 9). The obtained FPs were plotted as a function of the
concentration of NaCl (Figure 10). The FPs gradually increased as the concentration
of salt increased and attained maximum values of 45.2, 77.9, and 29.8
for DCaC-, DCaDC-, and DCaLC-stabilized AuNPs, respectively. These
findings demonstrate the possibility of regulating the aggregation
rate of the AuNPs in the presence of NaCl. Also, the changes in the
hydrodynamics radius in the presence of NaCl were measured for DCaC-,
DCaDC-, and DCaLC-stabilized AuNPs and were found to be 897, 914,
and 1200 nm, respectively. The results further support the formation
of aggregation of AuNPs.

Conclusions
In
summary, we have demonstrated a facile and single-step approach
of sunlight-mediated thiol–yne click reaction for the preparation
of highly water-soluble cysteamine-conjugated bile acid derived DCAmps.
In below CMC, these amphiphiles exhibit different fractal patterns
such as fractal grass, microdendrites, and fern leaf-like fractals
for DCaC, DCaDC, and DCaLC, respectively. Upon the interaction with
HAuCl4, these fractal patterned amphiphiles change to chainlike
aggregates because of micellization, which was examined by CMC plots
and quenching studies. Although the NPs were formed in all systems
from lower to higher amphiphile concentrations, only the micelles
formed from the fractal pattern concentration produced well-stabilized
AuNPs in which these patterns changed into discrete chainlike structures,
closely associated chainlike structure, and gel-like morphology for
DCaC-, DCaDC-, and DCaLC-stabilized AuNPs, respectively. To gain semiquantitative
information about the nanostructure stability, FPs were calculated
at various concentrations of NaCl and the values were found to be
45.2, 77.9, and 29.8 for DCaC-, DCaDC-, and DCaLC-stabilized AuNPs,
respectively. We believe that the cationic AuNPs with various degrees
of surface hydrophobicity presented in this paper represent fascinating
entities for their entry and subsequent access into living cells in
view of biomedical applications.

aqua regia (HCl/HNO3 3:1, v/v) and then rinsed with double-distilled
water. All solutions for the CMC measurements were prepared using
deionized double-distilled water.

Instrumentation and Methods
1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded
on a Bruker ADVANCE 300 NMR MHZ
spectrometer in DMSO-d6 or CDCl3 solution using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal reference,
and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 75 MHz. The Fourier
transform infrared (FT-IR) measurements were recorded using a PerkinElmer
FT-IR spectrometer. Mass spectra were recorded on Bruker Daltonics
FlexAnalysis.

Synthesis of Propargylated Bile Acid Derivatives
Propargylated
bile acids were prepared by adopting previously reported procedure,27,42 and the NMR and FT-IR results were consistent with the reported
values.

Synthesis of Dicationic Cysteamine-Conjugated Bile Acid
Propargylated bile acid (0.5 g, 0.00116 mol), 5 wt% 2,2′-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone
(DMPA), 5 mL of MeOH, and finally cysteamine hydrochloride (0.26 g,
0.00228 mol) were added into 50 mL three-neck round-bottom flask containing
a magnetic bar. The reaction mixture was purged with N2 for 20 min and then kept under the bright sunlight exposure for
20 min. After completion of reaction, the solvent was concentrated
under reduced pressure and subsequently precipitated in diethyl ether
three times to obtain a waxy solid, which was further subjected under
vacuum to get colored solid compounds (1a, 1b, 1c) with good yield. The compound was stored for further
analysis (see the Supporting Information for NMR details S1–S3).

Sample Preparation
Stock solution of 3 × 10–5 M aqueous pyrene
was prepared by gentle evaporation
of pyrene-solubilized MeOH solution, followed by the addition of an
appropriate volume of double-distilled water in a volumetric flask,
and was sonicated for 1 h. The synthesized hygroscopic dicationic
bile salts were lyophilized and used to prepare exact concentration
of stock solutions. The stock solutions were prepared by adding appropriate
amount of DCaC (0.05 M), DCaDC (0.05 M), and DCaLC (0.005 M) using
double-distilled water, and the subsequent dilutions were made from
this stock solution to get the desired final concentration. Aliquots
of 300 μL of stock solutions of pyrene were added into 4 mL
of various concentrations of DCAmp-templated AuNPs to obtain a final
concentration of 2.25 × 10–6 M of pyrene to
measure the CMC. The solutions were kept for few hours for the encapsulation
of pyrene into the microenvironment of amphiphile-templated AuNPs.
Owing to their self-assembly behavior in aqueous solution, these DCAmps
exhibit strong scattering between 350 and 600 nm, upon excitation
at 336 nm, which was nullified by making a blank subtraction file
(ACI file) for each solution to examine the salt-induced CMC.

Steady-State
Fluorescence Measurements
Fluorescence
measurements of pyrene were recorded using a FluoroMax 4 (Horiba Jobin
Yvon) spectrofluorometer equipped with a Xe-150 W lamp at an excitation
wavelength of 336 nm. The emission spectrum was recorded from 350
to 500 nm at a scan rate of 30 nm/s. The slit widths of excitation
and emission were 20 and 1.5 nm, respectively. A band-pass filter
(10BPF10-340) was used to avoid white light from the monochromators.

Microscopic Studies
The morphologies of self-assembled
amphiphiles before and after the interaction of HAuCl4 were
obtained from SEM (Hitachi S-3000N, Japan) and FESEM (Hitachi High
Tech SU6600), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopic
(HRTEM) images were recorded with a JEOL JEM 2100 microscope equipped
with a Gatan imaging filter. Samples for SEM and FESEM imaging were
prepared by casting 5–10 μL of amphiphile-templated AuNPs
on aluminum foils and then were dried at ambient temperature. The
HRTEM analysis was conducted by placing a drop of the NP solution
on a carbon-coated copper grid and followed by solvent evaporation
under ambient temperature. The average size of the NPs was analyzed
using ImageJ software.

For optical microscopic studies, the
glass slides were initially washed with alcohol and then with double-distilled
water and were dried in a hot air oven. The amphiphile-templated AuNPs
were dropped onto a glass slide using a micropipette and were allowed
for slow evaporation at ambient temperature. The resulting dried drops
were imaged on a Leica DM 2500 optical microscope.

DLS and Zeta
Potential Measurements
The DLS and zeta
potential of amphiphile-stabilized AuNPs were measured in aqueous
medium using the Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS system.
