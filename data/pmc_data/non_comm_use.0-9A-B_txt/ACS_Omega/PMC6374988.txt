To lock atmospheric
CO2 at anthropogenic timescale,
fast weathering silicates can be applied to soil to speed up natural
CO2 sequestration via enhanced weathering. Agricultural
lands offer large area for silicate application, but expected weathering
rates as a function of soil and crop type, and potential impacts on
the crops, are not well known. This study investigated the role of
plants on enhanced weathering of wollastonite (CaSiO3)
in soils. Using rooftop pot experiments with leguminous beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and nonleguminous corn (Zea mays L.), CO2 sequestration was inferred
from total inorganic carbon (TIC) accumulation in the soil and thermogravimetric
analysis, and mineral weathering rate was inferred from alkalinity
of soil porewater. Soil amendment with wollastonite promoted enhanced
plant growth: beans showed a 177% greater dry biomass weight and corn
showed a 59% greater plant height and a 90% greater dry biomass weight.
Wollastonite-amended soil cultivated with beans showed a higher TIC
accumulation of 0.606 ± 0.086%, as compared to that with corn
(0.124 ± 0.053%). This demonstrates that using wollastonite as
a soil amendment, along with legume cultivation, not only buffers
the soil against acidification (due to microbial nitrogen fixation)
but also sequesters carbon dioxide (12.04 kg of CO2/tonne
soil/month, 9 times higher than the soil without wollastonite amendment).

==== Body
1 Introduction
Atmospheric
concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse
gases (GHGs) have increased as a consequence of anthropogenic activities,
resulting in a rise in overall global temperatures and frequency of
extreme weather events.1 There is a global
commitment to reduce GHG emissions, and carbon dioxide capture and
storage (CCS) is seen as an essential strategy for reducing CO2 emissions. Among several approaches to CCS, enhanced weathering
is a chemical storage route whereby CO2 is converted into
CO32–/HCO3– by reaction with alkaline earth metal-oxide-rich minerals.2,3 The most suitable class of naturally occurring Ca- and Mg-containing
minerals for CCS is silicates, owing to abundance, reactivity, and
inertness of principal silicic byproduct ([SiOx(OH)4–2x]n). Even though silicates may not be as reactive as
hydroxide minerals, they dominate the Earth’s crust, which
makes them ideal candidates for weathering studies.4

In this study, the mineral wollastonite (nominally
CaSiO3, but commonly found in association with other minerals,
such as
diopside (CaMgSi2O6)) was the main focus of
investigation, because of its simple chemistry, high dissolution rate,
and the ease of production of carbonated products due to the weaker
bonding of Si to Ca ions.5,6 The world reserves of
wollastonite are estimated to exceed 100 million tonnes with large
reserves in China, Finland, India, Mexico, Spain, Canada, and the
USA.7 For wollastonite, the enhanced weathering
route is explained in eqs 1–3. In the pH range of ∼6.0–9.5,
at an ambient temperature, according to the Bjerrum plot of the carbonate
system, bicarbonate is the dominant species (eq 1). The metal ion (Ca2+) is liberated
from the silicate by the proton (eq 2), and it ultimately reacts with the bicarbonate to
precipitate as calcium carbonate (eq 3).8 Although this is the
conventional description of the carbonation of silicate minerals,
in regularly irrigated agricultural soil (the wollastonite application
focus of this study), CaCO3 may not precipitate (solubility
increases significantly as the pH drops below ∼6–8 at
ambient conditions and is accentuated by the presence of salts) or
may be redissolved into Ca2+ and 2HCO3– by excess carbonic acid (H2CO3). In this case,
rather than remaining in the soil profile, the ions (Ca2+, HCO3–) gradually leach into the groundwater,
and eventually into the oceans, where they are precipitated under
alkaline conditions as calcium carbonates (eq 4)9 CO2 dissolution:
1   calcium release from wollastonite:
2   calcium carbonate precipitation:
3   migration from soil
to ocean:
4  Kinetically, the mineral dissolution reaction
(eq 2) is the weathering
rate-limiting step10 governed by pH, whereas
the carbonate precipitation/dissolution reactions are thermodynamically
controlled. Increased CO2 capture requires higher calcium
ions available for reaction with carbonic acid, and calcium release
from wollastonite depends on the presence of protons. In agricultural
soils, the type of plants and vegetation cover can contribute to enhancing
the mineral weathering rate through several reactions that lead to
soil acidity and consequently faster mineral dissolution. Organic
acids (tartaric, oxalic, maleic, and citric acids) released as root
exudates, microbial decay of plant litter, secretions from mycorrhizal
symbionts (lichen acid, uronic acid, peptides, and amino acids), carbonic
acid formed as a result of CO2 production during root respiration,
and oxidation of soil organic matter microorganisms all lead to soil
acidification.11,12 In this context, leguminous plants
will have an added advantage as they provided more protons via nitrogen
fixation process. During cultivation of leguminous plants, soil is
acidified due to proton release from roots via nitrogen fixation (eq 5).13 The ammonia formed is assimilated to form amino acids and proteins,
which dissociates to form organic anions (such as malate, citrate,
and oxalate) and protons. These protons are transported to the rhizosphere
to maintain a pH of 7 at the cytoplasm.14,15 These acids
help to chelate and solubilize the otherwise normally insoluble elements
such as iron and aluminum;16 hence, leguminous
plants help to increase the soil fertility by fixing atmospheric nitrogen
as well as by solubilizing essential micronutrients. Hence, protons
from root exudates as well as nitrogen fixation can increase the dissolution
of wollastonite to release Ca2+ ions and result in increased
formation of calcium carbonate 5  This reaction is limited at a pH
< 6.7;
however, alkaline silicate mineral addition to agricultural soils
can help in raising the pH,17 as silicate
dissolution consumes protons (eq 2). Since an ideal soil pH for most of the plant is 5.0–6.5,
excessive soil acidification by legumes or excessive alkalinization
via application of mineral rock is undesirable.18 Hence, growing legumes in soil amended with alkaline minerals
can result in a buffer system for optimal plant growth.

Although
wollastonite weathering under laboratory conditions is
well documented,19 no experimental data
are available under crop conditions. The present study was carried
out to determine the potential of wollastonite as a soil amendment
for enhanced weathering, without posing a negative impact on plant
growth. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the role
of plants in enhanced weathering of wollastonite when applied to soils.
Leguminous (beans) and nonleguminous (corn) plants were grown in soil
amended with wollastonite. A hypothesis tested was whether the proton
(H+) released by the beans plant (through eq 5) might stimulate Ca2+ release from wollastonite (eq 2). This study also investigated two effects of wollastonite
application to soils: first, its effect on plant growth and second,
the increase of inorganic carbon in soils amended with wollastonite.
Carbon dioxide sequestration rate and extent were analyzed in terms
of total inorganic carbon (TIC) content of soils, soil alkalinity,
and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of soils.

2 Materials
and Methods
2.1 Wollastonite Characterization
Wollastonite
mineral sourced from Canadian Wollastonite’s Ontario mine was
used for this study. Elemental composition of the wollastonite includes
26% silicon (55% SiO2), 18% calcium (26% CaO), 4.0% magnesium
(9% MgO), 1.8% sulfur, 0.11% nitrogen, 0.10% P2O5, 0.10% K2O, 11 ppm copper, and 1.10 ppm zinc. Assuming
all MgO is present as diopside (CaMgSi2O6),
the estimated diopside content is 27.3 wt %; then, assuming that the
remaining CaO is present as wollastonite (CaSiO3), the
estimated wollastonite content is 39.2 wt %. This estimated mineralogical
composition accounts for nearly two-thirds of the SiO2 content;
thus, the remaining mineral mass is likely composed of free SiO2 and minor silicates and sulfates.

The particle size
distribution of wollastonite was determined by laser diffraction (Malvern
Mastersizer SM), and 90% of particles by volume were less than 25.9
μm in diameter (Figure S1). The loss
on ignition, 0.50 wt % at 900 °C, was determined by thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA); less than half of this loss occurs in the temperature
range for CaCO3 decomposition, indicating negligible CO2 content.

The wollastonite powder was further characterized
by N2 adsorption at 77 K in a physisorption analyzer (Autosorb
iQ). Prior
to adsorption measurement, the wollastonite sample was degassed in
vacuum consecutively at 120 °C (30 min soaking time) and 350
°C (300 min soaking time). The isotherm (Figure S2) obtained showed a narrow H4 hysteresis loop, which
is caused by capillary condensation and is indicative that wollastonite
contains mesopores. The multipoint Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area is 20.28 m2/g, and the average pore
diameter is 33.35 Å, which is characteristic of mesopore presence
(though of relatively low cumulative pore volume given the BET value).
The relatively low specific surface area makes it difficult for wollastonite
to sequester CO2 directly from the gas phase (i.e., the
atmosphere), as diffusion resistance into the mineral particle would
be high, so carbonation kinetics would be very slow. Hence, the aqueous
phase carbonation reaction occurring in the soil via eqs 1–4, which causes mineral dissolution and reprecipitation, is essential
to achieve accelerated weathering.

2.2 Soil
and Plant Selection
The agricultural
soil was collected from a bean field at the intersection of Side Rd
12 and Concession Rd 4, close to the city of Guelph, Ontario (43°28′01.2″N
80°14′19.1″W). The soil was characterized for pH
(4.94), total carbon (TC = 0.868%), total organic carbon (TOC = 0.808%),
and total inorganic carbon (TIC = 0.060%), as described in Section 2.5.

Since
beans and corn were grown in crop rotation on this particular farm,
these plants were selected for this study. Beans (Phaseolus
vulgaris L.) and corn (Zea mays L.) seeds were initially sowed on rockwool, inside a growth tent,
maintained at 24/19 °C, light/dark cycle of 16/8 h, and humidity
at 62%. After seed germination, the seedlings were transplanted into
the soil.

2.3 Mineral Soil Amendment (MSA) and Experimental
Setup
To determine a suitable wollastonite: soil amendment
ratio for growing bean and corn, different amounts of wollastonite
(10–2000 g) were added to a fixed mass of soil (8 kg, suitable
for the size of the pots used). The variation of the pH of these wollastonite-amended
soils was measured with respect to time to determine the amendment
that results in a pH suitable for the growth of plants as well as
for carbon dioxide sequestration (Figure S3). Geochemical modeling, using Visual Minteq v3.1, showed that at
a pH of 7.23, i.e., obtained by mixing 1000 g of wollastonite with
8 kg of soil, the saturation index becomes positive, which is required
for the precipitation of solid mineral phases, especially calcite
in the case of wollastonite. Also, a high mixing ratio of wollastonite
and soil is desirable to ensure that a sufficient amount of carbonate
formation is taking place, so that its detection is possible via the
TIC method (as discussed in Section 2.5).

Experimental pots were set up
at a building rooftop in the University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada.
The six pots set up included original soil (“soil”),
wollastonite-amended soil (“MSA”), beans cultivated
in original soil (“soil + bean”), beans cultivated in
MSA (“MSA + bean”), corn cultivated in original soil
(“soil + corn”), and corn cultivated in MSA (“MSA
+ corn”). Poly(vinyl chloride) pots of 9 L capacity, with a
top diameter of 24 cm, were filled with soil or MSA. For the MSA,
1000 g of wollastonite powder was thoroughly mixed with 8 kg of soil
prior to potting. No other chemical or mineral amendments (e.g., fertilizers)
were used in these experiments. The seedlings, six per pot, were transplanted
on Aug 20, 2017. At the start, all pots were supplied with adequate
tap water, and later, watering spikes were used to maintain adequate
soil moisture. The soil from each pot was sampled, over a period of
8 weeks, using a soil core sampler (1/2″ diameter) at five
different points radially distributed and down to full depth and thoroughly
mixed prior to chemical analyses. The experiment was terminated at
the end of 8 weeks, during the first week of October, after which
the temperature started to fall below 0 °C at night.

2.4 Plant Growth
The plant growth and
development were analyzed based on the development stages. The vegetative
(V1, V2, V3, V4) as well as reproductive stages (R1, R2, R3, R4) were
recorded for beans, and the vegetative stages (V1, V2, V4, V6, V10,
VT) were recorded for corn.20,21 V1 implies the development
of the 1st leaf, V2–V10 = 2nd to the 10th leaf, and VT = appearance
of the tassel (in corn). R1 and R2 imply the beginning of bloom and
full bloom, respectively, whereas R3 and R4 imply the beginning of
pod and full pod, respectively. At the end of the experimental run,
after 55 days, the plants were harvested by cutting them just above
the soil level. The main growth parameters recorded were plant height,
stem width, leaf blade width, and fresh/dry biomass weight. Dry biomass
weight was determined after drying the sample in a drying oven (Thermo
Scientific) at 80 °C for 48 h.22

2.5 Chemical Analyses
The pH of MSA samples
was determined using a suspension made up of various wollastonite–soil
mixtures and 0.01 M CaCl2 solution, at a 1:5 mass ratio,
which was placed on a shaker for 30 min to 72 h. At each measurement,
the suspension was allowed to settle for 1 h before taking the pH
measurement of the clear supernatant.23

Dried soil for other analyses was obtained by placing soil
samples in a muffle furnace (Thermo Scientific F48055-60, Waltham,
MA) maintained at 103 ± 2 °C for at least 15 h, which were
then cooled in a desiccator containing silica gel. Dried samples were
sieved through 200 μm mesh prior to analysis. To determine the
total carbon (TC) in the samples, a Thermo Fisher FlashEA 1112 elemental
analyzer was used. The solid sample is combusted with oxygen gas (99.995%)
and helium (99.999%) in a dynamic flash combustion furnace; the resulting
combustion gases are then passed through a gas chromatograph column,
and a thermal conductivity detector quantifies the CO2 amount
released from the solid sample.

To determine total organic carbon
(TOC), inorganic carbon must
be first removed. For the removal of inorganic carbonates, 30 g of
soil was added to 50 mL of deionized water, and 1 M HCl, enough to
remove the small quantity of TIC present in the sample, was added
to it until the pH dropped below 4. This suspension was filtered using
Whatman paper (45 μm) after 10 min, followed by drying as described
before. The elemental analysis of the acid-treated sample gives the
total organic carbon (TOC) content in the sample. Total inorganic
carbon (TIC) is calculated as the difference between TC and TOC.23

Semiquantitative determination of calcium
carbonate in the sample
can be estimated by using TGA. The dried samples were placed in a
Thermo Scientific Nicolet 700 TGA-FTIR analyzer, where approximately
20 mg was heated from an ambient temperature to 1000 °C in nitrogen
gas atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. Nitrogen gas of
high purity (99.99%) was supplied at a constant flow rate of 100 mL/min
as an inert purge gas. The sample weight (W) as a
function of temperature (T) is recorded and plotted,
and calcium carbonate content is determined based on weight loss above
500 °C.19

Part of the CaCO3 formed by the reaction of CO2 with wollastonite
may dissolve into carbonates (CO32–)
and bicarbonates (HCO3–) in the soil
porewater, according to a system of chemical equilibria.
Hence, to account for this mode of CO2 sequestration as
part of the CCS potential of mineral soil amendment, the alkalinity
of the soil sample was determined by the titration method (Hach method
8221). Total carbonates (based on alkalinity measured in mEq/L and
later converted into mg CaCO3/L) were estimated using eq 6(24) 6  where α1 and α2 are the speciation coefficients for carbonate/bicarbonate
system, which depend on the pH (−log[H+]) of the
soil (eqs 7–9) 7   8   9  The values of Ka1 and Ka2 can be
determined from the pKa value of bicarbonates
(6.35) and carbonates
(10.33). Total carbonate is also expressed in terms of mg Ca2+/L to give a measure of weathering, using the sum of calcium ions
associated with carbonate ([Ca2+]/[CO32–] = 1:1) and bicarbonate ([Ca2+]/[HCO3–] = 1:2) ions. All chemicals used are of Fisher Scientific
analytical grade. The overall schematic of the methodology is depicted
in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Overview of
the methodology used in this study.

2.6 Data Analysis
All of the analysis
readings were taken in triplicates, and mean results reported herein
have been represented along with standard deviations. One-way analysis
of variance with paired t-test comparison was primarily
used to assess treatment differences between plant characteristics
in various trials. P < 0.05 was used as the limit
for statistical significance, unless otherwise stated.

3 Results
3.1 Plant Growth pH–Time
Series
Change in pH in all pots was measured during the experimental
run
to analyze the effect of wollastonite addition (Figure 2a). Addition of wollastonite results in pH
increase. The pH of MSA (7.06 ± 0.04, 15th day) is higher than
that of soil (4.97 ± 0.02, 15th day). The pH of MSA + bean sample,
in the range of 6.57–7.30, is higher than that of soil + bean
(4.90–6.26), whose final value, in turn, is lower than the
pH of soil + corn (6.60). The pH of MSA + bean lagged that of MSA
+ corn until the 38th day, after which the pH of MSA + bean again
dropped. Early-stage pH buffering by the bean could be attributed
to nitrogenase activity in the soil and root surface as nodulation
commences, whereas the late-stage acidification could be attributed
to the numerous fully formed root nodules (Figure 2b).25,26 The rhizobia that symbiotically
work with leguminous crops, such as beans, aid in nitrogen fixation,
which results in soil acidification due to proton release into the
soil. Wollastonite addition balances this soil acidification, through
partial dissolution, which releases alkaline earth elements, but the
pH levels of MSA + bean remain lower throughout than those of MSA
+ corn. On the contrary, pH of MSA + corn is the highest at the end
of the growth period (7.59 ± 0.01), indicating a dominant effect
of the wollastonite alkalinity in regulating pH. Higher pH, however,
does not necessarily indicate the greater extent of mineral weathering.
The hypothesis being tested is that proton release during nitrogen
fixation would facilitate wollastonite weathering and result in more
calcium carbonate formation. This can be determined by measuring total
inorganic carbon (TIC) in the soil samples (Section 3.3).

experiments, with
and without plants, and (b) root nodules formed in MSA + bean sample
(photograph taken on the 42nd day). (*Soil pH reading starts from
the 10th day, which indicates the time when the seedlings were transplanted
to the soil).

3.2 Wollastonite
Impact on Plant Growth
Tracking of the development stages
(Table S1) revealed that the plants performed
identically in wollastonite-amended
soil compared to those in the control (as-received soil) throughout
the 8-week growth period. Differences are seen, however, when looking
at the metrics for individual plant parts (Table 1). At the end of the growth period, corn
grown in MSA had a 59% greater plant height and a 90% greater dry
biomass weight. Similarly, MSA + bean plant sample showed a 177% greater
dry biomass weight compared to the soil + bean sample. Both the plants
showed better growth, in terms of plant height and biomass weight,
in the wollastonite-amended soil (Figure 3). Although the bean plant grew to a similar
height in both the amended and nonamended soils (262.5 ± 5.7
mm, P > 0.05), the leaf blade and stem widths
were
significantly greater in wollastonite amendment. Moisture content
was slightly lower in the plants grown in amended soils, which correlates
with denser plant tissue (i.e., plant size did not increase proportionally
to dry weight). In addition, wollastonite-amended soils showed no
signs of weed growth. These results suggest that wollastonite amendment
does not present negative effects to plant growth (P > 0.05).

3.3 Increased
Soil Carbon Content
Figure 4 shows the soil carbon
contents (TC, TOC, TIC) for all of the experimental pots recorded
at the end of the growth period. MSA + bean soil samples showed the
highest TIC of 0.606 ± 0.086%. In comparison, soil + bean soil
showed a very low TIC accumulation of 0.075 ± 0.001%, which is
similar to the soil (as-received) samples (0.065 ± 0.052%), but
lower than the MSA samples (i.e., soil with wollastonite, but no plants)
that showed a TIC accumulation of 0.221 ± 0.053%. MSA + corn
sample had a TIC of 0.124 ± 0.053% TIC, which is not only lower
than the MSA + bean samples, which might be due to the absence of
protons to facilitate wollastonite dissolution, but also lower than
the MSA samples. This implies that the type of plant, in addition
to the amendment with wollastonite, has a significant impact on TIC
accumulation. TOC contents in all experiments varied within a much
narrower range (0.628–0.864%), with the main discernable trend
being the three lowest values (0.628, 0.699, and 0.701%) seen in the
three pots containing wollastonite.

Figure 4 Soil carbon content (total, organic, and
inorganic) at the end
of the growth period (55 days).

In the context of this study, the challenge seen with TOC
is its
long-term preservation in the soil as a carbon sink, as most organic
compounds that make up TOC are highly unstable and can ultimately
be released back to the atmosphere not only as CO2 but
also as more potent GHGs (measured by the global warming potential
(GWP)) such as methane (GWP100 years = 21), whereas
nitrogen associated with organic matter and microbial activity can
be emitted as even more potent nitrous oxide (GWP100 years = 310).27 On the other hand, TIC is the
stable fraction of the soil carbon content, thus playing the dominant
role in long-term carbon sequestration. Figure 5 shows that the TIC content for all potting
samples increased throughout the growth period. The gradient of TIC
increase (i.e., rate per unit time) for MSA + bean is 4 times greater
than that for MSA.

Figure 5 TIC accumulation over time for all plant growth experiments.
(*TIC
readings were recorded from the 15th day onwards).

At the application rate of wollastonite to soil
used, and according
to wollastonite carbonation stoichiometry, the maximal % TIC value
possible in these tests would be 1.293%. Even though the bottom of
the pots had holes for excess water to escape, during the experimental
run, there was no excess water draining out of the system; hence,
it can be assumed that only evaporation contributed to water removal,
thus allowing easier carbon accounting. To account for the partial
dissociation of formed calcium carbonate and the dissolution of calcium
from wollastonite without subsequent precipitation as carbonate, the
alkalinity of the soil was determined (Figure S4). The TIC results are in consensus with the alkalinity analysis,
which shows the highest alkalinity of 24.0 ± 0.06 mequiv/L for
MSA + bean sample, which is equivalent to 535.2 ± 1.3 mg/L of
total dissolved carbonate (CaCO3) in the soil solution.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) confirms that like alkalinity, there
is the presence of greater quantities of solid-phase carbonates in
the wollastonite-amended samples with plants. The decomposition temperature
range for calcite is approximately 500–800 °C,19 and the TGA graph (Figure S5) shows greater mass losses in this high-temperature range
for wollastonite-amended soil samples (0.23–0.39 wt %) versus
samples not amended (0.06–0.14 wt %). A weight loss of 0.39
wt % for MSA + bean, which corresponds to the thermal liberation of
CO2(g), indicates a CaCO3(s) content of 0.65
wt %, which compares well with the TIC value (Figure 5) determined for the same sample (0.606%).
All of these results support that wollastonite carbonates better with
beans (leguminous species), as the plant type used for cultivation,
rather than corn (nonleguminous species).

4 Discussion
4.1 Importance of pH
The availability
of plant nutrients and the soil’s capacity to absorb and temporarily
retain them are often mediated by the soil pH. Generally, soil pH
in a range of 5–8.5 is acceptable for cultivation. Highly weathered
soil (as used in the present study) is characterized by low calcium
(Ca) and high aluminum (Al) contents, and as a result the root growth
will be impaired, and water and nutrient uptake by the plant will
be affected, hence restricting crop growth.28 It is usually the extremes of acidity (3–4) or alkalinity
(8–10) that cause soil infertility. In acidic soils (as used
in the present study), the ionic forms K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, Mn2+, Fe2+, SO42–, and Cl– predominate,
with complex forms of aluminum (Al) with organic ligands, F and OH.21 Hence, acidic soil pH is characterized with
high levels of Al3+ ions. In agriculture, usually calcium
or magnesium carbonates are needed to increase the pH of an acidic
soil to the desired pH by liming. The indirect liming effect can be
achieved by using wollastonite, which dissolves to form calcium carbonate
during enhanced weathering. By the addition of wollastonite, the results
of this study showed improvement in the pH of the acidic-weathered
soil by supplying exchangeable Ca2+. In a crop application,
this would improve the overall soil nutrient profile. This is evident
from the present results, where beans and corn grown on wollastonite-treated
soil (MSA) showed almost 3-fold better growth as compared to that
grown on untreated soil.

As soil systems are not closed, they
are in a state of dynamic chemical equilibria as the soil is subjected
to liquid inputs/outputs by rainwater, atmospheric condensation and
runoff, and gases entering and leaving the profile. The pH buffering
capacity of the wollastonite-amended soil depends on its capacity
to resist pH change in a dynamic system. Soil organic matter is concentrated
in the top layer of the soil profile, where weakly dissociated organic
acids buffer the soil pH. Below pH 5, pH buffering in many soils is
due to decomposition of clays and other remaining aluminosilicates,
if they are present. For soils with pH in the neutral to moderately
acidic range (5–7), it is usually ion-exchange reactions associated
with clays and organic matter that control pH. Above pH 6.5, the concentrations
of bicarbonate and carbonate anions increase, which is due to the
presence of partly dissolved alkaline and alkaline earth elements;
in the case of wollastonite, calcium carbonate becomes the dominant
pH buffering agent. The pH of MSA + bean sample is in the range of
6.57–7.30, and the pH of MSA + corn at the end of the growth
period is 7.59. This implies that calcium carbonate is the main pH
buffering agent at these pH ranges.

4.2 Role
of Plants in Enhanced Weathering
One of the most important
factors determining soil fertility is pH,
which is also influenced by the type of plant cultivated and is controlled
by the types and amounts of a variety of possible organic and inorganic
root exudates.29 During cultivation of
beans (legumes), the soil is acidified due to proton release from
roots via nitrogen fixation, along with organic anions such as malate,
citrate, and oxalate in the rhizosphere.14,15,30 Phenolics and aldonic acids exuded by the
roots of N2-fixing legumes contribute to a net release
of protons by signaling Rhizobiaceae bacteria to
induce the formation of root nodules, where nitrogen is reduced to
ammonia.29 As for the carbon cycle’s
influence on pH, Nye concluded that the CO2 respired by
roots and associated organisms causes a negligible pH gradient across
the rhizosphere, since the partial pressure of CO2 next
to the plant root is marginally higher than in the adjacent body of
the soil.31 Hinsinger et al. further clarified
why in acidic soils the contribution of root and microbial respiration
to changes in rhizosphere pH can be neglected, by stating that since
H2CO3 remains undissociated at acidic pH values
due to its pK1 of 6.36, CO2 can only significantly affect the pH of neutral to alkaline soils.32 Since the concentration of H+ is
in the order of 10–7 M at near-neutral pH, a change
in pH at this range is accompanied by a very small change in ion concentration.
Hence, the number of moles of organic acids produced in the process
will be very small, in the order of micromoles to millimoles even
after considering partial dissociation;33 so, the effect of the organic anions on TOC and TGA results can
be assumed to be negligible.

The process of proton generation
during the soil nitrogen cycle is soil-induced as well as plant-induced.
Soil-induced process transforms soil N via ammonification, nitrification,
denitrification, and volatilization of ammonia (eqs 10–13). Ammonification
is an enzymatically catalyzed microbial process, which produces ammonium
(NH4+) by deamination of organic N (proteins,
amino polysaccharides, and nucleic acids). Soil acidity is enhanced
due to nitrification of NH4+ to nitrate ions,
which results in the release of protons in the soil. However, denitrification,
microbial reduction of nitrate to gaseous nitrogen (N2),
is a proton consumption step, but soil acidity depends on the magnitude
of nitrification rate and denitrification rate. Most soils have little
ability to retain the nitrate and undergo nitrate leaching, hence
reducing the magnitude of denitrification resulting in soil acidity.
Lastly, ammonia volatilization from ammonium ions is accompanied by
proton generation, thereby reducing the soil pH. The plant-induced
process includes the uptake and assimilation of these ammonium, nitrate,
and nitrogen ions by the roots to form ammonia via deprotonation of
NH4+, reduction of NO3–, and nitrogen fixation of free nitrogen by legumes (Figure 6a). This ammonia is assimilated
to form amino acids, and dissociation of the carboxylic group of the
amino acid results in the generation of H+, which is transported
to the soil to balance the cytoplasm pH (∼7).14 In the case of cultivation of nonlegumes, the nitrogen
formed during denitrification cannot be fixed to ammonia in the absence
of root nodules. ammonification:

13  The plasmalemma H+-pump
is the
principal ion transport regulation mechanism in plant tissues,34 resulting in pH and electrical potential differences
across the cell wall. Although protons are released into the soil,
hydroxyl ions remain in the cytosol, which stimulates the carboxylation
of phosphoenolpyruvate, leading to the production of organic anions
that are released into the soil as root exudates.15 In most plant species, the most representative organic
anion is malate (C2H4O(COO)22–). These protons and root exudates help in the dissolution
of wollastonite, increasing Ca2+ ion release to form CaCO3(s) and Ca(HCO3)2(aq). Figure 6b illustrates the process of
enhanced weathering by legumes. Using wollastonite as a soil amendment
along with legume production not only avoids soil acidification (via
pH buffering) but also sequesters carbon dioxide.

Figure 6 (a) Soil acidification
mechanism (after Bolan et al. (1991)14)
and (b) role of legumes in enhanced weathering.

As seen in Figure 2a, the pH increases until fourth week, which is favorable
for the
precipitation of carbonates,35 but this
precipitation formed on the surface of the wollastonite can passivate
the surface, which might further prevent the reaction of the wollastonite’s
core.36 The low pH, developed as a result
of nitrogen fixation by rhizobia, initially on the root surface and
later within root nodules, can leach out the calcium ions, which will
then precipitate in the soil rather than the surface of the wollastonite.
Soil pH is an important driving force in TIC accumulation, and geochemical
modeling, using The Geochemist’s Workbench (version 12.0),
helped to explain this mechanism.

Figure S6 shows the equilibrium of carbonate
formation with respect to pH, and it was found that calcite precipitation
is favored at a soil pH above 6.5. In this study, soil pH of the wollastonite-amended
soil (MSA) is in the range of 6.57–7.30 for MSA + bean and
6.57–7.59 for MSA + corn, which implies that within this pH
range, calcite precipitation will occur, and this explains the increase
in TIC with time, from the beginning. Also, within this pH range,
wollastonite is prone to dissolution, which is further increased at
lower pH, as evidenced in the wollastonite saturation (Q/K, where Q is the reaction quotient
and K is the equilibrium constant) plot given in Figure S7. This means that as calcium is consumed
in the carbonation reaction, more calcium ions become available from
wollastonite for further sequestering soil CO2, thus leading
to continued increase in TIC, until the end of the experimental run.

Plant cover essentially holds the soil together, as well as its
nutrients. The pH of MSA drops at the end of the experimental run,
which can be probably due to the absence of plant cover in this experimental
setup. In the absence of plants, the soil fertility decreases due
to the washing away of the soil nutrients by rain.37 Additionally, the formed calcium carbonate might react
with the excess carbonic acid (eq 4), and, rather than remaining in the soil profile,
the ions (Ca2+, HCO3–) gradually
leach out of the soil, thus lowering the pH. Hence, plants play an
important role in enhanced weathering to capture atmospheric CO2 as well as to store it.

4.3 Wollastonite
Application to Agricultural Land
Agricultural land offers
a vast area for wollastonite application
for carbon dioxide sequestration. The world’s arable land area
is 13 963 743 km2 (FAO, 2015).38 Taking the wollastonite density of 2.84 g/cm3 and the theoretical CO2 sequestration capacity
of 44 g CO2 per 116.2 g wollastonite (0.379 g/g),39 a total of 40 megatonnes of CO2 could
be potentially sequestered by world’s wollastonite reserve
of at least 100 million tonnes.7 This represents
11.6 kg CO2 per acre if all arable land is treated with
the known reserves of wollastonite. The annual sequestration rate
would be a function of the annual rate of wollastonite application
and weathering rate, and evidently, if more wollastonite was applied
per unit land area, more CO2 could be potentially sequestered.

In this study, wollastonite-treated soil used to grow beans showed
a TIC accumulation of 0.606 ± 0.086% over 8 weeks (equivalent
to 6.06 kg C/tonne soil or 12.04 kg CO2/tonne soil/month),
which compares very favorably to Manning et al.’s data, who
reported that a plot composed of compost and quarry fines showed a
net rate of accumulation as inorganic carbonates for plots that used
carbonate-free crushed rock to be of the order of 0.8 kg C/tonne soil
annualy.40 Theoretically, 2.64 tonne of
wollastonite sequesters 1 tonne of CO2, or 0.273 tonne
of C So 0.125 tonne wollastonite per tonne soil (since 1000 g wollastonite/8
kg soil is used in this study) should sequester a maximum of 47.4
kg CO2/tonne soil or 12.9 kg C/tonne soil. Hence, it will
take 0.33 years for complete carbonation of wollastonite in the soil
amendment used in this study.

Owing to the experimental weather
conditions observed in this study,
limited by the low overnight temperature, the experimental run has
to be cut short to 8 weeks. However, this time length may not be enough
to track the growth cycle of corn (∼90 days); however, it is
enough to track the growth cycle of beans (∼55 days), and for
comparison purpose, the experimental period of 8 weeks for both the
plants seems reasonable. The significance of the result reported in
this study demonstrates that wollastonite application as a soil amendment
has the potential to remove 47.4 kg of CO2/tonne soil/year,
assuming that the crop conditions that resulted in the observed TIC
accumulation over 8 weeks extend for several more weeks to allow full
carbonation to complete within a year. Encouraged by the positive
results of this work, the authors have started field trials on a soybean–corn
field in Summer 2018 to ascertain the amount of CO2 sequestered
annually via wollastonite amendment.

It is difficult to anticipate
all impacts that the input of wollastonite
may have on agricultural systems. Impacts are likely to vary widely
depending on soil, crop, and climate characteristics. Based on Figure 2, it can be expected
that the massive application of wollastonite will induce changes in
soil pH and associated chemistry and this may affect the availability
of plant nutrients. The rate at which natural silicate minerals dissolve
in the soil is one of the fundamental uncertainties in the feasibility
assessment of enhanced weathering.41,42 The release
of potentially toxic elements during the dissolution of minerals may
pose an environmental risk that would limit the application of certain
minerals as a soil amendment for enhanced weathering. Some of these
trace metals (particularly Ni, Mn, Cr, Si) present in the minerals
are micronutrients required by the plants and therefore their presence
is beneficial, as long as their concentration does not reach toxic
levels.43

5 Conclusions
The study was conducted to determine the potential for enhanced
weathering of wollastonite in agricultural soils. Through enhanced
weathering, silicate mineral-derived pedogenic carbonate is generated
to sequester CO2 from the environment. Though the process
happens in the soil, the origin of the CO2 is the atmosphere;
so, the direct removal of CO2 responsible for climate change
is achieved. Enhanced weathering is promoted at a suitable pH range,
a requirement that is shown in the present study to be especially
satisfied when wollastonite is added to soil onto which plants are
cultivated, resulting in an optimally tailored soil pH. Wollastonite
amendment of soils not only showed increased TIC accumulation but
also resulted in a better growth of beans and corns, as indicated
by the biomass dry weight data. The co-benefits of wollastonite soil
amendment (CO2 sequestration and improved crop yield) would
encourage producers to effectively use this mineral to contribute
toward global climate change mitigation without compromising their
produce.
