Here,
we report our trials to regulate the luminescence performance
of the macrocyclic samarium(III) complex and prepare four excellent
luminescent Sm(III) complex-doped poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA)
composites. Four 23-membered [1 + 1] Schiff-base macrocyclic mononuclear
Sm(III) complexes, Sm-2a–Sm-2d, originating from dialdehydes
with different pendant arms and 1,2-bis(2-aminoethoxy)ethane, have
been constructed by the template method. Crystal structures reveal
that every Sm(III) ion with the coordination geometry of a distorted
bicapped square antiprism is capsulated by the macrocyclic cavity
environment forming the “lasso-type” protection. Relative
photophysical properties of macrocyclic Sm(III) complexes are carefully
investigated in solid-state, methanol solution, and doped PMMA film,
and all these show characteristic emissions of the Sm(III) ion associated
with satisfactory lifetimes and quantum yields in all media, which
could be comparable to reported outstanding examples. Especially,
the luminescence performance for this type of Sm(III) complex could
be regulated in the solid state by the use of different functional
groups in the pendant arm while it is not achieved in solution and
the doped PMMA composite. High emitting and air-stable plastic materials
could be obtained when these Sm(III) complexes are doped in PMMA with
0.1 wt % mixing ratio, and the corresponding maximum lifetime and
quantum yield are 61.2 μs and 0.63% in the case of complex Sm-2a, respectively. We believe that
these highly luminescent “lasso-type” Sm(III) complexes
and doped PMMA composites are valuable references in the design of
luminescent lanthanide(III) hybrid materials.

Introduction
As classic optical
function materials, luminescent lanthanide(III)
[Ln(III)] complexes could be used in many fields such as bioimaging,1 solar cells,2,3 fluoroimmunoassay,4−6 telecommunication,7 light-emitting diodes,8,9 sensors,10,11 and so forth. Compared with other
luminescent materials such as nanoparticles and quantum dots, Ln(III)
complexes have characteristic and narrow emissions in the visible
or near infrared region for certain Ln(III) ions because the luminescence
comes from the energy transfer between two specific 4f levels of the
corresponding Ln(III) ion.12−14 In fact, even if they have so
many virtues, Ln(III) complexes still do not show great potential
for practical applications like other candidates. Main reasons for
this issue are ascribed to two aspects. One is the low luminescence
efficiency for most Ln(III) ions in solid state or solution. To date,
only Eu(III) and Tb(III) ions have realized the satisfactory luminescence
performances no matter which environment their complexes are in.15−25 From the “antenna effect” mechanism proposed by Weissman,
we know that the luminescence emissions of Ln(III) ions are closely
related to the energy levels of organic sensitizers.26−29 The high-efficient luminescence of Ln(III) ions usually could be
achieved after the elaborate regulation of triplet levels (T1) by the chromophore selection and group modification.
The other is the adverse architecture of the Ln(III) complex which
is hard to shield Ln(III) ions from various quenchers.30−36 In response to the abovementioned problems, some researchers propose
a solution based on the hybrid materials,37−40 and the luminescent Ln(III) complexes
are proportionally mixed into another substrate, for instance, polymer,41−45 nanometer inorganic material,46−51 and so forth. These works generally could ensure the reliable photophysical
properties and enhance the machining performance of Ln(III) complexes
to prepare four kinds of functional devices.

As a promising
area of luminescent Ln(III) materials, the highly
luminescent Sm(III) complexes as efficient emitters are of great potential
for application in fields such as agricultural films, solar concentrators,
light-emitting devices, anticounterfeiting materials, and so forth.
Herein, we synthesize a family of luminescent macrocyclic Sm(III)
complexes (Scheme 1), explore the regulation of luminescence based on pendant arm modification,
and investigate relative photophysical properties in different media.
By the Sm(III) ion template method,52 we
successfully obtained four 23-membered [1 + 1] flexible Schiff-base
macrocyclic53−55 mononuclear Sm(III) complexes (Sm-2a–Sm-2d), which contain different pendant arms in macrocyclic skeletons.
At the same time, the group modifications are carried out by the use
of different functional groups (electron-withdrawing and electron-donating
groups) in pendant arms. It is found that the functional group of
pendant arms does not play a critical role in changing the electron
distribution of the macrocyclic ligand and photophysical properties
of four Sm(III) complexes are very similar with each other in methanol
solutions. However, their lifetimes and quantum yields are different
in microcrystalline powders and doped poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA)
composites, originating from the different folding patterns of macrocyclic
skeletons and orientations of pendant arms. In particular, these doped
PMMA plastic materials show highly luminescence performances benefitting
from the “lasso-type” protection which could prevent
the fluorescence quenching from the competitive coordination of polymer
molecules.13,56

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis of Dialdehydes, Macrocyclic Mononuclear
Sm(III) Complexes,
and Doped PMMA Plastic Materials
Though pendant arms would
not directly coordinate with central Ln(III) ions, they still could
improve lanthanide(III) luminescence if they were efficient chromophores.12−15 Considering that possible energy transfers in pendant arms could
be further influenced by different functional groups, the adjustment
of the energy level for macrocyclic ligands was operated by the introduction
of different groups in the benzene rings of pendant arms. In this
work, we used trifluoromethyl (−CF3) as the electron-withdrawing
group and methoxyl (−OCH3) as the electron-donating
group relative to chlorine (−Cl) and explored the possible
changes for Sm(III) ion luminescence. In addition, we also tried to
reveal the relationship of the sensitization efficiency and medium,
which was carefully investigated related to several photophysical
parameters of Sm(III) ion luminescence in solid-state, methanol solution,
and doped PMMA plastic materials, in order to evaluate group modifications.

The dialdehyde H2Qa has been reported in
another published work57 while other three
extended dialdehyde precursors (H2Qb, H2Qc, and H2Qd) with different
groups were prepared by following a one-step reaction.58 In fact, two nucleophilic substitutions happened
in this one-step synthesis of dialdehyde between the primary amine
and 5-chloro-3-(chloromethyl)-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. The yields of
H2Qb and H2Qd were higher
than those of H2Qa and H2Qc. It seemed that the electron-withdrawing group in the pendant arm
would lead to higher yields of dialdehydes. Based on the Sm(III) ion
template method, four 23-membered [1 + 1] Schiff-base macrocyclic
mononuclear Sm(III) complexes (Sm-2a [Sm(HL2a)(NO3)2], Sm-2b [Sm(HL2b)(NO3)2], Sm-2c [Sm(HL2c)(NO3)2], and Sm-2d [Sm(HL2d)(NO3)2]) were finally obtained by cyclic condensation reactions between
different pendant-armed dialdehydes and 1,2-bis(2-aminoethoxy)ethane.
By this way, four different groups with different electron effects
were successfully introduced in the macrocyclic ligands (H2L2a, H2L2b, H2L2c, and H2L2d) to regulate the macrocyclic
energy levels. At the same time, methanol was used as the medium when
we studied the luminescence in solution. The common polymer matrix
for luminescent Ln(III) complexes was PMMA, which was a low-cost and
simply prepared polymer with excellent optical and mechanical properties.
Hence, here we have doped these Sm(III) complexes into the PMMA host
to obtain highly luminescent transparent films by the mechanical doping
method during the synthesis of PMMA and the spin-coating method before
the curing treatment.

Spectral Characterization and Crystal Structures
of Macrocyclic
Sm(III) Complexes
In the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectra of four extended dialdehydes, the absorption peaks were found
at 1675–1676 cm–1 (Figures S4–S6), while a series of strong peaks of macrocyclic
Sm(III) complexes could be observed at 1633–1636 cm–1 (Figures S7–S10), indicating the
successful transformation from aldehyde groups (CH=O) to imine
bonds (CH=N) in the resulting products. Interestingly, their
FT-IR spectra were very similar to each other in the fingerprint region.
It was suggested that they had the same molecular structures, that
is, they were polymorphous structures. We also observed a series of
absorption peaks in the range of 1308–1316 cm–1 derived from stretch vibrations of nitrates in four macrocyclic
Sm(III) complexes, which revealed that nitrates coordinated with central
Sm(III) ions. We also monitored targeted macrocyclic Sm(III) complexes
by the electrospray ionization mass spectra (ESI-MS). The existence
of four [1 + 1] macrocyclic mononuclear Sm(III) complexes could be
clearly verified by relative positive peaks (Figures 1 and S11–S13), and these were assigned as the species of solvent cluster ions,
in good agreement with the theoretic simulations. It was critical
that most architectures for four macrocyclic Sm(III) complexes were
still stable without solvolysis in CH3OH because of strong
coordination interactions between the Sm(III) ion and macrocyclic
ligand together with two nitrates. In addition, the single crystals
of three macrocyclic Sm(III) complexes Sm-2a, Sm-2b, and Sm-2c were successfully obtained from
the acetonitrile/ethanol mixture by slow evaporation in air at room
temperature and finally determined by the X-ray diffraction experiments.

respectively] peaks of isotopic distribution corresponding to the
peaks at m/z = 1011.16 and 1039.15.

X-ray single-crystal diffraction results (Table S1) of three macrocyclic Sm(III) complexes Sm-2a–Sm-2c revealed that they belonged to the monoclinic C2/c and triclinic P1̅ space
group, respectively. Their molecular structures with the atom-numbering
scheme are shown in Figures 2 and S14, while the bond distances
and angles for three complexes are given in Table S2. All three Sm(III) complexes had the similar architecture
which was composed of one Sm(III) ion center, one 23-membered [1 +
1] Schiff-base macrocyclic monovalent anion (HL2a–, HL2b–, and HL2c–), and two bidentate nitrate anions. All three macrocyclic skeletons
were outstretched configurations. The dihedral angles between two
salicylaldehyde rings in the macrocyclic skeletons were 69.6(2)–74.7(3)°,
and it was suggested that their macrocyclic skeletons were extremely
similar with each other. The extended dialdehyde components had the
same tripodal configuration while three benzene rings in pendant arms
had different deflection angles. The dihedral angles between the pendant-armed
benzene ring and two salicylaldehyde rings were different. They were
8.7(5) and 82.6(5)° in Sm-2a, 4.4(2) and 73.9(2)° in Sm-2b, and 84.1(2) and 89.9(2)° in Sm-2c. The basal coordination sphere for every Sm(III) ion
was composed of two phenolic oxygen atoms, two nitrogen atoms of imine
bonds, two oxygen atoms of 1,2-bis(2-aminoethoxy)ethane, and four
oxygen atoms of two nitrates at each side of the macrocyclic plane.
The protonated tertiary nitrogen atom N1 was free of coordination
in all the cases. Three 10-coordinate Sm(III) inner coordination spheres
were not with the idealized geometry and could be described as a distorted
bicapped square antiprism.59 Most of all,
we observed the “lasso-type” protection in the three
complexes in which the central Sm(III) ions have been encapsulated
by cyclic cavities of the flexible macrocyclic ligands. As a result,
a beneficial microenvironment was created to shield every Sm(III)
ion from further undesired deactivations. In addition, both of the
two phenolic protons were removed and a proton was added in the tertiary
nitrogen atom N1, which could be verified by the electroneutrality
principle for the whole molecule. This result was consistent with
the fact that all the macrocyclic Sm(III) complexes were synthesized
and obtained in weak acidic conditions (about pH 5.5). It was worth
mentioning that two strong intramolecular N–H···O
hydrogen bonds (Table S3) could be determined
in every complex which should be good for stabilizing the whole complex
architecture. In addition, no additional intermolecular interactions
between neighboring molecules were found after the analysis of the
packing arrangements.

ellipsoids are drawn at the 30% probability level, and the hydroxyl
protons are shown as small spheres of arbitrary radii.

Photophysical Properties of Four Macrocyclic Sm(III) Complexes
in Solid-State, Solution, and Doped PMMA Film
During photophysical
property studies, all the solutions were prepared by dissolving the
corresponding Sm(III) complex in methanol. The solutions were diluted
to a final concentration of 5 μM to ensure the linear relationship
between the intensity of emitted light and the concentration of the
emitting species (A ≤ 0.05). Here, the excitation
wavelengths of all the samples were chosen at 358 nm. UV–vis
spectra of four Schiff-base macrocyclic Sm(III) complexes were first
measured to test regulation results and they showed the same absorption
band centered at 358 nm (Figure S15), which
could be assigned as the characteristic π–π* transition
of the azomethine chromophore in the macrocyclic ligand. It must be
suggested that pendant arms containing diverse functional groups with
different electron effects had no considerable influence on the energy
levels of macrocyclic ligands. This result showed that electron intensities
in azomethine components were not obviously changed because of extremely
weak inductive effects and no conjugative effects of pendant arms
for macrocyclic skeletons. Hence, the dramatical regulation of macrocyclic
energy levels might be successfully achieved only when the modification
of the functional group was operated in the salicylaldehyde part against
the pendant arm.

In this article, only emissions of the Sm(III)
ion in the visible region have been taken into consideration. After
careful luminescence measurements, all the Sm(III) complexes exhibited
four characteristic bands at 563, 596, 643, and 709 nm (Figure 3a,c,e) in the solid-state,
methanol solution, and doped PMMA film, which were responsible for
the transitions from the emitting 4G5/2 to the
corresponding 6HJ (J = 5/2, 7/2, 9/2, and 11/2) states. It was suggested that
all four [1 + 1] Schiff-base macrocyclic ligands (H2L2a–H2L2d) could be served as efficient
sensitizers to induce the characteristic emissions of the Sm(III)
ion. The luminescence intensity of electric dipole transition 4G5/2 → 6H9/2 at 643
nm was a little higher than that of magnetic dipole transition 4G5/2 → 6H7/2 at 596
nm in all three states, and resulting magenta luminescence could be
observed by naked eyes. In four complexes, the intensity ratios between
two transitions, I(4G5/2 → 6H9/2)/I(4G5/2 → 6H7/2), were roughly identical (about
1.30) in methanol solution. This indicated that the local environment
around the Sm(III) ion in methanol remained the same for them. At
the same time, it was complicated in solid-state and doped PMMA film.
Overall, compared with the amorphous complex Sm-2d, all three complexes Sm-2a–Sm-2c in
the microcrystalline form had higher emission intensities related
to the crystal field effect, which could split the energy levels of
the Sm(III) ion resulting in the increasing numbers of energy levels,
probabilities of nonradiative energy transfer, and energy transfer
efficiencies.

and (e) doped PMMA films (0.1 wt %) at room temperature upon λex = 358 nm. Lifetimes for Sm(III) complexes in (b) solid-state,
(d) methanol solution ([M] = 5 μM), and (f) doped PMMA films
(0.1 wt %) at room temperature upon λem = 643 nm.

Quantum yields (Φ) and lifetimes (τ)
of complexes Sm-2a–Sm-2d were also carefully measured
and calculated
in order to further evaluate sensitization results and local environments
of central Sm(III) ions. Quantum yields for complexes Sm-2a–Sm-2d have been determined at 298 K and are listed in Table 1. The lifetimes have been investigated
by detecting the visible transition 4G5/2 → 6H9/2 at 643 nm for all the samples at room temperature.
Calculated values of lifetimes are given in Table 1. Overall, all four macrocyclic Sm(III) complexes
showed high quantum yields and lifetimes in the solid state which
were comparable to other reported Sm(III) complexes.16,60−64 Especially, the corresponding quantum yield and lifetime of complex Sm-2a were 4.66% and 96.3 μs,
respectively, which were the biggest values among the four complexes.
Though significant changes of macrocyclic sensitizer levels were not
successful by modifications of different functional groups in pendant
arms, the different folding patterns of macrocyclic skeleton and orientations
of pendant arms were realized in their single crystals which could
affect relative energy transfer efficiencies by the crystal field
effect. In addition, the architecture of complex Sm-2a in microcrystalline powder should have
more efficient energy transfers.

used for lifetime and quantum yield determinations.

b The samples of complexes Sm-2a–Sm-2c were microcrystalline powders and complex Sm-2d was amorphous powder.

c Quantum yields were determined by
the use of an integrating sphere at room temperature.

As shown in Figure 3c, in the four complexes, we observed the
symmetrical shapes and
absence of splitting for the peak at 598 nm, derived from the 4G5/2 → 6H7/2 transition
of the Sm(III) ion, which should be because of solvent temperature
fluctuations. All the luminescence decay curves (Figure 3d) for four complexes in methanol
have been fitted with monoexponential functions which also suggested
the presence of one major luminescent species in every solution. Interestingly,
for the four complexes, their lifetimes (37.7–39.2 μs)
were very similar with each other in methanol. It was suggested that
they had the similar energy-transfer process, and the modification
of the functional group in the pendant arm did not obviously change
the degree of the solvation effect for each Sm(III) complex. For the
four complexes, quenching effects, originating from methanol molecules,
were remarkably strengthened compared with the solid state which could
be proven by the obvious reduction of lifetimes and quantum yields.
Their similar quantum yields, determined to be 0.42–0.46%,
proved these points again.

In order to improve the machinability
of the luminescent Sm(III)
complex for practical applications, we also selected PMMA as the substrate
to prepare excellent composites, which possessed the luminescence
properties of the Sm(III) ion together with the properties of PMMA
matrices, for instance, low-weight, transparency in the visible range,
and good mechanical properties. The abovementioned four complexes
have been doped into PMMA matrices, and films (about 10 μm thick)
of each Sm(III) complex doped (0.1 wt %) in PMMA were deposited on
glass substrates. As expected, four characteristic emission bonds
could also be observed for each film doped with the corresponding
Sm(III) complex (Figure 3e), revealing the structural stability for every complex in PMMA.
The decay curves (Figure 3f) for four complexes in PMMA were also fitted with monoexponential
functions indicating one luminescent species in each composite. As
listed in Table 1,
their lifetimes were also similar with each other that suggested the
similar local environments of Sm(III) complexes surrounded by PMMA
polymer molecules just like methanol molecules in solution. Compared
to the solid state, the insertion of four Sm(III) complexes into PMMA
matrices led to two results: the lifetimes reached at the same values
shortened by about 29, 4, 1, and 24%, respectively, and their quantum
yields tended to be the same as well. The abovementioned results revealed
that the crystal field effect had little impact on the energy transfer
of sensitization when macrocyclic Sm(III) complexes were mixed into
methanol or PMMA under the low concentration. Simultaneously, it was
indicated that the coordination sphere of the central Sm(III) ion
could not be fully shielded by the macrocyclic cavity microenvironment
in this “lasso-type” architecture. For all four complexes,
the existence of additional interactions was probable between the
methanol molecules and Sm(III) complexes in solution compared with
the solid state. Finally, the same photophysical results were obtained
after half a year (Figure S16) in air without
phase separation suggesting the satisfactory stability of these doped
PMMA films of the four Sm(III) complexes. The doped PMMA films would
split, and obvious phase separation phenomenon could be observed at
the same time if the doped content of the Sm(III) complex was more
than about 2 wt %.

Conclusions
In summary, we have
demonstrated that a series of [1 + 1] pendant-armed
Schiff-base macrocyclic mononuclear Sm(III) complexes (Sm-2a–Sm-2d) are synthesized by the Sm(III) ion template. X-ray structures
confirm that each ten-coordinate Sm(III) center with the coordination
geometry of a distorted bicapped square antiprism is fully capsulated
by the cavity environment of the corresponding macrocyclic ligand
to form “lasso-type” architecture. Moreover, all four
macrocyclic ligands (H2L2a–H2L2d) could serve as effective sensitizers for the Sm(III)
ion, exhibiting characteristic emissions. It simultaneously proves
that the luminescence performance of the macrocyclic Sm(III) complex
in the solid state could be efficaciously regulated by different functional
groups in pendant arms without the same results in methanol solution.
These macrocyclic Sm(III) complexes are also used as molecular emitter
materials to prepare four highly luminescent doped PMMA films with
0.1 wt % contents. The average quantum yield of four polymeric materials
is 0.58%, and the maximal value is as high as 0.63%. It is also found
that these doped PMMA composites are air-stable for at least half
a year. These properties are at the top rank of reported emissive
Sm(III) polymeric materials with a Sm(III) complex doped in the PMMA
matrixes. Further work is being undertaken on this luminescent “lasso-type”
Sm(III) complex to continuously improve its luminescence performances
and application potentials.

Materials and Methods
Unless otherwise specified, reagents
of analytical grade were purchased directly from commercial sources
and used without any further purification.

1H NMR
spectroscopic measurements were performed on a Bruker DPX 300 MHz
spectrometer in CDCl3, using tetramethylsilane (SiMe4) as an internal reference at room temperature. Elemental
analyses were measured using a PerkinElmer 1400C analyzer. ESI-MS

Syntheis of Sm-2a ([Sm(HL2a)(NO3)2])
The macrocyclic Sm(III)
complex Sm-2a was prepared following
our previously reported procedure.57 Sm(NO3)3·6H2O (0.045 g, 0.10 mmol) was
dissolved in ethanol (20 mL) and added to a solution of H2Qa (0.048 g, 0.10 mmol) in acetonitrile (10 mL). The mixture
was refluxed for 10 min, and then ethanol solution (20 mL) of 1,2-bis(2-aminoethoxy)ethane
(0.017 g, 0.11 mmol) was added. The yellow green solution was refluxed
for additional 2 h, cooled to room temperature, and filtered. The
filtrate was concentrated to give complex Sm-2a in a yield of 76% (0.067 g). Anal. Calcd for C30H31Cl3N5O10Sm:

1313 (s), 1075 (w), 769 (w). Yellow green single crystals of complex Sm-2a in a rectangular shape were
grown from a mixture of ethanol/acetonitrile (v/v = 4:1) by slow evaporation
in air at room temperature for 2 weeks.

Synthesis of Sm-2b ([Sm(HL2b)(NO3)2])

of Sm-2c was the same as that
of Sm-2a except that H2Qc (0.051 g, 0.10 mmol) was used. Yield: 69%, (0.062 g).
Anal. Calcd for C32H36Cl2N5O12Sm: C, 42.52; H, 4.01; N, 7.75%. Found: C, 42.43; H,
3.95; N, 7.70%. ESI-MS (positive mode, m/z): 1037.21 {[Sm(HL2c)(NO3)2] + 6H2O + Na}+ (100%) and 1065.15 {[Sm(HL2c)(NO3)2] + 2CH3OH + 4H2O + Na}+ (96%). Main FT-IR absorptions (KBr pellets,

The synthetic process
of Sm-2d was the same as that
of Sm-2a except that H2Qd (0.052 g, 0.10 mmol) was used. Yield: 80%, (0.073 g).
Anal. Calcd for C30H30Cl4N5O10Sm: C, 39.48; H, 3.31; N, 7.67%. Found: C, 39.38; H,
3.23; N, 7.60%. ESI-MS (positive mode, m/z): 1045.14 {[Sm(HL2d)(NO3)2] + 6H2O + Na}+ (29%) and 1071.24 {[Sm(HL2d)(NO3)2] + 2CH3OH + 4H2O + Na}+ (30%). Main FT-IR absorptions (KBr pellets,

1459 (s), 1310 (s), 1075 (s), 768 (m).

All the films (about
10 μm thick) of Sm(III) complexes doped (0.1 wt %) in PMMA were
obtained by the same procedure: 9.5 mg Sm(III) complexes and 0.050
g azobisisobutyronitrile were directly added into 10 mL of methylmethacrylate
under mechanical stirring, and the mixture was treated under ultrasound
for 30 min. The prepolymerization reaction was carried out at 55 °C
for 2 h under magnetical stirring, and then the viscous mixture was
kept at 55 °C without stirring for another 2 h. The films of
Sm(III) complexes doped in PMMA were deposited on glass substrates
by the spin coater together with a one-night drying treatment at 45
°C.
