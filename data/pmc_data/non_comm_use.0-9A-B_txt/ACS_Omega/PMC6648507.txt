The object of this work is to prepare
quinoxaline-based benzoxazines
and evaluate thermal properties of their thermosets. For this object,
4,4′-(quinoxaline-2,3-diyl)diphenol (QDP)/furfurylamine-based
benzoxazine (QDP-fu) and 4,4′,4″,4‴-([6,6′-biquinoxaline]-2,2′,3,3′-tetrayl)tetraphenol
(BQTP)/furfurylamine-based benzoxazine (BQTP-fu) were prepared. The
structures of QDP-fu and BQTP-fu were successfully confirmed by FTIR
and 1H and 13C NMR spectra. We studied the curing
behavior of QDP-fu and BQTP-fu and thermal properties of their thermosets.
According to DSC thermograms, QDP-fu and BQTP-fu have the attractive
onset exothermic temperatures of 181 and 186 °C, respectively.
The onset temperature is approximately 45 °C lower than that
of a bisphenol A/furfurylamine-based benzoxazines. According to DMA
TMA and TGA thermograms, the thermoset of BQTP-fu shows impressive
thermal properties, with a Tg value of
418 °C, a coefficient of thermal expansion of 39 ppm/°C,
a 5% decomposition temperature of 430 °C, and a char yield of
72%.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Quinoxaline, a complex
ring of benzene and pyrazine, is generally
formed by the condensation of an ortho-diamine with
a dialdehyde,1 ethanol,2 1,4-dioxane-2,3-diol,3 and so
on. Polyquinoxalines, prepared by the reaction of a bis(o-diamine) with a bisglyoxal4 or a bisbenzil,5 are a class of high-performance polymers with
many attractive properties, including excellent hydrolytic, thermal,
and mechanical properties. In addition, quinoxaline derivatives have
shown antibacterial, antiviral, herbicidal, anti-inflammatory, and
antitumor properties.6−13

Benzoxazine are heterocyclic compounds and will proceed ring-opening
polymerization (ROP) during thermal treatment.14−20 Benzoxazine thermosets have unique properties such as moderate-to-high
thermal properties and dimensional stability, and low surface free
energy.21,22 The properties of benzoxazine thermosets
are strongly influenced by the structures of their precursors. Because
polyquinoxalines are a class of high-performance polymers, benzoxazines
with quinoxaline as a core might result in high performance. However,
to the best of our knowledge, the literature on quinoxaline-containing
1,3-benzoxazines is rare and limited to three patents.23−25 Wang et al. prepared benzoxazines from a quinoxaline-containing
aminophenol (Scheme 1a),23 aminophenol (Scheme 1b),24 and triamine
(Scheme 1c).25 The benzoxazine thermosets show Tg values as high as 195, 213, and 372 °C, respectively.
Generally, it is difficult to prepare a benzoxazine monomer from an
aminophenol because it is an A–B type reactant, and will lead
to oligomeric benzoxazines.26 In addition,
it is difficult to prepare a benzoxazine monomer from triamine because
the reaction of triamine with formaldehyde led to a triazine network
and resulted in gelation.27 To avoid these
problems, the authors use a three-step procedure to prepare the desired
benzoxazine monomers.28 Although high-purity
benzoxazines can be prepared through that approach, multiple steps
(at least four) are required to prepare the aforementioned quinoxaline-containing
1,3-benzoxazines.

Furfurylamine is typically
formed by the amination of furfural,
which is a product of acid-catalyzed dehydration of 5-carbon sugars,29 and is one of the oldest renewable chemicals.30 Furfurylamine-containing benzoxazines received
much attention because of their low cost and high performance. For
example, Liu et al. prepared a bisphenol A/furfurylamine-based benzoxazine
and found that the reaction between furan and oxazine increased the
thermal stability.31 Verge et al. prepared
benzoxazines from phloretic acid-derived biphenols and furfurylamine.32 The work highlighted the suitability of phloretic
acid to act as a green and efficient alternative to phenol. Endo et
al. prepared guaiacol/furfurylamine-based benzoxazine, they reported
that the furan moiety participates in the ROP of benzoxazines via
electrophilic aromatic substitution.33 Varma
et al. prepared a vanillin/furfurylamine-based benzoxazine.34 A curing mechanism of furan electrophilic substitution
and decarboxylation was proposed. Dumas et al. prepared resorcinol/furfurylamine-based
and hydroquinone/furfurylamine-based benzoxazines by a solventless
method. The thermosets exhibit excellent thermomechanical properties
with glass transition temperatures higher than 280 °C and present
remarkable inherent charring ability upon pyrolysis.35 Dumas et al. also prepared a water-soluble arbutin/furfurylamine-based
benzoxazine in a solventless method. Thermoset with a Tg of 190 °C and good adhesion on various substrates
was achieved.36 Liu et al. prepared a daidzein/furfulylamine-based
bio-benzoxazine through a microwave-assisted synthesis in PEG 400.37 According to the literature, a thermoset with
a Tg of 391 °C dynamic mechanical
analysis (DMA data), the highest Tg value
that has ever reported at that time, was achieved.

In this work,
we report the facile synthesis two quinoxaline-containing
benzoxazines. The first one is a difunctional benzoxazine (QDP-fu),
prepared from the Mannich condensation of furfurylamine, formaldehyde,
and 4,4′-(quinoxaline-2,3-diyl)diphenol (QDP). The second one
is a tetrafunctional benzoxazine (BQTP-fu) from the Mannich condensation
of furfurylamine, formaldehyde, and 4,4′,4″,4‴-([6,6′-biquinoxaline]-2,2′,3,3′-tetrayl)tetraphenol
(BQTP). We studied the curing behavior of QDP-fu and BQTP-fu and thermal
properties of their thermosets. Detailed synthesis and characterization
of QDP-fu and BQTP-fu and the properties of their thermosets were
analyzed in this work.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Characterization of QDP and
BQTP
The biphenol (QDP) was prepared from the condensation
of 4,4-dihydroxybenzil with o-phenylenediamine. The
tetraphenol (BQTP) was prepared from the condensation of 4,4-dihydroxybenzil
with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Scheme 2). Figure 1 shows the 1H–13C HETCOR
NMR spectra of (a) QDP and (b) BQTP. The correlation in Figure 1 supports the structure of
QDP and BQTP.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of (a) QDP and QDP-fu (b) BQTP and BQTP-fu
Synthesis and Characterization
of QDP-fu and BQTP-fu
According to the literature,38 benzoxazine
synthesis is proceeded by two steps: the formation of triazine and
the dissociation of the resulting triazine. In our previous work,39 we found that the solvents influence the reaction
rate of the two steps, and the co-solvent of toluene/ethanol works
best for the synthesis of benzoxazine. QDP-fu was synthesized from
the Mannich condensation of furfurylamine, formaldehyde, and QDP (Scheme 2). Table 1 (Runs 1–6) lists the
effect of reaction conditions on the preparation of QDP-fu. Reacting
in 1,4-dioxane (Run 1), a common solvent for Mannich condensation,
at 80 °C for 12 h led to low conversion and low yield. Reacting
in dioxane/ethanol at 85–95 °C (Runs 2–4) and toluene/ethanol
at 80 °C (Runs 5), a recommended medium for Mannich condensation
in our previous work,39 also led to an
incomplete reaction with low yield. We think that the conjugation
of phenol with quinoxaline reduced the reactivity (Scheme 3). Therefore, a solvent with
a higher boiling point was considered. Xylene was chosen to replace
toluene, and 1-pentanol was chosen to replace ethanol. Reacting in
xylene/1-pentanol at 120 °C (Run 6), as expected, led to a complete
reaction and an 85% yield. BQTP-fu can also be successfully synthesized
in xylene/pentanol at 120 °C from the Mannich condensation of
furfurylamine, formaldehyde, and BQTP (Scheme 2). Because of the resonance of phenol and
C=N of quinoxaline that will reduce the electron density of
the phenol group in QDP and BQTP, the preparation of QDP-fu and BQTP-fu
is not as easy as a bisphenol A/furfurylamine-based benzoxazine. Therefore,
the high-boiling co-solvent of xylene/1-pentanol that can provide
high reaction temperature at 120 °C, works the best.

Figure 2 shows the 1H NMR spectrum of QDP and QDP-fu. For the
QDP-fu, no phenolic
hydroxyl at 9.8 ppm was observed, indicating the completion of the
reaction. The characteristic peaks at 7.6, 6.4, and 6.2 ppm (H15–H17 for furan), 4.89 and 3.87 ppm (H12 and H11 for oxazine)
confirm the structure of QDP-fu. Figure 3 shows the 13C NMR spectrum QDP-fu.
The characteristic peaks at 152.4, 142.7, 110.4, and 108.7 ppm (C14–C17 for furan), 81.2 and 48.5 ppm (C12 and C11 for oxazine) confirm the structure of
QDP-fu. Figure 4 shows
the enlarged (a) 1H–1H COSY and (b) 1H–13C HETCOR NMR spectra of QDP-fu. The
correlation of NMR signals is consistent with the structure of QDP-fu.

BQTP-fu. Figure 6 shows
the 13C NMR spectrum of BQTP-fu. The characteristic peaks
at 152.4, 142.7, 110.4, and 108.7 ppm (C18–C21 for furan), 82.0 and 48.5 ppm (C16 and C15 for oxazine) confirm the structure. Figure 7 shows the enlarged (a) 1H–1H COSY and (b) 1H–13C HETCOR

2.2 DSC Thermograms
Figure 8 displays the differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms of QDP-fu and BQTP-fu. QDP-fu
and BQTP-fu, respectively, show a melting point at 65 and 102 °C,
and an onset exothermic temperature approximately at 202 and 204 °C
and an enthalpy of 359 and 172 kJ/mol, respectively. The onset exothermic
temperature is approximately 25 °C lower than that of bisphenol
A/furfurylamine-based benzoxazine (BA-fu).31 We prepared the 4,4′-bisphenol F/furfuylamine-based benzoxazine
(BF-fu) for comparison of the DSC thermogram (Figure 8). The onset exothermic temperature is approximately
18 °C higher than that of QDP-fu. We speculate that the lone
pair of nitrogen of quinoxaline might plays a role in catalyzing the
ring opening of oxazine. It probably explains the lower onset exothermic
temperatures of QDP-fu and BQTP-fu than those of BA-fu and BF-fu.
However, a detailed analysis is required to confirm for the speculation.
The exothermic peaks of QDP-fu and BQTP-fu are different from general
benzoxazines. They are not symmetrical and seem to be the combination
of two exothermic peaks. The same result was also observed for BF-fu.
From IR analysis (Figure 10, to be discussed later), we found sequential curing reactions
for QDP-fu and BQTP-fu. The sequential curing reactions probably explain
the two exothermic peaks of QDP-fu, BQTP-fu, and BF-fu.

2.3 Rheology Curves
Figure 9 shows the isothermal rheology
curves of QDP-fu and BQTP-fu at 180 °C. The gelation time was
determined by the moduli cross-over point in the isothermal, isochronic
curves. QDP-fu has a gelation time of 25.1 min, while BQTP-fu, because
of its tetrafunctional characteristic, has a shorter gelation time
of 11.1 min.

Figure 9 Isothermal rheology curves of QDP-fu and BQTP-fu at 180
°C.

2.4 IR Analysis
Referring to the curing
chemistry of furan and benzoxazine,33,40 three reaction
routes for the curing of QDP-fu are shown in Scheme 4. The first route is the ring opening of
benzoxazine, forming an intermediate with zwitterions of oxazine.
The second route is the reaction of furan and the zwitterion of oxazine,
leading to structure 2. The third route is the reaction of free ortho
and zwitterion of oxazine, leading to structure 3. FTIR was used to
monitor the curing reactions. Figure 10a shows the IR
spectra of QDP-fu after thermal treatment for 20 min at each temperature.
As curing progressed, the absorption at 930 cm–1 (C–H out-of-plane bending absorption of oxazine) decreased
remarkably. The signal of the trisubstituted benzene ring31,41,42 at 1501 cm–1 decreased gradually with the curing temperature. This result confirms
the curing of oxazine during the heating process. The signal of furan40 at 985 cm–1 decreased gradually
and disappeared after curing at 200 °C. The decrease of the signals
of furan and the trisubstituted benzene ring at the early stages of
curing supports the reaction routes 1–2 shown in Scheme 4.The signal of the tetrasubstituted
benzene ring31,33,40 at 1477 cm–1, which resulted from structure 3
shown in Scheme 4,
increased gradually after curing at 200 °C. Therefore, the IR
results indicate that routes 1,2 occurred at a lower temperature (before
180 °C), and route 2 occurred at a higher temperature (after
200 °C). Figure 10b shows the IR spectra of BQTP-fu after thermal treatment for 20
min at each temperature. The analytic result of BQTP-fu is the same
as that of QDP-fu. We think that the sequence reactions are responsible
for the two exothermic peaks of QDP-fu and BQTP-fu in the DSC thermograms
of QDP-fu and BQTP-fu (Figure 8).

process.

Scheme 4 Curing Chemistry for QDP-fu
2.5 Thermal
Properties
Figure 11 shows the thermal mechanical
analysis (TMA) thermograms of QDP and BQTP after curing at 220 or
240 °C. The thermosets are named C-QDP-fu-X and C-BQTP-fu-X, in which X is the final curing temperature.
The TMA result is listed in Table 2. Curing at 240 °C lead to thermosets with a higher Tg than curing at 220 °C. For example, C-QDP-fu-240
and C-BQTP-fu-240 have a Tg value of 268
and 295 °C, respectively, which are about 30 °C higher than
those of C-QDP-fu-220 and C-BQTP-fu-220. Therefore, the final curing
temperature of all samples is set to 240 °C, and the sample ID
is named C-QDP-fu and C-BQTP-fu (we delete the “–240”
for simplicity). TMA data show that thermoset based on tetrafunctional
BQTP-fu has a higher Tg value and lower
coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) than that based on difunctional
QDP-fu. For example, the Tg and CTE value
of C-BQTP-fu are 298 °C and 39 ppm/°C, which are better
than those of C-QDP-fu (268 °C and 58 ppm/°C), demonstrating
the advantage of tetrafunctional characteristic.

and C-BQTP-fu-X.

Figure 12 shows
the DMA thermograms of C-QDP-fu and C-BQTP-fu. C-BQTP-fu, derived
from tetrafuctional BQTP-fu, shows higher modulus (4.0 GPa) than the
C-QDP-fu do (1.3 GPa). The Tg taken from
the peak temperatures of tan δ are 329 and 419 °C, respectively.
The value of 329 °C is similar to the Tg value of thermoset of difunctional bisphenol A/furfurylamine-based
benzoxazine.31 However, the Tg value of 419 °C, to the best of our knowledge,
is an ultra-high value for a benzoxazine thermoset. The tetrafunctional
characteristic and the furan moiety that increase the cross-linking
density explain the very high Tg characteristic.

Figure 12 DMA
thermograms of C-QDP-fu and C-BQTP-fu.

Figure 13 and Table 2 show
the thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) data of C-QDP-fu and C-BQTP-fu. The 5% decomposition
temperatures for C-QDP-fu and C-BQTP-fu are 410 and 430 °C, respectively.
C-BQTP-fu shows a slightly higher decomposition temperature than C-QDP-fu,
probably because of the higher functionality in the precursor. The
char yield is as high as 72% for both C-QDP-fu and C-BQTP-fu. Generally,
the thermoset of bisphenol-based benzoxazines such as bisphenol F/aniline-based,
and bisphenol A/aniline-based benzoxazine exhibit a 5 wt % decomposition
temperature at around 300–350 °C.43,44 The result demonstrates the high thermal stability characteristic
of C-QDP-fu and C-BQTP-fu.

3 Conclusions
We have successfully prepared a quinoxaline-containing diphenol
(QDP) and tetraphenol (BQTP). Based on QDP and BQTP, we have successfully
prepared two benzoxazines (QDP-fu and BQTP-fu) from the Mannich condensation
of furfurylamine, formaldehyde, with QDP and BQTP, respectively, in
a co-solvent of xylene/pentanol (2/1, v/v) at 120 °C. 1H and 13C, 1H–1H, and 1H–13C NMR spectra have successfully confirmed
their structures. Through IR analysis, we found that the curing reactions
include a sequential curing procedure. The ring opening of oxazine
and the reaction of furan with zwitterion of oxazine take place at
the early stage of curing, and the reaction of free ortho with zwitterion
of oxazine take place later. Thermal analysis shows that the thermosets
(C-QDP-fu and C-BQTP-fu) exhibit very high thermal properties. Especially,
C-BQTP-fu showed impressive thermal properties, with a Tg value of 418 °C, a CTE of 39 ppm/°C, a 5%
decomposition temperature of 430 °C, and a char yield of 72%.
To the best of our knowledge, these properties are competitive to
other polybenzoxazines.

152.4 (C14), and 154.3 (C8). A melting peak at 65 °C, and an
exothermic peak at 235 °C with an enthalpy of 309 J/g (359 kJ/mol)
were observed in the DSC thermogram.

4.7 Synthesis
of BQTP/Furfurylamine-Based Benzoxazine
(BQTP-fu)
BQTP 0.695 g (2.21 mmol), paraformaldehyde 0.266
g (8.84 mmol), furfurylamine 0.43 g (4.42 mmol), and xylene/1-pantanol
(2/1) 9 mL were introduced into a 100 mL round-bottom glass flask
equipped with a condenser and a magnetic stirrer. The mixture was
stirred at 130 °C for 24 h. After that, the solution was poured
into hexane to precipitate. The precipitate was dissolved in dichloromethane
and extracted with 1.0 N NaOH(aq) twice, and water twice. The organic
phase was evaporated to afford yellow powder with a yield of 76%. 1H NMR (ppm, DMSO-d6): δ
= 3.82 (16H, H17,15) 4.87 (8H, H16), 6.26 (4H, H21), 6.40 (4H, H20),
6.70 (4H, H7), 7.16 (4H, H6,10), 7.60 (4H, H19), 8.06 (2H, H2), 8.20
(2H, H1), 8.40 (2H, H13). 13C NMR (ppm, DMSO-d6): δ = 47.4 (C17), 48.5 (C15), 82.0 (C16), 108.7 (C21), 110.4 (C20), 115.5 (C7), 119.4 (C9), 126.3 (C13), 128.9 (C6,2,1,10), 130.8 (C14), 139.9 (C4,3,11), 142.7 (C19), 151.5 (C5), 152.4
(C18), 152.8 (C12), and 154.4 (C8). A melting peak at 102 °C, and an exothermic peak at 225 °C
with an enthalpy of 223 J/g (172 kJ/mol) were observed in the DSC
thermogram.

4.8 Sample Preparation and
Curing Procedure
QDP-fu and BQTP-fu were dissolved in DMAc
to make a solution with
a solid content of 20 wt %. The solution was cast in an aluminum mold,
and dried in an oven at 80 °C for 12 h to remove most of the
solvent, and then cured at 140, 200, and 240 °C (2 h for each
temperature). The thermosetting film is named C-QDP-fu and C-BQTP-fu,
in which C represents cured.
