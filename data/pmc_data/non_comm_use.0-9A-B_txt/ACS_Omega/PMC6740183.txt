We describe the structure
and properties of [Zn(C6H4N5)N3]n,
a new nonporous three-dimensional high-energy metal–organic
framework (HE-MOF) with enhanced thermal stability. The compound is
synthesized by the hydrothermal method with in situ ligand formation
under controlled pH and characterized using single-crystal X-ray diffraction,
elemental analysis, and Fourier transform infrared. The measured detonation
temperature (Tdet = 345 °C) and heat
of detonation (ΔHdet = −0.380
kcal/g) compare well with commercial explosives and other nitrogen-rich
HE-MOFs. The velocity and pressure of denotation are 5.96 km/s and
9.56 GPa, respectively. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis
shows that the denotation of [Zn(C6H4N5)N3]n occurs via a complex
temperature-dependent mechanism.

==== Body
Introduction
Metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs) have attracted great interest
in materials science due to the large combination of organic ligands
and inorganic building blocks that can be used to produce novel crystalline
structures with desired properties. This structural diversity has
enabled applications in gas storage,1−3 gas separation,4−6 nonlinear optics,7−9 drug delivery,10−12 catalysis,13,14 and sensing.15,16 Recently, high-energy metal–organic
frameworks (HE-MOFs) have emerged as promising energetic materials
due to their facile synthesis, higher density, better thermal stability,
and superior mechanical strength in comparison with conventional energetic
compounds.17−22

HE-MOFs should ideally have high density, elevated heat of
detonation,
insensitivity to mechanical stress, and high thermal stability.23−29 High heats of detonation can be reached using nitrogen-rich compounds,
which have large average bond energies, such as C–N (273 kJ
mol–1), N–N (160 kJ mol–1), N=N (418 kJ mol–1), and N≡N (954
kJ mol–1).17 One promising
strategy to design HE-MOFs involves the use of five-membered nitrogen
heterocycles as ligands. In particular, pyrazole and tetrazole molecules
are promising choices due to their high heats of formation, elevated
nitrogen content, stability, and multiple coordination sites with
commonly used transition metal ions.30−35 Azido ligands can also be used to assemble HE-MOFs by introducing
the N≡N bond into the crystal structure, although the azido
group often decreases the thermal stability of materials, decreasing
their energetic performance. To increase the thermal stability of
HE-MOFs, three-dimensional (3D) coordination geometries result in
superior structural reinforcement of the energetic groups.36

In this work, we describe the energetic
properties of [Zn(C6H4N5)N3]n (1), a new 3D HE-MOF that stabilizes
3-pyridyltetrazole
and azido ligands in its structure. The obtained structure compares
well in terms of energetic group density, detonation enthalpy, and
detonation temperature with respect to other MOF structures that have
similar functional groups, as well as commercial explosives (see Figure 1). Our synthesis
strategy involves the in situ formation of 3-pyridyltetrazole ligands
in the presence of azide and cyano-compounds, via a Demko-Sharpless
reaction involving Zn2+ as a Lewis acid.37 This strategy
avoids sequential synthesis steps and the use of environmentally toxic
solvents or commonly used heavy metal ions such as Pb2+ and Ag+.

Results and Discussion
Structural Analysis
Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR)
analysis shows an intense sharp peak for asymmetric stretching at
2075 cm–1 and a second band for the symmetric stretching
of the azido group at 1281 cm–1 (Figure 2). In addition, the tetrazole
ring of compound (1) shows peaks in the region 1640–1335
cm–1 as reported for similar structures.32,33 The aromatic C–H stretching and out-of-plane bands at 3069
and 700 cm–1, respectively, are both assigned to
the pyridine ring. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) shows that
compound (1) belongs to the monoclinic crystal system
and C2/c space group (see Table 1). The asymmetric
unit is composed of a Zn atom, coordinated to both azide and 3-pyridyltetrazole
molecules (Figure 3a). The zinc(II) cation presents a distorted trigonal bipyramidal
orbital geometry, in which the nitrogens N1, N5, and N6 from tetrazolide,
pyridyl, and azido ligands, respectively, are displaced in the equatorial
plane, involving a bond length ranging between 1.9837(16) and 2.0632(15)
Å (see Table S2). Axial nitrogens
N3 and N6 from azido and tetrazolide groups form coordination bonds
with lengths in the range 2.1826(15)–2.3585(16) Å. Figure 3b shows the presence
of azido groups in the axial and equatorial positions leading to a
symmetrical arrangement of two trigonal bipyrimidal units related
by point symmetry and bonded through azido bridges by a μ-1,1
coordination mode. Compound (1) shows a three-dimensional
coordination framework, in which the azido groups are oriented into
the cavities when observed along the 010 direction (see Figure S1). Molecular dynamics modeling shows
that (1) has a helium void fraction of 0.027 and is thus
nonporous. This prediction was confirmed in N2 gas adsorption
experiments (ESI).

Thermal Decomposition
Good thermal stability is a desired
feature in energetic materials because low decomposition temperatures
limit their performance in applications. To assess the thermal stability
of (1), we performed thermogravitmetric (TG) and differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses. The results are shown in Figure 4. The TG curve shows
that there is negligible mass loss up to 325 °C, where about
49% of the initial weight is lost in an intense mass-loss process
that occurs over a small temperature range. The DSC data show a very
intense exothermic peak at 345 °C. In comparison with similar
azide-based MOFs such as Cu(DNBA)N338 and Ag2(5-ATZ)N3,39 the detonation temperature of compound (1)
is much higher. In Ag2(5-ATZ)N3, silver atoms
coordinate with 5-amino-tetrazole and azide ligands in a similar way
to that in (1). The enhanced thermostability observed
in (1) is possibly due to the bipyramidal coordination
environment, in contrast to the tetrahedral coordination geometry
found in Ag2(5-ATZ)N3. For comparison, we list
in Table 2 the energetic
properties of (1) and other energetic materials.

Energy of Combustion and Enthalpy of Formation
The
constant-volume energy of combustion of (1) was measured
using an oxygen-bomb calorimeter. From ΔH = Qp = Qv + ΔnRT, with a bomb combustion equation of the form 1  we obtain the enthalpy of combustion ΔcH = −3623 kJ mol–1, which is higher than
commercial explosives such as TNT (−3406
kJ mol–1),40 RDX (−2120
kJ mol–1), and HMX (−2820 kJ mol–1).41 This high enthalpy can be understood
from the oxidation involved in the aromatic ring breaking. From the
Hess law, we obtain the enthalpy of formation ΔfH298°(1,s) = 339 kJ mol–1.42

Detonation Parameters
The energy
of detonation is one
of the most important parameters that determine the performance of
an energetic material. Following the method proposed in refs (43, 44), the detonation reaction for compound (1) can be written as 2  We estimate the energy of
detonation from
the enthalpies of formation using the relation 3  where MW is the molecular weight of ZnC6H4N8. The estimated enthalpy of detonation
is −0.38 kcal g–1.

Structural analysis
based on the volume density of reactive groups as a function of their
thermal stability (Figure 1a) shows that structures with highly reactive group density
tend to have poor thermal stability. The three-dimensional structure
of (1) and its moderate energetic group density therefore
explain the enhanced thermal stability observed. Figure 1b shows that structures with
azoles substituted with nitro groups (ntz) and organic nitro compounds
(TNT and RDX) tend to have higher ΔHdet than nonoxygen containing groups such as 3-ptz but have much lower
thermal stabilities.

The detonation velocity (D) and detonation pressure
(P) of (1) can be obtained from ΔHdet and the semiempirical equations in ref (43) using the expressions 4  and 5  where the detonation velocity is in units
of km/s, and the detonation pressure is in GPa. ρ is the density
of the energetic material in g/cm3, N is
the number of moles of gaseous detonation products per gram of energetic
material, M is the average of molecular weight of
gases, and Q is the detonation heat of the reaction
in cal/g. Using the parameters of (1), we obtain D = 5.96 km/s and P = 9.56 GPa (see Table 2). These values are
consistent with the relatively low energy of formation and low oxygen
content of (1), which decrease the enthalpy of detonation
and the molar mass average of the gas products. Despite the low oxygen
content, the obtained heat of detonation of (1) is higher
than other energetic MOFs with tetrazole ligands as shown (see Figure 1b).

Kinetic Analysis
To study the kinetic behavior of (1), we performed
DSC measurements at different heating rates
β = 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 °C/min. The DSC peak displaces
to higher temperatures as β increases, until reaching a plateau
for β ≥ 10 °C/min. At the highest heating rates,
additional smaller peaks at temperatures beyond the main decomposition
temperature appear. The scaling of the decomposition temperature with
β could not be fitted using the Kissinger and Ozawa–Doyle
kinetic models,45−47 which points to a temperature-dependent multistep
decomposition mechanism. This behavior is different from commercial
explosives such as TNT and RDX, which fit well to the Kissinger model.48

Conclusions
We describe the synthesis
and energetic properties of a new three-dimensional
high-energy MOF with excellent thermal stability up to 345 °C.
The compound has azido and tetrazole ligands in its structure and
is obtained via the hydrothermal method with in situ ligand formation.
The reported MOF exhibits higher thermostability than typical explosives
and other three-dimensional MOFs. The measured enthalpy of combustion
(ΔcH = −3623 kJ/mol) is higher
than TNT, RDX, and HMX, but the measured heat of detonation is moderate,
possibly due to the relatively low oxygen content in the structure.
The detonation velocity was found to be D = 5.96
km/s and the pressure of detonation P = 9.56 GPa.
To better assess the potential advantage in applications of this new
high-energy MOF relative to commercial explosives, further characterization
of its chemical stability, mechanical stability, and detonation velocities
needs to be done. Moreover, differential scanning calorimetry measurements
reveal that the decomposition kinetics cannot be explained using Kissinger
and Owaza–Doyle models, which suggests a complex decomposition
mechanism that has yet to be understood.

Experimental Section
Caution
Although no explosive behavior was observed
during the synthesis, growing and handling of HE-MOFs or azido complexes
are known to be potentially explosive. Small-scale synthesis is strongly
encouraged. Manipulations must be carried out in a hood behind a safety
shield. Eye protection and leather gloves must be worn at all times.

Materials and Methods
The crystal structures of both
solvates were determined by X-ray diffraction at 293 K. Data collection
was done on a SMART CCD diffractometer using f- and o-scans as the
data collection strategy. Data sets were reduced using SAINT,49 while the structures were solved by direct methods
and completed by Difference Fourier Synthesis for nonhydrogen atoms.
Least-squares refinement was conducted by using SHELXL.50 (Multiscan absorption corrections were applied
using SADABS.49) The hydrogen atom positions
were calculated after each cycle of refinement with SHELXL using a
riding model for each structure, with a C–H distance of 0.93
Å. Uiso(H) values
were set equal to 1.2 Ueq of the parent
carbon atom. The thermogravimetric analyses were done on a Mettler
Toledo model TGA/DSC 2 Star equipment. The TGA curves were registered
in the 20–600 °C range, using a 10 °C/min heating
rate under nitrogen atmosphere (40 mL/min). DSC experiments were performed
at 1, 5, 10, 15 and 20 °C/min. IR spectra was recorded on a Spectrum
Two FTIR Spectrometer. The elemental analyses were done on a FLASH
2000 CHN Analyzer equipment. Powder X-ray diffraction analysis was
done using a Shimadzu XRD 6000 diffractometer with Cu Kα (l = 1.5418 Å) radiation for structural characterization
and phase determination. Calculated PXRD patterns were generated using
Mercury 3.10. The constant-volume energy of combustion was measured
in an oxygen-bomb calorimeter (Parr 6200, Parr instruments Company,
Illinois, USA) and using samples of 0.55 g according to UNE-EN 14918
standard for biosolid fuels. Finally, all reactants were used without
purification and the pH was monitored using a pH 2700 Oakton pH meter.
Textural properties were obtained from the adsorption–desorption
isotherm of N2 at 77 K, which was carried out using a Micromeritics
3Flex instrument. The sample was previously degassed for 10 h at 413
K under vacuum using a Micromeritics Smart VacPrep instrument. All
gas-intake simulations were performed assuming a rigid MOF structure
using the grand canonical Monte Carlo molecular simulation scheme
on the software RASPA.51 A 2 × 4 ×
3 supercell for calculation was set to use a 12 Å cutoff for
the intermolecular interactions in the system. Five thousand cycles
of initialization and another five thousand for the actual ensemble
average simulations were done totalizing 10 000 cycles. Partial
atomic charges for the atoms of the framework were obtained by the
charge equilibration method (QEq). Generic MOFs and Trappe force-field
definitions were employed for the MOF atoms and the N2 and
CO2 gases, respectively. Temperatures for the isotherm
estimation were 77 K in the N2 case and 274 K for CO2.

Synthesis of Zn(3-ptz)N3 (1)
All of the reactants and chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
and utilized without further purification. A mixture of 3-cyanopyridine
(4 mmol), NaN3 (8 mmol), and Zn(CH3COO)2 (8 mmol) were dissolved in 6 mL of distilled water. The pH
value was adjusted by using HNO3 (66%) until reaching pH
in the range 2.7–2.8. The mixture was transferred into a glass
bottle and then put in a box furnace at 105 °C for 24 h. The
as-synthesized materials were taken out of the furnace after 24 h,
filtered, and dried at room temperature prior to the structural analysis.
