Achieving ultrasmall dimensions of materials and retaining high throughput
are critical fabrication considerations for nanotechnology use. This
article demonstrates an integrated approach for developing isolated
sub-20 nm silicon oxide features through combined “top-down”
and “bottom-up” methods: nanoimprint lithography (NIL)
and block copolymer (BCP) lithography. Although techniques like those
demonstrated here have been developed for nanolithographic application
in the microelectronics processing industry, similar approaches could
be utilized for sensor, fluidic, and optical-based devices. Thus,
this article centers on looking at the possibility of generating isolated
silica structures on substrates. NIL was used to create intriguing
three-dimensional (3-D) polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS)
topographical arrays that guided and confined polystyrene-block-poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PS-b-PDMS)
BCP nanofeatures in isolated regions. A cylinder forming PS-b-PDMS BCP system was successfully etched using a one-step
etching process to create line-space arrays with a period of 35 nm
in confined POSS arrays. We highlight large-area (>6 μm)
coverage
of line-space arrays in 3-D topographies that could potentially be
utilized, for example, in nanofluidic systems. Aligned features for
directed self-assembly application are also demonstrated. The high-density,
confined silicon oxide nanofeatures in soft lithographic templates
over macroscopic areas illustrate the advantages of integrating distinct
lithographic methods for attaining discrete features in the deep nanoscale
regime.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Scientific
interest in developing innovative patterning methods based on “bottom-up”
or “top-down” paradigms that allow fabrication of sub-100
nm features for semiconductor feature size scaling has increased immensely
over the past decade.1,2 The ability to generate ultrahigh-density
and highly resolved patterns using conventional UV photolithography
at appropriate costs has necessitated the search for a nontraditional
patterning technique to augment the lithographic process. Electron
beam lithography (EBL) can possibly achieve the desired dimensions;
however, its serial write scheme is a major drawback for photomask
development.3 Nanoimprint lithography (NIL)
has emerged as a promising technique for the robust formation of sub-50
nm features. In principle, NIL is a straightforward concept based
on a mechanical force being applied on a mold (that contains features
to be imprinted) atop a thermal- or ultraviolet-sensitive resist layer.4 Research on NIL materials (both molds and resists)
to enhance the final pattern integrity has advanced endlessly.5 In parallel, industry-driven efforts are heavily
investigating directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCPs)
to reach ultrasmall features for increased device performance.6,7 However, in addition to this obvious application area, integrating
scalable patterning processes with high throughput could be significant
to meeting other nanotechnological needs and may be applied in areas
where the placement of features is not as stringent as integrated
circuit layouts, for example, in sensors, membranes, and batteries.8,9

To date, DSA demonstration has primarily used either topographical
(graphoepitaxy) or chemical (chemoepitaxy) prepatterns to guide BCP
features.10−20 More recently, synergistic approaches that combine NIL and BCP lithography
have shown significant promise for DSA. Here, the guiding topography
is created using reusable NIL stamps to replicate features. For example,
Olynick and co-workers21 used a silicon
mold coated with a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) brush layer to imprint
a polystyrene (PS)-block-PDMS (PS-b-PDMS) BCP thin film to fabricate sub-10 nm features. It was found
that the mold coated with a PDMS brush layer was easily unmolded from
the PS-b-PDMS films. Molds were used up to 10 times
before reapplication of the PDMS brush layer was necessary. Additionally, Seagate has reported
excellent demonstrations of sphere-forming PS-b-PDMS
systems (at >1 teradot/in.2) with NIL (and optical lithography)
for application in developing ultrahigh-density bit-patterned magnetic
storage media.3,22,23 We have previously utilized NIL and BCP methods for DSA purposes
on polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS)-derived substrates
to create aligned line-space and pillar features with excellent coverage
over large areas.24 Resist designs have
been optimized to show control over cylinder orientation depending
on the existence or absence of trench base material.

The key
objective of this current work is to expand NIL and BCP
lithography to nontraditional guiding templates, which may open up
large-area-controlled routes to patterning of nanometer features for
alternative nanoapplications in biomolecule detection, host arrays
for complex material deposition, and scaffold materials for filtration
media. Although ease of fabrication is attractive for such applications,
the ability to reproducibly create large surface coverage of nanofeatures
is advantageous. Little work has been carried out on examining the
self-assembly of BCPs in nontraditional guiding templates. In this
work, soft graphoepitaxy is employed via the imprinting of a PDMS
mold on a POSS resist to confine BCP material following solvent vapor
annealing (SVA). Organized PS-b-PDMS BCP films were
etched to produce uniform high-density silicon dioxide line-space
features confined within the three-dimensional (3-D) NIL POSS resist
topographies. The results described in this report extend the level
of sophistication of NIL/BCP templating and, in particular, for achieving
high-throughput guiding patterns over large areas using NIL, surpassing
the often used EBL processes that are expensive and time consuming.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 UV-NIL Imprinting on Epoxy–POSS
Resin
POSS geometries on silicon substrates were fabricated
using UV-NIL
with elastomeric molds (so-called “soft UV-NIL”) in
the POSS resist. Epoxy–POSS resin used in the present investigation
was generously provided by PROFACTOR GmbH, Austria. The silicon masters
were prepared using EBL. Prior to imprinting, original silicon oxide
master molds were vapor-coated with an antisticking layer of 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane (Optool DSX; Daikin Chemical). This
allows easy mold release after the imprinting and curing processes.
The antisticking layer had a thickness of about 3 nm and resulted
in a surface free energy of 110.5 mN/m for even demolding. PDMS stamps
were fabricated using the original silicon oxide master molds.

Resin solutions were made by dissolving appropriate amounts of the
POSS resist in propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate, followed
by the addition of 2 mol % (relative to epoxy groups) Irgacure 250
(photoinitiator absorbing in the wavelength range of 275–325
nm) and 0.5 wt % Genocure ITX (sensitizer absorbing in the wavelength
range of 340–400 nm) to provide UV sensitivity. Solutions were
spin-coated on silicon substrates previously surface-treated with
O2 plasma (to remove contamination) to form resist films
of various thicknesses.

The imprinting process was performed
immediately by repeatedly
stamping the PDMS molds over the resin-coated substrates at a pressure
of 200 kPa and exposing to UV radiation (365 nm in wavelength) for
3 min to cure the resist. The process formed a resist residual layer
(≈15 nm thick) at the bottom of the topography that was removed
by CF4 (15 sccm) plasma treatment for 5 s with inductively
coupled plasma (ICP) and reactive ion-etching (RIE) powers of 400
and 30 W, respectively, at 2.0 Pa with a helium backside cooling pressure
of 1333.2 Pa.

2.2 Deposition of PS-b-PDMS and
Solvent Vapor Annealing
Thin films of PS-b-PDMS (31–11k, polydispersity = 1.12; purchased from Polymer
Source Inc., Canada) were prepared by depositing a dilute solution
(1.0 wt %) of BCP in toluene onto POSS substrates. As-cast thin films
were solvent-annealed in glass jars under saturated toluene environment
at room temperature (≈288 K) for 3 h. Samples were removed
from the glass jars after the desired anneal time and allowed to evaporate
the trapped solvent under ambient conditions.

2.3 Plasma
Etching of PS-b-PDMS
Films to Form Silicon Oxide Features
Solvent-annealed BCP
films were subjected to an initial SF6 plasma (7 sccm)
with 30 W RIE and 50 W ICP powers at 2.0 Pa pressure for 3 s to remove
the upper PDMS wetting layer. This was followed by an O2 plasma treatment for 10 s with 2000 W ICP and 400 W RIE powers at
2.0 Pa pressure to selectively etch the exposed PS component. These
steps followed a similar methodology developed by Ross and Jung.25

2.4 Contact Angle and Surface
Free Energy
Contact angles were measured by the static sessile
drop method. Surface
free energy was calculated from the measured contact angles of deionized
water, diiodomethane, and ethylene glycol using the Owens–Wendt
model.26 Contact angles and surface free
energy measurements were carried out using a Krüss DSA 100
goniometer.

2.5 Scanning Electron Microscopy
(SEM)
SEM images of etched BCP films were obtained by a Field
Emission
Zeiss Ultra Plus SEM with a Gemini column operating at an accelerating
voltage of 3 kV. All SEM images shown are following PS removal by
O2 plasma leading to consequential oxidation of the PDMS
block.

3 Results and Discussion
PS-b-PDMS BCPs have been explored with respect
to lithographic patterning for two key reasons: (i) a high Flory–Huggins
interaction parameter (χ ∼ 0.26) allowing small feature
sizes and (ii) high etch contrast stemming from the presence of silicon
in the PDMS backbone, allowing a facile pattern transfer to the underlying
substrate. Therefore, PS-b-PDMS was chosen for this
study to produce silicon oxide features that can potentially be used
for DSA purposes and to create a demonstration for other technologies
requiring precisely located discrete nanofeatures.

Three-dimensional
POSS resist topographies were fabricated over
large areas using NIL technology (see Experimental
Section and Scheme 1). The resin was considered owing to its high modulus that
allows high-fidelity nanoimprinting and prevents structure collapse
during demolding.27 The chemical structure
of the resin is presented in Table S1 along
with its wetting characteristics. The surface free energies of PS
and PDMS are 44.0 and 21.8 mN/m,28 respectively.
It is evident that the surface free energy of epoxy–POSS is
very close to that of PS.

Scheme 1 Process Integrating NIL and BCP Lithography
To Achieve Silicon Oxide
Nanofeatures
Following the development
of POSS geometries, a dilute toluene
PS-b-PDMS (31–11k) solution was spin-coated
on the POSS guiding patterns. SVA29 of
the thin PS-b-PDMS films in toluene vapors for 3
h produced microphase-separated features with PDMS cylinders confined
within a PS matrix. After SVA, selective etching of films is necessary
using CF4 to remove the PDMS polymer/air interface wetting
layer and O2 gas to remove the PS matrix and convert PDMS
to SiO2. This allows SEM inspection of the remaining oxidized
PDMS cylinders (see Scheme 1(iv)).

In our experiments, the initial data presented
are based on forming
silicon oxide line-space features on conventional architectures, for
example, simple flat topographies and parallel topographies to form
aligned features as found in DSA works. The SEM images in Figure 1a,b display characteristic
silicon oxide line-space features in large POSS topographic areas,
such as those developed on planar substrates from PS-b-PDMS BCPs. We have previously shown the self-assembly behavior of
PS-b-PDMS BCP systems using microwave annealing and
SVA on planar and guiding patterns.30−32 Additionally, we have
illustrated PS-b-PDMS alignment on parallel POSS
features via SVA.24,33 Toluene possesses a solubility
parameter of 18.5 M Pa1/2 and is a commonly employed solvent
for SVA of PS-b-PDMS films to induce segregation
of the respective blocks. Thus, toluene is primarily selective to
the majority PS block. The large scale area shown in Figure 1b also exemplifies the superiority
of NIL to common optical-based patterning methods like EBL, which
are restricted because of the long patterning times required. This
is a clear demonstration that NIL combined with BCP lithography can
allow large scale patterning in a high-throughput fashion. The methods
shown here address these two critical requirements for next-generation
patterning.

(a, b) Top-down SEM images of characteristic PS-b-PDMS “fingerprint” patterns in nanoimprinted circular
resists.

Figure 1a,b reveals
well-defined silicon oxide line-space features in POSS-generated templates.
The feature size and period (i.e., center-to-center spacing) were
measured at ∼19 and ∼35 nm (Figure 1a) and at ∼18 and ∼36 nm (Figure 1b).

POSS resists
are an extremely effective resist material due to
ease of processing for creating fine features and the associated long-term
stability for nanolithography use. Equally, the optimization and understanding
from our previous studies mentioned above have enabled the tuning
of surface–polymer interactions to create defined discrete
BCP arrays. In our earlier reports, we presented key results demonstrating
that POSS materials can be used with similar efficacy to polymer brushes
(e.g., hydroxyl-terminated PS and PDMS) to dictate BCP microdomain
orientation to the underlying substrate.24 With this knowledge, we have tailored conditions in this work to
form uniform silicon oxide arrays in NIL resists.

Figure 2 shows an
SEM image of typical DSA approach, where isolated and aligned silicon
oxide line-space features can be formed over large areas. One observes
that line-space features can be fabricated with good long-range order
over macroscopic areas through NIL and BCP lithography. The periodicity
of the features is ∼35 nm, similar to the dimensions observed
on planar topographies in Figure 1. The POSS resist mesas have dimensions of ∼245
nm, whereas the channel/trench widths are varied as indicated in Figure 2. The top-down SEM
image shows that varying channel widths can fabricate different numbers
of silicon oxide line-space features. For example, trench widths measuring
∼150 nm lead to 5 silicon oxide features, whereas 10 lines
can be produced in 350 nm channel widths, as indicated in the image.
This demonstrates the excellent synergistic potential of NIL/BCP techniques
to fulfill large scale patterning of features in the deep nanoscale
regime. The high-resolution SEM inset in Figure 2 also reveals the uniformity of the silicon
oxide features with varying line features with respect to increasing
trench size. In contrast, larger trenches do not dictate such strict
control of features (see Figure S1, Supporting Information (SI)). The image in Figure 2 shows the ability to alter and manipulate
the number of line features within a respective trench. This is a
relatively challenging practice with EBL methods over such a small
scale area. The inset illustrates the precision that we can tailor
an area to include 5 or 10 silicon oxide features depending on the
dimensions fabricated by NIL. Such features are ideal for DSA etch
mask application, and recent reports have demonstrated high levels
of success in pattern transferring silicon oxide masks derived from
PS-b-PDMS materials to various substrates.34,35 Important steps forward have been reported in the literature for
pattern transferring PS-b-PMDS BCPs leading to high-fidelity
features using pulsed laser practices.36

Figure 2 Top-down
SEM of PS-b-PDMS patterns showing alignment
of features over a macroscopic region.

The low-resolution SEM image in Figure 3a displays a large scale area (∼5
× 5 μm2) of silicon oxide line-space features
surrounding periodic oval-shaped POSS postfeatures generated through
NIL. The image displays retention of the POSS geometry after NIL and
characteristic silicon oxide line-space features following patterning
with PS-b-PDMS and selective plasma-etching procedures
(see Experimental Section for details). A
uniform monolayer of silicon oxide features is evident with the characteristic
BCP fingerprint pattern. Silicon oxide feature size was measured at
∼17 nm with a periodicity (L0)
of ∼35 nm. The inset shows that PDMS has an attraction to this
circular POSS feature in comparison to the larger features generated
in Figure 1a. Figure 3b,c also shows examples
of large areas, where oval-shaped POSS posts exist combined with silicon
oxide features resulting from microphase-separated PS-b-PDMS thin films. Figure 3b displays an SEM image of a more “conventional”
pattern of line features, whereas Figure 3c shows a more sophisticated pattern geometry
driven by the intricate nature of the POSS NIL resist. The square
POSS pattern contains a POSS post that fills the centre of the square
and is surrounded by aligned self-assembled features. The features
shown are unique (see Figure 3c) to previously reported works and further reinforce the
ability of BCPs to pattern more complex features than conceived. Furthermore,
the types of structures reported here and below add to the capabilities
of di-BCP materials to pattern and form exotic structures. This has
been made possible due to the excellent microphase separation ability
of PS-b-PDMS. Moreover, NIL has the ability to fabricate
uniform topographic resists over large areas (i.e., macroscale) with
intricate patterns surpassing those produced by EBL or other slow
and costly lithographic methods.

Figure 3 Top-down SEM images of PS-b-PDMS line-space features
patterned around (a) ∼100 nm POSS postarrays, (b) ∼450
nm POSS postpatterns, and (c) confined within a complex square geometry.

Figure 4a–c
displays a range of intriguing POSS topographies following BCP patterning
with PS-b-PDMS. Figure 4a is composed of two varying circular guiding
topographies, where silicon oxide features assemble in a concentric
manner. One should note the excellent uniform curvature of the silicon
oxide nanostructures within the POSS resists in Figure 4a–c. This is not only a result of
the high interfacial width between PS and PDMS (due to the material’s
high χ) but also due to the nature of the POSS sidewalls. The
SEM image in Figure 4a shows the excellent performance potential of NIL technology with
a “high-χ” BCP material to pattern concentric
features. In contrast, the wider, less-defined topographic patterns
displayed in Figure 4b did not result in concentric self-assembly of the PS-b-PDMS BCP. Fingerprint patterns were observed in the larger topographic
patterns and in the smaller-diameter topographic patterns. With more
uniform periodic cylinder-shaped topographies, concentric patterns
with high reproducibility across large areas resulted, as shown in Figure 4c. The high-resolution
SEM inset in Figure 4c also shows that the PDMS dominates the inner part of the pattern.
This has been reported to occur as a result of the diameter of the
topography, as was previously outlined for PS-b-PMMA
BCP systems.17 These uniform structures
could be used as templates for (i) pattern-transfer masks to create
diverse silica nanostructures or (ii) incorporating metal oxide materials
via evaporation or sputtering methods. More intricate examples of
3-D POSS geometries with PS-b-PDMS features are displayed
in Figures S2 and S3, SI.

Figure 4 Macroscopic coverage
revealed by SEM analysis of PS-b-PDMS patterns showing
a circular or ring conformation in (a) irregular
patterns, (b) varying circular patterns, and (c) periodically imprinted
circular features with equal spacing and size.

Figure 5a
displays
silicon oxide line features after self-assembly and etching on a cross-imprinted
POSS pattern with the presence of a POSS line at the center. One observes
characteristic fingerprint structures in the open area of the topographic
template. This is evident from the inset in Figure 5a, where nanofeatures with no directed assembly
structures are formed. However, such features demonstrating large-scale
control of uniform assembly and location (i.e., within NIL topographies)
may be useful in bioassay studies, where sensitivity could be analyzed
in patterned versus unpatterned areas. More complex patterns have
also been explored as shown in Figure 5b. Self-assembly was achieved in “banana”-like
topographies that are of varying widths and lengths. Well-defined
uniform silicon oxide features are generated, as seen in the inset
in Figure 5b.

and uniform PS-b-PDMS patterns in (a) cross-shaped
features and (b) banana-like topographies.

4 Conclusions
The results presented and discussed
in this article bring forward
the areas of BCP patterning and NIL technology for unconventional
topographic geometries. The synergistic approach of confining PS-b-PDMS thin films within an NIL POSS resist produced excellent
silicon oxide nanofeatures for both DSA application and more exotic
3-D topographic resist patterns. More work is required to achieve
better alignment in the nontraditional templates used here so that
the overall process can be applied in nanoapplications. The patterned
features also contribute to the area of “soft” graphoepitaxy
using a light-sensitive material that can be patterned with high uniformity
over macroscopic areas, as demonstrated here.
