In the present study, the effects of the corrosive bacterial
community
and the biofilm on cooling water systems made from mild steel (MS)
and brass (BR) were studied under field exposure conditions using
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements, scanning electron
microscope, and X-ray diffraction methods. Results from16S rRNA gene
sequences showed that the predominant bacteria species detected in
the biofilm of MS and BR metals during 360 days of exposure were Bacillus cereus EN14, Achromobacter xylosoxidans EN15, A. xylosoxidans EN16, and B. cereus EN17. The weight loss results revealed
that a higher corrosion rate was observed in MS (0.7 ± 0.1 mm/y)
compared with that in BR (0.17 ± 0.05 mm/y) at the end of the
exposure period. This can be explained by the bacterial communities
enhancing the corrosion rates by creating a local corrosive environment.
Scanning electron microscope images revealed the adsorption of biofilm
on the MS and BR surfaces following180 days of exposure. From the
electrochemical impedance study, a higher charge transfer resistance
(Rct) was obtained for BR (119.6 Ω
cm2) when compared with that of MS (43.4 Ω cm2). This study explains the role of bacterial communities and
their mechanisms in the corrosion of MS and BR in cooling water systems.

Introduction
Corrosion is broadly defined as the deterioration
of a metal surface
due to the interaction between metals and their environment.1 Microbially influenced corrosion (MIC) is an electrochemical reaction
that enhances the corrosion process due to microbial metabolites (sulfide,
organic acids, inorganic acids, and ammonia3−6). Bacterial metabolites change
the environmental conditions (such as salinity, acidity, and oxygen
concentration) around metal surfaces, which lead to the formation
of corrosion on the materials.4,7,8 MIC is often associated with iron-oxidizing bacteria,9 iron-reducing bacteria,10 sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB),11 acid-producing
bacteria,12 and fungi.13 Cooling water systems (CWSs) are used to remove and dissipate
wasted heat to the surrounding environment. The industrial systems
consist of cooling towers, pipeline circulation water, pumps, and
heat exchangers.14,15 In general, cooling towers remove
heat through evaporation, and dissolved constituents are removed in
the recirculating water. The recirculation water has a higher content
of recycled water than fresh water. This promotes biofilm formation
and corrosion.16,17 Biocorrosion has significant
economic and ecological impacts. Several models have been documented
to describe its fundamental mechanisms.18

Extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) play an important
role
in facilitating microbial cell adhesion to iron surfaces and form
biofilms on metal surfaces. EPSs are believed to be polymeric conglomerations
(proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids), which lead to the biosorption
ability to iron ions.19 In general, EPSs
consist of functional groups that can easily bind to metal surfaces,
thereby increasing the corrosion rates due to the biofilm, and result
in the enhancement of cathodic reactions.20 Currently, mild steel (MS) and brass (BR) are used extensively as
metals in CWSs due to their excellent insulation properties, easy
construction properties, and low cost.21,22 The rate of
metal corrosion is impacted by the deposition of gaseous compounds,
relative humidity (RH), temperature, moisture, and biological aerosols
on the metal surface.23−26

Results and Discussion
Bacteriological Analysis of Cooling Water System
Preliminary
identification of the isolates by biochemical tests reveals that EN14
and EN17 are reported as facultative Gram-positive, aerobic, rod-shaped,
catalase-producing, motile, and oxidase-positive bacteria. EN15 and
EN16 are reported as Gram-negative, rod-shaped, motile, catalase-producing,
and oxidase-positive bacteria. The biochemical characterization results
are presented in Table 2. The obtained sequence was aligned and compared with GenBank. The
results showed >99% homology with Bacillus cereus and Achromobacter
xylosoxidans. Hence, these organisms
have been named B. cereus EN14, A. xylosoxidans EN15, A. xylosoxidans EN16, and B. cereus EN17. The sequences
were subjected to a BLAST search to repossess the consequent phylogenetic
relationship. The phylogenetic relationship was confirmed by the prediction
table of each related species by the taxonomy and categorization packing order in
accordance with the NCBI tools. Figure 1 shows the cluster-tree analysis of the relationship
between isolates and related species. The EN14, EN15, EN16, and EN17
gene sequences were submitted to GenBank, and accession numbers of
MF803659, MF803660, MF803661 and MF803662, respectively, were obtained.

Biocorrosion and Surface Analysis
The WL and corresponding
corrosion rates of MS and BR are presented in Table 3. In MS, an average WL of 2.7 ± 0.6
g and an average corrosion rate (CR) of 0.7 ± 0.1 mm/year were obtained following an exposure period
of 360 days. During the initial 90 day exposure period, the CR of
MS was determined to be 0.729 ± 0.2 mm/year, and the rate steadily
increased to 1.054 ± 0.5 mm/year after an additional 90 days
of exposure following the initial 90 days of exposure. However, during
the next 180 days, the CR decreased to 0.7 ± 0.1 mm/year due
to its re-passivation of iron oxide and it might lead to the decreased
biofilm activity, thus reducing corrosion. The atmospheric environmental
CR decreased with long exposure time. This result is supported by
earlier reports.27,28

The results for BR were similar to those for MS. Values
of WL and
corresponding CR are presented in Table 3. The average WL and CR values were determined
to be 0.7 ± 0.1 g and 0.17 ± 0.05 mm/year, respectively,
at the end of the exposure period. Following the initial 90 day exposure
period, the WL of BR was determined to be 0.141 ± 0.01 g and
constantly increased thereafter to 0.631 ± 0.2 g after a total
of 270 days. The WL was higher for MS when compared with BR over the
exposure period. The initial CR was higher and could be attributable
to the presence of biofilms and sessile cells that are directly in
contact with the metal surface, thereby creating a condition that
is favorable to corrosion.29 Conversely,
it is not inconceivable that, after the initial exposure period, a
protective layer had formed on the metal surface, which led to limited
contact of the metal with the microbes and a reduction in the CR.30

A. xylosoxidans and B. cereus are catalase-producing
bacteria. Their
related biochemical characterizations are presented in Table 2. A bacterial catalase enzyme
was used to neutralize the cells during bacterial metabolites, which
led to the formation of oxygen and the oxidation of metal ions. This
process is termed catalase-mediated corrosion.20,31 The chloride concentration of the cooling tower water was found
to increase during the exposure period. The higher concentration of
chloride (200 mg/L) was noticed at the end of the immersion. This
observation reveals that chloride ions also contribute to the observed
corrosion in both metals.

This bacterial community is able to
consume oxygen and produce
water molecules (eq 1). 1  

The bacterial biofilm
supports the Fenton reaction32 by reducing
the metal ions, which leads to the formation
of hydroxyl radicals (eq 2). The Fe3+ ions produced from the reaction further react
with OH– ions to form ferric hydroxide (eq 3) as a corrosion product
on metal surfaces. 2   3  

XRD data from the corrosion
product collected from the cooling
water exposure of MS and BR metals are presented in Figure 2. Ferrous sulfide (FeS), iron
oxychloride (FeOCl), iron hydroxide (FeOOH), and iron oxide (Fe2O3) were observed (Figure 2Aa). Copper oxide (Cu2O) and Cu(OH)2 (Figure 2Ba)
were observed in the initial 90 day exposure period. Upon increasing
the exposure period (180 days), higher intensities of Fe2O3, FeOCl, and Cu2O were observed (Figure 2Ab,Bb), which indicates
the higher rate of corrosion on the metal surface. On the other hand,
a prolonged exposure period led to a decrease in the intensity of the peaks due to the re-passivation
of the surface film. This phenomenon occurred up until the end of
the exposure period (360 days).

at different immersion
periods: (a) 90, (b) 180, (c) 270, and (d) 360 days.

The SEM of MS and BR at various exposure times
(Figure 3) showed the
development of
a bacterial biofilm and its increase over time. Thicker biofilm formation
was observed from SEM results for both MS and BR after 180 days (Figure 3c). The occurrence
of MIC is concurrent with the production of EPSs and cellular adhesion
during biofilm formation on the metal surface. These processes lead
to a significant alteration of the metal interface, which acts as
a barrier to the swapping of elements between the aqueous phase and
metal surface. The higher production of EPSs on the metal surface
results in differential aeration and alteration of the pH and redox
reactions (potential difference) on the metal surfaces, which ultimately
leads to the corrosion process.33

Electrochemical Studies
The impedance curve for the
MS and BR metals at different exposure periods is shown in Figure 4; associated data
is presented in Table 4. The Nyquist curves for MS and BR exhibited a semicircle at the
initial exposure period (90 days). After 90 days, a depressed semicircle
was observed and charge transfer resistance (Rct) values for MS and BR were lower (461 and 710 Ω cm2, respectively) than values obtained from the initial exposure
period (978.5 and 1576 Ω cm2, respectively). This
indicated the occurrence of corrosion reactions on the metal surfaces.34−36 Following 270 days of exposure, the Rct values for MS and BR were found to be higher (966.9 and 1466.5 Ω
cm2, respectively) than values obtained after 180 days.
This indicates a decrease in the corrosion rate on the metal surface;37 Natesan et al.30 reported
that a prolonged exposure period led the development of a thick corrosion
product layer on the metal surface, and thus limiting the contact
of corrosive bacterial species with the metal surface, thereby reducing
the CR.

Tafel polarization curves and data for MS and BR are
presented
in Figure 5 and Table 5, respectively. During
the initial exposure period, polarization resistances (Rp) for MS and BR were approximately 2.4 and 2.4 kΩ
cm2, respectively. However, after 90 days, the Rp values (1.3 and 2 kΩ cm2,
respectively) were shown to have decreased. In contrast, during the
initial 90 day exposure period, corrosion current values (icorr) for MS and BR (46 and 14 μA/cm2, respectively) were less than the values obtained after 90
days (77 and 69 μA/cm2, respectively). This can be explained by the formation of a corrosion film by
bacterial species.38,39,45 Remarkably, following 270 days of exposure, the icorr values for MS and BR (30 and 61 μA/cm2, respectively) and Rp values (4 and
3 kΩ cm2, respectively) were less than values obtained
after 180 days. Hence, it can be concluded that the corrosion rate
decreased after longer times of exposure. These results are further
substantiated by other studies.28,40 Thus, the EIS results
also supported the WL studies and confirmed the higher corrosion rates
that were found to occur during the initial exposure period compared
with the end of the exposure period (360 days). MS was found to have
a higher corrosion rate when compared to BR.

Conclusions
The present study investigated the role
of a bacterial biofilm
on CWSs made of MS and BR. A. xylosoxidans and B. cereus were identified as
the corrosive bacteria species on metal surfaces in the CWS that were
examined by WL, XRD, SEM, and EIS. XRD confirmed the presence of Fe
and Cu oxide as part of the corrosion products. This indicated that
the isolated bacteria are able to convert the elements on the MS and
BR surfaces. The result was further corroborated by the electrochemical
data (EIS and polarization). The results from this study demonstrated
that bacteria accelerate the corrosion of MS and BR due to bacterial
metabolism. Results from the WL experiment confirmed that BR has a
higher resistance of corrosion than MS. This study demonstrated that
the bacterial community enhances the corrosion of CWSs made of various
engineering materials. This study contributes to an expansion of the
current knowledge pertaining to the role of bacteria and the mechanisms
of corrosion that are essential to the selection of biocides or corrosion
inhibitors that can be used to control corrosion in processing industries.

Materials and Method
Background Information of the Cooling Tower Water
The
processing facility (cooling tower) used in this study is located
at a chemical processing site in Sipcot, Ranipet, Vellore district,
Tamilnadu, India (latitude, 12.953671° and longitude, 79.313132°).
The tower has a dimension of 3.4 m × 2.8 m × 1.0 m (water
depth) and a capacity of 1000 m3/h. The temperature was
maintained at ∼31.2 °C. Physiochemical characteristics
of the water are presented in Table 1.

Preparation of Metal Samples
Coupons of MS 1010 (0.16%
carbon, 0.37% silicon, 1.24% manganese, 0.027% phosphorus, 0.026%
sulfur, 0.19% copper, 0.007% nitrogen, 0.02% aluminum, and 97.96%
iron) and BR coupons (16% zinc, 0.05% iron, 0.05% lead, and 60.66%
copper) were exposed to the cooling tower water system to examine
the susceptibility of the metal to biofilm formation. Each metal coupon
was sequentially ground with a series of grit silicon carbide papers
(grades 180, 500, 800, 1200, and 1500) to produce a smooth metal surface
and ultimately polished to a mirror finish surface using micron alumina
(0.3) powder. The refined coupons were rinsed with distilled water,
and further surface sterilization was carried out by immersing in
70% ethanol solution for 1 min. After sterilization, the coupons were
stored in a desiccator until they were ready for further use. Two
different sizes of metal coupons were used in the present investigation:
a round coupon with diameter of 10 mm for EIS analysis and a 7.5 cm
× 1 cm × 0.1 cm coupon for the weight loss experiment.41

Polished MS 1010 and BR metal coupons
were exposed to the cooling tower water system under field conditions.
After different time intervals of 90, 180, 270, and 360 days, both
types of coupons were removed from the cooling tower water and subjected
to 16S rRNA, WL, EIS, XRD, and SEM analyses.

Bacterial Community Analysis
Biofilm samples were collected
from the surface of immersed metal coupons (MS and BR) and analyzed
for identification of aerobic bacteria. The biofilm samples were serially
diluted (10-fold) and plated using a pour plate technique on the following
sterile selective media: American Petroleum Institute (API) medium,
iron-oxidizing medium (IOM), and manganese bacterial agar (MA).2 The total viable counts were enumerated on each
sterile selective agar plates, and bacterial populations were articulated
as colony-forming units (CFU/mL) after an incubation period of 24–48
hours at 37 °C. Dissimilar morphology bacterial colonies were
selected randomly and purified by the streak plate method on specific
sterile agar plates. The resulting bacterial isolates were identified
according to (1) Gram staining, (2) motility test, (3) indole production,
(4) methyl red test, (5) citrate utilization test, (6) Voges–Proskauer
test, (7) carbohydrate fermentation test, (8) catalase test, (9) oxidase
test, (10) gelatin content, (11) starch content, and (12) lipid hydrolysis
test.42

Molecular Identification of Aerobic Bacteria and Phylogenetic
Analysis
Bacterial genomic DNA extraction was adopted from
the work of Weisberg et al.43 Bacterial
genomic DNA was subjected to amplification by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) using universal primers, 16S rRNA forward primer 5′-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′
and reverse primer 5′-ACGGCTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′.44,45 PCR was performed with 50 μL of reaction mixture containing
1.5 mM MgCl2, 2 μL of template DNA, forward and reverse
primers (0.5 μM dNTP at a concentration of 50 μM, 1μL
of TaqDNA polymerase, and 5μL of buffer as
recommended by the manufacturer, MBI Fermentas), the reaction was
adopted from ref (2). PCR products were purified using a Montage PCR Cleanup kit (Millipore)
for DNA sequencing and using a Big Dye terminator cycle sequencing
kit (Applied BioSystems, USA), and the obtained bacterial 16S rRNA
sequences were determined using an automated DNA sequencing system
(model 3730XL, Applied BioSystems, USA).

The obtained sequences
were examined by a BLAST search (version 2.2.2046), and the taxonomic hierarchy of the sequences was identified
using the Ribosomal Database Project II Release 10 (http://rdp.cme.msu.edu). A taxonomically
related sequence was acquired from the National Centre for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) taxonomy database and Ribosomal Database Project-II
(Release 10). Phylogenetic association and sequence resemblance analysis
were performed on frequent 16S rRNA gene regions, and misaligned sequences
were treated using the MEGA software program (version 4.1).27 Phylogenetic trees were constructed by a neighbor-joining
method, and Mat GAT (version 2.01) was used to analyze the similitude
percentages between sequences.

Biocorrosion and Surface Analysis
For the weight loss
experiment, the metal coupons were pickled with Clark solution followed
by drying with an air drier. Triplicate experiments were conducted
for each system. The final weights of each coupon were taken in every
90 day time interval, and the average corrosion rates were calculated
following the NACE standard protocol (NACE 2005). At the end of the
corrosion experiment, the corrosion products were carefully collected
and subjected to surface analysis (XRD and SEM). The corrosion products
were crushed into fine powder and used for XRD analysis. A system
controlled XRD (Bruker-8030) between 2θ of 10 to 85° was
used.47 SEM analyses were carried out in
a JEOL JSM5600 to assess the bacterial grouping. The biofilm was fixed
on the metal surface using 3% glutaraldehyde in a phosphate buffer
solution, left overnight, and washed with different amounts of ethanol
(25, 50, 75, and 95%). The metal sample was dried and subjected to
SEM; this analysis was conducted at time intervals of 90 days during
the incubation period.48

Electrochemical Studies
Corrosion characterization
of MS and BR metal coupons was carried out by EIS. Impedance and polarization
were conducted in a three-electrode electrochemical cell (CH Instrument
Inc., USA model CHI 608E), with the MS and BR metal coupon as the
working electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and a platinum
wire as the counter electrode. EIS was performed at an open circuit
potential (OCP) using a 10 mV amplitude sinusoidal signal over frequencies
ranging from 5 mHz to 100 kHz. Polarization was determined at a scan
rate of 0.5 mV/s. Anodic and cathodic curves were obtained by scanning
from the OCP toward an OCP of +200 mV anodically and an OCP of −200
mV cathodically.49−51
