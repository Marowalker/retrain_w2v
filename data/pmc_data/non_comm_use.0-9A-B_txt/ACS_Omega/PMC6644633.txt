In the presence of
melamine and block copolymers, namely, F108,
F127, and P123, nitrogen-doped nanoporous carbon nanospheroids (N@CNSs)
were synthesized by the hydrothermal process. The F127-modified sample
(CNF127) exhibits the maximum Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area of 773.4 m2/g with a pore volume of
0.877 cm3/g. The microstructural study reveals that nanospheroids
of size 50–200 nm were aggregated together to form a chainlike
structure for all triblock copolymer-modified samples. The X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy study shows the binding energies of 398.33 and 400.7
eV attributed to sp2 (C–N=C)- and sp3 (C–N)-hybridized nitrogen-bonded carbons, respectively.
The synthesized N@CNS samples showed selective adsorption of organic
dye methylene blue (MB) in the presence of methyl orange (MO) as well
as Pb(II) ion removal from contaminated water. The adsorptions for
MB and Pb(II) ions followed pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order
kinetic models, respectively. The sample CNF127 showed the highest
adsorption of 73 and 99.82 mg/g for MB and Pb(II) adsorptions, respectively.
The adsorption capacity for MB of the copolymer-modified samples follows
the order CNF127 > CNP123 > CNF108, which corroborated with
the mesoporosity
as well as nitrogen content of the corresponding samples. The maximum
% adsorption of Pb(II) follows the order CNF127 (99.82%) > CNF108
(98.74%) > CNP123 (91.82%), and this trend is attributed to the
BET
surface area of the corresponding samples. This study demonstrates
multicomponent removal of water pollutants, both organic dyes and
inorganic toxic metal ions.

==== Body
Introduction
With
rapid industrial growth, water contamination by organic and
inorganic pollutants has become an important environmental concern
to living beings. Organic dyes are essential chemicals for a variety
of industries like textile, pulp and paper, paints, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals,
etc. The organic dyes are one of the major water pollutants causing
carcinogenic and teratogenic effects on human beings.1 There are various methods like ozone treatment, photocatalysis,
adsorption, ion exchange, electrochemical oxidation, etc. for the
removal of organic dyes. Among the different methods, adsorption is
the most effective method for dye degradation because of total removal
of the dye content without formation of any by-products.2 Among the inorganic pollutants, lead is found
to be a dreadful water pollutant causing detrimental effects on human
body like anemia, encephalopathy, hepatitis, nephritic syndrome, etc.3 Various industries like battery and chemical
manufacturing, petrochemicals, agrochemicals, etc. are the main sources
of Pb poisoning in waste water. Different processes like precipitation,
oxidation, ion exchange, filtration, reverse osmosis, electrodialysis,
adsorption, etc. are reported for the removal of lead ions from contaminated
water. Among the various processes, adsorption is the promising process
because of its high efficiency; effectiveness; and economical, versatile,
and simple operation for removing trace amounts of metal ions. Therefore,
it is important to fabricate such kind of adsorbents that have the
efficacy to remove both organic dyes and lead-containing inorganic
water pollutants simultaneously.

In recent time, nanoscience
and nanotechnology have significant
potential for remediation of environmental hazards. Different nanoadsorbents
such as activated carbon,4 layered double
hydroxide,5 zeolite,6 iron-based nanoadsorbents,7 etc.
have been widely used for decontamination of water. Meng et al. reported
a hybrid Si–C–N material for selective adsorption of
an organic dye.8 Poly(1-vinylimidazole)
ionic liquid-modified graphene showed high adsorption capacity for
methyl blue (MB).9

Porous carbon
and carbonaceous materials are popular adsorbents
for their large surface-to-volume ratio and high mechanical strength.
Recently, new-generation N-doped carbons have been found to be interesting
materials because of their superior physical and chemical properties
as compared to those of their undoped counterparts. Accordingly, a
wide range of applications are anticipated for these nitrogen-doped
carbon materials such as anodes in high-performance lithium ion batteries,10 high-performance supercapacitors,11 etc. A nitrogen-doped carbon material can provide
a large number of anchoring sites for adsorption of positive-charged
metal ions due to electronegativity difference between N and C atoms.12 Hence, it is necessary to develop and investigate
nitrogen-doped carbon materials as an adsorbent to be exploited for
removing toxic pollutants from water.

Nitrogen-doped carbon
materials have been used for the removal
of water contaminants. Recently, a N-doped carbon quantum dot–magnetite
nanocomposite was exploited for adsorption of methylene blue from
waste water.13 The N-doped carbon synthesized
from ionic liquid@ZIF 8 was used for the removal of herbicides from
water.14 Perez-Aguilar et al. reported
the adsorption of Cd and Pb by N-doped multiwall carbon nanotubes
prepared by the chemical vapor deposition process.15 Nitrogen-doped magnetic carbon nanoparticles have been
used for the removal of Cr3+ ions from water.16 For the removal of toxic metal ions from water,
N-doped carbon nanofibers were used.17 A
nitrogen-doped carbon xerogel was utilized for decontamination of
water by removing heavy metal ions.18

With the above motivation, the main goal of the present research
study is to synthesize highly porous nitrogen-doped carbon materials
prepared using melamine and triblock copolymers (TBCs) and investigation
of their performance as an adsorbent for the removal of both organic
dye, methylene blue (MB), and inorganic pollutant, lead (Pb), from
contaminated water. This study is significant for the fabrication
of a suitable adsorbent, which could be applicable for the removal
of multicomponent water pollutants, both organic dyes and inorganic
toxic metal ions.

Results and Discussion
Material Characteristics
Figure 1 shows the
Raman spectra of samples CNF108,
CNF127, and CNP123. The disorder structure of N-doped carbon materials
is confirmed by the appearance of peak at 1346 cm–1 (D band), whereas the band at 1596 cm–1 is due
to the sp2-hybridized C–C bond in-plane stretching
vibration (G band).19,20 The broad band appeared at around
2500–3000 cm–1 is considered as a G″
band, i.e., overtone of the D band induced by disorder.21 It is to be noted that there are no significant
changes in Raman bands of the three different samples, CNF108, CNF127,
and CNP123.

(N@CNS) samples.

Figure 2 shows the
N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of (a) CNF108,
(b) CNF127, and (c) CNP123, indicating a pseudo-type-1 isotherm. The
pore size distributions of the samples determined by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) method are shown in Figure 3, whereas the pore size distributions determined by
the density functional theory (DFT) method are revealed in the insets
of the corresponding figures. It is noticed that the mesopores generated
in the samples are in the range of 3–4 nm, whereas bi- or trimodal
distributions of micropores are observed for all of the samples. Table 1 depicts the surface
area, pore volume, and pore size data of CNF108, CNF127, and CNP123.
Interestingly, the sample CNF127 exhibits the highest Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area (773.4 m2/g) having a pore volume of
0.877 cm3/g. The total BET surface area comprises micropore
surface area (545.5 m2/g) and mesopore surface area (228
m2/g). The surface area follows the order CNF127 > CNF108
> CNP123. However, the pore volume of CNP123 is found to be higher
than that of CNF108, which is due to the presence of abundance mesoporosity
in the former sample, contributing the higher pore volume. The pore
size of all of the samples does not changed significantly.

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of the products
in full spectrum are shown in Figure 4a. This indicates the presence of C 1s, N 1s, and O
1s. The C 1s core level is deconvoluted into three subpeaks positioned
around the binding energies of 284.6, 285.1, and 287.8 eV (Figure 4b). It is found that
the position of the C 1s line assigning to the C–C bond is
shifted from 284.4 to 284.6 eV due to nitrogen doping. After deconvolution,
two additional peaks appear at around 285.1 and 287.87 eV. The sharp
peak with the binding energy of 285.1 eV is attributed to the sp2 C=N bonds, and the broad peak at 287.87 eV is attributed
to sp3 C–N bonds.22 The
high-resolution deconvoluted spectrum of N 1s is shown in Figure 4c–e for the
samples CNF108, CNF127, and CNP123, respectively. The deconvoluted
N 1s spectra render two distinguishable peaks with binding energies
of 398.33 and 400.7 eV. The peaks at 398.33 and 400.7 eV are attributed
to the pyridinic nitrogen or sp2-hybridized nitrogen (C–N=C)
and sp3-hybridized nitrogen (C–N), respectively.23−25 The above results confirm that in the nitrogen-doped carbon sample
(N@CNS), nitrogen interacts with carbon via double and single bonds
with sp2- and sp3-hybridized states, respectively.
It is worth noting that for different co-polymer-modified N@CNS samples,
the C 1s and N 1s peak positions remain unchanged. However, the atomic
% values of doped nitrogen obtained from XPS results were found to
be 4.05, 5.40, and 4.50 for the samples CNF108, CNF127, and CNP123,
respectively.

Microstructural features of the samples were studied by field
emission
scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (Figure 5) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
(Figure 6). Figure 5 reveals the FESEM
microstructures of the products CNF108, CNF127, and CNP123, and the
arrow marks represent the images with higher magnifications. The carbon
nanospheroids of size 50–200 nm were highly aggregated. The
high surface charge of the particles due to the polarity difference
between carbon and nitrogen atoms in N@CNS facilitates agglomeration
of the particles. The TEM images (Figure 6) show that the particles are arranged in
a chainlike fashion. The TEM images with a higher magnification reveal
the pores in the products. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS) analysis of the three samples reveals the presence of nitrogen
in nitrogen-doped carbon samples (N@CNS).

Dye Adsorption Study
Selective
Adsorption of Dye
To study the selective
adsorption capacity of the synthesized products, the cationic dye
MB and anionic dye methyl orange (MO) were used with an equal concentration
of 10 × 10–2 mM. Figure 7 shows the UV–vis spectral analysis
for the selective dye adsorption of MB and MO onto the samples. For
comparison, Figure S1, Supporting Information
(SI) shows the UV–vis spectrum of each dye MO and MB separately
for sample CNF127. To further investigate the selective removal of
the dyes having the same charge, the cationic dyes methylene blue
(MB) and methyl violet (MV) with a concentration of 5 × 10–2 mM each were used for sample CNF127. Figure S2, SI, shows (a) UV–vis spectral
analysis and (b) bar diagram (time vs adsorption %) of the adsorption
of two cationic dyes MB and MV for sample CNF127. This reveals that
adsorption % for MV is slightly higher than that of MB up to 40 min,
followed by their comparable adsorption for 50 min. However, after
60 min, adsorption % values for MB and MV were found to be 84 and
83.5%, respectively. It is worth noting that adsorption % for MB in
the presence of MV is slightly less than that in the presence of MO
because of competitive adsorption of both the cationic dyes in the
former dyes (MB and MV).

Figure 7 UV–vis spectral analysis for selective
dye adsorption for
N@CNS samples: (a) CNF108, (b) CNF127, and (c) CNP123.

The adsorption of MB onto the nitrogen-doped carbon
nanospheroids
(N@CNS) is due to electrostatic interaction between nitrogen lone
pairs in N@CNS and the cationic dye, MB. On the other hand, due to
the presence of electron cloud in both the anionic MO dye molecules
and N@CNS having sp2-hybridized nitrogen, the adsorption
of MO seldom occurs onto N@CNS. The molecular sizes of hydrated MB
and MO in aqueous solution are 11.226 and
26.14 Å,27 respectively. Therefore,
it is evident that the adsorption of MB is more facile than that of
MO due to the smaller size of the former dye. The adsorption capacity
for MB of the three samples follows the order CNF127 > CNP123 >
CNF108,
which corroborated with the mesoporosity of the corresponding samples
(Table 1). The maximum
nitrogen content in the CNF127 sample also contributed to the faster
adsorption of MB.

It was noticed that CNF127 shows a higher
adsorption capacity for
MB. The adsorption parameters like contact time, adsorbent (MB) concentration,
and temperature were varied for determining the adsorption capacity
of CNF127. Figure 8a,b shows the UV–vis spectral study and Ct/C0 vs time plot for the adsorption
of MB on CNF127, respectively. The adsorption of MB is high at the
initial stage of adsorption, and after that, the adsorption capacity
decreases with time. At the initial stage of adsorption, a large number
of adsorption sites are available in the adsorbent (CNF127), causing
the rapid adsorption of MB. The adsorption capability (qt) of the sample was calculated using eq 1, and the qt vs time plot is shown in Figure 8c. It shows that after 40 min of adsorption equilibrium
is reached, rendering about 98% adsorption.

Figure 8 (a) UV–vis spectral
study for MB adsorption with time for
CNF127, (b) Ct/C0 vs time plot, and (c) adsorption capacity vs time plot.

To understand the adsorption mechanisms,
the adsorption kinetics
of MB on CNF127 revealing the highest adsorption capacity was carried
out by employing three kinetic models. The experimental data were
fitted with pseudo-first-order (eq 1) and pseudo-second-order (eq 2) models. 1   2  where qe and qt (mg/g) are the amounts
of pollutants adsorbed
at equilibrium and at time t (min), respectively, k1 (min–1) is the Lagergren
pseudo-first-order and k2 (g/mg/min) is
the corresponding second-order rate constant, and t (min) is the contact time between the adsorbent and adsorbate. The
fitted plots for pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order models
are shown in Figures S3 and S4 (SI), respectively.
All of the experimental data obtained from fitted first-order and
second-order models is summarized in Table 2. The R2 (correlation
coefficient) values of 0.999 confirm that MB adsorption on CNF127
occurs with the pseudo-first-order kinetics model.

For a better perceptive of the adsorption
mechanism with diffusion,
the intraparticle diffusion model was examined by applying the Weber
and Morris equation 3  where kdi is the intraparticle rate constant (mg/g min1/2), t is the time (min), and Ci (mg/g)
is a constant related to the thickness of the boundary
layer. Figure S3 (SI) shows qt vs √t plots representing
trilinear regimes of three successive adsorption steps for MB. The
sharp rise in the 1st linear region of adsorption involves the instantaneous
adsorption where a high concentration of MB is the driving force of
diffusion. The second linear region relates relatively slow and steady
which is the rate-determining step attributing intraparticle diffusion
of MB onto the adsorbent pores.28 Finally,
due to the presence of low concentration of dye molecules, the intraparticle
diffusion rate decreases and an equilibrium stage is reached. All
of the experimental data obtained from the trilinear plot (Figure S5, SI) is summarized in Table 2.

To evaluate the adsorption
capacity, the adsorption isotherms are
obtained by varying the MB concentrations in solution. It was observed
that the amount of equilibrium adsorption (qe) increases with increasing equilibrium concentration (Ce) of MB up to 25 × 10–2 mM (Figure 9). The qe and Ce are fitted
with the two isotherm models (Langmuir and Freundlich) for understanding
the interaction between CNF127 and MB. Linear plots of Langmuir and
Freundlich isotherm models are revealed in Figure S6a,b, SI, respectively. The correlation coefficient (R2) obtained for the fitted plot of the Langmuir
isotherm (R2 = 0.999) is higher than that
for the Freundlich isotherm (R2 = 0.959).
This demonstrates that the Langmuir model is fitted satisfactorily,
implying the monolayer adsorption of dye molecules onto CNF127.29 According to the Langmuir model, the maximum
adsorption capacity of CNF127 for MB adsorption was found to be 73
mg/g.

Figure 9 Adsorption isotherm for different concentrations of MB for CNF127.

The adsorption capacity of MB
(5 × 10–2 mM)
in the presence of two electrolytes, namely, calcium nitrate and magnesium
nitrate with a concentration of 10 mg/L each, was studied (Figure S7, SI). This showed that about 1 and
10% adsorption occurred for calcium nitrate and magnesium nitrate,
respectively, whereas about 90% of MB was adsorbed on CNF127. The
electrolytes could not effect significantly to change the adsorption
of MB.

To evaluate the temperature effect on the adsorption
of MB, the
adsorption experiment was carried out with varying temperature keeping
the initial concentration of MB as 15 × 10–2 mM. Figure 10 shows
the bar diagram of MB adsorption, qt,
vs temperature. With an increase in temperature, MB adsorption increased.
This suggests that with an increase in temperature, diffusion of MB
through the external laminar layer into the pores of the sample increased,
resulting in an increase in the adsorption rate.30 The CNF127 sample shows the maximum adsorption for MB (94.93
mg/g) at 338 K.

Figure 10 MB adsorption with temperature for CNF127.

The thermodynamic parameters such as Gibbs free
energy change (ΔG°), enthalpy change (ΔH°),
and entropy change (ΔS°) were calculated
using the following equation 4   5   6  where K is the thermodynamic
equilibrium constant, R is the universal gas constant
(8.314 J/mol/K), and T is the temperature (K). The
values of ΔH° and ΔS° are obtained from the slope and intercept of the plot of ln Kd vs 1/T, respectively (Figure S8, SI). The values of ΔG°, ΔH°, and ΔS° for the adsorption process at 25 °C (298 K)
are shown in Table 3. The negative ΔG° value signifies that
MB adsorption by CNF127 is spontaneous. The adsorption process is
exothermic as indicated by the negative ΔH°
value, and positive ΔS° value signifies
the increases in randomness at the solid–liquid interface during
adsorption.31

MB Adsorption by CNF127

–20.632

–26.705 at 338 K	
To examine the suitability of the sample CNF127
for the removal
of MB in municipality water (real matrix), the adsorption experiment
is further carried out in municipality water samples. The simulation
experiments were performed in municipality water system with different
initial concentrations of MB (10 × 10–2, 15
× 10–2 and 25 × 10–2 mM). The adsorption capacity (mg/g) of CNF127 for MB in municipality
water and deionized water was found to be comparable (Figure S9, SI).

Adsorption of Pb(II) Ions
The synthesized samples (CNF108,
CNF127, and CNP123) also have the significant potential for removing
Pb(II) ions (hydrated radius of Pb(II): 2.61 Å32) from waste water. To study the adsorption capacity toward
Pb(II) ions removal, 5 mg of sample was utilized for 50 ppm Pb(II)
ion adsorption at different time intervals. Figure 11 shows that within 5 min the adsorption
of Pb(II) ions took place rapidly, showing the adsorption capacities
of 62.5, 91.4, and 71.7 mg/g for samples CNF108, CNF127, and CNP123,
respectively. This indicates that a large number of active adsorption
sites are available at the first stage. After that, the adsorption
of Pb(II) ions continues slowly, achieving maximum adsorption at 120
min. The maximum % adsorption of Pb(II) followed in the order of CNF127
(99.82%) > CNF108 (98.74%) > CNP123 (91.82%); this trend corroborates
with the BET surface area of the corresponding samples. It is clear
that with a higher BET surface area of CNF127, the available active
adsorption sites are abundant, leading to the higher rate of Pb(II)
ion adsorption. Figures S10 and S11, SI,
show pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetic models. The
parameters qt, k1, k2, and R2 are summarized in Table S1, SI.
For all of the samples, pseudo-second-order kinetics is a well-fitted
model, as shown by the R2 values (Table S1, SI). This indicates that the chemisorption
process is the rate-determining step.

Figure 11 C/C0 vs time plot
for Pb(II) adsorption by N@CNS.

To evaluate the adsorption capacity for Pb(II) ions in the
presence
of different electrolytes, the experiment was carried out in the presence
of Ca(NO3)2 and Mg(NO3)2. Figure S12, SI, shows (a) adsorption
of Pb(II) ions in the absence and presence of Ca(II) and Mg(II) ions
and (b) relative adsorption of Pb(II) ions in the presence of Ca(II)
and Mg(II) ions. This shows that in the presence of Ca(II) and Mg(II)
ions the adsorption % of Pb(II) ions decreased as about 8, 10, and
11% for the samples CNF127, CNF108, and CNP123, respectively. However,
in the presence of Ca(II) and Mg(II) ions, the adsorption of Pb(II)
ions was 92, 88.9, and 80.3% for CNF127, CNF108 and CNP123, respectively.
The adsorption capacity of the multicomponent metal ions followed
the trend Pb(II) > Mg(II) > Ca(II), which is related to their
electronegativity
values33 (Pauling’s scale) (Pb(II)
(2.33) > Mg(II) (1.31) > Ca(II) (1.00)). In N@CNS, the sp2-hybridized nitrogen having a lone pair electron as well as
delocalized
π electron facilitates more Pb(II) ion adsorption due to its
higher electronegativity compared to that of Mg(II) and Ca(II) ions.

The proposed adsorption mechanism is shown in Figure 12. The adsorption of pollutants
(MB dye and Pb(II) ion) onto the surface of N@CNS samples could be
governed by the electrostatic interactions. On the basis of the XPS
study, it is clear that nitrogen in N@CNS is in sp2-hybridized
as well as sp3-hybridized states. In the sp2-hybridized state of nitrogen in N@CNS, both the lone pair electron
in nitrogen and delocalized π electrons in the N=C bond
electrostatically interact with cationic dye MB. It is worth noting
that the presence of sp2-hybridized carbon in hybrid Si–C–N8 and poly(1-vinylimidazole) ionic liquid-modified
graphene9 exhibit a higher adsorption capacity
for MB. For adsorption of Pb(II) ions, it is understood that in N@CNS
the sp2-hybridized nitrogen having a lone pair electron
as well as delocalized π electrons could be available to donate
the vacant 6p orbital of Pb(II) ions. Thus, the positively charged
dye, MB, and Pb(II) ions were readily adsorbed onto N@CNS via electrostatic
attractions. With increasing N sites of N@CNS samples, the adsorption
capacity increases. Accordingly, the sample CNF127 having a higher
amount of N content (5.4 atom %) renders maximum adsorption for both
MB dye and Pb(II) ions. On the other hand, the anionic dye, MO, could
not be adsorbed onto the N@CNS samples due to the presence of electron
cloud in both the anionic MO dye molecules and N@CNS. It is inferred
that the synthesized nitrogen-doped carbon nanospheroids (N@CNS) could
be used for selective adsorption of organic dye and positively charged
cations from contaminated water.

by N@CNS samples.

Conclusions
In summary, nitrogen-doped nanoporous carbon nanospheroids were
prepared using various block copolymers and melamine. The synthesized
products contain both micropores and mesopores, and the BET surface
area follows the order CNF127 > CNF108 > CNP123 for F127-, F108-,
and P123-modified samples, respectively. The microstructural study
confirms agglomerated nanospheroids due to the presence of their high
surface charge. The XPS study confirms that N atoms in nitrogen-doped
carbon are in sp2-hybridized as well as sp3-hybridized
states. In the sp2-hybridized state of nitrogen in the
product, both the lone pair electron in nitrogen and delocalized π
electrons in C–N=C electrostatically interact with cationic
dye MB, rendering its selective adsorption in the presence of anionic
dye MO. For MB adsorption, the adsorption capacity follows the order
CNF127 > CNP123 > CNF108, which corroborates with the N content
in
the respective samples. Similarly, Pb(II) adsorption is facilitated
because the sp2-hybridized nitrogen having a lone pair
electron as well as delocalized π electrons in nitrogen-doped
carbon could be available to donate the vacant 6p orbital of Pb(II)
ions. The maximum % of Pb(II) adsorption followed in the order CNF127
(99.82%) > CNF108 (98.74%) > CNP123 (91.82%); this trend corroborates
with the BET surface area of the corresponding samples. The present
work is significant for designing the synthesis of nitrogen-doped
carbon nanospheroids for the removal of different cationic organic
dyes and toxic metals from waste water via an environmentally friendly
process.

Experimental Section
Materials
Merck, India (formaldehyde,
phenol, methylene
blue (MB), methyl orange (MO), methyl violet (MV), magnesium nitrate,
calcium nitrate, lead nitrate, and sodium hydroxide) and Sigma-Aldrich
(melamine and triblock copolymers) products were used.

Procedure
Phenol (600 mg) was added into a mix solution
of formaldehyde (2.1 mL) and NaOH (15 mL 0.1 M) under stirring at
70 °C/30 min. F108, F127, and P123 (0.07 mmol, 15 mL) each was
poured separately to the former solution. After stirring for 2 h,
2.66 g of melamine in water (50 mL) was added. Stirring was continued
for 15–18 h. Deionized water (56 mL) was added into 18 mL of
prepared solution each, and it was treated hydrothermally at 130 °C/24
h. The hydrothermally synthesized products were heated in a tube furnace
by flowing N2 (40 mL/min) at 700 °C/3 h. The sample
IDs of synthesized nitrogen-doped carbon nanospheroids (N@CNS) were
CNF108, CNF127, and CNP123 for the different copolymers F108, F127,
and P123, respectively. Scheme 1 shows a tentative formation mechanism for the preparation
of N-doped porous carbon nanospheroids. During synthesis, formaldehyde
reacts with phenol in alkaline medium to form polymeric resol (water-soluble
phenolic resin). In the presence of triblock copolymers (TBC, F127/F108/P123),
resol and melamine form micelles in which the TBC interacts with the
hydroxyl groups of resol and amino groups of melamine through hydrogen
bonding. Under hydrothermal conditions at 130 °C/24 h, resol-TBC-melamine
micelles self-assembled to form a yellowish product. After calcinations
at 700 °C/3 h in a N2 atmosphere, templated TBC and
organic moieties are removed from the hydrothermally synthesized product,
forming porous N@CNS particles.

Scheme 1 Schematic Representation for the Formation
of N@CNS
The synthesized products
were characterized by Raman spectroscopy
(Renishaw spectrometer, 514 nm Ar laser), N2 adsorption–desorption
measurements (Quantachrome ASIQ MP), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(ULVAC-PHI), FESEM (Zeiss, Supra 35VP, Oberkochen, Germany), and TEM
(Tecnai G2 30ST, FEI). UV–visible spectroscopy was performed
by a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Jasco V-730).

Adsorption
Experiment
The prepared sample (5 mg, N@CNS)
was added into 10 mL solutions of MB with different initial concentrations
in the range of 5 × 10–2 to 25 × 10–2 mM. After the specified time, the adsorbent was filtered
and MB concentration in the solution was measured by a UV–vis
spectrophotometer. The amount of MB removed by the samples, qt (mg/g), was calculated using the following
equation 7  where qt (mg)
is the amount of MB adsorbed per gm of adsorbent at time t, C0 (at initial time) and Ct (at time t) are the MB concentrations,
and V (mL) and m (gm) are the adsorbent
volume and adsorbent mass, respectively.

For kinetic study,
5 × 10–2 mM MB (10 mL) was mixed with 5 mg
of N@CNS samples under stirring for different times. At a desired
time interval, the concentration of MB in the solution was measured
by a UV–vis spectrophotometer. Pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order,
and intraparticle diffusion models were used to fit the kinetic data.

To determine the surface properties of the adsorbent and interactions
between the adsorbent and adsorbate, adsorption data were fitted with
Langmuir and Freundlich models. The Langmuir equation is expressed
as 8  The linear form of the Langmuir isotherm is
represented as 9  Here, qe (mg/g)
represents the amount of adsorbed MB (mg) per gm of N@CNS samples, qm (mg/g) is the equilibrium adsorption capacity
(maximum), Ce (mg/L) is the MB left unadsorbed
at equilibrium, and KL is the adsorption
constant. By plotting Ce/qe vs Ce, qm and KL can be known from
the slope and intercept, respectively.

Freundlich isotherm is
expressed as 10  where KF and nF are the measures of adsorption capacity and
adsorption intensity, respectively, and KF and 1/nF are known from the intercept
and slope of the log Ce vs log qe graph, respectively.

The adsorption
experiment for Pb(II) was studied by adding 5 mg
of samples into 10 mL of 50 ppm Pb(II) ion solution (Pb(II) concentrations
were measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy
at different time intervals).
