Scintillator materials are used as
detectors in the ray imaging
techniques for medical diagnosis. Because the ideal medical scintillator
material does not exist, many efforts are being made to find new materials
that satisfy a greater number of properties. Here, the synthesis conditions
of Pr:KGd(PO3)4 nanocrystals by the modified
Pechini method are optimized to obtain a single crystalline phase
of those that form the polymorphism of KGd(PO3)4. The interest lies in the type III phase because less quenching
by Pr3+ concentration is expected. By performing transmittance
measurements and because of the wide transparency window of the type
III KGd(PO3)4 host, the 3H4 → 5d1 absorption transition of Pr3+ has been observed in the vacuum ultraviolet spectral range. After
creating electron–hole pairs in the host due to the excitation
of the material by X-ray radiation, the bands corresponding to the
5d1 → 3H4, 3H5, 3H6 and 5d1 → 3F3, 3F4, 1G4 transitions of Pr3+ have been observed in the
near-visible spectral range, being these 5d → 4f transitions
interesting for scintillation applications. Therefore, the type III
Pr:KGd(PO3)4 nanocrystals allow the conversion
from high-energy radiation to visible or near-visible light.

1 Introduction
Potassium gadolinium phosphate,
KGd(PO3)4, hereafter KGdP, is a monoclinic crystal
that belongs to the wide
family of condensed phosphates of double phosphates of alkali (M)
and lanthanide (Ln) ions with the general formula MILnIII(PO3)4. These condensed phosphates
are constituted by corner-sharing PO4 tetrahedra with variable
O/P ratio (from 2.5 to 4) building phosphoric anions. Because of the
different possibilities of condensation of the phosphoric anions (long
chains, rings, and also three-dimensional networks), the condensed
phosphates present multiple crystalline structures; so, KGdP can crystallize
in three different crystalline structures: type III phase (space group: P21), type IV (space group: P21/n), and type B phase (space group: C2/c).1 The
first two crystalline structures present long chains of polyphosphates,
while the third crystalline structure belongs to the group of cyclophosphates,
in which the PO4 forms rings. Besides this structural feature,
the coordination of the cations presents differences among these three
different crystalline phases.

KGdP can be easily doped with
other lanthanide ions, such as praseodymium
(Pr3+), because gadolinium (Gd3+) has a high
capacity for substitution with lanthanides ions due to the proximity
of the ionic radii and the common valence with the other lanthanides
ions1 (ionic radii of Gd3+ and
Pr3+ with coordination VIII are 1.053 and 1.126 Å,
respectively2). Besides, KPr(PO3)4 and KGdP crystals are isostructural (in the polyphosphate
form, with type III phase,3 and in the
cyclophosphate form, with the type B phase4). To our knowledge, there is no evidence of the existence of the
KPr(PO3)4 with the type IV crystalline structure.

The transparency window of KGdP extends from 160 nm to 4 μm,5 which covers the main absorption and emission
wavelengths of praseodymium. This UV transparency is a great advantage
of this compound to be used as a scintillator material based on the
d–f electronic transitions of Pr3+ as the doping
ion. Scintillator materials are extensively used in technological,
industrial, and medical applications.6 One
of its main applications is as a detector in the ray imaging techniques
for medical diagnosis.7−9 In general, an ideal medical scintillator should
satisfy the following eight properties to be considered a good scintillator:
short decay time, high luminous efficacy, no afterglow, short radiation
length, high density, low cost, good spectral match to photodetectors,
and high light yield.10,11 However, until the time, the
ideal scintillator does not exist, so each modality of medical imaging
systems must select the most suitable combination of properties from
the existing scintillators. For this reason, many efforts are being
made to find the ideal one. Scintillators can be synthesized in different
forms, such as single crystals, powder, thin films, and nanoparticles.
Single-crystal sodium iodide doped with thallium ions (NaI (Tl)) is
a conventional medical scintillator; however, it does not satisfy
with some of the requirements. NaI (Tl) has a comparatively long decay
time and a low density.10 Because the parity
allowed f–d transitions in lanthanide ion-doped materials present
high oscillator strengths and the 5d levels have short lifetimes (typically
ns), the lanthanide ion-doped materials are an interesting alternative
for scintillator materials.6 García-Murillo
et al.12 proposed europium-doped Gd2O3 thin films as a possible good scintillator because
of its middle light yield; nevertheless, later this type of films
were not considered good as a scintillator for medical imaging because
of its comparatively high afterglow. Pedrini et al.13 studied praseodymium-doped YAlO3, and they found
that this material has fast UV fluorescence because of the allowed
d–f transitions of Pr3+ but relatively low scintillation
efficiency. Thus, praseodymium-doped KGdP crystals could be a novel
alternative as a scintillator material because the photoluminescence
generated by Pr3+ ions, after absorbing high-energetic
photons by the crystal, in the visible and UV spectral regions through
the 5d1 → 3H4 transition can
be observed because of the low UV transparency cut-off of this material.

Moreover, nanocrystalline form allows the possibility to further
prepare ceramic materials because of the larger activity in sintering
from the nanoscale size14−16 and also the almost isometric
nature of the KGdP structure. In this work, the Pechini method has
been used to synthesize KGdP nanocrystals, which previously was successfully
used to prepare KNP nanocrystals.17 This
method yields inorganic oxides of excellent phase purity and well-controlled
stoichiometry. It also allows obtaining ceramic powders with fine
grain size at relatively low temperature through the formation of
a polymeric organic net between a metallic acid chelate and a polyhydroxide
alcohol by polyesterification. The polymeric network retains homogeneity
on the atomic scale and reduces any segregation of the cations. Furthermore,
the Pechini method allows to reach various compositions and to vary
the nature and the concentration of the doping ion easily.18−22

Thus, the first aim of this work is the optimization of the
synthesis
conditions of type III KGdP nanocrystals doped with praseodymium by
the modified Pechini method in order to obtain the nanocrystals in
a single crystalline phase. The next goals are to achieve its physical
characterization and then its optical spectroscopy to determine whether
this material could be a new scintillator material.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Synthesis of the Nanocrystals
A schematic
diagram of the modified Pechini synthesis process used for the preparation
of Pr:KGdP nanocrystals is shown in Scheme 1, and an illustration of the basic chemical
reactions of the Pechini process19,23 is shown in Scheme 2.

Basic Chemical Reactions Involved in the Preparation
of the Organic Precursor in the Modified Pechini Method
Powders of Pr6O11 (Aldrich Chemical Company
Inc., 99.9%), Gd2O3 (Aldrich, 99.9%), NH4H2PO4 (Fluka Analytical, ≥99.0%),
(NH4)2HPO4 (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥98%),
and K2CO3 anhydrous (Alfa Aesar, A Johnson Matthey
Company, 99%) were used as starting materials. At first, stoichiometric
amounts of Pr6O11 and Gd2O3 are converted to the lanthanide nitrate into a quartz crucible by
dissolution in concentrated HNO3 (Merck, 65%) and heated
at about 423 K under stirring to evaporate the liquid part. At the
same time, stoichiometric amounts of K2CO3 and
NH4H2PO4 or (NH4)2HPO4 are dissolved in distilled water into a glass
beaker at 323 K.

After that, citric acid, CA, is added as a
chelating agent to each
container in a specific molar ratio (CM = [CA]/[METAL]) to prepare metal-chelated CA. CM describes the degree of the chelation process of the
metal in the organic product.21 To give
rise to good reaction between the metal cations and CA, each container
is heated at 348 K for 10–20 h under stirring and covered with
a crystallizer. On the contrary to other modified Pechini methods
used, in this case, we had to use two different containers to avoid
the precipitation of gadolinium phosphate.24 The quartz crucible with gadolinium and praseodymium nitrates is
named container 1 and the glass beaker with K2CO3 and the phosphate precursor, NH4H2PO4 or (NH4)2PO4, is named container
2. Just after the incorporation of the CA, the pH in the chelation
reaction in container 1 is 1 (pH1 = 1); it is 2 in container
2 with NH4H2PO4 as the phosphate
precursor (pH2 = 2); and the pH in container 2 with (NH4)2PO4 as precursor is 3 (pH2 = 3). Then, in order to study the effect of pH change in the chelation
reaction in container 2, the pH2 was varied by adding NH4OH just after the incorporation of the CA in Exp. 8, and afterward,
the result from this experiment was compared with others.

Then,
the content of the two containers are joined in the quartz
crucible and they are mixed at 373 K for 4 h under stirring and covered
with a crystallizer.

Afterward, ethylene glycol, EG, is added
as an esterification agent
in a specific molar ratio (CE = [CA]/[EG])
in order to obtain the polymeric resin. CE describes the degree of esterification between the hydroxyl groups
of EG and the carboxylic acid groups of CA.21 For this purpose, the reagents are heated at 473 K in a sand bath
without being covered and under stirring for 3–4 h. During
this step, the viscosity of the product resin gradually increases
until the resin gels;22 at this time, the
stirrer is removed. To obtain a drier resin, it is heated at the same
temperature of 473 K for a 20 h. This reaction is considered finished
when a whitish gel is observed at the bottom of the crucible.

The following step is an initial calcination at 573 K for several
hours to start the decomposition of the resin. Thereafter, a product
of spongy texture of shiny black color is obtained. To end, this product
is grinded in an agate mortar and the resulting precursor powder is
calcined at different temperatures in the range from 673 to 1073 K
and at air atmosphere for several hours. After each calcination, the
resulting powder is grinded in an agate mortar to promote easier removal
of the organic parts. These calcinations were performed in a vertical
muffle controlled by an Eurotherm temperature controller/programmer.

2.2 Characterization Techniques
The crystalline
phases of the nanocrystals were identified by X-ray powder diffraction
using a Siemens D5000 diffractometer with a Bragg–Brentano
parafocusing geometry and vertical θ–θ goniometer,
fitted with a curved graphite diffracted-beam monochromator, incident
and diffracted-beam Soller slits, a 0.06° receiving slit, and
a scintillation counter as a detector. Cu Kα radiation was obtained
from a copper X-ray tube operated at 40 kV and 30 mA. For conventional
analysis, the X-ray powder diffraction patterns were collected from
5 to 70° of 2θ diffraction range with a step size (ss)
of 0.05°, a step time (st) equal to 3 s, and sample rotation.
For obtaining diffractograms with lower background noise and thus
to be able to identify better the presence of undesirable phases or
compounds, the data were collected in a 2θ diffraction range
from 10 to 60° with a ss of 0.03°, a st equal to 7 s, and
sample rotation. The unit cell parameters of the non-centrosymmetric
phase were calculated using the Rietveld method.25

The chemical composition of the nanocrystals was
measured quantitatively by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) using
a JEOL JXA-8230 electron microprobe. Before taking the measurements,
the samples were prepared in tablet form and one of the two flat faces
was sputtered with carbon, which acts as a conductor media to avoid
the overcharge of the samples. The electron beam was generated at
an intensity of 15 nA and an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. The concentrations
of K, P, and O were determined using the Kα X-ray lines of K,
P, and O, respectively, and the concentrations of Pr and Gd using
the Lα X-ray lines of these elements. The measurement time for
Pr was 60 s, while for the other elements was 10 s. In the case of
Pr, the measurement time was higher because of its low atomic concentration
in the KGdP host.

Differential thermal analysis (DTA) was used
to study the thermal
evolution of the nanocrystals with the temperature by using a TA Instruments
SDT 2960 simultaneous differential scanning calorimetry–thermogravimetric
analysis system. The heating rate was at 10 K/min with an air flux
of 90 cm3/min and the Al2O3 was used
as a reference.

The morphology, size distribution, and homogeneity
of the nanocrystals
were observed using a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) JEOL
JEM-1011 system with a MegaView III (Soft Imaging System). Previous
to the observation of the nanocrystals by TEM, the samples were mixed
with ethanol and subsequently were placed in an ultrasound bath for
50 min to reduce and disperse the agglomerates. The TEM images were
observed using an accelerating voltage of 80 and 100 kV.

The
optical absorption of the praseodymium ion in KGdP nanocrystals
was studied by transmittance measurements at room temperature using
a Cary 5000 UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer. The optical
absorption spectrum at room temperature of a plate of undoped KGdP
single crystal was also obtained in order to help us to label the
electronic transitions belonging to praseodymium, using the same apparatus.
The undoped KGdP single crystal was grown by the top seeded solution
growth—slow cooling technique as reported in Parreu et al.26

The emission spectra at room temperature
of the Pr:KGdP nanocrystals
under 445 nm excitation were obtained using a Cary Eclipse fluorescence
spectrophotometer with a xenon lamp as the excitation source. The
emission spectra at room temperature under X-ray excitation were performed
using an X-ray tube with a copper target operating at 40 kV and 30
mA, available at Servei de Recursos Científics i Tècnics
of the Universitat Rovira i Virgili. The X-ray radiation reached the
pellet sample with an incident angle of 63° with respect to the
pellet sample plane. The luminescence emitted from the sample was
collected at 90° with respect to the pellet plane, focused with
an UV fused silica biconvex lens, guided with an optical fiber, and
detected by an Ocean Optics FLAME-S-UV-VIS-ES spectrometer with a
spectral resolution of ∼1.5 nm.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Synthesis of KGdP Nanocrystals
Tables 1 and 2 show a summary of the experimental parameters used
in the
synthesis experiments and the phases obtained. The column entitled
as “proportion of phases” refers to the ratio qualitatively
estimated between the following two crystalline phases of KGdP: type
III (monoclinic, space group: P21) and
type B phase (monoclinic, space group: C2/c). The number of > or < symbols is related to the
proportion
between these two phases. Thus, P21 > C2/c means that the intensity of the X-ray
diffraction peaks of the P21 phase is
only slightly higher than the corresponding to the C2/c phase, while P21 ≫≫> C2/c means
that
the P21 is clearly the majority phase
and the C2/c is a very minority
phase. The column called “presence of other compounds”
indicates the presence in the sample of compounds different from the
KGdP type III and type B phases. Our interest lies in obtaining solely
the type III phase (space group: P21)
because the minor Gd–Gd interatomic distance in this crystalline
phase is the longest one in comparison to the other two phases of
KGdP (type IV and type B phases), resulting in a priori minor occurrence
of the quenching by Ln3+ concentration in the process of
emitting light by the optically active lanthanide ions (Ln3+). The minor Gd–Gd interatomic distance is 6.59,27 6.316,28 and 5.269
Å29 for the type III, type IV and
type B phases of KGdP, respectively. Besides, given that the average
Gd–O interatomic distance into the Gd coordination polyhedron
and its distortion are similar in the three crystalline phases,27 the Ln3+ ions will experience similar
interactions with the crystal field.30 In
addition, a distinctive feature of the type III phase is that it is
a non-centrosymmetric crystalline phase, which allows it to have nonlinear
optical properties. Figure 1 shows a projection of the type III KGdP crystalline structure
parallel to the b crystallographic direction, in
which the Gd coordination polyhedron and the shortest Gd–Gd
interatomic distance can be observed.

d In all cases, CM = 3, pH1 = 1, CE =
2, and a first calcination at 573 K for 10 h.

The experimental parameters of the first experiment
were as follows:
an atomic percentage of praseodymium doping ions of 1 at. %, CM = 3, CE = 2, a
first calcination at 573 K for 3 h, and a second one at 1073 K for
3 h. As it can be observed in Figure 2, the obtained product in Exp. 1 corresponds to a mixture
of Gd2O3·2P2O5 (JCPDS
35-0078), KPO3 (JCPDS 35-0819), which have been identified
as intermediate products, and KGdP (P21 phase). To provoke the complete synthesis of KGdP as a product and
eliminate the presence of other compounds in the final product, the
reaction times between the reactants in the chelating, esterification,
and polymerization reactions (Scheme 2) under stirring were longer than in Exp. 1 and the
time in the two calcinations was also elongated (Exp. 2, 3). The effect
of the molar ratios CM and CE was also studied (Exp. 3–6). Almost in all these
experiments, only KGdP product was obtained and its C2/c phase was in a higher proportion than the P21 phase, as can be seen in Figure 2. Because there is an overlap
of many peaks of the type IV phase pattern with the patterns of the
type III and B phases, it is difficult to affirm or discard the presence
of a low amount of the type IV phase (monoclinic, space group: P21/n) in these experiments.
The ratio of the two majoritarian crystalline phases of KGdP is reverted
in Exp. 6 when CM = 3 and CE = 2 are used. Thus, CM =
3 and CE = 2 seem to be the most suitable
molar ratios for obtaining mainly the non-centrosymmetric crystalline
phase of KGdP (space group: P21). From
now on, all synthesis experiments were performed using these two molar
ratios and a first calcination at 573 K for 10 h.

KGdP and one experimental diffractogram of Pr:KGdP nanocrystals for
each experiment from Exp. 1 to Exp. 6.

By comparing Exp. 6, 7, and 8, the effect of the pH change
in the
chelation reaction can be observed. As explained in the Experimental Section, when NH4H2PO4 was used as the phosphate precursor (Exp. 6), the pH in this
reaction was about pH2 = 2. In order to have the reaction
in a less acid medium, ammonium phosphate dibasic, (NH4)2HPO4, was used as a source of phosphate groups,
leading to an at least pH2 = 3 during this reaction in
Exp. 7. Finally, in Exp. 8, ammonium hydroxide, NH4OH,
was added just after the incorporation of CA in order to obtain a
pH2 = 5. First, it should be noted that the carboxylate
ion functions effectively to form metal chelates, whereas the non-ionized
carboxylic acid group is not an efficient donor group.31 The concentration of the carboxylate ion is
higher than the one of non-ionized carboxylic acid group when pH >
pKa.32 Thus,
because the logarithmic acid dissociation constant of the first proton
of CA is pKa1 = 3.13 and of the second
one is pKa2 = 4.76, CA is found with one
carboxylate ion when pH is in the range 3.13–4.75 and with
two carboxylate ions when pH is between 4.76 and 6.39.33 Besides, it should also be noted that the esterification
reaction needs to be catalyzed by acid and the non-ionized carboxylic
acid group is required in order to have the carbonyl activated toward
nucleophilic attack. Thus, a pH2 of at least 3 seems to
be the most suitable pH because pH2 = 3.13–4.75
results in a molecule of CA with one carboxylate ion to prepare one
metal–CA chelate and with two non-ionized carboxylic acid groups
to give rise to the esterification reaction in order to obtain the
polymeric organic network. This homogeneous formation of the polymeric
network could contribute to obtain a single crystalline phase of KGdP,
as it can be observed in Figure 3. Then, the conditions of Exp. 7 are more appropriate
to form type III KGdP than the ones for Exp. 6 and 8.

pattern for two crystalline phases of
KGdP and one experimental diffractogram of Pr:KGdP nanocrystals for
each experiment from Exp. 7 to Exp. 12. The diffractograms 9b, 10,
11, and 12 belong to X-ray powder diffraction analysis with ss = 0.03°
and st = 7 s.

By changing the calcination
time, calcination temperature, and
number of calcinations, the product obtained presents different ratios
of the P21 and C2/c crystalline phases and different quantity of subproducts.
In the Exp. 7, it is observed by these changes in the calcination
procedure than a lower temperature in the calcination 2, and the addition
of a third calcination favors the obtaining of the P21 crystalline phase and the reduction of the presence
of other phases in the final product. In the Exp. 9, 10, 11, and 12,
besides change in the concentration of praseodymium of the obtained
product, the temperatures and times of calcination 2 and calcination
3 were optimized till obtaining no presence of other compounds and
only obtaining the P21 crystalline KGdP
phase in the product. Thus, summarizing, the optimal conditions of
calcination are a first calcination at 573 K for 10 h, a second calcination
at 773 K for 10 h, and a third calcination at 873 K for 7 h.

Thus summarizing, the optimal parameters to synthesize KGd1–xPrx(PO3)4 nanocrystals with a unique crystalline P21 phase by the modified Pechini method are CM = 1 with a pH2 = 3, CE = 2, a reaction time between metal cations and CA of
10–20 h at 348 K under stirring (when the reagents are in two
separate containers) followed by 4 h more at 373 K after mixing the
content of the containers, a reaction time between metal–CA
complexes and EG of around 4 h at 473 K in a sand bath under stirring
followed by about 20 h more at the same temperature without stirring,
a first calcination at 573 K for 10 h, a second one at 773 K for 10
h, and a third one at 873 K for 7 h.

3.2 Morphological
Characterization and Particle
Size Distribution
The morphology, size distribution, and
homogeneity of the nanocrystals were observed by TEM. The particle
size distribution was estimated using multiple TEM images as the pictures
shown in Figure 4.
In the same figure, the histogram of the particle size distribution
of 5 at. % Pr:KGdP nanocrystals is also shown. From the histogram,
a predominance of small particles with sizes ranging from 10 to 20
nm can be observed. The distribution of the particle size can be fitted
by a lognormal function, as expected in particles prepared by the
Pechini method, in which their constitution follows the steps of nucleation,
condensation, and crystal particle growth.34,35

Exp. 10 and the total particle size distribution.

3.3 Effects of Doping: Changes in Unit Cell Parameters
with Praseodymium Doping
The unit cell parameters and unit
cell volume of Pr:KGdP nanocrystals were refined by the Rietveld method.25Figure 5 shows the observed, calculated and differential X-ray powder
diffraction profile obtained after Rietveld refinement of the 10 at.
% Pr:KGdP nanocrystals, as an example. In Table 3, it can be seen how as the praseodymium
content increases, the a, b, and c unit cell parameters and the unit cell volume V increase. However, the increase of the a unit cell parameter is very slight. This increase in the unit cell
volume when Pr3+ is introduced as the doping ion in the
KGdP structure was expected because the ionic radius of Pr3+ is higher than that of Gd3+ (ionic radii of Gd3+ and Pr3+ with coordination VIII are 1.053 and 1.126 Å,
respectively2).

The atomic percentage of praseodymium with respect
to gadolinium
obtained by EPMA for the sample labeled as 3 at. % Pr:KGdP was 2.8
at. %, for 5 at. % Pr:KGdP was 4.9 at. %, and 8.9 at. % for the sample
labeled as 10 at. % Pr:KGdP. The sample labeled as 1 at. % Pr:KGdP
was not measured by EPMA because the amount of praseodymium is quite
low; however, its atomic percentage with respect to gadolinium is
expected to be similar to 1 at. %.

3.4 Thermal
Analysis of the Nanocrystals
Figure 6 shows the
DTA thermogram of type III 0, 5, and 10 at. % Pr:KGdP nanocrystals.
By DTA of type III KGdP nanocrystals and considering a previous study26 about how type III KGdP single crystal evolves
with temperature between room temperature and 1273 K using DTA and
X-ray powder diffraction, it was determined that type III KGdP nanocrystals
melt incongruently at 1121 K. The incongruent melting point of type
III KGdP single crystal is 1142 K, as reported in ref (26). Because the first ones
are nanocrystals, a decrease of its incongruent melting point in relation
to the bulk material was already expected, given that a higher surface
to volume ratio results in a lower melting temperature.36,37 From the same Figure 6, it could be observed that as praseodymium content in the nanocrystals
increases, the incongruent melting point slightly decreases.

3.5 Optical Spectroscopy of
Pr3+ in
Pr:KGdP Nanocrystals
Figure 7a shows the transmittance spectra at room temperature
of type III 5 at. % Pr:KGdP nanocrystals suspended in distilled water.
In order to help us identify the absorption peaks observed in the
transmittance spectra, the information obtained from the optical absorption
spectrum at room temperature of a plate of undoped KGdP single crystal
from 190 to 320 nm (Figure 7b) was used. In Figure 7b, by using the Dieke’s diagram,38,39 all the 4f → 4f electronic transitions of Gd3+ at wavelengths higher than 190 nm have been labeled. No other absorption
belonging to Gd3+ can be observed at longer wavelengths
than at 320 nm.

nanocrystals

spectrum of a plate of undoped KGdP single crystal at room temperature.
In green, the labels corresponding to the electronic transitions of
Pr3+ assigned to each observed band, and in purple, those
corresponding to the electronic transitions of Gd3+.

In Figure 7a, a
broad and intense band centered at 218 nm and two small peaks centered
at 445 and 482 nm can be seen. With regard to the intense broad band,
it has been proposed that it belongs to the 3H4 → 5d1 transition of Pr3+ because an
absorption transition of Gd3+ is not expected in this wavelength,
as seen in Figure 7b. These 4f → 5d absorption transitions are electric dipole
allowed transitions exhibiting very intense and broad bands, and besides,
they appear in the spectral range of the vacuum ultraviolet and ultraviolet.40,41 Thus, the wide transparency window of type III KGdP host allows
us to observe the 3H4 → 5d1 transition of Pr3+. By using the Dieke’s diagram,38 the peaks which appear at 445 and 482 nm have
been labeled as 3H4 → 3P2 and 3H4 → 3P0 electronic transitions of Pr3+, respectively.
The 4f → 4f absorption peak centered at 445 nm has the highest
intensity of these two absorption transitions because of its quite
large electric dipole oscillator strength because of its pseudo-hypersensitive
nature.41

On the other hand, it is
worth commenting that the 4f →
5d absorption transitions of Pr4+ in KGdP host are not
observed in the spectral range of 180–325 nm. That is, because
Pr4+ is isoelectronic with Ce3+, similar results
can be expected in the case of having the same host doped with Pr4+ or Ce3+.42 Hence,
taking into account the work made by Zhong et al.,43 the 4f → 5d absorption transitions of Ce3+ in KGdP host are found at 193, 209, 221, 245, and 307 nm for 4f
→ 5d5, 4f → 5d4, 4f → 5d3, 4f → 5d2, and 4f → 5d1 transitions of Ce3+, respectively, so that it can be
concluded that the 4f → 5d absorption transitions of Pr4+ are not observed in Figure 7. During the calcination process, the polymeric network
is decomposed, leading to the formation of carbon oxides in addition
to other calcination products, among them Pr:KGdP. The formation of
CO as a calcinations product is expected.44 According to the literature, CO can act as a reducing agent resulting
in its oxidation by forming CO2,45 and in this case, its oxidation could promote the reduction of praseodymium
from Pr4+ to Pr3+ because Pr4+ is
a very powerful oxidizing agent.46,47 Therefore,
it is reasonable to assume that praseodymium ions are, in the final
product, basically in Pr3+ form. Thus, the partial substitution
of Gd3+ by Pr3+ in the crystalline network of
KGdP will result in an electrically neutral structure, with higher
stability than if Pr4+ was present.

Figure 8 shows the
emission spectrum at room temperature of type III 5 at. % Pr:KGdP
nanocrystals suspended in EG under 445 nm excitation. After exciting
them at 445 nm (3H4 → 3P2 of Pr3+), five emission peaks can be observed
in the wavelength range from 590 to 850 nm. Such emission transitions
belong to 4f → 4f transitions of Pr3+. By comparing
the obtained emission spectrum with the emission spectra of Pr3+ doped in LaAlO3,48 NaGd(WO4)2,49 and
La1/2Na1/2TiO350 hosts as well as Bi3+ and Pr3+ co-doped
lead silicate glasses51 under Pr3+ 4f → 4f excitation and by using the Dieke’s diagram,38 the emission peaks have been labeled as 1D2 → 3H4, 3P0 → 3H6, 3P0 → 3F3, 3P0 → 3F4, and 1D2 → 3F2. Because its photoluminescence
under Pr3+ 4f → 4f excitation occurs from both 3P0 and 1D2 levels of Pr3+, this means that the emission from the 3P0 level is not quenched because of the presence of an intervalence
charge transfer state between these two levels, as happens in perovskite
titanates R1/2Na1/2TiO3:Pr3+ (R = La, Gd, Y, Lu)50 and in Pr3+- and Tb3+-doped double tungstate crystals KRE(WO4)2 (RE = Y, Gd, Yb, Lu).52

Figure 8 Emission
spectrum of type III 5 at. % Pr:KGdP nanocrystals suspended
in EG at room temperature under 445 nm excitation (3H4 → 3P2 of Pr3+). In
green, the labels corresponding to the electronic transitions of Pr3+ assigned to each observed band.

Figure 9 shows
the
emission spectra at room temperature under X-ray excitation of type
III Pr:KGdP nanocrystals pressed in a pellet. The most intense band
centered at 313 nm corresponds to the 6P3/2, 6P5/2, 6P7/2 → 8S7/2 transitions of Gd3+. The low intensity
bands centered at around 239 and 261 nm belong to the 5d1 → 3H4, 3H5, 3H6 and 5d1 → 3F3, 3F4, 1G4 transitions
of Pr3+, respectively, and as mentioned earlier, the 5d
→ 4f transitions of lanthanide ions are of special interest
for scintillation applications. The level transition assignation has
been done using the Dieke’s diagram38 and taking into account that the energy difference from the 5d1 level of Pr3+ in type III KGdP host to the 3H4 level is about 45 872 cm–1 (5.69 eV, 218 nm). As can be seen in the same figure, there is a
different behavior depending on the praseodymium content. Hence, the
composition that seems to be the most interesting for scintillation
applications is type III KGdP nanocrystals doped with 5 at. % of Pr
because the intensity of the bands corresponding to the 5d1 → 4f transitions of Pr3+ is the highest and at
the same time that the band corresponding to the 4f → 4f transitions
of Gd3+ is not so intense.

at. % Pr:KGdP nanocrystals as a pellet at room temperature. In purple,

to the electronic transitions of Pr3+ assigned to each
observed band.

4 Conclusions
The present paper reports on obtaining type III Pr:KGd(PO3)4 nanocrystals by the modified Pechini method for first
time up to now. As previously stated, the optimal parameters to synthesize
Pr:KGd(PO3)4 nanocrystals with a unique crystalline
phase, type III phase (space group: P21), by the modified Pechini method are CM = 3 with a pH2 = 3, CE =
2, a reaction time between metal cations and CA of 10–20 h
at 348 K under stirring followed by 4 h more at 373 K after mixing
the content of the two containers, a reaction time between metal–CA
complexes and EG of around 4 h at 473 K in a sand bath under stirring
followed by about 20 h more at the same temperature without stirring,
a first calcination at 573 K for 10 h, a second one at 773 K for 10
h, and a third one at 873 K for 7 h. By using TEM, a predominance
of the nanocrystals with sizes ranging from 10 to 20 nm has been observed.

From the transmittance measurements, it has been found that the 3H4 → 5d1 transition of Pr3+ in type III Pr:KGd(PO3)4 nanocrystals
appears as a broad and intense absorption band centered at 218 nm.
In the emission spectra of these nanocrystals under X-ray excitation,
several 5d1 → 4f transitions of Pr3+ and
the 6P3/2, 6P5/2, 6P7/2 → 8S7/2 transitions
of Gd3+ have been observed. Therefore, the 5d1 level of Pr3+ is located within the forbidden band gap
of type III KGd(PO3)4, a fact that was expected
due to the wide transparency window of the host.

Despite the
lower intensity of the bands corresponding to the 5d1 →
4f transitions of Pr3+ in comparison
with the band corresponding to the 4f → 4f transitions of Gd3+, it would be interesting to excite the nanocrystals under
direct f–d excitation to obtain the decay time curves from
the 5d1 level as well as to excite once again with high-energy
radiation to widely study their scintillation properties.
