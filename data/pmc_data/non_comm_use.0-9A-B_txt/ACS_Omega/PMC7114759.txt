The Cu migration
is controlled by using an optimized AlOx interfacial layer, and effects on resistive
switching performance, artificial synapse, and human saliva detection
in an amorphous-oxygenated-carbon (a-COx)-based CBRAM platform have been investigated for the first time.
The 4 nm-thick AlOx layer in the Cu/AlOx/a-COx/TiNxOy/TiN structure
shows consecutive >2000 DC switching, tight distribution of SET/RESET
voltages, a long program/erase (P/E) endurance of >109 cycles
at a low operation current of 300 μA, and artificial synaptic
characteristics under a small pulse width of 100 ns. After a P/E endurance
of >108 cycles, the Cu migration is observed by both
ex
situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy mapping images. Furthermore, the optimized Cu/AlOx/a-COx/TiNxOy/TiN CBRAM detects
glucose with a low concentration of 1 pM, and real-time measurement
of human saliva with a small sample volume of 1 μL is also detected
repeatedly in vitro. This is owing to oxidation–reduction of
Cu electrode, and the switching mechanism is explored. Therefore,
this CBRAM device is beneficial for future artificial intelligence
application.

==== Body
Introduction
The conductive bridge
resistive random access memory (CBRAM)1,2 has been considered
as one of the memristors3 that will meet
the technological requirements4 such as
miniaturization, long program/erase (P/E) endurance
(>109 cycles5−7), high speed (∼10 ns),
and low energy operation
(∼10 pJ). To achieve the above requirements, various types
of materials like HfO2,5,8 Ta2O5,9 insulating polymers,10 carbon-based materials,11−14 and so on have been reported.
Recently, amorphous carbon (a-C)-based switching materials (SMs) are
beneficial owing to its wafer-scale fabrication,15 wide energy gap (2–5 eV),15 and high metal diffusivity with low activation energy (0.76 eV for
Cu).16 Tao et al. have reported the resistive
switching by using a Cu/dual-layer-nanoporous-carbon/Pt structure,
and a P/E endurance of 105 cycles under a high current
of 1 mA is shown.14 Similarly, the a-COx-based materials are also useful because they
have shown good chemical stability,17 high
electrical resistivity,17 and a high dielectric
constant of ∼15.12 As compared to
Ta2O5 SM, the a-COx material is scalable and low cost for CBRAM application.17 Murdoch et al. have investigated resistive switching
using a Ag/a-COx/Pt structure under a
high current compliance (CC) of 10 mA.18 Xu et al. have reported the resistive switching in Cu/a-COx/Pt atomic switches at a CC of 500 μA.19 Although the a-COx is a favorable material, however, a single switching layer is insufficient
to control Cu migration, and a long P/E endurance at a low operation
current is a challenging task.

Therefore, interface engineering
by choosing a suitable material
like Ti,20,21 Al2O3,22−25 nanopore graphene,26 and porous Ir6 is an effective approach to control the Cu migration,
and the switching performance should be improved drastically. In addition,
the oxidation of Cu electrode (i.e., Cu to CuOx) in CBRAM produces higher Cu migration due to weak Cu–O
bonding than pure Cu–Cu bonding (1.5 eV vs 2 eV).22 Considering the Gibbs free energy of CO/CO2 (−137.16 and 394.39 kJ/mol), Cu2O/CuO (−149
and −129.7 kJ/mol), and Al2O3 (−1582.3
kJ/mol) at 300 K,27 Al can work as an interfacial
layer, which could react with oxygen from the CuOx/a-COx interface and form an
AlOx layer. Moreover, the high thermal
conductivity of Al2O3 (15 W/m·K)28 is an another advantage for conductive filament
(CF) formation/dissolution in low thermal conductivity materials like
a-C (∼1 W/m·K).29 In addition,
the Al2O3 thin film has a higher energy gap
of >7 eV, which will help to maintain a high resistance ratio and
serves an interfacial layer.22−25 Shin et al. have reported self-CC of 10 nA by using
Al2O3 in the Cu/CuOx/LT-Al2O3/HT-Al2O3/Pd
structure and a P/E endurance of 103 cycles under a long
pulse width of 5 ms.22 Kumar et al. have
reported a DC endurance of >1.6 × 104 cycles using
the Cu/Ta/SiCN/Al2O3/TiN structure at a high
CC of 500 μA.23 Barci et al. have
reported a P/E endurance of 105 cycles using the CuTex/GdOx/Al2O3/metal structure at a long pulse of 1 μs.24 Vishwanath et al. have reported a P/E endurance
of 2 × 103 cycles using the Cu/AlOx/Al2O3/Pt structure at an operation
current of 100 μA to 10 mA.25 Therefore,
we have investigated an optimized AlOx IL in the Cu/AlOx/a-COx/TiNxOy/TiN structure to achieve the controlled Cu migration and a longer
P/E endurance at a small P/E pulse width of 100 ns.

Recently,
the research in the field of CBRAM is also focused on
brain-inspired neuromorphic computing.30−35 In neuromorphic computing, the CBRAM device can act as the two terminal
artificial synapses between pre-synaptic neuron and post-synaptic
neuron.36 At the artificial synapse, a
low energy of 10 fJ is required for every signal transport from pre-
to post-neurons.37 Due to high scalability,17 fast switching,17 and good endurance (>109 cycles) of the CBRAM devices,14,17 the a-C-based resistive switching material is one of the potential
candidates for neuromorphic applications; however, the research on
these devices have not extended yet. Bachmann et al. have reported
the Pt/a-COx/W memristor with 16 conducting
states at sub-picojoule energy consumption.38 Although, the CBRAM devices have shown low power operation,30 the switching variability due to high metal
migration is a disadvantage for neuromorphic applications. Therefore,
the interface engineering is needed to obtain good synaptic characteristics.
Raeber et al. have reported the Pt/ta-C/a-COx/Ag structure with consecutive 100 switching cycles at a high CC
of 5 mA, and paired-pulse inhibition at biorealistic time scales of
<100 ms is also evaluated.12 Lim et
al. have achieved consecutive 100 depression states using the Cu/Cu2–xS/WO3–x/W structure.33 Jo et al. have investigated
the Pt nanowire/AgSi/a-Si/Si/W structure, and they have achieved 100
long-term potentiation (LTP) states and 100 long-term depression (LTD)
states under a long pulse width of 300 μs.36 Therefore, an optimized AlOx IL in a-COx-based CBRAM device will
be beneficial for neuromorphic application.

On the other hand,
diabetes is one of the serious chronic diseases
in humans, which is caused by the insufficient insulin production
or the excessive rise of blood glucose.39 Due to lack of known cure methods, it is necessary to monitor the
blood glucose in our body to overcome its complications through appropriate
medication or early diagnosis of blood sugar level. Self-monitoring
the blood glucose through disposable blood glucose test strips is
currently one of the widely using methods. However, its invasive sensing
method involves blood sampling from finger pricking, which is an inconvenience
for the patients to monitor the number of required tests.40 Recent advancements in noninvasive glucose sensing
through contact lenses and tattoos have shown promising approaches;
however, it requires further validation for commercial application.41,42 Other non-invasive sensing approaches have been proposed to sense
glucose in body fluids such as sweat and tears.42,43 Liu et al.43 have reported a Au gate/In2O3/PET field-effect transistor sensor for enzymatic
glucose monitoring in various body fluids with a linear range of 10
nM to 1 mM. The glucose levels in these fluids are much lower than
in blood. Therefore, a highly sensitive glucose sensor is necessary
for the continuous glucose monitoring. Several research groups have
reported different types of glucose sensors.44−46 Cella et al.
have reported glucose detection using a single-walled carbon nanotube
(SWCNT)-based field-effect transistor, and they have used cyclic voltammetry.44 Chang et al.45 have
used a flower-like Ag nanocrystals (NCs)-based electrochemical sensor
for glucose sensing.

Recently, saliva has been considered as
one of the useful non-invasive
methods due to its easy collection without any pain. Glucose can directly
be detected by using natural human saliva without sample preparation
owing to a negligible interference effect also.47 Saliva has a high correlation with blood glucose concentrations.48 Therefore, saliva can be used as alternative
diagnosis to monitor the glucose levels of the diabetes patients.48−51 Jiang et al.48 have reported Au nanoparticles-decorated
Au NP/CTS/CeO2/GCE electrodes. Chakraborty et al.49 have reported CuO porous nanostructure electrodes
for non-enzymatic salivary glucose detection with a range of 5–225
μM. However, sensing concentrations of these reports are still
high. To detect low concentrations for early diagnosis of a disease,
the CBRAM platform has been chosen due to low cost Cu and a small
device area. In this report, we propose a Cu/AlOx/a-COx/TiNxOy/TiN CBRAM device as a highly
sensitive glucose sensor with a minimum detection of 1 pM, and a small
sample volume of 1 μL is used. This approach is useful to monitor
real-time human saliva in the future.

In this article, we conduct
a detailed study on the resistive switching
characteristics and controlled Cu migration by inserting an optimized
AlOx IL in the a-COx-based CBRAM device for the first time. The CBRAM device
with a 4 nm-thick AlOx IL shows consecutive
>2000 I–V switching, and
a long P/E endurance (>109 cycles) at a P/E current
of
300 μA and a small P/E pulse width of 100 ns is applied. The
Cu migration is investigated through ex situ TEM analysis after >108 P/E cycles. The optimized CBRAM device exhibits superior
artificial synaptic characteristics under a low power consumption
of 6.7–13.3 pJ. Moreover, it is interesting to note that the
Cu/AlOx/a-COx/TiNxOy/TiN
device detects glucose and human saliva with a small sample volume
of 1 μL, and the resistive switching mechanism is explored through
oxidation–reduction of Cu active electrode. Therefore, these
combined results by using a single Cu/AlOx/a-COx/TiNxOy/TiN structure can contribute for nanoscale
memory, bioinspired synapse, and human saliva detection in the future.

Results
and Discussion
CBRAM devices using a-COx SM in the
Cu/AlOx/a-COx/TiNxOy/TiN
structure with different AlOx IL thicknesses
of 4 nm (S2), 7 nm (S3), or 10 nm (S4) were fabricated, as described
in Table S1. The devices without an Al
interfacial layer or AlOx IL (S1) and
without an Al capping layer (S5) were fabricated for glucose/saliva
detection.

Schematic View with Glucose Sensing Mechanism and TEM with Elemental
Analysis
A schematic view shows typical Cu/AlOx/a-COx/TiNxOy/TiN resistive switching
memory including the glucose/saliva detection mechanism (Figure 1a). The CBRAM device
is also beneficial for glucose and human saliva detection repeatedly,
which is explained later. Figure S1a represents
the cross-sectional TEM image of the pristine Al/Cu/AlOx/a-COx/TiNxOy/TiN device with an
area of 0.4 × 0.4 μm2, whose size is smaller
than required.7Figure 1b depicts the HRTEM image of the S2 device,
captured from a marked region of Figure S1a. The Cu TE, Al interfacial layer, a-COx SM, and TiN BE are observed clearly. After the deposition of TiN,
partially crystalline TiNxOy is formed on the TiN surface and observed at a-COx/TiN interface (Figure 1b). From the HRTEM image, the thicknesses
of Al IL, a-COx SM, and TiNxOy are found to be 4.5,
4.3, and 2.9 nm, respectively. Both the a-COx and Al layers are amorphous. The inset of Figure 1b shows the fast Fourier transformation (FFT)
and inverse fast Fourier transformation (IFFT) images of the Cu TE
at the marked region in Figure 1b. The d-spacing value is 2.09 Å, which
is attributed to the Cu (111) plane, and this is similar to the reported
value (2.08 Å).6 To understand the
elemental composition of our device, the high-angle annular dark-field
imaging (HAADF) is employed by scanning TEM (STEM) from the BE to
TE (Figure 1c). The
elemental mapping and EDS line profiles are shown in Figure 1c,d and Figure S1b–i. The a-COx layer is well defined with other deposited layers. The elemental
mapping of oxygen (Figure S1) and the EDS
line profile reveal the presence of oxygen in Al IL, the a-COx, and TiNxOy layers, and the corresponding mass percentage
values are 30, 27, and 19%, respectively. In addition, the presence
of oxygen is observed in the a-COx films
owing to available oxygen in a chamber. Due to the low Gibbs free
energy of Al2O3 (−1582.3 kJ/mol) than
CO (−137.16 kJ/mol) or CO2 (394.39 kJ/mol) at 300
K,27 the Al IL consumes oxygen from both
the a-COx and CuOx layers. The mass % of oxygen and Al at the a-COx/Cu TE interface are 30 and 24%, respectively. This forms
AlOx IL. The small amount of C (5 mass
%) in a-COx layer is found (Figure 1c,d) because of the thin layer.
The presence of Cu (15 mass %) is observed in the AlOx layer, suggesting that Cu is partially diffused
through the AlOx layer during the deposition.
Therefore, AlOx IL behaves as a buffer
layer,9 which controls the Cu migration
through a-COx SM. In addition, XPS shows
the carbon-to-oxygen bonding in the a-COx film and the oxidation states in Cu (Figure S2). In the narrow scan Cu2p3/2 spectra, the peak
at a binding energy of 932.5 eV represents the pure metallic Cu film
with “0” oxidation state.52 Under the external bias, this pure Cu TE through oxidation–reduction
(Cu ↔ Cuz+ + ze–, z = 1, 2) properties is the
reason for resistive switching, potentiation/depression, and glucose/saliva
detection. First, the bipolar resistive switching characteristics
are discussed below.

inset of (b) shows the FFT and IFFT images corresponding to the Cu
(111) plane. (c) HAADF image and elemental mapping images of Al, C,
and Cu. (d) EDS line profile of the S2 device.

Resistive Switching Characteristics
Figure 2a represents consecutive 2000 I–V switching cycles without any
failure at a low CC of 300 μA. The voltage sweeping directions
are denoted by arrows accordingly 1 → 2 → 3 →
4. Figure S3 shows cumulative probability
distribution of formation voltage (Vform) of the S1, S2 S3, and S4 devices. The Vform increases with increasing AlOx thickness.53 The operation voltages of all devices are optimized
manually and measured DC cycles. The SET voltage (VSET) and RESET voltage (VRESET) of the S2 devices are approximately 0.6 and −0.47 V, respectively. I–V characteristics of the S1, S3,
and S4 devices at a CC of 300 μA are shown in Figure S4; however, those devices show large dispersions of
high resistance state (HRS) and low resistance state (LRS). From the I–V curves, the RESET currents of
the S1, S3, and S4 devices exceed over CC owing to the uncontrolled
Cu migration. However, the RESET current of the S2 device is similar
to a CC of 300 μA, suggesting the controlled Cu migration by
the optimized AlOx interfacial layer.
For a fair comparison, the HRS and LRS values of all devices are plotted,
as shown in Figure 2b,c. It is observed that the LRS of the S2 device is highly stable
throughout the 2000 DC cycles because of thin and stable CF formation
for every SET process. The HRS is slightly dispersed due to the variation
in the dissolution length of the CF. The HRS and LRS values of the
S2 devices at 50% probability are found to be 75.5 and 2.1 kΩ,
respectively. A good resistance ratio of approximately 37 is obtained.
On the other hand, the HRS value of the S1 device is gradually decreased
after 400 cycles and fails after 600 cycles. However, both S3 and
S4 devices show longer 1000 DC cycles with large LRS variation from
4 kΩ to 100 Ω owing to non-uniform CF formation, which
leads to a higher CC. The HRS values for the S1, S3, and S4 devices
at 50% probability are 62.5, 20.5, and 61.3 kΩ, while the LRS
values are 1.75, 1.61, and 1.52 kΩ, respectively. To further
understand the effect AlOx IL thickness, I–V characteristics of the S1, S2,
S3, and S4 devices are measured at a higher CC of 1 mA (Figure S5). The S2 device shows consecutive 2000
DC cycles with the uniform HRS and LRS, suggesting well-controlled
Cu migration. The S1 and S4 devices failed after 549 and 900 cycles,
respectively. Interestingly, the S3 device also shows consecutive
2000 DC cycles without any failure. This indicates that the S3 device
works well at a higher CC of 1 mA, suggesting that the high energy
is required to control the Cu migration. The LRS values for the S1,
S2, S3, and S4 devices are found to be 419, 516, 476, and 382 Ω,
respectively. The LRS values at the CC of 1 mA are less than 300 μA
CC owing to the formation of a large-diameter CF. On the other hand,
the LRS value decreases with increasing the thickness of the AlOx layer. In our previous report, the Cu migration
under the applied electric field is higher in thicker Al2O3 oxide-electrolyte than the thinner one.54 Therefore, thicker interfacial layers have a
higher RESET current and poor DC cycles owing to a randomly formed
larger diameter of CFs. On the other hand, the S1 device has a CuOx interfacial layer, which allows higher Cu migration,
and unstable DC cycles are observed.

curves of the S2 device

Uniformity and Comparison with Reported Results
Figure S6 shows device-to-device cumulative distribution
of the HRS and LRS of the S2 devices at CCs of 300 μA and 1
mA, respectively. Arbitrarily, 25 devices have been chosen for this
study. The HRS/LRS shows good uniformity in cycle-to-cycle and device-to-device.
The DC cycles are comparable even it is better than the reported results
(Table 1).5,6,11,14,23,24,55 Zhao et al. have reported 1000 DC cycles using the
Cu/a-C/Pt structure at a CC of 10 mA.11 The VSET and VRESET distributions of DC cycles are plotted, as shown in Figure 2d and Figures S7 and S8. At 300 μA CC, the S2
device shows tight distributions of VSET (from 0.4 to 0.5 V, 92%) and VRESET (from
−0.38 to −0.475 V, 90%) for more than 2000 cycles. The VSET distribution for the S1, S3, and S4 devices
are 0.2–0.9 V, 0.3–0.9 V, and 0.2–1.2 V, while
the VRESET distribution for those devices
are −0.1 to −0.9 V, −0.19 to −0.95 V,
and – 0.1 to −0.9 V, respectively (Figure 2d and Figure S7). The S1, S3, and S4 devices show wide distributions of VSET and VRESET.
On the other hand, both S2 and S3 devices at a CC of 1 mA show tight
distributions of VSET (0.4–0.6
V, 96% and 0.5–0.7 V, 90%) and VRESET (−0.38 to −0.57 V, 94% and −0.2 to −0.4
V, 96%), as shown in Figure S8. However,
the S1 and S4 devices show a wide distribution (Figure S8). The tight distribution of VSET and VRESET represents the uniform
formation/dissolution of CF, and a long P/E endurance at a low operation
current is achieved, which is discussed later. To understand the device
performance, the current transport mechanism is explained below.

Transport Characteristics
A typical I–V curve of the S2 device at a
low CC of
300 μA is fitted for different conduction mechanisms (Figure S9). The HRS current under –Ve bias is replotted in ln(J/T2) vs √E scale, and this shows the
Schottky conduction. The dynamic dielectric constant (εsch) and Schottky barrier height (ϕB) are
calculated from the slope and intercept in eqs 1and 2 below:56 1   2  where q is
the electronic charge, ε0 is the permittivity of
free space, εsch is the relative permittivity of
dielectric medium, kB is the Boltzmann’s
constant, T is the absolute temperature, and ϕB is the Schottky barrier height. The εsch and the ϕB values are found to be 5.32 and 0.28
eV, respectively. The refractive index (n) value
is 2.3, which follows the equation εsch = n2. Stagg et al. have reported that the n value of a-C is 2.32 at a wavelength of 500 nm.57 The n value of our device is
similar to the reported one. The LRS current is well fitted in ln(I) vs ln(V), which exhibits ohmic conduction
with a slope of 0.95. In our previous report, we have reported the
Schottky conduction at the HRS and ohmic conduction at the LRS using
the Cu/Ir/TiNxOy/TiN structure.6

Program/Erase Endurance
The P/E endurance characteristics
of the S1, S2, S3, and S4 devices are shown in Figure 3 and Figure S10. A small P/E pulse width of 100 ns is applied. To obtain a long
P/E endurance, the P/E voltages are optimized for all the devices.
A long P/E endurance of more than 109 cycles is achieved
without resistance verification circuit for the S2 devices at a low
operation current of 300 μA (Figure 3a). A long P/E endurance of >1.5 ×
109 cycles under an operation current of 1 mA is also obtained.
The energy consumptions of the device during program and erase are
36 and 24 pJ, respectively. In Figure 3a, it is found that variation of the LRS/HRS at initial
cycles is observed, and it has plausible random formation or complete
dissolution of CFs in a-COx SM. During
these initial cycles, continuous stress is developed, and the heat
enhances the sp2 cluster formation in a-COx SM. Zhao et al.11 have
reported that the degree of sp2 clustering is increased
after a current of 100 μA using the Cu/a-C/Pt structure. The
sp2 clustering helps to create uniform CFs also.11 The S2 device shows a long P/E endurance owing
to the key role of the optimized AlOx interfacial
layer, and the enhancement of the sp2 clustering under
the continuous SET/RESET pulses. On the other hand, the P/E endurance
at a high operation current of 1 mA does not show fluctuation at initial
cycles because the sp2 clustering is formed. Although the
enhancement of the sp2 cluster occurs in the S3 and S4
devices, the Cu migration is higher due to defective thicker AlOx ILs and restricts the performance. In contrast
to the S2 device, the S1 device fails after 5 × 107 cycles (Figure 3b).
The S3 device shows a slightly longer P/E endurance of 2 × 108 cycles than the S1 and S4 devices (5 × 107 cycles). However, both S2 and S3 devices at the programming current
of 1 mA are shown to have a long P/E endurance of more than 109 and 6 × 108 cycles, respectively (Figure S10). On the other hand, the S1 and S4
devices fail after 4 × 107 and 8 × 107 cycles, respectively. Table 1 shows the comparison of our P/E endurance with recently reported
results using various SMs.5,6,11,14,23,24,55 In addition,
the COx-based device shows a longer P/E
endurance than the Ta2O5-based CBRAM (>109 vs 106 cycles).58 The
S2 devices show uniform and stable data retention of over 104 s at an operation current of 300 μA (Figure S11). The stable data retention is explained by measuring the
activation energy (Figure S12). The HRS
value decreases with increasing temperature, suggesting the defect-dependent
current conduction. The activation energy is 0.26 eV, which is similar
to the reported value of 0.28 eV.59 The
LRS value increases with increasing temperature, which confirms the
typical metallic behavior or ohmic (Figure S9). The activation energy at the LRS is 0.17 eV. The low activation
energy of the Cu filament depends on various factors, such as hopping
distance, migration speed, and temperature.59 Rehman et al. have reported a similar activation energy value of
0.14 eV for Cu CF in the Al/Cu2Se/Pt structure.60 For further understanding of the Cu migration-based
CF, the ex situ TEM analysis is employed as discussed below.

Cu Filament by HRTEM Analysis
After forming the S2
devices at a CC of 10 μA, the cross-sectional TEM image is obtained
(Figure S13). The inset of HRTEM image
demonstrates the FFT and IFFT images, which are captured from the
marked regions. The d-spacing value at the AlOx/a-COx region is
2.06 Å, which corresponds to the Cu(111) plane.6 The elemental composition at this region is also characterized
by EDS line scan profiling and elemental mapping (Figures S14 and S15). The Cu content at the a-COx/AlOx interface is lower
(12%), suggesting the controlled Cu migration by AlOx IL. The Cu value is 27% in a-COx SM, which represents the accumulation of migrated Cu. The surface
of TiN BE is likely TiOx, and a small
Cu amount of 5% is observed. Alén et al. have reported that
the 3-nm-thick TiO2 layer works as a diffusion barrier
of Cu.61 Thus, a small amount of Cu is
found in the TiOx layer. From the evidence
of Cu migration, these results reveal the formation of Cu CFs. After
operating at >108 P/E cycles and keeping the device
to
SET, the strong Cu migration is observed (Figure S16). Figure 4 shows the HRTEM image, which is captured at the marked region II
(Figure S16b). The a-COx and AlOx layers are amorphous,
except a crystalline region is observed, as shown in the marked region.
The d-spacing value of the crystal region is also
referred to the Cu (111) plane.6 From the
EDS line profile (Figure S17), the Cu counts
at the a-COx/AlOx interface, a-COx, and TiOx are 20, 40, and 11%, respectively. Those values
are higher than those of the forming device. The higher Cu counts
in the a-COx and AlOx layers have been observed in elemental mapping (Figure S18). Therefore, this suggests that the
Cu concentration in CF increases with increasing P/E cycles. Lv et
al. have analyzed the similar phenomena after DC cycles in the Cu/HfO2/Pt structure.5

Figure 4 HRTEM image of the stressed
S2 device. The S2 device after a P/E
endurance of 108 cycles (stressed) is used for the TEM
analysis. The d-spacing from FFT and IFFT images
(inset images) corresponds to the Cu (111) plane. The image at region
II is captured from Figure S16b.

Switching Mechanism
The resistive
switching mechanism
is also explained schematically, as illustrated in Figure S19. During the SET process (Figure S19b), a 4 nm-thick AlOx interfacial
layer controls the Cuz+ ion migration.
The generated Cu ions (Cu0 → Cu2+ + 2e–; Cu0 → Cu+ + e–) at the AlOx/a-COx interface are observed by cyclic voltammetry (CV), as shown
in Figure S20. The Cu oxidation using the
Cu/Ta2O5/Pt structure is also reported by Tsuruoka
et al.62 The Cu ions are migrated through
a-COx SM, also confirmed by both CV and
ex situ TEM images. The Cu ions are reduced at the a-COx/TiNxOy interface because electrons are tunneled through the TiNxOy layer from the
TiN BE. The TiNxOy layer shows a less amount of oxygen (19%), which is metallic-like.63 Considering the work functions of TiO2 (∼4.8 eV)64 and TiN (4.3–4.65
eV),65 the work function difference at
the TiNxOy/TiN BE is relatively low, which leads to ohmic. Therefore, a large
number of electrons pass through this thin TiNxOy layer and reduces the Cuz+ ions into Cu0. Considering the
work function of Al (4.06–4.26 eV), a positive built-in potential
(0.24–0.39 eV) in the Al/a-COx/TiN
structure helps to control Cu ion migration. On the other hand, a
negative built-in potential (−0.35 eV) in the Cu/a-COx/TiN structure does not control Cu migration,
even oxidation of the CF is possible during SET. Therefore, the Cu
ions are migrated randomly for the S1 devices. Similarly, the thicker
AlOx interfacial layers show also a huge
amount of Cu migration and thicker CF formation in the a-COx SM. Many research groups have reported that
the thin Al2O3 layer, which works as a Cu diffusion
barrier.22,66 It is known that the thermal conductivity
of Al2O3 (15 W/m·K) is higher than a-C
(0.01–0.1 W/m·K) and TiO2 (8.5 W/m·K).67 During the RESET process (Figure S19c), heat will be transferred easily through the
AlOx buffer layer than the a-COx SM, and the temperature rises at the low thermal
conductive a-COx layer. The CF temperature
increases at the AlOx/a-COx interface. Therefore, the CF dissolves at the AlOx/a-COx interface
first and leaves a small part of the CF at the a-COx/TiNxOy interface. During the next SET process, the residual CF68 in the a-COx layer
enhances the electric field and therefore allows us to form uniform
CF at the dissolved region. However, the degree of sp2 clustering
also helps restricted Cu migration through a-COx after certain P/E cycles. Therefore, these lead to high
resistive switching memory performance.

Artificial Synapse Characteristics
Due to the long
P/E endurance ability, good conductance modulation (i.e., potentiation/depression)
is expected, which is essential to emulate the biological synaptic
behavior. Typical analog I–V characteristics of the S2 device are demonstrated by applying a
positive voltage for potentiation (Figure 5a) and a negative voltage for depression
(Figure 5b). By considering
the VSET and VRESET distributions of all the devices (Figure S8), the optimized voltages have been chosen to avoid the abrupt switching.
During the potentiation, the device undergoes partial SET to initiate
the CF or incremental filament formation, as shown in the inset of Figure 5a. When consecutive
voltage sweeps (0 → 0.5 V) are applied on the S2 devices, the
conductance gradually increases for each voltage sweep, and a maximum
of 37–40 distinguished states are obtained. When consecutive
negative voltage sweeps (0 → −0.4 V) are applied, the
conductance gradually decreases for each sweep. Hence, a maximum of
48–54 distinguished states are obtained. During depression,
the CF experiences incremental dissolution due to the subsequent application
of constant negative voltage. This leads to a gradual decrease of
current conduction. The potentiation/depression of the S2 device are
replotted as conductance vs number of DC sweeps (Figure 5c), where the gradual increase
or decrease of the conductance can be seen clearly. Obviously, the
conductivity modulations of the S1, S3, and S4 devices are inferior,
as shown in Figures S21 and S22. Sun et
al. have reported 16 conducting states during gradual SET (0.6 V,
10 V/s) and 30 conducting states during gradual RESET (−0.8
V, 13 V/s) by using the Ag/GeSe/TiN structure.35 In our previous report, we have reported potentiation/depression
characteristics with the maximum of 10 and 25 conductance states by
using the Cu/Ir/TiNxOy/TiN structure.6 Due to the achievement
of considerable conductance states in the S2 and S3 devices, the artificial
synaptic behavior is further evaluated by applying a short pulse width
of 100 ns (Figure 5d and Figure S23). The pulse amplitudes
of the S2 and S3 devices are applied similarly as 100 ns. The conductance
is monitored at a Vread of ±0.2 V
(2 ms pulse width). The conductance in the S2 and S3 devices increases
with increasing the number of applied positive pulses (LTP), while
it decreases with increasing the number of applied negative pulses
(LTD). The LTP/LTD conductance states in the S2 devices are stable
up to 59/101 consecutive positive/negative pulses, while those states
for the S3 devices are 25/65. Those numbers can be improved further
by using 1T1R (one transistor one resistor) configuration because
the current overshoot effect can be reduced also. The energy consumption
range of the S2 device during the LTP is 6.7–13.3 pJ, and it
is lower than the S3 devices (13.4–32.5 pJ). Our data is compared
with the recently reported results (Table 2).30,32−36 Shi et al. have demonstrated 256 conducting states using the ZrTe/Al2O3/Ta-based subquantum CBRAM.30 Chen et al. have reported 190/140 conducting states using
the Cu/SiO2/W structure.34 However,
our S2 device shows comparable energy consumption with other reported
results, which is beneficial for future brain-inspired neuromorphic
application.

Glucose Sensing and Mechanism
Due
to the oxidation/reduction
properties of Cu, the S5 device with an optimized AlOx interfacial layer is used for glucose/saliva detection.
The glucose/human saliva detection is also shown schematically in Figure 1a. First, pH 7.4
solution with a sample volume of 1 μL is dropped on 4 ×
4 μm2 via-hole. Then, I–V characteristics within sweeping voltages of ±2 V
are shown in Figure 6a. The sweeping voltage paths are shown in arrows from 1 →
2 → 3 → 4. For biosensing, we are using the pristine
CBRAM device before the SET/RESET voltage. The paths 1 and 2 are fitted
to the Schottky conduction mechanism (Figure S24). The ϕB values are calculated from the intercept
(eq 2) and plotted with
respect to the sweeping voltages (Figure 6b). As the sweeping voltage increases, the
ϕB values of path 1 are almost the same, and the
current conduction in the device is constant owing to the reduction
of Cu TE. However, the ϕB values of path 2 are gradually
increased with increasing sweeping voltage. This increment value of
ϕB controls the current conduction owing to the partial
oxidation of Cu TE. The εsch values with applied
voltages of −1, −1.5, and – 2 V are 6.5, 5.35,
and 7.53, while the n values are 2.55, 2.34, and
2.74 for the path 1, respectively. These n values
are similar to the reported value of Cu2O (2.73 at a wavelength
of 600 nm).69 The εsch values are 4.4, 3.24, and 2.24, while the n values
are 2.09, 1.8, and 1.49 for the path 2, respectively. These n values are similar to the reported value of CuO (∼1.6
at a wavelength of 546 nm).70 Typical I–t characteristics of the device
in the presence of buffer solution (pH 7.4), buffer plus glucose oxidase,
and 1 pM glucose solutions are measured at a Vread of −0.2 V (Figure S25). The current levels are similar when pH 7.4 and 15 units GOx enzyme
are dropped on the device. However, the saturated current level is
suddenly decreased when 1 pM glucose is added. The glucose in the
presence of GOx enzyme produces gluconic acid and H2O2, as shown in eq 3 below: 3  

Figure 6 (a) I–V hysteresis characteristics
in the presence of buffer solution (pH 7.4) with different sweeping
voltages from ±1 to ±2 V. (b) Barrier height (ϕB) vs applied negative voltage plot. (c) Plot of normalized
current shift vs glucose concentration from 1 pM to 1 nM. A minimum

f) Repeatable human saliva detection of (e) the same device and (f)
device-to-device after a short response time of 5 s.

As the glucose concentration increases from 1 pM to 1 nM,
the production
of H2O2 content increases. This H2O2 oxidizes Cu TE from Cu0 to Cuz+ (where z = 1, 2), and the ϕB value at the Cu/AlOx interface
increases, and therefore the current decreases. As compared to the
buffer plus GOx, the saturated current level in the I–t plot drops gradually as the concentration
of glucose increases from 1 pM to 1 nM. From the I–t plot, we have replotted the glucose concentration
vs normalized current (ΔI/I0) (where ΔI = I1pM glucose – I0, I0 is the current at a time response
of 5 s for buffer plus oxidase), as shown in Figure 6c. We have fitted the glucose concentration
vs normalized current plot in eq 4 below: 4  

The slope
(S) and intercept (G) values are
found to be −0.05642 and – 0.498, respectively.
As glucose the concentration increases from 1 pM to 1 nM, the normalized
current is decreased from −0.475 to −0.874. A high sensitivity
of 0.475 pM–1 is achieved for a low concentration
of 1 pM glucose. Table 3 shows a comparison of our glucose sensing and glucose in saliva
detection in the literature.39,41−43,48−50 Our result
is comparable, and it is even better than the reported values.

Saliva Detection
This highly sensitive glucose sensor
is beneficial for noninvasive sensing of body fluids such as human
saliva. The S5 device is used to detect glucose in human saliva. At
first, we have mixed 50 μL of human saliva in 50 μL of
GOx (25 units). The 1 μL sample solution in vitro is used for
each real-time measurement (pH 7.4 and human saliva plus GOx). Figure 6d shows typical I–t response of pH 7.4 and human
saliva plus GOx. The saturated current of pH 7.4 solution is approximately
48 nA at 5 s. In comparison to pH 7.4, the current is decreased to
13.3 nA for the human saliva plus GOx. This suggests that the GOx
reacts selectively with available glucose in human saliva and produces
H2O2, and the saturated current decreases by
Cu oxidation. The current of human saliva plus GOx is similar to 100
pM glucose (13.3 nA), as shown in Figure 6c. By using eq 4, the glucose concentration in saliva from a human
is approximately 70 pM. Repeatable measurements of human saliva with
respect to pH 7.4 buffer are shown in Figure 6e. The same device can detect saliva more
than three times. A typical current value at pH 7.4 for the first
time is slightly higher than the next measurement (∼50 nA vs
∼42 nA). This suggests that Cu TE is partially reduced to Cu0 in the presence of pH 7.4 after saliva measurement. Further
study is needed to reach a pristine current. However, our device shows
repeatable saliva detection, and this shows good detection for the
device-to-device also (Figure 6f). The currents of devices are 13 ± 1 and 44 ±
3 nA for saliva plus GOx and pH 7.4 after 5 s, respectively. In this
study, the Cu electrode in the novel Cu/AlOx/a-COx/TiNxOy/TiN CBRAM device is used to detect
human saliva even if a small sample volume of 1 μL has been
used in vitro. The optimized AlOx IL-based
CBRAM device shows excellent resistive switching characteristics with
a P/E endurance of >1.5 × 109 cycles, artificial
synapse
characteristics (LTP and LTD), and glucose/human saliva detection
under lower concentration levels, which opens a wide window for future
new application.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the role
of a thin AlOx IL is controlling Cu migration,
and the resistive switching memory
performance, superior artificial synapse, and human saliva detection
using a Cu/AlOx/a-COx/TiNxOy/TiN memory platform are investigated for the first time. The AlOx layer and a-COx layers are observed by both TEM and EDS analyses. As compared to
other thicknesses of IL, the 4 nm-thick AlOx layer controls Cu migration and exhibits stable switching of more
than 2000 DC cycles, uniform distribution of SET/RESET voltages, and
a long P/E endurance of >1.5 × 109 cycles under
an
operation current of 300–103 μA, and a small
P/E pulse width of 100 ns is applied. The evidence of Cu migration
is observed by ex situ HRTEM, which is owing to the Cu filamentary-based
resistive switching. In addition, the S2 device shows superior conductance
modulation with long LTP/LTD states of 59/101 under a small pulse
width of 100 ns, and a low energy of 6.7–13.3 pJ is required.
The CBRAM device detects glucose with a low concentration of 1 pM,
which is owing to good oxidation–reduction of Cu. Similarly,
the Cu migration in the CBRAM is due to oxidation–reduction
of Cu under external bias, and conductive filament formation/dissolution
is obtained. It is noted that human saliva with a small sample volume
of 1 μL is also detected repeatedly in vitro by using the CBRAM.
This will be useful to find the sugar level of a diabetic patient
using this easy method, or this will help in diagnosis at an early
stage of other human diseases in the future. This Cu/AlOx/a-COx/TiNxOy/TiN-based CBRAM paves
a way for future possible AI application.

Experimental Section
Memory
Device Fabrication
First, a 200 nm-thick SiO2 layer
on Si was deposited by thermal oxidation. Then, a 40
nm-thick TiN as a bottom electrode (BE) on 160 nm-thick Ti was deposited.
To create the 0.4 × 0.4 μm2 size via-holes,
a 150 nm-thick SiO2 layer was deposited on the TiN/Ti/SiO2/Si stack. The a-COx oxide-electrolyte
SM with a thickness of 5 nm was deposited by radio frequency sputtering.
The carbon target with a purity of 99.95% was used. During deposition,
the chamber pressure, Ar flow rate, and radio frequency power were
maintained at 9 × 10–6 Torr, 10 sccm, and 100
W, respectively. To optimize the resistive switching performance,
Al IL (which will form AlOx) with a thickness
of 4, 7, or 10 nm was deposited on the a-COx SM by thermal evaporation. Finally, a 40 nm-thick Cu as a top electrode
(TE) and 160 nm-thick Al as a capping layer were deposited by using
thermal evaporation. Then, a lift-off process was performed to obtain
the CBRAM devices with different AlOx IL
thicknesses (S2, S3, and S4), as shown in Table S1. For comparison, the device without AlOx IL (S1) was also fabricated. For glucose/saliva detection,
the device without an Al capping layer (S5) was fabricated. The Al
capping layer does not detect glucose because it is oxidized easily
on the surface owing to a lower Gibbs free energy of Al2O3. Therefore, the Cu TE was used, which proves also the
oxidation–reduction mechanism to detect glucose/saliva and
resistive switching. A typical Cu/AlOx/a-COx/TiNxOy/TiN structure was fabricated for glucose/saliva
detection, as shown in Figure 1a. The CBRAM structure and chemical composition of a-COx were examined by HRTEM, energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The
current–voltage (I–V) characteristics were obtained by applying sweeping bias on the
Cu TE, while the TiN BE was grounded. Memory characteristics were
measured by using an Agilent Technologies B1500 Semiconductor Device
Analyzer.

Glucose and Glucose Oxidase Preparation
For the glucose
sensing, glucose and glucose oxidase (GOx) enzyme were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. At first, 0.054 g of glucose was dissolved in 30 mL
of deionized water to obtain the 10 mM main stock solution. By dissolving
the main stock in phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4), the concentration
of the glucose solution was reduced to desired concentrations (1 pM
to 1 nM). Similarly, GOx enzyme with 110 units stock solution was
prepared by dissolving it in 500 μL of phosphate buffer solution.
The GOx enzyme with optimum concentrations of 15 and 25 units were
used for the glucose and human saliva measurements, respectively.
Finally, buffer, GOx enzyme plus different concentrated glucose from
1 pM to 1 nM were added each time to the CBRAM via-hole device and
measured current–time (I–t) response. In this case, a small sample volume of 1 μL was
used to investigate glucose/saliva in the Cu/AlOx/a-COx/TiNxOy/TiN structure. The B1500
Semiconductor Device Analyzer was used to measure current–time
(I–t) characteristics.
