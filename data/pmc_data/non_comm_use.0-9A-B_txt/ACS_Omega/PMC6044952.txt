One obstacle for practical glycosylations
is the high cost of promoters
and low-temperature equipment. This problem has been at least partially
solved by using MeSCH2Cl/KI as a low-cost promoter system.
MeSCH2Cl has an estimated cost of <$1/mol compared with
$1741/mol for AgOTf and $633/mol for TMSOTf. This new promoter system
is capable of activating various leaving groups including anomeric
Cl, F, trichloroacetimidate, and acyloxy groups. Stable and easy-to-prepare
anomeric benzoloxy carbohydrate donors were investigated in the glycosylations
of carbohydrates, aliphatic alcohols, amino acids, steroids, and nucleoside
acceptors. Most of these glycosylations were operationally simple
with fast reaction rates and moderate yields of 35–79%. In
addition, direct glycosylations of nucleosides using less than 2 equiv
of anomeric benzoloxy donors and high stereoselective mannosylation
have been achieved. From an economic point of view, this glycosylation
method should be highly applicable to industrial processes.

==== Body
Introduction
Carbohydrates play
an important role in life science1,2 and related
fields such as medicinal chemistry and pharmaceuticals3 because carbohydrate-derived drugs are used clinically
and glycosylations are an important tool in drug discovery.4 Thus, glycosylations are one of the most important
research topics in carbohydrate chemistry.5 As a result, a myriad of chemical glycosylation methods have been
developed.6−12 These methods are adapted for various glycosylation purposes by
using different pairs of catalysts or promoters with an appropriate
anomeric leaving group. Some well-known pairs include BF3/trichloroacetimidate,13 NIS-TMSOTf or
AgOTf/alkyl- or arylthio,14,15 IDCP/pentenyl,16,17 and AgOTf/halides.18 The wide variety
of leaving groups and catalyst or promoter pairs has made it possible
to carry out chemoselective glycosylations as well as multistep glycosylations
to obtain complex oligosaccharides19−21 and one-pot synthesis
of tris- or tetrasaccharides.22−24 However, it continues to be important
to further broaden the scope of leaving groups and catalyst or promoter
pairs.

Classically, when these reactions are promoted by strong
Lewis
acids such as BF325 or SnCl4,16 the acceptors used are more
than 4 equiv. However, HClO4-catalyzed glycosylations have
been reported to require only 1.2 equiv of donors.26 Most of the other research have focused on employing functionalized
acyloxy leaving groups including glycosyl phthalates,27,28 glycosyl o-methoxybenzoates,29 and glycosyl alkynylbenzoates,30,31 catalyzed by SnCl3ClO4,28 Ph3PAuOTf,30,31 PhCCH/AuCl3,32 and TMSOTf.27,29,33−36 In most of these cases, the glycoside
yields are excellent, but catalysts such as TMSOTf or AgOTf are very
expensive and moisture-sensitive, or they contaminate the products
with metals. In addition, low-temperature conditions are often required
to conduct these reactions, and this is not cost-effective in terms
of energy and equipment. These have somewhat restricted the use of
these methods, especially in the pharmaceutical industry. Our research
is aimed at the development of economic glycosylations using anomeric
acyloxy carbohydrates as donors with an inexpensive promoter. To this
end, we have developed a promoter system consisting of MeSCH2Cl/KI, which is capable of activating the anomeric benzoloxy of a
carbohydrate donor for glycosylations. The results are reported herein.

Results
and Discussion
Crystalline β-glycosyl benzoate 1a, which can
be prepared quantitatively according to our recently published method,37 was selected as the carbohydrate donor, and
lauryl alcohol (2a) was selected as the acceptor (Table 1). Cyanuric chloride-activated
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) has been investigated as a precatalyst in
several synthetic methods,38−41 and it has been shown to have Lewis acid properties.
Therefore, cyanuric chloride and DMSO were used to promote the glycosylation
between 1a and 2a in acetonitrile (MeCN)
at 80 °C. The reaction gave glycoside 3a in 10%
yield. A nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis of the reaction
product of cyanuric chloride and DMSO showed the presence of MeSCH2Cl. This compound was also reported by Knorr in the reaction
between acyl chloride and DMSO.42 On the
basis of this, a mixture of 1a and 2a (1.0
equiv each) was treated with MeSCH2Cl (2.5 equiv) and KI
(0.7 equiv) in MeCN (2 mL) at room temperature and at 45 °C,
but no glycosylations occurred (Table 1, entries 1 and 2). However, to our delight, elevating
the temperature to 80 °C produced 3a in 35% yield
(Table 1, entry 3),
and increasing the amount of glycosyl ester to 1.9 equiv raised the
yield to 46% (Table 1, entry 4). Using KI, NaI, or tetrabutyl ammonium iodide (TBAI) determined
that KI is the optimal source of I– (Table 1, entries 4–6). Various
solvents including MeCN, dichloroethane (DCE), tetrahydrofuran (THF),
toluene, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and DMSO were screened, and the
results indicated that toluene is the optimal solvent (Table 1, entries 7–12). A 73%
yield was obtained with toluene (Table 1, entry 12). Changing the amount of toluene from 1
to 4 mL did not affect the results (Table 1, entries 13 and 14). In summary, the optimized
conditions were 1.9 equiv of β-glycosyl benzoate 1a and 1.0 equiv of lauryl alcohol (2a) promoted by 2.5
equiv of MeSCH2Cl and 0.7 equiv of KI, with 4 Å molecular
sieves (MS) in toluene (2 mL) at 80 °C under N2.

a Reaction conditions: β-glucosyl
ester 1a, lauryl alcohol (2a, 1.0 equiv),
MeSCH2Cl: 2.5 equiv, KI: 0.7 equiv, and 4 Å MS under
N2 at 80 °C.

b Isolated yield.

c NR, no
reaction.

Under the optimized
condition, 11 glucosylations were performed,
among which 3 products were disaccharides (Scheme 1, 3f, 3g, and 3e). The carbohydrate acceptor with a primary hydroxyl group
gave a better yield than the acceptor with a secondary one (3f vs 3h). The yields were lower for the nitrogen-containing
(3c) and tertiary alcohol (3e) acceptors.
The best yield was achieved for 3j (79%), starting from
a steroid acceptor with a secondary hydroxyl group.

Scheme 1 Expanding the Substrate
Scope for Glucosylations Using 1.9 equiv
of Donor 1a and Promoted by MeSCH2Cl/KI
Reaction conditions: β-glucosyl
ester 1a (1.9 equiv), acceptor 2 (1.0 equiv),
MeSCH2Cl: 2.5 equiv, KI: 0.7 equiv, and 4 Å MS under
N2 at 80 °C.

These results
demonstrate that when glucosylations are promoted
by MeSCH2Cl/KI, a benzoloxy group at the anomeric center
can function as a good leaving group. The advantages of this leaving
group are its easy preparation and long-shelf life. In the glycosylations
using anomeric acyloxy as the leaving group activated by a strong
Lewis acid such as SnCl4,16 an
excess amount of a strong acid can activate the glycosidic bond of
the product, causing a substitution of the acceptor by the acetoxy
group. This can be avoided by using an excess amount of acceptor to
drive the glycosylation to completion. The high-cost problems of catalysts
for new anomeric esters developed from functionalized acids30−35 can be solved using cheap promoters/catalysts such as MeSCH2Cl/KI. MeSCH2Cl is readily prepared from the cheap
bulk chemicals cyanuric chloride and DMSO,43 a liquid with a slight garlic odor, bp 105–108 °C. The
preparation cost of MeSCH2Cl is estimated to be <$1/mol
compared with $1741/mol for AgOTf and $633/mol for TMSOTf. Therefore,
this method has obvious cost advantages.

Another advantage of
the MeSCH2Cl/KI promoter system
is that it does not activate the glycosidic bond, and as a result,
less than 2 equiv of carbohydrate donor is enough to drive the reaction
to completion.

Next, the applicability of this promoter to other
leaving groups
was explored. As shown in Scheme 2, anomeric fluoro donor 1b gave glucosylated 2f in 33% yield. Anomeric chloro donor 1c gave
a 42% yield of disaccharide 3f. Schmidt donor 1e proved to be almost as effective (61%) as anomeric benzoloxy donor 1a. Mannosyl donor β-1f with an anomeric
benzoloxy group was activated to yield 3l stereoselectively
(38%, only α-anomer). All reactions were fast (1–4.5
h). When the leaving group was Br (1d), EtS (1g), TBDMSO (1h), or OH (1i), no glycosylations
occurred. In addition, with disarmed donors, glycosylations with 2f all ended in failure. This suggests that armed and disarmed
donors can be employed orthogonally5 in
oligosaccharide synthesis when promoted by MeSCH2Cl/KI
along with other catalyst/promoter systems.

Scheme 2 Expanding the Carbohydrate
Donor Scope for Glycosylations Using 1.9
equiv of Donor 1 and Promoted by MeSCH2Cl/KI
Reaction conditions: β-glycosyl
donor 1 (1.9 equiv), acceptor 2f (1.0 equiv),
MeSCH2Cl: 2.5 equiv, KI: 0.7 equiv, and 4 Å MS under
N2 at 80 °C.

The MeSCH2Cl/KI-promoted glycosylation with the reactive
leaving group was further explored for other acceptors, and better
results were obtained using steroid 2j as the acceptor
(Scheme 3). Both glucosyl
donors 1c and 1e and mannosyl donors α-1f, β-1f, and 1o were subjected
to the conditions, and most of the yields were around 56–69%.
In the case of α-1f and β-1f, similar yields were obtained (68 and 69%). For all three cases
that started from mannosyl donors (α-1f, β-1f, and 1o), α-mannoside was stereoselectively
obtained. Other methods have been reported for the diastereoselective
synthesis of α-mannosylations,7,8 but most of
them are more expensive than this procedure. Glucosylations of tigogenin
(2k) using 1c and 1e as the
glucosyl donors delivered glucoside 3k with even better
yields (74 and 79%, respectively).

Scheme 3 Further Expanding the Carbohydrate
Donor Scope for Glycosylations
Using 2j or 2k as Acceptors Promoted by
MeSCH2Cl/KI
Reaction conditions:
β-glycosyl
ester 1 (1.9 equiv), acceptor 2j or 2k (1.0 equiv), MeSCH2Cl: 2.5 equiv, KI: 0.7 equiv,
and 4 Å MS under N2 at 80 °C.

Finally, the glycosylation acceptor scope was expanded to include
nucleosides (Scheme 4). Six glycosylated nucleosides were synthesized, including three
glucosylations and three mannosylations. Although the yields for the
nucleoside glycosylations are not high (34–47%), this represents
a practical procedure with a benzoloxy leaving group that uses less
than 2 equiv of donors. It is well-known that direct glycosylations
of nucleosides are difficult and excessive amounts of glycosyl donors
are necessary. Only one direct glycosylation of nucleosides has previously
been reported,44 which used 1.2 equiv of
the donors and was promoted by 1.5 equiv of In(OTf)3 to
give fair-to-excellent yields of nucleoside disaccharides. However,
our method has advantage in terms of cost efficiency because the cost
of In(OTf)3 is about $3855/mol compared with <$1/mol
for MeSCH2Cl. In addition, our method avoids the use of
toxic heavy metals.

Scheme 4 Direct Glycosylations of Nucleosides Promoted by MeSCH2Cl/KI
Reaction conditions: β-glycosyl
ester 1 (1.9 equiv), nucleosides 2n–2p (1.0 equiv), MeSCH2Cl: 2.5 equiv, KI: 0.7 equiv, and
4 Å MS under N2 at 80 °C.

Among the six glycosylated nucleosides, two products started from
zidovudine (AZT, a nucleoside), the first clinical drug used to treat
HIV.45 For the first time, AZT was successfully
glucosylated (3r) and mannosylated (3s).
Bioassays of these two products will be conducted.

A proposed
mechanism for glycosylation is shown in Scheme 5. Chloromethyl methyl sulfide
is in equilibrium or in resonance with sulfonium ion A, which is capable of associating with the sp2 oxygen
atom of ester 1a, but cannot effectively associate with
sp3 oxygen atoms. Intermediate B forms from
the activation of 1a by A, and then, B decomposes to D and glycosyl cation C. Trapping glycosyl cation C with the carbohydrate acceptor
ROH leads to glycoside 3. The reason that more than 2
equiv of chloromethyl methyl sulfide is required is probably because
more BzOCH2SMe (E) is formed from D than from A, and/or the formation of E is irreversible. Therefore, only some of the chloromethyl methyl
sulfide functions as the catalyst, and the majority acts as a promoter.

Scheme 5 Proposed Mechanism for the Glycosylation Promoted by MeSCH2Cl/KI
To support the SN1-like mechanism involving C (Scheme 5),46 a set of
reactions between lauryl alcohol and
glycosyl ester α/β-1a (α/β =
1:2.1) and α/β-1p (α/β = 1:2.3)
were conducted (Scheme 6). The two glycosylations resulted in similar α/β ratios
(3:1 vs 2.7:1) in diasteroeselectivity, reaction yields (70 vs 72%),
and reaction times (4 vs 3 h). This indicates that anomeric benzoloxy
and acetoxy function as leaving groups in similar ways. The faster
reaction rate of α/β-1p (compared with α/β-1a) suggests that sulfonium ion A is a weak Lewis
acid (Scheme 5) that
activates the stronger Lewis base α/β-1p more
efficiently. To our knowledge, a sulfonium ion has never been reported
as a Lewis acid, although Lewis acid phosphonium and siliconium ions
are known.47 It was reported that the formation
of the side product thioacetal from the alcohol oxidation by activated
DMSO is attributed to the addition of alcohol to sulfonium ion A.48

Scheme 6 Glucosylations of
α/β Donor Mixtures Promoted by MeSCH2Cl/KI
Reaction conditions: β-glucosyl
ester 1 (1.9 equiv), lauryl alcohol (2a,
1.0 equiv), MeSCH2Cl: 2.5 equiv, KI: 0.7 equiv, and 4 Å
MS under N2 at 80 °C.

Similar
results for pure β-1a (Scheme 1) and α/β-1a (Scheme 6) indicate that mixed
acyloxy anomers can be used as carbohydrate
donors without the need for separation. This is also supported by
the similar performance of mannosyl donors α-1f and β-1f with acceptor 2f (Scheme 2). This means that
α/β glycosyl ester donor mixtures, which are much easier
to prepare than their single anomer counterparts, are applicable to
this procedure.

In summary, cost-effective glycosylation reactions
with a broad
spectrum of anomeric leaving groups have been achieved using a new
promoter. This organo-promoter system can replace many expensive catalysts,
some of which contain toxic heavy metals. This promoter is capable
of facilitating glycosylations with anomeric benzoloxy donors on various
acceptors. A notable result is the first direct glycosylation of a
nucleoside using a benzoloxy leaving group in a cost-effective and
heavy metal-free way. This practical method is attractive to industries
for reducing the costs of expensive catalysts and low-temperature
equipment. The mechanism of glycosylation has been discussed.

General Information
Commercially available reagents
were used without further purification. The starting materials 1a,371c–1o,49−572c,582f,592g,542h,602n–2o,54 and MeSCH2Cl43 were prepared according to the literature. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded with a
400 or 600 MHz spectrometer using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal
standard. Chemical shifts (δ) are reported relative to TMS (1H) or CDCl3 (13C). High-resolution mass
spectra (HRMS) were recorded on a quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF)
mass analyzer using electrospray ionization (ESI).

Procedure for
the Synthesis of 1a
A mixture
of 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-benzyl-α-d-glucopyranosyl
chloride (300 mg), benzoic acid (1.05 equiv, 69 mg), Cs2CO3 (0.51 equiv, 89 mg), tetrabutyl ammonium bromide (TBAB,
0.05 equiv, 9 mg), and granular polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) sand
(5 g) was mechanically stirred (400 rpm) at 80 °C for 2 min,
followed by the addition of water (10 equiv, 97 mg). Initially, the
reaction media appeared as thick milk, and it gradually turned to
a semisolid that adhered to the glass. After thin-layer chromatography
(TLC) indicated completion of the reaction, ethyl acetate (2 ×
10 mL) was added to extract the crude product, which was washed with
5% aqueous Na2CO3 (1 × 10 mL) and water
(1 × 10 mL) and dried over Na2SO4. Concentration
under reduced pressure gave 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-benzyl-β-d-glucopyranosyl benzoate 1a (351 mg, >99%).

General Procedure for Glycosylation Using the Glycosylation
of 2a as an Example
To a solution of 2a (0.5 mmol, 93 mg) in dry toluene (2 mL) were added 1a (0.95 mmol, 612 mg), MeSCH2Cl (2.5 mmol, 120 mg), KI
(0.35 mmol, 58 mg), and 4 Å MS. The mixture was stirred at 80
°C under N2 (monitored by TLC). After completion,
the reaction mixture was quenched with 5% aqueous Na2CO3 (10 mL) and extracted with dichloromethane (DCM) (2 ×
10 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with water (10 mL)
and brine (10 mL), dried over Na2SO4, and evaporated
under vacuum. The residue was purified by chromatography to yield 3a (89 mg, 73%).
