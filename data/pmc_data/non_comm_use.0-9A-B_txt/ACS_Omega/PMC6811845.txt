Anion-exchange membrane
fuel cells (AEMFCs) are promising technologies
that allow the use of nonprecious metals as catalysts because the
oxidation reduction reaction at the cathode occurs readily at the
high pH of AEMFCs. However, the insufficient chemical stability of
the anion-conductive materials in AEMFCs currently limits their development.
We studied the chemical stability of the electrolyte in the catalyst
layer of AEMFCs containing cationic dimethyl polybenzimidazole (mPBI).
Although degradation was observed in an mPBI membrane under alkaline
conditions, mPBI coated on a carbon support showed excellent alkaline
stability. Because no glass transition temperature was observed for
mPBI after coating on the support, the increase of chemical stability
was probably associated with the decrease of polymer flexibility.

1 Introduction
Polymer
electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) have been recognized as
promising power generation systems because of their high energy conversion
efficiency, high power density, compactness, and low pollutant emission.1−3 Proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) using proton-conductive
polymers are the main types of PEFCs because of the ready availability
of proton-conductive electrolytes containing anionic groups such as
Nafion. A major drawback of PEMFCs is the low stability of the metal
catalysts under their highly acidic operating conditions, which limits
the catalyst to expensive platinum (Pt) nanoparticles.4 To avoid this problem, increasing attention has been focused
on anion-exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs)3,5−7 using cationic electrolytes. The basic environment
of AEMFCs is tolerated by various metal catalysts and also promotes
the redox reactions of oxygen.5,8−10 Therefore, AEMFCs represent an approach to lower the cost of fuel
cells by replacing the Pt catalyst with other less expensive metals.

Polymers with cationic groups such as guanidinium,11 sulfonium,12 pyridinium, imidazolium,13 piperidinium,14 and
phosphonium15,16 have been developed as AEMFC
electrolytes. Quaternary ammonium cations are used the most often
in this role because of their ease of synthesis and higher thermal
stability than those of other cations with comparable anion conductivity.17,18 The most critical issue in the development of AEMFCs is the chemical
instability of the cationic electrolyte,16,18−23 which typically occurs via the SN2 reaction, Hofmann
elimination, and nucleophilic addition triggered by the OH– attack. Recently, systematic studies to correlate the chemical stability
and chemical structures of cationic groups have been conducted,13 and several new membrane structures have been
proposed.13,24

These studies mainly focused on the
stability of the anion-exchange
membrane (AEM); the alkaline stability of the electrolyte in the catalyst
layer has not yet been studied. In the catalyst layer, the electrolyte
is mixed with carbon materials, which may result in a different morphology
from the AEM because of electrolyte adsorption on the carbon surface.
In a PEMFC, the polymer electrolyte, typically Nafion, adsorbs on
the surface of the electrocatalyst,25 and
formation of phase-separated structures is suppressed because of the
strong influence of the carbon surface.26 As a result, the polymer electrolyte possesses lower proton conductivity27 and lower water uptake28 than those of a bulk film. The structure and properties of the polymer
electrolyte in the catalyst layer of an AEMFC have not been studied
to date in detail.29,30 The alkaline stability of the
electrolyte in the catalyst layer may be different from that of the
AEM in an AEMFC.

In this study, the cationic polymer dimethyl
polybenzimidazole
(mPBI) is used to study the alkaline stability in the catalyst layer
because mPBI is a promising candidate for use as the membrane in AEMFCs
due to its high anionic conductivity.31 Another reason for the choice of mPBI is that we found that PBI
derivatives strongly and homogeneously adsorbed on the surface of
the carbon support such as multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) to
give PBI-wrapped MWNTs (MWNT/PBI) and provided good anchoring sites
for Pt loading on the MWNT surface.32 Thus,
Pt nanoparticles are immobilized on the surface of MWNT/mPBI to give
an electrocatalyst (denoted as MWNT/mPBI/Pt). Alkaline stability of
the MWNT/mPBI as well as MWNT/mPBI/Pt was investigated by comparing
the structure of mPBI after soaking into alkaline solution. It is
noted that the use of MWNTs offers a strong measurement advantage
when observing the stability of mPBI by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) owing to the good crystallinity of MWNTs. The polarization behavior
of the electrocatalyst was also characterized using a membrane electrode
assembly (MEA) to check the anion conduction of mPBI in the catalyst
layer.

2 Results and Discussion
PBI was methylated
using methyl iodide to afford mPBI, as shown
in Scheme 1.33 In the 1H NMR spectrum of mPBI, the
signal from the N–H proton of PBI at 13.32 ppm disappeared,
and signals from N–CH3 protons at 4.08 and 4.16
ppm appeared (Supporting Information, Figure S1a). Based on the integral ratio of aromatic protons (7.5 to 9.0 ppm)
to methyl protons (4.2 ppm), the methylation yield was determined
to be 91.8%. Methylation of PBI was also confirmed by FT-IR spectroscopy,
which showed a new peak originating from N–CH3 at
1015 cm–1 (Supporting Information, Figure S1b). In XPS narrow scans of the N 1s region, the N+–C peak at 400.9 eV was newly observed, while the N–C
and N=C peaks at 399.5 and 398.2 eV remained, respectively, indicating
the formation of the imidazole cation (Supporting Information, Figure S1c). MWNTs were dispersed in mPBI solution
in DMAc by sonication. Although the MWNTs did not disperse well in
DMAc without mPBI, including mPBI in the DMAc solution led to effective
MWNT dispersion (Scheme 2), suggesting that mPBI was adsorbed on the MWNTs and served as a
dispersant, similar to the MWNT dispersion behavior of PBI.32 The MWNTs were then collected by filtration
or precipitation to control the amount of polyelectrolyte (mPBI) around
the MWNTs. In the filtration method, the MWNT dispersion was directly
filtered, and then the obtained composite (MWNT/mPBI) was washed with
DMAc to remove unbound mPBI, giving MWNTs with a coating of a thin
layer of mPBI (denoted as MWNT/mPBI-w). In the precipitation method,
the MWNT dispersion was precipitated in diethyl ether using a controlled
injection rate of 2.0 mL min–1 and then collected
by filtration (denoted as MWNT/mPBI-p).

and -p
Composition ratios of MWNTs
to mPBI in the samples were determined
by TGA. In TGA measured under air flow, weight loss caused by the
thermal decomposition of mPBI starting at around 200 °C was observed,
as depicted in Figure 1a. Based on the observed weight losses, it is estimated that MWNT/mPBI-w
and MWNT/mPBI-p contained 6.6 and 42.0 wt % mPBI, respectively. Assuming
the uniform coating of mPBI on the MWNTs, the thicknesses of the mPBI
layers in MWNT/mPBI-w and MWNT/mPBI-p were calculated to be 0.3 and
8.2 nm, respectively, using the surface area of MWNTs (53.7 m2 g–1) determined by nitrogen adsorption
measurements. Coating of the MWNTs with mPBI was confirmed by TEM
measurements. TEM images of MWNT/mPBI-w and MWNT/mPBI-p clearly showed
the highly crystalline periodic layered structure together with the
amorphous thin layer on the surface in which we assigned the MWNT
and mPBI, respectively, based on TGA results (Figure 1a). The measured thicknesses of the mPBI
layers were 0.3 ± 0.1 (Figure 1b) and 8.3 ± 0.3 nm (Figure 1c) for MWNT/mPBI-w and MWNT/mPBI-p, respectively.

The alkaline stabilities of MWNT/mPBI-w and MWNT/mPBI-p together
with that of the mPBI powder were tested by immersing the materials
in 0.01 M KOH solution under gentle shaking for 48 h. Typically, 1H NMR spectroscopy is used to monitor the alkaline stability
of ammonium or imidazolium cations.13 In
this work, because monitoring the stability by 1H NMR spectroscopy
was rather difficult due to the insolubility of mPBI/MWNTs and the
low mobility of mPBI on MWNT, the degradation was monitored by XPS.
In the N 1s scans, peaks assignable to N+–C, N–C,
and N=C were observed at 400.9, 399.5, and 398.2 eV, respectively
(Figure 2).34,35 In the case of the mPBI powder, relative areas of N–C and
N=C peaks largely increased, and that of the N+–C
peak decreased compared with that of the other samples (Figure 2a, see also the Supporting
Information, Table S1a), which indicated
the loss of the cation group through the SN2 reaction,
as explained in Scheme S1. It is noted
that only some of the mPBI powder dissolved and the XPS measurements
were obtained from the residual powder. Loss of the methyl group and
the increase of the N=C peak intensity were also supported by FT-IR
spectroscopy (Supporting Information, Figure S2). For the mPBI film, soaking the film in 0.01 M KOH solution resulted
in the decomposition of the film into small pieces after 24 h (Figure 2b), suggesting that
the degradation of the mPBI main chain via a hydrolysis reaction followed
by ring cleavage to the diamine and carboxylic acid occurred as proposed.15,36,37 Conversely, the XPS profiles
for both MWNT/mPBI-w (Figure 2c, see also the Supporting Information, Table S1b) and MWNT/mPBI-p (Figure 2d) were almost unchanged even after 48 h
of immersion in KOH solution. In addition, TEM observations revealed
that the thickness of the mPBI layer on the MWNT surface was almost
unchanged for both MWNT/mPBI-w (0.3 ± 0.1 nm, Figure 2e) and MWNT/mPBI-p (7.9 ±
0.3 nm, Figure 2f)
after immersion in KOH, which also supported the alkaline stability
of the mPBI layer on MWNTs.

Thomas et al.22 reported
that introduction
of steric hindrance into the PBI structure improved its alkaline stability.
Based on this model, it is speculated that the MWNTs provided steric
hindrance to suppress the SN2 reaction. Such a mechanism
can occur at the interface of the MWNTs and mPBI, but it cannot explain
the increased alkaline stability of mPBI located far from the MWNT
surface, especially for MWNT/mPBI-p with a thick mPBI coating. XPS
analysis revealed that the I 3d peak at around 620 eV observed for
mPBI disappeared after KOH treatment for both MWNT/mPBI-w and MWNT/mPBI-p
(Supporting Information, Figure S3). This
result indicates that hydroxide ions (OH–) penetrated
into the mPBI layer and replaced the iodide ions during KOH treatment
regardless of the thickness of the mPBI coating. Therefore, the steric
effect of MWNTs was probably not the reason for the increased alkaline
stability of MWNT/mPBI compared with that of mPBI.

We suppose
that such unexpected stability was achieved because
the polymer mobility was lowered by coating on the MWNTs and both
the SN2 and hydrolysis reactions were effectively suppressed
by the hardening of the polymer. It is well recognized that the properties
of a polymer on a substrate, such as the glass transition temperature
(Tg),38 thermal
expansion,39 segment dynamics,40 viscosity,41 and
water uptake,42 are strongly affected by
the polymer/substrate interactions. When the polymer/substrate interfacial
interaction is strong, Tg tends to increase,43,44 which suggests that the conformation of the polymer chains at the
polymer/substrate interface is frozen and relaxation occurs more slowly
than that in the bulk polymer. In the case of carbon nanotube (CNT)/polymer
composites, Tg at the CNT/polymer interface
has not been studied yet, but the increase of Tg of CNT/polymer composites compared with that of the polymer
alone has often been reported,45−48 strongly suggesting that the increase of Tg at the CNT/polymer interface is accompanied
by the lowering of the polymer mobility at this interface. To investigate
the hardening of the polymer at the MWNT/mPBI interface, we used PBI
with a Tg of around 410 °C33,49 instead of mPBI because mPBI did not show a Tg peak below its thermal decomposition temperature (>230
°C, Figure 1a).33

Figure 3 shows the
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) profiles of PBI (red line)
and MWNT/PBI (black line). We found that MWNT/PBI did not display
a Tg peak at 407 °C from PBI. This
is probably caused by the hardening of PBI induced by coating on the
MWNTs, which shifted Tg above the thermal
decomposition temperature of PBI (about 450 °C), as reported
for other composite systems.45−48 We assumed that such a hardening of PBI also occurred
in the case of mPBI on the MWNT surface and the chemical reactions
associated with the volume change might become unfavorable. Such a
hardening might also decrease the water uptake of mPBI, resulting
in the lower reactivity of the polymer and realizing the longer stability.
Similar enhanced alkaline stability was also achieved when carbon
black was used as the carbon support instead of MWNTs (see the Supporting
Information, Figure S4).

Figure 3 DSC curves of PBI (red)
and MWNT/PBI (black).

Thus, to achieve enhanced
alkaline stability, we concluded that
the coating of the polymer electrolyte on the solid surface needs
to form a strong interaction with the surface and that stability can
be increased by adsorption on a support regardless of the inherent
alkaline stability of the polymer electrolyte.

The MWNT/mPBI-w
was loaded with Pt using a polyol method with H2PtCl6 as a Pt source and EG as a reducing agent.32,50 The inset in Figure 4a shows a TEM image of the obtained composite (MWNT/mPBI/Pt). The
Pt nanoparticles with a narrow diameter distribution (3.2 ± 0.5
nm) were homogeneously loaded on the MWNTs (see the Supporting Information, Figure S5). TGA indicated that 45 wt % Pt was
loaded on the MWNT/mPBI/Pt composite (Figure 4a), suggesting effective growth of the Pt
nanoparticles on MWNT/mPBI-w.32,51 An MEA containing 1.0
M KOH-doped MWNT/mPBI/Pt as the electrocatalyst was fabricated on
both sides of a commercially available membrane (A2013; Tokuyama)
as an anion-conductive membrane. We used an A2013 membrane because
of its higher stability (Supporting Information, Figure S6) than that of mPBI (Figure 2b). As shown in Figure 4b, the polarization curve measured at 50
°C under 100% RH showed a power density of 24.6 mW cm–2 (red curve), whereas that of the control MEA containing MWNT/mPBI/Pt
without KOH doping was only 9.71 mW cm–2 (black
curve). The above comparison clearly indicates that the KOH-doped
mPBI layer functioned as an anion-conductive electrolyte in the catalyst
layer. This is the first example to demonstrate mPBI serving as the
electrocatalyst. It is important to note that MWNT/mPBI/Pt showed
excellent alkaline stability after KOH doping, similar to that MWNT/mPBI,
which was confirmed by XPS (see the Supporting Information, Figure S7). The above results suggest the possibility
of developing AEMFCs with excellent alkaline durability if we have
durable AEMs. To check the durability of MWNT/mPBI in an MEA, development
of an AEM with excellent durability is necessary where the tests will
be conducted with high KOH concentration (>1.0 M) under practical
temperature (>60 °C).

3 Conclusions
We studied the alkaline stability of a
polymer electrolyte in the
catalyst layer of an AEMFC using mPBI-coated MWNTs with different
coating thicknesses of 0.3 to 8.3 nm by soaking the composites in
0.01 M KOH solution. Degradation of MWNT/mPBI was monitored by XPS,
which showed that the mPBI coated on MWNTs was remarkably stable,
whereas an mPBI film and mPBI powder underwent rapid degradation under
the same conditions. Lowering of polymer flexibility upon coating
on the MWNTs might suppress the elimination reaction induced by the
OH– attack. Our novel findings provide important
knowledge for not only catalyst layer design but also development
of novel alkali-stable membranes.

an Exstar TG/DTA6300 analyzer (Seiko Instruments, Inc.) at a heating
rate of 10 °C min–1 under an air flow of 200
mL min–1. Scanning transmission electron microscopy
(STEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were

were conducted on a Belsorp mini analyzer (BEL Japan, Inc.) after
pretreatment at 300 °C for 12 h under high vacuum.

4.3 Synthesis of mPBI
PBI containing
23.4% DMAc (9.07 g) was dissolved in DMAc (300 mL) at 80 °C in
a 500 mL flask, and then NaH (1.5 g, 2.1 mmol) was added at room temperature.
The solution turned dark red after heating at 80 °C for 6 h.
After cooling the solution to room temperature, CH3I (9.3
mL, 4.2 mmol) was added, and then the mixture was heated at 80 °C
for 20 h. The obtained solid was collected by a polytetrafluoroethylene
filter with a pore diameter of 3.0 μm and rinsed with DMAc and
methanol. After drying at 100 °C for 12 h, a yellow powder (14.2

4.6 MEA Fabrication
MWNT/mPBI/Pt was
dispersed in 1.0 M KOH solution (40 mL) by sonication and shaken for
24 h at 25 °C. The solid material was collected by filtration
and then washed with water. The obtained solid was dispersed in isopropanol
(120 mL) by sonication and then transferred onto a gas diffusion layer
(Sigracet GDL 25 BC, SGL Carbon Group) by vacuum filtration. The gas
diffusion layer was used as a filter to produce a gas-diffusion electrode
