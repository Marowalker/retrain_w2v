Single-chamber microbial fuel cells
(MFCs) were constructed using
rice bran (carbon source) and pond bottom mud (microbial source).
The total electric charge obtained in the MFC combining rice bran
with pond bottom mud was four times higher than that in MFC using
only rice bran. Phylogenetic analyses revealed dominant growth of
fermentative bacteria such as Bacteroides and Clostridium species, and exoelectrogenic Geobacter species in the anode biofilms, suggesting
that mutualism of these bacteria is a key factor for effective electricity
generation in the MFC. Furthermore, rice bran, consisting of persistent
polysaccharide, was pretreated by the hydrodynamic cavitation system
to improve the digestibility and enhance the efficiency in MFC, resulting
in 26% increase in the total production of electricity.

1 Introduction
Microbial fuel cells (MFCs)
are promising for energy recovery and
electricity generation from organic compounds using microbes as electrocatalysts.1,2 Because of the large variation in microbial metabolisms, many different
organic compounds can be used as a substrate for electricity generation
in MFCs.3−5 Many studies have applied MFCs to organic compounds
derived from food wastes, such as a brewery wastewater,6 cheese whey,7 yogurt
waste,8 and palm oil mill effluent.9 Food waste is useful for electricity generation
in MFCs because it is rich in organic compounds that can be assimilated
by microbes. However, most of the above studies used liquid food waste
and few studies have focused on the solid food waste as a substrate
for MFCs. Solid organic compounds are promising substrates for electricity
generation in MFCs because they have higher energy density than soluble
organic compounds.3

Rice bran is
a major by-product of rice milling.10 About
600 million tons of rice is harvested worldwide annually,
and rice bran accounts for 7% of the mass of rice.11 Rice bran has been used for oil production, animal feed,
fertilizer, and in industrial applications.12 Recently, rice bran has attracted much attention as a functional
food because it contains bioactive ingredients, such as polysaccharides,
proteins, minerals, and other micronutrients.10 Rice bran is a potential source material for MFCs because of its
rich nutrient and organic compounds.13

However, one problem in the use of solid biomass for MFCs is low
digestibility. Rice bran contains cellulose, which has a crystalline
structure and is difficult to degrade. Thus, pretreatment of solid
biomass is necessary for efficient degradation by microbes in a MFC.
Ultrasonication causes cavitation in a solution, triggering a hotspot
generation with localized extreme temperature and pressure.14 Ultrasonication has been used to improve the
performance of sludge-based MFC for the purpose of pretreatment of
the sludge15,16 and removal of the biofilm17 by the action of the localized high energy.
A flowing fluid system also gives cavitation, which is called hydrodynamic
cavitation. Cavitation is generated in a flow of fluid passing through
a venturi tube or an orifice plate with a constriction, resulting
in hotspot generation.18 Application of
hydrodynamic cavitation has been investigated in various fields including
food industry and water treatment.19 We
have recently developed a biomass pretreatment technique using hydrodynamic
cavitation with low energy input and demonstrated a higher pretreatment
efficiency compared to ultrasonication.20

In the present study, electricity was generated from solid
rice
bran using mud from the bottom of a pond as a bacterial source. A
single chamber MFC equipped with an air cathode was constructed. For
electric generation without stirring, an anode was attached to the
bottom of the MFC reactor, where solid compounds decomposed and electrons
collected. The use of hydrodynamic cavitation pretreatment of solid
rice bran for electricity generation was examined.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Electricity Generation
Using Rice Bran in
MFCs
Electricity generation test was conducted using an MFC
system shown in Figure 1. The voltage was measured for each MFC (MFC-1, MFC-2, and MFC-3)
during operation (Figure 2). Initially, the voltage was low in all cases. The voltage
in MFC-1 (rice bran + bottom mud) increased gradually after day 7.
Rice bran contains macromolecular biopolymers such as cellulose, which
are gradually degraded to low-molecular-weight compounds by microbes
around the anode to be assimilated, resulting in a gradual increase
in the voltage. The higher voltage (325 mV) was achieved on day 15,
and then it began to decrease. After additional rice bran was supplied
to MFC-1 on day 20, two peaks showing sharp rise and drastic decline
in the voltage were observed. The first peak would be attributed to
the voltage increase by the assimilation of low-molecular weight compounds
such as sugars and amino acids in additionally supplied biomass. The
second peak could be because of the electricity generation from degradation
products of oligomers such as oligosaccharides and/or peptides. Subsequently,
the increase in the voltage was observed again after 30 days, probably
due to the degradation of macromolecular compounds such as cellulose
and proteins. In contrast, the voltage for MFC-2 (rice bran) was quite
low. In this system, some degradation and redox reactions catalyzed
by microbes would occur moderately on the anode and the cathode even
though the main microbial source (bottom mud) was not added in MFC-2.
The voltage for MFC-3 (bottom mud) was negligible (average voltage
2.45 mV) throughout the experiment, suggesting that microbes could
not grow and generate electricity in this MFC because of the lack
of organic compounds in the electrolyte. The lowest internal resistance
and total electric charge are shown in Table 1. MFC-1 had lower internal resistance (298.7
Ω) than MFC-2 (1786 Ω) and MFC-3 (9710 Ω). Furthermore,
the total electric charge with MFC-1 (1.58 × 103 C)
was more than four times that of MFC-2 (3.69 × 102 C), indicating that MFC-1 performed the best among the three MFCs.
On the basis of these results, both rice bran and bottom mud are important
in our MFC system for electricity generation, where they provide organic
compounds and effective biocatalysis, respectively. In terms of power
density, we obtained maximum power density of 16.5 mW/m2 in MFC-1. Previous works reported power density of 4.2,21 10,22 67,23 37,24 436 mW/m23 using cattle waste, and 360 mW/m2 using rice bran,13 where paddy
field soil was used as a microbial source. The actual value of power
density would be significantly and susceptibly affected by several
factors such as the performance of anode and cathode including the
efficiency of metal catalyst, types of substrate (i.e. biomass or
organic compounds), and microbial source and community employed in
the system. As for the types of substrate, electricity generation
would be improved by the treatment of biomass as shown in the latter
part.

rice bran was supplemented to each MFC at the point indicated by the
arrow in the same color.

MFC-3	9710	2.04 × 101	
2.2 Phylogenetic Compositions of Bacteria
Phylogenetic compositions of bacteria in the original rice bran,
bottom mud, and anode biofilms of MFC-1 were determined (Figure 3). Chloroplasts made
up 88% of the rice bran, and were detected using the amplified 16S
rRNA gene. Thus, bacteria in the class Alphaproteobacteria (10.8%) were predominant in the original rice bran. In the original
bottom mud, bacteria in the class Betaproteobacteria (18.0%) were dominant as well as the classes Deltaproteobacteria (16.3%) and Alphaproteobacteria (14.7%).
In the anode biofilms, bacteria in the classes Bacteroidia (27.5%) and Clostridia (21.4%) were
enriched compared with the levels in the original bottom mud. Among
the bacteria in the class Bacteroidia, the most predominant genus was Bacteroides (37.1% of the class Bacteroidia).
Some bacteria belonging to the genus Bacteroides are anaerobic glycolytic bacteria that can produce organic acids
such as acetate and succinate.25 The bacteria
in the Clostridia class were mainly
in the genus Clostridium (61.7%). Many
kinds of Clostridium species are known
to be able to decompose cellulosic materials to oligo- and mono-saccharides
under anaerobic conditions,3 suggesting
that they would play an important role in decomposing high-molecular-weight
compounds in rice bran to low-molecular-weight compounds in the MFC
systems. Followed by bacteria in the classes Bacteroidia and Clostridia, bacteria in the class Deltaproteobacteria (13.2%) were enriched in the
anode biofilms, as was the case with original bottom mud (16.3%).
Among the bacteria in the class Deltaproteobacteria, 88.0% belonged to the genus Geobacter. The genus Geobacter are exoelectrogenic bacteria
which use organic acids as a substrate and can directly transfer electrons
to electrodes without a mediator.26,27 This suggests
that bacteria in the genus Geobacter are crucial for voltage generation in MFCs. Furthermore, a recent
study reported phenol-degrading MFCs with graphite electrodes, where Geobacter sp. is working as a phenol degrader in
the anode biofilm.28 Therefore, Geobacter sp. could possibly degrade polyphenolic
compounds in the rice bran to generate electricity in our MFC system.
On the basis of these results, we hypothesize the following concerted
electric generation system; the genus Clostridium degrades polymeric cellulose in rice bran to glucose, some of which
is converted to organic acids by the genus Bacteroides and/or are directly converted to organic acids by anaerobic Clostridium such as Clostridium butylicum. Finally, these organic acids are used for electron transfer to
the electrode by the genus Geobacter. The degrading, fermentative, and exoelectrogenic bacteria would
cooperatively and sequentially function for effective electricity
generation in the MFC system using rice bran and bottom mud.

mud, and (C) anode biofilms of MFC-1.

2.3 Effect of Hydrodynamic Cavitation Pretreatment
of Rice Bran on the MFC Performance
Because rice bran contains
a large quantity of biopolymer such as cellulose, these biopolymers
should be altered to be easily digested by microbes in the MFC system.
To improve the digestibility of biomass, pretreatment is the most
powerful tool. We thus examine pretreatment of biomass by hydrodynamic
cavitation, which was found to be efficient for the pretreatment of
lignocellulosic biomass.20Figure 4A shows the photos of untreated
and pretreated rice bran by hydrodynamic cavitation. Swelling of the
rice bran was observed after the pretreatment compared to the untreated.
The powder X-ray diffraction pattern of the untreated sample (Figure 4B) showed a characteristic
peak for crystalline cellulose at around θ = 22°.29 This peak was significantly decreased after
hydrodynamic cavitation pretreatment, which indicated that the cellulose
crystallinity of the rice bran decreased by the treatment. Hot spots
with high temperature and high pressure are generated locally in a
hydrodynamic cavitation system.18 This
would lead to disruption of hydrogen-bond in cellulose in the biomass,
resulting in decrease in crystallinity.

Figure 4 (A) Photographs and (B)
powder X-ray diffraction patterns of rice
bran without pretreatment and pretreated by hydrodynamic cavitation
(at 30 °C for 1 h).

Figure 5 shows
the
voltage of MFC-4 (untreated) and MFC-5 (pretreated by hydrodynamic
cavitation). MFC-5 (213 mV on day 10) gave higher voltage than MFC-4
(158 mV on day 11). The total electric charges obtained with MFC-4
and MFC-5 were 4.91 × 102 and 6.19 × 102 C, respectively (Table 2), indicating hydrodynamic cavitation increased the total
electric charge by 26%. Pretreatment of rice bran by hydrodynamic
cavitation would increase the digestibility of the biomass by microbes
around the anode, which leads to higher efficiency in electric generation
in MFC-5. Pretreatment of biomass was demonstrated to be also important
in the MFC system.

3 Conclusions
We constructed
the MFC system using rice bran and pond bottom mud.
Electricity generation from rice bran was significantly improved by
employing pond bottom mud as the microbial source. Cooperative action
of Clostridium, Bacteroides, and Geobacter species would be quite
important in a sequential biological process that includes degradation
of biopolymers, conversion of saccharides to organic acids, and electricity
generation on anode. Furthermore, the pretreatment of rice bran by
hydrodynamic cavitation apparently increased the efficiency of MFC.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 MFC Construction
A carbon-felt anode
(9 cm × 9 cm, 0.5 mm thick; Sogo Carbon, Kanagawa, Japan) was
attached to the bottom of a plastic case (10 cm × 10 cm ×
8 cm) with silicone sealant. The air cathode contained a carbon cloth
(EC-CC1-06; Electrochem, Inc., MA, USA) modified with polytetrafluoroethylene
(Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC., MO, USA) layers and a carbon base layer of
carbon powder (Vulcan XC-72, MOUBIC INC., Shizuoka, Japan) plus polytetrafluoroethylene
on one side, and a platinum carbon layer (TEC10E40E; Tanaka Kikinzoku
Kogyo, Tokyo, Japan) on the opposite side (Figure 1A). A small window (8 cm × 3 cm) was
cut out of the side of the plastic case for placement of the air cathode
(Figure 1B).

4.2 MFC Operation Using Rice Bran
Rice
bran (Mori Sangyo Co., Ltd, Hokkaido, Japan) was stored in a refrigerator
at 4 °C until required. Bottom mud was collected from Ono pond
(Hokkaido University, Hokkaido, Japan) and used as an inoculum. We
examined three MFC systems, MFC-1 (rice bran 4.0 g and bottom mud
12 g in 500 mL of distilled water), MFC-2 (rice bran 4.0 g in 500
mL of distilled water), and MFC-3 (bottom mud 12 g in 500 mL of distilled
water). The three MFCs were connected to an external resistance of
510 Ω and left in an incubator at a constant temperature (30 °C)
to avoid variation in MFC efficiency caused by temperature change.
The voltage (V) was measured at 10 min intervals
using a data logger (GL240; Graphtec, Tokyo, Japan). Additional rice
bran (1.3 g) was added to MFC-1 and MFC-2 when the voltage decreased.
The internal resistance (r) was calculated from the
external resistance (R), recorded voltage (V), and current (I = V/R) according to an established method.4 Maximum power density was obtained from power
curve (current I vs power P = I·V). The total electric charge (Q) was calculated from the voltage measurement interval
(t) and average current for this interval (I′) as Q = ∑(I′ × t).30

4.3 Phylogenetic Analysis of Bacterial Communities
Phylogenetic analysis of bacterial communities was conducted by
Repertoire Genesis Inc. (Osaka, Japan). Briefly, genome DNA was extracted
from each sample (rice bran, bottom mud, and anode biofilm) and used
as a template for PCR amplification of 16S rRNA gene fragments (V1–V2
region). The amplicon was analyzed by MiSeq next-generation sequencer
(Illumina, Inc., CA, USA). Phylogenetic analyses were performed using
Flora Genesis database.

4.4 Pretreatment of Rice Bran
by Hydrodynamic
Cavitation
A hydrodynamic cavitation system was constructed
according to a previous study.20 A Venturi
tube with a throat diameter of 1.4 mm was used in this experiment.
Rice bran was screened to obtain particles of size ranging from 75
to 200 μm. Rice bran (4 g) was suspended in 400 mL of 0.1 mol/L
NaOH solution in a holding tank. Hydrodynamic cavitation pretreatment
was carried out by circulating the suspension with diaphragm pump
(Duplex II AC Demand Pump D3635E7011A, FLOJET, 50 W; CA, USA) at a
flow rate of 1.8 L/min in a water bath (30 °C, 1 h). The pretreated
sample was neutralized with 2 mol/L HCl. For comparison, an untreated
sample was prepared by adding rice bran to a neutralized solution
with the same salinity. We examined two MFC systems, which we labeled
MFC-4 (untreated), and MFC-5 (pretreated by hydrodynamic cavitation),
both containing bottom mud (12 g) as a microbial source. The experimental
conditions were the same as described above. On day 18, 250 mL of
biomass suspension in each MFC was replaced with 250 mL of a fresh
suspension of rice bran prepared under the same conditions.

Powder X-ray diffraction was used to observe changes in the crystalline
structure after pretreatment. Samples with hydrodynamic cavitation
pretreatment and no pretreatment were dried at 90 °C for 24 h
and scanned with an X-ray diffractometer (MultiFlex 2 kW; Rigaku,
Tokyo, Japan) at 2θ = 5–30°. The scan speed was
1°/min, and the step size was 0.02°.
