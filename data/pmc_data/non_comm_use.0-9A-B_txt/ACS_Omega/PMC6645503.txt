In this work, the
structural and electronic properties of perylene
tetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI) derivative molecules have been calculated
using density functional theory simulations. Here, we have obtained
the equilibrium geometry for certain PTCDI derivatives and calculated
their occupied and unoccupied density of states separately for molecular
orbitals lying in-plane (σ type) and orthogonal to the plane
(π type) of the molecules. We have also simulated the X-ray
absorption spectroscopy (XAS) spectra for these molecules separately
for π- and σ-type orbitals. A comparison between the unoccupied
density of states and XAS data has been made because both provide
a description of the molecular orbitals above the Fermi level. We
have observed the presence of shallow-lying σ orbitals in twisted
molecules and have obtained an almost linear relationship between
the abundance of these orbitals and the degree of molecular twist.
Additionally, we have shown the possibility of an experimentally viable
stereoisomerism in PTCDI-C3.

1 Introduction
Organic electronic technologies
are emerging as prospective future
options in recent years owing to their high application potential
in electronic devices.1−11 Organic semiconductors are a class of organic solids, usually molecular
crystals, amorphous thin films, or polymer films, which are normally
insulators but become semiconducting when free charges are introduced
through electrodes, doping, or photoexcitation. Their technological
applications are manifold, including organic light emitting diodes,
organic field effect transistors, and organic solar cells. Organic
molecular crystal-based semiconductors have an advantage over conventional
inorganic semiconductors, in that they are held together by relatively
weaker van der Waals interactions. Compared to the more rigid ionic
or covalent bonds in inorganic materials, the van der Waals bonds
allow for a greater degree of flexibility, a fact that holds great
promise vis-a-vis the manufacturing of advanced electronic devices.
In principle, organic semiconducting materials have the ability to
act as ambipolar semiconductors, capable of both p-type and n-type
transport.12 However, it is observed in
practice that the majority of organic semiconductors typically display
p-type transport. This may be because the energetically high-lying
lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) in most organic semiconductors
hinders the efficient injection of electrons from the contact to the
LUMO. Additionally, it has been pointed out that n-type charge carriers
are vulnerable to be trapped by ambient oxidants, such as O2, H2O, or O3.12−15 Nevertheless, both n- and p-type
semiconductors are essential for the fabrication of complementary
integrated circuits, bipolar transistors, and organic p–n junctions
with high speed operation, low power consumption and operating stability
against the variation of operational parameters, as well as external
noise.16,17 Hence, the development of high performance
n-type organic semiconductors has become one of the major challenges
in the field of organic semiconductor and thin-film transistor research.

Perylene tetracarboxylic diimides (PTCDIs) are a class of perylene-based
organic semiconductors with a high potential for optoelectronic applications,
on account of their commercial availability, low cost, and electronic,
optical, and charge transport properties. These properties may be
conveniently tuned over a wide range by appropriate functionalization.14,18,19 Crucially, PTCDIs are n-type
semiconductors by virtue of their high electron affinity and large
electron mobility in the solid state.20−26 They have been significantly utilized as the electron-acceptor component
in organic solar cells.27−32 Fairly recently, Bednorz et al. have reported the fabrication of
a silicon/organic heterojunction-based IR photodetector capable of
operation in the telecom regime, using PTCDI-C1, also known as MePTC.33−35 PTCDIs are typically arranged in π-stacks, consisting of π-conjugated
perylene cores. The degree of overlap in the intermolecular π
orbitals tends to vary greatly among the various PTCDI derivatives.
These derivatives are formed using two main routes of functionalization:
(i) end functionalization or substitution on the imide nitrogens18,22,25,26,34,35 and (ii) core
functionalization or substitution in the so-called “bay area”
positions 1, 6, 7, and/or 12 (see Figure 1).13,14,20,21,23,24,36,37 PTCDIs are a class of well-known organic dyes38 ranging in color from red to maroon to black.
These materials display crystallochromy (dependence of color on crystal
packing), which is relevant to their application as commercial dyes.
This feature has been thoroughly investigated experimentally and theoretically.
Klebe et al. developed an empirical model to explain the visible absorption
maxima as a function of the π–π orbital overlap
area between stacked PTCDI molecules.39 Kazmaier and Hoffmann observed a strong correlation between the
crystal color and both longitudinal and transverse intermolecular
offsets, based on tight-binding extended Huckel calculations.40 More recently, it has been demonstrated by Zhao
et al.41 using time dependent Hartree–Fock-based
calculations that the electronically excited states of these materials,
which determine the color of the pigments, have no significant charge-transfer
character. A major issue with n-type semiconductors investigated so
far is the lack of air-stable operation. Lehmann et al. have shown
the absence of an air-stable field effect in certain PTCDI derivatives.42 Various factors influencing the air-stability
of organic thin-film transistor (OTFT) devices are still a matter
of active research.13,14,36 Jones et al. in a recent study on cyano-perylene diimides (PDIs)
have shown that the thermodynamic stability of charge carriers cannot
explain the operational stability of devices manufactured from these
materials.14,36 A kinetic approach towards air-stable
n-type semiconductors involves the design of compounds in which segregated
side chains prevent the intrusion of oxygen and moisture into the
active layer.21,22,43,44 Klauk et al.,13 however, have recently demonstrated that this kinetic model cannot
always explain the stability or instability of this class of materials.
Oh et al. have suggested a subtle interplay between electronic and
kinetic factors to determine the ambient stability of perylene bisimide
semiconductors.45 It appears as of date
that the optimal mobilities and stabilities in PDI-based organic semiconductors
can be obtained by combining both electronic and kinetic concepts.
Schmidt et al. have synthesized OTFTs from a broad spectrum of end-
and core-halogenated perylene diimides by varying fluorinated imide
substituents. The best OTFTs were obtained for PTCDI-C4F7. For distorted
core tetrahalogenated (fluorine, chlorine, or bromine) perylene diimides,
less advantageous solid state packing properties were found, and high
performance OTFTs were obtained from only one tetrachlorinated derivative,
PTCDI-F5Cl4.46

Figure 1 PTCDI derivatives.

In the present study, the structural
and electronic properties
of several PTCDI derivatives (Table 1) have been calculated using density functional theory
(DFT) simulations. In this study, we have performed a geometry optimization
on the molecules, the evaluation of the density of states (DOS) for
occupied as well as unoccupied orbitals and the calculation of the
X-ray absorption (XAS) spectra of these molecules have been performed.
We have subsequently attempted to obtain a relation between molecular
twisting and the electronic structure of the molecules.

Table 1 Description of the Molecules and Their Dihedral Angles
2 Computational
Approach
Geometry optimization and calculation of DOS and
XAS have been
performed using the StoBe implementation of the deMon package.47 The structural properties of the molecules were
obtained by optimizing their geometry. The geometry optimization process
primarily involves taking ab initio coordinates for the molecule and
then calculating the wavefunction using an iterative self-consistent
field method. We have provided an ab initio set of coordinates for
the molecule using Avogadro open-software (http://avogadro.cc/). The StoBe program
is subsequently used to calculate the equilibrium geometry of the
molecule, using a gradient-corrected Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(RPBE) exchange/correlation functional.48,49 The program
applies small perturbations to the ab initio geometry and calculates
the forces encountered by each coordinate, and the force constants
are assigned to a matrix called the Hessian matrix. The geometry is
again changed slightly so as to minimize these forces. A new wavefunction
is then calculated and the Hessian matrix is updated using this new
set of coordinates, by applying the quasi-Newton, Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno
method. This process is repeated until the forces have reached a previously
assigned low threshold value, at which point the geometry is considered
to have been optimized. In each case, the structural energy minimization
was performed for a single molecule applying the gradient-corrected
revised RPBE functional48,49 using a triple-ζ
valence plus polarization basis set for all C, N, H, O, and Cl atoms
and a double-ζ valence plus polarization basis for F. Auxiliary
basis sets were applied to fit the electron density and the exchange/correlation
potential.

In contrast with most other available DFT-based programs,
StoBe
also has a dedicated functionality to simulate core-electron spectroscopies.
Hence, it can be used to calculate both absorption [(XAS/near-edge
X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS)] and emission spectra arising
because of X-ray absorption at, or emission from, certain given core
levels of particular atomic sites within the molecule. This is implemented
in the StoBe code by localizing the core holes, enabling a distinction
between different excitation centers and allowing the calculation
of partial XAS spectra for every excitation center that is symmetrically
non-equivalent.50 While geometry optimization
calculations are performed using identical all-electron basis sets
for every atom, the spectroscopic simulations involving calculations
for core-excited and -ionized states use different basis sets for
the excited and spectator atoms, respectively.51 This is realized by describing the electrons in 1s orbitals
of every other atom of the same element using effective core potentials,
while the valence electrons are given by a [3s3p1d] valence basis
set to prevent a mixing between the corresponding core orbitals.52,53 An IGLO-III basis set54 is used to describe
the 1s electrons present at the excitation center in order to flexibly
describe core-hole relaxation. The resulting transitions from core
orbitals to unoccupied states including all excitation sites and both
spin channels are calculated as XAS spectra. In these calculations,
the polarization vector may be either p-polarized (perpendicular to
the molecular plane) and hence resonant with π* states or s-polarized
(parallel to the molecular plane) and hence resonant with σ*
states. In case of the s-polarized vector, the incident polarized
radiation is an average for every direction on the molecular plane.55

In this study, the aforementioned RPBE
functional was applied to
evaluate ionized and electronically excited states to obtain the N
k-edge XAS spectra for the different PTCDI derivatives. The N atom
was chosen as there are two symmetrically equivalent N atoms in all
the PTCDI derivative molecules, and thus, calculation with only one
of them is sufficient. Closely following Klues et al.,50 the nitrogen 1s (k-edge) XAS spectra was calculated
using the transition potential approximation (TPA).56,57 This method gives a faithful description of NEXAFS spectra at low
computational cost and provides an effective compromise in representing
the excitation, relaxation, and dynamical correlation effects. It
involves a self-consistent calculation of the electronic structure
of the molecule, where the electronic relaxation during the excitation
process is approximated by an N 1s orbital occupied by only half an
electron.51 The unoccupied orbitals which
are thus obtained then serve as approximations for final state orbitals
in the dipole transition calculation from N 1s core orbitals. The
spectral oscillator strengths and Kohn–Sham eigenvalue differences
can be obtained from the transition moments, from which approximate
excitation energies are calculated, giving an approximation for the
theoretical NEXAFS spectrum. The nitrogen excitation site is then
augmented by a large set of diffuse basis functions, [19s19p19d],
using a double basis set technique, to account for transitions into
diffuse Rydberg states and final states beyond ionization.51 The XAS spectrum thus calculated is only a first
order approximation and can be made more accurate. This may be done,
firstly, by introducing a rigid shift of the order of 1 eV to the
spectrum to account for the limitations in the electronic relaxation
obtained through the TPA and, secondly, by obtaining more reliable
excitation energies through explicit self-consistent calculations
for excited states by transferring the electron of an N 1s core orbital
to an unoccupied ground state.51 However,
the present study has more to do with the qualitative nature of the
NEXAFS spectrum than the absolute quantitative energy values, and
as such we have avoided these further computational refinements. It
may be noted therefore, to compare the calculated XAS spectra with
experiments, a rigid shift may have to be applied on the energy axis.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Structural Properties
Upon structural optimization,
the molecules displayed varying degrees of twist in the perylene backbone.
Following Delgado et al.,58 this twist
was measured using the dihedral angle θ, defined by C6–C6′–C7′–C7 as shown in Figure 1.

The names, chemical formula, and dihedral angles obtained
from geometry optimization for the different molecules are given in Table 1. The side-on view
of the geometry optimized structure of the molecules are shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Side-on view of the geometry
of the optimized structure of the
molecules.

PTCDI-C1 and PTCDI-C2 were observed
to have planar structures.
Of the halogenated molecules, the end-substituted PTCDI-C4F7 was found
to have a planar structure, whereas the core-substituted PTCDI-F2
molecule displays an intermediate level of twisting, and the PTCDI-F5Cl4
with halogen substitution in both core and end positions was found
to have a highly twisted backbone. This is mainly due to the Coulomb
repulsion between the four large chlorine atoms situated in the “bay
area”.

Interestingly, PTCDI-C3 displays two very distinct
structures,
depending on the selection of the ab initio coordinates. A cis structure
and a trans structure have been obtained, with the energy difference
between the two stereoisomers being of the order of 6 × 10–3 eV. This small difference in energy suggests that
the two stereoisomers are equally energetically viable, and the samples
of PTCDI-C3 may contain both in equal measures. This stereoisomerism
in PTCDI-C3 has not been previously reported in the literature.

3.2 Unoccupied Density of States Calculation
The frontier
molecular orbitals of the various molecules, along with their corresponding
energies, are given in Figure 3. Though the present form of DFT calculation usually underestimates
the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)–LUMO gap, the
qualitative changes are reliable.59,60

Figure 3 Calculated
HOMO and LUMO for PTCDI derivatives. The energy values
are shown as obtained from the calculation following Delgado et al.58

In concurrence with Delgado et al.,58 both the HOMO and LUMO are found to be π-type orbitals, spread
out over the entire molecule core, with multiple nodes observed along
the long molecular axis and on the imide nitrogens. The molecules
with hydrocarbon end-substituents are observed to have HOMOs and LUMOs
of identical values, whereas the halogenated molecules, both core-
and end-substituted, display frontier molecular orbitals at somewhat
different energies. The DOS structure was calculated using the Doscalc
utility provided with StoBe. A component-resolved analysis of the
unoccupied molecular orbitals has been performed separately for σ-type
and π-type orbitals as shown in Figure 4. In the perylene core, the carbon molecules
exist in an sp2 hybridized state. A mixture of s, px, and py orbitals
contribute to the in-plane σ-type orbitals. The delocalized
pz orbitals are of the π-type and
remain orthogonal to the molecular plane, forming the π conjugated
structure of the perylene core which allows the semiconductor action.
In principle, it is expected that the σ-type orbitals should
be obtained at higher binding energies, whereas the π-type orbitals
should occur at lower binding energies. While this has been found
to be the case in general, low-intensity signatures for σ-type
orbitals in regions of π-dominance have been observed at low
binding energies close to the Fermi level.

molecular orbitals for various molecules.
The energy values are as obtained from the calculation.

The intensity of σ-type orbitals at lower
binding energies
for the relatively planar PTCDI-C1, PTCDI-C2, the trans isomer of
PTCDI-C3, and PTCDI-C4F7 has been found to be comparatively low. However,
with an increase in the degree of twisting of the molecular backbone,
the signature becomes significant at lower energies, as observed in
the twisted cis isomer of PTCDI-C3 as well as the core-halogenated
PTCDI-F2 and PTCDI-F5Cl4 molecules. A systematic, almost linearly
increasing relationship has been observed between the intensities
of these low binding energy σ orbitals and the twisting, as
measured by the dihedral angle in the perylene core of the molecules.
Because the height as well as intensity of peaks in the partial density
of states (PDOS) curve for s, px, and
py orbitals (given by the area under the
curve) is a measure of the densities of σ-type orbitals, hence
plotting the area under the curve representing the PDOS of each molecule
at low binding energies, against the dihedral angle measured in the
molecular core, gives the relation between low lying σ orbitals
and molecular twisting. It may be noted here that the aforementioned
low binding energies have been defined as regions where there is a
clear dominance of π-type orbitals over the σ-type.

The area under the σ-type orbitals (s, px, and py) close to the Fermi level
is plotted against the dihedral angles of various molecules and is
presented in Figure 5. The intensity is found to increase systematically with the increase
of the twisting of the molecules. As can be seen from the figure,
an exception to this almost linear relation is found in the fluorinated
molecules PTCDI-C4F7 and PTCDI-F2. It may be noted that the fluorinated
molecules are unlikely to follow the same trend as the non-fluorinated
molecules because of the inversed linear dichroism observed in fluorinated
planar aromatic molecules by de Oteyza et al.61 We have also calculated the component resolved DOS for the unoccupied
states of fluorine, carbon, and nitrogen in PTCDI-C4F7 and PTCDI-F2,
as shown in Figure 6 (data for PTCDI-F2 not shown for similarity).

at low binding energies as a function
of molecular twisting for various molecules.

Figure 6 Component resolved DOS for the unoccupied states of fluorine, carbon,
and nitrogen in PTCDI-C4F7.

From Figure 6, it can be clearly seen
that in the
case of fluorine, the σ orbital dominates over the π orbital
at lower energies close to the Fermi level, contrary to what is seen
in carbon and nitrogen. This is indicative of inversed linear dichroism
as observed by de Oteyza et al. This unusually large σ intensity
due to fluorine is the reason why these two molecules display overall
larger σ-peak intensities at lower energies compared to the
other molecules. This argument can also be used to explain the similar
trend observed for the XAS results in Figure 8.

spectra for different molecules.

3.3 Calculation of X-ray Absorption
Spectra
In the absence
of experimental results in the literature, a simulation of the X-ray
absorption spectra for the molecules has been performed to provide
corroboration for the results obtained in the DOS calculations because
the XAS spectrum, specifically, of the NEXAFS, provides a detailed
description of the unoccupied molecular orbitals above the Fermi level,
albeit for excited states in the presence of a core hole. The XAS
spectra were calculated using the Xrayspec utility available with
StoBe. Two separate modes were taken for the calculation of the spectra—one
where the polarization vector of the incident radiation was simulated
to be at right angles to the plane of the molecular core and the second
where the polarization vector is parallel with respect to the same
molecular core. In this second mode, the average of all possible directions
in the plane is taken. These two modes thus allow the XAS spectra
of the molecule to be calculated for both normal and grazing incidence
of radiation. The normally incident radiation, with its electric field
in the molecular plane, is expected to resonate with the in-plane
σ-type orbitals (σ polarization), whereas the grazing
radiation with its electric field orthogonal to the molecular plane
will excite the similarly oriented π-type orbitals (π
polarization).

In Figure 7, the calculated N k-edge XAS spectra with σ and π
polarization for all the molecules are shown. In the case of PTCDI-C1
with its almost perfectly planar core, the lower energy π orbitals
were seen to dominate the resonance at lower photon energies just
above the Fermi level, whereas the σ type orbitals did not dominate
until ∼6 eV above the Fermi level. A similar observation was
made for the similarly planar PTCDI-C2 molecule, where σ-type
orbitals start to dominate at around 4.5 eV above the Fermi level.
This result is in clear agreement with PDOS for the PTCDI-C1 and PTCDI-C2
molecules (Figure 4a,b), where the π orbitals were seen to dominate at lower binding
energies and the σ orbitals at higher binding energies. The
two stereoisomers of PTCDI-C3 gave almost identical XAS spectra, with
the π orbitals dominating at lower photon energies and the σ
orbitals at higher energies. However, in contrast to the planar PTCDI-C1
molecule, both the cis and trans isomers displayed small, low intensity
σ polarized peaks at energies very close to the Fermi level.
In fact, these low intensity peaks were seen to overlap with the much
higher intensity π polarized peaks at these energies. The size
of the low energy σ polarized peaks in the twisted cis isomer
was observed to be distinctly greater than in the relatively planar
trans isomer. This difference is in agreement with the corresponding
low energy signatures for σ-type orbitals observed in the DOS
calculations for these molecules (Figure 4c,d). The trend for low energy signatures
for the σ-type orbitals with increasing twisting has been further
corroborated with the observation of a significant σ polarized
peak in PTCDI-F2, overlapping with the lowest energy π polarized
peak. This is replicated in PTCDI-F5Cl4, the most twisted molecule
within our set, which has the largest low energy σ polarized
peak
of all, overlapping with the second π polarized peak.

It can thus be argued that here, as in the case of the unoccupied
DOS, a distinct positive correlation exists between the abundance
of relatively shallow, or weakly bound σ-type molecular orbitals,
and the degree of twisting in the molecular core. This is further
demonstrated in Figure 7 by plotting the area under the low energy signatures against the
degree of twisting of each molecule, as done for the DOS.

A
comparison between Figures 7 and 5 readily displays a noteworthy
similarity in the nature of both plots. This is particularly highlighted
in the case of the PTCDI-F5Cl4 molecule, which is significantly more
twisted than all the other molecules; yet, in both plots it faithfully
contributes to the almost linear trend. The close matching in the
linear trends of Figures 5 and 7 seems to provide convincing
evidence in favor of a linear relationship between the abundance of
σ-type orbitals in π-dominated energy regions close to
the Fermi level, and the degree of twisting of the perylene core,
in PTCDI derivatives. It may be noted that in the case of XAS results,
the spectra in the π and σ resonances are the result of
the electronic structure of the unoccupied orbitals as well as the
effect of the cross-section of the orbitals with respect to radiation,
whereas the results obtained from unoccupied DOS are purely related
to the chemical nature of the unoccupied orbitals of the molecules.

3.4 Occupied Density of States Calculation
For completeness
of the study, we have also calculated the component resolved density
of states for the occupied molecular orbitals of the molecules and
investigated the comparative intensities of the σ- and π-type
orbitals at energies close to the Fermi level, as shown in Figure 9.

Figure 9 Component resolved occupied
molecular orbitals for various molecules.
The energy values are as obtained from the calculation.

A similar attempt in line with the analysis performed
for the unoccupied
states as discussed above has been made with the intensities of the
occupied levels. No systematic relation was observed in the intensities
of either type of orbital with the degree of twisting in the molecule.
This shows an absence of any discernible signal for twisting in the
occupied molecular orbitals closest to the Fermi level, in contrast
with what has been observed in the unoccupied molecular orbitals.
Because the occupied molecular orbitals are determined by the inter-atomic
interactions within the molecules, they are not quite as susceptible
to physical features such as twisting. It may be noted that the bond
lengths and angles are fixed for specific bonds in a molecule. There
is a negligible change of about 0.04–0.06% in the bond lengths
and the angles because of twisting in PTCDI-C3, for example. Therefore
the inter-atomic interactions remain essentially unchanged for twisting.
Because the occupied DOS depends on these parameters, they are also
unlikely to be affected for twisting in an optimized geometry. Consequently,
no effect of twisting was observed in the occupied DOS. It may thus
be argued that the occupied DOS for the molecules is mainly determined
by the chemical nature of the molecule, whereas the unoccupied DOS
of a molecule is specified by chemical as well as physical properties,
such as twisting.

4 Conclusions
In this
study, we have obtained the equilibrium geometry for certain
PTCDI derivatives and calculated their occupied and unoccupied density
of states separately for the molecular orbitals lying in-plane (σ-type)
and orthogonal to the plane (π-type) of the molecules. We have
also simulated the XAS spectrum for these molecules separately for
radiation polarized normal as well as parallel to the molecular plane.
These angles of incidence led to resonance of π- and σ-type
molecular orbitals, respectively. We have thus been able to effect
a comparison between the unoccupied DOS and XAS results because both
provide a description of the molecular orbitals above the Fermi level.
We have observed the presence of σ orbitals close to the Fermi
level and have obtained an almost linear relationship between the
abundance of these orbitals in π-dominated regions and the degree
of molecular twist. While the signature for weakly bound σ orbitals
in XAS data might be explained by suggesting that a twisting of the
molecular core might physically change the orientation of the molecular
orbitals, thereby increasing the cross-section of certain orbitals
with respect to radiation incident at particular angles, a replication
of these results in the unoccupied DOS data seems to point to a more
fundamental change in the energy distribution of the unoccupied molecular
orbitals because of twisting. A similar relationship has not been
observed in the occupied molecular orbitals, which indicates that
the effect of twisting reflects more on the unoccupied levels compared
to the occupied ones. We conclude from this observation that the occupied
DOS is almost exclusively determined by the chemical structure of
the molecule, while the nature of the unoccupied DOS can be significantly
affected by physical properties such as molecular twisting.

Additionally, we have observed a hitherto unobserved stereoisomerism
in PTCDI-C3. We have shown that both the stereoisomers are energetically
viable. This suggests the possibility of stereoisomerism in other
PTCDI derivatives, which will provide fundamental insight into the
relation, or lack thereof, between the structure of the individual
organic molecules and their performance as semiconductors.
