This
article demonstrates a novel nanoscale surface modification
method to enhance the selectivity of porous poly(dimethylsiloxane)
(PDMS) in removing oil from water. The surface modification method
is simple and low cost by using sugar as a sacrificial template for
temporal adhering of carbon nanotubes (CNT) before addition of PDMS
prepolymer to encapsulate the CNT on its surface once polymerized.
The PDMS–CNT demonstrated a tremendous increase in absorption
capacity up to 3-fold compared to previously reported absorbents composed
solely of PDMS. Besides showcasing excellent absorption capacity,
the PDMS–CNT also shows a faster absorption rate (25 s) as
compared to that of pure PDMS (40 s). The enhanced absorption rate
is due to the incorporation of CNT, which roughens the surface of
the polymer at the nanoscale and lowers the surface energy of porous
PDMS while at the same time increasing the absorbent hydrophobicity
and oleophilicity. This property makes the absorbent unique in absorbing
only oil but repelling water at the same time. The PDMS–CNT
is an excellent absorbent material with outstanding recyclability
and selectivity for removing oil from water.

==== Body
Introduction
Oil spillage and discharge
of harmful organic solvents from industries
into water bodies pose a great threat to the environment, particularly
to the fragile marine life. Although prevention of oil spill mishaps
at sea is preferred, there are still numerous possibilities of human
errors that lead to accidents. Regulatory bodies are often unable
to completely monitor illegal dumping of organic solvents into water
bodies. The largest oil spill at the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 has adversely
affected aquatic and avian life as well as human life.1 The presence of an oil layer on the surface of water prevents
light penetration and oxygen diffusion that are crucial for the survival
of marine life. Carcinogenicity and mutagenicity of these pollutants
are also major threats to the aquatic population presiding in the
ocean and the people living near the coastline.2

Current conventional methods employed in oil spill
cleanup are
oil skimming, in situ burning, and bioremediation. However, these
methods have drawbacks such as being time consuming, high inc cost,
leading to secondary pollution, or being unable to completely recover
the spilled oil. As an alternative to these suboptimal methods, sorbent
materials attract interest as an effective means to selectively absorb
spilled oil from water due to the simple process and efficacy.3−6 An ideal absorbent material should be hydrophobic and oleophilic
for selective oil–water separation, mechanically stable, highly
porous, have a high absorption capacity, and possess good recyclability.

In recent times, researches were focused on nanomaterials such
as aerogels,7−10 graphene,11−14 carbon nanotubes (CNT),15,16 electrospun fibers,3,17 and magnetic nanoparticles.16,18 Although these nanomaterial-based
absorbents show promising outcomes, the utilization of nanomaterial
solely for a large-scale purpose will be expensive, complex, and time
consuming. Alternatively, the process can be simplified by incorporating
nanomaterials on the surface of polymer to form smart selective absorbent.
Carbon-based nanomaterials are an excellent candidate to form this
smart selective absorbent due to their excellent hydrophobic property,
high absorption capacity, and environment friendly properties. Among
the many nanomaterials, CNTs took the spotlight as the material of
interest because of their efficacy in absorbing a wide range of organic
and inorganic solvents due to their capabilities of chemical–nanotube
interactions, high absorption capacity, rapid uptake rate, tailored
surface chemistry, and natural state of hydrophobicity.15 CNT powder can be easily synthesized through
chemical vapor deposition using suitable metal catalysts and carbon
sources. However, to develop robust interconnected CNT in bulk scale
requires expensive equipment and sophisticated steps.16

Therefore, to overcome such limitations, a simple
surface-modified
absorbent is proposed by incorporating CNT on porous poly(dimethylsiloxane)
(PDMS) polymer. PDMS was synthesized as a base structure, holding
the evenly dispersed CNT, giving it excellent flexibility and mechanical
strength. The simple and cost-effective method to fabricate PDMS makes
it a highly valuable material to be developed as a base structure.
PDMS itself had been used by researchers19,20 as an absorbent of high potential for the uptake oil and various
solvents.

Despite the promising potential of PDMS, there is
the intermittent
water absorption problem due to water adherence on the surface of
PDMS that could affect its capability. The limitation of the polymer
was overcome by increasing the surface roughness through the incorporation
of CNTs, which possess a large surface area and are highly hydrophobic
and oleophilic.21−23 Surface roughness is crucial in improving the hydrophobicity
and its importance can be proven by Wenzel’s equation and the
Cassie–Baxter equation. Besides that, CNT is also capable of
lowering the surface energy, leading to greater hydrophobicity, as
described in Young’s equation. In this study, we demonstrated
a simple method to address the issues faced by individual nanomaterials
and polymers by modifying the surface of porous PDMS with CNTs where
the strength of CNTs will compensate the shortcomings of PDMS and
vice versa. CNTs were transferred onto the PDMS surface using a temporal
sugar template. Once PDMS is polymerized, the sugar template was removed,
leaving the CNTs on the PDMS surface, creating an improved hydrophobic
PDMS surface. All fabrication processes were carried out in atmospheric
pressure and room temperature. This modified PDMS surface can be used
as it is without further modification, similar to the sponge function
of absorbing oil. In our case, the sponge repels water and only absorbs
to maximize the absorption capability. In our perception, this simple
and inexpensive surface modification method demonstrated a promising
absorbent that can be scaled-up to solve oil spill issues.

Results
and Discussion
To investigate the effect of CNT on the oil
absorption capacity,
the surface was modified using various CNT concentrations (0.2–10
mg mL–1) in preparing the absorbent material. PDMS
containing 10 mg mL–1 of CNT (PC10) exhibited the
highest absorption capacity and was selected for further study. Any
further addition of CNT leads to the removal of excess CNT during
the ultrasonication. A systematic study on the hydrophobicity and
absorption of different types of oil and organic solvent was done
to characterize the properties of the absorbent material.

Characterization
of PDMS–CNT Absorbent
Figure 1 shows the cross-sectional
field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images of the
PDMS and PC10. The CNT binding on the surface of porous PC10 forms
noodlelike structures which are tightly packed to each other. At lower
concentrations of CNT, there are free spaces on the surface of PDMS
that are available for CNT binding, as shown in Figure S1. The agglomeration of CNT observed in Figure 1d is due to the presence of
van der Waals forces between CNT. In contrast to commercial powdered
CNTs, CNTs in Figure 1e,f are loosely packed and further apart from each other, due to
the weaker Van der Waals forces between the carbon nanotubes. The
smooth surface of porous PDMS seen in Figure 1a,b is substantially roughened by the presence
of CNTs, as can be seen in Figure 1c,d, which leads to improved hydrophobicity, as proven
by Wenzel’s equation and the Cassie–Baxter equation
(eqs S1 and S2).24

PC10, and (e, f) standalone CNT.

Figure 2a
illustrates
the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of PDMS and −PC10.
The asymmetric and symmetric peaks at 2905 and 2970 cm–1 show −CH3 stretching in ≡Si–CH3. The presence of −CH3 deformation vibration
in PDMS can also be seen at the 1400 and 1270 cm–1 peak. Besides that, peaks are also present in the 930–1200
cm–1 range and show the presence of Si–O–Si
stretching or deformation.25,26 Peaks at 850 and 804
cm–1 show the presence of Si–C bands and
Si(CH3)2 rocking.27,28 A clear difference
can be observed between PDMS and PC10 at 906 cm–1, where the PC10 shows a sharp peak with lower intensity compared
with PDMS. As reported earlier,24 this
may be due to the presence of Si–C bonds between CNT and the
porous PDMS structure.

Figure 2 (a) FTIR spectra of PDMS and PDMS–CNT at the peak
of focus
(400–2100 cm–1). Inset shows the overall
FTIR spectra. (b) Raman spectra for porous PDMS and PC10 comparison.

Raman spectrum of porous PDMS
is shown in Figure 2b. Peaks are similar to previously reported
works on PDMS spectra.25,27 The peaks consist mainly of Si–O–Si
symmetrical peak at 483 cm–1 and Si–CH3 symmetric rocking peak at 609 cm–1. The
presence of Si–C asymmetric stretching at 704 cm–1 and CH3 symmetric rocking can be seen at 782 cm–1. Besides that, CH3 symmetric rocking appears at 866 cm–1 and CH3 symmetric bending appears at 1244
cm–1. CH3 asymmetric bending can also
be seen at 1402 cm–1. Generally, the intensity of
the PDMS peaks is reduced with the presence of CNT. CNT peaks have
been studied, and band assignments were identified in previous studies.29−31 Characteristic peaks of carbon materials exist between 1000 and
1800 cm–1 in Raman spectra for excitation energy
in the visible and infrared spectrum. In this study, green (514 nm)
laser radiation was used and indicates the presence of D band (disorder
band) and wide G band at 1318 and 1609 cm–1, respectively.
The disentanglement of the CNT and polymer infiltration into CNT bundles
explains the wide G band peak shown in Figure 2b. The intensity ratio of D to G bands is
low due to the usage of green laser radiation. The intensity of G
bands can be increased by switching to red laser radiation.31

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
analysis in Figure S2 indicates that the
main elements of
PDMS and PC10 are carbon, silicon, and oxygen. The carbon content
shows significant increase from 47.64 to 63.86% for PC10. The increase
in carbon element lowers the surface energy for the PDMS–CNT,12,32 which leads to increase in contact angle, as proposed in Young’s
equation shown (eq S3).33,34 It also can be observed that the intensity of Si 2s and 2p peaks
is reduced with the addition of CNT to the PDMS. This is because the
magnitude of the silicon to oxygen bond is greatly reduced as the
amount of Si–C bonds increases with the presence of CNT.

Surface Wetting Property
A higher contact angle (121.8°)
of PC10 (Figure 3b)
as compared to that of the pure porous PDMS (89.5°) (Figure 3a) can be seen, suggesting
that the presence of CNT increases the hydrophobicity. Generally,
pure porous PDMS is hydrophobic by nature (Table S1). However, it exhibits intermittent hydrophilic–hydrophobic
properties, where water adheres to the surface of the pure porous
PDMS when forcefully immersed in water. On the other hand, water droplets
do not adhere to the surface of PC10 and can be easily shaken off.
PC10 contact angle shows increments of up to 32.3° due to the
presence of CNTs that enhance the surface roughness and lower the
surface energy. The enhanced surface roughness traps gas molecules
in the asperity valleys. This leads to disruption of the interface
between solid and liquid continuity and formation of alternate solid–liquid
and gas–liquid interfaces.35 This
phenomenon makes water hard to penetrate the rough surface asperities.
The surface energy determines the forces of attraction or repulsion
of a surface on the liquid. If the surface energy is lower than surface
tension of liquid, the liquid can maintain its droplet shape. Since
water has high surface tension, it will form a droplet on the surface.
Comparatively, PC10 has lower surface energy than that of PDMS; therefore,
the water droplet contact angle is higher. In contrast, oil derivatives
having lower surface tension than the surface energy will spread over
the solid surface. This is because the surface energy overpowers the
oil surface tension, preventing it from forming a droplet and spread
over the solid surface.

porous PDMS and (b)
PC10.

Removal of Oil and Organic
Solvents
The removal of
oil was investigated by measuring the amount of oil uptake per gram
of PC10. Visual inspection revealed obvious swelling and increased
volume, suggesting that the mechanism of removal is by absorption
rather than adsorption. Oil was absorbed into porous PC10 structure
by capillary action, and the rise and fall of liquid can be described
using Jurin’s law as follows 1  where h is the
height of
liquid absorbed, γ is the surface tension, θ is the contact
angle of the liquid on the tube wall, ρ is the density of the
liquid, g is gravity acceleration, and r is the radius of tube. This law suggests that the presence of fibrous
CNT within the pores facilitates the capillary action by reducing
the radius of the pore. Figure 4a illustrates that presence of CNT on the surface of the inner
pores reduces the radius for better oil uptake. The oil absorption
performance can be observed in the inset of Figure 4a. The bar diagram reveals the performance
comparison of pure PDMS and PC10 on the basis of absorption capacity.
PC10 rises 3-fold compared with PDMS, showing the influence of CNT
facilitates oil trapping in the porous matrix.

PDMS and PC10 on the basis of their FESEM images. Inset: Bar diagram

capacity changes with different CNT concentrations. Inset: linear
regression of concentration-dependent absorption capacities. (c) Comparison
of kinetic absorption between PDMS and PC10.

To further verify the effect of CNTs on oil absorption, different
concentrations of CNTs were utilized before the molding process. As
can be seen in Figure 4b, the absorption capacity increases as the concentration increases
in almost a linear manner until it reaches saturation at approximately
6 mg mL–1. The inset in Figure 4b shows the linear increment of percentage
absorption capacity, suggesting that more CNTs are occupying the empty
PDMS surface. The minute increment from 6 to 10 mg mL–1 is to fully occupy the spaces of the porous PDMS. Excess CNTs beyond
10 mg mL–1 are removed during sonication process,
indicating that CNTs had fully occupied the spaces between the porous
PDMS. Besides that, CNT also improves the absorption time upon contact
with petrol. As seen in Figure 4c, PC10 only takes approximately only 25 s to achieve saturation
whereas pure porous PDMS takes approximately 40 s. Petrol was absorbed
into the PDMS and PC10 structure through capillary action and maintained
in the porous structure by Van der Waals forces. Rapid surface wetting
of PC10 can be related to the low surface energy due to presence of
more carbon element. Besides that, the surface roughness of PC10 also
influences the rapid surface wetting due to larger surface area contact.

PC10 was tested further on various other organic solvents and oil.
This work could achieve absorption capacities ranging from 1300 to
3100% depending on the type of absorbate. Various types of organic
solvents and oils with different densities and viscosities, such as
cyclohexane, diesel oil, toluene, engine oil, vegetable oil, chlorobenzene,
dichloromethane, and chloroform, were used. As shown in Figure 5, the density of the absorbate
influences the absorption capacity of the absorbent material. High-density
solvents such as chloroform could achieve up to 31 times the weight,
whereas low-density solvents such as petrol could absorb only ∼15
times the weight. The difference is attributed to the mass of absorbate
over the same volume, which is lower in low-density absorbates, hence
influencing the final mass of the absorbent material. A study was
conducted to prove this phenomenon by placing PC10 in 8 mL of chloroform
and of petrol. It is observed that both 8 mL absorbates were absorbed
into the absorbent material and produced different absorption capacities.
The difference is due to chloroform having a higher density compared
to that of petrol, which leads to higher mass gain by PC10. Therefore,
the limiting factor on the amount of absorbate that can be absorbed
is the volume. Interestingly, it was also observed that the PDMS–CNT
could absorb polar absorbates such as dichloromethane, chlorobenzene,
and toluene besides nonpolar absorbates. This opens new avenues for
PDMS–CNT absorbent to be used in cleaning harmful organic solvents
besides oil spills.

absorbates
of different densities. Inset: reproducibility performance of PC10.

The reproducibility of the PC10
absorbent shown in Figure 5 inset has the relative standard
deviation of 0.46% with similar conditions of fabrication technique
and material. This reproducibility data demonstrates a consistency
in oil absorption performance due to ease in controlling the fabrication
condition and parameter. A comparison of previous works on absorbent-related
material is shown in Table 1. Although the absorption capacity of nanomaterial shows great
superiority over the current work in terms of absorption capacity,
the simple and cost-effective method of developing PC10 is much favorable
for large-scale development. This PC10 acts as a bridge between polymer
and nanomaterials to compensate the shortcoming of each material,
whereby CNT as nanomaterial improves the absorption of oil and PDMS
as polymer improves the flexibility and mechanical strength using
a cheap and simple method. Ultimately, PC10 shows the best of both
worlds in removal of oil and organic solvent applications. A more
detailed comparison of previous works is shown in Table S2.

Analytical Performance of Absorbent, Recyclability, and Selectivity
An ideal absorbent includes the ability to recover the absorbate
to be reused, i.e., the ability to be used repeatedly without diminishing
the performance. Figure 6a shows comparison between the effect of heat application and mechanical
compression on the percentage absorption capacity. Clearly, it can
be seen that the heat application possesses consistent absorption
capacity per cycle compared with mechanical compression. This is attributed
to the inconsistency of the absorbent in returning to its initial
mass after mechanical compression, as shown in Figure 6b. This may be due to trapping of oil inside
the absorbent material after compression that influences the absorption
capacity of the following cycle. In terms of selectivity, we dropped
chloroform that was dyed with Sudan III into a beaker filled with
tap water, followed by absorption of oil using PC10. PC10 was observed
to be able to absorb the chloroform immediately upon contact and remained
floating on the water, as shown in Figure 7 due to its hydrophobic property (121.8°).
As reported earlier, when porous PDMS is immersed in water, water
adheres to the surface. In this study, the water does not adhere to
the surface due to the presence of CNTs that increased the hydrophobicity.
Water droplets on PC10 absorbent can be easily removed by shaking
off from the surface without wiping the surface. The selectivity and
recyclability of this PC10 makes an excellent absorbent material to
be used not only for oil spill recovery but also for various organic
solvent remediations.

Conclusions
A
simple and inexpensive novel method to modify the surface of
PDMS using CNTs has been demonstrated. CNTs are successfully transferred
on the surface of PDMS from a sacrificial sugar template, forming
uniform distribution of CNT in noodlelike structure throughout the
pores of PDMS. The effect of the amount of CNT concentration on the
performance of oil absorption was investigated. The decoration of
CNT enhances the absorption capacity to 3100%, which is 3-fold higher
than that in a previously reported study on pure PDMS. With the inclusion
of CNT, the absorbent shows rapid absorption and improved hydrophobicity
from 89.5 to 121.8°, leading to enhanced selective removal of
oil from water. The ability to be reuse, recycle, and recover makes
it an excellent cost-effective absorbent material. The absorption
is not only limited to oil derivatives but also can be extended to
various polar and nonpolar organic solvents. Moreover, the PC10 demonstrated
excellent recyclability property using two different methods which
were mechanical compression and heat application. The strategy proposed
in this study using surface-modified PDMS with CNT, also opens a new
avenue to be applied in industrial waste water treatment system by
removing harmful solvents before release to the environment.

Experimental
Section
Material and Reagent
PDMS and thermal curing agent
(Sylgard 184 Silicone Elastomer Kit) were purchased from Dow Corning
(Michigan). Carbon nanotubes (TUBALL) were purchased from OCSiAl (Luxembourg).
Acetone, chloroform, cyclohexane, toluene, cholorobenzene, and dichloromethane
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Missouri). Petrol, engine oil,
and diesel oil were purchased from Petronas Sdn Bhd (Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia). Vegetable oil and sugar were purchased from local shops.
All reagents were stored as per supplier recommendations.

Carbon Nanotube
Solution Preparation
CNT was dispersed
in acetone solution using a tip sonicator for 30 min for even distribution
of the carbon nanotubes. To study the effect of CNT in oil absorption
application, various concentrations of CNT solution are prepared by
altering CNT mass (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 5, and 10 mg mL–1) but keeping the volume of solvent constant (1 mL).

Absorbent Material Preparation
One milliliter of 10
mg mL–1 CNT solution was evenly dispersed and mixed
with 2.5 g of sugar, then dried in an oven at 150 °C for 1 h
to remove solvent. The sugar mixture was then kneaded by adding a
few drops of water and casted into molds (1 cm × 1 cm ×
1 cm), as shown in Figure 8. The molds were then dried in the oven at 100 °C for
1 h to form the sugar template. A mixture of PDMS was prepared on
a Petri dish by mixing PDMS prepolymer and thermal curing agent in
a ratio of 10:1 (w/w) and degassed for 3 h. The sugar template was
then placed in a mixture of PDMS solution. The mixture of PDMS penetrates
the sugar template using capillary forces. The sugar template with
absorbed mixture was then cured at 80 °C for 2 h to complete
the polymerization. After curing, the sugar template was removed by
dissolving it in water at 40 °C and sonicated to remove the remaining
sugar template to form PDMS/CNT(PC10) surface-modified absorbent.
These steps were repeated using different concentrations: 0.1 (PC0.1),
0.2 (PC0.2), 0.4 (PC0.4), 0.6 (PC0.6), 0.8 (PC0.8), 1 (PC1), and 5
(PC5).

Figure 8 Schematic illustration of PDMS and PC10 preparation.

Characterization of Absorbent Material
The cross-sectional
morphology of the PDMS and PDMS–CNT was analyzed using a variable
pressure field emission scanning electron microscope (VPFESEM, Zeiss
Supra55 VP). PDMS–CNT was coated with gold to prevent a charging
effect, and samples images were captured under a low beam voltage
(5 kV). To verify the bonding of the CNT on the surface of PDMS, Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Model: Pelkin Elmer, Spectrum
One) analysis was used. To further verify the presence of CNT on the
PDMS, Raman spectroscopy (Horiba Scientific) was conducted at 514
nm. The surface chemical composition was obtained using X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS Model: Thermo Scientific, K-Alpha) with a monochromatic
Al Kα1 source of 1593 eV. The ramé-hart contact
angle goniometer was used to determine the water contact angle directly
by capturing the static image of droplets of water on the surface.
Contact angles on both sides were taken, and the average was calculated
to determine the contact angle of the surface.

Oil Absorption Test
To determine the oil absorption
capacity, initial mass, (mi) of PDMS–CNT
was obtained before being immersed in the oil or organic solvents
(100 mL) until fully absorbed. After it was submerged, the surface
residual liquid was drained before measuring the final mass, (mf). Absorption capacity percentage was calculated
using the following equation 2  Absorbates tested
were petrol, diesel oil,
engine oil, vegetable oil, toluene, cyclohexane, chlorobenzene, dichloromethane,
and chloroform.

Reproducibility, Recyclability, and Reusability
Performance
Test
The absorbent was fabricated five more times to ensure
reproducibility under similar condition and parameter. Reproducibility
was verified with oil absorption test. Two methods of removing the
absorbate were carried out: heat application and mechanical compression,
as demonstrated in Figure 9. Heat application was performed using a hot plate to increase
the temperature to the boiling point of the absorbate for removal
through evaporation, whereas mechanical compression was performed
by squeezing the PC10 to 10% of its original volume.
