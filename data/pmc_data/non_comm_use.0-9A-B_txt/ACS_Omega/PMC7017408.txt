The effect of fenamic acid−α-aminoisobutyric acid
corner motif in α,β,γ-hybrid peptides has been reported.
From X-ray single-crystal diffraction studies, it is observed that
Phe-containing peptide 1 has an “S”-shaped
conformation that is stabilized by two consecutive intramolecular
N–H···N hydrogen bonds. However, the tyrosine
analogue peptide 2 has an “S”-shaped conformation,
which is stabilized by consecutive intramolecular six-member N–H···N
and seven-member N–H···O hydrogen bonds. The
asymmetric unit of peptide 3 containing m-aminobenzoic acid has two molecules which are stabilized by multiple
intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions. There are also π–π
stacking interactions between the aromatic rings of fenamic acid.
The peptides 1 and 2 have a polydisperse
microsphere morphology, but peptide 3 has an entangled
fiber-like morphology. Peptides 1–3 do not form
organogels. However, in the presence of water, the peptide 3 forms a phase-selective instant gel in xylene. The gel exhibits
high stability and thermal reversibility. The phase-selective gel
of peptide 3 is highly responsive to H2SO4.

Introduction
Molecular conformations, the three-dimensional structures of molecules,
are highly important to study the recognition and assembly process
and have wide applications in medicine and materials science.1 Among the molecular building blocks, the conformational
analysis of peptides is highly challenging.2 There are many factors that contribute to the molecular conformation
of peptides. There are a large number of degrees of freedom for α-peptides.
Also, the transannular interactions like hydrogen bonds, π–π
stacking interactions, ionic interactions, and hydrophobic interactions
play important roles.3 Moreover, the range
of steric interactions, steric hindrance, and geometrical rigidity
is also crucial.4,5 In this regard, the incorporation
of noncoded β, γ, δ, or ε amino acids is very
common for the design of hybrid peptides.6−8 There are many
examples that show how relatively small modifications have huge impact
on conformational preferences.9−12 Recently, Gopi and co-workers have discussed about the conformational
analysis of peptides containing unsaturated aliphatic amino acids.13 Previously, we have also reported the conformational
studies and structural versatilities of small peptides.14−18

Phase-selective gelation has the potential to solve environmental
issues like oil spill recovery from aquatic bodies and water purification
by removing the pollutants.19 The phase-selective
organogelator has the potential to form a gel in one solvent, preferentially
from the immiscible solvent mixture.20 In
2001, an amino acid amphiphile-based phase-selective gel was reported
by Bhattacharya and Krishnan-Ghosh.21 Since
then, various phase-selective organogelators have been developed.22−26 However, most of them have some limitations for real-time use.

Previously, we have reported the phase-selective gelation and fabrication
of nanoporous materials from a hydrophobic peptide.27 Herein, a series of tripeptides containing fenamic acid
and α-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) have been synthesized. Although
fenamic acid has been widely studied in biology,28,29 very little is known about the conformational properties. Aib is
conformationally rigid and helicogenic in nature. Fenamic acid is
also geometrically not very flexible. Hence, the incorporation of
Aib and fenamic acid in a peptide backbone will be done for the molecular
structure as well as for the direction of molecular orientation and
self-assembly (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Chemical structures of α,β-hybrid peptides 1–3 (fenamic acid in red; Aib in black; Phe (for peptide 1) and Tyr (for peptide 2) in violet; and Maba in green).

Results and Discussion
The α,β-hybrid peptides 1–3 were
synthesized by the solution-phase peptide synthesis process using
N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) as a coupling reagent (Figure S1). Fenamic acid was incorporated in
the N-terminus, without any protecting group. Peptide 1 contains l-phenylalanine (Phe), and peptide 2 is a l-Tyrosine (Tyr) analogue of peptide 1. However, peptide 3 contains an m-aminobenzoic
acid (Maba) at the C-terminus. Helicogenic α-amino isobutyric
acid was incorporated to increase the conformational rigidity and
crystallinity. All the synthesized peptides and intermediates were
purified by column chromatography and characterized by Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), 1H nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR), 13C NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry.

We have used different spectroscopic techniques to study the self-assembly
propensities of the α,β-hybrid peptides 1–3 in solution. The solution-state UV/vis experiments for peptide 2 show no change of spectral positions for π-to-π*
transition (288 and 338 nm), but absorbance increases with an increasing
peptide concentration in methanol solution (Figure S3). The peptides 1 and 3 show absorption
bands at 288 and 346 nm and 288 and 342 nm, respectively. Here also,
the intensity of absorption increases with the corresponding increase
in peptide concentration in methanol solution (Figures S2 and S4), without any band shift. On excitation
at 338 nm, peptide 2 exhibits emission peaks at 410 and
427 nm (Figure S3). From Figure S3, it is observed that the intensity of emission increases
with the increasing peptide concentration in methanol solution. Peptides 1 and 3 also show similar emission properties
(Figures S2 and S4).

The morphology of the α,β-hybrid peptides was examined
by polarized optical microscopy (POM). The POM images show that peptides 1 and 2 have microsphere morphology, but peptide 3 depicts branched fibril-like morphology (Figure S5). Further, field emission scanning electron microscopy
(FE-SEM) was performed. For FE-SEM measurements, dilute solutions
(0.5 mM) of the corresponding peptides 1–3 were
drop-casted on clean microscopic glass slides and carefully dried
under a vacuum for 48 h. Figure 2 exhibits the FE-SEM images of the peptides 1–3. From Figure 2a,b,
it is observed that the peptides 1 and 2 show polydisperse microsphere morphology. The average diameter of
the microspheres is ca. 500 nm for peptide 1 and ca.
200 nm for peptide 2. From Figure 2c,d, it is observed that peptide 3 exhibits an entangled fibril-like morphology. The diameter of the
fibrils is ca. 1 μm and the length is of several micrometers.

Figure 2 FE-SEM images of (a) peptide 1 showing polydisperse
microsphere morphology, (b) peptide 2 showing polydisperse
microsphere morphology, and (c,d) peptide 3 showing entangled
fiber-like morphology.

To know the information about the backbone structure and the self-assembly
patterns of peptides, FT-IR spectroscopy was performed. The α,β-hybrid
peptide 1 exhibits N–H stretching vibrations at
3305 cm–1 and amide I and amide II peaks at 1664
and 1602 cm–1.30 However
the α,β-hybrid peptide 2 shows N–H
stretching vibration at 3308 cm–1 and amide I and
amide II peaks at 1670 and 1601 cm–1 (Figure 3).21 The α,β,γ-hybrid peptide 3 exhibits
N–H stretching vibration at 3315 cm–1 and
amide I and amide II peaks at 1669 and 1590 cm–1. For peptides 1 and 2, the peak at 3429
cm–1 indicates that all N–H’s are
not hydrogen-bonded.

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis was performed to explore
the backbone conformation and self-assembly pattern of the fenamic
acid-containing α,β-hybrid peptides 1–3. Colorless monoclinic crystals of peptide 1 suitable
for X-ray crystallography were obtained from methanol–water
solution by slow evaporation. There is one molecule of peptide 1 in the asymmetric unit (Figure 4a). The peptide 1 adopts an
“S”-shaped conformation and is stabilized by two consecutive
intramolecular N–H···N hydrogen bonds (Figure 4a). A strong π–π
stacking interaction (shortest C–C distance of 3.20 Å)
also stabilized the “S”-shaped conformation. The ϕ
and ψ values of the Aib residues are in the right-handed helical
region of the Ramachandran diagram. In higher-order assembly, the
peptide 1 molecules self-assemble through multiple N–H···O
intermolecular hydrogen bonds to form a parallel sheet-like structure
(Figure 4b). Table 1 exhibits the crucial
backbone torsion angles of peptide 1. Table 2 shows the hydrogen-bonding
parameters of peptide 1.

Colorless monoclinic crystals of peptide 2 were obtained
from the hexane–dichloromethane (DCM) solution by slow evaporation.
From X-ray crystallography, it is observed that the α,β-hybrid
peptide 2 adopts an “S”-shaped conformation
in solid state. There is one molecule of peptide 2 in
the asymmetric unit (Figure 5a). The ϕ and ψ values of the Aib residues are
in the right-handed helical region of the Ramachandran plot. The important
backbone torsion angles of peptide 2 are listed in Table 1. The “S”-shaped
conformation of peptide 2 is stabilized by consecutive
intramolecular N–H···N and N–H···O
hydrogen bonds (Figure 5a). A strong π–π stacking interaction (shortest
C–C distance of 3.10 Å) also stabilized the “S”-shaped
conformation. In higher-order packing, the peptide 2 molecules
self-assemble to form a parallel sheet-like structure (Figure 5b) through intermolecular O–H···O
hydrogen-bonding interactions. The hydrogen-bonding parameters of
peptide 2 are listed in Table 2.

Hydrogen bonds are marked as dotted lines.

The colorless monoclinic crystals of peptide 3 were
obtained from acetonitrile solution by slow evaporation. There are
two molecules of peptide 3 in the asymmetric unit (Figure 6). The ϕ and
ψ values of the Aib residue of molecule A are in the right-handed
helical region, whereas the ϕ and ψ values of the Aib
residue of molecule B are in the left-handed helical region of the
Ramachandran diagram. Table 1 exhibits the crucial backbone torsion angles for the molecules
A and B of peptide 3. The “S”-shaped conformation
of peptide 3 molecules is stabilized by consecutive intramolecular
six-member N–H···O and five-member N–H···N
hydrogen bonds (Figure 6). Strong π–π stacking interactions (shortest
C–C distances are 3.19 Å for molecule A and 2.90 Å
for molecule B) also stabilized the “S”-shaped conformations.
Moreover, the duplex is also stabilized by intermolecular N–H···O
hydrogen bonds between fenamic acid C=O and Aib NH and Aib
C=O and Maba NH (Figure 6). Table 2 exhibits
the hydrogen-bonding parameters of peptide 3.

peptide 3 molecules in the asymmetric unit. To visualize
and understand, the different peptide 3 units appeared
with different colors. Hydrogen bonds are shown as dotted lines.

In higher-order packing, the peptide 3 duplexes further
self-assembled through multiple intermolecular π–π
stacking interactions to form a two-dimensional layer structure (Figure 7) along crystallographic a and c directions.

the crystallographic a and c directions.

The α,β-hybrid peptides 1–3 failed
to form an organogel. The α,β-hybrid peptides 1–3 form a clear solution on heating in aromatic solvents such as toluene,
benzene, xylene, chlorobenzene, 1,2-dichlorobenzene, and nitrobenzene
and precipitated out of the solution on cooling. Even the α,β-hybrid
peptides 1–3 do not form a gel in an organic solvent
at a very high concentration on sonication. However, peptide 3 was found to from a gel in an organic solvent and water
mixture. In a usual procedure, a mixture of 1 mL of xylene and 1 mL
of water was shaken in a test tube, and 25 mg of peptide 3 was added. The test tube was heated to dissolve the peptide 3 in the organic phase (xylene), followed by vigorous shaking
to make a homogeneous dispersion. Surprisingly, on cooling at room
temperature, the organic phase gelated, entrapping the water phase
inside the test tube (Figure 8). However, the α,β-hybrid peptides 1 and 2 only provide viscous solutions even at very high
concentrations.

Figure 8 α,β,γ-Hybrid peptides (a) 1 and
(b) 2 show viscous solutions in xylene/water mixture.
(c) Inverted vial confirms the phase-selective gelation of α,β,γ-hybrid
peptide 3 from the xylene/water mixture.

The phase-selective gelation of peptide 3 was confirmed
by the inverted test tube method. The phase-selective gel is white,
opaque, and stable for weeks. The phase-selective gel is thermoreversible
in nature. The gel–sol transition temperature (Tgel) of the peptide 3 in xylene increases
with increasing gelator concentration (Figure 9), a characteristic feature of low-molecular-weight
gels.31

Figure 9 Change of gel–sol transition temperature (Tgel) of the peptide 3 in xylene with increasing
gelator concentration.

The morphology of the xerogel was examined by transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) measurements. For TEM experiments, a slice of the
phase-selective gel was placed on a copper grid and finally dried
under a vacuum for 2 days. Figure 10 depicts the TEM images of the peptide 3 xerogel. From Figure 10, it is observed that the peptide 3 xerogel from
xylene exhibits a ribbon-like morphology. The diameter of the ribbon
is ca. 500 nm, and the length is of several micrometers. FT-IR spectroscopy
shows that the backbone structure and the self-assembly pattern of
the α,β,γ-hybrid peptide 3 in xerogel
is almost the same as that in crystal (Figure S6). Hence, on phase-selective gelation, there is no change
of backbone structure.

Figure 10 TEM images of the xerogel of α,β,γ-hybrid peptide 3 from xylene/water mixture showing a ribbon-like entangled
network.

The phase-selective gel of α,β,γ-hybrid peptide 3 is responsive to H2SO4. On dropwise
addition of H2SO4, the gel melts and finally
forms a clear solution in the organic layer. However, the aqueous
layer turns yellowish in color (Figure 11). This is due to the formation of a sulfate
salt of diphenyl amine which is highly soluble in water (Figure S7). The response of the gel to HCl is
comparatively slow. However, acetic acid has no effect on the gel.
This H2SO4-responsive melting of gel is interesting
for oil spill recovery from water. All previous reports used tedious
methods like distillation for oil spill recovery.3233

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have discussed the effect of geometrically rigid
fenamic acid–Aib corner motif in α,β-hybrid peptides.
Though fenamic acid has been widely investigated in biology, very
little is known about its conformational properties. From X-ray single-crystal
diffraction studies, it is observed that the α,β-hybrid
peptide 1 has an “S”-shaped conformation
that is stabilized by two consecutive intramolecular N–H···N
hydrogen bonds. However, the tyrosine analogue α,β-hybrid
peptide 2 has an “S”-shaped conformation,
which is stabilized by consecutive intramolecular six-member N–H···N
and seven-member N–H···O hydrogen bonds. The
asymmetric unit of α,β,γ-hybrid peptide 3 containing Maba has two molecules, which are stabilized by intermolecular
hydrogen-bonding interactions and π–π stacking
of the fenamic acid aromatic rings. The peptides 1 and 2 have polydisperse microsphere morphology, but peptide 3 has entangled fiber-like morphology. Peptides 1–3 do not form an organogel by normal heating–cooling cycle
or sonication. However, in the presence of water, the peptide 3 forms a phase-selective instant gel in xylene. The gel exhibits
high stability and thermal reversibility and is highly sensitive to
H2SO4. This is used in oil spill recovery. This
result is particularly important for the future design of peptides
with meaningful structure/activity relationships.

Fenamic Acid–Aib-Maba-OMe (Peptide 3)
A 500 mg (1.68 mmol) of NPA-Aib-OH wasdissolved in 25 mL of dry
DCM in an ice–water bath. A 0.7 g (3.35 mmol) of DCC was added
in the reaction mixture. H-MABA-OMe was extracted from 0.63 g (3.35
mmol) of the corresponding methyl ester hydrochloride by neutralization
and subsequent extraction with ethyl acetate, and ethyl acetate was
evaporated; then, it was dissolved to dry DCM and added to the reaction
mixture immediately after the addition of DCC. The reaction mixture
was allowed to come to room temperature and stirred for 48 h. Then,
DCM was evaporated, the residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate (60
mL), and DCU was filtered off. A 2 M HCl (3 × 50 mL), 1 M sodium
carbonate (3 × 50 mL), and brine (2 × 50 mL) were used to
wash the organic layer, and the organic layer was dried over anhydrous
sodium sulfate and evaporated in a vacuum to obtain peptide 3 as a solid. Silica gel (100–200 mesh) and hexane–ethyl
acetate (4:1) as an eluent were used for the purification of the compound.

NMR Experiments
All the compounds (1–10 mM)
in DMSO-d6 and CDCl3 solution
are characterized by NMR spectroscopy on a JEOL (400 MHz) spectrometer
or a Bruker (500 MHz) spectrometer. Tetramethylsilane (d = 0.0 ppm) was used as an internal standard.

FT-IR Experiments
All the compounds are characterized
by FT-IR spectroscopy in solid state by forming KBr palette in a PerkinElmer
Spectrum RX1 spectrophotometer.

Absorption Spectroscopy
A UV/vis spectrometer (MAPADA
UV-6300) and a 1 cm path-length quartz cell were used to record the
absorption spectra of the compounds.

Fluorescence Spectroscopy
The fluorescence spectra
were recorded on a JASCO spectrofluorometer (FP-8300) using a quartz
cell having a 1 cm path length; 5/5 slit widths were used.

Mass Spectrometry
All the compounds were characterized
by mass spectrometry on a Waters Corporation Q-Tof Micro YA263 high-resolution
mass spectrometer by electrospray ionization (positive mode).

POM
The morphology of the compounds was determined
by POM images. A small amount of the solution of the compound was
drop-casted on a clean glass slide, dried by slow evaporation, and
then visualized at 40× magnification on an Olympus optical microscope
equipped with a polarizer and a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera.

Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy
The morphologies
of the synthesized peptides were examined by FE-SEM. The peptide solution
was drop-casted on a clean glass coverslip and dried under a vacuum.
The images were captured in an FE-SEM apparatus (Jeol Scanning Microscope-JSM-6700F)
by gold coating.

Gelation
The peptide 3 (25 mg) was mixed
in 1 mL of xylene and 1 mL of water, and gel was obtained by the heating–cooling
technique.

Transmission Electron Microscopy
TEM was performed
to examine the morphology of the synthesized gel of peptide 3. A slice of the phase-selective gel was placed on a clean
copper grid and dried under a vacuum. The images were captured in
a TEM apparatus (JEM2100Plus).

X-ray Crystallography
Diffraction-quality crystals
of peptides 1–3 were obtained from solution by
slow evaporation. Intensity data were collected with Mo Kα (peptide 1 and 2) or Cu Kα (peptide 3) radiation by a Bruker APEX-2 CCD diffractometer. The data were
processed using Bruker SAINT package. The structure solution and refinement
were performed by SHELX97. Refinement of nonhydrogen atoms was performed
using anisotropic thermal parameters. CCDC 197545, 1960546, and 1960544
contain the crystallographic data for the peptides 1–3, respectively.
