Phosphorus-
and silicon-modified graphene oxide was prepared to
improve the thermal stability and flame retardancy properties of epoxy
resin. 9,10-Dihydro-9-oxa-10-phosphaphenanthrene-10-oxide (DOPO) and
vinyltriethoxysilane (VTES) were successfully grafted onto the surface
of graphene oxide (GO) through solvothermal synthesis and hydrolysis–condensation
reaction, respectively. Subsequently, the functionalized graphene
oxide grafted by DOPO and VTES (DOPO–VTES–GO) was incorporated
into the epoxy resin by the solution blending method. The effect of
DOPO–VTES–GO on the thermal stability and flame-retardant
properties of epoxy resin was systematically studied. Thermogravimetric
analysis showed that the thermal stability and char residue yield
of DOPO–VTES–GO/epoxy were increased obviously compared
with those of pure epoxy resin and DOPO–GO/epoxy. Cone calorimeter
test results showed that DOPO–VTES–GO/epoxy had better
flame retardancy than pure epoxy resin and DOPO–GO/epoxy on
reducing the peak of heat release rate, total heat release, and total
smoke production. Furthermore, the char residue after the cone calorimeter
tests was investigated by scanning electron microscopy–energy-dispersive
X-ray spectrometry, Raman spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared
measurements. These results demonstrated that the DOPO–VTES–GO
can enhance the graphitization degree of char residues and promote
the formation of the thermally stable char. In addition, the mechanism
of flame retardancy was proposed, and DOPO–VTES–GO exerts
the synergistic effect mainly by means of catalytic charring in the
condensed phase and capturing hydroxyl or hydrogen radicals from thermal
decomposition of epoxy resin in the gas phase. This work provides
novel insights into the preparation of phosphorus–silicon–graphene
oxide ternary synergistic flame retardants for thermosetting polymer
materials.

1 Introduction
Epoxy resin, as one of
the major conventional thermosetting resins,
has wide industrial applications including adhesives,1 coatings,2 electronics,3 aerospace parts,4 and
marine systems,5 owing to its excellent
mechanical strength, superior adhesion, good solvent resistance, and
thermal insulation.6 However, high flammability
has significantly restricted its potential applications. Therefore,
it is necessary to reduce the flammability of epoxy resin.7 Many researchers are devoted to improving the
flame retardancy performance of epoxy through the synthesis of inherently
flame-retardant epoxy resin and/or the addition of flame retardants
in the epoxy matrix.8,9 Among these flame-retardant systems,
halogen-containing flame retardants have been extensively studied
to endow flame retardancy of epoxy resins.10 Unfortunately, the toxic and corrosive gases released by halogenated
flame retardants during combustion are very harmful to the environment
and human health.

Graphene is becoming an attractive halogen-free
flame retardant
for epoxy resin due to its two-dimensional carbon layer structure
as a physical barrier to slow the escape of the volatile products.11 However, flame retardancy is not yet satisfactory
by adding individual graphene into the polymer matrix because of its
combustibility in the air atmosphere.12 10-Dihydro-9-oxa-10-phosphaphenanthrene-10-oxide (DOPO) is a highly
effective phosphorus-based flame retardant due to its high thermal
stability and good oxidation resistance.13 Therefore, the synergistic flame retardancy effect of graphene and
DOPO is desirable to overcome this problem.14−16 Liao et al.15 reported that DOPO has been grafted onto the
surface of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to develop a synergistic DOPO–rGO
flame retardant, and the addition of DOPO–rGO improves the
thermal stability and limiting oxygen index of epoxy resin. Luo et
al.16 developed DOPO–rGO by grafting
DOPO onto the surface of GO, then used it as a flame retardant to
improve the flame retardancy of epoxy resin, and the result showed
that the heat release rate and total heat release (THR) of epoxy filled
with DOPO–rGO were dramatically decreased compared with pure
epoxy, indicating that DOPO–rGO could impart better flame-retardant
properties to epoxy resin.

Unfortunately, both oxygen-containing
groups on the surfaces of
graphene oxide and phosphorus–oxygen groups in the DOPO tend
to decompose earlier than epoxy resin during combustion, which seriously
reduces the thermal stability of epoxy resin.17 To overcome these drawbacks, surface modification of GO has drawn
the attention of many researchers. Wang et al.18 synthesized a novel graphene-based hybrid consisting of
graphene and nanosilica to alleviate the thermal-oxidation degradation
of the graphitic structure. The hybrid can be transformed into silica
nanosheets with high resistance to oxidative degradation at high temperature,
which can delay the thermal degradation of the polymer chain segments
during the combustion process. However, the effect of the graphene-based
hybrid flame retardant on smoke production of epoxy resin during combustion
has not been studied. Qian et al.19 prepared
a novel flame-retardant additive by reacting rGO with (3-isocyanatopropyl)triethoxysilane
and DOPO via a sol–gel process, which exhibited a significant
improvement in the thermal stability and flame retardancy of epoxy
resin. Unfortunately, the synthesis process of the flame retardant
was a complex and time-consuming process.

In this work, we developed
an effective synthesis method for the
functionalized graphene oxide containing phosphorus and silicon elements.
The functionalized graphene oxide with DOPO and vinyltriethoxysilane
(DOPO–VTES–GO) was synthesized by a solvothermal method
and the following hydrolysis–condensation reaction approach.
In the solvothermal process, DOPO was grafted onto GO through the
chemical reaction of the P–H group with the epoxy groups. In
the subsequent hydrolysis–condensation process, the reaction
between the −Si–OH group of hydrolyzed VTES and hydroxyl
groups of GO happened. Transmission electron microscopy–energy-dispersive
X-ray spectrometry (TEM–EDS) and Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectroscopy confirmed the successful grafting of the DOPO
and VTES onto the surface of GO. The thermal stability and flame retardancy
properties of the DOPO–VTES–GO/epoxy composite were
investigated by means of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and limiting
oxygen index and cone calorimeter tests. Moreover, the flame retardancy
mechanism was explored by the aid of scanning electron microscopy–energy-dispersive
X-ray spectrometry (SEM–EDS), Raman spectroscopy, and FTIR
analysis.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization
of DOPO–GO and DOPO–VTES–GO
Flame Retardants
As illustrated in Scheme 1, in the reaction process for the surface
grafting of VTES on the GO surface, there are two main steps: (1)
VTES hydrolysis to produce hydrolyzed VTES in acid solution, (2) hydroxyl
groups of hydrolyzed VTES can react with hydroxyl groups on the surface
of GO nanosheets through the condensation reaction process. Besides,
the self-condensation reaction happens between hydrolyzed VTES grafted
on the GO surface and free hydrolyzed VTES to form siloxane or poly(siloxane)
bonds. TEM measurements have been conducted to investigate the morphologies
of the GO, DOPO–GO, and DOPO–VTES–GO, as shown
in Figure 1a–c,
respectively. GO exhibits a crumpled nanostructure with very thin
features, and most parts of the GO sheets are very smooth (Figure 1a). However, the
morphologies of DOPO–GO and DOPO–VTES–GO show
rough surfaces, as shown in Figure 1b,c, respectively. It is obvious that pebblelike DOPO
nanoparticles are homogeneously decorated on the GO surface. After
the surface grafting of VTES on the GO surface, there are many poly(siloxane)
bonds on the GO surface due to the self-condensation reaction of hydrolyzed
VTES. Previous studies have shown that hydrogen bonding can be formed
to produce silane nanoballs when two poly(silanol) rings are close
to each other,20 and silica nanoballs were
synthesized using organosilane precursors.21,22 The GO nanosheets can provide reaction sites for the formation of
silane nanoballs. For the TEM image of DOPO–VTES–GO
(Figure 1c), it can
be seen that a few silane nanospheres are distributed on the surface
of GO.

Flame Retardant
It can also be easily
observed that amounts of small balls are
uniformly dispersed on the surface of DOPO–VTES–GO.
EDS analyses revealed the elemental compositions of the GO, DOPO–GO,
and DOPO–VTES–GO, as shown in Figure 1d–f, respectively. In Figure 1d, it can be seen that the
contents of carbon and oxygen are 74.7 wt % and 25.3 wt % in the GO,
respectively. The existence of oxygen is attributed to the oxygen-containing
groups on the surface of GO. As shown in Figure 1e, the DOPO–GO contains C, O, and
a small number of P, indicating that DOPO was grafted onto the surface
of GO. The grafting ratio of DOPO on the surface of GO was calculated
as 16.0 wt %. In addition, Figure 1f displays that Si element is detected in DOPO–VTES–GO,
and the weight percentages of C, O, P, and Si were 77.6, 20.8, 1.2,
and 0.4 wt %, respectively. The presence of P and Si elements confirmed
the successful grafting of DOPO and VTES onto the surface of GO.

FTIR spectra are often employed to confirm the presence of characteristic
functional groups. Figure 2 shows the FTIR spectra of GO, DOPO, DOPO–GO, VTES,
and DOPO–VTES–GO. It can be seen in Figure 2a that the absorption peaks
at 3300–3500 cm–1 (the O–H stretching
vibration of −OH groups), 1732 cm–1 (the
C=O stretching vibration of carboxyl groups and carbonyl groups),
1627 cm–1 (the stretching vibration of sp2 hybridized carbon), and 835 cm–1 (C–O vibrations
of epoxy groups) reveal typical characteristic functional groups of
GO.23 From the spectrum of DOPO (Figure 2b), the bands at
2381, 1442, 1221, and 756 cm–1 were assigned to
the stretching vibrations of the P–H, P–Ph, P=O,
and P–O–Ph, respectively. The FTIR spectrum from the
DOPO–GO (Figure 2c) exhibited three characteristic peaks at 1435, 1210, and 755 cm–1, indicating the presence of the P–Ph, P=O,
and P–O–Ph, respectively. It was also observed that
the peak intensity of the epoxy groups for DOPO–GO decreased
significantly, and the P–H group disappeared, which proved
the successful grafting of DOPO onto GO through the chemical reaction
of the P–H group with the epoxy ring and carbonyl groups. In Figure 2d, several characteristic
peaks of the VTES groups appeared at the bands of 2977 cm–1 (C–H vinyl stretching), 1598 cm–1 (C=C
stretching), and 1080 cm–1 (Si–O–C
stretching), which was in agreement with the previous report.24 Additionally, it can be seen that several absorption
peaks at 1591 and 1108 cm–1 appear in the spectrum
of DOPO–VTES–GO, which are attributed to the C=C
stretching vibrations and Si–O–C stretching vibrations,
respectively.25 Meanwhile, the typical
hydroxyl group peak at 3300–3500 cm–1 becomes
very weak, suggesting that the reaction between the −Si–OH
group of hydrolyzed VTES and hydroxyl groups of GO happens. These
results suggested that GO was successfully grafted by DOPO and VTES
(Table 1).

and (e) DOPO–VTES–GO.

The thermal stability of the samples was systematically
investigated
by TG analysis under the nitrogen atmosphere, as shown in Figure 3. The initial decomposition
temperature (Ton, 5% weight loss), the
maximum degradation rate temperature (Tmax), and the char residue at 700 °C are obtained from the TG and
differential thermogravimetry (DTG) curves and listed in Table 2. As presented in Figure 3 and Table 2, it can be observed that GO
is not thermally stable and the main weight loss of GO was found at
150–300 °C because of the decomposition of labile oxygen-containing
functional groups. Compared to GO, Ton of DOPO–GO slightly increased (from 172 to 199 °C),
and the char yield of DOPO–GO is higher (from 29.6 to 46.9
wt %), which may be attributed to thermal decomposition of phosphorus-containing
functional groups in the early stages and condensed phase activity.26 After functionalization of GO by DOPO and VTES,
many thermally labile oxygen functional groups were removed, and the Ton and Tmax of DOPO–VTES–GO
were much higher than those of GO. The TG curve of DOPO–VTES–GO
also proves that DOPO and VTES have been successfully grafted on the
surface of GO, which is consistent with the result of the TEM–EDS
and FTIR measurements.

and DOPO–VTES–GO.

2.2 Thermal
Stability Properties of Epoxy Composites
The effect of GO,
DOPO, DOPO–GO, and DOPO–VTES–GO
on the thermal stability of epoxy resin was also studied by TG analysis,
as presented in Figure 4 and Table 2. The
thermal decomposition process of epoxy resin has one stage as the
pure epoxy. The Ton and Tmax of pure epoxy are 352 and 388 °C, respectively.
It is found that the incorporation of 5 wt % GO in epoxy decreased Ton and Tmax by ca.
11 and 7 °C, respectively, in comparison with that of pure epoxy.
The worse thermal stability might be because the GO loading decreases
the cross-link density of the epoxy. DOPO–GO/epoxy displays
a more effective improvement in the char residue from 17.2 to 24.5
wt %, than that of GO/epoxy composite (19.4 wt %), which is mainly
due to the char-forming catalytic effect of phosphates.27,28 It is noticeable that the Ton and Tmax of the DOPO–VTES–GO/epoxy
composite are 345 and 386 °C, respectively, which are close to
the values of the pure epoxy. In addition, the char yield of 5 wt
% DOPO–VTES–GO/epoxy was remarkably increased to 30.2
wt %. which is higher than those of 1.5 wt % nanosilica–GO/epoxy
composite (14.2 wt %)18 and 5 wt % flame
retardants (FRs–rGO)/epoxy composite (19.6 wt %).19 This is mainly attributed to the synergistic
effect of phosphorous and silicon elements, where phosphorous accelerates
the formation of char and silicon enhances the thermal stability of
the char during the thermal degradation process of epoxy resin.29

2.3 Flame
Retardancy Performance of Epoxy Composites
Limiting oxygen
index and cone calorimeter tests are effective
methods to evaluate the flame-retardant properties of polymeric materials
during combustion.30 Therefore, limiting
oxygen index and cone calorimeter tests were adopted to investigate
the combustion behavior of pure epoxy and its composites.

The
LOI values of pure epoxy and its composites are given in Table 2. As shown in Table 2, the LOI value of
pure epoxy was only 19.7%, and it was easy to burn. The LOI value
of GO/epoxy composite showed a slight increase, which is likely attributed
to the physical barrier effect of GO to inhibit the heat and mass
transfer process.31 Obviously, it was found
that the LOI value of the DOPO–GO/epoxy composite was increased
to 24.7%, suggesting a good synergistic effect between DOPO and GO.
This finding is consistent with the previous research work.15 Moreover, as for the DOPO–VTES–GO/epoxy
composite, the LOI value was improved significantly from 24.7 to 27.5%
in comparison with the DOPO–GO/epoxy composite. Therefore,
DOPO–VTES–GO exhibits a better flame-retardant effect
than DOPO–GO, which is probably because the formation of silicon
dioxide with high thermal stability enhances the thermal oxidative
stability of the char layer.30 In our previous
experimental research on the limiting oxygen index test of epoxy composites,
the LOI value of DOPO–VTES–GO/epoxy composites increased
monotonically with DOPO–VTES–GO content, but it was
found that the LOI value showed almost no increase when DOPO–VTES–GO
content was more than 5 wt %. Therefore, the appropriate addition of DOPO–VTES–GO is
5 wt % in the DOPO–VTES–GO/epoxy composite.

The
heat release rate, total heat release, CO production, and total
smoke production curves of pure epoxy and its composites are shown
in Figure 5. Besides,
the selected data obtained from cone calorimeter tests are summarized
in Table 3, including
time to ignition (TTI), peak heat release rate (PHRR), time to peak
heat release (tPHRR), fire growth rate
index (FIGRA), total heat release (THR), average of effective heat
of combustion (AEHC), and total smoke production (TSP). TTI is an
important index to evaluate the combustion performance of materials,
which can be determined by the onset of a heat release rate curve.32 As listed in Table 3, compared to pure epoxy, the TTI of DOPO–VTES–GO/epoxy
was significantly prolonged, which would be beneficial for effective
escape and firefighting.33 As shown in Figure 5a and Table 3, it can be observed that that
pure epoxy burns very rapidly after ignition and the PHRR value is
714.7 kW m–2, which demonstrates the flammability
of pure epoxy. The PHRR values of GO/epoxy and DOPO/epoxy decrease
to 526.8 and 458.6 kW m–2, respectively. With the
incorporation of DOPO–GO, the PHRR for DOPO–GO/epoxy
was further decreased to 384.1 kW m–2, suggesting
the synergistic effect of GO and DOPO on the inhibition of HRR. In
addition, the PHRR value of DOPO–VTES–GO/epoxy significantly
decreased by 45.4% compared to the pure epoxy (from 714.7 to 390.3
kW m–2), indicating the lowest fire hazards among
these samples. Besides, the value (45.4%) is slightly higher than
those of 4 wt % functionalized rGO/epoxy composite (37.7%),12 1.5 wt % nanosilica–GO/epoxy composite
(39%),18 and 5 wt % flame retardants (FRs–rGO)/epoxy
composite (35%).19

The FIGRA
implies the combustion propensity of a material in the
fire, calculated from the ratio of PHRR and tPHRR,34 and is presented in Table 3. With the addition
of DOPO–VTES–GO, the FIGRA value of the epoxy composite
is decreased by 64.1% compared to the pure epoxy (from 5.3 to 1.9
kW m–2 s–1), indicating the delayed
time to flashover and that it has earned precious time for evacuation
and fire fighting.35

As illustrated
in Figure 5b, the THR
values of pure epoxy and its composites show a
similar change trend as the PHRR. The THR value of DOPO–GO/epoxy
composites is lower than those of pure epoxy, GO/epoxy, and DOPO/epoxy
composites, which is attributed to the barrier effect of GO and catalytic
carbonization of DOPO. Interestingly, the THR value of DOPO–VTES–GO/epoxy
is lower than that of the DOPO–GO/epoxy composite and is reduced
to 50.5 MJ m–2, a 41.3% reduction compared to that
of pure epoxy. In addition, the THR value of the DOPO–VTES–GO/epoxy
composite is much higher than that (30.2%) of 4 wt % functionalized
rGO/epoxy composite obtained by in situ polymerization.12 This is mainly because that the high-temperature
resistance effect of char residues was improved with addition of the
silicon-containing flame retardant, which was in accordance with the
TG results.

AEHC is defined as the ratio of the average heat
release rate to
the average mass loss rate from the cone calorimetry test, reflecting
the degree of burning of volatile gases in gas-phase flame during
combustion.36 As shown in Table 3, it can be seen that the AEHC
of GO/epoxy was almost the same as that of pure epoxy, indicating
that GO did not play a role of a flame retardant in the gas phase.
The AEHC of DOPO/epoxy obviously decreased with the addition of DOPO,
indicating that DOPO exerted the flame-retardant effect in the gaseous
phase. With the incorporation of other phosphorus-containing flame
retardants, the AEHC of all of the epoxy composites showed a similar
change. Also, the AEHC of the DOPO–VTES–GO/epoxy composite
was approximately 8% lower than that of the pure epoxy.

Figure 5c shows
the curves of the CO production rate of samples. It can be found that
GO/epoxy can reduce the CO production rate compared with pure epoxy
due to the barrier effect of GO. However, the CO production rate of
DOPO/epoxy was slightly higher than that of pure epoxy, indicating
that there was a catalytic effect of DOPO on the decrease of the CO
production rate.37 Moreover, the CO production
rate of the DOPO–VTES–GO/epoxy composite was significantly
decreased and lower than that of pure epoxy. The smoke production
is also an important parameter to evaluate fire hazards and flame-retardant
properties. It can be seen in Figure 5d and Table 3 that the TSP of DOPO–VTES–GO/epoxy was decreased
by 36% compared with that of pure epoxy resin, indicating that DOPO–VTES–GO
has a strong smoke suppression effect in epoxy composites. Based on
the cone calorimeter analysis, it is worth noting that the trend of
the cone calorimeter results is well consistent with the LOI results.

2.4 Analysis of Char Residues
As shown
in Figure 6, the morphologies
of char residues of pure epoxy and its composites after cone calorimeter
tests were investigated by optical photographs. Obviously, it can
be observed in Figure 6a that the char residue of pure epoxy is cracked and discontinuous
and could not prevent combustible gas from escaping into the atmosphere.
As indicated in Figure 6b,c, the char residue turns more homogeneous and compact with the
incorporation of GO or DOPO in the epoxy matrix. Furthermore, it is
clearly seen that the char residue of the DOPO–VTES–GO/epoxy
composite is much more compact than that of the DOPO–GO/epoxy
composite (Figure 6d,e). The compact char layer can efficiently protect the underneath
epoxy matrix from combustion by restraining the transfer of volatiles
and heat through the barrier effect.

Figure 6 Digital photographs of char residues after
cone calorimeter tests
of (a) pure epoxy, (b) GO/epoxy, (c) DOPO/epoxy, (d) DOPO–GO/epoxy,
and (e) DOPO–VTES–GO/epoxy.

To reveal the flame-retardant mechanism, the micromorphology
and
elemental composition of the combusted residual chars after cone calorimeter
tests were conducted by SEM–EDX, as shown in Figure 7 and Table 4. For pure epoxy, it can be obviously observed
in Figure 7a that the
char layer after combustion displayed a loose and porous structure. Figure 7b shows that the
main component of the residue char was carbon. As shown in Figure 7c, there is a more
compact structure in the residue char of DOPO–GO/epoxy. The
char layer can prevent flammable gas from escaping and reduce heat
transfer during the combustion process. Phosphorus was detected and
oxygen contents were increased, which is because DOPO was combined
with oxygen to generate phosphate compounds.38 Also, this indicated that DOPO plays a flame-retardant role in the
condensed phase. The incorporation of DOPO–VTES–GO in
epoxy can further form a more compact and continuous char layer, reflecting
the physical structure integrity of the char layer. Based on the previous
research, there is a close relationship between flame retardancy and
the structure of residual chars.39 The
compact and continuous char layer could not only reduce the transfer
of combustible gas and oxygen but also have a thermal insulation effect
during combustion.40 A number of silicon
elements were observed in the residual char of DOPO–VTES–GO/epoxy,
which was helpful for improving the thermal stability and physical
integrity of the char together with better flame retardancy.

Raman spectra were used to
characterize the microstructure of chars,
which may provide valuable information for the further study of the
flame-retardant mechanism.41 The degree
of graphitization is a very important structural parameter. Figure 8 presents the Raman
spectra of the residual chars of pure epoxy, DOPO–GO/epoxy,
and DOPO–VTES–GO/epoxy composites after cone calorimeter
tests. As shown in Figure 8a, the spectrum of pure epoxy displays two prominent peaks
at 1351 cm–1 (disordered char) and 1585 cm–1 (graphite), corresponding to D and G bands, respectively. The ratio
of the D and G band intensities (ID/IG) is inversely proportional to the in-plane
crystallite sizes, which is used for estimating the graphitization
degree of the residual char, and a lower ID/IG value means a higher degree of graphitization.42 The ID/IG value of the char for pure epoxy is 2.83. Figure 8b shows a lower ID/IG value of 2.55 with the
addition of DOPO–GO in epoxy resin. The increase of graphitization
degree may be due to the catalytic charring of DOPO–GO. In
addition, the ID/IG value of the char for the DOPO–VTES–GO/epoxy
composite is 2.25. It can be reasonably concluded that DOPO–VTES–GO
not only has good charring ability but also exhibits the ability to
enhance the thermo-oxidative stability of the char layer, resulting
in an improvement of flame retardancy performance.

char residues after cone calorimeter tests

Furthermore, FTIR analysis is
used to investigate the chemical
structure of char residues after cone calorimeter tests for pure epoxy,
DOPO–GO/epoxy, and DOPO–VTES–GO/epoxy composites,
as shown in Figure 9. For the pure epoxy (Figure 9a), the absorbance peak at 1598 cm–1 can
be ascribed to the C=C bond stretching vibration of polyaromatic
carbons.43 Also, the peak at 1053 cm–1 is mainly due to the C=O groups. In the FTIR
spectrum of DOPO–GO/epoxy, the polyaromatic carbon absorbance
at 1598 cm–1 is obviously enhanced, and several
characteristic absorption peaks at 1316, 981, 879, and 753 cm–1 belong to the stretching vibrations of P=O
and P–O–P structures, indicating the formation of phosphate
compounds.38 This result suggests that
polyphosphoric acid was formed during thermal degradation of DOPO–GO/epoxy
and promotes the formation of the carbonaceous char by carbonization.
The FTIR spectrum of the DOPO–VTES–GO/epoxy composite
is similar to that of DOPO–GO/epoxy, and the absorbance at
1000–1100 cm–1 is more obvious, which means
that more Si–O–Si–O and −P(=O)–O–Si–
structures remain in the char layer,44 indicating
an interaction between Si and P elements during the combustion. In
addition, an absorption peak appearing at 801 cm–1 is caused by the Si–O–C deformation vibration and/or
Si–C stretching vibration, which reveals the formation of silica
compounds during the combustion.

2.5 Flame
Retardancy Mechanism
Based
on the above analysis, it is concluded that DOPO–VTES–GO
could significantly improve the flame retardancy of epoxy resin by
synergism of the catalyzing carbonization in the condensed phase and
free-radical quenching in the gas phase, and a possible flame-retardant
mechanism during the combustion is proposed, as shown in Figure 10. The introduction
of GO can reduce the flammable gas permeability during the degradation
of the epoxy molecules. In the decomposition process of DOPO groups
in DOPO–VTES–GO, a phosphorus-rich residue is formed
to promote the formation of char residues.45 A continuous and compact char layer can act as an effective barrier
against heat transmission and gas transport. Meanwhile, PO free radicals
can be released during the degradation process of DOPO and capture
H and OH free radicals generated by thermal decomposition of epoxy
molecular chains, resulting in the chain reaction that sustains combustion
to stop in the gas phase.46 Furthermore,
VTES groups in DOPO–VTES–GO tend to form the thermostable
bridged structure of Si–O–Si, which promotes the formation
of the graphitic structure and enhances the thermostability of char
residues in the condensed phase. Therefore, DOPO–VTES–GO/epoxy
composite exhibits better flame retardancy.

mechanism during the combustion in the
DOPO–VTES–GO/epoxy composite.

3 Conclusions
In this work, a novel DOPO–VTES–GO
was successfully
prepared via a solvothermal and hydrolysis–condensation reaction
approach, which was confirmed by TEM–EDS, FTIR, and TG analyses.
Then, DOPO–VTES–GO was introduced into epoxy resin through
a simple solution mixing method, and the prepared DOPO–VTES–GO/epoxy
composite demonstrated significant improvements in thermal stability
and flame retardancy. With the incorporation of DOPO–GO and
DOPO–VTES–GO, the thermal stability and flame retardancy
properties of epoxy composites were improved. Compared with that of
the DOPO–GO/epoxy, the char residue yield of DOPO–VTES–GO/epoxy
composite was remarkably increased from 24.5 to 30.2 wt %, and the
DOPO–VTES–GO/epoxy composite had a lower THR (from 59.6
to 50.5 MJ m–2) and TSP (from 21.8 to 18.3 m2). Furthermore, char residue analysis suggested that the addition
of DOPO–VTES–GO exhibits an effectively synergistic
effect on flame retardancy of epoxy resin by the combination of the
condensed phase and gas-phase mechanism. This investigation may provide
new insights into the design and synthesis of excellent flame retardants
and their applications in flammable polymer materials.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Natural
flake graphite
powder (purity 99.9%) with an average particle size of 500 mesh was
supplied by Qingdao Xingyuan Graphite Co., Ltd. (Shandong, China).
Concentrated sulfuric acid (98%), sodium nitrate, potassium permanganate,
hydrogen peroxide (30%), hydrochloric acid, anhydrous ethanol, acetic
acid, and acetone all were of analytical reagent grade and purchased
from Chengdu Kelong Chemical Co., Ltd. (Chengdu, China). DOPO was
supplied by Guangdong Wengjiang Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Guangdong,
China). Vinyltriethoxysilane (VTES) was kindly supplied by Qufu Chenguang
Chemical Co., Ltd. (Shandong, China). Epoxy resin (E-51, epoxy value:
0.48–0.54 mol/100 g) was purchased from Hangzhou Wuhuigang
Adhesive Co., Ltd. (Hangzhou, China). 4,4-Diamino-diphenyl methane
(DDM) was obtained from Aladdin Industrial Corporation (Shanghai,
China).

4.2 Preparation of DOPO–GO and DOPO–VTES–GO
Graphite oxide was prepared from natural flake graphite according
to a modified Hummers method,47 and thereafter,
graphene oxide was obtained by ultrasonic stripping of graphite oxide.
Subsequently, DOPO–GO was prepared using a simple solvothermal
method. The detailed process can be described as follows. The as-prepared
graphene oxide (0.1 g), DOPO (0.5 g), and anhydrous ethanol (100 mL)
were mixed and sonicated for 30 min in an ultrasonic bath. After that,
the solution was sealed in a 200 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and maintained
at 85 °C for 10 h. Then, the mixtures were filtered and thoroughly
washed with anhydrous ethanol to remove the residual DOPO. Finally,
the collected DOPO–GO was dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C
overnight to remove the solvent. Then, VTES (1 mL), deionized water
(5 mL), anhydrous ethanol (150 mL), acetic acid (0.2 mL), and DOPO–GO
powders (0.2 g) were introduced into a 250 mL three-necked round-bottomed
flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a reflux condenser. After
stirring for 12 h at 60 °C, a black DOPO–VTES–GO
powder was obtained after washing with anhydrous ethanol and drying
at 50 °C in a vacuum oven. Scheme 1 illustrates the synthesis process of the DOPO–VTES–GO
flame retardant.

4.3 Preparation of DOPO–GO/Epoxy
and DOPO–VTES–GO/Epoxy
Composites
The DOPO–VTES–GO/epoxy composite
was prepared by a solution blending method. A typical procedure to
produce the epoxy composite containing 5 wt % DOPO–VTES–GO
is as follows. DOPO–VTES–GO (3.0 g) was uniformly dispersed
in 100 mL of acetone by 30 min of sonication, and the suspension was
transferred into a 250 mL three-necked flask. Then, epoxy resins (60
g) were added into the three-necked flask under vigorous mechanical
stirring and heated at 60 °C for 6 h to remove acetone. Subsequently,
the curing agent DDM (20 g) was added into the three-necked flask
under vigorous stirring until complete homogeneity. The mixture was
poured into a preheated poly(tetrafluoroethylene) mold and cured at
120 °C for 4 h and then at 160 °C for 2 h. After curing,
the sample was cooled slowly to room temperature and the DOPO–VTES–GO/epoxy
composite was obtained. For comparison, pure epoxy, GO/epoxy, DOPO/epoxy,
and DOPO–GO/epoxy composites were also prepared using the same
method. All of the formations of pure epoxy and epoxy composites are
listed in Table 1.

4.4 Characterization
TEM analyses were
conducted using a JEOL JEM-2100 electron microscope with an accelerating
voltage of 200 kV equipped with an EDAX energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer
(EDS, AMETEK, Mahwah), and the samples for the TEM measurements were
dispersed in anhydrous ethanol under ultrasonication for 20 min and
then dripped onto copper grids for tests. FTIR spectra were recorded
with a resolution of 4 cm–1 using a Tensor 27 FTIR
spectrophotometer (Bruker Company, Germany), and each sample was mixed
with KBr powders and pressed into the tablet for tests. TGA was carried
out using a STA 449 F5 thermoanalyzer instrument (Netzsch Company,
Germany) from room temperature to 700 °C at a heating rate of
10 °C min–1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. The
limiting oxygen index (LOI) test was carried on an HC-2 oxygen index
meter (Jiangning Analysis Instrument Company, China) according to
the ASTM D2863 standard method, and the specimens used were of dimensions
100 × 6.5 × 3 mm3. Cone calorimetry tests were
performed on the cone calorimeter (Fire Testing Technology, U.K.)
according to ISO 5660 standard procedures, and each specimen was prepared
with the dimension of 100 × 100 × 3 mm3, mounted
on an aluminum foil and irradiated horizontally at a heat flux of
35 kW m–2. The morphology and composition of the
char residue after cone calorimetry tests were observed using a Vega3
Tescan scanning electron microscopy (SEM) instrument with an accelerating
voltage of 20 kV and energy disperse X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and
the surfaces of the samples were previously coated with a conductive
layer of gold. Raman spectra were recorded using a LabRAM HR Raman
spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon, France) in the range of 500–2000
cm–1 using a laser wavelength of 632.8 nm.
