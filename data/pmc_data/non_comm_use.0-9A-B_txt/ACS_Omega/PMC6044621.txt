The
five human polycomb (Pc) paralog proteins, chromobox homolog
(Cbx) 2/4/6/7/8, are a family of chromodomain containing methyllysine
reader proteins that are canonical readers of trimethyllysine 27 on
histone 3 (H3K27me3). The aberrant expression of the Cbx7 gene is
implicated in several cancers including prostate, gastric, thyroid,
pancreas, and colon cancer. Previous reports on antagonizing the molecular
recognition of Cbx7–H3K27me3 with chemical inhibitors showed
an impact on prostate cancer cell lines. We report here on the design,
synthesis, and structure–activity relationships of a series
of potent peptidomimetic antagonists that were optimized on a trimethyllysine-containing
scaffold to target Cbx7. The ligands were characterized using fluorescence
polarization (FP) for their binding efficiency and selectivity against
the Pc paralog Cbx proteins. The most selective ligand 9, as indicated by the FP data analysis, was further characterized
using the isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Compound 9 exhibits a 220 nM potency for Cbx7 and exhibits 3.3, 1.8, 7.3 times
selective for Cbx7 over Cbx2/4/8 and 28-fold selective over the HP1
family member Cbx1. Our research provides several potent and partially
selective inhibitors for Cbx2/4/7 that do not contain trimethyllysine.
Our models and binding data suggest that the aromatic cages of Cbx7/Cbx4
can accommodate larger alkyl groups such as diisobutyl substitution
on the lysine nitrogen.

Introduction
Proteins that control
the dynamic state of chromatin are critical
in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression.1 One of the key mechanisms of the epigenetic control of
chromatin is post-translational modifications (PTMs) on histones.
Methylation is among the most common PTMs on the histone side chains
along with acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, and glycosylation.2 Side chains of the lysine residues can be mono-,
di-, or trimethylated.2c,3 Methylation of histone residues
serves as a chemical switch to recruit effector protein complexes
through methyl reader domains. The recruited proteins and multiprotein
complexes influence the accessibility of DNA to transcriptional factors,
which in turn regulate gene expression. The degree and the site of
methylation determine which reader protein is recruited and ultimately
the biological outcome, such as the activation or repression of gene
expression.3

Methyllysine reader
proteins have diverse roles in the development,
cell-cycle regulation, and oncogenesis.4 Chromodomains are a family of methyllysine reader proteins that
include the polycomb (Pc) paralog proteins, chromobox homolog (Cbx)
2/4/6/7/8, that recognize trimethyllysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K27me3).5 A closely related family, the heterochromatin
protein 1 (HP1) paralogs consist of Cbx1/3/5 and recognize trimethyllysine
9 on histone 3. Pc group proteins play essential roles in the cell
cycle control, maintenance of differentiation status during development,
stem-cell self-renewal and maintenance, and cancer progression.6 The chromodomain of Cbx7 (ChD Cbx7) has been
the primary focus of biological research into the roles of Pc paralog
proteins. The role of Cbx7 in disease pathogenesis is varied. Cbx7
plays a dual role as both an oncosuppressor and an oncogene, and its
functions depend on cell specificity and tissue specificity and are
defined by epigenetic factors such as interacting partners within
the specific tissue environment. Upregulation of
Cbx7 expression is observed in prostate, gastric, and lymphatic cancer.7 Conversely, reduced Cbx7 expression was shown
to correlate with a high grade of tumors in thyroid, pancreatic, breast,
colon, and lung carcinomas.8 Unlike in
other cancers, the molecular basis of Cbx7 involvement in prostate
cancer has been well established. Cbx7 epigenetically represses the
INK4a/Arf locus through its chromodomain by binding to the long noncoding
RNA ANRIL and H3K27me3 present at the locus. Disrupting the interactions
of H3K27me3 with Cbx7 by the mutagenesis of key residues diminishes
the transcriptional repression of Cbx7 at the INK4a locus and has
profound effects on the progrowth phenotype of Cbx7 expression in
this model. In normal and prostate cancer cells, Cbx7 extends cellular
life span and increases cell growth through the regulation of genes
at the Ink4a/Arf locus.9 In prostate cancer
cell lines, Cbx7 downregulates p16 expression, leading to tumorgenesis.7a,7b,9 Given the established role of
Cbx7 in prostate cancer cells, chemical agents that selectively target
the ChD Cbx7–H3K27me3 interaction are proposed to be therapeutically
beneficial.

Selectively targeting a single Pc paralog is challenging
because
of the high degree of sequence homology within the family (Figure 1a).5b The ligands are bound as the central strand in a three-stranded
beta sheet. The binding pockets include an aromatic cage that binds
the Kme3 residue, a small hydrophobic pocket that binds the residue,
that is, the N-terminal of two residues to the Kme3 ((−2) pocket),
and a shallow, extended β-groove that accommodates the ligand
residues from the (−3) position onward.

Figure 1 Structural similarities
and differences among the chromodomains
of Pc paralogs. (a) Overlay of Pc Cbx proteins. Cbx2 is shown in red
(pdb code 3H91), Cbx4 in magenta (pdb code 38IZ), Cbx6 in marine blue (pdb code 3I90), Cbx7 in light
pink (pdb code 4MN3), and Cbx8 in green (pdb code 3I91). (b) Comparison of the aromatic cages
of Pc Cbx proteins in the presence of their native ligand Kme3, with
an exception for Cbx4 that does not have a cocrystal structure with
the Kme3 side chain. (c) Overlay of residues lining the (−2)
pocket of Pc Cbx proteins. The figure was created using the PyMOL
visualization software.12

The structural similarities and differences among
chromodomains
vary according to the binding subsites. The aromatic cage residues,
Phe 11, Trp 32, and Trp 35, are highly conserved (Figure 1b). The Trp 35 in Cbx 2/4/6/7/8
is replaced with the less-electron-rich phenylalanine residue in the
HP1 family (not shown). This tryptophan/phenylalanine swap is a possible
determinant for selectivity between the two families, in addition
to the other structural differences distal to the aromatic cage that
have been described.5b Efforts to make
Cbx-selective inhibitors have therefore mainly depended on the (−2)
pocket and on the differences in the extended β-groove of the
protein. The (−2) pocket is buried under the side-chain-clasping
bridge of the hydrophobic residues Val 10/Leu 49. These hydrophobic
clasp residues (Val 10/Leu 49) of the Pc group are replaced with polar
residues in HP1 (glutamic acid/aspartic acid).5b This switch influences the selectivity of the side chains
of the residues at the (−1) and (−3) positions of the
ligand. The floor of the (−2) pocket is defined by Val 13 in
Cbx7/Cbx4, which is replaced by an Ala 13 residue that creates a larger
(−2) pocket in Cbx2/6/8 (Figure 1c). The HP1 paralogs Cbx1/3/5 also have a Val 13 residue
in the corresponding position (not shown). Substitution of a larger
group in the (−2) pocket was recently shown to confer good
selectivity for Cbx6 over all other Pc and HP1 paralogs.10 Although significant structural differences
exist in the extended β-groove portion of the Cbx proteins,
little is known of how this region affects the selectivity among Cbx
proteins.11

An additional challenge
in targeting the Pc proteins is the induced-fit
mechanism of the substrate binding.5b,13 Ligand-free
structures for Cbx proteins are very different than the ligand-bound
structures for Cbx proteins (not shown). Whereas the H3K27me3-bound
structures overlay very well (see Figure 1), the structures of Cbx7 cocrystallized
with different inhibitors are more structurally divergent—especially
in the ligand-binding aromatic cage region—demonstrating that
the proteins can adopt multiple competent binding conformations. Probably
for this reason, virtual screens have not yet yielded any chromodomain
inhibitors.11

Successful approaches
to Cbx7 inhibition have been driven by peptide-driven
approaches or by high-throughput screening. We first reported on the
200 nM peptidomimetic antagonists of Cbx7,11 which was followed by the development of a potent (97 nM) cell-active
inhibitor UNC3866 by the Frye group.13c Frye and James recently reported a one-bead-one-compound combinatorial
approach that retargeted peptidic compounds toward the CDY family
of chromodomains.14 The group of Zhou published
an HTS-derived small-molecule inhibitor for Cbx7 with a 29 μM
affinity, and 3-fold and >10-fold selectivity over Cbx4 and Cbx2/6/8,
respectively. The authors showed transcriptional derepression of the
p16 gene in PC3 cancer cells upon their treatment with the inhibitor
MS37452 at 500 μM.15 The weaker binding
of MS37452 to Cbx7 is due to MS37452 occupying only two binding pocket
subsites, the aromatic cage and the partly solvent-exposed (−1)
pocket of Cbx7. A follow-up report on an extended analog, engaging
the hydrophobic (−2) pocket, showed improved affinity.16

We report here our own efforts to obtain
an improved potency and
selectivity for Cbx7. We used the existing peptidic scaffold for inhibitor
development because it addresses all binding subpockets and because
it has been demonstrated as the most potent cell-active tool against
Cbx7. The ligand’s alanine, which engages the (−2) pocket,
was maintained because we already showed separately that inhibitors
with larger elements in this position lose affinity for Cbx7 and are
reprogrammed for the selective inhibition of Cbx6.10,11 We focused on two key binding regions that have limited a structure–activity
relationship (SAR) established for potency and Cbx paralog selectivity:
the aromatic cage and the extended β-groove. On the basis of
the binding profiles and structural features of Cbx proteins, we hypothesized
that targeting these regions would create agents with strong selectivity
for Cbx7. In the end, we generated new SAR for agents that lean toward
different subsets of members within the whole Pc family and that provided
good selectivity over its closest relative Cbx4 but did not provide
exclusive selectivity for Cbx7.

Results and Discussion
We have established a fluorescence polarization (FP) assay using
a panel of Cbx Pc proteins that include Cbx 2/4/6/7/8 and the HP1
paralog Cbx1. These assays were initially developed with the native
H3K27me3 ligand, but the low inherent potency of this complex (Kd values between 6 and 36 μM for different
Cbx proteins: Table 1) made studies with more potent compounds run against the tight-binding
limit for the assay for some Cbx proteins, but not for other Cbx proteins.17 To
enable competitive FP against the entire panel of proteins, we developed
and used a probe (1), that is, a promiscuous binder across
the whole test set of proteins (Figures 2 and 3).10

Ligand-optimization efforts were
initiated based on the core structure
(2) (Figure 4). Compound 2 binds to Cbx7 with 0.22 μM
potency and exhibited 2.1/3.9/9.1/30-fold selectivity against Cbx2/4/6/8,
respectively and achieved a 36-fold selectivity against HP1 homolog,
Cbx1.

Figure 4 Design of potent and selective Cbx7 inhibitors with N-terminus
and Kme3 substitutions on the parent scaffold (2).

Replacements for the N-terminal p-bromobenzamide
group of 2 involved a selection of substituted benzoic
acids. Tertiary amine replacements of the Kme3 group involved a variety
of di-alkyl substituents on the lysine nitrogen (Figure 4).

We envisioned that
replacements to the N-terminal group of the
ligand that engages the extended β-groove would improve the
potency and selectivity for Cbx7. We first explored changing the position
of bromine on the N-terminal phenyl group followed by substitution
with different electron-donating, electron-withdrawing, and hydrophobic
groups. Different choices of substituents were made to expand on the
existing results by systematically exploring the substituent size,
geometry, and chemistry. Synthesis was achieved on the solid phase,
by treatment with different benzamides as the end-capping group (Scheme 1a). Selected replacements
and binding affinities of the N-terminal group are presented in Table 2. The Supporting Information contains the synthesis
and characterization data for all compounds.

a Binding data determined
from the
inhibitor concentration needed to half-dissociate the Cbx7–compound 1 complex. Data are the averages of two or three independent
experimental trails and expressed as IC50 ± standard
error in μM. FP data obtained upon titrating varied concentrations
of inhibitors into a fixed concentration of Cbx protein and compound 1. Buffer used in the FP experiments is the same as reported
in Table 1. The concentration
of compound 1 is 100 nM. The concentrations used for
Cbx1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 are 10, 1, 1, 1, 0.4, and 7 μM respectively.
NA = not applicable, that is, compounds were not tested.

The compounds were all tested by
a competitive FP assay using probe 1 and recombinant,
purified Cbx chromodomains (see the Supporting Information). IC50 values
for the disruption of the Cbx–probe complexes were determined
using XLFit and are reported in Tables 2, 3, and 4.

Changing the bromo to the meta/ortho position of the N-terminal phenyl group of 2 reduced
the selectivity for Cbx7 and lowered the binding affinity to all Cbx
proteins tested. The meta bromo substitution (3) lowered the binding affinity by 21-fold for Cbx7, 5.1-fold
for Cbx2, and ∼2-fold for Cbx4/6. The ortho bromo substitution (4) was detrimental for Cbx7/Cbx2. Meta or ortho substitutions did not significantly
influence binding to Cbx1/8. General potency trends observed for the
bromo-substituted compounds to Cbx’s is para > meta > ortho. Replacement
of
bromine with a methoxy group reduced the binding affinity to all Cbx
proteins. All analogs with a methoxy substitution (5, 6, and 7) showed a decreased binding affinity
to each Cbx protein, exhibiting the same trend as the bromo compounds
(para > meta > ortho). These results indicate that the bromine in the para position is making interactions with Cbx7 more favorably than it
does with the other paralogs tested.

We hypothesized that the
replacement of the p-bromophenyl
group with the p-bromopyridinium group (11) would improve potency either by accepting a hydrogen bond from
nearby donors or by tuning the electronics of the halogen.18 In doing so, compound 11 resulted
in a 7.3-fold decrease in the potency for Cbx7, 6.6/5.0/4.4/3.5-fold
decrease in the potency for Cbx2/4/6/8, respectively, and 1.5-fold
decrease in the potency for Cbx1.

Replacement of the para bromo group with an iodo
or trifluoromethyl group showed reduced or abolished binding affinity
to all Cbx’s. Replacement with iodine (8) showed
no binding to Cbx7. Replacement with CF3 (9) resulted in a small loss of potency up to 2-fold for each Cbx protein
but showed a slightly improved selectivity for Cbx7 overall. Compound 9 showed a 2.7-fold/9-fold selectivity for Cbx7 over Cbx2/6
and showed 36-fold selectivity over each of Cbx1/8. Compound 9 showed a 5.3-fold selectivity for Cbx7 over Cbx4, which
is the best selectivity achieved for any Cbx7 peptide-based antagonist
against Cbx4 (the chromodomain that is most structurally similar to
Cbx7).11,13c

Substitution with a hydrophobic tert-butyl group
(10), as in UNC3866, improved the potency by ∼1.2
fold to all Pc group Cbxs and showed a 3.1-fold loss to Cbx1. Compound 10 is the most potent compound for Cbx7, is 2.2-, 4.3-, 8.5-,
and 28-fold selective for Cbx7 over Cbx2/4/6/8, respectively, and
is 140-fold selective for Cbx7 over Cbx1.

A variety of quaternary
methylammonium group replacements were
designed with varied size, hydrophobicity, and basicity to explore
binding interactions to the aromatic cages of Cbx proteins (Figure 4). Synthesis of peptides 12–16 was achieved on the solid phase
by N-alkylation following the Mtt deprotection of
the lysine side chain without cleavage from the resin. A reductive
amination was carried out with varying aldehydes added to the free
lysine-ε-NH2 group (see Scheme 1b), and then the synthesis was completed
by cleavage and purification as normal. The results for tertiary ammonium
side chain replacements are shown in Table 3.

a Binding data determined
from the
inhibitor concentration needed to half-dissociate the complex of Cbx7–compound 1. Data are the averages of two or three independent experimental
trails and expressed as IC50 ± standard error in μM.
FP data is obtained upon titrating varied concentrations of inhibitors
into a fixed concentration of Cbx protein and compound 1. Buffer and concentrations of compound 1 and Cbx protein
are as reported in Table 2. NA = not applicable, that is, compounds were not tested.
ND = not determined, that is, compounds were tested but because of
the factors such as aggregation, IC50 values could not
be determined.

The dipropyl-
and dibenyzl-lysine-containing compounds did not
show binding to Cbxs. Compound 15 showed a very weak
binding affinity, >1000 μM, to Cbx7. No change in the FP
signal
was observed during the titration of 14 into Cbx7, which
implies that the compound does not bind to Cbx7. Protein–probe
aggregation was a problem in these studies because of the poor solubility
of the ligands, and this was noted particularly in titrations with
Cbx1/6/8.

Of all replacements tested, the diethyllysine compound 12 was the best-tolerated replacement for the trimethyllysine
(see Tables 3 and 4). Its binding affinity is less than that of the
parent Kme3
compound by 1.5–3.6-fold across the panel. Compound 12 exhibited the strongest binding affinity to Cbx7, but when compared
with the parent compound 2, it was less selective for
Cbx7 against most of the other Cbxs in the panel. The diisobutyl compound 13 showed a small decrease in the binding affinity to Cbx7
and a small increase in the binding affinity to Cbx4. Aggregation
problems with Cbx1/6/8 prevented the determination of binding affinities
and suggested that the solubility was not ideal. Compound 13 was the most potent Cbx4 inhibitor within the series but was not
selective over Cbx7.

Combining the most selective Cbx7 CF3 group with the
best-tolerated Kme3 replacement (compound 16) resulted
in a potent and partially selective Cbx7 inhibitor. Table 4 shows the data for compound 16, along with those
of its three most closely related parent compounds. Compound 16 registered generally lower potencies when compared with
the trimethyllysine-containing parent compound (9) and
also with the closely related diethyllysine analog (12). Compound 16 showed 1.5/3.1/5.7/12-fold selectivity
for Cbx7 over Cbx2/4/6/8, respectively, and 19-fold selective over
Cbx1.

data determined from the
inhibitor concentration needed to half-dissociate the Cbx7–compound 1 complex. Data are the averages of two or three independent
experimental trails and expressed as IC50 ± standard
error in μM. FP data obtained upon titrating varied concentrations
of inhibitors into a fixed concentration of Cbx protein. Buffer and
concentrations of compound 1, and Cbx protein concentrations
are as reported in Table 2.

Given the low
selectivities (<10-fold within the Pc group) of
ligands by FP and variations in the concentration of each Cbx protein
tested against the ligands, we sought to validate our FP findings
using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) for one representative
compound from each series, using the same recombinant Cbx constructs.
Cbx6 poorly behaved at ITC concentrations and was omitted. We targeted
compounds 9 and 16 for ITC titrations, each
of which have a hydrophobic CF3 group that leads to strong
binding. We could not perform ITC with 16 because at
the working concentrations of ligand, we encountered solubility problems
in either dissolving the compound or precipitation during the titration
of inhibitor into protein. ITC data of compound 9 presented
in Table 5 show that
compound 9 binds to Cbx7 with a Kd value of 0.22 μM and 3.3-, 1.8-, 7.3-fold selective
for Cbx7 over Cbx2/4/8 and 28-fold over Cbx1. Ligand-binding events
with each Cbx protein registered favorable negative enthalpies and
unfavorable entropies. There are strong signs of enthalpy–entropy
compensation when comparing the binding of compound 9 to one protein or another, but we have insufficient structure-function
data to comment in detail on the thermodynamics of binding across
the series. Overall, the binding affinity trends of Cbx paralogs determined
using FP and ITC are similar. There is a significant deviation between
the IC50 and Kd values for
Cbx8 and Cbx1. This is because of the weaker binding affinity of these
proteins to probe peptide 1, which ultimately leads to
differences in the binding affinity determined using FP. Although
probe peptide 1 is an improvement over earlier probes,
with higher affinities that are relatively similar across the panel
of Cbx proteins, these results suggest that FP data comparison in
these studies is quantitative only for Cbx proteins and ligands in
which the affinities are not near the tight-binding limit.17

The Frye
group recently reported the Cbx7 inhibitor UNC3866, which
is an analog of compound 2 and is similar to compounds 12 and 16 (Figure 5a). The key differences are methyl ester as the C-terminus,
leucine side chain at the (−1) position, and para t-butyl group at the N-terminus. To fully understand the SARs of our
inhibitors, we carried out molecular modeling studies based on the
X-ray cocrystal structures of the peptidic ligand Ac-FAYKme3S-NH2 with Cbx711 as well as UNC3866
with Cbx2/4/7/8.13c The all-atom MAB force
field as implemented in MOLOC was used for energy minimizations and
qualitative comparisons.19 The cocrystal
structures revealed that UNC3866 makes similar interactions with the
chromodomains of Cbx2/4/7/8 at the N-terminus, diethyllysine side
chain, and the C-terminus portions of the ligand. The energy-minimized
MOLOC model of the diethyllysine-containing compound, 12, was overlaid with UNC3866 in Cbx7, as shown in Figure 5b, and the model suggests that
the backbones are highly aligned. Similar to that of Ac-FAYKme3S-NH2, the backbone of UNC3866 adopts a beta-strand conformation
and is participating in an extensive backbone-to-backbone antiparallel
β-sheet-like hydrogen-bonding network with the strands of Cbx7
on either side (Figure 5c). The N-terminal tert-butylbenzamide portion of
the ligand is partly embedded in a solvent-exposed cleft, which is
formed by the Asp 50, Arg 52, and Leu 53 residues of the protein (Figure 5d). The shallow cleft
is defined by one wall that is formed by a flat salt bridge between
the side chains of Asp 50 and Arg 52. We conclude from the increasing
potency in going from MeO to Br to t-Bu (5 to 2 to 10), and also from the comparison
of benzene versus pyridine (2 vs 11), that
the hydrophobic interactions are of main importance for this binding
element. The charged Arg–Asp salt bridge would seem an unlikely
platform for the hydrophobic interactions, but in fact the faces of
such salt bridges have been demonstrated to be key hydrophobic-binding
elements in model systems20 and in protein
structural surveys.21 The motif D-L-R in
the extended β-groove of Pc proteins interacts with the tert-butylbenzamide group and is replaced by C-E/D-L in
the HP1 group. This swap abolishes the salt bridge present in the
Pc proteins that contributes to the selectivity of inhibitors for
Pc proteins against HP1 proteins.

The binding affinity results show that the para position is in the best orientation to be embedded in the extended
β-groove of Cbx proteins. The models suggest that this simply
minimizes steric repulsions that are introduced by substitutions at
the ortho/meta positions (Figure 5d–f). This
explains higher potencies to all Cbxs for para-substituted
compounds compared with those of the ortho-/meta-substituted analogs. The only exception to this rule
in the whole data set is that the meta-substituted
compound 6, which binds 1.6-fold stronger to Cbx2 than
its para-substituted counterpart 5.
The models show that one binding orientation for the meta-substituent in compound 3 could be directed away from
the steric clashes with the cleft (Figure 5g), and we propose that this mode is more
accessible for Cbx2 than for the other Cbx proteins.

The diethyllysine
side chain is tolerated similarly in the aromatic
cages of all Cbx proteins. The diethyllysine side chain of UNC3866
was first modeled and found to be favoring gauche conformation about the Cγ–Cδ bond when the ligand is bound to the Cbx7/Cbx8 proteins. The high-resolution
cocrystal structures13c confirmed the same
conformation as observed with our ligands, as illustrated in Figure 5b. In UNC3866, one
of the ethyl groups on the lysine ε-NH2 group interacts
favorably with the aromatic pocket residues of Cbx, whereas the other
ethyl group is coming out of the pocket. In comparison to adapting
Cγ–Cδ bond in anti conformation,
adapting gauche conformation about the Cγ–Cδ bond shortens the side chain, which helps
to minimize steric clashes in the aromatic cage. Accordingly, all
diethyllysine peptide analogs in Table 3 maintain moderate potency to all Cbx proteins. Larger
alkyl chains such as propyl (15), isobutyl (13), and benzyl groups (14) on lysine have comparatively
more steric hindrance, explaining the reduction in binding affinity.
The basicity of lysine nitrogen decreases in the order diethyllysine
< dipropyllysine < diisobutyllysine < dibenzyllysine, which
also negatively influences binding affinity in addition to the steric
hindrance factor. Unexpectedly, the diisobutyl lysine containing compound 13 still holds some potency against Cbx7 and became relatively
more potent for Cbx4. This can be explained by an energy-minimized
model, which indicates that the binding affinity mostly comes from
the hydrophobic interactions with one of the diisobutyl side chains
of compound 13, and the loss in binding affinity is explained
by the ammonium ion coming out of the aromatic cage because of the
change in torsion angle of the lysine C-alpha (Figure 5h). The overall conclusion for this series
of compounds is that the aromatic cage cannot be used as a source
of selectivity among the Cbx paralogs.

Conclusions
We
report on the inhibitors built from a lead scaffold (2) and selectivity studies against the five Pc paralog proteins. With
a goal of achieving potency and selectivity for Cbx7 over Cbx2/4/6/8
and Cbx1, we synthesized two families of inhibitors by altering the
N-terminal and Kme3 groups of the scaffold. Potent submicromolar Cbx7
inhibitors with partial selectivity were synthesized. ITC data of
compound 9 reveal that the compound binds to Cbx7 with
a Kd value of 220 nM, with a ∼2–7-fold
of selectivity for Cbx7 over other Pc paralogs and >25-fold selectivity
over HP1 paralog, Cbx1. The ITC data of compound 9 also
reveal binding affinity trends that are in line with FP findings but
also suggest some caution in interpreting selectivities obtained from
the FP data quantitatively, especially where the probe peptide binds
more weakly to its target (e.g., Cbx1 and Cbx8).

In spite of
these limitations, some clear conclusions can be drawn
from the FP data. Compounds 10 and 9 are
>4-fold selective for Cbx7 over its closest relative Cbx4. The
same
two compounds show 2–5-fold selectivity across the series of
human Pc paralogs and are very selective for Cbx7 over the HP1 paralog
Cbx1 (>30-fold and >100-fold, respectively). In addition to
tuning
the selectivity toward Cbx7, this series of studies showed some substitutions
that tip the selectivity away from Cbx7 and toward other Cbx proteins.
Compound 10 possesses a t-butyl group
that achieves the highest potency (390 nM) for Cbx2. Compound 13 contains a diisobutyl-substituted lysine side chain and
was the most potent Cbx4 inhibitor (490 nM).

FP is a powerful and
convenient method for high-throughput screening and for detailed studies
on the binding affinity across a panel of proteins. The tight-binding
limit for FP probes is not a problem for the weaker-binding hits,
but the advent of this entire class of submicromolar Cbx inhibitors
requires the creation of even more potent FP probe ligands that are
highly potent across all Cbx proteins. Because the tight-binding limit
also applies to many other binding assays, such potent, promiscuous
probes would be useful for a variety of Cbx-targeted screening techniques.

This study did not produce a single compound that can exclusively
bind Cbx7, but it does provide a set of compounds with different patterns
of affinities in this important but scarcely explored family of targets.
The inhibition of
methyllysine reader proteins is in its infancy, but this can be considered
analogous to the development of kinase inhibitors—almost none
of them are exclusively selective for a single target, and yet their
powerful biological activities arise from their patterns of selectivity
in interesting ways. We will report on the cell-based studies of these
inhibitors in due course.

Experimental Section
Materials
All
N-Fmoc-protected natural
and non-natural amino acids and Rink amide resin were purchased from
Chem-Impex International. Fmoc-l-Lys(Me)3-OH was
purchased from GL Biochem. Substituted benzoic acids used for making
N-terminal modifications were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Matrix
Scientific. Aldehydes used for the synthesis of N-alkylated lysine peptides were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Peptide
Synthesis
Peptide synthesis was carried out
using Fmoc-solid-phase peptide synthesis protocols on Rink amide resin
on a CEM Liberty 1 microwave peptide synthesizer. Peptides were synthesized
at a 0.1 mmol scale on Rink amide resin in dimethylformamide (DMF).
Alternating cycles of Fmoc-deprotection, addition of Fmoc-amino acid,
coupling reagent, and activator base were performed using default
protocols of the instruments. Fmoc-deprotection was performed using
20% piperidine in DMF and amide coupling was performed using 1H-benzotriazol-1-yl[bis(dimethylamino)methylene]oxonium
hexafluorophospate in DMF and N,N-diisopropylethylamine in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone.

All peptides were cleaved from resin by stirring with a solution
of 95% TFA/2.5% dH2O/2.5% triisopropylsilane
for 2 h. The resin was washed with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (3 mL,
3 times). The TFA solution was concentrated in vacuo, and the crude
peptide was precipitated by the addition of cold, anhydrous diethyl
ether. The diethyl ether solution was centrifuged for 10 min at 3700
rpm, and the diethyl ether was decanted. The crude peptide was dissolved
in HPLC-grade H2O/MeCN (concentrations dependent on the
solubility of peptide, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added when
the solubility was poor) and was purified using liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (LC–MS).

All peptides were purified using
LC–MS on preparative Luna
C-18 column (Phenomenex, 5 μm, 21.2 × 250 mm2), using a detector wavelength channel of 254 nM. Peptides were purified
by running a gradient from 90:10 0.1% TFA in H2O/0.1% TFA
in MeCN to 10:90 0.1% TFA in H2O/0.1% TFA in MeCN. Purity
of peptides was determined using LC–MS on the Phenomenex Jupiter
analytical column (Proteo, 4 μm size particles, 250 mm 4.60
mm). Peptides were characterized using low-resolution electrospray
ionization–MS (LR-ESI–MS) and LC–MS.

Synthesis of
N-Terminal Modification Peptides
Substituted
benzoic acids were added to the N-terminal of the peptides on a CEM
Liberty 1 microwave peptide synthesizer. Cleavage and purification
were carried out as outlined in the above-mentioned general procedure
for the peptide synthesis. Compounds 2–11 were synthesized in this fashion.

Synthesis of N-Alkylated Lysine Peptides
Syntheses of compounds 12–16 were
achieved using the general procedure mentioned above. Lysine side-chain
functionalization was carried out using a side-chain Mtt-protected
lysine. Selective deprotection of lysine Mtt group on resin was achieved
by stirring with a solution of 2% TFA/2% triisopropylsilane in dichloromethane
(DCM) (10 mL, 30 min × 2), followed by stirring with a solution
of 3% TFA/3% triisopropylsilane in DCM (10 mL, 25 min), and finally
by stirring with a solution of 5% TFA/5% triisopropylsilane in DCM
(10 mL, 15 min × 2). The resin was washed with CH2Cl2 (10 mL × 3) after each treatment. R–CHO
(10–100 equiv), sodium cyanoborohydride (NaBH3CN)
(10 equiv), glacial acetic acid (1 drop), and DMF (10 mL) were added
to the peptide on resin and stirred at room temperature overnight.
The resin was flushed and washed with DMF (10 mL, 3 times). Again,
R–CHO (10–100 equiv), NaBH3CN (10 equiv),
glacial acetic acid (1 drop), and DMF (10 mL) were added to the peptide
on resin and stirred at room temperature overnight. The resin was
washed with DMF (10 mL × 3) and then with CH2Cl2 (10 mL × 3). Peptide cleavage from resin, purification,
and characterization were performed as outlined above.

Protein Expression
BL21 CodonPlus RIL Eschericia coli cells (Stratagene) were transformed
using Addgene plasmids 25245 (Cbx1), 25158 (Cbx2), 25237 (Cbx4), 25296
(Cbx6), 25241 (Cbx7), and a Cbx8 plasmid donated by Arrowsmith (Structural
Genomics Consortium, Toronto, Canada). E. coli was grown at 37 °C in 2XYT media to OD ≈ 1.8. Temperature
was then dropped to 15 °C for 1 h and then induced with 1 mM
IPTG (Life Technologies). Cultures were left shaking overnight and
then pelleted, resuspended in binding buffer, and frozen the next
day. The chromodomains of Cbx1 (20–73), Cbx2 (8–62),
Cbx4 (8–65), Cbx6 (8–65), Cbx7 (8–62), and Cbx8
(8–61) were overexpressed as N-terminal HisX6-tagged proteins.

Protein Purification
E. coli was lysed by incubating on a rocker for 30 min with a CHAPS/dH2O solution (Biobasic), followed by four short (10–15
s) rounds of sonication using a probe-tip sonicator. Centrifugation
was subsequently performed to remove cell debris. The remaining supernatant
was run through a nickel–nitrilotriacetic acid chelating column
(Qiagen) and then through a Hiload 16/600 Superdex 75 pg size exclusion
column (GE). The FP–LC step performed a buffer exchange into
our “minimal” FP buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris HCl,
250 mM NaCl, and 0.01% Tween-20. After concentrating protein to the
desired concentration using Amicon centrifugal filter units, phenylmethane
sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), dithiothreitol (DTT), and benzamidine were
added to a 1 mM final concentration. Protein purity was assessed using
SDS-PAGE gel. Cbx7 and Cbx8 histidine tags were removed after the
nickel column step. Cleavage was performed overnight with our in-house
TEV protease.

Direct Fluorescence Polarization Assay
Cbx1, 2, 4,
6, 7, and 8 proteins, at maximum concentrations ranging from 120–800
μM, were titrated, in duplicate, into FITC-labeled H3K27me3
or compound 1 at fixed concentrations of 500 and 100
nM, respectively. Both labeled probes were dissolved in distilled
water and stored at −20 °C until use. Cbx proteins with
a low affinity to the particular probe had to be run at higher concentrations
to acquire an accurate Kd value. The assay
was performed on 384-well black NUNC plates with optical bottoms.
Each well contained a final volume of 50 μL at the time of the
read. The buffer used for the assay contained 20 mM Tris–HCl
pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM benzamidine, 1 mM PMSF, and 0.01%
Tween. After performing a serial dilution of Cbx proteins from right
to left on a plate and leaving one buffer well (column 1 of plate)
and one well with no Cbx (column 2 of plate), the plate was incubated
in the dark for 15 min before being read. Plates were read with a
SpectraMax M5 plate reader (molecular devices) with λexc 450 nm, λobs 530 nm, and an instrument cutoff of
515 nm. The FP read yielded values for parallel (S) and perpendicular
(P) light emission.

Competitive Fluorescence Polarization Assay
The competitive
assay was performed in duplicate using 96-well black plates (NUNC).
Compound 1 was dissolved in water and stored at −20
°C until use. The buffer used for the assay contained 20 mM Tris–HCl
pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM benzamidine, 1 mM PMSF, and 0.01%
Tween. Various concentrations of inhibitors dissolved in water (N-alkylated lysine compounds needed up to maximum 10% DMSO
to completely dissolve) were titrated into a set concentration of
compound 1 (100 nM) + Cbx protein of interest (Cbx 1,
2, 4, 6, 7, and 8). The maximum concentration that the inhibitor was
titrated at varied from 1.2 mM to 10 μM. The set concentrations
for Cbx proteins were 10 μM (Cbx1), 1 μM (Cbx2, 4, and
6), 0.4 μM (Cbx7), and 7 μM (Cbx8). All wells had a final
volume of 100 μL. Plates were incubated in the dark for 15 min
after the dilutions. The reads and data analysis were performed in
the same manner as for direct FP. Many of the inhibitors required
up to 10% DMSO to properly dissolve. Separate competitive FP assays
were performed with a known medium strength binder of Cbx7 titrated
into compound 1 + Cbx7, with the inhibitor dissolved
in various percentages of DMSO. This assay showed that the 10% DMSO
would be tolerated without significantly affecting the IC50 values (data not shown).

Fluorescence Polarization Data Analysis
Microsoft Excel
was used to determine the averaged P and S values, minus values for
buffer control wells, for each data point. Millipolarization (mP)
units were calculated using the formula [(S – P)/(S + P)] ×
1000, and the resulting data were plotted with a curve-fitting add-in
for Excel (XLFit) using the equation {C + [(BLmax × x)/(Kd + x)]}. In some instances, the data points for
the highest inhibitor concentrations had to be excluded where the
points had abnormally high mP due to aggregation.

Isothermal
Titration Calorimetry
Cbx proteins were
dialyzed into ITC buffer (20 mM Tris, 250 mM NaCl, pH = 8.0), and
the concentrations of proteins were measured at A280 using absorbance
spectroscopy. The dialysis buffer solution was used to dilute the
proteins and to dissolve the inhibitor 9. ITC experiments
were conducted at 298 K using MicroCal VP-ITC. The ligand solution
(40–60 mM) in syringe was titrated into the Cbx protein (16–48
μM) in a sample cell. Each titration contains 30 injections,
with the first injection measuring 2 μL and remaining injections
measuring 10 μL each. The duration between two consecutive injections
was 240 s. Control titration of heat from ligand dilution was measured
from a titration of the ligand solution into the buffer with the above-mentioned
instrument settings. Data treatment of titrations to obtain thermodynamic
parameters was performed as follows: baseline corrections were performed
for both the main titration and control titration data, control data
were subtracted from the main data, and data fitting was carried out
with a OneSites binding model using the Origin data-fitting software.
Thermodynamic parameters presented in Table 5 are the mean values from two individual
runs.
