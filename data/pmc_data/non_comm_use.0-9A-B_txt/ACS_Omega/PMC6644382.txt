The remediation of soil contaminated
by 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)
ethane (DDT) has been a challenge. In this paper, the degradation
performances of the ball milling-induced plate-like sub-microstructured
zero valent iron (SMZVI) to DDT in a real soil environment is studied.
It has been found that such SMZVI exhibits much higher degradation
performances to DDT in soil than commercial ZVI powders under acidic
conditions. More than 95% DDT could be degraded within 80 min in the
5 ppm DDT-contaminated soil with addition of 50 mg g–1 SMZVI, which is much better than the previously reported results.
The time-dependent DDT removal amount can be well described by the
pseudo first-order kinetic model. Further experiments have revealed
that the ZVI dosages, surfactant’s and acidic additions, and
the weight ratio of soil-to-water in the slurries are important to
DDT degradation, and the degradation products were mainly DDD (a product
with less chlorine). An acid-assisted ZVI-induced reductive dechlorination
process is proposed, which can well explain the DDT degradation behaviors
in soil and the influence from the other factors. This work not only
deepens the understanding of DDT degradation in soils based on ZVI
but also demonstrates that the SMZVI could be a promising material
for DDT degradation in real environments.

==== Body
1 Introduction
It
is well-known that 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane
(DDT) is a chlorinated pesticide and was widely used for agricultural
pest control and disease prevention.1 Because
of its toxic and persistent nature, however, DDT has been banned in
many countries and selected as 1 of 12 persistent organic pollutants
at the Stockholm Convention.2 Because of
its long-distance mobility, high stability, and bioaccumulation,3 a large amount of residues of DDT still exists
in air, water, soil, sediment, plants, etc4−7 Such DDT residues are very harmful
to humans and animals.8−12 It is thus of importance to use practical and efficient methods
to remove and degrade DDT, especially in soil. There have been many
methods developed for degradation of DDT in soils, such as biological
treatment,8−10 electrochemical process,11 photochemical degradation,12 high-temperature
calcinations,13 metal-catalyzed reaction,14 chemical method,15,16 etc. These
methods are often low in efficiency for DDT degradation because of
high cost and/or being time-consuming.

Zero-valent iron (ZVI)
is a powerful and effective reducing agent
for many toxic organic compounds. It is also nontoxic and relatively
inexpensive compared with the other zero-valent metallic particles.17−19 It has been reported that nanoscaled ZVI particles, because of the
high specific surface area, are more effective than microscaled ZVI
particles for the degradation of toxic and hazardous chemicals.20−23 However, the ZVI nanoparticles easily agglomerate, leading to loss
of the ability to degrade pollutants. The ZVI with a stable structure
and high specific surface area is expected.

Obviously, the microsized
particles with submicro- or nano-structure
would avoid agglomeration and possess the structural stability of
bulk and the high activity of the nanoparticles. Therefore, the ZVI
particles with such a structure could be a better candidate material
to effectively reduce the toxic organic compounds. However, the DDT
mostly exists in soil (or slurry), such as the sites of insecticide
factories, ploughlands, etc. because the solubility of DDT in real
environmental water is very small (much less than ppm level). Obviously,
the soil environment is completely different from the aqueous solution
and will involve different reaction systems after the addition of
ZVI. Could such ZVI be used for practical treatment of DDT in real
environment (soil or slurry)? How does it degrade the DDT in soil?
What are the mechanism and products of DDT degradation in the soil
environment? These issues are to be addressed.

In this work,
we fabricate the sub-microstructured ZVI (SMZVI)
powders by ball-milling the industrially reduced iron powders and
systematically study the degradation performances of the ball milling-induced
SMZVI to the DDT in a real soil environment. The SMZVI powders consist
of plate-like particles. It has been shown that the plate-like SMZVI
exhibits much higher degradation performances to the DDT in a soil
(slurry) than the commercial ZVI powders (CZVI) under acid assistance.
More than 95% DDT could be degraded within 80 min for the 5 ppm DDT-contaminated
soil with the addition of 50 mg g–1 SMZVI, which
is better than the previously reported results. This study has demonstrated
that the plate-like SMZVI possesses good application potential in
practical treatment of the DDT-contaminated soil environment. The
details are reported in this article.

2 Results
and Discussion
By ball-milling the industrially reduced iron
powders, the SMZVI
powders could be obtained in mass scale. Field emission scanning electron
microscopy (FESEM) observation has shown that the as-prepared products
consist of flake-like objects that are 2–5 μm in planar
dimension and 100–200 nm in thickness, as typically demonstrated
in Figure 1a. Correspondingly,
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement has confirmed that the as-prepared
products are pure iron of bcc structure, as shown in Figure S1. In addition, the specific surface area was estimated
to be about 16 m2/g from the isothermal N2 sorption
measurement shown in Figure S2. By contrast,
the commercial iron CZVI powders are composed of particles with irregular
shape and are about 100–150 μm in size, as shown in Figure 1b.

Figure 1 FESEM images of the as-ball-milled
products (a) and purchased CZVI
(b).

Ball milling is a simple and conventional
method to fabricate nanomaterials
and has been widely used. The formation of the iron nanoplates in
this work is easily understood, due to mechanical force of the steel
balls and plasticity of metal iron, and is not discussed here. We
just focus on the degradation performances of these plate-like SMZVI
to the DDT in soil.

2.1 Degradation Measurements
2.1.1 DDT Degradation by ZVI
After addition
of the as-prepared SMZVI powders to the DDT-contained slurry under
an acid assistance (see the Experimental section in details), the reaction between the SMZVI and DDT would take place
and hence induce DDT degradation under anaerobic conditions. Figure 2 shows the DDT content
in the contaminated soil (slurry), with the soil-to-water weight ratio
(Rs/w) of 1/10 and initial DDT concentration
of 5 ppm, as a function of the reaction time after addition of ZVI
(50 mg g–1) at room temperature.

soil as a function of the reaction
time after the addition of ZVI (50 mg g–1) at room
temperature. (a) addition of SMZVI, (b) addition of CZVI, and (c)
without addition.

The DDT content in the
soil was decreased by about 85% in 60 min
and above 95% in 100 min for the addition of SMZVI [curve (a) in Figure 2]. This is much faster
than that after the addition of the CZVI, in which the DDT content
was decreased only by 57% in 100 min [curve (b) in Figure 2], and the previously reported
results, which showed that it took mostly about 20 to 40 days to remove
DDT in the soil by ZVI.19,24 As for the case without
the addition of ZVI in the slurry, there was no change in the DDT
content in the slurry [curve (c) in Figure 2].

Furthermore, the pH value in the
slurry was measured during the
reaction. The pH value was significantly different before and after
HCl addition in each 20 min interval, as shown in Figure 3. At the stages immediately
after each acid addition, the pH value was about 2.0 and was almost
unchanged for the slurry with SMZVI [see the data points of solid
circles in Figure 3a] but increases to around 6 in 20 min immediately before next acid
additions in our experimental conditions [see the data points of solid
squares in Figure 3a]. For the slurry with CZVI, however, the pH values immediately
before and after each acid addition in 20 min interval decreased gradually
with the reaction time within 100 min. Both tend to be pH ≈
2 after reaction for 100 min, and the reaction-induced pH increment
was only 1 or less, as shown in Figure 3b.

Figure 3 pH values of the slurry versus reaction time before and
after adding
acid in each 20 min interval for SMZVI (a) and CZVI (b). Points (I)
the pH values immediately before each acid-addition; points (II) the
pH values immediately after each acid-addition.

Moreover, the reaction products in the slurry were identified
during
DDT degradation. The slurry with SMZVI, after reaction for different
durations, was qualitatively analyzed by a gas chromatography–mass
spectrometer (GC–MS), as shown in Figure 4. It has been demonstrated that the reaction
products mainly consist of DDD (a product with less chlorine), in
addition to the undegraded DDT, as illustrated in Figure 4a. The DDT peak gradually decreased
with the reaction time and almost disappeared after 60 min. The DDD
peak increased with the increasing reaction time but gradually decreased
after 60 min because of the dechlorination of DDD. By close examination
of the results in Figure 4a, it has been found that after reaction for 60 min, in addition
to the dominant DDD, there also existed trace reaction products DDMS
and DDNS (less chlorines than DDD) which shows at retention times
6.2 and 7.6 min, respectively, as typically illustrated in Figure S3, corresponding to the enlarged GS–MS
spectrum for the slurry with SMZVI after reaction for 100 min. Figure 4b quantitatively
presents the product DDD content as a function of the reaction time.
The DDD content increased to 3.9 ppm after reaction for 60 min and
then decreased to 3.3 ppm when the reaction was for 100 min. For the
slurry with CZVI, the DDD content increased slowly with the reaction
time and reached only 1.2 ppm after the reaction for 60 min and 1.4
ppm for 100 min, which is much lower than that in the slurry with
SMZVI.

Figure 4 GC–MS analyses of the reaction products. (a) Qualitative
analysis for the slurry with SMZVI after reaction for different durations.
(b) Contents of product DDD versus reaction time for the slurries
with SMZVI and CZVI, respectively.

In addition, comparing the results shown in Figures 2 and 4b, we can see
that there exists the difference between the increment of the product
DDD content in Figure 4b and the decrement of the DDT content shown in Figure 2. The former is slightly smaller
than the latter. Typically, when the reaction is for 60 min, the total
DDD’s amount is about 3.9 ppm, but the decrement of the DDT
content is about 4.24 ppm for the slurry with SMZVI. This difference
should be attributed to the dechlorination from DDT to DDD, which
leads to the decrease of the molecular weight.

2.1.2 Kinetics of DDT Degradation
Further,
it has been found that the time-dependent DDT removal amount, shown
in Figure 2, could
be described by the pseudo first-order kinetic model25,26 or 1  where C0 is the
initial DDT content (in mg L–1), C the DDT content after reaction for t min, and k the first-order rate constant (min–1) which is also called the observed rate constant of the pseudo first-order
reaction. Figure 5 presents
the plots of ln(C/C0)
versus the reaction time for the DDT-contained slurries added with
ZVI (the data are from in Figure 2) and indicates the good linear relations between ln(C/C0) and the reaction time t within 100 min. The rate constant k values
are 0.033 and 0.009 min–1 corresponding to additions
of SMZVI and CZVI, respectively. The rate constant for the slurry
with SMZVI is more than 3.5 times as high as that for the slurry with
CZVI.

versus the reaction time, for the DDT-contained slurries with (I)
SMZVI and (II) CZVI (data from Figure 2).

2.2 Influencing
Factors
Further experiments
have shown that there are some factors influencing DDT degradation
in the soil, such as ZVI’s dosage, acidic addition amount,
surfactant addition, and the soil–water ratio (Rs/w) in the DDT-contained soils.

2.2.1 ZVI
Dosage
The SMZVI dosage in
the DDT-contained soil has an important effect on the DDT degradation. Figure 6a demonstrates such
results. The DDT removal amount increases with the increasing SMZVI
dosage after a given reaction time. When the SMZVI dosage is 10 mg
g–1, only 36% DDT could be removed or degraded within
100 min, whereas the addition of 50 mg g–1 could
lead to degradation of more than 95% DDT within the same period, as
shown in Figure 6a.
The fitting results by eq 1 are shown in Figure S4, and the corresponding
parameter values are listed in Table 1. The rate constant k increases with
the increase of the SMZVI dosage.

addition on DDT degradation
under the initial content of DDT in the soil: 5 ppm; the Rs/w: 1/10. (a) Effects of the SMZVI dosages (addition
of 1 M HCl: 200 μL every 20 min). (b) Effects of acidic addition
for the addition amount of 1 M HCl every 20 min: 0, 50, 100, and 200
μL (the surfactant content in the slurries: 3%).

2.2.2 Acidic Addition
It has been found
that acidic addition during the reaction is crucial to DDT degradation
by SMZVI in slurries. Without acidic addition, the SMZVI could hardly
degrade DDT as shown in Figure 6b. A small amount of acidic addition during the reaction would
lead to a significant degradation of DDT in the slurry, and more acidic
addition induced faster DDT degradation. The time-dependent degradations
could also be described by eq 1, and the fitting rate constant k values
are listed in Table 1. The rate constant k increased with the increasing
acidic addition. When the addition of 1 M HCl was up to 200 μL/20
min in our experimental conditions, the DDT degradation could be over
95% within 100 min. However, more acidic addition could not further
increase the degradation rate because of the complete dissolution
of the added SMZVI.

2.2.3 Surfactant Addition
Furthermore,
the surfactant is another important factor during DDT degradation. Figure 7a shows the degradation
results for the 5 ppm DDT-contaminated slurries with Triton TX-100
up to 3% treated by SMZVI. The DDT degradation degree was obviously
increased with the increasing content of triton TX-100. If there was
no surfactant in the slurry, only 53% DDT was degraded within 100
min, whereas over 95% DDT could be removed with 1% or more triton
TX-100 in the slurry [Figure 7a]. The corresponding rate constants k could
also be obtained by fitting according to eq 1, as listed in Table 1. For the addition of 1% surfactant, the
value of the rate constant was 4 times as high as that without surfactant
addition. However, more surfactant only leads to insignificant improvement
of DDT degradation.

Figure 7 Influence of the surfactant addition and the Rs/w in the slurry on the DDT degradation induced by SMZVI
(under the initial DDT content in the soil: 5 ppm; the addition amount
of SMZVI: 50 mg g–1; addition of 1 M HCl: 200 μL/20
min). (a) Effects of the surfactant addition (the Rs/w: 1/10). (b) Effects of the Rs/w in the slurry (the surfactant content: 3%).

2.2.4 Weight Ratio of Soil-to-Water
in the Slurry
(Rs/w)
In addition, the DDT degradation
in the slurry could also be influenced by Rs/w. The DDT degradation rate was lower, for Rs/w of 1:5, than that for 1:10, as shown in Figure 7b. However, when the water
amount was increased to Rs/w = 1:20, the
DDT degradation efficiency decreased slightly. The corresponding values
of the rate constant k are shown in Table 1. The k value
for Rs/w of 1:10 was greater than those
of 1:5 and 1:20.

2.3 Acid-Assisted SMZVI-Induced
Dechlorination
Mechanism
Now, let us briefly discuss the SMZVI-induced DDT
degradation. Commonly, the DDT degradation in the aqueous solutions
proceeds via one of two main routes, depending on the prevailing environmental
conditions.27 For instance, under aerobic
conditions, the degradation of DDT to DDE (another product with less
chlorine than DDD) could be the main process,16,28 while transformation of DDT to DDD by reductive dechlorination would
be the dominant reaction under anaerobic conditions.29 On the basis of the above results, the degradation behaviors
of DDT in the slurries in this study could be attributed to the acid-assisted
ZVI-induced reductive dechlorination of DDT, as schematically shown
in Figure 8.

Figure 8 Schematic illustration
for SMZVI-induced dechlorination of DDT
to DDD. (a) Desorption of DDT in soil into the aqueous solution in
the slurry. (b) Adsorption of DDT on the SMZVI surface and production
of Fe2+ ions and hydrogen atoms by redox. (c) H-atom and
Fe2+-induced reductive dechlorination of DDT to DDD. The
down-left frame: the symbols of the ions, molecules, soil particle
and SMZVI in the slurry.

The DDT in soil could desorb into the aqueous solution in
the slurry
because of the existence of surfactant TX-100, as illustrated in frame
(a) of Figure 8. When
the SMZVI was added into the DDT-contained slurry, the desorbed DDT
in the aqueous solution of the slurry would adsorb on the SMZVI surface.
Meanwhile, the Fe0 atoms on the SMZVI would dissolve continuously
with the release of electrons because of the low pH value (or the
acidic condition) and the H+ ions would be reduced into
hydrogen atoms, as previously reported,17 or as demonstrated in frame (b) of Figure 8. The corresponding reaction is described
by 2  

In this case, the dechlorination reaction of DDT could thus take
place. The reduced hydrogen atoms could react with the DDT adsorbed
on the SMZVI and induce dechlorination of DDT to DDD by a substitution
reaction or 3  Moreover, the ferrous ions Fe2+ can serve as a secondary reductant,17 which could also lead to the dechlorination of DDT to DDD. It means
that the reaction could take place, as illustrated in frame (c) of Figure 8. 4  

Briefly, the Fe0 on the SMZVI reacted with the H+ and produced the hydrogen
atoms on the surface of SMZVI and
Fe2+ ions in the aqueous solution of the slurry. The DDT
adsorbed on the surface of SMZVI reacted with the H0 atoms
and/or the ferrous ions Fe2+ ions, which induced the reductive
dechlorination of DDT to DDD and the decrease of the DDT content in
the soil with the reaction time (see Figure 2).

Furthermore, according to reactions 3, 4, the formed DDD could also
react with the hydrogen
atoms and/or Fe2+ ions and transform into the products
with less chlorines, such as DDMS by the reductive dechlorination,30 and similarly, the DDMS would further be dechlorinated
to DDNS.23 Therefore, after reaction for
enough time, the DDD content would decrease with the reaction time,
as illustrated in Figure 4b.

The SMZVI has much more active sites on its surface
than the CZVI
because of the higher specific surface area. The active sites have
two functions during the reaction under the low pH condition. First,
they could adsorb the DDT molecules, and second, they could react
with H+ to produce hydrogen atoms and Fe2+ ions,
as previously reported.17 Such functions
could induce reactions (2–4) and hence the dechlorination of
the DDT. Therefore, DDT removal for the SMZVI is much faster than
that for the CZVI, as shown in Figure 2.

As for the factors influencing the DDT degradation,
obviously,
the processes of the dechlorination would increase the pH values in
the slurry because reactions 2–4 would lead to consumption
of H+. In the case of SMZVI addition, because of its higher
specific surface area, the added acid would be consumed completely
within 20 min and result in the termination of the dechlorination
reaction before next run of acidic addition, increasing the pH value
of the slurry from about 2.0 to around 6.0 [Figure 3a]. For CZVI addition, however, because of
the lower specific surface area and slower dechlorination reaction,
the added acid could not be consumed completely within 20 min, and
hence, the pH values immediately before and after each acid addition
in 20 min interval decrease gradually with the reaction time [Figure 3b].

Also, acid
addition will promote reactions 2–4 and hence
accelerate the dechlorination process or DDT removal [Figure 6b]. As for the addition amount
of SMZVI, more SMZVI corresponds to more active sites and negative
redox potential,31 resulting in faster
degradation of DDT. Moreover, because the surfactant could induce
desorption of the hydrophobic contaminant DDT from the soil and increase
the adsorption of the DDT on the reactive SMZVI surface,32 the surfactant addition can promote DDT degradation,
as shown in Figure 7a. For the weight ratio Rs/w of soil-to-water,
the too high Rs/w was not beneficial to
the DDT desorption from the soil, and the too low Rs/w would induce too diluted DDT in the aqueous solution
of the slurry. Both of them would decrease the access of DDT to the
ZVI and hence the degradation rate of DDT, as shown in Figure 7b.

3 Conclusion
and Remarks
In summary, the plate-like SMZVI, fabricated
by ball-milling the
industrially reduced iron powders, has been used for the degradation
of DDT in the soil which is in the form of slurries under acidic conditions.
Such plate-like SMZVI has shown much higher and faster DDT degradation
than CZVI because of the higher specific surface area. More than 95%
DDT could be degraded within 80 min in the 5 ppm DDT-contaminated
soil with addition of 50 mg g–1 SMZVI, which is
much better than the previously reported results. It has been demonstrated
that the degradation of DDT is attributed to the acid-assisted SMZVI-induced
reductive dechlorination of DDT to DDD, that is, the DDT, adsorbed
on the surface of SMZVI, reacts with the hydrogen atoms and/or the
ferrous ions Fe2+ produced in the acidic slurries, leading
to the reductive dechlorination to DDD and the decrease of the DDT
content with the reaction time, which is subject to the pseudo first-order
kinetic model. Furthermore, it has been revealed that enough ZVI dosage
and surfactant addition and the appropriate weight ratio of soil-to-water
in the slurries are important to the DDT degradation under acidic
conditions. These results could deepen the understanding of the DDT
degradation in soils based on ZVI. This study has also indicated that
the plate-like SMZVI could be a promising material for the DDT degradation
in the real soil environments.

Finally, it should be mentioned
that according to reactions 3, 4,
the produced DDD could also react with the hydrogen atoms and/or Fe2+ ions and transform into new products with less chlorines.
However, the added SMZVI has been consumed completely after reaction
for about 100 min. If more SMZVI is subsequently added into the slurries
and the reaction period is extended, we could achieve dechlorination
or degradation of DDD, which needs further work.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
Commercial iron powders
(CZVI, size < 100 mesh, Fe: 98%) and surfactant TX-100 were purchased
from Beijing Chemical Factory, China. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) and
anhydrous sodium sulphate (Na2SO4), of analytical
grade, were purchased from Aladdin Company, USA. Hexane and dichloromethane
(HPLC-graded) were offered by Tedia Company, USA. The p,p′-DDT was purchased from Aldrich Chemical
Company, USA, and no other substance exists in it. Calibration standards
of DDTs, including p,p′-DDD
(2,2-bis(chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethane) and p,p′-DDT, were obtained from AccuStandard, Inc., USA.
All solutions were prepared in deionized water (18.2 MΩ).

4.2 Preparations of SMZVI
The SMZVI was
prepared by ball-milling the industrially reduced iron powders. Briefly,
the industrially oxidized scales was reduced into the iron powders
in H2, and then the powers were through the 320 mesh sieve
and ball-milled for about 120 h by the steel balls (ϕ 5–10
mm) in a ball mill under 7.5 kW power at room temperature. The final
products (or SMZVI) were obtained by cleaning the ball-milled iron
powders with ethanol and drying at 60 °C in vacuum oven. The
products were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscope
(Sirion 200) and XRD. The N2 sorption was measured on OMNISORP
100 CX, Coulter.

4.3 Degradation Experiment
4.4 Preparation of DDT-Contaminated Soil
DDT-contaminated
soil samples were prepared, as previously described.33 Briefly, the soil with no exposure to pesticides
was first collected from the area in the 25–30 cm below the
surface at our campus (Institute of solid state physics, Chinese Academy
of Sciences, Hefei, China). In such depth below surface, the extraneous
materials like twigs, leaves, etc. on the ground were avoided. The
collected soil consists of organic carbon (2%), sand (57%), silt (26%),
and clay (15%). Then, the soil was air-dried in shade and gently ground
by a pestle. To remove the large soil particles and impurity materials
(such as leaves, roots, and so on), the ground soil passing through
a 1 mm-sieve was used for loading DDT, as previously reported.33 Then, 100 mg of market-grade DDT powders was
dissolved in 100 mL of hexane in a volumetric flask to form a hexane
solution with 1000 ppm DDT, which was subsequently diluted to the
hexane solution with 2.5 ppm DDT. The 50 g soil was added into a conical
flask, followed by adding 100 mL of 2.5 ppm DDT hexane solution and
stirring in a magnetic stirring apparatus for 3 h. The mixed slurry
was thus formed and put in the watch-glass and dried in airing chamber
for 1 day. The 5 ppm DDT-contaminated soil samples were finally obtained
and put in a closed glass bottle.

4.5 Extraction
of DDT from the Contaminated Soil
Typically, 1 g of DDT-contaminated
soil was transferred into a
50 mL glass centrifuge tube and mixed with 20 mL of mixture of acetone
and hexane (1:1; v/v). The mixture was then shaken in a shaker for
1 h (300 rpm), forming a slurry sample. The DDT in the slurry sample
was extracted by ultrasonic vibration for 30 min in an ultrasonic
bath, followed by centrifuging at 5000 rpm for 10 min to separate
the supernatant from the soil. The supernatant was transferred to
a 1.5 mL glass bottle for gas chromatography and evaporated in the
airing chamber to remove the polar solvent. After the supernatant
was completely evaporated, DDT was left in the bottle, and the hexane
was added into the bottle before analysis was conducted on the GC–MS
(Thermo Fisher TSQ Quantum XLS) with a low limit of quantitation (LOQ
) and limit of detection (LOD) (in the range of 0.05–0.5 ppb).
Calibration standards of DDTs (obtained from AccuStandard, Inc. US)
were diluted to 50, 100, 250, and 500 ppb by hexane. These standard
samples were measured by the GC–MS to obtain the standard plot
for DDT by linear-fitting using the GC–MS software, as shown
in Figure S5. The correlation coefficient
for linear fitting was above 0.99. The extraction rate of DDT by such
extraction under our conditions was thus determined by GC–MS,
which was in the range from 0.98 to 1.02 with the average value about
0.99 by several repeated experiments.

4.6 Degradation
Test
The degradation
tests were carried out in a 25 mL glass centrifuge tube with a Teflon
lid. DDT-contaminated soil sample (1 g, 5 ppm) and 10 mL of deionized
water with 3% surfactant (Triton X-100 or TX-100), which were purged
by N2 for half hour to remove oxygen in them, were put
into the tube to form the aqueous slurry with the soil–water
ratio (Rs/w) of 1/10 (g/mL). ZVI (50 mg)
was then added to the aqueous slurry, kept tightly closed, and eddied
for 2 min. The series of such aqueous slurries with ZVI were prepared
as parallel samples. To each parallel sample, 200 μL of 1 M
HCl was added dropwise and shaken in the shaking table at 300 rpm.
After reaction for 20 min, one of them was taken out, and then, 200
μL of 1 M HCl was separately added to the rest of the parallel
samples. Such procedures (sampling and addition of acid into the reaction
mixture) were repeated every 20 min. The pH value of the reaction
solution was measured by a pH meter (Mettler Toledo pH meter (FG2/EL2).

The sampled reaction mixtures were centrifuged by 5000 rpm. The
supernatant (5 mL), as well as 5 mL of hexane, was transferred into
a clean glass centrifuge tube and eddied for 3 min to extract the
residual DDT and its degradation products. After stratification, the
supernatant of hexane was transferred into the 1.5 mL glass bottle
and analyzed in GC–MS. The remained soil was freeze-dried for
2 days before the residual DDT and degradation products were extracted
from it according to the procedures described in subsection Extraction of DDT from the contaminated soil.
The DDT content in the slurry was thus calculated. The contents of
various residual substances are the sum of those in the supernatant
and the remained soil.
