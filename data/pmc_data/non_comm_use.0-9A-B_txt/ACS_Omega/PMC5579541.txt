Methylmercury (MeHg) is a pervasive
and ubiquitous environmental
neurotoxicant within aquatic ecosystems, known to alter behavior in
fish and other vertebrates. This study sought to assess the behavioral
effects of developmental MeHg exposure on larval yellow perch (Perca flavescens)—a nonmodel fish species
native to the Great Lakes. Embryos were exposed to MeHg (0, 30, 100,
300, and 1000 nM) for 20 h and then reared to 25 days post fertilization
(dpf) for analyses of spontaneous swimming, visual motor response
(VMR), and foraging efficiency. MeHg exposures rendered total mercury
(THg) body burdens of 0.02, 0.21, 0.95, 3.14, and 14.93 μg/g
(wet weight). Organisms exposed to 1000 nM exhibited high mortality;
thus, they were excluded from downstream behavioral analyses. All
MeHg exposures tested were associated with a reduction in spontaneous
swimming at 17 and 25 dpf. Exposure to 30 and 100 nM MeHg caused altered
locomotor output during the VMR assay at 21 dpf, whereas exposure
to 100 nM MeHg was associated with decreased foraging efficiency at
25 dpf. For the sake of comparison, the second-lowest exposure tested
here rendered a THg burden that represents the permissible level of
consumable fish in the United States. Moreover, this dose is reported
in roughly two-thirds of consumable fish species monitored in the
United States, according to the Food and Drug Administration. Although
the THg body burdens reported here were higher than expected in the
environment, our study is the first to analyze the effects of MeHg
exposure on fundamental survival behaviors of yellow perch larvae
and advances in the exploration of the ecological relevance of behavioral
end points.

Introduction
Mercury (Hg) is a widespread
and pervasive neurotoxicant that has
been found to affect the behavior of all vertebrates studied to date,
including fish.1 Hg contamination affects
numerous aquatic ecosystems worldwide;2 among these, the Great Lakes Basin has been afflicted by widespread
Hg contamination that has adversely affected the aquatic resources
of the region.3 Naturally occurring processes,
such as volcanic eruption, can release inorganic mercury into the
atmosphere, but it was the onset of the industrial revolution that
introduced new sources of anthropogenic Hg emissions, such as fuel
combustion, waste incinerators, mining, and manufacturing. Among all
of the sources of Hg, the most numerous and largest emitters are coal-fired
power plants.3 This contaminant enters
the aquatic ecosystems primarily through atmospheric deposition,4 after which microorganisms convert the elemental
Hg into organic Hg.5 Methylmercury (MeHg)
is reported to be the most abundant organic form of Hg and accounts
for nearly all (95–99%) of the total Hg fraction in fish tissues.6 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) monitors
nationwide THg levels in fish and establishes MeHg concentration thresholds
for human consumption; however, relatively little effort is made to
investigate the exposure thresholds at which piscivorous fish and
their offspring are adversely affected. The Wisconsin Department of
Natural Resources (WIDNR) has been monitoring Hg in freshwater fish
since the early 1970s. Despite a reported slow reduction in the tissue
burden of MeHg in fish, the prevalence of fish (e.g., yellow perch
[Perca flavescens]) consumption advisories
in almost every body of water in the Great Lakes region remains an
ecological and public health concern.7

Concentrations of Hg in the yellow perch within the Great Lakes
Basin vary substantially, with the highest concentrations reported
in fish from inland lakes.8,9 It has been estimated
that yellow perch begin experiencing adverse health effects at a tissue
concentration threshold of 0.2 μg/g total mercury (THg; wet
weight measured in whole-body samples).7,10 A recent report
by Wiener and collaborators7 consolidates
THg concentration data from different yellow perch tissues obtained
from 691 bodies of water scattered throughout the Great Lakes region.
Average whole-body THg concentrations in yellow perch from 45 (6.5%)
of these 691 waters equaled or exceeded the aforementioned 0.2 μg/g
wet weight threshold. However, if the maximum whole-body THg concentrations
from all of the surveyed sites are considered, 151 (22%) of the sites
presented cases that equaled or exceeded 0.2 μg/g, some reaching
up to 2.60 μg/g in muscle tissue.

Yellow perch play an
important role in the near-shore ecology of
Lake Michigan11 and are popular among recreational
fishermen. However, the commercial fishery for yellow perch in Wisconsin
waters of Lake Michigan has been closed since 1996 due to a decline
in population. Since then, the populations of this important natural
resource in Lake Michigan have continued to decrease considerably.
Wilber and collaborators11 estimated a
decline of 92% of the stock of adult yellow perch in the state of
Wisconsin, a species that before 1997 represented 85% of the recreational
catch by number.

The decline of the yellow perch has been attributed
mostly to overfishing12 and the introduction
of invasive species.13 However, recent
research suggests that developmental
MeHg exposure can alter the behavior of embryonic fathead minnow14,15 (Pimephales promelas) and larval
zebrafish1 (Danio rerio), two model fish species. Ultimately, subtle alterations in behavior
may adversely impact fish survival through a process termed “ecological
death”,16 whereby critical survival
behaviors of fish (e.g., foraging, predator avoidance, and reproduction)
become impaired. In turn, these impairments could also affect population
dynamics in the long term, as has been predicted by individual-based
adverse outcome pathway models of MeHg exposure in Atlantic croaker.17

Knowledge of how subtle behavioral changes
driven by developmental
MeHg exposure may affect the survival of yellow perch, a nonmodel
fish species, is severely lacking. An improved understanding of this
interaction is required for fisheries and policy makers to consider
the broader implications of MeHg exposure on fish within the Great
Lakes Basin and beyond. The objective of the current study was to
elucidate the effects of MeHg exposure on the behavior (i.e., visual
motor response (VMR), spontaneous swimming, and foraging efficiency)
of yellow perch larvae. Visual motor response, spontaneous swimming,
and foraging efficiency assays were chosen to evaluate the possible
behavioral effects of developmental exposure of yellow perch to MeHg
based on our previous zebrafish study.1 These assays analyze the locomotor responses of organisms to light,
evaluate swimming behavior (e.g., total distance traveled and average
speed), and quantify prey items captured per unit of time (i.e., foraging
efficiency). The aforementioned are standard end points for behavioral
screening, although foraging efficiency is seldom studied. Larvae
were chosen for this study due to the higher sensitivity of developing
organisms to environmental insults, such as MeHg exposure.18 Food limitation is suspected to be one of the
main causes of larval fish mortality in nature;19 thus, a focus of the current study was to investigate a
potential link between developmental MeHg exposure, locomotor output,
and foraging efficiency. MeHg-induced behavioral alteration may impact
the ability of larvae to successfully forage for prey. Moreover, altered
visual motor response and/or locomotion could make larvae more susceptible
to predation.17 Establishing the links
between these end points and toxicant exposure is critical in the
development and implementation of bioassays intended to estimate ecological
risk (Figure 1).

Figure 1 MeHg exposures and behavioral
analysis timeline. Fertilized egg
masses were collected from 15 sexually mature yellow perch spawning
pairs. Three biological replicates consisted of the newly fertilized
eggs from five egg masses. At ∼12 hpf (128 cell stage), the
embryos were exposed to five nominal concentrations of MeHg (0, 30,
100, 300, and 1000 nM). At 14 dpf, THg analysis was performed and
posthatch survival was assessed. At 17 dpf, the locomotor activity
of larvae was assessed in continuous light and continuous darkness.
At 21 dpf, the larvae were subjected to the VMR assay. Finally, at
25 dpf, the locomotor activity of the larvae was once again assessed
(only in continuous light), followed by an assessment of foraging
efficiency.

Results
Embryo Posthatch
Survival and Dosimetry
The whole-body
THg burdens in embryos from the different MeHg exposures (0, 30, 100,
300, and 1000 nM) ranged from 0.01 to 14.93 μg/g and were all
statistically different from each other (n = 3 pools
of ten 17 dpf larvae, F(3,7) = 55.717, P < 0.001; Table 1). MeHg exposure at 1000 nM caused a significant decrease
in posthatch survival (n = 15 culture dishes, F(4,70) = 16.996, P < 0.001; Table 1); thus, this cohort
was excluded from downstream behavioral analyses, as stated in Materials and Methods. No deformities were identified
in any of the surviving embryos.

Analysis of Swimming Behavior
in 17 dpf Larval Yellow Perch
In the light, all MeHg-exposed
larvae exhibited lower locomotor
activity relative to control (n = 90 larvae, F(3,156) = 46.162, P < 0.001; Figure 2). However, no statistical
differences were observed between exposure groups recorded in the
dark (P > 0.05). Within each individual exposure
group, larvae exhibited higher locomotor activity in the light relative
to the dark (n = 90 larvae, P <
0.001; Figure 2).

Figure 2 Locomotor
activity of 17 dpf yellow perch exposed to graded concentrations
of MeHg and tested in two different lighting conditions. Yellow perch
of all exposure groups tested in the light exhibited a higher locomotor
activity compared to the groups tested in the dark (n = 15 plates, P < 0.001). Overall, all MeHg-exposed
larvae exhibited lower locomotor activity in the light (n = 15 plates, ***P < 0.001). However, no statistical
differences were observed between exposure groups recorded in the
dark (n = 15 plates, P = 0.163).
Values are expressed as mean ± SE.

Analysis of the Visual Motor Response in 21 dpf Larval Yellow
Perch
During the last light period of the VMR assay, the
30 nM MeHg-exposed larvae exhibited greater locomotor activity than
the 100 nM MeHg exposure groups (n = 36 larvae, F(3,140) = 5.081, P < 0.001; Figure 3A). Comparison of
all other exposure groups within the other light and dark periods
yielded no significant difference (n = 36 larvae, P > 0.05, Figure 3A). Moreover, when comparing the locomotor output of the larvae
throughout the 50 min duration of the whole experiment, the locomotor
activity of larvae exposed to 30 nM MeHg was higher than that of the
controls (n = 36 larvae, F(3,140) = 7.525, P < 0.001; Figure 3B). In contrast, larvae exposed to 100 nM
MeHg exhibited reduced locomotor activity relative to control (n = 36 larvae, P < 0.001; Figure 3B). There was no statistical
difference between the 300 nM MeHg exposure group and the control
(n = 36 larvae, P > 0.05; Figure 3B).

dpf yellow perch during the VMR assay. (A)
During the last light period of the VMR assay, larvae exposed to 30
nM MeHg swam significantly more often than those exposed to 100 nM
MeHg (n = 36 larvae, ***P < 0.001).
(B) Throughout the duration of the entire 50 min assay, the locomotor
activity of larvae exposed to 30 nM MeHg was higher than that of control
(n = 36 larvae, P < 0.001), and
larvae exposed to 100 nM MeHg swam significantly less often than control
(n = 36 larvae, P < 0.001). There
was no difference between the 300 nM MeHg-exposed and control groups
(n = 36 larvae, P = 0.959). Values
are expressed as mean ± SE.

Spontaneous Swimming and Foraging Efficiency at 25 dpf
As
observed at 17 dpf, the larvae from all MeHg exposure groups continued
to exhibit decreased locomotor activity (i.e., total distance traveled
in 30 s and % of time active [% activity]) at 25 dpf compared to control.
The greatest decrease in locomotor activity (relative to the control)
was observed in the 100 nM MeHg exposure group (n = 120 larvae, F(3,476) = 5.146, P < 0.05; Table 2). No effects were observed in the linearity of the trajectories
(NGDR) during the 30 s analysis periods (n = 120
larvae, P > 0.05; Table 2). Similar to the locomotor activity results,
the foraging efficiency was reduced in all MeHg exposure groups, compared to control, but statistical significance
was observed only in the 100 nM MeHg exposure group (n = 4 groups of larvae, F(3,12) = 4.095, P < 0.05, Table 2).

Discussion
Our
study elucidated the effects of embryonic MeHg exposure on
the posthatch survival, spontaneous swimming, VMR, and foraging efficiency
of larval yellow perch. The MeHg exposures analyzed herein ranged
from an exposure concentration that rendered a THg body burden of
0.21 μg/g (wet weight; 30 nM MeHg [lowest exposure concentration])
to an exposure that resulted in a THg burden of 14.93 μg/g (wet
weight; 1000 nM MeHg [highest exposure concentration]), which caused
a dramatic decrease in posthatch survival. All MeHg exposures tested
in this study were associated with a reduction in spontaneous swimming
at 17 and 25 dpf; two exposures (30 and 100 nM) altered locomotor
output during the VMR assay at 21 dpf. The 100 nM MeHg exposure was
also associated with decreased foraging efficiency at 25 dpf. Interestingly,
the second-lowest MeHg concentration tested (30 nM; yielded neurobehavioral
effects on perch) in our study rendered THg burdens (0.95 ± 0.12
μg/g [mean ± SEM]) that represent the FDA-established threshold
for MeHg concentration in seafood intended for human consumption (1 μg/g; https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tf.asp?id=113&tid=24).
Moreover, this tissue burden is found in roughly two-thirds of commercial
fish species monitored by the FDA (https://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/Metals/ucm115644.htm).

The lowest exposure of MeHg (30 nM) included in our experimental
paradigm resulted in an embryo body burden that corresponds to the
estimated threshold of 0.2 μg/g MeHg, at which adult yellow
perch begin to exhibit adverse effects in behavior.7 Moreover, in a study by Hammerschmidt and collaborators,20 the highest reported MeHg burden in wild caught
yellow perch embryos from an inland lake in Wisconsin was found to
be 819 ng/g dry weight (approximately 0.12 μg/g wet weight),
which is roughly half of what was observed in the lowest MeHg exposure
in this study. This highlights the fact that the observed concentrations
of THg in the tissue of yellow perch in this study were relatively
high. However, body burdens of THg that exceed environmental relevance
provide pertinent preliminary evidence toward elucidation of the dose-dependent
effects of MeHg exposure on larval yellow perch. Our study is the
first to expose yellow perch embryos to MeHg under laboratory controlled
conditions and measure THg burdens in tissues of larvae as a function
of MeHg exposure concentrations, thus establishing precedence for
further studies. Notably, since we observed effects in the lowest
MeHg exposure group, it is likely that effects could be observed at
lower concentrations. Additional experiments with lower MeHg exposure
concentrations are required to confirm this possibility.

To
date, the majority of studies concerned with the study of behavior
in fish have been conducted using well-established model fish species,
such as the zebrafish (Danio rerio),
Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes),
goldfish (Carassius auratus), and fathead
minnows (Pimephales promelas).1,14,15,21−23 Here, we made use of the established methods of behavioral
analysis developed in the aforementioned model organisms to assess
behavior in yellow perch—a nonmodel organism. The behavioral
end points investigated here were selected to span different levels
of complexity, from fundamental behaviors (i.e., spontaneous swimming)
to complex responses to visual stimuli (i.e., VMR) and predator–prey
interactions (i.e., foraging efficiency). Spontaneous locomotor activity
is by far the most prominently documented behavioral end point that
can be plausibly linked to more complex behaviors, such as foraging;24 thus, our study sought to establish the relationship
between these end points in MeHg-exposed yellow perch larvae. Moreover,
the VMR assay was employed as an integral diagnostic tool to assess
the reactivity of the larvae to abrupt visual cues, which engages
both visual perception and a locomotor output as a reaction. This
assay has been used in laboratory fish as a screening tool for neuroactive
compounds,25 and it has been adopted by
the United States Environmental Protection Agency to screen for neurotoxicants26 due to its robustness and reliability. In the
present study, the ecological value of the aforementioned end points
was explored.

The first set of behavioral experiments performed
using 17 dpf
yellow perch aimed to identify MeHg-mediated effects on baseline swimming
behavior. These experiments revealed a decrease in locomotor activity
in all MeHg-exposed yellow perch tested in constant light. These results
contrasted with those observed in 7 dpf zebrafish, whereby all MeHg
exposures resulted in increased locomotor activity.1 These observations underline the importance of conducting
comparative assays between model and nonmodel organisms, as identical
assays and similar MeHg exposures resulted in opposite behavioral
responses in the two fish species.

To account for the possible
effects of illumination on the activity
of yellow perch, a spontaneous swimming experiment was conducted in
the presence and absence of light. Our results revealed not only that
yellow perch are significantly more active in the presence of light
than in the dark, but also that behavioral effects of MeHg were only
noticeable in a well-lit observation chamber, when the fish were more
active. The overall lower locomotion of yellow perch in a dark environment
appeared to mask any of the behavioral effects of MeHg that are otherwise
observed in the presence of light.

When analyzing the VMR, yellow
perch exhibited higher locomotor
activity in the light than in the dark, which contrasts with what
has been described previously in zebrafish.27 This response is presumably due to the strong phototactic behavior
of yellow perch early in development. Phototaxis was observed regularly
in our experimental organisms; the larvae would consistently congregate
toward the light of a flashlight used during the daily media changes.
This being said, it could be argued that despite the differences in
the way the two fish species react to light, they both exhibit a VMR.

There were no statistically significant effects of MeHg exposure
on the locomotor activity of yellow perch throughout each of the 10
min intervals of the VMR assay. However, differences were identified
in the locomotor activity of the 21 dpf MeHg-exposed yellow perch
throughout the duration of the whole experiment. This approach identified
hyperactivity in larvae exposed to 30 nM MeHg and hypoactivity in
larvae exposed to 100 nM MeHg. Increases in locomotion in the 30 nM
exposure group were unexpected because we did not observe hyperactivity
in any other experiment in this study. This result suggests that increased
locomotion in larval yellow perch exposed to 30 nM MeHg during the
VMR assay could be specifically linked to an increased excitability
to visual stimuli.

The swimming and foraging efficiency experiments
using 25 dpf larvae
were done consecutively to assess if there was a relationship between
locomotor output and prey capture. All MeHg-exposed individuals tested
in the spontaneous swimming experiment exhibited lower locomotor output,
as had been observed in 17 dpf larvae. Furthermore, foraging efficiency
was only significantly reduced in 100 nM MeHg-exposed larvae. Interestingly,
this same exposure group performed poorly in the VMR assay, suggesting
that this assay could have value as a diagnostic tool to predict behavioral
abnormalities later in development.

Remarkably, few studies
have linked environmental toxicant exposure
with impaired foraging behavior of larval fish, most of which were
completed by a single research group that has focused on the effects
of MeHg in killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus);28,29 other studies have performed embryonic MeHg
exposures in fish, but only elucidated foraging impairments at the
onset of adulthood.30 Although all MeHg-exposed
yellow perch larvae appeared to have an overall reduction in foraging,
a statistically significant reduction was observed in the 100 nM MeHg
exposure group, but not in organisms exposed to 300 nM. Yellow perch
are known to be notably resistant to heavy metal exposure;31 thus, it is possible that exposures to higher
concentrations of MeHg may have caused mortality among the most MeHg-sensitive
organisms, thus shifting this exposure group to a more MeHg-tolerant
cohort. Our observations of lower foraging efficiency in 100 nM MeHg-exposed
embryos correspond to a decreased locomotor activity observed at 17,
21, and 25 dpf. This positive relationship between locomotor activity
and foraging activity was also observed in our zebrafish study;1 however, in the said study, MeHg exposure caused
an increase in locomotor activity and foraging efficiency in zebrafish
larvae. The direct waterborne MeHg exposure of zebrafish embryos,
per procedures analogous to those in the present yellow perch study,
also caused hyperactivity.32 These differences
in behavioral outcomes may be attributable to not only the inherent
distinctions between species but also exposure duration and critical
windows of exposures during development. These observations underline
the current difficulties of estimating the effects of environmental
contaminants on nonmodel organisms on the basis of data collected
from model organisms; thus, an effort must be made to match experimental
conditions when analyzing behavioral end points in different species
of organisms. Moreover, it is important to recognize the need to diversify
our understanding of the subtle (i.e., nonlethal) effects of environmental
contaminants on end points that can be easily placed in an ecological
context (i.e., foraging and predator avoidance) to facilitate the
assessment of ecological risk on the basis of laboratory-derived toxicity
assays.

Our results confirm the notion of a positive relationship
between
locomotor output and prey capture, which is a common assumption when
creating simulation models of predator–prey interaction.17 This notion held true for our observations of
hypoactivity coupled with decreased foraging in yellow perch larvae,
as well as our previous observations of increased locomotion and increased
foraging efficiency in zebrafish.1 Although
the THg embryo burdens yielded in the current study were higher than
expected in nature, our study is the first to investigate the effects
of MeHg on relevant survival behaviors of yellow perch larvae, thus
establishing a precedence for the assessment of the potentially harmful
effects of toxic compounds on this ecologically relevant species.

Materials
and Methods
The procedures for the rearing of yellow perch
embryos, MeHg exposure,
and behavioral analysis are described below and summarized in Figure 1. All behavioral
analyses were conducted from 12:00 pm to 7:00 pm to limit the effects
of circadian rhythms.27

Embryo Procurement, Methylmercury
Exposure, and Dosimetry
All protocols for the care and handling
of yellow perch were approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the
University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee (Milwaukee, WI). Egg masses were
obtained from sexually mature yellow perch kept as a broodstock in
the Great Lakes Aquaculture Center (School of Freshwater Sciences,
University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee). The eggs were collected from
15 pairwise breedings, whereby the egg mass from each female was fertilized
with the sperm of randomly selected males. The fertilized eggs were
kept in a cooler at 10 °C at all times. The 15 fertilized egg
masses were then divided into three biological replicates, each one
incorporating eggs from five different spawning pairs; all experiments
described hereafter were conducted with these three replicate sets
of fertilized eggs.

When spawning, female yellow perch extrude
up to 40 000 eggs into a long and continuous “accordion-folded”
strand that is 4–5 cm thick and approximately a meter long.33,34 The egg masses were cut into small ribbons containing roughly 10
fertilized eggs each. A total of five ribbons (one from each spawning
pair) were placed in a metal-free, plastic culture dish (100 mm diameter
× 15 mm depth) containing 50 mL of E2 embryo medium (15 mM NaCl,
0.5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO4, 150 μM KH2PO4, 50 μM Na2HPO4, 1 mM CaCl2, and 0.7 mM NaHCO3). A total of 3750 embryos were
reared ex vivo, accounting for 3 biological replicates, 5 MeHg exposure
concentrations, and 5 culture dishes per exposure group with each
containing 50 embryos (Figure 1). Immediately after distributing the egg ribbons into culture
dishes, the developing embryos had reached the 128-cell stage (∼12
h post fertilization [hpf]). At this point, the E2 medium of each
culture dish was removed and quickly replaced with 50 mL of MeHg-contaminated
E2 medium (0, 30, 100, 300, and 1000 nM [0, 0.006, 0.022, 0.065, and
0.216 ppm, respectively]; 0.033% ethanol was used as a vehicle in
all solutions including control), as previously described.35,36 This direct exposure method using newly fertilized embryos is intended
to mimic the maternal transfer of MeHg to the offspring and is a common
exposure procedure for chemical toxicity assays in zebrafish embryos.32,37 The yellow perch embryos remained in the exposure solutions incubated
at 10 °C for 20 h, after which all dishes were rinsed three times
with fresh 10 °C E2 medium to stop any further MeHg exposure.
Once the eggs were thoroughly rinsed, they were kept in fresh E2 medium
and returned to the incubator; the E2 medium was exchanged daily. The incubation of the
embryos was initiated at the temperature of 10 °C (as stated
above) and progressively increased by 1 °C every second day until
a final temperature of 20 °C was attained.

At 14 dpf, the
embryos were assisted to hatch by vigorously pipetting
them using a 25 mL pipette. Chorion debris and dead embryos were removed
from each culture dish, and live embryos were immediately counted.
The embryos developmentally exposed to 1000 nM MeHg exhibited a significant
decrease in posthatch survival at 14 dpf; thus, this cohort was excluded
from the behavioral analyses (Table 1). Upon initiation of spontaneous swimming at 17 dpf,
pools of 10 randomly selected individuals per exposure group (0, 30,
100, and 300 nM) were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen (in triplicate)
and stored for later analysis of THg. THg contents in whole embryo
tissues were analyzed on a wet weight basis using a Direct Mercury
Analyzer 80 (DMA-80; Milestone Inc, Shelton, CT), as described by
Basu and collaborators.38 Assay performance
was deemed acceptable according to U.S. EPA Method 7473 performance
criteria guidelines and in consideration of the values measured in
the fish samples. Briefly, the detection limit (mean value of blanks
plus 3× the standard deviation of the mean; n = 33) was 0.21 ng total Hg. Analyses (n = 12) of
a relevant certified reference material (DORM-4, National Research
Council of Canada) revealed an analytical accuracy of 102.3 ±
4.8% (mean ± SD) and a precision of 4.7 ± 2.6%.

Analysis of
Swimming Behavior at 17 dpf
Yellow perch
larvae initiate swimming at 17 dpf and thus behavioral analyses commenced
at this time point. Commonly, the locomotor activity is evaluated
both in the dark and in the light to account for any possible effects
of illumination on the behavioral responses of the experimental organisms.39 Here, we analyzed the spontaneous swimming activity
of 17 dpf yellow perch larvae in constant light and constant darkness
for 15 min, after a 5 min acclimation period; experiments in the presence
and absence of light were conducted in parallel using different test
organisms for each lighting condition (i.e., one group of organisms
was assigned to be analyzed in the dark, another was analyzed in the
light). Individual larvae were transferred into the wells of a transparent
24-well microtiter plate (Costar; Corning, NY), and their spontaneous
swimming activity was evaluated using two DanioVision systems (Noldus
Information Technology, Leesburg, VA) to increase throughput. Each
plate contained six larvae from each exposure cohort. A total of 15
plates were analyzed per lighting condition (n =
15 plates analyzed in constant light; n = 15 plates
analyzed in constant darkness). The total distance traveled of each
fish was calculated using EthoVision software version 8.0 (Noldus
Information Technology).

Analysis of Visual Motor Response at 21 dpf
The visual
motor response (VMR) assay has been extensively described in the zebrafish
as a complex behavioral paradigm that integrates both the visual perception
and the locomotion of the fish.40 This
experiment consists of tracking larva activity and abruptly changing
the light intensity in an enclosed observation chamber every 10–20
min. At 21 dpf, larvae were transferred to 24-well microtiter plates
(as described above in the analysis of 17 dpf larvae). Six 24-well
plates were analyzed in total (n = 36 larvae per
MeHg exposure). The larvae were acclimated for 10 min in the dark,
after which they underwent two cycles of alternating 10 min light
and dark periods for a total of 50 min. Larva activity was evaluated
using a DanioVision system and EthoVision software version 8.0, as
described above.

Analysis of Swimming Behavior and Foraging
Efficiency at 25
dpf
At 25 dpf, spontaneous swimming was evaluated again prior
to the assessment of foraging efficiency. The larvae were analyzed
in a custom-made behavior observation chamber, as described in two
previous studies.1,32 All video recordings were streamed
to a remote computer at a resolution of 960 × 720 pixels and
a frame rate of 30 frames per second (fps) via the MATLAB image acquisition
toolbox (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA).

At 9:00 am on the
day of the analysis, thirty 25 dpf larvae were transferred to glass
culture dishes (100 mm diameter × 15 mm depth) containing 50
mL of clean E2 medium (20 °C). The dish was then transferred
to the recording chamber, and the larvae were acclimated for 5 min,
after which they were recorded for 10 min to assess spontaneous swimming.
A total of 4 culture dishes containing 30 larvae each were recorded
per MeHg exposure (n = 120 larvae per exposure).
Our laboratory has successfully implemented machine vision algorithms
to quantify the behavior of multiple zebrafish larvae in the same
arena.1,32 However, yellow perch larvae proved to be
more challenging to track due to their lack of pigmentation and a
tendency to aggregate and remain immotile for long periods of time.
Therefore, the locomotor activity of yellow perch larvae was tracked
manually with the “Manual Tracking” ImageJ plugin41,42 (Supporting Information, Video S1). A 30 s fragment was selected from
the 10 min videos (from 5 min, 0 s [5:00] to 5 min, 30 s [5:30]) and
then this video was converted from 30 to 6 fps to facilitate manual
frame-by-frame analysis of the footage. Total distance traveled (mm
in 30 s), percent of time active (% activity), and net-to-gross displacement
ratio (NGDR) were calculated for each individual larva via a custom
Microsoft Excel Macro (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). NGDR is a measurement
of trajectory linearity, where displacement is the linear distance
between the beginning, the ending point and the gross displacement
is the total distance traveled to get from one point to the next,
and NGDR that approximated 1 indicates a linear path.17 Immediately after the recording of spontaneous swimming,
foraging efficiency was evaluated (n = 4 groups of
30 larvae) by introducing 5 Artemia nauplii per larva (i.e., 30 larvae per dish, foraging on 150 nauplii)
into the culture dish. The larvae were allowed to feed for 10 min,
after which the remaining nauplii were manually counted.

Data Processing
and Statistical Analysis
Statistical
analyses were conducted with SigmaPlot software version 11.0 (Systat
Software, San Jose, CA). Measured concentrations of THg in the embryos
were log-transformed prior to statistical analysis via one-way ANOVA
due to the 3- to 12-fold differences between exposure groups. Statistical
analysis of the spontaneous swimming of 17 dpf larvae exposed to different
MeHg exposures and lighting conditions (i.e., constant light and constant
dark) was performed using two-way ANOVA. The VMRs of 21 dpf larvae
were analyzed with two-way repeated measures ANOVA. Total distance
traveled (mm in 30 s), % activity, NGDR, and foraging efficiency in
25 dpf larvae were analyzed using one-way ANOVA. For all statistically
significant results, post hoc multiple pairwise comparisons were performed
via the Holm-Sidak method. P < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant in all analyses.
