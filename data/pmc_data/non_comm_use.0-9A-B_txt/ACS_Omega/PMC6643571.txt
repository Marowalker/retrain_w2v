Inorganic
benzene-like clusters with a planar hexagonal ring are
of interest in chemistry, as are new types of aromaticity, multifold
aromaticity, and in particular δ aromaticity beyond carbon-based
organic systems. Here we report on a computational study of chemical
bonding in a binary Os3N3+D3h (7A2″) cluster. This transition metal nitride cluster assumes
a perfectly planar, heteroatomic, hexagonal geometry. An array of
quantum chemistry tools is exploited to elucidate the electronic,
structural, and bonding properties of D3h Os3N3+ cluster,
which include canonical molecular orbitals, adaptive natural density
partitioning, natural bond orbital analysis, orbital composition calculations,
and nucleus-independent chemical shifts. The computational data collectively
support the bonding picture of 2-fold π/δ aromaticity:
6π electrons delocalized over all Os/N centers versus an Os-based
4δ framework in the unique δ2δ*1δ*1 configuration. The π sextet renders this
heteroatomic cluster an inorganic analog of benzene. Transition metal-based
inorganic benzenes are unknown in the literature, to our knowledge.
The triplet 4δ electron-counting is a rare case of d-orbital
aromaticity and δ-aromaticity, following the reversed 4n Hückel rule for aromaticity in a triplet system.
This bonding picture is concrete, differing fundamentally from a recent
study on the relevant system.

1 Introduction
Aromaticity
is an old and yet never outdated chemical concept,
being introduced 150 years ago by Kekulé to account for the
unusual properties of benzene.1 In 1931,
Hückel formulated the (4n + 2) π electron-counting
rule for aromaticity in planar monocyclic carbon ring systems. About
35 years later, Breslow introduced the concept of antiaromaticity
for cyclobutadiene with 4n π electrons.2 Subsequently, σ aromaticity and antiaromaticity
were also proposed. In 1979, Schleyer and co-workers described the
first molecular system with double π/σ aromaticity.3

Since the turn of 21st century, new types
of aromaticity were discovered,
such as all-metal aromaticity,4−6 d-orbital aromaticity,7−9 and δ-aromaticity.10 Note that
d-orbital aromaticity and δ-aromaticity are possible only in
transition metal systems, which distinguish these species from classical
carbon-based organic aromatic molecules. Three-fold σ/π/δ
aromaticity was also discussed,11,12 as was ϕ-aromaticity.13 The concept of aromaticity has been accompanied
by active debates since the 1970s,14,15 which nonetheless
motivated further research activities and developments in the field.16−29 Computational efforts were also devoted to the design of new aromatic
compounds (such as heterodecked sandwiches), using aromatic clusters
as building blocks.30−43 Among notable works in metalloaromaticity, Robinson and co-workers5 reported in 1995 an organometallic compound,
which contains a triangular Ga32– ring
with 2π electrons, making an all-metal π aromatic system.
In 2001, Wang and Boldyrev6 reported a
gas-phase Al42– cluster, which features
multiple (π and σ) aromaticity. The first δ-aromatic
species is the Ta3O3– cluster,
reported by Zhai et al. in 2007.10

Another aspect of aromaticity comes from the novel heterocyclic
molecules, which can mimic the structure and bonding of benzene, a
prototypical aromatic molecule. Among the so-called “inorganic
benzene” molecules are borazine and boroxine. They have the
formula of B3N3H6 and B3O3H3, respectively, in which the hexagonal
B3N3 and B3O3 rings support
an aromatic π sextet, similar to benzene. In a recent computational
study, Li et al.44 designed a boronyl boroxine D3h B6O6 cluster. It can be alternatively formulated as B3O3(BO)3, that is, a boroxol B3O3 ring terminated on the B sites by three boronyl groups.45 Since boronyl is a robust monovalent σ
ligand, boronyl boroxine is exactly isoelectronic to boroxine (and
hence borazine and benzene), which justifies the classification of
boronyl boroxine as an inorganic benzene. Can transition metal-based
heterocyclic ring clusters support a delocalized π sextet? Can
such binary clusters join the inorganic benzene family as new members?
These are still open questions, to the best of our knowledge.

The title cluster, Os3N3+, appears
to be interesting in terms of chemical bonding for two reasons. First,
this transition metal nitride cluster assumes a heteroatomic hexagonal
geometry, in which the N atoms may facilitate π delocalization
due to their electronic configuration of 2s22p3, thus offering the potential for a new inorganic benzene species.
Second, the Os centers can in principle support d-orbital delocalization,
which likely leads to d-orbital aromaticity, or more intriguingly,
δ-aromaticity. In fact, the Os3N3+ cluster was computationally studied in a recent paper by
Jin et al.,46 who reported the D3h Os3N3+ geometry and specifically claimed triple (σ, π,
and δ) aromaticity. However, chemical bonding in the Os3N3+ cluster turns out to be rather complicated
and challenging. As we will show throughout this paper, the bonding
picture of the Jin paper is incomplete and with fundamental flaws.

In light of the rich and novel bonding in the Os3N3+ cluster, we choose to revisit the system and
carry out in-depth chemical bonding analyses. Our computational effort
makes use of electronic structure calculations at the B3LYP47 and PBE0 levels,48,49 extensive
canonical molecular orbital (CMO) analysis, natural bond orbital (NBO)
analysis,50 orbital composition calculations,51 and nucleus-independent chemical shifts (NICSs).52 Complementary adaptive natural density partitioning
(AdNDP)53 analysis is also performed, albeit
with limited data due to the highly open-shell system. The concerted
quantum chemical data allows a thorough understanding of the nature
of bonding in the Os3N3+D3h (7A2″) cluster. The cluster turns out to be an inorganic analog
of benzene, featuring a global π sextet. Furthermore, it possesses
δ-aromaticity, in which three Os centers support a unique δ
framework in the δ2δ*1δ*1 configuration, following the reversed 4n Hückel rule for aromaticity in a triplet system.54 Two-fold π/δ aromaticity in the D3h Os3N3+ cluster makes it highly interesting in chemical bonding,
whose bonding picture differs from that of the Jin paper46 on relevant species. It is also stressed that
transition metal-based inorganic benzene molecules are unknown in
the literature, with the current D3h Os3N3+ cluster being the
first example. Considering the complexity of the potential energy
surface and the challenging nature of a transition metal-based system
for density-functional theory (DFT), the title cluster may be viewed
as a model system.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 D3h Os3N3+ Cluster: Geometry,
Bond Orders, and Natural Atomic Charges
The Os3N3+D3h (7A2″) cluster, optimized at
the B3LYP/Os/CEP-121G/N/6-311++G* level, is illustrated in Figure 1a. In the present
study, this cluster was also calculated using the PBE0 method. Consistent
data were obtained from the B3LYP and PBE0 calculations; see Table S1 in the Supporting Information. Note
that different spin states were explored in a recent study by Jin
et al.,46 suggesting that the heptet state
is favored for the Os3N3+ cluster
with a margin of 0.3–1.6 eV in energetics. However, our B3LYP
and PBE0 calculations failed to locate the D3h (7A1′) state
of the Jin paper, which could be due to different versions of the
Gaussian package used (Gaussian 03 in the Jin paper). In light of
the fact that B3LYP and PBE0 methods are generally considered to be
complementary with each other, we should conclude that D3h (7A2″)
is the correct electronic state for the Os3N3+ cluster. Furthermore, we have analyzed the wavefunction
stability for Os3N3+ and the result
indicates that the wavefunction is stable under the perturbations
considered. One reviewer suggests an interesting opportunity to examine
the
multiconfigurational character of such a transition metal-based system,
which is legitimate and yet beyond the scope of the present study.
Note that DFT remains the choice for transition metal systems and
the B3LYP method has proved to work well for these systems, as documented
in references cited in this paper. Therefore, only the B3LYP data
for Os3N3+D3h (7A2″) cluster
will be discussed below.

level.
Larger balls represent the Os centers. (a) Optimized geometry along
with the Os–N bond distances (in Å). (b) Wiberg bond indices
(WBIs; black color) and natural atomic charges (in |e|; red color)
via the natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis.

The Os3N3+D3h (7A2″)
cluster
is perfectly planar in geometry, featuring a heteroatomic hexagonal
ring, which appears to be analogous to the C6 ring in benzene
or the B3O3 ring in the boronyl boroxine D3h B6O6 cluster.44 The ∠NOsN bond angle
is 117.01°, compared to 122.99° for ∠OsNOs, both
of which are close to that for an ideal hexagon (120°). The Os–N
bond distance is 1.82 Å (Figure 1a). According to the recommended covalent radii by
Pyykkö,55 the upper bound for typical
Os–N single and Os=N double bonds should be 2.00 and
1.76 Å, respectively. Thus, six Os–N links in the D3h Os3N3+ cluster are markedly shorter than single bonds. Indeed,
Wiberg bond indices (WBIs) from the NBO analysis are 1.31 for Os–N
bonds (Figure 1b).

Also, there seems to be discernible Os–Os bonding in the
cluster, with an Os–Os distance of 3.19 Å and WBI of 0.28,
the latter hinting for delocalized Os–Os bonding in the system.
In contrast, the N–N distance in the cluster is 3.10 Å,
far longer than the upper bound for single bond (1.42 Å),55 suggesting that there is no N–N bonding.
In summary, bond distances and WBIs indicate that delocalized Os–N
and Os–Os bonding is present in the D3h Os3N3+ cluster.

As a metal nitride species, intramolecular charge
transfer is anticipated
for the Os3N3+D3h (7A2″)
cluster. Natural atomic charges from NBO analysis are −0.58
|e| for N versus +0.92 |e| for Os (Figure 1b). Negative charges on N atoms are moderate.
The slightly larger positive charges on the Os centers are partly
due to the overall charge on the cluster. Such a charge distribution
indicates that the Os–N bonding in the system is remarkably
covalent (vide infra), due to the high electronegativity of Os (2.2
for Os vs 3.04 for N).

2.2 Global π Sextet in
the D3h Os3N3+ Cluster: A Heterocyclic Inorganic Benzene
The primary motivation
of this work is to fully elucidate the essence of bonding in the Os3N3+ cluster, which is of interest for
a number of reasons. First, the Os3N3+ cluster has a perfectly planar, nearly ideal hexagonal ring structure.
Such a heteroatomic cluster can be a candidate for inorganic benzenes,
whose family members include borazine, boroxine, and boronyl boroxine.44 The globally delocalized π sextet is known
to govern the stability of these ring species. Second, transition
metal-based inorganic benzenes are nonexistent in the literature,
and thus the Os3N3+ cluster can be
the first example, if confirmed. Third, the Os–Os bonding in
the cluster, if delocalized, can be rare in terms of d-orbital aromaticity
and in particular δ-aromaticity, which has not been fully understood,
despite a recent attempt by Jin and co-workers.46 Fourth, we believe that the present bonding picture highlights
the uniqueness of the Os3N3+ cluster
and should stimulate forthcoming exploration of chemical bonding in
transition metal-based clusters.

CMOs offer the most fundamental
bonding information for a molecular system. Thus, we need to perform
a thorough CMO analysis for the Os3N3+D3h (7A2″) cluster. To this end, all occupied CMOs should be
treated, instead of selected CMOs “of interest” only.
Considering the electron configurations of Os 5d66s2 and N 2s22p3, the Os3N3+ cluster has a total of 38 valence electrons.
Because of the heptet state nature of the Os3N3+D3h (7A2″) cluster, a number of CMOs in the system
are singly occupied. In fact, there are 22 occupied CMOs in total,
of which only 16 are fully occupied.

The 22 occupied CMOs of
the D3h Os3N3+ cluster are presented
in Figures 2–4. The highest CMO is singly occupied,
which is denoted as SOMO (that is, a singly occupied molecular orbital).
A deeper CMO is labeled as HOMO–m or SOMO–m, depending on whether it is doubly or singly occupied.
To recognize how a specific Os/N atomic orbital (AO) participates
in a CMO, it is convenient to fix a Cartesian coordinate system on
each Os/N site so that x-, y-, and z-axes point tangentially, radially, and perpendicularly
to the hexagonal ring, respectively. In this way, orbital components
from each N 2px/2py/2pz and Os dxy/dyz/dxz/dx2–y2/dz2 AO can be
identified. Since such AO components are mutually orthogonal and independent
of each other,56,57 a subset of CMOs based on a specific
AO may be grouped and treated collectively.

occupied canonical molecular orbitals (CMOs)

level. SOMO stands for the singly occupied molecular orbital. (a)

(albeit not necessarily lone-pairs).

Figure 3 Pictures of selected CMOs of the D3h Os3N3+ cluster,

are derived from (a) radial, (b) tangential, and (c) vertical N 2p
AOs, respectively, which mix with Os 5d AOs. The six σ CMOs
in (a) and (b) can be effectively viewed as six Lewis Os–N
σ single bonds. The three π CMOs in (c) are all six-center
two-electron (6e–2e) bonds, forming a delocalized π sextet
similar to benzene.

Figure 4 Pictures of three δ
CMOs of the D3h Os3N3+ cluster,
calculated at the B3LYP/Os/CEP-121G/N/6-311++G* level. The CMOs are
largely based on Os dz2 AOs
with a δ2δ*1δ*1 configuration, which are intrinsically delocalized and cannot be
transformed into Lewis elements.

In the present heterocyclic six-membered system, AOs can
combine
to form CMOs within an Os3/N3 triangle, or they
fully mix with each other over six Os/N centers. For the former case,
CMOs should appear as a completely bonding one (zero nodal plane)
and a partially bonding/antibonding pair (degenerate; one nodal plane).
For the latter case, the six-centered CMOs consist of a completely
bonding one, two degenerate bonding/antibonding pairs, and a completely
antibonding one, which have from 0 up to 3 nodal planes. Each of the
above subset of three-center or six-center CMOs, if fully occupied,
can be recombined as lone-pairs or two-center two-electron (2c–2e)
Lewis bonds. In addition, certain CMOs may be considered as nonbonding
electrons (but not necessarily lone-pairs). Beyond these, one finds
delocalized σ/π/δ bonding, that is, aromaticity.

Figure 2 illustrates
10 CMOs that have no, or relatively minor, bonding effect in the Os3N3+ cluster. In subset (a), three CMOs
are derived from N 2s AOs (by around 75%); see Table S2 for the orbital components. HOMO–14 is completely
bonding between three N atoms, although formally only due to large
N–N distances. The degenerate pair HOMO–13/HOMO–13′
are partially bonding/antibonding. Thus, the subset is a typical bonding/partial
bonding/antibonding combination for a three-center system, whose net
effects cancel with each other, resulting in three N 2s2 lone-pairs with negligible bonding. Technically, these CMOs are
readily transformed into three lone-pairs, as borne out from AdNDP
analysis (Figure 5).
Their occupation numbers (ONs) are 1.78 |e|, close to ideal (2.00
|e|), which are indicative of reasonably pure N 2s2 lone-pairs.
We note that AdNDP analysis for the present cluster does not work
beyond this, because it is a highly challenging open-shell system.
The current version of the AdNDP program53 is primarily designed for closed-shell species.

Figure 5 AdNDP bonding pattern
for three N 2s2 lone-pairs of
the D3h Os3N3+ cluster. Occupation numbers (ONs) are shown.
Owing to the complex open-shell configuration of the cluster, AdNDP
analysis beyond N 2s2 lone-pairs is not possible.

Three CMOs in subset (b) in Figure 2 are composed of
Os dyz AOs, with complementary N 2p contribution
in SOMO–1. Here,
HOMO–6/HOMO–6′
are largely composed of Os dyz (four electrons),
whereas SOMO–1 (one electron) has half contribution from Os
dyz (Table S2). The subset is also a bonding/partial bonding/antibonding combination,
which should have little net bonding effect if all CMOs are fully
occupied. However, only five electrons occupy these CMOs, leading
to an incomplete subsystem. As an approximation, this subset is considered
as nonbonding Os 5d electrons.58,59 Note that a completely
bonding CMO, such as SOMO–1, is not necessary the lowest in
energy in a subset, because of the mixture between Os/N atoms. This
mixture is probably associated with charge transfer from Os to N in
the cluster.60

Likewise, subset (d)
in Figure 2 is roughly
attributed to nonbonding Os 5d electrons
(dominated by dx2–y2), whose three CMOs are all half-occupied
and the SOMO has half contribution from N 2py AOs.60 In effect, the SOMO can have some
net bonding due to its six-center nature. However, the overall bonding
effect of this subset is minor, if any. Furthermore, HOMO–4
in subset (c) is composed of Os dxz AOs,
which is largely nonbonding owing to the insertion of N atoms in between
Os centers (although formally antibonding). The above 10 CMOs in Figure 2 are either N 2s2 lone-pairs or nonbonding Os 5d electrons, collectively consuming
16 electrons out of 38 in the system.

Now, we shall identify
CMOs that are relevant to the skeleton Os–N
σ bonds in the heteroatomic ring, which use radial (σr; Figure 3a)
and tangential (σt; Figure 3b) N 2p AOs, respectively, to mix with Os
5d AOs, forming truly six-center bonds. The σr and
σt bonding appears to be highly covalent between
Os and N centers (Table S3). Four out of
six of these CMOs are equally contributed by Os and N, except that
HOMO–7/HOMO–7′ have larger contribution from
N (74.8%). Approximately, one may consider that the N atoms offer
seven electrons to the σr/σt frameworks,
with Os balancing the remaining five electrons. The uneven electron-counting
is associated with HOMO–7/HOMO–7′ (that is, the
σr framework), which effectively transfers one electron
from Os3 to N3.60 This observation is a reflection of the polar nature of Os–N
bonding, although it is relatively moderate. The 12 electrons in σr/σt frameworks of the D3h Os3N3+ cluster are effectively viewed as 6 Os–N 2c–2e σ
bonds, analogous to 6 Lewis C–C σ bonds in benzene. Indeed,
these six CMOs are similar to those in benzene.

Figure 3c presents
the π framework of the D3h Os3N3+ cluster. All three
CMOs are equally contributed by Os and N centers (Table 1), indicative of the covalent
nature of these bonds. The three CMOs constitute a π sextet,
featuring global delocalization in the heteroatomic hexagonal ring,
whose electron-counting conform to the (4n + 2) Hückel
rule for aromaticity. According to the above discussion, the D3h Os3N3+ cluster has a 12-electron Os–N σ skeleton
(Figure 3a,b), as well
as a delocalized π sextet (Figure 3c). These characteristic bonding features
are closely analogous to benzene, thus rendering the D3h Os3N3+ cluster a transition metal nitride analog of benzene. As far as
we know, there appears to be no discussion in the literature on the
analogy between a transition metal-based ring cluster and benzene.
The D3h Os3N3+ cluster adds a new member to the inorganic
benzene family, following borazine, boroxine, and boronyl boroxine.44 This represents a peculiar aspect of bonding
in the D3h Os3N3+ cluster.

2.3 δ-Aromaticity in the D3h Os3N3+ Cluster: Uniqueness of the δ2δ*1δ*1 Configuration
Beyond an inorganic benzene
with a 12-electron σ skeleton and a delocalized π sextet,
the D3h Os3N3+ cluster has 4 more electrons, which occupy
3 CMOs as shown in Figure 4: HOMO–5 and SOMO–2/SOMO–2′. All
three CMOs are Os based (88.1–94.3%; Table 2), which contain major contributions from
Os 5d AOs by 50.5–73.2%, including 40.6–67.6% from Os
dz2 AOs. In other words, Os
dz2 AOs are responsible for
80.4–92.3% of all Os 5d contributions to the three CMOs, thus
justifying the classification of them as δ CMOs.

CMOs, which represent 80.4, 80.4, and 92.3% of all 5d contributions,
respectively. These quantitative data justify the classification of
SOMO–2/SOMO–2′/HOMO–5 as δ CMOs.

d SOMO stands for singly occupied
molecular orbital.

In terms
of spatial distribution, HOMO–5 is completely delocalized
and bonding between three Os centers, with two nodal planes parallel
to the molecular plane (δ symmetry in nature), which is similar
to that of the prototypical δ-aromatic Ta3O3– cluster.10 SOMO–2/SOMO–2′
are partially bonding/antibonding. Three CMOs form a typical bonding/antibonding
combination for a three-center system, which can be localized as Lewis
elements (lone-pairs or 2c–2e bonds), if fully occupied. Intriguingly,
this is not the exact case, because SOMO–2/SOMO–2′
are each singly occupied, leading to an unusual configuration of δ2δ*1δ*1 (that is, in a triplet
state).

A triplet system has long been known to follow the reversed
4n Hückel rule for aromaticity, although only
π
systems were discussed previously.54 According
to such reversed rule, a molecular species with 4n electrons, in triplet state, has aromaticity (instead of antiaromaticity).
This is due to the fact that the degenerate partially bonding/antibonding
pair of CMOs in a triplet system are still equally occupied and balanced,
which help maintain high symmetry and electron delocalization in the
species. We believe that the same rule applies for a triplet δ
system, although the δ2δ*1δ*1 configuration does not seem to be known previously. Indeed,
the Os3N3+ cluster has D3h symmetry despite being highly open-shell.
Thus, the δ2δ*1δ*1 framework of the D3h Os3N3+ cluster renders it δ
aromaticity, following the reversed Hückel rule for a triplet
system.

NICS is one of the most popular criteria for aromaticity.52 We have calculated NICS and NICSzz values at the center of the Os3N3+ cluster and 1 Å above it (Table 3). All NICS and NICSzz data turn out to be highly negative, confirming
the assessment of aromaticity for the D3h Os3N3+ cluster.
For comparison, NICS data for benzene are also listed in Table 3. Note that the NICS
data of D3h Os3N3+ cluster are far greater than those of boroxine
and boronyl boroxine,44 which suggest that
the Os3N3+ cluster as a new member
of the inorganic benzene family is highly aromatic, consistent with
the truly covalent nature of Os–N π bonding (Table 1).

2.4 An Overall Chemical Bonding Model of the D3h Os3N3+ Cluster
At this point, we shall summarize our
chemical bonding picture for the D3h Os3N3+ cluster, which has
been reached via in-depth and thorough CMO analyses. We believe the
picture is solid and clear. Briefly, the D3h Os3N3+ cluster
is a highly open-shell species, with 38 valence electrons occupying
22 CMOs (6 of them singly occupied). Three of these CMOs are responsible
for N 2s2 lone-pairs (6 electrons) and 7 CMOs (10 electrons)
are largely Os 5d based and considered nonbonding, which collectively
use 16 electrons; see Figure 2. This reduces the D3h Os3N3+ cluster down to a
22-electron system.

The Os–N σ skeleton consumes
12 electrons in the σr/σt framework,
which are effectively viewed as 6 2c–2e Os–N Lewis σ
bonds (Figure 3a,b).
The remaining 10 electrons give rise to 2-fold π/δ aromaticity
in the system: global π sextet in the heteroatomic hexagonal
ring (Figure 3c) versus
a δ2δ*1δ*1 framework
on 3 Os centers (Figure 4). Collectively, the 12-electron σ skeleton in the heterocyclic
ring of the D3h Os3N3+ cluster and the global π sextet
closely resemble those of the C6 ring in benzene. Thus,
the D3h Os3N3+ cluster is a transition metal nitride analog
of benzene, adding a new member to the inorganic benzene family. Note
that the π sextet in the D3h Os3N3+ cluster is highly
covalent between Os and N via typical d–p π bonding.
The δ2δ*1δ*1 framework
renders the cluster δ aromaticity following the reversed Hückel
rule for a triplet system, which is the only bonding component among
the Os centers, consistent with low WBI values of 0.28 for the Os–Os
links in D3h Os3N3+ cluster. We stress that the present bonding
model, as illustrated in Figure 6, differs fundamentally from the Jin paper.46

Figure 6 Overall bonding picture of the D3h Os3N3+ cluster.
The N 2s2 lone-pairs (3 CMOs with 6 electrons) and nonbonding
Os 5d electrons (7 CMOs with 10 electrons) are not shown for clarity,
which reduce the system from 38 down to 22 electrons. Black lines
represent the skeleton 2c–2e Os–N σ single bonds.
(a) Global π sextet (in red color) similar to benzene. (b) Unique
δ2δ*1δ*1 configuration
(in blue color) renders the cluster δ-aromaticity according
to the reversed 4n Hückel rule for aromaticity
in a triplet system.

As for the anion Os3N3– cluster, our preliminary B3LYP calculation leads to a quintet state, D3h (5A2″), which is also a planar hexagonal cluster. Compared to
the Os3N3+ cluster, two extra electrons
in Os3N3–D3h (5A2″)
enter SOMO−3/SOMO−3′ in Os3N3+ (Figure 2d) and turn them into HOMO−3/HOMO−3′ in Os3N3– (not shown). Since such CMOs
are ascribed to Os nonbonding, two extra electrons in Os3N3–D3h (5A2″) do not alter
the nature of double π/δ aromaticity.

The bonding
model of Os3N3+ cluster
in the Jin paper requires refinement for a number of reasons. First,
although the Os3N3+ cluster is clearly
a 38-electron system, the Jin paper only discussed CMOs for 28 electrons,
which is unlikely to reach a complete bonding picture, because chemical
bonding analysis needs to properly treat all occupied CMOs, rather
than a selected part of them. Second, two CMOs (HOMO−12 and
HOMO−12′; Figure 3b) were completely ignored in the Jin paper. This ignorance
does not allow a correct and complete skeleton Os–N σ
bonding picture to be obtained. Third, the Jin paper considered SOMO−2/SOMO−2′
(Figure 4) to be σ
antibonding, which is wrong. This error not only gave an incorrect
picture for σ bonding, but also led to a distorted δ framework.
In such a case, the Jin paper did not succeed in getting the essence
of δ bonding in the system, even if they indeed claimed “δ
aromaticity”. Specifically, the unique δ2δ*1δ*1 bonding was missed for the cluster. Fourth,
the Jin paper sorted HOMO−11 (Figure 3a) as completely σ bonding, whereas
SOMO−2/SOMO−2′ (Figure 4) and SOMO−3/SOMO−3′
(Figure 2d) are σ
antibonding. These five CMOs belong to three subsets as reasoned in
this paper, which should not be confused and counted collectively
as one σ subsystem. Fifth, the Jin paper mixed HOMO−8
(Figure 3c) with HOMO−6/HOMO−6′
(Figure 2b) and HOMO−9/HOMO−9′
(Figure 3c) as a π
bonding/antibonding subset, which are actually not a series of CMOs
according to the building principles.

We reiterate that intramolecular
charge transfer in the D3h Os3N3+ cluster is moderate via
four CMOs only, resulting in
a formal N– charge state in the cluster. Although
the skeleton Os–N σ bonds reflect certain polar nature,
the global π sextet is completely covalent (Table 1). We believe the covalent nature
of Os–N bonding underlies the unique 2-fold π/δ
aromaticity in the system, which stabilizes the D3h Os3N3+ cluster.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion,
we have performed a density-functional theory study
on chemical bonding of a planar heteroatomic hexagonal Os3N3+D3h (7A2″) cluster, which is based
on CMO analyses with the aid of WBIs and natural atomic charges from
NBO analysis, orbital composition calculations, and NICS data. The
computational results firmly establish that the D3h Os3N3+ cluster has 2-fold π/δ aromaticity. The π sextet
is globally delocalized over the hexagonal ring, making the Os3N3+ cluster a new member of the family
of inorganic benzene molecules. Intriguingly, the δ2δ*1δ*1 framework is located on
three Os centers, whose nature of delocalization and 4δ electron-counting
are in the spirit of aromaticity in a triplet system, following the
reversed 4n Hückel rule. The present bonding
model for the D3h Os3N3+ cluster makes it a highly unusual
chemical species. Note that inorganic benzenes are rare, as are clusters
with d-orbital aromaticity and in particular δ-aromaticity.
Specifically, a transition metal-based δ2δ*1δ*1 aromatic system is unknown in the literature,
to the best of our knowledge.

4 Methods Section
The geometric structure of the Os3N3+ cluster was initially constructed based on the literature.46 Full structural reoptimization were carried
out at the B3LYP level using the basis set of Os/CEP-121G/N/6-311++G*.61−64 Vibrational frequencies were calculated at the same level to verify
that the reported geometry is a true minimum; note that the prior
work46 has explored the potential energy
surface for several spin states. Since the present D3h (7A2″)
structure of the Os3N3+ cluster at
B3LYP differs slightly from that of Jin et al. in terms of electronic
state, we also performed structural optimization at the PBE0 level
with the same basis set. This independent check confirms the D3h (7A2″) structure.

To elucidate chemical bonding in the system,
extensive CMO analyses
were carried out, which were aided with NBO analysis50 and orbital composition calculations.51 NBO analysis offers WBIs and natural atomic charges. AdNDP
analysis was also performed, although it generated limited data for
such an open-shell system. Since the AdNDP method is not sensitive
to the basis set used, we chose to carry out this analysis at the
B3LYP/LANL2DZ level.65,66 NICS calculations52 were performed to assess and confirm aromaticity
in the system. CMOs and AdNDP results were visualized using GaussView67 and Molekel.68 Orbital
composition analysis was performed using Multiwfn.51 AdNDP analysis was performed using the AdNDP program.53 All other calculations were carried out using
the Gaussian 09 package.69

The N 2s, 2px, 2py,
and 2pz AOs clearly dominate the subsets of CMOs in Figures
2a, 3a–c, respectively, which exhaust all N 2s22p3 electrons. This observation justifies that the remaining
CMOs in the system (Figures 2b–d and 4) should be attributed
primarily to the Os centers.


For the Os 5d66s2 electrons
(24 in total), there appears to be strong s/d mixing in the cluster.
These electrons are consumed as follows: One for the overall positive
charge in the cluster, 10 as “nonbonding” electrons
(including partial charge transfer of one electron from Os to N via
SOMO and SOMO–1; Figure 2b–d), nine for the Os-N σ/π
bonding (including partial charge transfer of one electron from Os
to N via HOMO–7/HOMO–7′; Figure 3), and four
for Os3 δ bonding.


Charge transfer from Os to N in D3h Os3N3+ cluster
takes places via a number of CMOs, which include SOMO, SOMO–1,
and HOMO–7/HOMO–7′. About two electrons are transferred
from Os3 to N3 and the N atoms should be formally
viewed as N– (compared to natural charge of −0.58
|e|; Figure 1b). The larger positive charges on Os centers (+0.92
|e|) are further contributed by the overall positive charge on the
cluster.
