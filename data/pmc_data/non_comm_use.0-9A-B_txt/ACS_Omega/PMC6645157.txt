A series of seven N-phenylamides [R–C(O)NHPh,
in which R: CH3, C(CH3)3, Ph, CF3, CCl3, CBr3, and H] were used as models
in this study. Molecular packing and intermolecular interactions were
evaluated by theoretical calculations, solution NMR, and quantum theory
of atoms in molecules analyses. Crystallization mechanisms were proposed
based on the energetic and topological parameters using the supramolecular
cluster as demarcation. Concentration-dependent 1H NMR
experiments corroborated the proposed interactions between molecules.
For all compounds (except for R: H, which initially formed tetramers),
layers (two-dimensional) or chains (one-dimensional) were formed in
the first stage of the proposed crystallization mechanisms. The presence
of strong intermolecular NH···O=C interactions
promoted the first stages. The study in solution provided different
values of association constant (Kass)
governed by the hydrogen bond NH···O=C, showing
that the stronger interactions are directly influenced by the substituent
steric hindrance. A correlation between Kass(NH···O=C) from the solution and the NH···O=C interaction
energy in the crystal showed a good trend.

Introduction
The design of new molecular
solids with desired properties and
functions propels the development of crystal engineering.1 Several molecular models promote the development
of network predictions and understanding of the role of the interactions
in the stabilization of molecular solids. This knowledge is widely
explored in the construction of molecular machines,2 molecular catalysts,3 self-association,4 cocrystals,5 solvates,
and polymorphs.6

Hydrogen bonds and
weak interactions, such as van der Waals interactions,
play an important role in the crystalline packing of organic compounds.
Furthermore, theoretical studies have contributed to the characterization
and description of these interactions. The QTAIM (quantum theory of
atoms in molecules) analysis is a powerful tool used to analyze the
strength of intra-/intermolecular interactions that stabilize crystal
structures.7,8 Similarly, the molecular reactivity can
be obtained by measuring the molecular electrostatic potential (MEP)
based on regions of positive and negative potentials.9

In addition to theoretical tools, experimental approaches
using 1H NMR are used to explore interactions, including
π···π
or hydrogen bonds, reflecting the aggregation of the molecules in
the solution. Titration experiments of host–guest10 and self-assembly11 reflect the strength of interactions in supramolecular chemistry.
Then, the data are compared and fitted to binding models in order
to obtain information such as the association constant Kass.12

Among the various
classes of compounds, the study of amides is
of great relevance. The hydrogen-bonding abilities of amides are important
in biological systems, drugs, and commercial fields, in addition to
being much appreciated in crystal engineering. The amide linkage provides
structural rigidity and selectivity in crystals. In recent investigation,
Chopra et al.13 investigated the characteristics
of intermolecular interactions in a series of N-aryl-2-naphthamides
and evidenced the strong intermolecular NH···O=C
interactions, CH···π, and π···π
stacking which help to stabilize the molecules. This approach describes
the crystalline structure and uses motifs to explain packing.

Some approaches of crystalline packing are based on pure geometrical
considerations and overlook energy data.14,15 Moreover, a little is known on crystallization mechanisms that involve
the stages of molecular aggregation to form crystals. In this context,
our research group has proposed crystallization mechanisms for organic
compounds (e.g., isoxazoles and triazenes).16,17 These proposals are based on energetic and topological contributions
related to the interactions between the molecules in each stage of
crystallization mechanisms. Moreover, the supramolecular
cluster was first used as the demarcation of the smallest portion
required for the full characterization of all intermolecular interactions
in the crystal structure.18

In this
context, this study aimed to systematically and quantitatively
explore the packing of a series of N-phenylamides 1–7 (Figure 1) containing substituents with different characteristics and
volumes. In addition, crystallization mechanisms are proposed, addressing
the main stages of the entire process while corroborated by the solution
NMR. This study was carried out in solid and solution NMR, single-crystal
X-ray diffraction, and theoretical [density functional theory (DFT)
calculations, MEP, and QTAIM] data.

Results and Discussion
Molecular Structure
N-phenylamides 1–7 used in this study have their
molecular structures
comprised a phenyl ring linked to the substituents by a NHC(O) amide
unit (Figure 1). All
compounds were synthesized in our laboratory according to the methodology
already described in the literature (see Experimental
Section). A set of structures 1–3 and 5–7 were taken from the Cambridge Structural Database
(CSD).19 Crystals of compound 4 were obtained from crystallization by vapor diffusion using hexane
and chloroform for a single-crystal X-ray analysis. The ORTEP of compound 4 is shown in Figure 2, and details of X-ray measurements and crystal data are given
in Table S1 (Supporting Information).

Figure 2 ORTEP
diagram for compound 4 (named 4A and 4B). Thermal ellipsoids are shown with 50% probability.

The two molecules of the asymmetric
unit in Figure 2 have
different torsions of the amide group
in relation to the aromatic ring. Molecule 4A has an
angle between the planes of the phenyl ring and the amide unit of
32.2°, and molecule 4B has an angle of 36.3°.
Compounds 1–3 and 5–6 presented
one molecule in the asymmetric unit (Z′ =
1), and compounds 4 and 7 presented two
molecules (Z′ = 2). Compound 7 has two conformational isomers: Z (7A) and E (7B), which were presented as a cocrystal by Levendis et al.20

Cable et al.21 reported that the Z isomer
adopts a planar structure and is 2.5 kcal mol–1 more
stable than its E isomer. In the solution, 1H NMR experiments
determined the existence of the mixture of species Z and E with almost
the same abundance in a chloroform solution.22 On the other hand, compound 1 was found almost entirely
as the Z isomer, existing as the effect of steric interactions between
the methyl and phenyl groups.21

Solid-state
NMR [13C cross-polarization/magic-angle
spinning (CP/MAS) NMR] spectroscopy experiments were performed in
order to investigate the presence of conformers or polymorphs for
the compounds. The comparison between solution and solid-state NMR
spectra for compound 7 is shown in Figure 3a,b, respectively. Similar to the solution
spectrum, duplicated signals can be observed, which indicates that
the conformers Z and E can be present in the polycrystalline sample.
Another possibility is the existence of more than one crystalline
phase. Considering that compounds 1–6 did not
present duplicated signals, it is plausible that there is only one
crystalline phase. All other compounds have their spectra in the Supporting Information (Figures S22–S27).
Except for compound 7, all other compounds used in this
study showed only Z conformers in both solution and crystal phases.

The crystal structure of the compounds shows that the amide
unit
tends to increase its deviation in relation to the plane of the phenyl
ring influenced by the increase of the substituent volume. The angles
(θ1) obtained between the constructed planes of the
amide unit (N–C=O) and phenyl ring are illustrated and
described in Table 1. The isomers of compound 7 exhibited differences between
them. The Z form (7A) had a deviation of about 11°,
and the E form (7B) was practically planar. The remaining
compounds presented deviations that ranged from 16° to 39°,
regarding the increase of the substituent volume. The first value
corresponded to the methyl substituent (1) and the last
one to the tribromomethyl substituent.

c Charton’s steric parameters
were taken from ref (23).

The overlay diagram for
compounds 1–7 can be
observed in Table 1, in which the phenyl ring is used as a rigid part to overlay all
structures. According to the overlay results, the structures reveal
considerable conformational flexibility between the phenyl ring and
amide unit. Another data obtained from the overlay of the molecules
are the root mean square (RMS) as a measure of the magnitude of the
overlay. Compound 1 was used as reference while considering
the methyl substituent as a pattern [because the hydrogen-substituted
compound (7) has Z′ = 2]. The
highest values refer to compounds 3 and 4A because of the twisting of the plane to the opposite direction of
the others. The 0.574 value of compound 7B reflects the
unique E conformation adopted.

The most widely used quantitative
measurement of steric effects
is the Es values, proposed by Taft24 and subsequently modified by Charton (υ).25 In this manner, a good tendency can be obtained
by correlating the steric effect presented by Charton (υ) (Table 1) with the angles
(θ1) between the N–C=O/phenyl planes
(θ1 = 15.362υ + 13.206; r =
0.82), shown in Figure 4. Therefore, the substituents may have direct influence in the torsion
between the measured planes. Compound 7B was not considered
in the correlation because it only involves molecules in the Z conformation.

(θ1) and Charton’s steric parameter (υ)

Additionally, MEP26−28 maps were generated for the molecules investigated. The MEPs of 4, 5, and 6 highlighted the presence
of the σ-hole in the direction of the C–X bond.29 The values of Vmax and Vmin and other important regions
of the molecules are presented in the Supporting Information (Figure S1 and Table S2).

Supramolecular Structure
Contact area and stabilization
energy data provide important information about the crystalline lattice,
which helps to better understand the molecular packing in the crystal
(e.g., crystallization mechanism). The first studies in the area were
proposed by Kitaigorodsky, who defined the existence of the first
sphere of molecular coordination based on molecules that have at least
one contact with any given molecule.30 Subsequently,
the Voronoi–Dirichlet polyhedron (VDP), which is based on Dirichlet’s
terms, was introduced as an approach where two adjacent molecules
sharing the same faces of a polyhedron had a contact area between
them.31

However, demarcation is necessary
to apply these parameters. Our research group has used supramolecular
clusters to obtain all data about interactions between neighboring
molecules (MN) around a reference molecule M1 (M1···MN).18 First, the supramolecular
clusters for compounds 1–7 were determined. For
compounds 4 and 7 with Z′ = 2, one cluster for each molecule was determined. The molecular
coordination number (MCN) was obtained, which is the number of molecules
that have at least one contact with any given molecule. When considering
each molecule of 7 separately, two clusters with MCN
= 15 are found. For compounds 1, 3, and 4 (4A and 4B), an MCN = 14 was found,
whereas an MCN = 16 was found for compounds 2, 5, and 6 (the clusters are shown in Figures S2–S11, Supporting Information).

In addition to
the contact area data obtained from the VDP analysis,
the stabilization energies between molecules of each dimer were determined
by quantum mechanics calculations at ωB97X-D/cc-pVDZ level theory.
Energetic and topological data were normalized to compare different
supramolecular clusters in order to compare the contribution of each
dimer in the parameters presented [e.g., normalized stabilization
energy (NG) and normalized contact area (NC) in each cluster].17,18 Normalization means to reduce all raw data to the same metric (scale)
using the MCN as the reference value. As previously presented by our
research group, the dimers can be classified into four types.18 Type I is represented by interactions with high
energy (large NGM1···MN values) in a small contact area (small NCM1···MN values) usually characterized by strong hydrogen
bonds. Type II corresponds to high interaction energy in a large contact
surface (e.g., π···π interactions). Type
III interaction has low NCM1···MN and NGM1···MN values
with a maximum difference of 0.5 between the two parameters, which
is the interaction type that most frequently appears in crystalline
systems. Type IV interactions have low NGM1···MN values and relatively high NCM1···MN values. The symmetry codes, raw and normalized values
of contact area, and stabilization energy and type of dimer of compound 1 are shown in Table 2. The data for the other compounds are presented in the Supporting Information (Tables S3–S12).
The normalized data of dimers (NG and NC) for compound 1 are presented in Figure 5, for the other compounds (2–7), see the Supporting Information.

et al.18

Through normalized data, it is possible to propose
crystallization
mechanisms based on dimer contribution. The crystallization process
can be viewed as a stepwise process in which molecule association
increases system complexity in the formation of the crystalline solid.
Proposals for these mechanisms can be compared to retrosynthesis applied
in organic chemistry,33 in which the structure
of a target molecule is decomposed into a sequence of progressively
simpler structures along a path ultimately leading to simpler ones.
From the three-dimensional (3D) structure, it is possible to propose
the most probable stages that direct crystal growth based on energetic
criteria while following the concept of retrocrystallization.16,17 In a recent proposal, some parameters based on normalized data evidenced
the predominance and contribution of energy and contact area parameters
in each stage of the crystallization mechanism.17 The NCG% shows the sum of normalized
contact area and stabilization energy contribution of each stage.
Moreover, the NG/NC stage parameter reveals the dominant factor in
each stage (e.g., values >1.0 indicate dominance of the stabilization
energy and values <1.0 show the contact area as the dominant parameter).
In light of this, crystallization mechanisms were proposed for compounds 1–7 in order to evaluate the changes caused in packing
by different substituents.

The proposed crystallization mechanism
for compound 1 is represented by the formation of two
main stages (Figure 6). In stage I, a two-dimensional
(2D) portion is formed, which involves 6 dimers from the cluster.
The most energetic dimers in this portion are very similar. This portion
is formed by interconnected chains with dimers M1···M3/M4,
which are mainly directed by the NH···O=C interactions
(type I interaction), with energy NG = 2.53. The interactions between
the chains are mainly maintained by a strong dimer M1···M2
with a NG = 2.70. Additionally, other interactions involving the phenyl
rings are present in dimers M1···MN, in which N = 5, 6, and 7.

Figure 6 Proposed crystallization
mechanism of compound 1.
The shaded area represents the portion in the previous stage. The
arrows in each stage indicate the direction of growth. NCG% = 100 × (ΣNCstage + ΣNGstage)/(2 × MCN).

Stage I has NCG% = 74, i.e.,
74% of
all energetic and topologic contributions of the final crystal in
this stage. This stage can be defined as a “point of no return”
because this stage has enough stability to form the final 3D structure,
rather than return to less complex nuclei. Stage II represents the
approximation of the formed portions (2D) interacting to form the
3D structure. This stage presents dimers with NG below 0.48. By observing
the NG/NC parameter of each stage, it is possible to note that the
stabilization energy is dominant in the first stage (NG/NC = 1.26).
The contact area, i.e., the complementarity between the surfaces of
the 2D portions, is the governing parameter in the second stage (NG/NC
= 0.51).

In order to obtain additional data to contribute with
the proposed
crystallization mechanisms, concentration-dependent 1H
NMR experiments were carried out for all studied compounds. The experiments
for compound 1 are observed in Figure 7. The prominent changes in chemical shifts
for both NH···O=C interactions and those involving
aromatic hydrogens derive from a concentration of 0.031 M. This may
indicate the formation of the 2D block proposed in the crystallization
mechanism from the retrocrystallization approach. The subtle change
in chemical shifts under 0.031 M was not considered relevant enough
to assess the possible formation of other stable portions during crystallization,
such as one-dimensional (1D) chains.

Figure 7 Concentration-dependent 1H
NMR spectra of compound 1 performed in CDCl3, at 298 K.

Compound 3 and the trihalomethylated compounds 4–6 also
presented two stages in their proposed crystallization
mechanisms, which is also the case for compound 1. For
these compounds, the first stage is governed by the formation of the
2D nucleus and stage II is the interaction between these stable layers
through less energetic interactions. The difference in systems 5 and 6 will be in how the layers approach each
other at the final moment of the crystallization process. This change
in interaction in the final step and consequently in crystal packing
is seen in the Supporting Information (Figures
S14 and S15).

The dominant parameters for compounds 3–6 are
similar to that of compound 1, where the first stage
is subtly governed by the energetic parameter with NG/NC = 1.12, 1.08,
1.14, and 1.12. The second stage has the contact area as the dominant
parameter, with NG/NC = 0.62, 0.76, 0.74, and 0.75. The crystallization
mechanisms were also corroborated with the chemical shifts observed
by NMR in the solution (see the Supporting Information, Figures S19–S21).

On the other hand, the crystallization
mechanism proposed for compound 2 is also divided into
two distinct stages (Figure 8) but with a slight difference,
which is the formation of a 1D portion in the first stage. The interactions
between dimers with NG = 3.61 take place in the first stage. This
first stage presents NCG% = 36, indicating
the point of no return of the crystal in forming these chains. Stage
II is the interaction between the chains to form the 3D network. All
remaining dimers (NG < 1.17) are involved in this stage. The dominance
of the parameters follows the same tendency of the other compounds,
where the first stage is governed by energy and subsequent increase
of topology dominance in the second stage. However, in this compound,
stronger dominance of the energetic parameter with a NG/NC = 1.65
can be noted in the first stage.

compound 2.
The shaded area represents the portion in the previous stage. The
arrows in each stage indicate the direction of growth.

Compound 7 was first discussed as
two clusters of
molecules Z and E. The most notable contribution was observed from
type I dimers involving NH···O=C interactions
for both clusters. Nonetheless, the proposed crystallization mechanism
for compound 7 has a notable difference when compared
to compounds 1–6. Instead of forming the first
2D (or 1D) layers with both NH···O=C linking
the chains and interactions involving the aromatic systems, a closed
configuration is observed through the formation of a tetramer. This
tetramer is composed of two monomers in the Z form and two in the
E form that interacts through the NH···O=C interactions.
This tetramer has already been reported as a N-phenylformamide
cocrystal directed by hydrogen-bonding NH···O=C,
although without a supramolecular study.20 Therefore, it is remarkable that this same tetramer is still formed
in solution,22 reinforcing the idea that
this can be treated as the minimum unit, i.e., M1 for this compound.
The stabilization energy of −33.76 kcal mol–1 was obtained for the tetramer (Gtetramer) by theoretical calculations.

Because the tetramer is the
most stable configuration adopted by
molecules of compound 7, it must be considered M1, which
is different from the other compounds in which there were no closed
configurations. Therefore, a different supramolecular cluster was
constructed, i.e., cluster of tetramers (Figure 9). The contact area and stabilization energy
data and their respective normalized values were obtained for the
cluster and are shown in the Supporting Information (Table S5).

Figure 9 Tetramer formed by Z and E conformers of compound 7 considered M1 and their respective supramolecular cluster.
The shaded
area represents tetramer stacking.

The crystallization mechanism proposed for compound 7 has stage I characterized by tetramer formation (Figure 10). The tetramer
has a high
stabilization energy of −33.76 kcal mol–1 because of the strong NH···O=C interactions.

Figure 10 Proposed
crystallization mechanism of compound 7.
The shaded area represents the portion in the previous stage. The
arrows in each stage indicate the direction of growth.

Stage II occurs with parallel displaced stacking
between tetramers,
forming a 1D displaced column. This growth is governed by two stacking
dimers, which are both with NG = 4.33. This stage presents NCG% = 40, revealing the high stability of this
1D portion. The next stage (III) presents interactions between these
columns in perpendicular arrangement involving the aromatic rings
(2D layer) of a set of dimers, with NG = 1.95, 0.61, and 0.60. In
this third stage, the NCG% presented an
additional value of 30% of the total energetic and topologic contribution.
Stage IV represents the interaction between the layers through the
hydrogens of the rings, forming the 3D crystal lattice. All dimers
involved in the final stage present values of NG < 0.77. The NG/NC
stage parameter showed the same behavior as compounds 1–6, which means there is a slight dominance of the stabilization energy
in the first step and the subsequent rise of topological governance
in the other two. This is in agreement with a study previously reported
by our research group, where a series of triazene N-oxides presented the same tendency.17 The concentration-dependent 1H NMR experiments for compound 7 are observed in Figure 11, which shows distinct behavior when compared with
compounds 1–6.

Figure 11 Concentration-dependent 1H
NMR spectra of compound 7 performed in CDCl3 at 298 K.

Prominent changes in
the chemical shifts from the lowest concentrations
(0.008 M), regarding the NH···O=C interactions,
are shown in Figure 11. This behavior corroborates with the initial formation of tetramers
in solution, such as the initial nuclei in the crystallization. The
chemical shifts induced by the aromatic systems start from concentrations
of 0.062 M. This indicates further steps regarding the formation of
the 1D displaced columns proposed in the crystallization mechanism
(stage II) and other interactions between aromatic systems.

The changes observed in the packing of the compounds were also
investigated, regarding the steric effect of the substituents. In
this manner, we propose the use of values obtained by Charton’s
method in the supramolecular scope because it was done at the molecular
level. The steric effects presented by Charton (υ) (Table 1) were correlated
with the effects observed in the approximation of the molecules in
the earlier stages of crystallization. To measure this effect, axes
were constructed in two neighboring molecules (e.g., M1 and MN) linking carbonyl α-carbon and ipso-carbon of the
phenyl ring. Next, the improper angle (θ2) between
these two axes was measured. Then, we conventionalized that molecules
that remained with the substituent on the same side on the chains
have θ2 = 0° and opposite sides θ2 = 180°. The axes for compounds 1, 4, and 5 and the angles θ2 for
all compounds are shown in Table 3.

a Improper torsional angles [M1(Cα–Cipso)–MN(Cα′–Cipso′)]. Torsions were measured using the software Mercury.34 Compound 7 was not considered while
obtaining the axes due to tetramer being different from the other
packages.

This correlation
exhibited a tendency between the evaluated data,
which demonstrates that steric factors may influence the approximation
of the molecules in the formation of the first stage of crystallization
(see the Supporting Information, Figure
S33). Compounds 3 and 4 presented distinct
behavior, showing that steric effects are not dominant over these
substituents (Ph and CF3) and compound 7 presented
a different packing. Subsequently, the improper angle (θ2) was correlated with the volume of the substituents obtained
by the Hirshfeld surface. A similar tendency was as observed and is
shown in the Supporting Information (Figure
S34).

Energy Contribution of Each Type of Interaction
Another
important approach that provides a great deal of information about
the nature of interactions is the analysis of QTAIM. The theory proposed
by Bader35 is based on the topological
analysis of the distribution of electron charge density. Furthermore,
correlations using interatomic distance and topological descriptors
of the electron density at the bond critical point (BCP) can be used
to access the energy properties of hydrogen bonds.36 Our research group has used the fragmentation of GM1···MN by the
electron density (ρ) in the BCPs of the bond paths between the
dimers in order to obtain atom···atom interaction energies.16,17,37,38 Zou et al.39 also showed that there is
a strong correlation between these parameters for hydrogen and halogen
bonds.

Then, using the fragmentation of
the intermolecular interactions, it was possible to verify the strong
influence of the NH···O=C bond in the stabilization
of the tetramer (Figure 12). The existence of conformers allowed packing with two main
interactions of −7.08 kcal mol–1 and two
of −6.55 kcal mol–1 that stabilize this structure.
Additionally, five other interaction paths were observed with lower
interaction energies, which added −6.51 kcal mol–1 to the tetramer stabilization.

(kcal mol–1) using the interaction pathways to the
tetramer formed by compound 7. Cage critical points and
ring critical points were omitted
from the images for better clarity of the data.

This analysis can provide the contribution of each interaction
type to assess the understanding, regarding the differences caused
by the presence of different substituents. Figure 13 shows the percentage of energy contribution
obtained for each cluster separated by the types of interaction observed
by QTAIM analysis. The interactions were manually classified based
on the atoms and their respective pathways. The hydrogen bonds were
divided into NH···O=C, CH···π,
and CH···O/CH···N. Additionally, π···π,
CH···HC, halogen bonds (X interactions), and “others”
(N···N, N···π, O···π,
and O···O) were considered.

Figure 13 Representation of energy
contribution by type of interaction for
compounds 1–7.

The NH···O=C interaction contributes
with
28% of cluster stabilization for compound 7, with an
energy of −7.08 kcal mol–1. Compounds 1, 2, and 4 also have great contribution
of this interaction with values of −5.75 kcal mol–1 (22%), −4.07 kcal mol–1 (17%), and −4.53
kcal mol–1 (23%), respectively. The less pronounced
contribution of NH···O=C interactions is for
compounds 3, 5, and 6: −3.05
kcal mol–1 (10%), −2.63 kcal mol–1 (12%), and −3.33 kcal mol–1 (14%), respectively,
which have direct relation to the size of the substituent.

The
hydrogen bonds classified as CH···O/CH···N
appear significantly with about 25% of the energy contribution to
compounds 1, 2, and 7. In these
same compounds, CH···π type interactions increase
in relation to the increased availability of hydrogens to interact
with π sites (i.e., H, CH3, and C(CH3)3).

Furthermore, structure 3 has about 60%
of CH···π
interactions, as expected by the presence of two aromatic rings in
the structure. These dispersion forces play an important role in the
packing of the compounds, as seen in the crystallization mechanism,
with the formation of only two stages. The total stabilization energy
of organic compounds is increased by the cooperative effect of multiple
CH···π interactions.40 In the structures with halogenated substituents, only compound 4 showed significant CH···π interactions,
with the contribution of 23%. The CH···HC interactions
contributed with 17 and 18% to stabilize the cluster of compounds 1 and 2, respectively. The methyl and tert-butyl substituents favor the occurrence of these weak
interactions, although they have a significant total contribution
to cluster stabilization.

The π···π
interactions appear in compounds 3–5 and 7. In compound 7, the π···π
interactions occur
because of the parallelly displaced tetramers in the cluster, as seen
in its mechanism in Figure 10. Compound 3, in addition to the CH···π
interactions, two π···π interactions with
around −1.30 kcal mol–1 also contribute to
the stabilization of the cluster. For the halogenated compounds, only
the fluorinated and chlorinated compounds have π···π
interactions. The first one presents one interaction that represents
7% of the stabilization. The second has a parallel stacking dimer
with two interactions of −2.17 kcal mol–1 (13%).

Compounds 4–6 had their contributions
involving
halogen interactions fragmented (Figure 14), which is because they represent the biggest
contributions to their respective clusters. For compound 4, which had Z′ = 2, only one molecule is
present due to similarity between clusters. The percentage of contribution
by X···X interactions increases on the order of F <
Cl < Br, i.e., increasing the atomic radius increases the number
of interactions between halogens. The same order was observed for
X···O interactions. The CH···X interactions
have equivalent contribution in 4 and 6 clusters
(both 18%) and increase the contribution in cluster 5 (28%). Finally, the presence of interactions Xσ-hole···π type follows the σ-hole values presented
in the MEP maps of Table S2 wherein compound 4 did not show such interactions, despite the small value
of σ-hole. Halogen interactions play an important role in the
total cluster stabilization of compounds 4−6. However, these interactions are not essential in the first
stage of crystallization.

of halogen interactions
for compounds 4–6. X = F (4A), Cl
(5), or Br (6).

Exploring NH···O=C Interactions in Solution
NMR procedures are of general interest because of their importance
in hydrogen bond studies, especially proteins. The correlation of
hydrogen bond lengths and 1H NMR chemical shifts have proven
that the crystal structure of proteins is preserved in solution.41 In this manner, previous concentration-dependent 1H NMR experiments were used to obtain the association constant
(Kass).11,12 The Kass was obtained for the strong hydrogen bonds
(N–H···O=C) related to the amide group
and is listed in Table 4.

Table 4 Data of Kass Constants
for Compounds 1–7
compounds	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	
Kass(N–H···O=C) (mol L–1)	4.25	2.23	0.67	0.76	0.51	0.33	4.58	
Analysis of the Kass values for all
compounds suggests that as the size of substituent increases, the Kass value decreases. The steric hindrance previously
correlated with Charton’s steric effects may hinder to approach
the molecules (see the Supporting Information, Figure S35). The Kass results are in
agreement with results reported by Hunter et al.11,12 because the first aggregates formed in solution are similar to the
arrangements found in the crystal.

The association constant
(Kass(N–H···O=C)) was correlated with the hydrogen interaction energy (GNH···O=C), obtained by the fragmentation
of the dimer energy, as previously demonstrated (Figure 13). To the best of our knowledge,
no correlation between the strength of the hydrogen interaction (from
the crystal) with the Kass in solution
has been reported in the literature. The good correlation found for
compounds 1–7 (GNH···O=C = −0.7941Kass – 2.8364; r = 0.91) is shown in Figure 15. This indicates a direct relation strength
of interactions in solution and the stabilization energy of the interactions
in the crystal lattice. Therefore, with this data, it is possible
to obtain, by either methods, information on the strength of the hydrogen
bonds in these systems. Additionally, this approach can be used in
the field of supramolecular chemistry to assist in the understanding
of molecular self-assembly.

compounds 1–7.

Conclusions
The effect of the substituent on a series
of N-phenylamides 1–7 leads to
some changes in both
the strength of the hydrogen bond energy and crystal packing. The
proposed crystallization mechanisms for the compounds were divided
into two types, which are two stages (1–6) and
stacking of tetramers (7). Compound 2 presented
the formation of a 1D portion (chains) in the first stage, where 1 and 3–6 showed the formation of 2D blocks.
The different approaches of these forms lead to the formation of 3D
structures. Compound 7 presented tetramers in both solution
and solid state which were elucidated by the proposed crystallization
mechanism. The concentration-dependent 1H NMR experiments
corroborated the stages proposed in the crystallization mechanisms.
The packing of the compounds was evaluated in relation to the steric
effect of the substituents and correlated with the steric parameter
of Charton, thus showing some tendency. The correlation between Kass and G for the NH···O=C
interactions was proposed, and good correlation was observed (r = 0.91). This data suggest that the magnitude of this
interaction can be elucidated through experimental and theoretical
data in the supramolecular environment.

Experimental Section
Synthesis
of N-Phenylamides (1–7)
The N-phenylamides (1–7) were
synthesized to allow the study of the compounds in solution
and obtain the crystal of compound 4. The synthesis was
performed according to acylation reactions described in the literature.42−44 In summary, 1 equiv of aniline was reacted with 1.2 equiv (2 equiv
for compound 7) of the acylating agent, with a base in
the presence of a solvent (when necessary). All compounds were purified
using recrystallization or chromatographic column techniques. The
yields of the isolated products ranged from 21 to 99%. For more details
about synthesis, see the Supporting Information.

X-ray Structure Determination
The structures used in
this study are available in the CSD through the following numbers:
(1) 785065,45 (2) 239624,46 (3) 965773,47 (5) 1314188,48 (6) 747306,49 (7) 682820.20 Crystal structure
parameters of compound 4 are listed in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. Experimental essays for
crystallization of compound 4 failed with the aim to
obtain crystals with good quality for X-ray data collection. Several
crystallization tests were performed using pure polar solvents (methanol
and chloroform) and combinations of these with an apolar solvent (n-hexane) in various proportions. In all cases, colorless
crystals in the form of elongate needles were observed, so in ways
that a fragment of a thicker needle was chosen for data collection.
Starting from the best available sample, data were collected at low
temperature (100 K) because the crystal presented low stability at
room temperature. Preliminary attempts to index the symmetry of the
crystal system reveal to be monoclinic as suggestion with the best
reliability. Therefore, the strategy for data collection was based
on this monoclinic system involving the half of the Ewald sphere.
Attempts to perform the data collection based on an orthorhombic crystal
system resulted fruitless. In this context of analysis—based
on the original diffraction data—was maintained the monoclinic
space group P21 for compound 4, without the possibility of symmetry increase to the orthorhombic
system. In addition, on the basis of the reasonable quality of the
diffraction data and on the observed uncertainty on the x Flack parameter, a final refinement using the Twin instruction was
performed (SHELXL version 2016/6). The initially attributed BASF scaling
factor converges to 0.04439. Diffraction data were collected on the
Bruker D8 Venture Photon 100 diffractometer equipped with a graphite
monochromator Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) was
used for collection, which was controlled at 100 K using an Oxford
Cryosystems Cryostream 800 low temperature unit. The frames were integrated
with Bruker SAINT software package.50 Absorption
effects were corrected using the multiscan method (SADABS).51 The structure was solved by direct methods using
the software package WinGX.52

Theoretical
Calculations
All calculations in this study
were performed using the Gaussian 09 software package.53 DFT calculations were performed in a single
point mode with the ωB97XD/cc-pVDZ theory level.54 The counterpoise method of Boys and Bernardi
was employed to minimize basis set superposition error.55G represents the electronic
energy obtained from the calculations, in kcal mol–1. The stabilization energy for the dimers in the cluster was obtained,
considering the dimers and monomers using the following equation: GM1···MN = GM1+MN – (GM1 + GMN).
The energy of tetramer was obtained using the following equation: Gtetramer = GM1+M2+M3+M4 – (GM1 + GM2 + GM3 + GM4). The fragmentation was obtained correlating Gtetramer and ρ (BCPs). MEP maps were built on the
electron density 0.001 au isosurface with GaussView.56 The Hirshfeld surface was obtained using the CrystalExplorer
software.57

The wave functions used
in the QTAIM analysis were generated at the ωB97XD/cc-pVDZ level
of theory. The QTAIM analyses were performed with the aid of the AIMAll
program package.58 Further information
regarding the QTAIM data is described in the Supporting Information.

Determination of the Association Constant
(Kass)
Determination of the association
constant
was done by 1H NMR dilution experiments by preparing different
dilutions of each compound at known concentrations (1, 0.5, 0.25,
0.125, 0.062, 0.031, 0.015, 0.008, and 0.004 mol L–1). All of the 1H NMR spectra were recorded for each concentration
using a Bruker Avance III 600 MHz [1H at 600.130 MHz in
5 mm sample tubes at 298 K in CDCl3/tetramethylsilane (TMS).
Nonlinear curve fitting software was used to analyze NMR signals.

1H and 13C NMR and Solid-State NMR (SSNMR)
1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a
Bruker Avance III (1H at 600.13 MHz and 13C
at 150.903 MHz) spectrometer in CDCl3/TMS solutions at
298 K. All spectra were acquired in a 5 mm tube at natural abundance.
The SSNMR data were recorded in a Bruker Avance III (600 MHz) in the
Larmor frequency for 13C NMR of 150.903 MHz. The 13C CPMAS spectra were acquired on a 4.0 mm probe at a spinning rate
of 12 kHz. The 1H and 13C 90° pulses were
set to 3.4 and 4.85 μs corresponding to radio frequency (RF)
field strengths of 74 and 50 kHz, respectively. The CPMAS was acquired
using a contact time of 3 ms with 1H and 13C
RF of 72 (70–100% RAMP-CP shape) and 74 kHz, respectively.
During the acquisition, a SPINAL-64 1H decoupling with
a pulse length of 7.25 μs at a RF field strength of 74 kHz was
applied.
