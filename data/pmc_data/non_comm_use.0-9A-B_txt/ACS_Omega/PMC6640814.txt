The aqueous self-assembly of μ-A(BC)nmiktobrush terpolymers
has been studied using
dynamic light scattering and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy.
In this system, the A block is hydrophilic poly(ethylene oxide), “O”,
the B block is hydrophobic poly(methylcaprolactone), “C”,
and the C block is hydrophobic and oleophobic poly(perfluoropropylene
oxide), “F”. Two terpolymers were examined: one with
an average of about two C blocks and two F blocks and another with
an average of about three C blocks and two F blocks. In both cases,
the total molar mass is near 40 kg mol–1, and the
volume fraction of the single O block is greater than 50% of the whole.
Both samples form multicompartment micelle structures with subdivided
solvophobic cores of C and F domains. The morphologies observed are
generally analogous to those previously observed for the self-assembly
of μ-ABC miktoarm star terpolymers, namely,
“raspberry” and “hamburger” micelles;
however, an intriguing multicompartment polymersome morphology with
compartmentalized solvophobic bilayers is also observed. These results
are
interpreted in terms of the relative strengths of the competing interactions
among the three blocks and the solvent and in terms of the constraints
imposed by the miktobrush architecture.

Introduction
AB diblock copolymers
self-assemble into a small set of micellar
morphologies in A-selective solvents, and their synthesis and study
have captivated research interest across various scientific disciplines.1−11 More elaborate micelle structures have also been achieved by increasing
the chemical and architectural complexity of the polymers; model examples
include the solution self-assembly of ABC block terpolymers with two
mutually incompatible and solvophobic blocks, B and C. In a solvent
selective for the A block, ABC block terpolymers can form multicompartment
micelles with solvophobic cores comprising distinct B and C domains.12−25 The arrangement of B and C domains in the core will depend upon
the block connectivity, and thus the architecture of the ABC triblock
terpolymers, and their size and shape will be influenced by the relative
interfacial tensions (and thus chemistry, χ, the Flory–Huggins
interaction parameter, and N, the degree of polymerization)
of chains A, B, and C and their respective interactions with the surrounding
solvent.19,26−29 For example, a mutually immiscible
and linear ABC terpolymer in a solvent selective for A will typically
form concentric B and C cores owing to the block connectivity.30−34 However, an equivalent linear BAC terpolymer may form “raspberry”
micelles with subdivided B and C domains in the core surrounded by
looped A coronal chains.35,36 Multicompartment micelles
with nonconcentric morphologies and individually accessible hydrophobic
cores enable applications that exploit the dual uptake and release
properties of the separate domains.37

Multicompartment micelles with distinct subdivided cores were first
demonstrated by the self-assembly of μ-ABC miktoarm star terpolymers. Because of the mandatory convergence of all
three chains in the miktoarm architecture, the formation
of concentric domains (“onion” micelles) is suppressed,
thereby favoring multicompartment micelles with well-defined and subdivided
solvophobic B and C cores. Furthermore, the ability to tune each block
chemistry and size has enabled a suite of accessible morphologies
from a single polymer architecture.21,37−45 This flexibility is advantageous when tailoring the terpolymer and
thus the solution morphology toward a particular application. We have
recently built upon the architectural design of the previous μ-ABC miktoarm star approach by extending the number of repeat
units of (BC)n chains conjoined to A chains
within the starlike architecture (the aforementioned μ-ABC structures
would be those with n = 1), thus achieving μ-A(BC)n “miktobrush”
terpolymers.46 We adopted a simple synthetic
strategy to access a series of such terpolymers with increasing values
of n and thus a potentially wide compositional range
of μ-A(BC)n polymers from three
end-functionalized polymer building blocks. Because of the high incompatibility
and unusual connectivity of the blocks within the μ-A(BC)n terpolymers, we were interested in exploring
their self-assembly in an aqueous solution and in uncovering the morphological
consequences of this architectural variation. In this report, we describe
the aqueous self-assembly of two members of this family of terpolymers,
with n ≈ 2.5 but with differing composition,
which can be considered analogous to the miktoarm
stars with an average of six arms.

Methods
Materials
μ-A(BC)nmiktobrush terpolymers were synthesized by a reversible
addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) alternating, controlled
radical copolymerization, as described previously.46 Briefly, three end-functionalized polymers were synthesized
and then were combined in the RAFT copolymerizations to give μ-O(CF)nmiktobrush terpolymers:
poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), “O” block (21 kDa) with
a RAFT chain transfer agent (CTA) end group; poly(methylcaprolactone)
(PMCL), “C” macromonomer block (5.3 kDa) with a maleimide
end group; and poly(perfluoropropylene oxide) (PFPO), “F”
macromonomer block (2.6 kDa) with a styrene end group. After the preparation
in a mixed solvent system, the μ-O(CF)n terpolymers were precipitated into a mixture of toluene/hexane
(1:9, v/v) to remove any residual C or F macromonomers. All three
polymer building blocks and μ-O(CF)n terpolymers were characterized using size exclusion chromatography
(SEC) equipped with triple detection (refractive index, ultraviolet,
and multiangle laser light scattering) to determine molar masses (Mn and Mw), dispersity
values (D̵), and purity, as determined by the
presence of any residual macromonomers. All homopolymers used for
the preparation of the miktobrush terpolymers were
further characterized using 1H, 13C, and 19F NMR spectroscopies to determine their composition, molar
mass (MnNMR), and end-group fidelity. The compositions of the homopolymers
were confirmed using elemental analysis (Table S1). In the case of the miktobrush terpolymers,
we relied on the elemental analysis of the two samples in this study
to confirm their composition, given some modest internal inconsistencies
in the 1H NMR spectra, which are likely associated with
some solution aggregation in the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
solvent that limited the accuracy of the integrations (see Figures S1 and S2)—μ-O(C2F2): Calcd C = 53.80%, H = 7.95%, F = 9.19%, N = 0.08%,
S = 0.17%. Found C = 53.61%, H = 7.92%, F = 8.85%, N = 0.14%, S =
0.33%. For the analysis of μ-O(C3F2):
Calcd C = 55.38%, H = 8.14%, F = 8.03%, N = 0.10%, S = 0.23%. Found
C = 54.70%, H = 8.09%, F = 7.64%, N = 0.17%, S = 0.19%. Integer values
for the brush degree of polymerization are used in the article. For
the calculated values based on the experimental elemental analysis,
see Table S2.

Cryo-TEM
Cryo-transmission
electron microscopy (cryo-TEM)
samples were prepared by suspending approximately 100–200 nm
thick menisci on lacey carbon TEM grids, which were then rapidly plunged
into liquid ethane near its melting point (−183 °C) using
an FEI Vitrobot to regulate the humidity and ethane immersion process.
The resulting samples were stored at −196 °C before imaging
using either a JEOL 1210 (120 keV) or an FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit BioTwin
transmission electron microscope, at or near −178 °C.

Dynamic Light Scattering
Samples for dynamic light
scattering (DLS) were prepared by filtering the solutions through
0.45 μm hydrophilic filters into dust-free 0.25 in. diameter
glass tubes. DLS measurements were recorded using a Lexel model 75
Ar+ ion laser (wavelength, λ = 488 nm) and a home-built
goniometer in a temperature-controlled silicon oil bath. The scattered
light intensity was detected using a Brookhaven BI-DS photomultiplier
and was processed using a digital correlator (BI-9000AT). Normalized
intensity autocorrelation functions, g2(τ), were measured at six different scattering angles, at 15°
intervals from 45° to 120° at 25 °C. The normalized
electric field correlation functions, g1(τ), were obtained from the measured intensity correlation
functions using the Siegert relation g2(τ) = 1 + β|g1(τ)|2, where 0 ≤ β ≤ 1 is the coherence factor.
These functions were analyzed using both cumulant and double-exponential
fitting procedures. Cumulant fitting gives information on the micelle
size distribution (mean size and width) for a monomodal distribution.47 The following cumulant expansion was used to
fit the data 1  Here, Γ is the mean decay rate, and
μ2 and μ3 are the second and third
cumulants, respectively. The ratio μ2/Γ2 is a measure of the relative width of the size distribution.
For double-exponential fits, which are utilized for a system exhibiting
two distinct decay modes, the following function was used 2  where A1 and A2 represent the relative
contributions to the
scattered field of the decay rates, Γ1 and Γ2. Using either eq 1 or 2, Γ was determined for different
wavevector values (q = 4πnλ–1 sin(θ/2), where n is the refractive index of the solvent and θ is the scattering
angle). The mean diffusion coefficient D was determined by a linear fit of the mean decay rate
Γ versus q2 with an imposed zero
intercept, where Γ = Dq2. The mean
hydrodynamic radius, Rh, was determined
using the Stokes–Einstein equation (Rh = kBT/6πηD, where kB, T, and η are the Boltzmann constant, absolute temperature, and
solvent viscosity, respectively). Inverse Laplace transformations
of the electric field correlation functions were also performed using
the constrained regularization program REPES to obtain the distribution
of relaxation times, which reflects the size distribution of the micelles.48

Results and Discussion
Here, we
report our findings on two samples of μ-A(BC)nmiktobrush terpolymers:
μ-O(C2F2) and μ-O(C3F2), where O represents the PEO block, C represents the PMCL
block, and F represents the PFPO block.46Figure 1 shows the
chemical structure of the μ-O(CF)n polymers; molecular characterization data are shown in Table 1.

The thin-film hydration technique was utilized to induce the self-assembly
of the terpolymers in an aqueous solution. μ-O(C2F2) and μ-O(C3F2) terpolymers
were dissolved in dichloromethane at a concentration of 10 mg/mL,
and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure to form a thin
film of the terpolymer on the walls of a glass vessel. Filtered (0.45
μm filter) deionized water was added to form a dilute (∼1
wt %) sample, and the mixtures were stirred at room temperature for
extended time periods, as noted below. The solutions were then filtered
(0.45 μm filter) once more to remove any large particles before
DLS or electron microscopy measurements. The analysis of the μ-O(C2F2) solution using DLS after 1 week of gentle stirring
at room temperature showed self-assembled aggregates with a mean hydrodynamic
radius, Rh, of 40 nm with a relatively
low dispersity (μ/Γ2 = 0.15) (see week-1 in Figure 2, top).

Figure 2 DLS size distributions
for 1 wt % aqueous solutions of μ-O(C2F2) terpolymer (top) and μ-O(C3F2) terpolymer
(bottom). Data shown were collected at
a scattering angle of 90° and at a temperature of 25 °C.

The μ-O(C2F2) aggregates showed a broadening
of their size distribution over 10 weeks and an increase in mean size,
which is consistent with some evolution of the morphology.49 As can be seen in Figure 3, from the cryo-TEM analysis of μ-O(C2F2) after 10 weeks, predominantly “hamburger”
micelles were observed. In this geometry, the F blocks form the hamburger
itself, the C blocks form the “buns”, and the O blocks
stabilize the assembly. This structure minimizes the contact between
the water and the fluoropolymer, the pair with the highest interfacial
energy. The hamburger micelles typically showed clearly discernible
central F core domains, which appear darker in cryo-TEM because of
the higher electron density of PFPO relative to that of PMCL. The
PFPO domains varied in both size and distribution, likely owing in
some measure to the variability in the number of F and C chains in
the miktobrush molecules and their respective chain
length disparities. A density mapping procedure (Figure 3b) was applied across the core
of an atypically large hamburger micelle (shown in Figure 3c, chosen for clarity) oriented
roughly perpendicular to the plane of the grid. The intensity map
shows a distribution of electron density consistent with a hamburger-like,
alternating arrangement of C and F domains.

and (c) density map across the center of an enlarged image of a micelle.
Inset shows the structural cartoon of the hamburger micelle with a
possible arrangement of the μ-O(C2F2)
terpolymer.

For the hamburger micelles,
the average PMCL and PFPO domain sizes
were 30 ± 5 and 10 ± 5 nm, respectively (by measuring at
least 50 micelles). The average C domain size is close to the fully
stretched length (FSL) of the 5.3 kDa PMCL chain, which is estimated
to be 32 nm. This result is consistent with the so-called superstrong
segregation limit (SSSL),50,51 whereby the entropic penalty of fully stretching a C chain from
the F domain is overwhelmed by the enthalpic benefit of minimizing
their interfacial interaction. The relatively flat nature of the F
domain surfaces is also characteristic of this competition and has
been observed previously for highly incompatible core domains in earlier
studies of linear ABC and μ-ABC triblock terpolymers.40

The FSL of the 2.5 kDa F chain is 5 nm,
and therefore the measured
average domain size for the hamburger F domains of 10 nm using TEM
strongly suggests a bilayer structure. As both C and F domain sizes
resemble the FSL of the respective chains, we infer that the thermodynamic
incompatibility of the F and C cores overrides any potential constraints
imposed by the new miktobrush architecture for the
μ-O(C2F2) terpolymer. Given the relatively
few numbers of blocks (i.e., one O, two C, and two F chains), this
is reasonable because the chains could behave comparably to the analogous miktoarm star polymers previously explored.

Upon imaging
the same sample after 25 weeks, the majority of the
structures resembled raspberry micelles, with distributions of discrete
F domains (darker in cryo-TEM) interspersed within C domains (lighter
in cryo-TEM), as shown in Figure 4. Some hamburger micelles were also observed, albeit
with lower frequency. The overall size distribution using DLS did
not change appreciably over this time interval, suggesting that the
structure evolved more by intraparticle rearrangements than by the
fission/fusion of distinct micelles.49 The
average size of the F domains is 8 ± 2 nm (by measuring the F
domains of at least 50 micelles, including those in Figure 4). This fits a similar model
as that observed for the hamburger micelles, that is, fully stretched,
back-to-back F chains within a PMCL matrix.

a vitrified 1 wt % solution of the μ-O(C2F2) terpolymer, 25 weeks after self-assembly in
water by thin-film hydration; (b) enlarged cryo-TEM image; and (c)
structural model of a raspberry micelle and possible arrangement of
terpolymer.

We next describe the
aqueous self-assembly behavior of the μ-O(C3F2) terpolymer, with a slightly lower PEO volume
fraction (fPEO = 0.57) and slightly less
PFPO relative to PMCL (Table 1). DLS analysis indicated that this polymer initially associated
to form larger aggregates with an average hydrodynamic radius, Rh = 185 nm, and higher dispersity, μ/Γ2 = 0.28 (Figure 2, bottom). A double exponential fit of the autocorrelation function
was consistent with two distinct populations of aggregates in solution,
with one centered at Rh ≈ 75 nm
and one larger population centered at Rh ≈ 250 nm. Cryo-TEM images were consistent with these DLS
measurements, given the inherent differences between the two techniques
(Figure 5). Remarkably,
the predominant morphology is that of a polymersome or polymeric vesicle.
These images contain some multilamellar polymersomes (MLP), and in
all cases, the bilayers appear to be compartmentalized (Figure 6).

a vitrified 1 wt % aqueous solution of the
μ-O(C3F2) terpolymer, 10 weeks after self-assembly

multilamellar polymersomes.

weeks; (b) density mapping across the perimeter of a polymersome reveals

polymersomes.

The FSL of the μ-O(C3F2) alternating
styrene and maleimide backbone (including the RAFT CTA end group)
can be estimated to be 3.3 nm (assuming a planar zigzag conformation,
where the C–C single bond length is 0.154 nm, the C–C–C
bond angle is 109.5°, the C–S single bond length is 0.180
nm, the C–C–S bond angle is 110°, and the C–S
single bond length in S–C(S)–S is 0.152 nm, with a bond
angle of 125°). These calculations, along with the thickness
of 6 nm estimated from the cryo-TEM images, are consistent with a
bilayer comprising two back-to-back μ-O(C3F2) terpolymers with hydrated O chains residing on either side, protecting
the hydrophobic bilayer from the surrounding water.

To investigate
the distribution of C and F domains in the bilayer,
a density mapping procedure was performed on cryo-TEM images of a
polymersome bilayer, as illustrated in Figure 6a,b. The resulting intensity plot highlights
periodic increases in electron density separated center-to-center
by 12 ± 2 nm. These periodic increases in intensity correlate
with the increases in electron density within the structural domains,
indicating the presence of F domains distributed periodically throughout
the bilayer. Because the F domains are separated by 12 ± 2 nm
and given that the FSL of the C chains is approximately 32 nm, the
C domains are likely forming a continuous matrix around the isolated
F domains, again shielding most of the F domains from the solvated
O chains on the interior and exterior of the polymersome. Because
of the connectivity of the blocks, some F chains must extend to the
surface of the vesicle membrane, suggesting that the F blocks form
channels that traverse the bilayer. However, it is important to note
that it is not possible to infer the spatial arrangement of the F
domains in the plane of the membrane because of the projection of
the cryo-TEM image. In a previous report with miktoarm stars, a nearly hexagonal arrangement of F domains within the
plane of the membrane was observed.42

Summary
We have examined the aqueous self-assembly of μ-O(CF)nmiktobrush terpolymers
using DLS and cryo-TEM. The first terpolymer investigated, μ-O(C2F2) (fPEO = 0.63, fPMCL = 0.28, fPFPO = 0.09), at long incubation times forms hamburger and then raspberry-like
micelles, likely owing to the larger volume fraction of PEO. Within
the hamburger micelles, the PMCL chains form “buns”
around an oblate PFPO disk core, thereby decreasing the interfacial
penalty between the PFPO domain and the solvated PEO blocks. Over
time, this morphology evolves to be more predominantly raspberry-like
micelles with more dispersed F domains shielded from solvated PEO
by PMCL chains. These findings are broadly consistent with previous
research on μ-EOF and μ-EOC miktoarm
star terpolymer systems, where raspberry-like multicompartment micelles
were observed for μ-EOF (2-9-5) (fPEO = 0.59, fPEE = 0.17, fPFPO = 0.22). Although the PEO volume fractions of the
respective blocks are similar, the molar masses and architectures
differ. However, it appears that the miktobrush architecture
does not significantly impact the observed morphology in this case,
which can be attributed to the low number of chains that converge
to form the terpolymer. Moreover, the volume fractions and interaction
between the constituent polymers and the surrounding water exert the
dominant influence on the solution structures. The propensity for
the terpolymers studied to form multicompartment micelles with domains
consisting of fully stretched blocks and flatter interfaces also implies
that the superstrong segregation regime governs the microphase separation
behavior of the B and C core domains, as in previous miktoarm star terpolymer systems containing F blocks.

The solution
structures adopted by the μ-O(C3F2) terpolymer
(fPEO = 0.57, fPMCL = 0.35, fPFPO = 0.08) are multilamellar
vesicles or polymersomes with nanoscopic
periodicity within the bilayer, attributed to dispersed domains of
PFPO within a matrix of PMCL. Again looking at a comparison from a
previous study on miktoarm star systems, μ-EOF
(2-4-2.5) (fPEO = 0.48, fPEE = 0.32, fPFPO = 0.20)
formed nanostructured bilayer sheets and vesicles with cylindrical
F domains distributed approximately hexagonally in a continuous PEE
matrix. The miktobrush architecture does influence
the self-assembled structures in this case. Such multicompartmentalized
nanostructures could have potential as drug delivery vehicles, nanoreactors,
and protocells with tunable membrane permeability and double delivery
capability.
