Silk–elastin block copolymers
have such physical and biological
properties that make them attractive biomaterials for applications
ranging from tissue regeneration to drug delivery. Silk–elastin
block copolymers that only assemble into fibrils at high concentrations
can be used for a template-induced fibril assembly. This can be achieved
by additionally including template-binding blocks that promote high
local concentrations of polymers on the template, leading to a template-induced
fibril assembly. We hypothesize that template-inducible silk-fibril
formation, and hence high critical concentrations for fibril formation,
requires careful tuning of the block lengths, to be close to a critical
set of block lengths that separates fibril forming from nonfibril
forming polymer architectures. Therefore, we explore herein the impact
of tuning block lengths for silk–elastin diblock polypeptides
on fibril formation. For silk–elastin diblocks ESm–SQn, in which the elastin pentamer repeat is ES =
GSGVP and the crystallizable silk octamer repeat is SQ =
GAGAGAGQ, we find that no fibril formation occurs for n = 6 but that the n = 10 and 14 diblocks do show
concentration-dependent fibril formation. For n =
14 diblocks, no effect is observed of the length m (with m = 40, 60, 80) of the amorphous block on
the lengths of the fibrils. In contrast, for the n = 10 diblocks that are closest to the critical boundary for fibril
formation, we find that long amorphous blocks (m =
80) oppose the growth of fibrils at low concentrations, making them
suitable for engineering template-inducible fibril formation.

Introduction
Silk is a naturally occurring biomaterial
with a unique combination
of elasticity and strength approaching the mechanical properties of
materials like Kevlar.1,2 For millennia, humans have repurposed
naturally occurring silk in textiles, and the unique properties of
this material have led to its widespread use as a biomaterial.3 Silk films have been used as wound dressings
to protect against infections,4 silk hydrogels
and sponges and porous microtubes have been used as scaffolds for
the delivery of cells and/or cytokines5−7 and for tissue regeneration,8 and silk capsules have been proven useful for
drug delivery.9,10

Applications of silk proteins
and engineered silklike polypeptides
are to a large extent determined by their unique self-assembly behavior,
which is controlled by an alternation of crystallizable and amorphous
sequence motifs. In early studies on the structure–property
relationship of silklike polymers, Tirrell and co-workers synthesized
and studied polypeptides with the general sequence [(AG)xEG]n inspired by the
crystallizable blocks of Bombyx mori silks. Next, by mimicking the
alternation of crystallizable and amorphous blocks of natural silks,
various groups have developed block copolymers with both crystallizable
and amorphous blocks. In particular, silk–elastin-like polypeptides
(ELPs)11,12 have been developed that are composed of
multiple crystallizable silklike blocks, such as (GAGAGS)n and amorphous elastin-like (GXGVP)m blocks, where X is the so-called guest residue in the consensus
motif for elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs). Another type of amorphous
block that has been explored extensively for use in silk-block copolymers13−18 is a collagen-like polypeptide (GXaaYaa)m with the Xaa and Yaa residues chosen to be mostly uncharged and
hydrophilic such that these blocks adopt random coils rather than
triple helical configurations.19

Silklike polymers often assemble into fibrils and for many applications,
such as the encapsulation of therapeutic nucleic acids, it would be
advantageous if silk-fibril formation could be engineered to be induced
by specific templates. Ideally, the template-induced fibrils can be
easily separated from self-assembled fibrils that do not harbor the
template. One approach is to use a low concentration of silklike polymers
that only self-assemble into fibrils at high concentrations and to
locally concentrate them on the template. This approach, of driving
fibril formation by a change in concentration, has been realized for
the specific case of the viruslike encapsulation of single-DNA molecules,
using a silklike polymer endowed with a K12 oligolysine
DNA binding domain.20 For the triblock
copolymer (GXaaYaa)132–(GAGAGAGQ)10–K12, it was shown that in the absence of a DNA template it only
forms fibrils at high concentrations (above 80 μM). However,
already at much lower concentrations, when mixed with DNA, the triblock
spontaneously forms rod-shaped viruslike particles, each encapsulating
a single DNA molecule, with a core formed by a silk fibril.

An outstanding question that remains, and one that we attempt to
answer in this study for silk–elastin diblocks, is what the
requirements are on the lengths of both the silk and elastin block
to arrive at silk polymers for which assembly can be induced by an
external template. More specifically, we aim at silk polymers that
only assemble into long fibrils at rather high concentrations, which
is a situation that could be created locally by the accumulation of
the silk polymers onto the template via a template-binding domain.
With this in mind, we study the concentration-dependent fibril formation
of silk–elastin-like diblock polypeptides (GSGVP)m–(GAGAGAGQ)n for
a range of values of the block lengths n and m.

Results
Polypeptide Production
To study the effect of block
lengths on the self-assembly behavior of silk–elastin diblocks,
genes for a set of diblock polypeptides (GSGVP)m–(GAGAGAGQ)n were prepared
using the PRe-RDL strategy, as described previously.21 Herein, we use the nomenclature ES = GSGVP for
the elastin pentamer motif and SQ = GAGAGAGQ for the silk
motif; diblock sequences are abbreviated as ESm–SQn. Genes were prepared for diblocks with m = 40,
60, or 80 ES pentamer repeats and n =
6, 10, or 14 SQ silk repeats. The final PRe-RDL step of
combining genes for silk and elastin blocks to form genes for diblocks
is illustrated in Figure 1, together with a depiction of polypeptide architecture. We
depict the silk block in Figure 1 as a β-solenoid configuration since this is
the configuration that S10Q silk blocks were
shown to adopt in fibrils in recent atomistic molecular dynamics simulations.22 Fibrils are formed by β-solenoids stacking
on top of each other. Stacking is thought to be driven by the formation
of multiple hydrogen bonds.22 It has been
described before that the elastin pentamers within silk–elastin
multiblock copolymers may increase the rate of fibril formation when
used at temperatures above the transition temperature (Tt) of the elastin blocks.23 Note, however, that we here use a very hydrophilic ES elastin pentamer motif, resulting in silk–elastin polypeptides
with very high Tt , such that not
thermal transitions but only accumulation to high concentrations on
the template will drive fibril formation.

Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE)
for the E80S–S10Q diblock after purification is shown in Figure 2a and is representative for the other silk–elastin
diblock copolymers used herein. All polypeptides showed high purity,
as confirmed by spectrophotometry via the absence of any absorption
at 280 nm but a high absorption at 230 nm. Note that for SDS-PAGE,
silk–elastin diblocks stain rather poorly by the coomassie-based
PageBlue staining. Similarly, poor results in terms of staining were
obtained using copper chloride. Also, as observed for many nonglobular
protein-based polymers with poor SDS binding,19,20,24−26 the diblocks have anomalous
electrophoretic mobility as compared with typically used molecular
weight markers such that we cannot directly estimate molar masses
on the basis of the SDS-PAGE by comparing with molecular weight markers.
Precise molar masses were obtained from matrix-assisted laser desorption
ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). An example
spectrum for the selected diblocks is shown in Figure 2b, and experimental molar masses (as well
as yields) for all diblocks are given in Table 1. Assuming full removal of N-terminal methionines,27 experimentally determined masses agree with
the expected ones within the experimental error.

Dependence of Self-Assembly
of Silk–Elastin Diblocks
on Block Lengths
We used atomic force microscopy (AFM) and
cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) imaging to explore
at which block lengths the self-assembly of silk–elastin diblocks
could be driven by accumulation onto a template. Solutions of ESm–SQn diblocks with m = 40 or 80
and n = 6, 10, or 14 were prepared from purified
polypeptide powders and incubated at room temperature for 24 h (for
AFM) or 16 h (for cryo-TEM) to allow for their self-assembly into
fibrils. Both these assembly times are long enough for fibrils to
reach their terminal lengths, on the basis of the assembly times for
very similar silk-block-containing polymers that we have studied before.20

In our previous studies on silk fibril
templating on DNA by the (GXaaYaa)132–(GAGAGAGQ)10–K12 triblock copolymer, we found that
the templated fibril assembly already occurred at a low concentration
of 1.8 μM. In the absence of a template, however, fibrils were
only found at concentrations above 80 μM.20 Here, we study the assembly of the silk–elastin
diblocks at these same two concentrations, with the goal of identifying
optimal block lengths for a templated self-assembly: those for which
the polypeptides form no or only very short fibrils at the low concentration
but do form fibrils at the high concentration. This would mimic the
situation of a dilute polypeptide solution in which the polypeptides
only form fibrils upon accumulation onto a template. Results for AFM
and cryo-TEM imaging are shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Dependence of the self-assembly of ESm–SQn diblocks
on silk and elastin block lengths. For AFM, silk–elastin diblocks
were incubated for 24 h, then subsequently adsorbed on silicon substrates
and imaged under dry conditions. Polypeptide solutions were prepared
at a low concentration of 1.8 μM (left column) and a high concentration
of 100 μM (middle column). For cryo-TEM, diblocks were prepared
at 100 μM and incubated for 16 h (right column). The black arrows
indicate the lacey carbon grid, and silk-block copolymer fibrils are
indicated by the black arrowheads. (a) E80S–S6Q, (b) E80S–S10Q, (c) E80S–S14Q, (d) E40S–S10Q, and (e) E40S–S14Q.

We first examined the dependence of the self-assembly on
the length
of the silk block with the elastin block fixed at m = 80. We find that a silk-block length of n = 6
is not enough to allow for fibril formation at either the low or high
concentration that we have used in our experiments (see Figure 3a). For silk-block lengths
of n = 10 and 14 (Figure 3b,c), we find concentration-dependent fibril
formation: at a polypeptide concentration of 1.8 μM, both diblocks
self-assemble into relatively short fibrils (left column), whereas
at a high concentration of 100 μM, they self-assemble into very
long fibrils (middle column).

Next, we examined the influence
of the length m of the amorphous elastin blocks on
the fibril formation by the ESm–SQn silk–elastin
diblocks. As none of the
polypeptides with n = 6 were able to form fibrils
at high concentration, which is a requirement for template-induced
fibril formation, this case is not further discussed here. We compare
the n = 10 or 14 diblocks for lengths m of the amorphous block of m = 40 and 80 (E40S–S10Q vs E80S–S10Q and E40S–S14Q vs E80S–S14Q; Figure 3b,d and c,e). At high concentrations, all
fibrils for the diblocks with n = 10, 14 are very
long irrespective of the length m of the amorphous
block (Figure 3, middle
column). This is an important feature that will allow assembly into
fibrils upon accumulation onto a template. At low concentration, it
appears that the fibrils become shorter as the length of the amorphous
block increases from m = 40 to 80; ascertaining this
requires a more quantitative analysis that we perform below. To exclude
the possibility that the AFM sample preparation procedure somehow
affects our observations on fibril growth, we also used cryo-TEM to
visualize fibrils in solution, at a polypeptide concentration of 100
μM. Representative micrographs for a silk-block length of n = 10 and amorphous block lengths of m = 40, 80 are shown in Figure 3d,b, respectively (right column). As observed using AFM for
the same conditions, long fibrils are formed for both cases (indicated
by black arrowheads).

Quantitative Analysis of Fibril Lengths
For a template-induced
assembly, it is desirable that the fibrils formed at low polypeptide
concentration are as short as possible so that self-assembled fibrils
are easily distinguished and or separated from template-induced fibrils.
We, therefore, quantitatively characterize the subtle differences
in the assembly of the diblocks into fibrils at the low concentrations
of 1.8 μM for the diblocks with n = 10 or 14
and varying lengths of m. Fibril lengths for these
diblocks were determined from AFM images, and the histograms are shown
in Figure 4. The distributions
are very broad, with many short fibrils and a smaller number of longer
fibrils. Despite their lower number, the longer fibrils represent
a significant fraction of the total polypeptide mass. Therefore, the
length distributions are given as the fraction of total polypeptide
mass (weight fraction) versus fibril length. In view of the broad
distributions, we give both the number-averaged fibril lengths ⟨L⟩n and the weight-averaged
fibril lengths ⟨L⟩w for the silk–elastin diblocks in Table 2. Finally, Figure 5 shows the number-averaged fibril lengths
⟨L⟩n for
all diblocks with silk-block lengths n = 10 and 14.

Fibril lengths were determined from AFM images of diblocks incubated
at 1.8 μM for 24 h. Weight fractions of each binned length category
were calculated with the assumption that the polypeptide mass of a
given fibril is proportional to the fibril length. (a) E80S–S10Q, (b) E80S–S14Q, (c) E40S–S10Q, and (d) E40S–S14Q. For each polypeptide

also shown in the plots.

b Number- and weight-averaged fibril
lengths (±standard error of the mean (SEM)) were calculated using
the data obtained from AFM images.

First, we examined the effect of the silk-block length n on fibril lengths by comparing the fibril length distributions
for diblocks with a fixed length of the amorphous block (m = 40 or 80), for silk-block lengths of n = 10 and
14 (Figure 4a vs b
and c vs d). For n = 14, the tails of the distributions
stretch to much larger lengths as compared with the distribution for n = 10, leading to higher weight-averaged fibril lengths
(⟨L⟩w =
185 ± 44.8 nm for E80S–S14Q, as opposed to ⟨L⟩w = 67 ± 9.0 nm for E80S–S10Q, and ⟨L⟩w = 168 ± 41.6 nm for E40S–S14Q, as opposed
to ⟨L⟩w = 129 ± 16.0 nm for E40S–S10Q; see Table 2 and Figure 4). This shows that at the low concentration of 1.8 μM,
the self-assembly is sensitive to the precise length of the silk block,
with the shorter silk-block length n = 10 resulting
in shorter fibrils.

Next, we examined the effect of the length m of
the amorphous elastin block by comparing the fibril length distributions
for diblocks with a fixed silk-block length n = 10
or 14 and a varying length m of the elastin-like
blocks (Figure 4a vs
c and b vs d). For diblocks with silk-block length n = 10, the histograms of Figure 4 (Figure 4a vs c) corroborate the qualitative observation that fibrils become
shorter as the length of the amorphous block increases from m = 40 to 80: fibrils formed by m = 80
diblocks are significantly shorter than fibrils formed by the m = 40 diblocks at the same concentration (⟨L⟩w = 67 ± 9 nm
vs ⟨L⟩w = 129 ± 16 nm, respectively). This shows that for n = 10, the elastin blocks are able to modulate assembly of the silk
blocks in such a way that longer elastin blocks lead to shorter fibrils
at low polypeptide concentrations. In contrast, the histograms and
weight-averaged fibril lengths (⟨L⟩w) for diblocks with a silk-block length of n = 14 (Figure 4b vs d) are rather similar to each other and are less affected
by the elastin block length m.

The influence
of the length m of the amorphous
block for a silk-block length of n = 10 on the fibril
lengths at low concentrations is even more evident from Figure 5, which shows plots of the
weight-averaged fibril lengths ⟨L⟩w for n = 10 and 14 as a
function of m (Figure 5). To better evaluate the trend in fibril lengths with
varying lengths m of the amorphous block, we here
also provide the average fibril lengths for diblocks with m = 60 in addition to those with m = 40
or 80. For the n = 10 diblock fibril lengths clearly
decrease when the length m of the amorphous block
increases, whereas for n = 14, there is no clear
trend.

Discussion
Block lengths and block
length ratios are one of the key parameters
of protein-based block copolymers governing their self-assembly, coassembly
with a template, and other functionalities.11,20,28−30 The synergy between
ordered and amorphous polypeptide domains has similarly been shown
to heavily influence the resulting material properties of protein-based
materials.31 In the case of silklike protein-based
polymers, this means that the amorphous blocks influence the molecular
interactions of the crystallizable blocks and vice versa. By precisely
tuning the lengths of the amorphous and crystallizable blocks, it
will be possible to develop silklike polymers for which assembly into
fibrils is induced by an external template. Such a template-induced
assembly may be advantageous for various applications, for example,
the encapsulation of a therapeutic nucleic acid template for gene
therapy purposes. The diblocks used here are an excellent model system
to study the mutual influence of amorphous and crystallizable blocks
in these polymers and were therefore used here to explore how the
block lengths can be optimized for a template-induced assembly.

A template-induced assembly requires that the polypeptides do not
self-assemble into fibrils at low polypeptide concentrations (i.e.,
the normal working concentration), whereas at high polypeptide concentrations
(which resembles the accumulation of polypeptide onto a template),
they should form fibrils. For ESm–SQn silk–elastin
diblock polypeptides, we have shown herein that a minimal length of
the crystallizable silk block is required to drive fibril formation
at these high polypeptide concentrations. We established that for
amorphous block lengths m ≥ 40, n = 6 is insufficient whereas n ≥ 10 is sufficient
for fibril formation. Next, we have shown that these ESm–SQn silk–elastin diblock polypeptides with n ≥ 10 also form fibrils at low concentrations. Only for some
cases we find that the length of these fibrils can be controlled by
the length m of the amorphous blocks. Specifically,
it appears that the diblocks with block lengths n that are closest to the boundary for fibril formation (n = 10) respond most strongly to the length of the amorphous block,
with longer amorphous blocks leading to shorter fibrils at low concentrations,
suggesting that the amorphous blocks in that case can effectively
oppose fibril growth. For longer silk blocks (n =
14), the driving force for fibril growth is apparently already too
large to be opposed by the amorphous blocks, since in that case we
do not find a significant dependence of fibril growth on the length
of the amorphous blocks. Our report of continuous tuning of fibril
growth by adjusting the length of the amorphous blocks is new but
also consistent with our previous report on “on/off”
switching of fibril formation via amorphous blocks: triblocks (GXaaYaa)67–(GAGAGAGH)n–(GXaaYaa)67 with n = 16 do not form fibrils in the
presence of the amorphous blocks, but when the latter are proteolytically
shortened, fibrils are formed.24

For diblocks such as E80S–S10Q, which form only very short fibrils at low concentrations
but very long fibrils at high concentrations, template-induced assembly
may be realized by adding a template-binding block, for example, a
positively charged block to bind negatively charged (nucleic acid)
templates.20 The binding blocks may of
course influence the self-assembly behavior of the silk–elastin
part to some extent, but this could then be compensated for by rational
tuning of the block lengths in the triblock designs.

In summary,
we examined the interplay between crystallizable and
amorphous blocks in ESm–SQn silk–elastin diblock
polypeptides. We find that for diblocks with lengths of crystallizable
blocks just over the threshold for fibril formation, the amorphous
block acts as a break on fibril growth at low concentrations, with
longer amorphous blocks leading to shorter fibrils. Since template-inducible
silk fibril formation requires that fibril formation only occurs at
high concentrations, we conclude that for engineering (template)-inducible
silk fibril formation of ESm–SQn silk–elastin
diblock polypeptides, suitable block lengths are most likely those
with crystallizable block lengths n as close to the
threshold for fibril formation as possible. At such critical silk-block
lengths n, the amorphous block length m can be used for fine-tuning the assembly behavior. In combination
with suitable template-binding blocks, such diblocks allow for nucleic
acid encapsulation in silk fibrils,20 and,
for example, may also allow for engineering-induced silk fibril formation
on the surfaces of biomaterials, which has also been explored for
other silks.32−34

was previously modified for PRe-RDL
(recursive directional ligation by plasmid reconstruction) cloning.21 PRe-RDL vectors containing the genes encoding
ESm = (GSGVP)m (with m = 40, 60, and 80) were developed
previously.35 Custom oligonucleotides for
the construction of the silk blocks SnQ = (GAGAGAGQ)n were synthesized
by Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. Restriction enzymes, calf-intestinal
phosphatase (CIP), and Quick Ligation kit were ordered from New England
Biolabs, and T4 DNA ligase buffer was purchased from Invitrogen. The
DNA miniprep, gel purification, and PCR purification kits were purchased
from Qiagen Inc. Chemically competent Escherichia coli cells (EB5Alpha and BL21 (DE3)) were purchased from EdgeBioSystems,
and the TBdry growth media was purchased from MO BIO Laboratories
Inc. The 4–20% Ready Gel Tris–HCl precast gels and Precision
Plus Protein Kaleidoscope Prestained Protein Standard were purchased
from BioRad.

Concatemerization of the Silklike Repeat
To construct
vectors carrying the silklike repeat SnQ (with n = 6, 10, or 14), two complementary
custom oligonucleotides were designed. They encode two repeats of
the silklike sequence, S2Q = (GAGAGAGQ)2: 5′-cGCTGGTGCTGGTGCTGGTCAAGGAGCCGGTGCTGGAGCCGGCCAAgg-3′
and 5′-TTGGCCGGCTCCAGCACCGGCTCCTTGACCAGCACCAGCACCAGCgcc-3′.
The two oligonucleotides were 5′ phosphorylated to allow efficient
ligation into the vector. They were annealed at a concentration of
2 μM in T4 DNA ligase buffer by heating to 95 °C for 2
min followed by slowly cooling the solution to room temperature over
3 h. The pET24a(+) PRe-RDL cloning vector was linearized by digesting
approximately 2 μg of the vector with 5 U of BseRI for 2 h at
37 °C, followed by dephosphorylation of the 5′ ends with
10 U of CIP for 30 min at 37 °C. The linearized vector was purified
using a PCR purification kit before ligation with the annealed oligonucleotides.
Ligation and concatemerization was conducted by incubation of an excess
amount of the annealed oligonucleotides with the vector at room temperature
for 5 min in the presence of Quick ligase and 1× Quick ligase
buffer. Due to the design of the oligonucleotides, multiple copies
of the S2Q-annealed oligonucleotides can sequentially
ligate into the vector, thereby creating sequences that encode amongst
others S6Q, S10Q, and
S14Q. Finally, the ligation products were transformed
into EB5Alpha E. coli chemically competent
cells and the cells were plated on TBdry-Agar plates supplemented
with 45 μg/mL kanamycin. Colony PCR was performed to select
those colonies that contained plasmids with one or more copies of
the sequence encoding the silklike repeat S2Q, and identity of the plasmids was confirmed by DNA sequencing.

Gene Construction by PRe-RDL
To construct genes encoding
for a set of ESm–SQn diblock polypeptides with various
lengths of the ELP and silklike blocks, we used the PRe-RDL approach
previously developed.21 The pET24a(+) PRe-RDL
cloning vectors containing genes for various numbers of the ELP repeat
(EmS, where m is 40, 60, or 80) were previously developed.35 They were digested for 3 h at 37 °C using BglI and
AcuI enzymes. BglI × AcuI fragments containing the EmS genes, the so-called A-fragments, were
purified using gel electrophoresis by separating the digestion products
on a 1% agarose gel. To obtain the B-fragments, vectors containing
the genes for a number of repeats of the silklike sequence (SnQ, where n is
6, 10, or 14) were digested in 3 h at 37 °C using BglI and BseRI
enzymes and the fragments containing the genes for the SnQ sequences were again purified by gel
purification. Genes for ESm–SQn diblocks were
then constructed by ligation of the A- and B-fragments using Quick
ligase for 5 min at room temperature in a 1× Quick ligase buffer.
The ligation products were transformed into E. coli EB5Alpha chemically competent cells, and the cells were plated on
TBdry-Agar plates supplemented with 45 μg/mL kanamycin. All
sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing.

Polypeptide Expression
Between 100 and 150 ng of the
plasmids encoding the ESm–SQn diblocks were transformed into
BL21(DE3) E. coli chemically competent
cells. These cells were used to inoculate starter cultures of 10 mL
of TB medium supplemented with 45 μg/mL kanamycin. Starter cultures
were incubated at 37 °C overnight on a shaker at 200 rpm and
used to inoculate cultures of 2 L TB medium with 45 μg/mL kanamycin.
Cells were grown at 37 °C on a shaker at 200 rpm for a total
of 24 h. Polypeptide expression was induced in these cells 8 h after
inoculation by supplying isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside
at a final concentration of 1 mM to the medium.

Polypeptide
Purification
After 24 h, cells were centrifuged
at 3000 × g for 10 min at 10 °C and the
pellet was resuspended in 25 mL of cold phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS). The cells were lysed on ice by 18 sonication cycles of 10 s
with 40 s intervals (Sonicator 3000, Misonix). Inclusion bodies were
pelleted by centrifugation at 29 000 × g for 12 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant (soluble lysate), containing
the polypeptide, was collected. Next, nucleic acids were removed by
mixing the soluble lysate with 4 mL of 10% polyethylenimine and centrifugating
at 29 000 × g for 12 min at 4 °C.
Polypeptides in the remaining supernatant (cleared lysate) were further
purified using inverse transition cycling (ITC).36,37 During each round of ITC, polypeptides are subjected to the following
four steps: (1) addition of 1.0–2.5 M ammonium sulfate or sodium
chloride to lower the transition of the ELP-containing polypeptides.
(2) Incubation at 37 °C for 15 min to induce phase separation
of the ELP-containing polypeptides, and precipitation of the ELP-containing
polypeptides by centrifugation at 40 °C for 12 min at 29 000
× g. (3) Resuspension in cold PBS to solubilize
the ELP-containing polypeptides. (4) Removal of any remaining insoluble
matter by centrifugation at 4 °C for 12 min at 29 000
× g. ESm–SQn polypeptides were
purified by multiple rounds of ITC, but it was found that this did
not lead to the desired level of purity of the polypeptides. To further
increase purity, we also used a “bake-out” procedure:
samples were incubated at 95 °C for 15 min to induce denaturation
of any remaining cellular proteins. Next, the samples were cooled
down on ice for 30 min to ensure that the ELP-containing polypeptides
dissolved, and finally, the remaining denatured cellular proteins
were removed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 12 min at 29 000
× g. A bake-out only was found to be insufficient
for polypeptide purification (as determined spectroscopically and
with SDS-PAGE) so that this procedure was always combined with several
rounds or ITC. For the EmS–S10Q polypeptides, three rounds of ITC were used,
followed by a bake-out. For the ESm–S6Q polypeptides, three rounds of ITC
were used with a bake-out after the 1st and 2nd rounds of ITC. Finally,
for the EmS–S14Q polypeptides, bake-out was integrated in the ITC: after
centrifugation of aggregated ELP-containing polypeptides (ITC step
2), the pellet was resuspended and solubilized in PBS by incubation
for 15 min at 95 °C (step 3). To remove denatured proteins and
other insoluble matter, the sample was cooled down on ice for 30 min
and centrifuged at 4 °C for 12 min at 29 000 × g (step 4). Two rounds of ITC including bake-out were performed
to purify the EmS–S14Q polypeptides. Finally, all polypeptides were
dialyzed against Milli-Q water, lyophilized, and stored at room temperature.

Polypeptide Characterization
Polypeptide purity was
assessed with SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE was carried out using 4–20%
Ready Gel Tris–HCl precast gels, 1× Laemmli running buffer,
and Precision Plus Protein Kaleidoscope Prestained Protein Standard.
Gels were stained with PageBlue. To confirm the molecular weight of
the polypeptides, we used matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization
time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). MALDI-TOF MS was
carried out on an UltrafleXtreme mass spectrometer (Bruker). Weighed
portions of freeze-dried polypeptides were mixed with the matrix to
a final concentration of 0.3 mg/mL and dried on the 800 μm spots
of an MTP AnchorChip 384 target (Bruker). After mixing, final concentrations
of the matrix components were 5 mg/mL 2.5-dihydroxyacetophenone, 1.5
mg/mL di-ammonium hydrogen citrate, 25% (v/v) ethanol, and 1% (v/v)
trifluoroacetic acid.

In addition to SDS-PAGE, polypeptide purity
was monitored during purification by spectrophotometry using a Thermo
Scientific NanoDrop spectrophotometer. After each round of ITC and/or
bake-out, 2 μL of the sample was applied onto the NanoDrop to
record the 220–350 nm spectra. For pure samples, no absorbance
at 280 nm is observed as the silk–elastin diblocks do not contain
any amino acid that absorbs at this wavelength, viz., tryptophan,
tyrosine, and cysteine. The presence of the silk–elastin diblocks
in these pure samples is confirmed by high absorbance at 230 nm, which
is caused by the peptide bonds. Nonpure samples are characterized
by absorbance at 230 and 280 nm, due to the presence of the above-mentioned
amino acids in natural (bacterial) proteins.

Polypeptide Self-Assembly
For atomic force microscopy
experiments, polypeptide stock solutions of 100 μM were prepared
by vortexing weighed portions of freeze-dried polypeptides in 10 mM
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 95 °C for 10 min. Solutions at lower
concentrations were prepared by immediately diluting the 100 μM
polypeptide solutions in 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Next, samples
were incubated at room temperature for 24 h to allow self-assembly
of the silk–elastin fibrils. For cryo-TEM, weighed portions
of freeze-dried E40S–S10Q and E80S–S10Q polypeptides were solubilized in PBS to a concentration of
100 μM by a combination of vortexing and heating to 65 °C
for 15 min. Solubilized polypeptides were incubated for 16 h at room
temperature to allow for the assembly of the silk–elastin fibrils.

Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)
Samples for AFM imaging
were prepared by depositing 5 μL of 24 h incubated polypeptide
solutions onto clean silicon surfaces. Salts and nonabsorbed particles
were removed after 2 min by rinsing the surfaces with 1 mL of Milli-Q
water. Surfaces were slowly dried under a N2 stream. Samples
were analyzed in air in the ScanAsyst (PeakForce Tapping) imaging
mode on a NanoScope MultiMode 8 system (Bruker) using ScanAsyst-Air
cantilevers (Bruker). The scan area was set to 5 × 5 μm2, and images were recorded at 512 × 512 pixels and a
line rate of 0.977 Hz. A second-order flattening was performed on
all images using NanoScope Analysis 1.40 software. Lengths of the
self-assembled silk–elastin fibrils were measured using FiberApp
software38 with settings: α = 0,
β = 500, γ = 20, κ1 = 20, κ2 = 10, step =
1 pixel, and iterations = 100, “Use A* pathfinding algorithm”.
Lengths obtained with FiberApp software were binned to obtain length
distributions and to calculate the number and weight averages of lengths
of the self-assembled silk–elastin fibrils (assuming fibril
mass is proportional to fibril length). The standard error of the
mean for the weight averages was estimated using the method of block
averages: fibril length observations were split into 5 blocks, and
the standard error of the mean was taken to be the standard deviation
of the weight-averaged fibril lengths for the 5 blocks.

Cryogenic Transmission
Electron Microscopy (cryo-TEM)
Solutions containing 100 μM
E40S–S10Q or E80S–S10Q and incubated
for 16 h at room temperature were prepared
for cryo-TEM. The cryo-TEM measurements were performed at Duke University’s
Shared Materials Instrumentation Facility. First, lacey holey carbon
grids (Ted Pella) were cleaned in a PELCO EasiGlow cleaning system
(Ted Pella). For each sample, 3 μL was deposited onto a grid.
Samples were then vitrified using a FEI Vitrobot Mark III by blotting
the sample for 3 s with an offset of −3 mm and vitrifying it
in liquid ethane. To prevent sample evaporation prior to vitrification,
the sample chamber was kept at 22 °C and 100% humidity. Finally,
the prepared grids were placed into a Gatan 626 cryoholder and imaged
on a FEI Tecnai G2 Twin.
