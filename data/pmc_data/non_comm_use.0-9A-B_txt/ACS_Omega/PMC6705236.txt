The interaction parameters between
two components need to be first
determined to obtain the thermophysical properties of the binary mixtures.
In this paper, the research progresses of the binary interaction parameter
for CO2 and hydrocarbons (HCs) and their related mixtures
are illustrated. Aiming at the physical property prediction of CO2/alkanes (C1–C10) binary mixtures
in pseudocritical regions, the experimental data of CO2/alkanes (C1–C10) in the pseudocritical
region available in the open literature are collected. Besides, the
calculation of kij is
carried out by five typically accepted correlations selected from
the literature. The effects of temperature, pressure, carbon number,
and acentric factor on kij are investigated. By researching the influence of the above five
factors on kij, it reveals
that temperature is the most important one. Considering the influence
of the critical temperatures of mixtures, a simple correlation is
proposed to evaluate kij for light HC mixtures in the pseudocritical region.

1 Introduction
In recent years, more and more environmental problems such as global
warming, ozone depletion, and atmospheric pollution have been caused
by the increasing consumption of fossil fuels. As for energy production,
low-grade waste heat with the advantage in reducing fossil fuel consumption
has attracted more and more attention. The transcritical Rankine cycle
is a kind of advanced mid-low grade heat/power conversion technology
with some outstanding characters, such as small volume, high efficiency,
and environmental friendliness.

Natural fluids such as carbon
dioxide (CO2) and hydrocarbons
(HCs) have many advantages as working fluids for power cycles.1 CO2 is a kind of waste product in
many industry processes, which is an environmentally friendly, safe,
and cheap working fluid. Meanwhile, HCs with a low GWP and ODP = 0,
also has good environmental performance. However, there are also some
disadvantages for the two fluids mentioned above. On the one hand,
the application of the CO2 transcritical power cycle2 is limited by the low critical temperature and
the high operating pressure of CO2. On the other hand,
HCs is flammable that limits its application in the large system.

In recent years, CO2, R11, R123, and so forth used as
flame retardants are added to HCs considering its flammability. Some
researchers have made progress on the mixtures of HCs and retardants
used in the ORC system. Pan et al.2 examined
the behavior of the transcritical power cycle using the zeotropic
mixture (C3H8/CO2) with a temperature
of 200 °C. Invernizzi et al.3 explored
the possibility of mixtures of CO2/HCs as working fluids
in closed power cycles. The mixture will be nonflammable, if the fraction
of CO2 is high enough. Feng et al.4 simulated the performance of CO2 with HCs (C3H8, n-C4H10, iso-C4H10, n-C5H12, iso-C5H12, and neo-C5H12) with various mass fractions based on the transcritical Rankine
cycle. Garg et al.5 investigated the flammability
suppression of HCs by adding CO2 as the retardant, and
evaluated the application capacity for these mixtures as working fluids
in ORC for medium temperature-concentrated solar power. Shu et al.6 investigated HC working fluids (cyclopentane,
cyclohexane, and benzene) mixed with flame retardants (R11 and R123)
for the application of the ORC system under high temperature waste
heat. Compared to the fluid, apart from the pseudocritical temperature,
the thermophysical properties of binary fluids exhibit large changes
near the pseudocritical point, which would cause the variations of
heat transfer characteristics. However, there are few studies concerning
the properties of the super critical CO2 binary system
in the pseudocritical region. To analyze the feasibility of supercritical
heat transfer processes, optimize the structure of the heat exchanger,
and improve the heat transfer efficiency of the system, it is very
important to obtain the thermophysical properties in CO2/alkanes in pseudocritical regions. The binary interaction parameter
(BIP) for the mixture in the attractive term of the equation of state
(EoS) is required for predicting accurately their vapor–liquid
equilibrium (VLE) properties. Usually, a BIP is necessary to adequately
describe the properties of a mixture. When predicting the VLE of mixtures,
the results obtained by the empirical correlation of BIP are more
consistent with the experimental data than with the prediction results
obtained by considering BIP as a constant.46 Therefore, obtaining an accurate BIP for the system is key to ensure
the accuracy of the physical property prediction. The BIPs can be
obtained by regression according to the experimental data of the mixture
properties and the EoS7−11 or VLE.12−14 However, it is complicated to obtain the experimental
data for BIPs. Therefore, several attempts have been made to establish
equations to estimate the BIPs based on the combination of cubic EoS
with appropriate mixing rules. Atilhan et al.13 analyzed the performance of a selected collection of EoSs for predicting
the VLE of a conventional natural gas mixture. For the binary mixtures
containing natural gases, the BIPs for the different equations are
calculated by the correlation of the available binary VLE data over
wide ranges of temperature and pressure. Haghbakhsh et al.15 studied the VLE of 14 binary mixtures in wide
temperature and pressure ranges. Combining the Peng–Robinson
(PR)16 and Esmaeilzadeh–Roshanfekr
EoSs with the van der Waals (vdW) mixing rule, the new equations for
BIP are derived based on intermolecular theories. Stavrou et al.17 proposed a quantitative structure property relationship
(QSPR) model to estimate the pure component parameters of the perturbed
chain-statistical associating fluid theory (PC-SAFT) EoS. The values
of kij estimated from
the QSPR model are compared to the values estimated from London’s
dispersive theory.

In this work, several sets of data are collected
in the open literature
for mixtures of CO2 with light alkanes and some predictive
methods are presented. The correlations of kij as a function of temperature, acentric
factor, carbon number (CN), and compressibility factor, and so forth
are listed. Although there are already many different types of models
for BIPs, there are few researches on the BIPs of binary mixtures
in the pseudocritical region, especially for the binary mixture of
CO2 with light alkanes in the pseudocritical region. Therefore,
a simple and accurate correlation of kij for CO2/light HCs mixtures in the pseudocritical
region is useful and necessary.

2 Development
of BIP
There are a lot of studies about the interaction parameters.
However,
few researches have been carried out on the BIP of CO2/alkanes
mixtures in pseudocritical regions. In this paper, we collect the
researches on the BIP of CO2/alkanes and their related
mixtures and classify the BIPs in different forms, including temperature,
acentric factor, CN, solubility, and other parameters.

2.1 Temperature-Dependent BIP
In 1967,
Chueh and Prausnitz18 analyzed critical
data for binary mixtures and expressed the critical temperature and
the critical volume as quadratic functions of the surface fraction.
They presented a modified Redlich–Kwong equation to calculate
critical pressure using critical temperatures and volumes. For binary
systems, the interaction parameter kij needs to be determined. This approach is particularly
useful for analyzing VLE in the critical region. In addition, the
critical pressures for the 36 binary systems (including paraffins,
olefins, acetylene, aromatics, N2, O2, CO2, and H2S) are calculated and compared with the
experimental results. The average deviation is 3.6%. 1  where Tcij represents the characteristic temperature. Tci and Tcj are the critical temperatures of the two
components,
respectively. kij is
determined from a large number of experimental data for the mixture
including liquid-phase properties and second virial coefficients.

In 1981, Kato et al.19 proposed a new
procedure to evaluate the BIP for CO2-containing binary
mixtures to get a better representation of the VLE. Combining the
PR EoS and a newly defined function, the optimum kij values of binary systems containing
CO2 and n-paraffins (C1–C10) for each isotherm are determined.

The kij is regarded
as a quadratic function of temperature for every binary mixture, and a, b, and c are coefficients
in the functions of paraffin’s acentric factor 2   3   4   5  where ω represents the acentric
factor
of the paraffin. Comparing the massive experimental VLE data with
the calculation results, it is easy to find that the latter predicts
more accurately than the VLE of those systems can do. Indeed, this
predictive model is superior to those methods previously proposed,20 especially at higher temperatures.

In
2004, Jaubert and Mutelet21 came
up with a group contribution method based on the PR EoS published
by Peng and Robinson in 1978. The new model for predicting kij is named PPR78 (predictive
1978, PR EoS). The kij of the mixture is a function of mixture temperature, critical temperatures
(Tci and Tcj), critical pressures (Pci and Pcj), and acentric factors (ωi and ωj) of the pure two
components. The six groups (CH3, CH2, CH, C,
CH4, and C2H6) are defined, so kij for any mixture of saturated
HCs (n-alkanes and branched alkanes) at any temperature
can be estimated. In general, the results obtained with this model
are accurate and often better in terms of accuracy than those obtained
with the EoS/gE model. 6  where Ng is the
number of different groups defined by the group contribution method.
αik is the fraction of molecule i occupied by group k. Akl and Bkl are constants, Akl = Alk, Bkl = Blk (Akk = Bkk = 0). Two
parameters A12 and B12 of the correlation on the available experimental data can
be well fitted for a given binary system.

In 2005, Mutelet et
al.22 extended the
PPR78 model for the systems containing aromatic components and defined
the interactions between the two new groups (CHaro, Caro) and the previous six ones.21 For any mixtures containing alkanes and aromatics, the estimation
of kij is achieved at
any temperature. The method ensures a high accuracy of results in
both the sub-critical and critical regions.

In 2005, Jaubert
et al.23 used a variable-volume
cell which can withstand high pressure to carry out static measurements
of VLE involving CO2/alkanes (n-heptane,
2,2,4-trimethyl pentane (iso-octane), 2,5-dimethyl hexane, and 3-methyl
pentane) between 278.15 and 413.15 K. Each molecule of these mixtures
is considered as a single group by the PPR78 model.21 A comparison between the experimental data and correlations
acquired with this model is given, which reveals that the calculated
value is in good agreement with the experimental data. 7  where A12 and B12 are constants fitted from the experimental
data.

In 2006, Vitu et al.24 developed
the
PPR78 model for the systems containing naphtenic (cyclic HC) components
by adding two new groups (CH2,cyclic, CHcyclic=Ccyclic). It is useful to predict the kij for the type of mixture
containing alkanes, aromatics, or naphtenes without the limitation
of temperature.

In 2008, Vitu et al.25 reached out the
PPR78 model for the mixtures with CO2. The interactions
between the CO2 group and the previous eleven ones24 are determined. For the mixture which contains
paraffins, naphthenes, aromatics, and CO2, kij can be estimated in a wide temperature
range. In many cases, the satisfying predictions are achieved in both
the sub-critical and critical regions by this approach.

In 2010,
Jaubert and Privat26 discussed
the BIPs of PR EoS and Soave–Redlich–Kwong (SRK) EoS.
They assume that the infinite pressure residual molar excess Gibbs
energy is independent of the used EoS. Finally, the kij of these two EoSs can be converted
to each other by introducing a parameter ξ to modify Eij 8  

For a binary system (N = 2), E11 = E22 = 0, E21 = E12. 9  

By introducing the function, the kij(T) of the SRK EoS can be simply
predicted from the group interaction parameters determined by the
PR EoS. The relationship between the kij of any two cubic EoSs is indicated as following 10   11   12  

In 2010, Soave et al.27 compared
the
fugacity coefficient equations determined from the vdW rule and the
Huron–Vidal (HV) mixing rule. Assuming that these two mixing
rules are equivalent, the BIP for the vdW mixing rule can be estimated
from infinite-pressure activity coefficients for the HV mixing rule.
The concept of main groups is introduced by the UNIFAC method. In
that model, alkanes are treated as composed by one group type and
aromatics by two types (aliphatic and aromatic). Light components
like CH4, CO2, and so forth are treated as separate
groups. Each one requires a pair of coefficients for its interactions
with groups of aliphatic and aromatic. Based on the above treatments,
the BIP of the vdW mixing rules with the SRK EoS can be derived directly. 13  where ln γ1(2)∞ represents the excess physical
properties under infinite pressure and can be calculated by the group
contribution method. 14   15   16  

In eqs 14–16, the unit of τ is bar/K. amn and bmn are constants. bmn is usually between 1 and 2.

In 2015, Duarte et
al.28 projected a
new parameterization method for Redlich–Kwong–Peng–Robinson
EoS based on the classical vdW mixing rule, which takes into account
both attractive and repulsive interaction parameters 17  where Tc1 is the
critical temperature of the component with higher volatility, kij0 is a constant.

For the system of C3H8 and higher series
(CN ≥ 3), and systems with less available data, the proposed
correlations have an advantage in making predictions for both critical
lines and subcritical VLE behavior.

2.2 BIP Depends
on Acentric Factor
In
1995, Kordas et al.29 examined the binary
systems of CH4/HCs (C2–C44) by using the translated and modified PR (t-mPR) EoS, and found
that the kij is positive
when the CN of HCs is up to 16, while negative when the CN is higher
than 16. Therefore, two correlations covering the two CN ranges are
proposed. To overcome the discontinuity that emerges when the CN is
higher than 16, the VLE data of CH4/n-C20 have included the regression for both correlations 18  

The correlation can also be
used for
calculating the kij of
the system for CH4, naphthene (CN ≤ 6) and isomers 19  

The correlation
is useful to predict the volume of saturated liquid
and vapor even in the high pressure region.

2.3 Solubility-Dependent
BIP
In 1978,
Graboski and Daubert30 estimated the VLE
of the binary mixtures containing CO2, H2S,
N2, and CO by the SRK EoS. In addition, two correlations
of BIP were compared by taking the pressure difference of the bubble
point and the quantity difference of the substance as optimization
functions. They thought that the temperature and pressure of the mixture
have a significant effect on the BIP. However, because of the different
characteristics of each system, it is difficult to distinguish the
specific influence of the temperature and pressure on the BIP value.
Moreover, comparing the kij values obtained from two different optimization functions,
the error caused by the quantity difference of the substance as the
optimization function is larger than that of solubility as the optimization
function. Therefore, they came up with a correlation with solubility
parameters to calculate the value of kij roughly 20   21  where σCO2 and
σHC are the solubility parameters of CO2 and alkane, respectively.

In 1985, Elliott and Daubert33 introduced the Graboski’s method30−32 to predict the VLE of HCs with N2, CO2, CO,
and H2S. Two methods for calculating the BIP are demonstrated
as follows 22   23  where δi and δj are the solubility
coefficients.
εi and εj are the critical factors. For systems containing CO2 24   25  

2.4 BIP Depends on Temperature
and Acentric Factor
In 1986, Moysan et al.34 investigated
the BIP values of the mixtures of HCs with H2, N2, CH4, CO2, CO, and H2S by using
the SRK EoS, ignoring the effect of pressure on the BIP and taking
into account of the temperature and solvent 26  where kat and kaj represent the effect of
temperature and solvent on kaij, respectively. For systems containing H2, N2, CH4, or CO, the effect of the solvent is negligible
(kaj = 0). For systems
containing CO2 or H2S, the effect of temperature
cannot be neglected, to be specific, it has a weak effect on the BIP
at low temperatures and a strong effect at high temperatures 27   28  

In 1988, Valderrama et al.35 expressed
the kij of mixtures of n-alkane with CO2, H2, and H2S for five different EoSs
[Soave–vdW (SVDW), SRK, PR, Patel–Teja, and Valderrama
and Cisternas], and a simple correlation was obtained. Comparing the
correlations proposed by Kato19 and Moysan,34 it is found that the kij exhibits a strong temperature dependence
on the SRK EoS. For the PR EoS, the results show a slight temperature
dependence, except for CO and n-decane 29  where A and B are constants. The constants of the SVDW,
SRK, and PR EoSs can be
calculated by the following equations 30   31  

In 1994, Kordas et al.36 demonstrated
the kij of binary systems
of CO2/HCs (C1–C44), and the
correlations applied to the t-mPR EoS and the PR EoS were proposed 32   33   34   35  where ai, bi, and ci are constants.
For the system
of CO2/CH4, the kij is presented as following 36  

For paraffins (excluding olefins), ωeff is
used
instead of ωj 37  where A = 0.658 and B = 46.027, MW is the relative molecular weight of the nonlinear
alkane, and SG is the specific gravity at 15 °C. The correlations
above are applicable to a wide temperature range and pressure range
from 150 to 200 bar. The analysis of the results shows that BIPs are
more accurate for systems with n-alkanes (CN ≥
20) than the extremely asymmetric binary systems.

In 2016, Li
et al.37 collected the VLE
experimental data for mixtures of CO2/heavy alkanes (C10–C44) with the temperature ranging from
277.59 to 663.75 K and the pressure range from 0.3 to 40.9 MPa. Finally,
a new correlation is proposed based on the PR EoS with the corrected
α(T) function 38  where ci and di are constants.

2.5 BIP Depends on the Critical
Compressibility
Factor
In 1992, Gao et al.38 proposed
a correlation to evaluate BIPs of the PR EoS for light HC (C1–C10) mixtures. The correlation is a function of
the critical temperature and compressibility factor (Zc). 39   40  where Tci and Tcj are the
critical temperatures of each component, respectively. However, the
procedure shows the discrepancies between the experimental and calculated
results for the limited region near the critical point. By comparison,
it is found that the correlation proposed by Chueh and Prausnitz18 shows a higher accuracy in the critical region.

In 1992, Lee and Sun39 applied the vdW
mixing rule to establish a model for the BIP 41  where ω1 and ω2 are the acentric
factors of the two components, respectively, Zc1 and Zc2 are the
critical compressibility factors of the two components, respectively,
and Zc1/Zc2 ≤ 1.

2.6 BIP Depends on Other Related
Physical Parameters
In 1988, Nishiumi et al.40 adopted the
PR EoS to propose the correlation of the ratio of the critical volume
and acentric factor for binary mixtures containing HCs, CO2, N2, and H2S 42   43   44  where c1, c2, d1, d2, and E are constants.

In 2003,
Gao et al.41 suggested a new mixing rule
for the cubic EoS to represent the interactions between different
molecules. Additionally, they evaluated the predictive capability
of SRK EoS and PR EoS in representing the VLE of asymmetric binary
mixtures, involving CO and CO2 in n-paraffins
(C4–C44) 45  where Aij represents the BIP and the index Nij is the parameter obtained from the regression of
experimental data. Excluding the data above 90% of critical pressure,
a correlation is proposed by combining the SRK EoS and PR EoS with
the classical mixing rule 46   47  where a is the attraction
law constant and b is the covolume of EoS.

In 2004, García-Sánchez et al.42 employed the Lorentz–Berthelot mixing rule to predict
the VLE of binary mixtures of N2/alkane (C1–C36), and obtained a series of BIPs. It should be mentioned
that the BIP of systems with light alkanes varies drastically, while
it tends to be a constant of the heavy alkanes, and the temperature
dependence is not so significant 48  where Mn-HC represents the molar mass of n-paraffins,
and MCH4 represents the molar
mass of CH4.

In 2005, Valderrama and Zavaleta43 collected
the experimental data of ten mixtures containing sub/supercritical
CO2 and n-alkanol (from methanol to decanol)
with the temperature range between 291 and 453 K and the pressure
range between 0.5 and 19.8 MPa. Combining the PR EoS with the Wong–Sandler
mixing rule, the correlations are presented 49   50  where Tc and vc represent the critical
temperature and critical
volume of n-alkanol, respectively. μ is the
dipole moment. pij represents
the coefficients Kij, Aij, and Aji. TR = T/Tc is the reduced temperature, mi and ni are constants, ψ is the polarity parameter.

In 2007, Meng et al.44 evaluated three
mixtures (H2O/alkanes, CO with nonpolar substances and
quantum with nonpolar (quantum)) and expressed kij in the second virial coefficient and got
a simple mixing rule.

CO with nonpolar substances 51  

H2O/alkanes 52  

Quantum with nonpolar (quantum) 53  where nc is the
CN of alkane. Ii and Ij are the ionization potential
parameters, and Ii > Ij.

In 2012, Pellegrini
et al.45 presented
the correlations for obtaining the BIPs for CO2/HC, H2S/HC, and CO2/H2S mixtures, where kij is a function of the standard
boiling point (NBP) or the CN (nc) of
HCs.

CO2/linear paraffin, branched paraffin, or cycloalkane
mixtures.

SRK EoS 54  

PR EoS 55  

CO2/aromatic mixtures.

SRK EoS 56   57  

PR EoS 58   59  

In 2013, Fateen et al.46 concluded a
simplified formula for kij based on the HV and vdW mixing rules of the PR EoS. However, Soave
et al.27 showed that the vdW mixing rule
is equivalent to a special regulation of the HV mixing rules, where
the regular solution depictions were used to indicate Gibbs at infinite
pressure. According to this conclusion, the values for the variable
coefficients of the developed correlation for 61 binary systems (HCs,
CO2, H2S, and N2) and 11 categories
of components are obtained. Comparing the formula predictions with
the constant-k approach, the former is better than
the latter especially when it applies to binary systems of HCs and
related components 60  where θ1, θ2, and θ3 are constants which fitted from the regression
analysis of experimental data.

In 2016, Zhang et al.47 discussed a
variety of binary mixtures containing CO2, HCs, and some
other components. They concluded that the BIP is independent of density,
molar fraction, temperature, and pressure of components, but related
to the components of mixtures 61   62  where ki and wi are the
contribution of component i, j to kij, respectively.

3 Predictive Models
From the above models, several suitable
predictive models are selected
by the following points:a The coefficient or index of the corresponding
CO2/alkane systems in the model can be obtained from the
literature.

b The model
can apply to the pseudocritical
region or high-pressure conditions of CO2/alkanes.

c The selected model should
contain different
parameters as much as possible.



Considering
the influence of physical parameters (temperature,
acentric factor, volume, etc.) on BIP, and the accuracy and application
conditions of all the correlations, the five models above are selected
for predicting the BIP of systems (CO2/alkanes (C1–C10)). The method demonstrated by Jaubert and
Mutelet21 is as follows 6  

The interaction
parameters between the groups can be found in the
literature. kij is only
a function of temperature of the mixture. As expressed in these works,21−25 the correlation is applicable to systems containing CO2, alkanes, aromatic, and cyc-alkanes. It is said that the group contribution
method is accurate near the subcritical and critical region.

The model established by Valderrama et al.35 is as follows 29  

It is applicable
to systems of CO2 with alkanes. The
coefficients A and B of each system
corresponding to different EoSs (SVDW, SRK, PR) are found in this
literature. TRj (T/Tcj) is the
reduced temperature of alkane.

The calculation suggested by
Nishiumi et al.40 is as follows 42  

The critical
volume of the mixed component can be retrieved by
REFPROP 9.1, and the coefficients C, D, and E can be obtained in the literature.40 The application results of the model in several
mixtures are discussed. It is important to point that the given approach
is accurate to estimate the kij for systems such as CH4/C3H8, CH4/n-C10H22,
C2H6/C3H8, C2H6/n-C7H16, and
cyc-C6H14/n-C12H26 in critical regions, while large deviations for C2H4/CH4, C2H4/n-C7H16, and C2H4/C3H8. In addition, the disagreement between
the prediction and the experiment is significant for mixtures with
similar physical structures.

The approach generalized by Gao
et al.41 is as follows 46  

Nij is the exponent
of the conformal combining rule obtained from the regression of experimental
data, and a is the attraction parameter of EoS. Generally,
the correlation has a wide range of applications, and it is highly
accurate to predict asymmetric systems and mixed systems containing
heavy alkanes (C4–C44).

The equation
presented by Fateen et al.46 is as follows 60  

It is suitable for predicting VLE of CO2 with HCs
in
high pressure conditions. The values of θ for CO2/alkane binary systems are listed in Table 1. In the case where these coefficients are
determined, the k12 can be determined
by the known temperature (Tr1 = T/Tc1) and pressure
(Pr1 = P/Pc1).

Indeed, some of the five models above for calculating
the BIP applied
to CO2 and HCs are without the application ranges of temperature
and pressure, and others can estimate accurately in the critical region,
but the systems of CO2 with HCs are not included. The BIP
is treated as a constant by eq 46 or as a function of temperature by eqs 6, 29, and 60 or as a function of critical volume by eq 42. Furthermore, there
are still some predictive models of BIP as a function of the acentric
factor, CN, and so forth. The physical parameters of each component
in this study originated from REFPROP 9.1 (NIST) are shown in Table A1.

4 Results and Discussion
The results of the different predictive
models are summarized in Table A2. The available
experimental data of these mixtures in the open literature48−64 are collected.

The relationship between kij and the temperature of CO2/alkanes (C1–C10, except for C9) calculated by eqs 6, 29, 46, and 60 are indicated
in Figure 1. It shows
that the variation of kij appears to have a similar tendency with temperature. This is the
opposite to the behavior of N2/n-alkanes
studied by Avlonitis et al.34 In general, kij is approximately linear
with temperature. Additionally, the BIP of alkanes (C1–C10) are nonzero, which is inconsistent with the conclusion
presented by Duarte et al.28 (Except for
CH4 and C3H8, the BIPs of alkanes
(C2–C24) are zero, and that of alkanes
(CN ≥ C24) are non-zero).

calculated by eq 60.

It is shown in Figure 1a that kij decreases
with the increases of CN except for CH4, C2H6, iso-C4H10, and n-C6H14. For a given temperature, Figure 1b shows that kij decreases with the increases of CN,
on the other hand, Figure 1c shows that there is an opposite variation tendency (except
for n-C6H14). Li et al.37 studied the BIP of CO2 with heavy
alkanes (C10–C44), and the same conclusion
is obtained that the kij decreases with the increase of CN. In Figure 1d, kij is positively correlated with the tendency of temperature
but it does not exhibit a definite regular relationship with the CN.
In summary, kij has a
strong temperature dependence. However, for systems with CO2 and H2S, the effect of temperature is weak and the main
contribution of kij is
related to the chemical structure of the solvent described by Moysan
et al.34

As clearly shown in Figure 2, for a given system,
it can be seen that the variation of kij with the pressure obtained
by these calculation models is quite different, but the shape of the
curves has some similarities. As a consequence, the kij first decreases with pressure and
then they present a transverse U-type pressure tendency (Figure 2a–d). This
behavior has not been seen in the literature.

(b) kij values calculated

(e) variation of kij with
the pressure predicted
by eq 6 at a given
temperature range from 365 to 378 K.

The variation of kij with the pressure of each mixed system in a given temperature ranging
from 365 to 378 K is demonstrated in Figure 2e. When discussing the trend of the BIP with
the pressure at a given temperature, it is difficult to ensure that
the temperature of each is consistent in the experimental data, so
a small temperature ranging from 365 to 378 K is selected. Within
this range, the temperature of each set of mixtures is considered
to be the same. As it manifests, except for the system of CO2/cyc-C6H14, the kij decreases as the pressure increases. The main reason
is that cyc-C6H14 belongs to branched alkane
rather than n-alkane (the critical pressures of n-alkanes (C1–C10) decrease
gradually). The independent variable of pressure is not involved in
these correlations except in eq 60. Eq 60 also accounts for the effect of pressure on kij that makes this correlation more versatile
and useful.46 However, Moysan et al.34 suggested that the effect of pressure on kij can be neglected compared
to the effect of temperature because the pressure effect leads to
more sophisticated EoSs or mixing rules. Li et al.37 generalized a temperature-dependent BIP correlation for
CO2/heavy n-alkane binary systems, implicitly
considering the pressure effect. In general, the range of the regressed
BIP is between 0.10 and 0.15. It is also found that the BIPs tend
to remain constant at a higher pressure range (Pr > 1.8), whereas, in a lower pressure range (Pr < 1.8), an increase in pressure can be observed with
the increased BIP for heavier n-alkanes.37 So far, we do not find too much analysis about
the pressure dependence of kij for CO2/alkane mixtures.

As shown in Figure 3a, if the models
using EoS to calculate the BIP are different, the
calculation results will be different. The kij value of CO2/alkanes (C4–C10) reaches maximum at which the CN is
5 in eqs 29 and 60. The kij calculated by eq 46 increases with increasing CN of n-alkane.
However, kij decreases
slowly with the increases of CN in eqs 6 and 42. Similar performance
has also been described in the research of Kordas et al.36 Fu et al.12 found
that, for CO2/n-alkane mixtures, the regressed kij increases monotonically
with the increase of CN in each n-alkane when CN
≤ 20, while it retains a unique value of 0.16 when the CN is
greater than 20.

Figure 3 Carbon number (CN) and acentric factor (ω) dependency
of kij for CO2/alkane
(C4, C5, C7, and C10)
systems by means of eqs 6, 29, 42, 46, and 60. (a) Effect of the CN on kij; (b) effect of the acentric
factor (ω) on kij.

In Figure 3b, it
is noticeable that kij changes little with ω less than 0.235, but varies greatly
with the ω larger than 0.235 by eqs 29 and 60 with acentric
factors. In turn, the kij calculated by eq 46 tends to increase with ω, while kij values decrease slowly with the increase of ω
by eqs 6 and 42. Therefore, the selected model has a great impact
on the results, using different types of models to calculate the BIPs
of the same system, the results are also very different.

In Figure 4, for
the systems of CO2/alkane, three different values of the
reduced temperature (Tr = T/Tc) are represented by the three plotted
curves. Through the analysis of the experimental data, it is found
that there are several reduced temperatures in these mixture systems,
which are 1.18, 1.37, and 1.4. For a given reduced temperature, it
is shown how kij varies
for the CO2/alkane systems when the CN varies between 1
and 10 (in Figure 4a). Fu et al.12 investigated the VLE for
supercritical CO2 and HC (CN ≤ 20) mixtures by PC-SAFT.
For CO2/n-alkane mixtures, the kij can be expressed as kij = 0.030128 log(n) + 0.0726141. It indicates that kij tends to decrease with acentric factor ω (see in Figure 4b), and this behavior
is opposite to the binary system of nitrogen/n-alkane
demonstrated by Avlonitis et al.65 In summary,
whatever the reduced temperature, the kij decreases with the increasing CN as well as ω.

Figure 4 CN and
acentric factor (ω) dependence of kij for CO2/alkane (C3, C4, C5, C7, and C10) systems
by eq 6 at
different reduced temperatures Tr = 1.18,
1.37, and 1.4 (Tr = Tcij/Tci, ω = xiωi + xjωj, xj = 1 – xi. i: CO2, j: alkane). (a) Effect of CN on kij; (b) effect of acentric factor (ω) on kij.

As Moysan et al.34 analyzed and described
in the research, the kij of the system (H2S/paraffins, H2S/naphtenes)
decreases linearly with ω, but for the system of H2S with aromatics, kij first decreases with ω and then increases. It can be seen
that for different mixed systems, the relationship between kij and ω is different.

In short, there is a lack of experimental data of CO2 with alkane mixtures, especially in the critical and supercritical
regions. Overall, the variation of kij with temperature, CN, and acentric factor is not
the same in different literature, which needs further experimental
and theoretical research.

According to the calculation results
of the models above, the results
obtained from eqs 6 and 42 are more reasonable and stable. However,
for a given system, kij is a constant in eq 42. It has been accepted that the kij depends on temperature, and some scholars have described that kij shows a strong temperature
dependence.18,19,21,27,28 Moreover,
Coutinho et al.66 made a theoretical explanation
about the temperature dependence of the kij parameter. In addition, eq 6 is named the group contribution method,
which is widely used in engineering calculation and is more accurate
for CO2/alkanes in the critical region than other approaches.21−25 The disadvantage of this approach is that its form is more complicated
than other methods. The contribution value of each group and the mole
fraction of each component in the mixture are offered for calculation.
In addition, a correlation proposed by Chueh and Prausnitz.18 is simple in form and only contains the temperature
of two components. It has been proved that this correlation is better
to predict the kij in
the critical region.38 The shortcoming
of this approach is that the kij values are both positive and negative, and it is difficult
to distinguish intuitively the variation of the kij with the temperature of mixtures.

To simplify the calculation process and ensure the accuracy of
the prediction, the advantages of two correlations proposed by Chueh
and Prausnitz18 and Jaubert and Mutelet21 are combined. Considering that a small temperature
difference can cause a dramatic thermophysical property change near
the pseudocritical point, the thermophysical property has a great
influence on the heat transfer characteristics of the fluid. It is
useful and necessary to establish a relationship of pseudocritical
temperature and BIP. In this work, the values obtained by eq 6 are used to fit the kij into a function of the average
reduced temperature (Tr) of binary systems.
The following generalized correlation is proposed 63  where Tr is the
average of the reduced temperature Tri and Trj. i, j represent component (CO2) and component (alkanes), respectively. Tr = 1/2(Tri + Trj), Tri = Tcij/Tci, Trj = Tcij/Tcj. Tcij is the
pseudocritical temperature of the mixture; Tci and Tcj are the critical temperature of each component, respectively.
The calculated results of BIP by eq 63 are shown in Table A2. Table 2 illustrates the coefficients (A and B) of eq 63 for these
binary systems.

The experimental data collected from the literature
is divided
into two parts: a part of data is used to calculate and fit the correlation,
and the other part of the data is used to validate the accuracy of
the correlation. Comparing the calculated results with the fitted
results, the average absolute relative deviation (AARD) of kij is defined as follows 64  where kij and kij′ represent the calculation
results under the same conditions of eqs 6 and 63, respectively. Table 3 gives the average
deviations between the calculated results and the fitted values. The
satisfactory results are obtained with an average relative error less
than 1.1%.

It can be seen in Table 4 that the kij fitted with the largest average deviation is about
3.1% (CO2/n-C10H22). Comparing
with the results obtained from the above systems listed in the paper,
the deviation is acceptable. It means that the kij for mixtures of CO2/alkanes
in the pseudocritical region is possible to be estimated by the correlation
fitted in this study.

5 Conclusions
BIPs
are the basis to predict the thermophysical properties and
it is also the key to study the heat transfer characteristics of mixtures.
The existing researches on BIPs for CO2/HCs and their component-related
mixtures are reviewed here. Moreover, five predictive models are selected
for predicting the kij of mixtures containing CO2/alkanes (C1–C10) in pseudocritical regions. The variation rules of kij with temperature, pressure,
CN, and acentric factor are also discussed in the end. The main conclusions
of this work are listed as the following:1 Using the correlations
of the kij with pressure
or without
pressure to estimate the BIPs, it can be found that the kij does not change monotonically with
pressure. However, the shape of the curves has some similarities and
presents a transverse U-type pressure tendency.

2 The kij obtained from every selected correlations varies monotonically
with the variation of temperature. Based on the results obtained by
the group contribution method, a simpler and intuitive correlation
rule with deduced temperature is developed and presented.

3 The new correlation estimates kij for CO2 with
light alkanes in pseudocritical regions. The minimum absolute error
is 0.10%, and the maximum absolute error is 3.09%.
