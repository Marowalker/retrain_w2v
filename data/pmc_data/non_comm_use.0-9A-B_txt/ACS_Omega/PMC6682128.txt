As hepatitis C virus
(HCV) is one of the major health problems
in many countries, interest has been aroused in the design, synthesis,
and optimization of novel NS5A inhibitors, outside the chemical space
of currently available direct acting antivirals (DAAs). Two series
of symmetric molecules with core scaffold 3,3′-(buta-1,3-diyne-1,4-diyl)dianiline
or 4,4′-(buta-1,3-diyne-1,4-diyl)dianiline, coupled on its
nitrogen as amide with different end caps, were synthesized and tested
for their activities against HCV by using cell-based antiviral assays.
Molecules with the 3,3′-(buta-1,3-diyne-1,4-diyl)dianiline
core were more active than their 4,4′-congeners. Only the 3,3′-derivatives
showed noncoplanarity of core phenyls that mostly led to a better
interaction with the target protein and appears to be a crucial element
for efficient inhibition of HCV replication. Compounds 2f and 2q exhibited potent inhibition of genotype (GT) 1b HCV replication with EC50 values in the picomolar
range and selectivity index greater than 6 orders of magnitude. The
compounds seem more selective toward GT 1b and 4a. In conclusion, novel symmetric molecules with a 3,3′-(buta-1,3-diyne-1,4-diyl)dianiline
core are potent and selective inhibitors that provide new extension
to explore the structure–activity relationship of NS5A targeting
DAAs.

Introduction
Hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) is a
health issue known worldwide.
It is estimated that more than 70 million people are currently infected.1 It is a major causative agent of chronic liver
illness and can prompt liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.
HCV belongs to the Flaviviridae family, Hepacivirus genus.2 The viral genome is a single-strand RNA of positive
polarity and it is 9600 nucleotides in length. It possesses one large
open reading frame (ORF) with untranslated regions (UTR) in both 5′
and 3′ ends. These UTR regions are well-conserved RNA structures
essential for translation and viral genome replication.3,4 A single polyprotein precursor is encoded by the ORF. After processing,
the polyprotein gives the structural proteins core, E1 and E2, p7
needed for virus assembly and release, and the nonstructural proteins
NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B. Together with host cell factors,
the NS proteins share in the formation of membrane-associated replication
complex.3,4

There are eight major genotypes (GTs)
of HCV and a minimum of 86
subtypes.5 Genotype 1 is the world’s
most prevalent and responsible for about 50% of HCV infections in
Europe, North America, and Japan; genotype 2 is mainly found in Europe,
North America, West Africa, and Japan; genotype 3 and 6 are mostly
present in Southeast Asia genotype 4 has its highest prevalence in
Egypt while genotype 5 predominates in South Africa.6

Several therapeutic options have been established
for HCV-infected
individuals. Not long ago, the standard-of-care for the HCV treatment
was a dual therapy regimen consisting of ribavirin (RBV), an orally
administered analogue of guanosine that is given twice daily, and
pegylated-interferon alpha, administered as a subcutaneous injection
once per week. However, because of several reasons including serious
side effects, low sustained virologic response (SVR) rates, long treatment
duration up to 48 weeks, and poor patient tolerance, more suitable
treatment strategies were required.7 In
2011, direct acting antivirals (DAAs) were introduced and revolutionized
HCV treatment. Since then, DAAs were developed inhibiting the viral
NS3/4A protease complex, the NS5B RNA polymerase, and the NS5A phosphoprotein
important for genome replication and particle production. These DAAs
allowed the implementation of interferon-free treatment schedules
that are based on two or three DAAs with different modes of action
combined and may include ribavirin.8,9 Although DAAs
are highly effective in most HCV-infected patients, especially in
the case of NS5A inhibitors, a risk exists that resistance may develop,
according to the genotype and the regimen.10 Additionally, available DAAs are expensive (several thousand euros
per treatment), which limits the access to therapy in low-income countries.
Thus, there is a remaining and serious need for new effective NS5A
inhibitors that will reduce the high cost of treatment.

NS5A
is a zinc-binding phosphoprotein. It consists of 447 amino
acid residues, with three domains separated by two linker regions
having sequences of low complexity. Domains I (D1) and II (D2) are
necessary for viral genome replication, whereas the assembly of virus
particles requires domain III (D3). The first 31 amino acids of D1,
which are conserved in all HCV GTs, contains an amphipathic α-helix,
responsible for anchoring the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) and the surface of lipid droplets.11 Amino acids 36–100 (subdomain 1a) coordinate
a single zinc atom via four cysteine residues and can homodimerize,
forming at least two unique dimeric complexes. The remaining amino
acids 101–213 (subdomain 1b) participate in the
formation of a putative RNA-binding domain at one of the homodimer
interfaces.12 NS5A’s D2 and D3 are
inherently disordered and highly flexible, highlighting NS5A’s
wide range of protein interactions.11 For
example, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIIα (PI4KIIIa) interacts
with the C-terminus of D113 and cyclophilin
A with D2 and D3.14,15 Several kinases, such as mitogen-activated
protein kinase 1, casein kinase Iα and II, and AKT, appear to
phosphoryle NS5A at multiple serine and threonine residues. As a result,
NS5A exists as several phospho variants, appearing in a standard gel
system as two major forms with 56 and 58 kDa apparent molecular weights.
Available data suggest that the p56 form is primarily unphosphorylated
or basally phosphorylated, while the p58 form is hyperphosphorylated.
Phosphorylation of NS5A was shown to affect RNA replication, virus
assembly, and innate antiviral defense.11 However, the precise molecular mechanism underlying NS5A functions
remains unknown, which is mainly due to the fact that the structure
of membrane-bound NS5A has not been resolved, the nature of NS5A homooligomers
in cells is unknown, and it is unclear how the phosphorylation status
affects NS5A interaction with various viral and cellular proteins.

While the crystal structure of the N-terminal region of NS5A has
been determined, the differences in the reported data concerning dimer
orientation and the absence of a resolved structure for the inhibitor–protein
complex renders structure-based rational drug design a difficult approach.16,17 Because of this and the absence of a known enzymatic activity for
NS5A, structure–activity relationships (SARs) for NS5A inhibitors
have been mainly deduced by cell-based HCV replication assays, an
often-used assay being HCV “mini-genomes”, also called
replicons that are autonomously replicating in human hepatoma cells
that are easy to culture.18

NS5A
inhibitors block both viral RNA synthesis and virion assembly;
however, the precise mechanism is unknown. Inhibition might be due
to a block of the formation of the membrane-associated HCV replication
complex, a perturbation of the interactions of NS5A with other viral/cellular
proteins, redistributing NS5A from the ER to the lipid droplet surface,
potentially modifying the active HCV replication complex, and/or a
block of NS5A oligomerization.19 Currently
approved NS5A inhibitors are extremely potent, inhibiting viral replication
with picomolar concentrations. However, the inhibitor efficiency can
be drastically reduced because of the presence of NS5A resistance-associated
mutations, which can exist already prior to treatment (baseline),
and are rapidly selected during the NS5A-based DAA treatment.20 Therefore, ongoing studies are aiming to discover
next-generation RBV and interferon-free DAAs for once daily oral regimens,
with pangenotypic and more potent activity, thus allowing to shorten
treatment duration and to increase the genetic barrier to resistance.

Because of their high potency, NS5A inhibitors are included in
all DAA-only cocktails used in clinical trials or approved for hepatitis
C. Specifically, several combinations are currently available for
genotype 1 HCV patients. For genotype 4, the regimens paritaprevir/ombitasvir/ritonavir
and grazoprevir/elbasvir were approved and the sofosbuvir/ledipasvir
combination obtained additional genotype approval 4–6. The
next generation of DAAs aimed at achieving SVR in HCV GTs 1–6
and at inhibiting viral replication of strains resistant to first-generation
treatments. Additionally, two next-generation treatments, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir
and glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, for HCV GTs 1–6 and 1, 2, 5,
6, respectively, have been approved.21,22

Because
of the fact that NS5A exists as a homodimer, the use of
symmetric molecules is a rational approach for developing NS5A inhibitors.23,24 In this work, we are interested in the design, synthesis, and optimization
of novel NS5A inhibitors, outside of the chemical space covered by
current patents and with pan-genotypic activity. Using the previously
reported NS5A inhibitor ombitasvir,25 a
first generation NS5A inhibitor, as starting point, the following
modifications were introduced: the 1-(4-tert-butyl-phenyl)-2,5-diphenyl-pyrrolidine
core was replaced by either a 3,3′-(buta-1,3-diyne-1,4-diyl)dianiline
or a 4-[4-(4-aminophenyl)buta-1,3-diyn-1-yl]aniline core, l-proline residue was kept or replaced by the unnatural d-proline amino acid, l-valine was retained or replaced by l-leucine, l-isoleucine, unnatural d-valine,
or d-leucine, and the terminal methyl chain was kept or replaced
by ethyl, butyl, isobutyl, or a benzyl group (Figure 1).

Results and Discussion
Chemistry
The reactions adopted
in Scheme 1 started
with 3- or 4-ethynylaniline
where Eglinton dimerization reaction was conducted using a stoichiometric
amount of copper (II) salt in pyridine and afforded compounds (A1–A2). This step was followed by amide coupling with
either N-boc-l-proline or N-boc-d-proline using HBTU as a coupling reagent to afford
compounds (B1–B4). Then, deprotection of the boc
protecting group using TFA led to compounds (C1–C4) as outlined in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Route
Reagents
and conditions: (i)
Cu(OAc)2, pyridine/MeOH, 60 °C, 2 h. Yield: 84–100%
(ii) HBTU, TEA, CH2Cl2, room temperatures, 2
h. Yield: 65–73% (iii) TFA/CH2Cl2, room
temperature, 24 h. Yield: 49–67% (iv) HBTU, TEA, CH2Cl2, room temperature, 4 h. Yield: 6.5–88%.

Five series of terminal capping groups (Scheme 2) were synthesized
using different alkyl
and benzyl carbamates of different d and l amino
acids. The first series of capping groups were synthesized by reacting l-valine with methyl chloroformate, ethyl chloroformate, butyl
chloroformate, isobutyl chloroformate, and benzyl chloroformate to
yield the respective carbamate derivatives. The second series of capping
groups were synthesized by reacting l-leucine with methyl,
ethyl, butyl, and benzyl chloroformates to yield the respective carbamate
derivatives. As for the third series of capping groups, they were
synthesized by reacting l-isoleucine with ethyl, butyl, and
benzyl chloroformates to yield the respective carbamate derivatives. d-Leucine was reacted with methyl and ethyl chloroformate to
give the fourth series of capping groups. Finally, d-valine
was reacted with ethyl chloroformate to yield the respective carbamate
derivative. The carbamate derivatives were coupled with compounds
(C1–C4) to afford compounds 1a–1p and 2a–2q, outlined in Scheme 1.

Scheme 2 Preparation of Amino Acid Carbamates
Reagents and conditions: (i)
NaOH/1,4-dioxane, room temperature, overnight. Yield: 48–51%.

Biological Evaluation
Compound Screening Against
HCV Genotype 1b Replicon
The synthesized compounds
were evaluated for their activity against
HCV RNA replication and their toxicity in the Huh5-2 stable
cell line harboring a reporter HCV genotype 1b (strain
Con1) replicon.26 The firefly luciferase
(F-Luc) expressed from the replicon is directly correlated with the
viral replication levels. The median cytotoxic concentration (CC50) and the half maximum effective concentration (EC50) were obtained using serial dilutions of the compounds and by quantifying
ATP levels inside the cells and HCV replication-driven luciferase
activity, respectively (Table 1). For the most potent analogues, the dose–response
curve analysis is presented (Figure 2). Selectivity indices (SI50) = CC50/EC50 were calculated for all compounds tested.

Figure 2 Dose–response
curves for compounds 2a, 2f, 2p, and 2q against replication
of HCV genotype 1b RNA. Huh5-2 replicon cells were seeded
at a confluency of 30 percent and treated with compounds’ serial
dilutions for 72 h. F-Luc activity was measured and expressed as relative
light units (RLU) per μg of total protein. Values from compound-treated
cells were expressed relatively to the ones from solvent-treated dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) (control) cells. Daclatasvir was used as a positive
control. Bars represent mean values from three independent triplicate
experiments. Error bars represent standard deviation (SD).

Structure–Activity
Relationship
SARs was evaluated
based on three key structural features, (i) the stereochemistry of
the two chiral carbons of the amino acid proline (ii) the stereochemistry
and the size of the terminal lipophilic amino acid cap and (iii) the
nature and size of the terminal O-substituent: alkyl and arylalkyl
carbamates.

Stereochemistry of 2 Chiral
Carbons of the Amino
Acid Proline
We compared the potency of the compounds with d-proline versus those with l-proline. Several 4-ethynylaniline-derived
analogues containing l-proline showed EC50 values
in the low micromolar and submicromolar range, while 3-ethynylaniline-derived
analogues had EC50 values in the nanomolar and subnanomolar
range. Meanwhile, their respective analogues having d-proline
were of lower activity or inactive at the highest concentration tested
(10 μM), as indicated by the comparison of compound 1b versus 1j, compound 1n versus 1k, and compound 1f versus 1l, as well as
compound 2b versus 2j, compound 2n versus 2k, compound 2f versus 2l, and compound 2q versus 2m. The above
comparison indicates that the proline moiety is involved in stereochemically
dependent interactions with the target protein (Table 1).

Role of the Size and Stereochemistry
of the Terminal Amino Acid
(Cap)
Three aliphatic lipophilic amino acids (valine, leucine,
or isoleucine) were included for comparisons: in the case of 4-ethynylaniline-derived
analogues, compound 1b is 3-fold more active than compound 1n, which indicates that the (S) configuration
is preferred over (R). In the case of 3-ethynylanilin-derived
analogues, comparing compounds 2b versus 2n, 2o versus 2p, and 2f versus 2q, we observed the following: 2n (d-valine ethyl analogue) is more active than 2b (l-valine ethyl analogue) by about 6 fold and 2p (d-leucine methyl analogue) is more active than 2o (l-leucine methyl analogue) by about 3 × 105 fold. However, compounds 2f (l-leucine ethyl
analogue) and 2q (d-leucine ethyl analogue)
were observed to be equipotent. In conclusion, d-amino acid
analogues are more active than those containing l-amino acids
with only one exception, compound 2f (l-leucine
ethyl analogue). All of the above indicate that the terminal capping
residue does not appear to have stereoselective interactions with
the binding site of NS5A. These results are important for the development
of new peptidic lead compounds and add a new dimension to studies
of peptidic molecules and their functions. Moreover, this confirms
the usefulness of the peptidomimetic approach for the molecular characterization
and the structural modification of the drugs in order to improve their
physicochemical properties.

Next, the preferred size (valine,
leucine, or isoleucine) of the terminal amino acid for the potency
of the compounds is explored. To this end, in the case of 4-ethynylaniline-derived
analogues, when comparing the EC50 values of compound 1b versus compounds 1f and 1h, the
less bulky valine showed to confer higher activity than isoleucine
and leucine. This pattern is confirmed by the relative potency of
compounds 1e versus 1o and 1p. Interestingly, for 3-ethynylaniline-derived analogues, comparing
the activities of compound 2f versus 2b and 2h showed significantly higher potency in the presence of
leucine, as compared to isoleucine and valine. Thus, unlike most of
the clinically used NS5A inhibitors, in which the capping residue
is l-valine, herein, we introduce other lipophilic amino
acids as valuable substitutes for valine. This expands the chemical
space for the discovery of novel NS5A inhibitors.

Size of the
Terminal O-Substituent (Alkyl Carbamate) for the
Capping Group
In 4-ethynylaniline-derived analogues, activity
data for compounds 1b, 1c, 1d, and 1a, have clearly shown that the less-bulky, less-branched
methyl substituent gives the highest activity followed by ethyl, butyl,
and then the isobutyl substituent. Similarly, for 3-ethynylaniline-derived
analogues 2a, 2b, 2c, and 2d containing l-valine, the less-bulky, less-branched
methyl substituent also gives the highest activity followed by isobutyl,
ethyl, and then butyl. However, the situation is almost reversed in
the case of compounds having the l-leucine capping group 2o, 2f, and 2g, where the ethyl
substituent gives the highest activity, whereas methyl and butyl show
no activity at the highest concentration used. Similarly, for d-leucine capping containing compounds 2p and 2q, the ethyl substituent showed higher activity than the
methyl derivative. In conclusion, it was found that for l-valine capping, the order of activity from highest to lowest is
methyl > isobutyl > ethyl > butyl. However, in the case of l- and d-leucine capping, the order of activity from
highest
to lowest is ethyl > methyl. Thus, the size of terminal amino acid
and the size of the substituent in the terminal oxygen have interdependent
roles and should be viewed in the context of the properties of the
whole capping group (Table 1).

Studying the implication of the size and nature of
the terminal O-substituent (alkyl vs aryl), in the case of 4-ethynylaniline-derived
analogues, the benzyl derivative compound 1e is found
to be 28-fold less active than the ethyl derivative compound 1b. This indicates a potential steric clash of benzyl carbamate
at the two terminals of the compound with the binding sites of NS5A.
The same indication also exists for 3-ethynylaniline-derived analogues,
as the benzyl-substituted derivative 2e (l-valine
benzyl derivative) is 22-fold less active than ethyl-substituted 2b.

Comparison of the clinically used NS5A inhibitor
daclatasvir with
the most active compound 2f (l-leucine ethyl
analogue) shows that they are almost equipotent, indicating the value
of our approach in developing new anti-HCV agents.

Cytotoxicity
and Selectivity of the Synthesized Compounds
Concerning the
cytotoxicity (CC50) and selectivity (SI50) of
the analogues in Huh5-2 replicon cells (Table 1), we observed that all the
4-ethynylaniline-derived compounds (1a–1p) showed
high selectivity to inhibit virus replication. The most potent of
them, 1a, is also the one with the highest selectivity
index, as it shows SI50 of 1101. Moreover, for the most
active 3-ethynylaniline-derived compounds that were tested up to 200
μM concentration, we observed very high selectivity indices
with SI50s ranging from 1.5 × 106 to 5
× 106. The most potent compound, 2f (l-leucine ethyl analogue), showed the highest SI50 (>5 010 020), which might give a preliminary indication
about safety and the suitability of the developed scaffold for further
drug development.

Compound Activity Against HCV 3a and 4a Replicon Cells
For the most potent
anti-HCV 1b 3-ethynylaniline-derived analogues, 2a, 2f, 2p, and 2q,
their activity against other
GTs was also tested. In detail, we measured viral replication-driven
F-Luc activity in Huh7.5-3a and Huh7.5-4a stable cell lines harboring HCV genotype 3a (strain
S52) and 4a (strain ED43) replicons, respectively. All
four compounds had significant activity against genotype 4a, with 2a (l-valine methyl derivative) being
the most active, with EC50 = 6.11 nM, and the safest, with
SI50 > 32 733 (Table 2). This confirms that analogues 2a, 2f, 2p, and 2q have activity
against 1b and 4a like daclatasvir and ombitasvir.
However,
their potency was higher against genotype 1b by 50–2440-fold.
Nevertheless, they exhibited marginal activity against genotype 3a.

Validation of Compounds’
Activity with Other Methods
By determining the levels of
viral RNA and NS5A proteins, we validated
the inhibition potency of the compounds observed in luciferase activity
assays against HCV genotype 1b. Huh5-2 cells were mock-treated
(control) or incubated with compounds 2f and 2q at 0.5 and 0.05 nM. Total RNA was extracted from cells and HCV RNA
was quantified by reverse transcription–quantitative polymerase
chain reaction (RT–qPCR), while NS5A levels were examined in
paraformaldehyde-fixed cells by indirect immunofluorescence/confocal
microscopy analysis (Figure 3A). We found that 0.05 nM of compound 2q reduced
HCV RNA replication to 56%, whereas the same concentration of compound 2f reduced HCV RNA to ∼90% arguing for higher potency
of compound 2f. In agreement, indirect immunofluorescence
analysis of HCV NS5A in Huh5-2 cells showed almost undetectable levels
of the viral protein at the highest compound concentration used (Figure 3B). Note that cell
viability was not affected, as shown by nuclei staining with propidium
iodide (PI). This result corroborates that compound 2f is a more potent NS5A inhibitor than 2q against the
HCV genotype 1b replicon.

Molecular Modelling
We adopted a computational approach
to explain the higher activity of compound 2f relative
to its analogue with the 4,4′-(buta-1,3-diyne-1,4-diyl)dianiline
core 1f (EC50 = 4.3 μM). Interestingly,
the energy minimized form of the much less-active analogue 1f showed planarity of the core scaffold and a relatively extended
structure of the whole molecule (Figure 4); this is expected because of the extended
conjugation present in the p,p′-disubstituted
core. In contrast, compound 2f showed a clear noncoplanarity
between the two core aniline rings, Figure 4. It is worth mentioning that the conjugation
in this molecule cannot include the amide moieties as they are meta-oriented
relative to the diphenyldiyne central core. This m-orientation causes proline and capping residue carbamate to be less
extended and to be in spatial projection that leads to better interaction
with the binding site of NS5A.

Figure 4 Energy minimized form of compound 1f (A) with the
4,4′-(buta-1,3-diyne-1,4-diyl)dianiline core showing coplanarity
between the two core aniline rings and compound 2f (B)
with the 3,3′-(buta-1,3-diyne-1,4-diyl)dianiline core showing
different spatial projection and non co-orientation of the two core
aniline rings and their capping groups, (C) the energy minimized form
of ombitasvir showing noncoplanarity of two phenyls and different
spatial orientations of the two capping groups (D) an overlay of 1f and 2f showing different orientations of the
two capping groups at one end. Energy minimization was done by MMFF94x
forcefield and followed by automatic overlaying using MOE software.

Conclusions
Novel
NS5A inhibitors of the core scaffolds 3,3′-(buta-1,3-diyne-1,4-diyl)dianiline
and 4,4′-(buta-1,3-diyne-1,4-diyl)dianiline with different
capping groups are presented. Our results showed that the 3,3′-disubstituted
core has a superior activity over the 4,4′-disubstituted core
which can be attributed to the difference in the adopted conformation
and relative orientation of the key binding groups in the binding
site. Additionally, using l-leucine in the end-capping group
with the 3,3′-disubstituted core can show higher potency (in
the picomolar range) than the frequently used l-valine, adding
new insight to the possible diversity of the designed inhibitors.
New structural analogues will be generated in order to investigate
the conformational aspects of the core scaffold and acquire more SAR
information to help refine the requirements for optimal activity.

Chemistry
Solvents and reagents were obtained from
commercial suppliers and were used without further purification. All
organic solvents used were of pure analytical grade. Column chromatography
was carried out using silica-gel 70–230 μm mesh. Reaction
progress was monitored by TLC using fluorescent precoated silica gel
plates and detection of the components was made by short UV light
(λ = 254 nm). Carbamates were detected using the furfural/sulphuric
acid detection reagent. 1H NMR spectra were run at either
300 or 500 MHz and 13C NMR spectra were run at 75 or 101
or 126 MHz in the deuterated solvent (DMSO-d6). Chemical shift (δ) were reported in parts per million
(ppm) downfield from TMS, and all coupling constants (J) are given in Hz. Multiplicities are abbreviated as s: singlet;
d: doublet; t: triplet; q: quartet; m: multiplet; dd: doublet of doublet;
dt: doublet of triplet; and brs: broad singlet. The purities of the
tested compounds were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) coupled with a mass spectrometer and were higher than 90% for
all compounds. Mass spectra were obtained on the (HPLC–ESI-MS)
instrument equipped with an ESI source and a triple quadrupole mass
detector (Thermo Finnigan). MS detection was carried out at a spray
voltage of 4.2 kV, a nitrogen sheath gas pressure of 4 × 105 Pa, an auxiliary gas pressure of 1 × 105 Pa,
a capillary temperature of 400 °C, a capillary voltage of 35
V, and a source CID of 10 V. All samples were injected by autosampler
(Surveyor, Thermo Finnigan) with an injection volume of 10 μL.
A RP C18 NUCLEODUR 100–3 (125 mm × 3 mm) column (Macherey-Nagel)
was used as the stationary phase. The solvent system consisted of
water containing 0.1% TFA (A) and 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile (B). HPLC
method: flow rate 400 μL/min. The percentage of B started at
an initial of 5%, was increased up to 100% during 16 min, kept at
100% for 2 min, and flushed back to 5% in 2 min. All masses were reported
as the protonated parent ion (M + H)+ or (M + Na)+ or (M)+. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra
were performed either at the main Chemical Warfare Laboratories, Chemical
Warfare Department, Ministry of Defense at 400 MHz using a Varian
Mercury 400 Plus spectrometer or at HIPS, Saarland at 500 MHz using
a Bruker DRX-500 spectrometer. All reactions were carried out under
nitrogen when inert atmosphere was needed. All starting materials
were obtained from commercial suppliers and were used without further
purification.

Biological Assays
Cell Culture
The
Huh5-226 stable cell line harbors the subgenomic
HCV 1b reporter replicon
I389luc-ubi-neo/NS3-3′/Con1/5.1 (strain Con1). Huh7.5-3a and Huh7.5-4a cells harbor the subgenomic
replicons S52-SG (Feo) (AII) and ED43-SG (Feo) (VYG) (kindly provided
by C.M. Rice, The Rockefeller University, NY)27 of HCV 3a (strain S52) and 4a (strain
ED43), respectively.28

Cells were
cultured using Dulbecco’s modified minimum essential medium
with high glucose (25 mM) (Invitrogen), supplemented with 2 mM l-glutamine, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, 100 U/mL penicillin,
100 μg/mL streptomycin, 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum [complete
Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM)], and either 500 μg/mL
G418 for Huh5-2, 750 μg/mL G418 for Huh7.5-3a,
or 350 μg/mL G418 for Huh7.5-4a.

Cell-Based
Antiviral Assays
Viral replication was determined
by measuring F-Luc activity in replicon cells seeded 104 per well in a 96-well plate, cultured with G418 in complete DMEM
for 24 h at 37 °C (5% CO2), and further incubated
in the presence of serial dilutions of the compounds, or their solvent
DMSO, in a total volume of 100 μL in complete DMEM without G418.
Three days post-treatment, cells were lysed and F-Luc activity was
quantified and expressed as relative units of luminescence (RLU) per
μg of total protein. The compound concentration that reduces
luciferase expression by 50% (median effective concentration—EC50) was determined after conversion of drug concentrations
to log X and nonlinear regression analysis (Prism
5.0 software, GraphPad Software Inc.).

Luciferase and Bradford
Assays
F-Luc measurement in
cell lysates was performed with a chemiluminescent assay kit (Promega)
in accordance to manufacturer’s instructions, in a GloMax 20/20
single tube luminometer (Promega) for 10 s. F-Luc activity levels
were normalized to total intracellular protein amounts as determined
by Bradford assay (Pierce).

Cytotoxicity Assay
The effect of the compounds on cell
viability was evaluated by quantifying intracellular ATP levels in
cells seeded 104 per well in a 96-well plate, cultured
in complete DMEM for 24 h, and further incubated with the compounds
or their solvent DMSO. Three days post-treatment, cells were lysed
and ATP was measured. The compound concentration causing 50% cell
death (CC50) was calculated after conversion of drug concentration
to log X and nonlinear regression analysis (Prism
5.0 software, GraphPad Software Inc.).

Measurement of Intracellular
ATP Levels
ATP levels
were determined using the ViaLight HS chemiluminescence-based assay
kit (Lonza) in accordance to the manufacturer’s instructions,
in a GloMax 20/20 single-tube luminometer (Promega) for 1 s, and normalized
to total intracellular protein amounts (Bradford assay, Pierce).

Indirect Immunofluorescence
Indirect immunofluorescence
for Con1 NS5A was carried out as previously described.29 DNA staining was performed using PI (Sigma-Aldrich).
Images were obtained using the Leica TCS-SP5II Two-photon Confocal
Microscope with Spectra Physics Mai Tai infrared laser source.

Total
RNA Extraction and HCV RNA Quantification
Total
RNA from Huh5-2 cells was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Ambion),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. HCV RNA levels
were determined with RT and qPCR. RT reaction was performed using
Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) and
the reverse primer 5′-GGATTCGTGCTCATGGTGCA-3′ specific
for Con1 IRES (IRES-R). qPCR reactions were carried out using KAPA
SYBR FAST qPCR Master Mix (Kapa Biosystems) and the Con1 IRES specific
primers IRES-F (5′-GGCCTTGTGGTACTGCCTGATA-3′) and IRES-R.
The housekeeping gene YWHAZ was used for normalization (primers 5′-GCTGGTGATGACAAGAAAGG-3′
and 5′-GGATGTGTTGGTTGCATTTCCT-3′).

Statistical
Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed
using Student’s t-test in Excel Microsoft
Office. Only results with p ≤ 0.05 were considered
as statistically significant and shown.
