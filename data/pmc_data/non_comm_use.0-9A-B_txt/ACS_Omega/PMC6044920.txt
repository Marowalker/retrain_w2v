Synthesis
of iminosugars 1, 2, 3a, and 4a and N-alkyl (ethyl, butyl, hexyl,
octyl, decyl, and dodecyl) derivatives 3b–g and 4b–g spiro-linked with
morpholine-fused 1,2,3-triazole is described. Conformation of the
piperidine ring in each spiro-iminosugar was evaluated by 1H NMR spectroscopy, and conformational change in N-alkylated compounds 4b–g with respect to parent spiro-iminosugar 4a is supported by density functional theory calculations.
Out of 16 new spiro-iminosugars, the spiro-iminosugars 3a (IC50 = 0.075 μM) and 4a (IC50 = 0.036 μM) were found to be more potent inhibitors of α-glucosidase
than the marketed drug miglitol (IC50 = 0.100 μM).
In addition, 3a (minimum inhibition concentration (MIC)
= 0.85 μM) and 4a (MIC = 0.025 μM) showed
more potent antifungal activity against Candida albicans than antifungal drug amphotericin b (MIC = 1.25 μM). In few
cases, the N-alkyl derivatives showed increase of α-glucosidase
inhibition and enhancement of antifungal activity compare to the respective
parent iminosugar. The biological activities were further substantiated
by molecular docking studies.

==== Body
Introduction
Glycosidases play a
key role in intestinal digestion, post-translational
processing of glycoproteins, endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation
mechanisms, and the lysosomal catabolism of glycoconjugates.1 Any malfunction in this process leads to discomforts
in the body, and in case of long-run processes, one suffers from disease.2 For example, disorders in functioning of amylase
and/or α-glucosidase enzymes results in alteration in the blood
glucose level, a condition noted as diabetes mellitus type-II (DM-II).3 Patients suffering from long-term DM-II develop low immunity4 and fall as a prey to a variety of comorbidities,
such as retinopathy,5 nephropathy,6 neuropathy,7 infections,8 and many more.9 In
particular, sugar damp in diabetes nurtures the infections of Candida albicans yeast in mouth, skin, nails, and
surroundings of urethral openings.10 In
such cases of comorbidity discomforts, an effective treatment is a
challenge and prescription of two separate drugs is a common medicinal
practice. Among a variety of antidiabetic drugs, an iminosugar (cyclic
sugars with the nitrogen atom in place of the ring oxygen atom) class
of compound, namely, glycet/miglitol I (Figure 1) is consumed for the treatment
of DM-II,11 whereas, for the treatment
of fungal infection, 1,2,4-triazole-containing drug fluconazole12 is practiced. Alternatively, hybrid/chimeric
drugs, in which two pharmacophores are present in one molecule and
thus showing dual therapeutic mechanism, would have been the most
appropriate choice.13,14 In this direction, a number of
hybrid drugs were synthesized and evaluated for biological activities.14 Among these, iminosugars attached with other
pharmacophores have attracted a great deal of interest.1,15 For example, iminosugar fused with tetrazole II (Figure 1) showed antitubercular
as well as α-rhamnosidase inhibitory activity.16 Iminosugar fused with imidazole ring, namely, nagstatin
(III) is an N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase
inhibitor and acts as an anticancer agent,1,17 whereas
iminosugar fused with 1,2,4-triazole IV shows inhibition
toward α-mannosidase along with anticancer activity.1 A few examples of the iminosugars spiro-linked
with other pharmacophores are also known.a,18 Laroche et al. reported a titanium-mediated
aminocyclopropanation of nitriles to give pyrrolidine iminosugar spiro-linked
with cyclopropane V.19 Vankar
and co-workers utilized the RCM strategy in the synthesis of iminosugar
spiro-linked with the sugar pyranose VI.20 Compain and co-workers used C–H amination and RCM
methodology to build 5-azaspiro[3,4]octane VII skeleton.21

Figure 1 Known iminosugars and target molecules.

Our group has exploited Corey-link approach with
3-oxo-1,2;5,6-diisopropylidene-d-gluco-furanose to give C3-azido-3-formyl-substituted d-gluco-furanose that
was elaborated toward the synthesis of
spiro-iminosugars VIIIa/VIIIb, which showed
a promising α-glucosidase inhibitory activity.22 In the continuation of our work, we now report the synthesis
of tricyclic azepine 1, piperidine iminosugars 2, 3a–g, and iminosugars 4a–g spiro-linked with the morpholine-fused
1,2,3-triazol. The conformations 1C4/4C1 were obtained
on the basis of the 1H NMR study and substantiated by density
functional theory (DFT) studies. The glycosidase inhibitory and antifungal
(on Candida albicans yeast cells) activities
were evaluated. Among the 16 targeted molecules, iminosugar 3a (IC50 = 0.075 μM) and iminosugar 4a (IC50 = 0.036 μM) were found to be highly
potent α-glucosidase inhibitors compared to miglitol I (IC50 = 0.100 μM). In addition, 3a (minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) = 0.85 μM) and 4a (MIC = 0.025 μM) were noticed to be highly potent
antifungal agents compared to marketed drug amphotericin b (MIC =
1.25 μM). As the hybrid drugs are known to increase cellular
uptake that augment the specific pharmacological activity,b,23 an analogous
trend was noticed with the spiro-iminosugars 1, 2, 3a–g, and 4a–g in the augmentation of the glycosidase inhibitory
as well as antifungal activity due to the presence of iminosugar and
triazole pharmacophores in the same molecule. Our results toward the
synthesis, conformations, glycosidase, and antifungal activity as
well as molecular docking studies of spiro-iminosugars are described
herein.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of Spiro-Iminosugars (1, 2, 3a–g, and 4a–g)
Recently, we have studied the role of gem-disubstituent
effect in intramolecular alkyne-azide 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (AAC)
reaction with O-propargylated azido compounds IXa–d by experimental kinetic data and thermodynamic parameters
obtained from computational studies (Figure 2).24 During this
study, we noticed that the AAC reaction of 1,2;5,6-di-O-isopropylidene-3-O-propargyl-3-azido-d-glucofuranose IXd in the presence or absence of solvent
occurred spontaneously at ambient temperature to afford morpholine-fused
1,2,3,-triazole moiety spirocyclic with d-gluco-furanose 5 in 89% yield. We thought of exploiting the same intermediate 5, by suitable manipulation of 5,6- and 1,2-O-isopropylidene groups of d-gluco-furanose, for the synthesis
of targeted spiro-iminosugars.

Figure 2 Catalyst-free AAC reaction in IXa–d.

As shown in Scheme 1, selective deprotection of 5,6-O-isopropylidene
group in 5 with AcOH/H2O (3:2) at 60 °C
afforded diol 6. The primary hydroxyl group in 6 was protected as −OTs group using
Bu2SnO and TsCl in triethylamine to get 7,
which on nucleophilic displacement of C6–OTs group with NaN3 in dimethylformamide (DMF) afforded
C6– azido compound 8 in 89% yield. In the next
step, hydrolysis of 1,2-O-isopropylidene group in 8 with TFA/H2O (3:1) at 0 °C gave an anomeric
mixture of hemiacetal (as evident from the 1H NMR of crude
product), which on intramolecular reductive aminocyclization under
hydrogenation condition, using 10% Pd/C in methanol at 80 psi pressure,
gave azepine iminosugar spiro-linked with the morpholine-fused 1,2,3-triazole 1 in 71% yield.

For the synthesis of spiro-iminosugar 2, it is necessary
to remove anomeric C1 carbon atom in compound 8, for
which it is necessary to protect C5–OH group
with benzyl derivative. Thus, 8 was reacted with NaH
and benzyl bromide in THF to get 6-azido 5-benzyloxy derivative 9 (Scheme 1). Hydrolysis of 1,2-acetonide in 9 with TFA/H2O (3:1) followed by treatment with NaIO4 in acetone/H2O (8:2) and intramolecular reductive aminocyclization of C6–
azido group with C2– formyl group using H2 in 10%
Pd/C at 120 psi afforded piperidine iminosugar spiro-linked with morpholine-fused
1,2,3-triazole 2 in 68% yield.

The synthesis of
iminosugar 3a started from the diol 6. Thus,
reaction of 6 with NaIO4 in
acetone/H2O (8:2) at 0 °C to RT followed by treatment
with NaBH4 in MeOH at 0 °C afforded d-xylofuranose
derivative 10 (Scheme 2). Compound 10 was treated with TsCl in
pyridine to give −OTs derivative 11, which on nucleophilic displacement using NaN3 in DMF
afforded C5– azido compound 12. Finally, hydrolysis
of 1,2-acetonide group in 12 with TFA/H2O
(3:1) followed by intramolecular aminocyclization using H2 in 10% Pd/C at 100 psi afforded 3a in 86% yield. In
general, the N-alkylated derivatives of iminosugars showed enhanced
glycosidase inhibitory activity compared to their parent iminosugars.25 Thus, reaction of 3a with different
alkyl bromides (alkyl = ethyl, butyl, hexyl, octyl, decyl, and dodecyl)
in the presence of K2CO3 in DMF at 80 °C
afforded corresponding N-alkyl derivatives 3b–g in good yield (Scheme 2).

10% Pd/C, H2, 120 psi, 24 h, RT, 78%.

Iminosugar 4a was prepared from compound 6 (Scheme 2). Thus,
selective protection of C6– primary hydroxy functionality in 6 with TBDMSCl in the presence of imidazole in dry dichloromethane
afforded C6–OTBDMS compound 13. Reaction of 13 with triflic anhydride in Et3N in dry dichloromethane
afforded C5–OTf derivative, which was directly
treated with NaN3 in DMF to get C5– azido derivative 14 with inversion of configuration at C5, as evident from
the 1H NMR spectrum (J4,5 =
1.5 Hz in l-ido derivative against J4,5 = 6.0 Hz in d-gluco derivative in 13). Finally, cleavage of 1,2-acetonide group in 14 with
TFA/H2O (3:1) and intramolecular reductive aminocyclization
with H2 in 10% Pd/C in MeOH at 120 psi and room temperature
afforded 4a in 78% yield. N-Alkylations of 4a with alkyl bromides (alkyl = ethyl, butyl, hexyl, octyl, decyl,
and dodecyl) using K2CO3 in DMF at 60 °C
afforded N-alkyl iminosugars 4b–g, respectively (Scheme 2).

Conformational Analysis for 2, 3a–g, and 4a–g
It is
known that six-membered piperidine iminosugars exist in 4C1 or 1C4 conformations, depending on the substituents present on the
ring.26 These conformations play a key
role in deciding the binding property of iminosugars with enzymes
rendering the glycosidase inhibition activity.27 In view of this fact, conformational aspects of newly synthesized
spiro-linked iminosugars 2, 3a–g, and 4a–g were studied
using 1H NMR spectroscopy at neutral pH. In case of iminosugar 2, the assignment of H3 and H4 proton signals was difficult
as these protons were obscured in the deuterated water (HOD). To resolve
the spectra, we studied the temperature-dependent 1H NMR
spectrum of 2 in D2O as the HOD signal at
δ 4.85 and 22 °C is known to shift upfield with increasing
the temperature, and at 72 °C, it appears at δ 4.30.28 Therefore, the 1H NMR spectrum of 2 in D2O was recorded at different temperatures
of 22, 32, 52, and 72 °C (Figure S13). At 72 °C, the doublet at δ 4.72 with J = 3.2 Hz was assigned to H3 and a narrow multiplate at δ 4.20
was assigned to H4 on the basis of the DEPT-135, 1H–1H COSY, and 1H–13C HSQC NMR techniques
(Figures S14–S16). The protons appearing
at δ 3.10 (dd, J = 14.4, 1.5 Hz, 1H) and δ
2.97 (dd, J = 14.4, 2.0 Hz, 1H) were assigned to
H5e and H5a, respectively. Other signals were unchanged, indicating
no change in the conformation of 2 even at high temperature.
With these 1H NMR data, two conformations 4C1 and 1C4 were considered for compound 2. The coupling constants
between H5a (axial) and H4 and between H4 and H3 are decisive in determining
the conformation.

In the 1H NMR spectrum of 2, a small coupling constant value between H5a/H5e and H4
(J ≈ 1.7 Hz) indicated the cis-relative stereochemistry
with the equatorial orientation of H4 (Figure 3). In accordance with this, H3 (axial) appeared
as a doublet with a small coupling constant value (J4,5 = 3.2 Hz), showing cis-relative stereochemistry between
H3 and H4. On the basis of these data, the 1C4 conformation was assigned to spiro-iminosugar 2 (Figure 3). The single crystal for 2 was developed in CHCl3/MeOH, and X-ray crystallographic analysis supported the 1C4 conformation (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Conformations of spiro-iminosugars 2, 3a–g, and 4a–g and ORTEP diagram of 2 and 3a.

The spiro-linked iminosugar 3a is symmetric. Therefore,
H1 and H5 protons (both axial and equatorial) as well as H2 and H4
protons are identical. The equivalent H1a and H5a showed dd at δ
2.84 with J = 13.4 and 10.8 Hz. The large coupling
constant of 10.8 Hz between H1a and H2 or between H5a and H4 requires
axial orientation of both H2 and H4 protons with trans-relative stereochemistry,
thus suggesting the 4C1 conformation
to 3a (Figure 3). The single crystal of 3a (Figure 3) was obtained in CHCl3/MeOH, and X-ray crystallographic study supported the 4C1 conformation. The N-alkyl derivatives
of 3a, namely, 3b–g also
showed 4C1 conformation analogous
to parent compound 3a on the basis of their nearly identical J values (Figure 3).

In case of spiro-linked iminosugar 4a, the H1a (axial)
proton appeared at δ 3.07 as a dd (Figure 3) with J = 14.8 and 3.3
Hz and H1e was observed at δ 3.60 as dd with J = 14.4 and 3.3 Hz. Accordingly, H2 appeared at as a triplet with J = 3.3 Hz. The small coupling constant value between H1a
and H2 requires equatorial orientation of H2 (cis-relative stereochemistry),
thus accounting for the 1C4 conformation of compound 4a. This fact is further supported
by H4, which appeared as a doublet at δ 4.11 with small J4,5 = 2.6 Hz, indicating equatorial orientation
of H4. We presume that the 1C4 conformation is stabilized due to the equatorial orientation of
CH2OH as well as intramolecular H-bonding between the C2
and C4–OH groups, as shown in Figure 3. In case of N-alkyl derivatives 4b–g, we noticed the change in conformation
(Figure 3) as H1a appeared
as dd with J ≈ 12.9 and ≈ 8.0 Hz. The
large coupling constant between H1a and H2 requires relative trans-diaxial
orientation suggesting 4C1 conformation.

The conformational preferences were supported by the DFT calculations.
Thus, DFT-optimized geometries of conformations 1C4/4C1 for compounds 3a, 3c, 4a,
and 4c were subjected for hydrogen-bonding interaction
analysis (Table S1) and are represented
in Figure 4.c

Figure 4 Geometrically DFT-optimized conformations of 3a, 3c, 4a, and 4c and their
energies.

As shown in Figure 4a, the adopted 4C1 conformation
of 3a that is stabilized by intramolecular O6···H–O4,
N3···H–O2, and O2···H–C6
hydrogen-bonding interactions was found to be energetically more stable
by −5.64 kcal/mol over its 1C4 conformation. In 4C1 conformation, the O6···H–O4 interaction was
found to be strong as compared to 1C4 conformation. Further, the weak interactions between N3···H–C2
and N3···H–C4 provided additional stability
to 4C1 conformation. Similarly,
N-butyl analogue 3c also adopted the same 4C1 conformation, which is stable by −9.41
kcal/mol as compared to its 1C4 conformation (Figure 4b, Table S1). This conformation was stabilized
by hydrogen-bonding interactions between O6···H–O4,
N3···H–O2, and N3···H–C2.

In case of compound 4a, the DFT-optimized 1C4 conformation, which is stabilized
by O7···H–O4, O4···H–O2,
O6···H–N1, and N1···H–O2
interactions (Figure 4c), was found to be more stable by −4.39 kcal/mol as compared
to the 4C1 conformation. The
preference of bulkier C6 hydroxy methylene group toward the equatorial
orientation (that avoids 1,3-diaxial steric interactions) might be
contributing in stability of 1C4 conformation by lowering its energy. However, the optimized geometry
of N-butyl derivative 4c was adopted 4C1 conformation, which is more
stable by −6.90 kcal/mol over its 1C4 (Figure 4d). The preference of 4C1 conformation
was supported by strong H-bonding between O7···H–O4,
O4···H–O6, and N3···H–O2
and by weak N3···H–C2, N3···H–C4,
and O2···H–C4 interactions. This leads to axial
orientation of hydroxy methylene group, which is stabilized by the
O4···H–O6 interaction in 4c.

Biological Activities
Glycosidase Inhibitory Activity
The newly synthesized
spiro-iminosugars (1, 2, 3a–g, and 4a–g) were evaluated for their inhibitory activity against a number of
commercially available glycosidases, such as α-glucosidase (rice)
[E.C.3.2.1.20], β-glucosidase (rice) [E.C.3.2.1.21], α-galactosidase
(bovine liver) [E.C.3.2.1.22], β-galactosidase (bovine liver,
cytosolic) [E.C.3.2.1.23], and α-mannosidase (Jack beans) [E.C.3.2.1.24],
with reference to known standards, namely, miglitol (N-hydroxyethyl 1-deoxynojirimycin, trade name Glycet) and 1-deoxynojirimycin
(DNJ). The corresponding IC50 values and inhibition constants
(Ki) were determined from Lineweaver–Burk
plots (Figures S55–S59), and the
results are summarized in Table 1. The six-membered (piperidine) and seven-membered
(azepine) iminosugars are known to be α-glucosidase inhibitors
among various glycosidases, and the same trend was noticed with 1, 2, 3a–g,
and 4a–g that showed good to potent
inhibition of α-glucosidase. In addition, compounds 1, 2, 3a–g, and 4a–g were found to be selective inhibitors
of α-glucosidase (Table 1), wherein the spiro-iminosugar 2 (IC50 = 0.159 and Ki = 0.129 μM) was
found to be a weak inhibitor of α-glucosidase, whereas 4a (IC50 = 0.036 and Ki = 0.033 μM) was found to a better inhibitor of α-glucosidase
than miglitol (IC50 = 0.1 and Ki = 0.081 μM). This fact could be attributed to the synergetic
effect of two pharmacophores, namely, iminosugar and 1,2,3-triazole
(known to be α-glucosidase inhibitor).29

From Table 1, it
is evident that the α-glucosidase inhibitory activity of N-alkylated
iminosugars 3b–g and 4b–g was significantly improved as compared to
their parent compounds 3a and 4a, respectively.
At the same time, N-alkylated compounds 3b–g/4b–g were found to inhibit
other enzymes in a micromolar range (Table 1) and suggest fall in selectivity of enzyme
inhibition for them in contrast to 3a and 4a, respectively. Elongation of alkyl chain from ethyl to dodecyl,
however, showed decrease in α-glucosidase inhibition with each
higher homologue of alkyl chain.

Antifungal Activity
The use of 1,2,3-triazole moiety
in advanced antifungal drug designing provided a platform to synthesize
new antifungal agents containing 1,2,3-triazole pharmacophore.30 In view of this, we have investigated the spiro-iminosugars 1, 2, 3a–g,
and 4a–g for their antifungal activities
against C. albicans in comparison to
a well-known marketed antifungal drug, namely, amphotericine b, recommended
for infection of C. albicans (Table 2). The MIC value of 3a (0.85 μg/mL) is found to be less than that of amphotericine
b (1.25 μg/mL), whereas the value of 4a (0.025
μg/mL) was found to be ∼50 times higher active than that
of amphotericine b. Compounds 1 (2.5 μg/mL) and 2 (1.25 μg/mL) are, respectively, either weak or comparatively
active with the marketed drug.

(MIC) values in μg/mL.

Among N-alkylated derivatives, compound 4c (MIC =
0.025 μg/mL) was found to be comparably active to parent molecule 4a, whereas compound 4d (MIC = 0.020 μg/mL)
showed higher activity than 4a. The MIC values of compounds 3b–g (Table 2) are higher than those of amphotericine
b (1.25 μg/mL), whereas for 4b–g, various MIC values are found. Compounds 4b and 4e–g (MIC > 1.25 μg/mL) are weakly
or less active than 4a. Thus, all other N-alkyl derivatives
(except 4b and 4c) were found to be less
antifungal than their parent compounds. The confocal images of all
screened compounds showed aggregation of the molecules at the fungal
cell surface and exhibited cell wall disruption (Figure 5).

Molecular Docking Studies
Glycosidases and Ligand
Interactions
The observed biological
activities were supported by molecular docking studies. Thus, molecular
interaction of inhibitor molecules with rice α-glucosidase was
analyzed by docking studies. Binding scores of synthesized spiro-iminosugars
(1, 2, 3a–g, and 4a–g) are illustrated in Table S3 and binding poses on the active site
of α-glucosidase (rice) enzyme are shown in Figure 6. Corroboration of binding
free energies with the inhibition kinetic studies indicated that among
synthesized compounds, molecules 1, 2, 3a, and 4a are potent competitive inhibitors
of rice α-glucosidase. All screened molecules with their respective
conformations (1C4 or 4C1 for piperidine iminosugars)
form favorable contacts with binding pocket of α-glucosidase.
Analysis of polar contacts and other weak interactions (electrostatic
and π-interaction) of these compounds showed that the higher
binding affinity is presumably attributed to the formation of higher
number of stable intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the reactive
group of compounds and ASP204, ILE205, SER469, ARG473, ASN477, and
LYS478 at the binding site of the enzyme (Figure 6). However, several π-alkyl interactions
observed between ligand aromatic ring and interacting residues of
enzyme assist polar interaction. In case of N-alkyl derivatives 3b–g and 4b–g, it has been observed that binding of these ligands with
enzyme was unfavorable as compared to the parental compounds (Table S3). This suggests that addition of N-alkyl
chain to 3a and 4a reduces the number of
interactions with binding site residues. As a result, changes in functional
group lead to differential interactions with binding pocket of enzyme.
Minute deviation in biological activity with respect to molecular
docking observations might be due to variations in ligand conformation,
in vitro assay condition, solvation of ligand, and ligand charge state.

Molecular Docking Studies for Antifungal Activity
Antifungal
potential of spiro-iminosugars (1, 2, 3a, 4a, 4c, and 4d)
was analyzed using a docking simulation in relation with amphotericine
b as a positive control. The positive binding energy (10.5 kcal/mol)
for amphotericine b suggests that its interaction with ergosterol
is predominated by unfavorable interaction over favorable contacts
(Figure 7). Analogously,
we have predicted binding of spiro-iminosugars with ergosterol, a
component of fungal cell membranes, which might result in the disruption
of the fungal cell wall and lead to fungal cell death. Compounds 1, 2, and 3a showed approximately
equal binding energies (−1.9, −1.8, and −1.8
kcal/mol) with ergosterol, whereas the highest binding energy of −2.2
kcal/mol was noticed for compound 4a. All compounds exhibited
π-alkyl interaction as shown in Figure 7. The N-alkylated derivatives 4c (B.E. −2.4 kcal/mol) and 4d (B.E. −2.6
kcal/mol) (Figure 7) exhibit strong binding with ergosterol as compared to their parent
compound 4a. This increase in binding energy in derivatives 4c and 4d than their parent iminosugar 4a is in agreement with the in vitro antifungal data (Table 2).

of cell wall of C. albicans (binding
energy (B.E.) is in kcal/mol).

Conclusions
In conclusion, the AAC
reaction of 3-O-propargyl-3-azido-d-glucofuranose
derivative (IXd) gave adduct 5 that was
used as a common intermediate, by judicious manipulation
of the 1,2- and 5,6-O-isopropylidene groups, in the
synthesis of library of spiro-iminosugars (1, 2, 3a–g, and 4a–g) linked with the 1,2,3-triazole-fused
morpholine. The presence of two pharmacophores, such as iminosugar
and triazole, showed dual biological activity. In addition, the synergetic
effect of two pharmacophores led to augmentation of the glycosidase
inhibitory as well as antifungal activity. Among 16 examples, the
spiro-iminosugars 3a and 4a were found to
be more potent inhibitors of α-glucosidase than miglitol as
well as showed high antifungal activity against C.
albicans than amphotericin b. The N-alkyl derivatives
showed increase of α-glucosidase inhibition and enhancement
of antifungal activity as compared to their respective parent iminosugar.
Thus, the synthesized spiro-iminosugars may open a new era of potential
chimeric drugs in comorbidity treatments.

Experimental Section
General
Methods for Synthesis
Melting points were recorded
using Thomas–Hoover melting point apparatus and are uncorrected.
IR spectra were recorded with an FTIR spectroscope as a thin film
or using KBr pellets and are expressed in cm–1. 1H NMR (300, 400, or 500 MHz) and 13C NMR (100 or
125 MHz) spectra were recorded using CDCl3, CD3OD, or D2O as solvent(s). Chemical shifts were reported
in δ unit (parts per million) with reference to TMS as an internal
standard, and coupling constant (J) values were given
in Hertz. Optical rotations were measured using a polarimeter at 22
°C. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were obtained in positive-ion
electrospray ionization (ESI) mode using time-of-flight analyzer.
Thin-layer chromatography was performed on precoated plates (0.25
mm, silica gel 60 F254). Column chromatography was carried out with
silica gel (100–200 mesh). Reactions were carried out in oven-dried
glassware under dry N2 atmosphere. Methanol, dichloromethane,
and THF were purified and dried according to reported methods. Petroleum
ether (PE) was a distillation fraction between 40 and 60 °C.
The 10% Pd/C was purchased from Aldrich. After neutralization, workup
involves washing of combined organic layer with water and brine, drying
over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and evaporating the solvent under reduced
pressure, followed by vacuum drying.

Conformational Analysis Protocol for DFT Method
To
investigate conformational preferences of compounds 3a, 3c, 4a, and 4c and to corroborate
our NMR experimental observations, we have performed quantum chemical
calculations using the density functional theory (DFT) method. The
initial geometries (2C5 and 5C2 conformations) for compounds 3a and 3c and (1C4 and 4C1 conformations)
for compounds 4a and 4c have been generated
using molecular modeling Spartan’14 software (wavefunction.in).
Automated complete geometry optimizations were performed using the
DFT method by employing B3LYP/6-31 G** basic set function on Spartan’14
software. Pictorial presentations of DFT-optimized geometries of compounds
have been made using Mercury 3.7 software.

Methodology Used for Biological
Activities
Glycosidase Inhibitory Activity
Glycosidase inhibition
assay for compounds 1, 2, 3a–g, and 4a–g was carried out by mixing 0.1 U cm–3 each of α-,β-glucosidase,
α-,β-galactosidase, and α-mannosidase, and the samples
were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Enzyme action for α/β-galactosidase
was initiated by addition of 10 mM p-nitrophenyl-α-/β-d-galactopyranoside (pNPG) as a substrate in
200 mM sodium acetate buffer. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C
for 10 min and stopped by adding 2 cm3 of 200 mM borate
buffer of pH 9.8. α-Mannosidase activity was initiated by addition
of 10 mM p-nitrophenyl-α-d-mannopyranoside
as a substrate in 100 mM citrate buffer of pH 4.5. The reaction was
incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and stopped by adding 2 cm3 of 200 mM borate buffer of pH 9.8. Initiation of α-glucosidase
activity was done by addition of 10 mM p-nitrophenyl-α-d-glucopyranoside in 100 mM phosphate buffer of pH 6.8 and stopped
by adding 2 cm3 of 0.1 M Na2CO3 after
an incubation of 10 min at 37 °C. Glycosidase activity was determined
by measuring absorbance of the p-nitrophenol released
from pNPG at 420 nm using Molecular Devices Spectramax
M5 mulitmode plate reader. One unit of glycosidase activity is defined
as the amount of enzyme that hydrolyzed 1 mM of p-nitrophenyl pyranoside per minute under assay condition.

Inhibition
constant (Ki) values were determined by
spectrophotometrically measuring the residual hydrolytic activities
of the glycosidases in the presence of compounds. Each assay was performed
in the appropriate buffer at the optimal pH for the enzymes. The reactions
were initiated by addition of enzyme to a solution of the substrate
in the absence or presence of various concentrations of inhibitor.
Approximate values of Ki were determined
using a fixed concentration of substrate (around the KM value for the different glycosidases) and various concentrations
of inhibitor. Full Ki determinations and
enzyme inhibition mode were determined from the slope of Lineweaver–Burk
plots and double reciprocal analysis.

Antifungal Activity
Minimal
Inhibition Concentration (MIC) Assay
Fungal strains Candida albicans NCIM 3557
were procured from National Chemical Lab, Repository. Using the multipipette
dispense, 100 μL of LB medium was dispensed in all wells of
microliter plate. The plate and lid were labeled, and 100 μL
of 2× antibiotic solutions was pipette into wells in column 1.
Using the multipipette set at 100 μL, the antibiotics were mixed
into the wells of column 1 by sucking up and down six to seven times.
A volume of 100 μL from column 1 was withdrawn and added to
column 2. This made column 2 a twofold dilution of column 1, column
3 a twofold dilution of column 3, and so on. Similar procedure was
repeated for the test compounds 1, 2, 3a–g, and 4a–g. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 24 h and scanned
with an ELISA plate reader. All experiments were run in triplicate,
and standard deviations were determined.

Bright-Field Images
Candida albicans
SC5314
strain obtained from MTCC (National Chemical Lab, Pune) was inoculated
in six-well sterile plates. The glass slides were made grease-free
thoroughly. Each compound (5 μL) in its subinhibitory concentration
was added to each well along with control. Compounds 1, 2, 3a–g, and 4a–g were added and incubated at 37 °C
for 24 h. The cells were treated and fixed using 2% paraformaldehyde.
The glass slides were washed with 1× PBS buffer and imaged using
confocal microscopy.

Methodology Used for Docking Studies
Three dimensional
(3D) models of rice α/β glucosidase, rice α/β
galactosidase, and Jack bean α-mannosidase were built by comparative
modeling using MODELER 9 v4.31 Crystallographic
structures of homologous protein were considered as a template to
predict the structures of enzymes, which were further assessed by
the Ramachandran plot analysis. Structures of enzymes and synthesized
molecules were energy-minimized using GROMOS43B1 energy field. Receptor
and ligand molecules were prepared for docking simulation by adding
hydrogens and assigning Kollman charges. Likewise, the ligands were
established by assigning the Gasteiger charges and nonpolar hydrogens.
Structures of receptor and ligand are converted from pdb to pdbqt
format using AutoDock 4.2.32 Grid was set
around the active site of enzymes with a dimension of 20 × 20
× 20 Å3 using Autogrid module of Autodock program.
Binding score was calculated by the Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA),
which uses a set of 30 structurally known protein–ligand complexes
with experimentally determined binding constants to calibrate empirical
free-energy functions. Parameters were set to the LGA calculation
of 10 000 runs, whereas energy evaluations were set to 1 500 000
and 27 000 generations (repetition of process). The obtained
docked poses and intermolecular interactions were gathered and analyzed
using PyMol visualize (PyMol Molecular Graphics System, version 1.2r3
pre, Schrodinger LLC).

drug is artemisnin–quinine conjugate hybrid drug, which is
more effective against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant malaria than
the individual drugs.
