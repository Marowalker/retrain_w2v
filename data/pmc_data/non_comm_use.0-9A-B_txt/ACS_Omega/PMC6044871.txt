Addressing
the limitations associated with the detection of cholesterol,
we present a one-pot synthesis of a carbon nanodot (CD) in an organic
medium (CDorg) from a novel bile acid hydrazone-based organogel.
Interestingly, CDorg possesses the aggregation-induced
emission enhancement (AIEE) phenomenon, which rationally aids in the
“enzyme-free” detection of cholesterol through a fluorescence
turn-on mechanism. On dilution of the THF/water mixture of CDorg with its poor solvent (water), a 9.8-fold enhancement in
its photoluminescence (PL) emission is witnessed. Such an enhancement
in PL emission is credited to the occurrence of molecular restrictions
due to the formation of nanoaggregates of CDorg, thereby
initiating a radiative pathway for exciton decay. Excitingly on adding
cholesterol to CDorg, we observed a similar enhancement
in its PL emission without the use of any cholesterol oxidase (ChOx) enzyme. The limit of detection and limit of
quantification of cholesterol is found to be as low as 1.09 and 3.64
μM, respectively. Hence, this contribution highlights the enzyme-free
fluorescence turn-on detection of cholesterol by a novel CD rationally
designed to extend its applicability in an organic medium, where it
is still considered a major restraint.

Introduction
Detection of cholesterol
(a major component of the mammalian cell
membrane) has always been an expensive task considering the crucial
involvement of the cholesterol oxidase (ChOx) enzyme to catalyze the oxidation of cholesterol to 4-cholesten-3-one
and hydrogen peroxide.1−4 In addition to cost-ineffectiveness, ChOx is prone to denaturation. Moreover, cholesterol is associated with
solubility issues in an aqueous medium, limiting its detection to
a great extent. Knowing the fact that a cholesterol concentration
level higher than 5.17 mM in the human blood1 may increase the risk for atherosclerosis, thrombosis, myocardial
infarction, and many lipid-related ailments, regular monitoring of
cholesterol in the blood is very crucial to human health. Therefore,
a cost-effective, quick, easy to handle sensing probe for cholesterol
is highly desirable.

In view of that, we present here a one-pot
synthesis of fluorescent
carbon nanodots (CDs) from a bile acid-based organogel in an organic
medium (CDorg) to combat the aforementioned issues associated
with the detection of cholesterol. This is the first report on the
synthesis of fluorescent carbon nanoparticles of size less than 10
nm (CDs) using a bile acid hydrazone-based organogel as a precursor,
clearly in contrast to previous reports of bigger carbon nanoparticles
from an organogel.5 CD, a zero-dimensional
carbogenic dot-nanoparticle, joined the versatile nanocarbon family
after fullerene, carbon nanotubes, and graphene, since its inception
by Sun et al.6 in 2006. Possessed by fascinating
virtues, such as particle size less than 10 nm, high chemical stability,
low toxicity, and environmental threat, CD is regarded as a natural
alternative to the conventional quantum dots (QDs), the fluorescent
chalcogenide semiconductor nanocrystals.7 The literature has documented several applications of CD, for instance,
bioimaging,8,9 photocatalysis,10,11 light-emitting devices,12 sensing,13−18 and many more. In the last decade, great progress has been made
in discovering different new precursors for the synthesis of CDs with
unique functionalities.6−15 These precursors, such as graphite oxide, candle soot, and activated
carbon, have mostly carboxyl, hydroxyl, and amidogen functionalities
that make CDs hydrophilic, regulating its easy dispersion in all aqueous
solvents. Scientists have also tried to synthesize hetero-atom (sulfur/nitrogen)
co-doped CDs from hair fibers as a precursor, as well as two-dimensional
graphene QDs.19−21 On the one hand, these virtues have acted in favor
of making CD an alternative to the conventional QDs7 in almost all application fields. On the other hand, the
said hydrophilicity of CDs has limited its usage in the fields demanding
organic medium, like oil-in-water separation, detection of nonaqueous
soluble analytes, which necessitates the presence of active hydrophobic
groups on the surface of CDs. There are very few reports on such CD
systems having organosilane, −CH3, or long aliphatic
carbon chains on their surfaces.22−24 However, none of these
reports demonstrate exclusive synthesis of CDs detailing its application
dedicated to the use of CDs in an organic medium. In addition, all
these methods employ a very high reaction temperature (200 to 300
°C) and longer reaction times (3–28 h). For this reason,
the problems in organic fields are still the same when it comes to
the CD systems.

Taking clue from these literatures, we designed
a simple one-pot
strategy to exclusively synthesize CDs in an organic medium (CDorg) from organogel (Og) in tetrahydrofuran (THF)
in only 1 h at 100 °C, relatively a much lower temperature. A
novel deoxycholic acid-based hydrazone ((4R)-N′-((E)-3,4-bis(dodecyloxy)benzylidene)-4-((3R,10S,12S,13R)-3,12-di-hydroxy-10,13-dimethyl-hexadecahydro-1H-cyclopenta-[a]-phenanthren-17-yl)-pentane-hydrazide, Figure 10) synthesized in our laboratory
was used as the organogelator in preparing Og for the study.
Organogels, as the name suggests, are well-defined three-dimensional
(3D) networks composed of similar helical, fibrous, or lamellar structures
present in a hydrogel but can be prepared only through the gelation
of organic solvents by means of various noncovalent interactions.25,26 Among numerous compounds investigated for organogel formation, the
design of gelators based on bile acids remains a rational choice due
to their detergent nature. Bile acids have a concave α-face
with multiple hydroxyl groups providing them with an amphiphilic nature
that serves as a driving force for their self-assembly to act as a
privileged scaffold for efficient organogelation.27 Reports on bile acid-based organogelators as a template
for the synthesis of metal nanoparticles are scarce.28 Therefore, we have performed an exclusive study on the
synthesis of bile acid-derived organogel-based fluorescent CDorg in THF and in other organic solvents.

lamp image of the solution illuminated under 365 nm.) (b) Dynamic
light scattering (DLS) graph showing particle size distribution of
OgT-CDorg.

Furthermore, CDorg was found to inherit the amazing
aggregation-induced emission enhancement (AIEE) effect in a THF/water
mixture (Scheme 1),
thereby making it the first CD system to have shown this new-found
“AIEE” phenomenon.29−33 We successfully fabricated this AIEE-active CDorg by using THF as the organic solvent and oleylamine (Oam) as the surface passivation agent (Scheme 1). The as-prepared OgTOam-CDorg became nonemissive on dilution in THF, but emitted
strongly in a 40/60 (v/v (%)) THF/water mixture with a 9.8-fold enhancement
in its PL intensity, which is discussed in detail in the Results and Discussion section. AIEE, a phenomenon
quite opposite to the aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) process,
was first observed by Tang et al.34 in
2001. An AIEE system reportedly shows a huge enhancement in its PL
emission intensity in the aggregated or solid state; however, it has
very weak emission in a dilute solution state. Tang et al.34 observed this abnormal phenomenon in a silole-based
organic material, following which hundreds of reports confirmed this
anti-ACQ phenomenon.35−40 The aggregates are in the nanoscale, which fluoresce brighter than
their discrete parts, as per the collective quantity-effect rule.
In principle, the active dynamic motions of molecules with the solvent
media cause friction, transforming photonic energy to thermal energy
resulting in the radiationless relaxation of excitons. Upon formation
of nanoaggregates, these molecular motions get restricted, which activates
the radiative channels for the decay of excitons, thus boosting their
light emissions. A number of factors are found to be responsible for
such restrictions, primarily, hindered intermolecular rotations in
a molecule on aggregation.

Scheme 1 Pictorial Representation of the Formation
of Nanoaggregates of Organic
CDs (OgTOam-CDorg) and Its Application as a Fluorescence Turn-On Sensor
for Enzyme-Free Detection of Cholesterol
Resolutely, we explored this AIEE attribute of the as-prepared
OgTOam-CDorg for an efficient “ChOx enzyme-free” detection of cholesterol
in the human blood serum through the fluorescence turn-on mechanism,
a technique rather simple and easy in comparison to the already reported
techniques.41 The limit of detection (LOD)
and limit of quantification (LOQ) of cholesterol by OgTOam-CDorg were found to be as low as 1.09 and 3.64
μM, respectively. The chemistry between these molecules suggests
that cholesterol molecules coaggregate on their addition to OgTOam-CDorg, resulting in a significant
PL enhancement at λmax = 427 nm. The applicability
of OgTOam-CDorg as a cholesterol
sensor in the human blood serum was also tested, and it showed very
convincing results without the use of any enzyme. This has made OgTOam-CDorg an AIEE phenomenon-based
CD sensing probe for cholesterol, the only one of its kind to date.
Therefore, this contribution is the first detailed successful demonstration
of the synthesis of CDs in an organic medium from a bile acid-based
organogel with the amazing new-found AIEE phenomenon for an enzyme-free
detection of cholesterol through a fluorescence turn-on mechanism.

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis of Organogelator Deoxycholic Acid
Hydrazone-Based
Compound, 5d ((4R)-N′-((E)-3,4-Bis(dodecyloxy)benzylidene)-4-((3R,10S,12S,13R)-3,12-dihydroxy-10,13-dimethylhexadecahydro-1H-cyclopenta-[a]-phenanthren-17-yl)pentane-hydrazide)
With an aim to prepare deoxycholic acid-based low-molecular-weight
gelators, we initiated the synthesis by preparing a deoxycholyl hydrazide
derivative (3) as the first precursor,42 starting from deoxycholic acid (1) via esterification, followed
by hydrazination in ethanol. We then synthesized long-chain appended
alkoxy aldehydes (4c–f) as the second precursors, by coupling
commercially available hydroxyl aldehydes (4a–b) with bromoalkanes
following a reported protocol.43 Finally,
the coupling of 3 and 4 in ethanol under reflux conditions using acetic
acid as a catalyst yielded long-chain appended deoxycholic acid-based
hydrazones (5a–d) in good to excellent yield (Figure 10). All of the final compounds,
5a–d, were completely characterized on the basis of their detailed
spectroscopic studies, such as 1H and 13C NMR,
and the copies of 1H and 13C NMR spectra are
included in the SI (5a–d). Among
5a–d, 5d was used for the preparation of the organogel as a
precursor of CDorg as it showed the best gelation property
with stability at room temperature.

Synthesis and Characterization
of Organic CDs (CDorg) from Organogel
Fluorescent
organic CDs (CDorg) possessing the active AIEE attribute
were prepared from a novel
organogel precursor. The organogel (Og) was prepared in
DMSO from a novel deoxycholic acid hydrazone-based compound, 5d ((4R)-N′-((E)-3,4-bis(dodecyloxy)benzylidene)-4-((3R,10S,12S,13R)-3,12-dihydroxy-10,13-dimethylhexadecahydro-1H-cyclopenta-[a]-phenanthren-17-yl)pentane-hydrazide), synthesized in
our laboratory. The detailed reaction pathway followed for the synthesis
of organogelator 5d is shown in Figure 10. The organogel (Og) which showed
blue fluorescence under a UV lamp (365 nm) was deliberately investigated
as a potential precursor for synthesizing CDs in an organic medium.
Initially, Og was refluxed in THF at an elevated temperature
(100 °C). This solution with a weak blue fluorescence under the
UV lamp (365 nm) showed excitation-dependent PL emission when excited
with λex ∼ 380, 400, 420, 440, 460, 480, and
500 nm (Figure 1a).

The native nature of a CD system, that is, a shift in the emission
wavelength (λem) along with a decrease in the PL
intensity with an increase in λex, was also evident.
Thus, the solution was named as OgT-CDorg. To
study the effect of a solvent on the PL property of the CDorg, a set of four other organic solvents were used to synthesize CDorg from Og, viz., toluene (Tu), n-hexane (Hx), acetonitrile (An), and epichlorohydrin (Ech). The PL
spectra of CDorg prepared in all these solvents were studied
and is detailed in Figure S1 of SI. Of
all of the five CDorg’s prepared in different solvents,
OgT-CDorg showed the best PL property, suggesting
the influential role of different solvents in tuning the PL property
through the electronic construction of CDorg. Considering
the results obtained, OgT-CDorg was chosen as
the organic CD of our interest for the complete study. We also checked
the particle size of OgT-CDorg through the DLS
analysis depicting sizes below 10 nm (Figure 1b), an important criterion of a CD system.

With an aim to enhance the PL intensity of a CD system, the incorporation
of different compounds as a surface passivating agent has been experimented
since the introduction of CDs by Sun et al.6 Therefore, in our organic carbon dot system (OgT-CDorg), the feasible role of any compound for surface passivation
was studied. Oleylamine (Oam) is famously known as a coordinating
ligand for the synthesis of many nanoparticles.44 Its terminal −NH2 group makes it a perfect
ligand for several metal-based nanosystems. Here, the novelty of Oam in passivating the surface of an organic CD system was investigated.
The OgTOam-CDorg was prepared by
refluxing Og in a 9:1 ratio solution of THF/Oam at 100 °C, and its PL emission was studied at λex ∼ 380, 400, 420, 440, 460, 480, and 500 nm (Figure 2a). A noteworthy 2.4-fold enhancement
in the PL intensity of OgTOam-CDorg confirmed the fact that the surface of CDorg was successfully
passivated by the Oam molecules. It should be noted that
the passivation agent (Oam) contains no chromophore and
therefore the observed enhancement in PL must be attributable to the
surface passivated OgTOam-CDorg.
A DLS analysis to quantify the particle size of OgT-CDorg and OgTOam-CDorg was also
performed. The presence of particles of sizes less than 10 nm in the
DLS graph of both the CDorg systems (Figure 2b) satisfied this essential property of a
CD system.

(Inset: The UV lamp image of the solution illuminated under 365 nm.)
(b) DLS graph showing particle size distribution of OgTOam-CDorg.

The investigation of any morphological change from a microscale
in the organogel to a nanoscale in CDorg was done through
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging, as depicted in Figure 3. The freeze-dried
organogel (Og) showed a lamellar packing (fibrous network
of microstructures), which changed to dotlike nanoparticles through
a one-pot reflux in THF at elevated temperatures in OgT-CDorg. Such type of morphological changes could be partially
credited to a lowering in the surface free energy of the molecule
in the gel-to-solution course of the reaction. After passivation with
Oam, a uniform and dense distribution of the dotlike nanoparticles
(size ≤10 nm) was observed in OgTOam-CDorg. In addition, an absence of precipitation from the OgTOam-CDorg suspension was noticed even
after 6 months of its storage at 4 °C, which reflected its outstanding
colloidal stability. All of these analyses thereby validated that
Oam could be a prospective passivation agent in an organic
CD system.

prepared in THF (OgT-CDorg) and THF/Oam (OgTOam-CDorg).

Following this, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) was employed
to study the surface element composition of OgT-CDorg and OgTOam-CDorg. The
findings so obtained (Figure 4a,b) showed three peaks typical of C 1s at 285 eV, N 1s at
400 eV, and O 1s at 531 eV. The content ratio of these peaks in OgTOam-CDorg was 92.02, 2.23, and 5.08%,
whereas in OgT-CDorg it was 93.52, 1.52, and
4.18%, respectively. Clearly, a higher % of nitrogen is indicative
of the presence of oleylamine as the surface passivation agent in
OgTOam-CDorg. Furthermore, the high-resolution
XPS spectra (Figure 4c–h) gave the information about the elemental states of all
of the bands of C 1s, N 1s, and O 1s on deconvolution. C 1s of OgTOam-CDorg could be deconvoluted into
two peaks at 285.03 eV assigned to C–C/C=C and 284.23
assigned to C–O/C–N groups present on the surface. In
OgT-CDorg, two peaks at 285.15 eV (C–OH/C–O–C)
and 284.67 eV (C=O) were obtained from its C 1s XPS band. Similarly,
for the N 1s band of OgTOam-CDorg, two deconvoluted peaks at 401.05 and 399.29 eV representing −C–N–N
(hydrazone moiety) and C–NH (oleylamine), respectively, were
obtained; however, in OgT-CDorg, only one peak
at 401.41 eV (−C–N–N, the hydrazone moiety) could
be obtained from its N 1s band. In contrast, for the O 1s band, two
deconvoluted peaks were observed at 532.39 and 531.08 eV in OgTOam-CDorg and 532.37 and 531.65 eV
in OgT-CDorg assigned to C–OH/C–O–C
and C=O, respectively. Thus, the above data including SEM,
PL, and DLS provide a comprehensive demonstration on the successful
synthesis of CDorg in comparison to others reports.22−24

AIEE Attribute of Organic
CDs
Interestingly, OgTOam-CDorg was found to be an AIEE-active
candidate. To study this behavior, the solution of OgTOam-CDorg was prepared in THF/water mixtures with
different fractions (0–90% (v/v)) of water, a poor solvent
for the organic CDs. The changes in the PL intensity were monitored
at an excitation wavelength, λex ∼ 380 nm
(maximum PL intensity), and are shown in Figure 5a. As evident, 50 μL of the OgTOam-CDorg solution on dilution in TOam (THF/Oam = 9:1, good solvent for CDorg) was
almost nonemissive, showing a weak PL intensity with very low blue
fluorescence under a UV lamp (365 nm). However, when water was added
into it as a poor solvent, an instant enhancement in its PL intensity
was observed. This PL intensity of OgTOam-CDorg invigorated at 30% of water fraction in the THF/water mixture
with a 2.5-fold enhancement, which reached its maximum value showing
a 9.8-fold increase at 60% fraction of water and also a bright blue
fluorescence under a 365 nm UV lamp (Figure 5b). Any addition of more % of water to the
THF/water mixture resulted in a decrease in the PL intensity well-reflected
in their UV lamp fluorescence images.

mixture. (b) Fluorescence
images of the solutions under a UV lamp of 365 nm. (c) Pictorial representation
showing a plausible mechanism for PL emission in OgTOam-CDorg on dilution with a poor solvent (water)
due to the “AIEE effect”.29,45−47

In OgT-CDorg, the rotation of the N–N
single bond seemed quite feasible because of which very low PL emission
was observed.33 As Oam was added,
the viscosity of the solvent increased, thereby inducing restriction
of such rotational motions of the N–N single bond in OgTOam-CDorg. These restrictions, in turn,
restricted the nonradiative emissions and initiated the radiative
processes. Hence, this has explained well the role of Oam as a surface passivation agent in the CDorg system resulting
in its enhanced PL intensity. In addition, the designation of OgTOam-CDorg as an AIEE system could be
easily verified by the experiment performed in Figure 5. The dilution of OgTOam-CDorg in THF (a good solvent for CDorg) lowered
the viscosity of the medium and thus became almost nonemissive.29,45−47 On addition of water (a poor solvent for CDorg) to the medium, the formation of OgTOam-CDorg aggregates commenced. With more fraction of water (30–70%
(v/v)), OgTOam-CDorg clustered to
form nanoaggregates (Figure 6) owing to its poor solubility; thereby, its PL intensity
dramatically increased confirming the presence of an AIEE effect in
OgTOam-CDorg.

Figure 6 SEM image of OgTOam-CDorg showing
the formation of nanoaggregates in a 40/60(%) THF/water mixture.

Thus, we can say here that, to
the best of our knowledge, OgTOam-CDorg is the first reported bile
acid-based CD system (in an organic or aqueous medium) to successfully
show an AIEE effect. In addition, it can be noted that the organogelator
was nonemissive in the solution state but became emissive on forming
an organogel (Og) with DMSO. This could be due to restriction
of energy-consuming motions on gelation owing to intermolecular H-bonding
and obvious physical constraints.29 The
Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectrum of Og (Figure 7) supported these
facts, showing a broader peak around 3447 cm–1 and
also a sharp and large peak at 1033 cm–1 of −S=O
rather than several peaks around 1033 cm–1 in the
FTIR spectrum of the organogelator (Figure 7). Therefore, when gelation occurred, all
of these interactions allowed a radiative emission pathway, rendering
its fluorescence under a 365 nm UV lamp, as stated above.

Enzyme-Free Detection of Cholesterol by OgTOam-CDorg through Fluorescence Turn-On: An AIEE Effect
The applicability of the AIEE attribute possessed by OgTOam-CDorg was explored further to show its
potential as an enzyme-free sensing probe for cholesterol detection
through a systematic study. At first, a 0.1 mM solution of cholesterol
(Chl) was prepared in THF for the analysis. Interestingly, on adding
100 μL of Chl solution to 1 mL of OgTOam-CDorg, an instant increase in its PL intensity was observed.
This increase in the PL intensity got enhanced on gradual addition
of more 0.1 mM Chl solution. To determine the sensitivity of the study,
0.5 mM, 1 μM, and 0.5 μM solutions of Chl were prepared
and added into the OgTOam-CDorg solution
in a stepwise manner. OgTOam-CDorg showed a progressive increase in its PL intensity upon addition
of Chl solutions of different concentrations. To quantify the net
level of cholesterol responsible in triggering this turn-on in the
PL intensity of OgTOam-CDorg, the
concentration of cholesterol in the cuvette was calculated for every
volume of cholesterol solution added to it. As depicted in Figure 8a, the minimum increase
in the PL intensity was observed in the presence of 0.12 μM
cholesterol, below which no change in the PL intensity was evident.
We studied this enhancement in the PL intensity up to an in-cuvette
cholesterol concentration of 0.50 mM showing a ∼2-fold enhancement
in the PL intensity of OgTOam-CDorg (Figure 8a).

Figure 8 (a) PL spectra
showing turn-on fluorescence sensing in the presence
of cholesterol (Chl) concentrations of 0.05 μM to 0.5 mM. (b)
Linearly fitted calibration plot of relative PL intensity (I/I0 at 427 nm) vs the concentration
of cholesterol (Chl) from 0.05 μM to 0.5 mM (inset: linear equation
and regression (R2) value estimated from
the plot).

Clearly, the as-prepared
OgTOam-CDorg possesses analytical
characteristics to detect different levels
of cholesterol through an easy turn-on in its PL intensity with an
important advantage, viz., the cholesterol sensor is devoid of the
expensive cholesterol oxidase enzyme, making it superior in comparison
to the already reported sensors for cholesterol. The relative PL intensity
(I/I0) of OgTOam-CDorg at 427 nm versus the concentration
of Chl is plotted in Figure 8b. Here, “I” denotes the PL
intensity of OgTOam-CDorg at 427
nm on adding 500 μL of Chl solution of different concentrations,
and “I0” denotes the initial
PL of OgTOam-CDorg at 427 nm in the
absence of any Chl solution. Interestingly, the PL intensity of OgTOam-CDorg increased linearly with the
concentration of Chl from 0.05 μM to 0.5 mM with R2 = 0.97153, a value close to 1 validating a good linear
fitting. Accordingly, the LOD and LOQ assessed from the calibration
plot showed a value of 1.09 and 3.64 μM, respectively. Therefore,
it can be said that OgTOam-CDorg has
the potential to serve as a successful fluorescence turn-on sensor
for the enzyme-free detection of cholesterol.

The interaction
of Chl with OgTOam-CDorg could be
explained by the formation of a H-bond between
the Chl moiety and the functional groups present in OgTOam-CDorg. The −OH group in Chl and two −OH
groups, a C=O group, and −NH–N = groups in OgTOam-CDorg were readily available for
intermolecular H-bonding. The FTIR study (Figure 9a) provided the proof of the interaction
between these groups. In OgT-CDorg, the peaks
at 2926 and 2854 cm–1 (νC–H) were intense, signifying the presence of more number of aliphatic
carbon chains on the surface of OgT-CDorg, which
in turn also justified its solubility in an organic solvent.17 In addition, the peaks at 1742 cm–1 (νC=O) and 1667 cm–1 (νC=N) confirmed that the preparative reflux conditions
did not jeopardize the molecular integrity of the organogelator to
form CDorg. As FTIR spectroscopy is an interpretation of
molecular motions, the drastic decrease in the intensity of these
peaks in OgTOam-CDorg gave an indication
of restrictions in molecular motions of these bonds on the addition
of Oam, causing the AIEE effect. The interaction of OgTOam-CDorg with Chl further decreased
the peak intensities, confirming a greater restriction of molecular
motions in the presence of Chl. As these restrictions showed an enhancement
in PL emission, it can be said that Chl molecules formed coaggregates
with OgTOam-CDorg on occurrence of
such H-bonding,29 depicted clearly in its
SEM image (Figure 9b). Consequently, the nonradiative emission of OgTOam-CDorg got suppressed by the radiative decay pathway
showing the enhanced PL emission, as well explained in the Introduction and Results and Discussion sections.

(c) Interference study of OgTOam-CDorg by other biomolecules (glucose, Glu; lactic acid, LaA; ascorbic
acid, AsA).

For any sensing system,
the interference by other molecules could
be a major drawback in the study. Therefore, to check the selectivity
of OgTOam-CDorg for cholesterol,
we conducted an interference analysis with ascorbic acid (AsA), glucose
(Glu), and lactic acid (LaA), taking reference from the previous reports.
For the study, AsA, Glu, and LaA were analyzed by OgTOam-CDorg in a similar manner as that done in Chl.
Interestingly, OgTOam-CDorg did not
show any significant change in its PL intensity in the presence of
0.1 mM solutions of AsA, Glu, and LaA, as evident from Figure 9c. Clearly, this suggests that
OgTOam-CDorg has good control in
its selectivity toward Chl, exclusively.

Cholesterol Sensing in
the Human Blood Serum
The feasibility
of OgTOam-CDorg to successfully serve
as a cholesterol sensing probe in the human blood serum was also tested
to provide a proof-of-concept for its practical applicability. The
sensing analysis was performed on two human blood serum samples collected
from Pratiksha Hospital, Assam, India. An instant enhancement in the
PL intensity of OgTOam-CDorg was
witnessed on the addition of the blood serum to it (Figure S3a). A calibration curve (Figure S3b) plotted to calculate the concentration level of Chl gave
the values of 239 mg/dL and 183 mg/dL for the level of Chl present
in the samples, whose actual values are 201 and 193 mg/dL, respectively
(as reported by the hospital). In conclusion, the results obtained
by our OgTOam-CDorg system gave quite
satisfactory validation regarding its potential to be used as a cheap
cholesterol sensor.

Moreover, this enzyme-free fluorescence
turn-on sensor of cholesterol features several superiorities in comparison
to its contemporary sensors. First, the sensing probe and all the
associated reagents are very simple and cost-effective. Second, our
sensing system does not involve any enzyme for the detection of Chl,
which further lowers the cost and limitations involved in the study
to a larger extent. Third, the sensitivity is found to be very good,
and the interference by other biomolecules is also negligible, making
it a selective and sensitive cholesterol sensor. Convincingly, all
the above stated advantages of this sensing system are the worthy
rewards of the AIEE attribute of OgTOam-CDorg.

Conclusions
In this study, fluorescent
organic CDs (OgTOam-CDorg) possessing
the amazing AIEE attribute were synthesized
from a novel bile acid-based organogel in a quick one-pot strategy.
The organogel (Og) was prepared from a novel deoxycholic
acid hydrazone-based compound ((4R)-N′-((E)-3,4-bis(dodecyloxy)benzylidene)-4-((3R,10S,12S,13R)-3,12-dihydroxy-10,13-dimethylhexadecahydro-1H-cyclopenta-[a]-phenanthren-17-yl)pentane-hydrazide), exclusively synthesized
in our laboratory as a DMSO-gelator. The OgTOam-CDorg was prepared by refluxing Og in a 9:1
ratio solution of THF/oleylamine (TOam) at 100 °C
and 400 rpm under N2 flow, and its PL emission was studied
at λex ∼ 380, 400, 420, 440, 460, 480, and
500 nm. The organic CD, OgTOam-CDorg, was found to possess the AIEE effect in different THF/water (v/v)
mixtures, which was investigated through PL and SEM studies. The maximum
AIEE effect was evident in the 40/60(%) THF/water mixture, which showed
a 9.8-fold increase in the PL intensity and also a bright blue fluorescence
under a 365 nm UV lamp. This could be attributed to the formation
of nanoaggregates of OgTOam-CDorg at the 40/60(%) THF/water mixture causing restrictions in molecular
motions. In doing so, the nonradiative pathway gets limited and the
radiative pathway for the decay of excitons gets initiated, thus offering
an enhancement in the PL emission. The applicability of this AIEE
attribute was explored to show its potential as an enzyme-free fluorescence
turn-on sensor for cholesterol (Chl) with a LOD and LOQ of 1.09 and
3.64 μM, respectively. The enhancement in the PL intensity of
OgTOam-CDorg in the presence of Chl
molecules could also be credited to the formation of nanoaggregates
and consequential radiative decay pathways for excitons. The fluorescence
turn-on Chl detection by OgTOam-CDorg also showed its feasibility in the human blood serum with a minimum
error. Therefore, this AIEE-based organic CD system is a unique fluorescence
material in an organic medium with the most desirable qualities and
an important application of cholesterol sensing in the human blood
serum.

Experimental Section
Materials and Equipment
Dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) (Merck),
THF (Merck), An (Merck), Hx (Merck), Tu (Merck), Ech (Merck), oleylamine
(Oam), cholesterol (Chl) (Merck), AsA (Merck), Glu (Sigma-Aldrich),
and LaA (Merck) were used as received. All other materials used were
of analytical reagent grade from commercial sources. The CDorg solution was characterized by PL spectroscopy (JASCO spectrofluorometer-FP
8300) to study its fluorescence behavior. The spectra were obtained
at the excitation wavelengths (λex) of 380, 400,
420, 440, 460, 480, and 500 nm. The surface morphology was investigated
using an SEM from Carl Zeiss (Sigma VP). For the SEM analysis, the
CDorg solution was drop-casted on a silicon wafer (∼1
cm × 1 cm) and dried in air, followed by Au/Pd alloy coating
in vacuum, and was used for imaging. The XPS elemental analysis was
performed using a commercial Omicron EA 125 spectrometer having a
seven-channel detection system. The particle size distribution analyses
were performed with a Malvern Zetasizer NanoZS 90. The FTIR spectroscopic
measurements of the samples were recorded in a Bruker FTIR spectrophotometer.
The samples were prepared in the form of potassium bromide (KBr) pellets
by drop-casting the CDorg solution onto prepared KBr pellets
of IR spectroscopic grade and then drying at 60 °C.

General Procedure
for the Synthesis of Deoxycholic Acid-Based
Hydrazones (5a–d) as a Precursor for Organogel
To
a hot solution of 3 (1 mmol) and 6 (1 mmol) in ethanol (20 mL), a
catalytic amount of glacial acetic acid was added, and the reaction
mixture was refluxed for 8 h. The completion of the reaction was monitored
by thin-layer chromatography. After the completion of the reaction,
the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, and the formed
precipitate was filtered under reduced pressure to yield the crude
product, which was recrystallized using An to give the pure product
(Figure 10). Among 5a–d, 5d was used for the preparation
of the organogel as a precursor of CDorg as it showed the
best gelation property with stability at room temperature (details
provided in Supporting Information (SI)).

Synthesis of Organogel
(Og)
The organogel
(8%) was prepared in DMSO using deoxycholic acid hydrazone-based compound
5d as the organogelator (Figure 11). Briefly, 0.08 g of the organogelator was dispersed
in 1 mL of DMSO, followed by heating at 100 °C for 20 min. The
dispersion was allowed to cool down to room temperature and was kept
in a refrigerator for 12 h resulting in the solidification of the
dispersion, which was then kept at room temperature. The hard solid
gradually melted down and resulted in the formation of a gel-like
structure after 5–6 h.

hydrazone (5d) used

Synthesis of Organic CD (CDorg) from Organogel (Og) in THF (OgT-CDorg)
Approximately,
0.1 g of Og was dispersed in 10 mL of THF. The solution
was then allowed to reflux at 100 °C with 400 rpm magnetic stirring
under N2 flow. After 1 h of reflux, the CDorg solution was cooled down to room temperature and stored as OgT-CDorg. Likewise, four other solvents, Tu, Hx,
An, and Ech, were also investigated for the synthesis of CDorg from Og.

Synthesis of Organic CD (CDorg) from Organogel (Og) in THF/Oleylamine (OgTOam-CDorg)
Next, we studied the potential
role of oleylamine (Oam) as a surface passivating agent
for the synthesis of CDorg. Initially, a 9:1 ratio solution
of THF/oleylamine (TOam) was prepared, into which 0.1 g
of Og was dispersed
and then refluxed following the same procedure as that followed in
OgT-CDorg. After a 1 h reflux, the solution
was stored as OgTOam-CDorg (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Synthesis of an Organic
CD (OgTOam-CDorg) from an Organogel
(Og) in a 9:1 THF/Oam (TOam) Solution
AIEE Assay of OgTOam-CDorg
The solutions of OgTOam-CDorg in
different mixtures (v/v) of THF/water were prepared by adding 50 μL
of OgTOam-CDorg into 1 mL solution
of the mixture with different fractions of water. For preparing the
THF/water mixture, a 9:1 ratio solution of THF/oleylamine (TOam) was used as the solvent, as OgTOam-CDorg was prepared in this solvent ratio. Then, a total
of 10 THF/water mixtures (v/v), viz., 90/10, 80/20, 70/30, 60/40,
50/50, 40/60, 30/70, 20/80, 10/90, and 0/100, were prepared containing
10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100% fractions of water, respectively.
The PL measurements of the resultant solutions were taken at the excitation
wavelength (λex) of 380 nm. The respective fluorescence
images of the solutions under a UV lamp of 365 nm were also obtained
simultaneously.

Investigation of OgTOam-CDorg as a Fluorescence Sensing Probe for Cholesterol
The potential
of CDorg as a fluorescence sensor for enzyme-free detection
of cholesterol was investigated. A 0.1 mM solution of cholesterol
(Chl) in THF was prepared. For the sensing analysis, to a 1 mL solution
of OgTOam-CDorg, 1000 μL of
Chl solution was added stepwise, with a 100 μL volume in each
step, followed by obtaining a PL spectrum subsequently. Similarly,
the sensitivity of OgTOam-CDorg toward
the detection of cholesterol was studied with concentrations of 0.5
mM, 1 μM, and 0.5 μM of Chl in THF.

Interference
Study
The interference of other analytes
is a major limitation of any sensing material. To investigate such
interference in our system, AsA, Glu, and LaA were considered as the
interfering analytes. A 1 mM solution of each of the analytes was
prepared and tested as per the procedure followed in the detection
of Chl.

Enzyme-Free Cholesterol Detection in the Human Blood Serum
The applicability of OgTOam-CDorg for detecting the level of cholesterol present in the human blood
serum in the absence of any enzyme was examined. Two human blood serum
samples with known levels of Chl were collected from Pratiksha Hospital,
Guwahati, Assam, with the consent of the hospital authority. The blood
serum was first dispersed in THF, followed by vigorous stirring for
5 min and addition into the OgTOam-CDorg solution whose PL spectrum was recorded. The level of Chl was then
calculated from the calibration curve obtained from the standard solution
of Chl in THF at different concentrations.
