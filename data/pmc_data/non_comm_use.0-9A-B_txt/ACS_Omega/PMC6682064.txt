The
neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a unique, specialized chemical
synapse that plays a crucial role in transmitting and amplifying information
from spinal motor neurons to skeletal muscles. NMJ complexity ensures
closely intertwined interactions between numerous synaptic vesicles,
signaling molecules, ion channels, motor neurons, glia, and muscle
fibers, making it difficult to dissect the underlying mechanisms and
factors affecting neurodegeneration and muscle loss. Muscle fiber
or motor neuron cell death followed by rapid axonal degeneration due
to injury or disease has a debilitating effect on movement and behavior,
which adversely affects the quality of life. It thus becomes imperative
to study the synapse and intercellular signaling processes that regulate
plasticity at the NMJ and elucidate mechanisms and pathways at the
cellular level. Studies using in vitro 2D cell cultures have allowed
us to gain a fundamental understanding of how the NMJ functions. However,
they do not provide information on the intricate signaling networks
that exist between NMJs and the biological environment. The advent
of 3D cell cultures and microfluidic lab-on-a-chip technologies has
opened whole new avenues to explore the NMJ. In this perspective,
we look at the challenges involved in building a functional NMJ and
the progress made in generating models for studying the NMJ, highlighting
the current and future applications of these models.

==== Body
Neuromuscular Junction
The neuromuscular junction (NMJ)
is a large cholinergic synapse
responsible for muscle functioning. Any structural changes or degeneration
of this vital junction could result in motor neuron cell death and
muscle atrophy. The NMJ comprises three integral components working
in tandem—a presynaptic motor neuron terminal, the intrasynaptic
basal lamina1 in the synaptic cleft, and
the postsynaptic muscle membrane.2 In response
to stimuli, activated multimeric neuronal voltage-gated channels open,
leading to a calcium influx into the cell. The calcium induces the
acetylcholine (ACh)-filled synaptic vesicles to fuse with the neuronal
cell membrane, releasing the neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft.
ACh binds to the highly dense nicotine acetylcholine receptors (nAChR)
on the post synaptic muscle leading to the depolarization of the membrane
through activation of the sodium channels. This depolarization further
activates voltage-gated L-type calcium channels and ryanodine receptors
in the muscle, triggering calcium release from the sarcolemma. The
released calcium binds to troponin C, inducing the motion of the motor
protein elements. Figure 1 shows a schematic of synaptic transmission at the NMJ.

Figure 1 The NMJ: influx
of calcium (Ca2+) into the motor neuron
leads to release of the neurotransmitter, ACh into the synaptic cleft.
ACh binds to the receptors on skeletal muscle membranes opening up
ion channels, leading to muscle depolarization and contraction.

Even though the preformed AChR
clusters on the post synaptic membrane
may have a role in determining where innervations of muscle fibers
occur,3 studies have shown that the extending
axons of motor neurons form synapses at a different location.4 There is species-dependent pre- and post-synaptic
differentiation with differences observed in NMJ formation between
rodents and zebrafish.5 Many parallel signaling
pathways are involved in generating a functional motor unit. Post
synaptic maturation and AChR clustering is also regulated by factors
such as neuregulin 1 and WNT ligands and receptors such as ERBB.6

The NMJ is further complicated by the different
types of motor
neurons and muscle fibers involved (Figure 2). The α, β, and γ lower
motor neurons are of varying sizes, and they innervate different muscle
fibers (slow- and fast-twitch muscle) to form slow, fast fatigable,
and fast fatigue-resistant motor units.7 The relatively smaller number of motor neurons also necessitates
one motor neuron innervating several muscle fibers. For instance,
the 400 motor neurons innervating the gastrocnemius muscle supplies
approximately 300 000 muscle fibers.8

Figure 2 The
complexity involved in a functional NMJ: the complexity of
the NMJ is highlighted here, indicating how species, muscle type,
synapse location, type of neurotransmitters, glial cells, and signaling
pathways all play a role in defining function and development.

The NMJ was initially explored
as a synapse to understand synaptic
plasticity, development, and function due to its size and easy access.
However, the rising prevalence of neurodegenerative and muscular disorders
also necessitated a model to study the pathophysiology underlying
diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and myasthenia
gravis, where the denervation at the NMJ results in the weakening
of limbs and increasing unsteadiness in gait.9 Understanding the pathogenesis of these disorders at the NMJ is
hence critical for early diagnosis and effective treatment. This pressing
imperative to investigate new treatment strategies underlines the
need for better models that can provide some much needed insights
into the mechanisms involved in NMJ disruption.

Advances in
healthcare have led to shifts in age demographics with
the percentage of the older population increasing each year. Age-associated
degeneration of the NMJ has thus increased the urgency for the development
of robust NMJ models to understand the mechanism involved in motor
neuron death and muscle loss apart from evaluating novel therapeutic
interventions for the same. Fabrication of NMJ has also been aimed
toward tissue engineering the stretch reflex arc and may have applications
in the field of robotics and prosthetics.10

Over the last few decades, the NMJ has been extensively studied
in animal models, primarily to understand synaptogenesis.5,9 However, while these studies have resulted in better clarity, models
such as the SOD1 mice for ALS have not translated well into effective
treatment for human ALS, calling into question their efficacy.11 Although animal models have been at the forefront
of research into the NMJ,9,12 it also presents several
impediments in the form of ethical issues involving animal welfare,
limited time points to study developmental regulation, and the influence
of other factors such as migrating cells, disease, organ failure,
and immune response13 in the test animal.
The failure to adequately translate animal research to clinical benefits14 gives impetus to explore other high throughput
in vitro techniques. It is further challenging to examine the NMJs
of humans during the early stages of the disease or over long periods
of time due to absence of reliable biomarkers and invasive biopsies.
Researchers have tried to overcome this hurdle by trying to recreate
the NMJ using in vitro models for a more high-throughput analysis
that includes understanding disease pathways, creating therapeutic
targets, drug discovery, and toxicology. The advent of stem cells15 and human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)
provide attractive opportunities to study the human NMJ using in vitro
models.16

The role of signaling factors
and signaling pathways, cell types,
receptors and mechanisms involved, changes that occur with age and
disease, maturation at both the pre- and post-synaptic terminals,
and the varied responses to drugs are still subject to debate.6 This is especially true with respect to the developmental
regulation at the NMJ and the structural changes that accompany aging
or disease. Early in vitro studies involved 2D motor neuron–skeletal
muscle dissociated cocultures and organotypic cultures to simplify
the system under study and to augment and complement the accompanying
animal research into the NMJ. The development of specialized lab-on-a-chip
(LOC) and microfluidics technology has created high-throughput in
vitro models enabling investigators to narrow down, isolate, and study
the NMJ at the cellular and molecular levels. More recently, the advent
of three dimensional (3D) bioprinting has led to the fabrication of
the NMJ in tissue-like environments, closely mimicking the NMJ development
and functionality found in vivo.

An important facet of NMJ in
vitro models and one of the reasons
for the paucity of work in this area is the complexity involved in
culturing two different cell types harvested from different environments
in vivo. Both cell types often require different culture conditions
(culture medium, growth, and differentiation factors) when cultured
separately, and this complexity renders it difficult to create these
NMJ in vitro models. The differing mechanical properties of muscle
and neuron, for example, would require the right culture substrate
which in turn should allow for neuronal process outgrowth and muscle
differentiation.17

The following
sections examine past and current techniques used
to study the NMJ, and trace the progress made toward building high-throughput
3D in vitro NMJ models for research into synaptogenesis, disease,
aging, and drug discovery. We discuss the novel results that research
in this area has yielded, highlight the advantages that microfluidic
tools add to in vitro models, and propose ways to further bolster
such systems, bringing it closer to in vivo conditions.

2D in Vitro
NMJ Models
The functional significance
of the NMJ became the focus of interest at the turn of the 20th century
when Harrison observed the contraction of a myotome still left attached
to a piece of medullary cord in a frog embryo tissue culture. Early
research involved removing sections of the embryonic spinal cord from
test animals with the muscle still attached to the developing ganglia.
Studies of the NMJ using in vitro methods commenced with an examination
of the nerve–muscle connections in the spinal cord–somite
regions of a chick and mouse embryo.18 These
studies gave important insights into the development and function
at post- and pre-synaptic structures including synaptic vesicles.
Organotypic cocultures are still used to explore the NMJ. Nerve–muscle
coculture models have pointed to the muscle as being a therapeutic
target for degenerative diseases such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).
In the case of patients suffering from ALS, experiments conducted
using the patient serum revealed no neurotoxicity in organotypic cocultures.19

Later research into 2D NMJ models involved
culturing dissociated motor neurons and muscle cells on surfaces coated
with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and covered with cell culture
medium. Figure 3 shows
a simple schematic of a 2D coculture of motor neurons and muscle cells
using this strategy.

Figure 3 2D cocultures of dissociated motor neuron and muscle cells.

a coverslip. The motor neurons are usually cultured on top of the
muscle cells, which are seeded on a coverslip coated with ECM proteins.
(b) 2D culture: side view of muscle cells and motor neurons seeded

Disease pathology has
also been studied using in vitro 2D NMJ models.
Cultures of dystrophic embryonic myotubes and neurons have been employed
to understand dystrophy. Human skeletal muscle from children with
Duchenne muscular dystrophy was found to form stable, mature, functional
motor end plates with fetal mouse spinal cord explants but displayed
lesions after 2–4 months in culture in contrast to normal muscle20

In vitro NMJ models provide the opportunity
to use stem cells,
genetically modified cells, and human cells, finding possible applications
in drug discovery, personalized medicine, and for exploring disease
pathology. Motor neurons derived from multipotent spinal cord precursor
cells have formed synaptic junctions with skeletal myocytes.21 Murine HB9::GFP transgenic embryonic stem cells,
differentiated into motor neurons, formed NMJs in a coculture with
myotubes.22 Motor neurons differentiated
from human spinal cord stem cells were first shown to form synapses
with embryonic rat skeletal myotubes under serum-free conditions15 in a preliminary study. A later study resulted
in the development of a unique in vitro human NMJ from human spinal
cord stem cells and human skeletal muscle stem cells in a defined
environment.23 Human mesenchymal cells
that were genetically engineered to express enhanced green fluorescent
protein and the motor neuron associated transcription factors Olig
and HB9 could be induced to become motor neuron-like cells that formed
functional motor units with differentiated C2C12 myotubes.24

Though a plethora of reports are available
on 2D models for NMJ,
they do not perfectly mimic the native tissue architecture. Moreover,
most of the studies were performed on static cultures that do not
reproduce the dynamic flow conditions encountered in biological systems.
Long-term maintenance of the 2D cultures also remains a challenge.
Improved models of the NMJ need to be developed to overcome these
issues. Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS)-based systems offer
a dynamic localized environment to probe the events occurring at the
NMJ.

MEMS & Microfluidic Tools: Compartmentalized In Vitro NMJ
Models
Tissue engineering applications that have been explored
till date for the study of the NMJ include regenerative strategies
for tackling disease conditions such as dystrophy and building prosthetic
devices. Recent research has focused on extending in vitro NMJ models
toward building the stretch reflex arc10 where the E18 rat skeletal muscle innervated by DRG neurons and
grown on surface-modified MEMS cantilever devices in a defined system
demonstrated functional interaction between muscle and sensory neurons.25 Contractile function was quantified using a
laser and photo-detector unit to sense cantilever deflection from
motor neuron innervated muscle twitching.

The advent of devices
incorporating microfluidics technology has allowed for a compartmentalized
study on the effects of different stimuli. With precise control over
the cell micro-environment including diffusion and fluid flow, microfluidics
presents a novel platform to study the NMJ. Motor neurons and muscle
in two different chambers connected by axons in the microchannels,
enabling spatiotemporal control over the cells,26 help in studying localized actions at the soma, along the
axon, and at the NMJ. Microtunnels or microgrooves were initially
used to study hippocampal neurons and were plated on microelectrode
arrays to study parameters such as the propagation speed and direction
of action potentials.27 Campenot first
demonstrated independent control of the proximal and distal fluid
environment of the cell soma and neurites to understand the effect
of nerve growth factor, leading to the establishment of Campenot chambers.28 Microfluidic devices allowed for the growth
of neurons in wells or chambers, with axonal growth along narrow tunnels
10 μm wide and 3 μm high to a second, isolated chamber,
allowing for a separation of cell body and axons.29 The dimensions of the microchannels limit the size of the
neurites entering it and restrict cell bodies from crossing over to
other chambers while allowing for communication between the two chambers
through their projections.

The fabrication of these microfluidic
devices is relatively easy,30 generally
made using poly(dimethylsiloxane)
(PDMS) and are now available commercially.31 Such devices have proved to be effective for the visualization and
manipulation of synapses32 and to study
retrograde33 and anterograde34 axonal transport. Central nervous system injury
was investigated using microfluidic platforms by exploring the role
of myelin-associated inhibitors in axonal regeneration and quantifying
the time taken for axonal growth in response to these soluble factors.35 Myogenic differentiation in response to chemical,36 electrical,37 and
mechanical stimuli38 has been studied using
microdevices. The ability to enforce geometric constraints on cells39 and provide chemical guidance cues40 allows for control on growth, differentiation,
movement, and alignment.

One of the first studies toward a functional
NMJ, incorporating
microcompartments and microconduits on microelectrode arrays, involved
rat cervical ganglion neurons and ventricular myocytes.41 Synaptic pathways between the two cell types
were confirmed by stimulating and recording evoked electrical responses
using the microelectrodes. One of the studies, looking specifically
at the synaptic innervation of skeletal muscle using microdevices,
was reported by Park et al. In this work, a microfluidic platform
with two microchambers (6.35 mm × 12.75 mm × 4.76 mm) connected
by 100 parallel microchannels (10 μm wide and 500 μm long)
was developed for a functional NMJ between mouse embryonic stem cell-derived
motor neurons and C2C12 myotubes.42 The
coculture was maintained in neuronal culture medium with supplementation
of growth factors for axonal growth. Seven days after the axons crossed
through the micro-tunnels to the second chamber, NMJs were identified
by staining for bungarotoxin, which binds to nAChR and helps visualize
axons anchored on myotubes. In order to mimic the complex in vivo
cellular interactions, embryonic rat spinal motor neurons were cocultured
with spinal glial cells from postnatal day 2 (P2) rat pups in the
poly-l-laminin-coated proximal chamber of a microfluidic
device.43 As axons started extending into
the distal chamber, the P2 rat hind limb skeletal muscle myocytes
were plated in the collagen-coated chamber and a serum-free medium
was used for both cell types. The plating of specific cell types in
the proximal and distal chambers in both these studies were timed
such that the neurites from motor neurons can reach mature differentiated
myotubes that can form NMJs.

The applications of microfluidics
in studying the NMJ were highlighted
by Zahavi et al.44 Using a compartmentalized
microfluidic device with microchannels that enable bidirectional communication
between motor neurons and muscle, the group was able to demonstrate
that trophic factors such as glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)
act differently at the axon and on the soma, having spatially distinct
effects. Motor neurons from spinal cord explants of the transgenic
HB9::GFP mice and the FM-4-64 (N-(3-triethylammoniumpropyl)-4-(6-(4-(diethylamino)phenyl)hexatrienyl)pyridinium
dibromide) dyes were used to enable visualization of vesicular release
at the sites of NMJ, whereas myoblasts infected with lentiviral vectors,
GDNF–mCherry (GDNF tagged with red fluorescent protein mCherry)
were used to visualize retrograde GDNF transport from muscle to neuron
for the first time. This work underlines the significance of in vitro
microfluidic models in investigating the molecular events at the NMJ.

3D in Vitro NMJ Models
3D cell culture systems have
become more relevant over the last decade as they closely mimic in
vivo conditions as opposed to routine 2D cultures Figure 4.

Figure 4 3D culture: side view
of muscle cells and motor neurons cocultured
in matrigel. The muscle cells are usually allowed to differentiate
into muscle fibers in the matrigel before the motor neurons are added
on top of them and differentiated to form neuron-muscle contacts.

Typically, 3D cocultures to study
the NMJ involve culturing muscle
cells in hydrogels like Matrigel or ECM matrices and then differentiating
motor neurons over them. 3D cell cultures tend to be more functionally
relevant with respect to contractile muscle. Extensive work has been
done to tissue engineer skeletal muscle constructs using 3D cultures.45 Collagen I is a major component of native ECM
and has adequate mechanical properties needed for contraction and
force generation. Collagen gel constructs have been used to study
early skeletal muscle development and muscle aging.46 Collagen, however, has less stability and degrades faster,
proving to be ineffective for long-term cultures.47 Matrigel, a commercially available decellularized ECM,
allowed for better differentiation of muscle progenitor cells compared
to collagen.48 Other attractive alternatives
to collagen are fibrinogen, thrombin, or fibrin. Silk fibroin has
even better mechanical strength and stability when compared to collagen
and may be another promising material for 3D cultures to mimic the
NMJ.49 Tissue-engineered muscle has been
generated from myotubes using fibrin gels, where cell-mediated contraction
evoked response to electrical stimuli.50

A more recent study has fabricated three-dimensional human
skeletal
muscle tissue using myoblasts incorporated into a hydrogel mixture
that contains thrombin and fibrinogen and seeded onto a custom-made
device used to provide the uniaxial stress stimulation.51 The myoblasts are separately differentiated
as human embryonic stem cells into post-mitotic motor neurons, which
are maintained in Matrigel and cultured in a medium containing specific
differentiation factors such as insulin. Once the differentiated motor
neurons formed clusters, they were transferred to the hydrogel muscle
suspensions and the culture medium was accordingly changed and supplemented
with growth factors. This study added to the mounting evidence that
a 3D environment aids in the maturation and alignment of mature fibers,
in the increased presence and clustering of ACh receptors, the upregulation
of muscle markers such as myosin heavy chain, and spontaneous electrical
activity accompanied by twitching. Another similar study explored
a long term (35 days) human skeletal muscle coculture along with iPSC-derived
motor neurons in 3D collagen constructs, where the motor neurons maintained
their cholinergic phenotype for around 21 days.52

3D neuronal cultures should enable the growth, differentiation,
and proliferation of neuronal cells, allow for and guide neurite outgrowth,
and induce the formation of functional synapses. The culture of both
skeletal muscle in 3D environments and motor neuron cells in proximity
to skeletal muscles cells have demonstrated improved maturation, contraction
outputs, and upregulation of muscle and neuronal markers.53 Muscle-derived cells differentiate, fuse, and
align in 3D collagen constructs as per the physiological architecture
found in vivo and axonal growth cones from motor neurons were able
to move through the collagen toward the myotubes and form synaptic
structures.53 In a similar study, primary
muscle-derived cells and mixed ventral horn cells were cultured on
3D fibrin constructs to create a tissue-engineered NMJ. Muscle function
of the NMJ construct was assessed using electrical stimulation, and
the upregulation of muscle and neuronal markers such as desmin, MAP-2,
antisynaptic vesicle protein-2 (SV-2), and myosin heavy chain were
assessed using confocal microscopy and reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR).54 In all these
studies, the muscle-derived cells are allowed to grow, differentiate,
and become confluent before the spinal motor neurons are plated with
them to make the NMJ. Frega et al. designed a unique strategy to form
3D neuronal cultures from hippocampal neurons grown on layers of laminin
and poly-l-lysine-coated 40 μm glass beads. Placing
these 3D layers over a neuronal monolayer on top of microelectrode
arrays created network connectivity and enabled measurement of both
spontaneous and evoked field potentials. Collagen gel cultures have
been used to study the effect of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin
1β and tumor necrosis factor on neurite outgrowth.55 Kaplan’s group has developed a “functional
brain-like cortical tissue” using 3D neuronal cultures in silk
fibroin-based materials in a compartmentalized manner.56 The silk fibroin provided both the required
electrical connectivity and mechanical stability to mimic the spongy
brain tissue.

Work on developing 3D models using motor neuron
and muscle cells
has been increasing in recent years. As demonstrated by studies with
2D cultures, dimensional restraints disallow proper contractile functioning
of muscle monolayers in response to stimulation from innervating motor
neurons.57 The difficulty in culturing
motor neurons and muscle in compatible 3D constructs/gels with the
appropriate mechanical, electrical, and chemical cues for cell differentiation,
proliferation, contraction, and neurite outgrowth has made it harder
to construct 3D NMJs.

In a seminal report, Morimoto et al.,
have presented some of the
first results in 3D in vitro NMJ models.58 Using PDMS stamps, they patterned C2C12 mouse muscle myoblast-loaded
Matrigel onto PDMS substrates. The patterned muscle cells were cultured
on the PDMS substrates to form free-standing muscle fibers anchored
to fibronectin-coated glass plates fixed at both ends of the substrate.
Mouse neural stem cells were then plated on these free-standing fibers
after reducing the volume of culture medium to enable attachment of
the “neurospheres” to the fibers. After ensuring attachment,
the neural stem cells were then differentiated into neurons, and they
formed functional NMJs that can be stimulated to trigger muscle contractions
after 14 days in culture. Although 3D cultures provide a substrate
or scaffold that mimic physiological environments, the organization
and alignment of muscle fibers and motor neurons are equally important
for the guidance of axons and communication between pre- and post-synaptic
structures. Micropatterned NMJs in a dish on mechanically patterned
ECM strip have been formed, demonstrating increased differentiation
and fusion of the myotubes compared to 3D cultures and larger ACh
receptors.59 An increased expression of
NMJ receptors such as MuSK and Lrp4 and an increased contraction of
the myotube fibers when stimulated by ACh confirm the presence of
a fully functional NMJ.

More research is required in this area
to generate viable, long-term
3D in vitro models for the NMJ. As detailed earlier, both skeletal
muscle and neuronal cells do well in collagen, matrigel, and silk
fibroin gels. Collagen type I gels would provide the desired porosity
for axonal growth60 and the necessary elasticity
for contractility. Fibrin–collagen61 or hyaluronic acid–collagen62 constructs
could be used for added mechanical stability.

Microfluidics and 3D In
Vitro NMJ Models
The ability
to combine both 3D cultures and microfluidic devices to study the
NMJ is an attractive prospect. Microfluidics would enable spatial
and temporal control over the microenvironment while allowing for
a precise, specific, and localized interrogation of the system. The
3D environment would provide for better cell survival, growth, differentiation,
and functionality making long-term studies using in vitro cultures
possible. Putting together these models would provide the best of
both worlds while overcoming some of the disadvantages inherent in
each technique. Motor neurons and muscle cells can be compartmentalized
while providing spatial guidance cues and signaling gradients using
perfusion or 3D hydrogels63 for better
integration and formation of synapses.64 Shimizu et al., have shown a promising start in this area by engineering
functional 3D contractile C2C12 skeletal muscle myofibers in microchannels,65 while Yang et al. have confirmed the role of
in vivo paracrine signals in the differentiation of human neuronal
stem cells cultured in a 3D ECM hydrogel-filled microfluidic device.66 Yang’s work is noteworthy because it
involves the interaction between two cell types in two different chambers
and the cell–cell interaction here induces stem cell differentiation
via paracrine signaling.

Other work in this area has included
the differentiation of neuroepithelial stem cells into functional
dopaminergic neurons in a 3D microfluidic device67 and the development of a photo-cross linked polymer gelatin
methacrylate, which could be incorporated into a microfluidic device
to culture neural stem cells.68 Work has
been done on an in vitro platform by Uzel et al.,69 where 3D hydrogel cultures of mouse embryonic stem cell-derived
motor neurons and skeletal muscle were compartmentalized using PDMS
chambers separated by flexible pillars that serve to direct neurite
outgrowth as well as deflect upon muscle contraction. Figure 5 schematically depicts this
idea behind combining microfluidics and 3D cultures to study the NMJ.

Figure 5 Combining
3D hydrogel cultures with microfluidic PDMS chambers
and anchoring pillars to separate both cell types as well as isolate
and study the NMJ.

The arrival of iPSCs
has opened new avenues of investigation in
different fields including studies on NMJ.16 Recent reports have indicated that iPSCs from patients with neurodegenerative
diseases such as ALS70 and SMA71 can be differentiated into motor neurons. Incorporating
such cells into standardized 3D microfluidic devices would help identify
therapeutic targets and have applications in drug discovery and personalized
medicine.

3D Bioprinting
The advent of 3D bioprinting has made
it easier to explore tissue engineering in vitro using disassociated
cell cultures, cocultures, and 3D hydrogels/ECM proteins, allowing
for the use of flexible designs that more accurately capture in vivo
conditions. Recent studies have looked at using 3D bioprinting to
make in vitro models of the NMJ. C2C12 myoblasts differentiated into
multinucleated myotubes and mouse embryonic stem cells differentiated
into motor neurons were first cultured separately in ECM proteins
to create a muscle ring tissue and embryoid bodies (EB), respectively.72 The engineered muscle tissue, ECM proteins,
and EB were all then combined with different hydrogels, which allows
for the formation of multi-ringed tissue that are integrated with
each other. Cell–gel combinations included C2C12 cells in thrombin,
fibrinogen, and matrigel solutions cultured in differentiation factors
and tissue molds to form a ring-like structure. Additional cells in
gels, including EB containing motor neurons, were then added to the
hydrogel ring molds to form the tissue rings. Analysis performed using
immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and neurite growth measurements
showed a greater quantity of differentiated motor neurons—pointing
to the effect of the 3D hydrogel environment. The presence of supporting
glial cells among the EB is also thought to contribute to the better
survival, growth, differentiation, and proliferation of motor neurons
as well as the formation and maintenance of the NMJ. The motor neurons,
C2C12 muscle myotubes and clusters of postsynaptic functional AChR
units were identified by fluorescence imaging. Spontaneous twitching
was also observed within individual layers and between the layers
of these motor neuron constructs. These tissue construct rings were
then placed on bioprinted 3D hydrogel “skeletons” that
provide the structural integrity, stability, and connectivity of the
muscle–tendon–ligament–bone structures found
in the body. EBs showed extended neurite outgrowth into the “tissue”
and chemical stimulation leads to contraction of the aligned muscle
fiber tissue.72

More recently, a
study along similar lines examined developing 3D bioprinted silk fibroin
cantilevers as support systems for culturing and aligning human myotubes,
and the addition of motor neuron-like cells from human induced stem
cells into this system allows for the integration of these cells with
muscle and provides a novel in vitro platform comprising NMJ units.73 Such novel 3D bioprinted functional NMJ tissue
structures can be used to quantify muscle activity, the effect of
chemical and electrical stimulants, and the changes in growth and
development of the NMJ units themselves over time and in response
to external stimuli.

Current Outlook and Future Perspectives
A combination
of novel compartmentalized microfluidic chambers and varied cell culture
models are currently being used to understand neuromuscular functioning
and signaling pathways, disease pathologies, and to test new therapeutic
drugs. Although it is understood that glia play a central role in
supporting neuronal cells, the complexity of culturing three different
cell types in vitro has limited the introduction of these supporting
cells into the NMJ models that comprise motor neurons and skeletal
muscle cells. Schwann cells, in particular, play an important role
in the development and functioning of the motor neuron. A time-dependent
addition of motor neurons (day 5) and Schwann cells (day 9) to skeletal
muscle cells in a compartmentalized microfluidic platform showed a
significant increase in the viability, number, and length of individual
myotubes.74

The development of stable,
functional NMJ models has recently led to different groups trying
to understand and study disease pathology at the molecular level.
Increasingly optogenetics is being explored to identify NMJs and create
motor neurons activated by light as opposed to electrical stimulation.
Using human iPSC (hiPSC) also allows for human and patient donor-specific
NMJ models. The combination of compartmentalized microfluidic chambers,
the optogenetic channel-rhodopsin-2 protein-expressing photosensitive
motor neurons, and the non-optogenetic skeletal muscle from a single
donor was used to study NMJ functionality and connectivity over time
as well as the effect of neurotoxin-induced damage. This novel model
provided the added advantage of being able to study disease pathology
wherein the NMJ acted as a biosensor, being able to detect and change
in response to myasthenia gravis autoantibodies in patient serum.75 In this study, motor neurons were stimulated
optically and force/contraction measurements were performed using
specially developed software. Motor units, motor neurons, skeletal
muscle cell viability and functionality were characterized using immunohistochemistry
and flow cytometry. The microfluidic platform used for compartmentalization
is an updated version of earlier models consisting of compartments
separated by channels for axonal growth and pillars for muscle bundle
attachment.

ALS is another fatal neurodegenerative disease that
involves motor
neuron degeneration and muscle atrophy. NMJ dysfunction and damage
precedes motor neuron cell death in ALS and groups are now attempting
to build patient-specific microfluidic-based chips of the NMJ. Using
optogenetic hiPSC-induced motor neurons from patients with sporadic
ALS, Kamm et al. were able to assess and quantify neurite outgrowth,
muscle contraction, and cell viability and compare it to non-ALS motor
units. Pillars used to tether and separate skeletal muscle were used
to quantify muscle contraction when motor neurons were activated by
light. The efficacy of drugs and inhibitors used to treat ALS was
also studied in this model.76

There
are now many well-characterized in vitro LOC models of the
NMJ that could in the future be a part of the body of “body-on-a-chip”
systems. Current models include 3D cultures incorporating compartmentalized
motor neurons and skeletal muscle forming functional NMJs with supporting
cells such as Schwann cells aiding in the formation of robust motor
units. The advent of hiPSCs making these models patient-specific allows
us to finally explore the neurodegenerative diseases of the peripheral
nervous system at the molecular level and to aid in drug development
and study drug side effects. Such “NMJ chips” could
be developed into theranostic devices that can be used to monitor
and assess NMJ degeneration over time and develop effective treatment
strategies.

Although in vitro models and cell cultures cannot
precisely mimic
in vivo conditions for applications such as drug discovery, the advent
of microfluidic designs and lab/organ/body-on-a-chip devices allows
for creating environments that come close to physiological conditions.
Such in vitro microfluidic models of the NMJ or other tissue would
enable the cells to get nutrients and oxygen via fluid circulation
as well as be subjected to varied mechanical and chemical stimulation
needed for cell differentiation, growth, viability, and proliferation.
Such a system would also allow for drug perfusion and delivery to
target tissue sites and ways to monitor and assess tissue response.
An added advantage of such models is that the use of hiPSCs offers
an opportunity to test and study drug effects on human tissue as opposed
to animal models. A “bioreactor” model of the NMJ, using
a coculture of electrically stimulated skeletal myocytes and motor
neurons differentiated from transgenic mouse cell line-derived embryonic
stem cells was used to study the efficacy of drugs that affect key
signaling pathways during NMJ activation to develop a platform for
pharmaceutical testing.77 Dose–response
curves from these experiments reveal a concentration-dependent response
in this model to drugs that block the synthesis of ACh and act as
inhibitors of vesicular ACh transporters and neurotransmission. The
model was sensitive to low concentrations of the applied drugs, and
the inhibitory concentrations obtained were comparable to other in
vitro models. There are however no comparisons done with the half
maximal inhibitory concentrations and lethal doses in in vivo models.
The inability to replicate precise in vivo physiological conditions
and the differences that exist between in vivo and in vitro environments,
cell morphology, supporting cells, blood vessels, and other factors
are potential pitfalls and limitations to using these models for pharmacokinetics
and drug discovery.

Ultimately the “NMJ—on—a—chip”
could introduce a new paradigm in understanding the NMJ and in drug
testing, leading to a reduction in animal testing. More high quality
data is however necessary with in vitro results being comparable to
in vivo results. In vitro NMJ models, that closely mimic in vivo conditions,
could ultimately replace animal studies and provide an inexpensive,
high-throughput tool for treating neurodegenerative diseases, engineer
prosthetic devices, and understand aging at the NMJ. The integration
of 3D culture with microfluidic compartments for coculture of different
cell types may lead to an ideal NMJ mimic in the near future. The
increasing awareness and rising global incidence of neurodegenerative
disorders have provided the correct quantum of impetus to research
on developing realistic NMJ models in vitro, and it is but a matter
of time when these systems will be routinely employed for drug discovery
and basic science studies.
