For monitoring the
regenerated bioactivity of a masked bioactive
compound, resveratrol (a luciferase inhibitor) was selected to target
such a compound. Caged resveratrol, masked by thiochromone-type photolabile-protecting
groups was synthesized in the study. Each caged resveratrol showed
lower bioactivity when compared to that shown by the original molecule.
After photoirradiation, the original bioactivity was found to be regenerated.
Furthermore, the fluorescent compound derived from the thiochromone-type
photolabile-protecting groups was generated simultaneously. A linear
correlation was observed between the regenerated bioactivity and generated
fluorescence intensity. Thus, we quantitatively monitored the recovered
bioactivity successfully by measuring the fluorescence.

Introduction
Regulation
of a compound’s bioactivity in vivo can be important
in determining its pharmacological mechanism and for development of
the drug-delivery systems (DDS). Prodrugs have been previously studied
for development of the DDS. Prodrugs, which are drug compounds masked
by functional groups, such as ester- or phosphate ester-type groups,
lose their original bioactive ability temporarily due to these groups.1,2 Conversely, the bioconversion of the prodrugs via enzymatic hydrolysis
and decarboxylation at the target organs can release each original
drug compound. Thus, prodrugs can spatiotemporally control their own
bioactivity.

Recently, light has been utilized for the recovery
of drug compounds
on the basis of the presence of photolabile-protecting groups (PLPGs)
instead of enzymatic deprotection. PLPGs can protect various functional
groups and are released from protected compounds by photoirradiation.3,4 The bioactive compounds masked by PLPGs are known as “caged
compounds”,5,6 which are a relatively new form
of prodrugs.7,8 The photodeprotection of these
compounds can proceed under mild conditions at specific position.
Thus, caged compounds have become suitable tools for improving physicochemical
or pharmacokinetic properties. Various PLPGs, such as o-nitrobenzyl,9 coumarin-4-ylmethyl,10o-alkylphenacyl,11 and 8-azacoumarin-4-ylmethyl12 groups, have been previously developed for caged compounds.
Regeneration of the original bioactive compounds from caged compounds
was assessed by examining the generated target bioactivity or via
structural analysis of the compounds. However, real-time assessment
of the photodeprotection process has not yet been elucidated.

Our laboratory has reported novel thiochromone-type PLPGs.13−16 These PLPGs show a unique property, which is the generation of highly
fluorescent compound during photoirradiation (Scheme 1). This property enables the application
of quantitative real-time monitoring of the photodeprotection process
by just measuring fluorescence (FL) using FL microscopes. Recently,
the following thiochromone-type PLPGs have been applied to the caged
compounds: caged d-luciferin17 and caged nucleic acid.18 In the case
of caged d-luciferin, regenerative d-luciferin was
confirmed via chemiluminescence (CL) measurement of oxyluciferin,
derived from the following luciferin–luciferase enzyme reaction.

Scheme 1 Photodeprotection and Photodeprotection Using Thiochromone-Type PLPG
However, this study did not
utilize the fluorescent compound derived
from thiochromone-type PLPGs for the assessment of the photodeprotection
process because the generated luciferin also possesses a strong fluorescent
property. In the case of the caged nucleic acid, it was expected that
the photodeprotection process could be measured using the fluorescent
compound derived from the PLPG, as the nucleic acids possess no fluorescent
property. However, in the photodeprotection process of caged nucleic
acids, several fluorescent compounds, such as reaction intermediates,
were generated. Thus, the photodeprotection process was not monitored
quantitatively using FL measurement. For quantitative monitoring of
the generated bioactivity, both the use of a substrate with no fluorescent
property and the generation of only one fluorescent compound after
photodeprotection are required. In this work, we aim to monitor directly
the recovery of bioactivity by FL of the fluorescent compound derived
from the thiochromone-type PLPG.

Results and Discussion
To achieve our goal, we selected resveratrol (3,5,4′-trihydroxy-stilbene)
as the new target molecule. Resveratrol does not possess a fluorescent
property, and the hydroxyl group of resveratrol can be protected using
the carbonate linkage by the thiochromone-type PLPG. In the case of
photoirradiation at this linkage, both deprotected compound and fluorescent
compound were formed, accompanied by the release of CO2, as reported previously.13 Furthermore,
the luciferin–luciferase reaction generates the chemiluminescent
product oxyluciferin, and resveratrol is known to be an antioxidant
or an inhibitor of luciferase. Thus, when resveratrol is present in
the luciferin–luciferase reaction, it has been reported to
insert preferentially into the active site of luciferase.19 Consequently, the luciferin–luciferase
reaction is inhibited and the generation of oxyluciferin diminishes.
However, the size of the caged resveratrol masked by the PLPG is quite
large because of the bulkiness of the protecting groups (Scheme 2a). The caged resveratrol,
therefore, cannot insert into the active site of luciferase because
of steric hindrance. As a result, CL of oxyluciferin must be observed
as usual. After photoirradiation of the caged resveratrol, the resveratrol
is released from the caged resveratrol, and it is expected that this
released resveratrol inhibits the generation of oxyluciferin (Scheme 2b). Furthermore,
the highly fluorescent compound is generated simultaneously.13 Thus, we expect that the recovery of bioactivity
can be quantitatively monitored via FL measurements.

Scheme 2 Control
of Inhibitory Ability Using Caged Resveratrol (a) without
and (b) with Photoirradiation
Synthesis and Evaluation of the Inhibitory Ability of Each Caged
Resveratrol
As shown in Scheme 3, resveratrol (1) has three
hydroxyl groups. Thiochromone-type PLPG (chloroformate thiochromone S,S-dioxide) may be connected to each hydroxyl
group of 1 (one unit: 2, 3;
two units: 4; three units: 5). III-Caged
resveratrol (5) protecting all hydroxyl groups was synthesized
at a moderate yield (33%). The number of introduced thiochromone-type
PLPGs for I- or II-caged resveratrols was controlled by the equivalent
of chloroformate thiochromone S,S-dioxide. I-Caged resveratrols as orange and yellow solids (2 and 3; protected at the meta-position (17%)
and at the para-position (19%), respectively) were obtained as a mixture.
The recrystallization of the former solid gave the orange crystal,
which was subjected to X-ray crystal structure analysis. This analysis
revealed that the orange crystal is a meta-position-masked 2 (Figure 1). Although
recrystallization of the yellow solid was not accomplished, it should
be a para-position-masked resveratrol 3, isolated from
the mixture of I-caged resveratrols via column chromatography. The
synthesis of II-caged resveratrols was also attempted, as in the case
of I-caged resveratrols; however, the obtained mixture could not be
separated via column chromatography. Thus, we attempted to synthesize
the II-caged resveratrol using an alternative method; the m,p-II-caged resveratrol (4) was synthesized from 3 as a substrate. Consequently,
a moderate amount of the desired compound, 4, was obtained
(27%).

Figure 1 Structure of meta-I-caged resveratrol (2) by X-ray crystal structure analysis.

Scheme 3 Synthesis and Structure of Each Caged Resveratrol
Then, we examined the luciferase
inhibitory ability of the synthesized
caged resveratrols (2–5) and the original resveratrol
molecule (1), respectively (see Experimental
Section). As mentioned before, the chemiluminescent oxyluciferin
is generated from the luciferin–luciferase reaction. If resveratrol
or caged resveratrols behaved as a luciferase inhibitor, the CL of
oxyluciferin would be diminished. Thus, we measured the relative luminescence
units (RLUs) of oxyluciferin in the sample containing each (caged)
resveratrol (Figure 2). The blank represents the sample containing luciferin and luciferase
only. In the experimental sample, oxyluciferin is generated from the
normal luciferin–luciferase reaction without inhibition. The
RLU obtained in this sample was therefore set as a standard value.
The sample of resveratrol 1 presented a very low RLU
value. This is because 1 shows the natural characteristic
as an inhibitor to luciferase. The sample of compound 5, which is most bulky among the synthesized caged resveratrols, exhibited
a high RLU value. The bulkiness of PLPGs successfully caused the resveratrol
to lose its property of a luciferase inhibitor, as we anticipated.
The relatively bulky caged compound 4 also presented
a high RLU value. Both of the thiochromone-type PLPGs introduced aromatic
rings to resveratrol (1), causing it to sufficiently
lose function as an inhibitor. Thus, the protection of both one meta-position
and one para-position is surely important for losing the inhibitory
ability. However, the
size of the thiochromone-type PLPG would not be sufficient for losing
that ability completely.

Figure 2 RLU of oxyluciferin containing each compound.

The RLU values of both the I-caged
compound (2 and 3) samples were lower than
those of the II- or III-caged resveratrol
(4 and 5) samples, although those values
were slightly higher (about 1.3 times) than those of the resveratrol
(1) sample. The presence of one thiochromone-type PLPG
at either the meta- or para-position rarely affects the function of
resveratrol. From these results, we selected 4 and 5 as the model caged compounds.

Photodeprotection of Caged
Resveratrol and Evaluation of Inhibitory
Ability
Before the examination of photodeprotection, known
as the uncaging process, UV–vis spectra of resveratrol (1) and caged resveratrols (2–5) were recorded to select the appropriate light source for photodeprotection
(Figure 3).

Figure 3 UV–vis
spectra of each compound in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).

Although the end of the absorbance band of resveratrol
(1) was at approximately 370 nm, 4 and 5 showed absorbance bands at more than 400 nm. From a biochemical
point of view, the light of a longer wavelength has been preferred
for the uncaging process to suppress damage to cell cultures. Furthermore,
photoirradiation at wavelengths less than 390 nm on 1 resulted partially in cis–trans isomerization of the stilbene
skeleton.20 Hence, we employed a Xe lamp
for the irradiation at 420 nm. Uncaging reactions were performed on
DMSO (see Experimental Section). If the expected
uncaging reaction proceeded, both resveratrol and the fluorescent
compound would be generated. To confirm this hypothesis, the FL spectra
of the sample solution, after photoirradiation, were first measured
at each photoirradiation period. Then, we measured the CL of oxyluciferin
in the same sample (see the Experimental Section).

An obvious FL intensity increment accompanied with the photoirradiation
time was observed (Figure 4). From the results of the mass spectrometry (MS) analysis
of one photodeprotection sample and 1H NMR analysis of
the total of some experimental solutions, it was verified that the
fluorescent compound emitted this FL. This means that the expected
uncaging reaction certainly occurs. The RLU value of oxyluciferin
in the sample decreased after photoirradiation, as the photoirradiation
time increased; however, the degree of decrement was very poor (Figure 5). Even after 60
min of photoirradiation, the RLU value was considerably higher than
that of the original resveratrol, 1. After 60 min of
photoirradiation, the generation of all I-caged (2 or 3), II-caged (4 or p,p-substituent compound), and III-caged compounds (5) was confirmed from the electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
(ESI-MS) spectra of the sample (see Supporting Information).

Figure 4 FL spectra of the photodeprotection process (excited at
360 nm,
5 μM of 5 in DMSO at 0 min).

Figure 5 RLU of oxyluciferin in each photodeprotection process of 5.

In the case of 5,
all three hydroxyl groups must be
removed for the recovery of the original resveratrol, 1; however, the generated fluorescent compound also absorbed light
at a wavelength of 420 nm. Consequently, the uncaging of 5 was inhibited by the fluorescent compound.

As shown in Figure 2, three groups in 5 and two groups in 4 possess a similar inhibitory
ability to that of luciferase. Thus,
photoirradiation of 4 was performed to enhance the uncaging
efficiency because the removal of the thiochromone-type PLPG in 4 proceeds more easily compared to that in 5.
The smooth increment of the FL intensity of 4 as well
as photoirradiation time was observed (Figure 6). A FL intensity similar to that in the
case of 5 was observed, although there was a lower number
of thiochromone-type PLPG (Figure 6 vs Figure 4). The RLU value after 60 min of photoirradiation was similar
to the value for resveratrol. This is because the generated I-caged
resveratrols (2 and 3) from 4 remain in the reaction mixture; however, the RLU value clearly decreased
with progress of photodeprotection when compared to that for 5 (Figure 7 vs Figure 5).

Figure 6 FL spectra
of the photodeprotection process (excited at 360 nm,
5 μM of 4 in DMSO at 0 min).

Figure 7 RLU of oxyluciferin in each photodeprotection process of 4.

These results not only show the
efficient photodeprotection reaction
of 4 but also that the monitoring of photodeprotection
by measuring FL achieved what was expected. To discuss these results
more quantitatively, we examined the correlation between the increasing
rate of the FL intensity of the fluorescent compound and the diminishing
rate of the CL intensity.

The correlation between the CL intensity
of oxyluciferin and FL
intensity of the fluorescent compound is shown in Figure 8. Intrinsically, the uncaging
of compound 4 proceeds stepwise, as shown in Scheme 4. Meanwhile, as shown
in Figure 2, I-caged
resveratrols 2 and 3 possess an inhibitory
ability similar to the original resveratrol 1. If both
uncaged compounds (one-caged resveratrol, 2 or 3 and original resveratrol 1) coexisted in the
sample solution, the inflection point (a lower diminishing rate of
CL against the increasing rate of FL) would be observed in this correlation.
Actually, a good linear correlation was observed over this photoirradiation
period (coefficient of determination (R2): 0.99). This result clearly showed that the first step of the process
in Scheme 4 proceeded
during this period, and only one-caged resveratrol (irrespective of
the substitution position) was contained in sample solution.

Figure 8 Plot of the
increasing rate of FL vs the diminishing rate of CL.

Scheme 4 Photodeprotection of m,p-II-Caged
Resveratrol
Consequently, although
regeneration of the original resveratrol
from compound 4 was not observed, it was demonstrated
that the regenerated bioactivity from caged compounds, masked by thiochromone-type
PLPGs, was assessed quantitatively by measuring FL, without the other
analyses, such as NMR, HPLC, or GC, on the basis of our two strategies
(I: the released bioactive compound possesses no fluorescent property,
II: one kind of fluorescent compound is afforded after the photoirradiation).

In this study, monitoring of the uncaging process via FL measurement
was accomplished in the DMSO solution. However, to apply caged compounds
to the in vivo experiment, the uncaging reaction must be conducted
under aqueous conditions. Thus, uncaging of the caged resveratrols
(4 and 5) was performed under aqueous conditions
(DMSO/H2O 50:50). Unfortunately, very low efficiencies
of uncaging both compounds were observed under these conditions. This
poor result may have been caused by the low water solubility of thiochromone-type
PLPGs. Therefore, we will improve the photodeprotection efficiency
of new caged compounds under aqueous conditions to modify the structure
of the thiochromone-type PLPGs.

Conclusions
To
monitor the uncaging process via FL measurements, the novel
caged resveratrols, 2–5, which were
masked by thiochromone-type PLPGs, were synthesized. The caged resveratrol
with thiochromone-type PLPGs (two units or three units) succeeded
in lowering the luciferase inhibitory ability of the original resveratrol 1. After photoirradiation of the caged resveratrol in DMSO,
the CL intensity of oxyluciferin, derived from the luciferin–luciferase
reaction, diminished. Therefore, the original inhibitory ability of
resveratrol was regenerated. Additionally, the FL intensity of the
highly fluorescent compound, which was transformed from the thiochromone-type
PLPG during photoirradiation, increased. Furthermore, a good linear
correlation was observed between the increasing rate of FL intensity
and diminishing rate of CL intensity. According to this linear correlation,
we succeeded in quantitatively monitoring the uncaging of caged resveratrol
only by measuring FL. Development of hydrophilic thiochromone-type
PLPGs is in progress.

Experimental Section
General Procedures
Most air or moisture-sensitive reactions
were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere using the available anhydrous
solvents. All reagents and solvents that were commercially purchased
were used without further purification. An ATP determination kit was
purchased from Life Technologies (Invitrogen). 1H NMR spectra
were measured on a JEOL JNM-ECP 500 spectrometer (500 MHz). 1H NMR spectra were reported as chemical shifts in parts per million
(ppm) (δ), integration, multiplicity (s = singlet, d = doublet,
t = triplet, and m = multiplet). Chemical shifts were reported in
ppm using the peak of chloroform-d (δ = 7.26
ppm) as an internal standard. 13C NMR spectra were measured
on a JNM-ECP 500 spectrometer (126 MHz). Chemical shifts were reported
in ppm using the peak of chloroform-d (δ =
77.16 ppm) as an internal standard or the peak of acetone-d (δ = 29.84 and 206.26 ppm). IR spectra were measured
on a JASCO FTIR-420 spectrometer. MS and high-resolution mass spectrometry
(HRMS) were recorded on a JEOL JMS-T100LC instrument. UV/vis spectra
were recorded in a quartz cell (10 mm thickness) on a JASCO V-630
spectrometer. FL spectra were recorded in a quartz cell (10 mm thickness)
on a JASCO FP-6500 spectrometer. The light source was the xenon lamp
(MAX 303 (irradiated at 420 nm through a bandpass filter), 300 W;
Asahi Spectra). CL was measured on a SPECTRARluor Plus luminometer.

Photodeprotection
Procedure and Luciferase-Inhibitive Assay
Photodeprotection of Each
Caged Resveratrol (4 and 5) and FL Measurements
The photodeprotection of caged
resveratrols was examined as follows. First, 4 or 5 were dissolved in DMSO to afford each 5 μM solution.
Next, each 5 μM solution was irradiated by a xenon lamp (MAX
303; 420 nm, 300 W) in a cuvette cell (1 cm). At each photoirradiation
time, the FL intensity was measured using FL spectroscopy (JASCO FP-6500
spectrometer). After the photoirradiation, each photoirradiated solution
was examined by the enzyme inhibitive assay as the next procedure.

Luciferase-Inhibitive Assay of Each Compound (Resveratrol (1), Caged Resveratrols (2–5), and Photoirradiated Caged Resveratrols)
To a solution
mixture containing 0.1 M dithiothreitol (1.0 μL), 10 μM
ATP (0.5 μL), 5 mg/mL firefly luciferase (0.025 μL), 20×
reaction buffer (2.5 μL), and Ultrapure water (35.975 μL)
(using an ATP determination kit) in a 96-well white plate, 10 μL
of each compound solution (5 μM) was added. Next, a 20 μM
luciferin solution (50 μL) was added to each sample in a 96-well
white plate (the final concentration of caged resveratrol was 0.5
μM, containing 10% DMSO) for the luciferin–luciferase
reaction. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 5 min, and
then CL was measured at 570 nm using a luminometer (SPECTRARluor Plus).
In Figures 5 and 7, error bars indicate the standard deviation.
