The
development of antifouling membranes plays a vital role in
the widespread application of membrane technology, and the hybridization
strategy has attracted a significant amount of attention for antifouling
applications. In this work, TA/PEI@TiO2 hierarchical hybrid
nanoparticles (TPTi HHNs) are first synthesized through a simple strategy
combining the multiple catechol chemistries of phenolic tannic acid
(TA) with the biomimetic mineralization chemistry of titania. The
TPTi HHNs are used as nanofillers to prepare PVDF/TPTi hybrid membranes.
The TPTi HHNs endow the membrane with higher porosity, hierarchical
roughness, greater hydrophilicity, and underwater superoleophobicity.
Upon TPTi HHN loading, the PVDF/TPTi hybrid membranes exhibit enhanced
antifouling performance. The flux recovery ratio can reach 92% when
utilized to separate oil-in-water emulsion. Even being applied to
the three-cycle filtration of oil-in-water emulsion with much higher
concentration, the PVDF/TPTi membrane can still maintain a high flux
recovery ratio about 85%. This study will provide a facial polyphenol-based
platform to fabricate antifouling hybrid nanofillers and antifouling
hybrid membranes with promising applications in oil/water separation.

1 Introduction
In
recent years, the massive discharge of oily wastewater has run
counter to the concept of sustainable use of resources.1 Emulsified oil from oily wastewater greatly restricted
the efficient treatment of oily wastewater via traditional oil/water
separation techniques due to their small oil droplet size (less than
20 μm), strong system stability, high concentration, and wide
scope.2,3 From the aspects of wastewater reuse, environmental
protection, and sustainable development, it is very necessary to search
for simple, efficient, low-energy-consumption and eco-friendly solutions
for oily wastewater treatment. Ultrafiltration membrane separation
technology for oily wastewater treatment shows priorities in all of
the above requirements, especially in its effective removal of emulsified
oil from oily wastewater.4 However, owing
to the inherent oleophilic properties of the common polymers for preparing
ultrafiltration membranes, such as poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF),
polysulfone (PSf), polyethersulfone (PES), and so on, the conventional
ultrafiltration membranes generally have high affinity with oil foulants.
Thus, oil spreading and adsorbing easily take place on the surfaces
of traditional membrane materials and cause serious membrane fouling.5 Therefore, the development of antifouling ultrafiltration
membranes has become a prerequisite for the application of membrane
technology in oily wastewater treatment.

Hybrid membranes derived
from polymer matrixes and nanomaterial
fillers (nanofillers) have drawn considerable attention for membrane
material engineering because of their exceptional membrane hydrophilicity,
antifouling ability, permeability, mechanical properties, and so on.6 For developing antifouling ultrafiltration membranes,
the design of nanomaterial fillers can provide more diversity to refine
membrane properties for antifouling purpose. Various nanofillers with
inherent hydrophilicity and dimension variety have been introduced
into the polymeric membrane matrix, generally including inorganic
nanofillers, organic nanofillers, and inorganic/organic hybrid nanofillers.
Inorganic nanofillers such as TiO2 nanoparticles/nanotubes,7−9 ZrO2 nanoparticles,10,11 ZnO nanoparticles,12 SiO2 nanoparticles,13 Mg(OH)2 nanorods,14 carbon nanotubes,15,16 graphene oxide nanosheets,17 and MOF nanoparticles18−20 were directly
blended into membrane matrixes and proved to be effective in improving
the membrane hydrophilicity and antifouling ability. However, the
direct blending of inorganic nanofillers usually suffers from two
major issues of agglomeration and poor compatibility between inorganic
nanofillers and membrane-forming polymers, which are harmful to membrane
properties and performance.21 Organic nanofillers
such as polydopamine nanoparticles22 were
also added into membrane casting solution of hybrid membranes. The
compatibility between the membrane-forming polymers and the organic
nanofillers was enhanced, and the agglomeration was limited. Recently,
inorganic/organic hybrid nanofillers (IOH-nanofillers) have attracted
considerable attention and were believed to combine the merits of
both inorganic nanofillers and organic nanofillers. For the design
of IOH-nanofillers, popular approaches force decorating hydrophilic
polymers onto the surface of inorganic nanoparticles.23,24 Our previous work also synthesized nanoparticles with a zwitterionic
shell layer on a TiO2 nanoparticle core as IOH-nanofillers
for antifouling hybrid membranes.25 However,
in this strategy, the hydrophilic merit of inorganic moieties could
not be profoundly exploited with the inorganic cores embedded in organic
shells. For exerting fully the role of both inorganic nanofillers
and organic nanofillers, hierarchical hybrid nanoparticles (HHNs)
with inorganic nanoparticles decorated on organic nanoparticles will
become another promising class of IOH-nanofillers for preparing hybrid
membranes. The unique structures of HHNs can not only better combine
the excellent hydrophilic property of inorganic moieties and the interfacial
compatibility of organic moieties but also provide hydrophilic hierarchical
structures to hybrid membranes for enhanced antifouling properties.
However, HHNs are rarely used as IOH-nanofillers for preparing antifouling
hybrid membranes. The complex synthesis process can be one of the
main roadblocks. The breakthrough will possibly rely on the facial,
low cost, and scalable synthesis of HHNs through an advanced chemical
process.

Catechol chemistry has attracted widespread interest
and is available
to engineer functional materials using polyphenols as starting materials.26 Tannic acid (TA) is a natural dendritic polyphenol
that contains five digalloyl ester groups covalently attached to a
central glucose core.27 TA can serve as
a versatile building block for preparing various nanomaterials with
a rich and complex spectrum of physical and chemical properties because
of their important chemical versatility including self-polymerization,
formation of an electrostatic interaction polyplex, and metal ion
complexation.28 As a catechol derivative,
TA can be oxidized and further oligomerized in mildly alkaline solutions
to form nanoparticles or thin films with adhesive capacity in a manner
that is similar to polydopamine formation.29 As an anionic polyelectrolyte, TA can form polyelectrolyte complexes
with cationic polyelectrolytes via strong electrostatic interactions.30 As a phenolic ligand, TA can chelate metals
where it acts as a polydentate ligand for the coordination of metallic
oxide nanoparticles.31−33 These unique features render TA a powerful tool for
functional nanomaterial engineering. It should be mentioned that the
TA chemistry, different from dopamine or other chemistries, possesses
more synthetic routes, faster deposition/assembly rate, lower cost,
more eco-friendly features, and greater availability.9 Thus, TA chemistry may offer a simple and effective strategy
in the preparation of HHNs as IOH-nanofillers for hybrid membranes.

In this study, taking advantage of the facile and versatile TA
chemistry, a novel hierarchical hybrid nanoparticle was synthesized
and mixed with PVDF to fabricate hybrid membranes for antifouling
purposes. First, the TA/PEI nanoconjugates (TA/PEI NCs) formed rapidly
via the strong electrostatic complex between anionic TA and cationic
PEI and then covalently cross-linked into TA/PEI nanoparticles (TA/PEI
NPs) in alkaline solutions. Then, the TiIV–TA coordination
favored the biomimetic mineralization of TiO2 nanoparticles
on the TA/PEI NPs, and thus TA/PEI@TiO2 hierarchical hybrid
nanoparticles (TPTi HHNs) were obtained. The obtained TPTi HHNs were
incorporated into PVDF as IOH-nanofillers to prepare PVDF/TPTi hybrid
membranes via the phase inversion method. The effects of TPTi HHNs
on membrane morphology, chemical composition, surface hydrophilicity,
surface energy oleophobicity, and permeation performance were evaluated.
In addition, the nanoenhanced antifouling property of the PVDF/TPTi
hybrid membranes was assessed and discussed in terms of their resistance
to oil fouling with time for oily wastewater separation.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Formation Mechanism of
TPTi HHNs
Figure 1a describes
the fabrication mechanism of the TPTi HHNs. Firstly, due to the strong
electrostatic interaction, anionic TA and cationic polymer PEI dispersed
in aqueous solution could quickly form the polyelectrolyte TA/PEI
nanoconjugates when they are mixed together.34 With the addition of sodium hydroxide, the solution environment
was changed to alkaline, which could trigger the oxidation and self-polymerization
reaction of TA and form a large amount of quinone groups. PEI had
a higher cation density, and the reactive secondary amino group of
PEI could easily undergo Michael addition or Schiff base reaction
with the quinone group to form the cross-linked TA/PEI nanoparticles.35−37 The large number of phenolic hydroxyl groups led to TA–metal
chelating features and promoted chelating sites for Ti4+ ions. This metal coordination was beneficial to the biomimetic mineralization
of titania. The amino group in PEI adsorbed and concentrated with
the negatively charged Ti-BALDH, and hydrogen bonding between Ti–OH
of Ti-BALDH and the lone electron of nitrogen in PEI favored the nucleophilic
substitution of the Ti–O bonds with adjacent Ti-BALDH molecules.38 Subsequent polycondensation of the titanium
precursor led to the in situ formation of TiO2 nanoparticles.
The complexation of Ti4+ ions with TA molecules contributed
to the acceleration of the polycondensation and the anchorage of TiO2 nanoparticles on the TA/PEI nanoparticles. The TPTi HHNs
were thus synthesized and could be directly introduced into the casting
solution to fabricate hybrid membranes.

of TPTi HHNs and (b) preparation process
of PVDF/TPTi hybrid membranes.

2.2 Characterization of TPTi HHNs
Field
emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to present the
surface morphology of the synthesized nanoparticles. As shown in Figure 2a, the TA/PEI nanoconjugates
formed by electrostatic interaction had a relatively smooth surface,
and its particle size was around 20 ± 11 nm. With the oxidation
and self-polymerization reaction of tannic acid and the Michael addition
reaction with PEI, the particle size of TA/PEI nanoparticles becomes
larger (Figure 2b),
reaching about 43 ± 13 nm. Figure 2c shows the synthesized TPTi HHNs, and the overall
particle size was around 64 ± 20 nm. It could be seen that the
surface of the particle had a large number of punctiform spheres,
which proved to be TiO2 nanoparticles, so the TPTi HHNs
became rough and hierarchical compared with the forward TA/PEI nanoconjugates
and TA/PEI nanoparticles.

nanoparticles (TA/PEI NPs), and (c) TPTi HHNs. (d) FTIR spectra for
TA, PEI, TA/PEI NCs, TA/PEI NPs, and TPTi HHNs. (e) TEM image of TPTi
HHNs. (f) XRD patterns of TPTi HHN and commercial powder of TiO2 nanoparticles.

The successful synthesis of TPTi HHNs was confirmed by Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of TA, PEI, TA/PEI nanoconjugates,
TA/PEI nanoparticles, and TPTi HHNs, which are presented in Figure 2d. The FTIR spectra
of TA molecules presented a C=O peak at 1702 cm–1 alongside some characteristic peaks of phenolic OH peaks between
3600 and 3000 cm–1.39 The peak at 1447 cm–1 was attributed to symmetrical
stretching vibrations of the carboxyl groups. Besides, the N–H
stretching from −NH2 groups was at 3200–3400
cm–1, the C–H stretching from −CH2 groups was at 2936 and 2833 cm–1, the N–H
bending from −NH2 and −NH groups was at 1581
cm–1, and the in-plane bending vibration peak of
−CH2 was at 1466 cm–1; all of
the above peaks were derived from PEI. Similarly, the CH2 and C=O peaks could be both found in TA/PEI nanoconjugates
and TA/PEI nanoparticles. The peaks at 1504 and 1581 cm–1 could be ascribed to NH2 and N–H, all of them
also appearing in both TA/PEI NPs and PTA/PEI NPs. The smaller peaks
of phenolic OH peaks indicated the electrostatic interaction between
TA and PEI. It could be seen that new peaks arise at 1665 cm–1 due to C=N (Schiff base reaction) and C=O (quinone)
in TA/PEI nanoparticles.40 The NH2 complex or pyrogallol–Ti4+ coordination appeared
around 1330–1550 cm–1, and Ti–O–Ti
stretching vibration appeared around 500–700 cm–1 in TPTi HHNs.41 The above infrared spectrum
results were consistent with the reaction mechanism.

The high-resolution
transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) image
of TPTi HHNs (Figure 2e) showed ultrasmall nanocrystals (3–5 nm) with a spacing
of 0.35 nm corresponding to d101 of the
anatase TiO2 crystal phase. The crystal phase of TiO2 nanoparticles on TPTi HHNs produced by biomimetic mineralization
was further confirmed by XRD diffraction, and the result is shown
in Figure 2f. The preferred
orientation corresponding to the (101) plane was observed for TPTi
HHNs and commercial powder of TiO2 NPs; all of the peaks
in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrograph could be indexed to the
anatase phase of TiO2, and the result is consistent with
the TEM image.

To further explore the formation mechanism of
TPTi HHNs, X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on TPTi HHNs. Figure 3a shows the XPS wide-scan
spectra of TPTi HHNs; the main peaks exhibited by the particles at
284.6, 401, and 531.3 eV were from C 1s, N 1s, and O 1s, respectively.
The appearance of the Ti 2p peak at 415 eV meant that there was a
titanium component. Figure 3b shows the high-resolution XPS spectra for the O 1s region
of which the major peaks of Ti–O–Ti,
Ti–OH, and C–O (from TA) are observed in the spectra at their typical positions
of 529.8, 531.4, and 532.9 eV, respectively. Moreover, Figure 3c shows the high-resolution
XPS spectrum of the N 1s region of TPTi HHNs, and the existence of
the C=N bond proved that a Schiff base reaction of amino groups
and quinone groups occurred, which was in accordance with the FTIR
results. From the Ti 2p core-level photoelectron spectrum (Figure 3d), Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks were observed at binding energies
of 459.4 and 465.1 eV, respectively, and were assigned to Ti4+ species in the TPTi HHNs.42 The XPS results
demonstrated that TPTi HHNs were successfully synthesized, which was
consistent with previous analysis.

spectrum of the (b) O 1s,

2.3 Characterization of PVDF/TPTi Hybrid Membranes
PVDF/TPTi hybrid membranes were fabricated incorporating TPTi HHNs
into the PVDF matrix via the phase inversion method. The structures
of the PVDF membrane and PVDF/TPTi hybrid membranes were studied using
SEM. As seen in Figure 4, all membranes showed a typical porous structure with a uniform
pore distribution and a pore size of approximately 40 nm. Figure 4a shows the SEM images
of the PVDF membrane, which was relatively clean and smooth. After
the TPTi HHNs were added to the casting solution, the particles could
be clearly seen on the surface of the PVDF/TPTi hybrid membranes.
The number of particles on the surface of PVDF/TPTi hybrid membranes
also increased with the TPTi HHN loading increasing. Using the image
processing tool (ImageJ) on the SEM images of the membrane top surface,43 the surface porosity data of the membrane was
obtained (Figure 4f).
The total porosity (gravimetric method) of different membranes is
shown in Figure 4f.
The total porosity and surface porosity of the membranes were increased
with increasing TPTi HHN loading. This suggests that the TPTi HHNs
in membrane casting solution could promote the exchange rate of solvent
and water during the phase inversion and promote pore forming.44

porosity and total porosity data of the PVDF/TPTi hybrid membranes.
The insets in the pictures show the enlarged SEM images of membranes.

Figure 5 shows the
cross-sectional SEM images of the pure PVDF membrane and PVDF/TPTi
hybrid membranes doped with different contents of TPTi HHNs. The cross-sectional
image of membranes showed a typical asymmetrical structure including
a dense skin layer supported by large cavity structures in the sublayer.
Compared with the pure PVDF membrane, with the TPTi HHN loading increasing,
the volume of the cavity in the sublayer in the PVDF/TPTi hybrid membranes
gradually increased. During the phase inversion process, the pore
former PEG could be dissolved and diffuse in water (nonsolvent) and
form the growth point of the pores. The further diffusion of water
(nonsolvent) into the channels inside the membrane favored the growth
of large cavities in the membrane matrix in the subsequent process.
Ti element analysis with the cross-sectional EDX mapping image of
PVDF/TPTi-10 (Figure 5f) demonstrated that the TPTi HHNs were successfully loaded onto
the PVDF/TPTi-10 hybrid membrane with homogeneous distribution. The
evenly distributed TPTi HHNs have greater potential to further improve
the permeability and hydrophilicity of PVDF/TPTi hybrid membranes.
In addition, the hybrid membranes exhibited excellent mechanical properties,
despite the large cavity structures in the sublayer (Figure S1).

and (e) PVDF/TPTi-10. (f) Ti element analysis with the cross-sectional
EDX mapping image of the PVDF/TPTi-10 membrane.

To describe the changes in topography and roughness of membranes,
AFM imaging was performed at multiple locations across the sample. Figure 6 shows tapping mode
AFM images of the PVDF membrane and hybrid membranes loaded with TPTi
HHNs from 2.5 to 10% at a scan size of 3 × 3 μm2. The PVDF membrane had a mean surface roughness (Ra) of 32.1 nm,
and the Ra of PVDF/TPTi-2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 membranes were 36. 7,
44. 3, 50. 1, and 53. 8 nm, respectively. Similar to the mean surface
roughness data, the data of the root-mean-square roughness showed
an increasing trend as the dose of TPTi HHNs increases. The Rq of
the PVDF/TPTi-10 membrane reached 68.2 nm. This was mainly attributed
to the migration of TPTi HHNs to the membrane surface during the phase
separation process, which was in good agreement with SEM results.
Moreover, the effect of porosity on membrane roughness was also negligible.
The changes in the surface roughness of membranes showed a positive
correlation with changes in the surface porosity (Figure 4f). The morphology and roughness
of membrane surface were of great importance for the antifouling performance
of the membrane. The TPTi HHNs induced hierarchical bulge structures
on the surface of PVDF/TPTi membranes, which would play an indispensable
role in resisting oil fouling.

TPTi HHN loadings: (a)

PVDF/TPTi-10. (f) Surface roughness of the PVDF/TPTi hybrid membranes.

FTIR and XPS were used to verify
the surface chemical composition
of the PVDF membrane and PVDF/TPTi hybrid membranes. The FTIR spectra
results of membranes are presented in Figure 4a. The peaks at 1400, 1178 and 878, and 838
cm–1 were assignable to −CH2,
−CF2, and vibration of the crystal phase absorption
peak, respectively. These peaks were characteristic peaks of PVDF.
A new peak was observed at 1660 cm–1 in the spectra
of the PVDF/TPTi hybrid membranes, which was attributed to the C=N/C=O
stretching vibrations of PTA/PEI@TiO2 TPTi HHNs. The result
was consistent with the FTIR spectra image of TPTi HHNs. With the
increase in the loading of TPTi HHNs, the intensity of the C=N/C=O
stretching vibrations peak was also increased, indicating that the
TPTi HHNs were indeed introduced into the membrane system. According
to the XPS wide spectra in Figure 7b, the PVDF membrane exhibited some peaks at 284.6,
531.2, and 684.0 eV, and these peaks were attributed to C 1s, O 1s,
and F 1s, respectively. To compare, the PVDF/TPTi hybrid membranes
displayed new peaks of N 1s and Ti 2p, which were located at 401.2
and 455.9 eV, demonstrating that there were TPTi HHNs distributed
on the surface of the membrane, which corresponded to the SEM results.

spectra for the PVDF membrane and PVDF/TPTi hybrid membranes
loaded with TPTi HHNs from 2.5 to 10%, and (b) XPS wide-scan spectra
of the PVDF membrane and the PVDF/TPTi-10 membrane.

To demonstrate the wettability of the membranes,
time-dependent
water contact angles of the PVDF membrane and PVDF/TPTi hybrid membranes
were investigated (Figure 8). The water contact angle of the pristine PVDF membrane was
about 95°, and little change was observed for the water contact
angle after 90 s, demonstrating the high hydrophobicity. PVDF/TPTi
hybrid membranes exhibited smaller original water contact angles,
with the decrease rate gradually improving as the loading of nanoparticles
increased. The contact angle of PVDF/TPTi-10 was only 72° after
90 s, which was 20° smaller than that of the PVDF membrane, indicating
that the hydrophilic feature of TPTi HHNs could endow the hybrid membranes
with better hydrophilicity. The Ti–OH groups located on TPTi
HHNs were beneficial to attracting water molecules to form hydration
microdomains on membrane surfaces, which was better able to enhance
hydrophilicity. The increased surface energy of PVDF/TPTi hybrid membranes
from 30.4 (PVDF membrane) to 40. 9 mJ/m2 could also be
attributed mainly to the strengthened interaction between water molecules
and membrane surfaces. The higher surface energy and hydration structures
promised to improve the antifouling tendency of PVDF/TPTi hybrid membranes.
The underwater oil contact angles of the PVDF membrane and the PVDF/TPTi
hybrid membranes are shown in Figure 8c. The underwater oil contact angles increased from
126.4° for the PVDF membrane to 161.8° for the PVDF/TPTi-10
membrane. The TPTi-induced hydration microdomains on membrane surfaces
could prevent the oil droplet from spreading on the membrane surfaces.
Therefore, the introduction of TPTi HHNs endowed the membrane with
a superoleophobic ability to repel oil droplets.

energy and (c) underwater oil contact angles of the PVDF membrane
and PVDF/TPTi hybrid membranes loaded with TPTi HHNs from 2.5 to 10%.

2.4 Filtration
and Antifouling Performance of
PVDF/TPTi Hybrid Membranes
Considering oils are the common
contaminant in wastewater, emulsified hexadecane was chosen to investigate
the anti-oil-fouling performance of the membranes. Figure 9a depicts the time-dependent
fluxes of the PVDF membrane and the PVDF/TPTi hybrid membranes during
oil/water emulsion filtration. Three steps to form the filtration
recycles are as follows: (1) 30 min of deionized water permeation,
(2) the filtration of emulsified hexadecane (1 h), and (3) hydraulic
cleaning for a short period of time and testing the permeation again
with pure water for 30 min. It could clearly be seen that with the
addition of TPTi HHNs, the flux of the PVDF/TPTi hybrid membranes
increased from 248.8 L/m2 h for the PVDF membrane to 278.3
L/m2 h for the PVDF/TPTi-10 membrane. This result was because
the membrane formation process can benefit from the introduction of
HHNs by increasing the connectivity between the holes and the number
of surface pores for greater hydrophilicity permeation flux.45 During emulsion filtration (Figure 9a), the flux sharply reduced
in the beginning because of the oil deposition and spreading. However,
by comparing with the PVDF membrane, the flux decline rates of PVDF/TPTi
hybrid membranes were significantly reduced, which was primarily because
the underwater oleophobicity of the hybrid membrane was improved.
After being subjected to hydraulic cleaning, the membranes exhibited
different extents of flux recovery upon TPTi HHN loading. Because
the membranes had submicron pore size, all membranes exhibit more
than 99.9% rejection of emulsified oil. The initial oil/water emulsion
was milky with numerous micrometer and submicrometer oil droplets,
and the permeate became transparent after filtration. No droplets
could be observed in the corresponding optical microscopy images after
the separation, which further confirmed the high separation efficiency
of the membrane (Figure S2).

Figure 9 Time-dependent
fluctuation of pure water flux and oil/water emulsion
filtration flux in three cycles and corresponding antifouling parameters:
(a, b) PVDF membrane and PVDF/TPTi hybrid membranes with different
TPTi HHN loadings for 1 g/L oil/water emulsion filtration and (c,
d) PVDF/DA membrane and PVDF/TPTi-10 membrane for three-cycle filtration
of 5 g/L oil/water emulsion.

The calculated FRR, Rt, Rr, and Rir were
used as the
main parameters to investigate the anti-oil-fouling performance of
the membrane. The results are shown in Figure 9. Obviously, by comparing with the PVDF membrane,
all hybrid membranes exhibited lower Rir and higher FRR. Among the hybrid membranes, the PVDF/TPTi-10 membrane
had the best antifouling performance with FRR as high as 92% and Rir as low as 8%. Nevertheless, the FRR and Rir of the PVDF membrane were 73 and 27%. The
total flux decline ratio of the PVDF/TPTi-10 membrane was 26% as compared
to the 39% Rt of the PVDF membranes. This
result illustrated that the PVDF/TPTi hybrid membranes have a good
anti-oil-fouling performance. To provide insight into the mechanism
of the oil-in-water emulsion separation, a schematic illustration
of the proposed antifouling mechanism is provided in Figure 10. The oil droplets were rejected
by the submicrometer porous skin layer. The Ti–OH groups located
on TPTi HHNs were beneficial to attracting water molecules to construct
a stable hydrated sheath to prevent oil adhesion.46,47 In addition, the TPTi HHNs favored the formation of hydration microdomains
around the hierarchical bulge structures on the surface of PVDF/TPTi
membranes, which made the oil surface adhesion occur in a thermodynamic
inverse state and further reduced the contact/fouling sites among
oil droplets and the membrane surface.48 The anti-oil-fouling performance of PVDF/TPTi hybrid membranes was
due to the synergistic effect of the above factors.

Figure 10 Schematic illustration
of the antifouling mechanism of hybrid membranes
during oil/water separation.

To investigate the durability and reusability of the membrane
with
good anti-oil-fouling performance, we used 5 g/L emulsified hexadecane
as a model foulant and implemented a three-cycle filtration test,
the results of which are shown in Figure 9c,d. After three cycles of testing, the flux
recovery of the PVDF membrane was as low as 66%, indicating that the
performance of the PVDF membrane was significantly influenced by oil
fouling. In contrast, the PVDF/TPTi-10 membrane can reach a flux recovery
rate of 86%. The results of three-cycle fouling demonstrated the excellent
stability and durability of the PVDF/TPTi membranes.

3 Conclusions
In this study, TPTi HHNs were synthesized
and introduced into a
PVDF casting solution to prepare antifouling PVDF/TPTi hybrid membranes
by means of a phase inversion method. The incorporation of hydrophilic
TPTi HHNs into the PVDF matrix endowed the PVDF/TPTi hybrid membranes
with higher hydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity, thus
improving the antifouling performance of the membranes. In general,
when the content of TPTi HHNs is 10 wt %, the PVDF/TPTi-10 hybrid
membrane has superior performance: a pure water flux as high as 278.3
L/m2 h, a rejection of emulsified oil of more than 99.9%,
and upon separating the 1 g/L emulsion, a flux recovery ratio up to
92%. Moreover, good and reliable stability and durability of the antifouling
property of PVDF/TPTi membrane (flux recovery ratio higher than 85%)
was also observed for long-term operation with emulsified hexadecane
(5 g/L) after three cycles. Therefore, the detailed results highlighted
that this work provided a candidate strategy for the design of an
antifouling hybrid membrane based on hierarchical hybrid nanoparticles.

(DI) water (≤5 μS cm–1) was produced
using a two-stage reverse osmosis system.

4.2 Preparation
of TA/PEI@TiO2 Hierarchical
Hybrid Nanoparticles (TPTi HHNs)
TA (0.2 g) and PEI (50 mg)
were each dissolved in water (50 mL). Then, the two solutions were
mixed together, and a milky dispersion of TA/PEI nanoconjugates (TA/PEI
NCs) was obtained. Afterward, 0.8 mL of NaOH (1 mol/L) was added to
the TA/PEI NC dispersion. The dispersion was further stirred at room
temperature for 3 h at 300 rpm, and a dispersion of TA/PEI nanoparticles
(TA/PEI NPs) was obtained. Finally, Ti-BALDH (0.5 mL) was added to
the TA/PEI NP dispersion. After further stirring for another 2 h,
the dispersion of TPTi HHNs was thus obtained. Figure 1 presents a schematic diagram of the preparation
procedure of TPTi HHNs. The prepared TPTi HHNs were characterized
by FTIR, SEM, and X-ray diffraction (XPert Pro).

4.3 Fabrication of Hybrid Membranes
The
nascent PVDF membrane and hybrid membranes were fabricated in a coagulation
bath by nonsolvent-induced phase inversion (NIPS):49 First, given precise amounts of TPTi HHNs based on the
weight of polymer and PEG were dispersed in NMP to prepare a homogeneous
mixture under ultrasound treatment for 30 min. After sonication, PVDF
was led into the solution by mechanical stirring at 60 °C for
6 h. To guarantee that the bubbles in the casting solution were sufficiently
removed, the solution was left to settle at 25 °C for more than
8 h. The casting solutions were cast onto glass plates using a casting
knife with a gap height of 200 μm and immediately immersed in
a deionized water coagulation bath at 25 °C. Finally, the obtained
membranes were washed repeatedly with deionized water and soaked in
deionized water. Different membranes were made by changing the loading
of the TPTi HHNs. The proportion of various components constituting
the casting solution is described in Table 1. The resulting hybrid membranes with TPTi
HHN loading (based on the weight of polymer) amount of 2.5, 5, 7.5,
and 10 wt % were named PVDF/TPTi-2.5, PVDF/TPTi-5, PVDF/TPTi-7.5,
and PVDF/TPTi-10, respectively. The pristine membrane was named PVDF.

Table 1 Proportion of Various Components Constituting
the Casting Solution
 	casting
solution compositions (wt %)	
membranes	PVDF	PEG	TPTi HHNs	NMP	
PVDF	1	0.8	0	8.20	
PVDF/TPTi-2.5	1	0.8	0.025	8.175	
PVDF/TPTi-5	1	0.8	0.05	8.15	
PVDF/TPTi-7.5	1	0.8	0.075	8.125	
PVDF/TPTi-10	1	0.8	0.1	8.1	
4.4 Membrane Characterization
The obtained
hybrid membranes were characterized by field emission scanning electron
microscopy (FESEM, HitachiS-4700) to ascertain cross-sectional and
surface morphology. Atomic force microscopy (AFM, Dimension Icon)
was carried out to characterize the surface roughness of hybrid membranes
(scan area range of 3 μm × 3 μm). The chemical structures
of the PVDF membrane and PVDF/TPTi HHNs were characterized by Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Nicolet iS50) and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS, KRATOS AXIS ULTRA). The static water contact angles
of the membrane surface were determined using a JC2000C contact angle
goniometer. The reported contact angle values and standard deviations
were based on at least five measurements of each membrane. The total
surface tension (γs) of membrane surfaces and the
polar (γsp) and dispersive (γsd) components were quantified using the Owens,
Wendt, Rabel, and Kaelble method employing two probe liquids (water
and diiodomethane) with known surface tension component parameters.50 1   2  where θ refers to the
contact angle of water and diiodomethane and γl,
γld, and
γlp represent
total, polar, and dispersive surface energy of the test liquid, respectively.
The total porosities of the hybrid membranes were measured via gravimetric
method by the following formula 3  where ε (%) is the porosity
of the membrane, Ww (g) is the wet sample weight Wd (g) is the dry sample weight, ρw (g/cm3) is the density of pure water, A (cm2) is the area of membrane in the wet state, and δ0 (cm) is the thickness of the membrane in the wet state.

4.5 Filtration Performance of the Hybrid Membranes
The dead-end filtration cell (Amicon UFSC05001 Millipore Co., effective
area of 13.4 cm2) was used to test the permeation of the
prepared membranes at a transmembrane pressure of 0.05 MPa. Before
the test, all samples were filtered with deionized water for at least
30 min (0.05 MPa) for compaction and stabilization. The pure water
flux J1 (L/(m2 h)) is defined
by the following equations 4  where V (L)
is the volume of permeated water, A (m2) is the membrane effective area, and Δt (h)
is the permeation time.

4.6 Oil-in-Water Emulsion Preparation
and Separation
Experiment
Hexadecane and water were mixed in a ratio of
1:99 (v/v) with the addition of 1 g/L SDS. The mixed solution was
ultrasonicated for 30 min to obtain an oil-in-water emulsion with
a drop size of about 300 nm (Figure S3).
Dynamic light scattering with Zetasizer Nano ZS90 (Malvern, UK) was
used to characterize the droplet sizes and size distributions of oil-in-water
emulsions. To obtain the J0 (L/(m2h)) of membranes, the deionized water was poured into the
dead-end filtration cell and tested for 30 min, followed by oil-in-water
emulsion for the next 60 min, and the flux of oil-in-water emulsions
(J1) was recorded, Then, the membranes
were cleaned with DI water for 30 min, and lastly the flux of the
cleaned membrane (J2) was measured again
for another 30 min with DI water.

The flux recovery ratio (FRR),
the total flux decline ratio (Rt), reversible
flux decline ratio (Rr), and irreversible
flux decline ratio (Rir) of membranes
were calculated using eqs 5, 6, 7, and 8 to evaluate their antifouling properties:51 5   6   7   8  The separation efficiency
(R, %) of the hybrid membranes was calculated using
the equation 9  where Cp (g/L) is the oil concentration of the permeating
solute and Cf (g/L) is the oil concentration
of the feed
solute. The concentrations of oil-in-water emulsion were quantified
using TOC (TOC-LCPH).
