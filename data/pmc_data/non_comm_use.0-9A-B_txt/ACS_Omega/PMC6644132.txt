An
efficient NMR approach is described for determining the chemical
structures of the monosaccharide glucose and four disaccharides, namely,
nigerose, gentiobiose, leucrose and isomaltulose. This approach uses
the 1H resonances of the −OH groups, which are observable
in the NMR spectrum of a supercooled aqueous solution, as the starting
point for further analysis. The 2D-NMR technique, HSQC-TOCSY, is then
applied to fully define the covalent structure (i.e., the topological
relationship between C–C, C–H, and O–H bonds)
that must be established for a novel carbohydrate before proceeding
to further conformational studies. This process also leads to complete
assignment of all 1H and 13C resonances. The
approach is exemplified by analyzing the monosaccharide glucose, which
is treated as if it were an “unknown”, and also by fully
assigning all the NMR resonances for the four disaccharides that contain
glucose. It is proposed that this technique should be equally applicable
to the determination of chemical structures for larger carbohydrates
of unknown composition, including those that are only available in
limited quantities from biological studies. The advantages of commencing
the structure elucidation of a carbohydrate at the −OH groups
are discussed with reference to the now well-established 2D-/3D-NMR
strategy for investigation of peptides/proteins, which employs the
−NH resonances as the starting point.

Introduction
In recent years, there
has been considerable interest in deciphering
the various biological roles of carbohydrates, and as a result, it
is now well established that carbohydrates are involved in a multitude
of biological processes, including cell–cell recognition, differentiation,
and adhesion processes.1 Despite the importance
of carbohydrates in biology, the determination of their covalent structure—the
topological relationship between C–C, C–H, and O–H
bonds that defines the ordering of these atoms within a molecule—remains
a challenging analytical problem. NMR spectroscopy is the most powerful
analytical technique currently available for determining the covalent
structure of small organic molecules in solution;2 however, the 1H NMR spectroscopic analysis of
a sugar is compromised because the hydrogen signals from the C–H
units of the carbohydrate backbone normally occupy only a small portion
of the full range of all possible 1H chemical shifts (δH 3–5.5 ppm from the full range of 0–10 ppm).
Chemical shifts in the 13C NMR spectrum of a carbohydrate
follow the same general trends as for 1H NMR spectroscopy,
although the probability of “accidental overlap” is
less because the dispersion of 13C shifts (δC 60–110 ppm) is approximately 20 times wider in the 13C NMR spectrum (full range: 0–220 ppm).

There
is a strong imperative to avoid accidental overlap because
it leads to ambiguities in the logical process by which the interpretation
of an NMR spectrum is made, which can quickly make structure elucidation/complete
NMR assignment impossible. For the limited dispersion in a 1H NMR spectrum, the probability of accidental overlap is normally
reduced by spreading the chemical shift information out over a second
dimension, for example, through application of a 2D experiment3 in which 1H is correlated with 13C, such as heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy
(HSQC). In the standard 2D-NMR approach to determining the covalent
structure for a small organic molecule of unknown structure,4 HSQC is used to create CH, CH2 and
CH3 “jigsaw pieces”, which are then connected
to one another by “longer range” techniques, such as
heteronuclear multiple bond coherence spectroscopy (HMBC) and proton
correlation spectroscopy (1H–1H COSY)
that depend on coupling through chemical bonds. In addition to determining
the planar structure of the unknown, this strategy also results in
a full set of NMR assignments. These assignments are an absolute requirement
for the final stage of the process of structure elucidation for a
small molecule, in which through-space connections, often established
by nuclear Overhauser spectroscopy (NOESY), are used to assign both
relative configuration at stereocenters and to define geometrical
isomerism at double bonds. For oligosaccharides, a complete 3D description
can also include aspects of molecular conformation that are dictated
by weaker intramolecular forces, such as hydrogen bonding between
−OH groups, which may also be determined by NOESY5 and other techniques.6−9

This strategy can be successful
for the elucidation of the chemical
structure of oligosaccharides of unknown constitution consisting of
up to 3–8 monosaccharide units, when implemented with a high-field
NMR spectrometer. This limit is a consequence of the accumulation
of ambiguities for the through-bond connections made by HMBC and COSY
in the standard strategy. This is, in turn, a result of the increasing
probability of accidental overlap of both 13C and 1H resonances. One plausible strategy by which current limitations
to the determination of the covalent structure of an oligosaccharide
might be overcome would be to increase the dimensionality of the NMR
experiment still further. Thus, if the resonances from an oligosaccharide
could be spread out over a 3D volume instead of a 2D area, then the
probability of accidental overlap would be even further diminished.
This strategy has been applied with great success to the structure
determination of proteins by NMR. The primary structure of a protein
is usually known in advance, so a well-established suite of 3D-NMR
techniques, such as HNCO, HNCA, and HN(CO)CA,10 is used to “connect” three different nuclei (1H, 13C and 15N) in the backbone of this 13C/15N doubly labeled protein to provide only an
unambiguous assignment of all NMR resonances. This is then the cornerstone
for the routine study of the secondary and tertiary structures of
proteins that can consist of hundreds of amino acids. Although 3D-NMR
has been described for oligosaccharides,11 it has not found widespread application, partly because it is impractical
to include a third nucleus for a carbohydrate, which consists only
of the elements C, H, and O, where 17O is quadrupolar12 and therefore unsuited for high-resolution NMR
studies. In addition, unlike proteins, it is difficult to completely
enrich a carbohydrate with 13C, and the non-availability
of uniformly 13C-labeled carbohydrates severely limits
the possibilities of pulse sequence design.

An alternative strategy
to improve 1H dispersion would
be to include the hydrogens from the −OH groups of a carbohydrate
in the analysis.13 In this approach, the 1H chemical shifts of −OH groups would serve as an alternative
starting point for structural assignment and the resolution between
−OH resonances might be further increased by a 2D-NMR experiment
that correlated their chemical shifts with the 13C resonances
of the carbons to which they are attached. Unfortunately, the hydroxyl
resonances of a sugar are not normally seen when its 1H
NMR spectrum is acquired in D2O solution at room temperature
(as is standard practice) because the −OH groups undergo rapid
chemical exchange with 2H in the aqueous solvent. Two approaches
are described in the literature to render these hydroxyl groups visible.
The first is to acquire the NMR spectrum in an alternative solvent,
such as dry d6-DMSO.2,13−16 The limitation here is that hydrogen bonds in organic solvents do
not necessarily mirror the hydrogen bonds formed in aqueous solution,
and the approach is therefore of questionable value for structural
studies of biologically active oligosaccharides, which should be made
under physiologically relevant conditions. The second option is to
acquire the NMR spectrum from a supercooled aqueous solution,17−20 in which the rate of −OH exchange has been slowed sufficiently
that the hydroxyl groups can be resolved.a Most
investigators consider this to be the better alternative because it
favors the observation of more stable conformations already present
in aqueous solution; however, both techniques have found quite considerable
application in conformational studies of hydrogen bonding.21−33 Because there are also some precedents for using supercooled aqueous
solutions in NMR structural studies of biologically active proteins
and RNA,34−36 we have adopted this second approach, when exploring
this alternative to the conventional NMR strategy for determining
the covalent structure of carbohydrates in solution. We have probed
the feasibility of using this alternative technique for elucidation
of the chemical structure of the monosaccharide glucose, which is
treated as if it were an unknown. We have also applied this approach
to make full assignments of the NMR spectra of four disaccharides.
It is proposed that this strategy could be extended to larger oligo-
and polysaccharides of both known and unknown structure.

Results and Discussion
Under standard 1H NMR acquisition conditions (e.g.,
at room temperature for a sample contained in a 5 mm NMR tube), the
−OH groups of a carbohydrate undergo rapid exchange with deuterium
in the D2O solvent, becoming converted to −OD groups,
which are not visible in the spectrum. Therefore, to be able to use
the −OH groups as a starting point for making NMR assignments
of the covalent structure of a carbohydrate, the effects of such exchange
have to be minimized. We have sought to achieve this in two ways:
(i) by adopting the NMR spectrometer with the highest magnetic field
strength available to us (this increases the frequency separation
between exchanging species, thereby reducing the extent of associated
line broadening) and (ii) by minimizing the deuterium content of the
solvent. For the 700 MHz/TCI cryoprobe system employed in this study,
it was possible to prepare samples in H2O solutions that
contained as little as 1% D2O, which was the minimum quantity
of deuterium compatible with locking and shimming for this system.

Reducing
the Rate of −OH Exchange
The rate of
−OH exchange was lowered by decreasing the temperature, while
preventing the solution from freezing by maintaining it in a supercooled
state in a capillary. Thus, for the above NMR system, we were routinely
able to obtain NMR spectra from a 100 mM solution of glucose at −14
°C (259 K), when that solution was contained in a 0.7 mm i.d.
capillary NMR tube. The reduction in the rate of exchange as the temperature
is lowered toward −14 °C is illustrated by the gradual
appearance of the −OH peaks from both α- and β-anomers
of glucose in the 1H NMR spectra that are displayed in Figure 1. Although there
are a few examples in which −OH groups have proved useful for
NMR studies at or above the normal freezing point of water,5,9,37 most investigators have chosen
to explore supercooled solutions at temperatures below 0 °C,
which lead to a further sharpening of the −OH peaks. One consequence
of this sharpening in the present study is that it was possible to
acquire each of the HSQC-TOCSY spectra in a relatively short period
of time (40 min). Hence, it is possible to collect all five of the
2D data sets that are required for the efficient approach described
below in a reasonable time frame, even when the unknown carbohydrate
is only available in limited quantities, for example, when isolated
from a biological source.

Figure 1 700 MHz 1H NMR spectra of a 100 mM
solution of glucose,
prepared in 1% D2O/99% H2O and contained in
a single 0.7 mm i.d. capillary. Spectra were recorded at (a) 18 (291),
(b) 8 (281), (c) −2 (271), (d) −7 (266), (e) −11
(262), and (f) −14 °C (259 K).

The topmost 1H NMR spectrum (Figure 1a), which was acquired at 18
°C (291
K), exhibits only those peaks that are normally observed for glucose,
that is, several strongly overlapped multiplets for the methine (CH)
and methylene (CH2) protons between δH 3–5.5 ppm. When this NMR sample is cooled to 8 °C (281
K; Figure 1b), a new
set of extremely broad peaks become barely discernible in the range
δH 5.5–8.5 ppm. The 1H NMR spectra
in Figure 1c–f
were recorded from supercooled aqueous solutions of glucose at −2
(271), −7 (266), −11 (262), and −14 °C (259
K), respectively. These spectra show a progressive sharpening of the
“new” resonances between δH 5.5–8.5
ppm as the temperature is lowered to −14 °C (Figure 1f). In addition,
there is a steady increase in chemical shift for all peaks in this
range as the temperature is reduced.26 Both
observations are consistent with identification of the new resonances
between δH 5.5–8.5 ppm with the −OH
protons of glucose.

Improving the Quality of the NMR Spectrum
from a Supercooled
Capillary
Various solvent suppression techniques were investigated
to reduce the 1H NMR signal from the 99% H2O
solvent, which is off-scale for all spectra in Figure 1. Of these, excitation sculpting38,39 had the least effect on the exchangeable −OH protons in glucose,
as is shown in Figure 2.b Excitation sculpting has therefore been
applied routinely to all NMR spectra reported herein. The quality
of the spectrum in Figure 2 was further improved by packing three capillaries (1 mm o.d.)
inside a standard 3 mm NMR tube to compensate for the relatively poor
signal-to-noise ratio from the small amount of glucose that is contained
within an individual NMR capillary tube.

Figure 2 700 MHz 1H
NMR spectrum with solvent suppression by
excitation sculpting, acquired from three 0.7 mm i.d. capillaries,
packed inside a 3 mm NMR tube at −14 °C (259 K). As previously,
the sample is a 100 mM solution of glucose in 1% D2O/99%
H2O.

Improving the Resolution
between the −OH Groups
Nine broad singlets are resolved
between δH 5.5
and 8.5 ppm in the supercooled 1H NMR spectrum of Figure 2, corresponding to
the ten hydroxyl protons that are expected from the two anomers of
glucose (i.e., 1-OH, 2-OH, 3-OH, 4-OH, and 6-OH for both α-
and β-forms), with just one “double” overlap at
δH 6.48 ppm for 3-OH(α) and 4-OH(α).
The resolution for these −OH groups is significantly superior
to the C–H protons between δH 3.0 and 5.5
ppm, for which only six resonances can be clearly identified,c with the remaining eight C–H protons appearing
as four pairs of overlapped (sometimes strongly second-order) multiplets
(i.e., H-5(α)/H-6(α), H-3(α)/H-6(β), H-3(β)/H-5(β),
and H-4(α)/H-4(β) in Figure 2). Complete resolution of all 10 −OH
groups in glucose can be achieved by introducing a second dimension,
via the 2D-NMR experiment HSQC-TOCSY.40,41 As shown in Figure 3, the 1H resonance of every −OH group becomes correlated with the 13C chemical shift of the carbon to which that −OH group
is attached, resulting in 10 clearly distinguished 2D C–OH
peaks. This 2D experiment confirms that the 3-OH(α) and 4-OH(α)
resonances were accidentally overlapped at δH 6.48
ppm in the 1D 1H NMR spectrum of Figure 2 and all 10 peaks have been represented within
the 10 “jigsaw pieces” in Figure 3. It is these jigsaw pieces that will constitute
the starting point for the enhanced approach to structural elucidation
of carbohydrates, which is discussed in the next subsection.

Figure 3 Expansion (δH 5.5–8.5 ppm in F2) of the
700 MHz HSQC-TOCSY spectrum of a solution of glucose in 1% D2O/99% H2O, supercooled to −14 °C. The corresponding
(1D) 1H NMR spectrum appears horizontally on top, and the
(1D) 13C NMR spectrum appears vertically on the left-hand
side. The 10 2D peaks have also been represented within 10 jigsaw
pieces. Ambiguities due to accidental chemical shift overlap in 13C have been indicated by i in two of these
jigsaw pieces and by i for 1H overlap in a further two
OH pieces. Two exceptional transfers over three hydrogen atoms of
a coupled network have been indicated by arrows on the spectrum itself.

The HSQC-TOCSY experiment is able
to “edit” a 1H NMR spectrum by sequentially
relaying coherence from a C–H
unit to all the other protons in a mutually coupled network. Glucose
consists of two giant coupled networks (one for each anomer), comprising
all C–H and −OH protons in the molecule.42 The TOCSY mixing time41 employed in Figure 3 has been set to a relatively short value (8 ms) to relay coherence
only between hydrogens that are bonded to adjacent nuclei but no further
along the network. This is the optimum condition for identifying the
five H–C–O–H systems that reside within each
anomer of glucose. In each case, coherence is being relayed from the
C–H proton (δH 3–5.5 ppm, which is
not shown in the expansion of Figure 3, but see Figure 4) to its associated −OH group (δH 5.5–8.5 ppm in the expansion of Figure 3) at the edited 13C chemical shift
of the carbon of the C–H unit.

Figure 4 Expansion (δH 3.0–5.5
ppm in F2) of the
700 MHz HSQC spectrum of glucose in 1% D2O/99% H2O, supercooled to −14 °C. The 14 2D peaks (4 of which
are not fully resolved) are represented as constituents of 12 jigsaw
pieces, in which ambiguities due to accidental chemical shift overlap
for both 1H (C–H) and 13C have been indicated
by i, ii, iii, iv and v.

Inclusion of −OH Groups in the Jigsaw Pieces Used for
Chemical Structure Determination by NMR
As explained in the Introduction, the standard 2D-NMR approach to solving
the structure of an unknown organic compound begins with an HSQC experiment,2−4 which identifies all directly bonded 1H and 13C resonances via their large one-bond coupling constant (1JCH), and thereby defines all the CH,
CH2, and CH3 pieces of a jigsaw (so called because,
once connected to one another in the correct fashion, they define
the planar covalent structure of the entire molecule). The HSQC spectrum
of supercooled glucose (Figure 4) illustrates the creation of such pieces in the traditional
strategy for which each C–H proton is correlated with the carbon
to which it is directly attached.

The HSQC experiment can be
thought of as editing the C–H protons by the 13C
chemical shift of their attached carbons, in much the same way that
HSQC-TOCSY edits the −OH groups, as described above. Note,
however, that the introduction of the second dimension is insufficient
to overcome all instances of accidental overlap between the 14 C–H
resonances, for which both the 3(β)/5(β) pieces and the
4(α)/4(β) pieces remain unresolved, as indicated by the
annotation “Double C-H overlap: 4” in Figure 4. This stands in contrast to Figure 3, in which all 10
−OH protons have been resolved from one another.

Because
the carbon chemical shifts for the C–H units in Figure 4 are the same as
for the C–OH units in Figure 3, it is obviously possible to combine these two sets
to create a new jigsaw unit, which is referred to as a H–C–OH
piece in Figure 5 (six
for each anomer). The advantage of doing this is that there are now
twod1H chemical shifts available
for each of the new pieces, and hence, whenever the proton spectrum
suffers from poor dispersion, the shift that is better resolved can
be selected for further analysis. For example, in the case of glucose,
it is clear that the −OH resonances are better resolved than
the C–H resonances for both anomers, as has been indicated
directly in Figures 2–4. The more abundant β-anomer
of glucose has been chosen in the next section to illustrate the enhanced
approach for structure elucidation and accompanying NMR assignment,
in which these H–C–OH jigsaw pieces are assembled by
making connections between −OH chemical shifts in preference
to C–H groups, as practiced in the standard strategy.

Figure 5 The 12 H–C–OH
jigsaw pieces used in the enhanced
NMR approach for determining the chemical structures of β- and
α-glucose, which are treated as unknowns in the next section.
Accidental chemical shift overlaps for 13C and 1H in a C–H unit are indicated by i, ii, iii, iv and v; accidental overlap within −OH is indicated by
i.

Using −OH Groups
To Assemble the NMR Jigsaw for the β-Anomer
In the
traditional NMR approach to structure elucidation, C–H
jigsaw pieces must be assembled into the full molecular structure
using other 2D-NMR techniques,2−4 which make connections between
C–H units over more than one bond. The two most important such
long-range experiments are HMBC,43 which
relies on 2JCH and 3JCH couplings, and 1H–1H COSY,44 which primarily identifies 3JHH couplings. In the alternative
approach described herein, the mixing time of the HSQC-TOCSY experiment
is made progressively longer to achieve the same purpose. Increasing
the HSQC-TOCSY mixing time increases the maximum number of bonds over
which coherence can be relayed between hydrogen atoms in a coupled
network. This is illustrated in Figures 6, 7, and 8 for mixing times of 25, 45, and 60 ms, which are
sufficient to transfer coherence between up to three, four, and five
hydrogen atoms, respectively. This results in the appearance of several
new 2D peaks, in addition to those already described in Figure 3, and the new correlations
appearing in the spectral region δH 5.5–8.5
ppm connect each of the H–C–OH pieces to the other −OH
groups.

Figure 6 Expansion (δH 5.5–8.5 ppm in F2) of the
HSQC-TOCSY spectrum of 100 mM glucose in 1% D2O/99% H2O supercooled to −14 °C. At the longer mixing
time of 25 ms, coherence is relayed between up to three hydrogen atoms,
forming a coupled network. This allows −OH chemical shifts
to be linked by horizontal lines, thereby connecting together adjacent
H–C–OH pieces of the NMR jigsaw.

Figure 7 Expansion (δH 5.5–8.5 ppm in F2) of the
HSQC-TOCSY spectrum of glucose in 1% D2O/99% H2O supercooled to −14 °C at an even longer mixing time
of 45 ms. Coherence is now relayed between up to four hydrogens, forming
a coupled network. This allows −OH chemical shifts to be linked
by horizontal lines, thereby connecting together H–C–OH
units separated by one intervening piece. It is not known which of
the 6-CH2 protons initiates correlation F, and the selection
of δH 4.01 over δH 3.83 ppm is arbitrary.45

Figure 8 1H NMR assignments of the 10 −OH resonances (red)
and 14 C–H resonances (bold) for the α- and β-anomers
of glucose (100 mM) in a supercooled solution (−14 °C)
in 1% D2O/99% H2O, as determined by the enhanced
NMR approach. 13C resonances common to these two sets of
protons are shown below the corresponding 1H assignments
for the C–H groups. Accidental chemical shift overlaps for 13C and 1H resonances in C–H units are indicated
by i, ii, iii, iv, and v; accidental chemical shift overlap
for −OH resonances used in the alternative approach has been
indicated by i.

In this section, we use
these correlations to piece together the
structure of glucose, as if it were a carbohydrate of unknown composition,
to illustrate the potential of the enhanced approach. The anomeric
C–H protons are generally selected as the starting point for
commencing analysis of a carbohydrate in the standard strategy because
they are few in number (one per monosaccharide) and their chemical
shift range (δH 4.5–5.5 ppm) does not overlap
with other methine and methylene protons (δH 3–4.5
and 3–4 ppm, respectively). The same is true for the anomeric
−OH protons in the alternative approach, and the resonance
at δH 8.07 ppm can be confidently identified with
the anomeric position of the more abundant (β) anomer in Figures 2, 3, and 5. [Note that the carbon chemical
shift at the anomeric position of a carbohydrate (δC 85–110 ppm) is also consistently higher than the rest of
the molecule (δC 60–85 ppm).]

The horizontal
arrow A that connects the 1(β) anomeric piece
(Figure 3) with the
new correlation for 2-OH(β)e at the edited 13C chemical shift of C-1(β) in Figure 6 then defines a direct connection between
the 1(β) and the 2(β) piece, which must therefore be located
adjacent to the anomeric center, as shown by the topmost “jigsaw
assembly” in Figure 6. New peak B, at the chemical shift of 1-OH(β) and C-2(β),
confirms the connectivity between these same two −OH groups,
with coherence being relayed in the opposite direction. Similarly,
the two “reciprocal” correlations between the new peaks
labeled C and D indicate that the 2(β) piece should, in turn,
be connected with the 3(β) piece. A fifth correlation labeled
E could represent a further ongoing connection from the 3(β)
piece to 4(β), but this is a tentative conclusion (as indicated
by the dotted lines for 4(β) in the bottom jigsaw assembly in Figure 6) because the carbon
chemical shifts of C-3(β) and C-5(β) are accidentally
overlapped (Figures 4 and 5). Hence, correlation E could equally
well represent a connection between the 5(β) and 4(β)
pieces. The decision would rest on the observation of a reciprocal
correlation from the 4(β) piece to 3-OH(β), which is unfortunately
absentf from this particular spectrum, although
it does make an appearance in Figure 7 at the longer mixing time of 45 ms.

In conclusion
then, the effect of increasing the HSQC-TOCSY mixing
time from 8 to 25 ms is to link the three H–C–OH jigsaw
pieces 1(β), 2(β), and 3(β) unambiguously into a
larger piece, based on the four correlations, labeled A–D in Figure 6. No further TOCSY
correlations are expected for the right-hand side of this large piece,
which represents the anomeric carbon, with a divalent oxygen atom
for the unresolved linkage. The 4(β) piece has been tentatively
attached to the left-hand side (dotted lines), in anticipation of
the results of HSQC-TOCSY experiments with longer mixing times that
produce additional unambiguous correlations, as described below.

Further extension of the mixing time to 45 ms allows coherence
transfers to be made between as many as four hydrogen atoms in a coupled
network. Thus, the three new peaks that appear in Figure 7, which have been connected
by arrows labeled A′, C′, and D′, serve to confirm
the full structure already proposed above for the larger piece in Figure 6. Arrows A′
and D′, which are the continuations of arrows A and D in Figure 6, form a pair of
reciprocal correlations that represent connections between 1(β)
and 3(β) separated by an intervening piece (topmost jigsaw in Figure 7). The arrow labeled
as C′ represents a similar “skipped” connection
from 2(β) to 4(β), which confirms that piece 4(β)
should indeed have been included at the left-hand side of the large
piece in Figure 6 (now
represented by solid lines in Figure 7). The ambiguity for this connection has disappeared
because neither the 13C chemical shift for piece 2(β)
nor the −OH chemical shift for 4-OH(β) suffers from accidental
chemical shift overlap. Most importantly, however, this longer mixing
time provides the means by which the (6β) CH2–OH
piece from Figure 5 can also be included in the NMR analysis via the correlation labeled
F, which connects 4-OH(β) with 6-OH(β) at the 13C chemical shift of C-6(β), as shown at the bottom left of Figure 7. Note that this
final connection can be made even though there is no −OH group
in the intervening 5(β) piece because coherence is still being
relayed (over four hydrogen atoms) through the C–H proton at
the 5-position.

The observation of this last connection completely
defines the
carbon backbone of the unknown because the two large pieces established
in Figure 7 share the
4β unit in common. All that remains is to connect the two unsatisfied
valencies between the 1(β) and 5(β) pieces to define the
pyranose form of an aldohexose sugar, for which 5-OH has performed
an intramolecular nucleophilic attack at C-1 to create a hemiacetal
functional group at the anomeric position of this monosaccharide.
The logical process that resulted in this covalent structure also
generated the accompanying set of full NMR assignments that are shown
in Figure 9. These
could be used to fully identify the molecule as β-glucopyranose,
based on additional NOESY data and/or an analysis of 3JHH coupling constants. For example, the coupling
constants for H-1(β) (δH 4.76 ppm, d) and H-2(β)
(δH 3.35 ppm, dd)—the only two ring protons
to be resolved for the β-anomer in Figure 2—are all approximately 9 Hz. Hence,
H-1(β), H-2(β), and H-3(β) must all be axial in
the chair conformation shown in Figure 9.

Figure 9 Expansion (δH 5.5–8.5 ppm in F2)
of the
HSQC-TOCSY spectrum of 100 mM glucose in 1% D2O/99% H2O supercooled to −14 °C at the very long mixing
time of 60 ms. Coherence is now relayed between up to five hydrogen
atoms in a coupled network.

Further extension of the HSQC-TOCSY mixing time results in
the
establishment of successively more distant linkages between H–C–OH
pieces, such as that revealed by correlation A″ at a very long
mixing time of 60 ms in Figure 8.

At these extremely long mixing times, nearly allg the −OH groups in a coupled network can be
connected
by a series of horizontal arrows for the carbon chemical shift at
which coherence transfer was initiated. This is illustrated in Figure 10 for the α-anomer
of glucose at a mixing time of 90 ms, in which bold labels B, C, and D (which first appeared at a mixing
time of 25 ms); A, D′, and F (45 ms); and A′ (90 ms) are the equivalents
of those already described for β-glucopyranose above. Such spectra
provide a simple means for assessing whether or not more than one
coupled network is present; in this particular case, it is obvious
that there are two sets of 13C chemical shifts, one for
the β- and one for the α-anomer of glucose. Note that
these two sets overlap at C-4, which has therefore not been included
in any of the above analyses to avoid introducing an unnecessary further
ambiguity to the structure elucidation/assignment process.

mixing time of 90 ms.

A Comparative Analysis of the Use of CH Resonances To Assemble
the NMR Jigsaw for Glucose
It was anticipated in an earlier
section that the advantage of having constructed H–C–OH
pieces with two 1H chemical shifts per piece would be fully
realized when analyzing long-range HSCQ-TOCSY spectra, because it
would be possible to select from one of two chemical shifts, whichever
is better resolved, when attempting to connect two pieces together.
The H–C–OH pieces allow connections to be made between
−OH groups (via the alternative approach described above) or
between C–H groups (traditional strategy), and we can readily
alternate between the two strategies, as and when accidental overlap
leads to ambiguities in either set of protons. This is illustrated
explicitly in Figure 11 by the expansion of the C–H region of the HSQC-TOCSY spectrum
of glucose at a mixing time of 8 ms, which has been taken from the
same spectrum that is shown in Figure 3, as an expansion of the −OH region (see also Figure S2). It will be recalled that a mixing
time of 8 ms is sufficient to relay coherence between two hydrogens
that are bonded to adjacent nuclei; hence, the expansion of Figure 11 identifies relays
within H–C–C–H units rather than within H–C–O–H
units, as in Figure 3. The new correlationsh that appear in the
C–H expansion of the HSQC-TOCSY spectrum in Figure 11 therefore provide information
about the linkages between adjacent C–H pieces. If glucose
is, once again, treated as an unknown, then the interpretation of
this half of the spectrum is more akin to the first stage of the jigsaw
assembly process between −OH groups that is depicted in Figure 6.

Figure 11 Expansion (δH 3–5.5 ppm in F2) of the HSQC-TOCSY
spectrum of 100 mM glucose in 1% D2O/99% H2O
supercooled to −14 °C. At the mixing time of 8 ms, coherence
is relayed between just two hydrogen atoms in a coupled network, and
C–H chemical shifts linked by horizontal lines connect together
adjacent C–H pieces of the NMR jigsaw.

Thus, the horizontal arrow labeled a in Figure 11, which connects the 1(β)
piece for
the anomeric center with the new correlation for H-2(β) at the
edited 13C chemical shift of C-1(β), mirrors correlation
A in Figure 6. The
reciprocal arrow b confirms this same connectivity with coherence
being relayed in the opposite direction, just like connection B in Figure 6. However, ambiguity
immediately sets in for arrows c and d, the reciprocal correlations
that connect the 2(β) piece to the 3(β) piece (shown by
dotted lines), because both the proton and carbon chemical shifts
for H-3(β) and H-5(β) are accidentally overlapped (Figure 5). Note that this
ambiguity was avoided in the −OH approach because there is
no accidental overlap for 3-OH(β). The situation becomes even
more challenging for correlation e, which is doubly ambiguous because
the chemical shift of H-4(β) is also overlapped with H-4(α).
Again, this was not an issue in the −OH approach, for which
4-OH(β) has a unique chemical shift. Most of the ambiguities
that are caused by the accidental overlap of C–H proton chemical
shifts are resolved as the mixing time of the HSQC-TOCSY experiment
is further extended (see Figures S5–S9, right-hand side). However, on balance, it is the −OH strategy
described in the previous section that offers the more straightforward
approach to the structural elucidation of β-glucopyranose, when
this molecule is treated as an unknown.

The more rapid onset
of ambiguity for the conventional C–H
strategy could have been predicted from the extent of accidental chemical
shift overlap for C–H protons compared with −OH protons,
as indicated directly on the 1D-NMR spectrum of Figure 2 and the 2D-NMR spectra of Figures 3 and 4. The reason that the alternative −OH approach is superior
to the traditional strategy for glucose is that there is less overlap
between −OH protons than between C–H protons in both
1D and 2D. The standard strategy remains essential for explicitly
identifying pieces, such as 5(β), that do not contain an −OH
group (Figure 5) which
can only be inferred by the −OH approach (e.g., bottom left
of Figure 7). It is
also very useful whenever there is accidental overlap between −OH
resonances. For example, 3-OH(α) and 4-OH(α) are overlapped
in the α-anomer of glucose, whereas H-3(α) and H-4(α)
are resolved from one another.

To conclude, the creation of
H–C–OH pieces supplements
the spectral region for C–H protons (δH 3–5.5
ppm) by an additional region for OH protons (δH 5.5–8.5
ppm) and thereby doubles the dispersion of the 1H chemical
shifts that is available for chemical structure elucidation. This
increased dispersion is best utilized by alternating between the −OH
and C–H strategies for determination of covalent structure
described above to overcome challenges resulting from accidental overlap,
whenever it arises in either O–H or C–H chemical shifts.

Nigerose and Gentiobiose
The usefulness of the alternative
approach has been further exemplified below by its application to
the complete 1H and 13C NMR assignments of more
complex systems, such as the four commercially available disaccharides:
nigerose (Glcα1-3Glc), β-gentiobiose (Glcβ1-6Glc),
leucrose (Glcα1-5Fru), and isomaltulose (Glcα1-6Fru; palatinose).
All these disaccharides incorporate glucose, and there is good agreement
between the chemical shifts of −OH groups for glucose itself
(Figure 9) and these
various disaccharides which contain it (Figures 12–15).

and β-anomers for nigerose (Glcα1-3Glc). 13C resonances that are shared by these two sets of protons are shown

right is an expansion of the edited-HSQC spectrum].

Nigerose and β-gentiobiose (Sections S2.2 and S2.3) both exist as a mixture of anomers, just like
the monosaccharide glucose. As for glucose, accidental overlap is
found to be far less severe for the −OH groups than for the
C–H groups in both 1D and 2D NMR, and this is illustrated directly
on the spectra in Figures 12 and 13. Thus, there are 16 −OH
groups in the two anomers of nigerose, 3 of which are triply overlapped
at δH 6.43 ppm [4′-OH(β), 4′-OH(α),
and 4-OH(α)] and 2 of which are doubly overlapped at δH 6.53 ppm [3′-OH(α) and 2-OH(β)], leaving
11 −OH groups that are resolved from one another. This compares
with a complete resolution for just 6 out of 28 C–H resonances
for the same two anomers, in which no less than 8 resonances are crammed
into the region δH 3.80–3.86 ppm [H-3(α),
H-5(α), H-6(α), H-6(α), H-6′(β), H-6′(β),
H-6′(α), and H-6′(α)]. The situation does
not improve greatly after introducing a second dimension, as shown
by the HSQC spectrum of Figure 12, in which more than half of these C–H resonances
remain overlapped. The C–H overlap for gentiobiose (Figure 13) is marginally
less poor, but there can be little doubt that it is easier to elucidate
the structures of both of these disaccharides using the alternative
−OH approach in preference to the traditional C–H strategy.

Furthermore, it is immediately apparent that 8 out of 24 carbons
are not involved in correlations in the −OH region of the HSQC-TOCSY
spectra for either nigerose or gentiobiose (bottom left Figures 12 and 13). There are no quaternary carbons in either disaccharide,
so there must be eight positions in the molecule that do not bear
an −OH group.46 In the case of nigerose,
four of these carbon atoms are associated with the internal oxygens
of the two pyranose rings (δC 78.6 (C-5(β))/74.0
(C-5(α)) and δC 74.3 (C-5′(β))/74.3
(C-5′(α)), which have similar chemical shifts to those
of glucopyranose in the previous section. The remaining four carbons,
which appear as annotations on the 13C projection of the
HSQC-TOCSY spectrum in Figure 12, must be associated with the glycosidic linkage. Two
of these carbons at δC 101.9 and 101.8 ppm are immediately
identifiable as C-1′(β) and C-1′(α) by their
distinctive chemical shifts (anomeric carbons appear in the range
δC 85–115 ppm). The point of attachment for
the other half of the disaccharide can be established once the remaining
two non-hydroxyl-bearing carbons at δC 84.3 and 81.7
ppm are identified as C-3(β) and C-3(α) by application
of the jigsaw assembly approach (it is the C–H strategy that
is required for these units).

The 1,6-linkage in gentiobiose
can be constructed by applying similar
arguments to the HSQC-TOCSY spectrum shown in Figure 13, for which the absence of correlations
to −OH protons at the four methine carbons at δC 71.6 (C-6(β))/71.3 (C-6(α)) and δC 105.5
(C-1′(β))/105.4 (C-1′(α) are associated
with the glycosidic linkage, with the other four (δC 77.7 (C-5(β))/73.2 (C-5(α)) and δC 78.8
(C-5′(β))/78.8 (C-5′(α)) being associated
with the internal oxygen of the pyranose rings in each monosaccharide.

Leucrose and Isomaltulose
The disaccharides leucrose
and isomaltulose (Sections S2.4 and S2.5) are both composed of glucose and fructose and have been included
to illustrate a second kind of “missing” hydroxyl group
that can be encountered in the −OH region of the HSQC-TOCSY
spectrum. Once again, the extent of accidental overlap is less for
the −OH groups than for the C–H groups in 1D NMR of
both disaccharides (as noted directly on the 1H NMR spectra
in Figures 14 and 15) and is quite comparable to that of α- and
β-glucose in glucose itself. The −OH and C–H regions
are completely free from accidental overlap in all the 2D-NMR spectra
of Figures 14 and 15—most probably because both disaccharides
exist effectively in just one anomeric form.

The 1H NMR spectrum of leucrose (Figure 14) presents eight −OH groups in the range δH 5.8–6.6 ppm. It might be inferred from this somewhat
limited dispersion that the glycosidic linkage must be at the C-1′
position of glucose because no −OH resonances are present with
the high chemical shift that is characteristic of the anomeric hydroxyl
group of an aldose sugar [e.g., δH 8.07 and 7.31
ppm for 1-OH(β) and 1-OH(α) in the glucose spectrum of Figure 2]. This inference
is readily confirmed by the enhanced NMR approach, for which there
are five carbons that do not show any correlations in the −OH
region of the HSQC-TOCSY spectrum in Figure 14 (δC 103.4, 101.2, 82.4,
74.8, and 64.8 ppm), with the highest chemical shift corresponding
to the glycosidic linkage at the C-1′ anomeric carbon of glucose.

More interestingly, it is observed that one of the eight −OH
groups in leucrose (2-OH) also does not show any correlation in 2D
HSCQ-TOCSY spectra (or, in fact, in any of the HSQC-TOCSY spectra
in Figures S40–S44). The missing
eighth −OH group must therefore be due to a hydroxyl proton
that is not part of a coupled network; that is, it is attached to
a carbon that lacks a C–H hydrogen in the H–C–OH
piece from which coherence could have been relayed. The quaternary
carbon of the hemiketal group in the ketose moiety of leucrose is
thereby identified by the absence of correlations in HSQC-TOCSY for
both the carbon at C-2 (δC 101.2 ppm) and its attached
2-OH group (δH 6.45 ppm).i

A similar argument can be made to identify the C-2 position in
isomaltulose for which neither the 2-OH group (δH 6.83 ppm) nor its associated quaternary carbon (δC 104.7 ppm) appear at any HSQC-TOCSY mixing time (Figure 15 and Figures S50–S54).i Of the four remaining
carbons that do not bear an −OH group (δC 101.1,
81.7, 74.7, and 70.6 ppm) in the HSQC-TOCSY spectrum of Figure 15, one (δC 70.6 ppm) is easily identified as a CH2O piece
by two negative cross-peaks (colored green rather than blue) in the
corresponding edited-HSQC spectrum shown. The chemical shift of this
CH2O piece is 6–7 ppm higher than all other examples
that appear in this manuscript with the exception of C-6 in gentiobiose
and is therefore consistent with a glycosidic linkage between the
6-position of fructose and C-1′ of glucose (δC 101.1 ppm), which forces the fructose moiety in isomaltulose to
adopt the furanose form.

Conclusions
With this study, it
has proved possible to reduce the rate of exchange
of the −OH protons of carbohydrates, which is fast on the NMR
timescale at ambient temperature, to an appropriate level to determine
the chemical structure of a carbohydrate in aqueous solution, in a
reasonable time frame by the application of five 2D-NMR experiments:
HSQC and HSQC-TOCSY, repeated at four different mixing times (8, 25,
45, and 60 ms). We have shown that, for a high-field 700 MHz NMR instrument
equipped with a cryogenic probe, excellent results can be obtained
from the pivotal HSQC-TOCSY experiment when studying a 100 mM solution
in 1% D2O/99% H2O solvent, which is contained
in a 0.7 mm i.d. capillary that is supercooled to −14 °C
(259 K). Ideally, several such capillaries should be packed together
inside a conventional NMR tube (3 or 5 mm) to improve the signal-to-noise
ratio and/or reduce the acquisition time of NMR experiments. Under
these conditions, the hydroxyl resonances in glucose and glucose-containing
disaccharides appear as broad singlets (or occasionally as poorly
resolved doublets) between the chemical shifts δH 5.5–8.5 ppm. Because this −OH range is distinct from
that of the C–H resonances (δH 3–5.5
ppm), which are the only other hydrogens observable in a carbohydrate,
the dispersion of the proton spectrum is effectively doubled. In addition,
the −OH resonances suffer from less accidental overlap than
the C–H resonances and therefore provide a better starting
point for the structure elucidation/complete assignment of both mono-
and disaccahrides.

The inclusion of −OH groups
in this expedited approach to
determine the covalent structure of carbohydrates finds some parallels
with the now well-exploited NMR structural determination of peptides
and proteins that may contain hundreds of amino acids. Thus, the current
protein NMR strategy also begins with the −NH resonances, which
occupy an even wider range of distinctive chemical shifts (δH 6–10 ppm) for structured proteins. The analysis of
oligosaccharides and polysaccharides is expected to be more complex
than peptides and proteins because there are five OH’s in each
hexose carbohydrate monomer, whereas there is only one −NH
amide linkage between each of the amino acids that constitute the
linear structure of a peptide/protein. The number of OH protons requiring
analysis decreases to four per monomer for a disaccharide connected
by a single glycosidic linkage and to three for a (infinite) linear
polysaccharide with two glycosidic linkages to each constituent monomer.
A unique feature of our alternative approach is that it is also well
suited to identify which hydroxyl group(s) in a carbohydrate monomer
has become involved in the formation of these glycosidic linkages.
It is this variability in glycosidic linkages that is responsible
for the frequently branched and complex structures of oligosaccharides,
and establishing the positions of these linkages is arguably the greatest
challenge in structural carbohydrate chemistry today. By applying
our alternative approach, this can now be achieved by identifying
those carbons that do not bear −OH groups from an absence of
correlations in the −OH region of an HQSC-TOCSY spectrum because
such carbons must either be involved in the formation of a glycosidic
linkage between two monosaccharides or in the formation of a pyranose/furanose
ring within an aldose monosaccharide.j Previously,
the only way to have identified the carbons involved in such glycosidic
linkages would have been via the more laborious, and destructive,
chemical derivatization of an oligosaccharide. This alternative −OH-based
NMR approach should therefore be of value within many areas of chemistry
and glycobiology, where a full understanding of the structure of a
carbohydrate is essential for its subsequent application.

Experimental
All spectra were acquired using a Bruker AVIII 700 MHz instrument
equipped with a TCI cryogenically cooled probe, with temperature regulation
by a VT system able to achieve a minimum stable temperature of −14
°C (259 K). The temperature experienced by the sample was precalibrated
using 99.8% d4-MeOH as an NMR thermometer.47,48

Application
of the Alternative NMR Approach to an Aqueous Solution
of Glucose
Aliquots (15–20 μL) of a solution
of d-glucose in 99% H2O/1% D2O [100
mM, incorporating 0.1 % (w/v) d4-TSP as internal reference]
were transferred to three capillary NMR tubes of 0.7 mm i.d. (Hilgenberg
Part no. 86553), and the solutions were settled by centrifugation.
These capillaries were then packed tightly together inside a 3 mm
NMR tube.

1H NMR spectra were recorded without solvent
suppression (see Figure 1) using 8 repetitions of the Bruker pulse sequence “zg”,
digitized over 65536 points, with a sweep width of 20 ppm centered
at 4.7 ppm, an FID resolution of 0.44 Hz (acquisition time: 2.27 s),
and a recycling delay of 1 s, leading to a total experiment time of
0.5 min. The time data were weighted using a negative exponential
function (line broadening of 0.3 Hz), followed by 1D Fourier transformation
to produce a spectrum consisting of 65536 points. 1H NMR
spectra were also recorded with water suppression by excitation sculpting
(Figure 2) using the
pulse sequence “zgesgp” (see the Supporting Information).

HSQC-TOCSY spectra were recorded
using 16 repetitions of the Bruker
pulse program “hsqcdietgpsisp.2” with 2048 points in
F2 (sweep width 12 ppm, centered at 4.7 ppm) and 128 points in F1
(sweep width 60 ppm, centered at 78 ppm), resulting in an FID resolution
of 8 Hz in F2 and 165 Hz in F1 (total acquisition time: 0.12 s in
F2) and a recycling delay of 1 s, leading to a total experiment time
of 40 min. The time data were weighted using a Qsine function (SSB
= 2) in both dimensions, followed by 2D Fourier transformation with
linear prediction (ncoeff = 16) in the second dimension, producing
a spectrum with 2048 points in F2 and 1024 points in F1. The TOCSY
mixing time of the experiment (d9) was varied as described in Figures 3, 6, 7, 8, and 10.

Application of the Alternative NMR Approach
to Various Disaccharides
Aliquots (17 μL) of a solution
of nigerose (Glcα1-3Glc)
in 95% H2O/5% D2O (1 M, incorporating 0.1 %
(w/v) d4-TSP) were transferred to three 0.7 mm i.d. capillaries,
which were packed together in a 3 mm NMR tube; then, NMR data were
acquired as above. β-Gentiobiose (Glcβ1-6Glc), leucrose
(Glcα1-5Fru), and isomaltulose (Glcα1-6Fru) were analyzed
in the same way.

a A hybrid of
the two techniques has
also been described for aqueous solutions that incorporate an organic
solvent (e.g., 15% d6-acetone/85% H2O), which
are supercooled to between −8 and −12 °C.

b The chemical shift for the H-1(α)
anomeric proton of α-glucose (δH 5.35 ppm)
lies very close to the chemical shift for the water resonance at −14
°C. This signal was therefore unavoidably affected by all the
water suppression techniques that were investigated.

c H-1(α) (δH 5.35
ppm, d, J = 4 Hz); H-1(β) (δH 4.76 ppm, d, J = 9 Hz); one of H-6(β) (δH 4.01 ppm, dd, J = 12, 2 Hz); one of H-6(α)
(δH 3.89 ppm, dd, J = 12, 5 Hz);
H-2(α) (δH 3.64 ppm, dd, J = 10, 4 Hz); H-2(β) (δH 3.35 ppm, dd, J = 9, 9 Hz).

d The
two 1H resonances in
a H–C–OH jigsaw piece are correlated with one another
in the 1H–1H COSY spectrum of a supercooled
solution of glucose (Figure S4). This is a useful experiment if there
is any difficulty in determining which 13C chemical shift
is common to the −OH groups in Figure 3 and the C–H
groups in Figure 4.

e This new
peak is in fact due to coherence
being relayed over three 1H atoms: H-1(β) →
H-2(β) → 2-OH(β), at the edited 13C
chemical shift of the anomeric carbon C-1(β); while, the (previously
identified) 1(β) piece was the result of a relay over just two 1H atoms: H-1(β) → 1-OH(β), at this same
edited 13C chemical shift. The reason that 2-OH(β)
and 1-OH(β) appear to be connected by arrow A is that both transfers
start at H-1(β) (which resides in a region of the HSQC-TOCSY
spectrum not included in the expansions of Figures 3 and 6), and H-1(β)
is edited by the 13C chemical shift of C-1(β). Similarly,
new correlation B is due to a three-hydrogen coherence transfer: H-2(β)
→ H-1(β) → 1-OH(β), edited by the 13C chemical shift of C-2(β).

f While the presence of a correlation
in a 2D-NMR spectrum should always be considered as firm evidence
for the corresponding through-bond connection in a molecule, the converse
is not true: the absence of a correlation does not necessarily imply
the absence of a bonding connection. This is a matter of common experience
when interpreting an HMBC spectrum in the traditional strategy for
small molecules, for which “expectable” 2JCH and 3JCH correlations are frequently discovered to be absent.
The absence of such correlations is not important, so long as there
are sufficient actual correlations for the extension of the NMR jigsaw
to be logically justifiable.

g 6-OH receives significantly weaker
long-range correlations than the other −OH groups and lies
below the threshold set for contour plots at all mixing times (see
also Figures S11–S13). As the only primary hydroxyl group in
glucose, 6-OH is likely to be participating in faster chemical exchange
than the other more sterically hindered secondary hydroxyl groups.
Also, when fully resolved, this −OH proton is expected to be
a double doublet, rather than a doublet. These broadening mechanisms
probably both contribute to the failure of 6-OH to appear as a long-range
correlation in any of Figures 6, 7, 8 and 10.

h That is correlations that are in addition
to those already seen in the HSQC spectrum of Figure 4.

i This conclusion is confirmed by the
absence of any correlations for C-2 in the corresponding edited-HSQC
spectra.

j A third possibility
exists for ketose
sugars, in which the quaternary carbon of the hemiketal functional
group also shows no correlations with its attached −OH group.
However, this can be distinguished from the other two by the absence
of correlations to both −OH and carbon in HSQC-TOCSY.
