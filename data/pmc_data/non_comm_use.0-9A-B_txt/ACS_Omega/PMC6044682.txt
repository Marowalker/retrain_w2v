In
this study, we report the fabrication of aluminum oxide-coated
glass (ACG) slides for the preparation of glycan microarrays. Pure
aluminum (Al, 300 nm) was coated on glass slides via electron-beam
vapor deposition polymerization (VDP),
followed by anodization to form a thin layer (50–65 nm) of
aluminum oxide (Al-oxide) on the surface. The ACG slides prepared
this way provide a smooth surface for arraying sugars covalently via
phosphonate formation with controlled density and spatial distance.
To evaluate this array system, a mannose derivative of α-5-pentylphosphonic
acid was used as a model for the optimization of covalent arraying
based on the fluorescence response of the surface mannose interacting
with concanavalin A (ConA) tagged with the fluorescence probe A488.
The ACG slide was characterized using scanning electron microscopy,
atomic force microscopy (AFM), and ellipsometry, and the sugar loading
capacity, uniformity, and structural conformation were also characterized
using AFM, a GenePix scanner, and a confocal microscope. This study
has demonstrated that the glycan array prepared from the ACG slide
is more homogeneous with better spatial control compared with the
commonly used glycan array prepared from the N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated
glass slide.

Introduction
Glycan microarrays
have been used as an effective tool for the
high-throughput analysis of protein–glycan interactions and
are thus useful for disease diagnosis, drug discovery, and vaccine
development.1−28 Numerous surfaces have
been made available for glycan arraying, including (a) noncovalent
adsorption of sugar derivatives to the surface of a porous nitrocellulose
membrane;1−4,7,9,10,17,22,23,26 metal oxide surface;5 microtiter plate;
fabricated plastics of polystyrene, polypropylene, or polycarbonate;
and polyfluorohydrocarbon-linked aluminum oxide-coated glass (ACG)
slides21 and (b) covalent attachment to
a gold surface or alkenthiol-activated gold surface,6,9−11,22 epoxy-activated glass
slide,6,18,19,22,25N-hydroxysuccinimide
(NHS)-activated glass slide,8−10,14,20,22,24,25 and ACG slide.15,21 The glycan array on ACG slides developed in our laboratory15,21 was prepared by spotting glycan–phosphonic acids onto the
surface of the ACG slides,29−31 and the properties of the arrays
were characterized using both mass spectrometry and fluorescence scanning
microscopy.15,21 The fluorescence intensity of
sugar–protein interaction on the ACG slide was found to be
more sensitive and homogeneous with higher glycan density than that
on the NHS-activated glass slides.14,15 We have further
used the ACG slides to prepare a mixed-glycan array for the study
of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies isolated from HIV patients
and found that some of the antibodies recognized two different glycans
simultaneously; a new observation that was not detected previously
by the use of NHS-activated glass slides.28 In addition, the ACG slide surface can be used for noncovalent hydrophobic
adherence of glycans with a fluorohydrocarbon tail for the identification
and study of enzyme activity analyzed using MALDI mass spectrometry.16,21

Despite all of these studies, the fabrication method for the
preparation
of ACG slides has not been clearly defined. In our previous study,
the anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) surface had properties and functions
similar to those of the native aluminum oxide (NAO) surface.16 Different vapor deposition polymerization (VDP)
techniques have resulted in various degrees of surface roughness.
Even the surface morphology of the ACG slides appeared different from
that of aluminum objects that have been widely used in industry.29,32−38 Previous surface treatment of aluminum objects involved mostly in-depth
anodization for the control of pore sizes but not for the preparation
of glycan microarrays. On the basis of our experience, the AAO surface
to be used in glycan microarrays should have the following properties:
(1) The aluminum oxide (Al-oxide) layer should be smooth enough for
the covalent coupling reaction with sugar derivatives of phosphonic
acid.29,30 (2) The thickness of the Al-oxide layer
on the surface should be adjusted to provide optimal fluorescence
intensity for the detection of the protein–sugar interaction.
In this study, we use the glass slide with electron-beam (E-beam)-coated
aluminum to produce ACG slides with various thicknesses under various
anodization conditions and then study their effect on the fluorescence
intensity in sugar–protein interactions. Mannose with an α-5-pentylphosphonic
acid tail was
used as a model compound for covalent attachment to the Al-oxide layer,
and the fluorescence intensity of Alexa Fluor-488-tagged ConA (ConA-A488)
that interacts with the covalently bound sugar was used to evaluate
and optimize the system. Computer software
was used to design experiments to fabricate the surface with various
thicknesses and roughness of the AAO layer for the study. Data analysis
of the result was conducted mathematically and used for the development
of optimized conditions for the preparation of ACG slides.

To
characterize the ACG slide to be used in a covalent glycan microarray,
sugar loading capacity, uniformity, and spatial distribution of sugar
derivatives on the surface were compared with those on the commercially
available NHS-activated glass slides using atomic force microscopy
(AFM), a GenePix scanner, and confocal microscopes.

Results and Discussion
Glycan microarrays are mostly used to study glycan–protein
interactions with the goal of understanding the nature of the multivalent
interactions between the cell-surface glycans and the proteins they
interact with. Therefore, an ideal
glycan array is one that best mimics the glycans that are found on
living cell surfaces. For example, the density and spatial distribution
of Globo-H on malignant cells and their stem cells of breast cancer
patients progressively increase. To identify the patients who would
benefit from vaccination with the Globo-H vaccine,39 to study the disease progression, and to monitor the antibody
response to the vaccine in vitro, it would be useful if the glycan
arrays were able to mimic the changes on the cell surface at different
stages of the disease. However, there is no such glycan array available
to date as the cell surface is a dynamic and heterogeneous system
with variations in substrates on the surface, and as such the development
of a glycan array to mimic the real cell surface remains a major challenge.
Nevertheless, the preparation of a surface for glycan array in a controllable
and reproducible manner with regard to the distribution, density,
and spatial orientation of glycans is important to address some fundamental
questions such as the avidity of weak binding and multivalent heteroligand
interaction. The glycan array on ACG slides has been shown to meet
these needs.

Surface anodization of aluminum has been used in
numerous industrial
applications mostly in the electrical oxidation of objects for pore
size creation, color-filling, pore-sealing and pore-polishing. The
surface anodization requires the use of strong acid such as sulfuric
acid and long reaction time from hours to days. There are many reports
describing the preparation of anodized Al-oxide surface with pore
structures varying from nanometers to micrometers,29,32−38,40 but little is known about the
preparation of Al-oxide with smooth uniform thickness,36,41 as the ACG slide used for a glycan microarray requires a smooth
surface with low surface roughness.

Before a thorough study
of surface anodization, we screened several
VDP techniques to produce Al-oxide on metal-coated glass slides. These
VDP screening studies included (1) Al-oxide of 50 nm thickness produced
using atomic layer deposition onto the Al-coated (with e-beam evaporation)
glass slide; (2) Al-oxide of 2 nm thickness obtained from direct oxygen
plasma treatment on a 300 nm thick aluminum (with e-beam evaporation)
coated on glass slides; and (3) Al-oxide of 36 nm thickness produced
using magnetron sputtering on the Al-coated (with magnetron sputtering),
the nickel-coated (with e-beam evaporation), or the chromium-coated
(with e-beam evaporation) glass slides. All of these substrates were
examined using the GenePix fluorescent scanner. The original purpose
of screening diversified methods was to create different Al-oxide
microstructures on the surface to identify an optimal way to enhance
the signal. However, the best fluorescence intensity produced from
these slides was the AAO grown on glass slides. Without further investigation
of the VDP techniques, we then focused on the use of E-beam evaporation
with argon plasma to coat a layer of pure aluminum on the glass slide
followed by acid anodization of the aluminum surface. Our pervious
study15 showed that the slide surface roughness
with rms (root mean square) < 18 nm can be used for microarray
printing. Schott’s glass slides provided a smooth surface (rms
0.33–0.42 nm scanned using AFM over 10 × 10 μm2 area) for aluminum coating. The Al-coated glass slides produced
in this way have a smooth surface with a rms of 0.75 nm (for 100 nm)
and 2.33 nm (for 300 nm) of coated aluminum. An optimized AAO surface
gave a rms of 2.31 nm, with surface roughness similar to that of the
Al-coated glass slide. The same results were obtained when glass slides
with higher rms were used for Al-oxide preparation. We believe that
during the electrochemical surface anodization, the electropolishing
process42−44 occurred simultaneously to remove the convex, sharp,
and rough materials from the surface. Therefore, a thin layer of AAO
with surface roughness similar to glass can be prepared under the
optimized surface anodization reaction condition.

Figure 1 shows a
schematic drawing of the fabrication of an ACG slide to be used in
a glycan microarray. The clean 1 mm thick glass slide was coated with
pure aluminum (300 nm) in an argon plasma-assisted E-beam VDP coating
chamber. Surface anodization was conducted via wet electrochemical
reaction. The final optimized ACG slide contains a layer of anodized
Al-oxide (approx. 50–65 nm) as measured using ellipsometry.

Figure 1 Schematic
drawing of ACG slide preparation.

A top view of the scanning electron microscope (SEM) image
(150 000×)
of an AAO surface is given in Figure 2A in which the granular aluminum crystals underneath
could be seen and no pores were created. Unlike those surfaces with
in-depth anodized alumina reported in the literature, the surface
morphology shown in Figure 2A looks similar to a surface with uniform distribution of
a thin layer of transparent Al-oxide. Figure 2B shows the cross section SEM image (80 000×)
of the sandwich-like ACG slide. Its surface roughness, as shown in Figure 2C, scanned over 10
× 10 μm2 using AFM was similar to the ordinary
glass (<3 nm). In glycan microarray preparation, dispensing one
droplet (0.6 nL per spot) of sugar solution wetted out an area of
approximately 150 μm in diameter, which covers approximately
750 times the surface area, as shown in Figure 2A.

analysis with image statistics (rms: 2.3 nm) of the optimized AAO
surface over 10 × 10 μm2 area analyzed using
AFM.

To produce a smooth AAO surface,
the anodization was conducted
via electrochemical reaction, by placing the Al-coated glass slide
in an oxalic acid aqueous solution in a 4 °C incubator at controlled
voltage and reaction time. A 10 L oxalic acid solution (0.3 M) was
prepared in stock to complete the entire study. As shown in Figure 1, the beaker (600
mL) was filled up with the electrolyte, and the acid solution was
collected separately and reused.

We found that it is difficult
to make a nontransparent Al-oxide
layer with an Al-coating thickness of just 100 nm. Visually, we can
see that the substrate fabricated from the 100 nm Al-coated glass
slide was semitransparent. Therefore, Al-coated glass slides with
300 nm of aluminum have been used in all surface anodization experiments.
As can be seen in the cross section image in Figure 2B, part of the aluminum has been converted
into Al-oxide. The final Al thickness was greater than 200 nm, and
the substrate was nontransparent.

Figure 3 shows a
molecular model of mannose/ConA-A488 binding. Mannose with an α-5-pentylphosphonic
acid tail was covalently bound to the surface of the ACG slide. The
ConA-A488 (c11252 from Invitrogen) was bound specifically to the immobilized
mannose. Con A is a lectin tetramer with a subunit dimension of 42
× 40 × 39 Å3, and each subunit has a mannose
binding site.45,46 Geometrically, only two binding
sites per tetramer are available for mannose binding. The most effective
mannose/ConA-A488 binding produces the strongest fluorescence intensity,
and we have been using the fluorescence intensity of mannose/ConA-A488
binding to tailor-make the Al-oxide surface for the glycan microarray.15 Designed experiments were used to optimize the
preparation of ACG slides for glycan microarray.

Figure 3 Molecular model of mannose/ConA-A488
binding. Mannose with α-5-pentylphosphonic
acid was covalently bound to the ACG slide surface. Fluorescence-tagged
concanavalin A (ConA-A488) was then bound to mannose specifically.
Con A is a lectin tetramer with subunit dimension of 42 × 40
× 39 Å3. Each subunit has a mannose binding site.
Geometrically, only two binding sites per molecule are available for
mannose binding. The most effective mannose/ConA-A488 binding should
give the strongest fluorescence intensity, and this model system has
been used to optimize the AAO surface for the glycan microarray.

An optimized ACG slide should
possess a smooth glasslike AAO layer,
thus mild conditions for making the AAO surface have been selected
for investigation. By keeping the reaction temperature consistently
low (at 4 °C) and constant acid solution concentration (at 0.3
M), the voltage and the reaction time were the only two reaction variables.
To screen the reaction parameters, two sets of experiments were conducted
using the computer software program Design Expert 8.0 (Supporting Information).

With the information
obtained from the first two sets of designed
experiments (as shown in the Supporting Information), we are now able to define the ranges of voltage (9.8–45.2
volts) and reaction time (71.4–198.6 s) for the RSM (response
surface measurement) experiment. The slides fabricated under these
conditions were used to array mannose solution to form a 10 ×
12 array matrix with sugar concentration ranging from 100 mM to 1
pM. These experiments have essentially established the response in
fluorescence intensity resulting from sugar/protein binding. For comparison,
an NHS-activated glass slide was arrayed simultaneously using the
in-house synthesized mannose derivative of α-pentoxylamine21 and was used to interact with the same ConA-A488
(c11252 Invitrogen) protein solution (3 μg/mL) for the binding
intensity study.

The results of response measurements are shown
in Table 1. A total
of 13 Al-coated glass
slides were used in this set of experiments. The second and third
columns are variable ranges of voltage and reaction time. The fourth
to seventh columns are the measured data of AAO thickness, electrical
current, fluorescence intensity of arrayed mannose (100 μM)
solution with ConA-A488 binding, and maximum binding intensity (Bmax) for each glass slide prepared. The Bmax in column 7 of Table 1 was estimated using the fluorescence intensity
obtained from 1 μM to 100 mM with GraphPad Prism 5.0. All mathematical
models for each response measurement are given in Table S5.

Figure 4A shows
the changes in electrical current and voltage versus reaction for
ACG slide no. 5 (Exp. number 5). The results of other slides are given
in the Figure S3A. Figure 4B shows the images of a 10 × 12 matrix
with 10 repeated spots, with each column of the mannose solution concentration
varied from 100 mM to 1 pM across the row (also shown as ACG slide
no. 5 in Figure S3B).

from 100 mM to 1 pM. (C) Response surface of the modified quadratic

to 100 mM) derived from model fitting, YBmax = a × V + b × V2 (with significant P value) given in Table S5. Both (D) and
(E) show an optimal curvature of high fluorescence intensity within
the range of this study.

Figure 4C
shows
the response surface with respect to voltage and reaction. The AAO
thickness is transformed into a modified quadratic function of voltage
and reaction time with YAAO thickness = a × (V)1/2 + b × (RT)1/2; intercept ≠ 0. The modified
quadratic mathematical functions of “bioactivity” (i.e.,
the fluorescence intensity and Bmax) with
respect to the fabrication factors (voltage and reaction time) are
shown in Figure 4D,E.

Both Figure 4D (derived
from experimental data) and 4E (derived from
theoretical calculation) have shown similar curvatures, indicating
that an optimal curvature of high fluorescence intensity within the
range of this study, there indeed existed reaction condition(s) for
making ACG slides, which produced the highest fluorescence intensity.
Additional data of the ACG slide arrayed with various sugar concentrations
are given in Figure S4.

Figure 4D shows
an example of the fluorescence intensity with 100 μM sugar concentration
arrayed on the ACG slide surfaces. The response surfaces of all sugar
solution concentration (as shown in Figure S4) were derived from the modified quadratic models (given in Table S5), with math equations either Yintensity = a × V + b × V2; intercept = 0, or Yintensity = a × (V)1/2 + b × (V2)1/2; intercept = 0, suggesting that voltage is
a critical variable in making “good” ACG slides. From
the fluorescence intensity data, the voltages and reaction times used
for making the optimized ACG slides are thus defined.

Figure 4E shows
the response surface of Bmax with respect
to reaction conditions. To identify the optimal ACG slide surface
for the highest fluorescence intensity, Bmax was derived from the Michaelis–Menten’s equation,47Y = (Bmax × X)/(Kd + X), where Y is the specific
ligand/protein binding [expressed as the fluorescence intensity of
mannose solution concentration (varying from 1 μM to 100 mM)
arrayed on each ACG slide surface used in this system] and x is the concentration of the specific ligand (mannose)
that binds to ConA-A488. Bmax and Kd for each slide were obtained from GraphPad
Prism. Model fitting of Bmax (using Design
Expert) turned out to be YBmax = a × V + b × V2 (as given in Table S5). Both Figure 4D (derived from experimental data) and 4E (derived from theoretical calculation) have shown similar curvatures,
indicating that an optimal curvature of high fluorescence intensity
within the range of this study, there indeed existed reaction condition(s)
for making the ACG slides, which gave the highest fluorescence intensity
of the same sugar/protein binding system.

As shown in Figure S3C (using the model
fitting shown in Table S5), the electrical
current is also derived as a function of voltage, Ycurrent = a × V + b × V2; intercept
≠ 0. This derived mathematical equation has been deviated from
the theoretical prediction of linearity. As the ACG slide made at
high voltages, its electrical current did not reach equilibrium and
continually drifted upward; the model deviated from the theoretical
prediction (Ycurrent = a × V) is an indication of the heat-sink issue
before large-scale anodization.

The predicted AAO thickness
for optimal intensity is given in Table 2. As indicated, the
thickness for optimal fluorescence turned out to be 55 nm (±11
nm), and the predicted value using Bmax was 52.4 nm with the standard deviation of ±0.3 nm. Nonetheless,
the curvatures of the optimal regions in Figure 4D,E have been quite flat, suggesting that
the best AAO surfaces can be made within the ranges of the reaction
conditions (voltages and reaction times).

As shown in Table 2, an optimized ACG slide contains a layer
of AAO with 50+ nm on the
surface. It also showed that the optimized reaction conditions for
making ACG slides are voltage between 25.8 ± 0.7 volts and reaction
time between 135 ± 21 s. The reaction temperature was set constantly
at 4 °C using freshly prepared and up to the third repeated use
of 0.3 M oxalic acid aqueous solution. Figure 5 shows the thickness variations of the AAO
layer versus the electrical current under the suggested optimized
reaction conditions (25.8 volts, 121 s). With the glass slides obtained
from different suppliers (Schott and Arrayit), 30 slides were fabricated
(one slide at a time repeatedly) under this optimized reaction condition
using either freshly prepared or up to the sixth repeated use of the
oxalic acid solution. The surface roughness of the starting glass
base material (with rms 0.33–0.42 nm and 0.47–3.89 nm
for the glasses obtained from Schott and Arrayit, respectively) affected
the final rms (2.31 vs 4.56 nm) but not the thickness of the AAO layer.
A few outliers in Figure 5 were obtained, where the ACG slides were fabricated on 2
consecutive hot days, where the reaction temperature was probably
not well maintained at 4 °C. The in-line voltage control (by
generator) was recorded, and thus the electrical current was measured
during the fabrication of ACG slide. The thickness of the AAO layer
was analyzed using ellipsometry. As can be seen in Figure 5, the electrical current is
linearly proportional to the thickness of the AAO layer of the substrate.
Alternatively, instead of using ellipsometry, the AAO thickness can
be estimated from the in-line electrical current measurement during
the ACG slide fabrication.

Figure 5 Thickness of the AAO layer vs electrical current
measured during
AAO fabrication. Repeated surface anodization experiments (30 times)
using one of the optimized reaction conditions (25.8 volts and 121
s) with the acid solutions either freshly prepared or reused up to
the sixth repeated use of the oxalic acid solution. The thickness
of the AAO layer was measured using ellipsometry. Spots within the
red square are the slides with optimized AAO thickness.

In summary, the thickness of the AAO layer grown
from this system
ranged from 23.1 to 185.7 nm (at 15 volts/90 s and 50 volts/120 s,
respectively, as shown in the Supporting Information). There were no pores created during surface anodization for the
formation of Al-oxide. Because the thickness of the coated aluminum
layer was only 300 nm, in 15 min of reaction time, all Al-oxide/aluminum
layers were dissolved and only the clear transparent glass slide remained.
Surface roughness of the AAO layer fabricated within the experimental
conditions ranged from 2.85 to 9.07 nm, as indicated in Figure S1A,C(b), all within the “capable
region” (<18 nm) for glycan microarrays. At constant low
reaction temperature (4 °C), the reaction time had a minor effect
on the thickness growth of the AAO layer, as indicated by the response
measurement shown in Figure 4C. However, an optimized surface of the ACG slide (with rms
at around 2 nm) was fabricated under the combined conditions of voltage
and reaction time at 4 °C. Therefore, we proposed the AAO growth
on the Al-coated glass slide into two regions: (1) the “major
AAO growth” (fast thickness increasing) region and (2) the
“electropolishing (surface smoothing) growth” region,
as presented in Figure 6A).

Figure 6B shows
the comparison of fluorescence intensity of mannose/ConA-A488 binding
on ACG slides no. 5 from the RSM (response surface measurement) experiments
vs the conventional NHS-activated glass slide. The ACG slide gave
higher fluorescence intensity than the NHS glass slide resulting from
the fluorescence tagged ConA binding to mannose on the surface. The
differences in these two types of slides (ACG slide vs NHS glass slide)
have been investigated further.

Figure 6 (A) On-time measurement of the AAO layer
formation under various
voltages and reaction times. The starting pure Al-coated glass slide
was as smooth as glass. The AAO growth (thickness increasing) depends
on the voltage at the beginning, and electropolishing (surface smoothing)
and extended AAO growth occur later. (B) Fluorescence intensity differences
in ACG slide no.5 of RSM (response surface measurement) study vs NHS
glass slide at various sugar solution concentrations arrayed on the

Figure 7 Particle counts and particle height of mannose
derivatives covalently
bound to ACG slide (A) and NHS slide surfaces (B) (analyzed using
AFM) suggested more uniformly distributed sugar molecules on the AAO
surface than that on the NHS glass slide.

As shown in Figure 7, the particle counts and particle height of mannose derivatives
on the ACG slide (rms 4.00 nm) and on the NHS glass slide (rms 1.02
nm) were analyzed using AFM scanned over the matrix of 10 × 10
μm2 area. Particle counts were obtained by counting
the number of particles above the height of one half width of the
particle height distribution. Mannose derivatives can be covalently
bound to the surface only where the activated (either Al-oxide or
NHS) functional groups are available. The ACG slide provides a surface
of more uniformly distributed reactive sites for covalent reaction
than that of the NHS glass slide. Particle height changes on the slide
surfaces are summarized and given in Table S6. Higher rms indicated higher surface roughness of the ACG slide
than that of the NHS-activated slide. The mean height varied before
and after sugar grafting and protein binding is an indication of conformational
change. Along this concept, as mannose was covalently bound on the
slide surface, the mean, minimum, and maximum particle height on the
ACG slide were higher than those on the NHS slide, suggesting that
the mannose derivative existed in a more extended structural conformation
perpendicular to the slide surfaces, as shown in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Conformation of Mannose
on ACG Slide vs NHS-Activated Glass Slide
Figure 8A,B shows
the GenePix scanning images (at PMT 380) of ConA-A488 bound to mannose
(1 mM) arrayed on the ACG slide versus the NHS-activated glass slide.
As can be seen, the Al-oxide surface has a higher sugar loading capacity
such that the array spots are reaching saturation even at the very
low value of photomultiplier tubes (PMT) of 380. The fluorescence
intensities of the averaged 20 spots for the ACG slide and NHS slide
are given in Figure 8C. The GenePix scanner has a resolution up to 5 μm (25 μm2 per 1 pixel), and the dimension of the arrayed spots ranges
from 60 to 250 μm in diameter with corresponding 110–1960
pixels, respectively. This has made it possible for us to access the
uniformity/distribution of covalently bound sugars within an array
spot. Figure 8D shows
the analysis of spot 1–5 (the first row and the fifth spot
counting from the right) of ACG versus NHS slides as shown in Figure 8A,B. The result from
the GenePix scanner recorded the spot dimension (Dia.), average fluorescence
intensity per pixel (F488 Mean) with standard deviation (F488 SD),
total fluorescence intensity of the spot (F488 total intensity), percentage
saturation (F488% sat.), and coefficient of variation within the spot
(F488 CV) are tabulated in Figure 8D. Even though the individual pixel intensity cannot
be resolved visually with the naked eye, the coefficient of variation
of pixel intensities (F488 CV) of 17 versus 65 indicates that the
ConA-A488/mannose distribution within a specific array spot on the
ACG slide is more uniform than that on the NHS glass slide.

binding on ACG slide (left) vs NHS-activated glass slide (right).

The GenePix scanner has a maximum
resolution of 5 μm, whereas
confocal microscopes have better resolution up to several hundred
nanometers (1/2λ). Figure 8E shows the confocal microscope images of ConA-A488/mannose
binding (Lica SP8) on ACG slide versus NHS-activated glass slides
of approximately 30 × 30 μm2 within the spots
(using Leica SP8). Consistent with the results obtained from GenePix
fluorescence intensity and AFM scanning, the amorphous Al-oxide on
the ACG slide provides not only higher sugar loading capacity but
also more uniformly distributed glycan molecules on the surface. The
ACG slide should serve as a better surface for glycan array to facilitate
our understanding of glycan–protein interaction.

Conclusions
A smooth surface anodization of aluminum-coated glass slide has
been developed to fabricate the AAO layer with thickness optimized
to 50–65 nm from the 300 nm aluminum-coated glass slide for
the glycan microarray. The fabrication of AAO layer has been considered
in two regions: (1) the “major fast AAO growth” region
and (2) the “electropolishing growth” region. At constant
temperature, the combined effects on voltage and reaction time are
related to the thickness of AAO growth. Using the Con A/mannose binding
system, the sugar loading capacity and uniformity/distribution of
the reactive site for sugar attachment to the ACG slide have been
compared with those of the NHS-activated glass slide. The ACG slide
has a surface that is more stable, higher loading capacity, and more
uniformly distributed reactive site for sugar arraying through covalent
phosphonate formation. This array system is more convenient to prepare
and should be useful for the study of multivalent interaction and
heteroligand binding in addition to the traditional use in the study
of protein–sugar interaction.

Experimental Section
Fabrication
of the Aluminum-Coated Glass Slide
The
aluminum (99.999% purity)-coated glass slides were fabricated by the
Vacuum and Thin Film Technology Division, Instrument Technology Research
Center at the National Applied Research Laboratories, Hsinchu Science
Park, Hsinchu, Taiwan. The VDP equipment of the ion beam-assisted
(Veeco 16 cm RF ion source) E/B gun coater was assembled by the domestic
F.S.E. Corporation. The glass slides were purchased either from Schott
Nexterion (Glass B cleanroom cleaned) or from Arrayit Corporation
(SuperClean 2 Microarray Substrate SMC2) with nominal dimensions of
75.6 × 25 × 1 mm3. The thickness of the coated
aluminum layer was fixed at 100 and 300 nm. After being coated with
pure aluminum, the slides were packed immediately (one slide per container
under the nitrogen atmosphere), vacuum-sealed with an air-tight laminated
foil, free from exposure to oxygen to prevent the formation of NAO,
and kept sealed until the electrochemical reaction for surface anodization.
The thickness, surface roughness, and particle counts of the AAO layer
were analyzed using nondestructive ellipsometry (SOPRA ES4G) and AFM
(Veeco di Dimension 3100 SPM), and the surface morphology and cross
section view were examined using SEM (FE-4300).

Surface Anodization
of the Aluminum-Coated Glass Slide
The electrochemical reaction
was conducted in 0.3 M oxalic acid aqueous
solution in a 4 °C temperature-controlled incubator. Inside of
the incubator, a thermocouple was dipped into the water-bath acid
solution to ascertain the reaction temperature. A plastic plate was
fabricated in-house to hold the platinum electrode and a fixture of
the positive electrode such that the aluminum-coated glass slide could
be clamped or removed easily from the power supply (Keithley 2400).
Surface anodization was controlled by voltage and reaction time varying
from 9 to 54 volts and from 48 to 200 s, respectively, depending on
the designed experiment (using Design Expert 8.0). After surface anodization,
the slide was washed thoroughly with deionized water, purge dried
with nitrogen gas, and then annealed in a 100 °C oven for 10
min. After being cooled to room temperature, this ACG slide was stored
overnight in a 30% relative humidity chamber at room temperature,
ready for the following experiments.(a) AAO coating thickness analyzed using
ellipsometry (SOPRA ES4G).

(b) AAO surface roughness analyzed using
AFM, Veeco di Dimension 3100 SPM.

(c) Microarray (BioDot AD3200G) and covalent
formation of mannose-α-5-pentylphosphonic acid with Al-oxide
on the slide surface. The mannose derivative was dissolved in a 30:70
ratio of water/ethylene glycol mixture with solution concentration
(depending on the experiments) varying from 100 mM to 1 pM (i.e.,
12 samples with consecutive serial dilutions), microarrayed, and kept
in a 80% humidity chamber for 2 h, then stored in a 30% HR chamber,
ready for protein binding analysis the next day.

(d) Binding of ConA-A488 to mannose. ACG
slides were loaded on the FAST frame (maximum of four slides per frame)
with each slide divided into 16 wells. The mannose derivative was
arrayed in 10 × 10 or 10 × 12 matrices per well (depending
on the experiments). The ConA-A488 (100 μL, 33 μg/mL)
buffer solution was filled into each well for sugar/protein binding,
which took about 30 min to 1 h at room temperature. Following the
incubation for sugar/protein binding, standard washing (three times
bovine serum albumin/phosphate binding buffer, three times phosphate-buffered
saline/Tween buffer, and three times D.I. water) was conducted to
remove the noncovalently bound sugar, mobile sugar bound protein,
and any excess protein. The slide was dried carefully and subjected
to a fluorescence intensity reading using a GenePix 4300A microarray
scanner.

(e) Computer analysis
to obtain the optimized
AAO fabrication condition. The reaction variables and response measurements
were analyzed (using Design Expert 8.0). Data analysis has revealed
the surface of AAO fabrication conditions with respect to the fluorescence
intensity of sugar/protein binding on the surface.



Characterization of Sugar Loading Capacity, Uniformity, and
Structural Conformation of Sugar Derivatives Covalently Bound to the
Slide Surfaces
(1) Slide surfaces with covalently bound sugars
were examined under AFM. The outcome essentially gave information
on the sugar loading capacity and the uniformity of sugars on the
ACG slide compared with that on the NHS glass slide. (2) The conformational
differences in the sugar derivatives covalently bound to the slide
surface were also examined via the particle height analysis using
AFM. (3) The microarray sugar/protein binding data of individual spots
were examined using a GenePix scanner; within an arrayed spot, the “average
pixel intensity” and its coefficient of variation (% CV) were
reported. (4) The same sugar/protein binding slides were also examined
under a confocal microscope.
