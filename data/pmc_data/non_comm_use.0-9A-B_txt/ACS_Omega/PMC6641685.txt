Thiazole
orange (TO) exists mainly as a monomer in aqueous medium,
where its fluorescence is negligibly small due to intramolecular movements.
In the present study, it has been shown that in presence of giant
unilamellar vesicles, produced from anionic lipid molecules, TO prefers
to form H-dimer and H-aggregates at low lipid concentrations. The
nonfluorescent form of TO (monomer) starts fluorescing in the aggregated
or dimeric forms. At higher 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol)
concentration, the TO aggregates disintegrate to the monomeric variants.
This is principally due to generation of more surface of residence
for the TO molecules. The dye molecules/aggregates reside on the outer
surface as well as percolate inside the lipid vesicles toward the
inner water pool due to the presence of anionic charges at the interface.
We adopted fluorescence lifetime imaging to find out the heterogeneity
in photophysics of the different forms of TO inside the lipid vesicles
supported by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to characterize
the formation or disintegration of the TO aggregates.

Introduction
Photophysical studies on molecular aggregation
have been extensively
investigated by many research groups since it was first reported by Jelley.1 It is known that
many chromophores exist as dimer and higher aggregates along with
the monomeric form in solution at higher concentration or in viscous
medium. This restricts free movement of the dye with far-reaching
consequences. Self-aggregation of dyes has found numerous applications
in photography,2 solar cells,3,4 nonlinear optical devices,5 semiconductors,6 and organic photovoltaic cells.7 Among the various natures of aggregation, two are most
important: J- and H-aggregates.8−11 These two types of aggregates can be distinguished
by their characteristic absorption spectra. H-aggregates are formed
by head-to-head stacking of dye molecules and exhibit absorption at
a lower wavelength. On the other hand, J-aggregates are comprised
of edge-to-edge alignment with a bathochromic shift in the absorption
spectrum with respect to the monomer. Characteristically, J-aggregates
exhibit strong fluorescence often surpassing that of the monomeric
dyes,8−11 which is not observed in thiazole orange (TO). The type and probability
of aggregation is controlled by factors such as the structure of dye
molecules,12 nature of the solvent,13 temperature, and environment.14,15 On the basis of this concept, several investigations have been made
to modify the dye aggregation in micelles,16 DNA,17 lipid bilayer,18 polymers,19,20 and so on.

Cyanine dyes
and their derivatives have been the foremost to show
propensity to form aggregates in aqueous solution21−23 and in other
media, such as, surfactants,24 cyclodextrins,25 etc. That the cyanine dyes can be forced to
aggregate by changing the ionic strength of the medium to form higher
order aggregates was reported by Mooi et al.26 The asymmetric cyanine dye, TO, is under attention of many workers
due to its special properties. TO has very low quantum yield in water
(0.0002) due to efficient nonradiative photoisomerization and free
rotation of the benzothiazole and quinoline heterocycles.27−29 Interestingly, the fluorescence from TO increases appreciably on
binding to nucleic acids,27,30−33 macrocycles,28,34 micelles,35 etc. and thus acts as an excellent sensor for designing
molecular logic gates36 and DNA G-quadruplexes.37 Free rotation of the chromophore units in TO
around the connecting single bond ceases under restricted conditions,
leading to an enormous increase in fluorescence yield.35

Herein, we report the distribution and
hence modification of the
TO aggregates in different forms in negatively charged giant unilamellar
vesicles (GUVs) of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol)
(DMPG) lipids. The giant lipid vesicles are convenient systems to
study the biological pathways in membranes and widely used for experiments
under microscopes, as they are large enough to see (>1 μm).38−40 We have demonstrated the formation of H-aggregates and dimers of
TO up to a certain concentration of DMPG, followed by breaking into
monomers at higher concentrations of lipid. The dynamics of aggregation
were studied using steady-state spectroscopy with support from fluorescence
lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). We selected different positions
of a single GUV using a confocal microscope to collect FLIM data that
suggests superficial cleaving of TO aggregates to monomer in presence
of higher number of GUVs in solution. The increase in diffusion time
at low lipid concentrations, as studied by fluorescence correlation
spectroscopy (FCS), clearly supports the above-mentioned phenomenon.
To our knowledge, this is the first report for the study of the aggregation
pattern of TO in giant lipid vesicles using a confocal microscope
for detailed visual description of the dynamics.

Results and Discussion
Photophysics
of TO in DMPG GUV
The absorption spectrum
(Figure 1A) of TO (∼3.8
μM) in water shows a maximum at 500 nm, corresponding to the
monomer, and a shoulder at ∼476 nm and peak at ∼420
nm appear due to the H-dimers and higher H-aggregates, respectively.27,28 The absorbance for H-aggregates (420 nm) increases at the expense
of the monomer and dimer on addition of DMPG for up to 10 μM.
Introduction of more GUVs (above 10 μM DMPG) leads to increase
in the dimer and monomer absorptions and decrease in higher H-aggregates
(420 nm). Hence, the results show that up to a certain concentration
of GUVs (below 10 μM DMPG), TO prefers to form the higher H-aggregates.
However, on addition of more GUVs in solution, the probability of
formation of monomer and dimer increases. Figure 1B provides the emission spectra of TO with
increase in DMPG concentration exciting the sample at 465 nm. TO is
negligibly fluorescent in aqueous medium due to free rotation of the
benzothiazole and quinoline groups, as mentioned earlier. A gradual
enhancement in fluorescence yield occurs as the lipid concentration
increases up to 40 μM, with maximum at 640 nm, followed by quenching
with a concomitant blue shift of ∼6 nm.

Figure 1 (A) Absorption, (B) representative
emission spectra, and (C) relative
change in peak intensity at 635 nm of TO (∼3.8 μM), with
increase in concentration of DMPG. The solid and dashed arrows designating
the change in DMPG concentration correspond to the solid and dashed
spectral fits, respectively (λex = 465 nm). The direction
of the arrows (dashed or solid) indicates increase or decrease of
the fluorescence intensity. The horizontal solid arrow in B indicates
blue shift of the spectrum.

Because the peak at 640 nm is assigned to the TO dimers and
H-aggregates,
the band at 530 nm is due to the TO monomer that fluoresces weakly
in water at this wavelength.35 The fluorescence
intensity increases at 635 nm with addition of the GUVs up to a certain
concentration (∼40 μM DMPG). This indicates increase
in TO H-aggregates (up to 0–10 μM DMPG) followed by the
TO dimers (10–40 μM DMPG) on the vesicle surface. Disintegration
into TO monomers initiates on addition of the GUVs having DMPG concentration
above 40 μM. The above observations are confirmed by Figure 2C that presents a
broad understanding on the behavior of the TO molecules at different
ranges of the DMPG concentrations. The plot of the relative intensities
at 635 nm shows breaks at ∼10 and ∼40 μM DMPG
concentration. The H-aggregates of TO rapidly break to dimers above
10 μM DMPG, followed by further breaking above ∼40 μM
DMPG to TO monomers having small fluorescence.

of TO at different concentrations of DMPG
excited at 490 nm. The arrows indicate change in concentration (in
micromolar) of lipid; (B) viscosity-dependent absorption and emission
spectra (λex = 465 nm) of TO in glycerol–water
mixture.

The excitation of TO at 490 nm
(maximum absorption by the monomer)
in aqueous medium shows initial existence of the monomeric form. On
addition of the GUVs, TO prefers to adopt H-aggregation up to a certain
concentration until when the monomer does not show much increase.
Beyond 30–40 μM DMPG, TO monomers start to build up comparatively
faster than the other aggregates (Figure 2A). The absorption and emission spectra of
TO in glycerol–water mixtures confirm that the band at 530
nm is indeed for the TO monomer (Figure 2B). Higher viscosity of the medium hinders
free rotation of the two chromophoric units thus suppressing the nonradiative
decay channels.

Generally, H-aggregates and H-dimers show lower
emission compared
to that of the monomer.45,46 For TO, it has been
observed that the reverse is true. In line with Choudhury et al.,35 the exciton
theory of Kasha implies that for H-aggregates the excited state splits
into a higher and lower energy exciton state.47 However, transition to only the higher energy exciton state is allowed
and that is why the band in the blue region of the absorption spectrum
arises. This excited state rapidly undergoes interconversion to the
lower energy exciton state thus lowering the transition probability
from this state to the ground state, resulting into quenching of fluorescence.
The fluorescent H-aggregates may arise due to higher rigidity of the
aggregates compared to that of the monomer or slight rotation of the
two π–π stacked sandwiched aggregates of the dye
that lowers the transition forbiddance of the lower exciton state.48

In our results, the emission due to the
TO H-dimers and H-aggregates
is quite high compared to that of the monomer. This is due to the
rigidity of the two rotating chromophoric units after aggregation.
The average binding constant (K) of the dye with
DMPG vesicles was determined from the steady-state spectra using the
modified Benesi–Hildebrand plot, as shown in Figure 3A, following the equation 1  where ΔF = F – F0 and
ΔFmax = Fα – F0. F0, F, and Fα indicate the fluorescence
intensities of the dye in absence, at an intermediate concentration,
and at complete interaction with DMPG, respectively. K is the binding constant that is calculated from the slope of the
1/ΔF versus 1/[L] plot as
3.8 × 105 M–1. As reflected by the
absorption spectra (Figure 1A), multiple equilibria are present in the dye–lipid
vesicle interaction. Hence, the lower lipid concentrations were considered
in the plot. Varying temperature to encompass the gel–fluid
transition condition of the lipid vesicles showed that the change-over
from TO H-aggregate to H-dimer followed by monomer occurs at around
30 μM DMPG concentration, at 28 and 45 °C and at 40 μM
at 15 °C (Figure 3B). This indicates that the aggregation of TO molecules in presence
of DMPG GUVs is somewhat dependent on the gel–fluid transition
of the lipid vesicles.

FLIM and FCS Results on TO Aggregation in Lipid Vesicles
In a previous report on aggregation of TO in sodium dodecyl sulfate/water
and aerosol-OT (AOT)/heptanes systems, Choudhury et al. suggested
that TO initially exists as a monomer in aqueous solution.35 However, we found that all forms of TO (monomer,
dimer, and H-aggregate) exist in water. TO forms H-aggregate/dimer
at low surfactant concentrations as there are premicellar aggregates.35 In contrast, at lower concentrations of DMPG
(0–10 μM), we found mainly H-aggregates of TO. Disaggregation
of the dye occurs beyond the critical micellar concentration.35 Similar to this was the observation with the
GUVs, where the H-dimers of TO developed up to a certain lipid concentration
followed by dominance of monomers. Intermediate disaggregation of
the dye was obtained in the AOT/heptane system with enhanced AOT concentration
forming H-dimers due to the electrostatic interactions between the
dye and the AOT head groups.35 The increase
in water content in the AOT reverse micelles favored disintegration
of the H-dimers to the monomer form. This effect was stated to be
due to hydration of the dye molecules at the aqueous interface.35 The lipid vesicles have two aqueous interfaces
separated by a hydrophobic kernel. Hence, following the above reasoning,
TO should be distributed in the lipid vesicle and the photophysics,
thus, will be heterogeneous.

To explore the heterogeneity in
properties, we performed FLIM on TO in a single GUV excited at 488
nm and monitored at two emission wavelengths, 550 and 650 nm. Two
TO-containing stock solutions with vesicles constituted by 10 and
60 μM lipid concentrations were used. The size of the GUVs was
in the range of 40–50 μm and the size of the water pool
had a diameter of ∼30 μm. A drop of the sample solution
was spread and dried on the cover slip. A GUV was identified through
the microscope for the FLIM experiment. Figure 5 shows the images of the GUV recovered from
the 10 μM stock to represent the distribution of TO. The lifetime
data was calculated from the marked positions in the vesicle in Figure 5 and shown in Tables 1 and 2. The color code shows that TO has a greater fluorescence
lifetime toward the water pool. Three decay components were mostly
found for each position, represented by τ1, τ2, and τ3. Hence, it is apparent that all
three types of species (monomer, H-dimer, and H-aggregate) exist under
all circumstances inside the lipid vesicles. However, their decay
times vary due to heterogeneity in surroundings. Noticeably, the lifetime
of the monomer is much slower than that reported, as it is entrapped
into the lipid vesicle.35 The fastest component
with higher contribution at 550 nm is assigned to the monomer as the
contribution increases at higher DMPG concentration. The longer lifetime
components are due to the H-dimer and H-aggregate. The TO monomer
fluoresces at 530 nm and is the major contributor while monitoring
at 550 nm. As discussed above, on addition of the GUVs in higher concentration,
the proportion of the TO monomers increases. This is also reflected
in the time-resolved data at 60 μM DMPG concentration. We have
picked the decay times at three regions (a–c) as marked in Figure 4. The monomer contribution
reduces on penetration into the lipid vesicles.

The H-dimer and H-aggregates
fluoresce at 650 nm, and hence monitoring
at this wavelength yields major contributions from the aggregated
forms of TO that considerably decrease on addition of higher concentration
of the GUVs. Moreover, we could hardly observe any contribution from
the monomers in the inner aqueous core probably due to very low quantum
yield of the TO monomeric forms. The observations show that the species
present on the surface of the GUVs are most affected due to increase
in concentration of the lipid vesicles. A schematic representation
is shown in Figure 5 to visualize the effect of increased concentration
of GUVs on TO.

Figure 5 Schematic representation showing that TO resides as a
dimer/aggregate
at lower DMPG concentration, whereas at higher lipid concentration
the monomers dominate.

Because it is shown that the TO molecules distribute themselves
in different forms on the surfaces of the GUVs heterogeneously, we
checked the diffusion of the lipid-bound TO molecules (∼2 nM)
at various concentrations of DMPG (Figure 6). The excitation beam (488 nm) was focused
above the surface of the cover slip containing the experimental solution
to capture free diffusion. All FCS data were taken from samples in
solution and not from stationary lipid vesicles used for FLIM. The
measured diffusion times (τD) indicate the translational
motion of TO adsorbed on the GUVs. Because TO is practically nonfluorescent
in aqueous medium due to mutual rotation of two chromophore units,
FCS data due to diffusion of free TO could not be recorded. However,
the fluorescence yield increases considerably on attachment of TO
to the lipid vesicles due to the imposition of a restricted environment
and hence FCS data could be obtained. The concentration of the DMPG
was maintained in the nanomolar range to correlate the dye–GUV
concentration ratio as used in the steady-state experiments.

Figure 6 Raw data and
fits to the FCS data obtained for TO (∼2 nM)
at various concentrations of DMPG.

The virtually single molecule resolution of the FCS technique
helped
to disclose the real heterogeneity of the different TO species at
various concentrations of DMPG and hence of GUVs’. At very
low lipid concentration (1 nM), fit to the raw data yielded a single
diffusion time (3.30 ms) presumably corresponding to lower aggregates
of TO. This was not clear from the steady-state measurements. On adding
more lipids (5 nM) and hence enhancing the GUV population in solution,
we obtained a two-component fit corresponding to two different species,
one of which was diffusing considerably slowly (∼47 ms). This
species could be the higher H-aggregates of TO that coexist with the
lower aggregates of TO. The increase in GUV population (25 nM) in
solution leads to cleavage of the higher aggregates, and hence the
TO on the lipid vesicles diffuse faster (∼27 ms). More increase
in lipid concentration leads to further breakdown of the aggregates,
leading to formation of TO dimers that diffuse with the vesicle rafts
in 1.13 ms. Much higher concentration of DMPG (100 nM) and hence of
GUVs provide TO monomers on the GUV surface that diffuse the fastest
(0.27 ms).

Conclusions
In this work, we have
shown that the DNA-binding dye, TO, exists
mainly as monomer in aqueous medium, where its fluorescence is negligibly
small due to intramolecular rotation and nonradiative decay. It forms
H-dimer and H-aggregates in stages on interaction with DMPG GUVs.
Because TO is a cationic dye molecule, the anionic lipid DMPG has
been chosen to generate GUVs. The photophysics of TO changes considerably
on aggregation and starts fluorescing due to reduction of the nonradiative
decay processes. It was shown before that TO prefers aggregation on
the micellar surface at low micelle concentrations in solution but
disintegrates to monomers with increase in micelle concentration.
We found through our experiments that this is true with the GUVs also
and quantified the process of formation of H-aggregates, followed
by disintegration to monomers. Because lipid vesicles have an inner
water pool, it is expected that TO should move toward the interior
of the lipid vesicles. Interestingly, we found that the TOs spread
on both the aqueous interfaces of the GUVs and also exist in the hydrophobic
kernel. We adopted FLIM to find out the heterogeneity in photophysics
of the different forms of TO inside the lipid vesicles. The data are
supported by FCS studied at single molecule resolution, where we found
variations in diffusion of the dye molecules in different forms depending
on the concentration of the GUVs.

Experimental Section
Materials
The dye TO and lipid DMPG (Figure 7A,B) were purchased from Sigma
and were used as obtained. The stock solution of the dye was prepared
in methanol, and its concentration was calculated from the molar extinction
coefficient (ε = 63 000 M–1 cm–1 at 500 nm).27 The GUVs
were prepared following a previously reported protocol.41 Briefly, a weighed amount of DMPG was dissolved
in chloroform to obtain a 0.1 M solution and 20 μL of it was
added to a mixture of 980 μL of chloroform and 100–200
μL of methanol. The aqueous phase (5 mL of Tris buffer) was
then carefully added along the wall of the flask. The organic solvent
was removed by a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure (final pressure 60 mm Hg) at 40 °C
and 40 rpm. Because of different boiling points of chloroform (61
°C) and methanol (64 °C), we observed two major boiling
events. After evaporation for about 2 min, an opalescent solution
was obtained containing a high concentration of GUV. The vesicles
obtained by this procedure were exclusively GUVs, as observed under
the microscope, and the size was in the range of 40–50 μm.

Figure 7 (A) Thiazole
orange (TO), (B) 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol)
sodium salt (DMPG).

The microscope cover
glasses and slides (Blue Star, India) were
cleaned thoroughly by sequential washing in an ultrasonic bath with
water, alcohol, acid, and alkali and dried properly. A 50 μL
sample solution was placed on the slide, dried and covered by a cover
glass, and used for the FLIM studies. The lipid vesicles were adsorbed
on the surface of the cover slide, as confirmed by the repeated surface
scan. For FCS, a 20 μL droplet of the 2 nM sample solution was
put over a 0.1 mm cover glass and focused under an inverted microscope.
All experiments were performed at 25 °C.

Methods
The absorption
spectra were recorded in a UV–vis
spectrophotometer (U-2900) from Hitachi, and all emission spectra
were recorded on a QM-40 spectrofluorimeter from PTI. A temperature
controller water bath from Julabo was attached to the fluorimeter
for the temperature-dependent experiments.

For the FLIM studies,
a confocal laser scanning inverted microscope (Axio Observer A1) from
Zeiss was coupled with a DCS-120 system from Becker & Hickl GmbH
(BH). A picosecond diode laser (λex = 488 nm, BDL-488-SMC;
BH), was used as the excitation source. The scanning was controlled
by a BH GVD-120 scan controller. The BH HPM-100-40 hybrid detector
module in DCS-120 system was controlled by the DCC-100 software. A
long pass filter (HQ495LP) was placed to block the excitation light,
and two narrow band pass filters of 550 and 650 nm (full width at
half-maximum = 10 nm, FKB-Vis-10; Thorlabs, Inc.) were used to monitor
the emission wavelengths. The time-correlated single photon counting
(TCSPC) FLIM system was controlled by the “SPCM” TCSPC
operating software and by the software of the DCC-100 detector controller.
Different operation modes for recording the single decay curve or
fluorescence correlation (FCS) curves were selected as required. The
emission light from a selected point of the sample was collected by
the microscope lens, descanned by the galvanometer mirrors, separated
from the excitation beam, split into two channels of different wavelengths,
and focused into pinholes in a plane conjugate with the focal plane
in the sample. The out-of-focus light is thus suppressed. The FLIM
images were analyzed in SPCImage software for decay measurement at
a particular point of the sample.

For the FCS measurements,
a confocal setup in the DCS-120 system
coupled with an inverted optical microscope (Axio Observer A1) from
Zeiss was used. The excitation light from picosecond pulsed laser
diodes of wavelength 488 nm (BDL-488-SMC; BH) was focused through
a water immersion objective (40×, 1.2 NA) into the sample solution
placed on a cover slip. The measurement time is 30 s per sample. The
signal was processed by DCC-100 single photon counting card, and the
autocorrelation function G(τ) was generated.
The correlation function G(τ) of the fluorescence
intensities is given by eq 2(42) 2  where δF(t + τ) is the fluctuation in intensity at a delay τ around
the mean value, that is, δF(t) = F(t) – ⟨F(t)⟩, and ⟨F⟩ is the average intensity.

A system containing M diffusing species with comparable
triplet decay times and Yi (∑Yi = 1) being their fractions, the general autocorrelation
function is given by eq 3(43) 3  where T is the fraction of
molecules in the triplet state with relaxation time τtr, τi denotes the diffusion time
of a dye molecule in the confocal volume, t is the
delay time, N is the average number of molecules
in the excitation volume, and r/z is the structure parameter (r and z being the radius of the volume element in xy and z direction). The dimension of the volume element was determined
by using Rh6G of the known diffusion coefficient (Dt = 426 μm2 s–1).44 The estimated radius in xy direction
was 0.34 μm, with an effective volume of 3.3 fL. The diffusion
constant was calculated from the following eq 4 4  where τD is the diffusion
time in the focal volume. All FCS measurements were performed at room
temperature.
