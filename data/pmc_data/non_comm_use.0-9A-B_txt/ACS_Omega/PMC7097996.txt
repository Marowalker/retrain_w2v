The
effects of ozone concentration, NaOH concentration, type and
concentration of additives, initial pH, temperature, and NO and SO2 concentration on simultaneous removal of NO and SO2 were studied through ozone oxidation combined with wet absorption.
Results indicated that ozone concentration and the type and concentration
of additives had the most significant effect on NO removal. The optimal
ozone concentration was 250 ppm (NO/NO2 = 1), and the best
additive was KMnO4. The removal efficiency of NOx was as high as 97.86% when NO/NO2 = 1,
and the concentration of KMnO4 was 0.025 mol/L. Considering
economic and other factors, the KMnO4 concentration was
selected to be 0.006 mol/L. At this time, the removal efficiencies
of NOx and SO2 were 81.35 and
100%, respectively. This method has potential application prospects
for simultaneous removal of SO2 and NO in the industrial
flue gas.

==== Body
1 Introduction
In China, the main contributor
to severe smog pollution is the
generation of various air pollutants such as particulate matter (PM),
sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) during coal combustion, especially for power generation
and supply.1,2 Even though coal is the main source of greenhouse
gases, it is undeniable that coal will become a major energy source
in the near future because of its supply and cost efficiency stability.3 Currently, 33–77% of PM2.5 in
China can be attributed to secondary aerosols emitted by SO2 and NOx.4 At the same time, the use of biomass boilers is increasing rapidly
with the replacement of coal, which also leads to more and more emissions
of flue gas pollutants. Because of the variety and scale of biomass
boilers, equipment operating conditions and the level of pollution
control technologies vary widely, and the control of NO and SO2 emissions from biomass boilers has always been the focus
of attention.

At present, various techniques such as adsorption,
catalytic reduction,
nonthermal plasma, and electron beam have been developed to remove
SO2 and NOx.5−8 Among the existing technologies
for removing NOx, the selective catalytic
reduction (SCR) technology has always been considered the most effective
technology. However, it has disadvantages such as high investment
operation cost, large equipment area, large changes to the original
flue gas, strict temperature range requirements, ammonia escaping,
and catalyst poisoning, which restricts its application in tail gas
treatment. The difficulty in achieving wet scrubbing to get high efficiency
in removing NOx is largely due to the
low solubility of NO.9 The solubility of
NO in water is increased by the oxidation of NO to higher oxidation
states (NO3, NO2, and N2O5). In some studies, strong oxidants such as ozone (O3),
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), chlorine dioxide (ClO2), potassium permanganate (KMnO4), sodium chlorite
(NaClO2), sodium hypochlorite (NaClO), sodium persulfate
(Na2S2O8), Co(NH3)62+, and Fe(II)EDTA were added to the absorption
liquid to oxidize NO.10−18 Shao et al. proposed a method using KI as an additive to remove
NOx and SO2 simultaneously.19 Adewuyi et al. utilized persulfate activated
by Fe2+ and heat to achieve the purpose of simultaneous
removal of NO and SO2.20 Hao
et al. studied the use of vaporized H2O2 as
an oxidant and Na2SO3 as an absorbent to absorb
NO2 and NO.21 Liu et al. used
H2O2/Fe2(MoO4)3 as the oxidant in the study process.22 In the absence of SO2 or the presence of SO2, it is a common method to use ozone to oxidize NO into a high-valence
mixture at the meteorological interface and then enter the wet scrubbing
system. However, in reality, the sulfur concentration in coal is different
from the subsequent SO2 flue gas concentration. Therefore,
some studies had already noted that it was necessary to investigate
the removal efficiency of NOx at different
SO2 concentrations. Fang et al. used a urea solution to
remove SO2 and NOx by wet scrubbing
and found that the SO2 removal rate was maintained at 100%
during the process of changing the concentrations of SO2 from 1000 to 3000 ppm.23 Si et al. studied
a method of simultaneously removing NOx and SO2 by using O3 as an oxidant and a limestone
slurry as an absorbent.24 As the SO2 concentrations increased from 2200 to 4500 mg/m3, the NOx removal efficiency increased
by more than 10%.

In this study, these latest studies were extended
by wet scrubbing
of NO after oxidation with ozone. Ozone was used as an oxidant at
the meteorological interface, and then the flue gas was mixed into
a wet scrubbing system by using NaOH as the absorbing liquid. The
purpose of this study was to explore different operating conditions
on simultaneous removal of SO2 and NO. Constructive guidance
can be provided for the practical application of O3 combined
with NaOH and KMnO4 to simultaneously remove NO and SO2 by determining the optimum reaction conditions.

2 Experimental
Setup
2.1 Materials
N2 (99.999%),
NO (10.02%), and SO2 (4.01%) of Zhuozheng Gas Co., Ltd.
from Guangzhou were used as standard gases during the experiment.
Sodium chlorite (>78.00%, AR), nitric acid (65–68.00%, AR),
sodium persulfate (≥98.00%, AR), sodium hydroxide (≥98.00%,
AR), and potassium permanganate (≥99.50%, AR) were all purchased
from Guangzhou chemical reagents and used without further purification.

2.2 Experimental System
Figure 1 shows the schematic diagram
of the experimental apparatus, and the entire experimental system
was roughly divided into four parts, namely, an experimental material
supply system, an ozone oxidation system, a flue gas processing unit,
and a sampling analysis system. NO, SO2, and N2 were obtained through steel cylinders, and their flow rate was controlled
by a matching computer, while O3 was produced by an ozone
generator (FG-Y). NO and SO2 were injected into the flue
gas treatment system after being diluted by N2 and reacted
with the ozone generated by the ozone generator. After the mixing
reaction, the gas entered the absorption tower through the pipeline,
and finally, the gas from the absorption tower entered the flue gas
analysis system, and the gas flow rate of 2 L/min was always maintained
during the reaction process.

Figure 2 Changes in NO and NO2 concentrations
under different
O3 concentrations. [NO] = 500 ppm and [SO2]
= 1000 ppm.

The absorption experiment was
carried out in a bubble column made
of borosilicate glass (25 cm in length and 10 cm in diameter). The
mixed gas continuously passed through the meteorological and liquid
phase systems during the reaction time. The flue gas analyzer (Testo350XL,
Germany Detu Instrument International Trading Co., Ltd.) has been
used to monitor the concentrations of O2, NO, NO2, and SO2 in different time periods during the experiment
in order to calculate the removal efficiencies of SO2 and
NO.

2.3 Data Analysis
The removal efficiencies
of NO, NOx, and NO2 can be
calculated by the following formula 1   2   3  where η is the removal
efficiency.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Influence of Ozone Concentration on the Meteorological
Interface
The experiment was carried out by changing the
O3 concentration from 110 to 460 ppm. Figure 2 shows the changes in NO and
NO2 concentrations at different ozone concentrations. The
concentration of NO2 gradually increased with the increase
of ozone concentration, while the concentration of NO gradually decreased.
The reaction between ozone and NO at the gas interface is as follows
(4–6),25,26 and the final production is closely related to the O3 concentration of the inlet. 4   5   6  

At the same time, it can be
seen that
the concentration of NO converted to NO2 was approximately
equal to the concentration of ozone injected, which indicated that
the reaction between O3 and NO was mainly reaction 4 when the ozone concentration
was lower than the NO concentration. NO and NO2 with a
concentration ratio of essentially 1:1 can be seen from Figure 2 when the injected ozone concentration
was slightly higher than 250 ppm. When the ozone concentration was
increased to 460 ppm, it was found that 91.11% of NO was oxidized
to NO2. The concentration of SO2 only slightly
changed with the increase of ozone concentration, which meant that
the reaction between O3 and SO2 was almost negligible
compared with the reaction of O3 with NO. Reaction 7 is more difficult than reaction 4 for the activation
energy of reaction 4 is
greater than the activation energy of reaction 7, which may be the reason why O3 preferentially reacts with NO. 7  

3.2 Influence of Wet Absorption
In the
experiment, 0.5 and 1 g of NaOH were added to 1 L of distilled water
as an absorbent (the molar concentrations were 0.0125 and 0.025 mol/L,
respectively). Figure 3a shows the NOx removal efficiencies
of different O3 concentrations. It can be seen that in
the absence of SO2, the removal efficiency of NOx appeared to increase first and then decrease with
the increase of O3 concentration. When the O3 concentration increased from 0 to 250 ppm, the NOx removal efficiency increased from 5.19 to 61.05%, and then
as the O3 concentration increased to 460 ppm, the NOx removal efficiency decreased to 52.17%.
When the SO2 concentration was 1000 ppm, the removal efficiency
of NOx gradually increased, but when the
O3 concentration exceeded 250 ppm, the increasing trend
was slow. At the same time, the presence of SO2 made the
removal efficiency of NOx slightly increased,
indicating that SO2 had promoted the removal of NOx. The removal efficiency of SO2 reached 100% during the whole reaction process. Therefore, we determined
that the optimal O3 concentration was 250 ppm (NO/NO2 = 1); so, the O3 concentration was taken as 250
ppm in subsequent experiments.

Figure 3 (a) NOx removal
efficiency of different
O3 concentrations. [NO] = 500 ppm and [NaOH] = 0.0125 mol/L.
(b) NO, NO2, and NOx removal
efficiencies of different NaOH concentrations. [NO] = 500 ppm, [SO2] = 1000 ppm, and [O3] = 250 ppm.

Figure 4 (a) NO removal efficiency under different oxidants; (b) NO2 removal efficiency under different oxidants; (c) NOx removal efficiency under different oxidants; and
(d) average removal efficiency of NO, NO2, and NOx under different oxidants. [NO] = 500 ppm, [SO2] = 1000 ppm, [O3] = 250 ppm, and [NaOH] = 0.025
mol/L.

Figure 3b shows
that with the increase of NaOH concentration, the average removal
rate of NO decreased from 82.62 to 77.79%, but the average removal
rate of NO2 increased from 68.42 to 83.35%. From the removal
rate of NOx, increasing the mass of NaOH
will increase the average removal rate of NOx from 64.60 to 68.42%, indicating that increasing the quality
of NaOH was beneficial to the removal of NOx. The increase in NOx removal rate
is mainly due to the persistence of SO2 during reactions 8 and 9, and it has been reported that Na2SO3 can act as an absorbent for NO2.27−29 8   9  

The decrease in NO
removal rate may be due to the involvement of
NO2 in the removal process of NO (10–13),30 and
the lower concentration of NO2 directly led to a lower
NO removal rate after NO2 preferentially reacted with Na2SO3. The degree of reduction in NO absorption was
less than the extent of absorption of NO2, resulting in
an increase in the final NOx removal rate.
To avoid repeated NaOH additions, the amount of NaOH added in the
subsequent experiments was set to 1 g. The removal rate of SO2 during the whole reaction process was basically 100%, which
was consistent with many previous reports.28,31−33 The concentration of the inlet SO2 was
maintained at 1000 ppm during the subsequent experiments, and the
removal rate of the SO2 was found to be essentially 100%,
so that the description will not be repeated later. 10   11   12   13  

3.3 Effect
of Oxidant Type
Different
types of oxidants are typically added to the scrubbing system to achieve
the purpose of promoting the NO removal efficiency. In this study,
three relatively common oxidants, Na2S2O8, NaClO2, and KMnO4, were used. Na2S2O8, NaClO2, and KMnO4 (1 g) were separately added (the molar concentrations were
0.004, 0.009, and 0.006 mol/L, respectively). Figure 4a–c shows the removal efficiencies
of NO, NO2, and NOx under different
oxidizing conditions, and Figure 4d shows the average removal rates of NO, NOx, and NO2. It can be seen that the removal
efficiencies of NO, NOx, and NO2 by the three oxidants were different. The ability to remove NO of
the three catalysts was NaClO2 > KMnO4 >
Na2S2O8, which was related to the
average
removal rates of 98.34, 89.18, and 76.58%, respectively. The ability
to remove NO2 of the three catalysts was KMnO4 > Na2S2O8 > NaClO2,
and the average removal rates were 98.63, 76.97, and 45.29%, respectively.
The ability to remove NOx of the three
catalysts was KMnO4 > NaClO2 > Na2S2O8, and the average removal rates
were 88.45,
68.89, and 64.24%, respectively.

This phenomenon can be attributed
to the different oxidizing properties of different oxidants. The oxidation
of NO to NO2 and the further oxidation to nitrate can be
attributed to the strong oxidizing properties of NaClO2 (eqs 14 and 15).34 The oxidation of
NO to nitrate can also embed its oxidizing power (eq 16).34 To generate hydroxyl (OH•) and sulfate free radical
(SO4•–), Na2S2O8 can be activated in the solution. They can oxidize
NO dissolved in water to nitrite and then further oxidize to NO2, which is represented by the general formulae (17–23),34 and the final dissolved NO is oxidized to nitrate. 14   15   16   17   18   19   20   21   22   23  

In general, strong oxidants have a stronger ability to remove
NO
than weak oxidants. In practical applications, the quantity and type
of additives must be considered in a cost-effective manner, as well
as the safety of the additives, the degree of equipment loss, and
possible emission standards. After comprehensive consideration of
the above various factors, KMnO4 was determined to be the
best additive for subsequent experiments.

Figure 5 Effect of pH on the removal
rate of NO, NO2, and NOx. [NO]
= 500 ppm, [SO2] = 1000
ppm, [O3] = 250 ppm, and [KMnO4] = 0.006 mol/L.

3.4 Impact of pH
Figure 5 shows the average
removal efficiencies of
NO, NO2, and NOx under different
pH conditions. The initial pH was adjusted to about 5, 7, 9, 11, and
12 with HNO3 and NaOH.

Figure 6 Effect of the KMnO4 concentration
on (a) NO, (b) NO2, (c) NOx removal efficiency,
and (d) NOx average removal efficiency.
[NO] = 500 ppm, [SO2] = 1000 ppm, [O3] = 250
ppm, and [NaOH] = 0.025 mol/L, initial pH = 12.

The experiment found that the removal rate of SO2 was
as high as 100% in the whole process, and the denitration efficiency
was obviously affected. When the pH was 5.55, the removal rates of
NO, NO2, and NOx were 79.26,
33.86, and 43.46%, respectively. Then, as the pH increased to 9, the
removal rates increased to 80.40, 37.58, and 46.35%, respectively.
This suggested that acidic conditions were not conducive to the removal
of nitrogen oxides, which may be due to the fact that acidic conditions
were detrimental to NO absorption and that nitrous acid may be accelerated
under the strong acidic conditions (24). The
optimum denitration efficiency was observed at a pH of 12.13. The
removal rates of NO, NO, and NOx were
88.45, 70.11, and 57.15%, respectively. Therefore, in the subsequent
experiments, the pH was selected to be about 12. 24  

3.5 Effect of Potassium Permanganate (KMnO4)
Figure 6a–c shows the removal efficiencies of NO, NO2,
and NOx at different concentrations
of KMnO4, and Figure 6d shows the average removal efficiencies of NO, NO2, and NOx. KMnO4 (0.5,
1, 2, 3, and 4 g) was added to the absorbing liquid, respectively
(the molar concentrations were 0.003, 0.006, 0.013, 0.019, and 0.025
mol/L, respectively).

It can be seen that the concentration
of KMnO4 is the key factor affecting the removal efficiencies
of NOx and NO. From Figure 6a,c, it can be seen that with the increase
of KMnO4 concentration, the trend of NO and NOx removal rates changed basically similar. It can
be seen from Figure 6b that when the mass of KMnO4 was greater than 1 g, the
removal rate of NO2 remained above 94%. Figure 6d shows that with the increase
of the amount of KMnO4, the average removal rate of NO2 basically remained above 99%. When the dosage of KMnO4 was increased from 0.5 to 1 g, the average removal rate of
NOx increased sharply from 44.15 to 84.56%.
When the dosage of KMnO4 was increased from 2 to 4 g, the
average removal rate of NOx increased
from 88.15 to 97.86%, smaller than the previous increase. This may
be because the probability of collision increased as the concentration
of KMnO4 increased, and the reactions of eqs 25–29 can be promoted,13 resulting in an increase
in the removal efficiency of NOx. 25   26   27   28   29  

Considering the removal efficiencies of NO
and NOx and the cost of KMnO4, 1 g KMnO4 was
selected as the best dosage for the experiment.

3.6 Effect of NO Concentration
The initial
NO concentrations were changed to 100, 300, 500, 700, and 1000 ppm,
respectively. Figure 7 shows the removal rates of NOx and the
outlet concentrations of NO2 at different NO concentrations.

Figure 7 (a) Effect
of the concentration of NO on the removal rate of NOx; (b) Exit concentration of NO2 under different
NO concentrations. [SO2] = 1000 ppm,
[O3] = 250 ppm, [KMnO4] = 0.006 mol/L, and [NaOH]
= 0.025 mol/L, initial pH = 12.

It can be seen that the average outlet concentration of NO2 was kept below 1.2 ppm with the increase of the inlet NO
concentration, and the average outlet concentration of NO2 was 0 ppm when the NO inlet concentrations were 100 and 300 ppm.
The average removal rates of NO and NOx were basically the same. It is observed that with the increase of
the NO inlet concentration, the average removal efficiency of NOx first increased and then decreased. The
average removal efficiency of NOx increased
sharply from 55.24 to 84.55% under the condition that the inlet concentration
of NO was from 100 to 500 ppm, but when the NO inlet concentration
increased to 700 ppm, the average removal rate of NOx decreased. When the inlet concentrations of NO were 700 and
1000 ppm, the average removal rates of NOx were 67.54 and 54.14%, respectively. The reason for this trend was
that the dosage of KMnO4 is fixed at 1 g, and the higher
the inlet concentration of NO, the more KMnO4 reacted with
them. However, when the NO content was higher than 500 ppm, the increase
in the consumption of KMnO4 made the remaining NO to not
fully react with KMnO4; so the average removal rate of
NOx tended to decrease.

3.7 Effect of SO2 Concentration
In the experiment,
the initial SO2 concentrations were
changed to 0, 200, 500, 1000, and 1500 ppm, respectively. Figure 8 shows the removal
rates of NOx at different conditions of
SO2 concentration.

Figure 8 (a) Effect of SO2 concentration on
NOx removal rate; (b) the variance analysis.
[NO] = 500 ppm, [O3] = 250 ppm, [KMnO4] = 0.006
mol/L, and [NaOH]
= 0.025 mol/L, initial pH = 12.

Figure 8a,b shows
that the SO2 concentration affected the NOx removal efficiency greatly. The average removal
rate of NOx was 71.17% when the concentration
of SO2 was 0 ppm. After the addition of SO2,
the average removal rate of NOx will be
improved, indicating that a certain amount of SO2 will
promote the absorption of NOx. The reaction
obtained the best NOx removal efficiency
when the SO2 was 1000 ppm, and the average removal rate
was as high as 88.15%. The reason was that a large amount of KMnO4 can be consumed when the concentration of SO2 in
the solution reached a certain level and the reactions of eqs 30 and 31 can be promoted,13 so that the
amount of KMnO4 reacted with NO was insufficient, resulting
in a decrease in the average removal rate of NOx. 30   31  

The average removal rate of NO during the entire reaction
was similar
to that of NOx for the average outlet
concentration of NO2 was less than 0.2 ppm. The removal
rate of SO2 was 100% for a high Henry’s constant
appeared on SO2.

3.8 Effect of Temperature
The effect
of the reaction temperature on the removal efficiencies of SO2 and NO was investigated due to the important role of the
reaction temperature in the dissolution, diffusion behavior, and reaction
characteristics of the ions or molecules in the solution. The reaction
temperatures were changed to 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70 °C.

Figure 9a,b shows
the removal rates of NOx at different
temperature conditions. It can be seen that the removal efficiency
of NOx increased first and then decreased
with temperature, and the maximum removal rate occurred at a temperature
of 40 °C. When the temperature was raised from 30 to 40 °C,
the average removal rate of NOx increased
from 71.61 to 81.35%. When the temperature rose from 50 to 70 °C,
the average removal rate of NOx decreased
from 77.52 to 74.33%. Because the removal rate of NO2 reached
100% during the reaction, the removal rate of NO was completely consistent
with the removal rate of NOx. An increase
in the reaction temperature led to an increase in the rate of chemical
reactions and a decrease in the solubility of NO in aqueous solutions.
At the same time, the high temperature led to the accelerated decomposition
of nitrite, which reduced the efficiency of NOx removal. Although a small amount of SO2 appeared
in the initial stage of the reaction, the removal efficiency of SO2 reached 100% with the increase of reaction time. The temperature
also reduced the solubility of SO2,31 but this phenomenon occurred because of the high Henry’s
constant (1.2 M/atm) in SO2.

Figure 9 (a) Effect of temperature
on NOx removal
efficiency; (b) the variance analysis. [NO] = 500 ppm, [SO2] = 1000 ppm, [O3] = 250 ppm, [KMnO4] = 0.006
mol/L, and [NaOH] = 0.025 mol/L, initial pH = 12.

Under the optimal experimental conditions, Fang et al. found that
the removal efficiencies of NOx and SO2 can reach 82 and 99%, respectively.35 Wang et al. found that the highest NO removal efficiency was 82%.36 Under the optimal conditions, Hao et al. found
that the removal rates of NO and SO2 reached 82.7 and 100%,
respectively.37 Compared with other studies,
the removal rate of NOx under the optimal
conditions is as high as 81.35%, which indicates that we have successfully
achieved the simultaneous removal of SO2 and NO by ozone
and wet absorption.

4 Product Analysis
The reaction was monitored under the optimal conditions to determine
intermediates and products. The ion chromatography system was used
to detect ionic products in the absorption solution, and the entire
reaction time was set to 2 h. Table 1 shows the IC analysis results of the ionic components
and concentrations in the absorption solution during the entire reaction.

Table 1 Composition of Ions in the Absorption
Solution (mg/L)
T (min)	C(NO3–)	C(NO2–)	C(SO42–)	
30	69.71	 	276.24	
60	126.56	 	538.84	
90	179.86	 	780.82	
120	222.76	0.745	1020.84	
As shown in Table 1, the concentration of NO3– in the absorption
solution gradually increased with the increase of the reaction time,
which was similar to the increasing trend of SO42–. The concentration of NO2– in the first
1.5 h was 0 mg/L, and the concentration was 0.745 mg/L in 2 h. The
strong oxidation of the system was the main reason for this result.
Because a large amount of oxidants and free radicals existed in the
system and NO2– was easily oxidized to
NO3–, but with the extension of the reaction
time, the amount of oxidants in the absorption solution will decrease,
resulting in the occurrence of the low NO2– concentration.

Figure 10a,b shows
the actual removal efficiency and the removal efficiency calculated
from the ion concentration in the absorption solution. As shown in Figure 10a,b, the calculated
NOx and SO2 removal efficiencies
were basically similar to the actual removal rates, indicating that
the theory is consistent with reality. The actual SO2 removal
rate was maintained at 100% throughout the reaction process. According
to the experimental results and the literature, we believe that oxidation,
absorption, and acid–base neutralization are the main pathways
for SO2 to SO42–. The elimination
mechanism of NOx is relatively complicated,
the mechanism of NOx removal can be explained
by eqs 4–24, and most of the NO will be converted into NO3– in the absorption solution.

and calculated NOx removal
efficiencies; (b) Actual and calculated SO2 removal efficiencies.
[NO] = 500 ppm, [SO2] = 1000 ppm, [O3] = 250

and [NaOH] = 0.025 mol/L, initial pH = 12.

5 Conclusions
In this study, the simultaneous removal
of SO2 and NO
in the industrial flue gas by ozone combined with wet absorption was
successfully achieved. Experiments showed that in the absence of SO2, the maximum NOx removal efficiency
was 64.60% when the injected O3 concentration was 250 ppm
(NO/NO2 = 1). In the presence of 1000 ppm of SO2, the removal efficiency of NOx gradually
increased, but the increase trend was slow after NO/NO2 = 1. The addition of KMnO4 was more conducive to the
removal of NO, and the more the concentration of KMnO4 increased,
the more the removal efficiency of NO increased. The tendency of the
NOx removal rate increased first and then
decreased when increasing the NO concentration. The experiment also
found that a certain amount of SO2 can promote the removal
of NOx. After considering the NOx removal efficiency and the costs, the optimal conditions
for NOx removal were determined to be
when the initial pH was about 12, the temperature was 40 °C,
the concentration of KMnO4 was 0.006 mol/L, and the concentrations
of imported NO and SO2 were 500 and 1000 ppm, respectively.
The NOx removal efficiency of 81.35% was
obtained under the optimal conditions. In this paper, the detailed
results can provide guidance on the promotion of simultaneous removal
of NO and SO2 by using O3 combined with NaOH
and KMnO4.
