This study examines the application
of poultry eggshell (PES) as
a source of calcium for the synthesis of hydroxyapatite (HA) via annealation.
The synthesized powder (poultry eggshell hydroxyapatite (PESHA)) was
characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), EDAX, and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) analytical techniques. This powder was used
for adsorptive removal of the Reactive Yellow 4 (RY4) dye in a batch
process. Results from morphological analysis by SEM and TEM revealed
that the microstructure of the apatite is made up of needle–rod-like
particles with the length of 15–60 nm, breadth of 4–6
nm, and crystallite size of 86.32 nm. EDAX revealed that HA has Ca/P
ratio of 1.63, indicating a nonstoichiometric apatite, whereas XRD
analysis presented it as a pure monophasic hydroxyapatite powder.
Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy indicated that the
adsorption is due to the electrostatic interaction between the functional
groups of the dye and those on the apatite surface. The maximum adsorption
capacity (Qmax) of 127.9 mg g–1 was obtained for the adsorption process, whereas the pseudo-first-order
model with R2 > 0.99 best described
the
adsorption mechanism. Furthermore, the thermodynamic studies revealed
that the adsorption process was exothermic and spontaneous in nature
with ΔH and ΔS values
of 120.79 kJ mol–1 and 0.395 kJ mol–1 K–1, respectively. Thus, hydroxyapatite fabricated
from the poultry waste of eggshell can be effectively utilized as
an excellent nontoxic and cheap adsorbent for the removal of RY4 dye
from aqueous medium.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Pollutants are ubiquitous
in the environment due to rapid urbanization
and industrialization, besides portending great danger due to their
accumulations in the living tissues; hence, their removal is a germane
issue. Effluents from industries such as paint and dyestuff have been
the focus of considerable attention in the field of wastewater treatment,
not only because of their toxicities but also because of their visibility.1 It is estimated that every year about 280 000
tons of dyes are discharged by the textile industries.1,2 A huge amount of water is needed in dye-related industries for cleaning
and washing purposes; however, their waste products containing highly
colored effluents with different dyes are often discharged directly
into the water systems.3 In the textile
industry, for instance, the release of dye waste products into the
ecosystem causes environmental pollution because of their toxicity,
mutagenicity, and nonbiodegradability.4 Reactive dyes, in particular, have been identified as the most problematic
dye, with respect to treatment, among other dyes because of their
resistance to conventional methods of wastewater treatment.5,6 They are colored molecules use for dyeing cellulose fibers, which
are characterized by nitrogen–nitrogen double bonds (N=N
azo bonds). Reactive dyes are chemically active, with very stable
but harmful products, especially in powder form.7 Because of the vast harmful effects of the dye-polluted
wastewater, it becomes very important to eliminate them from aqueous
solution.

Many conventional methods for the removal of color
and wastewater
treatment have been discussed over the years, which include physical,
chemical, and biological processes, elimination by oxidations,8−11 electrochemical method,12−14 adsorption,15−18 coagulation,16 membrane separation,19 and ion-exchange.20−22 Most of these methods however do not completely eliminate contaminants,
they generate secondary contaminant byproducts, and are very expensive
to operate. Among these technologies, adsorption is a common technique
used for dye removal from aqueous solution because of its being relatively
cost-effective, environmental friendly, and simple to operate.23,24 Several adsorbents such as Aspergillus fumigatusXC6,25 activated carbon,26 peanut,27 calcined
Mg–Al-CO3,28 rosewood
sawdust,29 sawdust and rice husk,30 calcined alunite31 as well as metal organic framework,32,33 and perlite34 had been reported for their abilities to adsorb
dyes from contaminated wastewater.

Hydroxyapatite (HA) with
chemical formula Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 is an important inorganic material
in the field of biology and chemistry.35 It is an excellent material with numerous biomedical applications,
such as in artificial bone grafting, dental treatment, and drug delivery
systems.36,37 Because of its excellent adsorption capacity
and ionic exchange property, HA has been studied as an adsorbent for
wastewater treatment, and its ability to remove heavy metal ions,
fluorides, and dyes from aqueous solutions had been reported.38,39 Poultry eggs are consumed mostly as food and in food-related industries;
it constitutes a waste when the shells are discarded. The shell is
porous with high calcium content that can be explored for HA synthesis.
This is expected to add values to this common agricultural waste and
improve environment. This study reports the synthesis of HA with Ca
derived from the poultry eggshell (PES); the synthesized poultry eggshell
hydroxyapatite (PESHA) was characterized using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM)/EDAX, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and thermogravimetric analysis/differential
thermal analysis. Application of synthesized PESHA as an adsorbent
for the removal of Reactive Yellow 4 (RY4) from aqueous solution was
investigated in a batch process; data obtained were subjected to various
kinetics and isotherm models, whereas temperature-dependent adsorption
data were analyzed for thermodynamics parameters.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Materials
Eggshells
were sourced
from a local poultry in Karaikudi, Tamil Nadu; ammonium dihydrogen
phosphate (NH4)H2(PO4) (Riedel-de
Haën, Germany), ammonia solution (EMSURE, ACS, reagents), and
RY4 (BDH, London) were used. Other reagents were of Analar grade and
were prepared with Milli-Q water.

2.2 Synthesis
of Hydroxyapatite
Eggshells
were washed with distilled water and boiled for 30 min. After boiling,
the samples were oven-dried at 100 °C overnight and crushed into
smaller pieces, followed by three-stage calcination at 800 °C
(at 5 °C min–1). A calculated amount of the
calcined eggshell was dispersed in 500 mL of Milli-Q water in a 1000
mL conical flask and stirred for 30 min. The prepared 0.45 M ammonium
dihydrogen phosphate (500 mL, (NH4)H2(PO4)) was added dropwise and stirred for about 30 min. The pH
of the solution was adjusted using ammonia solution. The mixture was
left for 24 h on the magnetic stirrer at room temperature for the
formation of hydroxyapatite and thereafter filtered. The powder was
dried in an oven at 100 °C for 12 h, and the solid particles
formed were turned into powder, calcined at 1000 °C for 3 h,
and labeled as poultry eggshell hydroxyapatite (PESHA).

2.3 Characterization of the Adsorbent
The crystal structure
and crystallinity of the synthesized nanoparticle
were characterized by XRD (X’Pert PRO, Netherland) using Cu
Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) at 2θ = 10–60°
with an incremental step size of 0.02. The crystallite size (D) of the sample was estimated using Debye–Scherrer’s
equation,40 whereas the lattice parameters
(a and c) were evaluated with Bragg
reflection.41 Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectra of samples were recorded with KBr pellets in the range
of 4000–400 cm–1 using FTIR spectroscopy
(Bruker Optics, TENSOR 27 series). Au-sputtered samples were examined
morphologically with SEM (Hitachi, Japan, S-3000H electron microscope
with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV) equipped with EDAX. Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained with a Tecnai model
instrument (TEM; Tecnai 20 G2 FEI, Netherland). The pH at zero point
charge (pHZPC) of the powder was determined using the method
described by Ezechi et al.42 A surface
area and pore size analyzer (A Quantachrome NOVA 2200C) was used in
the analysis of surface area, pore volume, and pore size.

2.4 Adsorption Studies
The RY4 dye used
in this study is a disodium salt of 3-[[4-[(4,6-dichloro-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)amino]-otolyl]azo]naphthalene-1,5-disulphonic
acid, a Reactive Yellow 4, CI: 12226-45-8 (Figure 1). The adsorption experiments were conducted
by adding different concentrations of the dye (40, 80, 120, 160, 200,
and 240 mg L–1) in a 100 mL flask with predetermined
amount of PESHA. The flasks were set on a temperature-controlled shaker
with the agitation speed of 150 rpm. The samples were collected at
different time intervals of 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min,
and the adsorbent was separated. The dye solution was adjusted to
the desired pH value with aliquot of 1.0 M HCl or NaOH (Merck) prior
to the adsorption study. The concentrations of the RY4 dye in the
solutions were estimated using a spectrophotometer (UV–vis–NIR,
VARIAN 500 Scan CARY).

Figure 1 Reactive Yellow 4, CI: 12226-45-8.

Similarly, the isothermal study was performed in a set of
20 (100
mL) flasks, where 25 mL of different initial concentrations (10–100
mg L–1) at pH 7 in pairs, 10 of flasks were contacted
with 10 mg of PESHA, whereas the remaining halves served as control.
The solutions were kept in an isothermal shaker (30 ± 1 °C)
for 24 h to attain equilibrium of the solid–solution mixture.
The flasks were then removed from the shaker, and the final concentrations
of dye in the solutions were determined. The amounts of dye removed
at time t, Qt (mg g–1), and at equilibrium, Qe (mg g–1), were calculated using eqs 1 and 2, whereas
percentage adsorption was calculated using eq 3 1   2   3  where Co (mg L–1) is the initial concentration, Ct (mg L–1) is the concentration of the
dye at time t in the liquid phase, Ce (mg L–1) is the concentration of the
dye at equilibrium in the liquid phase, V is the
volume of the solution (L), W (g) is the mass of
adsorbent, Abso is the blank absorbance, and Abse is the absorbance at equilibrium.

The mechanisms of the adsorption
process were investigated using
pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, Elovich kinetics, and intraparticle
diffusion models.43−46Equations 4 to 7 below were applied to describe the kinetics of adsorption
of RY4 to PESHA. 4   5   6   7  where Qe (mg g–1) is
the amount of RY4 adsorbed at equilibrium; k1 (min–1) and k2 (g mg–1 min–1) are
the pseudo-first-order and -second-order rate constants, respectively; Kid (mg g–1 min–0.5) is the intraparticle diffusion constant; Ci (mg g–1) is a measure of thickness of the
surface prior to the adsorption; and α and βel in the Elovich equation represent the initial adsorption rate (mg
g–1 min–1) and the desorption
constant (g mg–1), respectively.

Equilibrium
data were analyzed with Langmuir, Freundlich, Tempkin,
and Dubinin–Radushkevich (D–R) isotherm models (represented
by eqs 8–11) for adsorption isothermal studies.47−50 8   9   10   11  where Qo (mg g–1) and b (L mg–1) are the Langmuir isotherm parameters
related to the adsorption
capacity and energy of adsorption, respectively. The separation factor
(RL) expressed as RL = 1/(1 + bC0) provides important
information about the nature of adsorption. The value of RL indicated whether the adsorption process is irreversible
(RL = 0), favorable (0 < RL < 1), linear (RL = 1),
or unfavorable (RL > 1). KF ((mol g–1)(mol L–1)−1/n) and n are
Freundlich isotherm parameters characterizing the adsorption capacity
and intensity. The Tempkin isotherm assumed a linear relationship
between the heat of adsorption and coverage; the higher the heat of
adsorption, the lower the surface coverage. aT and bT are the Tempkin parameters
representing the equilibrium binding constant (L g–1) and heat of adsorption (J mol–1), respectively.
However, the Dubinin–Radushkevic (D–R) isotherm model
was applied for the adsorption process on homogeneous and heterogeneous
surfaces. It was initially formulated for adsorption with a pore mechanism
with assumption of surface inhomogeneity with adsorption energy distribution. Qs is the theoretical saturation capacity (mol
g–1), β is a constant related to the mean
free energy of adsorption per mole of the adsorbate (mol2 J–2), and ε (J mol–1)
is the Polanyi potential given by relation ε = RT ln(1 + 1/Ce), R (J mol–1 K–1) is the gas constant,
and T (K) is the absolute temperature of the equilibrium
experiment. Constant β gives an idea about the mean free energy, E (kJ mol–1), of adsorption per molecule
of the adsorbate when it is transferred to the surface of the solid
from relationship E = (2β)−0.5. If the magnitude of E is between 8 and 16 kJ mol–1, the process is chemisorption, whereas values of E < 8 kJ mol–1 suggest a physical process.51

The effect of temperature on RY4 adsorption
was investigated by
evaluating the thermodynamic parameters, such as change in free energy
(ΔG°), enthalpy (ΔH°), and entropy (ΔS°), of the adsorption
system. The equilibrium constant, Ke,
is related to the enthalpy and entropy change at a particular temperature
by the van’t Hoff equation.52 12  where Ke is the
equilibrium constant, which expresses the relationship between the
amounts of RY4 dye adsorbed (Qe) in mg
g–1 and the equilibrium concentration (Ce) in mg L–1. The expression for the
equilibrium constant is Ke = Qe/Ce, whereas the free energy
change of the adsorption reaction was estimated using expression ΔGθ = −RT In Ke

2.5 Statistical Test
The acceptability
and the best fit of a model are mostly based on the square of the
correlation coefficients, R2, which may
be appropriate for linearized models. However, because the least-squares
fit was employed for data fitting, there is need to compare error
distribution because choosing an error function may be indispensable.
Therefore, the sum square error (SSE) function (eq 13) was used to validate the fit kinetic models. 13  where N represents the number
of data points. The higher the value of R2 and the lower the value of SSE, the more acceptable the model.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Characterization
of PESHA
3.1.1 Morphological and Elemental Composition
Investigations
The morphologies of the PESHA powder synthesized
at 1000 °C before and after the adsorption process are shown
in Figure 2. The sample
powder showed needle–rod-like structures, which latter changed
to agglomerated particles upon adsorption of the RY4 dye. Careful
analysis of TEM (Figure 2c) revealed that the particles are rod-shaped with the length of
15–60 nm and breath of 4–6 nm. Information from selected-area
electron diffraction (SAED) revealed spotted and continuous rings,
suggesting polycrystalline grains, as depicted in Figure 2d. Figure 3 illustrates the elemental composition of
PESHA with distribution as shown in Table 1. The Ca/P ratio obtained was 1.63, indicating
a nonstoichiometric apatite, which is due to the presence of the various
trace elements in the apatite.

3.1.2 FTIR Analysis
The FTIR spectra
of the PESHA powder before and after adsorption are shown in Figure 4. The spectra show
well-defined absorption bands in the range of 1040–567 cm–1, which is characteristic for the phosphate of the
hydroxyapatite phase.53 The sharp peaks
at 567 and 603 cm–1 are assigned to the bending
mode (ν4) of O–P–O. Similarly, the
bands observed in the range of 1643–3381 cm–1 in the as-synthesized PESHA samples confirm the presence of adsorbed
H2O. However, the appearance of the bands between 3447
and 3577 cm–1 clearly represents the hydroxyl stretching
mode associated with the OH group of the hydroxyapatite. The presence
of the carbonate functional group was equally observed at 886, 1416,
and 1472 cm–1. The FTIR spectra of the prepared
PESHA powder after adsorption showed the basic vibration bands of
PO4 groups of the apatite between 475–480, 560–570,
and 1035–1108 cm–1. The peaks at 870 and
1460 cm–1 correspond to the ν2 and
ν3 peaks of the carbonate functional group from the
air. The broad bands in the regions of 1640 and 3530 cm–1 are attributed to OH– of adsorbed water molecules
and the hydroxyl group, respectively. Shift in peak positions, broadening
of peaks, and decrease in peak intensity were prominent after the
adsorption process, indicating the adsorption of the RY4 dye onto
the apatite surface, which took place through the major functional
groups (phosphate, carbonate, and hydroxyl groups).

adsorption

Figure 5 XRD patterns of synthesized HA from eggshell before and
after adsorption.

3.1.3 XRD
Study
The XRD patterns of PESHA
before and after adsorption are presented in Figure 5. The major peaks observed were compared
with the JCPDS standard data (ref code: 09-0432) for the HA powder
(HAp). Good agreement between the data obtained from the XRD diffraction
pattern of PESHA and JCPDS standard for hydroxyapatite affirms the
HA powder fabricated from eggshells. Particularly, the strong diffraction
peaks at 2θ positions 25.96 and 31.768° corresponding to
the (002) and (211) planes of HA were detected in PESHA. The appearance
of many sharp peaks suggests the formation of a crystalline structure.
Upon adsorption of the RY4 dye, there was no appearance of a second
phase, thus suggesting the phase purity and stability of the apatite.
However, significant broadening in the XRD diffraction peaks as well
as decrease in peak intensity were observed after the adsorption process,
suggesting the incorporation of RY4 dye into the apatite lattice.
The lattice defects caused by the adsorption of RY4 dye onto the structure
of PESHA were evaluated further by computing the unit cell parameters
(a and c) and the unit cell volumes
(V), and their values are presented in Table 2. The lattice parameters were
very close to the standard JCPDS no. 09-432 for the HAp. Both parameters
were smaller than the standard value for HAp. Whereas lattice parameter
“a” decreases on adsorption of the
RY4 dye onto the apatite structure, lattice parameter “c” and unit cell volume “V” increase after adsorption. The crystallite size decreases
from 86.32 to 51.61 nm after the adsorption of the dye, which corroborated
the results from XRD and FTIR analyses.

and initial dye concentration on the adsorption

The physicochemical properties of the synthesized
PESHA powder
were evaluated, and the results are presented in Table 3. This is essential because
the surface charge, surface area, and pore size affect the interaction
of the adsorbent with the adsorbate. The particle size affects the
contact area and the packing characteristics of the materials and
hence the macroporosity of the particle. The surface area, average
pore size, pore volume, and bulky density are within the range reported
in the literature.54,55 The pHZPC obtained
indicates that the sample has a slightly negatively charged surface.56

3.2 Adsorption Studies
3.2.1 Effect
of Contact Time and Initial RY4 Dye
Concentration on the Adsorption Process
Adsorption of RY4
onto the PESHA powder at different contact times and initial dye concentrations
was evaluated, and the results are presented in Figure 6. It could be deduced from Figure 6 that adsorption of RY4 onto
PESHA is time- and initial RY4 concentration-dependent. It was observed
that as the contact time and initial concentration of RY4 increase,
the amount of RY4 dye adsorbed on the surface of PESHA increases rapidly
for the first 20 min of the process, followed by a gradual increase
in the adsorption rate, until equilibrium was reached after 120 min.
The amount of RY4 adsorbed increases from 8.3 to 110.3 mg g–1 as the initial dye concentration increases from 40 and 240 mg L–1. These observations may be attributed to the rapid
saturation of the adsorbent’s surface by dye molecules, because
of which it becomes increasingly more difficult for the dye molecules
to find available vacant sites and, as such, no significant adsorption
was observed after equilibrium.57

Figure 7 Effect of adsorbent
dosage on removal of RY4 dye from aqueous.

3.2.2 Effect of Adsorbent Dosage on the Adsorption
of RY4
Figure 7 represents the effect of varying amount of the adsorbent on the
adsorption of RY4 dye from aqueous solution. The results showed that
the amount of the dye adsorbed increases from 63.4 to 88.6% as the
adsorbent dosage increases from 0.01 to 0.04 g, above which there
was no appreciable increase in the amount of the dye removed from
the solution, and as such, a mass of 0.04 g was utilized for subsequent
studies. The increase in adsorption as the dosage increases could
be attributed to the availability of vacant sites as the adsorbent
quantity increases; however, at a higher quantity, the agglomeration
of the particles affected the surface area, which led to insignificant
increase in adsorption capacity at a high adsorbent dosage.58

Figure 8 Effect of pH on the removal of RY4 dye.

3.2.3 Effect of pH on the Adsorption
of RY4 Dye
One of the most important factors that influence
the adsorption
process is pH; this is due to the fact that both adsorbed molecules
and adsorbent particles may have functional groups that can be affected
by the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+).59 The pH at zero point charge (pHZPC) of PESHA was estimated to be 6.84, as shown in Table 3. The implication is that above
this value the surface of PESHA becomes negatively charged because
the RY4 dye is anionic, lower pH, i.e., an acidic medium should favor
the adsorption of the dye due to the electrostatic interaction between
the adsorbent and adsorbate. Figure 8 shows the effect of pH on the removal of RY4 from
aqueous solution; the highest percentage removal of 93.4% was achieved
at a pH of 6.0, suggesting that the positive form of the adsorbent
was responsible for the adsorption of RY4 in the negative form. The
decrease in the percentage removal of RY4 dye at pH <6.0 may be
attributed to the formation of H bonds between the dye molecule and
the available H+, whereas the decrease at higher pH values
may be a result of the repulsive electrostatic forces existing between
the negatively charged surface of the adsorbent and that of the RY4.60

3.3 Adsorption Kinetics Modeling
Understanding
the kinetics of the adsorption process is necessary to elucidate the
full-scale optimum conditions. Figure 9a–d gives the plots of four different kinetic
models (eqs 4–7) employed to analyze the time-dependent adsorption
of RY4 by PESHA. Figure 9b corresponding to the pseudo-second-order kinetics appeared to be
best fit with the data, which is also in agreement with the values
of R2 obtained, as shown in Table 4. However, the pseudo-first-order
fit (Figure 9a) was
adjudged as the best fit because the values of Qe obtained (Qe calc) are consistent
with the experimental values (Qe exp) and, in addition, the %SSE in pseudo-first order is lower when
compared with second-order parameters. The Elovich model’s
parameters showed an increase in the adsorption rate as the initial
concentration of the dye increases, as shown by the values of α
(adsorption rate); this results from the increased concentration gradient
across the surface, and the decrease in desorption rate (β)
with the increased initial concentration could be attributed to the
formation of chemical bonds between the dye and functional groups
present on PESHA.

The intraparticulate diffusion
model was used to investigate the
mechanisms of the adsorption process. The increase in Kid values noted as the initial concentration of the dye
increases is a result of resistance of the surface boundary to the
increased driving force with the concentration gradient across the
adsorbent surface. The values of the intercepts, C1, obtained showed that the initial stage of adsorption
was characterized by both the intraparticle diffusion and external
mass transfer, with the latter playing a significant role.61

3.4 Adsorption Isotherms
The adsorption
isotherm relates the amount of a substance adsorbed onto the solid
phase of adsorbent to the concentration of the substance in bulk solution
at equilibrium at a particular temperature.62Figure 10 shows
the plots of four different isotherm models (eqs 8–11) used to
analyze the equilibrium data obtained in this study. The parameters
obtained from the least-squares fits of the models are shown in Table 5. The Langmuir isotherm
model gives the best fit with the maximum adsorption capacity of 127.91
mg g–1, with the value of RL of 0.04, suggesting a favorable adsorption of RY4 by PESHA.
The Freundlich isotherm parameter n > 1 also implied
a favorable adsorption process moderate heat of adsorption and the
binding energy obtained from the Tempkin isotherm suggested favorable
interactions between the dye and adsorbent molecules. The Dubinin–Radushkevich
model gave a theoretical adsorption capacity, Qs, of 84.29 mg g–1 with the maximum adsorption
energy E of 0.24 kJ mol–1, suggesting
a physisorption adsorption process. The overall comparison of the
isotherms using the average values of R2 shows that the isotherm fits are in the order Langmuir > Tempkin
> Freundlich isotherm > Dubinin–Radushkevich. Table 6 shows that PESHA
compared favorably
with other synthetic and modified adsorbents for reactive dye removal.

3.5 Thermodynamic
Studies on RY4 Dye Adsorption
The van’t Hoff linear
plot of ln Ke versus 1/T is shown in Figure 11, and the thermodynamic parameters
are presented in Table 7. From the tables, the negative value of ΔG indicates that the adsorption process is spontaneous in nature,
whereas the positive value of enthalpy change indicates that the adsorption
process is endothermic in nature.63 The
values of ΔH and ΔS obtained
show that the adsorption of RY4 onto PESHA can be controlled by the
entropic effect rather than the enthalpy change.64

4 Conclusions
This research work investigated
a clean, nontoxic, and ecofriendly
method for the synthesis of hydroxyapatite from poultry waste of eggshell
for the removal of RY4 dye from aqueous solution. The efficiency of
biomass material for the adsorption of RY4 dye was found to be dependent
on the reaction contact time, initial dye concentration, biomass concentration,
temperature, and the solution pH of the medium. FTIR results showed
that the adsorption of the adsorbent by the biomass was due to the
presence of the negative phosphate, carbonate, and hydroxyl functional
groups along its chains. High values of the correlation coefficients
of Langmuir, Freundlich, Tempkin, and Dubinin–Radushkevich
obtained inferred that all of the isotherms tested positive for the
adsorption of RY4 dye by the PESHA powder; however, the Freundlich
isotherm best described the adsorption process. Kinetic studies carried
out indicated that the pseudo-first-order kinetic model best described
the adsorption mechanism. Furthermore, the thermodynamic studies revealed
that the adsorption process was exothermic and spontaneous in nature.
Thus, poultry waste of eggshell can be effectively utilized for the
fabrication of important adsorbents, which can be deployed in the
removal of dyes from wastewater.
