The
human 5-HT2 receptor subtypes have high sequence
identity in their orthosteric ligand-binding domain, and many agonists
are poorly selective between the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C subtypes. Nevertheless, their activation is associated with different
pharmacological outcomes. We synthesized five phenethylamine analogs
in which the benzene ring is replaced by a bulky dibenzo[b,d]furan moiety and found a couple with >70-fold
5-HT2C selectivity. Molecular docking studies of the most
potent compound (5) at both receptor subtypes revealed
the likely structural basis of its selectivity. Although in both cases,
some crucial interactions are conserved, the change of the Ala2225.46 residue in the 5-HT2C receptor to the larger
Ser2425.46 in the 5-HT2A subtype, which is the
only structural difference between the orthosteric binding pockets
of both receptors, weakens a π–π stacking interaction
between the dibenzofuran moiety and the important Phe6.52 residue and breaks a hydrogen bond between the dibenzofuran oxygen
and Ser5.43, explaining the selectivity of compound 5 for the 5-HT2C receptor. We believe that this
effect of the residue at position 5.46 merits further exploration
in the search for selective 5-HT2C receptor agonists that
are of considerable interest in the treatment of schizophrenia and
substance abuse.

1 Introduction
Serotonin
(5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is a biologically important
neurotransmitter that plays key roles in mental states related to
mood, sleep and dreaming, appetite, libido, aggression, anxiety, cognition,
and pain. It also regulates peripheral functions in the gastrointestinal,
cardiovascular, endocrine, and pulmonary systems. The actions of 5-HT
are mediated by fourteen different receptor subtypes of which all
but 5-HT3 are class A G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Ligands that bind more or less selectively to these receptors have
proven effective in the treatment of migraine, pain, and a wide range
of psychiatric and neurological disorders. Among these receptors,
the 5-HT2 type is of particular interest because of its
affinity for molecules that are therapeutically useful in a variety
of conditions or induce altered mental states in humans. The 5-HT2 receptor family consists of three subtypes (2A, 2B, and 2C).
5-HT2A receptor activation is a characteristic effect of
classic hallucinogens, while inhibition of this subtype contributes
to the activity of some antipsychotic drugs. 5-HT2C receptor
agonists are of interest as appetite suppressants and, possibly, as
agents for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, drug addiction,
and schizophrenia, while antagonists may be useful as antidepressants
and/or anxiolytics.1−3 Finally, 5-HT2B receptors are commonly
considered as an “antitarget” because the extended use
of compounds that activate them can lead to cardiac valvulopathy,
and no clear therapeutic effects of 5-HT2B receptor antagonists
have been identified.4

The structures
of the endogenous monoamine neurotransmitters dopamine,
norepinephrine, and serotonin are based on the 2-phenylethylamine
(phenethylamine) and 2-(3-indolyl)ethylamine skeletons. Many variations
of the substitution patterns on the aromatic moieties of these scaffolds
and particularly on the phenyl ring have been synthesized and tested,
particularly exploring their psychedelic activity.5 The activity of these classic hallucinogens is ascribed
primarily to their agonist activity at 5-HT2A receptors,
and an early generalization was that 2,5-dimethoxy substitution of
phenethylamines, plus a small, preferably hydrophobic substituent
at C-4 of the phenyl ring is associated with strong receptor binding
and functional potency. Moreover, when the orientation of the electron
lone pairs on the oxygens is fixed by locking these atoms in dihydrofuran
or furan rings, affinity for 5-HT2 receptors (usually with
little selectivity among the three subtypes) increases due to postulated
interactions with hydrogen bonding residues in the receptor binding
site.6,7 Docking studies have confirmed that these
two oxygen atoms tend to function as proxies for the indole NH and
5-hydroxyl groups of serotonin (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Structures of serotonin and 2,5-dioxygenated-4-substituted
serotonin
receptor ligands.

Bulky ring systems have
been introduced in high affinity ligands
of structurally related GPCRs, notably in the successful beta blockers
carazolol and carvedilol (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Structures of carbazole-derived beta blockers.

Carazolol has been cocrystallized with the β2-adrenergic
receptor, presumably in an inactive conformation in which the carbazole
moiety occupies the orthosteric binding site.8 There are also a few examples of large anthracene-derived aromatic
systems that bind the 5-HT2A receptor with high affinity.9

Thus, a set of dibenzofuranylethylamines
with different orientations
of the dibenzofuran moiety were synthesized and evaluated for binding
affinity and functional activity at 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors. Also, models of both receptors were built using
the X-ray structure of the ergotamine-bound 5-HT2C receptor,
and docking studies were done for all compounds, to shed light on
the selectivity of these compounds on both receptors.

2 Results and Discussion
Two of us recently described the
synthesis of a number of dibenzo[b,d]furan-derived aldehydes, which appeared
as obvious candidates for further synthetic elaboration.10,11 Using these aldehydes as building blocks and assuming that the bioisosteric
dibenzofuran core might also fit into the orthosteric binding site
of 5-HT2 receptors, we prepared an initial set of dibenzofuranylethylamine
derivatives (1–5) (Figure 3) as candidates to explore
their affinity and functional activity at these receptors and performed
docking studies to illuminate the interpretation of our experimental
results.

Figure 3 Dibenzofuranylethylamines synthesized and tested in this work.

The aldehydes were condensed with nitromethane,
and in one case
instead with nitroethane, to afford the nitroalkenyl derivatives,
which were reduced to the corresponding amines 1–5 using LiAlH4. These were converted into their
crystalline, water-soluble hydrochlorides (Scheme 1).

(b) THF,
reflux, 16 h, then HCl/acetone, 65–72%.

The affinities of all five compounds for both 5-HT2 receptor
subtypes were determined by radioligand displacement assays ([3H]ketanserin for 5-HT2A and [3H]mesulergine
for 5-HT2C), and the functional activities were assessed
by a standard fluorescence assay, as Ca2+ mobilization.
The hydrochlorides of 2-(dibenzo[b,d]furan-2-yl)ethanamine (1) and 2-(dibenzo[b,d]furan-4-yl)ethanamine (3) had been
synthesized by another route in the mid-1900s and only said to be
“toxic”.12,13 The results are shown in Table 1.

f NA, not active. Compound
with partial
agonist activity but not sufficiently active to obtain an EC50 value.

Amines 1, 2, 3, and 4 failed to displace
[3H]ketanserin from the human
5-HT2A receptor by 50% or more at 10 μM concentration
suggesting, under the conditions of the assay, that their inhibition
constants were greater than 10–5 M. Nevertheless,
their Ki values at the human 5-HT2C receptor were all submicromolar, suggesting at least modest
5-HT2C/2A selectivity. Compound 5 had a low
micromolar Ki at the h5-HT2A receptor, and its affinity for the h5-HT2C receptor, Ki = 35 nM, was particularly striking. In the
functional assay, all the compounds were weak 5-HT2A receptor
partial agonists, although 4 was somewhat more potent,
with a low micromolar EC50 and a rather high maximal response
(88%) compared to serotonin. Compounds 1 and 3 were extremely weak partial agonists at the 5-HT2C receptor,
and 2 and 4 displayed moderately potent
full agonist activity at this subtype. Compound 5 stands
out with its 222 nM EC50 and is a 70 times weaker partial
agonist at the 5-HT2A subtype, its potencies closely reflecting
its relative affinities for both receptors. Interestingly, the location
of the aminoethyl group on the dibenzofuran skeleton does not seem
to be a crucial factor, particularly when 4 and 5 are compared, with the amine substituents at C4 and C1,
respectively. However, it may be noted that in both 4 and 5 the dibenzofuran oxygen lone pairs appears to
be “right” (plus a favorably placed flexible methoxyl
group in the latter), and in 3, it should be “wrong”
for hydrogen bonding to donor residues in the active site of the receptors.6,7

Amine 5 may be viewed as a structural analog
of 1-(5-methoxy-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-4-yl)propanamine,7,16 with the α-methyl group removed and annulated with a second
benzene ring to form the dibenzofuran system. The 5-HT2A affinities of both compounds are practically identical (though not
assayed in the same model), as if the negative effect of allowing
the 2-methoxy group to rotate freely was counteracted by the increased
hydrophobic and potentially π–π-interacting volume
of the added benzene ring. Assuming that 5 binds at the
orthosteric site of serotonin receptors, this would imply that the
additional ring fits into a hydrophobic pocket and interacts favorably
with one or more residues in this area, more particularly of the 5-HT2C receptor, conjectures that we addressed with docking studies.

The human 5-HT2C receptor was modeled on the basis of
its crystal structure bound to the agonist ergotamine,17 and a model of the h5-HT2A receptor
was developed by homology. Even though both receptors share a high
sequence identity (73% identity between h5-HT2C/h5-HT2A whole protein sequences), their binding sites exhibit at
least five differences, namely, at positions 5.46 (Ballesteros–Weinstein
notation:18 A222/S242, 5-HT2C/5-HT2A, respectively), 4.56 (V185/I206), 6.58 (S334/A346),
7.32 (E347/G359), and 5.29 (V208/L228). Of these differences, the
last three lie far away from the binding site of the ergoline moiety
described for ergotamine in the h5-HT2C crystal structure. Figure 4 shows overlaid models
of both receptors, with the ergotamine structure in its crystallographically
determined pose.

Figure 4 Overlaid crystal structure of the 5-HT2C receptor
(cyan)
and model of the 5-HT2A receptor (yellow-tan). The bound
ergoline in the crystal is shown in magenta.17 Nonconserved residues are shown as sticks.

Docking studies using the crystal structure of the human 5-HT2C receptor bound to the agonist ergotamine,17 and a model of the 5-HT2A receptor based on
this template, supported the hypothesis that our compounds can bind
in the orthosteric site. In the 5-HT2C receptor, aside
from the usual ionic interaction with D3.32, 5 forms
hydrogen bonds with T3.37 (at 2.8 Å) through its methoxy group
and S5.43 (at 3.1 Å) through the dibenzofuran oxygen bridge.
In addition, the two benzene rings of the dibenzofuran moiety participate
in face-to-edge π–π interactions with F6.51 and
F6.52 (at 4.7 and 5.6 Å, respectively). The binding region of
the 5-HT2C receptor compared to the 5-HT2A receptor
differs in the exchange of an alanine residue (A5.46) for a serine
(S5.46). According to our docking results, this replacement seems
to be pivotal for the different affinities displayed by 5 at the two receptor subtypes. In the 5-HT2A receptor,
the greater bulk of a serine (S5.46) residue is sufficient to push
the dibenzofuran system away from one of the TM6 phenylalanines, thus
increasing the distance to F6.52 (from 4.7 to 5.8 Å) and disrupting
the hydrogen bond between the furan oxygen and the S5.43 residue.
The dominant ionic bond between the protonated amine nitrogen and
D3.32 and the hydrogen bond between the methoxyl group and T3.37 located
in the 5HT2C receptor are conserved, even though the flat
dibenzofuran ring of compound 5 adopts a different angle
when binding in the orthosteric site (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Key interactions of 5 in the orthosteric
binding site
of 5-HT2C and 5-HT2A receptors (colored slate
blue). Nonconserved residues in 5-HT2C/2A receptors at
position 5.46 (yellow for A2225.46 in 5-HT2C (A) and cyan for S2425.46 (B) in 5-HT2A, respectively).
According to our docking results, this difference results in a significant
weakening of the π–π interaction with F6.52 and
of the hydrogen bond between the dibenzofuranyl oxygen atom and S5.43.

The better than 70-fold selectivity of compounds 4 and 5 for the 5-HT2C receptor, together
with the steric effect of replacing A2225.46 in the 5-HT2C receptor by S2425.46 in the 5-HT2A receptor suggest that unwanted 5-HT2A agonism might be
subdued by introducing bulky extensions of the aromatic moieties in
phenethylamine analogs. However, the micromolar or only slightly better
functional potencies of 4 and 5 are not
sufficiently attractive to warrant preclinical studies, and additional
compounds will have to be synthesized and tested. It should be noted
that both the 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors have
identical orthosteric binding sites, both with alanine at the 5.46
position, which would not favor selectivity between these subtypes
on the basis of the mechanism we are proposing here. It is therefore
possible that any compounds of interest that might be synthesized
would also exhibit high potency at the “antitarget”
5-HT2B receptor. Consequently, future studies of this family
will have to envisage such a possibility by including affinity and
functional assays at all three 5-HT2 receptor subtypes.

It should be mentioned that the ionic bond between the protonated
amine nitrogen and D3.32 seems to be the dominant interaction in all
amine ligands of class A GPCRs. S5.43 also forms a characteristic
hydrogen bond with the C5 oxygen of the hallucinogenic 2,5-dioxygenated
phenethylamines and phenylisopropylamines (see Figure 1), both S3.36 and T3.37 form hydrogen bonds
to the C2 oxygen, and F6.52 interacts with the benzene ring of these
smaller psychedelic molecules, while F6.51 does not.19,20 In contrast, F6.51 forms an edge-to-face interaction with the additional
benzene ring of the “superpotent” 25X-NBOMe compounds.21,22 We found all these interactions in the docking pose adopted by 5 in the 5-HT2C receptor’s orthosteric site,
but there is no C4 substituent to interact with a key hydrophobic
pocket in the receptor, which makes an important contribution to the
affinities of classic phenethylamine psychedelics.19 This lack presumably explains the relatively low affinity
of 5 compared to the 25X-NBOMes. It may also be pointed
out that they are reminiscent of the interactions observed in the
β2 receptor crystal structure where the carbazole
moiety of the antagonist carazolol interacts with D3.32, F6.51, and
F6.52.8

Regarding the weakly binding
compound 3, which is
practically devoid of (partial) agonist activity at both receptor
subtypes, it may be seen as a cyclized version of the 5-HT2A antagonist 2-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-phenylphenyl)ethanamine (2C-phenyl,
compound 7 in Trachsel et al., 2009).23 However, the orientation of the oxygen lone pairs on the
dibenzofuran ring is “wrong” for hydrogen bonding,6,7 as corroborated by the higher affinities of 2C-phenyl and the “Fly”
and “Dragonfly” compounds with “correct”
orientations and pKi values of 6.11 and
greater than 8, respectively, at the 5-HT2A receptor (the
5-HT2C affinities of 2C-phenyl and the “Fly/Dragonfly”
compounds are not available, nor are their functional activities at
this receptor). Nevertheless, it should be noted, however, that while
2C-H-Fly elicited a positive drug discrimination response in LSD-trained
rats, suggesting that it is a 5-HT2A agonist, and 3 is a very weak partial agonist, 2C-phenyl is an antagonist
at this receptor (Figure 6).

and “Fly” (with dihydrofuran rings) and “Dragonfly”
compounds (with furan rings).

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have shown that arylethylamines
incorporating
the dibenzo[b,d]furan ring system
as the aromatic moiety bind to the orthosteric site of 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors. In doing so, they can establish
ionic, hydrogen-bonding, and π–π stacking interactions
involving the same amino acid residues as their simpler phenethylamine
analogs and the N-benzyl derivatives of the latter
(including the N-BOMes). Furthermore, the π–π stacking
interactions in which the dibenzofuran moiety participates are analogous
to those of the carbazole moiety of the β-adrenergic antagonist
carazolol, cocrystallized with the β2-adrenergic
receptor, highlighting the bioisosteric character of these two heterocyclic
systems. However, in vitro studies showed that their Ki values at the 5-HT2C subtype are all submicromolar
and as low as 35 nM in the most favorable case (5), exhibiting
at least modest 5-HT2C selectivity. Moreover, 5 and 4, its next highest affinity analog, are full agonists
at the 5-HT2C receptor. In contrast, our dibenzofuranylethylamines
are partial agonists with worse or much worse than micromolar affinities
for the 5-HT2A receptor. The 5-HT2C selectivity
of 5 is explained by a single difference in the orthosteric
site, that is, A5.46 in this receptor and the bulkier and less hydrophobic
S5.46 in the 5-HT2A subtype, which displaces the dibenzofuran
moiety in the 5-HT2A receptor, weakening or abolishing
its interactions with other amino acid residues.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Receptor Modeling and Docking Methodology
The human 5-HT2C receptor crystal structure was retrieved
from the Protein Data Bank (ID: 6BQG, agonist bound state).17 The h5-HT2A receptor was modeled using the h5-HT2C crystal structure as a template by means of SWISS-MODEL.24 Even though both receptors share a high sequence
identity (73% identity between h5-HT2C/h5-HT2A whole protein sequences), their binding sites exhibit at least five
differences, namely, at positions 5.46 (Ballesteros–Weinstein
notation:18 Ala222/Ser242, 5-HT2C/5-HT2A, respectively), 4.56 (Val185/Ile206), 6.58 (Ser334/Ala346),
7.32 (Glu347/Gly359), and 5.29 (Val208/Leu228). Of these differences,
the last three are far away from the ergoline moiety binding site
described for ergotamine in the 5-HT2C crystal structure.17

All the dibenzofuranylethyl structures
were optimized at the DFT level of theory using the B3LYP functional
and the 6-31G(d,p) basis set as implemented in the Gaussian 09 package
of programs.25 RESP charges for all compounds
were calculated prior to docking studies.26 Docking studies were performed by means of AutoDock 4.2 in the orthosteric
binding site of the 5-HT2A/2C receptors.27 Grid maps were calculated using AutoGrid4 centered on Asp3.32
(numbering according to Ballesteros and Weinstein),18 defining a volume of 40 Å3 with a 0.375
Å grid spacing. The AutoTors option of AutoDockTools was used
to define rotatable bonds. Genetic Lamarckian algorithm was used under
the following conditions: population size 50, maximum number of evaluations
2,500,000, maximum number of generations 27,000, rate of mutation
0.02, and rate of crossover 0.08. The calculations were performed
with dielectric as the default setting. The most stable conformation
for each compound was chosen according to the best docking score,
the population of the conformation, and the activity reported here.

4.2 Synthesis of Dibenzofuranylethylamines
Solvents were purchased commercially (Merck) and dried prior to use
according to standard protocols. Additional reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich.
Melting points were measured with a Stuart SMP 10 melting point apparatus
and are uncorrected. NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance
III HD 400 spectrometer (9.4 T, 400.13 MHz for 1H, and
100.62 MHz for 13C) in appropriate solvents using TMS or
solvent peaks as internal standards, and the chemical shifts are shown
in the δ scale. All the NMR spectra were indicative of greater
than 95% purity. An ESI-MS Exactive Plus Orbitrap high-resolution
mass spectrometer, Thermo Fisher Scientific (Bremen, Germany), was
used for the final derivatives. All the experiments were monitored
by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) performed on silica gel GF254 precoated plates, and silica gel finer than 200 mesh was
used for column chromatography. Yields refer to chromatographically
homogeneous materials.

4.2.2 General
Procedure for the Synthesis of Dibenzofuran
Phenethylamine (1–5) Hydrochlorides
A solution of a dibenzofuran nitroethenyl derivative (4 mmol) in
anhydrous THF was added carefully and drop by drop to a suspension
of LiAlH4 (20 mmol) in THF at 0 °C. After addition,
the solution was refluxed for 16 h. The reaction mixture was then
cooled to 0 °C and quenched with a solution of sodium potassium
tartrate, and NaOH solution was added to maintain basicity. The resulting
reaction mixture was filtered through Celite. The filtrate was concentrated
and purified by silica gel column chromatography eluting with MeOH/CH2Cl2/25%NH3 10:88:2 to yield the free
amines (1–5). These were converted
into their corresponding hydrochlorides in moderate to good yields
(65–72%) by adding conc HCl to the free bases in acetone and
precipitating the salts by the addition of excess ethyl ether followed
by filtration.

4.3 Biological Assays
4.3.1 Binding Studies
Binding experiments
were carried out by means of standard radioligand displacement protocols
using CHO-h5-HT2A cell membranes (cells were kindly provided
by Prof William P. Clarke from the University of San Antonio, Texas,
USA) (receptor expression = 200 fmol/mg protein, protein concentration
= 4910 μg/mL) against [3H]-ketanserin (47.3 Ci/mL,
1 mCi/mL, PerkinElmer NET791250UC) and HeLa-5-HT2C cell
membranes (cell line was generated in-house) (receptor expression
= 150 fmol/mg protein, protein concentration = 2041 μg/mL) against
[3H]-mesulergine (84.7 Ci/mL, 1 mCi/mL, PerkinElmer NET1148250UC). KD values obtained for [3H]-ketanserin
and [3H]-mesulergine at human 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors were 1.21 and 0.67 nM, respectively. Briefly,
membrane suspensions (60 μg/well for 5-HT2A, 3 μg/well
for 5-HT2C) were coincubated (30 min, 37 °C for 5-HT2A; 60 min, 37 °C for 5-HT2C) with radioligands
(1 nM [3H]-ketanserin, 1.25 nM [3H]-mesulergine),
test compounds, and standard in assay buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl,
pH = 7.4 for 5-HT2A, 7.5 for 5-HT2C, Vi = 250 μL/well) in polypropylene 96-well
microplates. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of
methysergide 1 μM (5-HT2A) or mianserin 10 mM (5-HT2C). After the incubation time, 200 μL of the reaction
mixture was treated with binding buffer and filtered through either
GF/B (5HT2A) or GF/C (5-HT2C) multiscreen plates
(Millipore Iberica, Spain) pretreated with 0.5% PEI. Filters were
washed with ice-cold wash buffer (6 × 250 μL of 50 mM Tris–HCl,
pH = 7.4 for 5-HT2A or 4 × 250 μL of 50 mM Tris–HCl,
pH = 7.5 for 5-HT2C), and 35 μL of Universol Scintillation
cocktail (PerkinElmer, Alcobendas, Spain) was added to each well.
Radioactivity was detected in a microplate beta scintillation counter
(Microbeta Trilux, PerkinElmer, Madrid, Spain). Data were adjusted
to nonlinear fitting using Prism V2.1 software (Graph Pad Inc., Chicago,
USA), and Ki values were calculated using
the Cheng–Prusoff equation.

4.3.2 Functional
Study
Functional activities
were assessed by measuring Ca2+ release in CHO-5-HT2A or HeLa-5-HT2C cells. The day before the assay,
2000 (5-HT2A) or 10,000 (5-HT2C) cells were
seeded in 384-well black plates (Greiner 781,091). Using the Fura-2
QBT calcium kit (Molecular Devices), the cells were incubated with
25 μL of dye loading buffer supplemented with 5 mM probenecid
(Invitrogen) for 1 h at 37 °C. Changes in fluorescence due to
intracellular Ca2+ mobilization (λex =
340 nm, λex = 380 nm; λem = 540
nm) were measured using a calcium imaging plate reader system (FDSS7000EX,
Hamamatsu) every second after the establishment of a baseline. The
agonist Ca2+ peak in response to agonist addition occurred
from 10 to 20 s following stimulation (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information).
