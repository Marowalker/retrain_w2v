Redox free-radical polymerizations
have widespread applications
but still clearly suffer from poor time control of the reaction. Currently,
the workability (delay of the gel time) in redox polymerization after
mixing is possible thanks to two main types of inhibitors (radical
scavengers): phenols and nitroxides. Out of this trend, we propose
in this work an alternative strategy for time delaying of the redox
polymerization, which is based on charge-transfer complexes (CTCs).
Thanks to iodonium salt complexation, the amine (here 4-N,N-trimethylaniline) is proposed to be stored in
a CTC equilibrium and is slowly released over a period of time (as
a result of the consumption of free amines by peroxides). This alternative
strategy allowed us to double the gel time (e.g., from 60 to 120 s)
while maintaining a high polymerization efficiency (performance comparable
to reference nitroxides). More interestingly, the CTCs involved in
this retarding strategy are photoresponsive under visible LED@405
nm and can be used on demand as photoinitiators, allowing (i) spectacular
increases in polymerization efficiencies (from 50 °C without
light to 120 °C under mild irradiation conditions); (ii) drastic
reduction of the oxygen-inhibited layer (already 45% C=C conversion
at a 2 μm distance from the top surface) compared to the nonirradiated
sample (thick inhibited layer of more than 45 μm); and (iii)
external control of the redox polymerization gel time due to the possible
light activation.

1 Introduction
Redox
free-radical polymerization (RFRP) has widespread applications
even though most of the reference systems used—based on the
amine/peroxide reaction—were developed in the 1950s. RFRP is
a widely used technique that allows polymerization of composites;
clear, pigmented, or functional polymers; etc. of any size (generally
>100 μm thick) and without additional energy consumption
(which
is necessary, for example, for thermal polymerization)1,2 as the reaction in RFRP is carried out at room temperature (RT).
Redox polymerization occurs when an oxidizing agent (generally peroxides)
is mixed with a reducing agent (or reducing system3). A two-component (solids and/or liquids) mixing is therefore
necessary to initiate radical production. Immediately after mixing,
propagation of the RFRP occurs (see reactions (1) and (2) in Scheme 1). The workability
of the reaction mixture is therefore inherently very low, which is
an issue for many applications: the reaction mixture has to remain
liquid to reach the deepest part of the object to be cured, taking
sometimes minutes (e.g., in dental restorative materials). Therefore,
inhibitors were rapidly proposed to delay redox reactions in time
(see (3) in Scheme 1). Gelation time is then defined as the interval from the two-component
redox mixing to the gel formation, which is not liquid (workable)
anymore.

Scheme 1 Classical Initiation/Propagation/Inhibition Reactions for the
Redox
Polymerization Initiated by an Amine/Peroxide Initiating System
The most used reference for
redox FRP initiation is the 4-N,N-trimethylaniline (4-N,N-TMA)/dibenzoyl peroxide (BPO) system,1,2,4−9 which has been used in several applications, such as biomaterials,10,11 orthopedic medicine,12 bone cements,13 and also self-healing applications.14 This metal-free reference was discovered in
1951,15 and the effect of the amine substitution
on the aromatic ring clearly showed that 4-N,N-TMA forms one of the best combinations
with BPO.16 The radical-trapping
agents for reaction (3) (see Scheme 1) are commonly chosen from two families: phenols and
nitroxides. Indeed, the use of phenolic compounds as free-radical
polymerization inhibitors has been known for many years. They are
used as additives for the storage of vinylic monomers (e.g., ppm levels
of 4-methoxyphenol or MEHQ17) and can also
be used for time delaying of redox polymerization.18 Nitroxide is the other class of compounds used in the time
delaying of FRP.19,20 Particularly, earlier, 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine
1-oxyl (tempol) was demonstrated to have very interesting
radical-trapping properties for redox polymerization.21

According to the well-established literature, 4-N,N-TMA has been very
recently proven to form
a charge-transfer complex (CTC) in combination with iodonium salts
(Ar2I+).9,22 This has several uses:
(i) formation of a brand new visible-light photoinitiating system
(with 4-N,N-TMA/Ar2I+ or even more efficiently with 4-N,N-TMA/Ar2I+/phosphines);22 (ii) photopolymerization
of 8.5 cm thick samples;23 and (iii) redox
photoactivated polymerization (the redox system being 4-N,N-TMA/BPO, and the
photoredox being 4-N,N-TMA/Ar2I+). Nevertheless, this study did not consider
the amine complexation in the [4-N,N-TMA/Ar2I+]CTC as
a retarding/inhibiting strategy for the redox polymerization. Therefore,
in the present work, we will: (i) explore the influence of adding
di-tertbutyl-diphenyl iodonium hexafluorophosphate (Iod or Ar2I+; see Scheme 2) as an amine-complexing agent on the redox
gel time; (ii) compare the changes in gel time to well-established
inhibitors; and (iii) perform photoactivation of the system to show
the photoresponsive nature of the CTC as a photoinitiator and its
possible use for on-demand acceleration of the curing upon light irradiation.
This approach can be useful in different fields where on-demand curing
is required: adhesives, composites, dental cements, chemical anchors,
etc.

Scheme 2 Alternative Inhibiting Strategy Proposed for the Redox Polymerization
Initiated by the 4-N,N-TMA/BPO Redox System in the Presence of an Iodonium Salt
2 Experimental
Section
2.1 Chemical Compounds
All of the reactants
were used as received and are presented in Schemes 3 and 4.

Scheme 3 Main Compounds Used for This Study
Scheme 4 Composition of the Methacrylate Resins Used
4-N,N-Trimethylaniline (4-N,N-TMA), triphenylphosphine
(tpp), 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine 1-oxyl
(tempol), and dibenzoyl peroxide (BPO) were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Di-tertbutyl-diphenyl iodonium hexafluorophosphate
(Iod) was obtained from Lambson Ltd.

The efficiency
of the different redox systems was checked in a
model methacrylate resin (Scheme 4) having a low viscosity of 0.053 Pa s, containing
33.3 wt % 1,4-butanediol-dimethacrylate, 33.3 wt % hydroxypropylmethacrylate,
and 33.3 wt % urethane-dimethacrylate oligomer.

All redox/redox
photoactivated polymerizations were carried out
at room temperature (RT) (21–25 °C) under air (oxygen
inhibition is clearly expected,24 particularly
for the surface in direct contact with air).

2.2 Preparation
of the Two Components Used for
Redox Experiments
All redox formulations were prepared from
the bulk resins in two separate cartridges at room temperature (RT)
(21–23 °C): the first cartridge contained the oxidizing
agent (BPO) and the other one contained the amine and,
if mentioned, the inhibitor, the complexation agent, or the additive.
A 1:1 Sulzer Mixpac mixer was used to mix both components together
at the beginning of each polymerization experiment. The contents of
the chemical compounds will be given in weight with respect to the
resin. All polymerization experiments were carried out under air.

2.3 Redox Polymerization in Bulk Followed by Optical
Pyrometry
Temperature versus time profiles (optical pyrometry)
for 2 g samples (thickness, ∼4.0 mm) were followed here using
an Omega OS552-V1–6 Industrial Infrared Thermometer (Omega
Engineering, Inc., Stamford, CT) having a sensitivity of ±1 °C.

Photoactivation of the redox system was performed using an LED@405
nm (Thorlabs) having a light irradiance at the sample of about 230
mW/cm2. Its emission spectrum is available in the literature.25

2.4 Real-Time Fourier Transform
Infrared (RT-FTIR)
Spectroscopy
A Jasco 6600 real-time Fourier transform infrared
spectrometer was used to follow the methacrylate function conversion
versus time for polymerizations of 1.4 mm thick samples. The evolution
of the near-infrared methacrylate C=C double-bond peak was
followed from 6130 to 6200 cm–1.

2.5 Surface Curing Analysis (z-Profile) Through
Raman Confocal Microscopy
Raman spectra
of cured polymer surfaces were recorded with a LabRAM (HORIBA) spectrometer
mounted on an Olympus BX40 confocal microscope, operating at 632.8
nm with a 1800 line/mm grating. The carbonyl peak area (1690–1755
cm–1) was measured as an internal standard, whereas
the alkene peak area (1630–1660 cm–1) was
used to determine the C=C conversion. Spectra were recorded
on an uncured monomer to be used as reference for double-bond conversion.
For Raman surface analysis (Figure 4B), a 100× objective was used in combination with
a confocal hole aperture of 200 μm, giving an axial resolution
of 2.3 μm. Objective displacement in the air was multiplied
by a factor of 1.7 following a protocol available in the literature26−29 to access the “real” depth in the photopolymerized
sample, considering a refraction index close to 1.5. This procedure
was already applied in our previous work30−32 characterizing
surface curing.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Classical Inhibitor Strategies
The
interesting use of optical pyrometry (temperature vs time) to follow
polymerization reactions was introduced by Crivello and co-workers.33,34 Indeed, for fast polymerization reactions (<30 min), both the
gel time and polymerization efficiency (through exothermicity) can
be simultaneously acquired. For example, for 4-N,N-trimethylaniline/BPO in the presence of tempol, the gel time is roughly 200 s for the experimental
conditions described in Figure 1, curve 2. First, the redox reaction is inhibited by tempol and poor exothermicity (or conversion) is recorded
with a flat temperature curve around 25 °C. Then, around 200
s, strong exothermicity (characteristic of extremely high conversion)
is suddenly observed, i.e., the temperature rapidly increases from
room temperature to 100 °C. For the present study, we will consider
that the gel time is the time interval from the initial mixing to
the beginning of the exothermic peak.

Figure 1 Optical pyrometric measurements (temperature
vs time) under air
in the model methacrylate resin (thickness = 4.0 mm) for 1.0 wt % BPO mixed with 0.9 wt % 4-N,N-TMA and (1) no tempol; (2) 0.17 wt
% tempol; and (3) 0.34 wt % tempol.

For the present study, tempol was considered as the
reference inhibitor. In Figure 1, one can see that without tempol (curve 1),
the gel time is very short (about 30 s) and the workability of the
system is very poor even if a strong conversion (corresponding to
a 135 °C exothermicity) is obtained. Therefore, classically,
it is interesting to add a low content of inhibitor, e.g., 0.17 wt
% tempol (Figure 1, curve 2): the gel time was shifted to 200 s with still a
100 °C exothermicity. The redox reaction was delayed in time
thanks to the introduction of nitroxide as a radical scavenger. When
too much inhibitor is added (0.34 wt % tempol; Figure 1, curve 3), redox
polymerization is completely inhibited. The choice of the nitroxide
concentration is therefore a key parameter for good workability properties
(3–5 min gel time) with still significant conversions.

3.2 New Inhibiting/Retarding Strategy Using Charge-Transfer
Complex (CTC) Equilibriums
Here, we propose an alternative
way to delay redox polymerization. Instead of well-established radical
scavengers, we propose to form an amine reservoir thanks to the [4-N,N-TMA/Iod]CTC formation (see (0), Scheme 2) to decrease the free amine concentration.
Remarkably, the CTC reservoir will slowly release its 4-N,N-TMA content (1′) when
the free amine is consumed by BPO, leading to a longer
gel time.

Experimentally, one can see in Figure 2A that without some radical scavenger, the
addition of Iod does not change the gel time. 4-N,N-TMA/BPO (curve
2) and 4-N,N-TMA/Iod/BPO (curve 1) exhibit the same gel times
and exothermicity. Next, in the presence of 0.08 wt % tempol, the initial gel time of 4-N,N-TMA/BPO (about 50 s, curve 1, Figure 2B) increased to 65 s when 0.3
wt % Iod was added (curve 2, Figure 2B) and up to 95 s for 1.2 wt % Iod (curve 3, Figure 2B). For these experiments, exothermicities were still very high (120–135
°C). The iodonium salt is able to delay the redox reaction; this
can be described as a new inhibiting strategy in amine/peroxide redox
systems. However, this approach requires the presence of a small amount
of tempol to trap the first radicals formed (3) (Figure 2A vs 2B). When adding Iod, the temperature vs time
curves still exhibited very steep slopes from the beginning of the
exothermicity to the top of the exothermic peak. This fact is very
important: the best inhibitor strategies must be characterized by
the lowest impact on this slope to maintain a very fast polymerization
reaction.35,36

Figure 2 (A, B) Optical pyrometric measurements (temperature
vs time) under
air in the model methacrylate resin (thickness = 4.0 mm) for 1.0 wt
% BPO mixed with 0.9 wt % 4-N,N-TMA. (A) (1) with 1 wt % Iod and (2)
no Iod; (B) with 0.05 wt % tempol and (1)
no Iod, (2) 0.3 wt % Iod, and (3) 1.2 wt
% Iod. (C) RT-FTIR measurement (C=C conversion
vs time) under air in the model methacrylate resin (thickness = 1.4
mm) for 1.0 wt % BPO mixed with 0.9 wt % 4-N,N-TMA and 0.08 wt % tempol (1) without and (2) with 1 wt % Iod.

The same holds true when studying C=C conversion
vs time
curves using RT-FTIR (Figure 2C): without iodonium salt, conversion reaches about 82% after
only 75 s (low workability, curve 1), but the presence of 1 wt % iodonium
salt allows a significantly shift of the gel time (170 s, curve) while
maintaining a very high conversion of 78%. The slightly less steep
slope in the presence of iodonium salt (Figure 3C, curves 2 vs 1) is probably ascribed to
the dynamic nature of the CTC complex. A proposed structure of the
CTC is given in Figure S1.

Figure 3 Optical pyrometric measurements
(temperature vs time) under air
in the model methacrylate resin (thickness = 4.0 mm) for 1.0 wt % BPO mixed with 0.9 wt % 4-N,N-TMA; (1) 0.08 wt % tempol; (2 or 2′)
0.17 wt % tempol; and (3 or 3′) 0.08 wt % tempol and 1 wt % Iod.

As a result (Figure 3), from an initial 4-N,N-TMA/BPO/tempol having a determined
too short
gel time (100 s, curve 1), one can propose two different strategies
to shift gel time: first, one can classically add more tempol (curve 2) and achieve, e.g., about 200 s gel time; the other alternative
is to form an amine reservoir (CTC) thanks to the addition of Iod. Using this latter approach, the gel time can be shifted
up to 250 s (in the concentration range studied here); the exothermicity
is slightly reduced due to the dynamic nature of the CTC (reaction
(0) in Scheme 2). For
both strategies, very good repeatability and exothermicities are shown
(curves 2 and 2′ or curves 3 and 3′).

3.3 Photoactivation of the CTC Amine Reservoir:
Acceleration of the Latent Redox Process
Finally, the CTC
formed is very interesting as it can show very high photoinitiating
properties,22 particularly in the presence
of phosphines (such as triphenylphosphine, tpp). For
these CTCs, the acid generation (from the side reactions) did not
impede the FRP initiation.22 As a result,
in Figure 4, a 4-N,N-TMA/Iod/tpp/BPO redox photoactivable
system is proposed. As a result of the different inhibiting mechanisms
(particularly the high concentration of tempol at 0.10
wt %), the reaction without light is quite slow (gel time of about
120 s) and poorly efficient (50 °C; Figure 4A). On the contrary, to accelerate the curing,
a simple irradiation by LED@405 nm is sufficient to strongly accelerate
the gel time (about 60 s) and, more interestingly, to remarkably enhance
the polymerization efficiency (120 °C obtained). For the newly
proposed system, the photoactivation accelerated the gel time by a
factor of 2 (Figure 4), clearly showing that light enhances the radical generations compared
to pure dark redox processes. The effect of light can particularly
be seen at the top surface, where oxygen strongly inhibits the polymerization:
the tacky surface without light (inhibition layer of more than 40
μm; Figure 4B)
is not present at all when the light is turned on! The surface is
indeed already tack-free (45% conversion; Figure 4B), and the conversion is steadily increasing
to 70% (at 25 μm), which is outstanding for a very-low-viscosity
methacrylate resin in the presence of tempol.37

Figure 4 (A, B) Redox polymerizations under air in the model methacrylate
resin (thickness = 4.0 mm) for 1.0 wt % BPO mixed with
0.9 wt % 4-N,N-TMA;
1 wt % Iod; 2 wt % tpp; and 0.10 wt % tempol. Photoactivation (light ON) using LED@405 nm (230 mW/cm2 at t = 0 s). (A) Optical pyrometric measurements
(temperature vs time during curing) and (B) RAMAN confocal microscopy
characterizations (C=C conversion vs distance from the surface).

The inhibited amine in the CTC
reservoir can therefore be activated
at any time by a simple LED@405 nm irradiation (Scheme 5, (4)) to achieve interactive on-demand control
of the gel time in redox polymerization.

the Inhibiting CTC Resulting in the Acceleration
of the Polymerization upon Light Irradiation
4 Conclusions
In this study, the use
of an iodonium salt as an inhibitor of amine/peroxide
redox initiating systems is presented. In contrast to the well-established
literature on the use of radical scavengers (nitroxides or phenols),
the present study proposed amine storage in an amine-iodonium CTC
equilibrium to delay redox polymerization. The iodonium salt used
has the same influence on gel times or polymerization efficiencies
(e.g., double gel time with good C=C conversions) as another
reference retarding strategy. More interestingly, the polymerization
can be accelerated on demand by simple LED@405 nm irradiation to achieve
interactive control of the gel time. CTC photoinitiating systems have
already demonstrated excellent depths of cure (∼31 cm);22 the use of the dual inhibitor/photoinitiator
CTCs for composite synthesis will be presented in forthcoming papers.
For the general applicability of the proposed systems, a systematic
investigation using different CTCs will be necessary to select the
appropriate inhibitor/photoinitiator balance.
