Fatty acid molecules
9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid (C18:3), 9,12-octadecadienoic acid (C18:2),
and hexadecanoic acid (C16:0) possessing active functional groups
with the capability of fast electron transfer have been established
for effective corrosion inhibition of mild steel. In this regard,
a microalga Scenedesmus sp. is isolated and its fatty
acids have been studied to corroborate the adsorption behavior, attributing
the anticorrosion efficacy on mild steel in 1 M HCl solution by forming
metal–inhibitor framework. Electrochemical analysis has been
used to ascertain the surpassing corrosion inhibition efficiency at
an optimal concentration of 36 ppm with maximum 95.1% inhibitive performance.
The results of metallography with or without the inhibitor molecules
have indicated significant changes in surface morphology of mild steel
specimen for gradual enhancement in immersion time (72 h). Hydrogen
evolution reaction has been emphasized to observe the tendency of
significant decrease in the bubble formation in the presence of inhibitor
compared to 1 M HCl solution only. Surface morphometric studies (scanning
electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy) have also revealed
the excellent adsorption capacity of Scenedesmus fatty
acids on metal surface. Quantum chemical calculations, performed by
density functional theory, determined significant adsorption effectiveness,
based on the donor–acceptor capability between metallic surface
and inhibitor molecules.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
sustainable resistance of mild steel (MS) toward corrosion by employing
green biomass extracts has spurred the scientific communities and
technocrats to investigate a renewable, biodegradable, and economically
feasible way.1−3 The organic moieties have potential to produce an
adhesive layer on metallic surface owing to their increased rate of
physisorption as well as chemisorption characteristics.4,5 The green inhibitors obtained from plant extracts were utilized
to inhibit the metallic corrosion under acid environment.6−10 Therefore, the plant-based inhibitors were treated as possible replacements
of synthetic products. Moreover, the work of M’hiri et al.
(2016) emphasized the protective ability of carbon steel against corrosion
in acidic medium by integrating orange peel extracts to form a thin
film over the surface.11 At present, extracts
of Brassica campestris were employed
as an anodic inhibitor in chloridic solution, contributing 80–84%
inhibition efficiency (IE) to COR-TEN steel.12

Recently, plant-based oil components, such as linseed oil,
sunflower oil, and castor oil, have successfully contributed to optimize
the inhibitive power on metallic surface by tuning the electrochemical
behavior.13−15 It has been reported earlier that the lubricating
property of oil may aid to create an adsorption to the metal surface,
depending on the boundary regime phenomenon.16 Therefore, it could be envisaged that the long aliphatic chain polar
organic molecules are being adsorbed on positively charged metallic
surface by creating self-assembled films or barriers with augmented
corrosion resistance. Moreover, the surface properties of oil such
as surface tension, viscosity, and intermolecular interaction are
found for favorable metal–inhibitor interaction.17,18

Nevertheless, despite the nonrenewable and nontoxic nature
of plant-derived oils, a dilemma still persist in food with oils,
which not only perturbs partially the ecological balance, but also
faces a serious problem of commercialization. Moreover, another major
problem associated with its origin is the season-dependent nature
of the plants and their longer cultivation time. Therefore, it is
conceivable to look for a sustainable and economical source of oil
toward mild steel corrosion inhibition. As microalgae are abundant
and a sustainable source of oil accumulation, microalgal oil has been
introduced for the first time in our present study to elucidate the
anticorrosion proficiency of mild steel in acidic medium.

Microalgae
are eukaryotic, oleaginous, photosynthetic, and oxygenic microorganisms
widespread in the environment and are capable of undegoing facile
cultivation even in nonarable as well as fragile land.19 Harvesting solar radiation using photosynthetic
pigments, rapid growth rate, and atmospheric CO2 fixation
have demonstrated an incredible aspect for economic production of
microalgal feedstock.20 Microalgae biomass
has drawn an immense attraction for synthesizing numerous value-added
co-products, namely, carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids, in a diverse
manner.12 The algal extracts are usually
rich in heteroatoms, carrying active molecules, which have proven
their excellence in a wide range of acidic environment toward corrosion
inhibition.21−23 The available lone pair (nonbonded) and p-electrons
present in such organic inhibitor molecules promote the electron transfer
toward metal surface, addressing the failure of corrosion.24 However, it is hardly explored, and detailed
study is lacking to use algal extracts as possible corrosion inhibitor.

Generally, microalgal oil is composed of oleochemicals in the form
of tryglycerides, free fatty acids with saturated or unsaturated double
bonds, fatty acid methyl esters, fatty alcohols, and fatty amines.25 The chain-length distribution of algal oil plays
a key role to ascribe particular oleochemical applications. Long aliphatic
chains of fatty acids containing 8–12 carbons are essential
for surfactant synthesis, 12–18 carbons are ideally contributed
for biodiesel production, and 18–22 carbons are utilized as
lubricants.26 Plausibly, the unsaturated
bonds and the presence of active functional group in fatty acids (carboxylate
anion) increase the surface chemistry toward interaction with metal-vacant
orbitals and cations and play a pivotal role to enhance the adsorption
characteristics.27 Hence, microalgal oil,
referred to as green inhibitor, is expected to maximize the corrosion
inhibition efficiency by creating self-aggregated adsorptive barrier
on mild steel surface under acidic medium.

Keeping the motivation
of green approach, we have come up first to observe the anticorrosion
behavior of mild steel with the isolation of novel and bountiful fatty
acid-rich chlorophycean microalgae strain Scenedesmus sp. The entire characterization of Scenedesmus fatty
acid (SFA) extract was revealed by gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis. The adsorptive barrier formation
behavior was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The in-depth
understanding of microalgal fatty acid-based adsorption characteristics
toward enhanced inhibitive effectiveness of mild steel in acidic environment
is anticipated to build up a new window of inhibition study by considering
the ample possibility for large-scale utilization.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Microalgae Isolation and
Preparation of Fatty Acid Extract
2.1.1 Microalgae
Cultivation
A green microalga Scenedesmus sp. belonging to chlorophyta was screened from a natural fresh water
body, New Delhi. The axenic property of the culture was established
through repetitive microscopic evaluation under confocal microscope
(Nikon A1). On the basis of its fast growth in the photoautotrophic
culture condition, this strain was selected as a model microalga for
further study. The strain was identified on molecular basis by 18S
ribosomal DNA sequencing.28 The alga was
grown photoautotrophically in autoclaved Fogg’s medium,29 and the cultures were provided with a light
intensity of 100 μmol m–2 s–1 and 18:6 h light/dark period. The culture was maintained at 28 ±
1 °C with intermittent shaking at 100 rpm using an orbital incubator
shaker (REMI, CIS-24BL), and the pH was adjusted to 7–7.2 using
0.1 N HCl or NaOH.

2.1.2 Neutral Lipid Estimation
The neutral lipid globules (fatty acids) present in microalgae
were visualized by Nile red (9-diethylamino-5-benzo[α]phenoxazinone)
staining.30 After staining, the cells were
observed under fluorescence microscope (Nikon A1) via UV light with
emission and excitation wavelengths of 485 and 525 nm, respectively.

2.1.3 Extraction of Fatty Acids from Scenedesmus sp.
The fatty acid components present in Scenedesmus sp. were extracted with the mixture of chloroform and methanol (2:1
v/v), as reported in Rai et al. (2013) with little modification.31 The microalgal culture was centrifuged (EPPENDORF
1810R) at 8000 rpm for 15 min to concentrate the cell pellets and
then dried in a hot air oven (International Scientific Instruments
Co.) at 60 °C. The completely dried algal biomass (2 g) was then
mixed with 20 mL of chloroform and 10 mL of methanol. The mixture
was ultrasonicated for 10 min and kept overnight at room temperature
(RT) in an orbital shaker at 130 rpm. The mixture was centrifuged
at 5000 rpm for 15 min to collect the supernatant, and the same volumetric
fraction of chloroform–methanol combination was again added
to the pellet, followed by recentrifugation. The supernatants were
pooled together and 20 mL of chloroform was added to the mixture and
then shaken properly. Distilled water (20 mL) was added for phase
separation, and the lower organic phase was recovered and dried in
a rotary evaporator (BUCHI R210). This lower organic phase carrying
fatty acids was utilized as inhibitor (SFA) for consecutive experimental
studies.

2.1.4 SFA Characterization
The characterization of SFA was analyzed by gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (Shimadzu QP-2010 Plus with Thermal Desorption System
TD 20) by implementing Supelco as standard.

2.2 Metal Specimen Preparation and Its Composition
Metal
strips having a 5 × 1 cm2 area were cut from mild
steel (MS) sheet first and then grazed by an emery paper of grade
1/0 to 6/0 consecutively to obtain a smooth surface. Then, the MS
specimens were dipped in AR-grade acetone and distilled water. The
composition of the MS specimen used was C: 0.15%; Mn: 0.030%; Si:
0.18%; S: 0.024%; P: 0.03%, and the rest Fe.5

2.3 Weight Loss Method
The MS specimens were
immersed in a 1 M HCl solution for 3 h at room temperature for weight
loss measurement in the presence and absence of different SFA concentrations.
The MS strips were weighed in a systematic manner using a Mettler
Toledo electronic balance (least count ±0.01 mg). To determine
the weight loss of the test specimens, these were eradicated from
weight loss chamber, followed by appropriate washing and drying, and
then, the MS strips were measured. The process was executed repeatedly
in a successive way at various temperatures (303–333 K).

The inhibition efficiency (μwl %) and surface coverage
(θ) values were measured using the following formulae5 1   2  where W0 and Wi are the weight loss value in
the absence and presence of inhibitor, respectively.

The corrosion
rate of the MS specimens was evaluated by using the weight loss data
in the following relationship4 3  In the above expression, W is the weight loss of samples in milligrams, A represents
the effective area in cm2, t signifies
the exposure time in hours, and d indicates density
of MS. In our recent report, the MS density was kept at ∼7.85
g cm–3.

2.4 Electrochemical Impedance
Studies (EISs)
A three-electrode setup was chosen for the
electrochemical analysis using an electrochemical workstation (CH7041C).
A reference electrode of Ag/AgCl with a counter electrode using platinum
foil and a working electrode as MS specimens (1 cm2) were
employed for EIS measurement. The specimens were dipped in an electrochemical
cell containing 1 M HCl at various SFA concentrations. Tafel polarization
tests were conducted at a 5 mV s–1 scan rate by
altering the overpotential voltage in the region of ±250 mV with
respect to open-circuit potential (OCP). The Tafel polarization curves
were allowed to fit using CHI7041C software. Further, the corrosion
inhibition efficiencies (μP and μPR) were calculated from Icorr and RP, respectively, using eqs 4 and 5. On the other
hand, Rct (charge-transfer resistance)
and other impedance parameters from Nyquist plot were obtained using
Zsim 3.22 software with fitting of suitable electrochemical circuit,
and accordingly, μRct was calculated from eq 6, as below3,32 4   5   6  In the above equations, Icorr0 and Icorri signify corrosion current densities in the absence and presence
of SFA in 1 M HCl solution, respectively. Similarly, the polarization
resistance (PR0) and charge-transfer resistance (Rt0) were used for without SFA in acid solution, while PRi and Rti were indicated for the resistances with
SFA.

2.5 Surface Analyses
Surface images of
freshly smoothened MS specimen, treated with acid solution (3 h) and
inhibited with SFA, were taken by a scanning electron microscope (Carl
Zeiss microscope, SUPRA 40 model, Germany). Atomic force microscopy
(AFM) analysis of the MS specimens was conducted using an NT-MDT multimode
microscope (made in Russia) under semicontact mode. Acid-immersed
MS specimens were properly washed and dried in a vacuum oven at 30
°C for 5 min prior to surface examination.

The effect of
metallographic characterization with or without SFA was examined at
different time intervals using a Dewinter Fluorescence Microscope,
model no. DIGI 1000.

2.6 Quantum Chemical Calculation
Analysis by Density Functional Theory (DFT)
Theoretical analysis
of the inhibitor molecules was carried out by density functional theory
and optimized with B3LYP functional using Basis Set 6-31G. The electron
affinity (A) and ionization potential (I) were denoted as −ELUMO and −EHOMO, respectively. The other electronic parameters
like absolute hardness (η), softness (σ), fraction of
electron transfer (ΔN), and absolute electronegativity
(χ) were estimated by the following expressions5 7   8   9   10  

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Morphological
Characterization of Scenedesmus sp.
The
selected monoclonal microalgal strain was successfully isolated and
genetically identified by 18S ribosomal marker. The microalga was
identified as Scenedesmus sp., belonging to class
chloropheceae, order sphaeropleales, and family scenedesmacea. The
morphometric examination by confocal microscopy demonstrated the consistent
morphology of genera Scenedesmus (Figure 1a). According to the light/confocal
microscopic determination, each Scenedesmus cell
was observed as green with ellipsoidal shape having diameter in the
range of 2–3 μm. The cells were heavily granulated and
mostly present in single- and double-celled forms.

Figure 1 (a) Light microscopic
bright-field image of Scenedesmus sp. (scale bar,
10 μm). (b) Fluorescence microscopy image using Nile red staining
(scale bar, 50 μm). (c) Auto fluorescence image showing chlorophyll
(scale bar, 50 μm). (d) Merged image showing chlorophyll as
well as neutral lipid globules (scale bar, 50 μm).

The structural topography illustrated the coenobia
formation with the presence of tetrads and occasionally octet forms
of organization. The beaded forms of this particular strain possess
some spiny projections, contributing their fast movement. The Nile
red fluorescence microscopy revealed the lipid profile of Scenedesmus sp., as shown in Figure 1b. It was clearly depicted that the isolate
had a significant amount of intracellular neutral lipid droplets.
The cells of Scenedesmus sp. emitted intense red
fluorescent illumination, elucidating the existence of neutral lipids
carrying fatty acids.

3.2 SFA Analysis by GC–MS
To explore the application of microalgal fatty acid components,
as corrosion inhibitors, the SFA was analyzed by GC–MS. According
to the GC–MS profile, the presence of fatty acids along with
alcohols was represented by a chromatogram (Figure 2), and the results were summarized in Table S1. It was clearly revealed from the characterization
that the major fatty acids, viz., hexadecanoic acid, 9,12-octadecadieonic
acid, and 9,12,15-octadecatrionic acid, existed at 32.05, 10.36, and
27.02% respectively, followed by 8.21% alcohols. Among the fatty acid
constituents, total saturated fatty acid and unsaturated fatty acid
were found to be nearly 35.06 and 48.35%, respectively. Therefore,
we strongly believe that a higher amount of fatty acids could be utilized
promisingly for the anticorrosion efficacy of mild steel under aggressive
acid medium.

in Scenedesmus sp.

3.3 Corrosion Testing
3.3.1 Gravimetric
Analysis
Figure 3 exemplified the inhibition efficacy (IE) as well as corrosion
rate of mild steel surface with different concentrations of SFA as
9, 18, 27, 36, and 45 ppm in acidic medium for 3 h. The result revealed
that the inhibition efficiency enhanced gradually with increase in
inhibitor’s concentration up to 36 ppm, while there was no
significant escalation after adding more SFA. On the other hand, corrosion
rate decreased with increase in inhibitor’s concentrations
in a reverse manner of inhibition efficiency. This phenomenon could
be attributed to the adsorption capacity of organic moieties present
in SFA, based on surface coverage values. Therefore, the active sites
of mild steel were blocked considerably by adsorbed inhibitor molecules,
and hence, the inhibition efficacy enhanced gradually up to a saturation
level of SFA concentrations (36 ppm).

Figure 3 Corrosion rate and inhibition efficiencies
of various concentrations of SFA in 1 M HCl at RT.

3.3.2 Impact of Temperature
and Activation Parameters on Corrosion Inhibition
A comparative
analysis of inhibition efficiency (IE) on MS under acidic medium was
investigated in the presence of various SFA concentrations at different
temperatures (303–343 K) (Figure S1); however, concentration up to 36 ppm and temperature of 303–333
K were selected only for further studies. The influence of such temperature
ranges on corrosive molecules present in MS was generally studied
using Arrhenius equation, adapting the values of weight loss studies.33,34 11  In eq 11, Cr denotes
the corrosion rate of MS in 1 M HCl, Ea designates the activation energy at absolute temperature T (kelvin), R epitomizes the universal
gas constant (8.31 J K–1 mol–1), and A is the pre-exponential Arrhenius factor
for the corrosion process. On the basis of gravimetric measurements,
the apparent activation energy (Ea) with
pre-exponential factors with or without inhibitor concentrations was
computed by a linear regression between ln Cr and 1/T (Figure 4), and the obtained results are presented
in Table 1. According
to Figure 4, an evident
improvement of IE was observed with an increase of inhibitor concentrations,
whereas the IE declined with a gradual increase in temperature from
303 to 333 K. In the same fashion, it is apparent from Table 1 that the computed Ea values were boosted up with the enhancement of SFA concentration
in the presence of acid solution. These changes of Ea could be possible due to the circumstance that the energy
barrier of corrosive MS could be upstretched on addition of SFA to
the acid media, promoting the IE. Hence, the higher value of Ea in inhibited system in contrast to uninhibited
system (blank) specified that SFA were initially adsorbed on MS electrode,
governed by physisorption, a surface phenomenon. Thus, the observed
results clearly depicted the protective efficiency of MS in the presence
of SFA.

Figure 4 Arrhenius curve for MS in the presence and absence of SFA in acid
solutions.

Table 1 Activation and Thermodynamic
Parameters in the Presence and Absence of SFA at Varying Concentrations
SFA concentrations (ppm)	Ea (kJ mol–1)	A (mmpy)	ΔH* (kJ mol–1)	ΔS* (J mol–1 K–1)	Ea – ΔH* (kJ mol–1)

Thermodynamic characteristics, ΔH* and ΔS*, were attained by the plot between Cr/T and T according
to the transition-state equation expressed below33 12  where N and h signify Avogadro’s number and Planck’s
constant, respectively, and Cr, R, and T as explained in eq 11. Figure 5 illustrates a plot of , where
straight lines were found and the slopes along with intercepts were
calculated. All of the calculated values are presented in Table 2. From this table,
it was evinced that the values of thermodynamic parameters like ΔS* and ΔH* flourished considerably
in inhibited system with a significant enhancement of SFA concentrations,
compared to uninhibited system. This phenomenon focused an upsurge
in the ordering of electrochemical system with the deployment of inhibitor,
which depicted that the reactants of the corrosion reactions were
altered into the metal–inhibitor association to create an adsorption
over the MS electrode.32 Therefore, we
emphasized that the inhibitor molecules, present in SFA, fostered
the minimum energy prerequisite for the corrosion reaction, attributing
to the resistive property of MS in acid media.

steel in 1 M HCl with or without SFA concentrations.

Table 2 Calculation of Free Activation Energy
(ΔG*) and Free Energy of Adsorption (ΔG0)
 	 	ΔG* (kJ mol–1)	ΔG0 (kJ mol–1)

36	69.41	69.68	69.14	68.86	333	–6.08	
Free activation energy,
entailed as ΔG*, was estimated by the following
equation33 13  Positive values of free activation energy (ΔG*) at transition state were obtained, and the values were augmented
with increase in temperature for blank and inhibited systems (Table 2). This fact clearly
indicated that the tendency of active complex formation was repressed
partially owing to losing their efficient stability with upsurge in
temperature. In the same table, it was observed that the values of
ΔG* escalated with the increase in SFA concentration
at a certain temperature. Additionally, the standard free energy of
adsorption, designated as ΔG° for SFA
in 1 M HCl, was demonstrated from Kads values at different experimental temperatures, followed by the equation5 14  where Csolvent expresses the concentration of water
in solution (1 × 106 mg L–1). The Kads values were assimilated by the weight loss
data curve given at various temperatures (303–333 K) and are
given in Figure S2. The Kads values mainly decreased with increasing temperature,
which specified either lowering the adsorption rate or increasing
the desorption rate of SFA from the metallic surface. According to
the table, all of the ΔG0 values
followed the trend of <−20 kJ mol–1 at
different temperatures with or without SFA concentrations. A previous
report suggested that the values of ΔG0 remained up to −20 kJ mol–1, which
acknowledged the electrostatic interaction between charged molecules
and a charged metal surface attributing to the physical adsorption.5,34,35

Therefore, our experimental
analysis proved that all values of ΔG°
were consistent with <−20 kJ mol–1, and
hence, we strongly recommended that a physical adsorption was facilitated
in our study.

3.4 Electrochemical Studies
3.4.1 Open-Circuit Potential (OCP) Curves
Variation of OCP
of mild steel in HCl in the absence and presence of inhibitor at room
temperature was recorded before conducting any electrochemical studies.
It could be observed from the OCP curves (Figure S3) that the allowed time of 30 min was sufficient for further
studies. However, OCP values shifted toward the negative side with
addition of optimum concentration of inhibitor. This fact suggested
that inhibitor was more active for cathodic reactions.

3.4.2 Potentiodynamic Polarization Study by Tafel Plot
Potentiodynamic
polarization measurement studies provide an avenue to monitor the
mechanistic phenomenon of electrochemical behavior utilizing different
inhibitor concentrations on MS. According to Figure 6, the incorporation of inhibitors manifested
the corrosion reaction by observing the change in both cathodic and
anodic polarization curves. A thorough analysis of Ecorr values advocated that the employment of SFA induced
a shifting of corrosion potential in MS toward more negative potential
compared to Ecorr of uninhibited system,
indicating the inhibition on MS surface.

Figure 6 Tafel polarization curve
for MS with various concentrations of SFA.

The present study illustrates a maximum shift of around 63
mV for Ecorr in the presence of inhibitor
with respect to blank acid solution, which is less than the value
of 85 mV, demonstrating the inhibitor as a mixed-type inhibitor.36,37 Further, Figure 6 also depicts that SFA reduced the dissolution reaction of MS surface
at anodic site as well as retarded the hydrogen evolution reaction
(HER) at cathode. Moreover, the change in ba and bc values with the inhibitor concentrations
directed the inhibitive action of SFA by simply obstructing the reactive
sites of MS surface. The various parameters related to the kinetics
of MS corrosion, viz., Ecorr, Icorr, RP, ba, and bc (slopes
of anodic and cathodic polarization curves), were obtained by the
fitting of Tafel polarization curves with CHI 7041 C software, as
listed in Table 3.
Further, corrosion inhibition efficiencies μP and
μPR were calculated from the values of Icorr and RP. A close analysis
of Table 3 revealed
that the cathodic polarization slope was higher than the anodic polarization
slope at all inhibitor concentrations, suggesting that inhibitor was
more effective for retarding cathodic reactions (HER) than anodic
reactions on MS. An investigation of corrosion current values shown
in Table 3 accounted
for decrease in the corrosion rate on the electrode surface as the
value of Icorr continuously decreases
with increasing inhibitor concentration. The same behavior was also
manifested in the RP values (Table 3) because SFA molecules
were adsorbed on the active sites of MS surface and produced an inhibitive
layer, which results in its improved polarization resistance against
the corrosion process in the presence of inhibitor. Consequently,
it opposed the increment in Icorr value.
Such decrease in Icorr with increase in
the extract concentration acknowledged higher corrosion inhibition.
In addition, inhibition efficiencies, μP and μPR, were calculated from the values of Icorr and RP using eqs 4 and 5, which
were found adjacent to each other and followed the same pattern. Therefore,
this fact could be acknowledged that the elucidation of MS corrosion
behavior based on Icorr and PR values
accounted valid and reliable. Reproducibility of the experimental
data was also checked and is shown in Figure 7a,b. The average values obtained for various
parameters shown in Figure 7 are displayed in Table 3.

Further, to determine
the fact for increased RP values with
inhibitor concentrations in 1 M HCl solution, Langmuir, Temkin, and
Frumkin models were tested among various other isotherm models (Figures 8 and S3 and Table S2), where the Langmuir isotherm
model was validated strongly to give the best fit among the above-mentioned
isotherms. According to this model, our result demonstrated the value
of R2, i.e., regression coefficient, nearly
1 and the slope of the fitting line based on Tafel polarization data,
1, as depicted in the figure.

MS with various concentrations of SFA as per Tafel polarization data.

3.4.3 Electrochemical
Impedance Spectroscopy
Electrochemical impedance spectra
are represented as Nyquist plot (Figure 9) and Bode plot (Figure 10), based on the presence or absence of the
involvement of different SFA concentrations. Reproducibility of experimental
data was also checked and is exhibited in Figure 11a,b. Average values for all parameters related
to Nyquist plot are presented in Table 4. From the Nyquist plot, it was apparent that the polarization
resistance increased gradually with the increment of SFA concentrations,
representing the strong establishment of adsorptive layer formation,
which was also supported by other results.34,36

To explore the technical
characterization of the Nyquist plot, an equivalent open electrochemical
circuit was utilized, as indicated in the inset of Figure 9, where Rs is the solution resistance, CPE is the constant phase element,
and Rct is the charge-transfer resistance
across the MS–HCl interface. CPE is used for modifying the
capacitive behavior of the electrode and can be defined with Y0 and n, which are, respectively,
the modulus of CPE and a parameter that characterizes the deviation
of the electrode’s capacitive behavior from perfect capacitive
behavior. All of the impedance parameters like Rs, Rct, Y0, and n were determined from the fitting
of Nyquist plots with proposed electrochemical circuit using Zsim
3.22d software with relative model error and are listed in Table 4 (one of the fittings
for 9 ppm concentration of SFA is presented in Figure S5). From CPE parameters,36,38 the effective capacitance was calculated by the formula Ceff = (Y0Rct1–n)1/n.

A careful examination of Table 4 also promoted that Rct values were continuously augmenting with
enhancing the SFA concentration in acid medium. This is because of
the formation of an adhesive protective layer at the metal–acid
interface in the presence of inhibitor. This protective layer over
the metal surface blocked the corroding substances from reaching the
metal surface. Furthermore, it was observed that Ceff of the system decreased with increasing concentration
of SFA.

This could be attributed to either decrease in effective
exposure area or increase in the thickness of the protective layer,
which was also in good agreement with the Helmholtz equation, i.e., ,(17) where A is the available exposed area for corrosion and t is the thickness of the protective layer formed over the mild steel
surface. Bode plot (Figure 10) shows the variation of impedance modulus and phase angle
with frequency for metal–acid interface with SFA concentrations.
It was revealed from the figure that impedance modulus and the value
of phase angle augmented with each successive addition of SFA, which
supported strongly the retardation of corrosion rate.32

In addition, to study the adsorption characteristics
as well as the degree of adsorption, Figure 12 displays the fitting of the Langmuir adsorption
isotherm model for the experimental data obtained by Nyquist plot
for different inhibitor concentrations in 1 M HCl solution and supported
strongly the mechanism of adsorption behavior. However, the Frumkin
and Temkin isotherms were also plotted for the same results, and are
shown in Figure S4 and Table S2.

of SFA as per impedance data.

3.5 Surface Topographical Analysis
3.5.1 SEM
The formation of surface-resistive layer by green
inhibitors on the MS surface was confirmed by SEM topography. Figure 13 displays an array
of SEM images obtained for MS that was immersed in 1 M HCl without
and with the optimum concentration of SFA (36 ppm).

Figure 13 SEM image of MS surface
(a) polished, (b) in the presence of 1 M HCl, and (c) exposed to 36
ppm SFA in 1 M HCl. (d) The rectangular highlighted portion of (c)
demonstrates the SFA adsorbed on MS surface; these were seen as the
circled regions having a scale bar of 2 μm.

According to the figure, the MS surface was visualized as
nonuniform, flat, and scratched owing to its excessive roughness along
with asymmetrical polishing. On the other hand, the MS exterior was
dented rigorously with visible pits, which are accredited due to acid
attack of metal. However, the presence of green inhibitors successfully
suppressed the rate of corrosion due to the creation of adsorbed layer
on metal surface, attributing a smooth and uniform surface. Thus,
the SEM orientation of MS surface supported the electrochemical methods,
which could bring about the inhibition efficacy by adsorption mechanism.

3.5.2 Effect of Immersion Time on Corrosion and Anticorrosion
of Metal Surface by Microstructural Analysis
The influence
of immersion time on the corrosive as well as inhibitive performances
of MS is demonstrated in Figures S6 and S7. According to Figure S6, the metallic
surface was demonstrated as an irregular pattern, representing severe
deterioration in the presence of acidic environment by enhancing the
time span sequentially (0–72 h). However, Figure S7 indicates a completely diverged pictographic representation,
where the irregularity of metallic surface declined according to the
optimal concentration of the inhibitor (36 ppm). Hence, we strongly
assume that SFA could be utilized as an impending inhibitor to retard
the corrosion of MS.

3.5.3 Visual Photography Study
Our current investigation implemented a video [Video S1 (A) video blank (A0008) and (B) video inhibitor (A0017)]
about the similar observation of such metallographic analysis (Figures S5f and S6f) in the presence or absence
of inhibitor (36 ppm) at 24 h. It was clearly evinced from the video
that the amount of hydrogen gas evolution (HER) in the form of bubble
formation (cathodic reaction) was significantly higher in 1 M HCl
solution only in the presence of optimal inhibitor concentration.

3.5.4 AFM
The AFM images described the surface
morphology of MS after immersion in 1 M HCl solution, without and
with SFA. A thorough examination of polished MS surface was determined
as an almost even surface (Figure 14a), while, in the case of uninhibited system (Figure 14b), the metallic
surface displayed an extremely uneven topology due to an unhindered
corrosion attack, and the average roughness (Sa) increased from 39.09 to 138.51 nm. The presence of SFA (Figure 14c) in the acidic
medium determines a pronounced reduction of surface roughness, and
hence, the Sa value decreased at 45.09
nm, leading to a homogeneous surface morphology. Therefore, it was
elucidated from the overall pictorial and quantitative observation
that this noteworthy enhancement of the inhibited mild steel specimens
in the presence of SFA could be able to isolate the metal from electrolyte
and prevent from corrosion.

1 M HCl, and (c) in 1 M HCl + 36 ppm SFA.

Other parameters related to surface roughness were obtained
from software and are shown in Table S3.

3.6 Mechanistic Perception and Quantum Chemical
Calculation Studies
It is a well-recognized fact that fatty
acids are represented extensively as friction modifiers having inherent
lubricating properties.39 Microalgae-derived
oil comprised fatty acids, and its derivatives are primarily considered
as triacylglycerol. In our present report, the GC–MS analysis
of SFA (Figure 2 and Table S1) demonstrated the characteristic features
of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, having terminal CH3, hydroxyls, carboxyls, and esters with allylic carbon atoms in their
backbone. Moreover, it was clearly visualized in Figure 2 that a cumulative amount of
unsaturated fatty acids existed in a greater extent compared to saturated
fatty acids. Generally, the double-bonded and more than double-bonded
compounds have one and more than one sigma and pi bonds, respectively.
Hence, it is quite efficient for double-bonded or more than double-bonded
compounds to break their pi bond with less energy requirement. Thereby,
plausibly, they could be able to form another complex causing an enhanced
inhibition potential. Furthermore, the unsaturated compounds have
more electron clouds owing to ease of bond-breaking capability, in
contrast to saturated compounds. Hence, from this aspect, it was coherently
considered that C18:2 and C18:3 (unsaturated fatty acids) have increased
inhibition properties rather C16:0 (saturated fatty acids).

Quantum chemical calculations using DFT were carried out to elucidate
the electronic structure along with the reactivity of inhibitors,
expressed at the molecular level.40 The
optimized structures of investigated inhibitor molecules (9,12-octadecadienoic
acid, 9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid, and hexadecanoic acid) are depicted
in Figure 15. In view
of acid corrosion, the neutral (protonated) state of the fatty acid
molecule is taken for studies as the fatty acids will exist in protonated
form in majority at low pH in comparison to its deprotonated form.41,42 According to the geometric optimization,
hexadecanoic acid (Figure 15a) is relatively linear, whereas 9,12-octadecadienoic acid
and 9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid demonstrated one or more bends in
its optimized structure, as shown in Figure 15d,g respectively. In addition, the highest
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)–lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO) plots for all investigated inhibitors were studied
for calculating different electronic parameters.

Figure 15 Structures of (a, d,
g) optimized, (b, e, h) HOMO, and (c, f, i) LUMO orbitals calculated
for 9,12-octadecadienoic acid, 9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid, and
hexadecanoic acid molecules, respectively, using DFT methodology,
where the gray, white, and red balls show C, H, and O atoms respectively.

The values of EHOMO and ELUMO, dipole moment
(μ), electronegativity (χ), global hardness (η),
softness (σ), and ΔN are summarized in Table 5. However, the DFT-derived
ϕ values for Fe(100), Fe(110), and Fe(111)
surfaces were taken from the literature as 3.91, 4.82, and 3.88 eV,
respectively,43 and in the present investigation,
Fe(110) surface was only considered due to its packed arrangement
and higher stabilization energy. Further, all of the molecular orbital
(MO) pictures were created by population analysis with 0.02 isovalue
via Gauss View, by Gaussian 09 program5,34 with B3LYP
functional using Basis Set 6-31G.

According to the quantum chemical theory, the higher EHOMO values of −6.3826 and −6.3793
eV, achieved by 9,12-octadecadienoic acid and 9,12,15-octadecatrienoic
acid, respectively, designated the disposition of these organic molecules
to donate electrons to an appropriate acceptor having vacant molecular
orbitals. Hence, we could promisingly envisage that the SFA molecules
have a pronounced tendency to donate electrons.

Similarly, lower
values of band gap, ΔE (ΔE = ELUMO – EHOMO), will be able to determine good inhibition efficiencies
as the energy to remove electron from the last occupied orbital has
been reduced. Therefore, ΔE, obtained as 6.0104
and 6.0066 eV, for 9,12-octadecadienoic acid and 9,12,15-octadecatrienoic
acid, respectively, reflected lower than the value observed by hexadecanoic
acid (7.2203 eV), as shown in Figures 16 and S8, addressing
more adsorption ability. Moreover, our current report followed the
order hexadecanoic acid > 9,12-octadecadienoic acid > 9,12,15-octadecatrienoic
acid, from the aspect of χ, which converse with the possibility
of higher inhibition efficiency.

Figure 16 Schematic illustration of metal–inhibitor
complex formation.

Literature reported
that lower electronegativity (χ) and higher dipole moment (μ)
of the inhibitor molecules lead to surge the inhibition performance
due to stronger metal–inhibitor binding.43−47 Therefore, it could be concluded that 9,12,15-octadecatrienoic
acid entailed with higher polarization power, higher effective surface
area, and higher electron contributing efficacy, which would be attributed
for enriched corrosion inhibition. Table 5 also illustrates that the values of ΔN found suitable for both 9,12-octadecadienoic acid and
9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid, indicating similar potential of electron
transfer.

Moreover, the differences between the EHOMO values of 9,12-octadecadienoic acid/9,12,15-octadecatrienoic
acid and the ELUMO values of iron (E1)
and vice versa (E2) are exhibited in Figure 16, which represented that E19,12-octadecadienoic acid–iron was slightly higher than E19,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid–iron, while E2iron–9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid was greater than E2iron–9,12-octadecadienoic acid. Hence, it could be envisaged that the inhibition efficiency of
SFA is primarily controlled by 9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid. Therefore,
the entire examination of SFA by DFT has recommended that the studied
inhibitor containing 9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid and 9,12-octadecadienoic
acid as its major constituents functions as effective anticorrosion
substrates for mild steel in acid solution.

3.7 Adsorption
Mechanism: Mild Steel–Fatty Acids Association
The
present report demonstrated the presence of saturated (C16:0) and
unsaturated fatty acids (C18:2 and C18:3), which acted as potential
inhibitors of MS corrosion under acidic solution. The organic moieties
present in fatty acid molecules existed with terminal carboxylate
anion (COO–), which could also show the electrostatic
binding with positively charged MS surface. Moreover, the presence
of conjugated and nonconjugated double bonds in fatty acids could
be able to share the localized pi electron with vacant d orbital of
iron. Additionally, binding of high-molecular-weight fatty acids over
MS decreases the available surface due to steric hindrance, addressing
the declination of corrosion. Generally, the Fe dissolution in aqueous
HCl environment encompasses the transfer of two electrons, and it
is controlled by OH– ions. The plausible inhibition
mechanism was explained by physical adsorption phenomenon, which occurred
due to the unsaturated bonds and the presence of active functional
group in fatty acids (carboxylate anion). The carboxylate anion of
fatty acid molecules may interact with Fe2+ for the formation
of metal–inhibitor complex and therefore decrease the dissolution
of metallic surface in the acidic medium. These R–COO– showed the bond formation with the surface Fe atom and evolved H2 molecules owing to retarded HER (Figure 17). However, deprotonated state may be in
minority due to low pH, but the interaction of the neutral state with
metal-vacant orbitals plays a pivotal role to enhance the adsorption
characteristics. Hence, the rate of Fe dissolution retarded gradually
with the involvement of inhibitors by forming a uniform coating on
metallic surface. It may help to enhance the rate of adsorption of
inhibitor molecule on metal surface. Hence, the contribution of unsaturated
molecules like 9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid and 9,12-octadecadienoic
acid toward the anticorrosion behavior over MS is higher compared
to that of saturated molecule, i.e., hexadecanoic acid, also supported
by DFT analysis. Therefore, a good insight depending on both experimental
and theoretical observations advocated that the corrosion inhibition
potential of the tested fatty acids followed the trend C18:3 >
C18:2 > C16:0.

HCl solution and inhibition with SFA.

Conclusions
Our current work portrayed a novel and
holistic approach to decrease the rate of mild steel corrosion by
deploying SFA in 1 M HCl solution with the impact on the mixed inhibition
strategy. The maximum inhibition efficiency with the incorporation
of an optimal SFA concentration 36 ppm was achieved at 95.1%. This
appreciable performance is exhibited due to the development of a protective
barrier composed of microalgal fatty acid molecules, wherein 9,12,15-octadecatrionic
acid and 9,12-octadecanoic acid have been emphasized to form a strong
metal–inhibitor framework, followed by DFT. Microstructural
analysis played a decisive role to confirm a strong resistive potential
of MS at different time intervals up to 72 h consecutively. The protection
of metallic surface from corrosion in the presence of SFA has been
developed by a strong physical adsorption phenomenon, obtained from Kads values at different experimental temperatures.
AFM analysis showed a remarkable reduction of surface roughness from
138.51 to 45.09 nm, contributed by SFA. Visual recording shows that
the amount of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is significantly reduced
in the presence of SFA inhibitor, compared to blank solution.
