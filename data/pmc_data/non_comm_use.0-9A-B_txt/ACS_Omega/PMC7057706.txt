Bone tissue engineering has emerged
as an effective alternative treatment to the problem of bone defect.
To repair a bone defect, antibiosis and osteogenesis are two essential
aspects of the repair process. By searching the literature and performing
exploratory experiments, we found that β defensin 2 (BD2), with
bifunctional properties of antibiosis and osteogenesis, was a feasible
alternative for traditional growth factors. The antimicrobial ability
of BD2 against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was studied
by the spread plate and live/dead staining methods (low effective
concentration of 20 ng/mL). BD2 was also demonstrated to enhance osteogenesis,
with higher messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression of the osteogenic
markers collagen I (Col1), runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2),
osteopontin (Opn), and osteocalcin (Ocn) in vitro (1.5–2.5-fold
increase compared with the control group in the most effective concentration
group), which was consistent with the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and
alizarin red S (ARS) staining results. We implanted poly(sebacoyl
diglyceride) (PSeD) combined with BD2 and rat bone tissue-derived
mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs) under the back skin of rats and found
that the inflammatory response was significantly lower with this combination
than with the PSeD/rBMSCs scaffold without BD2 and the pure PSeD group
and was similar to the control group. Importantly, when assessed in
a critical-sized in vivo rat 8 m diameter calvaria defect model, a
scaffold we developed combining bifunctional BD2 with porous organic
polymer displayed an osteogenic effect that was 160–200% greater
than the control group. The in vivo study results revealed a significant
osteogenic response and antimicrobial effect and were consistent with
the in vitro results. In summary, BD2 displayed a great potential
of simultaneously promoting bone regeneration and preventing infection
and could provide a viable alternative to traditional growth factors
applied in bone defect repair.

==== Body
Introduction
Perioperative infection is an intractable issue of bone defect reconstruction
that always challenges doctors and researchers, particularly when
the self-healing capacity of the fragile and complex-structured craniofacial
bone may be compromised by potential or active bacterial activity.
Once an infection is present, bone regeneration is inhibited. The
traditional therapy of local or systemic antibiotic use readily triggers
drug resistance in clinical practice and always requires long-term
rehabilitation. In an orbital bone defect, the connection between
the orbit and the paranasal sinus combined with the fistula caused
by the bone defect can provide access to the bacteria outside and
readily lead to chronic bacterial infections, increasing the difficulty
of controlling the infection and causing bone reconstruction delay.
Recovery from this situation always requires several months to years
using the current clinical treatments, including local and systemic
antibiotic administration, because of the long-term external component
appliance and related side effects. Furthermore, there are reports
revealing that some antibiotics, including gentamycin, can accelerate
the degradation and reduce the mechanical strength of the newly formed
bone1 and that the adjunctive appliance
of antibiotics displayed no positive impact on implants with an unmodified
surface in periimplantitis2 and the time
of impact was limited.3 Another popular
antimicrobial drug is the silver nanoparticle, which is reported to
be cytotoxic through interacting with mitochondria and inducing apoptotic
pathways. These problems together inspired the development of the
concept of autogenous replacement with antimicrobial activity. Recently,
in attempting to find a substitute for antibiotics and considering
the limited sources of growth factors in bone tissue engineering,
antibacterial peptide (ABP) was taken into consideration.

ABP
is a small molecular peptide consisting of 20–60 amino acid
residues. Most ABPs are characterized by strong alkalinity, thermal
stability, and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, which is the
basis for the stable and long-term antibacterial effects. Researchers
have already applied ABPs to bone tissue engineering for implant-associated
bone infections.4 Among the ABPs, β-defensins
(BDs) are reported to have wide availability and favorable prices.
BDs are secreted by epithelial cells and white blood cells when the
body encounters physical or chemical stimulation and bacterial infection.5,6 Regarding their antimicrobial ability, they have been demonstrated
to be effective against virus infection,7 in the activation of the innate immune of periodontal tissues,8 and in the protection of the reproductive system
from pathogens.9 There is also evidence
that BDs contribute to cell proliferation and differentiation, including
stimulation of T cell proliferation,9,10 regulation
of macrophage activation and orientation,11 and promotion of dendritic cell maturation with Toll-like receptors.12,13 Scientists have applied defensins in tissue reconstruction, including
epithelium wound healing.14 Among the BDs,
β-defensin 2 (BD2) can act like traditional ABPs, supporting
resistance to bacterial infections, including Actinobacillus
pleuropneumonia infection.15 It was shown that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) transfected
with recombinant adenovirus expressing human BD2 could promote wound
healing.16 BD2 has been corroborated to
be able to directly promote the proliferation and differentiation
of osteoblast-like MG63 cells, which belong to the osteogenic cell
line but cannot be implanted in the body because of the risk of carcinogenesis.17 However, the osteogenesis potential of BD2 on
strains of the primary cells without the risks of overproliferation
and carcinogenesis remains to be discussed. Based on earlier studies,
we speculated that BD2 could promote mesenchymal stem cells, for example,
by stimulating BMSC osteogenic differentiation and thereby accelerate
bone regeneration in vivo via the bifunction of osteogenesis and antimicrobial
activity against microorganisms.

In recent years, we have proven
that poly(sebacoyl diglyceride) (PSeD) with exposed hydroxyl groups
can be linked to bifunctional active molecules, including growth factors,
peptide, and chemical groups, making it a potential alternative treatment
for bone regeneration.18−21 These results consolidated the experimental
basis for BD2-related bone tissue engineering.

In the present
study, we demonstrated the antibacterial ability and the optimum osteogenic
concentration of BD2 on rat BMSCs (rBMSCs) in vitro. Subsequently,
we combined PSeD with rBMSCs and BD2 (PSeD/rBMSCs/BD2) to repair a
critical craniofacial defect in rats and detected the osteogenic effect
of BD2 in vivo. We found that BD2 was an effective antibacterial starting
from 20 ng/mL. At the same concentration, the relative osteogenic
messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels were increased such that this
could promote the osteogenic differentiation of rBMSCs and play an
important role in the prevention and treatment of infection during
the perioperative period. Furthermore, within a certain concentration
range, BD2 displayed no biotoxicity on rBMSCs, such that BD2 application
in the clinical setting will likely be safe. The combination of PSeD/rBMSCs/BD2
also showed excellent effectiveness in rat critical calvaria defect
reconstruction in vivo.

The combination of BD2, rBMSCs, and
PSeD is a bifunctional scaffold that could concurrently treat perioperative
infections and promote osteogenesis, providing an innovative and efficient
solution for bone defect reconstruction.

Results and Discussion
Bone defect repair appears to be
the main target of bone tissue engineering. Scientists have paid great
attention to traditional growth factors in previous years. Bone morphogenetic
protein (BMP) can induce the differentiation of BMSCs to osteoblasts
and promote the proliferation of osteoblasts and chondroblasts.22 Experiments indicated that the calcium phosphate
cement scaffold carrying BMP-2 effectively induced osteogenesis, osteoinduction,
and osteoconduction and could successfully repair a leporid orbital
defect.23 In addition, a coral scaffold
carrying recombinant human BMP-2 (rhBMP-2) was able to repair orbital
defects in a canine24 and a rabbit model.25 Researchers found that rhBMP-2 application was
accompanied by side effects, including tissue swelling and seroma,
and once the implant with rhBMP-2 was removed, the swelling was soon
reduced.26 Because of a strong and positive
correlation between frequencies of side effects and the rhBMP-2 doses
in the repair of a rat critical craniofacial defect, determining the
effective dose of rhBMP-2 to balance bone regeneration and maturation
appears to be essential.27 Vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) itself can promote angiogenesis, increase vessel
permeability, and accelerate the recruitment of MSCs and osteoprogenitor
cells. On the association of VEGF with BMP-2, this ensures cell survival,
stimulates bone mineralization, and promotes the shape and absorption
of cartilage, while at the same time interfering with the signaling
pathway between BMPs and VEGFs.28

Infection is another complex problem during the perioperative period.
In the case of open fractures, infection is always associated with
nonunion, such that we need to consider antibiosis as well as bone
defect reconstruction. However, none of the traditional growth factors
are able to fulfill both the osteogenic and antibacterial activities.
The traditional method of treating infection is antibiotics, which
are broadly and effectively used in the treatment of infected bone
defects.29 However, antibiotics may fail
when the bacteria has already caused an infectious nonunion. Additionally,
prophylactic antibiotic use may lead to antibiotic overprescription.

The ABPs are safe and effective substitutes for antibiotics. These
polypeptides have relatively shorter peptide chains compared with
proteins like BMP-2, such that it is easier for scaffolds to carry
them than a whole protein. In addition to the wide array of antimicrobial
ability, some ABPs have been demonstrated to inhibit implantation
rejection.30 BDs, produced by epithelium
and immunocytes, have the traditional function of maintaining the
dynamic equilibrium between the host and the microorganism and preventing
the potential infection of the enteric, productive, oral, and respiratory
systems.15 BDs have also been reported
to be effective in an Staphylococcus aureus-infected rat calvaria defect31 but displayed
no extra osteogenic effects compared with the uninfected wild-type
BMSC group in this study. Indeed, few researchers have focused on
the osteogenic ability of BDs. Among the BDs, BD2 has been reported
to contribute to the antibacterial as well as the wound-healing process.
This encouraged us to investigate the differentiation potential of
BD2. In the present study, we assessed the antimicrobial ability and
the osteogenic effects of BD2 in vitro. Furthermore, we combined it
with the porous scaffold PSeD and then evaluated the anti-inflammatory
ability and osteogenic response in vivo.

It was previously proven
that BD2 has an antimicrobial activity.32 However, the reported minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of
human BD2 against wild-type strains of S. aureus of 4–10 μg/mL33 is much
greater than the biological activity concentration (0.1–100.0
ng/mL) of rat BD2 we used in the present study. Therefore, we decided
to test the antibiosis of BD2 against both Gram-negative bacteria
(Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive
bacteria (S. aureus) at different concentrations
within the biological activity concentration range. We examined the
antimicrobial activity of different BD2 concentrations (0, 10, 20,
40, 80 ng/mL). From the preliminary study, we found a MIC for BD2
of 20 ng/mL (Figure 1). We inoculated the bacteria into a broth containing 20 ng/mL BD2.
After incubation for 6 h, we found that E. coli (Figure 2A) and S. aureus (Figure 2B) were inhibited in the BD2 group by gross observation
of the spread plate method. The live/dead dyeing method showed similar
results (Figure 2C,D).
Furthermore, we diluted the treated E. coli (Figure 2E) and S. aureus (Figure 2F) with broth to 1:100 and found that the optical density
(OD) 600 nm value, which indicated the surviving bacteria activity,
remained steady for 6 h compared with the significant increase with
time of the control group. All of the tests demonstrated that 20 ng/mL
BD2 could effectively inhibit both Gram-negative and Gram-positive
bacteria activity.

Figure 1 Antibacterial ability of BD2 demonstrated with a concentration
gradient against E. coli and S. aureus. To detect the antibacterial activity of
BD2 against E. coli and S. aureus, different BD2 concentrations in the same
volume of phosphate-buffered saline were mixed with 107 colony-forming units (CFUs) E. coli or S. aureus at 37 °C for 6
h. (A) Gross performance of different BD2 concentrations against 107 CFU E. coli or S. aureus. (B) Live/dead staining results of different
BD2 concentrations against 107 CFU E. coli or S. aureus. Both results showed
that the minimum effective antibacterial BD2 concentration is 20 ng/mL.
The white scale bar indicates 100 μm.

plates at 37 °C overnight. Gross antibacterial activity of BD2

(ANOVA). All statistical significance is shown in comparison with
the control group, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.

Regarding the antibacterial activity of BD2,
the results of Soman et al. in Anas platyrhynchos using avian BD234 suggested that BD2
has the ability to kill E. coli, but
they did not consider the antibacterial effect against S. aureus, which together with E.
coli are the most common bacteria in bone defect wound
and the main bacterial pathogens of human osteomyelitis. In our study,
we found that the MIC of BD2 against S. aureus was less than for E. coli, as similarly
reported earlier.35 Furthermore, the MIC
of BD2 was much lower at 20 ng/mL in the present study by 3 orders
of magnitude compared with the earlier reported MIC of 32–128
μg/mL.36 One reason that we achieved
similar antimicrobial effects with a lower MIC may be the ABP’s
dynamical behavior to the phospholipid membrane at a low concentration
as reported earlier.37 Another probable
reason is the different origin of the BD2 and bacteria. Application
of the low effective BD2 concentration would bring economic savings
and greater efficiency of the BD2 application.

Biological safety
is a precondition of clinical application. Warnke et al. reported
that the proliferation of human MSCs and osteoblasts was similarly
unaffected when incubated with recombinant human BD2.38 In our study, we confirmed that BD2 had no cytotoxicity
for rBMSCs according to the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) results.

We investigated the viability of rBMSCs treated with different BD2
concentrations using the CCK-8 assay. The cell cultures diluted with
10–80 ng/mL BD2 performed the same as the control group (Figure 3A,B), indicating
that BD2 did not inhibit cell proliferation of rBMSCs, such that we
could apply this concentration range safely to animals. Furthermore,
we investigated the mRNA levels of inflammation-associated cytokines
in the BD2 (20 ng/mL BD2) and control groups. We found that the cells
cultured in 20 ng/mL BD2 expressed 35–50% lower levels of tumor
necrosis factor-α (TNFα), caspase 3, and interleukin 6
(IL-6) compared with the control group, which indicated that BD2 can
effectively inhibit the expression of inflammatory cytokines in rBMSCs.

Figure 3 Effects of BD2 on cellular
proliferation and
cell inflammation of rat BMSCs. The rat BMSCs were cultured separately
in a control group of simple minimum Eagle’s medium α
(MEMα) and with different BD2 concentrations (10, 20, 40, 80
ng/mL). (A) Cellular viability was analyzed by the OD 450 nm value.
(B) Cellular viability was calculated based on equipercentile equating
and normalized to the control group. (C) TNFα, caspase 3, and
IL-6 mRNA expression levels of cells cultured in pure MEMα or
MEMα with 20 ng/mL BD2 for 3 days were analyzed by quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Data are presented as the mean ±
SD, n = 3, and P-values are calculated
using one-way ANOVA. All statistical significance is shown in comparison
with the control group, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.

Then, we detected a peripheral inflammatory response in rats after
implantation. We found that all of the treatment groups (PSeD/rBMSCs/BD2,
PSeD/rBMSCs, PSeD) and the control group showed similar behavior and
no specific inflammation reaction. Haemotoxylin and eosin (H&E)
staining (Figure 4A)
and immunofluorescent staining (Figure 4B,C) related to the expression of the M1/M2 macrophage
(CD68 for M1 and CD86 for M2) results suggested that the surrounding
soft tissue of all of the groups appeared to display a normal histological
structure and host response to the implants.

among the four groups. Scale bar for the first row in (A)–(C)
is 250 μm; scale bar for the second row in (A) is 25 μm.

Our study further
confirmed an osteogenic effect of BD2 in vitro. The data we reported
here indicated that BD2 could promote bone regeneration as well as
infection defense. It not only had bacteriostatic and bactericidal
effects in vitro but also promoted osteogenesis of rBMSCs via the
upregulated expression of related genes and proteins (collagen I (Col1),
osteocalcin (Ocn), osteopontin (Opn), runt-related transcription factor
2 (Runx2)). The osteogenic regulation by BD2 was correlated to concentration
within a certain range, reaching a peak effect at 20 ng/mL. Most of
the ABP-related studies indicated that with an increase of antimicrobial
peptide concentration, bacteria elimination and cell adhesion and
proliferation could be more effectively promoted.39,40 Similarly
in our study, an increase of BD2 concentration was associated with
more effective antimicrobial activity, as was its osteogenic effect.
However, when BD2 was >80 ng/mL, the osteogenic effect appeared
to be reduced. We suggest that because of the high BD2 concentration,
a signal was sent to an upstream receptor, which in turn suppressed
the expression and transmission of downstream signals. Nevertheless,
the specific mechanism needs to be discussed and explored in our future
research.

We evaluated the level of osteogenesis stimulated
by 20 ng/mL BD2 compared with the control group of the MEMα
culture medium alone. The results suggested that 20 ng/mL BD2 could
effectively promote osteogenesis of rBMSCs at the mRNA (Figure 5A) and protein levels (Figure 5B). Similar results
were obtained for the osteogenic differentiation for days 7 and 14
as reflected by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and alizarin red S (ARS)
staining, respectively, both through microscope observation (Figure 5C,E) and with the
naked eye (Figure 5D,F).

In the subsequent study, we chose 20 ng/mL when considering
the biological effect and economic factors. Furthermore, for the in
vivo experiments to correspond with the in vitro experiments, we calculated
the optimum amount of BD2 required per unit cell, which showed that
200 ng of BD2 was needed for 5 × 106 cells used in
each dorsum subcutaneous pouch as well as each rat critical calvaria
bone defect reconstruction.

For continual observation of bone
reconstruction, 1 and 8 weeks after generating the calvaria bone defect
and reconstructive surgery, the morphology of randomly selected rats
was reconstructed by living microcomputed tomography (micro-CT). During
the experimental observation, we found that two of six rats of the
control groups without BD2 adjunction had bacterial infection with
a purulent discharge from the wound and were dead 2 days postsurgery.
By contrast, among the groups with added BD2, there was no obvious
wound infection. The results of the tracing observation revealed that
the combination of PSeD/BMSCs/BD2 was superior to the others, with
the mean reconstruction area rates of the rest of the groups in the
order from PSeD/BMSCs to PSeD alone, being the least in the control
group (Figure 6A) in
the transverse section. This was also proved by the following morphometric
analysis of the bone volume/total volume (BV/TV), bone surface (BS),
and bone mineral density (BMD) (Figure 6D–F). At week 12, all of the skulls were dissected
and a three-dimensional isosurface generated. Moreover, the results
of van Gieson (Figure 6B) and Masson’s trichrome staining (Figure 6C) also corroborated the superiority of the
PSeD/BMSCs/BD2 combination. Furthermore, the luminograms and fluorochrome
analysis of tetracycline, calcein, and alizarin red indicated a similar
tendency for new bone formation (Figure 7A,B). In conclusion, BD2 was confirmed to
stimulate bone reconstruction in cooperation with a PSeD/BMSC scaffold.

results of reconstructed
skulls. To investigate the in vivo osteogenic effect, we continuously
traced the growth tendency of rat critical calvaria defects for 8
weeks. (A) Micro-CT images showing the difference in bone regeneration
among the control, PSeD, PSeD/BMSCs, and PSeD/BMSCs/BD2 groups at

applied the resin as the carrier to embed the skulls. Following embedding,
the skulls were stained with van Gieson dye. (B) van Gieson staining
results indicated that the PSeD/BMSCs/BD2 group performed the best
while the remaining three groups were ranked according to the order

the skulls were stained with Masson’s trichrome. (C) Masson’s

the same group. (B) The graph shows the percentages of the fluorochrome
area of new bone formation out of the whole bone area. With respect
to the different administration times, the new bone tissues were marked
in a different color at different stages of osteogenesis. The resulting
osteogenic area increased in the following order: control group, PSeD
group, PSeD/rBMSCs group, and PSeD/rBMSCs/BD2 group. Scale bar is
100 μm. All statistical significance is shown in comparison
with the control group, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.

Regarding an in vivo osteogenic effect, Yuan et al. demonstrated
that BD14 promoted effective osteointegration in rat femoral models
with or without infection while exerting a broad spectrum of antibacterial
effects.41 However, there were no similar
experiments focusing on BD2. In our in vivo study, we applied a PSeD/rBMSCs/BD2
scaffold as well as three comparator groups (PSeD/rBMSCs, PSeD, control)
to a critical-size calvaria bone defect model in rats. The results
suggested that the combination of PSeD/rBMSCs/BD2 could significantly
accelerate the process of bone reconstruction, while the other groups
displayed less new bone formation. The morphological analysis also
revealed that PSeD/rBMSCs/BD2 was superior to the other groups, including
by tetracycline, calcein, and Alizarin red fluorescence analysis and
by van Gieson and Masson’s trichrome staining.

Our experiments
confirmed the antimicrobial and osteogenic effects in vitro and in
vivo of BD2, while the specific mechanism remains to be investigated.

Conclusions
In summary, our study
suggested that BD2 could make antibacterial effects in a concentration-dependent
manner. The rBMSCs cultured with BD2 not only expressed higher levels
of osteogenic genes and proteins but also produced more osteogenesis-related
ALP and calcium precipitates in vitro. Moreover, BD2 combined with
rBMSCs and PSeD could effectively repair a rat critical calvaria defect,
suggesting this to be an innovative biodegradable composite with the
bifunction of antibiosis and osteogenesis. In conclusion, with its
antibacterial and osteogenic bifunctional effects, BD2 provides new
ideas for bone defect repair and appears promising for clinical application.

Experimental Section
Synthesis of PSeD
Initially, we mixed epoxy propyl
alcohol (7.8 mL, 116.9 mmol) and triethylamine (31.5 mL, 224.1 mmol)
in 180 mL of anhydrous toluene and precooled in an ethanol–water
mixture bath (−15 °C) for 30 min. Sebacoyl chloride (11.37
g, 47.6 mmol) was added to the precooled mixed solution under a nitrogen
gas atmosphere and was stirred and mixed well to stimulate an esterification
reaction and produce monomer diglycidyl sebacate. Following stirring
for 6 h, the mixture was filtered and concentrated. Silica gel was
prepared by mixing n-hexane and ethyl acetate in
a ratio of 3:1. Using the silica gel as the substrate, the mixed solution
was subjected to flash chromatography to obtain a white solid, namely,
diglycidyl sebacate.

The chief ingredients of PSeD were
sebacate glycidyl ester and sebacic acid, which performed the epoxy
ring-opening polymerization, that is, using tetrabutylammonium bromide
as a catalyst, ebacate glycidyl ester and sebacic acid dissolved in
dimethyl formamidine and then were diluted with ethyl acetate, precipitation
performed using ethyl ether, and vacuum-drying at room temperature
overnight, to ultimately generate PSeD.21

Cross-Linking of PSeD
PSeD
was mixed and melted with sebacic acid (1.1 wt %). This was heated
under high temperature at 120 °C for 20 h to remove air bubbles
and then placed in a vacuum-drying oven (1.1 Torr) at 120 °C
for 21 h for cross-linking. In addition, the in vitro material studies
also required two-dimensional cross-linking between PSeD and cell
slides to facilitate cell adhesion, proliferation, and observation.
We used a vacuum-drying oven to cross-link the PSeD materials under
a high temperature of 150 °C with 24-mm-diameter round coverslips.
The cross-linked materials were stored at room temperature and were
autoclaved before cell experiments. The porous three-dimensional scaffold
was constructed by salt fractionation with NaCl salt particles with
a uniform diameter of 75–150 μm.42

Antibacterial Tests
Antibacterial
tests were performed against Gram-negative E. coli (atcc29522) and Gram-positive S. aureus (atcc6538). First, 107 colony-forming units (CFUs) bacteria
were cultured in broth separately with different BD2 concentrations
(0, 10, 20, 40, 80 ng/mL). We selected the minimum initial concentration
of BD2 against both E. coli and S. anurans in
the spread plate and live/dead staining methods, and then, we compared
the BD2 group with the phosphate-buffered saline (control) group in
three different methods. Following coculture with 107 CFU
bacteria for 6 h, (1) 60 μL of fluid was inoculated in agar
plates and incubated at 37 °C overnight according to the method
reported earlier,43 (2) the bacteria after
experimental treatment were stained by life/death dyeing for 15 min
and the results were recorded by microscopic observation, (3) to monitor
the long-term inactivation efficiency of BD2 on bacteria, we diluted
the liquid culture with broth to 1:100, added it into 96-well plates,
and determined the OD 600 nm value every 30 min for 6 h; this procedure
was based on the protocol reported earlier.44

Cell Culture
Bone marrow
was extracted from the femur and tibia of 5-week-old male Sprague
Dawley rats, which were obtained from the Experimental Animal Room
of Shanghai Ninth People’s Hospital according to the protocol
of Reis and Borges,45 and all experimental
procedures were approved by the Animal Research Committee of Shanghai
Ninth People’s Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University School
of Medicine. The rBMSCs before the third generation were cultured
in minimum Eagle’s medium α (MEMα) (Gibco, Grand
Island, NY) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and 100 units/mL
penicillin at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2.
Recombinant rat BD2 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) was diluted to different
concentrations (10, 20, 40, 80 ng/mL) according to its biological
activity concentration range (0.1–100.0 ng/mL) in the MEMα
medium. After 24 h of cell attachment, rBMSCs were cultured in the
treated culture medium. In the treatment group, experimental cells
were cultured in MEMα with 40 ng/mL BD2, while in the control
group, the cells were in MEMα alone.

In Vitro Biotoxicity Detection
In total, 5 × 104 cells were seeded in 96-well plates in MEMα with different
BD2 concentrations (0, 10, 20, 40, 80 ng/mL). The CCK-8 reagent was
added to the BD2-containing MEMα and then incubated at 37 °C
for 4 h. Cell proliferation was quantified using a cell counting kit
(CCK-8) (Dojindo Chemical Laboratory, Kumamoto, Japan). The formazan
dye generated by the reaction between the reagent and live cells was
measured by spectrophotometry at 450 nm, and the cellular viability
was determined based on the control group set at 100%.

Cells
cultured in MEMα with or without 20 ng/mL BD2 were digested,
and the extracted mRNA was used to detect inflammation-related factors
(tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), caspase 3, interleukin-6
(IL-6)) by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qPCR), the method of which
is described in detail below.

In Vitro
Osteogenic Detection
qPCR Analysis
Total RNA was harvested from rBMSCs cultured in different BD2 concentrations
for 3 days using the EZ-press RNA purification kit (EZBioscience,
Shanghai, China), and complementary DNA (cDNA) reverse transcription
was performed using the PrimeScript RT reagent kit (Takara, Dalian,
China). The qPCR analysis was performed using Power SYBR Green PCR
Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and a 7500 Real-Time
PCR detection system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham). The primer
sequences used, including for collagen I (Col1), osteocalcin (Ocn),
osteopontin (Opn), runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), and
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), were reported earlier.46 The relative mRNA levels measured were normalized
to the GAPDH expression level.

Western
Blot Analysis
After culturing rBMSCs in different BD2 concentrations
for 7 days, the protein was extracted from the cells using radioimmunoprecipitation
assay (RIPA) buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Boston) and loading
buffer (Takara, Ostu, Shiga, Japan). The protein was separated by
12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
gel and transferred to 0.22 μm poly(vinylidene fluoride) membranes
(Millipore, Billerica, MA). The membranes were blocked in 5% bovine
serum albumin and tagged with primary antibodies diluted to 1:100
for Col1, Opn, Ocn, Runx2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz),
or β-actin (Abcam) for 8 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, the membranes
were probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies
(Sigma, Darmstadt, Germany) and scanned with an odyssey V3.0 image
scanner (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). The gray level of the immuno-labeled
bands was normalized to β-actin.

Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) and Alizarin Red S (ARS) Staining
Following the culture of rBMSCs in different BD2 concentrations
for 7 days, the cells were fixed in 95% ethanol and stained with ALP
staining solution for 2 h according to the protocol reported earlier.47 Staining with ARS solution was performed as
previously reported48 overnight on day
14.

Preparation for in Vivo
Experiments
We prepared 8-mm-diameter PSeD materials and
sterilized them using an autoclave sterilizer and then placed them
in a 24-well plate using sterilized tweezers. From the in vitro experiments,
an adequate BD2 concentration for antibacterial and osteogenic effects
was defined as 20 ng/mL; this was used to culture rBMSCs in six-well
plates (2.5 × 106 rBMSCs/2 mL/well). For each 8-mm-diameter
bone defect as well as subcutaneous biocompatibility detection unit,
the cell load of the scaffold was approximately 12.5 × 106, and the required amount of antimicrobial peptides for each
8-mm-diameter scaffold was 20 ng; because the diluted concentration
of the original antimicrobial peptides was 625 ng/mL, 30 μL
of this was added to each scaffold.

In Vivo Biocompatibility Detection
Six 8-week-old female
Sprague Dawley rats were used for this study. Four different dorsum
subcutaneous pouches were created through a single incision, and each
rat was implanted with three different disk-shaped materials, including
PSeD combined with BD2 (200 ng) and rBMSCs (5 × 106 cells), PSeD combined with rBMSCs (5 × 106 cells),
and PSeD alone, and one blank group as the control. The animals were
euthanized by general anesthesia, and the implanted materials were
harvested with the surrounding soft tissue via subcutaneous dissection
and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The samples were cut into 8 μm
sections, and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and macrophage-related
immunofluorescent staining (CD68 for M1, CD86 for M2) were performed
according to a standard protocol to detect the peripheral inflammatory
response after implantation of the materials.

In Vivo Osteogenic Detection
Animal Experiments
All experimental procedures were performed
following animal protocols approved by Animal Research Committee of
Shanghai Ninth People’s Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University
School of Medicine. Animals were raised in the Animal Center of Shanghai
JiaoTong University School of Medicine Affiliated Ninth People’s
Hospital.

The calvarium of twelve 8-week-old female Sprague
Dawley rats was shaved, cleansed with 75% ethanol, and exposed under
general anesthesia according to the method reported earlier.48 A critical-size round bone defect (8 mm diameter)
was created using a dental trephine (8 mm external diameter) (Nouvag
AG, Goldach, Switzerland). The implants were divided into four groups:
(1) PSeD scaffold seeded with rBMSCs (5 × 106 cells)
and BD2 (200 ng) (PSeD/rBMSCs/BD2), (2) PSeD scaffold seeded with
rBMSCs (5 × 106 cells) (PSeD/rBMSCs), (3) PSeD scaffold
(PSeD), and (4) blank group (control). The 12 rats were randomly assigned
to the four groups (n = 3). Following implantation,
the surgical incision was sutured layer by layer and finally disinfected
in 75% ethanol. At weeks 3, 6, and 9, tetracycline (Sigma, 25 mg/kg),
calcein (Sigma, 20 mg/kg), and alizarin red (Sigma, 30 mg/kg) were
injected via the abdomen, respectively, for fluorescent labeling according
to the protocol reported previously.18

Microcomputed Tomography (Micro-CT)
Analysis
At week 1 and week 8 after surgery, the rats were
administered general anesthesia and a circular region of interest
of 8 mm diameter defined as the original bone defect was examined
by micro-CT (Bruker SkyScan1076, Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) referring
to the parameters used previously,48 including
an X-ray tube potential of 40 kV, tube current of 250 μA, and
voxel resolution of 35 mm. The skull was a three-dimensional isosurface
rendered by software (MicroView, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI).

Fluorescence and Morphological Analyses
After 12 weeks of treatment, the rats were euthanized under general
anesthesia and decapitated. The skulls were dissected and fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in poly(methyl methacrylate), and dehydrated
in an increasing concentration of ethyl alcohol (70–100%).
Finally, the embedded skulls were cut into 300 μm sagittal sections
using a microtome (EXAKT310, EXAKT Technologies, Norderstedt, Germany).
We took pictures using a confocal microscope (Nikon A2, Nikon, Tokyo,
Japan) of the sections to detect the fluorescence intensity of tetracycline,
calcein, and alizarin red. Following van Gieson staining, we took
pictures of the gross image of the sections and measured the area
of the fluorochrome-stained bone using Image-Pro 5.0 (Media Cybernetic,
Silver Springs). The remaining skulls not already cut were decalcified
for 1 month and stained with Masson’s trichrome, taking pictures
of the sections.

Statistical
Analysis
All of the data are presented as the mean ±
standard deviation (SD). The analysis was performed using one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) and paired t-test through
SPSS, Version 22.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). A P-value
< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
