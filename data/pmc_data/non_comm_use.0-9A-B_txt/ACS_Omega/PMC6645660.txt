Gadolinium (Gd0) and uranium (U0) nanoparticles
are prepared via lithium naphthalenide ([LiNaph])-driven reduction
in tetrahydrofuran (THF) using GdCl3 and UCl4, respectively, as low-cost starting materials. The as-prepared Gd0 and U0 suspensions are colloidally stable and
contain metal nanoparticles with diameters of 2.5 ± 0.7 nm (Gd0) and 2.0 ± 0.5 nm (U0). Whereas THF suspensions
are chemically stable under inert conditions (Ar and vacuum), nanoparticulate
powder samples show high reactivity in contact with, for example,
oxygen, moisture, alcohols, or halogens. Such small and highly reactive
Gd0 and U0 nanoparticles are first prepared
via a dependable liquid-phase synthesis and stand as representatives
for further nanosized lanthanides and actinides.

Introduction
The access to metal
nanoparticles is the more challenging the lower
the electrochemical potential of the metal, and the smaller the size
of the particles.1 Both—strong base
character and small size—result in a tremendous increase of
the nanoparticle reactivity. In this context, iron is an illustrative
example: whereas the corrosion of bulk iron occurs on a timescale
of several months and years, nanosized iron is pyrophoric and shows
immediate ignition in contact with air.2 This enormous increase in reactivity is related to the significantly
higher surface area and the absence of any passivation layer.1 In terms of standard electrode potential, however,
bulk iron (E0bulk(Fe0/Fe3+) = −0.81
V) still has a moderate base character.3 The realization of nanosized lanthanide and actinide metals is another
magnitude of challenge that is addressed here with gadolinium (E0bulk(Gd0/Gd3+) = −2.28 V)3 and uranium (E0bulk(U0/U4+) = −2.23
V)3 nanoparticles as representative examples.
Although the standard electrode potentials (taken for alkaline conditions)
account for high oxygen affinity and high chemical reactivity of gadolinium
and uranium, they only refer to the bulk metals. Nanosized Gd0 and U0 are of course much more reactive as implied
by the standard electrode potential of the bulk metals.

Nanoparticles
of highly reactive base metals are yet most often
made via gas-phase techniques or by the decomposition of elaborate
metal–organic precursors, partially involving harsh and less
reproducible conditions.4−6 In view of Gd0 and
U0, only few publications are available and involve evaporation
methods, γ-ray irradiation, and pulsed laser ablation.7−9 These methods only result in nonuniform, heavily aggregated, and
partially oxidized particles. In this concern, it needs to be noted
that the most nanoparticles designated “gadolinium”
or “gadolinium-based” contain only Gd3+ (e.g.,
Gd2O3).10−14 The only option for the liquid-phase synthesis of Gd0 nanoparticles dates back to Tsai and Dye and the use of crown ether-stabilized
alkalides as powerful reducing agents.15 This strategy was developed further by Wagner et al., who studied
the magnetic properties in detail.16 Via
electron microscopy, however, they could only identify 10–15
nm sized Gd2O3 nanoparticles. Recently, they
also prepared Gd@Au core–shell nanoparticles comprising a dense
gold shell to protect the Gd0 core from oxidation.17 In regard to U0—to the best
of our knowledge—not any liquid-phase synthesis of nanoparticles
has been reported yet.

Taken together, straightforward liquid-phase
synthesis of Gd0 and U0 nanoparticles is lacking.
Dependable and
comparably simple synthesis is even more relevant because Gd0 and U0 stand as representatives for further lanthanide
and actinide metals. Owing to this concern, we present here the synthesis
of Gd0 and U0 nanoparticles with diameters <5
nm as colloidally stable suspensions in tetrahydrofuran (THF) or toluene.

Results
and Discussion
General Aspects
Several requirements
are essential
for preparing high-quality nanoparticles of highly reactive base metals
such as lanthanide and actinide metals. First of all, a powerful reducing
agent is essentially required. Here, hydrogen and hydrides (e.g.,
[BH4]− and [BEt3H]−) as well as elemental metals (e.g., Na0 and Mg0) have been suggested.18 Aiming at metals
with a standard electrode potential below −2.0 V, however,
hydrides are not powerful enough. Elemental metals, on the other
hand, are difficult to handle and need to be dissolved, for instance,
in liquid ammonia.19 Alkaline metal naphthalenides
represent an alternative option that was already widely used for establishing
main-group element–element bonding,20,21 as so-called activated Rieke metals in alternative to Grignard reagents
in organic synthesis,22,23 or for obtaining main-group-element
nanoparticles such as boron and silicon.24−26 In view of
nanosized transition metals (e.g., Ti0, Mo0,
W0, Re0, Fe0, and Zn0),
we also have good experience with lithium and sodium naphthalenides
([LiNaph] and [NaNaph]).27,28

In fact, [MNaph]
(M: Li and Na) is ideal for the synthesis of nanoparticles because
the injection of a homogenously dissolved reducing agent is optimal
for controlling particle nucleation and particle growth. Hence, the
high reducing power causes very fast formation of the elemental metal,
which is insoluble in THF. Consequently, high oversaturation occurs,
which—in accordance with the model given by LaMer and Dinegar29—results in very small particles. Moreover,
the deep green [MNaph] solutions are chemically stable for weeks (under
argon) and easy to portion with a syringe (in contrast to solid sodium
metal), and they can be handled at ambient pressure and temperature
(in contrast to liquid ammonia) (Figure 1). Finally, the concentration and the reducing
power of the intensely colored [MNaph] solutions can be easily determined
via the Lambert–Beer law.

Figure 1 Scheme illustrating the synthesis of Gd0 nanoparticles
including purification and realization of magnetic powder samples
as well as of long-term stable octylamine-modified suspensions.

Beside the reducing agent, the
use of low-cost metal chlorides
(i.e., GdCl3 and UCl4) as the starting materials
and of THF as a standard solvent are specific benefits of the synthesis
approach applied here (Figure 1). Thus, elaborate precursors (e.g., carbonyls and organometallic
compounds) that need advanced multistep preparation are not needed.
All in all, straightforward synthesis of Gd0 and U0 nanoparticles as well as of other nanosized lanthanide and
actinide metals can be highly relevant in view of their properties,
including magnetism (e.g., Sm–Co magnets),30 catalysis (e.g., Pt5Ln),31 superconductivity (e.g., heavy fermion actinide- and lanthanide-based
materials),32 metallic glasses (Ce–Al
alloys),33 or nanodispersed nuclear fuels.34−36

Gd0 Nanoparticles
Gd0 nanoparticles
were made via the [LiNaph]-driven reduction of GdCl3 in
THF. The immediate formation of a deep black suspension upon the addition
of the greenish [LiNaph] into the colorless GdCl3 solution
indicates the formation of Gd0 nanoparticles (Figure 1). Subsequent to
the reaction, side products were removed by repeated centrifugation
and redispersion. Thus, LiCl was removed via dissolution in THF; naphthalene
was removed by dissolution in toluene (Figure 1). After careful purification, the as-prepared
Gd0 nanoparticles can be either dried in vacuum to obtain
blackish powder samples or, in alternative, suspended in THF or toluene
to obtain suspensions that are colloidally stable for several hours
(i.e., not showing agglomeration and/or sedimentation). For long-term
stabilization, a certain amount of octylamine can be added (i.e.,
38 mL of toluene with 2 mL of octylamine). Such alkylamines (especially
oleylamine) are well-known stabilizers for all kinds of metal nanoparticles.37 In difference to the literature, however, alkylamines
are not required here to control the particle nucleation and only
optionally added after the formation of the nanoparticles.

Particle
size and particle size distribution of the as-prepared Gd0 nanoparticles were evaluated by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) (Figure 2). Overview
images show uniform nonagglomerated nanoparticles with a narrow size
distribution (Figure 2a,b). Statistical evaluation of 100 nanoparticles results in a mean
diameter of 2.5 ± 0.7 nm. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) confirms
the uniform spherical shape of the Gd0 nanoparticles (Figure 2c). Moreover, HRTEM indicates the
crystallinity of the as-prepared nanoparticles and clearly shows lattice
fringes. Fast Fourier transformation (FFT) analysis of the nanoparticle
ensembles confirms an excellent coincidence with the diffraction pattern
of hexagonal bulk Gd0 (lattice parameters: a = 3.62 and c = 5.82 Å) (Figure 2d).38 Single particles
are monocrystalline, as demonstrated by the FFT analysis of a particle
on the HRTEM image (Figure 2e), which is also in good agreement with the calculated diffraction
pattern of hexagonal bulk Gd0 (space group: P63/mmc) in the [210] zone axis (Figure 2f).

the as-prepared Gd0 nanoparticles:

evaluation of ≥100 nanoparticles on TEM images, (c) HRTEM image,

particle, and (f) FFT analysis of the red marked area with calculated
diffraction pattern of hexagonal bulk Gd0 (a = 3.62 and c = 5.82 Å in the [210] zone axis;
ZB indicates the zero-order beam).

Because of the high reactivity of the Gd0 nanoparticles,
not only the chemical synthesis but also the sample handling (e.g.,
purification procedure, centrifugation, and transfer into the electron
microscope) and all analytical characterizations require strict inert
conditions and the exclusion of all traces of oxygen and moisture.
Thus, the transfer of samples into the electron microscope needs to
be performed via suitable vacuum and inert gas transfer modules (see
the Supporting Information). Here, it turned
out as essential that the resting time of the sample grid with the
deposited Gd0 nanoparticles in the transfer module is as
short as possible (<30 min) to avoid oxygen contamination and formation
of Gd2O3 (Supporting Information: Figure S1).

The high reactivity of the as-prepared Gd0 nanoparticles
can be demonstrated by two illustrative examples. On the one hand,
they even react with the carbon layer of the Lacey carbon copper grid
under high-energy-electron bombardment in the electron microscope.
On the other hand, octylamine-stabilized nanoparticles that were centrifuged
and sintered as powder samples (900 °C) in vacuum, according
to X-ray powder diffraction, show reaction to GdN, with octylamine
being the only available nitrogen source (Supporting Information: Figure S2). The absence of impurities such as
Gd2O3, GdCl3, or LiCl, moreover,
confirms the purity of the as-prepared nanoparticles.

U0 Nanoparticles
U0 nanoparticles
were prepared similarly to Gd0 via [LiNaph]-driven reduction
of UCl4 in THF. Side products of the reaction were again
removed by repeated centrifugation in THF (i.e., removal of LiCl)
and toluene (i.e., removal of naphthalene). The as-prepared U0 nanoparticles were either dried to blackish powder samples
or redispersed in THF or toluene and result in colloidally highly
stable suspensions upon the addition of a certain amount of octylamine.
According to TEM analysis, the as-prepared U0 nanoparticles
exhibit a facetted shape and a narrow size distribution with an average
particle diameter of 2.0 ± 0.5 nm (Figure 3a,b). The similar size of Gd0 and
U0 can be attributed to the very fast reduction that results
in a high supersaturation of insoluble elemental metal in THF. This
situation—according to the LaMer model—favors very fast
nucleation and the formation of small particles.29

evaluation of ≥100 nanoparticles on TEM images, (c) HRTEM image,
(d) FFT analysis of a particle ensemble, (e) HRTEM image of a single
particle, and (f) FFT analysis of the red marked area with calculated
diffraction pattern of orthorhombic bulk α-U0 (a = 2.85, b = 5.87, and c = 4.96 Å along the [001] zone axis; ZB indicates the zero-order
beam).

The as-prepared U0 nanoparticles
also turned out as
crystalline. Thus, HRTEM indicates lattice fringes (Figure 3c,e), and the FFT analysis
of the nanoparticle ensembles shows excellent coincidence with the
diffraction pattern of orthorhombic bulk α-U0 (lattice
parameters: a = 2.85, b = 5.87,
and c = 4.96 Å) (Figure 3d).39 Single particles
are monocrystalline as demonstrated by the good agreement between
the FFT of the particle on the HRTEM image (Figure 3e) and the calculated diffraction pattern
of bulk orthorhombic α-U0 (space group: Cmcm) in the [001] zone axis (Figure 3f).

To illustrate the high reactivity of the
as-prepared U0 nanoparticles, we have evaluated several
reactions. Whereas the
dark black suspensions of the U0 nanoparticles in toluene
are chemically highly stable under argon, decolorization under the
formation of brownish UO2 suspensions occurred in the presence
of air on a timescale of few minutes (Figure 4). Powder samples of the U0 nanoparticles
react with air, humidity, and acids (e.g., aqueous hydrochloric acid)
as well as neat bromine or iodine under immediate ignition. In a more
controlled manner, iodine was slowly added to the THF suspensions
of the U0 nanoparticles to form bluish solutions, from
which dark blue single crystals were obtained after 2–3 days.
Lattice parameter determinations of these single crystals proved their
identity as UI3 × 4THF.40 This reaction also confirms the reactivity of the as-prepared U0 nanoparticles.

Conclusions
Gadolinium (Gd0) and uranium
(U0) nanoparticles
are prepared via lithium naphthalenide ([LiNaph])-driven reduction
of GdCl3 and UCl4, respectively, in THF. Because
of the powerful reducing agent, particle nucleation and particle size
are well-controlled, which results in uniform nanoparticles with a
narrow size distribution with average diameters of 2.5 ± 0.7
nm (Gd0) and 2.0 ± 0.5 nm (U0). Specific
surface-active agents are not needed to control the particle size.
Such a liquid-phase synthesis is shown here for the first time. U0 nanoparticles are made via the liquid phase for the first
time in general. Subsequent to suitable purification, the Gd0 and U0 nanoparticles are available as powder samples,
suspensions in THF or toluene, or long-term-stabilized suspensions
upon the addition of octylamine. The nanoparticles are chemically
stable in suspension under inert conditions. However, they are highly
reactive in the presence of oxygen and moisture of other oxidizing
agents, where they react with immediate ignition.

The straightforward,
highly dependable liquid-phase synthesis of
Gd0 and U0 nanoparticles offers an access to
all additional lanthanide and actinide metal nanoparticles. Using
THF as the solvent and simple metal chlorides (i.e., GdCl3 and UCl4) as the starting materials is an additional
benefit of the synthesis strategy. Beside fundamental research and
establishing a new, reliable liquid-phase synthesis strategy for Gd0 and U0, the synthesis of further nanosized lanthanide/actinide
metals as well as their use as reactive intermediates for obtaining
nanosized lanthanide/actinide compounds (e.g., alloys, intermetallics,
sulfides, and nitrides) can become highly relevant. This also includes
a bunch of material properties ranging from magnetism, catalysis,
and superconductivity to nuclear applications.

Experimental Section
Starting
Materials
THF (99%, Seulberger) and toluene
(99%, Seulberger) were refluxed and freshly distilled from sodium
and benzophenone. Octylamine (Aldrich, 99%) was refluxed and distilled
in a first step from CaH2 and thereafter, in a second step,
from NaH and degassed by three freeze–pump–thaw cycles.
Gadolinium(III) chloride (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), lithium (99%, Alfa
Aesar), and naphthalene (99%, Alfa Aesar) were used as received. Highly
pure single-crystalline uranium(IV) chloride was prepared according
to the literature by the chemical transport of UCl4 prepared
in situ from UO2 and AlCl3.41

Lithium naphthalenide ([LiNaph]) was prepared by
dissolving 28 mg of Li (4.0 mmol) and 600 mg of naphthalene (4.7 mmol)
in 10 mL of THF over a period of 24 h.

Synthesis of Gd0 Nanoparticles
Gadolinium(III)
chloride (703 mg, 2.67 mmol) was dissolved in 20 mL of THF. Thereafter,
a solution containing 56 mg of lithium (8.0 mmol) and 1200 mg of naphthalene
(9.4 mmol) in 20 mL of THF was added with vigorous stirring. The formation
of the Gd0 nanoparticles can be followed by the naked eye
based on the immediate change from a colorless solution to a dark
black suspension. The Gd0 nanoparticles were separated
by centrifugation and washed twice by redispersion and centrifugation
in/from 20 mL of THF and once in/from toluene. Finally, the nanoparticles
were centrifuged and dried in vacuum to obtain powder samples. In
alternative, the Gd0 nanoparticles can be redispersed in
38 mL of THF and 2 mL of octylamine to obtain long-term-stabilized
suspensions.

Synthesis of U0 Nanoparticles
U0 nanoparticles were prepared similarly to the Gd0 nanoparticles.
Accordingly, 380 mg of UCl4 (1.0 mmol) was dissolved in
15 mL of THF. Thereafter, a solution containing 28 mg of lithium (4.0
mmol) and 600 mg of naphthalene (4.7 mmol) in 10 mL of THF was injected
with vigorous stirring. Again, a deep black suspension was obtained
immediately. Separation, washing, and formation of powder samples
and suspensions were performed as described above.

Sample Handling
Because of the sensitivity and reactivity
of the as-prepared Gd0 and U0 nanoparticles,
strict sample handling with inert conditions (i.e., Ar and vacuum)
is required, ranging from synthesis to sample transfer and all analytical
studies (see the Supporting Information).

Safety Advice
Although the as-prepared Gd0 and U0 nanoparticles are chemically highly stable in
THF or toluene suspensions under inert conditions (Ar), they are highly
reactive in the presence of all kinds of oxidizing agents including
air, humidity, halogens, and acids. Even alcohols (e.g., hexanol and
octanol) lead to heavy evolution of hydrogen. Powder samples are highly
pyrophoric and can cause immediate ignition.

Working with radioactive
materials may demand special radiation protection depending on your
local legislation.
