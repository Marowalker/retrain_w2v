In
this study, we report a synthetically simple donor–acceptor (D–A)-type organic solid-state
emitter 1 that displays unique fluorescence switching
under mechanical stimuli. Orange and yellow emissive crystals of 1 (1O, 1Y) exhibit an unusual “back
and forth” fluorescence response to mechanical force. Gentle
crushing (mild pressure) of the orange or yellow emissive crystal
results in hypsochromic shift to cyan emissive fragments (λem = 498–501 nm) with a large wavelength shift Δλem = −71 to −96 nm, while further grinding results
in bathochromic swing to green emissive powder λem = 540–550 nm, Δλem = +40 to 58 nm.
Single-crystal X-ray diffraction study reveals that molecules are
packed by weak interactions, such as C–H···π,
C–H···N, and C–H···F,
which facilitate intermolecular charge transfer in the crystal. With
the aid of structural, spectroscopic, and morphological studies, we
established the interplay between intermolecular and intramolecular
charge-transfer interaction that is responsible for this elusive mechanochromic
luminescence. Moreover, we have also demonstrated the application
of this organic material for chlorine gas sensing in solid state.

Introduction
In recent years, solid-state
photoluminescent (PL) materials have
attracted considerable research interest due to their wide range of
applications in optoelectronics,1−6 memory devices,7,8 solid-state lasers,8−11 security markers,12−15 and biomarkers.16−18 Specifically, the emitters that can switch their
luminescence in response to external stimuli, such as heat, moisture,
mechanical pressure, solvent vapor, or any specific gas, are of special
interest for developing smart sensors and switches.19−31 Mechanochromic luminescence (MCL) is a phenomenon where the change
in photoluminescence is triggered by anisotropic or isotropic mechanical
stress. A number of organic or inorganic materials that display MCL
behavior have been reported so far.32−37 To mention a few, Ito and co-workers reported a number of gold–isocyanide
complexes that exhibited mechanochromic luminescence upon grinding.38−40 Park and co-workers reported several cyano-styryl-based derivatives,
which showed multistimuli-responsive luminescence in the solid state.41,42 Recently, Weder and co-workers have reported several polymeric systems
that displayed unique mechanochromic luminescence behavior.43−46 Although materials that exhibit bathochromic luminescence shift
upon mechanical grinding are very common, the examples of hypsochromic
shift are rather limited.47−51 Herein, we report a synthetically simple charge-transfer material
((Z)-2-(3,5-difluorophenyl)-3-(4-(diphenylamino)phenyl)acrylonitrile,
molecular compound is denoted as 1, Scheme 1) composed of diphenylamine
(DPA) donor and −F and −CN groups as acceptor that displays
a unique multistage mechanochromic luminescence. Upon application
of mechanical pressure, crystal forms of 1 show initial
hypsochromic PL shift, followed by bathochromic PL shift. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first example of purely organic material
that shows such “back and forth” wavelength switching
under mechanical stimuli. In addition to mechanofluorochromism, the
same material also exhibits thermo-/vapochromic fluorescence. With
the aid of detailed spectroscopic and structural study, we demonstrate
here the interplay between intermolecular charge-transfer interaction
and intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) interaction during the course
of mechanochromic fluorescence switching. Moreover, we have demonstrated
the application of this material in gas sensing. Both crystal and
ground powder are capable of detecting chlorine gas (evolved from
commercial bleaching powder upon addition of small amount of water)
by changing its fluorescence intensity. Although there are few examples
of inorganic- and composite-based solid-state chlorine gas sensors,52−55 reports of purely organic-based chlorine gas sensors are rare. According
to our literature study, porphyrin-based film is the only example
of organic material that showed chlorine gas-sensing property.56

Scheme 1 Synthetic Scheme of 1 and Crystallization
Route for 1O and 1Y
Compared to this report, our solid-state approach is much
simpler,
easy to synthesize the compound in pure form, and thus cost-effective.
More importantly, it is a single molecular component material that
exhibits tunable solid-state emission, multistimuli responsivity,
and gas-sensing property. Such material could have potential application
in smart optoelectronics and sensing devices.

Results and Discussion
Compound 1 was synthesized by one-step Knoevenagel
condensation reaction between 4-(diphenylamino)benzaldehyde and 3,5-difluorobenzyl
cyanide in 80% yield (Scheme 1). Recrystallization of 1 from different solvents
produced distinctly fluorescent forms. Yellow emissive crystals (1Y) were obtained from dimethyl sulfoxide solution, whereas
orange emissive crystals (1O) were obtained from acetone
solution (Scheme 1).

As-obtained product 1 was characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy, 13C NMR spectroscopy, and high-resolution
mass spectrometry (HRMS) (Figures S1–S3, Supporting Information (SI)). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, Figures S4 and S5, SI) showed that the crystals are stable up to 200
°C and have melting point in the range of 125–127 °C.
UV–vis spectra of 1 (in CHCl3, 1 ×
10–5 M) showed two absorption bands, one at λmax = 298 nm and a broad band in the 340–490 nm range
with λmax = 410 nm (Figure 1a). Comparing the absorption band of the
individual components and the product, the 410 nm band can be assigned
as intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) absorption involving the interaction
between donor diphenylamine group and acceptor −CN/–F
group of 1. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation
reveals that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is located
on donor diphenylamine group, whereas lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO) is centered on −CN/–F acceptor, in line
with the above observation (Figure 1b). Fluorescence spectra (in CHCl3, 1 ×
10–5 M, λex = 410 nm) exhibited
a broad green emissive band starting from 450 to 700 nm with λem,max = 534 nm with a Stokes shift of 5663 cm–1 (Figure 1a). This
band is attributed to intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT, 1CT → S0 transition) fluorescence. As expected for
ICT compound, solvatochromic fluorescence shift was observed for 1 (Figure S6, SI).57,58 Indeed, our DFT calculation reveals smaller HOMO–LUMO gap
in polar solvent compared to nonpolar solvent (Figure S7, SI), supporting the above observation.

Figure 1 (a) Solution-state
UV–vis, fluorescence, and excitation
spectra of 1 (CHCl3 1 × 10–5 M solution); (b) DFT-calculated HOMO and LUMO orbitals of 1; (c) UV–vis, fluorescence, and excitation spectra
of 1 drop-cast thin film (from CHCl3 1 ×
10–3 M solution); and (d) solid-state absorption
spectra of small crystals of 1Y and 1O.

Next, we have carried out solid-state
spectra of 1 drop-cast thin film and in crystalline state.
Compared to the solution
spectra, the charge-transfer band in drop-cast film (CHCl3 solution, 1 × 10–3 M, Figure 1c) slightly red-shifted (∼10 nm) and
became broader, suggesting the decrease in the HOMO–LUMO gap
in film state. Fluorescence spectra of the thin film displayed a green
emission band at 540 nm, which is assigned for ICT, 1CT
→ S0 transition. Similar to thin film, the UV–vis
spectra of the crystals of 1Y, 1O exhibit
a broad charge-transfer band in the range of 322–550 nm (Figure 1d).

Solid-state
fluorescence spectra of pristine 1Y crystal
displays an emission band at λem,max = 572 nm, whereas
pristine 1O crystal shows emission band at 595 nm (Figure 2c,d, yellow and orange
lines, respectively). Quantum yields (QYs) of the crystals are much
higher compared to those in solution of 1, indicating
the crystallization-induced emission enhancement behavior of this
compound. As listed in Table S1, the absolute
quantum yields of 1Y and 1O crystals are
0.34 and 0.30, respectively, but 0.017 in chloroform solution (with
reference to fluorescein dye). This could be credited to intermolecular
interactions in densely packed media that prevent nonradiative loss
of excited energy and increase the quantum yield in solid state. The
red-shifted luminescence of 1Y and 1O crystals
(compared to solution) is expected to be contributed from an excited
state governed by intermolecular interactions. Accordingly, fluorescence
excitation spectra of both the crystals, 1Y and 1O (by monitoring the emission at 572 and 595 nm, respectively),
exhibit a band at 515 nm (1Y) and 529 nm (1O), which can be attributed to intermolecular charge-transfer interaction
in ordered crystalline state (Figure S8a, SI). Moreover, excitation wavelength-dependent emission studies
of 1O also substantiate the claim that intermolecular
interaction in crystalline state is responsible for bathochromic shift
of fluorescence band. As the excitation wavelength increases from
460 to 523 nm, the emission gradually red-shifted (Figure S8b,c, SI).59 Similarly,
the excitation maximum at ∼500 nm, which corresponds to intermolecular
interaction, gradually red-shifted with increasing the monitoring
wavelength (Figure S8d). All of these observations
validate the presence of intermolecular charge-transfer interaction
in the crystalline state. In addition to the crystals, the PL color
of 1 can also be tuned by simply embedding in a different
polymer matrix (5 wt % of 1 from dimethylformamide (DMF)
solution of the polymer) having different functional groups (Figure S9, SI). Variation of the fluorescence
color was observed depending on the intermolecular interaction between
the molecules of 1 and the functional groups of the polymer
matrix.

mechanochromic luminescence. (a) 1Y crystal and (b) 1O crystal. The stepwise color changes are given in subpanels
(a1–a4) and (b1–b4). (c) Fluorescence spectra for 1Y in different stages of grinding with reference to (a1–a4).
(d) Fluorescence spectra for 1O crystals with reference
to (b1–b4).

Interestingly, the crystals
of 1Y and 1O display a unique multistage
mechanochromic response that exhibits
“back and forth” PL wavelength switching. With gradual
increase of mechanical pressure (careful hand grinding by mortar and
pestle), both the pristine crystals show initial hypsochromic PL shift,
followed by bathochromic PL shift. Specifically, gentle crushing of
the pristine 1Y crystal (a1 and a2, Figure 2a) and 1O crystal
(b1 and b2, Figure 2b) triggers the formation of cyan emissive form with prominent rise
of the emission peak at 501 nm (for 1Y, Δλem = −71 nm) or 499 nm (for 1O, Δλem = −96 nm) (Figure 2c,d). Further increase of grinding pressure leads to
the green emissive film having emission band at λem,max = 542 nm for 1Y-ground film (a3 and a4, Figure 2a) and 555 nm for 1O-ground film (b2–b4, Figure 2b). Experimental powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) plot
of 1O-ground powder and 1Y-ground powder
shows similar pattern with small difference in peak position (Figure S10, SI). This suggests that grinding
of both the crystals leads to green emissive forms that have similar
molecular arrangements and electronic interactions. To the best of
our knowledge, 1O or 1Y is the first example
of a purely organic material that shows such unique mechanochromic
luminescence behavior. Moreover, large blue-shifted mechanochromic
luminescence (with overall Δλem = +(40–58
nm)) is another important feature of our system. It is important to
note that, compared to red-shifted mechanofluorochromism in solid
organic materials, the examples of blue-shifted ones are rather very
limited.47−51

To obtain a deeper insight into the structure function correlation,
we have carried out single-crystal X-ray diffraction of the luminescent
crystals. Orange emissive form 1O crystallizes in triclinic
system with centrosymmetric P1̅ space group
(Figure 3 and Table S2, SI), consisting of three molecules
in asymmetric unit. Out of three, two molecules lie parallel in a
slip-stacked fashion having a longitudinal slipping angle of 46.07°
and a distance of 5.295 Å (between two acceptor phenyl planes).
The other molecule in the asymmetric unit lies antiparallel. Packing
diagram reveals that the molecules are connected by hydrogen-bonding
interactions involving aromatic protons and F or N atom of the neighboring
molecules (C46–H46···F5, D–A distance
= 3.238(3) Å; C26–H26···F4, distance =
3.399(3) Å; and C15–H15···N6, distance
= 3.259(4) Å). In addition to these interactions, several C–H···π
interactions (H to centroid distances of 2.770 and 2.865 Å) were
also observed that connect the molecules in different crystallographic
directions (Figures 3b,c, S11, S12, and Table S3, SI). These
interactions provide rigidity to the molecule in packed solid state
and reduce the nonradiative decay that enhance fluorescence quantum
yield (QY) in crystal (compared to solution).60−62 Notably, π–π
interactions were not observed in the crystal structure possibly because
of the bulkiness and nonplanar orientation of triphenyl moiety that
restrict closure vicinity of the molecules.35,60,61,63 This is another
reason for QY enhancement of 1 in the solid state (Table S1, SI), since π–π interaction
is known to impart detrimental effect on fluorescence intensity. Our
repeated attempts to obtain good X-ray-quality crystals of yellow
emissive and green emissive form were unsuccessful. A comparative
look at the PXRD plots reveals that the majority of the peaks in 1O-ground form has slightly higher 2θ values than others,
indicating relatively denser packing in pristine 1O crystal,
which favors stronger intermolecular interactions that facilitate
bathochromic shift of fluorescence emission (Figure S12b).

red and green, respectively. (b, c) C–H···π
interactions along different crystallographic directions.

To elucidate the mechanism of distinct mechanochromic
luminescence
of 1Y and 1O crystals, we have carried out
IR, Raman, PXRD, and fluorescence emission/excitation analyses at
different stages of grinding. We hypothesized that multistage mechanochromism
could arise from the pressure-induced rotational dynamics of phenyl
groups that lead to conformational change of the molecule and affect
the intermolecular charge-transfer interaction (Table S4, SI). Infrared spectra of 1O crystal, 1O-gently crushed, and 1O-hard ground green emissive
film showed distinct features of aromatic C–H bond frequency
(stretching, in-plane, and out-of-plane vibrations; Figures 4a,b and S13, SI). This suggests that the symmetry and conformation
of the molecules have changed during the course of grinding. Particularly,
the blue shift of out-of-plane bending frequency at 698 cm–1 (Figure 4a) and in-plane
bending frequency at 1270 cm–1 (Figure S13b) indicates that grinding leads to weakening of
the intermolecular interactions involving aromatic C–H bonds.
The upshift of C≡N stretching frequency upon grinding suggests
the strengthening of C≡N bond and weakening of intermolecular
interaction involving this group (Figure S13d, SI). Moreover, the slight blue shift of aromatic C–F bond
stretching frequency indicates that intermolecular hydrogen-bonding
interactions involving C–F···H moiety become
weaker in ground state (Figures 4b, S14a, and Table S3, SI).
Such weakening of intermolecular interaction in solid state would
result in the loss of crystallinity and long-range order. In fact,
PXRD of the hard ground green emissive powder of 1O exhibits
broader reflection peaks compared to the simulated one (obtained from
single-crystal 1O, Figure 4c), which also supports the above statement.

Figure 4 (a) Comparative
IR spectra (attenuated total reflection) of pristine 1O crystal, gently crushed, and hard ground powder. (b) Changes
in aromatic C–F stretching frequency modes. The color legends
shown in (a) apply for (b) as well. (c) Overlay PXRD pattern of experimental
(hard ground powder) and simulated (from single crystal) 1O. Simulated patterns were obtained from the crystal structure using
Mercury software version 3.7. (d) Fluorescence excitation spectra
at different stages of grinding of 1O crystal.

Furthermore, as observed from Figure 4d, fluorescence excitation
spectra of the 1O crystal, 1O-gently crushed,
and 1O-hard ground film are different, suggesting the
involvement of distinct
electronic states that are responsible for emission switching. Specifically,
upon increasing the grinding pressure, the intermolecular interaction
band at λmax = 529 and 515 nm disappeared along with
blue shift of the ICT band. This intermolecular interaction band in
the ca. 500–550 nm region is not present in the absorption
spectra of 1O-hard ground film, in line with the above
observation (Figure S14b, SI). In contrast
to 1O crystal, the excitation wavelength-dependent emission
spectra of 1O-hard ground film do not display red shift
of the emission band upon increasing the excitation wavelength (Figure S14c, SI). All of these results justify
that grinding leads to the loss of long-range intermolecular interaction.
The excitation spectra of 1Y crystal also reflect the
same trend (as in case of 1O), suggesting similar change
in electronic states at different stages of grinding (Figure S14d, SI). Fluorescence lifetime study
at different stages of the grinding reveals that lifetime decreases
upon gentle crushing to metastable cyan emitting state and again slightly
increases for hard ground green emissive film, which is more stable
(Table S5 and Figure S15, SI).

On
the basis of all of these experimental observations, we suggest
a mechanistic model of unique mechanochromic luminescence of 1O and 1Y crystals (Figure 5). The yellow or orange emission of the crystal
is dominated by long-range order that facilitate intermolecular charge-transfer
interactions. Application of gentle pressure (on 001 face, as observed
from BDFH analysis and molecular arrangement; Figure S16, SI) changes molecular orientation by reconfiguration
of weak intermolecular interactions. This leads to a sterically congested
metastable state, where nonradiative decay is restricted and thus
exhibits hypsochromically shifted cyan emission. Further increase
of grinding pressure (hard ground green emissive film) leads to randomization
of molecules and diminution of long-range order, where monomeric ICT
green emission is prevalent.

Figure 5 Possible mechanism of supramolecular rearrangement
of D–A
molecules (shown as red-green bicolor rods) at different stages of
grinding. Luminescence color at each stage is also shown.

Next, we have tested the morphology-dependent emission
behavior
of 1 in crystalline and amorphous states. 1 drop-cast from DMF solution (1 × 10–3 M)
produced well-shaped microcrystalline architecture (Figure 6a), which emits yellow fluorescence.
When drop-cast from methanol (1 × 10–3 M),
it formed green fluorescent beadlike particles with average dimension
of 500–800 nm radius and 200–300 nm height, along with
some small crystallites (Figure 6b–d). As observed by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), some interconnected
beads were also formed. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED)
image confirmed that green fluorescent beads are amorphous in nature
(Figure 6f). Moreover,
fluorescence microscopy reveals that amorphous beads are green emissive
and small crystallites are yellow emissive (Figure 6d). This suggests that green emission is
contributed by monomeric ICT interaction, where molecules are randomly
oriented without having strong intermolecular interactions. On the
contrary, long-range order in crystalline state facilitates intermolecular
charge-transfer interaction, which results in red-shifted emission.
This observation is in accordance with our proposed mechanism for
mechanochromic luminescence.

casting from DMF solution. (b, c) SEM and atomic force microscopy

solution. (d) Fluorescence microscopy image of drop-cast (from methanol)
solid; amorphous beads show green fluorescence and crystallites show
yellow fluorescence. (e) TEM image of beads and (f) selected area
electron diffraction (SAED) image of the bead particles.

The unique mechanochromic behavior of 1Y and 1O crystals motivated us to explore their response
to other
stimuli, such as solvent vapors or heat. A general schematic diagram
of multistimuli-responsive behavior is depicted in Figure 7. Interestingly, compound 1 exhibits pronounced vapochromic and thermochromic fluorescence
switching (Figures S17–S21, SI).
When 1Y-ground film (green emissive, λmax = 540 nm) was exposed to ethyl acetate vapor or benzene vapor, it
showed notable vapochromic swing to cyan emission (λmax = 498 nm, Figure S17, SI). A similar
phenomenon was also observed for 1O-ground film, however,
much weaker in response (Figure S18, SI).
In contrast to the ground film, the pristine crystals do not show
such vapochromic response, possibly because of the compact packing
of the molecules. Void space calculation on the crystal structure
of 1O reveals no accessible void space that can accommodate
solvent molecules. However, in the ground film state, molecules are
more disordered, loosely packed, and spaced. TGA of vapor-exposed
ground sample did not show any solvent loss, which discards the possibility
of solvent trapping. Thus, possible mechanism of vapochromic response
can be explained in terms of vapor-induced rearrangement of molecules.
The interaction of solvent vapor with the disordered molecules of 1Y-ground film allows them to relax to a different type of
packing.

Figure 7 Multistimuli (pressure-, vapo-, thermo-) responsive behavior and
possible changes in the molecular arrangement in 1O and 1Y crystal/powder.

The effect of thermal stimuli on these solid emitters was
studied
by TGA, DSC, and hot-stage fluorescence microscopy (Figures S4, S5, and S19–S21, SI). Heating of all of
the crystals 1Y and 1O to melt state leads
to the loss of fluorescence and crystallinity. However, upon cooling
to room temperature (RT), the solidified material showed very weak
green emission (λmax =548 nm). PXRD study confirmed
that these melt-solidified materials are amorphous (Figure S20c and S21b). Interestingly, upon exposure to acetone
vapor at room temperature, amorphous melt compound (1Y-melt or 1O-melt, Figures S20 and S21, SI) regains its crystallinity with slight shift in fluorescence
wavelength to greenish yellow. At the initial stage of crystallization/nucleation
(red-shaded region in Figure S20d, SI),
the PL intensity is decreased, but recovered its moderate intensity
after exposing to air for 3–10 min of crystallization.

The promising vaporesponsive property of 1Y and 1O in solid state prompted us to utilize them as a sensor
for harmful gases like chlorine. Exposure of solid crystals of 1Y to chlorine gas (from commercially available bleaching
powder with addition of small amount of water) leads to significant
increase in PL intensity (Figure 8a). 1Y crystal showed 11-fold increase
in intensity when exposed to chlorine gas released from 20 mg of bleaching
powder (35%). Not only crystal but also the ground and drop-cast films
(from chloroform solution) act as sensor for chlorine gas (Figure 8b,c). The sensing
of ground or drop-casted film is not fully reversible. Keeping the
material in air for 30 min or heating at 50 °C for 10 min leads
to the decrease in PL intensity, but does not return to its original
emission intensity. This irreversibility was also observed from 1H NMR study (discussed later).

from bleaching powder and water) sensing

before and after exposure. Bleaching powder is abbreviated as BP in
the figure panels. (b, c) Same for 1Y-ground film and 1 drop-cast film (from chloroform solution). (d) 1Y-ground film with approximately 1.7 ppm (in air) chlorine concentration.

To test the efficiency of the
sensing, we have carried out few
experiments using different amounts of bleaching powder in constant
air volume of 1 L (Figure 8d).a1Y-ground film exhibited
a slight increase in PL intensity when exposed to low concentration
of chlorine gas, suggesting the strong sensing ability of the same.
The response is dependent on the concentration of chlorine gas. As
shown in Figure S22 (SI), the PL intensity
gradually increases with increasing the chlorine gas concentration
from 5 to 10 ppm.

To elucidate the mechanism of chlorine gas
sensing, we have carried
out few experiments before and after chlorine gas exposure. The changes
observed from PXRD and IR spectroscopy (Figures S23 and S24, SI) suggest the negligible change in supramolecular
rearrangement. Interestingly, similar to solid-state behavior, the
solution of 1 (in CHCl3) when purged with
chlorine gas also showed increase in fluorescence intensity with a
slight shift in wavelength. This suggests possible charge-transfer
interaction between 1 and chlorine, although the possibility
of chemical reaction cannot be ruled out. 1H NMR spectra
at different stages of chlorine gas purging showed prominent change
in the 7.10–6.70 ppm region with the rise of several triplet
peaks, suggesting o-chlorination of DPA ring (Figure S26). This change is irreversible even after heating
the solution at 50 °C for 10 min or keeping the solution at RT
for 48 h. Mass spectra showed a peak at 478.206, which corresponds
to dichlorinated product of 1 (Figure S27, SI). On the basis of all of the above observations, we
believe that the initial increase in fluorescence intensity is due
to donor–acceptor-type interaction of 1 with chlorine
gas, which diminishes after certain time when chlorination of the
DPA moiety starts. Precise study with pure chlorine gas tank equipped
with ppm-level sensor is out of our reach and beyond the scope of
this study. However, details of solid-state sensing experiments and
its mechanistic process are currently under investigation in our lab
and will be part of future study.

Conclusions
In
summary, we have developed a synthetically simple molecular
material that exhibits unique mechanochromic luminescence, i.e., “back
and forth” wavelength switching at different stages of mechanical
grinding. The interplay between intermolecular charge transfer facilitated
by long-range order in crystal and intramolecular charge-transfer
interaction in powder is responsible for such fluorescence switching.
We have also developed a mechanistic model that successfully explains
this unusual mechanofluorochromism. Moreover, we have demonstrated
that the same material can be used as a solid-state sensor for harmful
chlorine gas. Unlike multistep synthesis and tedious purification
process, this material was obtained in pure form by one-step reaction,
followed by recrystallization, and thus poses advantage in terms of
cost effectiveness and practical usability. Such concept design of
molecule can be exploited further to develop new materials having
distinct optical property that can be used for sensory and optoelectronic
application.

using tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminum. The absolute quantum yield
was calculated using the method reported previously.65 Fluorescence image were captured using a Leica DM 2500P
microscope equipped with Linkam THMS600 hot stage.

Fluorescence
Lifetime
Fluorescence lifetime measurements
were performed on a Leica TCS SP8 instrument.

IR Spectra
Infrared spectra were recorded on a SHIMADZU
IR Prestige-21 spectrometer using KBr as matrix.

Raman Spectra
The crystals and ground film were recorded
using a WiTec α-300R Confocal Raman microscope.

DSC and
TGA
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
measurements were carried out on a TA Instruments DSC Q2000 model
with a Peltier cooling system with a heating and cooling rate of 10
°C/min under nitrogen atmosphere. Thermogravimetric analyses
(TGA) were performed on a TA Instruments SDT Q600 V20.9 Build 20,
with a heating rate of 10 °C/min using nitrogen (50 mL/min) as
purging gas.

SEM and TEM
Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images
were obtained from JEOL-JSM5610 instrument using 8–10 kV energy.
Samples were prepared by drop casting from methanol or DMF solution
on silicon wafers and dried at ambient temperature. The samples were
coated with gold prior to the SEM study. Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) measurements were performed on an FEI Tecnai T30 system with
EDAX microscope at an accelerating voltage of 300 kV. The samples
were prepared by drop casting from methanol solution of 1 on a carbon-coated copper grid. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements
were carried out with Bruker NanoScope instrument with a nominal tip
(Veeco RTESP tips, 1–10 Ω/cm), phosphorus doped Si was
used as cantilevers at the resonant frequency range of 266–326
kHz. Scan arrays were 256 × 256 points, and the scan rate was
0.62 Hz.

PXRD
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD)
was measured by
a XEUSS SAXS/WAXS system by Xenocs, operated at 50 kV and 0.60 mA.
The X-ray radiation was collimated with FOX2D mirror and two pairs
of scatterless slits from Xenocs. The data were collected in the transmission
mode geometry using Cu Kα radiation (wavelength λ = 1.54
Å). The fiber diagrams were recorded using an image plate system
(mar345 detector) and processed using FIT2D software.

Single-Crystal
X-ray Diffraction
The data of 1O crystal were
collected on a Bruker APEX-II CCD diffractometer
at 298 K using graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ
= 0.71069 Å). Data reduction was carried out with SAINT software
and analyzed for agreement using XPREP.66 Absorption correction was carried out with the SADABS program.67 The structure was determined by the method included
in SHELXT program of the APEX software suite and refined using SHELXL-2014.68−71 The nonhydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Details of crystallographic
parameters are given in Table S2, Supporting
Information. The crystallographic data have been deposited with the
Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre under references 1564351 (1O).

Computational Methods
All of the
theoretical calculations
were carried out using the Gaussian 098 program suite. Density functional
theory (DFT) with hybrid B3LYP functionals72−74 and the 6-31G(d)
basis sets were used for gas-phase geometry optimization of compound 1 using coordinates from crystal structure (1O) as input. Tomasi’s polarizable continuum model (PCM)75 was used for describing the solvent effect on
the HOMO–LUMO gap of the compound. All of the output structures
were visualized by Chemcraft software.

Synthetic Procedure
A 100 mL round-bottom flask equipped
with a magnetic stirrer and reflux condenser was charged with 4-(diphenylamino)benzaldehyde
(0.238 g, 0.87 mmol) and 3,5-difluorobenzyl cyanide (0.1 mL, 0.87
mmol) in 30 mL of methanol solution. Potassium tert-butoxide (0.112 g, 1.0 mmol) and tetrabutyl ammonium hydroxide (25%
methanol solution, 1 mL, 1.0 mmol) were added to the flask, and the
resulting mixture was heated at 80 °C for 5 h. The product mixture
was cooled and kept for crystallization for 3 days. Yellow crystalline
product was obtained from mother liquor, which was isolated by filtration
(0.285 g, 80%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ

a Considering
that commercial bleaching
powder have 35% active chlorine, we can approximately estimate the
concentration of chlorine gas (in ppm) that is released upon addition
of small amount of water. For example, if 1 mL of water was added
to 5 mg of bleaching powder that is kept inside a 1 L bottle (Figure
8d),
then we can assume that the concentration of released chlorine gas
that occupies 1 L volume is 1.7 ppm (1.75 mg of active chlorine gas
per 1 L air volume). Considering that chlorine gas is heavier than
air, the actual concentration at the top of the bottle might be lower
than 1.7 ppm.
