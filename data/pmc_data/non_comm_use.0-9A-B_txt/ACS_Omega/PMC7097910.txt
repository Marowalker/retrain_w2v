The promising photovoltaic solar
cells based on the perovskite
light-harvesting materials have attracted researchers with their outstanding
power conversion efficiencies (over 23% certified). The perovskite
work has geared up in just under a decade and is competing with well-established
semiconductor technologies such as silicon (Si), copper indium gallium
selenide (CIGS), and cadmium telluride (CdTe). To commercialize the
perovskite solar cells, their stability is the major concern. To address
the stability issue, several factors need to be taken into account,
and one of them is developing stable hole transport materials (HTMs),
which are the essential building blocks. In this mini-review, we will
discuss the important features of the HTMs, such as design and development
of phenothiazine-based HTMs. Since phenothiazine is a low cost and
stable molecule compared to the spiro-OMeTAD, it can be modified further
via molecular engineering.

Introduction
Due
to the growth of the population and the increasing desire for
a comfortable life, the demand for energy is very high. The present
source of energy is based on fossil fuels. Considering the scarcity
of fossil fuels, researchers are working toward renewable energy sources
which are clean and green. In this regard, the contingent option for
sustainable development of human society is the conversion of sunlight
into electricity. The photovoltaic cell is efficient and a good candidate
as a renewable energy source.1,2 Among the various photovoltaic
technologies, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have gained more
attention from researchers by considering several properties like
cost-effectiveness, easy fabrication, eco-friendliness, better stability,
flexibility, and high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). A breakthrough
was made by O’Regan and Grätzel in 1991 with the PCE
of 7%. Soon after, it reached 13% PCE with a zinc porphyrin photosensitizer
and cobalt-based electrolyte system. The DSSC device is facing a stability
problem because of the liquid electrolyte system, which does not allow
for the commercialization and leads the research toward developing
solid-state DSSCs (ssDSSCs).3 The first
ssDSSCs with the heterojunction between the CuSCN and TiO2 were reported by the Tennakone group.4 However, all efforts yielded lower PCE; therefore, it is essential
to work toward the alternate materials and devices. The PCE of 2.56%
was achieved by Bach and Grätzel in 1988 with the spiro-OMeTAD
(2,2′-7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxy-phenyl-amine) 9,9′-spirobifluorene)
as a hole conductor and Ru(II)L2(SCN)2 (where
L is 4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridyl) as a light harvester
in ssDSSCs.5 However, the hole conductor
is suffering from the charge combination rate and pore-filling factor.
Some of the research groups address these drawbacks by minimizing
the thickness of TiO2. The PCEs of 3.8% and 6.5% were achieved
with the device with CH3NH3PbI3 as
the photosensitizer and iodide/triiodide (I/I3–)-based
liquid electrolyte by Miyasaka and Park’s group.6 Using similar perovskite materials and the different
hole conductor spiro-OMeTAD, in 2012 Kim’s group reported the
PCE of 9.7% with the Jsc of 17 mA/cm2, a VOC of 0.888 V, and a FF of
0.62. This was the first time the highest PCE with a spiro-OMeTAD-penetrated
mesoscopic TiO2 film based device was reported. Further,
the PCE was shown to reach up to 10.9% by Snaith et al. Then the perovskite
solar cells (PSCs) came into existence, where spiro-OMeTAD as a solid
hole-transporting material (HTM) and perovskite as the light-harvesting
material are used. It is noted that a huge enhancement in PCE is gained
within a decade (3.8% to 24.2%), which is competitive with the commercially
available silicon solar cells.7

The
PSCs have unique properties like better molar extinction coefficients,
good charge carrier mobility, tunable band gaps, and effective temperature
processability.8 Tremendous research is
being conducted for the advancement of perovskite light-harvesting
material and fabrication techniques in PSCs. Generally, the PSC device
architecture consists of the five components: transparent conductive
oxide layer (FTO conductive substrate), an electron-transporting layer
(n-type mesoporous semiconductor metal oxide), light-harvesting material
(perovskite), hole-transporting layer (spiro-OMeTAD), and metal electrode
(Au). The device architecture, different types of perovskite devices
(Figure 1a–d),
energy level diagram (e), energy levels of the existing HTMs (f),
and crystal structure (g) are shown in Figure 1.

architecture.

structure of perovskite solar cell.

To improve the performance of the devices, we have to enhance the
properties of the hole-transporting materials (HTMs). A lot of research
is being done on the active layer and hole-transport layer (HTL) to
produce stable PSCs for its commercialization.9 HTMs are crucial components for the PSCs to improve the PCE as well
as stability.10 To become the champion
HTMs, they should possess the following properties: better photochemical
and thermal stability, good alignment of the highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO) for facile hole transfer, and better hole mobility.
To date, spiro-OMeTAD is the champion HTM for the PSCs with the PCE
over 20%. However, its synthesis is tedious and costly, and hole mobility
is low (∼10–5 cm2 V–1 s–1), which inhibits poor device performance,
thereby limiting the scope of commercialization. To make PSCs a commercial
product in the market, many research groups are working on the HTMs,
which are essential for better stability and high PCE. Until now,
various organic HTMs are studied with the spirobifluorene cores, triphenylamine,
tetraphenyl, 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene, fluorene, carbazole, and
tetrathiafulvalene.11

Among them,
recently, phenothiazine (PTZ)-based HTMs came into
the picture for PSCs and were shown to be a good candidate for the
PSCs which have also shown good performance in DSSCs. Phenothiazine
is a well-known electron-rich heterocyclic compound inbuilt with the
heteroatom’s nitrogen and sulfur. It can produce a stable radical
cation with reversible oxidation and low potential.12 The phenothiazine exists in the butterfly confirmation,
which prevents molecular aggregation, and good hole-transport capability
encouraged their identity in the DSSCs,13 OLEDs, and OPVs.14 The optical properties
are also affected by the degree of disorder in phenothiazine film
and molecular aggregation.15,16 In this mini-review,
we have discussed the optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties
of phenothiazine-based small-molecule HTMs.

In 2018, the Wang
group reported three D–A–D HTMs
with a dithienopyrrolobenzothiadiazole (DTPBT) core with end group
triarylamine, a phenothiazine (PTZ), and alkoxy-triarylamine termed
as HZ1, HZ2, and HZ3, respectively (Figure 2). Among them, the HZ2 contains the donor
group phenothiazine, which shows the highest PCE of 14.2% with the Jsc of 20.43 mAcm–2, Voc of 1.026 V, and FF of 68%, and better stability
(over 280 h at a dehumidification wardrobe with 20% relative humidity
without encapsulation) compared to the HZ1 (7.0%), the HZ2 (10.2%),
and close to the state-of-the-art spiro-OMeTAD (14.9%). It is a well-known
fact that the phenothiazine moiety will be planar in geometry, which
is in favor of intermolecular stacking. The large π-conjugated
DTPBT/PTZ made a possible way to get better hole mobility and conductivity.
The HTM HZ2 was shown to have a little higher conductivity (3.20 ×
10–4 S cm–1) and hole mobility
(4.80 × 10–4 cm2 V–1 s–1) than the spiro-OMeTAD. The fill factor is
also responsible for the good photovoltaic performance, which was
influenced by the shunt resistance (Rsh) and series resistance (Rs). The observed Rsh was 2.08 kΩ cm2 for HZ2
which is higher than the HZ1 and HZ3 and resulted in the enhancement
of the short-circuit current of the HZ2. The HZ2 showed the Rs of 9.6 Ω cm2, which is smaller
than other devices HZ1 and HZ3. The nanosecond absorption spectroscopy
(ns-TAS) showed a τTAS value of 139 ns for the HZ2.
These values are a little less than the spiro-OMeTAD (τTAS of 148 ns).17

Grätzel et al. developed
three HTMs with PTZ moiety attached
by the double bonds with the end groups (4,4-dimethyltriphenylamine
(Z28), N-ethylcarbazole (Z29), and 4,4-dimethoxytriphenylamine
(Z30)) (Figure 3).
The HTMs were affordably synthesized in three simple steps including
electrophilic substitution followed by the Vilsmeier and Witting reactions.
All the HTMs showed intramolecular transitions (ICT) around 400–450
nm. The Z29 showed a blue shift compared to the Z28 and Z30, because
of the lower conjugation. The HOMO values of Z28, Z29, and Z30 are
−5.93 eV, −5.44 eV, and −5.27 eV, respectively,
which are higher than the double cation perovskite (−5.5 eV).
The LUMO values were found at −2.83 eV, −2.82 eV, and
−2.73 eV, respectively, and well-aligned with the double cation
LUMO level for smooth hole transfer.18

Figure 3 Molecular
structures of Z28, Z29, and Z30 (reproduced with permission
from ref (18)).

The hole mobility was measured using the space
charge limited current
(SCLC). The hole mobility of the Z28, Z29, and Z30 was found to be
6.18 × 10–5, 6.82 × 10–6, and 6.70 × 10–5 cm2 V–1 s–1, respectively. The highest PCE of 19.17% with
the Jsc of 23.53 mA cm–2, Voc of 1.114 V, and FF of 0.73% was
observed in Z30 compared to the Z28 PCE of 17.77% (Jsc of 23.01 mA cm–2, Voc of 1.087 V, and FF of 0.60%) and Z29 (Jsc of 22.35 mA cm–2, Voc of 1.114 V, and FF of 0.73%) (Figure 4). The Z28 showed lower PCE because of the
HOMO energy level, which was because the double cation perovskite
leads the insufficient driving force of hole injection and less hole
mobility. The overall conclusion was that the PCE was affected by
the conjugation of the molecular structures. The HTM Z30 containing
the highly conjugated 4,4-dimethoxytriphenylamine showed better PCE,
and Z28 consists of the less conjugated peripheral group (N-ethylcarbazole), leading to lower PCE. The same strategy
was followed in the stability studies also.

The research group of Roberto Grisorio synthesized two HTMs with
the PTZ core attached by the donor group’s diarylamine (PTZ1)
and triarylamine (PTZ2) (Figure 5). They concluded that the optical and photovoltaic
properties of the PSCs are mostly affected by the small variation
in the molecular design. The molecules were synthesized by the well-known
synthetic steps such as Buchwald–Hartwig and Suzuki–Miyaura
cross-couplings with the synthesis cost of PTZ1 (111.90 $/g) and PTZ2
(156.76 $/g), which are much less than that of spiro-OMeTAD (∼600
$/g).

The absorption maxima were found for PTZ1 at 282
nm with a shoulder
peak at the longer wavelength, and for PTZ2 it was observed at 308
and 332 nm. For PTZ1 and PTZ2, HOMO values were found at −4.77
and −5.15 eV, respectively, following the same conditions as
the spiro-OMeTAD, showing −5.02 eV. PTZ2 showed higher Voc due to the favorable oxidation potential.
The stability studies revealed that PTZ2 (359 °C) is more stable
compared to PTZ1 (416 °C) with the Tg of 74 and 135 °C (Figure 6). The PSC device of the double cation mixed halide
perovskite with PTZ1, PTZ2, and spiro-OMeTAD showed the Jsc of 4.2, 21.1, and 21.6 mA/cm2, a Voc of 0.82, 1.11, and 1.15 V, and FF of 0.61,
0.75, and 0.71 along with a PCE of 2.1%, 17.6%, and 17.7%, respectively.19

Salunke’s group
developed a similar molecular design of
PTZ2 and Z30 using low-cost two-phenothiazine-based HTMs (AZO-I and
AZO-II) functionalized with azomethine moieties (Figure 7). These HTMs are synthesized
via Schiff base chemistry which is an eco-friendly, simple Pd-free
synthetic route. The AZO-I and AZO-II are the least costly phenothiazine-based
HTMs to date (9 and 12 $/gram). The PTZ2 and Z30 were prepared by
the Pd-catalyzed Suzuki coupling and yielded 24.9% and 27.7%. In case
of the AZO-I and AZO-II, they are synthesized by the Pd-free synthetic
route with 51% and 40% yield, respectively. Due to the length of conjugation,
λmax was red-shifted in the DCM solvent (AZO-II:
453 nm, AZO-I: 422 nm). The HOMO values of the AZO-1, AZO-II, and
spiro-OMeTAD were −4.97, −4.94, and −4.80 eV,
respectively, which are well aligned with the mixed cation perovskite.
The stability studies revealed that the AZO-II is stable up to 405
°C with the Tg at 120 °C, and
AZO-I was up to 392 °C with the Tg at 85 °C. The higher Tg was found
in the AZO-II because of the high molecular weight and stiffness.
The HTM AZO-II showed higher hole mobility (2 × 10–6 cm2 V–1 s–1) compared
to the AZO-I (2 × 10–5 cm2 V–1 s–1) due to the two-electron-donating
triarylamine groups on the phenothiazine core.20

permission from ref (20)).

The PSC devices (ITO/SnO2/Cs0.05MA1–yFAyPbI3–xClx/HTM/Au) with the
HTMs AZO-I and AZO-II exhibited a PCE of 14.3% and 15.6%, with the Jsc of 20.1 mA cm–2 and 21.6
mA cm–2, Voc of 1.00
and 0.95 V, and FF of 0.66 and 0.71, respectively. In AZO-I, the interaction
with the perovskite was poor because the high hysteresis resulted
in a low PCE. In similar conditions, the champion HTM spiro-OMeTAD
showed a PCE of 19.3% with the Jsc of
23.4 mA cm–2, Voc of
1.04 V, and FF of 0.74 (Figure 8).

Recently, Cheng et al. developed two novel phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide
(PDO) based low-cost (62.1791 $/g and 61.2761 $/g) HTMs. In PDO1,
the PDO N-position with anisole and the PDO2 N-position with 4,4′-dimethoxytriphenylamine
and 4,4′-dimethoxydiphenylamine are the end groups (Figure 9). These are synthesized
by the Buchwald–Hartwig reaction followed by the radical substitution
and oxidation. The conversion of PTZ to PDO has resulted in a better
charge affinity of the moiety. The λmax was observed
at around 350 nm, and HOMO energy levels were calculated as −5.25
and −5.24 eV vs vacuum, for the PDO1 and PDO2, respectively,
revealing that the substitution at the N-site of the PDO moiety will
not be affected more on the optical properties.21

Figure 9 Molecular structures of the PDO1 and PDO2 (reproduced with permission
from ref (21)).

The PDO moiety was found as a twisted butterfly
and planar conformation
with the monoclinic space group C2/c and I2/a in PDO1 and PDO2, respectively.
The device was fabricated with the mixed cation and halide perovskite
(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 as the light-harvesting material and PDO1 and PDO2 as the HTMs under
simulated AM 1.5 G (100 MW cm–2). The observed Jsc of 22.6 mA·cm–2 and
23.9 mA·cm–2, Voc of 1.08 and 1.15 V, and FF of 68.3 and 73.6 with a PCE of 16.7%
and 20.2% for the PDO1 and PDO2, respectively. The hysteresis index
values were 0.025 and 0.016% observed from the scan of open circuit
(OC) to short circuit (SC) (Figure 10). Under the similar conditions the spiro-OMeTAD resulted
in a PCE of 19.8% with the Jsc of 24.2
mAcm–2, Voc of 1.14,
and FF of 71.1 and hysteresis index of 0.020%. The best efficiency
was observed for the PDO2, which has a planar structure of the PDO
core and good molecular stacking behavior. The successful molecular
engineering of the HTMs with the conversion of the electron-donating
sulfur atom to the electron-withdrawing sulfone group (from PTZ to
PDO) and N-substitution strongly influenced the electron affinity,
energy level alignment, photovoltaic properties, and the charge carrier
mobility.

Tsang’s group synthesized
the D−π–D
skeleton containing PTZ-based dopant-free HTMs (BDT-PTZ and BDT-POZ),
for p-i-n PSCs (Figure 11). The molecular design consists of the two donor moieties
connected through a fused thiophene core, which is responsible for
the better hole mobility and electron-donating ability. These are
prepared by the simple Suzuki coupling of the bromohexyl donor and
fused thiophene moieties. The λmax was noted at around
440 nm, and BDT-POZ was red-shifted compared to the BDT-PTZ in the
case of both the solution (chloroform) and solid phase. The HOMO and
LUMO values were calculated as −5.42 eV, −5.35 eV and
−2.81, −2.78 eV for BDT-PTZ and BDT-POZ, respectively,
which are well-matched with the MAPbI3 energy level.22

By using the SCLC method, the hole-based device (indium tin
oxide
(ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/HTM/MoO3/Ag) and the HTMs BDT-POZ, BDT-PTZ, and PTAA showed hole mobilities
of 2.1 × 10–4 cm2 V–1 s–1, 9.8 × 10–5 cm2 V–1 s–1, and 4.1 ×
10–5 cm2 V–1 s–1, respectively. The BDT-POZ showed nearly two-times
higher hole mobility compared to the BDT-PTZ and five times more than
the PTAA because of the smaller N–N distance between redox
centers and proper molecule packing. To know the hole extraction behaviors,
steady-state and transient photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded
for perovskites, BDT-POZ, BDT-PTZ, and bare glass. The strong steady
PL peak of MAPbI3 is clearly observed in the MAPbI3/glass, and when coming to the MAPbI3/BDT-PTZ,
the peak intensity was decreased compared to the MAPbI3/BDT-POZ, suggesting the best hole extraction efficiency compared
to the MAPbI3/BDT-PTZ. This is further confirmed by TRPL,
and the average PL lifetimes of 114.9, 42.1, and 25.8 ns were found
from MAPbI3/glass, MAPbI3/BDT-PTZ, and MAPbI3/BDT-POZ, respectively. The MAPbI3/BDT-POZ showed
less PL, due to the better charge carrier ability (Table 1). In order to know the suitability
of the HTM, the device architecture with the ITO/HTM(BDT-PTZ) and
BDT-POZ as dopant-free HTMs/MAPbI3/[6,6]-phenyl-C(61)-butyric
acid methyl ester/bathocuproine/Ag was fabricated. The inverted device
with 4 mg mL–1 of BDT-POZ resulted in a Jsc of 22.46 mA cm–2, a Voc of 0.96 V, FF of 84.4%, and overall PCE of
18.20%, and a concentration increase of up to 8 mg mL–1, the small increment of the Jsc from
22.46 to 22.56 mA cm–2, Voc from 0.96 to 1.04 V, and a slight decrease in FF from 84.4% to 81.7%
were observed. The p-i-n device with the optimized concentration and
dopant-free BDT-PTZ, BDT-POZ, and PTAA resulted in the Jsc of 22.43, 22.56, and 22.26 mA cm–2, Voc of 1.02, 1.04, and 1.08 V, FF of
79.8, 81.7, and 74.2%, and the overall PCE of 18.26, 19.16, and 17.85%,
respectively, under AM 1.5 G illumination with the small hysteresis
(Figure 12).

Robertson et al. reported triphenylbenzene
(TPB) core based HTMs,
1,3,5-tris(2′-((N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl))benzene
(TPB(2-MeOTAD)) and 1,3,5-tris(2′-(N-phenothiazoyl)phenyl)benzene
(TPB(2-TPTZ)) (Figure 13). First, they replaced the 4,4′-dimethoxydiphenylamine with
the PTZ unit. The synthesis involved a low cost two-step starting
material 1,3,5-tris(2-bromophenyl)-benzene that was prepared using
the aldol condensation and Buchwald–Hartwig coupling, resulting
in the final HTMs with notable yields (73% and 50%) and with the cost
of 12.98 $ g–1 and 3.09 $ g–1,
respectively. The manufacturing cost is less than the standard spiro-OMeTAD
(100 to 400 $ g–1). The absorption spectra were
recorded in the DCM solvent. The absorption maxima of the TPB(2-TPTZ)
were shifted 23 nm toward the red region (323 nm) compared to the
4,4′-dimethoxydiphenylamine-substituted TPB(2-MeOTAD). The
calculated HOMO values were −5.29 eV and −5.34 eV, respectively,
which are lower than the −5.44 eV (spiro-OMeTAD) and matched
with a perovskite (MAPbI3) valence bond for smooth hole
injection. The HTMs are stable up to around 120 °C, and Tg values of TPB(2-MeOTAD) and TPB(2-TPTZ) were
observed at 89 and 110 °C, respectively, and at 122 °C for
spiro-OMeTAD. In order to investigate the performance of SFX-MeOTAD
as a hole transport material in perovskite solar cells, the FTO/ZnO-Mg-EA(NH3+)/m-TiO2/MAPbI3/HTM were
fabricated and compared with spiro-OMeTAD.

Figure 13 Chemical structures
of HTMs (reproduced with permission from ref (23)).

The overall PCEs of TPB(2-MeOTAD) and TPB(2-TPTZ) were 12.14% and
4.32% with the Jsc of 19.32 and 8.89 mA
cm–2, Voc of 0.97 and
0.88 V, and the FF of 64.54% and 55.30%, respectively. The state-of-the-art
spiro-OMeTAD yielded a PCE of 18.04%. The TPB(2-TPTZ) showed lower
efficiency with higher stability. The stability studies were performed
using a dry and dark box, at 25 °C, and the relative humidity
was 30%. The initial PCEs of 85% (TPB(2-TPTZ)), 75% (TPB(2-MeOTAD)),
and 72% (spiro-OMeTAD) were retained over 300 h, respectively. The
faster degradation was observed in TPB(2-TPTZ) (85%), which consisted
of hydrophilic dimethoxy diphenylamine as a side chain and better
stability observed due to the hydrophobic nature of the phenothiazine.23

To reduce the cost of the HTMs, Robertson
developed a series of
spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene] SFX-based HTMs, SFX-TAD, SFX-TCz,
SFX-TPTZ, and SFX-MeOTAD (Figure 14). These HTMs were synthesized using the Buchwald–Hartwig
amination reaction between 2,2′,7,7′-tetrabromo-spiro(fluorene-9,9′-xanthene)
in very good yields of 71%, 56%, 35%, and 83%, respectively. The UV–visible
spectra were measured in the presence of the DCM solution. There were
two absorption bands observed at 307, 367, 307, 379, 291, and 340
nm, for the SFX-MeOTAD, SFX-TAD, and SFXTCz, while SFX-TPTZ showed
one broad absorption peak at λmax = 310 nm. From
the cyclic voltammetry studies, the HOMO value was determined as −5.34,
−5.70, and −5.39 eV for SFX-TAD, SFX-TCz, and SFX-TPTZ
and as −5.1 eV for SFX-MeOTAD, which was similar to the spiro-OMeTAD
(Figure 15). The lower
HOMO of the SFX-TAD and SFX-TPTZ resulted in the high Voc.24

The XRD study reveals
that all HTMs were well crystallized in monoclinic C2/c(SFX-TPTZ), triclinic space group P1–(SFX-MeOTAD), and orthorhombic Pbca(SFX-TCz). The three hydrogen bonds are formed in the
SFX-MeOTAD with lengths of 2.549 Å and 2.572 Å for OMe–OMe
and 2.522 Å for CHO (xanthenes). The dihedral angles 87.54°,
88.89°, and 87.57° were found between xanthenes and fluorene
moieties for SFX-MeOTAD, SFX-TPTZ, and SFX-TCz, which are similar
to spiro-OMeTAD (89.94°). The thermal study (differential scanning
calorimetry) data revealed that the Tg value was observed at 270 °C for SFX-TPTZ and SFXTCz and at
122 °C, 118 °C, and 108 °C for spiro-OMeTAD, SFX-TAD,
and SFX-MeOTAD, respectively.

To calculate the efficiency, the
device with glass/FTO/compact
TiO2/mesoporous Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3–xClx/HTM/Au and SFX-MeOTAD exhibited the PCE of 12.4%,
near the spiro-OMeTAD PCE of 13.0%, and showed higher Voc and less Jsc and FF compared
to others. The hole mobility of SFX-MeOTAD (1.6 × 10–5 S cm–1) was also similar to the spiro-OMeTAD (1.4
× 10–5 S cm–1), respectively.

Zhao’s group designed and developed the SFX core-based HTMs
termed as SFX-PT1 and SFX-PT2 along with the spiro-PT. The HTMs SFX-PT1
and SFX-PT2 were prepared by the Buchwald–Hartwig amination
in good to excellent yield (Figure 16). The λmax was found at around 321
nm for both SFX-PT1 and SFX-PT2, while spiro-PT showed 313 nm (Figure 17). The cyclic and
differential pulse voltammetry studies were recorded to know the HOMO
level of HTMs. The HOMO values were observed as −5.08 eV, −5.20
eV, and −5.33 eV for SFX-PT1, SFX-PT2, and spiro-PT, respectively.
Spiro-PT, SFX-PT1, and SFX-PT2 possess higher decomposition temperatures
(Td) and Tg of 324 °C, 435 °C, 421 °C, 110 °C, 153 °C,
and 148 °C, respectively. The hole mobilities of the SFX-PT1,
SFX-PT2, and spiro-PT are calculated as 2.08 × 10–3 cm2 V–1 S–1, 2.76
× 10–4 cm2 V–1 S–1, and 1.29 × 10–4 cm2 V–1 S–1, respectively.
The hole mobility of SFX-PT1 is more than the spiro-OMeTAD (2.0 ×
10–4 cm2 V–1 S–1).25 Optical and photovoltaic
parameters of mentioned HTMs are shown in Table 2.

Summary and Outlook
In this mini-review, we have summarized the research progress on
the PTZ-based HTMs. The HTMs are the crucial components to enhance
the PCE along with the stability. This review provided the basic idea
about the PSC device architecture and information about phenothiazine-based
HTMs. There is rapid growth happening in the perovskite solar cells;
therefore, there is a need to develop a highly stable device that
consists of a better perovskite layer and an efficient and cost-effective
electron/hole transport layers. Until now, the champion spiro-OMeTAD
is used as the HTM layer, which includes tedious synthesis and an
expensive process. Hence, researchers are looking toward the development
of less expensive new transport materials to promote the PSCs into
the commercial market. Simultaneously, the novel HTMs should be stable
and synthesized from sustainable sources of materials; tunable energy
levels with high mobility will provide efficient and stable PSCs.
In this scenario, PTZ-based HTMs came into existence because of the
favorable optoelectronic properties, cheap synthetic route, suitable
electron-donating nature, and better hole mobility. The PTZ is an
electron-rich hetero aromatic core, which leads to the production
of various HTMs with low-cost production. In this mini-review, we
conclude the importance of the PTZ moiety to improve the efficiency
as well as stability of the perovskite solar cell devices.
