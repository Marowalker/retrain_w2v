Gene
therapy is a developing method for the treatment of various
diseases. For this purpose, the search for nonviral methods has recently
accelerated to avoid toxic effects. A strong alternative method is
magnetofection, which involves the use of superparamagnetic iron oxide
nanoparticles (SPIONs) with a proper organic coating and external
magnetic field to enhance the localization of SPIONs at the target
site. In this study, a new magnetic actuation system consisting of
four rare-earth magnets on a rotary table was designed and manufactured
to obtain improved magnetofection. As a model, green fluorescent protein
DNA-bearing polyethyleneimine-coated SPIONs were used. Magnetofection
was tested on MCF7 cells. The system reduced the transfection time
(down to 1 h) of the standard polyethyleneimine transfection protocol.
As a result, we showed that the system could be effectively used for
gene transfer.

Introduction
Gene therapy is defined as insertion of
an exogenous gene into
cells to compensate for the abnormal gene or to make beneficial proteins,
for example, to affect the immune system or angiogenesis.1−6 The exogenous gene needs to be transported to the cell in vectors,
which are classified as viral and nonviral vectors. Commonly used
viral vectors are the adenovirus, lentivirus, and adeno-associated
viruses.7−9 While viral vectors are efficient carriers, they
pose potential risks. On the other hand, nonviral vectors emerged
as a safer alternative. Cationic lipids and polymers are commonly
used nonviral vectors.10 They are regarded
as suitable carriers for genes in the free form or in the form bound
to nanoparticles.11,12 Magnetic nanoparticles are strong
candidates for this task.13−15 Superparamagnetic iron oxide
nanoparticles are quite popular in magnetic resonance imaging for
diagnosis and also for drug/gene delivery as therapeutics for various
diseases because of their biocompatibility in addition to magnetic
properties.16−19

Transferring magnetic nanoparticle-bound genes into target
cells/tissues
using a magnetic field is called magnetofection.20−22 Such nanoparticles
are generally coated with cationic polymers for DNA binding. Then,
they interact with the cell membrane and are dispersed into the cytoplasm
through endosomal escape. In this case, the particles remain in cellular
vesicles and are taken up by endocytosis. After internalization by
the cells, DNA is released via a proton sponge effect.20,23,24 Polyethyleneimine (PEI) is the
conventional and well-established transfection agent. However, it
is known to be toxic, limiting the applicable dose.19,21 Binding PEI on magnetic nanoparticles and using a magnetic field
increase the transfection efficiency while reducing the toxicity.17,25

In our previous study, we showed that polyethyleneimine-coated
superparamagnetic nanoparticles (PEI-SPIONs) can efficiently transfer
green fluorescent protein encoding DNA (GFP-DNA) under varying magnetic
fields.26 In an 8 h magnetofection procedure,
viability improved, but the transfection efficiency was below the
standard PEI transfection method.

In this study, alterations,
which could be introduced to the standard
PEI transfection protocol, were investigated using MCF7 cells reported
as resistant to transfection.26 Accordingly,
the transfection time of 8 h was reduced to 1 h after inspecting transfection
efficiencies for 3 h. When the transfection efficiencies were examined,
we proved that efficient transfection could be performed even within
a short time (1 h) with the developed new generation actuation system.
Accordingly, GFP-DNA transfer to the MCF7 cell line with high efficiency
was achieved with magnetofection. The new actuation system was designed
for overcoming the toxicity effect of the standard PEI transfection
protocol with an improved efficiency. Hence, the feasibility for replacing
the standard PEI transfection protocol was investigated and presented.

Results
and Discussion
Actuation System
A varying magnetic
field was generated
by rotating the system consisting of four magnets on a plexiglass
table as shown in Figure 1. Each individual magnet had a magnetic field flux of 230
mT. The magnetic flux values of the system were utilized in the numerical
model with air as the ambient (Figure 2a). The system was modeled to prove the nonuniform
magnetic field distribution throughout the rotary table.

Merve Zuvin.)

Figure 2 Model of the study: (a)

general view of the mesh configuration, and (d) close-up view of the
mesh configuration

Simulations were performed
using a workstation of Intel Core i7-3630QM
CPU with a 2.40 GHz processor. The diameter and thickness of the magnets
were 2.5 cm and 0.5 cm, respectively (Figure 2b). The plexiglass table was 9 cm wide and
0.5 cm thick. An extremely fine free tetrahedral mesh configuration
(1151002 domain, 33178 boundary, and 1072 edge elements) was used
(Figure 2c,d). The
governing equations are as follows: 1   2   3  Here, H is the magnetic field
strength, B is the magnetic field, and A is magnetic vector potential (25). J is the current
(in our case, it is 0), E is the electric field (in
our case is 0), and σ is the electrical conductivity. The magnetic
field flux value of the magnet system was utilized in multiphysics
software COMSOL5.2a using a configuration of four magnets and a plexiglass
table for magnets.

According to the simulation results, the
maximum magnetic force
values are obtained at a distance of 2 cm from the rotary table (Figure 3a). Furthermore,
as the distance between the sample and the magnet system increases,
the magnetic force decreases. However, the fluxes exerted from magnets
are distributed in such a way that their magnetic forces move in a
circular pattern around the center of these four magnets. Thus, the
circulating effect initiates at the distance of 2.5 cm (Figure 3b), and it leads to neither
small forces at larger distances nor forces concentrated at shorter
distances. At the distances of 3 and 3.5 cm, less-concentrated magnetic
patterns are observed, and smaller forces are generated (Figure 3c–e). All
the magnetic flux density patterns regarding Figure 3a–e are combined to a single 3D illustration
(Figure 3f).

Figure 3 Simulation

the magnetic system: (a) The maximum magnetic force occurs at the
distance of 2 cm; (b) at the distance of 2.5 cm, distribution starts;
(c, d) a nonconcentrated magnetic force is observed at the distances
of 3 and 3.5 cm; (e) at the distance of 6 cm, magnetic fluxes are
combined into a circular pattern, and the magnetic force significantly
decreases. (f) The red line represents densities at the distances
of 2, 2.5, and 3 cm; orange and yellow ones correspond to the distances
of 5 and 6 cm, respectively; light and dark blue represent the lowest
magnetic flux density at every level.

Because of a strong magnetic field observed in the light
of the
findings of simulations, 2, 2.5, 3, and 3.5 cm distances are examined
for the cell experiments. The objective of the rotating system is
to allow as many nanoparticles as possible to enter into the cells,
which are attached to the plate.

The system generated a nonuniform
magnetic field with fluxes varying
from 2 to 60 mT through the rotary table, which were experimentally
measured. To visualize the effect of distance between the sample and
rotary table, iron dust particles were used. It can be observed that
iron dust particles are influenced by the magnets’ own fields
and aggregate on individual magnets as expected when the petri dish
containing iron dusts is placed on the magnets and cluster near the
edges (Figure 4a).
When the petri dish is slowly removed upward (from the table), the
magnets work together, and the dust particles are evenly distributed
in the plate (Figure 4b). Then, the effect of the rotation of the system on dusts is investigated.
Accordingly, when the behavior of dust particles at different distances
is examined, it can be seen that, for a 2.5 cm distance, dust particles
arrange successively, and the particles are continuously lifted from
one side and roll around the center (Figure 4c–f). In a permanent magnetic actuation
system, the particles experience a lifting force given as 4  where F is the lifting force
of a permanent magnet, μ0 is the magnetic permeability
4π × 10–7 N/A2 , M is the magnetization, μ0M is the
saturation magnetization, and A is the area of magnetization
(area of rotary table) [26]. In our system, the saturation magnetization
of a single magnet is 230 mT, while the generated lifting force is
971.26 kN. These results provide clues for particle motion under magnetic
field application in the system for cell experiments.

magnetic field, dusts begin to distribute throughout the plate when
the system is operational; (c) dusts align successively, (d) lift,
(e) roll, and change direction in their own axis and then (f) lift
again.

Cell Experiments
The cell experiments were carried
out with three different samples, namely, polyethyleneimine (PEI),
polyethyleneimine-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles
without a magnetic field (PS w/o mag), and polyethyleneimine-coated
superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles under rotary magnetic fields
(PS rot mag), and a single dose of 60 μg of PEI (both free and
bound). First, the effect of distances is investigated. Figure 5 illustrates the experimental
procedure steps.

Figure 5 Experimental procedure. Schematic representation of experimental
steps: (1) introducing the agents, (2) magnetic field exposure, (3)
during exposure, (4) removing agents after the procedure, and (5)
after expression.

In order to obtain a
uniform distribution, 2, 2.5, 3, and 3.5 cm
distances are explored based on the findings of numerical simulations.
After the experiments, the transfection efficiencies and cell viability
are examined (Figure 6). PEI and PS w/o mag (PEI-SPION without magnetic field exposure)
were used as control and treated in the same way as their counterparts.
PS rot mag indicates PEI-SPION exposed to rotary magnetic fields.

or PS (PEI-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION))
together with 10 μg of GFP-DNA and then exposed to a magnetic
field for 1 h. After incubation of cells at 37 °C for an additional
2 h, transfection solutions are removed by washing with PBS, and the
culture was maintained in fresh DMEM medium until incubation time
is achieved to 48 h. (a–f) GFP expression is observed by inverted
fluorescence microscopy at 48 h post-transfection. Scale bar: 100

in complete medium. Then, the absorbance of formazan solution is measured
by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. PEI and PS w/o mag (PEI-SPION
without magnetic field exposure) were used as control and treated
in the same way as their counterparts. PS rot mag indicates PEI-SPION
exposed to rotary magnetic fields. Data were shown as mean ±
SD of at least 3 independent experiments; ns: nonsignificant, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.

According to the results, a 60 rpm velocity is
enough to obtain
efficient transfection, and the distance is found to be an important
parameter for cell viability. Since the magnetic field effect is stronger
at shorter distances (2 and 2.5 cm), the number of dead cells is high.
Compared to that of 2 and 2.5 cm, the viability is improved at distances
of 3 and 3.5 cm. However, the 3.5 cm distance leads to a higher transfection
efficiency compared to the 3 cm. (Figure 6). Thus, 3.5 cm is chosen as the optimum
distance, and the magnetofection effect is further investigated at
different times (Figure 7). pDNA only, PEI, and PS w/o mag (PEI-SPION without magnetic field
exposure) were used as control and treated in the same way as their
counterparts. PS rot mag indicates PEI-SPION exposed to rotary magnetic
fields.

2 h experiment, cells are exposed to the magnetic field for 1 h and
then incubated at 37 °C for the additional 1 h. For the 4 h experiment,
cells are exposed to the magnetic field for 2 h and then incubated
at 37 °C for the additional 2 h. In both cases, transfection
solutions are removed after incubation by washing with PBS, and the
culture is maintained in fresh DMEM medium until incubation time is
achieved to 48 h. (a) GFP expression is observed by inverted fluorescence

At 2 h of experiment, transfection efficiency is low, while
it
increased at 4 h. However, at this time point, magnetic field exposure
for 2 h decreases the cell viability (Figure 7). Therefore, at a 3.5 cm distance, 1 h of
transfection time is investigated, and further enhancement of cell
viability and efficient transfection can be achieved (Figure 8a–f). According to results,
1 h of the transfection efficiency of PEI remained low (approximately
2%), while that of PS rot mag at 3.5 cm is approximately 50% (Figure 8). Therefore, we
could achieve high transfection efficiency as well as improved viability
by using PEI-coated SPIONs exposed to the rotary magnetic field. The
utilization of only PEI results in improved viability but failed transfection.

Many different magnetic systems are being used for gene transfer.
The popular ones are oscillating magnet arrays, placing magnets under
culture plates and magnet arrays.25,27,28 McBain et al.27 used an
oscillating magnet array and reported that human lung epithelial cells
were effectively transfected. They reported positive effects of the
system on viability. In our study, magnetic field application significantly
raised the viability. In addition, the transfection time was reduced
to 1 h since all the transfection agents were removed from the cells
at the end of 1 h.

Lu et al.28 used
a staggered magnet
array and placed two magnets underneath the culture plates. Two adjacent
magnets interfered with each other and had a negative effect on transfection.
Because the two magnets were affected by each other, they claimed
that the efficiency was more in between them. Accordingly, the cells,
which were located above the magnets, experienced a uniform magnetic
field, while the cells in the other wells of the plate were exposed
to nonuniform magnetic fields. The group concluded that the nonuniform
magnetic field was more suitable for in vivo studies. However, in
our system, we benefit from the condition of the interaction of two
magnets with each other. A uniform transfection could be obtained
under a nonuniform magnetic field by finding the appropriate distance
between the magnets and culture plate (Figure 2b). Cell experiments at various distances
were performed for this task. At the smallest distance of 2 cm, a
more concentrated cell population was seen around the magnet, and
a cell population was found distributed throughout the entire 10 cm
plate at the 3.5 cm distance.

PEI is an effective agent for
transfection. Some studies with PEI
reported that free PEI is needed for high transfection efficiencies,
and its effects on transfection were investigated.23 The results showed that nanoparticles could not enter into
the cell nucleus but free PEI in the medium helped in sending the
plasmids to the nucleus. In other words, since a sufficient number
of nanoparticles could not be directed to the core, excessive PEI
was concentrated in the cell. Therefore, it is important that the
cells should be in contact with PEI for short periods and in sufficient
quantities. Although PEI is a well-established effective transfection
agent, the toxicity of the material is a known fact.29 Some studies showed that using PEI-coated SPIONs for transfection
leads to less toxicity and improved efficiencies compared to the use
of only PEI.30,31 Moreover, Lipofectamine is another
reagent also widely used for transfection of cells with a very similar
experimental protocol of PEI. However, the main difference between
Lipofectamine and PEI is their mechanism of action on the cell membrane.
Lipofectamine creates DNA-encapsulated liposomes, and these liposomes
fuse with the cell membrane and thus release the DNA into the cytoplasm.32 On the other hand, in PEI transfection, the
cationic polymer interacts with the cell membrane so that DNA is introduced
to the cell via endocytosis.33 Although
some studies use Lipofectamine as a control, in most of the PEI-mediated
magnetofection studies, free PEI is used as a common control of its
nanoformulated versions.30,31,34−36 Accordingly, in our experimental setup, we investigate
the effect of magnetofection by applying a cationic polymer-based
transfection procedure using PEI-coated SPIONs. Therefore, we use
free PEI rather than lipofectamine. The nanoparticles were sent to
the cells with a total amount of 60 μg of PEI-bearing nanoparticle
solution, and the transfection times were changed while ensuring the
sufficiency of the amount used in the experiments. In addition, when
the duration of transfection is short, the efficiency of the transfection
by PEI-SPION nanoparticles is still significant because the capability
of the actuation system while using only PEI fails in achieving transfection
to the cells. Moreover, the use of PEI-coated SPION nanoparticles
was not associated with toxicity as we reported in our previous study.26

Huth et al. examined the nanoparticle
uptake of HeLa cells.37 They found that
the PEI-coated nanoparticles
were close to the cell membrane at the 5th minute, on the cell surface
at the 10th minute, and in the cell at the 15th minute. Motivated
by this finding, the purpose of our study is benefitting from a rotating,
that is, nonuniform, magnetic field to allow more particles to enter
the cell, thereby increasing the number of particles the cell can
encounter. In this regard, we prove that efficient transfection could
be obtained in a short time.

Accordingly, efficient transfection
can be achieved using nanoparticles
with our new generation actuation system even within a 1 h period
where standard PEI transfection was not successful. Thus, the viability
could be increased, and gene transfer would be efficient.

Due
to their adverse effects, viral and nonviral chemical vectors
should not be favored in gene therapy. In addition to their biosafety
problems, such vectors have a limited amount of access for transporting
exogenous DNA. Accordingly, research outputs in nanotechnology recommend
new techniques such as using magnetic nanoparticles in gene therapy,
especially in transfection, which could be ensured with our actuation
system.

Conclusions
Due to many advantages
such as manipulation capability and less
toxicity, their utilization in biotechnology has an increasing trend.
In this study, we presented a magnetic actuation system for transfection
and GFP-DNA transfer to MCF7 cells with PEI-SPION carriers. The results
showed that the magnetic field exposure increased the transfection
efficiency with nanoparticles while maintaining the viability. At
an optimum distance for a cell culture plate with a diameter of 10
cm, a uniform magnetic field distribution was obtained, and efficient
in vitro gene transfer was achieved. The system, which is developed
in this study, enables an efficient transfection within a short time
and could be easily tested in both vitro and in vivo studies.

Materials
and Methods
Cells and Reagents
The pmax-GFP mammalian expression
vector was supplied by Amaxa (Amaxa, Lonza, Switzerland). Branched
PEI (MW 25,000) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (408727-USA). Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(D5671-Germany). l-Glutamine (BIO3-020-1B), penicillin/streptomycin
(BIO3-031-1B), and trypsin–EDTA (BIO3-050-1A) were purchased
from Biological Industries (Israel). Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was
purchased from BioWest (S1810-USA). Phosphate buffered saline (PBS-17-516F)
without calcium or magnesium was purchased from Lonza (U.S.A.). The
breast cancer (MCF-7, HTB-22) cell line was obtained from American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC, U.S.A.).

Magnetic Actuation System
The system consists of a
rotary table, which has four rare-earth magnets, a 12 V DC motor,
power cables, and adjustable plexiglass stages for placing 10 cm petri
dishes (Figure 1).
The magnets were placed in such a way that their poles pulled each
other. Rotation of the table was provided with the 12 V DC motor.
The parts of the system were fabricated with the laser cutting and
3D printing techniques. Magnetic field fluxes of the magnets and the
variation of the magnetic field depending on the distance between
table and sample were measured by a gaussmeter (Hirst Magnetic Instruments
Ltd.). The system was also modeled via the ac/dc module of the COMSOL
Multiphysics 5.2a software for simulating the magnetic fluxes exerted
on the sample.

PEI-SPION Synthesis and Characterization
PEI-coated
SPIONs were prepared by a ligand exchange method as explained in our
previous work.26 This sample was directly
used for DLS (dynamic light scattering) and zeta potential measurements.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis was performed on a Bruker Dimension
Icon in the ScanAsyst mode in air with ScanAsyst-Air cantilever (Bruker,
U.S.A., k = 0.4 N/m, frequency = 70 kHz). The samples
were diluted with ethanol, sonicated, and drop-cast on a silicon wafer
for analysis. Eighty percent of the total product mass (PEI-SPION)
was determined as PEI by thermogravimetric analysis performed on dried
samples.

Plasmid DNA Isolation
Plasmid DNA isolation was performed
with a plasmid DNA purification kit according to manufacturer’s
instructions (Nucleobond Xtra Midi/Maxi, Macherey-Nagel, Germany).

Cell Culture
MCF-7 human breast cancer cells were cultured
in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics
(Penicillin–Streptomycin). Cells (1.2 × 106) were seeded on 10 cm culture plates in a 10 mL cell culture medium.
Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with
a 5% CO2 atmosphere.

Magnetofection
Sixty micrograms of 25 kDa branched
PEI (as control) or PEI-SPION solutions, which carried 60 μg
of 25 kDa branched PEI, was added into Eppendorf tubes containing
200 μL of DMEM (without serum and antibiotics). In another Eppendorf
tube, 10 μg of plasmid DNA (pDNA)-encoding GFP was mixed with
200 μL DMEM (without serum and antibiotics). To allow binding
of DNA to PEI and PEI-SPION particles, the transfection mixture is
incubated for 10 min at room temperature and then added dropwise onto
the culture plates. pDNA alone is used as a negative control of transfection.
For magnetofection experiments, cells were exposed to the magnetic
field for 1 h or 2 h and incubated for an additional 1 h or 2 h at
37 °C in the presence of the transfection agent. Then, the transfection
agent is removed by washing with PBS, and cells are cultured in fresh
DMEM medium until total incubation time is achieved to 48 h. In another
set, cells were washed right after 1 h magnetofection to remove the
uninternalized nanoparticles, fresh medium is added, and cells are
again cultured for 48 h. For experiments without the magnetic field
(PEI control, PS w/o mag), the same steps were carried out except
for the magnetic field exposure.

Microscopy Analysis and
Transfection Efficiency
At
48 h post-transfection, transfection efficiency was determined using
an inverted fluorescent microscope (Olympus IX70) with 10× magnification.
About 900 cells were counted for each sample.

Cell Viability Assays
Cells transfected with PEI or
PEI-SPION in the presence or absence of rotating magnetic field conditions
were harvested at 48 h post-transfection, and viability was assessed
by a mitochondrial function-based MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide] assay as described previously.29,30 Briefly, cells
were incubated for 4 h with 0.5 mg/mL MTT in complete medium. The
medium was then aspirated, and cells were lysed with DMSO to dissolve
formazan crystals. MTT is a yellow tetrazolium salt reducing to purple
formazan. The absorbance of formazan solution was measured on an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plate reader (iMark Microplate Reader,
Bio-Rad) at wavelengths of 570 and 655 nm.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed
using one-way ANOVA for multiple comparisons and the Student’s
t test for intergroup comparison. Data were represented as means ±
SD of at least three independent experiments. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
