Extended
surfactants with the oxypropylene (PO) group and ethoxylated
anionic surfactants with the oxyethylene (EO) group have a high salt
tolerance capability. Most of the researches on extended surfactants
and ethoxylated anionic surfactants focused on the microemulsion,
solubilization, and interfacial tension (IFT) of concentrated surfactant
solutions, whereas a few researches focused on the IFT of dilute surfactant
solutions. Moreover, a previous work focused only on surfactants with
PO numbers greater than 4 and copolymers of PO and EO. The effects
of extended surfactants containing short PO chains and no EO groups
have not been examined. We measured the IFT and optimal salinity between n-alkanes and dilute solutions of extended surfactants or
ethoxylated sulfonates at 30 °C. The effects of the surfactant
structure on the equilibrium interfacial tension (IFTeq) and optimal salinity of the system were studied in detail. As for
the effects on IFT, results indicate that the introduction of PO groups
leads to their enhanced capability to reduce the IFT prior to cross-salinity
and a reduction in the IFT between n-alkanes and
surfactant solutions to ultralow values (smaller than 0.01 mN/m) near
the optimal salinity. It was also found that extended surfactants
with different alkyl chains also entail a cross-salinity; at values
lower than the cross-salinity, the IFT reduction capacity of extended
surfactants with a long alkyl chain (C16P3SO3) is better than that
of extended surfactants with a short alkyl chain (C13P3SO3). As for
the effect on the optimal salinity, it was found that the optimal
salinity of extended surfactants is lower than that of ethoxylated
sulfonates for the same oil phase. It was also found that the optimal
salinity of extended surfactants first increased and later decreased
with increasing PON. This finding is first proposed based on summarizing
some researchers’ studies and our experiments.

Introduction
In the petroleum industry, surfactants
play a very important role
in the chemical flooding technology for enhancing oil recovery (EOR)
due to their capability of reducing interfacial tension. Besides surfactant
flooding, surfactants can be used in many chemical combination flooding
systems, such as surfactant/polymer,1−3 alkaline/surfactant/polymer,4−6 and surfactant/alkaline7−9 systems. Two distinct mechanisms
in reducing interfacial tension with surfactants have been found.
The first mechanism involves the aggregation of many surfactant molecules
at the brine–oil interface where the tension reaches the minimum
at a surfactant concentration under 1 wt %.10,11 The second mechanism occurs when a surfactant-rich microemulsion
phase forms at a surfactant/cosurfactant concentration above 1 wt
% and a low tension appears at the microemulsion–brine interface
or at the microemulsion–oil interface, or at both if both are
present.12,13

Petroleum sulfonate and alkyl-benzene
sulfonate are two classical
surfactants used in chemical flooding. The polar hydrophilic head
and nonpolar lipophilic tail of these surfactants are directly connected
by a chemical bond. The salt tolerance of this type of surfactants
is so low that solutions of these species become unstable and phase
separation occurs under high-salinity conditions (beyond 2 or 2.5
wt % NaCl14). The optimal salinity of NaCl
is in the range of 1 −2 wt %.15 As
a result, these surfactants are not efficient for the exploitation
of high-salinity oil fields. For exploiting high-salinity oil fields,
some researchers found that introducing a junction unit, such as oxyethylene
(EO) groups and oxypropylene (PO) groups, between the hydrophilic
head and lipophilic tail is expected to improve the interfacial performance
and salt tolerance capacity of surfactants. By inserting EO groups
or PO groups, two kinds of surfactants were invented: one comprised
ethoxylated anionic surfactants with only EO groups between the hydrophilic
head and the lipophilic tail; the other comprised so-called extended
surfactants with PO groups or PO–EO groups.

Ethoxylated
anionic surfactants were first developed in the 1930s.16 Since then, there was a dramatic increase of
research on the phase behavior, solubilization, and application in
the oil-field exploitation of high-concentration (more than 1 wt %)
ethoxylated anionic surfactant solutions, especially ethoxylated sulfonates.
Bansal et al.14,15 found that the addition of ethoxylated
sulfonates can extend the use of petroleum sulfonates at a higher
salinity (18 wt % NaCl to even 32 wt % NaCl), keeping the total surfactant
concentration constant at 5 wt %. Skauge et al.,17 Abe et al.,18 and Miller et
al.19 found that (i) branching of the alkyl
chain reduces the optimal salinity and solubilization parameter, (ii)
the benzene ring is equivalent to three methylene groups with respect
to optimal salinity and solubilization, (iii) increasing the EON can
increase the optimal salinity at a high degree of ethoxylation (EON
> 3), whereas at low degrees of ethoxylation, the solubilization
parameter
increases and the optimal salinity decreases. Besides the high-surfactant-concentration
condition, Aoudia et al.20 measured the
dynamic IFT of dilute surfactant solutions (0.1 wt %) and performed
some core flooding experiments.

Extended surfactants are composed
of some intermediate polarity
groups, such as PO groups or PO–EO groups, which are inserted
between the hydrophilic head and the lipophilic tail. Alkyl sulfate-extended
surfactants were initiated and applied for EOR by the Exxon Production
Research Company in the 1980s.21 Since
then, abundant tests emerged and tended to be more popular for applications
involving the interfacial properties, capability of forming microemulsions,
and solubilization of surfactant solutions with a high surfactant
concentration (more than 1 wt %) for long-chain alkanes, triglycerides,
vegetable oils, and crude oils. These experimental results indicate
that extended surfactants have the capability of forming middle-phase
microemulsions with high solubilization22−26 and an ultralow IFT26 for
a wide range of oils. The studies also indicated that PO groups can
extend the lipophilic portion into the deeper part of the oil phase
near the interface without sacrificing the water solubility and form
a smooth polarity-transition zone between the hydrocarbon and aqueous
phases. As a result of the increasing PON, the solubililzation increased
and the optimal salinity, critical micelle concentration (CMC), and
IFT decreased. Meanwhile, a few researchers measured the dynamic IFT
between different oils and dilute extended surfactant solutions (e.g.,
0.1,27,28 0.2,29 and 0.3
wt %30,31), with the following findings: (i) these
extended surfactants can achieve an ultralow IFT with a wide range
of oils, including highly hydrophobic oils (e.g., hexadecane), triglycerides,
triolein, and vegetable oils, using only ppm levels of these extended
surfactants;27−30 (ii) the introduction of PO groups in the extended surfactant yielded
a lower optimal salinity28−30 and a linear correlation with
the properties of the extended surfactants, such as a decreasing log(CMC),
a decreasing surface tension, and a decreasing ln S*31 (the optimal salinity for achieving
an ultralow IFT); (iii) increasing the degree of tail branching can
decrease the IFT;28 and (iv) when the tail
length of the surfactant is smaller, the optimal salinity increases.29 However, one of the limitations of sulfate surfactants
is their poor hydrolytic stability;32 new
extended surfactants with sulfonate as the head group were studied
recently. Guo et al.33 measured the dynamic
IFT between n-alkanes and solutions of four types
of alkyl sulfonate-extended surfactants with PO–EO groups and
concluded that the ratio of PON to EON is a key factor for controlling
interfacial properties.

As described above, most of these researches
focused on the microemulsion,
solubilization, and IFT of concentrated surfactant solutions of ethoxylated
sulfonates and sulfate-extended surfactants, and a few researches
focused on the IFT of dilute sulfonate-extended surfactant solutions.
Moreover, there is no report on the comparison of the properties of
sulfonate-extended surfactants and ethoxylated sulfonates. Although
the effect of PON on extended surfactant properties has been extensively
studied, most of the studies focused on copolymers of PO and EO and
a PON greater than 4. The effects of an extended surfactant structure
with a short PO chain and no EO group have not been studied yet.

In this paper, we synthesized one ethoxylated sulfonate and four
extended surfactants with sulfonate as the hydrophilic head, different
PONs, and different lipophilic tails. We measured dynamic IFTs between n-alkanes and different surfactant solutions and studied
the effects of the surfactant molecular structure, such as the PO
group, alkyl chain length, and alkane carbon number, on the equilibrium
IFT and optimal salinity. All of the salinities refer to the mass
percent only in terms of NaCl.

Results and Discussion
Morphology Change of n-Alkanes and Determination
of IFTeq
Figure 1 shows that the morphology of n-alkanes
changes with time under different experimental conditions. In Figure 1A, the morphology
of the n-octane droplet was constant, and so the
IFT remained at equilibrium in the beginning. In Figure 1B, the shape of the n-octane droplet was stretched with time, and then remained
consistent, and so the IFT reached the equilibrium value after a certain
time. In Figure 1C,
the n-decane droplet split into multiple oil droplets
due to an ultralow IFT. Then, the smaller oil droplets stretched quickly
at an ultralow IFT, and subsequently split into many smaller droplets.

Figure 1 Morphology
of n-alkane droplets changing with
time in C13P2SO3 solutions with different salinities: n-octane droplet in 2.5 wt % NaCl (A), n-octane droplet
in 7.5 wt % NaCl (B), and n-decane droplet in 10
wt % NaCl (C).

We chose the average
IFT under equilibrium conditions as the IFTeq. The IFTeq values between different n-alkanes and
C13P2SO3 solutions are shown in Figure 2. The values represent the average of two
independent experiments. The standard deviations are smaller than
6%, especially smaller than 1% because the IFTeq is very
small at 7.5, 10, and 12.5 wt % NaCl.

Figure 2 IFTeq between n-alkanes and the solutions
of C13P2SO3.

Effects of PO and EO
Figure 3 compares
the effects of PO and EO on the
IFTeq between n-alkanes and solutions
of C13E3SO3 or C13P3SO3. As shown in Figure 3, the IFTeq curves for C13P3SO3
and the IFTeq curves for C13E3SO3 cross each other. When
the concentration of NaCl is lower than that at the cross-salinity,
the IFTeq between n-alkanes and C13P3SO3
solutions is lower than that between n-alkanes and
C13E3SO3 solutions. When the salinity is higher than the cross-salinity,
the IFTeq between n-alkanes and C13P3SO3
solutions is higher than that between n-alkanes and
C13E3SO3 solutions. Moreover, the optimal salinity of C13P3SO3 is
lower than that of C13E3SO3.

Figure 3 IFTeq between n-octane
and C13E3SO3
or C13P3SO3 solutions (A), n-decane and C13E3SO3
or C13P3SO3 solutions (B), and n-dodecane and C13E3SO3
or C13P3SO3 solutions (C) at different salinities.

According to the surfactant assignment model,34 the IFTeq mainly depends on the number
of molecules
and the adsorption strength of the surfactant on the oil–water
interface. As more surfactant molecules adsorb on the oil–water
interface, and when the adsorption strength increases, the resulting
IFT becomes lower. Additionally, under any given condition, the adsorption
rate and adsorption strength of the surfactant molecules on the oil–water
interface are related to the hydrophilic–lipophilic balance.
The hydrophilicity and lipophilicity of common groups are shown in Table 1(35)

Table 1 Cardinal Number of Hydrophilic Groups
and Lipophilic Groups

The sulfonic group is highly hydrophilic;
the PO group is weakly
lipophilic, and the EO group is hydrophilic. As a result, the introduction
of PO groups to displace the EO groups can improve the lipophilicity
and the adsorption capability of the surfactant molecules on the oil–water
interface.

Figure 4 shows the
effect of salinity on the distribution of the surfactant in oil/water
phases. According to the surfactant assignment model and the hydrophilicity
and lipophilicity of common groups, C13E3SO3 molecules disperse more
easily in the water phase and more C13P3SO3 molecules adsorb on the
oil–water interface at a low salinity as shown in Figure 4A. Under this condition,
the IFTeq between oil and the C13P3SO3 solution is lower
than that between oil and the C13E3SO3 solution. As the salinity increases,
salinity can compress the thickness of the ion atmosphere of ionic
surfactants and damage the peripheral hydration film of the hydrophilic
group, reducing the hydrophilicity of the surfactant and allowing
the molecules to gradually diffuse into the oil phase from the water
phase, through the interface between the phases. Because of C13P3SO3
molecules’ higher lipophilicity, C13P3SO3 molecules reach the
maximum amount at the interface between the phases ahead of C13E3SO3
molecules, and the salinity reaches the optimal value for C13P3SO3
as shown in Figure 4B; the distribution of C13P3SO3 molecules in different phases is
in equilibrium, which causes the IFTeq to reach its lowest
value. As shown in Figure 4C, as the salinity continues to increase, a considerable number
of C13P3SO3 molecules diffuse into the oil phase, and amount of C13E3SO3
molecules continues to adsorb at the interface between the phases.
There is an adsorption condition that the IFTeq of each
oil–water system is equal at the cross-salinity as shown in Figure 3. When the distribution
of the C13E3SO3 molecules approaches equilibrium with increasing salinity,
the salinity of C13E3SO3 reaches the optimal value as shown in Figure 4D and the IFTeq between oil and the C13E3SO3 solution reaches the lowest
value.

Figure 4 Effect of salinity on the distribution of the surfactant in oil/water
phases at different salinities: lower than optimal salinity of C13P3SO3
(A), optimal salinity of C13P3SO3 (B), higher than optimal salinity
of C13P3SO3 and lower than optimal salinity of C13E3SO3 (C), optimal
salinity of C13E3SO3(D), and higher than optimal salinity of C13E3SO3
(E).

Additionally, the result that
the optimal salinity of C13P3SO3
is significantly lower than that of C13E3SO3 also can be explained
by the Winsor R ratio theory.17,29 According to the Winsor R ratio theory, there are
three blocks in the oil–water system, including the water region
(W), oil region (O), and amphiphilic region (C), as shown in Figure 5. The amphiphilic
region is defined as a layer of surfactant molecules with a certain
thickness and binary hydrophobicity. In this layer, the hydrophilic
portion of the surfactant infiltrates into the water phase, whereas
the lipophilic portion infiltrates into the oil phase. The intermolecular
interactions existing in the amphiphilic region are expressed by cohesive
energy A.

Figure 5 Interactions between different molecules at
the oil/water interface.

On the side of the lipophilic group layer, Aoo is the cohesive energy between oil molecules, All is the cohesive energy between lipophilic
groups, and Alco is the cohesive energy
between the lipophilic
group and the oil molecule. On the side of the hydrophilic group layer, Aww is the cohesive energy between water molecules, Ahh is the cohesive energy between hydrophilic
groups, and Ahcw is the cohesive energy
between the hydrophilic group and the water molecule. Additionally, Alcw is the interaction between the lipophilic
group and the water molecule. Alco is
the interaction between the hydrophilic group and the oil molecule.
The cohesive energy Aco between the whole
surfactant molecule and the oil molecule is the sum of Alco and Ahco. The cohesive
energy Acw between the whole surfactant
molecule and the water molecule is the sum of Ahcw and Alcw. Because Alcw and Ahco are very weak
compared to the other cohesive energies, they can be ignored. Then,
the definition of R ratio is presented in eq 1 1  When R = 1, the distribution
of the surfactant at the oil–water interface reaches its optimal
state, and the mutual effect among the oil phase, water phase, and
amphiphilic region is in an equilibrium state. Under this condition,
the IFT is the lowest. If one variable is changed, the hydrophilicity
and lipophilicity of the surfactant will be altered and the oil–water
system will deviate from its optimal state. However, in certain cases,
if two variables are altered simultaneously, it is possible that the
system could retain its optimal state. Such changes are identified
as a compensation relationship. As shown in Figure 3, if the EO groups are displaced by PO groups,
the molecule’s lipophilicity will be improved and R will increase according to eq 1. To compensate for improvements in the molecule’s
lipophilicity as caused by the presence of PO groups, the salinity
can be decreased to improve the molecule’s hydrophilicity,
maintaining the oil–water system in its optimal state. Therefore,
the optimal salinity of C13P3SO3 was lower than that of C13E3SO3 in
this work.

Effects of the Number of PO Groups
Figure 6 shows the
variation curves
of the IFTeq between n-alkanes and C13PnSO3 solutions at different salinities. For the same alkane,
when the salinity is below a certain value, if the C13PnSO3 molecule contains more PO groups, the IFTeq between n-alkanes and C13PnSO3 solutions is lower.
Taking the oil phase of n-dodecane as an example,
prior to the optimal salinity for C13P4SO3, the C13P4SO3 with the
most PO groups in our experiments led to the lowest IFTeq between n-alkanes and solutions. Further, in this
case, the IFTeq between n-alkanes and
C13P3SO3 solutions is lower than the IFTeq between n-alkanes and C13P2SO3 solutions. This result shows that
the IFTeq can decrease with increasing numbers of PO groups
under low-salinity conditions. This can be explained by the fact that
increasing the PON changed the oleophilic and hydrophilic properties
of the surfactant and improved the aggregation capability of the surfactant
to the oil phase before the optimal salinity.

Figure 6 IFTeq between n-octane and C13PnSO3 solutions (A), n-decane and C13PnSO3 solutions (B), and n-dodecane and
C13PnSO3 solutions (C) at different salinities.

Additionally, this result demonstrates
that the optimal salinity
of extended surfactants first increases and then decreases with increasing
PON. Zeng et al.36 found that the optimal
salinity increased with increasing PON when studying the IFT between
polyoxypropylene ether sulfate with lower numbers of PO groups and
pure hydrocarbons. As previously reported, the optimal salinity decreased
as the PON increased.28−31 In combination with the data presented in this paper, a law can
be deduced, specifically, that the optimal salinity of extended surfactants
is affected by PO groups. The optimal salinity first increases and
then decreases with increasing PON for one type of extended surfactants.
There is an appropriate PON keeping one type of extended surfactants
with the highest optimal salinity. Salager’s group37 suggested that the first two to three PO groups
in the extended surfactant are likely to be slightly hydrated and
bent to accommodate some proximity of the interface for the first
propylene oxide groups assembled closed to the oil/water interface.
As a result, the improvement of the molecule’s hydrophilicity
by a few PO groups can be compensated by increasing the salinity to
retain the system in its optimal state. Therefore, the presence of
a few PO groups on the molecule can increase the optimal salinity.
However, when PON reaches a certain value, the lipophilicity of the
PO group comes into play. Then, increasing the PON can improve the
lipophilicity of the molecule, which can be compensated by decreasing
the salinity to retain the system’s optimal state. Therefore,
the optimal salinity decreases with increasing PON at values more
than 4.

Effects of the Alkyl Chain Length
Figure 7 shows the IFTeq variation curves between n-alkanes and solutions
of extended surfactants with different alkyl chains at different salinities.

Figure 7 IFTeq between n-octane and C13P3SO3
or C16P3SO3 solutions (A), n-decane and C13P3SO3
or C16P3SO3 solutions (B), and n-dodecane and C13P3SO3
or C16P3SO3 solutions (C) at different salinities.

As shown in Figure 7, the IFTeq between n-octane
and C13P3SO3
solutions is lower than the IFTeq between n-octane and C16P3SO3 solutions over the whole range of experimental
salinity. However, the IFTeq between other n-alkanes (n-decane or n-dodecane)
and C16P3SO3 solutions is lower than that between other n-alkanes (n-decane or n-dodecane)
and C13P3SO3 solutions in the range of medium–low salinity,
reversing in the range of high salinity. According to the assignment
model, the presence of a relatively long lipophilic group has caused
the distribution of the C16P3SO3 molecules among the oil and water
phases to reach equilibrium more easily than the C13P3SO3 molecules.
Therefore, in the range of medium–low salinity, C16P3SO3 has
a stronger interfacial adsorption capability, which produces a lower
IFTeq between C16P3SO3 and either n-decane
or n-dodecane. When the salinity is higher, the water
solubility of C16P3SO3 decreases, leading to the dispersion of more
C16P3SO3 molecules in the oil phase, whereas the distribution of C13P3SO3
molecules on the oil–water interface approaches equilibrium.
The approach of C13P3SO3 molecules to an equilibrium distribution
leads to a lower IFTeq between n-alkanes
and C13P3SO3 solutions than that between n-alkanes
and C16P3SO3 solutions.

The range of the optimal salinity of
C16P3SO3 is associated with
the molecule’s relatively long lipophilic group chain, which
is lower than that of C13P3SO3 (i.e., a comparatively short lipophilic
chain). This can be explained by a reason similar to that for the
optimal salinity of C13P3SO3 being lower than that of C13E3SO3. Because
the lipophilicity of C16P3SO3 is stronger than the lipophilicity of
C13P3SO3, the salinity should be decreased to enhance the hydrophilicity
of C16P3SO3 and compensate for the enhanced lipophilicity. It is also
believed that the addition of salt can enhance the aggregation of
surfactant molecules at the oil–water interface. When the system
reaches the optimal salinity, the adsorption of the surfactant molecules
at the oil–water interface reaches equilibrium and the IFT
is the lowest. Because the C16P3SO3 molecules have a higher capability
to transit to the oil–water interface than C13P3SO3 molecules,
it is significantly easier for the C16P3SO3 solution to reach adsorption
equilibrium at a lower salinity.

Effect of the Alkane Carbon
Number on the Optimal Salinity
Table 2 shows the
optimal salinity of ethoxylated sulfonates and extended surfactants.
The optimal salinity increases with the alkane carbon number. For
a given oil phase, every surfactant solution has a corresponding optimal
salinity that optimizes the state of the system at a fixed surfactant
concentration. Under this condition, R = 1. If the
alkane carbon number of the oil phase increases, the intermolecular
cohesive energy Aoo of the oil phase also
increases, leading to a decrease of R. Accordingly,
the compensation for the decrease of R can be promoted
by raising the salt concentration, known as a hydrophilic–lipophilic
compensation. Therefore, as the alkane carbon number of the oil phase
is increased, the corresponding optimal salinity also increases. With
increasing optimal salinity, it can be observed that the low-IFT regions
of C13P3SO3 and C13E3SO3 shift to the right in Figure 3 and lead to an increase of the cross-salinity.

Conclusions
Based
on the above discussion, the following conclusions can be
drawn: (1) Compared with C13E3SO3, C13P3SO3 exhibits a better capacity
to reduce the IFT when the salinity is less than the critical salinity,
which increases with the alkane carbon number. However, C13P3SO3 has
a smaller optimal salinity than C13E3SO3. (2) At a given salinity,
the capacity to reduce the IFT of C13PnSO3 is improved
with increasing numbers of PO groups. If there is no change in the
oil phase, the optimal salinity of C13PnSO3 first
increases and then decreases with increasing numbers of PO groups,
which is a phenomenon first suggested here. (3) A cross-salinity also
exists for extended surfactants with different alkyl chains. C16P3SO3
has a better capacity to lower the interfacial tension than C13P3SO3
at salinities below the critical salinity. The optimal salinity of
C16P3SO3 is lower than that of C13P3SO3 for different n-alkanes. (4) For a given surfactant solution, alkane variation significantly
affects the optimal salinity, which tends to increase with the alkane
carbon number. Based on this finding, we can test the alkane carbon
number of crude oils first, and then select the appropriate surfactants
to be applied in enhancing oil recovery.

Measurement
of the Dynamic IFT
In this study, the dynamic
IFTs between 0.1 wt % surfactant solutions and n-alkanes
at different salinities were measured using an American Texas-500A
spinning-drop interfacial tensiometer, equipped with a camera for
image acquisition. All experiments were performed at 30.0 ± 0.1
°C.

A surfactant solution, including a specified amount
of NaCl, was injected into the sample tube as the water phase; then,
1.5 μL of alkane was injected into the middle of the tube as
the oil phase. The oil phase shape images at different times were
obtained by an interfacial tensiometer. Figure 1 shows how the images of the oil droplet
shape changed with time. Then, the images are processed through an
image-processing tool developed by our lab to obtain the dynamic IFT
according to eq 2. 2  where Δρ,
ω, and r are the difference in density between
the oil and water
phases, the angular velocity, and the minor axis semi-diameter of
the droplet, respectively.
