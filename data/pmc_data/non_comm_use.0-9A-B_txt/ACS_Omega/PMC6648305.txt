Supported
lipid bilayers (SLBs) are simple and robust biomimics with controlled
lipid composition that are widely used as models of both mammalian
and bacterial membranes. However, the lipids typically used for SLB
formation poorly resemble those of bacterial cell membranes due to
the lack of available protocols to form SLBs using mixtures of lipids
relevant for bacteria such as phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylglycerol
(PG). Although a few reports have been published recently on the formation
of SLBs from Escherichia coli lipid
extracts, a detailed understanding of these systems is challenging
due to the complexity of the lipid composition in such natural extracts.
Here, we present for the first time a simple and reliable protocol
optimized to form high-quality SLBs using mixtures of PE and PG at
compositions relevant for Gram-negative membranes. We show using neutron
reflection and quartz microbalance not only that Ca2+ ions
and temperature are key parameters for successful bilayer deposition
but also that mass transfer to the surface is a limiting factor. Continuous
flow of the lipid suspension is thus crucial for obtaining full SLB
coverage. We furthermore characterize the resulting bilayers and report
structural parameters, for the first time for PE and PG mixtures,
which are in good agreement with those reported earlier for pure POPE
vesicles. With this protocol in place, more suitable and reproducible
studies can be conducted to understand biomolecular processes occurring
at cell membranes, for example, for testing specificities and to unravel
the mechanism of interaction of antimicrobial peptides.

Introduction
Supported lipid bilayers
(SLBs) are often used as models of biological membranes to either
characterize the structural and dynamic properties of the membrane
itself or to study biomolecular interactions at the membrane. The
great majority of the studies include SLBs formed either from saturated
or unsaturated phosphatidylcholine (PC) species.1−4 To make more appropriate mimics
of mammalian membranes, PC is typically mixed with either sterols5 or charged lipids such as phosphatidylserine,6 phosphatidylglycerol (PG),7 and most recently phosphatidylinositols.8 For bacterial membranes, on the other hand, mixtures of
PC with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)9 and
PG10,11 have been used mainly due to the belief
that it is not possible to form SLBs of high coverage via the vesicle
fusion method using PE and PG lipids.12 In some cases, pure PC membranes were used to determine the mechanism
of action of antimicrobial compounds.13−15 Recently, PE-rich SLBs
were formed in mixtures with PC in an attempt to create more relevant
model bacterial membranes.9 As an alternative
to vesicle fusion Langmuir–Blodgett/Langmuir–Schaefer
deposition has been successfully applied to produce advanced models
of bacterial membranes using PC and liposaccharides,16−18 but this method is significantly more time-consuming and requires
high technical skills to succeed. However, the membranes produced
by the Langmuir–Blodgett/Langmuir–Schaefer method are
asymmetric in nature and represent an accurate model of the outer
membrane of Gram-negative bacteria.

The molar ratio of PE to
PG in bacterial membranes is 1:6 (17% PG) in the outer and 1:3 (33%
PG) in the inner or cytosolic membranes of Gram-negative bacteria,
respectively.19,20 Therefore, typical bilayer models
that mimic bacterial membranes contain 20–30% PG mixed with
PC.10

The lack of success in forming
SLBs with PE and PG has been attributed in part to the negatively
charged PG head groups and in part to the molecular shape of POPE.
It has been argued that lipids with cylindrical shapes and a packing
parameter close to 1 such as PC are required to form SLBs.21 PE has been reported to give hexagonal liquid
crystalline structures (explained as a consequence of its small headgroup)
even though the PE rich polar extracts of Escherichia
coli present a lamellar packing.20 However, stable SLBs were formed by 1,2-dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine
(DPPE) using Langmuir–Blodgett/Langmuir–Schaefer deposition
in the past.22 We have previously shown
by a set of complementary surface-sensitive techniques including atomic
force microscopy, quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D),
and neutron reflection (NR) that SLBs made from polar lipid extracts
of E. coli could be formed by vesicle
fusion.23 Deposition was successfully achieved
by tip sonication of a lipid suspension in Tris buffer at pH 7.4 supplemented
with 2 mM CaCl2 at 50 °C. Natural E.
coli lipid extracts include cardiolipin (CL) besides
PG and PE, and a detailed structural analysis is therefore complicated
due to the unknown and complex lipid composition of the final SLB.23 For more controlled studies, it is thus favorable
to use mixtures of standard commercially available lipids with known
molecular properties such as mass and component volumes.

Here,
we present the optimization of the formation of SLBs composed of negatively
charged 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol)
(POPG) and zwitterionic 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine
(POPE) on silica (see Figure 1A for the chemical structures of these lipids). The optimization
was performed using both NR and QCM-D, and the structure of POPE–POPG
SLBs is reported for the first time. In contrast to QCM-D, NR measures
the scattering length density perpendicular to the surface, which
relates to the dry surface coverage, the level of hydration, and the
structure down to 5 Å resolution. Therefore, NR excels at determining
the exact coverage of the SLB upon vesicle fusion. Figure 1B gives a simulation of the
NR signal as a function of the SLB coverage. QCM-D, on the other hand,
determines the wet mass of the film and is sensitive to the presence
of unfused vesicles on the surface. In this study, the PG content
was varied between 10 and 25 mol % to create mimics of the Gram-negative
bacteria membranes.

Results and Discussion
Divalent cations like Mg2+ or Ca2+ are commonly
used to neutralize the net negative charge of the glycerol headgroup
in POPG while also bridging to the anionic silica surface. This neutralization
and bridging leads to vesicle aggregation as measured by dynamic light
scattering (DLS) (see Supporting Information (SI) Figure S1). Recently, it was shown that CaCl2 induced
an apparent size increase in vesicle suspensions made from E. coli extracts; however, the size increase was
mainly due to vesicle aggregation and not due to vesicle fusion, and
this vesicle aggregation was reversible upon diluting with Ca2+-free buffer.24 Here, CaCl2 was used as the fusion promotor, and several concentrations
were tested for optimizing the deposition with NR and QCM-D connected
in series on the NR beamline. SLB formation via vesicle fusion is
facilitated by using lipids in the fluid phase. The melting temperature
(Tm) of POPG is −2 °C,25 and the calorimetric Tm of POPE was reported to be 38 °C26,27 although Avanti Lipids report 25 °C in their specifications.
Thus, if deposition is carried out at room temperature, the lipids
may still be in the gel phase rather than in the liquid phase due
to the high phase-transition temperature of POPE. It is possible to
form SLBs in the gel phase;28 however,
for lipids with a typical nonfusing behavior, it is particularly important
to optimize the deposition conditions to get high-quality SLBs.

Here, initially NR was used to investigate the formation of an SLB
of 75 mol % POPE and 25 mol % POPG (hereon referred to as 25 mol %
PG) at 37 °C, well above the Tm of
POPE. NR data were collected at the time-of-flight INTER reflectometer
at the ISIS neutron source in the U.K. over the Q-range of 0.08–0.25 Å−1 by using two
incident angles (0.7 and 2.3°) at a Q resolution
of 3%. Figure 2 gives
the NR profile upon continuous addition of 0.1 mg/mL lipid vesicles
in 1 or 2 mM CaCl2 at a flow rate of 1 mL/min by the use
of a syringe pump. The addition of 20 mL of the lipid solution in
1 mM CaCl2 showed no significant surface adsorption (<10
vol %) as seen from Figure 2 (red curve). To assess the importance of the calcium concentration,
an additional 20 mL of lipids in 2 mM CaCl2 was added to
the same surface under continuous flow. The elevated CaCl2 concentration led to poor bilayer coverage (yellow curve in Figure 2; compare with the
simulation in Figure 1). A second, independent, experiment was then carried out with continuous
flow of 50 mL of the lipid solution in 2 mM CaCl2 to a
clean surface, resulting in a surface coverage similar to that obtained
when adding only 20 mL of the solution (blue curve in Figure 2). This suggests that the deposition
of 25 mol % PG in the presence of 2 mM CaCl2 at 37 °C
leads to SLBs with unsatisfactory surface coverage.

Figure 2 NR profiles obtained
in D2O contrast after continuous flow of a solution of
0.1 mg/mL 25 mol % PG vesicles at 37 °C onto a silicon oxide
substrate at 1 mL/min. Red: 20 mL lipid solution in 1 mM CaCl2; yellow: the same experiment as the red curve, but after
the addition of another 20 mL of lipids in 2 mM CaCl2;
blue: a replicate experiment with 50 mL of lipid solution added in
2 mM CaCl2 to a clean surface.

To assess the effect of temperature, a third experiment was
carried out at 50 °C: a temperature that previously resulted
in successful SLB deposition of polar lipid extracts from E coli.23Figure 3A gives time-resolved kinetic
NR data for the continuous addition of 25 mol % PG vesicles at 50
°C using 3 mM CaCl2. In this case, measurements were
carried out at a single incidence angle (2.3°) corresponding
to a Q-range of 0.03–0.3 Å–1, where changes in the reflectivity are the most pronounced (see Figure 1B). The NR data were
fitted to a layered SLB model consisting of three slabs (heads–tail–heads:
see Figure 1C), and Figure 3B (red curve) gives
the fitted SLB coverage as a function of time during continuous lipid
flow. This figure also includes the data for deposition at 2 mM CaCl2 (blue curve) under the same experimental conditions. The
data show that an SLB with full coverage could be obtained using both
2 and 3 mM CaCl2 and that 3 mM CaCl2 gave a
slightly faster kinetics of SLB formation. Our data indicate that
electrostatics are critical for fusion to take place and it is essential
to have enough Ca2+ present to bridge vesicles and to fuse
them to the SiO2 surface. However, reproducible deposition
of lipids prepared for different experiments (with different lipid
and CaCl2 stocks) was only obtained at 3 mM CaCl2. This suggests not only that deposition at 50 °C is necessary
to obtain a high bilayer coverage, but also that the critical CaCl2 concentration for fusion is close to or just above 2 mM.
Hence, small differences in the lipid film composition or the actual
CaCl2 stock concentration caused by inaccuracies in the
sample preparation can influence the degree of SLB coverage when using
2 mM CaCl2.

Figure 3 (A) NR data and best fits for the kinetics of deposition
of 25 mol % PG with 3 mM CaCl2 at 50 °C. The inset
in (A) shows the corresponding SLD profiles for the best fits. In
(B), the fitted SLB coverage is given as a function of time for a
10 mol % PG SLB deposited at 50 °C in 3 mM CaCl2 (purple)
or 25 mol % PG at 50 °C with 2 mM (blue) or 3 mM CaCl2 (green and red). The model used to fit the SLB is described in detail
in the main text regarding the discussion of Figure 4. The NR kinetic data for the other data
sets are shown in the Supporting Information Figures S3–S5.

The final SLB structure was obtained upon collection of NR
data over the full Q-range (0.08–0.25 Å1) in two isotopic contrasts: 100% D2O and 100%
H2O. Figure 4 gives the NR data and best fits for a 25
mol % PG SLB formed with 3 mM CaCl2 at 50 °C and after
cooling down to relevant experimental temperatures such as 37 and 25 °C. Details on data fitting
and the final fitted parameters are given in the methods section and
the Supporting Information. Briefly, the
data were fitted assuming a symmetric bilayer in which the inner heads,
tails, and outer heads were represented as individual layers. In the
bilayer model, an additional water layer was added below the SLB,
which represents the water trapped in the roughness of the SiO2 substrate. At 50 and 37 °C, the bilayer displayed full
coverage (no solvent penetration into the lipid core), thin headgroups
(5.5 ± 0.5 Å), a tail thickness of 31 ± 0.5 Å2, and a mean molecular area of 60 Å2. Our
data suggest that the lipid core thickens slightly from 31 to 32 Å
upon lowering the temperature from 37 to 25 °C, leading to negligible
changes in the head group hydration and a slight decrease in the mean
molecular area of the lipids (59 Å2). The molecular
area of pure POPE bilayers were reported to be ∼61 and 58 Å2 at 50 and 35 °C,29,30 respectively, in excellent
agreement with our results. Importantly, our NR data clearly show
that there is no significant loss of lipids upon cooling and that
there are no significant changes in the structure of the SLB.

and subsequently cooled to 37 °C (yellow) and 25 °C (blue).
The bilayer was characterized in D2O and H2O
at all three temperatures. The inset shows the SLD profile for the
SLB that gives no structural differences between 50 and 37 °C,
whereas a 1.0 ± 0.5 Å thickening of the lipid core took
place for 25 °C. The same data have been replotted as RQ(4) vs Q in
the Supporting Information Figure S9 to
highlight the quality of the fits.

Earlier it was shown that stable DPPE SLBs with a headgroup
thickness of 7 Å in the fluid phase could be formed by Langmuir–Blodgett/Langmuir–Schaefer
deposition.22 This headgroup thickness
is slightly larger than those found here for POPE–POPG. Fluid
POPC SLBs were previously reported to have a headgroup thickness of
8 Å and a core thickness of 31 Å with an mean molecular
area (MMA) of 61 Å2 at 25 °C.1 Slightly thinner cores (30 Å) were reported for fluid
POPC–POPG (75:25 mol %) SLBs at 25 °C,1,7 whereas
the headgroup was found to be between 87 and 10 Å1 for these systems. Moreover,
the lipid core thicknesses for POPE were reported to be 32 and 31
Å at 50 and 35 °C,29,30 respectively,29,30 also in excellent agreement with our results. Molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations suggested that the P–P distance in POPE–POPG
bilayers was only 0.5 Å thinner than that in POPC bilayers (values
that are at the very limit of what NR can detect) and that the PE
preferentially interacted with PG rather than with other PE headgroups.31 Such a preferential interaction between the
PE and PG heads might explain why we see a 2 Å thinner headgroup
than that reported for pure PE earlier.22 A different MD simulation study suggested that below the Tm, POPE bilayers contained primarily lipids
in a tilted arrangement with a more compact lipid packing compared
with POPC, due to the smaller headgroup in POPE molecules. This tilting,
however, disappeared as the bilayers became fluid.32 Therefore, our data seem to be in agreement with the structural
parameters predicted by MD simulations and earlier reports for pure
PE22 and PC bilayers.1 Finally, similar changes in the thickness of the POPE–POPG
SLBs due to changes in temperature were reported earlier for POPE
and POPG SLBs made by Langmuir–Blodgett deposition.33

To investigate the role of the lipid composition,
time-resolved NR data were subsequently collected for SLB formation
of 10 mol % PG vesicles at 50 °C upon constant flow using a syringe
pump at 1 mL/min and a solution containing 0.1 mg/mL lipids in 3 mM
CaCl2 (Supporting Information Figure S3). As the negative charge was significantly lower, faster
deposition took place and full coverage (95 ± 1 vol %) was obtained
within 10 min, as seen in Figure 3. The experiment was again carried out for one incident
angle (2.3°), but this time in event mode, where one continuous
reflectivity measurement is performed and, afterward, sliced into
sensible time frames to give optimized statistics for fast deposition
kinetics (kinetic data for 10 mol % PG can be found in the Supporting
Information Figure S5). The structure of
the 10% PG membrane was similar to that of the 25% PG membrane.

So far, we demonstrated the successful formation of SLBs made of
POPE and POPG deposited via vesicle fusion using NR. Although this
technique is not highly sensitive toward diffuse structures such as
vesicles, we have observed the effect of vesicle adsorption on the
reflectivity profile previously.28 QCM-D,
on the other hand, excels at detecting small adsorbed amounts of such
large, water-filled structures10 as these
give rise to a large change in dissipation (softness of the adsorbed
layer) and a small frequency change (wet adsorbed mass). Therefore,
we used the Q-sense E4 QCM-D system connected in-line with the NR
cell and monitored the SLB deposition in parallel on a small SiO2 sensor. Figure 5 and Supporting Information Figure S7 give
the QCM-D signals for the deposition of POPE–POPG SLBs using
3 mM CaCl2 for 25 and 10 mol % PG, respectively. Upon vesicle
injection, no overshooting in the frequency or dissipation took place,
which is the typical fingerprint for successful SLB formation.34 Instead, a continuous decrease in frequency
occurred until steady state was reached at approximately −25
Hz regardless of the composition. For the dissipation, steady state
was reached at 1.5 or 0.5 × 10−6 units for
25 and 10 mol %, respectively. Moreover, a very small spreading of
the overtones was measured for 25 mol % PG, whereas no spreading at
all took place for 10 mol % PG. The QCM-D data altogether suggest
that the lipid vesicles fuse upon contact with the SiO2 surface and that there is no critical coverage of bound vesicles
needed for the vesicles to break as has been suggested earlier for
PC lipids in buffer.34,35 However, it is clear that vesicle
adsorption is the limiting step in the deposition of POPE–POPG
SLBs in agreement with the theoretical model and stochastic simulations
for the adsorption process of vesicles on surfaces reported earlier
by Plunkett et al.35 Interestingly, this
model indicated that a critical vesicle concentration with overshooting
in lipid adsorption (vesicles) occurred only under a very narrow set
of conditions, and it was therefore more likely to observe saturation
kinetics in the adsorption of the SLB without the typical overshooting
in frequency and dissipation as observed here for POPE–POPG
bilayers.

Figure 5 QCM-D signals for the formation of an SLB with 25 mol % PG in D2O. Events labeled with consecutive numbers mark the following:
1, MQ water with 3 mM CaCl2; 2, 0.1 mg/mL lipids; 3, pump
stopped; 4, D2O rinse for 30 min (peak from removal of
CaCl2); and 5, pump stopped. While the pump is on (at a
high flow rate, 1 mL/min), it creates a pressure, which appears like
added mass. When the pump is off, the bilayer frequency stabilizes
at −25 Hz.

Moreover, the minimal
overtone spreading measured indicates that no significant additional
vesicle adsorption takes place on top of the SLB (this is especially
true for the 10 mol % PG SLB; Supporting Information Figure S7). For 10 mol % PG, the final frequency value was
slightly above −25 Hz, supporting the NR data with almost complete
SLB formation (95% surface coverage).

Note that the use of an
inline QCM-D implies that the lipid solution was pumped first through
the NR cell setup and subsequently through the QCM-D sensor cells.
This means that the high flow rate needed for the NR experiment creates
a local pressure upon pushing the solution inside the much smaller
QCM-D cell. This gives signal alterations in the QCM-D that relax
upon turning the pump off. Supporting Information Figure S8 gives the QCM-D data collected at 37 °C and
2 mM CaCl2, which gave insignificant lipid adsorption on
the Si crystal in the NR setup (red curve in Figure 2), although some adsorption occurred on the
QCM-D sensor (Δf = ∼ −15 Hz).
This experiment clearly shows that a discontinued flow leads to a
plateau in the QCM-D signals and arrested lipid adsorption. Addition
of a new lipid solution prepared in 2 mM CaCl2 led to typical
QCM-D signals that are considered as full bilayer coverage in the
QCM-D, but in the NR cell the bilayer coverage was low. This suggests
that the mass transfer to the surface is the limiting factor to determine
successful deposition of an SLB of 25 mol % PG and that it is important
to keep a constant lipid flow until a complete coverage is reached.
Moreover, it is important to properly rinse off the vesicle suspension
as soon as the SLB is formed since prolonged exposure of the SLB to
the vesicle suspension can lead to deposition of a liquid crystalline
phase from the bulk solution resulting in the appearance of a Bragg
peak (Supporting Information Figure S6).
The phase separation occurs in solution due to vesicle aggregation
in the presence of CaCl2. Prolonged vesicle incubation
was also shown to lead to irreversible vesicle binding of E. coli extracts in the presence of CaCl2.24

Although both NR and QCM-D sensor
surfaces are made of SiO2, it should be stressed that the
surfaces are not identical. In particular, the roughness of the QCM-D
Si sensors is 1 order of magnitude higher than that for polished NR
surfaces (4–6 Å RMS). A certain surface roughness may
enhance lipid attachment and vesicle fusion and thus make bilayer
formation occur in the QCM-D under particular conditions other than
those for an NR setup. The flow rate has also proved important for
successful bilayer formation and, since the dimensions of the neutron
cell and the QCM-D cell are different, the mass transfer to the surface
will be higher in the smaller QCM-D cell under the experimental conditions
necessary for NR.

We also succeeded in forming both 10 and 25%
PG bilayers in the QCM-D using the standard setup (peristaltic pump,
dragging mode at 0.1 mL/min). In this case, however, the experiments
were notoriously more difficult to reproduce due to the formation
of air bubbles at high temperatures (even after degassing) and the
deposition of vesicles on the surface due to aggregation and phase
separation rather than due to surface related phenomena. We have previously
demonstrated the importance of surface directionality to differentiate
between surface phenomena and deposition to surfaces due to phase-separation
processes and the effect of gravitation.36 Therefore, using the QCM-D upside down might be advantageous for
studies where aggregation occurs in the bulk as well as the use of
higher flow rates.

Conclusions
In summary, we have,
by vesicle fusion, formed and for the first time structurally characterized
SLBs made of POPG and POPE, which can be considered as better mimics
of simple bacterial membranes. Indeed, antimicrobial compounds have
been reported to differentiate between PE and PC lipids in the past37 and this is particularly important in discriminating
between mammalian cells, Gram-positive bacteria, and Gram-negative
bacteria. Our experiments suggest that a PE:PG vesicle concentration
of 0.1 mg/mL in 3 mM CaCl2 introduced at continuous flow
by a syringe pump at a rate of 1 mL/min at 50 °C are the optimal
conditions for bilayer formation. The time needed to achieve full
coverage depends on the amount of PG in the vesicle preparation, as
long as a critical CaCl2 concentration is used (which is
just above 2 mM CaCl2). It is important that the flow is
kept constant for as long as it is needed to achieve full coverage
(15–20 or 50–55 min for 10 or 25 mol % PG, respectively)
and that the lipid suspension is rinsed off as soon as full coverage
is obtained to avoid excess lipid vesicle adsorption. From a stability
point of view, it is also desirable to work with a high flow rate
and low vesicle concentration due to the propensity of vesicle aggregation
(and eventually phase separation) in the bulk solution after the addition
of CaCl2. It is highly recommended to add the CaCl2 as a 1:1 dilution into freshly sonicated small unilamellar
vesicles immediately prior to introduction into the sample cell to
limit aggregation and premature vesicle fusion as DLS data indicate
that aggregation starts to take place within 5 min of mixing. Finally,
the structure of POPE–POPG bilayers is similar to those of
pure POPE bilayers (vesicle studies) with a small headgroup (5 Å)
and slightly thicker lipid cores as compared with POPC. There
seems to be considerably less thermal expansion for POPE–POPG
than for PC systems as subjecting the POPE–POPG bilayers to
temperatures below the Tm only leads to
a 1 Å thickening of the tail core and a 1 Å2 decrease
in the mean molecular area.

Materials and Methods
POPE and POPG
were bought from Avanti Lipids and used without further purification.
MQ H2O was used in all preparations, and D2O
(sigma) was provided by the neutron facility. CaCl2 was
bought from Sigma Aldrich. Lipids were mixed in chloroform to the
appropriate molar ratio using stocks of the individual lipids. The
organic solvent was dried under N2 flow and subjected to
vacuum for at least 1 h. Films were kept at −20 °C until
use. Lipid films were resuspended in MQ H2O (QCM-D) or
D2O (NR) to a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL and bath sonicated
for 1 h. Just prior to use, the lipid suspension was tip sonicated
for 5 min, 5 s on/off at 10% of the maximum power (50 W) using a Fisher
Scientific tip sonicator model FB50 and a tip model CL-18. Finally,
the vesicle suspension was mixed with equal volumes of CaCl2 having double the desired final concentration.

Neutron Reflection (NR)
Specular NR was used to analyze the structure of the SLB at the
solid/liquid interface. NR allows one to obtain structural information
perpendicular to the surface in a nondestructive manner. INTER, a
time-of-flight reflectometer at the ISIS neutron source (Didcot, U.K.),
was used in this study. An incident neutron beam, with a chosen wavelength
(λ), is directed on the solid/water interface and partially
reflected and refracted depending on the incident angle (θ)
and the wavelength (λ). The ratio between the incident and the
reflected beams (R) is then measured as a function
of the wavevector, which is defined as Q = 4π/λ sin θ.
To obtain detailed structural information, the isotopic contrast between
the molecules in the sample is important. The scattering length density
(SLD) determines the isotopic contrast and highlights different components
in the sample. The SLD profile is described by the sum of the coherent
scattering length bj multiplied
by the number of nuclei in a given volume nj (SLD = ∑jnjbj). By exchanging hydrogen with deuterium, the SLD
of a molecule increases and the isotropic contrast can be manipulated
to partially highlight specific parts of a molecule. In this study,
the isotropic contrast was achieved by exchanging the bulk solvent
with either D2O or H2O. The resolution was set
to Δλ/λ = 3% using two incident angles of 0.8 and
2.3°. Homemade solid/liquid flow cells were used and connected
to an HPLC pump. The area exposed to the neutron beam was 4.5 ×
6.5 cm2. All cell parts made of polyetheretherketone were
cleaned by bath sonication in 2% Hellmanex and MQ water. Silicon(111)
surfaces were cooked in piranha solution (H2SO4/H2O2 7:3) at 80 °C for 10 min followed
by extensive rinsing in MQ water. The data were analyzed using the
Motofit software, which uses the Abeles optical matrix method for
fitting reflectometry data of thin layers.38 Three layers were used to model the lipid bilayer: headgroup, tail,
headgroup. An additional layer was added between the SiO2 layer and the SLB to represent the solvent trapped in the roughness
of the substrate. To keep physically realistic models of lipid bilayers,
the lipids were restricted to maintain the same mean molecular area
(MMA) of the head and the tail 1  where d is the thickness
of the layer, ø is the volume fraction, and V is the volume of the headgroup or the tail. Since there are two
tails per lipid head group, the area of the tail is multiplied by
two. Error estimations associated with each fitted parameter were
obtained by varying each parameter individually until a significant
change in the χ2 values between the simulated NR
data and the experimental data was observed. Theoretical values of
the lipid components obtained from MD simulations are given in Supporting
Information Table S1.

Quartz Crystal
Microbalance with Dissipation (QCM-D)
Measurements were performed
using a Q-SENSE E4 system (Q-Sense, Sweden) connected to an HPLC pump
through the neutron cells. Silicon oxide sensor crystals, 50 nm (Q-Sense,
Sweden), were used. Cleaning protocols were used as specified by Q-Sense.
Prior to experiments, the fundamental frequency (5 MHz) and five overtones
(3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, and 11th) were found and recorded in MQ water.
The flow rate was set to 1 mL/min, and the temperature was controlled
as specified. A baseline was obtained in D2O prior to injection
of the vesicle solution. A constant flow of vesicles was maintained
until stable signals were obtained before rinsing with excess D2O. The QMC-D measurements were reproducible when running at
high flow rate and when flipping the instrument upside down. This
is due to less probability of air bubble formation in the QCM-D cell
as well as the lack of vesicle deposition due to aggregation and phase
separation in the bulk induced by calcium bridging of vesicles (Figure S1 gives DLS data for POPE–POPG
vesicles incubated with 1, 2, and 3 mM CaCl2 over time
and shows that vesicle aggregation occurs within minutes of mixing
the lipids with the calcium solution and stabilizes at around 10 min
for 10 mol % PG but takes longer for 25 mol % PG). Moreover, the lipid
solution should never be left standing in the cell without flow, but
should be rinsed with water right away after successful SLB deposition.
