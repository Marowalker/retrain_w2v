The formation of titanium dioxides,
such as rutile and anatase,
is known to proceed through the formation of a lepidocrocite-type
layered structure under hydrothermal conditions, but the nucleation
of this intermediate is still not understood well. Here, the nucleation
of lepidocrocite-type layered titanates under hydrothermal conditions
is observed by tracking the structural changes by in situ time-resolved
pair distribution function analyses. We found that titanate clusters
or corrugated layered prestructures having <1 nm domains with lepidocrocite-type
connectivity were formed even before thermal treatment in alkaline
aqueous solution. Upon thermal treatment, a two-dimensional layered
structure grew directly from the prestructure, not from the amorphous
polymeric hydroxide dissolved in the solution. Thus, we conclude that
the formation of the lepidocrocite-like prestructure is the key for
forming a layered titanate under hydrothermal conditions.

Introduction
Titanium dioxides,
such as anatase and rutile, are widely used
because of their low environmental impact and abundant resources.
In the chemical formation of titanium dioxides, an intermediate lepidocrocite-type
layered titanate often forms,1−3 but other intermediates have also
been observed under similar hydrothermal conditions.2,4 Better understanding of the nucleation/growth mechanism is of great
importance for titanite synthesis. However, more details, such as
the nucleation of the intermediates from precursor solutions, remain
to be clarified. Nucleation, an initiation step for forming a new
phase having a low free energy from a phase having a higher energy,
has been studied for decades, but a fundamental understanding has
still not been attained. Classical nucleation theory provides a rough
understanding of direct nucleation driven by thermal fluctuations,
whereas other mechanisms, including the formation of intermediate
clusters, often more accurately describe the phenomena.5,6 The overall processes are complicated; hence, a variety of mechanisms
might exist in reality. In particular, greater understanding of the
nucleation of solid products in solvents during chemical reactions,
which proceeds via the cleavage and formation of chemical bonds in
precursor compounds, is required.

To clarify the process of
nucleation in chemical synthesis, in
situ time-resolved analysis techniques, using energy/angular-dispersive
X-ray diffraction (XRD),7−14 an X-ray pair distribution function (PDF) analysis,4,15−17 and modified transmission electron microscopy (TEM),18,19 can be used. XRD is advantageous for determining the kinetics of
crystallization processes,20,21 a PDF analysis is useful
for clarifying the structural changes during nucleation and initial
growth,6 and TEM can track individual particles.
In particular, monitoring the trajectory of formation of products
is informative when examining nucleation. These in situ observations
can remove the effect of recovery processes, including quenching,
rinsing, and drying.

We observed the nucleation of titanates,
particularly the nucleation
and growth of the lepidocrocite-type structure, under hydrothermal
conditions by in situ X-ray total scattering analyses. In the total
scattering data, Bragg peaks clarify the growth of crystalline products
and PDFs reveal local-to-medium-range structural transformations,
particularly in the nucleation stage. PDFs are useful for determining
the structures of crystalline, nanocrystalline, and amorphous materials.14−16,22,23 They provide the distances and densities of atomic pairs ranging
from coordination spheres (obtained by X-ray absorption fine structure
(XAFS) analysis) to crystal structures. Thus, we investigated the
structural changes of titanium oxides under hydrothermal conditions
by analyzing in situ X-ray total scattering data.

Results and Discussion
First, we analyzed the final product formed by the hydrothermal
reaction of titanium isopropoxide in aqueous solution containing tetramethyl
ammonium hydroxide (TMAH). After the reaction at 160 °C under
microwave heating, the product was recovered from the solution and
crystallized by a purification procedure (details in the Materials
and Methods). Its composition was carefully determined as
[TiO2]·nH2O·m((CH3)4N) (n = 0.54
and m = 0.22) by elemental and thermogravimetric
analyses (Figure S1) and from the infrared
spectrum (Figure S2).

The structure
was determined by XRD (Figure 1a) and using the PDF (Figure 1b). The particles have a uniform size on
the order of 10 nm (Figure 2). The PDF data, particularly the relative intensity of the
peaks around 3.0 Å (assigned to the Ti–Ti distance in
edge-shared TiO6 octahedra) and 3.7 Å (assigned to
the Ti–Ti distance in corner-shared TiO6 octahedra),
suggest that the structure is a lepidocrocite-type titanate.1,3 The individual layers of the lepidocrocite-type titanate have orthorhombic
symmetry, which we confirmed from the result of high-resolution TEM
(Figure 2c). A titanate
with a lepidocrocite-type structure is known to crystallize in isomorphous
compounds with orthorhombic crystal structures having interlayer alkali-metal
cations,24,25 and thus we compared the experimental XRD
pattern with simulated patterns, such as those of lepidocrocite titanate
crystals of K0.8Ti1.73Li0.27O4 (KTLO) and H1.07Ti1.73O4 (HTO), using the structure information available in the literature.14 As shown in Figure S3, the XRD pattern for HTO is similar but not a close match to our
data. This is reasonable because our material contains TMAH molecules.
Since there is no reported crystal structure for lepidocrocite titanate
with TMAH, we solved the structure and refined it by the Rietveld
method, as described in the next paragraph.

analysis of the layered titanate crystals.

shows a fast Fourier transform pattern, which exhibits rectangular
symmetry.

As is often the case, we attempted
to solve the structure by the
direct method using the EXPO2014 program26 but were unsuccessful. Then, we employed the real-space method using
an initial structure model prepared by modifying the HTO-layered titanate
structure.14 We performed cycles of structure
modification and refinement using the Rietveld method while checking
the Fourier map showing the difference between the model and the electron
density map calculated from the XRD data. As a result, the space group
was determined to be P2, then the structure was further
refined by the Rietveld method (Figure 1a). The symmetry is lower than that of the typical
orthorhombic unit cell for lepidocrocite-type titanate27 because of the presence of tetrahedral TMAH
molecules rather than alkali-metal cations, such as K+.
The resultant structure is monoclinic (a = 5.939
Å, b = 7.588 Å, c = 23.651
Å, β = 103.857°, Rwp =
5.520, goodness-of-fit (GOF) = 0.727; structural information is available
in the Supporting Information). The GOF
value of less than 1.0 is considered to originate from the weak scattering
at high angles causing a low Rexp value
(7.593), and the fit itself is reasonably good. The mismatch found
at high angles is probably due to the model based only on isotropic
particle size because the integrated intensity for each peak appears
to match that of experimental data well. Since the aim of this data
analysis of the crystalline product is to determine the atomic arrangement
in detail, we used PDF analysis for the further structural refinement,
where the particle size effects are less dominant. The local structure
of the titanate was investigated through PDF refinement (Figures 1b and S4) using the PDFfit2 program28 (a = 5.944 (7) Å, b = 7.576 (9) Å, c = 23.56 (5) Å, β
= 103.33° (16), Rw = 23.7%, fitting
range = 1–30 Å; structural information is available in
the Supporting Information) and is illustrated
in Figure 1c. Note
that the coordinates of TMAH molecules were fixed to the positions
refined by the XRD analysis because their contribution to the PDF
was not significant, as shown in Figure S4b. The crystal structure consists of two layers of lepidocrocite-type
titanate with interlayer water and TMAH molecules. We clarified that
the reaction formed a lepidocrocite-type layered titanate.

As
discussed above, we clarified that the reaction yielded a lepidocrocite-type
layered titanate from the precursor solution. Next, we analyzed the
reaction route by in situ time-resolved X-ray total scattering experiments. Figure 3 shows the time-resolved
in situ X-ray total scattering used to investigate structural transformation
proceeding under hydrothermal conditions. The solution was homogeneously
heated from room temperature (RT) to 160 °C (5 °C steps
and 5 min per step holding time) using microwave (Figures 3b and S5). Since the intense peak around 2.5° is mostly associated
with the solvent molecules, we subtracted it using the data for the
solution without titanate (Figure S6),
and thus obtained Figure 3c, which clearly illustrates the growth of Bragg peaks. The
peak at 3.28° grows even at 48 °C, and other peaks (e.g.,
4.07°) appear at higher temperatures. Note that these two peaks
are assigned to the in-plane diffraction peaks of the layered titanate
structure (cf. Figures 1 and 4c).

Figure 3 In situ X-ray total scattering measurements
performed to investigate
nucleation of titanate under hydrothermal conditions. (a) Two-dimensional
(2D) data of time-dependent total scattering data (λ = 0.10790
Å). The scattering from the glass vial and air background was
subtracted. The sample was kept at RT for 10 min and then heated up
to 160 °C (VT). (b) Temperature and pressure measured during
the X-ray experiments. (c) Selected profiles of the scattering data
recorded at different times (RT: 0 min; 48 °C: 19 min; 86 °C:
39 min; 154 °C: 78 min; 160 °C: 100, 119, 159, 319, and
419 min; RT: 517 min from bottom to top). The solvent scattering data
at the same temperature were subtracted. The hkl values,
200 and 020, are based on the structure model of the crystalline product
analyzed at room temperature.

Figure 4 Time-dependent PDF data. (a) Two-dimensional plot of time-dependent
in situ PDFs. (b) Selected one-dimensional plots shown with the ex
situ PDF for the crystalline product. The total scattering intensity
from the solvent was subtracted and then the remaining intensity was
converted into PDFs. Ten frames (or 10 min) of data were integrated
for the RT data and the data obtained at 160 °C (85–95
and 470–480 min). One frame of data was used for 50 and 90
°C. The same Q range (2.0–18.9 Å–1) was used for the Fourier transform except that for
the crystalline sample (1.6–18.9 Å–1).

During the thermal treatment at
160 °C, these peaks grew and
other peaks assigned to out-of-plane diffraction appeared at lower
angles. In particular, the peaks below 0.7°, assigned to stacking
direction (the c axis in Figure 1c), shifted from 0.7 to 0.59°, which
is close to the angle of 0.54° (002 diffraction from the crystalline
product at RT, Figure 1). These results indicate that the stacking of layers proceeds. The
solution changed from translucent to white during holding at 160 °C,
but the solution became translucent again when cooled (Figure S7). This observation is consistent with
the diffraction pattern (top, Figure 3c), which only contains in-plane diffraction peaks
at low temperatures. This fact indicates lower solubility of the layered
titanite at elevated temperatures, indicating negative entropy for
the dissolution of the compound in water, which may be due to strong
hydration of the layered titanate or TMAH molecules, as is known for
Ca(OH)2 and Li2CO3.

The in
situ XRD data suggest the formation and growth of the layered
titanate structure even during the period when the temperature was
increased from RT to 160 °C (in ∼80 min). To acquire further
understanding of this process, the scattering data were converted
into PDFs by a Fourier transform, where the solvent signal was subtracted,
as shown in Figure 3c. We calculated the PDFs for the titanate compounds after subtracting
the intensity of the solvent measured at the same temperature (Figure 4). The solvent contained
water molecules and TMAH as well as isopropanol formed from titanium
isopropoxide. The titanate species were removed before adding TMAH.
Thus, the total scattering data from this solution can be regarded
as identical to that from the solvent phase in the sample solution.
Since the titanate forms solid-state structures, this subtraction
is considered to remove the solvent signal effectively, as reported
for nanoparticles.29Figure 4a shows the time dependence of the reduced
PDF during the hydrothermal reaction. The peak positions are almost
constant and identical to those of the lepidocrocite structure (Figure 4b). The structure
within 20 Å did not significantly change, except in the initial
15 min, where the as-prepared sample grew abruptly after starting
the thermal treatment at 10 min. The relative PDF data show this change
more clearly, as shown in Figure S8 (details
are available in the Supporting Information). This is consistent with
the XRD results and no additional phase was found; thus, the structural
change proceeds without forming an intermediate structure, that is,
the structure transformation is direct.

The lepidocrocite structure
grown after the thermal treatment (e.g.,
“RT (cooled)” in Figure 4b) has a PDF peak assigned to Ti–Ti pairs in
edge-shared TiO6 octahedra around 3.0 Å and one assigned
to Ti–Ti pairs in corner-shared TiO6 octahedra around
3.5 Å.3 Consistent with the crystalline
product, the relative intensities of these peaks indicate the formation
of lepidocrocite layers, which have more edge-sharing TiO6 octahedra than anatase, brookite, and rutile.3 The PDF peak around 1.4 Å is too short for Ti–O
bonds30 and is assigned to the C–N
distance in TMAH and probably to a termination ripple. Note that a
peak corresponding to Ti=O double bonds may be observable around
1.6 Å,31 but the absence of a peak
in the infrared spectrum around 1000 cm–1 rules
out the formation of double bonds (Figure S9). The peak at 1.95 Å is assigned to Ti–O nearest neighbors.

The PDF was analyzed by curve fitting using an isolated nanosheet
model, as shown in Figures 5 and S10, where an orthorhombic
unit cell in the Pmmn space group was used (a = 2.987 (3) Å, b = 3.803 (3) Å, c = 100 Å, Rw = 16.5% in
the range from 1 to 20 Å; the large c value
was used to simulate the isolated structure; two Ti sites and four
O sites). The lattice constants a and b are almost half of those of the crystalline product shown in Figure 1c, where the interlayer
TMAH molecules lower the symmetry of the crystal structure. Note that
we did not include the interlayer TMAH molecules found in the crystalline
products because their contribution was not significant even in the
crystalline product although they were considered to exist around
the titanate layers. Thus, the model does not simulate the peak at
1.4 Å, which is assigned to C–N distance though it might
be a termination ripple of the Fourier transform. Moreover, the model
has an empty space along the c axis to simulate in-plane
atomic correlation only using PDFfit2, but this model cannot properly
simulate the background of the PDF, which reflects averaged number
density of atoms. Thus, we simulated background of the PDF separately
as shown in Figure S10, subtracted it from
the experimental PDF, and then performed the curve fitting using PDFfit2.

Figure 5 (a) PDF

measured at RT. (b, c) Lepidocrocite-type layered titanate structure

Looking closely at the PDF of
the titanate in the as-prepared solution,
we found that the peak positions were slightly different from those
in the grown lepidocrocite-layered titanate. First, there are no peaks
above 7 Å (Figure 4b), meaning that the structure is tiny or highly corrugated. We simulated
the PDFs of these typical TiO2 crystals and layered hydroxide
crystals (H2Ti2O3, H2Ti3O7, and lepidocrocite-type TiO2) as
shown in Figure S11. It is apparent that
the Ti–Ti pairs in corner-shared TiO6 octahedra
are richer in the titanate in the as-prepared solution than those
in typical TiO2 crystals of anatase, rutile, and brookite.
We confirmed that the lepidocrocite-type TiO2 PDF most
closely matched the experimental PDF (Figure S11f). The experimental PDF was fitted with the lepidocrocite structure
with the highest symmetry (Pmmn space group; a = 3.040(8), b = 3.833(12) Å, c = 100 Å, Rw = 27.7% in
the range from 1 to 15 Å) using the PDFfit2 program (Figure S10b).28 There
is an obvious mismatch between the experimental and simulated PDFs,
suggesting that there are short-range chemical orders. For example,
the titanate has a peak located around 3.7 Å (assigned to Ti–Ti
in corner-shared octahedra), which is at a longer distance and broader
than that in the typical lepidocrocite structure, whereas the peak
at 4.9 Å (assigned to Ti–Ti along the diagonal direction)
is at a shorter distance.

For the further analysis of the PDF
data, we used a 2 × 2
× 1 supercell of the model (P1 space group;
8 Ti sites and 16 O sites). Performing the fitting with PDFfit228 for the 24 atoms in the P1
space group can collapse the structure during the least-squares fitting
of the atomic coordinates, and thus we used our own program to modify
the atomic coordinates through the random movement of one atom within
a distance of 0.1 Å under the structural restraints of the bond
lengths (Ti–O: 1.8–2.6 Å; Ti–Ti: >2.8
Å).
We used PDFfit2 to simulate the PDF based on the structural model
with fixed coordinates, and then we judged the acceptance or rejection
of the structure modification on the basis of the R value exported from PDFfit2. Performing these cycles of structure
modification and evaluation of the curve fitting is a type of reverse
Monte Carlo simulation using a large-scale structure model. This can
also be considered as the simulated annealing method, which is often
used in XRD analysis because of the use of a structure model of a
unit cell.32 Since the surface O atoms
coordinate to only two Ti atoms and thus are considered not to be
well restrained by the data, we fixed their coordinates. This model
can effectively simulate the experimental PDF (P1
space group; a = 6.169(13), b =
7.68(2) Å, c = 100 Å, Rw = 16.1% in the range from 1 to 15 Å), meaning that
the titanate is a lepidocrocite-type structure having relaxed atom
positions within the restraints. It is apparent that the Ti positions
are disordered (Figure 6c). Thus, we consider that this disordered prestructure of the lepidocrocite
grows to form larger 2D lepidocrocite structures upon thermal treatment.

solution measured at RT. (b–d) Lepidocrocite-type layered titanate
structure model (2 × 2 × 1 supercell in P1 space group).

Conclusions
This
work has revealed that (i) titanium isopropoxide forms segregated
tiny cluster-like or disordered corrugated lepidocrocite-type structures
with <7 Å domains in alkaline aqueous solution (pH = 14),
(ii) these prestructures directly form lepidocrocite-layered titanate
without forming intermediates upon thermal treatment (as shown in Figure 7), (iii) the structural
transformation commences immediately after starting the thermal treatment,
(iv) further treatment results in gradual growth of the layers and
their stacking commences, and (v) the layered structure dispersed
in the solution is slightly different from that in crystals having
interlayer TMAH. Thus, we conclude that the formation of the lepidocrocite-like
prestructure is the key for forming the layered titanate under hydrothermal
conditions.

domains become ordered and grow.

Materials and Methods
Design of in Situ X-ray Measurements
We have developed
a system, in which hydrothermal/solvothermal reactions are monitored
by in situ X-ray scattering as well as a pressure sensor and a temperature
sensor (Figure S5). The penetration of
X-ray was ensured by using synchrotron high-energy X-rays (115 keV),
sufficient time resolution was obtained using a flat panel detector,
and a good signal-to-noise ratio was ensured by developing a data-processing
program. The apparatus was designed on the basis of the criteria for
successful in situ diffraction measurements under the hydrothermal
conditions summarized by Walton and O’Hare, in brief, (i) a
good signal-to-noise ratio (or high intensity of Bragg peaks relative
to the diffuse scattering), (ii) the sufficient penetration of X-rays
through containers, and (iii) sufficient time resolution to discuss
the kinetics.33

Microwave Synthesis
The chemical reactions were carried
out under hydrothermal conditions using a Biotage Initiator microwave
reactor. Five milliliters of solution was placed in a dedicated glass
vial (2–5 mL). We chose microwave heating because it directly
heats the solvent (not through thermal conduction), that is, reactions
are considered to proceed homogeneously. The reactor was modified
by forming holes in the metallic compartment and removing the Teflon
inner walls to allow X-rays to pass through the glass vial with the
minimum background intensity associated with the reactor. The temperature
of the solution ∼1 cm below the liquid level was monitored
by an infrared sensor, whereas the solution ∼1.5 cm above the
bottom was irradiated by X-rays. The solution was mixed with a magnetic
stir bar at 600 rpm. Note that this operation requires careful calibration
of the system. The temperature and pressure in the vial were monitored
using the sensors of the reactor, and the color of the liquid was
monitored using a camera. We investigated whether the structures of
the final products are identical in the microwave heating experiments
and conventional heating using autoclaves through ex situ XRD experiments.

Chemicals
Titanium isopropoxide (0.67 g) was mixed
in 6.68 mL of TMAH (12.5%, Nacalai Tesque; diluted with pure water)
in the glass vial of the microwave reactor. The pH value was constant
at 14.0 before and after the microwave reactions. For the preparation
of the dry product, the titanate was precipitated by adding isopropanol
into the solution, filtered, rinsed with isopropanol, and then dried.

Elemental Analysis
Elemental analysis was performed
using a Hitachi SPS3520UV-DD inductively coupled plasma optical emission
spectrometer for Ti, using a LECO TC436 elemental analyzer for O in
oxides and using a LECO CS-444LS analyzer for C. The obtained contents
were Ti (44.0 wt %), O (34 ± 1 wt %), C (10.4 ± 0.2 wt %),
and N (1.5 ± 0.1 wt %). Note that these measurements reflect
the composition of nonvolatile components, giving the Ti to O atomic
ratio of Ti/O = 1.00:1.99. Because this measurement of the N content
is less reliable than those of the other elements, we performed a
CHN analysis using a PerkinElmer PE2400II instrument and obtained
contents of C (10.0 wt %), H (3.4 wt %), and N (2.8 wt %), giving
a molar ratio of C0.83H3.4N0.20.
The composition was thus determined as [TiO2]·nH2O·m((CH3)4N) (n = 0.54 and m = 0.22).
The content of TMAH was constant even after purification through the
recrystallization process.

In Situ PDF Measurements
A rapid-acquisition
pair distribution
function analysis was carried out at the BL08W beamline in SPring-8.
The X-ray scattering data were collected on a PerkinElmer flat panel
detector using monochromated X-rays at 115 keV. The data were recorded
every 1 min by averaging 60 frames of image data collected with an
exposure of 1.0 s per frame. The optics, including the beam center
coordinates, the tilt of the detector, and the sample-to-detector
distance, were calibrated using image data obtained for CeO2 (NIST 674B) packed in a Kapton capillary (ϕ 1 mm) fixed at
the center of the glass vial loaded in the microwave reactor.

The data for the solvent only (Figure S6) were obtained for a solution prepared by adding titanium isopropoxide
to pure water, extracting the liquid phase, and then adding TMAH solution
to the solution. This solution contains water, TMAH, and isopropanol
at the same concentrations as those in the titanate solution used
for the hydrothermal synthesis.

Ex Situ X-ray Measurements
X-ray total scattering data
were collected on a Rigaku RAXIS-IV imaging plate detector at the
BL10XU beamline in SPring-8 (λ = 0.19909 Å, determined
using CeO2). The exposure time was 600 s. The sample was
packed in a Kapton capillary (ϕ 1 mm). After roughly determining
the structure using this PDF data (Qmax = 20.0 Å–1), further analysis was performed
using the data collected at the BL08W beamline in SPring-8 (λ
= 0.1076 Å, Qmax = 29.0 Å–1). In addition to these PDF data, synchrotron XRD
data were collected using PILATUS 100K semiconductor detectors at
the BL5S2 beamline (beam size = 0.5 mm × 0.5 mm, λ = 1.29945
Å) at 25 °C. The crystal structure was determined using
the EXPO2014 program.

Data Processing
We used the PIXIA
program to convert
image data to one-dimensional profiles through mathematical noise
filtration and calculations based on X-ray scattering physics (details
are available in the Supporting Information; the program was developed as part of the Orochi Project and will
be available from the National Institute for Materials Science).34 This is because the resolution of in situ and/or
time-resolved measurements is likely to get worse than the ex situ
resolution owing to the lower signal-to-noise ratio, and it may not
be possible to monitor the trace of a structural change, which is
likely hidden by noise. Details are available in the Supporting Information
(Figures S12–S17 and related explanations).

To monitor the structural changes during synchrotron measurements,
we used an extended concept of differential PDFs, referred to as “relative
PDFs”, to detect even faint changes associated with the structural
transformation in the nucleation stage. These relative PDFs are useful
for monitoring structural changes during the measurements. The differential
PDFs are the pair correlation functions between all atoms and a particular
chemical species22 and are used to discuss
changes in the chemical species of interest. They are obtained by
calculation of the difference between two sets of total scattering
data or PDFs that are measured at different concentrations or the
scattering factors of particular chemical species.22,35−37

In contrast to these intended and selective
modulations, it is
difficult to know the changes in the chemical species in reactions
in advance, and thus accurate differential PDFs cannot be obtained.
However, we consider that a simple calculation of the relative values
of PDFs (details are available in the Supporting Information) from the total scattering data is useful for detecting
a trace of a structural change even without accurate normalization
using scattering factors for the chemical species assumed to change
in the reactions. These relative PDFs are basically similar to differential
PDFs and are easily calculated with minimal noise to monitor the reactions
during total scattering experiments, although the amplitude may be
less meaningful owing to the normalization. Considering the fact that
the normalization in extended X-ray absorption fine structures (EXAFS)
is often based on a spline function, the normalization for the relative
PDFs is acceptable.

Other Measurements
Simultaneous
thermogravimetric analysis
and differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) were performed using a
Hitachi HT-Seiko Instrument Exter 6300 instrument (5 °C min–1, RT to 600 °C in air). Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy was carried out using a Thermo Fisher Scientific Nicolet
4700 spectrometer in the transmission mode (KBr pellets).
