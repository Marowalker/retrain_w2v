The
visible fluorescent chromophoric moiety present in the water-soluble
photoactive yellow protein (PYP) of Ectothiorhodospira
halophila is p-hydroxycinnamic acid
linked to the cysteine residue (Cys-69) by a thioester bond and it
controls the key photoinduced biological processes of the host organism.
In the present work, we have synthesized and characterized three structurally
different thiophenyl esters [viz., p-hydroxycinnamic-thiophenyl
ester (1), p-N,N-dimethylaminocinnamic-thiophenyl ester (2), and S-phenyl-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-(phenylthio)propanethioate
(3)] in addition to a novel (to the best of our knowledge)
stilbene-type olefinic compound, N1,N1,N2,N2-tetramethyl-1,2-bis(phenylthio)ethene-1,2-diamine (4), under the same reaction condition. All of these four compounds
showed characteristic and distinguishable chromophoric/fluorophoric
behavior in ethanol and also at pH 7.4. However, we have observed
that the intrinsic chromophoric/fluorophoric activities of (1) and (2) were greatly influenced during their
interactions with calf-thymus DNA, studied by a range of spectroscopic
and physicochemical measurements. We have also applied density functional
theory [B3LYP, 6-311G+(d,p)]-based method to get optimized
structures of (1) and (2), which were explored
further for molecular docking studies to understand their mode of
interaction with DNA. The present study opens up their possible applications
as fluorescence probes for biomacromolecules like DNA in future.

1 Introduction
Small
molecules have wide spectrum of biological activities. As
a cell signaling chemical entity or as a drug, a small molecule can
regulate a specific biological process by binding to a particular
biotarget, like a specific protein or nucleic acid.1 Small molecules, e.g., organic dyes or drugs having fluorophoric/chromophoric
activity show intense change in their spectral behavior when they
bind to a specific biomacromolecule, which can be a protein, enzyme,
or DNA. This change of spectral pattern of the small molecules is
often indicative of their mode of interaction with that particular
biomacromolecule.2−10 Hence, this type of small molecules are being extensively explored
as important research tools to probe a biotarget (i.e., biomacromolecule
regulating a particular biological process) and also for the development
of novel therapeutic drugs as well as effective diagnostic protocols.1,11 It is a highly cherished research goal for the scientists to develop
novel, nontoxic, photostable, and easily synthesizable small-molecule-based
fluoroprobe for a specific biotarget. Plethora of organic compounds
is put into trials for this,1,11 and in this context,
fluorescent thioesters, especially α,β-unsaturated thioesters,
are highly relevant.12−17

In living cells, several enzymatic reactions are triggered
by such
thioester derivatives.13,18 On the other hand, thioesters
are often considered as better choices over oxoesters and used as
vital synthetic intermediates in various important organic transformations,
viz., biosynthesis of natural products.13,19,20 Apart from this, α,β-unsaturated thioesters
are found in the photoactive yellow protein (PYP) of Ectothiorhodospira halophila.15,21 The visible fluorescent chromophoric moiety present in this water-soluble
small chromoprotein is p-hydroxycinnamic acid, which
is linked to the cysteine residue (Cys-69) by a thioester bond and
controls the key photoinduced biological processes of the host organism.15,22 Moreover, photochromic α,β-unsaturated thioesters (e.g., p-hydroxycinnamic-thiophenyl ester) are studied extensively
as model compounds to understand the mechanism of various photochemical
reactions, and such compounds are explored nowadays for the development
of memory and optical devices.16

In the present work, we have synthesized three structurally different
thioester derivatives, p-hydroxycinnamic-thiophenyl
ester [or (E)-S-phenyl-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)prop-2-enethioate]
(1), p-N,N-dimethylaminocinnamic-thiophenyl
ester [or (E)-S-phenyl-3-(4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)prop-2-enethioate]
(2), and S-phenyl-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-(phenylthio)propanethioate
(3) in addition to a novel (to the best of our knowledge)
olefinic type of compound, substituted with amine and thiophenyl groups,
i.e., N1,N1,N2,N2-tetramethyl-1,2-bis(phenylthio)ethene-1,2-diamine
(4) under the same reaction condition (Figure 1 and Scheme 1). Each of these compounds showed characteristic
chromophoric/fluorophoric behavior in ethanol and also at pH 7.4 (physiological
pH) (Tris–HCl buffer medium) [results are shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information, pp S3 and
S4)].

ester (2), and N1,N1,N2,N2-tetramethyl-1,2-bis(phenylthio)ethene-1,2-diamine (4).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of (1–4)
p-Hydroxycinnamic-thiophenyl
ester (1), p-N,N-dimethylaminocinnamic-thiophenyl ester (2), S-phenyl-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-(phenylthio)propanethioate
(3), and N1,N1,N2,N2-tetramethyl-1,2-bis(phenylthio)ethene-1,2-diamine (4).

We have explored the characteristic
chromophoric/fluorophoric behavior
of compounds (1) and (2) for probing the
biomacromolecule, DNA, the fundamental genetic material regulating
the life processes. The intrinsic fluorescence activities of p-hydroxycinnamic-thiophenyl ester (1) and p-N,N-dimethylaminocinnamic-thiophenyl
ester (2) were found to be strongly dependent on their
interactions with calf-thymus DNA (ctDNA). We have optimized the structures
of (1) and (2) by applying a density functional
theory (DFT) [B3LYP, 6-311G+(d,p)]-based method, and their
mode of interaction was studied with the help of various spectroscopic
and physicochemical techniques and molecular docking studies, using
DFT-based optimized structures of (1) and (2).

2 General Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
All of the reagents used
for the synthesis of compounds (1–4) were of AR grade (E Merck). Solvents were dried and distilled prior
to their use. In all of the experiments, Milli-Q (Milli-Q academic
with 0.22 mm Milli pack-40) water was used as per the requirement.
Calf-thymus DNA (ctDNA) of molecular weight 8.4 MDa (SRL, India) was
used as the model DNA for studying DNA-binding interactions of the
synthesized compounds (1) and (2). Reagents
used for the biocompatibility assay are of molecular biology (MB)
grade, and details of these reagents are given in the Supporting Information (p S21).

For this
study, a stock solution of ctDNA was prepared by dissolving solid
ctDNA (sodium salt) in Tris–HCl buffer (10 mM, pH 7.4) (SRL,
India) containing 0.1 mol L–1 NaCl solution and
stored at 4 °C for further use. The purity of ctDNA was checked
spectrophotometrically by measuring the ratio of its maximum absorbance
at λmax values 260 and 280 nm, i.e., A260/A280. A value of A260/A280 ≈
1.87 was observed, which denoted that ctDNA used was sufficiently
free from protein. The concentration of ctDNA stock solution calculated
from its maximum absorbance at 260 nm (A260) and εctDNA (6600 L mol–1 cm–1) data was found to be 3.95 × 10–3 M.7,8

All other reagents for the DNA-binding
studies were of molecular
biology (MB) grade (SRL, India), and these regents were used as they
were purchased without any further purification. However, purity of
all of the reagents used for the present study was routinely checked
either spectrophotometrically or by thin-layer chromatography (TLC)
on silica gel GF254 precoated plates using appropriate
eluting solvent systems.

2.2 Method of Synthesis of
Thioester Derivatives
(1–4)
p-Hydroxycinnamic
acid (600 mg, 1 equiv, 3.65 mmol) was dissolved in 5 mL of dichloromethane
(DCM). The temperature of this reaction mixture was maintained at
0 °C, and oxalyl chloride (0.93 mL, 3 equiv, 10.97 mmol) was
added to it in a dropwise manner. To this reaction mixture, dimethylformamide
(DMF) (0.28 mL, 1 equiv, 3.65 mmol) was added at 0 °C and mixed
thoroughly. After that, the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature
(r.t.) for 2 h. The progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC
of the reaction mixture at regular intervals of time. After the completion
of the reaction, the reaction mixture was subjected to evaporation
under reduced pressure to get a concentrated mass, which was diluted
with a little amount (∼1.5 mL) of DCM, and triethylamine (Et3N) (1.53 mL, 3 equiv, 11.85 mmol) and thiophenol (PhSH) (0.807
mL, 2 equiv, 7.90 mmol) were added to it simultaneously and mixed
properly by keeping the temperature of the reaction mixture at 0 °C.
This reaction mixture was stirred for 12 h at r.t. After the completion
of the reaction (as monitored by TLC), the reaction mixture was diluted
with DCM and workup was done with aqueous NaHCO3 solution.
The organic part was separated, and the solvent was evaporated under
reduced pressure, whereby a gummy mass was obtained. This was subjected
to column chromatography over silica gel (mesh 100–200), and
the column was eluted with ethyl acetate (EA) and petroleum ether
(PE, 60–80 °C) solvent mixture, whereby we have got four
products: p-hydroxycinnamic-thiophenyl ester (1) (30–40% EA/PE), p-N,N-dimethylaminocinnamic-thiophenyl ester (2) (15–20%
EA/PE), S-phenyl-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-(phenylthio)propanethioate
(3) (75–90% EA/PE), and N1,N1,N2,N2-tetramethyl-1,2-bis(phenylthio)ethene-1,2-diamine
(4) (2–5% EA/PE).

Structures of (1)−(4) were confirmed on the basis
of physicochemical studies, spectroscopy (1H and 13C NMR, IR, liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS)),
and single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) [for (1),
(2), and (4) only] data. Single-crystal
XRD patterns of (1), (2), and (4) are shown in Figure 1. NMR spectra were recorded on a 400 MHz Bruker AVANCE-400 NMR spectrometer
with CDCl3 or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-d6 as solvents and tetramethylsilane as the internal standard.
XRD experiments were done as per standard procedure, and relevant
experimental details are given in Supporting Information (pp S5–S9).

2.4 Instrumentation
and Methods
2.4.1 Molecular Docking Study
Molecular
docking studies were done to understand the nature of intermolecular
interactions between the thioester derivatives p-hydroxycinnamic-thiophenyl
ester (1) or p-N,N-dimethylaminocinnamic-thiophenyl ester (2) and ctDNA. We have used Molecular Graphics Laboratory (MGL) and
AutoDock Vina tools to set up and perform blinded docking studies
between (1) or (2) and ctDNA.23 The crystal structure of B-DNA (protein data
bank (PDB) ID: 1BNA) was used for the docking study. This was downloaded from protein
data bank (PDB) prior to the docking of either (1) or
(2) with ctDNA. Water molecules were subtracted from
the DNA PDB file and polar hydrogen atoms were added to the DNA molecule.
Receptor (ctDNA) and ligand files [for (1) and (2)] were prepared using AutoDock. Before that, we have done
DFT-based optimization of the structures of the ligands [(1) and (2)] using Gaussian 09 package. B3LYP exchange
correlation functional together with standard 6-311G+(d,p)
basis sets24,25 was used for DFT calculations
(Supporting Information, pp S13–S16).

In each case, the DNA was fixed in a grid box of the dimension
74 × 52 × 92. The grid spacing was set at 0.375 Å.
The center of the grid was fixed up at 15.63, 19.75, and 10.08 Å.
Lamarckian genetic algorithm modules available with AutoDock were
employed to perform the ligand docking calculations. The default settings
available with AutoDock program were chosen to assign other parameters.8,26 In each case of the docking of (1) or (2) with ctDNA, the lowest energy docked conformation according to
the AutoDock scoring function was selected as the binding mode.

Python Molecular Viewer software (Stefano Forli, Olson Molecular
Graphics Laboratory, The Scripps Research Institute, CA) was used
to observe the output of the AutoDock studies.

2.4.2 Steady-State UV–Vis Absorption Spectroscopic
Studies
UV–vis absorption spectra of all of the synthesized
compounds (1–4) in ethanol and Tris–HCl
buffer (10 mM, pH 7.4) medium were recorded on a dual-beam UV–vis
spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, Lambda 35) in the wavelength range
of 200–600 nm. The interactions of either (1)
or (2) with ctDNA were also studied with the help of
UV–vis spectroscopy. Tris–HCl buffer (10 mM, pH 7.4)
was used as the reference solution in all of the studies of ctDNA–compound
interaction. In each case of the test compounds [(1)
or (2)], the stock solution (1 mM) was prepared in EtOH.
In a typical interaction study, specific volume of this stock solution
[0.04 and 0.16 mL for (1) and (2), respectively]
was added to 2.5 mL of Tris–HCl buffer in a 1.0 cm quartz cuvette
and mixed thoroughly. In each case of (1) and (2), this test solution was allowed to stand for 5 min. After
this time interval, the respective test solution was titrated spectrophotometrically
by the successive addition of 3.95 mM of ctDNA solution. In case of
(1), the volume of ctDNA solution added each time was
2 μL, whereas 5 μL of ctDNA was added each time to (2). The final concentration of ctDNA in test solution varied
from 0 to 0.07 mM for (1) and 0 to 0.08 mM for (2). The concentrations of (1) and (2) or ctDNA used for the present study were optimized after several
trials. In all of the cases, the volume effect was considered to be
negligible. All of the UV–vis absorption measurements were
performed at 25 °C. The final concentration of EtOH in the test
solution was negligible (<1%).

2.4.3 Steady-State
Fluorescence Spectroscopic
Measurements
Fluorescence spectra of compounds (1) and (2) in both EtOH and Tris–HCl buffer (10
mM, pH 7.4) media were recorded using PerkinElmer spectrophotometer
of model no. LS55. Fluorescence emission spectra of all of the experimental
solutions were recorded in the wavelength range of 300–540
nm with an excitation wavelength (λex) of 280 nm,
and slit width was fixed at 10 nm for both excitation and emission
beams.

We have also used steady-state fluorescence spectroscopic
method to study the interaction between ctDNA and the thioester derivative
(1) or (2). For this study, we have used
the same concentrations of ctDNA, (1) or (2) and Tris–HCl buffer, as discussed in the previous section.
All of the fluorescence measurements were done at 25 °C, and
we have observed that spectra of all of the test solutions remained
unchanged for a long time during which the experiments were done.
Hence, we can safely rule out the possibility of photodecomposition
of the experimental samples, which may give errors in the results.

2.4.4 Viscometric
Studies
Complexation/interaction
of ctDNA with a binding ligand [like thioester derivatives (1) and (2)] changes its viscosity. Hence, we
have done viscometric measurements of ctDNA solution in the presence
of (1) or (2) to study the interaction of
ctDNA with this type of ligands.

A Brookfield DV-II+ Pro viscometer,
thermostated at 25 °C was used for the present study. Tris–HCl
buffer (2.5 mL, 10 mM, pH 7.4) was used as reference solution. Different
volumes of (1) or (2) were added separately
into the viscometer by keeping ctDNA concentration fixed at 0.08 mM,
and for each addition, viscosity of the experimental solution was
measured. The concentration of (1) was varied within
the range of 0.01–0.08 mM in the experimental solution. The
same procedure was followed for (2).

The results
were expressed as relative viscosity (η/η0)
versus the ratio of concentrations of ligand [(1) or
(2)] to ctDNA (i.e., [(1)]/[ctDNA]
or [(2)]/[ctDNA]). Here, η and η0 denote the viscosities of ctDNA solution in the presence and absence
of ligand [either (1) or (2)], respectively.

2.4.5 Circular Dichroism (CD) Studies on the Binding
Interaction of ctDNA with p-Hydroxycinnamic-thiophenyl
Ester (1) or p-N,N-Dimethylaminocinnamic-thiophenyl Ester (2)
A JASCO J-815 spectropolarimeter (Jasco International
Co., Ltd., Hachioji, Japan) was used to record the CD spectra of all
of the sample solutions. A rectangular quartz cuvette of path length
1.0 cm was used in all of the measurements. All of the CD measurements
were done under inert and dry atmosphere, and for this, the optical
chamber of the CD spectropolarimeter was kept in the dry and nitrogen
atmosphere. The concentration of ctDNA was kept constant at 0.15 mM,
and the concentration of test compound [either (1) or
(2)] was varied. For both (1) and (2), the concentration range was 0–0.037 mM. CD spectra
were recorded in the wavelength range of 200–320 nm at a scan
speed of 100 nm min–1 and a band width of 1.0 nm.
The scans were collected and automatically averaged by the instrument.
All experiments were performed in Tris–HCl buffer (10 mM, pH
7.4) medium at 25 °C.

2.4.6 Cytotoxicity Assays of
(1)
and (2)
[3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide] (MTT) assays of (1) and (2) were
done to determine their cytotoxicity in human embryonic kidney cells
(HEK293). Furthermore, we have also tested the in vivo cytotoxicity
of these compounds using Saccharomyces cerevisiae 699 (MATa ade2-1 ura3-1 trp1-1 leu2-3, 112 his3-11, 15 ceul-100)
cells. Detailed methods for these assays are discussed in Supporting Information (p S21).

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Synthesis of p-Hydroxycinnamic-thiophenyl
Ester (1), p-N,N-Dimethylaminocinnamic-thiophenyl Ester (2), S-Phenyl-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-(phenylthio)propanethioate
(3) and N1,N1,N2,N2-Tetramethyl-1,2-bis(phenylthio)ethene-1,2-diamine (4) and Studies on Their Spectral Behavior
Usefulness
of thioesters either as synthetic intermediates or photoactive compounds
is very much dependent on their structures and therefore the synthetic
organic chemists are engaged in the development of synthetic protocols
for the thioesters having task-specific structures. One of the most
common methods for the synthesis of thioesters involves the reaction
of carboxylic acid or acid chloride with thiol in the presence of
a coupling agent, like dicyclohexyl carbodiimide (DCC)/N,N-dimethylaminopyridine.27,28 Various Lewis acid-catalyzed acylations of thiols are also common
methods for the synthesis of thioesters.29−31 In this context,
solid-supported of S-acylation reactions are noteworthy.32,33 Bandgar et al. reported Dess–Martin periodinane (DMP)-mediated
reaction of aldehyde and thiol to produce corresponding thioester
derivatives.34 TfOH-catalyzed direct thioesterification
of carboxylic acids using thiol was done by Iimura et al.35 Synthesis of thioesters via ruthenium-catalyzed
olefin cross-metathesis with thioacrylate was reported by van Zijl
et al.13 These two methods were also effective
in the synthesis of α,β-unsaturated thioesters.13,35 However, the synthesis of α,β-unsaturated thioesters
by the direct thioesterification of the α,β-unsaturated
acid, e.g., p-hydroxycinnamic acid, which itself
has functional groups susceptible toward the self-esterification,
is troublesome and protection of such functional group(s) (e.g., −OH
group) is required to get better yield.17

PYP chromophore analogue having an α,β-unsaturated
thioester moiety, i.e., p-hydroxycinnamic-thiophenyl
ester (1), was prepared by the coupling of p-hydroxycinnamic acid with thiophenol in the presence of DCC as the
coupling agent in DMF medium.15 Yoya et
al. synthesized p-hydroxycinnamic-thiophenyl ester
(1) by reacting (COCl)2/DMF-treated p-hydroxycinnamic ester with
thiophenate lithium salt at −30 °C in tetrahydrofuran
medium.12 Duran et al. have also reported
similar synthetic protocol for thioester derivatives.36 Unlike these methods, the present method is very simple
and cost-effective, and most importantly, we have obtained four structurally
and photochromically different S compounds under the same reaction
condition (Scheme 1). Among these, three are thioester analogues [p-hydroxycinnamic-thiophenyl ester (1), p-N,N-dimethylaminocinnamic-thiophenyl
ester (2), and S-phenyl-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-(phenylthio)propanethioate
(3)] and the fourth one, N1,N1,N2,N2-tetramethyl-1,2-bis(phenylthio)ethene-1,2-diamine
(4), is not a thioester compound but dimethylamine and
thiophenyl group-substituted olefinic (stilbene-type) compound (Scheme 1 and Figure 1).

Single-crystal XRD
patterns of (1), (2), and (4) are shown in Figure 1, and Tables S1–S3 (Supporting
Information, pp S5–S9) represent the corresponding
single-crystal XRD data and related experimental details for (1), (2), and (4). Selected bond
lengths and bond angles of the single-crystal XRD structures of (1), (2), and (4) are shown in Tables S4–S6, respectively (Supporting
Information, pp S10–S12).

The plausible mechanism of
formation of these four products (1–4) is shown in Scheme 2. Reaction of oxalyl chloride with DMF generates N,N-dimethylchloromethylene iminium chloride
(b), which on reaction with p-hydroxycinnamic
acid produces carboxymethylene iminium chloride intermediate (c). The thiophenate anion (d) (may be generated
by the reaction of thiophenol and triethylamine) reacts with (c) to give (1) (Scheme 2).12 However,
(1) may also react with (b) at its phenolic-OH
nucleophilic center to give intermediate (e). This intermediate
(e) may be decomposed by path (A) (shown by red line)
or by path (B) (shown by blue line) to give (f) or (2), respectively. There is another possibility that, (f) on reaction with another thiophenate moiety (d) gives (3). During these conversions, DMF may be regenerated,
which on reaction with excess oxalyl chloride present in the reaction
medium produces carboxymethylene iminium chloride intermediate (b) again. This iminium chloride (b) besides reacting
with p-hydroxycinnamic acid can also react with unreacted
(d) ions present in the reaction medium to generate (g), which on self-coupling may produce (4).

Scheme 2 Plausible Mechanism for the Formation of (1–4)
p-Hydroxycinnamic-thiophenyl
ester (1), p-N,N-dimethylaminocinnamic-thiophenyl ester (2), S-phenyl-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-(phenylthio)propanethioate
(3), and N1,N1,N2,N2-tetramethyl-1,2-bis(phenylthio)ethene-1,2-diamine (4).

Thus, this present simple and
low-cost method was found to be useful
in the synthesis and isolation of three different thioester analogues
with an S- and N-substituted olefinic compound simultaneously under
the same reaction condition. In future, this method may be suitability
scaled up to get better yield of each individual compound (1–4).

Among compounds (1–3), (1) and (2) were α,β-unsaturated
thiophenyl
esters having electron-releasing groups (−OH and −NMe2, respectively) at p-position of the cinnamic–aromatic
ring, which can control the chromophoric/fluorophoric behavior of
these compounds. On the other hand, (3) has a chlorine
substituent at p-position of cinnamic–aromatic ring, and it
has no olifinic unsaturation, rather the olefinic double bond of cinnamic
moiety is substituted here by the thiophenyl group. Thus, the conjugation
structure was lost in case of compound (3), which imposes
a different chromophoric character to this compound. On the other
hand, the S-analogue of stilbene type of compound (4)
may have future application as model compound for studying photochemical
(cis–trans) isomerization processes.

So, all of these
four compounds have distinguishable structural
features, for which each of these compounds may show characteristic
UV–vis and fluorescence spectroscopic behavior. To further
confirm this assumption, we have done UV–vis and fluorescence
spectroscopic studies of these compounds (1–4) in EtOH. We have also studied their spectral behavior at
pH 7.4 (which is considered to be physiological pH) using Tris–HCl
buffer. This was helpful to ascertain their usefulness as probe for
biomacromolecules in the in vivo system. The results are shown in Figure S1a(i–iv),b(i–iv) (Supporting
Information, pp S3 and S4).

It is noteworthy that each of these
four compounds showed distinct
and strong UV–vis and fluorescence behavior in EtOH as well
as in Tris–HCl buffer medium. This made us interested to explore
their chromophoric/fluorophoric responses in Tris–HCl buffer
medium of pH 7.4 in the present study of their interaction with biomacromolecule,
like DNA.

Before going through the details of the experimental
study on their
interaction with ctDNA, we have performed a preliminary screening
based on theoretical study, i.e., molecular docking.

3.2 Molecular Docking Studies To Investigate the
Interaction of Thiophenyl Esters [(1) or (2)] with ctDNA
Among the four synthesized thio compounds,
the core structure of (1) and (2) resembles
that of PYP chromophore and shows characteristic UV–vis and
fluorescence behavior at pH 7.4. So, these two compounds were subjected
to molecular docking studies to investigate their interaction with
ctDNA. However, we did not get any significant results with compounds
(3) and (4). So, these two compounds were
not further selected for other experimental studies on the ctDNA binding
interaction (discussed in a later section).

Results of the docking
study between (1) and ctDNA or (2) and ctDNA
are shown in Figure 2a,b respectively. The present molecular docking study gives an idea
about the two important parameters involved in this binding interaction
of either (1) and ctDNA or (2) and ctDNA:
(i) structure of the binding ligand [i.e., (1) or (2)] and the binding site(s) of the ligand and (ii) binding
sites of the biomacromolecule (i.e., ctDNA). These parameters not
only show strong influence on the binding profile and activity of
(1) and (2), but also control the binding
nature of the biomacromolecule, DNA. These are actually the factors
determining the efficacy of (1) or (2) as
fluorescent probe for biomacromolecules like DNA or as bioactive compounds
(e.g., drugs).

Figure 2 (a) Docking models of p-hydroxycinnamic-thiophenyl
ester (1) with ctDNA showing its binding at the minor
groove of the DNA: (i) atomic sphere model, (ii) ribbon model, and
(iii) close-up view (shown in line model); (iv) DFT [B3LYP 6-311G+(d,p)]-optimized structure of (1). (b) Docking
models of p-N,N-dimethylaminocinnamic-thiophenyl ester (2) with ctDNA
showing its binding at the minor groove of the DNA: (i) atomic sphere
model, (ii) ribbon model, and (iii) close-up view (shown in line model);
(iv) DFT [B3LYP 6-311G+(d,p)]-optimized structure of (2).

Results of docking studies
indicate huge deviation of structural
geometry of both thiophenyl esters (1) and (2) on interaction with DNA from their respective crystal structures
and also from their DFT-optimized structures, and the corresponding
molecular docking profiles are shown in Figure 2.

Docking studies revealed that both
thiophenyl esters (1) and (2) adopted fully
nonplanar geometry to accommodate
itself into the G–C-rich region of ctDNA and thus covalent
interaction, e.g., hydrogen-bonding interaction, played a vital role
in the binding of ctDNA and the thioester analogue (1) or (2), as shown in Figure 2.

We have also observed drastic changes
in some of the dihedral angles
and slight changes in bond lengths and bond angles in the ctDNA-docked
structures of (1) and (2) compared to their
free/unbound structures (Scheme 1 and Figure 1). These data are summarized in Tables S7a,b [for (1)] and S8a,b [for (2)] (Supporting Information, pp S17–S20).

The binding free energies (−ΔG) of
the ctDNA-docked structures of both (1) and (2) were calculated as 6.4 kcal mol–1. These results
support the existence of strong binding (possibly via noncovalent
interactions) between (1) and ctDNA and also between
(2) and ctDNA, as shown in Figure 2 and Tables S7a,b, and S8a,b, respectively (Supporting Information, pp S17–S20).
Although, it is apparent from Figure 2a,b that these thiophenyl esters, either (1) or (2), bind to the minor groove of the DNA, but there
is an inherent drawback associated with AutoDock software, which identifies
most of the small molecules as minor groove binders for DNA.23 Hence, to further understand the binding interaction
between the synthesized thiophenyl esters [(1) or (2)] and ctDNA, we have done a series of experiments and the
results are discussed below.

3.3 UV–Vis Spectral
Responses of p-Hydroxycinnamic-thiophenyl Ester (1) and p-N,N-Dimethylaminocinnamic-thiophenyl
Ester (2) in the Presence of ctDNA
Chromophoric/fluorophoric
small molecules show intense change in the spectral behavior when
their microenvironment is changed, and this can happen when biomacromolecules,
like proteins and DNA, are present in their vicinity. These spectral
changes of small molecules can be monitored to explore their usefulness
as molecular probe for that biomacromolecule (in the present case,
it is ctDNA). Hence, to explore the possibility of the use of thiophenyl
esters (1) and (2) as probe for DNA, we
have studied their UV–vis spectral responses individually in
the presence of different concentrations of ctDNA.

The absorption
spectra of (1) and (2) recorded in the absence
and presence of different concentrations of ctDNA are shown in Figure 3a,b respectively.

Figure 3 UV–vis
spectra of (a) p-hydroxycinnamic-thiophenyl
ester (1) (0.015 mM) in the absence (dashed line) and
presence of different concentrations (0.003–0.076 mM) of ctDNA
and (b) p-N,N-dimethylaminocinnamic-thiophenyl
ester (2) (0.06 mM) in the absence (dashed line) and
presence of different concentrations (0.014–0.087 mM) of ctDNA
in Tris–HCl buffer (10 mM) at pH 7.4. Directions of arrows
indicate the increase of Absmax at the corresponding λmax value.

Absorption spectrum of
(1) (in Tris–HCl buffer,
pH 7.4) is characterized by the appearance of a prominent band at
343 nm and two overlapping small humps at 223 and 236 nm (denoted
by the dotted curve in Figure 3a). In case of (2), a prominent band at 354 nm
was observed in addition to another small peak at 221 nm and a broad
hump at 280 nm (denoted by the dotted curve in Figure 3b). On gradual addition of ctDNA solution
to (1), humps at 223 and 236 nm became more sharp and
shifted to λmax values 212 and 258 nm, respectively,
at saturation.

In case of (2), gradual addition
of ctDNA solution
changed its spectral pattern. The band at 354 nm became more broad,
whereas the two overlapping bands at 221 and 280 nm became distinctly
separated. At the same time, these bands became more sharp and shifted
to 215 and 258 nm, respectively. The increase of absorbance value
at 223 nm was associated with blue shift or hypsochromic shift for
(1). A similar phenomenon was observed in case of (2). But in case of the band at λmax 236 nm,
the bathochromic or red shift was observed for (1). Hypsochromic
or blue shift of the λmax values (from 221 to 215
nm and from 280 to 258 nm) were observed for (2). Intensities
of these bands were also gradually increased with the increasing concentration
of ctDNA solution.

Small molecules can interact with DNA through
two types of binding
modes: intercalation and groove binding. Electrostatic mode of binding
is also observed depending upon the availability of the charged structure
of the small molecule, but this does not resemble the present case.
In case of intercalation mode of binding, pronounced hypochromic shift
associated with broadening of the band envelope and bathochromic or
red shift of the λmax value are observed.

A
large shifting of λmax value is generally observed
in the case of groove binding small molecules.2,3,8,9,37−39,40a However, no such prominent characteristic features of either intercalation
or groove binding were observed in the present case (Figure 3). But prominent changes in
the UV–vis spectral characteristics of (1) and
(2) in the presence of ctDNA surely indicated the strong
noncovalent intermolecular interactions between (1) [or
(2)] and ctDNA, leading to the formation of ground-state
(1)–ctDNA or (2)–ctDNA complexes,
respectively.

The formation constants KB of the (1)–ctDNA or (2)–ctDNA
complex were
evaluated spectrophotometrically by applying the Benesi–Hildebrand
equation40b as shown below 1  where A0 and A are the
absorbance values of free and bound ligands [(1) or (2)], respectively, and A∞ is the absorbance of the final complex. The Benesi–Hildebrand
plots of (1) and (2) are shown in the inset
of Figure 3a,b, respectively.
The straight-line trend in the Benesi–Hildebrand plot suggests
the possible formation of 1:1 complex between (1) [or
(2)] and ctDNA.6 From the
plot of 1/(A – A0) to 1/[ctDNA], the ratio of the intercept to the slope gives the
binding constant KB. The binding constants
(KB) were found to be 1.63 × 104 and 0.10 × 103 M–1 for
(1) and (2), respectively.

3.4 Steady-State Fluorescence Studies on the Interaction
of Thiophenyl Esters [(1) or (2)] with ctDNA
The fluorescence emission spectra of (1) and (2) in the absence and presence of different concentrations
of ctDNA were recorded individually and the results are shown in Figures 4a and 5a, respectively.

Figure 4 (a) Fluorescence emission spectra of p-hydroxycinnamic-thiophenyl
ester (1) (0.037 mM) in the absence (dashed line) and
presence of different concentrations (0.030–0.527 mM) of ctDNA
solution in Tris–HCl buffer (10 mM, pH = 7.4) at 25 °C.
The excitation wavelength (λex) was 280 nm. The direction
of arrow indicates the fluorescence quenching on gradual increase
of concentration of ctDNA. (b) Stern–Volmer plot for the quenching
of the fluorescence emission intensity of (1) in the
presence of ctDNA as fluorescence quencher. (c) Plot of log[(F0 – F)/F] vs log[ctDNA] to calculate binding constant (KB) and the number of binding sites (n) of (1) at 25 °C in Tris–HCl buffer medium.

Figure 5 (a) Fluorescence emission spectra of p-N,N-dimethylamino cinnamic-thiophenyl
ester
(2) (0.074 mM) in the absence (dashed line) and presence
of different concentrations (0.029–1.067 mM) of ctDNA solution
in Tris–HCl buffer (10 mM, pH = 7.4) at 25 °C. The excitation
wavelength (λex) was 280 nm. The direction of arrow
indicates the fluorescence quenching on gradual increase of concentration
of ctDNA. (b) Stern–Volmer plot for the quenching of fluorescence
emission intensity of (2) in the presence of ctDNA as
fluorescence quencher. (c) Plot of log[(F0– F)/F] vs log[ctDNA] to
calculate binding constant (KB) and the
number of binding sites (n) of (2) at
25 °C in Tris–HCl buffer medium.

The distinct change of fluorophoric behavior of (1) [and also that of (2)] was observed in the presence
of ctDNA. The dashed curves in Figures 4a and 5a denote the fluorescence
spectra of (1) and (2) in the absence of
ctDNA, respectively. Upon photoexcitation at 280 nm (λex), (1) showed three emission band maxima (λem) at 312, 368, and 494 nm, whereas (2) showed
two emission band maxima at λem 494 and 516 nm.

On gradual addition of ctDNA solution to (1), a significant
decrease in the fluorescence intensity was observed. A similar phenomenon
was also observed for (2). A prominent quenching of fluorescence
intensity at λem 494 nm of (1) was observed,
whereas the fluorescence intensity of other two bands at λem 312 and 368 nm remained almost unchanged. A gradual blue
shift of the band at λem 494 nm occurred to 487 nm
(Figure 4a). On the
other hand, for (2), a prominent quenching of the bands
at λem 494 and 516 nm was observed (Figure 5a), but interestingly, the
λem at 516 nm of (2) began to disappear
at saturation, accompanying with a gradual blue shift of the bands
at λem 494–486 nm (Figure 5a).

3.5 Mode of Interaction between
Thiophenyl Ester
[p-Hydroxycinnamic-thiophenyl Ester (1) or p-N,N-Dimethylaminocinnamic-thiophenyl
Ester (2)] and ctDNA
Quenching (as in the present
case) or enhancement of fluorescence of a fluorophore during its interaction
with either a fluorescence quencher or an enhancer may be the outcome
of several processes like excited-state energy-transfer reactions
or ground-state complex formation8,41 which are
mechanistically classified into two categories: dynamic and static
fluorescence quenching or enhancement.37,41,42 To understand the mechanistic pathway involved in
the case of fluorescence quenching of either (1) [or
(2)] during its interaction with ctDNA, we have applied
the classical Stern–Volmer equation for quenching7,42 as shown below 2  where F0 and F represent the fluorescence
intensities of (1) [or (2)] in the absence
and presence of different
concentrations of the quencher, i.e., ctDNA, respectively. The concentration
of ctDNA is denoted by [E], and KSV represents
the Stern–Volmer constant.

Stern–Volmer plots
(F0/F vs [E]) for (1) and (2) are shown in Figures 4b and 5b, respectively,
and we have calculated the Stern–Volmer fluorescence quenching
constant KSV as 8.75 × 103 M–1 for (1) and 8.49 × 103 M–1 for (2).

We have
further exploited the fluorescence intensity quenching
data of (1) [and also that of (2)] in the
presence of ctDNA to measure their binding constants (KB) and number of binding sites (n). The
change of fluorescence intensity at λem 494 nm for
(1) and also for (2) was used to calculate
the corresponding KB and n values by applying the following equation8,43,44 3  where F0 and F are the fluorescence intensities
of (1) and
(2) at λem 494 nm in the absence and
presence of different concentrations of ctDNA, respectively. In each
case of (1) or (2), log KB was calculated from the linear plot of log[(F0 – F)/F] vs log[ctDNA]
[r2 = 0.99 for both (1) and
(2)], as shown in Figures 4c and 5c, respectively. The
values of KB and n were
obtained as 1.38 × 103 M–1 and 1.07
≈ 1.0 for (1) and 2.40 × 103 M–1 and 1.12 ≈ 1.0 for (2), indicating the weak binding between (1) and (2) with ctDNA.

These KSV values are comparable to
those of the small-molecule fluorophores, such as 3-hydroxyflavones,
isoxazolcurcumin, and curcumin derivatives7,8 which
showed static fluorescence enhancement/quenching phenomena associated
with ground-state complex formation. These small molecules are also
known to be DNA groove binders. So, in the present case of (1) and (2), we can assume a similar type of process
of fluorescence quenching of these compounds in the presence of a
quencher, like DNA. This may be originated due to the ground-state
complex formation of (1) or (2) with DNA
possibly via groove binding mode of interaction. However, to further
verify these facts, we have done viscometric measurements of ctDNA
in the presence of (1) or (2).

3.6 Viscosity Measurements To Elucidate the Mode
of Interaction between Thiophenyl Esters [p-Hydroxycinnamic-thiophenyl
Ester (1) or p-N,N-Dimethylaminocinnamic-thiophenyl Ester (2)] and ctDNA
Change of viscosity of DNA solution in the
presence of various concentrations of small-molecule-based binding
ligands is an indication of their intermolecular interaction/complexation
with ctDNA. In the presence of a perfect intercalator ligand, the
DNA base pairs became separated and thus the chain length of DNA increases,
which ultimately increases the viscosity of the DNA solution.8,45 However, decrease of viscosity of DNA solution is observed when
the ligand is a partial or nonclassical intercalator.8,37,45 In case of ligands binding at
DNA grooves or ligands binding DNA through electrostatic interactions,
no change of viscosity of DNA solution can be observed.8,37,45

The change of relative
viscosity (η/η0) of ctDNA solution (0.08 mM)
on gradual addition of different concentration of (1)
[or (2)] in Tris–HCl buffer (10 mM, pH = 7.4)
is shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Effects of p-hydroxycinnamic-thiophenyl ester
(1) (black diamond line) and p-N,N-dimethylaminocinnamic-thiophenyl ester
(2) (red triangle line) (0.01–0.08 mM) on the
relative viscosity of ctDNA (0.08 mM) at 25 °C.

As shown in Figure 6, a gradual increase in viscosity of ctDNA solution
on interaction
with (1) was noticed. A similar result was also observed
with (2). So, these viscosity measurement data obviously
confirmed the binding activities of (1) or (2) with ctDNA through intercalation mode of intermolecular interaction.
This was further established with the help of circular dichroism (CD)
studies of ctDNA in the presence of (1) [or (2)].

3.7 Circular Dichroism (CD) Studies To Confirm
the Mode of Interaction between Thiophenyl Esters [p-Hydroxycinnamic-thiophenyl Ester (1) or p-N,N-Dimethylaminocinnamic-thiophenyl
Ester (2)] and ctDNA
DNA undergoes conformational
changes on binding with small-molecule ligands. This can be monitored
by measuring its CD spectra in the absence and presence of the respective
binding ligand. These changes in the CD pattern of DNA often indicate
the mode of binding of that particular ligand to DNA. For a small-molecule
ligand-based classical intercalator, a significant decrease of intensities
of both the positive and negative bands of CD spectrum of the bound
DNA is observed, but the intensities of these two CD bands of DNA
remain unchanged on its binding with a small molecule, which prefers
groove binding, more precisely minor groove binding mode of interaction.8,46

CD spectra of ctDNA in the absence and presence of different
concentrations of (1) [or (2)] with ctDNA
are shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Circular dichroism (CD) spectra of ctDNA (0.15 mM) in the absence
(red line) and presence of different concentrations (0.01–0.037
mM) of p-hydroxycinnamic-thiophenyl ester (1) and p-N,N-dimethylamino cinnamic-thiophenyl ester (2) in Tris–HCl
buffer (10 mM, pH = 7.4) medium at 25 °C. The dashed line shows
the CD spectrum of Tris–HCl buffer as the reference. Benesi–Hildebrand
plots of 1/Δθ vs 1/[(1)] or 1/Δθ
vs 1/[(2)] are shown in a(i) and b(i), respectively.

We have used these CD spectrum
data of ctDNA when it binds to (1) [or (2)] to confirm the mode of binding of
(1) [or (2)] with ctDNA. Being achiral,
(1) and (2) are not optically active and
no CD spectra were observed for (1) and also for (2) in the wavelength region (200–350 nm) selected for
the present experiment. CD spectrum of the free ctDNA, i.e., in the
absence of (1) [or (2)] in Tris–HCl
buffer medium (10 mM, pH = 7.4), showed two bands: a positive band
274 nm and a negative band 245 nm (Figure 7a,b) which originates due to π–π
stacking of DNA base pairs and right-handed helicity of DNA, respectively.
This type of characteristic nature of CD spectrum is often associated
with the B-form of DNA.47 However, on addition
of (1) [or (2)] to ctDNA, significant changes
in the intensities of negative bands as well as positive bands of
CD spectra of DNA were observed (Figure 7a,b). Similar conclusions can be drawn regarding
the mode of binding of (2) with ctDNA (Figure 7b). This indicates the intercalative
binding mode of interaction of (1) [or (2)] with ctDNA. We have further explored the CD responses of DNA at
245 nm to calculate equilibrium constant (KB) by applying the Benesi–Hildebrand equation8,48 4  where θ – θ0 = change of CD responses
of ctDNA at 245 nm, θ = CD response
of ctDNA on gradual addition of ligand, thiophenyl ester [(1) or (2)], θ0 = CD response of ctDNA
in the absence of either (1) or (2), and
θ1 = final CD response of thiophenyl ester–ctDNA.
From the linear plot of 1/(θ – θ0) versus
1/[ligand] (Figure 7a(i),b(i)), we have calculated the binding constant KB for (1) and (2) as 3.43 ×
104 and 1.93 × 104 M–1, respectively, which are in accordance with the results obtained
from fluorescence spectroscopic studies. These values suggest the
possibility of intercalative binding mode of interaction between (1) and ctDNA and also between (2) and ctDNA.48 However, the changes in the CD bands in case
of (1) [and also for (2)] are not so drastic
as it is observed for a perfect intercalator.

3.8 Biocompatibilities
of (1) and
(2)
Previous report on (1) showed
its weak activity toward M. tuberculosis.12 However, no report on bioactivity
was found for (2). In the present case, we have done
an elaborate study on the biocompatibilities of (1) and
(2) (detailed experimental methods are discussed in Supporting Information, pp S21 and S22).

The cell cytotoxicity assay of compounds (1) and (2) performed on the normal human cell line, HEK293, using
the MTT assay method showed a concentration- and time-dependent effect.
More than 82% of the cells survived after 24 h of exposure to compound
(1) at its 30 μM concentration (Figure S2, Supporting Information, p S22). This value was
found to be approximately 70 and 45% at 48 and 72 h, respectively.
A proportion of 54% of the cells survived in case of compound (2) after 24 h of its exposure at 15 μM concentration
(Figure S2, Supporting Information, p S22).
The effect of these compounds (at their 40 μM concentration)
on S. cerevisiae cells were also evaluated
for a period of up to 10 days. No toxicity of the compounds was observed
after checking for viability of the cells at 0, 2, and 10 days.

In case of compound (1), cytotoxicity toward normal
human cell lines (HEK293) was observed after a concentration of 30
μM, but in case of compound (2), this optimal cytotoxic
concentration was found to be 15 μM. Lower concentrations of
these compounds did not significantly affect the animal cell lines.
More than 70% growth of cells was observed for compound (1) up to its 30 μM concentration. However, the same growth rate
of cells was noted with compound (2) when its concentration
was 12 μM. Furthermore, no such toxicity was observed in case
of in vivo cytotoxicity assay using S. cerevisiae cells. Even at 40 μM concentrations of compounds (1) and (2), no loss in viability was observed in cells.
This difference in results between the animal cell lines and yeast
cells may be due to the difference in the composition of the cell
walls of these two different kinds of cells. Microbial cells may be
inherently hard as they are more exposed to inclement conditions on
their growth. The difference in their bioactivity may be originated
from the difference in their substituent pattern (Figure 1).

4 Conclusions
Development of easy and low-cost synthetic methodologies for α,β-unsaturated
thioester type of compounds having prominent photochromic behavior
or having potential to be used as synthetic intermediates in various
important organic transformations is a well-appreciated research problem.
In this context, our work may be noteworthy as in the present work,
under the same reaction condition using (COCl)2/DMF and
PhSH/Et3N in DCM medium at ambient temperature. We have
synthesized four structurally and photochromically different thiophenyl
derivatives, among which (1–3) are
thiophenyl esters of p-hydroxycinnamic and (4) is a novel stilbene-type compound (to the best of our knowledge)
substituted with dimethylamine and thiophenyl groups.

Furthermore,
(1) and (2) showed a drastic
change in their intrinsic chromophoric/fluorophoric activities during
their interactions with ctDNA. Spectroscopic (UV–vis, fluorescence,
and CD) and viscometric measurements indicated the intercalation mode
of binding between these thiophenyl esters (1) or (2) and ctDNA. However, results of a preliminary molecular
docking study indicate the possibility of minor groove binding mode
of hydrogen-bonding interaction of (1) [or (2)] with ctDNA. It is interesting to note that structurally these
compounds satisfy the characteristics of both intercalator and groove
binders for DNA. These two compounds have single-bonded flexible parts,
for which torsional rotation of molecule (1) [or (2)] is possible.8 This may help
these molecules to be fit into the shallow minor groove of DNA. On
the other hand, (1) and (2) have planar
parts (aromatic rings), which may allow them to interact with DNA
through the intercalation mode.9 So, it
is quite possible that these compounds are not perfect intercalator
or perfect grooved binder of DNA.

It is also worth mentioning
that the change of intrinsic fluorescence
activity of (1) [or (2)] in the presence
of biomacromolecule like ctDNA opens up the possibility for application
of this type of small molecules as DNA-based fluorescence biomarkers.
Moreover, the change of fluorescence activity of (1)
[or (2)] in the presence of biomacromolecule like DNA
(monitored under the physiological condition) can be considered as
a model to understand the drug–DNA interaction, which is highly
essential for the development of novel therapeutic agents. However,
(1) will be comparatively more suitable than (2), considering its high biocompatible.
