Combretastatin
(CA-4) and its analogues are undergoing several
clinical trials for treating different types of tumors. In this work,
the antiproliferative activity of a series of 2-aminoimidazole-carbonyl
analogs of clinically relevant combretastatins A-4 (CA-4) and A-1
was evaluated using a cell-based assay. Among the compounds tested, C-13 and C-21 displayed strong antiproliferative
activities against HeLa cells. C-13 inhibited the proliferation
of lung carcinoma (A549) cells more potently than combretastatin A-4. C-13 also retarded the migration of A549 cells. Interestingly, C-13 displayed much stronger antiproliferative effects against
breast carcinoma and skin melanoma cells compared to noncancerous
breast epithelial and skin fibroblast cells. C-13 strongly
disassembled cellular microtubules, perturbed the localization of
EB1 protein, inhibited mitosis in cultured cells, and bound to tubulin
at the colchicine site and inhibited the polymerization of reconstituted
microtubules in vitro. C-13 treatment increased the level
of reactive oxygen species and induced apoptosis via poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase-cleavage in HeLa cells. The results revealed the importance
of the 2-aminoimidazole-carbonyl motif as a double bond replacement
in combretastatin and indicated a pharmacodynamically interesting
pattern of H-bond acceptors/donors and requisite syn-templated aryls.

==== Body
Introduction
Several natural products
and their derivatives such as paclitaxel,
docetaxel, vinblastine, vincristine, vinorelbine, vindesine, and ixabepilone
are highly successful as microtubule-targeting anticancer agents.1−7 These compounds act by interfering with the microtubule dynamics
upon binding to tubulin.2−4 In addition, several natural products
such as combretastatins, epothilones, dolastatins, and 2-methoxyestradiol
are undergoing clinical trials for cancer chemotherapy.2,3,8 Among these natural products,
combretastatin A-4 (CA-4), isolated from the Cape Bush willow tree, Combretum caffrum(9) and
its several derivatives have shown strong anticancer potential in
clinical trials.2,3,8,10 In addition to its strong antiproliferative
activity, CA-4 is also known to display anti-angiogenic11,12 and anti-vascular activity.13−16 Currently, combretastatin A4 phosphate (CA-4P), a
phosphate prodrug of CA-4,17−19 has completed phase II clinical
trials for the therapy of advanced anaplastic thyroid cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov
identifier: NCT00060242), pathologic myopia (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:
NCT01423149), and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (ClinicalTrials.gov
identifier: NCT01023295). In addition, CA-4P is undergoing phase III
clinical trials for anaplastic thyroid cancer in combination with
carboplatin/paclitaxel (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00507429).
Oxi4503, a synthetic phosphorylated prodrug of combretastatin A-1,20−22 has completed phase I clinical trials for hepatic tumor (ClinicalTrials.gov
identifier: NCT00960557) and advanced solid tumors (ClinicalTrials.gov
identifier: NCT00977210) and is undergoing phase I/II trials on acute
myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes in combination
with cytarabine (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02576301). A benzophenone
analogue of CA-4, CKD-516,23−25 and a serine amino acid derivative
of CA-4, AVE806226−28 have completed phase I clinical trials on solid tumors
(ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01560325 and NCT00968916). Analogues
of combretastatin thus may have a great potential in cancer chemotherapy.

Although CA-4 is a promising clinical candidate, a number of issues
are associated with it. It has a short biological half-life29 and undergoes cis–trans isomerization
in heat, light, and protic media, forming the inactive trans form
from the active cis form.30,31 To inhibit metabolic
degradation and to retain the cis configuration of the combretastatins,
replacement of the olefinic motif by heterocyclic32−40 or carbocyclic41−43 rings and bridging functional groups44−50 has become a valuable approach.8 Although
a number of significant contributions have been made in the field
of rigid combretastatin analogs, only limited examples of this approach
using an imidazole core have been documented.44,51,52

Incorporation of a relevant scaffold
in generating a new molecular
skeleton as the potential target-specific bioactive agent is a crucial
aspect in drug discovery. 2-Aminoimidazole is a valuable heterocyclic
motif that is common in the marine-sponge alkaloids53,54 and in therapeutic/bioactive agents.29,37,55,56 It can provide an interesting
hydrogen bond donor/acceptor pattern, while interacting with a target.
With varied poly-substitutions/functionalities, the 2-aminoimidazoles
exhibit diverse physicochemical properties.57,58 Recently, we found a new series of 4,5-diaryl-2-aminoimidazole analogues
as potent tubulin assembly inhibitors44 and explored the distinctive pharmacophoric features of 2-aminoimidazole
as a bridging motif. The incorporation of an additional linker between
the bridging alkene motif and the aryl group to provide the flexibility
is significant.59 To synthesize CA-4-inspired
new molecular entities, a series of 4-aryl-5-aroylimidazole-2-amines
has been considered (Figure 1). We imagined that the substitution of the olefinic bond
of CA-4 with a 2-aminoimidazole bridging motif would provide hydrogen
bond donor/acceptor points by C2-amino and ring N/NH functionalities
for tubulin binding (Figure 1). Further, it can induce drug-like properties and increase
water solubility. It is worth mentioning that the carbonyl oxygen
of phenstatin generates essential interactions with the colchicine
binding site of tubulin.46 The carbonyl
oxygen in new agents (aroylindole and diarylketone–chalcone)
was found to impede the assembly of tubulin and enhance the antiproliferative
ability.40,60−62 Therefore, the assembly
of 2-aminoimidazole-carbonyl as a bridging motif, trimethoxyphenyl
as a ring, and varied relevant aryls and heteroaryls as the other
ring can be an important approach for discovering potential tubulin
inhibitors (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Design of novel 4-aryl-5-aroyl-imidazole-2-amines.40,44,59,61,62

Interestingly, several
of the tested 2-aminoimidazole-carbonyl
analogues of CA-4 displayed pronounced antiproliferative activities
against HeLa and A549 cells. Among these, C-13 was found
to be significantly more potent than CA-4 against lung carcinoma cells.
Most importantly, C-13 displayed 15.7 and 4 folds higher
antiproliferative activity toward breast cancer and skin melanoma
cells compared to their noncancerous counterparts, respectively. Further, C-13 displayed more specific cytotoxicity toward breast cancer
cells as compared to noncancerous breast epithelial cells than its
parent compound CA-4. C-13 strongly depolymerized both
interphase and mitotic microtubules, perturbed chromosome organization,
halted mitotic progression in cultured cells, and induced apoptotic
cell death. The importance of the molecular skeleton in the structural
modulation of combretastatin-inspired clinical agents has been explored,
and the evidence presented in the study indicated that C-13 has a strong anticancer potential.

Results and Discussion
Chemistry
2-Aminoimidazoles are routinely synthesized
via the condensation of an α-haloketone with an acetylated guanidine,
or condensation of an α-aminoketone with cyanamide63−65 or by functionalization of imidazole scaffold via protection, C2-amination,
introduction of substituents, and deprotection.66 These classical reactions as key steps in synthesis are
not feasible to prepare our designed 4-aryl-5-aroyl-2-aminoimidazole
series of compounds with relevant substitution diversity. We have
developed recently a method67 to access
polysubstituted aminoimidazoles. The method circumvents the necessity
of electronic modulation of guanidine. The reaction pathway involves
aza-Michael addition, SN2, and a unique redox-neutral process.
Significant advantages of the developed methodology are the convenient
procedure, step economy, excellent substrate scope, introduction of
distinctive substitutions/functionalities into the 2-aminoimidazole
core, and use of easily accessible materials. Keeping in view the
potential structural features of 4-aryl-5-aroylimidazole-2-amines
for exhibiting tubulin polymerization inhibitory activity, we synthesized
a series of investigational compounds in our previous work67 and two new compounds (8 and 10) with relevant substitutions (compounds 1–21, Figure 2). Compounds 8 and 10 that possess hydroxyl functionality
were obtained from compounds 7 and 9, respectively,
by Pd–C-catalyzed hydrogenative debenzylation. The trimethoxyphenyl
motif was considered in ring A. Several relevantly substituted aryls
and heteroaryls were considered in ring B. Aromatics contain methoxy,
hydroxyl, methoxy-hydroxyl, dimethoxy, trimethoxy, fluoro, chloro,
and cyano groups. Heteroaromatics are quinoline, pyridine, and thiophene
groups/motifs. It is worth to mention that the quinolinyl motif as
ring B in our previously explored combretastatin analog44 showed its pharmacophoric importance in displaying
potent tubulin polymerization inhibitory property. Switch in substituted
aryl rings (A vs B) was also considered in the synthesis (4 and 16). Also, to validate the significance of 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl
moiety in ring A, few compounds without trimethoxy substitutions were
prepared (17–20).

Figure 2 Structures of investigated combretastatin
inspired 2-aminoimidazoles
(1–7, 9, 11–21)67 and 8 and 10: all the compounds except compounds 8 and 10 were prepared by vicinal Csp2–H and Csp2–Br guanidination reaction and were reported previously.67

All the products were identified by 1H and 13C NMR and IR spectroscopic techniques and confirmed by high-resolution
mass spectrometry (HRMS). Further, single-crystal X-ray crystallographic
analysis of the synthesized compound67 indicated
that the skeleton possesses syn-locking of two aryl rings across the
2-aminoimidazole-carbonyl motif and a favorable range of dihedral
angle of two aryls as known in the literature,59,68 indicating skeleton’s flexibility to have an important three-dimensional
structural feature required in binding with tubulin at the colchicine
site.

Biological Studies
Screening Assay
The combretastatin
analogues (1–21) were initially screened using
HeLa cells at 25
nM concentration by sulforhodamine B assay.44,69 The compounds inhibited HeLa cell proliferation with varying ability
as shown in Figure 3. Of the compounds evaluated, 7 compounds showed more than 50% inhibition
of HeLa cell proliferation at 25 nM concentration (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Screening of combretastatin
analogues in HeLa cells. The inhibition
of cell proliferation was plotted for each of the analogue at 25 nM
concentration in HeLa cells. Three sets of experiments were carried
out. Error bars represent standard deviation.

To find out the most potent compound against lung carcinoma,
the
half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of these active
compounds was deduced in A549 cells in comparison with CA-4 (Table 1, Figure S5A). C-13 and CA-4 inhibited the proliferation
of A549 cells with an IC50 of 48 ± 10 and 112 ±
7 nM, respectively, indicating that C-13 was more potent
than CA-4 against A549 cells. Therefore, the antiproliferative activity
of C-13 was further characterized.

C-13 Showed Potent Antiproliferative
Activity against
Various Cancer Cell Lines
C-13 exerted potent
cytotoxic effects on different types of tumor cells in culture including
a multidrug-resistant breast cancer, EMT6/AR1 cell line (Table 2, Figure S5B–G). For example, C-13 inhibited
HeLa cell proliferation with an IC50 of 36 ± 3 nM.
Interestingly, C-13 inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7,
MCF 10A, B16F10, and L929 cells with an IC50 of 121 ±
10, 1891 ± 55, 416 ± 20, and 1655 ± 111 nM, respectively
(Table 2, Figure S5B–F). The finding indicated that C-13 exerted 15.7 and 4 times stronger antiproliferative effects
on MCF-7 breast cancer cells and B16F10 skin melanoma cells than noncancerous
MCF 10A breast epithelial cells and L929 skin fibroblast cells, respectively.
CA-4 inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7 and MCF 10A cells with an
IC50 of 18 ± 3 and 144 ± 31 nM, respectively
(Figure S6). The antiproliferative activity
of C-21 was also tested in B16F10 and L929 cells. C-21 showed an IC50 of 456 ± 78 and 1812 ±
56 nM in B16F10 and L929 cells, respectively.

C-13 Depolymerized Microtubules
in HeLa and A549
Cells
Combretastatin derivatives are well-known microtubule
depolymerizing agents. C-13 also induced microtubule
depolymerization in HeLa and A549 cells (Figure 4). At a concentration of 100 nM, C-13 induced a significant depolymerization of microtubules and 200 nM C-13 induced a strong depolymerization of interphase microtubules
in HeLa and A549 cells (Figure 4). Further, C-13 strongly depolymerized spindle
microtubules in HeLa and A549 cells and perturbed the bipolar spindle
formation, causing misalignment of chromosomes at the metaphase plate
(Figure 5). Using γ-tubulin
staining, 3, 24, and 58% of the mitotic spindles was found to be multipolar
in the absence and presence of 100 and 200 nM C-13. Similar
microtubule depolymerizing effects were observed in HeLa and A549
cells with C-21 (Figures S7 and S8).

Figure 4 C-13 depolymerized microtubules in HeLa and A549 cells.
HeLa and A549 cells were incubated in the absence and in the presence
of 100 and 200 nM C-13 for 24 h and subjected to immunostaining.
Grayscale images are shown. The scale bar is 10 μm.

Figure 5 Effect of C-13 on mitotic spindles of HeLa
and A549
cells. HeLa and A549 cells were incubated in the absence and presence
of 100 and 200 nM C-13 for 24 h. Cells were fixed and
stained for α-tubulin (green) and DNA (blue). The scale bar
is 10 μm.

HeLa cells were incubated
with 200 nM C-13 for 1 and
2 h. This short exposure of C-13 also strongly disassembled
both interphase and spindle microtubules and affected chromosome congression
in the mitotic HeLa cells (Figure S9A,B). To check the reversibility of the effect of the compound, HeLa
cells were treated with 200 nM C-13 for 1 h followed
by washing the compound. The percentage of dead cells in C-13-treated cells was found to be two times higher than the vehicle-treated
cells, suggesting that even a brief exposure of C-13 can
induce cell killing (Figure S10).

To confirm that C-13 induced microtubule depolymerization
in HeLa cells, the ratio of polymeric to soluble tubulin in HeLa cells
was determined using western blotting (Figure 6A). The ratio of polymeric to soluble tubulin
in HeLa cells was determined to be 2.1 ± 0.4, 1.6 ± 0.1,
and 1.1 ± 0.1 in the absence and presence of 120 and 240 nM C-13 (Figure 6B). The ratio of polymeric to soluble tubulin of cells treated with
25 nM vinblastine was found to be 1.4 ± 0.9. The decrease in
the polymeric tubulin and the increase in the soluble fraction of
tubulin suggested that C-13 depolymerizes microtubules
in HeLa cells.

Figure 6 C-13 reduced the polymeric/soluble tubulin
fraction
in HeLa cells as determined by western blot. (A) HeLa cells were treated
either without or with 120 and 240 nM C-13 for 24 h.
Vinblastine (25 nM) was used as a positive control. The polymeric
and soluble fractions of tubulin were isolated and an equal amount
of protein was loaded onto sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Immunoblotting was carried out using a
monoclonal antibody against α-tubulin. The experiment was carried
out three times. One of the blots is shown. (B) Ratio of polymer/soluble
tubulin fraction was quantified using ImageJ software, and statistical
significance was determined using student’s t-test. (ns: p > 0.05; *: p <
0.05). The error bar signifies standard deviation.

Microtubule-targeting agents generally perturb
microtubule dynamics
at a lower concentration than it is required to visibly depolymerize
microtubules.3,70,71 EB1, a plus-tip binding protein,72 binds
to the growing end of dynamic microtubules; therefore, a change in
the localization of EB1 may provide an idea about the perturbation
of microtubule dynamics. Thus, we examined the effect of C-13 on the localization of EB1 in GFP-EB1-expressing HeLa cells. In
control HeLa cells, EB1 comets were distinctly observed at the tips
of microtubules (Figure 7). However, at 35 and 70 nM C-13, the localization of
EB1 was perturbed, and fewer, diffused comets of EB1 were observed
(Figure 7), suggesting
that the delocalization of EB1 was in response to perturbation of
the microtubule architecture in HeLa cells. The finding indicated
that C-13 could perturb microtubule dynamics.

Figure 7 C-13 affected the localization of EB1. GFP-EB1-expressing
HeLa cells were treated with either the vehicle or 35 and 70 nM C-13, and live-cell imaging was carried out. The scale bar
is shown in the figure.

C-13 Induced Mitotic Block in HeLa Cells
Because chromosome movement during mitosis is dependent on microtubules
and an improper alignment of the chromosomes can induce mitotic block,
we examined whether C-13 can block cells at mitosis or
not. The effect of C-13 on the progression of HeLa cells
was first examined by flow cytometry. The percentage of HeLa cells
in the G2/M phase was determined to be 26, 70, and 78% in the absence
and presence of 75 and 200 nM C-13, indicating that C-13 treatment prevents the progression of HeLa cells at the
G2/M phase (Figure 8A). HeLa cells treated with 20 nM CA-4 showed 73% of cells in the
G2/M phase (Table S1).

Figure 8 C-13 increased
the mitotic index in HeLa cells. (A)
HeLa cells were incubated in the absence (a) and presence of 75 nM C-13 (b), 200 nM C-13 (c), and 20 nM CA-4 (d)
for 12 h, and cell cycle analysis was performed using flow cytometry
by staining the DNA in cells with propidium iodide (PI). The experiment
was performed twice. (B) HeLa cells were incubated in the absence
and presence of 75 and 200 nM C-13 for 12 h. Cells were
stained with antibody against phospho-histone H3 (green), and Hoechst
33258 was used for staining the DNA (blue). The experiment was performed
thrice. The scale bar is 10 μm.

C-13 treatment was found to halt the progression
of
HeLa cells at the G2/M phase; therefore, we next determined the effect
of the compound on the mitotic index. The effect of C-13 on the mitotic index in HeLa cells was first determined based on
the morphology of DNA, stained using Hoechst 33258 dye (Table 3). The mitotic index of the
vehicle-treated control was found to be 3 ± 0.6, whereas in the
presence of 75 and 200 nM C-13, the mitotic index increased
to 12 ± 2.3 and 23 ± 2.2, indicating that C-13 treatment increased the mitotic index of HeLa cells. Under similar
conditions, HeLa cells treated with 20 nM CA-4 showed a mitotic index
of 40 ± 1.2.

Data are an average of at least three sets, and 500 cells were counted
in each case.

In mitosis,
histone H3 at serine 10 gets phosphorylated and acts
as a marker for mitosis.73C-13 increased the number of phospho-histone-positive cells with the
increasing concentration compared to the vehicle-treated control (Figure 8B, Table 3). The percentages of mitotic
cells were found to be 3 ± 0.2, 13 ± 0.3, and 23 ±
0.7 in the presence of 0, 75, and 200 nM C-13, respectively.
The results together suggested that C-13 induces a mitotic
block in HeLa cells. Under similar experimental conditions, the percentage
of mitotic cells in HeLa cells treated with 20 nM CA-4 was found to
be 38 ± 0.3.

Characterization of C-13 Binding
to Tubulin
The binding interaction of C-13 to
tubulin was investigated
using the tryptophan fluorescence of tubulin. C-13 decreased
the fluorescence intensity of tubulin, indicating that the compound
interacts with tubulin (Figure 9A). The changes in the fluorescence intensities were fitted
into a binding equation to determine a dissociation constant (Kd) for the interaction of tubulin with C-13 (Figure 9B). The Kd was calculated to be 1.3 ±
0.4 μM. Similarly, a Kd for the
interaction of tubulin with C-21 was found to be 2.0
± 1.4 μM (Figure S11A,B).

Figure 9 C-13 decreased the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence
of tubulin. (A) Tubulin (2 μM) was incubated without (box solid)
and with different concentrations 0.5 (circle solid), 1 (triangle
up solid), 2 (triangle down solid), 5 (triangle left-pointing solid),
10 (triangle right-pointing solid), 15 (diamond solid), 20 (pentagon
up solid), 25 (pentagon down solid), 30 (star solid), and 40 (circle
with all but the upper left quadrant black) μM of C-13 in PIPES buffer (25 mM, pH 6.8) for 30 min at 25 °C. Fluorescence
emission spectra were monitored using 295 nm as excitation wavelength.
(B) Changes in fluorescence intensity at 335 nm upon binding of C-13 to tubulin were plotted. The experiment was done five
times. One of the five sets is shown.

Determination of the C-13 Binding Site on Tubulin
Combretastatins are reported to interact with tubulin at the colchicine
site.74,75 Molecular docking analysis was performed
to find the putative binding site of C-13 on the tubulin
dimer, as reported recently76 (Figure S12). We first performed docking of N-deacetyl-N-(2-mercaptoacetyl)colchicine
(DAMA-colchicine) on tubulin (PDB ID: 1SA0)77 as well
as the docking of CA-4 on the tubulin dimer (PDB ID: 5LYJ).75 The root mean square deviation (RMSD) values between the
docked and the crystal structures of the DAMA-colchicine and CA-4
were found to be 1.2 and 1.6 Å, respectively, indicating acceptable
docking (Figure S12).

Using a similar
procedure, C-13 was docked on tubulin. On overlapping
the docked conformations of colchicine, CA-4 and C-13, we observed that C-13, similar to colchicine and CA-4,
binds to tubulin at the colchicine-binding site (Figure S13). Further analysis of the interacting residues
lying within 4 Å of the docked conformation of C-13 suggested that the binding pocket is mainly composed of hydrophobic
amino acids (Table S2). Several of the
interacting residues present in the binding pocket of C-13 were also found to be present in the binding pocket of colchicine
and CA-4 (Table S2), suggesting that C-13, colchicine, and CA-4 share a common binding site.

In addition to the hydrophobic interactions, the docked conformation
of C-13 also showed possible hydrogen bonding interactions
of C-13 with tubulin residues (Table S3). The distance between the thiol group of Cys241B and the
aryl-methoxy group of C-13 was measured to be 3.09 Å,
indicating a hydrogen bond between them. Another probable hydrogen
bonding interaction was observed between the amide hydrogen of Ile318B
and aryl-methoxy of C-13 as the distance between them
was 3.07 Å. Further, we measured the distances between carbonyl
oxygen of the amide bond of Asn251B and hydrogen atoms of the amine
of the imidazole moiety of C-13, with distances of 2.54
and 2.77 Å indicating either of the two possible hydrogen bonding
interactions. This suggests that the hydrogen bonding interactions
in addition to the hydrophobic interactions may stabilize C-13 in the binding pocket. A similar analysis was carried out for colchicine
and CA-4 (Table S3).

The binding
energies for colchicine, CA-4, and C-13 were calculated
using AutoDock 4.2 software and were found to be
−9.02, −7.87, and −8.44 kcal/mol, respectively,
indicating that C-13 binds to tubulin dimer more strongly
than CA-4 (Table S3).

Biochemically,
we performed a competitive binding assay with colchicine
to confirm the putative binding site of tubulin. We found out that C-13 decreased the fluorescence intensity of the tubulin–colchicine
complex, implying that C-13 inhibits the binding of colchicine
to tubulin (Figure 10A). A Ki value of 1.1 ± 0.13 μM
was estimated for the inhibitor (Figure 10B). Similarly, C-21 was also
found to decrease the fluorescence intensity of the tubulin–colchicine
complex with a Ki value of 11.7 ±
7.3 μM (Figure S14A,B). In addition,
the previously reported44 compound 12,
a combretastatin analogue, is reported to bind at the colchicine-binding
site on tubulin and the compound fluoresces strongly upon binding
to tubulin. C-13 diminished the fluorescence intensity
of the compound 12–tubulin complex, indicating that C-13 binds to the combretastatin-binding site on tubulin (Figure 10C,D). Thus, the biochemical
competitive binding assays and the docking analysis strongly suggested
that C-13 binds to tubulin at the colchicine-binding
site.

Figure 10 C-13 binds to the colchicine binding site. (A) Tubulin
(5 μM) was incubated without (box solid) and with different
concentrations 2 (circle solid), 5 (triangle up solid), 10 (triangle
down solid), 20 (triangle left-pointing solid), 30 (triangle right-pointing
solid), 50 (diamond solid), 60 (pentagon up solid), and 70 (hexagon
solid) μM of C-13 in PIPES buffer (25 mM, pH 6.8)
for 15 min at 37 °C. Colchicine (10 μM) was then added
into the reaction mixture and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min.
Fluorescence spectra were monitored using 340 nm as the excitation
wavelength. (B) Fluorescence intensity (at 434 nm) change is plotted
against different logarithmic concentrations of C-13.
The experiment was carried out four times. One of the four sets is
shown. (C) Tubulin (2 μM) was incubated without (box solid)
and with different concentrations 2 (circle solid), 5 (triangle up
solid), 10 (triangle down solid), 15 (triangle left-pointing solid),
20 (triangle right-pointing solid), 30 (diamond solid), 50 (pentagon
up solid), and 60 (hexagon solid) μM of C-13 in
PIPES buffer (25 mM, pH 6.8) for 20 min at 37 °C. Subsequently,
a previously reported compound 12 (5 μM) was added into the
reaction milieu and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Fluorescence
spectra were measured using 350 nm as the excitation wavelength. (D)
Percentage inhibition of compound 12 binding against the concentration
of C-13 was plotted. Three sets of experiments were carried
out. One of the three sets is shown.

C-13 Inhibited Microtubule-Associated Protein-Rich
Tubulin and Taxol-Induced Tubulin Polymerization
C-13 disrupted microtubule organization in cells; therefore, the influence
of C-13 on microtubule-associated protein (MAP)-rich
tubulin polymerization was analyzed. C-13 inhibited the
polymerization of MAP-rich tubulin with an IC50 of 63 ±
27 μM (Figure 11A,B). Also, C-13 inhibited taxol-induced polymerization
of purified tubulin (Figure 11C,D). For example, 30, 60, 90, and 150 μM C-13 inhibited tubulin polymerization by 33 ± 9, 40 ± 8, 55
± 8, and 65 ± 18% respectively.

Figure 11 C-13 inhibited
MAP-rich tubulin and taxol-induced
tubulin polymerization. (A) MAP-rich tubulin (2 mg/mL) was polymerized
in the presence of 1 mM GTP without (box solid) and with different
concentrations 5 (circle solid), 10 (triangle up solid), 20 (triangle
down solid), 50 (triangle left-pointing solid), 100 (triangle right-pointing
solid), and 200 (diamond solid) μM of C-13 in PEM
buffer. Assembly kinetics was monitored at 350 nm (37 °C). (B)
Percentage inhibition of polymerization against the C-13 concentration was plotted. The experiment was carried out four times.
One of the four sets is shown. (C) Tubulin (18 μM) was incubated
without (box solid) and with different concentrations: 30 (circle
solid), 60 (triangle up solid), 100 (triangle down solid), and 150
(triangle left-pointing solid) μM of C-13 in PEM
buffer on ice for 10 min. Subsequently, 10 μM taxol was added
to the reaction mixture followed by 1 mM guanosine 5′-triphosphate
(GTP). Kinetics of the tubulin assembly was monitored by taking absorbance
at 350 nm (37 °C). (D) Percentage inhibition of polymerization
against the C-13 concentration was plotted. Three sets
of experiments were performed. One of the three sets is shown.

C-13 Induced
Apoptosis in HeLa Cells
C-13 treatment increased
the number of dead cells (Figure 12A). For example,
the percentages of PI-stained positive cells in the absence and presence
of 75 and 200 nM C-13 were 6, 42, and 74%. Under similar
conditions, the percentage of PI-stained positive cells in HeLa cells
treated with 20 nM CA-4 was 87%. Cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP), which is mainly involved in DNA repair, acts as a marker for
apoptosis.78 On western blot analysis,
a single band of PARP (116 kDa) was observed in vehicle-treated HeLa
cells, whereas two bands (116 and 89 kDa) were observed in HeLa cells
treated with 75 and 200 nM C-13, confirming the cleavage
of PARP (Figure 12B).

Figure 12 C-13 induced apoptosis and increased the production
of ROS in HeLa cells. (A) HeLa cells were incubated without and with
75 and 200 nM C-13 for 24 h. PI staining was carried
out. Two independent sets of experiments were performed. The scale
bar is 10 μm. (B) HeLa cells were treated without and with 75
and 200 nM C-13 for 24 h. C-13 treatment
produced PARP cleavage. β-Actin was used as a loading control.
The experiment was carried out three times. One of the blots is shown.
(C) HeLa cells were treated without and with 75 and 200 nM C-13, 20 nM CA-4, and 100 μM H2O2 and incubated
for 6 h. Cells were incubated with DCFDA (25 μM) dye for 1 h
at 37 °C in dark. Fluorescence intensity per cell at 525 nm was
calculated, and statistical significance was deduced using student’s t-test. Three sets of experiments were performed independently.
(*: p < 0.05; **: p < 0.01;
***: p < 0.001). The error bar represents standard
deviation.

C-13 Increased
the Intracellular Reactive Oxygen
Species in HeLa Cells
The detection of the intracellular
reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentration was carried out using
2′,7′-dichloro fluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) dye.79C-13 treatment increased the intracellular
ROS concentration in HeLa cells (Figure 12C). The fluorescence intensity of DCFDA
per cell in the absence and presence of 75 and 200 nM C-13 was determined to be 2.4 ± 0.1, 3.0 ± 0.1, and 3.9 ±
0.2 (Figure 12C).
The fluorescence intensity of DCFDA per cell was determined to be
3.6 ± 0.4 and 4.5 ± 0.2 when HeLa cells were treated with
20 nM CA-4 and 100 μM H2O2, respectively.
A brief exposure (2 h) of C-13 produced a significant
depolymerization of microtubules in HeLa cells, while it did not stimulate
ROS. For example, the intensity of microtubules reduced significantly
by 33 ± 8% (p < 0.0001) upon 2 h of incubation
with 200 nM C-13 (Figure S9A), while the fluorescence intensity of ROS was increased by only
2.8 ± 1%. The results indicated that the depolymerization of
microtubules preceded ROS production.

C-13 Retarded
A549 Cell Migration
Combretastatins
are known to be vascular-targeting agents, so we checked the effect
of C-13 on the migration of A549 cells using a wound-closure
assay (Figure 13).
The wound was completely healed in 10 h in the vehicle-treated control
cells. However, after 10 h, the wound was only partly healed in C-13-treated cells (Figure S15A), and 100 and 200 nM C-13 inhibited the migration of
A549 cells by 50 ± 14 and 58 ± 13%, respectively (Figure 13). C-13 also affected the rate of migration of A549 cells (Figure S15B). The rate of migration in vehicle-treated cells
was found to be 3 ± 0.7 μm/h, while in 100 and 200 nM C-13-treated cells, the rate of migration was found to be
1.6 ± 0.3 and 1.1 ± 0.1 μm/h, respectively. A549 cells
treated with 100 nM CA-4 inhibited the migration by 77 ± 5% and
retarded the rate to 0.4 ± 0.2 μm/h.

Figure 13 C-13 inhibited
the migration of A549 cells. The wound
made by a scratch was allowed to heal without or in the presence of
100 and 200 nM C-13. Three sets of experiments were carried
out. The scale bar is 10 μm.

Conclusions
In conclusion, twenty-one
combretastatin-inspired analogues were
investigated for their anticancer activity using cultured cells. The
structure modulation of combretastatins involved the incorporation
of the 2-aminoimidazole-carbonyl group as a double bond replacement
motif that possesses a pharmacodynamically interesting pattern of
H-bond acceptors/donors as well as provides the requisite syn-orientation
of aryls, relevant heteroaryls, or functionalized aryls in ring B,
and the switch of two aryls. Here, we report the highly potent tubulin-targeting
antiproliferative agent C-13 that possesses thiophene
as ring B. It is the most active among the compounds investigated
and shows strong differential activity against cancerous and noncancerous
cells in culture. The evidence presented in the study suggests that C-13 inhibits the proliferation of cells by targeting microtubules
similar to CA-4 and colchicine. The present study thus will aid in
the rational structural modulation of clinical agents that target
the colchicine-binding site in tubulin and may provide guidance in
the synthesis of novel tubulin-targeting anticancer agents with improved
efficacy.

Experimental Section
General Remarks
C-13 was screened for
PAINS using several biochemical assays. The results suggested that C-13 is not a PAINS molecule. First, C-13 was
found to inhibit the binding of colchicine to tubulin in a concentration-dependent
manner with a Ki of 1.1 ± 0.13 μM.
To determine the specificity of C-13 binding, we checked
whether C-13 could bind to proteins such as bovine serum
albumin (BSA), lysozyme, trypsin, and Streptococcus
pneumoniae FtsZ. C-13 was found not to
bind to any of these proteins.

To examine whether C-13 affects the activity of any unrelated targets, we determined the
effect of C-13 on polymerization of S.
pneumoniae FtsZ, a bacterial homolog of tubulin, and
also on the enzymatic activity of alkaline phosphatase. C-13 did not affect the polymerization of S. pneumoniae FtsZ. Further, C-13 did not inhibit the enzymatic activity
of alkaline phosphatase. These experiments together strongly suggest
that the anti-tubulin activity shown by C-13 is not an
artifact. In addition, C-13 satisfies Lipinski’s
rule of five for drug-likeness.80

General
Considerations
Organic substrates, reagents,
and solvents were utilized as obtained from commercial suppliers without
their additional purification. The progress of the organic reactions
was monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC) (Merck, silica gel
60 F254). The acquisition of the NMR spectra was done on
a Bruker Avance DPX 400 MHz spectrometer using solvent CDCl3, DMSO-d6, or CD3OD and tetramethylsilane
as an internal standard. J values are calculated
in Hz. HRMS (ESI) spectrometric data were obtained in a Bruker-maXis
mass instrument. IR spectra of samples as thin films (neat) were recorded
on a Nicolet FT-IR Impact 410 instrument. High-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) (Shimadzu LC-6AD system) was used to analyze
the purity of the synthesized compounds. The HPLC method involves
the Phenomenex RP-C18 column (250 × 4.60 mm), particle size 5
μm, water–acetonitrile as an eluting solvent system,
and a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The purity of all the compounds was found
to be >95%.

General Experimental Procedure for the Synthesis
of 4-Aryl-5-aroyl-1H-imidazole-2-amines (1–7, 9, 11–21)
The compounds
were prepared
following our previously reported method.67 A sealed tube was made oven-dried. It was set up with a rubber septum
and a magnetic bar under a nitrogen atmosphere (flow of nitrogen gas).
In the sealed tube, α-bromochalcone (E/Z-mixture, 0.5 mmol), guanidine·HCl (1.5 mmol, 143
mg, 3 equiv), potassium carbonate (1.75 mmol, 242 mg, 3.5 equiv),
and manganese dioxide (0.75 mmol, 65 mg, 1.5 equiv) were subsequently
taken. Then, the solvent dioxane (anhyd., 8 mL) was added, and the
tube with chemicals and nitrogen gas was sealed. The mixture of components
was then heated with stirring at 100 °C. The progress of the
transformation was checked by TLC. After maximum conversion (16 h),
the resultant mixture was cooled down to room temperature, diluted
with EtOAc–MeOH (1:1, 60 mL), and filtered through celite.
The rotary evaporator-vacuum pump was used to evaporate the solvent(s)
from the solution. The crude mass was subjected to column chromatographic
purification–isolation on silica gel (100–200 mesh),
which was partially acid-neutralized by passing a small volume (1–4
mL) of triethylamine base. MeOH–EtOAc (5:95) was used as the
eluting solvent. 4-Aryl and 5-aroyl substituted 1H-imidazole-2-amines (compounds 1–7, 9, 11–21) were obtained. The molecular constitutions
of these investigated compounds were identified by spectroscopic data
(1H and 13C NMR, IR) and confirmed by HRMS.
The samples were found to be >95% pure by HPLC analysis.

The
spectroscopic data and the scanned spectra of the compounds 1–7, 9, 11–21 were
published in our previously reported article.67

General Procedure for Debenzylation of Compounds 7 and 9 toward the Synthesis of Compounds 8 and 10, Respectively
Compound 7 or compound 9 (0.5 mmol) was taken in a round bottom
flask, and degassed anhydrous MeOH (3.5 mL) was added under nitrogen.
Palladium on carbon (10%) was added. The mixture was stirred under
hydrogen atmosphere. The progress of the reaction was monitored by
TLC. After completion of the reaction, the mixture was diluted with
EtOAc–MeOH (1:1, 60 mL). The resultant mixture was filtered
through celite. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure
(rotary evaporator). The column chromatographic purification of crude
mass was performed on silica gel (100–200 mesh) partially deacidified
by passing triethylamine (1–4 mL). MeOH–EtOAc (5:95)
as eluting solvent was used. It provided 4-aryl-5-aroyl-1H-imidazole-2-amines (compound 8 or compound 10).

Cell Culture
HeLa, MCF-7, MCF 10A, A549, L929, and
B16F10 were bought from National Centre for Cell Sciences (NCCS),
Pune, India. The drug-resistant EMT6/AR1 cell line was bought from
Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA. HeLa and MCF-7 were maintained using Eagle’s
minimal essential medium. L929 and B16F10 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), whereas A549 cells were cultured
in F-12K nutrient medium, supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine
serum and 1% (v/v) antibiotic–antimycotic solution as described
earlier.81 The EMT6/AR1 cell line was maintained
as described previously.44 MCF 10A was
grown in DMEM and F12K in a 1:1 ratio supplemented with 10% (v/v)
fetal bovine serum, 1% (v/v) antibiotic–antimycotic solution,
epidermal growth factor (20 ng/mL), hydrocortisone (0.5 μg/mL),
and insulin (10 μg/mL).82 All the
cells were grown in optimized conditions in a humidified incubator
in 5% CO2 at 37 °C (Sanyo, Tokyo, Japan).

Screening of
Combretastatin Analogues
A cell-based
screening assay was performed to check the antiproliferative potential
of the 21 synthesized compounds. The stocks of the combretastatin
analogues were prepared in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (cell culture
grade). The compounds (1–21) were screened in
HeLa cells using sulforhodamine B assay.69 Briefly, HeLa cells (10 000 cells/well) were incubated for
24 h in 96-well cell culture plates in a humidified CO2 incubator. Then, the cells were incubated with either vehicle (0.1%
DMSO) or 25 nM of each of the compounds for 24 h. After the incubation,
the cells were fixed using 50% trichloroacetic acid for 1 h at 4 °C,
washed, completely dried, and subsequently incubated with sulforhodamine
B (0.4% in 1% acetic acid) for 1 h, followed by washing with 1% glacial
acetic acid. When the plates dried completely, tris chloride (10 mM,
pH 10.0) was added to the wells and incubated for 30 min at room temperature.
Absorbance was measured at 520 nm using Spectramax M2e,
and the inhibition of cell proliferation was determined.

Determination
of IC50
A549 cells (10 000
cells/well) were incubated for 24 h in a 96-well cell culture plate.
Then, the cells were incubated with different concentrations of the
7 active compounds for 24 h and further processed for sulforhodamine
B assay.69

The IC50 values
were calculated using GraphPad software version 6.0 (GraphPad Software,
CA, USA) by fitting the values in an equation from nonlinear regression81  where Y is the response, X is the logarithmic concentration of the compound, Bottom
is the minimum response, Top is the maximum response, and IC50 is the concentration of the compound that gives a response mid-way
between Top and Bottom.

The IC50 values for both C-13 and C-21 in L929 and B16F10 and C-13 in HeLa, MCF-7,
MCF 10A, and EMT6/AR1 cells were obtained similarly by incubating
the cells for one cell cycle. All IC50 values were determined
three times independently for each of the cell lines.

Immunofluorescence
Assay
Immunofluorescence assay was
performed as described previously.83 Briefly,
HeLa or A549 cells (2.5 × 104 cells/well) were seeded
onto glass coverslips and incubated for 24 h. HeLa cells and A549
cells were treated either with the vehicle (0.1% DMSO) or with 100
and 200 nM of C-13. Immunostaining was performed by staining
the cells with α-tubulin antibody (1:400), γ-tubulin (1:
300), and phospho-histone H3 (serine 10) antibody (1:400) and diluting
in 2% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 3 h at room temperature
or overnight at 4 °C. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated
IgG secondary antibody (1:400 dilution in 2% BSA in PBS) was later
added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at room temperature.44 DNA was stained with Hoechst 33258 (10 μg/mL).
The percentage of the multipolar spindle in the absence and presence
of C-13 was determined by scoring 300 mitotic cells in
each of the experimental conditions. The images were captured using
an Eclipse TE 2000U microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) at 60× magnification
and processed with Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Silver
Spring, MD). Similarly, immunostaining was performed by treating HeLa
cells with 35 and 70 nM C-21 and A549 cells with 300
and 600 nM C-21 as stated above.

Drug Retention Experiment
HeLa cells were treated with
the vehicle (0.1% DMSO) and 200 nM C-13 and incubated
for 1 h in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Later, the cells
were washed thrice with Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline,
and fresh media was added to the flasks. After 24 h, the cells were
processed for live/dead assay by flow cytometry using 5 μL of
PI (50 μg/mL) and analyzed on a BD FACSAria instrument (BD,
San Jose, CA, USA).

Determination of the Amount of Soluble and
Polymeric Tubulin
in Cells after C-13 Treatment
The effect of C-13 on the polymerized amount of tubulin in HeLa cells was
determined by western blot as described earlier.83 HeLa cells (in T-25 flasks) were incubated in the absence
and presence of 120 and 240 nM C-13 for 24 h. After 24
h, the cell pellet was collected and added to the pellet PEM buffer
with 25% glycerol and 0.5% Triton X-100 without disturbing the pellet.
It was then incubated for 2 min at 37 °C, and the supernatant
was removed gently from the top of the cell pellet. The supernatant
represents the soluble fraction of tubulin. From the remaining cell
pellet, lysates were prepared84 by incubating
the cells with lysis buffer [tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris)
20 mM, NaCl 200 mM, Triton X-100—0.1%, dithiothreitol (DTT)
1 mM at pH 7.2] for 1 h at 4 °C followed by centrifugation and
collection of supernatants representing the polymeric fraction of
tubulin. The protein concentrations for both the fractions of tubulin
were measured by Bradford’s assay.85 Protein (20 μg) from both the soluble and polymeric fraction
was taken and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The protein band was transferred
onto the poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) membrane via electro-blotting.
Immunoblotting was carried out using the α-tubulin monoclonal
antibody, and the intensity of the bands was analyzed using ImageJ
software.

Effect of C-13 on EB1 Localization
The
effect of C-13 on the localization of EB1 was studied
in live HeLa cells. HeLa cells were transfected with GFP-EB1 plasmid86 using Lipofectamine 3000 following manufacturer’s
instruction and incubated for 6 h. Fresh media was added after 6 h
and cells were allowed to grow for one cell cycle. Cells were then
treated either with vehicle (0.1% DMSO) or with 35 and 70 nM C-13 and incubated for 24 h. Later, images were captured with
a 60× oil objective using a laser-scanning microscope (Olympus
FluoView 500).

Cell Cycle Analysis
HeLa cells were
incubated with
either the vehicle (0.1% DMSO) or 75 and 200 nM C-13 for
12 h. Subsequently, the cells were trypsinized, washed, and fixed
with chilled ethanol (70%) in PBS. The cells were then incubated with
50 μg/mL PI and 1 μg/mL RNase for 30 min. Analysis of
the cell cycle was performed using the BD FACSAria instrument (BD,
San Jose, CA, USA), and the data were evaluated with ModFit LT version
5.0 (Verity Software House).71

Determination
of the Dissociation Constant (Kd) for
Binding of C-13 to Tubulin
Tubulin was isolated
from the goat brain using two cycles of polymerization
and depolymerization,87 and the concentration
of the purified tubulin was determined using Bradford’s assay.85 Tubulin (2 μM) was incubated without or
with various concentrations (0–40 μM) of C-13 in 25 mM PIPES buffer, pH 6.8 for 30 min at 25 °C. The tryptophan
fluorescence was assessed in the absence and presence of C-13 using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm in a cuvette of 0.3 cm
path length using a spectrofluorometer (JASCO FP-6500, Tokyo, Japan).
Inner filter effect correction was performed for the measured fluorescence
intensities using the formula88  where Fcorrected is the corrected fluorescence
intensity, Fobserved is the observed fluorescence
intensity, Aexcitation is the absorbance
of the compound at the excitation
wavelength (295 nm), and Aemission is
the absorbance of the compound at the emission wavelength (335 nm).

The dissociation constant (Kd) was
calculated using GraphPad software version 6.0 (GraphPad Software,
CA, USA) using the following equation  where ΔF is the difference
in the fluorescence intensity on binding with the compound, ΔFmax is the maximum difference in the fluorescence
intensity when the compound saturates the binding site of tubulin, P0 is the concentration of tubulin, and L0 is the concentration of the compound. A similar
experiment was carried out with C-21.

Determination
of the Binding Site of C-13 on Tubulin
Tubulin
(5 μM) was mixed with several concentrations (0–70
μM) of C-13 in PIPES buffer (25 mM, pH 6.8) for
15 min at 37 °C. Colchicine (10 μM) was then added to the
reaction milieu and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. Fluorescence
spectra (410–500 nm) were recorded using an excitation wavelength
of 340 nm in a cuvette of path length 0.3 cm using a spectrofluorometer
(JASCO FP-6500, Tokyo, Japan). The experiment was done four times.
The inhibition constant (Ki) was calculated
using GraphPad software version 6.0 (GraphPad Software, CA, USA) by
fitting the difference in fluorescence intensity using the following
equation89  where Ki is an
inhibition constant, EC50 is the concentration of C-13 at which the fluorescence intensity was reduced to half, L is the concentration of C-13, and Kd is the dissociation constant of the binding
of colchicine to tubulin.44 A similar experiment
was carried out with C-21.

Competition Assay with
Compound 12
Compound 12 was
reported to bind at the colchicine-binding site on tubulin.44 Tubulin (2 μM) was incubated either without
or with different concentrations (2–60 μM) of C-13 in 25 mM PIPES buffer, pH 6.8 for 20 min at 37 °C. Later, compound
12 (5 μM) was added into the reaction milieu and incubated for
10 min at room temperature. Fluorescence spectra (410–500 nm)
were monitored using 350 nm as the excitation wavelength in a cuvette
of path length 0.3 cm using a spectrofluorometer (JASCO FP-6500, Tokyo,
Japan). The fluorescence intensities were corrected for the inner
filter effect in the presence of C-13 and the inhibition
of the binding of compound 12 to tubulin by different concentrations
of C-13 was determined.

Molecular Docking Analysis
of C-13
To
find the putative binding site of C-13 on the tubulin
dimer, molecular docking was performed using AutoDock 4.290 using the protocol as described earlier.76 The three-dimensional atomic co-ordinates for C-13 were obtained using the PRODRG server.91 Briefly, global docking for colchicine (PDB: 1SA0),77 CA-4 (PDB: 5LYJ)75 and C-13 was performed individually on the tubulin dimer using a grid box
that covered the entire surface of the tubulin dimer. Because the
maximum number of conformations for all these molecules was found
to be at the interface of the tubulin dimer, local docking was performed
at the tubulin interface only.

A grid box of 56 × 60 ×
58 Å with a spacing of 0.375 Å was used to cover the tubulin
dimer interface to perform local docking, and 50 independent docking
jobs were carried out, each of 100 runs to obtain 5000 conformations.
An RMSD cut off of 4 Å was used for clustering of the conformations
and analysis of binding energies using AutoDock 4.2. The interaction
with tubulin was analyzed using UCSF Chimera version 1.11.92

Effect of C-13 on MAP-Rich Tubulin
Polymerization
MAP-rich tubulin was purified as described
earlier.84 MAP-rich tubulin (2 mg/mL) was
incubated in
the absence and presence of different concentrations (5, 10, 20, 50,
100, and 200 μM) of C-13 in PEM (25 mM PIPES pH
6.8, 3 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA) buffer for 10 min on ice. Subsequently,
GTP (1 mM) was added to the reaction mixture, and the kinetics of
microtubule assembly was assessed at 37 °C by light scattering
(at 350 nm) using a spectrofluorometer.

Effect of C-13 on Taxol-Induced Tubulin Polymerization
Tubulin (18 μM)
was incubated without and with different
concentrations (30, 60, 100, and 150 μM) of C-13 in PEM buffer on ice for 10 min. Subsequently, taxol and GTP were
added to the reaction mixture to a final concentration of 10 μM
taxol and 1 mM GTP. The kinetics of tubulin assembly was assessed
by taking the absorbance of the reaction mixture at 350 nm, 37 °C
using Spectramax M2e.

PI Staining
HeLa
cells (2.5 × 104 cells/well)
were seeded onto glass coverslips and incubated for 24 h. The cells
were then treated either with vehicle (0.1% DMSO) or with 75 and 200
nM C-13 and 20 nM CA-4 for 24 h. The plates were centrifuged
at 2500 rpm for 15 min and washed with PBS. Live/dead cell staining
with an FITC-Annexin V apoptosis detection kit (BD Biosciences, San
Jose, CA, USA) was carried out.71 Cells
were incubated with 5 μL of PI solution (50 μg/mL) and
incubated for 15 min at room temperature in dark. Images were captured
using an Eclipse TE 2000U microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) at 60×
magnification and processed with Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics,
Silver Spring, MD).

Confirmation of Apoptosis by PARP Cleavage
HeLa cells
were treated with 75 and 200 nM C-13 and 20 nM CA-4 in
T-25 flasks for 24 h. After 24 h, cells were scrapped and lysed with
lysis buffer (Tris 20 mM, NaCl 200 mM, Triton X-100, 0.1%, DTT 1 mM
at pH 7.2). The protein concentration was determined by Bradford’s
assay, and 100–200 μg of the proteins was loaded onto
the SDS-PAGE gel. The protein band was transferred onto the PVDF membrane
via electroblotting. Immunoblotting was carried out using the anti-PARP
monoclonal antibody and anti-β-actin antibody (loading control).81

Effect of C-13 on Generation
of ROS
Production
of intracellular ROS was quantified using DCFDA dye. HeLa cells (2
× 105 cells/mL) were seeded in 24-well cell culture
plates and treated either with vehicle (0.1% DMSO) or with C-13 (75 and 200 nM) and incubated for 6 h. CA-4 (20 nM) was used for
comparison, while H2O2 was used as a positive
control. In a separate assay, HeLa cells were treated without and
with 200 nM C-13 for 2 h and the amount of ROS generated
was estimated after 2 h of C-13 treatment. The cells
were collected by centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 10 min and washed
twice with PBS. Counting of cells was carried out using trypan blue
dye. Cells were then incubated with DCFDA dye (25 μM) in dark
at 37 °C for 1 h. Fluorescence spectra (510–600 nm) were
monitored using an excitation wavelength of 488 nm.93 Fluorescence intensity per cell at 525 nm was calculated,
and statistical significance was deduced using student’s t-test.

Scratch Wound Healing Assay
A549
cells were seeded
on coverslips (1 × 105 cells or up to 90% confluency).
After the attachment of the cells, a wound was created on the coverslip
by a sterile 10 μL micropipette tip.44 The coverslips were then treated with 0, 100, and 200 nM of C-13, and differential interference contrast images were taken
at different time intervals (0, 6, and 10 h or till the wound healed)
to see the effect of C-13 on wound closure. The percentage
of wound healed was calculated using Image-Pro Plus software (Media
Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD).
