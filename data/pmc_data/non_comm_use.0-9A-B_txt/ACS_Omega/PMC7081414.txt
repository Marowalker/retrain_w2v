Both
theory and experiment show that sp2 carbon nanomaterials
doped with N have great potential as high-efficiency catalysts for
oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). At present, there are theoretical
studies that believe that C-sites with positive charge or high-spin
density values have higher adsorption capacity, but there are always
some counter examples, such as the N-doped graphene nanoribbons with
edge defects (ND-GNR) of this paper. In this study, the ORR mechanism
of ND-GNR was studied by density functional theory (DFT) calculation,
and then the carbon ring resonance energy was analyzed from the perspective
of chemical graph theory to elucidate the cause and distribution of
active sites in ND-GNR. Finally, it was found that the overpotential
of the model can be adjusted by changing the width of the model or
dopant atoms while still ensuring proper adsorption energy (between
0.5 and 2.0 eV). The minimum overpotential for these models is approximately
0.36 V. These findings could serve as guidelines for the construction
of efficient ORR carbon nanomaterial catalysts.

1 Introduction
In hydrogen fuel cells,
the efficiency of converting
chemical energy of hydrogen and oxygen into electrical energy depends
on the electrocatalytic performance of the catalyst for sluggish cathodic
oxygen reduction reactions (ORR).1 At present,
Pt and Pt-alloy catalysts are the most widely used for commercial
purposes, because of their superior ORR activity.2 Nevertheless, high cost and their lack of abundance hinder
the successful commercialization of the hydrogen fuel cells. Moreover,
Pt-based catalysts also suffers from severe agglomerations and leaching
of the alloy metal, surface-positioning with gaseous molecules such
as CO and liquid fuels like methanol, under electrochemical conditions
and hence their catalytic performance deteriorates over long term
operation.3,4 Therefore, it is essential to develop the
efficient, cost-effective, and stable catalysts, which can replace
the traditional Pt-based catalysts with similar efficiency, and this
has been the problem that is being addressed since the last 2 decades.
In this regard, the catalyst with no metal component involved (metal-free)
is gaining much attention, as they do not possess many of the disadvantages
of Pt-based catalysts. Because they do not possess any metallic particles,
there is no agglomeration of the nanoparticles. Moreover, they are
resistance to CO and methanol species and they are stable under electrochemical
conditions.5 Therefore, attention is being
paid on the development of heteroatom-doped catalysts (metal-free
catalysts) especially on nitrogen-doped catalysts.

It is found
by many researches that the doping of N into the sp2-based
carbon nanomaterials could be the right choice to engineer the electronic
structures of the sp2-based carbon nanomaterials suitable
for the ORR catalysis. At the same time, both theory and experiment
show that sp2 carbon nanomaterials doped with N have great
potential as high-efficiency catalysts,2,6,7 by changing the polarity of the adjacent carbon materials
for successful O2 adsorption and reduction to H2O. Though there are many studies published on the experimental evidences
on the ORR activity of N-doped carbon materials, still their basic
understanding on how the different types of N chemical states and
dopant bonding configuration in the carbon substrate, effect of defects
(edge or basal) of the substrate on the absorption properties of gaseous
O2, and the binding energies of the ORR intermediates are
still worth exploring. It is very important to understand each of
these effects in a fundamental way, to design more efficient catalysts.
Thanks, to density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which can
be used as a fundamental and efficient tool to understand the adsorption
energies of O2, activation barriers for various ORR intermediates,
estimation of electronic density on the catalyst surface, and effect
of defects on the carbon substrate on the atomic level.8 DFT calculations also predict the possible ORR
activity of new catalysts and hence are a power tool for many theoretical
scientists.

Graphene nanoribbons possess a large aspect ratio
and numerous defects along their edge structures9,10 and
experimentally it is also easy to obtain by the unzipping of carbon
nanotubes by various chemical processes.11,12 In
this article, our calculations show the importance of edge defect
sites on N-doped graphene nanoribbon supports, which is due to its
influence on the adsorption performance. For the N-doped carbon materials,
the ORR reaction proceeds with the adsorption of O2/H+. It is important to have an optimum adsorption of O2, as weak adsorption lead to a slow ORR process. There are two possibilities
by which an ORR reaction can proceed. The first possibility is that
oxygen is directly adsorbed on the catalyst and then reduced with
(H+ + e–). The second possibility is
that the weakly adsorbed oxygen first combines with the proton to
form the precursor OOH+ and then the reaction proceeds
further with the addition of more protons to form H2O.13 Correlation calculations show that if the adsorption
process is consistent with the description of the second viewpoint,
the adsorption reaction requires certain activation energy.14 Thus, the adsorption reaction conforming to
the first view is more kinetically advantageous. Usually, after doping
a small amount of the N element, the direct oxygen adsorption capacity
of C nanomaterials is weak,15−18 and hence many studies believe
that the adsorption reaction is more likely to follow the second possibility.19−21

It has been pointed out
in previous studies that N atoms have larger electronegativity than
the carbon and hence N atoms cannot be considered as the O2 adsorption sites. These studies also indicate that those carbon
atoms with positive charge/positive spin density values around the
N dopant possess the great adsorption capacities with gaseous O2.15,19,22,23 In fact, the adsorption energy depends on the energy
changes of the entire system before and after the adsorption process.
Thus, the adsorption performance of the active site is not only associated
with local characteristics of the catalytic material. In particular,
the relationship between the resonance energy associated with the
topology (a global characteristic) of the substrate and the adsorption
capacity of the substrate is rarely mentioned in previous theoretical
studies.

In this study, we used graphene nanoribbons, a common
sp2 carbon nanomaterial containing the hexagonal lattices
doped with N atoms, as the substrate for understanding the ORR mechanism.
The doping of the N element and particularly the effect of edge defects
has been investigated (this edge defect has been confirmed to exist
in experiments24,25). Under the investigated theoretical
conditions, N-doped graphene nanoribbons with the edge defect (ND-GNR)
ORR process by analyzing various ORR mechanistic parameters. In addition,
the change of resonance energy before and after O2 adsorption
of ND-GNR was analyzed from the perspective of chemical graph theory
to explain the cause and distribution of active sites in ND-GNR. Finally,
the case of changing the width of the model and the doping atoms was
also considered and briefly analyzed. The significance of this research
is to propose a model that theoretically has both low overpotential
and good adsorption performance. In addition, the analysis of the
changes in the resonance energy of the substrate can explain the phenomenon
that some negatively charged C sites are active. Because it is difficult
to directly calculate the difference in resonance energy, qualitative
analysis is performed here using chemical graph theory to make the
analysis more intuitive. This study provides more ideas for building
a model of good ORR activity.

2 Computational Details
DFT computational simulations
were performed using the dmol3 program.26,27 The generalized
gradient approximation with Perdew Burke Ernzerhof was chosen for
the analysis of exchange–correlation energy.28 The core treatment parameter used in the calculations was
selected as all electron and the basis was the double numerical plus
polarization.26 The track cutoff radius
was set as 4.2 Å. A smearing value of 0.005 Ha made the calculations
easier to converge. The convergence tolerance of energy, force, and
displacement were set as 10–5 Ha, 0.001 Ha/Å,
and 0.005 Å, respectively. The Grimme dispersion correction method
was chosen to calculate the interaction between molecules.29 The conductor-like screening model (COSMO)30,31 were used to simulate the aqueous solvent environment for the calculation
and the dielectric constant was set as 78.54. The charge distribution
is judged by analyzing the Mulliken charge.32

The adsorption energy of adsorbed molecules on the substrate
is defined by the formula: Ead = Emol+sub – Emol – Esub, where Esub, Emol, and Emol+sub were the total energy of substrate, ORR intermediates,
and the most stable adsorption configuration, respectively. Thermodynamic
calculations were based on the model proposed by Nørskov et al.33,34 The overall free energy change (ΔG) is calculated
by ΔG = ΔE + ΔZPE
– TΔS + ΔGU + ΔGpH,
ZPE is zero-point energy and S is the entropy. ZPE
and entropy can be obtained by calculating the vibration frequency.
ΔGU represents the effect of the
electrode potential that is equal to −eU,
where U is the potential difference between the two
poles and e is the basic positive charge. ΔGpH is the effect of the solvation environment
that is equal to −kT ln10 × pH, where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is chosen
as 298.15 K. This study assumes that the pH of the solution is 0,
so the ΔGpH is 0 eV in all calculations.34 The ground state of an oxygen molecule is a
triplet state, and it is usually avoided to directly calculate its
free energy. Instead, the free energy is calculated indirectly using
an equation: GO2(g) = GH2O(l) – GH2(g) + 4.92 eV. The GH2O(l) can be obtained by calculating GH2O(g) at a pressure of 0.035 bar because the
pressure of 0.035 bar can equalize the chemical potential of the liquid
water molecules and the gaseous water molecules at 298.15 K.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 ORR Mechanism on ND-GNR
The structure of ND-GNR is shown in the Figure 1. As discussed already, the adsorption gaseous
O2 is the initial step of ORR. By analyzing the possibility
of various sites, it can be found that gaseous O2 is spontaneously
adsorbed only on two C carbon atoms (C1 and C1′) near the N
dopant. As shown in the Figure 2, the adsorption of O2 on C1 and C1′ carbon
atoms can produce two configurations [initial state (IS) and final
state (FS) of Figure 2], but one is metastable. The metastable configuration can be converted
to the stable configuration after overcoming a small energy barrier
(Figure 2). The calculation
of adsorption energy only considers the most stable configuration,
so the adsorption energy of ND-GNR was about −1.08 eV. It is
necessary to state that the C1 and C1′ site in the ND-GNR have
negative charges (Mulliken charge population, Figure S1), and some C sites have positive charges (such as
the C atom adjacent to the N atom, these sites do not actually adsorb
oxygen). Moreover, the electron spin density value of each atom in
the calculation results in 0. Therefore, the cause of the adsorption
capacity needs to be considered from other aspects.

the gray ball, and the blue ball represent the H atom, the C atom,
and the N atom, respectively.

and the structures of the IS, the transient state (TS), and the FS.
The figure also includes the reaction heat and reaction barrier.

After the
adsorption reaction, adsorbed oxygen will react with (H+ + e–). According to previous studies, this reaction
may follow two main mechanisms: the dissociation mechanism and the
association mechanism.23 For the dissociation
mechanism: the adsorbed oxygen dissociates into *O + *O, which further
reacts with (H+ + e–), where * represents
a substrate site. For the association mechanism: adsorbed oxygen does
not dissociate, and directly reacts with (H+ + e–) to form *OOH. The *OOH formed through the association mechanism
has the possibility to produce hydrogen peroxide in the consecutive
reaction with (H+ + e–), which is an
undesired two-electron process. Hence, it is desirable that the catalysts
developed should undergo a direct dissociative mechanism to form H2O as much as possible, rather than the undesired associative
mechanism to from hydrogen peroxide.23

Our DFT calculation results show that the ORR of ND-GNR follows the
dissociation mechanism with a direct four-electron process to form
H2O. The reason is that the dissociation of adsorbed oxygen
only needs to overcome a small energy barrier (Figure 3). Moreover, the product of the dissociation
mechanism has a hydrogen bond and thus is very stable (Figure 5c). On the other hand, the product of the association mechanism,
*OOH is relatively unstable and can be converted to the above configuration
(Figure 4). At the
same time, the formation of *OOH releases less energy. When the voltage
of the two poles is increased, the potential of e– becomes lower, which is disadvantageous for forming *OOH. Finally,
under the dissociation mechanism, according to the free energy of
each intermediate product, the ORR of ND-GNR can be divided into the
following steps 1   2   3   4   5

According to the above ORR path, a free energy step diagram of ND-GNR
can be obtained (Figure 6). In addition, the overpotential of ND-GNR is about 0.45 V, which
indicates that ND-GNR has good performance.

Figure 6 Free energy
diagrams for the ORR pathway on ND-GNR in an acidic environment (pH
= 0).

In the above discussion,
(H+ + e–) in reactions 2–5 acts as the
reactant, and (H+ + e–) indicates that
H+ and electrons are isolated from each other. In the products
of the reactions 2–5, H+ and e– are combined
into a hydrogen atom. Previous theoretical studies have shown that
there may be two mechanisms for the combination process: the Langmuir–Hinshelwood
(LH) mechanism and the Eley–Rideal (ER) mechanism.35 The difference between these two mechanisms
is that the sites in the combination process are different. In the
LH mechanism, a proton first combines with an electron on the surface
of the catalyst to form *H, and then *H reacts with the intermediate
product; in the ER mechanism, a proton acquires an electron directly
on the oxygen atom in the intermediate product.

For ND-GNR,
it is assumed that ORR occurs through the ER mechanism. First, some
theoretical research on Pt catalytic materials has roughly shown that
the introduction of H atoms in the ER mechanism does not need to overcome
a large energy barrier.36 In addition,
in the study of this paper, the introduction of hydrogen atoms under
the ER mechanism reduces the energy of the system; in the case of
the LH mechanism, the energy of the system increases when *H is formed
in reactions 2–4 (Table S1). For reaction 5, when protons are
converted to *H at C1 or C1′ sites, the energy of the system
can be reduced. Unfortunately, reaction *H + *OH → H2O is less likely to react. This reaction is hardly exothermic and
has a reaction barrier of about 1.0 eV. Although this reaction can
become exothermic by increasing the width of the model (Figure S2), the reaction barrier of the reaction
is hardly reduced. Thus, once the *H + *OH configuration is formed,
it may mean that the ND-GNR will lose ORR activity. However, the relevant
calculations suggest that the introduction of hydrogen atoms may happen
through a special approach. The proton is likely to not directly reach
the oxygen atom of the intermediate product. Instead, a special structure
is first formed: a proton is linked to the oxygen atom of the intermediate
product by hydrogen bonding interactions using several water molecules
as bridges, and then under the activation of a certain energy, the
hydrogen atom adjacent to the oxygen atom of the intermediate product
is converted into a proton.37 This mechanism
increases the likelihood that the last step of the reaction will occur
through the ER mechanism. In summary, ORR can be carried out more
smoothly under the ER mechanism than the LH mechanism.

3.2 Effect of Resonance Energy on
Adsorption Energy
The qualitative analysis of resonance energy
in this paper draws on the viewpoint of chemical graph theory. The
effect of resonance energy on the adsorption energy is as follows:
an increase in the resonance energy of the substrate in the adsorption
reaction tends to indicate an increase in the adsorption capacity
of the substrate. Conversely, a decrease in the resonance energy means
that the adsorption capacity of the substrate is decreased. Chemical
graph theory believes that the resonance energies of benzene hydrocarbons
are mainly from those conjugate circuits, and the contributions of
these conjugate circuits are considered to be linearly additive. The
conjugate circuit can be understood as: in a certain Kekule valence
structure, the conjugate circuit is a circuit composed of several
C atoms, and this circuit is connected by a C–C single bond
and C–C double bond in turn.38 There
is the formula for benzene hydrocarbons: 6  where n1, n2, and n3,... represent the number of conjugate circuits R1, R2, and R3,... respectively, and K represents
the number of Kekule valence structures. R1 represents the contribution of a conjugate circuit composed of 6
C atoms to resonance energy, R2 represents
a contribution of a conjugate circuit composed of 10 C atoms to resonance
energy, and Rn represents
the contribution of a conjugate circuit composed of (4n + 2) C atoms to resonance energy.38 In
general, the contribution of the conjugate circuit after R3 can be ignored. The value of Rn is an empirical parameter and different
values should be taken for different types of systems.

The rigorous
approach should be to enumerate the Kekule valence structure of ND-GNR
and the conjugate circuits in each of the Kekule valence structures,
and finally obtain the approximate RE according to formula 6. A simple analysis method is considered here. For
the bond analysis, the resonant representation and the Kekule representation
are used (Figure 7).
The area enclosed by the dashed line uses the resonant representation
to describe the bonding between atoms, which can be converted into
several Kekule valence structures. The conjugate circuit can be extracted
in these areas. The chemical bond between the remaining atoms uses
the Kekule representation.

Figure 7 Resonance structure of ND-GNR before oxygen
adsorption (a–e)
and after oxygen adsorption (f,g).

The ND-GNR can be expressed as the
following resonance structures (Figure 7a–e). The reason is that the C1 atom must have
a double bond and a single bond when bonded to its adjacent carbon
atom (the C1′ atom is also the same). The ND-GNR model, after
oxygen adsorption, can be expressed as two types of resonance structures
(Figure 7f,g). For
models with more Kekule valence structures, studies have shown that
they can be counted by computer programs.39 However, because of the complexity of the Kekule valence structure
caused by this band structure, it is difficult to analyze all the
Kekule valence structures, so the resonance structure containing the
largest resonance region can be selected for analysis. Because usually
these resonance structures contribute the most to the formula 6, while other resonance structures are relatively
smaller.

The C1 and C1′ atoms in the ND-GNR have π
electrons, while in the ND-GNR after oxygen adsorption, the C1 and
C1′ atoms have only σ electrons. Therefore, for each
given Kekule valence structure, when the σ electrons on the
C1 atom and the C1′ atom become π electrons, some conjugate
circuits are always destroyed. It can be seen that in those resonant
structures with large contributions (Figure 7a,c,f), the resonance region of ND-GNR after
oxygen adsorption can always contain the resonance regions of ND-GNR,
and thus each Kekule valence structure of ND-GNR after oxygen adsorption
can provide more conjugate circuits on average. Therefore, the resonance
energy of the ND-GNR after adsorbing oxygen is larger.

In addition,
in the ND-GNR, other C atoms are possible except that the atoms of
C1 and C1′ are unlikely to be in the conjugate circuit (Figure 7a,c). When the π
electrons of these C atoms in the conjugate circuit are converted
into σ electrons (i.e., adsorption reactions occur at these
sites), some conjugate circuits are destroyed, which causes the resonance
energy of the system to decrease. Therefore, the adsorption capacity
of these sites is poor, which is consistent with the detection of
previous adsorption sites. For the same reason, if *H is produced
at these sites on the reactants of reactions 2–4, the same
effect will be produced. This is why the ORR of this model is not
well suited to the LH mechanism in reactions 2–4.

3.3 Effect of the Model Width and
Doping Element
First, the influence of model width on the
adsorption performance of ND-GNR is discussed. It can be speculated
that as the width of the model increases, the magnitude of the fluctuation
of the adsorption energy gradually becomes smaller and eventually
approaches a certain value (Figure S4).
The values of the adsorption energy of these models are still in the
appropriate range, indicating that the change in width can adjust
the adsorption energy to some extent. In addition, the change in width
also affects the free energy of other ORR steps, thus changing the
overpotential of the model. It is worth mentioning that ND-GNR1 has
a lower overpotential of 0.36 V, which is lower than the theoretical
overpotential (0.45 V) of the Pt catalytic material.34 The overpotential depends on the one with the least exotherm
in the reactions 2–5, and the total exothermic amount of the reactions 1–5 is 4.92 eV, so the adsorption energy also affects
the overpotential. Because of this trend of adsorption energy, the
relationship between the overpotential and the width of the model
becomes unclear (Table 1).

Table 1 Adsorption
Energy of Oxygen from Different Substrates
substrate	adsorption energy (eV)	overpotential (eV)	
ND-GNR	–1.08	0.45	
ND-GNR1	–0.89	0.36	
ND-GNR2	–0.76	0.40	
BD-GNR	–0.91	0.40	
PD-GNR	–1.19	0.52	
To
further extend our understanding the effect of B and P dopants,
the N atoms in the ND-GNR1 is replaced with B atoms or P atoms (Figure 8e,g). When B atoms
are doped, B atoms can also act as adsorption sites. For ease of comparison,
the ORR that occurs on the B atom is ignored here. Moreover, according
to previous studies, P atoms are easily passivated by oxygen, which
are described in both experimental and theoretical calculations.40,41 Because the electronegativity of the P atom and the B atom is small,
the doping effect of these atoms is different from that of the N atom
doping. Finally, compared with ND-GNR1, although the exothermic heat
of reaction 2 of PD-GNR
and BD-GNR is reduced, the exothermic heat of reaction 4 is also reduced, which causes the overpotential
to rise. Although the adsorption energy and overpotential of these
models have changed, they are all within the appropriate range, which
indicates that such models have good controllability and great potential.

energy step diagram (b); ND-GNR2 (c) and its free energy step diagram

and its free energy step diagram (h).

4 Conclusions
Some of the carbon sites in the
nonconjugated circuit can be made
active by the synergy of edge defects and dopant atoms, and this effect
is discussed from the perspective of chemical graph theory. When screening
highly active C sites, after enumerating the resonance structures
with larger contributions, attention should be paid to those C atoms
that are not on any conjugate circuit. In addition, by calculating
the ORR path, it is found that the ND-GNR not only has suitable adsorption
energy, but also has a low overpotential. Changing the width of the
model or changing the doping element can appropriately adjust the
ORR activity of the model. From the calculation results of this paper,
as the width increases, the fluctuation of the adsorption energy value
of the model decreases and gradually approaches a certain value. Because
of this tendency to adsorb energy, it is difficult to judge the change
in overpotential as the width of the model increases. However, it
was found by calculation that the overpotential of some models can
reach 0.36 V. The influence of doping elements is more complicated.
According to the calculation results, the doping of elements with
lower electronegativity than carbon will reduce the exotherm of reaction 2, but will also reduce
the exotherm of reaction 4, which makes reaction 4 the least exothermic reaction. Therefore, BD-GNR and PD-GNR also
have high potential. These findings could serve as guidelines for
the construction of efficient ORR carbon nanomaterial catalysts. Theoretical
calculations show that ND-GNR has good ORR activity but this infinite-cycle
structure is an ideal structure. Combined with the actual situation,
ND-GNR can be transformed into a carbon nanotube structure, thereby
inheriting the important attributes of ND-GNR. Inaddition, you can
also get good ORR activity by adjusting the width or doping the atoms.
