Herein, the interface of epoxy and
graphene oxide (GO) is tailored
through hydroxylated poly(ether ether ketone) (HPEEK). The resultant
modification (HPEEK-g-GO) improved the interfacial adhesion between
epoxy and carbon fiber (CF) in the laminates. This strategy resulted
in improved tensile strength, modulus, and storage modulus by 8, 10,
and 26%, respectively, with respect to control samples (epoxy/CF laminates).
The HPEEK-g-GO was thoroughly characterized using spectroscopic techniques
and was infused using vacuum-enhanced resin infusion technology into
the epoxy/CF laminates. To address the challenges involved with primary
agglomeration, the composite formulation was subjected to mechanical
stirring coupled with bath sonication throughout the mixing process.
The improved structural properties in epoxy/CF laminates were attributed
to HPEEK-g-GO “interconnects”, which provided the necessary
reinforcement owing to better interfacial adhesion with the CF mat
as inferred from the fracture surface morphology assessed using SEM.
In addition, the epoxy laminates containing HPEEK-g-GO also showed
flame-retardant properties along with good thermal stability. The
electromagnetic interference shielding capability of the modified
laminates was also evaluated in the frequency range of 12–18
GHz. It was observed that the laminates exhibited a shielding effectiveness
of −50 dB. Thus, this strategy offers some promise in fabricating
epoxy/CF laminates with multifunctional properties through HPEEK-g-GO “interconnects”.

Introduction
The use of carbon fiber
(CF)-reinforced polymer matrix composites
has seen substantial growth in aerospace, transportation, and automotive
because of their high specific strength and modulus and their ability
to be tailored for myriad applications.1−3 At the same time, scientific
efforts have been concentrated on the improvement in interfacial properties
as this significantly impacts the final properties of composites.4−6 Interfacial adhesion is crucial, and interfacial adhesion strength
can, in general, be dominated by two phenomena, namely, chemical bonding
and mechanical interlocking.7,8 Thus, this interfacial
adhesion can be tailored by modifying the matrix using various methods
such as incorporation of nanofillers or “interconnects”
that leads to an improved interface and eventually the mechanical
properties.

Epoxy resins, a dominant thermosetting polymer,
are widely used
because of their superior thermal and mechanical properties in adhesives,
coatings, and structural materials. The benefits of epoxy over other
thermosets have been well documented in the literature.9 Thus, among the various thermosets available,
epoxy resins play a dominant role as a matrix in the development of
high-performance materials because of their excellent thermal stability,
mechanical properties, and processability.1,2 Their
highly cross-linked structure after curing makes them inherently brittle
and prone to cracks, which becomes challenging upon their utility
in structural applications. Therefore, many scientific studies have
been performed with an aim to improve the interface between epoxy
and CF mats.

To this end, there exist studies that discuss different
strategies
to improve the properties of the epoxy resin by addition of various
fibers and also by blending with other thermoplastics.10 Recently, with the use of nanofillers such as
carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene oxide (GO) is also being explored
as modifiers for epoxy resins as it offers exceptional properties.11 GO with abundant functional groups on the basal
plane can be dispersed well in polar polymers.12−15 The main advantage of GO over
other carbon derivatives such as CNTs is the availability of abundant
functional groups, which can be harnessed to improve its dispersion
in epoxy resin.16 GO has a high tendency
to agglomerate because of van der Waals’ forces and strong
π–π stacking.17,18 Therefore,
the recent research is focused on addressing this challenge by functionalizing
the GO sheets.11,19,20

Poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) is a thermoplastic and has
attracted
many researchers because of the exceptional properties that it offers,
which can be utilized for various applications such as high-performance
automotive and space applications.21−23 Hence, in an attempt
to tailor the interfacial adhesion between epoxy and CF, PEEK was
grafted onto GO sheets and used as interconnects. In the present work,
the mechanical properties of epoxy-based laminates were evaluated
in the presence of GO and HPEEK-g-GO utilizing the benefits of HPEEK,
which is miscible with the epoxy prepolymer. The grafting of HPEEK
onto GO improved not only the dispersion of GO in epoxy but also the
interfacial adhesion between epoxy and CF in the laminates. The tensile,
flame retardant, and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding
properties of the laminates were systematically investigated.

Characterization
The synthesis procedure of GO and HPEEK-g-GO is discussed in our
previous work.24 Both GO and modified GO
were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using
an FEI Tecnai T20 S-TWIN, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy,
X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS). Limiting oxygen index (LOI) tests were performed according
to ASTM D2863. The sample size used for the LOI was 70 mm × 6.5
mm × 3 mm (length × width × thickness). The apparatus
used was procured from Concept Equipment Ltd., U.K. The specimen was
mounted on a holder and ignited with a burner so that only the upper
face was exposed to the flame. All the measurements were repeated
3 times, and the average value is reported. The morphology of fractured
tensile specimens was observed under a scanning electron microscope
(SEM; ULTRA 55, FESEM (Carl Zeiss)). Modulated differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC-Q2000 from TA Instruments) was performed to gain
insight into the thermal transitions in the composites. Briefly, the
samples were heated at 2 °C/min with an amplitude of 1 °C
and a period of 60 s. About 70 nm sections of epoxy composites were
trimmed using a Leica Ultramicrotome at room temperature for TEM analysis.
The tensile test of epoxy/CF laminates containing GO or HPEEK-g-GO
was carried out as per ASTM D 3039. The specimen size used for tensile
testing was 250 mm × 12.5 mm × 2 mm. An interlaminar shear
strength (ILSS) test was carried out as per ASTM D 2344. The specimen
size was 20 mm × 10 mm × 2 mm. Dynamic mechanical thermal
analysis (DMTA) was performed using three-point bending on a TA Q800
in the temperature range from 40to 200 °C under a constant vibration
frequency of 1 Hz with an amplitude of 15 μm. EMI shielding
of laminates was studied using an Anritsu MS4642A vector network analyzer
(VNA). KEYCOM waveguide is used to measure the parameters of the thin
layered samples in the 12–18 GHz frequency region.

Results and Discussion
DSC Analysis
of Epoxy/Carbon Fiber Laminates
Tg of the epoxy/CF laminates was studied by MDSC
(see Figure 1). It
is observed that for the neat epoxy/CF laminate, the Tg is ca. 171 °C, which reduced to 167 °C in
the presence of 0.5 wt % GO. Interestingly, the Tg increased to 176 °C in the presence of HPEEK-g-GO
at a similar loading. The decrease in Tg in the case of GO suggests a reduced crosslinking density in epoxy.
Similar observations were reported by Putz et al.25−27 Alternatively,
the literature also reports that upon functionalizing, the GO sheets
can also increase the Tg of the epoxy
composites.28,29 In our case, the increase in Tg in the presence of modified GO is plausibly
due to the improved dispersion of GO due to the functionalization
with PEEK, which, in turn, reduces the macromolecular mobility of
the epoxy chains and increases the Tg.

of epoxy laminates.

Flammability and Thermal
Properties
The flame-retardant
properties of the epoxy resins were examined by measuring the limiting
oxygen index (LOI) as shown in Figure 2. It is well-known that epoxy resins are highly flammable,
with an LOI value of 21.30 With the addition
of CFs, the LOI value increased to 30. It was interesting to note
that with the addition of GO, the LOI values further enhanced marginally.
It showed about 31.5 and 32 for 0. 5 wt % GO and 0.5 wt % HPEEK-g-GO
filled epoxy/CF laminates, respectively. This ultimately indicates
that the addition of small amount of HPEEK-g-GO31 improves the flammability properties as compared to neat
epoxy samples. Figure 3 shows the degradation curves for various epoxy/CF laminates. It
was observed that all epoxy CF laminates containing GO and HPEEK-g-GO
were thermally stable up to 300 °C.

Mechanical Properties
The major challenge with epoxy-based
composites containing nanoparticles is the formation of voids and
microvoids because of several factors such as moisture absorbed during
storing and volatiles released by chemical reactions, which ultimately
results in deterioration of the mechanical properties, especially
the tensile properties.32−34 To avoid the above mentioned
issues, the layup under vacuum was dried in an oven before infusing
with the resin. The resin mixture was also heated up to reduce the
viscosity, which resulted in the easy infiltration and release of
volatiles to a certain level. The curing was carried out keeping the
vacuum suction continuous on the laminate. This almost eliminates
the entrapment of volatiles. The specimens from the cured laminate
were cut using a diamond cutter as per ASTM standard. Glass/epoxy
composite tabs were bonded to the specimens. The tabs were bonded
to protect the surface from damage during clamping in a universal
testing machine and to obtain a monotonic stress strain profile without
sudden stress spikes. The specimens were dried before testing at 120
°C for 30 min. The specimens were tested on a Zwick Z150 UTM
at a test speed of 1 mm/min. The ultimate tensile strength (UTS) was
measured by the maximum stress the specimens withstood before failure.
The strains were measured using an extensometer during the test. The
stress strain curves for epoxy/CF laminates are shown in Figure 4. These strain data
were used to calculate the elastic modulus (E) of
the specimens.

Figure 4 Stress–strain curves of epoxy/CF laminates.

The tensile strength was calculated
using the following equation:  where UTS is the ultimate tensile strength, Pmax is the maximum load, b is
the width of the sample, and h is the thickness of
the sample.

The tensile modulus was determined using the following
equation:  where E is the elastic modulus
and ε is the strain

UTS was enhanced by about 6 and 8%
with the addition of 0.5 wt
% GO and HPEEK-g-GO in epoxy/CF laminates, respectively. The values
are listed in Table 1. The improvement in tensile strength and modulus suggests that there
is formation of a strong interfacial bond between CF and epoxy, which
was also observed from the SEM micrographs. In other words, inclusion
of GO and HPEEK-g-GO in composites acted as “interconnects”,
thereby improving the stress transfer at the interface. It is well
understood that HPEEK-g-GO is well dispersed in epoxy as HPEEK improves
the interface between GO and epoxy. In the laminates, as inferred
from the SEM micrographs, HPEEK-g-GO resulted in better interfacial
adhesion of epoxy with CF. On the contrary, bare CF can be observed
in the epoxy/CF laminates. This supports the fact that HPEEK-g-GO
improves the interfacial adhesion between CF and epoxy and eventually
enhanced the ILSS properties also. By suitably modifying the surface
properties of CF, different functional groups can be harnessed, which,
when they react with the epoxy chains, can improve greatly the ILSS.
However, weak π–π interaction between GO and CF
possibly may result in “GO interconnects” at the CF
surface. This may also result in improved interfacial adhesion between
epoxy modified with HPEEK-g-GO and CF, which will be discussed in
detail in the subsequent sections (Table 2).

The improved
tensile properties in the laminates in the presence
of HPEEK-g-GO is due to the load-carrying capacity of GO in the CF/epoxy
laminates. Higher energy is required for failure of the laminates
containing GO and HPEEK-g-GO epoxy matrix compared to only neat epoxy
matrix. The load that is applied is then transferred from the epoxy
matrix to the CF through GO interconnects. When a crack propagates
under loading during failure, the nanoparticles are pulled off from
the epoxy matrix, and the energy is dissipated. This energy is due
to debonding and fracture of CF and deformation of the epoxy matrix
under loading. The failure mechanism depends on the types of fiber,
matrix, and interfaces. The dispersion of GO and HPEEK-g-GO bridges
mechanical interlocking between the CF and epoxy resin as shown in
the cartoon below based on the observed SEM micrographs. This ultimately
improves the ultimate mechanical properties.

The SEM images
of fractured epoxy laminates are shown in Figure 5a–g. It is
clear from the SEM micrographs that the CF mats are well sandwiched
between the epoxy layers (Figure 5a). From Figure 5d–g, it is clear that the interfacial adhesion between
epoxy and CF is enhanced because of HPEEK-g-GO when compared to GO.
This is manifested in the layer of the epoxy on the CF surface in
the case of HPEEK-g-GO, which also facilitated the improvement of
the mechanical properties. A cartoon shown in Figure 6 illustrates the possible interaction of
GO and HPEEK-g-GO with epoxy/CF laminates on the basis of the observations
from SEM analysis. The epoxy/CF and epoxy/GO/CF laminates failed predominantly
by pulling out of the CF, whereas in the case of epoxy/HPEEK-g-GO/CF
laminates, a thick layer of epoxy is observed to be well coated on
the surface of the CF. Taken together, the debonding between the fiber
and matrix is the dominant mechanism of failure, and the interface
is the weakest part, even though a small amount of GO sheets was introduced,
whereas, in the case of HPEEK-g-GO, because of the weak π–π
interaction between GO and CF and also because of the improved dispersion
of GO aided by HPEEK in epoxy, the interfacial adhesion between epoxy
and CF was greatly improved resulting in enhanced mechanical properties.35,36

Delamination is one of the common
and major failure modes in layered
structures. The interlaminar stresses are the source of delamination
and crack growth in composites.37 It is
imperative to understand the behavior of nanoparticles at the interface
of the layers. The interfacial adhesion should not get lower. The
lower ILSS leads to easy delamination upon loading.37 It was envisaged that the addition of nanoparticles will
improve the ILSS and, hence, was measured in the samples where the
adhesion between layers resulted in shear under specific loading conditions.38 There are various methods to determine the ILSS,
of which the better approach is by the short beam shear test (ASTM
D 2344) due to its simplicity.39 The shear
stress is independent of the support length because of the small sample
size. The test fixture consisted of a loading cylindrical roller of
6.0 mm diameter and a side support of 3.4 mm diameter. Specimens were
tested at a cross-head speed of 1 mm/min. The ILSS was determined
using the following equation:39  where ILSS is the interlaminar
shear strength, Pmax is the failure load, b is
the width of the sample, and h is the thickness of
the sample.

The ILSS results are tabulated in Table 1. It was observed that with
the addition
of nanoparticles, the ILSS of 0.5 wt % GO and 0.5 wt % HPEEK-g-GO
was enhanced from 45 MPa to 47 MPa and 50 MPa, respectively. Improvement
in the ILSS is attributed to enhanced dispersion of functionalized
GO in epoxy. These GO sheets with abundant oxygen-containing functional
groups impart polarity, hence, resulting in an interlocking effect
between the fiber and matrix and eventually enhancing the ILSS by
bridging the load between epoxy and CF.35

DMTA of Epoxy/CF Laminates
DMTA was used to evaluate
the mechanical properties of epoxy/CF laminates. The storage modulus,
loss modulus, and tan δ curves are shown in Figure 7a–c. It is observed
that for the neat epoxy CF laminate, the storage modulus was around
20.1 GPa, which was enhanced to 23.3 GPa with the addition of 0.5
wt % GO in the epoxy matrix. Further, the storage modulus has improved
to 25.4 GPa with the addition of 0.5 wt % of HPEEK-g-GO in the epoxy
matrix. The same trend was observed in the epoxy composites with the
addition of 0.5 wt % GO and HPEEK-g-GO without addition of CF in our
previous study. The enhancement in storage modulus suggests effective
load transfer from epoxy to the filler, which is attributed to the
reinforcing action by GO sheets and HPEEK-g-GO. The latter enhances
the interfacial bonding between GO sheets and epoxy resin through
HPEEK grafting.13,40Figure 7c shows the rubbery to glassy transition
in epoxy CF laminates using the tan δ curves. The Tg is observed to be around 185 °C for neat epoxy,
which decreases slightly to 182 °C with the addition of 0.5 wt
% GO, whereas it increases to 192 °C with the addition of 0.5
wt % HPEEK-g-GO. These results exhibit the same trend as shown by
MDSC in the previous section.

Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) Shielding
The EMI
shielding effectiveness of various epoxy laminates was measured in
the frequency range of 12 to 18 GHz and is shown in Figure 8. The total shielding effectiveness
(SET) can be estimated using scattering parameters obtained
by VNA and is expressed as41  where S12 and S21 are the reverse and
forward transmission coefficients, respectively. There are two mechanisms,
namely, reflection and absorption, responsible for EMI shielding.
Reflection is enhanced by connectivity and conductivity of the shielding
material. It is envisaged that CF can act as a waveguide and attenuate
the incoming EM radiation.42 The laminate
containing only CF displayed around −50dB shielding effectiveness.
The continuous CFs, which are present in the epoxy matrix, play an
important role, which transports electrical charge over large distances
without electrical losses.43 Interestingly,
it was observed that the modified laminates with 0.5 wt % GO and 0.5
wt % HPEEK-g-GO also showed similar shielding effectiveness as compared
to the epoxy neat CF laminate. This suggests that although insulators
like HPEEK covers the GO sheets, the charge transfer through the CF
mat is largely unaltered, although accumulation of charge at the interface
may result in lossy interfaces.44,45 The mechanism behind
the total shielding effectiveness for epoxy laminates is shown in Figure 9. This result suggests
that multifunctional properties can be achieved in epoxy/CF laminates
using HPEEK-g-GO.

epoxy laminates.

Conclusions
In
this study, a unique strategy was adopted wherein HPEEK was
grafted onto GO sheets through esterification. As observed from TEM
analysis, HPEEK-g-GO disperses well in the composites even after curing.
Besides good dispersion, the observed 8% improvement in tensile strength,
10% increase in Young’s modulus and 26% enhancement in storage
modulus of the epoxy/CF laminates are attributed to the good interfacial
bonding between HPEEK-g-GO and epoxy. This was further supported by
the fact that a layer of epoxy modified with HPEEK-g-GO was observed
on the CF surface as compared to bare CF in epoxy/CF laminates. The
addition of HPEEK-g-GO also led to enhanced glass transition temperature
in the laminates. In addition, the flame-retardant properties were
also enhanced in the presence of GO and HPEEK-g-GO, and the EMI shielding
properties were retained, although an insulating layer of HPEEK is
present on the GO surface. Taken together, the present work demonstrates
that by grafting HPEEK onto GO sheets, the interfacial adhesion and
the dispersion of GO sheets in epoxy can be improved, which eventually
results in enhanced mechanical and thermal properties in the laminates
even with small fractions of HPEEK-g-GO.

Experimental
Materials
Epoxy resin (EPOLAM 2063) and an anhydride-based
hardener were obtained from Axson Technologies (France). The bidirectional
CF mat was supplied by Hindoostan Technical Fabrics. Poly(ether ether
ketone) was provided by Vestakeep, Germany. Graphite flakes and the
reagents used in this study were procured from Sigma. The solvents
were obtained from commercial sources and were used without any pretreatment.

Fabrication of Carbon/Epoxy Composites
The carbon/epoxy
composite laminate was prepared using vacuum enhanced resin infusion
technology (VERITy), a CSIR-NAL proprietary process.46 In this process, the reinforcement is held in a tool cavity
and is infused with resin under a differential pressure to completely
wet the fiber bundle. A toughened glass plate was used as a tool for
fabrication of the laminate. The glass plate was used to capture the
behavior of resin flow during infusion. Eight layers of carbon fabric
(300 mm × 300 mm) were cut. The edges of the layer were trimmed,
aligning warp and weft fibers. The glass plate was cleaned for any
dust, and a release film was placed on the plate. A release fabric
(peel ply) was placed over the release film. The carbon layers were
placed above each other, aligning the warp fiber as reference. The
layup sequence followed was 0/908. A release fabric was
then placed on top, and then a porous release film was placed on top
of the release fabric. The release fabric was used to get a rough
texture on the surface, which would facilitate the tab bonding on
the specimens for testing. Finally, a highly permeable resin distribution
medium was placed on top, and the edges were sealed to avoid resin
race tracking. The setup was vacuum-bagged keeping the resin feed
line on one side and the vacuum on the opposite side. Full vacuum
was ensured by sealing the vacuum bag completely. Simultaneously,
the GO or HPEEK-g-GO was dispersed in ethanol, followed by sonication
for 30 min. The EPOLAM 2063 epoxy resin was added to the mixture,
and bath sonication was done for 30 min. To evaporate the solvent
from the mixture, it was kept in a vacuum oven for 24 h. The resultant
mixture was mechanically stirred at 400 rpm, followed by the addition
of the hardener (in 100:107 weight ratio), followed by 15 min of mechanical
mixing at 500 rpm. This resin mixture was then heated to 45 °C
and degassed for 20 min. As prepared, the VERITy setup was heated
in the oven for 30 min at 50 °C. Resin heating and glass plate
heating was carried out to keep the resin viscosity low during infusion,
ensuring the complete wetting of the fiber tows. The viscosity of
the resin mixture at 45 °C is 250 cP. The resin mixture was then
infused at 45 °C under a differential pressure, and the infused
laminate was cured at 80 °C for 7 h. The weight ratio (60/40)
of the CF and epoxy resin mixture was maintained during the laminate
fabrication. Post-curing was carried after demolding of the laminate
under free-standing conditions, that is, without vacuum and pressure
at 180 °C for 4 h. The specimens were cut using a specially made
composite specimen-cutting machine.
