A photonic crystal film (PCF) which consists of a porous
layered
structure with a highly ordered periodic arrangement of nanopores
has been used to differentiate between various mixtures of water and
ethanol (EtOH). The refractive index difference between the wall (silica)
of the empty nanopore and air which occupies it results in the structural
color of the PCF. This color disappears when the nanopores are infiltrated
by a liquid with a similar refractive index to silica (or silicon
dioxide). The disappearance of the structural color provides a means
to construct a colorimetric sensor to differentiate between various
water/EtOH mixtures based on their wettability of the nanopores in
the PCF. In this study, an array of silica-based PCFs was synthesized
on a silicon substrate with a precise control of nanopore properties
using the co-assembly/sedimentation method. Using this method, we
benefitted from having different PCFs on a single substrate. Chemical
coatings, neck angles, and film thicknesses on each PCF were
the three factors used to adjust the wettability of the pores. Nanopore
wetting by water/EtOH mixtures was studied in a systematic manner
based on the three factors, and the findings were used to develop
a sensor for visual differentiation of various water/EtOH mixtures.
The final developed sensor consisting of an array of six PCFs was
able to differentiate between seven different water/EtOH mixtures:
W10, W20, W30, W40, W50, W60, and W70, in which W10 means 10% of water
in EtOH.

1 Introduction
Photonic crystals (PCs)
are periodic nanostructured materials which
can control how photons are absorbed by or reflected from them. Color
displays, inks and paints, optical switches, lasers, filters, solar
cells, and sensors are applications in which PCs have been used.1−6 PCs with different compositions have been developed to be used as
chemical sensors for sensing pH, solvents, and so on.7−11

Photonic crystal films (PCFs) possess structural color which
originates
from the refractive index difference between the matrix material (in
which nanopores are formed) and air (which occupies the empty nanopores).12−16 For PCFs to be used as chemical sensors, the surface of the
nanosized pores inside the PCFs is typically coated by hydrophobic/oleophilic
materials such as fluoroalkylchlorosilanes.7,17 These
coating materials will cause the pores to be wetted or not wetted
by certain liquids (Figure 1). When dry, the PCF is shown with its structural color
(Figure 1A). When
a liquid with a similar refractive index to the matrix (i.e., silica)
wets the nanopores, the structural color disappears because of the
refractive index matching between the liquid and matrix (Figure 1B).

PCF due to color disappearance caused by nanopore-wetting
behavior; (A) nonwetted PCF, (B) wetted PCF.

The disappearance of the structural color provides
a way to differentiate
between various liquids with different compositions based on the wettability
of the nanopores.

Silica-based PCFs with a chemically functionalized
nanopore surface
offer a selective wettability threshold to differentiate between liquids
of different chemical compositions. There are two main approaches
for liquid identification using PCFs: (1) based on color change of
PCF due to the infiltration of a liquid with a different refractive
index compared to air; (2) based on color disappearance, in which
colored (nonwetted) and dark (wetted) regions are observed. In the
first approach, color changes may be small and angle-dependent, and
this is complicated for nontrained persons to discern. On the other
hand, the second approach is easier to use as compared to the first
approach.18

Aizenberg and her research
team have developed PC sensors with
patterned chemical coatings on surfaces throughout their 3D porous
structures. Patterning chemical functionalities in different regions
on the sensor was achieved using oxygen plasma with removable masks.
Using these sensors, they were successful to differentiate between
three pure liquids, such as isopropanol, acetone, and water. Various
pure alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol), different
pure alkanes (hexane, heptane, octane, nonane, and decane), and different
auto fuels (gasoline and diesel) have also been differentiated.19 They were also able to differentiate between
different compositions of a two-component mixture, that is, water/EtOH
mixtures of W50, W22 (W22 is a mixture of 22% water and 78% EtOH),
W15, and W0.20 In another work, they were
able to differentiate between water/EtOH mixtures of W10, W15, W20,
W25, and W50.21 The selectivity of their
sensors has shown a remarkable improvement in another report. By applying
new chemical gradients on their well-ordered PCs, they have been able
to differentiate between water/EtOH mixtures of W7.5, W5, W2.5, and
W0 which have very small differences in surface tension. Among these
cases, they are not able to differentiate between water/EtOH mixtures
with the ethanol content lower than 50%. By replacing conventional
alkylchlorosilanes by a co-polymer based on a hydrophilic electrolyte
monomer (acrylic acid) and a hydrophobic chromophore and applying
different exposure times of ultraviolet light for photopolymerization,
they could modify the wettability of the pores of the sensor and differentiate
between water/EtOH mixtures of W100, W97.5, W95, W92.5, W90, and W87.5
but not with the ethanol content higher than 12.5%.22 In these reports of differentiating between water/EtOH
mixtures, they did not manage to differentiate mixtures that have
EtOH contents less than 50% (e.g. W60), possibly because of the inability
to find a suitable hydrophilic chemical coating.

Various groups
have previously developed sensor strips for differentiation
of hydrocarbon mixtures with close chemical compositions.23,24,28,29 The wettability threshold for each sensor was tuned using a combination
of different chemical coatings and neck angles. In this way, gasoline/EtOH
mixtures of E10 (10% EtOH in gasoline), E5 (5% EtOH in gasoline),
and pure gasoline have been differentiated by the sensor.23 The developed sensors have also been shown to
be capable of differentiation of gasoline/oil mixtures with gasoline-to-oil
ratios of 16:1, 20:1, 25:1, 32:1, 40:1, and 50:1 which are typical
fuel/lubricant mixtures used in two-stroke engines.23,24

Many methods reported to fabricate PCF have the inflexibility
of
building only one PCF on a substrate at a time. Therefore, different
PCFs cannot be easily achieved on one single test strip. To overcome
this inflexibility, the PCFs will have to be diced into square pieces
and assembled on a separate solid support to create a test strip,
and this complicates the scale-up process in manufacturing. In this
study, we have achieved the following objectives: (1) using evaporative
sedimentation method to synthesize PCFs which brings about the advantage
that we can have an array of several PCFs on a single substrate; (2)
performing parallel liquid mixture analysis on several PCFs on the
strip in order to multiplex the analysis of different liquid mixtures.

The reported method offers several advantages as follows: (1) this
way of constructing an array of PCFs on the same substrate will be
less costly and more efficient as compared with other methods because
this will not require subsequent dicing and assembling of different
PCFs on a support. (2) As compared with many other reported methods,
the fabrication process of PCFs using this technique takes shorter
time; from the manufacturing standpoint, this aspect makes our method
economically more efficient.

The final sensor strip that consisted
of an array of six PCFs was
designed and fabricated by using an optimized combination of the neck
angle, film thickness, and surface chemical coating. The sensor strip
has been shown to have the capability to differentiate between seven
different liquid mixtures with a simple-to-read wetted/nonwetted platform.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
Circular silicon wafers
(4-inch diameter) were provided by UniversityWafer, Inc. (Boston,
MA, USA). Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) nanospheres (1% solid content)
with a diameter of 318 ± 12 nm were purchased from Phosphorex,
Inc. (Hopkinton, MA, USA). The PMMA nanospheres were suspended in
deionized (DI) water. Tetraethyl orthosilicate (>99.0%) was obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich (Oakville, ON, Canada). Trichloro(3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)-silane
(3FS) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Oakville, ON, Canada); nonafluorohexyltrichlorosilane
(9FS) was provided by Gelest, Inc. (Morrisville, PA, USA); trichloromethylsilane
(99%) (TMS) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Oakville, ON, Canada);
3-(trichlorosilyl)propyl methacrylate (TPMA) was obtained from Fluka
(Buchs, Switzerland). Dimethyldichlorosilane solution (2% w/v) in
octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (or Repel-silane) was purchased from
GE Healthcare (Uppsala, Sweden).

2.2 PDMS and Silicon Preparation
The
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mold with six trenches was designed and
fabricated to construct an array of PCFs on a silicon substrate. Six
trenches, with dimensions of 2.5 mm width–20 mm length–1
mm depth, were cut on the PDMS slab (1 mm thickness) using a knife
blade. Circular silicon wafers (4 in. diameter) were cut by a diamond
glass cutter into two equal pieces, making two semicircles. After
the semicircular silicon substrate was cleaned using Sparkleen detergent
[Sparkleen powder (10% w/v) dissolved in DI water] followed by rinsing
with DI water, the substrate was sealed to the PDMS mold. Then, the
substrate was placed in a Pyrex dish containing 100 mL of piranha
solution [sulfuric acid (98%) and hydrogen peroxide (30%) mixed in
a 7:3 ratio] for 1 h to create a hydrophilic surface on the substrate.
It was then removed from the dish and rinsed with water, ethanol (95%),
and water successively and blow-dried.

2.3 PMMA/TEOS Mixture Preparation
A mixture
of 0.01 M HCl, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), and anhydrous ethanol
(EtOH) was prepared in a glass vial (a ratio of 1:1:1.5 w/w/w HCl/TEOS/EtOH)
and used as the matrix solution. This solution was mixed thoroughly
using a magnetic stirrer at 200 rpm for 1 h. PMMA nanospheres, which
were suspended in water, were used as the template. The PMMA stock
bottle was sonicated for 30 min to homogenize the colloids before
use. Aliquots of PMMA colloids and the matrix solution were added
to a definite amount of DI water to form the PMMA/TEOS mixture in
a tube. The mixtures were then capped and sonicated for 1 h.

2.4 PCF Fabrication
In order to synthesize
an array of silica-based PCFs, the PDMS mold consisting of six trenches
was sealed on the silicon substrate (Figure 2A). The PMMA/TEOS mixture was then introduced
into the trenches. This mold allows separate deposition of six different
PMMA/TEOS mixtures on one silicon substrate without any liquid leakage.
After deposition of the PMMA/TEOS mixtures, the mold substrate was
placed in a covered plastic Petri dish in which the humidity was kept
high (using wet tissues) to reduce solvent evaporation. All mold substrate
samples were left in the plastic dish for 10–12 h to make sure
the sedimentation of all PMMA nanospheres was completed. After this,
the cover was removed from the Petri dish to start solvent evaporation.
After 8–12 h, the mold was removed, leaving the white-colored
film deposited on the surface of the silicon substrate (Figure 2B), and then, it was placed
in a programmable oven for calcination. The oven temperature was ramped
up to 500 °C over 4 h, held at that temperature for 2 h, and
ramped down to room temperature over 1 h. This calcination process
caused thermal decomposition of the template (PMMA nanospheres) and
conversion of the TEOS matrix to silica (SiO2), forming
the silica-based PCF on the silicon substrate. An array of several
PCFs formed on the same substrate (Figure 2C) was imaged by a smartphone camera at a
viewing angle of 55°.

2.5 Surface Modification
In order to
tune the chemical property of the surface of pores, the PCFs were
placed in a vacuum desiccator, exposing the nanopores in them to chemical
vapors of silane. 3FS, 9FS, methyltrichlorosilane (99%) (TMS), and
3-(trichlorosilyl)propyl methacrylate (TPMA) were the silanes used
in this study. For this purpose, two small vials each containing 90
μL of a silane solution were placed into the desiccator. A vacuum
suction was applied to the desiccator for 3–5 min, and the
PCFs were left exposed to the chemical vapors inside the desiccator
for 24 h. After chemical vapor deposition, the PCFs were baked at
150 °C for 20 min. The abovementioned procedure was also used
for coating silanes on flat silicon substrates to measure contact
angles of various liquid mixtures on different surface silane coatings.

2.6 Contact Angle Measurements
In order
to quantify the wettability of various liquid mixtures on solid surfaces
with different chemical coatings, contact angle measurements were
performed using a contact angle goniometer (OCA 15) manufactured by
DataPhysics Corp (San Jose, CA, USA). Using a micropipette, a small
droplet of liquid (10 μL) was placed on the flat coated silicon
substrate and the angle between the solid–liquid interface
and liquid–vapor interface was measured.25

2.7 SEM Measurements
In order to prevent
charge build-up26 on scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) samples, they were sputter-coated with a thin layer
of conductive iridium using a Carbon & Iridium Coating System
(EM ACE600) by Leica (Wetzlar, Germany). Sputtering was performed
at high vacuum (10–5 Torr) for about 1 min to attain
a layer of iridium with a thickness of 10 nm. After sample preparation,
SEM measurements were carried out using the Nova NanoSEM 430 system
(FEI,Hillsboro, Oregon, USA) at a voltage of 15 kV. The working distance
was set at 5 ± 1 mm for all of the samples. Except cross-sectional
images which were taken without any tilt (0°), many of the SEM
images in this work were taken with a tilt angle of 40°.

2.8 Optical Imaging
Optical images were
taken using a 12 MP smartphone camera (iPhone X, Apple, Inc, Cupertino,
CA, USA). Optical images of PCFs were taken at an incidence angle
of ∼55°.

2.9 Wetting Tests
After fabrication of
the PCF samples, they were checked by the water wetting tests to verify
that the pores of the PCFs are well ordered without any blockings.
To pass the test, the blue structural color of the PCFs should disappear
upon water immersion due to liquid penetration into the pores, and
the color of the PCF should reappear after blow-drying the sample
with compressed air. The samples were then coated with silane and
wetting tests were performed. The wetting tests of water/EtOH mixtures
were started with W5 and continued to W100 (pure water) with an increment
of 5% water. In order to be consistent in wetting time, each sample
was left immersed in water/EtOH mixtures for 10 s. The samples were
blow-dried by compressed air after each wetting test in order to speed
up the color recovery (or pore liquid evaporation) needed for subsequent
wetting tests.

In order to investigate the effect of only chemical
coating (but not PCF structural factors) on the wetting behavior of
PCFs, one single PCF sample was used. One PCF sample was first coated
with a specific coating, followed by performing all the wetting tests
on it, and then, the coating was thermally removed. This was achieved
by placing the PCF sample in a programmable oven, with the temperature
ramped up to 800 °C over 8 h, held at 800 °C for 1 h, and
ramped down to room temperature over 3 h. In order to confirm complete
removal of the coating, the sample should pass the water wetting test;
the removal of the coating was verified by the disappearance of the
blue structural color of the PCF upon its immersion in water.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Interfacial Properties of Water/EtOH Mixtures
The interfacial properties of various water/EtOH mixtures on four
different silane coatings were investigated. These silanes are 3FS,
9FS, TMS, and TPMA.

Figure 3 shows the contact angles of various water/EtOH mixtures
measured on flat silicon substrates that were coated with TPMA, TMS,
3FS, and 9FS. The water/EtOH mixtures are designated by the percentage
of water in the mixtures, shown by the number after the letter “W”,
for example, W60 is the mixture of 60% water and 40% EtOH. The six
mixtures are W100, W80, W60, W40, W20, and W5. Based on Figure 3, as the water contents of
these mixtures decrease, the contact angles decrease because water
has a higher surface tension (72.01 mN/m at 25 °C) as compared
to EtOH (21.82 mN/m at 25 °C).

Figure 3 Measured contact angles from six different
water/EtOH mixtures
on the silicon substrate when coated with; 9FS, 3FS, TMS, and TPMA.

In addition, the value of the contact angle for
a specific water/EtOH
mixture on silicon coated with 9FS is higher than that with 3FS. This
indicates 9FS is more hydrophobic than 3FS, possibly because of a
strong force within 9FS and hence low interaction between 9FS and
the liquid. On the other hand, TPMA produces the lowest contact angle,
showing it to be a more polar molecule as a result of the presence
of two carbon–oxygen bonds in its molecular structure as compared
with TMS. The contact angle values of water/EtOH mixtures obtained
on TMS and 3FS are in a good agreement with an earlier reported work.20

3.2 Effect of the Neck Angle on Wetting Behavior
of PCFs
In this section, the effect of only the neck angle
on the wetting behavior of PCFs was studied, and so, we fixed the
coating (i.e., 9FS) and the number of film layers (the amounts of
PMMA and water used were 20 and 430 μL, respectively, to achieve
PCFs with four layers; the determination of the number of layer was
shown in the Supporting Information). To
adjust the neck angle, the amount of TEOS in the PMMA/TEOS mixture
used for each PCF was increased, that is, from 1.1 μL in PCF
1 (on the left on Figure 4) to 3 μL in PCF 6 (on the right). Based on Figure 4, increasing the
amount of TEOS results in a decrease in the neck angle from 32°
± 2° to 20° ± 2°. When the PCF sample was
immersed in W25, the six PCFs remained nonwetted because the contact
angle of W25 (θC = 34° ± 1°) is greater
than neck angles (φ0) of all PCFs (θC > φ0 is required for wetting). When the sample
was immersed in W10, all PCFs were wetted because the contact angle
of W10 (θC = 19° ± 1°) is smaller
than the neck angles of the PCFs. By changing the amount of TEOS,
it is possible to control the values of neck angles in the PCFs and
hence the wettability of the PCFs.

Figure 4 Effect of the neck angle on the wettability
of PCFs. In the image
of the silicon strip, PCFs 1–6 are arranged from left to right.
The various TEOS amounts in the PMMA/TEOS mixtures are shown; in all
cases, the amounts of PMMA and water used were fixed to be 20 and
430 μL, respectively. These PCFs were coated with 9FS.

3.3 Effect of Chemical Coatings on Wetting Behavior
of PCFs
In this section, the effect of only chemical coating
on the wetting behavior of PCFs is investigated, and so, all six PCFs
have the same composition and film thickness. Figure 5 represents the effect of chemical coatings
(i.e., TPMA, TMS, 3FS, and 9FS) on the wetting behavior of an array
of PCFs, with the uncoated PCFs as the control. The TPMA-coated sample
remained nonwetted when it was immersed in W80 and W85, but it was
wetted when immersed in W75 or in mixtures of higher EtOH contents.
The higher the water content in the water/EtOH mixtures is, the higher
is the contact angle of the mixtures, and it is more difficult for
them to wet the PCFs. We define the boundary of wetting and nonwetting
as the wetting threshold, that is, for a TPMA-coated sample, the wetting
threshold is between W75 and W80 (i.e., W75–W80).

Figure 5 Effect of chemical
coatings on the wetting behavior of an array
of PCFs coated with TPMA, TMS, 3FS, and 9FS. All six PCFs have the
same composition and thickness by using the same amounts of PMMA,
TEOS, and water in the template/matrix mixture, that is, 24, 1.7,
and 700 μL, respectively, to achieve PCFs with three layers.

As a result of high hydrophobicity of the TMS-coated
PCFs, the
wetting threshold was shifted to mixtures with lower EtOH contents,
that is, (W60–W65). When the samples were coated with 3FS and
9FS with greater hydrophobicities, the wetting thresholds were further
shifted to W40–W45 and W15–W20, respectively. Therefore,
by using different chemical coatings, the wettability of the PCFs
can be tuned as indicated by the wetting thresholds.

3.4 Effect of Film Thickness on Wetting Behavior
of PCFs
In this section, the effect of PCF thickness (in
terms of number of layers) on wetting behavior of PCFs is investigated;
see Figure 6. Two PCFs
were fabricated using PMMA, TEOS, and water amounts of 45, 2.8, and
1300 μL (for three layers) and 50, 3.1, and 510 μL (for
eight layers), respectively; the determination of number of layers
was shown in the Supporting Information. Because the TEOS/PMMA ratio for both samples was fixed to 0.062,
we expect the PCFs should have the same neck angle and have the same
wetting threshold for the same coating (i.e., 9FS). However, while
the three-layer sample was wetted in W15, the eight-layer sample was
not wetted in W15. Therefore, the film thickness is another factor
that can be used to tune the wettability of PCFs.

Figure 6 Effect of thickness on
wetting behavior of PCFs with three and
eight layers. All six PCFs in each silicon strip have the same neck
angle; see the text for details; these PCFs were coated with 9FS.

3.5 Combinations of the Neck Angle, Film Thickness,
and Chemical Coating to Tune Wettability
In this section,
the neck angle, thickness, and chemical coating are combined to tune
wettability of PCFs for differentiation of various water/EtOH mixtures.

To understand the combination of the three factors in a systematic
way, we perform wetting tests, determine the wetting thresholds, and
then plot these in terms of film thickness (number of layers) and
neck angle. To represent the neck angle, we defined a parameter called
the excess ratio over the theoretically required amount of TEOS (EXR);
this is a quantity that can be calculated based on the actual amount
of TEOS used in the PMMA/TEOS mixture to fabricate a PCF. For example,
for a PCF with the amount of PMMA, TEOS, and water of 45, 2.8, and
1300 μL, respectively, the theoretical amount of TEOS to fill
26% of the volume of the PCF is 1.4 μL. However, the actual
amount of TEOS used to fabricate the PCF was 2.8 μL. Then, by
dividing 2.8 μL (actual amount used) over 1.4 μL (theoretical
amount needed), the EXR is calculated to be 2. We believe the greater
is the value of EXR, the thicker are the walls of the PCF, and the
lower is the value of the neck angle, the lower is the tendency of
pore wetting. We used the theoretical matrix volume of 26% (or pore
volume of 74%) as a reference point to calculate EXR values for all
the samples without loss of generality, even though we know the theoretical
values based on 2, 3, and 5 layers have been computed to be 32, 30,
and 28%, respectively.27 Table S1 in Supporting Information shows the details for
the compositions of the five PCF samples with different thicknesses
and EXR values that are fabricated.

Figure 7 shows the
wetting results of TPMA-coated samples after being immersed in various
water/EtOH mixtures. In each PCF sample, the value of EXR increases
from PCF 1 to PCF 6 (left to right). The different numbers of layers
add another quantifier to these PCFs, that is, (A) two layers, (B)
three layers, (C) four layers, (D) six layers, and (E) eight layers.
For instance, for PCFs with six layers, they are called PCFs D1-6,
and for eight layers, they are called PCFs E1-6. In the case of eight
layers, W65 wetted PCF E1 but not E2-6, but W60 wetted all PCFs E1-6.
In the case of six layers, W65 wetted PCFs D1-4 but not D5-6, but
W60 wetted all PCFs D1-6. Therefore, in order to differentiate between
W60 and W70, TPMA-coated samples with six or eight layers can be used.

Figure 7 Effect
of thickness on the wettability of PCFs when coated with
TPMA. Each column represents wetting results of six PCFs with different
numbers of film layers: (A) two layers, (B) three layers, (C) four
layers, (D) six layers, and (E) eight layers. Within each column,
the six PCFs are designated as 1–6 from left to right.

The wetting results of TMS-coated, 3FS-coated,
and 9FS-coated PCF
samples after being immersed in various water/EtOH mixtures are shown
in Figures S3, S4, and S5, respectively,
as shown in the Supporting Information.
Based on Figure S3, in order to differentiate
between W60 and W50, TMS-coated samples with 3, 4, and 6 layers can
be used. Also, to differentiate between W50 and W40, TMS-coated samples
with eight layers can be used. Based on Figure S4, in order to differentiate between W40 and W30, 3FS-coated
samples with three, four, and six layers can be used. Based on Figure S5, in order to differentiate between
W25 and W20, 9FS-coated samples with two layers can be used. Also,
to differentiate between W20 and W10, 9FS-coated samples with four,
six, and eight layers can be used.

The wetting threshold based
on EXR and number of layers for the
mixtures of W75, W70, and W65 can be obtained from Figure 7. Based on Figure 7, when a two-layer (A) TPMA-coated
PCF is used, W75 wetted PCF A1-2 but not PCF A3-6. From Table S1, EXR for A2 and A3 are 3.3 and 4, respectively,
and so, the wetting threshold can be obtained by calculating the average
EXR value, which resulted in 3.7. Similarly, when a three-layer (B)
TPMA-coated PCF was used, W75 wetted PCF B1 but not PCF B2-6; the
wetting threshold was given by the average of EXR values for PCF B1
(2) and for PCF B2 (2.7), which resulted in 2.4. These two wetting
thresholds for W75, that is, (EXR = 3.7, layer number = 2) and (EXR
= 2.4, layer number = 3), were then plotted in Figure 8, and the two data points were joined to
give the wetting threshold line in blue on the far left. The same
procedure was followed to find other average EXR values and number
of layers for the wetting thresholds of two other mixtures, that is,
W70 and W65, and the wetting threshold lines were plotted in orange
and gray on the middle and far right, respectively. The obtained plot,
as shown in Figure 8, shows the three wetting threshold lines, in which the wetted regions
are on the left sides of the lines, designated with green points,
whereas nonwetted regions are on the right sides of the lines. The
wetting thresholds for PCFs coated with TMS, 3FS, and 9FS using different
liquid mixtures are also extracted and plotted in Figures S6, S7, and S8, respectively.

PCFs for three water/ETOH mixtures: W75 (blue), W70 (orange), and

3.6 Development of a Sensor to Differentiate Water/EtOH
Mixtures
Based on the wetting threshold graphs obtained in Section 3.5, a sensor strip
platform was designed in order to differentiate between various water/EtOH
mixtures. As it is shown in Figure 9, six different PCFs were produced with different chemical
coatings, EXR, and film thicknesses. In order to differentiate between
W70 and W60, an eight-layer PCF was fabricated with an EXR of 1.6
and with TPMA as chemical coating, see the red dot in Figure 8. To differentiate between
W60 and W50, a three-layer PCF was fabricated with an EXR of 3.6 and
coating of TMS, and to differentiate between W50 and W40, an eight-layer
PCF was fabricated with an EXR of 2.1 which was coated with TMS; see
the two red dots in Figure S6. In order
to differentiate between W40 and W30, a six-layer PCF was fabricated
with an EXR of 1.6 which was coated with 3FS; see the red dot in Figure S7. To differentiate between W30 and W20,
a two-layer PCF was made with an EXR and chemical coating of 3 and
9FS, respectively, and between W20 and W10, a six-layer PCF was produced
and coated with 9FS and the EXR was designed to be 1.8; see the two
red dots in Figure S8. The schematic diagram
of the ideal sensor using the PCF design is shown in Figure 9, in which the liquid differentiation
can be achieved by counting the number of wetted/nonwetted PCFs on
the sensor strip.

Figure 9 Schematic sensor design and composition details of six
PCFs to
differentiate between seven different water/EtOH mixtures: W10, W20,
W30, W40, W50, W60, and W70.

Figure 10 shows
the image of the fabricated sensor and wetting results in seven water/EtOH
mixtures: W10, W20, W30, W40, W50, W60, and W70. Based on Figure 10, the differentiation
of these water/EtOH mixtures have been accomplished successfully.
The final sensor strip shows six wetted PCFs when immersed in W10
(or a mixture with higher EtOH contents). If only one, but not two,
PCF is not wetted after immersion in a water/EtOH mixture, the mixture
is considered to be W20. The final sensor shows 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6
nonwetted PCFs when immersed in W30, W40, W50, W60, and W70 (or a
mixture with lower EtOH contents), respectively.

substrate.

The present work is compared with previous reports,
as shown in Table 1 Here, the PCF preparation
time, chemical coating, liquid mixtures for differentiation, and differentiation
methods in previous reports and the present work are summarized. In
this study, the PCF preparation time of 17 h was achieved which is
lower than the previously reported times (55 h). The final sensor
in the present study can be used to differentiate between a wider
range of water/ethanol mixtures (W10 to W70) as compared to the previous
work. Moreover, the differentiation method in the present study is
based on counting the number of wetted/nonwetted PCFs, which is more
easily interpreted than the method of considering color pattern changes
found in some of the previous reports.

4 Conclusions
In this study, an array
of six PCFs was fabricated on a single
silicon substrate using co-assembly sedimentation. The effects of
chemical coating, neck angle, and film thickness on the PCF wettability
were studied systematically. A more hydrophobic chemical coating,
a smaller neck angle, and a larger film thickness result in more difficult
wetting of PCF pores. Combinations of these three factors were used
to tune the wettability of the PCFs for various water/EtOH mixtures
with 5% EtOH difference. Based on the optimized combinations of the
three factors, a final sensor strip platform was designed to differentiate
between seven water/EtOH mixtures. The final developed sensor allows
us to differentiate between seven water/EtOH mixtures: W10, W20, W30,
W40, W50, W60, and W70 by counting the number of wetted and nonwetted
PCFs. The results of six, five, four, three, two, one, and zero wetted
PCFs after immersion in a water/EtOH mixtures can be attributed to
the presence of W10 (or a mixture with a higher EtOH content), W20,
W30, W40, W50, W60, and W70 (or a mixture with a lower EtOH content).
