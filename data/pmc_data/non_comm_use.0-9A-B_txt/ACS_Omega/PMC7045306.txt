Clathrate
hydrates are ice-like compounds consisting of small gas
molecules enclosed in water molecule cages. The formation of gas hydrate
in oil and gas pipelines may result in flow assurance failure and
serious safety and environmental concerns. Antiagglomeration is a
promising method to mitigate gas hydrate risks in hydrocarbon flowlines.
Morphological behavior of hydrates in the presence of antiagglomerants
can provide important information on the antiagglomeration mechanisms.
This study reports the visual observations of the morphology of hydrate
formed with a water droplet immersed in cyclopentane with and without
the presence of a hydrate antiagglomerant (AA). The effect of AA on
the hydrate crystal growth was investigated. The AA exhibited a kinetic
inhibition effect. With no AA, a faceted hydrate shell formed around
the water droplet was observed. The subcooling can affect the rate
of lateral growth. Higher subcooling facilitates hydrate growth. With
the presence of 0.04 wt % AA, a hairy and porous morphology of hydrate
was observed. At higher AA concentrations, a vertical type of growth
after the lateral growth of the hydrate shell was observed. This is
probably the first report of vertical growth of cyclopentane hydrate
formed with a water droplet. A hypothesis is proposed to explain the
vertical growth mechanism of the hydrate crystals.

Introduction
Clathrate hydrates are crystalline, ice-like
compounds composed
of small gas molecules enclosed in hydrogen-bonded water cages. The
formation of gas hydrate in hydrocarbon flowlines often causes flow
assurance failure, serious safety risks, and environmental concerns.1 Hydrate antiagglomeration by hydrate antiagglomerants
(AAs) is a promising solution to mitigate gas hydrate risks in oil
and gas pipelines.2 AAs affect the hydrate
surface properties and prevent the aggregation of the small hydrate
crystals into large, flowline-blocking masses and ensure that hydrate
crystals are dispersed in the production stream.3 The AAs can exhibit higher performance at high subcooling
conditions (e.g., >10 °C) than kinetic hydrate inhibitors.4 The main limitation associated with AA is that
they are infective at high water cut conditions (e.g., >50%).3 New AAs that can be active at high water cut
conditions remain to be developed.

In recent years, a novel
AA proposed by Sun and Firoozabadi,5 where
the effective component is cocamidopropyl
dimethylamine, was confirmed to be effective at water cut up to 100%
with respect to the liquid phase (with water to hydrate conversion
less than 30 at 100% water cut).5−7 The high performance of this AA
at high water cut conditions even in the bulk water phase is considered
to be attributed to the strong binding force between the AA molecule
and hydrate surface. Based on the investigations conducted by the
research groups of Firoozabadi5−9 and Chen et al.,10 AA was confirmed to
be effective in hydrocarbon/gas (methane or natural gas)/aqueous mixtures
at high pressures up to 10 MPa and water contents up to 100% (with
respect to the liquid phase). However, emulsions stabilized by AA
were observed to be not stable. An emulsion (water-in-oil) with high
stability produced by AA can facilitate the hydrate antiagglomeration
by predispersing the continuous water phase into suspended water droplets
in the oil phase. The low stability of the emulsion produced by AA
may demonstrate the low density of adsorbed AA molecules at the water–hydrocarbon
interface.11 As described above, the AA’s
performance in a sapphire rocking cell setup at high pressure conditions
has been extensively rated. However, the rocking cell test is considered
to be time-consuming and may not provide all the detailed results
that we need to understand the performance of AA. The effect of AA
on hydrate formation at the water–oil interface, which plays
a critical role in hydrate antiagglomeration, remains to be further
investigated. Additionally, it was demonstrated that the visual observations
of the morphological behavior of hydrates in the presence of antiagglomerants
can provide important information on the antiagglomeration mechanisms.12 The morphology of gas hydrate crystals can be
significantly changed by AAs.12 The formation
of hydrate is considered to be an interfacial phenomenon and occurs
at the interface between water and the hydrate former phase. A three-step
mechanism (nucleation, lateral growth, and radial growth) has been
proposed for the hydrate formation and verified by many researchers.13−20 These considerations motivated us to obtain further insight into
the working mechanisms of AA by conducting visual observations of
the nucleation and growth of hydrate crystals on the surface of a
water droplet exposed to the oil phase with and without the presence
of AA.

In this study, cyclopentane is employed as the hydrate
former as
it is immiscible in the water at atmospheric pressure and forms structure
II hydrate (the same hydrate structure as that encountered in flowlines).
A self-hydrate-visualization cell apparatus is used to study the influence
of AA on the morphology of cyclopentane hydrate. The growth mechanism
of cyclopentane hydrate in the presence of AA is also proposed.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals
Cyclopentane (CyC5) serving as the hydrate
former was purchased from Aladdin with a purity of 96 wt %. The cyclopentane
hydrate is stable below 7.7 °C, which can ensure that the experiments
can be conducted above the ice point to avoid the ice formation during
the tests. The hydrate antiagglomerant (AA) used in this study was
obtained from Lubrizol Specialty Chemicals (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. It
contains 80–89 wt % cocamidopropyl dimethylamine (see Figure 1), 5–10 wt
% glycerin, a small amount of free amine, and water. The AA was used
as received without further purification. DI water was obtained from
a laboratory purification system (Continental Water System).

Hydrate-Visualization Cell Apparatus
In the present
study, the nucleation and growth of the cyclopentane hydrate were
artificially induced in a hydrate-visualization cell. Figure 2 schematically illustrates
the hydrate formation and recording system. An X90 pipeline steel
plate (1 cm × 1 cm × 0.2 cm) polished using 2000 grit sandpaper
is placed in a transparent rectangular quartz cell. The compositions
of the X90 steel plate are listed in Table 1. The quartz cell is outfitted with a cooling
jacket and filled with cyclopentane or cyclopentane solution with
AA. An external chiller (DC-2006, Ningbo Scientz Biotechnology) with
a precision of ±0.1 °C is connected to the cooling jacket
to control the temperature of the system. At the beginning of each
test, the cyclopentane bath is maintained at −3 °C. A
distilled water droplet (3 μL) is placed on the steel plate,
and the cyclopentane bath is then heated to 1 °C (or 4 °C)
at 1 °C/20 min and kept at constant temperature conditions for
30 min. A small portion of preformed hydrate seed crystals (5 mg)
is then placed at the cyclopentane–water interface with a 50
μm diameter steel wire to initial hydrate nucleation. The cyclopentane
is kept at 1 °C (or 4 °C) for a certain length of time,
allowing the hydrate to fully develop. In each test, the hydrate formation
occurs under static conditions, and the effects of heat transfer are
considered to be ignorable. During the hydrate formation and growth,
a microscope with a CCD camera (DV-100) is used to record a video
of the morphology and growth behavior of the hydrate crystal. Prior
to each test, the cell and the steel plate should be rinsed with distilled
water and acetone and finally dried using a heat gun.

Results and Discussion
Surfactant-Free
Case
Figure 3 shows the sequence of the growth of cyclopentane
hydrate crystals from a distilled water droplet immersed in the cyclopentane
bath without AA at 1 °C. The water contact angle on the polished
X90 pipeline steel plate is determined to be 94.1° (Figure 3a) through ImageJ.21 Shortly after the introduction of a hydrate
crystal seed on the top of the water droplet, the hydrate nuclei grow
laterally along the cyclopentane–water interface, leading to
a polycrystalline hydrate shell as shown in Figure 3c. The hydrate shell spreads from the top
of the water droplet and finally encapsulates the water droplet. Due
to the high subcooling (6.7 °C), the water droplet was fully
covered by the hydrate shell within 10 min after the hydrate crystal
seeding. On the X90 pipeline steel surface, around the water droplet,
a thin hydrate film formed outward from the three-phase contact line
is observed (Figure 3g). The thin hydrate film may be caused by the release of unconverted
water from the interior of the hydrate shell. A similar phenomenon
was observed by Farnham et al.22

Figure 3 Sequential
images of the faceted hydrate shell during the lateral
growth at the interface between distilled water and cyclopentane, T = 1 °C: (a) 0 min; (b) 5 min; (c) 10 min; (d) 30
min; (e) 1 h; (f) 2 h; (g) 3 h; (h) 4 h.

Figure 4 shows the
sequence of hydrate formation and growth of cyclopentane hydrate from
a water droplet similar to those in Figure 3 at a higher temperature (4 °C). After
the seed hydrate crystals were placed on the cyclopentane–water
interface (Figure 4a), no rapid hydrate growth was observed. In the test, the seed hydrate
crystal was observed to gradually move to the bottom of the water
droplet (to the three-phase contact line); during this process, no
noticeable hydrate growth induced by the seed crystal was observed,
which may be due to the low subcooling. As can be seen from Figure 4b,c, both the steel
and the seed crystals can induce the hydrate growth. The hydrate that
starts to form at the steel surface may be nucleated by the seed hydrates
that stick to the steel surface.23 As recognized
by Figures 3 and 4, the time required for a full encapsulation of
the water droplet with the hydrate shell depends on the subcooling.
Due to the low subcooling (3.7 °C), which acts as the driving
force to propagate the hydrate front at the cyclopentane–water
interface, the encapsulation of the water droplet by the hydrate shell
was completed in 1 h (Figure 4e), while only 10 min was needed at 1 °C as shown in Figure 3c. As shown in Figure 4h, after the complete
coverage, no further growth of the hydrate shell was observed in 4
h.

Figure 4 Sequential images of the faceted hydrate shell during the lateral
growth at the interface between distilled water and cyclopentane, T = 4 °C: (a) 0 min; (b) 5 min; (c) 10 min; (d) 30
min; (e) 1 h; (f) 2 h; (g) 3 h; (h) 4 h.

It is also evident that the subcooling affects the morphology of
the hydrate crystals covering the interface. In Figures 3 and 4, hydrate crystals
grew along the interface and formed a polycrystalline shell covering
the water–cyclopentane interface. At 1 °C, for ΔTsub = 6.7 °C, a hydrate shell with a rough
surface was observed (Figure 3), while at 4 °C (ΔTsub = 3.7 °C), a faceted hydrate shell was observed. In Figure 4, the hydrate shell
was smooth compared to that observed in Figure 3, which may be due to the bigger size of
the facets in the hydrate shell. Kishimoto et al.24 reported that the facet size of the faceted cyclopentane
hydrate layer formed at the interface between water and liquid cyclopentane
decreased with subcooling.

Effect of the Hydrate Antiagglomerant (AA)
at 1 °C
The effect of AA on the cyclopentane hydrate
morphology is investigated
in this section. In Figure 5, the AA concentration and temperature are fixed at 0.04 wt
% (based on the weight of the cyclopentane phase) and 1 °C, respectively.
In Figure 5, the entire
coverage of the water–cyclopentane interface by hydrate crystals
occurs at ∼30 min after seeding, indicating that AA could retard
the growth of the hydrate crystals. A hairy and porous hydrate morphology
was observed as compared with the faceted shell formed at the water–cyclopentane
interface in the absence of AA (Figure 4). A similar hairy hydrate morphology caused by the
surfactant was also observed by Karanjkar et al.,16 Nakajima et al.,25 and Aman
et al.26 Aman et al.26 observed a hairy morphology of tetrahydrofuran hydrate
in the presence of Span 20 and hypothesized that the changes in the
hydrate morphology may be attributed to the presence of surfactants
in the bulk liquid phase rather than the hydrate former. Here, we
assume that the formation of a hairy and porous morphology is caused
by the presence of insufficient AA. The AA molecules are considered
to adsorb onto the water–cyclopentane interface before the
seeding of the hydrate crystals at the interface due to its amphibic
nature.5,6,10 Once the cyclopentane
hydrate appears at the interface, some of the AA molecules migrate
from the water–cyclopentane interface to the hydrate surface
due to its hydrate-philic nature.5,6,10,11 After the complete
coverage of the interface with hydrate crystals, the AA molecules
are mostly in the form of the adsorption layer covering the hydrate
shell because of the strong hydrogen bond formed between the AA molecule
and hydrate.5,6 However, because of the insufficient
AA added into the cyclopentane bath, no closely packed adsorption
layer on the hydrate surface could be formed, which leads to the outward
radial flow of the residual water inside the pores of the hydrate
crystal packing as the radial growth of the hydrate continues. The
outward radial flow of the residual water occurs at 1 h (Figure 5e) after seeding,
generates a new water–cyclopentane interface for further hydrate
conversion, and leads to the filling of the void space within the
hydrate packing with cyclopentane, and thus, a hairy and porous morphology
of the hydrate crystals is developed (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Sequential images of hydrate shell growth at
the interface between
water and cyclopentane in the presence of 0.04 wt % AA, T = 1 °C: (a) 0 min; (b) 5 min; (c) 10 min; (d) 30 min; (e) 1
h; (f) 2 h; (g) 4 h; (h) 6 h.

We further increased the concentration of AA in the cyclopentane
bath. Figures 6 and 7 show the sequential images similar to those in Figure 5 at higher AA concentrations
at 1 °C: 0.08 wt % for Figure 6 and 0.12 wt % for Figure 7. In Figures 6 and 7, after the seeding of
the hydrate crystals, the entire coverages of the water–cyclopentane
interface with the hydrate crystal occur at ∼45 and ∼60
min after seeding, respectively. These observations indicate that
AA could further retard the hydrate growth. It should be noted that,
due to the presence of the AA in the cyclopentane bath, the lateral
growth of the hydrate crystals was delayed. Without AA, the lateral
growth occurs shortly after the seeding of the hydrate crystals as
shown in Figure 3.
With the presence of 0.08 wt % AA in the cyclopentane bath, the noticeable
lateral growth of hydrate crystals starts in 2 min after the seeding
of the hydrate crystals (Figure 6). After 3 min of seeding, the noticeable lateral growth
of the hydrate crystals starts in the presence of 0.12 wt % AA (Figure 7).

Figure 6 Sequential images of
hydrate shell growth at the interface between
water and cyclopentane in the presence of 0.08 wt % AA, T = 1 °C: (a) 0 min; (b) 5 min; (c) 10 min; (d) 30 min; (e) 1
h; (f) 2 h; (g) 4 h; (h) 6 h.

Figure 7 Sequential
images of hydrate shell growth at the interface between
water and cyclopentane in the presence of 0.12 wt % AA, T = 1 °C: (a) 0 min; (b) 5 min; (c) 10 min; (d) 1 h; (e) 2 h;
(f) 4 h; (g) 8 h; (h) 16 h.

As recognized in a comparison of Figures 5–7, the hydrate
crystals display an interesting structure when the AA concentration
is higher than 0.04 wt %. After the complete coverage of the water–cyclopentane
interface by the hydrate shell (lateral growth), vertical growth of
the hydrate crystals was observed as shown in Figures 6 and 7. In the past,
the nucleation, lateral growth, and radial growth have been widely
reported by many researchers.13−20 To the best of our knowledge, this is probably the first report
of vertical growth of the cyclopentane hydrate crystals in the presence of a special
surfactant (AA). The vertical growth of the hydrate crystals may be
caused by subcooling and the strong adsorption of AA molecules on
the surface of the hydrate shell and X90 pipeline steel, which will
be explained in detail shortly.

Effect of the Hydrate Antiagglomerant
(AA) at 4 °C
Figure 8 shows the
sequential images similar to those in Figures 6 and 7 at a higher
temperature: 4 °C (ΔTsub =
3.7 °C). In Figure 8, 2 h after the seeding of the hydrate crystals, the noticeable lateral
growth along the water–cyclopentane interface was observed
as shown in Figure 2c. Before the lateral growth starts, the water droplet gradually
spreads on the X90 steel surface, forming a thin water layer. The
formation of the water layer may contribute to the decrease in water–cyclopentane
interfacial tension, which could soften the interface. The coverage
of the water–cyclopentane interface with the hydrate crystal
was complete within 16 h after the introduction of the hydrate seeds.
These observations indicate that the AA product also exhibits a kinetic
inhibition effect. It should be noted that the upward growth of the
hydrate crystals was observed. After the complete water conversion,
the hydrate crystals display a mountain-like morphology due to the
vertical growth of the hydrate. The formation of mountain-like crystals
will be explained shortly.

the interface between
water and cyclopentane in the presence of 0.12 wt % AA, T = 4 °C: (a) 0 min; (b) 30 min; (c) 2 h; (d) 8 h; (e) 12 h;
(f) 14 h; (g) 16 h; (h) 18 h; (i) 20 h; (j) 24 h; (k) 28 h; (l) 32
h.

Proposed Vertical Growth
Mechanism of the Hydrate Crystals
The formation of a gas
hydrate particle formed with a water droplet
is considered to involve nucleation, lateral growth, and radial growth.13−20 In addition to these steps, vertical growth of the gas hydrate was
observed in this study. A proposed vertical growth mechanism of the
hydrate crystals is sketched in Figure 9 and described below.

Figure 9 Schematic of the proposed mechanism of
the hydrate shell upward
growth.

Before the seeding of hydrate
crystals on the water droplet immersed
in the AA/cyclopentane solution, the AA molecules are mostly in the
form of an adsorption layer covering the water droplet and the X90
steel plate as shown in Figure 9a. The adsorption of AA molecules onto the water–cyclopentane
is due to its amphiphilic nature, while the adsorption of AA molecules
onto the X90 steel surface is due to the chemisorption.27,28 Due to the presence of sufficient AA in the cyclopentane bath, some
of the AA molecules are in the form of micelles. After the hydrate
crystals are seeded on the water droplet and the lateral growth of
the hydrate crystals starts, the residual water is encapsulated by
the hydrate shell. Once the hydrate appears at the interface, AA molecules
simultaneously adsorb onto the hydrate surface due to its hydrate-philic
nature5,6 and form a closely packed adsorption layer
after the formation of the hydrate shell (Figure 9b). After the lateral growth, the radial
growth starts and leads to an increase in the pressure of the residual
water inside the hydrate shell. The hydrate shell detaches from the
steel surface because of the increased pressure of the residual water
core, and hence, a new interface for hydrate formation is generated
at the three-phase contact line. The newly formed interface locates
at the bottom of the hydrate shell and is governed by the hydrate
shell as water conversion occurs at the interface, and then radial
growth restarts again, which would increase the pressure of the residual
water inside the hydrate shell. The water–cyclopentane interface
at the bottom of the hydrate shell is regenerated for further hydrate
formation. The formation of the new water–cyclopentane interface
repeatedly occurs until the complete conversion of the residual water
to hydrate, and thus, the vertical growth of the hydrate shell is
observed (Figure 9c).

The morphological changes of the hydrate shell caused by AA may
give insight into the AA’s working mechanism. In Brown’s
thesis,12 the least effective AA was found
to produce almost no visible changes in the morphology of cyclopentane
hydrate, while the highly effective AAs would lead to a significant
change in the hydrate morphology. Based on the morphological changes
of hydrate in the presence of AAs, a working mechanism of the AA,
which was different from the mechanism obtained in rocking cell tests,
has been proposed.12 In this study, we
found that the AA product can significantly affect the morphology
of the hydrate shell, which may imply that the AA product is a highly
effective hydrate antiagglomerant. The AA’s high effectivity
in hydrate antiagglomeration has been verified in some previous reports.5−7 These results from the observation of the morphological changes
may provide a simple prediction of the AA’s performance.

Conclusions
We conducted a set of observations of the morphology
of hydrate
formed with a water droplet immersed in cyclopentane with and without
the presence of a hydrate antiagglomerant (AA). The effect of AA on
the hydrate crystal growth was investigated. The AA exhibited a kinetic
inhibition effect. With no AA, a faceted hydrate shell formed around
the water droplet was observed. The subcooling can affect the rate
of lateral growth. Higher subcooling facilitates hydrate growth. With
the presence of 0.04 wt % AA, a hairy and porous morphology of hydrate
was observed. At higher AA concentrations, a vertical type of growth
after the lateral growth of the hydrate was observed. This is probably
the first report on vertical growth of cyclopentane hydrate formed
with a water droplet. A hypothesis is proposed to explain the vertical
growth mechanism of the hydrate crystals.
