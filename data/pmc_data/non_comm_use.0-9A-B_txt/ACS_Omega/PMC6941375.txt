The development of covalent organic frameworks (COFs)
with nodes
and spacers, designed to maximize their functional properties, is
a challenge. Triazines exhibit better electron affinity than benzene-based
aromatic rings; therefore, structures based on 1,3,5-substituted triazine-centered
nodes are more stable than those from 1,3,5-benzene-linked COFs. Compared
to COFs prepared from flat, rigid sp2 carbon-linked triazine
nodes, the O-linked flexible tripodal triazine-based COF demonstrates
several unpredictable properties such as an increase in crystallinity
and cavity size. In this study, the COF prepared from O-linked flexible
2,4,6-tris(p-formylphenoxy)-1,3,5-triazine serves
as an excellent absorbent for removing methylene blue from water.
Our results demonstrate that COF is highly stable in water and functions
as a robust adsorbent. Its adsorption isotherm is consistent with
the Langmuir model and its adsorption kinetics follows a pseudo-second
order model. Moreover, the COF was characterized using elemental analysis,
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis,
scanning electron microscopy, solid-state ultraviolet–visible
spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. It exhibited permanent porosity,
a high specific surface area (279.5 m2·g–1), and was chemically and thermally stable. Photophysical studies
revealed that the COF exhibits a low bandgap energy value of 3.07
eV, indicating its semiconducting nature.

1 Introduction
Covalent organic frameworks
(COFs) are porous crystalline organic
polymers developed using strong covalent bonds. COFs demonstrate excellent
potential for various applications such as gas storage and separation,1,2 extraction and adsorption,3,4 and optoelectronics5 because of their well-defined crystalline structures,
large specific surface areas, permanent porosities, and high stabilities.6,7 Moreover, COFs exhibit drug delivery,8 heterogeneous catalysis,9−11 photosensitization,12 and sensing properties.13

Typically, COFs are synthesized from rigid building blocks
to ensure
that their porous structures are maintained on activation and/or post-synthesis
modification; however, the design and synthesis of COFs obtained from
flexible monomers2,14 is challenging because of the
high rotational freedom of the flexible units, which makes it considerably
difficult to obtain highly ordered structures with good crystallinity.15 This is a regrettable situation because such
flexibility would facilitate developing diverse COFs with a variety
of functions. For example, COFs obtained from flexible monomers generally
exhibit expandable lattices, making them excellent materials for removing
organic dye pollutants such as methylene blue (MB) from water.4,16

2,4,6-Tris(p-formylphenoxy)-1,3,5-triazine
(TPT-CHO)
is an interesting trigonal molecule that has attracted considerable
attention in the field of two-dimensional (2D) COF synthesis.3,4,9,11−15 TPT-CHO is highly flexible, lacks electrons, contains nitrogen atoms,
and is highly basic, which is beneficial for its combination with
guest metals and dye molecules.

Triazine-centered nodes have
been applied more frequently for developing
COFs than benzene-based nodes.2−5,9,10,12−16 Although the aromaticity indices (IA) for benzene and 1,3,5-triazine are calculated to be
exactly the same (IA = 100),17 many studies have shown that structures obtained
from triazine-centered nodes are more stable than those based on benzene-centered
nodes.18−22 This was demonstrated by studying the electron affinities for a
series of N-heterocyclic molecules,23 which revealed that a molecule will be a good acceptor
when its electron affinity is high. The ability to accept electrons
increased as the number of nitrogen atoms in the benzene ring increased.24 Thus, based on the electron affinities of benzene
and 1,3,5-triazine, the N-heterocyclic triazine molecule
showed superior electron-accepting properties.25,26

In a study of 49 COFs prepared by the combination of 11 spacers
and five sulfono linkers, the diamine spacer 2,2′-dimethyl-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4,4′-diamine
(DMBD) provided the largest surface area.27 The twisting angle, which is attributed to the two methyl groups,
was observed to increase the space between stacking layers; however,
the crystallinity of the resultant COF was not disturbed by this interruption.

Here, we report the design, synthesis, and characterization of
a robust and highly crystalline TPT-DMBD-COF obtained
from the triazine-based flexible linker TPT-CHO as the main building
block. N2 adsorption isothermal analysis revealed that TPT-DMBD-COF has a large Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area of 279.5 m2·g–1. Thus, a detailed kinetic study on the adsorption of the organic
dye MB was conducted to evaluate the properties of TPT-DMBD-COF as a pollutant absorbent.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of the COF
2.1.1 Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) Results
FTIR spectroscopy was used to characterize the as-prepared COF.
The clear band at 1703 cm–1 in the IR spectrum of
TPT-CHO corresponds to the C=O stretching vibration. The sharp
bands in the 3207–3466 cm–1 range in the
spectrum of DMBD are related to the −NH2 groups
of the diamine moieties. In the spectrum of TPT-DMBD-COF, the N–H stretching bands from 3207 to 3466 cm–1 disappeared and the typical C=O stretching band at 1703 cm–1 practically vanished, indicating the consumption
of the aldehyde and amino groups of the monomers. Furthermore, the
resulting characteristic C=N stretching band (1621 cm–1) reveals the successful formation of a macromolecular polymer linked
by imine groups (Figure 1). These observations are in good agreement with the corresponding
values for COF materials reported in the literature.28−30 In summary, FTIR results indicate that a highly polymerized COF
was successfully prepared via condensation.

DMBD, and (c) TPT-DMBD-COF.

2.1.2 Powder X-Ray Diffraction (PXRD) Analysis
The exact structure of the material obtained was determined by
theoretical simulation and PXRD experiments. As shown in Figure 2a, the PXRD pattern
of the COF contains a number of different diffraction peaks. The primary
diffraction peak for the (100) facet was observed at 2.28°, and
the other clearly visible peaks at 3.96, 4.55, 6.00, and 7.92°
are attributed to the (110), (200), (210), and (220) facets, respectively.
The sharp diffraction peaks in the PXRD pattern of the as-prepared
COF demonstrate the material’s excellent crystallinity.

and AB stacking (blue) c PXRD patterns of TPT-DMBD-COF. (b) Views of the AA stacking structure along c and b axes. (c) Views of the AB stacking

The crystal structure was then simulated using
Materials Studio
software, and the results showed that the experimental pattern was
consistent with the simulated pattern based on an eclipsed stacking
(AA) structure (Figure 2b). Pawley refinement produced unit cell parameters of a = b = 45.09 Å; c = 4.35 Å;
α = β = 90°; and γ = 120°, with RP = 3.53% and RWP = 4.98%, which is consistent with the observed pattern. The intensities
of the diffraction peaks for the COF are considerably strong, and
the experimental model is less affected by the baseline. Moreover,
we considered a staggered stacking (AB) model (Figure 2c); however, the simulated PXRD pattern for
AB stacking (Figure 2a, blue line) did not match the experimental results.

2.1.3 Solvent Stability
To achieve a
wide range of applications, the stability of COF in solution must
be evaluated. Hence, as-prepared TPT-DMBD-COF samples
were placed in various solutions for 24 h including an aqueous solution
of HCl at pH = 1, boiling water, an aqueous NaOH solution at pH =
13, dimethylformamide (DMF), MeOH, and acetone. The stability in various
solutions was verified by PXRD and FTIR spectroscopy. The X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns (Figure S2) show that its
crystallinity in each solution remains basically the same. Moreover,
the FTIR spectra (Figure S3) show that
the intensity and position of each characteristic peak are basically
the same, and these results indicate that it can be stably present
in various solutions.

2.1.4 BET Surface Area
To evaluate the
porosity of TPT-DMBD-COF, N2 adsorption–desorption
experiment was performed (Figure 3). The adsorption curve of the COF presents a typical
type-IV isotherm with a rapid uptake at a relatively low pressure
of P/P0 < 0.1, followed
by a second step in the P/P0 range of 0.05–0.20, indicating that the COF was a
mesoporous material. The isotherm angle in the P/P0 range of 0.8–1.0 confirms the presence
of textured mesopores, which is the result of COF crystal aggregation.
Based on the N2 adsorption branch, the BET specific surface
area was calculated to be 279.5 m2·g–1. The total pore volume of the COF was calculated to be 0.50 cm3·g–1 when P/P0 = 1.

Figure 3 (a) N2 absorption–desorption
isotherms of TPT-DMBD-COF and (b) pore size distribution
plot.

The specific surface area and pore size distribution
of COF have
considerable influences on the adsorption. With a large specific surface
area, relatively more adsorption sites would be expected. This could
benefit the adsorption crucially. Furthermore, if the pore size of
the material is too small, e.g., if there are only micropores, then
the adsorbed molecules may be too large to enter the adsorbent, and
adsorption sites inside the adsorbent cannot be completely utilized.
Here, we studied the specific surface area and pore size of TPT-DMBD-COF in detail. Figure 3a shows an adsorption isotherm of the COF at 77 K. Figure 3b is the pore size
distribution plot, as it can be seen, the largest distribution peak
is located at the pore width of 4 nm, which is consistent with the
measurement of modeling COF structure on hexagonal cell. The pore
size distribution plot shows that the COF contains numerous mesopores
and macropores, which could ensure a large number of adsorption sites.
Meanwhile, the maximum size of the MB molecules (14.47 Å) (Figure 4) is much smaller
than the sizes of these pores. They can thus enter the interior of
the TPT-DMBD-COF through these pores and be adsorbed
on sites within the pore structure. Therefore, a relatively high specific
surface area and abundant pore structure are important factors for TPT-DMBD-COF as a robust adsorbent.

2.1.5 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) Morphology
Study
SEM images of TPT-DMBD-COF are shown in Figure 5. The material exhibits
a uniformly distributed and loose block morphology. The SEM image
with a 2 μm scale plate, shows a random-shaped aggregation composed
of many macroscopic tiny balls. Since each individual aggregated particle
is difficult to distinguish with the naked eye, ζ-potentials
(Figure S4) of the adsorbents and analytes
dispersing in ultrapure water were performed to test the particle
size distribution of the COF powder. The result indicates that the
particle size of the COF powder before any adsorption is started at
700 nm and the largest distribution is located at 1000 nm.

(a) and zoom in 200 nm (b).

2.1.6 Thermal Properties
Figure S5 shows the thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) curve of the COF material. The low mass loss during heating
to 100 °C is primarily attributed to the evaporation of residual
solvent molecules from the surface and channels of the COF. As the
temperature continues to increase to 400 °C, significant mass
loss occurs because of the collapse of the macromolecular rings and
decomposition of C–O–C and C=N bonds. However,
the weight loss remains within 50% up to 800 °C; thus, TGA revealed
that the prepared COF has good thermal stability, enabling its practical
applications in high-temperature environments.

TPT-DMBD-COF was calcined at 100, 200, 300, and 400 °C, and PXRD was measured
at each step (Figure 6). The PXRD patterns at 100, 200, and 300 °C were the same as
those at room temperature; however, the PXRD pattern at 400 °C
was considerably altered and exhibited an amorphous shape, thus confirming
that the structure had changed. These results are consistent with
previous TGA test results, further demonstrating the material’s
thermal stability.

at different temperatures.

2.1.7 Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy
The electronic properties of TPT-DMBD-COF were investigated
using solid-state UV–vis spectroscopy and the results were
compared with those of the parent components. The monomers TPT-CHO
and DMBD present absorption bands at 220–280 and 250–330
nm, respectively (Figure 7), whereas the COF exhibited broader absorption bands at 250–400
nm, which were redshifted compared to those of the parent monomers.
This is attributed to the formation of macromolecular rings, which
increases the conjugation of the system and causes the maximum absorption
wavelength to redshift. Thus, TPT-DMBD-COF exhibited
strong absorption and was a highly efficient triazine-based UV absorber.

Figure 7 Solid-state
UV–vis spectra for COF, TPT-CHO,
and DMBD.

Furthermore, the bandgap value for TPT-DMBD-COF was
calculated from the optical diffuse reflectance spectrum. The absorption
(F = α/S) values were calculated
from the reflectance data using the Kubelka–Munk function  where α is the absorption, S is the scattering coefficient, and R is the reflectance
of an infinitely thick layer at a given wavelength. Note that Eg is defined as the intersection point of the
energy axis and a line extrapolated from the linear portion. Interestingly, TPT-DMBD-COF exhibits a low Eg value of 3.07 eV, which clearly indicates the semiconducting properties
of the material (Figure S6). This bandgap
value is lower than those reported for a triazine-based COF constructed
by boroxine linkages (3.6 eV) and the IRMOF series of COFs (∼3.73
eV).31−33

2.2 Organic Dye Removal
2.2.1 Standard Curve
A standard solution
of MB was analyzed using a single-wavelength method, and the maximum
absorption wavelength of MB was found to be 664 nm. Subsequently,
standard solutions with concentrations of 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and
5.0 mg·L–1 were analyzed using UV–vis
spectrophotometry to prepare a curve and derive the curve equation.
Moreover, the measured data were linearly simulated by the least squares
method to obtain a standard curve and a fitting equation for subsequent
dye solution concentration determination (Figure S7).

2.2.2 Adsorption Kinetics
First, 2 mg
samples of TPT-DMBD-COF were added to 5 mL MB solutions
(pH 6.5, unadjusted) at room temperature with an initial concentration
of 5 mg·L–1. The solutions were stirred at
150 rpm for 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90 min, and
the adsorbent was removed using a 0.22 μm microfiltration membrane.
Then, the concentrations of the MB remaining in the solutions were
measured. The adsorption kinetics curve for MB was obtained by analyzing
the adsorption capacity qt (mg·g–1) of the COF for MB at time t using eq 1. 1  In this equation, Co and Ct are the initial and equilibrium
concentrations (mg·L–1), respectively, V is the volume (L) of the added MB solution, and M is the mass of COF (g).

Several kinetic models,
such as pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order, and intra-particle
diffusion models, were applied for interpreting the kinetic nature
of the adsorption process. The appropriate kinetic model was selected
with reference to linear equations, the slope, and R2 values (Figure 8).

Figure 8 (a) Effects of contact time on the adsorption of MB by COF, (b)
pseudo-first order kinetics, (c) pseudo-second order kinetics, and
(d) intra-particle diffusion plots.

For the pseudo-first order model, the curve of
ln(qe – qt) versus t was prepared, and the linear equation
was defined as eq 2. 2  For the pseudo-second order model, the curve
of t/qt versus t was prepared, and the linear equation was defined as eq 3. 3  For the intra-particle diffusion model, the
curve of qt versus t1/2 was prepared, and the linear equation was defined as eq 4. 4  In these equations, qe (mg·g–1) is the amount of adsorption
at equilibrium and qt (mg·g–1) is the amount of adsorption at time t. K1 (min–1), K2 (g·mg–1 min–1), and Ki (mg·g–1 min–1/2) are the adsorption rate constants for
the pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order, and intra-particle diffusion
models, respectively. Moreover, C provides an intercept
related to boundary thickness, and the correlation parameters were
calculated for these models. The results are presented in Table 1.

of MB by COF Absorbents

C1 (mg·g–1)	4.999	
C2 (mg·g–1)	11.48	
R12	0.9974	
R22	0.9896	
To optimize the reaction time, the removal of MB was
studied at
different times in the range of 10–90 min. Figure 8a shows that the adsorption
considerably increases within the first 10 min, and the adsorption
rate rapidly changes. This indicates that this stage primarily involves
surface adsorption. Note that the surface layer was gradually saturated
and the dye molecules began to diffuse into the pores through the
material’s surface and the adsorption rate gradually decreased.
Interestingly, the maximum adsorption of MB was observed after 60
min, which is when equilibrium is reached. The pseudo-first order
kinetic model (Figure 8b), based on adsorption capacity, assumes that dye molecules reaching
the surface of the adsorbent proceed by a diffusion-controlled mechanism
and that only one type of binding site is available on the adsorbent’s
surface. The pseudo-second order kinetic model (Figure 8c) is based on the assumption that the adsorption
rate is controlled by chemisorption, including electron transfer and
sharing between the adsorbent and the adsorbent. Moreover, there are
two types of binding sites on the adsorbent surface. According to
experimental results, the pseudo-second order kinetics has a higher
correlation coefficient R2 (0.9959) than
the pseudo-first order model. Furthermore, the actual measured value
of qexp is highly matched to the theoretically
predicted qcal, which indicates that chemisorption
is involved in the initial stage of adsorption.

Adsorption kinetics
is generally controlled by different mechanisms.
The most important mechanism is the diffusion-controlled mechanism,
although neither the pseudo-first order nor the pseudo-second order
kinetic model expresses the diffusion mechanism. Therefore, to determine
whether diffusion is the rate-limiting step for the adsorption process,
we used the intra-particle diffusion model. Note that this model can
provide relevant information at different stages of the adsorption
process, and Figure 8d shows the linear fit of the experimental results. The figure shows
that the fitted curve is clearly divided into two stages, indicating
that the adsorption of MB by COF can be divided into two stages: film
diffusion and intra-particle diffusion. The film’s diffusion
is the diffusion of the dye molecules into the surface of the adsorbent
in the solution system. At this stage, because the adsorbed molecules
are less resistant, the adsorption rate is quicker and the slope corresponding
to the first-stage curve in the figure is larger. Because the intra-particle
diffusion occurs from the adsorbent’s surface to the inside
and the diffusion resistance is large at this stage owing to the resistance
of the inner pores and the cross-linking gap, the repulsion between
the adsorbed dye molecules and the adsorption speed is relatively
slow until finally the resistance and adsorption are equal and the
adsorption is at an equilibrium. The fitting curve does not pass through
the origin, which indicates that intra-particle diffusion is not a
rate-controlling phase and film diffusion and intra-particle diffusion
may simultaneously occur. The values of R12 and R22 are considerably
close to 100%, indicating that the adsorption process has a high degree
of fit to the intra-particle diffusion model.

2.2.3 Adsorption Isotherms
First, 2 mg
samples of TPT-DMBD-COF were added to 5 mL aliquots of
MB solution (pH 6.5, unadjusted) at room temperature at different
initial concentrations (2–24 mg·L–1)
and stirred at 150 rpm for 2 h. After the adsorption equilibrium was
reached, the adsorbent was removed using a 0.22 μm microfiltration
membrane and the MB concentration remaining in the solution was measured.
The isothermal adsorption line for MB was obtained by analyzing the
relationship between the equilibrium adsorption amount (qe) of COF and the equilibrium concentration (Ce) of the solution. To improve our understanding of the
adsorption process, two commonly used models, i.e., Langmuir and Freundlich,
were introduced to calculate the adsorption isotherms and adsorption
equilibrium points. Both the linear Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption
isotherm equations are expressed as eqs 5 and 6, respectively34 5   6  where Ce (mg·L–1) and qe (mg·g–1) are the equilibrium concentration of the MB and
the adsorption capacity at equilibrium, respectively. Furthermore, KL (L·mg–1) and qmax (mg·g–1) are the
Langmuir adsorption constant and the maximum saturated adsorption
capacity, respectively. Note that KF (mg·L–1) is the Freundlich constant, and 1/n is a constant describing the adsorption density. If n >1, adsorption is favorable and n = 0 indicates
irreversible adsorption.35

As shown
in Figure 9a, with
an increase in equilibrium concentration of MB in the solution, the
adsorption capacity first rapidly increases and then tends to balance.
Typically, the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model is used for single-layer
adsorption, where most of the adsorption sites have the same affinity
for dye molecules. Table 2 lists the fitted data. The correlation coefficient R2 shows that the value of the Langmuir model
(0.9956) is considerably close to 1, and its single-layer adsorption
capacity is 45.45 mg·g–1, which is remarkably
close to the experimental value of qe.
Compared to the Freundlich model (Figure 9b), the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model
(Figure 9c) matches
the adsorption characteristics of MB, i.e., the adsorption sites on
the adsorbent surface have similar properties. Moreover, the adsorption
on the COF surface is single-layer adsorption.

2.2.4 pH
pH is a key
factor for determining the adsorption capacity of an adsorbent because
it affects the charge and adsorption site properties of the adsorbent
surface, the nature of the water, and the structure of dye molecules.36,37 Thus, the effect of pH on MB adsorption was investigated. As the
initial pH value increased in the range of 2–10, the adsorption
amount showed a significant increasing trend, indicating that the
pH of the dye solution is indeed a considerably important factor for
adsorption (Figure 10). When the pH of the MB solution was low, the MB solution was acidic,
and a large amount of H+ and MB (positively charged in
the aqueous solution) competed with each other. Thus, under acidic
conditions, the adsorption amount and rate of MB by the COF were relatively
low. When the MB solution was alkaline (pH is close to 10), the adsorption
amount reached a maximum of 12.31 mg·g–1. Thus,
the results indicate that neutral or alkaline conditions favor MB
adsorption by the COF because the surface groups of the COF are electronegative
under neutral or alkaline conditions.

on the adsorption of MB.

2.2.5 Recyclability Test
To evaluate
the recycling performance of TPT-DMBD-COF, an experiment
of MB adsorption–desorption was carried out using UV–vis
spectroscopy. The COF material was added to an MB solution with an
initial concentration of 5 mg·L–1. After adsorption,
the supernatant was centrifuged. The concentration of the filtrate
(remaining MB solution) was determined and the adsorption rate was
calculated. The residue material (COF-MB composite) was ultrasonically
shaken by adding a methanol solution containing 0.1 mM HCl. The solution
then changed from colorless to blue, indicating that the adsorbed
MB had been desorbed, and the COF material was again separated by
centrifugation. After washing and drying the residue, the above experimental
steps were repeated. Figure 11 shows that after five repetitions of these steps, the adsorption
rate of the material exceeded 90%, indicating that the TPT-DMBD-COF can indeed adsorb and desorb MB, has excellent recyclability and
sustainability and has great potential for use in dye adsorption.

2.2.6 Adsorption Mechanism
To clarify
the adsorption mechanism, as shown in Figure 12, we studied the ζ-potential of TPT-DMBD-COF under different pH conditions. The ζ-potential
decreased from 19 to −56 mV with an increase in pH. Moreover,
the adsorption capacity increased with an increase in pH, reaching
a maximum when the pH was 10. This indicates that there was an electrostatic
attraction between the cationic MB dye molecule and TPT-DMBD-COF.

Figure 12 Plot of ζ-potential changes with pH.

We also performed infrared spectroscopy for MB, TPT-DMBD-COF, and the TPT-DMBD-COF-MB composite
(Figure S9). Moreover, we determined that
the positions and
intensities of some absorption peaks changed after TPT-DMBD-COF adsorption of MB. The characteristic absorption peaks at 1566 cm–1, those of the aromatic rings at 819 cm–1, and those of the triazine rings were redshifted (compared to the
original values of 1568 and 816 cm–1, respectively).
Moreover, the intensities of those characteristic peaks also significantly
weakened because the TPT-DMBD-COF adsorbent contains
many aromatic rings that undergoes π–π stacking
with the MB molecules during adsorption.

To further demonstrate
that MB enters the TPT-DMBD-COF channels, we performed
gas adsorption–desorption test on
the adsorbed TPT-DMBD-COF-MB composite. Figure S10 shows the N2 adsorption and desorption
curve of the TPT-DMBD-COF-MB composite. BET calculation
shows that the specific surface area of the composite material is
abruptly reduced to 11.18 m2 g–1. The
reduction in the specific surface area of TPT-DMBD-COF indicates that MB has indeed entered the COF pores and occupied
the cavity.

Based on these experiments, it can be clearly stated
that adsorption
is not simply a guest–host interaction based on appropriately
sized cavities in the COF structure and that the chemical structure
and adsorption characteristics of the adsorbent and MB play an important
role in the process. Moreover, a possible mechanism to rationalize
all of the observations is proposed. Because MB is a typical cationic
dye with a planar structure held together by aromatic rings and the
COF also has a large number of aromatic rings, π–π
stacking is observed. Note that COF contains a large amount of electron-rich
atoms such as N and O (containing a lone pair of electrons) and is
regarded as an electron-donating Lewis base, whereas the cationic
dye is regarded as a Lewis acid. According to the Lewis acid–base
reaction principle, these N and O atoms can attract cationic dye molecules
during the adsorption process. Moreover, the relatively large specific
surface area and pore structure of the adsorbent can provide abundant
adsorption sites. These three factors synergistically promote the
adsorption of MB by COF.

3 Conclusions
In summary, this study
reports the design and development of a
new COF, namely, TPT-DMBD-COF, from the condensation
of the O-linked, flexible, triazine-based aldehyde TPT-CHO and the
rigid diamine DMBD. The sharp diffraction peaks in the PXRD pattern
are consistent with theoretical simulations, confirming a highly ordered,
AA stacked hexagonal structure in the synthesized COF. Moreover, this
material has a large BET surface area of 279.5 m2·g–1. The high porosity of the 2D COF holds the promise
of excellent performance for removing MB. Our results demonstrate
that the COF is highly stable in water and functions as a robust adsorbent.
Moreover, different kinetic models were investigated, and the pseudo-second
order model was found to provide the best fit. Based on these kinetic
studies and the organic structure of MB, we proposed a reasonable,
detailed mechanism to explain the entire adsorption process. This
study demonstrates the potential of a new COF absorbent for use in
environmental pollution cleanup with properties such as high efficiency,
eco-friendliness, ease of preparation, and absence of byproducts.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Methods
All reagents
and solvents were of analytical grade and used as received without
further purification. TPT-CHO was synthesized from cyanuric chloride
and p-hydroxy benzaldehyde (Scheme 1). Column chromatography was performed using
silica gel (Merck, Kieselgel 60, 200–300 mesh) with the indicated
eluents. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on
KBr pellets in the range of 400–4000 cm–1 at 2 cm–1 resolution using a DIGILAB FTS-3000
spectrometer. ζ-Potentials of the adsorbent and analytes dispersing
in ultrapure water were measured on a ζ-potential analyzer (Zetasizer
Nano ZS, Malvern Panalytical, U.K.). Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD)
patterns were obtained on a Philips PW 1710-BASED diffractometer at
293 K. Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption spectra
were measured on a Varian Cary 100 UV–vis spectrophotometer
equipped with an integrating sphere attachment and a standard BaSO4 plate as a reference. The concentrations of the dye solutions
were determined using UV–vis spectrophotometry (model: 722,
Shanghai Electronics and Instrument Analysis Co., Ltd.). Morphology
analysis was performed using an ULTRA Plus scanning electron microscope
(SEM, Germany). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential
thermal analysis of the samples were performed at a heating rate of
10 °C min–1 under N2 atmosphere
with a NETZSCH Instruments thermal analyzer (STA449C). N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured on an Autosorb
iQ Station (QuantaChrome Instruments V 5.0) at 77 K, and the surface
area was calculated by the BET method. AA stacking and AB stacking
molecular models and Pawley refinement of TPT-DMBD-COF were performed using the Materials Studio software.

4.2 Synthesis of TPT-DMBD-COF
First,
TPT-CHO (88.4 mg, 0.2 mmol) and DMBD (63.7 mg, 0.3 mmol) were dissolved
in mesitylene/dioxane (1:1, v/v, 4 mL) and sonicated at room temperature
for about 10 min to obtain a uniform dispersion. Subsequently, acetic
acid (AcOH, 6 M, 0.4 mL) was slowly added, and the resulting mixture
was sealed in an air-isolated glass bottle and transferred to a 25
mL Teflon-lined stainless steel container for heating at 80 °C
for 3 days. After the temperature of the container reached room temperature,
the yellow precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed
with anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF) and methanol until the washings were colorless to remove the
trapped guest molecules and solvents. Finally, the COF was dried at
50 °C under vacuum for 12 h (Scheme 1). TPT-DMBD-COF was obtained
as a yellow powder (92.1 mg, yield 65.2%). Anal. Calc. for (C90H66O6N12)n: C, 76.58; N, 11.91%. Results: C, 72.47; N, 15.31%. IR
