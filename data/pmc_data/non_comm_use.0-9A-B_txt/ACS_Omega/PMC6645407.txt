Molecular
dynamics simulation studies were employed to investigate
the microscopic behaviors of CH4 and CO2 molecules
in slit-nanopores (SNPs) with various surfaces and different compositions.
Three kinds of SNPs were constructed by a pair-wise combination of
graphene, silica, and the calcite surface. The grand canonical Monte
Carlo and molecular dynamics simulation methods were used to investigate
the adsorption and self-diffusion of the gases in the nanopores. It
is found that in all three cases, the CH4 molecules prefer
to adsorb onto the graphene surface, whereas the CO2 molecules
prefer to adsorb onto the calcite surface. The adsorption intensity
of gases adsorbed onto various surfaces, the adsorption distances,
along with the details of adsorption orientations of CH4 and CO2 molecules on various surfaces are calculated.
The surface characteristics, such as surface roughness and charge
distribution, are analyzed to help understand the microscopic adsorption
behaviors of the gases on the specific surface. It was found that
competitive adsorptions of CO2 over CH4 broadly
occurred, especially in the SNPs containing calcite, because of the
strong adsorption interactions between the CO2 molecules
and the calcite surface. This work provides the microbehaviors of
CH4 and CO2 in SNPs with various surfaces in
different compositions to provide useful guidance for better understanding
about the microstate of gases in complex nanoporous shale formation
and to give out useful guidance for enhancing shale gas recovery by
injecting CO2.

1 Introduction
The
extraction of unconventional natural gas has captured great
attention because of global energy shortage and the increasing demand
of energy consumption in the global energy markets.1−6 Shale gas, as one of the remarkable unconventional resources, has
been successful exploited and commercially used in the last decade,
especially in the U.S.7 Recently, to avoid
serious environmental issues caused by the high-volume hydraulic fracturing,8−10 a promising technique was put forward by injecting CO2 to enhance shale gas recovery (CO2-EGR), apart from overcoming the problems of shale gas extraction, which also could
achieve CO2 capture and storage to conquer the environmental
issue of global climate.11,12 Understanding the microscopic
behaviors of CH4 and CO2 in nanoporous shale
is crucial for the progress of the CO2-EGR technique.

Shale is a complex sedimentary rock, which has consolidated and
deposited sediments with various chemical compositions, and according
to the literature, the inorganic minerals and organic matter constitute
the main body of shale.13−15 As it is well-known, ultralow
permeability is the principal feature of the shale reservoir, and
vast majority of shale gas is adsorbed in the nanoscaled pores of
shale formation.16,17 Because the structure of the
nanoporous shale is very complex, a lot of uncertainty always exists
for the shale gas reserve due to the very variety of the shale layer
condition, let along the shale gas extraction. Investigation
of the microscopic behaviors of gases in shale is essential for the
revolution of EGR techniques, which is obviously not easy, whereas
the computer simulation provides a feasible way.

Recently, the
adsorption of CH4 and CO2 in
nanoporous matters, including zeolites, metal organic frameworks,
and mimic nanopores of the layer, has been intensively studied by
computer simulations,18,19 which provides relevant information and throws some light in the
area of CO2-EGR.20−25 The carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphite slabs have been used to
represent the nanopore surface, and the differences in the adsorption
of CH4 and CO2 on the graphene surface and the
displacement of CH4 by CO2 in CNTs have been
examined.20,26 Meanwhile, the nanoporous carbons have also
been used to represent the nanopores occupied by the organic matter,
and the competitive adsorption properties of CO2 over CH4 have been extensively studied.21,22,25 Beyond that, the inorganic minerals of quartz, calcite,
and clay have been often employed to represent the shale formation.27−29 In our previous work, we have examined the competitive adsorption
of CO2 over CH4 and the displacement of CH4 by CO2 in shale nanopores of inorganic minerals30−32 and organic matter (kerogen).33 The above
research provided meaningful knowledge, however, most of the current
studies merely focused on the unique sorbent with a single component.
The microbehaviors of CH4 and CO2 in nanopores
containing different surfaces with various chemical compositions are
still unclear, which is what we desire to figure out.

In this
study, three kinds of slit-nanopores (SNPs) were constructed
by a pair-wise combination of different surfaces of graphene, silica,
and calcite. The grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) and molecular
dynamics (MD) methods were used to investigate the adsorption and
self-diffusion of CH4 and CO2 in SNPs, and the
influences of the chemical composition variation along with the change
in the pore size were examined. The learning got from this work could
enrich the theoretical knowledge about the microbehaviors of CH4 and CO2 in shale nanopores with different surface
compositions and should provide useful guidance in CO2-EGR.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Adsorption and Self-Diffusion
of CH4 in SNPs with Various Surfaces
The absolute
adsorption isotherms
of CH4 as a single component in the specifically constructed
SNPs with different surfaces are shown in Figure 1. It is found that the adsorption amount
of CH4 increases with the enlarged pressure and decreases
with the increasing temperature; the characteristics of the adsorption
isotherms are similar to the research about adsorption of CH4 in various monocomposited nanoporous matters.21,27 It can also be found that the adsorption capacities of CH4 in SNPs with the graphene surface (Figure 1a,b) are slightly larger than those in SNPs–c composed of silica and calcite surface (Figure 1c), which might be
attributed to the stronger adsorption interactions between the CH4 molecules and the graphene surface, as discussed below.

Figure 1 Adsorption
isotherms of CH4 as a single component in
constructed pair-wise two-component SNPs at different temperatures:
(a) SNPs–g composed of silica and graphene surface,
(b) SNPc–g composed of calcite and graphene surface,
and (c) SNPs–c composed of silica and calcite surface.

The density distribution of CH4 adsorbed in SNPs with
various surfaces is shown in Figure 2. It is found that the density of the tight adsorption
layer (TAL) of CH4 close onto the graphene surface is larger
than that adsorbed close onto other surfaces; it reaches saturated
state rapidly as the pressure increases; and it demonstrates that
the CH4 molecules have stronger adsorption capacity onto
the graphene surface. From Figure 2, it can also be found that the distances from the
TALs to the adjacent pore surfaces are different, with the nearest
distance to the silica surface and the farthest distance to the graphene
surface.

Figure 2 Density profiles of CH4 in various SNPs of SNPs–g (a), SNPc–g (b), and SNPs–c (c)
with a pore width of ∼2 nm and the variation of pressure at
323 K.

To investigate the detailed adsorption
characteristics of the CH4 molecule adsorbed close onto
the various surfaces, the optimal
adsorption sites and adsorption energy (Eads) of the gas molecule on different surfaces were investigated, and Eads can be expressed as33 1  in which Ea is
the energy of the gas species, Es is the
energy of the sorbent, and Ea+s is the
total energy of the gas molecule adsorbed on the sorbent surface.
As shown in Figure 3, the CH4 molecule prefers to adsorb onto the hollow site
of the graphene surface with a distance of 3.42 Å, which is consistent
with the research work by Yuan et al.20 For the adsorption of the CH4 molecule onto the calcite
surface, the CH4 molecule adsorbed right above the positive
site of Ca2+, with a distance of 2.25 Å. Meanwhile,
the CH4 molecule adsorbed above the concave site and was
surrounded by the hydroxyl groups on the silica surface, with a distance
of 2.03 Å. These can be explained by the different distances
from the TALs of CH4 to the various pore surfaces, as mentioned
in Figure 2, which
also demonstrates that the surface roughness also plays an important
role in the adsorption of gases onto the surfaces, in addition to
the different surface charge distributions. It can also be seen that Eads of the CH4 molecule adsorbed
onto the graphene surface (Eads-graphene = −2.94 kcal/mol) is weaker than those on the surfaces of
calcite (Eads-calcite = −2.74
kcal/mol) and silica (Eads-silica = −2.39 kcal/mol), which further demonstrates that the CH4 molecule has the strongest adsorption interactions on the
graphene surface. The transformation of the single CH4 molecule
adsorbed on various surfaces from the initial optimal adsorption site
to the finial stable adsorption site is shown in Figure S1.

Figure 3 Stable adsorption configurations of a single CH4 molecule
adsorbed onto different surfaces of (a) graphene, (b) calcite, and
(c) silica.

The effects of the changing
pore size (6–30 Å) on the
adsorption behaviors of CH4 molecules in nanopores with
various surfaces are shown in Figure S2; it is found that in the small nanopore with a pore width of ∼6
Å, the CH4 molecules adsorbed inside the nanopores
as a single layer because of the pore size limitation, and the CH4 molecules prefer to adsorb close onto the pore surface as
the pore size increases.27 Meanwhile, the
density of CH4 adsorbed inside the nanopores close to the
graphene surface side is always larger than those on the other sides,
owing to the strong affinity of CH4 with the graphene surface,
as mentioned above.

The microscopic diffusion properties of
CH4 molecules
located within the TALs close onto the different surfaces as pore
size changes were studied by the self-diffusion coefficients (Ds) with the following equation27 2  where ri(t) is the position
of molecule i at time t and ri(0) is the initial position.
As shown in Figure 4, Ds of CH4 molecules adsorbed
onto different surfaces can be demonstrated
as Ds-graphene < Ds-calcite < Ds-silica, which further demonstrates that the CH4 molecules have
stronger adsorption interactions with the graphene surface than with
other surfaces. It can also be found that Ds of CH4 adsorbed close onto the various surfaces increases
gradually with increasing pore size.30

different surfaces vs the pore size variation at P = 10 MPa and T = 323 K.

2.2 Adsorption and Self-Diffusion of CO2 in SNPs with Various Surfaces
The absolute adsorption isotherms
of CO2 as a single component in SNPs with different surfaces
are shown in Figure 5; it is found that the adsorption capacity of CO2 is stronger
than CH4 in SNPs with different surfaces, which is also
in agreement with our previous works that CO2 has stronger
adsorption in various nanopores in comparison with CH4.30−34 From Figure 5, it
can also be found that the CO2 molecules have more intense
adsorption process at the initial low pressures in the SNPs with the
calcite surface (Figure 5b,c), which might be attributed to the strong adsorption interactions
between the CO2 molecules and the calcite surface.35

Figure 5 Adsorption isotherms of CO2 as a single component
in
SNPs at various temperatures; (a) SNPs–g, (b) SNPc–g, and (c) SNPs–c.

The density distribution of CO2 adsorbed
in the SNPs
(d ≈ 2 nm) with various surfaces in different
compositions are shown in Figure 6; it can be found that the adsorption of CO2 reaches saturated state rapidly from the initial low pressures on
the calcite surface, which indicates that CO2 has a stronger
adsorption intensity on the calcite surface.31 Similar to the CH4 adsorption in the nanopores, the CO2 molecules also have the largest density distribution close
onto the graphene surface; it is mainly because of the close-packed
arrays of CO2 molecules on the graphene surface that generates
the large adsorption loading. The TALs of CO2 also have
the nearest distance to the adjacent silica surface and farthest distance
to the graphene surface. In contrast to CH4, the peak widths
of the density distribution of CO2 within TALs close onto
various surfaces are different, with the largest peak width close
to the calcite surface and the smallest peak width close to the graphene
surface; it is mainly because of the different adsorption orientations
of CO2 adsorbed onto the various surfaces, as discussed
below.

Figure 6 Density profiles of CO2 in various SNPs of SNPs–g (a), SNPc–g (b), and SNPs–c (c)
with a pore width of ∼2 nm and the variation of pressure at
323 K.

The microscopic state of the CO2 molecule adsorbed onto
the various pore surfaces is shown in Figure 7; it is found that the CO2 molecule
prefers to adsorb at the bridge site of the C–C bond, with
two C=O bonds pointing toward the hollow sites of the neighboring
carbon rings20 with a distance of 3.35
Å. The CO2 molecule adsorbed onto the calcite surface
with an orientation that one of the O atoms of CO2 was
attracted to the positive site of Ca2+,31 with a distance of 1.92 Å from the surface. Meantime,
the CO2 molecule adsorbed onto the silica surface with
a distance of 1.69 Å and with the orientation of one of the O
atoms of CO2 attracted to the hydroxyl group; it is because
that the hydrogen bond can be formed between the O atoms of the CO2 molecule and the hydroxyl group, according to the research
work of Le at al.28 It can also be found
that Eads of the CO2 molecule
adsorbed onto the calcite surface (Eads-calcite = −19.20 kcal/mol) is much weaker than those on the surfaces
of graphene (Eads-graphene = −3.92
kcal/mol) and silica (Eads-silica = −6.56 kcal/mol), which demonstrates that the CO2 molecule has the strongest adsorption interactions on the calcite
surface. Comparing with the CH4 molecule adsorbed on various
surfaces, the Eads value of CO2 is much weaker than that of CH4 on each surface, which
further demonstrates that CO2 has stronger adsorption interactions
with the various surfaces than CH4, especially on the calcite
surface. The variation in the adsorption configurations of the single
CO2 molecule adsorbed on different surfaces from the initial
optimal adsorption site to the finial stable adsorption site is shown
in Figure S3.

Figure 7 Stable adsorption configurations
of a single CO2 molecule
adsorbed onto different surfaces of (a) graphene, (b) calcite, and
(c) silica.

The angle θ formed
between the CO2 backbone and
the pore surfaces was quantified to investigate the difference in
orientations for CO2 adsorbed within the TALs close onto
various surfaces; θ is 0° or 180°represents that the
CO2 molecule is perpendicular to the surface, and with
θ equal to 90°, CO2 lays parallel to the surface
(Figure 8a).28 It is found that CO2 adsorbed onto
the graphene surface mainly parallel to the surface with θ ≈
90°, whereas CO2 adsorbed onto the silica and calcite
surface with θ ≈ 50° (∼130°) and ≈20°
(∼160°), respectively.

Figure 8 (a) Schematic of the orientation of one
adsorbed CO2 molecule and, (b) probability distribution
for the angle θ
of CO2 molecules adsorbed within the TALs close onto the
pore surface.

The adsorption density
distribution of CO2 adsorbed
in SNPs with various surfaces as the pore size changes (6–30
Å) is shown in Figure S4. In contrast
to CH4 adsorption in the small pore with a pore width of
∼6 Å, CO2 has two adsorption layers in SNPs–c (Figure S4c), which might
be because of the smaller adsorption distance of CO2 molecules
onto the silica and calcite surfaces. With the pore size increasing,
the CO2 molecules also adsorb close onto the pore surface
preferentially. The peak width and distance to the surfaces of the
TALs of CO2 are in accordance with that mentioned above.

The self-diffusion of CO2 molecules adsorbed within
the TALs onto different surfaces is shown in Figure 9; it can be found that the Ds-calcite of CO2 is much smaller than Ds-graphene and Ds-silica, which further demonstrates that CO2 has stronger adsorption interactions with the calcite surface. Ds of CO2 also gets enlarged with
the increasing pore size.30 However, in
contrast to CH4 (Figure 4), the Ds values of CO2 are much smaller, which demonstrates that the CO2 molecules have stronger adsorption capacities on pore surfaces.

coefficients of CO2 adsorbed close onto the
different surfaces vs the pore size variation at P = 10 MPa and T = 323 K.

2.3 Competitive Adsorption of CO2 over
CH4 in SNPs with Various Surfaces
The selectivity
parameter (S) was employed to perform the competitive
adsorption of CO2 over CH4 in SNPs, which can
be expressed as36 3  where x is the fraction of
the gas component in the adsorbed phase and y is
the fraction of the gas component in the bulk phase. As shown in Figure 10, the competitive
adsorption of CO2 over CH4 in nanopores with
various surfaces broadly occurs because of the different adsorption
properties of CH4 and CO2 onto various surfaces.
It is found that S is always larger than 2 in SNPs–g, which increases gradually with the enlarged pressure
and decreases with the increasing temperature (Figure 10a). The adsorption densities of the binary
mixed CH4 and CO2 in SNPs–g at 323 K are shown in Figure S5a,d, respectively,
and it can be found that the adsorption density of CO2 is
larger and prefers to adsorb onto the pore surface compared with CH4; so, the competitive adsorption mainly occurs at the pore
surfaces.

Figure 10 Selectivity of CO2 over CH4 in SNPs–g (a), SNPc–g (b), and SNPs–c (c)
as a function of pressure at various temperatures.

The selectivity of CO2 over CH4 in SNPg–c is shown in Figure 10b; it is found that S is
very large
at the initial low pressure and decreases acutely with increasing
pressure. Meanwhile, a reversal point exists at a pressure of ∼1
MPa, before which the high temperature is beneficial to the competitive adsorption and turns into negative beyond the
reversal point. It is because at the initial stage of adsorption,
the temperature has obvious influence on the CH4 adsorption,
but a slight influence on CO2 adsorption in SNPg–c; therefore, the higher temperature has significant contributions
to the competitive adsorption of CO2 over CH4 at the initial stage. According to the adsorption density shown
in Figure S5b,e, it can be found that the
competitive adsorption mainly occurs at the side of the calcite surface.

The selectivity of CO2 over CH4 in SNPs–c is shown in Figure 10c, and it is similar to the competitive adsorption
of CO2 over CH4 in SNPg–c. S in SNPs–c is also very large at the
initial stage, with a reversal point at a pressure of ∼1.3
MPa. The high temperature also has significant contributions to S before the reversal point and negative influences on S beyond that point. Figure S5c,f also indicates that the competitive adsorption mainly occurs at
the pore surface, especially at the side of the calcite surface.

The adsorption isotherms of CH4 and CO2 molecules
as binary mixtures in various SNPs are shown in Figure S6; it can also be seen clearly that CO2 has a stronger adsorption capacity in various SNPs than CH4. The characteristics of the competitive adsorption of CO2 and CH4 as binary mixtures in SNPs with different surfaces
are consistent with those in silica nanopores, as described in our
previous work.34 CO2 also has
stronger adsorption at the initial adsorption process in the SNPs
with the calcite surface, and it is in agreement with the CO2 adsorption as a single component in SNPs.

To further investigate
the differences in the adsorption intensities
of gases adsorbed onto various surfaces, isosteric heats (Qst) was employed to calculate the adsorption
intensity of CH4 and CO2 in nanopores with the
following equation,37 4  in which Rg is
the gas constant, T is the temperature, Nad is the number of adsorbates and Uad is the adsorption energy. As shown in Figure 11, the values of Qst of CO2 are larger than those of CH4 in general, especially Qst of CO2 in SNPcalcite, which has a large value at the
initial stage and decreases with the enhanced adsorption amount. That
is because the interaction between the CO2 molecule and
the calcite surface is very strong at the initial stage, whereas less
favorable sorption sites would exist as the adsorption loading gets
enlarged,37 which further reveals that
CO2 has strong adsorption interactions with the calcite
surface. Although in SNPgraphene and SNPsilica, the Qst values of CO2 are
smaller compared with that in SNPcalcite, there is a slight
increase from the value of 5 to 6 as the adsorption loading is enlarged,
and the slight increase in the value of Qst could be attributed to the contributions of the adsorption enthalpy caused by the intermolecular
interactions of gases.23 In contrast to
CO2, the Qst values of CH4 are small, and it can be found that the Qst of CH4 adsorbed in the SNPgraphene is larger than that adsorbed in SNPsilica and SNPcalcite, which further reveals that CH4 has stronger
adsorption interactions onto the graphene surface.25,38

amount (percentage) at T = 323 K.

3 Conclusions
In this
study, the microbehaviors of CH4 and CO2 in
SNPs with various surface compositions were investigated
by MD simulations. It is found that the CH4 molecules prefer
to adsorb onto the graphene surface, whereas the CO2 molecules
adsorb onto the calcite surface preferentially. Meanwhile, the adsorption
energy of the single molecule of CH4 and CO2 adsorbed onto different surfaces and the isosteric heats of gases
affected by the different surface compositions are examined to give
out the verification. In addition to the surface charge properties,
the surface roughness also plays an important role in the adsorption
of gases, and both work together on the adsorption state of gases
in nanopores, including the various adsorption distances to the pore
surfaces and the various adsorption orientations of CO2 on different surfaces. The effects of pore size variation on the
adsorption and self-diffusion of CH4 and CO2 in SNPs were also examined. A competitive adsorption of CO2 over CH4 broadly occurs in SNPs, especially in nanopores
with the calcite surface because of the stronger adsorption interactions
between the CO2 molecules and the calcite surface. This
work provides the microbehaviors of CH4 and CO2 in SNPs with various surfaces in different compositions to provide
useful guidance for better understanding about the gas behaviors in
complex nanoporous shale and might give out useful guidance in CO2-EGR.

4 Models and Methods
4.1 Atomistic Models
Three kinds of SNPs
with different surfaces were constructed, and each rectangular simulation
box with the linear dimensions of Lx = 30.5 Å, Ly = 27 Å, and Lz was used to adjust the pore width, as shown in Figure 12. The exposed surface of silica was obtained by cleaving the
surface along the (001) crystallographic orientation,38 the calcite surface was cleaved along the (101̅4)
crystallographic surface according to the literature,29,39 and graphene was employed to represent the surface with the organic
matter.26 The whole sorbents were regarded
as rigid during the simulations, and all parameters were derived from
the COMPASS40 force field. For adsorbates,
a three-site and a five-site model was used to describe the CO241 and CH442 molecule, respectively; the atomic charges and
bond lengths are listed in Table S1.

Ca in green, Si in yellow, and H in white.

4.2 Computer Simulation Details
The COMPASS40 force field was used to perform the whole simulation
in this study, and the nonbonded interactions were performed by the
Lennard-Jones and Coulombic potentials with the following equation37 5   6   7  in which εij is the well depth, rij0 is the separation for
a pair of atoms i and j, and q is the charge of the atoms. The 6th order combining rules
were used to estimate the cross-potential parameters of εij and rij0.

As described
in our previous work,33 the GCMC method
was used to examine the adsorption of CH4 and CO2 in SNPs by using the Sorption package of Materials Studio (MS).
The acceptance or rejection of a trial move was performed by the Metropolis
algorithm.43 The van der Waals and electrostatic
interactions were described by the Lennard-Jones 9-6 potential and
Coulombic term, respectively, with a cut-off distance of 10 Å.
Each equilibration and calculation process had 5 × 106 steps, respectively. The MD method was employed to investigate the
self-diffusion of CH4 and CO2 in SNPs by using
the Forcite package of MS. The NVT ensemble was employed with the
temperature thermostat of Nosé–Hoover, and each MD simulation
process has a run time of 5.0 ns with a time step of 1 fs; the last
1.0 ns was used for the analysis. Meanwhile, the Adsorption Locator
package of MS was used to determine the initial optimal adsorption
site of the single gas molecule on various surfaces by a simulated
annealing process,44 and the final stable
adsorption site was obtained after the geometry optimization by using
the DMol3 package;45 the energy
of configuration was also calculated by the DMol3 package.
The generalized gradient approximation and Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof46 were employed to describe the exchange–correlation
interaction, and the density functional semicore pseudopotential47 method with the localized double-numerical basis
with a polarization functional was employed.
