A gel
system composed of acrylamide (AM), N,N′-methylenebisAM (BIS), and ammonium persulfate
((NH4)2S2O8) was developed
and applied extensively in reservoirs to reduce water cut and increase
oil production in mature fields. However, this gel system suffers
from thermal stability loss and syneresis at high temperatures that
reduces its ability to control water flow. It has been widely accepted
that the loss of gel thermal stability can be explained via three
aspects: the rupture of polymer chains, the breakage of cross-linker
chains, and hydrolysis of polymer. The mechanism of hydrogel syneresis
through polymer hydrolysis has been investigated extensively in other
publications. However, research on the other two mechanisms is quite
limited. In this article, we conduct a series of experiments to demonstrate
how the rupture of polymer and cross-linker chains leads to the hydrogel
instability at high temperatures. Viscosity and energy-dispersive
system measurements suggested that polyAM chains were disrupted by
the oxidation reactions involving free radicals. The method to measure
the cross-linking degree was established and in combination with X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, the results showed that cross-linker
chains were broken as a result of weaker C–N bond resulting
from positively charged mesomethylene carbon and hydrolysis of amide
groups on the cross-linker. Because of the application of deionized
water in the experiments, nuclear magnetic resonance and FTIR measurements
showed that the hydrolysis degree of polymer was weak. Hence, our
results verified that breakage of polymer and cross-linker chains
led to the rupture of the gel network at high temperature. Besides,
cross-linker chains may play a more important role in the thermal
stability of the gel, which explains some work into high-temperature-resistant
gels.

==== Body
Introduction
Because of the oil-field development in
China, many mature oil
fields have entered into the high water-cut stage. Because of the
formation of heterogeneity, injected waters will break along the highly
permeable channels and reduce oil recovery efficiency. It is reported
that the water content can reach up to 90% of the fluid brought to
the surface for production in mature oil fields.1,2 Excess
water content has made the water flooding measurements uneconomical
and has increased the cost related to water/oil separation, scale,
corrosion, and well shut-in.3,4 Thus, the control of
unwanted water production has been a huge challenge for oil-field
operators.5

Recently, polymer gels
have been developed to modify the water
injection profile and enhance oil recovery.6−8 Polymer gels
possess a uniform three-dimensional network structure and are formed
by cross-linking the polymer molecules with a cross-linker. The most
commonly used polymers are polyacrylamide (PAM), partially hydrolyzed
polyAM (HPAM), and AM copolymers such as N-vinyl
pyrrolidone, 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-propanesulfonate, and N-vinyl acetamide.9−12 Cross-linking agents used in polymer gels are mainly organic cross-linkers
and metallic cross-linkers such as Cr3+, Al3+, and Zr4+.13−15 Besides, a novel nanocomposite
hydrogel consisting of layered double hydroxide has been developed
by Chen.16−18 These hydrogels have ultrahigh tensibility and hierarchical
porous structure and can overcome the mechanical weakness and brittleness
or poor deformability of general gel system. When the gelant solution
was injected into the reservoirs, the fluids tend to preferentially
enter into high-permeability zones and form effective plugging for
large pore throats. Therefore, the subsequent injected water will
be diverted into the low-permeability zones and displace the remaining
oil. This improves the sweep efficiency and oil recovery.

However,
the gel used for profile modification suffers syneresis
problems with strength degradation at high temperatures.19,20 Gel syneresis will cause plugging failure in high permeability zones
and reduce the impact of the gel on water production. The environmental
factors affecting gel syneresis include formation temperature, divalent
metal-ion concentration, and pH of the formation aqueous solution.21 Therefore, gel syneresis has been the main factor
that limits the applications of hydrogels under this high temperature.

Recently, a novel gel system composed of AM, N,N′-methylenebisAM (BIS), and ammonium persulfate
((NH4)2S2O8) has been
applied to the water shut-off treatment. However, this gel system
loses thermal stability through gel syneresis in high-temperature
reservoirs. To improve the thermal stability of the gel system, the
syneresis mechanism must be understood for the gel system. Some studies
on the syneresis mechanism have been conducted for a HPAM/Cr3+ gel system.22−25 Experimental analysis on inorganic salts affects the hydrolysis
degree and suggests that the gel syneresis is the result of a decrease
in hydrogel hydrophilicity. Such hydrophilicity changes can be explained
by complexation of the carboxylate group with Ca2+ and
over cross-linking at elevated temperatures and salinities.

Relatively little research has been performed to demonstrate the
effect of the structural changes in polymers or cross-linker chains
on the gel syneresis. In addition, the HPAM/Cr3+ gel system
is formed via an ionic bond, whereas the AM/BIS gel system is polymerized
through the covalent double bond. Thus, the cross-linking mechanism
between the two gel systems is different, and this may lead to different
syneresis mechanisms for the two gel systems. Although the effect
of inorganic salts on polymer hydrolysis and gelation has been discussed
in previous publications,24,26 it is important to
study the effect of structural change on polymer and cross-linker
chains for gel syneresis at high temperatures. In this study, we investigated
the instability mechanism of the AM/BIS gel system. The data provide
a theoretical explanation for the gel syneresis, and this will be
used to optimize the gel system in profile modification treatments.

Results
and Discussion
Rupture of Linear PAM Chains
The
viscosity of the polymer
solution was highly correlated with the molecular weight of the polymer.28 This can be expressed via the following eq 1.29 Therefore, to investigate the effect of aging time on molecular
weight, the viscosity of the polymer as a function of aging time was
measured at different temperatures (Figure 1). The results showed that the viscosity
of the linear PAM solution decreases over time, and the elevated temperature
sharply decreases viscosity. Equation 1 implied that there was a positive correlation between
the viscosity and molecular weight. Because PAM prepared by AM and
(NH4)2S2O8 was linear,
the molecular weight was positively relative to the length of polymer
chain. Thus, viscosity degradation meant the reduction of molecular
weight, which result from breakage of the molecular chain of the polymer
at high temperatures.30 1  

Figure 1 Effect of temperature
on the viscosity of linear polyAM with increasing
aging time.

In the equation, M is the molecular weight of
the polymer and η is the intrinsic viscosity number.

To
study the mechanism of the chain scission, the energy-dispersive
system (EDS) spectrum of linear PAM was examined after aging for 12
h at 150 °C (Figure 2). From Figure 2a, it can be seen that the surface of the sample was flat and smooth
after syneresis, which suggests that the gel samples dehydrate uniformly
in the drying process. The energy-disperse spectrum of C, O, and N
elements was exhibited in Figure 2b. The results gave a percentage of C (50.69%), O (22.50%),
N (19.71%), and H (7.09%) in the PAM before hydrolysis and [C (50.00%),
O (44.40%), and H (5.59%)] after complete hydrolysis. The contents
of each element in the partially hydrolyzed PAM can be calculated
based on the percentage of reference element N obtained from EDS.
The content of each element obtained via EDS and theoretical calculation
are listed in Table 1. The carbon content obtained from both methods is close, whereas
the oxygen content obtained from EDS was much higher than theory.
We proposed that the dissolved oxygen was involved in the reaction
of the PAM backbone rupture suggesting that the polymer degradation
and viscosity loss might be because of oxidation at high temperatures.

The
rupture mechanism31,32 of the PAM backbone
was proposed and shown in Figure 3. The oxidation process can be divided into three phases.33 The first phase is radical initiation. The initiator
((NH4)2S2O8) reacts with
dissolved oxygen to generate peroxyl radicals. The oxidation reaction
was then initiated by the peroxyl radicals, which captures the active
α-H on the carbon next to the amide or carboxyl group. This
led to the formation of radicals on the polymer backbone (Figure 3a). The second phase
(Figure 3b) is propagation.
The polymer radicals reacted with oxygen and formed a peroxyl radical
on the polymer backbone, which propagated the chain reaction (Figure 3c). The hydroperoxyl
on the backbone weakened the C–C bond and broke the polymer
backbone producing short polymer chains (Figure 3d). At higher temperature, the chain reaction
was accelerated, and the rupture rates of the polymer chain were enhanced.
This result corresponds to the viscosity decline of the polymer solution
(as shown in Figure 1). Chain oxidation reaction will cease when the radical completed
the coupling reaction and the disproportionation reaction.33

of free radicals.

Hydrolysis of a Linear PAM Polymer
Oilfield brines
usually contain divalent cations such as Ca2+ and Mg2+. It has been widely accepted that the divalent metal cations
would bind to the carboxylic groups and decrease the viscosity and
hydrophilicity of the polymer and even lead to polymer precipitation.34 Thus, some experiments were conducted to investigate
the hydrolysis mechanism of linear PAM.35,36

Linear
PAM before and after hydrolysis were characterized by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The PAM showed three peaks before
aging (Figure 4). After
aging, two new peaks appeared at 45 and 182 ppm after the linear PAM
was aged for 12 h at 150 °C. The peak at 182 ppm is assigned
to the carbon in the carboxylate (COO–). This was
formed by hydrolysis of the amides, and the peak at 45 ppm corresponds
to the methine carbon (CH) attached to the carboxyl groups (−COO–). This suggested that the amide groups were partially
hydrolyzed and form carboxylic groups. FTIR further verified the hydrolysis
of PAM (Figure 5).
The stretching peaks of PAM at 1630, 2854, 2925, and 3441 cm–1 are assigned to O=C in −CONH2, CH2, CH3, and NH2, respectively. They remained
the same before and after aging. However, after aging, a new stretching
peak of PAM appeared at 1662 cm–1 and it was assigned
to the O=C in the −COO– groups. Therefore,
we confirmed that the hydrolysis reaction occurred after PAM was aged
at high temperatures.

aging

Figure 5 FTIR spectra of hydrogel cross-linked by BIS before and after aging
at 150 °C, respectively.

Deionized water was used to prepare the AM solution. There
should
be no metallic ions, and it should maintain a neutral pH. PAM hydrolysis
reactions favor alkaline or acidic conditions and the presence of
divalent cations such as Ca2+ and Mg2+. Under
neutral conditions, it is difficult for amide groups to interact with
water molecules and undergo hydrolysis.37 However, our experimental results suggest that PAM was hydrolyzed,
and ammonia was generated during the reaction. According to previous
reports,37 the additional water molecules,
ammonia molecules, protonated water, and protonated ammonia could
all reduce the activation energy and catalyze the amide hydrolysis
reaction. This adequately explains the PAM hydrolysis under neutral
conditions. The hydrolysis process of amide groups on PAM is shown
in Figure 6. The positively
protonated water can attack on carbonyl carbon of amide groups to
initiate the hydrolysis reaction, which would produce carboxylic acid
and release ammonia. The hydrolysis reaction would be retarded automatically
because of the neighboring group effect.38 Thus, the hydrolysis rate slowed with increasing degree of hydrolysis
(Figure 7). The value
of the hydrolysis degree was about 5–9% at different temperatures
and relatively low in the deionized water.

of PAM after aging 12 h at 150 °C.

Figure 7 Hydrolysis degree of hydrogel with aging time at different temperatures.

Rupture of Cros-slinker
Chains
The mobility of polymer
chains mainly depends on the cross-linking degree between polymer
and cross-linker. After PAM was cross-linked with different concentrations
of BIS, the states of the PAM chains can be divided into two categories,
that is, cross-linking chains and free chains. Protons in different
kinds of chains can be distinguished via NMR measurement with T2 relaxation time. This reflects the mobility
of the polymer chains (Figure 8). The cross-linking density can be defined as the percentage
of protons in the cross-linking chains relative to the protons in
the entire system. Therefore, the cross-linking degree can be measured
by solid-state NMR spectroscopy.39 The
relaxation time of cross-linked hydrogels before and after aging is
shown in Figure 9.
The cross-linking density of the hydrogel before and after aging was
obtained via MSE–CPMG analysis: 0.8643 and 0.5909, respectively.

time.

aging (a) and after
aging (b).

The effect of BIS concentration
and aging time on the cross-linking
density was investigated next (Figure 10). The cross-linking density decreased with
increasing aging time, which indicated that the cross-linking chain
was broken and more free PAM chains were formed. We note that a high
BIS concentration enhances the cross-linking degree and leads to better
thermal stability. The cross-linking density of the hydrogel decreases
to almost a stable level after aging for certain amounts of time,
despite the BIS concentration. This observation is consistent with
the hydrogel viscosity data after aging at 150 °C (Figure 11).

Figure 10 Effect of BIS concentration
on the cross-linking density of hydrogel
after aging.

Figure 11 Viscosity of cross-linked
hydrogel with aging time as a function
of BIS concentration.

Different types of functional groups in the hydrogel before
and
after aging were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) to investigate the mechanism underlying the decrease in the
cross-linking degree (Figure 12). The locations and contents of different groups in the XPS
C 1s spectrum are listed in Table 2 for PAM before and after aging, respectively. Figure 12a showed that the
XPS C 1s spectrum of the hydrogel sample before aging showed only
two peaks including 284.8 eV that was assigned to −C–C–
and 287.7 eV assigned to −CONH2. After the PAM was
aged for 12 h at 150 °C, the XPS C 1s spectrum changed (Figure 12b) with two new
peaks arising at 288.6 and 286 eV. These corresponded to COOH and
C–O, respectively.40 The COOH groups
were produced through hydrolysis of amide groups, and the other new
C–O group may be from the rupture of the cross-linker chains.

The two amide groups bound to the
mesomethylene carbon in BIS have
strong electronegativity, and thus the mesomethylene carbon is positively
charged, which may result in nucleophilic attack of the protonated
solvent on the mesomethylene carbon (Figure 13a). This nucleophilic attack facilitates
the rupture of the cross-linker chain. In addition, according to the
theoretical bond energy (Figure 14), the value of the C–N bond energy is the smallest
of the molecular structures. Therefore, after the C–N bond
was broken, one side produced C–OH and the other side produced
C–NH2. This explains the presence of the C–O
group. The second reason for the cross-linker fracture is the nucleophilic
attack on the carbonyl carbon to facilitate the cross-linker hydrolysis.
This hydrolysis reaction also leads to the rupture of the cross-linker
(Figure 13b).

Instability Mechanism of Hydrogel
Figure 15a shows that the viscosity
of the polymer declined rapidly in 10 to 20 min, and the hydrolysis
reaction then proceeded slowly until the hydrolysis degree reached
a stable value at 10 h. Because hydrolysis of amide groups was very
low in deionized water and it had little effect on the polymer viscosity,
the rupture of polymer chains caused most to the polymer degradation.
The hydrogel still had a high viscosity even after aging for 20 min
at 150 °C. This resulted from the cross-linked network. Therefore,
the polymer chains were first disrupted and then the cross-linker
chains began breaking at high temperatures. This suggested that the
cross-linker chains might play a more important role in the thermal
stability of the gel and explains some work into antihigh-temperature
gels such as PEI gel and PBIS gel.

Next, the distribution
of special charge was analyzed using ChemOffice
to investigate the stability of the chemical bond in the hydrogel.
The charge distribution of each atom and relative bond lengths were
calculated under steric configuration of stable MM2 energy (Table 3). The carbon of the
amide group (C18) has the highest positive charge (0.457). Thus, C18
was the easiest to attack by protonated water, which explains why
the polymer was broken first. Carbon C6 (0.406) has a secondary positive
charge, and thus the cross-linker hydrolysis occurs next. The C(9)–N(8)
bond between methylene carbon and nitrogen has the weakest bond energy
and the longest bond length (1.466 Å). Furthermore, the methylene
carbon (C9) has a certain positive charge (0.098). Therefore, the
methylene carbon was easily attacked by the protonated water, which
was responsible for the rupture of the cross-linker chains.

These experiments show that the loss of gel stability
is due to
rupture of polymer chains and rupture of cross-linker chains. According
to previous studies, the behavior of water including the hydrogel
can be summarized into three states: nonfreezing bound water, freezable
bound water, and free water.41−43 Nonfreezing bound water is strongly
bound to the hydrogel network, whereas freezable bound water is weakly
bound to the hydrogel network. The freezable water easily transforms
into free water. The rupture of polymer and cross-linker chains can
disrupt the three-dimensional network structure and cause rigidity
loss. This decreases the ability of the gel to bind the aqueous molecules.
The resulting freezable bound water would separate from the gel phase
and become the aqueous phase (Figure 16). With increasing aging time, the volume of the gel
would shrink. Finally, the gel that has shrunk would float in the
aqueous phase and reduce the ability to control water.

of hydrogel instability at high temperature.

Conclusions
A hydrogel system composed of AM, BIS,
and ammonium persulfate
was prepared. The instability mechanism of the hydrogel was studied
at elevated temperatures. Although the amide groups on the polymer
chains hydrolyzed at high temperatures, the degree of hydrolysis was
too small to affect gel instability. The results suggested that if
the gelant solutions were prepared with deionized water, then the
rupture of both polymer chains and cross-linker chains were the main
causes for gel instability. The polymer backbone was broken because
of the oxidation reaction involving free radicals. The rupture of
the cross-linker chains was due to hydrolysis of the carbonyl carbon
of the amide group, followed by attack on the methylene carbon from
the nucleophilic aqueous solution. The rupture of both polymer and
cross-linker chains disrupts the network structure and makes the bound
water separate from the gel phase. This further decreases the hydrogel
function. Besides, the cross-linker chains might play an important
role in the thermal stability of the gel. This explains some work
in high-temperature-resistant gels. Understanding of chemical principles
related to the hydrogel instability mechanism is of great significance
for the optimization of the polymer and the cross-linker, especially
for applications of hydrogels under high-temperature reservoirs.

Experimental
Section
Materials
AM was provided by JiangXi ChangJiu Biochemical
Industry Co., Ltd., and BIS was used as the cross-linking agent. Ammonium
persulfate ((NH4)2S2O8) was analytically pure and was purchased from Aladdin Reagent CO.,
Ltd. (Shanghai, China). AM (5.00 g) and 0.02 g of (NH4)2S2O8 were dissolved in 95.00 g of deionized
water to prepare the linear PAM solution. If 0.02 g of (NH4)2S2O8 was added into the above
solution, the hydrogel would be prepared. The cross-linking process
is shown in Figure 17. The reaction was carried out at 60 °C for 1.5 h. Deionized
water was used in the experiments unless otherwise mentioned.

Figure 17 Proposed
mechanism of cross-linking AM with BIS.

Measurements of Polymer Viscosity
The resulting PAM
solutions were sealed in steel cans and placed in an oven at different
temperatures for different lengths of time. The viscosity of the samples
after aging was measured at 25 °C with a rotation speed of 6
RPM using the NDJ-1 rotational viscometer.

Measurements of NMR
The solid hydrogel materials (Figure 18) were precipitated
from an aqueous solution with the addition of acetone. The products
were washed with methyl alcohol and dried with a vacuum drying oven
for 72 h before measurement. The sample was dissolved in D2O and 1,4-dioxane served as the reference. The molecular structure
characterizations of the samples were examined with 13C
and 1H NMR spectra on a Bruker AV II-400 spectrometer.

Figure 18 Dry
solid materials precipitated from hydrogel after aging for
different times.

The cross-linking degree
was measured with a VTMR20-010V-T spectrometer.
The resonance frequency was 21.5556 MHz, and the intensity of the
magnets was 0.5 T. The coil diameter was 10 mm, and the temperature
of the magnets was 32 °C. The A Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill
(CPMG) pulse sequence was used to measure the T2 spectra.27 The decay curve of the sample was obtained with
software and the MSE-CPMG sequence. All NMR experiments were performed
at room temperature. The spectra were processed and analyzed using
a Bruker Topspin V2.0.

Measurements of FTIR
After the precipitated
solid hydrogel
materials were washed with methyl alcohol and dried in a vacuum oven
for 72 h, the IR samples were prepared by mixing the hydrogel and
KBr powder and pressing it into a disk. The FTIR measurements were
conducted on a Nexus 670 FT-IR spectrometer, and the spectral measurements
were collected from 4000 to 500 cm–1. All treated
and untreated samples were then dried and coated with a gold coating
before SEM–EDS examination.

SEM and EDS Measurements
SEM–EDS (X-Max 51-XMX0019)
was used to observe the morphology and surface texture of the polymer
as well as to analyze the elemental composition of the polymer. Determinations
were conducted at an accelerating voltage of 25 kV and a working distance
from 5 mm to 10 mm.

XPS Measurements
X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy data
were obtained with a Kratos XSAM800 electron spectrometer using nonmonochromatized
Al Kα (1486.6 eV) X-radiation. The operating conditions were
set to 12 kV and 15 mA. High-resolution spectra of carbon were recorded.
Peak positions were corrected by calibration against C 1 s occurring
at 284.8 eV for this spectrometer. Curve fitting and decomposition
were completed assuming Gaussian–Lorentzian fitting following
a Shirley background subtraction.
