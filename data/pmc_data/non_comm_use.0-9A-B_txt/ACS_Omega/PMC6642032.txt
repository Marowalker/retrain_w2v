Near-infrared spectroscopy
(NIRS) is a rapid detection technique
that has been used to characterize biomass. The objective of this
study was to develop suitable NIRS models to predict the acetic acid,
furfural, and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) contents in biomass hydrolysates.
Using a uniform distribution of pretreatment conditions, 60 representative
biomass hydrolysates were prepared. Partial least-squares regression
was used to develop models capable of predicting acetic acid, furfural,
and HMF contents. Optimal models were built using the wavenumber range
of 9000–8000 and 7000–5000 cm–1 with
high R2 for calibration and validation
models, small root-mean-square error of calibration (<0.21) and
root-mean-square error of prediction (RMSEP, <0.42), and a ratio
of the standard deviation of the reference values to the RMSEP of
>2.7. The NIRS method largely reduced the analytical time from
∼55
to <1 min and has no cost for reagents.

1 Introduction
Developing low-cost and
highly efficient alternative renewable
energy to ease our energy resource challenges and air pollution is
a common goal for researchers working in the field of energy. Bioethanol
derived from biomass is a desirable alternative to conventional petroleum-based
fossil fuels and has received widespread attention.1,2 Although
starch-based crops, such as corn, sorghum, and wheat, have a high
ethanol titer and yield, their annual supply for ethanol production
is quite finite because of the competition with human food and animal
feed.3 The biofuel sector has been struggling
to overcome the “food vs fuel” controversy due to the
limited natural resources, particularly the limited productive agricultural
lands and usable freshwater. Thus, nonfood lignocellulosic biomass,
such as corn stover, switchgrass, sorghum stalks, miscanthus, big
bluestem, and agricultural residues, provides a potentially valuable
resource to produce ethanol because of its renewability and availability
at low cost.4,5 Unlike that of starch-based crops,
however, the use of lignocellulosic biomass for ethanol production
only through saccharification and fermentation is not feasible under
current technical conditions because of its complex nature.6,7 Pretreatment is an essential step to disrupt biomass microstructures
and cleave the chemical linkages among cellulose, hemicellulose, and
lignin, which are three major components of lignocellulosic biomass.5,8

In recent years, a variety of pretreatment methods for lignocellulosic
biomass have been proposed, but most of them are still in the laboratory-scale
exploration stage and only very few have been applied in the bioethanol
industry. At present, the liquid hot water pretreatment method has
also received much attention because of zero chemical use in the pretreatment
process, as compared with the industrialized dilute sulfuric acid
pretreatment method.9−11 High-temperature treatment is employed in both methods.
High-temperature acid pretreatment causes the chemical structures
of biomass to be disrupted and release monosaccharides; however, it
also causes the degradation of sugar monomers to furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural
(HMF). The acetic group on hemicellulose branches is released during
pretreatment and acidizes the biomass slurry, which also causes the
degradation of sugar to furfural and HMF.12 Furfural is obtained from pentose degradation and HMF from hexose
degradation.13,14 The formation of furfural and
HMF causes fermentable sugar loss and inhibits the downstream enzyme
and yeast activities especially at high solid loading hydrolysis and
fermentation, thus lowering the final ethanol yield.15 Therefore, it is necessary to determine the concentrations
of furfural, HMF, and acetic acid in treated biomass hydrolysates
(Tables 1 and 2).

Currently,
the most common method for furfural, HMF, and acetic
acid detection in biomass hydrolysates is the high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) method recommended by the National Renewable
Energy Laboratory (NREL). The HPLC method uses an organic acid column
and a universal refractive index detector (RID) as the separation
and detection units, respectively, with a running time up to 50–55
min.16 Subsequently, some other methods17−22 based on liquid and gas chromatography and mass spectrometry techniques
have been proposed. These methods are time-consuming and expensive
and also require skilled operators. Thus, it is essential to develop
a rapid and low-cost detection method for furfural, HMF, and acetic
acid in biomass hydrolysates. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is
a widely investigated analytical tool and has been applied in quality
control and process monitoring of food, pharmaceutical, and agricultural
industries because of the advantages of being nondestructive; thus,
samples can be reused, requiring no reagents that can harm the sample
or the environment, short detection time, and low detection cost over
the traditional laboratory methods.23−27 Xu et al.28 developed
NIRS prediction models for sugar contents in corn stover hydrolysates
with the coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.89, the root-mean-square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 1.08
g/L, and the ratio of the standard deviation (SD) of reference data
to RMSEP (RPD) of 2.76 for glucose; R2 of 0.83, RMSEP of 1.60 g/L, and RPD of 2.23 for xylose; and R2 of 0.75, RMSEP of 0.53 g/L, and RPD of 1.51
for arabinose. Some NIRS models have also been developed for the prediction
of structural sugars, lignin, and extractives in biomass and are very
useful as a screening tool to select desirable strains from numerous
blind samples.29−34 Also, some NIRS models have been developed to predict the heating
value, elemental compositions, and moisture and ash contents of biomass
with satisfactory R2 and RMSEP.35−37

To date, no study has investigated the potential of NIRS spectroscopy
to predict the contents of furfural, HMF, and acetic acid in biomass
hydrolysates. Thus, the objective of this work was to develop a rapid
and low-cost quantitative method using NIRS spectroscopy for the determination
of furfural, HMF, and acetic acid in biomass hydrolysates.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Biomass Hydrolysates and
Sample Summary
The contents of acetic acid, furfural, and
HMF in 60 biomass hydrolysate
samples determined by the HPLC method are listed in Table 3. Acetic acid, furfural, and
HMF contents ranged from 1.58 to 5.00, 0.26 to 8.47, and 0.06 to 2.67
mg/mL with SDs of 0.90, 2.21, and 0.68, respectively. In the calibration
set, acetic acid, furfural, and HMF contents ranged from 1.64 to 5.00,
0.26 to 8.47, and 0.06 to 2.67 mg/mL with SDs of 0.87, 2.32, and 0.75,
respectively. In the validation set, acetic acid, furfural, and HMF
contents ranged from 1.58 to 4.89, 0.70 to 7.02, and 0.07 to 1.77
mg/mL with SDs of 1.15, 2.18, and 0.56, respectively. The ranges,
means, and SDs of acetic acid, furfural, and HMF contents in the calibration
set covered those in the validation set, and both subsets showed consistent
distributions, which are desired for model construction.

2.2 Biomass
Hydrolysate Near-Infrared Spectra
The NIR spectra of 60 biomass
hydrolysate samples with the full
range of 10 000–4000 cm–1 are shown
in Figure 1. The main
absorbance regions were observed in the wavenumber ranges of 9000–8000,
7200–6200, and 5500–4000 cm–1, which
represent the overlap of several C–H second overtones, the
O–H first stretch of H2O, and the overlap of several
C–H first stretch overtones, respectively.28,38

2.3 NIR Model Development
The full range
(10 000–4000 cm–1) of NIR spectra
was first investigated for model development of acetic acid, furfural,
and HMF contents. The regression coefficients (Figure 2) showed spikes around the very strong absorbance
caused by O–H overtones around 7200 and 5400 cm–1, and wavenumber ranges of less than 5000 cm–1 and
more than 9000 cm–1 did not have large contribution
to model development. Thus, these regions were excluded from some
subsequent models. Three reduced wavenumber ranges (9000–5000;
9000–8000 and 7000–5000; and 7000–5000) of NIR
spectra were used to optimize the prediction model performance. The
results are shown in Table 4.

2.3.1 Acetic Acid
From the results shown
in Table 4, the model
developed using the full wavenumber range (10 000–4000
cm–1) of spectra for acetic acid in the calibration
set had an R2 (cal.) of 0.90, RMSEC of
0.27, RPD of 2.5, and R2 (val.) of 0.81.
The reduced wavenumber range 1 (9000–5000 cm–1) increased the R2 (val.) of the model
from 0.81 to 0.90 but R2 (cal.) decreased
from 0.90 to 0.67 because of the decreasing number of factors used
for calibration. Although the model with the reduced wavenumber range
3 (7000–5000 cm–1) had a high R2 (cal.) of 0.94 and a low RMSEC of 0.22, the excessive
reduction of the wavenumber range resulted in the partial loss of
key information of acetic acid when compared with the full wavenumber
range, causing the decrease of R2 (val.)
from 0.81 to 0.73 and the increase of RMSEP from 0.46 to 0.56. Thus,
the model using the reduced wavenumber range 3 did not show a good
prediction ability for acetic acid contents. On the basis of the previously
mentioned analysis, a reduced wavenumber range 2 (9000–8000
and 7000–5000 cm–1) was generated by further
compressing the reduced range 1 and extending the reduced range 3.
The wavenumber range of 8000–7000 cm–1 was
excluded because it was mainly attributed to sugars and it contains
noise caused by the very strong absorbance of the O–H overtone.28 Results showed that the model with the reduced
wavenumber range 2 had the best calibration and prediction performance
with an R2 (cal.) of 0.96, R2 (val.) of 0.85, RMSEC of 0.18, RMSEP of 0.43, and RPD
of 2.7.

2.3.2 Furfural
The full wavenumber range
was first used to develop the model of furfural, and the results are
listed in Table 4.
The first model of furfural showed an R2 (cal.) of 0.99, R2 (val.) of 0.97, RMSEC
of 0.22, RMSEP of 0.54, and RPD of 4.1, indicating a fair prediction
performance for furfural contents. Also, as the wavenumber range used
to develop the model of furfural was reduced from the full range to
reduced ranges 1 and 2, both R2 (cal.)
and R2 (val.) further increased as well
as RPD and both RMSEC and RMSEP further decreased as well as the number
of factors used, demonstrating that the optimization of the wavenumber
range further improved the prediction model performance for furfural
contents. However, when the reduced range 2 was further compressed
to the reduced range 3, neither R2 (cal.)
nor R2 (val.) increased, RMSEP increased,
and RPD decreased, indicating that the excessive reduction of the
wavenumber range also caused the partial loss of key information of
furfural when compared with the other models that used reduced wavenumber
ranges. Thus, the model developed on wavenumber range 2 was chosen
to predict the contents of furfural.

2.3.3 HMF
The full wavenumber range was
used to develop the model to predict HMF, and the results are listed
in Table 4. The first
model of HMF showed an R2 (cal.) of 0.87, R2 (val.) of 0.93, RMSEC of 0.24, RMSEP of 0.19,
and RPD of 3.0. The model performances, especially the calibration
performance, of HMF were not as good as those of furfural. From the
models developed using the reduced wavenumber ranges, results were
generally similar to those from the full wavenumber model with no
model showing consistent improvement over the full model. The reduced
wavenumber range 2 model did have slightly better R2 (val.) and was chosen as the best model.

On the
basis of the previously mentioned analysis, the reduced wavenumber
range 2 (9000–8000 and 7000–5000 cm–1) was finally employed to develop the prediction models for acetic
acid, furfural, and HMF contents. Spectrum outlier diagnostics showed
that the distances of all data points were less than 3.0 (data not
shown) and suggested that no outlier existed in the spectra of samples. Figure 3 shows the plot of
predicted versus actual values in the optimized model with good correlation
coefficients of 0.98 (cal.) and 0.92 (val.) for acetic acid, 0.99
(cal.) and 0.99 (val.) for furfural, and 0.95 (cal.) and 0.97 (val.)
for HMF. Figure 3 also
shows that predicted versus actual contents of acetic acid, furfural,
and HMF were randomly distributed, further confirming the good performance
of the prediction models.

actual acetic acid

3 Conclusions
The
NIRS prediction models for rapid and accurate analysis of acetic
acid, furfural, and HMF contents in biomass hydrolysates were developed
successfully, which shows that this can be a simple and rapid method
for the industrial application of ethanol production. The model optimized
on the reduced range 2 (9000–8000 and 7000–5000 cm–1) generally had a better overall performance for the
prediction of acetic acid, furfural, and HMF contents than that of the model developed on the full wavenumber
range (10 000–4000 cm–1) in terms
of R2 (cal.), R2 (val.), RMSEC, RMSEP, and RPD. The NIR method can predict acetic
acid, furfural, and HMF in biomass hydrolysates in <1 min and has
no cost for reagents.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals and Materials
Furfural
(purity > 98%) and HMF (purity > 97%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO). Ultrapure water (HPLC grade), acetic acid (HPLC grade),
and sulfuric acid were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific Chemicals
Inc. (Ward Hill, MA). Corn stover, switchgrass, sorghum, and miscanthus
were harvested from the Kansas State University Research Farm (Manhattan,
KS). After harvest, biomass samples were air-dried at 60 °C for
at least 1 week, ground to <1 mm particle size using a SM 2000
cutting mill (Retsch Inc. Newton, PA) and then sealed in plastic bags
with zippers and stored at room temperature before use.

4.2 Biomass Pretreatment and Biomass Hydrolysate
Collection
Five grams of ground biomass with 50 mL of distilled
water or dilute sulfuric acid solution was weighed into a 75 mL stainless
steel reactor (Swagelok, Kansas City Valve & Fitting Co., KS)
made of 316L stainless steel with a measured internal volume of 75
mL (outside diameter of 38.1 mm, length of 125 mm, and wall thickness
of 2.4 mm). When the sand bath (Techne, Inc., Princeton, NJ) reached
a designated temperature (Table 1), the reactor was submerged into the sand bath for
different reaction times (Table 1). Once the reaction time was complete, the reactor
was submerged in ice water to quench the hydrolysis reaction. Biomass
slurry was filtrated to collect biomass hydrolysates (liquid fraction
of biomass slurry). After that, the biomass hydrolysate was placed
in a freezer until analysis. The biomass residue was washed with 100
mL of distilled water to remove degradation products attached on the
surface of the biomass residue and then dried at 45 °C for 24
h in preparation for further analysis. Four types of biomass (corn
stover, switchgrass, sorghum, and miscanthus) were used in this experiment. Table 2 shows their chemical
compositions measured by the NREL standard procedure.39 Cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, ash, extractives, and
moisture contents ranged from 30.61 to 34.63, 24.04 to 28.81, 11.33
to 16.97, 0.77 to 1.61, 15.14 to 27.22, and 3.07 to 4.14%, respectively.
To reduce prediction biases and limits of the NIRS prediction models,
a wide range of biomass hydrolysate samples were prepared with different
pretreatment conditions (Table 1). The ranges of temperature, time, and acid concentration
were 120–230 °C, 10–60 min, and 0–5%, respectively.
After pretreatment, 60 biomass hydrolysate samples were collected
by vacuum filtration for both HPLC and NIRS measurements.

4.3 HPLC Analysis of Furfural, HMF, and Acetic
Acid
Furfural, HMF, and acetic acid in biomass hydrolysates
were determined by the NREL method “Determination of Sugars,
Byproducts, and Degradation Products in Liquid Fraction Process Samples”.
The HPLC spectra were recorded with a G1362A refractive index detector
(RID) (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) and an Aminex HPX-87H ion exchange
column (7.8 × 300 mm, Bio-Rad). The injection volume for each
of the samples was 20 μL; the mobile phase was 0.005 M sulfuric
acid water with a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min; and the column oven and
RID were set at 60 and 45 °C, respectively. The mobile phase
was degassed for 15 min by a P250D ultrasonic apparatus (ETL testing
laboratories, Inc., Cortland, NY) before use. Compounds were identified
by comparing their retention times to those of standards. Data were
acquired and processed using OpenLAB CDS C.01.05 ChemStation (Agilent,
Santa Clara, CA).

4.4 NIR Scans of Biomass Hydrolysates
The NIR spectra of biomass hydrolysates were recorded in absorbance
mode using an Antaris II FT-NIR analyzer with an automated transmission
sampling module (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Madison, WI). A total
of 1.2 mL of each biomass hydrolysate was loaded into a 2 mL round
sample tube used for the NIR measurement of liquid samples with air
as the blank. A blank scan was performed before each sample was scanned.
No delay time was set before both blank and sample scans. The spectra
of each sample were averaged with 16 scans at a resolution of 8 cm–1 in the wavenumber range of 10 000–4000
cm–1. Attenuator and gain were set at B screen (attenuate
6–10% of incident light transmitted) and 8 times, respectively,
using the automatic optimization function of the FT-NIR instrument
to analyze the representative biomass hydrolysate. The aperture was
used to focus the light beam to completely pass through each sample.

4.5 Spectral Processing and Chemometric Analysis
Both spectral processing and chemometric analysis were performed
by TQ Analyst 8.6.12 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Madison,
WI). The path length type was set at constant on the basis of the
fact that sample cells have a fixed path length and biomass hydrolysates
are homogeneous liquids. To reduce the random noise and improve the
signal-to-noise ratio and the model robustness, Savitzky–Golay
smoothing was used to reduce the noise of the original NIR spectra.5 In addition, the wavenumber range of the NIR
spectra was reduced to improve the performance of prediction models.

A total of 60 biomass hydrolysates were sequenced in a descending
order according to the measured value of furfural. One in every six
samples was assigned randomly to the validation set with a total of
10 samples, and the remaining 50 samples were used for the calibration
set to develop prediction models. The full wavenumber range from 10 000
to 4000 cm–1 was used unless otherwise specified.
A partial least-squares (PLSs) regression was used to obtain the relationship
between the reference and NIR spectra.

Prediction models were
evaluated according to the R2 and RPD
values. R2 values
in the range of 0.50–0.65, 0.66–0.81, 0.82–0.90,
and 0.91–1.00 indicated that models were adequate, fair, good,
and excellent, respectively.40 The RPD
considers the effect of both RMSEP and data variation. The values
of RPD of <2.3, 2.4–3.0, 3.1–4.9, 5–6.4, and
6.5–8.0 and >8.0 indicated very poor, poor, fair, good,
very
good, and excellent prediction of the model developed, respectively.41 To reduce the possibility of overfitting caused
by the addition of excess factors to reach a minimum prediction error,
the prediction residual error sum of squares was used to select the
optimal number of factors for the model calibration. The Chauvenet
test was also used to eliminate outliers defined as the points at
distances in the principal component space greater than 3.0.
