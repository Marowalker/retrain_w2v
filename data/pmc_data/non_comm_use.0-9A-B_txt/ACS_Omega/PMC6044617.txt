The
uniqueness of Doxil can be attributed, to a large extent, to
its intraliposomal doxorubicin-sulfate nanorod crystal. We re-examine
these nanocrystal features and their mechanism of the formation by
studying pegylated liposomal doxorubicins (PLDs) of the same lipid
composition, size distribution, and extraliposome medium that were
prepared at different ammonium sulfate (AS) concentrations. This study
includes a comparison of the thermotropic behavior, morphology, and
in vitro ammonia-induced doxorubicin release (relevant to Doxil’s
in vivo performance) of these PLDs. In this study, we confirm that
a transmembrane ammonium gradient is critical for doxorubicin remote
loading, and we demonstrate that the intraliposomal concentration
of sulfate counteranions and ammonium ions determine to a large extent
the physical state and stability of the PLDs’ remote loaded
doxorubicin. “Fully-developed” intraliposome doxorubicin-sulfate
nanorod crystals (as defined by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy
imaging) develop only when the ammonium sulfate (AS) concentration
used for PLD preparation is ≥150 mM. Less than 10% of PLDs
prepared with 100 mM AS show fully developed nanorod crystals. Intraliposomal
AS concentration ≥200 mM is required to support the stable
nanocrystallization in PLDs. The presence of nanocrystals and their
melting enthalpy and phase transition co-operativity strongly affect
the ammonia-induced doxorubicin release of PLDs. A quick, biphasic
release occurs for PLDs that lack the nanorod crystals or have crystals
of poor crystallinity, whereas PLDs prepared with ≥200 mM AS
show a monophasic, zero-order slow release. This study also demonstrates
that after remote loading, residual intraliposomal ammonium concentration
and the transmembrane pH gradient related to it also play an important
role in doxorubicin-sulfate intraliposomal crystallization and ammonia-induced
doxorubicin release.

==== Body
Introduction
Doxil (pegylated liposomal
doxorubicin, (PLD)) is the first FDA-approved
nanodrug (1995).1 It is based on two concepts:
(i) the prolonged circulation time afforded by poly(ethylene glycol)
(PEG) corona on the nanoliposomes’ surface by 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(poly(ethylene
glycol))-2000] (DSPE-PEG2k) lipopolymer2,3 and (ii) the
transmembrane ammonium sulfate (AS) gradient ([AS]liposome ≫ [AS]medium4,5) that enables the highly
efficient and stable remote loading of doxorubicin required for human
treatment (∼50 mg/m2).1,4,5 This remote loading also not only plays a role in
achieving high encapsulation and retention of doxorubicin during long-term
storage and blood circulation after injection but also simultaneously
allows for the ammonium-induced drug release at the tumor site. This
release is induced by ammonia, which is continuously produced in tumors
due to the unique tumor metabolic pathway, glutaminolysis.6

For Doxil, the well-established remote
loading mechanism is based
on continuous “escape” (efflux) of ammonia gas (formed
by the pH-dependent dissociation of the intraliposomal NH4+ to neutral ammonia plus a proton), which creates a transmembrane
pH gradient (pHliposome ≪ pHmedium).1,5 The unionized doxorubicin that diffuses from the medium to the intraliposomal
aqueous phase along the gradient becomes protonated and forms intraliposome-insoluble
doxorubicin-sulfate (dox-sulfate) salt. Consumption of extra protons
by doxorubicin elevates the intraliposomal pH and renews the dissociation
of NH4+ to NH3 and H+,
enabling the continuation of the loading cycle until all of the doxorubicin
in the medium is exchanged with NH4+. When the
intraliposome doxorubicin concentrations are increased, the dox-sulfate-insoluble
salt assembles into nanorod crystals.1,5 Namely, the
transmembrane ammonium gradient serves as the “driving force”
for triggering the cycle in which doxorubicin is almost entirely remotely
and stably loaded into PLDs, mostly in the form of dox-sulfate nanorod
crystals.1,4,5,7

In the past studies, we demonstrated by cryogenic
transmission
electron microscopy (cryo-TEM)4 and X-ray
diffraction (XRD)4,8 the crucial role of sulfate counteranion
in the formation of dox-sulfate nanocrystals. However, the actual
impact of intraliposome ammonium and sulfate ion concentrations on
the formation and properties of these intraliposomal nanocrystals,
as well as on the functional performance of PLDs, remained unclear.
The present study is aimed to fill in this gap. Recently, we reported
the application of “high-sensitivity” differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC) in the physicochemical characterization of liposomal
nanodrugs, such as Doxil, and showed, for the first time, the thermotropic
behavior of intraliposome dox-sulfate rod nanocrystals in Doxil treatment.9 Following the heating scan, Doxil exhibits two
distinct endotherms attributed to the phase transition of membrane
lipids at ∼52 °C and the melting of intraliposomal dox-sulfate
nanorod crystals at ∼70 °C. Both phase transitions are
reversible. Recently, we achieved a high-resolution structure of Doxil’s
membrane and its dox-sulfate nanorod crystals using XRD.10 We also developed a functional in vitro doxorubicin
release assay.6

In this study, we
combine high-sensitivity DSC with structural
characterization by cryo-TEM11 and the
functional in vitro ammonia induced doxorubicin release assay to re-examine
the independent role of ammonium and sulfate ions in the formation
and properties of dox-sulfate nanocrystals in PLDs. We also studied
how the nanocrystals’ properties affect the PLDs’ ammonia-induced
doxorubicin release profiles in vitro. Our results strongly suggest
that the individual concentration of each of these two ions, ammonium
and sulfate, and their mole ratio play a very important role in Doxil’s
unique stable loading and its ammonia-triggered release. These results
shed new light on the remote-loading mechanism driven by the transmembrane
ammonium gradient employed in the design and optimization of other
remotely loaded liposomal nanodrugs.

Results and Discussion
This study focuses on the role of ammonium and sulfate ions used
in the remote loading of doxorubicin and in the formation and properties
of the intraliposomal dox-sulfate nanorod crystals in PLDs. To better
understand and quantify the interaction between doxorubicin and sulfate
in the intraliposomal aqueous phase, we first studied the effect of
ammonium and sulfate ions on the doxorubicin precipitation in bulk
aqueous solutions mimicking the pH and ionic strength of the intraliposomal
aqueous phase. Next, we studied the doxorubicin sulfate nanocrystal
formation inside PLDs using two different groups of “transmembrane
ammonium gradients”. In the first group, AS solutions in different
concentrations with the ammonium-to-sulfate mole ratio fixed at 2:1
were used; in the second group, AS mixed with either sodium sulfate
(SS) or ammonium chloride solutions were used to study the effect
of the “mole” ratio of ammonium-to-sulfate on nanocrystal
formation. The morphology features of the resulting PLDs and intraliposomal
nanocrystals were characterized by cryo-TEM,11 and their thermotropic behaviors were studied by high-sensitivity
DSC.9 We studied the effects of the above
properties on the liposome performance (as expressed by ammonia-induced
doxorubicin release kinetics) to better understand all of the aspects
of ammonium and sulfate ion involvement.

Precipitation Titration
of Doxorubicin and Ammonium Sulfate
or Sodium Sulfate
Doxorubicin self-aggregation is a well-established
phenomenon.12 It is thermodynamically driven
by stacking of the planner aromatic rings of doxorubicin. High ionic
strength levels in the medium facilitate self-aggregation. Doxorubicin
dimers are observed at a concentration of as low as 1 μM, whereas
large aggregates are formed at higher concentrations.12 In this study, we followed the formation of large dox-sulfate
aggregates in the sulfate solutions (AS or sodium sulfate) by precipitation
titration and used the turbidity visible to the naked eye as the endpoint
of titration. For the most part, the titration curves of AS and sodium
sulfate (Figure 1a)
almost overlap, suggesting that sulfate ion concentration is the main
factor in the precipitation, whereas the cationic ion (ammonium or
sodium) has no or only negligible effect. In Figure 1b–d, the linear curves for the ammonium
sulfate solutions in all of the three concentrations were of very
similar slopes. The calculated Ksp (solubility
product) of doxorubicin sulfate (Ksp =
[Dox+]2[SO42–])
is ∼1.1 × 10–7 M3 similar
to the values previously reported.7,13

Effect of Intraliposomal
Ammonium and Sulfate Concentrations
on the Encapsulation Efficiency of PLDs
All of the blank
small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) (pegylated nanoliposomes before
doxorubicin loading) and the related PLDs used in this study were
of identical lipid composition and similar size (Table 1, data not shown for blank SUVs).
All of the PLDs were of 16 mg/mL total lipids and 2 mg/mL total doxorubicin.
All of the PLDs used in this study had a similar diameter in the range
of 75–85 nm (with polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.05–0.07).
Remote loading did not significantly change the size distribution
as measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS). The mole ratio of doxorubicin
to lipid used in the remote loading was maintained at 0.16. The PLDs
prepared with an AS concentration of ≥200 mM achieved an encapsulation
efficiency of almost 100%. Only the PLDs prepared with 150 mM AS and
the mixture of AS with ammonium chloride showed a loading efficiency
below 90% (Table 1).

Effect of Intraliposome Ammonium and Sulfate
Concentrations
on the Thermotropic Behavior and Morphology of Blank Liposomes and
PLDs
The effect of intraliposomal ammonium and sulfate concentrations
on the thermotropic behavior of blank SUVs was characterized (Figure S1, Supporting Information). All of the
blank liposomes show similar thermograms having only a membrane lipid
endotherm phase transition at ∼53 °C with low enthalpy
(∼1–1.5 kcal/mol) and poor co-operativity (ΔT1/2 of ∼13 °C, Table S1, Supporting Information), similar to what we have
recently demonstrated for cholesterol-rich (∼38 mol %) hydrogenated
soybean phosphatidylcholine (HSPC)/cholesterol SUV membrane.9

Remote loading of doxorubicin had a marked
impact on PLD morphology as imaged by cryo-TEM (Figure 2). Morphology of the blank liposomes and
the PLDs was determined by their aspect ratio (the measured major
axis divided by the measured minor axis). Several hundreds of liposomes
were measured for each analysis (resolution limit = 2 nm, Table 2). An aspect ratio
of 1.06 was set as the threshold at which PLDs change from spherical
to ellipsoid. All of the blank liposomes are spherical (as exemplified
in Figure 2a for blank
liposomes prepared with 250 mM AS), with the PLD aspect ratio dependent
on the AS concentration used for their preparation. PLDs prepared
with 100 mM AS retained a spherical shape (Figure 2b). Most PLDs prepared with 100 mM AS lack
obvious nanocrystals, although some did contain nanocrystals with
low electron density displaying lower contrast in the cryo-TEM images
(Figure 2b); hence,
we subsequently refer to these nanocrystals as being not “fully
developed”. Conversely, nanorod crystals that are clearly imaged
due to their high electron density and hence higher contrast in the
cryo-TEM images (Figure 2c–f and Table 2) are defined as fully developed.

c Cryo-TEM images did not display
sufficient contrast to obtain enough PLDs for the manual measurement.

As the AS concentration is
increased to 150 mM, PLDs begin to show
a mixed morphology of spherical and ellipsoid shapes (Figure 2c); when the PLDs are prepared
at 200 and 250 mM, they become mostly ellipsoid (Figure 2d–f and Table 2). At the same time, nanorod
crystals defined as fully developed were observed in most (≥90%)
of the PLDs when the AS concentration used for PLD preparation was
≥150 mM (Figure 2c–f and Table 2). We therefore regard this concentration as the threshold for the
formation of PLDs with fully developed intraliposomal dox-sulfate
nanocrystals. All of the intraliposomal nanorod crystals in the PLDs
that display fully developed intraliposomal nanorod crystals share
a similar diameter of 21 ± 2 nm, whereas crystal length varied
according to the long axis of the ellipsoid PLDs. The results are
in a agreement with the previous X-ray diffraction measurement data10 (nanocrystal diameter of 17.6 ± 2.1 nm).
The lack of effect of AS concentration on nanocrystal diameter strongly
suggests that the diameter of the nanocrystal is determined to a large
extent by the drug-to-lipid ratio used for the remote loading, as
long as the ammonium gradient enables >90% encapsulation and there
is sufficient sulfate to induce complete crystallization of all of
the intraliposomal doxorubicin.

PLDs prepared with 300 mM AS
keep their spherical shape in spite
of the prevalent presence of intraliposomal nanocrystals (Table 2). Although the intraliposomal
nanocrystals show similar morphology under cryo-TEM to those in the
PLDs prepared with 150, 200, and 250 mM AS concentrations, they did
show a distinctly higher melting enthalpy (as shown in Table 3). This suggests that the nanocrystals
formed in PLDs prepared with 300 mM AS are arranged in a tighter structure,
and hence more doxorubicin is packed in the same crystal volume. Therefore,
there is no need for the crystal to expand in length and impose a
change in the spherical shape of the PLDs. We are presently studying
if the reason for this is related to an increase in the amount of
bound water.

b Enthalpy
of dox-sulfate nanocrystals
is normalized to the doxorubicin concentrations listed in Table 1. For the two batches
of Lipodox, the enthalpy of the doxorubicin sulfate is normalized
to 3.45 mM doxorubicin.

c Endotherm was manually selected
and calculated in the temperature range from 15 to 70 °C.

There is a strong correlation between
the PLD’s morphology
and the thermotropic behavior of the PLDs’ dox-sulfate nanorod
crystals. In a previous study, we revealed that dox-sulfate nanocrystals
in Doxil exhibit a sharp reversible melting endotherm in the first
heating scan with Tm at ∼70 °C.9 Not surprisingly, no nanocrystal melting endotherm
was found for PLDs prepared with 100 mM AS that lack fully developed
intraliposomal nanocrystals (Figure 3a, black line, Table 2 and Figure 2b). In contrast, PLDs prepared with 150 mM AS, the “threshold
concentration” for the formation of fully developed nanocrystals,
exhibit intraliposomal nanocrystal melting endotherm (Figure 3a, blue line). However, the
much lower melting enthalpy (0.52 kcal/mol) and lower melting co-operativity
(ΔT1/2 of 6.72 °C) compared
with those prepared with ≥200 mM AS (enthalpy of 1.78–2.62
kcal/mol and ΔT1/2 of 2.6–4.0
°C, Table 3) suggest
that crystallinity degree of the nanocrystals formed at this threshold
is much lower. Although the lower enthalpy may also be explained by
the smaller fraction of doxorubicin present in the nanocrystalline
form, the lower co-operativity (broadened ΔT1/2) proves that the “quality” of the nanocrystal
is the main contributor to the difference in enthalpy. In addition,
the phase transition of the intraliposomal nanocrystals in PLDs with
150 mM AS is irreversible (Figure 3c) and occurs only in the first heating scan. This
irreversibility may be explained by weaker forces that “hold”
together the loosely packed nanocrystals and enable the larger and
quicker release of doxorubicin from the liposomes occurring during
the first heating scan above the nanocrystals’ Tm. As a result, insufficient doxorubicin remains inside
liposomes after the first heating scan to enable detectable recrystallization
during the cooling scan. On the other hand, all of the nanocrystals
in the PLDs prepared with ≥200 mM AS show a reversible melting/recrystallization
process (Figure S1, Supporting Information
and ref (9)), as was
observed for Lipodox (PLDs prepared with 250 mM AS). The physical
state of the intraliposomal nanocrystals above the intraliposome dox-sulfate
nanocrystal melting transition in PLDs that exhibit reversible dox-sulfate
phase transition is not yet clear. Further investigation with other
methods such as XRD are required. We observed that the nanocrystals
that exhibit reversible phase transition also have a much higher melting
enthalpy (Table 3),
namely, more energy is required to enable the meting. Indeed, they
are expected to a have better resistance to leakage during DSC scanning,
as described in our previous study.9

Figure 3 Thermograms
of PLDs prepared with different ammonium and/or sulfate
concentrations in the first heating scan (a, b) and the overlapped
thermograms of PLDs prepared with 150 mM AS (c), 100 mM AS and 150
mM ammonium chloride (d), 100 mM AS and 150 mM sodium sulfate (SS)
(e) and 250 mM AS (Lipodox Lot#JKL 3911) (f) in cycled DSC scanning.

Of special interest are the PLDs
prepared with the mixture of the
two salts. PLDs prepared with the mixture of 100 mM AS and 150 mM
ammonium chloride show only 63% loading efficiency (Table 1), much lower than those prepared
with 100 mM AS, despite theoretically having a larger transmembrane
ammonium gradient (350 vs 200 mM). These unexpected results may be
explained by the presence of 150 mM chloride in the intraliposomal
aqueous phase. The chloride ion has a much higher permeability coefficient
than that of the sulfate ion, and it may also be released from liposomes
in the form of HCl, “stealing” protons from the intraliposomal
doxorubicin and aqueous phase.14 Similar
to the other PLDs with low encapsulation efficiency, PLDs prepared
with the mixture of ammonium chloride and AS also show that only a
small fraction of these PLDs have fully developed nanocrystals (Figure 2g and Table 2). These PLDs also lack any
dox-sulfate melting endotherm (Figure 3b, green). The exotherm (upon heating) with Tm at 86 °C (Figure 3b, green) suggests an as yet unexplained
metastable process. Only the reversible phase transition of the membrane
lipids was observed in the cycled DSC scanning (Figure 3d), whereas PLDs prepared with a mixture
of 100 mM AS + 150 mM sodium sulfate share a similar morphology (Figure 2h) and thermotropic
behavior (Figure 3e)
to PLDs prepared with ≥200 mM AS and to Lipodox (Figure 3f). These findings strongly
support the critical role of intraliposomal sulfate concentration
in the crystallization of doxorubicin sulfate to form nanorod crystals.
The reversible phase transition of these nanocrystals also supports
the lack of drug leakage at temperatures above the Tm of the membrane lipids and the nanocrystals. However,
the intraliposomal nanocrystals in PLDs prepared with the AS and sodium
sulfate mixture recrystallize and remelt at ∼55 and 63 °C,
respectively (Figure 3e), both 3 °C lower than Lipodox (PLDs with 250 mM AS) (Figure 3f). The melting enthalpy
of the nanocrystals is also somewhat lower (1.22 kcal/mol compared
with 1.51 kcal/mol, Table 3), despite having an identical intraliposomal sulfate concentration
(250 mM). These results suggest that in addition to the sulfate counteranion,
the intraliposome ammonium ions that remain after doxorubicin remote
loading (Table 1) also
contribute to the properties of the dox-sulfate nanorod crystals (further
discussed below).

In Vitro Ammonia-Induced Doxorubicin Release
of PLDs
Based on the product information and certificates
of analysis,15 it is clear that Doxil exhibits
a good stability
and resists doxorubicin leakage upon long-term storage at 2–8
°C. Plasma pharmacokinetic studies in animals and humans show
that Doxil is also resistant to leakage in blood circulation.16,17 We previously demonstrated that ammonia/ammonium, which are continuously
generated in tumors due to the metabolic pathway of glutaminolysis,
may induce doxorubicin release at sufficient levels to achieve therapeutic
efficacy.6 The ammonia-induced release
of PLDs was recently reconfirmed by other researchers.18 Therefore, we use it here as a functional assay
that may predict the in vivo rate of doxorubicin release in tumor
tissues.

The mechanism of ammonia-induced doxorubicin release
is a reverse process of remote loading.5,6 It is based
on an exchange of ammonia gas that diffuses from the “release-medium”
across the liposome membrane into the intraliposomal aqueous phase,
concomitantly with the efflux of intraliposomal uncharged doxorubicin
into the medium.6 To be released, the doxorubicin
molecule needs to disassociate from intraliposomal doxorubicin sulfate
nanorod crystals and donate its proton to the liposome-internalized
ammonia, after which the unprotonated (neutral) doxorubicin molecule
diffuses across the liposome membrane into the medium.

The in
vitro release profiles of the PLDs clearly demonstrate the
relationship between the release rate and intraliposomal doxorubicin
sulfate nanocrystal properties. The presence of fully developed nanocrystals
determines the kinetic order and rate of doxorubicin release (Figure 4). This result suggests
that doxorubicin in the nanocrystal has a reduced tendency (compared
to doxorubicin that is not part of the nanocrystal) to donate its
proton to the liposome-internalized ammonia. Therefore, PLDs that
lack a significant level of fully developed nanocrystals, including
those prepared with 100 mM AS or with the mixture of 100 mM AS and
150 mM ammonium chloride, showed a biphasic release kinetics with
a rapid release phase in which ≥80% doxorubicin is released
within the first 3 h (Figure 4a, black and 4b, red line).

Figure 4 In vitro release
of the PLDs prepared with different intraliposomal
AS concentrations (a) and with the two mixed transmembrane ammonium
or sulfate gradients with the comparison to PLDs prepared in 250 mM
AS (b).

An additional factor is the degree
of nanocrystal crystallinity,
which in our study is quantified by the melting enthalpy and the co-operativity
of the nanocrystal melting endotherm. A lower melting enthalpy suggests
a weaker interaction between doxorubicin molecules in the nanocrystals,
therefore less energy is required for doxorubicin molecules to dissociate
from the nanocrystals and a faster release rate is expected. This
explains the faster release of doxorubicin from PLDs prepared with
150 mM AS than those prepared with ≥200 mM AS. Despite the
prevalent presence of intraliposomal nanocrystals in at least 90%
of the PLDS (Figure 2c) and a clear nanocrystal melting endotherm in the first heat scan,
PLDs prepared with 150 mM AS show a two-phase release-kinetics profile
with a fast release of 60% doxorubicin in the first 3 h (Figure 4a, red line). In
addition, the phase transition of intraliposomal nanocrystals in 150
mM AS PLDs is irreversible, possibly due to lower resistance to the
drug leakage that occurs during the DSC heat scans (as discussed above).
In comparison, PLDs with dox-sulfate nanocrystals having a melting
enthalpy and co-operativity close to that of Lipodox and Doxil/Caelyx
(including PLDs prepared with 200 and 300 mM AS) also show similar
slow and almost linear one-phasic, zero-order release profiles (Figure 4a, blue and green).

The third factor that affects the nanocrystal properties and doxorubicin
release is the residual ammonium concentration inside PLDs after doxorubicin
remote loading. The intraliposomal residual ammonium acts like a proton
buffer. A higher intraliposomal residual ammonium concentration is
expected to generate a higher transmembrane pH gradient (Table 1). Therefore, the
physicochemical properties of the PLDs vary with the intraliposomal
residual ammonium concentration, despite having a similar intraliposomal
sulfate concentration and drug-to-lipid mole ratio. Meanwhile, the
higher residual intraliposomal ammonium concentration after remote
loading, the slower the proton removal and release rate of doxorubicin.
This explains the faster release of PLDs prepared with the mixture
of 100 mM AS and 150 mM sodium sulfate as compared with that of 250
mM AS (Figure 4b, blue
and black lines). The sulfate concentration in both PLDs is identical,
whereas the residual ammonium concentration in the PLDs prepared with
250 mM AS is 18-fold higher (310 vs 17 mM; Table 1).

Conclusions
Our
results demonstrate the roles of ammonium and sulfate ions
in the remote loading of Doxil and their different and complimentary
contribution to remote loading stability and PLD performance (as followed
through the ammonia-induced doxorubicin release). The individual concentration
of each of the two ions and the ratio between them have a profound
effect on the morphology, physical state of intraliposomal doxorubicin
sulfate salt, and the thermotropic behavior of the PLDs. The lessons
learned from this study may enable significant improvement in the
design and characterization of liposome-based nanodrugs remotely loaded
with other APIs.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Hydrogenated
soybean phosphatidylcholine
(HSPC), cholesterol, and DSPE-PEG2k were obtained from Lipoid (Ludwigshafen,
Germany). For more details on these lipids, see Wei et al.9 Doxorubicin hydrochloride was obtained from Sicor,
Rho, Italy. Ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride, sodium sulfate, and
USP grade l-histidine were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt,
Germany). Analytical grade sucrose was obtained from Bio-Lab Ltd.
(Jerusalem, Israel). All of the other reagents used were of analytical
grade or better. High-purity water of conductivity 18.2 MΩ was
prepared using the Barnstead Nanopure ultrapure water purification
system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and referred as deionized
distilled water. Lipodox is a product of Sun Pharma (Gujarat, India).
All of the DSC studies of Lipodox were performed before the product
expiration date.

Methods
Precipitation Titration
of Doxorubicin to Ammonium Sulfate or
Sodium Sulfate
Doxorubicin hydrochloride (10 mg/mL) was added
dropwise to 2 mL ammonium sulfate or sodium sulfate solutions (pH
5.5) in concentrations of 100, 150, 250, and 500 mM under vigorous
magnetic stirring. The point at which the sulfate solution turned
turbid or “hazy” was regarded as the titration endpoint,
and the total volume of the doxorubicin solution added was recorded
and translated into final doxorubicin concentration. This concentration
was regarded as the minimum concentration necessary for precipitation.

“Reverse titration” was carried out with doxorubicin
at various concentrations: 2, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 mM doxorubicin
solutions were added dropwise to 150, 250, or 500 mM ammonium sulfate
solution (pH 5.5), respectively. The volume of doxorubicin used to
reach the initial precipitation in each counterion solution was recorded
and translated into final doxorubicin concentration. The first points
of titration were excluded from the calculation as being of too low
doxorubicin or ammonium sulfate concentrations.

Preparation
of Doxorubicin-Loaded Liposomes (PLDs) in Different
Ammonium and Sulfate Concentrations
Two groups of blank SUVs
having membrane lipid composition identical to that of Doxil and Lipodox,
but differing in their intraliposomal concentrations of ammonium or
sulfate ions, were prepared as previously described.5,10 In summary, in the first group, ammonium sulfate solutions of different
concentrations (100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 mM, ammonium-to-sulfate
mole ratio = 2:1) were used. In the second group, an ammonium sulfate
solution (100 mM) mixed with sodium sulfate or ammonium chloride (both
at 150 mM) was used. Namely, in the second group, the ratio of ammonium
to sulfate varied. Osmolality of the above solutions was measured
using the freezing point depression method (Advanced Micro-Osmometer,
model 3320, Advanced Instruments, MA). The transmembrane ion gradients
were created by diafiltration using Labscale TFF system (Millipore,
MA) against 10% sucrose. The desired PLDs prepared by adding doxorubicin
hydrochloride solution to these SUVs to a final doxorubicin concentration
of 2 to ∼16 mg/mL total lipids followed by incubation at 60
°C for 30 min. Histidine buffer (pH 6.5, to a final 10 mM concentration)
was added after cooling. The PLD dispersion’s osmolality is
350–360 mOsm/kg.8 The blank liposomes
and PLDs were stored at 2–8 °C until use.

Liposome
Characterization
All of the liposomal dispersions
used in this study were characterized for phospholipid concentrations
by the modified Bartlett method19 and/or
high-performance liquid chromatography with evaporative light-scattering
detection; size and size distribution via dynamic light scattering
(DLS)20 by a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS
(Worcestershire, U.K.); and drug encapsulation using the cationic
exchanger Dowex 50 assay.21,22

Transmembrane
pH gradients of the liposomes were measured by [14C]-methylamine
distribution as previously described.23 In brief, [14C]-methylamine (23.8 μCi/mL) was added
to freshly prepared SUVs before and after doxorubicin loading. The
pH of the extraliposomal medium was maintained at pH 6.5 by 50 mM
histidine saline. After 20 min incubation at 55 °C, the liposome
dispersions were diluted with 50 mM histidine saline and divided equally
into two parts. One part of the liposome solution was ultracentrifuged
using Amicon Ultra-15 tubes using a filter of 100 K molecular weight
cutoff (Millipore, MA) for the separation of the unencapsulated (extraliposome
medium) from the encapsulated [14C]-methylamine. The medium
collected after ultracentrifugation and the other part of the original
liposome dispersion (before centrifugation) were first treated with
Opti-Fluor (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) and stored overnight at 2–8
°C before scintillation counting of the radioactivity by a β-counter.
The ratio of [14C]-methylamine between the liposomes and
the extraliposomal medium used to calculate the transmembrane pH gradient
is  The trapped volume
of the resulting PLDs was
measured in the intraliposomal sulfate concentration and analyzed
by ion chromatography24 on an ICSep AN2
(anion exchange column, Transgenomic, Omaha, NE) with carbonate/bicarbonate
eluent and conductivity detection. For 16 mg/mL of lipids present
in Lipodox and Doxil, it amounted to 1.7% of the total volume.

Cryo-TEM
Characterization of PLDs Prepared with Different Ammonium
and Sulfate Concentrations
Direct imaging of the liposomes
was performed by cryo-TEM.25 Vitrified
specimens were prepared on a copper grid coated with a perforated
lacey carbon 300 mesh (Ted Pella, CA). Prior to specimen preparation,
the grids were plasma-etched to increase their hydrophilicity. Typically,
a drop (3–4 μL) of the solution was applied to a grid
in a controlled environment (25 °C and 100% relative humidity),
and blotted with filter paper to form a thin liquid film of solution.
The automatically blotted sample was immediately plunged into liquid
ethane (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). The vitrified specimens
were transferred into liquid nitrogen for storage. The samples were
studied using an FEI Tecnai 12 G2 TWIN TEM (FEI, Oregon),
which was operated at 120 kV in low-dose mode to minimize electron
beam radiation damage with a Gatan 626 cryo-holder maintained at −183
°C. Images recorded using a Gatan charge-coupled device camera
(model 794) and analyzed by Digital Micrograph software (version 3.1).

The structure of the PLDs were analyzed from the cryo-TEM images
using MATLAB software programmed by Sivan Peretz-Damari in Prof. Oren
Regev’s laboratory.11 Briefly, 200–700
well-separated PLDs were analyzed for each sample. The lengths of
the major (long) axis and the minor (short) axis of each liposome
were determined by the image analysis, and the aspect ratio was calculated
as the PLDs’ shape index. A PEG layer that does not have sufficient
mass-thickness contrast cannot be determined by cryo-TEM imaging.
Therefore, we added the 9.6 nm to the long axis and the short axis
(2 times the 4.8 ± 1.2 nm thickness of the PEG layer on the external
liposome surface as previously determined by us using SAXS8,10).

The percentage of the vesicles having fully developed intraliposomal
doxorubicin sulfate nanorod crystals was manually counted using 300–600
PLD particles. The fully developed nanorod crystals are defined as
those that are clearly imaged because they demonstrate a high electron
density and hence a higher contrast in the cryo-TEM images (Figure 2c–f and Table 2).

The width
of the intraliposomal doxorubicin sulfate nanorod crystals
was manually measured using Digital Micrograph software (Gatan, CA).
The average and SD of the crystal width were calculated based on the
measurement of 50 PLDs for each of the PLDs prepared at the different
ammonium sulfate concentrations (see above).

Resolution of the
PLDs’ axis and intraliposome nanocrystal
width measurement was 1 nm.

DSC Measurements
The blank SUVs and PLDs prepared with
different ammonium and sulfate concentrations were scanned using high-sensitivity
MicroCal VP-DSC system (Malvern, Worcestershire, U.K.). Based on our
previous experience with Doxil and Lipodox,9 scanning was carried out at a slow rate of 1.0 °C/min to achieve
conditions close to the thermodynamic equilibrium.26 The samples were vacuum degassed by the MicroCal ThermoVac
system (Malvern, Worcestershire, U.K.). The samples and the reference
(10% sucrose in 10 mM histidine buffer pH 6.5) were scanned in a cycle
of heat–cool–reheat from 15 to 90 °C, using a filtering
period of 10 s and the feedback mode of “Mid”. The sucrose/histidine
buffer used as a reference for all of the liposomal samples was identical
to the PLD storage medium. For more details on DSC measurements and
the justification of measurements’ conditions, see Wei et al.9

Calculation of the thermodynamic parameters
was carried out using Microcal LLC DSC workstation software (Malvern,
Worcestershire, U.K.). Initially, the original thermograms were corrected
by baseline subtraction and normalized to lipid or doxorubicin concentrations.
The “lipid-related” endotherms/exotherms were normalized
to phosphatidylcholine (PC) concentration, whereas the ones related
to dox-sulfate nanocrystals were normalized to “apparent”
(as actual intraliposomal doxorubicin concentration is difficult to
calculate due to dox-sulfate intraliposome crystallization) intraliposome
doxorubicin concentration (Table 1). The normalized thermograms were analyzed by one-
or two-peak nonlinear modeling at the smallest chi-square or reduced
chi-square values. The thermodynamic parameters were calculated from
the obtained endotherms/exotherms in the thermograms: the model with
the closest Tm to the Tm of the lipids or the nanocrystals was selected for membrane
or intraliposome crystals, respectively, and the enthalpy (ΔH) and ΔT1/2 (a measure
of phase transition co-operativity) were calculated correspondingly. Tm was determined by the workstation from the
normalized thermograms. The excellent repeatability and reproducibility
of the DSC measurements for PLDs were demonstrated previously in Figure S1 and Table S1 of Wei et al.9

In Vitro Release of Doxorubicin from PLDs
with Different Ammonium
and Sulfate Concentrations
In vitro release was carried out
based on the procedure described by Silverman and Barenholz6 and scaled up to a standard pharmaceutical dissolution
tester Vision G2 Classic 6 (Hanson, Chatsworth, CA). A medium of normal
saline, buffered with 20 mM histidine to pH 7.3 ± 0.1, was used.
Ammonium sulfate (50 mM) served as the doxorubicin release inducer.
Dowex 50WX4 cation-exchange resin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was
employed as a “sink” for the released drug as well as
for differentiating between liposomal and “free” doxorubicin.10
