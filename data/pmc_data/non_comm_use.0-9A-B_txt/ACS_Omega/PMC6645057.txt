Discrimination
of illegal cooking oil is a conundrum in the fields
of analytical chemistry and food safety due to complicated sample
systems, lack of common targets, and stringent demand of ultrahigh
detection sensitivity for corresponding analytical methods. Capsaicin,
one of the exogenous molecules that is subsistent in recycled kitchen
waste oils, can be regarded as a target for illegal cooking oil identification.
Nowadays, tracing capsaicin in oils is implemented mainly by high-performance
liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry, which displays shortcomings
in high costs and incapableness for field test. Here, we established
a surface-enhanced resonance Raman scattering approach to detect capsaicin
and identify illegal cooking oils by means of the molecular derivatization
treatment of capsaicin. This method features high detection sensitivity
with the detection limit of 1.0 × 10–8 M, rapid
response (<7 min detection duration), and simplicity in sample
pretreatment, which is available for fast field test of illegal cooking
oils.

Introduction
In recent years, cooking
oil safety accidents have occurred frequently
in developing countries increasing the attention toward food safety
inspection. Illegal cooking oils, generally referring to all kinds
of abandoned inferior inedible oils, mainly consists of kitchen waste
oils, also called “underground drainage oils” in China.
Reuse of these grease wastes for cooking is legally prohibited even
if they have been purified by filtration, distillation, decoloration,
deodorizing, and refining processes. Inedible oils are usually contaminated
by hazardous additives, such as condiments, heavy metal ions, biotoxins,
phthalates, and oil oxides,1−5 which are extremely harmful to human health if consumed in large
amounts or small doses chronically. The complete removal of contaminants
or additives in waste oils is almost impossible in most illicit refining
industries. It has been reported that up to 3 million tons of waste
oils are distributed back to Chinese dining tables annually.6 The main reason for the long-term existence of
blended waste oils with edible ones or mixing the spurious with the
genuine is due to the lack of an effective, fast, and cheap testing
method. Methods and indicators for identifying illegal cooking oil
have attracted widespread attention and are also in urgent demand.
Current efforts have been devoted to discriminating oils based on
the evaluation of compositions (cholesterol and fatty acid) and physical
parameters (e.g., conductivity), as well as the detection of foreign
contaminants (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, benzopyrene, plasticizers,
aflatoxin, etc.) according to National Food Safety Standards.7 However, these parameters can only tell the oil
quality and cannot give a definite conclusion that the oil is from
the recycled “drainage oils” or not. Also, exogenous
pollutions that come from raw materials or the process of storage
and refining can also lead to a false judgment. Therefore, a gold
standard for the discrimination of drainage oils is required.

Capsaicine, including capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin, is the main
active chemical extract of the fruits and seeds of capsaicum plants,
which gives the hot/burning sensation of spicy peppers. The concentration
of capsaicin can reach 4.249 mg g–1 in some kind
of peppers.8 As the basic five tastes,
pungent condiments are indispensable and generally used in different
types of dishes. Capsicine will most likely remain in the cooking
oil after being used in dishes due to its oleophilic feature, no matter
what kinds of retreatments had been implemented in the oil recovery.
Therefore, capsaicin can be a qualitative basis for the identification
of drainage oil.9 Different from other
hazardous contaminants in cooking oils, capsaicin is very safe for
human body even in a high concentration as much as many hot peppers.
To trace capsaicin in edible oils, Chen’s group established
a detection method by high-performance liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (HPLC–MS).10,11 A total of 67 blind
samples from the National Food Safety Risk Assessment Center were
analyzed. One of the important things is that they have proven that
capsaicin is an excellent indicator for the identification of drainage
oils. The correct recognition rates for positive and negative samples
were 75 and 100%, respectively.12 Recently,
the method of solid-phase extraction-HPLC–MS has become one
of the four instrument examination methods for identifying drainage
oils according to the latest information publicized by the National
Ministry of Health, China.13 However, owing
to the large and expensive MS equipment and high testing cost per
sample, these MS-based methods face difficulties for rapid field analysis
in food safety and market monitoring.

Herein, surface-enhanced
resonance Raman scattering (SERRS) technique
was adopted to establish an ultrasensitive detection method for an
exogenous substance (capsaicin) in illegal cooking oils. With a molecule
derivative technology based on a diazotization procedure for the aromatic
amines of capsaicin, the product displays colors and SERRS activity.
We adapted magnetic surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-active
particles to enhance the signal of the capsaicin derivatives, and
a portable Raman instrument is enough for the measurement (Scheme S2). This SERRS method for the identification
of drainage oil is simple, rapid, and ultrasensitive, which are required
for accurate field analysis.

Surface-enhanced Raman scattering
(SERS) spectroscopy is based
on the smart combination of nanomaterials and Raman spectrum technology
and becomes a very important spectroscopic technique in modern analysis
and detection fields with its single molecule level detection capability.14−17 SERRS, a combination of resonance Raman and SERS, can further amplify
Raman signal as a fold of 104 relative to SERS, which results
in a higher detection sensitivity and provides broader applications
in analysis of ultralow concentrations. As is well known, the prerequisite
condition for SERRS is to resonate the electronic energy levels of
probed molecules with the wavelengths of the incident lasers.18−20 Thus, it is convenient to implement molecular derivatization strategies
to convert colorless analytes into species with absorption band that
match the wavelength of a commonly used laser.

Results and Discussion
Capsaicin has a low SERS cross section and faces difficulty in
chemical and physical adsorption on metal surfaces. Therefore, the
direct detection of capsaicin in oils by SERS is infeasible. Owing
to the molecular character of capsaicin, that is, a phenolic compound,
a derivatization strategy was designed to convert it into an azo dye,
which fortunately supports high SERS activity. The procedures follow
the Pauly reaction21,22 that involves two steps (Figure 1): (1) pretreating
the derivation agents (many aromatic amines have been tried and 2,2′-benzidinedisulfonic
acid is preferred; see Figure S2 in SI)
to produce a diazonium salt with the addition of NaNO2 in
aromatic amine in solution, and (2) reacting capsaicin with the diazonium
salt under basic conditions (NaCO3 added). Then, the capsaicin
derivative is obtained. The total derivation time can be completed
within 1 min. To investigate the resonance absorption of targets at
excitation light, capsaicin derivatives were prepared by adding different
aromatic amines, including 2,5-diaminobenzenesulfonic acid, sodium
diphenylamine-4-sulfonate, 1-naphthylamine-4-sulfonic acid, 6-amino-1-naphthalenesulfonic
acid, sulfanilic acid, and 2,2′-benzidinedisulfonic acid. Their
structural formulas are shown as (a–f) in Figure S2. SERRS signal amplification is closely related to
the surface plasmon resonance of metal nanoparticles, laser excitation
wavelength, and molecular resonance.23 If
the probed molecule contains a molecular resonance that overlaps with
the laser excitation, additional orders of magnitude in signal intensity
can be gained.24,25 SERS spectra of the capsaicin
derivative under different incident laser wavelengths at 514, 532,
633, and 785 nm were recorded and are shown in Figure S3a. It should be noted that the peak intensities are
normalized by the laser power. Figure S3b displays the histogram of the SERS peak intensity at 1361 cm–1 of capsaicin derivative. By comparing SERS intensities,
the strong enhancement was obtained when the excitation wavelengths
of 532 nm were used. The structure of the target derivative was confirmed
by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–time-of-flight–mass
spectrometry (MALDI–TOF–MS) (Figure S4).

Figure 1 Derivatization reaction route of capsaicin (a). UV–vis spectra
(b) and SERRS spectra (c) of capsaicin and its derivation agent.

UV–vis absorption spectra
of capsaicin before and after
derivatization with 2,2′-benzidinedisulfonic acid and of the
intermediate product (diazonium salt) are illustrated in Figure 1b, which indicates
that the derivatization reagent and the intermediate product (diazonium
salt) have no absorption band in the visible range, whereas the capsaicin
derivative shows a new band at about 506 nm. The SERS spectra of diazonium
salt and capsaicin derivative were both measured (Figure 1c) using a B&W Tek Raman
spectrometer with a portable optical fiber probe and 532 nm excitation
wavelength. It can be found that the diazonium salt does not show
SERS signal, indicating neither 2,2′-benzidinedisulfonic acid
nor the diazonium salt intermediate gives background interference
in the SERRS spectrum. Compared to that of diazonium salt, the SERRS
spectrum of capsaicin derivative is remarkably strong and identifiable.
The main peaks are located at 1191, 1361, 1429, 1574, and 1606 cm–1, which are assigned to υ(C–C) from phenol
groups, δ(C–H), ν(N=N), ν(C=C)
from phenyl rings, and υ(C–N), respectively, according
to the previous reports.26 It should be
noted that this derivative supports a broad background in its SERRS
spectrum due to the fluorescence emission.

The derivation reaction
makes capsaicin traceable in the SERRS
detection. However, as derivatization reaction must be performed in
water phase, capsaicin should be extracted from the vegetable oil
to water phase using different extraction solvents via liquid–liquid
extraction. More discussions on capsaicin extraction and HPLC characterization
are provided in Figure S5. The capsaicin
extraction liquid was next used for the derivatization treatment as
stated above. Then, the capsaicin derivative sample was mixed with
magnetic SERS-active beads for the enrichment, separation, and SERRS
detection of analytes. Figure 2 shows SERRS spectra of the capsaicin derivative at different
concentrations and the linear calibration curve obtained by plotting
the SERS intensity of capsaicin derivative at 1361 cm–1 (each data point represents an average of three trials). The linear
regression equation is expressed as y = 1022.27x + 9477.19 (R2 = 0.9880), and
the detection range is 1.0 × 10–5–1.0
× 10–9 M. For a fast field detection purpose,
a higher detection sensitivity and reliability of testing are much
more important for a qualitative detection. To evaluate the lowest
detection limit of the method, we chose three kinds of vegetable oil
samples, soybean oil, maize oil, and blend oil (six samples for one
oil, total trials n = 18). The blank samples were
spiked to 1.0 × 10–8 M with a standard capsaicin
solution as illegal cooking oils for subsequent extraction and detection.
The operation procedures of the proposed method are illustrated in Scheme S1, and the detection results are listed
in Table S1. The accuracy of this SERRS
method for capsaicin is 100% (n = 18). According
to Wang’ study, cooking oil samples could be identified as
illegal ones when the contents of capsaicin are over 1 μg L–1.9 In the present study,
SERRS method can achieve a detection limit of 1.0 × 10–8 M (0.31 μg L–1), indicating this detection
limit will be applicable for the identification of most illegal cooking
oils.

(a). Intensity of the band at 1361 cm–1 versus the
concentration of the capsaicin derivative (b).

To evaluate the selectivity and feasibility of derivative
SERRS
method for capsaicin, the interference responses of various foreign
species in vegetable oils were tested, involving tert-butylhydroquinone,27,28dl-α-tocopherol,29,30 and bisphenol A,31,32 and their chemical structures
are shown in Figure 3a. Among them, tert-butylhydroquinone and dl-α-tocopherol are highly effective food-grade phenolic antioxidants
that may be added during oil processing and storage. Bisphenol A is
one of the common additives used in the plastics industry, and it
causes food (oil) contamination by contacting with packages. These
interfering substances in vegetable oils were tested by SERRS spectroscopy
with the assistance of the same molecular derivatization reaction.
As shown in Figure 3b, there are no SERS signals when tert-butylhydroquinone
and dl-α-tocopherol were added in sample at the same
concentration (1.0 × 10–5 M), indicating they
cannot bring interference to capsaicin SERRS determination. Differently,
bisphenol A can be converted into an azo dye. However, the bisphenol
A derivative provides totally different SERS fingerprints that are
distinguishable from that of the capsaicin derivative. Figure 3c shows the UV–vis spectra
of three derivatives, in which neither color changes nor the absorption
bands in the visible range were observed for tert-butylhydroquinone and dl-α-tocopherol, implying both
of them cannot be converted into azo dyes using this derivative method,
probably due to the large space resistance and electrophilic substitution
effect of substitutes on benzene. Figure 3c also shows the obvious color change of
bisphenol A derivative and a new band appearing at about 450 nm, which
is different from the capsaicin derivative that exhibits the absorption
maximum at 506 nm. Therefore, we can conclude that there are no interferences
from these three substances and that the molecular derivatization-assisted
SERRS technique has excellent selectivity toward capsaicin.

Conclusions
In summary, aiming at
the identification of illegal cooking oil,
we established an ultrasensitive detection method for the exogenous
target, capsaicin, based on a molecular derivatization strategy via
SERRS spectroscopy. Combined with a magnetic separation SERS substrate,
this method can achieve a detection limit of 1.0 × 10–8 M. Batches of interference experiments show that our proposed SERRS
method has a good selectivity for capsaicin in vegetable oils, and
it can be a gold standard for the identification of drainage oils
due to its trivialness, rapidity, and ultrasensitivity. The whole
sensing duration can be completed within 7 min. Compared to the HPLC–MS
method, this method not only shows superiority in time and cost savings,
but also displays applicability in fast field detections when equipped
with portable Raman instruments.

Experimental Section
Reagents
and Materials
Capsaicin, tert-butylhydroquinone,
α-tocopherol, bisphenol A, iron(III) chloride
hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O), ethylene glycol
(EG), sodium acetate anhydrous (NaAc), silver nitrate (AgNO3), sodium citrate (C6H5Na3O7·2H2O), anhydrous ethanol, 2,5-diaminobenzenesulfonic
acid, sodium diphenylamine-4-sulfonate, sulfonic acid, 1-naphthylamine-4-sulfonic
acid, 6-amino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid, 2,2′-benzidinedisulfonic
acid, sodium nitrite, sodium carbonate hydrochloride, methanol (chromatographic
grade), and ethylene imine polymer (PEI 10 000, 99%) were obtained
from Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Capsaicin stock
solution (1.0 × 10–3 M) was prepared by accurately
weighing a certain quantity of reference materials and dissolving
them in methanol. Different concentrations of standard solutions were
prepared by diluting the stock solutions with vegetable oil and stored
in the dark at 4 °C before use.

Instruments
X-ray
diffraction data were taken from
a Bruker D8 Focus with Cu Kα radiation (k =
1.5406 Å). UV–vis spectra were taken at 200–800
nm from a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrometer. High-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) analysis was carried out on a Shimadzu LC-20AB system (Kyoto,
Japan) equipped with a CTO-10AS column oven and an RF-10Axl fluorescence
detector. The chromatographic separation of analytes was performed
on a VP-ODS C18 column (5 μm, 4.6 mm × 150 mm i.d.). The
mobile phase used was methanol/water (62:38). Its flow rate was 1.0
mL min–1, the excitation wavelength was 275 nm,
and the emission wavelength was 352 nm for capsaicin. The injection
volume was 20 μL. SERS spectra of analytes were recorded using
a B&W Tek Raman spectrometer with a portable optical fiber probe
and 532 nm excitation wavelength. The integration time was 5 s. The
laser power reaching the samples was 5.01 mW. In addition, Raman spectra
under other different excitation lasers (514, 633, and 785 nm) were
separately obtained by a Horiba Jobin Yvon T64000 Raman spectrometer
equipped with a water-cooled Ar ion laser as excitation source (514
nm), a Horiba Jobin Yvon LabRAM Aramis Raman microscopy system, which
is equipped with a water-cooled He–Ne-ion laser (λex = 633 nm) and another B&W Tek Raman spectrometer with
a portable optical fiber probe and 785 nm excitation wavelength. Mass
spectra of capsaicin derivatives were obtained on matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization–time-of-flight–mass spectrometry
(MALDI–TOF–MS, Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). Capsaicin
derivative samples (1 μL) were overlaid with 1 μL of MALDI
matrix (a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid
in 50% acetonitrile–2.5% trifluoroacetic acid) and detected
by MALDI–TOF–MS. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
analysis was acquired on a Hitachi SU8020 scanning electron microscopy
(Tokyo, Japan). The shape and size of the produced AgNPs were measured
by a JEM-2100F field emission transmission electron microscopy (JEOL,
Tokyo, Japan).

Preparation of Fe3O4@Ag Particles
Fe3O4@Ag particles were
fabricated on the basis
of a reported method.33 AgNPs with the
size of about 40 nm (Figure S1a) were first
synthesized according to the Lee and Meisel method.34 Briefly, 27 mg of AgNO3 was dissolved in ultrapure
water (150 mL) and brought to boiling. Then, 3.0 mL of 1% trisodium
citrate was added and boiling was continued for 40 min. Next, Fe3O4 particles were prepared according to the solvothermal
reduction method.35 After that, 50 mg of
the as-prepared Fe3O4 particles was functionalized
with PEI by suspending them in 100 mL of 5.0 mg mL–1 positively charged PEI solution. PEI supplies amino groups around
Fe3O4 particles. Then, AgNPs were aggregated
on the amino-functionalized Fe3O4 microspheres
to produce Fe3O4@Ag particles (Figure S1b). The produced Fe3O4@Ag particles
were characterized by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy via a casting
film, and the result shows the existence of Fe and Ag elements (Figure S1c).

Detection Procedures of
Capsaicin
Capsaicin detection
from vegetable oil mainly includes the following processes: capsaicin
extraction, derivatization, and SERS detection. Capsaicin extraction:
2 mL of vegetable oil and 4 mL of extraction reagent were added to
a centrifuge tube (10 mL) and static stratification was conducted
after vortexing for 5 min to obtain solvent layer containing capsaicin.
Derivatization: the capsaicin derivative was synthesized by adding
NaNO2 (1 mL), aromatic amines (1 mL), capsaicin extract
(1 mL), and NaCO3 (1 mL) solution at a certain concentration
to the centrifuge tube (10 mL) and then manually vortexing for 1 min
at room temperature. SERS detection: magnetic SERS substrate particles
(50 mg mL–1, 20 μL) were dispersed in the
above sample solution (1 mL). To make capsaicin derivative molecules
adsorbed onto magnetic beads, the sample solution and beads were incubated
for 1 min at room temperature in a vortex mixer set at the lowest
speed. The capsaicin derivative molecules adsorbed on Fe3O4@Ag particles were then separated and enriched by a
16-hole magnetic rack. SERS measurement of capsaicin derivative molecules
was conducted using a B&W Tek Raman spectrometer with a portable
optical fiber probe and 532 nm excitation wavelength.

Evaluation
of Accuracy Experiment
The accuracy of derivative
SERRS method for capsaicin detection in vegetable oil was verified
by the spike-and-recovery experiment. Three kinds of vegetable oils,
soybean oil, maize oil, and blend oil, were collected from supermarkets.
Real samples were obtained by adding capsaicin standard solutions
in vegetable oil with the final concentration of 1.0 × 10–8 M, which were used as analogues of illegal cooking
oils for next extraction and detection.
