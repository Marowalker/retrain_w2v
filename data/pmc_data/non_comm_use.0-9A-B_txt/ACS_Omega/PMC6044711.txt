Multifunctional
polymeric nanoaggregates could enable targeted cancer therapy and
imaging, which eventually facilitate monitoring of the therapeutic
effect. A fluorescent nanoaggregate is constructed for theranostic
application. Chlorambucil (Chl), a fluorescent inactive chemotherapeutic
agent, is covalently attached to the nanoaggregate for therapeutic
action. The pyrene (Py) motif is also covalently attached to the nanoaggregates,
with the motivation of cancer cell imaging. This nanoaggregate is
further functionalized with biotin (Btn) for receptor-mediated drug
delivery. The efficiency of this system is evaluated by in vitro cell
studies to prove its receptor-mediated internalization as well as
theranostic capabilities. This newly designed nanocarrier, Nor–Chl–Py–Btn
(Nor, norbornene), has the ability to combine both therapeutic and
diagnostic capabilities into a single polymer that offers existing
prospects for the development of nanomedicine.

==== Body
Introduction
Theranostics is a concept that deals with the integration of
therapy and diagnostics.1−4 Cancer treatment
gets delayed due to the absence of proper tools for the early stage detection, which reduces survival rates.5 Among the various cancer treatments currently
practiced, chemotherapy continues to be the best option, primarily
because of its high efficiency.5 There
are a number of anticancer drugs available, among which chlorambucil
(Chl) is an efficient chemotherapeutic agent against various cancers.6−9 Chl
belongs to a class of DNA-alkylating agents that has proven to be
clinically important for the treatment against various cancers.6−9 Chl
exhibits its mode of action through the alkylation of the N7 atoms
of guanine or adenine as well as the N3 of adenine in double-helical
DNA, which leads to apoptotic cell death through the accumulation
of persistent DNA damage.6−9 However, despite its several advantages,
Chl suffers from several limitations, including drug solubility, stability,
selectivity, and resistance.5 Adverse side
effects on healthy tissues, multidrug resistance, and several other
factors have restricted the use of Chl in conventional chemotherapy.

There are a number of prodrug
systems to overcome this obstacle, for example, nanoparticles, liposomes,
and polymers, among which polymeric systems are always preferable
due to their advantage of including many functional groups, which
can overcome the poor pharmacokinetics, inappropriate distribution,
and poor solubility and facilitate faster clearance of the drugs.5,10The
ability to include a receptor moiety for site specificity makes the
system a highly potential candidate in anticancer therapeutics, as
this moiety can recognize cancer cells from among healthy cells, which
enables systematic distribution of the drug inside the body.5 Chl is nonfluorescent in nature because of which
it is difficult to monitor its therapeutic path in the cell in vitro
study.18−20 To overcome
this, we have designed a prodrug system that contains the drug along
with pyrene (Py), which helps monitor the system under a fluorescence
microscope 
during in vitro studies.11−15,18 For site-specificity and longer blood circulation,
we have introduced biotin (Btn)-derived polyethylene glycol (PEG),
as cancer cell lines show overexpression of the Btn receptor.16−18,22

Results and Discussion
Toward
the goal of site-specific therapy as well as tracking of the nonfluorescent
chemotherapeutic drug Chl, we designed three different monomers, namely, Mono 1, Mono 2, and Mono 3 (Scheme 1). The formation
of Mono 1, Mono 2, and Mono 3 was completely characterized by 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy (Figures 1 and S1–S10). The two-step
synthesis of Mono 1 was characterized using 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy (Figures 1 and S1–S3). In the case of 1, the alcoholic proton (−OH)
appeared at δ = 4.7 ppm in DMSO-d6 (Figure S1). The formation of Mono
1 was confirmed by the disappearance of the signal due to −OH
at 4.7 ppm, and all other new peaks appeared corresponding to Chl,
which clearly confirmed the formation of Mono 1 (Figure 1a). The 13C NMR spectrum also clearly proved the formation of the product,
as a new signal arose at δ = 172 ppm (Figure S3). The formation of Mono 1 was also confirmed
by the electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESIMS) technique
(Figure S16). The synthesis of Mono
2 was also a two-step process, starting from commercially available
exo-5 norbornene carboxylic anhydride. The anhydride was reacted with
ethanol amine to get 1 as a pure white crystalline product
(Figures S1 and S2). This product upon
reaction with 4-(1-pyrenyl) butyric acid in the presence
of the reagents N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide
(DCC) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) gave norbornene (Nor)–Py
(Mono 2). The formation of Mono 2 was confirmed
by NMR spectroscopy and the ESIMS technique (Figures 1b, S4, and S17). For making the system water soluble, we synthesized Nor–PEG–Btn
(Mono 3). To attach the Btn moiety, we first prepared
amine-terminated Nor–PEG. For that, we synthesized boc-protected
glycine (2) (Scheme 1). Boc anhydride was used to block the amine group
of the glycine (1.05 equiv), which further reacted with PEG in tetrahydrofuran
(THF) (1 equiv) (Mn = 1450 Da) in the
presence of DCC and DMAP to give the one free −OH containing
compound, 3, which had one free −OH of the PEG
moiety (Figure S7). The free −OH
group of compound 3 was functionalized with exo-Nor carboxylic
acid in the presence of the reagents DCC and DMAP. The product was
precipitated in cold hexane to obtain the boc-protected Nor–PEG
amine (4) (Figure S8). Deprotection
of compound 4 was carried out using trifluroacetic acid.
The formation of product 5 was confirmed by the disappearance
of the δ = 1.39 ppm peak (Figure S9), the characteristic peak of the boc methyl proton.

NMR spectra of Mono’s 1 and 2.

After
successful synthesis of amine-terminated Nor–PEG (5), Btn was reacted to it in the presence of the reagents DCC and
DMAP (Scheme 1) to
get Nor–PEG–Btn (Mono 3), which was highly
water soluble. The formation of the product was characterized by an 1H NMR spectrum (Figure S10), in
which all of the characteristic peaks appeared. The formation of Mono 3 was also confirmed by the matrix-assisted laser desorption
ionization (MALDI) spectroscopy technique (Figure S18). After the successful synthesis of all monomers (Scheme 1; Figures 1 and S1–S10), the livingness conditions of all three monomers were explored.
The linear increase in the molecular weight (Mn) of the homopolymers with increasing monomer/initiator ratio
confirms the livingness (Figure 2a).

Copolymer (Nor–Chl–Py–Btn)
Figure 2 (a) Mn vs M/I plot

chromatography (GPC) chromatogram of the final copolymer (Nor–Chl–Py–Btn).

After confirming
the livingness of all three monomers, the copolymerization condition
was explored (Scheme 2).18,21,22 The
monomers (Mono’s 1–3) were
dissolved in dry dichloromethane (DCM) and MeOH in a 9:1 ratio. A
desired amount of second-generation Grubbs’ catalyst (G-2)
was added in a two-necked flask, flushed with nitrogen, and dissolved
in a minimum amount of anhydrous DCM (1 mL); this was then added to
the flask containing the monomers. The monomer ratio for the copolymer
synthesis was 1:1:1.5 mol equiv (Mono 1/Mono 2/Mono 3). The reaction was allowed to occur at room
temperature, with stirring, until the polymerization was complete.
After completion of the reaction, ethyl vinyl ether (0.5 mL) was added
to quench the polymerization. An aliquot was taken for GPC analysis,
and the remaining product was precipitated from ether, dissolved in
THF again, passed through neutral alumina, and re-precipitated from
ether.

The molecular weight of the copolymer was measured on
a GPC instrument using a polymethyl methacrylate standard (Mn = 26 000, polydispersity index (PDI)
= 1.11) (Figure 2b).
After demonstrating successful synthesis of the copolymer (Nor–Chl–Py–Btn),
the critical aggregation concentration (CAC) was calculated by measuring
the fluorescence intensity of Nile red at different polymeric concentrations.26 The intensity was almost the same up to a certain
polymeric concentration then an enhancement in the intensity confirmed
dye encapsulation within the polymeric nanoaggregates. CAC was calculated
by plotting the fluorescence intensity of Nile red at 636 nm against
the polymeric concentration. The observed CAC value of Nor–Chl–Py–Btn
was 1.2 μg/mL
(Figure 3).

To measure
the size of the newly designed nanoaggregates, dynamic light scattering
(DLS) analysis was carried out under an aqueous environment. Because
of the presence of large as well as complex amphiphilicity, Nor–Chl–Py–Btn
was expected to self-assemble in the polar environment (Scheme 3).18,23,24

To confirm the aggregation
of Nor–Chl–Py–Btn, DLS analysis was performed.
The size of the aggregate was observed to be 90 nm, with a PDI of
0.35 (Figure 4a). To
visualize the shape of the nanoaggregates, scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed. From
SEM and TEM (Figure 4b,c) analysis, the nanoaggregates were found to be spherical, with
a size of about 90 nm, which was in good agreement with DLS measurements.
The stability of the nanoaggregate system was confirmed by monitoring
the particle size with respect to time. The particle size of Nor–Chl–Py–Btn
in buffer (pH 7.4) was measured over intervals spanning days, and
it was found that the particle size remained the same (Figure S12). After stabilization of the nanoaggregate
in water, a photophysical study was carried out to authenticate its
fluorescence property. The fluorescence emission spectrum of Mono 2 in DCM showed three characteristic monomer emission
peaks at 375, 397, and 417 nm. The same was observed for 4-(1-pyrenyl)
butyric acid as well. No stacking was observed at the monomeric level
at micromolar (μM) concentrations. The fluorescence emission
spectrum of Nor–Chl–Py–Btn in water showed three
characteristic monomer emission peaks at 375, 397, and 417 nm and
a featureless emission peak at 475 nm. The emission at 475 nm was
attributed to the excimer emission of Py, which clearly indicated
a strong interaction of the Py moiety in the excited state due to
the constrained structure of the Nor backbone.25 Also, the emission under aqueous conditions established
the hydrophobic core and PEG at the corona (Figure 5).

Release
Study
After proving the aggregation
behavior of this unique copolymer, the release profile of the Nor–Chl–Py–Btn
nanoaggregate was tested by dialysis studies (Figure 6).13 A dialysis
bag containing a water solution of the final copolymer (5 mg/mL) was
placed in a 50 mL beaker. The solution of the copolymer (Nor–Chl–Py–Btn)
was dialyzed against a phosphate-buffered saline/acetonitrile27 (95:5) mixture (pH = 5.5) to mimic the cancer
cell pH. The absorbance of the buffer was measured at different time
intervals up to 24 h.

Figure 6 (a) UV absorption measurements
of Nor–Chl–Py–Btn,
with pH 5.5, at varying time intervals. (b) Release study of Nor–Chl–Py–Btn
at pH’s 7.4 and 5.5.

The absorbance at 306 nm corresponded
to Chl, whereas the absorbances at 282, 317, 333, and 352 nm were
due to 4-(1-pyrenyl) butyric acid. The release study was performed
for 24 h. It was interesting to note that at pH 5.5, Chl release was
68%, whereas the release of 4-(1-pyrenyl) butyric acid was 65% (Figure 6b). As the release
kinetics of both 4-(1-pyrenyl) butyric acid and Chl were almost the
same, we envisioned that the release profile at the cellular level
could be easily observed by measuring the Py intensity.18 Finally, biocompatibility and cell viability
studies of the newly developed nanoaggregate system were conducted.

Biological Studies
To reveal the
importance of the Nor–Chl–Py–Btn nanoaggregate,
three cell lines were considered: HeLa wild-type (wt) cells (human
cervical cancer cell line), HEK 293 cells (human embryonic kidney
cells), and MCF 7 cells (human breast cancer cell line). The cells were
maintained in minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine
serum, penicillium (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100 μg/mL)
and were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 environment
according to the ATCC recommendations. The cytotoxicity of the Nor–Chl–Py–Btn
nanoaggregate on HeLa wt and HEK 293 cells was assessed by the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay. A fresh solution of MTT (20 μL) was added
to each well, followed by incubation for 4 h in 5% CO2 at
37 °C.

From the cyctotoxicity assay, it was clear that
in the Btn receptor-positive (BR +ve) HeLa wt cells Nor–Chl–Py–Btn
was more toxic than Chl (Figure 7c). Interestingly, the same experiment with HEK 293
cells, which are Btn receptor-negative (BR −ve), revealed that
the cytotoxicity was more for Chl than that for Nor–Chl–Py–Btn
(Figure 7a). A comparative
statistical analysis of the cytotoxicity assay results clearly described
that Nor–Chl–Py–Btn was better in the case of
HeLa wt (BR +ve) cells than in the case of HEK 293 (BR −ve)
cells (Figure 7b,d).
It also revealed that the Nor–Chl–Py–Btn nanoaggregate
was not toxic to normal cell lines (HEK 293), as in the case of Chl
(Figure 7b,d). This
clearly suggested the importance of our design. The results also emphasized
the importance of receptor-assisted internalization of the nanoaggregates.
The cytotoxicity of the copolymer without drug was tested in three
different cell lines (HEK 293, HeLa wt, MCF 7); it did not show a
cytotoxic effect toward any of the cell lines, which confirms that
the cytotoxic effect was due to the chemotherapeutic agent Chl (Figure S15). To confirm the site-specific nature
of the nanoaggregate, the cytotoxicity toward another Btn receptor-positive
cell line (MCF 7) was tested. It is clear that the nanoaggregate shows
high toxicity toward MCF 7 cell lines as like HeLa wt (Btn-positive)
compare to HEK 293 (Btn-negative), which further confirms the site-specific
nature of our nanoaggregate (Figure S13).

assay and statistical analysis of
Nor–Chl–Py–Btn and Chl in the HEK 293 cell line.
(c, d) Cell viability assay and statistical analysis of Chl and Nor–Chl–Py–Btn

An epifluorescence microscope was used to track Py emission
in Nor–Chl–Py–Btn. As observed
in Figure 8b, nanoaggregates
incubated with HeLa wt cells showed an obviously higher fluorescence
intensity than those incubated with HEK 293 cells at a given time
and a 100 μg/mL concentration. This obvious high fluorescent
intensity was due to Btn-assisted internalization. To further confirm
the receptor-mediated internalization, a cellular uptake study of
another Btn-positive cell line (MCF 7) was performed. High internalization
of the nanoaggregate in MCF 7 (human breast cancer cell line) was
observed, which further confirms the site-specific nature of the nanoaggregate
(Figure S14).

(b) Live-cell images of the cellular uptake at different time intervals
in the HEK 293 and HeLa wt cell lines (Videos 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the Supporting Information).
(c) Comparative bar-diagram analysis of the flow cytometry results
of the Nor–Chl–Py–Btn nanoaggregate in the HEK
293 and HeLa wt cell lines.

As the cells were not
stained with DAPI, the observed blue expression under the epifluorescence
microscope was only from the Py motifs. This clearly suggested the
significance of our design. As both Chl and Py were linked to the
polymer via an ester backbone, their release kinetics as well as concentrations
could be directly related (Figure 6). From the epifluorescence microscope live-cell image
analysis, it was observed that the intensity of the HEK 293 cell line
was less than that of the HeLa wt cell line. It was very
clear from the results for the HeLa wt cell line that the intensity
was very prominent because of the BR +ve nature of this cell line, that clearly confirmed the greater internalization of the nanoaggregates into HeLa wt cell line was due to the presence of btn receptor. Flow cytometry
results revealed that the fold change in the HeLa wt (BR +ve) cell
line was 2.33 and 3.58 times higher at 50 and 100 μg/mL concentrations,
respectively, than that in the HEK 293 cell line (BR −ve) (Figures 8c and 9). From the above cell viability assay, epifluorescence microscope
analysis, and flow cytometry results, it clearly established that
the Nor–Chl–Py–Btn nanoaggregate is a potential
site-specific theranostic agent for the purpose of drug delivery as
well as imaging.

Conclusions
In conclusion, with the ability to provide concurrent therapy and
fluorescence imaging, the Nor–Chl–Py–Btn nanoaggregate
has great potential and applicability in the field of medicine as
a nanotheranostic agent. Compared to physical encapsulation, chemical
conjugation of both the drug and imaging motif with the same linker
helps track the nonfluorescent drug in cell in vitro studies. The inclusion of Btn motif to the polymeric backbone results in enhanced tumor accumulation
due to the site-specific nature. We envision that the newly designed
nanotheranostic agent, nanoaggregate Nor–Chl–Py–Btn,
has potential application in personalized treatment via simultaneous
treatment and monitoring.

Polymerization Procedure
After successful synthesis
of the monomers, the homopolymerization conditions were explored.
To assess the livingness of the monomers
(Mono’s 1–3), different amounts
of Grubbs’ second-generation catalyst were added to each monomer
dissolved in anhydrous dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and stirred under a nitrogen atmosphere for 1 h, for Mono’s
1 and 2, or 6 h, for Mono 3. The
polymerization reaction was carried out inside a glove box. After
completion of the reaction, an aliquot was taken out for GPC analysis,
and the remaining portion was quenched with ethyl vinyl ether and
precipitated from diethyl ether three times. The different molecular
weights of the homopolymers of all three monomers were measured by
the GPC technique and plotted against M/I (Figure 2a).
