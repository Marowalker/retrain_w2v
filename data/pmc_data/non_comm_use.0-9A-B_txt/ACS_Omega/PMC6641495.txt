Pectin-g-(sodium acrylate-co-3-(N-isopropylacrylamido) sodium propanoate-co-N-isopropylacrylamide) interpenetrating polymer
networks (PANIPNs) were synthesized through systematic multistage
optimization of equilibrium swelling ratio by response surface methodology
for individual and/or synergistic removal(s) of cationic safranine
(SF), anionic methyl orange, and M(II/III), such as Hg(II), Cd(II),
and Cr(III). The relative effects of copolymer compositions on ligand-selective
adsorption, strong/weak H-bonds, thermal stabilities, crystallinity,
surface properties, swelling abilities, cross-link densities, network
parameters, hydrophilic–hydrophobic characteristics, and adsorption
capacities (ACs) were measured through extensive microstructural analyses
of adsorbed
and/or unadsorbed PANIPN41 and PANIPN21 bearing sodium acrylate and N-isopropylacrylamide (SA/NIPAm) in 4:1 and 2:1 ratios,
respectively, using Fourier transform infrared, 1H and 13C NMR, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thermogravimetric
analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, scanning
electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, along
with measuring lower critical solution temperature, % gel content
(% GC), % −COOH, and pHPZC. Extensive UV–vis
measurements were carried out at varying copolymer compositions, initial
pH (pHi), and dyes, interpreted considering
monomer–dimer and azonium–ammonium equilibrium of dye,
dye–dye complexation, ligand-selective PANIPNs–dye adduct
formation, π–π stacking interactions, and orientation
effect of dyes. Thermodynamically feasible chemisorption processes
showed the maximum ACs of 127.61, 96.78, 103.36, and 99.41 mg g–1 for SF, Hg(II), Cd(II), and Cr(III), respectively,
under optimum conditions.

1 Introduction
Hydrogels
possess the unique ability to imbibe a large amount of
water without loss of structure owing to the H-bonding and electrostatic/covalent
interactions. Depending on the use of different extent of ingredients,
temperatures, and methods of synthesis, relative proportions of several
hydrophilic functional groups demonstrate diversified swelling behaviors.1 Although hydrogels of synthetic polymers have
adequate mechanical strengths, yet these suffer from poor biodegradability.
Conversely, natural polymer-based hydrogels exhibit better biodegradability
but lack mechanical strengths. However, the attainment of optimum
balance between mechanical properties and biodegradability is possible
via synthesizing interpenetrating polymer network (IPN)-based hydrogels
comprising a homo-/co-/terpolymer, synthesized through polymerizing
one or two synthetic monomer(s) with a natural polymer.2 Synthetic hydrogels find extensive applications
as superadsorbents in tissues, ion exchangers, size exclusion chromatography,
membrane-based applications, catheters, and contact lenses. Recently,
hydrogels were used as biosensors for glucose, bile acids, and human
metabolites, such as uric acid, cholesterol, and triglycerides. Currently,
self-healing hydrogels, especially magnetic hydrogels, are under the
utmost consideration for drug delivery and separation, image enhancement,
and remote-controlled actuators and valves. In this context, Fe(II)-
and Fe(III)-grafted poly(2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propansulfonic acid-co-vinylimidazole),3,4 carboxymethyl starch-g-polyvinyl imidazole/poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/Fe3O4 mixture,5 Fe3O4-poly(l-cysteine/2-hydroxyethyl acrylate) (Fe3O4-p(Cys/HEA)),6 carboxymethyl-β-cyclodextrin
polymer-modified Fe3O4 nanoparticles,7 Fe3O4 nanoparticle-coated
polyacrylic acid,8 PVA-based nanocomposites,9 and PVA/chitosan/agar–agar tri-polymer-based
magnetic nanohydrogels10 have been examined
for the adsorptive exclusion of toxic dyes/metal ions. Moreover, biocompatible
hydrogels are used as injectable cell therapy carriers and scaffolding
materials for cartilage tissue engineering. Polyacrylic acid (PAA)-based
hydrogels have been effectively used for drug delivery to specific
regions of the gastrointestinal tract, in particular, for the colon-specific
delivery of low-molecular-weight protein drugs. However, poor thermal
and mechanical stabilities and high water solubility limit the usability
of the PAA hydrogels. Moreover, the thermosensitive poly-NIPAm (PNIPAm)
hydrogels have found diverse applications for making biosensors and
contact lenses, drug delivery, and cell sheet engineering. The utilization
of such hydrogels is limited because of the slow response rate and
poor mechanical properties.

Pectin (PN), an anionic polysaccharide,
is composed of poly(1,4-galacturonic
acid) as a 3-fold helix, linked together by 1 → 4 glycosidic
linkages. PN consists of two regions: (a) a smooth region, a linear
chain of (1–4) linked α-d-galacturonic acid,
and (b) a hairy region, containing galacturonic acid with or without
rhamnose as the main chain and substituted by neutral sugars.11 The relative proportion of both the regions
depends on the botanical source of PN and type of extraction. PN finds
immense applications in food industries and biomedical fields.12

Response surface methodology (RSM) is
widely used for analyzing
synergistic effects of process variables on response(s) to physical/chemical
studies through the minimum number of experimental runs. However,
few studies have been devoted for RSM-based optimization of operational
variables during adsorption for attaining the maximum adsorption capacity
(AC).13,14 In the present study, RSM has been employed
for systematic multistage optimization of variables for synthesis
of a hydrogel possessing the maximum equilibrium swelling ratio (ESR).

The presence of toxic dyes/pigments and metal ions (M(II/III))
beyond the tolerance limit in the effluents of cosmetic, leather,
pharmaceutical, food, textile, paper,
plastic, plating, and mining industries are severely detrimental for
the ecosystem and environment. In fact, such industries use more than
10 000 dissimilar nonbiodegradable aromatic synthetic dyes
for conquering, intensifying, and maintaining the color of products,
of which around 15 wt % of these are discharged as wastes.13 Among several popular synthetic dyes, safranine
(SF) is one of the most extensively used dyes for dyeing natural fibers.
SF is frequently used for dyeing wool, silk, and acrylic fibers and
leather. SF poisoning may cause carcinogenicity, mitochondrial toxicity,
mutagenicity, and nucleic acid damage.15 The possible oxidation of Cr(III) to Cr(VI) causes toxicity via
carcinogenicity and/or mutagenicity, skin ulceration, liver damage,
pulmonary congestion, and many other health problems. The toxicity
of Cd(II) includes high blood pressure, renal dysfunction, lung cancer,
destruction of red blood cell, and anemia. Hg(II), one of the most
toxic heavy metal ions, can damage
brain, nervous system, endocrine system, and other organs of human
body. Elimination of such contaminants through an ecofriendly waste
management system is gaining high insight.

Although the use
of different hydrogels, such as homo-/co-/terpolymers16,17 and IPN1,2-based polymers is available in the literature
for the adsorptive removal of dyes and M(II/III), unorthodox synthesis
of natural polymer-grafted-terpolymer IPN hydrogels through in situ
strategic attachment of a third monomer using optimized compositions
of SA/NIPAm, temperature, and other ingredients, appearance of several
physicochemical effects during synergistic removals of structurally
distinct dyes and extensive characterization of loaded and/or unloaded
hydrogel(s) to understand the changes in physicochemical properties
of PANIPNs of varying copolymer compositions is comprehensively reported.
In addition, the relative effects of varied copolymer compositions
of PANIPNs on diversified interactions between M(II/III) and N- or
O-donor ligands, such as −COO–, −COOH,
and −CONH–, resulting in the formation of different
coordinate and/or ionic bond(s) and, hence, varied ACs have thoroughly
been investigated.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
Na2HPO4, Na2B4O7·10H2O,
HCl, acrylic acid, NIPAm, PN (degree of esterification = 63–66%), N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide (MBA),
potassium persulfate (PPS), and sodium bisulfite (SBS) of analytical
grades were purchased from Merck and used without any further modification.
SF, methyl orange (MO), and nitrate salts of Cd(II), Hg(II), and Cr(III),
used in adsorption studies, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

2.2 Synthesis of Hydrogels
PANIPNs were
synthesized through free radical solution polymerization of SA and
NIPAm (Scheme 1) using
PPS and SBS as redox initiators and MBA as a cross-linker in a N2 atmosphere. The exact composition of ingredients and reaction
temperature were optimized by RSM. In fact, two PANIPNs, one possessing
the optimum composition of monomers (i.e., PANIPN41, SA/NIPAm = 4:1)
and the other involving the 2-fold variation of SA/NIPAm (i.e., PANIPN21,
SA/NIPAm = 2:1), were chosen for the comparative studies. Initially,
a three-neck reactor was placed on a magnetic stirrer cum hot plate,
followed by the gradual addition of 0.5 g of PN in 30 mL of water,
0.20/0.16 mol of SA in 27 mL of water at pHi = 5.5 and
0.05/0.08 mol of NIPAm in 25 mL of water with constant stirring at
300 rpm for synthesizing PANIPNs. Thereafter, 0.15 mmol of MBA solution
in 8 mL of water was added at a constant temperature of 293 K and
the resultant solution was kept stirring for 6 h for homogenization
and then for another 2 h after purging N2 gas. After that,
a solution mixture of PPS and SBS (i.e., 0.74 and 1.92 mmol in 10
mL of water) was added to initiate polymerization (Scheme 2). The as-prepared PANIPNs
were washed several times with 1:3 methanol/water solutions for complete
removal of unreacted components and water-soluble oligomers. Finally,
PANIPNs were air dried for 3 days, followed by drying under vacuum
for another 3 days at 323 K.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Experimental Design and Model Development
for the Synthesis of PANIPN
The ESR of a hydrogel depends
on several synthesis parameters, such as SA (wt %, A), initiator (wt %, B), PN (wt %, C), MBA (wt %, D), pHi (−, E), and temperature (K, F), individually
or synergistically. The hydrogel having the maximum ESR was synthesized
using optimum conditions of such variables via executing the minimum
number of studies, obtained through two-factor interactions (2FI)
between the variables. A fractional factorial design (Resolution-IV)
was employed to filter the variable, imparting the most significant
effect on ESR. Finally, such significant variables were optimized
using central composite design (CCD) analysis.

3.1.1 Phase-1:
Screening of Significant Variables
of Synthesis
In phase-1, screening of variables was executed
through nineteen experiments using Resolution-IV design (Table S1). The maximum/minimum levels were considered
to be 66.67/95.24 wt %, 1.00/4.00 wt %, 0.10/0.50 wt %, and 0.10/0.40
wt %, 4.00/12.00, and 303/323 K for A, B, C, D, E, and F, respectively, for ESR within 129–225.75. However, A, B, E, AB, AD, and CF crossed the Bonferroni
limit of 3.7283 in the Pareto chart (Figure S1). Thus, these six significant terms were considered for building
the regression model. However, the adequacy of this model was evaluated
through the following second-order polynomial equation 1  Indeed, the
chosen model was considered to
be highly significant because of close resemblance of Adj. and Pred. R2 (i.e., 0.9804/0.9713), very high Adj. R2 (i.e., 0.9804), and very low p-value (<0.0001) (Table S2). The individual
effect of the significant variables was noted to be positive, whereas
only AB imparted the antagonism effect among AB, AD, and CF. However,
the optimum A, B, and E for attaining
the maximum ESR of 225.75 were 95.24 wt %, 4.00 wt %, and 12, respectively.

3.1.2 Phase-2: CCD Optimization of the Three Most
Significant Variables of Synthesis
The CCD was adopted for
optimizing the three most significant process variables of synthesis,
i.e., A, B, and E, considering the individual and interactive effects on the response,
i.e., ESR. In fact, the ESRs of such analyses were scrutinized and
interlinked with input variables for optimization through empirical
second-order polynomial eq 2. 2  Here, Y, β0, βi, βii, and βij represent the predicted
response, constant, linear, quadratic, and interaction coefficients,
respectively. The adequacy of the predicted model was justified by
ANOVA (Table S4), taking A, B, and E within 66.67–95.24
wt %, 2.00–4.00 wt %, and 5–10, respectively. The process
variables and software-generated responses are listed in Table S3. In addition, sequential model sum of
squares (type I) and model summary statistics tests were conducted
for rational understanding of interactive effects of A, B, and E on the response via
linear, 2FI, quadratic, and cubic models. However, the quadratic model
was found to be the best because of higher Adj. R2 and finer correspondence between Adj. and Pred. R2. In this context, swelling data were fitted
to eq 2 to obtain eq 3. 3  The response surface plots (Figure 1a–c) showed
the interactive
effects among BA, EA, and EB. The numerical optimization section, in which A, B, and E were kept
in range and ESR became maximize, A, B, and E were found to be 84.43 wt %, 2.97 wt %,
and 10, respectively.

SA (wt %, A), and (c) pHi (−, E) and amount of initiator (wt %, B).

3.2 Swelling
and pH/Temperature Reversibility
Studies of PANIPNs
Hydrogels exhibit diversified swelling
behaviors because of variation in hydrophilic functional groups, originated
from different extents of added ingredients, temperatures, and methods
of synthesis. At pHi > pHPZC, the repulsive
force between −COO– groups caused an enhancement
of chain relaxation. Moreover, the presence of relatively higher number
of mobile counterions in the PANIPN network resulted in a higher osmotic
pressure for better swelling. In fact, reverse effects were produced
at pHi < pHPZC as a result of extensive protonation
of −COO–. Thus, a relatively higher ESR of
PANIPN41 and the respective terpolymer could be realized by the presence
of a higher amount of hydrophilic SA (Figure S2a–f). Furthermore, the thermoresponsive nature of hydrogels was controlled
via relative variations of hydrophilic to hydrophobic moieties, and
they showed
better swelling below the lower critical solution temperature (LCST)
because of the better population of stronger H-bonds (Figure S2g). Again, the grafting of hydrophilic
PN within the terpolymer network caused an enhanced swelling as well
as chain flexibility, reflected via retention of structural integrity
even after the completion of six swelling–deswelling cycles
(Figure S2a,b).

3.3 Fourier
Transform Infrared (FTIR) Analyses
of Unloaded and SF/M(II/III)-Loaded PANIPNs
Grafting of PN
with TerP41 and thereby formation of an ether linkage of type >CH–O–CH2– in PANIPN41 were confirmed from the appearance of
new peaks at 1458 and 2855 cm–1 for −CH2– deformation and symmetric −CH2–
str. of −O–CH2– in >CH–O–CH2–. Moreover, such C–O–C bond formation
during grafting through free radical polymerization of PN and C=C
of SA/NIPAm/MBA and formation of at least monobranched matrices was
substantiated by the appearance of new skeletal vibration peaks at
473 (medium), 460 (weak), and 453 cm–1.18 Indeed, grafting-related structural alterations
were also manifested from the conversion of PN-specific α-1,4-
to β-1,4-glycosidic linkage in PANIPN41 (Table S6), along with the appearance of β-d-glucose peak at 874 cm–1 in PANIPN41. In fact,
the grafting-related transformation of α-1,4- to β-1,4
glycosidic linkages in PANIPN41 was also corroborated from the absence
of equatorial anomeric hydrogen-specific peaks within 825–860
cm–1 in PANIPN41. In addition, grafting and associated
intimate interactions between PN and TerP41 were apprehended from
the loss of several PN-specific peaks in PANIPN41 (Figure S3a and Table S6). Accordingly, significant changeover
in stronger-/weaker-type H-bonding and associated changes in the H-bonding
environment around NIPAm could be correlated with the alteration in
NIPAm-specific doublet peaks for PANIPN41 and the increase in N–C=O
in-plane bending vibration from 661 cm–1 of TerP41
to 669 cm–1 in PANIPN41.19 For M(II/III)-PANIPN41, the formation of M(II/III)–N and
M(III)–O bonds, the
relative variation of mutual O–H/N–H H-bonding, and
several kinds of microstructural alterations are provided in the Supporting Information of the article (Page:
S12–S15).

From 1H NMR, incorporation of
NIPAm within TerP21 was ascertained from the appearance of characteristic
peaks of −CH3 and −CH– at 1.25 and 4.18 ppm, respectively. However, such peaks
were appeared at 1.21 and 4.04 ppm in PANIPN21 (Figure 2a,b). Moreover, the presence of peaks specific
to −CH2– of MBA at 4.31 and
4.24 ppm in TerP21 and PANIPN21, respectively, confirmed the cross-linking
by MBA (Figure 2a,b).20 In addition, the formation of −C(sp3)–C(sp3)– from C=C of SA,
NIPAm, and MBA was inferred from the absence of olefinic proton-specific
peaks at 6.03, 6.23, and 6.59 ppm of SA, 5.60 and 6.22 ppm of NIPAm,
and 5.59 and 6.13 ppm of MBA. However, the symbolic peaks within 0.83–1.58
and 1.96–2.65 ppm confirmed the formation of −CH2– and >CH–, respectively,
in TerP21, whereas such peaks appeared within 0.84–1.54 and
2.04–2.92 ppm in PANIPN.21 The presence
of moieties of type −CH2–N(CHMe2)–CO–, generated via chain propagation between −CON(CHMe2)• of NIPAm and SA, was determined from
the appearance of new broad peaks within 3.49–3.53 and 3.40–3.69
ppm in TerP21 and PANIPN21, respectively. The characteristic N–H peaks of NIPAm/MBA appeared at 6.91, 6.98, 7.51, 7.60, and
7.70 in TerP21 and at 6.87 and 7.57 ppm in PANIPN21. In addition,
PANIPN21 also showed PN-specific peaks at 5.22 and 5.08 ppm. In this
context, the characteristic peaks of PN at 5.14/3.83/5.02 and 3.72
ppm were attributed to the H1/H3/H5 ring protons of galacturonic acid (GalA) and −COOCH3 of methyl galacturonate, respectively (Figure S4a). Indeed, the δ of GalA ring
protons were affected by the variegated arrangements of esterified
(E) and nonesterified (G) GalA units in PN, realized from the H5-specific δ within 4.71–4.79 ppm for GGG-,
EGG-, GGE-, or EGE-type arrangements. The characteristic H4 peaks appeared at 4.37 and 4.46 ppm for GG and EE or EG arrangements,
respectively.22 However, residual peaks
of PN moieties were appeared within 3.50–3.61 ppm.22

The peaks at 186.20 and 192.10 ppm of
TerP21 and 185.71 and 194.42
ppm of PANIPN21 were assigned to −COOH/–COO– of PANIPNs (Figure 2d,e). The presence of different types of
amides (−CONH−) was confirmed by the appearance
of peaks within 176.50–179.40 and 176.48–179.98 ppm
in TerP21 and PANIPN21, respectively. The free radical polymerization
and cross-linking were inferred from the absence of olefinic carbon
peaks at 127.87/132.97, 125.49/131.30, and 125.53/130.88 ppm of SA,
NIPAm, and MBA, respectively, in TerP21/PANIPN21.

The prevalent
sharp peaks at 23.90 and 23.94 ppm in TerP21 and
PANIPN21, respectively, assigned to the −(CH3)2 fragment of NIPAm, inferred the incorporation
of NIPAm in both networks. Moreover, the peaks of –CH–
of NIPAm, −CH2– of MBA, −CH(COOH), −CH(COO–),
−CHCONHCHMe2, and −CH2N(CHMe2)CO– moieties broadened the
spectrum and appeared at 42.80 and 46.70 ppm (shoulder) in TerP21.
However, such peaks were appeared at 42.83 and 46.34 ppm in PANIPN21.
Additionally, several weak peaks at 165.71, 109.48, 104.61, 102.05,
and from 65.21 to 81.54 ppm in PANIPN21 inferred the presence of −COOCH3 of GalA, C1 of GalA, C1 of α-l-arabinose, C1 of α-d-galactose, C2 to C5 of GalA, and
rest of ring residues (esterified and nonesterified) of PN, respectively

From Table 1, the
coexistence of both −COO– and −COOH
in the unadsorbed PANIPN21 at pHi = 7.0 confirmed the presence
of O 1s peaks at 530.91/533.36 and 532.14 eV for C=O/O–H
of −COOH and −COO–, respectively (Figure 3c). In fact, the
BE of O 1s for −COO– was intermediate between
the BEs of O 1s for C=O and O–H of −COOH, which
reflected the mutual equivalence of both O-atoms of −COO– due to resonance stabilization. Moreover, the peak
at 540.16 eV was ascribed to the shake-up satellite band of the O
atom in the −CO–N(CHMe2)–CH2– segment of PANIPN21 because of the π–π*
transition. Among all of the M(II/III), preferential covalent interaction
between Hg(II) and N-donor ligands over O-donors of PANIPN21 was realized
from the significant lowering of the N 1s BE from 399.70 to 398.70
eV (Figure 3e). Indeed,
such substantial lowering in BE of N 1s was attributed to the appearance
of the amido-Hg covalent bond, in which Hg(II) shared electron clouds
with the amidic N.28 Additionally, formation
of ionic/coordinate bonds between Hg(II) and N-donor ligands was also
rationalized from the significant increase in BE of N 1s from 399.782
to 404.23 eV and the decrease in BEs of Hg 4f7/2/Hg 4f5/2 from 102.58/106.68 to 101.76/104.72 eV (Figure 3g).29 In this regard, the O 1s peak for C=O of −COOH at
531.19 did not change significantly (Figure 3f), whereas the other two peaks increased
significantly. However, none of these O 1s peaks were shifted significantly
as compared to those of N 1s. Such findings again confirmed the preferential
and intimate interaction of Hg(II) with N-donor over O-donor ligands.
In this regard, considerable changes were also registered in all of
the C 1s peaks (Figure 3d), reflecting the prevalence of coordinate/covalent bonds in Hg(II)-PANIPN21
rather than ionic interactions.

In contrast to other M(II/III),
Cd(II), possessing full-filled
d subshells, preferably interacted with PANIPN21 via ionic bonds,
as evidenced from the characteristic XPS peak of Cd 3d5/2 at 406.27 eV (Figure 3k). However, chelating interaction via coordination was also apprehended
from the appearance of the peak at 404.75 eV (Figure 3k), indicating the formation of (−COO)2Cd within Cd(II)-PANIPN21. Theoretically, it is believed that
Cd(II), having full-filled d subshells, preferentially occupies the
ionic environment rather than the coordination sphere. In this regard,
predominantly, the ionic interaction between Cd(II) and PANIPN21 was
also realized from the minimal shift of the characteristic peaks of
N 1s and O 1s (Figure 3i,j). Moreover, lesser coordinating tendency of Cd(II) was further
emphasized from the marginal change in BEs of the C 1s spectrum (Figure 3h).

In contrast
to Hg(II), the privileged binding affinity of Cr(III)
with N-donors was mainly of ionic type, as apprehended from the marginal
increase in the N 1s peak from 399.70 to 399.91 eV (Figure 3m) (Table 1). However, the intimate coordinate bonding
between the O-donor and Cr(III) was realized from the significant
increase in all O 1s peaks (Figure 3n), especially peaks of −COO– and O–H of −COOH (Table 1), and the lowering in BE from 587.00 of
Cr(NO3)3 to 585.53 eV of Cr(III)-PANIPN21 (Figure 3o). However, such
significant interaction of Cr(III) with O-donor ligands resulted in
the marginal shifts of all C 1s peaks (Figure 3l).

3.6 Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) of Unloaded
and SF/M(II/III)-Loaded PANIPNs
From Figure 4a,b, it is clear that grafting of PN enhanced
the thermal stability of TerP41, whereas relatively destabilized grafting
was noted for PANIPN21 because of considerable lowering of heat-resistant
cross-links. For Hg(II)-PANIPN41, the drastic two-step thermal degradation,
within 160.13–229.80 and 229.80–315.32 °C, was
associated with the mass losses of 45 and 36 wt %, respectively, followed
by a gradual loss of up to 800 °C. However, Hg(II)-PANIPN21,
comprising a relatively higher amount of NIPAm, showed substantially
improved thermal resistance than Hg(II)-PANIPN41. The two-step thermal
degradation of Hg(II)-PANIPN21, within 160.97–227.30 and 227.30–314.64
°C, was associated with mass losses of 39 and 37 wt %, respectively.

Figure 4 TGA of
(a) TerP21 and PANIPN21 and SF-, Hg(II)-, Cd(II)-, and Cr(III)-PANIPN21
and (b) TerP41 and PANIPN41 and SF-, Hg(II)-, Cd(II)-, and Cr(III)-PANIPN41.

Because the preferential interaction
of Hg(II) with amides of PANIPNs
led to the formation of Hg–N covalent bonds, inferred from
FTIR and XPS analyses (Figures S3 and 3e), the two-stage drastic degradation of Hg(II)-PANIPNs
could also be related to the possible breakdown of strong bonds, including
amides from Hg(II)-PANIPNs, via reactive sublimation of the intermediates
and subsequent evaporation of Hg, especially in PANIPN41.31−33 In fact, among all of the M(II/III)-adsorbed hydrogels, the highest
residue of Cd(II)-PANIPNs could be attributed to the slowest evaporation
rate of metallic Cd, especially above 800 °C.31,32 In fact, both Cd(II) and Cr(III) preferably interacted with −COO– than −CONH– and, hence, the thermal
degradation of NIPAm moieties at 400 °C induced a moderate effect
on the thermal degradation of Cd(II)-PANIPN41 (i.e., 23 wt % within
400–500 °C). However, rapid degradation of Cr(III)-PANIPN41
(i.e., 36 wt % within 400–500 °C) was noted to be more
intense after the thermal decomposition of NIPAm moieties at 400 °C.
The lowering in the available number of −COO– in PANIPN21 resulted in the formation of lower residues for both
Cd(II)- and Cr(III)-PANIPN21, indicating the reduction of adsorption
for Cd(II)-/Cr(III)-PANIPN21. As the extent of metallic residue (i.e.,
33.72 wt %) of Cd(II)-PANIPNs was appreciably higher than that of
Cr(III)-PANIPNs (i.e., 32.63 wt %), the AC of Cd(II)-PANIPNs was noted
to be higher than that of Cr(III)-PANIPNs. In fact, the lower extent
of prevalent −COO– in PANIPN21 envisaged
the lowering of O-donor ligands in PANIPN21.

From Figure 4a,
better thermal stability of SF-PANIPN21 than that of PANIPN21 within
150–230 °C could be attributed mostly to the formation
of stronger H-bonds, as envisaged in the respective FTIR spectra (Figure S3b). Conversely, the initial thermal
stability within 150–350 °C of PANIPN41 was found to be
deteriorated extensively in SF-PANIPN41 via predominant ionic interactions
(Figure 4b). However,
SF-PANIPN41 produced lower residue as compared with the unloaded hydrogels.
The residue was markedly lower for SF-PANIPN21 (i.e., 0.02 wt %) than
for SF-PANIPN41 (i.e., 25.91 wt %), indicating the formation of better
temperature-resistant ash during thermal degradation of SF-PANIPN41.
In fact, extensive electrovalent bond formation between SF cations
and polyanions of PANIPN41 resulted in improved thermal stability
of SF-PANIPN41 over PANIPN41 within 380–570 °C. In the
intermediate stage, especially within 340–430 °C, the
inferior thermal stability of SF-PANIPN21 as compared to that of PANIPN21
could be ascribed to the thermal decomposition of thermally susceptible
secondary amide containing NIPAm moieties. Finally, the rapid thermal
decomposition beyond 450 °C was attributed to main chain splitting
because of the lowering of the electrovalent interactions between
adsorbed SF cations and polyanions of PANIPN21.

3.7 Differential Scanning Calorimetry of Unloaded
and SF/M(II/III)-Loaded PANIPNs
From Figure S5a,b, manifold increase in the intensity of the exothermic
peak of Hg-PANIPN21 than that of Hg-PANIPN41 was ascribed to the relative
enhancement of the displacement reaction between higher amount of
adsorbed Hg(II) in Hg-PANIPN21 and Al-pan. In addition, appearance
of two small and broad endothermic peaks at 218 and 262 °C could
be related to the formation of new phases via metal chelation.2 Notably, an intense peak at 371 °C for PANIPN41,
related to the natural ordering of the PN-grafted terpolymer, disappeared
in the thermogram of PANIPN21. Moreover, the pronounced alteration
of peak from 371 to 330, 412, and 425 °C for Hg-PANIPN41, Cr-PANIPN41,
and Cd-PANIPN41, respectively, could be linked with the structural
changes, induced by variegated interactions. The peaks at 323 and
329 °C in Hg-PANIPN21 indicated the relatively higher extent
of crystalline phases as Hg(II) interacted strongly with the increasing
number of available NIPAm moieties within PANIPN21 (Figure S5a). The less intense peaks at 411 and 416 °C
for Cr(III)-PANIPN21 and Cd(II)-PANIPN21, respectively, were lower
than the peaks at 412 and 425 °C of Cr(III)-PANIPN41 and Cd(II)-PANIPN41,
respectively, indicating the preferential binding of both Cr(III)
and Cd(II) with −COO– rather than with the
amides of NIPAm moieties.

3.8 X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
of Unloaded and SF/M(II/III)-Loaded
PANIPNs
From respective XRD spectra (Figure S5c), the increase in crystallinity of PANIPNs compared
to that of TerPs could be apprehended from the extent of intermixing
of phases via intercalation of the grafted PN through the TerP network.
Several characteristic peaks at 20.40, 21.72, 29.91, and 45.24°
of Hg(II)-PANIPNs indicated the presence of 001, 110, 111, and, 102
planes, related to the deposition of HgNH2Cl- and HgCl2-type crystals on the Hg(II)-PANIPNs surface. Conversely,
a slightly closer packing in Cr(III)-PANIPN21 compared to that in
Cr(III)-PANIPN41 could be apprehended by the shift of 2θ from
20.21 to 20.90. In contrast, adsorption of Cd(II) resulted in relative
lowering of the crystalline domain at the hydrogel surface because
of percolation of smaller hydrated Cd(II) in the bulk of PANIPN (Figure S5c,d). The XRD spectra of SF-PANIPN21
produced three distinct peaks at 32.06, 45.75, and 56.78° (Figure S5c), along with the disappearance of
the characteristic PANIPN21 peak at 20.71°, reflecting the appearance
of a new crystalline phase at the surface of SF-PANIPN21 as compared
with PANIPN21. In contrast, the absence of any symbolic peak in both
PANIPN41 and SF-PANIPN41 indicated retention of amorphous characteristics
at the PANIPN41 surface even after the adsorption of SF. Moreover,
sharp and intense peaks at 32.06° with spacing = 2.88 Å
at n = 1 and at 45.75° with spacing = 1.99 Å
at n = 1 could be linked with the distance between
the carbon
atoms, located at the opposite vertices of benzene hexagons of SF,
and the spacing obtained from the XRD spectrum of liquid benzene (i.e.,
2.00 Å), respectively.34 In this regard,
diffusion of appreciable amount of stacks of rigid, flat, and relatively
hydrophobic SF into the bulk of PANIPN41 through the micropores than
the individual surface occupation could be realized by a higher number
of −COO– in PANIPN41.35 In contrast, fewer −COO– in PANIPN21
could attach lesser amount of SF cations and, hence, a substantial
amount of SF cations might be accumulated at the charge-compensated
hydrogel in the form of organized stacks via hydrophobic interactions.
In this context, the small peak at 56.78°, attributed to the
spacing of 4.86 Å for n = 3, envisaged the presence
of SF of dimension = 1.10 × 0.95 × 0.49 nm3 at
the SF-PANIPN21 surface.36

3.9 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy
Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) Analyses
As observed
from SEM photomicrographs, the bulk of PANIPNs was more porous than
the surface (Figure S6a,b). Notably, the
microporous surfaces of both Hg(II)-PANIPNs were populated with appreciably
bigger crystals of mercuric compounds along with the pores of various
dimensions (Figure S6c,d). Comparatively
smooth surfaces of PANIPNs were roughened in Cd(II)-PANIPNs (Figure S6e,f), more so in Cd(II)-PANIPN41, with
the generation of distinct folding and rough patches throughout the
surface (Figure S6e,f). Moreover, almost
all of the pores disappeared in Cd(II)-PANIPNs as a result of negligible
deposition of Cd(II), which eventually covered up the entire micro-,
meso-, and macropores of PANIPNs (Figure S6e,f). However, small particles of chromium compounds having indistinct
edges and visible pores of variegated sizes (Figure S6g,h) were scattered in both Cr(III)-PANIPNs. The surface
depositions of M(II/III) could also be evidenced from the appearance
of intense peaks in EDX spectra (Figure S6i–k).

3.10 Adsorption Isotherm, Kinetics, and Thermodynamics
Studies
The interaction between the adsorbate and adsorbent
during isothermal adsorption could be understood via fitting of the
experimental data with the adsorption isotherm models (eqs S11–S14). In the entire temperature
and concentration ranges, the Langmuir model fitted the best with
equilibrium adsorption data of SF and M(II/III) (Figures S7e–f and S8j–l). Ligand-selective adsorption
by PANIPNs could be justified from higher ACs of Cd(II), Cr(III),
and SF (Table 2) because
of the formation of predominant ionic bonds between −COO– of PANIPN41 and M(II/III)/–NH3+ of SF. In contrast, higher AC of Hg(II) onto PANIPN21 supported
better bonding with N-donors because NIPAm was in a higher extent
in PANIPN21. Again, the separation factor (RL) within 0–1 indicated favorable adsorption.

The closeness
of qe,exp and qe,cal and higher R2 and F (Table 2) indicated
better applicability of pseudosecond order
kinetics (eqs S15 and S16), supporting
the prevalence of chemisorption for SF and M(II/III) (Figures S7a–d and S8a–i). In fact,
the existence of chemisorption was also apprehended by the increasing
trend of k2 with the rise in temperature.
Again, higher k2 for Hg(II) onto PANIPN21
was related to the preferential formation of Hg–N bonds between
Hg(II) and N-donor-populated PANIPN21. In contrast, k2 values of Cr(III), Cd(II), and SF were higher for PANIPN41
because of greater ionic interactions with a higher number of −COO– in PANIPN41.

Thermodynamic spontaneity of adsorption
was justified from the
−ΔG0 values (eqs S17–S19) in entire concentration and
temperature ranges of the experiment (Table 3, Figures S8 and S9).13,37 The −ΔG0 values of SF, Cd(II), and Cr(III) were higher for PANIPN41
as compared to those for PANIPN21. However, higher −ΔG0 for Hg(II) onto PANIPN21 indicated the better
chemical attachment between Hg(II) and the N-donor of the NIPAm moiety.
The exothermic nature of adsorption was realized from negative ΔH0, whereas the positive ΔS0 (eq S19) indicated the fair
affinity of SF/M(II/III) for PANIPNs and decrease in randomness at
the solid–solution interface during adsorption. The activation
energies (Ea) of chemisorption were 21.78/20.16,
20.44/25.65, and 23.97/22.13 kJ mol–1 for Cd(II)-,
Hg(II)-, and Cr(III)-PANIPN41/21, respectively (Figure S10).2

3.11 Synergistic Adsorption of SF and MO on PANIPNs
at Different pHi and SF/MO Values
3.11.1 PANIPN41
In simultaneous removal
of SF–MO at pHi = 9, the extent of adsorption onto
PANIPN41 was enhanced with the increase in [SF]/[MO] (Figure 5a–d). Indeed, the characteristic
λmax values of SF and MO were merged together to
produce intermediate λmax within SF and MO, attributed
to the formation of SF–MO ionic adducts (Scheme 3a–d). The initial λmax was gradually red-shifted from 482 to 514 nm as [SF]/[MO] was increased
from 1:2 to 4:1 (Figure 5a–d). In fact, such a red shift in initial λmax of the binary mixture was directly dependent on the relative proportion
of SF in the mixture because the characteristic λmax of SF at 515 nm is higher than that of the MO anion at 465 nm. Moreover,
the initial λmax of all individual SF–MO combinations
was appreciably blue-shifted at the end of the adsorption process
(Figure 5a–d).
In fact, with the progress of adsorption, anionic MO was detached
from the solid phase via continuous breakdown of SF–MO ionic
adducts in the increasingly polar environment of the gradually diluted
binary mixture.

Figure 5 Synergistic removal of (a–d) SF–MO/pHi = 9/PANIPN41 and (e–h) SF–MO/pHi = 2/PANIPN41
(C0 = 30 ppm, T = 303
K, and adsorbent dose = 1 g L–1).

Scheme 3 Possible Structure of the MO–SF-PANIPN41 Adduct
(a–h)
at pHi 9 or 2 Involving Ionic Interaction between (I) SF
Dimer and MO, (II) SF Dimer and PANIPN41, (III) SF and PANIPN41, (IV)
SF and MO, (V) MO and the SA Moiety of PANIPN41, and (VI) MO and the
NIPAm Moiety of PANIPN41
Thus, SF cations, originated from SF–MO ionic adducts,
should
be adhered to polyanions of PANIPN41, leading to enhanced relative
population of MO anions in solution, resulting in the observed blue
shift of λmax in all of the combined visible spectra.
Furthermore, for a binary mixture having [SF]/[MO] = 4:1, a shoulder
peak at 460 nm emerged in the intermediate phase and disappeared completely
prior to the end of the adsorption process (Figure 5d). Such phenomenon could be related to the
preferential adsorption of SF cations by the polyanionic adsorbent,
accentuated by 4-fold numerical advantage of SF over MO. Moreover,
MO anions preferred to reside in the solution, envisaged from the
emergence of the shoulder peak at 460 nm. In the later stages, once
the nearly or completely neutralized polyanion-SF adduct was produced
via adsorption of SF cations on the polyanions of PANIPN41, MO anions
became capable to be attached with the polyanion-SF adducts, mostly
via nonionic interactions, leading to the disappearance of the characteristic
shoulder at 460 nm (Figure 5d).

At pHi = 2, the initial λmax of binary
solution, pertaining to all SF–MO combinations, appeared within
510–515 nm (Figure 5e–h). The visible peaks exhibited a blue shift with
respect to the initial λmax with the advancement
of adsorption. Notably, the extent of such shifting was found to be
directly proportional to the [SF]/[MO] ratio. Thus, the maximum blue
shift from 510 to 475 nm was attained for [SF]/[MO] of 1:2. Such a
radical hypsochromic shift of λmax might be attributed
to the formation of either strong ion-pairs or weak metachromic compound
(Scheme 3e–h),
assisted by the larger population of MO zwitterions in the mixture
(Figure 5e). In this
context, ammonium tautomers of MO were detected from the appearance
of a shoulder at 320 nm at a relatively higher concentration of MO
(Figure 5e). However,
the disappearance of such shoulder in the UV–vis spectra of
SF-populated binary mixtures could be realized in two ways: first,
through conversion of the ammonium tautomer (λmax = 320 nm) to the azonium tautomer (λmax = 510 nm),
followed by the adsorption of ammonium tautomer by PANIPN41. In this
context, the azonium tautomer appeared predominantly due to the conversion
of the ammonium tautomer to the resonance-stabilized azonium tautomer
in water or other polar solvent of low, acidic, pHi. Altogether,
a satisfactory level of adsorption of both MO and SF was demonstrated
in the acidic medium.

3.11.2 PANIPN21
At
alkaline pHi, gradual adsorption of SF onto PANIPN21 could
be envisaged from
the time-dependent hypochromic effect at 516 nm. However, the adsorption
of SF on PANIPN21 was noted to be incomplete as both of the characteristic
SF peaks were visible in the UV–vis spectra even after a reasonable
period of absorption. Interestingly, neither the symbolic peak of
the SF cation nor the characteristic peak of the MO anion was observed
in the combined UV–vis spectra of SF–MO. In fact, such
combined peak was noted to fluctuate in between the characteristic
peaks of SF and MO, ascribed to the ionic to weakly metachromic interactions
between cationic and anionic dyes (Scheme S1a–d). The initial λmax of the combined absorption spectra
was gradually red-shifted from 492 to 516 with the increase in [SF]/[MO]
ratios from 1:1 to 4:1 (Figure S11b–d). The characteristic initial λmax of the binary
mixture was found to depend directly on the relative proportion of
SF. However, in contrast to those for PANIPN41, the initial λmax (i.e., 512 nm) and
peak intensity were found to be unexpectedly higher for [SF]/[MO]
= 1:2, attributed to the formation of clusters/aggregates, consisting
of MO–SF ion pairs and excess MO anions (Figure S11a). However, the unusual red shift of λmax and the aggregate formation were not associated with adsorption
onto PANIPN41. In fact, greater availability of −COO– in PANIPN41 played the pivotal role in controlling the faster and
easier adsorption of SF cations that resulted in the lesser possibility
of bigger aggregate formation. Nevertheless, similar to those for
PANIPN41, the initial λmax values for all SF–MO
combinations were appreciably blue-shifted toward the characteristic
MO peak at the end of adsorption, suggesting the successive enhancement
of MO anions in the solution via breakdown of MO–SF ion pairs
in the continuously increasing polar environment via dilution. Altogether,
in comparison to PANIPN41, PANIPN21 was noted to be reluctant in adsorbing
the dyes, also apprehended from the poor overall time-dependent hypochromic
effect in the visible region.

At pHi = 2, a hyperchromic
effect followed by hypochromic effect could be noted up to 85 min
in the individual absorption spectra of MO, showing an initial increase
followed by the gradual decrease in peak intensities in both UV (i.e.,
λ = 275 and 317 nm) and visible (i.e., λ = 513 nm) regions
(Figure S11e–h). It was realized
that both azonium and ammonium tautomers of zwitterionic MO formed
weak aggregates at the relatively higher concentrations, showing little
tendency to be absorbed by the relatively negligible number of −COO– in PANIPN21 (Scheme S1e–h).

Interestingly, the combined absorption spectra of the 1:1
binary
mixture of MO–SF envisaged a gradual hypochromic effect at
513 nm, whereas the initial hyperchromic shift of the peaks was noted
at 275 and 248 nm. Similar effects were observed with greater extent
of overall adsorption by the increase in the [SF]/[MO] ratio up to
1:2. In this regard, the peak at 250 nm should only be attributed
to SF, whereas the other two peaks at 513 and 275 nm were characteristics
of both MO and SF. The prevalence of two types of benzene rings was
responsible for the appearance of two peaks at 248 and 275 nm in the
UV–vis spectrum of SF. In comparison to that of MO, the relative
lowering of SF onto the adsorbent was understood from the initial
time-dependent hyperchromic effect at 248 nm. Because the λmax values of MO and SF were almost similar at acidic pHi, the hypochromic effect at 513 nm could be resulted by the
combined adsorption of MO and SF. Thus, the attainment of poor adsorbing
tendency of SF was realized by the preferential attachment of resonance
hybrids of the azonium tautomer rather than those of the ammonium
tautomer of MO to produce a time-dependent hypochromic effect at 513
nm. As compared to that of SF, better adsorbing behavior of MO in
PANIPN21 was also realized from enhanced adsorption abilities by the
increasing proportion of MO in MO–SF. Furthermore, the overall
adsorption behavior of PANIPN21 became worse when SF became the major
component in the mixture, reaffirming better adsorbing tendency of
MO than that of SF onto PANIPN21. Thus, unlike the case for PANIPN41,
SF cations at acidic pHi were not readily adsorbed by PANIPN21,
owing to lesser availability of −COO– and
−COOH and the enhanced cationic character of PANIPN21 because
of a greater number of protonated secondary amides of NIPAm moieties.

3.12 Recyclability of PANIPNs
The cost-effectiveness
of PANIPN superadsorbents was assessed via desorption of the SF- and
M(II/III)-loaded PANIPNs at pHi = 2 and in 0.01 N solution
of NaCl, respectively, and repetitive adsorption of SF and M(II/III)
at the pHi = 9 and 7, respectively. Five consecutive adsorption–desorption
cycles were carried out separately by taking 30 ppm solutions at pHi 9 and 7 for SF and M(II/III), respectively, using the regenerated
PANIPNs (Figure 6).
However, complete desorption beyond 90% was obtained in all of the
cases.

Figure 6 Recyclability of PANIPNs for SF, Hg(II), Cd(II), and Cr(III).

3.13 Comparison
of the Results
Several
micro-/nanomaterial-based adsorbents, homo-/co-/terpolymers, and IPN
hydrogels have been applied for the adsorptive exclusion of Hg(II),
Cd(II), Cr(III), and SF of varying initial concentrations (1–1000
ppm), temperatures (283–333 K), and pHis (Table S9). From Table S9, it could be observed that the ACs of PANIPNs were either closer
to or much better than the already reported results within the definite
working range.

4 Conclusions
The
unorthodox in situ inclusion of acrylamido derivatives can
also be attempted for the synthesis of terpolymer/IPN hydrogels without
ex situ addition of third monomer. Hydrogels possessing various extents
of N-/O-donor ligands have demonstrated relative variation of physicochemical
properties and ACs for SF, Cd(II), Hg(II), and Cr(III). Indeed, the
chemical structure of PANIPNs, grafting of PN, physicochemical changes,
and possible modes of attachment between PANIPNs and dye/M(II/III)
have rationally been understood by performing systematic characterization
of both unadsorbed and adsorbed hydrogels using spectroscopic, thermal,
diffractometric, and microscopic methods. The structure–property
relationships of PANIPNs of varying comonomers have also been realized
by the measurements of % GC, % −COOH, pHPZC, LCST,
and network parameters, such as ρc and Mc, of IPNSs. Indeed, NMR and FTIR studies have indicated
the prevalence of strong physicochemical interactions between terpolymer
and grafted polysaccharide chains of PN, also harmonized from the
appearance of phaseless morphology in the SEM photomicrographs. Moreover,
the increasing trend of LCST from terpolymer to PANIPN has envisaged
the relative increase in hydrophilicity of PANIPN by grafted PN within
the hydrogel network. Furthermore, the formation of stronger Hg–N
covalent bonds by the preferential adsorption of Hg(II) has been established
by FTIR and XPS analyses, whereas variegated coordinative and ionic
interactions for Cd(II) and Cr(III) have been inferred via analyses
of high-resolution XPS spectra of all M(II/III)-PANIPN21. In this
context, relatively stronger affinity and thus greater relative population
of Hg–N bonds for PANIPN21 as compared to that for PANIPN41
have reflected the enhanced thermal stability of Hg(II)-PANIPN21 compared
to that of Hg(II)-PANIPN41, supported by the appearance of higher
AC, faster rate of adsorption, and higher −ΔG0 of PANIPN21 as compared to those of PANIPN41. In the
synergistic removal of structurally dissimilar dyes, removal efficiencies
have been found to depend strongly on the variation of concentration,
time, dilution effect, and monomer–dimer/tautomeric equilibrium,
comprehended through an extensive UV–vis analyses. This tailor-made
hydrogel of excellent physicochemical properties can also be attempted
for targeted drug delivery, tissue engineering, self-healing materials,
membrane-based applications, and sensors. The present systematic design
of PANIPNs exhibiting excellent recyclability, performance
characteristics toward kinetically fast and feasible chemisorption
of dye/M(II/III), very high adsorption efficiency (Table S9), and cost effectivity can be employed for developing
a cost-effective/ecofriendly waste management system.
