Silicone-containing
biobased hyperbranched polyurethane thermoplastic
elastomers at different compositions were reported for the first time.
The structures of the polymers were evaluated from Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy, NMR, X-ray diffraction, and energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy analyses. The synthesized elastomers possess high
molecular weight (1.11–1.38 × 105 g·mol–1) and low glass transition temperature (from −40.0
to −27.3 °C). These polymers exhibited multistimuli responsive
excellent repeatable intrinsic self-healing (100% efficiency), shape
recovery (100%), and efficient self-cleaning (contact angle 102°–107°)
abilities along with exceptional elongation at break (2834–3145%),
high toughness (123.3–167.8 MJ·m–3),
good impact resistance (18.3–20.3 kJ·m–1), and adequate tensile strength (5.9–6.9 MPa). Furthermore,
high thermal stability (253–263 °C) as well as excellent
UV and chemical resistance was also found for the polymers. Most interestingly,
controlled bacterial biodegradation under exposure of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacterial strains demonstrated
them as sustainable materials. Therefore, such biobased novel thermoplastic
polyurethane elastomers with self-healing, self-cleaning, and shape
memory effects possess great potential for their advanced multifaceted
applications.

Introduction
Smart high-performing
polymeric materials with shape memory, self-healing,
and self-cleaning effects have attracted researchers because of their
widespread applications including coating, packaging, biomedical,
automobile, aerospace, printing and so forth. Shape memory polymers
(SMP) are considered as stimuli-responsive smart polymers which can
recover their primary shape from a temporary deformed shape as required.1,2 In general, such smart polymer contains some flexible soft segment
and rigid hard segment in an appropriate composition. Again, designing
of self-healing polymers (SHP) maintained a great interest among researchers
as such polymers healed themselves upon damage.3 On the other hand, the self-cleaning polymers retain their
surfaces free from accumulation of contaminants.4 Literature advocates a few polymeric materials which can
exhibit the abovementioned smart properties. Sottos et al. synthesized
poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) based self-healing elastomer by incorporating
resinous microencapsule with cross-linker in the matrix.5 However, such elastomers can heal only one time
at a particular zone because of the exhaustion of the healing agent
from the incorporated microcapsules. To overcome this limitation,
designing of intrinsic SHP has been attempted by various approaches
such as molecular diffusion, reversible breaking, and reforming of
dynamic covalent or noncovalent bonds induced by heat energy, incorporation
of nano materials, and so forth.6,7 Zhao et al. synthesized
poly(siloxane-urethane)-based self-healing elastomer with shape memory
attributes but the time and temperature required for the healing were
too high.2 Urban and Ghosh reported an
oxetane-substituted chitosan-containing self-healing polyurethane
(PU) network, although the synthetic procedure is critical.8 Furthermore, over the last few decades, self-healing
has become much more attractive to the researchers because of amalgamation
of supramolecular chemistry in the healing process. For example, Roy
et al. used a dynamic self-healing approach through multihydrogen
bonding.9 Several reports have also been
found where healing was achieved through the metal–ligand interactions.10,11 However, the abovementioned polymeric material showed low mechanical
property. Thus, all of the polymers reported above have some demerits
and hence urge upon new development.

Again, a superhydrophobic
or photocatalytic surface can provide
self-cleaning ability to the polymeric materials.12 However, water-repellent capacity of the artificial superhydrophobic
surface gradually decreases with the accumulation of contaminants
and the natural weathering process, though it is not observed in such
naturally occurring surfaces including lotus leaves because they can
easily reform or regenerate the same.13 On the other hand, degradation of contaminants by the photocatalytic
effect requires an external photoresponsive material. Furthermore,
the approach may also degrade the parent polymer. Therefore, a hydrophobic
surface with high weathering resistance nature may be the right choice
to achieve self-cleaning property. In this milieu, Ramakrishna et
al. synthesized PU-containing octadecyl chain-grafted silica nanoparticles
by employing silanol–isocyanate reaction, which exhibited self-healing
ability along with self-cleaning property.14 Bayer et al. synthesized a superhydrophobic PU by incorporation
of nanoclay.15 Thus, the design of a polymer
with all these smart behaviors is highly challenging, if no external
agent is used. Molecular engineering with the right composition of
the appropriate components of an elastomeric PU may be an apt choice,
in this context. This is due to the inherent advantages of PUs among
other polymers.1 These include easy production
with tunable properties, inherent structural inhomogeneity within
the chain, and wide range of applications.

Furthermore, renewable
resource-based elastomeric PU can offer
desired biodegradability along with sustainability. In addition, incorporation
of branching in the structure of such PU not only improves its processing
characteristics, but it may also lead to some unique and useful properties.
Thus, studies on biobased hyperbranched PU thermoplastic elastomers
with the smart behaviors mentioned above will be very interesting
and may lead to different advanced applications. The authors, therefore,
attempted to achieve combined smart attributes such as shape memory,
self-cleaning, and self-healing in the reported biobased hyperbranched
PU thermoplastic elastomer. The mechanical, thermal, UV-resistant,
and biodegradability properties of the elastomers were also evaluated.
The authors also tried to establish the structure–property
relationship of such an elastomer.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
and Characterization of PUs
Hyperbranched
silicone-containing PU 1 (HSPU1) was synthesized by a one-pot prepolymerization
technique, as shown in Scheme 1. In the first step, to synthesize an isocyanate-terminated
prepolymer, an excess amount of aromatic isocyanate, 2,4/2,6-toluene
diisocyanate (TDI) (B2), was reacted with poly(ε-caprolactone)diol
(PCL) (A2), PDMS (A2′), and a biobased macroglycol, dimer
acid-glycerol-modified polyol (DAGP) (A2A2′). DAGP was used as the
branch generating unit. In the second step, the chain extension was
completed by reacting this prepolymer with monoglyceride (MG) of sunflower
oil (A2″) and aliphatic isocyanate and isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) (B2′). The overall
NCO/OH ratio was maintained as unity, as given in Table 1. IPDI contains primary and
secondary isocyanate groups which help to continue the reaction in
a step by step manner according to their reactivities.16 The good quality PU without any gel product
was obtained through this approach by controlling the reaction temperature,
rate of addition of the reactants, reaction time, and speed of agitation.
Further, to achieve the optimum performance, the amount of hard and
soft segments was kept around 35.3–38.5% and 61.4–64.6%,
respectively, as found in most of the earlier reported similar segmented
PUs.1,17 The presently synthesized PUs may be biodegradable,
as they contain easily hydrolysable ester and urethane linkages in
the structure as well as can be used as an alternative to petroleum-based
PUs, as they contain 19.7–22.8% biobased components.

Chemical Structure
Analysis
The Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectra of synthesized HSPUs along with linear silicone-containing
PU (LSPU) are displayed in Figure 1. The absence of the band at about 2270 cm–1 supports the absence of the free isocyanate group in the chains
of PUs.18,19 Thus, the reaction may be completed. Further,
the presence of the band at around 3436 cm–1 is
attributed to the stretching frequency of the N–H bond. A shoulder
band at 1742 cm–1 is assigned to the carbonyl stretching
frequency of the ester (O–C=O) linkage, and a band at
1638 cm–1 is assigned to the carbonyl stretching
frequency of the amide (−NH–C=O) linkage. Again,
the band at 1020 cm–1 represents the O–C=O
stretching frequency. The information given above supports the presence
of the urethane linkage −NH–(C=O)–O–
in the structure of synthesized PUs. On the other hand, the absorption
bands at 2925 and 2852 cm–1 represent the sp3-hybridized C–H bond of asymmetric and symmetric stretching
frequencies. Again, the band at 1267 cm–1 corresponds
to the bending vibration frequency of the −CH3 moiety
of PDMS. The absorption bands at 1100 and 1020 cm–1 are assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration
frequencies of the Si–O–Si bond, while the band at 794–800
cm–1 is accredited to the Si–C stretching
and–CH3 rocking.18

profiles of PUs.

The energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopic analyses confirmed the
presence of C, O, and Si elements in the structure of HSPU3 (Figure 1b) with weight and
atomic percentages of 59.09, 34.56, and 6.34 and 67.34, 29.57, and
3.09, respectively.

Furthermore, the structure of HSPU1 was
supported by the NMR spectral
study. In the 1H NMR spectrum (Figure 2a), the peaks at 0.85 (a), 0.90 (b), 0.95
(c), and 2.56 (d) ppm correspond to terminal methyl protons of PDMS,
MG, and DAGP and IPDI and TDI moieties. The peaks at 1.23–1.35
(e) ppm represented the methylene protons of PDMS, DAGP, PCL, and
MG. Again, the peaks that appeared at 2.32 (i) and 1.58 (f) ppm are
due to methylene protons (α and β) of PCL and DAGP, with
respect to the ester group. The peaks at 2.05 (g), 2.16 (h), and 2.77
(j) ppm are attributed to the protons adjacent to the double bond
of the DAGP moiety, whereas the protons attached to α carbon
of the double bond and methylene protons between the double bond of
MG. The peaks at 3.65 (k), 4.17 (m), and 4.03 (l) ppm are due to the
protons of IPDI, adjacent to the amide bond and α and β
carbons to oxygen of the ester linkage. Methylene protons of the glycerol
moiety were observed at 4.65 (n) and 4.89 (o) ppm. Aromatic protons
of TDI and aliphatic protons of the double bond, associated with MG
and DAGP, appear at 7.0–7.5 (q) and 5.34 (p) ppm. The −NH
protons of urethane bonds of IPDI and TDI are assigned at 8.75–8.87
(r) and 9.51 ppm (s). In the 13C NMR spectrum (Figure 2b), peaks for methyl
carbon of PDMS, MG, DAGP, and TDI moieties appeared at 14.41 (a) and
17.83 (b) ppm. The peaks that appeared at 22.51 (c), 28.3 (d), and
33.76 (e) ppm are due to three different methyl carbons of IPDI. The
peaks found in the region 24.60 (f), 25.41 (g) 27.23 (h), 29.26 (i),
and 31.56 (j) ppm correspond to methylene carbons of DAGP, PDMS, MG,
PCL, the methylene carbon between two double bonds, methylene carbon
α to the double bond and the ester group. The peaks at 63.98
(k) and 68.74 (l) ppm are associated with the methylene carbons of
the glycerol moiety. The peaks for the double-bonded and aromatic
carbons appeared in between the region 128.56–130.13 (m) and
136.1–137.9 (n) ppm. The peaks found at 154.02–155.48
(o) and 171.4–175.3 (p) ppm are attributed to the urethane
carbon and ester carbon, respectively. The peaks at 63.44 (D1), 63.17 (D2), 64.46 (L1), and 66 (T1) ppm were observed in the 13CNMR spectrum of HSPU1 representing
the carbon atoms of tetra-, tri-, di-, and monosubstituted DAGP moiety.19,20 The DB of HSPU1 was found to be 0.78, as determined by using the
integration of the corresponding peaks for D1, D2, L1, and T1. 1

of HSPU1.

Physical Structure
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
of HSPUs along with LSPU are shown in Figure 1c. The degree of crystallinity in all PUs
varies from 17.4 to 22.4% because of different wt % PCL and PDMS content.
However, the crystalline nature of PUs remains almost the same. The
XRD study revealed an amorphous halo at 12.2° because of the
PDMS moiety, while two peaks at 21.2° (calculated d spacing of 4.18 Å) and 23.5° (calculated d spacing of 3.78 Å) correspond to the (110) and (200) planes
of the orthorhombic lattice structure of the crystalline PCL moiety.21 The intensity of the peaks decreases with the
increase in the amount of PDMS. Thus, the peak in HSPU1 showed higher
intensity compared to the others. HSPU3 has the maximum amount of
PDMS, and thus, it has the least intensity. The peak intensities of
HSPU2 and LSPU were almost similar because of the similar amount of
PCL content.

Physical Properties
The measured
physical properties
of PUs are tabulated in Table 2. One the most important physical characteristics is solubility.
HSPUs were found to be soluble in polar aprotic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran,
dimethylacetamide, dimethylformamide, and dimethyl sulfoxide and halogenated
solvents such as chloroform, dichloromethane, and so forth. The solubility
was also observed in acetone, though PUs were insoluble in hexane,
ethanol, and so forth. This good solubility is accredited to the hyperbranched
structure of HSPUs and the presence of polar hydroxyl, ester, and
urethane groups along with the nonpolar long flexible hydrocarbon
moiety in them. The specific gravity (1.58–1.83) and solution
viscosity values of HSPUs were also found to be increased with the
increase in the content of PDMS. However, the solution viscosity of
PUs was found to be slightly low, compared to their molecular weight.
Compared to LSPU, HSPUs possess lower solution viscosity which is
because of unique structural geometry HSPUs. The average molecular
weight was found to be in the order of 105, which seems
to be very high (Table 2). The molecular weight was found to follow a decrease in the trend
with the increase of PDMS content. Furthermore, the low polydispersity
index (PDI) of HSPUs (1.41–1.62) showed a well-defined property.22

The morphology of the synthesized
PUs was highly affected by the
structure, chemical compositions, processing condition, viscosity,
miscibility, and crystallinity of the components.23 Optical images of the synthesized PUs were taken, and these
images were further processed with the help of ImageJ software to
display the difference in the morphology among the PUs. From the surface
3D plot images, it is clearly evident that roughness of the PUs increases
from HSPU1 to HSPU3. This is might be due to the incompatibility between
crystalline PCL and amorphous PDMS moiety in the molecular level,
resulting in the spherulitic pattern, as shown in Figure S2.21 The intensity of the
spherulitic pattern increases with the increase of the amount of PDMS.
Thus, HSPU3 exhibited the roughest architecture among HSPU2, HSPU1,
and LSPU.

Mechanical Properties
Mechanical properties (displayed
in Table 2) of the
PU strips were strongly influenced by the molecular weight of PUs
and their soft segment, hard to soft segment ratio, crystallinity,
physical cross-linking, chain entanglement, orientation of segments,
hydrogen bonding, and so forth. From the stress–strain curves
(Figure 1d), it is
evident that all PUs showed outstanding elongation at break as well
as good tensile strength. The elastomeric behavior of PUs is due to
the high molecular weight of the polymer and low glass transition
temperature (as discussed later). Exceptionally high elongation at
break (flexibility) of the synthesized PUs is attributed to the high
molar mass (105 order), long flexible hydrocarbon chains
of MG and DAGP in the structure of the polymer along with the presence
of primary and secondary interactions. In addition, high flexibility
of the Si–O–Si bond (bond angle of the Si–O–Si
bond varies from 140° to 160°) in the structure of the PDMS
moiety also supports high elongation of molecular chains under the
direction of applied force.24 Further,
these elongation at break values of HSPUs were found to be much higher
than the other reported PUs.25,26 The presence of aromatic
and aliphatic diisocyanates (TDI and IPDI) with a chain extender (MG)
as the hard segment, crystallinity, large amount of secondary interactions,
and higher H-bonding in hard segments (compared to the soft segments)
provide rigidity of the synthesized PUs. The strength of HSPUs decreases
with the increase of the flexible PDMS content. The combination of
exceptionally high elongation and good tensile strength makes the
synthesized PUs mechanically tough. The toughness of PU strips was
calculated from the area under the stress–strain curve. HSPUs
showed comparatively better mechanical property than its linear analogue,
LSPU, because of the hyperbranched architecture and the presence of
large numbers of secondary interactions. The impact resistance values
of HSPUs and LSPUs were also found to be high (greater than the maximum
limit of the used instrument), which may be because of high flexibility
and strength of the former. As the maximum height of the instrument
is 1 m and the energy per unit thickness corresponding to the maximum
height until which the film is not damaged was taken as the impact
resistance, the energy value also depends on the thickness of the
sample. Thus, even though the falling height was the same for each
reported value, the exact value of corresponding energy may vary because
of the difference in thickness of the films. Similarly, scratch hardness
of both HSPUs also decreases with the increase of the soft segment
content. Overall, the mechanical properties of the synthesized PUs
were found to be significantly higher than the reported biobased PUs.2

Thermal Properties
Generally, thermal
stability of
PUs depends on several factors such as chemical structure, composition,
urethane linkages, molecular weight, degree of virtual cross-linking
points, and intra-/intermolecular forces. Three-step degradation patterns
were observed from the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) thermograms
as well as their corresponding derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) curves
(Figure 3a,b) of the
synthesized PUs.27,28 The onset degradation temperature
(TON) ranging from 253 to 263 °C
is due to the presence of thermolabile moieties such as the terminal
methyl group of TDI and long aliphatic chains of MG and DAGP. The
onset degradation temperature (Table 3) increased with the increase of PDMS content from
HSPU1 to HSPU3. Again, because of the absence of DAGP, the first degradation
peak was not prominently visualized in the DTG thermogram of LSPU.
However, the second step of thermal degradation of PUs is because
of the degradation of urethane, ester, and cycloaliphatic moieties
of the chains. The rate of degradation (TMAX) was found to be the height in the temperature range of 414–417
°C which corresponds to the degradation of thermostable moieties,
that is, the aromatic unit of TDI. On the other hand, end set degradation
(TEND) corresponds to the degradation
of most thermostable moieties such as the Si–O–Si bond
of PDMS. From the DTG curves of the synthesized PUs, it is found that
with the decrease in the amount of the biobased content from HSPU1
to HSPU3, the degradation temperature also increases. Furthermore,
no significant difference in TON, TMAX, and TEND set
temperature between HSPUs and LSPU was observed. High molecular weight
of the LSPU may be the reason for it.

Again,
from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves, as
displayed in Figure 3c, and the tabulated values (Table 3), glass transition temperature (Tg) and melting temperature (Tm) of the soft segment were estimated for the PUs. Several factors
affect the Tg value, which include molecular
mass of the soft and hard segments, chemical structure, cross-linking,
crystallization, and the presence of other components. The Tg value of the synthesized HSPUs decreases with
the increase of flexible PDMS content as well as the decrease of crystallinity
(Table 3). On the contrary,
LSPU exhibited the highest Tg value because
of the highest crystallinity. The Tm value
of the soft segment of PUs varies in the range of 1–2.1 °C.
However, all these values are much lower than other PCL-based PUs
with similar components reported earlier, which may be because of
the plasticization effect of PDMS and MG moieties.17,21 This marginal variation of results is the reflection of the similar
crystalline nature of the soft segments.

Self-Healing Property
The fractured surfaces’
optical images, tensile strength of healed PU strips (up to third
cycle), and healing efficiency (Figure 4a–c) clearly describe the effective self-healing
of the PU films. The images of PUs films, before and after healing,
support the self-healing behaviors of the synthesized polymers. PUs
are segmented polymers with thermodynamically incompatible hard and
soft segments. It is well known that the chain mobility of PU enhances
at elevated temperature, and hence, interfacial diffusion results
in quick healing (Table 3) of the fractured surface.29 A further
DSC study indicated the low Tg and Tm values for the soft segment of the synthesized
PUs exhibited (Table 3). Again, lower the Tg, faster is the
rate of healing. The rate of healing is also related with the shape
memory effect. The combination of these two effects is controlling
the self-healing rate.6 Thus, upon exposure
of stimuli such as a microwave (450 W) and sunlight, the surface polar
groups absorbed the required energy and started to oscillate their
dipoles which subsequently enhanced the temperature of the exposed
surface greater than the Tg and Tm of the soft segments. Hence, a rapid Brownian
motion occurred in the soft segment that led to rearrangement of molecular
chains in soft segments to repair the crack surface. From the self-healing
study, it was observed that with the decrease in the amount of PCL
from HSPU1 to HSPU3, the time requirement for the healing process
increases. Thus, crystallinity plays an important role in the healing
process. HSPU1 contains the highest amount of PCL and hence favors
the fastest healing compared to others. Because of very similar extent
of crystalline of HSPU2 and LSPU, time required for healing is almost
same. All the PU films were effectively healed within 58–70
s under a microwave (450 W) and 8–10 min under direct sunlight.
Most significantly, this self-healing is accomplished through diffusion
and rearrangement processes of the soft segment of PUs and hence the
healing process can be repeated number of time. In fact, the tensile
strength of PUs remains almost same even after second cycle as shown
in Figure 4b. Thus,
the studied PUs showed very fast and efficient self-healing ability
with 100% retention in mechanical property which is much better than
other reported self-healing polymers.2,25

Shape-Memory Study
The shape fixity (%), shape recovery
(%), and time required for the shape recovery process of the synthesized
PUs are given in Table 3. The shape memory behaviors of the synthesized PUs upon MW irradiation
are shown in Figure 5. Shape memory behavior depends on several factors such as the amount
of hard to soft segment ratio, structure of components used as the
hard segment (IPDI, TDI, and MG), molecular weight of the soft segment,
molecular weight of PU, and so forth.26 When the PU strips were heated above their melting temperature of
the soft segments, Brownian motion occurred among the molecular chains.
Thus, they can be easily deformed by applying an external force. Rapid
freezing of the stretched PU strips below the melting temperature
at −(15 ± 5) °C restricted the chain mobility of
the polymer as well as decreased the entropy of the system. Thus,
upon removal of the external force, the molecular chains were unable
to gain required energy to reverse back the deformation, and at the
same time, covalent cross-linking in the hard segment and the rigid
crystalline segment prevented the sliding of the polymer domains.
Because of the same reason, shape fixity decreases with the decrease
of the crystalline nature from HSPU1 to HSPU3. LSPU and HSPU1 displayed
almost a similar type of crystallinity, thus resulting in better fixity
compared to HSPU2 and HSPU3. Upon reheating the PU strips above their
melting temperature, chain mobility increases, resulting in the increase
in the entropy of the system which helps to regain its original stable
coiled architecture. The increase speed of shape recovery (57–41
s) under the exposure of MW from LSPU3 to HSPU1 is due to the increase
of elastic strain energy. Again, this elastic strain energy increases
with the increase of urethane linkages, physical cross-linking, and
molecular weight of such PUs.30

behaviors of PUs under microwave (450 W).

Surface Hydrophobicity Study
The hydrophobic nature
of the PU surface depends upon both the surface chemical composition
(intrinsic hydrophobicity) and the surface geometrical microstructures
(roughness).12,13 The structure of the synthesized
PU contains nonpolar moieties such as long aliphatic hydrocarbon chains
of MG and DAGP and aromatic and aliphatic parts of diisocyanates which
provided the intrinsic hydrophobic character in the structure. In
addition to the above, the nonpolar nature and low surface energy
of PDMS also significantly contribute in enhancing such hydrophobicity
as reflected in the digital images of water droplets of PU surfaces
(Figure 6a). Furthermore,
the amorphous PDMS moiety is not compatible with the crystalline PCL
moiety of the PU structure.21 This incompatibility
created microroughness (Figure 6b) on the surface of PU films. The combination of these two
effects provides a hydrophobic surface. The contact angle increases
with the increase of the PDMS content as well as increase in incompatibility
from HSPU1 to HSPU3, as given in Table 3. Most interestingly, the difference between the advancing
angle and the receding angle, that is, the angle of hysteresis, is
an important factor for rolling the water droplets on the surface
of PUs. The lower the value of angle of hysteresis, the higher is
the hydrophobicity and better is the self-cleaning effect. Furthermore,
both in acidic and alkaline pH, the results of the contact angle were
almost the same, indicating their applicability under all atmospheric
conditions.

before and after UV aging, (d) growth curve of P. aeruginosa on PUs, and (e,f) biodegraded surface of HSPU3 and LSPU.

UV-Aging Study
Synthesized PUs displayed
excellent
UV resistance as supported by retention of the mechanical properties
after UV aging (Table 3). UV-aged PU strips showed slight reduction in flexibility as measured
by elongation at break (Figure 6c), although the tensile strength value remains almost constant.
Basically, during UV aging both chain scission and cross-linking took
place.29 These two contradictory effects
on mechanical strength cancel each other, so the resulting strength
remains almost the same, while the reduction of flexibility upon UV
exposure may be due to additional cross-linking as well as chain scission
from oxidation reaction. Even though the exact mechanism of the photolytic
degradation of PU is not known but literature advocated photo-oxidation
of −CH2 groups result slightly yellowish coloration
of the PU strips.31,32 The better UV resistance of HSPUs
than LSPUs is due to the hyperbranched structure with confined geometry
of the former. However, as the amount of UV-active components in all
HSPUs is the same, the effect was not significantly different.

Conclusions
From this study, it can be concluded that the silicone-containing
high-molecular weight thermoplastic PU elastomer with hyperbranched
architecture was successfully synthesized by the conventional prepolymerization
technique for the first time. Instrumental analyses, especially NMR
spectral studies, help to understand the structure of the synthesized
PU elastomer. The structural architecture and appropriate composition
of the right components of PU can lead to exceptional flexibility,
high toughness, high thermal, UV, and chemical resistance, as well
as special attributes such as excellent intrinsic repeatable multistimuli-responsive
self-healing, shape memory, and self-cleaning ability. Additionally,
biodegradability of the synthesized renewable resource-based PUs might
solve genuine problems of land and water pollution and solid waste
management issues. Thus, the studied biodegradable smart PU can hold
significant promise as a sustainable material for its potential applications.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Bis(hydroxyalkyl)-PDMS (Mn ≈ 5600 g·mol–1, Sigma-Aldrich,
Japan), dimer acid (DA, Mn ≈ 570
g mol–1, Sigma-Aldrich, USA), glycerol (Merck, India),
PCL (Mn = 2000 g mol–1, Sigma-Aldrich, USA), sunflower oil (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), and 1,4-butanediol
(BD, Merck, India) were dried at elevated temperature under vacuum
for at least 12 h before use. IPDI (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), TDI (Merck,
Germany), oxalic acid (Rankem, India), potassium hydroxide (Rankem,
India), maleic anhydride (Merck-Schuchardt), butylamine (Sigma-Aldrich,
USA), bromophenol blue indicator pH 3.5–4.6 (Merck, India),
isopropyl alcohol (SRL, Mumbai, India), para-toluene
sulfonic acid (p-TSA SRL, Mumbai, India), hydrochloric
acid (36%) (Rankem, India), CaO (Merck, India), and toluene (Merck,
India) were used as received from the supplier. N,N-Dimethyl acetamide (Merck, India) was used after
drying overnight using calcium oxide, followed by distillation under
reduced pressure. Xylene (Merck, India) was used only after normal
distillation.

Preparation of DAGP
DAGP was prepared
by esterification
reaction of 3 mol of DA with 6 mol of glycerol in the presence of p-TSA (0.5 wt % of DA) at 160 °C for 2 h, as reported
earlier.17

Preparation of MG
MG of sunflower oil was prepared
by the standard glycerolysis process, where two equivalents of glycerol
react with one equivalent of sunflower oil in the presence of CaO
(0.05 wt % of sunflower oil) at (220 ± 5) °C under N2 atmosphere.30

Synthesis of
HSPU
HSPU was synthesized by a two-step
prepolymerization technique using a three-neck round-bottom flask
equipped with a nitrogen gas inlet, a mechanical stirrer, a Teflon
septum, and a thermometer. PCL (2.1 mM, 4.2 g), PDMS (0.1 mM, 0.56
g), and DAGP (0.2 mM, 0.15 g) were placed in the reaction vessel with
1.5 mL xylene under constant stirring, and the solid content was maintained
at about 80 wt %. After dissolving PCL, TDI (3.2 mM, 0.557 g) was
added dropwise to the abovementioned reaction mixture by using a syringe
at room temperature under nitrogen atmosphere. Then, the reaction
mixture was heated at 85–90 °C for 4 h until the desired
viscosity was obtained which was considered as the prepolymer. After
cooling the reaction mixture, the calculated amount of MG (4.6 mM,
1.628 g) and IPDI (4 mM, 0.88912 g) was added with 8 mL of xylene
to maintain the solid content at 50 wt %. The temperature of the reaction
mixture was then increased step by step up to 110 °C. Under this
condition, the reaction was continued for 5 h until very high viscosity
was achieved without any gel formation. The absence of an isocyanate
band at 2270 cm–1 in the FT-IR spectrum and butyl
amine test supported the completion of the reaction. By following
the exact same procedure, other HSPUs were synthesized with the same
amount of the branching component but different amounts of PCL and
PDMS. The actual compositions of all HSPUs with their respective code
are given in Table 1. The linear silicone-containing PU (LSPU) with the same composition
was also prepared by replacing branch generating unit DAGP with an
equivalent amount of BD. A small part of the synthesized HSPU solution
was precipitated in water repeatedly for NMR analyses. The remaining
amount was cast on a glass plate (10 mm × 60 mm × 5.9 mm),
a galvanized tin sheet (150 mm × 50 mm × 0.61 mm), and kept
for 48 h in room temperature to remove the solvent, and then these
PU films were dried in a convection oven at 70 °C to remove the
remaining amount of the solvent along with any entrapped volatile
to obtain a film with thickness of 1–2 mm for other tests and
analyses.

Characterization
Structural Analysis
Structural characterization
of
the synthesized PUs was done with the help of different spectroscopic
and diffraction techniques such as FT-IR, NMR, and XRD, as reported
elsewhere, and a brief description is provided in the Supporting Information.17

Physical, mechanical, and thermal properties and self-healing
ability of the PUs were also evaluated, and details of the processes
are given in the Supporting Information.

Shape Memory Test
To evaluate the shape memory behavior
of the PU strips, the spiral bending test was performed. At first,
they were heated at 60 °C for 5 min and folded in the form of
the spiral shape. Immediately, the spiral-shaped samples were frozen
to release the stress in an ice bath for 10 min. For shape recovery
of the PU strips, they were projected under different stimuli such
as MW (at 450 W), heat (60 °C), and sunlight (35 ± 2) °C.
The same procedure was repeated up to 5 times, and the average result
was given for each compositions. The shape recovery and shape fixity
as two shape-memory parameters are calculated from the following equations 2   3  where θf represents the released
angle after cooling and θr represents the angle after
recovery.26 The values of θf and θr are calculated as displayed in Figure S1
of the Supporting Information.

Self-Cleaning
Test
The self-cleaning property of the
synthesized PU strips was investigated by visualizing the digital
photographs of acidic, basic, and neutral water droplets on the polymer
surface and measuring their advancing angle, receding angle, and the
angle of hysteresis by using ImageJ software.

and Chemical Resistance Test
The UV aging
test as reported earlier and the chemical resistance test as per ASTM
D 543-67 method are briefly discussed in the Supporting Information.

turbidity method
was used for the biodegradation study of the synthesized PUs, as reported
