Homodimerization and crossed-dimerization
reactions for ferulic
acid and related compounds in an acidic ethanol solution were investigated
via a formal [3 + 2] cycloaddition reaction. Arylindanes, as the major
products, were produced from some of the acids with hydroxy group
and/or methoxy groups at the para and meta positions of the phenyl
ring. The formation of arylindane required the following consecutive
reactions: (I) protonation of the first produced ester to afford to
a benzylic cation, (II) which reacts with another ester to afford
a new benzylic cation, and (III) followed by cyclization to produce
the dimer. It is suggested that the para-substituent promoted both
step I and step II and the meta-substituent accelerated step III.
To rationalize the selectivity of homodimerization, the stability
of the benzyl cations and the specific electron distribution on the
molecular surface of each ester is discussed based on the results
of the molecular orbital calculations.

Introduction
Interest
in the potential of the indane skeleton as a valuable
structure for pharmaceuticals has led to the stereoselective synthesis
of compounds comprising an indane ring and its investigation using
different types of reactions and starting materials.1−11 Various arylindanes have been found to be derived from propenylbenzene
through biosyntheses or organic syntheses. In particular, an asarone
dimer (Figure 1) found
in the essential oil of Acorus calamus was determined to be an insect growth regulator.12 Secaloside A (Figure 1), found in pollen extract, was responsible for antitumor
activity.13 Synthetic approaches to prepare
the arylindanes from benzyl alcohols and benzhydrols with styrene
derivatives have also been investigated under acidic conditions.11,14,15 In these reactions, although
the phenyl ring substituents were shown to significantly affect the
yield and diastereoselectivity, a convincing explanation has not been
provided as yet.

Figure 1 Typical example of the compounds containing arylindane
structure.

We have developed a mass production
method, starting from rice
bran,16 for ferulic acid 1a (Figure 2), which
is a propenylbenzene commonly found in cereals, grasses, vegetables,
and so on and has numerous biological activities for health.17 As the arylindane structure is a key compound
in the natural products such as secaloside A, the reaction conditions
to prepare the dimers were considered worth investigating. In general,
arylindane is known to have four diastereomeric racemates (α,
β, γ, and δ).18Figure 3 shows the predicted
homodimers obtained from 1a. The α form of 3a was obtained in acidic conditions; however, the details
of the reaction were not explored.19 The
reaction conditions used to prepare the dimer 3a from 1a were examined in detail, and the stereochemistries of the
dimers were determined.20 The structural
features of the dimers and the diastereoselective formation mechanisms
involved in forming the two types of racemic diastereomers (α
and γ, ca. 2:1) were characterized.20 Although this type of reaction is known to proceed as a formal [3
+ 2] cycloaddition reaction,14 it is suggested
that the methoxy and hydroxy groups attached to the phenyl ring play
an important role in the reactivity and stereoselectivity.

racemates of arylindane obtained from 1a.

In this study, the substituent effect on the [3
+ 2] cycloaddition
of ferulic acid and related compounds having hydroxy and methoxy groups
at the meta and the para positions of the phenyl ring was investigated.
The products yields depended on the phenyl ring substituents, and
the reactivity was discussed in terms of the effect of electron-donating
groups, the stability of benzylic cations, and the electrostatic potential
maps of the reaction intermediates.

Results and Discussion
The homodimerization reaction of the ferulic acid 1a has been previously examined in detail and the reaction conditions
were optimized as follows; 50–60 equiv EtOH, >10 equiv H2SO4, >0.5 h reaction time, and reflux temperature
(80 °C).20 This cyclization reaction
was confirmed to occur after ethyl ferulate was produced. The cyclization
reaction of ethyl ferulate as a starting material under similar acidic
ethanolic conditions gave corresponding indane in a little smaller
yield (28%). The feature of this reaction using ferulic acid is as
follows: (a) one-pot esterification of the ferulic acid followed by
dimerization of the formed ester to afford arylindane. (b) The higher
amount of sulfuric acid is required for predominant formation of arylindane.
Therefore, reactions of various cinnamic acids to evaluate the substituent
effects were conducted to obtain the corresponding arylindanes, and
the results are summarized in Table 1. In the reaction of 1a, 1b, 1c, and 1f, the arylindanes 3a, 3b, 3c, and 3f were produced
in 48, 52, 10, and 28% yields, respectively. Indane was not obtained
in the reaction of the other examined cinnamic acids. This dimerization
reaction of the formed esters is known to proceed by a formal [3 +
2] cycloaddition reaction comprising the following three steps, as
shown in Scheme 1:
(I) a proton reacts with the ester 2 to produce the benzylic
cation A+, (II) the cation A+ reacts with a double bond of another
ester to produce a dimeric cation B+, and (III) the intramolecular aromatic electrophilic substitution
reaction for the cyclization in the cation B+ occurs to produce arylindane 3. In a
previous report,20 we predicted that the
methoxy or hydroxy groups would play an important role in stabilizing
the intermediate with a stacking configuration through OH-π
or CH-π interaction. However, this prediction was not supported
by the results obtained in this report. For the formation of 3, cinnamic acid or its ester seems to need to bear two substituents,
such as a methoxy group or a hydroxy group at the para and meta positions.
According to the resonance structure, the methoxy or hydroxy group
at the para position of the phenyl ring increases the electronic density
of the double bond of the ester; hence, the reaction steps I and II
likely occur to yield the indane ring. It was assumed that the para-substituent
was needed to generate the benzylic cation. In fact, in the reaction
of 1d, 1g, and 1j without the
para-substituents, no dimer was produced, and the corresponding esters
were predominantly yielded. In the reaction of 1e and 1i, wherein the substituent existed only at the para position
of the phenyl ring, the corresponding indanes were not obtained, and
the dimers 6e(E), 6i(Z),
and 7i were obtained in small yields (Figure 4).

the reaction of 1e and 1i.

The substituents
at the meta position of the phenyl ring acted
as electron-donating groups. Thus, the electron density at the ortho
and para positions was enriched to accelerate the aromatic electrophilic
substitution reaction required for the cyclization reaction (step
III). However, the higher effect of the electron-donating group at
the meta position instead of the para position was considered to induce
the aromatic electrophilic substitution reaction between the benzylic
cation and the meta position of the phenyl ring of the ester. In fact,
in the reaction of 1c, 1f, and 1h, the dimers 4c (11%), 4f (3%), and 4h (14%) were produced, respectively. In the reaction of 1h, wherein three substituents existed, 3h was
not produced as compared with the reaction of 1b, but 4h was afforded in a 14% yield. The benzylic cation of 1h was expected to react predominantly with the activated
ortho position of the ester before the formation of the dimeric cation
by the attack to the double bond of the ester. Alternatively, in the
reaction of 1b, the indane 3b was obtained
in 52% yield, and the dimer 5b (cis/trans = 1:1) was also produced in 10% yield. It was assumed,
as mentioned above, that the hydroxy group at the para position of 1b activated the double bond of the ester and the ortho position
of the phenyl ring was activated by the methoxy groups at the meta
positions. As discussed above, para- and meta-substituents at the
phenyl ring of the acids played an important role in affecting the
electronic characteristics of the molecules and intermediates in steps
I–III. Thus, the formation of arylindane requires the three-step
reaction to occur in series.

Diastereomeric selectivities (α/γ)
in the reaction
of 1a, 1b, 1c, and 1f were around 2.3 and the indane α was predominantly produced.
The indane β was not isolated in any of the examined reactions,
and the indane 3f(δ) was isolated only in the reaction
of 1f in 1% yield. Figure 5 shows the partial 1H NMR spectra of 3f(α), 3f(γ), and 3f(δ). Although the spectral pattern was clearly different for each isomer,
the spectral features of these isomers were the doublet signals of
the Hc protons. The molecular structure of the indane 3c(α) and the dimer 5b (trans) were determined via X-ray diffraction (see Figure S75). Two enantiomers of 3c(α) were
packed into the crystal lattice (see Figure S76).

Figure 5 Partial 1H NMR spectra of 3f(α), 3f(γ), and 3f(δ).

The crossed dimerization between 1a and 1b was investigated to clarify the reactivities
of some cinnamic acids
(Scheme 2). Although
a complex mixture was obtained from the reaction, the products were
isolated using preparative high performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) as much as possible. As a result, the crossed dimers 8ab and 9ab were obtained in 16 and 17% yields,
respectively, and the homodimers 3a and 3b were produced in 28 and 31% yields, respectively (Table 2). This was explained by the
esters 2a and 2b having a similar reactivity.
Next, the two benzylic cations generated from each ester that reacted
with the reactive double bonds of both esters were cyclized at the
activated ortho position of the intermediates. This mechanism coincided
with the reactivity of the acids mentioned above. In the cross-dimerization
of 1a with 1d, the dimers 8ad and 9ad were not formed, and only 3a was
obtained. This showed that the crossed dimerization of 1a did not proceed with the other acids that did not form the corresponding
indane.

To investigate
the reactivity of the formed esters 2a–j, the energy difference (ΔE) between each
ester and the corresponding benzyl cation generated
by the acid was calculated, as shown in Table 3. In the case of the esters 2a, 2b, 2c, and 2f that produced
the corresponding indanes, the ΔE values were
relatively low (<−170 kJ/mol), suggesting that the benzylic
cations would be likely generated. However, the esters 2e, 2h and 2i, having low ΔE values, did not produce the corresponding indanes. For 2e and 2i, the benzylic cation might
have been produced, but the cyclization reaction was unfavorable due
to a lack of reactivity at the ortho position of the phenyl ring,
as mentioned above. In the case of 2h, 4h was produced instead of indane. The reactivity of the ortho position
of the phenyl ring of 2h was considered to be higher
than that of the double bond owing to two substituents at the meta
position, whereas the benzyl cation was also produced. To discuss
these results, the molecular electrostatic potential maps were calculated,
and the results for the esters 2a, 2b, and 2h are shown in Figure 6. The negative regions (in red) are located on the aromatic
ring, double bond, and oxygen atoms in each ester, whereas the positive
regions (in blue) are located on the methyl groups in the methoxy
groups of 2a and 2b. There was no positive
region on the methoxy groups in 2h. Therefore, for 2a and 2b, the benzyl cation might be favored
to attack the double bond due to electrostatic repulsion between the
positive charges located around the aromatic ring. Alternatively,
the benzyl cation of 2h might attack the aromatic ring
without repulsive interaction.

Conclusions
Homodimers with arylindane
skeletons were obtained from ferulic
acid 1a in an acidic ethanol solution via a formal [3
+ 2] cycloaddition reaction. Various cinnamic acids having hydroxy
and/or methoxy groups at various positions on the phenyl ring were
also investigated. This reaction arose from the protonation of the
first produced ester to afford a benzylic cation, which reacted with
another ester to afford a new benzylic cation, which then cyclized
to produce the homodimer. The reactivities of the intermediates, such
as the esters and cations, were interpreted by studying the effects
of the electron-donating groups, the energy difference between the
ester and the benzylic cation, and the molecular electrostatic potential
map. It was suggested that the para-substituent promoted the formation
of the benzylic cation and the coupling reaction between the cation
and the double bond of another ester, and that the meta-substituent
accelerated the cyclization process through electrophilic aromatic
substitution. The calculation of the stability of the benzyl cations
and the electrostatic potential map of the esters revealed that the
reactivity of the intermediates depended on the substituents of the
phenyl ring.

Experimental Section
All the solvents
and reagents were obtained commercially and used
without further purification. 1H NMR, 13C NMR,
and two-dimensional NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance-400
instrument using tetramethylsilane as the internal standard. The Fourier-transform
infrared spectra were recorded using a single reflection horizontal
attenuated total reflectance (ATR). High resolution mass spectrometry
HRMS (electrospray ionization time-of-flight, ESI-TOF) spectra were
measured in either negative or positive ionization mode, and the data
were reported in the form of m/z values. Preparative HPLC equipped with an octadecylsilyl column
(250 × 20 mm, 5 μm) using MeOH/H2O (60:40) as
the eluent was used to isolate the product mixtures. Melting points
were determined by using a differential scanning calorimeter, and
the peak top temperatures were reported. The isolated yields for the
esters were reported, and the yields of the dimers were estimated
from the 1H NMR spectra of the mixtures. The esters 2a–j were identified via 1H
and 13C NMR spectra (see the Supporting Information).

Homodimerization of 1a
To a solution of 1a (300 mg, 1.54 mmol) in ethanol (4.96
mL, 85 mmol), which
was cooled in an ice bath and kept under an Ar atmosphere, was added
sulfuric acid (1.65 mL, 31 mmol). The mixture was stirred for 1 h
at 80 °C, followed by the addition of ice-water to stop the reaction.
The products were extracted using dichloromethane, and the extract
was first washed with water, then water saturated with sodium bicarbonate,
and finally with water again. The organic portion was dried over MgSO4. After evaporating the solvent, the product was purified
through an SiO2 column (1:1 EtOAc/hexane as the eluent),
which afforded 51 mg of 2a (15%, isolated), the indane
mixture 3a(α) (34%), and 3a(γ) (14%). The isomers were isolated from the mixture using a preparative
HPLC for characterization.

Computational Methods
The energy
difference between each ester and the corresponding
benzyl cation as well as the molecular electrostatic potential map
for each ester was calculated as follows. Conformational searches
were performed with SPARTAN 16 using an MMFF force field. The obtained
stable conformers were optimized using density functional theory calculations
at the ωB97XD/6-31+G(d) level using SPARTAN 16. The partial
charges and molecular surfaces for each ester were calculated using
SPARTAN 16 with the same function of structural optimization, as described
above.
