Hydrophobic foam was prepared by immersing nickel foam
in a dispersion
of octyl group-grafted graphene oxide (GO) and used to clean up oil–water
mixtures. Octyl graphene oxide (C8-GO) was synthesized
using GO and triethoxyoctylsilane by a solvothermal method. The resulting
coverage of the foam was characterized, and the surface morphology
of the foam was also investigated. The static water contact angle
(SWCA) was measured to evaluate the change in wettability of the developed
foam. The pristine smooth microstructure of the nickel foam became
rough after being covered with the C8-GO nanosheets. The
SWCA of C8-GO nickel foam (C8-GO NF) surface
was approximately 147°. The C8-GO NF can float on
the surface of the water in contrast to the easy-sinking unmodified
foam, demonstrating good hydrophobicity. Furthermore, the C8-GO NF showed outstanding performance in organic compound adsorption
and excellent efficiency in oil–water separation. The reusability
and durability of the obtained foam are evaluated to highlight its
usability in more complicated scenarios. The use of C8-GO
NF was proved to be a promising strategy for oil–water separation
under harsh circumstance.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The leakage of oil in
water, especially in public waters, has had
many negative effects on the economy and public health. These public
hazards can lead to health risks to citizen’s lives. More seriously,
some organic compounds are hard to decompose and cause long-term harm
to humans.1 The highly efficient removal
of oil in water is needed for more advanced disposal quality and lower
cost. To date, there are several ways to prevent oil/organic leakage
from spreading over a wide range, such as biodegradation,2 chemical dispersants,3 mechanical collection,4 and in situ burning.5 Nevertheless, these methods have the drawbacks
of separation inefficiency, a long time requirement, and a high cost
of operation. Moreover, secondary pollution is difficult to address
in these processes.6 Thus, oil–water
separation using sorbents is the most effective method for removing
oils or organic solvents due to its recyclability and environmentally
friendly properties. Various hydrophobic absorbents have been prepared
for oil remediation, such as amine-modified clays,7 synthetic polymers,8 functionalized
fly ash,9 and corn straw.10 However, these materials are limited for heavy oil separation
because an oil barrier is formed on the material surface and prevents
water permeation.11 Thus, an ideal absorbent
material is urgently required. Porous materials are attractive for
their facile preparation processes, large surface area, excellent
stability, and good recyclability.

Foam can be used as a potential
material for oil–water separation.
Polymeric foams are widely used in the fields of oil spill cleanups.
Hou et al. prepared the open-cell foam using polypropylene with a
water contact angle of 151.5° and demonstrated an adsorption
capacity of 48.9 g g–1 for carbon tetrachloride.12 Zhang et al. used polypropylene by the melt
extrusion and leaching method to prepare the open-cell polymeric foam.
However, the open-cell structures have the disadvantage of lower mechanical
properties.13 Metal foam, a type of porous
material, is flexible and has high malleability and mechanical strength.
Metal foam is a potential substrate for oil–water separation
after the coating or bonding of hydrophobic groups. Li et al. prepared
CuO-coated foam with superhydrophobic properties by a solution-immersion
process for heavy oil separation.11 Zhu’s
group synthesized several hydrophobic copper foams by the in situ
growth of Cu(OH)2 or ZnO nanomaterials on the skeleton.15 Nickel foam (NF) has a cellular structure consisting
of solid metal and interconnected pores comprising a large portion
of its volume. Various hydrophobic nickel foams have been fabricated
and used to treat and clean oil and organic contaminants from water.
To obtain the selectivity without sacrificing the huge surface area,
the NF needs to be functionalized with hydrophobic groups. However,
the ultrahigh hydrophobicity is very difficult to obtain by modifying
the nickel directly owing to the inactive Ni surface. Gao prepared
a kind of superhydrophobic material based on cobalt nanowire-modified
nickel foam by an ammonia-evaporation-induced method.16 Liu’s group loaded the nanostructured Co3O4 on a nickel foam surface through a hydrothermal treatment
and then modified the foam with perfluorinated alkyl silane to reach
a water contact angle of 155°.17 Thus,
most modification procedures consist of two or three steps, and the
result foams are of hierarchical roughness. Wang presented a one-step
copolymerization method for fabricating octadecylamine-coated nickel
foam.18 Zhao reported a superhydrophobic
nickel foam surface obtained through coating with a candle soot and
sequential modification with polydimethylsiloxane.19 However, the pores of these foams can be easily blocked
due to the uncontrolled collapse defects of free-radical polymerization
during recycling oil or water, influencing the efficiencies of the
foam recycle and separation. It is important to develop promising
candidates for foam surface modification to obtain hydrophobic properties
and adsorption capacity.

Graphene nanosheets can supply a higher
surface-to-volume ratio
for foam functionalization. Lv reported a hydrophobic magnetic graphene-decorated
melamine foam for oil–water separation.20 Fenner coated polyurethane foam with graphene oxide (GO)
to produce hydrophobic and oleophilic sorbents.21 Feng developed a novel graphene fluffy nanofibrous scaffold
by combining liquid-assisted electrospinning and interface self-assembly
of graphene.22 Cao wrapped polyurethane
foam with graphene nanoribbons by modulating an interconnected GNR
network and introducing a polydimethylsiloxane coating.23 Chen coated an octadecylamine-grafted reduced
graphene oxide on the skeleton of melamine foam for use as an oil
adsorbent.24 However, graphene was only
used as a foam skeleton in these methods to obtain fluffy foams and
did not exhibit its excellent absorption ability. Therefore, it is
necessary to facilely synthesize metal foam with functionalized graphene
to increase the accessible surface area and adsorption capacity.

Herein, we developed an octyl GO-functionalized nickel foam using
a one-step method. The hydrophobicity of the proposed foam was evaluated,
and its adsorption capacity for several organics was also investigated.
The hydrophobic foam was used to separate oil or organic compounds
from oil–water mixture. The octyl GO-modified nickel foam showed
high-efficiency absorption performance for the oil–water separation.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization
Figure 1A shows the Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra of GO and octyl graphene oxide (C8-GO). It can be seen from the GO FTIR spectrum that there are OH
stretching vibrations at 3594 cm–1, C=O stretching
vibration at 1714 cm–1, C=C (unoxidized sp2CC bonds) stretching vibrations at 1610 cm–1, epoxy C–O vibrations at 1407 cm–1, and
alkoxy C–O vibrations at 1039 cm–1.25 After the GO was functionalized with octyl groups,
the FTIR spectrum of C8-GO indicates methylene asymmetric
and symmetric stretchings at 2915 and 2838 cm–1,
respectively. These observed peaks proved that C8-GO was
synthesized.

Figure 1 (A) FTIR spectra of (a) GO and (b) C8-GO NF;
(B) X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns of (a) GO and (b) C8-GO NF;
and (C) Raman spectra of (a) GO and (b) C8-GO NF.

The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of
GO and C8-GO are illustrated in Figure 1B. The characteristic peaks of 11.6, 21.6,
and 42.4°
in GO correspond to the (001), (002), and (111) crystal planes, respectively.
The pristine GO shows a (001) diffraction peak at 2θ = 11.6°
with an interlayer distance of 0.79 nm. The interlayer distance of
GO is higher than that of the corresponding graphite (0.34 nm), which
is attributed to the oxygen-rich groups on GO nanosheets.26 A (001) diffraction peak cannot be observed
in the XRD pattern of C8-GO, which may indicate the full
exfoliation or intercalation of GO by octyl groups.

The Raman
spectra of GO and C8-GO are depicted in Figure 1C. The characteristic
D and G band peaks of GO are observed at 1302 and 1579 cm–1, respectively. In the C8-GO curve, the D band appears
at 1274 cm–1, and the G band appears at 1585 cm–1. According to the relationship between the intensities
of the D and G band peaks, the ID/IG ratio in C8-GO is higher than the
GO ratio, suggesting that C8-GO has more structural disorder
and a larger number of defects because of the incorporation of octyl-modified
groups.

The morphology of GO and C8-GO was explored
by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) and is shown in Figure 2. The GO sheets have some transparent wrinkles
owing to the presence of oxygen-rich groups. The TEM image of C8-GO shows similar structures as GO, more curled edges, and
a dark transparent appearance, contributed to the reaction of the
GO surface with octyl chains.

Figure 2 TEM images of (A) GO and (B) C8-GO
NF.

To characterize the surface morphology of the foam,
scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images are shown in Figure 3. From Figure 3A, the pristine Ni foam has a porous and interconnected
framework structure with a smooth surface. The skeleton of C8-GO nickel
foam (C8-GO NF) became rough, and many nanomaterials were
coated on the foam after the Ni foam was modified with C8-GO (Figure 3B). From
the high-magnification SEM images of C8-GO NF (Figure 3C,D), the surface
morphology and the thickness of C8-GO-coated Ni foam were
observed, and a stable hydrophobic surface was formed.

Figure 3 Low-magnification SEM
images of (A) Ni foam and (B) C8-GO NF; and (C and D) high-magnification
SEM images of C8-GO NF.

2.2 Contact Angle
Figure 4A shows the photographs of the pristine Ni
foam and C8-GO NF. The color of the Ni foam after treatment
with C8-GO became black, in contrast to the original foam
due to the amount of C8-GO coated on the Ni foam surface.
Therefore, C8-GO NF maintained excellent hydrophobicity
and oil–water separation capacity. Figure 4B shows four kinds of quasi-spherical droplets
on the surface of C8-GO NF. The C8-GO NF demonstrated
high hydrophobicity to acid solution, NaCl solution, basic solution,
and water (droplets from left to right). The static water contact
angle (SWCA) test indicated that the SWCA was approximately 147°
± 3° on the C8-GO NF plane (Figure 4C). Moreover, a cooking oil
droplet could not be held on the plane and was immediately absorbed
by the C8-GO NF. Figure 4D shows the SWCA on the C8-GO NF surface
with increasing immersion time. The SWCA of the C8-GO NF
did not change much and was maintained at approximately 145°.
The SWCA result is a convincing proof of the water separation capacity.
The pristine Ni foam tended to sink to the bottom of the water because
of its high density and hydrophilicity. However, the C8-GO NF, with robust hydrophobicity, floated easily on the water surface
(Figure 5).

hydroxide solution (1 mol L–1), and water droplets

C8-GO NF.

and

2.3 Oil–Water Separation
A porous
structure is beneficial to the adsorption of liquid. The C8-GO NF is a good sorbent for adsorbing oil or organic compounds due
to its porous structure and the function of octyl GO. Figure 6 shows photographs of the oil–water
separation process. Once the C8-GO NF was immersed in water
containing a drop of trichloromethane (dyed with Oil Red O), the size
of the red droplet clearly shrank and finally disappeared. The trichloromethane
was quickly sucked into the C8-GO NF (the details can be
found in the Supplemental Video).

(dyed with Oil Red O) in water; (B) C8-GO NF was immersed
in chloroform–water mixture; (C) adsorption
of C8-GO NF for chloroform in water; and (D) the completion
of adsorption for chloroform.

The oil–water separation efficiency was
investigated to
evaluate the separation performance of the C8-GO NF. To
make the measurement more precise, the experiment was performed in
a stable closed zone to prevent disturbances from temperature, shaking,
and airflow. As shown in Figure 7A, the C8-GO NF performed well in the adsorption
of petroleum, dimethylbenzene, silicone oil, chloroform, diesel, and
hexane in water, with a separation efficiency of no less than 96.5%
for each. The results indicate that the C8-GO NF has high
hydrophobicity and excellent adsorption ability for organic solvents
owing to the porous structure of the Ni foam and the large surface
area of GO.

Figure 7 (A) Adsorption efficiency of C8-GO NF for the oil–water
mixture (n = 3) and (B) SWCA of C8-GO
NF after repeated separation tests (n = 3).

2.4 Durability of C8-GO NF
The durability of the C8-GO NF was also investigated in
separation efficiency experiments. The C8-GO NF can separate
water and benzene effectively, and the separation efficiency was 97.6%
for a water and benzene mixture. The C8-GO NF can be reused
by heating the foam at 80 °C for oil–water separation.
After 14 cycles of adsorption and desorption for benzene, the C8-GO NF still remained more than 95.3% separation efficiency.
Moreover, when performing the separation efficiency test, the SWCA
was recorded in each measurement. As shown in Figure 7B, the SWCA did not change much with the
increasing separation time, and all of the SWCAs were above 145°.
The results show that the C8-GO NF maintained high stable
separation efficiency and hydrophobicity after 14 repeated cycles
of use with a benzene–water mixture.

3 Conclusions
High hydrophobic C8-GO NF was prepared by coating octyl
graphene on a Ni foam surface. The two-dimensional nanoscale octyl
GO materials enhanced the surface roughness of the Ni foam and resulted
in low water adhesion properties. The resultant surface of the C8-GO NF exhibits hydrophobicity with an SWCA of 147°.
Furthermore, the C8-GO NF has excellent separation capacity
with high selectivity for sorption from oil or organic solvent–water
mixtures. Due to the excellent mechanical stability, facile preparation
procedure, and superior separation performance, the C8-GO
NF can be used as a very promising absorbent for the treatment of
oil spills and oil-fouling problems.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Ni foams were purchased
from Anping Huirui Factory (China). Graphite and triethoxyoctylsilane
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF), sulfuric acid, potassium permanganate,
and hydrogen peroxide were purchased from Tianjin Sennics Co. Ltd.
(China). All other chemicals were of analytical grade.

4.2 Synthesis of C8-GO
GO
was synthesized using the modified Hummer’s method.27 Graphite powder was added to a mixture of concentrated
H2SO4 and KMnO4. The mixture was
stirred at 80 °C for 5 h. Sulfuric acid (0.1 M) and hydrogen
peroxide were added to the mixture in an ice bath. After the reaction
proceeded for 2 h, the mixture was sonicated, centrifuged, and washed
with HCl (10%). The GO was dried under vacuum.

Two grams of
GO was ultrasonically dispersed into 300 mL of DMF and 5 mL of triethoxyoctylsilane.
The reaction was kept at 80 °C for 24 h. The residue was washed
with both ethanol and water. Then, the product was dried in a vacuum
oven at 60°C, and C8-GO was obtained.

4.3 Fabrication of C8-GO NF
C8-GO was dispersed into the DMF solvent. Ni foam was
ultrasonically cleaned using acetone and water. The cleaned nickel
foam was placed into the C8-GO dispersion and ultrasonicated
for 40 min. Then, the foam was dried under vacuum at 80 °C. The
above operations were performed in a cycle and repeated four times
to prepare C8-GO-modified nickel foam.

4.4 Characterization
The structure of
the samples was characterized by XRD patterns (D8 ADVAHCL instrument,
Bruker, Germany), FTIR spectroscopy (FTIR TENSOR 27 spectrophotometer,
Bruker, Germany), and Raman spectroscopy (Labram HR800 Raman system,
HORIBA, America). The morphologies of the samples were observed by
SEM (Sigma 300 microscope, ZEISS, Germany) and TEM (Tecnai F30G2 microscope,
FEI, Netherlands). The static water contact angles (SWCA) of the samples
were measured with a homemade apparatus. A 5 μL water droplet
was carefully dripped onto the samples, and the average SWCA value
was obtained by measuring 10 different positions on the sample.

4.5 Measurement of Separation Efficiency
The separation efficiency of the C8-GO NF was measured
for various oils and organic compounds. A weighted C8-GO
NF sample was placed into an oil–water mixture (5% v/v) and
allowed to absorb at room temperature. The separation efficiency (η)
was calculated from the ratio between the mass of the adsorbed oil
(or organic compound) after separation and the mass of the original
oil before separation. η was calculated according to the following
equation  where m0 is the
mass of the original oil before separation, and m1 is the mass of the collected oil after separation. In
addition, the above operation was repeated to measure the durability
of the C8-GO NF in the adsorption test.
