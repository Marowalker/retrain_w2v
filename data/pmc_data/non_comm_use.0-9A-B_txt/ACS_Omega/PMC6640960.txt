Most nonplatinum
group metal (non-PGM) catalysts for polymer electrolyte
fuel cell cathodes have so far been limited to iron(cobalt)/nitrogen/carbon
[Fe(Co)/N/C] composites owing to their high activity in both half-cell
and single-cell cathode processes. Group IV and V metal oxides, another
class of non-PGM catalysts, are stable in acidic media; however, their
activities have been mostly evaluated for half-cells, with no single-cell
performances comparable to those of Fe/N/C composites reported to
date. Herein, we report successful syntheses of zirconium oxynitride
catalysts on multiwalled carbon nanotubes, which show the highest
oxygen reduction reaction activity among oxide-based catalysts. The
single-cell performance of these catalysts reached 10 mA cm–2 at 0.9 V, being comparable to that of state-of-the-art Fe/N/C catalysts.
This new record opens up a new pathway for reaching the year 2020
target set by the U.S. Department of Energy, that is, 44 mA cm–2 at 0.9 V.

1 Introduction
The
cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a rate-determining
step in numerous fuel cells and air batteries, with the rate being
particularly low for polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) cathodes
because of their low operating temperature of ∼353 K and the
acidic environment (pH ≤ 1).1 Therefore,
a significant amount of platinum group metal (PGM) catalysts have
been used for lowering the overpotential. Although PEFC-powered vehicles
and stationary power generation units have been commercialized in
the last decade, the usage of PGM catalysts is still too high for
their widespread use.2,3 The economic impact of vehicles
motivated many researchers to develop non-PGM catalysts for PEFC cathodes;
however, the acidic environment and the high operating potential of
0.6–1.0 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) limit
the choice of non-PGM catalysts, with only two types extensively studied
in the last decade. The first type corresponds to iron/cobalt, nitrogen,
and carbon [Fe(Co)/N/C] catalysts, displaying high activity in both
half-cells with acidic solutions and single cells.3−14 These catalysts can be synthesized by one- or two-step pyrolysis
of Fe(Co)/N/C sources to produce nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon materials,
possessing at least three different active site types proposed to
date: (1) iron/cobalt atoms coordinated by two or four nitrogen atoms
located at the edge of graphitic carbon layers,3−10 (2) nitrogen-doped carbon species,5,11,12 and (3) iron carbide13 or iron particles14 encased in graphitic
carbon layers. As type-2 active sites are present in type-1 sites,
the discussion is sometimes controversial.3 It is generally accepted that the presence of iron/cobalt species
during pyrolysis is necessary to produce state-of-the-art highly active
sites, with the onset potential falling below 0.8 V versus RHE, when
such catalysts are synthesized in the absence of these species.3

Group IV and V metal oxides/oxynitrides
are another class of non-PGM
catalysts for PEFC cathodes. Catalysts of this type are resistant
to leaching in acidic media, as confirmed by using inductively coupled
plasma spectroscopy.15−19 These catalysts were discovered in the mid-2000s, approximately
40 years after Jasinski’s discovery of cobalt phthalocyanine,20 which is the origin of today’s Fe(Co)/N/C
catalysts. Because of the short development period of oxide/oxynitride
catalysts, their activity has mostly been evaluated by screening half-cells
containing acidic solutions,15−19,21−43 with the insulating nature of these species requiring much effort.
For example, micron-sized zirconium oxide powders and carbon black
were mechanically mixed, and then, the mass ratio and the type of
carbon black were optimized to form a catalyst layer on a glassy carbon
(GC) electrode.21 Because such optimizations
are time-consuming, recent studies have focused on the synthesis of
nanoparticles on conductive carbon materials. Nanosized titanium oxynitride,22−26 zirconium oxide,27,28 zirconium oxynitride,29 niobium oxide,27,30 niobium oxynitride,31 hafnium oxide,32 hafnium
oxynitride,19,33−36 aluminum-doped hafnium oxynitride,37 tantalum oxide,27,38−41 sodium-doped tantalum oxide,42 and tantalum
oxynitride43 have been supported on graphitic
carbon materials such as carbon black, carbon fibers, carbon nanotubes,
and stacked graphene sheets via various routes, and the activities
of these nanocatalysts have been evaluated in half-cells. However,
single-cell performances were reported only for carbon black-supported
zirconium oxynitride,29 other examples
being carbon-supported titanium nitride44 and carbon-support-free titanium oxynitride.45 The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) set the activity target
for non-PGM catalysts to be used in automotive PEFCs as 44 mA cm–2 at 0.9 V of Ohmic loss-free (IR-corrected) cell voltage.46 Although the cell performances reported in refs (29)(44), and (45) correspond to materials
with nonoptimized layer structures, the first two catalysts showed
open circuit voltages of less than 0.9 V,29,44 with only the last catalyst showing a current density of 1 mA cm–2 at 0.9 V,45 which is still
lower than the value exhibited by a state-of-the-art Fe/N/C catalyst,
24 mA cm–2.46 The relatively
low single-cell performance and the insulating nature of oxides/oxynitrides
questioned the feasibility of their use in automotive PEFC cathodes
because of the large currents involved.

Herein, we demonstrate both half- and single-cell activities
of
zirconium oxynitride (ZrOxNy) catalysts. Thermal decomposition of oxy-zirconium
phthalocyanine (ZrOPc) in the presence of multiwalled carbon nanotube
(MWCNT) supports was used to connect ZrOxNy nanoparticles to the above supports,
followed by pyrolysis in an atmosphere of gaseous NH3.
The thus obtained ZrOxNy–MWCNT catalysts displayed the highest single-cell performance
among oxide/oxynitride catalysts.

2 Results
and Discussion
Field emission transmission electron microscopy
(FE-TEM) imaging
of ZrOxNy–MWCNTs
after pyrolysis in an atmosphere of NH3 at 973 K (Figure 1a) shows that the
black nanometer-sized ZrOxNy particles are well-dispersed in light-gray MWCNTs;
however, some particles form aggregates on the order of several tens
of nanometers in size. Furthermore,
these ZrOxNy particles were also located on the amorphous carbon layer originating
from ZrOPc (Figure S1), indicating that
a modification of the synthetic route is necessary to produce size-uniform
ZrOxNy nanoparticles
on MWCNTs. Figure 1b reveals that these particles feature a single tetragonal ZrO2 phase. Bulk ZrO2 exists as a stable monoclinic
phase under ambient conditions, transforming into a tetragonal phase
at ∼1300 K47 and into a cubic phase
at ∼2600 K.48 These phase transitions
are reversible, and therefore, the monoclinic phase is stable after
quenching to room temperature, that is, under the conditions of X-ray
diffraction (XRD) pattern acquisition. However, tetragonal and cubic
phases can be stabilized for nonbulk ZrO2, that is, for
grain sizes of less than ∼100 nm and/or grains containing inherent
defects.49 The small size of ZrOxNy particles shown in Figure 1a and/or the oxygen
defects formed during NH3 pyrolysis are therefore responsible
for the stabilization of tetragonal ZrO2. Further, rhombohedral
Zr7O8N4 formed when the temperature
was increased to 1073–1173 K, transforming into cubic Zr2ON2 at 1273 K (Figure S2), which implies that nitrogen atoms were doped into the bulk at T > 973 K. NH3 pyrolysis at 973 K did not
significantly
affect the surface chemical states, as shown by X-ray photoelectron
Zr 3d and N 1s spectra in Figure 1c. The Zr 3d signal of the 973 K sample was split into
Zr 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 peaks by spin–orbit
coupling, appearing as a doublet at 182.6 and 184.9 eV assigned to
Zr4+ in ZrO2.50−52 Compared to the signals
observed before NH3 pyrolysis (dashed line), these peaks
were slightly shifted to lower binding energies, suggesting that the
surface was partially reduced by NH3 pyrolysis at 973 K.
Both samples showed noisy N 1s spectra, with peaks above 398 eV attributed
to zirconium oxynitride50−53 and nitrogen-doped carbon species.54 Because of a high degree of overlap, these peaks could
not be deconvoluted; however, it can be concluded that NH3 pyrolysis at 973 K did not significantly enhance the level of ZrO2 surface nitrogen doping. If ZrO2 powders are significantly
doped with nitrogen, the Zr 3d peak shifts lower further by ∼0.5
eV and a new peak at around 396 eV appears in the N 1s spectrum (Figure S3). These reference sample data also
indicate that the amount of nitrogen on the ZrO2 surface
of the 973 K sample is low. Similarly, the surfaces of MWCNTs and
ZrO2 were not significantly doped with the nitrogen atoms
of ZrOPc during the first pyrolysis in the presence of 0.05% O2. The surfaces of both polycrystalline zirconium55 and zirconium oxynitride51 are known to favor oxygen adsorption and form oxide layers,
which could also happen in the case of ZrOxNy particles studied herein.

Figure 1 (a) TEM image,
(b) XRD pattern, and (c) Zr 3d and N 1s spectra
of the ZrOxNy–MWCNT catalyst after NH3 pyrolysis at 973 K. For
comparison, Zr 3d and N 1s spectra of ZrOxNy–MWCNTs before NH3 pyrolysis are shown by dashed lines in (c).

The temperature and duration of NH3 pyrolysis
were systematically
optimized for ORR activity (Figure S4). Figure 2a shows rotating
ring-disk electrode (RRDE) voltammograms of the most active ZrOxNy–MWCNT
catalyst, the 973 K sample, and commercial Pt–C. The ZrOxNy–MWCNT
composite exhibited high activity, displaying an overpotential of
only 0.14 V higher than that of Pt–C. However, the ring current
density (jr) of ZrOxNy–MWCNTs was more than
twice as high as that of Pt–C, indicating that the ORR proceeded
via both two- (O2 + 2H+ + 2e– → H2O2) and four-electron pathways
(O2 + 4H+ + 4e– → 2H2O). To investigate the mechanism of ORR at ZrOxNy–MWCNTs in detail,
RRDE voltammograms were recorded for three different loadings (m) to calculate n, the number of electrons
transferred per oxygen molecule (see Experimental
Section), as shown in Figure 2b. The value of n increased with increasing m, suggesting that some H2O2 molecules
produced on the catalyst layer near the GC electrode side were further
electrochemically reduced to water (H2O2 + 2H+ + 2e– → 2H2O) or chemically
decomposed (H2O2 → H2O + 0.5O2) before passing through the thicker catalyst layers to be
detected at the ring electrode. During the synthesis of ZrOxNy–MWCNTs by NH3 pyrolysis at 973 K, a small amount of nitrogen atoms were
doped into both tetragonal ZrO2 and carbon species originating
from ZrOPc precursors and MWCNTs. To clarify the active sites of two-
and four-electron pathways, ZrOxNy particles were completely removed by treatment
with hydrofluoric (HF) acid (Figure S5).
The resulting activity did not reach the original one, and the ORR
proceeded mostly via the two-electron pathway on the ZrOxNy-free samples (Figure S5), indicating that the activity at disk
potentials (Ed) above 0.8 V was due to
ZrOxNy particles,
and nitrogen-doped carbon species in ZrOxNy–MWCNTs produced H2O2 at a lower Ed. The activity
of TaOxNy–MWCNTs
was lower than that of ZrOxNy–MWCNTs at all temperatures T and times t (see Figure S4 and related discussions), supporting the hypothesis that oxynitrides
determine the activity at a high Ed. Although
the iron contaminants were not detected by X-ray photoelectron Fe
2p spectra (Figure S5), the presence of
type-1 active sites on Fe/N/C, the so-called Fe–Nx sites, is not completely ruled out because some
iron impurity is present in our catalyst precursors, especially in
MWCNTs. However, all state-of-the-art Fe(Co)/N/C catalysts which exhibit
a high ORR activity close to that of Pt–C were synthesized
from the precursor mixture that was prepared by adding a non-negligible
amount of iron salts.4−10 Nitrogen-doped carbon species synthesized without adding iron/cobalt
salts are known to catalyze the ORR via a two-electron pathway,56−58 in line with the present results for ZrOxNy–MWCNTs. Furthermore, we also
reported that nitrogen-doped carbon black produced by NH3 pyrolysis catalyzes the formation of H2O2.59 Therefore, the selectivity for four-electron
reduction can be enhanced by the use of carbon-free oxynitride catalysts.

voltammograms of ZrOxNy–MWCNTs and commercial Pt–C
(50.8% Pt, w/w) catalysts and (b) n–Ed curves for ZrOxNy–MWCNTs with three different
loadings (m). In (a), the values of m for ZrOxNy–MWCNTs and Pt–C equal 1.39 and 0.04 mg cm–2, respectively, and the corresponding ZrOxNy loading of ZrOxNy–MWCNTs and the Pt loading
of Pt–C equal 0.96 and 0.02 mg cm–2, respectively.
The optimized conditions of NH3 pyrolysis used for the
synthesis of ZrOxNy–MWCNTs corresponded to T = 973 K and t = 6 h. Scans were performed under N2 and O2 at a rotation speed of 1600 rpm and a disk potential (Ed) scan rate of −5 mV s–1 (cathodic) in 0.1 mol dm–3 H2SO4 for ZrOxNy–MWCNTs and 5 mV s–1 (anodic) in 0.1
mol dm–3 HClO4 for Pt–C. The ring
potential (Er) was kept at 1.2 V. Both
geometrical disk and ring current densities (jd and jr, respectively) were background-corrected.

The activity of ZrOxNy–MWCNTs was
further evaluated for a single-cell cathode,
with the voltage versus current density (V–j) curve shown in Figure 3. As mentioned earlier, most oxide-based catalysts
exhibit no single-cell activity at V = 0.9 V, where
DOE set the target current density, with only the titanium oxynitride
catalyst showing an activity of 1 mA cm–2.45 The performance displayed by the present ZrOxNy–MWCNT
composite is the highest ever reported for an oxide-based catalyst,
with j = 10 mA cm–2 at V = 0.9 V without IR-correction. The corresponding open
circuit voltage and the maximum power density equals 0.96 V and 0.63
W cm–2 at V = 0.45 V, respectively,
being comparable to those of state-of-the-art Fe/N/C catalysts.60 The stability of ZrOxNy–MWCNTs in a single-cell cathode,
however, needs to be significantly improved (Figure S6); this issue is also similar to Fe/N/C catalysts.60,61 Nonetheless, such a high performance has never been reported for
iron-free oxide-based catalysts before, and the obtained results clearly
show that catalysts of this type, for example, ZrOxNy, are suitable ORR catalysts
for real PEFC cathodes.

3 Conclusions
In summary, ZrOxNy particles were supported on
MWCNTs using thermal decomposition
of ZrOPc at 1173 K under a flow of mixed H2/O2/N2 gas. Subsequent pyrolysis in an atmosphere of NH3 at 973 K produced highly ORR-active sites on ZrOxNy particles, with the
corresponding overpotential being only 0.14 V higher than that observed
for Pt–C in half-cells with acidic solutions. ZrOxNy also catalyzed the
ORR on single-cell cathodes, exhibiting the highest performance ever
reported for oxide-based catalysts.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Catalyst Synthesis
ZrOxNy–MWCNT catalysts
were synthesized by depositing ZrOPc on MWCNTs, followed by two-step
pyrolysis. ZrOPc powder (1.2 g; Dainichi Seika Chemical Mfg. Co.,
Ltd., Chuo-ku, Tokyo, Japan) and MWCNT powder (0.3 g; Showa Denko
K. K., Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan) were dispersed in N-methylpyrrolidone (300 cm3) using a homogenizer (Smurt
NR-600M, Microtec Co., Ltd., Funabashi, Chiba, Japan) for 600 s and
subsequently dried at 403 K in a vacuum oven. The obtained precursor
mixture was placed in a rotary quartz-tube furnace that was slowly
evacuated and purged with N2 gas. The precursors were heated
from room temperature to 1173 K at 20 K min–1 under
a nitrogen gas flow of 50 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm;
1 sccm = 1.67 × 10–8 m3 s–1). After a temperature of 1173 K was reached, N2 was replaced
by a mixed gas containing 2% H2, 0.05% O2, and
97.95% N2, and the above temperature was maintained for
7 h. The mixed gas was prepared using H2/N2 (4%
H2) and O2/N2 (0.1% O2) mixtures, the flow rates of both being 50 sccm. After 7 h of pyrolysis,
the gas was again switched to N2 until reaching room temperature
at an uncontrolled rate. The obtained powders were placed in an alumina
boat and placed in a horizontal quartz-tube furnace, which was slowly
evacuated and purged with N2 gas. The powder samples were
heated from room temperature to various temperatures T at a rate of 10 K min–1, kept at T for various time intervals t, and cooled to room
temperature at an uncontrolled rate. N2 (300 sccm) and
NH3 (100 sccm) gas flows were used for temperatures below
and equal to T, respectively. Unless otherwise noted, t = 6 h was used. To reveal the source of active sites,
ZrOxNy particles
were removed from ZrOxNy–MWCNTs exhibiting the highest activity (obtained after
NH3 pyrolysis at T = 973 K and t = 6 h) by treatment with HF acid at 353 K for 180 min,
and the catalyst samples were recovered by filtration. The above treatment
was repeated twice, and some HF-treated samples were further heated
under Ar gas under conditions identical to those used for the first
pyrolysis.

4.2 Physicochemical Characterization
The morphology of ZrOxNy–MWCNT catalysts was investigated using a
field emission
transmission electron microscope (TecnaiG2 F20, FEI Co., Minato-ku,
Tokyo, Japan), and their crystal structures were analyzed using an
X-ray diffractometer (XRD-6000, Shimadzu Co., Chukyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan;
Cu Kα radiation generated at 40 kV and 30 mA) for
a scan range of 15°–85° at a scan rate of 2°
min–1. The surface chemical states of catalysts
were analyzed using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (PHI 5000
VersaProbe, ULVAC-PHI, Inc., Chigasaki, Kanagawa, Japan) with an Al
Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV). Peak shifts due to surface
charge were corrected using the binding energy of C 1s at 284.8 eV.

4.3 Electrochemical Characterization
The catalyst
ORR activities were evaluated by obtaining cyclic voltammograms
(CVs). Catalyst powder (30 mg), an ultrapure water/isopropanol mixture
(1.5 cm3, 1:1 w/w), and 0.5% Nafion solution (50 mm3, prepared by diluting a 5% (w/w) Nafion solution with ultrapure
water) were sonicated for 600 s. The obtained catalyst slurry was
drop-cast onto a GC rod (5.2 mm diameter, Tokai Carbon Co., Minato-ku,
Tokyo, Japan) and dried. The mass of the catalyst coated on the GC
rod was determined by measuring the rod mass before and after the
coating procedure. The ORR selectivity of the best catalyst was evaluated
by analyzing the RRDE voltammograms. An aliquot of the catalyst ink
prepared using 1-hexanol as the solvent was drop-cast onto a GC disk
(6 mm diameter)–platinum ring (7 mm inner diameter and 9 mm
outer diameter) electrode (Nikko Keisoku, Atsugi, Kanagawa, Japan).
Various catalyst loadings (m) were used to evaluate
the ORR mechanism at a constant Nafion to catalyst ratio (0.1).

Electrochemical measurements were taken using a three-electrode cell
in oxygen- or nitrogen-saturated 0.1 mol dm–3 H2SO4 at 303 K. The catalyst-coated GC rod or GC
disk–ring electrode, a GC plate, and an RHE were used as working,
counter, and reference electrodes, respectively. A potentiostat (PS08,
TOHO Technical Research, Aoba-ku, Yokohama, Japan) and a bipotentiostat
(CH Instruments, Inc., ALS Model701C, Austin, TX, USA) were used to
clean the working electrode surface by repeated scans from 0.05 to
1.2 V under oxygen at a rate of 150 mV s–1 for 150–400
cycles to reach a steady state. After cleaning, CVs were recorded
from 1.2 to 0.05 V at a scan rate of 5 mV s–1 under
oxygen and nitrogen. RRDE voltammograms were recorded using an identical
disk potential (Ed) range and scan rate
at a constant ring potential of 1.2 V and a rotation speed of 1600
revolutions per minute (rpm). Under both oxygen and nitrogen, the
steady state was reached within three cycles, and therefore, data
collected from the third cycle were used for the evaluation of ORR
activity. The difference in the geometric current densities obtained
under nitrogen (jN) and oxygen (jO) per unit mass of catalyst was taken as a
measure of ORR activity, jM = (jO – jN)m–1. The number of electrons transferred
per unit oxygen molecule (n) was calculated as follows 1  where Id and Ir denote the disk and ring currents, respectively,
after the background correction described above, and N is the collection efficiency (0.381) determined by the reduction
and oxidation of ferrocyanide ions at the disk and ring electrodes,
respectively, using 0.1 M KNO3 solution containing 2.1
mM K3[Fe(CN)6]. As a reference, RRDE voltammograms
of a commercial carbon-supported platinum (Pt–C) catalyst (50.8%
w/w platinum on Ketjen black, TEC10E50E, Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo K.
K., Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, Japan) were recorded under identical conditions,
except for the scan direction and electrolyte, from 0.05 to 1.2 V
(anodic) and 0.1 mol dm–3 HClO4 because
(bi)sulfate adsorption on platinum catalysts is known to block the
initial adsorption of O2 to decrease the activity.62

4.4 Single-Cell
Tests
Inks for cathode
catalyst layers were prepared using the ZrOxNy–MWCNT catalyst showing
the highest level of activity (T = 973 K, t = 3 h), Ketjen black, 5% (w/w) Nafion ionomer solution,
water, and n-propanol at a ZrOxNy–MWCNTs/Nafion ionomer/Ketjen
black mass ratio of 9:6:1. First, ZrOxNy–MWCNT and Ketjen black were
mixed at the mass ratio of 9:1 without a solvent using a zirconia
planetary ball mill with 45 cm3 of a grinding bowl and
90 balls of 5 mm diameter to achieve suitable conductivity. After
the dry ball milling at 120 rpm for 60 min, 5% (w/w) Nafion ionomer
solution and a solvent were added to the solid mixture. The solvent
was prepared by blending water and n-propanol at
water/n-propanol volume ratio of 1:1, and the amount
was controlled to achieve the solid content in the ink to 10–12%
(w/w). The second wet ball milling was conducted at 180 rpm for 60
min. Inks for anode catalyst layers were prepared from commercial
Pt–C (TEC10E50E, Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo K. K., Chiyoda-ku,
Tokyo, Japan), 20% (w/w) Nafion ionomer solution, water, and n-propanol. Cathode inks were coated on the gas-diffusion
layer (Sigracet 35 BC, SGL Carbon Japan Co., Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan)
and dried in an oven at 343 K. The catalyst-coated gas-diffusion layers
were hot-pressed onto one side of a Nafion membrane (NR-211, DuPont
Co., Wilmington, DE, USA), whereas the anode catalyst layers were
prepared on the opposite side by a decal transfer method. Following
hot-pressing, the resultant membrane electrode assembly (MEA) was
allowed to cool to room temperature. The Pt–C loading at the
anode equaled 0.6 mg cm–2, whereas the ZrOxNy–MWCNT loading
at the cathode equaled 10 mg cm–2.

The V–j curves for a single cell with
the fabricated MEA were recorded galvanostatically using an electronic
load (As-510-4, NF Corp., Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan). All measurements
were performed at 353 K. The H2 and O2 reactant
gases were humidified by passing through separate water baths at 353
K. The flow rate of both H2 and O2 was 500 sccm,
with back pressures (gage) of 0.2 and 0.3 MPa used for the anode and
cathode, respectively. Stability of ZrOxNy–MWCNTs was further investigated
using another MEA with two different protocols: one is a simple stability
test with a constant j at 0.1 A cm–2 for 2 weeks and the other is an accelerated degradation test (ADT)
in a load cycle mode proposed by Fuel Cell Commercialization Conference
of Japan (FCCJ).63 The ADT protocol is
as follows: V was first set at 0.6 V (load) for 30
s. After the initial holding at 0.6 V, V was switched
to 1.0 V (idle) immediately and kept for 3 s, then again switched
to 0.6 V (load), and kept for 3 s. The rectangular wave-voltage cycle
was repeated until it reached the cycle number, N, of 10 000 under conditions identical to those used for V–j measurements except for the
following two parameters: (i) the cathode gas was N2 at
a flow rate of 500 sccm and (ii) both anode and cathode gases were
supplied without back pressure. The cycle was stopped when N reached 10, 20, 30, 50, 100, 200, 300, 500, 1000, 2000,
3000, 5000, and 10 000; then, the cathode gas was switched
to O2 to obtain V–j curves with the back pressures as mentioned earlier.
