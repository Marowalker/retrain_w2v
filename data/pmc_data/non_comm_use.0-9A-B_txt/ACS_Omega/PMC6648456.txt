==== Body
1 Introduction
Phthalates such as di-n-butyl phthalates, di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate,
and di-n-octyl phthalate (DOP) are widely used in
poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) products such as food packaging materials,
toys, and medical instruments.1 These synthetic
organic chemicals are easily released from PVC products with increasing
of time. Human reproductive and cardiovascular systems will be affected
when people ingest or absorb the phthalates. Recently, some studies
reported that the phthalates had a link with oxidative DNA damage,2 sex steroid hormones of children, and seminal
plasma of reproductive-aged men.3−5 In order to decrease the potential
threat of phthalates on people, many biomass resources have been used
to produce plasticizers such as jatropha oil,6 glycerol,7 cardanol,8 lactic acid,9 and tung oil.10,11 In addition, the strategy of covalent attachment of different plasticizers
onto a PVC matrix to obtain internally plasticized PVC materials was
also reported.12−15

In recent years, the use of biomass resources has gained interest
in producing plasticizers. Rosin is an important and renewable raw
material in the chemical industry, which originates from pine trees.
It is estimated that one million metric tons of rosin was produced
in a year. The main component of rosin is rosin acid, which accounts
for 90% of all components. Rosin can be used to synthesize many kinds
of fine chemical products via the active groups such as the conjugated
double bond and carboxyl acid.16 Rosin
and its derivatives have served as alternatives to petrochemical products
to produce cross-linking agents,17 biobased
plastics and elastomers,18 epoxy resin,19 some polymers, and monomers.20 Dehydroabietic acid (DA) is an important rosin derivative.
The chemical structure of DA has the same benzene ring structure and
a similar alkane structure compared with phthalate plasticizers; it
is worth trying to synthesize different plasticizers using DA and
combining with other renewable products such as castor oil methyl
ester, cardanol, and triethyl citrate because these renewable products
with special functional groups such as ester, benzene ring, and hydroxyl
groups have been reported to synthesize plasticizers.21−24

In this study, three kinds of rosin-based plasticizers were
designed
and synthesized. First, DA was employed to react with oxalyl chloride
to obtain chloride dehydroabietic (CD); then, the obtained CD was
used to react with cardanol, castor oil methyl ester, and tributyl
citrate to produce rosin-based plasticizers with different branched
chains. The synthesis route is showed in Figure 1. The obtained rosin-based plasticizers are
with different branched chains and the same benzene rings and similar
alkane structure compared to phthalate plasticizers. The chemical
structures of all rosin-based plasticizers were characterized with 1H NMR and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR). Plasticizing
properties and solvent resistance of PVC films plasticized with different
relative amounts of the rosin-based plasticizers were investigated.

ester plasticizer (ECTR) was obtained after purifying by silica gel
and rotating evaporation.

2.7 Preparation of PVC Films
PVC and
plasticizers were dissolved in 40 mL of THF according to the formulations
in Table S1. The mixture was stirred at
50 °C for 20 min until the solution presented transparent. Then,
the solution was poured into glass Petri dishes (10 cm diameter).
PVC films were obtained after drying in a constant temperature drying
box at 60 °C for 24 h to completely remove residual THF.

2.8 Characterizations
FT-IR spectra of
rosin-based plasticizers and PVC films plasticized with different
plasticizers were studied using a Nicolet iS10 FT-IR (Nicolet Instrument
Corp., USA) Fourier transformed infrared spectrophotometer. FT-IR
spectra were collected in the range of 4000–500 cm–1. Infrared-characteristic absorption peaks were annotated using OMNIC
software (Thermo Electron Corporation, USA).

1H nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) of rosin-based plasticizers were investigated
on an AV-300 NMR spectrometer (Bruker Instrument Corp., Germany) at
a frequency of 400 MHz. CDCl3 was used as solvent and tetramethylsilane
was used as an internal standard in the process. MestReNova software
(Santiago de Compostela, Spain) was used to handle the NMR data.

Thermal stability of PVC films was investigated using a TG209F1
TGA thermal analysis instrument (Netzsch Instrument Corp., Germany)
in N2 atmosphere (50 mL/min). The heating rate was 10 °C/min.
Thermal degradation data were collected from 40 to 600 °C.

The glass transition temperature (Tg)
of PVC films was investigated using a NETZSCH differential scanning
calorimeter (DSC) 200 PC analyzer under N2 atmosphere.
The temperature ranged from −20 to 100 °C at a heating
of 20 °C/min. The DSC data were collected after removing thermal
history. Five milligrams of PVC samples were weighed and sealed in
a 40 μL aluminum crucible, and immediately tested using DSC
measurement.

Tensile strength and elongation at break of all
PVC films were
detected according to GB/T 1040.1-2006 (China) at room temperature
using an E43.104 Universal Testing Machine (MTS Instrument Corp.,
China). The strain rate was 10 mm/min and static tension was 50 N.

Solvent resistance of rosin-based plasticizers was investigated
according to ASTM D5227. PVC films after weighing were immersed in
distilled water, 10% (v/v) ethanol solution, 30% (w/v) acetic acid
solution, and petroleum ether. The test condition was controlled at
23 ± 2 °C and the relative humidity was restricted at 50
± 5%. After 24 h, the solvent-extracted PVC films were dried
and reweighed. The weight loss (WL) was calculated according to eq 1. 1  where W1 was the
initial weight of PVC films and W2 was
the final weight of the test PVC films. The extraction loss data were
collected using the average value of five test samples.

The
solubility parameter of PVC and rosin-based plasticizers were
investigated according to the Small eq 2.25,26 2   3  where δ = solubility parameter, CED
= cohesive energy density, Vi = molar volume, ΔE = energy of vaporization,
and Fi = molar attraction
constant. M = molecular weight and ρ = density
of the plasticizers or chain unit of PVC. D = the
difference of δ between PVC and plasticizers.

The flexibility
of PVC films was evaluated indirectly by calculating
the plasticizing efficiency of rosin-based plasticizers based on the
glass transition behaviors of PVC and PVC plasticized with rosin-based
plasticizers. Plasticizing efficiency of rosin-based plasticizers
was calculated using eq 4.27 4  where EΔTg = plasticizing efficiency of rosin-based
plasticizers, ΔTg = the reduction
in Tg from PVC to plasticized PVC films.

3 Results and Discussion
The rosin-based plasticizers
were characterized with 1H NMR and FT-IR, which are shown
in Figure 2. In Figure 2(1), the multiple
peaks at around 6.96–7.24
ppm are attributed to the protons of benzene rings.18 The signal at 2.85 ppm is attributed to protons of cycloparaffin.
The peak at 2.20 ppm originates from the protons of methylidyne, which
connects to the side chain of DA.28 The
multiple peaks of protons of methyl appear at around 0.86–0.95
ppm.29 The signals at 1.2, 1.4, and 1.6
ppm are attributed to protons of other methylene groups. Figure 2(2) shows 1H NMR of CD; characteristic absorption peaks of CD do not present
distinctly different compared to DA. However, compared to the FT-IR
spectrum of DA and CD, as seen from Figure 2(6), the disappearance of hydroxyl groups
at 3435 cm–1 and the appearance of the strong signal
of C–Cl at 735 cm–1 in the FT-IR spectrum
of CD indicate that CD was obtained. Figure 2(3) shows the 1H NMR of ECMR;
the signals at around 5.35–5.61 ppm are protons of olefin,
which originate from castor oil methyl ester.30 More signals corresponding to the protons of methylene appear at
around 1.4–2.2 ppm compared to CD, which originated from castor
oil methyl ester. Compared with the FT-IR spectrum of CD and ECMA,
as seen from Figure 2(6), the signal at 1729 cm–1, which is attributed
to ester groups, becomes stronger than CD, and the signal attributed
to C–Cl at 735 cm–1 cannot be observed. Characteristic
absorption peaks of double bonds appear at 3009 cm–1, which is derived from castor oil methyl ester. These results indicated
that ECMR was obtained. Figure 2(4) shows 1H NMR of ECTR; two strong signals at
4.2 and 3.9 ppm are attributed to protons of H3C–CH2–O– and −CH2–C=O–, respectively.15 The peak at 1729 cm–1 corresponding
to ester groups is the strongest among the three kinds of rosin-based
plasticizers in Figure 2(6), and the peak at 735 cm–1 attributed to C–Cl
vanished. The 1H NMR of ECR is shown in Figure 2(5); the peaks at 5.0 and 5.5
ppm are assigned to protons of olefin, which originated from the long
alkane chain of cardanol.31 The signals
at around 6.85 and 7.5 ppm are attributed to protons of benzene rings,
which originated from CD and cardanol. The signals are the strongest
among three kinds of rosin-based plasticizers, because there are more
benzene rings in the chemical structure of ECR. In the FT-IR spectrum
of ECR, the peak at 3007 cm–1 is attributed to a
double bond, which is derived from the long alkane chain of cardanol,
and the peak at 735 cm–1 corresponding to C–Cl
vanished.24 Taken together, these results
supported the conclusion that rosin-based plasticizers were obtained
with well-designed molecular architectures.

The miscibility and plasticizing efficiency of the rosin-based
plasticizers are evaluated via glass transition temperatures (Tg) through DSC and dynamic mechanical analysis
(DMA) measurement. Figures 3 and 4d show DSC curves of PVC and
plasticized PVC films. Figure 3 shows that there is one Tg for
all plasticized PVC films, which indicates that PVC and rosin-based
plasticizers are completely miscible. PVC has a Tg value of 85.6 °C. The Tg of plasticized PVC films decreases gradually with more rosin-based
plasticizers added in PVC films, which indicates that rosin-based
plasticizers decrease some of the intermolecular forces between PVC
chains.32 The Tg for R4, MR4, and TR4 is 27.2, 37.2, and 14.2 °C, indicating
that plasticizing efficiency of ECTR is the highest among the three
kinds of rosin-based plasticizers. In order to prove the conclusion,
the plasticizing efficiency of all rosin-based plasticizers was calculated
according to eq 3. The
plasticizing efficiency values are summarized in Table 1. The value for ECMR, ECR, and
ECTR is 69.7, 57.8, and 85.5%, respectively. For rosin-based plasticizers,
ECR with a rigid benzene ring structure has the lowest plasticizing
efficiency, and ECTR with a high degree of branching has the highest
plasticizing efficiency. DMA was also used to detect Tg of PVC materials, because DSC is less sensitive than
DMA to detect Tg. The obtained DMA results
are shown in Figure 4a–c. Only one tan δ peak of PVC and soft PVC materials
can be observed in Figure 4a–c, which indicated that PVC and graft rosin-based
plasticizers form a homogeneous mixture, and no free rosin-based plasticizers
exists in the PVC matrix. These tan δ peaks correspond to Tg. The DMA results are basically consistent
with DSC data.

The infrared absorption peak of carbonyl
group of plasticizers
will shift to a lower position when it was blended with PVC.33,34 The carbonyl group shifts that are larger in the FT-IR spectrum
indicate that the miscibility between PVC and plasticizer is better.35 Intermolecular force that originated from dipole–dipole
interaction of groups with electron clouds and H–C–Cl
causes the shift of the carbonyl group infrared absorption peak. Groups
such as ester groups, benzene ring, and ether bonds containing electron
clouds are important factors to form miscible blends. The miscibility
and interaction between PVC and rosin-based plasticizers was investigated
using FT-IR. As seen from Figure 3d–f, carbonyl group absorption peaks of all
plasticized PVC films shift to a lower frequency compared to those
of rosin-based plasticizers. For PVC films plasticized with ECMR,
the carbonyl group absorption peak shifts from 1730.6 to 1726.8 cm–1. For PVC films plasticized with ECR, the carbonyl
group absorption peak shifts from 1729.9 to 1727.6 cm–1. The shift for PVC films plasticized with ECTR is from 1728.4 to
1724.1 cm–1. The shift of PVC films is in the order
of TR4 (4.3 cm–1) > MR4 (3.8 cm–1) > R4 (2.3 cm–1). The order is the same with
plasticizing
efficiency values of rosin-based plasticizers.

Tensile tests
can provide visual data such as tensile strength
and elongation at break to evaluate the plasticizing efficiency of
rosin-based plasticizers. Figure 5 presents the tensile test results. As we concluded,
ECTR has the highest plasticizing efficiency among the three kinds
of rosin-based plasticizers based on DSC, DMA, and FT-IR. As seen
from Figure 5, the
tensile strength of all PVC films decreases gradually with more rosin-based
plasticizers blending with PVC, and the elongation at break of all
PVC films increases gradually. The addition of rosin based plasticizers
decreases the entanglement of PVC chains. PVC materials become flexible
when rosin based plasticizers are blended with the PVC. However, rosin-based
plasticizers present different plasticizing efficiencies. For ECMR,
elongation at break increases from 180 to 307%. The value for ECR
is from 180 to 279%. ECTR shows the best elongation at break, which
increases from 108 to 346%. Tensile strength for ECMR, ECR, and ECTR
decreases from 30 to 12.5, 15.7, and 8.1 MPa, respectively. At the
same weight ratio, ECTR gives the best plasticizing efficiency. The
conclusion is consistent with the DSC, FT-IR, and theory based on
the chemical structure of rosin-based plasticizers.

of PVC materials. (b) Tensile strength

Thermal degradation of
plasticized PVC films has been investigated.
As seen from Figure 6, thermal degradation processes of all PVC films have two stages;
the first stage is at around 260–350 °C, which is attributed
to pyrolysis of PVC dechlorination.36,37 The second
stage at around 400–540 °C is due to the destruction of
chains and forms cross-linking, cyclization, and cleavage compounds.38 TGA data of all PVC films are summarized in Table S2. These data include the 5% weight loss
temperature (T5), the 50% weight loss
temperature, char residue, weight loss at around 260–350 °C,
and weight loss at around 400–540 °C. As seen from Table S2, for PVC films plasticized with ECMR,
the thermal stability of PVC films decreases with more ECMR blending
with PVC. T5 decreases from 276.5 to 265.0
°C, and T50 decreases from 344.6
to 322.7 °C. Because the thermal stability of ECMR is poor at
above 250 °C, benzene rings of ECMR are thermally degraded completely.
The weight loss of PVC at around 260–350 °C is 62.5%,
but the value for MR4 is down to 41.2%. On the contrary, the weight
loss at around 400–540 °C increases from 27.2 to 32.05%.
The weight loss at around 400–540 °C originates from thermal
degradation of ECMR. The branched chain of the ECMR (castor oil methyl
ester), which is derived from castor oil, degrades rapidly at above
367 °C.39,40 Then, thermal degradation of
MR4 produced more char residue than PVC. For ECR, the thermal degradation
process of PVC films shows the same trend compared with MR films.

curves of PVC films plasticized with ECMR. (b)TGA curves

ECMR. (e) Extraction test results of PVC films plasticized with ECR.
(f) Extraction test results of PVC films plasticized with ECTR.

T5 and T50 decrease from 276.5 and 344.6
to 252.8 and 325.1 °C, respectively.
Thermal degradation of benzene rings in the ECR occurs at this temperature
range. Weight loss of R4 at 260–350 °C is down to 40.2%.
On the contrary, weight loss at around 400–540 °C increases
from 27.2 to 30.0%, which is attributed to thermal degradation of
ECMR, because double bonds in the alkyl chain of the cardanol group
of ECR are thermally unstable, which is converted into more stable
epoxides at above 260–350 °C, and thermal degradation
occurs at around 400–540 °C.41 The char residue produced by R4 is 13.05%, which is more than that
of PVC (5.8%). The thermal degradation process of TR films presents
a different trend compared with MR films and R films. T5 and T50 are down to 173.2
and 322.6 °C, weight loss of TR4 at 260–350 °C is
down to 40.7%, but weight loss at around 400–540 °C is
little changed; the value is around 25.2%, because ECTR is almost
in complete thermal degradation at 400 °C.

Migration behavior
was investigated by evaluating the weight loss
of PVC films in four different solvents [distilled water, 10% (v/v)
ethanol solution, 30% (w/v) acetic acid solution, and petroleum ether],
which was designed according to the environments where plasticized
PVC materials are used. The excellent solvent resistance of plasticizers
can keep properties of plastic products long stable. Solvent resistance
results of rosin-based plasticizers are showed in Figure 6. DOP presents the poorest
solvent resistance among the four different plasticizers in four different
solvents. The most weight loss of PVC-D is in petroleum ether; the
value is 12.3%, whereas PVC-D only lost 1.8% of its weight in distilled
water. For PVC films plasticized with rosin-based plasticizers, weight
loss increases in four solvents with more rosin-based plasticizers
blending with PVC. However, the three kinds of rosin-based plasticizers
show better solvent resistance than DOP. For ECR, R4 lost 1.4, 7.0,
3.2, and 2.7% of its weight in distilled water, petroleum ether, 10%
(v/v) ethanol, and 30% (w/v) acetic acid, respectively. Weight loss
for MR4 in distilled water, petroleum ether, 10% (v/v) ethanol, and
30% (w/v) acetic acid is 1.2, 5.0, 2.2, and 2.3%, which indicates
that solvent resistance of ECMR is better than that of ECR. TR4 lost
the most weight among the three kinds of PVC films; the weight loss
for TR4 is 1.3, 7.6, 4.1, and 3%, respectively, which illustrated
that solvent resistance of ECTR is worse than that of ECR and ECMR.
On the basis of these results, we can conclude that the plasticizer
with lower molecular weight may have poor solvent resistance, because
the order of molecular weight for DOP and rosin-based plasticizers
is DOP (390) < ECTR (574) < ECR (602) < ECMR (612).

Solubility parameter (δ) is an important value to evaluate
the compatibility between polymers and plasticizers. Polymers can
be well dissolved in plasticizers when δ of the polymers and
the plasticizers is the same or the difference is less than ±3.07
(J/cm3)1/2.25,26 The δ
value and the difference of δ between PVC and plasticizer (D) for PVC, DOP, and rosin-based plasticizers was calculated
according to eqs 2 and 3, and compared in Table 2. The obtained δ of ECR, ECMR, and
ECTR is 7.71 (J/cm3)1/2, 7.50 (J/cm3)1/2, and 8.46 (J/cm3)1/2, respectively.
The D value for ECTR [1.20 (J/cm3)1/2] is the least among the three kinds of rosin-based plasticizers,
but is greater than DOP [0.77 (J/cm3)1/2], illustrating
that compatibility between ECTR and PVC is better than that of ECR
and ECMR, but worse than that of DOP. The order of compatibility is
DOP > ECTR > ECR > ECMR; the results are consistent with
previous
results of DSC, FT-IR, and tensile tests.

and Rosin-Based Plasticizers

Free volume theory is used to explain
why the Tg of the polymer decreases when
the plasticizer is blended
with the polymer. It was noted that the specific volume of the polymer
decreased when temperature was down until it reached Tg; then, the specific volume almost kept unchanged, and
free volume caused the increase of specific volume above Tg.42−44 Pure PVC presents hard and rigid, because pure PVC
chains are tangled together and have strong intermolecular force (F′) between the chains, there is not any free volume
existed in PVC matrix. The addition of plasticizers increase the distance
of PVC chains and decrease the intermolecular force(F′′), then produce free volume between polymer and plasticzier.
In this study, the plasticizing mechanism of rosin-based plasticizers
according to free volume theory can be observed in Figure 7e,f; the addition of rosin-based
plasticizers increases the free volume of PVC chains and promotes
the PVC chains to move. The behavior decreases tensile strength and
increases elongation at break of PVC films. However, DOP and rosin-based
plasticizers showed different plasticizing efficiencies, because DOP
and ECTR with smaller relative molecular mass and relatively more
carbonyl group, electron cloud on benzene rings, and oxygen atoms
than ECR and ECMR increase F″ and decrease F′, thus presenting a higher plasticizing efficiency
than ECR and ECMR.

to
free volume theory and lubricity theory. (a–d) Branched chains’
movement and electron cloud distribution of ECMR, ECTR, ECR, and DOP;
(e,f) force between PVC molecules and plasticizer molecules.

The plasticizing mechanism of
rosin-based plasticizers can be explained
according to mathematical models for plasticization, which was reported
by Mauritz and Storey.42,45 In the theory, the decrease of Tg was caused by branched chain movement. The
same molecular mass plasticizers with a higher branched chain will
provide more excellent plasticizing properties than linear plasticizers.37 In this study, molecular structure DOP and ECTR
have higher branched chains than ECR and ECMR, as seen from Figure 7a–d, which
was more effective to reduce the Tg of
PVC films, thus giving a higher plasticizing efficiency. In addition,
the long branched chain of ECR and ECMR may tangle with PVC and produce
an anti-plasticization effect on PVC films.

Lubricity theory
holds that plasticizers play the role of lubrication
and improve the movement of PVC chains in plasticized PVC materials.43−45 As seen from Figure 7e,f, surface irregularities and internal entanglement of PVC prevent
PVC chains from moving freely. Rosin-based plasticizers were used
to dissolve PVC chains as solvents, which made PVC chains move freely
by decreasing the F′. DOP and ECTR dissolve
PVC more easily because F″ was stronger than
ECR and ECMR, thus producing a higher plasticizing efficiency.

4 Conclusions
In conclusion, we developed three kinds
of rosin-based plasticizers
with differently branched chains as alternative plasticizers for preparing
flexible PVC films. The plasticizing efficiency value for ECMR, ECR,
and ECTR was 69.7, 57.8, and 85.5%, respectively. Rosin-based plasticizers
with rigid benzene rings and long alkane chains had a negative impact
on plasticizing efficiency and miscibility; the carbonyl groups of
rosin-based plasticizers were responsible for plasticizing efficiency
and miscibility. At the same weight ratio, ECTR gave the best plasticizing
efficiency among the three kinds of rosin-based plasticizers. The
order of solvent resistance for DOP and rosin-based plasticizers is
DOP (Mw = 390) < ECTR (Mw = 574) < ECR (Mw = 602)
< ECMR (Mw = 612); the order of compatibility
between PVC and plasticizers is DOP > ECTR > ECR > ECMR,
illustrating
that relative molecular mass of plasticizers is closely related with
solvent resistance and compatibility.
