The control of underwater bubble behavior on a solid
surface has great research significance. However, the control of the
spontaneous directional transport and collection of numerous underwater
bubbles remains a challenge. A new technique of a metal mesh with
superhydrophobic/hydrophobic properties is demonstrated here, which
creates a wettability gradient coupled with a microporous array by
means of pulsed fiber laser ablation and chemical modification of
the aluminum sheet. The resultant wettability surface effectively
achieved the spontaneous movement of bubbles along the directional
wettability gradient (superaerophobicity to aerophilicity) and through
the metal mesh (aerophilicity to superaerophilicity) in the direction
of decreasing free energy. Theoretical analysis accounted first for
the spontaneous sliding of bubbles on the wettability gradient surface
as a result of the action of an unbalanced surface tension force and
second for the spontaneous transition of bubbles from the aerophilic
to superaerophilic side as a result of the combined action of Laplace
pressure and buoyancy. A device with the capability of directional
transportation and collection of underwater bubbles was designed based
on the samples with a wettability gradient and a superhydrophobic/hydrophobic
microporous array as the core components. The potential application
is laser ablation of wettability gradient surfaces and metal mesh
with superhydrophobic/hydrophobic properties for directional transportation
and collection of underwater bubbles.

1 Introduction
Bubbles in aqueous media
are a common encounter in our daily lives, both in nature and in engineered
processes. Bubbles have great significance for life science engineering
and industrial production and application to realize the manipulation
or collection of underwater bubbles. They are advantageous for the industrial wastewater treatment by manipulating
bubbles to reach the effect of pollution treatment;1 the use of solid–liquid interface nanobubbles caused
by fluid boundary slippage and to reduce the flow of viscous drag;2 a sample with in situ tunable bubble wettability
can be used as a light switch;3 humpback
whales living in the depths of the ocean produce bubbles to hunt for
food;4 and at the bottom of the ocean bed,
a large amount of natural gas is present, which is important for human
energy. However, bubbles also result in many adverse effects, for
example, bubbles in microfluidic control chips cause obstruction;5 bubbles mixed with intravenous fluids cause increased
pressure in pulmonary arteries;6 bubbles
attached to the surface of the electrochemical reaction catalyst reduce
the reaction efficiency;7 and bubbles attached
to diving goggles or cameras will cause blurred vision.8,9

In nature, many living organisms have the characteristics
of directional capture and transport of water droplets on their surfaces.
The main reason is that these living organisms have unique multilevel
micro–nanostructures on their surface. Such multilevel micro–nanostructures
can generate Laplace pressure gradient and surface free energy gradient.
Inspired by nature, researchers control the directional movement of
droplets by constructing asymmetric microstructures or wettability
gradients.10,11

Superhydrophobic/superhydrophilic
solid surfaces in air are generally superaerophilic/superaerophobic
in aqueous medium.12,13 This particular wetting phenomenon
opens up the possibility of manipulating solid surface air bubbles
in aqueous media. Generally, a solid surface has a certain degree
of hydrophilicity, and water molecules can be easily captured underwater
to form a water film. The repulsion of the water film to the bubble
makes the friction between the bubble and the hydrophilic surface
very small, and the bubble is difficult to be fixed on the hydrophilic
surface or moved along the solid surface in a directional way, which
is extremely unfavorable to the application of the bubble in drag
reduction. Researchers used the characteristics of repulsive/adsorptive
bubbles on superaerophobic/superaerophilic surfaces to collect, self-assemble,
and reduce drag of underwater bubbles.14−17 The behavior of bubbles in waterborne
media is dominated by upward buoyancy, which greatly impedes the transportation
of bubbles in any other direction. Jiang et al. successfully created
a superhydrophobic copper cone by the chemical coating of low surface
tension on a conical shape to transport microbubbles spontaneously
and directionally from the tip of the cone to the base underwater.18 Chen et al. manufactured microhole-arrayed polydimethylsiloxane
with controllable wettability gradient for ultrafast underwater bubble
unidirectional self-transport.19 Hu et
al. successfully fabricated a channel-controlled Janus membrane by
simultaneous laser ablation and nanoparticle deposition for underwater
bubble manipulation.20 According to the
different characteristics of hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface wettability,
Hu et al. prepared thin rings with hydrophobic and hydrophilic alternation
on the solid surface, which were used to nail the gas to reduce drag.21 Although the superhydrophobic copper cone can
realize the directional delivery of microbubbles, the limitation in
the delivery distance of 1–2 cm for single bubbles makes the
continuous long-distance directional transport of bubbles remain a
challenge at large. Previous studies have also shown that spontaneous
and directional transport may occur between two bubbles of different
volumes on the surface of superhydrophobic porous materials.22,23 However, the direction and efficiency of bubble transport depend
on the difference in the volume of two bubbles. Therefore, the realization
of single large bubble spontaneous and directional transport is still
an urgent challenge. This work focuses on bioinspired wettability
gradient solid surfaces through the construction of roughness gradient
and free energy gradient to achieve the directional transport and
collection of bubbles in water-based media.

Surface roughness
gradient and free energy gradient can be created by chemical methods
such as vapor-phase diffusion,24 photodegradation,25 and gradual immersion method.26 However, because of the poor controllability of chemical
methods, it is difficult to obtain uniform gradient change. In recent years, the development and application of ultra-short-pulse
technology, the nonlinear absorption effect of materials on ultrafast
laser can be utilized to obtain the machining accuracy far less than
the size of a laser-focused spot, and the construction of abundant
micro–nanostructures on the surfaces of semiconductors, brittle
materials, metals, polymers, ceramics, and biological materials.27−29 Laser manufacturing is a fast, precise, and flexible process to
greatly improve the preparation efficiency and precision of functional
micro–nanostructure surfaces. Lasers make it possible to prepare
a micropore array with a wettability gradient. During laser texturing,
the sample surface is generally perpendicular to the laser beam, which
is usually focused on the sample surface to minimize the spot diameter
and maximize the energy density absorbed by the sample surface, so
as to optimize the interaction between light and substance. When the
processing surface deviates from the focal plane, the laser spot becomes
larger and the energy density decreases exponentially with distance
from the focal plane. The shape of the laser-textured surface is closely
related to the energy density injected by the laser. By adjusting
the distance between the machining surface and focal plane, the surface
with different roughnesses can be machined. It has been proved that
by tilting the sample, the surface of the sample can be textured by
laser to produce a roughness gradient.30

This work fabricated a device for the directional transportation
and collection of underwater bubbles by laser ablation and chemical
modification of an aluminum sheet. A uniform gradient of micro–nanostructures
and micropore array was created on the sheet, which was then coated
with stearic acid and laser-ablated to partially remove some stearic
acid. The resultant surface was a wettability gradient and superhydrophobic/hydrophobic
microporous array. This work provides reference for laser processing
of wettability gradient surfaces and superhydrophobic microporous
arrays, as well as a new method for the directional transportation
and collection of underwater bubbles.

2 Experimental Methods
2.1 Preparation of Sample
Aluminum sheets
(purity 99.6%, size 40 mm × 30 mm × 0.2 mm) were cleaned
with ethanol and deionized water for 15 min to remove contaminants
from the sample surface. A pulsed fiber laser scanning system (wavelength
1064 nm, pulse duration 5 ns, and repetition rate 90 kHz) was used
to fabricate gradient roughness surfaces and microporous arrays. The
matrix of microchannels and microholes was designed via the graphic
interface of a control software, where the laser beam was focused
normally to the substrate surface. The laser processing system is
shown in Figure 1a.
The laser passes through the attenuator and beam expander. Subsequently,
it is coupled with a galvanometer scanner and focused by a F-θ
lens to the aluminum substrate.

Figure 1 Schematic diagram of (a) laser processing
system and (b) sample preparation process.

The laser beam emitted by the laser amplifier is
coupled by the scanner and focused on the aluminum surface through
the F-θ lens. The designed grid patterns are directly textured
on the aluminum substrate. The laser scanning is performed line-by-line
in the horizontal and vertical directions with an equivalent distance
between the adjacent scanning lines. All processing is performed in
an atmospheric environment. The sample preparation process is completed
in five steps, as shown in Figure 1b. The first step begins by the design of laser ablation
grids within region A (15 mm × 20 mm). There is a roughness gradient
created throughout region A as the aluminum sheet was fixed on a stainless
steel plate and end B was elevated by a glass slide at an angle of
2°. The focal length of the laser was focused at end A; thus,
the ablation area resulted in end A having a stronger ablation and
gradually lesser ablation toward the A–B interface. In the
second step, microhole arrays were created in region B (area 10 mm ×
15 mm, array 12 × 8 matrix, microhole diameter 600–800
μm, and microhole center-to-center distance 800–1000
μm). The sample was placed flat, at no elevation (the glass
slide was removed). In the third step, laser grids were ablated in
region B (ablation repetition times = 1) and also on the reverse side
of region B (ablation repetition times = 3). This creates a metal
mesh with hydrophobic/aerophilic (front of region B) and superhydrophobic/superaerophilic
(back of region B) properties. Thereafter, the fourth step was a chemical
modification on the entire sample, whereby the sample was immersed
in stearic acid ethanol solution with a concentration of 0.01 M for
60 min. The purpose of this process was to reduce the surface free
energy. Thereafter, the sample was removed, dried, and mounted in
the same sample placement position as in step 1. Last, in the fifth
step, laser grids were ablated to remove the stearic acid film partly
within region A. This regained the surface free energy gradient. The
laser processing parameters are shown in Table 1.

2.2 Characterization
The surface morphology
of the laser-textured samples was studied by means of a scanning electron
microscope (Gemini SEM 500, ZEISS, German). The roughness of the sample
surface was analyzed using a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM,
Smartproof 5, ZEISS). The water contact angle (WCA) and the underwater
bubble CA of the rough aluminum sheet surface induced by the pulse
fiber laser were measured using an optical CA meter (KSV CAM 200).
To measure the WCA, a 4.0 μL drop of deionized water droplet
was generated and deposited on the filter surface (in air) using a
micrometric syringe by the sessile drop technique. To measure the
CA of underwater bubbles, the sample was carefully immersed inside
water and a 3.0 μL volume of air bubble was deposited on the
sample surface. The final CA value was averaged by measuring three
different points on the same surface at ambient temperature. The dynamic
process of water droplets and bubbles on the sample surface was captured
by IDS Imaging Systems (IDS, Germany) and Macro zoom lens (Nikon 60
mmf/2.8 d).

2.3 Directional Transport and Collection of Bubbles
An in-house device was set up as shown in Figure 2a to demonstrate the directional transportation
of underwater bubbles. The sample was affixed beneath the fixture
installed on the test tank to hold the sample horizontally. The system
includes a horizontal regulator and a syringe connected to an automatic
syringe pump. The horizontal regulator maintains the sample at a suitable
level and the syringe was connected to an automatic syringe pump.
Air is injected into the sample surface through a microinjection syringe
that is affixed perpendicular to the bottom of the sample. The bubble
released through the needle rises vertically to the superaerophobic
end (end A) of the wettability gradient surface. The image acquisition
system comprised a CCD camera, macrozoom lens, and a light-emitting
diode light source, at a shooting speed of 50 fps. The camera system is connected to the computer, and the captured images
are input into the computer through the video transmission acquisition
card, and the computer is displayed and collected in real time through
the control software provided by IDS.

Figure 2 Experimental setup for (a) directional
transportation and (b) collection of underwater bubbles.

Another in-house device was set up to demonstrate
the collection of bubbles underwater (Figure 2b). The sample was affixed to the bottom
of a transparent plexiglass tube with a diameter of 20 mm and a base
diameter of 50 mm, and the microporous array was located at the bottom
of the tube diameter. The plexiglass tube was clamped and immersed
into the water tank. The top of the plexiglass tube was sealed and
attached to a soft tube to enclose the system. To verify the generation
of bubbles, the other end of the soft tube is immersed into a water-filled
beaker to collect the bubbles. A microair pump was connected to the
microsyringe needle through a thin flexible tube and the tip of the
needle points perpendicular to the base of the glass tube. The bubbles
rose up toward the superaerophobic end (end A) and were directionally
transported toward the aerophilic end (end B) of the sample surface
through the microneedle, so as to observe the bubble emission of the
thin flexible tube buried in the beaker.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Effect of Laser Irradiation on Surface Morphology
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images confirmed the surface
morphology on the laser-ablated aluminum sheet (Figure 3). The front and back of the samples are
shown in Figure 3a,b,
respectively. As shown in Figure 3a, there is a uniform color variation from dark to
light (zone 1 to zone 3) because of the degree of surface oxidation
and formation depth of microgroove area of laser ablation. Zone 1
is located at the starting end of region A, where the laser is in
focus; hence, the degree of oxidation is greatest (Figure 3c,d). Zone 3 is located close
to the interface of region A–B, where the laser is out of focus;
hence, the degree of oxidation is lesser (Figure 3g,h). This is due to the laser ablation of
the sample surface to form oxide and different surface roughnesses
of the nonreflective properties. From the low-magnification SEM images
in Figure 3c,e,g corresponding
to the three regions, the microsquare grid formed by vertical and
horizontal laser scanning can be seen, which is due to the microgroove
grid formed by laser ablation. Magnified SEM images in Figure 3d,f,h showed that the edge
of the microgroove and the unablated area of the laser have significant
deposition of micro- and nanoparticles. Micro- and nanoparticles are
thought to have formed from rapid cooling of the fluid ejected from
the molten zone.31,32 Comparing the further magnified
SEM images of zones 1 to 3, the ablated grooves within zone 1 is the
deepest, with the side wall showing the most distinct V-slope and
the micro- and nanoparticles being the most abundant. On the other
hand, zone 3 has the shallowest groove and the least amount of micro-
and nanoparticles.

Figure 3 Photos of the (a) front and (b) back of the sample. SEM
images of the roughness gradient surface at zone 1 (c,d), zone 2 (e,f),
and zone 3 (g,h) correspond to the low- and high-magnification SEM
images of zone 1, zone 2, and zone 3, respectively.

The roughness of the sample surface at zone 1 was
measured to be twice that of zone 3, with the average roughness of
zone 1 around 2.6 μm, while that of zone 3 was around 1.3 μm.
The roughness decreases uniformly along the X-axis
(Figure S1). The results showed that laser-induced
roughness can be controlled by adjusting the sample position perpendicular
to the laser beam direction. The surface of the microhole array on
the back of the sample was composed of micropores and microsquare
grids. The boundary of the microsquare grid unit was formed by laser
ablation to form a V-shaped groove, which is similar to that observed
within zone 1. The edge of the trench forms a projection for nanostructure
delamination, and there are more micro- and nanostructures than those
in the central unablated area of the grid. There are also abundant
micro- and nanoparticles distributed in the side walls of micropores
(Figure S2). The abundant micro- and nanostructures
on the surface of the microhole array enable it to have superhydrophobic
properties.

3.2 Surface Wettability
The oxidized
aluminum at different positions was investigated for its gradient
wettability properties. The start of region A was taken as the origin
and the gradient directionality from zone 1 to 3 as the X-axis. Process 1 in Figure 1b created microstructures and microgrooves on the surface
with gradient roughness showing superhydrophilicity. It is observed
that the water droplets of volume 1.0 μL in zone 1 spread out
rapidly, and the diffusion speed along the X-axis
was much faster than that along the Y-axis. The droplets
were instantly absorbed by the surface, and the water traces were
distributed in thin strips along the X-axis (Video S1). The distribution shape of droplets
in zone 3 is the same as that in zone 1, but the diffusion direction
is opposite, and the velocity is slow. Similarly, the surface infiltration
area of a 1.0 μL water drop in zone 1 is larger than that of
zone 3.

This indicated that the surface roughness structure
caused the aluminum sheet to change from hydrophilic to superhydrophilic
and the water droplets to have the characteristic of preferential
diffusion along the gradient direction of roughness. After processes
2 and 3, the water CA was 0°, characterized by superhydrophilicity.
After chemical modification, the relation between the water CA of
the surface roughness gradient and the position of the X-axis is shown in Figure 4a. The water CAs of zone 1 and zone 3 were 161.5 ± 2
and 98.3 ± 1.5°, respectively. It indicated that the greater
the surface roughness, the greater the abundance of micro- and nanostructure
present on the surface and thus the larger the water CA. Therefore,
the construction of a roughness gradient surface is an effective way
to achieve a wettability gradient. The water CA on the surface of
the aluminum sheet microhole array (region B) was measured to be 134
± 1° (Figure 4b), while the reverse side of region B had a water CA measurement
of 161.0 ± 2° (Figure 4c), which was similar to the water CA in zone 1.

Figure 4 WCA on sample
surface (a) at different positions on the roughness gradient surface,
(b) at region B microhole array with microgrids textured (repetitive
times = 1), and (c) at the back side of region B with microgrids textured
(repetitive times = 3).

Stearic acid is a weak acid anionic surfactant
with −COOH group and easily soluble in ethanol, acetone, and
other organic solvents. This was used as a chemical modifier as it
can react with the solid surface and graft long-chain alkyl groups
with hydrophobicity and low surface energy on the solid surface to
reduce the free energy of the solid surface.33 Stearic acid removal by laser ablation is a process in which the
stearic acid film grafted on the sample surface is vaporized by the
high energy of laser. By controlling the laser energy density and
laser scan spacing, stearic acid can be removed in whole or in part
without damaging the surface geometry of the sample. The removed parts
of the stearic acid on the surface with gradient roughness from zones
1, 2, and 3 have water CAs measured to be about 13, 42, and 58°
(Figure 5a and Video S2). On the contrary, the underwater bubble
CAs were measured to be about 150, 123, and 96°, respectively
(Figure 5b). According
to Young’s equation, it can be deduced that the hydrophobic
surface is aerophilic, while the hydrophilic surface is aerophobic
in waterborne medium, and the water CA in air and the underwater bubble
CA are approximately complementary to each other in principle.34 This conclusion is consistent with the experimental
results. The stearic acid in the roughness gradient region was removed
by laser ablation, and the water CAs on the front and back of the
microporous array were not affected (Figure 5c,d). This indicates that a low-energy laser
ablation can possibly remove some or all stearic acid in the ablation
zone and form a free energy gradient surface. The removal of stearic
acid is related to the energy of laser ablation and the elevation
angle of the sample.

surface, (b) underwater bubble CA on a wettability-graded surface,
(c) WCA on the positive surface of the microhole array, and (d) WCA
on the back side of the microhole array.

3.3 Transportation and Collection of Underwater
Bubbles
After the bubble is released from the microneedle,
it rises vertically to the position of zone 1, and it is approximately
spherical in shape on the sample surface. Immediately, it slides to
zone 3. The shape of the bubble gradually transitions from spherical
to near-spherical during the sliding process, and when it reaches
zone 3, where the microporous array lines the region, the bubble is
captured and it spreads out to form a gas film adhering to the lower
surface of the microporous array. As bubbles accumulate on the lower
surface of the microporous array, the gas film gradually expands and
forms a larger bubble. When the gas accumulates to a certain extent,
it will pass through the micropores and emerge from the upper part
of the micropores to form the upper convex air layer (Figure 6a). With the continuous delivery
of bubbles, the air layer above the micropores gradually forms bubbles,
and the bubbles become larger with their shapes constantly changing.

Figure 6 Experimental
process of micropore array surface transport of bubbles. (a) Bubbles
passing through the microholes form a film on the upper surface, (b–h)
bubbles gradually increase in volume permeating through the top surface
of micropores, and the (i) gas film left after the bubble breaks away
from the upper surface.

The shape of the bubble encountering the micropore
was investigated as shown in Figure 6b–g. When a bubble is injected below the micropore,
the shape of the bubble above changes and reaches a stable equilibrium
quickly. When the bubble on the top surface of the microporous array
is large enough, the buoyancy force is sufficient to overcome the
adhesion force on the surface of the sample and instantaneously breaks
away, floating on the top of the water tank (Figure 6h and Video S3). A layer of gas film was observed to remain at the upper surface
of the micropores (Figure 6i). If the sample is oppositely oriented, the bubbles cannot
be transferred from the superaerophilic side through the micropores
to the aerophilic side and was observed to slide out of the sample
edge and rise to the top of the water tank after a large amount of
surface accumulation (Video S4). This indicated
a dependence on wettability of the surface for the successful transfer
of bubble from the lower to the upper surface of the micropore array.
Previous studies have only shown that air bubbles can only be reached
from the hydrophilic side, through the microholes to the superhydrophobic
side.17 Our study has shown that the surface
wettability gradient from zone 1 to 3 (superaerophobic to aerophilic),
as well as from the lower to upper surface of the microporous array
(aerophilic to superaerophilic), is a crucial factor in the single-directional
transportation of air bubbles.

The core component of the underwater
bubble collecting device is the sample fabricated by laser ablation.
The base of the plexiglass tube was immersed in water. After the bubble
was injected vertically below zone 1, it rose to zone 1 and slid to
zone 3 through the wetting gradient surface. Under the action of inertia,
it continued to slide along the surface of the microporous array and
was captured by the surface of the microporous array to form an air
layer. The individual bubbles float upward and were collected when
they reach the opening of the plexiglass tube, which was connected
to a hose immersed into a water beaker to visually verify the effect
of the bubble collection. Bubbles were observed to emerge from the
underwater hose in the beaker (Video S5), which demonstrated the successful and direct method to collect
gas bubbles. The efficiency of gas collection needs to be further
investigated, and it is postulated to be dependent on the rate of
bubble release from the microneedle, the spacing and diameter of the
micropores in the array, the thickness of the aluminum sheet, and
the depth which it is submerged at, as well as the transport speed
of the collected gas.

3.4 Mechanism of Spontaneous and Directional Transport
of Gas Bubbles
The mechanism of directional transport of
bubbles on the surface with underwater gradient wettability is shown
in Figure 7a.

Figure 7 Diagram schematic
of bubble movement mechanism in (a) force analysis of bubbles on the
wettability gradient surface and (b,c) schematic diagram of force
analysis of bubbles on the superhydrophobic surface and hydrophilic
surface of the microporous array, respectively.

The behavior of the horizontal transportation of
gas bubble on the sample is primarily determined by the wettability
gradient force arising from the unbalanced surface tension force (FS), the drag force of water (FD), and the hysteresis resistance (FH). When bubbles are released from the microneedles and raised
to the surface of the sample, the initial velocity in the horizontal
direction (X-axis) is zero. At this juncture, the
force in the X-axis direction is mainly the unbalanced
surface tension. Let the small displacement along the X-axis direction in which the gradient surface energy decreases be
with respect to x, and the change in the interface
energy is 1  where ΔG is the interface
free energy, γSV is the solid–gas surface
tension, γSL is the solid–liquid surface tension,
and lSVL is the length of the three-phase
contact line. The driving force (FS) of
the bubble on the surface of the gradient surface energy aluminum
sheet is the same as the rate of change of interface energy on the
surface of the aluminum sheet (eq 2). 2  and according to Young’s equation 3  where θ is the three-phase CA. Then 4  where θ1 and θ2 are the front and backside CAs of the bubble. Equation 4 is consistent with the previous
report.30 On the aerophobic surface, the
free energy decreases along the X-axis, so the CA
on both sides of the bubble becomes θ1 > θ2, and since FS > 0, the unbalanced
surface tension produces the driving force for the bubble to slide
toward the direction where the free energy decreases. FH can be expressed as follows35 5  where θR and θA are the receding and advancing CAs, respectively. In the
case of a horizontally fixed sample, θR ≈
θA, therefore FH is extremely
small. When FS > FH, the bubble acceleration in the direction of the surface
energy decreases. FD can be demonstrated
as follows 6  where CD is the
drag coefficient of water, ρ is the density of water, ν
is the transportation velocity of gas bubbles, and A is the cross-sectional area of gas bubbles. As the bubble velocity
increases, so does the resistance to water. At that moment, the force
of the bubble reaches equilibrium, and the movement speed no longer
increases. When the bubbles reach the surface of the micropore array,
under the action of Laplace pressure difference, they will rapidly
merge with the gas film captured on the surface, and then spread out
to form a larger gas film.23 Continuous
delivery of bubbles makes the gas film larger and larger, forming
large bubbles that adhere to the lower surface of the micropore array
(Figure 6a). Whether
a large bubble can break through the water film above the micropores
and form a convex shape above the microholes to realize the bubble
transfer is dependent on the wettability of the upper and lower surfaces
of the micropore array. The surfaces of the superhydrophobic/hydrophilic
micropore arrays are easy to transport bubbles,17 but the moving bubbles can easily slip off the surface
of the microporous array because of inertia. Therefore, the surfaces
of the superhydrophobic/hydrophobic micropore arrays are able to easily
capture bubbles and also provide favorable channels for bubble transfer.
The wettability on both surfaces (lower and upper) of the micropore
array is different, and the corresponding water CA is also different.
For a superhydrophobic/hydrophilic micropore array, the upper surface
WCA is greater than 150°. The convexity of the water–gas
interface faces down (Figure 7b). For a hydrophilic/hydrophilic array, the upper WCA <90°,
liquid–gas interface of convex is upward directional (Figure 7c). For a gas bubble
in aqueous medium, the Laplace pressure PS acting on the bubble is 7  where r is the surface tension
of water, R is the radius of curvature of the liquid–gas
contact surface, C is the perimeter of the micropore, A is the cross-sectional area of the microhole, and θ
is the WCA. From eq 7, on the superhydrophobic surface, θ > 90°, the direction
of PS is upward. When the diameter of
the microhole is fixed, the larger the WCA, the greater the PS will be, and it is easier for the bubbles
to push apart the water film on the surface of the micropores and
pass through the microhole under the combined action of buoyancy and
Laplace pressure. On the contrary, the hydrophilic surface has WCA
θ < 90°, cos θ > 0. Hence, the direction of PS is downward, which is opposite to the buoyancy
force, and the resistance prevents the bubble from passing through
the micropores. Therefore, it was crucial for the upper surface to
exhibit superhydrophobicity to facilitate the gas bubbles passing
through the micropores, while hydrophilicity or superhydrophilicity
hindered the gas from passing through the micropores. Similarly, the
bigger the bubble on the lower surface of the microporous array, the
bigger the radius of curvature of the liquid–gas interface,
therefore the larger the PS is. This is
indicative of larger buoyancy force on the gas bubble, which is more
favorable for it to pass through the micropore. Consequently, the
superhydrophobic upper surface and hydrophilic lower surface are conducive
for the directional transportation of bubbles and the transfer of
bubbles from the lower to the upper surface.

4 Conclusions
The surface exhibiting
wettability gradient and a superhydrophobic/hydrophilic micropore
array (to trap bubbles more easily, the lower surface is hydrophobic),
was fabricated by nanosecond laser ablation of aluminum sheets, and
the behavior of underwater bubbles on the prepared surface was investigated.
The laser-induced gradient surface roughness was hydrophobic after
chemical modification. The wettability gradient surface demonstrated
the directional transportation of the bubbles along the direction
of the decrease in free energy. The superhydrophobicity/hydrophilicity
of the upper/lower surface of the laser-ablated micropore array can
generate upward Laplace force, which is conducive to the transfer
of bubbles from the lower to the upper surface through the micropores.
The results and analysis demonstrated that the surface wettability
gradient combined with the superhydrophobic/hydrophilic micropore
array can realize the directional transportation and collection of
underwater bubbles. The preparation method of the device and application
to the directional transport and transfer of underwater bubbles have
important significance for potential application for the control of
underwater bubbles.
