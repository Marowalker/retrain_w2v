The molecular orientation
of organic molecules of zinc phthalocyanine
(ZnPc) in single-component films on copper iodide (CuI) substrates
can be controlled to achieve a molecular orientation lying flat on
the substrate (flat-on) owing to π–d orbital interactions
between the ZnPc molecules and the CuI. A 3-fold enhancement in the
performance of organic photovoltaic cells has been reported by introducing
a CuI interlayer between a ZnPc:fullerene (C60) bulk heterojunction
(BHJ) film and the substrate. However, the mechanism underpinning
the resultant solar cell performance enhancement was unclear. Herein,
we report on the results of using in situ reflection absorption spectroscopy
measurements during the vacuum deposition of coevaporated ZnPc:C60
BHJ films on various substrates to investigate the ZnPc molecular
orientation. Our results revealed that the flat-on molecular orientation
of ZnPc molecules in ZnPc:C60 BHJ films on CuI interlayers and flat-on
ZnPc substrates can be successfully identified via the strong π–π
interactions between the BHJ film and the substrate. The π–π
interactions between individual ZnPc molecules are stronger than the
π–d interactions between ZnPc molecules and CuI in coevaporated
ZnPc:C60 films, as is evident from the molecular orientation of ZnPc,
as determined by in situ reflection absorption spectroscopy. Our findings
demonstrate that precisely controlling the molecular orientations
of the films could enhance organic photovoltaic (OPV) performance.
The present work provides important insights that will enable the
design of higher performance OPV cells.

Introduction
In recent years, research
in the field of thin-film organic photovoltaics
(OPVs) toward commercialization has progressed significantly since
the introduction of donor–acceptor interfaces.1−7 The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure that is widely used as an
active layer in OPVs provides not only a large interfacial area for
exciton dissociation but also an interpenetrated nanoscale network
for charge carrier transport.8 A power
conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 10% has been reported in solution-processed
BHJ OPV cells, which use a blend of a polymer and an acceptor.4,9,10 In contrast, coevaporation methods
are able to precisely control layer thicknesses in BHJ structures
on the order of nanometers by controlling the evaporation rates and
times.11 However, it is very difficult
to control the molecular orientation, morphology, and crystallinity
in coevaporated BHJ films by changing the evaporation parameters.
A BHJ structure is created owing to several molecular characteristics
such as the interaction forces between molecules and between molecules
and substrates, molecular aggregation ability, and molecular adsorption
and desorption abilities on the substrate.12−14 To further
enhance OPV performance, understanding the precise control of the
interactions between the molecules and between the molecules and the
substrate is key as it will allow the production of the ideal BHJ
structure without carrier traps, which are created by molecular aggregations,
grain boundaries, and areas that deviate from the ideal donor–accepter
molecular ratio.15

By controlling
the interactions between molecules and between molecules
and substrates, it is already possible to control the molecular orientation
in films evaporated onto a substrate.16 Small-molecular organic semiconductors, such as zinc phthalocyanine
(ZnPc), adapt a standing-up (edge-on) molecular orientation on conventional
substrates, that is, glass, indium-tin-oxide (ITO), and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene
sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) substrates. On copper iodide (CuI) substrates,
ZnPc molecules take on a molecular orientation lying flat on the substrate
(flat-on) owing to the π–d interactions between the ZnPc
molecules and CuI.17,18 Not only does the flat-on molecular
orientation of the ZnPc molecules improve the light absorption coefficient,
it also allows for efficient charge transfer in the BHJ film. As a
result, we were previously able to obtain an OPV cell with the 3-fold
higher PCE of 4.56% by introducing a CuI film between the coevaporated
ZnPc:C60 BHJ film and the substrate.19 We
assumed that the higher light absorption coefficient was obtained
by controlling the molecular orientation of the ZnPc molecules to
be flat-on in the coevaporated ZnPc:C60 BHJ film owing to π–d
interactions. However, the study of the molecular orientation of ZnPc
in coevaporated ZnPc:C60 BHJ films has not yet been demonstrated with
common techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), owing to the low crystallinity and amorphous
state of ZnPc in coevaporated ZnPc:C60 BHJ films. Yokoyama et al.20−23 measured the molecular orientation in organic amorphous films via
variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements. The molecular
orientations of various small-molecule organic semiconductors for
organic light-emitting diodes have been successfully measured both
for amorphous single-component films and in doped films. Those results
highlight that it might be possible to find an efficient optical measurement
method to identify molecular orientation in coevaporated BHJ films.

In this study, we used a facile, in situ infrared reflection absorption
spectroscopy (IR-RAS) measurement method to identify the molecular
orientation of ZnPc in coevaporated ZnPc:C60 BHJ films. We also used
this technique to study the difference between the strength of the
π–π interactions between ZnPc molecules and the
strength of π–d interactions between ZnPc molecules and
CuI in coevaporated ZnPc:C60 BHJ films.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows a
schematic illustration of the IR-RAS measurement setup to identify
the molecular orientation angle of ZnPc in ZnPc:C60 BHJ films in situ
during evaporation. The chemical structures of ZnPc and C60 are shown
in Figure 2a,b, respectively.
ZnPc is a planar molecule with a high crystallinity, and C60 is a
spherical molecule that is a good electron acceptor.

the molecular orientation angle during evaporation.

IR-RAS measurements were performed by reflecting
infrared light
off the substrate, exciting the aromatic C–H out-of-plane bending
vibration and in-plane bending vibration of the ZnPc molecules on
the substrate (as shown in Figure 3) owing to the absorption of light at a specific wavelength.
Only the moment perpendicular to the substrate of those vibrations
was detected by applying p-polarized light to the incident infrared
light. When most ZnPc molecules are parallel to the surface, we see
out-of-plane bending vibration, whereas when most ZnPc molecules are
perpendicular to the surface, we see the in-plane bending vibration.
From the results of the IR-RAS measurements, we can quantify the molecular
orientation of the ZnPc molecules using the orientation parameter, S    where θ is the angle
between the long
molecular axis and the direction perpendicular to the substrate surface, R is the peak intensity ratio of the aromatic C–H
out-of-plane bending vibration {A(o-o-p)} and the in-plane bending
vibration {A(i-p)} in the film, and Rr is the value of R in a KBr pellet.24,25 Yokoyama et al.20 revealed that when S = −0.5, the resultant molecules are completely
parallel to the surface. In contrast, when S = 1,
the molecules are completely perpendicular to the surface. They investigated
the molecular orientation in organic amorphous films using the optical
anisotropy of the films using variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry.21−23 ZnPc takes on an amorphous state in coevaporated ZnPc:C60 BHJ films.
Conversely, ZnPc adopts a crystal state in a single-component ZnPc
film. However, its crystallinity is low because the evaporations were
performed at room temperature in this work. No peak shift of the aromatic
C–H bending vibration was seen in the IR-RAS spectra of the
coevaporated ZnPc:C60 films compared to that for single-component
ZnPc films owing to the low crystallinity of ZnPc. Thus, we analyzed
the observed IR-RAS spectra assuming that the aromatic C–H
out-of-plane bending vibration is perpendicular to the molecular plane.
With regard to spectra fitting, the peak position and intensity were
calculated on the basis of observed raw spectral data using a graphing
and data analysis software package (Origin).

Figure 3 (a) Out-of-plane and
(b) in-plane bending vibrations of the aromatic
C–H unit.

The IR-RAS spectra of
single-component ZnPc films formed on PEDOT:PSS
or CuI substrates are shown in Figure 4a,b. Seoudi et al.26 revealed
that the bands centered at 730 and 1120 cm–1 are
assigned to the out-of-plane and in-plane bending vibrations of the
aromatic C–H bond, respectively. The values of S determined from the IR-RAS measurements were 0.73 on the PEDOT:PSS
substrate and −0.13 on the CuI substrate (Figure 4c). In the single-component
ZnPc film on the PEDOT:PSS substrate, the ZnPc film displays a high
crystallinity with molecules stacked in the edge-on orientation because
of the weak interactions between the ZnPc molecules and the substrate.
Conversely, the single-component ZnPc film on the CuI substrate shows
a large out-of-plane bending vibration peak (730 cm–1) for the aromatic C–H unit, which suggests that the number
of flat-on ZnPc molecules was larger owing to π–d interactions.
The XRD spectra of single-component ZnPc films show that the diffraction
peaks correspond to the edge-on ZnPc crystalline order (2θ =
6.9, d = 12.8 Å) and the flat-on ZnPc crystalline
order (2θ = 27.9, d = 3.2 Å) (Figure S1).27 The
ZnPc grown on the PEDOT:PSS substrate exhibits edge-on ZnPc peaks,
whereas the ZnPc grown on the CuI substrate shows face-on ZnPc peaks.
Thus, detecting molecular orientation with IR-RAS measurements is
viable as the XRD results agree with the orientation states determined
via IR-RAS.

Figure 4 IR-RAS spectra of single-component ZnPc films on (a) PEDOT:PSS/ITO
and (b) CuI/PEDOT:PSS/ITO substrates, and panel (c) shows the calculated
values of the orientation parameter S for four different
film thicknesses.

Our results demonstrate
that IR-RAS can be used to investigate
the molecular orientation in coevaporated ZnPc:C60 BHJ films on PEDOT:PSS
and CuI substrates. However, no useful signal could be detected using
XRD for the coevaporated ZnPc:C60 BHJ film as the crystallinity of
ZnPc was lowered by blending it with C60, and the resultant BHJ film
possesses an amorphous structure. According to the IR-RAS spectra
shown in Figure 5a,b,
the changes in the peak intensities of the out-of-plane and in-plane
vibrations by inserting CuI into a coevaporated ZnPc:C60 BHJ stack
are smaller than those for single-component ZnPc films. The S values for four different film thicknesses (Figure 5c) indicate that the ZnPc molecular
orientation differs slightly from that of a coevaporated ZnPc:C60
BHJ film. However, on the surface of the substrate, the value of S decreased from 0.57 to 0.25 by inserting the CuI film
(thickness of 5 nm) into the layer stack. This clearly shows that
orientation control via π–d interactions was successful
and that the number of face-on ZnPc molecules could be increased,
particularly at the surface of the substrate, even in coevaporated
ZnPc:C60 BHJ films.

Figure 5 IR-RAS spectra of ZnPc:C60 films on (a) PEDOT:PSS/ITO
and (b) CuI/PEDOT:PSS/ITO
substrates. Panel (c) shows the orientation parameter S for four different film thicknesses.

To further investigate the precise control of the molecular
orientation
via π–π interactions between ZnPc molecules at
the interface, coevaporation was performed on a ZnPc/PEDOT:PSS/ITO
layer stack (edge-on ZnPc substrate) and a ZnPc/CuI/PEDOT:PSS/ITO
layer stack (face-on ZnPc substrate). Figure 6a,b shows that the IR-RAS spectral peak of
the out-of-plane bending vibration (730 cm–1) is
larger when inserting a CuI layer, which increases the amount of face-on
ZnPc. The value of S on the surface of the substrate
(CuI thickness of 5 nm) decreased from 0.60 on the edge-on ZnPc substrate
to 0.07 on the face-on ZnPc substrate, as shown in Figure 6c. The single-component ZnPc
film on CuI was highly oriented (S = −0.13)
owing to π–d interactions. The ZnPc molecules in the
coevaporated ZnPc:C60 BHJ film, meanwhile, interacted via π–π
bonds with the face-on ZnPc molecules on the surface of the face-on
ZnPc substrate,28 resulting in a face-on
molecular orientation of ZnPc. Consequently, we compared the strength
of the molecular orientation control via the orientation parameter, S, as shown in Figure 7. The values of S in the single-component
ZnPc films on the PEDOT:PSS and CuI substrates were 0.73 and −0.13,
respectively. Conversely, the values of S in 5 nm-thick
films of coevaporated ZnPc:C60 on PEDOT:PSS, CuI, and the face-on
ZnPc substrates were 0.57, 0.25, and 0.07, respectively. The coevaporated
ZnPc:C60 BHJ film is less influenced by molecular orientation control
than the single-component ZnPc film. However, the ZnPc molecules in
the coevaporated ZnPc:C60 BHJ films are influenced by the molecular
orientation control and are more strongly controlled to the face-on
molecular orientation on the face-on ZnPc substrate than on the CuI
substrate. These results indicate that the π–π
interactions between the ZnPc molecules are stronger than the π–d
interactions between the ZnPc molecules and CuI in the coevaporated
ZnPc:C60 BHJ film. The results also suggest that the thicker the coevaporated
ZnPc:C60 BHJ film is, the weaker the molecular orientation control
is, as demonstrated by comparing the orientation parameter S for each film thickness. The value of S in the single-component ZnPc films is almost constant regardless
of the film thickness. In contrast, the value of S in the coevaporated ZnPc:C60 BHJ film on all substrates increases
as the film thickness increases. The values of S in
5–40 nm-thick BHJ films on the PEDOT:PSS, CuI, and face-on
ZnPc substrates were increased from 0.57 to 0.77, 0.25 to 0.73, and
0.07 to 0.67, respectively. The increase of S mainly
continues until the coevaporated ZnPc:C60 BHJ film thickness is increased
to 20 nm or more, and thereafter the value of S approaches
a constant value as the thickness is increased up to 40 nm. These
results reveal that the ZnPc molecules in coevaporated ZnPc:C60 BHJ
films are randomly oriented or mainly adopt the face-on orientation
in films with thicknesses of 10 nm or lower because of π–d
or π–π interactions; the number of edge-on ZnPc
molecules increases along with film thickness as those interactions
weaken, the thicker the film is (Table 1).

To investigate the correlation between
the ZnPc molecular orientations
and the surface morphologies in coevaporated ZnPc:C60 BHJ films, we
observed the surface morphologies by atomic force microscopy (AFM),
as shown in Figure 8. The AFM image of the surface of the ZnPc:C60 BHJ film on the PEDOT:PSS
substrate shows a smooth surface (Figure 8a), which indicates that no phase separation
occurred during the coevaporation step. The AFM image of the surface
of the ZnPc:C60 BHJ film on the CuI substrate in Figure 8b shows the growth of large
domains on the surface and the increase in the root-mean-square (RMS)
roughness values from 1.39 to 1.69, which indicates that phase separation
of the ZnPc and C60 molecules occurred during the coevaporation step
owing to the π–d interactions at the interfaces between
the CuI substrate and the ZnPc molecules. The strong π–π
interactions between the face-on ZnPc substrate and the ZnPc molecules
and the strong aggregation and phase separation in the ZnPc:C60 BHJ
film on the face-on ZnPc substrate are shown in Figure 8c; the RMS roughness values increased to
3.69, double those for the PEDOT:PSS substrate. Three-dimensional
AFM images of ZnPc films on (a) PEDOT:PSS/ITO and (b) CuI/PEDOT:PSS/ITO
substrates are shown in the Supporting Information in Figure S2. We have already reported the investigation
of the phase separation in ZnPc:C60 BHJ films on CuI and PEDOT:PSS
substrates conducted using cross-sectional energy filtered TEM and
cross-sectional bright field TEM.19 The
most ideal interpenetrating network in a ZnPc:C60 BHJ layer was observed
when using the CuI substrate owing to the strong π–π
interactions between the face-on ZnPc substrate and the ZnPc molecules
in the ZnPc:C60 BHJ layer. The results of previous TEM observations
and our AFM investigation here strongly support our IR-RAS measurement
results that demonstrate that the high S value in
the coevaporated ZnPc:C60 BHJ film on the face-on ZnPc substrate origins
from the signals of face-on ZnPc molecules inside of the aggregated
ZnPc domains in the ideal interpenetrating network.

Figure 8 Three-dimensional atomic
force microscopy (AFM) images of ZnPc:C60
films on (a) PEDOT:PSS/ITO, (b) CuI/PEDOT:PSS/ITO, and (c) ZnPc/CuI/PEDOT:PSS/ITO
substrates.

Herein, we have discussed
the mechanism underpinning the growth
of an ideal interpenetrating donor–acceptor network on a face-on
ZnPc substrate. The initially evaporated ZnPc molecules land on the
face-on ZnPc substrate. The ZnPc molecules are stacked in the face-on
orientation via strong π–π interactions between
the face-on ZnPc substrate and the ZnPc molecules. The stacked ZnPc
molecules easily interact with the second layer of evaporated ZnPc
molecules via strong π–π interactions, which initiates
the creation of the ZnPc aggregated domains. We assumed that the face-on
ZnPc molecules selectively interact with other ZnPc molecules, not
the C60 molecules, owing to strong π–π interactions,
as shown in Figure 9a. The initially evaporated ZnPc layer is also stacked in the face-on
orientation via π–d interactions on the CuI substrate.
ZnPc molecules in the second layer of ZnPc interacted with the initial
ZnPc layer via π–π interactions. However, this
is insufficient for the creation of a nucleation site for ZnPc aggregation
and for the creation of an ideal interpenetrating network, as shown
in Figure 9b. Conversely,
the initially evaporated edge-on oriented ZnPc molecule layer on the
PEDOT:PSS substrate does not interact with the second layer of evaporated
ZnPc molecules. Therefore, ZnPc does not aggregate or phase separate
during coevaporation, as shown in Figure 9c. We also observed a decrease of S in the coevaporated ZnPc:C60 BHJ film during evaporation
via IR-RAS measurements. Initially, the ZnPc aggregate domains on
the surface of the face-on ZnPc substrate display face-on ZnPc molecular
orientation owing to strong π–π interactions. The
deposition of subsequent ZnPc aggregate domains on top of those shows
a reduced degree of face-on molecular orientation owing to weak π–π
interactions because of the increased distance from the substrate
and because of the breakup of the aggregate domain network, which
inhibits the molecular orientation control of the ZnPc molecules.
Finally, we conclude that to create the perfect interpenetrating network
with a face-on molecular orientation, the ZnPc aggregated domains
must be grown as large as possible by controlling the substrate temperature
and evaporation speed.

depending
on the film thickness in coevaporated BHJ films on a (a) face-on ZnPc,
(b) CuI, and (c) PEDOT:PSS substrates.

By performing a versatile technique, namely, IR-RAS measurements,
in situ we were able to precisely investigate the ZnPc molecular orientation
in coevaporated ZnPc:C60 BHJ films. Our results reveal that the ZnPc
molecules in coevaporated ZnPc:C60 BHJ films could be precisely controlled
to adopt the face-on orientation on CuI and ZnPc substrates, whereas
they adopted an edge-on orientation on PEDOT:PSS substrates. In addition,
ZnPc molecules in the ZnPc:C60 films on face-on ZnPc substrates could
be controlled to adopt a more face-on orientation compared to that
on a CuI substrate. These results demonstrate that the π–π
interactions between the ZnPc molecules are stronger than the π–d
interactions between ZnPc molecules and CuI. Our results also suggested
that those interactions could be used to control the molecular orientation
of ZnPc molecules in the first few deposited nanometers in coevaporated
ZnPc:C60 BHJ films. Thicker coevaporated ZnPc:C60 BHJ films showed
weaker molecular orientation control, however.

Experimental Section
ZnPc and C60 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Tokyo, Japan) and
Frontier Carbon Corporation (Tokyo, Japan), respectively, and ZnPc
was further purified three times prior to use. The samples were fabricated
on ITO-patterned glass substrates, which were pretreated by oxygen
plasma for 20 min prior to use. PEDOT:PSS films were spin-coated onto
ITO and annealed at 135 °C for 10 min on a hot plate. Then, CuI
(5 nm) and ZnPc (20 nm) films were evaporated onto the samples. Finally,
a ZnPc:C60 coevaporated film (40 nm) was deposited via vacuum evaporation.
Coevaporation was conducted on a PEDOT:PSS/ITO (PEDOT:PSS substrate),
CuI/PEDOT:PSS/ITO (CuI substrate), and ZnPc/CuI/PEDOT:PSS/ITO (ZnPc
substrate) layer stack to precisely investigate the control of the
molecular orientation by π–d interactions and π–π
interactions. As reference, single-component ZnPc films on PEDOT:PSS
and CuI substrates were also measured. XRD (Rigaku Co.) and atomic
force microscopy (AFM; SPM-9600 apparatus, Shimadzu) were used to
investigate the molecular orientation and morphology, respectively.

The ZnPc molecular orientation was measured in situ via IR-RAS
measurements using an Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) device (FT/IR
6300, JASCO). The FT-IR device was connected to a vacuum chamber with
a pressure of below 2.0 × 10–6 Pa so that measurement
could be performed in situ during the vacuum evaporation. The infrared
light generated by the FT-IR device was p-polarized and reflected
at the substrate surface in a vacuum chamber at a glancing angle of
∼80° to the direction perpendicular to the substrate surface.
All spectra were collected with the FT-IR spectrometer equipped with
a N2-cooled mercury cadmium telluride detector. Each spectrum
is an average of 1024 scans obtained at a resolution of 4 cm–1.
