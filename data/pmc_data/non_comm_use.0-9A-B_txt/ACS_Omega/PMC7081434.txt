There is
an exigency of adopting machine learning techniques to screen and
discover new materials which could address many societal and technological
challenges. In this work, we follow this trend and employ machine
learning to study (high-order) electric properties of organic compounds.
The results of quantum-chemistry calculations of polarizability and
first hyperpolarizability, obtained for more than 50,000 compounds,
served as targets for machine learning-based predictions. The studied
set of molecular structures encompasses organic push–pull molecules
with variable linker lengths. Moreover, the diversified set of linkers,
composed of alternating single/double and single/triple carbon–carbon
bonds, was considered. This study demonstrates that the applied machine
learning strategy allows us to obtain the correlation coefficients,
between predicted and reference values of (hyper)polarizabilities,
exceeding 0.9 on training, validation, and test set. However, in order
to achieve such satisfactory predictive power, one needs to choose
the training set appropriately, as the machine learning methods are
very sensitive to the linker-type diversity in the training set, yielding
catastrophic predictions in certain cases. Furthermore, the dependence
of (hyper)polarizability on the length of spacers was studied in detail,
allowing for explanation of the appreciably high accuracy of employed
approaches.

1 Introduction
Screening and discovering
of new materials
have been playing a crucial role in the development of various fields,
including physics, chemistry, material technology, biology, and medicine,
to name a few. In vitro high-throughput systems and in silico approaches
(e.g., quantum mechanics-based calculations and molecular dynamics)
seem to be incapable of exploring sufficiently the chemical space
of potential candidates because of the huge number of possible compounds.
For example, combinations of up to only 17 atoms (C, N, O, S, and
halogens) could lead to a data set of 166 billion molecules1 which, unfortunately, accounts for a minor portion
of the chemical universe. Characterizing properties of these compounds
could be challenging, time consuming, and requires a vast amount of
resources.

Among various rapidly developing fields, nonlinear
optics (NLO) occupies a privileged spot because of a plethora of technology-related
applications. As demonstrated by developments made during the last
two decades, the bottom-up engineering of materials for NLO applications
is a powerful and effective strategy.2−7 Electric susceptibility tensors
(χ) describe the strengths of light–matter interactions
at a macroscopic level, while at the molecular scale, linear and nonlinear
optical properties are governed by the electric dipole polarizability
(α) and first (β) and second (γ) hyperpolarizabilities.8 Pinpointing factors that determine the magnitudes
of the (hyper)polarizabilities are essential to model new molecules
and host–guest complexes characterized by large nonlinear optical
responses, which are required for optoelectronic and photonic applications.
Quantum-chemistry tools, from a historical perspective, contributed
significantly to the establishment of structure–property relationships,
both for nonresonant and resonant nonlinear optical processes.9−26 As
the complexity of the systems studied using sophisticated experimental
techniques increased in the last decade, this has stimulated the efforts
of theoreticians to develop computational protocols capable of treating
molecular properties at nanoscale.27−32 In particular, there are very
successful attempts to describe (non)linear optical properties in
complex systems (e.g., heterogeneous environments) using quantum mechanics/molecular
mechanics methods (QM/MM).28−32 One
of the approaches that could be potentially employed to study the
nonlinear properties of molecules and their aggregates, thus allowing
for exploring larger chemical space, is machine learning (ML).

The ML approach comprises a collection of prediction, clustering,
and optimization methods which can capture the complex inter-relationships
among variables to yield high performance models. Once trained, a
ML model can rapidly screen desired molecular properties, and this
is the rationale behind its increasing popularity in the field of
computational chemistry.33,34 Many studies have employed
ML in molecular modeling, especially in material technology35 and pharmaceutical science.36,37 However,
the number of studies applying ML to predict NLO properties is scarce.38−42 These attempts were either conducted using
computational methods on small data sets,38−40 which reduced the confidence in the final
results, or exhibited low predictive power.43 It is fair to mention that low-order electric properties (e.g.,
dipole moment and polarizability) were studied much more extensively.42,44−46

Multivariate linear regression was commonly used to construct a quantitative
structure–property relation (QSPR) model for predicting NLO
responses of materials,38,39,43 but the assumption of linearity is not always satisfied in practice.
Alternatively, the neural network, which is an appropriate approach
for analysis of data with a nonlinear structure, was utilized to predict
the hyperpolarizability of alkalides.40 In that work, the authors made a successful attempt to predict high-order
electric properties at a higher level (MP2) based on the properties
computed at the lower level (HF).

The concept of the neural
network was inspired by the structure of the human brain in that a
neural network contains several hidden layers of connected hidden
nodes representing for neural cells. According to the universal approximation
theory,47,48 neural networks can precisely fit continuous
functions as it is considered to be able to capture the complexity
and the interrelation of predictors as well as predictor–target
correlation. Besides neural network, random forest is one of the well-known
ML algorithms which are applicable for regression tasks.49 Random forest is a robust method to outliers
and is considered a correction of decision/regression tree which is
a weak learner constructed by a set of if-then-else rules. The method
was used to predict physical properties of polymers,35 partial charges derived from quantum calculation,50 and electronic ground-state properties of organic
molecules.50

The present study aims
at contributing to these efforts and is devoted to the application
of ML to predict molecular (hyper)polarizabilities of organic compounds
by exploiting a neural network and random forest combined with three
different fingerprints/descriptors.

2 Theory
and Computational Details
In the presence
of an external electric field F, the a’th Cartesian component of the total molecular dipole moment,
μa, may be expressed as a Taylor
series which takes the form51 1  where μa0 is the a’th component
of the permanent dipole moment; αab(−ωσ; ω1), βabc(−ωσ; ω1, ω2) and γabcd(−ωσ; ω1, ω2, ω3) are components of the linear polarizability,
first hyperpolarizability, and second hyperpolarizability, respectively;
ωσ is the sum of the external field frequencies
ωi, and K(2) and K(3) are factors required for all
hyperpolarizabilities of the same order to have the same static limit.
The static polarizability (α(0; 0)) and first hyperpolarizability
(β(0; 0, 0)) are central to this study. Orientationally averaged
polarizability and first hyperpolarizability were calculated according
to the following formulae 2   3  where αij and βijk are tensor components
in the Cartesian coordinate system. For the sake of brevity, the fields
will be omitted and the symbols α and β will be used instead
to denote rotationally-averaged static properties.

High-throughput
generation of chemical compounds was performed using an in-house computer
code written in PYTHON programming language. Chemical structures and
fragments were drawn using CS ChemDraw Ultra software. Quantum-chemical
calculations were performed using Gaussian 09 program,52 and preoptimization was done with the aid of
OpenBabel53 program with MMFF94s force
field. Logarithmic log10 scale was used to improve the
performance of ML methods and to ease further analysis. In this study,
we used two hidden-layer neural networks54 and the random forest55 algorithms. Feature
extraction was done by PaDEL program.56 R and Matlab programming languages were employed for the data analysis.
Briefly, regression by the neural network and random forest was performed
using Matlab Statistic and ML toolbox and Neural Network toolbox,
respectively. Data visualization, including principal component analysis
(PCA), and scatter plot were exploited using “vegan”57 and “ggplot2”58 R package. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the ML
models, correlation coefficient of predicted values and actual values
of (hyper)polarizabilities (α and β) was computed as 4  where Ypredicted is the predicted value, Yactual is the
actual value of (hyper)polarizability, E(·)
is statistical expectation, μ is mean, and σ is standard
deviation.

3 Results and
Discussion
In order to study the performance of the ML approach
in predicting the electric properties of molecules, we generated more
than 50,000 molecular geometries by combining chemical fragments depicted
in Figure 1. The choice
of these one-dimensional (1D) donor–acceptor (D–A) systems
stems from their popularity in the field of molecular NLO. For example,
in late 70s of past century, Oudar and Chemla proposed a two-level
model which predicted that push–pull systems are good candidates
for second-order NLO.9 Since then, these
systems have been extensively studied both on theoretical and experimental
basis.11−13,17,18,23,59−69 It should be
highlighted that some of the structures studied in this work, that
is, with short linkers, were synthesized, and their nonlinear optical
properties were characterized experimentally.59,70 The
geometries of molecules shown in Figure 1 were preoptimized using molecular mechanics-based
approach and used in subsequent quantum-chemical calculations using
the AM1 method. After elimination of unsuccessful attempts to locate
stationary points on potential energy hypersurfaces, we obtained in
total 51,461 optimal geometries. The geometries fell into 10,656 unique
families, which contained up to five members each. A family was defined
as a group of geometries that share the same structure and only differ
in total length of spacers. For the very same set, we computed polarizability
and first hyperpolarizability. Likewise, the AM1 method was used to
that end. The choice of this method stems from the significant size
of the studied systems, as shown in Figure 2. As it will be shown at the end of this
section, the AM1 Hamiltonian satisfactorily predicts the property
trends for extended π-conjugated systems. The first hyperpolarizability
was transferred into a logarithmic (with base 10) scale to center
the histogram and reduce the skewness of data, which would improve
the predictive performance of ML models (see Figure S1 in Supporting Information). The outputs from quantum-chemical
calculations were further postprocessed by PaDEL program for features
extraction, including Pubchem and Klekota–Roth71 fingerprints (hereafter abbreviated as Klekota), and 1D/2D
descriptors. Single-value features were removed from further analysis,
resulting in 272 features of Pubchem fingerprint, 296 features of
Klekota fingerprint, and 1098 features of 1D/2D descriptors. Finally,
the preprocessed features served as inputs for ML methods to predict
α and β. The whole data set was randomly divided into
training, validation, and test set with a ratio of 50:25:25, respectively.
The results of these analyses are gathered in Table 1 (polarizability, α) and Table 2 (first hyperpolarizability,
β).

 	Pubchem	0.95	0.93	0.93	
 	Klekota	0.98	0.97	0.97	
By and large, the performances of random forest and
the neural network in predicting polarizability are similar regardless
of the feature sets. Klekota fingerprint and 1D/2D descriptors yielded
the highest correlation coefficient on the test set equal to 0.99.
The combination of ML methods and Pubchem fingerprint resulted in
rather a low value of the correlation coefficient (0.82). In the case
of hyperpolarizability, the correlation coefficients obtained for
ML methods and fingerprint/descriptors exceed 0.92 (see Table 2). A much higher value, that
is, as large as 0.97, can be obtained employing either random forest
or neural network methods coupled with 1D/2D descriptors or Klekota
fingerprint. Pubchem fingerprint yields the lowest accuracy regardless
of the ML method employed.

Aiming at the testing of the performance
of ML methods applied to new types of data, we generated three groups
of compounds from a subset of the studied systems, which is shown
in Figure 3. Each group
was composed of molecules with spacers containing single, alternating
single/double, or single/triple carbon–carbon bonds. First
hyperpolarizability was obtained, as above, using the AM1 method.
The final sets included 1,907, 2,142, and 1,789 compounds with spacers
containing single, double, and triple carbon–carbon bonds,
respectively. A neural network with Klekota fingerprint was trained
based on the training set for compounds with particular spacer type
and subsequently tested based on the test sets for all three groups
of molecules (i.e., with three different spacer types). The analysis
of the results leads to an interesting observation. For example, as
expected based on the conclusions drawn in the preceding paragraphs,
the correlation coefficient is high, provided the training and the
test sets were composed of the molecules from the very same group.
In such case, the corresponding values are in the range 0.98–0.99
(see Table 3). In contrast,
the neural network trained on one particular group (i.e., containing
molecules with specific type of spacer) cannot accurately predict
hyperpolarizability for the members of the other groups. In qualitative
sense, this result falls into expectation, but the corresponding small
values of correlation coefficient are quite striking. The only exception
is found for a neural network trained on the set of compounds with
linkers containing double carbon–carbon bonds. In that event,
one finds an average correlation of 0.46 for the test set encompassing
molecules with linkers composed of alternating single/triple carbon–carbon
bonds. For the rest of the cases, the neural network showed correlation
coefficient values not exceeding 0.25. In order to investigate the
poor performance of the neural network in these cases, PCA were utilized
on data extracted from the three groups of geometries (Klekota–Roth
fingerprints were used), and the results are shown in Figure S2 (see Supporting Information). We found that compounds
containing single bonds segregated from compounds containing alternating
single/π-conjugated carbon–carbon bonds, which suggested
a high degree of dissimilarity in data patterns between the two groups.
Presumably, this explains why neural networks trained on a single-bond
group failed to predict hyperpolarizability on a π-conjugated-bond
group and vice versa. Compounds containing alternating single/triple
carbon–carbon bonds fall into the transition region of the
two groups, which is a likely explanation that testing performance
on the triple-bond group was higher than that of the rest.

In
order to shed light on the relationship between (hyper)polarizability
and the total spacer length (n), we prepared a scatter
plot for a subset of molecules with spacers containing either single
or alternating single/double bonds, and the results are shown in Figure 4. In general, the
(hyper)polarizability of compounds with linkers containing alternating
single/double carbon–carbon bonds is significantly higher than
those for molecules presenting linkers with single bonds only. There
is a substantial qualitative difference in the pattern of polarizability
and hyperpolarizability. While polarizability is linearly dependent
on the length of spacers (see Figure 4A,C), the relation between hyperpolarizability and
the spacer length is nonlinear (Figure 4B,D). We observed a trend of saturation on hyperpolarizability
(log10 scale), and we modeled this behavior using the following
equation 5  where n is the length of spacers. We used nonlinear least squares regression
to fit the eq 5 to data
points and to determine the βmax coefficient. Families
with less than four compounds and with correlation coefficient less
than 0.9 were eliminated, resulting in 23,591 π-conjugated compounds
with corresponding estimated βmax. Random forest
and neural networks were employed with Pubchem fingerprint, Klekota
fingerprint, and 1D/2D descriptor to predict the estimated βmax coefficient. The results are shown in Table 4. Generally, the proposed methods
could accurately predict βmax coefficient of different
families of compounds with correlation of at least 0.88, regardless
of the spacer length. Neural network overperformed random forest,
except the combination with 1D/2D descriptors, and exhibited the highest
correlation of 0.94 (Klekota). Regarding the random forest method,
the three fingerprint/descriptors showed almost equivalent correlation.
To investigate structures of data generated by Klekota fingerprint,
we used PCA to project the data into a two-dimensional (2D) space
by selecting two principal components corresponding to the highest
eigenvalues (Figure 5). The variation of the data was 98% explained by the principal components,
which indicated the confidence of PCA plot for further analysis. It
was obvious that the data were segregated into two separate clusters
composed of molecules with alternating single/double (denoted as π-conjugated)
and single carbon–carbon bonds (Figure 5B). Among each cluster, data tended to cluster
based on the spacer length (Figure 5A) and polarizability (Figure 5C), while the segregation by hyperpolarizability
remained uncertain (Figure 5D).

In order to safeguard the conclusions drawn based
on the AM1 results, we have performed more advanced electronic-structure
calculations using density functional theory. To this end, we used
CAM-B3LYP functional which was proved to be reliable in the case of
nonlinear optical properties of π-conjugated systems.72,73 Property trends were calculated at AM1 and CAM-B3LYP/cc-pVDZ levels
of theory for the family shown in Figure 3 with single/double bond linker and COCF3 and NMe2 substituents. The cc-pVDZ basis set was
used to avoid linear-dependency issues during property calculations
for the largest molecules. It is well known that diffuse functions
are needed to accurately predict high-order electric properties of
molecules. However, earlier studies demonstrate that the polarized
basis sets are sufficient to reproduce property trends (α and
β) for donor−π–acceptor molecules. The comparison
is presented in Figure 6 and demonstrates that there is satisfactory trend reproduction in
the case of the AM1 method. It holds both for polarizability and first
hyperpolarizability. Finally, it should not be overlooked that the
recent study of Lu et al. on predictions of first hyperpolarizability
of solvated donor−π–acceptor molecules demonstrates
very good correlations between calculated and experimental trends
in the case of range-separated functionals.74

4 Summary and Conclusions
In the present work,
the ML was utilized to predict high-order
electric properties of donor–acceptor-substituted organic compounds.
To this end, we studied polarizability and hyperpolarizability of
more than 50,000 compounds using quantum-chemistry methods and ML
approaches. As far as the latter property is concerned, this is the
first investigation for such large and diverse set of compounds. Large-scale
data analysis contributed to the much higher confidence and accuracy
of the results presented herein, in comparison with previous attempts.38−40,43 Particularly,
random forest and neural networks, two of the most appreciated ML
methods for regression, were able to capture the correlation between
three fingerprints/descriptors and α and β computed using
quantum tools, and yielded QSPR models with considerable accuracy.
Additionally, we found that the high quantity of data was sufficient
but not enough to train high-performance ML predictors. A high degree
of data diversity is also a key ingredient, complementing to data
quantity, in application of ML in predicting high-order electrical
properties. The hyperpolarizability dependence on the spacer length
was also investigated, and it can be concluded that the ML approaches
can reliably capture the trends for different families of compounds
with correlation of at least 0.88, regardless of the spacer length.
With an appropriate data set, that is, covering wide palette of linker/conjugation
patterns, the proposed methods could be presumably extended to predict
other nonlinear optical properties for the purpose of fast and efficient
material screening and design.
