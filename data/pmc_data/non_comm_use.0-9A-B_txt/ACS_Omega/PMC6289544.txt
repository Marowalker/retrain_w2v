The ability to bind
strongly to complementary nucleic acid sequences,
invade complex nucleic acid structures, and resist degradation by
cellular enzymes has made peptide nucleic acid (PNA) oligomers as
very useful hybridization probes in molecular diagnosis. For such
applications, the PNA oligomers have to be labeled with appropriate
reporters as they lack intrinsic labels that can be used in biophysical
assays. Although solid-phase synthesis is commonly used to attach
reporters onto PNA, development of milder and modular labeling methods
will provide access to PNA oligomers labeled with a wider range of
biophysical tags. Here, we describe the establishment of a postsynthetic
modification strategy based on bioorthogonal chemical reactions in
functionalizing PNA oligomers in solution with a variety of tags.
A toolbox composed of alkyne- and azide-modified monomers were site-specifically
incorporated into PNA oligomers and postsynthetically click-functionalized
with various tags, ranging from sugar, amino acid, biotin, to fluorophores,
by using copper(I)-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition, strain-promoted
azide–alkyne cycloaddition, and Staudinger ligation reactions.
As a proof of utility of this method, fluorescent PNA hybridization
probes were developed and used in imaging human telomeres in chromosomes
and poly(A) RNAs in cells. Taken together, this simple approach of
generating a wide range of functional PNA oligomers will expand the
use of PNA in molecular diagnosis.

Introduction
The potential of peptide
nucleic acid (PNA) in gene therapy has
long been contemplated because of its resistance to cellular hydrolytic
enzymes and ability to bind strongly to complementary DNA and RNA.1−6 In addition, the tendency to stabilize triple helix7,8 and invade complex secondary structures9−11 has rendered
PNA oligomers as very useful hybridization probes in molecular diagnosis.
Needless to say, such applications greatly rely on PNA oligomers labeled
with an appropriate reporter like a fluorophore, affinity tag, or
magnetic resonance imaging agent.12−16 In particular, PNAs conjugated to fluorescent reporters
have been frequently utilized in various hybridization assays for
the detection, quantification, and visualization of specific nucleic
acid sequences in cell-free and native cellular conditions.17−25

Probe-labeled PNA oligomers are commonly synthesized by using
a
procedure analogous to the solid-phase peptide synthesis protocol.
Typically, native nucleobases attached to N-(2-aminoethyl)glycine
(aeg) or a similar backbone are sequentially added from the C terminus
(3′-end) to N terminus (5′-end) on the solid support
by using tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) or fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl
chloride (Fmoc) chemistry.1,26 The desired label is
then introduced at the N terminus by performing an acid–amine
coupling reaction on the solid support before the final cleavage cum
global deprotection step.12,13,27 This approach has been commonly used in preparing fluorescently
modified PNA probes for imaging specific nucleic acid sequences in
cells. Alternatively, base-modified monomers are incorporated into
PNA oligomers at the desired position during solid-phase synthesis.28−33 However, this on-column labeling method has certain shortcomings.
The tendency of many activated esters to undergo hydrolysis reduces
the coupling efficiency, and certain modifications do not survive
strong acid conditions used in the cleavage step (e.g., trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA)/trifluoromethanesulfonic acid). Similar problems have also
been encountered in both solid-phase peptide and oligonucleotide (ON)
labeling methods. To circumvent these drawbacks, postsynthetic modification
using chemoselective reactions has emerged as a valuable route to
label glycans, proteins, and nucleic acids.34−44 In this approach, a small reactive handle, which is compatible with
solid-phase or enzymatic labeling methods, is introduced into the
oligomer and the desired label is attached by performing a chemoselective
reaction between the reactive handle on the oligomer and the label
containing the cognate reactive partner. This so-called “click
chemistry” can be performed on the solid support as well as
on the free oligomer in solution.45

Several chemoselective reactions, including copper(I)-catalyzed
azide–alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), strain-promoted azide–alkyne
cycloaddition (SPAAC), thiol–ene coupling, azide–phosphine
Staudinger ligation, inverse electron demand Diels–Alder, and
palladium-catalyzed reactions have been described for labeling biomolecules.34−44 In particular, azide–alkyne cycloaddition reaction has gained
prominence as it is fast, highly chemoselective, and bioorthogonal,
which has enabled its use in cell-free as well as in cellular systems.
Initially, this bioconjugation method was performed on a solid support
to prepare labeled PNA oligomers.22,46−50 Subsequently, solution-phase click labeling was conceived, wherein
PNAs conjugated to cell-penetrating peptides, mesoporous silica nanoparticles,
cross-linking agents, and fluorophores were prepared.51−56 However, given the usefulness of PNA in molecular diagnosis, establishment
of chemical labeling strategies, which will provide direct access
to a repertoire of PNA probes in a modular fashion, is constantly
needed.

Here, we describe the synthesis and site-specific incorporation
of a clickable toolbox composed of alkyne- and azide-modified uracil
PNA base analogs and azidoacetic acid as an azide surrogate. The alkyne-
and azide-modified PNA oligomers were efficiently clicked with a variety
of tags, ranging from sugar, amino acid, biotin, to fluorophores,
by CuAAC reaction. The ability of azide group to participate in different
chemoselective reactions was further exploited in labeling PNA with
biophysical probes in a modular fashion by using SPAAC and Staudinger
ligation reactions. Using this labeling method, we designed fluorescent
PNA hybridization probes to specifically visualize human telomeres
in chromosomes and poly(A) tail-containing RNAs in cells. Further,
the compatibility of clickable PNA oligomers to posthybridization
labeling adds an advantage to this method as oligomers containing
large reporters could potentially hamper the hybridization efficiency.

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis of Alkyne- and Azide-Modified Uracil
PNA Base Analogs 7 and 14
The clickable
uracil PNA base
analogs containing the original aeg backbone were synthesized according
to the steps illustrated in Schemes 1 and 2. In the monomer design, we have intentionally tethered the clickable
component to the nucleobase via an alkyl or triethylene glycol linker
so as to enhance the efficiency of the click reaction when incorporated
into PNA oligomers. Further, the PNA analogs 7 and 14 contain a nonclickable internal alkyne, which can be used
as a Raman-scattering label.57 The alkyne
group displays a characteristic strong signal, which falls in the
Raman-silent region of the cell.58 This
unique bioorthogonal Raman label has recently been used in visualizing
biomolecules, including nucleic acids and proteins, by the stimulated
Raman-scattering imaging technique.59−61 Hence, these nucleobase
analogs incorporated into PNA hybridization probes could potentially
facilitate two-channel visualization of a specific nucleic acid sequence
in cells by employing click chemistry (terminal alkyne or azide) and
Raman spectroscopy (internal alkyne).

PNA Monomer 7
Scheme 2 Synthesis of Azide-Labeled Uracil PNA Monomer 14
Azidoacetic acid 15 was used for introducing azide group at the N terminus of PNA.

5-Iodouracil ethyl ester 1(62) was reacted with octa-1,7-diyne 2 under Sonogashira
coupling reaction conditions to give octadiyne-conjugated uracil (ODU)
ethyl ester 3 (Scheme 1). The ester group was hydrolyzed in the presence of
LiOH and coupled with a commercially available Fmoc aeg–PNA
backbone 5 to give compound 6. Further treatment
with TFA gave the ODU-modified PNA monomer 7 required
for the solid-phase PNA synthesis.

5-Iodouracil ethyl ester 1 was Boc-protected (8) at the N3 position.32O-Tosylated tetraethylene glycol
containing a terminal alkyne
group (9) was prepared in two steps following a reported
procedure.63 Compound 8 was
coupled with 9 under Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction
conditions, which was then converted into azide-modified uracil ester 11 by treating with NaN3 (Scheme 2). The ester was hydrolyzed and coupled with
Fmoc aeg–PNA backbone 5, and then the tertiary
butyl group was removed using TFA to afford the azide-modified uracil
PNA building block 14.

Postsynthetic Modification
of Alkyne- and Azide-Labeled PNA
Oligomers
The suitability of modified PNA base analogs for
postsynthetic chemical labeling was evaluated by using model PNA oligomers
containing OD–uracil (16), azido–uracil
(17), and azido–acetamide (18, Figure 1). These oligomers
were prepared using lysine-loaded Rink amide resin and Fmoc-protected
aeg–PNA monomers. PNA oligomers were synthesized with two C-terminal
lysine residues to enhance the aqueous solubility. The oligomers were
further purified by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography
(RP-HPLC) and characterized by mass analysis (Figure S1 and Table S1). The modified PNAs were subjected
to CuAAC, SPAAC, and Staudinger ligation reactions in the presence
of a variety of substrates containing cognate alkyne, azide, and phosphine
reactive partners (a–i, Figure 2). The substrates
included different fluorophores, sugar, amino acid, and affinity tags.

of substrates and commercial source.

CuAAC reaction was performed by incubating alkyne-modified
PNA 16 and azide-modified PNA 17 and 18 with azide substrates a–d and alkyne
substrates e–g, respectively (Figures 2, 3, and 4). Reactions were carried out
in the presence of a water-soluble Cu(I) stabilizing ligand, tris(3-hydroxypropyltriazolylmethyl)amine
(THPTA), CuSO4, and a reducing agent, sodium ascorbate,
at 37 °C for 2 h. The reaction mixture was resolved by RP-HPLC,
and the clicked product was isolated and characterized by matrix assisted
laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass analysis
(Figures S2, S3, and Table S2). In a reaction
with different azide substrates (a–d), the alkyne-modified PNA 16 was completely consumed
within 2 h and respective clicked products were isolated in respectable
yields (Table S2). Typically, a reaction
performed at 15 nmol scale of PNA 16 gave 5.8–7.8
nmol of the product (16a–16d). CuAAC
reaction between azide-modified PNA 17 and 18 with alkyne substrates e–g proceeded
to completion, and the products were isolated in moderate yields (Figure 4 and Table S2). The emission spectrum of naphthalimide-labeled
PNA products (16a, 17e and 18e) also confirmed the fluorescence labeling by click reaction (Figure S4). Next, PNAs 17 and 18 were subjected to SPAAC reaction with biotin–cyclooctyne
(h). The reaction completed in 1 h, and the clicked products 17h and 18h were recovered in good yields (Figure 5 and Table S3). Although Staudinger ligation between
azido–uracil-modified PNA 17 and biotinylated
triarylphosphine (i) was poor, reaction with azido–acetamide-modified
PNA 18 gave good yields of the ligated product 18i (Table S3). Collectively, these
results underscore the potential of the click-labeling approach in
synthesizing various functionalized PNA oligomers in amounts sufficient
for subsequent biophysical analysis.

Clicked-Labeled PNA Hybridization
Probes Allow Visualization
of Specific Nucleic Acid Sequences
Imaging Human Telomeric
DNA Repeat Sequence
To illustrate
the utility of this postsynthetic labeling method in visualizing nucleic
acids, we first chose to target the human telomeres, which are present
at the ends of chromosomes and protect them from end-to-end fusion
and degradation.64,65 The human telomeres are composed
of thousands of tandem hexameric nucleotide repeat (TTAGGG)n, which terminate into 100–200 nucleotide
long 3′ single-stranded overhang.66 Abnormal shortening of telomeric repeats and maintenance of telomere
length by the telomerase activity can lead to genomic instability
and tumor progression.67−69 Telomeric DNA repeat overhang has been shown to form
G-quadruplex structures in vitro and in cellular environment.70−75 Recently, we developed a graphene oxide-based platform to detect
telomeric DNA repeat in vitro by using the ability of a complementary
PNA probe to invade G-quadruplex structure and form a stable duplex.76 Prompted by this key observation, we sought
to use the postsynthetic labeling approach to develop a fluorescently
labeled PNA hybridization probe to visualize telomeres on the chromosome
ends.

An 18-mer azide-labeled PNA probe 19 complementary
to the human telomeric DNA repeat sequence (TTAGGG)n was synthesized (Figure 1 and Table S1). When subjected
to CuAAC, SPAAC, and Staudinger ligation reactions with fluorescent
and biotin substrates, we could isolate the clicked products in reasonable
amounts (Figure 2 and Table S4). Although biotin-labeled PNA probes
(19h and 19i) could be used for immunofluorescence
staining, Alexa594-labeled PNA probe (19j) can be directly
visualized post hybridization with telomeric DNA.

DLD-1 cells
in culture were treated with colcemid to arrest the
cell cycle in the metaphase stage.77 The
cell suspension was incubated in a hypotonic solution (75 mM KCl),
and the pelleted cells were resuspended in a fixative solution. The
cells were then dropped on a glass slide to prepare the metaphase
chromosome spreads. Chromosomes were hybridized with freshly click-labeled
Alexa PNA probe 19j and counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI). Images of the spread clearly indicated four fluorescent spots
(red) consistent with the binding of the PNA probe to the telomeres
present at the ends of chromosomes (Figure 6A).77,78 A commercially available
FITC-labeled PNA probe prepared by acid–amine coupling also
showed similar telomere staining pattern (green, Figure 6B). Notably, both the probes
stained all chromosomes in a given spread, highlighting the comparable
efficiency of the staining process by click-labeled and commercial
PNA probes.

PNA probe 19j (red staining at the ends of chromosomes)
and (B) FITC-labeled PNA probe (green staining at the ends of chromosomes).
Metaphase spreads were prepared using DLD-1 cells and subjected to
hybridization with PNA probes (300 nM) in a hybridization buffer.
For details see Methods section.

Imaging Poly(A) RNAs
With the success
of imaging telomeric
DNA, we expanded the utility of click PNA labeling approach by developing
a fluorescent poly(T) PNA probe to visualize cellular poly(A) RNAs.
Poly(A) tailing is an important mRNA maturation process, which provides
stability and promotes translation of mRNA.79,80 Poly(A) tail length shortening causes mRNA splicing and initiates
degradation process. Fluorescent poly(T) ON probes are commonly used
to track and visualize poly(A) RNAs inside cells,81−84 although the stability and hybridization
efficiency of ON probes in a cellular environment is a concern. Since
PNA oligomers are resistant to nucleases and proteases and they bind
more strongly to RNA than the complementary DNA ON, we synthesized
a 12-mer fluorescent poly(T) PNA probe by click-reacting alkyne-modified
PNA 20 with Alexa594 azide (k, red, Figure 2 and Table S4).

DLD-1 cells in culture were
fixed, permeabilized, and hybridized with PNA 20k in
a hybridization buffer at 37 °C for 2.5 h. Cells were washed
and then DAPI-stained and imaged using a confocal microscope. The
images revealed a punctate nuclear staining and uniform cytoplasmic
staining in the Alexa594 channel (red, Figure 7A). As a positive control, cells were incubated
with Cy5-(dT)30, a commonly used DNA ON probe for poly(A)
RNA imaging.82,83 The DNA probe produced a staining
pattern similar to that of the PNA probe (Figure 7B). The binding of PNA–DNA probes
to poly(A) RNAs was further confirmed by RNase A treatment.85 Cells treated with RNase A and then hybridized
with the probes revealed no detectable fluorescence signal from the
cells (Figure 7).

Figure 7 (A) Fluorescent
PNA probe 20k (red) efficiently stains
cellular poly(A) RNAs. RNase A treatment almost completely abolished
poly(A) RNA staining by the PNA probe. (B) Similar staining pattern
and loss of signal upon RNase A treatment was also observed when cells
were hybridized with Cy5-(dT)30, a commonly used probe
for poly(A) RNA imaging.

Posthybridization Click Labeling of PNA–DNA ON Duplex
Although PNA binds to its target ON strongly, certain bulky modifications
could potentially affect its binding efficiency. Hence, we attempted
to perform click reactions on PNA–DNA heteroduplexes. Azide-modified
(19) and alkyne-modified (21) PNAs were
hybridized with a complementary telomeric DNA ON repeat 23. Azide-labeled duplex 19·23 was reacted
with Alexa alkyne (j), Cy5 cyclooctyne (l), and triarylphosphine biotin (i), and the products
were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) under nondenaturing
conditions. UV shadowing at 260 nm revealed almost complete labeling
of the heteroduplex by CuAAC, SPAAC, and Staudinger ligation reactions
(Figure 8, lanes 2–4).
Further, UV shadowing at 365 nm revealed the fluorescence labeling
by Alexa and Cy5 alkynes by click reaction (lanes 2 and 3). Similarly,
alkyne-labeled PNA–DNA duplex 21·23 reacted quite efficiently with Alexa azide substrate k (lane 6). A control reaction between unmodified PNA–DNA duplex
(22·23) and Alexa azide k did not produce any fluorescent click product, substantiating the
high chemoselectivity of this labeling method. It is important to
mention here that the observed mobility of click-labeled duplexes
relative to the substrate duplexes is due to a combined effect of
increased molecular weight and overall charge on the products.

Conclusions
We
have established a postsynthetic chemical functionalization
method to generate PNA probes by using bioorthogonal reactions like
azide–alkyne cycloaddition and Staudinger ligation reactions.
The clickable PNA oligomers, generated by incorporating azide- and
alkyne-modified PNA base analogs, were used in installing a repertoire
of biophysical tags in a modular fashion by click reactions. This
labeling method was further utilized in synthesizing fluorescent PNA
hybridization probes complementary to the human telomeric DNA ON repeat
and poly(A) repeat, which enabled the specific visualization of human
telomeres in chromosomes and poly(A) tail-containing RNAs in cells.
Collectively, our results demonstrate that this PNA bioconjugation
approach is modular and will complement existing methods by providing
access to PNA probes for various applications.

serum (Gibco by Life Technologies, 10437028) and penicillin–streptomycin
(Gibco by Life Technologies, 15070-063) under humidified atmosphere
at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were seeded in a 100 mm
culture dish and allowed to grow till 70% confluency, and then cells
were further treated with Colcemid (Roche 10295892001) 0.1 μg/mL
for 90 min in an incubator. Subsequently, cells were trypsinized to
form a single-cell suspension and incubated in a hypotonic solution
(75 mM KCl). Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended
in fixative solution (methanol/acetic acid = 3:1). Metaphase spreads
were prepared by dropping the cell suspension (10 μL) in fixative
on a glass slide under moist condition. Glass slides with spreads
were then air-dried and stored at room temperature until use.

Slides containing metaphase
spreads were heated at 65 °C for 10 min and immersed in 1×
PBS for 15 min. Subsequently, metaphase spreads were fixed using 4%
formaldehyde in 1× PBS (50 mM MgCl2) for 15 min. Slides
were then washed with 1× PBS for 5 min twice and treated with
3 μg/μL RNase A for 3 h in a moist condition at 37 °C.
After RNase treatment, slides were washed with 2× saline-sodium

Alexa594-labeled PNA probe 19j or FITC-labeled Pangene
PNA probe (300 nM) in the hybridization buffer [70% formamide, 20
mM Tris (pH 7.4), 20 mM Na2HPO4 (pH 7.4), and
0.1 μg/mL salmon sperm DNA in 2× SSC buffer] at 85 °C
for 6 min. The above slides were then incubated for 12 h at 37 °C
in a moist condition.

After hybridization, slides were washed
with wash buffer I (70% formamide and 10 mM Tris pH 7.2) twice for
15 min and then with wash buffer II (70% formamide, 50 mM Tris pH
7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.05% Tween20) twice for 10 min. Slides were
then dehydrated with ethanol series as mentioned earlier and air-dried.
Metaphase spreads were counterstained with DAPI in 2× SSC for
3 min and washed with 0.1× SSC. Further, 7 μL of antifade
mounting media was added to the spreads on the slide, covered with
coverslips, and sealed with nail polish. Cells were imaged using Zeiss
Axio Imager Z1 with oil immersion using 100× lens.

and penicillin–streptomycin (Gibco by Life Technologies, 15070-063)
under humidified atmosphere at 37 °C with 5% CO2.
Cells (0.1–0.3 million) were seeded on coverslips placed in
a 12-well plate. The cells were allowed to grow for nearly 48 h before
hybridization experiment.

Fluorescence Hybridization Assay
Cells grown on coverslips
were washed with 500 μL of 1× PBS (10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4, 2.7 mM KCl,
137 mM NaCl, 500 μM vanadylribonucleoside complex (VRC), pH
7.4) and fixed in 500 μL of 4% paraformaldehyde containing 500
μM VRC for 15 min. Subsequently, cells were permeabilized with
95% chilled methanol for 5 min. Cells were then washed with 500 μL
of 2× SSC buffer (0.3 M sodium citrate, 0.03 M sodium chloride,
500 μM VRC, pH 7.4). The coverslip was placed upside down on
a Parafilm strip containing 50 μL of hybridization buffer (10%
(w/v) dextran sulfate, 40% (v/v) formamide, 30 ng/μL salmon

for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed with 500 μL of 2×
SSC buffer and hybridized with the fluorescent PNA probe 20k (1.0 μM) in hybridization buffer for 2.5 h at 37 °C.
In a positive control experiment, cells were hybridized with 0.5 μM
Cy5-(dT)30 under similar conditions. Cells were then washed
with 500 μL of 2× SSC and 500 μL of 0.1× SSC
buffer. Cells were counterstained with 500 μL of DAPI (55 nM
in 2× SSC) for 3 min and washed with 500 μL of 0.1×
SSC. Coverslips were then placed on a microscope slide with 7 μL
of antifade mounting media and sealed with nail polish. Cells were
imaged using a confocal laser scanning microscope with oil immersion
using 40× lens. Images were acquired by using the following excitation
and emission settings. DAPI (λex = 405 nm and λem = 420–480 nm, blue channel); Alexa594-modified PNA
probe (λex = 561 nm and λem = 570–680
nm, red channel); and Cy5-(dT)30 probe (λex = 633 nm and λem = 640–760 nm, red channel).
Java ImageJ software was used to process the images.

RNase A Treatment
Cells were incubated in 500 μL
of RNase A (0.5 μg/mL in 1× PBS) solution for 1 h at 37
°C. Cells were washed with 500 μL of 2× SSC and then
hybridized with 0.5 μM of Cy5-(dT)30 or 1.0 μM
of labeled PNA probe 20k, as mentioned above.
