Transcutaneous antigen
administration provides an alternative to
invasive syringe injections. The objective of this study was to investigate
the feasibility of fabrication and antigen delivery using microneedles
made from corn protein, zein. Micromolding technique was used to cast
cone-shaped zein microneedles (ZMNs). The insertion of ZMNs and the
delivery of the model antigen, ovalbumin (OVA), into the skin was
confirmed by histological examination and confocal microscopy. In
addition, a significantly (p < 0.05) lower bacterial
skin penetration was observed after ZMN application compared with
hypodermic syringe application. OVA coated on ZMNs was stable after
storage under ambient and refrigerator conditions. Transcutaneous
immunization studies showed significantly (p <
0.001) greater antibody titers (total IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a) after
the application of OVA-coated ZMNs and OVA intradermal injection compared
with the control group. Taken together, antigen-coated ZMNs can be
developed for transcutaneous vaccine delivery.

Introduction
Currently, majority
of the vaccines are administered using hypodermic
needles. The syringe-based injections have been associated with multiple
disadvantages including needle phobia, needle injuries, usage of contaminated
needles, and requirement of a healthcare professional among others.1−3 Recent dramatic improvements in precision engineering have allowed
for the design and fabrication of micron-scale devices that can be
used to deliver vaccines.4 There has been
a tremendous interest in the development of microneedle devices for
transcutaneous therapeutic and vaccine delivery and for cosmetic applications.5,6 This has led to the publication of many research reports and the
commercial approval of few microneedle-based devices.7 The approved devices include Intanza to deliver influenza
vaccine and Dermaroller for cosmetic skin application. Furthermore,
multiple microneedle-based transcutaneous delivery systems are under
various phases of clinical studies.8

The major advantage associated with microneedle-based devices over
hypodermic syringes include minimal invasion inside of the skin membrane,
thereby reducing needle injuries and improving user compliance.9 More recently, it has been understood that multiple
factors influence the utilization of microneedles for transcutaneous
immunization. In addition to the needle size, shape, aspect ratio,
and distance of separation between the needles, the material of construction
has been found to be an important contributor to antigen loading,
skin insertion, antigen release, and stability of the antigen.10 Therefore, the initial microneedles made of
stainless steel, silica, and ceramic gave way to the development of
microneedles made of biocompatible polymeric materials.11 These biocompatible polymeric microneedles are
made of poly-lactide-co-glycolide, poly-l-lysine, carboxymethyl cellulose, sodium alginate, chitosan, polyvinyl
pyrrolidone, and polyvinyl alcohol.12 Most
of these microneedle patches are prepared using a simple micromolding
technique.13,14 However, the clinical development
of polymer-based microneedles has been limited by the mechanical strength
of the needles, antigen stability, and release characteristics.

To this end, here we report the fabrication of a microneedle array
made of zein protein. Gorham in 1821 first described zein after isolating
the protein from maize.15 Since then, numerous
research papers have been published and many patents have been granted
for better techniques of extraction of zein from maize. Zein is classified
as a prolamin and is the alcohol-soluble protein of corn.16 Essentially, zein is a mixture of four proteins
of different molecular sizes and solubility: α, β, γ,
and δ.17 α-Zein accounts for
70% of the total content followed by 20% of γ-zein. Zein is
insoluble in water alone and is soluble in binary solvents such as
hydroalcoholic preparations.18

Zein
has been used in the manufacture of biodegradable plastics,
fibers, adhesives, coatings, inks, cosmetics, textiles, and chewing
gum.19 Currently, film coating has been
the most successful application of zein in the food and pharmaceutical
industry. Zein being a protein itself is expected to have molecular
interactions with protein-based active molecules and enhance their
loading and delivery. Surprisingly, to the best of our knowledge,
zein has never been used to prepare drug delivery devices including
microneedles. Here, we report for the first time, microneedles made
of zein for transcutaneous delivery of the model antigen, ovalbumin
(OVA).

Zein microneedles (ZMNs) were prepared using the micromolding
technique.
The disadvantages associated with traditional microfabrication-based
etching techniques, including high cost and difficult scale-up, can
be overcome by using the micromolding technique. Micromolding technique
requires a master mold that can be prepared using metal, silicon,
or polymers such as acrylanitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and a secondary
mold prepared using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). This PDMS mold can
be reused to make hundreds of polymeric microneedle arrays. Three-dimensional
(3D) printing technique was used to prepare the ABS master mold. The
ZMNs were evaluated for their feasibility to deliver OVA as a model
antigen into the skin for transcutaneous immunization.

Results and Discussion
Characterization
of ZMNs
ZMNs were fabricated using
the micromolding technique, where a poly-jet 3D printer was used to
print the master mold. Recently, 3D printing has been used to print
microstructures including microneedles.20 Only few polymeric materials can be fabricated into microstructures
using the 3D printing technique. Hence, the 3D printing technique
was used to produce master molds from ABS. These master molds were
then used to prepare PDMS production molds that were used in casting.
This micromolding technique is considered to be efficient because
the master mold and the production mold can be reused to cast several
microneedle arrays. Such a system can help in high volume manufacturing
at low production costs.21,22

Figure 1 shows the scheme of fabrication
of ZMNs. Figure 1d,e
shows a solvent-casted ZMN array and a microscopic image of two microneedles,
respectively. The needles are seen arranged in a 6 × 6 array
within an area of 1 cm2. The needles are conical in shape
with the average height and base width of 974.6 ± 13.8 and 362.7
± 13.8 μm (n = 10), respectively. The
surface of the microneedles was smooth with no observable stress on
the microneedle structures (Figure 1e).

The scale bar in “e” represents 500 μm.

Polymer microneedles need to have
sufficient mechanical strength
for penetration into the skin. It is expected that the needles do
not bend or break during handling and skin insertion. Texture analysis
showed a bending force of 16.09 ± 1.52 and 19.20 ± 1.75
N for blank and OVA-coated ZMNs, respectively (n =
3). The force–displacement curves showed no discontinuous point,
indicating no needle failure (Figure 2a). The forces required for OVA-coated ZMNs were greater
compared with those for uncoated ZMNs. In the absence of plasticizers,
ZMNs showed significantly (p < 0.05) lower bending
forces (Figure S3) and were observed to
be brittle.

a force of 0.4 N/needle (f) and 1.0 N/needle (g) using the texture
analyzer. A pretest speed of 1 mm/s and a test speed of 0.5 mm/s were
used.

To study the required skin insertional
force, the ZMNs were inserted
into the excised mouse skin at 0.4 and 1 N/needle. Figure 2b,c shows pores created on
the mouse skin and Parafilm with the application of 0.4 N/needle force. Figure 2d shows the micrograph
of the cryosectioned mouse skin with a single pore created after the
insertion of ZMNs at 0.4 N/needle force. The needles did not bend
or break with the application of 0.4 N/needle force (Figure 2f). On the other hand, Figure 2g shows a bent ZMN
upon the application of 1 N/needle force.

Zein has been widely
studied for its film-forming properties. Zein
films were found to be brittle in the absence of plasticizers.20 The flexibility of zein films improved with
the addition of plasticizers. The effect of plasticizers including
glycerol, triethylene glycol, dibutyl tartrate, levulinic acid, polyethylene
glycol (PEG) 300, and oleic acid on the mechanical properties and
moisture content of the films has been studied. Similarly, ZMNs without
plasticizers showed a brittle behavior. The needle tips were broken
with the application of <0.4 N/needle force. Furthermore, the microneedle
base plate cracked during handling and pressing onto the skin. To
improve the strength of the microneedle array, glycerol and PEG 400
were incorporated as plasticizers in the polymer matrix. Both glycerol
and PEG have previously been reported as compatible plasticizers with
zein.20 Previous study showed that a force
of 5 N was optimal for the efficient insertion of polyvinyl alcohol
microneedles inside of the porcine skin.23 For ZMNs, only 0.4 N/needle was sufficient. The skin insertion force
will depend on the shape, aspect ratio, needle-tip diameter, and distance
of separation between the microneedles. Because polymer microneedles
are weaker (smaller Young’s modulus compared with that of metal
microneedles), they need to have a wider base for additional mechanical
strength. ZMNs were prepared with an aspect ratio of 2.64 with approximate
tip radius and separation between microneedles of 30 and 1160 μm,
respectively.

Insertion of OVA-Coated ZMNs into the Mouse
Skin
Fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC)-tagged OVA was used to visualize the OVA delivery
inside of the skin. The absence of free FITC in the FITC–OVA
conjugate was confirmed using thin layer chromatography (Figure S1). FITC conjugation was confirmed using
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic studies by the absence
of a characteristic isothiocyanate stretching band at 2018 cm–1 and the appearance of thiourea bands at 1100–1500
and 400–600 cm–1 wavenumbers (Figure S2). UV–visible (UV–vis)
spectroscopy was used to determine the number of moles of FITC conjugated
to 1 mol of OVA. It was found that λmax of free FITC
(490 nm) shifted to 495 nm wavelength after conjugation with OVA (Figure S1). UV–vis spectroscopic analysis
showed 1.23 mol of FITC conjugated to 1 mol of OVA.

Figure 3a,b shows the fluorescence
images of FITC–OVA-coated ZMNs before and after the insertion
into the skin for 30 min. Figure 3a shows the uniform coating of ZMNs with FITC–OVA.
The intensity of fluorescence decreased after 30 min insertion of
ZMNs inside of the skin (Figure 3b).

to 250 μm inside of the skin, and 3D representation of the microchannel

areas indicate lack of fluorescence. The scale bar represents 250
μm. SC, stratum corneum and E, epidermis.

Figure 3c
shows
the confocal micrographs of the skin after 30 min insertion of FITC–OVA-coated
ZMNs at varying depths. The series of micrographs show a single pore
created by the microneedle insertion. The fluorescence associated
with FITC–OVA was seen up to a depth of 250 μm inside
of the skin. Figure 3d shows a reconstructed 3D image of the microchannel created within
the skin. The pore can be seen tapering down from the stratum corneum
to the epidermis. The results from confocal microscopy confirm that
the fluorescence intensity lost from the microneedle surface after
insertion into the skin can be attributed to the adsorption of FITC–OVA
within the skin.

Skin Disposition of the OVA Delivered Using
ZMNs
The
amount of OVA entrapped or coated on ZMNs was measured using an indirect
method. For all samples, the amount of OVA released from the ZMNs
was determined after incubation in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
for 1 h. The amount of OVA released from the ZMNs entrapped with OVA
was 0.088 ± 0.014 mg in 1 h. On the other hand, 0.766 ±
0.144 mg of OVA was released from the ZMNs coated with OVA. The amount
of OVA released from the microneedles that were previously inserted
inside of the skin for 30 min was reduced to 0.124 ± 0.018 mg.

Vitamin B-coated stainless steel microneedles showed a delivery
efficiency of 90% in the excised pig skin.24 Similarly, influenza virus-coated stainless steel microneedles showed
70% delivery efficiency.25 Here, OVA-coated
ZMNs showed a delivery efficiency of 85% in the excised mouse skin.

Stability of the OVA-Coated ZMNs
Sodium dodecyl sulfate
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed for OVA
samples released before and after the insertion of ZMNs into the skin. Figure 4a shows the bands
for OVA released from the ZMNs. The single band at 43 kDa shows that
the OVA was intact after coating on ZMNs.

a texture analyzer for ZMNs stored at 2–8 °C (f), at RT
(g), and at 40 °C/75% relative humidity (RH) (h) on different
days. The results represent the average of three replicates. AS, accelerated
storage (40 °C, 75 ± 5% RH).

Figure 4b
shows
the amount of OVA released from coated microneedles in 1 h after storage
under different environmental conditions for up to 90 days. The amount
of OVA released reduces with time under all storage conditions. The
increase in the storage temperature from 2–8 to 40 °C
reduced the amount of OVA released from the ZMNs. Similarly, Figure 4c shows the OVA bands
after SDS-PAGE, where the band densities decreased with the increase
in the storage temperature. OVA has been shown to form aggregates
in less than 2 min at temperature between 70 and 80 °C, as confirmed
using gel permeation chromatography and differential scanning calorimetry.26

CD spectroscopy was used to study the
secondary structure of OVA
after storage under different environmental conditions. Figure 4d,e shows the residual molar
ellipticity versus wavelength graphs for OVA released from ZMNs stored
under different stability conditions. The CD spectra of native OVA
showed two strong negative minima at 208 and 222 nm wavelengths. These
bands are indicative of the α-helical structure of OVA.27 There was no significant change in the minima
at 208 and 222 nm after storage of OVA-coated ZMNs under cold conditions
and at room conditions for up to 60 days. The CD spectra of OVA after
90-day storage changed in comparison with the native structure. The
decrease in the intensity of all α-helix bands shows a change
in the native structure after 90-day storage (Figure 4d,e). Maintenance of the structural integrity
of a protein is essential for its activity. The CD spectroscopy results
indicated that the secondary structure of OVA was not greatly altered
upon storage under cold and room conditions for up to 60 days.

Figure 4f–h
shows the force versus displacement plots obtained from the texture
analyzer for ZMNs stored under different stability conditions for
up to 90 days. There was no significant (p > 0.05)
decrease in the break force for ZMNs stored at RT or under cold conditions.
However, when stored under accelerated conditions, the break force
decreased significantly (p < 0.05) compared with
that of the newly prepared ZMNs. This indicates that the needles become
softer during storage under accelerated conditions, and the mechanical
strength of ZMNs depends on the temperature and humidity of the storage
conditions.

Good stability of antigen-entrapped polymeric microneedles
has
been reported over different storage periods and conditions, although
long-term and stress stability data for such formulations are limited.28,29 It has been proposed that coating of vaccines on microneedles can
reduce the need for cold chain maintenance in contrast to injectable
vaccine formulations.30 Here, we provide
a proof-of-concept, where antigen-coated ZMNs were relatively stable
under room conditions. However, further studies are required to investigate
whether this phenomenon can be extended for a longer duration and
be applicable for other antigens.

Skin Penetration of Bacteria
after ZMN and Hypodermic Needle
Pretreatment
Staphylococcus epidermidis was labeled with FITC under alkaline conditions. The bacterial suspension
was serially diluted, plated onto agar, and incubated at 37 °C
for 24–48 h for validating the cfu/mL concentration. A smear
of bacterial suspension on a glass slide was examined under a confocal
microscope for bacterial morphology and fluorescence due to FITC labeling. Figure 5 shows the confocal
images captured under bright field and dark field. S. epidermidis can be seen arranged in grape clusterlike
structures.31 Surface conjugation of bacteria
with FITC and other dyes has previously been reported.32 The bacteria are reported to be 1–2 μm
in size, which can also be seen in Figure 5c. S. epidermidis formed raised, white colored, distinct colonies when grown on nutrient
agar plates.31

lens. (c) Bacteria size measurement photographed using 20× objective

represents the significantly different values (p <
0.0001, t-test).

Table 2 shows the extent of skin penetration of S.
epidermidis. In the control group, 1.27 ± 0.12
× 106 cfu was found to be adhered to the skin surface
out of 107 cfu bacteria placed in the donor compartment.
This number was taken as the denominator for calculating the percentage
of bacteria permeated across the skin or adhered to treatment devices.
Approximately fourfold greater cfu of bacteria adhered to the ZMNs
compared with the hypodermic needle. This can be attributed to the
greater exposed surface area of ZMNs (117 mm2) compared
with the 24G hypodermic syringe (70 mm2). The bacteria
adhered to the biopsy punch was on the order of 105 cfu.
After the application of ZMNs on the skin, the permeation of bacteria
increased up to 6 h and then plateaued off over the next 18 h (Figure 5d). Of the total
bacterial load, 3.29% bacteria permeated across the skin punctured
with the hypodermic needle in 24 h. Meanwhile, after ZMN treatment,
it was only 0.44% of the total bacterial count. This could be related
to the bigger size of the pore created by the hypodermic needle compared
with the microneedles.32

A confocal microscope was used to
compare the depth of skin penetration
of S. epidermidis after the application
of the hypodermic needle or ZMN. Figure 6 shows the optical sections of the skin at
varying depths from the surface up to 230 μm in the XYZ plane. The fluorescence associated with the bacteria
can be found up to a depth of 230 and 120 μm inside of the skin
after treatment with the hypodermic needle and the ZMN, respectively. Figure 6b,e shows the 3D
reconstructed image.

Earlier reports claimed lower microbial penetration in the
skin
after the microneedle treatment; however, only a few reports presented
experimental results. Donnelly and co-workers compared the penetration
of radiolabeled microorganisms S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans through porcine skin after treatment
with a hypodermic needle or a microneedle array. Following hypodermic
needle treatment, 48.0 and 3.5% of load on the stratum corneum was
detected in the receptor compartment for C. albicans and S. epidermidis after 24 h.33

Transcutaneous Immunization Using OVA-Coated
ZMNs
Three
strategies can be used to deliver drugs into the skin using solid
microneedles.34 In this study, we have
compared three approaches to study OVA-specific immunization including
OVA topical application after ZMN pretreatment, OVA-entrapped ZMNs,
and OVA-coated ZMNs.

Mice were immunized with a primary and
two booster doses. Figure 7 shows the total IgG (a), IgG1 (b), and IgG2a (c) anti-OVA
antibody response on days 0, 21, 42, and 63 for different groups.
A time-dependent increase in the antibody titers was observed after
immunization using all formulations. Blank ZMNs were also studied
to investigate any nonspecific immune response. No significant antibody
response was found for blank ZMNs in comparison with the control animal
group. Intradermal injection of OVA induced significantly (p < 0.05) greater antibody response for IgG, IgG1, and
IgG2a compared with that of the control group. All mice that were
intradermally injected with OVA produced specific IgG antibodies after
the prime immunization. In the case of OVA-coated ZMNs, induction
of an antibody response was slower compared with OVA administered
through intradermal injection. After day 42 and 64, the antibody response
for OVA-coated ZMNs and OVA intradermal injection was significantly
higher (p < 0.001) compared with that of control
and treatment with blank. As the initial administered dose of OVA
was different among different ZMN administration strategies and intradermal
injection, the antibody response among these groups was not statistically
compared (Figure 7).
In the case of OVA-entrapped ZMNs or OVA topical application after
ZMN pretreatment, there was no significant improvement in the antibody
response compared with that of the control group. Furthermore, it
was found that OVA administered through intradermal and coated ZMNs
provided greater humoral immune response (IgG1 response) compared
with the cellular response (IgG2a response, Figure 7).

Figure 7 OVA-specific serum IgG (a), IgG1 (b), and IgG2a
(c) responses delivered
using ZMNs and intradermal vaccination. Results are shown as mean
± standard error of the mean (SEM) (n = 4),
and statistical significance was determined using a two-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) with a Bonferroni post-test. (*) and (•)
represent the significantly different (p < 0.001)
values compared with those of control and blank ZMNs, respectively,
for the corresponding days. It should be noted that the amount of
OVA delivered was approximately 100 times greater for OVA-coated ZMNs
compared with OVA intradermal administration.

Application of OVA-coated microneedle arrays to BALB/c mice
resulted
in greater antibody response. However, it should be noted that the
initial loading dose was different for the three different administration
strategies. Furthermore, the amount of OVA released within the skin
was different for OVA-coated ZMNs and OVA-entrapped ZMNs. It should
be noted that a significantly greater amount of OVA was required when
OVA was delivered using coated ZMNs to show antibody response similar
to intradermal administration. This could be attributed to the physical
and chemical changes in OVA during the preparation and application
of OVA-coated ZMNs. There are several reports with OVA immunization
using microneedle arrays. van der Maaden et al. have reported mice
immunized with OVA-coated pH-sensitive silicon microneedle arrays.35 Effective induction of IgG responses was observed
compared with intradermal or subcutaneous OVA injection. However,
similar to the results from the present study, the induction time
was longer and required successive immunizations. Widera and co-workers
reported significantly greater OVA-specific IgG responses with OVA-coated
400 μm long microneedles than that with OVA intramuscular injection
in hairless guinea pig model.36 The size
and shape of the needles were shown to influence the delivery of OVA
into the skin and the subsequent immune response. Higher OVA-specific
IgG response was found after application of OVA-loaded nanoparticles
on mouse skin previously treated with longer microneedles (1000 μm)
compared with shorter microneedles (200 and 500 μm).37 By contrast, other studies reported no effect
of microneedle length on OVA delivery.36 Topical application of OVA after ZMN pretreatment did not result
in greater immune response. This could be attributed to the lower
penetration of OVA in the skin through the pores created by ZMNs.
While more studies would be required to understand the transport of
OVA through skin pores created by ZMNs, the negatively charged OVA
at neutral pH may penetrate less through the negatively charged skin.
Further studies using OVA and other model antigens would be required
to provide a greater understanding on the influence of coating and
the release mechanism on transcutaneous antigen presentation. These
results would encourage further investigation in the utilization of
ZMNs to deliver antigen for immunization against infectious agents
such as influenza virus.

Splenocyte Proliferation Assay
Long-term
memory response
is one of the key features of an effective vaccine delivery system.
The ability of memory T-cells to recognize the antigen can be determined
by studying the proliferation of splenocytes of preimmunized mice
upon restimulation with antigen. The use of MTT assay for this purpose
has been reported earlier.38 The proliferation
of splenocytes was higher in the OVA intradermal and the OVA-coated
ZMN group when restimulated with OVA. The stimulation index (SI) of
OVA-coated ZMNs was significantly higher (p <
0.05) compared with that of the control group (Figure 8). The increased proliferation of splenocytes
in mice treated with OVA-coated ZMNs suggests their ability to enhance
the antigen presentation to the T-cells and to induce a long-lasting
immune response.

Park Memorial
Institute (RPMI) 1640 alone, OVA, and concanavalin A mitogen for 72
h. SI was calculated by dividing the absorbance value of concanavalin

Conclusions
We
have shown here that biodegradable and generally regarded as
safe (GRAS) zein can be molded to achieve a microneedle array. This
microneedle array showed sufficient mechanical strength to penetrate
the skin. This is the first time zein protein is used for the preparation
of a microneedle array. Zein can be easily casted and shows potential
for scale-up using the micromolding technique. The model antigen,
OVA can be entrapped or coated on to ZMNs. OVA-loaded ZMNs were stable
and provided a significantly lower microbial penetration compared
with the application of a conventional hypodermic needle. The approach
of OVA-coated ZMNs was found efficient in skin delivery of OVA compared
with that of OVA-entrapped ZMNs and topical OVA application after
ZMN pretreatment. However, a larger dose of OVA-coated ZMNs is required
to elicit a similar antibody response compared with that of intradermal
administration. Taken together, ZMN can be developed for potential
delivery of antigen for transcutaneous immunization.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Zein and FITC were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
Chemical Company (Bengaluru, India). OVA from chicken egg white (catalog
number A5503, with ≥98% assay) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
Chemical Company and was used without any further purification. Sylgard
184 was purchased from Dow Corning (Midland, MI, USA). Stock cultures
of S. epidermidis were obtained from
Microbial Type Culture Collection and Gene Bank (MTCC), Chandigarh,
India. Nutrient agar, nutrient media, RPMI 1640 culture medium, fetal
bovine serum (FBS), and penicillin were purchased from Himedia Labs,
India. HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a were purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., USA. Milli-Q (Millipore, USA)
water was used for all experiments.

Fabrication of ZMNs
Pro/ENGINEER (PTC Creo 2.0) was
used to design the microneedle arrays and generate stereolithography
(STL) files for 3D printing. The microneedles in the primary mold
were designed with a length of 1500 μm, base diameter of 400
μm, and a tip radius of 25 μm. The array was designed
to contain 36 microprojections in 1 cm2 area in a 6 ×
6 pattern. This design was used to print acrylonitrile butadiene styrene
(ABS) master mold using a poly-jet 3D printer (Objet30 Scholar, Stratasys
Inc., USA). This master mold was subsequently used for the fabrication
of a production mold made of PDMS. Sylgard 184 silicone elastomer
and a curing agent were mixed in a 10:1 w/w ratio and allowed to stand
for 30 min for the removal of air bubbles. This mixture was poured
over the ABS mold until it was completely filled. Entrapped air bubbles
were removed by vacuum application for 10 min. The PDMS mixture was
then allowed to bake at 100 °C for 4 h in a hot air oven. Completely
cured samples were then kept in a freezer to shrink and remove the
PDMS mold.

Zein (60 w/w %) was prepared using 90% ethanol. Glycerol
(10 w/w %) and PEG 400 (10 w/w %) were used as plasticizers. This
mixture was added to the PDMS molds under vacuum and allowed to air-dry
for 48 h. Then, the ZMNs were carefully removed and used for characterization.

Characterization of ZMNs
The prepared ZMNs were examined
for uniformity, length of the needle, and base diameter using an optical
microscope (Olympus IX53, Olympus, Japan). The mechanical strength
of the ZMNs and the required skin insertion force were studied using
a texture analyzer (Stable Microsystems, UK). For determining the
mechanical strength, a microneedle array was placed on a heavy duty
platform with needles facing upwards. A 10 mm cylindrical Delrin probe
(part code P/10) connected to a 50 kg load cell was set at the same
distance from the platform for all test measurements. The texture
analyzer was set in the compression mode with the probe compressing
the microneedle array at a speed of 0.5 mm/s to a maximum distance
of 0.8 mm. The probe was held in place for 5 s. ZMNs prepared without
adding plasticizers were also characterized using the same experimental
parameters. Force versus displacement curve was plotted to calculate
the bending force. The excised mouse skin was used to determine the
required skin insertion force for the penetration of microneedles.
A double-sided adhesive tape was used to adhere the ZMNs to a moveable
10 mm cylindrical probe. The skin sample was secured on a polystyrene
block with the epidermis facing the probe. The probe was lowered onto
the skin at a speed of 0.5 mm/s and a force of 0.4 or 1 N/needle was
applied. Later, the skin sample was stained with methylene blue for
20 min for the visualization of pores. Photographs of the ZMNs were
collected before and after insertion using a digital camera (Canon
EOS 1200D with Canon EF 100 mm f/2.8 Macro USM lens).

Preparation
of OVA-Entrapped or OVA-Coated ZMNs
Two
strategies were followed to load OVA in the microneedles. For the
preparation of OVA-entrapped ZMNs, OVA was added to the zein mixture
in the water phase, and then, this mixture was used for ZMN casting.
The amount of OVA entrapped in a single needle was calculated using eq 1. 1  

OVA-coated ZMNs were prepared
by the
dip-coating method. The ZMNs were dipped in OVA (40 mg/mL, HEPES buffer,
pH 7.0) for 30 min. The coated ZMNs were allowed to air-dry for 24
h.

In Vitro Release of OVA from ZMNs
In vitro release
studies were performed by placing the microneedle array in a phosphate
buffer (pH 7.4) in a 12-well plate such that only needles were in
contact with the buffer medium. The system was incubated in a shaker
at 37 °C and 40 rpm. Samples were withdrawn from the media after
1 h. The OVA concentration in the release samples was determined using
Bradford’s assay. For that, 250 μL of Bradford’s
reagent was added to 5 μL of the sample in a 96-well plate and
incubated for 10 min. The absorbance was recorded at 595 nm wavelength.
The concentration was determined after comparison with a standard
calibration curve (0.1–1.4 mg/mL of OVA, R2 = 0.999).

The amount of OVA released in the phosphate
buffer after the insertion of ZMNs into the excised skin was evaluated.
The OVA-coated ZMNs were inserted into the mouse skin for 30 min.
Then, the amount of OVA released from the ZMNs in 1 h was determined
using Bradford’s assay.

Stability of OVA-Coated
ZMNs
The stability of OVA released
from the OVA-coated ZMNs was determined using SDS-PAGE (5% stacking
gel and 12% resolving gel, 0.75 mm thickness). OVA released from the
OVA-coated ZMNs before and after the insertion into the excised mouse
skin was collected and mixed with 5× sample loading buffer [β-mercaptoethanol
(5%), bromophenol blue (0.02%), glycerol (30%), SDS (10%), and Tris-Cl
(250 mM, pH 6.8)]. Electrophoresis was performed in a vertical gel
electrophoresis unit (Hoefer Inc., USA) at 100 V for 2 h. Protein
bands were visualized (Gel Doc XR+ Imaging System, Bio-Rad,
USA) after staining with Coomassie brilliant blue.

The physical
stability of OVA-coated ZMNs and OVA was studied after storage under
different environmental conditions. Blank and OVA-coated ZMNs were
stored under cold conditions (2–8 °C), at RT, and under
accelerated storage conditions (40 ± 2 °C and 75 ±
5% RH) (Table 1). Different
OVA-coated ZMN samples were collected after 15, 30, 60, and 90 days
for analysis.

The amount of OVA released from the coated ZMNs
in 1 h in the phosphate
buffer (pH 7.2) was determined using Bradford’s assay. The
integrity of the released OVA was studied using SDS-PAGE as described
above. The secondary structure of OVA released from the ZMNs was evaluated
using CD spectroscopy (Jasco J-1500 CD spectrometer). For that, the
samples were dialyzed against a degassed buffer (10 mM KH2PO4 and 50 mM Na2SO4, pH 7.4) overnight
and filtered using a 0.22 μm membrane filter before the analysis.
Far-UV spectra were recorded between 250 and 200 nm wavelengths using
a cuvette of 0.1 cm path length at 25 °C. Process parameters
including scan speed (50 nm/min), data pitch (1 nm), data integration
time (1 s), and number of accumulations (3) were kept constant. Data
were represented as mean residue ellipticity (deg cm2/dmol)
after buffer subtraction.

Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM)
For CLSM
studies, OVA was labeled with FITC. FITC [3 mg/mL FITC in anhydrous
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)] was added dropwise to 4 mL of OVA solution
(25 mg/mL in carbonate buffer, pH 9) under continuous stirring. The
reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C. Free FITC was removed
from the conjugate by dialyzing against PBS (pH 7.4) using a regenerated
cellulose membrane (mol wt cutoff 12 kDa, Spectrum Labs, USA). Thin
layer chromatography with a mobile phase containing chloroform/methanol/ammonium
hydroxide (5:4:1) was performed to confirm the complete removal of
free FITC. The number of moles of FITC conjugated to OVA was determined
using UV–vis spectroscopy (SpectraMax M4, Molecular Devices
Inc., USA). The conjugate was also characterized using FTIR (FT/IR-4200,
Jasco Inc., USA). Samples (2 mg) were mixed with potassium bromide
in a 1:100 ratio before the analysis. Spectra were recorded in the
range of 4000–400 cm–1 wavenumber at a spectral
resolution of 2 cm–1 in a dynamic reflectance sample
holder.

FITC–OVA was coated on ZMNs as described above.
Then, FITC–OVA-coated ZMNs were inserted into the excised BALB/c
mouse skin. Fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX53, Olympus Corporation,
Japan) was used to capture the fluorescence micrograph of ZMNs before
and after the insertion into the skin.

To evaluate the depth
of penetration of ZMNs and the release of
OVA within the skin, CLSM studies were performed. Previously shaved
excised mouse skin was used for the insertion of FITC–OVA-coated
ZMNs. The ZMNs were inserted into the skin and held in place for 30
min using an occlusive tape. After the removal of ZMNs, the skin sample
was placed on a glass slide and held with a cellophane tape. Argon
laser (488 nm wavelength) was used to excite FITC, and the emission
intensity was detected at 520 nm wavelength. Images were captured
in the XYZ plane (plane parallel to the mouse skin)
using a 10× objective lens. The skin surface (z = 0 μm) was defined as the imaging plane with the brightest
fluorescence. Optical sections were obtained at a 1 μm step
size from the skin surface through the z-axis. Other
parameters including scan size (512 × 512), scan speed (400 Hz),
pinhole (53 μm), pinhole airy (1 AU) laser (0.7998% of 0.0390
W), and gain (100) were kept constant. The 3D confocal reconstruction
images were also obtained to visualize the penetration of microneedles
in the skin.

Histological Examination
The excised
BALB/c mouse abdominal
skin was mounted on a polystyrene block, and OVA-coated ZMNs were
inserted in the skin for 30 min. Then, the skin sample was embedded
in an optimum cutting temperature (OCT) compound at −80 °C.
The skin sample was sectioned at a thickness of 6 μm using a
cryostat (CM1520, Leica Biosystems, Germany). Later, the skin sections
were dried overnight and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (Sigma-Aldrich).
Microscopic images were acquired using an optical microscope.

Skin Penetration
of Bacteria after ZMN Application
To study the influence
of ZMN application on skin penetration of
microorganisms, FITC-labeled S. epidermidis was used. Freeze-dried S. epidermidis (MTCC 435) cultures were reconstituted using a nutrient medium and
subcultured twice. Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation
at 10 000g at 4 °C for 5 min. The bacterial
cells were then resuspended in 1 mL of 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate buffer.
The optical density was measured at 600 nm and adjusted at 0.1 to
obtain 107 cfu/mL. This was further validated by total
viable counting upon plating onto agar plates and counting after incubating
at 37 °C for 24–48 h. FITC stock solution (250 μL
of 10 mg/mL in DMSO) was added for every 5 mL of bacterial suspension.
The culture was incubated while shaking for 30 min in the dark. Then,
the bacterial cells were washed three times with sterile phosphate
buffer to remove unbound FITC. The cells were resuspended in the nutrient
medium, and the optical density was determined. A sample of 1 μL
volume was smeared onto a glass slide, fixed with heat, and observed
under bright field and a fluorescence microscope. The bacterial suspension
was stored at 2–8 °C for not more than 1 week for further
experimentation.

The permeation of S. epidermidis across the mouse skin was studied using a Franz diffusion cell apparatus
(Permegear Inc., USA). The skin sample was sandwiched between the
donor and receptor compartments (5 mL of degassed and sterilized PBS).
The complete setup was maintained at 37 °C by recirculating water
from a temperature-controlled water bath. The donor compartment was
charged with 1 mL aliquot of FITC-labeled S. epidermidis (107 cfu) and incubated for 24 h under sterile conditions.
The donor compartment was covered with Parafilm. After 24 h, the culture
from the donor compartment was withdrawn, and the skin sample was
treated in three different methods: puncturing with a hypodermic needle,
inserting the ZMNs, and disrupting the skin using a biopsy punch.
A 24G hypodermic needle was inserted completely into the skin and
removed within 30 s. The ZMNs were inserted in the skin sample for
30 min. ZMNs were previously exposed to UV light for 15 min for reducing
bioburden. A sterile biopsy punch of diameter 8 mm was used to disrupt
the skin surface by punching. The used hypodermic syringe, ZMNs, and
biopsy punch were placed in 5 mL of sterile PBS and ultrasonicated
for 15 min to dislodge all bacteria. This PBS sample was plated on
agar and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h to count the colony-forming
units. Similarly, for control measurements, the bacteria attached
to the skin surface were dislodged and plated onto agar for total
viable colony counting.

Furthermore, samples (100 μL)
were withdrawn from the receptor
compartment after 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 12, and 24 h of skin treatment.
Total viable count of bacteria was determined after 24 h of incubation
at 37 °C in nutrient agar. For CLSM studies, the skin sample
was placed on a glass slide and held with cellophane tape. Images
were acquired using CLSM as described above.

Transcutaneous Immunization
Studies
Female BALB/c mice
(4–6 weeks) were procured from National Institute of Nutrition,
Hyderabad, India. All experiments were performed after approval from
the institutional animal ethics committee (IAEC) of BITS, Pilani.
The mice were fed with a standard laboratory diet and were provided
with clean drinking water ad libitum. The animals were divided into
six groups of five mice in each group. The groups include (1) control
(no ZMN insertion); (2) blank ZMN; (3) OVA-entrapped ZMN; (4) OVA-coated
ZMN; (5) blank ZMN insertion followed by OVA solution application;
and (6) OVA intradermal injection. OVA intradermal injections were
given by dissolving OVA in PBS (pH 7.4). For topical immunization,
the mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (E-Z systems, USA), and
the dorsal skin was shaved using a hair clipper. The skin was wiped
with 70% ethanol. The ZMN was inserted into the skin and held in place
using an occlusive tape. The ZMN was inserted for 30 min or 4 h for
OVA-coated ZMN and OVA-entrapped ZMN, respectively. For OVA application
after ZMN pretreatment, the OVA solution was topically applied after
1 min insertion of the blank ZMN. The amount of OVA administered through
intradermal injection was 5 μg. The amount of OVA topically
applied after ZMN pretreatment was 100 μg. On the other hand,
the amount of OVA delivered using a ZMN that was released within the
skin after the insertion is not quantified. However, OVA release studies
(1 h sampling) were performed to determine approximately the amount
of OVA released inside of the skin. The amount of OVA available within
the skin after OVA-entrapped ZMN insertion was ∼80 μg.
In the case of OVA-coated ZMNs, the total OVA released was ∼600
μg. For all treatment groups, the mice were immunized on days
1, 22, and 43. Blood samples were collected from the retro-orbital
plexus on days 21, 42, and 63. The serum was separated from the blood
by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C and stored at
−80 °C for further analysis.

The enzyme- linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique was used to determine the OVA-specific
antibodies (IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a) in the serum samples. High binding
flat bottom microtiter plates (96-well, Himedia Labs, India) were
coated with OVA (1 μg/well in bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6). The
plates were incubated at 4 °C overnight. Then, the unbound antigen
was removed by washing three times with a wash buffer (PBS 7.4 + 0.05%
Tween 20). Free sites were blocked with 200 μL of blocking buffer
[PBS 7.4 + 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) + 0.05% TWEEN 20] for 30
min followed by a three-time wash step. Serum samples (100 μL,
diluted 1:200 for total IgG, 1:160 for IgG1, and 1:40 for IgG2a in
the sample diluent, PBS 7.4 + 1% BSA) were added to the wells and
incubated for 1 h. Later, HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG/IgG1/IgG2a
(100 μL; 1:6000 in the sample diluent) was incubated for 1 h
followed by a five-time wash step. Finally, 100 μL of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine
(TMB) substrate solution was added to each well and incubated in the
dark for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μL of
2 N H2SO4. The absorbance intensity was determined
at 450 nm wavelength using a microplate reader (SpectraMax M4, Molecular
Devices Inc., USA), and antibody titers were determined against a
standard calibration curve.

Splenocyte Proliferation Assay
In
vitro splenocyte
proliferation assay was performed to investigate the ability of memory
T-cells to recognize the antigen upon restimulation. The mice were
killed on day 64 after immunization, and the spleen was harvested
under sterile conditions. The spleen was placed in ice-cold PBS (pH
7.4) and gently mashed using the back of a syringe plunger. The loose
spleen mass was then passed through a cell strainer (40 μm pore
size, Himedia Labs, India) into 15 mL centrifuge tubes. The tubes
were centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 5 min. The cells were washed twice
with ice-cold PBS, and a single cell suspension of splenocytes was
prepared in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1% FBS. The suspension
was centrifuged at 2500 rpm at 25 °C for 5 min, and the supernatant
was discarded. RBC lysis buffer (150 mM NH4Cl, 10 mM KHCO3, and 1 mM EDTA-2Na, pH 7.2) was added to lyse the erythrocytes.
The cells were again centrifuged after the addition of RPMI 1640 medium.
The pellet was redispersed in RPMI 1640 media, and the cells were
counted using a Neubauer chamber. Splenocytes were seeded in a 96-well
plate at 50 000 cells/well and treated with the blank RPMI
medium, OVA (50 μg/mL), or positive control concanavalin A mitogen
(Con A) (1 μg/mL) for 72 h. At the end of treatment, the medium
was removed, and the cells were incubated with 50 μL of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) solution (0.5 mg/mL) for 4 h. Then, DMSO (150 μL)
was added to dissolve the formazan crystals. The absorbance was measured
at 540 nm using a UV–vis spectrophotometer. SI was calculated
using eq 2. 2
