a novel lab-on-a-paper (LoP)-based device
coupled with a molybdenum disulfide nanosheet (MoS2NS)-modified
electrochemical genosensor for detecting Salmonella-specific DNA. Conductive electrodes were grafted on a paper-based
substrate employing a stencil printing technique, and MoS2NS was decorated on the working electrode. MoS2NS has
strong affinity toward nucleo bases, which made it a best sensing
interface for the immobilization of DNA. Morphological, optical, and
structural characterizations were accomplished using X-ray diffraction
(XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM),
UV–vis spectroscopy (UV–vis), and Raman spectroscopy,
repectively. The current studies of an electrochemical genosensor
demonstrated a good linear detection range from 100–20 nM and
a low limit of detection of 20 nM toward Salmonella DNA with R2 = 0.991. The proposed LoP-based
genosensor confirmed as a better sensing podium and an effectual immobilization
matrix for DNA.

Introduction
Salmonella enteritidis-based epidemics from different
sources of food have been raised the public awareness due to its worldwide
severity. Salmonella enterica, includes
more than 2500 diverse serotypes, causes 17–21 million reported
cases each year globally.1−7 Various conventional methods are available for the pathogen detection.
These methods have some setbacks in regard to accuracy and coinfection
with other pathogens along with; they are time-consuming process as
it requires laborious preparation.8 They
are time consuming such as slow growth due to which an excess time
is lapsed to get the final result, which can turn out to be fatal.
To overcome these drawbacks, other modern molecular biology techniques,
namely, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain
reaction (PCR), have been in use. But these methods have some traditional
limitations such as prolonged multiple enrichment steps, potential
for false positive, cross contaminations, and failed reactions due
to the presence of inhibitory substances that leads to inconsistent
results.9−12 There is an extensive need for fast and accurate diagnosis of Salmonella for the effective management of the infectious
diseases caused by this pathogen.

Electrochemical biosensor
promises great reliability and specificity
toward pathogen detection, food safety, and quality control.13−17 Herein, a smart approach, that is, lab-on-a-paper (LoP) device,
coupled with a performant biomolecular sensing system, which could
assure an effective personalized management of disease related to
salmonella, was used. The LoP device offers many advantages over a
macroelectrode-based electrochemical technique such as allowing low
consumption of the sample, device-portability, and an easy technique
to overcome the complex laboratory functions. A paper substrate was
used for the fabrication of microelectrodes that further encapsulated
with hydrophobic barriers and functionalized with a biomolecule. Biomolecule
sensors have capabilities that can be converted into a diagnostic
platform, which is perfectly compatible with point-of-care testing
(PoCT).17−20 For a rapid and low-cost detection of Salmonella, various biomolecules are being introduced in biosensors such as
DNA, RNA, aptamer, and antibody. In the present study, we employed
a DNA probe of the inv A virulent gene of Salmonella, which is responsible for the penetration into the intestinal epithelium.21−24 A genosensor offers specificity associated with DNA base pairing,
sensitivity, and rapidity that is required to solve all aforementioned
drawbacks.25

Many metal dichalcogenides
have captivating interest in the field
of sensing attributed to their higher electron transfer capacity and
large surface area.26−28 MoS2NS is consist of sandwiched layers
of Mo and sulfur that are bonded together by van der Waals weak forces.
MoS2NS adsorb the ssDNA via van der Waals interaction.29 Furthermore, the layered structure of MoS2 has an excellent biocompatibility and a functional active
site, which enhance the planar electrical transportation activity
for sensing application.30−35 It was demonstrated that the self-assembled nanoarchitecture was
easily dispersed and assembled as nanosheets on a paper-based device.

As per our knowledge, a paper-based platform for electrochemical
sensing of Salmonella-specific DNA, using 2D nanomaterials,
is yet to be studied. Furthermore, MoS2 facilitates many
electroactive sites, defects, and high surface areas that leads to
an increase in the sensitivity and selectivity of the electrochemical
paper-based LoP devices.36,37

Results and Discussion
Structural
and Morphological Characterization of MoS2
Figure 1a,b shows the morphology
of the MoS2 nanosheets as observed
by TEM. TEM images revealed that MoS2 nanosheets are composed
of more than five layers with an interlayer spacing of around 0.689
nm.

bars.

The phase and crystal structure
identification of the synthesized
MoS2 has been studied by XRD as given in Figure 2a. The presence of crystalline
diffraction peaks indicates that synthesized MoS2 was crystalline
in nature. The peaks at 14.35, 33.31, 38.10, 44.32, 58.97,64.56, and
77.67° were assigned to (002), (100), (103), (006), (110), (0111),
and (0010), respectively. The XRD peaks are attributed to hexagonal
phase (JCPDS card nos. 17-0744 and JCPDS-37-1492).38,39

Figure 2 MoS2 nanosheet characterizations: (a) XRD, (b) Raman
spectra, and (c) UV–vis spectrum.

Raman spectra illustrated the evolution in structural parameters
when the 3D bulk block material changes into a 2D van der Waals bonded
layered architecture and depicted about the quality and number of
layers present in a 2D-layered material. Figure 2b shows the Raman spectra of MoS2 nanosheets synthesized by a hydrothermal process for 24 h. Two prominent
peaks were observed at 383 and 408 cm–1(E2g1 and A1g modes). The E2g1 mode can be attributed to in-plane vibration molybdenum atoms along
a particular direction while the sulfur atom in the other. The A1g mode is out of plane vibrations of sulfur located at 408
cm–1. The distance between these two Raman peaks
is ∼25 cm–1, which implies the formation
of MoS2 nanosheets.40Figure 2c shows the UV–vis
spectrum of MoS2 nanosheets sonicated in N-methyl-2- pyrrolidone (NMP) for 8 h. Two characteristic peaks were
detected at 613 and 673 nm (2.02 and 1.84 eV, respectively) that correspond
to the characteristic band gaps of MoS2.41

Electrochemical Characterization of Different
Phases of Electrodes
The electrochemical behaviors of ePAD,
MoS2NS/ePAD,
ssDNA/MoS2NS/ePAD, and dsDNA/MoS2NS/ePAD electrodes
were detected using cyclic voltammetry (CV) in sodium phosphate buffer
(0.1 M, pH = 7.4) consisting of MB solution by potential sweeping
between −1.0 to + 1.0 V at a voltage scanning rate of 100 mV
s–1. The bare ePAD showed a small anodic peak current
of 0.43 μA (Figure 3a). The anodic peak current of MoS2NS/ePAD electrodes
increased to 6.2 μA (Figure 3a), which was assigned to the large surface area, enhanced
transfer rate of electron, and redox activity of MB at an electrode/electrolyte
interface, which is attributed to a unique electron transfer kinetic
property of MoS2 nanosheets. MoS2NS has the
capability to adsorb ssDNA with the help of various interactions,
dominantly using van der Waals force for adsorption. The peak anodic
current at ssDNA/MoS2NS/ePAD was 5.5 μA, which is
higher than the bare and lower than the nanosheet-modified electrode
(Figure 3a). When target
DNA (20 nM) was introduced, there was further decrease in the current
to 4.8 μA (Figure 3a) due to the MB intercalation between the DNA strands that confirmed
the presence of complimentary DNA strands. The aforementioned CV results
were in lined with the DPV analysis as depicted in Figure 3a,b.

Figure 3 (a) Cyclic voltammograms
(CVs) and (b) differential pulse voltammograms
(DPVs) of bare ePAD, MoS2NS/ePAD, ssDNA/MoS2NS/ePAD, and dsDNA/MoS2NS/ePAD at a scan rate of 100 mV
s–1 in 0.1 M SPB (pH = 7.4).

Various parameters related to ePAD were optimized such as the scan
rate, pH, immobilization time, and probe concentrations to attain
the maximum current signal. CVs of ssDNA/MoS2NS/ePAD were
recorded at the scan rates from 20 to100 mV s–1.
It is detected that the peak current was enhanced with increasing
scan rate, which confirmed the stability of the electrode (Figure 4a–c). Figure 4b shows the variation
of peak interfacial current with a square root of the scanning rate,
which confirmed that the interfacial kinetics was diffusion controlled. Figure 4c shows the plot
of log(I) versus log(V), and the
linear dependence confirmed that the process is diffusion controlled
with an R2 of 0.98. A range of pH (6.4–8.0)
was also optimized as shown in Figure 4d. MB is a basic dye and tends to form a cationic group
at physiological pH, while DNA is a negatively charged molecule due
to the phosphate group. Therefore, there will be more absorption of
MB ions, which leads to the maximum sensing response at pH 7.4.

performed in the presence of MB (1 μM) in sodium phosphate buffer
(0.1 M, pH 7.4).

Calculation of Electroactive
Surface Area for Modified ePAD
Calculation of the electroactive
surface area of the ePAD is to
depict the performance of the working region of the sensor. This working
area can be determined from the slope of Ipa versus v1/2 as per the Randles–Sevick equation25  where, Ipa is the peak anodic current, n is the electrons transferred (n = 2), v is the scan rate, D is the diffusivity
of MB (D = 5 × 10–10 m2 s–1),25A is the electroactive surface area (m2), and C is the concentration of the methylene blue solution.19,25

The electroactive area of MoS2NS-coated ePAD was
calculated to be 10 times more than bare ePAD.

Different concentrations
of ssDNA were immobilized onto the surface
of MoS2NS/ePAD to obtain the maximum sensing signal. A
CV graph depicted that the interfacial current decayed with increased
probe concentrations because of more organic layers of nucleic acid,
which may hinders the flow of electrons. Hence, 20 μM was chosen
as the optimum probe DNA concentration (Figure 5a). The electrochemical performance of the
incubated electrodes with probe DNA was checked at intervals of 1
h and 40 min, 2 h and 40 min, and 3 h and 40 min. The sensor response
was decreased at 2 h and 40 min as well as 3 h and 40 min because
the active sites of MB were occupied by the ssDNA. Thus, the sufficient
immobilization occurred at 1 h and 40 min, and further increasing
the time of immobilization caused a decrease in the current response.
Thus, the ssDNA was immobilized onto MoS2/ePAD for 1 h
40 min in further experiments are shown in Figure 5b.

Figure 5 (a) Optimization of ssDNA concentrations by
cyclic voltammograms
(20, 60, 80, and 100 μM) at MoS2NS/ePAD. (b) Optimization
of ssDNA immobilization times (1 h and 40 min, 2 h and 40 min, and

the (1 μM) MB in sodium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4) at
100mV s–1 in the potential range from −0.1
to +0.1 V.

Electrochemical Sensing
of Target DNA with ssDNA/MOS2NS/ePAD
The electrochemical
response of the ssDNA/MoS2NS/ePAD electrode was studied
as a function of a complementary
target DNA concentration against Salmonella using
the CV technique (Figure 6a,b). During this experiment, various target DNA concentrations
(100–20 nM) in MB (pH 7.4) were added to the functionalized
working region of ePAD. The current response decayed linearly with
an increase in target DNA concentrations. A similar trend was observed
in previous studies, which reported the decay of current as a function
of target DNA levels.30 This decrease in
current is attributed to the generation of hybrid duplexes, which
prevents the MB-ssDNA interaction. After hybridization of target DNA
with ssDNA, the number of unpaired nitrogenous bases gets reduced
due to base pairing of DNA strands by hydrogen bonding, which leads
to weak interaction of MB molecules. Hence, there is a decrease in
the anodic current as depicted from the CV curve. Figure 6b shows the sensor calibration
graph of current as a function of complementary target DNA concentrations.
The variation of interfacial current was linear with the target DNA
concentrations (100–20 nM), and the relationship was given
by the R2 value, which is equivalent to
0.991.

target DNA concentrations ranging from 100–20 nM. (b) Sensor
calibration at different concentrations of the target DNA (100–20
nM) in the scanning potential range from −1.0 to +1.0 V at
100 mV s–1 in sodium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH
7.4, 1 μM MB).

Sensor Selectivity, Reproducibility,
and Reliability
To explore the selectivity, reproducibility,
and reliability of the
fabricated sensor, the analyses were performed under the same conditions.
The experiment was carried out using ssDNA/MoS2NS/ePAD
with the noncomplementary and a three base pair mismatch sequence.
After hybridization of the ssDNA/MoS2NS/ePAD with the noncomplementary
DNA and three base pair mismatch sequence, an insignificant difference
in the sensing response was observed as compared to the probe DNA-modified
electrode. However, as soon as the fabricated sensor was introduced
to the specific target DNA, the current decreased significantly. Such
a response of the fabricated sensor showed that the above ePAD was
highly specific for Salmonella DNA (Figure 7a). To check the repeatability
of the fabricated genosensor, cyclic voltammograms of ssDNA/MoS2NS/ePAD were obtained 5 times under the same condition. Five
sets of the same electrodes were prepared with a fixed concentration
of ssDNA and incorporated for the sensing of target DNA. The fabricated
electrodes exhibited almost similar results that depicted the excellent
reproducibility of the DNA-based biosensor (Figure 7b).

DNA, and three base pair mismatch sequence (target DNA 3′-CTACTCGATACTACGGCT-5′).
(b) Different electrodes with fixed concentrations of target DNA (100
nM). All the experiments were carried out in 0.1 M sodium phosphate
buffer and 0.1 μM MB.

Conclusions
A paper-based genosensor for the sensing of Salmonella-specific DNA is demonstrated on the ssDNA/MoS2NS/ePAD-modified
electrode. The proposed genosensor showed higher sensitivity and specificity
toward Salmonella-specific DNA, and enhanced electrochemical
properties of 2D nanomaterials was also observed, thereby indicating
a limit of detection of 20 nM. Furthermore, present methodology reduced
the sample and analysis volume. The LoP-based device genosensor proves
to be effective for the detection of Salmonella-specific
DNA.

Materials and Methods
Materials
All the reagents used
were of high purity
grade and utilized without treatments. Sodium molybdate dihydrate
(Na2MoO4·2H2O; 99% purity) was
purchased from Fisher Scientific. Thioacetamide (CH3CSNH2; 99% purity) and silicotungstic acid were purchased from
CDH (Central Drug House) Ltd. Chemicals should be handled carefully
to avoid the direct contact as they may cause various complications.The18-mer
synthetic oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA technologies
(IDT), India. The sequences are as follows:capturing probe: 5′-GATGAGTATTGATGCCGA-3′

target DNA: 3′-CTACTCATAACTACGGCT-5′



Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer was used to prepare
different
concentrations of oligonucleotides (tris-10 mM and pH 8.0, EDTA-1
mM). DNA strands of the inv A gene of Salmonella was
used as ssDNA in this work.18 Target DNA
was used along with MB, and 10 s was chosen as the hybridization time
for all experimental studies.

Apparatus and Methods
Differential pulse voltammetry
(DPV) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) were carried out using the potentiostat/galvanostat
(Autolab model: AUT83785). The ePADs, fabricated by screen printing,
are based on a conventional two-electrode setup. The microstructural
characterizations were performed by using XRD (SmartLab guidance,
Rigaku) for the identification of the phase and crystallanity. HR-TEM
(Technai, FEI) was done for the identification of morphology. UV–vis
spectroscopy (Cary series, Agilent Technology) was utilized to determine
the band gap. Raman spectroscopy (HR800 JY, LabRAM HR) was performed
to determine the number of layers that correspond to the peak difference
in MoS2.

Synthesis of MoS2 Nanosheets
For the synthesis
of MoS2 nanosheets, sodium molybdate dihydrate (Na2MoO4·2H2O; 3 mM) and thioacetamide
(CH3CSNH2; 9 mM) were dissolved in 50 mL of
distilled water, and then silicotungstic acid (2.8 mM) was allowed
to mix under constant stirring. The final solution mixture was transferred
to a 100 mL teflon-lined autoclave and kept at 220 °C for ∼24
h. Consequently, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature. The
obtained products were filtered and then washed continuously with
distilled water, ethanol, and NaOH (1 M) and further dried in vacuum
at 50 °C for 6 h.

Fabrication of ePAD Integrated with MoS2 and ssDNA
Designing the method of the ePAD platform
mainly relies on low-cost
materials such as cellulose paper, conductive carbon ink, and solid
wax to create the electrode and hydrophobic barrier. Conductive ink
was employed to fabricate the ePAD to create a two-system electrode
on the cellulose-based substrate: counter and working electrodes.
A solid wax was grafted on the ePAD surface to illustrate the complete
hydrophobic barrier (using a hot plate at 150 °C). The ePAD consists
of one circular region: the immobilization area on which biomolecule
and 2D MoS2NS was immobilized. This region is separated
by printing patterns of solid wax: a hydrophobic stopping barrier,
which prevents overflowing of reagents into the electrochemical readout
cell, whereas otherwise, electrodes fouling would occur. Different
paper-based electrodes were designed for various studies, and the
conductivities of the prepared electrodes and were also checked by
a multimeter to confirm that electrodes were of samilar resistance.

To obtain signal amplification along with a fast detection, MoS2 was used as a biointerface. As a signal transducer, interaction
of methylene blue (MB) with DNA was exploited. The MB showed differential
interaction with ssDNA and dsDNA. The signal recorded at the ePAD
coated with ssDNA/MoS2NS was due to the difference in the
redox activity of MB. MB shows interaction with the free guanine bases
of ssDNA-modified electrode that enhances the current signal. In case
of hybridization with target DNA, MB molecules intercalate between
the base pairs of the hybrid due to which the current response decreases.
Such a phenomena can be ascribed to the steric hindrance of the reducing
groups of MB, which gets stacked-up between the bulky double helix
structure of the hybrid.17,42,43 The obtained peak current was evaluated for the data analysis, as
it depends on the MB interactions with DNA. The interactions of MB
with dsDNA and ssDNA were probed by means of DPV and CV in the MB
(1 μM) in sodium phosphate buffer (0.1 M; pH 7.4) at a scan
rate of 100 mV s–1 from −1.0 to +1.0 V (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Schematic Representation
of Fabrication of Paper-Based Electrode
ePAD Chip Calibration
Each step such as the synthesis
of MoS2 nanosheet (MoS2NS), probe concentration
(ssDNA specific to Salmonella sp.), and analytical
parameters such as the scan rate, pH, and time were optimized for
ePAD measurements. First, the circular region/immobilization area
was first decorated with MoS2NS. Afterwards, the ssDNA
specific to Salmonella was immobilized onto the circular
surface of the working electrode (WE). Finally, the electrochemical
readout of the assay was performed. Different concentrations of target
DNA were applied to the circular area of the modified electrode (ssDNA/MoS2NS/ePAD). The hybridization of target DNA with immobilized
ssDNA was performed by subjecting various concentrations of the target
molecule (100–20 nM) into 1 μM MB in sodium phosphate
buffer (0.1 M; pH 7.4) at 100 mV s–1 in the potential
ranges from −1.0 to +1.0 V. Electrochemical studies such as
CV and DPV were performed to confirm the hybridization between the
ssDNA and target DNA. Different electrodes having optimized concentrations
of ssDNA over MoS2NS/ePAD were prepared and incubated for
different intervals of time (1 h and 40 min, 2 h and 40 min, and 3
h and 40 min).The same protocol as above is applied at Salmonella ssDNA/MoS2NS/ePAD for hybridization reactions of probes
with noncomplementary and mismatch sequences, which were used instead
of the target sequence.44
