In this work, we unravel the photodynamics
of Nile Red (NR)
interacting with Al–ITQ-HB nanostructure, a new layer-type
metal–organic framework (MOF) with potential catalytic and
photonic applications. Steady-state spectroscopy reveals the presence
of NR monomers and aggregates when interacting with the MOF structure.
Time-resolved experiments provide emission lifetimes of the interacting
monomers, H- and J-type aggregates. We observed contributions from
two monomer populations having different environments. One monomer
species emits from the local-excited state and another from a photoproduced
charge-separated state resulting from an ultrafast intramolecular
charge transfer (ICT). Femtosecond fluorescence experiments reveal
that the ICT process occurs in ∼1 ps. Fluorescence microscopy
on single crystals and agglomerates of the composites shows a homogenous
distribution of the dye lifetimes within the material. This study
shows that the photobehavior of NR in Al–ITQ-HB MOF is dictated
by its location within the material. The reported findings using a
well-known polarity probe and a new two-dimensional MOF provide information
on the microenvironment of this material, which may help for designing
smart MOFs with potential applications in photonics and nanocatalysis.

1 Introduction
One
of the interests of the scientific community is currently focused
on the development and understanding of new porous materials because
of new challenges faced by the modern society.1−4 Metal–organic frameworks
(MOFs) are becoming one of the most promising porous materials because
of their wide range of applications5 in
gas storage and separation,6−10 catalysis,11,12 drug delivery,13 magnetic materials,14 and optoelectronic
devices.15 MOFs are formed by coordinative
bonding of multidentate ligands to metal atoms or metal clusters.
The resulting network has a large specific area that is distributed
among the surface, channels, and pores. The structures of these materials
are normally quite rigid, and weak interactions, such as H-bonding
or π–π stacking, may provide flexibility to the
system.16 These properties make three-dimensional
(3D) MOFs very suitable systems for encapsulating several molecules
and having potential applications.5−15 A special case of the MOF structure is the one based on sheet units,
which provides two-dimensional (2D) materials. These structures have
larger active surface areas and enable better diffusion of guest molecules.17−21 Recently, a novel mesostructured metal–organic-type material,
based on these ordered metal-cluster sheets (Al–ITQ-HB), has
been synthesized.22 The linker in this
structure is 4-heptylbenzoic acid (HB), which interacts with the aluminum
metal cluster through the carboxylic group forming stable coordination
bonds. The hydrocarbon tail acts as a spacer between the metal nodes,
inhibiting the 3D growth and promoting the formation of layers.23,24 The stability of this MOF in aqueous media and the diffusion of
molecules within its structure turns it into a promising material
for several applications, such as catalysis.22

Nile Red (NR) is a good candidate for studying the properties
of the MOF system because of its strong fluorescence and high sensitivity
to the properties (i.e. polarity and H-bonding) of the environment.24−28 It undergoes an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) reaction in
its first singlet excited state (S1) in tens of femtoseconds29−31 because of the presence of both amino and keto groups, which have
electrodonating and withdrawing characters, respectively. NR has been
largely used as a probe to study different environments.32−36 For example, steady-state studies have shown the presence of different
populations (as aggregates and monomers) of NR upon interaction with
silica-based materials (SBMs)37 such as
zeolites28,31 and MCM-41.29,30

Herein,
we report the results of studies on how the photobehavior
of NR is affected when it interacts with the Al–ITQ-HB MOF
(Scheme 1). Steady-state
UV–visible experiments demonstrate the presence of several
species. The emission of these populations is affected by the initial
dye concentrations in the composites. The shift of the emission to
longer wavelengths upon increasing the dye content suggests the formation
of aggregates. Time-resolved experiments show the contribution of
two differently located monomers and aggregates (J- and H-type), showing
that the photobehavior of NR is affected by its location within the
MOF. The femtosecond time-resolved emission experiments showed ultrafast
formation of a charge-separated (CS) state (∼1 ps), followed
by a vibrational cooling (VC) in ∼8 ps. The scanning confocal
fluorescence microscopy of single crystals and agglomerates of the
composite indicates that the dye is homogenously distributed within
the MOF. These results using a well-known polarity probe molecule
help in understanding the properties of this novel metal–organic
structure Al–ITQ-HB, which may lead to the development of new
material designs.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Steady-State
Observation of NR@Al–ITQ-HB
We studied the steady-state
behavior of NR@Al–ITQ-HB composites
in the solid state. The MOF exhibits a band at ∼250 nm and
a weak tail up to 600 nm (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Figure 1 shows the normalized UV–visible absorption and emission
spectra of the composites using different initial dye concentrations,
1 × 10–2, 1 × 10–3,
and 1 × 10–4 M (Figure S2, Supporting Information shows the nonnormalized UV–visible
absorption spectra). The most diluted sample (1 × 10–4 M) exhibits a broad and structureless diffuse reflectance (DR)
spectrum with an intensity maximum at 595 nm. The large width of the
band at the half maximum of the intensity indicates the presence of
several species of NR in the composites. The host material consists
of a layered structure in which the dye can be located and interact
with the units that form the framework. This suggests several possible
orientations and positions of NR molecules in the MOF as well as interactions
between them, resulting in several species. On the other hand, the
emission spectrum of the 1 × 10–4 M sample
excited at 470 nm shows a narrow band with a maximum at 645 nm. The
narrow emission spectrum contrasts the broad DT one, which is explained
in terms of the presence of different NR populations in the MOF that
are either nonemissive or weakly emissive and hence do not significantly
contribute to the emission spectrum at this excitation wavelength
(470 nm). To further understand the photobehavior of the composites,
we recorded the steady-state spectra of two samples with larger initial
dye concentrations: 1 × 10–3 and 1 × 10–2 M. The DR spectra show maxima at 611 and 618 nm,
respectively (Figure 1). The shapes of the bands of the two concentrations are very similar
but broader than that of the 1 × 10–4 M sample,
which reflects the formation of aggregates at higher dye contents.
The emission spectra of these two samples show a narrow band, exhibiting
the intensity maximum at 655 and 665 nm, respectively. The red shift
at increased concentrations supports the presence and emission of
NR aggregates within the composites. The full width at half maximum
(FWHM) of the emission bands are 2023, 2070, and 2125 cm–1 from the most diluted to the most concentrated sample, respectively.
The trend in increasing the FWHM with the dye concentration also reflects
the emission of additional species with significant contribution when
the NR concentration increases. Studies of NR in SBMs have reported
broader emission spectra and were explained in terms of enhanced contributions
from the trapped emissive species in the materials.29,31 Upon excitation at 470 nm, the emission of the three samples exhibits
a green band (∼525 nm) (Figure S3, Supporting Information). We anticipate that this emission corresponds
to the monomers, as we will show in the time-resolved emission spectra
(TRES) (see below). The fluorescence excitation spectra gating the
emission at 800 nm are well defined, with their intensity maxima at
∼610 nm (Figure S4, Supporting Information). Their shapes and maxima are similar to those of the DR spectra.
However, the FWHM of the excitation spectra is smaller than that of
the absorption ones, reflecting the presence of efficient nonradiative
deactivation pathways at the excited state of some species of trapped
NR molecules. Note that while  gating the emission at 525 nm,
we could not record an accurate excitation spectrum.

10–4 M (green lines), 1 × 10–3 M (orange lines), and 1 × 10–2 M (blue lines).
The emission spectra were recorded upon excitation at 550 nm.

2.2 Picosecond
Time-Resolved Fluorescence of NR@Al–ITQ-HB
2.2.1 Nile Red Concentration Effect
To
understand the photodynamics of the NR@Al–ITQ-HB composites,
we conducted time-resolved emission experiments with picosecond resolution. Figure 2 shows representative
emission decays of samples at three different initial dye concentrations
collected at different observation wavelengths (from 550 to 750 nm)
and excited at 470 nm. Table 1 gives the obtained time constants (τi),
the pre-exponential factors (ai), and
relative contributions (ci, normalized
to 100) from multiexponential global fits. For the sample having 1
× 10–4 M NR initial concentration, we observed
decay times of 0.71, 2.59, and 5.10 ns. The contribution of the shortest
lifetime (0.71 ns) decreases as the observation wavelength increases,
whereas the intermediate lifetime (∼2.6 ns) does not significantly
vary throughout the emission spectrum. The contribution of the longest
component (5.1 ns) increases with the observation wavelength. On the
basis of these results and considering the steady-state observation,
we assign the longest component to the emission lifetime of the monomers,
which undergo an ICT process to give a CS state. The emission lifetime
of the photoproduced CS monomer is comparable to that reported for
NR interacting with the SBMs (4.1 ns)30 and in a dichloromethane (DCM) solution (4.4 ns).28 We assign the intermediate component to NR aggregates interacting
with the Al–ITQ-HB structure. Several studies have revealed
that NR molecules easily form aggregates when encapsulated in restrictive
environments.30,38,39 For example, populations of both H- and J-type aggregates have been
observed for NR in different porous materials such as zeolites and
MCM-41.37 The mean emission lifetime of
the aggregates is ∼0.5 ns in NaY zeolites31 and ∼1.2 ns in MCM-41,30 which are significantly shorter than those observed in this composite
(2.5 ns). The longer value observed in this system suggests the presence
of different interactions between the dye species and the Al–ITQ-HB
framework. Finally, we assign the shortest component (∼0.7
ns), which has its largest contribution at the blue part of the emission
spectrum, to a monomer population that emits directly from the local-excited
(LE) state, different from the ones having suffered an ICT (5.1 ns).
Considering the structure of Al–ITQ-HB (Scheme 1), two different domains can be distinguished:
(1) the linker domain, where the heptyl chains provide a quite nonpolar
environment, and (2) another domain involving the aromatic and carboxylic
groups and the metal clusters, where hydroxyl or oxy groups might
be present, resulting in a higher polarity of the region. The occurrence
of the ICT process in the interacting NR to produce CS species depends
on the polar character of its local environment.27,40,41 The LE state is stabilized in apolar media,
increasing the energy barrier to the CS state and thus reducing the
probability of the ICT event.40−42 As a result, NR molecules in
apolar media have a high probability to emit from the initial LE state.
On the other hand, in polar environments, the energy barrier to reach
the CS state decreases, making possible the occurrence of the ICT
event and therefore, recording the emission signal from the photoproduced
CS species. We suggest that the ∼5 ns component reflects the
emission decay of those species. It has been reported that the ICT
process occurs in hundreds of femtoseconds,29−31 a time constant
shorter than the time resolution of our time-correlated single-photon
counting (TCSPC) technique (∼15 ps), and thus cannot be characterized.
Another possible origin of the shortest component can be attributed
to a NR population of weakly or nonemissive H-type aggregates. It
has been reported that these types of aggregates of NR molecules in
R-MCM41 have a lifetime of ∼0.3–0.4 ns.29 The maximum contribution of this component is in the shortest
wavelengths (suggesting an origin from the LE monomers). However,
its contribution is still large at longer wavelengths (H-aggregate
emission region). Thus, we suggest that the 0.7 ns component corresponds
to a combined contribution of both LE and H-aggregate populations.

To further
characterize the origin of the observed components,
we prepared composites with different initial dye concentrations and
studied their photobehaviors. Table 1 shows the values of the time constants obtained from
multiexponential fits of the decays of the samples, in addition to
the decay data discussed above. The lifetimes for the sample with
1 × 10–3 M dye are 0.36, 1.62, and 4.15 ns,
whereas those of the sample with 1 × 10–2 M
initial dye concentration are 0.26, 1.23, and 3.15 ns. The values
of the emission lifetimes decrease with the NR concentration, and
we explain it as a result of enhanced NR–NR interactions. The
shortest lifetime is 0.26 ns in the most concentrated sample (0.7
ns for the least concentrated one). Two observations can be made:
first, the lifetimes at higher initial NR concentrations are comparable
to those reported for H-aggregates in R-MCM-41 (0.3–0.4 ns).29 Second, the large difference between the value
of this time component (∼0.7 ns) in the most diluted sample
and the one (0.26 ns) at higher concentrations suggests that at lower
concentrations, the component arises mostly from LE monomers, whereas
at higher ones, it comes from the H-type aggregates. A similar trend
is observed for the other two lifetimes: the intermediate value, which
we previously assigned to J-aggregates, decreases from 2.59 to 1.23
ns, whereas the lifetime assigned to the CS state changes from 5.10
to 3.15 ns. The shortening in the lifetime values is explained in
terms of the interactions of neighboring NR species that provoke a
self-emission quenching as it has been shown when NR interacts within
other materials.29,30 The contribution of the longest
lifetime assigned to the CS monomer species decreases at larger NR
contents, as a result of aggregate formation.

2.2.2 Time-Resolved Emission Spectra
To further elucidate
the composite photodynamics and to interrogate
the different NR species present in this MOF, we recorded the TRES
of the most concentrated sample at different excitation wavelengths. Figure 3 shows the TRES of
samples that are nonnormalized and normalized to the maximum of emission
intensities. Exciting at 470 nm results in a band with a maximum at
∼550 nm and a second one at ∼650 nm. The greenest band
decays, reaching its half-maximum of intensity between 500 and 700
ps, which, following the results obtained from the analysis of the
emission decays, corresponds to the combined emission of LE monomers
and H-aggregates. The second band is a combination of the emissions
of the CS monomer and the J-aggregate populations. When the sample
is excited at 550 nm, the greenest band is not observed. The normalized
TRES indicates that at shorter gating times (100 ps to 1 ns), the
band is broader, but it becomes narrower at longer observation times.
This suggests that at short gating times, the emission comes from
several species. Furthermore, the maximum of this band shifts from
∼625 to 670 nm, which suggests that two overlapping bands contribute
to the emission spectrum. The spectral and TCSPC results indicate
that these two bands correspond to the CS monomer and J-aggregates.
The TRES of the composites were also collected upon excitation at
635 nm. These spectra correspond to the aggregates as the monomers
do not absorb at this wavelength of excitation. The TRES show a band
with a maximum at ∼665 nm and not changing with time, suggesting
that it mainly corresponds to the emission of J-aggregates. To study
the presence of possible processes and the relations between the excited
species of the system, we also constructed time-resolved area-normalized
emission spectra (TRANES).43Figure 4 shows the TRANES of the most
concentrated sample upon a 470 nm excitation. The isoemissive point
at 625 nm confirms an excited-state process bridging the species that
emit at 550 and 650 nm. As explained earlier, NR monomers can undergo
ICT from the LE state (550 nm band) to give the CS state which emits
at wavelengths longer than 650 nm. Time-resolved studies have reported
that this process occurs in tens to hundreds of femtoseconds.29,31

2.3 Femtosecond Time-Resolved Fluorescence of
NR@Al–ITQ-HB
To further elucidate the photodynamics
of NR@Al–ITQ-HB, we recorded the fluorescence signal of the
most concentrated sample in the solid state using femtosecond resolution. Figure 5 shows the emission
transients of the sample at representative observation wavelengths
upon excitation at 470 nm. Table 2 shows the time constants (τi) and
their contributions (ai, normalized to
100) to the signal after a multiexponential fit. The transients are
composed of three components, each with different time constant: ∼1,
∼8.2, and 260 ps. The 260 ps component was fixed in the fit
using the values obtained from the ps emission decays. The intermediate
one, with a time of ∼8.2 ps, is present at all the observation
wavelengths. This component is assigned to VC of NR. The time constant
of the VC of NR in SBMs was reported to be ∼2–3 ps.29−31 The large difference in the values of this component can be explained
by the presence of hydroxyl groups in SBMs that interact with NR via
H-bonds, favoring vibrational energy transfer from excited NR molecules
to the surrounding environment. In the present composites, the NR@Al–ITQ-HB
complexes are formed through weaker, nonspecific interactions that,
combined with the confinement effect caused by the laminar MOF structure,
result in slower excess energy dissipation. Finally, the shortest
component (∼1 ps) is present at 600 nm (higher energy of the
emission spectrum), and its signal is rising at 625 nm. Figure S5
(Supporting Information) shows the presence
of this rise in the component when observing at 675 nm. This decay
at short wavelengths and rise at longer ones suggest a common origin
of the process associated with this component. NR in solution and
encapsulated within SBM undergoes ultrafast ICT from its amino group
to its oxo one. This event occurs in ∼1 ps in DCM solution,
and it is favored in polar media.26 Upon
encapsulation in SBM, the NR ICT reaction becomes faster, exhibiting
a time constant of hundreds of fs.30,31,39 The relatively long time observed here (∼1
ps), associated with ICT in NR@Al–ITQ-HB, might reflect that
NR molecules undergoing ICT are located in a more apolar environment.
The similar values of the ICT time constant in both DCM and this MOF
suggest that the polarities of the two media are not very different.

2.4 Scanning Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy
of NR@Al–ITQ-HB
To further characterize the photobehavior
of the composites, we used fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy
(FLIM). NR@Al–ITQ-HB crystals of different sizes were selected
under the microscope and studied. The fluorescence decays were measured
upon a 470 nm excitation and collected in two spectral regions: 590–640
and 645–800 nm. To begin with, Figure 6A shows the emission decays of single crystals
(less than 0.5 μm in diameter), and the inset exhibits the corresponding
FLIM image. Table 3 gives the time constants (τi) and the pre-exponential
factors (ai, normalized to 100) obtained
from multiexponential global fits of the emission decays of single-crystals,
as well as the values obtained for agglomerates (multiple crystals
joined) under the same experimental conditions. The biexponential
fits give lifetimes of 1.53 and 3.60 ns for single crystal observations.
The two components are assigned to the emissions of J-aggregates and
monomers, respectively, as the lifetime values are comparable to the
ones (1.23 and 3.15 ns, respectively) obtained in the previous TCSPC
experiments using the ensemble solid composites. The component contribution
depends on the observed spectral region, with the shortest being the
one that contributes the most to the blue side of the spectrum. Figure 6B shows a comparison
between the fluorescence emission decays from single crystals and
those from the agglomerates under the microscope. We observe the same
decay behavior for both systems; therefore, we can consider that NR
is not affected by intercrystal interactions. It should be noted that
the shortest component observed in the ensemble solid is not seen
in these decays. This can be explained by the longer time resolution
(∼300 ps) of the microscope setup, compared to the TCSPC system
(∼70 ps). Figure 6C shows a comparison between the emission spectra of many single
crystals and agglomerates and the ensemble solid one. Whereas the
latter displays a unique band with a maximum at 665 nm, single crystal
and agglomerate spectra show two maxima of equal intensity, at 637
nm and 663 nm. The emission spectra of single and many crystals indicate
that different emitting species of NR are present within this MOF.
The region of ∼575 nm shows a clear variation in the intensity
which does not depend on the size or agglomeration of the measured
crystal. However, we can observe a difference in the intensities in
this region when comparing with the ensemble solid spectrum. This
fact can be explained by the absorption of the crystal emission by
a neighboring crystal in the ensemble solid because of the significant
spectral overlap between the absorption and emission bands.

3 Conclusions
In this
work, we have presented studies of the photoproperties
of a novel composite formed by an MOF-type material, Al–ITQ-HB,
and NR using steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopies. The composites
contain several NR populations whose contributions in the emission
signal are affected by the initial dye concentration used to make
the complexes. The different species are assigned to J- and H-type
aggregates and monomers. The parts that form the Al–ITQ-HB
framework, linkers and metal clusters, provide environments that are
sufficiently different to affect the NR dynamics. We identify two
types of NR monomers: one that emits from the LE state (∼0.7
ns) and another one showing an ICT process to give a CS state that
has a lifetime of ∼5 ns. Femtosecond experiments unravel the
formation of the CS state in ∼1 ps. The VC of the trapped species
occurs in ∼8.2 ps. These processes are significantly longer
than those observed for NR when it interacts with SBMs. The less polar
character of the MOF and the weak interactions that the layered structure
provides affect the observed behavior. Finally, FLIM studies on single
crystals and agglomerates reveal a homogenous distribution of lifetimes
within the composites. The increment in the intensity of the green
part of the emission spectra measured under the microscope comparing
with the ensemble solid one reveals self-absorption of the emission
from the latter.

These findings demonstrate that the different
environments in the
Al–ITQ-HB structure affect the behavior of this classical molecular
probe interacting with the framework. The results will aid in the
design of materials for different nanomaterial applications.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis of the NR@M-ITQ
MOFs
The
material was prepared according to the procedures reported in the
bibliography.22 Briefly, Al–ITQ-HB
was synthesized from equimolar quantities of AlCl3·6H2O (3.1 mmol) and 4-heptylbenzoic acid (3.1 mmol), which had
each been dissolved in 15 mL of dimethylformamide. The two solutions
were mixed, and the resulting slurry was introduced into a stainless-steel
autoclave and heated at 150 °C for 24 h under autogenous pressure
and static conditions. Once cooled to room temperature, the solution
was filtered with distilled water. The sample was activated in methanol
for 24 h to efficiently remove the unreacted linker and solvent molecules.
The material was then isolated and dried under vacuum at room temperature.
Its structure was observed through transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) micrographs (Figure S6, Supporting Information), which were obtained with a JEOL JEM2100F electron microscope operating
at 200 keV. The samples were prepared directly by dispersing the powders
onto carbon copper grids. The dye NR (Sigma-Aldrich, purity >98.0%)
was incorporated into the material for spectroscopic studies. First,
dichloromethane solutions of the dye with specific molar concentrations
(1 × 10–2, 1 × 10–3,
and 1 × 10–4 M) were prepared. Then, 50 mg
of the MOF was added to 1 mL of the dye solution, and the mixture
was stirred for 24 h at room temperature. The material was washed
several times until no trace of NR was observed in the UV–visible
absorption spectra of the supernatant. Finally, the material was dried
to eliminate the solvent. The loadings obtained from the supernatant
absorption measurements were 1.8 × 1018, 2.3 ×
1017, and 3.2 × 1016 NR molecules/gMOF for 1 × 10–2, 1 × 10–3, and 1 × 10–4 M initial dye concentrations,
respectively.

4.2 Structural, Spectroscopic,
and Dynamics Measurements
Steady-state UV–visible
absorption and fluorescence measurements
were conducted using JASCO V-670 and FluoroMax-4 (Jobin-Yvon) spectrophotometers,
respectively. The diffuse reflectance spectra were measured using
a 60 mm integrating sphere (ISN-723) and corrected with the Kubelka–Munk
function. Picosecond time-resolved emission experiments were recorded
employing a TSCPC system.44 The samples
were excited by 40 ps pulsed (∼1 mW, 40 MHz repetition rate)
diode lasers (PicoQuant) centered at 470, 550, and 635 nm. The instrument
response function (IRF) of the diode laser was approximately 70 ps
wide. The fluorescence signal was collected at the magic angle (54.71°)
and monitored from 90° from the excitation beam at discrete emission
wavelengths. The decays were deconvoluted and fitted to a multiexponential
function using the FLUOFIT package (PicoQuant), which allowed single
and global fits. The quality of the fits as well as the number of
exponentials were carefully selected based on the reduced χ2 values (which were always below <1.2) and the distributions
of the residuals. All of the experiments were performed at room temperature
(295 K). Femtosecond time-resolved emission decays were collected
using a fluorescence upconversion technique in the solid state with
a reflection mode disposition of the system. The setup of the equipment
and a detailed description of the system is explained in the Supporting Information (Figure S7). Briefly,
the sample was excited at 470 nm and recorded at different observation
wavelengths. To analyze the fs-transients, we deconvoluted a multiexponential
function with the IRF to fit the experimental data. The errors for
the calculated time components were smaller than 15% in all cases.
The confocal microscopy measurements were performed on a MicroTime
200 confocal microscope (PicoQuant). The excitation was conducted
with the same diode laser used in the TSCPC experiment. The emission
signal was collected using a 520 nm long pass filter (Chroma). In
brief, the instrument consists of an inverse Olympus IX 71 microscope
equipped with a water-immersion objective (×60 NA1.2, Olympus)
and a 2D piezo scanner (Physik Instrumente). The emitted light was
then focused on a 50 μm pinhole and later collimated to two
independent single-photon avalanche photodiodes (Micro-Photon-Devices)
for the time-resolved measurements. The emission spectra were collected
through a Shamrock ST-303i (Andor Technology) imaging spectrograph
and detected by an Andor Newton EMCCD camera (Andor Technology). The
samples were measured in the solid state, which was prepared by spilling
a small amount of the solid powder over the coverslip and introducing
it into the sample holder. Fifteen single crystals and agglomerates
were analyzed.
