Boronic
acids (BAs) are a prominent functionality extensively used
to design biologically active compounds and functional biomaterials.
Boronic acids open shell can lead to unspecific reactivity of BAs
with endogenous nucleophiles and to undesired off-target effects.
Here, diazaborines are presented as a new class of boron-based warheads
for serine proteases inhibition, in which the boron function is stabilized
in the form of an aromatic boron-based heterocycle. In this study,
diazaborines were readily synthesized in a single step in yields up
to 96%, without any chromatographic operation and were shown to reversibly
inhibit human neutrophil elastase (HNE) serine protease with IC50 values in the low μM range. Diazaborines were also
selective toward HNE, as no inhibition was observed against a panel
of five closely related serine proteases. Synthetic and theoretical
studies performed on this system suggest that, similar to BAs, the
reaction mechanism involves the formation of a reversible covalent
bond between the diazaborine boron center and the catalytic serine
oxygen. Finally, different from BAs, diazaborines were shown to be
very stable in pH 7.4 phosphate buffer and human plasma.

Introduction
Serine proteases are
one of the largest and more important groups
of enzymes found in eukaryotes and prokaryotes that selectively catalyze
the hydrolysis of peptide bonds.1 Proteolysis
plays a key role in pathologies such as rheumatoid arthritis, bacterial
and viral infections, cancer, and Alzheimer’s disease.1 Therefore, the discovery of innovative protease
inhibitors stands as an invaluable tool for advanced therapeutic intervention.2 In the past, boronic acids (BAs) emerged as a
very promising class of serine protease inhibitors that readily form
a negatively charged tetravalent borate upon reaction with nucleophiles
at the enzyme active site (Scheme 1A).3 Rather surprisingly
and despite being extensively used, with the notable exception of
benzoxaboroles,4 this chemical warhead
periphery remained basically unaltered for more than 40 years.3 This lack of diversity reflects the intrinsic
chemical properties required for the interaction with the protein
active site. In detail, the carbon substituent is essential to improve
the recognition by the biologic target, while the boron open shell
confers Lewis acidity to BAs and enables the reversible covalent ligation
with the active site nucleophiles.3 However,
also because of this, BAs react unspecifically with other endogenous
molecules such as vicinal diols or proteins and this leads to unfavorable
pharmacokinetics. This reactive profile constitutes a major obstacle
in the development of boron-based therapeutics.5 Therefore, the discovery of a new BA scaffold that is generally
unreactive but retains the ability to form a reversible covalent bond
with oxygen-based nucleophiles at the protein active site is of fundamental
importance to discover the next generation of serine protease inhibitors.
On the basis of this, we anticipated that a strategy to overcome the
unspecific reactivity of BAs would be to embed this function in an
aromatic heterocycle where the boron vacant orbital may be stabilized
by the lone pair of electrons of an adjacent nitrogen atom.6 Careful tuning of this boron-based (B–N)
heterocycle stereo-electronic properties would not only contribute
to an improved stability but, more importantly, would offer a mechanism
to expose the BA at the enzyme active site, exploring the selective
disruption of the B=N bond catalyzed by the serine hydroxyl
group (Scheme 1B).6

Scheme 1 (A) Formation of a Negatively-Charged Tetrahedral
Boron Center upon
Reaction with a Serine at Enzyme Active Site; (B,C) Development of
a Stable B–N Heterocycle Capable of Selective Enzyme Recognition
In the early 80s, diazaborines
(Scheme 1C) emerged
as a promising class of antibacterial
agents that target enoyl reductase via formation of a covalent bond
between the nicotinamide ribose hydroxyl group and the boron atom.7 Encouraged by this mode of action, we initiated
a study to determine if this family B–N heterocycles could
also be used as a replacement of aromatic BAs in the design of serine
protease inhibitors.

Results and Discussion
To test this
hypothesis, we selected human neutrophil elastase
(HNE) which is an important serine protease identified as a potential
therapeutic target in several inflammatory diseases, and for which,
there is still no efficient inhibitor marketed.8 As shown in Scheme 2, following reported methodologies, diazaborines 1 and 2 were synthesized in excellent yields, simply
by combining in aqueous media, 2-carbonyl benzene BAs with hydrazine.9 Once prepared, we evaluated these heterocycles
as well as phenyl BA and benzoxoborole against HNE. Although phenyl
BA and benzoxoborole were inactive against HNE up to a concentration
of 100 μM, diazaborines 1 and 2 effectively
inhibited the enzyme with IC50 values of 24 and 48 μM,
respectively.

Scheme 2 Phenyl BA, Benzoxoborole, and Diazaborines 1 and 2 Evaluation against HNE
These results were further corroborated by in silico molecular
docking studies that posed the phenyl BA and the benzoxoborole at
the interface of the entrance for the primary recognition S1 pocket but at the opposite side to the catalytic serine. This positioning
suggests that these compounds can hardly establish a ligation with
the serine oxygen and support their inactivity. Differently, diazaborines 1 and 2 adopt a pose inside the HNE binding site
which allows a closer contact of the boron atom with the oxygen of
Ser195 (∼3.5 Å). As shown in Figure 1, both the distance and orientation of these
compounds support the formation of a B–OSer195 covalent
bond. This mechanism of action was further supported by covalent docking
calculations which showed that upon coordination with the oxygen of
Ser195, the boron adopts a tetrahedral geometry that promotes the
formation of important new interactions with Phe192, and Gly193, and
the blockage of the access to the catalytic serine.

poses of phenyl BA (A), benzoxoborole
(B), diazaborines 1 (C), and 2 (D), and
best covalent docking poses of diazaborines 1 (E) and 2 (F) compounds inside the HNE binding site.

Considering these promising results and taking
advantage of the
well-established and straightforward assemblage of diazaborines,9 we set out to explore the electronic and chemical
space of the boron center. With this objective, 2-carbonyl benzene
BAs were reacted with different hydrazines as shown in Scheme 3. The expected heterocycles
were all obtained in good yields in one step without any chromatographic
purification. In terms of HNE inhibition, the heterocycles prepared
with 2-acetyl-benzene BA were generally more active than diazaborines 3–5, assembled from 2-formyl-benzene BA. The use of
hydrazines featuring electron-withdrawing N-substituents also improved
the heterocycle activity up to an IC50 value of 11.7 μM
(compound 8, Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Modular Assembly of Diazaborines 3–8 (Benzene-BA
Series) and Inhibitory Activity against HNE
Docking studies performed on this series revealed that
the most
active molecules, 5 and 8, consistently
fit the heterocycle in the S1 subsite, while the N-substituents
are either flipped to the S2 or the S1′
subpockets in the noncovalent and covalent models, respectively (Figure 2). On the basis of
this, we anticipated that a smaller heterocycle would better fit the
S1 pocket and improve the overall affinity of the inhibitor.
On the basis of this rational, a series of thienyl diazaborines (9–16)7 were studied against
the HNE active site. Similarly, to the benzene-BA series (3–8), apart from compounds 10 and 14 that
fit the phenyl group inside the S1 subsite, all other diazaborines
pose the thienyl moiety inside the S1 cavity, the N-substituents
in the S2 subpocket and the boron atom at a distance between
3.4 and 4 Å of the serine oxygen. Upon the formation of the covalent
B–OSer195, the heterocycle pose is maintained, while
the N-substituent moves to the S1′ subpocket and
additional interactions are established with Cys42 and Phe192. According
to this model, the thienyl diazaborines exhibit slightly higher affinities
for the HNE active site than the benzene-BA series (scores between
44 and 52), probably because of an extra interaction that the thienyl
moiety (S atom) is able to establish with Ser195 nitrogen.

docking poses of diazaborines 8 (A)
and 12 (B) and best covalent docking poses of diazaborines 8 (C) and 12 (D) compounds inside the HNE binding
site.

Taking these results in consideration,
we performed the synthesis
of diazaborines 9–16 and evaluated their inhibitory
potential against HNE. As shown in Scheme 4, these compounds elicited higher potency
than the previous diazaborines (3–8), and heterocycle 12 featuring the N-p-toluenesulfonyl
substituent became the most active molecule with an IC50 of 3.4 μM. The inhibitory kinetic profile of 12 was studied using the progress curve method under pseudo-first order
conditions (Supporting Information, Figure
S4). Under these conditions, diazaborine 12 displayed
a time-dependent inhibition of HNE and a second-order rate constant, kon, of 2.68 M–1 s–1. This value, albeit modest when compared to large peptidomimetic-based
inhibitors,10 combined with a ligand efficiency
(LE) value of 0.39 and a ligand-lipophilicity efficiency (LLE) value
of 3.4, suggests that diazaborines are a good starting point for further
medicinal chemistry optimization.11,12

Scheme 4 Modular
Assembly of Diazaborines 9–16 (Thienyl-BA
Series) and Activity against HNE
Diazaborines are often regarded as stable heterocycles,
though
the B–N bond is potentially reversible, namely, when the nitrogen
is substituted with electron-withdrawing groups.13 Therefore, we questioned if the observed activity of compound 12 could be due to the in situ hydrolysis of the B–N
bond. To study this, the thienyl BA hydrazone 17 was
prepared and tested against HNE. As shown in Scheme 4, the BA hydrazone 17 (IC50 = 12.0 μM) was able to inhibit the enzyme, with only
slightly less efficiency than the corresponding diazaborine 12 (IC50 = 3.4 μM) but with a significantly
higher second-order rate constant (216 vs 2.86 M–1 s–1). To rationalize this difference, we docked
both molecules against the enzyme active site. As shown in Figure 3, compound 17 shows a completely different binding pose inside HNE active
site. While compound 12 fits the thienyl core deep inside
the S1 cavity and accommodates the tosyl group in the S1′, compound 17 rotates the tosyl group
to S2 cavity, losing the interactions with Cys42, but establishing
a π–π stacking interaction with His57.

docking poses of diazaborines 12 (A)
and 17 (B) compounds inside the HNE binding site.

Once we established diazaborines
as a valuable scaffold to design
HNE inhibitors, we access their potency, selectivity, and chemical
stability against open shell BAs. With this objective, diazaborine 18 and the oxime BA 19 that is unable to form
a six-member heterocycle, were prepared and tested against HNE. Very
gratifyingly, both compounds exhibited similar potencies (18 IC50 = 2.7 μM vs 19 IC50 = 0.7 μM) but significantly different second-order rate constants
(18kon = 12.8 M–1 s–1 vs 19kon = 97.0 M–1 s–1). The
docking calculations performed on these systems revealed that when
covalently bounded to HNE, these compounds place the thienyl moiety
inside the S1 cavity and place the benzyl moiety either
in the S1′ (18) or in the S2 cavities (19). The affinity of compound 19 for HNE is slightly better than the affinity of diazaborine 18 (scores 53.9 vs 51.3), and this is probably a result of
an extra interaction with Phe215 in the S2 subpocket. Overall,
both compounds (18 and 19) show a good spatial
fitting of the binding pocket, however, occupying perpendicular subpockets
(S1′ and S2) (Figure 4).

Figure 4 HNE inhibition data and cytotoxicity for diazaborines 18 and 19 and best covalent docking poses of
diazaborines 18 (A) and 19 (B) compounds
inside the HNE binding
site.

Regarding the selectivity, 18 and 19 were
tested against a panel of closely related serine proteases (Supporting Information, Table S1). In this assay,
at a concentration of 100 μM, both the diazaborine and oxime
BA were proven to be inactive toward urokinase, trypsin, thrombin,
kallikrein, and chymotrypsin. Similarly, in a standard cytotoxicity
assay using a human cell line HEK 293T (Supporting Information, Table S2), these compounds did not induce any
appreciable toxicity even after a 48 h exposure period and up to a
concentration of 100 μM.

Finally, we addressed the chemical
stability of both compounds
in biocompatible conditions. BAs are well-known for binding carbohydrates;
therefore, compounds 18 and 19 were incubated
with 1 equiv of fructose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH
7.4. As shown in Figure 5, under these conditions, the open-shell BA 19 exhibits
a half-life of 2 h, while the diazaborine remained mostly intact over
a 24 h period, which is in agreement with earlier reports that thienyl
groups display a good chemical stability.14 Encouraged by these results and aiming to establish the stability
of the diazaborine in a more complex system, compound 18 was incubated in human plasma at 37 °C (400 μM) for 10
h. The concentration was monitored by high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC), and over this time, no degradation of the diazaborine was
detected, which supports the initial hypothesis that the formation
of the B–N heterocycle improves the BA stability, while maintaining
a mechanism for the interaction with enzyme nucleophiles.

Conclusions
In summary, here, we disclosed the use of diazaborines
as serine
protease inhibitors and demonstrate that this class of compounds can
be effectively used as BA replacements, eliciting similar potencies
and selectivities but improved stabilities in complex mediums. In
detail, a series of diazaborines were prepared in a simple step without
chromatographic purifications (yields 49–97%) and were shown
to inhibit HNE reversibly in the low micromolar range. Alcoholysis
of diazaborines, used here as a model for the reaction with the catalytic
serine residue, led to the rapid and quantitative formation of the
corresponding boronate ester, thus strongly suggesting that diazaborines
are covalent inhibitors of HNE (Figure S1). Furthermore, docking studies performed on this system support
the interaction of diazaborines with the HNE binding site via the
occupancy of the S1 subsite and the formation of a covalent
B–OSer195 bond. A direct comparison between diazaborine 18 and its open-shell BA counterpart, 19, revealed
that both compounds inhibited the enzyme with similar potencies, though
both exhibit very distinct stability profiles in favor of the diazaborine
that was stable in human plasma over a 10 h period. Additional evidence
for the unique features displayed by diazaborines as enzyme inhibitors
comes from the observation that BAs 17 and 19 are equipotent but significantly less reactive toward HNE than their
cyclic counterparts 12 and 18. This is consistent
with their lower dissociation rate constants, koff, and thus they have longer residence times than their BA
counterparts.15−17 These results, combined with appropriate LE and LLE
values, highlight the potential of diazaborines as excellent starting
points to develop selective HNE inhibitors.
