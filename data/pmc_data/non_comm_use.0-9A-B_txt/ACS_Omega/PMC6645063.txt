Stable, catalytically active palladium
nanoparticles of various
average diameters (1.9–7.4 nm) have been synthesized and characterized
by X-ray diffraction, spectroscopy, and microscopy techniques to demonstrate
remarkable size-dependent and renewed catalytic activity toward the
Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reaction in green protocol. The catalytic
activity is found to depend on the amount of the reducing agent, stabilizer–precursor
ratio, solvent composition, and aryl halides used. The product obtained
by this reaction is characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and IR spectroscopy analyses. A newly developed kinetic equation
illustrates that while the catalyst particles of the lowest dimension
are gradually exposed to the reactants and hence activated due to
partial removal of capping polymer from the catalyst surface, others
are deactivated due to agglomeration during the progress of the reaction,
as conformed by the microscopic profiles of the used and unused catalysts.

Introduction
Nanoparticles
play tremendous roles in various fields because of
their large surface-to-volume ratio, more energized surface molecules,
electron confining ability, capability of tuning the properties of
material, providing bridge between bulk material and single molecules,
etc.1−4 On the other hand, transition metals are used as catalysts in a
large number of organic reactions, including the carbon–carbon
(C–C) coupling reaction using metals like Cu, Cr, Co, Pd, Ni,
etc.5−7 Among these, Pd is special and found to be the metal of the most
comprehensive use.

Among different C–C coupling reactions,
Suzuki–Miyaura
is an efficient one8−18 because handling and removal of reagents and products are easy compared
to those of the corresponding compounds in organometallic reactions.19−22 Moreover, the reaction is not affected by the number of functional
groups present in aryl halides or arylboronic acids. Pd-catalyzed
C–C and carbon–heteroatom coupling reactions are performed
mostly by expensive, toxic, and air-sensitive P- and/or N-donating
ligands like tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0), tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0)
in organic solvents, and poly(2-oxazoline) palladium carbine complex
in water or by in situ reduction of Pd(II) complexes.23−29 The separation of products from these catalysts is very difficult,
which seems to be the major drawback of the method. So, ligand-free
and loosely bound nanocatalysts are the focus of this study because
these can work in a very small amount at moderate temperature, are
easily achievable, and powerful enough to show activity in “green”
experimental conditions, as well as in water and aerated solutions.30−35 In fact, despite routine use of nonaqueous solvents in many organic
syntheses, the most abundant, versatile, nontoxic solvent water is
now regaining importance for economic, environmental, and safety concerns.36−42

The last 2 decades have witnessed extensive use of homogeneous
Pd catalysts because of their higher activity and selectivity.43−46 But considering the contamination of ligand and Pd metal in the
products, as well as tedious separation and recycling involved in
homogeneous catalysis in large scale and industrial syntheses, microheterogeneous
catalysis especially by nanoparticles is now favored.47−50 In previous studies,51,52 we observed that strong ligands
provide small but catalytically less active nanoparticles, since these
ligands cover the nanoparticle surface almost entirely preventing
any reactant molecules to approach. Conversely, linear polymers like
poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), poly(vinylpyrrolidone), sodium polyacrylate,
etc. can control the shapes and sizes of the nanoparticles, without
affecting their inherent catalytic activity.53,54 Reportedly, PVA is mainly a steric stabilizer of nanoparticles,
although it weakly interacts with metal nanoparticles by its functional
group and covers the surface of nanoparticles like ligands. Moreover,
polymer-stabilized lyophilic metal nanoparticles can be uniformly
dispersed with reactants and products in solvents resembling a homogeneous
catalytic system.55

Our aim here
is to study the Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reaction
by using a very low content of synthesized palladium nanoparticles
of various diameters under green protocol and also to determine the
size-dependent catalytic activity and change of the PVA-protected
synthesized nanocatalysts during the progress of the reaction.56

Results and Discussion
X-ray Powder Diffraction
(PXRD) Analysis
The X-ray
powder diffraction (PXRD) (Bruker AXS D8-Advance instrument) pattern
of Pd nanoparticles of catalyst-A is shown in Figure 1. Only two characteristic peaks of carbon-loaded
palladium are marked at the 2θ values of 40.01 and 68.06°
corresponding to (111) and (220) planes of face-centered cubic (FCC)
crystal of Pd (JCPDS FN: PDF#870637). Moreover, two characteristics
peaks of graphite carbon are marked at the 2θ values of 36.59
and 44.52° corresponding to (020) and (101) planes of orthorhombic
primitive and hexagonal primitive lattices (JCPDS FN: PDF#898491,
898487).

UV–Visible Absorption Spectra Analysis
The UV–visible
spectra of all five sets of nanoparticles show typical characteristic
spectra of nanoparticles of Pd metals (Figure 2), with obvious absence of surface plasmon
peak.51,57 Each profile shows continuous increase in
absorbance at lower wavelength (higher frequency), indicating the
formation of nanoparticle with higher band gap. The absorbance values
particularly at the UV region, of different sets of global nanoparticles
synthesized, vary as A > B > C > D > E, according to the
reverse order
of average diameter, as presented in Scheme 1.

of the same catalyst particles and presented on the right-hand side
of the corresponding micrographs. The corresponding average diameter
of the particles decreases with increase of the amount of reducing
agent and stabilizer used, as expected.57−59 The high-resolution
TEM images of catalysts A, C, and E (Figure 4) reveal that d spacing
is around 0.232 nm, which corresponds to (111) planes of FCC Pd nanoparticles
(PDF#011312).

Salient Features of the Suzuki–Miyaura Coupling Reaction
Palladium nanoparticles of smaller diameters are more effective
catalysts compare to larger ones, as evidenced from Figure S1 and Tables S1–S5 presented in the Supporting
Information. These also act excellently in green solvents compared
to hazardous aprotic organic solvents like CH3CN, where
the catalytic efficiency of the Pd nanoparticles is decreased plausibly
due to agglomeration. Table 1 shows the effect of medium and the leaving group of the aryl
halides in the Suzuki–Miyaura reaction. Initially, three pure solvents
C2H5OH, H2O, and CH3CN
are studied, and it is found that protic organic solvent, ethanol,
is the best, as revealed from the percent yield of biphenyl, turn
over number (TON), and turn over frequency (TOF). The presence or
generation of heterogeneity in the reaction mixture due to less solubility
of any component of the reaction mixture or less dispersion of the
catalyst seems to be the cause of decreased kinetics in highly polar
protic solvent H2O and dipolar aprotic CH3CN.
Notably, base K2CO3 and product biphenyl are
less soluble in CH3CN and water, respectively. Since the
relative stability of the transition state with respect to that of
the reactants is required for better kinetics,60 the reaction has also been studied in 1:1 and 1:3 v/v ratios
of aqueous ethanol. It is found that the latter provides much better
kinetics than that obtained from pure H2O and C2H5OH. It is found that the TON and TOF values can be improved
significantly by reducing the content of the catalyst in the reaction
mixture and increasing the time of reaction, as evident in Table 1. Reaction conducted
at room temperature (30 °C) shows 63% yield of biphenyl in 4.5
h (Table 2). The percentage
of yield and apparent TON are gradually increased with time for each
catalyst, indicating the ability of the catalyst to regenerate and
continue the reaction (Tables S1–S5). The TOF value decreases with increase of time, indicating decrease
in the concentration of the reactants with time (Tables S1–S5). The rate is found to be independent
of the concentration of phenylboronic acid, as can be revealed in Table S6. The coupling product obtained from
column chromatography of reaction is identified by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and IR spectroscopy techniques (Figures S2–S4, SD1). Since the rate-determining step
of the reaction is the oxidative addition of Pd to ArX with the formation
of Ar–Pd–X as intermediate,61,62 the reaction is of first order with respect to ArX, where X = Cl,
Br, I, etc., and the C–X bond energy (presented in parenthesis
in kJ mol–1) is in the order C–Cl (338) >
C–Br (276) > C–I (238), the yield and apparent TON
values
are greater for catalyst-A in the reverse order of aryl halides.63,64 The percentage of yield for biphenyl gradually decreases in the
order of the catalysts: A > B > C > D > E. This variation
shows exactly
the size correspondence,53 that is, smaller
the average diameter of the set of particles, greater the yield of
biphenyl compound in the same time interval. However, the apparent
turn over frequency (TOF) or rate of formation of biphenyl for each
catalyst decreases with time because of decreasing concentration of
aryl halide (ArX) and, in most cases, the active sites of catalyst
with time, the concentration of phenylboronic acid being taken in
excess. Since the concentration of the catalyst remains same throughout
the reaction, the apparent first-order rate constants (k1) are determined for iodobenzene for all of the catalysts,
and the data are presented in Table 3, as obtained from the initial linear portion of the
profiles presented in Figure S5. The %
yield and the rate constants are found to decrease with increase in
the diameter of the catalyst. To get an insight into the fate of the
catalyst during reaction, the rate of change of the activation of
the catalyst (b) or the deactivation of catalyst
during reaction must be considered. Thus, the effective concentration
of the catalyst at any time t after onset of the
reaction is given by 1  where C0 is the
initial concentration of the catalyst in the solution at time t = 0. Notably, b might be positive or
negative depending on the activation or deactivation of the catalyst.

The differential form of the
rate equation may be written as 2  where k2 is the
second-order rate constant, independent of catalyst concentration,
“a” is the initial concentration of
the reactant, “x” is the concentration
of the product that increases with time t, and k1 is the first-order rate constant dependent
on catalyst concentration in the reaction. Therefore, the integrated
form of rate equation becomes (SD2) 3  So, k2 and b are obtained from the intercepts
and slopes of the plots
of  versus time (t) (Figure S6). The values of k2 and b for different catalysts
are presented
in Table 4.

a Initial concentration of the catalyst
in the solution (C0) is 0.296 mM.

Table 4 shows that
the rate constant (k2) of the Suzuki–Miyaura
reaction increases 5 (65.7/12.5) times, whereas the average particle
diameter (Table 3)
decreases and the increment in total surface area is ca. 4 times (7.4/1.9)
for changing the catalyst from A to E. This indicates that greater
catalytic activity of catalyst A is not only due to increased surface
area but also due to the presence of more active surface molecules
in A compared to other catalysts, B–E during the progress of
the reaction. The positive sign of b in catalyst
A indicates more activation of the catalyst, whereas the negative
sign might be stated as effective deactivation for catalysts, B–E.
The activation found for catalyst-A might be due to the removal of
PVA from the part of surface of the nanoparticles and associated disintegration
causing decrease in the diameter of the particles during reaction
at the time of removal of PVA. From B to D, the deactivation increases
plausibly because of immediate growth of particles. For catalyst E,
the effective deactivation was not large seemingly because the average
diameter of particles was initially very large. The values reveal
that the second-order rate constants gradually increase with decrease
in the diameter of the particles, indicating greater binding ability
of the particles with ArX. The activation parameter b reveals that it decreases with increase in diameter. The set of
nanoparticles with greater average diameter has relatively less number
of active sites in the reaction. So, the progress of the reaction
cannot make their fate much worse in terms of the number of active
sites.

By comparing the value of rate constant of the Suzuki–Miyaura
coupling reaction with iodobenzene and phenylboronic acid using 0.2
mol % Pd nanoparticles (catalyst-A) at two different temperatures
(30 and 60 °C) (Tables 2 and S1), the activation energy
of the reaction was found to be 60.6 kJ mol–1.

Recyclability of the Catalyst
To study the level of
reusability for practical applications, the best- and worst-performing
catalysts A and E were selected for the recycling in the Suzuki–Miyaura
reaction (Table 5).65−67 The result shows that the % yield in 1.5 h increases slightly in
the third cycle in comparison to that in the first cycle for catalyst-A,
whereas it decreases gradually for catalyst-E with increase of the
cycle number. This indicates that catalyst-A can be used for a greater
number of times in recycling of catalyst than catalyst-E.

The scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images of catalyst-A before
and after single run (use) are depicted in Figure 5a,b, respectively. In Figure 5a, it is evident that the globular nanoparticles
with average diameter of 20.1 nm are mostly present in PVA matrix,
whereas the particles are mostly distinct and uniformly distributed
in the absence of such matrix, as evident in Figure 5b. The average diameter of the particles
of used catalyst-A is 8.3 nm, less than that obtained before use of
the catalyst. This type of removal of PVA from the surface of the
catalyst with an effect of increased rate of reaction (current density)
in cyclic voltammetric experiment was observed in our previous study.60 For catalyst-E, the average diameter of the
Pd nanoparticles is 27.4 nm before use of the catalyst (Figure 5c). It is decreased to 15.2
nm after the first run due to the removal of PVA during reaction (Figure 5d). Pd nanoparticles
are initially stabilized (wrapped) by PVA for both catalysts A and
E, but for catalyst A to a greater extent than catalyst E because
of the higher surface energy of the former. Due to approach of reactant
molecules toward Pd nanoparticle surface for undergoing reaction,
PVA is removed from certain relevant portion of the surface of nanoparticle
and covers the other nearby part of the nanoparticle to a greater
extent, facilitating disintegration of nanoparticles. Thus, the particle
size is reduced in both cases at the initial state of the reaction.
However, the particles with greater size, containing less stabilizing
layer initially, would agglomerate first with the progress of the
reaction. Thus, the particles of catalyst-E quickly agglomerate to
a sufficient extent to form several flakes reducing the number of
active sites during reaction, as evident from Figure 5d.

A and E before
use (a, c) and after single run (1.5 h) (b, d). The histograms are
presented on the right-hand side of the corresponding images.

Conclusions
Sets
of PVA-encapsulated Pd nanoparticles of average diameter 1.9–7.4
nm have been synthesized and used in size-dependent catalysis of the
Suzuki–Miyaura reaction. The catalyst shows a high efficiency
in 75% (v/v) ethanol–water, which seems to be the best medium
of optimum composition in ethanol–water binary solvent system.
Besides evaluation of the effect of the leaving group and catalytic
parameters, a new kinetic equation is proposed to study the catalyst
activation and deactivation during the progress of reaction. It is
understood from the new analysis strategy that the effective catalyst
concentration is changed with the progress of the reaction. For catalyst
with the least average diameter (1.9 nm), PVA encapsulated is partly
removed during the reaction, causing disintegration, so effective
catalyst concentration is increased, whereas for other catalysts synthesized
and studied, it is decreased due to agglomeration in the absence of
a sufficient stabilizing layer. Microscopic studies of the catalysts
before and after use conform to the findings.

Experimental Section
General
Information
The UV–visible spectra of
the as-synthesized particles were recorded using a UV-1800 Shimadzu
UV spectrophotometer. NMR spectra of the product of the Suzuki–Miyaura
coupling reaction were obtained using a Bruker Advance 300 MHz spectrometer
equipped with a high-resolution multinuclear probe in CDCl3. X-ray powder diffraction (PXRD) patterns of carbon powder-adsorbed
Pd catalyst were recorded on a Bruker AXS D8-Advance instrument with
Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at 40
kV and 40 mA, employing a scanning rate of 0.2 s per step. SEM measurements
were performed under vacuum by INSPECT F 50, using 20.00 kV. Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded with an H7600 TEM,
HITACHI instrument. IR spectra were recorded using NICOLET MAGNA IR
750.

Materials
PdCl2 with a purity of 99% was
purchased from Arora-Matthey Ltd; water from Synergy of Millipore;
NaBH4, phenylboronic acid, iodobenzene, bromobenzene, and
chlorobenzene from Spectrochem Pvt. Ltd; and PVA (number-average molecular
weight: 1 25 000) from Lab Rasayan Co. The solvent and
other reagents were of AR/GR grade from Merck, India.

Size Control
Syntheses of Palladium Nanoparticles
The
typical preparation of catalyst-A is described as follows: 0.5 mL
of 0.05636 (M) K2PdCl4 aqueous solution was
taken in a 100 mL beaker along with 24.5 mL of 1 mass % (mass/volume)
PVA solution. The whole solution was continuously stirred with addition
of 3.19 mg (8.454 × 10–5 mol) of NaBH4 for 10 min. The yellow color of Pd(II) solution changed to dark
brown at room temperature (30 °C), indicating the formation of
palladium nanoparticles. For the size control syntheses
of Pd/PVA catalysts designated as A, B, and C, NaBH4 was
varied in the ratio of 6:3:2 keeping fixed concentration of K2PdCl4 and PVA, as presented in Scheme 1. In the preparation of catalyst
samples A, D, and E, the PVA solution was varied in the ratio of 24.5:5:1
keeping a fixed concentration of NaBH4 and K2PdCl4 at the start of the reaction.68 These particles were then characterized by using various
techniques.

Palladium Nanoparticles-Catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura
Coupling
Reaction
The Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reaction (Scheme S1 in Supporting Information) was carried
out in a closed 25 mL round-bottom flask by taking 1 × 10–3 mol aryl halide, 1.3 × 10–3 mol phenylboronic acid, 2 × 10–3 mol anhydrous
K2CO3, and nanocatalyst containing 2 ×
10–6 mol of Pd atom at room temperature (30 °C)
and 60 °C at different intervals for a definite period of time.
Afterward, biphenyl was separated by extraction with diethyl ether
(thrice with 15 mL of diethyl ether) dried by addition of anhydrous
sodium sulfate and analyzed by column chromatography.69 In column chromatography, a slurry of silica gel in petroleum
ether (60–80 °C) was taken as stationary phase and 5%
ethyl acetate–petroleum ether as mobile phase at a rate of
flow of 0.1 mL min–1, during the separation and
purification. The product (biphenyl) was identified by determination
of melting point and 1H NMR spectroscopy analysis at every
stage. During the course of reaction at 60 °C, it was observed
that the whole reaction mixture becomes pale brownish throughout the
solution. After a definite time, 15 mL of ice-cold brine solution
was added and the whole solution becomes white, with some white shining
crystal deposits at the bottom of the flask. The kinetic analyses
of catalysts A–E were done by estimating the amounts of biphenyl
product at different time intervals through column chromatography.

The recycling process was performed with catalysts A and E, at
60 °C by separation of biphenyl from the reaction mixture and
by extraction with diethyl ether (three times) without addition of
brine solution. Then, the catalyst was separated by centrifuge, dried,
redispersed, and used in the next cycle.
