The key impact and significance of
a multilayer polymer-based dielectric
system on the remarkable photoresponse properties of zinc phthalocyanine
(ZnPc)-based photosensitive organic field-effect transistors (PS-OFETs)
have been systematically analyzed at various incident optical powers.
A combination of inorganic aluminum oxide (Al2O3) and organic nonpolar poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is used as
the bilayer dielectric configuration, whereas in the trilayer dielectric
system, a bilayer polymer dielectric, consisting of PMMA, as the low-k dielectric polymer, on top of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA),
the high-k polar dielectric, has been fabricated
along with Al2O3 as the third layer. Before
fabricating the OFETs, a systematic optimization of the nature of
growth of the ZnPc molecules, deposited on PMMA-coated glass substrates
at different substrate temperatures (Ts) was performed and examined by atomic-force microscopy, field-emission
scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Raman analysis.
At 90 °C, the fabricated PS-OFETs with the Al2O3/PVA/PMMA trilayer dielectric configuration showed the best
p-channel behavior, with an enhanced and remarkable photoresponsivity
of R ∼ 9689.39 A W–1 compared
to that of the Al2O3/PMMA bilayer dielectric
system (R ∼ 2679.40 A W–1) due to the polarization of the dipoles inside the polar PVA dielectric,
which increases the charge transport through the channel. The charge
carrier mobility of the device also improved by one order (μh ∼ 1.3 × 10–2 cm2 V–1 s–1) compared to that of
the bilayer dielectric configuration (μh ∼
3.5 × 10–3 cm2 V–1 s–1). The observed specific detectivity (D*) and NEP values of the bilayer dielectric system were
6.01 × 1013 Jones and 2.655 × 10–17 W Hz–1/2, whereas for the trilayer dielectric
system, the observed D* and NEP values were 5.13
× 1014 Jones and 1.043 × 10–17 W Hz–1/2, respectively. Additionally, the operating
voltage of each of the fabricated devices was also very low (−10
V) due to the influence of the inorganic high-k Al2O3 dielectric layer. The electrical stability of
all of the fabricated devices was also investigated by bias stress
analysis under both light and dark conditions in vacuum. To the best
of our knowledge, the photoresponsivity (R) reported
here with an Al2O3/PVA/PMMA trilayer dielectric
configuration is the highest reported value for thin film-based PS-OFETs,
at a remarkably low operating voltage of −10 V, on low-cost
glass substrates without indium tin oxide or/and Si/SiO2.

Introduction
Investigation of highly
efficient organic optical sensors is one
of the most promising research topics due to their potential applications
in various optoelectronic devices as low-cost active optoelectronic
components compared with their conventional inorganic counterparts.1,2 Although the widely used optical sensors, such as photodiodes, charge-coupled
devices, and so forth, consisting of inorganic active materials show
promising sensitivity, their high fabrication cost, high power consumption,
and poor flexibility has reduced their demand in new-generation wearable
and flexible electronics.3 Thus, for practical
applications, it is vital that an ideal optical sensor should have
a low operating voltage, high photoresponsivity, and high optical
and electrical stability and that it should be low in cost and versatile
in fabrication on the desired substrate, preferably using economical
solution-based techniques. In this regard, organic π-conjugated
semiconductor-based photosensitive organic field-effect transistors
(PS-OFETs) offer numerous advantages, including their unique ability
to detect light; low noise; switching capability; signal magnification
in a single, low-cost manufacturing; and flexible device configuration.4,5 PS-OFETs is a three-terminal photosensitive organic electronic component,
in which photogenerated excitons at the active channel can easily
be dissociated through the applied gate bias, which provides highly
effective and magnified photodetection. However, for the fabrication
of highly photoresponsive/sensitive OFETs, several factors have to
be considered: (i) the active material should have a high and broad
absorption spectrum so that maximum number of carriers can be generated
by the incident light, (ii) the mobility of the active material should
be superior to obtain easy transportation of the photogenerated charge
carrier through the channel, and (iii) the energy barrier between
the active material and electrodes should be as low as possible so
that the charge carriers can be collected for signal efficiently.6 Generally point (i) can be improved through different
chemical syntheses protocols by modulating the chemical structure
of the active material. However, the low mobility of most organic
semiconductors constrains the fulfillment of points (ii) and (iii).
Herein, by introducing multilayer dielectric systems and tuning the
thin-film morphology of the active layer material at different substrate
temperature (Ts), process (ii) was modified
to realize vital improvements in the PS-OFET performance. Among organic
semiconductors, porphyrins and phthalocynines are two representative
macrocyclic systems that are used as active materials in PS-OFETs
due to their wide range of optical absorption spectra and easily tunable
electrical and optical properties, by which one can modify their thin
film growth microstructures.7,8 Because the dielectric–active
material interface and molecular packing of the active layer have
a strong influence on the mobility of OFETs, it is very important
to utilize sustainable materials, such as polymers, and clearly understand
the growth mechanism of these polymer-based dielectric layers in the
device to optimize the thin film growth structure of the deposited
active layer prior to device fabrication.9

Hence, the impact of the thin film growth structure and multilayer
polymer dielectric systems on the photoresponse properties of zinc
phthalocyanine (ZnPc)-based PS-OFETs at various incident optical powers
has been systematically analyzed. A combination of inorganic aluminum
oxide (Al2O3) and organic nonpolar poly(methyl
methacrylate) (PMMA) is used as the bilayer dielectric configuration,
whereas in the trilayer dielectric system, the bilayer polymer dielectric,
consisting of PMMA as the low-k dielectric polymer,
on the top poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), the high-k polar
dielectric, is used along with Al2O3 as the
third layer. The growth nature of the ZnPc molecules deposited on
PMMA-coated glass substrates at different substrate temperatures (Ts), that is, at room temperature (RT) and 60,
90, and 120 °C, respectively, was systematically analyzed by
various characterization techniques, such as atomic-force microscopy
(AFM), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray
diffraction (XRD), and Raman analysis, to optimize Ts for the best device performance. At 90 °C, the
fabricated PS-OFETs with the Al2O3/PVA/PMMA
trilayer dielectric configuration showed the best p-channel behavior,
with an enhanced and remarkable photoresponsivity of R ∼ 9689.39 A W–1 compared to that of the
Al2O3/PMMA bilayer dielectric system (R ∼ 2679.40 A W–1) because of superior
charge transport through the channel by polarization of the dipoles
inside the polar PVA dielectric, which increases the charge carrier
mobility by one order (μh ∼ 1.3 × 10–2 cm2 V–1 s–1) compared to that of the bilayer dielectric configuration (μh ∼ 3.5 × 10–3 cm2 V–1 s–1). The observed specific
detectivity (D*) and noise equivalent power (NEP)
values of the bilayer dielectric system were 6.01 × 1013 Jones and 2.655 × 10–17 W Hz–1/2, whereas for the trilayer dielectric system, the observed D* and NEP values were 5.13 × 1014 Jones
and 1.043 × 10–17 W Hz–1/2, respectively. Additionally, the operating voltages of each of the
fabricated devices were observed to be exceedingly low (−10
V) due to the influence of the inorganic high-k Al2O3 dielectric layer. The electrical stability of
each of the fabricated devices was also investigated by bias stress
analysis under both light and dark conditions in vacuum. To the best
of our knowledge, the photoresponsivity, R, reported
herein with the Al2O3/PVA/ PMMA trilayer dielectric
configuration is the highest value among that of all of the thin film-based
PS-OFETs, with a remarkably low operating voltage of −10 V.
This result suggests that the Al2O3/PVA/PMMA
configuration along with an appropriate Ts for ZnPc deposition generates highly efficient ITO and Si/SiO2-free devices, with benchmark photoresponsivity performances
of PS-OFETs, which are expected to have potential applications in
future low-cost and wearable optoelectronic devices.

Results and Discussion
Thin Film
Growth Structure and Surface Analysis
The
growth structure and thin-film morphology of thermally deposited ZnPc
molecules at Ts = 90 °C on PMMA-coated
glass substrates along with their respective root-mean-square roughnesses
(σrms) is shown in Figure 1. At 90 °C, the AFM and FESEM images
of the ZnPc thin film (Figure 1a,b) showed continuous and uniform fiberlike crystallinity,
with a very low σrms of ∼3.43 nm compared
to that of films deposited at other temperatures (see Figures S1 and S2). This observation was also
supported by the XRD and Raman analyses (see Figure 1c,d). It was observed that the XRD spectra
of ZnPc molecules at 90 °C showed the highest particle size, D = 22.74 nm and a d-spacing value of 12.74
Å at 2θ = 6.93°. The calculated d-spacings of all of the thin films deposited at different Ts’s along with their respective peak
positions are summarized in Table S1 and Figure S3. From the Raman spectra (see Figure S4), it was observed that up to Ts = 90 °C the integral intensities of the 1341 and 1512 cm–1 modes, which are generally responsible for the stretching
and bending vibrations of the Zn and N interaction, increased systematically
and thereafter they started showing anomalous behavior for both 1341
and 1512 cm–1 (see Figure S5a,b).10,11 However, in the case of full width at half-maximum
(see Figure S5c,d), a systematic increase
in behavior was observed from RT to 120 °C.

nm ZnPc thin films deposited on top of PMMA-coated glass substrates
at Ts = 90 °C. Inset of (c): UV–vis
absorbance spectra of ZnPc molecule at Ts = 90 °C.

This observed anomaly
in the integral intensity modes indicates
that there is a change in the planarity of the thin film growth pattern
of ZnPc molecules due to the deformation in the symmetry of the molecular
structure, which is initiated at Ts =
90 °C because of the interaction of the heavy Zn atom with nitrogen,
indicating that Ts has a strong influence
on the growth structure of ZnPc molecules and 90 °C is the optimum Ts for ZnPc-OFET fabrication. The bandgap of
the ZnPc molecules at 90 °C, estimated from the Q-band first
peak maxima (at 624 nm) (inset of Figure 1c) is ∼1.97 eV, whereas for the second
maxima (699 nm), it is ∼1.77 eV, which indicates that ZnPc
could be easily excited and be responsive to visible light. The details
of all of the experimental observations are given in the Supporting
Information (Figures S1–S5).

Device
Fabrication and Characterization
ZnPc-based
PS-OFETs were fabricated on bilayer (Al2O3/PMMA)
and trilayer (Al2O3/PVA/PMMA) dielectric systems
with a bottom-gate top-contact configuration. Schematic representations
are shown in the Operational Mechanism section.
Generally, for low-voltage operation and reduced power consumption,
high-k dielectrics are used in the case of OFET fabrications.12,13 There are several high-k inorganic dielectric materials
that are used in OFETs, such as Al2O3, which
is one of the most promising materials because of its excellent insulating
properties and low-cost deposition process.14 In this study, Al2O3 is used as the high-k inorganic dielectric layer for low-voltage operation,
which is deposited by the anodic oxidation method, with a constant
current density of 0.06 mA cm–2 at 10 V, in a 0.001
M citric acid monohydrate electrolyte solution, followed by the procedure
mentioned in the earlier report.15

Citric acid was used for the deposition of barrier-type Al2O3 to reduce the leakage current problem of the anodized
inorganic dielectric layer. Because the grown Al2O3 thin film inherently has a very high surface roughness (σrms ∼ 11.22 nm), a 100 nm PMMA (30 mg mL–1 in anisole) film was spun on top of the Al2O3 layer and dried for 1 h at 100 °C under an inert atmosphere
to obtain a smooth surface (σrms ∼ 1.97 nm)
(see Figure S6).

However, in the
case of the Al2O3/PMMA bilayer
dielectric system, although the devices were highly stable and hysteresis-free,
the drain current was less and charge transportation through the channel
was poor. Hence, a high-k polar PVA dielectric was
inserted in between PMMA and Al2O3 layers so
that the polar PVA dielectric could induce more charges into the channel,
and further, the nonpolar PMMA dielectric would prevent direct interaction
of the −OH groups of the polar PVA dielectric layer with the
active layer molecules. As a result, enhancement of the drain current,
with superior device stability, could be achieved simultaneously.
The capacitance densities (Ci) of the
Al2O3/PMMA and Al2O3/PVA/PMMA
gate insulators were calculated independently from the metal–insulator–metal
structure of a parallel-plate capacitor, using copper as the top electrode
(see Figure S7). After the deposition of
gate dielectric layers, a 60 nm (±10 nm) ZnPc active material
was deposited by thermal deposition under a base pressure of 10–6 mbar at Ts = 90 °C.
Further, Cu source–drain electrodes were thermally deposited
at RT (∼80 nm) to calculate the three terminal properties of
the PS-OFETs.

The photoresponse characteristics of ZnPc-based
PS-OFETs with Al2O3/PMMA and Al2O3/PVA/PMMA
gate dielectric configurations under various incident optical power
illuminations are shown in Figure 2. The typical channel length (L) and
channel width (W) of the devices were kept at 40
and 780 μm, respectively. Figure 2a,c represents the drain characteristics of the devices
with bilayer and trilayer device configurations illuminated with the
lowest optical power (Pin = 0.002 W m–2), whereas Figure 2b,d represents the shift in the threshold voltage in
the transfer characteristic curve of the devices under irradiation
with various optical powers. From these drain and transfer characteristics,
it could be concluded that the device with the Al2O3/PVA/PMMA configuration showed a significant increase in the
drain current with a low operating voltage under illumination with
light compared to that of the Al2O3/PMMA configuration
due to the slow polarization of the dipole in vacuum present at the
high-k PVA dielectric that induced more charges at
the semiconducting channel of the PS-OFETs. The photoresponsivity
(R) of the device was calculated by using eq 1 1  where IPh represents
the source-to-drain photocurrent; Popt is the incident light power; IDS,dark and IDS,illum are the source–drain
current under dark and illumination conditions; and Pin represents the power of the incident light per unit
area, respectively. S is the effective sensing area
of the device.

It was observed that the Al2O3/PVA/PMMA
devices
showed remarkable photoresponsive behavior, R ∼
9689.39 A W–1, at VDS = −7 V and VGS = −8 V
under illumination with a very low optical power, Pin = 0.002 W m–2, over a small effective
sensing area, S = 2.54 × 10–6 cm2. The photo ON/OFF current ratio of the same device
is observed to be 5.8 under irradiation with the highest optical power, Pin = 0.2957 W m–2, with the
same biasing condition. Moreover, the operating voltage of the device
was also incredibly low (−10 V), confirming the consumption
of very less electrical power to operate this device. The graphical
representation of IDS versus VDS and the photocurrent and responsivity curves for different
incident powers and VGS values for both
the dielectric configurations are shown in Figures S8 and S9. All device parameters of the ZnPc-based PS-OFETs
in the dark and under various optical power illuminations with the
Al2O3/PMMA and Al2O3/PVA/PMMA
dielectric configurations are summarized in Table 1.

Operational
Mechanism
Figure 3 schematically represents the operation mechanism
of ZnPc-based PS-OFETs under dark and light illumination conditions,
with (Figure 3a–f)
Al2O3/PMMA bilayer and (Figure 3g–l) Al2O3/PVA/PMMA
trilayer device configurations, respectively. The voltage applied
between the source and drain and the gate and source are represented
by VDS and VGS, respectively. As the devices were fabricated in a bottom-gate top-contact
configuration, the amount of current flow from the source to the drain
contacts through the ZnPc thin film and is strongly dependent on the
amount of gate voltage, VGS, applied through
the gate electrode for a particular VDS. Because the semiconducting layer and gate electrode are capacitively
coupled with each other through the multilayer dielectric system,
the charges induced in the semiconductor thin film are generally mobile
charges and move in response to the particular VDS.

Figure 3 Schematic representation of the operation mechanism involved in
ZnPc-based p-channel OFETs (a–f) with Al2O3/PMMA bilayer and (g–l) Al2O3/PVA/PMMA
trilayer device configurations.

Figure 3a,g
represents
the general schematic of the two different device configurations,
namely, Al2O3/PMMA and Al2O3/PVA/PMMA. Under the dark condition, when VDS = VGS = 0 V (see Figure 3b,h), both the devices are
in the “OFF” state because no current flows from the
source to the drain contacts. Under this equilibrium condition, when
light is illuminated onto the channel with a minimum threshold power
(Figure 3c,i), excitons
are formed in the semiconductor layer. However, as VDS = VGS = 0 V, there is no
current flow from the source to the drain and only the photogenerated
charge carriers are present in the semiconductor layer. When VDS < 0 V and VGS = 0 V (Figure 3d,j),
positively charged holes, initially present in the p-type ZnPc semiconductor,
start moving toward the negatively biased drain contact.

At
the same time, the photogenerated excitons begin to dissociate
due to the applied VDS and increase the
positive charge carrier concentration at the channel. Because there
are no mobile charges present under this condition (as VGS = 0 V), the total current between the source and drain
is negligible at this stage. When the gate voltage is applied, that
is, VDS < 0 V and VGS < 0 V, in the case of the Al2O3/PMMA device configuration (Figure 3e), mobile charges are induced in the ZnPc semiconductor
thin film through the bilayer dielectric system and the transistor
comes to its “ON” state. These mobile charges create
a large electric field at the semiconductor–dielectric interface,
which shift the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of the semiconductor upward
to match the HOMO to the Fermi level of the copper drain contact.
Because VDS is already less than 0 V under
this condition, more positively charged holes will flow through the
channel, thereby increasing the drain current. Moreover, the additional
holes present in the channel due to the light illumination further
enhances the drain current in the presence of light compared to that
in the dark. When the gate voltage decreases from a more negative
value to a less negative value (i.e., gate voltage sweeps from −10
to 0 V) under the same conditions, that is, VDS < 0 V and VGS < 0 V (Figure 3f), the concentration
of mobile charges starts to decrease immediately at the PMMA–semiconductor
thin-film interface, which further shifts the HOMO and LUMO levels
of the semiconductor downward to the Fermi level of the copper drain
contact. As a result, the current starts to decrease. As PMMA is a
nonpolar polymer dielectric, trapping of charges at the semiconductor–dielectric
interface becomes less, which is also proven by hysteresis analysis
(Figure 4b). A similar
phenomenon also takes place in the case of the Al2O3/PVA/PMMA trilayer dielectric configuration. The nonpolar
PMMA dielectric layer was used here on top of the polar PVA dielectric
to prevent direct contact of the polar —OH groups in the PVA
dielectric with the semiconductor thin film so that trapping of the
charges becomes less at the PMMA–ZnPc interface compared to
that at the PVA–ZnPc interface. PVA is a high-k dielectric polymer containing polar —OH groups that are randomly
distributed when VGS = 0 V. When the gate
voltage is applied, that is, VDS <
0 V and VGS < 0 V (Figure 3k), these —OH groups
present at the PVA layer start polarizing slowly, and at maximum VGS, almost all of the groups are fully polarized.
These polarized —OH groups generate an additional electric
field at the PVA and PMMA dielectric interface, which can further
help induce more mobile charges at the PMMA–semiconductor thin-film
interface. These induced mobile charges along with the photogenerated
charges further increase the concentration of holes at the channel.
As a result, the drain current becomes higher under this condition
compared to that in the bilayer dielectric configuration (Figure 3e). When the gate
voltage decreases from a more negative value to a less negative value,
as in the bilayer dielectric system under the same condition, that
is, VDS < 0 V and VGS < 0 V (Figure 3l), the same mechanism as that in Figure 3f is expected to take place.
However, because of the slow polarization of the hydroxyl group at
the PVA dielectric, the polarity of the electric field at the PVA–PMMA
changes very slowly. As a result, although VGS sweeps from −10 to 0 V, at this stage, some positively
polarized mobile charges remain at the PMMA–semiconductor thin-film
interface, which oppose the sudden decay of the drain current, resulting
in a hysteresis of the transfer characteristics (Figure 4d).

Figure 4 (a, b) and (c, d) Graphical
representations of bias stress and
hysteresis measurements of ZnPc-PS-OFETs with Al2O3/PMMA and Al2O3/PVA/PMMA, respectively.

Further, to study the operational
stability of both the fabricated
bilayer and trilayer PS-OFETs, the time-dependent decay of IDS in dark and light conditions under direct
current (DC) bias stress at VDS = −7
V and VGS = −8 V over 1200 s was
recorded (Figure 4a,b).
It was observed that the decay of drain current in the Al2O3/PMMA device configuration was very slow compared to
that in Al2O3/PVA/PMMA due to lesser trapping
of charges at the dielectric–semiconductor interface. Additionally,
for Al2O3/PVA/PMMA, an anomalous bias stress
effect was observed due to slow polarization of the hydroxyl group.
Moreover, although in both dielectric configurations the charge trap
density increases (Table 1) in the presence of light illumination compared to that in
dark, in the bias stress study, lesser decay of IDS was obtained in the presence of light compared to that
in the dark because of the higher IDS values
in the presence of light at VGS = −8
V and VDS = −7 V. This is because
electron–hole pairs are generated in the organic semiconductor
after illumination. The excited electrons are transferred from the
HOMO to the LUMO level. As a result, we observed enhancement in the
drain current in the presence of light illumination.

To analyze
the relaxation characteristics of both the fabricated
devices, their rise and decay responses were fitted with eqs 2 and 3 (see Figure S10) to estimate the growth and decay
processes of IDS. 2   3  where IDS,dark is the dark current, A and B are
the scaling constants, t is the time when the light
was turned ON or OFF, and τ1 and τ2 are the time constants. Time constant τ1 represents
the carrier generation and recombination processes in the semiconductor
thin film, and τ2 is related to the hole-trapping
and -release processes at the interface.

In these ZnPc-based
PS-OFETs with the Al2O3/PMMA bilayer dielectric
system, the estimated time constants, τ1 and τ2, were observed to be 0.98 and 9.59
s for the decay and 0.43 s for the growth process, respectively. For
the Al2O3/PVA/PMMA trilayer dielectric system,
the estimated τ1 and τ2 for the
decay process were observed to be 0.87 and 5.95 s and for the growth
process both τ1 and τ2 were 0.43
s, respectively. From all of these experimental data, it is clear
that the required time for carrier generation and recombination in
the semiconductor thin film for both the dielectric systems is almost
similar, whereas the time required for the hole trapping and release
processes at the interface is much lower for the trilayer dielectric
system compared to that for the Al2O3/PMMA bilayer
system.

Generally, for an ideal optical sensor it is necessary
that the
device should be cost-effective, stable, and operated under a low
operating voltage so that less electrical power is required during
device operation. Most of the remarkable organic optical sensors reported
until date are generally fabricated on Si/SiO2- or ITO-based
substrates, which significantly enhances the overall device cost,
coupled with a higher power consumption. In this regard, a highly
photoresponsive ZnPc nanobelt-based light-sensing OFET on an octadecyltrichlorosilane-modified
Si/SiO2 substrate with gold (Au) as the top source–drain
contact was reported.16 Similarly, CuPc/pentacene-based
PS-OFETs deposited on an Si/SiO2 substrate showed photoresponses
of 0.5–2 and 10–50 A W–1 and a maximum
photo ON/OFF current ratio of 3000 and 1.3 × 105,
respectively, under 365 nm UV light.17 However,
due to the extensive use of either ITO or Si/SiO2 substrates,
all of these devices had a very high operating voltage that increased
the external electrical power requirement to operate the device.

In this study, the significant influence of the thin film growth
structure and trilayer polymer dielectric system on the highest photoresponse
properties of ZnPc-based PS-OFETs at various incident optical powers
is reported. At 90 °C, the PS-OFETs with the Al2O3/PVA/PMMA configuration showed the best p-channel behavior,
with an enhanced and remarkable photoresponsivity of R ∼ 9689.39 A W–1 compared to that of the
Al2O3/PMMA bilayer dielectric system (R ∼ 2679.40 A W–1) due to superior
charge transport through the channel by the polarization of dipoles
inside the polar PVA dielectric, which increases the charge carrier
mobility, which is one order higher (μh ∼
1.3 × 10–2 cm2 V–1 s–1) compared to that of the bilayer dielectric
configuration (μh ∼ 3.5 × 10–3 cm2 V–1 s–1). The
observed specific detectivity, D*, and NEP [where D* = RS1/2(2eIDS,dark)−1/2 and NEP = (2eIDS,dark)1/2R–1; e is the value of the electron charge] values
of the bilayer dielectric system are 6.01 × 1013 Jones
and 2.655 × 10–17 W Hz–1/2, whereas those for the trilayer dielectric system are 5.13 ×
1014 Jones and 1.043 × 10–17 W Hz–1/2, respectively. Additionally, the operating voltages
of each of the fabricated devices were observed to be very low (−10
V) due to the influence of the inorganic high-k Al2O3 dielectric layer. The electrical stability of
each of the fabricated devices was also investigated by bias stress
analysis under both light and dark conditions in vacuum. To the best
of our knowledge, the photoresponsivity, R, reported
here in the case of the Al2O3/PVA/PMMA trilayer
dielectric configuration is the highest reported value among that
of all of the thin film-based PS-OFETs, with a remarkably low operating
voltage of −10 V. This study confirmed that the Al2O3/PVA/PMMA trilayer dielectric configuration is a highly
efficient, ITO- and Si/SiO2-free system that enhances the
photoresponsivity of PS-OFETs to a considerably high level, which
was not observed previously in any thin film-based OFETs, and is expected
to have applications in future low-cost and wearable optoelectronic
devices.

Conclusions
We have successfully
reported a “thin film-based OFET”
with the highest photosensitivity. This was achieved by utilizing
multilayered polymer-based dielectric systems and optimizing the impact
of thin film growth structure to obtain superior photoresponse properties
of ZnPc-based PS-OFETs at various incident optical powers. It has
been established that the thermally evaporated ZnPc films at 90 °C
on PMMA thin film-coated glass substrates at different substrate temperatures
exhibit a polycrystalline nature, as evident from AFM, FESEM, XRD,
and Raman analysis. At 90 °C, the fabricated PS-OFETs with the
Al2O3/PVA/PMMA trilayer dielectric configuration
showed a p-channel behavior, with an enhanced and remarkable photoresponsivity
of R ∼ 9689.39 A W–1, whereas
the Al2O3/PMMA bilayer dielectric system showed
a photoresponsivity of R ∼ 2679.40 A W–1. This was because of superior charge transport through
the channel by the polarization of the dipoles inside the polar PVA
dielectric. Overall, this increases the charge carrier mobility by
one order (μh ∼ 1.3 × 10–2 cm2 V–1 s–1) compared
to that of the bilayer dielectric configuration (μh ∼ 3.5 × 10–3 cm2 V–1 s–1), with a very low operating
voltage (−10 V) due to the influence of the inorganic high-k Al2O3 dielectric layer. The electrical
stability of each of the fabricated devices was also investigated
by bias stress analysis under both light and dark conditions in vacuum.
To the best of our knowledge, the photoresponsivity, R, reported here in the case of the Al2O3/PVA/PMMA
trilayer dielectric configuration is the highest among that of all
of the thin film-based PS-OFETs, with a remarkably low operating voltage
of −10 V. This Al2O3/PVA/PMMA device
with an ITO- and Si/SiO2-free system displayed PS-OFETs
with very high photoresponsivity at a low operating voltage and is
expected to open newer avenues in the field of electronic devices,
energy-efficient sensors, and future low-cost wearable optoelectronic
devices.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
ZnPc (99.999% purity),
PMMA (MW = 550 000 kg mol–1), aluminum
wire (99.999% purity), and copper wire (99.9% purity) were purchased
from Sigma Aldrich. Anisole (99% purity) and PVA (MW ∼ 115 000) were purchased from Loba Chemie.
All chemicals and materials were used as received, unless otherwise
mentioned. Microscope glass slides (thickness ∼1.2 mm), purchased
from Jain Scientific Glass Works, India, were used as the device substrate
without any surface modification.

Characterization Details
The thin films of ZnPc were
deposited by the thermal evaporation technique under 10–6 mbar pressure. The thicknesses of the thin films were measured by
a Veeco Dektak 150 Surface Profilometer. A Perkin-Elmer Lambda 25
UV–vis spectrophotometer was used to record the UV–vis
absorption spectra. AFM images of the thin films were recorded on
an Agilent 5500-STM instrument. Raman spectra were recorded on an
HR 800 Raman Spectrometer. Electrochemical measurements were performed
using a CH Instrument. The thin-film XRD pattern was recorded on a
Rigaku TTRAX III, with Cu Kα radiation. For PS-OFET measurements,
white-light (quartz halogen lamp) irradiation was performed with an
Oriel DC regulated illuminator connected with Lake Shore fiber optic
probes having a core diameter ∼18 μm. The optical power
of the illuminated light was measured by both the Tenmars TM-207 power
meter and Newport optical power/energy meter (Model 842-PE). The optoelectrical
properties of all three terminals were characterized using a Keithley
4200 semiconductor characterization system with a Lake Shore vacuum
probe station and Keithley 2400 source meter.
