An atom-economical and environmentally
benign approach for the synthesis of indole-substituted 1,4-naphthoquinones
from indoles and 1,4-naphthoquinones using readily available Lewis
acidic B(C6F5)3 in water and with
the recycling of water and part of the catalyst is reported. The reaction
proceeded through the B(C6F5)3-catalyzed
C(sp2)–H and C(sp2)–H bond coupling
of 1,4-naphthoquinones with the C-3 position of indole derivatives
in water. This methodology provides a facile protocol for the synthesis
of some new indole-substituted 1,4-naphthoquinones in satisfactory
yields and with a broad substrate scope. When compared to known methods
for the synthesis of indole-substituted 1,4-naphthoquinones, this
protocol is practical and efficient and does not require a transition-metal
catalyst or toxic organic solvents. In addition, we utilized a simple
filtration process for complete recycling of the solvent and the part
of the catalyst in each reaction cycle.

==== Body
Introduction
Indole and its derivatives, as a common
subunit in various pharmaceutically
attractive and naturally occurring products, have been widely applied
in the fields of synthetic chemistry,1 materials
science,2 and medicinal chemistry.3 Particularly, the indole nucleus is a structural
component of a large number of biologically active natural and unnatural
compounds.4 Incorporation of the indole
nucleus into quinone frameworks serves as a platform for the synthesis
of a potentially valuable class of indole derivatives where indolylquinones
are versatile building blocks for the construction of biologically
active natural products.5 In this regard,
indoles represent a system of particular interest and importance.
Thus, the C-2 and C-3 selective methods would be valuable. Previous
methods reported the incorporation of quinones into the C-3 position
of indoles (Scheme 1). The Pirrung group6 and others have
reported that the Lewis acids [such as Bi(OTf)3, Pd(OAc)2, CuBr2, InBr3, etc.] can catalyze the
conjugate addition reaction of indole compounds with quinones to give
3-indolylquinone compounds.7 Such a reaction
can be catalyzed by some Brønsted acids.8 Iron hydroxide nanoparticles can catalyze the coupling reaction
between p-benzoquinone and 2-methylindole, and 3-indolylquinone
was also achieved via oxidative C–C coupling of hydroquinones
with indoles over Ag2O and Fe3O4/povidone-phosphotungstic
acid catalysts using H2O2 in tetrahydrofuran.9 All of these methods have certain limitations,
such as the need for metals to act as catalysts, the use of a toxic
organic solvent, and the limited substrate scope or low yields. It
is noteworthy that coupling of indoles with 1,4-benzoquinones provides
the desired product “in water”.10 The method needs long reaction time and involves one indolyl-1,4-naphthoquinone.
Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop a simple and environmentally
benign protocol to construct indolyl-1,4-naphthoquinones.

Scheme 1 Approaches
to 3-Indolylquinone Compounds
In organic chemistry, chemists have an increasing
interest in developing
“green” processes and sustainability, which are important
issues in every area of human activity.11 The use of solvents is a key aspect among the 12 principles of green
chemistry.12 Water has emerged as a potentially
useful and safe solvent13 and is abundant,
nontoxic, noncorrosive, and nonflammable.14 There are some challenges in organic reactions in aqueous media.
First, many reactive substrates, reagents, and catalysts are decomposed
or deactivated by water.15 Second, most
organic substances are insoluble in water.16 On the other hand, water possesses many unique physical and chemical
properties: a large temperature window in which it remains in the
liquid state; extensive hydrogen bonding; high heat capacity; large
dielectric constant; and optimum oxygen solubility to maintain aquatic
life forms, which dramatically enhance the rates and affect the selectivity
of a wide variety of organic reactions.17

Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3], which has received significant attention as a nonconventional,
nontoxic, air-stable, water-tolerant, thermal abiding, and frustrated
Lewis acid,18 has been widely employed
in a number of transformations in organic chemistry including hydrogenation
reactions,19 hydrosilylation20 of unsaturated organic functions, dehydrogenative
coupling of alcohols and amines,21 dehydrogenative
oxidation,22 and other transformations.23 Owing to its highly electrophilic but sterically
protected nature, B(C6F5)3 has been
commonly employed as the Lewis acid component in frustrated Lewis
pair (FLP) chemistry to activate small molecules and in metal-free
catalysis.24

Generally, the coordination
of water with a Lewis acidic metal
complex leads to the weakening of the O–H bond.25 In this respect, the interaction of B(C6F5)3 with water has been thoroughly
investigated by different groups.26 Recently,
the group of Tang reported that B(C6F5)3 catalyzes α-diazoester insertion into the O–H
bond in water, affording various α-hydroxyesters.27 Our concept was to utilize the Brønsted
acid B(C6F5)3–H2O for the catalytic activation of C=O and the subsequent nucleophilic
addition. Herein, we report a B(C6F5)3-catalyzed C(sp2)–H and C(sp2)–H
bond coupling of 1,4-naphthoquinones with the C-3 position of indole
derivatives through conjugate addition of indole compounds to 1,4-naphthoquinones,
followed by in situ dehydrogenation in water, wherein water and part
of the catalyst were recycled under mild conditions.

Results and Discussion
Initially, we commenced our
study by monitoring a test reaction
of 1,4-naphthoquinone 1a with 1-methyl-1H-indole 2a (1.0 equiv) “in water” for
24 h at room temperature (Table 1, entry 1). It is noteworthy that our work is different
from that of Li’s group about substrates,10 in which good yields were not obtained in the absence of
other catalysts. Thus, the reaction was carried out in the presence
of B(C6F5)3 catalyst (3 mol %) in
water in open air (entry 2). To our delight, the desired product 3aa was obtained in 70% yield after a reaction time of 2 h
at room temperature. It was reported that the C-3 position of 1-methyl-1H-indole is the most reactive among its two reactive positions
(C-2 and C-3). Finally, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, mass
spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallography of 3ga (Table 3) demonstrated that
the final product is the expected structure 3aa, and
no other products were detected. Furthermore, the reaction was scrutinized
with common transition-metal Lewis acids such as Bi(OTf)3, FeCl3, etc. as catalysts, and no products were detected
or significantly lower yields were obtained (entries 3–10).
In addition, the catalytic amounts of Brønsted acid catalysts
were screened, but none provided better yields than B(C6F5)3 (entries 11 and 12). No improvement in
the transformation was observed when B(C6F5)3 catalyst (1 mol %) was employed (entry 13). Increasing the
catalyst loading resulted in 81% yield of the desired product (entry
14). The ratio of 1,4-naphthoquinone (1a) to 1-methyl-1H-indole (2a) also affected the reaction yield
profoundly, and the reaction yield could be decreased when the ratio
of 1a/2a was changed to 1:2 or 2:1 (entry
15 and 16). A higher reaction temperature resulted in an increase
in yield, affording a yield of 91% for 3aa (entry 17).
We have investigated the effect of other boron-containing agents in
water, such as B(2,4,6-F3C6H2)3 and B(3,4,5-F3C6H2) (entries
18 and 19), but none provided better yields than B(C6F5)3. The reaction afforded 36% yield for 3aa in the absence of other catalysts under 60 °C for 2 h (entry
20). After the evaluation of various reaction parameters, the best
yield of 3aa (91%) was obtained by employing 1a (0.4 mmol), 2a (1 equiv), and B(C6F5)3 (5 mol %) in water as the sole solvent in open
air under 60 °C for 2 h (entry 17). A notable B(C6F5)3 acceleration was observed in these reactions
for 2 h. Using the ratio of indole/quinone = 1:1 was also atom-economical.

With the optimized conditions established, we evaluated
the scope
and the influence of the substituents on the indole moiety. The results
are presented in Table 2. When free NH-indole (2b) was used as the substrate
under identical conditions, 3ab was obtained in 83% yield.
It is noteworthy that other N-alkylindoles (2a and 2c) also proved to be suitable coupling
partners to provide the corresponding products in good yields (91
and 86%). Unfortunately, due to the highly electron-deficient acetyl
present at the N position, no product was detected when N-acetylindole (2d) was used. Notably, N-allylindole (2e) also worked well under this protocol
and afforded the desired product 3ae in 75% yield. Unfortunately,
the reaction did not work when 2f was used as a substrate
(3af). The electron-rich indoles with a substituent at
the 2-position are good reactants. 2-Methylindole and 2-phenylindole
reacted well to give the corresponding products 3ag and 3ah in 90 and 81% yields, respectively. The electron-withdrawing
indoles (2i) with a substituent at the 2-position were
used as the substrate, but the desired product (3ai)
was obtained in traces, which is possibly due to the electron deficiency.
To our delight, 2j worked well and afforded 3aj in 72% yield. The reaction yields decreased dramatically when the
most electron-withdrawing groups (2n) were located at
the C-5 position in indoles (3an). Better yields were
obtained when the functional groups such as methoxy (2m and 2q), fluoro (2k and 2t), chloro (2l, 2o, and 2u),
and bromo (2p) were located at C-4, C-5, and C-6 positions.
We further tested this method with 5-allyloxyindole (2r) and 5-propargyloxyindole (2s); the reaction proceeded
smoothly to provide the desired products in good yields (3ar–as). In addition, 7-azaindole (2v) also worked well with 71% yield.

Table 2 Substrate Scope with Respect to the
Indolesa
a Reaction conditions: 1a (0.4 mmol), 2 (0.4 mmol), B(C6F5)3 (5 mol %), H2O (2 mL), 60 °C, 2 h,
under an air atmosphere. The isolated yield was based on 1a.

We then proceeded to study the scope of quinone derivatives. As shown in Table 3, a number of quinones underwent under optimal
conditions. Menadione was used as the substrate and 3ba was obtained in 75% yield. The above methodology worked for naphthoquinones
bearing phenyl and electron-deficient arene substituents (3ca–ea). The sensitive chlorine and bromine at the
β- position of naphthoquinone were compatible with the reaction
conditions, which can easily be transformed further by cross-coupling
reactions. The molecular structure of 3ga was further
confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Dimethylbenzoquinone
and trimethylbenzoquinone were employed, affording corresponding products 3ia and 3ja in moderate yields, respectively.
Dichlorobenzoquinone also worked well with N-methylindole
and free NH-indole under standard conditions. The work by Li’s
group reported that 3ag, 3ja, and 3ka were obtained “in water” in the absence
of the catalyst for long reaction time. We obtained products of 3ag, 3ja, and 3ka in good yields
when B(C6F5)3 acceleration was observed
in these reactions for 2 h.

Table 3 Substrate Scope with Respect to the
Quinonesa
a Reaction conditions: the reactions
were carried out in the presence of 1 (0.4 mmol), 2a (0.4 mmol), and B(C6F5)3 (5 mol %) in water (2 mL) at 60 °C with stirring for the indicated
time under an air atmosphere. The isolated yield was based on 1.

The scalability of this reaction was tested using 1a (20 mmol, 3.16 g) with 2a (20 mmol, 2.62 g)
under the
developed optimal reaction conditions. As expected, the desired product 3aa was obtained in 92% yield; these results suggested that
the methodology is an economic and practical process for the preparation
of indole-substituted quinones (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Gram-Scale Synthesis of 3aa
Owing to the excellent yield of the reaction
of 1,4-naphthoquinone 1a with 1-methyl-1H-indole (2a) (91%), the reaction was chosen to check
the recyclability of the
catalyst and the solvent. As in the literature, B(C6F5)3 has a similar affinity to the organic phase
and the aqueous phase. Considering this property, after the first
reaction, the product was easily hot filtered, while the part of B(C6F5)3 catalyst remained in the filtrate.
However, a part of the catalyst mass was lost in all trials, because
the catalyst was wrapped in the organic product. Thus, we added extra
2 mol % B(C6F5)3 into the filtrate
for the next run. The recovered filtrate containing B(C6F5)3 and added extra 2 mol % B(C6F5)3 showed remarkably constant catalytic activity
in all of the 10 cycles.

Based on previous reports and summary,
the reaction mechanism is
hypothesized in Scheme 3. At first, the Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 with H2O gives a coordinated adduct, which may exist
in equilibrium.28 The reaction is probably
the Brønsted acid activation of 1,4-naphthoquinone (1a) by B(C6F5)3–H2O.29 The in situ generated electrophilic
species A reacts with N-methylindole
(2b) in the 3-position to form 1,4-hydroquinone intermediate B and generate an anionic hydroxyboron [B(C6F5)3–OH]−. Then 1,4-naphthoquinone
oxidized the 1,4-hydroquinone intermediate B into the N-methylindole-substituted 1,4-naphthoquinone (3aa). At the same time, 1a was regenerated by the oxidation
of the 1,4-hydroquinone C under an air atmosphere in
water.30

Scheme 3 Proposed Mechanism
of 3aa
Conclusions
In summary, we have developed the B(C6F5)3-catalyzed C(sp2)–H
and C(sp2)–H bond coupling of 1,4-naphthoquinones
with the C-3 position
of indole derivatives. B(C6F5)3 was
able to catalyze a wide range of reactions involving indoles and 1,4-naphthoquinones
to yield products in moderate to good yields under open-air conditions.
Based on previous reports and summary, the proposed reaction mechanism
is hypothesized. This new protocol has proved to be economical, practical,
and eco-friendly without employing any base and organic solvent. Besides,
the recycling and recovery of B(C6F5)3 and H2O as the solvent were reported in the reaction
at first. Thus, the easy and rapid recycling protocol met the goal
of green and sustainable chemistry. The procedure should be a facile
and convenient method with the prospect of industrial applications.

Experimental Section
General Information
Chemicals and analytical-grade
solvents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without
further purification unless otherwise stated. All reagents were weighed
and handled in air at room temperature. Analytical thin-layer chromatography
(TLC) was performed on glass plates of silica gel GF-254 with detection
by UV light (254 and 365 nm). Column chromatography was carried out
on silica gel (200–300 mesh). 1H NMR spectra were
recorded at 400 MHz and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at
101 MHz using an Agilent 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. Chemical shifts
were calibrated using a residual undeuterated solvent as an internal
reference [1H NMR: CDCl3 7.26 ppm, dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO)-d6 2.50 ppm; 13C NMR: CDCl3 77.16 ppm, DMSO-d6 39.52 ppm]. Data are reported as follows: chemical shift, multiplicity
(s = singlet, br s = broad singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q =
quartet, m = multiplet); coupling constants (J) are
reported in hertz (Hz). High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was
performed on a Thermo Scientific LTQ Orbitrap XL instrument. Melting
points were measured with a micro melting point apparatus.

Procedure for the Gam-Scale Reaction
To a solution
of H2O (100 mL) were added 1,4-naphthoquinone 1a (3.16 g, 20 mmol), N-methylindole 2a (2.62 g, 20 mmol), and B(C6F5)3 (0.51 g, 1 mmol). The mixture was stirred at 60 °C (the temperature
of the oil bath) for 2 h under an air atmosphere. After the completion
of the reaction (monitored by TLC), the reaction mixture was quenched
with water (100 mL) and the aqueous phase was extracted with EtOAc
(3 × 100 mL, then 3 × 30 mL). The combined organic layer
was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated
under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by column chromatography
on silica gel to give 5.29 g of 2-(3-N-methylindolyl)-1,4-naphthoquinone
in 92% yield.

h under an air atmosphere. After the completion of the reaction (monitored
by TLC), the reaction mixture was quenched with water (2 mL) and then
extracted with EtOAc (3 × 5 mL). The combined organic layers
were washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, and
filtered, and the solvent was removed in vacuo. The residue was purified
by column chromatography on silica gel (petroleum ether/EtOAc) to
afford the desired pure product 3.
