According to the WHO, artemisinin-based
combination therapies (ACTs)
have been integral to the recent reduction in deaths due to Plasmodium falciparum malaria. ACT-resistant strains
are an emerging problem and have evolved altered developmental stages,
reducing exposure of the most susceptible stages to artemisinin drugs
in popular ACTs. Lipophilicity, log Kow, is a guide in understanding and predicting pharmacokinetic properties
such as terminal half-life which alters drug exposure. Consistent
log Kow values are not necessarily available
for artemisinin derivatives designed to extend terminal half-life,
increase bioavailability, and reduce neurotoxicity. For other drugs
used in ACTs, an assortment of experimental and computational log Kow values are available in the literature and
in some cases, do not account for subtle but important differences
between closely related structures such as between diastereomers.
Quantum chemical methods such as density functional theory (DFT) used
with an implicit solvent model allow for consistent comparison of
physical properties including log Kow and
distinguish between closely related structures. To this end, DFT,
B3LYP/6-31G(d), with an implicit solvent model (SMD) was used to compute
ΔGowo and ΔGvowo for 1-octanol–water
and olive oil–water partitions, respectively, for 21 antimalarial
drugs: 12 artemisinin-based, 4 4-aminoquinolines and structurally
similar pyronaridine, and 4 amino alcohols. The computed ΔGowo was close to ΔGowo calculated from experimental log Kow values from the literature where available,
with a mean signed error of 2.3 kJ/mol and mean unsigned error of
3.7 kJ/mol. The results allow assignment of log Kow for α-and β-diastereomers of arteether,
and prediction of log Kow for β-DHA
and five experimental drugs. Linear least square analysis of log Kow and log Kvow versus
terminal elimination half-life showed strong linear relationships,
once the data points for the 4-aminoquinoline drugs, mefloquine and
pyronaridine were found to follow their own linear relationship, which
is consistent with their different plasma protein binding. The linear
relationship between the computed log Kvow and terminal elimination half-life was particularly strong, R2 = 0.99 and F = 467, and can
be interpreted in terms of a simple pharmacokinetic model. Terminal
elimination half-life for β-DHA and four experimental artemisinin
drugs were estimated based on this linear relationship between log Kvow and terminal t1/2. The computed log Kow and log Kvow values for epimers α- and β-DHA
and α and β-arteether provide physical data that may be
helpful in understanding their different pharmacokinetics and activity
based on their different molecular geometries. Relative solubility
of quinine and quinidine are found to be sensitive to thermal corrections
to enthalpy and to vibrational entropy and do not follow the general
trend of longer terminal t1/2 with greater
predicted log Kow. Geometric relaxation
of α- and β-DHA in solvent and inclusion of thermal correction
for enthalpy and entropy results in correct prediction that α-DHA
is favored in aqueous environments compared to β-DHA. Predictions
made regarding experimental drugs have implications regarding their
potential use in response to artemisinin drug-resistant strains.

Introduction
The World Health Organization,
WHO, reported an estimated 219 million
malaria cases with 435 thousand deaths in 2017 with most of these
cases caused by the Plasmodium falciparum species of malaria, the predominant species in sub-Saharan Africa
(99.7%), South East Asia (62.8%), the Eastern Mediterranean (69%),
and Western Pacific (71.9%).1 According
to the WHO, nearly half the world’s population was at risk
of malaria in 2017 with 92% of cases and 93% of deaths taking place
in Africa and 87 countries with active malaria transmission. Since
2010, malaria deaths per 100 thousand at risk have declined worldwide.1 The WHO considers artemisinin-based combination
therapies, ACTs, as “integral to the recent success of global
malaria control”.1 The molecular
structure of artemisinin with ring conformations and junctions determined
by X-ray crystallography is shown in Figure 1. The molecular structures of dihydroartemisinin,
DHA, and other artemisinin drugs used in ACTs are shown in Figure 2.

According to Haldar et al. (2018),
resistance has emerged to all
antimalarial drugs in wide clinical use.2 In most regions where P. falciparum malaria is endemic, resistance to ACTs has not been observed. As
of 2019, for example, ACTs, in particular artesunate + amodiaquine
and artemether + lumefantrine, are efficacious and safe in Cameroon.3 Resistance differs from region to region. As
of June 2019, artemisinin and ACT-resistant malaria is well established
near the Thai–Cambodia border and spreading through the Greater
Mekong Sub-Region (GMS).4 Although ACTs
typically have >95% efficacy, from one to four ACTs now have >10%
failure rates in the GMS.1 Chloroquine-resistant
malaria first emerged in the GMS before spreading to Africa. Such
a pattern if followed by ACT resistance could be devastating. Better
understanding of how the structures and resulting physical properties
of current antimalarial drugs relate to their pharmacokinetics and
antimalarial activity can provide a useful guide for the development
of new drugs and drug therapies in the face of antimalarial drug resistance.

Artemisinin drugs in widely used ACTs have shorter elimination
half-life and act quickly, eliminating most of the parasite population
and quickly alleviating symptoms, while partner drugs with longer
elimination half-life clear the remaining parasite population and
guarantee the therapeutic outcome. Hott et al. (2015) found Cambodian F. falciparum strains with partial resistance to
artemisinin drugs to have an extended ring stage and shortened trophozoite
stage and hypothesized that this reduces drug exposure during stages
when the parasite is most susceptible, elongates stages when it is
less susceptible, and allows for ring stage dormancy to be triggered
by DHA.5 These changes in parasite development
however show less resistance to DHA than to artemisinin and artelinic
acid, a drug never used clinically in the GMS. This indicates possible
resistance against the artemisinin family of drugs rather than to
specific artemisinin drugs.5 Chandra et
al. (2015) found regulation of glutathione with l-buthionine
(S,R)-sulfoximine to increase the
efficacy against arteether-resistant Plasmodium vinckei in mice, demonstrating a possible strategy for prolonging the use
of artemisinin drugs against resistant strains.6 Hastings and Hodel (2014) note the use of combination therapy
to slow or prevent drug resistance and argue for the importance of
a pharmacological rather than a purely genetic approach toward understanding
drug resistance as a basis for design of combination therapies and
lowering effects of toxicity.7 Hastings
et al. (2016) argue the short half-life of artemisinin drugs allow
for their protection against resistance by ACT partner drugs that
kill artemisinin-resistant strains but also leave the partner drugs
as monotherapies making them more vulnerable to resistance.8 Hasting et al. (2016) discuss use of their pharmacological
model to investigate how ACT design may target developmental stages
of the malarial parasite.9 Perhaps artemisinin
derivatives with longer half-life can help to protect their ACT partners
while targeting parasite developmental stages more vulnerable to artemisinin
drugs. Although more lipophilic artemisinin derivatives with longer
elimination half-life offer greater exposure time, arteether, as an
example, is not used as widely because it has slower absorption rates
and higher risk of neurotoxicity.10 Wesche
et al. (1994) found neurotoxicity of artemisinin drugs to be sensitive
to substitution at C9 and C10 and found DHA
and artesunate which rapidly converts to DHA in vivo to have the greatest neurotoxicity.11

Design and synthesis of new artemisinin-based drugs has had
goals
of increasing elimination half-life and bioavailability while decreasing
possible neurotoxicity. Avery et al. (2002), for example, synthesized
numerous C9 artemisinin derivatives and used in
vitro and in vivo rodent evidence to narrow
to the two most promising for drug development.12 Their molecular structures, Avery-14 the most economical
and Avery-17 the most potent are shown in Figure 3.12 Bigucci et
al. (2008) tested the bioavailability of two fluoroalkyl derivatives
of DHA, 10β-(trifluoropropyloxy)dihydroartemisinin (F1-DHA), a C10 substituted compound shown in Figure 2, and 10-trifluoromethyl-16-[2-(hydroxyethyl)piperazine]
(F2-DHA), a C9 and C10 substituted
compound shown in Figure 3.13 They found evidence that the
fluoroalkyl ether substitution and C10 in F1-DHA presents an obstacle for absorption across the intestinal lining
and discuss these results in the context of solubility and their log Koct:Ringer values of 1.89 for artemisinin, 4.50
for F1-DHA, and 2.55 for F2-DHA. Their log Koct:Ringer is lower than log Kow for artemisinin reported by Haynes et al. (2006), 2.94
(experimental), and 3.17 (computational).14 Consistent lipophilicity values where available allow for comparison
of pharmacokinetic properties on a consistent basis. Methods of estimating
log Kow values that allow for comparison
on equal footing of a wide range of drugs based on their molecular
structures can be a basis for estimating relative pharmacokinetic
properties.

Computational approaches can, in some cases, quickly
estimate physical
properties such as log Kow based on molecular
structures and be effective tools for screening of potential drugs.
Although widely used methods such as Clog P(15) based on molecular fragments and ALOGPS 2.116−18 based on computational neural networks can give quick results with
high accuracy, they do not distinguish between diastereomers in their
predicted log Kow values. Clog P, for example, predicts quinine and quinidine to have the
same log Kow, whereas these two drugs
are known to have different pharmacokinetics, protein binding, and
antimalarial activity.19 Zaera et al. (2009)
using NOESY NMR methods and density functional theory, DFT, computations
found solubility differences between cinchona compound diastereomers
to be attributable to differences in vibrational entropy resulting
from a slight shift in the center of mass between diastereomers.20 Quicker computational methods generally do not
allow for as detailed an understanding of physical properties resulting
from molecular structure. There may be a range of log Kow values available in the literature for a given compound
and one may wonder which is most consistent with the drugs biological
behavior. Quantum chemical methods such as DFT can be used with an
implicit solvent model to predict molecular structural properties
in far greater detail and with good accuracy but may become both impractical
and less accurate with larger (>50 atoms) molecules with more rotatable
bonds.21 Such computations, when applied
appropriately however, can give a consistent approach toward properties
such as log Kow including subtle differences
between closely related compounds such as diastereomers and can provide
a consistent basis for understanding how structural properties are
related to physical properties and biological behavior across a group
of related compounds.

In this work, 21 antimalarial drugs from
three families, artemisinin-based
(Figures 1–3), 4-amino quinoline and structurally similar pyronaridine
(Figure 4), and amino
alcohols (Figure 5),
are studied using DFT, B3LYP, and an implicit solvent model, SMD.
Free-energy changes are computed for transfer from water to 1-octanol,
ΔGowo, and from water to olive oil, ΔGvowo. The computed ΔGowo are compared to ΔGowo calculated
from experimental log Kow values from
the literature and errors examined to identify outliers. The results
allow log Kow for three sets of diastereomers
to be clarified and estimates of log Kow are made for five experimental antimalarial drugs, β-DHA,
and the α-and β-diastereomers of arteether. Linear relationships
between log Kow and log Kvow and terminal elimination half-life are examined for
log Kow values computed using DFT and
the SMD solvent model, log Kow computed
using ALOGPS version 2.1 online, and experimental log Kow from the literature. Linear trends and statistical
outliers are considered with regard to drug family and protein binding.
The strong linear relationships that emerge can be interpreted using
a simple pharmacokinetic model and allow estimates of terminal elimination
half-life to be made for five experimental antimalarial drugs. Computed
dipole moments and computational results including geometry relaxation
in the different solvents allow some observed properties of diastereomers
to be understood in terms of their polarity and computed entropies
and enthalpies in different solvents.

Methods
Geometry optimization of
each drug was carried using the B3LYP22−25 hybrid density functional with
the 6-31G(d) basis set and followed
by vibrational analysis to confirm that a local minimum of energy
was found, that is, all positive real vibrational frequencies. A first
set of computations was carried out by coauthors TDK and SK using
Gaussian 09, Revision B.0126 and then confirmed
with corrections and revisions where needed by JDA using Gaussian
16, Revision A.03.27 Input molecular structures
for artemisinin and artemisinin derivatives were carefully checked
to have ring conformations, ring junctions, and conformations as indicated
by X-ray structures.28−30 Piperaquine is known to have a number of thermally
accessible conformers at room temperature.31 After making computations on several piperaquine conformers, a conformer
similar to that displayed as the 3D geometry on PubChem was found
to have the lowest in energy of those considered.32 Interestingly, results from implicit solvent models including
SMD are not significantly improved going from a single conformation
approach to one involving an ensemble of conformations.21 It is common practice to use implicit solvent
models with a single molecular conformation.33 The assumption in doing this is that differences in the vacuum and
solvated distribution of conformers are negligible and have negligible
enthalpic and entropic effects on the solvent.33 In this work, we use a single conformation methodology.
An effort was made to use lowest energy conformations as supported
by the literature but global energy minimum were not methodically
searched. Quinine and quinidine are also known to have several thermally
accessible conformers at room temperature. Experiment indicates that
a cis-γ-open conformer is lowest in energy and this conformation
was chosen for DFT geometry optimization in this work.34 Optimized gas phase geometries confirmed as
local energy minima with all positive real vibrational frequencies
were then used for calculations with the SMD35 solvent model also at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory. Examples
for which experimental geometries were not found in the literature,
the global minimum in energy conformation was assumed to be one matching
qualitative steric reasoning and in some cases, geometries of several
conformers were computed to find the lowest in energy of those considered.
In the remainder of this paper, B3LYP/6-31G(d) computations with the
SMD solvent model will be referred to as DFT for in vacuo computations and DFT-oct or DFT-olive according to the solvent being
modeled. SMD solvent descriptors for water were those included with
Gaussian 09 and Gaussian 16. Those for olive oil were added to input
files manually and are shown in Table 1.36,37 It was found that the 1-octanol
parameters from the Minnesota Solvent Descriptor Database38 lead to a systematic error of about 11 kJ/mol,
underestimating solubilities in 1-octanol compared to water when used
with G09 and G16 implementations of SMD, whereas use of the scrf =
(SMD, solvent = n-octanol) command to utilize built-in
parameters for 1-octanol removed this systematic error.

Partitioning of a solute between
solvents depends on the relative
thermodynamic stability of the solute in each solvent at constant
temperature and pressure and therefore the difference in Gibbs free
energy of the solute in each solvent, in this case, 1  Gorganico and Gwatero can be approximated using
methods of quantum chemistry and an implicit solvent model. log Kow may then be calculated according to 2  

Values of log Kow for 1-octanol–water
partitions and log Kvow for olive oil–water
partitions from computational results were calculated by eqs 1 and 2. Equation 2 was likewise used
to convert log Kow values from the literature
to ΔGowo to compare with the computed ΔGowo. The computational neural network program ALOGPS 2.118 accessed online16,17 was used to
compute log Kow values in two ways that
in some cases gave different results: (1) using the SMILES descriptor
found on PubChem32 and (2) using the DFT-optimized
geometry in .mol2 format.

A second aspect of this work was the
comparison of computed log Kow values
and those from the literature to terminal
elimination half-life. An effort was made to use consistent terminal
elimination half-life, that is, healthy adult human subjects given
oral dosage not in combination with other drugs and not after repeated
dosing. When terminal elimination half-life for human subjects were
not available, those for rats were converted to estimated elimination
half-life for humans.39 Literature log Kow values were experimental where available
but otherwise, computed estimates available in the literature were
used and software specified.

The terminal elimination half-life
is defined as the time required
for the blood plasma concentration of the drug to decrease by half
after a pseudo-equilibrium (steady-state) distribution has been reached.40 This definition in terms of a pseudo-equilibrium
property is the basis for expecting a clear relationship between terminal t1/2 and log Kow which
is based on ΔGowo. In cases for which the simplest one-compartment
pharmacokinetic behavior applies, the terminal elimination half-life
is based on the unbound steady-state distribution volume, Vd,ss,u, and the unbound clearance, CLu. 3  Vd,ss,u is the
volume required to contain the total steady-state amount of the drug
at concentration equal to its steady-state unbound blood concentration,
and CLu is a proportionality constant relating the rate
of elimination to the total amount of drug in circulation.41

The rate constant, k,
is for the overall terminal
stage first-order process of elimination. Broccatelli et al. (2018)
identify a selection of terminal half-life efficient molecular structural
modifications which increase both Vd,ss,u and CLu with lipophilicity.41 Where one value of k is appropriate for a series
of drugs, a consistent value for Vd,ss,u/CLu is implied.

We use a simple pharmacokinetic
model to interpret linear relationships
between terminal t1/2 and log Kow. The drug in a lipophilic environment is Do, in an aqueous environment, Dw, and the drug after a rate-determining elimination process
step is Delim. According to the definition
of terminal elimination half-life, Dw has
a steady-state concentration, [Dw]. According
to the simplest possible pharmacokinetic model, elimination in the
terminal phase is first order. 4  with [Do] ≈
[D] for highly lipophilic drugs, elimination from
the aqueous phase is much slower than equilibration of the drug between
lipophilic and aqueous environments, and using the steady-state approximation 5  

Substituting k into
the expression for t1/2 from first-order
kinetics 6  

In cases where this linear
relationship between t1/2 and log Kow holds, we
expect slope = ln(10) × intercept and kelim in the context of this simple model to be kelim=(ln(2)ln(10))/slope.

Linear least squares analysis
and 95% certainty ranges were calculated
using the LINEST function from MS-Excel and predictions of log Kow and terminal elimination half-lives for experimental
drugs were made according to eq 7 with student t0.95,n–2 from MS-EXCEL42 Unless
stated otherwise, computed error ranges are 95% certainty ranges. 7  

Outliers in plots of log Kow versus
terminal elimination half-life were identified according to their
standardized residuals, ei*, calculated according
to eq 8, where ά
is the standard error, ei is residual for point i, and hi is leverage. 8  

Standardized residuals for outliers were typically
several times
greater than those for other data points and consistent across regressions
using all sources of log Kow. Outliers
were most clearly distinguished for the log Kow from DFT-oct and because our focus was the application of
this method, these data were used to select outliers where there was
less distinction using other sources of log Kow.

Results
Accurate optimized geometries are important
to results that follow,
hence, comparison to literature geometries are presented first. To
evaluate the accuracy and systematic errors in computed transfer free
energies, ΔGowo, computed values were compared to those calculated
from the literature, that is log Kow values,
and the mean signed error was found to be 2.3 kJ/mol. Several compounds
were found to have errors outside of a 99.9% certainty range and these
outliers will be discussed later. Computed and literature log Kow values were compared to the terminal elimination
half-life from the literature, outliers identified, and terminal elimination
half-lives estimated for the experimental drugs and for β-DHA.

Accuracy
of Computed Geometries
The endoperoxide linkage
is known to be a requirement for the antimalarial activity of artemisinin
drugs. Its bond lengths, angles, and torsional angle are sensitive
to correct ring conformations, so comparison of these to experimental
values is evidence of correct computed geometries. Endoperoxide bond
lengths and angles for artemisinin, β-arteether, and β-DHA
are compared to those from X-ray crystal structures from the literature
in Table S1 in the Supporting Information and show strong agreement. Endoperoxide bond lengths and angles
for α-arteether and α-DHA are also included. To our knowledge,
X-ray structures for α-DHA have not been reported in the literature.
These bond lengths and angles are close to those for β-arteether
and β-DHA, perhaps indicating that differences in antimalarial
activity are not due to chemical reactivity of the endoperoxide group
but to differences in physical properties such as lipophilicity.

Bond lengths and angles for optimized geometries of the most stable
conformer for quinine and quinidine, cis γ open (3), match those for similar computations in the literature
for these drugs, which is in agreement with NMR studies in solution.
The torsional angles given in Table S2 are
most relevant to this lowest energy conformation. Also see the atom
numbering scheme for quinine and quinidine in Figure 5.

Computed ΔGowo Compared to ΔGowo Based on
the Literature log Kow
Comparison
of ΔGowo computed using DFT-oct to ΔGowo calculated
from the literature log Kow values using eq 2 gives an indication of
the accuracy of these computations (see Table 2). The ΔGowo values DFT-oct
are mostly not as negative as those calculated from log Kow from the literature, that is, they underestimate solubility
in 1-octanol compared to water. Mean unsigned errors expected from
the use of the SMD solvent model vary with the functional group.35 For example, for SMD used with B3LYP/6-31G(d),
water–organic transfer free energies for aromatic N-heterocycles
and bifunctional H, C, N compounds are 3.0 and 3.6 kJ mol–1, respectively.35 The mean unsigned error
for the results in Table 2 is 3.7 kJ mol–1. Piperaquine, amodiaquine,
and lumefantrine R and S enantiomers
have errors that do not fall within a 99.9% certainty range and will
be discussed later.

Predicted log Kow for
experimental
antimalarial drugs and for diastereomers for which assignment of log Kow, to our knowledge, is not available, are
shown in Table 3. The
log Kow for artelinic acid has been predicted
using other computational methods; BioLoom gives 4.51,46 PubChem52 gives an
XLogP3-AA53 value of 4.1, and ALOGPS 2.1
gives 3.79 when artelinic acid’s SMILES descriptor is used
as input and 2.06 when artelinic acid’s DFT-optimized geometry
is submitted in .mol2 format (see Table 4). Experimental and computed log Kow reported in the literature do not distinguish
between α- and β-isomers of arteether (see Table 4). The α-and β-isomers
of arteether and DHA have different pharmacokinetics and antimalarial
activity reflecting their different structures and different lipophilicity.
The log Kow for individual isomers may
accordingly be useful. Predictions of these are in Table 3.

Comparison to Terminal Elimination Half-Life
Computed
and literature, log Kow and log Kvow, values are compared with elimination half-life
for each drug in Table 4. Terminal elimination half-life was not available for β-DHA,
F1-DHA, F2-DHA, Avery 14, and Avery 17. Amodiaquine
is quickly converted in vivo to desethyl amodiaquine,
so, elimination half-life given for it is either short and reflects
this chemical conversion or long and reflects the pharmacokinetics
of desethyl amodiaquine.59 Artesunic acid in vivo is quickly hydrolyzed to DHA.59 Artemether’s steady-state plasma levels reflect
its rapid conversion to DHA in patients and healthy subjects dosed
orally.56 The steady-state plasma concentrations
of arteether, on the other hand, are high compared to its metabolite
DHA.66 Amodiaquine, artesunic acid, and
artemether have steady-state plasma concentrations reflecting their
relatively fast chemical conversion and therefore their log Kow values cannot be expected to be as good an
indicator of their terminal elimination half-life as drugs that are
either converted to their metabolites less rapidly or to a lesser
extent. Amodiaquine, artesunic acid, and artemether are therefore
not included in the linear least squares analysis to be discussed
next.

Linear least square regressions of log Kow from DFT-oct, log Kow (lit),
log Kow from ALOGPS 2.1, and log Kvow from DFT-olive versus elimination half-life
were made. Omission of worst outliers for the log Kow from DFT-oct versus terminal elimination half-life
regressions for each consecutive regression resulted in statistical
outliers being removed in the following order: piperaquine, pyronaridine,
mefloquine, chloroquine, and desethyl amodiaquine. Piperaquine was
a strong outlier regardless of the source of log Kow. Subsequent choice of the worst outlier was not necessarily
clear for log Kvow (olive oil–water)
regressions; however, the compounds omitted based on log Kow regressions also improved the olive oil–water
log Kvow linear fits markedly. The compounds
omitted were all quinoline-based antimalarial drugs and pyronaridine
which has strong structural similarities to the quinoline-based drugs.
It is interesting that quinine and quinidine have much different elimination
half-life than the other quinoline-based drugs. The remaining drugs
were artemisinin-based drugs, quinine and quinidine, and lumefantrine,
that is, artemisinin drugs and amino alcohols. Linear regression results
for the remaining ten compounds, artemisinin, α-DHA, β-DHA,
α-arteether, β-arteether, artelinic acid, quinine, quinidine,
and R and S enantiomers of lumefantrine are shown in Table 5.

The computed log Kvow for olive oil–water

between slope and intercept is close to the prediction based on the
simple kinetic model presented in the Methods section. The certainty range for the slope, 9.21–10.97, is
within the 95% certainty range of the intercept multiplied by ln(10),
that is 1.04–17.15 h. Calculated from the slope, kelim = 0.158 ± 0.014 h–1. The plot

When log Kow values for quinoline-based
drugs and pyronaridine are compared to their terminal elimination
half-life, the resulting relationships are not nearly as strong. Piperaquine
has an exceptional standardized deviation for the linear least squares
analysis using computational log Kow but
not the literature log Kow, and this is
reflected in the higher R2 and F values when the literature log Kow values are used. For piperaquine, desethyl amodiaquine,
quinine, quinidine, mefloquine, chloroquine, and pyronaridine, log Kow values from DFT-oct and from the literature
show a stronger linear relationship than log Kow from ALOGPS 2.1 and log Kvow from DFT-olive. See Table 7. The relationship between slope and intercept for log Kvow versus terminal t1/2 is closer to what one would expect based on eq 6, in the Methods section,
than for log Kow versus t1/2. The certainty range for the slope, 110–250
h is within the certainty range of the intercept multiplied by ln(10),
−160 to 390 h. Calculated from the slope, kelim = 0.014 ± 0.012 h–1.

Discussion
Outliers
The compounds found to be outliers need to
be considered and explained in the context of the methods used. The
DFT-oct transfer free energies, ΔGow, for piperaquine, amodiaquine, and lumefantrine R and S enantiomers have errors in comparison with
ΔGow calculated from experimental
log Kow outside the 99.9% certainty range
of errors for the compounds considered in this work. Kolář
et al. (2013) recognized two reasons for the failure of implicit solvent
models including SMD: (1) problematic functional groups and (2) the
molecule is large and flexible.21 Piperaquine,
lumefantrine, and amodiaquine have similar functionality as the other
compounds. Piperaquine and lumefantrine are the largest molecules
studied here with 69 and 67 atoms, respectively, and with 6 and 9
rotatable21 bonds. Amodiaquine with 47
atoms and 5 rotatable bonds is structurally and functionally similar
to desethyl amodiaquine with 41 atoms and 4 rotatable bonds, which
falls within the certainty range indicating the larger error for amodiaquine
to be due to its greater number of atoms and rotatable bonds. It may
be tempting according to qualitative notions of conformational entropy
to estimate improved ΔGow based
on the number of known stable conformers but attempts to improve SMD
through an ensemble of conformers has been shown to not lead to marked
improvement.21 Perhaps this is because
the inclusion of entropic effects in implicit solvent models is not
well defined in terms of effects known to influence entropy in explicit
solvation models. Although the outliers in comparison to ΔGow from DFT-oct give insight into the applicability
of the SMD model, outliers in the linear regression of log Kow versus terminal t1/2 reflect differences in in vivo behavior of the
drugs considered.

The outliers identified in the plots of log Kow versus terminal elimination half-life served
to identify two different linear relationships between log Kow and terminal t1/2, one involving artemisinin drugs, amino alcohols (excluding mefloquine),
and lumefantrine and the other involving 4-amino quinolines, mefloquine,
and pyronaridine (see Figure 7). The trend lines shown in Figure 7 both include quinine and quinidine. To understand
the difference between these two groups of compounds, it is useful
to consider protein binding.

vs terminal t1/2 with two linear relationships
shown identified
by analysis of outliers.

Differences in Protein
Binding
The result that artemisinin
and amino alcohol drugs trend together for log Kow versus terminal elimination half-life and quinoline drugs
trend together may be due to differences in protein binding and, in
the case of chloroquine, a larger distribution volume.

Piperaquine
does not trend with artemisinin and amino alcohol drugs in log Kow versus terminal elimination half-life even
when experimental log Kow values from
the literature are used, but it is not an outlier when only quinoline
drugs are compared. This may be due to the strong binding of quinoline
compounds to α1-acid glycoprotein. Piperaquine is
more than 99% bound by plasma proteins and has 8 times more binding
to α1-acid glycoprotein than to human serum albumin.68 Lumefantrine, in contrast, binds primarily to
high-density lipoproteins, HDL.69 Quinoline-based
antimalarial drugs, amodiaquine, primaquine, tafenoquine, quinacrine,
and mefloquine have high binding to α1-acid glycoprotein
with binding constants in the range of Ka = 105 to 106.70 Interestingly, chloroquine, unlike the other 4-aminoquinoline drugs,
is not found to bind significantly with α1-acid glycoprotein.70 Ofori-Adjei et al. found (+) and (−)
enantiomers of chloroquine to be 34.5 and 47.5% bound to α1-acid glycoprotein, respectively.71 Chloroquine’s long terminal elimination half-life is not
due to high plasma protein binding but to its large apparent distribution
volume.72 Amino alcohols, quinine, and
quinidine bind less strongly to α1-acid glycoprotein
than mefloquine which is also an amino alcohol; quinine’s α1-acid glycoprotein binding constant is Ka = 9.12 ± 0.73, and it is 85–95% protein bound,
whereas quinidine is 70–80% protein bound.73 Mefloquine is 98% protein bound in both patients and healthy
volunteers,49 in accordance with its greater
dipole moment and its strong binding to α1-acid glycoprotein.70,74,75

Quinine and quinidine trend
with both artemisinin drugs, including
lumefantrine, and with other quinoline drugs perhaps due to their
similar plasma protein binding to artemisinin-based drugs. DHA protein
binding is higher in plasma from patients (93%), than in healthy volunteers
(88% Vietnamese and 91% Caucasians).76,77 It is typical
for α1-acid glycoprotein levels to be higher in malaria
patients than healthy subjects. Artesunic acid is 73–81% protein
bound in rats and humans.78 Artemether
is 95–98% protein bound but only 33% bound to α1-acid glycoprotein.69 Terminal phase plasma
concentrations of artemether are accompanied by its metabolite, DHA.56 This indicates that artemether’s terminal
elimination half-life not only depends on its lipophilicity and protein
binding but its chemical conversion to DHA. Arteether was found to
be 73.4–81.8% in 11 healthy male subjects with about 20 times
greater binding affinity to α1-acid glycoprotein
than to albumin.79

When log Kow is plotted against elimination
half-life, lumefantrine, quinine, quinidine, and the artemisinin-based
drugs trend together. This is likely due to stronger binding of the
4-aminoquinoline drugs primarily to α1-acid glycoprotein
and, in the case of chloroquine, large distribution volume. Lumefantrine,
although highly fat soluble, does not trend with the 4-aminoquinoline
drugs because it binds primarily to high-density lipoproteins.

Terminal
Elimination Half-Life Versus log Kvow
The linear relationship between terminal
elimination half-life and log Kvow for
artemisinin drugs, quinine and quinidine, and lumefantrine, is particularly
strong, R2 = 0.985 and F = 467 (see Table 5). The slope and intercept follow the relationship expected according
to the simple kinetic model presented in the Methods section, intercept × ln(10) = slope, and this is not the case
for the other log Kow versus t1/2 regressions in Table 5. An elimination rate constant, kelim, in the context of this model can be computed based on
the slope and/or intercept. Although all of the slopes in Table 5 make similar predictions
for kelim, the plot of log Kvow and t1/2 is the only one
with an intercept that seems meaningful. Perhaps the strong linear
relationship and agreement between the intercept and pharmacokinetic
model are evidence that predictions made regarding solubility in olive
oil, which is a biological fat, are more relevant for comparison to in vivo properties, such as terminal elimination half-life.
The results are analogous for log Kvow and t1/2 for the quinoline compounds
but the linear fit is much weaker, so the computed kelim has a much wider certainty range. Equation 6 and the simple pharmacokinetic
model from which it is derived indicated two contributing factors
to terminal half-life, the hydrophobic/hydrophilic partitioning of
the drug and the rate of elimination of the drug from aqueous environment.
The rate constant, kelim, is for the elimination
from aqueous environment. It is predicted to be smaller for quinoline
drugs, and this may be due to different renal and hepatic elimination
processes and their greater plasma protein binding in particular to
α1-acid glycoprotein which does not have a strong
linear correlation with lipophilicity.75

Lumefantrine, log Kow, and Bioavailability
There is a wide range of terminal elimination half-life values
reported for lumefantrine in the literature.80 Lefèvre and Thomsen (1999) find the lumefantrine terminal
elimination half-life to be 71.3 h (fed) and 35.1 h (fasted) and that
lumefantrine’s bioavailability increases 16 times when it is
administered in conjunction with food.64 Piperaquine by contrast shows little change in terminal elimination
half-life depending on whether subjects are fed or fasted.81 Lumefantrine’s high predicted log Kow and log Kvow are
suggestive of lumefantrine’s solubility with dietary fats which
helps to increase its terminal elimination half-life and strong binding
to HDL proteins.

Diastereomers
The diastereomers
α- and β-arteether
have different physical and pharmacokinetic properties and slightly
different antimalarial activity. To our knowledge, different log Kow values for α- and β-arteether
are not available in the literature. The greater predicted log Kow for β-arteether compared to α-arteether,
3.84 compared to 3.42 (Table 3), is consistent with the terminal elimination half-life of
31.17 h for β-arteether and 13.24 h for α-arteether.57 The greater lipophilicity of β-arteether
is understandable according to its smaller dipole moment, 1.79 D compared
to 2.84 D for α-arteether, both computed using DFT. This difference
in dipole moment can be understood according to the difference in
geometry. The C10 ethyl ether in β-arteether points
in the opposite direction to the endoperoxide partially canceling
the molecular dipole moment (see Figure 8). The influence between the orientation
of C10 substituents with respect to the endoperoxide group
in artemisinin drugs and dipole moment and the correlation of this
with greater neurotoxicity with smaller dipole moment was pointed
out by Bhattacharjee and Karle (1999).82

Figure 8 β-arteether
DFT-optimized geometry. C6-O2 endoperoxide and
C10-OEt bond dipoles point in opposite
directions partially cancelling the molecular dipole moment. Atom
numbering is the same as in Figure 2.

The α- and β-diastereomers
of arteether have similar
antimalarial activity against strains of Plasmodium
berghei in rodents but slightly different activity
depending on the strain with β-arteether being slightly more
active.83 β-arteether is also found
to be slightly more active against Plasmodium cynomolgi malaria in monkeys, whereas β-arteether and α/β-arteether
(30:70) mixture have similar activity against P. falciparum malaria in humans and similar toxic side effects during therapy.84 The slightly greater activity of β-arteether
may be due to its greater lipophilicity and smaller dipole moment
allowing it to pass through the erythrocyte cell membrane more effectively,
assuming it has not already been converted to its metabolite, DHA.19

DHA is the active metabolite of some of
the most widely used artemisinin-based
antimalarial drugs. Artesunic acid is converted to the active metabolite,
DHA most quickly followed by artemether and then arteether. The pharmacokinetics,
antimalarial activity, and toxicity of DHA are therefore relevant
to the behavior of the most widely used artemisinin derivatives. Diastereomers,
α- and β-DHA, interconvert in solution and so, the properties
of each are important to consider. Haynes et al. (2006) report log Kow of the two DHA epimers in solution to be
2.35 and 2.73 but do not specify the respective values for α
and β-DHA.14 According to DFT-oct,
log Kow = 2.11 for α-DHA and 2.53
for β-DHA, which is evidence that the more lipophilic log Kow found by Haynes et al. corresponds to β-DHA,
consistent with its smaller dipole moment, 1.582 D, compared to 3.147
D for α-DHA, according to DFT.

DHA has a labile stereocenter
at C10. D’Acquarica
et al. (2010) report that solid-state DHA consists of β-DHA
only, whereas α- and β-DHA interconversion rates in solution
depend on buffer, pH, and solvent polarity.85 They report that the Gibbs free energy of activation for HPLC on-column
epimerization from α-DHA to β-DHA, ΔGα→β⧧,o, is slightly higher than the reverse, ΔGβ→α⧧,o, based on van’t Hoff plots
and find the difference to be entropic which they believe suggests
a ring-opening mechanism.85 These relative
free energies of activation imply higher concentrations of α-DHA
than β-DHA at equilibrium, which is found to be the case in
50% v/v ethanol/water solution and 50% v/v acetonitrile/water solution.76 Batty et al. (2004) found plasma α-DHA/β-DHA
ratios in vivo to favor α-DHA of 6.3 ±
0.9 in patients with falciparum malaria,
6.9 ± 0.8 in patients with vivax malaria, 6.9 ± 0.6 in healthy
Vietnamese volunteers, and 5.4 ± 0.8 in healthy Caucasian volunteers.76 The greater dipole moment of α-DHA may
imply it to be more strongly bound to α1-acid glycoprotein.75 If α-DHA has higher protein binding, more
unbound α-DHA would be formed from unbound β-DHA to maintain
the equilibrium unbound in plasma according to Le Chatelier’s
principle and increase the overall ratio of α to β-DHA
in plasma.

Single-point computations based on the in
vacuo optimized geometries of α- and β-DHA predict
β-DHA
to be more stable in the gas phase, in water, in 1-octanol, and in
olive oil. To test the effect of geometrical relaxation in solution
and thermal enthalpies and entropies on relative stability, α-
and β-DHA geometries were optimized in each solvent and frequency
calculations performed in order to identify a minimum in energy with
all positive real vibrational frequencies and to yield thermal corrections
to enthalpy as well as entropy in each solvent. The thermally corrected
results which included entropic effects correctly predicted the greater
thermodynamic stability of α-DHA in water with ΔGβ→αo = −0.344 kJ mol–1, ΔHβ→αo = 0.869 kJ mol–1,
and ΔSβ→αo = 4.07 J mol–1 K–1 at 298.15
K. The greater entropy at 298.15 K of α-DHA in water than β-DHA
outweighs the more negative enthalpy of β-DHA, which is not
completely overcome by the fact that α-DHA is more polar. These
computations also give heat capacities, CV, and with them ΔGβ→αo, ΔHβ→αo, and ΔSβ→αo can be approximated at 310.15 K yielding ΔGβ→αo = −0.393 kJ mol–1, ΔHβ→αo = 0.880 kJ mol–1, and ΔSβ→αo = 4.103 J mol–1 K–1. The Boltzmann population of α-DHA in water at 310.15 K is
predicted to be 54% giving α-DHA/β-DHA ratio of 1.17,
correctly favoring but also underestimating the apparent greater relative
stability of α-DHA in an aqueous environment. The greater ratio
of α- to β-DHA in plasma may also be increased by stronger
binding of α-DHA to α1-acid glycoprotein as
discussed in the previous paragraph. Similar computations with 1-octanol
and olive oil as the solvents show greater computed entropy of α-DHA
than β-DHA in water compared to these other solvents, which
is due to low-frequency vibrations involving the −OH group
and DHA fused ring systems and lower computed enthalpy presumably
due to stronger dipole–dipole interactions with the greater
polarity of α-DHA. The difference in predicted entropy is less
in 1-octanol and in olive oil, ΔGβ→αo = 2.83, ΔHβ→αo = 3.76 kJ mol–1, ΔSβ→αo = 3.13 J mol–1 K–1, in 1-octanol and ΔGβ→αo = 5.12,
ΔHβ→αo = 5.87 kJ mol−1 and
ΔSβ→αo = 2.45 J mol−1 K−1 in olive oil. β-DHA is predicted to be more
stable than α-DHA in octanol and olive oil at 310.15 K.

Quinine and quinidine, also diastereomers, show difference in antimalarial
activity; quinidine shows twice the antimalarial activity as quinine
against P. falciparum.19 Inspection of Figure 5 reveals that they differ from being mirror images
only in the position of the quinuclidine vinyl group. Warhurst et
al. (2003) report log Kow values of 3.17
and 2.84 for quinine and quinidine, respectively, but also cite Tsai
et al. (1993) as giving 2.64 for quinine and 2.88 for quinidine. Our
computations agree with the latter predicting log Kow to be greater for quinidine than for quinine. The shorter
terminal elimination half-life for quinidine, that is, 6.09 h compared
to 12.34 h for quinine then does not follow the general trend of increased
elimination half-life with increased lipophilicity. The longer elimination
half-life of quinine can be explained by the greater protein binding
of quinine (85–95%) compared to quinidine (70–80%).73 If quinidine is indeed less lipophilic than
quinine, it is interesting that it has less protein binding. Urien
et al. (1995) in their study of the binding of eight drugs to α1-acid glycoprotein found that ΔGbind does not have a strong correlation with physicochemical
parameters including log Kow.75 On considering ΔHbind and TΔSbind independently, they found strong linear relationships of each with
log Poct-hep = log Kow – log Khw, where Khw is the heptane–water partition coefficient.75 ΔHbind becomes
more negative with increased log Poct-hep and −TΔSbind less negative.75 The log Poct-hep parameter is a measure of dipole–dipole
interaction between the solute and octanol.75 The greater protein binding of quinine compared to quinidine may
be due to greater dipole moment, that is 2.74 D for quinine compared
to 2.46 D for quinidine both in vacuo according to
DFT. The computed log Poct-hep values
also show the same trend, log Poct-hep = 2.74 for quinine and 2.46 for quinidine, coincidentally the same
magnitudes as their dipole moments. This is for the most stable conformer
of each which is also the most lipophilic. Given that quinine and
quinidine have nearly equal % β-haemitin inhibition, perhaps
quinidine’s greater antimalarial activity is due to its greater
lipophilicity leading to better penetration through the erythrocyte
cell membrane.19

Given the structural
similarity between quinine and quinidine,
the differences in their properties are quite interesting. Although
one might expect the difference in position of the quinuclidine vinyl
group to cause differences in rotational accessibility of the conformers,
Zaera et al. (2009) found little difference in the energy and accessibility
of cinchonidine and cinchonine conformers formed by rotations around
τ1 and τ2 (Table S2) and attribute solubility differences between these and
analogous cinchona compounds such as quinidine and quinine to differences
in vibrational entropy mostly accounted for in the most stable conformer
of each compound and resulting from the change in center of mass with
different position of this vinyl substituent.20 The difference in computed entropies they found showed agreement
with the temperature dependence of their experimentally determined
solubilities. Hoping to clarify the relative lipophilicities of quinine
and quinidine and to test the effects of solvent specific geometry
relaxation in each solvent and differences in entropy and thermally
corrected enthalpy, quinine and quinidine geometries were optimized
in water, 1-octanol, and olive oil and vibrational frequency analysis
was performed, confirming that a minimum in energy had been found
and yielding thermally corrected free energies, enthalpies, entropies,
and heat capacities at 298.15 K and allowing those at 310.15 K to
be predicted based on the computed heat capacities. Results are given
in Table 8.

a Transfer entropies
(J mol–1 K–1), enthalpies (kJ
mol–1),
Gibbs free energies (kJ mol–1 K–1), and log Kow and log Kvow of quinine and quinidine at 310.15 K.

The increase in entropy for quinidine
going from water to 1-octanol
or olive oil while the transfer entropy of quinine is negative is
interesting and results from differences in vibrational entropy in
each solvent. The predicted effects at 298.15 and 310.15 K do not
change the trend in lipophilicity. With the effects of thermal enthalpies
and entropies included, both compounds are predicted to increase relative
solubility in water with increased temperature. Quinidine is still
predicted to be more lipophilic according to its more positive log Kow and log Kvow values
presented in Table 8.

Estimates of Terminal Elimination Half-Life
The strong
linear relationships found between log Kow and terminal elimination half-life indicate the close relationship
between terminal t1/2 and relative thermodynamic
stability in octanol or olive oil compared to water, ΔGowo or ΔGvowo, for drugs that trend together. Assuming similar
plasma protein binding, rates of metabolism, and relationships between
distribution volume and clearance for structurally similar drugs,
these linear relationships allow estimation of terminal elimination
half-life for experimental antimalarial drugs. As mentioned above,
the predominant DHA diastereomer in plasma was found to be α-DHA.76 The DHA terminal half-life of 1.86 h given by
Jitamala et al. (2015)55 may reflect primarily
the properties of α-DHA and the predicted β-DHA half-life
of 6 h may be of interest. The smaller dipole moment and greater lipophilicity
of β-DHA may allow it easier penetration through the erythrocyte
cell membrane and greater antimalarial activity at the same time as
greater neurotoxicity. The predicted higher log Kow for β-arteether than α-arteether matches
β-arteether’s longer terminal elimination half-life.

Avery et al. (2002) report terminal half-life in rats of Avery-17
to be 73 min and that for Avery-14 to be less than this.12 Using log Kow =
5.69 from Table 3 and t1/2 = 1.22 h in eq 6 from Sarver et al. (1997)39 predicts a half-life of 5.72 h in humans, which is surprisingly
low, given the alkyl/aryl substitution of these compounds and their
high lipophilicity. An abnormally low terminal elimination half-life
could be explained based on abnormally low volume of distribution, Vd,ss,u. Avery et al. suggest that the lower
apparent terminal half-life of Avery-14 compared to Avery-17 may be
due to structural features of these compounds but also suggest that
the cause may be lower plasma concentrations for Avery-14 that reflect
a distribution phase rather than a true terminal phase.12 Computed dipole moments for Avery-14 and Avery-17
are 4.41 and 4.86 D, respectively. Perhaps analogous to quine and
quinidine, Avery-17 has greater α1-acid glycoprotein
binding and longer terminal t1/2 compared
to Avery-14 which is more lipophilic. The greater potency of Avery-17,
according to our optimized geometries may be explained by a slightly
more obstructed endoperoxide group in Avery-14. The results here suggest
that if factors determining pharmacokinetics for Avery-14 and Avery-17
are similar to other artemisinin drugs, they have considerably longer
terminal elimination half-life. Avery-14 and Avery-17 are predicted
to be highly lipophilic in agreement with their large predicted log Kow values given in Table 3. Avery et al. note that these compounds
have high potency but low bioavailability due to poor solubility.
The predicted terminal elimination half-lives of 48 and 45 h, respectively,
for Avery-14 and Avery-17, if accurate, may be in an appropriate range
to counter the altered life cycle of resistant strains and perhaps
would be less likely to trigger resistance and neurotoxicity if they
do not have DHA as an active metabolite.

F1-DHA is
found to have higher lipophilicity than F2-DHA in agreement
with their log Koct:Ringer but perhaps
the estimated log Kow values
in Table 3 allow them
to be considered in a consistent context with other antimalarial drugs.
The C10 fluoroalkyl group of F1-DHA presents
an obstacle to transfer across the intestinal lining, so the estimated
terminal elimination half-life given in Table 6 is likely not of much interest. The predicted
terminal elimination half-life of F2-DHA, which is 10 h,
is similar to those for DHA, artemether, and arteether, drugs with
greater possible neurotoxicity and perhaps greater vulnerability to
artemisinin-resistant malaria because their active metabolite, DHA,
may trigger the dormant ring stage.5

Summary and Conclusions
The results here show that quantum
chemical log Kow values from DFT with
the SMD implicit solvent model
have a strong linear relationship with the terminal elimination half-life
for drugs used in antimalarial ACT therapies and experimental antimalarial
drugs. This relationship follows a simple pharmacokinetic model, and
the results modeling olive oil as a solvent match the predicted relationship
between the slope and intercept, which is perhaps an indication that
olive oil as a biological fat is more appropriate than 1-octanol in
comparison to these in vivo drug properties. The
predicted log Kow values for 21 antimalarial
drugs based on computed water to 1-octanol underestimate the relative
stability in 1-octanol by a mean of value of 2.3 kJ mol–1 and show a mean unsigned
error of 3.7 kJ mol–1, which is in good agreement
with the literature mean unsigned error values for compounds with
similar functionalities. Errors are larger for larger molecules with
more rotatable bonds consistent with the work of Kolář
et al. (2013).21 In plots of log Kow versus terminal t1/2, artemisinin and amino alcohol-based drugs were found to trend together
and 4-aminoquinoline compounds are found to trend with mefloquine
and pyronaridine, consistent with the protein binding of these different
families of compounds. The linear fit with olive oil as the modeled
solvent allows terminal elimination half-lives to be estimated for
β-DHA and five experimental antimalarial drugs. An advantage
of the methodology used here is that the physical properties of compounds
with subtle but important geometric differences can be distinguished
as demonstrated by the three sets of diastereomers studied. Computed
differences between α and β-arteether correlate with their
different t1/2 and allow for interpretation
of their slightly different antimalarial activity. Computed lipophilicities
for α and β-DHA allow experimentally determined log Kow to be assigned for them. The α diastereomer
of DHA is found to be favored in aqueous media, and this is understood
in terms of its greater entropy in water. Solubilities of quinine
and quinidine are also found to be sensitive thermal effects of thermal
enthalpy and entropy in different solvents. The experimental antimalarial
drugs studied in this work were previously designed for longer t1/2 and lower neurotoxicity. It is suggested
based on their estimated terminal elimination half-lives that their
properties or properties of similar drugs may also be conducive to
addressing the problem of ACT-resistant strains based on the resistant
strains’ altered developmental stages.
