We report on the enhancement and
modulation of nonlinear optical
response in an Nd:Y3Al5O12 (Nd:YAG)
laser crystal through embedded silver nanoparticles (NPs) fabricated
by Ag+ ion implantation. The linear absorption spectrum
of the sample clearly reveals a localized surface plasmon resonance
(SPR) band from 350 to 700 nm correlated to the Ag NPs. By using the
Z-scan technique with femtosecond pulses at a wavelength of 515 nm,
which is considered as an optical excitation within the SPR band,
the nonlinear refraction index reaches values as high as ∼10–12 cm2/W, enhanced by ∼4 orders of
magnitude in comparison to that of unimplanted Nd:YAG (without Ag
NPs). In addition, it has been shown that embedded Ag NPs in the Nd:YAG
host reveal saturable absorption signifying the nonlinear responses.
We have also observed that the nonlinear absorption coefficients depend
significantly on the excitation energy and can be modulated by varying
the fluence of Ag+ ions.

1 Introduction
Noble metallic nanostructures
embedded in a transparent dielectric
matrix are of growing interest due to their large third-order optical
nonlinearities ascribed to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and
the quantum size effect.1,2 With the purpose of
avoiding reunion and formation of the thermodynamics of bulk materials,3 noble metallic NPs can be embedded in transparent
materials by a few developed technologies, such as ion implantation4−7 and sol–gel methods.8 The ion
beam technology offers versatile solutions for materials modification
and also has been applied for the generation and synthesis of various
nanoscale structures.9 For example, by
using swift heavy ions, nanotracks can be formed inside the matrix
due to the electronic energy deposition of the incident ions onto
the target materials.10−12 Since the pioneering work by Davenas et al. in 1973,13,14 in which the synthesis of sodium and calcium NPs in ionic crystals
of LiF and MgO was realized, ion implantation has opened a promising
avenue to fabricate nanomaterials with desired properties on account
of its unique advantages, for instance, the flexibility of the types
of metals and substrates and the possibility of fabrication over a
large area in a single step and long-time sustainment without deterioration.15,16

In the recent decades, numerous studies have shown that the
significant
enhancement of optical nonlinearities,17−20 as a consequence of collective
oscillation of electron gas in metal that couples with electromagnetic
fields, makes noble metallic nanocomposites promising as optical data
recording disks, optical waveguides,21 and
all-optical switches.22−24 Different from other noble metallic NPs, silver NPs
own lower intrinsic loss of plasmonic energy at visible frequencies
that gives rise to SPR. Moreover, the SPR energy of silver NPs is
far from the interband transition energy so that analyzing the origin
of the optical nonlinearities becomes easier.25,26 In-depth researches indicate that the shape of the metallic NPs
and their dielectric environment determine the surface frequency and
the nonlinear optical (NLO) properties consequently.27−31 Thus, the size, the volume fraction of metal NPs, and the substrate
play an essential role in SPR processing.

As one of the major
gain media for solid-state laser systems, Nd:YAG
possesses superior fluorescence properties, a high damage threshold,
and a relatively high emission cross-section.32 In addition to the main applications of bulk lasers, a number of
works have been realized based on rare-earth ion-doped YAG, for example,
for optical waveguides,33−35 signal amplification,36 and so on. The NPs in this gain medium may be
of potential applications because they offer the possibility of a
combination of NLO responses and lasing. In this work, we report on
the fabrication of silver nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in Nd:YAG crystals
by using ion implantation. We observe an efficient modulation of the
NLO response. The morphology of the NPs has been investigated by transmission
electron microscopy. In accordance with the result calculated by using
the Mie theory, an absorption spectrum has been obtained
as well, which indicates the controllable SPR effect obviously. Furthermore,
the third-order optical nonlinearities of these samples, including
nonlinear absorption and nonlinear refraction, were investigated through
the Z-scan setup with femtosecond (fs) pulses at 515 nm, which is
located in the SPR band (Figure 1).

2 Results and Discussion
The simulation of the ion-implantation process with a hundred thousand
numbers of Ag+ ions is displayed in Figure 2, which is calculated by the software of
SRIM. The 2D depth plot is shown in red, and the lateral plot is depicted
in green. As we can see, the density of incident ions in the bulk
presents a Gauss-like distribution characteristic with a half-width
of ∼50 nm. It is worth noting that the distribution center
of Ag+ ions is 57 nm, with a total range of around 100
nm.

Figure 2 Ag+ ion distribution as simulated by the SRIM code.

During the ion-implantation process,
the implanted ion will be
randomly embedded in the crystal when the concentration is below the
solubility limit. However, when the implantation dose is high and
the implanted impurity atoms are not miscible with the substrate,
these implanted atoms can aggregate to form nanoclusters. The formation
of NPs can occur already during implantation if the implanted dose
is higher than a certain threshold and if their diffusion in the substrate
is fast. If the diffusion coefficient of the impurity atoms is low
during implantation, a post-implantation annealing initiates the precipitation
of nanoclusters. In both cases, the NPs can grow and coarsen to bigger
particles with increasing impurity concentration and annealing temperature/time.
This has been well documented for many metal ions implanted in oxides,
such as Au in SiO2.37−40

Figure 3a depicts
the absorption spectrum of the Ag NPs embedded in Nd:YAG crystals.
For the sample with the highest ion fluence, the phenomenon of the
resonance interaction is obvious, whereas the absorption peak is quite
gentle for samples 3 and 4 with lower fluences. Therefore, the NLO
property study will focus on the two higher-fluence Ag+-implanted samples. As shown in Figure 3, the absorption peaks are at 497 and 505
nm for samples 2 and 1, respectively, and sample 1 performs a stronger
absorption compared to that of the other samples. It is reasonable
on the basis of previous relevant literature.41 The higher dose of implanted ions results in a larger NP size, leading
to the red shift of the absorption peak. Figure 3b is the calculation of the peak positions
of different sizes of Ag NPs by the Mie theory using the formula 1  where εm, εd, and p are the complex dielectric constants of
the metal and the insulator and the volume fraction of the metal,
respectively. εm″ and λ0 denote the imaginary part
of εm and the wavelength of light in vacuum, respectively.
In the case of SPR, εm′(ω) + 2εd′(ω) = 0, which is
just the condition for maximum absorption. As shown in Figure 3b, the peak position has a
red shift as the diameter of the NPs increases. It coincides with
our result, although the shift is a little smaller than that in the
experimental data. The reason we believe this is that the Ag NPs are
not regular during the ion-implantation processing and the shape may
not be an absolute sphere, which is essential to the absorption.

fluences; (b) the calculation of the peak of the SPR absorption (varies
with the diameter of NPs increasing) by the Mie theory.

Figure 4a shows
a cross-sectional overview bright-field transmission electron microscopy
(BF-TEM) micrograph of sample 2. Besides amorphization of an approximately
160 nm thick surface layer, Ag+ ion implantation of an
Nd:YAG crystal at a fluence of 5 × 1016 ions/cm leads
to the formation of an approximately 75 nm wide NP-containing band
centered at around 60 nm below the sample surface. The NPs are of
almost a spherical shape with a slightly varying size distribution,
as shown in the lower inset of Figure 4a. Furthermore, the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) micrograph
points to the formation of crystalline NPs. Calculating the corresponding
diffractogram by Fast Fourier Transformation gives two rings of Bragg
reflections, which can be assigned to polycrystalline silver (upper
inset of Figure 4a).
High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy
(HAADF-STEM) imaging coupled with qualitative chemical analysis by
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS), as shown in Figure 4b, confirms the observations
regarding the formation of Ag NPs.

the corresponding diffractogram of the HRTEM micrograph. (b) HAADF-STEM

Figures 5a,b
shows
the excitation pulse energy-dependent OA Z-scan results of Ag+ ion-implanted Nd:YAG crystals with the dose of 1 × 1017 and 5 × 1016 ions/cm2, respectively.
As we can see, the normalized transmittance curves exhibit symmetrical
peaks on the laser focal point (i.e., z = 0), indicating
clear saturable absorption (SA) responses in these two samples, and
the SA behavior becomes much more pronounced as the pulse energy increases. Figure 5c gives the SA response
of sample 1, sample 2, and the pure Nd:YAG crystal at an irradiance
pulse energy of 150 μJ, which exhibits the dependence on fluence
of the implanted ions. The higher-fluence Ag+-doped sample
has a larger SA response of ∼70% comparing to ∼14% for
the lower one. And it should be pointed out that we did not observe
any prominent NLO response from the pure Nd:YAG crystal. As a consequence,
the SA performances mainly originate from the Ag NPs, which can attribute
to SPR, and we can modulate the SA performances through the fluence
of the implanted ions. On the basis of the NLO theory, the propagation
equation in these samples can be written as: dI/dz′ = −α0I – αNLI2, where I is the excitation intensity, z′
is the propagation distance in the samples, α0 is
the linear absorption coefficient, and αNL is the
nonlinear absorption coefficient. This equation can be solved as follows42 2  where q0(z) = αNL(I0Leff)/(1
+ z2/z02), Leff = [1 – e–α0L]/α0, Leff is
the effective thickness of the Ag NPs layer, L is
the layer thickness of the Ag NPs, I0 is
the light intensity at the focus, and z0 is the beam’s diffraction length. By fitting
the open-aperture (OA) Z-scan results, we can obtain the αNL of these samples, and the negative value represents the
SA response (Figure 5d). It is clear that the absolute value of αNL decreases
steadily as the excitation pulse energy increases in both the 5 ×
1016 and 1 × 1017 ions/cm2 Ag+ ion-implanted Nd:YAG crystals. Furthermore, we can see the
sample with 1 × 1017 ions/cm2 Ag+-implantation possesses larger αNL than the 5 ×
1016 ions/cm2 one; for example, the coefficient
is ∼−2000 cm/GW for sample 1 at 150 nJ, whereas it is
∼−360 cm/GW for sample 2, which illustrates the superior
SA performance in the higher-fluence Ag+ ion-implanted
sample. This is consistent with the result in Figure 5c.

(b) sample 2 under
the excitation of 340 fs pulses at 515 nm with different pulse energies.

fitting results. (d) The nonlinear absorption coefficients of sample
1 and sample 2 under the excitation of different pulse energies.

Considering the possibility that
the nonlinear effects may be caused
by higher-order nonlinearities rather than third-order nonlinearities,
we plot the linear fit of the curve of ln(T(z) – 1) versus ln(I0)
(i.e., ln(T(z) – 1) as a
function of ln(I0)), where I0 is the excitation intensity at position z. If the slope of the fitting line is 1, the nonlinear phenomena
are due to the third-order nonlinearities.43 As one can see, the slopes in Figure 6a are all equal to ∼1.0 at low energies (less
than 100 nJ), whereas it reaches 1.1 at 150 nJ for the sample with
Ag+ implantation at a fluence of 5 × 1016 ions/cm2. For the sample with the fluence of 1 ×
1017 Ag+/cm2 (Figure 6b), only at an energy of 10 nJ does the slope
equal to 1, whereas at medium (50 and 100 nJ) and high energy (150
nJ), the value reaches 1.1 and 1.2, respectively. This suggests that
the higher-order nonlinearities are not ignorable for high-energy
excitation (150 nJ). In addition, comparing the results of Figure 6a,b, with a higher
fluence of the implanted Ag+ ions, it becomes easier to
excite the higher-order nonlinearities because of the higher concentration
of plasmonic NPs. In addition, we measure the sample with a fluence
of 1 × 1017 Ag+/cm2 at irradiances
6 and 8 nJ to give a supplement in the low-energy regime (see Figure 6c). The inset of
this figure is the linear fit to the plot of ln(T(z) – 1) versus ln(I0). The origin to change in transmittance of about 10% guarantees
that the results are corresponding to the third-order optical nonlinearities.
As we can see, it shows similar laws compared to the results with
higher irradiances. In this way, we can conclude that the nonlinear
effects are mainly caused by the third-order nonlinearities within
the range of the excitation energy used in this work.

1 at different pulse energies. (c) Typical OA Z-scan results and plots
of ln(T(z)–1) vs ln(I0) (inset image) of sample 1 with low irradiances.

In the meantime, we also investigate
the nonlinear refraction properties
of these samples. As we all know, the nonlinear index of refraction
is contributed to several physical mechanisms, such as electronic
polarization, Raman-induced Kerr effect, molecular orientational effects,
electrostriction, population redistribution, and thermal contributions.
The distortion of the electron cloud about an atom or molecule by
the optical field, which is involved in the electronic polarization
mechanism, is proven to be the main source of the NLO refraction of
noble metal nanocomposites.44 Note that,
during the ion-implantation process, ions interact with the surface
lattice atoms of the bulk mainly through elastic collisions, which
makes the atoms leave the initial lattice position and form the Frenkel
defects.45 In addition, higher doses lead
to more serious lattice damage, which may have a strong impact on
the self-focusing and/or self-defocusing effects, and this may be
the main reason that we did not observe a clear closed-aperture (CA)
Z-scan signal in sample 1. It is known that annealing can reduce color
centers and lattice damage effectively;46 hence, the annealing effect will be the next step in our research
plan. Figure 7 shows
the CA results of sample 2 and the pure Nd:YAG crystal under different
pulse energies, which show a valley-peak type, indicating a self-focusing
effect. The nonlinear refractive index, n2, of these samples can be obtained by fitting the CA Z-scan data
by the analytic formula47 3  where Δϕ0 = k·Δn·Leff, z0 = kω02/2,
and x = z/z0. The deduced n2 values are summarized
in Table 1, with an
error bar of approximately ±10%. From Table 1, we can see that sample 2 possesses a giant n2 reaching ∼2 × 10–12 cm2/W, which is about 4 orders of magnitude larger in
comparison to that of pure Nd:YAG with a value of ∼1.4 ×
10–16 cm2/W. This is relevant with the
fact that the former has Ag NPs, whereas the latter does not. The
SPR effect, therefore, enhances the NLO response significantly as
reported in some previous works.48−50 It should be noted that,
different from these previous works, the nonlinear refractive index
of the matrix we used is 10-fold higher than that of the ion-implanted
Ag nanoparticles embedded in silica glass.51 This proves that the nonlinear refractive index of the ion-implanted
layer is influenced not only by the implanted ions but also by the
matrix.

3 Conclusions
Using ion implantation, we have fabricated Ag
NPs embedded in an
Nd:YAG crystal, as confirmed by TEM analysis. The linear and NLO responses
have been investigated. The absorption spectrum shows the stronger
absorbance of higher-fluence Ag+ ions with the peak at
around 500 nm, which basically coincides with calculation by the Mie
theory. The NLO properties have been studied by a Z-scan system with
both open and closed apertures. The nonlinear absorption coefficient
of the sample with 5 × 1016 ions/cm2 fluence
is estimated to be −368.2 cm/GW at 150 nJ, and it increases
with the decrease in pulse energy. Moreover, the nonlinear refraction
is enhanced by 4 orders of magnitude with respect to pure Nd:YAG.
With the higher-dose implantation (1 × 1017 ions/cm2), the nonlinear absorption coefficient has over 5 times more
than that of the sample with low-fluence implantation.

4 Experimental Section
YAG crystals (purchased from ATOM OPTICS
Company) doped with 1
atom % Nd3+ ions were implanted with 200 keV Ag+ ions at four different fluences of 1 × 1017, 5 ×
1016, 3 × 1016, and 1 × 1016 ions/cm2 (samples 1–4) by analytical-type ion-implanter
LC22-1C0-01. This process generated a surface layer of embedded Ag
NPs in the bulk, which is 100 nm in thickness according to the calculation
by SRIM.52 As seen in Figure 1a, the Ag+ ion beam
was tilted by 7° off the vertical plane of the sample surface
to minimize the channeling effect.53 To
locally analyze the microstructure of the Nd:YAG crystal implanted
with Ag+ ions at a fluence of 5 × 1016 ions/cm,
TEM investigations were carried out using an image Cs-corrected
Titan 80-300 microscope (FEI) operated at an accelerating voltage
of 300 kV. Besides BF-TEM and HRTEM, atomic number contrast imaging
by HAADF-STEM was performed. For qualitative chemical analysis, EDXS
was performed with a Li-drifted silicon detector (EDAX) attached to
the Titan microscope. Before TEM analysis, the specimen mounted in
a double-tilt analytical holder was placed for 10 s into a Model 1020
Plasma Cleaner (Fischione) to remove organic contamination. A classical
cross-sectional TEM specimen was prepared by sawing, grinding, dimpling,
and final Ar ion milling. Absorption spectra were measured using a
U4100 UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer and were compared
with calculations based on the Mie theory. A typical OA and CA Z-scan
system, with the schematic shown in Figure 1b, was used to study the third-order nonlinear
optical (NLO) properties of these Ag+ ion-embedded Nd:YAG
crystals. In this technique, the transmittance through the sample
as a function of the incident laser intensity was measured as the
sample gradually moved through the focus of a lens along the laser
propagation direction (z axis). All measurements
were carried out by using 340 fs pulses from a fiber laser operating
at 515 nm, with a repetition rate of 100 Hz. The laser beam was tightly
focused through a 15 cm focal-length lens, and the beam waist radius
was estimated to be ∼15 μm at the focus. For comparison,
different input pulse energies were chosen, within the range of 6
to 150 nJ.
