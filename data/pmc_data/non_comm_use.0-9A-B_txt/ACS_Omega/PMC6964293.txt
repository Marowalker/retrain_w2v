Zinc–oxygen batteries are seen as promising energy
storage
devices for future mobile and stationary applications. Introducing
them as secondary battery is hindered by issues at both the anode
and cathode. Research efforts were intensified during the past two
decades, mainly focusing on catalyst materials for the cathode. Thereby,
zinc foil was almost exclusively used as the anode in electrochemical
testing in the lab-scale as it is easy to apply and shall yield reproducible
results. However, it is well known that zinc metal reacts with water
within the electrolyte to form hydrogen. It is not yet clear how the
evolution of hydrogen is affecting the performance results obtained
thereof. Herein, we extend the studies and the understanding about
the evolution of hydrogen at zinc by analyzing the zinc–oxygen
battery during operation. By means of electrochemical measurements,
operando gas analysis, and anode surface analysis, we elucidate that
the rate of the evolution of hydrogen scales with the current density
applied, and that the roughness of the anode surface, that is, the
pristine state of the zinc foil surface, affects the rate as well.
In the end, we propose a link between the evolution of hydrogen and
the unwanted impact on the actual electrochemical performance that
might go unnoticed during testing. Thereof, we elucidate the consequences
that arise for the working principle and the testing of materials
for this battery type.

Introduction
Metal–oxygen batteries are seen
as promising energy storage
devices and possess theoretical energy densities that can be higher
than that of lithium-ion batteries.1,2 However, their
application as electrically rechargeable battery technology—both
for aqueous metal–oxygen batteries and nonaqueous metal–oxygen
batteries—is hindered so far because fundamental and technical
challenges remain.3−6 Major drawbacks are energy efficiency, the need for purified oxygen,
as well as the poor cycle life due to electrolyte decomposition.7,8 Especially, in the case of organic Li–O2 batteries,
it is well known that high overpotentials during charge decompose
the organic electrolyte.9−11 Thereby, using operando techniques
allows better understanding the processes involved.12−17

Among the aqueous metal–oxygen batteries, the alkaline
zinc–oxygen
(Zn–O2) battery has been seen as highly promising8,18−20 but exhibits a similar, equally grave side reaction:
the evolution of hydrogen (HER) on the active material Zn occurs because
Zn is reacting with water from the alkaline aqueous electrolyte to
form hydrogen (H2) and zinc hydroxide species (Zn(OH)2)21−23 as follows 1  

Thereby, not only the solvent in the
electrolyte is consumed and
gas bubbles are formed but the precious active material Zn at the
anode is converted to an inactive, insulating material in the process.
This loss of active material ultimately leads to a severe decrease
in usable capacity. A detailed description of the working principle
of the Zn–O2 battery is provided in the Supporting Information (see reactions S1–S3).

The HER is considered since decades to be responsible for the self-discharge
of the Zn–O2 battery.24−27 Efficient strategies were developed
to suppress the HER and thus to diminish the degradation of the anode.28 The strategies aim to reduce the activity of
H2O and hence the rate of the HER, for example, by adding
inorganic and organic inhibitors to the Zn metal powder or paste or
by using metal alloys as the Zn anode.24,25,29−32 It is well known that the “HER also consumes
electrons during the charging process” (Chen et al.33) and that the electrons could rather be invested
into the HER if all ZnO is converted back to Zn.

Interestingly,
the major research focus for Zn–O2 batteries is
on cathode materials and not on the anode with its
deleterious HER and possible implications. Often new catalysts and
cathode concepts are proposed and investigated to propel the much
needed research on the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and
oxygen evolution reaction (OER).34−41 A recent benchmarking study on anode concepts for Zn–O2 batteries revealed that 65% of the published research articles
during the past 20 years used simple Zn foil anodes in lab-scale research
(21 out of 32 articles; see also Table S1 in the Supporting Information), although it is not the state-of-the-art
anode and facilitates the HER as the side reaction.42

Thus, the purpose of our study is to shed light on
the gas that
is evolved at the anode during battery testing with the commonly used
zinc foil. We aim to gain understanding about the governing factors
for the electrochemical formation of hydrogen in practically relevant
operating conditions. By means of electrochemical analysis, pressure
change measurements, and operando differential electrochemical mass
spectrometry (DEMS), we elucidate the implications for the underlying
working principle of the battery. In the end, our study might help
transfer the gained knowledge to apply improved cycling protocols
and setups for testing novel materials for the anode and cathode of
zinc–oxygen batteries.

Results and Discussion
Battery Cycling
Figure 1a shows cycling results obtained at 1.0 mA cm–2 for a fixed time limit (1 h discharge followed by 1 h charge). This
cycling procedure, known as shallow cycling, is commonly applied for
testing the performance of Zn–O2 batteries (as well
as other newly developed batteries in lab-scale; compare Table S1) but does not resemble a practical use
case. Stable cycling with flat discharge and charge plateaus for 60
cycles over the course of 120 h (the inset in Figure 1a shows the same cycling within 10 h) can
be observed. The corresponding capacity withdrawn is 0.79 mA h for
each discharge and charge.

Figure 1 Cycling data of Zn–O2 batteries
with Zn foil
as the anode: (a) at 1.0 mA cm–2 (discharge/charge
step 0.79 mA h, corresponding to a DoD of 0.09%), the inset on the
right shows the same cycling within 10 h; (b) first at 1.0 mA cm–2 and then at 5.0 mA cm–2 (discharge
step limited to 0.9 V). The charge step is not limited by a cut-off
potential so that—unintentionally—more capacity than
previously discharged might be retained during charge. (c) Uncommon
cycling protocol starting to charge a pristine, fully charged battery
at 1.0 mA cm–2, whereas a second potential plateau
above 2.00 V can be observed.

Figure 1b reveals
the cycling performance if discharge is not limited by time but rather
by potential (cut-off potential at 0.90 V). First, a Zn–O2 battery is discharged at 1.0 mA cm–2 until
the cut-off potential is reached at about 2.5 h or 2 mA h. The subsequent
charge is yielding the same amount of capacity at a stable potential
plateau of about 1.95 V, whereas a second potential plateau emerges
from there at 2 mAh (red-colored area).

Next, the cell is discharged
again. This time, the charging current
is changed to 5.0 mA cm–2. We can observe a first
potential plateau exhibiting the same capacity as the preceding discharge
with a potential value marginally higher than for 1.0 mA cm–2 and a second potential plateau which scales with the current density
applied. It is to be noted that we observe only one potential plateau
when charging a Zn–O2 battery with large excess
of the electrolyte (compare Figure S2;
charging at 10 mA cm–2 and 1 mL of electrolyte instead
of a few μL). By implication, a large excess of the electrolyte
might facilitate other, generally unwanted electrochemical processes,
shifting the potential to another plateau, that is, the second plateau.

Figure 1c shows
results obtained for a very different cycling protocol that is intentionally
chosen to evoke side reactions in the battery: A pristine—and
thus fully charged—Zn–O2 battery is charged
further at 1.0 mA cm–2. Thereby, the cell potential
increases to values around 2.20 V and is stable for approximately
1 h, corresponding to 0.79 mA h. Afterward, the battery is discharged,
achieving approximately 4.38 mA h of discharge capacity. Subsequently,
the same amount of capacity is charged at a cell potential of around
1.95 V. After 11.5 h, when the charge capacity is equal to the previously
obtained discharge capacity—the cell potential shifts to another
plateau above 2.00 V and charge continues steadily, that is, the battery
is overcharged. However, the electrons invested during charge must
stem from other reactions than the reduction of ZnO so that this mode
of operation can not be of interest because it possibly leads to the
degradation of the battery itself.

The second potential plateau
that appears during the second charging
step can also be observed if MnO2 is used as the catalyst
at the cathode instead of the perovskite-type catalyst (compare Figure S3; same cycling profile for a Zn–O2 cell with commercially available cathode). Furthermore, the
second potential plateau does not appear when discharge and charge
are limited to a certain threshold value for the cell potential (compare Figure S4; cycling between 0.90 and 2.10 V).
It remains to be an open question whether studies employing novel
catalyst materials for the cathode of Zn–O2 batteries
do reflect the true impact of the material on the electrochemistry
if tested in a two electrode setup.

Gas Analysis
To further understand the underlying processes
during charge, we monitored the pressure inside the oxygen reservoir
of a closed Zn–O2 battery and applied operando DEMS
analysis for an open cell setup. Figure 2a shows the obtained results for the operando
pressure measurement. The constant slope of pressure during discharge
is in line with the expected flat plateaus for the cell potential
and implies that O2 is consumed in the oxygen reservoir
as intended during ORR. During charge, the pressure increases almost
linearly because of the release of O2 ascribed to the OER.
However, at 3.4 mA h of charge (corresponding to ∼9 h of operation;
starting point of the charge at the second potential plateau), the
slope of the pressure β increases noticeably by a factor of
2.7 from β1 to β2, indicating that
more gas is formed during charge at the second potential plateau in
comparison to the charge at the first plateau.

Figure 2 Extended gas analytic
during cycling: (a) pressure change in a
closed cell system (during cycling at 1.0 mA cm–2). (b) Ion currents for m/z = 32
(assigned to oxygen) and m/z = 2
(assigned to hydrogen) by DEMS (during cycling at 2.5 mA cm–2; raw data in Figures S6, and S7 a). (c)
Ion currents for the same m/z values
at the OCV mode between 0 and 0.5 h, at 0% DoD, then charging further
at 2.5 mA cm–2 between 0.5 and 1.5 h, ending in
the OCV mode again.

To enable better comparison and quantification
of the slope of
the pressure change for a different anode geometry, we divide the
slope β by the geometric surface area of the respective anode
(Zn foil and Zn sponge as well as Zn particles; see also Figure S5), referred to as β*.

The
value for β3* = β2* – β1* (with β1* = 23.56 mbar h–1 cm–2 and β2* = 64.17 mbar h–1 cm–2, respectively) obtained during charge at the second
potential plateau is approximately 40.61 mbar h–1 cm–2 and corresponds to approximately 12.94 μmol
h–1 cm–2 of evolved gas—even
after ZnO as the designated source of oxygen in the overall cell reaction
has been converted completely.

It can be presumed that the additional
increase of pressure stems
from the formation of hydrogen by means of the well-known electrochemical
HER. This assumption is supported by comparing β3* to the pressure
slope that is obtained for the chemical reaction of H2O
from the electrolyte with the Zn foil anode (only 8.79 mbar h–1 cm–2 as shown in Figure S5a). The chemical formation of H2 is much
slower compared to the electrochemical formation of H2 during
overcharging the Zn–O2 battery at 1.0 mA cm–2 as shown in Figure 2a. The rate of the electrochemical formation of H2 increases almost linearly with the current density applied
(see Figure S5b; 200.57 mbar h–1 cm–2 at 5.0 mA cm–2). The finding
that the rate of the electrochemical formation of hydrogen is faster
than the chemical one is in contrast to the results from Einerhand
et al.,27 whereas they draw their conclusions
not from a battery during operation. Besides, a different electrolyte,
namely, 8 M KOH saturated with 1 M zincate, is used, for which the
amount of zincate in the electrolyte should reduce the activity of
H2O. This relation should diminish the apparent rate of
the electrochemical hydrogen evolution.25

It is worth mentioning at this point that H2 evolved
in a closed battery system could be used to electrochemically recombine
with O2 at the cathode to form H2O again: Müller
et al. proposed that this intriguing recombination reaction can be
used in a large-scale Zn–O2 battery stack to compensate
for large losses of H2O from the electrolyte because of
the HER and Zn corrosion.52 Deiss et al.
included the necessity for overcharging with the benefit of recombination
to H2O into their model-based analysis of Zn–O2 battery cycling.53 However, we
do not observe that H2O can be regained in our lab-scale
battery setup, indicated by the constant increase in gas pressure
during cycling as shown in Figure 2a with the closed battery setup.

The results
of the DEMS analysis, shown in Figure 2b, give additional information on the type
of gas inside the battery during OCV (open circuit conditions without
current flow), discharge, and charge: during OCV, a small amount of
H2 (ascribed to the ion current at m/z = 2) is detected as can be expected from zinc corrosion.
The amount of O2 (ascribed to the ion current at m/z = 32) decreases as expected with an
almost constant slope during discharge in each cycle, whereas only
a small and constant amount of H2 is detected. However,
a drastic increase of evolved H2 can be observed in each
cycle during charge, while O2 is evolved and can be detected
as expected as well. Even by using a Zn sponge as the state-of-the-art
anode, which is doped with In and Bi as inhibitors to suppress HER,
we observe the same trend for the evolution of H2 (compare Figures S7b and S8).

Charging a battery
further that is already at 100% state-of-charge
after assembly does not show a significant increase of the ion current
for O2 (compare Figure 2c for using a pristine Zn anode). Instead, the ion
current ascribed to H2 is increasing while the battery
is charged. This observation implies that the formation of the H2 species is caused by an electrochemical reaction, which we
will further elucidate in the following.

To suppress the formation
of H2, we assembled a Zn–O2 battery with
800 ppm of polyethylene glycol in the electrolyte
(see Figure S10) and recorded the respective
pressure change in the O2 reservoir. Adding a surfactant
to the electrolyte decreases the amount of additionally evolved gas
in general, which also holds good for our results. Using Zn particles
that are surface-treated with indium (In) and bismuth (Bi) or using
poly acrylic acid (PAA) as the electrolyte additive does not have
a significant impact on the rate of gas evolution during the OCV mode
(see Figure S10c). Because further optimization
of the electrolyte is out of the scope of this study, we refer the
reader to further study about electrolyte additives.55−59

Impact of Anode Roughness on Charge
To further shed
light on the evolution of H2 during charge, we apply discharge
and charge cycling for a Zn–O2 battery with a reference
electrode. Besides, we use ex situ SEM analysis of the Zn anode to
link morphological changes on the electrode surface to the electrochemical
results obtained. The results are depicted in Figure 3a,b.

Figure 3 (a) Cycling a Zn–O2 battery
at 1.0 mA cm–2 with a Zn foil as the anode and a
Ni(OH)2/NiOOH reference electrode soaked with 4 mol dm–3 KOH. (b) SEM analysis of the anode in the pristine
state and after
various steps of cycling (corresponding electrochemical data shown
in Figure S9).

The performed EIS measurements (Figure S11) reveal that the increase of the potential during
charge at the
second potential plateau is not due to an increase of the internal
resistance of the battery. This result and the aforementioned cycling
profiles imply that there is a relation between the charge mechanism
at the second potential plateau and an increase in overpotential because
of the presence of the electrochemically induced HER. For better comparison,
the overpotential for the hydrogen evolution on Zn metal is given
in a previous study by Lee.54

Figure 3a reveals
the contribution of each electrode to the full cell potential: the
cathode potential remains almost constant during each step of discharge
and charge and does not fluctuate. Besides, the overvoltage at the
cathode is much higher than for the anode during operation, which
is well known for Zn–O2 batteries.53 The potential of the anode is not constant during charge
at the second potential plateau and fluctuates significantly, which
can be correlated to evolving gas bubbles. This random gas formation
can decrease the electrochemical active surface area and thus increase
the potential at the anode.

The SEM analysis, shown in Figure 3b (corresponding
electrochemical data in Figure S9; corresponding
elemental analysis of
the agglomerates formed is shown in Figure S12), reveals that the surface of the anode has changed during charge
at the second potential plateau: a pristine anode possesses a smooth
surface with a defined surface area, which leads to cycling with stable
cell potentials. After one full discharge/charge cycle, the electrode
surface is covered with unevenly distributed agglomerates of Zn and
ZnO that have formed randomly during stripping and plating. The structural
properties of the agglomerates are investigated by X-ray diffraction
analysis (XRD) (results of the analysis for similar cycling data are
shown in Figure S13). We observe that indeed
ZnO is formed on the anode surface after discharge and that ZnO is
formed to a lesser extent for overcharging a battery with a Zn foil
anode.

Figure 4 shows that
the value of the second potential plateau can be shifted if the surface
of the pristine Zn anode is roughened (here intentionally etched with
HCl before use; increase in surface roughness between the pristine
and the etched state shown in Figure 4b,c). Cycling a battery with the roughened anode surface
leads to a decrease in the overpotential during charge at the second
potential plateau by 60 mV. The potential at the anode scales with
the active surface area: an increased surface area will provide more
reaction sites, whereas only the same number of electrons participates
in the electrochemical reaction (constant current operation). Thus,
more of the reactants in the liquid electrolyte can reach the higher
amount of reaction sites, lowering presumably the concentration overpotential
and thus yielding a reduced overpotential in total.

DoD is 0% after assembly: (a) pristine state. (b) Etched Zn foil as
the anode (the etching solution was 0.5 M HCl). (c,d) SEM images of
the surface of both the pristine and the as-prepared/etched Zn foil
anode.

H2 is formed electrochemically from
the solvent H2O during the overcharge of a Zn–O2 battery,
which is in line with previous studies, and is known for decades already.54,60,61 It is to be noted that the chemical
reaction of Zn metal with H2O is often assumed to be the
predominant process.27,62−64

In Figure S14, we summarize the reactions
known to take place at the anode of the Zn–O2 battery.
It can be presumed that the impact of the electrochemically induced
HER54,60,61 has severe
consequences for the cycling of the battery because the reaction consumes
solvent water in the aqueous electrolyte. In this view, it might be
challenging to estimate the practical cycling stability and lifetime
of Zn–O2 batteries if Zn foil is used as the anode
because it enables the consumption of the solvent H2O in
the electrolyte and gas evolution at the same time (compare also Figure S2; charging a cell with a large excess
of the liquid electrolyte progresses without a change in the charging
plateau). Using defined amounts of the electrolyte instead of an excess
electrolyte can help notice whether unwanted overcharge takes place
or not—complete consumption of the electrolyte would then yield
early battery failure and reasonable, practical cycle numbers.

By implication, testing a novel catalyst material at the cathode
by means of a full cell test with the Zn foil anode might not reveal
the full impact of the cathode because slight changes on the anode
surface (different distributor; variation in surface treating before
use) will affect the overall cell potential.

Conclusions
We aim to extend the already existing knowledge
about the evolution
of hydrogen during the operation of zinc–oxygen batteries.
By applying a comprehensive set of electrochemical measurements, morphology
analysis, and gas analytic, we show a link between the evolution of
hydrogen and the processes at the anode. We observe by means of DEMS
that the ion current signal ascribed to hydrogen is higher during
charge than during discharge and conclude that hydrogen mainly stems
from a deleterious electrochemical reaction at the anode. This process
and its polarization behavior both depend on the current as well as
on the surface area of the anode. By implication, some of the electrons
used to recharge aqueous zinc–oxygen batteries can be easily
dissipated into deleterious side reactions that, in the end, can consume
water until the electrolyte is depleted.

The results gained
help to put the use of zinc foil as the anode
for performance testing of zinc–oxygen batteries into perspective:
once all zinc oxide is converted back to zinc, an increase in overpotential
due to the presence of the electrochemically induced evolution of
hydrogen sets in. The starting point for this increase is not detectable
in the electrochemical data if a large excess of the electrolyte is
used. The findings can be used to carefully select the testing protocols
and cell setups for zinc–oxygen batteries to reveal their true
performance and the impact of novel materials introduced.

Methods
Electrode Preparation
The Zn foil anodes (2 mm thickness,
>99.99%, ChemPur, Germany) were polished before use with SiC paper
(5 μm, Buehler); the preparation of Zn sponge anodes (used for
better comparison to state-of-the-art cycling performance; based on
the work by Parker and colleagues43,44) and gas diffusion
electrodes (GDEs) with the Sr2CoO3Cl catalyst
was carried out as described previously.45,46 HCl (0.5 M) (reactant grade) was used to chemically etch off the
surface of pristine Zn anodes.

The Zn foil anode is not the
state-of-the-art electrode regarding cycling stability and performance
but was chosen for the purpose of the herein conducted fundamental
study to shed light on the otherwise less-distinct HER during the
operation. The reasons for using Zn foil as the anode in Zn–O2 battery research are as follows: easy handling and cutting
to almost any size; no need for additional host material or current
collector while providing mechanical stability. On the downside, no
full discharge to 100% of the discharge capacity is possible, as well
as fast passivation47,48 with ZnO can occur (compare diminished
passivation with 3D-structured and Zn particle anodes).43,44,49

Assembly of Zn–O2 Cells
Zn–O2 cells were prepared as CR2032 coin-type cells (TOB New Energy
Limited) or as in-house-modified Swagelok-type cells (i.e., known
as “Giessen cell”)50 using
the following assembly protocol: The freshly polished Zn foil (12
mm diameter) anode was placed on top of a tin (Sn) disk current collector
(125 μm thickness, 99.99+%, ChemPur, 16 mm diameter for CR2032,
13 mm diameter for Swagelok-type) and covered with 150 μL of
4 mol dm–3 KOH aqueous electrolyte. Four laminated
(16 mm diameter for CR2032, 13 mm diameter for Swagelok-type) nonwoven
separators (Celgard 5550) were soaked in 4 mol dm–3 KOH solution and used as the separator between the Zn anode, and
the GDE. 800 ppm polyethylene glycol (PEG 600, Sigma-Aldrich) was
used as the additive in 4 mol dm–3 KOH solution
to suppress HER where mentioned. Additional 25 μL of KOH solution
(4 mol dm–3) were used to wet the exposed separator
membrane surface again before placing the GDE (10 mm diameter) and
closing the cell. A titanium mesh (10 mm diameter, 0.076 mm wire thickness,
Alfa Aesar) was used as the current collector at the cathode side.
As particular modification in the coin-type cell, a stainless steel
spacer (15.5 mm diameter, 0.2 mm thick, MTI Corporation) was placed
underneath the Sn current collector. The void space between the spacer,
Sn current collector, and Zn anode was kept dry, and the infiltration
of the electrolyte was prevented by using an insulating tape made
of polytetrafluoroethylene. A stainless steel spring (15.4 mm diameter,
1.1 mm thick, MTI Corporation) was on top of the titanium mesh current
collector. Finally, the coin cell was automatically closed with a
crimping machine at a pressure equivalent to 1 ton per coin cell area
(MTI Corporation). A Ni(OH)2/NiOOH reference electrode
(Panasonic) was used as the quasi-reference electrode in the three-electrode
measurements with a Swagelok-type cell.

To evaluate and report
data on Zn−O2 batteries, guidelines introduced in
a very recent perspective article by Parker et al.,51 were followed.

Pressure Measurement
Time-dependent pressure change
inside the gas volume of the Swagelok-type cells was recorded using
an PAA-33X absolute pressure sensor, a K104B USB computer adapter
(both Omega Engineering), and the software ControlCenterSeries30 (Keller
AG) during cycling (compare Figure S1a for
the measurement setup).

Electrochemical Characterization
Electrochemical characterization
was performed using a SP-300 potentiostat/galvanostat (Biologic) and
a BCS-805 battery cycler (Biologic) at room temperature. The Zn–O2 coin cells were cycled inside a sealed gas container [total
volume of approximately 0.5 L, filled with humidified O2 (purity 5.0, Praxair)]. The Swagelok-type cells—with a gas
reservoir of approximately 8 mL—were likewise filled with pure
humidified O2 at 1 bar. Zn–O2 cells were
galvanostatically cycled at ±1.0, 5.0, and 10.0 mA cm–2 with the cut-off potential during discharge set to 0.90 V.

Where needed, capacity values referred to in this work are based
on the mass of active material Zn used. Overcharging occurs if the
mA h/gZn gained during discharge is gained back in the
subsequent charge step, added a surplus amount of mA h/gZn in capacity.

Differential Electrochemical Mass Spectrometry
Lysgaard
et al. used additives on the Zn anode surface and determined the amount
of H2 that was formed by using DEMS by accumulating gas
within 1 h of charge for each data point.21 We apply a continuous flow DEMS setup, that is, an open system to
investigate the gas composition in electrically rechargeable Zn–O2 cells with resolution in time in the range of several minutes
(see also Figure S1b for details on the
measurement setup). After preparation of the electrodes (Zn foil or
Zn sponge, GDE and Sn disk current collector; all 10 mm diameter)
and separators (three anion-exchange membranes 16 mm diameter, A-201
(Tokuyama) or nonwoven separators (Celgard 5550) soaked with the electrolyte
as previously reported46), the cell elements
were transferred to a glovebox with a nitrogen atmosphere and assembled
as the Zn–O2 cell as described above. Then, the
Zn–O2 cell was connected to the DEMS setup, which
consists of a BaSyTec cycling station for electrochemical analysis,
a mass flow controller (control unit PR4000, MKS), and the mass spectroscopy
unit (Prisma QMA 200, Pfeiffer Vacuum GmbH). The cell was initially
fed with 3.5 mL min–1 of synthetic air (80% N2, 20% O2) to ensure optimal reactant distribution;
the flow was reduced to 0.5 mL min–1 after 15 min,
allowing an optimal determination of the gas composition. To prevent
drying out of the cell, the gas flow was directed through a humidifier
(tank with deionized H2O) and then directed into the cell.
For better data visualization, the current signal for m/z = 32 (assigned to oxygen) was drift-corrected
because a linear increase of the total ion current I0—originating from the measurement setup and not
from the electrochemical cell—was observed (compare raw data
in the Supporting Information).

Scanning Electron Microscopy
Microstructure images
of Zn foil anodes (before and after cycling) were obtained on a Merlin
high-resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM; Carl Zeiss AG,
Germany).

Energy-Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy
Extended surface
analysis by means of energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping
was performed with a 50 mm2 Silicon Drift Detector X-Max
(Oxford Instruments) during SEM analysis at the very same samples.

X-Ray Diffraction
An Empyrean X-ray powder diffractometer
(Cu Kα, 40 kV, 40 mA; PANalytical) was used to provide structural
data on the surface of Zn foil anodes.
