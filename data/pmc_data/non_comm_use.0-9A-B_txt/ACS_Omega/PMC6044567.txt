Complete removal of metal catalyst
particles from carbon nanofibers
(CNFs) and other carbon nanostructures is extremely difficult, and
the envisioned applications may be compromised by the left-over impurities.
To circumvent these problems, one should use, wherever possible, such
catalyst materials that are meant to remain in the structure and have
some application-specific role, making any removal steps unnecessary.
Thus, as a proof-of-concept, we present here a nanocarbon-based material
platform for electrochemical hydrogen peroxide measurement utilizing
a Pt catalyst layer to grow CNFs with intact Pt particles at the tips
of the CNFs. Backed by careful scanning transmission electron microscopy
analysis, we show that this material can be readily realized with
the Pt catalyst layer thickness impacting the resulting structure
and also present a growth model to explain the evolution of the different
types of structures. In addition, we show by electrochemical analysis
that the material exhibits characteristic features of Pt in cyclic
voltammetry and it can detect very small amounts of hydrogen peroxide
with very fast response times. Thus, the present sensor platform provides
an interesting electrode material with potential for biomolecule detection
and in fuel cells and batteries. In the wider range, we propose a
new approach where the selection of catalytic particles used for carbon
nanostructure growth is made so that (i) they do not need to be removed
and (ii) they will have essential role in the final application.

Introduction
Despite its simple
structure, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has a widespread
usage ranging all the way from industrial
to alimentary and clinical applications. It can be either electrochemically
oxidized to O2 (E0 = 0.695
V) or reduced to water (E0 = 1.763 V)
in diffusion-controlled two-electron processes.1 Hydrogen peroxide and its redox reactions are closely linked
to fuel cell technology as it is formed as a reaction intermediate
in the oxygen reduction reaction.1−3 Furthermore, H2O2 is formed as a byproduct in various enzymatic reactions
such as those catalyzed by glucose oxidase,4 glutamate oxidase,5 and cholesterol oxidase.6 Enzymatic production makes H2O2 feasible for biosensor applications as it can be indirectly7 detected at lower potentials compared to the
enzyme substrate molecules. However, H2O2 is
typically detected indirectly in sensor applications by its chemical
interaction with metallic electrode surfaces, which then produce the
current, as is the case, for example, with Pt.

Pt-based electrodes
have been frequently used to detect hydrogen
peroxide.8−10 Likewise, carbon-based nanostructures in the form
of nanotubes and nanofibers have been extensively used in the detection
of different biomolecules via and without enzymatic detection.11−17 The structure of oriented carbon nanofibers (CNFs) is especially
ideal for enzyme linking without any additional polymer layers. For
example, glutamate detection via enzymatic reaction that produces
hydrogen peroxide with various metal-particle-containing carbon nanotubes
(CNTs) and CNFs has been demonstrated.18,19 These metal
particles typically remain in
the catalyst layers used to grow the carbon nanostructures that stay
on the tubes or fibers despite the cleaning procedures. Consequently,
unwanted electrochemical features are often introduced and the interpretation
and control of the reactions taking place in the systems become complicated.
On the basis of the available information, it appears that carbon
alone is not as active toward the hydrogen peroxide as the carbon
hybrids containing metallic nanoparticles. Hence, we introduce the
concept of utilizing application-specific catalyst layers in this
article to realize carbon nanostructures where metallic nanoparticles
on the tips of the nanostructures are present not because they are
optimum for the growth process but because they have a specific electrochemical
role in the final structure. This approach requires no removal procedures
as the remaining metallic catalyst is actually needed for the intended
application. Thus, as a proof-of-concept, we combine here the structural
features of CNFs with the known electrocatalytic properties of Pt
to demonstrate the growth of Pt-containing CNFs and show that they
can be used for hydrogen peroxide detection with high sensitivity.
The objective is to fabricate a structure with a high amount of small
catalytic particles that do not experience coarsening during continuous
use and that are directly electrically connected to the electrode
surface. Detailed high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HRTEM) analysis combined with the electrochemical characterization
is utilized to support our arguments and rationalize the growth of
these novel materials.

Results
Structure
Figure 1 shows the resulting
structures from the growth process
for two different Pt layer thicknesses. The 2 nm thick Pt catalyst
layer did not produce proper fibers; instead, formation of cone-like
structures with a large number of small Ti particles randomly scattered
thorough the structure is seen. The height of these cone-like features
is on the order of a few tens of nanometers. One can also clearly
observe that the Ti layer has reacted with Si to form Ti-silicide
(most likely TiSi2); consequently, there are many characteristic
trenches for the silicide formation reaction at the Si interface.
In addition, there is no continuous Ti layer on top of Si, but the
Ti is either distributed inside the cone-like structures or incorporated
in the Ti-silicide, as shown by energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS)
elemental map (Supporting Information).
Pt is also similarly distributed within the whole reaction zone.

transmission electron microscopy (STEM) micrographs of
CNFs grown on (a) 2 nm thick Pt and (b) 10 nm thick catalyst layer,
with higher-magnification images in (c) and (d).

In contrast, the 10 nm thick Pt catalyst layer has produced
CNFs.
The length of the fibers is typically a few hundreds of nanometers,
but some structures are up to the micrometer scale. Again, one can
see a fairly large number of finely dispersed Ti particles along the
body of the fiber. However, Pt particles are also seen at the tip
of the fibers (Figure 2), which was not the case with the cone-like structures. In addition,
the original Ti layer is still mostly preserved at the Si/Ti interface
in contrast to the samples with the 2 nm thick Pt layer (see EDS elemental
maps in Supporting information) despite
the formation of Ti-silicide(s) at some locations. A notable feature
is that the CNFs appear to adhere to the surface only from the locations
where the Ti layer is still intact and not where Ti-silicide formation
has taken place. Thus, this underlines the role of Ti as the adhesion
layer in our structure. Despite the fact that the 10 nm thick Pt catalyst
layer does produce CNFs, the growth kinetics is rather slow when compared
to that of the
same process with Ni catalyst.20,21

layer with higher magnifications: (a) overview of the structure, (b)

larger Pt particles, and (c, d) high-magnification micrographs showing
the interfacial structure between the Pt particle and the graphene
planes of the CNFs.

Higher-magnification
imaging of the CNFs grown with the 10 nm Pt
catalyst layer reveals several features: (i) in most cases, the Pt
can be found exclusively at the tip of the CNF as a particle. At some
locations, it appears that Pt particles are also distributed along
the fiber body, but this represents a minority case. In addition,
in many cases, this may be a result of fibers of different lengths
crossing each other. (ii) Pt particles at the tip of the fibers do
not seem to have any specific shape or size, but they are more or
less of random orientation and size. This is likely to be a result
of the mostly repulsive interaction between Pt and C as discussed
later on. However, the structure seems to be single crystal. (iii)
The number of finely dispersed Ti particles strongly decreases as
one moves from the root of the fiber toward the tip. (iv) The ordering
of graphene planes in the fibers and around the Pt particles is not
so pronounced as with other catalyst materials such as Ni,20,21 which again most likely has its origin on the repulsive interaction
between Pt and C.

Electrochemistry
Only the CNF/Pt
samples with the 10
nm Pt catalyst layer produced clear Pt-type characteristics during
cyclic voltammetry. This indicates that the amount of exposed Pt was
not high enough with the samples grown from the 2 nm Pt catalyst layer.
Therefore, only the results from the samples with the 10 nm Pt layer
are presented here in Figure 3a, showing the cyclic voltammogram of the CNF/Pt hybrid material
in 0.15 M H2SO4. A similar voltammogram for
the polycrystalline thin-film Pt sample is shown in Figure 3b, and Pt-like features are
evident from a comparison of Figure 3a,b. At the anodic end of Figure 3a, one can see the shoulder related to the
formation of Pt-oxide although it is not possible to observe clearly
all the three peaks corresponding to the gradual formation process
of Pt-oxide on polycrystalline Pt in ultrahigh-purity H2SO4.22 Also, the reduction
peak of Pt-oxide is clear with the CNF/Pt electrode. Likewise, at
the cathodic end, the hydrogen adsorption and desorption peaks are
evident although they are not as clearly exhibited as with the thin-film
Pt sample. The slight attenuation of the Pt features in the case of
CNF/Pt samples might be caused by impurities present in the system.
However, as the current at the anodic end does not rise significantly
at the Pt-oxide formation region, the amount of oxidizable impurities
is not expected to be very high. In fact, the most likely origin of
any oxidizable and other impurities in the case of CNF/Pt electrodes
would be the samples themselves. Therefore, we believe that we can
to a large extent ignore these minor additional features in the electrochemistry
of these samples. Thus, we can state that the CNF/Pt electrode clearly
shows the features of polycrystalline Pt, indicating that the Pt particles
present in the structure are not predominantly of certain orientation
(e.g., only (111) or (200)) but more or less randomly oriented. The
notable differences between the CNF/Pt and thin-film polycrystalline
Pt samples include (i) the cathodic shift and less-well-defined shape
of the Pt-oxide reduction peak and (ii) the narrower double-layer
region and higher background current density in the case of the CNF/Pt
electrode. These differences are likely to be a result of CNF/Pt having
a higher active area than that of the geometrically same-sized thin-film
Pt electrode and because Pt is in the form of nanoparticles instead
of a film, as discussed later on. It is to be noted that there is
no observable electrochemical effect from the Ti nanoparticles embedded
within the CNF.

CNF/Pt(10 nm) and (b) thin film of Pt (4 nm) on the Si/Ti sample.
The cycling speed is 50 mV/s.

Figure 4a
shows
the results from the chronoamperometry measurements with different
amounts of H2O2 in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) with the CNF/Pt (10 nm) samples. The potential is stepped
to −0.1 V versus Ag/AgCl reference, that is, to the double-layer
region, and the solutions were not purged with argon. The reasons
for these choices are that (i) we are detecting the reduction current
originating from the reduction of the unstable Pt-oxide formed as
a consequence of the chemical decomposition of H2O2 on the originally metallic Pt and that (ii) we need to assess
if oxygen, which is inevitably present under the in vivo conditions,
would disturb our measurements. Details of the mechanism related to
(i) are described elsewhere.7,9 As can be seen in Figure 4, the presence of
hydrogen peroxide increases the cathodic current that starts to significantly
deviate from the charging current already after 20 ms although the
differences in the concentrations become more evident after about
60 ms. Thus, the response time is very fast as required by many applications
such as enzymatic glutamate detection for example.23Figure 4b shows that the CNF/Pt (10 nm) electrode also has a fairly long
linear range for H2O2, which together with the
fast response time and high sensitivity makes this material a promising
platform for hydrogen peroxide detection.

Discussion
To
gain more insight into the growth mechanism responsible for
the observed structures, cross-sectional STEM investigations of the
as-fabricated and preannealed Si/Ti/ta-C/Pt (2 or 10 nm) samples were
carried out.

Figure 5 shows the
two types of samples (2 or 10 nm Pt) after the deposition process.
The 2 nm Pt catalyst layer shows an uneven rough structure and some
discontinuities in the film (Figure 5a,b) whereas the 10 nm Pt layer appears to be uniform
with a relatively flat surface (Figure 5c,d). The Ti adhesion layer and ta-C layer are of similar
thicknesses and morphologies in both types of samples. The ta-C layer
is slightly thinner in both cases than expected (e.g. 5 vs 7 nm).
The interface between the Ti and ta-C layers is not particularly sharp
in either sample type, indicating some degree of mixing, but there
is no evidence of excessive interfacial reaction or interdiffusion
after the deposition. There is an additional layer at the Si/Ti interface
in both samples, which has been shown to be an oxygen-rich SiOx type of layer.24,25 The above
arguments are further confirmed by the dark-field images (Figure 5b,d).

Figure 5 Bright-field and dark-field
STEM micrographs from the (a, b) Si/Ti/ta-C/Pt(2
nm) and (c, d) Si/Ti/ta-C/Pt(10 nm) samples after fabrication.

To obtain further information
about the structures of catalyst
layers after fabrication, we carried out X-ray reflection (XRR) and
grazing incidence angle X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements for
the two types of samples. While comparing the GIXRD spectra (Figure 6) for the 2 and 10
nm Pt films, it is evident that there are significant differences
in the film structure already after fabrication. Whereas in the 10
nm Pt film all five Pt peaks are clearly present, in the 2 nm Pt film
hardly any Pt features can be seen and peaks most likely originating
from the underlying Ti and Si layers can also be observed (the peak
around 50°, which has not been indexed in Figure 6 as the origin of it is not unambiguously
known). This indicates that the 10 nm Pt film is clearly continuous
and polycrystalline with no preferred orientation, whereas the 2 nm
Pt film is likely to be relatively non-uniform with varying thickness,
which is consistent with the STEM micrographs seen in Figure 5a–d. On the basis of
the analysis of full width at half-maximum of the Pt peaks, the grain
size could be estimated to be in the range of 5 nm in the 10 nm Pt
catalyst film. The XRR measurements (Figure S3a,b) from the two types of samples further suggest that whereas the
10 nm Pt film appears to be fully continuous and uniform the 2 nm
Pt film appears to be relatively discontinuous, and some mixing with
the underlying ta-C film seems to have occurred already during deposition.
Thus, on the basis of GIXRD and XRR measurements, the following conclusions
can be drawn: (i) the 10 nm Pt catalyst film after deposition is continuous,
uniform, and shows no preferential orientation with a grain size on
the order of 5 nm, whereas (ii) the 2 nm Pt film appears to be highly
non-uniform and discontinuous. These observations are fully consistent
with the STEM results discussed above.

Si/Ti/ta-C/Pt (10 nm) and Si/Ti/ta-C/Pt
(2 nm) samples. The inset shows the magnified view from the region
between 30 and 60° (2θ). Note that the peak around 50°
could be indexed both to Ti and Si and has therefore been left unindexed.
Peaks’ locations are based on the data from refs (26−28).

Figure 7 shows the
same type of samples as in Figure 5 but now after preannealing, just before the growth
stage. The 2 nm Pt layer appears highly irregular and shows a lot
of discontinuities as a result of preannealing. In addition, there
are some signs of interdiffusion at the ta-C/Pt interface. In contrast,
the 10 nm Pt sample shows again a uniform Pt layer on top of ta-C
and there is hardly any change in this case when compared to the same
type of sample after deposition. Thus, it can be concluded that the
10 nm Pt layer is still uniform and protects the underlying structure
after the preannealing stage (just before the growth phase starts),
whereas this is clearly not the case with the 2 nm thick Pt layer.
This is suggested to lead to the observed differences in the resulting
structures as discussed next.

Figure 8 shows the
bright-field (a,c) and dark-field (b,d) images of the resulting nanostructures
as well as (e) a schematic presentation of the resulting structures,
on which we base the following discussion about the details of the
growth phenomena. On the basis of the information from the literature
and from the results of this work, it is evident that Pt is not a
particularly good catalyst for CNF or CNT growth.29,30 This is caused most likely by the repulsive interaction between
Pt and C, which leads among other things to a very low solubility
of graphite to fcc-Pt. In addition, there are no known Pt-carbides
(stable or metastable), further highlighting the lack of any attractive
interaction between Pt and C. The repulsive interaction between Pt
and C by no means excludes the mixing of the elements as the latter
process is fundamentally driven by the increase in the configurational
entropy of the system. Contributions from the entropy can be expected
to overrun any enthalpy contributions (interaction term) quite easily
at these relatively high temperatures. However, the lack of favorable
interaction between Pt and C leads to a long incubation time at the
start of the growth phase. This is the case of the 2 nm thick Pt layer,
leading to the disintegration of the whole initial structure owing
to the following reasons: (i) on the basis of the micrographs in Figures 5 and 7, as well as GIXRD and XRR results (Figures 6 and S3), the
2 nm Pt layer is highly discontinuous already after the deposition
stage and becomes more and more irregular during the preannealing
stage before the growth phase starts. (ii) Consequently, the ta-C
layer is directly exposed (at least partly) to the acetylene (carbon
plasma) in the chamber. When the acetylene decomposes on the surface,
it produces mostly carbon and hydrogen.31 The hydrogen from the decomposition will etch and graphitize the
ta-C thin films (see the Raman results in Figure S4), which then leads to the partial (or total) disappearance
of the ta-C film. (iii) As a result, there is no fully protective
ta-C film on top of the Ti layer and it will start to react with the
incoming carbon, leading to the production of the mixed carbon and
titanium cones. Pt is also distributed randomly along the cones as
there is practically no “growth” phase in this case
(Figure 8a,b).

as well as (b, d) dark-field STEM micrographs
showing the resulting structures from the growth process with (a,
b) Si/Ti/ta-C/Pt (2 nm) and (c, d) Si/Ti/ta-C/Pt (10 nm) samples.
(e) Schematic presentation of the resulting structures.

Some of the Ti also reacts with the underlying
Si substrate to
produce Ti-silicide, which together with the cone formation results
into the disappearance of the original Ti layer. In contrast, the
10 nm Pt film, owing to its uniform morphology after the preannealing
stage, manages to protect the underlying ta-C (and consequently also
Ti) films until the actual CNF growth phase kicks in. Thus, this results
into the observed structure where Pt particles are at the tips of
the resulting CNF and most of the Ti layer is still present at the
Si interface (Figure 7b,d). Also, the structure of the fibers in this case is somewhat
less ordered than, for example, that with Ni catalysts, owing to the
repulsive nature of the Pt interaction with the graphene sheets. The
Pt particles observed at the CNF tips are mostly single crystals (Figure 9), but their size
is too large in general that they could be directly traced back to
the original Pt film with the grain size on the order of 5 nm. It
is possible that during the initial CNF growth stage the Pt film partly
disintegrates and recrystallizes to produce these larger grains that
can be found at the tips of the CNF. However, this issue requires
further studies. The ta-C layer is again decomposed after the exposure
to the growth environment by hydrogen formed during the decomposition
of acetylene and perhaps partly used for the CNF growth.

Figure 9 (a) Bright-field
and (b) dark-field STEM micrographs showing that
Pt particles are in fact single crystals. The small particles seen
in the micrographs are mostly Ti.

Hence, we can conclude that owing to the repulsive interaction
between Pt and C and the resulting relatively poor catalytic properties
of Pt for CNF growth, the incubation time at the start of the growth
becomes long. This then leads to complete disintegration of the Si/Ti/ta-C/Pt
(2 nm) structure before any actual growth can occur, subsequently
leading to the observed cone-type structures where Ti and Pt particles
are randomly scattered along the disordered structure. In contrast,
the 10 nm Pt catalyst layer is able to protect the underlying structure
from disintegration until the actual growth phase starts and therefore
leads to the observed CNF structures where Pt particles sit on the
top of the fibers and are not randomly scattered in the reaction zone.

The electrochemical features seen in Figure 3 and especially the cathodic shift in the
Pt-oxide reduction potential and the shape of the peak can be understood
on the basis of the above discussion. The reduction peak is shifted
cathodically with respect to that of the thin-film Pt electrode, owing
to the small size of the Pt particles at the tip of the CNF, which
leads to a higher adsorption strength of OH on these particles in
comparison to that on the Pt thin film, as shown in refs (32, 33). Thus, the reduction of the Pt-oxide becomes
harder than that in the case of a uniform (“infinite”)
Pt film. The electrode shown in Figure 3a has been cycled already ca. 50 cycles before recording
the voltammogram in the figure. This exemplifies the stability of
the CNF-anchored nanoparticles as the Pt-oxide reduction peak does
not become narrower and shifts back to that of bulk Pt, which would
indicate significant coarsening/agglomeration of the structure34 even with this prolonged cycling. Thus, the
desired high active catalyst area is retained. This is a clear advantage
over conventional Pt nanoparticle carbon hybrids where Pt is deposited
on top of an existing carbon structure and can be expected to be beneficial
not only in basic research of nanoparticle electrochemistry but also,
for example, in fuel cell technology. In addition, as shown in Figure 8, there is a relatively
large size distribution among the Pt particles. This is suggested
to lead to the broadening of the Pt-oxide reduction peak as the OH
adsorption strength will change as a function of the Pt particle size33 and lead to a gradual reduction (thus wide peak)
reaction where largest particles are reduced first followed by the
smaller ones. Finally, the various single Pt crystals at the CNF tips
must possess different orientations as the voltammogram clearly shows
features of polycrystalline Pt without any signs of electrochemical
response arising from only certain orientations of Pt films, such
as (111), (110), and (100).35

The
amperometric response of our structure toward H2O2 is shown in Figure 4. The current density (circular sample area, r =
1.5 mm) was averaged between 0.05 and 0.2 s from step
2 to evaluate the linear response. Between 10 and 1000 μM, the
ta-C/CNF hybrid shows a linear behavior with a limit of detection
of ∼0.2 nM (S/N = 3) and sensitivity of 0.1478 μA μM–1 cm–2 (Table 1). An earlier study with vertically aligned
CNFs showed a detection limit of 66 μM and sensitivity of 0.0906
μA μM–1 cm–2 at anodic
current (at 0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl48). Here,
we have gained significant improvement in sensitivity, over 300 000-fold,
at the cathodic end (−0.1 V) when the calculated limit of detection
is considered. Thus, incorporating Pt (and only Pt) intentionally
to CNF tips has had a significant positive effect on the electrochemical
performance of the CNF structure as desired.

Compared to that of other carbon
nanomaterials, the improvement
in sensitivity is also significant as can be seen from Table 1 and remains unmatched even
by Pt nanoparticles on CNTs.36 Also, if
one compares the present material to mesoporous Pt50 and Pt nanowires,51 CNF + Pt
electrodes outperform these structures significantly both in sensitivity
and temporal resolution. The fact that we utilize a reductive potential
of −0.1 V (vs Ag/AgCl) most likely reduces the interference
from, for example, dopamine and ascorbic acid as these typically oxidize
at higher (positive) potentials on carbon-based structures and Pt.52−54 Moreover, the response time of our electrode material for H2O2 is clearly faster than for any other structure
shown in Table 1. This
is a huge advantage in enzymatic sensing of different biomolecules
such as an important neurotransmitter glutamate. In situ detection
of glutamate is an extremely difficult task especially owing to the
strict temporal and spatial requirements (response times must be few
tens of microseconds and measurement probe size approximately 1–5
μm).23 On the basis of the values
shown in Table 1, our
structure is the only one that can meet the temporal requirement and
has the potential to provide physically meaningful information from
in situ measurements. The CNF structure also provides means to meet
the spatial requirement as the individual CNF-Pt fibers have diameters
less than 100 nm, thus making the present material platform extremely
interesting from sensing point of view. This is an important advantage
over various other Pt-incorporated carbon nanostructures obtained
with electrospinning and subsequent carbonization,55−57 as it would
be very difficult to realize devices with micrometer or nanometer
size dimensions from these ones. Finally, the crucial role of Pt particles
at the CNF tips for reaching the present sensitivity and time resolution
levels toward H2O2 can be appreciated when considering
the results from the identical amperometric measurements made by utilizing
Pt-free CNFs reported by us earlier in ref (19). In this study, we processed similar CNF structures
by the same growth parameters as here but by utilizing nanodiamonds
as a catalyst layer, thus achieving metal-free CNF structures. The
response of these structures towards H2O2 was
significantly weaker than that of the present structure,19 highlighting the necessity of having the Pt
particles at the CNF tips to achieve superior performance. Likewise,
in the same study,19 we also used Ni catalyst
(and again the same processing parameters) to grow CNF structures
with Ni particles at their tips,19 but
again the performance was of markedly lower quality than that achieved
with the CNF/Pt structures in the present study.

Conclusions
We
have introduced a novel concept of using application-specific
catalyst material for CNF growth that is meant to stay in the structure.
Thus, no metal particle removal steps are required. As a proof-of-concept,
we have realized a hybrid structure in which Pt nanoparticles are
integrated into CNFs. A growth model to explain the evolution of the
different types of structures has been presented with the aid of a
detailed TEM analysis. The electrochemical analysis shows that the
material reveals characteristic features of Pt and that it can detect
small amounts of hydrogen peroxide with very fast response times.
The latter is very important in many applications, for example, in
enzymatic detection of various biomolecules such as glutamate. Benchmarking
the present results to those obtained by CNF or Pt alone highlights
that the present hybrid material has performance significantly higher
than that of its individual components.
Thus, the present material platform provides an extremely interesting
basis for further applications in biomedical technology, fuel cells,
battery technology, and related areas.

Experimental Work
Synthesis
The CNFs were grown on n-type Si(100)/Ti(20
nm)/ta-C(7 nm)/Pt(2/10 nm). The synthesis can be briefly described
as follows: n-type Si (100) wafer substrates (Ultrasil) were mounted
by hanging in a rotating carousel (0.04 rpm) in a chamber with a base
pressure of 10–3 Pa. The expected tetrahedral amorphous
carbon (ta-C) film thickness was about 7 nm. Prior to deposition,
the wafers were etched with a gridless argon ion source and coated
with Ti using a continuous-current arc source equipped with 60°
magnetic filtering. The role of Ti is to ensure excellent adhesion
of the ta-C layer on the substrate. A 2 or 10 nm thick Pt catalyst
layer was deposited on Ti using cathodic arc deposition. The catalyst-coated
wafers were placed in a cold-wall plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition
(PECVD) reactor (Aixtron, Black Magic, Germany) with the chamber pressure
pumped down to <1 Pa, and the samples were annealed at 400 °C
for 3 min before the growth process was started. The chamber was heated
to 400 °C by a ramp speed of 250 °C/min. After the annealing
step, the NH3 buffer was used to fill the chamber (100
sccm) while the chamber pressure was maintained at 0.1 mbar. The temperature
was increased to 750 °C with a ramp speed of 300 °C/min.
After the temperature had reached 675 °C, 150 W DC plasma was
ignited while injecting the carbon precursor, C2H2, to the chamber (30 sccm) and increasing the NH3 flow
to 125 sccm. The growth phase lasted 10 min and produced vertically
aligned fibers that were ∼0.2–1 μm tall, as shown
in Figure 1a,b, depending
on the Pt layer thickness. After the growth process, the pressure
was maintained below 0.2 mbar until the temperature decreased to 300
°C.

STEM Analysis
Cross-sectional STEM samples were prepared
by focused ion beam (FIB) using first 30 kV for thinning and subsequently
5 kV for final polishing. Polymer ink was used as the filler material
with 70–80 nm of sputtered Pt and FIB-deposited Pt-C to protect
the vertical CNF during thinning. HRTEM of the samples was performed
using a double-aberration-corrected microscope, JEOL 2100 (JEOL, Japan),
equipped with a X-ray EDS operating at 200 kV. A Gatan 4k × 4k
UltraScan 4000 CCD camera was employed for digital recording of the
HRTEM images.

GIXRD and XRR Measurements
GIXRD
and XRR measurements
were performed using Rigaku SmartLab diffractometer equipped with
a 9 kW rotating Cu anode (1.54 nm wavelength) and HyPix-3000 2D single
photon counting detector operated in a 1D mode. All measurements were
conducted in parallel beam mode on 10 × 10 mm2 samples
with an incidence Kα1 monochromator, a 5 mm horizontal
slit, and 5° angular aperture Soller slits at both ends. Incidence
vertical slit varied according to investigated GIXRD omega angles
determined from XRR profiles. Thus, the grazing incidence angles varied
from 0.25 to 0.40° with vertical slits of 0.043–0.069
mm for the 2 nm Pt sample and from 0.6 to 2.0° with vertical
slits of 0.104–0.348 for the thicker 10 nm Pt sample. GIXRD
scans were performed in steps of 0.2° and 1°/min in the
range of 25–93°.

Electrochemical Measurements
Cyclic
voltammetry and
amperometry were performed with a Gamry Reference 600 potentiostat
and Gamry Framework software (Gamry Instruments). The reference electrode
was a Ag/AgCl/KCl saturated electrode (+0.199 vs SHE, Radiometer Analytical)
and the counter electrode was a Pt wire in all electrochemical experiments.
The samples were dipped in deionized water before the experiments.
The electrochemical characteristics were studied in Ar-purged and
-blanketed 0.15 M H2SO4. For H2O2 experiments, a 100 mM stock solution was freshly prepared
from 30% H2O2 (Merck KGaA, Germany) by diluting
in deionized water. The electrochemical cell was filled with PBS (pH
7.4) containing NaCl (137 mM), KCl (2.7 mM), Na2HPO4 (10 mM), and KH2PO4 (1.8 mM); and the
stock solution was added directly to measure different concentrations
of H2O2. The sample was cycled in blank PBS
between −0.4 and 0.2 V versus Ag/AgCl at 50 mV/s for 10 cycles
before the amperometric measurement. The potential was then stepped
to −0.1 V versus Ag/AgCl for 180 s. Current densities were
calculated using the geometric area of the sample. It should be noted
that the actual reactive area might be higher for the Pt-containing
CNF.
