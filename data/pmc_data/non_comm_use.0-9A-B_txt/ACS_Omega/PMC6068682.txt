Nitrosocarbonyl
mesitylene intermediate undergoes an ene reaction
with cinnamyl alcohol affording the corresponding 5-hydroxy-isoxazolidine
in fair yields. The synthesized 5-acetoxy-isoxazolidine serves as
synthon for the preparation of 6-chloropurine N,O-nucleoside analogues,
according to the Vorbrüggen reaction. The compounds were evaluated
for their metabolic and apoptotic activity, and their structure–activity
relationship is discussed.

Introduction
The preparation of
modified nucleosides has been reported in last
decades as a result of many synthetic strategies with the aim to give
a response to the pressing need of reliable treatments against viral
infections. In view of expanding the molecular diversity and enforcing
the stability of these derivatives, either carbo- or heterocyclic
rings has replaced the ribose unit.

The N,O-containing nucleoside,
bearing the isoxazolidine and isoxazoline
rings, demonstrated particularly promising biological activities.1 Isoxazolidinyl-nucleosides are typically obtained
from a classical 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition, where the dipolarophiles
are usually alkenes, whereas dipoles are represented by suitable nitrones.2 A number of these N,O-nucleosides have been evaluated
for cytotoxic activity against selected cellular lines. Some of the
tested compounds have proven to be potential antiproliferative drugs
at a relatively low concentration.3 Some
of these nucleoside analogues were also tested for their apoptotic
pathway activation and were found to activate the caspase cleavage,
inducing DNA fragmentation.4

The
ene reactions of aromatic nitrosocarbonyl intermediates 1 with allylic alkoxy olefins offered an alternative pathway
for the synthesis of N,O-nucleoside analogues.5 This methodology relies upon the mild oxidation of aromatic nitrile
oxides with tertiary amine N-oxides to generate the nitrosocarbonyl
intermediates 1.6 When these
intermediates are in-situ-generated in the presence of the highly
reactive 3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol representative of the category of the
trisubstituted allylic alcohols, they undergo ene reaction by extracting
exclusively the allylic hydrogens on the more congested side of the
alkene (the “cis effect”) (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Ene Reaction of Nitrosocarbonyl Intermediates
1 with the 3-Methyl-2-buten-1-ol
and Synthetic Pathway toward Isoxazolidine N,O-Nucleoside Analogues
The reactions proceed straightforward
to the ene adducts in accordance
with the prevailing highest occupied molecular orbital(alcohol)–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital(nitrosocarbonyl) interaction, somewhat enforced by the polarization of the C=C
double bond induced by the slightly electron-withdrawing group CH2OH.7 When sterically demanding
nitrosocarbonyl mesitylene 1M (M = mesityl),
the Markovnikov (M) directing effect is relieved and the anti-Markovnikov
(AM) pathway becomes competitive and the preferred one. The selectivity
drift is further increased when the bulkier anthracene nitrosocarbonyl
intermediate 1A (A = anthryl) is used.5 The AM route preludes the enol formation and
the subsequent cyclization to the isoxazolidines Isoxd, which are the synthons for the preparation of libraries of N,O-nucleosides N,O–N containing uracil and purine heterobases inserted
by adapting to the scope the Vorbrüggen protocol (Scheme 1).5,8

On pursuing our research in nitrosocarbonyl ene reactions, we set
up a reliable and robust methodology for the synthesis of the 5-hydroxy-isoxazolidines
required for the nucleoside preparation on suitable amounts to test
them for their potential biological activities and in particular to
verify their metabolic and induced cell death by apoptosis.

For the scope of the present work, we selected the compounds derived
from the ene reaction of the cinnamyl alcohol and the mesityl nitrosocarbonyl
intermediate. The choices of the mesityl group as a substituent for
the aromatic nitrosocarbonyl intermediate and of the cinnamyl alcohol
as an ene partner rely upon the following considerations: (i) nitrosocarbonyl
benzene reacts too fast not only with alkenes but also through dimerization
(i.e., decomposition) and can follow competitive pathways, such as
nucleophilic attack by the hydroxyl group of the allylic alcohol;
on the other side, the mesityl nitrosocarbonyl reacts more slowly
and is able to follow the AM reaction path required for the isoxazolidine
synthesis; (ii) although the use of a disubstituted allylic alcohol
may determine the activation of a competitive 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition
path, the choice of the cinnamyl alcohol also relies on the fact that
it has a single possibility of allylic hydrogen abstraction oriented
to the formation of the isoxazolidine ring. This simplifies the ene
reaction, and the introduction of the phenyl group in the position
3 of the isoxazolidine ring could help in the definition of the stereochemistry
of the nucleoside analogues. Previous observations showed that some
of the synthetized compounds displayed remarkable and interesting
activities. The results here obtained and their interpretation allows
for a structure–activity relationship (SAR) discussion, pointing
out the importance of the regiochemical outcome of the heterobase
functionalization of the 5-hydroxy-isoxazolidines. To do this specifically,
the Vorbrüggen protocol, suitably adapted to the reagents,
offers in a single reaction the possibility to insert an interesting
range of heterobases.

The choice of the 6-chloropurine, as a
versatile heterobase, was
determined by the opportunity offered by the ease substitution of
the chlorine atom with a variety of nucleophiles to investigate simple
structure modifications apt to tune properly the biological activity
of the stereo- and regioisomeric products, also in view of the SAR
discussion.

Results and Discussion
A dichloromethane (DCM solution
of mesitonitrile oxide (MNO) was added to a stirred solution
of N-methylmorpholine N-oxide (NMO,
1.1 equiv) in DCM in the presence of an excess
(5 equiv) of trans-cinnamyl alcohol, leaving the reaction mixture
overnight at room temperature (rt) (Scheme 2). The ene adduct 4 was isolated
upon chromatographic purification from the reaction mixture in 40%
yield. Besides the excess of cinnamyl alcohol, the mesitoic anhydride
was the major side product (38%) isolated from the reaction mixture
as a result of dimerization and rearrangement of the dimer of the
nitrosocarbonyl mesitylene 1M. The anhydrides are the
products of the dimerization process of nitrosocarbonyls when their
capture with dienes or enes is too slow, as demonstrated in previous
works.9 The slow reaction rate of the ene
reaction of the nitrosocarbonyl mesitylene 1M is also
confirmed by the fair yield of the isoxazolidine 4, obtained
as a result of the ene addition and formation of the enol intermediate 2 that undergoes tautomerism to the aldehyde 3 and subsequent cyclization.

Intermediate with the trans-Cinnamyl Alcohol
The ene adduct 4 was then acetylated according to
the established procedure above reported,10 and compound 5 was obtained in 80% yield as a mixture
of diastereoisomers in the same ratio (nearly 1:1) of the starting
material. The structure of 5 was confirmed by the relative
spectroscopic data; in the 1H NMR spectrum (CDCl3), the acetate group is clearly show by the singlet at 2.03 δ
corresponding to the methyl as well as by the presence in the infrared
(IR) spectrum of the C=O band at 1764 cm–1 and the absence of the OH band. The other signals are in the expected
range for the given isoxazolidine structure.

The analytical
and spectroscopic data of adduct 4 were
consistent with its existence as an inseparable mixture of diastereoisomers.
The IR spectrum shows the presence of the OH group with a band at
3368 cm–1. In the NMR spectra (CDCl3),
the mixture of diastereoisomers is clearly shown in the ratio 3:1.
Focusing the attention on the major diastereoisomer, the isoxazolidine
structure is confirmed by the presence in the 1H NMR spectrum
of the hemiacetal proton at 6.11 δ (d, J =
5 Hz) and the benzylic proton at 4.78 δ (t, J = 8 Hz), coupled with the methylene found at 2.48 and 2.82 δ
(m, 1H + 1H). In the 13C NMR spectrum, the hemiacetal carbon
atom is found at 98.3 δ and the other signals in the expected
range. The definitive confirmation of the structure of 4 came from the X-ray analysis, and Figure 1 reports the ORTEP view of the compound.

Figure 1 X-ray
structure of ene adduct 4.

We performed the functionalization of the isoxazolidine 5 with the commercially available 6-chloropurine by adapting
the standard
protocol for the insertion of heterobases on isoxazolidine rings.
In this case, we expect to have four derivatives because the purine
rings give two regioisomeric adducts at the N7 and N9 nitrogen atoms
on the two diastereoisomers.11

The
acetylated isoxazolidine 5 was added under nitrogen
atmosphere at rt to a solution of 6-chloropurine (2 equiv) and bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide
(BSA) (2 equiv), and the solutions became clear after boiling in DCM
for a couple of hours. The mixtures were then ice-cooled at 0 °C
and trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (TMSO-Tf; 1 equiv) was
added and the reactions refluxed overnight (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Synthesis of 6-Chloropurine Isoxazolidine-Nucleoside
Analogues through
Vorbrüggen Protocol
The desired compounds 6a–d were obtained
as
white solids separated by column chromatography. The purine nucleoside
analogues 6a–d were isolated in fair yields (range
25–35%). On the basis of previous observations,5,11 the reaction was conducted on the mixture of the diastereoisomeric
acetylated compounds 5 to give a mixture of four possible
diastereoisomeric products through the stabilized intermediate (see inset in Scheme 3). In fact, the purine ring can be linked at the isoxazolidine
moiety through the N7 and/or N9 nitrogen atoms. The stereochemical
outcome is in full accordance with Yadav’s and Woerpel’s
observations on the behavior of oxocarbenium ions, simply alkyl or
aryl substituted.12Table 1 reports the yields, physical–chemical
data, and the relevant 1H NMR spectroscopic data supporting
the structural assignments given in Scheme 3. Compounds 6a–d were
fully characterized, and their structures correctly attributed to
the cis- or trans-series; these labels refer to the stereochemical
relationship between the phenyl group and the purine ring located
on the isoxazolidine moiety. Compounds 6a,b, N9, and
N7 purine-linked, belong to the cis-series; in particular, the nuclear
overhauser spectroscopy (NOESY) experiment conducted on compound 6b allowed for the correct attribution of the cis relationship
between the above-cited groups on the isoxazolidine ring, as shown
by the nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) correlation indicated by red
arrows in Figure 2.
Compounds 6c,d, N9 and N7 purine-linked, belong to the
trans-series; in particular, the NOESY experiments performed on both
of the compounds gave successful results, and the structures in Figure 2 show the NOE correlations
between the marked protons. The attribution of the regiochemical arrangement
of the 6-chloropurine ring in the four compounds, although more intriguing,
was a challenging task.

After several attempts
to crystallize the four nucleoside analogues
to have single crystals for X-ray structural attributions; for one
of those 6a, we managed to obtain the expected result,
and the ORTEP view is shown in Figure 2. This structure and the NMR data and NOESY experiments
performed on all of the compounds 6a–d allowed
collecting the needed information to attribute unambiguously the structures
as reported in Scheme 3 and Figure 2.

Compounds 6a and 6c possess the purine
ring attached to the isoxazolidine ring through the N9 nitrogen of
the heterobase, whereas compounds 6b and 6d show the purine ring upside down because the attachment occurs through
the N7 nitrogen atom of the heterocyclic ring. These structural features
will be further considered in the discussion concerning the biological
data here presented.

Samples of compounds 6a–d were biologically
assayed to assess their proapoptotic, metabolic, and cytotoxic activities.
For the scope, the human monocytoid U937, and the lymphoblastoid MOLT-3
cell lines were grown in RPMI (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies),
2 mM glutamine (Hyclone, Cramlington, UK), 50 U/mL penicillin, and
50 U/mL streptomycin (HyClone), hereafter defined as CM. The metabolic
inhibition was evaluated by MTS assay. The compounds were added at
the range concentration from 80 to 2.5 μM. Inhibition of the
cell metabolic activity was detected through formazan product formation,
using a commercial colorimetric kit (MTS [3,4-(5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxy
methoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium salt]).13

The cytotoxic assay was carried on in
U937, MOLT-3 cell lines,
and stimulated mononuclear cells from healthy donors (PBMC) as control,
in the presence of compounds at 10, 5, and 2.5 μM concentration.
The evaluation of dead and living cells, respectively, was performed
by using the trypan blue dye exclusion test, after 24 h of culture.
As a drug control, it was used as a chemotherapeutic drug, etoposide,
at 10 μM concentration. The metabolic inhibition (MAIC50) and cytotoxicity (CC50) activity were expressed as concentration
inhibiting 50% of the activity ± standard deviation (SD).

Apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry analysis of isolated nuclei
after staining with propidium iodide, as previously described.14 The tested compounds 6a–d exhibited different abilities to induce cell death by apoptosis,
to inhibit metabolic activity and cell growth (Table 2). All of the four compounds induced apoptosis,
expressed as a percentage of hypodiploid nuclei, in dose effect, although 6a and 6d at higher level than 6b and 6c and close to that induced by etoposide (63 ±
0.01 and 55 ± 2.4). Conversely, the compounds 6b, an N7cis compound, and 6c, an N9trans compound, hence showing opposite localizations of
chlorine atom, inhibited metabolic activity of U937 and MOLT-3 cells
(MAIC50) at higher concentration in comparison with compounds 6a and 6d, which showed phenyl in cis and trans,
respectively, but with different match with the position of chlorine
substitution (see structures in Scheme 3). This indicates that 6a and 6d show higher level of proapoptotic activity and metabolic inhibition
than that of 6b and 6c toward tumor cells,
respectively.

On the other side, the cytotoxicity (CC50) toward both
tumor cell lines was as follows: 6a > 6d > 6c > 6b, showing that the N9cis (6a) compound was more cytotoxic than
that corresponding
with N7cis (6b) and the compounds of
the trans series located in between. Collectively, the induction of
apoptosis and/or the inhibition of metabolic and cytotoxic activity
of the tested compounds at 10 μM were similar to that exhibited
by the positive control etoposide. Assays on stimulated PBMC were
carried on to investigate the metabolic and the cytotoxic inhibitory
activity of the compounds versus normal cells. The results indicated
that 6b was the least cytotoxic showing MAIC50 of 35 ± 0.9 SD, whereas 6c and 6d showed 15.4 ± 0.6 and 15.0 ± 2.1 SD, respectively.

Conversely, 6a showed a MAIC50 of 3.6 ± 0.6 SD.
Anyhow, the compounds 6b, 6c, and 6d were low metabolic inhibitors than etoposide. Similarly,
the compounds 6b and 6c exhibited lower
cytotoxic activity versus stimulated PBMC than that of 6a and 6d. Interestingly 6b–d inhibited
PBMC metabolism and 6a–d cytotoxicity at lower
level, respectively, in comparison with etoposide.

Taken together,
the biological assays have shown that all of the
four tested compounds were endowed with antitumor activity. Nevertheless
their antitumor activity cannot be ascribed exclusively to a mechanism
of programmed cell death because the compounds endowed with higher
proapoptotic activity also showed higher metabolic and cytotoxic activity
toward tumor cells. The encouraging aspect is that the general toxicity
versus healthy cells is lower than that exhibited by etoposide. In
terms of SAR, it can be hypothesized that the stoichiometric structure
including the substitution of chlorine atom versus nitrogen associated
to phenyl group in cis and/or in trans might influence the apoptotic
and metabolic activity of the compounds toward U937, MOLT-3 cells,
and normal tissues.

To shed some light on a tentative SAR for
the compounds at hand,
we have observed the four racemic compounds 6a–d from the conformational point of view by performing ab initio calculations
by means of density functional theory methods at the B3LYP(6-31G)
(d,p) level.15Figures 3 and 4 show the gas-phase-optimized
conformations divided into two main sets: (1) in Figure 3, structures of the cis series
of compounds 6a,b and (2) in Figure 4, structures of the trans series of compounds 6c,d. The reported structures, the most populated according
to the Boltzmann distribution, show in some cases the 6-chloropurine
ring in pseudo-equatorial positions and in other cases the same heterobase
in pseudo-axial positions; they are reported along with the relative
energies (ΔE, kcal/mol) relative to the most
stable structure 6a (ΔE = 0.00
kcal/mol).

Figure 3 Derivatives of the cis series of compounds 6a,b.

Figure 4 Derivatives of the trans series of compounds 6c,d.

Compound 6a is the most stable of all compounds and
belongs to the N9 derivative series; it is reasonably stabilized by
nonclassical intramolecular H-bond between the purine H–C=N
proton and the phenyl ring, as shown in Figure 3, with distances in Å. The other structures 6a′, 6a″, and 6a′″ were located at higher energies because they lack intramolecular
stabilizing effects. Compound 6a shows the 6-chloropurine
ring in the pseudoequatorial position. The same cis series includes
the N7 derivatives: 6b (the most stable of the group)
is 5.02 kcal/mol higher than 6a. All of the other structures 6b′, 6b,″ and 6b′″ showed some steric destabilizing effects
because of the mesityl methyls groups pointing to other parts of the
molecules.

Close in energy, the N9 derivatives of the trans
series show the
structure 6c as the most stable and closest in energy
to 6a. Again, 6c shows the 6-chloropurine
ring in the pseudo-equatorial position. The other structures 6c′, 6c″, and 6c′″ are located at higher energies up to 2 kcal/mol. Similarly as before,
the N7 derivatives of the trans series show higher energies with respect
to the N9 ones but the most stable of them is 6d that
shows the 6-chloropurine ring in the pseudo-axial position; partially
π–π stacking interactions between the 6-chloropurine
ring and the mesitoyl substituent can act as stabilizing effects.

Previously described biological data somewhat locate the four compounds 6a–d activities into two groups of two compounds each: 6a/6d and 6b/6c. Taking
this into account, some of the structures reported in Figures 3 and 4 can be overlapped evidencing interesting and quite unexpected similarities
between different diaestereoisomers. Figure 5 shows the best fittings between the reported
optimized structures that includes 6a″ + 6d″ and 6b + 6c′.
In the 6a″ + 6d″ case, the
N–O bond in the isoxazolidine ring overlaps, and a good overlap
is also found for the entire heterocyclic ring. The two phenyl rings
are also nicely overlapped, whereas the fitting of the two structures
is less efficient for the mesitoyl group. The two 6-chloropurine rings
are located in two different positions in the two compounds. In 6a″, the purine ring points the chlorine atom in the
outer space from an equatorial position, whereas in 6d″, it is found trans to the phenyl rings in the axial position, orienting
the chlorine atom in nearly the same plane of the isoxazolidine ring.
The locations of the 6-chloropurines strongly discriminate between
the two compounds, which have indeed different activities.

Figure 5 Overlap of
the 6a″ + 6d″ and 6b + 6c′ optimized structures.

In the 6b + 6c′ case, the
N–O
bond in the isoxazolidine ring and the entire isoxazolidine ring are
totally overlapped. The fittings of both the two phenyl and the mesitoyl
groups are excellent. On the other hand, the two 6-chloropurine rings
are both located equatorially to the isoxazolidine ring, both pointing
to the chlorine atom downward and opposite to the phenyl rings. In
this case, the two structures overlap the evidence with more similarities
between them.

From these observations, the main differences
remain between 6a and 6d: the positions
of the 6-chloropurine
rings are discriminant between the two structures even when a good
overlap can be found between the other parts of the molecules. Fewer
differences can be found between compounds 6b and 6c. These statements nicely fit with the biological data and
with possibility to tune the proapoptotic activity and cytotoxicity
by modifying the structures at the level of the chlorine atom or alternatively
at the level of the aromatic rings.

These and further modifications
of the described molecules are
indeed desirable to increase the antitumor effect and decrease the
off-target activity. We are actively pursuing the syntheses of novel
nucleoside analogues by applying the same nitrosocarbonyl chemistry.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have investigated the ene reactions of nitrosocarbonyl
mesitylene, generated through the mild oxidative protocol with NMO,
with cinnamyl alcohol. The fast oxidation process of nitrile oxide
to nitrosocarbonyl intermediate prevents a possible side reaction,
that is, the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition.16 From the reaction mixtures, the presence of adducts between the
aromatic nitrile oxide and the cinnamyl alcohol was not observed in
isolable amounts, even in crude mixtures.

The nitrosocarbonyl
mesitylene 1M adds the cinnamyl
alcohol affording a single adduct 5 that derives from
the C3 addition to the alcohol in the ene reaction.5

The purine functionalization of 5 proceeds
as expected,
furnishing four compounds 6a–d whose structures
were attributed with the help of NMR experiments and X-ray diffractometry.
The biological tests reveal that all of the four compounds induced
apoptosis, expressed as percentage of hypodiploid nuclei, in dose
effect, although 6a and 6d are at higher
levels than 6b and 6c.

The cytotoxicity
toward both tumor cell lines was as follows: 6a > 6d > 6c > 6b,
showing that the N9cis (6a) compound
was more cytotoxic than that the corresponding N7cis (6b) and the compounds of the trans series located
in between. Collectively, the induction of apoptosis and/or the inhibition
of metabolic and cytotoxic activity of the tested compounds at 10
μM were similar to that exhibited by the positive control etoposide.

In terms of SAR, it can be hypothesized that the stoichiometric
structure including the substitution of chlorine atom versus nitrogen
associated with the phenyl group in cis and/or in trans might influence
the apoptotic and metabolic activity of the compounds toward U937,
MOLT-3 cells, and normal tissues.

Ene Reaction of Nitrosocarbonyl
Mesitylene 1M with
Cinnamyl Alcohol
To an ice-cooled DCM (200 mL) solution of
cinnamyl alcohol (32 mL, 5 equiv), 8.73 g (1.5 equiv) of NMO was added
under stirring. A solution of 8.01 g (50 mmol) of MNO in 200 mL of DCM was added dropwise, and the reaction was left under
stirring at rt for 24 h. After dilution with an equivalent volume
of DCM, the organic phase was washed with water and dried over anhydrous
Na2SO4. After filtration, the solvent was then
evaporated, and the reaction mixture separated on column chromatography,
affording the ene adduct 4 as an inseparable mixture
of diastereoisomers in the ratio 3:1. In the NMR spectra of 4, the signals of the minor diastereoisomer are reported in
brackets.

Synthesis of the N-Mesitoyl-3-phenyl-5-acetoxy-1,2-isoxazolidine 5
To an ice-cooled anhydrous DCM (150 mL) solution
of N-mesitoyl-3-methyl-5-hydroxy-1,2-isoxazolidine 4 (1.00 g, 12.4 mmol), 2.2 equiv of Ac2O were added
under stirring along with 0.2 equiv of DMAP and 2.2 equiv of Et3N. The reaction is left under stirring at rt for 24 h. After
dilution with an equivalent volume of DCM, the organic phase was washed
with a saturated solution of NaHCO3 and dried over anhydrous
Na2SO4. After filtration, the solvent was evaporated
and an oily residue is obtained corresponding to the inseparable mixture
of the two diastereoisomers 5, purified by column chromatography
and fully characterized. In the NMR spectra of 5, the

Synthesis of Nucleosides 6a–d by Coupling
of Isoxazolidine 5 and 6-Chloropurine
A solution
of 2 equiv of 6-chloropurine (0.32 g, 2.06 mmol) and 2 equiv of BSA
in anhydrous DCM (20 mL) is refluxed under nitrogen atmosphere for
1 h. An additional equivalent of BSA is added, and the mixture is
refluxed until it becomes clear and hence cooled to ambient temperature.
A solution in DCM (10 mL) of isoxazolidine 5 (0.37 g,
1.04 mmol) is added dropwise and cooled to 0 °C along with an
addition of 0.20 mL (1 equiv) of TMSO-Tf. The reaction is refluxed
under stirring overnight and finally quenched with a saturated solution
of NaHCO3 at pH = 7. The mixture is diluted with an equivalent
volume of DCM and washed with water and finally dried over Na2SO4. From the residues, nucleosides 6a–d are isolated through column chromatography (chloroform and chloroform/methanol
were used as eluants) and fully characterized.
