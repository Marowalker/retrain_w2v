Although template-assisted self-assembly
methods are very popular
in materials and biological systems, they have certain limitations
such as lack of tunability and switchable functionality because of
the irreversible association of cells and their matrix components.
With an aim to achieve more tunability, we have made an attempt to
investigate the self-assembly behavior of rod-shaped living bacteria
subjected to an external alternating electric field using confocal
microscopy. We demonstrate that rod-shaped living bacteria dispersed
in a low salinity aqueous medium form different types of reversible
freely suspended structures when subjected to an external alternating
electric field. At low field strength, an oriented phase is observed
where individual bacterium orients with its major axis aligned along
the field direction. At intermediate field strength, bacteria align
in the form of one-dimensional (1D) chains that lie along the field
direction. Further, at high field strength, more bacteria associate
with these 1D chains laterally to form a two-dimensional (2D) array.
At higher bacterial concentration, these field-induced 2D arrays extend
to form three-dimensional columnar structures. These results are discussed
in the context of previously reported studies on bacterial self-assembly.

Introduction
Studying self-assembly
behavior in live bacterial cells of different
shapes and sizes can lead to designing new biomaterials with interesting
structural properties. So far, most of the studies on bacterial organizations
are template-based, where liquid crystals,1,2 DNA,3,4 nanowires,5 or surfaces6 act as physical templates. Although template-based methods
are also very popular in the area of nanoparticle assemblies7−9 and produce highly ordered permanent structures, they have certain
limitations such as switchable functionality with rapid and reversible
action.

On the other hand, in a template-free method, the self-assembly
processes are studied in a bulk medium without the use of any physical
template and the assembly processes can be controlled by parameters
such as particle density, temperature, pH, and electric and magnetic
fields. External electric or magnetic field has advantages over other
parameters with respect to fast switching on/off action. Moreover,
the self-assembly can be tuned statically or dynamically. Although
external fields have been used extensively to study phase transitions
and related self-assembly in different types of colloidal or nanoparticle
systems,10−17 their use in the self-assembly of biological cells is very rare.18−21 Velev group18 have studied field-induced
coassembly of particles with yeast and fibroblast cells in the low
frequency range (hertz to kilohertz), where they have found one-dimensional
(1D) chains and two-dimensional (2D) arrays. Kang and Dhont19,20 have investigated electric-field-induced phase transitions of fd
virus at low ionic strength and at low frequency (hertz to kilohertz
range). These studies have observed various interesting phases such
as nematic, striped, and a dynamical state. To our knowledge, no studies
have been carried out yet on template-free assembly of micron-size
living bacterial cells under an external alternating electric field
(ac). Living bacterial cells can be considered to be complex dielectric
particles22 containing different components
such as vacuoles, nucleoid flagella, membrane, and so forth. Therefore,
the dielectric contributions from these components and their intricate
interplay with an external ac could generate novel field-induced structures.
In addition, we know that many bacteria form biofilms while adapting
to their host environment and experience isotropic and anisotropic
forces that arise from the interacting environment itself.4,23 Hence, self-assembly of bacteria under an external electric field
could be a good model to address how these anisotropic forces influence
structural and dynamic properties of bacterial assembly.

Results and Discussion
Zero-Field
Characterizations of Bacterial Suspension
In the current
study, we use green-fluorescence-protein-tagged rod-shaped Salmonella Typhimurium (Strain SB300)24,25 bacterium with an average aspect ratio (L/d) of 5 ± 1 (L is length = 2.5 ±
0.9 μm and d is width = 0.5 ± 0.3 μm).
From dynamic light-scattering studies, the estimated average hydrodynamic
radius and polydispersity are 1176 nm and 15%, respectively (see Figure S2 for details). The details of bacterial
culture preparation, its characterization, and the growth curve are
provided in Supporting Information. All
our field experiments are carried out by collecting samples from the
stationary phase (at 16 h) of growth culture (see Figure S1A). The bacterial samples were purified by washing
several times with deionized Milli-Q water by centrifugation at 3000
rpm. Ion-exchange resins were added to further deionize the bacterial
suspension. Under deionized state, bacterial cells have a zeta potential
of −30 mV (see Figure S1B). The
field studies are carried out at room temperature (T = 20 °C). Importantly, we make sure that bacterial growth is
restricted in deionized aqueous medium, and the field values are low
enough to not damage or kill the cells. We implement two different
schemes for our field experiments carried out using confocal microscope.
Usually, the microscopy resolution along z is poorer
than the xy resolution. Therefore, a fully three
dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the structure and viewing it along
the field direction are very challenging using Scheme 2. Hence, we use Scheme 1 to perform field experiments with the field
along the x direction.

Scheme 1 AC Field Is Applied
in the Image Plane along the x-Axis as Shown in the
Figure
Bacterial suspension is kept
between two cover slips separated by a spacer of thickness 120 micron.
One of the cover slips is coated with conductive indium tin oxide
(ITO) layer and is etched with a gap of 1.2 mm. Under an ac field,
bacteria align along the field direction in the form of chains, and
we see them in the image plane itself. The z-axis
is perpendicular to the image (xy) plane.

Electric Field Studies
All our field
experiments are
carried out at a fixed frequency of 2 MHz by varying bacterial concentration
and electric field strength. From our frequency-dependence studies
at constant electric field strength, we have verified that the field-induced
structure formations are stronger above 1 MHz (see Figure S3).

By lowering the frequency, the structures
become weak and start melting at around 900–800 kHz. Upon further
lowering the frequency, the elongated structures completely melt at
around 150 kHz, and all bacteria with their long axis remain oriented
along the field direction.

In a deionized suspension, bacteria
have surface charges. It is
possible that in the low frequency regime (in the kilohertz regime),
the double-layer polarization dominates as the diffuse charge clouds
around the bacterial cells follow the alternating cycle. Electric field-induced phase transitions due to double-layer polarizations
(in the kilohertz regime) can also be seen in other systems13,15,18,19 such as colloids, fd viruses, and cells. However, at a high frequency
(in the megahertz range), the double-layer charges do not respond
and only dielectric polarizations occur as mentioned in earlier electric
field studies on colloidal systems.12,16 In the previous
theoretical studies, biological cells are often modeled as dielectric
particles covered with a membrane.26,27 The effective
permittivity of the whole cell is due to the contributions from the
permittivity of cytoplasm and membrane.

Therefore, it is likely
that the dielectric polarization in the
megahertz regime is a contribution of polarizations of the different
components of bacterial cells including the membranes. However, to
understand the details of the frequency-dependent mechanisms of polarization
in our bacterial suspension, we will need to carry out impedance spectroscopy:
such studies are planned for the future. In the current study, we
look at the electric field assembly only at a fixed frequency of 2
MHz.

The field experiments performed as outlined in Scheme 1 are demonstrated
in Figures 1 and 2 at a bacterial concentration of 0.06 and 0.29 wt
%, respectively.
At zero-field (E = 0), bacterial cells are diffusive
and are distributed isotropically, which is evident from 2D CLSM images
and their FT (the image at E = 0 in Figures 1 and 2). At low field values, individual bacterium with its long axis orients
along the field direction. The deviation from a zero-field isotropic
ordering is clearly visible from the FT of its corresponding images
(images at E = 0.0035 and 0.009 in Figures 1 and 2, respectively). This oriented phase has also been observed in other
bacterial systems in a template assembly using DNA matrix3 or liquid crystal.2 This phase mimics paranematic ordering that has been observed in
rod-shaped synthetic colloids under an external electric field.16 At E = 0.01 Vrms/μm, the oriented bacteria form 1D chains along the field direction
(Figure 1). These freely
suspended chains break and again form spontaneously because of the
competition between thermal fluctuation (on the order of kBT) and weak dipolar interaction. In
chains, bacteria arrange in a zigzag manner at an average angle of
θ = 18° ± 1° with the applied field direction
to minimize the energy and maximize the attraction between dipoles
(as shown in the inset image at E = 0.01 in Figure 1). In the case of
spherical particles under an external alternating field, the minimum
energy (maximum attraction) occurs when the induced dipoles align
along the field direction at an angle of θ = 0.12,13 However, for anisotropic particles under an external electric field,
the energy minimization for maximum dipolar attraction always occurs
at θ > 0 as per previous experimental and theoretical studies.15−17 The value of θ varies depending upon the aspect ratio. These
field-induced structures form instantaneously when the field is on
and redisperse again to the homogeneous isotropic phase when the field
is switched off. A demonstration of such reversibility is shown in Movie S1.

suspension (at a concentration of 0.06 wt %) at different field strengths E (Vrms/μm). The two-headed arrow indicates
the field direction E. Gravity, g, is perpendicular to E. The Fourier transformations
(FTs) of the corresponding images are shown as an inset (scale bar
= 5 μm). The inset figures at E = 0.01 and
0.018 Vrms/μm are the magnified images of a string
and 2d array, respectively. The schematic image (right side) demonstrates
the different steps of structure formation with increasing field strength
from the top to bottom.

Figure 2 2D CLSM images of bacterial suspension (at the concentration of
0.29 wt %) at different field strengths. The FTs of the corresponding
images are shown as an inset (scale bar = 5 μm). CLSM image
(right side) corresponds to magnified version of a single column.

With further increase in electric
field strength to E = 0.018 Vrms/μm
(see Figure 1), more
bacteria associate laterally with
the 1D chains to form a 2D structure where each bacterium is surrounded
by four nearest neighbors. Similar 2D arrays have also been observed
at the higher bacterial concentration of 0.29 wt % (see the first
image at E = 0.021 Vrms/μm in Figure 2). In the later stage,
we observe that as a function of time, these 2D structures grow and
combine with other 2D structures to form large extended structures
that mimic columns (see the second image at E = 0.021
Vrms/μm in Figure 2). The magnified image of a single column is shown
in Figure 2. Even in
some cases, where the samples are kept for a longer period under constant
field values, the columns are found to span both sides of electrodes.
The average width of these columns varies from 3 to 5 microns at this
concentration. Bragg diffraction spots in the FT image of the columns
(inset FT image at E = 0.021 Vrms/μm)
indicate a crystalline arrangement of bacteria within a single column.
This crystalline order is very clear when we look at the columnar
structures at further high bacterial concentration.

In the next
step, we obtain a 3D overview of these columnar structures
by carrying out the field experiments at a comparable bacterial concentration
as per Scheme 2. The field-induced structural ordering of
bacteria in the xy-image plane perpendicular to the
field direction (along z) is shown in Figure 3A. At zero-field (E = 0), rod-shaped bacteria are diffusive and distributed in a homogeneous
manner, which is consistent with the observations in Scheme 1. At a low field strength,
the oriented bacteria and the bacterial chains look like spheres in
the image plane (the second image at E = 0.01 of Figure 3A). With further
increase in field strength, we see the formation of clusters and the
size of these clusters (i.e., the width of the columnar phase) increases
with increase in the field strength from E = 0.015
to 0.02 Vrms/μm (see Figure 3A). The 3D overview of these columnar structures
is constructed from several 2D images along the z-axis at E = 0.02 Vrms/μm, and
the corresponding 3D image is shown in Figure 3B. Hence, we demonstrate that the columnar
structures that we see in an xy-plane (in Figure 2) using Scheme 1 are 2D representations
of 3D columnar structures that are elongated along the z-axis when we view along the field direction using Scheme 2.

different field strengths at a bacterial
concentration of 0.25 wt %. The electric field is perpendicular to
the image plane as per Scheme 2. (B) 3D image of the columnar phase (at E = 0.02 Vrms/μm) constructed from several 2D images

The schematic in panel (B) represents that the oriented bacteria along
the field direction are packed in a columnar structure. The two-headed
arrow represents the field direction.

Scheme 2 Bacterial Suspension Is Kept between Two ITO-Coated Cover Slips
Separated
by a Spacer of 120 μm
We view the structure
along the
applied electric field direction (along z), which
is perpendicular to the image (xy) plane. Under an
ac field, bacteria align along the field direction and look spherical
in the image plane as shown in the schematic.

We further look at the field-induced assembly at a very high bacterial
concentration of 2.9 wt % (see Figure 4). At this high bacterial concentration, the zero-field
structure is purely isotropic as is evident from the inset FT of the
2D CLSM image at E = 0 (see Figure 4). With increasing field strength, we find
transition from isotropic to columnar phase at E =
0.02 Vrms/μm via an oriented phase at E = 0.005 Vrms/μm (see Figure 4). No intermediate chain phase is observed
at this high bacterial concentration. The width of the columns varies
between 15 and 20 microns. Moreover, in the columnar phase, we now
clearly see the ordered arrangement of bacteria with centered rectangular
unit cell, where a single bacterium is surrounded by four bacteria
with average lattice constants a = 1.1 ± 0.3
μm and b = 3.5 ± 1 μm (see the high
and low magnification images at E = 0.02 in Figure 4). The FT of this
image exhibits distinct diffraction spots, which is evidence for the
presence of long-range order. However, due to the high degree of polydispersity,
Bragg spots are not very sharp and no higher-order reflections are
observed. We could not pursue further quantitative characterizations
on this crystalline phase.

Figure 4 2D CLSM images of the field-induced structure
formation in bacterial
suspension at a high concentration of 2.9 wt %. At E = 0.02 Vrms/μm, two images correspond to high and
low zooms, respectively. The two-headed arrow indicates the field
direction E. Gravity, g, is perpendicular
to E. The FTs of the corresponding images are shown
as an inset. The scale bar indicates 5 micron.

We now summarize our experimental results through a qualitative
phase diagram as a function of electric field strength and bacterial
cell concentrations (see Figure 5). One can notice that at a given cell concentration,
the structure formation under the ac field mostly depends on the strength
of dipole moments, which can be tuned by changing the electric field
strength. At a low concentration, the transition from the zero-field
randomly oriented isotropic phase to the oriented phase is obtained
above the field strength of E > 0.002 Vrms/μm. When the field strength is further increased, 1D chains
and 2D arrays are formed above E > 0.009 and 0.016
Vrms/μm, respectively. At a higher bacterial concentration
of 0.29 wt %, the boundary of oriented phase slightly shifts to lower
field values. This may be because the oriented phase is already favored
at higher bacterial concentration. Thus, a lower field strength is
required to orient the rod-shaped bacteria. It seems that the chain
regime gets narrower with increasing bacterial concentration. For
the highest bacterial concentration (at 2.9 wt %), we find almost
no intermediate chains and the oriented phase directly undergoes a
transition to the columnar phase.

that form at different bacterial
cell concentrations under an ac field at a frequency of 2 MHz.

It must be noted that we currently
know neither the details of
effective interparticle interactions between bacteria in the presence
of an external electric field nor the frequency-dependent polarization
mechanisms: both are necessary to know the details of mechanisms that
govern the concentration-dependent electric-field-induced structure
formation in our bacterial system. To understand the frequency-dependent
polarization mechanisms, impedance spectroscopy will be carried out
in future. We also plan to examine, in a future study, the effective
interparticle interactions between bacteria under the presence of
an external electric field.

In the present case, we can nevertheless
discuss our experimental
results based on the existing theoretical/simulation studies on related
topics. The oriented and the chain phases that we have observed in
our electric field experiments have been explained in earlier theoretical/simulation
work on the behavior of biological cells under an external ac electric
field. In these studies, the biological cells are modeled as particles
covered with shells, and the interactions among the cells are treated
in the dipole approximation.26,27 In the Brownian dynamics
simulation work of Llamas et al.,27 each
cell (of spherical shape) is subjected to various forces such as electrical
dipolar interaction, a short-range repulsive interaction, a viscous
force, and a Brownian force. Through simulation, they observe two
regimes: first, the cells form linear chains under an external electric
field, and second, the chains condense into columnar structures. Although
there is a qualitative agreement with respect to the formation of
chains and columns, the exact structures of their chains and columns
are different from ours because of different shapes. Moreover, these
studies are limited to dilute concentration, and no such phase diagram
between electric field strength and cell concentrations has been considered
that can be used as a reference to understand our experimental results.

On the other hand, to a first approximation, if bacteria can be
considered to be polarizable rods, then some of our results can be
qualitatively compared with the past Monte Carlo simulations of monodisperse
polarizable hard rod (of aspect ratio = 5, which is similar to that
in our case) based on a double-charge model.28 The simulation studies have predicted a phase diagram as a function
of electric field strength and rod volume fraction, which contains
a variety of stable phases such as nematic, strings (or chains), smectic
A, smectic C, columnar, and other crystal phases AAA, HSC, X, and
ABC. The observations of nematic and chains at low volume fraction
and columns at high volume fraction in their simulation studies are
qualitatively similar to our experimental findings where we see an
oriented phase and chain phase at low bacterial concentration and
a columnar phase at high bacterial concentration. However, in our
experiments, we do not observe other higher-order stable phases such
as smectic A, smectic B, and so forth as seen in the simulated phase
diagram of hard rods. There may be different reasons for this disagreement.
First, the interaction potential could be different. In the case of
bacteria, the interaction potential is expected to be much softer
than the polarizable hard rods. Second, the rod-shaped bacteria exhibit
polydispersity in size. These may be the reasons why we do not observe
higher-order crystalline phases in our bacterial systems. This is
also true based on other earlier simulation studies29 on polydisperse rod particles in the limit of infinite
aspect ratio, where it has been shown that with a polydispersity of
more than 18%, only nematic and columnar phases are stable, whereas
smectic phase is not.

Finally,
it is important to discuss our observed results with respect
to the similar studies previously reported on bacterial assembly.
The oriented phase (similar to paranematic-like ordering), which we
observe because of induced dipolar forces, had also been noticed in
other living bacterial cells, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In this work, the oriented phase was achieved through the elastic
forces exerted by templated liquid crystalline (LC) matrix of concentrated
DNA.3 In another study, it was also shown
that Proteus mirabilis-flhDC bacterial
cells associate to form 1D chains mediated by elastic forces from
lyotropic nematic LC matrix.2 In a very
recent work, nanowire arrays have been used as a matrix to obtain
bacterial assembly (Sporomusa ovata cells) through an electrostatic interaction of bacteria with nanowires.5 However, in all of these studies, the concentration
of bacterial cells is too low to observe any large aggregates of bacteria
forming any ordered structures. Moreover, these self-assembly methods
do not have switchable functionality with an on/off action. It is
also worth noting that the field-induced columnar structures, which
we observe for the first time in our experiments, can mimic those
detected in other biological systems such as rod viruses30 and DNA31 at larger
concentrations. The advantages
in our case are that these columnar phases can also be generated at
low bacterial concentration using an external ac electric field and
that the structures are fully reversible.

Conclusions and Outlook
We believe that our results unambiguously demonstrate how an external
field can be used in a living bacterial system to generate different
types of structures at varying length and time scales. Formation of
quick and reversible structures in bacterial cells in the presence
of an external ac electric field is very similar to electrorheological
(ER) materials.32 Earlier electric field
studies12−18 on different synthetic particles of different shapes have already
shown the formations of 1D chains, 2D and 3D crystals and their potential
applicability as model systems for ER fluids. The combined action
of electrical and rheological properties of ER fluids has been proposed
for applications in many devices such as clutches, brakes, valves,
and photonics. On the other hand, some of the recent studies18 have demonstrated the design of novel hybrid
biomaterials of 1D chain, 2D array composed of biological cells, and
synthetic colloids, which will have potential applications in biosensors.

We thus believe that our studies on the field-induced structure
formations in bacterial cells may help further to designing more complex
hybrid biomaterials for specific biosensor applications. Because the
structure formation does not require any genetic modification or re-engineering,
our methods can also be applied to different shapes of bacteria and
can also be combined with different types of functional colloids to
design novel structures. Apart from this, our methods can also find
interest in tissue engineering33 and construction
of model biofilms34 where cells of different
types can be assembled into 1D, 2D, or 3D structures under an external
ac electric field to construct artificial tissue.
