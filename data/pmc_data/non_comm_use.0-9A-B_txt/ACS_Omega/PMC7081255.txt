Human
pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocytes (hPSC-HEP) display
many properties of mature hepatocytes, including expression of important
genes of the drug metabolizing machinery, glycogen storage, and production
of multiple serum proteins. To this date, hPSC-HEP do not, however,
fully recapitulate the complete functionality of in vivo mature hepatocytes.
In this study, we applied versatile bioinformatic algorithms, including
functional annotation and pathway enrichment analyses, transcription
factor binding-site enrichment, and similarity and correlation analyses,
to datasets collected from different stages during hPSC-HEP differentiation
and compared these to developmental stages and tissues from fetal
and adult human liver. Our results demonstrate a high level of similarity
between the in vitro differentiation of hPSC-HEP and in vivo hepatogenesis.
Importantly, the transcriptional correlation of hPSC-HEP with adult
liver (AL) tissues was higher than with fetal liver (FL) tissues (0.83
and 0.70, respectively). Functional data revealed mature features
of hPSC-HEP including cytochrome P450 enzymes activities and albumin
secretion. Moreover, hPSC-HEP showed expression of many genes involved
in drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. Despite
the high similarities observed, we identified differences of specific
pathways and regulatory players by analyzing the gene expression between
hPSC-HEP and AL. These findings will aid future intervention and improvement
of in vitro hepatocyte differentiation protocol in order to generate
hepatocytes displaying the complete functionality of mature hepatocytes.
Finally, on the transcriptional level, our results show stronger correlation
and higher similarity of hPSC-HEP to AL than to FL. In addition, potential
targets for further functional improvement of hPSC-HEP were also identified.

Introduction
Human pluripotent stem
cell-derived hepatocytes (hPSC-HEP) are
an attractive cell source for in vitro applications, such as disease
modeling, studies on drug metabolism and drug targets, safety assessment,
viral studies, and also for use in regenerative medicine. Currently
used primary hepatocytes suffer from limited availability, short life
span, dedifferentiation, and loss of important metabolic functions
in vitro. hPSC-HEP share many features with their in vivo counterparts,
and recent improvement of differentiation protocols simulating liver
development has allowed the generation of cells with improved hepatocyte
functionality.1 However, to completely
replace the currently used cell sources, the hPSC-HEP need further
refinement.2,3

There are reports in the literature
describing knowledge-based
approaches for functional improvement of hPSC-HEP. For instance, Zhao
et al. observed that hepatoblasts obtained according to a previous
hepatocyte differentiation protocol did not express hepatocyte nuclear
protein 6 (HNF6) and prospero homeobox 1 (PROX1), as would be expected during liver development. They
then modified their differentiation protocol, which resulted in the
expression of HNF6 and PROX1 in
addition to HNF1A and CCAAT enhancer binding protein
alpha (CEBPA) and the subsequently improved expression
of transporters and drug-metabolizing enzymes in the produced hepatocytes.1 Other researchers reported that hPSC-HEP have
mixed features of liver, intestine, fibroblast, and stem cells,2 or that hPSC-HEP have major similarity to fetal
liver (FL), rather than to adult liver (AL).4

Most of the liver volume (70–85%) is made up by hepatocytes,5 and these cells are responsible for key liver
functions, including protein secretion, bile secretion, detoxification,
urea metabolism, glucose/glycogen metabolism and storage, and cholesterol
metabolism as well as secretion of clotting factors and acute phase
response.6 Detoxification is a major function
of hepatocytes and is conducted by a set of proteins involved in absorption,
distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of compounds, including
phase I and phase II xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes and phase III
transporters. The ADME functionality is of high importance when considering
the employment of hPSC-HEP in drug discovery and ToxSafety. However,
several ADME genes have, until now, shown low or no expression in
hPSC-HEP. Therefore, improving the expression of these genes in hPSC-HEP
is of critical importance for such applications.

In the present
study, we analyzed transcriptomics data from one
dataset, including hPSC-HEP generated by a standardized protocol,7−9 with human AL tissue as the control, and integrated this with the
data obtained from human FL and AL tissues from another dataset to
identify similarities and differences between in vivo- and in vitro-derived
hepatocytes. Importantly, the hPSC-HEP analyzed in this study showed
higher transcriptional similarity and correlation with AL than with
FL. Moreover, the functionality of hPSC-HEP was confirmed by measuring
the drug-metabolizing activity of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, the
secretion of albumin, and the production of urea. In addition, many
pathways involved in the functionality of hepatocytes and important
transcription factors (TFs) regulating hepatocyte maturity were identified
in the hPSC-HEP by applying bioinformatic analysis on our generated
transcriptomics dataset including both hPSC-HEP and two biological
control samples from AL.

Results
Mapping of in Vitro Differentiation
to in Vivo Developmental
Stages
In order to map the different stages of in vitro differentiation
to different stages of in vivo liver development, data from FL and
AL from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (accession number:
GSE61279) were merged with our dataset (E-MTAB-5367), and the hPSC-HEP
were mapped to the corresponding in vivo developmental stages based
on correlation with the gene expression. Only FL from male human embryonic
development at gestation weeks 8–9, 11–12, and 21 and
AL from males of age 22–38 years (with accident as cause of
death) were selected from the GSE61279 dataset and merged with our
transcriptional dataset from in vitro hepatocyte differentiation.
In total, 12922 genes were included in the merged dataset. To reduce
batch effects between these datasets, the merged dataset was normalized
by applying the COMBAT software.10 Boxplots
and hierarchical clustering analysis of the merged and normalized
datasets validated successful integration of the two datasets (Figures S1 and 1 respectively).
Interestingly, the results showed clustering of hepatoblasts and hPSC-HEP
on day 25 closer to AL than to FL (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Hierarchical clustering of the merged dataset
grouped data into
distinct clusters of hPSC (d0), DE (d5), hepatoblasts (d14), hPSC-HEP
(d25), human FL tissues, and human AL tissues. AL_26y and AL_29y in
the red marked cluster of AL samples are from the E-MTAB-5367 dataset,
and the rest of the AL samples are from the GSE61279 dataset. Despite
different platforms used, all nine samples from the adult liver clustered
tight together.

Both the correlation analysis
and the analysis of similarity on
the gene expression level were performed with concordant results.
First, Spearman’s correlation was calculated between each in
vitro time point and the FL at weeks 8–9, 11–12, and
21 as well as the AL. Remarkably, the results showed that in vitro-derived
hPSC-HEP d25 and hepatoblasts have higher correlation with AL (0.83
and 0.78, respectively) than with FL (≤0.70) (P-value < 0.001) (Figure 2A). Furthermore, the correlation results between AL and FL
at weeks 8–9, 11–12, and 21 were 0.69, 0.70, and 0.72,
respectively (P-value < 0.001), demonstrating
that the transcriptional differences between these two control groups
are distinct and reflected in the correlation analysis.

Figure 2 (A) Spearman’s
correlation results for hPSC, DE, hepatoblasts,
and hPSC-HEP day 25 with FL week 8–9, FL week 11–12,
FL week 21, and AL (confidence interval 95%). (B) Similarity analysis
results for hPSC-HEP day 25 to FL week 8–9, FL week 11–12,
FL week 21, and AL for FC < 1.5 between mean values of mentioned
comparisons and coefficient of variance < 30% across replicated
samples.

Next, a similarity analysis based
on gene expression levels, as
described in the methods, was performed between hPSC-HEP and the FL
and AL. In concordance with results from the correlation analysis,
these results showed that hPSC-HEP d25 have greater similarity with
AL (75%) than with FL (≤56%) (Figure 2B). Notably, the similarity of AL to the
different FL tissues was lower or equal to 63%.

Identification
of Differentially Expressed Genes during Hepatocyte
Differentiation and between hPSC-HEP and AL
To identify differentially
expressed genes between each developmental stage during the stepwise
hepatocyte differentiation and in comparison to AL, the significance
analysis of microarray (SAM) data algorithm was applied to the transitions
hPSC–DE, DE–hepatoblasts, hepatoblasts–hPSC-HEP
day 25, hPSC-HEP day 25–hPSC-HEP day 30, and hPSC-HEP day 25–AL
in the dataset E-MTAB-5567 (Figure 9). A combined threshold of false discovery rate (FDR)
< 0.05 and fold change (FC) > 3 was used to identify the significant
differential expression. The largest number (1032) of differentially
expressed genes during the hepatocyte differentiation was observed
between DE and hepatoblasts, of which 223 were downregulated in hepatoblasts.
Notably, only 11 genes were differentially expressed between hPSC-HEP
day 25 and hPSC-HEP day 30. Further, 1078 genes were differentially
expressed between hPSC-HEP day 25 and AL, of which 582 genes were
downregulated in AL (Table S1). As a first
step to analyze the differentially expressed genes, genes with exceptionally
high FC levels (FC ≥ 20) were identified and further explored.
The highest FC (272) in the comparison hPSC versus DE was shown for
the DE marker Cerberus 1 (CER1). C-X-C motif chemokine
receptor 4 (CXCR4), another important DE marker,
was also strongly upregulated. Interestingly, an unknown transcript, RP4-559A3.6, with FC of 175 was highly upregulated in the
DE cells compared to hPSC. Among the highly upregulated genes in hPSCs
compared to DE were the noncoding transcript JAKMIP2-AS1 in addition to the genes apelin receptor early endogenous ligand
(APELA), protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor Z1
(PTPRZ1), and SAM domain and HD domain 1 (SAMHD1). The top five coding transcripts with the highest
FC values that showed upregulation in hepatoblasts compared to DE
cells were the fibrinogen alpha chain (FGA), apolipoprotein
B (APOB), alpha fetoprotein (AFP), fibrinogen beta chain (FGB), and fibrinogen gamma
chain (FGG) with FC values of 265, 208, 185, 166,
and 143, respectively. Mucin 13 (MUC13) was upregulated
in hPSC-HEP day 25 compared to hepatoblasts with an FC value of 133,
in addition to leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 19 (LRRC19), lactase (LCT), annexin A13 (ANXA13), and cadherin 17 (CDH17) that also
showed FC values >55. However, these genes were downregulated in
AL.
In the comparison of hPSC-HEP day 25 versus hPSC-HEP day 30, no genes
with FC > 20 were observed (Table S2).

The genes, C-reactive protein (CRP), coagulation
factor IX (F9), complement factor H related 2 (CFHR2), complement C9 (C9), and alcohol
dehydrogenase 1B (ADH1B), were upregulated in AL,
compared to hPSC-HEP day 25, with extraordinary high FC values ranging
from 132 to 280. On the other hand, the genes LCT, AFP, CDH17, MUC13, and hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 1 (HAVCR1) were among the highly downregulated genes in AL compared to hPSC-HEP
day 25 (Table S2).

Because the liver
plays an important role in the metabolism of
xenobiotics, the expression of ADME genes in hepatocytes is of great
interest. Noteworthy, we found that 22.4% of the total ADME genes
were downregulated in hPSC-HEP compared to AL. Sixteen of the 32 core
ADME genes (http://www.pharmaadme.org) were differentially expressed between hPSC-HEP day 25 and AL, whereas
solely cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) and ABCG2, a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, were upregulated
in hPSC-HEP. In addition, the genes, solute carrier organic anion
transporter family member 1B1 (SLCO1B1), SLCO1B3, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2E1, were among the most upregulated genes in AL compared to hPSC-HEP
day 25. In the extended ADME gene list, 73 of 267 ADME genes were
differentially expressed, of which 20 genes were upregulated in hPSC-HEP
day 25 including CYP1B1, CYP2S1, CYP24A1, SLC10A2, SLC15A1, UDP glycosyltransferase 8 (UGT8), glutathione S-transferase alpha 1 (GSTA1), GSTA2, GSTA3, and flavin containing monooxygenase
(FMO1). The genes ADH1A, ADH1B, ADH1C, carboxylesterase 1 (CES1), aldehyde oxidase 1 (AOX1), and paraoxonase
1 (PON1) showed the highest upregulation in AL compared
to hPSC-HEP day 25. Surprisingly, the fetal enzyme CYP3A7 showed higher expression level in AL than in hPSC-HEP day 25 (Table S3).

Only 10 core ADME genes were
differentially expressed between hepatoblasts
and hPSC-HEP day 25. These genes, including CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2B6, were upregulated
in hPSC-HEP day 25. However, CYP2C9 and CYP2B6 were still low-expressed in hPSC-HEP day 25 compared to AL, whereas CYP3A4 did not show significant differential expression
between AL and hPSC-HEP. The genes CYP1A1 and ABCG2 were downregulated in hepatoblasts and AL compared
to hPSC-HEP day 25. In addition, 19 genes of the extended ADME list
were also differentially expressed between hepatoblasts and hPSC-HEP
day 25. The genes, serpin A7 (SERPINA7) and SLC22A3, were upregulated in both hepatoblasts and in AL
compared to hPSC-HEP day 25 (Table S4).

Venn Diagram for the Differentially Expressed Genes
The
number of overlapping differentially expressed genes at defined
developmental stages during the hepatocyte differentiation is illustrated
in a Venn diagram showing differentially expressed genes for the following
comparisons: hPSC versus DE (d0vsd5), DE versus hepatoblasts (d5vsd14),
hepatoblasts versus hPSC-HEP day 25 (d14vsd25), and hPSC-HEP day 25
versus AL (d25vsAL) (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Venn diagram showing the number of differentially expressed genes
from the following comparisons: hPSC vs DE (d0vsd5), DE vs hepatoblasts
(d5vsd14), hepatoblasts vs hPSC-HEP day 25 (d14vsd25), and hPSC-HEP
day 25 vs AL (d25vsAL).

Four transcripts were
differentially expressed between all comparisons
(region A1) including three coding transcripts, collagen type V alpha
2 chain (COL5A2), stanniocalcin 1 (STC1), and angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2),
and one noncoding transcript, long intergenic non-protein coding RNA
261 (LINC00261). Moreover, 10 transcripts were identified
as differentially expressed in all three transitions from hPSC to
hPSC-HEP day 25 (region A2). Noteworthy, APELA, dedicator
of cytokinesis 11 (DOCK11), and SAMHD1 have opposite expression profiles compared to the transcripts CYP26A1 and dual specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6) (Figure S2A,B). In addition, the transcripts
Rho GTPase activating protein 28 (RHGAP28) and follistatin
(FST) have opposite expression profiles compared
to the transcripts stomatin (STOM) and thioredoxin
interacting protein (TXNIP) (Figure S2C,D). The great majority of the genes that were differentially
expressed only in the comparisons, hepatoblasts versus hPSC-HEP day
25 and hPSC-HEP day 25 versus AL (region A11), were upregulated in
hPSC-HEP day 25 compared to both AL and hepatoblasts (Figure S3). Out of the three TFs in the region
A11, sex determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2), caudal type homeobox 2
(CDX2), and forkhead box O3 (FOXO3), only CDX2 was
upregulated in hPSC-HEP day 25 compared to both AL and hepatoblasts
with FC of 5.2 and 3.4, respectively. The differentially expressed
genes representing the different regions of the Venn diagram are listed
in Table S5.

GO Enrichment Analysis
of the Differentially Expressed Genes
In the next step, differentially
expressed genes from the comparisons,
hPSC versus DE, DE versus hepatoblasts, hepatoblasts versus hPSC-HEP
day 25, and hPSC-HEP day 25 versus AL, were analyzed using the EnrichR
software.11 Enriched gene ontology (GO)
annotation for biological process terms were retrieved, and the results
were visualized using the Revigo software (Figure 4) and are detailed in Table S6. Differentially expressed genes between hPSCs versus
DE cells were mostly enriched for terms of “endodermal cell
differentiation” and “cellular response to zinc ions,”
including “positive regulation of Wnt signaling pathway by
BMP signaling pathway” (Figure 4A). Biological process terms enriched for the differentially
expressed genes between DE and hepatoblasts were mostly associated
with “fibrinolysis” including cellular response to different
stimuli, “platelet degranulation,” and “extra
cellular matrix assembly” (Figure 4B). Annotations including “steroid
metabolism,” “bile acid secretion,” and “basement
membrane disassembly” were significantly enriched among the
differentially expressed genes between hepatoblasts and hPSC-HEP day
25 (Figure 4C). Finally,
differentially expressed genes in the comparison hPSC-HEP day 25 versus
AL were mostly enriched for terms of “regulation of complement
activation,” “bile acid metabolism,” and “bile
acid and bile acid transport” (Figure 4D).

Figure 4 GO enrichment analysis for biological processes
identified using
the EnrichR software and visualized by the Revigo software for the
following comparisons: (A) differentially expressed genes between
hPSCs and DE cells, (B) differentially expressed genes between DE
and hepatoblasts, (C) differentially expressed genes between hepatoblasts
and hPSC-HEP day 25, and (D) differentially expressed genes between
hPSC-HEP day 25 and AL.

Enriched Pathways among
the Differentially Expressed Genes
Pathway enrichment analysis
was performed on the differentially
expressed genes in each comparison. Differentiation pathways for the
different germ layers including “endoderm differentiation,”
“mesodermal commitment pathway,” and “ectoderm
differentiation” were significantly enriched for genes upregulated
in DE compared to hPSC. Differentially expressed genes between hepatoblasts
and DE cells were enriched for “cell cycle” and various
differentiation pathways in addition to many hepatocyte function pathways
such as “complement and coagulation cascades,” “metapathway
biotransformation,” and “drug induction of bile acid
pathway.” Pathways enriched for the differentially expressed
genes between hepatoblasts and hPSC-HEP day 25 included typical pathways
for mature hepatocytes such as “oxidation by cytochrome P450,”
“metapathway biotransformation,” “constitutive
androstane receptor pathway,” and “farnesoid X receptor
pathway” in addition to metabolism pathways including “tamoxifen
metabolism” and “folate metabolism.” In the comparison
hPSC-HEP day 25 versus AL, the pathways “complement activation,”
“liver X receptor pathway,” “aryl hydrocarbon
receptor pathway,” “fatty acid biosynthesis,”
and “phase I biotransformations, non P450” were enriched
(Table S7).

TF Enrichment Analysis
To further explore important
regulatory mechanisms during hepatocyte differentiation, TF binding
sites enrichment analysis was performed on differentially expressed
genes between the four comparisons hPSC versus DE, DE versus hepatoblasts,
hepatoblasts versus hPSC-HEP day 25, and hPSC-HEP day 25 versus AL
by applying the EnrichR software.11 To
explore if there was an overlap across the identified enriched TF
binding sites between the groups of differentially expressed genes,
a Venn diagram was constructed (Figure 5). As shown in Table 1, the binding sites for the TFs, androgen receptor
(AR), BTB domain and CNC homolog 1 (BACH1), FOXA1, FOXA2, FOXM1, jun
oncogene (JUN), and SOX2, were enriched in differentially expressed
genes from all four comparisons (A1 region in the Venn diagram). The
A14 region of the Venn diagram contains TFs that were differentially
expressed between hPSC-HEP day 25 versus AL, and those were CDX2,
clock circadian regulator (CLOCK), hypoxia inducible factor 1 subunit
alpha (HIF1A), and liver X receptor alpha (NR1H3). Hence, these are
of specific interest when aiming at improving hPSC-HEP.

Figure 5 Venn diagram
constructed for TFs with significantly enriched binding
sites among the differentially expressed genes in the following transitions:
hPSC–DE (d0vsd5), DE–hepatoblasts (d5vsd14), hepatoblasts–hPSC-HEP
day 25 (d14vsd25), and hPSC-HEP day 25–AL (d25vsAL). See Table 1 for a list of the
TFs.

After analyzing the enrichment of
TF binding sites (Table 1), we investigated which of
the identified TFs showed differential expression between different
developmental stages in our data (Table 2). As expected, the TFs and pluripotent markers
Nanog homeobox (NANOG) and POU class 5 homeobox 1
(POU5F1) were downregulated in the DE cells compared
to the hPSCs, whereas NANOG was further decreasing
in the transition of hepatoblasts. Another important stem cell marker,
TF SOX2, is, as expected, also strongly downregulated
in the comparison hPSC versus DE. Interestingly, the mesendodermal
marker eomesodermin (EOMES) is first strongly upregulated
in the comparison hPSC versus DE and then downregulated in the subsequent
step (DE vs hepatoblasts). Two known endodermal markers, FOXA2 and GATA binding protein 4 (GATA4), were also found
to be upregulated in DE compared to hPSCs. Moreover, Kruppel-like
factor 5 (KLF5) was upregulated in DE, compared to
hPSCs, and in hPSC-HEP day 25 compared to both hepatoblasts and AL. CDX2 was also upregulated in hPSC-HEP day 25 compared to
both hepatoblasts and AL. In addition, the TF AR was
differentially expressed in the comparison hPSC-HEP day 25 versus
AL as well (Table 2).

Assessment of the Functionality of hPSC-HEP
Because
we found a high correlation and similarity between hPSC-HEP and AL,
we performed several functional assays including measuring the activity
of cytochrome P450 enzymes, measuring albumin secretion, and urea
production in order to see if the observed correlation on the transcriptional
level could be corroborated on the functional level.

The activity
of cytochrome P450 enzymes was measured by incubating hPSC-HEP day
29 and hphep with a cocktail of substances, which are metabolized
by CYP1A, CYP2D6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP3A, and CYP2C19 enzymes. The
concentrations of the resulting metabolites were measured by liquid
chromatography/mass spectrometry. Figure 6 shows the results for the different metabolites.
For CYP1A, CYP3A, CYP2D6, and CYP2C19, the difference between their
activities in hPSC-HEP compared to hphep is not significant. However,
for CYP2C9 and CYP2B6, hphep showed significantly higher activities
than hPSC-HEP (P < 0.05 for CYP2C9 and P < 0.01 for CYP2B6). In order to confirm the protein
expression of CYP3A4, immunocytochemical stainings for CYP3A4 were
performed in hPSC-HEP (Figure 7) and indicated substantial CYP3A4 expression in a subpopulation
of hPSC-HEP, which is reminiscent of metabolic zonation found in the
liver lobe.

Figure 6 Cytochrome P450 (CYP) activities in hPSC-HEP (N = 6 cell lines) on day 29 of the differentiation and cryopreserved
human primary hepatocyte (hphep) cultured for 20 h post-thaw/plating
(N = 4 donors). The concentrations of the metabolites,
paracetamol (A; CYP1A), 3-OH-midazolam (B; CYP3A), 4-OH-diclofenac
(C; CYP2C9), 4-OH-bupropion (D; CYP2B6), 1-OH-bufuralol (E; CYP2D6),
and 4-OH-mephenytoin (F; CYP2C19), were measured by liquid chromatography/mass
spectrometry. The CYP activity is presented as pmol metabolite per
mg protein per minute (mean ± SD). Statistical significance was
determined by applying the t-test or Welch’s t-test. Y-axis is in the logarithmic scale.

Results from the albumin
secretion assay revealed comparable levels
of albumin secretion between hPSC-HEP and hphep (Figure 8A), indicating a mature hepatocyte
feature. The difference between hPSC-HEP and hphep was not significant
because of substantial interindividual variation between the hphep
donors, resulting in a high standard deviation in comparison to the
difference in the mean values between hPSC-HEP and hphep. On the other
hand, urea secretion was significantly lower in hPSC-HEP compared
to hphep (Figure 8B)
indicating that this function requires further improvement.

Discussion
Human PSC-HEP have the potential to compensate
for the shortage
and drawbacks of currently used hepatocyte models because these cells
share many features and functions with their in vivo counterparts,
and their supply is virtually unlimited. They have the potential to
serve as models for diseases such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/nonalcoholic
steatohepatitis, as viral infection models, for drug screening, and
in regenerative medicine. Although hPSC-HEP may be already good-to-go
for some areas, some functions still need to be improved, for example,
to allow the hPSC-HEP to be useful for drug metabolism and hepatotoxicity
studies as discussed below.

In the present study, we investigated
hPSC-HEP derived with an
advanced differentiation protocol that allows generating homogenous
hepatocyte cultures from a large panel of hPSC lines without the need
to adapt the protocol to individual lines.7−9 The differentiation
protocol appears to impose tight control of the differentiation process,
as demonstrated by the highly synchronized expression of lineage-specific
genes when deriving hepatocytes from multiple hPSC lines.8

In order to evaluate the maturation status
of the hPSC-HEP and
also in order to identify novel targets to improve the functionality
of hPSC-HEP, we performed extensive transcriptomics analysis on our
dataset (E-MTAB-5367), which covered the complete hepatocyte differentiation
procedure and included AL reference samples. Because our dataset did
include AL samples, but not FL samples, we merged it with a dataset
retrieved from the GEO database, which included both AL and FL. As
AL samples overlapped across the datasets, these were used to successfully
guide the batch effect reduction in the merged dataset. We applied
both correlation and similarity analyses between pairwise combinations
of all time points during hepatocyte differentiation to the FL and
AL samples. Notably, our results showed that the hPSC-HEP used in
this study have a significantly higher correlation with AL than with
FL (0.83 and 0.70, respectively), indicating an adult rather than
a fetal transcriptional phenotype of the hPSC-HEP, which is in contrast
to previous reports using other hepatocyte differentiation protocols.2,4 In line with the Spearman’s correlation results, the gene
expression in hPSC-HEP was found to be more similar to AL than to
FL (75 and 56%, respectively).

Moreover, we analyzed several
functions in order to further investigate
the maturity status of the hPSC-HEP including CYP activities, albumin
secretion, and urea production. Notably, differences of CYP1A, CYP3A,
CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 enzyme activities between hPSC-HEP and hphep were
nonsignificant, which may in part result from the high interindividual
variation in CYP activities in hphep displayed by high standard deviations
(Figure 6). Because
the activity assay does not allow the discrimination between the different
isoenzymes CYP3A4, 3A5, and 3A7, one needs additional tests to determine
the expression levels of the different isoenzymes. Noteworthy, CYP3A4
is not differentially expressed between hPSC-HEP and hphep on the
mRNA level (therefore, CYP3A4 is not listed in Table S3), which indicates an adult feature of hPSC-HEP because
the CYP3A4 expression is not present in the FL.12 CYP3A4 protein expression in hPSC-HEP was also confirmed
by immunostainings (Figure 7), and as reported previously, the CYP3A4 protein expression
is highly correlated with its enzyme activity.13 In addition, the mRNA expression of the fetal isoenzyme
CYP3A7 was lower in hPSC-HEP than in AL (Table S3), which supports the finding that hPSC-HEP appear to have
more adult-like features.

Another important hepatocyte feature,
albumin secretion, was also
detected in hPSC-HEP at levels comparable to hphep, supporting the
notion of a partially adult phenotype of the hPSC-HEP (Figure 8A). In contrast, urea secretion
in hPSC-HEP still needs to be improved (Figure 8B). Another interesting finding was that
the day 14 samples in the differentiation process (referred to as
hepatoblasts) showed higher correlation with AL than with FL (0.78
and 0.70, respectively). A potential explanation could be that the
FL harbors other cell types besides hepatoblasts, such as hematopoietic
cells, which are not present in the in vitro-derived hepatoblast population.14

Hitherto, hPSC-HEP have generally been
classified as fetal or immature
hepatocytes based on their restricted functionality and their expression
of fetal genes. However, the correlation and similarity results presented
in this study suggest that the gap between AL and hPSC-HEP has been
greatly reduced regarding hPSC-HEP derived with the differentiation
protocol used in this study. An extracellular matrix overlay and the
advanced medium composition utilized in the differentiation protocol
contribute to achieve more mature features in the hPSC-HEP compared
to previous protocols.7 The matrix overlay,
which is placed on top of the cells during the differentiation procedure,
resembles the sandwich-culture configuration in which hepatocytes
are cultured between two layers of extracellular matrix components
such as collagen. Also, other reports confirm that the use of extracellular
matrix components or the application of defined factors in the differentiation
process may help in improving the functionality of stem cell-derived
hepatocytes.3,15

Another important finding
in the present study was that only 11
genes were differentially expressed between hPSC-HEP day 25 and day
30, indicating a stable phenotype of the hPSC-HEP toward the later
stages of differentiation. This may be attributed to the matrix overlay
because this culturing technique previously has been shown to contribute
to both longevity and retention of in vivo hepatocyte features in
cultured primary hepatocytes.16

In
our previous study, we found that hPSC-HEP derived from all
six hPSC lines displayed a substantial expression of genes involved
in xenobiotic metabolism, expressed serum proteins such as albumin
and α1-antitrypsin, and were capable of glycogen storage.8 In the present study, we found that the pathways
involved in the essential hepatocyte functionality,17 such as “complement and coagulation cascades,”
“drug induction of bile acid pathway,” and “oxidation
by cytochrome P450,” in addition to biological process terms
involved in the functionality of hepatocytes,17 such as “steroid metabolism” and “bile acid
secretion,” were enriched for hPSC-HEP. However, we also observed
that 22% of the total ADME genes were downregulated in hPSC-HEP compared
to AL. In accordance with this, we found CYP2D6, CYP2B6, and CYP2C19
enzyme activities to be lower in hPSC-HEP compared to hphep (Figure 6). All together,
these results suggest a high similarity between the in vivo and in
vitro hepatocytes but also reveal functions that require further improvement
in hPSC-HEP.

Notably, the hPSC-HEP that have been investigated
in this study
mirror many functions of bona fide hepatocytes.17 Despite this significant progress compared to earlier reports,7 some functions still need to be improved. The
major differences between hPSC-HEP and AL regarding ADME genes were
the expression of the genes SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, CYP2C8, CYP2E1, CYP2C9, CYP2A6, and CYP2B6 from the core
ADME list, in addition to ADH1B, CES1, AOX1, ADH1A, ADH1C, and PON1 from the extended ADME list.17 These genes showed lower expression in hPSC-HEP
compared to AL. In our previous study, the genes CYP2E1, CYP2C9, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, and AOX1 were reported to belong to the same module
(i.e., highly connected in a protein interaction network).9 Pathway analysis revealed the association of
some of these genes with the “constitutive androstane receptor
pathway” where the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, NR1I3) is involved in regulating the transcription of CYP2C9, CYP2A6, and CYP2B6. Interestingly, both CAR and the coregulator peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor gamma, coactivator 1 alpha 2 (PPARGC1A), are downregulated in hPSC-HEP compared to AL,
which might cause the low expression of these downstream genes.18

Only four genes (STC1, LINC00261, ACE2, and COL5A2)
were differentially expressed among
all investigated groups, of which COL5A2, STC1, and ACE2 were downregulated in AL
compared to hPSC-HEP. These genes have previously been reported to
be involved in inter alia, regulation of cell differentiation, proliferation,
adhesion, liver injury, and tumorigenesis.19−21 The TF enrichment
analysis identified seven TFs (AR, BACH1, FOXA1, FOXA2, FOXM1, JUN,
and SOX2) that may regulate these genes, of which only the AR was
differentially expressed between hPSC-HEP and AL, which may account
for the observed difference. This result indicates that AR may be
an interesting candidate to target in for further protocol optimization.

Importantly, four TFs (CDX2, CLOCK, HIF1A, and NR1H3) were identified
with enriched binding sites for genes whose expression differed significantly
only between hPSC-HEP and AL. These TFs, in addition to the affected
pathways that were enriched for the differentially expressed genes
between hPSC-HEP and AL, need to be further explored to identify approaches
to adjust the gene expression in hPSC-HEP in order to reach the functionality
levels of their in vivo counterparts. One suitable strategy may be
the use of inhibitors or activators to downregulate or upregulate,
respectively, the expression of deviated genes.

Remarkably,
most of the genes that were differentially expressed
only in the comparisons, hepatoblasts versus hPSC-HEP and hPSC-HEP
versus AL, were upregulated in hPSC-HEP compared to both hepatoblasts
and AL. Notably, the TFs regulating these genes, CDX2 and KLF5, were also upregulated in hPSC-HEP compared
to both hepatoblasts and AL. These colon-associated TFs were also
identified in hepatocyte-like cells in previous reports, implying
that the cell population expresses features from different cell types2 and are targets in ongoing studies.

Interestingly,
a potential novel biomarker was also identified
for DE. The noncoding transcript RP4-559A3.6 with
an unknown function shows a high FC level during the transition from
hPSCs to DE. RP4-559A3.6 partially overlaps the left–right
determination factor 2 (LEFTY2) sequence. LEFTY2
is a nodal antagonist activated by nodal to regulate the differentiation
process toward the different germ layers.22

Conclusions
Taken together, our results demonstrated higher
correlation and
higher similarity in gene expression levels between hPSC-HEP and AL
than between hPSC-HEP and FL. Moreover, functional data confirms important
mature hepatocyte features of hPSC-HEP. Our results also showed that
a fraction of the ADME genes differed significantly between hPSC-HEP
and AL, indicating that xenobiotic metabolism requires further improvement
in hPSC-HEP. In addition, we identified abnormal gene expression and
deviations in hepatocyte pathways and TFs that may regulate these
deviations. Thus, on the transcriptome level, several putative targets
with great potential for improvement of future hepatocyte differentiation
protocols were identified. Both chemical and genetic manipulations
of these factors are promising approaches to further improve the functionality
of hPSC-HEP. A DNA methylome study is ongoing to gain new insights
into the complexity of the hPSC-HEP, which likely will help in correcting
some of the remaining deviating functions of hPSC-HEP and make their
phenotype even more similar to human adult hepatocytes.

Materials and
Methods
Microarray Datasets
Two different transcriptomics datasets
were used in this study. The differentiation analyses are based on
a transcriptomics dataset from hepatocyte differentiation of hPSCs
generated in a previous study.9 This dataset
includes global gene expression profiles from six male (XY) hPSC lines,
which were differentiated into hepatocytes by applying a prototype
of Cellartis Hepatocyte Differentiation Kit provided by Takara Bio
Europe AB (www.clontech.com) and two AL samples, as described previously.8 In short, samples from five defined differentiation stages
(hPSC, DE, hepatoblasts, hPSC-HEP day 25, and hPSC-HEP day 30) were
analyzed using the GeneChip Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 (Affymetrix).
Duplicate samples were generated in two separate differentiation experiments
from six different stem cell lines [three human embryonic stem cell
(hESC) lines and three human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)
lines; N = 2 batches per cell line]. In addition,
two AL tissue samples (N = 2 donors) from XY donors
were included as reference samples. To compare the hPSC-HEP to tissue
samples from the FL, an additional dataset containing 14 FL tissue
samples and 92 AL tissue samples was used.23 Both datasets are publicly available through the ArrayExpress database,
accession number E-MTAB-5367, and the GEO database, accession number
GSE61279.

Overview of the Bioinformatics Analyses
Extensive bioinformatics
analyses were performed to investigate the gene expression patterns
at defined developmental stages during the differentiation of hPSCs
to the hepatocyte lineage. These analyses were composed following
our developed transcriptomics data analysis framework proposed in
Ulfenborg et al.24 (Figure 9).

Merging of Two Different Microarray Datasets
To benchmark
the hPSC-HEP and define their level of maturation, they were compared
to samples from FL and AL tissues. To this end, publicly available
transcriptomics data from the GEO database (GSE61279) containing samples
from both AL and FL were used. Only human FL samples from XY donors
and human AL samples from XY aged 20–38 years with “accident”
as the cause of death were selected for this analysis to minimize
variability and collect a homogenous set of control samples. In total,
six FL tissue samples and seven AL samples were selected from this
dataset. The samples from dataset E-MTAB-5367 (excluding hPSC-HEP
day 30, constituting one data batch) were merged with the selected
samples from dataset GSE61279 (constituting the second data batch).
To reduce batch differences, batch effect correction was performed
on the merged dataset, applying the ComBat() function
from the sva package in R.10,25 There are AL samples in both datasets, and these were used as overlapping
samples to guide the batch reduction procedure. To evaluate the normalization
and reduction of batch effects in the merged dataset, the distribution
of expression values across the samples before and after the batch
effect correction was investigated using boxplots. A hierarchical
clustering analysis was also performed on the merged dataset, applying
the hclust() method from the genefilter package in R. The merged dataset with normalized values is available
in Supporting Information, Table S8.

Spearman’s Correlation Analysis
To assess the
level of maturation of the in vitro differentiated hepatocytes, the
correlation between the global transcriptional profiles of the hPSC-derived
hepatocytes and the FL and AL samples was analyzed by applying cor.test() with a confidence interval of 95% in R to calculate
the Spearman’s correlation on the mean values of the following
groups: hPSC, DE, hepatoblasts and hPSC-HEP day 25 with the mean value
of each of the following groups, FL week 8–9, FL week 11–12,
FL week 21, and AL.

Similarity in Gene Expression between Developmental
Stages in
Vitro and in Vivo
Similarity between transcriptional profiles
of the developmental stages hPSC, DE, hepatoblasts, and hPSC-HEP day
25 and FL and AL samples (FL week 8–9, FL week 11–12,
FL week 21, and AL) was assessed as described in the study by Synnergren
et al.26 where genes with an FC < 1.5
were considered as similarly expressed. To exclude transcripts with
high variability, only genes with coefficient of variance (CV) <
30% between the biological replicates were included in this analysis.
The number of transcripts that passed the above criteria was counted
as similarly expressed genes.

Identification of Differentially
Expressed Genes
To
identify genes, which show differential expression during the transitions
between the studied hepatocyte developmental stages, SAM data in the Siggenes package in R was applied on dataset E-MTAB-5367.
Pairs of samples from the in vitro hepatocyte differentiation representing
defined developmental stages were analyzed to identify differentially
expressed genes during each transition as well as between hPSC-HEP
and the reference samples (AL) (Figure 9).

Figure 9 Schematic overview of
the bioinformatic analysis performed on the
datasets E-MTAB-5367 (ArrayExpress database) and GSE61279 (GEO database).

Genes with an FDR < 0.05 and FC > 3 were
considered as significantly
differentially expressed. In addition, differentially expressed genes
with an exceptionally high FC (≥20) were also identified. Moreover,
ADME genes, including a set of core ADME genes and an extended list
of ADME genes, as categorized by PharmaADME (http://www.pharmaadme.org),
were compared to the list of differentially expressed genes between
hepatoblasts versus hPSC-HEP day 25 and hPSC-HEP day 25 versus AL
and explored in more detail.

To investigate the overlap between
the differentially expressed
genes from each transition, the Venndiagram package
in R was applied using the lists of differentially expressed genes
from the following comparisons: hPSC versus DE, DE versus hepatoblasts,
hepatoblasts versus hPSC-HEP day 25, and hPSC-HEP day 25 versus AL.
Only 11 genes, with no obvious connection to hepatocyte functionality,
were differentially expressed between hPSC-HEP day 25 and hPSC-HEP
day 30, and therefore, the samples from hPSC-HEP day 30 were excluded
from further analyses.

GO Enrichment Analysis of the Differentially
Expressed Genes
To investigate the functional properties
of the genes that show
differential expression in each transition, a GO enrichment analysis
was performed by applying the EnrichR software on dataset E-MTAB-5367.11 Biological processes with adjusted P-value < 0.05 were considered. The results from the GO enrichment
analysis were visualized by applying the Revigo software.27

Pathway Enrichment Analysis
The
differentially expressed
genes identified from each transition in dataset E-MTAB-5367 were
applied to the EnrichR software to detect significantly enriched pathways.11 Pathways with adjusted P-value
< 0.05 from the Wikipathways database were considered in this analysis.

TF Enrichment Analysis
To explore putative mechanisms
regulating the differentiation toward the hepatocyte lineage, a TF
enrichment analysis was performed on dataset E-MTAB-5367 using the
identified sets of differentially expressed genes from each transition,
hPSC–DE cells, DE–hepatoblasts, and hepatoblasts–hPSC-HEP
day 25, and from the comparison hPSC-HEP day 25–AL by applying
the EnrichR software.11 EnrichR scans the
versatile TF databases to determine if the submitted gene list includes
genes with binding sites for known TF. The software returns the TF
whose target sites are enriched in the group of input genes, including
a significance measure. Results from the TF interaction database ChIP
Enrichment Analysis (ChEA_2016) with adjusted P-value
< 0.05 were considered. A Venn diagram analysis was applied on
the set of TF identified with enriched binding sites for the differentially
expressed genes to reveal overlap between different transitions. The
identified TFs in each transition were compared to the lists of the
differentially expressed genes to determine if they are differentially
expressed in our dataset and thus, a putative regulator of the transition.

Immunocytochemistry
hPSC-HEP were stained on day 29
for CYP3A4 as described previously.8 The
antibodies, anti-human CYP3A4 Rabbit-IgG (cat. no. PAP011, Cypex)
and Donkey anti-rabbit-IgG-Alexa 488 (cat. no. A-21206, Thermo Fisher
Scientific), were diluted 1:200 and 1:1000, respectively.

Activity Assay
for CYP Enzymes
The activities of the
enzymes CYP1A, CYP3A, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 were measured in
hPSC-HEP derived from the six hPSC-lines (on day 29 after start of
differentiation) and in cryoplateable human primary hepatocytes from
four different donors (BioIVT, Frankfurt am Main, Germany), as described
previously.7,8 Briefly, the cells were incubated for 2
h with a cocktail of CYP substrates, 10 μM phenacetin, 10 μM
bufuralol, 10 μM diclofenac, 10 μM bupropion, 50 μM
mephenytoin, and 5 μM midazolam, metabolized by CYP1A, CYP2D6,
CYP2C9, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, respectively. The human primary
hepatocytes were plated and cultured for 20 h in total post-thaw,
including the CYP activity assay. The concentrations of the produced
metabolites (paracetamol, 1-OH-bufuralol, 4-OH-diclofenac, 4-OH-bupropion,
4-OH-mephenytoin, and 3-OH-midazolam) were measured by liquid chromatography/mass
spectrometry performed at Pharmacelsus GmbH (Saarbrücken, Germany).

Detection of Albumin Secretion
Albumin secretion was
measured in duplicate using the Albuwell ELISA kit (Cat. no. 1004,
Exocell) according to the instruction of the manufacturer. Samples
were collected from hPSC-HEP derived from ChiPSC6b and ChiPSC18 (on
day 29 after start of differentiation) after 24 h of incubation in
their standard maintenance medium Cellartis hepatocyte maintenance
medium (cat. no. Y30051; Takara Bio Europe AB). Cryoplateable human
primary hepatocytes from three different donors were plated and incubated
for 24 h in InvitroGro CP medium (BioIVT). Twenty fours post-thaw,
the medium was changed to Cellartis power primary hepatocyte medium
(cat. no. Y20020, Takara Bio Europe AB), and samples were collected
24 h later. Results were calculated from the log–log regression
obtained by the fit of the standard curve and normalized to protein
content and are presented in μg albumin/mg protein.

Urea Determination
by Colorimetric Quantification
The
determination of urea was assayed using the QuantiChrom UREA Assay
Kit (cat. no. DIUR-500, Bioassay Systems) according to the recommendation
of the manufacturer with minor modifications.

Samples were collected
from hPSC-HEP derived from ChiPSC6b and ChiPSC18 (on day 29 after
start of differentiation) after 24 h of incubation in their standard
maintenance medium Cellartis hepatocyte maintenance medium (cat. no.
Y30051; Takara Bio Europe AB) supplemented with 5 mM ammonium chloride
and with a control group incubated in a medium without ammonium chloride.
Cryoplateable human primary hepatocytes from three different donors
were plated and incubated for 24 h in InvitroGro CP medium (BioIVT).
Twenty four hours post-thaw, the medium was changed to Cellartis power
primary hepatocyte medium (cat. no. Y20020, Takara Bio Europe AB)
supplemented with 5 mM ammonium chloride (a control group was incubated
in a medium without ammonium chloride), and samples were collected
24 h later. A standard curve was constructed with the following concentrations
of urea: 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.625, 0.312, 0.156, and 0.078 mg. Equal volumes
of reagent A and reagent B were prepared, and 200 μL was added
to each sample. The samples were incubated for 50 min at room temperature.
After incubation, the absorbance of all samples was read at 430 nm.
Raw data was blank-corrected using the absorbance of the control samples.
The results were calculated from the linear regression obtained by
the fit of the standard curve and normalized to protein content and
are presented in mg urea/mg protein.

Statistical Analysis
To determine if there is a significant
statistical difference between the compared groups, we applied t-test for groups with equal variances or groups that had
different variances, but the group with the largest variance included
fewer samples.28 Otherwise we applied the
Welch’s t-test to ensure the highest statistical
power. As demonstrated previously, t-test is feasible
with an extremely small sample size (N ≤ 5).28
