==== Body
We have identified an error
in our calculation of the density of the DNA brush, which we reported
in our paper as 1200 chains/μm2 (p 2209, Results
and Discussion, first paragraph). This error was due to the use of
an incorrect calibration curve in our derivation of the DNA brush
density. Additional experiments indicated that the correct DNA brush
density was 16 000 chains/μm2. Along with
the correction, the average interchain distance of the DNA brush should
be revised from 31 to 8.5 nm. The number ratios of GNRs to DNA chains
should also be revised from 0.25, 0.83, and 2.1 to 0.019, 0.063, and
0.16, respectively (p 2210). Although the revised value of the DNA
brush density is about 13 times more than was originally reported,
these corrections do not affect any of the results, related discussion,
or conclusions drawn from this work. We apologize for any inconvenience.
