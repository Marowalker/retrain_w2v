==== Body
It has been
just over two and
a half years since the journal was launched in 2016,1,2 and ACS Omega is firmly establishing itself as
one of the choicest venues for Open Access publishing in the chemical
sciences and interfacing areas. While we anticipated growth in all
key metrics for the journal, the year 2018 truly surpassed all our
expectations. Notably, in 2018, ACS Omega increased
published output to 2044, a growth of over 100% compared to 2017 (1008
publications), with a truly global representation of authorship (Figure 1a). This number includes
fifteen Perspectives on diverse topics from several prominent authors.
We thank each one of the authors who submitted articles to our journal
and trust they had a good publishing experience with ACS Omega. The article downloads of our published content approached nearly
1.5 million in 2018 (Figure 1b), reflecting the growing use, appeal, trust in quality,
and accessibility of our journal. Importantly the usage profile is
made up of an approximately 50%–50% split between ACS institutional
subscribers and non-subscribers, emphasizing the value of publishing
in our Open Access journal to genuinely reach new audiences.

Figure 1 (a) The broad
geographic distribution of published articles by
region in 2018 is shown based upon the country of the corresponding
author. (b) The annual usage of published content in ACS Omega since journal inception is shown.

Several
published articles were selected as ACS Editors’
Choice (https://pubs.acs.org/editorschoice/) in 2018 or featured extensively on social media and news outlets.
We have showcased a selection of some of these articles that reflect
the quality (Table 1) and public appeal (Table 2) of content published in ACS Omega in 2018.

We would like
to thank the many editors from our sister journals
at ACS Publications who have chosen ACS Omega to
publish their work. It is notable that, to date, a total of 35 ACS
Editors from 22 different journals have collectively published 54
research papers in our journal. These include articles from Editors-in-Chief:
Kirk Schanze (ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces) DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.6b00189, Marc Hillmyer (Macromolecules) DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.6b00284, David Kaplan (ACS Biomaterials
Science & Engineering) DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.6b00320 and DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.8b01451, Cynthia Burrows (Accounts
of Chemical Research) DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.8b01551, Françoise Winnik (Langmuir) DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.8b02311, Jonathan Sweedler (Analytical Chemistry) DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.8b01713, and Vincent Rotello (Bioconjugate Chemistry) DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.8b02438. It is also pleasing to note that Jürgen Bajorath, an Associate
Editor of the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry and
winner of the prestigious “ACS Award for Computers in Chemical
& Pharmaceutical Research” in 2018, holds the honor as
the most published author in ACS Omega since launch
with a total of 14 papers.

While published content from ACS Omega was already
listed and indexed in all major databases between 2016 and 2017 (e.g.,
SciFinder, Scopus, PubMed Central, Google Scholar, DOAJ, etc.), the
year 2018 saw the journal formally move from Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science Emerging Sources Citation Index to the main Science Citation Index Expanded database. This elevation
represents another measure of trust and quality in scholarly publishing
but is also an indication that the journal will receive its inaugural
partial impact factor in the summer of 2019.

Our editorial board
saw significant changes in 2018. We substantially
expanded our editorial board to allow us to handle the ever-increasing
volume of manuscripts received (both de novo as well as transferred)
and topical diversity. During 2018, seven eminent scientists from
across the globe joined the ACS Omega team as Associate
Editors. These include Jesús Jiménez-Barbero (CIC bioGUNE,
Spain), Sensuke Ogoshi (Osaka University, Japan), Eriko Takano (University
of Manchester, UK), Luisa Torsi (Università di Bari “Aldo
Moro”, Italy), Jing-Lin Zuo (Nanjing University, China), Johan
Hofkens (Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium), and Shaojun Guo
(Peking University, China), each with broad and complementary subject
expertise. Swagata Dasgupta (IIT Kharagpur, India) will join the editorial
team in January 2019, and more Associate Editors will be enlisted
in the first quarter of 2019. Likewise, the Editorial Advisory Board
of the journal has been expanded to 62 from 18 countries, with 26
new members added in 2018. Finally, three Associate Editors from sister
ACS Journals have been actively serving ACS Omega as Advising Editors. We welcome all of our new Associate Editors,
Advising Editors, and Editorial Advisory Board members. The end of
2018 also saw two of our inaugural Co-Editors Cornelia Bohne and Luis
Liz-Marzán bidding the team farewell, in addition to Senior
Managing Editor, Dr. Miranda Paley. We would like to take this opportunity
to thank them for their immense contributions and tireless service
in making ACS Omega the success it is today.

A look back at 2018 cannot be complete without acknowledging the
vital contributions of our ever-increasing community of voluntary
reviewers. In 2018, 5976 unique reviewers from 83 countries worldwide
aided us with their analyses of manuscripts submitted to ACS
Omega, an increase in number of almost 80% compared with
2017.3 We sincerely thank each reviewer
(Supporting Information Table S1) for their
care and diligence in aiding us with our decision making and for the
role they have played in maintaining the quality of ACS Omega. Due to the timeliness of returned reviews, we have still been able
to maintain fast processing times despite the substantial increase
in submissions over the past year. Our average time to first decision
remains at a highly competitive 25 days.

Over the past year,
the team of Co-Editors, Associate Editors,
and Managing Editors continued to strive to engage with our community
of scientists around the world by seeking feedback, hearing questions
and concerns and contributing to the chemistry enterprise. ACS Omega supported and sponsored up to 34 conferences,
symposia, and meetings in 2018 including a number of oral and poster
prizes to young scientists (Figure 2).

Figure 2 (a) Prof. Krishna Ganesh presenting poster prizes sponsored
by ACS Omega at the 8th Peptide Engineering
Meeting
(PEM8-2018), November 8–10, 2018, Berlin, Germany. (b) Prof.
Deqing Zhang speaking at the 11th National Symposium on
Electronic Process in Organic Solids organized by the Chinese Chemical
Society, October 26–29, 2018, Qingdao, China, where ACS Omega served as a sponsor of the poster prizes.

Looking to the future in 2019, ACS Omega will
endeavor to continue to increase its global footprint as well as widen
its topical diversity. We are working on editorial strategies and
workflows to continue to handle the growing number of submissions,
maintaining and even shortening the turnaround time for submitted
manuscripts by accelerating decision-making processes. The inclusion
of new manuscript types (apart from the existing full-length Research
articles and Perspectives) is also in the cards in 2019—for
example, the introduction of Minireviews that focus on succinct accounts
of rapidly emerging areas, techniques, or processes, in cross-disciplinary
research domains. Efforts will also be made to reach out and actively
inform the chemistry community of ACS Omega’s
published content by providing specially customized highlights. As
editors of ACS Omega, we believe that our Open Access
journal is best served by being author-friendly, without compromising
the quality of published manuscripts, a hallmark of all ACS journals.
In closing, we would once again like to thank all our authors and
reviewers and look forward to continuing our collaboration into 2019.
