Magnetic ferrites
are used in a wide range of technological applications, such as biomedicine,
electronics, or energy. They also present interesting magnetic properties,
especially for high-frequency applications. These materials have been
prepared by a large variety of methods, from basic solid-state reaction
to advanced wet chemical methods. However, most of these approaches
are complex and have low production rates. In this work, a deep analysis
of an easy polymer-assisted sol–gel synthesis of copper ferrite
(CuFe2O4) nanoparticles is done. A multivariate
analysis, by means of the design of experiments approach, is carried
out to account for two variables at a time. Moreover, a wide experimental
domain is explored, and the impact of each variable on the chemical
composition and magnetic properties is determined. This work results
in an optimization of the synthesis method to obtain high-purity nanoparticles
(∼96%).

Introduction
Magnetic materials
are a family of materials widely used in technological applications.
The changes in properties that they experiment when their size is
reduced to the nanometric scale make them even more interesting than
those in the bulk form. They have been claimed as promising candidates
for medical diagnostics1 and treatment,2−4 sensors,5 improving the efficiency and
opening new opportunities in the energy sector,6,7 and
data storage8,9 for instance.

Spinel ferrites
have a structure with the form MFe2O4, where
M is a divalent cation and typically a transition metal. Oxygen (O2–) ions form a face-centered cubic structure, Fe3+ cations occupy half of the octahedral holes (hO), and M2+ ions are placed in eight of the tetrahedral
holes (hT). In particular, copper ferrite (CuFe2O4) has an inverse spinel structure, which has a different
occupation of the vacancies: M2+ cations are placed in
hO with half of the Fe3+ ions, whereas the other
half are in hT.

These types of materials have been
previously prepared by a wide range of wet synthesis methods, such
as co-precipitation,10−12 thermal decomposition,13,14 sonochemichal,15−18 or solvothermal.19,20 Most of these methods ensure
good results in terms of low particle size and morphology control,
but, on the other hand, it is usually complex to have a precise control
over the process, and the production rate is low. On the other hand,
high-temperature solid-state methods are simple and easy to scale
up. However, the degree of control that they have over the properties
of the final material is poor. In this scenario, the sol–gel
and gel combustion technique21−26 appears as a promising option due to its simplicity and control
over the product characteristics. For this reason, different researchers
have recently used this method in their work. For instance, López-Ramón
et al.22 and Zhuravlev et al.23 showed the formation of both phases, tetragonal
and cubic, depending on the synthesis conditions. The report from
Masunga et al.27 is a good summary of the
work previously done in this field.

Although there is an extensive
list of interesting publications regarding the sol–gel preparation
of CuFe2O4, there is a lack of a deep analysis
of the process under a wide range of conditions. Previous papers tend
to work under specific conditions, or only one variable is modified
when its effect is explored. In this work, we provide a multivariable
analysis, by means of the design of experiments (DoE) approach,28 to numerically quantify the effect of the calcination
time and temperature. Thus, our work explores two variables at a time
and accounts for their possible interaction. Moreover, two analysis
cycles are performed to explore a wider experimental domain. The effect
that each variable has on the chemical composition and magnetic properties
is determined. This work leads to an optimization of the polymer-assisted
sol–gel synthesis29 of CuFe2O4 nanoparticles to maximize the product purity.

Results
and Discussion
Based on the obtained results from preliminary
experiments, the conditions chosen for the first DoE are presented
in Table 1. The temperature
limits have been set to 750 and 950 °C, whereas the time varies
from 15 min to 2 h.

This first batch of samples has been characterized
by X-ray diffraction (XRD) to determine their crystal structure and
chemical composition. Figure 1 shows a general comparison of the four obtained patterns.

Figure 1 XRD patterns
of the four samples prepared in the first batch of experiments. All
of the patterns have been spaced 400 units to facilitate their visualization
and comparison. The different markers indicate the 2θ positions
of the main peaks of the three phases.

By analyzing these results, it is possible to corroborate that the
desired CuFe2O4 phase is predominant in all
of the experiments. It has a tetragonal structure with cell parameters
of a = b = 5.8444 Å and c = 8.6340 Å. Moreover, smaller quantities of rhombohedral
Fe2O3 and monoclinic CuO are also detected.
The presence of these structures is in good agreement with the obtained
results under similar conditions by other authors.22 The characteristic CuFe2O4 peak at
around 18° is present in all of the samples, but it seems clear
that the peak at 24°, which corresponds to Fe2O3, disappears as the thermal treatment becomes more intense
(larger times and higher temperatures). Therefore, it is seen that
higher temperatures and longer times favor the ferrite formation,
as could be expected. Considering that the relative peak intensity
is directly proportional to the presence of each phase, and that all
of the samples have been consecutively measured in the same device
and under the same conditions, it is possible to make a first approximation
to determine their relative purity. Figure 2 zooms different peaks from Figure 1 to make a clearer comparison.

Figure 2 Zoomed
peaks of the first batch of samples. (A) and (B) are CuFe2O4 peaks, (C) is a Fe2O3 peak, and
(D) is a CuO peak.

In Figure 2A,B, the presence of CuFe2O4 is evident as the temperature and time increase. Samples
are perfectly ordered according to their calcination conditions: in
both cases, sample #1 (15 min at 750 °C) is the one with a lower
intensity (around 30% less than the higher peak), whereas sample #4
(120 min at 950 °C) shows the maximum intensity. Meanwhile, samples
#2 and #3 present intermediate behaviors. Nevertheless, the relative
intensity of the sample at 950 °C is higher than that of the
one at 750 °C even though the calcination time is longer in the
second case. This means that, in this range, temperature seems to
have a major impact on the chemical composition than time, i.e., high-purity
products can be obtained in fast reactions at high temperatures. According
to the conclusions obtained by Khemthong et al.,30 CuFe2O4 is mainly formed during the
gel combustion, whereas the later calcination processes determine
the crystallinity and phase purity. The observed tendency perfectly
supports what is expected from a thermodynamic point of view: the
chemical reaction between CuO and Fe2O3 is favored
for higher-energy inputs.

Even though this first analysis seems
to clearly show that the phases are formed, all of the samples have
been analyzed by the Rietveld refinement31 to extract quantitative information about their chemical composition.
In Figure 3, the result
of the refinement for one of the samples is shown.

Figure 3 Rietveld refinement of
sample #1 from the first batch of samples. Measured data is represented
by circles, whereas the continuous red line shows the calculated model.
The difference between both values is represented in the bottom plot.

As can be observed, the relative intensity between
peaks of the same phase is not accurate. This might be due to the
presence of a preferred crystallographic orientation (which is unexpected
in powder samples) or because the considered structural model for
the calculation is not fully strict with the reality. Nevertheless,
as the scale factor, peak shape, and unit cell parameters are correctly
adjusted, the results are rigorous with the purity of each sample.
The average crystallite size, determined by the Scherrer formula,
is 13.46 nm, confirming thus the nanometric structure of the material.
A resume of the obtained compositions is presented in Table 2.

a χ2 represents the quality of the adjustment.

Again, the formation of CuFe2O4 and the consumption of CuO and Fe2O3 at high temperatures and long times are confirmed,
as could be expected from a thermodynamic point of view.

Once
the percentage of CuFe2O4 is obtained from each
experiment, it is possible to calculate the values of all of the parameters
in eq 1. The obtained
values are b0 = 86.2, b1 = 3.3, b2 = 9.5, and b12 = −3.2. Then, we have predicted the
purity (Y) at any point in the area between the tested
experimental points. Figure 4 graphically represents the obtained coefficients, as well
as the calculated Y values in all of the experimental
domain.

Figure 4 (A) Obtained parameters for b1, b2, and b12; (B)
first DoE-calculated purity values.

By analyzing the coefficients, it is possible to extract two main
conclusions: (i) the calcination temperature (b2) has approximately three times the impact on the chemical
composition than the time (b1), as it
was predicted by analyzing the XRD pattern in Figure 2; (ii) the magnitude of the interaction variable
(b12) is on the order of magnitude of b1, so, apart from the individual effects, there
is a considerable interaction between both variables.

To study
the effect that these variables have on the particle size, Figure 5 shows the number
and volume particle size distributions for each sample.

Figure 5 Particle size
distribution of the first batch of samples represented as a function
of (A) number of particles and (B) volume fraction.

In all samples, most of the particles are in the nanometric
range because the number distribution is centered under 100 nm. On
the other hand, the major part of the volume of the sample is occupied
by micrometer-sized particles. This double effect can be due to two
different factors: (i) most of the particles are nanometric in size,
but there are others (much lower in number) that are orders of magnitude
bigger and have a greater influence when representing the volume fraction
(it would happen in a synthesis process with an extremely low degree
of control); (ii) nanoparticles have been formed, but then they get
attached to each other by thermal processes (i.e., sintering) forming
micrometric clusters. The shape of the volume distribution suggests
that different distributions coexist in the sample. Therefore, the
formation of clusters may be the origin of these micrometric bodies.
Otherwise, a more continuous distribution should be expected if micrometric
particles would have been formed. Moreover, as LD principles assume
spherical particles, the different superposed peaks could also be
originated by irregular-shaped particles, which is common in aggregates.

The physical aspect of particles has been checked by SEM to have
a clear idea about their morphology. Figure 6 shows some of the images of these samples.

Figure 6 SEM images
at ×3000 magnification of all of the powder samples from the
first batch: (A) sample #1, (B) sample #2, (C) sample #3, and (D)
sample #4.

In the four cases, it can be seen
how micrometric clusters are formed by the agglomeration of submicrometric
particles. These results verify the arguments presented from the LD
results. Also, the size distribution of aggregates is wide and the
shape is irregular in all samples, in good agreement with the volume
LD results.

Now, it is clear that small particles have been
synthesized, but due to the calcination effect, they behave as building
blocks that sinter each other, forming bigger agglomerates. The size
of the individual small particles is difficult to be determined with
these images, but it is clear that their size is below 1 μm.
Furthermore, by looking below the big aggregates, it is possible to
find a distribution of particles that are smaller in size than those
particles forming the agglomerates. This smaller distribution, which
is considerably below 1 μm in diameter, may be a representative
of those nanometric particles that have not sintered with others,
keeping in this way their original size. Even though the shape of
the aggregates is irregular, individual nanoparticles seem to be spherical
shaped.

All of these results are in good agreement with those
from the LD particle size analysis and have been already observed
in above-mentioned works.13,15,22,23 Therefore, number percentage
distributions can be understood as a representation of the size of
the formed particles, whereas the volume percentage distribution gives
information about the sintering process between the previously formed
nanoparticles.

Once the real meaning of each representation
has been discussed, it is time to come back to Figure 5. In the number percentage representation,
there is almost no difference between the size distribution of the
nanoparticles prepared at different conditions. The resolution of
the measurement is bigger than the difference produced for the different
conditions. The mean value of these distributions is 93.3 ± 0.7
nm. This result, together with the previous Scherrer calculation,
suggests the formation of a polycrystalline microstructure, as the
mean particle size is greater than the mean crystallite size. On the
other hand, by studying the volume percentage distributions, it is
clear how the distribution is progressively shifted to bigger diameters
as the calcination intensifies. Even though it consists of the superposition
of different peaks, the main distribution has a clear dependence on
the thermal treatment. Consequently, the effect that the thermal treatment
has on sintering between particles is demonstrated.

Overall,
the inverse effect that these conditions have on the final goal of
this work can be seen: when the calcination is more intense, purity
and sintering between particles increase; for soft calcinations, the
sintering is lower and the product is less pure. Thus, an optimum
balance between both variables needs to be found to have high-purity
products and, at the same time, reduce as much as possible the sintering
between nanoparticles.

Finally, the magnetic hysteresis cycle
[M(H)] of these samples has been measured. As can be observed in Figure 7, only the first
magnetization curve and the demagnetization from the positive to the
negative saturations have been measured. As the hysteresis cycle has
a symmetric behavior when the magnetic field is reversed, these conditions
are sufficient for measuring the properties under study in this work.

Figure 7 SQUID
M(H) measurements for the first batch of samples. The inner plot is
a zoomed representation of the data close to the origin of coordinates.

These results clearly show how the saturation magnetization
(MS), i.e., the maximum magnetization
that can be achieved by the material, increases as the thermal treatment
becomes stronger. Also, by examining the inner plot, it is seen how
the magnetic permeability (μ, which corresponds to the slope
of the first magnetization curve) is also dependent on the thermal
treatment. For both commented magnetic properties, when the sample
is prepared at 750 °C, there is a strong dependence on the treatment
time, whereas it is weaker or inexistent when the sample is prepared
at 950 °C. Additionally, the remanent magnetization (MR) and the coercive field (HC) have the same increasing tendency at stronger calcination
conditions, except in the case of sample #1. All of the quantitative
results are summarized in Table 3. The tendency in all cases follows the compositional
results determined by XRD, having higher MS, MR, HC,
and μ than those samples with a higher CuFe2O4 content.

3	31.9	12.6	365.8

Once the first conditions were tested,
this work focused its attention on a more detailed study of a smaller
region around the optimum (previously represented in Figure 4B). By considering that there
are no significant differences in the size of the formed nanoparticles,
the region where higher purities have been achieved is zoomed. The
new conditions are described inTable 4. XRD results of this second batch of samples are shown
in Figure 8.

Figure 8 XRD patterns
of the four samples prepared in the second batch of experiments. All
of the patterns have been spaced 400 units to facilitate their visualization
and comparison. The different markers indicate the 2θ positions
of the main peaks of the three phases.

All of the analyzed samples
have the same predominant crystalline CuFe2O4 phase found in the first batch, with smaller traces of CuO and Fe2O3. It is worth noticing that the characteristic
peaks of these undesired phases have been considerably reduced and
are difficult to be detected with this view. Again, to make a better
comparison between the different synthesis conditions, some peaks
are zoomed and shown in Figure 9. The selected peaks are the same as those in Figure 1.

Figure 9 Zoomed peaks of the second
batch of samples. (A) and (B) are CuFe2O4 peaks,
(C) is a Fe2O3 peak, and (D) is a CuO peak.

In Figure 9A,B, two CuFe2O4 peaks are represented.
It can be seen that, despite the case of sample #1, all of the samples
are close to the maximum value. In addition, sample #2 is slightly
less intense, and those samples prepared at 950 °C reach the
same values independently of the calcination time. Figure 9C,D represents impurity peaks.
The first, corresponding to a characteristic Fe2O3 peak, is actually inexistent for the four samples, giving thus a
good idea about the purity improvement in this batch. Finally, the
last image indicates that all samples still have some CuO traces,
which are almost the same in all of them. To have more detailed information,
all samples have been refined by the Rietveld method. Figure 10 shows the profile fitting
done for one of the samples, and Table 5 contains the refined values.

of sample #4 from the second batch of samples. Measured data is represented
by circles, whereas the continuous red line shows the calculated model.
The difference between both values is represented in the bottom plot.

a χ2 represents the quality of the adjustment.

The Rietveld refinement confirms what was suggested
before: the purity is excellent in all of the samples and all of the
values are extremely similar. The small diversity is not significant
and is influenced by the small differences in the profile fitting
quality. The mean purity value is 95.8 ± 0.2%. This similarity
in the results suggests that in these conditions a maximum purity
is reached.

When these experimental responses are used to deduce
the model described in eq 1, the parameters obtained are b0 = 95.8, b1 = 0.1, b2 = −0.1,
and b12 = 0.0. The graphical representation
of these values and the predicted purity are represented in Figure 11.

Figure 11 (A) Obtained parameters
for b1, b2, and b12; (B) second DoE-calculated
purity values.

In this second design of samples,
the obtained coefficients are substantially lower than those obtained
in the first design. In contrast with the first batch, now the relative
value of b12 is much lower than b1 and b2. These
results are consistent with the fact that the chemical composition
is almost constant in this range. Moreover, the surface represented
in Figure 11B is almost
constant in all of the experimental domain. Even though it may seem
that there is some slope, the corresponding small purity should be
taken into account. Finally, to check the model results obtained here,
an extra sample with intermediate conditions has been prepared and
characterized. This sample has been prepared at 900 °C for 60
min, and the corresponding purity obtained by the Rietveld refinement
is 95.7% with χ2 = 3.08. This chemical composition
is consistent with the predicted values under the same conditions
(95.8%), and, hence, the model is validated.

These stable composition
values are similar to those obtained in other works, which synthesize
CuFe2O4 nanoparticles by similar methods.22,23,32 Even though the maximum reported
purities in these works (95%) are slightly lower than ours, it is
worth mentioning that these studies used maximum calcination temperatures
of 800 °C, whereas our second batch is prepared at a calcination
temperature of 850 °C. As it has been clearly demonstrated in
this study, this difference in temperature can lead to an increase
of ferrite conversion. On the other hand, all works agree on the formation
of the tetragonal phase of CuFe2O4 in the studied
temperature range.

This second batch of samples has also been
analyzed by LD to study their particle size distribution. Results
are shown in Figure 12.

Figure 12 Particle size distribution of the second batch of samples represented
as a (A) function of the number of particles and (B) as the percentage
of volume that each diameter represents in the hole sample.

Again, all samples have their number percentage
distribution centered under 100 nm, certifying their nanometric nature.
No clear differences are detected between samples, which have a mean
value of 93.1 ± 1.4 nm. These results are on the same order as
those obtained for the first batch. Regarding the volume percentage
distribution, a curious behavior is seen: those samples calcinated
at lower temperatures (#1, #2) are displaced to bigger sizes. On the
other hand, the aspect of patterns suggests that the distributions
are more homogeneous when the sample is processed at lower temperatures,
which corresponds to a lower degree of particle sintering and agglomeration.

The behavior seen in Figure 13 is similar to the one previously discussed in Figure 6: spherical-shaped
nanometric particles sinter by thermal processes, forming micrometric
clusters. Nanoparticles have been clearly formed, but the applied
thermal energy produces this sintering effect between particles. Therefore,
an equilibrium needs to be found to maximize the ferrite purity and
to avoid sintering. Once the maximum purity is reached, as happens
in this second batch, it is recommended to work at the lower possible
temperature and time to reduce the agglomeration.

Figure 13 SEM images at ×3000
magnifications of all of the powder samples of the second batch: (A)
sample #1, (B) sample #2, (C) sample #3, and (D) sample #4.

These final samples have also been analyzed by
SQUID magnetometry. The hysteresis cycle results are shown in Figure 14.

Figure 14 SQUID M(H) measurements
for the second batch of samples. The inner plot is a zoomed representation
of the data close to the origin of coordinates.

As could be expected from the chemical and crystallographic results,
here, the magnetic behavior is much more similar between samples than
in the first batch. Nevertheless, there is still a small difference
in MS and μ between those samples
prepared at 850 and 950 °C, where they are higher when the calcination
is more intense. Although the differences are now smaller, it is possible
to see how those samples prepared at higher temperatures have smaller
values of MR and HC. It is contrary to what has been obtained for the first batch
of samples. Nevertheless, it should be considered that the differences
in these cases are much smaller and they may be in the error range
of the measurement. Finally, the main parameters obtained from these
measurements are shown in Table 6.

Table 6 Magnetic Properties of the Second
Batch of Samples
sample (#)	MS (emu/g)	MR (emu/g)	|HC| (Oe)	
1	29.3	14.0	623.6	
2	30.6	13.9	453.4	
3	31.7	13.0	437.1	
4	31.4	12.7	400.3	
The obtained MS values are greater than those previously reported for CuFe2O4 nanoparticles prepared by similar methods,22,32,33 which show values between 20
and 28 emu/g. In samples treated at 800 °C, López-Ramón
et al. reported much softer magnetic properties, with approximately MR values of 0.8 emu/g and HC of 30 Oe. Anandan et al. obtained similar remanence
and coercivity values (MR of 12 emu/g
and HC of 631 Oe), whereas Sumangala et
al. results show a harder behavior (HC of around 1 kOe). The paper published by Yadav et al.34 reports values of MS = 25 emu/g, MR = 8, and HC = 218 Oe when the tetragonal phase is completely formed.
These results are on the same order of magnitude as ours but with
a softer behavior.

Table 7 provides an overall comparison of our results with those
previously reported by other authors. The sample prepared at 850 °C
has been used for the comparison because its conditions are similar
to those in other studies and it may be considered to represent the
optimal conditions found in the second DoE. Only studies with the
same crystal structure have been considered for a more rigorous comparison.

It is appreciable that both the purity and MS values reported in our work are greater than
the values of all of these papers using similar synthesis methods
and forming the tetragonal crystal structure. The elevated MS level achieved in this work may be a consequence
of the high sample purity, according to the tendencies observed in
the first DoE. Moreover, it is possible to see that we are even obtaining
better results than other works carrying out the calcination at higher
temperatures. Furthermore, our calcination process is clearly faster
than the others, confirming the low impact of the time on the obtained
properties. Therefore, the hypothesis stating that short calcinations
at high temperatures are probably the best option is reinforced.

The dependence of MS and MR on the CuFe2O4 content is shown
in Figure 15. All
of the samples from both batches have been represented. As can be
clearly seen, both magnitudes increase with the CuFe2O4 content. For high-purity samples, the values are almost constant,
which can be assumed as those corresponding to the pure CuFe2O4. Overall, the formation of the complex ferrite from
its former oxides increases the saturation magnetization, although
it is accompanied by a slight increase of the remanence.

Conclusions
In this work, copper
ferrite nanoparticles have been successfully synthesized by means
of a simple polymer-assisted sol–gel method. The process and
the conditions have been described, and the process has been studied
in a wide range of conditions. A multivariate analysis, by means of
the design of experiments approach, has allowed us to do a multivariable
analysis of the effect of the calcination time and temperature on
the nanoparticle properties. Furthermore, it has been proved a higher
agglomeration of particles for stronger calcinations.

The first
DoE planned in a wide range of conditions has been useful to confirm
that the ferrite conversion improves for calcinations at high temperatures
and long times. Moreover, temperature has been observed to have a
stronger impact on the final properties than time. The second DoE
has shown a plateau on chemical composition and magnetic properties
above 850 °C. Therefore, the optimum conditions have been set
to calcination at 850 °C for 30 min.

The results obtained
in this work are an improvement over those previously published by
other authors in similar conditions. The sample purity (96%), as well
as the saturation magnetization (31 emu/g), is slightly higher than
that found by other authors. However, we have not been able to obtain
perfectly isolated nanoparticles, as they sinter during calcination.
Moreover, the number distribution of the nanoparticles could not be
obtained in detail for each sample due to resolution limitations.

Future work should be addressed to the reduction of particle sintering
and thus obtain isolated nanoparticles. To do so, the temperature
range between 750 and 850 °C could be explored in more detail.
Lower temperatures should, in principle, lead to lower sintering between
particles.

Experimental Section
Materials
The metal salt precursors
used for the synthesis of CuFe2O4 were iron
nitrate [Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, Labkem]
and copper nitrate [Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, Labkem], with poly(vinylpyrrolidone), PVP [(C6H9NO)n, Sigma-Aldrich], as a gelling
agent. Distilled water was used as the solvent.

Design of Experiments,
DoE
The DoE approach is a powerful method used to optimize
processes and quantitatively estimate the effect that different variables
have in a process and their possible interactions. For this work,
a Full Factorial Design (2K) strategy
was selected and two variables (K = 2) were analyzed:
calcination temperature (X1, in degrees)
and time (X2, in min). The evaluated response
(Y, in percentage) was the purity of the obtained
ferrite.

The upper and lower levels were defined in each of
the two optimization cycles that were done in this work. Once the
levels of variables were set, the experimental matrix was defined
(see Table 8). As K = 2, the total number of experiments to be done was 4.

Table 8 Experimental Matrix Definition

#	X1	X2	
1	–	–	
2	+	–	
3	–	+	
4	+	+	
The “+” and
“–” symbols represent, respectively, the upper
and lower levels for each variable. Thus, a square design was planned,
where corners of the four combinations were explored. With these conditions,
the simple mathematical model described in eq 1 can be defined28 1  where Y is the response
value (copper ferrite purity, in this case), Xn corresponds to “+1” or “–1”
values according to Table 8, and bn are
experimentally deduced coefficients. Once the experimental values
were obtained, it was possible to predict Y at any
point in the experimental domain.28

Synthesis
For the synthesis of CuFe2O4 nanoparticles
by the polymer-assisted sol–gel method, a specific amount of
PVP (ratio 1:1 with the aimed CuFe2O4 mass)
was first dissolved in 200 mL of distilled water under stirring at
room temperature for 2 h. Then, stoichiometric amounts of each nitrate
precursor were added, and the solution was further stirred at room
temperature for three additional hours. After this, the homogeneous
solution was heated at 80 °C for 24 h in a furnace to dry the
sample and polymerize the gelling agent. Thus, a solid gel containing
a homogeneous distribution of the metal ions was obtained. To eliminate
the organic matter and obtain the desired oxide, the gel was burned
at 250 °C for 15 min in a furnace. The obtained product was further
ground to powder, and finally, calcination was done to allow the ferrite
formation. The calcination conditions are later specified for each
sample, as these are the parameters optimized by the DoE.

Characterization
For each sample, chemical composition and crystal structure were
determined by means of XRD measurements in a PANalytical X’Pert
PRO MPD θ/θ Bragg–Brentano powder diffractometer
with a radius of 240 mm using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418
Å). Particle size measurement by LD was done using an LS 13 320MW
from a Beckman Coulter device. To corroborate particle sizes, shape,
and agglomeration, SEM images were obtained with a Field Emission
SEM JEDL J-7100. Finally, magnetic properties were measured in a magnetometer
SQUID Quantum Design MPMS XL.
