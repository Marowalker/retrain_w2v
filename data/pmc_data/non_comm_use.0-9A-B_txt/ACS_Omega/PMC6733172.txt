Non-close-packed
(NCP) silica nanoparticle monolayer arrays (SNMA)
on ordered porous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) templates were fabricated
for the first time by a novel two-step spin-coating technique. The
obtained NCP-SNMA-AAO was composed of silica nanoparticles (average
primary particle size of 440 nm) and well-organized nanopores on the
AAO substrates. NCP-SNMA-AAO with a supporting ratio of 87% silica
nanoparticles showed a hydrophilic surface (water contact angle of
51.0°), while the original AAO substrate shows a hydrophobic
surface (water contact angle of 107.9°). The maximum coefficient
of static friction was decreased by 29% (0.327 → 0.233). The
coefficient of dynamic friction was also decreased by 20% (0.281 →
0.226). We found that controlling the silica supporting ratio using
the two-step spin-coating technique is an effective approach for surface
modification of an AAO substrate.

Introduction
Supporting nanoparticles
on various substrates have been studied
to realize unique functionalities. Nanoparticle monolayer arrays utilizing
self-assembly of nanosized silica (SiO2) particle dispersions
have interesting features in various material fields such as optics,1,2 photonics,3 and colloidal lithography.4 There are three typical types of silica nanoparticle
monolayer arrays (SNMAs): a random structure,5−9 a close-packed structure,2−4,7−10 and an ordered non-close-packed (NCP) structure with
regular particle spacing.11−14 Ordered NCP-SNMA is expected to induce characteristic
functionalities because of the control of the particle distance. Yan
et al. reported the fabrication of NCP-SNMA by swelling or stretching
of a dimethylpolysiloxane (PDMS) elastomer substrate.13 Xia et al. reported the fabrication of a desirable patterned
silicon substrate with silica nanoparticles by an interferometric
lithography technique to control the surface modification.11 Various ordered arrangements of silica nanoparticles
(SNs) on substrates are strongly required as photonic material designs
such as a reflectance and a structural color.1,2,6,7

As a
novel technique for fabrication of ordered NCP-SNMA, an anodic
aluminum oxide (AAO) substrate has received much attention as a nanotemplate.
It is well known that the arrangement of AAO-nanosized pores can be
controlled by electrochemical anodization conditions.15−18 For that reason, the AAO substrate is one of the famous nanotemplates
to prepare multifunctional nanomaterials such as nanoparticle arrays19,20 and nanometal pillar arrays21 for various
applications. Wang and co-workers reported the fabrication of NCP
silver nanoparticle monolayer arrays on an organized AAO substrate
by an electrochemical synthesis for surface-enhanced Raman scattering
(SERS).19 In addition, Gaponenko and co-workers
achieved the fabrication of a multilayer of disordered SNs on an AAO
substrate by an impregnation technique in the dispersion of SNs.5 An advantage of a method of supporting nanoparticles
on substrates is that synthesis conditions of the nanoparticles are
not limited by the properties of the substrates such as the chemical
resistance and heat resistance. However, the direct loading method
for the fabrication of NCP-SNMA-AAO using the dispersion of SNs and
its properties has not been investigated in detail.

In this
study, we investigated the optimal conditions for the fabrication
of NCP-SNMA in which SNs were arranged uniformly on the surface of
an AAO substrate, and we evaluated the surface physical properties
of wettability and friction. Here, we propose an AAO substrate as
a well-organized template for fabricating NCP-SNMA by the spin-coating
technique (Figure 1a). The spin-coating method is a suitable technique for the fabrication
of SNMA on various substrates other than an AAO substrate.3,7,8,11 Two-step
spin coating enables fabrication of highly filled NCP-SNMA on substrates.
Application of the two-step spin-coating technique for an AAO substrate
is expected to enable fabrication of highly filled NCP-SNMA. Adjustments
of the particle size of SNs and the pore distance of AAO are important
for fabrication of NCP-SNMA-AAO. Therefore, controlling the AAO nanostructure
is also one of the key factors for the fabrication of NCP-SNMA-AAO.

Consequently, highly filled NCP-SNMA on an AAO
substrate was successfully
fabricated by the two-step spin-coating technique. The results showed
that the AAO substrate can be used as a template for fabrication of
NCP-SNMA without surface modification of the particles. Furthermore,
the characteristic surface physical properties were changed by the
silica supporting ratio on the AAO substrate. The NCP-SNMA obtained
on the AAO substrate indicates the possibility of controlling the
surface wettability (hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity) and the friction
coefficient to improve surface physical properties of AAO substrates.

Results
and Discussion
Preparation of an AAO Substrate and an Aqueous
Dispersion of
Silica Nanoparticles
An AAO film was fabricated on a high
purity aluminum plate by two-step anodization in the area of the red
solid box (approximately 1 × 3 cm) as shown in Figure 2a. Nanopores with a relatively
uniform pore size distribution were observed on the AAO substrate
surface by an FESEM as shown in Figure 2b,c. Figure 2d shows the pore distance distribution of the AAO substrate
measured with an image analyzer. The center position of the nanopores
of the AAO substrate was measured manually. The AAO substrate had
an average pore distance of 550±81 nm and a coefficient of variation
(CV) of 14.6%. Figure 3a shows an FESEM image of SNs in the aqueous dispersion, which is
shown in Figure 3c.
As shown in Figure 3a, nonporous and spherical particles with a narrow particle size
distribution were observed. Figure 3b shows the particle size distribution in the FESEM
image of the SNs measured with the image analyzer. The SNs had an
average particle size of 440±20 nm and a CV of 4.6% with a narrow
distribution.

Fabrication of SNMA Supported on an AAO Substrate
To
obtain the SNMA, the influence of the rotation speed by the one-step
spin-coating method in the supported state of SNs on the AAO substrate
was investigated. The change in the loading condition of the SNs on
the AAO substrate with change in the spinning rate is shown in Figure 4. For samples prepared
at 200 and 500 rpm, the SNs were arranged as accumulated highly filled
multilayers on most of the surface of the AAO substrate as shown in Figure 4a,b, respectively.
This self-assembled multilayered structure of SNs was formed by the
interparticle capillary force of the SNs during the drying process
as shown in Figure 4g as a schematic illustration model.23 For the samples prepared at 1000 and 2000 rpm, the SNs were arranged
as a monolayer or a double layer on the surface of the AAO substrate
as shown in Figure 4c,d, respectively. It is possible that these morphologies were formed
due to the nonuniform presence of the aqueous dispersion of SNs on
the AAO substrate during spin coatings as shown in Figure 4h as a schematic illustration
model. For the samples prepared at 3000 rpm, the SNs were arranged
as a monolayer on the nanopores of the AAO substrate as shown in Figure 4e. As the rotation
speed is increased, it is possible that the monolayer of SNs was formed
due to the uniform presence of the aqueous dispersion of SNs on the
AAO substrate during spin coating. As a result, we succeeded in obtaining
uniform SNMA-AAO at 3000 rpm as shown in Figure 4i. The supporting ratio of the obtained SNMA-AAO
at 3000 rpm was shown to be 28% by using the image analyzer. The rotation
speed is one of the important parameters of spin coating for fabricating
SNMA-AAO.

We demonstrated fabrication
of SNMA-AAO with a supporting ratio
of 28% at 3000 rpm for 10 s by the one-step spin-coating method. Although
SNMA-AAO was obtained, a supporting ratio of 28% was insufficient.
Therefore, optimal conditions using the two-step technique were investigated
to obtain highly filled SNMA-AAO. Ogi and co-workers reported that
highly filled close-packed SNMA could be obtained on a sapphire (monocrystal
aluminum oxide) substrate with a super smooth surface by changing
the rotation speed during spin coating in two steps.7 The two-step spin-coating technique consists of two processes.
In the first step with the low rotation speed, the uniform and optimal
thickness of the dispersion on the substrate is obtained by optimizing
both the removal amount of the dispersion by the centrifugal force
and the evaporation rate of the dispersion medium. As a result, the
uniformity of self-assembly of the nanoparticles guided by immersion
capillary forces is improved. In the second step with the high rotation
speed, the nanoparticles near the surface of the substrate are attached
on the substrate due to increase of surface capillary forces caused
by the rapid evaporation of the dispersion medium. Application of
the two-step spin-coating technique for the AAO substrate having the
nanostructure is expected to enable fabrication of highly filled NCP-SNMA.
In the experiments, the effects of the first-step rotation time and
silica concentration when using the two-step spin-coating method were
investigated. Changes in the SNs on the AAO substrate with changes
in the first-step rotation time and silica concentration are shown
in Figure 5. With first-step
rotation times of 10 and 30 s and a silica concentration of 10 wt
%, SNs were arranged as a monolayer on almost all of the surface of
the AAO substrate as shown in Figure 5b,c, respectively. A schematic illustration model is
shown in Figure 5j.
The supporting ratios were 55 and 49%. The supporting ratio of SNMA-AAO
was increased by approximately two times when the two-step spin-coating
technique was used. This result showed that the two-step spin-coating
technique is effective for AAO substrates with nanostructures as well
as sapphire substrates with a super smooth surface. With first-step
rotation times of 0 and 10 s and a silica concentration of 20 wt %,
SNs were arranged as a double layer on almost all of the surface of
the AAO substrate as shown in Figure 5e,f, respectively. A schematic illustration model is
shown in Figure 5i.
The formation of a double-layered structure of SNs was promoted by
increasing the silica concentration in the dispersion. With a first-step
rotation time of 60 s and silica concentrations of 10 and 20 wt %,
SNs were partially arranged as double layers on the surface of the
AAO substrate as shown in Figure 5d,h, respectively. A schematic illustration model is
shown in Figure 5i.
As the first-step rotation time was increased, a partial double-layered
structure of SNs was formed by evaporating the dispersion medium of
the SNs before the second-step spin-coating process. With a first-step
rotation time of 30 s and a silica concentration of 20 wt %, SNs were
arranged as a highly filled monolayer on almost all of the surfaces
of the AAO substrate as shown in Figure 5g. A schematic illustration model is shown
in Figure 5k. The supporting
ratio of SNMA-AAO was 87%. A NCP structure of the obtained SNMA-AAO
with a supporting ratio of 87% was observed as shown in Figure 6. The average particle distance
of the NCP-SNMA was shown to be 120±56 nm by using the image
analyzer (see Figure S1). Additionally,
the appearance of the obtained NCP-SNMA-AAO substrate slightly changed
to a matte tone. A highly filled NCP-SNMA-AAO was obtained with a
first-step rotation time of 30 s and a silica concentration of 20
wt %. By optimizing the rotation speed, rotation time, and silica
concentration when using the two-step spin-coating method, we succeeded
in the fabrication of a highly filled NCP-SNMA-AAO with a supporting
ratio of 87% as shown in Figure 6c as a schematic illustration model. We also showed
that not only could highly filled NCP-SNMA be obtained on the AAO
substrate with a nanostructure as well as on sapphire substrates with
a super smooth surface but also the SNs were preferentially supported
on the nanopores of the AAO substrate. Mathur and co-workers reported
the polystyrene nanoparticles were preferentially arranged in the
nanosized shallow valleys of the corrugated Si substrates and suggested
the ordering force caused by the surface nanoroughness of the substrates.24 Schmudde and co-workers reported the SNs having
the nanoroughness surface were arranged as NCP-SNMA on the nanostructured
Au substrates due to the increase of friction forces between the nanoparticles
and substrates.25 It is believed that the
SNs are preferentially arranged in the AAO nanopore due to the surface
nanoroughness of the AAO substrates.

Characterization of the SNMA-AAO Substrate
It is generally
known that wettability changes due to the lotus effect caused by nanostructures
on a solid surface.26−28 For example, Lee et al. reported change in the wettability
by fabricating ordered nanostructures on a polystyrene substrate.26 Thus, it was expected that wettability on the
SNMA-AAO substrate would be changed by varying the nanostructure.
Therefore, the water contact angles of SNMA-AAO with different supporting
ratios were investigated.

Figure 7 shows the contact angles and optical images of 1 μL
of DI water of SNMA-AAO substrates with different supporting ratios.
The water contact angle is an average value of three measurement results
(n = 3). Error bars indicate one standard deviation
(SD). The water contact angles with supporting ratios of 0, 28, 49,
55, and 87% were 107.3 ± 0.7, 103.5 ± 0.7, 107.7 ±
1.5, 99.2 ± 1.2, and 51.0 ± 3.0°, respectively. The
water contact angle of the AAO substrate (with a supporting ratio
of 0%) was hydrophobic with 107.3 ± 0.7°. The pore size
of the AAO substrate of about 150–380 nm shows hydrophobicity
due to the lotus effect.27 The produced
AAO substrate showed the same hydrophobicity as that in the literature.

Figure 7 (a) Water
contact angles on AAO substrates at different supporting
ratios of silica nanoparticles on AAO nanopores. Circle solid and
box symbols refer to the measured water contact angles and the calculated
water contact angles, respectively. An error bar means one standard
deviation (SD). (b)–(f) Optical images of DI water droplets
on AAO substrates at different supporting ratios of silica nanoparticles.

SNMA-AAO substrates with supporting ratios of 28,
49, and 55% had
hydrophobic surfaces similar to that of the AAO substrate. On the
other hand, the surface of the highly filled NCP-SNMA-AAO substrate
with a supporting ratio of 87% was changed from hydrophobic to hydrophilic
with a water contact angle of 51.0 ± 3.0°. The hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity
of the AAO substrate surface can be controlled by the supporting ratio
of SNMA.

It is well known that wettability of a rough surface
can be described
by the Wenzel model and the Cassie–Baxter model that express
heterogeneous and homogeneous states, respectively. Apparent contact
angles of a rough surface are given by the Wenzel equation (θW) and the Cassie–Baxter equation (θCB), respectively: 1   2  where r is the surface roughness
factor, θY is the Young’s contact angle of
a smooth surface, f1 and f2 are ratio of two different materials, and θ1 and θ2 are each Young’s contact angle
of two different materials, respectively.29,30 However, the Cassie–Baxter equation cannot express the heterogeneous
surface composed of three different materials such as the SNMA-AAO
substrates. Therefore, the contact angle for the heterogeneous surface
composed of three different materials is defined by the expanded Cassie–Baxter
equation (θECB): 3  According to the Cassie–Baxter (eq 2) and the measurement result
by using the image analyzer as shown in Figure S2, a calculated contact angle of the obtained AAO substrate
was 103°. The result was close to the measured contact angle
of 107.3 ± 0.7°. On the other hand, according to the expanded
Cassie–Baxter (eq 3) and measurement results by using the image analyzer as shown in Figure S3 and Table S1, calculated contact angles
of the SNMA-AAO substrates with supporting ratios of 28, 49, 55, and
87% were 89, 81, 76, and 64°, respectively. The calculated contact
angles of the SNMA-AAO substrates showed a different value from the
measured contact angles of 107.3 ± 0.7, 103.5 ± 0.7, 107.7
± 1.5, 99.2 ± 1.2, and 51.0 ± 3.0°, respectively.

Figure 8 shows a
schematic illustration of the water contact angle of the SNMA-AAO
substrate with each supporting ratio of SNs. The AAO substrate showed
hydrophobicity due to the Cassie–Baxter state as shown in Figure 8a. On the other hand,
the highly filled NCP-SNMA-AAO with a supporting ratio of 87% showed
hydrophilicity. It is well known that the surfaces of SNs exhibit
hydrophilicity due to silanol groups.31 Hydrophilicity of the highly filled NCP-SNMA-AAO probably occurred
due to the silanol groups of SNs and changed from the Cassie–Baxter
state to the Wenzel state as shown in Figure 8c. However, the half-filled SNMA-AAO showed
the same hydrophobicity as the AAO substrate. The result indicated
the surface state of the half-filled SNMA-AAO maintained the Cassie–Baxter
state as shown in Figure 8b. In addition, hydrophobicity due to the nanostructure of
the AAO substrate might be stronger than hydrophilicity due to the
silanol group of SNs.

Figure 8 Illustrations of silica nanoparticles on AAO nanopores
at supporting
ratios of (a) 0%, (b) 49%, and (c) 87%.

As other surface properties, it is known that a friction coefficient
varies with changes in surface structures. For example, Choi et al.
reported that the friction coefficient of AAO substrates was varied
by changes in the pore size and porosity of AAO substrates.32 Zhang et al. reported that the friction coefficient
of the AAO substrate laminated with PTFE particles by the electrophoresis
method was decreased.33 Thus, it was expected
that the friction coefficient on the SNMA-AAO substrate would be changed
by varying the nanostructure. Therefore, the friction coefficient
of the highly filled SNMA-AAO substrate was investigated.

Figure 9 shows the
coefficients of dynamic friction and the maximum coefficients of static
friction of the AAO substrate and the highly filled NCP-SNMA-AAO substrate
with a supporting ratio of 87%. The coefficient of dynamic friction
and the maximum coefficient of static friction were obtained automatically
from the measurement results as shown in Figure S4. Each friction coefficient is an average value of three
measurement results (n = 3). Error bars indicate
one standard deviation (SD).

AAO substrate and (b)
the highly filled NCP-SNMA-AAO substrate. Maximum coefficients of
static friction of (c) the AAO substrate and (d) the highly filled
NCP-SNMA-AAO substrate.

The coefficients of dynamic
friction of the AAO substrate and the
highly filled NCP-SNMA-AAO substrate were 0.281 ± 0.18 and 0.226
± 0.08, respectively, and the maximum coefficients of static
friction of the AAO substrate and the highly filled NCP-SNMA-AAO substrate
were 0.327 ± 0.09 and 0.233 ± 0.05, respectively. The coefficient
of dynamic friction and the maximum coefficient of static friction
of the highly filled NCP-SNMA-AAO substrate were decreased by 20 and
29%, respectively. Additionally, the difference between the coefficient
of dynamic friction and the maximum coefficient of static friction
became small, from 0.046 to 0.007. Figure 10 shows a schematic illustration of the friction
coefficient measurements of the AAO substrate and the highly filled
NCP-SNMA-AAO substrate. It is possible that the decrease in the friction
coefficient of the highly filled NCP-SNMA-AAO substrate was caused
by the reduction in the contact area of the measurement probe because
of the convex structure by SNs on the nanopores of the AAO substrate.
We showed that the highly filled NCP-SNMA on the AAO substrate have
a lubricating function.

Conclusions
The supporting conditions
of SNMA on the surface of an AAO substrate
by the spin-coating method were investigated. We successfully fabricated
a highly filled NCP-SNMA-AAO by optimizing the spin-coating conditions
without surface modification of the SNs and AAO substrate. The two-step
spin-coating technique is an effective technique for fabricating the
highly filled SNMA not only on flat substrates but also on nanostructured
substrates. An AAO substrate is an important substrate as a template
for fabricating NCP nanoparticle monolayer arrays. The surface wettability
of the highly filled NCP-SNMA-AAO changed from hydrophobicity to hydrophilicity
(107.9 → 51.0°). Moreover, both the maximum coefficient
of static friction and the coefficient of dynamic friction were decreased
by 29% (0.327 → 0.233) and 20% (0.281 → 0.226), respectively.
Controlling the surface wettability (hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity)
and the friction coefficient by the obtained SNMA-AAO is expected
to improve the surface physical properties of an AAO substrate.

commercial silica nanoparticles (Snowtex MP-4540M, silica concentration
of 40 wt %, pH value of 9.3) was provided by Nissan Chemical Corporation.
Deionized water (DI water) with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ·cm
that was obtained from Milli Q integral5 (Merck Millipore) was used
in all experiments.

Preparation of an AAO Substrate
An AAO substrate was
fabricated using the two-step anodization method.15,18 The anodization condition was adjusted according to the particle
size of SNs. A high purity aluminum plate of 1 mm in thickness was
cut into rectangular specimens of 10 × 50 mm in size. Each specimen
of the high purity aluminum plate was degreased in acetone with ultrasonification
for 10 min at room temperature. After drying the specimen, it was
electropolished under a constant current of 0.2 A/cm2 (direct-current
stabilized power supply device, CPS-3025L, CUSTOM Corporation) in
a 4:1 volume mixture of ethyl alcohol and 60 wt % perchloric acid
for 10 min at 1–5 °C to reduce surface roughness. The
specimen was used as an anode, and a platinum plate was used as a
cathode. After the electropolishing, the specimen was rinsed in DI
water for more than 30 min. The electropolished specimen was first
anodized under a constant voltage of 200 V (compact DC power supply,
PMX350-0.2A, Kikusui Electronics Corporation) in 0.1 wt % phosphoric
acid solution for 8 h at 20 °C with stirring. After the first
anodization, the AAO film was rinsed several times in DI water, and
the AAO film was removed by immersing the specimen in a mixture of
5 wt % phosphoric acid and 1.8 wt % chromic acid solution for 2 h
at 60 °C. The specimen was rinsed again several times in DI water
and reanodized under a constant voltage of 200 V in 0.1 wt % phosphoric
acid solution for 2 h at 20 °C with stirring. After the second
anodization, the obtained AAO substrate was rinsed several times in
DI water and was dried at room temperature for 1 day under an air
atmosphere.

Preparation of a Dispersion of Silica Nanoparticles
An aqueous dispersion of SNs (Snowtex MP-4540M) was centrifuged
at
1000g for 20 min at 20 °C. After removal of
the supernatant, the same volume of DI water as the supernatant was
added, and the SNs were redispersed by ultrasonification. These centrifugation–redispersion
processes were repeated seven times. The silica concentration of the
purified aqueous dispersion of SNs was adjusted to 10 or 20 wt %,
and the pH value was adjusted to 10 with DI water and 0.1 mol/L sodium
hydroxide solution. The adjusted aqueous dispersion of SNs was filtrated
(1.0 μm membrane filter, Whatman Puradisc PES Syringe Filters,
GE Healthcare) before spin coating.

Spin-Coating of Silica
Nanoparticles
The AAO substrate
was placed on a spin coater (MS-B100, Mikasa Co., Ltd.). The spin-coating
methods used in the experiments were the one-step technique and the
two-step technique (see Figure 1b,c). The two-step technique is a supporting technique for
obtaining a high-density monolayer of nanoparticles on the substrate
in which the substrate is spun at a low spin speed (first step) to
make the dispersion uniform on the substrate and then accelerated
to a second higher spin speed (second step) to remove excess dispersion.7 For all spin-coating experiments, 0.5 mL of 10
or 20 wt % SN aqueous dispersion (pH 10) was used. The AAO substrate
was spun at 200–3000 rpm for 10–60 s at room temperature
and at a relative humidity of 50–60%. The layer of SNs supported
on the AAO substrate was dried at room temperature for 1 day under
an air atmosphere.

Characterization
The fabricated
AAO substrate, the
adjusted aqueous dispersion of SNs, and the supported state of SNs
on AAO pores were observed with a field emission scanning electron
microscope (FESEM, JSM-7400F, JEOL Ltd.) at 1 kV. By analyzing the
FESEM images with an image analyzer (Luzex AP, Nireco Corporation),
the pore distance (D) and the ratio of the pore area
(f2) of the AAO substrate, the particle
size (R) of the SNs, the particle distance (d), the ratio of the area (f3), and the supporting ratio (S) of the SNs supported
on the AAO substrate were calculated. The supporting ratio (S) was calculated only when SNMA-AAO was obtained and by
the following equation: 4  

The wettability and friction coefficient
of the obtained SNMA-AAO were estimated by using a contact angle meter
(DM-501Hi, Kyowa Interface Science Co., Ltd.) at a DI water droplet
of 1 μL and a variable normal load friction and a wear measurement
system (Tribogear Type: HHS2000, Shinto Scientific Co., Ltd.) at a
load of 100 g, a velocity of 1 mm/s, and a measurement range of 10
mm.
