We
employ energy-momentum spectroscopy on isolated organic single
crystals with micrometer-sized dimensions. The single crystals are
grown from a thiophene-based oligomer and are excellent low-loss active
waveguides that support multiple guided modes. Excitation of the crystals
with a diffraction-limited laser spot results in emission into guided
modes as well as into quasi-discrete radiation modes. These radiation
modes are mapped in energy-momentum space and give rise to dispersive
interference patterns. On the basis of the known geometry of the crystals,
especially the height, the characteristics of the interference maxima
allow one to determine the energy dependence of two components of
the anisotropic complex refractive index. Moreover, the method is
suited to identify the orientation of molecules within (and around)
a crystalline structure.

Introduction
Organic micro- and
nanostructures attract great attention in fundamental
as well as applied research.1,2 Many applications have
been established, e.g., displays, field effect transistors, waveguides,3−5 and Mach–Zehnder interferometers.6 Low-loss waveguiding in cavity-like organic nanostructures has enabled
laser operation based on fluorescent7−10 or on phosphorescent transitions.11

Inside such micro- and nanostructures,
organic molecules are arranged
in a highly ordered fashion and are thus in close proximity to each
other. This well-defined, tight packing enables coherent coupling
between molecules,12−14 transport of excitons on ultrafast timescales15 and over long distances.16 The spontaneous emission of organic molecules, which are
arranged within these structures, and the available optical modes
of the structures couple. In the strong coupling regime, the emission
becomes reversible and energy is periodically exchanged between light
and matter,17 which strongly depends on
material properties. This regime is usually achieved by exploiting
microcavities18 and is currently under
investigation exploiting organic dye nanofibers,19 single-crystal microcavities,20 J-aggregate-doped waveguides,21 among
others. By contrast, in the weak coupling regime, which is relevant
in this study, the rate of spontaneous emission is modified by the
local density of optical states. Hence, the radiation characteristics
of emitters within micro- and nanostructures are a complex function
of emission energy and direction.

A very powerful method to
directly map the directivity of the emission
is back-focal-plane imaging.5,22−24 The back focal plane of an objective is the Fourier plane of its
real space front focal plane, where the sample is located. Thus, it
is possible to distinguish the in-plane photon momenta of the emission,
i.e., the projections of the momentum on the sample plane, which yields
directly information about radiation direction. This technique also
allows one to map interference effects of multiple coherently prepared
but spatially separated emitters.25 The
back-focal-plane imaging can be expanded to energy-momentum spectroscopy,
where not only the radiation direction but also the energy of the
emission is recorded.26−29 Thus, two-dimensional intensity maps with an energy and an in-plane
momentum axis result. In addition, this technique can be combined
with wide-angle30 and time-resolved detection
schemes.31

A full description of
light propagation in organic structures,
especially in waveguides, requires a continuum of radiation modes
and a discrete number of guided modes. Radiation modes are not completely
confined in the waveguide and typically leak into the adjacent medium
with the highest refractive index, e.g., a glass substrate. In contrast,
light in a guided mode propagates along the waveguide by sequential
total internal reflection at the boundaries, which completely confine
the light inside the organic structure. A key parameter to describe
optical waveguides is their refractive index, because, together with
the geometry of the entire system (waveguide and surrounding media),
it defines the available transverse electric and transverse magnetic
waveguide modes. However, the determination of refractive index components
of such typically micrometer-sized organic structures is challenging,
because they are typically highly anisotropic, which is relevant for
a detailed understanding of light propagation.3,32

To determine the refractive index components of organic waveguides,
several approaches exist: First, the components can be guessed,10 which, however, can be inaccurate. Second, a
group refractive index can be determined via Fabry–Pérot
resonances present in the outcoupled spectrum of cavity-like nanostructures.4,6,19 This method only yields an effective
group refractive index for the investigated waveguide mode. The refractive
index itself cannot be determined, because the propagation angle of
the mode remains unknown. Third, the components can be inferred from
angular-resolved, polarized transmission and reflection spectra.33 The drawback of this method is that for isolated
micrometer-sized object, these spectra can be distorted by diffraction.
Finally, for flat layers, a common method to determine the refractive
index is ellipsometry, but spot sizes down to the micrometer scale
require sophisticated imaging spectroscopic ellipsometry.34−36

Here, we report a method to determine the complex refractive
index
components of isolated, well-defined micrometer-sized organic single
crystals by fitting energy-momentum spectra with an ensemble of radiating
electric dipoles in a multilayer geometry. Our approach is based on
self-interference of the emission of crystals that support multiple
propagating modes. In the far field, self-interference results in
a complex intensity pattern in energy-momentum space, which features
a dispersive shape of the interference maxima and can be related to
the number of propagating (substrate) modes.

Results and Discussion
Crystal
Structure and Optical Properties of 3TBT Single Crystals
The organic single crystals studied here are based on so-called
3TBT molecules (Figure 1a). Each molecule consists of a sequence of three TBT monomers,37 with each monomer having a central dialkoxybenzene
unit (denoted by B) with two octyl groups attached orthogonally to
the backbone of the molecule. The dialkoxybenzene unit is sandwiched
by two thiophene rings (denoted by T). The growth of 3TBT single crystals
is driven by π–π interactions between the conjugated
backbones of the 3TBT molecules. Hence, the crystals possess an elongated
geometry with one dominant long axis (y direction, Figure 1a), and the 3TBT
backbone (x direction) is oriented perpendicularly
to this long axis. Figure 1b shows the optical properties of the 3TBT crystals. The absorption
is highly anisotropic and is stronger for a polarization parallel
to the orientation of the 3TBT backbone as compared to a polarization
parallel to the long axis of the crystal. This anisotropy arises from
the orientation of the transition dipole moment along the backbone
of 3TBT. We note that the absorption and emission does not result
from transition dipole moments of 3TBT itself. The close proximity
of adjacent, π-stacked 3TBT molecules gives rise to strong electronic
interactions between molecules and thus to the formation of delocalized
exciton states. Each exciton state still possesses a transition dipole
moment pointing along the x direction, because it
is constructed from a weighted vector sum of x-oriented
3TBT transition dipole moments.38

Figure 1 (a) Sketch
showing the chemical structure of the 3TBT molecules
and their arrangement in the single crystals.5,39 The x direction denotes the orientation of the molecules’
backbone, whereas the y direction is the long axis
of the crystal, along which adjacent molecules are stacked in a π–π
fashion. (b) Emission (red) and absorption (blue) spectra of 3TBT
single crystals. To demonstrate the anisotropy in absorption, the
spectra were acquired with x- and y-polarized light (ODx and ODy).

The emission spectrum
of the crystal features a distorted vibronic
progression compared to the spectrum of molecularly dissolved 3TBT
in solution (cf. Figure 2 in our recent study39), which is characteristic
for molecules that are arranged in a π–π (or H-type)
fashion.40,41 The mean energy difference between the vibronic
peaks is about 0.17 eV and indicates coupling to carbon-bond stretch
modes. The emission strongly overlaps with the absorption around 2.3
eV, which gives rise to substantial reabsorption of the light emitted
from within the crystal. To suppress the influence of reabsorption
on the emission spectrum as much as possible, we collected only emission
with minimal propagation distance within the crystal by momentum filtering
(see Figure S1, Supporting Information
(SI) for details). More details concerning the crystal structure,
as well as absorption and emission of 3TBT molecules in solution,
thin film, and single crystals can be found in our recent study.39

upon confocal excitation at the position marked with the vector 0⃗xy, see also (a).

Figure 2a
shows
an atomic force microscope (AFM) image of a part of the 3TBT single
crystal considered in the following. The topography confirms a nearly
homogeneous width of about 4.5 μm and a height of about 3.3
μm only slightly varying with position along the crystal’s
long axis. This very smooth geometry has recently enabled active waveguiding
of the emission generated inside such crystals with a remarkably low
loss during propagation over several tens of micrometers.5Figure 2b displays a widefield image of the same crystal position
as shown in the AFM image (after rotation of the crystal to align
its long axis (y direction) along the vertical axis
of our charge-coupled-device cameras (CCDs)). The crystal shows a
bright homogeneous emission on a very low background. Its length along
the y direction is several tens of micrometers, whereas
the width of the crystal (x direction) is about 4.5
μm, consistent with the AFM measurement. Figure 2c shows the spatially resolved emission upon
confocal excitation of the crystal with a diffraction-limited laser
spot at the position marked with the vector 0⃗xy (see also Figure S2,
SI). We observe strong emission at the excitation spot and weaker
emission fading away with distance from the excitation spot. We attribute
this weak emission to leakage radiation from propagating substrate
modes. These emission features can interfere in energy-momentum space
as will be demonstrated in the following.

Fourier Microscopy
To investigate the directionality
of the single-crystal’s emission, we exploit back-focal-plane
imaging upon local excitation of the crystal at the position marked
with 0⃗xy in Figure 2a,c. In general, the emission in the back-focal-plane
image (see Figure S2c, SI) is largely confined
within two characteristic circles: an inner circle defined by the
total internal reflection condition at the crystal–air interface
and an outer circle given by the numerical aperture of our microscope
objective, i.e., by the maximum collection angle. Moreover, we observe
two emission lobes with in-plane momentum parallel to the ky direction in Fourier space,
which demonstrates directional emission characteristics parallel to
the long axis of the crystal (y direction in real
space). We attribute this emission to traveling radiation modes in
the crystal leaking into the substrate medium. In addition, there
are guided waves totally confined inside the crystal geometry that
gives rise to outcoupled emission at the end facets of the crystals,
see Figure S1a, SI and ref (5). However, the length of
the crystal investigated here does not allow one to detect this signal.

Owing to the pronounced anisotropy of the 3TBT single crystals,
with their dominant long (y) axis and the orientation
of the 3TBT transition dipole moment along the x direction,
additional information can be obtained by adding a polarizer in the
detection path. In this situation, emission that is polarized perpendicular
to the polarizer axis is suppressed. For a polarizer axis oriented
in the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) directions, the back-focal-plane images of the emission are shown
in Figure 3a,b, respectively.
For horizontal orientation of the polarizer axis, the radiation characteristics
show nearly no preferred directions of in-plane momenta (see Figure 3a). There is only
one prominent feature in the proximity of kx = k0 and ky ≈ 0 (see black arrow in Figure 3a), i.e., a sideward
radiation of the crystal’s emission mainly in the positive kx direction. The asymmetry
of this emission can be explained by a slightly shifted excitation
position with respect to the center of the crystal, resulting in a
symmetry breaking along the x direction. A distinctly
different radiation characteristic is collected for a vertical orientation
(y direction) of the polarizer axis (Figure 3b). In this case, two distinct
radiation lobes can be observed in the positive and negative ky directions, i.e., along the
long axis of the crystal. In particular, there is no emission with ky = 0

images of the emission upon local excitation

angle and the angle of the polarizer axis, respectively, measured
against the positive kx direction. (c, d) Corresponding polarization-resolved energy-momentum
spectra with the spectrometer slit along the y direction

emission in (d) is about a factor of 1.4 higher than that in (c).
The dashed lines indicate the energy, along which profiles are shown
in Figure 4b,c. (e,
f) Simulated energy-momentum spectra.

The back-focal-plane image acquired with polarizer axis along
the
vertical (y) direction (Figure 3b) appears surprising at the first glance.
On the basis of the crystal structure with only x-oriented 3TBT molecules (transition dipole moments), we would expect
a completely suppressed emission in this situation. In fact, the absence
of emission with in-plane momentum parallel to the kx direction clearly demonstrates that y-oriented transition dipole moments are indeed not present
in the crystal. Because x-polarized emission is suppressed
by the polarizer, the emission with in-plane momentum parallel to
the ky direction requires
transition dipole moments with a substantial z-component.
The polarizer modulates the emission intensity of these z-oriented transition dipole moments in momentum space with the square
of cos(ϕ – ϕpol), where ϕ is the
azimuthal angle in the Fourier plane and ϕpol is
the angle of the polarizer axis. Both angles can be measured against
an arbitrary reference direction, here the positive kx axis (cf. Figure 3b). Because of the vertical polarizer axis
(ϕpol = 90°) and the length of the crystal, z-oriented transition dipole moments yield a maximum of
the emission in the ky direction (ϕ = 90°). The origin of these out-of-plane
transition dipole moments can be traced back to the presence of a
thin layer of 3TBT nanofibers at the single-crystal surface, which
are aligned along the long (y) axis of the single
crytal.39 They appear to be randomly twisted
around their y axis so that a substantial fraction
of emitters with z-oriented transition dipole moments
is present. Although there could be several layers of nanofibers,
the resulting surface roughness is small compared to the wavelength
of light,39 and thus no big deviation from
flat single-crystal surfaces considered in our simulations is expected.

The back-focal-plane image with horizontally (x-) oriented polarizer axis (Figure 3a) can then be interpreted as emission from a superposition
of x- and z-oriented transition
dipole moments. First, transition dipole moments with orientation
in the x direction give rise to emission with in-plane
momentum mainly parallel to the ky direction. Second, according to the above discussion, the
modulation of the emission of z-oriented transition
dipole moments in momentum space results in a maximum emission with
in-plane momentum parallel to the kx direction, if the polarizer axis is along the x direction.

To summarize this section, back-focal-plane images
measured with
a horizontal polarizer axis (x direction) allow one
to detect transition dipole moments oriented along the x and z directions. In contrast, images acquired
with a vertical axis (y direction) of the polarizer
allow one to detect transition dipole moments exclusively oriented
along the z direction, because y-oriented transition dipole moments are not present in our 3TBT crystals.

Energy-Momentum Spectroscopy
In our recent study we
exclusively studied the radiation characteristics of 3TBT crystals.5 Here we expand our investigation to energy-momentum
spectroscopy. Flipping in the Bertrand lens, the back focal plane
is imaged onto the plane of the spectrometer entrance slit, which
acts as a vertical aperture. Thus, the slit serves as a vertical intersection
through the back focal plane along the ky direction (dashed lines in Figure 3a,b), and we only collect emission with in-plane
momentum kx ≈
0. In combination with a polarizer in front of the spectrometer, we
are able to investigate the energy-momentum spectra of x-oriented transition dipole moments (polarizer along the x direction) and of z-oriented transition
dipole moments (polarizer along the y direction),
see Figure 3c,d.

For the case of a horizontally oriented (x direction)
polarizer axis, several intensity maxima can be clearly observed in
the full range from ky = −NA·k0 to +NA·k0 (Figure 3c). This pattern reflects the emission of the transition
dipole moments, placed within the excited crystal volume, into different
radiation modes. For |ky| > k0, we attribute the emission
to
substrate modes, i.e., radiation modes with losses only into the substrate
medium and not into the air above the crystal. These losses are observed
in the energy-momentum spectra, and the intensity patterns with distinct
maxima and minima reflect the quasi-discrete nature of these modes.
The bending of the emission maxima as a function of energy reflects
the dispersive behavior of the energy-dependent refractive index (see
below).

Another way of explaining these patterns is self-interference.
The emission sent out from the excitation volume can reach the far
field with in-plane momentum k∥ through different pathways, see Figure 4a. First, emission
can directly leave the crystal medium from the excitation spot and
propagate into the substrate. Second, emission can travel to the top
3TBT–air interface, get (partially) reflected, travel back
down, and leave the crystal to the substrate. Finally, there are pathways,
which include multiple reflections inside the crystal before leaking
into the substrate. The emitting transition dipole moment defines
the phase of the emission, and thus coherent superposition of all
partial waves in the far field (toward the substrate) results in constructive
and destructive interference. Hence, the patterns in energy-momentum
space map the interference of the emitter’s emission with itself.
We note that this interference patterns cannot be resolved in the
back-focal-plane images (Figure 3a,b) due to the averaging over all energies. Importantly,
when the height of the crystal is decreased, we generally observe
less fringes (Figure S4, SI), though with
similar characteristics. For such thinner crystals, the propagation
angle of each mode (θ2 in Figure 4a) becomes larger, which results in a smaller
number of propagating modes available and thus in a smaller number
of interference maxima. Thus, the “spacing” between
the emission maxima in Fourier space also becomes larger, in agreement
with the self-interference picture. For very thin crystals, we do
not observe any fringes (see Figure S1c, SI).

Figure 4 (a) Sketch of the sample with its three-layer geometry. Emitters
are placed in the 3TBT crystal (layer 2), which is sandwiched between
the glass substrate (layer 1) and air (layer 3). For further details,
see text. (b) Profiles of the experimental radiation characteristics
(blue) extracted at energies of 2.03 eV (top) and 2.27 eV (bottom)
from the data in Figure 3c for horizontal orientation of the polarizer axis. The corresponding
simulations of x-oriented dipole ensembles are shown
as black lines. (c) Profiles of the experimental radiation characteristics
(blue) extracted at energies of 2.00 eV (top) and 2.33 eV (bottom)
from the data in Figure 3d for vertical orientation of the polarizer axis. The corresponding
simulations of z-oriented dipole ensembles are shown
as black lines.

A prominent property
of the emission pattern in Figure 3c is that for energies above
2.15 eV, the contrast of the interference pattern decreases rapidly
to zero and the distinct fringes disappear. In this energy range,
the emission can travel only over very short distances in the crystal
due to high reabsorption losses (see Figure 1b and ref (5)). Therefore, pathways including multiple reflections
are negligible and only the direct path to the substrate remains.

For the case of a vertically oriented (y direction)
polarizer axis, we observe a qualitatively similar pattern with several
interference maxima in the energy-momentum spectrum (Figure 3d). This pattern is mainly
visible in the range of 1 < |ky|/k0 < NA, consistent with the
corresponding back-focal-plane image in Figure 3b. For energies above 2.2 eV, the intensity
decreases rapidly to zero, faster than for the case of the horizontal
orientation of the polarizer.

Simulation of Dipoles in
the Three-Layer System
To
get insight into the interference patterns, we perform simulations
of oriented electric dipoles in a multilayer geometry (layer 1: glass
substrate; layer 2: 3TBT crystal; and layer 3: air). A sketch is given
in Figure 4a. Importantly,
these simulations allow us to determine the anisotropic refractive
index components of 3TBT crystals. We use a uniaxial approximation
of the crystal, because we expect a higher polarizability of the electron
density along the conjugated backbone of the 3TBT molecules (x direction) compared to the perpendicular (y and z) directions. Therefore, the principal axis
of the uniaxial medium is taken to be the x axis.
The dipole approximation in the simulations is justified by the fact
that the emission originates from transition dipole moments of excitonic
states that are expected to be delocalized over only a few (∼3)
3TBT molecules in the y (π-stacking) direction,
based on theoretical studies on thiophene-based conjugated polymers.40 Thus, the spatial extent of the emitting exciton
is expected to be very small compared to the wavelength of light.
In the simulations, all three media are taken to be infinitely large
layers in the x–y plane.
The experimental widefield images do not allow one to visualize the
entire length of the crystal; hence, it can be considered in good
approximation as infinitely long in the y direction.
In the energy-momentum spectra, we only collect emission parallel
to this ky direction. Therefore, effects
on the energy-momentum spectra due to the finite width of the crystal
in the x direction are minimized, and the three-layer
approximation allows one to study the main features of the energy-momentum
spectra.

The radiation characteristics along the ky direction into the substrate layer
1, which sensitively depends on the angle θ2 (Figure 4a), are calculated
by reciprocity (see Calculation of Energy-Momentum Spectra, SI) for the considered energy range between 1.65 and
2.4 eV. The substrate layer 1 is modeled with the refractive index
of glass (n1 = 1.5) and layer 3 (air above
the crystal) with a value of n3 = 1.0.
We assume only the real parts of these refractive indices, because
these layers are transparent in the relevant energy range. Important
parameters for the calculations are the energy-dependent complex refractive
index components of the crystal, which are the free parameters for
the fitting procedure below. Further crucial parameters are the height
of the 3TBT layer 2, which is set to 3.3 μm according to the
atomic force microscope measurement in Figure 2a, and the positions and orientations of
the radiating dipole ensembles in layer 2. Given the experimental
conditions with focused laser excitation entering the crystal from
the substrate medium, for horizontal (x direction)
polarizer axis, we use an x-oriented dipole ensemble
distributed exponentially from bottom to top (3.3 μm) with an
absorption coefficient of 0.3 μm–1 estimated
from our earlier study.39 The pattern obtained
with vertical (y direction) polarizer axis originates
from z-oriented dipole ensembles, which are distributed
homogeneously in a 120 nm layer on top of the 3TBT crystal (height
3130–3250 nm, 40 dipoles in total) and a single dipole in 10
nm height at the bottom of the crystal. Note again that z-oriented transition dipole moments stem very likely from nanofibers
on the surface (top and bottom) of the 3TBT crystals.

A fitting
routine is carried out that fits the calculated radiation
characteristics of the considered dipole ensemble to the experimental
data for each energy using the complex refractive index of the 3TBT
single crystal as free parameter (Figure 4b,c). For the x-oriented
dipole ensemble in the simulation, only the refractive index component
along the x direction is relevant and thus allows
for an independent fitting of ñ2x (Figure 4b). Similarly, the z-oriented dipole ensemble
allows for fitting of ñ2yz (Figure 4c).
In other words, the two independent fitting routines allow one to
determine two components of the refractive index of the crystal, namely ñ2x and an average value ñ2yz of ñ2y and ñ2z. The resulting real and imaginary parts
of ñ2x = n2x + in2x′ and ñ2yz = n2yz + in2yz′ are shown in Figure 5a,b, respectively. For energies above 2.3 eV (see dashed lines in Figure 5), the fitting becomes
inaccurate, because in this range, substrate mode peaks vanish. Their
position in k-space is the main criterion to fit
the real part of the refractive index. Moreover, in this range, the
signal decreases drastically, and the fitting becomes inaccurate due
to the decreasing signal-to-noise ratio.

Figure 5 Refractive index components
obtained from the simulations. (a)
Real parts of the crystal’s refractive index n2x for the x direction
and n2yz for an average
in the yz direction. (b) Imaginary parts of the same
refractive index components. Black lines represent smoothed values.

The real parts of both refractive
index components show a normal
dispersion with energy, which is clearly mapped in the interference
patterns as a bending of the maxima toward higher |ky| for increasing energy (cf. Figure 3c,d). Moreover, we
find a marked anisotropy due to the high degree of order in the crystal.
The fact that n2x is
bigger than n2yz is consistent
with the structure of 3TBT single crystals, with the backbones of
the 3TBT molecules being oriented along the x direction.
The real parts of the refractive indices are in the range of about
1.9−2.5, and are in good agreement with the values of thiophene-based
systems.33,42 The imaginary parts are very small for energies
below 2.2 eV, where no absorption of the crystal is expected. Possible
scattering of the propagating substrate modes, e.g., at interface
defects, also leads to an attenuation of the (multiple) reflected
lightwaves inside the crystal and thus results in a small imaginary
part of the refractive index in the simulation. For energies above
2.2 eV, the imaginary parts strongly increase. The x-component is strongest, which is consistent with the anisotropic
absorption behavior of the crystal (cf. Figure 1b). Moreover, the dichroic ratio of n2x′ versus n2yz′ is consistent with that of the absorption spectra in Figure 1b.

With these refractive
index components (smoothed in black), the
energy-momentum spectra, especially the dispersive characteristics
of the interference maxima, are reproduced very well (cf. Figure 3e,f). The blurring
of the pattern in the energy range above 2.2 eV is explained by the
increasing imaginary part of the refractive index, resulting in high
reabsorption losses of the emission. This prevents multiple reflections
of the emission along the crystal, and therefore no substrate/waveguide
modes can build up. Note that we weighted the simulated spectra by
ω3|μ(ω)|2, with the energy-dependent
transition dipole moment μ(ω) to account for the (distorted)
vibronic progression in the experimental data (see Calculation of Energy-Momentum Spectra, SI). Using the refractive
index component ñ2x derived here, we investigated two additional crystals of different
sizes. The simulations very nicely reproduce the experimentally obtained
energy-momentum patterns only by adjusting the height of the crystal
(see Figure S4, SI).

Characteristic
profiles of the quasi-discrete substrate modes are
shown in Figure 4b,c.
In the low-energy range (Figure 4b,c top), several peaks are observed whose full width
decreases strongly with increasing |ky|, i.e., radiation angles. In general, the full width
at half-maximum (fwhm) of a single propagating substrate mode in k-space is related to the propagation length lprop in real space by lprop = 1/(fwhm × k0).43 In the experiment, we measure fwhm ≈ 0.07 for the
substrate modes with ky/k0 ≈ −1.4 in Figure 4b,c (top). This yields
a propagation length of about 1.4 μm. However, from the emission
map in Figure 2c, we
calculate a propagation length of about 3.5 μm in the y direction (see Figure S5f,
SI). A detailed analysis reveals that the exact ky-value of the substrate mode depends
slightly on the emitter height. Thus, a single emitter defines the
minimum width of the substrate mode in k-space, whereas
an ensemble, which is distributed in height, results in the detection
of a broadened width in k-space (see Figure S5g–i, SI). By considering the
substrate modes of a single emitter, the corresponding propagation
lengths are (in average) very close to our experimental observation
(see table below Figure S5i, SI). This
behavior was verified for two other crystals of different heights
(see Figure S5d,e,g,h, SI). In the high-energy
range of the energy-momentum spectra, we do not observe any peaks
(Figure 4b,c bottom),
because the propagation lengths are very short due to reabsorption
losses and the signal-to-noise ratio drops down. Finally, we note
that the results presented here are reproduced by exclusively assuming
propagating substrate modes. Although exciton diffusion over significant
distances can occur in organic crystals,44 we thus conclude that this latter effect is not the predominant
mechanism in our system.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
shown that the smooth surfaces of solution-grown
single crystals from the organic oligomer 3TBT allow one to observe
self-interference of the crystal’s emission. We excite the
crystal with a diffraction-limited laser spot and bring different
pathways of the emitted light wave to interference in energy-momentum
space. We note that in our case, we do not have spatially separated
coherently radiating emitters, which would also give rise to interference
patterns.45,46 Also, standing wave electric currents radiating
from plasmonic nanorods into the far field have been shown to cause
interference patterns.47 In our case, it
is simply 3TBT emitters, confined between interfaces to different
optical materials, which give rise to a complex energy-dependent,
directional radiation pattern of the crystal. Using a simulation of
radiating electrical dipoles in a crystal layer, sandwiched by the
substrate and air, we can reproduce the experimentally obtained interference
patterns. The fitting allows one to retrieve the anisotropic and complex
energy-dependent refractive index components in the crystal (uniaxial
approximation), which is a crucial parameter for a detailed modeling
of light propagation. Our results are also of high importance for
all spectroscopic studies on micro- and nanostructured materials,
where real space spectroscopy typically averages over all directions
of emission. The emission spectrum of micrometer-sized films and crystals
can be distorted in the full energy range due to interferences (see Figure 3c). The strong dependency
of the emission spectra on direction is especially important in the
high-energy range. The relative strength of the highest energy peak
in the emission of π–π-stacked organic molecules,
such as the 3TBT molecules in a single-crystal arrangement, provides
important information about, e.g., the structural order within the
structure.40,41 We found angular-dependent emission
spectra even for very thin crystals of about 100 nm in diameter (see Figure S1, SI).

Experimental Section
Material
and Sample Preparation
3TBT is 100% regioregular
with a molecular weight M = 1492.32 g/mol and a contour
length of 3.6 nm. As reported recently, micrometer-sized 3TBT single
crystals are grown in solution at a relatively high crystallization
temperature (60 °C).5,39 Subsequently, 10 μL
of this solution is spin cast at 1000 rotations/min onto a cleaned
glass substrate, so that spatially well-separated single crystals
can be optically identified on the substrate. This preparation results
in a three-layer geometry of the sample: glass substrate, single crystal,
and air.

Optical Microscopy and Spectroscopy
The experiments
were performed using a home-built optical microscope.16,48 The excitation source was a pulsed diode laser (LDH-P-C-450B, Picoquant;
<60 ps pulse duration) operating at a center wavelength of 450
nm and at 20 MHz repetition rate. The sample is located in the focal
plane of an infinity-corrected high numerical aperture (NA) oil-immersion
objective (PlanApo, 60×, NA = 1.45, Olympus). This plan-corrected
apochromat is ideally suited for Fourier microscopy.49 The exciting laser light (polarization in the x direction, definition see Figure 2b) can be focused to a diffraction-limited spot with
a minimum full width at half-maximum of approximately 350 nm for confocal
excitation. By using an additional lens in front of the objective,
the sample is illuminated by a beam of about 70 μm in diameter
for widefield imaging. The emission is collected by the same objective
and passes a set of dielectric filters (dichroic beam splitter z460RDC,
long-pass filter LP467, AHF Analysentechnik) to suppress the laser
light. Afterward, the emission is split by a 30/70 beam splitter:
30% of the total intensity is directed to a CCD camera (Orca-ER, Hamamatsu)
for imaging and 70% to a spectrometer (SP2150i, Princeton Instruments;
150 grooves/mm, blaze wavelength 500 nm) equipped with a back-illuminated
electron-multiplying CCD camera (iXon DV887-BI, Andor Technology).

The back-focal-plane imaging is achieved by flipping in an additional
Bertrand lens into the detection path so that the back focal plane
of the objective is imaged onto the CCD camera. For energy-momentum
spectroscopy, the back focal plane is imaged onto the spectrometer’s
entrance slit. The slit acts as an aperture so that only emission
with kx ≈ 0 (definition
see Figure 3a,b) enters
the spectrometer. The emission is then dispersed according to its
wavelength (energy) and detected by the spectrometer CCD. Note that
prior to the measurements, the 3TBT crystals are aligned with their
long axis parallel to the entrance slit of the spectrometer by using
a pivoted sample mount. A polarizer (Spindler and Hoyer, Polarisationsfilter
80) is placed in the detection path for polarization-dependent measurements.

To measure the absorbance of a 3TBT single crystal, a white light
source (Halolux 150, Streppel Glasfaser-Optik) is used to illuminate
the sample from top. The transmitted light through the crystal Ic(E) is collected by the microscope
objective and detected through the spectrometer as a function of the
wavelength (or energy E). As a reference, the transmission
spectrum Iref(E) is detected
at a sample position without crystal. The absorbance is then calculated
according to OD(E) = −log10(Ic(E)/Iref(E)).
