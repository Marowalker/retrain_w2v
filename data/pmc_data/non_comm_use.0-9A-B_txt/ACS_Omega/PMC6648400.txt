Batteries based on multivalent ion
(such as Al3+, Ca2+, and Mg2+) intercalation
materials have attracted
extensive research interest due to their impressive capacity improvement
and cost reduction compared with Li-ion batteries. However, the materials
for state-of-the-art multivalent ion batteries still suffer from drawbacks
such as sluggish ion mobility, poor rate performance, and low cyclic
stability, bringing challenges for the design and investigation of
new materials. Layered cathode materials are widely applied in current
commercial batteries due to their outstanding ionic conductivity and
structural stability, which may also hold the key for the cathodes
of multivalent batteries. Therefore, combining database screening
and density functional theory computations, we evaluated the layered
compounds in Materials Project database by theoretical capacity, thermodynamic
stability, experimental availability, voltage, volume variation, electronic
conductivity, and ionic migration barrier and achieved over 20 kinds
of layered cathode materials for multivalent batteries. Through Mg
ion substitution for Ca sites, we further achieved several kinds of
cathode materials for Mg-ion batteries with ideal stability, voltage,
and ion diffusion barriers. We hope the methodology and screened materials
could promote the development of multivalent ion batteries.

Introduction
With the increasing
threat of the energy crisis and environment
deterioration caused by the consumption of fossil fuels, the utilization
of renewable and clean energy sources becomes a crucial challenge
in the 21st century. The most promising renewable energy sources,
such as wind, solar, hydroelectric, and geothermal energies, distribute
unevenly in time and space, which give rise to the demands for energy
storage devices with high energy density. However, the state-of-the-art
energy storage devices are still far from the requirement for large-scale
energy storage. Li-ion batteries (LIBs) have achieved extensive application
in portable electronic devices and electric vehicles due to their
decent energy density, rechargeability, and cycle life, while the
safety issue, limited energy density, and growing cost impede their
further applications in large-scale energy storage.1−3 Consequently,
the development of energy storage devices with high energy density
is of great significance in the solution of energy and environmental
problems.

The multivalent ion battery, composed of an intercalation
cathode
and a multivalent metal (such as Mg, Al, Ca, and Zn) anode, has shown
considerable potential for a higher energy density, better safety,
and much lower cost.4 Especially, the Mg
and Al anodes exhibit volumetric capacities of 3833 and 8046 mAh cm–3, respectively, which are far beyond those of Li (2062
mAh cm–3) and Na (1128 mAh cm–3).5−8 The significantly improved volumetric capacity could be attributed
to the multielectron redox reaction for every individual ion and the
higher densities of Mg and Al. Besides, the ionic radii of Mg2+ (0.86 Å) and Al3+ (0.53 Å) are smaller
than that of Li (0.9 Å), further increasing the energy density.
Moreover, the dendrite formation in Mg-ion batteries (MIBs) is less
serious than that in LIBs, and the metal anodes of Mg and Al are much
more stable than Li and Na when exposed in air or even in humid atmosphere,
greatly improving the safety and reliability.8 The abundance of the multivalent ions in the earth’s crust
is also much higher than Li, which ensures acceptable cost in large-scale
application. Consequently, Al-ion batteries (AIBs) and Mg-ion batteries
are regarded as a possible solution to the current problems of energy
density and safety of batteries. Though the ion insertion in AIB cathodes
is complicated due to the participation of anions, the Al3+ intercalation mechanism has also been explored,9,10 which
exhibits advantage over AlxCly– insertion without consuming the
electrolyte during the electrochemical process. Besides Mg and Al,
Ca-ion batteries (CIBs) also attract more and more research interest
due to its ideal reduction potential (only 170 mV above Li) and faster
reaction kinetics than Mg, which guarantee a higher energy density
and better performance at high rates.11

However, the superior energy density of a battery could not
be
realized by the anode alone, and the cathode is more crucial for the
performance of current multivalent batteries. At present, the cathode
materials for state-of-the-art multivalent batteries are still far
from applications due to the drawbacks such as sluggish ion mobility,
poor rate performance, and low cyclic stability. As successfully implemented
in LIBs, layered intercalation materials exhibit the advantages of
outstanding ionic conductivity and structural stability, which might
hold the key for multivalent battery cathodes.3,8,12 Consequently, layered materials are always
promising candidates for the multivalent battery cathode, and an impressive
progress has been achieved both theoretically and experimentally.
Compared with experiments, density functional theory (DFT) computations
are able to skip the costly and time-consuming preparation procedure
and directly provide the information about the electrochemical performance
of materials, which show a remarkable credibility and efficiency.
Notably, high-throughput computational material screening approaches
are capable to utilize the tremendous data generated by previous experimental
and computational studies, further improving the efficiency of materials
investigation and design.2,4,13−18 We have successfully employed the high-throughput computational
screening method to design novel electrode materials for sodium-ion
batteries and obtained a set of candidate materials.19 Herein, we further extend our screening method to design
cathode materials for multivalent batteries. In this work, by combining
DFT computations and database screening approaches, we evaluated more
than 50,000 inorganic compounds in Materials Project (MP) database
by theoretical capacity, thermodynamic stability, experimental availability,
voltage, volume variation, electronic conductivity, and ionic migration
barrier and proposed several cathode materials for multivalent batteries
with a promising electrochemical performance.20,21 Moreover, some new cathode materials for Mg-ion batteries with satisfactory
stability, voltage, and ion diffusion barriers were further achieved
by ion substitution.

Results and Discussion
The database
screening approach is introduced in the computational
part. During the screening process, the compounds that could not satisfy
our criteria were excluded stepwise. The remaining structure numbers
at each screening step are summarized in Figure 1 and Table S1.
For further comparison with single valent ions, we also screened Li-,
Na-, and K-containing compounds and collected the statistics under
the same criteria. Among all the criteria that we set, the characterization
of layered structures always rules out over 76% of the candidates
because the three-dimensional connected materials are the majority
in the database. As expected, a theoretical capacity of 120 mAh g–1 excluded more single valent metal-containing compounds
(35–52%) than the multivalent metal-containing compounds (6–14%),
indicating the higher capacity of multivalent batteries. For all the
metal elements, around 50% of the compounds could meet the criteria
of band gap of <2.5 eV. Na- and K-containing compounds show an
obviously lower proportion of alloys (lower than 12%) compared with
the rest (32–59%), which may be attributed to the high reactivities
of Na and K metals. Interestingly, the numbers of Li- and Mg-containing
compounds (13,943 and 9818, respectively) are much larger than those
of the rest (lower than 4900 for each metal element). But only lower
than 12% Mg- and Li-containing compounds could be found in Inorganic
Crystal Structure Database (ICSD), while for the remaining metal elements,
the proportion is greater than 38%, which demonstrates a large number
of theoretically predicted Mg-and Li-containing compounds in the MP
database.

Figure 1 Funnel charts of the remaining compound numbers after each screening
step.

After screening the MP database
with our criteria for band gap,
theoretical capacity, stability, nonalloy, and layered structure,
33 Al-, 80 Ca-, and 25 Mg-containing compounds were obtained. The
theoretical capacity and band gap distribution of these compounds
are shown in Figure 2. The distribution suggests that the theoretical capacity of Al-containing
compounds is the highest compared with the others, which could be
attributed to the higher valence of Al3+. Additionally,
the band gaps of the obtained Al-containing compounds are generally
lower than the rest, indicating their better electronic conductivity.
Because Mg2+ and Ca2+ belong to the same main
group and share the same charge numbers, the Mg- and Ca-containing
compounds show a similar distribution.

and band gap distribution of screened candidate
compounds.

Then, we examined their structural
and energy change upon the metal
ion deintercalation. In many LIB cathode materials, the metal ions
do not have to be completely extracted from the host, and the remaining
metal ions could protect the structure from serious variation during
the charge/discharge process, thus resulting in a better cyclability.
In that light, we checked the lattice parameter change and average
voltage by partially deintercalated structures, in which the metal
ions were deintercalated until the capacity exceeds 120 mAh g–1. In order to evaluate the structural maintenance,
we took the change lower than 15% as the criterion for each lattice
parameter, including the lattice constant a, b, or c, the angle α,
β, or γ, and the cell volume. Besides, the average voltage
could also be achieved by the energy difference between the pristine
and deintercalated structure. The criteria for the voltages of Al
(1.0–2.5 V), Ca (1.5–3.5 V), and Mg (1.5–3.5
V) ion deintercalation were set according to the reported common voltage
ranges.12 After screened by all the criteria
in Figure 4, the metal
ion diffusion barrier of obtained candidates were further calculated
by climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method. Their key features
as cathode materials are shown in Table 1, and their structures are plotted in Figure 3.

Two kinds
of MAX phase materials, AlV4C3 and
Ti4AlN3, were obtained as cathode materials
for AIBs. It has been reported that the monolayers of MAX phases,
also termed as MXene, have great potential as anode materials for
Li-, Na-, K-, Mg-, Ca-, and Al-ion batteries, but the application
of the bulk phase MAX materials in cathode materials has hitherto
rarely been studied.22,23 Compared with the MXene monolayer
anodes, an Al atom in MAX binds with two M4X3 layers rather than one. Therefore, the interaction is much stronger
than that in MXene anodes, and the voltage of these bulk phase MAX
materials is suitable for AIB cathode materials. Besides, the energy
barriers (0.92 and 0.93 eV) are also acceptable for Al ion diffusion;
thus, the thermodynamic and dynamic properties of these MAX phase
materials suggest their potential as cathode materials for AIBs. Three
kinds of Mg-containing candidate materials were achieved for MIBs.
Among them, the application of MgV2O5 as cathode
materials for MIBs has been extensively studied both theoretically
and experimentally, demonstrating the credibility of our method.24−27 For the rest two materials, the high ionic diffusion barriers might
lead to a poor electrochemical performance at high rates. Most of
our screening results are Ca-containing compounds. Although they all
possess considerable voltage and capacity, previous investigations
on those materials focused on the preparation, magnetism, electronic
properties, catalysis, etc.28−34 To the best of our knowledge, among those materials, only CaMn2O4 has been evaluated as a CIB cathode material.35 According to our results, the Ca ion diffusion
barriers in those materials are higher than 1 eV except for Ca3(GaN2)2. The large radii and multiple
charges seriously hinder the Ca ion migration in these hosts, which
limit the application to some extent. Note that the Al, Ca, and Mg
ions in these materials could be substituted by each other through
ion exchange or electrochemical processes.36−41 Because most of our obtained cathode materials are for CIBs, the
hosts for Ca ions might also be applied to AIBs and MIBs. Especially,
because Ca and Mg ions share the same valence and coordination number,
the Mg substitution at Ca sites would cause a less structural variation.
Besides, the smaller Mg ion could also reduce the energy barrier of
ion diffusion and exhibit a better rate performance. Based on this
consideration, we substituted Ca with Mg in all 16 kinds of obtained
CIB cathode materials and investigated their structural change. According
to the change in the space group and lattice parameters, we selected
eight well-maintained structures upon substitution, and further validated
their dynamical stability by ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). Figure S3 shows that all the compounds keep their
original structures after 10 ps at 600 K, suggesting their excellent
stability and experimental feasibility. Then, we calculated the voltage
and diffusion barriers (Table 2 and Figure S4). As shown in Table
2, the Mg substitution at Ca leads to a slight volume decrease due
to the smaller radius of Mg. Most of the obtained structures maintain
the same space group of their precursors, while Mg3Ru2O7 and MgV3O7 change to the
similar space group. Generally, the Mg substitution would cause a
voltage decrease of 0.4–0.9 V, but the values are still acceptable
for MIBs cathode except Mg(PRu)2. As expected, most of
the substituted structures show lower ion diffusion barriers. Especially,
the energy barriers of Mg2RuO4 (PBCA), Mg3Ru2O7, and Mg4Mn2O7 changed to 0.68, 0.71, and 0.58 eV, respectively, which
are pretty ideal values compared with current bulk MIB cathode materials.
Therefore, those compounds generated by substitution could serve as
promising MIB cathode materials. Additionally, the substitution of
Ca by other metal elements (such as Al and Zn) may also provide more
excellent cathode materials.

Conclusions
By
the combination of database screening and DFT computational
investigation, we screened the MP database and achieved 21 kinds of
novel cathode materials for Al-, Ca-, and Mg-ion batteries with proper
theoretical capacity, thermodynamic stability, experimental feasibility,
voltage, volume variation, electronic conductivity, and ionic migration
barrier. Then, we further substituted Ca in the obtained CIB cathode
materials by Mg and successfully obtained seven kinds of MIB cathode
materials with reduced ion diffusion barriers. Especially, the Mg
ion diffusion barriers in Mg2RuO4 (PBCA), Mg3Ru2O7, and Mg4Mn2O7 are 0.68, 0.71, and 0.58 eV, respectively, which are
satisfactory for current MIB cathode materials. We hope that our screening
method could be extended to explore more electrode materials for multivalent
batteries, and our achieved compounds could bring inspiration to the
development of Al-, Ca-, and Mg-ion batteries.

Computational Section
The flow diagram of our screening process based on the MP database
and our DFT computation is shown in Figure 4. We chose the compound
inherently containing only one of Al, Ca, and Mg element; thus, their
capability to serve as the host for multivalent ions is guaranteed.
For the convenience of computational studies, the compounds containing
lanthanide, actinide, and noble gas elements were excluded. Then,
we evaluated their stability by two criteria; the compounds must have
an energy above hull of <0.05 eV/atom and an ICSD ID. The energy
above hull of a compound is the energy difference between itself and
the most stable phase combination at this element ratio in the phase
diagram; therefore, a lower energy above hull suggests a better thermodynamic
stability. Besides, a compound with an ICSD ID means that it has been
included in the ICSD and experimentally realized accordingly.42,43 Afterwards, we examined their key features as layered cathode materials
and kept the compounds with band gaps of <2.5 eV and a theoretical
capacity of >120 mAh g–1. As usual, the theoretical
capacity was calculated under the assumption that all the cations
were extracted from the host. The compounds composed by all metal
elements (alloy) usually induce alloying during the ion extraction/intercalation
process; thus, we also excluded those composed of only metal elements
(including Si) from the candidates because we focused on intercalation
cathodes. Next, we selected the layered structures by a dimensional
classification algorithm, which has been proved credible and efficient.19,44 After that, we obtained a set of Mg/Al/Ca-containing layered compounds
with proper element composition, thermodynamic stability, theoretical
capacity, and electronic conductivity.

approach for multivalent cathode
materials.

DFT computations were performed
with Vienna ab initio simulation
package (VASP).45 We adopted the projector
augmented wave (PAW) method to describe the ion–electron interactions
and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional for
the exchange–correlation energy.45−47 An energy cutoff of
520 eV was chosen for the plane-wave basis set. Because the strong
electron correlation effects of some transitional metal element may
induce large errors in the voltage calculation, we used DFT+U method
with the U–J parameters in accordance with the MP database
(Table S2). The DFT-D3 method with Becke–Jonson
damping was applied to achieve a more accurate evaluation of the van
der Waals interactions.48,49 The Monkhorst-Pack
k-point mesh with a k-point separation lower than 0.03 Å–1 was used to sample the first Brillouin zone. The
average voltage (Vave) was calculated
by  where Ede is the
energy of the deintercalated structure, Em is the energy of each metal atom in the metal bulk phase, E0 is the energy of the structure before deintercalation, n is the extracted metal atom number, z is the valence of metal ions (+3 for Al and +2 for Mg/Ca), and F is the Faraday constant. The change in lattice parameters
(xchange, x could be
the lattice constant a, b, or c, the angle α, β, or γ,
and the cell volume) could be defined as  where xde represents
the lattice parameters of the deintercalated structure, and x0 is the lattice parameters of the original
structure. The metal ion diffusion pathways and energy profiles were
calculated by the CI-NEB method.50 We adopted
10 ps AIMD at 600 K to evaluate the dynamical stability and chose
a canonical (NVT) ensemble, Nosé–Hoover thermostat,
and a time step of 2 fs.
