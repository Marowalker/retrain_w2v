Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate),
a green polymer originating from prokaryotic
microbes, has been used to prepare composites with graphene nanoplatelets
(GnP) at different concentrations. The films were fabricated by drop-casting
and were hot-pressed at a temperature lower than their melting point
to provide the molecular chains enough energy to reorientate while
avoiding melting and degradation. It was found that hot-pressing increases
crystallinity and improves mechanical properties. The Young’s
modulus increased from 1.2 to 1.6 GPa for the poly(3-hydroxybutyrate)
(P(3HB)) films and from 0.5 to 2.2 GPa for the 15 wt % P(3HB)/GnP
composites. Electrical resistivity decreases enormously with GnP concentration
and hot-pressing, reaching 6 Ω sq–1 for the
hot-pressed 30 wt % P(3HB)/GnP composite. Finally, the hot-pressed
P(3HB) samples exhibit remarkable oxygen barrier properties, with
oxygen permeability reaching 2800 mL μm m–2 day–1, which becomes 895 mL μm m–2 day–1 when 15% GnP is added to the biopolymer
matrix, one of the lowest values known for biopolymers and biocomposites.
We propose that these biocomposites are used for elastic packaging
and electronics.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The excessive use of plastics since the middle of the 20th century,
in almost all sectors of everyday life, has resulted in enormous environmental
pollution that now alarms scientists and society. Since 1964, plastic
production has increased 20-fold, and it is expected to double again
in 20 years and almost quadrupled by 2050 (World Economic Forum).
In particular, in 2017, global plastic production reached 320 million
tonnes, while the bioplastic production was only 2.05 million tonnes,
about ∼1% of the plastics market.1 Plastics are mainly derived from petroleum, the vast majority of
these are not biodegradable, and the consequences of their extensive
use include water pollution, bioaccumulation, and greenhouse effects.2,3 Hence, the effort to substitute petroleum-based plastics with bioplastics,
that come from natural resources and are biodegradable, has increased
enormously in the last few years.4−6

A class of biomaterials
that have attracted a lot of attention
are the bio-based polyesters, namely polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA).7,8 PHAs are bioplastics produced completely by microorganisms,9,10 and they are among the most versatile biodegradable polymers with
properties very close to petroleum-based plastics.11 The physical properties of PHAs, such as mechanical (i.e.,
Young’s modulus), thermal (i.e., melting point), and their
chemical properties, such as solvent solubility, largely depend on
the microbial strain, the carbon source, and the method of extraction.7,12 PHAs are categorized as medium-chain and short-chain length PHA,
based on the number of carbon atoms in their monomer units, ranging
from 4 to 14.13 Recently, long-chain PHAs
have also been reported with more than 14 carbon atoms in their monomer
units.14 One of the most commonly used
PHA is poly(3-hydroxybutyrate), P(3HB), a short-chain length PHA containing
4 carbon atoms in its monomer unit. P(3HB) is a highly crystalline
thermoplastic with high melting temperatures of 172–180 °C,
that is stiff and brittle.15,16 It has a Young’s
modulus of 3.5–4.0 GPa and an elongation at break less than
5%. Due to its biocompatibility and biodegradability, P(3HB) is also
considered as a promising bioplastic in biomedical applications10,17−21 and the packaging industry.22−24

To meliorate the properties
of P(3HB), different fillers have been
added into the polymer matrix, like bioglass and hydroxyapatite.15,25−29 As seen in these reports, there is an inherent porosity in the P(3HB)
films, which leads to a dependence on the mechanical properties of
the composite on the size of the filler.26 More specifically, while the stiffness of the matrix increases for
fillers in the nanoscale size, the inverse occurs in the case of microsized
fillers, allowing the possibility to tailor stiffness according to
the application.

Graphene nanoplatelets (GnP) have been extensively
used as reinforcing
fillers in polymer matrices. They possess identical surface chemistry
with carbon nanotubes, but they have a planar geometry, combining
the laminar properties of layered silicates with the physical properties
of graphene.30 Hence, due to their special
electrical and mechanical properties, lubricating planar surfaces,
and flexibility, they are considered ideal for tailoring the properties
of polymer matrices.31,32 We thus consider GnP as an interesting
filler for the P(3HB) polymer matrix, not only to enhance the mechanical
properties of the matrix but, in addition, to convey electrical properties
to an otherwise insulating material.

Good dispersion and interfacial
interactions of the fillers in
a polymer matrix are the main important parameters that need to be
fulfilled when fillers are used as reinforcing agents in polymers.
GnP have a poor affinity with most polymers, due to the inert chemical
character of their surfaces, and their homogeneous distribution in
the polymer matrices is still a challenge. The improvement in the
dispersion of GnP in polymers has been addressed by different methods,
like filler functionalization prior to mixing33 or in situ polymerization in the presence of carbon nanotubes.34 The aforementioned techniques are able to improve
composite quality; however, they introduce time-consuming steps and/or
highly specialized chemical procedures. Recently, uniaxial hot-pressing,
as a post-treatment, has been used to improve composite performance,
with respect to both electrical conductivity35,36 and mechanical properties.37 The enhanced
performance is caused by the densification and alignment of the fillers.
However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no previous study
on the effect of hot-pressing on PHA composites.

In this work,
we report for the first time, the effects of hot-pressing
on the crystallinity, oxygen barrier, and the electrical and mechanical
properties of P(3HB). P(3HB)-based films were produced by solution
processing through simple casting, starting from P(3HB) solutions
with or without the addition of GnP. Solution processing is a versatile
method of polymer processing that can result in different polymer
morphologies, like films38,39 or fibers.40,41 Solution processing for thin-film fabrication can be easily scaled
up, using techniques for mass production like tape-casting and doctor
blading.42 After casting and solvent evaporation,
the developed films were hot-pressed at a temperature slightly lower
than the melting temperature of P(3HB), which increases the mobility
of the polymer chains without degrading the polymer. Degradation is
a common problem of thermally treated biopolyesters that undergo thermal
processing methods, like extrusion or melt injection.43 The crystallinity of the films was enhanced after hot-pressing,
as measured using X-ray diffraction (XRD). In addition, mechanical
properties were studied, and their behavior is discussed both as a
result of GnP loading and hot-pressing, with the hot-pressed samples
showing superior mechanical properties, since they were more elastic,
regaining their original shape even after folding. Finally, the P(3HB)
films were studied as potential candidates for two different applications,
elastic packaging and electronics. For the packaging, the essential
properties of the oxygen barrier were studied, and it was found that
hot-pressing decreased the oxygen permeability (OP) of P(3HB) by more
than 90%, making P(3HB) a very promising material for this specific
application. Next, the electrical conductivity of the composites was
studied with the increasing GnP concentration. For high GnP concentration
and hot-pressing, the sheet resistance attained an unprecedented low
value of 6 Ω sq–1, making P(3HB) a highly
valuable candidate for green flexible electronics.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 P(3HB) Extraction and Characterization
P(3HB) was produced by Bacillus subtilis OK2, using glucose as the carbon source, via batch fermentation,
as shown in Figure 1A. The amount of biomass obtained at the end of fermentation was
around 0.82 g L–1. The final P(3HB) concentration
was 0.24 g L–1. The P(3HB) yield was 30% dry cell
weight (dcw). As shown in Figure 1B, the monomeric composition of P(3HB) was confirmed
using gas chromatography. The peak at 6.25 min represents the internal
standard (methyl benzoate). The fragment peak at a retention time
of 4.125 min represents butyric acid 3-hydroxy methyl ester, which
confirmed that the polymer produced was indeed P(3HB).

(GC–MS) spectra of P(3HB), (C) 1H and (D) 13C NMR spectra of P(3HB).

Further structural characterization of the P(3HB) produced was
carried out using NMR, as shown in Figure 1C for 1H and Figure 1D for 13C.

Analysis of the 1H and 13C NMR spectra is
in agreement with the GC–MS spectra, hence confirming that
the polymer produced by B. subtilis OK2 with glucose as the carbon source is P(3HB), as also identified
by GC–MS. In addition to the chemical and structural properties,
the thermal properties of P(3HB) were analyzed using differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Figure S1a).

2.2 Morphology of P(3HB)/GnP Composites
Figure 2a depicts
the different steps of the fabrication method, which are described
analytically in the Experimental Section.
In brief, homogeneous dispersions of GnP at different concentrations
in chloroform/P(3HB) solutions were drop-cast in glass Petri dishes.
After solvent evaporation, very uniform, free-standing films were
obtained, which were used either as prepared, or were subsequently
hot-pressed. Representative scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images
of P(3HB) and P(3HB)/10% GnP depict the surface and the cross-section
of the respective samples. The surface of pure P(3HB) films present
the typical rough and slightly porous structure of these types of
polymers,26 which are also seen in the
cross-section, as shown in Figure 2b,c, respectively. When GnP are added in the P(3HB)
matrix, the surface attains a similar porous morphology, and the GnP
do not seem to be exposed on the surface of the polymer, as seen in Figure 2d. The cross-section
of the P(3HB)/GnP sample, shown in Figure 2e, presents a dense P(3HB) matrix, with the
GnP distributed quite homogeneously within it. Finally, after hot-pressing,
the porous structure totally disappears, as seen in Figure 2f for P(3HB)/10% GnP, while
the GnP are compacted and oriented parallel to the basal plane, in
a brick-mortar-like structure (Figure 2g).

2.3 Crystallographic Investigation and Raman Studies
In Figure 3a, the
XRD pattern of pure P(3HB), measured in the transmission mode, exhibits
two intense peaks at 13.4 and 16.9° assigned to the (020) and
(110) planes of the orthorhombic unit cell. Two more distinct peaks
appear at 25.5 and 27.1° and are assigned to the (130) and (040)
planes. In addition, the band at ∼22° is due to the broadening
of the peaks corresponding to the (101) and (111) planes. Using the
diffractograms presented in Figure 3a, the crystal structure of the P(3HB) films was simulated
using the crystallographic software Mercury CSD 3.9 from CCDC (Cambridge
Crystallographic Data Center) and shows the characteristic helical
chain conformation (α-form, shown in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information (SI)).

Figure 3 (a) XRD in the transmission
mode of the P(3HB)/GnP composites,
before (line) and after (dotted line) hot-pressing, (b) μRaman
spectra for the P(3HB)/GnP composites before (solid line) and after
(dotted line) hot-pressing. The asterisk (*) indicates the split band
at 1445/1457 cm–1.

When GnP are added into the P(3HB) matrix, a new peak appears at
approximately 26.55°, which corresponds to the (002) peak of
graphite (ICSD collection code 76767), and therefore comes from the
embedded GnP. The intensity of this peak increases as the concentration
of GnP in the P(3HB) matrix increases, as expected.

Following
hot-pressing, the XRD characterization was performed
again in all of the samples. Comparing the diffractograms of the pristine
and the hot-pressed P(3HB) samples, it is evident that the hot-pressed
films are more crystalline: the (020) and (110) peaks are considerably
narrow, for example, the full width at half-maximum of the (020) peak
decreases from ca. 0.33 for pristine samples to ca. 0.23 for the hot-pressed
ones. Furthermore, the broad band that was centered at ∼22°,
splits into two distinct peaks at 21.5 and 22.6°, assigned to
(101) and (111) planes of the orthorhombic unit cell. Finally, after
hot-pressing, a well-defined peak appears at ∼20.1°, due
to the presence of a small amount of β form crystals.45 The β form of P(3HB) is related to the
presence of a high level of molecular stretching in the amorphous
region between the α-crystalline lamellae.46

For the composite samples, the GnP peak at 26.55°
is greatly
suppressed in the hot-pressed film, implying the increased orientation
of the GnP basal planes along the plane of the film, i.e., perpendicular
to the beam. Due to the transmission geometry of the beam in XRD,
any planes perpendicular to the beam are not expected to give diffraction
peaks. This is corroborated by the SEM images, as shown in Figure 2g, where the planar
orientation of the GnP is evident. DSC measurements of the pristine
and the hot-pressed P(3HB) films (Figure S1b in the SI) support the finding of higher crystallinity after hot-pressing
and show an increase in the melting temperature of P(3HB) by approximately
20 °C. It is interesting to note here that, after hot-pressing,
the P(3HB) films are no longer able to dissolve in chloroform, unlike
the pristine ones. This might be due to the increase in crystallinity.47,48

Micro-Raman is a powerful, nondestructive characterization
technique
that has been extensively used to study both P(3HB) and graphene.
Here, pure P(3HB) films and composites were studied by μRaman
spectroscopy, both before and after hot-pressing, and the results
are shown in Figure 3b. In the case of the samples before hot-pressing, the Raman spectrum
of pure P(3HB) exhibits the main vibrational modes at 840, 1060, 1223,
1264, 1726 cm–1, a split band at 1445/1457 cm–1, and several peaks within the region 2800–3100
cm–1.49 The 840 cm–1 peak is assigned to C-COO stretching, and the 1060
cm–1 peak to C-CH3 stretching, of the
polymer backbone. The vibrational modes at 1223 and 1264 cm–1 are characteristic modes of the helical structure of crystalline
P(3HB). Band splitting, like the one at 1445/1457 cm–1, has been observed to occur in polymers with helical structures
due to intermolecular interactions.49,50 The modes
seen between 2800 and 3100 cm–1 are due to C–H
stretching from the methyl, methylene, and methene groups. Finally,
the vibrational mode at 1726 cm–1 comes from the
C=O stretching. In the case of the P(3HB)/GnP composites, the
fingerprint peaks of GnP appear at approximately 1340 cm–1 (D peak), 1582 cm–1 (G peak), and 2686 cm–1 (2D peak). From the shape of the 2D peak, we can
conclude that the GnP in the composite form multilayer stacks (∼5
layers).51

The band at 1726 cm–1 is of particular interest
because its deconvolution (seen in Figure S3 in the SI) reveals the presence of three peaks, at approximately
1726, 1733, and 1744 cm–1. The first two peaks are
due to the crystalline phase of P(3HB), while the third one indicates
the amorphous phase. By deconvoluting the ν(C=O) band
to the 3 aforementioned peaks, for both P(3HB) and P(3HB) + 10 wt
% GnP (Figure S3, in the SI), it is seen
that in the presence of GnP, the peak assigned to the amorphous phase,
at 1744 cm–1, is highly suppressed, while the peak
assigned to the crystalline phase, at 1726 cm–1,
increases in intensity. The ratio of the areas of the two peaks, A1726/A1744, is used
to quantify the crystallinity of the samples. Indeed, this ratio increases
with the addition of 10 wt % GnP, from 0.26 for pure P(3HB) to 2.79
for the P(3HB)/GnP composite (see Table 1 in the SI), indicating that the GnP result in an increase in the
crystallinity of P(3HB), in agreement with previous studies.39

After hot-pressing, μRaman measurements
were repeated, resulting
in similar spectra as for the unpressed samples, as shown in Figure 3b. Here, the absence
of a vibrational mode at 1658 cm–1, which is a peak
associated with the degradation of P(3HB),49 indicates that there is no degradation taking place during the hot-pressing
under the specific conditions used in this work. In addition, the
change of the relative intensity of the band at 1445/1457 cm–1 (Figure S4 in the SI) indicates changes
in the crystallinity of the polymer,49 in
agreement with the XRD and DSC analyses. Finally, the deconvolution
of the ν(C=O) band, reveals a suppressed 1744 cm–1 peak, and increased A1726/A1744 ratio, due to the enhanced crystallinity
after hot-pressing, for both pure P(3HB) and the P(3HB)/GnP composite
(see Table 1 in the SI).

2.4 Mechanical Properties
The macroscopic
appearance of the pristine and hot-pressed P(3HB)/GnP composites is
shown in Figure 4a,b,
where it can be seen that they are flexible enough to sustain folding,
even at 180°. Nevertheless, the ductile character of the samples
is enhanced after hot-pressing, since in this case, the samples can
undergo multiple folding and unfolding, without any deformation and
without the formation of cracks.

Figure 4 Photographs of folded P(3HB) composite
films with 15 wt % GnP (a)
pristine and (b) hot-pressed, (c) Young’s modulus, and (d)
ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of the nanocomposites as a function
of the weight fraction of the GnP for pristine (black squares) and
hot-pressed (red circles) films.

From the resulting stress–strain curves (shown in Figure S5 in the SI), as measured by static mechanical
tests, the Young’s modulus, ultimate tensile strength (UTS),
and elongation at break were calculated and shown in Figure 4c,d. For the films before hot-pressing,
embedding GnP results in a general reduction in the mechanical parameters.
In particular, the Young’s modulus of pure P(3HB) is ca. 1.2
GPa, in agreement with other reports,25,26 decrease to
ca. 0.5 GPa for 15 wt % GnP, resulting in a reduction of about 55%.
Likewise, the UTS also suffers from a reduction of approximately 60%
when 15 wt % of GnP is added to the P(3HB) matrix (Figure 4d). Finally, elongation at
break (results not shown) decreases from 10 to 3% upon the addition
of 15% GnP. Such a general reduction of the mechanical properties
suggests a weak interaction between the polymer matrix and the reinforcing
filler so that the particles do not participate in the load-bearing
function. Instead, the filler particles act more like hollow zones
within the matrix that can be starting points of failure upon stress.
Consequently, both the stiffness and the strength are governed by
the reduced matrix.

On the other hand, hot-pressing of the films
results in enhanced
stiffness of the P(3HB) matrix. The Young’s modulus of the
P(3HB) film increased from 1.2 to 1.6 GPa after hot-pressing, and
it increases further with increasing GnP concentration reaching 2.2
GPa for 15 wt % GnP. This enhancement of the stiffness of approximately
40%, after hot-pressing, has also been observed for other polyester
matrices, like polylactic acid (PLA),37 and is attributed to the reorientation of the polymer chains during
hot-pressing, at temperatures higher than the melting temperature.
However, in the present case, hot-pressing was performed at a temperature
lower than the melting point of the P(3HB) matrix, and therefore we
expect less chain mobility and reorientation of the polymer chains.
In addition, the elimination of the porosity that is present in the
pristine films, as seen in Figure 2, helps to further enhance the stiffness of the films.
Eliminating the porosity most likely also results in a better physical
contact between the GnP and the matrix, improving the load transfer
from the matrix, thus leading to a higher Young’s modulus in
all composites. This is also supported by the increase of the UTS
after hot-pressing. In addition, it is known that the stiffness enhancement
can be achieved by aligning the 2D fillers.37 Indeed, as shown in the SEM picture of the hot-pressed composite
in Figure 2g, a brick-and-mortar
structure of the GnP is formed after hot-pressing. Furthermore, this
result is supported by XRD, where the GnP peak is greatly reduced
after hot-pressing, due to the parallel orientation of the GnP.

Furthermore, for low GnP concentrations, the presence of GnP can
create spots of intensified stress, which can induce the onset of
cracks, resulting in early fracture. For the GnP concentration higher
than 5%, the percolation threshold appears (also discussed in paragraph
3.5) and the GnP form continuous chains, shunting the stress from
the polymer matrix, and the Young’s modulus follows an almost
linear increase52 while UTS stabilizes
at a constant value. At the same time, the UTS decreases with the
increasing GnP concentration, even after hot-pressing, especially
for low GnP concentrations. At low GnP concentrations, GnP are not
continuous even after hot-pressing; hence, at large deformation, they
lose the capability to bear the load, while the stress reaches the
failure value within the matrix.

Finally, although elongation
at break decreases from ca. 10% to
ca. 3% with GnP addition, and this behavior does not alter after hot-pressing,
however, the films remain flexible enough after hot-pressing, as shown
in Figure 4b, and they
can be easily handled, facilitating their use in all possible applications.

2.5 Electrical Properties
Electronic
waste is becoming an increasing menace in our current times. As the
lifetime of electronic devices is getting shorter every year, electronic
waste reached 44.7 million tons in 2016 (United Nations), posing a
growing danger for the environment. This problem is addressed by the
emerging area of research of biomaterials that can be used in electronics,
where the tendency is to substitute rigid materials with organic,
flexible, and biodegradable polymers.53 To the best of our knowledge, there is only one study that proposes
P(3HB) as a conductive material when reinforced with carbon nanotubes.54 Here, we have studied for the first time the
electrical properties of the P(3HB) composites as a function of GnP
concentration, and the results are presented in Figure 5. Even though P(3HB) is an insulator, with
a sheet resistance of > 1010 Ω sq–1, when GnP are added in the matrix, the resistance becomes lower,
exhibiting an abrupt decrease from 1010 to 105 Ω sq–1, at ∼7 wt % GnP, in agreement
with the literature.39,55 For GnP concentration higher
than 15 wt %, the resistance saturates at approximately 150 Ω
sq–1.

Figure 5 Sheet resistance (left-hand Y-axis) and electrical
conductivity (right-hand Y-axis) as a function of
GnP concentration, for composites both prior (closed symbols) and
after hot-pressing (open symbols) (standard deviation shown in Figure S6).

The hot-pressed samples exhibit the same behavior, but their sheet
resistance attains lower values than the pristine samples. The percolation
threshold is the same for both pristine and hot-pressed samples, at
∼7 wt % GnP, where the resistivity is 5 orders of magnitude
lower than that of pure P(3HB). However, at 5 wt % GnP, the sheet
resistance of the hot-pressed samples is half an order of magnitude
lower (1 × 1010 Ω sq–1 for
unpressed sample, versus 5 × 109 Ω sq–1 for the hot-pressed sample), while this difference augments with
the increasing GnP concentration. For the GnP content higher than
15 wt %, the sheet resistance is lower than 20 Ω sq–1, reaching approximately 6 Ω sq–1 for 30
wt % GnP, a value that was also measured in films of pure GnP.55 On the right axis of Figure 5, the electrical conductivity is shown, as
calculated from the sheet resistance. The excellent electrical properties
of the composite are an added value, opening up possibilities for
the use of 100% biodegradable and biocompatible materials in green
and flexible electronics, to name a few applications. It is interesting
to note here that the percolation threshold implies a continuous GnP
network that shunts the weight load from the polymer matrix resulting
in changes in the mechanical properties, as discussed in paragraph
3.4.

2.6 Oxygen Barrier Properties
Packaging
is the largest application of plastics, representing 26% of their
total volume and about half of this is related to food.56 Hence, the necessity for green and biodegradable
materials that can be used in packaging is increasing with the increase
in the use of plastics.

PHAs have been investigated as a possible
candidate for packaging applications57,58 as a green
alternative to more commonly used plastics, like the natural polylactic
acid,59 or the synthetic low-density polyethylene
(LDPE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Here, we have investigated
the oxygen permeability (OP) of P(3HB), before and after hot-pressing,
as calculated from the oxygen transmission rate (OTR) and the results
are presented in Figure 6.

Figure 6 (a) Oxygen permeability values for pristine and hot-pressed P(3HB)
films for GnP concentrations 0–15 wt %, (b) schematic representation
of the action of GnP to the oxygen permeability in pristine and hot-pressed
composites, and (c) simplified schematic representation of oxygen
permeability for P(3HB) films (top panel), composites (middle panel),
and hot-pressed samples (bottom panel).

As we see in Figure 6a, the OP of pristine P(3HB) is ca. 40 000 mL μm m–2 day–1, and it decreases remarkably
to a value as low as 2800 mL μm m–2 day–1, after hot-pressing. This significant decrease (93%)
of OP can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the collapse
of the inherent porosity of the P(3HB) films and the increase of the
P(3HB) crystallinity during hot-pressing, as demonstrated by X-ray
diffraction and μRaman analysis. This induces higher tortuosity
in the trajectory of the oxygen molecules, which inevitably reduces
the oxygen permeability of the film.

Furthermore, polymer/GnP
composites have been proposed not only
for food packaging60,61 but depending on their electrical
properties, also for antistatic packaging for electronics.62,63 However, data on oxygen barrier properties are scarce in the literature.64−66 Here, we have investigated the oxygen permeability behavior of the
P(3HB)/GnP composites, also shown in Figure 6a. When GnP are added to the P(3HB) matrix,
the oxygen permeability of the films suffers a significant reduction.
Even 5 wt % addition of the GnP results in an OP of approximately
5300 mL μm m–2 day–1 (87%
reduction), while for 15% GnP, the OP decreases further to 3800 mL
μm m–2 day–1 (91% reduction).
Hot-pressing results in even lower OP values, due to the increased
crystallinity of the films and the loss of internal porosity, as explained
above, obtaining a value as low as 895 mL μm m–2 day–1 for 15 wt % GnP. The inclusion of GnP in
the P(3HB) matrix also results in higher tortuosity in the path of
the oxygen molecules, which further increases by their alignment and
compaction during hot-pressing, as shown schematically in Figure 6b.

It is interesting
to compare these OP results with those obtained
for other polymers currently used in food packaging applications,
such as PLA, LDPE, and PET. The hot-pressed P(3HB) films exhibit lower
oxygen permeability values than those obtained for LDPE (ca. 160 000
mL μm m–2 day–1), and for
PET (ca. 3000 mL μm m–2 day–1).67 Furthermore, the oxygen permeability
values we obtain here are lower than the ones obtained for the copolymer
poly-(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate), or
PHBV.58 For the PHBV samples, oxygen permeability
values were found to decrease for the lower 3-hydroxyvalerate content
attaining a value of 8160 mL μm m–2 day–1 for 7 wt % 3-hydroxyvalerate concentration, decreasing
further to 2590 mL μm m–2 day–1 with the addition of bacterial cellulose nanowhiskers. Even though
the OP of pure PHBV is lower than the one we found for pristine P(3HB),
the OP value we obtain after hot-pressing is much lower. Here, we
should also note that although the reduction percentage after hot-pressing
is similar for all composites, when we compare the composite films
to the pristine P(3HB) one, the reduction in oxygen permeability reaches
98% (15 wt % GnP, hot-pressed sample), one of the highest reductions
we know for graphene composites with polymers.68 In Figure 6c, we show a simplified scheme to hypothesize the mechanism of reduction
of OP in our samples, compared to the pristine P(3HB) films (upper
panel). First, the inclusion of GnP results in the lower OP (middle
panel), while hot-pressing further decreases the OP. These results
indicate that the P(3HB) is indeed a very promising candidate for
packaging applications, where a high barrier to oxygen is critical
to avoid or reduce the oxidative degradation processes. Its oxygen
permeability can be tuned, either by hot-pressing and/or with the
inclusion of GnP, over a very broad range of values.

3 Conclusions
Biocomposites of P(3HB) and GnP were fabricated
by a simple drop-cast
method and were studied for their physical properties. Furthermore,
the films were subjected to uniaxial hot-pressing, and their properties
were compared to the pristine ones. The GnP disperse well in the P(3HB)
matrix, and subsequent hot-pressing resulted in the collapse of the
inherent porosity of P(3HB) films, while the GnP aligned parallel
to the basal plane of the film, in a brick-and-mortar-like structure.
In addition, after hot-pressing, the crystallinity of the films increased,
as shown by XRD and μRaman measurements, while the improved
interaction between the polymer matrix and the filler was reflected
in the enhanced Young’s modulus of the films with increasing
GnP concentrations. A detailed study of the electrical properties
showed the dependence of electrical conductivity of the P(3HB) films
on the GnP concentration. As expected, the conductivity of the composites
increased with the increasing GnP concentration, reaching approximately
100 S m–1. In addition, after hot-pressing, even
though there was no clear shift of the percolation threshold, a clear
increase of the electrical conductivity was observed, which was attributed
to the collapse of the inherent porosity and the improved interaction
of the GnP with the P(3HB) matrix, with conductivity reaching a value
as high as 1000 S m–1. Finally, pure P(3HB) films
were tested for oxygen barrier properties, and it was seen that oxygen
permeability of the P(3HB) pristine film was improved by the inclusion
of GnP fillers. Subsequent hot-pressing lead to an impressive decrease
of the oxygen permeability of P(3HB) composite films by ca. 98%, making
it one of the most promising biomaterials for oxygen barrier applications
and packaging.

The fabrication method presented herein is a
standard solution
casting method adapted for small scale laboratory thin-film production.
This process gives homogeneous films, but it is not suitable for films
with a diameter bigger than 20–30 cm, and in addition, drying
times can be too long. However, it is shown that solution processing
can be scaled up using doctor blade or tape-casting techniques, producing
large, uniform, composite films in just a few hours.42

We believe that the results presented here reveal,
for the first
time, the highly desirable properties of P(3HB)/GnP composites, especially
the tuning of the electrical conductivity and the oxygen permeability.
The aforementioned obtained properties combined with the possibility
of the large scale production of the composite films through solution
processing techniques, like doctor blading and subsequent hot-press,
open completely new possibilities for the use of P(3HB), in two highly
relevant and environmentally crucial technological fields, namely,
packaging and green electronics.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Production and Extraction of SCL-PHA, Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate),
P(3HB)
P(3HB) was produced by B. subtilis OK2 using glucose at a concentration of 35 g L–1 as the sole carbon substrate and under nitrogen limiting conditions.
Bacterial fermentation was initiated by inoculating a sterile nutrient
broth with a single colony of B. subtilis OK2. This was incubated for 16 h at 30 °C, 200 rpm. Ten percent
(v/v) of the inoculum was used to inoculate the production stage (modified
Kannan and Rehacek media), which was incubated at 30 °C, 200
rpm for 48 h. The temperature was controlled at 30 °C, the pH
was set at 6.8, and 1 vvm air was supplied to the bioreactor. The
pH and DOT were monitored throughout the course of the fermentation
but not maintained. At the end of the fermentation, the biomass was
obtained via centrifugation. The wet biomass was subjected to repeated
washings with deionized water and homogenized (10 min in T25 basic
homogenizer, IKA Labortechnik) to induce outer cell membrane disruption.
The homogenized biomass was lyophilized in the preparation for polymer
extraction.

PHA was extracted from the biomass using an optimized
two-stage Soxhlet extraction method. Powdered biomass was added to
the thimble, which was placed in the extractor. The cells were refluxed
in methanol for 24–48 h to remove methanol soluble impurities,
followed by chloroform for 48 h to extract the polymer. The polymer
was precipitated in ice-cold methanol while stirring. The polymer
mass fraction (% dcw) was calculated as a percentage of the cell dry
mass.

4.2 Gas Chromatography (GC)
Chemical
characterization of the polymer was carried out using GC. Prior to
GC analysis, polymer samples were methanolyzed. GC–MS analysis
was carried out using a Varian GS system consisting of Chrompack CP-3800
gas chromatograph and the Saturn 200 MS/MS block.

4.3 NMR
Structural identification of
the polymer was carried out using 13C and 1H
NMR spectroscopy. Twenty milligrams of the purified polymer sample
were dissolved in 1 mL of deuterated chloroform (CDCl3)
and analyzed. All NMR spectra were measured at 298 K. Solution 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker
NMR spectrometer. Data acquisition and processing were performed using
standard Bruker TopSpin (version 2.1) software. 1H and 13C chemical shifts were calibrated using the residual solvent
peak (1H 7.26 ppm, 13C 77.15 ppm) for chloroform.

4.4 Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
Thermal properties such as the melting temperature (Tm), glass transition temperature (Tg), and the crystallization temperature (Tc) of the PHA produced were determined using DSC. Five
milligrams of the polymer sample were used for this analysis. Samples
were heated, cooled, and then reheated between −50 and 100
°C at a heating rate of 20 °C min–1. (ca.
−5 °C) to assure the mobility to the polymer chains.25

4.5 Film Preparation
GnP (grade Ultra-G+)
were provided by Directa Plus Spa (Italy). Their lateral dimension
is a few tens of micrometers, while the thickness is a few tens of
nanometers.37 Chloroform was acquired from
Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. To prepare the solutions for solvent
cast films, P(3HB) was dissolved in chloroform at a 5 wt % concentration.
After dissolution, GnP were added at concentrations ranging from 0
to 30 wt %. The solution was rendered homogeneous by bath sonication
for 7 h at 59 Hz. Subsequently, the solutions were drop-cast on glass
Petri dishes and covered to slow down the evaporation. The resulting
films were free-standing and had a thickness of approximately 200 μm.

For the hot-pressed samples, the samples were pressed uniaxially
(15 bar) for 30 min at a temperature of 150 °C. This temperature
is lower than the melting temperature of P(3HB) (ca. 172 °C)
and thus it is not expected to melt the samples, but higher than its
glass transition temperature (<10 °C). During hot-pressing,
the samples were placed between nonstick Teflon films (Advent Research
Materials, Art. Num. FP823338) to prevent their sticking to the surfaces
of the press. The hot-pressing was performed using a Specac-Atlas
15T Manual Hydraulic press. Film preparation and hot-pressing were
carried out at ambient conditions.

4.6 Characterization
of the Films
The
morphology of the surface and the cross-section of the films were
studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-6490LA).

X-ray diffraction measurements in a transmission geometry (TXRD)
were performed using a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray powder diffractometer
(a 9 kW Cu Kα rotating anode, operating at 40 kV and 150 mA)
and a D\teX Ultra 1D silicon strip detector. A Göbel mirror
was used to convert the divergent X-ray beam into a parallel beam
and to suppress the Cu Kβ radiation. The analysis of the diffractograms
was carried out using PDXL 2.7.2.0 software from Rigaku. A custom-made
holder has been used for the thin film analysis performed in a transmission
geometry (TXRD), which presents several advantages for thin-film studies.
It avoids the presence of artifacts in the diffractograms, especially
in the case of irregular and crinkled surfaces. In addition, the volume
of the sample analyzed during each angular scan is constant in the
transmission geometry, while the linear detector used in TXRD allows
shorter measuring times. For the peak assignment, the reference structure
94-873-7695 from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) was used.69

Micro-Raman spectra were collected at
ambiance by a Horiba Jobin
Yvon LabRAM HR800 μRaman spectrometer, equipped with a microscope.
We used the 632.8 nm excitation line in backscattering geometry through
a 50 × objective lens. The power of the laser was ca. 0.25 mW.
The grating used was 600 lines per mm with a spectral resolution of
approximately 1 cm–1.

Differential scanning
calorimeter (DSC) measurements were performed
by a Perkin-Elmer Diamond calorimeter, using an indium standard for
the calibration. Initially, we measured the baseline from 0 °C
up to 200 °C at a rate of 10 °C min–1.
Then, ca. 12 mg of the P(3HB) films were placed in aluminum sample
pans, and heated from −5 to 200 °C at a rate of 10 °C
min–1 and subsequently cooled down to 0 °C
at a rate of 10 °C min–1.

4.7 Electrical Properties of the Composite Films
The electrical
transport properties of the P(3HB)/GnP nanocomposites
were studied using a Karl Suss RA150 Probe Station, by the 2-probe
method. Square pieces of the samples were cut and silver electrodes
were applied at the opposite sides (2 mm apart). The bias ranged from
−1 to + 1 V.

4.8 Mechanical Properties of
the Composite Films
Mechanical properties were measured by
uniaxial tension tests on
an Instron 3365 Universal testing equipment. The samples were cut
into 2 mm wide and 10 mm long strips and mounted on the clamps. The
thickness was ca. 0.2 mm for pristine samples and ca. 0.1 mm for hot-pressed
samples. The displacement rate was 1 mm min–1. From
the resulting stress–strain curves, the Young’s modulus,
ultimate tensile strength, and elongation at break were calculated.
Average results were calculated from 3 repeats for each material.

4.9 Oxygen Barrier Properties of the Composite
Films
The oxygen permeation tests of the composites were
performed using an Oxysense 5250i device (Oxysense) equipped with
a film permeation chamber, following the protocol presented in ref (38) (ASTM Method F3136-15).
The cylindrical permeation chamber consists of two parts, the sensing
well (purged with nitrogen) and the driving well (open). Square pieces
of the samples (6 cm × 6 cm) were placed between the two wells.
The monitor sensor on the sensing well, measured the oxygen transmission
rate (OTR, mL m–2 day–1), continuously
until the steady state was reached, and the oxygen permeability (OP)
of the films is then calculated by:  where Ft is the
film thickness.
