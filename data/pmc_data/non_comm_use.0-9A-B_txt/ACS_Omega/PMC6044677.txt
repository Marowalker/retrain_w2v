We
have developed nanocomposites based on galactitol/adipic acid in the molar
ratio of 1:1 with different weight percentages of graphene oxide (GO).
The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of enhanced
physicochemical properties achieved due to the addition of GO to the
polymers on cellular responses. The chemical structures of the polymer
and composites were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
Scanning electron microscopy revealed the uniform distribution of
GO in the polymers. Differential scanning calorimetry showed no significant
variation in the glass-transition temperature of the nanocomposites.
Dynamic mechanical analysis demonstrated the increase of Young’s
modulus with the increase in the addition of GO to the polymer from 0.5 to 1 wt % and a dramatic decrease
in modulus with the addition of 2 wt % GO to the polyester. Contact
angle analysis illustrated a slight increase in hydrophilicity with
the addition of GO to the polyester. Investigations on the hydrolytic
degradation and dye release were performed and revealed that the degradation
and release decreased with the increase in the weight percentages
of GO but increased for 2 wt % GO with the polymer. The rates of degradation
and dye release followed first-order and Higuchi kinetics, respectively.
The initial in vitro cytocompatibility studies exhibited minimal toxicity.
Mineralization studies proved that these nanocomposites stimulated
osteogenesis. This study has salient implications for designing biodegradable
polymers for use as scaffolds with tailored release.

1 Introduction
The usage of graphene
as fillers in polymer nanocomposites has
been trending in the recent years owing to its remarkable thermal,
mechanical, and electrical properties.1 Recently, polymer nanocomposites based on graphene were explored
in the field of pharmaceutics and tissue regeneration.2 The mechanical strength of soft polymers can be increased
by the incorporation of graphene for potential use in hard tissue
engineering applications.3 Graphene-based
nanomaterials were proven to exhibit better cell adhesion, proliferation,
and differentiation that could be attributed to its flexibility and
adaptability.4 Because of its noncovalent
binding abilities, graphene can play a crucial role in directing the
undifferentiated stem cells toward osteogenic lineage.5

Robust interfacial interactions between the polymer
matrix and
the nanoparticle are considered critical in engineering a mechanically
strong composite. One popular strategy to achieve good interaction
is by chemical functionalization of the surface.6 The chemical modifications such as addition of hydroxyl
and amine groups to the surface of nanoparticles demonstrated better
biological responses.3,7 Graphene oxide (GO), a form of
graphene rich in epoxide, carboxyl, and hydroxyl groups, has been
explored for biological applications. Despite the nonbiodegradability
of graphene, the biocompatibility of graphene is greatly enhanced
by synthesizing GO, which is a result of functionalization of graphene.8 Given the recent surge in studies based on GO
nanocomposites, there are numerous reports evaluating their toxicity.
When GO is incorporated in polymers in small amounts (<3 wt %),
it does not pose any toxicity against mammalian cells.9 This study showed that GO showed greater cytocompatibility
than polymer and there was no statistical difference between the % cytotoxicity
of the GO–polymer composite and the polymer. The biocompatibility
of GO nanoparticles was well-illustrated for their application in
drug delivery.10 The active chemical groups
present in GO were shown to augment interactions with proteins, resulting
in improved cell adhesion and proliferation.5 GO has also been shown to enhance the differentiation of adipose-derived
mesenchymal stem cells to osteoblasts.11

Polyesters are a widely preferred class of polymers for biomedical
applications owing to their innumerable advantages, such as hydrolytic
degradation.12 Thermoset polymers are advantageous
for biomedical applications owing to their unaltered structure throughout
the degradation as they degrade via a combination of bulk and surface
erosion mechanisms.13 Toxicity can be minimized
by choosing monomers based on plant or animal origin that are likely
to be cytocompatible. Galactitol, derived from galactose and dicarboxylic
acids, is eliminated via urine and the β-oxidation pathway and
thus proven to be less toxic.14,15

GO–polymer
nanocomposites had been assessed for bone regeneration
in the previous reports.16,17 These reports had demonstrated
the contribution of graphene in increasing the mechanical strength
and for differentiation of stem cells toward osteogenic lineage. The
toxicity of GO is highly size- and dose-dependent, and no toxicity
was observed in mice for medium and low doses of GO.18 The ability of macrophages to engulf GO sheets of about
1 μm has been demonstrated in a previous report.19 Galactitol and adipic acid, a dicarboxylic acid-based
polyester, in the molar ratio of 1:1 was synthesized in this study
based on our previous report.20 Galactitol-based
polymers showed good cytocompatibility and potential for bone regeneration.
This polymer was chosen based on its lowest modulus (0.37 MPa) among
the other polymers synthesized in the study. It was hypothesized that
the modulus of this polymer can be increased significantly by the
addition of GO for its potential use in bone regeneration. The physical
properties, degradation, and release of dyes from the composites have
been investigated for different weight percentages of GO in the polymer.
To examine their efficiency in inducing osteogenesis, mineralization
studies were also conducted.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Polymer Synthesis
The formation of
poly(galactitol adipate) (PGaAd) is through the conventional esterification
reaction, leading to the ester bond formation with the elimination
of water molecules (Scheme 1). The prepolymers were completely soluble in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO). After the curing process, the cured polymers do not dissolve
in any solvent. The Hummers method used for the preparation of GO
is a simple method that eliminates the use of catalyst unlike chemical
vapor deposition. Metallic catalysts used in the preparation of GO
might be toxic to cells.21

Acid Polyester in the Ratio of 1:1
Red
dots indicate that these
−OH groups might also be involved in esterification because
it is a random polymerization.

The polymers
were given the nomenclature based on the first letters
of monomers. P corresponds to polymer, Ga denotes galactitol, Ad stands
for adipic acid, and GO signifies graphene oxide. The weight percentages
of GO added will be indicated in the end. PGaAd stands for poly(galactitol
adipate), which is the neat polymer. With the addition of GO, the
polymers were denoted PGaAdGO0.5, PGaAdGO1, and PGaAdGO2 for all of
the weight percentages of GO used, respectively.

2.2 Polymer Characterization
2.2.1 Fourier
Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy
FTIR spectra22 (Figure 1) of PGaAd and all composites displayed a
characteristic ester carbonyl (C=O) stretching peak around
1720 cm–1. Other peaks such as −OH stretching
peaks at 3400 cm–1 and asymmetric and symmetric
−CH stretching peaks at 2945 and 2875 cm–1 can be observed in all spectra. The peaks corresponding to the C=C
vibration of graphitic domains are visible around 1650 cm–1. The peaks related to carboxyl, carbonyl, and epoxy groups in graphene
oxide can be seen at 1370, 1240, and 1070 cm–1,
respectively.23 These peaks are also visible
in PGA spectra as the polymer also contains the aforementioned groups.

Figure 1 FTIR spectra
of PGaAd and composites.

2.2.2 Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR) Spectroscopy
Proton nuclear magnetic resonance
(1H NMR) spectroscopy was performed for further verification
of the FTIR data of PGaAd (Figure 2). The peaks reported matched with those in the previously
reported similar studies.24 The peaks present
between 3.3 and 5.5 ppm could be attributed to the protons of galactitol.
The peaks in the regions of 2–3 ppm could be assigned to the
protons adjacent to the −COOH groups of adipic acid (HOOC–CH2). The peak at 1.5 ppm could be
attributed to the protons of −CH2 present next to
the −CH2 group in adipic acid (HOOC–CH2–CH2).

Figure 2 NMR spectra
of the prepolymer of PGaAd.

2.2.3 Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
DSC results demonstrated (Table 1) that Tg increased with
an increase in the GO content. This could be attributed to the interfacial interactions between the polymer and
the nanofiller.25 It was also evident from
FTIR that the −OH groups and carboxyl groups present in GO
interacted with the −OH and −COOH groups of adipic acid
during the curing process. This was evident when all of the peaks
were normalized to the peak at 1073 cm–1 and the
areas of the peaks of the composites at 1720 cm–1 were greater than those of PGA. Thermal curing of the polymers resulted
in the formation of strong covalent bonds and leads to the restriction
in polymer chain mobility.26 Therefore, Tg increases with an increase in the nanofiller
content. Many literature reports have shown at least 4 °C increase
in Tg with the addition of nanofillers,
which is similar to that reported in this study, where Tg increased from 25 to 29 °C with the addition of 2 wt % GO to
PGaAd.25 For example, GO intercalated by
surfactant was blended with polypropylene-graft-maleic
anhydride and showed 1.2 °C increase in Tg.(27)

Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)
The molecular
weight of the prepolymer of PGaAd was around 973 g/mol (Figure 3), which was similar to the
one reported for the other prepolymers in the family of galactitol-based
polyesters.20

2.2.5 Dynamic
Mechanical Analysis (DMA)
The mechanical properties investigated
using DMA yielded the storage
and loss modulus values. Young’s modulus was calculated using
the storage modulus and
loss modulus obtained from DMA using the following formula28 1  In eq 1, E* is the complex modulus, E′
is the storage modulus, and E″ refers
to the loss modulus. The complex modulus may be approximately considered
as Young’s modulus. DMA results (Table 1) illustrated the increase in moduli of the
composites with an increase in GO reinforcement in polymers for 0.5
and 1 wt %. The moduli decreased with 2 wt % GO content. The moduli
increased from 0.45 to 33 MPa with the addition of 1 wt % GO to PGaAd
and then decreased to 6 MPa with the addition of 2 wt % GO. The increase
in moduli values could be due to the transfer of stress from a soft
polymer matrix to hard fillers.29 The small
increase could be due to the structural defects of graphene sheets.30 The decrease in the modulus values could be
ascribed to the possibility of agglomeration and nonuniformity in
dispersion with an increase in the filler loading. A similar decrease
has been reported for GO, carbon nanotubes, and other carbonaceous
filler materials.31,32 In a similar study, the modulus
increased from 209 to 305 MPa when poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL)
and 1% GO were blended.33

On the
basis of the values of the calculated complex modulus, the cross-linking
densities for PGaAd and composites were calculated using the following
formula15 2  In eq 2, n is the cross-linking density, E* corresponds to Young’s modulus, R represents the gas constant, and T signifies the
temperature. The temperature was assumed constant (37 °C = 310
K). The cross-linking values increased with an increase in modulus
values (Table 1). With
a higher degree of cross-linking, increase in modulus values can be
observed. This trend was reported in earlier studies.34 As discussed in the previous sections, the functional groups
of GO contributed to the increase in cross-linking in the composites.
The cross-linking density was the highest for 1 wt % GO composite
and the lowest for PGaAd.

2.2.6 Surface Water Wettability
The contact
angle measurements revealed that the composites became slightly hydrophilic
with an increase in the GO content (Table 1). The presence of hydrophilic polar functional
groups contributes to the hydrophilicity of GO.3,35 The
contact angles decreased from 86 to 82° with the addition of
1 wt % GO to PCL, which is similar to the composite studied here,
where the contact angle decreased from 82 to 78° with the addition
of 1 wt % GO to PGaAd.3

2.2.7 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
SEM images (Figure 4) revealed that GO
flakes were uniformly distributed in the case
of PGaAdGO0.5 and PGaAdGO1.

2 μm
at 15 000× magnification. The yellow arrows point to GO.

2.2.8 In
Vitro Hydrolytic Degradation and Kinetics
It is vital to
study the degradation of the polymer to enable a
good match in the time scale of the scaffold degradation and tissue
regeneration at the implanted site. As the polymer degrades, the leaching
of acids will reduce the pH that has a significant effect on hydrolysis.
Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) is used to maintain the pH and to
reduce the effect of pH on hydrolysis. PBS is widely used for hydrolytic
degradation studies.36,37 Degradation was also conducted
to study the effect of nanofillers on the degradation of the polymer.
In the case of PGaAd, 100% degradation occurred in 120 h (Figure 5). However, only
93 and 68% degradations were observed in the case of PGaAdGO0.5 and
PGaAdGO1. The degradation was higher in the case of PGaAdGO2, which
was 73% in 120 h. For PGaAdGO0.5, PGaAdGO1, and PGaAdGO2, 98, 82,
and 86% degradations were observed in a week, respectively. The trend
was similar to that of modulus. This could be attributed to the increased
chemical interactions between the functional groups of GO and PGaAd,
as described above. Agglomeration of nanoparticles results in increased
defects in the polymer, which could accelerate the degradation process.
Incorporation of fillers, like clay, increased the stability of the
polyesters and thereby exhibited slower degradation.38

Figure 5 In vitro hydrolytic degradation profiles of PGaAd and composites
in 20 mL of PBS solution (pH = 7.4). The insets show the variation
of −ln(Mt/M0) with time, and the degradation rate constants are determined
from the slopes of the linear plots and are tabulated in Table 1.

Power law was used to model the rate of the degradation as
follows 3  In eq 3, M is associated to the mass of the polymer, t denotes time, kd signifies
the degradation rate constant, and n represents the
order of the degradation. In this case, the first-order degradation
was observed for all of the polymers. The linear plots of −ln(Mt/M∞) with time when n = 1 are shown as insets
in Figure 5. The intercepts
were 0, and the slopes yielded kd values,
which are tabulated in Table 1.

The trend for the values of the rate coefficients, kd, was similar to that of the degradation. PGaAd
showed
the highest degradation rate, which was 39.1 × 10–3 h–1, whereas the lowest one was for PGaAdGO1,
which was 9.7 × 10–3 h–1.
The degradation rate of PGaAd is approximately 4 times higher than
that of PGaAdGO1. It is also approximately 3.5 and 1.7 times higher
than that of PGaAdGO2 and PGaAdGO0.5, respectively. Thus, it can be
concluded that the incorporation of nanoparticles slowed down the
degradation process.

2.2.9 In Vitro Dye Release
and Kinetics
The drug release kinetics is influenced by a
number of factors, such
as hydrophobicity, cross-linking, degradation, diffusion, dispersion
of drugs inside the polymer, etc.34,39 The trend
of the release of the dyes was similar to that of the degradation
data (Figure 6). Rhodamine
B (RB) and rhodamine B base (RBB) were loaded into the composites
and PGaAd to study the capability of release of both hydrophilic and
hydrophobic drugs. In the case of RB (Figure 5a), 100% release was observed for PGaAd in
144 h. However, only 82, 59, and 48% releases were observed for PGaAdGO0.5,
PGaAdGO2, and PGaAdGO1, respectively. For PGAGO0.5, PGAGO2, and PGaAdGO1,
90, 67, and 57% releases were observed in a week, respectively. In
the case of RBB (Figure 5b), 89, 82, 67, and 54% releases were observed for PGaAd, PGaAdGO0.5,
PGaAdGO2, and PGaAdGO1 in a week, respectively. This could be attributed
to the increased stability for reduced release and possibility of
agglomeration for increased release as explained in the In Vitro Hydrolytic Degradation and
Kinetics section above.

Figure 6 In vitro dye release profiles of PGaAd
and composites in 20 mL
of PBS solution (pH = 7.4). Release of (a) RB and (b) RBB. The insets
of all of the plots show the variation of Mt/M∞ with t0.5, and the release rate constant, kRB and kRBB, are
obtained from the slopes of the linear plot and are tabulated in Table 1.

As the trend of release was similar to that of degradation,
it
is clear that the release was mainly governed by the degradation of
the polymer and composites. In addition, diffusion played a crucial
role because the release of the dyes happened followed by water inflow.
This could be ascribed to the slightly slower release of RBB when
compared to that of RB because of its hydrophobic nature. The same
trends were reported when the release of RBB was slower than that
of RB.40

The dye release was modeled
by the Korsmeyer–Peppas model,41 which is given by 4  In eq 4, Mt/M∞ denotes the fraction of the quantity of the
dye released at the desired time duration t and at
infinite time, respectively. k signifies the rate
constant, and n corresponds to the release exponent,
explaining the mechanism of the dye/drug transport inside the polymer.
The power law holds true only for first 60% of the drug release profile.42Mt/M∞ versus time was plotted on a log–log
plot (as shown in the insets of Figure 6a,b), and the data were fitted with n = 0.5, indicative of Higuchi kinetics/Fickian diffusion.43 The release rate coefficients were calculated
on the basis of the initial slopes with 0 intercept and are tabulated
in Table 1.

The
trends of dye release rate coefficients were similar to those
of dye release. In the case of RB, kRB of PGaAd was approximately 1.7, 1.5, and 1.2 times greater than
that of PGaAdGO0.5, PGaAdGO2, and PGaAdGO1, respectively. Similarly,
in the case of RBB, kRBB of PGaAd was
approximately 1.9, 1.6, and 1.2 times greater than that of PGaAdGO0.5,
PGaAdGO2, and PGaAdGO1, respectively.

It is also worth noting
that the dye release was slower than degradation.
For example, in the case of RB, 100% degradation of PGaAd was observed
in 120 h, whereas complete release from PGaAd occurred only in 144
h. The FTIR spectra of the physical mixtures of the dye and composites
were compared with the spectra of the polymer containing dye after
curing (FTIR spectra not shown). The spectra indicated that the −COOH
and −OCH3 groups of the dye reacted with the functional
groups of the polymer, which resulted in a slower release and is consistent
with earlier studies.40

2.2.10 Cytocompatibility Studies
2.2.10.1 Water-Soluble Tetrazolium Salts (WST)
Assay
The cytocompatibility was studied by measuring the
number of live cells that result in yellow formazan in the WST assay. The obtained absorbance
values are converted to the number of cells based on a previously
obtained calibration curve. The assay proved that PGaAd and all of
the composites were minimally cytotoxic (Figure 7). No significant differences were found
in cell numbers for PGaAd and PGaAdGO0.5 with tissue culture polystyrene
(TCPS). Despite the statistically significant differences between
the control (TCPS) and the samples on day 3, the cell numbers doubled
from day 1 to day 3 in all cases, implying that the cells proliferated
well and these samples were cytocompatible. PGaAd showed the least
increase in cell numbers. This could be attributed to the leaching
of acids, which will result in the change of pH to acidic. An acidic
environment is not friendly for the survival for cells. When these
materials are placed inside the body, the toxicity is minimized because
there will be a large amount of continuous blood flow in our body
and the acids if leached will be minimal and washed out. However,
the hydrolysis rate of a degradable material can cause inflammation
in animal tissue and would need further investigation.

Figure 7 Cell viability of PGaAd
and composites determined by the WST assay
for day 1 and day 3. *The samples are statistically significant when
compared to the control.

The cell numbers were higher in the case of composites, whereas
the highest cell numbers were found in the case of control. Among
the composites, PGaAdGO0.5 showed the highest cell numbers, from 4500
to 13 000. This was followed by PGaAdGO1, which showed an increase
in cell numbers from 3350 to 11 400. PGaAdGO2 showed an increase
in cell numbers from 3740 to 8740. This can be attributed to the presence
of hydrophilic functional groups present in GO that contributed to
the increase in cell attachment. The hydrophilicity was further verified
by contact angle measurements. The increase in cell number decreased
with an increase in the GO content. Incorporation of nanoparticles
resulted in the reduction in toxicity of the polymer as well as improved
the biological response of the biomaterial.44 However, with an increase in the concentration of GO, it could induce
slight toxicity, as observed in our study. It was demonstrated that
GO in higher concentration can induce oxidative stress based on dose
and size.45

2.2.10.2 Live/Dead Assay
Live/dead assay
was used to measure fractional cell viability. Live cells were stained
green, and dead cells were stained red.46 The images supported the data of the WST assay (Figure 8). The number of viable cells
was the highest in the case of control. The viable cells were the
least in PGaAd. All of the composites exhibited a higher number of
viable cells when compared to those in PGaAd and lesser number of
viable cells when compared to those in the control. As described in
the previous section, the higher number of viable cells was observed
in PGaAdGO0.5, whereas the least number of viable cells was observed
in PGaAdGO2.

various
polyesters on day 3: (a) PGaAd, (b) PGaAdGO1, and (c) TCPS. The scale
bar indicates 20 μm. All images are taken at 4× magnification.
Viable cells appear green, whereas nonviable cells appear red.

2.2.10.3 DNA Quantification Assay
The
DNA content increased from day 14 to day 21 on PGaAd and PGaAdGO1
films and control (Figure 9). The differences between the DNA content in the samples
and TCPS were statistically significant on both day 14 and day 21.
This could be associated with the hydrophobic nature of PGaAd where
the initial cell attachment could be low, and it was significantly
better in the case of slightly hydrophilic PGaAdGO1. Nevertheless,
the increase in DNA content on both the samples indicated that these
composites may induce better cell adhesion and proliferation. The
values of DNA content in the case of PGaAd increased to 3370 ng on
day 21 from 2300 ng on day 14. In the case of PGaAdGO1, the DNA content
increased from 3900 ng on day 14 to 4800 ng on day 21. In the case
of TCPS, the DNA content increased from 5000 ng on day 14 to 6000
ng on day 21. The presence of hydrophilic functional groups in GO
facilitated better cell attachment and proliferation in the case of
PGaAdGO1 when compared to that in PGaAd. Hydrophilic surfaces demonstrate
better cell adhesion and growth as they mediate the binding of cell
adhesive proteins, such as fibronectin and vitronectin.47 Although the cell attachment and proliferation
were lesser on samples, they induced osteogenesis better than that by the control, as explained
later.

PGaAd and PGaAdGO1 by the PicoGreen assay on day 14 and day 21. *The
samples are statistically significant (p < 0.05)
when compared to the control. The results represent average ±
standard deviation (SD) for n = 3.

2.2.10.4 Cell Morphology
Examination
of the morphology of the cell becomes crucial as it can be correlated
to the cell function.48 Optical bright
field images (Figure 10) displayed the “spindle shaped” morphology of the
cells in both the samples and the control. Good cell–cell communication
was observed with well-spread appearance in both the samples and the
control. This further confirmed that these polymers are cytocompatible
and can be used for tissue regeneration.

the degradation products of PGaAdGO1 at 10× magnification. The
scale bar is 20 μm.

2.2.11 Osteogenic Differentiation
Study
2.2.11.1 Mineralization by Alizarin Red Staining
Mineralization by alizarin red staining confirmed the presence
of calcium on the films of PGaAd, PGaAdGO1, and control (Figure 11). The presence
of calcium deposits by the cells can be correlated to the differentiation
of preosteoblast cells into mature osteoblasts.49 Alizarin red staining showed that there was an increase
in calcium deposits from day 14 to day 21 on the films of PGaAd, PGaAdGO1,
and control. The samples exhibited better calcium deposition than
that by control. There were statistically significant differences
between calcium deposition in the films and in the control on day
14. However, on day 21, there were no statistical differences between
PGaAd and control, whereas there were differences between PGaAdGO1
and control. This could be due to the relatively high modulus as it
is proven that materials with a higher modulus drive osteogenesis.50 Also, the presence of carboxyl groups in GO
facilitates the binding of calcium and phosphate ions.51,52 In addition to this, it has been reported earlier that β-glycerol
phosphate in the osteoinductive medium used in this study will be
absorbed by GO in the polymer and enhance osteogenesis.5 Therefore, it can be concluded that these composites
effectively induce osteogenesis.

deposition by alizarin
red S dye on films of PGaAd and composites on day 14 and day 21. *The
samples are statistically significant (p < 0.05)
when compared to control. The results represent average ± SD
for n = 3.

2.2.11.2 Alkaline Phosphatase Expression
To further verify osteogenesis, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity
expression was evaluated (Figure 12). ALP expression is an early marker of osteogenic
differentiation.53−55Figure 10 compiled that the ALP activity increased from day 14 to day
21 on all films and control. The films showed higher ALP expression
than control on both day 14 and day 21, and the differences were statistically
significant. ALP expression increased from 1.6 × 10–4 to 3.9 × 10–4, 7 × 10–4 to 14.6 × 10–4, and 3.4 × 10–4 to 8.1 × 10–4 in the case of PGaAd, PGaAdGO1,
and control, respectively, from day 14 to day 21. As explained in
the earlier section, the presence of −COOH and −OH groups
in GO enhances osteogenesis and upregulates osteogenic gene expression.56 The incorporation of GO can serve as an alternate
for the modification of biomaterials by incorporating biomolecules
such as bone morphogenic protein57 to enhance
osteogenesis. The incorporation of GO has several advantages, such
as stability, low cost, and easy processing.53 The above
studies illustrated that these polymers direct cells toward osteogenic
lineage. These polymers can be further tested in vivo to evaluate
the osteogenic abilities.

3 Conclusions
Nanocomposites
with different weight percentages of GO in galactitol-based
polyesters were prepared. Glass-transition temperature and modulus
increased, whereas contact angle decreased with an increase in weight
percentages of GO. The degradation and dye release studies showed
that the degradation and release decreased with an increase in weight
percentages of GO, whereas for 2 wt % GO, the degradation and release
increased. The degradation followed first-order kinetics, whereas
the dye release followed Higuchi kinetics. PGaAdGO1 exhibited a higher
modulus and slower degradation. Cytocompatibility studies showed that
these composites are minimally cytotoxic. Osteogenic differentiation
studies proved that PGaAdGO1 exhibited significant efficiency in dictating
the cells toward osteogenesis.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
Graphite flakes were purchased
from Supreme Company, India. Sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, hydrochloric
acid, potassium permanganate, hydrogen peroxide, and solvent DMF were
procured from Merck, India. Galactitol, a polyol, was purchased from
TCI Chemicals, Japan. Adipic acid was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

4.2 Synthesis of PGA
The synthesis method
was similar to that in the previous report.20 Galactitol and adipic acid were taken in the molar ratio of 1:1
in a 50 mL round-bottomed flask. The melt condensation reaction was
performed under the experimental conditions of 180 °C for 2 h
in the presence of nitrogen atmosphere. The prepolymer obtained (85–90%
yield) was further thermally cured at 120 °C under vacuum for
3 days (Scheme 1).

4.3 Preparation of GO
The preparation
of GO was done by the chemical oxidation of graphite flakes based
on the Hummers method.58 Graphite flakes
(1 g) were added to the round-bottomed flask containing a mixture
of 55 mL of sulfuric acid and 7 mL of phosphoric acid. The mixture
was stirred under ice bath for 30 min for exfoliation of flakes. Potassium
permanganate (6 g) was added to the mixture for oxidation and was
stirred for 3 days at 25 °C. Followed by this, hydrogen peroxide
was added to halt the reaction and to remove the excess potassium
permanganate. The GO obtained was washed with 1 M hydrochloric acid
and deionized (DI) water for 2 weeks. Later, GO was obtained by centrifugation
at 10 000 rpm for 1 h and dried at 25 °C for 3 days. This
was followed by vacuum oven drying at 40 °C for 1 week.

4.4 Preparation of GO/Polymer Nanocomposite
The prepolymer
of PGaAd was dissolved in DMF. Separately, GO was
dispersed in DI water. The weight percentages of GO were 0.5, 1, and
2% of the total weights of PGA taken. The GO/polymer nanocomposites
were prepared individually by mixing the appropriate weight percentage
of GO dispersed in water and PGaAd solution. DMF and water were miscible,
and no phase separation was observed. DMF and water were evaporated
in a thermal oven. Later, the polymer along with GO was thermally
cured, as described in Section 4.2, resulting in the formation of the nanocomposites.

4.5 Characterization and Studies of Nanocomposites
Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF
MS) were performed for the prepolymer as the cured polymers are insoluble
in solvents.

4.5.1 FTIR Spectroscopy
FTIR was performed
on PGaAd and nanocomposites before and after curing using attenuated
total reflectance (U-ATR, PerkinElmer FTIR Spectrum BX) mode. Scanning
was performed in the range of 600–4000 cm–1 with the average of 12 scans and 4 cm–1 resolution
on all samples.

4.5.2 1H NMR Spectroscopy
Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) was performed
for PGaAd using a 400 MHz Bruker NMR spectrometer. The prepolymer
was dissolved in deuterated DMSO, which had internal calibration.

4.5.3 Differential Scanning Calorimetry
Differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC; TA Instruments) was performed
to determine the thermal properties of PGaAd and nanocomposites. Samples
weighing 3–5 mg were taken in aluminum pans and heated and
cooled in the range of −50 to 200 °C at the rate of 10
°C/min in the presence of nitrogen atmosphere. To eliminate the
processing information, the heating and cooling cycle was repeated
again.

4.5.4 Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization
Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)
MALDI-TOF
MS was performed to find the molecular weight of the
prepolymer (UltrafleXtreme MALDI Bruker Daltonics) of PGaAd. The prepolymer
was dissolved in DMF/acetonitrile mixture before analysis.

4.5.5 Dynamic Mechanical Analysis
The
mechanical properties of PGaAd and nanocomposites were investigated
by DMA (Q800; TA Instruments). Films of PGaAd and nanocomposites were
cut in accordance with the dimensions (30 mm × 5 mm × 1
mm). Frequency sweep from 1 to 10 Hz at 37 °C, 15 μm amplitude,
and preload of 0.01 N were used as operational conditions. A tension
clamp designed for film/fiber was used.

4.5.6 Surface
Water Wettability
The water
contact angles of PGaAd and nanocomposites were measured using a goniometer
(Data Physics). DI water droplet (1 μL) was placed on the surface
of the films, and sufficient time was provided for the attainment
of equilibrium. The readings were taken, and the data are presented
as mean ± standard deviation of three independent readings.

4.5.7 Scanning Electron Microscopy
Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM; Zeiss) was performed to observe the distribution
of GO sheets in the polymer. Gold coating was performed for 100 s
to achieve a 10 nm coating.

4.5.8 In
Vitro Hydrolytic Polymer Degradation
PGaAd and nanocomposites
were punched as round disks of dimensions
4.5 mm × 1 mm at 25 °C. These samples were transferred to
nylon mesh bags and submerged in 50 mL centrifuge tubes containing
20 mL of PBS of pH 7.4. These disks were moved to an incubator shaker
maintained at 37 °C and shaking at 100 rpm. The samples were
rinsed in water and dried in a hot air oven to obtain a constant weight
at fixed time points. PBS was refreshed every day to avoid the effects
caused due to pH variations.

The differences in the mass of
the samples after drying at every time point were used to calculate
their mass loss. It was calculated using eq 5 5  where Mo is the
initial mass of the polymer and Mt is
the mass of the samples after degradation at the desired time interval.

4.5.9 In Vitro Dye Release
PGaAd and
nanocomposites before curing were mixed with dyes of both hydrophilic
and hydrophobic nature to assess their release capabilities. Two dyes
belonging to a similar family, RB and RBB, were chosen. DMF was used
as a common solvent to dissolve polymer/GO and the dyes (5 wt %).
The solvent was evaporated, leaving behind a homogeneous mixture of
polymer/GO along with dyes. This mixture was cured, and disks were
punched out for the studies. They were placed in 20 mL of PBS of pH
7.4 and moved to the incubator shaker with an agitation of 100 rpm
and 37 °C. PBS was replenished every day. PBS (100 μL)
containing dye was collected at desired time durations in a 96-well
plate for each sample. The quantity of the dye released was assessed
using a microplate reader (BioTek Synergy HT) with the wavelength
adjusted to 553 nm. Using the calibration curves, the concentrations
of the dyes were obtained from the absorbance values. The polymers
were dissolved in a basic solution of NaOH, and the total concentration of the loaded dye was calculated.
On the basis of the total concentration, the fractional concentration
of the dye released at each time point and cumulative release were
calculated.

4.5.10 Cytocompatibility of
the Polymer
4.5.10.1 Cell Culture
As these composites
were intended for use in bone tissue engineering applications, it
is necessary to study the cytocompatibility property using osteoblasts.
MC3T3-E1 cells (subclone 4), which are mouse calvarial preosteoblasts
(American Type Culture Collection), were used. The α-minimum
essential medium (Sigma) with 1% antibiotics (Sigma) and fetal bovine
serum (10% v/v; Gibco, Life Technologies) was used to culture the
cells in T-75 flasks (maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2).

4.5.10.2 Cell Viability
The sterilized
(UV-treated) polymer disks were placed in 5 mL of cell culture medium
(one disc in each centrifuge tube), and they were maintained for 24
h in a CO2 incubator (37 °C). Thus, a conditioned
medium was obtained (the medium with the degradation products of the
polymer). Triplicates were used for PGaAd and each composite type.
Simultaneously, 2000 cells in 200 μL of culture medium were
added to each well in a 96-well plate. They were left for 12 h for
effective cell attachment and cell proliferation before replacing
them with conditioned media. Fresh medium was added to the cells that
served as controls. Cell viability and cell morphology were examined
after the cells were exposed to the conditioned media for 1 day and
3 days.

Cell viability was studied using the WST-1 assay. A
single well was assigned for each of the triplicates of PGaAd and
composite type for two time points (n = 4 ×
3 × 2 = 24). Three wells were used as controls without polymers
at all time points (n = 3 × 2 = 6). The WST
reagent (Roche) was prepared in the working concentration of 10/100
μL media per well and added to each well. The well plate was
kept in a CO2 incubator for 1 h till the color change of
the media to yellow. Using a microplate reader, the absorbance was
measured at 440 nm.

4.5.10.3 Live/Dead Assay
Cell viability
was also verified qualitatively by the live/dead fluorescence cytotoxicity
assay (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). Live and dead cells were stained
using 2 mM calcein dye and 4 mM ethidium homodimer, respectively.
These dyes were allowed to bind for 15 min in a CO2 incubator
at 37 °C and removed later to avoid false positive results. They
were imaged using a fluorescent microscope (Olympus).

4.5.10.4 Cell Proliferation
Cell proliferation
was evaluated using the PicoGreen assay that is based on DNA quantification1 on the surface of PGaAd and PGaAdGO1 films based
on the highest moduli and slow degradation. Cells (4 × 103) were seeded onto the surface of the films (2D films of PGaAd
and PGaAdGO1). At 14 days and 21 days time points, 0.2 mL of lysis
solution with 0.2 mg/mL proteinase K and 0.02% sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS) was added after the medium removal. The incubation time was
12 h at 25 °C. This mixture (0.1 mL) was taken and PicoGreen
dye (0.1 mL; 5 μg/mL in 1× Tris–ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid buffer) was added to this mixture. The fluorescence intensity
was measured at 480 nm excitation and 520 nm emission using a microplate
reader. The DNA was quantified using a standard curve based on serial
dilutions of known DNA concentration. Cells cultured on TCPS were
used as controls.

4.5.10.5 Cell Morphology
For studying
cell morphology, the cells were fixed by 3.7% formaldehyde (Merck)
for 15 min. The cells were given water wash before bright field imaging
(Olympus).

4.5.11 Osteogenic Differentiation
Study
Osteogenic differentiation was illustrated by the mineralization
deposits and measuring alkaline phosphatase activity based on culturing
MC3T3 cells onto the surface of PGaAd and PGaAdGO1 films. This composite
was selected on the basis of the highest storage modulus and slow
degradation among the polymers studied. Complete knockout Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with β-glycerol
phosphate (10 mM) and ascorbic acid (25 μM) (Sigma) was used
to culture the cells that are capable of osteogenesis as reported.59

4.5.11.1 Alizarin Red Staining
Calcium
mineralization was studied at day 14 and day 21. At these time points,
the cells were fixed (3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min, as described earlier).
Alizarin red stain (Sigma) was used to quantify calcium deposits.
The filtered dye was added to the cells. Quadruplicates were used
for PGaAd and PGaAdGO1. TCPS served as the control. The dye binds
to the calcium present in the films. Later, the samples were washed
with water until a clear solution was obtained after the removal of
dye that was not bound to calcium to avoid increased absorbance values.
The dye that was bound to calcium in the films was dissolved using
5% SDS in 0.5 HCl for 25 min. Using a microplate reader, the absorbance
values were measured at 405 nm. The values were normalized to those
of the cell numbers obtained from the PicoGreen assay.

4.5.11.2 Alkaline Phosphatase Activity
The ALP was quantified
on day 14 and day 21 by the p-nitrophenyl phosphate
dye (Sigma).54 Lysis
solution, 200 μL, comprising 0.2% Triton X-100 was used to lyse
the cells for 12 h. Later, the mixture was freeze–thawed from
−80 to 37 °C at least three times. To the lysis solution,
equal amount of dye was added in 96-well plates, and the absorbance
values were measured using a microplate reader at 405 nm. The values
were normalized to the cell numbers obtained from the PicoGreen assay.

4.5.12 Statistical Analysis
One-way analysis of variance with Tukey’s test was performed to assess
the significant differences across the samples and controls. p Values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically
significant.
