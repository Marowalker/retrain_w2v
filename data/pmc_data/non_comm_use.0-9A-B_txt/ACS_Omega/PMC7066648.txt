Because of flexibility, compactness,
weavability, and ergonomic
design, yarn-shaped lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have enormous potential
applications in wearable electronics. Still, the yarn-shaped LIB with
the ability to meet commercialization requirements has never been
reported, owing to the current challenge in complex material synthesis
technologies, expensive raw material costs, poor safety performance,
and nonstandard manufacturing equipment. Herein, we propose a yarn-shaped
LIB that meets the aforementioned requirements. With a highly conductive
and flexible stainless-steel yarn acting as the current collector,
the electrode active materials and the gel electrolyte, which are
commercially available at low cost, are uniformly coated onto the
stainless-steel yarn by a simple and facile dipping-drying method.
Even at different deformation conditions (i.e., bending or knotting),
the specific capacity of the yarn-shaped LIB (7 cm long, <2 mm
in diameter) assembled from graphite and lithium iron phosphate electrodes
is maintained >85%. After charged treatment, it can successfully
power
up an electronic watch and an electronic thermo-hygrometer. Thanks
to the simple preparation process, low cost of raw materials, and
good safety performance, this work can promote the commercialization
of wearable energy storage devices.

==== Body
Introduction
With the rapid development
of wearable devices (i.e., smart watches,
wearable healthcare devices, smart clothes, etc.), the demand for
a flexible and wearable energy powering system is also increasing.1−4 In comparison with traditional power supplies (i.e., button battery,
soft pack battery, accumulator, etc.), the yarn-shaped battery has
the advantages of good mechanical integrity, high flexibility, and
versatile shapes.5−7 Furthermore, a wearable battery in a seamlessly integrated
fabric can be obtained when combining the yarn-shaped battery with
mature textile manufacturing technology. Thus, the fabrication of
the yarn-shaped battery is the key to effectively solve the bottleneck
problem for the energy supply of wearable devices.8

Recently, many attempts have been made to design
and fabricate
yarn-shaped energy storage devices with different materials and existing
technologies9−16 to enable their adaption to daily deformations (i.e., bending, folding,
etc.) and complex or extreme shape changes (i.e., rolling and twisting).14,15,17−20 For instance, yarn-shaped lithium-ion
batteries (LIBs) were fabricated by sequentially depositing thin layers
of cathode, gel electrolyte, anode, and current collector layer onto
a carbon fiber or by preparing fibrous cathode and anode materials
through 3D printing.21,22 However, the complex material
deposition techniques and the strict requirements for specific equipment
severely hindered the large-scale production of the yarn-shaped LIB.
Kwon et al.23,24 further simplified the preparation
process by adopting nickel-tin alloy or polymer electrodes without
complex deposition techniques. Specifically, they used a liquid electrolyte
[1 M lithium hexafl uorophosphate (LiPF6) in ethylene carbonate
(EC) and propylene carbonate (PC) (1:1 by volume) containing 3 wt
% vinylene carbonate] which may easily cause flammability and leakage
issues. Moreover, Peng et al. assembled environmentally friendly fiber-shaped
batteries without complex deposition techniques from electrode materials
of multiwalled carbon nanotube fibers and gel electrolytes, which
still had low ionic conductivity25,26 or high raw
material cost (∼$40 g–1).27−29 Although numerous
efforts have been made in the development of yarn-shaped LIBs, an
ideal yarn-shaped battery with good safety performance, flexibility,
low cost, and simple process is still awaiting to be achieved for
wearable electronic applications.

In general, ideal cathode
materials possess the following merits:30 high potential capacity and reversibility for
lithium intercalation/de-intercalation, excellent compatibility with
electrolytes, low-cost raw materials, and simple preparation process.
Compared with other cathode materials, lithium iron phosphate (LFP)
has higher energy density (theoretical specific capacity of 170 mA
h·g–1), less health or environmental issues,
and longer cycle life.31 Ideal anode materials32 normally have low potential but high capacity
for lithium intercalation/de-intercalation, little irreversible capacity
during the first cycle, and excellent mechanical stability together
with low cost, simple preparation process, and less environmental
pollution. As one of the commercially available LIB anode materials,
graphite has high electronic conductivity, high lithium insertion
capacity (theoretical specific capacity of 372 mA h·g–1), low lithium insertion potential (0.1 V),33 and subtle volume change of the layered structure before/after lithium
insertion. As for the ideal polymer electrolytes,34 the following requirements such as high ionic conductivity,
large lithium-ion migration number, good thermal stability, wide electrochemical
window, excellent mechanical properties and processability, low cost,
and environmental friendliness should be met. The poly(vinylidenefluoride-hexafluoro-propylene)
(PVDF-HFP) copolymer is an ideal gel electrolyte material, which maintains
high dielectric constant, excellent heat resistance, and good mechanical
properties and reduces the crystallinity of the system.35

Herein, we adopted a simple and facile
process of dipping-drying
to fabricate the yarn-shaped LIB with the cathode and anode materials
coated onto the highly conductive and flexible stainless-steel yarns
(SSYs) which act as the current collectors. The assembled 7 cm-long
yarn-shaped LIB eliminates the safety concerns, is capable of outputting
a capacity of 0.45 mA h with bending deformation, and maintains a
capacity retention rate as high as 54.2% after 50 cycles.

Results and Discussion
The fabrication process of the yarn-shaped LIB is briefly described
in this section. As shown in Figure 1, a yarn-shaped LIB with SSYs@LiFePO4 (SSY@LFP)
as the cathode, the SSYs@graphite (SSY@G) as the anode, and PVDF-HFP/LiBF4 with EC/PC as the gel electrolyte was successfully assembled.
It is advantageous that SSYs provide high electrical conductivity
and excellent flexibility, whereas gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs)
play the role of electrolytes and separators which ensure equivalent
high ionic conductivity to the liquid electrolyte and enhance the
safety performance of the battery.36−38 The structure and performance
of the fabricated yarn-shaped LIB will be scrutinized in the next
sections.

Figure 1 Schematic illustration displaying the preparation process of electrodes
and fabrication of the yarn-shaped LIB with SSY serving as the flexible
substrate and current collector.

The surface morphology of the yarn-shaped LIB is discussed in this
section. The optical image of SSY (Figure 2a1) with a diameter of about 0.6
mm demonstrates the smooth surface with metallic luster. After cleaning,
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of filaments from SSY demonstrate
very smooth surfaces without any impurities (Figure 2a2,a3). What is more,
single SSY possesses concave and convex surface structures, which
favors the contact adhesion between the active materials and the SSY.
With the active material being LFP-coated, the yarn-shaped cathode
electrode (Figures 2b1–b3 and S2a,b) (diameter ∼0.78 mm) shows that the coated materials are
densely and continuously distributed with black-gray color. Also,
uniformly dispersed CNTs in the cathode electrode (Figure 2b3) may enhance
the conductivity to reduce the polarization of the battery and provide
electron tunneling for LiFePO4 to compensate the charge
balance during Li+ insertion and removal.39,40

The yarn-shaped anode electrode with natural graphite (Figures 2c1 and S2c,d) (diameter ∼0.83 mm) has a gloss
surface, which is possibly attributed to the presence of free electrons
in the graphite layer. It is observed that anode sheet layers (size
about 5–10 μm) are uniformly dispersed with little agglomeration
and have a porous structure (Figure 2c2,c3), which possibly contributes
to the overall large specific surface area and facilitates the diffusion
of Li+. In addition, the presence of elongated and electrically
conductive CNTs may result in a good conductive pathway between the
graphite sheets, which enhances the catalytic activity of the charge
transfer reaction.41Figure 2d1 indicates that the gel electrolyte
has little rough surface and uniform pore distribution, which may
lead to small surface pores of SSY@LFP@GE (cross-sectional diameter
∼0.95 mm) (Figure S3a) and high
specific surface area. Figure 2d2,d3 demonstrate the porous structure
of the prepared gel electrolyte (pore size ∼1 μm). This
porous structure (Figure S3b) of the GPE
may ensure lithium-ion conduction while preventing the passage of
electrode particles. An increased number of macropores enhances the
specific surface area of electrodes and provides more channels for
the transport of ions. In addition, the interpenetrating macroporous
structure can reduce the resistance of ion transport and polymer chain
scission migration while increasing the ionic conductivity.42

Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping
of the cathode electrode
SSY@LFP from the corresponding SEM image (Figure 3) revealed the existence and distribution
of various elements. In detail, Fe, P, and O elements from LiFePO4 and the C element from CNTs are well observed. In addition,
the even distribution of Fe, P, and O elements strongly indicates
that the cathode material is uniformly coated onto the surface of
the flexible SSY without severe agglomeration. The uniform distribution
of C elements further evidences that the uniform three-dimensional
network of CNTs is formed (Figure 2b3) and may retard the expansion process
of the electrodes in battery cycling.43

image of SSY@LFP and corresponding EDS mapping of C, O, Fe,
and P elements.

To verify the electrochemical
stability of the SSYs as current
collectors, electrochemical performance of these yarns will be discussed
in the section. As shown in Figure 4a, cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of SSYs in the voltage
range of 2.0–3.7 V imply no obvious redox peak at different
scan rates of 5, 10, 20, and 50 mV·s–1. Because
the SSYs are not involved in the electrochemical reaction of the electrodes
in the voltage range, their suitability as a flexible substrate for
a yarn-shaped LIB is confirmed.

of 2.0–3.7 V. Nyquist
plots of the yarn-shaped LIB from SSY@LFP@GE after (b) 1 and (c) 24
h of storage time, respectively.

The electrochemical performance of the gel electrolyte is scrutinized
by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The typical Nyquist
plots are composed of one semicircle in a high-frequency range and
a straight line in a low-frequency range. The radius of the semicircle
in the high-frequency region represents the impedance of the electrode,
namely, the impedance of lithium ions between the electrode and the
electrolyte interface in this work. The slope of the linear line in
the low-frequency region represents the ease of lithium-ion diffusion:
the steeper the slope of the line is, the easier the lithium-ion diffusion
is.44−46 As shown in Figures 4b,c, and S4a,b, Nyquist
plots of the gel electrolyte after 1 and 24 h of storage time show
typical characteristics, but the low-frequency slope of the gel electrolyte
after 1 h of storage is larger, indicating lower ion diffusion resistance.47 When comparing the high-frequency semicircle
of the gel electrolytes, it is clear that the radius of the gel electrolyte
stored for 1 h (296 Ω) is much smaller than that of the one
after 24 h of storage (5782 Ω), implying rapid electron transport
and low charge transport resistance of the newly prepared gel electrolyte.48 Moreover, the performance of the prepared gel electrolyte is time-sensitive,
possibly because of the volatilization of the plasticizer (EC/PC)
over time. Typically plasticizers play a multitude of roles in the
gel electrolyte such as reducing the crystallinity of the polymer
and the activation energy of ion transport, increasing the mobility
of the polymer segment and the concentration of free ions, promoting
the dissociation of lithium salts, and so forth.49 Thus, retaining the maximum plasticizer content is the
key to obtain the best electrochemical performance of the yarn-shaped
LIB.

The cycle performance is further examined in this section.
As shown
in Figure 5a, this
7 cm-long yarn-shaped LIB has a capacity of 0.45 mA h at 0.1 C. In
addition, in the discharge platform range of 3.1–3.2 V, the
battery has a voltage curve similar to that of the coin-type full
battery, which rationalizes the design principle of the yarn-shaped
LIB. With a cyclic charge/discharge analysis at 0.1 C (Figure 5b), the charging platform (3.4–3.55
V) and the discharging platform (3.0–3.2 V) indicate the typical
charge/discharge curve of the battery. The cyclic stability test of
the assembled yarn-shaped LIB at 0.2 C (Figure 5c) shows that the capacity retention is 42.78%
and the Coulombic efficiency remains 54.2% from the 1st cycle to the
50th cycle. During the charging process, the anode experiences volume
expansion, resulting in the generation of structural debris and new
surface area. The additionally formed solid electrolyte interface
(SEI) film will increase the amount of lithium-ion consumption. During
the discharging process of the battery, the structural debris that
have poor contact or have been detached from the conducting network
of the anode will not participate in the electrochemical reaction,
and these lithium ions are irreversibly lost. Therefore, Coulombic
efficiency is not very satisfactory. To better understand the cycling
capability of the yarn-shaped LIB, EIS measurements were performed
before the 1st and after the 50th charge/discharge cycle (Figure 5d). After 50 cycles,
the ionic and electronic conductivities of the yarn-shaped LIB are
reduced because the calculated impedance increases from 263.4 to 324.6
Ω and the linear slope of the low-frequency region is decreased.
It is possibly due to the occurrence of interfacial side reactions
inside the battery and SEI film formed on the surface of the electrode.50

To better verify the flexibility of the prepared
yarn-shaped LIB
which has an effective length of 7 cm and a diameter of 1.76 mm (Figure 6a), its electrochemical
performance at different states (normal, bent, and knotted) is demonstrated
(Figures 6b and S5). In the normal state, the assembled yarn-shaped
LIB has a discharge specific capacity of 55.8 mA h·g–1 at 0.1 C. Even being bent or knotted, the output specific capacity
of the assembled yarn-shaped LIB is still maintained above 85%. How
to maintain the stable capacity retention rate of the prepared yarn-shaped
LIB in the process of multiple bending or folding is still an important
issue to be solved in the future. The battery with good flexibility
(Figures 6c–f
and S6) offers the possibility of being
woven into fabrics (Figure 7a). In addition, the practical application of the assembled
yarn-shaped LIB is revealed. The charged yarn-shaped LIB under the
bending state successfully powers up an electronic watch (Figure 7b and Video S1) and an electronic thermo-hygrometer
(Figure 7c and Video S2) to enable them to work for 36.2 and
4.7 h, respectively. Comparison of the volumetric energy density and
specific capacity of this work with other reported yarn-shaped LIBs
is presented in Figure S7, and data about
the yarn-shaped battery are summarized in Table S1. The performance of the yarn-shaped LIB assembled from inexpensive
materials through a simple preparation process still needs to be further
improved.

Conclusions
In summary, this work
has demonstrated a novel SSY-based yarn-shaped
LIB with high flexibility and wearability. In addition, the gel electrolyte
rather than the liquid electrolyte was employed to avoid common safety
issues of the LIB such as high flammablility, explosivity, and leakage
during use. Even at different deformation conditions (i.e., bending
or knotting), the specific capacity of the yarn-shaped LIB (7 cm long,
<2 mm in diameter), assembled from graphite and lithium iron phosphate
electrodes, is maintained >85%. After charged treatment, it can
successfully
power up an electronic watch (36.2 h) and an electronic thermo-hygrometer
(4.7 h). Thanks to the simple preparation process, low cost in raw
materials, and good safety performance, and this work can promote
the commercialization of wearable energy storage devices.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) was purchased from Shenzhen Tianchenghe Technology Co., Ltd., China.
PC, EC, and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) were purchased
from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd., China. Lithium
tetrafluoroborate (LiBF4) was purchased from Shanghai Binlian
Industrial Co., Ltd., China. Acetone was purchased from Shanghai Lingfeng
Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China. Natural graphite was purchased
from Qingdao Yuxing Graphite Products Co., Ltd., China. PVDF-HFP (molecular
weight of 400,000) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Poly(vinylidene
fluoride) (PVDF, HSV900) was purchased from Arkema Ltd. Carbon nanotubes
(CNTs) were purchased from CNano Technology Ltd. Stainless steel two-ply
yarn was purchased from Shenzhen Guangrui New Materials Co., Ltd.

Preparation of Yarn-Shaped Electrodes
The flexible
substrate was braided with three SSYs. The anode and cathode materials
were deposited onto the SSYs by the dipping-drying method. SSYs coated
with graphite is the anode, referred as SSY@G. SSYs coated with LFP
is the cathode, referred as SSY@LFP. In detail, the electrode slurry
was prepared by magnetically stirring LiFePO4 or graphite,
PVDF, and CNTs in the NMP solvent at a mass ratio of 7.5:1.5:1 for
12 h at room temperature. Later, the well-dispersed solution was transferred
to a home-made mold with SSY immersed for 10 min and vacuum-dried
in an oven at 60 °C for 12 h.

Preparation of the Gel
Electrolyte
The dipping-drying
method was also employed in the preparation process of the gel electrolyte.
LiBF4 (0.125 g) was dissolved in 12.5 mL of the acetone
solvent by magnetically stirring the mixture at 48 °C for 2 h.
Then, the plasticizer solution consisting of EC (0.47 mL) and PC (0.53
mL) (EC/PC), together with PVDF-HFP (0.708 g), was added into the
previous solution by stirring the mixture for 12 h at 48 °C to
form a uniformly dispersed electrolyte solution. Later, the electrolyte
solution was transferred into a home-made mold to immerse the yarn-shaped
cathode and anode materials for 1 min. Then, the electrodes were taken
out and dried for 5 min. After repeating the immersion and drying
processes 20 times, the SSY@LFP coated with the gel electrolyte is
formed and named SSY@LFP@GE. The entire process is completed in a
glovebox with an inert nitrogen atmosphere to prevent the electrolyte
from reacting with water or oxygen.

Assembly of the Yarn-Shaped
Battery
Before the assembly,
the SSYs were ultrasonically cleaned with acetone bath for 30 min
with an ultrasonic cleaner (PS-40A, 40 kHz, Shenzhen Fukeda Ultrasonic
Equipment Co., Ltd.), then washed with deionized water to further
remove impurities on the surfaces, and finally oven-dried at 60 °C
for 1 h. The assembly of the yarn-shaped LIB is performed in the following
steps. The anode and cathode electrodes coated with the gel electrolyte
were first twisted by a self-made jig and then soaked in plasticizer
solution (EC/PC) at room temperature for 10 min. Later, the battery
core including the yarn-shaped cathode, anode, and gel electrolyte
was packed in a tube (TG001, diameter of 3 mm) which shrinks upon
heating at 100 °C by heating for 1 min. After sealing two ends
of the yarn-shaped LIB with a hot melt glue gun (EVA hot melt adhesive,
Foshan Yide Adhesive Co., Ltd), the assembled yarn-shaped battery
was placed in the glovebox for 24 h to complete preformation. The
7 cm-long yarn-shaped cathode has a loading mass of 40 mg, and the
anode has a loading mass of 20.3 mg. The N/P value is 1.1. The simplified operation process is shown
in Figure S1.

Characterizations
The surface morphologies of the anode,
cathode, and electrolyte were observed by optical microscopy (DM-XTL7045)
and SEM (FESEM, SU8010). EDS mapping was obtained to quantitatively
identify the elements in the cathode. The cross section of the yarn-shaped
battery was also imaged with optical microscopy (DM-XTL7045). The
voltage of the battery was measured with a multimeter (VC890C+). The
galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) measurements, rate performance
evaluation, and constant-capacity cycling tests were conducted using
a LAND battery testing system (CT2001A) at room temperature. EIS and
CV were performed by an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, Shanghai
Chenhua Instrument Co., Ltd.).
