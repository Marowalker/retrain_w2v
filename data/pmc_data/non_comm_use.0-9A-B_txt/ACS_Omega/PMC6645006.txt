Although graphene-enhanced
Raman spectroscopy has been investigated
for several years, there have been no studies that have applied it
to real-time observations of chemical catalytic reactions. Here, we
report that UV/ozone-treated oxidized graphene was used to both control
and monitor the photoreduction of an adsorbed nitroaromatic dye compound.
Graphene-enhanced Raman spectroscopy studies show that more oxidized
graphene surface leads to faster photoreduction. This is due to the
lowering of the Fermi level in the oxidized graphene, which is in
agreement with the highest occupied molecular orbital level of the
adsorbed dye molecule, leading to a rapid electron transfer from graphene
to the dye. Our findings will be useful in understanding and exploiting
the photocatalytic properties of oxidized graphene on adsorbed molecular
species.

Introduction
Graphene is one of the famous two-dimensional
(2D) materials and
has a tremendous impact on a variety of fields, including electronics,
physics, materials science, and chemistry.1,2 Its
superior optical and electronic properties offer the potential for
use as a next-generation photocatalyst.3−8 Highly conjugated π electrons of graphene are also useful
for the adsorption of foreign molecules (reactants in catalyst process)
via π–π interaction.

Vibrational spectroscopic
fingerprint of molecules gives abundant
information about molecular geometric structure, degree of charged
state, and interaction with the substrates.9,10 Among
the various methods, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is
one of the powerful tools to detect the analytes even down to the
single-molecule limit when situated near the nanostructure of novel
metals. Thus, much efforts have been made to explore this phenomenon.11,12 Compared to conventional SERS, using a metal as a Raman signal enhancer,
graphene-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (GERS) has recently attracted
interest since just a single layer of graphene was allowed to exhibit
the apparent Raman signal of the adsorbed dye, although its enhancement
mechanism is still debated.13−28 Most studies regarding GERS fall into two categories. One is revealing
the origin of enhancement mechanism, and the other is the real application
to detect the analytes of interest. However, application of GERS to
monitor the chemical reaction has not been explored to date.

Nitroaromatic compounds are important because they are widely used
in various industrial fields such as organic dyes and explosive materials,
but they are known to cause serious environmental pollution.29 Very recently, we have reported that single-layer
graphene can be used to catalyze the photoinduced reduction of a nitroaromatic
dye compound without a photosensitizer like TiO2, which
was revealed by GERS.30 The proposed mechanism
involves the fast electron transfer from graphene to empty highest
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) states of photoexcited dye molecules.
Also, we compared the Raman spectral changes in various graphene dye
structures and revealed that the ambient hydrogen source, which is
needed for photoreduction, can be effectively blocked by sandwiching
graphene layers.

Here, we demonstrate that GERS is useful for
revealing the rate
control of photoreduction occurring on oxidized graphene. Our results
demonstrate the realization of controlled catalytic performance of
oxidized graphene on an adsorbed nitroaromatic dye compounds.

Experimental
Section
The chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-based synthetic
method of graphene
was fully described in a previous paper.30 Briefly, graphene was CVD-synthesized on a high-purity copper foil
(Alfa Aesar, 99.999%) with flowing  5 sccm H2 and  45 sccm CH4 gas. After spin-coating one
side of graphene with poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), back-side
graphene was etched using oxygen plasma. Then, the PMMA layer on graphene
was removed by acetone. The remaining copper was etched in 1.8 wt
% ammonium persulfate solution. Finally, the monolayer graphene was
rinsed with distilled water several times. After washed graphene was
laid on a Si/SiO2 (300 nm) wafer, the samples were treated
using a conventional UV/ozone cleaner (Bioforce) for 5 and 10 min,
respectively, before sample loading and Raman measurements. Disperse
red 1 (DR1, Aldrich, 95%) was used as received. Each graphene sample
on a silicon piece is dipped into the ethanolic solution of DR1 (200
μM) for more than 30 min and then washed with copious ethanol
and deionized water to remove the unbounded molecules. A 514.5 nm
laser light of 0.5 mW (or 532 nm of 2 mW) was irradiated onto the
sample surface to measure Raman signals and to drive photoreduction
simultaneously.30 Back-scattered Raman
signals were measured using the commercialized Raman model (Renishaw
inVia RM 1000 (514.5 nm, 2400 grooves/mm) or Witec Alpha 300
(532 nm, 600 grooves/mm)).

Results
Figure 1 shows a
schematic diagram of the change of the Fermi level in graphene induced
by UV/ozone treatment. For the pristine single-layer graphene, the
position of the Fermi level is close to the Dirac point. It is well
known that CVD-synthesized and transferred graphene exhibits a slightly
p-doped state caused by captured water underneath the graphene during
the wet transfer process or by the left residue of PMMA used as a
supporting polymer. UV/ozone exposure induces further lowering of
the Fermi level in graphene. The generated oxygen-containing functionality
is believed to draw the electrons from the graphene. This is already
confirmed by the change of the Dirac point value in graphene-field
effect transistor in a previous work in our lab.31 When the adsorbed DR1 was excited with incident resonant
light, empty HOMO states were temporarily generated in photoexcited
DR1. Then, since the electrons are rich and ultrafast in graphene,
the empty hole in the HOMO level of photoexcited DR1 was filled with
electrons from the adjacent graphene. Considering the intrinsic energy
level of the HOMO and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital)  in DR1,32,33 the Fermi level of the oxidized
graphene came close to the state of HOMO in DR1 due to the p-doping
on graphene, as shown in Figure 1a. This means that more oxidized graphene leads to
more easy transfer of electrons to DR1, resulting in a fast photoreduction
of DR1 on graphene.

Figure 1 (a) Schematic diagram showing electron transfer from lowered
Fermi
level in oxidized graphene to HOMO in photoexcited dye (DR1: disperse
red 1). (b) Photoinduced reduction of nitro-disperse red 1 to amino-disperse
red 1 on graphene surface.

Raman spectrum of graphene is commonly used to represent
its electronic
state noninvasively. Figure 2 shows the change of Raman spectrum of graphene according
to the UV/ozone exposure time. Before any treatment, Raman spectrum
(bottom) shows a typical spectral feature of the pristine graphene.
The 2D peak has an ideal Lorentzian shape, and the signal ratio between
G and 2D peaks is 3 ∼ 4, both of which verify the
existence of pristine single-layered graphene. After 5 min of treatment,
the D peak starts to appear and becomes more prominent after 10 min.
As the oxidation occurs on graphene by UV/ozone treatment, the sp2 network in graphene starts to be destroyed. Thus, the D/G
peak ratio along with the bandwidth of the 2D peak also increases
with increasing UV/ozone treatment time.31 This has been already confirmed experimentally in a previous work.

characterization of graphene with UV/ozone treatment time.

Disperse red
1 (DR1) dye molecules were subject to be adsorbed
onto each substrate (0, 5, and 10 min of UV/ozone treatment), and
Raman measurements were conducted. Figure 3 shows the apparent Raman spectrum of DR1
adsorbed on graphene. Irradiation was carried out using a 514.5 nm
laser, and the background spectrum, which is believed to be originated
from the fluorescence of the dye, was significantly quenched due to
the ultrafast charge carrier in graphene. The peaks at 1103, 1134,
1194, 1334, 1387, 1422, 1444, and 1588 cm–1 can
be assigned to δ(C–H), ν(C–N), δ(C–H),
ν(N–O), ν(N=N), ν(C–C), ν(C–C),
and ν(C–C) in the DR1 dye, respectively. One notable
point is the increase of GERS of the dye signal with UV/ozone exposure
time. All Raman bands from the dye exhibit increase in intensity with
UV/ozone treatment. This is already mentioned in a previous paper
that the induced dipole from the generated oxygen functionality might
attribute to the enhanced GERS signal.31 The more interesting point is the time-resolved Raman signal during
laser irradiation at each single substrate. We note that the relative
intensity of the peaks at 1334 cm–1 (nitro group)
compared to the one of the first-order phonon peaks in silicon shows
different decrease phenomena with irradiation time, and it is observed
that more fast enhancement is observed in more UV/ozone-treated graphene.
This is clearly shown in Figure 4. As already mentioned, during the photoreduction reaction,
the peak of the nitro group at 1334 cm–1 from nitro-DR1
decreases while the peak of the amine group at 1121 cm–1 from amino-DR1 increases simultaneously.30 Therefore, the peak decrease at 1334 cm–1 indicates
the occurrence of a degree of photoreduction reaction.

Conclusions
In summary, we spectroscopically
investigated the controlled photoreduction
reaction occurring on oxidized graphene using the nitroaromatic dye
compound. More oxidized graphene has been found to induce fast photoreduction
of the dye, which is attributed to the lowering of the Fermi level
of oxidized graphene, leading to fast electron transfer from graphene
to the dye. Our findings provide a better understanding of graphene
in terms of photocatalyst and also an easy way to control the catalytic
performance on the adsorbed molecular species without any photosensitizers.
In addition, other types of plasma treatments, such as nitrogen and
argon, can produce different types of two-dimensional materials with
desired catalytic performance.
