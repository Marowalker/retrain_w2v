A relatively
high-affinity inhibitor
of FIKK kinase from the malaria parasite Plasmodium
vivax was identified by in vitro assay of recombinant
kinase. The FIKK kinase family is unique to parasitic organisms of
the Apicomplexan order and has been shown to be critical in malaria
parasites. The recombinant kinase domain was expressed and screened
against a small molecule library, revealing a number of tyrosine kinase
inhibitors that block FIKK kinase activity. A family of tyrphostins
was further investigated, to begin exploring the FIKK kinase pharmacophore.
Finally, emodin was identified as a relatively high-affinity FIKK
kinase inhibitor, identifying this family of anthraquinones as potential
lead compounds for the development of antimalarials targeting the
FIKK kinase.

==== Body
Introduction
All members of the phylum Apicomplexa,
which includes malaria parasites,
have at least one FIKK kinase.1 Indeed,
FIKK kinases are a rather prominent feature of the genome of malaria
parasites.2−4 However, their function in the complex life cycle
of the malaria parasite is unclear. Plasmodium falciparum, the species that causes the most deadly form of human malaria,
secretes 17 different FIKK kinases into its host red blood cell, suggesting
a role in the blood stages of infection. In vitro secreted FIKK kinases
have been shown to phosphorylate human dematin, a cytoskeletal protein
of the red blood cell.5 Likewise, knockout
of individual secreted kinases affects erythrocyte rigidity, further
implying a role in cytoskeletal alteration.6,7 However,
in Plasmodium berghei, a species of
malaria parasite that infects rodents, knockout of the FIKK kinase
resulted in dramatically slowed growth in the intrahepatocytic stage,
along with impaired sporozoite production.8Plasmodium vivax, the parasite responsible
for most cases of human malaria worldwide, has a single FIKK kinase
but is not amenable to genetic manipulation. For this reason, development
of a pharmacological inhibitor could provide an important tool for
probing its importance to this species of malaria parasite. Because
other members of the Apicomplexan family, including the disease-causing
parasite Cryptosporidium parvum, have
a FIKK kinase homolog, inhibitors of this enzyme have the potential
to shed light on the physiology of a variety of human pathogens.

In addition to their role in parasite biology, FIKK kinases are
unusual members of the protein kinase superfamily. As a class, protein
kinases have a number of highly conserved sequence motifs related
to their function.9 However, FIKK kinases
lack a number of these conserved sequence features. The FIKK kinase
from P. vivax (PvFIKK) is a non-RD
kinase, lacking the Arg-Asp sequence that typically responds to phosphorylation
of the kinase activation loop.10 In addition,
although most FIKK kinases share the metal-binding DFG loop, this
signature is absent in the PvFIKK sequence, with only the Asp itself
seemingly conserved. FIKK kinases in general lack the GxGxϕG
motif, a stretch of amino acids that typically makes up the back of
the ATP-binding site.11,12 Finally, a comparison of the
amino acid sequences of the FIKK kinase family from P. falciparum, as well as the single FIKK kinases
from P. vivax, P. berghei, and C. parvum, shows that they mostly
have a small, polar amino acid side chain as the “gatekeeper”
residue, controlling access to the ATP-binding site (Figure 1). The typical Ser/Thr gatekeeper
residue is a large, hydrophobic residue, and only about 10% of eukaryotic
Ser/Thr kinases have a similarly small, polar residue in this position.13 This stands in contrast to tyrosine kinases,
which typically do have small, polar gatekeeper residues. One reason
this distinction is important is that the identity of the gatekeeper
residue has been shown to affect the types of molecules that can inhibit
a given kinase.14,15 Individually, none of these deviations
from canonical kinase motifs is unique to the FIKK kinase, but the
fact that they are all seen in a single protein suggests that this
is an unusual member of the kinase family.

a variety of FIKK kinases, showing conservation
of a small gatekeeper residue (shaded), more typical of eukaryotic
tyrosine than serine/threonine kinases.

This work identifies small molecule inhibitors of the FIKK
kinase
from P. vivax, the parasite responsible
for most human malaria. The potency of these inhibitors is relatively
low, rendering them primarily useful as lead compounds that provide
a scaffold for further development into truly potent and selective
inhibitors. The identification of potent and selective FIKK kinase
inhibitors would provide a tool for studying this enzyme’s
role in parasite physiology, through pharmacological manipulation.
In addition, characterizing the pharmacophore of these unusual Ser/Thr
kinases may expand our knowledge of the kinds of molecules that bind
and inhibit eukaryotic kinases in general, particularly those with
unusual structural features.

Results
Recombinant expression of
some plasmodial FIKK kinases has been
previously demonstrated, namely, active full-length PfFIKK4.1, along
with kinase domains from PfFIKK4.1 and PfFIKK8 and the nonsecreted
FIKK kinase from P. berghei.2,5,8,16 Here,
the kinase domain of P. vivax FIKK
kinase (PvFIKK) was expressed and purified for the first time. The
recombinant protein is an active kinase, phosphorylating both dematin
(a human red blood cell cytoskeletal protein previously identified
as a PfFIKK4.1 substrate) and itself. Its activity was monitored through
the use of the phospho-specific protein stain, Pro-Q Diamond (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Protein gel of the kinase domain from P. vivax FIKK kinase (PvFIKK) heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. Staining with both Sypro Ruby (stains
all proteins) and Pro-Q Diamond (stains phosphoproteins) reveals that
the recombinant kinase domain is active and phosphorylates itself
(autophosphorylation), as well as recombinant human dematin, a known
substrate of FIKK kinases.

The recent discovery of a peptide motif that can be phosphorylated
by FIKK kinases allowed the development of a plate reader-based enzyme-coupled
optical assay, providing continuous kinetic monitoring.16 Because PvFIKK has a tyrosine kinase-like gatekeeper
residue, we theorized that Tyr kinase inhibitors may be effective
against the enzyme. We used the enzyme-coupled assay to test a small
family of tyrphostins, known as Tyr kinase inhibitors17 (Figure 3). This assay identified compounds with the ability to inhibit PvFIKK.
The dose–response curves showed clear differences among the
family members, where tyrphostin 47 was the most potent of the compounds
tested. This compound is significantly more effective than tyrphostin
46, in spite of their great chemical similarity. It was not possible,
in this assay, to achieve saturating concentrations of tyrphostins
because they absorb significantly at the analyte wavelength of 340
nm. In the absence of these saturating concentrations, IC50 for tyrphostin 47 can only be estimated to be approximately 100
μM.

Figure 3 Continuous, colorimetric enzyme-coupled assay demonstrates differential
inhibition of recombinant PvFIKK by various tyrphostins, a class of
tyrosine kinase inhibitor.

The ultraviolet absorption of potential inhibitors at 340
nm makes
a non-absorbance-based assay attractive for screening of inhibitors
that need to be applied at relatively high concentration. Using human
dematin as the substrate, a radioisotope-based filter-binding assay
was adapted to quantify phosphorylation of the protein target via
liquid scintillation counting. This endpoint assay was used to assess
the ability of compounds from an 84-compound library of known kinase
inhibitors to inhibit PvFIKK at a fixed concentration of 1 mM. Assigning
an arbitrary cutoff of 70% inhibition for both replicates revealed
three compounds (emodin, CGP 57380, and bisindolylmaleimide VII) with
apparent ability to block PvFIKK activity, noting that this collection
of compounds does not include tyrphostins (Figure 4). These three compounds are all known to
inhibit tyrosine kinases (emodin has been shown to inhibit both classes
of kinase).18,19 Returning to the enzyme-coupled
assay for validation of the results of the screen, selected compounds
were retested (Figure 5). To rule out false positives, the three compounds emerging from
the screen were tested. To test for false negatives, a selection of
compounds that were not effective in the filter-binding assay were
tested. Generally, the enzyme-coupled assay validated the results
of the radioisotope assay in that the three compounds emerging from
the screen reduced residual PvFIKK activity to less than 50%, at a
concentration 10-fold less than that of the filter-binding assay.
Likewise, compounds that were ineffective in the filter-binding assay
left PvFIKK activity within 90% of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-treated
enzyme. In addition to these compounds from the screen, the tyrphostins
were included, along with a bisindolylmaleimide not included in the
initial screen. Of the compounds validated as potential PvFIKK inhibitors,
emodin appeared the most effective at concentrations below 100 μM.
A dose–response curve for emodin showed that it inhibits PvFIKK
at a concentration of 1.9 ± 0.7 mM (Figure 6). Data for this dose–response curve
were collected over six independent trials, performed by different
individuals with different preparations of recombinant PvFIKK.

Discussion
The kinases of pathogens have often been proposed
as potential
drug targets.20 Interfering with signal
transduction has strong potential to render parasites harmless, either
killing them outright, inhibiting their growth, or interfering with
their ability to infect. Of course, our own cells also rely on kinases
for signal transduction, so any drug that targets a parasite kinase
must be specific, to avoid affecting its human host. Malaria parasites
are eukaryotes, so their set of kinases has a great deal of overlap
with our own. However, one family of kinases shared by all malaria
parasites has rather distinctive features. These kinases are referred
to as FIKK kinases, after a four amino acid Phe-Ile-Lys-Lys sequence
motif that they hold in common.2−4 Most malaria parasites have a
single FIKK kinase, and it has been shown to be functionally important
in P. berghei, a rodent malaria that
serves as a genetically manipulable model for the genus.8 On the other hand, knockout of the FIKK kinase
from the related parasite Toxoplasma gondii does not affect parasite growth.21 Likewise,
the recent discovery of an inhibitor for C. parvum FIKK kinase shows that parasites treated with this inhibitor survive.22 Pharmacological tools to block the activity
of the plasmodial FIKK kinase may then be helpful in resolving the
question of which plasmodial FIKK kinases are essential. Globally,
most human malaria cases result from infection by the species P. vivax.23 We report
here the identification of emodin, a plant-derived anthraquinone,
as a relatively high-affinity inhibitor of the FIKK kinase from P. vivax (PvFIKK).24

All protein kinases must bind two substrates, ATP and their peptide
target of phosphorylation. A typical kinase ATP-binding site is characterized
by a glycine-containing motif (GxGxxG) that makes backbone hydrogen
bonds to the β- and γ-phosphates of ATP and a residue
at the back of the binding site that interacts with the exocyclic
amine (N6) of the adenine nucleobase.9,11 The identity
of the latter residue has been shown to control the inhibitors that
are able to bind in the ATP-binding site, so it is referred to as
the gatekeeper.15 This gatekeeper residue
is a large, hydrophobic residue in ∼90% of eukaryotic Ser/Thr
kinases and a small, polar residue in most tyrosine kinases.13 The FIKK kinase family is unusual in both regards.
First, it lacks a recognizable GxGxxG motif. Second, it has a tyrosine
kinase-like gatekeeper residue, despite being a Ser/Thr kinase (Figure 1). In addition to
these two alterations to the ATP-binding site, FIKK kinases are unusual
Ser/Thr kinases in that they lack two signatures associated with activation
by phosphorylation. They are the so-called non-RD kinases, lacking
the conserved Arg residue that would typically stabilize a phosphoserine
or phosphothreonine in the activation loop.10 Second, the family of FIKK kinases lacks a strong consensus activation
loop.12 Because of these differences between
typical eukaryotic Ser/Thr kinases, it may be possible to develop
inhibitors that specifically target the FIKK kinase, while not interfering
with host kinases.

Within the genus Plasmodium, the kinase domains
of FIKK kinases
are fairly highly conserved.1−4 There is 84.5% sequence identity between P. vivax FIKK kinase and its closest homolog P. falciparum FIKK8. Across the Order Apicomplexa,
there is somewhat less conservation. For example, the Cryptosporidium and P. vivax FIKK kinase domains
are 38% identical. The FIKK kinases also have a large N-terminal domain
of unknown function that is much less highly conserved. Another feature
of the plasmodial FIKK kinases is that the family has undergone tremendous
expansion in P. falciparum and some
related species that infect higher primates so that there are 21 different
PfFIKK kinases, almost all of which have an export signal.

The
experimental approach taken here to identify potential FIKK
inhibitors was to purify a recombinant version of the kinase domain
of PvFIKK and then screen a library of small molecule kinase inhibitors.
There is precedent for the recombinant expression of full-length FIKK
kinases from P. falciparum and FIKK
kinase domains from P. falciparum, P. berghei, and C. parvum, another disease-causing member of the Apicomplexan order.5,8,16 This strategy has been effective
in identifying inhibitors for the CpFIKK and PbFIKK kinases.8,16 However, this is the first reported expression of P. vivax FIKK kinase. The PvFIKK kinase domain expressed
and purified from E. coli was shown
to be active against itself (autophosphorylation) and against a known
FIKK kinase substrate, human dematin (Figure 2). Almost all Ser/Thr kinases autophosphorylate,
but almost all Ser/Thr kinases have the RD motif and a recognizable
activation loop.25 The physiological role
of autophosphorylation in a kinase like PvFIKK that lacks these features
is not clear. Autophosphorylation does not appear to have an effect
on PvFIKK activity in our assay. Osman et al. noted that they coexpressed
FIKK8 from P. falciparum with phosphatase,
to avoid autophosphorylation, and then preincubated the kinase with
ATP prior to substrate addition.16 In these
experiments, we did not
observe a noticeable difference in activity before and after incubation.
It is possible that the observed autophosphorylation is not physiologically
relevant, but it could also be the case that it has a role that would
not be evident in these experiments, such as involvement in subcellular
localization. The use of human dematin as a PvFIKK substrate is based
on the observation that, like other FIKK, it will readily phosphorylate
this protein.5 Dematin is a protein of
the red blood cell cytoskeleton, and there is no evidence that PvFIKK
is exported. So, there is no a priori reason to believe that dematin
is a physiologically important substrate of PvFIKK. It was used here
as a convenient protein substrate.

Because of PvFIKK’s
tyrosine kinase-like gatekeeper residue,
we wondered whether tyrosine kinase inhibitors might potentially bind.
We chose a small family of tyrphostins, known as Tyr kinase inhibitors,
for assessment.17 The assay was an enzyme-coupled
determination of PvFIKK’s ability to phosphorylate a Ser residue
in a small peptide previously identified as a PfFIKK8 substrate.18 As with dematin, PvFIKK is able to use this
substrate, but no physiological relevance is imputed to it. A range
of dose–response was observed among this small family of tyrphostins
(Figure 3). The α-cyano
nitriles had practically no effect in druglike concentrations (under
250 μM), regardless of the pattern of cinnamyl ring hydroxylation.
However, α-amido nitriles were much more effective. Because
these compounds are rather strongly colored, their absorption at 340
nm greatly complicates their use in the enzyme-coupled optical assay,
particularly at the high concentrations needed to achieve saturation.
Thus, IC50 can only be estimated, but the thioamide is
clearly the most effective inhibitor in this family, with an apparent
IC50 of roughly 100 μM.

Encouraged by the identification
of tyrphostin 47 as a reasonably
effective PvFIKK inhibitor, we obtained a library of small molecule
kinase inhibitors containing both Ser/Thr and Tyr kinase inhibitors.
Using a filter-binding assay with human dematin as substrate and with
radioisotopes providing signal, we screened this 84-compound library
for compounds with the ability to inhibit PvFIKK (Figure 4). To be as inclusive as possible,
the screening was carried out at an inhibitor concentration of 1 mM.
The three most effective compounds in this screen were annotated as
tyrosine kinase inhibitors, with the exception of emodin, which has
been reported to inhibit both Ser/Thr and Tyr kinases.18,19 To validate the results of this screen, we retested a number of
compounds from the screen using an enzyme-coupled assay.

At
an inhibitor concentration of 100 μM, the results of the
filter-binding screen were generally validated (Figure 5). Compounds identified as active in the
filter-binding assay reduced the activity of PvFIKK to less than 50%
of the uninhibited value. Those compounds judged not to be active
in the filter-binding assay served as a negative control in this assay,
leaving the treated activity within 90% of the DMSO-treated activity.
The tyrphostin family and a bisindolylmaleimide not found in the screen
were also assessed in this assay. In another validation step, the
three compounds emerging from the screen were assessed for their ability
to inhibit PvFIKK at concentrations closer to 10 μM. In this
screen, emodin appeared to be most active.

A dose–response
curve for PvFIKK activity in the presence
of emodin gives an IC50 of 1.9 ± 0.7 μM (Figure 6). Although not sufficiently
potent for use as an inhibitor immediately, the emodin architecture
may constitute a useful starting point for synthesizing analogues
with increased potency and selectivity. Emodin (CAS 518-82-1, PubChem
CID: 3220) is a hydroxylated anthraquinone produced by a number of
plant species.24 Its physiological role
in plants is not known, but plants that contain the compound have
found their way into a number of traditional pharmacopeias. As the
name suggests, emodin has traditionally been used as an emetic. More
recent investigations into the clinical efficacy of emodin have shown
it to inhibit both Ser/Thr and Tyr kinases and to act as a phytoestrogen.18,19,26 Indeed, emodin’s bioactivity
led to its inclusion in the LOPAC1280 library of pharmacologically
active compounds. This library has been screened against seven strains
of P. falciparum in human blood culture,
with the finding that emodin’s efficacy against P. falciparum strains was mixed.27 In three of the seven, emodin showed antimalarial activity,
but results from the other four strains were inconclusive. Although
the effectiveness of emodin against some strains of P. falciparum is suggestive, it is important to note
that the ability of P. falciparum to
compensate for the inhibition of FIKK kinase activity may be much
greater than that of P. vivax. Unlike P. vivax and most other malaria parasite species,
which have a single FIKK kinase, the more virulent P. falciparum species has 19 different FIKK kinases.
Because P. vivax cannot be cultured
in the laboratory setting, the effect of emodin on parasite survival
is difficult to gauge.

The single-celled organisms of the Apicomplexan
order include all
malaria parasites. The FIKK kinase specific to these organisms has
a number of distinctive features, making it a plausible drug target.
We expressed the kinase domain of the FIKK kinase from P. vivax and screened it against a small molecule
library, identifying the first reported inhibitors of the FIKK kinase
family. The anthraquinone emodin inhibits PvFIKK kinase with relatively
good (micromolar) affinity, establishing it as a potential lead compound
for the development of selective inhibitors targeting the FIKK kinase.

Materials
and Methods
Expression and Purification of Recombinant FIKKPvFIKK Kinase
Domain in E. coli
The sequence
of the P. vivax FIKK kinase was obtained
from the PlasmoDB database (http://plasmodb.org, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA).28 An E. coli-harmonized gene
corresponding to the sequence between residues EKQIK... and ...SCKLQ
was synthesized (Biomatik, Wilmington, DE) and subcloned into the
pHAT2 bacterial expression vector (M. Hyvönen, Cambridge University,
Cambridge, U.K.) using NcoI/XhoI.
This expression vector encodes an N-terminal 6His tag.29

The T7 Express strain (NEB, Beverly, MA)
was chosen for the production of recombinant protein in E. coli. A 20 mL overnight culture of T7 Express
cells transformed with the kinase domain of PvFIKK kinase in pHAT2
was inoculated from a glycerol stock in LB media containing ampicillin
(100 mg/mL). This overnight culture was used to inoculate 1 L of medium
(LB with 100 mg/mL ampicillin in both cases). The culture was grown
at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm until OD600 = 0.375.
The temperature of the incubator was reduced to 20 °C. After
10–20 min, IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.7 mM.
Overnight induction at 20 °C with shaking was followed by harvesting
of the cells as above.

The frozen cell pellet was thawed in
lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES
pH 7.0, 1 M NaCl, 10 mM imidazole). Cell lysis was facilitated by
probe-tip sonication, followed by clarification of the lysate by centrifugation
at 34 000g, 4 °C, 50 min. The lysate
was either loaded onto a 5 mL Profinity IMAC column (BioRad, Hercules,
CA), typically at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min, or bound in batches to
the same resin. Nonspecifically bound proteins were removed with wash
buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole) and the
protein eluted in high imidazole (20 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 500 mM NaCl,
250 mM imidazole). The fractions containing the highest protein concentration
were pooled, where the concentration was determined by absorbance
at 280 nm, measured by NanoDrop UV–vis spectrophotometer (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE). The pooled eluant from the nickel
column was loaded onto a preparative gel filtration column (Sephacryl
S-200 16/60, GE Biosciences) and eluted at a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min
with 20 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol. The fractions
corresponding to the appropriate monomeric
molecular weight (50 kDa) were pooled and concentrated with a 4 mL
capacity, 10 kDa cutoff centrifugal concentrator (Vivaspin 6, Sartorius,
Göttingen, Germany). To provide a negative control, a mutant
predicted to be inactive was prepared by changing a conserved active
site Asp to Asn (..SHLDLTPENIL.. to..SHLNLTPENIL..). This kinase-dead mutant was expressed and
purified under the same conditions as the wild-type kinase domain.
A plasmid for bacterial expression of a modified dematin was the kind
gift of Dr. James McKnight (Boston University School of Medicine,
Boston, MA).30

Assessment of Kinase Activity
by Phospho-Specific Staining
The homogeneity of the purified
PvFIKK kinase domain was assessed
by a sensitive total protein stain (Sypro Ruby, Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In addition,
ratiometric analysis of staining by the phospho-specific dye Pro-Q
relative to Sypro Ruby staining provides a means of assessing the
extent of phosphorylation catalyzed by recombinant PvFIKK kinase.
The kinase domain alone or with recombinant human dematin at 1 mg/mL
each (approximately 20 mM for PvFIKK and 15 mM for dematin) was incubated
at 30 °C for 30 min in a 10 mL volume. The reaction was quenched
by the addition of 2× sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gel-loading
buffer, and 15 mL was loaded onto a polyacrylamide gel for SDS-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis. According to the manufacturer’s long protocol,
the gel was treated and then stained with Pro-Q Diamond and imaged
(Typhoon FLA 7000 IP, GE Biosciences). The gel was then further stained
with Sypro Ruby.

Analysis of Kinase Activity by Enzyme-Coupled
Assay
Following Osman et al., an enzyme-coupled assay for
PvFIKK was set
up using a PK/LDH couple and a 10-mer peptide shown to be a PfFIKK8
substrate (RRRAPSFYRK, Biomatik, Wilmington, DE).16 The kinase buffer was 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl,
and 10 mM MgCl2. In a 50 μL reaction, 3 μL
of coupling enzyme was added (pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase
P0294, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). An enzyme concentration of 1
μM
was determined to be in the linear response range at fixed ATP, NADH,
PEP, and peptide concentrations (1, 200, 2, and 500 mM, respectively).
Where desired, 5 μL of inhibitor was added at the indicated
concentration, in up to 50% DMSO, for a final concentration of up
to 5% of the total reaction volume. A small effect on enzyme activity
was observed at 10% DMSO, but not at 5% and below. For medium throughput,
a Sunrise microplate reader was employed, set to a constant temperature
of 37 °C (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland). Reaction conditions
were established that produced slopes that were reproducible to within
5%, using 50 μL of reactions in half-area UV-transmitting 96-well
plates (Greiner Bio-One, Monroe, NC). As a negative control, the kinase-dead
version of the PvFIKK kinase domain was used at the same concentration
as the wild-type domain. No activity above background hydrolysis of
NADH was observed when using the kinase-inactive mutant. With some
inhibitors, elevated concentrations interfered with the assay by absorbing
strongly at 340 nm. For these inhibitors, the enzyme-coupled assay
was not able to be used to accurately assess enzyme behavior at saturating
inhibitor concentrations.

Filter-Binding Assay
To screen an
entire compound library
(Kinase Screening Library 10505, Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor
MI), a filter-binding assay was designed, closely following the recommendations
of Cohen et al.31 In a 10 mL volume, 1
mM purified PvFIKK was mixed with 40 mM purified human dematin–GST
fusion protein in a kinase buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl,
10 mM MgCl2). To initiate the reaction, ATP was added to
a final concentration of 100 mM, from a 250 mM stock solution that
was supplemented with γ-32P-ATP to approximately
1 × 105 cpm (EasyTide, 3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer).
When desired, 1 mL of inhibitor was added (in up to 50% DMSO) to a
final concentration of 1 mM. The reaction was incubated at 30 °C
for 10 min and then quenched by pipetting onto 2.5 cm radius filter
circles of either P81 phosphocellulose or nitrocellulose paper (Whatman,
GE Life Sciences), followed by immediate immersion in 75 mM phosphoric
acid. After two 5 min washes in a large volume of fresh 75 mM phosphoric
acid, the filter circles were treated with acetone and then air-dried.
For scintillation counting, the dried filter circles were placed into
scintillation vials without scintillation fluid and counted directly
(Beckman GS2500, GMI). Each condition was replicated, and the background-corrected
reading in counts per minute was normalized to the inhibitor-free
condition.

Validation of Screening by Enzyme-Coupled
Assay
Compounds
identified as potential inhibitors of PvFIKK protein kinase activity
from the filter-binding assay were retested against peptide in the
previously described enzyme-coupled assay. In addition, a selection
of compounds (H-89, hypericin, SMI4a, CAY10621, PP242, erlotinib,
and NU7026) with no apparent activity in the filter-binding assay
was assessed, to screen for false negatives. Whereas compounds were
screened in the filter-binding assay at a 1 mM concentration, validation
was carried out at a concentration of 100 μM. Results were generally
quite consistent between the two screens, despite differences in methodology
and substrate (the recombinant human cytoskeletal protein dematin
versus a 10 amino acid peptide optimized as a PfFIKK8 substrate).
