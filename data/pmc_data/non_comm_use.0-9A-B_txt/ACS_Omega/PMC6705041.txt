The multimolecular complexes formed
between 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzitane
(CL-20) and nitropyrazole compounds were investigated using B3LYP-D3/6-311G(d,p)
and B97-3c methods. CL-20 in these complexes was surrounded by methyl,
nitro, and amino derivatives of 4-nitropyrazole. The influence of
substituents on the molecular electrostatic potential distribution
of nitropyrazoles was investigated to figure out the potential electrostatic
interaction sites. For the complex, the O···H hydrogen
bond was popular in the intermolecular interactions, and dispersion
interaction played an essential role, especially in Cx/CL-20 multimolecular complexes. Trigger bond analysis showed that
their strength increased upon the formation of intermolecular weak
interactions. Nitro group charge calculations stated that the negative
charge on almost all nitro groups showed a significant increase. Therefore,
the sensitivity of CL-20 seemed to be lower than the original. In
addition, the transfer of electron density between CL-20 and nitropyrzoles
in complexes was investigated, revealing the influence of weak interactions
on the electron density of CL-20.

1 Introduction
At present, 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzitane
(CL-20) is one of high-energy single-compound explosives, but its
application is greatly limited due to the poor safety performance
caused by high sensitivity. Thus, the general methods for reducing
the sensitivity of CL-20 plagued the majority of researchers in the
field of energetic materials. Until now, many methods have been proposed,
such as improving crystal quality, physical coating, adding a desensitizer,
cocrystallization, and casting technology.1−4 In these methods, cocrystallization,
combining two or more neutral species via intermolecular weak interactions,
is a powerful technology to reduce the sensitivity without consuming
excessive energy. Besides, the crystals are widely used in the large
field, such as nonlinear optical (NLO) materials.5,6 Although
many CL-20-based cocrystals7−11 have been obtained since Bolton et al. prepared a CL-20/2,4,6-trinitrotoluene
(TNT) cocrystal in 2011,12 the preparation
of CL-20-based cocrystals is still very difficult due to the complex
formation mechanism. Therefore, screening and researching coformers
of CL-20 using computational chemical methods is a convenient and
low-cost strategy.

Up to now, many molecular dynamics studies
on the formation of
cocrystals between CL-20 and other energetic molecules have been published.
The CL-20/dihydroxylammonium 5,50-bistetrazole-1,10-diolate (TKX-50)
cocrystal was investigated theoretically, and analysis results illuminated
the interaction types and formation habits of this cocrystal.13 The cocrystals of CL-20 and dimethylformamide
(DMF),14 nitroguanidine (NQ),15 1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitroethylene (FOX-7),16 and 4,10-dinitro-2,6,8,12-tetraoxa-4,10-diaza-tetracyclododecane
(TEX)17 were also investigated by molecular
dynamics and quantum chemistry methods, and these results illustrated
the molar ratio of cocrystals, intermolecular interactions, and sensitivities.
The above research studies are of great help to the preparation of
cocrystal explosives. Our previous works demonstrated the intermolecular
interactions between CL-20 and 3,4-dinitropyrazole (DNP) theoretically,18,19 and the results manifest that the sensitivity of the CL-20 was significantly
reduced. However, this study did not systematically reveal the influence
of the interactions between CL-20 and nitropyrazoles on their stability
and sensitivity. Nitropyrazole compounds have the potential to be
excellent coformers of CL-20 due to their good detonation properties
and low sensitivity. Their structure,20 explosive properties,21,22 and thermal decomposition23,24 have been studied through experimental and theoretical methods.
However, their effects on the sensitivity of CL-20 upon the formation
of the intermolecular interactions are not yet fully understood.

In this work, we studied the nitropyrazole/CL-20 multimolecular
complexes through a quantum chemistry treatment. Here, three kinds
of nitropyrazole molecules were designed based on the different substituent
positions and numbers in 4-nitropyrazole, which is the most stable
nitropyrazole compound with one nitro group.20 The molecular structure of 4-nitropyrazole is shown in Figure 1. The functional
groups are methyl, amino, and nitro groups, which are popular groups
in energetic materials. 4-Nitropyrazole was named N in this paper,
and the methyl, amino, and nitro derivatives were named Ax, Bx, and Cx (x = 1, 2, or 3), respectively. Core-valence bifurcation (CVB) indexes
were carried out to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions
based on the optimized geometries. Then, the influences of weak interactions
on the electronic structure and trigger bonds of CL-20 were clarified.
These results may provide a reference for designing a new insensitive
energetic cocrystal.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 MEPs of Nitropyrazoles
The MEP distribution
of nitropyrazole compounds is listed in Figures 2 and 3. All molecules
have both positive and negative MEP values at the outermost surface,
and their difference is large for N, Ax, Bx, and Cx (x = 1, 2 or
3) molecules. The maximum near the NH group is the global maximum
arising from the positively charged hydrogen, and the MEP at this
point is much larger than that of other maxima. This is because of
the presence of nitrogen, which attracted plenty of electrons from
hydrogen. The smallest MEP minimum was found at the area of the nitro
group because the oxygen in the nitro group tends to gain electrons
from nitrogen. Assuming that only electrostatic interaction exists
in the complex, the monomers are always in contact with each other
in a maximal MEP complementary manner. Therefore, the strong interaction
would formed between the atoms near the MEP extrema.

Figure 2 MEPs of CL-20, 4-nitropyrazole,
A1–A7, and B1–B3
molecules. The unit is kcal/mol. Red and blue regions represent positive
and negative MEP values, respectively. The orange and cyan spheres
represent the position of maximum and minimum points of MEP on the
surface, respectively.

Figure 3 MEPs of B4–B7 and C1–C7 molecules. The unit is kcal/mol.
Red and blue regions represent positive and negative MEP values, respectively.
The orange and cyan spheres represent the position of maximum and
minimum points of MEP on the surface, respectively.

In these monomers, the MEP maximum near the NH
group ranges from
58.97 to 75.12 kcal/mol, which is clearly higher than that of NH2 (24.95–47.55 kcal/mol), CH (18.12–47.95 kcal/mol),
and CH3 groups (11.93–30.68 kcal/mol). When these
molecules come in contact with CL-20, the interaction between the
NO2 of CL-20 and NH of pyrazoles is larger than the others.
The MEP minimum near the exposed N on the pyrazole ring is from −28.65
to −13.58 kcal/mol, which is larger than that of the nitro
group. Therefore, the CH group of CL-20 would preferentially interact
with the NO2 rather than with the N on the pyrazole ring.

Figures 2 and 3 also show the extreme value distribution for each
molecule. For Ax molecules, the MEP minimum shows
a decreasing trend as the position and number of methyl groups change.
The introduction of electron-donating groups affects the electron
density of the molecule and thus manifests itself in the extreme value
distribution of the electrostatic potential on the surface of the
molecule. A similar rule can be found in Bx molecules.
However, for the Cx molecules, the MEPs are opposite
the first two types of molecules. As the number of nitro groups increases,
the minimum decreases. The nitro group is the only electron-withdrawing
group in these complexes, and its introduction allows a part of the
electrons to be shared among the electron-withdrawing groups in the
molecule, thereby reducing the difference between the electrostatic
potentials near the nitro groups. In Figure 3, the difference is small between the MEP
extremes near the nitro groups in the Cx molecules.
The variation of the maximum value of the electrostatic potential
is not as obvious as that of the minimum value. In general, however,
the maximum value of a molecule with an NH group is always higher
than that of other molecules.

As shown in Figures 2 and 3, in most cases,
the total positive
surface area of the molecular surface is greater than the total area
of the negative electrostatic potential. The total positive surface
area of the surface of each type of molecule exhibits a similar pattern:
the number of substituents increases, and the total area of positive
values increases. In C6 molecules, the substituents in this molecule
are all electron-withdrawing groups, hence the main positive MEP distributed
in both sides of the pyrazole ring.

2.2 Geometries
and Weak Interactions
At first, we assembled and optimized
the initial multimolecular complexes
of CL-20 and nitropyrazoles using the GFN2-xTB program25 where CL-20 is completely surrounded by nitropyrazole
molecules. Then, the molecules that have less influence on CL-20 are
removed one by one until each nitropyrazole molecule is essential.
The ORCA program is used for structural optimization and frequency
calculation of the final multimolecular complexes. The criterion for
judging whether the nitropyrazole is indispensable is that each nitropyrazole
molecule interacts with CL-20, and as much as possible, the nitropyrazole
molecule encapsulates the CL-20 molecule.

The optimized complex
structures are listed in Figure S1 of the
Supporting Information. The hydrogen bonds (HBs) were counted and
are listed in Table S1 of the Supporting
Information. As shown in Table S1, a great
number of HBs are present in each complex, including C–H···O,
N–H···O, and C–H···N.
The strength of the H-bonds formed between the NH and NO2 is higher than that between the CH3 and NO2. For example, in N/CL-20, the length of the H101···O17
bond is 2.208 Å, which is shorter than that of the others (ranged
from 2.432–2.989 Å). The shortest bond length for C–H···O
is 2.166 Å in A5/CL-20 and for N–H···O
is 1.923 Å in C3/CL-20. The number of HBs in Ax/CL-20 and Bx/CL-20 is more than that in Cx/CL-20. The substituent in Cx is the NO2; meanwhile, the nitro group in the CL-20 is exposed outside.
Therefore, compared with Ax/CL-20 and Bx/CL-20, the number of HBs in Cx/CL-20 is reduced,
and O···O interactions increased inevitably.

The proportions of various intermolecular interactions in the multimolecular
complexes were carried out to study the diversity of the interactions.
In Figure 4, the proportion
of the O···H HB is quite larger than the other interactions,
especially in Ax/CL-20 and Bx/CL-20
complexes. The N···H HB also could be found in some
complexes, and it accounts for a small proportion. However, in Cx/CL-20 multimolecular complexes, this action does not exist
except in C2/CL-20. On the contrary, O···O interaction
is more popular in these multimolecular complexes, owing to the more
likely appearance of a nitro group in the Cx molecule.
Beyond the above interactions, O···C, O···N,
and N···N are also present in these multimolecular
complexes.

Figure 4 Proportions of various intermolecular interactions in the multimolecular
complexes.

According to the above analysis,
many types of intermolecular interactions
exist in these complexes; however, the HB is the strongest and most
attractive. Therefore, the core-valence bifurcation (CVB) index was
used to study the strength of HBs, and then the nature of interactions
in complexes was investigated through energy decomposition. The CVB
index, first proposed by Fuster in 2000,44 was mainly used to distinguish the strength of HBs. This index was
defined based on the electron localization function (ELF): CVB index
= ELF(C-V) – ELF(DH-A) where ELF(C-V) corresponds to the ELF
bifurcation value between the ELF core domain and valence domain,
while the ELF(DH-A) stands for the ELF value at the bifurcation point
between V(D,H) and V(A). The CVB index is positive for weak HBs, and
this index is negative for strong HBs. Usually, the CVB index of strong
HBs is negative; the CVB index of medium-strength HBs is around 0;
the CVB index of weak HBs is generally positive.26,27,44 The CVB indexes of HBs in these complexes
are listed in Table S1 of the Supporting
Information. As shown in Table S1, all
CVBs are positive and larger than 0.01175, which is the value of the
N113-H120···O36 bond in B4/CL-20. Therefore, weak HBs
were formed in these multimolecular complexes. The nitro group is
one of the most common explosophores (functional group that makes
a compound explosive) used globally. However, it is not a superior
HB acceptor. Therefore, the strength of the HB formed among energetic
molecules is generally weaker than that of drug molecules or biomolecules.

In order to figure out the nature of weak interactions in the multimolecular
complexes, the energy decomposition analysis (EDA) was calculated
based on the classical molecular force field (FF). The General AMBER
Force Field (GAFF) and charges from electrostatic potentials using
a grid-based method (CHELPG) are used to conduct the EDA–FF
analysis. The major ingredients of weak interactions are electrostatic
interaction and van der Waals (vdW) interaction, and the latter can
be divided into repulsive interaction and attractive dispersion interaction.
The EDA–FF results are shown in Figure 5, and the detailed energies are shown in Table S2 of the Supporting Information. As seen
from the bar chart, the attractive dispersion interactions dominate
in whole interactions, and the electrostatic interactions are much
lower in value than the dispersion interactions because of the contacts
among O, N, and C atoms. Due to the presence of multiple nitro groups
in the molecule, the electrostatic interactions in Cx/CL-20 complexes are weaker, and the dispersion interactions are
larger than those of the other two.

Figure 5 Interaction energy decomposition of nitropyrazole/CL-20
multimolecular
complexes. The black line represents the total energy Eint.* obtained from the EDA–FF analysis. The red line represents
the interaction energy (Eint.) calculated at the
M06-2X-D3/def2-TZVP level.

For the line chart in Figure 5, although there are some differences between the corresponding
values, the trends of the two curves are almost the same. Generally,
the greater the interaction energy, the better the stability. Therefore,
the stability of Cx/CL-20 tends to be weak because
the interaction energy (Eint.) becomes small. The Eint. of Bx/CL-20 is higher than that of
the other two kinds of complexes. This may be because the substituent
on the nitropyrazole molecule in the complex is the amino group, which
is an effective HB electron-donating group capable of forming a stronger
HB.

As analyzed above, the proportion of electrostatic interaction
increased in those complexes. Compared with N/CL-20, the dispersion
interaction is an important component of the intermolecular weak interaction.
The indispensable role of dispersion in energetic complexes and crystals
should be emphasized in future studies.

2.3 Sensitivity
The nitro charge was
used to study the sensitivity of these complexes. Many studies have
shown that the more negative is the nitro charge of an explosive molecule,
the lower is the impact sensitivity.28−30 The Mulliken charge
was used to evaluate the nitro group charges. The radar charts of
the nitro group charges in complexes and the CL-20 monomer are shown
in Figure 6, and the
detailed data is shown in Table S3 of the
Supporting Information. In Figure 5, the charges of most of the nitro groups are lower
than −0.08893 e or more negative, indicating that the sensitivity
of these complexes is significantly improved relative to the CL-20
molecule. In the CL-20 monomer, the charges of N31O33O34 and N32O35O36
groups are larger than those of the others; therefore, these two groups
make CL-20 sensitive. The charges of all nitro groups in CL-20 increase
after interacting with nitropyrazole molecules. Not only in the complexes
but also in the CL-20 monomer, the charge on N31O33O34 and N32O35O36
groups is relatively positive. In contrast, the charges of the specific
nitro group tend to become more positive than those of the CL-20 monomer,
such as the N32O35O36 group in A6/CL-20 and the N31O33O34 group in
B1/CL-20. The nitro group charge of the N32O35O36 group is the most
positive among these groups, so the impact sensitivity of complexes
is most affected by this group.

Figure 6 Nitro group charges of CL-20 in nitropyrazole/CL-20
multimolecular
complexes. The units are e. The black dotted line represents the contour
of −0.08893 e, which is the charge of the most negative nitro
group in the CL-20 monomer.

Additionally, we analyzed the bond length and the bond dissociation
energy (BDE) of the N–N bonds in CL-20 in order to study the
bond strength of potential trigger bonds. The bond length and BDE
are shown in Figures 7 and 8; the detailed data are listed in Table S4 of the Supporting Information. The longer
the trigger bond length is, the easier it is to break the bond, so
the molecule may be more sensitive. In Figure 7, most N–N bond lengths are shorter
than 1.442 Å, indicating the stronger bond strength upon the
formation of intermolecular weak interactions. However, the lengths
of N17–N20 in B3/CL-20 and N3–N7 in B7/CL-20 have increased
to some extent. N3–N7 and N4–N8 are the longest bonds
in the CL-20 monomer, and those in complexes tend to be shorter, suggesting
the strengthening of the bond. Therefore, the most easily broken N–N
bonds in the complex are different from those in the CL-20 monomer;
in other words, the CL-20 trigger bond shifts to other N–N
bonds because of the interactions with nitropyrazole molecules. Besides,
the N30–N32 bond is not the longest bond in all complexes.
From the above analysis, the N–N bond strength in complexes
may be stronger than that in the CL-20 monomer. Following this, we
calculated the bond dissociation energy (BDE) to discuss the strength
of N–N bonds, as shown in Figure 8.

Figure 7 N–N bond length of CL-20 in nitropyrazole/CL-20
multimolecular
complexes. The unit is Å. The black dotted line represents the
isoline with a bond length of 1.442 Å, which is the longest N–N
bond in the CL-20 monomer.

Figure 8 N–N bond BDE of CL-20 in pyrazole/CL-20 multimolecular complexes.
The unit is kcal/mol. The black dotted line represents the isoline
with a BDE of 50.63 kcal/mol, which is the lowest BDE in the CL-20
monomer.

The larger is the BDE, the more
stable is the bond. In Figure 8, the BDE of N–N
bonds in CL-20 tends to be larger after the formation of intermolecular
interactions, except for N4–N8 (50.09 kcal/mol) in the C4/CL-20
complex. According to the results of BDE calculations, the strength
of N–N bonds increased due to the weak interactions with nitropyrazoles.
The smallest BDE in the CL-20 monomer comes from N3–N7 and
N4–N8 bonds. The strength of these two bonds increased in multimolecular
complexes; therefore, the trigger bond of CL-20 may shift to other
N–N bonds, as it is in the result of bond length analysis.
Similarly, the lowest BDE in N–N mainly was found in N3–N7,
N4–N8, N17–N21, and N18–N22 bonds, only N30–N32
in A1/CL-20, and N29–N31in A4/CL-20. To sum up, the strength
of N–N bonds in the CL-20 monomer increased, and the trigger
bond may shift compared with that in original CL-20.

In brief,
the above analysis showed that most nitro charges of
CL-20 in complexes are more negative than those in the CL-20 monomer,
and most N–N bond lengths and BDE of CL-20 in complexes are
shorter and larger than those in the CL-20 monomer, respectively.
Namely, CL-20 tends to be low in sensitivity after the formation of
weak interactions with nitropyrazole compounds.

2.4 Electron Density Difference Analysis
The electron density
difference (EDD) is the difference in electron
density between the systems in their respective states. The EDD was
used to analyze the change in electron density between CL-20 and nitropyrazole
molecules upon the formation of intermolecular interactions, as shown
in Figure 9. The electron
density of CL-20 may be closely related to its sensitivity, and is
affected by many factors, such as weak interactions and solvent. Therefore,
it is important to study the EDD of CL-20 before and after the formation
of the complex.

Figure 9 Electron density difference (EDD) in nitropyrazole/CL-20
multimolecular
complexes. The lime and tan isosurfaces (+0.0012 and −0.0012
a.u., respectively) represent the region in which electron density
is increased and decreased after CL-20 coordinated to nitropyrzoles,
respectively.

The molecular conformer
of CL-20 has changed greatly relative to
the initial structure, which is caused by the contact with surrounding
nitropyrazoles. Such a phenomenon is popular in cocrystal systems,
for example, CL-20 in the CL-20/TNT cocrystal transforms from its
ε-form to β-form. It is obvious that electron density
is shifted from nitropyrzoles toward nitrogen and oxygen atoms of
nitro groups in CL-20 to strengthen the trigger bond. Besides, it
can be seen that the appearance of nitropyrazoles does not increase
the electron density of cage in CL-20 remarkably, and only electron
loss mainly occurred on the cage structure in CL-20. The area of electron
density that increased is significantly larger and occurs mainly near
the nitro group of CL-20. These changes in electron density are likely
to cause the nitro charge to become negative and cause the bond strength
to become stronger.

3 Conclusions
Quantum
chemical methods were used to determine the geometric and
electronic structures and trigger bond strengths for the CL-20 monomer
and the multimolecular complexes formed with nitropyrazole derivatives.
Nitropyrazoles exhibit a significant difference in electrostatic potential
and therefore cause a difference in the interaction site. The dominance
of the dispersion interaction is very common in nitropyrazole/CL-20
multimolecular complexes. In the complex, the N–N bond strength
of CL-20 becomes stronger due to the shorter bond length and larger
BDE. Moreover, the sum of nitro negative charges in complexes is higher
than that in the CL-20 monomer, suggesting a lower sensitivity for
CL-20 in multimolecular complexes. The electron density difference
analysis showed that the electron densities of N–NO2 in CL-20 are influenced by the intermolecular interactions. Those
effects make the CL-20 less sensitive and more stable.

4 Computational Methods
All nitropyrazole monomers were fully
optimized at the B3LYP31,32/6-311g(d,p)33 level. All corresponding
complexes with CL-20 were optimized through the B97-3c method34 with def2/J35 auxiliary
basis. B97-3c,34 first proposed by Grimme
in 2018, is a low-cost electronic structure method that ideally combines
the semilocal B97 density functional in a medium-sized basis set expansion
of triple-ζ quality with classical correction potentials.36,37 Frequency calculations were executed at the same levels to confirm
that all structures meet the ground-state minimum. The trigger bond
dissociation energies ((BDE = E(R·) + E(·NO2)
– E(R-NO2)) were obtained at the M06-2X38/def2-TZVP39 level
with DFT-D3 dispersion correction.36,37 The interaction
energy (Eint. = E(AB) – E(A) – E(B))
was calculated at the M06-2X-D3/def2-TZVP level with the counterpoise
(CP) correction. The molecular electrostatic potentials (MEPs)40,41 on the electron density isosurface and the electron density difference
(EDD) plots were displayed by the VMD 1.9.3 program42 through the outputs of Multiwfn 3.6 software.43 The atomic charges and core-valence bifurcation
(CVB) indexes44 were calculated by Multiwfn.
The electronic structures of nitropyrazole compounds were carried
out with the Gaussian 09 program package.45 The electronic structures of complexes were calculated by ORCA 4.1.0.46,47
