An electrochemical
immunosensor for Vibrio cholerae toxin
(VCT) has been developed using electrospun carbon nanofibers
(CNFs) as the electrode platform. To fabricate the immunosensor, the
anti-cholera toxin antibody (Ab) was covalently immobilized on the
electrode platforms using the carbodiimide chemistry for the amide
bond formation. Every step of the formation of the immunosensor and
the subsequent binding of the VCT subunit antigen (Ag) was electrochemically
interrogated. The immunosensor gave excellent reproducibility and
sensitivities: limits of detection (ca. 1.2 × 10–13 g mL–1), limits of quantification (ca. 1.3 ×
10–13 g mL–1), and a wide linear
range for the anti-cholera detection of 8 orders of magnitude (10–13 to 10–5 g mL–1). One of the key findings was the enhanced sensitivity of the VCT
detection using aged rather than the freshly prepared redox probe,
described here as Redox Probe Aging-Induced Sensitivity Enhancement
(“Redox-PrAISE”). The Redox-PrAISE was found more useful
in the real application of these immunosensors, showing comparable
or even better sensitivity for eight real cholera-infested water samples
than the conventional clinical culture method. This immunosensor shows
promise for the potential development of point-of-care diagnosis of
VCT. Importantly, this study highlights the importance of considering
the nature of the redox probe on the electrochemical sensing conditions
when designing impedimetric immunosensors.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Cholera
is a major public health problem. It is caused by a bacterium
called Vibrio cholerae, a gram-negative,
facultative anaerobe. It is associated with several clinical symptoms,
including diarrhea, vomiting, discomfort, cramping, sunken eyes, dry
mouth, cold clammy skin, decreased skin turgor, and wrinkled hands
and feet.1−5 Cholera is known as a highly contagious disease capable of killing
within hours if not identified and treated as the mortality rate can
be more than 50% of the reported cases.1 The most common transmission path is from person to person and from
water sources or food to person due to poor sanitation and/or lack
of access to clean water. It has been estimated by the World Health
Organization (WHO) that there are more than 3–5 million cholera
cases per year worldwide.6 The disease
affects mostly the resource-limited developing countries6,7 and especially countries that frequently experience natural disasters,
such as flooding, that lead to poor sanitation and/or lack of access
to clean water. The incubation period of V. cholerae prior to the manifestation of symptoms may range from less than
a day to five days.2,3

Considering the above-stated
cholera-related health problems, there
has always been an urgent need for the rapid diagnosis of cholera
in order to expedite the treatment of affected individuals. The proper
management of cholera outbreak requires affordable, accurate, reproducible,
reliable, and rapid detection methods. It is well known that the early
detection of cholera outbreak still remains a challenge.8 There are several methods reported in the literature
for the detection of cholera, as elegantly shown in a recent review.9 The current methods as seen in the literature
include the gold standard culture method,10 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay,11 radioimmunoassay,12 latex agglutination assays,13 polymerase chain reaction (PCR),5,14 and
electrochemical techniques.15−20 Generally, non-electrochemical methods take hours and days to diagnose
cholera and require specialist skills to execute and thus are incompatible
for fast diagnosis and field screening. For example, the culture method,
which is the gold standard for the detection of cholera, involves
the isolation of the bacteria from stool samples on selective media
followed by biochemical identification and serotyping with monoclonal
antibodies.10 The culture method is disadvantageous
as it is time consuming and requires several media/reagents as well
as specialist skills to perform. It is a multistep technique, requiring
such steps as enrichment with media and incubation at 35–37
°C for 18–24 h. The delay in detecting the infection allows
cholera to kill very fast, with death occurring in 12–24 h
if untreated.4 It takes approximately 8
days to confirm the cholera case.21 PCR
combined with culture method results gives enhanced specificity,22 but it is very costly and time consuming. Most
researchers use expensive and/or difficult-to-prepare materials for
developing immunosensors.9−14,17,20−22 In electrochemistry, for example, Palomara et al.20 used copper(II) complex functionalized via electrocoating
of polypyrrole-nitrilotriacetic acid [poly(pyrrole-NTA)] on multi-walled
carbon nanotubes (Cu2+/pp-NTA/MWCNTs). Tshikalaha and Arotiba17 employed the generation-2 poly(propylene imine)
(PPI) dendrimer and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) electro-co-deposited
on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) for the detection of cholera toxin.
With the exception of Gupta et al.,18,19 who reported
that the current response increases with the increasing concentration
of the cholera toxin, every other report to date on the electrochemical
detection of cholera toxin involved the suppression of the current
response upon increasing the concentration of the cholera toxin. In
all cases, there is a need to develop electrochemical immunosensors
that use low-cost carbon materials that are easy to prepare and deploy
as an electrode platform that allows for fast, sensitive, and reliable
detection of V. cholerae toxin (VCT).

Electrochemical techniques offer most advantages for the detection
of cholera because they are simple to operate, very sensitive, specific,
rapid, and low cost and can be miniaturized for portability and point-of-care
diagnosis. In this work, we interrogated the possibility of developing
highly sensitive and selective electrochemical immunosensors for V. cholerae in water samples using carbon nanofibers
(CNFs). This is the first time that CNF has been reported for application
as a viable electrode platform for the detection of V. cholerae. The choice for CNF is motivated by several
reasons. Most importantly, serendipitously, we made a new finding
on the use of the “aged” redox probe to improve the
sensitivity of detection of V. cholerae in real cholera-infested water samples. We believe that this unique
observation strongly highlights the importance of considering the
nature of the redox probe on the electrochemical sensing conditions,
especially when designing impedimetric immunosensors.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Electron-Transfer Dynamics
of the Electrodes
Electrospun CNFs used as the platform for
the electrochemical immunosensors
for cholera toxin in this work were obtained using the conventional
electrospinning technique.23,24 The fabrication of
the electrochemical immunosensor [i.e., GCE modified with CNF, antibody
(Ab), and bovin serum albumin (BSA)] adopted the conventional method
of covalently linking the antibody onto the electrode platform.25,26 The immunosensor (GCE–CNF–Ab–BSA) is ready
to be used for the sensing of the antigen (Ag), also described as
VCT. The various steps involved have been schematically represented
in Figure 1 (described
in detail in the Experimental Section). To
understand the extent to which the immunosensor permits the redox
probe to transport the electron, the bare GCE and its modified surfaces
(GCE–CNF to GCE–CNF–Ab–BSA) were subjected
to cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) experiments in a 0.14 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)/AE (pH
7.4) containing a redox probe, 0.1 M [Fe(CN)6]3–/[Fe(CN)6]4– solution (see the Supporting Information, Figure S2). The choice
of a high concentration of the redox probe has been informed mainly
by the need to eliminate the diffuse layer effect (Frumkin effect),
as clearly articulated in the literature27−30 (also see the explanation for
Figure S2 in the Supporting Information).

Figure 1 Experimental protocol (and time needed) for the fabrication and
sensing mechanism of an electrochemical immunosensor for VCT. The
fabrication process takes approximately 12 h. Abbreviations: EDC =
1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydroxide; sulfo-NHS
= N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide. Inset (A) shows typical
scanning electron micrograph (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX)
of bare GCE, confirming mostly the C content, while (B) shows the
SEM and EDX of V. cholerae antibody-modified
GCE, showing the presence of C, O, S, F, Na, and Cl, which may be
related to the cholera antibody, linking agents, and saline solutions
from which the immunosensor was prepared. While the bare GCE is smooth
(homogeneous), the modified GCE surface exhibited a highly heterogeneous
surface with a dendrite- or lichen-like morphology.

From the CV profiles, the electron-transfer properties could
be
established from the following parameters (summarized in the Supporting Information, Table S1): (i) the ratio
of the anodic-to-cathodic peak current heights (Ipa/Ipc), which should be unity
for an ideal reversible process; (ii) the voltammetric current response,
which defines the mass transport; and (iii) the peak-to-peak separation
potential (ΔEp), which defines the
rate of electron transfer, which is 0.059 V/n for a one-electron reversible
reaction (the smaller it is, the faster is the electron transfer,
and vice versa). The ΔEp decreases
as follows: GCE (0.230 V) < GCE–CNF (0.256 V) < GCE–CNF–Ab
(0.322 V) < GCE–CNF–Ab–BSA (0.620 V), indicating
that the GCE–CNF–Ab–BSA gives the strongest resistance
to electron transport. The Ipa/Ipc follows a similar trend, meaning that GCE–CNF–Ab–BSA
is the least reversible, while GCE and GCE–CNF are the most
reversible. The results indicate that the ET processes between the
redox probe and the underlying GCE surface become difficult as the
modifying redox-inactive layers are increased. On the other hand,
the voltammetric current response decreases as follows (using the
anodic peak current, Ipa, as example):
GCE (1.55 mA) > GCE–CNF (0.95 mA) > GCE–CNF–Ab
(0.89 mA) > GCE–CNF–Ab–BSA (∼0.3 mA),
which defines the level of mass transport (i.e., the rate at which
the redox probe solution moves from the bulk electrolyte solution
to the electrode surface). The current generated at the surface of
the porous electrode is due to two diffusion processes: (i) semi-infinite planar diffusion (in this case, the redox
probe solution toward the macro-electrode surface) and (ii) thin-layer diffusion (i.e., a small volume of the redox
probe solution trapped in pockets within the porous structure).31 Thin-layer diffusion, combined with the semi-infinite
diffusion, enhances the overall current response of the electrode.
However, if the electrolyte in the pores of the porous electrode film
is significantly depleted of the electroactive species on the experiment
timescale, then the overall current response will be diminished. Thus,
the high current response of the GCE is related to its nonporous surface
that encourages semi-infinite diffusion but discourages the trapping
of the electrolyte. On the other hand, the porous nature of the other
electrodes (CNF, CNF–Ab, and CNF–Ab–BSA) allows
for the trapping of the redox probe species longer than the experimental
timescale, hence the reduced current response. The slightly higher
current response of the CNF–Ab over the CNF is interpreted
in terms of the Ab permitting the thin layer diffusion compared to
the CNF.

In addition, the surface coverage of the antibody was
estimated
from the CV evolution of the redox probe (see the Supporting Information). The values of the surface coverage
were approximately 2.68 × 10–7 and 2.86 ×
10–7 mol cm–2 for the GCE–CNF
and GCE–CNF–Ab, respectively. These results demonstrate
that the amount of the antibody on the CNF is extremely small, ca.
1.8 × 10–8 mol cm–2.

2.2 Electrochemical Detection of Cholera Toxins:
Calibration Curve
The electrochemical detection of VCT at
the GCE–CNF–Ab–BSA immunoelectrode was carried
out at different concentrations of VCT (45.5 μg/mL to 0.13 pg/mL,
obtained via serial dilutions) with square wave voltammetry (SWV)
(Figure 2A,B) and EIS
(Figure 2C,D) in 0.1
M [Fe(CN)6]3–/[Fe(CN)6]4–/0.14 M PBS/AE solution (pH 7.4) at its equilibrium
potential (E1/2 = 0.26 V vs Ag/AgCl, 3
M KCl). Prior to electrochemical testing, 10 μL of VCT was drop-cast
onto the surface of the immunoelectrode and incubated for 20 min at
25 °C. In contrast to the literature,18,19 we observed that the SWV current response decreased with the increasing
VCT concentration (Figure 2A,B). This decrease in the current response is indicative
of the formation of the antibody–antigen complex of the V. cholerae toxin on the immunoelectrode surface,
which is non-conducting (i.e., insulating or redox inactive). Moreover,
the resolution of the SWV is so poor that it shows weak double peaks
for each of the samples; the reason for this behavior is unknown at
this moment but may be related to possible disruption/re-arrangement
of the “lock-and-key” bond of the antibody–antigen
complex during the voltammetric process. Efforts to extend the potential
window from −0.2 to 1.4 V (vs Ag|AgCl, 3 M KCl) did not yield
any positive result.

Figure 2 (A) SWV responses of the GCE-modified immunosensor (GCE–CNF–Ab–BSA)

Nyquist plots (Zim vs Zre) for the EIS measurements at different VCT concentrations
as in (A); (D) EIS-measurement calibration curve for the detection

(pH 7.4) containing 0.1 M [Fe(CN)6]3–/[Fe(CN)6]4–; and (E) the mechanism
of interaction between the VCT antibody–antigen that leads
to the suppression of the electron transport; thus, the increase in
impedance as the concentration of the VCT antigen is increased. The
broken arrows simply depict poor electron transport.

The corresponding behavior was observed with the EIS (Figure 2C,D), where the combined
resistances in series (i.e., Rts = Rct1 + Rct2) increased
with increasing VCT concentrations. Figure 2E is a schematic representation of the “lock-and-key”
antibody–antigen interaction mechanism. Each point on the SWV-
and EIS-based calibration graphs represents the average value obtained
from replicate measurements (n = 6). The limit of
detection (LoD) is defined as the lowest concentration of VCT that
produces a reading of 3s (where s is the standard deviation of the blank signal) above the blank signal,
under the same experimental conditions. The limit of quantification/determination
(LoQ = 10s) is defined as the concentration of the VCT sample that
produces a signal that cannot be confused with that of the blank solution
and that could be quantified.32,33 Both SWV and EIS techniques
gave a good linear concentration range (LCR) for VCT (1.3 × 10–13 to 4.56 × 10–5 g mL–1, R2 > 0.99). At higher VCT concentrations
(>46 × 10–6 g mL–1), the
current or charge transfer resistance measured by the immunosensor
reached saturation, accompanied by poor performance of the sensor
due to overload of the biomaterials on the surface. Both SWV and EIS
techniques gave high sensitivity toward VCT detection: −8.813
μA/log[VCT] (g mL–1) for SWV and 9.775 Ω/log[VCT
(g mL–1)] for EIS. The LoD and LoQ were estimated
as 1.25 × 10–13 and 1.31 × 10–13 g mL–1, respectively. Repeat concentration studies
were conducted using same samples prepared for Figure 2 after about 2 months (see the Supporting Information, Figure S3). Interestingly,
albeit there was a slight change in the shape of the response curves
(especially the EIS) compared to the fresh sample analysis (Figure 2), there was no significant
change in the concentration curve graphs. Table 1 compares the electrochemical detection parameters
using different platforms for cholera immunosensors with some recent
literature. Clearly, our platform (CNF) not only is simple to fabricate,
but also proves to be efficient for enhanced electrochemical detection
compared to the literature (in terms of wider LCR and low LoD and
LoQ).

2.3 Aging
Effect of the Redox Probe on the Capacitive
Detection Protocols
Redox probe (notably [Fe(CN)6]3–/[Fe(CN)6]4–) commonly
serves as the critical element of the EIS-based immunosensing.34−39 In other words, the stability or chemistry of the redox probe has
a direct relationship to the sensitivity of the immunosensor. Out
of curiosity, we decided to test the immunosensor in freshly prepared
(used within 24 h after preparation) and aged solution (after 30 days
of preparation, stored at room temperature) of [Fe(CN)6]3–/[Fe(CN)6]4–, and
to our surprise, we observed different EIS and SWV data for blank
and VCT analytes (Figure 3). There are some important findings here, especially for
EIS: first, unlike the fresh solution of the redox probe (Figure 3A) that was fitted
with a simple Randles circuit (∼Rs(Cdl[RctZw])∼), the aged redox probe (Figure 3B) solution was fitted
with the Randles–Voigt circuit with one RC element (∼Rs(Cdl[RctZw])(Rct1Cdl1)∼). Second, from the fitted parameters (Table 1), there is a slight
increase in the electrolyte resistance (Rs) value from ∼66 Ω (for the fresh) to ∼82 Ω
(for the aged), indicative of some changes in the chemistry of the
original solution. Third, there is an increased sensitivity of VCT
detection (i.e., high value of the total charge resistance) upon aging
of the redox probe. Fourth, and most importantly, the last semicircle
(Rct1) is more pronounced for the VCT
analyte and can possibly serve as a unique signature polarization
resistance (hereinafter abbreviated as Rspr) for the interaction of VCT with the immunosensor.
This was tested and found to be true (see the next section on a real
water sample analysis). The enhanced sensitivity of the VCT detection
arising from the aging of the redox probe may be described as Redox
Probe Ageing-Induced Sensitivity Enhancement (abbreviated herein as
“Redox-PrAISE”). Similar experiments were carried out
for SWV (Figure 3C,D),
with the aged solution showing broader and lower peak current responses
at a higher potential (∼0.5 V vs Ag/AgCl, 3 M KCl) compared
to the fresh redox solution (∼0.3 V vs Ag/AgCl, 3 M KCl), confirming
increased electrolyte resistivity and poorer charge transport properties
(excellently corroborating the EIS data of Figure 3A,B, as also shown in Table 2). Thus, subsequent measurements were focused
on the more sensitive EIS-based Redox-PrAISE for VCT detection.

immunosensor (GCE–CNF–Ab–BSA) for the detection

The reason for the aging of the [Fe(CN)6]3–/[Fe(CN)6]4– solution and its implications
on the sensitivity of the immunosensor is not fully understood at
the moment and requires a detailed future investigation. However,
from a body of literature, it has been known that ferricyanide/ferrocyanide
can decompose due to the cleavage of CN under UV irradiation40 and electron irradiation41−43 and, recently,
by intense synchrotron radiation via in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy,44 which led to the precipitation of the passivating
ferric (hydr)oxide species that inhibited the redox process of the
ferri-/ferrocyanide. Thus, it is highly possible that our finding
in this work is due to the decomposition of the [Fe(CN)6]3–/[Fe(CN)6]4– solution
occurring at a slower rate at normal room temperature. This is an
important preliminary observation for the redox probe-based electrochemical
detection. Since this has never been reported in the literature, there
is a need for further interrogation in the future.

2.4 Regeneration of the Immunosensor Surface
The regeneration
study of the immunoelectrode surface was carried
out in three steps: First, the immunosensor was immersed in PBS/AE
containing antigen (VCT) for 20 min. Second, it was washed in a PBS/AE
buffer solution and distilled de-ionized water and dried in nitrogen
gas. Third, it was used for the detection of VCT (8.90 × 10–7 g mL–1). Finally, the immunosensor
was dipped into a glycine HCl buffer (pH 2.8) for 5 min (to remove
the bound antigen cells). These steps were repeated 4–5 times
to determine the percentage changes in the signal (if any). A typical
SWV regeneration study is exemplified in Figure S4. SWV and the bar chart of the current response versus VCT
concentration after different regeneration (Supporting Information, Figure S4) clearly show, within limits of errors,
no significant change in current response. The result shows that the
immunosensor surface can be regenerated and reused a few times for
the detection of VCT. The chemistry behind the regeneration with glycine
is known.45 Glycine is an amino acid that
is zwitterionic. It is able to bind to the surface of the bioreceptor
(immunosensor) as well as the bioanalyte due to the thermodynamic
feasibility of such a binding process. Thus, when the bioreceptor
is exposed to the regeneration buffer containing glycine, it is partially
protected from the damage arising from the change in the pH environment.

2.5 Selectivity/Interference Studies
Selectivity/interference
studies were carried out in the presence
of the interferents in physiological fluids or environment, with 0.5
mM stock solutions of ascorbic acid (AA), citric acid (CA), and uric
acid (UA), respectively. During the measurements, the same concentration
(0.5 mM) of each of the interferents (AA, CA, and UA) was mixed with
a fixed VCT concentration (8.90 × 10–7 g mL–1), and the electrochemical response after 20 min incubation
time was observed and recorded. Typical SWV measurements (Supporting Information, Figure S5) showed no
detectable difference in the current responses of the VCT sample in
the absence and presence of the physiological interfering molecules.
This is not totally surprising considering that antibody–antigen
interactions are known for their unique specificity/selectivity.

2.6 Determination of VCT in Water Samples
Considering
the higher sensitivity of the proposed EIS-based Redox-PrAISE
method over the SWV counterpart, it was used for the analysis of different
water samples obtained from local water bodies that were suspected
to be cholera infested. However, prior to the Redox-PrAISE experiment,
the water samples were tested for being contaminated with V. cholerae by using the culture method.46 The suspected water was collected (Figure 4A), 2 mL of the water
sample was inoculated in alkaline peptone water (APW) and incubated/cultured
for 12 h at 37 °C in ambient air (Figure 4B), and then, it was sub-cultured in thiosulfate
citrate bile salt sucrose (TCBS agar) as the selective medium for
24 h at 37 °C in ambient air (Figure 4C). Note that APW is the preferred enrichment
broth for the isolation of V. cholera present in any sample (be it clinical, food, or water). APW is characterized
by its light-yellow-colored clear solution appearance. The presence
of V. cholerae growing on TCBS agar
plates is indicated by a yellow coloration. In this work, the suspected
cholera-infested water samples are labeled S1–S7, S8 (tap water),
S9 (bottled water), and S10 (alcohol–water mixture: 70% alcohol,
30% tap water). The contamination of samples with V.
cholera is easily established by a turbid or cloudy
growth with APW. As clearly evident in Figure 4B, the turbidity level decreases as S1 >
S2 > S3 > S4 > S5 > S6 > S7 ≫ S8 ≈ S9
≈ S10.
The trend is essentially the same for the TCBS agar plates (Figure 4C), suggesting that
samples S8–S10 showed no detectable presence of V. cholera.

Figure 4 Steps for the culture method of detecting V. cholera: suspected water was collected (A), 2
mL of the water sample was
inoculated in APW and incubated/cultured for 12 h at 37 °C in
ambient air (B); then, it was sub-cultured in TCBS agar as the selective
medium for 24 h at 37 °C in ambient air (C). The suspected cholera-infected
samples are labeled S1–S8, while sample S9 (bottled water)
and S10 (alcohol–water mixture: 70% alcohol, 30% tap water)
serve as controls. All the photos were taken during the course of
this study by Ozoemena.

Next, the Redox-PrAISE
experiment was conducted as described before,
focusing on the signature polarization resistance (Rspr), as depicted in Figure 5A,B. It is interesting to observe that the
VCT concentrations in the samples are more clearly defined in the RC elements of the low-frequency region (shown as oval,
i.e., Rspr) than in the high-frequency
region, confirming the choice for the application of Rspr as the signature charge-transfer resistance for cholera
toxin infection in water samples in this work.

analysis in Figure 4 are used here: suspected cholera-infected samples are labeled S1–S8,
while sample S9 (bottled water) and S10 (alcohol–water mixture:
70% alcohol, 30% tap water) serve as controls. Note that (A,B) are
separated for clarity. (C) Represents the bar chart of the ΔRct/Ω vs water samples.

The change in the total charge-transfer resistance (ΔRct/Ω) for each water sample, control,
or standard solution was calculated in accordance with the literature34,35 1  where RAg is the
immunosensor resistance of the blank solution, while RAg-VCT is the value of the immunosensor resistance
after incubation with the water samples and control solutions. Figure 5C represents the
bar chart of ΔRct against the various
water samples (S1–S10, including the standard VCT sample (8.90
× 10–7 g mL–1) and blank
PBS/AE solution) using the full polarization resistance and the signature
resistance (Rspr) alone. Samples S9 and
S10 showed no presence of cholera in excellent agreement with the
culture method. However, note that EIS showed some presence of cholera
infection in S8, seemingly lower than the detection limit of the culture
method, which may explain the high sensitivity of the EIS method.
In fact, high sensitivity is a key signature of the EIS method, and
this is well reported in the literature that even the smallest amounts
of analytes, such as antibodies or antibody-related substances,36,37 can provoke measurable changes with EIS, allowing high sensitivities38 even to the femtomolar levels.39

3 Conclusions
The
application of electrospun CNFs as viable electrode platforms
for the development of simple and highly sensitive immunosensors for
VCT has been described. The immunosensor was easily fabricated by
adopting the carbodiimide chemistry that allows for a strong amide
bond formation between the amino groups of the antibody and the carboxylic
groups of the base electrode platform. The sensing signal, which is
the suppression of electric current, can easily be followed by the
SWV or EIS technique, the latter being more preferable as it is more
sensitive than the former. One of the findings is the ability of the
aged redox probe (ferri-/ferro-cyanide solution) to enhance the sensitivity
of the immunosensor for the detection of VCT. This observation, termed
the “Redox Probe Ageing-Induced Sensitivity Enhancement”
(“Redox-PrAISE”), highlights the importance of the nature
of the redox probe on the electrochemical sensing conditions when
designing impedimetric immunosensors. Further research is necessary
to investigate and apply this finding to other biological analytes.
In general, the immunosensor showed an excellent performance in terms
of sensitivity, selectivity, and regenerability: very low limits of
detection (ca. 1.2 × 10–13 g mL–1) and quantification (ca. 1.3 × 10–13 g mL–1) at a wide LCR of 8 orders of magnitude (10–13 to 10–5 g mL–1). When subjected
to a real sample application using cholera-infested water samples,
the immunosensors exhibited comparable or even better results than
the gold standard clinical culture method. This opens a new window
of opportunities for the optimization and potential application in
the point-of-care diagnosis of V. cholerae infection, especially in resource-limited countries plagued by the
constant occurrence of the cholera epidemic.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials and Reagents
The following
chemicals/specialty reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich: polyacrylonitrile
(PAN) polymer; N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF); glycine (PharmaGrade, Ajinomoto, EP, product no. G5417); anti-cholera
toxin antibody (Ab) produced in rabbit (delipidized, whole antiserum,
cat. no. C3062); VCT B subunit (from V. cholerae cat. no. C9903, 95% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis,
lyophilized powder), which is the antigen (Ag); (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide)hydrochloride
(EDC); N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (sulfo-NHS); Nafion
perfluorinated resin solution (5 wt % in lower aliphatic alcohols
and water; contains 15–20% water); and BSA (heat shock fraction,
pH 7, ≥98%). TCBS was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Ultra-pure
water of resistivity 18.2 M Ω cm was obtained from a Milli-Q
Water System (Millipore Corp. Bedford, MA, USA) and used throughout
for the preparation of solutions. All other reagents used in this
work were of pure analytical grade and used as received from the suppliers
without further purification. PBS containing sodium azide (0.025%,
m/v) and 1 mM EDTA (0.14 M PBS/AE, pH 7.4) was prepared following
our previous methods:35,37 briefly, sodium azide (0.025%,
m/v), 0.2922 g (1 mmol) EDTA, 0.2 g (1.5 mmol) KH2PO4, 1.05 g (7.4 mmol) Na2HPO4, 8.0 g (0.14
mol) NaCl, and 0.2 g (2.7 mmol) KCl were dissolved and made up to
1 L mark of the volumetric flask with ultra-pure water. The role of
the azide is to serves as a preservative, while EDTA is for disengaging
cells that may be attached to the containing vessels or clumped together.
The 0.1 M K4Fe(CN)6/K3Fe(CN)6 (1:1) mixture was prepared in 0.14 M PBS/AE, pH 7.4; typically,
1.6462 g (5 mmol) K3Fe(CN)6 and 2.1121 g (5
mmol) K4Fe(CN)6 were dissolved in 50 mL PBS/AE.

4.2 Preparation of Electrospun Carbon Nanofibres
Electrospun CNFs were obtained using the conventional electrospinning
technique.23,24 In this work, electrospinning
works were carried out using the KD Scientific model syringe pump
(KD Scientific Inc., USA). Briefly, 2 g of PAN polymer was weighed,
dispersed in 15 mL of 100% w/w DMF, and ultrasonicated for 20 min
at room temperature to allow for a thorough dissolution. The resulting
polymer solution was filled in the syringe to perform the conventional
electrospinning process at 10 kV power supply at room temperature.
The distance between the syringe point and the collector plate was
maintained at about 15 cm, while the flow rate of the polymer solution
was 0.6 mL/h. On completion, the fiber materials were removed from
the aluminum plate collector, then soaked in distilled deionized water
overnight (∼12 h) to extract or wash off the solvent (DMF),
and dried in an oven at 60 °C for 2 h to obtain a white fluffy
PAN fiber. Subsequently, the white PAN fiber material was stabilized
by heating at 300 °C for 3 h and finally carbonized at 800 °C
in an argon atmosphere for 7 h to obtain the CNFs. The typical scanning
electron microscopic (SEM) image (obtained from the Zeiss FIB-SEM
at the NMISA, Pretoria) of the CNFs (see the Supporting Information, Figure S1) comprises a mixture of agglomerated
fibers, mostly of the nano-sized dimensions (40–200 nm), with
few fibers reaching the micrometric dimensions.

4.3 Electrochemical Procedures
Electrochemical
experiments were carried out using an Autolab Potentiostat PGSTAT
100 (Eco Chemie, Utrecht, the Netherlands) powered by the 4.9 version
of GPES and FRA softwares. The working electrode was glassy carbon
disk electrode [GCE, Bioanalytical Systems (BAS), diameter = 3.0 mm]
modified with the CNF. A Pt rod was used as the counter electrode,
while Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) was used as the reference electrode. Both
CV and SWV were used. The following SWV parameters were used throughout
the work: frequency of 10 Hz, step potential of 5 mV, and amplitude
of 20 mV. EIS experiments were conducted using an Autolab frequency
response analyzer (FRA) software between 100 kHz and 10 mHz with the
amplitude (rms value) of the ac signal of 10 mV in a solution of 0.1
M K4Fe(CN)6/K3Fe(CN)6 (1:1)
mixture in 0.14 M PBS/AE (pH 7.4) and at the equilibrium potential
(E1/2) of the redox probe, [Fe(CN)6]3–/[Fe(CN)6]4– (∼0.126 V vs Ag|AgCl, 3 M KCl). The raw EIS experimental
data were fitted with the FRA software using the appropriate electrical
equivalent circuit models. All solutions were de-aerated by bubbling
pure nitrogen (Afrox, South Africa) prior to each electrochemical
experiment. All experiments were performed at room temperature.

4.4 Fabrication of the Electrochemical Immunosensor
The bare GCE was first thoroughly cleaned using slurries of aluminum
oxide nano-powder (50 nm, Sigma-Aldrich) on a Buehler felt pad, followed
by ultrasonic cleaning in ethanol and acetone to remove residual alumina
nano-powder and obtain a mirror-finish surface. The method of drop-drying
was used for the modification of GCE with the samples: 2 mg of the
CNF was dispersed in 2 mL DMF containing 20 μL 5% Nafion and
ultra-sonicated for about 30 min. Thereafter, 10 μL of the mixture
was drop-cast onto the GCE surface and slowly dried in oven at about
40 °C (abbreviated here as GCE–CNF). To remove carboxylated
carbonaceous fragments from the carboxyl functioning group (−COOH)
on the carbon surfaces, each of the GCE-modified surface was immersed
in a 2 M NaOH solution for 1 h at 40 °C and allowed to cool to
room temperature. The EDC/sulfo-NHS mixture (10 μL; 1:1 v/v
ratio) was dissolved in 2 mL PBS/AE (pH = 7.4) dropwise unto the surface
of the electrode. EDC serves as the coupling or cross-linking agent
that activates the −COOH (i.e., generating an o-acylisourea species, which is unstable in an aqueous solution),
while NHS assists in stabilizing this intermediate by converting it
to an amine-reactive ester (which is a more stable species) for the
coupling of the incoming −NH2 group of the V. cholerae antibody (Ab) to form a strong amide
(−NHCO−) bond.

Prior to the immobilization of
the Ab on the functionalized carbon surfaces, the as-received anticholera
toxin (Ab) was defrosted by removing from the refrigerator and allowed
to stand for about 30 min at room temperature. 25 μL of the
as-received Ab was diluted 5 times with PBS (1:5) and sonicated for
a few minutes. 10 μL (0.01 mg/mL in PBS/AE, pH 7.4, 10 mM) of
the solution was added dropwise on the surface of the functionalized
GCE-modified surfaces and incubated under humid condition overnight
at room temperature. This was followed by washing the electrode [swirling
gently or rinsing using a copious amount of PBS/AE (i.e., pH 7.4,
10 mM)] to remove the unbound antibody (the modified electrode is
abbreviated herein as GCE–CNF–Ab). Then, 10 μL
of BSA (0.01 mg/mL) was added to the surface of the electrode and
incubated for 4 h (abbreviated as “GCE–CNF–Ab–BSA”;
note that BSA was used to block nonspecific sites on the porous surface
of the electrode). Finally, the electrode was rinsed in PBS/AE and
doubly distilled and deionized water, dried using nitrogen stream,
used immediately, or stored in a refrigerator at 4 °C until needed
for electrochemical experiments. The BSA-modified electrode was used
for the electrochemical detection of the as-received cholera antigen/toxin
(VCT) at different concentrations/dilutions (notably from 45.5 μg/mL
to 130 ng/mL), using SWV and EIS. Different concentrations of VCT
were first prepared via serial dilutions from the stock solution and
stored at 4 °C when not in use.
