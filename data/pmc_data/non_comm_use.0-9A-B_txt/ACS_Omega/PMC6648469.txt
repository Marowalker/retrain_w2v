Long-term sensing
of dissolved oxygen in aqueous solution always suffers from adherence
of algae, barnacles, and clams and formation of biofilms on the sensor
surface, which strongly influences the diffusion of oxygen into the
sensor film. Metabolism of these adhered species consumes oxygen and
causes bias on sensor readout. Therefore, commercial sensors are equipped
with mechanical brushes to constantly clean the sensor surface, which
significantly complicates the sensor design and causes damage to the
sensor surface. In addition, extra energy storage and mechanical structures
are required, which make an optical sensor bulky and limit its service
life. We have developed a robust and highly sensitive dissolved oxygen
sensor with good mechanical stability and self-cleaning capability.
The sensor was fabricated by doping oxygen-sensitive probe PtTFPP
with superhydrophobic coating. The 3 to 5 nm micro/nanostructures
formed from silica sol were solidified with silicone resin, which
endowed the sensor film with excellent mechanical stability. The sensor
film exhibits antifouling, antiabrasion, and self-cleaning properties.
There is no need of mechanical brushes to clean sensor surfaces, which
greatly simplifies the sensor design. Owing to the porous structure,
the sensor shows high quenchability, with I0/I100 of 77. All these features guarantee
that the sensor could be used in harsh and dirty conditions for long-term
monitoring of dissolved oxygen concentration.

Introduction
Molecular oxygen is
probably one of the most important chemicals for life on earth. Continuously
measuring dissolved oxygen concentration has been proven vital to
many industrial areas, including fermentation, dense fish-farming,
long-distance transportation of natural gases, biofuel production,
biomedical bioreactors, marine research and exploration, and water
quality monitoring and pollution control, to name only the major applications.1−3 In early time, dissolved oxygen is mainly measured using a Clark
electrode and a Mackereth-type electrode.4 However, with decades of innovation, sensing of molecular oxygen
based on luminescence quenching has become one of the major methods
of choice, simply because of its high sensitivity, ease of system
setup, no consumption of oxygen during measurement, and remote sensing.
More importantly, as a fierce competition to the classic Clark and
Mackereth-type electrodes,5 luminescence
quenching-based optical oxygen sensors present a unique feature that
they could be easily sterilized without worrying about the connecting
cable. Such sensors could be glued inside the container, and signal
is readout remotely outside. This becomes extremely important for
fermentation and biomedical bioreactor applications, where complete
sterilization is the key to prevent contamination. The concentration
of dissolved oxygen has also been determined using Winkler titration
(mostly in an environmental monitoring sector), which is a quantitative
analytical method based on chemical reaction. However, this method
is not suitable for long-term and online monitoring of dissolved oxygen
because of its irreversibility in nature.

Optical sensors are
composed of a luminescent sensor film, an optical fiber, and a signal
analysis and readout system.1 The sensor
film is the key component in optical oxygen sensors, and it always
directly contacts with aqueous samples and senses variation of dissolved
oxygen concentration. This method has been successfully applied in
lots of fields, but is mostly used in clean aqueous solutions. However,
in real applications, there are microorganisms, algae, clams, and
other marine lives in the testing samples. Long-term use of an optical
oxygen sensor film in these samples will always result in growth of
algae, formation of biofilm, and adherence of shellfish,6 which will create a barrier for oxygen diffusion
in the sensor film. In addition,
metabolism of these adhered marine species also influences the local
oxygen concentration nearby the sensor film, due to which the dissolved
oxygen concentration in the sample could not be correctly measured.
In order to prevent adherence of biofilms, algae, and shellfish on
the sensing film, commercially available oxygen sensors (especially
sensors used in marine monitoring buoys) are equipped with brushes
to clean the sensor surface (typical products used in buoys from YSI
Inc., www.ysi.com). However,
the oxygen sensor materials are not wear-resistant. Continuous abrasion
during the brush-cleaning process damages the sensor film and significantly
reduces sensor performance and service life, resulting in increases
in maintenance frequency and costs. The addition of mechanical component
to drive the brush also complicates sensor design, increases sensor
cost, and makes the sensor bulky and heavy.

The innovation in
superhydrophobic materials provides extraordinary features that these
materials could be used as coatings to create antifouling7 and self-cleaning surfaces.8 Superhydrophobic surfaces rely on the formation of a thin
air layer that can decrease the attractive interactions between the
surface and the liquid and are inspired from natural nonwetting structures,
particularly the lotus leaf,9 one of green,
nontoxic, nonfouling surfaces.8,10,11 However, the major challenges of artificial superhydrophobic surfaces
for practical applications are their poor mechanical robustness and
difficulties in massive production. The superhydrophobic surface can
be formed via the classic top-down, bottom-up, or the combination
of both approaches, which require sophisticated fabrication and nanomaterial
synthesis process.12 The assignment of
micro/nanostructures on the surface of interest requires precise control
of the location at a microscopic scale, which strongly restricts the
massive production of the superhydrophobic surface. In addition, the
orderly arranged superhydrophobic surface based on the micro/nanostructures
is fragile and is highly susceptible to mechanical wear.13−16 These surfaces could be easily damaged during practical use. Notable
progress has been made over the past decade, and superhydrophobic
surface can now be formed via the robust sol–gel approach,
which greatly simplifies the fabrication process.12 However, majority of fabricating superhydrophobic surfaces
still rely on the adhesive layer to enhance its mechanical stability,15,17−20 and such a two-layer system is undesirable during practical coating.
Chen and co-workers developed a large-scale fabrication method for
robust hydrophobic surface coating with high rigidity and good flexibility.21 Superhydrophobic sol was first fabricated via
a one-pot reaction, which was then mixed with silicone resin and applied
directly on the surface of interest via routine coating processes.
The fabricated superhydrophobic surface exhibits good flexibility,
high rigidity, and good mechanical stability.

Because of the
superhydrophobic nature and porous structure, superhydrophobic coating
could be an ideal material for oxygen sensing because it exhibits
excellent oxygen permeability. However, only few attempts have been
made to use superhydrophobic coating for oxygen sensing. Mitsuishi
and co-workers22 covalently immobilized
an oxygen-sensitive probe PtTPP on an amphiphilic acrylamide-based
copolymer and cast the copolymer with another fluoropolymer to form
a nanoparticle-based superhydrophobic surface. The fabricated oxygen
sensor film exhibited high quenchability, with an I0/I100 over 120, which could
be attributed that the probe is directly exposed to the surface and
is in direct contact with molecular oxygen. However, fabrication of
the sensor requires tedious copolymer synthesis and dye labeling,
and the nanoparticle-based superhydrophobic surface may easily be
damaged from mechanical abrasion.

In this work, we have developed
a highly sensitive dissolved oxygen sensor with excellent mechanical
stability and self-cleaning capability. The sensor is composed of
micro/nanohierarchical structured superhydrophobic coating that is
doped with an oxygen-sensitive probe. The hierarchical structure was
then solidified using silicone resin to endow the sensor film with
good mechanical stability. After tape-peeling, intensive scratching,
and sandpaper abrasion, the sensor film still maintains good superhydrophobic
nature with contact angle (CA) larger than 150°. Owing to the
porous structure and high gas permeability of silicone resin, the
sensor showed excellent quenchability toward oxygen quenching with I0/I100 over 77.
Because of its superhydrophobic property, algae, biofilms, and clams
are difficult to adhere on the surface of the sensing film. This feature
keeps the sensor surface clean over long-term usage, and there is
no need to install cleaning brushes, which will make sensor design
much simple, more energy-saving, and with largely extended service
life. Moreover, the fabrication of the sensor film is very simple,
and there is no sophisticated synthesis and fabrication technique
involved, which could be applied for massive production.

Results and Discussion
The preparation of the sensor film is very simple and straightforward,
and there is no sophisticated preparation and nanofabrication involved.
Silica nanoparticles with a size of 3–5 nm were synthesized
via a classic Stöber method, and their surface is then modified
with γ-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) to form aggregates.
These irregular shapes of aggregates form micro/nanohierarchical structures.
Then, hydrophobic 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane (PFOTS)
was used to lower the surface energy. Finally, the oxygen-sensitive
dye PtTFPP and the hydrophobic silica sol were mixed with silicone
resin to form a viscous mixture. The mixture was then coated onto
a glass slide to form the sensor film. Figure 1a shows three
drops of water on the sensor surface, which are perfect spherical
water droplets formed with a CA of 168°, illustrating the superhydrophobic
nature of the sensor surface. Low surface energy and micro/nanostructures
are two essential physical ingredients to prepare the superhydrophobic
surface.16Figure 1c,d shows the scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images of the sensor film with small and large magnification,
respectively. It is obvious that numerous silica nanoparticles are
gathered together to form the micro/nanohierarchical structures. The
unique structure helps trapping a thin layer of air that decreases
attractive interactions between the solid surface and liquid, leading
to superhydrophobicity. Besides, the sensor also exhibits a fractal-like
porous structure, which is also important to enhance the hydrophobicity.23 In addition, the sensor surface shows a CA of
145° for methylene iodide (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information), revealing that the sensor surface
has low adherence to oil. The calculated surface-free energy was 0.54 ± 0.07 mN/m, indicating that the
sensor could not only prevent contamination and adherence of marine
life, but also avoid adherence of organic pollutants. These properties
would be very useful when the sensor was applied for oxygen monitoring
in the area where accidental oil spilling happens.

Figure 1 (a) Photograph of three
water droplets on the sensor film. The doping of oxygen-sensitive
probe PtTFPP gives the sensor film a pink color. (b) Water droplets
on the sensor film exhibits a CA of 168.85°, indicating the superhydrophobic
property of the sensor surface. (c,d) SEM images of the sensor surface
with low and high magnification; the sensor exhibits rough surface
with a micro/nanohierarchical structure, which is the basic framework
for the superhydrophobic surface. The silica sols were firmly immobilized
by silicone resin, which guarantee the mechanical stability and preserve
the superhydrophobic property over long-term use at harsh conditions.

Figure 2 shows the surface properties of the sensor
film after continuous tape peeling, knife scratching, and sandpaper
abrasions. The resistance to these external destructions, even in
exceptionally harsh conditions, is important in real applications.
The current major challenge for practical application is its poor
mechanical robustness.15,16 To evaluate the mechanical robustness,
we first implemented the tape-peeling test for the sensor film.24 As shown in Figure 2a,b, after 10 cycles of tape peeling, ignorable
effects in superhydrophobicity occurred. The CA of the sensor film
slightly declines from 167.6° to 165.7°, and the sliding
angle (SA) slightly increases from 2° to 4°. It seems that
the increases of SA are related to the decreases of CA. Continuing
to 40 cycles, the sensor still reserves its superhydrophobicity. The
SEM images of the sensor surface before and after 40 cycles of repetitive
tape peeling indicate no obvious surface morphology change (see Figure
S2 in the Supporting Information). We also
performed a knife scratching test according to the ASTM standard.
Figure S3 in the Supporting Information showed that the sensor was well adhered to the supporting matrix.
Even after knife scratching with observable crack, the sensor surface
maintains its superhydrophobic property with a CA of 162°. We
further challenged the sensor surface with a sandpaper abrasion test.15Figure 2c shows the schematic of the sandpaper abrasion test; the
samples were placed face-down to the sandpaper (240#) under a loading
of 100 g and moved along the ruler at a constant speed. A 10 cm abrasion
test was defined as one cycle. As summarized in Figure 2d, the sensor preserves its superhydrophobic
nature even after 40 cycles of sandpaper abrasion; the CAs were all
above 150°. All this information proves the good mechanical stability
of the sensor film.

Figure 2 (a) Illustration of the tape-peeling test with 4 kg of
loading weight. (b) CAs and SAs measured after different cycles; the
sensor surface maintains its superhydrophobic property even after
40 cycles of tape peeling, indicating that the surface has good mechanical
stability over tape peeling. (c) Scheme of one cycle of the sandpaper
abrasion (240 grit) test with 100 g of loading weight and a moving
distance of 10 cm. (d) CAs of the sensor surface after continuous
sandpaper abrasion. The superhydrophobic property was preserved after
harsh sandpaper abrasion test, proving the great mechanical stability
of the sensor surface.

The superhydrophobic sensor surface also exhibits self-cleaning
capability. As shown in Figure 3, the sensor film was placed with a tilting angle of 5°,
and manganese dioxide power was put on the sensor surface as manual
dirt. When one drop of water containing CuSO4 (as colorant) slides
over the MnO2 powder, the powder dirt is removed from the
sensor surface. There is no adherence and remains of dirt on the sensor
surface, demonstrating that the sensor film possesses good self-cleaning
capability. In comparison, the hydrophobic sensor surface without
superhydrophobic property does not have self-cleaning capability,
as shown in Figure S4.

Figure 3 Self-cleaning property
of the sensor film. The sensor film was placed at a tilting angle
of 5°, and MnO2 powder was used as manual dirt. When
a drop of water containing CuSO4 passes through the dirt,
the surface remains clean.

We further studied the distribution of oxygen-sensitive probe
PtTFPP in the sensor film. As shown in Figure S5 in the Supporting Information, elemental analysis and
imaging reveal that the probes (Pt distribution) are evenly distributed
in the superhydrophobic sensor film and there is no obvious aggregation
observed. More importantly, the sensor film is semitransparent, and
the rough surface could scatter excitation light, resulting more efficient
excitation of the oxygen-sensitive probe and enhanced brightness of
the sensor film. Figure 4a shows the luminescence spectra of the sensor film at three different
dissolved oxygen concentrations. It is obvious that molecular oxygen
could efficiently quench the luminescence of PtTFPP in the superhydrophobic
film. The quenchability (expressed as I0/I100, which stands for the intensity
measured in an oxygen-free solution and in a pure oxygen saturated
solution, respectively) of the sensor reaches 77. The time trace curve
reveals that the sensor could measure dissolved oxygen concentration
in the range of 0–20 mg/L, which is shown in Figure 4b. The response time is less
than 6 s. (The response time is defined as the time required for the
intensity to decrease to 90% of the equilibrium value. Note that the
response time is measured in gas phase, as it is difficult to control
the filling time of the flow-through cell, Figure S6 in the Supporting Information.)

Figure 4 (a) Emission spectra
of oxygen sensors at three different dissolved oxygen concentrations.
Molecular oxygen efficiently quenched the luminescence of PtTFPP in
the sensor matrix. (b) Response of sensor at different dissolved oxygen
concentrations and its reversibility. The sensors exhibit high quenchability
and full reversibility; the luminescence intensity was monitored at
650 nm. (c) Stern–Volmer plot of oxygen sensors as a function
of dissolved oxygen concentration. (d) Photostability of oxygen sensors.

The high quenchability and fast
response could be attributed to the porous structure of the sensor
film and good gas permeability of silicone. Such kind of porous silica
structure has been proved to be a good matrix for highly sensitive
oxygen sensors.25−29 The sensor response is fully reversible, which guarantees monitoring
of oxygen concentration variation over long term. The almost linear
Stern–Volmer plot shown in Figure 4c further proves that the oxygen-sensitive
probes are uniformly distributed in the sensor film. The Stern–Volmer
constant is 2.65 L/mg. The linear calibration curve is beneficial
for two-point calibration and significantly simple sensor calibration
process and data analysis.

More importantly, the sensor shows
excellent photostability as shown in Figure 4d. The sensor was exposed to intense illumination
at 395 nm with a power density of 13.2 W/m2; there is no
more than 10% of intensity loss after 1 h of exposure. In addition,
the sensor film is fully compatible with a commercial optical oxygen
meter, which uses much weaker illumination from light-emitting diodes
and measures phase difference rather than luminescence intensity.
The influences of photobleaching on sensor performance could be easily
eliminated. All these features confirm that the sensor has good quenchability,
fast response, and good stability, which is suitable for long-term
monitoring of dissolved oxygen.

The sensor film was finally
tested for its antifouling property. We have compared the adherence
of Navicula pelliculosa on four different
surfaces, including polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), polystyrene, polyethylene
terephthalate (PET), and the superhydrophobic sensor film. All the
films were immersed in a suspension of Navicula pelliculosa for 48 h and then their surfaces were washed with water. After drying
at room temperature, the Navicula pelliculosa on the surface was imaged via autofluorescence of chlorophyll on
the fluorescence microscope.30 The chlorophyll
was excited in the wavelength range of 595–645 nm, and the
emission was recorded in the range of 665–715 nm. Figure 5 shows the overlay
images of bright-field image and autofluorescence image of Navicula pelliculosa. Results show that Navicula pelliculosa could adhere to all surfaces
tested. Statistic results show that there are 40 ± 16.2, 1760
± 165.1, 1346 ± 369.9, and 786 ± 136.8 Navicula pelliculosa per square millimeter attached
on the superhydrophobic sensor film, PDMS, polystyrene, and PET support,
respectively. Obviously, the superhydrophobic sensor film exhibits
much less attachment of Navicula pelliculosa. Close observation could conclude that Navicula pelliculosa is mainly trapped in the hole of micro/nanostructure and could easily
be washed away with repetitive washing steps. However, the adhered Navicula pelliculosa on PDMS, polystyrene, and PET
surface attached firmly and could not be easily removed via a simple
washing step. These results further demonstrate that the superhydrophobic
sensor film shows excellent antifouling property.

Conclusions
We have developed a highly sensitive oxygen
sensor film with good mechanical stability and antifouling and self-cleaning
properties. The sensor film was simply fabricated by doping the oxygen-sensitive
probe PtTFPP in superhydrophobic sol suspension and cast along with
silicone resin to form superhydrophobic micro/nanohierarchical structures.
Because of the unique porous structure, the sensor film shows fully
reversible response toward oxygen quenching, and quenchability (expressed
as I0/I100) is as high as 77. The oxygen-sensitive probes are firmly encapsulated
and uniformly distributed inside the hydrophobic coating so that they
do not leach and aggregate. Extensive wear-resistant tests (including
continuous tape peeling, knife scratching, and sandpaper abrasions)
prove that the sensor film has excellent mechanical stability. More
importantly, the sensor film shows excellent antifouling and self-cleaning
properties, on which the formation of biofilms and adherence of clams
and other marine lives could be minimized. Because of its simple fabrication
procedure, this kind of superhydrophobic sensor film could be massively
produced. The antifouling and self-cleaning properties of the sensor
film greatly simplifies sensor design. A compact sensor could be fabricated
without using mechanical cleaning brushes, which significantly reduces
sensor cost, maintenance frequency and cost, and extends sensor service
life. All these properties endow that the sensor film could be used
in harsh and dirty conditions and for long-term monitoring of oxygen
concentration without worrying about the influences of surface contamination.

Experimental
Section
Materials
All reagents were commercially available
and used as received without further purification. PFOTS, tetraethoxysilane
(TEOS), APTES, and absolute ethanol were provided by Aladdin-Reagent
Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China. Ammonium hydroxide (≥25 wt %, NH3·H2O) was obtained from Jiangsu Tong Sheng
Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. The oxygen-sensitive probe PtTFPP was synthesized
by Heowns Inc (www.heowns.cn, Tianjin, China). The methyl silicone resin was purchased from High
Chemical (Shanghai) International Trade Co., Ltd., China. The PDMS
was purchased from Wacker (http://www.drawin.com). Toluene was obtained from Tansoole (http://www.tansoole.com). Polystyrene
(average MW 260 000) was bought from J&K Chemical Ltd.
(http://www.jkchemical.com). A transparent PET film was obtained from Goodfellow (http://www.goodfellow.com). Navicula pelliculosa (106 cells/mL) was
purchased from Freshwater Algae Culture Collection at the Institute
of Hydrobiology (FACHB, algae.ihb.ac.cn).

Coating Preparation
Preparation of Coating Solution
First, H2O (2.14 g), NH3·H2O (0.152 g), and TEOS (1.56 g) were dissolved in 25 mL of anhydrous
alcohol. After the solution was stirred 3 h at 40 °C, its pH
was adjusted to 4 by dropping acetic acid. Second, APTES (0.15 g)
was added to the above solution and then stirred 40 min at 40 °C.
Then, PFOTS (0.33 g) was added. The solution was stirred for 2 h at
room temperature to form solution A. Lastly, PtTFPP (5 mg) was dissolved
to anhydrous alcohol (0.5 mL) to form solution B.

Preparation
of Superhydrophobic Coatings
Prior to coating treatment,
solutions A (6 g) and B (1 mL) and methyl silicone resin (1 g) were
mixed together at room temperature to form a coating solution. The
samples were flowed with the as-prepared coating solution and then
cured at 80 °C for 2 h.

Antifouling Test
The initial density of Navicula pelliculosa for antifouling test was 106 cells/mL. The temperature
of cultural media was controlled at 25 °C. For comparison, PDMS
sensor film, polystyrene film, and bare PET foil were tested for their
antifouling properties. The concentration of PtTFPP was 2 mg/mL in
ethanol. The PDMS sensor film was prepared by mixing PDMS (0.5 g/mL
in toluene) and PtTFPP solution at a volume ration of 4:1. The formed
viscous mixture was spread onto the transparent PET support using
a homemade knife-coating device with a wet thickness of 125 μm.
Polystyrene sensor film was prepared in the same way. The only difference
is that the concentration of polystyrene solution is 10% (w/w) in
toluene. The thickness of all dried sensor layers was around 4 μm.

Characterizations
SEM was performed to determine surface
morphology using a HITACHI S4800 Field Emission SEM at an accelerating
voltage of 5 kV. Before being imaged, the samples were sputtered with
a thin layer of Au. The element distribution was analyzed by energy-dispersive
X-ray analysis. The water CAs and SAs were measured by using an optical
CA measuring device (DSA100, Kruss, Germany). The CAs are the mean
of three independent measurements with 5 μL of water or 2 μL
of methyl iodide on different locations applying a Young–Laplace
fitting. The surface-free energy was calculated by the software in
DSA100 based on the water (polar) and methylene iodide (nonpolar)
CAs. To measure the SAs, the slides were tilted step by step (1°)
with respect to the horizontal plane until a water droplet starts
to slide along the surface.

Surface robustness includes tape
peel tests and sandpaper abrasion tests. Two kinds of tape peel tests
were employed according to the previous literature.15,24 First, repetitive tape application and peel-off cycles were applied
by rolling a 4 kg steel roller. After each 10 cycles, water CA and
SA were measured. Second, the surface adhesion was tested using the
ASTM standard. In this test, 11 cuts are made in two directions using
a knife at right angles to each other to form a grid of small squares.
A 3 M adhesive tape is applied over the grid and removed by pulling
in a single smooth action. For sandpaper abrasion tests, the treated
coating was placed face-down to the sandpaper (grit no. 240) and was
moved 10 cm along a ruler at a constant speed under a 100 g load.
The 10 cm abrasion test was defined as one cycle. After each cycle,
the water CA was measured.

The response of the sensor film to
dissolved oxygen was conducted using a homemade flow-through cell
(Figure S6 in the Supporting Information). The concentration of dissolved oxygen was controlled by saturating
distilled water with a premixed synthetic gas. The oxygen concentration
in the synthetic gas was precisely controlled by two mass flow controllers
(Red-Y, http://www.voegtlin.com, Switzerland). The sensor film was fixed in the flow-through cell,
and excitation light at 395 nm was guided to the cell via a Y-shape
optical quartz fiber. The measured illumination intensity at the fiber
tip is 0.26 mW. The red emission of the sensor film was guide back
via the same fiber and the luminescence intensity is measured on the
fluorospectrometer (Hitachi F-7000, Japan). The excitation and emission
slits were both set at 5 nm. The voltage of the photomultiplier tube
in the fluorospectrometer was set at 400 V.
