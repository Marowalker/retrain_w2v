Efficient structured catalysts of
partial methane oxidation into
synthesis gas were obtained by electrochemical modification of the
surface of sintered FeCrAl alloy fibers in an ionic liquid BMIM-NTf2 with further introduction of platinum nanoparticles. It was
shown that etching and electrochemical modification of sintered FeCrAl
alloy fibers result in a decrease of the surface aluminum content.
With an increase of the reaction temperature to 900 °C, the methane
conversion reaches 90% and the selectivity to CO increases significantly
to achieve 98%. The catalysts with a Pt loading of 1 × 10–4 wt % demonstrate high activity and selectivity as
well as TOF in synthesis gas production by the CH4 + O2 reaction at 850–900 °C. To trace the composition
and structure evolution of the catalysts, XRD and SEM methods were
used.

1 Introduction
The reaction of partial
oxidation of methane into synthesis gas
(POM) rendering the molar ratio H2/CO = 2 in the products
is considered as a valuable alternative to methane steam reforming
and one of the reactions in the so-called “trireforming”
process.1,2 The mechanism of POM depends on the nature
of the catalytic active phase, its dispersion, and oxidation state,
thus influencing the selectivity of the catalytic process.3 Moreover, the reaction is highly exothermic,
and a perfect control of the thermal regime is required for the process
efficiency.

The heat exchange between the catalyst and the reaction
gas mixture
can be significantly improved by applying a catalytic carrier with
a high thermal conductivity, such as structured metal supports: metallic
gauzes, foils, foams, and fibers. They present also developed surface
area and high thermal and mechanical stability combined with an open
structure allowing a low pressure drop through the catalytic bed.4 Among such carriers, the recently studied Fe-Cr-Al
(FeCrAl alloy) sintered metal fibers (SMF) of porous sheets5−8 formed by uniform microsized filaments present high porosities up
to 80–90%. Since the original FeCrAl alloy SMFs do not have
sufficient surface area (the SSA may reach 1–2 m2/g only), the application of this material as a carrier requires
surface modification that may be achieved by special treatment, for
instance, by high-temperature oxidation or acid treatment.2−9 The enhancement of the specific surface area of the metallic carrier
is beneficial for supporting active metals at high dispersion.

Surface treatment of metals by IL under the electrochemical control
is known to result in the formation of surface nanostructures (cells,
nanotubes, etc.).10,11 Unlike the high-temperature treatment,
this method of modification can be used at room temperature, and the
surface organization can be controlled by using different parameters,
such as the current, potential, addition of chemical agents, and time
of treatment.

Another important issue for efficiency of POM
process is the catalyst
resistance toward coke formation.12 Coking
leads not only to catalyst deactivation but increases the pressure
drop through the catalytic bed diminishing the POM process efficiency.
In this concern, the metallic structured catalysts are robust alternative
to bulk catalysts.1,2 The use of the open structure
of sintered metal fibers with their surface being coated with a porous
oxide layer serving as a carrier for metal nanoparticles should result
in a suppression of the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation.

It was shown13 that the product yields
in the POM reaction on a Pt/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst
prepared by impregnation with an aqueous solution of PtCl4 is virtually independent of the platinum loading. Electrochemical
methods of metal deposition, including noble metals, like platinum,
exhibit a number of advantages, in addition to the energy economy,
compared to other methods of preparation of supported metal catalysts.
First, by varying the current or potential, one can prepare deposits
with a controlled dispersion on the electrode surface. Second, ultralow
loaded metal deposits (lower than 0.05–0.1 wt %) can be obtained.
Finally, the amount of deposited metal can be easily controlled and
calculated on the basis of the Faraday law.

The goal of this
research is the development of an efficient structured
catalyst based on FeCrAl-alloy SMF. The catalyst was prepared by electrochemical
modification of SMF in an ionic liquid followed by electrochemical
deposition of platinum. The obtained catalysts were characterized
by different physicochemical methods, and their catalytic properties
were tested in the methane oxidation to synthesis gas.

2 Results and Discussion
The electrochemical modification
of the surface of sintered metal
fibers in an ionic liquid has been studied in detail.14 It has been found that anodic modification affects the
formation of surface nanostructures in different ways. In the case
of SMF1, the increase of the current and time of anodization results
in electrochemical etching, whereas in the case of SMF2, the surface
polishing takes place. The process of etching of the original FeCrAl
sample in an acid may influence the depth of the natural surface oxide
layer, thereby affecting the specific surface area of the carrier
and adhesion of the deposits.15

The
use of the slope of the transient (the E–t dependence) in the starting time interval (up to 10 ms)16,17 allows one to estimate the thickness of the surface oxide layer
on the metal by the formula 1  where δ is the thickness
of the layer, ε is the dielectric constant, ε0 is the dielectric constant of vacuum, and C is
the capacity. The capacity was determined from the transient as the
ratio q/ΔE for the starting
linear segment of the E–t dependence.

Three oxide layers have been observed on the surface
of FeCrAl
by transmission electron microscopy:17 the
outer layer of Al2O3, the middle layer of Al1.98Cr0.02O3, and the deep layer of AlFeO3. The surface oxide on FeCrAl represents not a simple oxide
but a mixture of several phases; therefore, determination of the ε
value is a problem. Thus, it seems reasonable to determine not the
δ value but the variation of the thickness upon different treatments.

It is possible to estimate the variation of the thickness of the
oxide layer arising as a result of modification of the surface of
SMF1 by anodization in ionic liquid using the dependences presented
in Figure 1 (inset).
The ratio of the thickness of the original oxide layer to the thickness
after the modification (δ0/δ1) is
1.3. The thickness of the surface oxide layer is decreased by ∼25%.
Compared to the sample SMF1, the thickness of the surface oxide layer
after the treatment in HCl (sample SMF2) is reduced by 25%. On the
contrary, for the sample SMF2, the anodization in the ionic liquid
results in an increase in the thickness of the surface oxide layer
by 50%.

Figure 1 Electrochemical behavior of SMF samples: voltammograms (I–E dependences) for sample SMF1
in a 1% aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 acidified
with HCl to pH = 1, sweep rate 1 mV/s. Inset: transients (E–t-dependences) at a constant current
of I = 8 mA for the unmodified sample SMF1 and for
the modified (I = 8 mA, t = 300
s) sample SMF2 in BMIM-NTf2.

Table 1 summarizes
the data on the surface composition of the original sample (SMF1),
the sample SMF1 treated in HCl (sample SMF2), and the sample SMF2
modified by anodization in the ionic liquid (IL).14

The chemical etching and electrochemical modification of sintered
FeCrAl fibers in the ionic liquid result in a decrease in the surface
content of aluminum and, as a result, an increase in the relative
content of molybdenum (Table 1). The XPS study of the original and modified (with platinum)
materials revealed two states of iron in all the samples under study:
Fe0 and Fe2O3 and/or Fe3O4, whereas chromium is present in the state Cr2O3 and/or CrO2. Thus, it has been established
that the surface of SMF is covered with iron and chromium oxides.
Fe2O3 and Cr2O3 are known
to be poorly soluble in hydrochloric acid. Hydrogen released upon
the dissolution of Fe0 may cause reduction and dissolution
of iron oxide. This results in a decrease in the depth of the surface
oxide layer after etching with hydrochloric acid. In the case of ionic
liquids, the anodic behavior of metals is different from that in aqueous
solutions.14

In order to investigate
the process of electrodeposition of platinum
on FeCrAl from a 1 wt % aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 acidified with HCl, cyclic voltammograms of the samples were
measured (Figure 1).
The low sweep rate for the potential of the working electrode provides
a quasi-stationary profile of the current and the potential. The value
of the initial potential (E = 0.9 V) excludes the
possibility of spontaneous deposition of platinum. The slow variation
of the potential in the range of 0.9–0.35 V corresponds to
the limiting stage of the mass transfer.18 The fast decrease of the current at potentials below 0.35 V corresponds
to the platinum deposition. The cathodic and anodic branches of the
voltammograms demonstrate a hysteresis. The anodic branch is higher
than the cathodic branch, which is typically related to the electrochemical
formation and growth of a new phase after nucleation.

The original
samples SMF1, SMF2, and the samples obtained from
SMF1 and SMF2 after modification with BMIM-NTf2 were applied further
as carriers for electrochemical deposition of Pt. The catalytic tests
of samples SMF1 and SMF2 after Pt deposition were depicted elsewhere.14 The images of the surfaces of the original carriers
SMF1 and SMF2 and the corresponding Pt catalysts produced using these
carriers (after modification with BMIM-NTf2) at different currents
and time intervals of platinum deposition are shown in Figures 2 and 3.

Figure 2 SEM images of the original FeCrAl sample (SMF1) (a) and the samples
obtained from SMF1 after modification with BMIM-NTf2 and
further electrochemical deposition of platinum at different currents
and time intervals: (b) i = −2.7 mA/cm2, t = 300 s; (c) i = −4
mA/cm2, t = 300 s; (d) i = −40 mA/cm2, t = 20 s; (e) i = −80 mA/cm2, t = 10
s. Insets for panels (b) and (e): Pt particle size distributions.

Figure 3 SEM images of the starting sample SMF2 (a) and the samples
obtained
from SMF2 after modification with BMIM-NTf2 and further
and after electrochemical deposition of platinum at different currents
and time intervals: (b) i = −0.05 mA/cm2, t = 20 s (inset: Pt particle size distribution);
(c) i = −5 mA/cm2, t = 20 s; (d) i = −80 mA/cm2, t = 10 s.

It is seen that the coverage
of the surface by platinum increases
with the increase of the current density. The lower the current density,
the lower is the concentration of two-dimensional nuclei formed at
the surface. At a very low current density, it is possible to assume
the formation only of the two-dimensional nucleus that further grows
to cover the entire surface of the cathode (Figure 3b,c). When the current density increases
and the concentration of ad-ions grows, the number of two-dimensional
nuclei increases too. The high current density provides a sufficient
overpotential at the electrode and, as a result, a larger number of
nuclei14 (Figure 2e,f,d).

The size of Pt particles on
initial catalysts was determined by
electron microscopy. Figure 3b (inset) demonstrates the Pt particle size distribution for
the catalyst containing 1 × 10–4 wt % Pt (b).

An increase of the current leads to the formation of larger agglomerates
with a size of 1000–1500 nm (25% of the total number of Pt
particles) (Figure 2d,e). However, the share of the particles with a smaller size is
significant: 35% of 250–270 nm and 35% of 100–140 nm
(Figure 2d). The distribution
was determined using 225 Pt particles. For the sample SMF2 (Figure 3), a similar pattern
is observed, that is, agglomeration of Pt particles on the catalyst
with the formation of large Pt agglomerates of microsize.

The
platinum dispersion (D) can be calculated
by the formula 2  where Ca is the
surface concentration of metal equal to 1.31 ×
1019 atoms per 1 m2, MPt is the mass of the Pt atom (g mol–1),
ρ is the volume density of platinum, 21.09 × 106 g M–3, N is Avogadro’s
number, D is the metal dispersion, and dp is the diameter of nanoparticles approximated as semispheres.19 For Pt nanoparticles with a mean diameter of
70 nm, the dispersion is 1.7%. For the catalyst 1 × 10–4% Pt/SMF2, platinum particles represent agglomerates with a size
of about 10 nm, which corresponds to a dispersion of about 13%. According
to the XPS data, platinum is present in the Pt0 state.

Figure 4 demonstrates
the characteristics of the partial methane oxidation reaction for
the carrier (SMF2) and the composite catalyst 1 × 10–4 wt % Pt/SMF2.

Figure 4 Dependence of the methane conversion (%) and the H2/CO
molar ratio for the carrier SMF2 (1, 3, respectively) and the composite
catalyst 1 × 10–4% Pt/SMF2 (2, 4, respectively)
vs temperature. Reaction conditions: VHSV of the mixture at the molar
ratio O2/CH4 = 0.48 was 8000 h–1.

It is seen from Figure 4 that the FeCrAl carrier exhibits
some catalytic activity.
The activity of the composite catalyst increases drastically above
800 °C, and the reaction proceeds with the formation of the optimal
H2/CO mixture close to the molar ratio of 2.

Table 2 summarizes
the results of the catalytic tests in the reaction of partial methane
oxidation into synthesis gas on the catalysts with a different platinum
loading on the carriers SMF1 and SMF2.

c Calculated as the number of CH4 molecules converted per
1 atom of loaded platinum per second.

It follows from the data of Table 2 that the original and modified FeCrAl carriers
(SMF1
and SMF2) exhibit some activity in the POM reaction. The methane conversion
on the unmodified metal carriers reached 30–50% with the selectivity
toward CO about 70–80%. The conversion can be increased to
90–95% at a higher temperature (1000-1100 °C); however,
the metallic carriers start to destroy under such severe conditions.
Etching of the SMF surface results in an increase of the methane conversion
and selectivity to CO. Presumably, this is caused by an increase of
the specific surface area of the carrier (SMF2) after the HCl treatment
as compared to the unmodified sample SMF1 (Figures 2a and 3a). Deposition
of platinum results in an increase of the catalytic activity. The
samples containing 1 × 10–4 and 3.1 ×
10–4% Pt on SMF2 demonstrate exceptionally high
specific activity (per gram of platinum) as compared to the samples
with higher Pt loadings (Table 2). For these catalysts, the molar ratio H2/CO is
close to 2, being suitable for methanol synthesis (Figure 4). The higher catalytic activity
of these catalysts is likely due to a higher Pt metal dispersion.
In the case of the 1 × 10–4% Pt/SMF2 catalyst
(inset in Figure 3b),
platinum particles represent agglomerates of smaller nanoparticles,
which corresponds to a dispersion of about 13% (compared with a dispersion
of 1.7% for 0.2% Pt/SMF1). It was shown19 for palladium composite catalysts with metal dispersion ranging
from 11 to 30% that the maximum specific catalytic activity in the
reaction of methane conversion is observed at a dispersion of 18%.

The corrosion behavior of FeCrAl alloys at high temperatures in
O2 or O2 + H2O media has been studied
recently in detail.20,21 It has been shown that the surface
of the FeCrAl alloy is covered by an aluminum oxide (corundum) layer
formed at high temperatures protecting the alloy from progressive
corrosion.20,21 According to the data of Tables 1 and 3, the surface aluminum content in the samples under study
is very low (below 1%). Iron and chromium oxides are present at the
surface. Figure 5a,b
presents SEM images of the areas of the alloy surface after catalysis. Table 3 summarizes the data
on the surface contents of certain elements in the cell with sizes
of 10 μm × 10 μm × 1 μm for the spent
catalyst shown in Figure 5.

a The content of Pt after the catalytic
tests decreases insignificantly and is about 7 × 10–4 wt % for both samples.

It follows from Table 3 that the catalytic reaction is accompanied by a negligible
soot formation if compared to the conventional granulated Pt catalysts
on porous supports. Indeed, the carbon content is about 1.5 wt % only.
Typically, the coke content in the catalyst under conditions of partial
methane oxidation or reforming (steam or dry reforming) may reach
15–30 wt %.22 A possible reason
behind the low coke formation in the case of the structured catalysts
is the process of fouling of coke precursors due to the open structure
of the catalysts.23

3 Conclusions
1. The electrochemical
modification of
the surface of sintered FeCrAl alloy fibers in an ionic liquid was
studied for the first time. It was found that the depth of the surface
oxide layer after the anodization in the ionic liquid decreases for
the sample that was not preliminarily treated with hydrochloric acid.
For the pretreated fibers under the same conditions, the depth of
the surface oxide layer increases. Etching and electrochemical modification
of sintered FeCrAl alloy fibers result in a decrease of the surface
aluminum content.

2. At
low temperatures (700 °C),
methane is mainly oxidized on the FeCrAl catalysts with or without
platinum to produce CO2. With an increase of the reaction
temperature to 900°C, the methane conversion increases by about
4 times with a significant increase of the selectivity to CO up to
98%.

3. The catalysts with
a Pt loading of
1 × 10–4 wt % Pt demonstrated complete methane
conversion, with the synthesis gas composition of H2/CO
= 2 being suitable for the downstream methanol synthesis. The TOF
value for this catalyst exceeds the TOFs for other samples by 1–3
orders of magnitude.

4. The structured Pt catalysts based on
sintered FeCrAl alloy fibers demonstrate a very low coke formation
contrary to the supported granulated Pt catalysts.



4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Preparation
of Catalysts
Sintered
FeCrAl metal fibers (SMFs) with a composition of Fe(73)Cr(20)Al(5)
pressed (shaped) in the form of sheets (30 × 60 mm, thickness
0.29 mm, Southwest Screens & Filters SA, Belgium), a fiber diameter
of 0.02 mm, open porosity of 0.7, specific surface area (Ar) of 2
m2/g were used for the preparation of catalysts.

The original sintered metal fibers (SMF1) and the samples treated
for 15 min with concentrated HCl for comparison (SMF2) were used for
supporting platinum by electrochemical deposition.

Electrochemical
studies were carried out using an Autolab PGSTAT302N
potentiostat. Electrochemical anodization was performed in a three-electrode
electrochemical cell in air at room temperature. Ionic liquid (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
bis(triflate)imide, BMIM-NTf2, purity 99%, the water content
220 ppm) was supplied by ABCR GmbH. SMF sheets, either pretreated
in HCl or untreated samples with the surface of S = 15 cm2, served as the working electrode (anode). A
stainless-steel plate (S = 15 cm2) was
used as an auxiliary electrode. Silver wire was applied as a reference
electrode. Electrochemical oxidation was carried out at a constant
current of I = 60 mA for 60, 300, 600, or 900 s.
Then the electrodes were washed with bidistillate water and acetone
and dried until constant weight. The procedure for the electrochemical
modification of the surface of samples SMF1 and SMF2 in ionic liquids
under conditions of the anodization with variation of the time and
current of the treatment resulting in the formation of a diversity
of nanostructures at the surface was described elsewhere.14 In the studies with ionic liquid, platinum and
silver wire were used as an auxiliary electrode and a quasi-reversible
reference electrode, respectively. The potential of the silver wire
was constantly calibrated versus a standard fc/fc+ electrode.

The catalysts were prepared by electrodeposition of platinum from
a 1% aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 acidified with
HCl onto the surface of the modified samples SMF1 and SMF2. Deposition
of platinum was carried out at the cathode current density i = −2.7 to −80 mA/cm2 for 10–300
s using a two-electrode scheme.

The choice of the conditions
of deposition was based on the Faraday
law. The average weight of the SMF sheet was 0.6 g. In order to support
0.001% or 1 wt % Pt, the quantity of electricity of about 0.012 or
12 C, respectively, is required. This value was achieved by varying
the current and deposition time, for example, i =
−0.05 mA/cm2, t = 20 s. This current
density corresponds to I = −0.7 mA, Q = 1.4 C, and m(Pt) = 7 × 10–7 g or 1 × 10–4% Pt. This catalyst
was labeled as 1 × 10–4% Pt/SMF2.

Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were carried out
using an LEO EVO-50 XVP Zeiss Techniques EDX analyzer. The element
analysis of the surface was carried out using energy-dispersive microanalysis
with an INCA Energy 350 (Oxford Instruments) detector at 15 κV.

4.2 Procedure of Catalytic Measurements
The
catalysts were tested in the reaction of particle methane oxidation
into synthesis gas at an atmospheric pressure in a plug-flow quartz
reactor (i.d. 5 mm) in the temperature range of 700–1000 °C.
The volume hourly space velocity at the molar ratio O2/CH4 = 0.48 was 8000 h–1 (as calculated per
volume of the cylindrical catalytic block, that is, SMF sheet scrolled
to form a cylindrical block with a volume of 1 cm3 (height
15 mm, diameter 5 mm).

Analysis of the gas mixture at the reactor
outlet was determined by gas chromatography using a 3700 (NPO Granat)
chromatograph in isothermal mode (70 °C) using a thermal conductivity
detector and two packed columns: with molecular sieve 5A (H2, O2, N2, CH4, and CO) and HayeSep-Q
(CO2). Helium served as a carrier gas. The analysis was
performed according to the procedure described elsewhere.1,2
