The
molecular interaction between the oligonucleotides and lipid
membranes is the key to the functions of virus, aptamer, and various
oligonucleotide-based materials. In this study, the conformational
changes of oligonucleotides (dT25) on lamellar cationic
1,2-dimyristoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DMTAP) bilayer were investigated
by polarization-resolved sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy
(SFG-VS) in situ. The SFG-VS spectra within different wavenumber ranges
were analyzed to give conformation details of thymine groups, phosphate
groups, and OD/OH groups and to provide a comprehensive and fundamental
understanding of the oligonucleotide adsorption on a model bilayer.
It is shown that the adsorption of dT25 on DMTAP bilayer
reaches maximum at CdT ≈ 500 nM.
And the conformation of dT25 molecules change significantly
when surface charge of DMTAP bilayer reaches the point of zero charge
(PZC) at CdT ≈ 100 nM. Combined
spectroscopic evidences also indicate that the formation of electric
double layer at the DMTAP/dT25 surface follows the Gouy–Chapman–Stern
model. The analysis results also show that the symmetric PO2– stretching mode of oligonucleotide molecules
can serve as a sensitive vibration molecular probe for quantifying
the oligonucleotide/lipid charge ratio and determine the point of
zero charge (PZC) of lipid bilayer surface, which may help researchers
to control the layer-by-layer assembly of oligonucleotide–lipid
complexes and to improve the efficiency genetic therapy against cancer
and viral infections.

1 Introduction
The
complexes formed by cationic lipid membrane and oligonucleotides
have attracted extensive interest because of their applications in
gene delivery as nonviral carriers of genetic material into living
cells.1,2 The molecular interactions (forces) which
assemble the oligonucleotides and lipid bilayers into complex but
ordered lipoplexes are also the key to the functions of virus, aptamer,
and various oligonucleotide-based materials.2−6 The understanding of molecular interactions between
lipid membrane
and oligonucleotides will help researchers perform “bottom
up” assemblies and build lipoplexes with equilibrium structures,
which can ensure the safety and effectiveness of oligonucleotide-based
materials during the gene therapy against the cancer and viral infections.

A number of experimental and theoretical studies have been conducted
to comprehend the mechanism of formation of lipid bilayer–oligonucleotide
complexes.1,7−9 Small-angle X-ray scattering
(SAXS),1,9 stopped-flow spectrofluorometry,10−12 dynamic laser scattering (DLS),13,14 fluorescence
resonance energy transfer,15−17 surface plasmon resonance,18,19 atomic force microscopy,20 cryotransmission
electron microscopy,21,22 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,
and Raman vibrational spectroscopy23−25 were applied to investigate
the lipoplex structures and kinetics of lipoplex formation. Theoretical
modeling and simulation were also applied to understand the molecular
driving force during the DNA adsorption.26,27 In general, the oligonucleotide–lipid bilayer complex formation
can be described in three steps: the accumulation of anionic oligonucleotides
on the cationic bilayer, the reverse/rupture of lipid vesicles, and
the formation of aggregated multilamellar structure. It has been well
established that the formation of lipoplex is driven by electrostatic
attraction between the oppositely charged nucleic acid and lipids.
Results of DLS and SAXS experiments also show that the size and ζ
potential of liposomes can be tuned by lipid composition and the cationic
lipid/DNA charge ratio, which may improve the transfection efficiency
of the lipoplexes.28−31 Nevertheless, due to the limitations of characterizing methods,
the interface/surface specific information at the molecular level
during the lipid–oligonucleotide interaction and lipoplex formation
was hard to be obtained. The insights of accumulation/adsorption of
oligonucleotide at molecular level are required to control the successive
events of charge reversing, vesicle rupturing, and multilamellar lipoplex
formation.

Sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy
(SFG-VS) has
been successfully applied as an interface-specific probe to investigate
the molecular structure and kinetics at biointerfaces.32−39 Recent progresses prove that SFG-VS is also very useful for abstracting
the structural and conformational information from the interfacial
anchored oligonucleotides.40−47 The structure of single-stranded DNA monolayers on platinum substrate
was investigated by Sartenaer et al. using SFG-VS.40 The divalent metal ion-induced deformation of DNA monolayer
was also investigated by Asanuma et al. using SFG-VS and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy.41 Ion–oligonucleotide
interactions were also investigated extensively by Geiger’s
group using multiple nonlinear optical techniques, such as SFG-VS
and second harmonic generation.42,43 The structural differences
between oligonucleotide films in air and under various aqueous situations
were also characterized by Howell et al.44,45 SFG-VS was also applied to investigate the interactions between
oligonucleotides and model lipid membranes. A pioneer work, which
investigated the interaction between the cationic lipid monolayer
and λ-phage DNA molecules by monitoring the OD signals within
the wavenumber range of 2000–2700 cm–1, was
carried out by Wurpel et al.46 By focusing
on the SFG spectra in the wavenumber range of 1200–1800 cm–1, the interfacial conformation and G-quadruplex forming
kinetics of G-rich oligonucleotides on 1,2-dimyristoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane
(DMTAP) lipid bilayers were also elucidated by Wei et al.47 In spite of these previous investigations, the
conformational and kinetic properties of oligonucleotides during the
adsorption/interaction remain elusive. For instance, Wurpel et al.’s
results indicate significant reconstruction of surface water molecules
during the DNA–lipid interaction, which can account for the
Langmuir adsorption of DNA molecules.46 However, the conformation changes of oligonucleotide molecules during
such adsorption are still unclear.

In the current study, the
spectra of dT25–DMTAP
bilayer complexes were collected by the polarization-resolved SFG-VS
system in situ. The SFG spectra detected within different wavenumber
regions can provide conformational details of different molecular
groups, such as phosphate, thymine, and deoxyribose groups, thus facilitating
the elucidation of the molecular mechanism of dT25 molecule–membrane
interaction.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 SFG Spectra in H2O and D2O and Peak Assignments
Figure 1 shows the
ppp and ssp spectra in the wavenumber
range of 1550–1800 cm–1 at various concentration
of dT25 after the dT25–DMTAP bilayer
interaction. Several characteristic peaks at ∼1600 cm–1 (NH2 bending mode of tris buffer), ∼1650 cm–1 (thymine C4=O and C5=C6 out-of-phase 180° stretching mode), ∼1660
cm–1 (thymine C4=O and C5=C6 in-phase 0° stretching mode), and ∼1730
cm–1 (thymine C2=O stretching
mode) can be observed in Figure 1A–C (see Table 1 for details).48,49 As shown in Figure 3A–C, the peak
intensities of C4=O and C5=C6 in-phase 0° stretching mode increase gradually as CdT increases to 250 nM due to the adsorption
of dT25 molecules on DMTAP bilayers. The peak position
of NH2 bending mode is significantly red-shifted to 1592
cm–1 at CdT = 100 nM
(fitting parameters are listed in Table 2), which indicates that the hydrogen-bonding
strength is significantly weakened.53 On
the other hand, the peak width of C4=O and C5=C6 in-phase 0° stretching mode is
significantly narrowed (from 22 to 12 cm–1) at CdT = 100 nM, which indicates that thymine group
of dT25 molecules forms a more compacted conformation at
such concentration.

As to
the dT25 molecules in D2O solution,
the intensities of SFG spectra shown in Figure 1D,F are only 1/10 of those shown in Figure 1A,C. The peak intensities
of thymine C2=O stretching mode may decrease significantly
due to the weaker hydrogen-bonding strength in D2O solution.49 The peak intensity of tris buffer NH2 bending mode and thymine C2=O stretching mode
are not clearly shown in Figure 1D–F. The frequency of NH2 bending
is usually red-shifted (out of this wavenumber range) because the
NH2 group was replaced by the ND2 group in D2O solution.50 The peak widths (9–18
cm–1) of C4=O and C5=C6 in-phase 0° stretching mode shown in Figure 3D–F are much
lower than the peak widths (19–27 cm–1) shown
in Figure 3A–C
(fitting parameters are listed in Table 3). Such spectra characteristics indicate
that thymine groups of dT25 oligonucleotide chain in D2O solution may adopt a more compacted conformation comparing
to the thymine groups in H2O solution. Such difference
in DNA conformations may be induced by the weaker hydrogen-bonding
strength in D2O solution comparing to that in H2O solution due to the isotope effect. It has been reported that hydrogen-bonding
environment is very essential for maintaining the oligonucleotide
conformations: the stronger hydrogen-bonding environment will enhance
the ordering of the nucleotide groups, and the weakening of hydrogen-bonding
environment will lead to a collapsed conformation of oligonucleotides.50,51 Previous electron microscopy experiments also indicate that the
thermal denaturation temperature of DNA molecules in H2O solution is slightly lower than that in D2O solution.52

Figure 2 shows the Ippp and Issp spectra
in the wavenumber range of 1000–1200 cm–1 at various concentrations of dT25 after dT25–DMTAP bilayers interaction. As seen in Figure 2, several characteristic peaks at ∼1060
cm–1 (deoxyribose C–C stretching), ∼1090
cm–1 (symmetric PO2– stretching), and ∼1150 cm–1 (deoxyribose
C–O–C stretching) are shown in Figure 2A–F.53

The peak position of symmetric PO2– stretching mode in H2O solution is
significantly red-shifted
at CdT = 50 nM, and the peak position
of symmetric PO2– stretching mode in
D2O solution is significantly red-shifted at CdT = 100 nM. The peak width of symmetric PO2– stretching mode in H2O solution is
slightly smaller than that in D2O solution. However, the
changes of the peak amplitudes of deoxyribose C–C stretching
and deoxyribose C–O–C stretching seem unpatented (shown
in Figures S2 and S4).

Figure 3 shows the susceptibilities (|χ(2)| = |Aq/Γq|) and center
wavenumbers (ω0,q) fitted from the SFG spectra in
different wavenumber ranges (Figures S1–S4). As shown in Figure 3A,B, the susceptibilities (χppp(2) and χssp(2)) of thymine groups increase as CdT increases and reach a maximum value at CdT = 600 nM in H2O solution and CdT = 500 nM in D2O solution. As to
the PO2– groups (Figure 3D,E), the curves of susceptibilities in H2O solution and D2O solution show a significant
increase at CdT ≈ 100 nM, which
indicates that ordering or surface abundance of PO2– groups is improved at such concentration. However,
the values of χppp,PO2–(2) and χssp,PO2–(2) are showing ongoing increases at CdT = 600 and 500 nM. On the other hand, it is also easy to
note that the peaks of thymine C4=O and C5=C6 in-phase 0° stretching mode and symmetric
PO2– stretching mode at CdT ≈ 100 nM (Figure 3C,F) in both D2O solution and H2O solution are significantly red-shifted comparing to those observed
at other concentrations. The fitted parameters indicate that the peak
position of thymine C4=O and C5=C6 in-phase 0° stretching (ω0Thymine) is red-shifted ∼4
cm–1 in H2O and ∼7 cm–1 in D2O at CdT = 100 nM. And
the peak position of symmetric PO2– stretching
(ω0PO2–)
is red-shifted ∼3 cm–1 in H2O
and ∼6 cm–1 in D2O at CdT = 75 nM. Such red shifts of both peaks indicate
that local environments around the PO2– groups and thymine groups at CdT ≈
100 nM are very different from the local environments at other concentrations.53

2.2 Adsorption Model for dT25 Molecules
To understand the influence of local environment changes at different CdT values and to clarify the IR assignment,
the SFG spectra of both OH stretching modes and OD stretching modes
were collected (shown in Figure 4). The concentration dependence of effective polarizabilities
of OD stretching (|POD(2)| = |Assp,OD/Γ|) is shown in Figure 6. The peaks at ∼3200, ∼3400, and ∼3650
cm–1, originated from the OH stretching modes of
surface H2O molecules,54,55 are shown
in the wavenumber range of 3000–3800 cm–1 (Figure 4A). The
peaks at ∼2350, ∼2550, and ∼2720 cm–1, originated from the OD stretching modes of surface D2O molecules,56−58 are shown in the wavenumber range of 2200–2800
cm–1 (Figure 4B). SFG-VS intensities of OH stretching modes and OD stretching
modes can be used as indicators of surface charge density and hydrogen-bonding
strength (function S1 in the Supporting
Information). The spectra intensities of OH stretching modes show
a drop-then-rise trend with a minimum value at CdT = 100 nM, and the spectra intensities of OD stretching modes
show a minimum value at CdT = 75 nM (Figure 5B). As shown in Figure 5A, the peak width
of OD stretching mode is slightly increased at CdT = 75 nM. The SFG-VS signals generated from the charged surface
have contributions from both the second-order nonlinear susceptibilities
χeff(2) (interface contribution) and third-order nonlinear susceptibilities
χeff(3) (bulk contribution).59,60 It should be noted that the surface
charge can increase not only the molecular ordering of H2O/D2O molecules, which will increase the interface contribution,
but also the surface potential, which will increase the bulk contribution.
And the signs of both terms in function S1 are determined by the sign of surface charge (σSum = σ0,DMTAP + σdT25).
Thus, despite the difficulties in quantifying the contribution form
the interface and the bulk, combined spectroscopic evidences in OD
spectra and OH spectra indicate that DMTAP bilayer surface reaches
a point of zero charge (PZC) at CdT ≈
100 nM.61−63

of OD stretching (|POD(2)| = |Assp,OD/Γ|).

It is also interesting
to see that the adsorption of dT25 molecules continues
after the surface reaches PZC at CdT ≈
100 nM. A condensed layer of negatively charged
electrolytes can be formed by overcoming repulsive electrostatic forces
during the adsorption of dT25 molecules at high concentration
(CdT > 100 nM), which is the typical
formation
of electric double layer of the Gouy–Chapman–Stern model.64,65 These newest experimental results indicate that even with the oligonucleotides
without conjugated hydrophobic molecular groups, the electrostatic
force between the negatively charged oligonucleotide and the positively
charged DMTAP bilayer is not the only driven force during the oligonucleotide
adsorption. Such conclusion coincides with experimental results of
the alkyl chain conjugated oligonucleotides in previous literature
works.47

2.3 Conformation
of dT25 Molecules
Orientation analyses were also
performed based on the Raman polarizabilities
reported in the literature.66,67Figure 6A,B shows the calculated tilt angle of in-phase C4=O and C5=C6 stretching mode
at ∼1660 cm–1 and symmetric PO2– at ∼1090 cm–1 at various
concentrations. As seen in Figure 6A, the tilt angle of thymine groups in D2O (θD2OThymine) fluctuates slightly and stays around 70° when CdT increases from 25 to 500 nM. The final average
tilt angle of thymine groups is 70.9 ± 7.6° at CdT = 100 nM. Such trend of θD2OThymine indicates
that the tilt angle of thymine groups are insensitive to the changes
of surface charge density and surface electrostatic force field. The
tilt angle of the symmetric PO2– stretching
mode in D2O solution (θD2OPO2–) decreases significantly
at CdT = 50 and 100 nM. The decrease of
tilt angle and the significant increase of χppp(2) and χssp(2) (shown in Figure 3E) indicate that the molecular
ordering of PO2– groups is greatly improved
at CdT ≈ 100 nM.

Figure 6 Concentration dependence
of calculated tilt angle of (A) in-phase
C4=O and C5=C6 stretching
mode at ∼1660 cm–1 (θD2OThymine) and (B) symmetric
PO2– stretching at ∼1090 cm–1 (θD2OPO2–) in D2O solution.

Both red shifts of symmetric PO2– stretching
mode and enhanced ordering of PO2– groups
indicate that the binding affinity between DMTAP and dT25 molecules is greatly improved at PZC. Such improved binding affinity
may be induced by the significant decrease of electrolyte concentration
and ion screening effects around the PO2– groups (in dT25 molecules) and NH3+ groups (in DMTAP molecules) at PZC.68,69 As estimated
by Levinson et
al.,53 the PO2– symmetric stretching frequency can be tuned by the interaction strength
(of various chemical environments) along the C2 axis with a rate of 0.40 cm–1 (MV/cm) via
linear Strak effects. The changes of interaction strength ΔF during the dT25–DMTAP bilayer interaction
in H2O and D2O are estimated to be 7.5 ±
1.9 and 15.1 ± 2.4 MV/cm, respectively, . Thus, the lowest point of ω0PO2– curve can be a mark
of PZC point of the DMTAP bilayer surface due to the strongest intermolecular
interaction at PZC, where the oligonucleotide/lipid charge ratio =
1:1. And the PO2– groups of oligonucleotide
molecule can act as a sensitive vibration molecular probe68,69 for quantifying the oligonucleotide/lipid charge ratio and determining
the point of zero charge (PZC) of lipid bilayer surface.

3 Summary
In this study, adsorption structure and conformation
of oligonucleotide
(dT25) molecules were investigated by SFG-VS in situ. The
SFG-VS spectra within different wavenumber ranges were analyzed to
provide conformation details of thymine groups, phosphate groups,
and OD/OH groups and to provide a comprehensive and fundamental understanding
of the oligonucleotide adsorption on a model bilayer. Combined spectroscopic
evidences also indicate that the formation of an electric double layer
on the DMTAP/dT25 surface follows the Gouy–Chapman–Stern
model. And the conformation of dT25 molecules changed significantly
when the DMTAP bilayer reaches a point of zero charge (PZC) at CdT ≈ 100 nM. On the basis of the orientation
analysis, the final average tilt angle of thymine groups is 70.9 ±
7.6°. These results demonstrated that the vibrational spectra
collected by in situ label-free polarization-resolved SFG-VS detections
can provide new molecular insights into the mechanisms of oligonucleotide–membrane
interaction.

Our analysis results also show that the symmetric
PO2– stretching mode of oligonucleotide
molecules
can serve as a sensitive vibration molecular probe to quantify the
oligonucleotide/lipid charge ratio and determine the point of zero
charge (PZC) of lipid bilayer surface, which may help the researcher
to control the layer-by-layer assembly of oligonucleotide–lipid
complexes and improve the efficiency of genetic therapy against cancer
and viral infections.70,71

Cationic lipid 1,2-dimyristoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane
(DMTAP,
purity > 99%, purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.) was used
to
build solid-supported lamellar lipid bilayers. The DMTAP monolayers
were deposited on CaF2 prisms at a surface pressure of
33 mN/m (∼50 Å2/mol) via the Langmuir–Blodgett
method. The CaF2 prisms with DMTAP monolayer were slowly
dehydrated overnight to remove the residue water and improve the bilayer
stability. The second DMTAP monolayer was also deposited on CaF2 prisms at a similar surface pressure (30–33 mN/m)
via the Langmuir–Schaefer method to form prism-supported lamellar
DMTAP bilayers. The detailed preparation processes can be found in
previous papers.72−74 The lamellar DMTAP bilayers prepared via the Langmuir–Blodgett
and Langmuir–Schaefer methods are highly controllable and repeatable,
which can be hardly achieved by the liposomes prepared in solutions.
Such bilayer can be used as an ideal model system to investigate the
oligonucleotide–membrane interaction.

After the preparation,
the lipid bilayers were immersed in a small
reservoir with a volume of 2.5 mL. The dT25 oligonucleotide
molecules (purity > 98% by HPLC, Takara Bio, Inc., Dalian) were
dissolved
in 10 mM tris buffer solution (pH ≈ 7.4) with a concentration
of 10 nmol/mL (μM). The dT25–tris solution
was added to the reservoir with a microsyringe to interact with the
DMTAP bilayers.

All of the SFG-VS measurements were performed
on a picosecond sum
frequency generation system purchased from EKSPLA, Lithuania. The
optical arrangements and programs were custom-modified to perform
polarization-resolved detections (see Scheme 1 for details).75,76 Briefly, the
polarization angle of visible beam (Ωvis) was switched
between 0 and 90° by a rotational motorized half-wave plate (HWP-M)
at each wavenumber point during the IR scanning SFG spectra collection.
The SFG signals (the ssp and psp signals at Ωvis =
0°, the ppp and spp signals at Ωvis = 90°,
where the first letter s/p stands for the polarization state of SFG
signal, the second letter stands for the polarization state of visible
light, and the third letter stands for the polarization state of IR
light) were separated by a polarization splitter (PS). The separated
SFG signals passed through Glan polarizers (GP1, GP2), half-wave plates
(HWP1, HWP2), notch filters (F1, F2), and focusing lenses (L1, L2)
separately and then entered two sets of identical detection systems
(Monochromator 3501/3504, SOLAR TII and PMT R7899, Hamamatsu). The
SFG-VS spectra within the wavenumber ranges of 1000–1200, 1550–1800,
and 3000–3800 cm–1 (2200–2800 cm–1 for D2O solutions) were collected after
the sample reached equilibrium. The incident angles of visible beam
and IR beam are 63° and 52°, respectively. Over 150 pulses
were averaged for each wavelength point in the SFG-VS spectra. All
of the SFG intensities shown in the figures below were normalized
by the energy of visible beam Ivis and
IR beam IIR. Half of the path of IR beam
was purged by N2 gas to decrease the absorbing effects
of atmospheric H2O and CO2 molecules. The spectra
within the wavenumber range of 2200–2800 cm–1 were also normalized to the SFG spectra of z-cut quartz to remove
the IR absorbance of atmospheric CO2.
