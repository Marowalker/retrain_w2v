A lightweight super hydrophilic hybrid
sponge is designed and demonstrated
out of water glass and an organic polymer, which has a macroporous
flaky nature and is superflexible with an apparent density of 0.069
g cc–1, ∼97% porosity, and 3000% water uptake.
The octadecyltrimethoxy silane-modified hybrid sponge exhibits selective
absorption of oil and organic solvents in open water. An absorption
capacity in the range 12–23 g g–1 for the
test liquids light crude oil, engine oil, paraffin oil, chloroform,
kerosene, and hexane is revealed. Absorption capacity by a weight
basis was directly proportional to the density and inversely proportional
to the viscosity of test liquids. Trials under both stagnant and turbulent
conditions verify selective uptake of oil from sea water. Complete
regeneration of the absorbent was possible for ten cycles for the
test liquids. The work provides design of an affordable water clean-up
material alternative to commonly used polyurethane sponges.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Oil
and its derivatives, during drilling, transportation, and storage,
pose subsequent risk of spillage, which is an environmental catastrophe.
The depth at which the oil spills, either deep water or surface spillage,
prevents the evaporation of many volatile organic components, triggering
the rise in concentration beyond the solubility in sea water.1,2 This calls for the deployment of oil removal techniques either solely
or in combination for an effective response.3 Taking out a considerable amount of oil at a relatively faster rate
will be the suitable remediation. The use of universal absorbents
is not suitable for application-specific studies that require superhydrophobic
and superoleophilic properties. Chemical dispersants,4,5 mechanical containments,6 oil absorbents,2,9,10 and in situ burning11 are seemingly the best followed strategies at
present. Sugar-based gelators have freshly been stated to absorb crude
oil effectively.12,13 Recently, membranes have been
used for the separation of water from oil in water emulsions.14−16 The effectiveness of the employed methods hinges on several parameters
like the viscosity of the oils, weather conditions, temperature, time
passed, and so on. Skimmers and oil absorbents are actually in the
limelight as they could remove oil without leaving any residue. As
the spilled oil layer becomes thinner, a decrease in the efficiency
of skimmers is noticed.6 When natural fibers
are used, being hygroscopic, a compromise in the selectivity of the
absorbent is evident.17,18

Materials that are highly
compressible, soft, and porous with excellent
capacity for the absorption of solvents are generally labeled sponges.19 Spongy materials serve in different fields of
science and engineering as filter aids, adsorbent/absorbent materials,
drug delivery vehicles, impervious surface cleaning materials, and
so on. The leading application is in the field of oil absorption.20,1,2 A sponge substrate offers good
oleophilicity, elasticity, and high porosity and is made out of water-soluble
polymers.21 Poly(vinyl alcohol) is contemplated
as the most attractive polymer for making three-dimensional matrices
as it possesses excellent properties like biocompatibility, mechanical
strength, flexibility, biodegradability, cheapness, lower toxicity,
and a good degree of hydrophilicity.22 The
PVA formaldehyde sponges with a macroporous structure have been successfully
used for oil absorption studies in the past.20,23 PVA reacts with formaldehyde in pairs and hence leaves lots of isolated
surface −OH groups, which are available for surface modification.23 Proper surface engineering aids the use of these
sponges in oil absorption studies. This situation gives scope for
the design and development of a wide variety of synthetic materials.
An ideal oil absorbent should be superhydrophobic and superoleophilic,
should possess high selectivity in oil–water separation, and
also could be regenerated.7 By selective
pruning of the flaws in the mentioned materials, better performance
is obtained for different engineered sorbents.

Recently, much
emphasis is given to the study of porous silica
worldwide. Inorganic silica materials and polymeric macroscopic networks
as such possess lower oil absorption capacities (<2 g g–1) due to their abundant surface −OH groups.23,24 They as such absorb water that is several times their preliminary
mass. Absorbents with hydrophobic surface coverage based on different
raw materials like aerogels,25−28 foams,9,29−37 sponges,7,8,10,22,23,38−41 carbon nanotubes,29 and so on have been
noticeably excellent due to their superhydrophobic and superoleophilic
properties, faster kinetics, recovery, and reusability. Studies reveal
that the surface functionalization of commercially available sponges
with their three-dimensional macroscopic nature and open-cell structure
may well produce high-performance oleophilic absorbents that are easy
to handle. The common functionalities include stearoyl chloride,20,23 styrene(divinyl benzene),32 silanes like
polydimethoxysilane (PDMS),38,41 octadecylsilane (OTS),39,42 methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS),43 aminopropyltrimethoxysilane
(APTMS), 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane (HFOTES),24 and still more. Silanes, which are a homologous
series of inorganic compounds depending on their surface functional
groups, could offer a varied range of hydrophobicities on functionalization.

In this work, we have designed an innovative lightweight, superswelling
water glass sponge absorbent out of inorganic sodium silicate in which
the macroporous structural stability is provided by organic poly(vinyl
alcohol) through simple cross-linking and polymerization. Water glass
is a very cheap and available material and is rarely explored for
absorption applications. The hybrid material clubbing the property
of both inorganic porous silica and organic polymers could be superior
to the conventional absorbents. The hybrid material is effectively
surface-modified with silanes to deliver hydrophobic sponges for the
absorption of lower-, medium-, and high-density/viscosity oils. The
absorbent is tested under stringent conditions for evaluating the
absorption, regeneration, and reusable competencies.

2 Results and Discussion
Water glass-based hybrid sponges
were successfully synthesized
as per the procedure outlined. PVA is an extremely lathering organic
polymer, and it along with the surfactant PEG is able to form a white
creamy foam base that is prepared to incorporate the inorganic silica.
The organic part delivered the necessary strength for the otherwise
crumbled material that could be produced from sodium silicate alone. Figure 1 exhibits the synthesis
scheme for the preparation of an IOHS, and the material was seen to
be floating in nature with numerous dangling surface hydroxyl groups.

Figure 1 Synthesis
scheme for inorganic–organic hybrid sponges (IOHS).

Figure 2 displays
the physical properties of the IOHS. The fashioned absorbent material
was superflexible with a spongy nature and was superhydrophilic. The
superflexible and spongy nature is due to the flexible film-forming
property of PVA.20,22 The inorganic counterpart added
superhydrophilicity to the absorbent with the plentiful hydroxyl groups
from sodium silicate. Since silica sol is capable of undergoing gelation
in the presence of acid at appropriate pH via hydrolysis and condensation,44,45 the siloxane bonds formed via addition of silica sol to the already
lathered solution hemmed in an interconnected network with the hydroxyl
groups of partly cross-linked PVA, resulting in fine-looking hybrid
sponges with multifunctional properties. The synthesized sponges hereafter
entitled inorganic–organic hybrid sponges (IOHSs) have an apparent
density of 0.069 g cc–1 with ∼97% porosity.
The thermal conductivity of the sample is recorded to be 0.041 W/
m K, which is very low, conveying that the heat transfer through the
material is poor, which is supported by its macroporous nature. In
materials like aerogels, sponges, foams, and so on, the molecules
are not tightly packed, and hence heat cannot find a way to propagate
through the void-filled networks.46 The
water absorption capacity of the material is tested over 20 cycles
to study the superhydrophilic property exhibited, and the absorbent
was capable of absorbing water approximately 30 times its own weight
even after repeated squeezing. A video showing the superswelling nature
of the sponge is provided in Movie S1 of
the Supporting Information. The photographic images of the hybrid
sponge support its lightweight nature due to its lower density.

of IOHS, showing the water uptake graph over
20 cycles of study, density, porosity, thermal conductivity, superflexible
nature, and the digital photographic images of hybrid sponges.

To make use of the material for solvent and oil
absorption, the
surface has to be tailored to meet the definite requirements of a
superhydrophobic and superoleophilic nature. Different silanes are
capable of forming surface siloxane bonds with the hydroxyl groups,
and hence the larger the number of surface hydroxyl groups, the more
the moieties that will be available for functionalization. The hydrophobic
and oleophilic nature of silanes depends upon their linker or alkyl
chain length and the terminal −R groups. The degree of hydrophobicity
can be understood from the water contact angle measurements of the
sponge samples.

2.1 Water Contact Angle (WCA) Measurements
The WCA measurements of the samples are pictured in Figure 3. For the PVA–formaldehyde
sponge, the contact angle was 73 ± 1° owing to its hydrophilic
nature. The unmodified IOHS was superhydrophilic with a contact angle
of <1°, which is imparted by the additional surface −OH
groups from sodium silicate. When the surface is functionalized with
silanes, the contact angle improved, showing a hydrophobic nature.
This enhancement in the hydrophobic and oleophilic nature is established
by the presence of abundant surface −OH groups from both PVA
and sodium silicate that were available for the alkyl chains of silane
to react, thereby imparting the water repellence property. The measured
contact angle values were 108 ± 1, 115 ± 0.8, and 124 ±
1° for IOHSV, IOHSE, and IOHSO samples, respectively. Since OTMS
has a long alkyl chain or linker length, the number of surface hydrophobic
groups will be more and hence better hydrophobicity for the IOHSO
sponge. IOHSE falls second due to its numerous surface methyl groups
followed by the IOHSV absorbent. The adhesive force between the water
droplet and the sample surface decreases in the order 144 < 93.05
< 49.75 < 41.57 < 31.74 mJ m–2 for the
IOHS, PVA sponge, IOHSV, IOHSE, and IOHSO, respectively. This shows
that with an increase in hydrophobicity, the water molecules find
it difficult to get attached to the substrate surface.

(d) IOHSE, and (e) IOHSO.

2.2 Surface Morphology Analysis
The SEM
micrographs of the samples are presented in Figure 4. The PVA sponge (Figure 4a,b) has a three-dimensional highly networked
macroporous arrangement. For the IOHS, the whole morphology is transformed
into a flaky porous structure as is visible in Figure 4c,d, showing the reaction of the polymer
with sodium silicate. Figure 4e–g shows the structures for hydrophobic IOHSO, IOHSE,
and IOHSV sponges, respectively. For IOHSO, the morphology is with
numerous struts and convolutions, which is due to the hanging of long
organic chain groups from the surface. Due to the shorter alkyl chain
length, IOHSE and IOHSV show a more sheet-like surface. The more convoluted
surface of IOHSO may be the reason for its higher contact angle.

microscopy images of (a, b) PVA sponge, (c, d) IOHS, (e)
IOHSO, (f) IOHSE, and (g) IOHSV.

The elemental mapping and EDAX spectrum of the samples are revealed
in Figure 5. The EDAX
spectra reveals the presence of the elements carbon (red), oxygen
(green), silicon (yellow), and sodium (white). From the elemental
mapping, we can comprehend an increase in the organic content of the
sample, and it is reflected in the concentration of carbon in the
images. Also, the addition of silanes led to an increased density
of elemental Si in the maps.

of the hydrophilic
and hydrophobic sponges IOHS, IOHSV, IOHSE, and IOHSO.

2.3 FTIR Analysis
The ATR-IR spectra
of the samples studied are represented in Figure 6. For the pure PVA sponge, in the region
1000 to 1400 cm–1, five bands were observed at 1380,
1330, 1240, 1135, and 1085 cm–1, which are probably
associated with the motions of the substituent groups CH2, C–O–C, and so on in the material, the last band arising
from the stretching of the C–O bond. The assignments of the
bands at around 3400, 2925 and 2827, and 1466 cm–1 is for the O–H stretching, C–H stretching, and C–H
bending vibrations, respectively.50,51 The peak at
785 cm–1 is from the C–C bond.52 The peak at 1646 cm–1 is related
to the −OH bending vibration of physically absorbed water.53 The characteristic peaks for silica were detected
at 443, 802, and 1100 cm–1 equivalent to O–Si–O,
Si–OH, and Si–O–Si bonds, which implies the condensation
of silicon alkoxide.39,42,53 The high-intensity silica peaks for IOHSO confirm that the silane
content is high in this sample compared to those in others. Also,
intense peaks were observed for C–H stretching vibrations,
which are attributed to the long alkyl chains.

PVA sponge, super hydrophilic IOHS, and
hydrophobic IOHSO, IOHSE, and IOHSV.

2.4 Wide-Angle XRD (WAXD) Analysis
Figure 7 shows the wide-angle
XRD pattern of the samples studied. For the pure PVA sponge, the fundamental
peak of PVA is observed at 2θ = 19.6°.54 The broad peak detected at 2θ = 23° for the
IOHS is from amorphous silica.40 The silane-modified
samples reflect a broad peak between 15 and 25°, which is attributed
to the overlapping of peaks from both PVA and silica. The PVA peak
decreases when silica is introduced in the material, which is indicative
of the cross-linking reaction between PVA and sodium silicate. The
high-intensity peak observed for IOHSO signifies that the silica content
is larger in the IOHSO sample followed by IOHSE and IOHSV in that
order.

sponges IOHSO, IOHSE, and IOHSV.

2.5 Thermogravimetric Analysis
The TG
analysis of the samples studied is represented in Figure 8. The pure PVA sponge shows
complete decomposition due to its pure organic nature. At 150 °C,
all the samples show weight loss due to dehydration. The second-stage
weight loss for the IOHS is from the decomposition of organic groups
from PVA, and the weight loss for IOHSE and IOHSV is due to loss of
organics from PVA and the respective silane used for surface modification.
IOHSO exhibits a three-stage weight loss. The initial one is due to
loss of moisture, the second weight loss is attributed to the ligand
organic moiety decomposition, and the final weight loss is due to
the loss of alkyl chains,49 which is supported
by the two sharp exothermic peaks at around 250 and 300 °C in
the DTA curve. Depending upon the length of the alkyl chain of the
silanes modified, the weight loss percentage also increases, attributable
to the increase in the number of organic moieties present. After a
temperature of 350 °C, the weight loss is high due to the oxidation
of Si–R groups to Si–OH.46 This is also confirmed by the DTA peak of the samples. The weight
loss percentage increases in the order 51.2, 72.1, and 79.8 for IOHSE,
IOHSV, and IOHSO, respectively, which is in proportion to the organic
content present in the samples.

IOHS, and hydrophobic sponges IOHSO, IOHSE, and IOHSV.

2.6 Analysis for Performance Properties
2.6.1 Dynamic Degradation Studies
The
dynamic degradation studies are directed to determine the buoyancy
and hydrophobic and oleophilic properties of the sample. If greater
than 10% of the sorbent is observed to sink in the water column or
if the column is contaminated with loose sorbent particles, then the
absorbent is considered to be a failure and not recommended for use
in open waterways.

From the buoyancy studies shown in Figure 9a, it is noticed
that after shaking for 15 min, the water column is not tainted by
any loose absorbent particles, indicative of the fact that the absorbents
are fit for use in open waterways.

Figure 9 (a) Buoyancy studies conducted for hydrophobic
sponge samples in
distilled water; (b) water absorbency ratio by weight for the hydrophobic
sponges.

The water absorbency ratio of
the sample is calculated from the
succeeding equation47 1  where SO is the initial dry absorbent weight and SW is
the net water absorbed, which is calculated as SWT – SO where SWT is the weight of absorbent samples at the end of the
water test.

Figure 9b shows
the plot for the water absorbency ratio by weight. The high uptake
ratio for IOHSV is the indication that the material has free surface
−OH groups even after the silane treatment. After 15 min, the
percentages of water absorbed for the samples IOHSO, IOHSE, and IOHSV
are 9.75, 15.06, and 17.53%, respectively, which points to the fact
that the sample IOHSO passes the buoyancy test whereas IOHSE and IOHSV
are reflected as a failure since >10% water uptake is recorded.

The oleophilic nature of the samples is clearly evident from Figure 10. There is no existence
of an oil sheen on the water surface after study, pertaining to the
oleophilic nature of the absorbent after the absorption time period.

Figure 10 Oleophilic
studies conducted for hydrophobic sponge samples.

From the dynamic degradation studies, it is marked that the sample
IOHSO possesses all the properties of buoyancy, hydrophobicity, and
oleophilicty whereas the samples IOHSE and IOHSV are oleophilic but,
in unison, the water absorbency is relatively more, which makes them
unfit for use in open water bodies.

2.6.2 Oil
Absorption Studies
The oil
absorption studies are conducted for all the three hydrophobic sponges
IOHSV, IOHSE, and IOHSO. Oil absorbency is defined as the ratio of
oil absorbed to the dry absorbent weight as calculated from the equation47 below 2  where SO is the initial dry absorbent weight and SS is the net oil absorbed, which is calculated as SST – SO where SST is the weight of absorbent samples at the
end of the oil test.

The results for the oil absorption studies
conducted for a period of 15 min for different hydrophobic samples
are shown in Figure 11.

Figure 11 Oil absorption studies for hydrophobic samples (a) IOHSV, (b) IOHSE,
and (c) IOHSO.

For IOHSV, the absorption capacity
is very low for all the test
liquids. TMES and OTMS silane-functionalized samples exhibited better
absorption capacities for the six test liquids. IOHSO displayed comparatively
higher absorption potential, which is due to the long-order alkyl
chains of the silane. The improved absorption capacity can be explained
based on the alkyl chain length and number of surface hydrolyzable
groups present in the silanes.

The broad representation of silanes
and the structure of silanes
used for surface functionalization are presented in Figure 12. In general, silanes contain
an organo functional group, a linker, and a silicon atom with hydrolyzable
groups. The linker connects between the functional groups and the
silicon atom. The silicon atom is linked to surface hydrolyzable groups
reliant upon the silanes chosen. Here, VTMS comprises a C2 chain with
three hydrolyzable methoxy groups. TMES meanwhile has a C2 chain with
one hydrolyzable ethoxy group. The longest linker length is for OTMS,
a C18 chain with three hydrolyzable methoxy groups.

Figure 12 (a) General representation
of silanes; (b) structure of silanes
used for surface functionalization, namely, VTMS, TMES, and OTMS.

The general reaction for surface modification of
silica by silylating
agents46 is as follows: 3  Here, the −OH groups
on the silica surface react with the silylating agent to form siloxane
bonds with terminal −R groups and ROH as a byproduct.

The three hydrolyzable methoxy groups of VTMS react with three
−OH groups of silica to form siloxane bonds with the end chain
—CH=CH2 and methanol as a byproduct (Figure 13a). The extent
of reaction rests on the large availability of surface hydroxyl groups
from sodium silicate and unreacted −OH groups from PVA. The
reaction of OTMS with silica is conversely similar, with the end chain
being very long, that is, −CH2–(CH2)16–CH3. Here also, the byproduct is
methanol (Figure 13b). In both these cases, one mole of silane can react with three
hydroxyl groups. In the case of TMES, one mole of silane is capable
of reacting with only one hydroxyl group. Thus, more silane is required
for proper surface coverage in TMES as compared to OTMS and VTMS.
However, the surface is crowded with more methyl groups that may help
in improving the hydrophobicity of the functionalized absorbent material.
Also, the byproduct is ethanol, which has lower toxicity.

Figure 13 Mechanism
for the reaction of silica with silanes: (a) VTMS, (b)
OTMS, and (c) TMES.

The enhancement in hydrophobicity
can be identified from the contact
angle measurements. With an increase in the alkyl chain length, the
water contact angle will be improved, and also, aligned long alkyl
chains (n ≥ 12) can repel the water from the
surface because of their low surface energies.42 Due to the short alkyl chain length of TMES and VTMS, their
contact angle is lower in comparison with the sample IOHSO, which
is functionalized with OTMS. For IOHSV, an ordered range of surface
coverage was not achieved, which is reflected in the lower contact
angle value of 108 ± 1°. In addition to the linker length,
the presence of −R groups in silane also adds to the hydrophobic
nature of the absorbent. The existence of surface methyl groups imparted
hydrophobicity to IOHSE (Figure 13c). Here, each silane molecule is endowed with three
methyl groups, the end result being an absorbent surface swarming
with −CH3 groups, and hence a higher contact angle
could be expected. Nevertheless, due to the steric hindrance, the
surface coverage was not of a well-organized nature, which may have
led to a lower contact angle of 115 ± 0.8°. For OTMS, owing
to the presence of its C18 chain, a long-range order with well-aligned
surface coverage was possible, and hence an improved contact angle
of 124 ± 1°. The FTIR spectra reflect the existence of a
large number of carbon groups with high-intensity −CH stretching
vibrations. The intensities of silica peaks were also high in IOHSO
followed by IOHSE and IOHSV. This adds to the theory that OTMS silane
was better capable of adhering to the superhydrophilic absorbent surface
than the two other silanes. It is further supported by the diffraction
intensity peaks in WAXD analysis. Here also, the silica content is
larger for IOHSO followed by IOHSE and IOHSV. The absorbent sponges
with high organic content are observed to have higher weight loss
by thermogravimetric analysis. Consequently, among the silane-functionalized
hybrid absorbents, weight loss is more for IOHSO followed by IOHSE
and IOHSV. The results are in agreement with the SEM morphology, which
shows a more sheet-like surface for IOHSV and IOHSE but a highly convoluted
ordered surface morphology for IOHSO.

The lower contact angle
of IOHSV is the reason for its higher water
uptake. High water absorption means a less oleophilic nature, and
the same is reflected in the oil absorption studies with the six chosen
test liquids. Among the three hydrophobic sorbents, IOHSV possessed
the lowest absorption capacities for all the test liquids. IOHSE shows
better oil and solvent uptake compared to IOHSV, which is due to the
existence of abundant surface methyl groups. For both IOHSO and IOHSE,
the oil absorption capacities were more or less the same. However,
due to the slow increase in the water absorption nature of IOHSE,
when it comes to a mixture of water and oil, the selectivity of the
absorbent will be at stake. For OTMS-modified sponges, the water uptake
is much less, and also the absorption capacity recorded was very good
due to their long-range order of alkyl chains and improved contact
angle. In IOHSO, the linker or alkyl chain length determines the hydrophobicity,
whereas in IOHSE, the surface methyl groups play a crucial role in
imparting a hydrophobic nature. The oil absorption studies shows that
as the density of the test liquid increases, an increase in absorption
capacity is observed since higher density means larger mass and hence
an increase in weight. Of all the test liquids, chloroform has a higher
density of 1.49 g cm–3 and it is a low-viscosity
liquid with 0.53 cP. Due to its lower viscosity, it can easily penetrate
through the pores of the absorbent. Also, the higher density of the
liquid is reflected in the absorption capacity values. From the studies,
it is evident that the density and absorption capacity are directly
proportional, whereas the viscosity and absorption capacity maintain
an inverse proportionality relation. Light crude oil from a petroleum
fraction was also selected for the study. The density of the crude
was measured and found to be 0.64 g cc–1 with a
viscosity of 8.04 cP. The absorption capacity for crude oil increases
in the order IOHSE < IOHSO < IOHSV with values 12.11, 15.04,
and 18.55 g g–1, respectively.

For the use
of the hybrid sponge under practical conditions, seawater
from Vizhinjam local beach was collected, and the water absorption
was recorded. Figure 14a shows the hydrophobic sponges before and after absorption, and
the water uptake is plotted in Figure 14b.

Figure 14 (a) Buoyancy studies conducted for hydrophobic
sponge samples in
sea water; (b) sea water absorbency ratio by weight for the hydrophobic
sponges.

Here, the uptake capacity increases
in the order IOHSO < IOHSE
< IOHSV with percentages of water absorption of 8.72, 10.63, and
13.73%, respectively, for a time interval of 15 min. It is observed
that in sea water, the uptake for IOHSE and IOHSV is less compared
than that of ordinary water and also fails to keep up with the ASTM
standards.

Since of all the three hybrid sponges IOHSV, IOHSE,
and IOHSO,
the maximum expectations are met by IOHSO, IOHSO sponge is studied
for its regeneration ability in hexane media, and the results are
presented in Figure 15. It can be emphasized that hexane serves as an excellent solvent
for regeneration of the absorbent material, and in a ten-cycle study
conducted with viscous engine oil, the absorption capacity remained
essentially the same. The absorption capacity of IOHSO for Castrol
4T engine oil with 6600 cP viscosity is 16.38 g g–1.

Figure 15 Cyclic absorption studies for the hydrophobic sponge IOHSO in engine
oil.

Then again, under real environmental
conditions, the water is not
stagnant. Hence, the absorption of engine oil under turbulent conditions
were tested, and the results are presented in Figure 16, which shows the digital photographs illustrating
the progress of absorption of engine oil under stagnant and turbulent
conditions. The sponge was found to be a success under both conditions.

sponge; absorption of engine oil by IOHSO under (b) stagnant and (c)
turbulent conditions.

The repeated absorption
and squeezing of a low-viscosity test liquid
(kerosene) by the IOHSO absorbent sponge is provided in Supporting
Information, Movie S2. A study was also
conducted to identify the absorption of high-density liquids in water.
Chloroform was chosen as the test liquid, which has a density of 1.49
g cc–1, which is higher than that of water (1 g
cc–1). The hybrid absorbent sponge was capable of
effortlessly removing the chloroform completely from water (Figure 17), and a video
illustrating this is provided in Supporting Information, Movie S3.

with Nile red) absorption
under water by the IOHSO absorbent.

For light crude oil, complete regeneration of the absorbent was
not possible due to the presence of other impurities like asphalts,
sulfur, and so on. However, the absorption capacity over repeated
cycles was found to be more or less the same. An additional study
was conducted to understand if the IOHSO absorbent was capable of
selective absorption of crude oil from sea water. As evidenced by Figure 18, the absorbent
sponge could take up crude oil selectively from sea water.

3 Conclusions
Water glass-based hybrid
sponge absorbents with superhydrophilicity
were successfully synthesized, which possessed multifunctional properties
like low density, superflexibility, very low thermal conductivity,
and excellent water absorption capability. The material of interest
was specifically focused on organic solvent and crude oil absorption
and was surface silane-functionalized for studying the absorption.
The tailoring from superhydrophilic to hydrophobic was confirmed from
contact angle measurements. It was recorded that the long alkyl chain
length of silane and the surface functional groups could bring about
oleophilic and hydrophobic qualities of the absorbent sponge. The
absorption capacity increases with an increase in density and decreases
with an increase in viscosity of the test liquids. The absorbent material
surface-functionalized with long-alkyl-chain silane has the potential
to be used in both open waterways and a sea water environment, which
makes the absorbent a prospective candidate. However, studies on scaling
up the absorbent to meet practical situations and complete regeneration
of the sponge after crude oil absorption require further attention.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals and Materials
All the chemicals
used in this work were of reagent grade and used without any further
treatment. Sodium silicate with 7.5–8.5% Na2O and
SiO2 25.5–28.5% SiO2 purchased from Merck
(Germany) was used as the inorganic silica source. Octadecyltrimethoxysilane
(OTMS) and vinyl trimethoxysilane (VTMS) were procured from Sigma
Aldrich (USA). Trimethylethoxysilane (TMES) from Fluka was used. Poly(vinyl
alcohol) (PVA; 86–89% hydrolyzed) was purchased from Alfa Aesar.
Hydrochloric acid (HCl), poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), and formaldehyde
were procured from Merck, India. 20W-40 4T engine oil from Castrol
India Ltd. (Mumbai), crude oil from Kochi Refinery Ltd., paraffin
oil and other organic solvents (hexane and toluene) from Fisher Scientific
India, and kerosene purchased from the local market were used as adsorbates.

4.2 Inorganic–Organic Hybrid Sponge (IOHS)
Synthesis
The synthesis procedure for the preparation of
a stable IOHS, which was standardized after numerous attempts by trial
and error, is detailed as follows: The IOHS was prepared by cross-linking
and polymerization of the precursors 10 wt % PVA solution, PEG, silica
sol, 37% formaldehyde, and 50% HCl. The volume ratio of silica sol
to PVA solution is maintained as 1:0.4. Initially, the PVA solution
was vigorously agitated with PEG to form a smooth foam followed by
the addition of a previously prepared silica sol (sodium silicate
was dissolved in distilled water and made up to 25% homogeneous solution
at pH 4), formaldehyde, and HCl in succession. The whole process is
carried out at 80 °C. When the solution became viscous, it was
immediately transferred to a mold and kept intact for 4 days after
which the synthesized sponge is squeezed and washed with surplus water
until the pH of the supernatant turned neutral. The sponge is squeezed
to remove all the water, kept in hexane for solvent exchange of the
residual water trapped in the inside pores, and dried under ambient
conditions. For comparison purposes, the PVA–formaldehyde sponge
without any silica was also prepared.

4.2.1 Preparation
of Hydrophobic Sponges
Three silanes, octadecyltrimethoxysilane
(OTMS), vinyl trimethoxysilane
(VTMS), and trimethylethoxysilane (TMES), were studied for imparting
hydrophobicity to the samples. The prepared IOHS after solvent exchange
with hexane is placed as such in a solution having 8% silane in hexane
media. The whole system is given a mild mechanical stirring for 24
h. The samples were withdrawn, washed with fresh hexane three times
to remove the excess silane, and dried. Hereafter, the samples are
denoted as IOHSO, IOHSV, and IOHSE for OTMS-, VTMS-, and TMES-modified
hydrophobic sponges, respectively.

4.3 Characterization
of Hybrid Sponges
The thermal conductivity of the absorbent
material is found using
the instrument KD2 Pro (Decagon Devices, Inc.). The micromorphological
features of the samples were investigated using scanning electron
microscopes (SEM) Zeiss EVO 18 cryo SEM and JOEL JSM-5600LV. A XEUSS
SAXS/WAXS system was used to perform wide-angle XRD (WAXD) analysis
with a Genix microsource from Xenocs operated at 50 kV and 0.6 mA
(λCu = 0.154 nm). The 2D patterns were processed
using Fit2D software. The water contact angle was observed using a
Kruss drop shape analyzer at ambient temperature using water as the
probe liquid (∼3 μL). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
analysis in attenuated total reflectance (ATR) mode was used to study
the functional group characteristic of the samples using the Perkin
Elmer series FTIR spectrometer. The thermal stability of the samples
was determined by thermogravimetric analysis using TG apparatus (Perkin
Elmer 6000, the Netherlands).

Porosity of the hydrophobic sponge
was calculated from the apparent and bulk density values46 based on the eq 4 4  where ρIOHSx is the apparent density of
the hydrophilic/hydrophobic
sponge and ρs is the bulk density of the sample.

The apparent density of the sample was calculated by measuring
the dimensions of the sample using a Vernier caliper and mass using
a weighing balance. The bulk density of sodium silicate is taken to
be 2.4 g cm–1.

The adhesive force between
the water droplet and the hybrid sponges
was calculated using the Young–Dupre equation48 5  where WSL is the work of adhesion, ΥL is the liquid
surface tension, and θ is the contact angle made by the liquid
droplet with the sample surface.

4.4 Procedures
for Absorption Studies
Six types of test liquids—hexane,
kerosene, chloroform, paraffin
oil, engine oil, and crude oil—were selected to identify the
oil absorption efficiency of macroporous sponges. The polar volatile
organic compounds are represented by hexane and chloroform; lower-viscosity
oils like gasoline, diesel, and so on are represented by kerosene;
and paraffin oil and engine oil represents highly viscous oils. Oils
can be classified as light, medium, heavy, and weathered depending
on the viscosity and density values as shown in Table 1. The physical properties of the test liquids
selected are listed in Table 2.

Table 1 Classification of Different Types
of Oils
oil type	viscosity
range (cP)	density range (g cm–3)	
light	1–10	0.820–0.870	
medium	200–400	0.860–0.930	
heavy	1500–2500	0.930–1.000	
weathered	8000–10000	0.930–1.000	
Table 2 Physical
Properties of Test Liquids
Selected for the Experiment
test liquid	viscosity
(cP) (20 °C)	density (g cm–3)	
hexane	0.29	0.66	
kerosene	1.64	0.81	
chloroform	0.53	1.49	
paraffin oil	1000	0.80	
engine oil	6600	0.88	
light crude oil (API° = 90)	8.04	0.64	
All the
oil absorption experiments were performed in agreement
with the ASTM standard method of testing sorbent performance (F726-99).47 The test protocol includes the dynamic degradation
test and the oil absorption short test (15 min).

4.4.1 Dynamic
Degradation Test
The method
examines the parameters buoyancy, hydrophobicity, and oleophilicity
of the samples under dynamic conditions. Typically, a known weight
of the sample is placed in a sealed jar half-filled with water and
mechanically rotated for 15 min, and the contents are allowed to be
static for 2 min. If greater than 10% of the sample is found to be
submerged or the water column is observed to be contaminated with
the sorbent particles, then the adsorbent is not recommended for use
in open water. The sample is removed to determine the water pick-up
ratio. In the next stage, 4 mL of oil is added to the surface of the
test jar, and the same procedure is repeated, this time to notice
any oil sheen on the water surface.

4.4.2 Oil
Absorption—Short Test (15 min)
The pick-up ratio of
the absorbent for the test liquids under stagnant
conditions is determined through this procedure. The weight of the
hybrid sponge is noted and placed in a test cell filled with the oil.
After 15 min, the samples are withdrawn and allowed to drain for 30
s (for highly viscous liquids, 2 min is allowed for draining). The
final weight is noted, and the tests are run in triplicate.
