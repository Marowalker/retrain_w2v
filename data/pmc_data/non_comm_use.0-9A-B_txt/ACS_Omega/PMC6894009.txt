Flexible and rigid residues in disulfide-bridged and
phosphorylated
proteins have been estimated by using MALDI in-source decay mass spectrometry
(ISD MS). The MALDI-ISD spectra of bovine α-lactoalbumin, β-lactoglobulin
A, and β-casein predict that the backbone amide of Xxx-Asp/Asn/Cys/Ser/pSer
and Gly-Xxx residues has higher hydrogen accessibility than other
residues, while Xxx-Ile/Val residues have less accessibility. The
higher hydrogen-accessible and lower accessible residues as measured
by MALDI-ISD are consistent with the flexible and rigid residues determined
by X-ray, nuclear magnetic resonance, and fluorescence decay methods.
The disulfide bridges and phosphate groups do not prevent the estimation
of flexible or rigid residues, whereas some other disulfide bridges
inhibit the identification because of decreased sensitivity of ISD
fragment ions. The estimation of flexible and rigid residues by means
of the matrix-hydrogen accessibility can be explained by exposure
or lack thereof to the hydrogen-accessible sites of intact proteins.
It is proposed that MALDI-ISD is a powerful tool for identifying flexible
and rigid residues of posttranslational modified proteins without
the conformation information of the protein data bank.

Introduction
The study of flexibility of protein molecules
is a long standing
subject in protein science of great importance, owing to its influence
on protein–protein, protein–nucleic acid, and protein–drug
interactions. The flexibility concerns with the redox and posttranslational
modifications, while such a property is represented by practically
important concept of intrinsically disordered proteins.1−3 The flexible nature of the motion of the backbone and sidechains
and the interaction properties of proteins can be estimated using
X-ray crystallography,3−7 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy,8,9 and
fluorescence decay.10 A number of measures
of flexibility are based on these methods. These include the B-factor as a measure of flexibility of amino acid residues,
which is defined by the sidechain mobility on the basis of X-ray studies.3−5 Another measure, the turn preference factor is also based on X-ray
studies and is useful for estimating flexibility of residues.6,7 The B-factor and the turn preference factor predict
that Asp, Asn, Gly, Pro, Lys, Glu, Gln, and Ser residues3−5 and Asp, Asn, Gly, Pro, Cys, and Ser residues6,7 are
more flexible than other residues, respectively. The protection factor
based on the hydrogen/deuterium exchange reaction in NMR suggests
that residues that interact most with environmental water molecules
are Asp, Asn, Gly, Lys, Thr, Ile, and Met.8,9 Measurements
using fluorescence decay predict that Asp, Asn, Gly, Ser, and Ala
residues are more flexible than others.10 However, the identification of flexibility of residues in proteins
can be time consuming and relies on structural characterization. The
development of quick and straightforward techniques to achieve the
identification of flexible and rigid residues is strongly desired
by protein scientists.

We have reported that a reaction of in-source
decay (ISD) coupled
with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry
(MALDI MS) is usable for predicting the turn preference or flexible
residues of intact proteins.11−15 MALDI-ISD is a unique method for rapidly identifying intact posttranslational
modified proteins without the need for enzymatic digestion.16,17 The ISD experiments result in specific cleavage at the N–Cα
bond of the backbone of peptides and proteins when hydrogen-donating
matrices such as 2,5-dihydroxylbenzoic acid (2,5-DHB)18,19 and 5-amino-1-naphthol (5,1-ANL)12,13 are used.
These matrices generate abundant hydrogen radicals from the anilinic
amino group (Ph-NH2) and the phenolic hydroxyl group (Ph-OH)
under ultraviolet (UV) MALDI conditions. The MALDI-ISD experiments
result in discontinuous intense peaks corresponding to c-ions originating
from cleavage at the N–Cα bond of the Xxx-Asp, Xxx-Asn,
Xxx-Cys, and Gly-Xxx residues,11−15 which are compatible with the identification of flexible residues
by X-ray, NMR, and fluorescence decay methods.

The hydrogen
radicals generated under MALDI conditions attach to
the backbone carbonyl oxygens to form c-ions (Scheme 1C)19 and can reduce
the disulfide bridge (S–S) to form sulfhydryl groups (−SH
HS−) in protein molecules,20,21 while the
presence of a disulfide bridge in a small cyclic peptide does not
result in the formation of c-ions.22 It
is of interest to ask whether the resulting hydrogen radicals are
able to simultaneously cleave both the backbone N–Cα
bond and disulfide bridge (S–S). It is also of interest to
examine the influence of disulfide bridges and phosphate groups on
the N–Cα bond cleavage in the formation of c-ions and
to find discontinuous and lower intensity c-ion peaks. This would
thereby identify both residues with higher matrix-hydrogen accessibility
and residues with lower accessibility in intact proteins and measure
the influence of disulfide bridges. It is expected, therefore, that
effective and noneffective cleavage of the backbone N–Cα
bond and the disulfide bridge is a function of whether the backbone
carbonyl oxygens and disulfide bridges are exposed or hidden from
the matrix molecules.

Here, we estimate flexible and rigid residues
of posttranslational
modified proteins such as bovine α-lactoalbumin (α-LA, Mr 14220), bovine β-lactoglobulin A (β-LGA, Mr 18363), and bovine β-casein (β-CN, Mr 23983) using the MALDI-ISD. α-LA contains four
disulfide bridges (Cys6-Cys120, Cys28-Cys111, Cys61-Cys77, and Cys73-Cys91),
β-LGA contains one sulfhydryl (Cys121) and two disulfide bridges
(Cys66-Cys160 and Cys106-Cys119), and β-CN has five phosphorylated
serine residues (pSer15, pSer17, pSer18, pSer19, and pSer35).

Results and Discussion
MALDI-ISD spectra of bovine
α-LA, β-LGA, and β-CN
obtained with the 5,1-ANL matrix are shown in Figures 1–3, respectively. All the spectra showed analyte ions such as
[M + H]+ (or [M – H]−) and [M
+ 2H]2+ (or [M – 2H]2–). The resulting
fragment c-ions observed in the ISD spectra originate from the cleavage
at the backbone N–Cα bond (Scheme 1). The series of c-ions observed give definite
sequence information, because the difference in m/z values Δ (m/z) between adjacent c-ions is equal to the mass of amino acid residues.16−19

The c-ions observed in the MALDI-ISD mass spectrum
of α-LA
can be divided into three regions in terms of peak intensity, namely
high-intensity ions c10 to c27, medium-intensity ions c28 to c60,
and low-intensity ions c61 and above (Figure 1). The peak intensity boundaries at c27/c28
and c60/c61 ions correspond to the presence of disulfide bridges Cys28-Cys111
and Cys61-Cys77, respectively. This indicates that the presence of
disulfide bridges decreases the intensity of c-ions, because the S–S
bridges inhibit the separation of c-ions from covalent S–S-bridged
analyte ions [M + H]+. The c-ions in the MALDI-ISD mass
spectrum of β-LGA can be divided into two regions, namely high-intensity
ions c10 to c65 and low-intensity ions c66 and above (Figure 2). The drastic drop in the
c-ion intensity boundary at c65/c66 suggests that simultaneous cleavage
of both the disulfide bridge Cys66-Cys160 and the N–Cα
bond is rare, while the N-terminal side backbone chain from Leu1 to
Glu56 can easily form c-ions because of the absence of disulfide bridges.
The MALDI-ISD mass spectrum of β-CN was obtained in negative-ion
mode owing to the electronegative nature of phosphate groups (Figure 3). The spectrum shows
a lot of c-ions reflecting both information of the sequence and the
sites of phosphorylated-serine residues (pS14, pS17, pS18, pS19, and
pS35) (Figure S3).

Higher Matrix-Hydrogen Accessible Residues Giving Discontinuous
Intense c-Ions
The peak intensity of c-ions observed in the
MALDI-ISD spectra obtained with hydrogen-donating matrix is mainly
governed by two factors, namely, (1) ionization efficiency (protonation/deprotonation)
concerned with the presence of basic and acidic residues and (2) hydrogen-accessibility
of the backbone carbonyl oxygens.22,23 It should
be noted that specific and prompt cleavage at the N–Cα
bond of the peptide backbone to form c-fragments takes place independently
of the ionization, while the c-ions are produced on several ns time
scales in the MALDI ion source.18,19,22,23

The discontinuous intense
c-ion peaks in the ISD spectrum of α-LA were observed with the
cleavage at the N–Cα bond of the Arg10-Glu11, Lys13-Asp14,
Gly17-Tyr18, Ser22-Leu23, Val27-Cys28, Tyr36-Asp37, Gln43-Asn44, Asn44-Asn45,
Asn45-Asp46, Ile55-Asn56, Asn56-Asn57, Trp60-Cys61, and Gln65-Asn66
residues (Figure S1). The spectrum also
showed two peaks corresponding to carboxyl (C)-terminal side w13 and
w33 ions originating from cleavage at both the backbone N–Cα
and sidechain Cβ–Cγ bonds of the Leu109-Cys110
and Met89-Cys90 residues (Scheme 1D), respectively. The observed intense c- and w-ions
are shown in Scheme 2 and summarized in Table 1. The discontinuous intense c-ion peaks of β-LGA were
observed with cleavage at the N–Cα bond of the Leu10-Asp11,
Gly17-Thr18, Tyr20-Ser21, Ser27-Asp28, Ser36-Ala37, Val41-Tyr42, Gly52-Asp53,
Glu62-Asn63, Asn63-Asp64, Glu65-Cys66, Leu87-Asn88, Glu89-Asn90, Leu95-Asp96,
and Thr97-Asp98 residues (Figure S2). The
w- and z-ions were also observed in the spectrum. The resulting fragment
ions are shown in Scheme 3 and summarized in Table 1. With regard to the specific formation of w-ions (Scheme 1D), it is proposed
that the Cys residue or the sulfhydryl group (−SH) has a high
susceptibility to the hydrogen access and the loss of an SH radical.
Negative-ion MALDI-ISD experiments with β-CN resulted in sequence
reflecting c-ions without the loss of phosphate groups. Relatively
intense c-ion peaks were observed resulting from the cleavage at the
N–Cα bonds of the Leu6-Asn17, Gly10-Glu11, Glu14-pSer15,
Leu16-pSer17, pSer17-pSer18, pSer18-pSer19, Glu21-Ser22, Lys28-Lys29,
Gln34-pSer35, Glu42-Asp43, Gln46-Asp47, Glu89-Asn90, Ile49-His50,
Phe52-Ala53, and Gln56-Ser59 residues (Figure S3). The results obtained indicate that phosphate groups of
the pSer residues do not inhibit the access of hydrogens to backbone
carbonyl oxygens in the formation of c-ions. The intense c-ion peaks
of β-CN are shown in Scheme 4 and summarized in Table 1. In order to investigate the influence of
phosphorylation of serine residues, furthermore, a model peptide of
bovine β-casein having four phosphate groups (RELEELNVPGEIVEpSLpSpSpSEESITRINKK)
was used for estimating the flexible amino acids. The MALDI-ISD spectra
showed relatively intense peaks corresponding to the c-ions originating
from cleavage at the N–Cα bond of the Gly10-Glu, Leu16-pSer,
Glu21-Ser, and Ile26-Asn residues, while cleavage at the Glu11-Ile,
Ile12-Val, pSer19-Glu, Ser22-Ile, and Arg25-Ile residues gave lower
intense c-ions (ISD data not shown). The detailed analysis of this
model peptide is described in the later section (Figure S4).

From the results obtained above, the MALDI-ISD experiments
of posttranslational
modified proteins predict that Xxx-Asp, Xxx-Asn, Gly-Xxx, Xxx-Ser,
and Xxx-Cys are more hydrogen-accessible than other residues. Indeed,
it is of interest that the matrix-hydrogen accessible residues identified
by MALDI-ISD (Asp, Asn, Gly, Ser, and Cys) are consistent with the
flexible residues predicted by B-factor (Asp, Asn,
Gly, Pro, Lys, Glu, Gln, and Ser),3−5 the turn preference factor
(Asp, Asn, Gly, Pro, Cys, and Ser),6,7 the protection
factor (Asp, Asn, Gly, Lys, Thr, Ile, and Met),8,9 and
the fluorescence decay factor (Asp, Asn, Gly, Ser, and Ala),10 although identification of some residues depends
on the method used.

In order to estimate quantitatively the
more and less accessibility
of hydrogens to the carbonyl oxygens of amino acid residues of analyte
proteins α-LA, β-LGA, and β-CN, the intensity ratio R(Cn) for n-th c-ion can be defined by the ratio of the intensity of n-th c-ion Int(Cn) to the average
intensity of adjacent side c-ion peaks as follows.13,14 1  

The intensity ratios were calculated
from the intensity of c-ions
observed in the enlarged MALDI-ISD mass spectra of α-LA, β-LGA,
and β-CN (Figures S1–S3),
and the cleavage residues and corresponding intensity ratios are summarized
in Table S1. The intensity ratio for each
amino acid residue averaged with all combinations in the three different
proteins indicates that Xxx-Cys/Asp/Asn/Ser and Gly-Xxx residues give
the values over 1.0 and Xxx-Val/Ile residues give lower than 1.0,
while Xxx-Glu/Ala residues give approximately 1.0, as shown in Figure 4 and Table 2. The intensity ratios estimated
from positive- and negative-ion MALD-ISD spectra of the model peptide
of β-casein also gave the same tendency with the values for
proteins used here (Figure S4). The statistical t-test was performed for Xxx-Asp/Asn/Cys/Ser(pSer)/Ala/Glu,
Gly-Xxx, and Xxx-Val/Ile residues, while the data for Xxx-Cys, Lys-Lys,
Xxx-Pro, Arg-Xxx, and Phe52-Ala were deleted from a population showed
in Table S1 to avoid unnatural deviation.
The average intensity ratio, probability (p), and t-value for each residue are summarized in Table 2.

Gly, Glu, Ala, Val, and Ile residues estimated
from the ISD data of α-LA, β-LGA, and β-CN, as shown
in Figures S1–S3.

Lower Matrix-Hydrogen Accessible Residues Giving Discontinuous
Lower Intensity c-Ions
In contrast to the more hydrogen accessible
residues described above, the MALDI-ISD spectra also showed discontinuous
lower intensity c-ions. The lower intensity c-ions, as observed in Figure 1, for α-LA
were c20, c26, c28, c40, c41, c54, c58, and c59 originating from cleavage
at the N–Cα bond of the Gly-Val, Trp-Val, Cys-Thr, Ala-Ile,
Ile-Val, Gln-Ile, Lys-Ile, and Ile-Trp residues, respectively. The
lower intensity c-ions in β-LGA (Figure 2) were c11, c14, c28, c42, and c55 originating
from the N–Cα bond cleavage of the Asp-Ile, Lys-Val,
Asp-Ile, Tyr-Ile, and Glu-Ile residues, respectively. The ISD spectrum
of β-CN also showed lower intensity peaks corresponding to c7,
c11, c12, c19, c22, c29, c45, c48, and c51 originating from cleavage
of the Asn-Val, Glu-Ile, Ile-Val, pSer-Glu, Ser-Ile, Lys-Ile, Leu-Gln,
Lys-Ile, and Pro-Phe residues, respectively. The results obtained
above indicate that Xxx-Val and Xxx-Ile are the residues found with
high frequency in the lower intensity ions. Thus, the backbone carbonyl
oxygens of these residues have decreased hydrogen accessibility. Other
residues such as Xxx-Thr/Trp/Phe also seem to show less access to
matrix. The identification of Val and Ile residues is in accordance
with the rigid residues identified by means of the B-factor,6 the turn preference factor,24 the fluorescence decay,10 and the inhibition of chemical ligation due to steric hindrance.25

Mechanistic Implications of Matrix-Hydrogen Accessibility of
Residues
The matrix-hydrogen accessibility of backbone amides
and disulfide bridges is an important factor in the preferential formation
of c-ions and sulfhydryl groups. The presence of intramolecular hydrogen-bonded
α-helix and β-sheet structures and bulky sidechains inhibits
the access of hydrogens to the backbone carbonyl oxygens. In contrast,
it is important to recognize that the residues and disulfide bridges
exposed at the surface of peptide and protein molecules have increased
the likelihood of accepting hydrogen radicals and thus to take part
in intermolecular hydrogen bonding (Scheme 1A) and form transient hydrogen-excess radical
peptides and proteins (Scheme 1B).15,19 The measurement of matrix-hydrogen
accessibility of residues by MALDI-ISD indicates that backbone amides
of Xxx-Asp/Asn/Cys/Ser and Gly-Xxx residues exposed at the surface
of intact proteins are able to interact with matrix active-hydrogens,
while those of Xxx-Ile/Val residues are hidden from the active-hydrogens.
Such mechanistic implications of the Asp/Asn/Cys/Ser/Gly and Ile/Val
residues are compatible with the identification of the flexible and
rigid residues obtained from the B-factor, the turn
preference factor, the protection factor, and the fluorescence decay
factor. Furthermore, the disulfide bridges at Cys6-Cys120 and Cys28-Cys110
of α-LA easily interact with matrix active-hydrogens to form
sulfhydryl groups (Scheme 2), while Cys60-Cys78 and Cys73-Cys90 of α-LA and Cys66-Cys160
and Cys106-Cys119 of β-LGA are relatively hidden from the active-hydrogens
(Schemes 2 and 3). It is also of interest from the standpoint of
protein conformation that the backbone amide carbonyl oxygens of the
pSer residues of β-CN preferentially interact with the matrix
hydrogens to form intense c-ions, given that there is no conformation
information in the protein data bank for β-CN. This indicates
that phosphate groups of β-CN do not inhibit the access of matrix
hydrogens.

Conclusions
The flexible and rigid residues of posttranslational
modified proteins
bovine α-lactoalbumin (α-LA), β-lactoglobulin A
(β-LGA), and β-casein (β-CN) were estimated by using
MALDI-ISD. Discontinuous intense or lower intensity fragment c-ions
observed in MALDI-ISD spectra of α-LA, β-LGA, and β-CN
predict that backbone amides of the Xxx-Asp/Asn/Cys/Ser and Gly-Xxx
residues have higher accessibility to matrix-hydrogens than other
residues, while those of the Xxx-Ile/Val residues have lower accessibility.
Indeed, the higher matrix-hydrogen accessible Asp, Asn, Cys, Ser,
and Gly residues and lower accessible Ile and Val residues estimated
by MALDI-ISD are consistent with the flexible and rigid residues,
respectively, determined by X-ray, NMR, and fluorescence decay methods.
The disulfide bridges at Cys6-Cys120 and Cys28-Cys110 of α-LA
are easily reduced by matrix-hydrogens and do not inhibit the formation
of c-ions, while the disulfide bridges at Cys60-Cys78 and Cys73-Cys90
of α-LA and at Cys66-Cys160 and Cys106-Cys119 of β-LGA
inhibit the formation of c-ions. This indicates that these disulfide
bridges are hidden from the matrix-hydrogens. The phosphate groups
of β-CN do not inhibit cleavage at the N–Cα bond,
and the c-ions originating from cleavage at the N–Cα
bond of the Xxx-Ser/pSer residues show more intense peaks than other
residues, suggesting that backbone carbonyl oxygens of the Xxx-Ser/pSer
residues of β-CN are exposed to the matrix-hydrogens. Thus,
the MALDI-ISD is a powerful tool for predicting flexible and rigid
residues of posttranslational modified proteins, owing to the fast
and easy capabilities and small sample amount requirements compared
to conventional X-ray, NMR, and fluorescence decay methods.

Experimental Details
Chemicals
MALDI matrix 5-amino-1-naphthol (5,1-ANL)
was purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry (Tokyo, Japan). Acetonitrile
was purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). Water used
in all experiments was purified using a MilliQ water purification
system from Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA). Bovine α-lactoalbumin,
bovine β-lactoglobulin A, and bovine β-casein were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO, USA). A model peptide of bovine
β-casein was supplied from the Peptide Institute (Minoh, Osaka,
Japan). All reagents were used without further purification.

Sample Preparation
Each protein for the ISD experiment
combined with MALDI-TOF MS was dissolved in 200 μL of water
at a concentration of 100 μM in a 600 μL microtube . The
matrix 5,1-ANL (3 mg) was dissolved in a solvent of 150 μL of
water/acetonitrile (3:7, v/v). The matrix and analyte solutions were
prepared without any additives such as trifluoroacetic acid. A sample
solution was prepared by mixing a 10 μL volume of analyte solution
with a 10 μL volume of matrix solution by using a shaker just
before MALDI-ISD experiments. A 1.0 μL volume of the sample
solution was deposited onto a stainless-steel target for the MALDI
plate made of stemless steel with a 10 μL micropipette, and
the solvents were removed by allowing evaporation in air at room temperature.

Mass Spectrometry
MALDI-ISD spectra were acquired on
a time-of-flight mass spectrometer AXIMA-CFR (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan)
equipped with a nitrogen laser (337 nm wavelength) operating at a
pulse rate of 10 Hz. The pulse width of the laser was 4 ns. The laser
spot size on the target substrate was ca. 100 μm in diameter.
The ions generated by MALDI were accelerated using 20 kV with delayed
extraction. The analyzer was operated in a linear mode, and the ions
were detected using a secondary electron multiplier. A total of 500
shots were accumulated for each mass spectrum acquisition. The reproducibility
of all mass spectra was confirmed by the peak intensity patterns for
several runs using the raster function installed on the AXIMA-CFR
mass spectrometer. The reproducibility of MALDI-ISD patterns of the
analyte proteins with 5,1-ANL matrix was confirmed with different
experimentalists and on different days.
