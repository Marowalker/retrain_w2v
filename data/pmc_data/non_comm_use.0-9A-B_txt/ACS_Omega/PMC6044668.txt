The
purpose of this study was to investigate the adsorption mechanism
in reversed-phase chromatography (RPC) of proteins and to develop
a model for the effect of dual mobile phase modulators—a salt
and an organic solvent—on this process. Two different adsorption
mechanisms were considered: (1) pure association of a protein molecule
and one or more ligands and (2) displacement of the organic modulator,
with which the adsorbent is saturated, by the protein upon association
with one or more ligands. One model was then derived from each of
the two considered mechanisms, combining thermodynamic theories on
salting-in, RPC, and the solubility of proteins. The model was then
applied to chromatographic data from an earlier report as well as
supplementary data for solubility and vapor–liquid equilibria,
and case-specific simplifications were made. We found that an adaptation
of Kirkwood’s electrostatic theories to hydrophobic interaction
chromatography describes the observed effect of KCl well. Combining
chromatographic and solubility data for one of the insulins, we concluded
that the variation in the activity coefficient of the insulin with
respect to the concentration of ethanol alone cannot describe its
effect on retention. Consequently, one or more other phenomena must
affect the adsorption process. Our second model fits the retention
data well, supporting the hypothesis that ethanol is directly involved
in the adsorption mechanism in this case. Using additional experiments
at a high-protein load, we extended the linear-range equilibrium model
into a dynamic model for preparative conditions. This model shows
good agreement with the high-load data for one of the insulin variants,
without any additional effects of the modulator concentrations on
the adsorption capacity.

1 Introduction
Hydrophobicity is a physical
property of a compound that denotes
the degree to which the compound repels water. Accordingly, the aggregation
of nonpolar molecules in an aqueous solution is caused by an effect
termed the hydrophobic effect. Although the definitions
of hydrophobicity and the hydrophobic effect are clear and simple,
the phenomena per se—especially their quantification—are
complex.1 The current, long-standing consensus1−5 is that water and its displacement or rearrangement play an important
role in the hydrophobic effect. There are several theories on the
extent of this rearrangement, spanning from the creation of quasi-crystalline icebergs(4) to a decrease in the
volume in which hydrogen bonding can occur.1 From these theories on hydrophobicity and the hydrophobic effect,
different models that describe and predict the related phenomena—for
example, partitioning between phases, aggregation in aqueous solvents,
and adsorption of adsorbates to ligands1,2—have
been developed.

The last of the mentioned phenomena forms the
basis of separation
in reversed-phase chromatography (RPC) and hydrophobic interaction
chromatography (HIC). Both HIC and RPC are frequently applied for
chromatographic purification of biomolecules, such as peptides and
proteins, primarily in the biopharmaceutical industry.6,7 Although preparative HIC and RPC are used extensively in the downstream
processing of these products, there is no broad consensus on the nature
of the underlying mechanisms nor on which theory best describes these
processes.

Some of the most widely recognized theories on retention
in HIC
are the adaptations of the solvophobic8 and preferential interaction9,10 theories to HIC, as
well as that of Kirkwood’s electrostatic theories on macromolecules
in solution by Mollerup and co-workers.11,12 The corresponding
theories for RPC are the adaptation of the solvophobic theory to RPC;13 the partition model that was developed by Dill
and co-workers14−16 and the adsorption model by Scott and Kucera.17−19 A number of proposed theories have combined adsorption and partition
models.20 Most of the theories and models
mentioned above have been developed mainly for small molecules and/or
for the linear adsorption range and are thus not generally applicable
to preparative chromatography of proteins and peptides. Additionally,
some of them include parameters that are difficult to measure or relate
to physical properties.

Models that are based on mechanisms
and physical principles, rather
than fitted polynomials or quantitative structure–property
relationships, enable the use of supplementary physical-property data
from nonchromatographic experiments, more reliable extrapolation,
and possibly predictions about similar adsorbate(s)–adsorbent–modulator(s)
systems, for example, the effect of changing the adsorbent.12 In a previous study,21 we examined the combined effects of ethanol and KCl on the retention
of three insulin variants on two RPC adsorbents. One of our main findings
was that a change of adsorbents or in the KCl concentration only caused
a parallel shift of the curve, describing the effect of ethanol on
linear-range retention of the insulin variants. This suggests that,
with a suitable model, the outcome of chromatographic experiments
under varying mobile phase conditions and on different adsorbents
can be predicted from a very limited number of experiments.

In this study, we derived two different chromatographic models
and applied these to the two RPC systems. The models are based on
the two most likely adsorption mechanisms—(1) the association
between a protein molecule and a number of ligands, without direct
involvement of the modulators and (2) the association between a protein
molecule and a number of ligands, accompanied by the displacement
of molecules of the organic modulator from those ligands. In addition
to this possible direct effect of ethanol, it affects the activity
coefficient of the protein in the mobile phase. The influence of the
ethanol concentration on the activity coefficient was estimated from
Wilson’s equation,22 using independent
data for the vapor–liquid equilibrium (VLE) of water and ethanol23 and for the solubility of insulin.

The
HIC model, based on Kirkwood’s electrostatic theories
of macromolecules, by Mollerup et al.12 was used to describe the effect of the salt concentration on the
protein activity. The main aim of this particular study is to develop
a first principle model for RPC of proteins with dual modulators and
to evaluate this model for the RPC data from our previous study. This
also requires an investigation of what adsorption mechanism is most
likely. The overall goal of this series of studies is to develop a
model that can be used for the development, analysis, and optimization
of RPC separations of proteins, employing dual-modulator gradients.

1.1 Theoretical Basis
The derivation
of the correlation for the protein retention is based on the adsorption
equilibrium. For RPC, however, we must first make an assumption regarding
the nature of the retention mechanism. Because the highly hydrophobic
ligands of RPC adsorbents can have the properties of a separate liquid
phase, the retention might be due to partitioning into that phase
rather than adsorption onto the ligands.14 It has proved to be difficult to distinguish between these phenomena,24,25 prompting theories that combine the two mechanisms to be developed.26

However, proteins and other adsorbates
that are several orders of magnitude larger than the ligands on the
adsorbent cannot be submerged in a potential hydrophobic liquid phase
unless their morphology changes drastically, such that their peptide
chains are elongated and interlaced with the ligands. This morphological
change would entail the denaturing of the proteins and peptides, which,
of course, is undesirable. Another possibility is the formation of
an interfacial region with a higher ethanol content, between the ligands
and the bulk liquid, which the adsorbates partition into. Considering
that the diameter of insulin, which is a small protein, is around
10% of that of the particle pores for the adsorbents used in this
study, we find this alternative possible but less likely than adsorption.
We have thus decided to assume that the retention of the insulin variants
is governed by an adsorption mechanism.

1.1.1 Adsorption
Mechanisms
Adsorption
can be caused by two main different mechanisms—reversible association
of the protein (P) and ν ligands (L) into the complex PLν (eq 1)
or the displacement of νξ adsorbed modulator molecules
(M) by the protein when it binds reversibly to ν ligands (L)
and forms the complex PLν (eq 2). 1   2  The process given by eq 2 is equivalent to the generally accepted mechanism
for ion-exchange chromatography, often described by the steric mass
action model by Brooks and Cramer,27 but
here with the presumption of hydrophobic interactions modulated by
an organic solvent instead of electrostatic interactions modulated
by a salt. The species displaced by the protein (M) might also be
water, which commonly constitutes the larger part of the mobile phase
in protein RPC, but with the ligands being highly hydrophobic, adsorption
of the organic solvent used as modulator is more likely. In the case
of such a displacement process, the stationary phase is assumed to
be saturated with the modulator. The equilibrium constant for the
adsorption mechanism without (eq 1), Ka, and with displacement (eq 2), Kd, is given by eqs 3 and 4, respectively. Indices a and d denote
association and displacement, respectively. 3   4  where a is the activity, x is the
molar fraction, and γ is the activity coefficient. cP [mol/m3] is the concentration of
the protein in the mobile phase, whereas qP [mol/m3 pore volume] is the concentration of the adsorbed
protein in the stationary phase. Reference concentrations for the
pores (cref,s) and the bulk mobile phase
(cref,m) are needed because of the change
from molar fractions to concentrations. In this study, however, the
retention is assumed to be caused by adsorption and not by partitioning.
This assumption implies that the stationary and mobile phases are
not two separate phases in the thermodynamic sense. Consequently, cref,s equals cref,m, enabling the simplification in the last step in eqs 3 and 4.

The molar fraction of free ligands, xL, can be calculated from eq 5, where Λ is the ligand density. ctot is the total molarity of the mobile phase and N is the total number of adsorbates. σi is the shielding factor for adsorbate i,
that is, the number of ligands that are sterically hindered from binding
to other protein molecules but are not included in the complex PLν, which constitutes the hindrance. 5  

For the linear adsorption
range, the concentration of adsorbed
proteins is negligible, and the simplification to the right in eq 5 can be used. The equilibrium
expression in eq 2 postulates
that all ligands are occupied—with either proteins or solvent
molecules. This means that xMξL in eq 4 can
be replaced by the expression for xL (eq 5).

There is a possibility
that the ligands are not fully saturated
with the solvent, resulting in a combination of the two mechanisms
in eqs 1 and 2. According to a study by Scott and Simpson, this
is, however, unlikely at ethanol levels above 20 wt %.28 In the RPC processes used by Novo Nordisk A/S,
Bagsværd, Denmark, the ethanol content is 20–50 wt %,29 and this is likely the case for most of the
RPC processes for the purification of proteins or peptides in which
ethanol is used as a modulator. Additionally, the existence of two
different types of adsorption sites would result in fronting peaks—a
phenomenon that has not been observed in the experiments. Another
possibility is that the protein molecules are adsorbed onto the layer
of adsorbed solvent molecules. This would result in the same mechanism
as in eq 1 but with another
value of the equilibrium constant in eq 3.

1.1.2 Thermodynamic Retention
Factor
In this study, the thermodynamic retention factor, A, was used as a measure of protein retention. A is
defined as the initial slope of the adsorption isotherm and is thus
equal to the ratio between qP and cP at a very low protein load—that is,
within the linear adsorption range. A can be determined
experimentally from the retention volume under isocratic conditions
and a very low protein load (eq 6). 6  where VR is the
retention volume of the protein, VNR is
its residence volume under nonretaining conditions, and Vpore,access is the particle pore volume accessible to
it. εc and εp are the external and
pore porosities, respectively, and Vcol is the total column volume. kD is the
exclusion factor for the protein on the adsorbent in question—that
is, the fraction of the particle pore volume of the adsorbent that
is accessible to the protein.

Mollerup and co-workers12 have suggested and shown, for some cases, that
the ratio of the activity coefficients of the free ligands (γL) and protein–ligand complexes (γPLν) is reasonably constant, despite changes in the
mobile phase composition. This assumption results in the linear-range
expression for A given by eqs 7 and 8 for the adsorption
mechanism without (eqs 1 and 3) and with displacement (eqs 2 and 4),
respectively. 7   8  where A0 is the
constant for a certain protein–adsorbent–modulator(s)
system. For the mobile-phase compositions commonly used in HIC, the
total molarity (ctot) does not deviate
significantly from that of pure water, and it is often considered
to be a constant.12 This might, however,
not be the case in RPC, and it is thus not certain that ctot can be included in A0.

1.1.3 Effect of the Modulator Salt on the Protein
Activity
Mollerup et al.12 chose
to estimate the variation in γP from the salting-in
(μs-i) and salting-out (μs-o) potentials according to Kirkwood’s theories on the electrostatics
of macromolecules in solution. At low salt concentrations, the protein
solubility increases as the salt concentration increases (salting-in),
whereas the opposite pattern is observed at high salt concentrations
(salting-out). The latter phenomenon is the basis for HIC, in which
the protein retention increases with increasing salt concentration
as the solubility of the protein in the mobile phase decreases. The
effect of the modulator salt on the activity coefficient of the protein,
within the linear adsorption range, is given by eqs 9–11. 9   10   11  where R is the ideal gas
constant, T is the absolute temperature, F is Faraday’s number, and NA is Avogadro’s number. εD is the permittivity
of the mobile phase, which depends on the concentration of the organic
modulator and zP is the charge of the
protein at the specified pH. N is the number of types
of proteins present. κ is the inverse of the Debye length, which
is directly proportional to the ionic strength of the mobile phase
(I) and inversely proportional to T and εD. ηP, τP, and ϕP are the protein- and salt-specific parameters,
related to the dipole moment and size of the protein, and they are
also functions of the concentration of the organic modulator. Details
are found in the previously mentioned paper by Mollerup et al.12

1.1.4 Effect of the Organic
Modulator on the Protein
Activity
The organic modulator can have several different
effects on protein retention. In the case of adsorption of the organic
modulator and displacement of it by the protein, ln(A) is linearly dependent on the natural logarithm of the concentration
and activity coefficient of the modulator (eq 8). Wilson’s equation22 was chosen to describe the effect of the mobile phase composition
on the activity coefficient of the organic modulator (eq 12). 12  

The index W refers to water,
and the
parameters EM,W and EW,M are the binary interaction parameters for the organic
modulator and water. Possible effects of the protein are neglected
because the concentration is generally very low—in this case,
below 0.003 mol/L even under high-load conditions. To include the
effect of the modulator salt, an additional term is needed, for example,
a Debye–Hückel-like term. We have assumed that the main
effect of the salt is on the activity coefficient of the protein,
given by the salting-in and salting-out potentials (eq 9) and thus neglected a possible
Debye–Hückel-like term for the activity coefficient
of the organic modulator. The molar fractions (x)
in eq 12 are thus determined
on a salt-free basis, that is, they differ from those in the expression
for the adsorption equilibrium.

The concentration of the organic
modulator can also affect the
activity coefficient of the protein (γP). This effect
can be described by Wilson’s equation for the system, organic
modulator–water–protein. At very low protein concentrations,
infinite dilution can be assumed, and Wilson’s equation for
this ternary system is simplified to (eq 13): 13  This version of the equation has the same
number of parameters as the original one, but the removal of the dependence
on xP enables further simplification,
accompanied by a parameter reduction (eq 14). 14a   14b   14c   14d  

1.1.5 Protein
Solubility
Information
on the variations in the activity coefficient of a protein in solution
can also be extracted from solubility data. Mollerup et al.12 have previously shown the connection between
solubility and protein retention in HIC, as well as the applicability
of the same model structure to both phenomena. The dissolution of
a solid protein (P) in an aqueous solution can be described by the
reversible process in eq 15, and the equilibrium constant (Ksol) of this process is given by eq 16. 15   16  The activity of a pure compound,
such as the
solid protein, is unity per definition, which means that the product
of the molar fraction and activity coefficient of the dissolved protein
is constant and equal to Ksol (eq 16). Combination of the
expressions for the solubility equilibrium (eq 16) and the activity coefficient at infinite
dilutions (eq 14) gives a model of how xP,aq varies with the composition of the solution.

1.1.6 Dynamic Chromatography Models
The
linear-range equilibrium models can predict the retention as a function
of the mobile phase composition at low protein loads, but for a chromatography
model to be a useful tool for design, tuning, and analysis of preparative
chromatography processes, it must also be able to predict capacity
effects and process dynamics. When the adsorption kinetics are assumed
to be slower than the mass transfer of the protein from the bulk of
the mobile phase to the pore surface, the reaction-dispersive model30 is often applied. The transport of adsorbate i inside of the column packed with adsorbent j is given by eq 17.
Inherent assumptions are radial homogeneity of the column packing
and spatial homogeneity of the porosities. The numerator in front
of the adsorption term corresponds to the pore volume accessible to
adsorbate i, which was chosen as a basis for the
adsorption capacity, and the denominator is the apparent total porosity
of the column for adsorbate i (eq 18). 17   18  where t is the time from
the process start and z is the axial position counting
from the inlet of the column. Dax is the
apparent axial dispersion coefficient and vsup is the superficial linear velocity of the mobile phase. The adsorption
dynamics are given by eqs 19 and 20, where Ai,j describes the equilibrium
for the chosen adsorption mechanism, in this study given by eqs 7 and 8, respectively. 19   20  where kkin,i,j is the kinetic constant for adsorption,
Λj is the ligand density, and N is the number of adsorbate types.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Chromatography Experiments
All experimental
data used for the calibration of the linear-range equilibrium model
were generated in a previous study,21 and
because the experimental procedure used in this study is very similar
to that in the previous one, only a brief description of the method
is presented here, with an emphasis on the differences between the
studies.

The chromatography system used in this study was an
ÄKTApure 25 from GE Healthcare (Uppsala, Sweden) with a 50
mL superloop from the same supplier. For the experimental data taken
from the previous study,21 the corresponding
equipment was an ÄKTAexplorer 10 chromatography system and
an A-900 autosampler, both from GE Healthcare. Three insulin variants
(insulin aspart, desB30 insulin, and an insulin ester) were kindly
provided by Novo Nordisk A/S (Bagsværd, Denmark). All chromatographic
runs were isocratic, and to avoid capacity effects on retention, the
protein load was kept below 0.05 g/L column in the first study. In
this study, three different protein loads were investigated for each
mobile phase composition: approximately 0.1, 1.2, and 12 g/L total
column volume.

Two RPC adsorbents were used: one with C18 ligands and
one with C4 ligands, both of which have a silica backbone
and were obtained from Novo Nordisk Pharmatech A/S (Køge, Denmark).
The pore diameters are within the range 100–300 Å. For
the first study, the adsorbents were packed in Tricorn 10/100 columns
from GE Healthcare at Novo Nordisk; and for this study, the adsorbents
were packed in stainless steel columns by Dr. Maisch GmbH (Ammerbuch,
Germany). Experiments were performed at varying concentrations of
KCl and ethanol. All other experimental conditions, such as pH, temperature,
and flow rate, were fixed throughout the studies.

2.2 Solubility Study
Approximately 1.2
g of crystallized desB30 insulin was added to 10 mL of aqueous solutions
with 0.4 mol KCl/kg, 0.02 mol Tris/kg, pH 7.5, and 16 different ethanol
levels in the range of 23.8–30.7 wt %. The samples were kept
in a blood mixer in a climate chamber at 22 °C over night. The
next day, the samples were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min, and
the supernatant was diluted 1 + 59 with 2 M acetic acid. The concentration
of desB30 insulin in the supernatant was determined using reversed-phase
ultraperformance liquid chromatography, using a chromatography system
from Waters (Milford, Massachusetts, USA). Two different experimental
series, under the same conditions, were made, and the mean value for
each ethanol level was used in the evaluations.

2.3 Modeling
2.3.1 Assumptions, Correlations,
and Literature
Data
An interstitial column porosity of 0.35 was assumed
for both columns used for the high-load experiments, that is, the
stainless steel columns. Using the total porosity values for each
column, estimated from pulse experiments with NaNO3, the
particle porosity for column j was calculated per eq 18, assuming that kD = 1 for the salt. The two C4 columns
were assumed to have the same particle porosity, and the C18 and C4 columns from our previous study21 were assumed to have the same interstitial column porosity.
The three insulin variants were assumed to have the same exclusion
factor, which was estimated for each column in pulse experiments with
desB30 insulin under nonretaining conditions, and calculated per eq 18.

As in our previous
study, the density correlation for the water–ethanol–KCl
system of Galleguillos et al.31 has been
used to calculate concentrations, molar volumes, and other quantities
that depend on the density of the solution. Owing to the lack of available
data, the permittivity of the mobile phase was assumed to be independent
of the KCl concentration. A linear function of the volume fraction
of ethanol was fitted to the experimental data by Åkerlöf32 and Edsall and Wyman.33

The binary interaction parameters for ethanol and water (EM,W and EW,M) were
estimated from VLE data for 25 °C published by Yamamoto et al.23 The vapor pressures of the pure compounds were
taken from the DIPPR 801 Database,34 whereas
the modified Raoult’s law, including activity coefficients
for the liquid phase but not the fugacity coefficients for the vapor
phase, was used to describe the equilibrium.

2.3.2 Calibration
and Simulation
The
parameters of unknown value for the linear-range equilibrium models
are A0′ and νξ, which have one value for each
adsorbate–adsorbent combination; (ητ2)0,P, α, and ω, which are adsorbate- and modulator-specific.
In this case, however, α is assumed to have the same value for
all three insulins. The least squares method was used for the calibration
of these parameters, as well as for the binary interaction parameters
for the ethanol–water system—that is, the residual sum
of squares was chosen as the objective function to be minimized. This
was performed using the MATLAB35 function lsqcurvefit, which is a Gauss–Newton method for nonlinear
optimization. We chose to use Ad and Aa in the calibration, instead of their logarithms,
to avoid giving more weight to data points at lower retention, for
which the precision is lower.

The dynamic high-load simulations
were performed with Matlab, after discretization of the partial differential
equations (PDEs) describing the column and adsorption models, producing
a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In this case, the
PDEs in eq 17 were discretized
into 500 grid points, using the finite volume method with a three-point
central approximation for the dispersion term and a two-point backward
approximation for the convection term. A Dirichlet boundary condition
was applied for the column inlet, whereas the column outlet was described
by a homogenous Neumann condition.

The apparent axial dispersion
coefficient was estimated from the
Péclet number (Pe), the superficial velocity
(vsup), the interstitial porosity (εc,j), and the particle diameter (dp),36 assuming that Pe = 0.5. The Matlab ODE solver ode15s was
used for simulation. Suitable values for Λ and ν were
determined by an iterative method with visual comparison of the experimental
and simulated chromatograms for the highest insulin load (12 g/L)
and subsequent adjustment of the value. The same method was used for
the calibration of kkin, but using data
for 1.2 g insulin/L.

3 Results
and Discussion
The combination of eqs 7, 9, 14a, and 16 gives the structure of the
linear-range adsorption
model for pure adsorption (eq 21), whereas the combination of eqs 8, 9, 14a, and 16 gives that for displacement
of the organic modulator by the protein (eq 22). 21   22  

All simplifications made so
far are based on the assumed adsorption
mechanisms and on the properties of proteins and peptides in general.
Starting from eqs 21 and 22, further case-specific simplifications
can be made based on the experimental and literature data. The simplifications
presented below can be applicable to other cases, but their applicability
must be evaluated for each case.

3.1 Comparison of Ethanol Effect
on Retention
and Solubility
If the retention volume of the insulin variants
varies with the ethanol content of the mobile phase mainly because
of changes in the activity coefficient of the insulin variants, then
the ethanol content should have the same effect on the solubility
of insulin. This is seen from eqs 7 and 16, where the ethanol dependence
is given by its effect on the activity coefficient of the protein.
The logarithm of the retention and of the solubility should thus be
parallel curves. As shown in Figure 1, this was not observed in the experiments.

Figure 1 Natural logarithm
of the retention factor (A)
of desB30 insulin for the experimental series at 0.4 mol KCl/kg and
of the molar fraction of the dissolved desB30 insulin (xdesB30) from the solubility study, plotted against the
molar fraction of ethanol.

The slope of the curves for the logarithm of the retention
factor
(ln(A)) is approximately three times steeper than
that of the curve for the logarithm of the molar fraction of the dissolved
insulin (−ln(xdesB30)). This suggests
that one or more additional phenomena are involved in the adsorption
process, for example, the displacement of ethanol. Simultaneous calibration
of simplified versions of the pure adsorption model (eq 21) and the solubility model (eqs 14a and 16) for desB30 insulin was attempted, but as suspected based
on the results in Figure 1, a satisfactory fit for both retention and solubility data
could not be obtained. Given these results, the pure adsorption model
was not further studied, and we concluded that the likely mechanism
in this case is the one involving modulator displacement (eq 2).

Other possible
explanations are that (1) the assumption of constant
ratio between the activity coefficients of the species in the stationary
phase is invalid; (2) the concentration of desB30 insulin in the solubility
study was too high to assume infinite dilution; or (3) other phenomena,
such as changes in the protein conformation, occur during the adsorption
process. The first and third possibilities are very difficult to explore
and would require extensive investigation of the interactions on the
surface of the adsorbent pores, which exceeds the scope of the current
study.

The second possibility would be somewhat easier to investigate,
but this explanation is less likely. At saturation and within the
interval of ethanol concentrations studied, the molar fraction of
insulin in solution is less than 10–4, that is,
less than 1‰ of xEtOH. Thus, the
insulin concentration has an insignificant effect on the molar fractions
of water and ethanol in the solution; the values of the binary interaction
parameters EM,P, EP,M, EW,P, and EP,W would have to be very high if the concentration of
insulin should have a significant effect on its activity coefficient.

Optimally, the question about the adsorption mechanism should be
answered by searching for a change in the ethanol concentration during
the adsorption and/or desorption. However, simulations with the model
developed in this study (eq 26) showed that breakthrough experiments would only give a change
of 0.2 percentage points, which is probably in the same order of magnitude
as the precision of most measurement methods. A total protein load
of 120 g/L would, according to the simulations, give a change of more
than one percentage point. It might, however, still be difficult to
measure. A number of attempts with an in-line refractive-index detector
were made, but the insulin had such a high impact on the signal that
the potential change due to ethanol adsorption or desorption was undetectable.

3.1.1 Case-Specific Model Simplifications
The retention and
solubility data (Figure 1) suggest an almost linear dependence of
ln(Ad) and especially ln(xP) on the molar fraction of ethanol in the solution. As
a consequence, the flexibility of Wilson’s equation needed
to be restrained. The second last term of eqs 14a, 21, and 22, ln(φ + xM),
will become a constant if φ ≫ xM. If φ ≪ xM, the
term will add a variation of approximately 0.25 to ln(Ad) and ln(xP), which is rather
small in this context. ln(φ + xM) was thus assumed to be constant and was combined with ln(A0) and ln(ω). Similarly, the denominator
in the term including the unknowns α and β only changes
by approximately 6%. Consequently, β/(χxM2 + θxM + EW,M) was also included in the constants. An
even smaller variation, potentially changing ln(Ad) by ±0.01ν, was calculated for ctot. This variable is per se not problematic because its
value can be calculated if the density is known, but both ν
and A0 cannot be estimated from the linear-range
retention data. The assumption that ctot varies insignificantly enables the combination of the factor (Λ/ctot)ν with A0.

The salting-out potential in the HIC model by
Mollerup et al (eq 11) was omitted because the experimental data does exhibit a salting-out
effect. The second term of the salting-in potential (eq 10) is proportional to the protein
concentrations and was thus assumed to be negligible within the linear
range, but it was included in Ai,j for the dynamic adsorption model (eq 19) because this should
be valid for the whole adsorption range. Furthermore, the salting-in
terms of eq 10 were
simplified using two Taylor expansions, resulting in a linear dependence
on κ2 (eq 23) and on the protein concentrations (eq 24), respectively. This also enabled a parameter
reduction by introducing the combined parameter (ητ2)0,P, which is correlated to (ητ2)P, according to eq 25. εratio is the ratio between the
permittivity in the cavity inside of the protein, which should be
that of the free space (ε0) and that of the mobile
phase (εD). Further details on η, τ,
and εratio can be found in ref 12. The approximations
in eqs 23 and 24 are only valid for very small values of τPκ2. 23   24   25  The final form of the models for protein adsorption
involving modulator displacement (eq 26) and for protein solubility (eq 27) is found below. 26   27  

3.2 Combined Calibration of Models for Linear-Range
Adsorption and Protein Solubility
Before calibration of the
adsorption and solubility models, the two binary interaction parameters
for the water–ethanol system were fitted to a set of VLE data,
giving EM,W = 0.7380 and EW,M = 0.2532. Simultaneous calibration of the adsorption
model including modulator displacement (eq 26) and the solubility model (eq 27) against experimental data for
desB30 insulin gave satisfactory results (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Results from the simultaneous calibration of
the adsorption (eq 26) and solubility (eq 27) models against (a)
linear-range retention data and (b) solubility data for desB30 insulin.
The symbols and lines represent data and model response, respectively,
and the KCl concentration is indicated by the color.

Because the difference between the three insulin
variants is small,
they should be equally sized and have similar surface properties.
It was thus assumed that ethanol has the same effect on the activity
coefficient for all three adsorbates, and thus that the same value
of α could be used for all three adsorbates. The results from
the calibration of the adsorption model (eq 26) against the retention data for insulin
aspart and the insulin ester are shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Results from the calibration of the adsorption
model (eq 26) against
linear-range
retention data for (a) insulin aspart and (b) the insulin ester.

The model fit of the insulin ester
is comparable to that of desB30
insulin, whereas that of insulin aspart is less satisfactory, especially
at low KCl concentrations. With the relatively small effect of the
KCl concentration for this adsorbate, resulting in only a slight difference
between the two series at 0.1 and 0.2 mol KCl/kg, this effect is rather
difficult to model. The calibrated values of the final parameter set
for eqs 26 and 27, used for the graphs in Figures 2 and 3, are given
in Table 1, together
with 95% confidence intervals for each parameter. The 95% confidence
intervals confirm that all parameters are significant, and that the
model is rather sensitive to the values of ξν, (ητ2)0,P, and α and less sensitive to ln(Ad,0′) and
ω′.

Because τ0,P and
η0,P were combined
into the parameter (ητ2)0,P, an
estimation of η0,P is needed to assess the validity
of the simplifications (eqs 23 and 24). The criterion is that τPκ2 is small. Assuming that η0,P for the insulin variants is close to that for lysozyme,12 τ0,P ≈ 10–20 and τPκ2 ≈ 0.01, which
should be small enough. The previously estimated molecular radius
of insulin and the calibrated value of (ητ2)0,P result in a dipole moment of 42 D, compared with
the experimentally determined values of 360 D37 and 72 D38 for insulin in solution. Although
our estimated value is outside of this range, it is much closer to
the lower one than the two are to each other, reflecting the difficulty
of obtaining a good estimate.

It is difficult to discuss the
actual values of α because
it is not directly linked to any physical property. However, the excellent
agreement with experimental data for both solubility and retention
(Figure 2) suggests
that the simplified model for the effect of ethanol on the activity
coefficient of the insulin variants describes the phenomenon well,
irrespective of the theoretical validity of the simplifications.

The introduction of
the term for modulator displacement (second term in eq 26) means that, theoretically, a
change in adsorbents does not only cause a change in the value of
ln(A0), that is not only a parallel shift
of the curve for ln(A) as a function of the modulator
concentration. However, the effect of the modulators on the activity
coefficients of the adsorbates is not affected by the type of adsorbent,
even though the hypothesis about a parallel shift between the adsorbents
has been refuted. There are thus two parameter values to adjust for
a new adsorbent, A0 and ν, which
theoretically requires only two experiments at different concentrations
of the organic modulator. If the ligand densities of the adsorbents
differ significantly, adjustment of σ might also be needed.

3.3 Simulations of High-Load Adsorption
In
the dynamic adsorption model (eq 19), there are three adsorption capacity parameters—σ,
ν, and Λ. These are not found in the simplified version
of the linear-range equilibrium model (eq 26) because their effect is observed only at
high-protein loads. Because it is difficult to determine either one
of them from supplementary data, at least one must be estimated from
literature data. Unfortunately, information on the ligand density
for the actual adsorbents used in this study is not available. Instead,
typical ligand densities for the silica-based RPC adsorbents Kromasil,39,40 manufactured by AkzoNobel N.V. (Amsterdam, The Netherlands), were
used. A simple estimation, based on the molar weight of insulin, yields
a molecular radius of approximately 1 nm. Assuming that the insulin
molecules are spherical and can be reached by the ligands below their
circular projection (3.14 nm2 = 3.14 × 10–18 m2), maximally seven ligands could interact with each
insulin molecule. By assuming that σ = 7 – ν, the
number of capacity parameters to calibrate was reduced by one.

The results from the calibration of the capacity and kinetic parameters
for desB30 insulin on the C18 and C4 adsorbents
are found in Figures 4 and 5, respectively. The protein load levels,
12 and 1.2 g/L column, are included, and all injection volumes have
been subtracted. All but one of the experiments performed at 0.7 mol
KCl/kg resulted in chromatograms with two peaks. These eluted 1–2
CV after the start of the elution step, suggesting that the retention
was low enough to cause partial flowthrough. Consequently, these results
were discarded.

Figure 4 Results from the calibration of the dynamic model for
desB30 insulin
on the C18 column at (a) 0.1 mol KCl/kg and (b) 0.4 mol
KCl/kg. Two protein load levels, 12 and 1.2 g/L column, are included
for each ethanol concentration. Solid and dashed lines represent experimental
and simulated chromatograms, respectively.

Figure 5 Results from the calibration of the dynamic model for desB30 insulin
on the C4 column at (a) 0.1 mol KCl/kg and (b) 0.4 mol
KCl/kg. Two protein load levels, 12 and 1.2 g/L column, are included
for each ethanol concentration. Solid and dashed lines represent experimental
and simulated chromatograms, respectively.

The agreement between experiments and simulations is very
good
for the C4 adsorbent and rather good for the C18 adsorbent. Differences in the retention time occur for both adsorbents
at low KCl concentrations, and the simulated peaks are generally sharper
than the experimental ones for the C18 adsorbent. The differences
in the peak shape might be due to the simplification of the mass transfer
effects made using the reaction-dispersive model, in which the rate
limitations in the stationary phase—pore diffusion, stagnant
films, and adsorption kinetics—are lumped together in kkin. Such effects are not the focus of this
study, and therefore, only a simple description of them has been applied.

The slight trend in discrepancy in retention is, however, the same
for the experiments and simulations at lower loads, implying that
this is not a capacity effect. As shown in Figure 2a, the deviation between the experiments
and the model response is more noticeable at lower retention volumes—a
consequence of the higher impact of data points with high values on
the calibration. The deviations in retention at higher loads are thus
only a reflection of those observed for the linear range. The estimated
values of the kinetic constant for the adsorption, the ligand density,
and the stoichiometric coefficient between proteins and ligands are
found in Table 2.

a The ligand density is based on the
total column volume and refers to the number of moles of complete
C18 and C4 ligands.

On the basis of previously estimated sizes of ligands
and ethanol
molecules, there is room for 18–101 and 5–22 ethanol
molecules on each C18 and C4 ligand, respectively,
depending on the orientation of the ethanol molecules. With such large
ranges and the calibrated values being well inside of its limits,
the estimated values of the stoichiometric coefficients ν and
ξ seem reasonable. It might seem strange with a higher ligand
density for the C18 adsorbent than for the C4 one, but this is probably due to the former having a smaller pore
diameter—and thus a larger surface area per volume. The data
sheets from Kromasil also give an idea of the common size and range
of ligand densities for RPC adsorbents, with ∼200 mol/m3 for a 300 Å adsorbent40 and
∼700 mol/m3 for a 100 Å adsorbent.39 The calibrated values of Λ are slightly
lower but still seem plausible.

It is, however, known that the
strong correlation between Λ
and ν makes it difficult to calibrate them simultaneously. A
higher value of one of them can, to a large extent, be compensated
by a higher value of the other, and effects on the peak shape only
become significant for very high values of the two parameters. Consequently,
a reasonable integer value was chosen for the stoichiometric coefficient
and the ligand density was subsequently tuned to maximize the similarity
between the experimental and simulated chromatograms. The important
conclusion that neither the salt nor the ethanol affects the adsorption
capacity is nevertheless still valid.

4 Conclusions
Two RPC models have been evaluated against the retention data for
three insulin variants on two RPC adsorbents, as well as the solubility
data for one of the insulins. The difference between the two models
is the adsorption mechanism: one assumes a pure association between
a protein molecule and a number of ligands, whereas the other assumes
that the ligands initially are saturated with organic modulator and
that a number of adsorbed modulator molecules are displaced upon the
adsorption of an adsorbate molecule. The experiments were performed
with dual modulators, KCl and ethanol, to evaluate the performance
of models that combine the theories for the effect of salt and that
of an organic modulator on protein retention.

Our main findings
were that the effect of ethanol on the retention
of desB30 insulin is stronger than that on the solubility of the same
protein, and that there is no significant effect of the modulator
concentrations on the adsorption capacity. The first observation means
that the change in the activity coefficient of desB30 insulin, which
results in a variation in solubility, cannot alone explain the effect
of ethanol on retention. Consequently, one or more additional phenomena
must be involved in the adsorption process. We believe that this additional
phenomenon is the displacement of ethanol upon adsorption of the insulin,
and we have shown that a model including ethanol displacement is in
good agreement with the experimental data, both within the linear
range and at high-protein loads.
