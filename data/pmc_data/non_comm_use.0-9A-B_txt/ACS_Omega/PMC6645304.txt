Here,
we report the
development of catalysts comprising highly dispersed Au on an alumina
(Al2O3) support for the oxidation of glycerol
to high-value carboxylic acids in a liquid-phase flow reactor. The
catalysts were prepared by means of a deposition–precipitation
method. To ensure that the catalysts could be used for long-term catalytic
conversions in a liquid-phase flow reactor, we chose an alumina support
with high temperature stability and a particle size (50–200
μm) large enough to prevent leakage of the catalyst from the
reactor. One of the five catalysts had a high catalytic activity for
the conversion of glycerol to the high-value carboxylic acids, glyceric
acid and tartronic acid (conversion of glycerol >70%), and the
catalyst retained its catalytic activity over long-term use (up to
1770 min). Pretreatment of the catalyst with fructose, a mild reductant,
increased the activity of the catalyst. Scanning transmission electron
microscopy revealed three Au species highly dispersed on the surface
of the alumina support—Au nanoparticles (mode = 7.5–10
nm), Au clusters (1–2 nm), and atomic Au.

==== Body
Introduction
Since the discovery
of
the catalytic properties of Au,1 many Au-based
catalysts for the conversion of many types of molecules have been
developed. Also, catalytic conversions of lignocellulose2 and vegetable oil3 using both heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts have been widely
studied for the suppression of increasing of CO2 in the
atmosphere, recently. Glycerol is a major byproduct (10% of the raw
material) of the conversion of vegetable oil to biodiesel. To find
uses for this major byproduct, Pagliaro et al. summarized the conversion
of glycerol into high-value molecules4 and
Dumeignil et al. examined the selective oxidation of glycerol.5 The oxidation of glycerol using molecular oxygen
as an oxidant is an effective means of converting glycerol into high-value
carboxylic acids such as glyceric acid, which is used as an additive
in ink and as a cell activator, and tartronic acid, which is used
as an auxiliary agent in detergents and moisturizers.

Many research
groups have examined the use of noble-metal catalysts for the production
of carboxylic acids from glycerol, and conventional batch-type reactors
were used in most of previous studies. Kimura’s group pioneered
the research into glycerol oxidation, reporting the use of modified
noble-metal catalysts (mainly Pt- or Pd-modified Bi catalysts) and
either batch or fixed-bed flow reactors to oxidize glycerol to tartronic
acid6 and dihydroxyacetone (DHA).7,8 The Kimura’s research report8 is
one of the few examples of liquid phase of flow oxidation of glycerol.
Many other groups have also examined the catalytic activities of Pt-based
catalysts for the oxidation of glycerol.9 In addition to Pt and Pd, nanosized Au has also been shown to have
high catalytic activity for the oxidation of glycerol when molecular
oxygen is used as an oxidant. For example, Hutchings’ group
reported supported Au-based monometallic and bimetallic catalysts
prepared by means of both an impregnation method and a sol immobilization
method,10 and Villa and Prati’s
group (or the research groups related to them) reported detailed characterizations
and the catalytic activities of Au-based bimetallic and monometallic
catalysts.11 It is not an overstatement
that this research frame has been developed through the investigations
under a conventional batch reaction. Flow-type reaction technique
instead of batch type has been expected for conversion of large amount
of raw materials such as biomass-derived reactants.

Dumeignil’s
group, including the main author of this letter, has also reported
Au–Pd bimetallic catalysts prepared by means of ion-exchange12 and deposition–precipitation (DP) methods.13 Especially, the investigation of Au–Pd
in an ion-exchange resin support focused on the development of a suitable
catalyst for not only a batch reactor but also a flow reactor considering
the characteristics of a flow reactor, including mechanical devices
of a reaction system. This research report is also one of the few
examples of flow oxidation of glycerol. It has been reported that
ion-exchange resin is particularly suitable as a catalyst support
for reactions conducted in liquid-phase flow reactors, which have
recently attracted attention because of their greater efficiency compared
with batch reactors.14 A continuous catalytic
reaction (over 4000 min) in a liquid-phase flow reactor was successfully
conducted using a Au–Pd/anion-exchange resin catalyst (glycerol
conversion, 50–65%). However, since ion-exchange resin is unstable
at high temperatures (>333 K), the reaction rate could not be increased
by increasing the reaction temperature. Titanium dioxide is another
suitable support material for Au catalysts; however, it cannot be
used in liquid-phase flow reactors because its small particle size
means that particles can leak from the reaction tube and damage parts
of the mechanical devices of the reactor.

In this letter, we
present a study in which we developed high-performance catalysts for
the liquid-phase flow oxidation of glycerol to the high-value carboxylic
acids such as glyceric acid and tartronic acid. The typical merits
of using a flow reactor are high production efficiency and safer operation.
As we described above, there are only a few reports11d,15 about the catalytic performance of glyceric acid and tartronic acid
production using a flow reactor. Thus, we examined to prepare suitable
catalysts for liquid-phase flow operation. The catalysts were prepared
using a deposition–precipitation method to disperse nanosized
Au on an alumina support. To ensure that the oxidation reaction could
be conducted in a liquid-phase flow reactor instead of a conventional
batch-type reactor, we selected a commercially available activated
alumina powder that is commonly used for column chromatography (material:
alumina N; activity: I; specific surface area: 150 m2/g;
particle size: 50–200 μm; MP Biomedicals, Inc., California).
This alumina has high heat-resistance, so higher reaction temperatures
can be used, which provides a higher reaction rate and allows the
use of a compact reaction system. In addition, the particle size ensures
that there is no leakage of catalyst particles from the reactor through
the filter and there is sufficient contact among the catalyst, reactant,
and oxidant.

Results and Discussion
Table 1 shows the
Au content of the catalysts, as determined by inductively coupled
plasma (ICP) optical emission spectroscopy, and the pH of the Au solution
before and after deposition–precipitation (DP). Not all of
the gold precursor was completely deposited on the surface of the
alumina support, and we found that when a high pH was used, less Au
was deposited compared to when a low pH was used; therefore, preparing
the catalysts at a lower pH prevented the loss of Au. In the case
of DP process, controlling the pHs is a very important factor in the
preparation of better catalysts. The gold species are dispersed over
the surface of the support by the electric affinity between the Au
complexes and the surface of the support materials. After the pH adjustment,
the electric charge of Au complexes, such as Au(OH)n, is negative in the aqueous solution. In our case, the
electric affinities (interactions) were not so strong for fixing enough
Au precursor in the higher pH conditions (4.6–7.0). Thus, the
amounts of gold (catalysts 1–3) were lower than that of catalyst
4. The ICP analysis indicated the suitable pH for a DP process for
the support material.

Table 2 shows the
results of continuous catalytic oxidation
of glycerol using the prepared catalysts and a flow reactor. The behaviors
in the time on stream are discussed in the next paragraph. The major
products obtained were glyceric acid and tartronic acid. Of the five
catalysts examined, at both 343 and 358 K, catalysts 3 and 4 indicated
good performances for glycerol conversions. Comparing these two catalysts,
catalyst 4 converted less glycerol but produced higher amounts of
glyceric acid and tartronic acid than did catalyst 3. We therefore
chose catalyst 4 for use in the subsequent experiments. No leakage
of catalyst from the reaction chamber was observed during any of the
reaction periods. Here, catalyst 1 also indicated good conversion,
similar to that of the catalyst 4. The phenomena suggested formation
of high-performance active sites, whose details are not clear now,
on the support. However, according to ICP analysis, the amount of
gold (as a rare noble metal) precursor lost in DP process was mostly
among the tested catalysts. Thus, we considered that the preparation
parameter (pH) was inappropriate.

Figure 1 shows the catalytic performance of catalyst
4 with respect to the amount of glycerol converted and the amount
of each carboxylic acid produced. This experiment was conducted continuously
for a total of 690 min at four temperatures (343, 358, 353, and 343
K), with the initial temperature being repeated to examine whether
the catalyst had an induction period. A pause for measurement was
included at 360 min. We found that the catalytic activity of the second
reaction at 343 K (570–690 min) was superior to that of the
first reaction at 343 K (30–150 min), indicating that the catalyst
had an induction period. The products detected by means of high-performance
liquid chromatography were assigned to reasonable ingredients. Considering
the product distribution, we concluded that the reaction pathway for
this catalyst was comparable with that reported previously for glycerol
oxidation using Au-based catalysts.

4 at various temperatures. (a) Conversion of glycerol, (b) selectivities
for products. Reactant solutions: 0.6 mol/L glycerol, 2.4 mol/L NaOH
(glycerol/NaOH = 1:4 (mol/mol)); flow rate of the reactant: 0.25 mL/min;
flow rate of oxygen: 6.0 mL/min; catalyst weight: 0.5 g.

Scheme 1 shows the reaction pathway for the conversion
of glycerol into carboxylic acids using Au catalysts and batch reactors,
as compiled on the basis of previously reported results from several
research groups.13,16 The scheme suggests that the
present catalysts pushed the equilibrium between glyceraldehyde and
dihydroxyacetone to favor glyceraldehyde rather than dihydroxyacetone,
which resulted in the formation of glyceric acid rather than lactic
acid. In our previous study using a Au(−Pd)/TiO2 catalyst and a batch reactor, dihydroxyacetone was not detected.
In contrast, dihydroxyacetone was detected as one of products in the
present study, albeit in low amounts. Because of the short residence
time in the catalyst bed, dihydroxyacetone (DHA) and glyceraldehyde
did not reach equilibrium state. (Given sufficient time, DHA is converted
into glyceric acid via glyceraldehyde, as reported previously, which
is a competition between lactic acid production and glyceric acid
production.) DHA is also a high-value molecule for sunless-tanning
cosmetics. If DHA is also included into target molecules of the oxidation,
the total selectivities (glyceric acid, tartronic acid, and DHA, which
are three-carbon molecules without cleavage of C–C bond in
glycerol) reach about 80% in our case (see Figure 2).

Pathway for the Conversion of Glycerol into Carboxylic Acids Using

This
scheme was prepared from results
reported by several
research groups. Bold and underlined molecules are the products detected
in the present study by means of high-performance liquid chromatography.

Figure 2 shows the long-term (total time, 1650 min)
performance of catalyst 4 at 343 K. In this experiment, we used 5
times the weight of the catalyst that was used in the previous experiment
so that higher product yields would be obtained. Again, an induction
period was observed, and no deactivation of the catalyst was observed
at any point during the reaction period. The selectivity (44.6%) of
tartronic acid, which is also a high-value chemical, at 1650 min is
higher than that of typical results using a batch-type reactor.17 This is one of the superior points of this research.
The time course of carbon balance is shown in the Supporting Information
(Figure S2a). The average of the carbon
balance from the first analysis point to the end is 95.0%. The amount
reduced without reaching 100% is presumed to be CO2 formation
(gaseous CO2 or sodium carbonate in aqueous solution) by
complete oxidation, except for the error in quantitative analysis.

We considered the induction period to reflect the reduction of
Au to a metallic state by glycerol and the oxidation products. Therefore,
we next examined what effect pretreatment with fructose, an organic
reductant, would have on the performance of catalyst 4 at 343 K (Figure 3; see the Supporting Information for experimental details).
With fructose pretreatment, the initial activity of the catalyst (conversion
= 60%) was higher than that without pretreatment (conversion = 50%).
In addition, the conversion of glycerol reached over 70% in less time
(200 min) than without pretreatment (600 min). The highest conversion
obtained with pretreatment was more than 80%. These results confirmed
that reduction of Au was one of the reasons for the induction period
observed in the earlier experiment (Figures 1 and 2).

Figure 3 Effects of
fructose pretreatment
and the removal of NaOH from the reactant on the performance of catalyst
4. (a) Conversion of glycerol, (b) selectivities for products. Reactant
solutions: 0.6 mol/L glycerol, 2.4 mol/L NaOH (glycerol/NaOH = 1:4
(mol/mol)); flow rate of the reactant: 0.25 mL/min; flow rate of oxygen:
6.0 mL/min; catalyst weight: 2.5 g; temperature: 343 K.

Next,
we examined the effect of NaOH, an alkaline additive, on the reactant
by not including NaOH in the reactant between 1110 and 1410 min (Figure 3). Removal of NaOH
from the reactant produced a marked deactivation of the catalyst,
which was recovered after the reintroduction of NaOH into the reactant.
This confirmed that NaOH in the reactant solution was essential for
the conversion of glycerol to carboxylic acids, as has been reported
by several groups.11d,18 The average turn-over frequency
(TOF) between 1470 and 1770 min was 67.5 h–1. (The
equation for calculation of TOF is shown in the Supporting Information.) The improvement in the TOF compared
with that reported from our previous study12 (34.1 h–1) was likely a result of the higher operation
temperature used in the present study, which was achievable because
of the high heat-resistance of the alumina we selected as the support
material. The carbon balance of this experiment is also shown in the
Supporting Information (Figure S2b). The
average carbon balance of the steady state (except the data from 1110
to 1410 min) is 94.7% in this case.

Finally, we used scanning
transmission electron microscopy to examine the surface morphology
of catalyst 4 immediately after calcination (Figure 4). In
the lower-magnification image (Figure 4a), several Au nanoparticles (mode = 7.5–10
nm (45.8% of counted nanoparticles)) can be seen. Size range of 96.6%
of nanoparticles is 2.5–2.5 nm. The histogram is shown in the
Supporting Information (Figure S3a). In
the higher-magnification image (Figure 4b), highly dispersed atomic Au and small Au clusters
(1–2 nm) can be seen. In the measured square field of Figure 4b (19.8 nm ×
19.8 nm), there are about 35 atomic gold and 1 clusterlike gold species.
Similar atomic and clusterlike Au species on the surface of an alumina
support (or an Fe-modified alumina support) in catalysts developed
for the hydrogenation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural to afford 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan
were previously reported by Satsuma et al.;19 in addition, atomic Au species have been reported to be inactive
or less catalytically active than the clusterlike species with respect
to their hydrogenation activity. Details of the catalytic activities
of the three Au species observed in the present study remain to be
elucidated. We are now advancing analysis to elucidate the gold nanospecies.

Conclusions
We prepared five high-performance
Au/alumina catalysts by means of a deposition–precipitation
method for the conversion of glycerol to high-value carboxylic acids.
The reaction was conducted in a liquid-phase flow reactor, which was
made possible by careful selection of a suitable alumina support material.
The catalysts were prepared under different pH conditions, which resulted
in the deposition of varying amounts of Au on the alumina support.
After the activities of the catalysts were examined, the most active
catalyst was selected and further characterized. We found that this
catalyst could be used for long-term (up to 1770 min) conversion of
glycerol into glyceric acid and tartronic acid. The TOFs for this
catalyst were higher than those we reported previously. We also found
that the catalyst had an induction period, which we considered to
be due to the reduction of the Au in the catalyst to a suitable state
for oxidation. No deactivation of the catalyst was observed during
the long-term test. Finally, scanning transmission electron microscopy
revealed three highly dispersed Au species on the surface of the alumina
support—atomic Au, Au nanoparticles, and Au clusters.

Experimental
Section
We prepared five
Au/Al2O3 catalysts by means of the deposition–precipitation
method established by Haruta et al.20 Briefly,
an acidic Au solution was prepared and adjusted to the required pH
by addition of NaOH. Powdered support material was then added to the
solution, the mixture was stirred for 2 h at 343 K, and the catalyst
precursor was washed several times with distilled water and filtered.
The obtained catalyst powder was dried at room temperature overnight
and then calcined at 673 K for 4 h. Catalytic reaction tests were
conducted using a stainless-steel liquid-phase flow reactor (inside
diameter = 9.4 mm, length = 50 mm; Eyela, Tokyo, Japan) with Teflon
filters at the inlet and outlet of the reaction chamber. The reaction
chamber was filled with the catalyst and then heated using an electric
aluminum-block heater. Products were identified by means of high-performance
liquid chromatography (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Calibration curves
for quantitative measurements were prepared using commercial reagents
of high purity. The Au content of the catalysts was determined by
means of inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy.
A scanning transmission electron microscope (ARM-200F; JEOL, Tokyo,
Japan) was used to examine the surface morphology of the catalysts.
Details of the experiments are described in the Supporting Information.
