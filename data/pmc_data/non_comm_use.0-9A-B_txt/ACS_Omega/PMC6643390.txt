For a given size of one fullerene molecule, there could exist many different isomers
and their energy landscape is remarkably complex. To have a better
understanding of the nature and origin of their isomeric stability,
as a continuation of our previous endeavors, we systematically dissect
the molecular stability of four fullerene systems, C44,
C48, C52, and C60, with a total of
2547 structures, using density functional theory and the information-theoretic
approach. The total energy decomposition analysis is beneficial to
understand the origin and nature of isomeric stability. Our results
showcase that the electrostatic potential is the dominant factor contributing
to the isomeric stability of these fullerenes, and other contributions
such as steric and quantum effects play minor but indispensable roles.
This study also finds that the origin of the isomeric stability of
these species is due to the spatial delocalization of the electron
density. Our work should provide novel insights into the isomeric
stability of fullerene molecules, which have found tremendous applications
in solar-energy studies and nanomaterial sciences.

1 Introduction
Since
their first theoretical prediction in 1970,1 and then experimental verification in 1985,2 fullerenes have served as the starting point of numerous
studies for a wide variety of other carbon structures,3,4 among which are carbon nanotubes,5 graphene,6,7 carbon nanodots,8 schwarzites,9 and carbon nanocombs.10 Nowadays, carbon nanomaterials are promising for many applications,
such as electrical energy storage, photoconversion, biological imaging,
gas storage and separation, or nanomedical therapy.10−14

Yet, what dictates the origin of the isomeric
stability of fullerenes
is still an unresolved and ongoing research task. For example, why
does the most stable isomer of C60 possess the Ih symmetry? Previously, both steric hindrance
and hyperconjugation effects have been employed to study the origin
and nature of isomeric stability. However, even for ethane, no consensus
is available on which of these effects is more significant.15−21 Recently, we tackled the issue in a different manner in terms of
physiochemical insights such as steric effect.22 In addition, several external factors might influence the
molecular stability of the different isomers of fullerenes. For instance,
some nonstable isomers are stabilized when some molecular fragments
are included in the cavity.23

In
this work, we employ two different energy decomposition schemes
from density functional reactivity theory (DFRT),22 to distinguish the core factors dominating the relative
isomeric stability of fullerenes (C44, C48,
C52, and C60) as shown in Figure 1. Our results reveal that the electrostatic
potential plays a key role whereas the exchange–correlation
contribution and steric hindrance play minor roles in determining
the relative isomeric stability. In addition, some commonly used density-based
quantities from the information-theoretic approach (ITA), such as
Shannon entropy, Fisher information, Onicescu information energy,
and Ghosh–Berkowitz–Parr (GBP) entropy, are also employed
to gain insights into their relative stability. Our results show that
there exists a strong linear relationship between the total energy
difference and the Shannon entropy difference among isomers.

The remaining part of this article is ordered in the following
manner. In Section 2, the main results and discussion are presented, followed by the
Concluding Remarks to summarize the main findings in Section 3. In Section 4, the two energy decomposition schemes are
outlined, followed by the introduction of a few well-known information-theoretic
quantities. Computational details are provided Section 5.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Total Energy and Its Components
One
basic question we aim to answer in this work is whether there is an
energetic component that is responsible for the isomeric stability
of fullerene buckyballs. Figure 2 shows strong linear correlations between the total
energy difference ΔE and its components: electrostatic
interaction ΔEe (Figure 2a) and exchange–correlation
ΔExc (Figure 2b). The corresponding correlation coefficients R2 are larger than 0.99, indicating that electrostatic
and exchange–correlation interactions both positively contribute
to the relative stability of fullerene conformers.

Figure 2 Strong linear relationships
between the total energy difference
(ΔE) and its components: (a) ΔE = 0.626ΔEe + 0.004;
(b) ΔE = 0.626ΔExc – 0.004.

In addition, a strong linear relationship is observed between
ΔExc and ΔEe (results not shown). Its implication is straightforward
that electrostatic
effects may be made use of in constructing better exchange–correlation
energy functionals. This idea was first proposed by Fermi and Amaldi
in 1934.24 Furthermore, we aim to answer
the following question: Are the two energy components equivalently
important? To further pin down this point, we employ a binary fit
strategy. Figure 3 displays
the strong linear regression equations between the total energy difference
ΔE and its two-component fitting results 1  and 2  It is unambiguous that from eqs 1 and 2 that
electrostatic potential is the predominant energy component as showcased
by the coefficients. In conventional Kohn–Sham density functional
theory (KS-DFT) scheme, both Ee and Exc make positive contributions to the total
energy difference in a synchronous way as shown in eq 1. However, in eq 2, compared with that from Ee, the contribution from the steric effect, Es, makes negative contributions to the relative stability
of fullerene buckyballs.

Figure 3 Strong linear relationships between the total
energy difference
and its components for C44, C48, C52, and C60 under study.

Taken together, we have verified that electrostatic potential
plays
a key role in determining the relative isomeric stability of fullerene
buckyballs. In the meantime, exchange–correlation potential
plays a minor role. Moreover, the impact resulted from the steric
effect is minimal.

2.2 Total Energy and Information
Quantities
Figure 4 shows the
strong linear relationship between the total energy difference ΔE and the Shannon entropy difference ΔSS with the correlation coefficient R2 equal to 0.983. ITA quantities have their own physical meaning
and gauge different aspects of the electronic properties as shown
in eqs 8–15. Although there is no significantly strong correlation
between ΔE and many of the ITA quantities (as
shown in Table S1), shown in Figure 4, the strong linear correlation
between the total energy difference (ΔE) and
the Shannon entropy ΔSS suggests
that spatial delocalization of the electron density gauged by the
Shannon entropy is the origin of the isomeric stability of these fullerene
molecules. This result provides us a novel insight into this complicated
phenomenon of isomeric stability from the perspective of information
theory. As a piece of evidence to support this point, Figure S1 shows the reasonable correlation between
the total energy difference (ΔE) and the Rydberg
non-Lewis contribution from natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis at
the M06-2X/Def2-TZVP level of theory for all of the isomers of C44, C48, and C52 fullerenes. The Rydberg
non-Lewis contribution from NBO analysis is a measure of the deviation
from the traditional Lewis structure and thus could be used as a gauge
of the electron delocalization.

total energy difference (ΔE) and the Shannon
entropy difference (ΔSS).

2.3 Correlations
among ITA and Energetic Quantities
It is well known that
ITA and energetic quantities can be strongly
intercorrelated.25 These different but
strongly correlated relationships provide effective measurements about
the electron density distribution of the system; thus, they attribute
useful and novel insights into the nature and origin of various physicochemical
phenomena including the isomeric stability of different fullerene
buckyballs. As an illustrative example, Figure 5 exhibits two strong linear correlations
of the relative Rényi entropy of order 2 with two other ITA
quantities for all of the conformers of C44, C48, C52, and C60 studied in this work. As can
be seen from the figure, Rr2 is positively correlated with Rr3 and IG, each with R2 > 0.95. On the other hand, Table 1 shows the correlation coefficient (R) between the total energy difference and five components.
Besides the strong correlation of ΔE with ΔEe and ΔExc, we also found that there exists a strong linear correlation between
ΔEe and ΔExc, which is unique in these systems.

for C44, C48, C52, and C60 studied in this work.

3 Concluding Remarks
In summary, using two different total energy partition schemes
from density functional theory together with the quantities from the
information-theoretic approach, in this work, we tackle the issue
of how to pin down the nature and origin of the isomeric stability
of fullerene molecules. Through the calculations and analyses of the
four fullerene systems, C44, C48, C52, and C60 with a total of 2547 isomeric structures, we
found that the electrostatic interaction is the single largest contributor
to the isomeric stability of these fullerene species. This result
is consistent with our earlier results from other systems. Also, other
energetic components such as steric effect and exchange–correlation
interaction play a minor but indispensable role in determining the
isomeric stability of these compounds. Finally, the strong linear
correlation between the total energy difference and the Shannon entropy
difference indicates that the isomeric stability is dictated by the
delocalization of the electron density in these fullerene systems.
We mention in passing that the question whether a maximum entropy
principle can complement the usual minimum energy principle of stability
deserves our further attention. It is still an open question, and
its universality should be amenable to more systematic studies in
future. This is what we do, and its results will be presented elsewhere.

4 Methodology
4.1 Energy Decomposition Schemes
in DFT
In Kohn–Sham DFT,21 the total energy
of a given molecular system is formulated as 3  where Ts, Ee, and Exc are the
noninteracting kinetic, electrostatic, and exchange–correlation
energies, respectively. The electrostatic energy Ee includes three independent components: the nuclear–electron
attraction, Vne; the classical interelectron
Coulombic repulsion, J; and the nuclear–nuclear
repulsion, Vnn. The last term Exc consists of exchange (Ex) and correlation (Ec) components.

Recently, to evaluate the steric effect within DFT, one of us has
proposed a novel total energy decomposition scheme 4  where Ee is the
same electrostatic energy in eq 3, Es stands for the steric effect,
and Eq signifies the contribution originating
from Fermionic quantum effect (due to the exchange–correlation
interaction). In eq 4, the energy component associated with the steric effect Es has been proved to be simply the Weizsäcker
kinetic energy 5  where ρ(r) and ∇ρ(r) are the electron density and its gradient, respectively.
After combining eqs 3 and 4, one has the definition of Eq 6  This new formulation has its own distinct
physical meaning with a corresponding physical state.22 It has been applied to a number of molecular systems and
phenomena,22,26−34 whose results are consistent with our chemical intuition and conventional
wisdom.

4.2 Information-Theoretic Quantities in DFT
Shannon entropy SS is a measure of
the spatial delocalization of the electron density, and Fisher information IF measures the sharpness or localization of
the same. They are defined as eqs 7 and 8, respectively 7   8  Earlier, we have
proven35 that for atoms and molecules, IF has an equivalent expression (eq 9) in terms of the Laplacian of the
electron density,
∇2ρ(r) 9  Ghosh–Berkowitz–Parr
(GBP) entropy SGBP(36) 10  where t(r; ρ)
is the kinetic energy density, which is related to the total kinetic
energy Ts via 11  tTF(r; ρ) is the Thomas–Fermi
kinetic energy density given
by 12  with K as the Boltzmann constant
(set to be unity for convenience in this work), c = (5/3) + ln(4πcK/3), and cK = (3/10)(3π2)2/3, the specific form of the local kinetic energy .

More recently, additional ITA quantities
have been introduced as new reactivity descriptors in DFRT. One example
is Onicescu information energy of order n 13  relative Rényi
entropy of order n 14  and information gain (also called
Kullback–Leibler
divergence) IG is given in eq 15 15  where ρ0(r)
is the reference-state density satisfying the same normalization condition
as ρ(r).

5 Computational
Details
For C44, C48, and C52 fullerenes,
there are a total of 89, 199, and 437 isomers, respectively. All of
these conformers were fully optimized at the PBE(D3)/Def2-TZVP37−39 level of theory without any symmetry constraint to allow them to
be fully and completely optimized. All of the coordinates optimized
from this work can be found in the Supporting Information. A single-point frequency calculation was performed
to ensure that the final structure obtained has no imaginary frequency.
In this work, only all of the isomers of C44 were considered
to make the computations tractable. For C60, which has
1812 isomers, the previously optimized coordinates at the same theoretical
level were directly taken from ref (40) without further optimization and subsequent
frequency calculations. All DFT calculations were carried out using
the Gaussian 0941 package version D01 with
tight self-consistent field convergence criteria and ultrafine integration
grids to rule out numerical instabilities. The molecular wave functions
were obtained at the M06-2X/Def2-TZVP42,43 level as well
as the energetic components as obtained with the Gaussian keyword
IOp(5/33 = 1). All ITA quantities mentioned above were evaluated using
the Multiwfn 3.3.9 program,44 with the
Gaussian checkpoint file as the input file. The steric energy component
was obtained via Fisher information, which differs from the Weizsäcker
kinetic energy by a factor of 8. In addition, we have taken the isomer
with the lowest energy as a reference for each series of C44, C48, C52, and C60. Accordingly,
the total energy difference should always be positive. Put all together,
we have a total of 2547 structures for these 4 fullerene systems.
When plotting a correlation, we put all these 2547 data points together,
indicating that the relationships should be universal to all of these
species.
