Materials possessing electron spin can shorten the T1 relaxation times in magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI).
For example, gadolinium (Gd) complexes with seven f-orbital electrons
are widely used as contrast agents in clinical applications. However,
Gd has severe potential side effects, and thus metal-free alternatives
are needed. Toward this end, we synthesized seven NO radicals consisting
of a dioxa-azaspiro[4.5]decane framework having various substituents, DAD-X (X = methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, c-propyl, vinyl, phenyl, and 2-pyridyl), that functioned
as metal-free MRI contrast agents. The relationship between (i) water–proton
relaxivity and log P and (ii) reactivity for
ascorbic acid and the spin density of the NO oxygen atom were established,
which provided a basis for the rational design of practical metal-free
contrast agents.

1 Introduction
As gadolinium (Gd) features
the highest possible spin quantum number
(S) of 7/2, Gd complexes such as Magnevist and Omniscan
are widely used as T1-weighted contrast
agents (CAs) for clinical-purpose magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).1 However, these agents can induce renal disorders,
accumulate in the brain, etc.,2 which highlights
the need for alternative contrast agents.3 Organic radicals possess S = 1/2 and can therefore
be employed as metal-free MRI contrast agents; however, the small
value of S results in a much lower ability as the
contrast agent than that of Gd complexes.4 To address this problem, a dendrimer comprising numerous NO radicals
was constructed as a metal-free contrast agent and showed a high ability
as the contrast agent and elevated biostability.5

Previously, we reported a series of NO radical-containing
self-assembled
urea benzene derivatives (UBDs)6−9 as metal-free contrast agents,
revealing that these supra-molecules show higher ability as the contrast
agents than (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl (TEMPO) because of the restricted molecular motion in the NO part (Scheme S1). The ability of Gd complexes is well
predicted by the Lipari–Szabo model,10 their abilities depend on the following significant factors; (1)
electron relaxation (τιe) of the spin source,
(2) rotational correlation time (τR) of the spin
source, (3) diffusion rate of water (τm) around the
spin source, and (4) the number of water molecules binding to the
Gd ion (q). However, for organic radicals, systematical
experiments and concepts based on the corresponding results are currently
missing. In the case of metal-free contrast agents, water molecules
around the NO moiety and their orientation are believed to be of significance
for ability enhancement as the contrast agents. Furthermore, resistance
toward reductants such as ascorbic acid (AsA) is important for the
construction of practical contrast agents. Finally, no systematic
experimental assessment of contrast agent reactivity has been performed
yet. To understand the fundamental relationship between the presence
of water molecules and contrast agent polarity and that between the
reactivity for AsA and spin density at NO, we synthesized seven NO
radicals with substituents of various hydrophobicity around the NO
group (Scheme 1), DAD-X (DAD = dioxa-azaspiro[4.5]decane, X = methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, c-propyl, vinyl, phenyl, 2-pyridyl), and evaluated their abilities
as contrast agents. Seven DAD-X are abbreviated as 1(Me), 2(Et), 3(nP), 4(cP), 5(Vin), 6(Ph), and 7(Py) for X = methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, c-propyl, vinyl, phenyl, and 2-pyridyl, respectively. These
species were classified into three groups, namely, those bearing substituents
without π-orbitals (methyl, ethyl, and n-propyl),
with π-orbitals (vinyl, phenyl, and pyridyl), and with a pseudo-π-orbital
(c-propyl).10 Despite
being strained, the cyclopropyl ring is not labile under ambient conditions
because of the presence of Walsh orbitals with symmetric and antisymmetric
components.11 Herein, we describe the physical
properties of DAD-X, e.g., log P and water–proton relaxivity (r1, a measure of ability as the contrast agent), evaluate the reactivity
(k2) of these species for AsA, and establish r1−log P and k2−spin density at NO correlations. In
particular, we focused on the log P value
as an essential physical parameter. The log P values denote hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity for molecules based
on their substituents, therefore, larger and smaller log P values indicate more hydrophobic and more hydrophilic
compounds, respectively. If the molecules possess substituents based
on smaller log P, a lot of water molecules,
which have polarity, might gather around the corresponding hydrophilic
molecules. Accordingly, in the case of DAD-X carrying
hydrophilic groups, the water molecules gather around the NO group,
then the ability as contrast agents are expected to vary. Preparing
various substituted-DAD-X, we will herein discuss the
abilities as contrast agents based on various log P values.

Scheme 1 Molecular Structures of Seven DAD-X Compounds
2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Syntheses
DAD-X were
prepared as illustrated in Scheme 2. In the presence of an organic acid, 2-bromo-2-nitro-1,3-propanediol
and 2,2-dimethoxypropane were condensed to afford the cyclic acetal
compound (8), and then bromine was removed via reduction
using NaBH4, to afford (9). Next, a Michael
addition using the given nitro compound and methyl vinyl ketone in
the presence of an organic base was performed to produce (10), and then a reduction using zinc powder was carried out to afford
a parent nitron compound (11). Finally, the substituents
were introduced into nitrone compounds via similar Grignard reactions.
The resulting DAD-X were determined their molecular structures
and purities by various spectrometries. Due to the paramagnetic effects
of DAD-X, the corresponding hydroxylamine derivatives,
which were products by a reduction reaction using ascorbic acid or
phenylhydrazine toward DAD-X, were used to conduct NMR
spectra (1H and 13C) (Figures S17–S23).

2.2 Physical Properties
The presence
of the NO radical moiety was confirmed by UV–visible (vis)
(Figure S1), electron spin resonance (ESR, Figure S2), and IR spectroscopies (Figure S3). X-band (9.4 GHz) ESR spectra featured
three typical lines with aN = 1.37 mT
at g = 2.0006 1  According to the Kivelson equation (eq 1; Table S1),12 τR values,
which are able to represent the molecular motion, were smaller than
those of UBD species (5.0–9.5 × 10–11 s), which formed nanoparticles in aqueous solution. Thus, DAD-X compounds were concluded to be present in the monomeric
form, which allowed us to exclude self-assembly effects (Scheme S1) for an evaluation of the contrast
agents and directly evaluate substituent effects. The stability checks
of DAD-X in water solutions were performed by changes
of ESR signal intensities. The double integration value of the ESR
signal in 1 mM solution was monitored at 23 °C until 82 h. The
values were gradually decayed, and after 82 h, the initial values
reduced by 85–99%. These results indicated that no positive
chemical reaction proceeded even surrounding many water molecules,
and the stability of DAD-X was sufficient to perform
various examinations such as an MRI, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and
a stability check toward an ascorbic acid solution (Figure S4).

For the evaluation of contrast agents, T1-weighted images were acquired at different
contrast agent concentrations by a 1.5 T MRI apparatus [Figure 1a for 4(cP) and Figure S5-1 for all of the remaining DAD-X]. With the increasing DAD-X concentration, the image
color shifted toward the blue region, i.e., the relaxation time concomitantly
decreased. The obtained relaxation rates (inverse of T1) were plotted against the contrast agent concentration
[Figure 1b for 4(cP) and Figure S5-2 for all of
the remaining DAD-X], and the plots were fitted by a
least-squares method. r1 values (Table 1) were estimated from
the slope of these plots, with the highest and lowest values obtained
for 1(Me) and 6(Ph), respectively.

As NO radicals easily react with various reductants
such as AsA
and glutathione, the potential reactivity for such reductants can
be used to directly evaluate the metabolic stabilities of DAD-X.13 To determine this reactivity, we estimated
the second-order reaction rate constants k2 by the Ostwald method.14 The decay of
the DAD-X (10 μM) ESR signal in the presence of
various concentrations of AsA (1–30 mM) was tracked for 2000
s, with decay curves obtained for 5 or 10 mM AsA shown in Figure S6. The curves obtained for individual
concentrations in the region of 0–400 s were fitted by a least-squares
method using eq 2 to
afford the pseudo k1 rate constant, namely, kobs. The values of kobs estimated for various concentrations were plotted vs AsA concentration
[Figure 2 for 3(nP) and 4(cP), and Figures S6–S8 for the remaining DAD-X], and the
slope of these plots gave k2 (eq 3) 2   3  The thus obtained k2 values decreased in the order of 5(Vin) > 7(Py) > 6(Ph) > 1(Me) > 4(cP) > 2(Et) > 3(nP), i.e.,
compounds with π-orbitals
(including pseudo-π) featured obviously larger k2 values than those without π-orbitals (Table 1). It is worth noting
that the reactivities of DAD-X were comparable or much
lower than one of TEMPO derivatives (Figure S9),15 therefore, the DAD-X might prolong the function as MRI CA for in vivo examination.

Plots of the resulting kobs values vs

One-electron reduction or oxidation of NO radicals
affords labile
anions (NO–) or cations (+N=O),
respectively (Scheme 3). Thus, redox potentials were estimated by cyclic voltammetry (CV)
measurements as indices of resistance to reduction and oxidation.
The absolute oxidation potentials were similar to each other, whereas
the reduction potentials decreased in the order of 1(Me) > 5(Vin) > 4(cP) ≈ −2(Et) > 7(Py) > 3(nP) > 6(Ph),
which was different from the order of estimated k2 values (Table S2 and Figure S9).

Scheme 3 Reversible One-Electron Oxidation and Reduction Reactions of
NO Radicals
To find potential correlations of r1, k2, and reduction potential
with the
substitution pattern of DAD-X, we estimated parameters
such as log P, spin density at NO by density
functional theory (DFT) calculations.16 In particular, the log P value is predicted
to work as an essential parameter among the metal-free contrast agents
(vide supra). Due to the formation of emulsion, the calculated log P values were used as the valid one. In addition, free space
around NO was estimated as the percent buried volume (%Vbur) and free volume (%Vfree), using the SambVca 2.0 web tool,17 and
the values of diamagnetic susceptibility (χD) as Pascal’s constant were taken from a previous
report.18 The optimized structures are
shown in Figure S10, and the estimated
parameters are summarized in Table 1 for estimated volume percentage and Table S3 for solvation Gibbs free energies. DAD-X with longer alkyl chains featured higher log P values [3(nP) > 2(Et) > 1(Me)], and 6(Ph) possessed a higher value than −Py. As the NO radical resonates between the oxygen radical
(O•) and nitrogen cation radical (N+•) forms (Scheme 4),
the O•/N+• spin density ratio
(SDR) depends on the molecule and the environment. Interestingly,
the SDRs of DAD-X with π-orbitals exceeded those
of species without π-orbitals, i.e., spin density at oxygen
was higher in the former case (Table 1). This behavior was explained by the through-space
stabilization of O• by π-orbitals.

Scheme 4 Resonance
Structures of NO Radical
The estimated volume of free space (%Vfree) around NO (Table 1 and Figure S11) was independent of alkyl
chain length [1(Me), 2(Et), or 3(nP)] and number of carbon atoms [3(nP) vs 4(cP) and 5(Vin) vs 2(Et)]. The r2/r1 ratio was influenced
by overall magnetic susceptibility (χmeas),19 which is a sum of a paramagnetic
term (χP) and χD. Compared to those without π-orbitals, DAD-X with π-orbitals had a higher absolute χD, except for 5(Vin), which was ascribed
to the shielding effect of ring current in phenyl, pyridyl, and c-propyl rings.

2.3 Estimation of Ability as Contrast Agents
The obtained parameters were plotted against r1, as shown in Figure 3. In Figure 3a, r1 was relatively well correlated
with log P, especially in the case of alkyl
substituents. The above correlation was negative, which implied that
the hydrophobic groups kept water molecules away from the NO radicals,
i.e., displayed pseudo-dehydrated behavior. However, a deviation was
observed for DAD-X with π-orbitals. A good correlation
between r1 and χD or SDR was observed for alkyl-substituted compounds
(Figure 3b or c), while
no such correlation was observed in the case of DAD-X with π-orbitals. Therefore, r1 was plotted vs a new function (function 1 = log P + 0.009χD) accounting for log P and χD, and the resulting correlation
was better than those obtained using log P and χD as sole parameters (Figure 3d).

Figure 3 Plots of (a) r1 vs
log P, (b) r1 vs
Pascal’s
constant (χD), (c) r1 vs spin density ratio (SDR), (d) r1 vs function 1. Solid lines indicate least-squares fits obtained
using (a–c) alkyl analogue data and (d) all data. In (d), function
1 = log P + 0.009χD (see
text). The numerical number “0.009” in function 1 was
determined by the smallest R2 value according
to the least-squares fitting.

Figure 4 presents
the correlations between k2 and various
parameters. Figure 4a shows that reasonable negative correlations between k2 and log P were observed for
two groups of DAD-X (with and without π-orbitals),
which suggested that high hydrophilicity enhanced the ability of DAD-X to interact with the highly polar AsA. To explain the
fact that two separate correlations were observed for compounds with
and without π-orbitals, we plotted k2 as a function of SDR (Figure 4b), and again, two separate strong positive correlations were
observed. To support this behavior, we calculated SDR values for TEMPO(20) and PROXYL(21) as 0.8952 and 0.8266, respectively.
These values agreed with the higher reactivity of the former compound
for AsA,22 i.e., SDR was confirmed to be
positively correlated with reactivity for AsA.

Figure 4 Plots of (a) k2 vs log P, (b) k2 vs SDR, (c) k2 vs FrS, (d) k2 vs function 2. Solid
lines indicate least-squares fits obtained
for data including and excluding species with π-orbitals [(a)
and (b) respectively] and for all data (d). In (d), function 2 is
defined as SDR + 0.095(1/log P) (see the text).
The numerical number “0.095” in function 2 was determined
by the smallest R2 value according to
the least-squares fitting.

Moreover, the correlation between k2 and free space (%Vfree)
was taken into
account (Figure 4c),
as %Vfree can be influenced by substituents
in DAD-X and was expected to be positively correlated
with k2. However, no clear relationship
between %Vfree and k2 was revealed. Notably, TEMPO (%Vfree = 53.7) features a higher reactivity for AsA than PROXYL (%Vfree = 56.6) despite
featuring a smaller %Vfree (Figure 5). Thus, we concluded that
reactivity for AsA is dominantly controlled by SDR and not by %Vfree. Finally, we defined a new function, function
2, as SDR + 0.095 (1/log P) and showed that
this function was better correlated with k2 than the individual parameters of SDR and log P (Figure 4d).

models (top panels) and molecular structures with
coordinates (down panels) of TEMPO (left) and PROXYL (right). %Vbur indicates the percentage
of the buried spaces. The values of free space (%Vfree) were estimated according to 100 – %Vbur.

Surprisingly, the absolute value of reduction potential
decreased
with increasing hydrophobicity and decreasing SDR, which indicated
that the NO radical was mainly present as N+• when
reacting with e–. The N+• form
may be stabilized by electron-donating (e.g., alkyl) groups because
of their inductive effect. However, no correlation between reduction
potential and the σp parameter of the Hammett equation23 was observed (Figure S12).

3 Conclusions
Based on the above, we
concluded that metal-free contrast agents
need to possess high r1 and low reactivity
for AsA. As systematic investigations of NO radicals as contrast agents
have been missing, we prepared seven DAD-X with various
substituents on the NO-fused five-membered ring, revealing the strong
negative correlation between r1 and hydrophobicity
(represented by log P) (Figure 6). Furthermore, the reactivity for AsA (represented
by k2) was strongly positively correlated
with the spin density at oxygen (SDR), which was higher for DAD-X with π-orbitals. Interestingly, the correlations
observed for reduction potential were opposite to those observed for k2, which suggested that reduction by AsA dominantly
occurred at O•, whereas that by e– occurred at N+• (Figure 6). Furthermore, an acetal ring in the structure
of DAD-X is capable of deprotecting under acidic conditions,
to form a diol analogue, which is a hydrophilic compound and the r1 value increases compared to the one before
deprotection (Scheme 5). Thus, under acidic tissue, such as a tumor, the deprotected DAD-X might enhance the contrast imaging, and the tumor recognition
using DAD-X might be a valid system. We believe that
the obtained insights can be effectively used for the construction
of practical metal-free contrast agents in the near future.

Changes
4 Experimental Section
4.1 General Information
Infrared spectra
were recorded using a JASCO 4600 Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectrometer. UV–vis spectra were recorded using the JASCO
V570 and V760 spectrometers or the Agilent 8453 spectrometer. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured by a Bruker
Biospin AVANCE III 500 spectrometer using CDCl3 or D2O as solvents and tetramethylsilane as a reference. High-resolution
electrospray ionization mass spectra were recorded using a Bruker
micrOTOF spectrometer. The melting points were found using the Büchi
melting point apparatus M-560 (uncalibrated).

4.2 Cyclic Voltammetry (CV)
Cyclic voltammograms
were recorded using a BAS chemical analyzer (model 660C). Individual
1 mM DAD-X solutions in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS, pH = 7.4) were prepared and were bubbled in a N2 atmosphere several times. The potentials of each DAD-X solution were measured using a glass carbon as the
working electrode, the Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and the
Pt as the counter electrode. All of the scanning processes were performed
at a scanning rate of 4 mV s–1.

4.3 Electron Spin Resonance (ESR)
ESR
spectra were recorded using a JEOL JES-X310 spectrometer. Individual
50 μM DAD-X solutions in a phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS, pH = 7.4) were prepared and approximately 40 μL
solutions were added into a glass tube (Drummond Microcap 50 μL,
ϕinside: 0.80 mm and ϕoutside: 1.09
mm) until the solution height from the bottom of the tube became equal
to 8.0 cm. A quartz tube, including the DAD-X solution in the glass tube, was used to perform ESR with the following
parameters: microwave power: 1.0 mW, modulation width: 0.1 mT, modulation
frequency: 100 kHz, and time constant: 0.03 s. The values of the parameters
of the center field, receiver gain, and sweep width were set based
on the optimized value of the individual DAD-X solutions.

4.4 Stability Evaluation against the Ascorbic
Acid Using ESR
DAD-X solutions (50 μM,
100 μM) and solutions of ascorbic acid (AsA) (1.0–20
mM) were prepared in PBS. The solution which contained a high concentration
of AsA was neutralized using NaOH powder. ESR was performed using
a 50 μL solution of DAD-X (50 μM), and the
spectral intensity was recorded as the reference value for comparisons.
A mixture of DAD-X (500 μL, 100 μM) and AsA
(500 μL, 1.0–20 mM) solutions was added in a 2.0 mL tube
and was stirred using VORTEX for 3 s. After stirring, the resulting
solutions were transferred immediately into 50 μL ESR tubes,
and ESR was performed continually using the SEQUENTIAL MEASUREMENT
mode 40 times. The time spent for the preparation of the mixture of DAD-X and AsA mentioned above was regarded as the second measurement
time point. A stopwatch was used to record this time.

The resulting
data were used to estimate the intensity ratio between any given spectrum
and the Mn(II) peak that was used as an internal standard. DAD-X was used as the reference standard for comparisons at the beginning
of the measurements. Its intensity value in relation to Mn(II) was
estimated as the ratio of (Sig/Mrk)0. All of the acquired
spectra from the 40 continuous measurements were analyzed individually
using the same method.

The given data of (Sig/Mrk)/(Sig/Mrk)0 were plotted
as a function of reaction times. The plot was fitted with the use
of a pseudo-first-order reaction rate equation and yielded a pseudo-first-order
reaction rate constant (kobs). The same
analyses were conducted for different concentrations of AsA, and the
corresponding kobs values were obtained.
The given kobs values were plotted as
a function of concentrations and yielded the second-order reaction
rate constants estimated based on the slopes of the plots. ESR was
performed using the following parameters: sweep time: 10.0 s, center
field: 333.300 mT, sweep width: 2.5 mT, modulation frequency: 100.00
kHz, microwave power: 10 mW, modulation width: 1.0 × 10–1 mT, amplitude: 7.00 × 10, and time constant: 0.03 s.

4.5 Relaxivity
T1-weighted MRI and relaxivity of the samples were estimated
based on MRI acquisitions of CAs with a 1.5 T MRI scanner (Japan REDOX,
Fukuoka, Japan), and the use of a volume coil (transmission–reception
coil with an internal diameter of 38.5 mm, Japan REDOX, Fukuoka, Japan).
Aqueous solutions of the contrast agents were initially placed into
1 mL disposable syringes. These were bundled and positioned in the
center of the volume coil. The sample temperature was maintained at
25.0 ± 0.5 °C throughout the experiments with the use of
the gradient coil cooling system and air conditioners. Using the MRI
scanner, horizontal single-slice, T1-weighted,
MR images were acquired with a gradient echo pulse sequence with the
following parameters: TR/TE = 80/10 ms, slice thickness = 1.0 mm,
acquisition matrix = 256 × 256, field-of-view (FOV) = 50 ×
50 mm2, number of averages (NA) = 1, number of slices =
1. For longitudinal relaxation time (T1) and longitudinal relaxivity (r1) calculations,
horizontal, single-slice inversion recovery MRI was performed using
an inversion recovery fast spin-echo acquisition with the following

4.6 log P Calculation
log P values were obtained using the following
calculation methods. The modeling studies were performed using Spartan’08
(Wavefunction, Inc.). The conformational analysis of organic radicals, DAD-X [1(Me), 2(Et), 3(nP), 4(cP), 5(Vin), 6(Ph), 7(Py)] was conducted using the conformer distribution method
(RM1 semiempirical method). The stable conformations were subsequently
optimized in the gas phase using DFT at the UB3LYP-D3(BJ)/6-31G* level
with the use of Gaussian 16 (revision A.03). Subsequently, frequencies
were analytically computed at the UB3LYP-D3(BJ)/6-311G** level of
theory to yield Gibbs free energies (298 K, 1 atm).

The value
of log P was estimated from the computed free
transfer energy according to eq 4(24) 4  where R is the molar gas
constant, and T is the temperature.

To estimate
the log P (n-octanol/water)
values, gas-phase DFT-optimized conformers of DAD-X were
reoptimized in n-octanol and water,
respectively (UB3LYP-D3(BJ)/6-311G**//UB3LYP-D3(BJ)/6-31G*: SMD = n-octanol or water). The results of each optimization were
used to evaluate the free energy difference for the two solvents.

4.7 Toxicity
No cytotoxicity assays were
conducted in vitro or in vivo for DAD-X.
