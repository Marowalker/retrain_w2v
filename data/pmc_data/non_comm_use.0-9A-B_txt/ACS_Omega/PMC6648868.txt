Conversion
and alloying type negative electrodes attracted huge
attention in the present research on lithium/sodium-ion batteries
(LIBs/SIBs) due to the high capacity delivered. Among these, SnO2 is investigated intensively in LIBs due to high cyclability,
low reaction potential, cost-effectiveness, and environmental friendliness.
Most of the LIB electrodes are explored in SIBs too due to expected
similar electrochemical performance. Though several LIB negative electrode
materials successfully worked in SIBs, bare SnO2 shows
very poor electrochemical performance in SIB. The reason for this
difference is investigated here through combined in operando and ex situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS).
For this, the electrodes of SnO2 (space group P42/mnm synthesized via one-pot hydrothermal
method) were cycled in Na-ion and Li-ion half-cells. The Na/SnO2 half-cell delivered a much lower discharge capacity than
the Li/SnO2 half-cell. In addition, higher irreversibility
was observed for Na/SnO2 half-cell during electrochemical
investigations compared to that for Li/SnO2 half-cell. In operando XAS investigations on the Na/SnO2 half-cell confirms incomplete conversion and alloying reactions
in the Na/SnO2 half-cell, resulting in poor electrochemical
performance. The difference in the lithiation and sodiation mechanisms
of SnO2 is discussed in detail.

1 Introduction
While intercalation-type
materials are intensively used as positive
electrodes in lithium-ion batteries, the search for high-capacity
negative electrodes focuses on conversion-type materials. Development
of low-cost, high-capacity negative electrodes is highly essential
to overcome the present safety concerns with the graphite negative
electrode.1,2 These materials include ternary and binary
transition-metal oxides (MM′2O4, MO,
M, and M′ = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, etc.), phosphides, nitrides, intermetallic
alloys, etc.2−8 In addition to those, Sn-based materials have gained attention as
negative electrode materials, particularly for lithium-ion batteries
due to the reversible capacities exceeding 400 mAh g–1.9 Tin oxide, particularly SnO2, has shown excellent electrochemical performance in Li-ion batteries.10−17 Its capability as anode materials for Na-ion batteries is very promising
due to the high capacity achievable (1378 mAh g–1), where 711 mAh g–1 is obtained from a conversion
reaction (involving 4Na+ ions per formula unit) and 667
mAh g–1 through an alloying reaction (by forming
the Na-rich Na15Sn4 intermetallic).18 Moreover, low average redox potential, environmentally
benign nature, and comparatively low cost add to its advantages. However,
the practical capacity for bare SnO2 electrodes in Na-ion
batteries is found to be much lower than the theoretical value, and
the electrochemical reaction is found to be highly irreversible.19,20 The reason behind this low practical capacity was attributed in
some literature reports to the huge volume expansion of 520% occurring
during the sodiation of Sn to Na15Sn4, which
leads to pulverization and the resulting contact loss.19 This irreversibility could not be overcome by
modifying the morphology or reducing the particle size to below 100
nm.19 The electrochemical reaction mechanism
of SnO2 in Na-ion batteries is proposed to be a conversion
mechanism followed by alloying. Initially, SnO2 by reacting
with Na gets converted to NaxSn, whose
particles are embedded in a Na2O matrix. Thereafter, with
continuous increase in the concentration of Na in NaxSn, the intermetallic phase Na15Sn4 will be crystallized.20

A combination
of in situ transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) and theoretical calculations using density functional
theory has shown that the SnO2 negative electrode can behave
differently to lithiation and sodiation.20 The diffusion of Na+ in SnO2 is calculated
to be 30 times slower than that of Li+. However, composite
structures with carbon such as SnO2–graphene nanocomposites
with a three-dimensional architecture were found to deliver a capacity
of >400 mAh g–1 over 200 cycles at a current
density
of 100 mA g–1 in Na-ion batteries.21 Hence, it is important to note that the reported high capacities
for SnO2 in Na-ion batteries refer to a special material
architecture containing different forms of carbon such as graphene
or carbon nanotube and not just to bare SnO2.18,19,22,23

Several investigations were conducted in literature to elucidate
the electrochemical reaction mechanisms of SnO2 in Li as
well as Na half-cells.20,22,24−27

In 2013, Gu et al. probed the failure mechanism of SnO2 with a nanowire morphology in Na-ion batteries using in
situ TEM.20 They observed that
with sodiation, the SnO2 nanowires undergo a structural
change to NaxSn, whose particles are dispersed
in a matrix of Na2O. This sodiation reaction is observed
to induce a huge volume expansion (∼>100%).20 Moreover, the sodiation speed was found to be ∼20
times lower than that of lithiation. In addition, the Sn particles
surrounded by pores were formed as a result of desodiation due to
the vacancies arising from dealloying of NaxSn, which leads to a disconnected network, further resulting in the
fading of the capacity of the SnO2 nanowires after few
cycles.20 Ding et al. in 2014 reported
a comparison of the phase-transformation mechanisms in Li/SnO2 and Na/SnO2 cells.28 In the Na/SnO2 cell, they observed the presence of unreacted
β-Sn, surrounded by some amorphous material, which is assumed
to be NaxSn alloy at 0.01 V during discharge,
that acts as an impediment. The slow kinetics of the reaction from
Na–Sn alloys into intermetallic Na15Sn4 and the formation of intermediate crystalline SnO during Na2O to SnO2 conversion that blocks the Na+ diffusion into metallic Sn are proposed as some of the reasons behind
the low capacity obtained for the Na/SnO2 cell.28 Moreover, a systematic comparison of the sodiation-
and lithiation-related phase changes reveals fundamental microstructural
causes for the lower sodiation capacity than lithiation in SnO2.28 Different from the irreversible
nature of sodiation, a fully reversible alloying and conversion reaction
was observed for the Li/SnO2 cell using X-ray diffraction
(XRD).28 However, the presence of some
amount of amorphous residual material, that did not react back to
the initial state after discharging, below the detection limit of
the XRD cannot be ruled out at the end of the cycle.

In a work
published by Górka et al. in 2015, the electrochemical
reactions of SnO2 thin films as well as SnO2 mesoporous carbon composites with Li and Na were investigated and
compared.25 They observed a limited discharge
capacity for the Na/SnO2 system even with the use of 6–7
nm SnO2 particles, which was attributed to a sluggish reaction
kinetics due to the Na2O matrix formed during the reaction.
Even in the thin film, where the diffusion limitation is minimal,
the amount of Na, which could be extracted during the 1st charge, was observed to be less than 1Na+ per SnO2 and could be attributed to an intrinsic kinetic limitation
of the sodiation reaction in the material.25

To further elucidate the reasons behind the limited Na storage
capacity of bare SnO2, in operando investigations
were conducted on Na/SnO2 half-cells using X-ray absorption
spectroscopy (XAS) in this work. Though combined ex situ XRD, TEM, and XPS studies are reported already for the Na/SnO2 system, only few in operando investigations
were seen in the literature.20,22,24,28,29 Moreover, in operando XAS, which can probe the
bulk oxidation state changes is missing in the literature and is reported
for the first time. In addition, Li/SnO2 half-cells were
also studied by XAS so that Li/SnO2 and Na/SnO2 can be compared. The investigated bare SnO2 was synthesized
through a one-pot hydrothermal route and is thoroughly characterized
using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), TEM,
and electrochemical methods.

2 Results and Discussion
Figure 1 displays
the diffraction pattern of the as-synthesized SnO2 sample.
The set of reflections could be assigned to tetragonal rutile SnO2 with the space group P42/mnm. The obtained lattice parameters are a = b = 4.7585(4) and c = 3.1802(3)
Å, respectively. The unit cell volume was found to be 72.014(4)
Å3. The volume-weighted average crystallite size in
the a–b plane is about 6
nm and along the c-axis is about 8 nm. The lattice
strain was calculated as 1.04 × 10–3. No impurity
phases were observed as revealed by the absence of additional reflections.
In addition, the observed reflections were broader than the instrumental
resolution function, indicating the nanocrystalline nature of the
sample.

the as-synthesized SnO2.

The SEM image of the as-synthesized SnO2 sample
is shown
in Figure 2a. Primary
particles 50–80 nm in diameter, with a sphere-like morphology,
can be observed as agglomerated.

microscopy (TEM) images of the as-synthesized SnO2 by hydrothermal
method.

A closer look with TEM reveals
that the material exists as flower-like
secondary particles of ∼50 nm with primary particle size of
∼10 nm (see Figure 2b).

The cyclic voltammetry investigations were conducted
at a scan
rate of 0.1 mV s–1 in a voltage range 0.005–2.0
V vs Li+/Li and vs Na+/Na for Li/SnO2 and Na/SnO2 cells, respectively, and the results for
the 1st and 5th cycles are displayed in Figure 3.

Figure 3 (a) Cyclic voltammograms of the 1st and 5th
cycles of (b) Li/SnO2 and Na/SnO2 cells at a
scan rate of 0.1 mV s–1 in a voltage range 0.005–2.000
V.

The shape of the cyclic voltammogram
of the Li/SnO2 half-cell
is similar to the reports in literature.14,30 The broad reduction peak observed at 0.75 V in the 1st cycle could
be assigned to the crystal lattice destruction of the SnO2 particles.14 Another very broad reduction
peak is observed at ∼0.30 V, which could be attributed to the
alloying reaction of Sn with Li. A corresponding oxidation peak is
visible at ∼0.6 V related to the Sn–Li dealloying reaction.14,31 In addition, another set of broad reduction and oxidation peaks
is observed at ∼0.57 and ∼1.26 V, which could be assigned
to the SnO/Sn electrochemical reaction.14 Moreover, in the 0.005–1.00 V discharging region of the CV,
the broad peak also includes the formation of the solid–electrolyte
interface layer.18 The oxidation peak observed
at ∼1.81 V could be attributed to the SnO2/SnO reaction.
Similar behavior was observed in the 5th cycle with slightly shifted
voltages.14

For the Na/SnO2 half-cell, the reduction peak starting
around 1.6 V and coming down to lower voltages in the Na/SnO2 half-cell could be attributed to the conversion reaction of SnO2, probably without the completion of the alloying reaction
as revealed by the low amount of capacity obtained in the charge–discharge
experiment.18 The broad peak observed around
0.4 V in the Na/SnO2 half-cell corresponds to the formation
of the solid–electrolyte interface.18 In the anodic portion (oxidation part with positive currents) of
the 1st cycle of the cyclic voltammogram as well as in the cathodic
portion (reduction part with negative currents) of the 5th cycle of
the cyclic voltammogram, only poorly defined peaks could be observed.
In the anodic portion of the 5th cycle of the cyclic voltammogram,
a small peak appears at ∼0.09 V, which is attributed in literature
to the extraction of Na+ from a carbon phase, which here
could be the super C65 carbon used as a conductive additive.18 In addition, broad peaks with very low charge
flow were observed during the oxidation in the 5th cycle above ∼0.
25 V, which could be attributed to the dealloying reactions of Na–Sn
alloys taking place at a very small extent. Overall, the very low
charge flows demonstrate that only a low fraction of the active material
is taking part in the electrochemical reaction; furthermore, the reaction
remains incomplete at the end of the discharge/charge. These results
are in agreement with the data shown in literature and indicate limited
reversibility of conversion and alloying reactions of bare SnO2 material in Na-ion batteries.18,23

The
cyclic performances of the SnO2 electrodes in Li
and Na half-cells are displayed in Figure 4a,b, respectively. The measurements were
conducted at a charge–discharge rate of C/10 for the initial
four cycles and C/5 for the subsequent cycles in a voltage range 0.005–2.00
V for Li/SnO2. For the Na/SnO2 cell, slower
charge–discharge rates were applied for the cycling experiments
due to the sluggish diffusion of Na+ ions in comparison
with that of Li+ ions. Hence, the charge–discharge
rate of C/20 was applied for the initial four cycles followed by a
C-rate of C/10 for the subsequent cycles in the voltage range 0.005–2.00
V.

Na/SnO2 cells in the voltage range 0.005–2.000 V
at 25 °C.

The number of electrons
flowing through the outer circuit during
the first discharge for the Li/SnO2 half-cell correspond
to a capacity of 1542 mAh g–1. In the successive
charge, the Li/SnO2 cell delivered a capacity of 744 mAh
g–1, which is close to the theoretical capacity
(781 mAh g–1), displaying a Coulombic efficiency
of only 48%. This behavior is already well known for the SnO2 material, and the lower Coulombic efficiency is attributed to the
formation of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) as well as to the irreversible
amorphous lithium oxide on the surface of the electrode.30,32 The Coulombic efficiency increases after the 1st cycle and reaches
a value of ∼98% after several cycles. The material exhibited
a capacity retention of ∼20% after 40 cycles, which is close
to that of the values reported in literature for bare, non-modified
SnO2 samples in the Li half-cells.11,13

In the Na half-cells, the SnO2 electrode delivers
an
initial discharge capacity of 728 mAh g–1. In the
successive charge, the Na/SnO2 cell delivered a capacity
of only 67 mAh g–1, which is much lower than the
theoretical capacity (781 mAh g–1), and this behavior
is in agreement with the literature data.13,19 The Coulombic efficiency of the Na/SnO2 cell in the 1st
cycle was as low as 9%. This lower Coulombic efficiency could be attributed
to the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) as well as
to any irreversibility in the electrochemical reaction. Moreover,
it was interesting to observe that the absolute capacity values of
the Na/SnO2 cell gradually increases after few initial
cycles. A similar behavior was observed in literature reports for
the SnO2 composite electrodes when cycled against Li and
Na and for amorphous carbon when cycled against Li or Na.18,19,22 This could be due to some conditioning
of the electrode materials with respect to the structure or SEI during
cycling or due to the involvement of carbon in the electrochemical
reaction, and this requires further investigation. The Na/SnO2 cell delivered charge and discharge capacities of 90 and
92 mAh g–1, respectively, after 40 cycles. The charge
capacity delivered was ∼34% in excess compared to the initial
value.

2.1 In Operando and Ex
Situ XAS Investigations
The charge–discharge
voltage profiles of the Li/SnO2 half-cell (C-rate C/15)
are displayed in Figure 5a, where the selected voltages for the preparation of the ex situ samples are marked. The corresponding lithiation
states are shown in Figure 5c. The charge–discharge voltage profiles of the 1st
cycle conducted for Na/SnO2 (charge rate C/40 and discharge
rate C/30) during in operando XAS measurements are
displayed in Figure 5b.

Figure 5 First charge–discharge voltage profiles of (a) Li/SnO2 cell and (b) Na/SnO2 cell used for the XAS investigations.
Plots of (c) voltage vs Li content in Li/SnO2 cell and
(d) voltage vs Na content in Na/SnO2 cell used for the
XAS investigations. The voltages at which ex situ samples were prepared for Li/SnO2 cell are marked with
“▲”. The voltage range applied for conducting
the experiment was 0.005–2.000 V for the Li/SnO2 cell and 0.005–2.50 V for the Na/SnO2 cell.

While a discharge capacity of
1549 mAh g–1 was
delivered by the Li/SnO2 half-cell, only 580 mAh g–1 was delivered by the Na/SnO2 half-cell.
Correspondingly, 8.71 mol of Li and 3.26 mol of Na participated in
the electrochemical reaction during the discharge of the SnO2 electrode in Li half-cell and Na half-cell, respectively, as calculated
from the electron flow through the circuit (see Figure 5c,d). Note that in the case of Li/SnO2 half-cell, the number of moles of Li inserted into the SnO2 electrode is almost twice the theoretical amount of Li able
to be incorporated. This is a usual phenomenon reported in literature
and is attributed to the additional alloying reaction as well as to
side reactions with electrolyte.30,32,33 Moreover, at the end of the cycle, the Li/SnO2 cell regained a capacity of 898 mAh g–1, whereas the Na/SnO2 cell could deliver a capacity of
31 mAh g–1 only, even when the upper cutoff voltage
was extended to 2.5 V. The corresponding Coulombic efficiencies are
58 and 5.3% for the Li/SnO2 and Na/SnO2 cells,
respectively, and the corresponding number of moles of Li and Na involved
in the charge are 4.2 and 0.17 mol per 1 mol of SnO2, respectively.

2.1.1 Li/SnO2 Half-Cell
To
elucidate the electrochemical mechanism of Li insertion in SnO2, corresponding in operando XAS spectra on
the Sn K edge were analyzed. During the 1st discharge, where the first
Li+ uptake takes place, the position of the Sn K edge shifted
to a lower energy, indicating a reduction of Sn4+ to Sn0 oxidation state. At the discharge voltage of around 0.35
V, the edge position almost overlapped with that of the metallic Sn
foil spectra, indicating a complete conversion of SnO2 to
metallic Sn. However, towards the end of discharge, the edge position
shifted again to higher energy. At this voltage of 0.005 V, a reoxidation
of Sn can be ruled out. Therefore, this shift to higher energy at
the end of discharge corresponds to the alloying of Li and Sn.33 Furthermore, it can also be observed that the
white line intensity of the Sn K edge continuously decreases during
discharging. This indicates changes in the average local coordination
corresponding to an increase in the coordination of Sn–Sn and
a decrease in the coordination of Sn–O (see Figure 6a).27

Figure 6 (a)
Sn K edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra
during discharging of Li/SnO2 cell and the (b) corresponding
extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) Fourier transform
(FT). Inset: magnified Sn K edge region.

Direct information about the local coordination can be obtained
from the EXAFS Fourier transform (FT). The EXAFS FT of the fresh sample
is characterized by a peak between 1 and 2 Å corresponding to
the Sn–O shell. The amplitude of this peak decreases continuously
during discharge while a new peak evolves around 2–3 Å,
characteristic for metallic Sn (Sn–Sn shell). At 0.35 V, the
amplitude of this peak reached its maximum. Upon further discharge,
the amplitude of this peak decreased. This behavior greatly differs
from the conversion anodes based on oxides of first-row transition
metals by the fact that any decrease in the intensity of metal/oxygen
shell is usually accompanied by an increase in the metal/metal shell.34 This different behavior observed for the SnO2 system can be explained by the Li alloying mechanism. During
the alloying, Li enters into the Sn metal lattice, which gives a different
EXAFS signal. A similar behavior was also observed for the Pt/Ru alloy
nanoparticle system.35 During the charging
cycle, it was observed that the FT amplitude of the Sn–Sn shell
increased and reached a maximum around 1.0 V (Figure 7a).

Figure 7 (a) Sn K edge XANES spectra during charging
of Li/SnO2 cell, (b) corresponding EXAFS FT, and (c) linear
combination fitting
(LCF) analysis of the end-of-charge (EOC) sample with Sn foil, SnO2, and SnCl2 spectra as references.

The increase in the FT amplitude could be attributed
to the removal
of Li from the Li–Sn alloy (dealloying), which is just the
opposite behavior seen during the discharge cycle. Upon further charging,
a prominent peak corresponding to the Sn–O shell was formed
between 1 and 2 Å. This is further reflected in the XANES region,
where the edge position was also shifted to higher energy during charging.
In the fully charged state or at the end of charge (EOC), the white
line intensity and the energy of the absorption edge reached a maximum
value. Nevertheless, when compared to the fresh sample, the cycled
sample showed a reduced white line intensity as well as a lower energy
for the absorption edge. Similarly, in the EXAFS FT, the Sn–O
shell of the cycled sample was also characterized by a lower amplitude
compared to the fresh sample. Moreover, a significant Sn–Sn
shell was still visible for the cycled sample. Thus, it may be concluded
that the conversion of metallic Sn back to SnO2 is only
partial. Residual metallic fractions are seen at the end of charge
for several conversion anodes, and this phenomenon is one of the main
reasons behind the capacity fade observed for those systems.34

However, the metallic Sn fraction seen
for the SnO2 system
may not contribute as much to the overall capacity fade of Li/SnO2 cells in comparison with other conversion oxide systems,
as there is a possibility for this Sn fraction to alloy with Li in
the subsequent cycles.27 Linear combination
fitting (LCF) analysis of the cycled sample spectra with Sn metal
foil, SnCl2, and SnO2 reference compounds confirmed
the presence of 28% metallic Sn phase in the fully cycled state (Figure 7c). Moreover, the
oxide phase formed at the end of the cycling was characterized by
contributions of Sn2+ and Sn4+ species in a
ratio 1:1. Please note that LCF analysis was not done on the EOD sample
with Li, as no reference spectra were found suitable for quantifying
the Sn–Li intermetallics, which are present at the intermediate
states of discharge.

2.1.2 Na/SnO2 Half-Cell
The
XANES region of the XAS spectra obtained during the electrochemical
discharging of SnO2 with Na showed almost similar behavior
compared to the discharging with Li. Nevertheless, the decrease in
the white line intensity observed during the discharge of SnO2 with Na was less pronounced than in the Li case. The edge
position continuously shifted to lower energy for the lower half-cell
voltage. Note that the shift of the XANES spectra to higher energies,
as observed during the EOD of SnO2 with Li, was not observed
at the EOD with Na. Moreover, the XANES spectra obtained at the lower
voltage with Na during discharge never showed a full metallic character.
Therefore, complete conversion of SnO2 to its metallic
or alloy state can be ruled out. This conclusion is further supported
by the EXAFS FT, as a prominent peak corresponding to the Sn–O
shell was still present at the EOD with Na (Figure 8a,b). The linear combination fitting analysis
of the EOD XAS spectrum of the Na/SnO2 cell showed a contribution
of 42, 33, and 25% contribution from Sn4+, Sn2+, and Sn0 species, respectively (Figure 8c).

Figure 8 (a) Sn K edge XANES spectra during discharging
of Na/SnO2 cell, (b) the corresponding EXAFS FT, and (c)
LCF analysis of the
EOD sample with Sn foil, SnO2, and SnCl2 spectra
as references.

One of the reasons for
this poor electrochemical behavior for the
Na/SnO2 half-cell in comparison with the Li/SnO2 half-cell might be the denser Na2O shell, which acts
as an ionic as well as electronic insulator and prevents further reduction
of SnO2. This is reflected by 42% inactive SnO2 in the Na/SnO2 cell at the EOD. The LCF analysis indicated
25% of Sn in the metallic state at the EOD. However, a corresponding
Sn–Sn shell was not visible in the EXAFS FT. During alloying,
Na enters into the Sn metal lattice, which gives rise to a destructive
interference of the signal arising from the Sn–Sn metallic
shell. Such a behavior was also observed for other alloy nanoparticle
systems. Hence, the absence of peak corresponding to the Sn–Sn
shell besides the presence of 25% of metallic Sn could indicate the
Na–Sn alloy formation.35,36 Finally, during Na
extraction in the following charging, the XANES spectra were characterized
by a slight increase in the white line intensity as well as a small
shift to higher energy when compared with the EOD state. This is further
reflected in the EXAFS FT as the amplitude of the Sn–O shell
showed only a slight increase (Figure 9a,b).

Figure 9 (a) Sn K edge XANES spectra during charging of Na/SnO2 cell, (b) the corresponding EXAFS FT, and (c) LCF analysis
of the
EOC sample with Sn foil, SnO2, and SnCl2 spectra
as references.

The LCF analysis showed
that 63% Sn4+ and 37% Sn2+ species contributed
to the spectra of the EOC state (Figure 9c). Thus, all metallic
fraction formed during the discharging (Na uptake) is completely reoxidized.
The absence of any metallic Sn after cycling can be explained based
on a core–shell model: the small fraction of metallic phase,
formed during discharge, builds a shell around a core with unreacted
SnO2 embedded in a thick layer of Na2O. Therefore,
it may be concluded that SnO2 does not achieve a complete
and uniform conversion/alloying reaction with Na because of the formation
of a dense Na2O layer, which blocks electronic and ionic
transport into the inner region of the SnO2 particles,
in contrast to the reaction with Li.

3 Conclusions
Phase-pure SnO2 nanoparticles with flower-like morphology
were synthesized by a one-pot hydrothermal route. The synthesized
SnO2 nanoparticles were cycled in half-cells against Li
as well as Na. Compared to the Li/SnO2 half-cell, the Na/SnO2 half-cell delivered a much lower absolute reversible capacity.
The reasons for this electrochemical performance difference were elucidated
using in operando as well as ex situ XAS investigations using an in-house-designed electrochemical test
cell. The in operando Sn K edge XAS studies revealed
a significant difference between the lithiation and sodiation processes
in SnO2. The lithiation of SnO2 was associated
with the complete reduction of SnO2 to metallic Sn and
successive alloying of Li with Sn. The subsequent charging process
starts by dealloying Li, followed by conversion back to tin oxide.
However, the presence of a small amount of metallic Sn was still observed
at the end of the first cycle. As far as the sodiation on SnO2 is concerned, discharging with Na is associated with incomplete
conversion of SnO2 to metallic Sn. This incomplete conversion
of SnO2 can be attributed to the formation of a dense Na2O layer, which acts as a transport barrier to the flow of
Na+ ions and electrons.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Synthesis
The SnO2 samples
were synthesized using a one-pot hydrothermal method similar to the
synthesis described elsewhere.10 For this,
the sodium stannate, Na2SnO3·3H2O (Sigma-Aldrich) precursor was dissolved in ethanol–water
mixed solvent. The mixture was then heated in a Teflon-lined stainless
steel autoclave of 100 mL capacity at 180 °C for 24 h. The obtained
suspension was centrifuged and dried to separate the final SnO2 sample.

4.2 Structural Characterization
Powder
X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the as-synthesized SnO2 sample was recorded using a STOE Stadi P powder diffractometer,
equipped with a Dectris Mythen 1 K Silicon strip detector, a focusing
Ge(111) monochromator (Cu Kα1 radiation; λ
= 1.540562 Å), and a step width of 0.015° (2θ), in
a flat-sample transmission mode. Rietveld refinement was applied for
data analysis using the WinplotR package.37 For all the refined parameters, the standard deviations were calculated
in agreement with Bérar and Lelann.38

4.3 Morphology and Particle Size Characterization
The morphology of the as-synthesized SnO2 powder was
analyzed using a Zeiss Supra 55 Scanning Electron Microscope with
primary energies of 5 and 15 keV and an in-lens detector. The particle
sizes were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy using a Philips
CM20 TEM with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV and LaB6 cathode.

4.4 Electrochemical Characterization
To prepare the SnO2 electrodes, 70% (w/w) active material,
20% (w/w) super C65 carbon (TIMCAL) as conductive additive, and 10%
(w/w) poly(vinylidenefluoride) (Solef PVdF 6020 binder, Solvay) were
mixed in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP, Sigma-Aldrich).
The obtained slurry was then coated on a Cu foil with a wet thickness
of 300 μm. The coated foil was then dried overnight at 80 °C.
Electrode disks 1.2 cm in diameter were punched out of the foil, followed
by overnight vacuum drying at 110 °C. The mass loadings of the
obtained electrodes were ∼2–3 mg. To conduct the electrochemical
experiments, two-electrode Swagelok-type test cells were assembled
in an argon-filled glovebox with SnO2 as the working electrode.
For the Li half-cells, lithium foil (Alfa Aesar) was used as the counter
and reference electrodes, glass microfiber filters (Whatmann-GF/D
70 mm Ø) were used as the separator, and LP30 (1 M LiPF6 in ethylenecarbonate:dimethylcarbonate = 1:1) as the electrolyte.
For the Na half-cells, metallic Na was used as the counter and reference
electrodes, glass microfiber filters (Whatmann-GF/D 70 mm Ø)
were used as the separator, and 1 M NaClO4 in propylenecarbonate
as the electrolyte. All electrodes were electrochemically characterized
with a VMP3 multichannel potentiostat (Bio-Logic, France) at 25°C
for the ex situ experiments and at ambient temperature
for the in operando experiments. For the ex situ XAS experiments, the prepared cells were galvanostatically
charged and discharged to different cutoff voltages. Note that “charge”
here refers to delithiation/desodiation, and discharge refers to lithiation/sodiation,
respectively, in the Li/SnO2 and Na/SnO2 half-cells.
Moreover, 1C is defined as 782 mA g–1. The charged
or discharged cells were then transferred to a glovebox with Ar atmosphere
and O2 and H2O concentrations below 1 ppm. The
cells were disassembled, and the SnO2 electrodes with different
states of charge or discharge were taken out. These electrodes were
then glued between Kapton tapes. A pristine electrode was used for
comparison.

4.5 In Operando and Ex
SituXAS Investigations
The electrochemical mechanisms
of Li/SnO2 and Na/SnO2 cells were investigated
using in operando and ex situX-ray
absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Sn K edge. For the in
operando experiments, cells similar to those reported in
a previous work were used.34,39 The prepared cell was
placed in a sample holder and aligned. The in operando XAS spectra of the Li/SnO2 cell were recorded at the
Sn K edge at beamline BM 23, ESRF, and Grenoble in fluorescence geometry,
and Si(311) monochromatized beam was used to record the Sn K edge
spectra. Only the 1st discharge until 0.35 V was studied for the Li/SnO2 cell with the in operando technique due
to limited beamtime. In operando XAS spectra during
a complete cycle of Na/SnO2 cell and the ex situ XAS spectra of the disassembled electrodes for Li half-cells including
the end of discharge (EOD) of the 1st cycle were recorded in transmission
geometry at CLAESS, ALBA Synchrotron, Barcelona. Si(311) monochromatized
beam was used to record the Sn K edge spectra. The details of the
cell used and the measurement technique are published elsewhere.34,39 Processing of the spectra was performed using the Demeter software
package.40
