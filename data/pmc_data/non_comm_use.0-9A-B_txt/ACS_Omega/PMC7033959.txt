A large amount of sulfur dioxide
(SO2) will be released
during rural household coal combustion, causing serious environmental
pollution. Therefore, it is very urgent to develop a clean and efficient
fuel to substitute rural household coal controlling SO2 emission. In this paper, a new strategy toward scattered coal combustion
with remarkably reducing SO2 emission was proposed. Coal
and compound additive of Al2O3 and CaCO3 were blended and then copyrolysis at 1050 °C was performed
to produce clean coke. First, the sulfur content of clean coke was
reduced, meanwhile, generating sulfur fixation precursor during pyrolysis.
Then, clean coke is used for efficient sulfur fixation during the
subsequent combustion process to reduce SO2 emissions.
The effects of combustion temperature, Al/S molar ratio, and the mechanism
of sulfur retention during clean coke combustion were studied in the
tube furnace and muffle furnace. The mechanism can be attributed the
following reason: (a) CaS produced during pyrolysis and CaO decomposed
by complex additives were oxidized during combustion, and CaO captured
the SO2 released from clean coke combustion, which formed
CaSO4. (b) CaSO4 reacts with Al2O3 to produce calcium sulfoaluminate at high temperatures, which
improves the sulfur fixation efficiency of clean coke combustion at
high temperatures. In a word, this new strategy can greatly reduce
the emission of SO2, thus helping to solve rural household
coal pollution problems.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Coal is the most important
primary energy, and it will continue
to be the dominant energy source for China in the near future. According
to statistics, the consumption of coal reaches 490 million tons, and
the consumption of scattered coal is nearly 7.55 billion tons, of
which 234 million tons are used for the fuel combustion of the domestic
stove in 2017.1−3 However, rural household coal mostly leads to disorganized
low-altitude emissions, dispersed combustion, and incomplete combustion.
Moreover, the lack of desulfurization and denitrification equipment
results in the discharge of flue gas with high concentrations of SO2 and NOX. The emission intensity
of SO2 from residential coal burning is at least 5–8
times that of coal-fired power plants.4 How to solve the problem of SO2 emission from civil scattered
combustion is worth pondering.

Ca-based sorbents are the well-known
and commonly used sorbents
for SO2 removal from combustion gases because of their
wide availability, low price, and high efficiency.5−10 Guan11 carried out combustion experiments
of coal with three kinds of calcium-based sulfur fixing agents (CaO,
Ca(OH)2, and CaCO3) and found that Ca(OH)2 had a better effect on sulfur fixation and CaCO3 promoted the release of SO2 at low temperatures. The
CaCO3/CaO solid sorbent particle size had a significant
effect on SO2 capture, and mixed solid sorbent had higher
capture efficiency than the conventional pure solid sorbent.12 However, the SO2 emission increases
sharply when the combustion temperature was above 1100 °C. This
is due to the thermal decomposition of the conventional sulfur-fixation
product CaSO4 above 1200 °C during coal combustion.13 Therefore, how to improve the sulfur fixation
efficiency of CaSO4 at high temperatures or how to inhibit
CaSO4 decomposition is key to solve this problem.

The results show that the 3CaO·3A12O3·3CaSO4 complex can be formed by adding A12O3, which covers or wraps the surface of the CaSO4 crystal,
so that it can inhibit the decomposition of CaSO4 and improve
the sulfur fixation effect.14−16 Blast furnace
sludge (BFS) exhibits a strong sulfur-fixing ability because of the
large amount of metal oxides, such as Fe2O3,
CaO, SiO2, and Al2O3, that it contains.
The results indicated that BFS, as a sulfur-fixing agent, is cheap
and highly efficient in controlling SO2 emissions during
coal combustion processes.17 Al2O3 additive can obviously increase the sulfur-fixation
efficiency of the biomass briquette during the combustion, and is
also the reason why the efficiency increase was forming a kind of
a stable high temperature phase, that is calcium sulfoaluminate (3CaO·3A12O3·3CaSO4). The C4A3S stemming from the cement industry also was discovered as
the sulfur-fixation phase during the combustion of coal and researched
by the researchers of desulfurization to measure the optimum ratio
and the formation temperature.18−20 Therefore, considering the C4A3S as the high temperature sulfur-fixation phase
during coal combustion is feasible and significantly improves the
sulfur-fixation efficiency in coal combustion.

In this paper,
a new strategy toward scattered coal combustion
with remarkably reducing SO2 emission was proposed. The
flow chart is shown in Figure 1. Al2O3 and CaCO3 composite
additives are first added into the coal pyrolysis process in advance.
Then, clean coke is obtained by high-temperature pyrolysis, which
reduces the sulfur content in the clean coke and forms the sulfur
fixation precursor. The sulfur fixation precursor is converted to
the high temperature sulfur-fixation phase C4A3S during combustion. It can greatly improve the sulfur-fixation efficiency
of clean coke during the combustion of high temperatures above 1200
°C. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction
(XRD) were used to investigate the sulfur transformation in the coal,
coke, and coal ash during coal pyrolysis and combustion. Thermogravimetric
analysis–mass spectrometry (TGA–MS) was used to simulate
the process of combustion of clean coke so as to investigate the mechanism
of sulfur-fixation in combustion.

coal combustion with
remarkably reducing SO2 emission.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Study on SO2 Emission Characteristics
of Coal, Coke, and Clean Coke
In this study, the thermal
decomposition of raw coal, coke, coke-Ca, and coke-Ca-3%Al was analyzed
at a heating rate of 10 °C/min in the air atmosphere. The derivative
mass loss DTG and TG are shown in Figure 2. From the DTG curves for raw coal, it can
be observed that the coal sample first experienced the weight gain
process of physical adsorption and chemical adsorption at the initial
stage of coal oxidation. It can be seen from the curve that the TG
curve shows the first peak at 85.92 °C, and the sample quality
is 97.85% of the initial mass. Subsequently, because of the reaction
of the coal sample with oxygen to produce CO, CO2, SO2, and other gases,21 gas evolution
and the desorption amount gradually increased, and the coal sample
began to lose weight slowly. At 509.15 °C, the coal sample weight
loss rate reached a maximum of 13.25%/min. When the temperature reaches
to 604.41 °C, the combustible material of the sample is almost
burned out, and the TG curve gradually approaches a straight line.
The residual mass of the sample at this time was 15.49% of the initial
mass. However, there is only one peak of coke at 632.92 °C.

Figure 2 TG–DTG
curves of different coal and coke combustion [(a)
TG curves of different coal and coke combustion; (b) DTG curves of
different coal and coke combustion].

As shown in Figure 2a,b, it can be seen that the TG/DTG curves of coke-Ca and coke-Ca-3%Al
have similar trends, but the values corresponding to the characteristic
temperature points and the degree of weightlessness are different.
For the coke-Ca, the first peak in the temperature zone at around
507.26–819.31 °C for coke-Ca could be due to the release
of CO2 from the coke combustion. The second peak at 1250
°C observed for coke-Al was due to the decomposition of CaSO4. There is also a small peak at 701.55 °C.

It can
be seen that there are four obvious peaks in coke-Ca-3%Al,
and the peak points are at 390.26, 640.45, 733.83, and 1250.47 °C,
respectively. It decreased and then increased around first peak, where
Ca(OH)2 could lose water, and then, CaO reacted with oxidized
organic sulfur to form CaSO4.22,23 The peak at 640.45 and 733.83 °C indicated that not only carbon
combustion occurred at this time but also the reduction of iron oxide
by CO might occur. The fourth peak might be the decomposition of CaSO4 and the decomposition of CaSO4 wrapped in iron–silicon
complexes.

As indicated in Figure 3, the SO2 evolved showed distinctive
changes in
trend at a temperature range of room temperature to 1300 °C.
The stages of mass spectra of detected SO2 evolved in were
barely consistent with the stages of TG and DTG. A large amount of
SO2 was released during the raw coal combustion process,
and the precipitation of SO2 could be divided into two
stages: 285.40–586.86 and 913.18–1300 °C. This
was because of the reaction of FeS2 and a part of organic
sulfur with oxygen producing sulfates, oxides, and SO2 at
low temperatures (400 °C).24−26 Part of the stable organic sulfur
and sulfate sulfur in the coal began to decompose at high temperatures,
leading to a second SO2 release peak.27 For coke, SO2 precipitation was divided into
three stages: 376.11–550.44, 550.44–713.70, and 112.98–1300
°C. Coke-Ca and coke-Ca-3%Al had no SO2 release peak
at 25–1157.98 °C, and this indicated that the addition
of additives played a good role in sulfur fixation in a certain temperature
range. Moreover, the release temperature region of coke-Ca-3%Al moved
to the high temperature region, indicating that the addition of Al2O3 played a role in sulfur fixation at high temperatures.

Figure 3 MS curve
of different coal and cokes, showing that SO2 liberated
during combustion.

The SO2 emission
is greatly reduced after the calcium–aluminum
compound auxiliary agent is added to the coal. In order to obtain
mineral compositions of coal and coke samples, the XRD of different
ashes was conducted Figure 4. It shows that the XRD patterns of the raw coal ash mainly
include Fe2O3 and Al6Si2O3. The decomposition of CaCO3 can be explained
by the following facts: XRD patterns of coke contain CaO. This indicates
that the CaCO3 in coal is decomposed into CO2 and CaO in the temperature range of 700–1000 °C.28 When CaCO3 and Al2O3 compound additives are added to coal, the release of SO2 decreases at high temperatures. The XRD phase of ash is Ca2Al2SiO7. The results show that Ca2Al2SiO7 has a certain sulfur fixation
effect, which decreases SO2 emission during coke-Ca-3%Fe
combustion at high temperatures. We did a calorific test on the fuel,
and the calorific value of clean coke is 23.67 MJ/kg, which meets
the requirements of a civil fuel.

coke ashes at 1250 °C.

2.2 Influence Factor and Sulfur Forms of Coke
2.2.1 Effects of Temperature on the Sulfur-Fixation
Efficiency during Coke-Ca Combustion
The raw coal is added
to calcium, and the clean coke is prepared by high-temperature pyrolysis.
The effect of combustion temperature on sulfur retention of clean
coke was investigated, as shown in Figure 5. It can be seen that as the combustion temperature
increased from 600 to 1000 °C, the sulfur retention efficiency
was kept almost constant at approximately 100%. However, when the
combustion temperature exceeds 1000 °C, the sulfur fixation efficiency
decreases significantly. This decreasing trend of sulfur retention
could be attributed to the enhanced CaSO4 decomposition
at higher temperatures. Therefore, it is urgent to improve the high-temperature
sulfur fixation efficiency.

Figure 5 Sulfur-fixation efficiency of coke-Ca at different
combustion temperatures
(Ca/S molar ratio = 1.5).

2.2.2 Effect of the Al2O3 Content
on Sulfur Retention
Figure 6 shows the sulfur-fixation efficiency of
the coke samples with different amounts of Al2O3 at 1050–1300 °C. The sulfur fixation efficiency decreases
with the increase of Al2O3 content at 1100 °C
but increases with the increase of the Al2O3 addition ratio from 1150 to 1300 °C. When the temperature is
less than 1100 °C, adding excessive Al2O3 is unfavorable to sulfur fixation of clean coke combustion, but
when the temperature is more than 1150 °C, excessive Al2O3 is beneficial to sulfur fixation of clean coke. However,
when the proportion of alumina exceeds 8%, it is unfavorable for sulfur
fixation of clean coke. This indicates that alumina also has a “dual
effect” on sulfur fixation in clean coke combustion, which
is consistent with Liu’s study.29 On the whole, when the Ca/S is certain, it is advantageous to increase
the sulfur fixation efficiency at high temperatures by increasing
the proportion of Al2O3; the reason is that
the Al will react with the CaSO4 at high temperatures to
form calcium sulfoaluminate. The calcium–aluminum composite
additive can obviously improve the high-temperature sulfur fixation
efficiency and reduce the SO2 emission during the combustion
process, so we wondered if aluminum alone could achieve the same effect.
Next, we carried out systematic experiments on coke with different
proportions of Al2O3.

of the coke-Ca-AX with different amounts
of Al2O3 at 1050–1300
°C.

2.2.3 Effect
of the Al/S Molar Ratio on Sulfur
Retention
Figure 7 shows the sulfur-fixation efficiency obtained from the desulphurization
reaction by the feed of different Al/S molar ratios based on this
experiment. Adding Al to raw coal has little effect on sulfur retention
during the coal pyrolysis process, and the sulfur fixation efficiency
of coke ash is lower than 3%, which is lower than that of the clean
coke itself. This further indicates that the addition of Al2O3 not only promotes the release of sulfur from coal during
pyrolysis but also affects the release of sulfur from coke during
combustion. Al2O3 is an acidic component of
minerals and acid oxides in coal have little effect on sulfur release,
which is consistent with the experimental results. Therefore, considering
that calcium sulfoaluminate is difficult to decompose at high temperatures,
CaCO3 and Al2O3 are mixed with coal
in a proper proportion.

Figure 7 Effect of Al/S molar ratio on sulfur retention.

2.2.4 Analysis of Sulfur Species
for the Coke
The species of sulfur compounds in coal and
coke were investigated
using XPS. According to the binding energy signal, different sulfur
compounds were identified using the following values of pyritic sulfur
(162.5 ± 0.3 eV), thiophenic sulfur (164.1 ± 0.2 eV), sulfoxide
sulfur (166.0 ± 0.5 eV), sulfone sulfur (168.0 ± 0.5 eV),
and sulfate sulfur (169.5 ± 0.5 eV).30−32Figure 8 shows a curve-fitting of XPS
S 2p spectra of sulfur species on the surface of coke and coke-Ca-7%Al.

Figure 8 XPS spectrum
of sulfur forms in coke and coke-Ca-7%Al.

As shown in Figure 8, the sulfur morphology in coke-Ca-7%Al is mainly composed of three
categories: sulfides, thiophenes, and sulfones. Compared with coke,
the peak height and area of sulfides increase, while those of thiophenes
decrease and that sulfone sulfur changes little. On the one hand,
the compound additives increase the sulfide sulfur in the clean coke.
On the other hand, the easily decomposed thiophene sulfur is released
and converted into CaS. However, because of the presence of sulfone
sulfur consuming the oxygen-containing functional groups during the
coal pyrolysis process, no sulfate peak is seen in the figure, that
is, CaS is not oxidized to CaSO4.

The forms of minerals
present in clean coke with different Al2O3 content
are shown in Figure 9. It can be seen that the diffraction peaks
of all samples mainly contain two kinds of minerals CaS and Ca(OH)2 compared with the coke. XRD analysis suggests that the composite
additives, especially CaCO3, may react with sulfur in coal
to generate CaSO4, and Al can improve the release of organic
sulfur during the pyrolysis of coal and form amorphous composite existing
in coke. Meanwhile, the active CaO from the rest of the decomposed
CaCO3 can react with the water of pyrolysis to form calcium
hydroxide. According to experimental investigation, the Ca(OH)2 and CaS may be the main sulfur-fixation materials during
the combustion of clean coke. In addition, the peaks of FeS in the
XRD spectrum disappeared, which illustrated that the addition of Ca-based
additives could catalyze the decomposition of partial Fe2S or react directly with ferrous sulfide to form calcium sulfide,
and the other part changes to calcium aluminate and Ca(OH)2 in coke.24 It is considered that active
CaO promotes the decomposition of FeS, which results in the formation
of amorphous Fe–C by FeS. The solid–solid reaction also
had some contribution to the result.

Figure 9 XRD results of different cokes.

2.3 Effect of Combustion Temperature
on Sulfur
Fixation
Sulfur-fixation efficiency is plotted in Figure 10 as a function
of the temperature from 1050 to 1300 °C. The changing trends
of the curves are roughly the same, that is, the sulfur fixation efficiency
decreases with the increase of temperature. As shown in Figure 10, the sulfur-fixation
falls sharply at 1200 °C. The reason for the lower efficiency
of conventional sulfur-fixation product is the thermal decomposition
of CaSO4 above 1200 °C. It is worth mentioning that,
after adding 7% Al2O3 to the clean coke, the
sulfur fixation efficiency slightly increases compared with the case
in which 1–5% Al2O3 is added at 1150
°C. Meanwhile, at 1200 °C, the sulfur-fixation efficiency
of adding Al2O3 in clean coke continued to drop
off quick with the increasing temperature. The phenomenon can be interpreted
to start generating resistance to the high-temperature phase calcium
sulfoaluminate (3CaO·3Al2O3·CaSO4) as temperature increased from 1100 to 1325 °C on the
basis of the conventional sulfur-fixation product (CaSO4).33 However, when the combustion temperature
is above 1200 °C, the sulfur-fixation rate always descends rapidly
first and then increases slowly from 1200 to 1300 °C. Because
the thermal decomposition of CaSO4 is above 1200 °C,
the high-temperature sulfur-fixation product at the temperature from
1200 to 1300 °C was mainly thought to be calcium sulfoaluminate
(C4A3S). In addition, though the sulfur-fixation
rate was relatively low (less than 50%) above 1200 °C, the sulfur-fixation
rate of clean coke at the temperature range from 1050 to 1200 °C
was very satisfactory, in which the efficiencies of all samples were
more than 90% at the temperature of 1050 °C and more than 50%
at 1200 °C. At the normal combustion temperature in the chain
furnace, the sulfur removal rate of conventional burning coal by direct
adding calcium-based sorbent usually was less than 40%,34,35 which is significantly lower than that of clean coke at the same
temperature during the combustion.

Figure 10 Effects of temperature on sulfur fixation.

In order to determine the formation of calcium
sulfoaluminate at
high temperatures, the char ash after coke-Ca-3%Al combustion is selected
for XRD analysis. As can be seen in Figure 11, the main minerals are C4A3S, CaSO4, Ca2Al2SiO7 and so on. XRD analysis show that the diffraction peak of calcium
sulfate (CaSO4) at the combustion temperature of 1200–1250
°C has been disappeared, and the peak of CaSO4 decreases
gradually until it disappears from 1050 to 1250 °C. However,
the main diffraction peak of C4A3S increased
gradually from 1050 to 1250 °C. Also, the diffraction peak of
calcium aluminosilicate (Ca2Al2SiO7) appears at the temperature above 1200 °C. XRD analysis suggests
that at the combustion temperature below 1200 °C mainly contain
CaSO4 and C4A3S, while the the sulfur-fixation
products at combustion temperature above 1200 °C only contain
C4A3S without CaSO4. That is to say,
it is practicable to introduce calcium sulfoaluminate into the combustion
process of clean coke that was prepared by adding Al2O3 and CaCO3 composite additives in advance to coal
during the pyrolysis.

at different
temperatures.

2.4 Mechanism
of Sulfur Retention during Clean
Coke Combustion
Figure 12 shows the chemical impact of Al2O3 on Ca-based sorbents for high-temperature sulfur fixation during
clean coke combustion. On the one hand, CaS produced during pyrolysis
and CaO decomposed by compound additives were oxidized during combustion,
and CaO captured the SO2 released from clean coke combustion,
which formed CaSO4. On the other hand, CaSO4 reacts with Al2O3 to produce calcium sulfoaluminate
at high temperatures, which improves the sulfur fixation efficiency
of clean coke combustion at high temperatures. At the same time, CaSO4 plays a leading role when temperature is under 1200 °C,
while calcium sulfoaluminate plays a major role at above 1200 °C.
CaSO4 produced by clean coke combustion reacts quickly
with Al2O3 in a complex agent to produce the
high-temperature stable phase of calcium sulfoaluminate, which is
difficult to decompose once it is formed and the decomposition temperature
is more than 1450 °C. Therefore, the melting or decomposition
reaction does not occur at higher temperature, which greatly improves
the sulfur fixation efficiency of clean coke at high temperature combustion.

Figure 12 Schematic
diagram demonstrating the chemical impact of Al2O3 on Ca-based sorbents.

3 Conclusions
In order to solve the problem of low sulfur fixation efficiency
of clean coke at high temperatures, by adding different proportions
of Al2O3 to coal samples, the effects of Al2O3 on sulfur fixation efficiency at different combustion
temperatures are analyzed, and the coke ashes are examined through
XRD. Simultaneously, the optimum experiment reveals that the Ca/S
molar ratio 1.5 and the Al/S molar ratio below 1.5 (about 8%) as the
best additive ratio. In this case, the sulfur fixation efficiency
can reach 88% at 1050 °C and 72% at 1150 °C. The maximum
sulfur fixation efficiency of clean coke is about 59% at 1200 °C
and about 10% at 1300 °C, which is about 30% higher than that
of traditional coal combustion at low temperature. At the same time,
CaSO4 plays a leading role when temperature is under 1200
°C, while calcium sulfoaluminate plays a major role above 1200
°C. In a word, the addition of Al2O3 promotes
the generation of C4A3S and prevents the pyrolysis
of CaSO4 at high temperatures to a certain extent, greatly
increasing the sulfur fixation efficiency.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Raw Materials
A typical bituminous
coal from Shanxi Province of China was used in this experiment. Prior
to the pyrolysis experiments, the parent coals were subjected to the
conventional proximate and ultimate analyses. The respective chemical
properties of the coals are given in Table 1. The ash composition of coal is shown in Table 2. CaCO3 (99 wt %, Kemiou Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., China) and Al2O3 (Tianxing New Material Co. Ltd. Nanjing) were selected

4.2 Methods
4.2.1 Preparation of Clean Coke
First,
the coal was ground to particles of size less than 3 mm. Then, 100
g of raw coal with a certain amount of CaCO3 was mixed
according to a given proportion of Ca/S molar ratio, and then, these
mixtures were extruded into coal briquettes by an extruder. In this
paper, the Ca/S molar ratio was equal to 1.5, the high-sulfur coal
and CaCO3 were taken and mixed according to a given proportion,
and about 1, 3, 5, and 7% Al2O3 were added to
coal samples. Then, the mixtures were extruded into coal briquettes
by an extruder.

The pyrolysis experiments of coal samples were
carried out in the furnace presented in Figure 13. Pyrolysis experiments were conducted in
the furnace in ultra-high-purity N2 (99.995%) obtained
from coal samples at a heating rate of 10 °C/min from room temperature
to 800 °C under N2, and they lasted for 5 min. At
this moment, these coal briquettes were pushed into the constant temperature
zone, heated at a heating rate of 5 °C/min from 800 to 1050 °C
which lasted for an hour. Finally, all the obtained clean coke was
cooled promptly to room temperature. The heating and cooling stages
were protected by high-purity N2, which was chosen as the
carrier gas, and the flow rates were adjusted to 100 mL/min through
a mass flowmeter controller. The coke prepared by raw coal pyrolysis
directly is named coke; the coke prepared by adding CaCO3 is named coke-Ca. The clean coke is named coke-Ca-x%Al, where x represents the mass fraction of Al2O3.

Figure 13 Schematic diagram of the experimental pyrolysis
device.

4.2.2 Combustion
of Clean Coke
In order
to get a better understanding of the reactivity of the clean coke
and the secondary transfer of sulfur, the combustion of cokes was
performed and compared with that of coals. Combustion experiments
were carried out in a muffle furnace at a heating rate of 10 °C/min.
The couple containing the sample was placed in a high-temperature
muffle furnace at a heating rate of 10 °C/min from room temperature
to different temperatures (1000, 1050, 1100, 1150, 1200, 1250, and
1300 °C) and held for 1 h at each temperature to maximize the
decomposition of volatiles. The ash residues were collected to measure
the total sulfur content of ashes at different temperatures. This
experiment used two methods to detect the total sulfur in coke: the
rapid instrumental detection of sulfur and the Eshka method (Testing
Standard of China GB/T214-2007).36 Because
coke ash has a high-temperature-resistant sulfur fixation phase after
combustion and the maximum temperature of total sulfur is 1150 °C,
the content of total sulfur in coke ash was determined by the Eshka
method as follows. Ash (1.00 ± 0.01 g) was mixed with 3.00 g
of Eshka agent (mNa2CO3/mMgO = 2:1). Then, this mixture was slowly heated so that
sulfur in coke ash could be converted into soluble sulfate. Finally,
the BaCl2 solution was added at a certain acidity to transform
the soluble sulfate into BaSO4. The sulfur content in ash
was calculated as eq 1 1  where St,ad is
the sulfur content in ash (%); m1 is the
weight of BaSO4 (g); m2 is
the weight of BaSO4 in blank test (g); m is the weight of ash; and 0.1374 is the conversion factor of BaSO4 to sulfur.

The sulfur-fixation efficiency (SR, %) of
clean coke or coal burning is defined as eq 2 2  where St(ash)
is the total sulfur content after combustion, St(coal,coke) is sulfur content in coke or coal; and the ash
yield after combustion is denoted as Ad(ash).

4.3 Analysis
The crystal
structures of
clean coke and coke ash were analyzed using an X-ray diffractometer
(XRD, DX-2700x) with Cu Kα radiation (30 mA, 40 kV, Kα1 = 0.15408 mm). The X-ray intensities were detected in a continuous
scan over a range of 5.0° ≤ 2θ ≤ 85°
and a step size (2θ) of 0.03°.

XPS was used to determine
and quantify organically formed sulfur functional forms present in
raw coal and the respective transformation in clean coke brought by
pyrolysis and combustion. In this experiment, XPS S 2p signals were
acquired and recorded using an ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer
of the United States Thermo VG Company. The XPS was performed with
Al Kα radiation (hν = 15 kV) at 150 W;
the spot is 500 μm.

The coal and coke samples were tested
using a Setaram Evolution
synchronous thermal analyzer manufactured by Setaram, France, at a
heating rate of 10 °C/min in air atmosphere. The room temperature
range is from 20 to 1300 °C. The TG–MS was used to analyze
the temperature range of SO2 released during the combustion
of clean coke and to study the release of sulfur gas during coal pyrolysis
and clean coke combustion.
