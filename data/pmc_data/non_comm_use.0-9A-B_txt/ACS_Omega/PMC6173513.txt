New mesoporous silk
fibroin (SF)/silica hybrids were processed
via a one-pot soft and energy-efficient sol–gel chemistry and
self-assembly from a silica precursor, an acidic or basic catalyst,
and the ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, acting
as both solvent and mesoporosity-inducer. The as-prepared materials
were obtained as slightly transparent-opaque, amorphous monoliths,
easily transformed into powders, and stable up to ca. 300 °C.
Structural data suggest the formation of a hexagonal mesostructure
with low range order and apparent surface areas, pore volumes, and
pore radii of 205–263 m2 g–1,
0.16–0.19 cm3 g–1, and 1.2–1.6
nm, respectively. In all samples, the dominating conformation of the
SF chains is the β-sheet. Cytotoxicity/bioactivity resazurin
assays and fluorescence microscopy demonstrate the high viability
of MC3T3 pre-osteoblasts to indirect (≥99 ± 9%) and direct
(78 ± 2 to 99 ± 13%) contact with the SF/silica materials.
Considering their properties and further improvements, these systems
are promising candidates to be explored in bone tissue engineering.
They also offer excellent prospects as electrolytes for solid-state
electrochemical devices, in particular for fuel cells.

Introduction
A considerable amount
of the present research in the field of materials
science combines bottom-up approaches and soft chemistry methods targeting
the synthesis of sophisticated, recyclable, environmentally friendly,
reliable, and low energy consuming bioinspired, and biomimetic synthetic
materials.1−4 Countless natural systems display outstanding mechanical strength
and toughness, as well as damage tolerance, which is often combined
with self-repair capabilities.5 Bone,6 the abalone shell,7 the lobster cuticle,8 or the skeleton
of sea sponges9−11 are a few examples of naturally occurring hierarchically
structured nanocomposite materials encompassing exceptional performance.
As a result, the elegance of protein-directed biomineralization processes
toward high-performance hybrid materials has triggered tremendous
interest in synthetic, yet bioinspired, biopolymer/mineral hybrid
materials.1,12,13

Among
natural polymers, silk is one of the most fascinating and
versatile biomaterials. Silk exists in many variants made by different
organisms, such as spiders and silkworms,14 and each variant is adapted to its specific purpose. Spider silk
has attracted tremendous interest for application in (bio)materials
science and related fields, mainly because of its outstanding mechanical
and biological properties.14 However, because
of its availability, Bombyx mori (silkworm)
silk is the most widely investigated type of silk.15 Overall, silk has been extensively explored in various
fields, but most of the research has been directed toward innovative
applications in biomedical systems for drug delivery, enzyme immobilization,
wound dressing, adhesive fillers, and tissue engineering.14,16 More recently, the use of silk in sustainable bio-inspired devices
has raised considerable attention14,17−19 and applications of silk-based materials in optics,20−23 photonics,24 electronics,19,25−32 smart windows,32 and energy storage/conversion18,33−37 have emerged. Because of its outstanding mechanical properties,
good biocompatibility, controlled biodegradability,38−42 and ease of processing into a wide variety of shapes
(e.g., films, nanofibers, gels, hydrogels, scaffolds, micro- and nano-particles),
silk has also been proposed as scaffold for bone tissue regeneration.43−45 Silk has, however, two major drawbacks that limit its application
in the field of biomaterials:46−49 (1) it does not exhibit any osteoinductivity and
(2) it has a nonideal osteoconductivity. These shortcomings can, for
example, be overcome by association of silk with bioactive glasses
(BGs).46−49

BGs are mainly silica-based biomaterials with osteoconductive,
osteoproductive, and osteoinductive properties.50 The first attempt to prepare BGs by means of sol–gel
chemistry was reported by Li et al.,51 20
years after Hench’s pioneering work,52 showing that the sol–gel method is a particularly attractive
synthesis route. A judicious control of the sol–gel synthesis
dictates whether the materials are xerogels, aerogels, or dense materials.
This issue is a key parameter for BG design because high porosity
and high surface area BGs induce high bone bonding rates and feature
excellent degradation/resorption rates.53 A further advantage of the sol–gel process is that immobilization
of biomolecules (e.g., proteins) or biological entities (e.g., cells)
in silica matrices are possible, yielding bioactive organic/inorganic
hybrid materials.54−56

The combination of sol–gel chemistry
with supramolecular
chemistry was the seed for the development of highly ordered mesoporous
materials. It was immediately recognized that these materials are
excellent candidates for implants with the ability to provide controlled
and local drug delivery, or with improved bioactivity at the implant
site.50,57 In particular, interconnected macroporosity
within the 20–1000 μm range is mandatory in 3D scaffolds
for bone tissue engineering58,59 to guarantee penetration,
adherence, growth, and proliferation of bone cells (10–200
μm). Mesopores (2–50 nm diameter) are too small for cell
uptake, but they are particularly suited for the locally controlled
release of drugs in bone tissue (e.g., growth factors, antibiotics,
chemotherapeutic agents, anti-oestrogens, and anti-inflammatory drugs),
acting as attracting signals for bone cells. For example, Yan et al.60 demonstrated that highly ordered mesoporous
bioglasses (MBGs) with improved surface area and pore volume exhibit
significantly higher in vitro bone-forming bioactivity than regular
BGs lacking mesopores. MBGs have, however, a series of disadvantages,
including brittleness, high degradation rate, and surface instability.
These factors compromise their mechanical strength and cytocompatibility
and, therefore, limit clinical applications.

One way of overcoming
the aforementioned problems is to adopt the
organic/inorganic hybrid concept. To that end, the sol–gel
reactions are carried out using inorganic MBG precursors in the presence
of an appropriate organic co-component. The resulting organic/inorganic
hybrid materials combine the benefits of MBGs with the features of
the organic functionality, thus providing access to a wide range of
attractive (bio)hybrid materials.61 In
light of this successful strategy, the recent interest of the biomaterials
community in silk/silica hybrid systems comes as no surprise.46−49,62−70

Wu et al.46 blended silk with MBG
and
concluded that silk addition improved the following: (1) the uniformity
and continuity of the MBG pore network, while preserving high porosity
(94%) and large pore size (200–400 μm); (2) the mechanical
strength, mechanical stability, and control of burst release of dexamethasone;
and (3) bone marrow stromal cell attachment, spreading, proliferation,
and osteogenic differentiation on MBG scaffolds. In a subsequent study
Wu et al.47 implanted MBG/silk and BG/silk
scaffolds into calvarial defects in severe combined immunodeficient
mice and evaluated the in vivo osteogenesis via microcomputed tomography,
hematoxylin, eosin, and immunohistochemistry (type I collagen) analyses.
The resulting MBG/silk scaffolds exhibited improved properties (e.g.,
mechanical strength, in vitro apatite mineralization, silicon (Si)
ion release, and pH stability) with respect to BG/silk scaffolds.
More recently Cheng et al.48 showed that
MBG/silk scaffolds can be used as bone substitutes for local implantation
into critical sized osteoporotic defects. The rapid mineralization
and reduced osteoclastic activity on these MBG/silk scaffolds also
suggested a therapeutic efficacy, especially in the site of post-menopausal
osteoporosis.

A critical step in the synthesis of silk/silica
hybrids is silk
solubilization. To obtain homogeneous materials, silk needs to be
dissolved in a suitable reaction medium;15 otherwise, macroscopic silk flakes with a silica coating are obtained
rather than a true bioinspired hybrid material. Therefore, the dissolution
of silk is the most critical obstacle in the synthesis process, as
there are only very few solvents available for dissolving silk.71,72 Ionic liquids (ILs) emerged as a very attractive solution to circumvent
this drawback. Some ILs dissolve silk73−76 and even silk/biopolymer composites.77 Moreover, apart from playing the role of solvents,
ILs may also act as structure-directing agents. ILs may be viewed
as supramolecular solvents with great potential for molecular recognition,
self-assembly, and self-organization.78 The use of ILs is, thus, of the utmost interest, as they may provide
access to new silk/silica hybrid materials that have not been accessible
so far.

Motivated by the extraordinary versatility offered by
ILs, we report
in the present study a set of radically new mesoporous silk fibroin
(SF)/silica hybrid materials prepared, for the first time, by means
of a one-pot, soft sol–gel synthesis procedure, in which all
of the precursor compounds co-exist in the same reaction medium. This
new method relies on the following precursors: a Si source (tetramethylorthosilicate,
TMOS), an acid or a base exerting the role of catalysts, and the IL
1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([Bmim][Cl]) acting at the same
time as adequate solvent for the SF79 and
as template for the formation of the final mesoporous hybrid materials.
It is noteworthy that the synthesis of the MBG/silk scaffolds discussed
above involved a two-step procedure and required several compulsory
compounds. These included a Si source (tetraethylorthosilicate), calcium
source (calcium nitrate), phosphorous source (triethylphosphate),
template (Pluronic P123) and solvent (ethanol). Wu et al.46 produced MBG scaffolds upon immersion of a Pluronic
P123-containing solution in a polyurethane sponge, followed by evaporation
of the excess solution and calcination. Silk/MBG scaffolds were then
obtained through immersion of aqueous solutions of silk in the calcined
MBG scaffolds, removal of the excess solution, and drying.46 Alternatively, MBG powders were produced from
the above precursor solution via evaporation induced self-assembly,
drying, and calcination.47,48 In the latter case,
the final materials were prepared upon freeze-drying mixtures of the
MBG powders uniformly dispersed in aqueous solutions of silk.47,48 The strategy proposed here is more environmentally friendly and
more energy-efficient because it avoids the use of high-temperature
(calcination) or low-temperature (freeze-drying) processes.

Results
and Discussion
Hybrids Characterization
Figure 1 shows the physical
appearance of the SF/hybrids. Scheme 1 shows the synthetic
route and Table S1 summarizes the experimental
conditions used for the synthesis of the SF/silica hybrids. The sol–gel
reaction was performed in poly(propylene) (PP) tubes, which led to
the tubular shape of the hybrids. All hybrids are quite hard, but
brittle. H1, H3, and H4 are opaque and maintained their integrity
after removal from the PP tube. H2 is slightly transparent and lost
completely its integrity after removal from the PP tube; a similar
behavior was observed for H3′ and H4′.

Figure 1 Photographs of the SF/silica
hybrids. The maximum length of the
samples was approximately 1 cm.

Scheme 1 Scheme of the Synthesis of the SF/Silica Hybrids
Cure time: 2 days for H1–H4,
and 7 days for H3′ and H4′.

We may provide some tentative explanations for the breakdown of
H2, H3′, and H4′. Comparison of the experimental conditions
employed for the synthesis of samples H1, H2, and H4 (Table S1) leads us to suggest that the simultaneous
use of a high concentration of HCl and the incorporation of NaOH may
have caused the collapse of H2. The combined use of an acid and basic
catalysts was expected to alter the kinetics of the sol–gel
reactions (hydrolysis and condensation) of the TMOS precursor and
ultimately affect the structure, morphology, and dimensional stability
of the resulting material.80,81 In general, the condensation
reactions are rate-limiting in acid medium and the hydrolysis reaction
is rate-limiting in basic media.82 Comparison
of the synthesis procedures employed for the preparation of H3, H4,
H3′, and H4′ (Table S1) strongly
suggests that the curing process, the final step of the synthesis,
was too long in the case of the latter two samples, presumably leading
to the formation of cracks and ultimately to the disintegration of
the xerogels.

Figure 2 shows a
representative 29Si magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum of H3. The spectrum displays resonances
between −80 and −130 ppm which are assigned to silicon
sites Qx (Si(OSi)x(OR)4–x, where x is the number of Si–O–Si
bonds. The NMR signals at −91.3, −101.8, and −111.7
ppm confirm the presence of Q2 (Si(OSi)2(OR)2), Q3 (Si(OSi)3OR), and Q4 (Si(OSi)4) (where R is H or CH3) environments. Their relative proportion
was calculated by means of classical curve-fitting procedures assuming
Gaussian shapes: ca. 1, 32, and 67%, respectively. The degree of condensation q (where q = 1/4 (1 × % Q1 + 2 × % Q2 + 3 ×
% Q3 + 4 × % Q4) deduced from the spectrum is 92%, indicating the formation
of a three-dimensional silica network. This was essential to impart
to the final hybrid materials high thermal stability, essentially
amorphous nature and in particular good mechanical resistance to accommodate
the pore structure.

Figure 3 shows typical
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of samples H1 and H4′
demonstrating a rather coarse topography. SEM images obtained for
the other samples are available in Figure S1. The corresponding elemental maps obtained from energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) mapping confirm, however, a homogenous distribution of
the organic (from the C and N maps) and inorganic (from the Si maps)
components in both hybrid samples, at least on a micrometer length
scale. SEM images of the other hybrids are similar (Figure S1).

and Si (light blue) atoms.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the hybrids
(Figures 4 and S2) do not exhibit any of the typical features
of mesostructuration. However, from a careful analysis of images such
as that shown in the inset of Figure 4c, it is possible to identify a regular, ill-defined
pattern, which may be associated with the typical one-dimensional
channels of an ordered hexagonal arrangement. Unfortunately, the fast
Fourier transform analysis is not conclusive and does not permit the
estimation of a characteristic distance. The existence of small white
spots in the TEM images is, however, indicative of the presence of
pores in the SF/silica hybrids.

H4′ (c) SF/silica
hybrids.

The nitrogen (N2) adsorption/desorption
isotherms of
the H1, H3, and H4 hybrids depicted in Figure 5 demonstrate reversible type IV behavior
characteristic of mesoporous solids (pore size, i.e., distance between
the two opposite walls, ranging between 2 and 50 nm, according to
IUPAC classification).83 The shape of the
adsorption/desorption hysteresis loops correlates with the texture
(e.g., pore size distribution, pore geometry, and connectivity) of
a mesoporous material.84 On the basis of
the empirical classification of hysteresis loops given by IUPAC, we
infer from Figure 5 that capillary condensation/evaporation between relative pressures
above 0.4 induces a type H2 hysteresis loop in the three samples.
H2-type loops are typical of disordered materials in which the distribution
of pore size and shape is not well defined and is indicative of bottleneck
constrictions.84

squares)–desorption (open spheres)
isotherms of the H1 (a), H3 (b), and H4, (c) SF/silica hybrids. Inset
in (a): Pore size distribution plot obtained using the nonlocal density
functional theory (NLDFT) model for the adsorption branch isotherm
of H1.

The apparent Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface areas, pore volumes, and pore radii of H1, H3, and H4
are 263, 240, and 205 m2 g–1, 0.16, 0.19,
and 0.18 cm3 g–1 and 1.2, 1.6, and 1.6
nm, respectively. In the case of sample H2, the hysteresis of the
desorption branch suggests that N2 cannot desorb from the
pores (Figure S3). Moreover, the very low
amount of adsorbed N2 (about 7.5 cm3 g–1) indicates that this sample is nonporous. The same behavior is observed
in the adsorption/desorption isotherms of the hybrids H3′ and
H4′ (not shown).

To try to rationalize these unexpected
results, one needs to look
on the N2 adsorption method itself. Porosity includes intra-
and inter-particle porosity. Intraparticle porosity includes the open
pores (i.e., cavities or channels that communicate with the surface
of the particle) and closed pores (i.e., pores located inside the
material). With N2 adsorption measurements, only open pores
are determined. Open-ended pores and absence of pore networks are
further assumed. Taking into account the limitations of the N2 adsorption method, we associate the low-angle peak observed
in the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of H2 (gray line in Figure 6a) and H3′
(olive line in Figure 6a) with the presence of closed mesoporosity in the hybrid materials.
The organosilica framework may have collapsed leading to the concomitant
breakdown of the majority of open mesopores. The access of the N2 molecules may therefore have been blocked or considerably
limited during the N2 adsorption measurements. This effect
may explain the H2-type hysteresis adsorption/desorption loops found.

Figure 6 PXRD patterns
of selected SF/silica hybrids in the low- (a) and
high- (b) angle regions.

In the low-angle range the PXRD patterns of the selected
hybrids
exhibits a single reflection (Figure 6a) centered at 1.38° (H3 and H4′), 1.59°
(H1), and 1.65° (H2). On the basis of the very high degrees of
condensation deduced from 29Si MAS NMR, pointing out the
presence of dominant Q4 sites, a lamellar
arrangement in the silica is highly unlikely. Further assuming that
our arguments on the existence of closed mesopores are true, this
peak is tentatively attributed to the (100) reflection of a (poorly)
ordered hexagonal mesostructure with a d(100) spacing of 6.40, 5.56, and 5.35 nm, respectively. The dimensions
of the hexagonal unit cell parameter a0 (defined as the internal pore diameter plus one pore wall width
and calculated using the equation ) will then
be 7.39, 6.42, and 6.18 nm,
respectively. The marked attenuation of the low-angle reflections
in the PXRD patterns of all samples with respect to that of H4′
possibly indicates that the latter hybrid has a considerably higher
structural order than the former materials.

The lack of higher
order reflection at higher 2θ values in
all diffractograms indicates that the structural order does not extend
over a long range and that it is rather low.

In the high-angle
region, the PXRD patterns exhibit a broad and
intense reflection centered at 23.3° and two considerably weaker,
but again broad, reflections at 44.3° and 64.5° (Figure 6b). The reflection
at 23.3° is characteristic of amorphous silica-based materials
and may be attributed to ordering within the siloxane domains.85 The two weak reflections correspond to the second
and third orders of the 23.3° peak. Unfortunately, the characteristic
reflections of silk also fall in this range making the identification
of the different silk conformations present impossible.86−89

Vibrational spectroscopy is a powerful tool to gain insight
into
the conformations and packing of polymer chains. The attenuated total
reflection Fourier-transform infrared (ATR/FT-IR) spectra of the SF/silica
hybrids are shown in Figure S4. The amide
I (1700–1600 cm–1)90 and amide II (1600–1500 cm–1)90 spectral regions are particularly worthwhile
analyzing to identify the conformational changes in the SF chains
upon incorporation into the hybrid materials. The profile of the amide
I and amide II bands of all samples display absorption maxima at approximately
1630 and 1528 cm–1. These wavenumbers are characteristic
of SF chains along a β-sheet organization.91 For H2 and H4, shoulders are evident at 1658 and 1543 cm–1, pointing out the presence of random coils.

To gain additional insights into the details of the SF structure,
curve-fitting of the amide I envelope was performed (Figure 7a). The amide I band was resolved
into a series of components on the basis of the attribution proposed
by Hu et al.91 Absorption bands in the
1605–1615 cm–1 interval are assigned to side
chains; those from 1616–1637 to 1695–1705 cm–1 are assigned to ordered β-sheets, those in the 1638–1655
cm–1 range are representative of random coils, those
in the 1656–1662 cm–1 range are assigned
to α-helices, and those in the 1663–1696 cm–1 interval are assigned to turns.32,91 The integrated
area fractions of the resolved individual components for each hybrid
are shown in Figure 7b. On the basis of this analysis, the ordered β-sheet is clearly
the most abundant conformation in all materials.

Figure 7 Amide I region curve-fitting
results of the ATR/FT-IR spectra of
the SF/silica hybrids (a) and correspondent integral area fraction
(b). Notation of the different contributions to the amide I envelope:
random coils (R, green), β-sheets (B, cyan), α-helices
(A, orange), turns (T, magenta), and side chains (SC, black).

The dominance of β-sheets
is expected because the IL removal
was performed with ethanol, and the immersion of silk materials in
alcohols is known to promote the transition from disordered arrangements
to ordered β-sheets.92 These data
suggest that, globally, no major differences exist in terms of the
relative amount of SF conformations in the hybrids, except for H2,
which contains a slightly higher percentage of random coil conformations
and a lower proportion of side chains and α-helices, and for
H4′, which has more side chains but less α-helices.

It is of interest to recall at this stage that the loss of integrity
of samples H2 and H4′ was correlated above with the high HCl
concentration and high cure time employed in the synthesis, respectively.
Again, these parameters might be the cause for the slight variations
observed in terms of the relative conformations of SF chains. Overall,
ATR/FT-IR therefore shows that the experimental conditions employed
in the preparation of the hybrids did not induce significant differences
in the silk protein conformations.

The amino acid composition
of the heavy chain of SF is dominated
by glycine (Gly), alanine (Ala), serine (Ser), and tyrosine (Tyr).14 The conformation-dependent chemical shifts of
the 13C nuclei of these SF amino acids are local structure
probes.93−96 The two main conformations usually reported for B.
mori SF are often designated as silks I and II. Silk
II (often addressed as β-sheet), the main conformation adopted
after spinning, is characterized by the presence of an anti-parallel
β-sheet structure, which is responsible for the excellent mechanical
properties of silk fibers.14 Silk I forms
before spinning and its structure is more controversial.95−98 However, it is accepted that random coil conformations and silk
I give rise to the same 13C NMR chemical shifts.99−101

Figure 8 shows
the 13C cross polarization (CP)/MAS NMR spectra of the
SF/silica
hybrids. The assignment of the most relevant resonances of the Ala,
Gly, and Ser residues are indicated in Table S2. The 13C CP/MAS NMR data suggest that no significant
differences exist in the SF/silica hybrids in terms of SF chain organization.
In all cases, the dominant conformation present is the β-sheet.
However, the heterogeneity due to the presence of other protein conformations
in each sample is evident. These results are in perfect agreement
with the ATR/FT-IR data discussed above. The case of H2 hybrid is
useful to illustrate this. According to ATR/FT-IR, this sample contains
a higher proportion of random coil conformations than all other materials
of the series, a finding that is confirmed in the 13C CP/MAS
NMR spectrum in the region characteristic of the Ala Cβ residue, in which the typical resonance of the silk I conformation
is considerably more intense than that of the silk II conformation
(marked with an arrow in Figure 8).

Figure 8 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra of the H1 (black line),
H2 (gray
line), H3 (green line), H3′ (olive line), H4 (blue line), and
H4′ (navy line) SF/silica hybrids. Ala, Gly, and Ser indicate
alanine, glycine, and serine, respectively, and I and II represent
silk I and silk II conformations, respectively.

The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves of the hybrids
over
the 30–900 °C range, shown in Figure 9, display different trends in the weight
loss evolution. The weight losses can be separated into four main
temperature ranges designated as regions I, II, III, and IV. At 150
°C (end of region I), the weight loss ranging from 0.8 to 2.2%,
may be associated with the evaporation of residual solvents. The solvent
content of the SF/silica hybrids follow the ascending order: H4 <
H1 ≈ H3 < H2 < H4′ < H3′. In region
II, a sharp weight loss, due to the thermal degradation of the SF
chains, occurs.102 At 500 and 800 °C,
the average weight loss is 19.4 and 30%, respectively. At 900 °C
(region IV), about 31% of the materials remain. This residue is essentially
silica. The weight loss is less pronounced for samples H2, H3′,
and H4′.

(olive), H4 (blue), and H4′(navy) hybrids.

Cytotoxicity and Bioactivity Tests
The cellular response
of pre-osteoblasts (cell line MC3T3) to the hybrid materials was investigated
to evaluate the cytotoxic response and the effect on bone cell behavior.
MC3T3 cells were chosen to represent potential tissue in which the
materials may interact during bone regeneration. As the cell response
to a biomaterial can be affected by the material itself and the soluble
species that may leach out from it, two different cytotoxicity methods
were employed to assess the cell viability upon exposure to the SF/silica
materials.

The cytotoxicity of the hybrids was investigated
using the resazurin assay in two tests: one of the tests involved
exposure to the hybrid through direct method, whereas the other test
was carried out as an indirect method (Figure 10). Figure 10 clearly shows statistical differences between the
cell viability of MC3T3 cells cultured with all hybrids, the blank
culture minimum essential medium Eagle (MEM), and the cell viability
of the cells exposed to the cytotoxic positive control. Following
ISO 10993-5:2009 international standard, hydrogen peroxide was used
as positive control.

Figure 10 Cell viability rates of MC3T3 cells when exposed to SF/silica
hybrids
in direct and in indirect method. Horizontal red dashed line represents
the value of cell viability for positive control (cytotoxic control).

The highest cell viability is
observed in the indirect method tests
with values as large as 110 ± 21% (Figure 10) for the MC3T3 cells cultured with the
H1 hybrid. Nevertheless, all samples show quite high values of cell
viability, the lowest values being 99 ± 9%. Statistically, there
are no differences between samples. Cell viability levels were normalized
using blank MEM (as negative control), making viability levels greater
than 100% possible. The blank MEM corresponded to the cell culture
medium [supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penstrep]
normally used for cell growing purposes. This means that the negative
control was considered to be cells without being exposed to the SF/silica
hybrid material, that is, cells with 100% viability.

In terms
of the direct method test, all of the hybrids except H4
show high levels of cell viability, similar to the value presented
with blank MEM (Figure 10), ranging from 78 ± 2 to 99 ± 13%. All results
are statistically different from the cells cultured with the cytotoxic
(positive) control (H2O2) which show 13% of
viability (horizontal red dash line in Figure 10). Surprisingly H4 shows 68% of cell viability
for the direct method test, suggesting that further analysis is needed
to clarify this unusual behavior, especially in terms of the different
physical interactions that may explain the influence on the cell mechanistics.
The general trend of cell viability is lower in the direct method
than in the indirect method test. This is expected because the direct
placement of the hybrids on the cell monolayer increases the physical
interaction with the cells and, therefore, increases the physical
disruption and consequentially the cytotoxic impact.

Fluorescence
confocal imaging was used to confirm the resazurin
assay results. No changes in cell morphologies are observed in the
MC3T3 cells when exposed to the SF/silica hybrids, even when the materials
are in direct method with the cells (except H4). Imaging of MC3T3
cells shows a normal, round shape, and confluent cell monolayer after
direct and/or indirect methods with the materials (Figure 11). Moreover, there is no evidence
of cell detachment and cell death (which is observed for cells exposed
to the positive control). The only exception is H4 which shows some
cell detachment, corroborating the previous results. Overall, the
experiments show no changes in cell viability,
phenotype, or detachment of the cells exposed to the hybrids or blank
MEM, indicating that the materials could indeed find application as
biomedical materials (Figure 12).

Conclusions
[Bmim][Cl]
is an efficient solvent and template for the fabrication
of highly promising mesoporous SF/silica hybrid biomaterials with
low range order but rather high surface areas. The synthesis strategy
is based on the combination of soft and energy-efficient sol–gel
and supramolecular chemistries where [Bmim][Cl] is responsible for
the dissolution of SF and the formation of mesopores in the final
materials. The cytotoxicity/bioactivity resazurin assays and fluorescence
imaging demonstrate the high viability of the pre-osteoblast cell
line MC3T3 to the as-prepared SF/silica hybrids both in indirect (at
least 99 ± 9%) and direct (78–99%) methods. The present
work opens new avenues into hybrid SF-based biomaterials with tunable
morphology and mesoporosity induced through a judicious control of
the IL size and type. We demonstrate that the concept introduced sets
up a solid basis for future studies in bone tissue engineering. However,
these new materials also lend themselves to applications in solid
state electrochemistry, in particular for the development of composite
electrolytes incorporating mesoporous channels acting as tunnels for
fast proton conduction.

Experimental Section
Materials
TMOS
(≥99.0%), anhydrous sodium carbonate
(Na2CO3, 99.999%, Sigma-Aldrich), hydrochloric
acid (HCl, 37%, Sigma-Aldrich), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, ≥98%,
Sigma-Aldrich), and ethanol (p.a., absolute, ACS grade, Merck) were
used as received. 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([Bmim][Cl],
99%, IoLiTec Ionic Liquids Technologies GmbH) was stored under argon
prior to use. SF was obtained by cutting B. mori cocoons (Aurora Silk, Portland, U.S.A.) into ca. 3 × 3 mm2 pieces. These were treated for 45 min in a boiling aqueous
0.02 M Na2CO3 solution. The as-prepared fibers
were washed several times with distilled water and then dried in an
oven at 50 °C.

Preparation of SF/Silica Hybrids
Purified SF fibers
were dissolved in [Bmim][Cl]. To that end, dry SF was added stepwise
to a flask containing molten [Bmim][Cl] at 80 °C under magnetic
stirring to yield a 5.0% SF (w/w) solution which was stirred for 24
h under dynamic vacuum (10–3 mbar). The resulting
homogenous solutions were transparent with a yellowish hue. No solid
residue was observed.

Six SF/silica hybrids (H1, H2, H3, H3′,
H4, and H4′) were synthesized by sol–gel chemistry (Scheme 1 and Table S1). Typically, about 1.7 g of the SF/[Bmim][Cl]
solution was transferred to a PP tube (10 mL). Subsequently, TMOS
was added under constant vortexing resulting in a reaction mixture
of SF/[Bmim][Cl] solution/TMOS with a final weight ratio of 4:1. The
resulting mixtures remained biphasic even after stirring for several
hours, but upon addition of HCl (1 or 0.01 M), they became homogeneous
after a few seconds. In the case of H2, H4, and H4′, NaOH (0.01
M) was then added to allow a faster network condensation. The resulting
mixtures were then cured in an oil bath at 90 °C for 2 (H1, H2,
H3, and H4) or 7 (H3′ and H4′) days. After cooling to
ambient temperature, the IL was removed via Soxleth extraction with
ethanol and the solid was subsequently dried at ambient temperature
for at least 24 h. Attempts to produce control samples using the same
reaction conditions employed to obtain the hybrids were not successful.
When the precursor mixture was solely composed of TMOS and IL (absence
of SF), no solid material was formed. When IL lacked in the reaction
mixture composed of TMOS and SF, it was not possible to dissolve SF.

Characterization Methods
Powder X-ray Diffraction
PXRD data
were collected in
the 2θ range of 1°–10° and in the 2θ
range of 4°–90° at ambient temperature using an Empyrean
PANalytical diffractometer (Cu Kα1,2 X-radiation,
λ1 = 1.540598 Å; λ2 = 1.544426
Å) with a PIXcel 1D detector and a flat-plate sample holder in
transmission configuration (45 kV, 40 mA). Intensity data in the low
angle region were collected by the step-counting method (step 0.01°
or 0.0131°), in continuous mode, with the samples being prepared
in the middle of two thin foil acetate films.

Thermogravimetric
Analysis
TGA measurements were done
on a PerkinElmer TGA 4000 thermal analyzer from ambient temperature
to 900 °C at 10 °C min–1 under nitrogen
atmosphere (50 mL min–1).

Nitrogen Sorption
N2 sorption experiments
were performed on a Belsorp-Max, Bel Japan, Inc. Prior to analysis,
samples were degassed at 160 °C for 12 h. The apparent BET surface
areas were determined using the BET method in the 0.05–0.5
relative pressure range (p/p0). The surface area was calculated from the multipoint BET
plot, and the pore volume was determined by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
method. NLDFT pore size distributions were determined using the cylindrical
pore model of the Belsorp-software.

Attenuated Total Reflection
Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
ATR/FT-IR spectra
were measured on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet
FT-IR Nexus 470 spectrometer equipped with an ATR bridge with a diamond
crystal (Smart Orbit) and Omnic software package (version 8.1.11,
Thermo Nicolet Fisher Scientific Inc.). Spectra were collected from
4000 to 400 cm–1 by averaging 64 scans at a resolution
of 2 cm–1. Peak deconvolution was done with the
nonlinear curve-fitting procedure as implemented by the PeakFit software.103 To automatically place hidden peaks, the residuals
procedure was used. This procedure initially places peaks by finding
local maxima in a smoothed data stream. Hidden peaks are then optionally
added where peaks in the residuals occur. The best fit of the experimental
data was obtained using Gaussian shapes and by varying the frequency,
bandwidth, and intensity of the bands. A linear baseline correction
with a tolerance of 0.2% was employed. The standard errors of the
curve-fitting procedure were <0.03.

29Si MAS and 13C CP/MAS NMR Spectroscopy
29Si MAS and 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra were
recorded on a Bruker AVANCE 400 (9.4 T) spectrometer at 79.49 and
100.62 MHz, respectively. 29Si MAS NMR spectra were recorded
with 2 μs (θ ≈ 30) rf pulses, recycle delay of
60 s, and a 5.0 kHz spinning rate. 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra
were recorded with 4 μs 1H 90° pulse, 2 ms contact
time, a recycle delay of 4 s, and a spinning rate of 8 kHz. The chemical
shifts (δ) are quoted in ppm using tetramethylsilane as internal
standard.

Scanning Electron Microscopy
SEM
images were obtained
at 20 kV on a Hitachi S-3400N type II microscope equipped with a Bruker
X-flash 5010 at high vacuum. Samples were sputter-coated with gold.
Elemental mapping of the samples was performed by using the mapping
option in the EDX analysis system. The acquisition time for a satisfactory
resolution and noise performance was 1 min.

Transmission Electron Microscopy
TEM micrographs were
obtained using a Hitachi H9000na microscope operated at 300 kV. Samples
for TEM analysis were dispersed in ethanol and a drop of this suspension
was deposited on a 400 mesh copper grid coated with a carbon film.
Prior to TEM analysis the solvent was allowed to evaporate at ambient
temperature.

Cytotoxicity and Bioactivity Tests
Cell Culture
Osteoblast MC3T3 cells (passages 16–21)
were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in α-MEM, supplemented
with 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen Corp) and 10% FBS (Biowest).

Resazurin Assay
MC3T3 cells were harvested using 0.05%
trypsin/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) 1× before determining
cell concentration using a hemocytometer. Cells were seeded in a 24
well tissue culture plate (Corning), with a cell density of 4 ×
104 cells/well and incubated for 24 h prior to the addition
of the materials to allow proper adhesion. After this period, the
medium was replaced by either 1 mL of medium containing the materials
and/or their respective conditioned media (indirect method). Materials
to be tested were weighted (12–16 mg) and added to their respective
media to have a final concentration of 12 mg mL–1 cell incubation. For the indirect method, the same procedure was
followed, although the respective materials were preincubated in cell
medium at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 24 h prior to cell addition
(either in the direct/indirect methods). After 24 h of incubation
and the medium removed, cells were washed thrice with 1× PBS,
and 20% (v/v) of resazurin in medium (final volume of 1 mL) was added
in each well, following the manufacturer protocol. The resulting solutions
(aliquots of 100 μL) were transferred to a 96-well plate and
the fluorescence measurements were performed with a fluorimeter (SynergyMx,
BioTek) using a 560 nm excitation/590 nm emission filter set. Results
are shown as the cell viability percentage with respect to the untreated
cells (negative control). Hydrogen peroxide (Merck, 0.114%) was diluted
in MEM and used as positive control, based on the international standard
ISO 10993-5:2009, Biological evaluation of medical devices, Part 5:
Tests for in vitro cytotoxicity.

Fluorescence Microscopy
For confocal microscopy (Leica,
DMI6000B-CS), after 24 h exposure of the materials and/or the indirect
method as described above, MEM was removed, and cells washed thrice
with PBS 1×, before being fixed with 4% formalin solution neutral
buffered for 20 min, permeabilised with 0.1% saponin (Sigma-Aldrich)
for 5 min before staining the actin filaments using fluorescein-phalloidin
(488 nm, Invitrogen Corp.), and the nucleus with DAPI (364 nm, Sigma-Aldrich).
Images of the structure and organization of actin filaments (i.e.,
the cytoskeleton) and cell morphology/phenotype were acquired with
a Leica TCS-SP5 AOBS confocal microscope. For multicolored microscopy,
samples were excited with 364 and 488 nm laser lines, and images were
captured by multitracking to avoid bleed-through between the fluorophores.
