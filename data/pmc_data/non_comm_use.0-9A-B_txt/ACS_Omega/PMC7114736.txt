We report the synthesis of two-dimensional
porous ZnO nanosheets,
CuSCN nanocoins, and ZnO/CuSCN nano-heterostructure thin films grown
on fluorine-doped tin oxide substrates via two simple and low-cost
solution chemical routes, i.e., chemical bath deposition and successive
ionic layer adsorption and reaction methods. Detail characterizations
regarding the structural, optoelectronic, and morphological properties
have been carried out, which reveal high-quality and crystalline synthesized
materials. Field emission (FE) investigations performed at room temperature
with a base pressure of 1 × 10–8 mbar demonstrate
superior FE performance of the ZnO/CuSCN nano-heterostructure compared
to the isolated porous ZnO nanosheets and CuSCN nanocoins. For instance,
the turn-on field required to draw a current density of 10 μA/cm2 is found to be 2.2, 1.1, and 0.7 V/μm for the ZnO,
CuSCN, and ZnO/CuSCN nano-heterostructure, respectively. The observed
significant improvement in the FE characteristics (ultralow turn-on
field of 0.7 V/μm for an emission current density of 10 μA/cm2 and the achieved high current density of 2.2 mA/cm2 at a relatively low applied electric field of 1.8 V/μm) for
the ZnO/CuSCN nano-heterostructure is superior to the isolated porous
ZnO nanosheets, CuSCN nanocoins, and other reported semiconducting
nano-heterostructures. Complementary first-principles density functional
theory calculations predict a lower work function for the ZnO/CuSCN
nano-heterostructure (4.58 eV), compared to the isolated ZnO (5.24
eV) and CuSCN (4.91 eV), validating the superior FE characteristics
of the ZnO/CuSCN nano-heterostructure. The ZnO/CuSCN nanocomposite
could provide a promising class of FE cathodes, flat panel displays,
microwave tubes, and electron sources.

1 Introduction
Contrary
to bulk materials, the bottom-up approach of nanotechnology
enables us to engineer the physical behavior of materials significantly
away from their intrinsic bulk properties.1 Our ability to manipulate materials at the nanoscale has opened
the possibility to realize nano-heterostructures that combine and
modify the properties of nanomaterials. Nanoscale heterostructures
of different material compositions have shown great promise in enhancing
the efficiency and functionality of optoelectronic devices owing to
the fact that the desirable physicochemical attributes of the participating
materials complement each other. A variety of nanofabrication techniques
now exist for the synthesis of one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional
(2D) nanostructures to be employed in optoelectronic devices.2−6 Among them, 1D and 2D ZnO nanostructures7−14 are attractive earth-abundant and nontoxic materials with ideal
physicochemical and optoelectronic properties for a wide range of
functional applications, including but not limited to photocatalysts,15,16 gas sensors,17,18 and many optoelectronic devices
such as field electron emitters,11,19,20 photodiodes,21 blue light-emitting
diodes,22 and solar cells.23

Heterogeneous deposition on highly structured semiconductor
substrates
such as ZnO, TiO2, and GaN to form heterojunctions has
received great scientific interests in recent years for applications
in electronic, photoelectrical, field emission (FE), and catalytic
applications, where interface area enlargement is generally desirable.24,25 Compared to other semiconductor materials, ZnO displays several
advantages owing to its large exciton binding energy (60 meV), wider
energy gap (3.37 eV), efficient photon emission at room temperature,
high thermal stability, robust mechanical strength, and inertness
to high energy radiation. There exists significant literature about
the synthesis of various shapes and forms of nano-structured ZnO such
as nanobeads,26 nanowires,27 nanobelts,28 nanorods,29 nanotubes,30 and
nanosheets.31 Compared to its flat films,
by fabricating ZnO heterojunctions,32−35 the interface area can be significantly
enlarged by a factor of 10–100.36 ZnO-based p–n heterojunctions have therefore been examined
for light-emitting and UV photovoltaic cells, gas sensors, electroluminescence,
and photoresponse characteristics.

ZnO-based heterojunctions
are also attractive for FE applications,
where electrons are extracted from the surface of a metal/semiconductor
by an electrostatic field through quantum mechanical tunneling. The
emission of electrons from the surface of materials is of significant
interest to a wide area of applications including the use in telecommunication
satellites, medical devices, space research, X-ray sources, electronic
displays, electron microscopes, and cathode-ray tube monitors.8,9 The properties that are desirable for efficient field emitter materials
include a stable surface work function, excellent thermomechanical
properties, and the capability to achieve high aspect structures to
enable operation at low applied fields. A good field emitter must
also achieve low turn-on field and high emission current density that
is stable over a long period of time. Heterostructure designs have
recently been shown as an effective strategy for improving the turn-on
field of emitter materials.18−20 Young and Lai37 reported an enhancement in FE properties ZnO nanorods after
UV illumination and Au nanoparticle coating. Drastic improvement in
the current density of ZnO nanopillars has also been achieved by Chang
et al.38 through surface modification with
gold nanoparticles. Superior FE properties were also reported for
layered WS2-RGO nanocomposites.39

Copper thiocyanate (CuSCN), an inorganic p-type semiconductor,
is a promising heterojunction partner for ZnO to achieve enhanced
FE characteristics because of its transparency in the visible light
spectrum range,40 large direct bandgap
(3.9 eV), high hole mobility (≥5 × 10–4 S cm–1),41 excellent
chemical stability, nontoxicity, and low cost.42 Owing to their large bandgap, devices made of ZnO and CuSCN
are also suitable for preparing transparent optoelectronic devices.43 Although fabricated ZnO/CuSCN nanorod-based
p–n heterojunctions have exhibited improved efficiencies in
photovoltaic devices,44,45 it has not yet been exploited
for FE application.

In this study, we report a simple and yet
very effective low-temperature
method for fabricating the ZnO/CuSCN nano-heterostructures for FE
application. By decorating the porous ZnO nanosheets with CuSCN nanocoins,
significant improvements in FE characteristics were observed (ultralow
turn-on field of 0.7 V/μm for an emission current density of
10 μA/cm2). Our results were corroborated through
first-principles density functional theory (DFT) analyses, which predict
lower work functions for the ZnO/CuSCN heterostructure compared to
the isolated ZnO and CuSCN as the primary origin for the improved
FE. These findings demonstrate that the rational design of nanoscale
heterostructures can be used as an effective strategy to drastically
enhance the FE characteristics, such as the turn-on and threshold
electric fields and emission current density.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Structural and Compositional
Analyses
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the ZnO, CuSCN,
and ZnO/CuSCN
nano-heterostructure films are shown in Figure 1a. The porous ZnO nanosheets are characterized
by well-defined diffracted peaks [pattern (a)] with strong orientations
along (100), (002), and (101) planes, showing the polycrystalline
nature of the porous ZnO film. All aforesaid peaks were assigned to
the wurtzite structure showing the hexagonal phase for ZnO (JCPDS
file no. # 36-1451). The XRD pattern of CuSCN as depicted in pattern
(b) reveals strong diffraction peaks for the (003) and (101) planes,
which can be indexed to the rhombohedral structure (JCPDS card no.
# 29-0581).46 The XRD pattern for ZnO/CuSCN
as shown in pattern (c) represents the combination of two sets of
patterns: one from porous ZnO nanosheets and other derived from the
CuSCN nanocoins. Thus, the formation of the nano-heterostructure ZnO/CuSCN
is confirmed from the XRD pattern. The symbol (#) shown in the XRD
pattern is assigned to the peaks arising from the fluorine-doped tin
oxide (FTO)-coated glass substrate.

Figure 1 (a) X-ray diffraction pattern and (b)
Raman spectra of ZnO, CuSCN,
and ZnO/CuSCN heterostructure films.

Figure 1b shows
the Raman spectra of the ZnO nanosheets, CuSCN nanocoins, and ZnO/CuSCN
nano-heterostructures, with the spectra referenced by the Si 521 cm–1 peak. Before the deposition of CuSCN, one sharp peak
corresponding to the E2 (high) mode of hexagonal ZnO is observed at
436 cm–1.47 The highly
intense peak at 2174 cm–1 is observed in the Raman
spectra of CuSCN, which can be assigned to the characteristic stretching
C≡N bonds, whereas the peak at 430 cm–1 (the
inset of Figure 1b)
corresponds to the SCN group bending. Another sharp peak at 746 cm–1 is noticed, which corresponds to the C–S bond
stretching. Finally, the wide doublet of two peaks at 203 and 244
cm–1 can be assigned to the Cu–S and Cu–N
stretching, respectively.48 After the deposition
of CuSCN over ZnO, one can observe that the ZnO peak at 436 cm–1 exhibits an inhomogeneous broadening, indicating
the presence of the CuSCN nanocoins (inset). In the Raman spectra,
the broad peaks in the CuSCN sample at around 550 and 1100 cm–1 arises because of the background signal. Similar
Raman peaks were observed in the synthesized 2D CuSCN films and 400
nm nanowire CuSCN samples with peaks appearing at 563 and 1100 cm–1 attributed to the background signal.49,50 The Raman spectrum of the ZnO/CuSCN nano-heterostructure film has
a lower signal-to-noise ratio compared to that from pristine porous
ZnO nanosheets and CuSCN nanocoins. This may be because of the increase
in surface roughness after decoration of CuSCN nanocoins over the
porous ZnO nanosheets, providing further evidence of ZnO/CuSCN nano-heterostructure
formation. Besides, our energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS)
composition analysis of the ZnO/CuSCN film (Supporting Information, Figure S1a) demonstrates the presence of Zn and
O elements along with Cu, S, C, and N, confirming the formation of
the ZnO/CuSCN heterostructure. The average atomic % of Zn, O, Cu,
S, C, and N is tabulated in the inset of Figure S1a. The cross-sectional EDS mapping of the ZnO/CuSCN nano-heterostructure
films (Supporting Information, Figure S1b)
clearly depicts the decoration of higher concentration of CuSCN over
the top of the porous ZnO nanosheets.

2.2 Surface
Morphological Analyses
Figure 2 depicts the field
emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images of the porous
ZnO nanosheets, CuSCN nanocoins, and ZnO/CuSCN nano-heterostructures.
Large and uniform coverage of the porous ZnO nanosheets with an average
thickness of ∼30 nm was observed on the entire FTO substrate
surface (Figure 2a,b).
Similarly, Figure 2c depicts the formation of a large and uniform coverage of well-aligned
CuSCN nanocoins on the entire FTO substrate. The CuSCN nanocoins have
an estimated average diameter of 300 nm and an average thickness of
40 nm, as shown in Figure 2d. The uniform decoration of CuSCN nanocoins over the entire
surface of the porous ZnO nanosheets is noticeably observed in Figure 2e. A higher magnification
image (Figure 2f) clearly
reveals the decoration of interconnected CuSCN nanocoins over the
entire ZnO nanosheets.

Figure 2 (a,b) SEM image of 2D porous ZnO nanosheets, (c,d) CuSCN
nanocoins,
and (e,f) ZnO/CuSCN heterostructure films at low and high magnifications,
respectively.

The morphology and crystallinity
of the ZnO/CuSCN nano-heterostructure
were characterized using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HR-TEM), as shown in Figure 3a (bright field image). The lattice-resolved HRTEM image of
the ZnO/CuSCN nano-heterostructure (Figure 3b,c) clearly reveals its crystalline nature.
From Figure 3c, two
distinct fringe patterns with a d spacing of 0.25
nm corresponding to the (101) lattice plane of ZnO and 0.29 nm to
the (131) or (112) plane of CuSCN are observed. The interface (denoted
by the blue dotted line) between ZnO and CuSCN is clearly observed
from the HRTEM image (Figure 3c). The selected
area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern shown in Figure 3d reveals the polycrystalline
nature of the ZnO/CuSCN nano-heterostructure.

2.3 Optical Absorbance Spectra Analysis
Before performing the comparative FE measurements of the porous ZnO
nanosheets, CuSCN nanocoins, and ZnO/CuSCN nano-heterostructures,
it is also important to investigate the intrinsic optoelectronic properties.
Accordingly, UV–visible spectroscopy measurements have been
performed to investigate intrinsic optical absorbance characteristics
of the ZnO, CuSCN, and the ZnO/CuSCN nano-heterostructure films. The
variation in optical absorbance for ZnO films before and after decoration
of CuSCN nanocoins and pristine CuSCN on FTO as a function of wavelength
is as shown in the Supporting Information, Figure S2. The optical absorption edge of porous ZnO nanosheets
is found at 390 nm, whereas for CuSCN nanocoins, it is 325 nm. After
the deposition of CuSCN nanocoins over the porous ZnO nanosheets,
the optical absorption edge shifted to a lower wavelength (385 nm,
i.e., blue shift), which confirms the decoration of the porous ZnO
nanosheets with CuSCN nanocoins to form the ZnO/CuSCN heterostructure.

2.4 FE Studies
Figure 4a shows the emission current density as a
function of the applied electrical field (J–E curves) for the ZnO, CuSCN, and ZnO/CuSCN nano-heterostructure.
In the present case, the turn-on field defined as the field required
to draw an emission current density of 10 μA/cm2 is
found to be 2.2, 1.1, and 0.7 V/μm for the porous ZnO nanosheets,
CuSCN nanocoins, and ZnO/CuSCN nano-heterostructures, respectively.
A high emission current density of 0.16, 0.47, and 2.2 mA/cm2 has been achieved from the porous ZnO nanosheets, CuSCN nanocoins,
and ZnO/CuSCN nano-heterostructures upon the application of an electric
field of 2.9, 1.7, and 1.8 V/μm, respectively. The observed
significant improvement in the FE characteristics (ultralow turn-on
field of 0.7 V/μm for an emission current density of 10 μA/cm2) for the ZnO/CuSCN nano-heterostructure is superior to the
porous ZnO nanosheets, CuSCN nanocoins, and other nano-heterostructures
reported in the literature, as summarized in Table 1.51−56 The observed ultralow turn-on field in the case of the ZnO/CuSCN
nano-heterostructure is attributed to the nanometric feature of ZnO/CuSCN:
the high density and quasi-aligned nature of CuSCN nanocoins on porous
ZnO nanosheets (Figure 2f). In addition, from Figure 3b, it is clear that a crystalline heterojunction is formed
between CuSCN and ZnO and hence easy percolation of electrons from
ZnO to CuSCN is more favorable.

nanosheet, CuSCN nanocoins, and ZnO/CuSCN heterostructure and (b)
corresponding F–N plots.

The Fowler–Nordheim (F–N) plot, i.e., ln(J/E2) versus (1/E) of the porous ZnO nanosheets,
CuSCN
nanocoins, and ZnO/CuSCN nano-heterostructures, is shown in Figure 4b. The nonlinear
nature of the F–N plot is
consistent with the semiconducting behavior of the ZnO nanosheets,
CuSCN nanocoins, and ZnO/CuSCN nano-heterostructure emitters. Besides
the enhanced performance, the electron emission current stability
is an important parameter for device fabrication considerations. Hence,
to check the robustness of the ZnO/CuSCN nano-heterostructure, we
have measured the emission current as a function of time. Shown in Figure 5 is the emission
current versus time (I–t)
plot for the ZnO nanosheets, CuSCN nanocoins, and ZnO/CuSCN nano-heterostructures
recorded at the preset value of emission current of 1 μA over
a period of 3 h. It is evident from the results that the emission
current remains quite stable without showing any sign of diminishing
over the 3 h period of continuous testing. The variation in the current
density can be attributed to the highly surface-sensitive nature of
the FE process; hence, adsorption, desorption, and diffusion of residual
species that usually occur in the synthesis could lead to instabilities
in the form of spikes.

ZnO nanosheets,
CuSCN nanocoins, and ZnO/CuSCN heterostructures.

2.5 DFT Studies
As the FE characteristics
depend strongly on the work function (Φ) of the emitter, we
have employed first-principles electronic structure calculations based
on DFT to gain insight into the electronic structure and work function
of the isolated CuSCN and ZnO and their ZnO/CuSCN nano-heterostructure.
The β-CuSCN and ZnO crystals were modeled in the hexagonal crystal
system, as shown in Figure 6a,b, respectively. From a full geometry relaxation, the lattice
constants of β-CuSCN were predicted at a =
3.828 Å and c = 10.970 Å, which are in
good agreement with the experimental values (a =
3.850 Å and c = 10.938 Å).57 The optimized lattice parameters for ZnO are a = 3.275 Å and c = 5.284 Å, also in good
close agreement with lattice parameters: a = 3.249
Å and c = 5.206 Å.58 The electronic band gap of CuSCN and ZnO was predicted at 3.68 and
3.24 eV, respectively (Figure 6c,d), using the screened hybrid HSE06 functional59 as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation
Package (VASP).60−62 The predicted band gaps are in close agreement with
previous values of 3.6–3.9 eV for CuSCN63,64 and 3.3 eV for ZnO.58,65 The valence band edge of CuSCN
is shown to consist mainly of Cu-d states, whereas for ZnO, it is
dominated by O-3p states.

ZnO. The corresponding
PDOS is given in (c,d), respectively. Color code: Cu = brown; C =
dark gray; N = blue; S = yellow; Zn = light gray; and O = red.

The work function was obtained for the most stable
CuSCN (112̅0)
and ZnO (101̅0) surfaces (Figure 7), which were cleaved from the optimized bulk structures.
In each simulation cell, a vacuum region of length 15 Å was added
perpendicular to the surface to avoid interactions between periodic
slabs. The ZnO/CuSCN nano-heterostructure was constructed with (1
× 3)-CuSCN(112̅0) and (4 × 4)-ZnO(101̅0) supercells,
which ensured that the lattice mismatch at the interface is less than
10%. Shown in Figure 7 is the optimized structure of the ZnO/CuSCN nano-heterostructure,
with the interface shown to be composed mainly of strong covalent
Zn–S interactions. The thermodynamic stability of the heterojunctions
was evaluated through interfacial adhesion energy, calculated as Ead = (EZnO/CuSCN – (ECuSCN + EZnO)/S, where EZnO/CuSCN, ECuSCN, and EZnO are the total energy of the ZnO/CuSCN nano-heterostructure
with the interface surface area S, the individual
ground state relaxed total energy of the CuSCN, and ZnO surfaces,
respectively. The adhesion energy of the ZnO/CuSCN interfaces was
calculated to be −0.231 eV Å–2, which
indicates that the interface structure is thermodynamically stable.

Figure 7 Surface
structures of (a) CuSCN (112̅0) and (b) ZnO (101̅0)
and the equilibrium structure of the (c) ZnO/CuSCN heterostructure.

The work function (Φ) of the isolated CuSCN
(112̅0)
and ZnO (101̅0) surfaces is calculated at 4.91 and 5.24 eV,
respectively, which compare closely to known experimental measurements
of CuSCN (Φ ≈ 5 eV)66 and
ZnO (Φ ≈ 5.3 eV).67 The work
function of the ZnO/CuSCN nano-heterostructure is predicted at 4.58
eV, which is lower than that of the isolated CuSCN (112̅0) and
ZnO (101̅0) surfaces. The electrostatic potentials for CuSCN
(112̅0) and ZnO (101̅0) surfaces and the ZnO/CuSCN nano-heterostructure
are given in Figure 8. As the work function dictates the electron emission capability
of a material, the predicted lower work function of the ZnO/CuSCN
nano-heterostructure compared to the isolated material counterparts
is suggested as the primary origin for the observed enhancement in
the FE characteristics in terms of the low turn-on field. Reduction
in the work function has been observed in other composite materials
compared to the isolated materials.38 The
higher work function of the ZnO(101̅0) surface than that of
CuSCN(112̅0) suggests that spontaneous electron transfer will
occur from CuSCN(112̅0) to ZnO(101̅0) after the two are
coupled together. Consistent with this, as shown in Figure 8, the Fermi level (EF) of CuSCN(112̅0) is higher than that
of ZnO(101̅0), again indicating that electrons will transfer
from CuSCN(112̅0) to ZnO(101̅0) when they are coupled.
The transfer will stop and the charge equilibration reached when the EF position of the CuSCN(112̅0) surface
becomes the same as that of the ZnO(101̅0) surface. The calculated
energy band alignment between the two materials with respect to a
common vacuum level is shown in Figure 9. The conduction and valence band offsets between ZnO(101̅0)
and CuSCN(112̅0) are predicted at 2.25 and 1.84 eV, respectively.
The ionization potential (IP), which indicates the position where
the valence band edge is observed, is calculated at 7.68 eV for ZnO(101̅0)
and 5.84 eV for CuSCN(112̅0). The lower conduction and valence
band edges of ZnO(101̅0) than CuSCN(112̅0) with a type-II
band alignments suggest that conduction electrons will migrate to
the ZnO(101̅0) and valence holes to CuSCN(112̅0).

3 Conclusions
In summary, we report a cost-effective
and simple solution chemical
routes of chemical bath deposition (CBD) and successive ionic layer
adsorption and reaction (SILAR) methods to prepare ZnO nanosheets,
CuSCN nanocoins, and ZnO/CuSCN nano-heterostructures at low temperatures.
The formation of the ZnO/CuSCN nano-heterostructure is demonstrated
to result in significant improvement in FE characteristics. The turn-on
field required to draw a current density of 10 μA/cm2 is found to be 2.2, 1.1, and 0.7 V/μm for the ZnO, CuSCN,
and ZnO/CuSCN nano-heterostructure, respectively. The superior FE
characteristics of the ZnO/CuSCN nano-heterostructure compared to
the isolated ZnO and CuSCN materials can be ascribed to the lower
work function of the ZnO/CuSCN nano-heterostructure compared to the
individual ZnO and CuSCN materials. Our analyses and results provide
an efficient strategy for improving the FE characteristics in related
composite nanostructures via morphological and electronic modifications.

4 Experimental Details
4.1 Synthesis of Porous ZnO
Nanosheets
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
and Merck, India,
and were used as received without further purification. Prior to the
deposition, the FTO-coated glass substrate with a sheet resistance
of about ∼10 Ω/cm2 was ultrasonically cleaned
using soap solution followed by rinsing with acetone for 15 min and
then finally rinsing with double distilled water (hereafter DDW).
The synthesis of porous ZnO nanosheets was performed using a soft
chemical route on the precleaned FTO substrate. The synthesis process
includes (i) modification of the FTO substrate with a thin and compact
layer of uniformly coated ZnO nanoparticles using the modified chemical
bath deposition (M-CBD) technique, followed by (ii) growth of porous
ZnO nanosheets in aqueous solution using the CBD method.68 The film synthesis was performed at low temperature
(<100 °C) followed by annealing at 200 °C for 1 h to
obtain the pure ZnO phase. The complete reaction mechanism and preparation
parameters were similar to those reported in the work of Baviskar
et al.69

Concisely, for the deposition
of a dense/compact ZnO layer, 0.05 M zinc acetate dihydrate solution
was prepared in DDW with addition of 25% NH3 till the pH
becomes ∼11. This resultant solution was used as a source of
cations which was kept at room temperature and the DDW maintained
at 90 °C is used as the anion source. The modified CBD technique
was used for the deposition of the dense/compact ZnO layer over the
FTO substrate. The dipping time in a cationic and anionic precursor
was 5 and 10 s, respectively. A similar process was repeated for 20
immersion cycles to get a uniform and compact ZnO layer. Finally,
the deposited films were washed with DDW, dried in air followed by
annealing at 200 °C for 1 h, and used for further deposition
of porous ZnO.

Porous ZnO nanosheets were chemically deposited
using a mixture
solution of zinc acetate dihydrate (0.2 M) and hexamine (hereafter
HMTA, 0.02 M) in DDW. In order to maintain the pH at ∼11, 25%
NH3 solution as a complexing agent was added with constant
stirring. The premodified FTO substrate (coated with dense ZnO) was
introduced into the above mentioned solution bath and maintained at
room temperature for 20 h. The as-deposited film was then annealed
at 200 °C for 1 h to remove the hydroxides and improve the crystallinity
of the nanosheets.

4.2 Decoration of Porous ZnO
Nanosheets with CuSCN
Nanocoins by SILAR
The decoration of CuSCN nanocoins on the
porous ZnO nanosheets was carried out using the SILAR technique at
room temperature.70 The anionic precursor
was prepared by adding 100 mM copper sulphate and 100 mM sodium thiosulphate
in DDW. The sodium thiosulphate acts as a reducing and complexing
agent. Potassium thiocyanate (70 mM) in DDW was used as a cationic
precursor. The immersion time was kept at 15 s in both anionic and
cationic precursors. The rinsing was performed for 10 s in ion-exchanged
DDW. The immersion cycles were repeated for 20 cycles in order to
optimize the uniform coverage of CuSCN nanocoins over the porous surface
of ZnO nanosheet films followed by final rinsing with DDW and drying
in air at room temperature.

4.3 Reaction Mechanism
It is well-known
that the structure and morphology of crystals depend on the intrinsic
property and external conditions. It is hard to alter the intrinsic
properties of the material but easy to tailor the external conditions.
The formation of ZnO sheet-like morphology can be justified with OH– ion concentration71 supplied
from aq NH3 and reduction of HMTA to HCOH (formaldehyde)
and NH3 (ammonia) in the solution bath (eqs 1 and 2).72 In the present case, the excess OH– ions and abundant Zn[(NH3)4]2+ anions
(eqs 3–5) can stabilize the surface charge and the structure
of Zn(001) surfaces to some extent.73 Growth
along (100) and (101) planes was dominant over the (002) direction
because of excess OH– ions and high concentration
of Zn2+ ions in the reaction bath, which resulted in the
formation of ZnO nanosheets after annealing (eqs 6 and 7) and the same
is also supported by XRD results. 1   2   3   4   5   6   7  

In the SILAR technique, the cationic
and anionic solutions alternately react via the precursor decomposition
process on the surface of the immersed substrate to yield heterogeneous
nucleation and growth of the desired film.74 Initially, copper(II) sulfate and sodium thiosulfate dissolve in
DDW, leading to the release of cupric and thiosulfate ions, respectively,
in the solution. These thiosulfate ions are useful in reducing cupric
ions (Cu2+) to cuprous ions (Cu+). Later, a
redox reaction between the cuprous and thiosulfate ions results in
the formation of the thiosulphatocuprate(I) complex (eq 8). The thiosulphatocuprate(I) complex
is then reacted with thiocyanate ions to form solid CuSCN (eq 9). The powdery material or loosely bounded ions
were removed by rinsing the substrate in DDW. 8  

4.4 Characterizations and Measurements
Structural
properties of the films were measured using an X-ray diffractometer
(Bruker D8 ADVANCE) with Cu Kα radiations (λ = 1.5406
Å) in the 2θ range from 10 to 80°. The optical absorption
spectra were measured by UV–vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu,
model no. UV 2600) in the wavelength range between 300 and 800 nm.
Raman spectra of the films were recorded in the spectral range of
100–3200 cm–1 using a Jobin-Yvon T64000 Raman
scattering system with an Olympus microscope equipped with a 50x magnification
lens in a backscattered configuration. A Nd:YAG laser was used as
an exciton source operated at 532 nm wavelength and an output power
of ∼10 mW was focused on the sample using a fiber optic probe
head. The surface morphology of the nanostructure films was observed
using a field emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S-4800)
and using a transmission electron microscope (Tecnai G2 20 Twin, FEI). EDS attached with an
FESEM unit was used to determine the elemental compositions of chemically
prepared ZnO, CuSCN, and ZnO/CuSCN nano-heterostructure films. The
FE measurements such as current density–applied field (J–E) and current–time (I–t) were carried out in a “close-proximity”
(planar diode) configuration using an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) field
emission microscopy (FEM) system (Excel Instruments model: I-100).
The schematic presentation of the FE experimental setup is shown in Scheme 1. The ZnO, CuSCN,
and ZnO/CuSCN nano-heterostructure grown onto the FTO-coated glass
substrate served as the cathode and FTO served as the anode. Provision
for the back contact was performed using a conducting carbon tape
with the anode and cathode separation distance kept at 1 mm. The area
(A) of all emitters was 0.25 cm2 and the
current density J is defined as J = I/A, where I is the emission current. The UHV FEM system was heated for 12 h
at 150 °C and a pressure of 1 × 10–8 mbar
was achieved. The current calibration was performed by measuring the
voltage across a resistor, and for dc high voltage application, Glassman
(USA) power supply was used.

Scheme 1 Schematic Presentation of the Field
Emission Experimental Setup
The first-principles DFT calculations were performed using the
Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP),60−62 a periodic
plane wave DFT code which includes the interactions between the core
and valence electrons using the project augmented wave (PAW) method.75 An energy cutoff of 600 eV and a Monkhorst–Pack76k-point mesh of 7 × 5
× 3 and 7 × 7 × 5 were used to sample the Brillouin
zone of the bulk CuSCN and ZnO, respectively. Geometry optimizations
were performed using the conjugate-gradient algorithm until the residual
Hellmann–Feynman forces on all relaxed atoms reached 10–3 eV Å–1. The electronic exchange–correlation
potential was calculated using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
generalized gradient approximation functional.77 To accurately reproduce the experimentally known band gaps
and density of states features of CuSCN and ZnO, the screened hybrid
functional HSE0659 was used with the exchange
values of 5 and 25%, respectively. The projected density of states
(PDOS) was calculated using the tetrahedron method with Bloch correction.78

The surfaces of CuSCN and ZnO were created
from the optimized bulk
materials using the METADISE code,79 which
ensures the creation of surfaces with zero dipole moment perpendicular
to the surface plane.80 CuSCN (112̅0)
and ZnO (101̅0) were considered for the nano-heterostructure
ZnO/CuSCN formation because these do not contain any dangling bonds
and resulted in low energy and nonpolar terminations. In order to
align the energies to the vacuum level, a slab-gap model was constructed,
and the corresponding electrostatic potential was averaged along the c-direction, using the Macro Density package.81−83 The work function (Φ) was calculated as Φ = Vvacuum – EF, where Vvacuum and EF are the vacuum and Fermi level, respectively. Dipole
correction perpendicular to all surfaces was accounted, which ensured
that there is no net dipole perpendicular to the surfaces that may
affect the potential in the vacuum level. The IPs were calculated
when the slab vacuum level is aligned to the bulk eigenvalues, through
the core level eigenvalues in the center of the slab, using the 1s
orbital of O (ZnO) and S (CuSCN) as the reference point.
