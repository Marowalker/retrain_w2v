The development of technologies integrating
solar energy conversion
and energy storage functions is critical for limiting the anthropogenic
effects on climate change and preventing possible energy shortages
related to the increase of the world population. In our work, we explored
the possibility to integrate the conversion and storage functions
within the same multifunctional biosourced material. We identified
the redox-active, quinone-based, melanin pigment, featuring a broadband
absorption in the UV–vis region, as the ideal candidate for
such an exploration. Electrodes of melanin on carbon paper were investigated
for their morphological, optical, and voltammetric characteristics
prior to being assembled into symmetric supercapacitors operating
in aqueous electrolytes. We observed that, under solar light, the
capacity and capacitance of melanin electrodes significantly increase
with respect to the dark conditions (by 22 and 39%, respectively).
Once in a supercapacitor configuration, besides featuring a Coulombic
efficiency close to 100% after 5000 cycles, the capacitance and capacity
of the electrodes, rated by the initial values, improve after prolonged
illumination, as it is the case for the energy and power density.

1 Introduction
The
development of sustainable and efficient energy conversion
and storage technologies is critical for limiting the anthropogenic
effects on climate change and preventing possible energy shortages
related to the increase of the world population.1

The Sun is the most abundant renewable energy source
for our planet.
Electrochemical technologies have been widely investigated to store
intermittent solar energy, after its conversion into electrical energy
by photovoltaic (PV) cells.2,3 In this regard, the
development of technologies integrating solar energy conversion and
energy storage functions, aiming at maximizing the efficiency of the
solar light utilization, is of utmost importance. Photo-supercapacitors
and solar batteries are examples of such integrated technologies.4 A number of energy conversion/storage integrated
structures have been reported in the literature, based on different
types of PV (e.g., dye-sensitized, perovskite, and hybrid) and storage
devices (e.g., Li-ion batteries, redox flow batteries, and supercapacitors;
please refer to the review of the literature reported in Table S1). A promising development is represented
by the possibility to integrate the conversion and storage functions
within the same multifunctional material. Suitable optical absorption
and electrochemical energy storage properties are essential for such
a multifunctional material to satisfy the requirements for integrated
solutions based on only one photo- and redox-active material. Sustainability,
i.e., being abundant, nontoxicity, low cost, biosource, or synthesis
along the principles of green chemistry, is another essential requirement
for such a material.

Nature is a source of abundant, environmentally
benign, carbon-based
redox-active materials, capable of absorbing solar energy. Quinone-based
molecules are organic redox materials widely studied for electrochemical
energy storage.5−18 Liang et al. exploited polypyrene-4,5,9,10-tetraone as an anode
in aqueous Li+ batteries (pH 7) and obtained a specific
capacity of 229 mAh g–1, with 80% capacity retention
after 3000 cycles.12 Sun et al. reported
on polydopamine as an electrode and a binder material; capacities
as high as 1818 and 500 mAh g–1 were reported for
Li+ and Na+ batteries, respectively.16 Vonlanthen et al. fabricated polyaniline–benzoquinone–hydroquinone
electrodes for supercapacitors with high cycling stability (>50 000
cycles) and high pseudocapacitance (1500 F g–1).19

Eumelanin, a quinone-based pigment ubiquitous
in flora and fauna,
is an attractive candidate to explore the feasibility of integrating
energy conversion and storage functions, within the same material.
Eumelanin features a number of physicochemical properties, apart from
redox activity: UV–vis absorption, photoconductivity, hydration-dependent
electrical conductivity, metal-binding affinity (chelation), antioxidant,
and free radical scavenging.20−22 Eumelanin is based on 5,6-dihydroxyindole
(DHI) and 5,6-dihydroxyindole carboxylic acid (DHICA) building blocks
(Scheme 1), coexisting
in different redox states. Natural eumelanin (Sepia melanin, extracted
from cuttlefish ink) can contain up to 50% DHICA, in molecular ratio.23 Chemically controlled melanins (DHI-melanin
and DHICA-melanin, obtained from the polymerization of only one of
the two eumelanin building blocks) are used in the literature to elucidate
fundamental aspects of physicochemical processes taking place in melanin.
UV–vis spectra of DHICA-melanin feature an absorption peak
below 400 nm and a weaker visible-light absorption, compared to those
of DHI-melanin.24 The decreased visible
absorption of DHICA-melanin is attributable to the steric hindrance
of the carboxyl groups on the DHICA building blocks leading to nonplanar
polymer structures that limit electronic delocalization and transport.24,25

of the Building Blocks of Eumelanin: 5,6-Dihydroxyindole (DHI) and
5,6-Dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA). R is −H in DHI,
whereas R is the −COOH Group in DHICA. The Quinone Imine Form
(QI) is the Tautomer of Q
Eumelanin-based electrodes assembled into supercapacitors
and Na+ batteries operating in aqueous media have been
reported in
the literature.7,26 Kumar et al. reported on the
use of Sigma melanin as a supercapacitor electrode material (specific
capacitance 167 F g–1, specific capacity 24 mAh
g–1, and capacitance retention 75% after 1000 cycles).26 Kim et al. reported on natural and synthetic
melanin as cathode (specific capacity of 61.6 mAh g–1) and anode (specific capacity of 16.1 mAh g–1)
materials.7,27 The pigment has also been investigated for
photovoltaic applications.28,29

The combination
of optical and redox properties in the multifunctional
eumelanin pigment calls for the exploration of the possibility to
enhance the electrochemical energy storage performance of eumelanin-based
electrodes under solar light illumination. The superior optical and
electrochemical energy storage properties of DHI melanin over the
DHICA counterpart24,25 render DHI-melanin the ideal
synthetic candidate to explore the full potential of melanin for integrated
conversion and storage technologies. To model the behavior of natural
melanin, studies making use of synthetic melanin, obtained from the
two building blocks, are pertinent.

In this work, we report
on the effect of solar light on the electrochemical
energy storage properties of eumelanin electrodes on carbon paper,
assembled in supercapacitors operating in aqueous electrolytes. We
used chemically controlled melanins, namely, DHI-melanin and DHI/DHICA-melanin
(weight/weight 7/3), the latter to model the behavior of natural melanin.23 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used
to gain insight into the morphology of our samples. Cyclic voltammetry
was initially performed in dark and light conditions. Afterward, we
assembled the supercapacitors and characterized their electrochemical
behavior. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to shed
light on the working principle of the devices.

2 Results
and Discussion
The optical absorption spectra of DHI- and
DHI/DHICA-melanins show
a broadband absorption (Figure 1). Such type of absorption has been explained by different
models, such as the chemical disorder model, which considers the absorption
of eumelanin as the convolution of the absorption of chemically different
chromophores coexisting in eumelanin, and the geometric disorder model,
which considers excitonic couplings between different π–π
stacked oligomers.30,31

and (b) DHI/DHICA-melanin
spin-coated on Corning glass (loading 0.1 mg cm–2). SEM images of (c) DHI-melanin and (d) DHI/DHICA-melanin drop-cast
on carbon paper and stained with uranyl acetate, obtained in backscattered
electron (BSE) mode, with an accelerating voltage 5 kV. The bright
regions correspond to eumelanin chelating uranyl oxycations.32,33

SEM images show that DHI- and
DHI/DHICA-melanins are immobilized
on the networked structure of the high-surface area carbon current
collectors (Figure 1c and 1d). DHI-melanin seems to be preferentially
located on flat regions between the carbon fibers. On the other hand,
DHI/DHICA-melanin is preferentially located between parallel fibers.

After the characterization of the optical properties of DHI- and
DHI/DHICA-melanins, we proceeded to their voltammetric investigation
in a suitable aqueous electrolyte, under dark and light conditions
(Figures 2a, 3a, S1, and S2). Considering
the favorable proton transport properties of eumelanin, acidic electrolytes
were considered.34 Broad redox features,
slightly more pronounced under light irradiation, are observable at
0.05 and −0.1 V vs Ag/AgCl. Apart from such broad features,
the voltammograms are characterized by a quasi-box-shape typical of
pseudocapacitive materials. With respect to electrical double-layer
supercapacitors, e.g., based on bare carbon that stores energy by
an electrostatic process, redox-active (pseudocapacitive) materials
permit to achieve higher capacitances due to their higher charge storage
capacity, related to Faradic processes.35 Light enhances the current of the quasi-box-shaped voltammograms
of melanin on carbon paper, suggesting the presence of photoenhanced
(pseudo)capacitive behavior (Figures 2a, 3a, S1, and S2). The capacity, as deduced by cyclic voltammetry, increases
by ca 22% (from 2.3 to 2.8 mC cm–2) for DHI-melanin
and by 17% (from 1.8 to 2.1 mC cm–2) for DHI/DHICA-melanin.
On the other hand, the capacitance (deduced by cyclic voltammetry)
increases by ca 39% (from 3.8 to 5.3 mF cm–2) for
DHI-melanin and by 26% (from 3.1 to 3.9 mF cm–2)
for DHI/DHICA-melanin (Table S2). Bare
carbon paper does not contribute significantly to the overall current
under dark and light conditions (Figure S4).

and electrochemical impedance experiments are performed in a three-electrode

Based on the promising voltammetric results, in terms of
photoresponse
and stability (Figures S1 and S2), we assembled
two melanin electrodes into a symmetric supercapacitor configuration
and proceeded to device characterization. Galvanostatic charge and
discharge measurements were conducted adopting the following protocol:
dark (1000 cycles) → light (1000 cycles) → 40 min irradiation
(without current or potential applied) → light (1000 cycles)
→ dark (1000 cycles) → light (1000 cycles), with the
positive electrode facing the light source (Scheme S1). Figures 2b and 3b show a nearly triangular shape of
the galvanostatic charging–discharging curves, obtained at
a current density of 5 A/g (Figure S5).
The quasi-linear dependence of the charge stored vs potential further
supports our claim about the pseudocapacitive behavior of melanin.36

The small voltage drop at the beginning
of the discharge (ΔV, ca 68 mV under light
conditions, for both melanins) indicates
the low equivalent series resistance, ESR , where Idis is the constant (discharging) current. The supercapacitor capacitance CSC, where s is the slope
of the cell voltage over time during discharge; the Coulombic efficiency
η ,
where tch is
the charging time, Ich is the constant
charging current, and tdis is the discharging
time; the maximum power density Pmax, where Vmax is the operating voltage
(upper limit of the potential while charging,
or cutoff potential) and wsc is the loading
of the active material; and the maximum energy density Emax were then calculated for different experimental
conditions.37

Figures 2c and 3c show Coulombic
efficiencies of ca 100% through
5000 cycles for both DHI- and DHI/DHICA-melanins. After 3000 cycles
and 40 min of light irradiation, the capacitance of our two melanins,
rated to the initial values, increases to a value of ca 96% from a
value of 88% observed after 1000 cycles in the dark (Figures 2c and 3c). At the same time, the capacity rated to the initial value increases
from ca 86 to ca 103% for DHI-melanin and from ca 80 to ca 94% for
DHI/DHICA-melanin (Figures 2d and 3d, and Tables S3 and S4). The values of the ESR are significantly stable
after 40 min of continuous irradiation (Figures 2d and 3d).

Comparing
the average values calculated for the range of cycles
1001–2000 and 2001–3000, including 40 min of irradiation
between the two ranges of cycles, the power density increases by ca
56% (from 3.8 to 5.9 W g–1) and the energy density
by 18% (from 44 to 52 mJ g–1, i.e., from 0.0122
to 0.0144 mWh g–1), for DHI-melanin. In other words,
the irradiation of the samples in the absence of applied electrochemical
potential increases the power density and energy density of the device.
Analogously, for DHI/DHICA-melanin, the power density increases by
12% (from 5.3 to 5.9 W g–1) and the energy density
by 6% (from 27 to 28 mJ g–1, i.e., from 0.0075 to
0.0078 mWh g–1).

To study the pseudocapacitive
behavior of melanins under light
conditions, we carried out electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
measurements.38 Nyquist plots of both melanin
electrodes (Figures 2e, 3e, and S3)
show a pseudocapacitive behavior for both dark and light conditions,
modeled by the equivalent circuit reported in the inset of Figures 2e and 3e. Ru is the uncompensated resistance
that includes the electronic resistance of the electrodes and the
ionic resistance of the electrolyte. Ru is affected by the cell geometry (i.e., by the distance between
the working and reference electrodes). Ru is in series with the charge-transfer resistance, Rct, which describes the kinetics of the electron-transfer
processes, namely, the Faradic reactions taking place at melanin.
Pseudocapacitive processes, such Faradic reactions, give rise to a
capacitive response that is modeled with the constant phase element Q, in parallel with Rct, to
take into account any deviation from an ideal capacitive response.
The impedance of Q is ZQ = (1/Q)(jω)−n, with ω being the frequency; it corresponds to that
of a pure capacitor when n = 1. For n = 1, the imaginary impedance Im(Z) relates to the
capacitance as for the following equation: Im(Z)
= j/(ωC). The (RctQ) parallel elements describe the high-frequency semicircle (that
is only partial due to the selected frequency range; Figures 2f and 3f). The diameter of the semicircles corresponds to Rct. The equivalent circuit also includes a Warburg element
(W), which describes any process controlled by diffusion (ion diffusion
through the melanin on carbon paper but also diffusion of electrons
through melanin). The Nyquist plots indicate that, for both melanins
electrodes, light has an effect on the electrode impedance. Indeed,
the high-frequency resistances shift toward lower values under light
exposure, thereby suggesting that the electronic resistances, that
contribute to Ru and Rct, decrease too. Simultaneously, the low-frequency Im(Z) decreases, implying that the capacitance increases. Bare
carbon paper has almost the same resistance under light and dark conditions
(Figure S4). These observations support
the hypothesis that the Faradic reactions that drive the pseudocapacitive
response of melanin electrodes are promoted by light illumination.
It is not possible to separately fit the high-frequency semicircle
to get Rct (the semicircle is not complete
because only a few points are available in the corresponding frequency
range). Therefore, to better quantify the impedance changes under
light and dark conditions, we fitted the low-frequency linear plots
(2 kHz to 82 Hz region) with a simplified circuit RtotQ (Figures 2f and 3f), where Rtot includes the uncompensated and charge-transfer
resistance, i.e., Rtot = Ru + Rct, and is in series
with Q, the capacitive element. Importantly, the
fitting procedure indicates a 15% decrease in Rtot for DHI-melanin and a 11% decrease in DHI/DHICA-melanin
after light exposure (Table S5).

We explain the increased responses of DHI- and DHI/DHICA-melanins
under irradiation conditions by the action of the light that increases
the number of charge carriers stored in the melanin (Scheme 2). In the dark, the positively
biased melanin electrode (with redox species largely present in the
SQ and Q redox forms) experiences electron transfers from SQ to the
carbon paper to produce Q. When light is absorbed by melanin, it excites
electrons from the ground electronic state to the excited state, from
where electrons are easily transferred to the carbon paper. Therefore,
the total capacity of melanin is enhanced under irradiation by the
higher number of electron-transfer events due to photoinduced transfers
from excited states taking place in parallel to the transfers due
to applied electrochemical potential. In other words, the observed
increase of melanin capacity under illumination can be explained with
the enhancement of the kinetics, under light conditions, of the Faradic
reactions that drive the pseudocapacitive response of the melanin
electrodes. This enhancement of the kinetics brings about higher charge
accumulation at the Inner Helmotz Plane (IHP) and consequently higher
CIHP (IHP capacitance). On the negatively biased electrode,
SQ is the redox state of melanin expected mainly to accept electrons
(H2Q is already in the reduced form, and Q is expected to have been
already reduced because of the electrochemical potential applied).
Furthermore, the light-induced increase of the charge-carrier density
in melanin on carbon electrodes is expected to improve the capacitive
contribution of the solid component (namely melanin on carbon) of
the electrode/electrolyte interface, leading to the improvement of
the overall capacitance.36

Work
3 Conclusions
We reported on the use of chemically controlled melanins (DHI-
and DHI/DHICA-melanins) processed by a simple, environmentally friendly
method as sustainable organic redox materials for light-assisted (pseudo)supercapacitors
where the storage performance of the device is improved under solar
light. The broadband absorption and the redox properties of the natural
biopigment melanin inspired us to explore the possibility to enhance
the storage properties of melanin electrodes under solar light. We
observed that the solar light improves the capacitance, capacity,
stability, and decreases the resistance of the melanin electrodes.
Coulombic efficiencies of ca 100%, during 5000 cycles, were observed.
After 3000 cycles and 40 min light irradiation, the capacitance and
capacity of our melanin electrodes, rated to the initial value, improved
significantly. Despite the fact that the electrode capacitance is
low compared to that of commercial supercapacitors, these findings
are of interest for microenergy-storage applications, like those required
for wearable and implantable devices. Comparing the average values
calculated for the range of cycles 1001–2000 and 2001–3000,
including 40 min of irradiation between the two ranges of cycles,
the maximum power density increased by ca 56% (from 3.8 to 5.9 W g–1), whereas the maximum energy density increased by
18% (from 44 to 52 mJ g–1) for DHI-melanin. In other
words, the irradiation of the samples, in the absence of applied electrochemical
potential, enhances the power and energy density of the devices. This
points to the remarkable operational robustness of our organic electrodes
under illumination conditions. When comparing the performance of DHI-
and DHI/DHICA-melanins, we observe that DHI-melanin features superior
storage performance. Among others, such an observation points to the
role of the melanin structure on the electrochemical energy storage
properties: the structure of DHI-melanin is characterized by an ordered
π–π stacking expected to promote efficient electronic
transport, which is beneficial to the overall storage performance.
In agreement with that, the relatively disordered structure of DHI/DHICA-melanin
is expected to lead to poorer performance.24

Other organic materials extracted from natural sources featuring
biodegradability are currently investigated by our research groups
for their light-assisted energy-storage performance to demonstrate
the universality of the organic solar electrochemical energy storage
concept. The outcomes of our research impact a broad range of fields,
from environmentally benign energy technologies that avoid toxic,
critical, and expensive materials to biocompatible powering elements
and autonomous wearable devices.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Preparation of DHI- and DHI/DHICA-Melanins
on Carbon Paper
Chemically controlled eumelanins, i.e., DHI-melanin
and (7/3 weight/weight) DHI/DHICA-melanin, were synthesized in situ
on carbon paper by a solid-state polymerization method already reported
in the literature.39,40 Ten milligram per milliliter
solution of DHI was prepared in ambient conditions and used as a precursor.
For DHI/DHICA-melanin, 10 mg of powder, including 7 mg of DHI monomer
powder and 3 mg of DHICA monomer powder, was dissolved in methanol
in ambient conditions, and the solution was used as a precursor. Afterward,
the monomer solution (10 μL) was drop-cast on the carbon paper
(Spectracarb 2050A, 10 mils, geometric area 1.0 cm2). The
loading of melanin on each carbon paper current collector was ca 0.1
mg cm–2. After drop-casting, the samples were exposed
to NH3 vapors from NH3(aq) (Sigma-Aldrich, 28–30%
w/v) for about 68 h to catalyze the polymerization reaction.

4.2 Preparation of the Electrolytes
Buffer
solutions of NaCH3COO, 0.25 M and pH ca 5, were prepared
from NaCH3COO (Sigma-Aldrich >99%) and CH3COOH
(Sigma-Aldrich >99.7%) dissolved in deionized water (18.2 MΩ
cm).

4.3 Electrochemical Measurements
Electrochemical
measurements were performed using a Biologic bipotentiostat (SP-300)
in a three-electrode cell, with carbon paper current collectors loaded
with melanin as the working electrode, a Pt mesh as the counter electrode,
and Ag/AgCl(aq) in 1 M KCl as the reference electrode.
For galvanostatic measurements, two identical melanin-on-carbon-paper
electrodes were employed as working and counter electrodes and Ag/AgCl(aq) in 1 M KCl as the reference electrode to monitor each
electrode behavior during the tests. A solar simulator (SLB300A, Sciencetech)
was used for electrochemical experiments under light conditions (1
Sun).

Cyclic voltammetry was performed in the potential range
−0.4 V/0.4 V vs Ag/AgCl(aq) at 5 mV s–1 adopting the following sequence: dark (6 cycles) → light
(16 cycles) → dark (14 cycle). After that, electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted in a three-electrode
setup, within the frequency range of 105–10–1 Hz, adopting the sequence EIS (dark) → 40
min irradiation (without electrochemical potential applied) →
EIS (light). With the same sequence and setup, another set of EIS
measurements were conducted, at open-circuit potentials (OCP), within
the frequency range of 106–10–1 Hz, adopting the sequence: OCP vs time (dark) → EIS (dark)
→ 40 min irradiation (without electrochemical potential applied)
→ OCP vs time (light) → EIS (light). Two identical electrodes
were precycled (5 cycles) in the potential range −0.6 V/0.6
V vs Ag/AgCl(aq) at 5 mV s–1, and then
galvanostatic charge–discharge characterizations under dark
and light conditions were performed in supercapacitor symmetric configuration,
with 1 mm interelectrode distance (to avoid possible heating effects
on the device performance). Five thousand cycles of galvanostatic
charge–discharge were performed, with a current density of
5 A g–1 and a cutoff potential of 0.4 V. An Ag/AgCl
reference electrode was used to monitor the potential of the positive
and negative electrodes during the galvanostatic charge/discharge.

We monitored the temperature of the cell using two experimental
configurations: a thermocouple attached to the outer wall of the electrochemical
cell and a thermometer immersed in the cell. The cell, during the
temperature measurements, contained NaCH3COO buffer aqueous
solution (pH 5) and three electrodes (cyclic voltammetry configuration,
without nitrogen purging). The temperature was monitored for ca 2
h, every 5–10 min. The results of the measurements indicate
that the temperature change was ≤3.5 °C during light irradiation.

4.4 Morphology
The morphology of the
melanin on carbon electrodes was examined by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM, JEOL JSM7600F) at an acceleration voltage of 5 kV in backscattered
electron (BSE) imaging mode. The melanin on carbon electrodes were
stained with uranyl acetate for 1 h prior to morphology examination
by SEM.25,26,32,33

4.5 Optical Characterization
The UV–vis
spectra of DHI- and DHI/DHICA-melanin samples, spin-coated (30 s at
2000 rpm, 10 mg mL–1 solution) on Corning glass
(pre-cleaned 25 mm × 20 mm, thickness 0.96–1.06 mm), were
acquired by a PerkinElmer LAMBDA 1050 spectrophotometer equipped with
a Labsphere integrating sphere, allowing for the total reflected R and transmitted T radiation to be measured
simultaneously and obtaining the resulting absorption of the films
by posing A = 1 – (R + T).
