Isoniazid
is an important first-line antitubercular drug used in
the treatment of all major clinical manifestations of tuberculosis,
including both pulmonary and cerebral diseases. However, it is associated
with significant drawbacks due to its inherent hydrophilic nature,
including poor gut permeability and an inability to cross the lipophilic
blood–brain barrier, which, in turn, limit its clinical efficacy.
We hypothesized that the addition of a hydrophobic moiety to this
molecule would help overcome these limitations and improve its bioavailability
in the bloodstream. Therefore, we designed a stable, covalently linked
lipid–drug conjugate of isoniazid with a short lipid chain
of stearoyl chloride. Further, lipid–drug conjugate nanoparticles
were synthesized from the bulk lipid–drug conjugate by a cold
high-pressure homogenization method enabled by the optimized use of
aqueous surfactants. The nanoparticle formulation was characterized
systematically using in vitro physicochemical analytical methods,
including atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy,
differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, attenuated total
reflectance, particle size, ζ-potential, and drug release studies,
and the mechanism of drug release kinetics. These investigations revealed
that the lipid–drug conjugate nanoparticles were loaded with
an appreciable amount of isoniazid conjugate (92.73 ± 6.31% w/w).
The prepared lipid–drug conjugate nanoparticles displayed a
uniform shape with a smooth surface having a particle size of 124.60
± 5.56 nm. In vitro drug release studies showed sustained release
up to 72 h in a phosphate-buffered solution at pH 7.4. The release
profile fitted to various known models of release kinetics revealed
that the Higuchi model of diffusion kinetics was the best-fitting
model (R2 = 0.9929). In addition, confocal
studies showed efficient uptake of lipid–drug conjugate nanoparticles
by THP-1 macrophages presumably because of increased lipophilicity
and anionic surface charge. This was followed by progressive intracellular
trafficking into endosomal and lysosomal vesicles and colocalization
with intravesicular compartmental proteins associated with mycobacterium
tuberculosis pathogenesis, including CD63, LAMP-2, EEA1, and Rab11.
The developed lipid–drug conjugate nanoparticles, therefore,
displayed significant ability to improve the intracellular delivery
of a highly water-soluble drug such as isoniazid.

1 Introduction
Isoniazid (INH) is an
important oral antitubercular drug (ATD)
recommended by the World Health Organization for the first-line management
of all major clinical manifestations of tuberculosis (TB). INH has
an aqueous solubility of 230 mg/mL at 25 °C, the highest reported
among all first-line oral ATDs. Unfortunately, as a consequence of
this inherent hydrophilic nature, the drug is associated with significant
drawbacks that limit its clinical efficacy.1 The most important among them are the poor gut permeability of the
small molecule and its inability to cross the lipophilic blood–brain
barrier, both of which limit the systemic bioavailability of the drug.2

Strategies for improving the permeability
of hydrophilic drugs
include encapsulation in hydrophobic matrices, such as lipophilic
polymers or lipids, and subsequent formulation of the drug-encapsulated
matrix at the nanoscale as colloidal or stably suspended nanoparticles.
Among the so-called “lipid nanoparticle formulations”
(LNFs), solid lipid nanoparticles and nanostructured lipid carriers
have received considerable interest due to their ability to overcome
the limitations of many colloidal carriers.3−7 However, it has also been shown that in comparison
with lipophilic drugs these LNFs cannot incorporate extremely hydrophilic
drugs in a stable and efficient manner.8−10 This is primarily because
the drug tends to partition toward the aqueous phase during the process
of production. Although an effort has already been made to tackle
this problem in TB treatment, encapsulation of hydrophilic drugs into
the hydrophobic core of most LNFs still remains a major challenge.11

A potentially more refined strategy is
that of the design and synthesis
of lipid–drug conjugate nanoparticles (LDC-NPs). Here, a hydrophilic
drug is converted into a water-insoluble lipid–drug conjugate
(LDC) by covalent linkage with lipid components,12 thereby creating an amphiphilic prodrug molecule. The selected
drug moiety should ideally have a suitable terminal functional group,
such as an amino or hydroxyl group. This would enable facile conjugation
with the corresponding reactive species, such as a carboxyl group,
present in the lipid component. The insoluble LDC is initially prepared
either by salt formation or by covalent linking, following which the
bulk LDC is reformulated into lipid nanoparticles, typically by using
a cold high-pressure homogenization technique.13

LDC-NPs present a viable alternative drug carrier
system to traditional
colloidal carriers such as liposomes, nanoemulsions, and polymeric
nano- and microparticles, as they possess advantages of controlled
drug release, drug targeting, increased intestinal permeability, and
enhanced bioavailability. It has been reported that drugs incorporated
into lipids and stabilized by the use of various surfactants show
high permeability because both lipids and surfactants act as good
permeation enhancers of drugs in the gastrointestinal tract. This
is mediated by the solubilization of the drug in the intestinal milieu
and a reduction in the first-pass metabolism, by transport of the
drug through the lymphatic route to the systemic circulation.14,15 The surfactant mixtures used for the stabilization of the LDC-NPs
have their own role to play in increasing the permeability of the
drug through the intestine by inhibiting the P-glycoprotein efflux
pump present in the intestinal brush border region.16,17 Finally, from a translational perspective, LDC-NPs offer scalability
and ease of production. When coupled with the use of lipid excipients
having “generally regarded as safe” status, and avoidance
of organic solvents for production,18 these
formulations may also benefit from improved acceptance by regulatory
agencies.

Bone-marrow-derived monocytes are the prime source
of circulating
monocytes in blood, which can differentiate into macrophages on demand
in distinct tissue and represent the forefront of human innate immune
defense. In the process of monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation,
they expressed different cellular receptors to interact, sense, and
internalize pathogenic bacteria as well as nanoparticles.19,20 Kinetics of cellular uptake and endocytic fusion, which mimic the
engulfment of pathogenic bacteria by autophagy in macrophages, is
the only way to replicate and represent the efficacy of engineered
nanoparticles. On this account, THP-1 has a history of nanoparticle-mediated
drug development in various diseases due to its availability, wide
range of differentiation, expression of macrophage surface markers
and phagocytic capability, which replicate human macrophages under
laboratory conditions.21,22 It helps create an in vitro model
to study the mechanistic approach of cellular uptake and cell–nanoparticle
interactions. We have directed our molecular investigation and endocytic
trafficking in THP-1 cells to counteract the large population of bacteria
residing in macrophages during mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb) infection.23

We hypothesized that the addition of a
hydrophobic moiety, in particular
a short-chain lipid such as stearoyl chloride (SC), to INH would create
a novel formulation that could potentially overcome the limitations
posed by the drug’s inherent hydrophilic nature. The low permeability
(log P of −0.402 at 25 °C) of
this drug makes it a good candidate for delivery via a lipid-based
nanoparticulate system, as this would improve its gut permeability
and, subsequently, its bioavailability in the bloodstream. Furthermore,
INH contains a free terminal amino group, which may be employed in
the formation of covalent linkages with the selected lipid moiety.
A literature survey also revealed that there has been no report to
date on the synthesis of LDC-NPs containing ATDs such as INH. Therefore,
the specific objective of this study was to synthesize LDC-NPs for
oral delivery of INH. Further, a thorough in vitro characterization
and drug release study of the optimized LDC-NPs would be performed
to assess their suitability for clinical translation for use in antitubercular
therapy.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization
of Bulk LDC
2.1.1 Thin-Layer Chromatography
(TLC)
A possible synthetic reaction scheme and a representative
TLC run
of the optimized LDC are shown in Figure 1 (Top) and (Bottom), respectively. As seen
in lane A, INH exhibited a spot at Rf value
0.6. In lane B, the LDC exhibited a spot at Rf value 0.84, and in lane C, the spot for stearoyl chloride
exhibited a spot at Rf value 0. From the Rf values, it is evident that INH and LDC exhibit
spots at different Rf values, thereby
implying that the conjugation reaction was completed and no free INH
was left in the LDC after washing. This confirmed that the entire
mass of INH was utilized in the conjugation reaction, thereby also
confirming the formation of the lipid–drug conjugate. It can
also be inferred that the synthesized bulk LDC is less polar than
INH, as it travels more distance on the TLC plate in comparison with
INH.

LDC. TLC runs for confirmation of the formation of the LDC (Bottom).

2.1.2 Attenuated Total Reflectance
(ATR)
ATR spectra of pure INH, SC, and the synthesized LDC
are presented
in Figure 2. Pure INH
(Figure 2A) shows characteristic
peaks at wavenumbers 3208.42 and 3107.16 cm–1 corresponding
to a primary amine (N–H stretch), 3739.67 cm–1 for the N–H stretch coupled with primary amide, 2987.69 cm–1 for the aromatic C–H stretching, 1663.16 cm–1 for the C=O stretching in a cyclic ring, and
1492.58 cm–1 for the aromatic C=C stretching.
The peak at 1220.84 cm–1 is due to the aromatic
C–N stretch present at the pyridine ring of INH. The ATR spectrum
of SC (Figure 2B) indicates
its characteristic peaks at 2922.87 cm–1 for the
alkane C–H stretch present at the long chain, 1800.56 cm–1 for the C=O stretching, and 720.73 cm–1 for the characteristic C–Cl stretching.

Figure 2 ATR spectra
of (A) pure INH, (B) pure SC, and (C) bulk LDC.

The spectrum of the LDC (Figure 2C) shows an intense peak at 3218.85 cm–1 for the two N–H stretches coupled with two C=O attached
with INH and the stearoyl moiety. Additional peaks were seen at 2954.85
cm–1 for the aromatic C–H stretching and
at 1666.48 cm–1 for the C=O stretching attached
with the pyridine ring of INH. The peak at 1496.96 cm–1 correlates well with the one from 1492.58 cm–1 in INH for the aromatic C=C stretching, while the one at
1222.05 cm–1 is due to the aromatic C–N stretch
present at the pyridine ring of INH. A peak at 1792.47 cm–1 indicated C=O stretching attached with the long carbon chain
from the lipid, whereas the one at 2917.01 cm–1 represents
the alkane C–H stretch present at the long chain. No peaks
were observed for C–Cl stretching and primary amine N–H
stretching at 720.73 cm–1 and 3107.16 cm–1, respectively, as seen in the spectra for pure INH, indicating successful
covalent bonding. Furthermore, an intense peak corresponding to the
merging of N–H stretching (3218.85 cm–1)
and the presence of two C=O peaks with the shifting of the
C=O peak (1666.48 and 1792.47 cm–1) confirms
the formation of an amide bond between INH and SC, thereby substantiating
the formation of the LDC.

2.1.3 Proton NMR
The
proton NMR spectra
of pure INH, pure SC, and bulk LDC are presented in Figure 3. The spectrum for INH, as
presented in Figure 3A, shows a characteristic peak at a δ-value of 8.6 for the
aromatic protons bound to the 2C atom, which is coupled with the nitrogen
atom of the aromatic ring. The intensity of the peak was found to
be 2, indicating the presence of two hydrogen atoms associated with
this 2C atom. The peak at a δ-value of 7.6 and a peak intensity
of 2 represent two aromatic protons bound to the carbon atoms present
at the meta position of the aromatic ring.

Figure 3 Proton NMR spectra of
(A) pure INH, (B) pure SC, and (C) bulk LDC.

For pure SC (Figure 3B), a peak at a δ-value of 0.88 was observed for the CH3 proton of SC present at the end of the long chain, while
the peak at a δ-value of 2.88 was representative of the CH2 protons coupled with C–O bonding. A peak at a δ-value
of 1.706 may be attributed to the CH2 protons coupled with
the C3 atom of the stearoyl moiety. The peak at a δ-value of
1.318 can be attributed to the CH2 protons from C4 to C17
of the stearoyl chloride chain.

For the synthesized stearoyl–isoniazid
LDC (Figure 3C), the
peak at a δ-value
of 8.756 is analogous to that seen at a δ-value of 8.6 in the
INH spectra, as discussed above. Similarly, the peak at a δ-value
of 7.6 is the same as that described above, arising from the protons
of the INH aromatic ring. The peak at a δ-value of 0.85 corresponds
to the peak at 0.88 seen in the SC spectrum above. The peaks at δ-values
of 2.178 and 1.542 arise from the CH2 protons coupled with
C–O bonding and the following CH2 protons from the
C3 atom of the stearoyl moiety, respectively. The peak at a δ-value
of 1.193 arises from the CH2 protons present in the SC
chain. The peak at a δ-value of 9.938 indicates the presence
of N–H protons coupled with the C=O group of the isoniazid
molecule. The characteristic peak at a δ-value of 10.588 indicates
the presence of N–H protons, thereby confirming the formation
of an amide bond between the aromatic INH and aliphatic stearic acid.
A comparison of the three spectra, therefore, provides confirmation
of an amide bond formation between the lipid and drug to produce the
desired product (stearoyl–isoniazid conjugate).

2.1.4 Mass Spectroscopy
Mass spectra
of pure INH and bulk LDC are presented in Figure 4. These spectra show intense (M + H)+ peaks at 138.011 and 404.287, reflecting molecular weights
of INH (Figure 4A)
and LDC (Figure 4B),
respectively. This compares well with the reported molecular weight
of 137.139 for INH, as mentioned in the monograph, and the theoretical
molecular weight of 403 of the new compound. There was no major fragmentation
of the compound as a soft ionization technique was used for estimating
the molecular weight. The result reflects the success of the conjugation
reaction, and the formation of the LDC with the amide bond is thus
confirmed.

Figure 4 Mass spectroscopy of (A) pure INH and (B) bulk LDC.

2.1.5 Percentage Conjugation Efficiency and Percentage
Yield Estimation
On the basis of the formulae described earlier,
the percentage conjugation efficiency and percentage yield values
obtained for the bulk LDC are 92.73% (±6.31) and 92.01% (±3.08),
respectively.

2.2 Characterization of LDC-NPs
2.2.1 Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)
AFM
tapping mode showed both planar images (Figure 5A) and 3D images (Figure 5B) in terms of LDC-NP height. The images
show that the LDC-NPs have a smooth surface and a maximum height of
140 nm. Some earlier reports have suggested that particle size might
increase due to flattening of lipid-based nanoparticles on mica sheets
after deposition.24,25 However, in our observations,
the surface morphology of LDC-NPs appears unaffected and the image
appears to provide a realistic rendering of the particles.

Figure 5 LDC-NPs: (A)
planar AFM image, (B) 3D AFM image, (C) transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) image of LDC-NPs, (D) particle size distribution
of LDC-NPs, and (E) ζ-potential value of LDC-NPs.

2.2.2 Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)
Additional investigation of the surface morphology of LDC-NPs was
performed by TEM analysis. Figure 5C represents the TEM image of LDC-NPs, which shows
that the particles are discrete, spherical, smooth, nonaggregated,
and uniformly sized, ranging from 100 to 200 nm. This showed good
correlation with the particle size obtained from the dynamic light
scattering (DLS) analysis. The presence of nonaggregated, discrete
particles also correlated well with the high negative ζ-potential
values reported above, suggesting that appropriate choices of lipid
and surfactant combinations have produced stable, disperse LDC-NPs.

2.2.3 Particle Size, Polydispersity Index (PDI),
and ζ-Potential
The LDC-NPs obtained were found to
have an average particle size of 124.60 ± 5.56 nm with a PDI
value of 0.443 ± 0.065 (Figure 5D) from the DLS analysis. The LDC-NPs are of the desired
size range of less than 200 nm and are relatively monodisperse. Further,
the average ζ-potential of these NPs was reported to be −26.6
± 4.91 mV (Figure 5E). From the literature, it is reported that a ζ-potential
of approximately −30 mV is optimal for ensuring maximum stability
of NPs in a dispersed medium, suggesting that the synthesized LDC-NPs
are likely to be stable in suspension.1

2.2.4 Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR)
ATR spectra (Figure 6A, bottom panel) of LDC-NPs showed intense peaks at 3212.30, 3010.72,
1602.97, 1706.01, 1497, 1222.21, and 2916.69 cm–1, analogous to those seen in the ATR spectra of INH (Figure 6A, top panel) and of bulk LDC
(Figure 2C). Moreover,
the peak at 3212.30 cm–1 for merging of N–H
stretching coupled with the amide bond and presence of two C=O
peaks with the shifting of the C=O peak confirms the amide
bond between INH and SC that previously substantiated the formation
of the bulk LDC. This indicates that there is no structural dissimilarity
in the matrix of the bulk LDC and the LDC-NPs after the homogenization
technique and confirms that the NPs obtained are in pure LDC form.

spectra of INH and LDC-NPs, and (B) X-ray diffraction (XRD)
images of INH and LDC-NPs.

2.2.5 X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRD)
XRD spectra
of pure INH and LDC-NPs are represented in Figure 6B. The XRD spectrum of pure
INH showed peaks at diffraction angles 2θ of 16.309, 19.136,
23.626, 24.980, 25.716, 26.776, 28.425, 33.801, 36.935, 38.215, and
39.529 (Figure 6B,
top panel). Again, the XRD spectrum of drug-loaded LDC-NPs showed
a decrease in the peak intensity as compared to that of pure drug,
indicating a decrease in crystallinity. However, the presence of INH
peaks in LDC-NPs at 19.428, 23.300, 24.287, and 26.732 suggests either
incorporation or conjugation of INH with SC (Figure 6B, bottom panel). The XRD spectrum of LDC-NPs
did not show any other abundant peaks of INH and also showed no major
peak shift, which suggested that there were no crystalline modifications
of the LDC during the nanoparticle preparation.

2.2.6 Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
DSC curves
of pristine INH (Figure 7, top panel) and LDC-NPs (Figure 7, bottom panel) showed endothermic peaks
at 171.43 and 124.37 °C, respectively, which reflect their respective
melting points. The sharp DSC peak of pristine INH indicates the crystalline
structure of the drug and also correlates well with that in the literature.26 DSC curves of the LDC-NPs showed two endothermic
peaks at 124.37 and 101.08 °C, whereas the corresponding endothermic
peak of INH was found to be absent. Thus, the appearance of the two
unrelated peaks, demonstrating a distinctly different heat capacity
as compared to that of the parent compounds, confirms the formation
of a new compound. The endothermic peaks of lyophilized LDC-NPs showed
altered endothermic peaks as compared to those of the pure drug, indicating
the thermal stability of the conjugate after conversion to nanoparticles.
The peak of the lipid component of LDC-NPs is slightly wider and slightly
greater at the melting point than the corresponding peak of the pure
lipid (data not shown), which indicates a more stable crystalline
form of the LDC.27

Panel) pure INH and (Bottom Panel) LDC-NPs.

2.2.7 Molecular Environment of LNF-NPs
Nile
red is a lipophilic fluorescent marker whose absorption bands
vary in shape, position, and intensity with the nature of the environment.
Nile red is highly soluble in organic solvents, such as acetone, and
strongly fluorescent in a lipophilic environment. As shown in Figure 8, samples demonstrated
an increasing trend of shift in emission wavelength as follows: NR
(603 nm) > SC (601 nm) > LDC (602.8 nm) > LDC-NPs (631 nm).
For samples
suspended in highly lipophilic solvents, such as Nile red in acetone,
and lipophilic samples, such as SC and LDC, in an aqueous medium,
the emission maxima were found to be near around 600 nm with high
fluorescence intensity. When incorporated into a nanoparticulate formulation,
the probable reorientation of the surrounding water molecules around
the LDC-NP surface led to emission shifts to longer wavelengths around
630 nm.

Figure 8 Fluorescence spectra of pure Nile red in acetone (red trace), and
stearoyl chloride (black trace), bulk LDC (green trace), and LDC-NPs
(blue trace) in an aqueous solution (1 ppm).

The lipophilicity also decreased following a decrease in the size
content of the formulations. It should be noted that the bulk LDC
(green line peaking at 601 nm), which is typically formulated as large
irregular flakes or microparticles, showed a higher intensity compared
with LDC-NPs (631 nm). A possible cause of the reduced intensity of
LDC-NPs is the aggregation of Nile red and its relocation to a less
nonpolar environment in the core of the nanoparticles. In contrast,
crystallization in the inner phase of the bulk LDC may have reduced
its capacity to accommodate foreign molecules and caused the expulsion
and aggregation of Nile red on the surface, reflecting the higher
signal intensity.

2.2.8 In Vitro Drug Release
from LDC-NPs
Figure 9 represents
comparative in vitro INH release from its solution and LDC-NPs (after
acid treatment) in simulated intestinal fluid (SIF) phosphate buffer
at pH 7.4. From the drug release profile, it is observed that INH
showed a monophasic release and was completely (99.65%) released from
solution within 4 h. In comparison, LDC-NPs showed a biphasic drug
release pattern; the formulation showed initial accelerated release
up to 12 h (60.65% of cumulative release), followed by sustained release
up to 72 h (97.97% of cumulative release). As such, although no burst-release
effect was observed, the release rate of the primary phase was considerably
faster than that of the steady release phase. The prolonged release
of INH from LDC-NPs may have been mediated by initial dissolution
of LDC molecules at the surface of LDC-NPs, followed by the cleavage
of the amide bond during acid treatment of the conjugate. A decrease
in the osmotic flux of the local environment over time and the corresponding
increase in lipophilicity of the solvent system may have also contributed
to the sustained release in the steady state.

profile of pure INH and INH from LDC-NPs
in SIF at pH 7.4.

2.2.9 Mechanism
of Drug Release Kinetics
As described earlier, the in vitro
release data were fitted into
various mathematical release kinetic models such as the zero-order
model, first-order model, Higuchi model, and Hixson–Crowell
model to determine the best-fit model on the basis of the regression
coefficient (r2) value. The r2 values for each of the models are presented in Table 1. As the maximum regression
coefficient of LDC-NPs was found to be 0.9929 in the Higuchi model,
plotted as cumulative % drug release versus square root of time, it
was concluded that INH release from LDC-NPs obeyed the Higuchi model
of diffusion kinetics.

2.3 Characterization
of in Vitro Safety, Uptake,
and Intracellular Trafficking
2.3.1 Cell Viability Assay
In this study,
the evaluation of the toxicity of LDC-NPs and INH was evaluated using
the alamarBlue assay; alamarBlue or resazurin provides weak fluorescence,
until it is metabolically reduced by healthy live cells to a pink
color and highly red fluorescent resorufin, which is detectable. Resazurin
is effectively reduced in mitochondria, making it useful also to assess
mitochondrial metabolic activity without any effect on the electron
transport chain. For more sensitive detection with low cell numbers,
we increased the incubation time up to 24 h. The experimental outcome
indicates minimal toxicity from the LDC-NPs even at relatively high
doses used in the cell viability study (Figure 10).

of the human differentiated
monocytes THP-1.

2.3.2 Internalization
of LDC-NPs in THP-1 Cells
To establish preliminary uptake
and localization of LDC-NPs in
human macrophages, coumarin-6-tagged formulations were incubated with
phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-differentiated human macrophage-like
THP-1 cells. For this purpose, LDC-NPs containing the fluorescent
label coumarin-6 were tested at 75 μg/mL at 37 °C for 4
h. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was used to stain nucleus
while rhodamine phalloidin was used to stain actin filaments and cell
membranes in podosomes and membrane projections of cells, respectively
(Figure 11, top row).
Confocal microscopy provided preliminary confirmation of internalization
of LDC-NPs in macrophages. Colocalization of green fluorescence with
rhodamine phalloidin suggested that the nanoparticles were well distributed
in the cytoplasm.

2.3.3 Fluid-Phase Endocytosis of LDC-NP in THP-1
Cells
Fluid-phase endocytosis regulates a range of physiological
functions and trafficking of endosomes, which carry the nanoparticles
into intracellular compartments. To identify the alteration in membrane
dynamics, we used pHrodo Red dextran that can stain the early endosome,
while also trafficking with endosomal maturation to finally accumulate
in the lysosomal compartment. The concentration of pHrodo Red dextran
in the endosomal compartment is directly correlated with the endocytic
uptake in THP-1 cells. It has been well established that anionic lipid
formulations are less toxic than cationic ones.28 Cationic liposomes can cause cytotoxicity, through mitochondrial
depolarization, generating reactive oxygen species, releasing cytochrome
c, caspase-3, and caspase-8, limiting their safety for clinical use.29 In the present study, we developed anionic LDC-NPs
to facilitate better uptake with minimal toxicity in differentiated
macrophages.30,31 Our experimental design for evaluating
endocytosis of coumarin-6-tagged LDC-NPs with pHrodo Red dextran with
THP-1 cells (Figure 11) elucidated the mechanism of increased uptake of LDC-NPs in a time-dependent
manner. Confocal microscopy confirmed that in as early as 1 h there
is significant uptake of LDC-NPs localized primarily at the cell membrane
(Figure 11, row 2).
Subsequently, there is a progressive internalization through the cell
membrane into the cytosol over 4 h (Figure 11, row 3), with increasing diffusion of signal
in the cytoplasm. After the initial uptake, LDC-NPs accumulated in
the endosomes over 24 h, as seen by the diffuse green signal throughout
the cytoplasm and colocalization of the LDC-NPs with the pHrodo Red
dextran staining (Figure 11, bottom row).

2.3.4 pH-Dependent Intracellular
Trafficking within
THP-1
Confocal scanning microscopic imaging was used to follow
the intracellular trafficking of coumarin-6-labeled LDC-NPs following
their uptake in differentiated THP-1 cells (Figure 12). ER-Tracker Red and LysoTracker Red D99
dyes, which are highly selective for acidic organelles, were used
as pH-dependent markers of endosomal and lysosomal compartments, respectively.
After 4 and 24 h of incubation with coumarin-6-labeled LDC-NPs, significant
colocalization in both endosomal and lysosomal compartments was observed.

endosomal compartments at a fixed magnification scale.

As a majority of the bacteria reside in the arrested phagolysosomal
compartment during MTb infection, it is necessary to deliver the NPs
in this protease-rich acidic environment. Our data suggest that the
anionic hydrophobic core provided by LDC-NPs promotes their facile
uptake and subsequent trafficking deep into intracellular compartments.32 The in vitro drug release profile of the LDC-NPs
validates that the amide linkage between INH and the stearoyl moiety
can be cleaved at the lysosomal pH. This allows the release of the
INH from the LDC-NPs on reaching these low-pH environments and ensures
intracellular, pH-dependent delivery of INH to act against any pathogenic
bacteria residing in the phagolysosomal compartment.

2.3.5 Colocalization of LDC-NPs with Intravesicular
Compartmental Proteins
The effect of LDC-NPs on intracellular
trafficking was elaborately investigated by mimicking the survival
mechanism of MTb in the host cell. It is well established that MTb
residing in endosomes evades macrophage-mediated degradation by preventing
fusion of the endosome with the nascent phagosome, thereby arresting
subsequent acidification of early and late endosomes into phagolysosomal
pH.33 GTPases Rab5, Rab7, Rab11, Rab14,
and EEA1 are the main group of proteins that are expressed ubiquitously
on the surface of early and late endosomes. Among them, Rab11 and
EEA1 control the interaction of the nascent phagosome with the early
and recycling endosome through fusion–fission mechanisms. They
also control the MHC class-II maturation by the formation of early,
intermediate, late, and phagolysosomes.20,34−37 Hence, we chose to identify vesicles expressing Rab11 and EEA1,
as they connect with the nascent endocytic vesicles and control their
maturation to convert them into recycling vesicles.

As seen
in Figure 13 (rows
1 and 2), LDC-NPs effectively colocalized with fluorescently labeled
antibodies against Rab11 and EEA1, indicating that our delivery system
may be able to deliver INH into those intracellular compartments where
the MTb pathogen resides and replicates.38,39

green channel. (D) Merged imaging of all channels with respective
bleached pink and white coloration, signifying the colocalization
of LDC-NPs in early and recycling endosomal and lysosomal compartments,
respectively, at a fixed magnification scale.

The positive result from EEA1 and Rab11 colocalization encouraged
us to further observe a couple of tetraspanin superfamily proteins,
specifically CD63 and LAMP-2, that control different diversified cellular
mechanisms and represent characteristics of the late compartments
of the phagocytic route in differentiated macrophages. CD63 is well
distributed in the endosome, lysosome, phagolysosomal complex, and
trans-Golgi network.37 Similarly, LAMP-2
has direct recruitment in MTb-infected phagosomes to selectively fuse
with lysosomal vesicles and initiate the phagolysosome biogenesis.38,39 As seen in Figure 13, colocalization of coumarin-6-tagged LDC-NPs in CD63 (Figure 13, row 3) and LAMP-2
(Figure 13, row 4)
labeled vesicles confirms the presence of LDC-NPs with these intravesicular
compartmental proteins, which indicate that they are well distributed
to target MTb even in the phagolysosomal fusion process.

2.3.6 Quantization of Intracellular Colocalization
of LDC-NPs
Quantitative densitometry was used to quantify
the green fluorescence from uptake of coumarin-6-labeled LDC-NPs by
THP-1 cells. These values were compared to fluorescence signals from
pHrodo Red dextran from actin staining (Figure 14A), ER-Tracker Red staining of endosomes,
LysoTracker Red D99-labeled lysosomes (Figure 14C), and fluorescently labeled antibodies
against CD63, LAMP-2, Rab11, and EEA1 (Figure 14D). The results confirm the initial deposition
of LDC-NPs on the cell membrane within 1 h, followed by subsequent
cytosolic dispersion between, which appears to peak at 24 h (Figure 14A). Localization
of the nanoparticles in the endosomal and lysosomal compartments appears
to remain consistent between 4 and 24 h, even as the pH-activated
fluorescence of the ER-Tracker and LysoTracker dyes increases with
the progressive decrease in the intravesicular pH of the corresponding
vesicles over this time interval (Figure 14B,C). Finally, significantly high values
of green fluorescence with all fluorescently tagged antibodies evaluated
in this study confirm the ability of this delivery system to colocate
within the key intracellular compartments that the invading MTb pathogen
is likely to reside in (Figure 14D).

3 Conclusions
In this investigation,
a novel lipid–drug conjugate of INH
with SC was prepared by amide bond formation and was confirmed by
TLC, NMR, ATR, and mass spectroscopy analysis. A cold high-pressure
homogenization technique was employed to transform the synthesized
bulk LDC into LDC-NPs, which were stabilized by aqueous surfactant
mixtures. AFM and TEM images of the LDC-NPs exhibited discrete, spherical,
smooth, nonaggregated, and uniformly sized particles, which agreed
well with the particle size obtained from DLS measurements. Our LDC-NPs
had an average particle size of 124.60 (±5.56) nm with a PDI
value of 0.443 (±0.065); a ζ-potential value of −26.6
mV (±4.91) indicated that the formulation is likely to remain
stable in suspension. ATR, DSC, XRD, mass spectroscopy, and fluorescence
spectroscopy all confirmed the successful conjugation of the drug
to the lipid moiety and revealed the integrity of formulation. In
vitro drug release studies of optimized LDC-NPs showed biphasic release
behavior with an initial phase of accelerated release followed by
sustained release (97.97%) for 72 h; LDC-NPs obeyed the Higuchi model
of drug release kinetics. These results are encouraging as the robustness
of the synthesis scheme and the formulation has been validated by
multiple analytical methods. Cell viability assessed by alamarBlue
reduction assay indicated the safety of the LDC-NP formulation even
at relatively high doses. The increased lipophilicity and the anionic
surface charge of the LDC-NPs appeared to facilitate rapid uptake
and uniform cytosolic distribution in THP-1 cells. In continuation
of the above, confocal imaging also confirmed that the particles were
progressively localized inside THP-1 macrophages. The uptake and intracellular
journey of LDC-NPs were initiated through bulk-phase endocytosis by
the formation of coated vesicles, as identified by pHrodo Red dextran
staining (Figure 11). Further colocalization of LDC-NPs with ER-Tracker Red (Figure 12), EEA1, and Rab11
(Figure 13) indicates
the continuing downstream movement of LDC-NPs in early, late, and
recycling endosomes, with subsequent transport into the lysosomal
and phagolysosomal complexes.

Quantification of fluorescence
from these colocalized LDC-NPs (Figure 14) also indicates
the stability of the LDC-NPs at a lysosomal pH and their ability to
provide sustained release in these intracellular compartments over
significantly longer durations. Further, colocalization of LDC-NPs
with various compartmental proteins involved in MTb’s intracellular
host response maturation process demonstrated their potential to facilitate
drug delivery to the desired intracellular compartments inhabited
by this evasive pathogen. Figure 15 partially summarizes the intracellular trafficking
pathway for this novel INH delivery construct as uncovered thus far
by this study. Further investigations are needed to determine the
eventual intracellular fate of these LDC-NPs, including the time course
of complete degradation and, most importantly, potential interaction
with intracellular pathogens. Together, these promising results indicate
the significant potential and justify further exploration of INH-loaded
LDC-NPs for the treatment of intransigent extrapulmonary infections,
such as TB meningitis, where the hydrophilicity of pure INH may pose
a severe limitation in crossing the blood–brain barrier. However,
broader in vivo investigations of the safety and efficacy of this
new formulation are necessary before translation into clinical use.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
SC, INH, N,N′-dimethylacetamide (N-DMA), pyridine, Tween
80, Poloxamer-188 solution, sodium hydroxide,
potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate, dialysis bags having a molecular
weight cutoff (MWCO) of 12 000 Dalton, and Nile red dye were
all procured from Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals, St. Louis. High-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade solvents such as water, chloroform,
methylene chloride, and methanol were obtained from Merck Specialties
Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai, India. All chemicals and solvents were of HPLC
and analytical reagent grade and were used as received. Double-distilled
water was used throughout the experiment.

4.2 Synthesis
of Bulk LDC
The hydrophilic
drug, INH, was converted to an amphiphilic prodrug by conjugating
its free amino group with a free chloride group of SC to form a stearoyl–INH
LDC stabilized by an amide linkage,40−42 as per the reaction
scheme given in Figure 1A. SC was used instead of stearic acid because the chloride group
is considered to be a better leaving group in comparison with the
hydroxyl group, and it reacts easily with the amino group of INH to
form an amide bond. In this synthesis, N-DMA was used as a solvent
and pyridine as a catalyst to accelerate the reaction. Briefly, SC
was reacted with INH in an equimolar ratio in the presence of N-DMA
and pyridine under magnetic stirring at 500 rpm at room temperature
for 3–4 h. This was followed by the addition of an excess quantity
of water to quench the reaction to form the bulk stearoyl–INH
LDC. After quenching the reaction, the reaction mixture was filtered
by vacuum filtration and thoroughly washed with water for the complete
removal of N-DMA, pyridine, and unreacted reactants (INH and SC),
as they are all soluble in water. Further, the obtained bulk LDC product
was air-dried overnight and was stored at 4 °C until further
analysis.

4.3 Characterization of Bulk LDC
4.3.1 TLC
TLC studies were carried out
for the primary confirmation of the formation of the desired product
after the conjugation process. This was done by spotting INH (after
solubilizing it in water), LDC, and SC (solubilized in chloroform)
with the help of a capillary on silica gel plates using chloroform:methanol
(75:25) as a mobile phase. TLC plates were observed under UV light
to confirm the completion of the conjugation reaction.43

4.3.2 ATR Analysis
Fourier transform
infrared analysis of pure INH, pure SC, and the conjugated product
was performed in the ATR mode on a Tensor-27 spectrophotometer (Bruker,
India) scanning within an IR range of 4000–400 cm–1, as reported previously in the literature.44

4.3.3 NMR Spectroscopy
The proton NMR
spectra of pure INH, pure SC, and stearoyl–INH LDC were obtained
using an Ascend 400 NMR spectrometer (Bruker, India) and were used
to determine the structural configuration and presence of hydrogen
environment of the conjugated compounds as previously reported.45 For this purpose, pure INH was dissolved in
deuterated water (D2O), pure SC in deuterated chloroform
(CDCl3), and LDC in deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (deuterated
DMSO).

4.3.4 Mass Spectroscopy
Matrix-assisted
lased desorption/ionization mass spectroscopy of pure INH and stearoyl–INH
LDC was obtained using an AB SCIEX TOF/TOF 5800. The experiment was
performed by dissolving pure INH in methanol and LDC in a mixture
of chloroform and methanol to determine the exact molecular weight
of the compounds by the soft ionization technique, as reported previously
in the literature.46

4.3.5 Percentage Conjugation Efficiency and Percentage
Yield Estimation
The percentage conjugation efficiency was
determined by measuring the absorbance of unconjugated INH in aqueous
washings using a UV spectrophotometer (UV-1700, Shimadzu, Japan) at
261 nm, after confirming that all other components of the reaction
mixture and their byproducts did not interfere with the analysis of
INH.43

The percent yield of the bulk
LDC was calculated as a percentage of the total amounts of lipid and
INH employed during preparation. The percentage yield of the bulk
LDC was calculated using the following formula47 1  

4.4 Preparation of LDC-NPs
The bulk LDC
obtained in the previous step was further formulated as LDC-NPs by
adopting a previously reported cold HPH technique48 and using a high-shear homogenizer (T-25 Digital Ultra-Turrax,
IKA India Pvt. Ltd., India). The previously synthesized and air-dried
bulk LDC was dispersed by magnetic stirring at 4 °C in an aqueous
solution containing 0.5% w/v Tween 80 and 1.0% w/v Polaxomer 188 as
surfactants. This cold aqueous LDC dispersion was further homogenized,
using a high-shear homogenizer at 8000 rpm for 10 min, to produce
LDC-NPs. The dispersion of homogenized LDC-NPs was kept at −80
°C overnight and then lyophilized in a lyophilizer (Coolsafe,
Labogene, Denmark) for 48 h to obtain freeze-dried LDC-NPs. Finally,
the freeze-dried LDC-NPs were stored at 4 °C until further analysis.

For in vitro characterization and future biological studies, two
different dye-labeled versions of the nanoparticle formulation, namely,
Nile red (0.1% w/w) and coumarin-6 (0.1%w/w)-labeled LDC-NPs, respectively,
were also synthesized. For this purpose, these dyes were added (0.05%w/v)
after LDCs were melted at 125 °C and homogenized further at 8000
rpm for 10 min for the production of dye-labeled LDC-NPs.

4.5 Characterization of LDC-NPs
4.5.1 Particle
Size, PDI, and ζ-Potential
LDC-NPs were evaluated for
mean particle size (Z-average), PDI,
and ζ-potential by dynamic light scattering (DLS) using a Zetasizer
(Nano ZS-90, Malvern Instruments, U.K.). Distilled water was used
as a dispersion medium and a 1:99 w/v dilution of the lyophilized
LDC-NPs was freshly made before analysis. The surface charge and stability
of the LDC-NP systems in suspension was evaluated by ζ-potential
values.

4.5.2 AFM
AFM images of LDC-NPs were
recorded with an AFM microscope (Nano Wizard 3, Zeiss, Germany) to
confirm the structural and topographical characteristics of these
novel particles. For sample preparation, freeze-dried LDC-NPs were
first dispersed in double-distilled water using bath sonication. The
dispersion was spread as a thin film on the surface of a mica sheet
and air-dried for 24 h under vacuum. The samples were then analyzed
using a silicon nitrile probe in the tapping mode for visualizing
the particles.

4.5.3 TEM
Particle
morphology in terms
of sphericity, aggregation, and electronic environment of the developed
LDC-NPs was examined by high-resolution TEM (JEM-2100, Jeol, Japan).
Samples were stained with phosphotungstic acid (PTA, 2%, 5 min and
excess PTA removed), spread on a gold grid, and examined.

4.5.4 ATR
Drug–excipient interaction
studies were performed by ATR analysis (Tensor-27, Bruker, Germany).
Samples of pristine drugs, pure SC, bulk LDC, and LDC-NPs were all
studied. The samples were subjected to spectral scanning in the wavenumber
range of 4000–400 cm–1 at a resolution of
4 cm–1 and scan speed of 2 mm/sec.

4.5.5 DSC
Thermal data analyses of DSC
thermograms of pristine drugs and LDC-NPs were recorded on a differential
scanning calorimeter (DSC-60, Shimadzu, Japan). Samples were weighed
accurately (5 mg) in aluminum pans and heated at a predefined rate
of 20 °C per minute in the range of 10–350 °C. An
inert nitrogen atmosphere was maintained at a flow rate of 20 mL/min.

4.5.6 XRD
XRD patterns of pristine drugs
and LDC-NPs were collected using an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker AXS
D8 Advance, Germany) with Cu Kα radiation generated at 40 mA
and 35 kV. The diffraction angle 2θ was recorded from 1°
to 40°/min with a scanning speed of 1°/min to estimate the
crystallinity of the samples.

4.5.7 Molecular
Environment of LDC-NPs
The lipophilic fluorescent marker,
Nile red, was used as the model
solute, and the molecular environment (polarity) was elucidated by
fluorometric spectroscopy based on the solvatochromism of the dye.
For this purpose, LDC-NPs with 1 ppm Nile red were prepared as described
earlier. Emission fluorescence spectra of Nile red dye-loaded LDC-NPs
were recorded with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi F-7000
FL, Tokyo, Japan) at room temperature with both slit widths set to
5 nm. The excitation wavelength was fixed at 546 nm, and the emission
spectra were recorded from 550 to 700 nm at a scanning speed of 240
nm/min.49

4.5.8 In
Vitro Drug Release Study
The
in vitro release of INH from LDC-NPs was determined by quantifying
diffusion of the released drug through a dialysis membrane50 using an 8-station, automated dissolution test
apparatus (Disso-8, Lab India, Mumbai, India). To simulate in vivo
gastric conditions, the study was performed in simulated intestinal
fluid (SIF, phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) as a dissolution test medium,
using a dialysis membrane with a MWCO of 12 000 Da, activated
by soaking in SIF for overnight. An aliquot of 100 mg of LDC-NPs was
placed inside the dialysis bag, which was then clipped at both ends.
The dialysis bag was fully immersed in 500 mL of dissolution test
medium in one station of the dissolution test apparatus. Stirring
was maintained at 100 rpm, at 37 °C (±0.2 °C) for the
entire duration of the study. Sampling was done by extracting aliquots
of 3 mL each at pre-set time intervals (15, 30, 45 min, 1, 2, 4, 6,
8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h). The sample volume extracted was immediately
replaced by an equal volume of fresh dissolution medium to maintain
sink conditions. Aliquot samples were further treated with 0.1 N hydrochloric
acid and centrifuged in 1.5 mL tubes (1.5 mL MCT) at 1000 rpm for
5 min to collect the supernatant.51 This
was done to initiate acid hydrolysis of the lipid conjugate and to
release the drug in the solution. This protocol simulates the degradation
process due to the acid environment present in the secretory and endocytic
pathways.52 This supernatant, expected
to contain the drug cleaved from the released LDC molecules, was then
analyzed using a UV spectrophotometer (UV 8+, Thermo Scientific Pvt.
Ltd., Mumbai, India) at 262 nm. The cumulative percentage of drug
released at different intervals of time was compared to a standard
calibration curve of various concentrations of INH generated on the
same instrument. The release of pure INH inside the dialysis membrane
was also performed in the same manner, albeit without treatment of
aliquots with acid.

4.5.9 Mechanism of Drug Release
Kinetics
The mathematical modeling of drug release kinetics
from LDC-NPs was
performed by applying various known models of release kinetics to
the data values obtained experimentally. The best fit of the experimental
data was selected after fitting to the following equations: Zero-order equation
(cumulative percentage drug release vs time):
2  where Qt is the
amount of drug released in time t, Q0 is the initial amount of drug in the solution (most
times, Q0 = 0), and k0 is the zero-order release rate.53 First-order equation (log cumulative percentage drug remaining
to be released vs time):
3  where Qt is the amount of drug released
in time t, Q0 is the
initial amount of drug in the solution,
and k1 is the first-order release rate
constant.54 Higuchi equation:
4  where Qt is the
amount of drug released at time t, and K is the Higuchi diffusion rate constant.55 Hixson–Crowell equation:
5  

4.5.10 Statistical Analysis
Graph Pad
Instat Software (Graph Pad Software, version 3.05, San Diego, CA)
was used for statistical analysis. All experimental data were reported
as mean values with one standard deviation.

4.5.11 In
Vitro Cell Culture Studies
A human monocyte cell line, THP-1,
was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin/gentamycin/amphotericin
B. To transform the cells into macrophages, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate
(PMA) was used at a concentration of 200 nM for differentiation. After
24 h, differentiated cells were dosed with coumarin-6-labeled LDC-NPs,
and the plates were incubated in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at
37 °C for different time intervals.56,57

4.5.12 Cell Viability Assay
Toxicity
of LDC-NPs in PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells was assessed using an
alamarBlue (Invitrogen) reduction assay. Typically, 100 μL of
cells (2 × 105 cells/well) were seeded in 96-well
plates with a serial dilution of LDC-NPs of 5, 25, 50, and 70 μg/mL
in RPMI-1640 for a period of 24 h. After incubation with the test
LDC-NP for 24 h, medium in all wells was replaced with fresh medium
(100 μL) containing alamarBlue (10 μL). After 48 h following
the initial addition of LDC-NPs and a further 24 h incubation in alamarBlue
for more readout sensitivity, measurements of reduction of alamarBlue
were taken as absorbance readings following excitation at 570 and
emission at 595 nm using a microplate reader.

4.5.13 Internalization of LDC-NPs in THP-1 Cells
through Confocal Microscopy
PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells
were grown on 12-well plates containing poly-d-lysine-coated
sterile coverslips of 12 mm diameter (Corning BioCoat). After 4 h
of incubation with LDC-NPs, the cells were washed and fixed before
staining cytosolic actin filaments with rhodamine phalloidin. For
staining, 5 μL of the 6.6 mM methanolic stock rhodamine phalloidin
solution was diluted up to 200 μL in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) with 1% bovine serum albumin before applying to each coverslip.
Cells were then incubated for 45 min in the dark, following which
cells were rinsed two times with 10 mM PBS. Cell-containing coverslips
were air-dried, mounted with ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) with DAPI on a one-end frosted glass slide (Corning,
Germany), and their fluorescence was observed and recorded on fluorescein
isothiocyanate and tetramethylrhodamine channels under a confocal
microscope (FV 3000, Olympus, Germany).

4.5.14 Fluid-Phase
Uptake of LDC-NP in THP-1 Cells
PMA-differentiated THP-1
cells were incubated with LDC-NPs (75
μg/mL) and 50 ng/mL of pHrodo Red dextran (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
for varying time periods of 1, 4, and 24 h. Coverslips were fixed
and mounted with ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
with DAPI on a one-end frosted glass slide as before, and their fluorescence
was observed and recorded on a confocal microscope (FV 3000, Olympus,
Germany).

4.5.15 pH-Dependent and Antibody-Mediated
Intracellular
Trafficking with THP-1
To study whether nanoparticles were
internalized into the differentiated macrophages and simultaneously
delivered into the lysosomal compartment, we seeded human differentiated
macrophages on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and incubated
the cells with coumarin-6-labeled LDC-NPs for 4 and 24 h at 37 °C
in 5% CO2. To determine the uptake of coumarin-6-labeled
LDC-NPs in the lysosomal compartment of differentiated macrophages,
we incubated macrophages with 50 nM LysoTracker Red D99 (Molecular
Probes) or ER-Tracker Red (BODIPY, Molecular Probes) and with primary
antibody against CD63 (Origene, TA802751), LAMP-2 (Origene, TA336932),
EEA1 (BD Bioscience, 610456), and Rab11 (ST John, STJ111613) at 37
°C for 2 h. The methodology of staining was elaborated previously.58−60

4.5.16 Quantitative Densitometry of Intracellular
Trafficking with THP-1
Quantitative densitometry of LDC-NPs
dosed to THP-1 was performed to correlate with fluorescence from pHrodo
Red dextran, LysoTracker Red D99, ER-Tracker, and fluorescently labeled
antibodies to Rab11, EEA1, CD63, and LAMP-2. Each experiment was performed
in triplicate. The data are represented as mean ±SD and statistically
analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni multiple tests.
