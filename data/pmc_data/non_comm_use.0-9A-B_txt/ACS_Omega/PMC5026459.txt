It is commonly agreed
that the crystalline structure of seeds dictates
the crystallinity of final nanoparticles in a seeded-growth process.
Although the formation of monocrystalline particles does require the
use of single-crystal seeds, twin planes may stem from either single-
or polycrystalline seeds. However, experimental control over twin-plane
formation remains difficult to achieve synthetically. Here, we show
that a careful interplay between
kinetics and selective surface passivation offers a unique handle
over the emergence of twin planes (in decahedra and triangles) during
the growth over single-crystalline gold nanoparticles of quasi-spherical
shape. Twinning can be suppressed under conditions of slow kinetics
in the presence of silver ions, yielding single-crystalline particles
with high-index facets.

Introduction
The mechanistic understanding
of the emergence of twin planes is
of great importance in nanoparticle synthesis because the presence
of defects can alter the physical properties of nanostructures, thereby
opening new avenues toward the design of novel systems.1−7 Recently, experimental monitoring of twin emergence has attracted
the attention of several research groups. For example, Mirkin and
co-workers showed that single-crystalline gold nanoparticles can develop
twin defects during their growth with silver, to yield core–shell
nanoparticles with a twinned structure.8 Although the initial single-crystal particles used in their work
were prepared by conventional surfactant-assisted methods, the emergence
of twin planes originated from the photochemical reduction of silver
in the presence of additives that are not commonly used in established
methods. Thus, the need for further experimental advancement is more
than justified, which will not only ensure generalization of the current
growth models but also open up opportunities for new synthetic pathways
and crystal diversity at the nanoscale.

It is commonly agreed
that reaction kinetics and selective surface
passivation are the primary factors behind nanoparticle growth mechanisms.9,10Kinetic effects dominate at high rates of metal
reduction and usually result in thermodynamically unstable products
(displaying high-index facets). On the contrary, at slow reduction
rates, thermodynamically more stable particles, which display low-index
facets, emerge. Selective surface passivation, on
the other hand, involves the use of chemical additives. Silver ions
(Ag+) are known to bind preferentially onto certain gold
facets, which can result in anisotropic crystal growth through the
well-known underpotential deposition (UPD) mechanism. UPD occurs under
conditions of seed-mediated synthesis in which ascorbic acid (AA)
cannot reduce Ag+ in bulk, thereby facilitating the formation
of a silver (sub)monolayer on a gold surface and hindering further
deposition of Au atoms. As a result, particle growth slows down, affecting
the final nanoparticle shape and crystalline structure. At high Ag+ concentrations, seeded growth has been reported to lead to
anisotropic shapes with high-index facets.11 Although these design considerations—kinetic- and surface-controlled
growth—were established from single-crystalline nanoparticles,
further experimental work is required to understand how twinned structures
fit within this context.12

Results and Discussion
We define experimental conditions for the emergence of twin planes
during the overgrowth of single-crystalline nanoparticles in a typical
seeded-growth synthesis. We observed that relatively fast kinetics
and high concentration of silver ions are crucial to forming twinned
particles (decahedra, triangles) with low-index facets from single-crystalline
seeds (10 nm). Our findings indicate that kinetic- and surface-controlled
growth does not necessarily apply to the formation of twinned particles,
as recently proposed for single-crystalline analogues.

It is
well known that very small seeds can significantly change
in solution because of the spontaneous ripening processes at room
temperature.13 We, therefore, decided to
use larger seeds, which are more stable but still maintain a single-crystalline
structure. By following a protocol recently reported by Xia’s
group,14 we synthesized 10.0 ± 0.3
nm spherical particles in the presence of the cationic surfactant
cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) and AA (reducing agent). Detailed
inspection of the nanocrystals obtained using high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM) revealed that 93% of the particles were
monocrystalline (Figures 1 and 2d). Importantly, extended storage
of the 10 nm nanoparticles in the surfactant solution did not affect
the particle size, suggesting higher stability than their 3 nm analogues
commonly used in seed-mediated synthesis.

Figure 1 Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) (a) and HRTEM (b) images
of single-crystalline gold nanoparticles used as seeds in overgrowth
experiments. The average diameter was 10.0 ± 0.3 nm; 93% were
single crystals, and 7% were polycrystalline.

the corresponding solutions are available in Figure S1.

Because our aim was to evaluate
the role of silver in selective
surface passivation and the emergence of twin planes, we tried to
keep our system as simple as possible, using chemicals that contain
chloride counterions only:11 the cationic
surfactant benzyldimethylhexadecylammonium chloride (BDAC), gold precursor
(AuCl4–), and hydrochloric acid (HCl).
Note that Cl– is the halide with the lowest binding
affinity to gold surfaces, as compared with bromide or iodide,15 which minimizes the risk of undesired symmetry
breaking in the growing particles. Therefore, the growth over the
crystals is dominated by the presence of Ag+.16 In a typical experiment, the solution containing
the initial nanoparticle seeds was mixed with a growth solution containing
AuCl4– (0.5 mM), AA (0.067 mM), BDAC
(100 mM), and different concentrations of silver nitrate (AgNO3) and HCl. The solution was stored at 30 °C for 2 h to
ensure complete reduction.

Mirkin and co-workers reported that
silver ions drive the formation
of single-crystal particles with high-index facets by adsorption on
the particle surface.9 We indeed confirmed
this when increasing the concentration of silver nitrate up to 0.04
mM. The resulting particles had the shape of concave cubes (Figure 2b). Supported by
previous studies,10 we assume that these
particles are of single-crystalline nature. Overgrowth in the absence
of silver nitrate rendered nearly spherical nanoparticles, thus preserving
the shape of the initial seeds (Figure 2a). Interestingly, when increasing the Ag+ concentration to 0.12 mM, twinned nanoparticles were obtained with
either decahedral (34%) or triangular (66%) shapes. The absence of
spherical nanoparticles and the similar dimensions of triangles and
decahedra (46.8 ± 3.4 nm for decahedra; 47.9 ± 4.6 nm for
triangles) excluded a scenario involving the nucleation of new particles
away from the seed surface. We, therefore, postulate that the twinned
particles emerged from single-crystal seeds under these conditions.
To provide further arguments, we found that the volume of decahedra
and triangles is ∼70-fold higher than in the initial seeds.
Thus, the size of final particles that contained twin defects is sufficient
to accommodate 10 nm seeds between the boundaries of twin planes.

Interestingly, the formation of twinned particles from single-crystal
seeds can be suppressed by adding extra HCl. At a low HCl concentration
(2.5 mM), nanoparticles with a variety of poorly defined shapes formed
(Figure 3b). Further
increase in HCl concentration up to 19 mM rendered particles with
unconventional shapes (Figure 3c). High-resolution electron microscopy, electron diffraction,
and tomography confirmed the single-crystalline nature of the nanoparticles
prepared at higher HCl content (Figures 4, S2, and S3).
The morphology of these particles, with dominating high-index surface
facets, {311}, {110}, and {100}, is close to that of the truncated
ditetragonal prisms (DTP).17 UV–vis
spectroscopy showed that the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)
position blue-shifted from 620 to 555 nm when the amount of acid was
increased, suggesting the formation of more isotropic nanoparticles
(Figure 3e). We should,
however, note that, at a higher acid concentration, a new plasmon
band emerged at 846 nm. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis
revealed the presence of bipyramids (Figures S4 and S5). The population of bipyramids (∼10%) is in good
agreement with the initial population of twinned seeds.

Fourier transform, which confirms the monocrystalline structure.

The above results suggest that
the correct combination of HCl and
Ag+ as additives defines the shape and crystallinity of
the final particles. To better understand the role of additives in
the crystal growth, we evaluated the reduction kinetics for selected
experimental conditions. We carried out time-dependent UV–vis
analysis of the reactions during the formation of (1) spheres (no
Ag+, no HCl), (2) twinned nanoparticles with mixed shapes
(Ag+, no HCl), and (3) DTP nanoparticles (Ag+ and HCl). The results are summarized in Figure 5a. Whereas the formation of spheres was fast
(10 min), 70 min was needed to complete the reduction in the presence
of Ag+ (0.12 mM), which yielded twinned products. The presence
of both Ag+ and HCl slowed the kinetics further down so
that 160 min was required to obtain the final single-crystalline DTP
nanoparticles. Control experiments showed that the addition only of
acid yielded spherical single-crystalline nanoparticles (Figure S6), but when doubling the concentration
of AA—keeping HCl (0.19 mM) and Ag+ (0.12 mM) constant—we
could again obtain twinned particles (Figure S7). These results show that kinetics is, indeed, the main parameter
behind the formation of twinned particles, but only in the presence
of a surface passivation/stabilizing agent—silver ions.

We analyzed further the amount of silver ions and their distribution
in particles of different crystallinity. Mirkin and co-workers showed
that the number of Ag atoms that can deposit onto a particular facet
is equivalent to the number of surface atoms for that facet.11 Thus, it is possible to estimate the Ag/Au ratio
in nanoparticles of a given shape and crystallinity. Comparison of
the calculated Ag/Au ratio with the experimental one obtained by elemental
analysis using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Table S1) allowed us to estimate the silver incorporation
in the nanoparticles.

The surface energy of twinned particles
(decahedra, triangles)
is lower than that of DTPs. Twinned particles display low-index {111}
surface facets, with a greater number of exposed surface atoms than
higher-index facets in DTPs. We, thus, hypothesize that twinned nanoparticles
can accommodate a larger amount of silver atoms,9 which was confirmed by comparing the experimental and calculated
Ag/Au ratios for three different samples: (1) spheres prepared in
the absence of silver, (2) mixture of twinned nanoparticles, and (3)
DTPs (for theoretical estimation of the Ag/Au ratio, see Supporting Information). To our surprise, the
calculated and experimental Ag/Au ratios for twinned and DTP nanoparticles
are nearly identical and equal to 0.04 and 0.013, respectively (Figure 5b). The amount of
silver in the spherical nanoparticles is negligible (Ag/Au = 0.0003).
The relatively good agreement between the experimental and calculated
Ag/Au ratios suggests that (1) silver locates only on the surface
of the nanoparticles and (2) twinned nanoparticles (decahedra and
triangles) carry triple the amount of silver than single-crystalline
nanoparticles, which is related to their surface facets.

Figure 5 Kinetics and
surface passivation effects. (a) Kinetic traces for
three different samples, as labeled. (b) Ag/Au ratio for each particle
type, as obtained from ICP-MS analysis (grey), and estimated values
for monolayer coverage of Ag (red).

Next, we evaluate the effect of the particle size. It has
been
suggested that gold nanoparticles exhibit different structural motifs
and twinning as a function of particle size.18 Thus to evaluate the size effect, we used conventional seeds (1–3
nm) prepared by fast reduction with borohydride and subjected them
to overgrowth in the presence of Ag+ and/or HCl. We observed
a similar trend in the morphologies of the final products for smaller
seeds as those obtained using the 10 nm ones, but with less-defined
shapes. Twinned particles emerged in the presence of Ag, whereas single-crystal
particles were obtained in the presence of both Ag+ and
HCl (Figure S8). This finding, therefore,
shows that controlled twin engineering is possible for different size
ranges.

We also evaluated the influence of the nature of the
surfactant
as well as the counterion. For instance, it has been demonstrated
that the presence of bromide is essential for symmetry breaking in
the synthesis of gold nanorods. Thus, we evaluated the influence of
the surfactant by employing CTAC instead of BDAC. We again observed
a similar trend in the final products (twinned particles in the presence
of silver ions) by using CTAC in the growth solution (Figure S9). Interestingly, the surfactant counterion
clearly plays an important role. When the synthesis was performed
in cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), irregular shapes were obtained
regardless of the experimental conditions used (Figure S10).

We finally discuss the origin of twin planes.
Our results show
that when the Ag/Au ratio in the growth solution is 0.08, the particles
adopt a concave cubic shape. Silver UPD has been proposed as a key
mechanism to control the final nanoparticle shape while retaining
the single-crystalline structure.11 When
the Ag/Au ratio is increased to 0.24, that is 3-fold higher, twinned
particles are formed (Figure 2c). This seems to indicate that Ag+ ions determine
the formation of twins under our experimental conditions: Ag+ (0.12 mM); Cl– (100 mM from BDAC). Note that the
formation of argentichloride ions19,20 (AgCl2–) and insoluble AgCl is favorable under
these conditions. It is, thus, reasonable to assume that small clusters
of silver chloride can coprecipitate on the surface of gold particles
during growth, facilitating the formation of defects. This reasoning
is supported by the fact that there is a low-energy barrier to the
formation of twin defects.21 Once the twin
is formed, the final morphology will be determined by a balance between
the surface energy and the elastic strain needed to form the non-space-filling
structure.22,23 Therefore, increasing the content
of low-energy {111} surface facets could also drive the formation
of twins by minimizing the overall surface energy. The previous assumption
is supported by the fact that an increase in chloride concentration
up to 19 mM produced a transition from twinned to single-crystalline
particles enclosed by high-index facets (Figure 3c). It has been reported that high chloride
concentrations increase the solubility of AgCl because the formation
of AgCln–(n+1) complexes becomes favorable.24 Such an increase in the solubility of silver chloride could inhibit
twin formation. Additionally, the presence of HCl reduces the reduction
kinetics. On the other hand,
twinned particles were also formed when doubling the concentration
of AA (keeping HCl constant) (Figure S7), thus supporting the kinetically controlled nature of the process.
Bearing all this in mind, we propose a mechanism in which, at low
pH and in the presence of Ag+ ions, the UPD mechanism dominates
the growth of the particles leading to a thermodynamically controlled
process.25 At high silver ion concentrations
in the absence of HCl, the higher pH increases the redox potential
of AA, favoring the reduction of the gold precursor, in such a way
that the process is kinetically controlled.

In the latter case,
we should also consider that the Ag/Au ratio in the final product
is 0.04, which corresponds to the estimated value of monolayer coverage
of Ag. Therefore, silver could be reduced on the gold surface via
the UPD mechanism, selectively stabilizing the {111} facets and the
entire structure by favoring twin formation.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we have determined the experimental conditions required
to obtain twinned nanoparticles with mixed shapes (decahedra, triangles),
using 10 nm spherical single-crystalline particles as seeds. We showed
that not only a fast reduction rate but also the presence of a surface
passivation agent—silver ions—is necessary to induce
the formation of twin planes. Our results open up possibilities for
stepwise monitoring of emerging twin planes on a single-particle level
that may contribute to further development of twin engineering at
the nanoscale.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
Gold(III)
chloride trihydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O), sodium
borohydride (NaBH4), AA, CTAC, BDAC, AgNO3,
and HCl were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. Milli-Q water
was used in all experiments.

Synthesis of 10 nm Single-Crystal Gold Nanoparticles14
Initial seeds were prepared by a reduction
of HAuCl4 (5 mL, 0.25 mM) with freshly prepared NaBH4 (0.3 mL, 10 mM) in an aqueous CTAC solution (100 mM). A brown
solution formed upon the addition of NaBH4. The mixture
was left undisturbed at 27 °C for 2 h to ensure complete decomposition
of NaBH4. An aliquot of the seed solution (0.11 mL) was
added to a solution containing CTAC (20 mL, 200 mM), HAuCl4 (20 mL, 0.5 mM), and AA (15 mL, 100 mM). The mixture was left undisturbed
at 27 °C for 30 min. The solution was then centrifuged (1 h,
14 500 rpm) to remove excess reagents and redispersed in water
to obtain a final concentration of gold, equal to 2 mM. The 10 nm
gold nanospheres were used as seeds in further growth experiments.

Main Synthesis
In a typical experiment, a solution
of 10 nm gold seeds (0.04 mL) was added under vigorous stirring to
an aqueous growth solution containing BDAC (10 mL, 100 mM), HAuCl4 (0.1 mL, 50 mM), and AA (0.075 mL, 100 mM), and desired amounts
of Ag+ or HCl (vide infra) at 30 °C. The mixture was
left undisturbed at 30 °C for 2 h. The solution was centrifuged
twice (6500 rpm, 30 min) to remove excess reagents and redispersed
in Milli-Q water.

Effect of Ag+ and HCl
To study the effect
of silver ions, additional experiments were performed in the presence
of different amounts of 10 mM AgNO3 (0.04 and 0.12 mL).
Similarly, to study the effect of HCl, additional experiments were
performed with 1 M HCl (0.025 and 0.19 mL) in the presence of Ag+ (0.12 mM).

Characterization
Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM)
images were obtained with a JEOL JEM-1400PLUS transmission electron
microscope operating at an acceleration of 120 kV. UV–vis spectra
were measured with an Agilent 8453 UV–vis spectrophotometer.
SEM images were obtained using a JEOL JSM-6700F FEG microscope operating
at 3.0 kV for secondary electron imaging. HAADF-STEM images and electron
tomography tilt series were acquired using a double aberration corrected
cubed FEI Titan 50-80 electron microscope operated at 200 kV. For
the reconstruction of the series, we used the SIRT algorithm, as implemented
in the ASTRA toolbox.
