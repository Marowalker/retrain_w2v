This study presents new Tröger’s
bases bearing glycosyl
moieties obtained from a copper-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition
reaction. The Tröger’s bases present absorption maxima
close to 275 nm related to fully spin and symmetry-allowed electronic
transitions. The main fluorescence emission located at 350 nm was
observed with no influence on the glycosyl moieties. Furthermore,
protein detection studies have been performed using bovine serum albumin
(BSA) as a model protein, and results have shown a strong interaction
between some of the compounds through a static fluorescence suppression
mechanism related to the formation of a glycoconjugate–BSA
complex favored by the glycosyl subunit. Moreover, docking was also
studied for better understanding the suppression mechanism and indicated
that the glycosyl and triazole moieties increase the affinity with
BSA.

Introduction
Tröger’s
bases are C2-symmetric chiral tetracyclic
molecules, bearing a methano-1,5-diazocine
ring system, disposed in a unique V-shaped twisted structure. In this
conformation, the two aryl rings are almost at a 90o dihedral
angle, as presented in Figure 1 for 2,8-bis(methyl)-6H,12H-(5,11)-methanodibenzo[b,f][1,5]diazocine
(1).

Figure 1 Structure of the Tröger’s base 1.

These molecules have been known
for more than a century, since
the first report from Tröger.1 Thereafter,
a number of applications in supramolecular chemistry have been proposed.
In this sense, the pioneering work from Wilcox2 reported the use of Tröger’s bases in molecular recognition
studies as a torsional molecular balance to quantify weak interactions
such as head–tail and CH−π, which have important
implications for the folding of proteins.3 Since these initial reports, different designs have been presented.4−11 For example, these molecules have been described as synthetic receptors
for carboxylic acids,12 terpenes,13 adenine and biotin,14 monovalent cations,15 optical sensing,16−18 and dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) applications.19 Similarly, polyaromatic arylated Tröger’s
bases20 and derivatives bearing heterocyclic
ring systems such as phenanthroline,21 naphthalimide,22 and acridine23 derivatives
have been studied in DNA interacalation. Additional applications include
chiral solvating agents,24 catalysts,25 ligands in metal complexes,26 new materials,27 and compounds
with biological activity.28 On the other
hand, Tröger’s bases bearing carbohydrates in their
structure have not received much attention in the literature, despite
the interesting properties that might arise from the introduction
of a sugar moiety into the supramolecular structure.29,30 Carbohydrates are naturally available and therefore usually abundant
and inexpensive.31 The polyoxygenated scaffold
of carbohydrates is a valuable source of functionality that has been
used to introduce a complexation or recognition site in a supramolecular
structure for diverse applications. In this sense, different chemosensors
for the detection of metals such as nickel(II),32,33 copper(II),34,35 zinc(II),36 silver(I),37 and protein-responsive
electrochemical sensors38 are found in
the literature.

In this way, herein are described new Tröger’s
base
scaffolds presenting different glycosyl moieties linked by the 1,2,3-triazole
core through copper-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition (Scheme 1).39 Additionally, their photophysical properties were also
studied using UV–vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. Furthermore,
fluorescence titration and docking have been performed using bovine
serum albumin (BSA) for association studies.

Scheme 1 Glycoconjugates Prepared
in This Work from Tröger’s
Base Scaffold
Results and Discussion
The first step of this investigation was the functionalization
of the Tröger’s base scaffold as presented in Scheme 2.40 All details can be found in the Supporting Information. The 2,8-bis-iodo derivative 2, obtained
by the reaction of 4-iodoaniline with paraformaldehyde under acidic
conditions, was reacted with trimethylsilylacetylene in a Pd-catalyzed
Sonogashira coupling to prepare the required alkyne needed for the
copper-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction.
The corresponding 2,8-bis-alkyne 3 was isolated in 95%
yield. In a second step, the copper-catalyzed azide–alkyne
cycloaddition using azides derived from d-xylose, d-galactose, and d-mannose was performed.41 It was found that the efficiency of the CuAAC reaction
was particularly dependent on the solvent probably due to solubility
issues. Glycoconjugate 4a was obtained by reaction of 3 with a d-xylose-derived azide, resulting in 66%
yield when the reaction was performed in a 2:1 mixture of t-butanol/water as the solvent. For the d-galactose-derived
azide, the best result was achieved in a binary mixture of dichloromethane/water,
and the corresponding product 4b was isolated in 61%
yield. On the other hand, when the azide derived from d-mannose
was used, the best result was obtained in dichloromethane/water to
produce the derivative 4c in 51% yield and the monofunctionalized
derivative (16% yield), which were readily separated by column chromatography.40

In order to improve the synthesis of 4c, it was decided
to separately perform the deprotection reaction and the CuAAC cycloaddition.
Thus, instead of adding TBAF to the reaction mixture in the CuAAC,
we first removed both TMS groups from 3 using potassium
carbonate in methanol/THF to afford the bis-terminal alkyne 5 in 92% yield. This compound was then subjected to the CuAAC
reaction, and the desired glycoproduct 4c was isolated
in 75% yield (Scheme 3).40

The
photophysical investigation of the synthesized Tröger’s
bases was performed by UV–vis absorption and steady-state and
time-resolved fluorescence emission spectroscopies, respectively.
The organic solvents with different dielectric constants (dichloromethane,
1,4-dioxane, ethyl acetate, ethanol, and acetonitrile) were used at
a concentration of 10–5 M. The absorption spectra
of 4a–c are presented in Figure 2. The experimental
data from UV–vis absorption spectroscopy are presented in Table 1.

a The concentration is presented in
10–5 M; λabs and λem are the absorption and emission maxima, respectively (nm); ε
is the molar absorptivity (104 M–1·cm–1), fe is the calculated
oscillator strength; ke0 is
the calculated radiative rate constant (109 s–1); τ0 is the calculated pure radiative lifetime
(ns); ΔλST is the Stokes shift (nm/cm–1); and ΦFL is the relative fluorescence quantum
yield.

The Tröger’s
bases 4a–c present absorption maxima
located around 275 nm with an almost absent
solvatochromic effect, as already observed in the literature.42 In addition, the maxima location also indicates
that the triazole moiety does not present effective conjugation with
the aromatic rings present in the Tröger’s bases, since
it is found that values are very close to the Tröger’s
bases framework without any substituent.29 A particular behavior in ethanol was observed, where the absorption
maxima blueshift is ∼10 nm due to specific solute-solvent interactions
afforded by this polar protic media.

The UV–vis absorption
results allowed obtaining ground-state
parameters, such as the rate constant for emission (ke0), the oscillator strength (fe), and the pure radiative lifetime τ0 applying eqs 1– 3.43,44 The respective values are summarized
in Table 1. 1   2   3  In these equations, ε
(M–1·cm–1) is the extinction
coefficient and ∫εdv̅ is the area
under the absorption curve from a plot of ε (M–1·cm–1) versus the wavenumber v̅ (cm–1), which corresponds to a single electron
oscillator. The rate constant (ke0) for emission can be related to ε using eq 2, where the absorption maxima v̅02 is presented in cm–1. In addition, the calculated pure radiative lifetime
τ0 can be obtained from the rate constant from eq 3. The molar absorptivity
coefficient ε values (104 L·mol–1·cm–1) and the calculated radiative rate constant
(ke0) (109 s–1) for all Tröger’s bases indicate spin
and symmetry-allowed electronic transitions, which could be related
to 1π → π*. Moreover, the radiative
lifetime show quite similar values (τ0 ≈ 1
ns), suggesting that after excitation, these structures populate the
same excited state, as already observed for different Tröger’s
bases.29

The normalized fluorescence
emission spectra of Tröger’s
bases 4a–c are presented in Figure 3, obtained by exciting
the compounds at the absorption maxima. The relevant data from this
characterization are also presented in Table 1.

Figure 3 Normalized steady-state fluorescence emission
spectra in solution
of the Tröger’s bases (a) 4a, (b) 4b, and (c) 4c at a concentration of ∼10–5 M.

The glycoconjugates show
a main fluorescence emission located around
350 nm, indicating that the glycosyl moieties do not present any role
on their excited-state photophysics. As already observed in the ground
state, a small positive solvatochromic effect was observed from 1,4-dioxane
to acetonitrile, showing that their dipole moments are larger in the
excited state than in the ground state (i.e., μe →
μg). Concerning the fluorescence quantum yields,
surprisingly higher values could be obtained for the glycoconjugates 4a–c (ΦFL ≈ 0.2)
if compared to the values from the simpler Tröger’s
base framework (ΦFL ≈ 0.06).29 This result indicates that the glycosyl moieties are not
efficient excited-state deactivation channels.

The excited-state
dynamics of the Tröger’s bases
was investigated by time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. The respective
curves are depicted in Figure 4. The residuals are presented in the Supporting Information, and the relevant data are summarized in Table 2. Moreover, the radiative
and nonradiative decay rate constants, kf and knr, respectively, were also estimated
from eqs 4 and 5.45,46 4  and 5  where τf is
the experimental fluorescence lifetime and ΦFL is
the fluorescence quantum yield. The fluorescence decay profiles indicated
a monoexponential fluorescence lifetime with values between 1.4 and
2.0 ns with good χ2 values. The solvent seems do
not significantly affect the fluorescence lifetime of these compounds.
In acetonitrile and 1,4-dioxane, it could be observed that the Tröger’s
base 4c has a decrease in the fluorescence rate constant
(kf) attributable to more effective nonradiative
processes due to this moiety in the Tröger’s base scaffold.
The nonradiative process showed to be higher for all compounds in
the studied solvents, as expected.

BSA presents well-known photophysics characterized
by an absorption
located around 280 nm and a fluorescence emission around 340 nm related
to the tryptophan residues.47 In this way,
to investigate the interaction between the Tröger’s
bases and BSA, its fluorescence quenching in the presence of 4a–c was studied. It is understood that
this quenching can be associated to different methods, such as molecular
rearrangements, energy transfer, excited-state reactions, ground-state
complex formation, and collisional deactivation.48 In this way, the variation of fluorescence intensity of
BSA in the presence of the compounds was measured using 280 nm as
the excitation wavelength. Figure 5 depicts the suppression experiment using compound 4b as the BSA quencher. It is worth mentioning that the interaction
studies with BSA were also performed for comparison with the Tröger’s
base 1 in order to evaluate the glycosyl moitey role
on the interaction between the Tröger’s bases and BSA.

Figure 5 Fluorescence
emission spectra (λexc = 280 nm)
of BSA (11 μM in PBS, pH 7.2) in the presence of different amounts
of (a) the Tröger’s base 1 and (b) 4b. The blank sample (0 μM) is BSA in the absence of
the Tröger’s base. The inset shows the fluorescence
intensity versus Tröger’s base concentration relation.

It could be observed that as the concentration
of the Tröger’s
bases increases, the fluorescence intensity of BSA decreases, which
already qualitatively indicates a significant interaction of these
compounds with BSA. However, it can also be observed that the methylated
Tröger’s base 1 (Figure 5a) does not present a linear relationship
(R2 = 0.941) over the entire range of
studied concentration. On the other hand, compound 4b shows a linear relation between the fluorophore concentration and
the BSA fluorescence intensity (R2 = 0.989).
In addition, the Tröger’s base 1 (Figure 5a) presented a lower
reduction in the fluorescence intensity of BSA (14%) than the glycoconjugate 4b (67%). We would like to highlight that the additional glycoconjugates 4a and 4c also presented linear correlations
with similar values in the fluorescence suppression of BSA (67 to
71%) (data not shown; see the Supporting Information), indicating that the carbohydrate moitey plays an important role
in the interaction with BSA.

In order to better investigate
the suppression mechamism between
the Tröger’s bases and BSA, additional experiments were
performed at different temperatures (25, 30, 35, and 40 °C) by
applying the Stern–Volmer relation presented in eq 6: 6  where F0 and F are the
fluorescence intensities of
BSA in the absence and presence of certain amounts of the Tröger’s
bases, respectively; Kq and KSV are the bimolecular suppression and Stern–Volmer
constants, respectively; and [Q] is the quencher concentration. In
this equation, Kq is related to the suppression
efficiency, and τ0 is the fluorophore lifetime in
the absence of the suppressor, with values around 10–8 s to biomolecules.49 The relevant data
are summarized in Table 3.

b 2,8-Bis(methyl)-6H,12H-(5,11)-methanodibenzo[b,f][1,5]diazocine (Figure 1).

It can be observed that the constants KSV and Kq independent on the temperature
present values higher than 1011 L·mol–1·s–1, which exceed the maximum value of 2.0
× 1010 L·mol–1·s–1 for the diffusion-controlled mechanism (dynamic quenching). Thus,
it can be considered in this study that the suppression can be related
to a static mechanism, where the formation of a glycoconjugate–BSA
complex takes place in the ground state. Despite the observed mechanism
for all studied compounds, the Tröger’s bases 1 presented lower values for the KSV and Kq in comparison with its glycoconjugates 4a–c, which can be related to a weaker
interaction with BSA.

It is worth mentioning that UV–vis
absorption spectroscopy
can also be a powerful tool to discuss the nature of the interaction
between BSA and the Tröger’s base (static or dynamic).
In this sense, since the dynamic mechanism involves only the excited
state, it is expected that no changes will take place in the absorption
spectrum (ground state). On the other hand, in the static mechanism,
changes in the absorption spectrum are expected due to the formation
of a new species (suppressor–BSA complex). Thus, equimolar
amounts of the suppressors were added to a solution of BSA and evaluated
by UV–vis absorption spectroscopy.50 In addition, in order to prove that the spectrum of BSA in the presence
of the suppressor is not only the sum of the absorbances of BSA and
the suppressor, the difference between the absorbance of the complex
and the suppressor was also obtained (Figure 6).

Figure 6 UV–vis absorption spectra of BSA in the
absence and presence
of the Tröger’s bases (a) 1, (b) 4a, (c) 4b, and (d) 4c.

It is observed that the BSA absorption bands in the presence
and
in the absence of the Tröger’s bases 4a–c differ from each other, which can be related
to a change in the aromatic residues of BSA due to the formation of
complexes BSA–Tröger’s bases, agreeing with the
assumption of the static mechanism. It is worth mentioning that this
experiment also indicates that the Tröger’s base 1, presented for comparison, shows close absorption spectra
(intensity and maxima location), which can be related to a lower interaction
with BSA, as already discussed in this study. Thus, considering the
static mechanism, the binding constant (KA) and the number of binding sites (n) between BSA
and suppressor can be calculated from eq 7:51 7  

Table 4 presents
the results from the double logarithmic plot relating the fluorescence
intensities from BSA and the quencher concentration. According to
these results, it was observed that glycoconjugates 4a–c present a strong interaction with BSA due
to the high values of binding constant KA higher than 105 L·mol–1. Further,
the binding constants (KA) for Tröger’s 4a and 4b bases increase with thetemperature,
and there are two binding sites with BSA. On the other hand, for glycoconjugate 4c, there is only one binding site with BSA, and there is
no tendency for KA with the temperature.
The observed differences between glycoconjugates such as the magnitude
of KA, number of binding sites, and linearity
allow us to conclude that the glycosyl portion plays a fundamental
role on the interaction with the protein. For the Tröger’s
base containing the methyl group, this analysis was not conclusive,
since the results of KA and the number
of binding sites present a great variation in a very random way.

In order
to investigate the interactions between the Tröger’s
base derivatives 4a–c and 1 with BSA, docking simulations were performed. It could be observed
from the predicted binding energy (ΔGbind) summarized in Table 5 that glycoconjugates 4a, 4b, and 4c present a more spontaneous interaction with BSA than the
Tröger’s base model 1. These results are
correlated with the experimental data, which indicates that the glycoconjugates
present the major reduction in the BSA fluorescence. In relation to
the binding pose, the molecular docking show that 4a and 4b interact in the IB subdomain of BSA closely to Trp134 (∼10
Å) (Figure 7a,b),
while compounds 4c and 1 binds in the II
A region, interacting with Trp213 (3.4–6.4 Å) (Figure 7c,d). In general,
the compounds demonstrated H-bonds, hydrophobic, and electrostatic
interactions with the BSA protein. It is worth mentioning that the
BSA domains I A (1–112), I B (113–195), II A (196–303),
II B (304–383), III A (384–500), and III B (501–583)
presented in Figure 7 were based on previous studies.52,53

a Kd refers
to the dissociation constant between BSA and ligands obtained from Kd = exp[(ΔG × 1000)/(R × T))], where R is 1.98719 cal and T is 298.15 K.

It could be observed that the H-bonds
presented by the glycoconjugates 4a–c are essential for the better binding
affinity to BSA. Likewise, the Tröger’s base 1 that does not show H-bonds presented low BSA fluorescence quenching.
In other words, the Tröger’s base functionalization
with glycosyl and triazole moieties increases the affinity with BSA.
In fact, the H-bonds have an important role in the complex stabilization,
as already reported in the literature.54,55 The interaction
of the Tröger’s base in I B52,56 and II A51,57,58 subdomains could induce conformational changes in BSA. As a result,
the tryptophan fluorescence quenching can be affected.

Considering
that the AutoDock Vina does not calculate the Ki values, in this study, it was performed the Ki prediction based on the ΔG from
docking using the relation Ki =
exp((ΔG × 1000)/(R × T)), where R is 1.98719 cal and T is 298.15 K, according to previous studies.59,60 We would like to highlight that, in this investigation, it was decided
to use the term Kd (dissociation constant)
rather than Ki (inhibition constant) due
to the protein nature of BSA despite the enzymatic one, where the
term inhibition is better used. As shown in Table 5, the predicted Kd values are in accordance with the KA data, where compound 4b presents the preferential binding
for BSA, while compound 1 shows the lowest one.

Conclusions
It was described, in this investigation, the modification of the
Tröger’s base scaffold with carbohydrates. Both moieties
have been linked together efficiently by a 1,2,3-triazole through
copper-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition of a Tröger’s
base-alkyne and carbohydrate-derived azides. The Tröger’s
bases presented absorption maxima located in the UV region with an
almost absent solvatochromic effect. The Tröger’s bases
presented a main emission located around 350 nm. The unexpected higher
fluorescence quantum yields if compared to the values from the Tröger’s
base framework indicated that the glycosyl moieties are not efficient
excited-state deactivation channels. The time-resolved fluorescence
spectroscopy showed a monoexponential time decay with lifetime values
between 1.4 and 2.0 ns with good χ2 values. BSA fluorescence
suppression was observed in glycoconjugates 4a–c mainly due to the carbohydrate moiety, which presented a
higher Stern–Volmer constant despite the simpler Tröger’s
base 1.

Experimental Section
General Information
Air-sensitive reactions were carried
out in oven-dried glassware equipped with tightly fitted rubber septa.
In these reactions, a positive pressure of dry argon was applied.
Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed using Silica Gel 60
F254. Column chromatography was performed using Silica Gel 60 Å
(70–230 mesh). Carbohydrate-derived azides were synthesized
according to the literature.61,62 NMR spectra were recorded
in CDCl3 solution on a Varian VNMRS 300 or 400 MHz or a
Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer. Assignment of chemical shifts is based
on standard NMR experiments and reported in parts per million (ppm)
related to tetramethylsilane (δ = 0.00 ppm in 1H
NMR) or from the solvent peak of CDCl3 (δ = 77.23
ppm in 13C NMR). The data are presented as follows: chemical
shift (δ), multiplicity, coupling constant (J) in Hz, and the integrated intensity. 13C NMR spectra
were recorded at 75 or 100 MHz in CDCl3 solution. The multiplicities
are given as s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), dd (double doublet),
m (multiplet), q (quartet), and br (broad singlet). High-resolution
mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization (HRMS-ESI) measurements
was performed on the positive mode. FTIR spectra were acquired with
a Bruker spectrometer (Alpha) using an attenuated total reflectance
(FTIR-ATR) device. Melting points were obtained on a Buchi M-565 and
are uncorrected. In the photophysical studies, spectroscopic-grade
solvents were used. All measurements were performed at 25 °C.
The UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2450
spectrophotometer. The steady-state fluorescence spectra were recorded
on a Shimadzu spectrofluorometer model RF-5301PC. Time-resolved fluorescence
spectroscopy was performed using an EasyLife V spectrophotometer from
Optical Building Blocks (OBB). The decay curves were analyzed using
the software EasyLife V (OBB). Curve fitting was performed by a nonlinear
least-squares method. The quality of the fit was evaluated by the
χ2 values, the respective residuals, and the autocorrelation
function. The quantum yield of the fluorescence (ΦFL) was calculated by applying the dilute optical method using spectroscopic-grade
cyclohexane. Naphthalene (ΦFL = 0.23) was used as
the quantum yield standard.63 The Tröger’s
base 2,8-bis(methyl)-6H,12H-(5,11)-methanodibenzo[b,f][1,5]diazocine presented in Figure 1 and used in this
study was prepared as described in the literature.40

BSA Interaction Study
Due to the
low solubility in
water, the Tröger’s bases were first solubilized in
dimethylformamide (DMF) (∼2 × 10–4 M)
to prepare a stock solution in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) (25
mL) to a final dye concentration of 14 μM. The BSA suppression
study was performed using a constant BSA concentration (11 μM
in phosphate buffer solution, pH 7.2). In this study, different amounts
of the dye solutions (5–50 μM in PBS) were added. The
fluorescence emission spectra were obtained at 25 °C and under
an excitation wavelength located at 280 nm. For the experiments at
different temperatures, the samples were kept in a water bath, with
a thermometer-controlled temperature of one decimal place.

Docking
The structure of bovine serum albumin (BSA)
was obtained from the Protein Data Bank.64,65 The addition of chain B, water, and other small molecules, as well
as hydrogen atoms was performed by the Chimera 1.8 software.66 The software Avogadro 1.1.1 was used to build
the chemical structure of the Tröger’s base derivatives67 following the semiempirical PM6 geometry optimization
(Program MOPAC2012).68,69 Here, as a model of interaction,
only the R isomers were tested. The Tröger’s
bases and BSA were generated in the pdbqt format
by AutoDockTools. In this methodology, the Tröger’s
bases were considered flexible (with PM6 charges), and BSA was considered
rigid (with Gasteiger charges).70 The blind
docking was performed by the AutoDock Vina 1.1.1 software71 with a gridbox of 96 × 64 × 88 and
the coordinates x = 9.46, y = 23.36,
and z = 98.15 (exhaustiveness of 150). For the binding
pose, the respective conformation with the lowest binding free energy
(ΔG) was selected. The results from docking
were analyzed using the Discovery Studio Visualizer 17.2.0 (DSV) software.72
