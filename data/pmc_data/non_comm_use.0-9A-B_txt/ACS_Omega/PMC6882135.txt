Histone deacetylase
11 (HDAC11) preferentially removes fatty acid
residues from lysine side chains in a peptide or protein environment.
Here, we report the development and validation of a continuous fluorescence-based
activity assay using an internally quenched TNFα-derived peptide
derivative as a substrate. The threonine residue in the +1 position
was replaced by the quencher amino acid 3′-nitro-l-tyrosine and the fatty acyl moiety substituted by 2-aminobenzoylated
11-aminoundecanoic acid. The resulting peptide substrate enables fluorescence-based
direct and continuous readout of HDAC11-mediated amide bond cleavage
fully compatible with high-throughput screening formats. The Z′-factor is higher than 0.85 for the 15 μM
substrate concentration, and the signal-to-noise ratio exceeds 150
for 384-well plates. In the absence of NAD+, this substrate
is specific for HDAC11. Reevaluation of inhibitory data using our
novel assay revealed limited potency and selectivity of known HDAC
inhibitors, including Elevenostat, a putative HDAC11-specific inhibitor.

Introduction
Reversible ac(et)ylation
of lysine side chains has emerged as one
of the major regulatory mechanisms in living organisms. It is involved
in the modulation of protein–protein interactions, protein
localization and degradation, and moreover in chromatin assembly,
DNA repair, and metabolic stress response. Acyl residues are introduced
either by the action of acetyltransferases using acyl-CoAs as cosubstrates
or by spontaneous reactions of acyl-CoA thioesters with the lysine
side chains. In the past 10 years, other types of acyl modifications,
propionylation,1 butyrylation,1 malonylation,2,3 succinylation,4 glutarylation,5 crotonylation,6 3-hydroxybutyrylation,7 4-oxo-nonaoylation,8,9 hydroxyisobutyrylation,10 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutarylation,11,12 3-methyl-glutarylation,11,12 3-methyl-glutaconylation,11,12 3-phosphoglycerylation,13 benzoylation,14 myristoylation,15 and stearoylation16 have been identified,
thereby dramatically expanding the portfolio of post-translation modifications
controlling a number of cellular processes.17,18

Removal of acyl residues from lysines is catalyzed by histone
deacetylases
(HDACs). This reaction is more tightly regulated by the substrate
and acyl specificities of individual HDACs and their spatiotemporal
distribution within the cell. HDACs are evolutionarily conserved among
organisms. Based on sequence homology and enzymatic mechanism, HDACs
can be divided into 4 classes. Members of classes I (HDAC 1, 2, 3,
and 8), II (HDAC4–7, 9 and 10), and IV (HDAC11) are Zn2+-dependent hydrolases, while class III proteins (called sirtuins;
SIRT 1–7) use NAD+ as the cosubstrate for the transfer
of the acyl moiety from the lysine side chain to the ADP-ribosyl fragment
of NAD+ generating nicotinamide as the third product of
the reaction.19 Recently, our group and
others identified a robust defatty acylase activity for HDAC11,20−22 which may represent the major enzymatic activity of HDAC11 in vivo.
HDAC11 is involved in the regulation of the immune system and the
modulation of cancer growth,19,23 and very recently,
it has been demonstrated that HDAC11 knock-out protects mice from
high-fat diet-induced obesity and metabolic syndrome,24 making HDAC11 an interesting target for the treatment of
cancer and obesity-related diseases.

There is only limited information
on the development and use of
HDAC11-specific inhibitors. In 2017, Huang et al. reported Elevenostat
(compound JB3-22), the putative HDAC11-specific inhibitor, to be effective
in pharmacologic modulation of functions of T-regulatory cells.25 Very recently, the development of FT895, a hydroxamate-based
small-molecule compound, has been described by Martin et al.,26 and 2-carboxamidothiophene-based zinc ion chelating
carbohydrazides were shown to be selective HDAC11 inhibitors active
in vivo.27 Additionally, several pan-HDAC
inhibitors used in clinical trials, including romidepsin and trichostatin
A (TSA), are reported to have nanomolar potency for HDAC11. At the
same time, however, inhibitory constants of these and other small
molecules toward HDAC11 listed in the ChemBL database are somewhat
inconsistent, and these inconsistencies may stem from different assay
conditions (pH values, the presence of additives like bovine serum
albumin (BSA) or detergents, and substrate concentrations) as well
as the use of suboptimal substrates like acetylated peptides, which
are very poorly accepted by HDAC11. Consequently, we believe that
reevaluation of some of these findings would be valuable for the scientific
community focused on biological experiments in the future.

The
detection of HDAC activity is often coupled to a separation
of a substrate and its reaction product. Different methods are used
for such separation steps, including capillary electrophoresis,28 microchip electrophoresis,29 microfluidic mobility assay,30,31 polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis,32 high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC),33−36 thin-layer chromatography,37 charcoal-binding,38 binding to boronic
acid resins,39 and extraction with organic
solvents.40 Owing to this additional separation
step, the resulting assay format is discontinuous and not suited for
high-throughput applications. Alternatively, mass spectrometry could
be used for the separation of the substrate and the reaction product.41,42 Matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass
spectrometry readout, in combination with peptide derivatives immobilized
on glass surfaces, was used for the systematic profiling of substrate
specificity of HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8.43,44 Additionally,
HDAC activity patterns could be determined in cell lysates using this
technique.45 Moreover, the same technology
uncovered the dependence of the HDAC8 substrate specificity on the
nature of the metal ion within the active site.46 Alternative approaches make use of reagents sensing either
the acetylated substrates, like acetyllysine recognizing antibodies,47−52 or the reaction products. The release of radioisotopically labeled
acetate was used to analyze HDAC activity.53−56 More recently, acetate could
be captured by coupling to an enzymatic reaction,57 and a chemical reaction was used to trap the HDAC8-mediated
release of thioacetate yielding a chromophore.58 Reagents for the detection of the generated primary amine
in the peptide product could either be chemicals, like biotin-containing
active esters or activated fluorescent dyes, reacting with the lysine
side chain59,60 or intramolecular reactions,
like transesterification with a coumarin dye,61 which is only possible if the lysine side chain is released by HDAC
activity.62−65 Additionally, aggregation-induced emission66,67 and modulation of binding to DNA68,69 were used
to probe HDAC activity.

An interesting alternative is the coupling
of the HDAC-mediated
reaction to a proteolytic reaction using proteases, specific for the
free lysine side chain in the reaction product.34,56,70,71 The fluorescence-based
readout for the proteolytic reaction is common to increase the sensitivity
of the assay. Commercially available HDAC substrates are fused to
7-amino-4-methylcoumarin, resulting in bright fluorescence subsequent
to cleavage of the lysinyl-coumaryl amide bond.72−78 However, as the proteolytic stability of different HDACs against
the developer proteases is limited, most protease-coupled HDAC assays
have to be performed in a discontinuous manner. The additional disadvantage
stems from the fact that the substituted coumaryl moiety represents
an artificial residue within the HDAC substrate preventing the investigation
of substrate specificities in +1, +2, etc. positions. Moreover, it
was demonstrated that profiling of HDAC activity with substrates containing
coumaryl fluorophores yielded results different from screening results
with more natural substrates, including artificially enhanced affinity
to the active site (HDAC6) or loss of sequence specificity (HDAC4).79 Additionally, substrates of this type are characterized
by suboptimal KM-values in the high micromolar
range.

Continuous assays without coupling to enzymatic or chemical
reactions
are described for sirtuins.80,81 In these cases, a fluorophore
or a quencher is an integral part of the acyl moiety linked to the
lysine side chain. Such an approach is not feasible for HDACs of classes
I and II because their narrow acyl binding pockets cannot accommodate
acyl groups decorated with bulky fluorophore moieties. In contrast,
HDAC11 is able to remove hydrophobic, long-chain acyl residues from
lysine side chains,20−22 and therefore, we wondered if continuous substrates
described for sirtuins are suitable for the determination of HDAC11
activity. Here, we report the development of a continuous and direct
activity assay for HDAC11 based on internal fluorescence quenching.
Using this novel HDAC11 activity assay in comparison to the data generated
using a commercially available trifluoroacetylated lysine derivative,
we were able to reevaluate the potency of known HDAC inhibitors including
Elevenostat, Pracinostat, Quisinostat, Dacinostat, Trapoxin A, and
Romidepsin. Additionally, we were able to demonstrate that this HDAC11
activity assay is fully compatible with high-throughput screening
formats.

Results
Continuous and Direct Activity Assay for
HDAC11
HDAC11
is able to remove decanoyl, dodecanoyl, and myristoyl residues from
lysine side chains in the sequence context of a substrate sequence
derived from peptide microarray experiments.22 We wondered if the active site of HDAC11 could adopt an aminoundecanoic
acid residue, which is acylated by anthranilic acid. In the past,
we were able to demonstrate that such modification of the acyl moiety
is well tolerated by most of the class III HDACs (sirtuins).81 Fluorescence of the anthraniloylamide is efficiently
quenched by a 3-nitrotyrosine residue in the +1 position of a TNFα-derived
peptide substrate 1, resulting in an increase of fluorescence subsequent
to HDAC11 treatment (Figure S2). We used
substrate 1 (see Figure 1) because it is derived from a known in vivo myristoylation site.82 First, we analyzed the substrate properties
using human HDAC11 in combination with an HPLC-based assay as described.20 Substrate 1 is well accepted by HDAC11 with
a specificity constant very similar to the values for trifluoroacetylated
substrates used in protease-coupled assay formats. To increase the
wavelength used for the excitation of fluorescence, we generated peptidic
substrate 2 (Figure 1) equipped with a sterically more demanding fluorophore. Using an
HPLC-based activity assay, we were able to demonstrate the cleavage
of the amide bond at the side chain of the lysine residue but with
very poor kinetics (Figure S3). After treatment
with 500 nM HDAC11 for 1 h, around 6% substrate conversion could be
detected. Obviously, the hydrophobic pocket of HDAC11 accepting the
acyl lysine is sensitive to sterically more demanding moieties, at
least at the distal positions.

Figure 1 General structure of the substrates. Peptide
substrates 1 and 2
were derived from the known myristoylation site TNFα-Lys20.15 The naturally occurring threonine residue in
+1 position is replaced by the quencher l-3-nitrotyrosine.
The lysine side chain corresponding to Lys20 of TNFα is acylated
with fluorescent N-anthraniloylated (peptide 1) or N-(4-N,N-dimethylamino-1,8-naphthalimido)acetyl (peptide
2) 11-aminoundecanoic acid. Lysine derivative 3 represents the commercially
available trifluoroacetylated HDAC substrate.

When fluorescence change was monitored over time, the resulting
progress curves at different concentrations of HDAC11 were linear
up to 25% conversion of the substrate. In the absence of HDAC11, a
slight fluorescence decrease of 7% of the total fluorescence intensity
is detectable after 30 min (Figure 1a). The slope of the fluorescence increases of reaction
solutions containing 1 and HDAC11 is dependent on the enzyme concentration,
resulting in a linear correlation between the HDAC11 amount and the
reaction rate (Figure 1b). This dependence on enzyme concentration demonstrates that the
measured signal increase is caused by the enzyme-mediated cleavage
of the amide bond and not by fluorescence artifacts. Therefore, peptide
derivative 1 could be used for the recording of HDAC11 activity in
a continuous format. For the generation of appropriate calibration
curves, N-(2-aminobenzoyl)-11-aminoundecanoic acid,
the reaction product, was used. We found a pronounced dependence of
HDAC11 activity on the concentration of bovine serum albumin (BSA)
in the assay buffer (Figure 2c). Therefore, all measurements were performed in the presence
of 2 mg/mL of BSA. To ensure that this concentration of BSA does not
affect the inhibitor’s potency, we have tested the quisinostat
as a representative of moderately active inhibitors in different concentrations
of BSA in the buffer. No decisive effect of BSA on the activity of
the inhibitor was observed at concentrations tested (Supporting Information Figure S5). To demonstrate that the activity
assay is useful for high-throughput screenings, we performed measurements
in 96-, 384-, and 1536-well microtiter plates (Figure 2d) yielding excellent Z′-factors
of 0.85 for 1 at 15 μM concentration. The KM values determined using the different microtiter plate
formats are very similar, and the resulting specificity constants
are in the range of 11 000 to 13 000 M–1 s–1 (Figure 2).

as a function of time. The excitation/emission wavelengths were set
at 330 ± 75/430 ± 8 nm, respectively. The reaction was performed
with the 15 μM substrate and 30 nM HDAC11 (blue dots) as well
without enzyme (gray dots). (B) Fluorescence change as a function

(C) Velocity of the product formation as a function of BSA concentration
in the buffer. The substrate concentration (peptide 1) was 20 μM
and HDAC11 concentration was 30 nM. The experiment was performed once
with n = 6, and the error bars show the standard
deviation (SD). (D) Steady-state kinetics of HDAC11 with compound 1. Reactions were performed using 30 nM HDAC11 and varying
concentrations of 1 (0.1–70 μM). The results are from
two independent experiments, and each experiment was done with n = 3 (96 well), n = 4 (384 well), and n = 6 (1536 well) replicates, and the error bars show the
standard deviation. The velocity v means product formation per time
unit and per active site. The resulting kinetic constants of the fit
are summarized in the table below.

Figure 4 Determination
of IC50 values for CUDC-907 using substrates
1 and 3. Ki-values were calculated with
the Cheng–Prusoff relationship.102 The KM-value used for the calculation
for compound 1 was 12 μM and for compound 3 200 μM.

Because HDAC8 is the
only other Zn2+-dependent HDAC,
which is able to accept longer acyl moieties, we tested peptides 1
and 2 as HDAC8 substrates using an HPLC-based activity assay. We found
less than 1% cleavage using 500 nM HDAC8 for 4 h, with a 20 μM
peptide substrate. Thus, in the absence of NAD+, which
prevents any action of sirtuins against 1, peptidic substrate 1 could
be considered as an HDAC11-specific substrate.

Reevaluation of known HDAC
Inhibitors Using Peptidic Substrate
1 and Trifluoroacetyllysine Derivative 3
Most of the typical
HDAC inhibitors are not active against HDAC11. Nevertheless, several
inhibitors were described for HDAC11 with IC50 values in
the low nanomolar range. Trapoxin A is an inhibitor of HDAC11 activity
with an IC50 value of 170 nM and a Ki value of 24 nM if a myristoylated peptidic substrate was
used for activity measurements. We determined the IC50-value
for Trapoxin A-mediated HDAC11 inhibition using 1 to validate the
continuous and fluorescence-based activity assay. We found an IC50 value of 10 nM (Table 1), which is in good agreement with the data from the
literature. TSA is an inhibitor for HDAC11 with described affinities
between 14 nM83 and 32 μM.21 If measured with an acetylated fluorogenic pentapeptide
derived from p53, an IC50 value of 17 nM was reported.84 In contrast, no efficient inhibition by TSA
could be detected using a myristoylated peptidic derivative with an
estimated IC50 value of 32 μM.21 We used 1 to reanalyze the effect of TSA on HDAC11 activity
and obtained less than 50% inhibition at 20 μM inhibitor resulting
in an IC50 of 22 μM (Table 1). This demonstrates that substrate 1 yielded
results closer to results found using myristoylated substrates. For
comparison, we profiled TSA-mediated inhibition of HDAC11 with the
trifluoroacetylated lysine derivative 3 and again found no effective
inhibition (an IC50 value of 10 μM). Similarly, we
analyzed romidepsin, a cyclic peptidic inhibitor used in the clinic.
An IC50 value of 0.3 nM85 could
not be confirmed using either substrate 1 or 3 (Table 1). In our hands, romidepsin is active against
HDAC11 with the IC50 value in the low μM range. This
finding is supported by the reported IC50 value of higher
than 10 μM if a trifluoroacetylated substrate peptide was used.86 To our surprise, several inhibitors that are
described to be highly efficient against HDAC11, like Dacinostat,
Elevenostat, Pracinostat, Mocetinostat, and Quisinostat, are not so
effective if analyzed using substrates 1 and 3 (Table 1). In all cases, the reported values were
generated using acetylated substrates. On the other hand, we were
able to confirm the efficient inhibition of HDAC11 by fimepinostat
using substrate 1, demonstrating that 1 is suitable for inhibitor
screenings resulting in less false positives compared to screenings
with acetylated substrates.

Discussion
HDAC11 is one of the least studied HDAC isoforms.
To evaluate its
biological function, highly efficient tools are needed, like compound
selectively inhibiting HDAC11 with high affinity. Screening of large
compound libraries is limited by the complex assays known for HDAC
activity measurements. Most of the fluorogenic assays are discontinuous
because of the limited stability of the HDACs against the developer
protease used. Alternative assays, like HPLC-based or MS-based formats,
are very time consuming, and therefore not suited for HTS applications.
Moreover, HDAC11 is unique in the sense of substrate specificity.
It has very poor activity against acetylated substrates but robust
activity on trifluoroacetylated substrates and substrates with decanoylated
or myristoylated lysine side chains. Based on this knowledge, we developed
peptidic substrate 1, which is from the structural point of view closer
to the myristoylated in vivo substrates. We then used this substrate
to reevaluate some of the HDAC inhibitors, especially compounds described
to be efficient against HDAC11 (Table 1, Figure 3). There are two major findings. First, effective inhibitors identified
using either trifluoroacetylated substrates (Fimepinostat)87 or myristoylated substrates (Trapoxin A21) could be confirmed using substrate 1. Second,
effective compounds identified using acetylated substrates are not
so effective if analyzed using either 1 or 3 (Table 1). The very poor activity of HDAC11 against
acetylated substrates generates a problem if the enzyme preparation
is contaminated with traces of HDACs that are highly active against
acetylated substrates. Such contaminations are probably because most
of the commercially available HDAC11 preparations have suboptimal
purity. Depending on the respective kinetic constants, contaminating
HDAC amounts less than 0.1 percent (which is hardly visible in PAGE
gels) could generate a robust signal leading to false-positive screening
hits. This situation is better if trifluoroacetylated substrates are
used because HDAC11 is more active in such cases. Nevertheless, other
HDACs like HDAC4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 are known to recognize trifluoroacetyllysine
substrates with substantially higher efficacy. Substrate 1 is optimal
for HDAC11 measurements because this is the only isoform that is able
to handle this acyl moiety. In principle, sirtuins 1–6 can
deacylate substrate 1, but for that reaction, the presence of the
NAD+ cosubstrate is necessary.81

Careful inspection of the presented IC50 values
in Table 1 uncovers
higher IC50 values for measurements performed with substrate
1 compared
to lysine derivative 3 resulting in up to 5-fold differences. These
differences are smaller if the respective Ki-values are calculated because of the much better KM value of substrate 1 (Figure 4, Table S3). Additionally,
differences in inhibition constants depending on the chemical nature
of the used substrate are known in the field of sirtuin research88 and for HDAC8. Sippl et al. were able to demonstrate
that IC50 values can differ up to 10-fold, depending on
the used substrate.89

In summary,
we developed an efficient and HDAC11-selective substrate
enabling high-throughput screening of inhibitor libraries yielding
reduced false-positive hits.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals
All
chemicals were purchased from Sigma (Saint
Louis) if not denoted otherwise. Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was obtained
from Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany). Peptidic substrate 1 is commercially
available from JPT Peptide Technologies (Berlin, Germany) and lysine
derivative 3 was purchased from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland; #4060676).

The synthesis of all peptidic substrates is described.20,81 HDAC inhibitors were purchased from Selleckchem and Cayman Chemical.

HDAC11 Expression and Purification
Full-length human
HDAC11 was expressed and purified as described previously.20 Briefly, HDAC11 was expressed using HEK-293/T17
cells following transient transfection mediated by linear polyethylene
imine (PEI; Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA). Three days after transfection,
cells were harvested by centrifugation at 500g for
10 min and suspended in a lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 10
mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, pH 8) supplemented with
benzonase (2 U/mL; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and a cocktail of protease
inhibitors (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Cell lysis was enhanced by
the addition of Igepal-630 (final concentration 0.2%), followed by
incubation for 30 min at 4 °C. The cell lysate was cleared by
centrifugation at 40 000g for 30 min at 4
°C, and the supernatant was loaded on a Strep-Tactin column (IBA,
Gottingen, Germany) previously equilibrated in the lysis buffer. The
column was first washed with the lysis buffer supplemented with 2
mM ATP and 10 mM MgSO4, followed by the second wash with
the elution buffer (50 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES), 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5). Fusion
proteins were eluted with the elution buffer supplemented with 3 mM
desthiobiotin. Eluted proteins were concentrated to 2 mg/mL and flash-frozen
in liquid nitrogen.

Continuous Fluorescence Assay
The
assay was carried
out as described previously with a slight modification.81 The fluorescence measurements were performed
using a fluorescence spectrophotometer CLARIOstar (BMG Labtech GmbH,
Ortenberg, Germany) at λex = 310 nm and λem = 405 nm. The reaction mixture consisted of HDAC11, and
the substrate in a reaction buffer comprising 50 mM HEPES, 140 mM
NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 2 mg/mL BSA, and 1 mM TCEP, at pH 7.4 was adjusted
with NaOH (total volume 50 μL). The reactions were incubated
in black 384-well plates for 60 min at 37 °C, and the increase
of relative fluorescence reflecting the product formation was monitored.
This signal was converted into product concentration via calibration
curves of free N-(2-aminobenzoyl)-11-aminoundecanoic
acid, the product of the reaction. For the determination of kinetic
constants, 20 nM HDAC11 and the substrate in the concentration range
of 0.04–200 μM were used. The slope of the linear regression
of product formation against time yielded the reaction velocity rates
in μM/s. Kinetic constants (KM and kcat) were obtained by nonlinear regression analysis
according to Michaelis–Menten.

HPLC-Based Assay
The determination of kinetic constants
and IC50 values of inhibitors was carried out in parallel
to the continuous fluorescence assay by discontinuous assays analyzed
by means of reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography
(RP-HPLC). The reaction buffer, concentration of enzyme, substrates,
and inhibitors were carried out as described above. The reaction was
quenched by the addition of 0.5% acetic acid after 30 min of incubation
and centrifuged at 2000g at 37 °C for 15 min
to remove precipitated BSA and HDAC11. The reactions were analyzed
by RP-HPLC (Shimadzu, HPLC Prominence system) with a Kinetex 2.6 μm
XB-C18 100 Å column (100 × 3 mm; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA).
The mobile phase A was 5% acetonitrile with 0.1% (v/v) TFA and the
mobile phase B was 95% acetonitrile with 0.1% (v/v) TFA. The separation
of the reaction product from the acylated substrate was performed
in a 12-min linear gradient from 10 to 60% of eluent B at a flow rate
of 0.6 mL/min. The product and substrate peaks were quantified using
the absorbance at 365 nm (absorption of the 3-nitrotyrosyl moiety)
to verify the results of the fluorescence assay.

Discontinuous
Fluorescence-Based Assay using Boc-Lys(TFA)-7-amino-methylcoumarylamide
Derivative
The assay was carried out using the commercially
available substrate 3 as described previously with a slight modification.90 Briefly, 60 nM HDAC11 was incubated with an
inhibitor in the concentration range of 0.006–100 000
nM. The reaction was started with the 10 μM substrate and quenched
after 30 min at 37 °C by the addition of 20 μL of trypsin
solution (2 mg/mL trypsin, 20 mM Tris–HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM
EDTA; pH 7.4). Following the 60 min incubation at 37 °C, a fluorescence
signal of released aminomethylcoumarin was quantified using a CLARIOstar
fluorimeter (BMG Labtech GmbH, Ortenberg, Germany) with excitation/emission
wavelengths set at 365/440 nm, respectively.

of IC50 values, 20 nM HDAC11 was preincubated 10 min with
an inhibitor in the concentration range of 0.006–100 000
nM, and the reaction was started by the addition of 15 μM of
substrate 1. The data were fitted using GraphPad Prism software, and
IC50 values were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis.
The inhibitor-free and enzyme-free controls were defined as 100 and
0% HDAC11 activity, respectively. All measurements were performed
in duplicates.

Determination of Kinetic Constants
The assay was carried
out as described previously with a slight modification.91 The fluorescence measurements were performed
with an EnVision 2104 Multilabel reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham). An
excitation filter with λ = 330 ± 75 nm and an emission
filter with λ = 430 ± 8 nm (percent of excitation light
= 2%, detector gain = 50, flashes per A/D conversion = 1, and number
of flashes = 30). The reaction mixture containing peptide 1 in various
concentrations and assay buffer (20 mM phosphoric acid pH 7.4 adjusted
with NaOH and 2 mg/mL BSA) was incubated at 25 °C in a 96-well
plate for at least 5 min. The reaction was started with the addition
of HDAC11 to a final concentration of 30 nM and a total volume of
100 μL per well. For the measurements in the 384-well plate
and the 1536-well plate, the reaction mixture (composition like above)
was incubated for at least 5 min in a clear 96-well plate. The reaction
was started with the addition of HDAC11, and the reaction mixture
with the enzyme was transferred to the -appropriate well plate (384-well
plate with 20 μL per well and 1536-well plate with 9 μL
per well). The increase of relative fluorescence intensity reflecting
product formation was monitored and the signal was converted via calibration
lines of free N-(2-aminobenzoyl)-11-aminoundecanoic
acid, the fluorescent product of the reaction. For the determination
of kinetic constants, 30 nM HDAC11 and the substrate in the concentration
range of 0.04–70 μM were used. The initial slope of the
linear regression of product formation against time yielded the reaction
velocity rates in μM/s. Kinetic constants (KM and kcat) were obtained
by nonlinear regression according to Michaelis–Menten.

Z′ Factor Determination
The Z′-factor is a dimensionless statistical parameter
for high-throughput screening assays.92 The Z′-factor was calculated from the mean
of the initial slope from the change of the fluorescence intensity
over time with 15 μM peptide 1 and 30 nM HDAC11 (mean (100%)).
The negative control was determined in the same way without enzyme
(mean (0%)). The standard deviation (SD) was calculated from 3 technical
replicates (96-well plate), 6 technical replicates (384-well plate),
and 8 replicates (1536-well plate). The fluorescence intensity was
measured with an EnVision Multilabel reader as described above. The Z′-factor was determined with the following equation.
