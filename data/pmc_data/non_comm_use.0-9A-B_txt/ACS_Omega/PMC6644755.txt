The transparent conductive electrodes
(TCEs) composed of silver
nanowires (Ag NWs) have shown promising applications recently. In
this study, we propose a solution-assembled process to obtain the
pattern controllable and uniform-ordered Ag NW grid TCEs by combining
with the lithographic technique. The transmittance of Ag NW grid TCEs
is controlled by the pattern of grids, but its sheet resistance can
be tuned by the diameter of Ag NWs in the grids. As the pattern of
grids is fixed, conductive property will improve with the decline
of the diameter of Ag NWs. This is a new and efficient strategy to
resolve the trade-off between optical transmittance and conductive
properties of the random metal nanowire networks for optoelectronic
devices.

1 Introduction
In recent years, transparent
conductive electrodes (TCEs) have
attracted much attention in the fabrication of optoelectronic devices,
such as touch-screen displays, organic light-emitting diodes, solar
cells, and photodetectors1,2 Traditionally, indium
tin oxide (ITO) electrodes are leading the market of TCEs in optoelectronic
devices.3,4 However, the rarity of indium and the high-cost
manufacturing technology have triggered intensive research studies
that can simultaneously improve electrical conductivity and optical
transmittance.2,5 So far, to replace ITO, researchers
have investigated metal nanowire networks, graphene, carbon nanotubes,
percolated metal films, and conductive polymers.6−11 Of these, metal nanowire-based networks with outstanding physical
properties appear to be one of the most promising alternatives to
ITO, including Ag, Cu, and Au.5 Among them,
Au NWs are the most expensive and Cu NWs have a great potential to
oxidize, which reduces the stability and conductivity of the film.12−14 Thus, we chose Ag as the raw material for TCEs. At the same time,
Ag NWs have a wide range of applications, including flexible transparent
conductors, touch panel, electronics, and energy devices.15−20 However, random metal geometries represent a trade-off between optical
transmittance and conductive properties. Thinner and sparser layers
provide better optical transmission but reduce the electrical conduction
and vice versa.

The metal grid has recently been proven to be
a promising structure
for high-performance TCEs because of its junction-free characteristic.21 Unlike random networks, controlled network geometries
allow engineered spectral transmission by optimizing trench width.
Besides, it is free from moire-pattern problem because of the random
nature of the nanowire in grooves.22 Metal
grids can be fabricated by various methods, such as lithographic techniques,23−27 cracked templates,28,29 transfer printing,21 selective laser sintering, and ablation.30−33 However, many of the nonlithographic approaches or most printing
processes typically take a long time to complete because of the serial
process. Lithographic methods that fabricated metal-grid-based flexible
and stretchable TCEs are more advantageous because of the facile optimization
to realize the tunability of optoelectronic performance.

The
cost-effective alternatives based on deposition and welding
of metal nanowires prepared in solution have proven effective to achieve
transparent electrodes with remarkable performances.5,34−36 The main advantage of a metal nanowire network is
the facilitation of a fast path for the nanowire electron conduction
through the network.37 In this work, we
demonstrate an approach that combines a lithographic technique and
a solution deposition process to fabricate highly controlled two-dimensional
networks by using Ag NWs. After embedding Ag NWs in trenches and decomposition
of the organic moiety, we obtain pure nanowire grid TCEs. Importantly,
the sheet resistance of nanowire grid TCEs can be reduced by decreasing
the diameter of Ag NWs. We propose an effective strategy to overcome
the trade-off between optical transmittance and conductive properties
of the random metal nanowire networks.

2 Results
and Discussion
Figure 1a shows
the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the Ag nanoparticles
and Figure 1b,c shows
the SEM images of Ag NWs with an average diameter of ∼40 and
∼180 nm, respectively. The Ag nanoparticles and Ag NWs were
synthesized by polyol process. During the synthetic process, with
the reduction of AgNO3 and PtCl2 by EG in the
presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), Ag nanoparticles are first
formed via homogeneous nucleation process and heterogeneous nucleation
on the platinum seeds. With the addition of Ag+ continuously,
these Ag nanoparticles are monodispersed because PVP macromolecules
can chemically absorb onto their surfaces.38 In addition, some Ag nanoparticles start to dissolve into the solution
or grow onto large nanoparticles via a process known as Ostwald ripening.39 Because of the selective adsorption of PVP molecules,
the large Ag nanoparticles are able to grow into rod-shaped structures.
Under these conditions, the (100) faces of these rodlike silver structures
passivated by PVP molecules and the (111) planes are active for anisotropic
growth at [110] direction.

with the diameter
of ∼40 nm, and (c) Ag NWs with the diameter of ∼180
nm.

Figure 2a shows
the SEM image of Ag nanoparticles coated in the grid template, and
the inset image shows partial enlargement. This image demonstrates
that the template after filling Ag nanoparticles is uniform. However,
the grids are not filled completely. Figure 3b shows the obtained Ag nanoparticle grid
TCEs after a photoresist lift-off. The transmittance of Ag nanoparticle
TCE is 84%; however, the sheet resistance is 0 because of the intermittent
lines of grids. Figure 3c shows the SEM image of the grid template with a wire width of 5
μm and a wire spacing of 25 μm, respectively.

respectively. (c) Grid template.

Figure 3 (a), (c), (e), and (g) SEM images of Ag NWs coated in the grid
template, S1, and after photoresist lift-off, the obtained Ag NW grid
TCEs of (b), (d), (f), and (h) corresponding to (a), (c), (e), and
(g). The inset shows the Ag NWs in the grid.

A series of Ag NW grid TCEs were fabricated, and their theoretical
transmittance can be calculated according to wire width and spacing,
as shown in Table 1. Figure 3 shows that
uniformity of the networks over a large area is exhibited in these
images. The Ag NWs are spread evenly in the surface of the substrates.
After removing the photoresist portion, uniform and clear Ag NW grids
are obtained. The interspaces filled with nanowires allow for successful
photoresist lift-off because the acetone solution primarily corrodes
and removes the photoresist with surface, coated by Ag NWs. The inset
in Figure 4f shows
tight junction of Ag NWs in the grid.

The electrical and optical properties and line scans
of the solution-assembled
Ag NW grids were characterized in Figure 4. The transmittances of all of the samples
are higher than that of the theoretical value, which attributed to
the light through the Ag NWs in the grids. By comparing S1 and S2
in Figure 5a, when
the diameters of the Ag NWs that were filled in S1 and S2 are both
180 nm; the result shows that the transparent electrode with smaller
wire width has a lower transmittance which can be attributed to stronger
scattering and absorption of light of compact grids.40 Besides, the conductivity of S1 is better than S2 in Figure 5b. The compact grids
fabricated with smaller diameter Ag NWs have better electrical property.
When we compare S3 and S4, the result is the same as comparing S1
and S2. When the wire width is same but the diameters of Ag NWs are,
respectively, around 180 and 40 nm, S1 with relatively thicker Ag
NWs has a better transmittance than that of S3, as shown in Figure 4a. The thinner Ag
NWs are stacked closely with each other, leading to a stronger absorption
and reflection of incident light, further causing a relatively poor
transmission. Besides, the conductivity of S1 is worse than S3 in Figure 5b. These results
agree with the fact that the electrode composed of smaller diameter
nanowires was reported to have a better conductivity.41

Figure 5 Fabrication process of Ag NW grid TCEs.

Thus, by comparing S1 with S2, the Rs and T increased by 74.7 and 6.0%, respectively.
As for S3 and S4, Rs and T are increased, respectively, by 94 and 7.4%. This result shows that
the variation of wire width has a greater influence on the Rs relative to T. At the same
time, the Rs and T increased,
respectively, by 66.0 and 3.3%, by comparing S3 with S1. As for S4
and S2, Rs and T are
increased, respectively, by 49.5 and 2.0%. This result shows that
the variation of the diameter of Ag NWs has a greater influence on
the Rs relative to T.
Moreover, Rs is greatly affected by wire
width relative to the diameter of Ag NWs through comprehensive comparison.
The results show that the transmittance is mainly determined by the
pattern of grid, but the sheet resistance can be tuned by the diameter
of Ag NWs in the grids. These findings provide an effective strategy
to solve the trade-off between optical transmittance and conductive
properties of the random metal nanowire networks.

To evaluate
the optoelectrical performance of the solution-assembled
Ag NW grid TCEs for optoelectronic devices, the figure of merit was
theoretically investigated. In general, the figure of merit is defined
as the ratio of the electrical conductance (σdc)
and the optical conductance (σOp), as shown in eq 1 1  where T(λ) is the transmission
located at 550 nm and Rs is the sheet
resistance.7 The other function for the
figure of merit is ΦTE, defined by Haacke,42 2  where T is the transmittance
with a pitch at 550 nm. For the high-performance electrode, it is
desirable to have a high value of σdc/σOp and ΦTE.36,43,44 The calculated ratio of σdc/σOp and ΦTE values are shown in Table 2. As for σdc/σOp, the figure of merit is improved with the increase
of the grid density and the decline of the diameter of Ag NWs. However,
ΦTE is obviously dependent on the diameter of Ag
NWs. These results support the strategy to solve the trade-off between
optical transmittance and conductive properties. When the Ag NW grid
with high transmittance and high grid density is patterned and prepared,
we can fabricate the high-performance TCEs with small diameter Ag
NWs by the solution process.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
we combine the substrate lithography and solution process
to construct Ag-nanostructured grid TCEs at room temperature, without
the need for energy-intensive vacuum metal evaporation processes.
This approach also has several other advantages, such as the reusability
of Ag nanostructured solution and the compatibility with large area
deposition techniques. Besides, this also shows that the ordered arrays
with solution deposition methods can match the vacuum-based techniques.

The photoelectric performance of the substrate which filled Ag
nanoparticles is poor; thus, the sample has not yet met the requirements
of the transparent electrode. Furthermore, the transmittance of solution-assembled
Ag NW grid TCEs is mainly determined by the structure of the grid,
but the sheet resistance can be tuned by the diameter of Ag NWs. Therefore,
we present a strategy to handle the trade-off between optical transmittance
and conductive properties of the random metal nanowire networks, which
is different from the common Ag NW meshes. We can design and prepare
the Ag NW grid TCEs with high transmittance and high grid density,
by solution assembling the small diameter Ag NWs in the grids. Therefore,
this simple strategy can be extended to other types of template-assisted
metal nanowire grid TCEs and can provide a general pathway for further
optimization of transparent conductor properties at low cost.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Acetone
(99.8%), isopropyl
alcohol (99.8%), ethylene glycol (EG, 99.8%), platinum chloride (PtCl2, 99.99%), and AgNO3 (99%) were of analytical grade
and purchased from Chengdu Kelong Chemical Corporation. PVP (MW ≈ 55 000, 360 000 and
1 300 000) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All chemicals
were used in this work without any further purification. Silver nanowire
(average diameter ≈ 40 nm) was purchased from C3NANO INC. All
chemicals were used in this work without any further purification.

4.2 Preparation of Ag NWs
All glassware
were successively cleaned with deionized water, basic solution, acidic
solution, acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and deionized water, respectively.
In a typical experiment which synthesizes Ag NWs with an average diameter
around 180 nm, 2 mL of 0.1 M AgNO3 EG solution and 2 mL
of 0.09 M PVP (MW ≈ 1 300 000)
EG solution were added into a disposable glass, mixed, and stirred
evenly. Then, 20 μL of 0.038 M PtCl2 EG solution
was injected using a syringe into the mixed solution. Then, the mixed
solutions were sealed and incubated at 160 °C for 6 h. Finally,
the precipitate was washed with deionized water for five times to
remove PVP residue. The products were dispersed into deionized water
for further characterization. When mixing PVP (MW ≈ 360 000) with PVP (MW ≈ 55 000) for a weight ratio of 1:1, we got
Ag NWs with an average diameter of 40 nm under the same remaining
conditions.

4.3 Solution-Assembly of Ag
NW Grid TCEs
The fabrication process is illustrated in Figure 5. First, the lithography
technology was adopted
to make square arrays on a photoresist film which was spin-coated
on a glass substrate (wire width 5–10 μm, wire spacing
25–50 μm). Then, the grid glass substrate was cleaned
with deionized water and dried in air at room temperature. Second,
the grid glass substrate was placed at the bottom of a beaker filled
with Ag NW solution (38 mg mL–1)and then the beaker
was shaken for 1 h. After the process of deposition, the substrate
was fully dried in air at room temperature. Third, the substrate was
placed at the bottom of a beaker filled with acetone solution and
then sonicated at 35 Hz for 2 min to remove the photoresist. Finally,
we obtained a substrate with Ag NW grid pattern and then put it in
an oven at 120 °C for 5 min.

4.4 Characterizations
The micrographs
were observed by SEM (Quanta 250, FEI, USA) with an acceleration voltage
of 20 kV. The transmission spectra were acquired by the UV–vis–near-infrared
spectrophotometer (UV-2010, G9825A, Agilent Technology, USA) with
a blank substrate as the reference. The sheet resistance was obtained
via a four-point probe (RTS-5, uncommon, China). The height and width
were determined with a profilometer (KLA-Tencor, D-100, California,
USA).
