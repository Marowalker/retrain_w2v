Immobilization of Pt-based nanoparticles
on carbon support is of
great significance in catalysis for their superior activity and enhanced
durability. Herein, we report for the first time a feasible NaCl template-engaged
approach to firmly immobilize PtNi nanoparticles into two-dimensional
(2D) graphitic carbon nanosheets (denoted as PtNi@GCNs hereafter).
The elaborate employment of the NaCl template regulates the formation
of 2D graphitic carbon nanosheets, which tightly immobilize the in
situ-generated PtNi nanoparticles. The smart integration of catalytically
active PtNi nanoparticles with carbon nanosheets endows the as-prepared
PtNi@GCNs with superior catalytic activity and outstanding stability
toward the hydrogenation of 4-nitrophenol, making them a promising
catalyst for environmental remediation. We believe that the present
work can inspire the future design of carbon nanosheet-based nanohybrids
with unique functionalities for diverse applications.

1 Introduction
Owing to their unique physiochemical properties, noble metal nanoparticles
(NPs), especially Pt-based NPs, have demonstrated appealing applications
in various realms, including optical devices,1−3 photocatalysis,4−7 fuel cell systems,8−18 and environmental remediation.19−26 However, in the catalytic field in particular, small-sized metal
NPs with relatively high surface energy are prone to aggregate together
to form larger particles, resulting in a substantial reduction of
the utilization efficiency of noble metal atoms and unsatisfactory
stability in practical applications.

One of the effective approaches
to suppress the undesirable aggregation
of noble metal NPs is to immobilize them on an appropriate substrate,
such as carbon-based nanomaterials.14,27−29 Hybridization with carbon support with high surface area and superior
mechanical robustness not only ensures the good dispersion of active
metal NPs, but also greatly improves the long-term stability of the
catalyst because of the affinity between metal NPs and the carbon
support. As a member of the carbon family, two-dimensional (2D) graphitic
carbon nanosheets have been documented as a promising candidate because
of their cost effectiveness, large surface area, and unique structural
anisotropy.30−33 Nevertheless, previous protocols regarding the immobilization of
metal NPs usually involve multistep fabrication procedures and the
NPs often easily detach from the support because of the weak binding
with the carbon support. In this context, it is highly imperative
to develop a feasible and reliable approach to strongly anchor noble
metal NPs with 2D graphitic carbon nanosheets, yet it still remains
a great challenge. On the other hand, alloying Pt with low-cost transition
metals (TMs), such as Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu, to form bimetallic Pt-TM
alloys can not only reduce the usage of precious Pt, but also facilitate
modifying the electronic structure of Pt, which usually results in
better catalytic properties as compared with monometallic counterparts
or their physical mixture. Taken together, intimate immobilization
of bimetallic Pt-TM NPs into 2D graphitic carbon nanosheets is reasonably
anticipated to afford superior catalytic activity and improved stability.

Motivated by the above considerations, we herein for the first
time demonstrate a facile NaCl-templated strategy to prepare 2D graphitic
carbon nanosheets embedded by PtNi NPs (denoted as PtNi@GCNs). The
elaborate employment of the NaCl template regulates the formation
of 2D graphitic carbon nanosheets, which firmly immobilize the in
situ-generated PtNi NPs. Thanks to the abundant firmly stabilized
PtNi NPs for catalytic sites and unique 2D sheetlike structure for
electron transport and mass diffusion, the prepared PtNi@GCNs exhibit
extraordinary catalytic performance toward the hydrogenation of p-nitrophenol (4-NP) with superior activity and stability,
as compared with the commercial Pt/C catalyst. These findings suggest
that the as-synthesized PtNi@GCNs may hold grand promise in environmental
remediation and electrochemical energy conversion.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Synthesis of the 2D PtNi@GCNs
For
the typical synthesis of PtNi@GCNs, 0.2 g of glucose, 0.05 g of Pt(NO3)2, 0.045 g of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, and 0.7 g of NaCl were dissolved in 3 mL of HNO3 (30%) solution, forming a homogeneous solution. The resultant solution
was then dried at 60 °C to evaporate the solvent of H2O. The obtained mixture was subsequently heated to 750 °C for
3 h under an Ar atmosphere in a tube furnace. Once cooled down, the
resulting puffy black powder was finally washed with deionized water
and ethanol several times to remove the NaCl template. After drying
at 50 °C, the 2D PtNi@GCN product could be obtained.

2.2 Physical characterization
The morphology
and size of the product were characterized by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM, JEOL JSM-7600F), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Hitachi
H-7650, 120 kV), and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM, JEOL JEM-2010F, 200
kV). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the product was recorded
on a Rigaku D/max-RC diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (45
kV and 100 mA). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed
on a Thermo VG Scientific ESCALAB 250 spectrometer with an Al Kα
radiator. The binding energy has been calibrated by means of the C
1s peak energy of 284.6 eV. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed
on a Netzsch STA 449C thermal analyzer under an air atmosphere. The
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)-specific surface area was
measured by a Micromeritics ASAP 2050 at 77 K.

2.3 Catalytic
reduction of 4-NP
For the
reduction of 4-NP, NaBH4 was used as a reducing agent and
noble metal-based nanomaterials were employed as a catalyst. Typically,
2 mL of 4-NP solution (5 × 10–5 M) and 0.5
mL of freshly prepared aqueous NaBH4 solution (0.1 M) were
mixed to form 4-nitrophenolate. Subsequently, 10 μL of the synthesized
PtNi@GCN catalyst suspension (1 mg mL–1) was introduced
into the above solution to initiate the hydrogenation reaction for
the formation of 4-aminophenol (4-AP). The entire reduction progress
was monitored by the UV–visible absorption spectra recorded
on a Shimadzu UV3600 spectrophotometer at room temperature. For comparison,
the commercial Pt/C (20 wt %) was also tested as a catalyst under
identical conditions.

3 Results and Discussion
For the typical preparation of PtNi@GCNs, earth-abundant NaCl crystallites
are employed as a removable and recyclable template to modulate the
overall morphology of the final product. This strategy has been used
to produce carbon nanosheet-supported Ni NPs and porous Pt nanosheets
for lithium storage and oxygen reduction reaction, respectively.34,35Figure 1 schematically
illustrates the overall synthetic procedure of PtNi@GCNs. Briefly,
a mixture containing appropriate amounts of glucose, NaCl, Pt(NO3)2, and Ni(NO3)2 was first
dissolved in a diluted HNO3 solution to form a homogeneous
solution, followed by drying at 60 °C. During the evaporation
of H2O molecules, Pt(NO3)2, Ni(NO3)2, and glucose were conformally deposited on the
surface of NaCl crystallites because of the low solubility of NaCl.
Thereby, the surface of NaCl with high thermal stability provides
a 2D platform for the growth of graphitic carbon sheets. Upon the
subsequent pyrolysis in an Ar atmosphere at an elevated temperature,
the coated glucose would be carbonized into graphitic carbon nanosheets,
which could simultaneously reduce metal sources into PtNi NPs distributed
within the carbon matrix. Finally, the encased NaCl template could
be easily removed by copious washing and freestanding 2D graphitic
carbon nanosheets embedded by PtNi NPs could be eventually achieved.
It is noteworthy that the NaCl template can be readily recycled through
a simple recrystallization process, significantly reducing the synthetic
cost.

Figure 1 Schematic illustration showing the synthesis of PtNi NP-embedded
2D graphitic carbon nanosheets (PtNi@GCNs) using NaCl as the template.

The morphology of the resulting
PtNi@GCN sample was first characterized
by SEM and TEM. The panoramic SEM image (Figure 2a) reveals the 2D sheetlike structure of
the obtained PtNi@GCN sample. The magnified SEM image (Figure 2b) suggests that the lateral
size of the PtNi@GCNs is in the range of 8–16 μm. From
the front view of the nanosheet (Figure 2c), one can clearly observe that numerous
of PtNi NPs with high uniformity are homogeneously encapsulated in
the carbon nanosheet. A cross-sectional observation (Figure 2d) discloses that the thickness
of the carbon nanosheet is approximately 30 nm.

Figure 2 Representative SEM images
of the as-synthesized 2D PtNi@GCNs with
different magnifications.

In good agreement with the above SEM results, representative
TEM
images (Figure 3a,b)
verify that plenty of well-separated PtNi NPs are discretely dispersed
within the carbon matrix, effectively prohibiting the aggregation
of the PtNi NPs. A particle size distribution histogram (Figure 3c) of the PtNi NPs
indicates that the average diameter of the embedded PtNi NPs is ca.
21 nm. Figure 3d,e
presents the HRTEM images of an individual PtNi NP. The well-resolved
lattice interplanar spacings are measured to be 0.216 nm, corresponding
to the (111) lattice planes of face-centered cubic (fcc)-structured
PtNi. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern suggests
the polycrystalline feature of the PtNi NPs and the diffraction rings
are assigned to the (111), (200), and (220) planes of fcc-phased PtNi,
as marked in Figure 3f. The high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) and
elemental mapping analyses (Figure 3g) imply the uniform distribution of Pt and Ni throughout
the entire carbon nanosheets. The cross-sectional compositional line
profile (Figure 3i)
recorded from an individual PtNi NP (Figure 3h) validates the formation of the PtNi alloy.

an individual PtNi NP, (f) SAED pattern of a PtNi NP, (g) HAADF-STEM
image and elemental mappings of the PtNi@GCNs, and (h,i) EDX line-scan
profile of a single PtNi NP.

The composition of the obtained PtNi@GCN sample was further
investigated
by the XRD pattern. As shown in Figure 4a, the broad peak positioned at ca. 26° is indexed
to the (002) plane of graphitic carbon and the other strong diffraction
peaks can be well assigned to the PtNi intermetallic alloy (JCPDS
no. 65-2797). The energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum shown in Figure 4b confirms the presence
of Pt and Ni in the PtNi@GCN product with an atomic ratio of Pt/Ni
of around 48/52. The weight percentage of PtNi NPs in the PtNi@GCN
nanohybrid was quantified by TGA, as displayed in Figure 4c. The obvious weight loss
occurring in the range of 350–450 °C is attributed to
the removal of carbon. On the basis of the TGA curve, the weight fraction
of PtNi moiety is determined to be 40%. Raman spectroscopy (Figure 4d) is used to evaluate
the graphitization degree of the carbon nanosheets. Two distinguished
peaks at 1363 and 1596 cm–1 are corresponding to
the D band and G band of carbon materials, respectively. The relative
intensity ratio of the D band to the G band (ID/IG) of the PtNi@GCN sample is
identified as 0.85, indicating the highly graphitic feature of the
carbon nanosheets.

XRD pattern, (b) EDX spectrum, (c) TGA curve, and (d) Raman spectrum.

Figure 5a presents
the N2 sorption isotherms of the formed PtNi@GCNs, which
can be classified as type-IV isotherms with a noticeable hysteresis
loop and suggest the presence of mesopores. Additionally, the steep
N2 uptake at a low relative pressure region implies the
presence of micropores, which originate from the gas generated during
the decomposition of metal sources at a high temperature. Noticeably,
the coexistence of micropores and mesopores is advantageous for the
exposure of active sites and mass diffusion for catalytic reaction.
The BET-specific surface area of the PtNi@GCNs is measured to be 208.5
m2 g–1. The surface composition of the
PtNi@GCNs was examined by XPS. The survey scan spectrum (Figure 5b) corroborates that
the PtNi@GCNs are composed by Pt, Ni, and C. The high-resolution Pt
4f spectrum (Figure 5c) indicates that Pt exists predominantly as metallic Pt. The high-resolution
Ni 2p spectrum can be well deconvoluted into metallic Ni and oxidized
species (Figure 5d).
The Ni-based oxidized species might be caused by the surface oxidation
of the PtNi@GCNs.

As is well known, nitroaromatics
are hazardous pollutants in industrial
and agricultural fields, whereas the hydrogenated products of nitroaromatics,
aromatic amines, are key intermediates for pharmaceutical and chemical
industries.36−40 The hydrogenation of nitroaromatics catalyzed by a noble metal-based
catalyst represents an efficient and eco-friendly strategy to produce
aromatic amines.41−48 Because of the unique 2D architecture and enriched firmly immobilized
PtNi NPs, the as-prepared PtNi@GCN sample is reasonably expected to
be a high-efficient catalyst with superior activity and high durability.
As a proof-of-concept application, the catalytic activity of the PtNi@GCN
sample was appraised by the hydrogenation of 4-NP with the assistance
of a reducing agent of NaBH4, as illustrated in Figure 6a. The catalytic
performance was benchmarked against the commercial Pt/C (20 wt %)
catalyst. The stepwise hydrogenation process can be monitored by UV–vis
spectroscopy. As shown in Figure 6b, upon the introduction of the PtNi@GCN catalyst,
the color of the 4-nitrophenolate solution (caused by the reaction
between 4-NP and NaBH4) changes from light yellow to colorless
in 8 min, indicating the completion of the hydrogenation reaction.
Time-dependent UV absorption spectra indicate that the characteristic
absorption peak of 4-nitrophenolate at 405 nm decreases rapidly accompanied
by a successive increase at the 302 nm peak assigned to 4-AP. By contrast,
it takes 28 min for the commercial Pt/C catalyst to complete the reaction
under an identical condition, as evidenced by the UV absorption spectra
in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information.

Figure 6 Evaluation of catalytic hydrogenation performance of the PtNi@GCNs:
(a) stepwise hydrogenation processes from 4-NP to 4-AP, (b) UV–vis
absorption spectra of 4-NP during the hydrogenation reaction catalyzed
by PtNi@GCNs, (c) relationships of ln(Ct/C0) vs reaction time
plot in the presence of different catalysts, (d) recycling tests of
hydrogenation of 4-NP over five cycles by using PtNi@GCNs as catalyst,
and (e) TEM image of PtNi@GCNs after the recycling tests.

The concentration of NaBH4 considerably
exceeds that
of 4-NP and thus can be considered as a constant during the entire
reaction course. Therefore, the hydrogenation reaction follows the
pseudo-first-order kinetics depending on the concentration of 4-NP,
and the ln(Ct/C0) is linear with the reaction time t, where Ct and C0 refer to the concentration of
4-NP at t and initial solution, respectively. Figure 6c clearly shows the
linear correlationship between ln(Ct/C0) and t, and
the rate constant (k) of the PtNi@GCN catalyst is
calculated to be 0.28 min–1, which is three times
higher than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.09 min–1). The recyclability of a catalyst is also a crucial parameter for
practical applications. As suggested by Figure 6d, the PtNi@GCN catalyst could still maintain
high activity after five cycles, without evident deactivation during
the long-term operation. The TEM image (Figure 6e) indicates that the PtNi NPs are still
uniformly dispersed in the carbon sheets, without aggregation or detachment
from the carbon support. All these results strongly suggest that the
as-prepared PtNi@GCN catalyst is a highly efficient catalyst for hydrogenation
of 4-NP with superior activity and high stability. The excellent catalytic
performance of the resulting PtNi@GCN catalyst might be attributed
to its unique architectural feature and favorable compositions. Specifically,
(1) plenty of highly dispersed PtNi NPs could provide a high density
of active sites for the hydrogenation reaction; (2) the 2D carbon
nanosheets with high conductivity facilitate the electron transfer
from donor (NaBH4) to acceptor (nitrophenolate), expediting
the hydrogenation reaction; (3) the firm immobilization of PtNi NPs
with 2D carbon nanosheets could effectively prevent the detachment
or aggregation of active sites during the reaction, thus remarkably
increasing their stability.

4 Conclusions
In summary,
we have presented a facile and scalable approach for
the fabrication of uniform PtNi NP-embedded 2D graphitic carbon nanosheets
by using inexpensive NaCl as a recyclable template. The firm immobilization
of PtNi NPs within 2D carbon nanosheets could effectively suppress
the detachment or aggregation of PtNi NPs during the catalytic reaction.
Thanks to the unique architectural feature and favorable compositions,
the prepared PtNi@GCN catalyst is demonstrated to be a catalyst with
outstanding activity and robust stability for the hydrogenation of
4-NP, suggesting that the PtNi@GCN catalyst may hold great promise
in environmental remediation and so forth. We believe that the present
versatile synthetic methodology can be extendable to the rational
design of carbon nanosheet-based nanohybrids for diverse applications
in the future.
