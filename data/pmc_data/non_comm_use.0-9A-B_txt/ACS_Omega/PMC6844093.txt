Considering the sharp increase in
energy demand, Si-based composites
have shown promise as high-performance anodes for lithium-ion batteries
during the last few years. However, a significant volume change of
Si during repetitive cycles may cause technical and security problems
that limit the particular application. Here, an optimized reduced
graphene oxide/silicon (RGO/Si) composite with excellent stability
has been fabricated via a facile templated self-assembly strategy.
The active silicon nanoparticles were uniformly supported by graphene
that can further form a three-dimensional network to buffer the volume
change of Si and produce a stable solid-electrolyte interphase film
due to the increased specific surface area and enhanced intermolecular
interaction, resulting in an increase of electrical conductivity and
structural stability. As the anode electrode material of lithium-ion
batteries, the optimized 10RGO/Si-600 composite showed a reversible
high capacity of 2317 mA h/g with an initial efficiency of 93.2% and
a quite high capacity retention of 85% after 100 cycles at 0.1 A/g
rate. Especially, it still displayed a specific capacity of 728 mA
h/g after 100 cycles at a reasonably high current density of 2 A/g.
This study has proposed the optimized method for developing advanced
graphene/Si nanocomposites for enhanced cycling stability lithium-ion
batteries.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
rapid development of lithium-ion batteries (LIB) is driven
by a growing energy storage demand of new energy vehicles and portable
electronic equipment.1−4 To meet the requirements of high-power density and long lifespan
for large-scale LIB application, the improvement of energy density
and long-term stability for electrode materials is distinctly important.
In recent years, silicon has attracted much attention as the most
promising substitute to the traditional graphite anode materials owing
to the high theoretical capacity of about 4200 mA h/g and low operating
potential.5,6 However, the large volume expansion and
pulverization of silicon during the charge and discharge processes
lead to fast capacity fade and damage to the electrode that limit
particular LIB applications.7

To
address the main drawback, scientists have put much effort focus
on mitigating capacity fading in Si-based anodes, such as adding novel
binders,8−11 mixing additives,12−14 coating high-conductivity materials,15−19 and designing special silicon nanostructures.19−22 Besides the above-modified methods,
the silicon/nanocarbon composite with diverse structures have been
considered as the most potent strategy to improve the performance
of silicon material.23,24

Recently, graphene has
been utilized to modify silicon-based anode
materials for improving the comprehensive electrochemical performance,
preventing the aggregation of Si particles exposed to the electrolyte,
providing skeleton-support for buffering the mechanical stress, and
enhancing the lithium-ion transportation capability.25,26 Chou et al.27 first prepared Si/graphene
composite via a simple manual mixing method in 2010. The results displayed
that the anode materials maintained a capacity of 1168 mA h/g and
an average Coulombic efficiency of 93% after 30 cycles at 0.1 A/g.
Chang et al.28 successfully prepared a
silicon/reduced oxide graphene (RGO) nanocomposite with a three-dimensional
multilayer structure, exhibiting an excellent reversible capacity
up to 2300 mA h/g at 0.05 C (120 mA/g) and 87% capacity retention
(up to 630 mA h/g) at 10 C after 152 cycles. Park et al.29 presented that Si nanoparticles could be entrapped
RGO nanosheets by simple self-assembly without any chemical/physical
linkers. The test results displayed the improved cyclability (1481
mA h/g after 50 cycles) and favorable high-rate capability. Son et
al.30 presented multilayer graphene directly
grown on the Si nanoparticles surface by the chemical vapor deposition
method. The results revealed a significant improvement of the performance.
Zhou et al.31 fabricated Si/graphene composite
film decorated by bovine serum albumin via electrostatic self-assembly,
vacuum filtration, and annealing but the electrochemical performance
of this electrode is not good enough. Zhang et al.32 proposed 3D porous Si/RGO anode materials with tunable
pore size via controllable evaporation. The results revealed that
Si/RGO anode after evaporation drying for 3.5 h exhibits a high reversible
specific capacity of 1563 mA h/g at 50 mA/g, 90% capacity retention
after 100 cycles, and superior rate capability (955 mA h/g at 2 A/g).
However, although a large amount of research is focused on the silicon/graphene
anode materials, few works focus on exploring an efficient and feasible
method for preparing large-scale and stable-structured silicon/graphene
anode materials, simultaneously keeping the high reversible capacity
and long-term stability at a high rate current.

Here, we report
an optimized RGO/Si composite via a scalable and
effective method shown in Figure 1. Si nanoparticles with controllable size are uniformly
supported by the graphene nanosheets to form a 3D network. The increased
specific surface area and enhanced intermolecular interactions at
solid-state result in a remarkable increase in specific capacity and
cycle stability. This kind of anode material opens a way to the high-stability
LIBs.

RGO/Si composite.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Structural Characterization
The XRD
patterns of P–Si and RGO/Si composites at different conditions
are shown in Figure 2. The sharp peaks of P–Si and RGO/Si samples at 28.5°,
38°, 57°, 69.5°, and 76.6° are assigned to (111),
(220), (311), (400), and (331) planes of crystalline Si (PDF#05-0565).33,34 In addition, RGO exhibited characteristic peaks at 27° which
belong to the (002) plane.35 Obviously,
it can be found that the peaks at (002) were enhanced due to the increased
content of graphene in the RGO/Si composites compared to the P–Si.
It also can be seen that the crystal structure of Si nanoparticles
was not destroyed during the self-assembly and hydrothermal process.
Moreover, compared to 10RGO/Si, the peaks of silicon in the 10RGO/Si-600
have obviously increased, whereas the carbon peak has no change, indicating
that the annealing process further promoted growth of the silicon
grains and enhanced the intermolecular interaction between graphene
and Si nanoparticles.

Figure 2 XRD patterns of P–Si and different RGO/Si composites.

The XPS test was carried out to analyze the surface
chemical state
of the composites and the role of calcination. In the survey spectra
of 10RGO/Si and 10RGO/Si-600 (Figure 3a), the elements, O, C, and Si arise from graphene
nanosheets and Si nanoparticles, which is different with the P–Si
(Figure S1). To further illustrate the
role of calcination, we applied the XPS region spectra of C 1s and
Si 2p for 10RGO/Si and 10RGO/Si-600. From the C 1s region of the 10RGO/Si-600,
there are four peaks (Figure 3b) of 284.4, 285.0, 286.0, and 289.4 eV, which can be assigned
to C–Si, C–C, C–O, and C=O bands, respectively.
Moreover, from the Si 2p region of the 10RGO/Si-600 (Figure 3c), three evident peaks at
99.8, 101. 2, and 103.9 eV could be attributed to the Si–Si,
Si–C, and Si–O bands. Compared with the C 1s and Si
2p region of 10RGO/Si, the additional C–Si and Si–C
band revealed the formation of chemical bond linkage in RGO/Si nanocomposite.36,37 This kind of optimized nanocomposite after calcination is beneficial
to improve the electrochemical performance because of the increased
specific surface area and enhanced intermolecular interaction.38,39 To demonstrate the changes of the specific surface area, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) test was applied (Figure S2 and Table S1). It can be found that the specific
surface area of the 10RGO/Si (482 m2/g) composite is an
order of magnitude higher than the P–Si (30 m2/g).
Furthermore, the specific surface area of 10RGO/Si-600 (539 m2/g) is further increased after the calcination process, indicating
the optimization of the composite structure, which is a critical point
for the enhanced cycling stability.

(a) survey scan, (b)
region spectra of C 1s, and (c) region spectra of Si 2p.

The morphology of the GO, P–Si, and RGO/Si composites
were
characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Figure 4c, 10RGO/Si showed
the typical composite structure, indicating that the pure silicon
nanoparticles were attached on the surface of graphene to further
interconnect into the 3D conductive skeleton network. It can be clearly
observed that the 10RGO/Si showed the better 3D network with the uniformly
distributed Si nanoparticles than 5RGO/Si and 15RGO/Si (Figure S3a,b). After high-temperature calcination
at 600, the 10RGO/Si-600 composite presented a more dense structure,
which is beneficial to optimize the transport path for both electrons
and electrolyte ions and keep good electrical contact during Si alloying
and dealloying process, resulting in an increase of storage capacity
and cycling stability.40

oxide; (b) P–Si; (c) 10RGO/Si,
and (d) 10RGO/Si-600.

Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) was further used to analyze
the microstructures of P–Si and 10RGO/Si-600. As shown in Figure 5a, P–Si exhibit
an average size of about 60 nm with a certain degree of aggregation.
From the TEM image of 10RGO/Si-600 (Figure 5b) at the same ruler, Si nanoparticles were
supported on the surface of graphene. Furthermore, the high-resolution
TEM images (Figure 5c,d) showed that the optimized 10RGO/Si-600 composite can form a
3D network structure, which is consistent with the above SEM images.
Also, it can be found that the lattice spacing is about 0.32 nm of
Si(111) and the microstructure of graphene with high-resolution (Figure S4), which is very important for the improved
electrochemical performance due to the large specific surface area
based on the BET data. The existence of graphene can accommodate the
volume change and enhance the conductivity of lithium ions and electrons.
In addition, after high-temperature calcination, the 10RGO/Si-600
composite showed a better crystal structure and a more stable network
that can further enhance the composite conductivity and decrease the
resistance of Li+ transfer. Moreover, the energy dispersive
spectrometry (EDS) analysis was utilized to confirm the content (Figure S5) and the distribution of each element
in 10RGO/Si-600 (Table S2), which is very
much in agreement with the aforementioned analysis.

Si and (b–d) 10RGO/Si-600 composite

2.2 Evaluation of Electrochemical Performance
The galvanostatic discharge and charge profiles of the RGO/Si electrodes
were investigated in the voltage window of 0.01–1.5 V at 0.1
A/g (Figure 6a). Usually,
the cycling stability of a Si-based electrode is investigated after
the prestabilization process by cycling at a relatively low current
density in the range of 0.1–0.4 A/g. It should be mentioned
that the cycling stability of the RGO/Si electrode was directly investigated
at 0.1 A/g without the preslow cycling process. The corresponding
initial charge capacities, discharge capacities, and the coulomb efficiencies
are displayed in Figure 6a and summarized in Table S3. As we know,
the capacity loss in the first cycle can be attributed to the formation
of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) and amorphous LixSi.41 As shown in Figures 6b and S6, the
10RGO/Si-600 and 10RGO/Si electrodes both exhibited excellent cycling
stability at the first three cycles and high initial Coulombic efficiency,
which is significantly much higher than those of other composites
and comparable to the recently reported Si-based electrodes.27,32 This is because the formed 3D network played an important role in
cycling stability and Coulombic efficiency.42

Figure 6 (a)
First charge–discharge capacity of different materials
and (b) first three charge–discharge curves of 10RGO/Si-600
at 0.1 A/g.

The cycling performance was also
studied by the galvanostatic discharge–charge
measurement within 100 circles under 0.1 and 2 A/g. From Figure 7a, although P–Si
has the highest discharge capacity of 2746 mA h/g under 0.1 A/g, the
specific capacity of P–Si rapidly decays to 500 mA h/g after
30 cycles due to the huge volume change and the low electronic conductivity
during lithiation/delithiation. We can find that all RGO/Si composites
showed a better cycle performance than P–Si. Among these, 10RGO/Si-600
showed the high initial discharge capacity of 2317 mA h/g and high
capacity retention of 85% after 100 cycles, indicating a quite high
specific capacity of 1969 mA h/g attributed to the stable 3D network.
Also, from Figure 7b, 10RGO/Si-600 exhibited a better cycling stability than 10RGO/Si
after 100 cycles at 2A/g. Meanwhile, 10RGO/Si-600 showed a higher
specific capacity of 728 mA h/g than 10RGO/Si of only 285 mA h/g.
Based on the summary and comparison of the recent GO/Si anode (Table S5), the 10RGO/Si-600 composite showed
a much higher specific capacity after 100 cycles at 0.1 A/g and is
comparable to the best anode materials after 100 cycles at 2 A/g.
It is because the optimized 3D network leads to an increase in the
specific surface area and intermolecular interaction, which is very
important for electrochemical performance.43,44 This kind of optimized graphene/Si nanocomposite holds great promise
for the future LIB application.

Figure 7 Cycle performance of (a) P–Si and
RGO/Si composites under
0.1 A/g and (b) 10RGO/Si and 10RGO/Si-600 under 2 A/g current.

Furthermore, the 10RGO/Si-600 electrode also shows
an excellent
rate capability (Figure S7 and Table S4), as estimated by varying the applied
current densities of 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 1 A/g, respectively. When
the current density is increased from 0.1 to 1 A/g, 70% of the initial
reversible capacity (∼1730 mA h/g) is maintained. Even though
the 10RGO/Si-600 electrode reversible capacity is recovered to about
2156 mA h/g and the capacity retention ratio is about 88%, when the
current density is back to 0.1 A/g after 25 cycles.

Figure 8 shows the
first three cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of P–Si, 10RGO/Si,
and 10RGO/Si-600 electrodes at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV/s with a
voltage range of 0.01–1.5 V (vs Li/Li+). As shown
in Figure S8, the typical lithiation/delithiation
peaks of Si nanoparticles were exhibited in their CV curves. During
the first discharge (lithiation), two cathodic peaks can be observed.
One peak is around 0.8 V due to the formation of an SEI layer, which
disappears in the following cycles, indicating that the SEI layer
is stable. Another peak below 0.15 V is assigned to the preliminary
conversion of crystalline Si transfer to an amorphous phase (LixSi) and the ultimate formation of the crystalline
phase (Li15Si4). For the first charge process
(delithiation), two anodic peaks at 0.37 and 0.54 V are corresponding
to the transformation from Li15Si4 alloy to
amorphous Si. With the subsequent cycling, the cathodic peak moves
to about 0.1 V, indicating that only the amorphous phase (LixSi) is formed, and two anodic peaks (0.37 and 0.54
V) represent the extraction of Li+ from LixSi to amorphous Si.45−47 Both the 10RGO/Si and
10RGO/Si-600 electrodes exhibit similar CV behavior. For the 10RGO/Si-600
composite, the second CV curve of the 10RGO/Si-600 electrode almost
coincides with the third curve, and the decrease of the peak current
below 0.1 mA in the cathodic curves is much less than that for the10RGO/Si
electrode, indicating that the stability and good reversibility of
the charging/discharging of the 10RGO/Si-600 (Figure 8a) electrode is better than that for the
10RGO/Si (Figure 8b)
electrode.

Figure 8 CV curves of (a) 10RGO/Si and (b) 10RGO/Si-600 at the first three
cycles with the enlarged view in the inset.

The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments of
P–Si, 10RGO/Si, and 10RGO/Si-600 were carried out to further
discuss the electrical conductivity performance (Figure 9a). All Nyquist plots show
similar shape with a semicircle in the high-frequency region and a
straight line in the low-frequency region. The semicircle in the high-frequency
region is assigned to the transportation barrier effect as a result
of the confronted SEI and shows the presence of graphene, and a straight-line
in the range from the medium to low frequency is a result of the diffusive
behavior of Li+ ions. These resistances included the resistance
of ion transportation within the electrolyte solution (Re) and the charge-transfer resistance (Rct).48 As we all know, the
charge-transfer resistance of 10RGO/Si-600 electrode is 53.1 Ω,
which I slower than the 124.2 Ω of the 10RGO/Si and 196 Ω
of the P–Si, indicating the higher electrochemical activity
of 10RGO/Si-600 than that of other composites after 100 cycles (Figure 9b), which is consistent
with the result of the cycling test.

electrodes (a) before
and (b) after 100 cycles.

The microstructures of P–Si, 10RGO/Si, and 10RGO/Si-600
electrodes were characterized by SEM after 100 cycles (Figure 10). Obviously, the microstructure
of P–Si has been severely damaged and pulverized, whereas the
10RGO/Si and 10RGO/Si-600 electrodes showed better surface structure
after 100 cycles. Especially, the microstructure of 10RGO/Si-600 was
more integrated than 10RGO/Si due to the enhanced intermolecular interaction
between graphene and Si nanoparticles after the calcination process,
resulting in an increase of cycling stability.

10RGO/Si and (b) 10RGO/Si-600 electrodes

3 Conclusions
The optimized RGO/Si composite
has been successfully prepared by
an effective method for high-performance LIB application. TEM and
EDS measurements showed that the silicon nanoparticles were uniformly
distributed on the surface of RGO, which can form a 3D network resulting
in an increase of the electronic conductivity and structural stability
for the anode material. The 10RGO/Si-600 composite shows excellent
initial special capacity of 2317 mA h/g with initial Coulombic efficiency
of about 93.2% at a current density of 0.1 A/g. The special capacity
remains at 728 mA h/g after 100 cycles at 2 A/g, indicating a high
rate cycle stability. The remarkable electrochemical performance can
be attributed to the stable 3D structure, which can effectively improve
the electroperformance and buffer the volume expansion during the
cycling process. This work opens up a new method for making advanced
graphene/Si nanocomposites for high stability LIBs.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Sample Preparation
All reagents,
unless otherwise stated, were obtained from commercial sources (Sigma-Aldrich)
and used without further purification. Graphene oxide was synthesized
by the modified Hummers method.49 The preparation
process of the optimized RGO/Si nanocomposite is as follows. First,
the as-prepared graphene oxide (0.05, 0.1, 0.15 g) was dispersed in
50 mL of absolute ethanol under high-power ultrasonic stirring technology
for 1 h at room temperature. Then, the preprocessed silicon (0.95,
0.90, 0.85 g) was slowly added into the above solution under magnetic
stirring. After that, the self-assembled RGO/Si solution was acquired
by mild stirring for 2 h and dialysis in absolute ethanol several
times (12 h per time) at room temperature to remove the unassembled
Si particles.50,51 Then, the self-assembled solution
was transferred to the reaction still for hydrothermal reduction for
3 h at 80 °C by a certain amount of sodium borohydride to obtain
RGO/Si. In the experiment, the different quality ratios of the RGO/Si
samples were denoted as xRGO/Si (x = 5, 10, 15). In addition, the 10RGO/Si composite was calcined at
600 °C for 4 h with argon atmosphere in a tube furnace to further
optimize the nanostructure and enhance the interactions, which was
marked as 10RGO/Si-600. Finally, the optimized RGO/Si composites as
the working electrode were assembled into half coin cell. In contrast,
the unmodified silicon was marked as P–Si. The whole preparation
process of the optimized RGO/Si composite can be defined as the templated
assembly method, which can be applied for similar nanotemplated platform
and Si composite.

4.2 Materials Characterization
X-ray
diffraction (D/MAX-Ultima IV, Japan) was carried out with Cu Kα
radiation in the 2θ range from 10° to 80°. The particle
morphology and microstructure were characterized by field emission
SEM (S-3400, Japan), TEM (FEI Tecnai G2 F20 s-twin 200 kV) with an
energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analyzer. The chemical oxidation
valence states of the samples were performed through X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi). The BET (3H-2000PS1,
Beishide Instrument) test was applied for the specific surface area.

4.3 Electrochemical Analysis
The prepared
RGO/Si composite materials were mixed with carbon black and a binder
(sodium carboxymethyl cellulose) with a mass ratio of 70:15:15 for
several hours. Then, the slurry was coated on a copper foil at a mass
loading of around 1.5 mg/cm2. The prepared electrodes were
vacuum dried at 80 °C for 10 h. Finally, the electrodes were
cut into disk shape; a CR2032 cell was assembled in an argon-filled
glove box, taking lithium metal as the counter and reference electrodes
and microporous polypropylene (Celgard 2400) as the separator. The
electrolyte of half cells was 1 M LiPF6 in a mixture of
ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate with a volume ratio of 1:1,
and adding 5% fluoroethylene carbonate. Half coin-cells were assembled
in an Ar-filled glove box with the moisture and oxygen level below
0.1 ppm and then rested for 24 h. The galvanostatic charge–discharge
tests were measured on a battery testing system (Neware, BTS7.5, China)
at room temperature (25 °C ± 1 °C) under a voltage
range of 0.01–1.5 V versus Li/Li+. CV measurements
were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (CHI670D, CH Instruments)
at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV/s in a voltage range of 0.01–1.5
V. The EIS measurements were also conducted by electrochemical workstation
CHI670D with an amplitude of 5 mV at the frequency range from 0.01
Hz to 100 kHz.
