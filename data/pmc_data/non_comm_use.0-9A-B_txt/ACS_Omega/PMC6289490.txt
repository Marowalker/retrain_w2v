Four compounds, the flavone linarin
(1), the triterpene
lupenone (2), the tocopherol (vitamin E, 3), and the new natural alkaloid 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1,1-dimethyl-6,7-isoquinolindiol
(affineine, 4), were the major natural products isolated
from Zanthoxylum affine (syn. Zanthoxylum fagara, Rutaceae). Compound 1 is highly abundant in this plant and was isolated as a white precipitate
obtained from the acetone and methanol extracts. The structure of
these four compounds was established by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy
including 1H, 13C, DEPT, COSY, HSQC, and HMBC
experiments. The hexane, acetone, and methanol extracts, as well as 1, were evaluated for their potential phytotoxic effects in
pre- and post-emergent assays, as well as to identify their mechanisms
of action. As pre-emergent phytotoxic agents, the hexane, acetone,
and methanol extracts inhibited germination and residual growth (root
and stem elongation) of Lactuca sativa (lettuce) and Lolium perenne (perennial
ryegrass). As post-emergent agents, they inhibited dry biomass. Compound 1 acts as a pre-emergent herbicide, by inhibiting germination,
seed respiration, residual seedling growth and, notably, root hair
development. Furthermore, 1 inhibited the synthesis of
ATP and the electron transport chain of isolated spinach chloroplasts;
in this way, it behaves as a Hill reaction inhibitor. The site of
inhibition was located at the donor site of PSII from the oxygen evolving
complex to QA, thus acting as a multisite compound. These
results suggest that compound 1 can be used as a lead
for a potential green herbicide with different targets.

Introduction
The interaction of
plants with different organisms has resulted
in the development of defense mechanisms such as the production of
secondary metabolites. These are synthesized in the roots, stems,
leaves, and flowers.1 A wide array of biologically
active secondary metabolites possesses a variety of natural functions;
among these functions is their potential use as pesticides in agriculture.2 These characteristics make secondary metabolites
excellent candidates for obtaining compounds with herbicidal properties,
which, ideally, exhibit biological activities at lower concentrations
than those derived from chemical synthesis.3

The genus Zanthoxylum is the
most
primitive member of the Rutaceae family. This genus is a large and
complex group of small trees and shrubs composed of about 250 species,
mainly growing in tropical and temperate regions of the world.4,5 Many of its species are used as food or as therapeutic remedies
and are known to produce a variety of biologically active secondary
metabolites including alkaloids, terpenes, lignans, steroids, coumarins,
and flavonoids.6,7 Additionally, there are reports
of Zanthoxylum species with bactericidal,8,9 insecticidal,10−12 fungicidal,13,14 nematicidal,15,16 and allelopathic activities.17−19 For example, the allelopathic
effects of the aqueous leaves’ extract of Zanthoxylum
bungeanum on the germination rate of Medicago sativa, Lactuca sativa, and Raphanus sativa have been evaluated;
and the results showed an inhibitory activity (80, 70, and 90%, respectively)
at 25 or 50 g L–1.18 The
compound xanthoxyline was isolated from the fruits of Zanthoxylum limonella, which showed inhibitory effects
against the germination of Amaranthus tricolor and Echinochloa crus-galli.17 Aqueous extracts (10% w/v) of leaves and stems
of Zanthoxylum schinifolium showed
a concentration-dependent inhibitory activity against germination
and seedling growth of Triticum sativum (wheat).19Zanthoxylum
affine is a shrub widely distributed in America, particularly
in Florida, northern Mexico, the Caribbean, Guatemala, Colombia, and
Brazil. This species is found in the tropics and semidesert zones.20,21 Phytochemical studies of Z. affine reported laurifoline, magnoflorine,20 skimmianin, scopoletin,7 synephrine,22 castanaguyone,23 and
meridinol24 as its secondary metabolites.
Biological activities have been reported for these species including
antibacterial,21,25 larvicidal,26 and antifungal properties.5,21 The plant–plant
and plant–microorganisms interactions make the synthesis of
some of these secondary metabolites possible by plants, and therefore,
it is highly probable to find in this work a new natural lead with
potential herbicide activity. The aim of this research was to evaluate
the phytotoxic potential of the Z. affine organic extracts, and its major constituent linarin (1), on L. sativa and Lolium perenne seeds and plants, in pre- and post-emergent
assays, additionally, to know if 1’s behavior
can be used as a potential herbicide and to identify its possible
mechanisms of action as plant growth inhibitor.

Results and Discussion
Identification
of the Chemical Compounds
Four compounds
were isolated as major natural products from Z. affine (Figure 1). On the
basis of their NMR spectroscopic data and comparison with those reported
in literature, these compounds were identified as linarin (1),27 lupenone (2),28 vitamin E (3),29 and the new natural product affineine (4).30 The integral value of the amine hydrogen on 1H NMR spectra of 4 suggested that this product
is a protonated amine, which was confirmed by X-ray crystallography
(Figures 1, 2, and S20).

Crystallographic data for 4 has been deposited
at
the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC 1840709, Figure 2).a

Quantification of Linarin (1) in the Acetone and
Methanol Extracts
Linarin (1) was isolated as
a white precipitate directly from the acetone and methanol extracts.
The remnant proportion of 1 in all extracts was determined
by high-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry
(HPLC–MS), representing 1.42% of the acetone extract and was
not detected in the hexane and methanol extracts, according to the
analysis conditions in the section “Quantification 1) in the Acetone and Methanol Extracts”.

Pre-emergent Bioassays
Effect on Seed Germination
and Residual Seedling Growth of Mono-
and Di-cot Plants Treated with the Organic Extracts
To know
the effects of Z. affine extracts and
linarin as pre-emergent inhibitors, they were assayed at two concentrations
(50 and 100 mg L–1 extracts, and 50 and 100 μM
linarin) on germination and residual seedling growth (root and stem
elongation) of L. sativa and L. perenne. In general, L. sativa showed higher sensitivity to the extracts at 100 mg L–1, its germination being more affected by the hexane extract (61.6%),
followed by the methanol extract (46.6%) and then the acetone extract
(30.8%) (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Effect
of Z. affine extracts on
germination and residual seedling growth of L. sativa and L. perenne. Data represent the
% of inhibition (negative values) or enhances (positive values) ±
SD; n = 3, *statistical differences (p < 0.05) according to Holm–Sidak to germination and Dunn’s
to residual root and stem elongation with control value = 0%.

However, the residual root elongation
in this species was more
affected by the acetone extract with 57.5 and 51.45% at 50 and 100
mg L–1, respectively. The methanol extract also
inhibited this activity in 42.8% and the hexane extract showed minor
inhibition with 33.9%, both at 100 mg L–1. Residual
elongation of L. sativa stems were
affected by the methanol (34.2% at 100 mg L–1) and
acetone extracts (32.5 and 27.1% at 50 and 100 mg L–1, respectively), whereas the hexane extract was not active on this
test.

On the other hand, germination of L. perenne seeds was inhibited by the acetone and methanol extracts (16–25%).
The better activity of the three extracts was observed in the residual
root growth, being the acetone extract the most active with 40.6 and
64.4% at 50 and 100 mg L–1, respectively. The hexane
extract showed similar effects with 39.4 and 57.9% at the same concentrations.
The methanol extract inhibited germination in a minor grade than the
other two extracts (40.3 and 43.3% at 50 and 100 mg L–1, respectively) (Figure 3).

As linarin (1) was obtained as the major
compound
from the acetone extract and Z. affine, its effects on the germination and residual seedling growth (root
and stem elongation) on L. sativa and L. perenne were assayed. Compound 1 did
not show a dose-dependent response because at 50 and 100 μM
it inhibited seed germination of L. sativa by the same percentage, 88.6%. The effect of 1 on seed
germination, residual root development and stem development of L. perenne was minor as shown in Figure 4. Therefore, compound 1 acts specifically as an inhibitor of L. sativa species. These results suggest that the chemical composition of
each extract plays an important role in the inhibition of germination
and residual seedling growth of the species assayed.

Figure 4 Effect of linarin (1) on germination and residual
seedling growth of L. sativa and L. perenne. Data represent the % of inhibition (negative
values) or enhances (positive values) ± SD; n = 3, *statistical differences (p < 0.05) according
to Holm–Sidak to germination and Dunn’s to root and
stem elongation with control value = 0%.

According to Hanley and Whiting, the effects of a compound
on seed
germination and plant growth can vary from one plant species to another.31 One factor is the size, affinity, and permeability
of the tegument of the seed assayed. Additionally, the susceptibility
of mono- and di-cot plants species to phytotoxic compounds in laboratory
conditions depends on the physiological and biochemical characteristics
of each plant.32 It is well known that L. sativa is a plant with fast germination and shows
high sensitivity;33−35 however, the impact of the extracts was more evident
on germination of L. sativa.

As mentioned above, the permeability of tegument provides a first
barrier in protecting the embryo against phytotoxic compounds. However,
once the germination process is carried out, roots are exposed to
any chemical agent, in both species tested, residual root elongation
showed susceptibility to all extracts, especially to the acetonic
extract.

Effect of Linarin (1) on Seed
Respiration
Seed respiration of L. sativa was
decreased with linarin (1) treatment with a concentration-dependent
pattern (Figure 5)
from the 12 to 72 h. These results indicate that 1 acts
as a seed respiration inhibitor. L. sativa seed respiration was inhibited up to 70% with a concentration of
50 μM of compound 1. These results suggest that
processes related to respiration, such as glycolysis or the mobilization
of reserve carbohydrates are being limited.

Figure 5 Effect of increasing
concentrations of linarin (1)
on seed respiration of L. sativa. Seeds
previously imbibed with 0.0 (■), 12.5 (●), 25.0 (▲),
and 50.0 (▼) μM of 1 expressed as nmol O2 h–1 seed–1. Statistical differences
are significant (p < 0.05) by Tukey test, n = 3.

Because of the respiration
of seeds at 72 h of germination with
50 μM of 1 being decreased 66.7% with respect to
control, and in this time the roots of control seedlings began to
grow, microscopic observations of the roots growth on control and
treated samples showed notable differences. In Figure 6, it is shown that root hairs decreased with
compound 1 at 100 μM with respect to the control.
The root hairs, derived from root epidermal cells, have an important
function in the uptake of nutrient and water, as well as, anchoring
the root in the soil.36 Root development
involves various transcription factors, as well as plant hormones
and external factors, biotic or abiotic. These can impact root development
by modulating these morphogenetic processes.37 Therefore, linarin can acts as a natural herbicide by inhibiting,
root hair development.

h old in (a) control and (b) roots treated with linarin 100 μM

Post-emergent Bioassays
Light
Reaction of Photosynthesis in Vitro. ATP Synthesis
Because
linarin (1) can act as a pre-emergent inhibitor,
it is important to know if this compound also shows post-emergent
inhibition; in this case, we measured the ATP formation in illuminated
thylakoids in the presence of increasing concentrations of 1, and the results showed that this compound at 150 μM inhibited
ATP-synthesis by 61% (Figure 7).

Figure 7 Effect of linarin (1) on ATP synthesis. 733 μM
ATP/mg Chl·h was used as control. The data represent the mean
± SD, n = 3.

Effect of Linarin on Noncyclic Electron Transport Rate on Spinach
Thylakoids
The light-dependent photophosphorylation is coupled
to electron transport. Thus, ATP formation can be inhibited by either
blockage of the electron transport, by direct inhibition of the H+-ATPase, or by uncoupling of the ATP synthesis process from
the electron transport.38 To discern between
these mechanisms, linarin (1) was evaluated under basal,
phosphorylating, and uncoupled conditions at increasing concentrations. 1 inhibited the noncyclic electron transport in the three
conditions, with IC50 values for phosphorylating and uncoupled
electron transport of 134.5 and 150 μM, respectively, being
similar to the previously reported flavonoids quercetin, apigenin,
genistein, and eupatorin, all of them with an IC50 from
30 to 200 μM.38 Furthermore, 1 inhibited basal electron transport partially; however, the
IC50 value for this condition was not obtained (Figure 8). These results
indicate that 1 acts as a mild Hill reaction inhibitor,
measured from water to methyl viologen (MV).

Figure 8 Effect of linarin (1) on noncyclic electron transport
basal (■), phosphorylating (●), and uncoupled (▲).
Control values were 467, 933, and 1067 for basal, phosphorylating,
and uncoupled electron transport flow, respectively. The data represent
the mean ± SD, n = 3.

Effect of Linarin on Electron Flow of PSII and PSI
To locate the inhibition site of linarin (1) on the
thylakoid electron transport chain, increasing concentrations of 1 were tested on uncoupled electron transport of PSII, PSI,
and partial reactions in the presence of appropriate artificial donors
and electron acceptors, as well as inhibitors, of the electron transport
chain (Table 1).

Table 1 Effect of 1 on Partial
Reactions of PSIIa

50.0	 	266.6 ± 15.1	
100.0	 	134.0 ± 5.9	
a Data represent
the mean ± SD, n = 3.

The results indicated that 1 inhibited
100% the uncoupled
PSII measured from water to 2,5-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone (DCBQ) at
a concentration of 25 μM; and at 25 and 100 μM; inhibited
50 and 75%, respectively, the electron flow measured from water to
SiMo. It can be deduced that the principal inhibition site of linarin
is located from the water splitting enzyme to QA because SiMo accepts
electrons close to the nonheme iron in PSII.40 When increasing concentrations of 1 were assayed on
PSI electron transport rate from reduced 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol
(DCPIP) to MV, the results showed no-effect at any of the concentrations
tested (data not shown). These results indicate that linarin inhibits
at the donor site of PSII from the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) to
QA.

Effect of Organic Extracts and Linarin (1) on dry
Biomass of Mono- and Dicot Plants
To know and to compare
the activities between the organic extracts of Z. affine and linarin (1) as potential post-emergence herbicides,
they were sprayed on L. sativa and L. perenne plants after 15 days of growth in the
greenhouse. The hexane extract did not affect dry biomass. The acetone
extract at 100 mg L–1 inhibited the L. sativa biomass by 19.1%, with significant differences
(p < 0.05), however in L. perenne the results were not significant. The methanol extract only significantly
affected the dry biomass (25.4%) of L. perenne at 100 mg L–1 (Table 2).

Conclusions
Linarin (1), lupenone (2), vitamin E
(3), and affineine (4) are the major natural
products isolated from Z. affine’s
aerial parts. Compound 4 is reported as natural product
for the first time. Compound 1 was obtained by precipitation
directly from the acetone and methanol extracts from this plant, with
1.42% remaining in the acetone extract, and it was not detected in
the hexane and methanol extracts.

Compounds 2 and 3 were identified from
the hexane extract, and compound 4 was isolated from
the methanol extract. Additionally, the extractś activity shown
could be attributed to these compounds, respectively.

In the
pre-emergence assays all three extracts from this natural
source showed phytotoxic potential. In germination of L. sativa, the hexane extract was the most active;
however, the root elongation in both species (L. sativa and L. perenne) was most inhibited
by the acetonic extract.

Linarin (1) showed pre-
and post-emergent inhibitory
activities. As pre-emergent, 1 acted as germination and
respiration inhibitor in L. sativa being
selective for this dicotyledon plant. The microscopy observations
showed that this compound inhibited root hair development, probably,
because it affects transcription factors as well as plant hormones,
so more experiments are needed.

As an in vitro post-emergent
inhibitor, compound 1 acts on the photosynthetic electron
flow inhibiting the PSII from
the OEC to QA although in vivo results are not concluding.
These results suggest that 1 can be used as a lead for
a potential green herbicide formulation with different targets.

Experimental
Section
Plant Material
Aerial parts of Z. affine were collected from Atotonilco el Grande, Hidalgo, Mexico, in January
2015 and identified by M. Sci. Ramiro Rios Gómez, Facultad
de Estudios Superiores Zaragoza, UNAM. A voucher specimen (number
FEZA-16960) was deposited at the Facultad de Estudios Superiores Zaragoza
Herbarium.

Extraction, Isolation, and Chemical Characterization
of the
Major Compounds from Z. affine
Dried aerial parts of Z. affine (2.26
kg) were powdered and exhaustively extracted by maceration at room
temperature with hexane, acetone, and methanol. During solvent recovery
of the acetone and methanol macerates, a white precipitate was obtained
(3.75 g total yield). For hexane, no precipitate was found. Residual
macerates, excluding the precipitate, were considered as extracts,
yielding the hexane (29.4 g), acetone (37.6 g), and methanol (92.3
g) extracts.

The white precipitate structure was characterized
on a Varian Mercury 400 MHz spectrometer by 1H, COSY, HMBC
and HSQC NMR (400 MHz), 13C NMR, and DEPT (100 MHz) experiments,
performed at 25 °C in deuterated dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO-d6) and with chemical shifts referenced to tetramethylsilane
(TMS) as internal standard (δ = 0). The obtained data and the
comparison of its physical (melting points), spectroscopic, and spectrometric
properties with those reported in literature identified this compound
as linarin (1).27 This same
procedure was used to identify lupenone (2, 37 mg)28 and vitamin E (3, 35 mg),29 isolated by means of column chromatography (CC,
hexane/acetone 9:1 and hexane/acetone 85:15) from the hexane extract
and also to identify the alkaloid affineine (4, 1.1 g),30 isolated by CC (acetone/MeOH 8:2) from the methanol
extract. Suitable crystals of compound 4 were obtained
from a 9:1 ratio mixture of CH2Cl2/MeOH, and
its structure was confirmed by X-ray analysis (CCDC 1840709).41

Quantification of Linarin (1) in Acetone and Methanol
Extracts
Linarin (1, 2 mg mL–1) and the extracts (6 mg mL–1) dissolved in methanol
were analyzed by HPLC–Q-TOF-MS (Agilent G6545, USA) using a
C18 1.8 μm, 2.1 × 50 mm column. A multigradient
program with 0.01% formic acid in H2O–methanol at
0.4 mL min–1 was used as mobile phase. The complete
chromatographic process was carried out at 25 °C, and the injection
volume was 3 μL. The initial ratio (8:2) was conserved for 3
min, a first gradient was used to reach a 5:5 ratio at minute 5, a
second gradient was applied to reach a 1:9 ratio at minute 6.5, flux
was conserved until minute 10. At minute 10.1, the mobile phase was
changed to an 8:2 ratio and maintained for 1 more minute. MS parameters
were established as follows: 175 V for the fragmentor, 320 °C
for gas, capillary voltage of 3500 V, and the data were acquired on
negative MS scan mode (100–700 m/z). A criterion of 5000 counts was used to integrate the chromatograms.
The linarin (1) sample was identified by its M, M –
H, M + Cl and M + HCOO ions; and they were used to establish the retention
time and chromatographic profile for this compound. Using this chromatographical
data and the presence of the above-mentioned ions, linarin was quantified
in each extract. The samples were analyzed by triplicate and reported
as percentage of 1.

General Procedure to Prepare
Extracts and Linarin (1) for Evaluations
Each
dry extract and linarin (1) were re-dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO) to prepare stock
solutions at concentrations of 10 g L–1 (extracts)
and 20 mM (1). The quantity of DMSO used in each assay
was less than 1% (v/v). Aqueous solutions of extracts and 1 (50 and 100 μM) were prepared from the stock solution to assay
the pre-emergent and post-emergent activity to obtain the desired
concentrations.

Additionally, 0.02% (v/v) of polysorbate 20
was used as surfactant in the post-emergent assays. 50 μM DCMU
in deionized water with polysorbate 20 (0.02% v/v) was prepared as
a positive control.

All negative controls were prepared by adding
the major volume
of DMSO (less than 1% of DMSO) in each assay used in the preparation
of samples.

Pre-emergence Assay
Seed Germination
Forty seeds of L. sativa as a model
of dicotyledonous plant and L. perenne as a model of monocotyledonous plant33 were disinfected with a commercial solution of 10% sodium hypochlorite
for 15 min in a VWR orbital shaker at 200 rpm, and then the seeds
were rinsed with sterile deionized water (×3) and placed in Petri
dishes (100 × 15 mm) using filter paper as support. Extracts
or linarin (1) were added (final volume 10 mL). All treatments
were performed by triplicate in the dark at 28 °C in a chamber
(Amber Hi-Lo Mod. 3554-37), 6 days for L. sativa, and 10 days for L. perenne. Germinated
seeds were taken into account after 1 mm of root protrusion. Additionally,
the length of root and stem was measured and reported as residual
growth.38,40,41 Each assay
was carried out in triplicate, the experiment included three independent
(Petri dish) replicates per treatment in a completely randomized design.
Control seed dishes contained the same amount of seeds, volume of
water, and DMSO (less than 1%) as the test solutions. Germination
and residual seedling growth values (root and stem elongation) are
expressed as a percentage of difference with respect to the control.
Thus, zero represents the control, positive values represent growth
stimulation and negative values represent growth inhibition.

Respiration
Seed respiration evaluation was carried
out similar to the germination assay, but without filter paper as
support. The Clark-type electrode coupled to a biological oxygen (YSI
model 5300A, Yellow Spring Instrument) measured O2 uptake
after 12, 24, 48, and 72 h of treatment with linarin (1). The electric current generated during O2 reduction
to water was converted to voltage; this current was stoichiometrically
related to the oxygen consumed by the cathode, and the signal was
registered on a chart recorder. The O2 consumption rate
was calculated by the equation  

The rate was calculated as nmol O2·h–1·seed–1 (where
20 cm on the recorder paper corresponded to 1200 nmol O2 and “γ” corresponded to the recorded distances
in cm when the O2 uptake of seeds in aqueous medium occurred)
and was reported as percentage of seed respiration.

Post-emergence
Assay
Determination of Dry Biomass
Fifty seeds of each model
plant were placed in pots (12 cm diameter) containing a mixture of
soil/peat-moss/Agrolita perlita (50:25:25 v/v). All pots were watered
on alternating days. In addition, they were maintained near to field
capacity in a greenhouse at room temperature (25–30 °C)
with natural day/night illumination (12/12 h). After 15 days of emergence,
they were selected and divided into three groups of plants of similar
size: (1) experimental, (2) positive control, and (3) negative control.
Then, plants were sprayed manually with a solution of one of the extracts
or linarin (1) containing polysorbate 20 (0.02% v/v)
as the surfactant. As a positive control, plants were sprayed with
a solution containing polysorbate and DCMU, and as a negative control,
they were sprayed with a solution containing polysorbate and less
than 1% (v/v) of DMSO. After 15 days, the extracts or compound were
sprayed on plants; the aerial parts of all plants for each treatment
were harvested at ground level and dried at 65 °C in a chamber
(Binder series FD model 23). The dry biomass was weighed (resolution
0.1 mg) until all constant weight.

Chloroplast Isolation and
Chlorophyll Quantification
Intact chloroplasts were isolated
from spinach leaves (Spinacia oleracea L.) by homogenization and differential
centrifugation as previously reported.42,43 Chloroplasts
were suspended in 50–200 μL of the following medium:
400 mM sucrose, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, and 30 mM tricine-KOH
(pH 8.0), and they were stored as a concentrated suspension in the
dark at 4 °C, until use. The chlorophyll (Chl) concentration
was determined according to Strain.43

Determination of ATP Synthesis
ATP synthesis measurements
were made in freshly lysed chloroplasts (20 μg/mL Chl) by osmotic
rupture in a nonbuffered solution containing: 100 mM sorbitol, 10
mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM KCN, 50 μM MV as electron
acceptor, 1 mM Na+-tricine (pH 8.0), 1 mM adenosine diphosphate
(ADP) (pH 6.7), and the extract or linarin (1). The pH
was adjusted to 8.0 with 50 mM KOH, and the mixture was illuminated
with a LED lamp of blue light (460–482 nm) for 1 min. ATP synthesis
was determined as an increase of pH from 8.0 to 8.1 during the illumination
of chloroplasts, using a microelectrode connected to a potentiometer
with expanded scale. The synthesized ATP was calculated as micromoles
of ATP per milligram of Chl per hour and reported as ATP synthesis
(%).

Determination of Noncyclic Electron Transport Rate
Noncyclic electron transport (basal, phosphorylating, and uncoupled)
was polarographically determined, illuminating chloroplasts (20 μg
Chl mL–1) during 1 min in a medium containing 50
μM of MV as an electron acceptor and monitored by a Clark electrode
coupled to a biological oxygen monitor.44 Prior to each experiment, chloroplasts were lysed, to yield free
thylakoids, by incubating them in the following basal electron transport
medium: 100 mM sorbitol, 10 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM
KCN, and 30 mM tricine (N-tris[hydroxymethyl]methylglycine)
buffer (pH 8.0 with the addition of KOH). Noncyclic photophosphorylation
electron transport was measured using the basal electron transport
medium with the addition of 1 mM ADP and 3 mM KH2PO4. Uncoupled electron transport was tested in the basal transport
medium by adding 6 mM NH4Cl as an uncoupler agent.45 Results are expressed as μequivalents
of e–·mg–1·Chl·h–1.

Electron Flow Assays: Uncoupled Photosystem
II (PSII) and Uncoupled
Photosystem I (PSI)
These assays were performed using the
same methodology as noncyclic electron transport. Reactions from water
to DCPIP of uncoupled PSII were measured by the reduction of DCPIP-supported
O2 evolution without MV. The medium contained 1 μM
2,5-dibromo-6-isopropyl-3-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DBMIB), 100 μM
DCPIP, 300 μM K3[Fe(CN)6], and 6 mM NH4Cl. Partial reactions of PSII electron transport rate from
water to sodium silico molybdate (SiMo) were also determined; the
medium without MV was supplemented with 200 μM SiMo, 10 μM
DCMU, and 6 mM NH4Cl. SiMo accepts electrons close to the
nonheme iron in PSII.39 The uncoupled PSI
electron transport was determined in medium with MV, plus 10 μM
DCMU, which inhibits PS II at QB level, 100 μM DCPIP, 300 μM
ascorbate, and 6 mM NH4Cl. Results are expressed as μequiv.
e–·mg–1·Chl.

Statistical
Analysis
All experiments were conducted
in triplicate; statistical analysis was performed using Sigma Stat
3.5 software. Germination and residual seedling growth data of each
experiment (extracts and linarin) were analyzed by Kruskal–Wallis;
statistical differences between treatments were compared by Holm–Sidak
and Dunn’s method, respectively. Respiration and dry biomass
data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA, followed by comparison of mean
values using Tukey method. For all analysis, a p <
0.05 value was taken as significant.
