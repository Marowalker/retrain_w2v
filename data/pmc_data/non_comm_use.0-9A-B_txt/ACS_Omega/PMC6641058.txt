Introduction
Electron-withdrawing
groups (EWGs) can be introduced to efficiently
modify the properties of organic compounds.1,2 The
highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) levels are lowered by these groups, resulting
in electron-poor materials, which are useful for various applications
ranging from n-type transistors to rechargeable batteries.3

Attaching two or more cyano groups to acenes
has been found to
be a particularly useful strategy. Cyano groups exhibit large electron-withdrawing
effects and additionally favor a dense, face-to-face molecular packing,4−7 which is of utmost importance for efficient charge transport in
organic materials.1,2,8 Moreover,
the cyano group is thermally very stable, enabling material processing
at elevated temperatures.

A low-cost one-pot synthesis, which
has been developed in our group,
allows for a straightforward preparation of such cyanated acenes from
quinones in two steps (Scheme 1).4,7,9,10 In the first step of the synthesis, the carbonyl
groups are converted into silylated cyanohydrins using trimethylsilyl
cyanide (TMSCN) and a cyanide salt catalyst such as KCN. In the second
step, PBr3 is added for the reductive aromatization, yielding
the cyanated acenes. 6,13-Dicyanopentacene and 5,7,12,14-tetracyanopentacene
have been recently prepared by this reaction.7 Both compounds exhibit very low LUMO levels, enabling electron transport
in organic thin-film transistors even under ambient conditions. However,
the solubility of these cyanated pentacenes is very low, rendering
their purification by flash chromatography difficult and processing
from solution impossible.

Scheme 1 One-Pot Synthesis of Cyanated Acenes from
Quinones in Two Steps via
Silylated Cyanohydrin Intermediates
The solubility of acenes depends not only on the functional
groups
but also on the size of the aromatic π-system.11 Shrinking the size of acenes improves their solubility.
Unfortunately, a smaller π-system also results in higher LUMO
levels.12 An increased number of EWGs per
ring is required to compensate this effect. Attaching two additional
cyano groups to the well-investigated 9,10-dicyanoanthracene (DCA)
may appear as a reasonable approach; a straightforward synthesis of
such tetracyanoanthracenes has been reported.13 However, these compounds do not exhibit satisfying solubility despite
the smaller aromatic π-system. Attaching alkylated electron-withdrawing
groups, such as imides, improves the solubility,14 but the insulating alkyl chains can deteriorate the charge
transport properties.15

Results and Discussion
The aim of this work was to develop an anthracene derivative with
a similarly low LUMO level as the cyanated pentacenes but with improved
solubility (despite avoiding functionalization with insulating alkyl
chains). Therefore, we developed the idea of attaching two nitro groups
to DCA. Similar to the cyano group, the nitro group is known for its
strong electron-attracting power and can change the electron affinity
of molecules significantly,16 which is
most promising for low LUMO levels. In addition, the nitro group exhibits
a more complex geometry (V-shaped) than the cyano group (linear),
which is expected to result in increased solubility. Moreover, the
nitro group is typically a weaker H-bond acceptor, which is also expected
to improve the solubility. In a similar approach, we could significantly
enhance the solubility of dicyanoanthracene precursors for coupling
reactions.10 As an additional advantage,
the reduction of the nitro groups to amines opens a pathway to cyanated
anthracenes with amino substituents, which may allow for further modifications
by chemical reactions.

The synthesis of cyanated acenes developed
in our group can be
used to introduce the cyano groups in the 9,10-position of anthracene
(Scheme 2). The nitro
groups were placed in the 2,7-position for two reasons. First, the
absence of a center of inversion in the resulting molecular structure
is expected to improve the solubility by decreased symmetry;17 second, the required 2,7-dinitroanthraquinone
precursor, 1, is easily accessible from anthrone on a
multigram scale.18

Scheme 2 Synthesis of 2,7-Dinitro-9,10-dicyanoanthracene 2 (with
a Supposed Mechanism); Reduction to Diamine 3; Formation
of Halogenated Byproduct 4, *Calculated Yield (2 Contaminated with 1 and 4)
However, carrying out the conversion
of 1 into 2,7-dinitro-9,10-dicyanoanthracene 2 turned out to be more challenging than expected. The reaction
immediately turned black when the KCN catalyst was added to 1 in DMF; no formation of the cyanohydrin intermediate was
observed. Luckily, carrying out the reaction in three steps instead
of two (by delayed addition of the catalyst) yielded better results
(Scheme 2, supposed
mechanism). We suppose that the electron-poor character of 1 enables the formation of one cyanohydrin per molecule without the
catalyst (step 1). This catalyst-free reaction reduces the electron-poor
character of the molecule, which prohibits the formation of the second
cyanohydrin. However, after this first step, it is possible to add
the catalyst without unwanted reactions, enabling the second cyanohydrin
to be formed (step 2). Carrying out these steps at 0 °C and using
KCN as the catalyst, full conversion to the cyanohydrin intermediate
was achieved.

Target compound 2 was formed in the
third step without
optimization of the reaction conditions, but back-formation of 1 was observed; 1 and 2 could not
be separated by column chromatography. Moreover, significant amounts
of a less polar byproduct were formed. On the basis of NMR measurements,
we assumed the formation of halogenated compound 4 (Scheme 2). X-ray diffraction
confirmed this assumption (see Supporting Information (SI); single crystals grown from CDCl3). Interestingly,
the formation of this byproduct is pointing the way for a synthesis
of halogenated acenes by reductive aromatization. As a possible mechanism,
we propose that the addition of PBr3 results in the substitution
of the intermediate O-silyl group by bromide, which
is then followed by reductive aromatization.

The formation of 4 and the back-formation of 1 were efficiently
suppressed by keeping the temperature at
0 °C overnight using a cryostat. For an optimized preparation
on a larger scale, we successfully carried out the reductive aromatization
in an ice-filled, covered Dewar flask without a cryostat. Although
the reaction was not kept at 0 °C overnight, yields of 60% were
obtained for 2 by this approach.

As expected, 2 showed good solubility in various polar
solvents, such as acetonitrile (1.5 g·L–1),
nitromethane (3.7 g·L–1), CHCl3 (1.8
g·L–1), and CH2Cl2 (4.0
g·L–1), in contrast to the cyanated pentacenes
(6,13-dicyanopentacene: 200 mg·L–1 in CH2Cl2, 5,7,12,14-tetracyanopentacene: 60 mg·L–1 in CH2Cl2).7 The selective reduction of the nitro groups was demonstrated
by the preparation of diamine 3 using SnCl2 as the reagent (Scheme 2).

The desired dense, face-to-face packing of 2 was revealed
by the analysis of single crystals grown from CDCl3 by
slow solvent evaporation (Figure 1). 2 Crystallizes in the Sohncke group,
P21. The absolute structure was not determined owing to
a lack of resonant scatterers. The anthracene core and the cyano groups
are virtually coplanar (maximum distance from the least squares (LS)
plane defined by the C atoms of the anthracene: 0.0885(19) Å
for N2). The nitro groups, in contrast, are distinctly twisted (maximum
distance from the LS plane: 0.4475(19) for O4). The molecules are
connected by π–π interactions to rods extending
along [100] with a distance of 3.417 Å (Figure 1C). The rods connect through the cyano and
nitro groups to the layers in the [010] direction; these layers are
connected by the nitro groups in the [001] direction (LS planes inclined
by 32.7°) (Figure 1D).

at the 50% probability levels, H atoms represented by white spheres
of arbitrary radius. (C) Rods of 2 connected by π–π
interactions. (D) Crystal structure of 2 viewed down

In an effort to grow larger single crystals of 2,
acetonitrile was found to be the best-suited solvent. Slow evaporation
yielded single-crystalline, bright yellow, needlelike crystals of
30 to several hundred micrometers in diameter (Figure 2A) and up to 1 cm in length. The same crystal
structure as from CDCl3 was obtained. Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) evinces hexagonal cross sections (Figure 2E,F) and shows tapered ends
(Figure 2D). Also,
SEM clearly underlines the high quality of the single crystals. We
do not find evidence for weathering; instead, the crystals show smooth
facets and sharp edges.

and Bravais–Friedel–Donnay–Harker
(BFDH)-predicted morphology (bottom) of single crystals of 2. Overview image (A) and details at higher magnification (B, C) with
the polarization filter turned by 90° (C); boxes highlight pleochroism
(B, C).

As expected, orienting the crystals
in the diffractometer confirmed
that the π-stacking direction nicely aligns with the length
axis of the needlelike crystals (see SI). The crystal morphology computed using the BFDH algorithm (Figure 2G–I) is in
agreement with the crystal habit observed by microscopy. These insights
allow for unambiguously determining the orientation of the molecules
within the prismatic single crystals. As mentioned above, the orientation
is important for applications in organic electronics (such as organic
single-crystal transistors) because charge transport in organic materials
preferentially occurs along the stacking direction.

The LUMO levels of 2, 3, and 4 were determined by cyclic voltammetry
(Figure 3, Table 1); DCA was measured
for comparison (also see SI). Most interestingly,
high reversibility was
observed for the reduction of 2,7-dinitro-9,10-dicyanoanthracene 2, whereas the reduction of the halogenated byproduct, 4, was not reversible at all. The high reversibility of the
reduction of dicyanoacenes was recently attributed to the delocalization
of the resulting singly occupied molecular orbital and the electron
spin density over the whole molecule.19 This effect benefits the chemical stability of the negatively charged
radical species and was shown to be valuable for applications in rechargeable
batteries. The small reduction onset potential of 2 corresponds
to a very low LUMO level of −4.22 eV. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the lowest LUMO level of any anthracene derivative reported
to date, significantly lower than the LUMO level of DCA and even lower
than the LUMO level of the alkyl imide functionalized DCAs mentioned
above.14 The similarity to the LUMO levels
of the cyanated pentacenes confirms the general strategy.

the ferrocene oxidation onset (Fc/Fc+) was determined as
the reference. All measurements were carried out in acetonitrile.

As expected, turning the electron-withdrawing nitro groups into
electron-donating amino groups resulted in a higher LUMO level of 3. However, the resulting push–pull system narrows
the optical gap and limits this effect. While 3 is a
promising building block for further chemical modifications, the very
low LUMO level and the face-to-face stacking along the crystals’
length axes render 2 most interesting for organic electronics
(in particular for n-type organic transistors). For such applications,
thermal stability is an issue and the nitro groups may raise concerns.
Fortunately, thermogravimetric analysis revealed full stability of 2 up to 211 °C (see SI). Because 2 can be easily processed from solution and processing by
thermal evaporation is not required, this is sufficient for most applications.
Glass transition or melting has not been observed by differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) measuring up to 235 °C.

Anthracene
derivatives are usually excellent fluorescence emitters,
but ultrafast intersystem crossing (ISC) from the singlet into the
triplet state was reported for nitroanthracenes.20 As a consequence, fluorescence has not been observed for
these compounds. Measurements of 2 confirmed the expected
detrimental effect of the nitro groups on the fluorescence of DCA
(see SI), which (without nitro groups)
is an excellent fluorescence emitter.10,21 Because ISC
is a prerequisite for compounds to be used as photosensitizers, the
application of 2 in photocatalysis is promising.

Conclusions
Rational molecular design of the target compound, 2,7-dinitro-9,10-dicyanoanthracene 2, allowed for the material properties to be manipulated as
desired. Increasing the number of EWGs resulted in, to the best of
our knowledge, the lowest LUMO level measured for any anthracene derivative
reported to date. Moreover, the careful selection of the substituents
and substitution positions ensured face-to-face molecular packing
and improved solubility. The packing results confirm that opposing
cyano groups significantly strengthen face-to-face interactions of
acenes.

For the synthesis of 2, the reaction from
quinones
to cyanated acenes had to be adapted to allow for the conversion of
2,7-dinitro-9,10-anthraquinone 1. The improved protocol,
which is characterized by a delayed addition of the catalyst, is expected
to be generally applicable to electron-poor starting materials. The
synthesis had to be further improved for the preparation of 2 on a larger scale.

Brominated cyanoanthracene 4 was formed as a byproduct
in the reaction toward 2. The byproduct points the way
for a synthesis of halogenated acenes from quinones by reductive aromatization.
For the preparation of 2, the formation of this byproduct
could be efficiently suppressed by the improved reaction conditions.

According to fluorescence measurements, 2 may be an
interesting photosensitizer. Moreover, selective reduction of the
nitro groups to amines was found to be feasible. Future applications
of 2 in organic electronics are most exciting, considering
the very low LUMO level, the face-to-face packing, the π-stacking
direction aligning with the crystals’ length axes, and the
large single crystals obtained from solution.

Experimental Section
Reagents and solvents for all reactions were purchased from commercial
suppliers and used without further purification, except for PBr3, which was purified by distillation. Reactions were monitored
by thin-layer chromatography (silica gel 60 F254; Merck). Column chromatography
was performed using silica 60 (40–63 μm; Merck). Solubility
data were obtained by sonicating an excess of compound 2 with 2 mL of solvent for 10 min at room temperature. The suspension
was then filtered, and 1.5 mL of the resulting solution was used to
determine the dissolved amount of 2 by evaporation of
the solvent. NMR spectra were recorded at 600 MHz for 1H and 150 MHz for 13C on a Bruker Avance III HD spectrometer
and at 400 MHz for 1H on a Bruker Avance DRX-400 spectrometer.
Data for 1H NMR are reported as follows: chemical shift
in parts per million (ppm) from tetramethylsilane (TMS) using the
residual solvent signal as an internal reference (CDCl3: δ = 7.26 ppm, DMSO-d6: δ
= 2.50 ppm), multiplicity (s = singlet, d = doublet, dd = doublet
of doublets), and integration. 13C NMR data are reported
in ppm from TMS using the central peak of the solvent as reference
(CDCl3: δ = 77.16 ppm, DMSO-d6: δ = 39.52 ppm); the multiplicity with respect to H
(s = quaternary C, d = CH) is deduced from APT experiments. HPLC measurements
were carried out on a system of Agilent Technologies (1200 Series
G1367B HiP ALS Autosampler, 1100 Series G1311A Quat Pump, 1100 Series
G1379A Degasser, 1200 Series G1316B TCCSL, 1260 Infinity G1315D DAD).
Mobile phase: water (from 95 to 1%), acetonitrile (from 5 to 99%),
formic acid (0.1%). Cyclic voltammetry measurements of 2, 3, and 4 were carried out using Metrohm
Autolab B.V equipment (PGSTAT128N, differential electrometer amplifier).
The measurements were performed at a scan rate of 0.05 V s–1 using 0.20 mM solutions in acetonitrile. Tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate
(n-Bu4NBF4, 0.1 M) was added
to the solutions as the supporting electrolyte. The solutions were
purged with nitrogen for 10 min before the measurements. A three-electrode
configuration consisting of a platinum working electrode, a platinum
counter electrode, and a silver chloride-coated silver reference electrode
was used. Ferrocene (Fc) was measured as the reference material. The
LUMO levels were deduced from the reduction onset potentials on the
premise that the ferrocene oxidation onset (Fc/Fc+) corresponds
to an energy level of −4.80 eV. UV–vis absorption spectra
were recorded at room temperature on a Thermo Scientific NanoDrop
Onec spectrometer. The measurements were carried out using
cuvettes filled with 5 μM sample solutions in acetonitrile.
Fluorescence spectra were recorded at room temperature on a PerkinElmer
LS 55 spectrometer. The measurements were carried out using 5 μM
sample solutions in acetonitrile. Excitation wavelengths maximizing
the fluorescence intensity at the emission maxima were determined
by excitation scans (2: 340 nm, 3: 450 nm, 4: 315 nm; DCA: 400 nm). Other measurement parameters: ExSlit:
2.5; EmSlit: 2.5; detector voltage: 900 (high gain), 775 (medium gain),
650 (low gain). Thermogravimetric analysis was carried out under a
flow of nitrogen at a heating rate of 10 K min–1 on a Netzsch TG 209, working with Al2O3 pans.
DSC was carried out at a heating rate of 10 K min–1 under a flowing argon atmosphere on a Netsch DSC 200 F3 Maia, working
with aluminum pans with pierced lids. Optical microscopy was performed
on a LEICA M 125 microscope; images were taken using the software
LAS v3.7. SEM was carried out with a Quanta 200F FEImicroscope. The
samples were measured at 5 or 10 kV, with a working distance of 9–10
mm and a spot size of 2.0. Before imaging, samples were loaded on
carbon-coated stubs and coated by sputtering with a 17-nm-thick layer
of Au/Pd 60/40 alloy with a Quarum Q105T S sample preparation system.
X-ray diffraction data of 2 and 4 (CCDC
entries 1530990 and 1530991) were collected at T =
100 K in a dry stream of nitrogen on a Bruker Kappa APEX II diffractometer
system using graphite-monochromatized Mo Kα radiation (λ
= 0.71073 Å) and fine-sliced φ- and ω-scans. X-ray
diffraction data were reduced to intensity values with SAINT, and
an absorption correction was applied with the multiscan approach implemented
in SADABS.22 The structures were solved
by dual-space methods implemented in SHELXT23 and refined against F with JANA2006.24 Nonhydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically.
H atoms were placed in calculated positions and thereafter refined
as riding on the parent C atoms. Molecular graphics were generated
with the MERCURY program.25

2,7-Dinitro-9,10-anthraquinone
(1)
The
synthesis followed the protocol reported by Perry et al.18 Instead of standing at room temperature for
1 week, standing overnight was found to be sufficient. The final precipitate
(after boiling in glacial acetic acid) was also filtered after standing
overnight. Intensive washing of the solid with ethyl acetate (instead
of glacial acetic acid and hexane) afforded 1 as a pale
yellow powder (7.26 g, 34%). Purification by recrystallization was
not required. 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6, δ): 8.83 (d, J = 2.3 Hz, 2H), 8.71
(dd, J = 2.3, 8.6 Hz, 2H), 8.48 (d, J = 8.6 Hz, 2H) ppm (in accordance with the literature18). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 9.19 (d, J = 2.3 Hz, 2H), 8.68 (dd, J = 2.3, 8.5 Hz, 2H), 8.58 (d, J = 8.5

2,7-Dinitro-9,10-dicyanoanthracene (2)
2,7-Dinitro-9,10-anthraquinone 1 (1491
mg, 5.00 mmol,
1.00 equiv) was suspended in dry DMF (2.50 mL, 2.0 M) under an argon
atmosphere in a 50 mL three-necked round-bottom flask (equipped with
a septum and an argon balloon). The flask was cooled to 0 °C
with an ice bath, TMSCN (1017 mg, 1.28 mL, 10.25 mmol, 2.05 equiv)
was added, and the resulting mixture was stirred at 0 °C for
90 min. Note: Magnetic stirring is difficult at this stage. Adding
larger amounts of DMF to solve this issue is not recommended; this
affects the reductive aromatization after adding PBr3.
For reactions on a small scale, stirring with a stirring rod from
time to time is recommended. For reactions on a larger scale, mechanical
stirring is recommended as an alternative. KCN (16 mg, 0.25 mmol,
0.05 equiv) was then added, and the reaction was stirred for another
3 h at 0 °C. After slowly diluting with 15 mL of dry acetonitrile,
PBr3 (1624 mg, 0.56 mL, 6.00 mmol, 1.20 equiv) was added
(still at 0 °C). The reaction was then placed in an ice-filled,
covered dewar flask and stirred overnight. The resulting suspension,
which warmed to 15 °C overnight, was diluted with 15 mL of CH2Cl2 and directly filtered over a thick pad of silica
(conditioned with CH2Cl2 and some drops of acetonitrile)
using CH2Cl2 as the eluent. After evaporation
of the solvent, the residue was purified by column chromatography
(petroleum ether/CH2Cl2 3:2 → 1:1). Evaporation
of the solvent afforded 2 (948 mg, 2.98 mmol, 60%) as
a yellow solid. 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3, δ):

(52 000), 306 (48 000), 411 (8000), 435 nm (7000 M–1 cm–1). The molecular structure
was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. DSC did not evince
melting up to the decomposition temperature.

2,7-Dinitro-9,10-dicyanoanthracene 2 (382 mg, 1.20 mmol,
1.0 equiv) and SnCl2·2H2O (2166 mg, 9.60
mmol, 8.0 equiv) were suspended in 12 mL of EtOH (0.1 M) and heated
to reflux for 4 h with an oil bath. The solvent was then evaporated
in vacuo, and the solid residue was transferred into a separating
funnel with ethyl acetate and saturated aqueous NaHCO3.
The mixture was extracted with 2 × 200 mL and 2 × 100 mL
of ethyl acetate, and the combined organic layers were dried over
sodium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvent afforded 3 (260 mg, 1.01 mmol, 84%) as a dark red solid. 1H NMR
(600 MHz, DMSO-d6, δ): 7.95 (d, J = 9.1 Hz, 2H), 7.18 (dd, J = 9.1, 2.1

2,7-Dinitro-9,10-anthraquinone 1 (1491 mg, 5.00 mmol,
1.00 equiv) was suspended in dry DMF (2.50 mL, 2.0 M) in a 50 mL three-necked
round-bottom flask (equipped with a septum and an argon balloon).
TMSCN (1017 mg, 1.28 mL, 10.25 mmol, 2.05 equiv) was added at room
temperature, and the resulting mixture was stirred for 1 h. KCN (16
mg, 0.25 mmol, 0.05 equiv) was then added, and the reaction was stirred
for another 90 min. After diluting with 15 mL of dry acetonitrile,
PBr3 (1624 mg, 0.56 mL, 6.00 mmol, 1.20 equiv) was added,
and the reaction was stirred at room temperature for 3 h. The resulting
suspension was filtered, and the solid was washed with acetonitrile
and subjected to column chromatography (petroleum ether/CH2Cl2 3:2 → 1:1), which afforded pure compound 4 as a yellow solid (128 mg, 0.34 mmol, 7%) and a mixture
(588 mg) of starting material 1 (0.39 mol %; calculated:
219 mg, 0.73 mmol, 15%), 2 (0.57 mol %; calculated: 341
mg, 1.07 mmol, 21%), and 4 (0.04 mol %; calculated: 28
mg, 0.08 mmol, 2%) (mole fractions according to 1H NMR).
