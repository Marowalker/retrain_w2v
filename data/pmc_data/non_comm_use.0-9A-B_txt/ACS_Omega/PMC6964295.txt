Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have a large number of applications
in technology and physical and biological sciences. These nanomaterials
can be synthesized by chemical and biological methods. The biological
synthesis using fungi represents a green approach for nanomaterial
production that has the advantage of biocompatibility. This work studies
silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) produced by fungi Rhodotorula
glutinis and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa found in ordinary soil of the Universidade Federal do Ceará
campus (Brazil). The biosynthesized AgNPs have a protein-capping layer
involving a metallic Ag core. The focus of this paper is to investigate
the size and structure of the capping layer, how it interacts with
the Ag core, and how sensitive the system (core + protein) is to visible
light illumination. For this, we employed SEM, AFM, photoluminescence
spectroscopy, SERS, and dark-field spectroscopy. The AgNPs were isolated,
and SEM measurements showed the average size diameter between 58 nm
for R. glutinis and 30 nm for R. mucilaginosa. These values are in agreement with
the AFM measurements, which also provided the average size diameter
of 85 nm for R. glutinis and 56 nm
for R. mucilaginosa as well as additional
information about the average size of the protein-capping layers,
whose found values were 24 and 21 nm for R. mucilaginosa and R. glutinis nanoparticles, respectively.
The protein-capping layer structure seemed to be easily disturbed,
and the SERS spectra were unstable. It was possible to identify Raman
peaks that might be related to α-helix, β-sheet, and protein
mixed structures. Finally, dark-field microscopy showed that the silver
cores are very stable, but some are affected by the laser energy due
to heating or melting.

1 Introduction
Nanoparticles are systems commonly considered to have a size of
approximately 1–100 nm; the design, synthesis, and manipulation
of this type of system are made through nanotechnology. The small
size of these materials makes them attractive for applications in
a wide range of areas. Nanoparticles, based on metals, such as Au,
Pt, Pd, and Ag, are used in health care products, cosmetics, and food,
as well as in environmental and biomedical sciences, chemical industries,
space industries, and catalysis.1,2

Several routes and chemical methods are used for the synthesis
of nanoparticles (NPs) from metal salts. However, most of them include
the use of toxic solvents that generate waste harmful to the health
and environment and result in high energy consumption in routes that
are generally complex and multistep. A promising approach to achieve
this goal is to explore the wide range of natural resources available
through the so-called green synthesis. In this context, the use of
fungi and bacteria for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs)
has been achieving rising interest over the last years. Among the
biogenic processes for the production of metallic NPs, those mediated
by fungi present high efficiency, besides simplicity and low cost.3,4 Fungi cultures, when compared to bacteria, require simpler nutrients,
produce a large amount of biomass, and are easily handled. In addition,
most of the fungi used to produce AgNPs are nonpathogenic to humans
and the presence of a capping protein layer involving the metallic
core makes these particles potentially biocompatible.5,6

The production of silver nanoparticles by fungi Rhodotorula mucilaginosa (Rm) and Rhodotorula glutinis (Rg) was previously accomplished
by Cunha et al.11,14 These fungi have a wide range
of application, e.g., in food and biodiesel industries. In the latter,
they are used to convert glycerol derivative into carotenoids, which
are important antioxidants.5−7 It should be noted that this type
of fungi could be found in a wide variety of environments, such as
fruits, wood, water, and decaying soils, which makes it relatively
easy to obtain them for cultivation in laboratories and for storage.
The feeding of fungi with sucrose or glucose creates enzymes in broth
that are easily storable and reusable according to the needs. After
separating the fungus from the enzyme broth, silver nitrate is added
to the broth and the stabilization of the nanoparticle is achieved
by the formation of a thin layer of protein cover that involves the
Ag nucleus in a mechanism that has been investigated for different
fungi.14,15 These microorganisms possess the capacity
to carry out the reduction of metal ions to metallic nanoparticles
due to the secretion of a large number of enzymes (generally proteins);
the said protein layer generates compartments capable of providing
structural, spatial, and chemical controls for the stabilization and
generation of nanoparticles.12,15 The AgNPs created by
the fungi Rm and Rg are very stable (we have AgNPs in perfect conditions
that have been stored for many months). When compared with other nontoxic
alternative methods (e.g., plants and bacteria), Rm and Rg fungi-based
methods generate a much larger amount of biomass.7−14 Plants might be used, but this method requires a place (e.g., orchards)
and a continuous maintenance; it occupies a larger space, and thus,
it is more time-consuming; bacteria culture might not be healthy because
many of them can be very dangerous for human beings. It should be
noted that it is not a straightforward answer to say which method
of green synthesis is the best; there are many variables involved
that will depend more on the protocols, materials, resources, and
biological organisms that we have at hand. Finally, the use of Rm
and Rg fungi is very convenient for this work because they are available
in abundance in the campus soil of UFC. For more details, see Cunha
et al.11,14

Despite the physicochemical and biological characterization commented
above, information about the physical, chemical, and optical properties
of the nanoparticles is still missing. In this work, we go a step
further by performing a joint microscopic–spectroscopic–optical
investigation of these nanoparticles. Atomic force and scanning electron
microscopy techniques were employed to obtain physical information
about the core and the protein layer. Statistical and comparative
studies were made using the data provided by these techniques. Chemical
and optical analyses of the AgNPs were carried out through surface-enhanced
Raman spectroscopy (SERS), photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, and
dark-field scattering. Together, they give us a greater approach on
the study of the properties and characteristics of AgNPs synthesized
by Rm and Rg fungi.

2 Experimental Details
Synthesis processes mediated by fungi R. glutinis and R. mucilaginosa were made according
to the procedure and reported by Cunha et al.14 and Noronha et al.13 The synthesis process
in the laboratory is relatively fast; at the beginning, it takes a
few days to prepare the culture and to biosynthesize the NPs, but
after that the AgNPs are stored in a well-sealed container in deionized
water in a dark, dry place at room temperature. AgNPs can be stored
for months (we have AgNPs stored for 12 months in perfect condition)
and, therefore, can be used repeatedly for applications and/or characterizations.
To use them, one just has to take the desired amount of the stored
AgNPs, sonicate, and dilute; this takes only a few hours and large
quantities can be prepared if necessary. Further details on the biogenic
synthesis are given elsewhere.10−14 A summary of the whole process is illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Summary of the synthesis process and deposition of the samples
for the AFM, SEM, and Raman characterizations.

For the Raman and AFM measurements, 10 mL of the suspension of
the stored nanoparticles was taken and sonicated for 20 min after
addition of 10 mL of deionized water (i.e., diluted AgNP suspension).
With a micropipette, one drop was deposited onto a 0.2 mm-thick glass
substrate and left to dry covered for 48 h at room temperature. An
objective lens of 100×/NA = 0.90 was used in the optical microscope
that was conjugated to a Raman spectrometer (WITec alpha300). Spectra
were acquired in a time series with an acquisition time of 1 s using
a green laser (532 nm) with a power of 10 mW. For AFM characterizations,
an Asylum Research MFP-3D-BIO atomic force microscope was used in
the tapping mode. For SEM characterization, one drop of the diluted
AgNP suspension was deposited on a silicon substrate (Si). The SEM
characterization was carried out using a Quanta 450 FEG microscope
(FEI). The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were measured for
individual particles by a confocal microscope using a CW diode laser
at 473 nm for excitation together with a laser line filter and a 490
nm long-pass filter in the detection path. Dark-field scans were recorded
using broadband (300 nm to 2.5 μm), incoherent illumination
at a shallow angle and an NA 0.7 microscope objective to collect the
elastically scattered light only. A pinhole in the detection allowed
to select the light, scatter off an individual particle, and record
its spectrum. Additionally, we illuminated the particles by a HeNe
laser at 633 nm (∼5 mW) to test the influence of laser heating
and plasmon resonance. The scattered light was either sent to an APD
single-photon counter or to a spectrometer, and a 550 nm short-pass
filter was included in the optical path to remove the laser light.

3 Results and Discussion
The SEM technique is a versatile tool that has already been successfully
employed to characterize fungal AgNPs.16−19Figure 2 presents SEM images on a silicon substrate
of the biosynthesized nanoparticles. The images show AgNPs with different
sizes and spherical shapes, although irregular spheres are also present.
For both Rg- and Rm-AgNPs, it is possible to observe isolated nanoparticles
and agglomerates. However, nanoparticles synthesized by the fungus R. glutinis (Figure 2a) tend to form aggregates on the Si substrate, while
those synthesized by R. mucilaginosa (Figure 2b) appear
well-isolated. The histograms shown in Figure 2c,d were constructed with 115 AgNPs, which
allowed to calculate the average size of 58 nm for Rg-AgNPs and 30
nm for Rm-AgNPs. Cunha et al.14 obtained
higher values for Rg-AgNPs (108 nm) and Rm-AgNPs (119 nm) using dynamic
light scattering (DLS) to analyze the same samples considered here.
This difference can be attributed to the fact that the protein layer
covering the silver core could be invisible in SEM and/or to aggregates
in the solution used for the DLS experiment.

(c) size histogram. (b) R. mucilaginosa AgNP SEM image and (d) size histogram.

Additional characterization was performed by employing atomic force
microscopy (AFM) in the intermittent contact mode (tapping). Figure 3a,b shows the AFM
topography for Rm- and Rg-AgNPs, respectively. Just like in the SEM
images above, AFM confirms that the nanoparticles synthesized by the
fungus R. glutinis tend to agglomerate
(Figure 3b). Figure 3e,f shows a histogram
of the particle sizes for Rm- and Rg-AgNPs, respectively, made with
80 particles taken from the topography images. Due to the agglomeration
of the Rg-AgNPs, their histogram has larger values for the nanoparticle
sizes than those for Rm-AgNPs. The mean sizes calculated from AFM
topography are ∼56 and ∼85 nm for Rm- and Rg-AgNPs,
respectively.

f) size histograms of the topography images.

The AFM tapping operation mode is particularly interesting for
this work since it is sensitive to different compositions through
the phase image. Besides the cantilever amplitude, the movement of
the probe can be characterized by its phase relative to a drive oscillator.
The phase signal changes when the probe finds regions of different
compositions; thus, phase imaging is a powerful tool that is sensitive
to the rigidity/smoothness of the surface, i.e., a dissipative force
between the tip and the sample surface. This allows the mapping of
surfaces to identify constituents with different hardnesses and/or
to find different materials involved. Figure 3c,d shows AFM phase images for Rm- and Rg-AgNPs,
correspondingly. Importantly, the contrast of these images demonstrates
the existence of a solid nucleus (i.e., Ag) for each nanoparticle
with a wrapping layer (i.e., protein) involving it. The donut-shaped
aspect in the phase images is not present in the corresponding spots
of the topography images shown in Figure 3a,b. These images show a profile made by
considering a horizontal line crossing the nanoparticles that is indicated
by the arrows with an FWHM of ∼21 nm attributed to the protein-capping
layer width. It should be noted that this value is the experimental
minimum limit for the NP considered since the measured profile is
a convolution of the tip diameter with the layer width. Using this
method, it is possible to estimate the width of the protein layer
biosynthesized by fungi to be approximately 24 nm for Rm-AgNPs and
21 nm for Rg-AgNPs, while the diameters of the solid core of the particle
are estimated to around 37 nm and 71 for Rm- and Rg-AgNPs, respectively.
The Rg nanoparticles tend to agglomerate; this can induce errors in
the estimation of the real sizes of Rg-AgNPs, even though the values
obtained here have good agreement with the literature.13Table 1 summarizes the analysis of the AFM and SEM measurements.

Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy is an effective technique to
study the optical properties of silver nanoparticles to evaluate potential
applications of materials, such as in photonics. PL emission spectra
are shown in Figure 4 for excitation with a blue laser (λ = 473 nm, 2.62 eV). The
spectra shown in Figure 4a,b were acquired for different nanoparticles, but all of the spectra
for the same Rg or Rm fungus species are similar, with a very broad
peak at 570 nm. Similar spectra have been reported in the literature
for AgNPs stabilized in soluble starch20 as well as for AgNPs biologically synthesized by fungi.21 Variations in the emission wavelength could
come from size deviations,22,23 but this was not observed
in the spectra shown in Figure 4a,b, indicating homogeneity in the sizes of the NPs analyzed.

SERS is an extension of Raman spectroscopy that explores the enhanced
local fields at metallic nanostructures, thus allowing for the detection
of very small amounts of sample.24 Representative
Raman spectra of the AgNPs acquired with a green laser (2.33 eV) are
shown in Figure 5c,d.
The spectra have well-defined peaks and improved sensitivity due to
the SERS effect. The most characteristic bands are associated with
the CONH group, referred to as amides I to VII, with the vibrational
assignments according to Table 2. Most of the peaks shown in Figure 5c,d are in the region from 1200 to 1700 cm–1 and could be assigned to C–O stretching, N–H
bending, and C–N stretching.25 Thus,
considering that amide II has a very weak Raman signal, the peaks
could be related mostly to amides I and III. It is not possible to
classify the proteins according to their secondary structures, i.e.,
α-helix, β-sheet, and protein mixed structures (α/β,
α + β), based on the obtained Raman spectra due to the
large amount of peaks distributed in a wide range of frequencies.
These peaks might be related to α-helix or β-sheet structures.
However, narrow and relatively intense Raman bands are found between
500 and 900 cm–1 both in M3 and G3 spectra and this
can be associated with protein mixed structures.25,26

The Raman spectra vary with time for acquisitions at the same sample
spot, even for small acquisition times. This fact was investigated
in time series measurements in a single spot, in which 100 measurements
were made using 0.1 s for each acquisition, with an elapsed time between
acquisitions of 1 s due to experimental limitations of the equipment.
The acquired spectra are shown in Figure 5a,b for Rm- and Rg-AgNPs, respectively, with
selected spectra shown in Figure 5c,d for the indicated orange lines. The peaks at around
500, 900–1000, and 1600 cm–1 might be assigned
to a shift of the NH2 twisting, wagging, rocking, and scissoring modes,
respectively, indicating an amine–silver interaction.26 Moreover, for both Rm- and Rg-AgNPs, the Raman
spectra vanish (or become too weak) after approximately 40 and 55
s, respectively. The stabilization of biogenic AgNPs results from
the capping protein structures, usually oligopeptides lying on the
surface of the nanoparticle, thus conferring stability and preventing
the oxidation of Ag0 to Ag+. Various substances
can break this energy balance, leading to the collapse of the nanoparticle.
The substances that cause this effect are those that alter the conformation
structure of the oligopeptides or alter their load content, destabilizing
the protein and consequently the silver nanoparticle. Among these,
we can mention oxidizing or reducing agents, lasers, and heat.27,28 These may be some of the facts that can explain the instability
of the Raman spectra described above; however, a relevant one to explain
the temporal fluctuations may be due to the transfer of electrons
that regulate the molecule–metal interaction under the excitation
of light. This is particularly relevant for proteins due to the complex
landscape and energy range that they possess together with the interlacing
of vibrational modes.29

Another possible explanation for the instabilities observed in
the Raman spectra might be related to modifications of the silver
core, e.g., small changes in its shape, heating, or even melting due
to the laser energy transfer. This hypothesis was verified employing
a dark-field setup equipped with an additional HeNe laser, as described
in the Experimental Details section. Dark-field
microscopy is a very useful tool to study metal particles either in
the biological or in materials science field.36,37Figure 6c shows a
dark-field APD image of Rm-AgNPs by raster scanning a sample region;
the bright points indicate the location of Rm nanoparticles. Figure 6a shows the scattered
light for the chosen spots indicated in Figure 6c with 1 s of acquisition time for every
spectrum. The image shown in Figure 6a is homogeneous, indicating the stability of the nanoparticle
under these measurement conditions. Keeping the same experimental
conditions, the HeNe laser was turned on and focused on the same sample
spot. The acquired spectra thus obtained are summarized in Figure 6b. This figure is
similar to Figure 6a up to about 75 s, which can be considered the starting time for
a decrease in the scattering intensity. Figure 6d shows three sample spectra after a delayed
time of 19, 99, and 166 s of sample exposure to the HeNe laser. It
is clear that the peaks weaken their intensities, although they do
not alter their positions and/or widths. This is good evidence that,
besides the protein conformations, the metallic cores are also affected
by the laser. It is important to comment that Rg-AgNPs exhibit a similar
behavior. Throughout both sample materials, the degree as to which
the scattering spectra were influenced by laser heating was very diverse.
A possible cause for this behavior is the diversity in the microscopic
shape of the individual particles (cf. Figure 2). Figure S1 of
the Supporting Information shows a Raman time series measurement on
the exact same samples used to acquire Figure 6 but on different particles. Due to experimental
limitations, we cannot have Raman and DF + laser in the same region,
but Figure S1 supports our DF conclusions
above by showing that the stability of the signal has the same time
scale as the DF + laser illumination in Figure 6b.

4 Conclusions
In this contribution, silver nanoparticles encapsulated by a protein-capping
layer were studied by SEM, AFM, and optical spectroscopy techniques.
These nanoparticles were produced by two fungi: R.
glutinis and R. mucilaginosa. The AFM phase image allowed the estimation of the protein-capping
layer width to be 21 nm (R. glutinis) and 24 nm (R. mucilaginosa). The
enhanced Raman spectra obtained are very unstable, indicating that
the structural conformations of the protein involving the silver core
are affected by the laser and/or by the enhanced fields from the silver
core. The results presented here allowed the identification of α-helix,
β-sheet, and protein mixed structures. The protein–silver
interaction seems to happen through the amine group. Raman spectroscopic
signatures of this group could be identified for most particles. Dark-field
measurements showed that not only the protein structure is affected
by the laser but also the silver metallic core, contributing to the
instabilities found in the Raman spectra, temporal fluctuations. Our
results are important for defining the proper applications of biogenic
nanoparticles and their limitations.
