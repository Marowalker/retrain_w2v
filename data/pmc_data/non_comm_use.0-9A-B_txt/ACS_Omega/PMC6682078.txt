Owing to the rise in antimicrobial
and chemotherapeutic drug resistance,
there is a desperate need to formulate newer as well as more effective
agents. With this perspective, here we outline the synthesis of two
novel gemini surfactants with different substitutions at the nitrogen
atom of the benzimidazolium ring. Both the compounds induced significant
reductions in Candida growth in various
yeast strains. The reduction in Candida growth seemed likely through the reduction in ergosterol biosynthesis:
a sterol constituent of yeast cell membranes. Different concentrations
of both compounds were used to determine the cellular ergosterol content
which indicates an important disordering of the ergosterol biosynthetic
pathway. Cytotoxic studies were carried out using HEK 293 (human embryonic-kidney
cells) and Galleria mellonella larvae
(an in vivo model of antimicrobial studies). Administration of both
the compounds to G. mellonella larvae
diseased by the yeast Candida albicans resulted in increased survival indicating their in vivo activity.

1 Introduction
One
of the serious problems people currently face in daily life
is their inexorable exposure to several bacteria, fungi, and many
other micro-organisms. The emergence of resistant micro-organisms
against available antimicrobial agents is a matter of serious concern.1 Persistent fungal infections are connected with
higher death/mortality rates in immuno-compromised hosts, such as
cancer patients, organ transplantation, and acquired immuno deficiency
syndrome.2 The range of effective and safer
antifungal agents is limited, despite thehigh death rate associated
with fungal infections.3 Conventional antifungal
agents, that is, fluconazole (FLC), caspofungin, and amphotericin
B have some therapeutic limits like related drug toxicity, uneven
bioavailability, and absence of oral/intravenous preparations. More
significantly, increasing resistance to the majority of the clinically
used antifungal agents has considerably minimized the outcome rate
of antifungal therapy leading to higher mortality.4 Thus, the identification of harmless and effective antifungal
agents to gear up challenges of increasing frequency/incidences of
fungal infections is immediately required.4,5 Gemini
surfactants are novel surfactants which have drawn much attention
from both academic and industrial research communities and possess
effective antimicrobial activity.6,7 These are amphiphilic
in nature having two hydrophilic moieties as well as two hydrophobic
tails joined by a spacer who may be stiff or stretchy.8−10 Gemini surfactants have improved physicochemical features like lesser
critical micelle concentration (cmc), high efficiency of adsorption,
better wetting and foaming ability, solubilizing power, as well as
soap lime-dispersing properties,11−15 wetting agent, emulsifier, fabric softener, and foaming
agents.16−19 Gemini surfactants are more efficient in reducing surface tension
and form micelles comparatively at lower concentrations as compared
to monomeric surfactants.20,21

The surfactants
with the quaternary ammonium head group have been
extensively used as antimicrobial agents over the decades.22,23 These surfactants kill the microorganisms mostly because of electrostatic
and hydrophobic interactions on the cell surfaces24 by intercalating the cell membrane and changing its molecular
organization, which increases membrane permeability and thus results
in cytoplasmic diffusion and cell lysis.25 The cytotoxicity and green behavior of the gemini surfactants are
of immense importance ahead of their use in any potential field.26−28 Although various reports are centered on their antimicrobial activities,29−31 the exact means of action is not yet completely understood. Consequently,
the main aim of this study was to design and synthesize new gemini
surfactants and evaluate their antifungal activity. Therefore, in
this work, we have synthesized two novel benzimidazolium-based gemini
surfactants 1,3-bis(1,1-dialkyl benzimidazolium)propane bromide expressed
as BG8 and BG10, respectively, and characterized by Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR), NMR, and mass spectroscopy (Scheme S1). The purity of these surfactants was checked by
high performance liquid chromatography. The physicochemical characterization
was also performed using tensiometry given in the Supporting Information. The anti-candida studies
for these compounds against three strains of Candida (Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, and Candida tropicalis) along with one fluconazole (FLC) resistant C. albicans strain were performed. The following Scheme 1 shows the probable mechanism of action of
gemini benzimidazolium surfactants with yeast membrane.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Anti-candida Studies
2.1.1 In
Vitro Anti-candida Activity
The anti-candida studies for these compounds against
three strains of Candida (C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. tropicalis) along with one
FLC resistant C. albicans strain were
performed and the results suggested that gemini benzimidazolium surfactants
showed better anti-candida potential as compared to the reference drug FLC. Both surfactants,
BG8 and BG10 also exhibited potent inhibitory activity against the
resistant strain with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value
of 23.7 and 10.9 μM, respectively, indicating that BG10 is more
effective against the resistant C. albicans strain compared with standard drug FLC (Table 1). BG8 exhibited a MIC value of 23.7 μM
against all the three sensitive strains. Moreover, BG10 was observed
to be more effective than that of BG8 and reference drug FLC 51 μM
against C. tropicalis strains with
a value of MIC 10.9 μM, respectively. Because it is renowned
that C. albicans is to blame for 50–60%
cases of the pathological condition of fungus infection (candidiasis),30,32 we concentrate our studies on the C. albicans strain. Based on the results obtained with standard Candida strains, these surfactants were further investigated
against FLC-resistant C. albicans.
Similar results were also reported by Ruiz et al.32 They reported that green cationic gemini surfactants Nα,Nω-bis(Nα,caproylarginine)α,ω-propyldiamide
(C3(CA)2) and lichenysin exhibited antimicrobial synergies against C. albicans, Bacillus subtilis, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Escherichia coli, and observed that C3(CA)2-lichenysin
exhibited lesser MIC values than the individual ones. Zhang et al.
has also reported the antibacterial as well as antifungal activities
of gemini surfactant monomers and copolymers with better MICs than
the conventional surfactants.33

2.1.2 Growth
Curve
To investigate the
impact of those potent surfactants (BG8 and BG10) on the expansion
of Candida cells, growth curve studies
were performed. Completely different concentrations of the test compounds
(2MIC, MIC, and MIC/2) were exposed on the Candida cells (Figure 1a,b).
The positive and negative controls were taken as FLC-treated cells
and untreated cells, respectively. The Candida cells do not show any noteworthy growth once exposed to MIC and
2MIC concentrations of these surfactants with the incessant lag stage
of 24 h. But, at sub-MIC concentrations of BG8 and BG10, growth has
been found after 7 and 12 h, respectively, for a standard C. albicans strain. In the case of the FLC-resistant Candida strain, growth has been observed after 10
and 14 h when exposed to sub-MIC concentrations of BG8 and BG10, respectively.
Moreover, FLC exhibited less efficacy in inhibiting the growth of
FLC-resistant Candida cells than BG8
and BG10. The above results reveal that BG10 was observed to be a
good inhibitor against Candida cell
growth as compared to BG8 as shown in Figure 1c,d.

and (b) BG10, FLC-resistant C. albicans D15.9 in the presence of (c) BG8 and
(d) BG10.

2.1.3 Synergistic
Study
The in vitro
synergistic activity of anti-candida in grouping
with FLC was also performed against standard and FLC-resistant C. albicans strains. The outcomes revealed that anti-candida activity of each surfactant BG8 and BG10 against
the standard C. albicans strain was
significantly improved when used in a mixture with FLC. The fractional
inhibitory concentration index (FICI) values of surfactants BG8 and
BG10 were 0.253 and 0.127 against the standard C. albicans strain indicating moderate synergy of BG8 and a highly synergistic
effect of BG10 (Table 2). Moreover, BG10 also exhibited potential synergistic activity with
a FICI value of 0.250 against the FLC-resistant C.
albicans strain while BG8 also shows synergy in combination
with FLC in the same strain (Tables 2 and 3).35,36

2.1.4 Ergosterol
Biosynthesis in C. albicans
The effect of these compounds
on ergosterol biosynthesis in C. albicans was examined in order to determine whether they affected cell membrane
biosynthesis. The quantitative total sterol profiling in C. albicans ATCC 90028 was determined as described
by an earlier stated method.37 FLC was
taken as the positive control. The results clearly demonstrated a
decrease in dose-dependent ergosterol content as cells were grown
in variable concentrations of BG compounds. It can be inferred from
the results that the exposure of cells to BG compounds with MIC and
MIC/2 levels expressively inhibited ergosterol biosynthesis (Figure 2a,b). However, these
compounds are comparatively less effective at low concentrations (MIC/4).
Moreover, BG8 and BG10 inhibited the total ergosterol synthesis content
more effectively than FLC at all the tested concentrations.

and MIC) of test compounds (a) BG8 and (b) BG10.

2.2 In Vivo Studies
2.2.1 Toxicity
of BG8 and BG10 Gemini Surfactants
in Galleria mellonella Larvae
Further, to evaluate the in vivo toxicity of these compounds, larvae
of Galleria mellonella were inoculated
with 20 μL of BG8 and BG10, and viability was assessed over
96 h. At concentrations ranging from 3030 to 70 μM, these compounds
were nontoxic in the G. mellonella larvae,
yielding 100 ± 0% viability after 96 h (Figure 3a,c).

surfactants in G. Mellonella larvae

2.2.2 Antifungal
Efficacy of BG Compounds in the G. mellonella Larvae
To estimate the in
vivo anti-candida efficiency of BG compounds, the G. mellonella larvae was infected by an inoculum
of C. albicans (5 × 105 per 20 μL). One hour post infection, the larvae were administered
with 20 μL of BG compounds (3030–70 μM) or 20 μL
of dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) (10% v/v) control, and viability was
assessed over 96 h. BG8 at 76 μM increased the viability of
the G. mellonella larvae to 76.66 ±
3.33% at 48 h and 53.00 ± 3.33% compared to the respective DMSO-injected
controls (48 h; 66.66 ± 3.33%, 72 h; 33.33 ± 6.66%). BG8
at concentrations ranging from 70 to 3030 μM significantly increased
the viability of the G. mellonella larvae
following with C. albicans infection.
Concentrations of BG10 of 70–3030 μM significantly increased
larval viability at 48 h (100 ± 0%, p > 0.01).
A concentration of 151 μM increased larval viability at 72 h
(76.66 ± 3.33%, p > 0.05), as compared to
the
relative DMSO control (33.33 ± 6.66%). BG10 was effective in
blocking C. albicans-induced larval
mortality at 48 h (100% ± 0%, p > 0.01) Figure 3b,d. The above outcomes
indicate that administration of BG8 and BG10 to the larvae produced
no adverse effects (e.g., melanisation) or death which is a good indication
that they may be nontoxic in mammals. Administration of compounds
to larvae infected with C. albicans resulted in increased survival, indicating in vivo activity. This
has been reported previously with novel antimicrobial compounds38,39 and a strong relationship among the in vivo activity of compounds
in larvae and rats has previously been demonstrated.40

2.3 In Silico Studies
The effect of these
compounds on ergosterol biosynthesis was further confirmed by in silico
studies in which both gemini surfactants were docked with an enzyme
lanosterol 14-α demethylase (CYP51) member of the cytochrome
P-450 super family that catalyzes the oxidative elimination of the
14-α alkyl group from lanosterol in the ergosterol biosynthesis
pathway. The inhibition of CYP51 directly depleted ergosterol followed
by the inhibition of yeast growth and acts as a primary target of
azoles as antifungal drugs. The CYP51 crystal structure from pathogenic
yeast C. albicans was recently published
by the group of Keniya et al. and submitted to RCSB protein data bank
(PDB ID: 5v5z).41 The interaction and binding energy
of inhibitors BG8 and BG10 with CYP51 were identified using molecular
docking (Figure 4),
and the docked results were compared with reference drug itraconazole.
Both gemini surfactants contain the benzimidazolium group flanked
by long alkyl hydrophobic side chains (C8H17 in BG8 and C10H21 in BG10). The docking studies
revealed that BG8 was bound close to the heme group in the active
site of CYP51 interacting with active site residues such as Phe-449,
Ile-471, Gln-142, Tyr-132, Leu-376, and forms a hydrogen bond with
His-468 with a binding affinity of −7.7 kcal mol–1. While as BG10 was bound to residues Tyr-447, Phe-105, Glu-115,
Arg-469, His-310, and a hydrogen bond with GLY-303 with a binding
affinity of −8.3 kcal mol–1 as compared to
itraconazole shows −9.6 kcal mol–1.34 Thus, the docking results support BG8, BG10
binding with the 14-α demethylase enzyme (CYP51) and inhibiting
ergosterol biosynthesis. The probable mechanism of action for gemini
benzimidazolium surfactants with the yeast membrane is shown in Scheme 1.

ligplot of (A) CYP51–BG8 and (B) CYP51–BG10
complexes.

2.4 Toxicity
2.4.1 Hemolytic Assay
The toxicity of
surfactants BG8 and BG10 on human red blood cells (hRBCs) were observed
to evaluate the hemolytic assay. At 1510 μM concentration, BG8
and BG10 showed reasonable toxicity triggering only 28 and 33% hemolysis,
respectively, as compared to the reference drug FLC with 78% hemolysis.
However, at 152 μM concentration, these surfactants show low
toxicity triggering only 13% (BG8) and 16% (BG10) cell lysis. At 38
μM concentration, BG8 and BG10 are totally harmless causing
only 4 and 8% cell lysis, respectively. Thus, these potent anti-candida geminis exhibited less toxicity than the reference
drug FLC at each tested concentration extending from 38 to 1510 μM
showing an extra protection index, as compared to reference drug FLC
(Figure 5a).

(a) and cell viability assay (b) of BG8 and BG10.

2.4.2 Cytotoxicity Assay
The selected
compounds were further evaluated for cytotoxicity by the (3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide) (MTT) assay on the noncancerous human cell line (HEK293),
which is a specific cell line initially resulting from the cells of
the human embryonic kidney grown by a tissue culture. HEK 293 cells
are widely used in cell biological research over decades, because
of their consistent growth and inclination for transfection.42−44 The selected compounds were screened in the concentration range
of 0–160 μM, and it was found that even at 160 μM,
compounds BG8 and BG10 do not disrupt the feasibility of HEK293 in
a significant manner. These results clearly advocated that the selected
compounds are noncytotoxic to HEK293 cells in the tested concentration
range. Further, these results speculate that these compounds might
be used as potential antifungal molecules, as in the tested sub-micromolar
concentration range, these exhibited a noncytotoxic nature towards
normal human cells (Figure 5b).30

3 Conclusions
Two benzimidazolium-based gemini surfactants
BG8 and BG10 have
been synthesized and were well characterized by FT-IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and mass spectroscopy. Moreover, their
physicochemical characterization was also done using a surface tension
method to evaluate various interfacial parameters viz: Γmax, pC20, Amin, and P (packing parameter). The anti-candida studies for these compounds along with reference
drug, FLC against three strains of Candida (C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. tropicalis) were performed
and the results suggested that gemini BG surfactants showed better anti-candida potential as compared to the reference drug.
BG8 and BG10 exhibit potent inhibitory activity against the resistant
strain with MIC values of 23.7 and 10.9 μM, respectively, indicating
that BG10 is more effective against the resistant C.
albicans strain compared with standard drug FLC. Administration
of these compounds to larvae infected with C. albicans resulted in increased survival indicating in vivo activity. The
consequence of these compounds on ergosterol biosynthesis in C. albicans was examined to determine affected cell
membrane biosynthesis and the results confirmed a decrease in dose-dependent
ergosterol content once the cells had been grown in variable concentrations
of test compounds. Our docking studies further confirmed the ergosterol
biosynthesis in C. albicans, revealing
that both BG8 and BG10 were bound close to the heme group in the active
site of CYP51 with high binding affinities. The MTT assay with noncancerous
human cell line (HEK293) results indicated that the selected compounds
are noncytotoxic to the HEK293 cells in the tested concentration range.

4.3 Physicochemical Characterization
The physicochemical characterization of two newly synthesized gemini
surfactants was done by using surface tensiometry (more details are
given in the Supporting Information). The
different interfacial parameters viz cmc, πcmc, pC20, Γmax, Amin, and P were evaluated by using different
equations and are given in Table 4.10,16,17 In addition, the cmc values were also confirmed by UV-visible and
pyrene probe fluorescence spectroscopy and given in the Supporting Information (Figure S9).

4.4 In Vitro Anti-candida Activity
Both
the surfactants, BG8 and BG10 were investigated for their in vitro anti-candida activity against C. albicans (ATCC 90028), C. glabrata (ATCC 90030), C. tropicalis (ATCC 750), and FLC resistant C. albicans D15.9 strains by using the broth dilution
procedure according to the quality protocol for antifungal assessment
by NCCLS (National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards).45 FLC (3.26 μM) was used as a positive control
for the anti-candida study. The surfactant solutions
were made in DMSO and diluted serially in a broth medium to attain
the desired concentration of DMSO less than 1%. Variable concentrations
of surfactants (1500–10.9 μM) were distributed into a
96 well plate in a Sabouraud dextrose (SD) broth medium in a 100 μL
final volume. Further, 100 μL of yeast cells (approximate 2.5
× 103 cells/mL using (McFarland standard)45 were distributed into the 96 well plate (Tarson)
with incubation at 37 °C for 24 h. During the incubated period
each well was investigated for the attendance or absence of visual
growth of yeast cells. The lowermost concentration of the tested compound
on which no observable growth occurs characterizes its MIC value.
Moreover, the growth was observed turbidometrically at 600 nm using
a ThermoMultiskan Go spectrophotometer after incubation.

4.5 Growth Curve Studies
The cells of C.
albicans were revived freshly by a subculture
on a SD agar plate. A loopful of inoculum was introduced into the
SD broth, finally the cells were grown for 16 h at 37 °C before
use. About 2 × 103 cells/mL were injected into the
freshly prepared 50 mL sterile SD medium. Various concentrations equal
to MIC, MIC/2, and 2MIC of the surfactants were separately added into
the conical flasks comprising of the inoculated medium, which was
incubated at 37 °C and 160 rpm. Strain specific concentration
of FLC was used as positive control of 102 μM for C. albicans ATCC90028 and 3260 μM C. albicans D15.9 (FLC resistant), respectively.
At prearranged time periods (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20,
22, and 24 after incubation with agitation at 37 °C), 1 mL aliquot
from each sample in a conical flask was removed and growth was observed
turbidometrically at 600 nm using a Thermo Multiskan spectrophotometer.
The optical densities were recorded against each concentration with
time (hour).

4.6 FIC Index/Synergistic Activity
The
fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index or synergistic activity
of BG8 and BG10 with FLC was determined against C.
albicans. Synergy and antagonism were defined by FIC
indices of <0.5 and >4, respectively. The FIC index result of
>
0.5, but < 4 was considered indifferent. Both surfactants BG8 and
BG10 were serially diluted in growth medium with concentration ranging
from 95 to 0.04 μM against C. albicans ATCC90028 and 62.5–0.03 μM of FLC, respectively. The
MIC values of compound alone and in combination with FLC were determined
by broth micro dilution method in 96 well plate. FIC index was calculated
by using the following eq 1(34) 1  

4.7 Ergosterol
Biosynthesis in C. albicans
The whole intracellular sterols
were estimated as reported earlier using standard C.
albicans ATCC 90028. Three distinct conical flasks
containing compounds BG8 and BG10 at MIC, MIC/2, and MIC/4 in the
SD broth injected with freshly cultured cells of C.
albicans ATCC 90028 were used. FLC (130 μM)
was taken as the positive control and untreated cells were taken as
the negative control for comparison and conical flasks were incubated
at 35 °C for 16 h. The cells were harvested at their stationary
phase after incubation and the weight of the pellet was determined.
The pellet was treated with KOH solution (25% alcoholic potassium
hydroxide) followed by incubation at 85 °C for 1 h. After incubation,
sterol was removed by the addition of n-heptane/distilled water (1:3
ratio). The layers of heptane were moved into the fresh test tubes
diluted five-fold in 100% ethanol and observed spectrophotometrically
in the range of 240–300 nm. The existence of ergosterol and
late-sterol intermediate DHE in the extracted samples shows a characteristic
four peak curve.46,47

4.8 Assessment
of Anti-candida Compound Toxicity and Efficacy in G. mellonella
Sixth instar larvae of the G. mellonella greater wax: moth (Live foods Direct
Ltd. Sheffield, England) were
kept in the dark at 15 °C to avoid pupation. Larvae which weigh
0.22 ± 0.03 g were selected and used within 2 weeks of receiving.
10 healthy larvae per treatment and controls (n =
3) were positioned in sterile 9 cm Petri dishes creased with Whatman
filter paper with some wood shavings. Larvae were adjusted to 30 °C
for 1 h prior to all experiments and incubated at 30 °C for all
studies. All experiments were done independently at three distinct
times. For toxicity studies, larvae were injected with 20 μL
of BG8 and BG10 (3030–76 μM) by last left pro-leg, and
reaction to stimuli was measured every 24 h. To assess the antifungal
efficacy of BG8 and BG10 a culture of Candida albicans were grown to the immobile phase (nearly 2 × 108/mL) in the YEPD broth (2% w/v glucose, 2% w/v bactopptone, 1% w/v
yeast extract) at 30 °C and 200 rpm. By centrifugation, (2056g for 5 min) the cells were harvested by using a GS-6 Beckmann
bench-centrifuge and washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) three
times and resuspended again in PBS at 5 × 105/20 μL.
The larvae were injected with yeast cells via the last left pro-leg
into the hemocoel with a Myjector U-100 insulin syringe (Terumo. Europe.
N.V., Belgium) and positioned at 30 °C in the dark. One hour
post injection, larvae were injected with compounds BG8 and BG10 at
varying concentrations resuspended in PBS added with 10% DMSO (v/v)
through the last right pro-leg. Infected larvae were injected with
20 μL PBS supplemented with 10% DMSO (v/v). To assess larval
viability, larvae which did not respond to touch stimulus were considered
dead.

4.9 Hemolytic Assay
The haemolytic activity
of the surfactants BG8 and BG10 and the conventional antifungal drug
FLC were determined on human red blood cells (hRBCs). Human erythrocytes
from healthy individuals were collected in tubes containing EDTA as
an anticoagulant. The erythrocytes were harvested by centrifugation
for 10 min at 2000 rpm and 20°C, and washed three times in phosphate
buffered saline (PBS). To the pellet, PBS was added to yield a 10%
(v/v) erythrocytes/PBS suspension. The 10% suspension of erythrocytes
was then further diluted with PBS at a 1:10 ratio. 100 μL of
the final diluted erythrocytes was added to 100 μL of PBS having
a previously determined concentration gradient (38 μM to 1.51
mM) of the test compounds in microcentrifuge tubes. Total hemolysis
was attained in 1% Triton X-100. The tubes were incubated for 1 h
at 37 °C and then centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 rpm at room
temperature. From the supernatant fluid, 150 μL was transferred
to a flat bottomed microtiter plate (Tarson), and the absorbance was
measured spectrophotometrically at 450 nm by using a Thermo Multiskan
spectrophotometer. The hemolysis percentage was calculated by following eq 2(37) 2  

4.10 Cytotoxicity by MTT Assay
HEK293
cell lines were procured from the National Centre for Cell Sciences
(NCCS) Pune, India. Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM), antibiotic cocktail, and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were procured
from Gibco Life Technologies. Thermo Fisher Scientific (USA). MTT
and trypsin-EDTA solution has been purchased from Sigma (St. Louis,
MO). HEK293 cells has been cultured and maintained in DMEM media enriched
with 10% heat inactivated FBS and 1% penicillin, streptomycin solution
at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cell
cultures have been routinely preserved and trypsinized not beyond
30 passages. HEK293 cells were broadcasted in triplicate in 96-well
plate containing a cell count of approximately 9000–10 000
cells/well and incubated in a CO2 incubator for 24 h. Then,
the cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of test compounds
(5–250 μM) in a final volume of 200 μL for 48 h
at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. The mixture of the culture
medium and compounds were removed after 48 h of incubation at 37 °C
and cells have been washed two times with a PBS (pH 7.4) solution.
After that, freshly prepared 20 μL MTT at a concentration of
48.27 mM in PBS and 100 μL of DMEM has been added to each well
and the plates were incubated for 4–5 h at 37 °C in the
CO2 incubator. DMSO (150 μL/well) was added to solubilize
the formazan crystals, the metabolized MTT product, and was allowed
a short incubation of 10 min at 27 °C. The absorbance was noted
at 570 nm on the multi-plate ELISA reader (Bio-Rad, USA). % viability
was taken as the comparative absorbance of treated versus untreated
control cells and plotted as a function of concentration of compounds.
All the results were obtained in triplicate.

4.11 Statistical
Analysis
The data were
evaluated as one-way analysis of variance (AVOVA) to detect the mean
values observed for control and after treatment with compounds. Dunnett’s
test was used to compare the treatment, control and statistical significance
was set at P ≤ 0.01.
