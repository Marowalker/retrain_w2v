Epilepsy is a common cause of serious cognitive disorders and is
known to have impact on patients’ memory and executive functions.
Therefore, the development of antiepileptic drugs for the improvement
of spatial learning and memory in patients with epileptic cognitive
dysfunction is important. In the present work, we systematically predicted
and analyzed the potential effects of Ginkgo terpene trilactones (GTTL)
on cognition and pathologic changes utilizing in silico and in vivo
approaches. Based on our established chemogenomics knowledgebase,
we first conducted the network systems pharmacology analysis to predict
that ginkgolide A/B/C may target 5-HT 1A, 5-HT 1B, and 5-HT 2B. The
detailed interactions were then further validated by molecular docking
and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In addition, status epilepticus
(SE) was induced by lithium–pilocarpine injection in adult
Wistar male rats, and the results of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) demonstrated that administration with GTTL can increase the
expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) when compared
to the model group. Interestingly, recent studies suggest that the
occurrence of a reciprocal involvement of 5-HT receptor activation
along with the hippocampal BDNF-increased expression can significantly
ameliorate neurologic changes and reverse behavioral deficits in status
epilepticus rats while improving cognitive function and alleviating
neuronal injury. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of GTTL (bilobalide,
ginkgolide A, ginkgolide B, and ginkgolide C) on synergistic antiepileptic
effect. Our experimental data showed that the spatial learning and
memory abilities (e.g., electroencephalography analysis and Morris
water maze test for behavioral assessment) of rats administrated with
GTTL were significantly improved under the middle dose (80 mg/kg,
GTTL) and high dose (160 mg/kg, GTTL). Moreover, the number of neurons
in the hippocampus of the GTTL group increased when compared to the
model group. Our studies showed that GTTL not only protected rat cerebral
hippocampal neurons against epilepsy but also improved the learning
and memory ability. Therefore, GTTL may be a potential drug candidate
for the prevention and/or treatment of epilepsy.

1 Introduction
Epilepsy, one of the most common central nervous system (CNS) disorders,
can cause disturbances in the brain and often lead to seizures. It
is a complex disorder with an unclear defined pathogenesis process.
These disturbance episodes occur frequently with complex symptoms.
Learning and memory dysfunction is the most common neuropsychological
effects of epilepsy.

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF),
an important molecular
mediator of the neuroplasticity in the brain, can influence many different
brain functions (e.g., learning and memory).1,2 It
is known that the BDNF concentration decreases during an epilepsy
episode, which can be a factor underlying the epilepsy process. Currently,
there are no effective treatments available to improve the prognosis
of patients with epilepsy, despite having adequate trials for potentially
effective antiepileptic agents. Several clinical observations3,4 suggest that epilepsy can lead to progressive cognitive impairment.
Main physiopathological symptoms observed in epileptic patients include
neuronal losses, reactive gliosis, mossy fiber sprouting, dendritic
injury, and neurogenesis.5 A considerable
amount of evidence from both rodent and human studies indicate that
the status of epileptics epileptiform abnormalities can contribute
to cognitive impairment.

Patients with epilepsy usually require
long-term treatment with
antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and those with refractory epilepsy often
require polytherapy. However, most AEDs are far from ideal and they
often possess undesirable side effects while lacking the ability to
manage these conditions in the long term. For example, carbamazepine
hypersensitivity and valproate teratogenicity are some well-known
limitations of AEDs. There are no available Food and Drug Administration
(FDA)-approved drugs that have disease-modifying or preventive properties.
Therefore, there is a clear need for the development of a more effective
agent for the treatment or modification of the progression of epilepsy
and epilepsy-related cognitive impairment. A solution to such a problem
is to seek out a novel antiepileptic from the plant kingdom that could
potentially offer a solution to mild cognitive impairment, without
adverse effects associated with AEDs, such as hypersensitivity reactions
or aplastic anemia.6

Ginkgo biloba L., also known as
the “living fossil”, belongs to the family of Ginkgoaceae
and has been introduced to other tepid climates in both hemispheres.7 Leaf extract of G. biloba L. (GBE) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) used to treat both
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and Alzheimer’s
disease.8−10 Similarly, in European medicine, GBE has been employed
for the improvement of memory, neuronal disorders (e.g., tinnitus
or intermittent claudication), amelioration of brain metabolism, and
peripheral blood flow.11 In addition, several
studies using experimental animal models have been performed to further
explore its additional therapeutic potential, especially in neurodegenerative
and behavioral dysfunctions.12

Wide
neuroprotective effects of GBE are determined by the following
active substances: “terpene trilactones, flavonol glycosides,
biflavones, proanthocyanidins, alkylphenols, simple phenolic acids,
6-hydroxykynurenic acid, 4-O-methylpyridoxine, polyprenols, and so
on.”13 Currently, there is a large
gap between the understanding of the GBE ingredients and their therapeutic
effect in the damage of nerves. Recent research has demonstrated the
repair of the function in learning and memory formation in subjects
treated with Ginkgo flavonoids. However, studies on Ginkgo terpene
trilactones (GTTLs) are limited. Ginkgolides are the only natural
products that possess a tert-butyl group with many
potential therapeutics.13,14 For example, a recent
study15 shows that YY-1224, a GTTL strengthened G. biloba extraction, can ameliorate the Alzheimer’s
disease pathogenesis by its inhibitory effect on oxidative stress
and neuroinflammation. Lu et al.16 also
demonstrated that GTTL has antithrombotic effects in vivo. In addition,
Choi and co-workers17 evaluated the effects
of the gut microbiota on the pharmacokinetics of the active form of
GTTL. For safety/toxicity, Chan18 reported
that ginkgolides A and B induced apoptosis and decreased cell numbers
in mouse blastocysts, leading to embryonic death. In addition, Shiao
et al.19 reported that ginkgolide B may
cause negative impacts on the mouse oocytes fertilization, maturation,
and fetal development both in vitro and in vivo.

In this study,
we first carried out computational systems pharmacology
(CSP)-target mapping for the active ingredients of GTTL. Next, docking
studies and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to explore
the interaction pattern between the active ingredients of GTTL and
the predicted targets (5-HT 1A, 5-HT 1B, and 5-HT 2B). Combining with
the result of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that GTTL
can increase the expression level of BDNF, we hypothesized that GTTL
may have a positive effect on epilepsy prevention and treatment. Finally,
we experimentally evaluated the active constituents of GTTL, including
bilobalide and ginkgolide A/B/C on their ability to improve learning
and memory, using lithium–pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus
rats as a validation of our prediction.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Systems Pharmacology Analysis
Using Our Knowledgebases
and Tools
We extracted trilactone mixture from ginkgo leaves,
including ginkgolide A, ginkgolide B, ginkgolide C, and bilobalide
(Figure 1). The ratio
of these four mentioned ingredients in the mixture is 4:1:2:3 based
on the result of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Taking
the low dose 40 mg/kg as an example, GTTL contains 16 mg/kg ginkgolide
A, 4 mg/kg ginkgolide B, 8 mg/kg ginkgolide C, and 12 mg/kg bilobalide.

Figure 1 Systems
pharmacology analyses for GTTL. A map of GTTLs and their
suspected targets with docking scores higher than 5.0 were constructed
based on the binding simulations using our established knowledgebases
and tools.

First, we performed target/off-target
prediction for these four
major ingredients of GTTL, using our Alzheimer Database (AlzPlatform),
Hallucinogen-Specific Chemogenomics Database, and drug abuse-related
GPCRs knowledgebase. The reason we choose these databases is that
these databases contain CNS-related target proteins. As shown in Figure 1, a map of GTTLs
and their suspected targets were constructed based on the binding
simulations with docking scores higher than 5.0.

As illustrated
in Figure 1, the potential
targets of GTTL include monoamine oxidase
A (MAO A), monoamine oxidase B (MAO B), 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor
1A (5-HT 1A), 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1B (5-HT 1B), 5-hydroxytryptamine
receptor 2B (5-HT 2B), cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP450 2D6), sucrase–isomaltase
(SI), and Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (RAC1). Interestingly,
MAO A and MAO B belong to the monoamine oxidase family that oxidizes
various amine substrates, such as small-molecule monoamines, polyamines,
and modified amino acids within proteins.20 MAO A is known for its ability to regulate the levels of monoamine
neurotransmitters including serotonin, noradrenaline, and dopamine,21 while MAO B catalyzes the oxidation of arylalkylamine
neurotransmitters, mostly dopamine.22 5-HT
1A, 5-HT 1B, and 5-HT 2B all belong to the serotonin receptor family,
which are involved with many accentual neurological processes, including
mood regulation, sleep, learning, memory, and aggression.23 Cytochrome P450 2D6 is an isoform of cytochrome
P450 present in the human brain, which is involved with the metabolism
of various neurotransmitters and neurosteroids.24 SI (sucrase–isomaltase) is an intestinal glycoprotein
utilized for the breakdown of glycogen and starch.25 RAC1 is a Rho GTPase, which is an important modulator in
the cytoskeleton, and it is critical for numerous cellular functions
such as phagocytosis, neuronal polarization, and adhesion.26

First, our results showed that ginkgolide
C may be able to bind
to MAO A (docking score: 5.29) or MAO B (docking score: 7.35), in
turn indicating that ginkgolide C may potentially regulate the levels
of monoamine neurotransmitters including serotonin, dopamine, and
noradrenaline. Moreover, four active gradients of GTTL were predicted
to bind to CYP2D6, meaning they may be metabolized by CYP2D6. Additionally,
ginkgolides A, B, and C were predicted to bind to both 5-HT 2B and
5-HT 1A, but not bilobalide. The docking scores of 5-HT 1A were observed
to be especially high for these three chemicals, including 6.14 for
ginkgolide A, 6.09 for ginkgolide B, and 6.64 for ginkgolide C. The
role of serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission in the epileptogenesis
has already been confirmed by several previous studies. Thus, our
predicted results suggested the possible role of GTTL in the potential
treatment of epilepsy. To further explore the docking interactions
between 5-HT 1A/2B and ginkgolide A/B/C, we carried out molecular
docking studies. The results are shown below.

2.2 Detailed
Interactions between GTTL and 5-HT
Figure 2 shows that
the binding pockets of 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 2B shared seven identical
residues, such as Asp116/Asp1353.32, Val117/Val1363.33, Ala203/Ala2255.461, Trp358/Trp3376.48, Phe361/Phe3406.51, Phe362/Phe3416.52, and
Tyr390/Tyr3707.42, while some different residues located
in the binding site, such as Cys120/Ser1393.36, Tyr195/Phe2175.39, Thr196/Met2185.40, Ser199/Gly2215.43, Ala365/Asn3446.55, Ala383/Glu3637.35, and
Asn386/Val3667.38, might influence the binding mode and
affinity.

Figure 2 Detailed interaction between GTTL and 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 2B. (a–c)
Docking interactions between 5-HT 1A and ginkgolide A/B/C. (d–f)
Docking interactions between 5-HT 2B and ginkgolide A/B/C.

For 5-HT 1A, methyl-substituted lactone of the agonist inserts
into the binding pocket and forms three strong hydrogen bonds between
the carbonyl of lactone and hydroxyl of Tyr390 (∼3.4–3.6
Å) and carboxyl of Asp116 (∼2.7–2.9 Å), which
stabilize their binding (Figure 2a–c). Meanwhile, the hydrogen bond (∼2.1–2.3
Å) between the amino of Asn386 and the oxygen on lactone further
stabilizes their binding. In addition, the hydroxyl on the five-membered
ring can form a hydrogen bond (3.4–3.6 Å) with the amide
of Asn386 (Figure 2a–c).

Ginkgolide A/ B/C were docked back into the binding
site of 5-HT
2B with a flipped pose owing to the different/selective residues between
5-HT 1A and 5-HT 2B (Ala383/Glu3637.35 and Asn386/Val3667.38). Two potential hydrogen bonds are observed between the
carbonyl of lactone and carboxyl of Glu363, with the distance of ∼3.5–3.9
and ∼3.4–3.8 Å, respectively; however, the hydrogen
bonds observed in ginkgolide B are weaker (3.9 and 3.8 Å) than
ginkgolide A/C (Figure 2d–f). Four hydrogen bonds were recorded between the two hydroxyls
on the five-membered ring of ginkgolide A/C and the hydroxyl of Tyr370
as well as the carboxyl of Asp135. The distance of these hydrogen
bonds ranged from 2.9 to 3.8 Å (Figure 2d,f); the short length of these bonds has
the potential to promote the binding of the ginkgolides and 5-HT 2B.
The carbonyl on the lactone of ginkgolide B can only form one hydrogen
bond with the hydroxyl of Tyr370 and one with the carboxyl of Asp135;
the distance is 2.6 Å (Figure 2e). Our results indicated that ginkgolide A/B/C may
bind to 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 2B and form a stable complex with strong
hydrogen bonds.

2.3 Molecular Dynamics (MD)
Simulation between
5-HT 1A and Ginkgolide A/C
To further explore the dynamic
interactions, we performed a 100 ns MD for the complexes of 5-HT 1A
and ginkgolide A/C. As shown in Figure 3a, the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 5-HT 1A
and ginkgolide A fluctuated around 1.8 and 0.6 Å, respectively,
indicating that the system was very stable during the simulation.
Moreover, RMSDs of 5-HT 1A and ginkgolide C were about 2.1 and 0.9
Å, respectively, which means this system stays at equilibrium,
as shown in Figure 3b. Sequentially, we selected 500 snapshots from 50 to 100 ns to calculate
the mean binding energy, as shown in Figure 3c,d. Importantly, we found that most of the
residues involved in the binding site of 5-HT 1A shared a similar
energy contribution to the recognition of ginkgolide A/C. For example,
Asp116 in TM3 of 5-HT 1A contributed greatly to the binding of ginkgolide
A/C with a strong hydrogen bond. Moreover, Thr118/Gly382/Asn386 interacted
with ginkgolide A/C with additional hydrogen bonds. Finally, several
hydrophobic residues involving Phe112, Ile113, Ile189, Phe361, and
Leu368 also contributed to the recognition of ginkgolide A/C (Tables 1 and 2). All of the above results were consistent with our previous docking studies.

2.4 Measurement of BDNF Concentration
Status
epilepticus (SE) was induced by lithium–pilocarpine
injection in adult male Wistar rats. After successfully developing
epilepsy (with behavioral seizure scores of 4 and 5), we looked into
the level of BDNF with/without GTTL, in which the expression of BDNF
in the brain increases as a mechanism to promote the repair of damaged
neurons.

As shown in Figure 4, the BDNF data had been collected for all six subject
groups from their hippocampus tissues. Even though the veh/pilo model
group was not being treated with any pharmacological agents, it still
expressed a significantly higher amount of BDNF compared to the control
group (veh/veh) (p < 0.01), which is consistent
with the literature regarding the elevation of BDNF upon neurological
damage. Animals in the positive control group (carbamazepine/pilo),
which is treated with 108 mg/kg carbamazepine, showed no significant
difference when compared to the model group. This finding could indicate
that carbamazepine exerts its neurological repair effect through a
mechanism that does not increase the expression of BDNF. The group
treated with low-dose GTTL (GTTL 40 mg/kg/pilo) also showed no significant
increase in BDNF when compared to the model group, which indicated
that there was no significant therapeutic benefit compared to the
model group. However, groups treated with middle-dose GTTL (GTTL 80
mg/kg/pilo) and high-dose GTTL (GTTL 160 mg/kg/pilo) showed a significant
increase in the level of BDNF when compared to the model group (veh/pilo)
(p < 0.01), which could indicate the effective
treatment through the introduced agent.

Figure 4 Expression of BDNF in
the hippocampus after treatments. As shown,
the expression of BDNF is significantly higher in the model group
(veh/pilo) compared to that of the control group (veh/veh). The expression
of BDNF in the positive control group (carbamazepine/pilo) and low-dose
GTTL treatment group (GTTL 40 mg/kg/pilo) showed no significant difference
compared to that of the model group. The expression of BDNF in the
middle-dose (GTTL 80 mg/kg/pilo) and high-dose (GTTL 160 mg/kg/pilo)
GTTL treatment group is significantly higher than that of the model
group. Symbols * or # indicates p < 0.05, ** or
## indicates p < 0.01, and *** or ### indicates p < 0.001.

Recently, some studies
suggest that the occurrence of a reciprocal
involvement of 5-HT receptor activation along with the hippocampal
BDNF-increased expression can significantly ameliorate neurologic
changes and reverse behavioral deficits in status epilepticus rats
while improving cognitive function and alleviate neuronal injury.
Therefore, we hypothesized that GTTL may have a positive effect on
epilepsy prevention and treatment.

2.5 Electroencephalography
Analysis
We
then carried out animal studies to experimentally investigate our
hypothesis. First, the electroencephalogram activity of rats was monitored.
As shown in Figure 5, the electroencephalogram of rats in the control group (veh/veh, Figure 5) mainly consists
of α or β waves with a small number of θ waves,
without obvious rhythm. However, the model group (veh/pilo, Figure 5) showed diffuse
epileptiform waves, mostly polyspike waves, synchronized sharp waves,
and slow spine composite waves, with a large number of epileptiform
discharges. The carbamazepine treatment group significantly decreased
the number of spike waves and sharp waves. High dose (160 mg/kg, GTTL),
middle dose (80 mg/kg, GTTL), and low dose (40 mg/kg, GTTL) treatment
groups showed scattered spike waves and sharp waves. The number of
spike waves and sharp waves decrease as the dose of GTTL increases,
which can indicate a collation between GTTL and the recovery of neurological
damage.

days of treatment.

2.6 Morris
Water Maze (MWM)
The spatial
learning and memory ability of each rat was tested using MWM (5 consecutive
days). Hallmarks include escape latency (Figure 6a), and swim pattern (Figure 7) were recorded and evaluated by a video
tracking system for the performance analysis. After completion of
the escape latency test, the platform was removed from the pool and
replaced with a visible platform. The probe trial was then applied
for all of the rats. Sequentially, the rats were placed in the pool
at the same pole and allowed to swim for 2 min. The number of rats
crossing the target quadrant was recorded, as shown in Figure 6b.

total number of subjects crossing the targeted
quadrant during the training trial in the Morris water maze (MWM).

day 1 to day 5. (b) Total number of subjects crossing the targeted
quadrant with the platform on day 6 of the Morris water maze experiment.
On day 6, rats were tested for a probe trial in which the platform
was removed from the pool and replaced by a visible platform. Rats
were placed in the pool at the same pole and allowed to swim for 2
min. Symbol * or # indicates p < 0.05, ** or ##
indicates p < 0.01, *** or ### indicates p < 0.001.

Figure 7 Travel pattern of search
strategy during the probe trial in MWM.
An illustration of the movement of the test subjects during the Morris
water maze before the subject reached the platform of the experiment.

First, the time to locate the escape latency (hidden
platform)
is shown in Figure 6a. The data demonstrated that on average, the control group animals
rapidly learned to find the hidden platform, whereas the animals treated
with Li-pilocarpine alone took the longest to reach the platform.
Furthermore, the escape time (Figure 6a) decreased in all groups daily, which showed that
the animals had learned to find the platform position. On the 3rd,
4th, and 5th day, the average latency to find the platform of rats
administrated with GTTL was significantly reduced in a time-dependent
and dose-dependent manner compared to the Li-pilocarpine group. On
the other hand, the escape latency of the Li-pilocarpine group on
the 3rd, 4th, and 5th day was significantly longer than that of the
controls (p < 0.01).

During the probe trial session, as shown in Figure 7, rats from the control group (veh/veh),
middle-dose group (80 mg/kg, GTTL), high-dose group (160 mg/kg, GTTL),
and carbamazepine group found the platform mainly in a linear manner,
while rats in the Li-pilocarpine group (veh/pilo) and low-dose group
(40 mg/kg, GTTL) searched for the platform primarily in the margin
with a random pattern. All in all, the experimental result showed
that the treatment of GTTL can improve the escape latency in lithium–pilocarpine-induced
status epilepticus rats, which could potentially indicate the improvement
of learning and memory abilities.

2.7 Nissl
Staining
The Nissl stain has
proven to be a reliable marker for neuronal degeneration in the hippocampal
CA3. Representative images of Nissl-stained hippocampal slices are
presented in Figure 8. Intact cells can be found in the veh/veh group, and we observed
a significant decrease of neuronal cells in the hippocampal slices
in Li-pilocarpine group rats compared to that of the control. Based
on the results, status epilepticus significantly increased necrotic
death in the hippocampal CA3 region of the rats in the veh/pilo group,
as compared with the rats in the control group (Figure 8a,b). However, with the GTTL treatment, neuronal
damage was significantly reduced in the high-dose group, which suggested
that GTTL could significantly decrease the neuronal loss in lithium–pilocarpine-induced
status epilepticus rats (Figure 8e–g).

rats after status
epilepticus. The stained area indicates the presence of neuronal cells.
An increase in the density of neuronal cells can indicate the recovery
of the brain from neurological damage. Red arrows indicate the histologic
changes (×400).

3 Conclusions
In the present work, we focus on the studies of Ginkgo terpene
trilactones (GTTL) and evaluate the effect of its extract (or crude
drug) containing different constituents (or compounds) on spatial
learning and memory. For the first time, our systems pharmacology
analysis and molecular docking studies indicated that the GTTL may
bind to 5-HT 1A/5-HT 1B/5-HT 2B, which may ameliorate neurologic changes.
Moreover, our results also showed that GTTL increased the level of
BDNF in the hippocampus of status epilepticus rats. Our experimental
observations showed that GTTL not only protected rat cerebral hippocampal
neurons against epilepsy but also improved the learning and memory
ability and alleviated neuronal injury. Therefore, GTTL may be a potential
lead candidate for epilepsy prevention or treatment. In addition,
we are investigating the effects and functions of each constituent
of GTTL, and the results will be published in the future.

and the potential target proteins.

Moreover, several in-house
chemoinformatics tools including TargetHunter, HTDocking, and Blood–Brain
Barrier (BBB) Predictor30,31 were also integrated
into the knowledgebases. In this work, we applied our Alzheimer Database
(AlzPlatform), Hallucinogen-related knowledgebase, DAKB-GPCRs (https://www.cbligand.org/dakb-gpcrs/),29 and our reported computational tools
to carry out the CSP-target mapping for GTTL, and the detailed protocol
can be found in our recent publications.32,33 Especially, Cytoscape 3.4.0,34 a tool
for analyzation and visualization, was used in the present work as
described previously.32,33

4.2 Docking
Study of Ligand Receptor
In this study, the homology model
of 5-HT 1A was built by using the
crystal structures 5-HT 1B (PDB:4IAQ/4IAR)35 and 5-HT 2B (PDB:4IB4).36

SYBYL-X 1.3 was used to predict the binding pocket(s)
of 5-HT 1A. Then, the docking program Surflex-Dock GeomX was used
to build the complex of 5-HT 1A-small molecules, in which the calculated
score is expressed as −log (Kd).37,38 The detailed protocol and the parameters of docking can be found
in our recent publications.37,38

4.3 Molecular
Dynamics (MD) Simulation
The complexes of 5-HT 1A receptor-bound
ginkgolide A/C were set up
for MD simulation, in which the system included 0.15 M NaCl, ∼21 000
water molecules, lipids, and ions with a box size of 93 Å ×
93 Å × 93 Å. In brief, protein, water molecules, and
ligands were described by AMBER ff14SB force field,39 TIP3P water model,40 and (AM1-BCC)
method41,42/GAFF in AMBER16.42

The simulations were conducted using the AMBER1643−45 package. The MD systems were first relaxed by a set of minimizations
by removing the possible steric clashes. Two femtoseconds were set
to the time step that was used for three different phases, including
the heating phase, equilibrium phase, and the entire production phase.
Especially, the temperature was constrained by Langevin dynamics with
2 ps–1 for collision frequency.46,47 Moreover, the long-range electrostatics was regulated by the reported
Particle Mesh Ewald48,49 method, and 10 Å was set
to the cutoff value of the real-space interactions. In addition, SHAKE
algorithm50 was applied to constrain each
hydrogen atom that is involved in covalent bonding. Finally, a 100
ns MD simulation was carried out for each system.

4.4 MM-GBSA Calculation
Snapshots (500)
were evenly selected from the sampling phase for MM-GBSA51−57 binding energy decomposition analysis, using the following formula  where EMM is the
total energies of molecular mechanics in vacuo, including internal
energies, electrostatic, and van der Waals. ΔESOL is the sum of ΔEGB (polar solvation energy) and ΔESA (nonpolar energy), in which the former energy term was calculated
by the GB approximation model56,58 and the latter was
computed by fitting SASA59 with the LCPO
model.60,61 The MM-GBSA analysis can be used to investigate
the contribution of each binding residue.62

4.5 Animals
Adult male Wistar rats, weighing
240–260 g, were purchased from the Zhejiang Academy of Medical
Sciences Laboratory Animal Center (Hangzhou, China), license number:
SCXK-20140003. All animals were housed and kept on a 12 h/12 h light/dark
cycle in standard conditions with temperature and relative humidity
set at 23 ± 2 °C and 55 ± 10%, respectively. All animals
had free access to diet and water. Animal sacrifice at the end of
the study was performed under deep anesthesia with 5% isoflurane.
All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals in the Zhejiang University
of Technology, Hangzhou, China, and conformed to the National Institutes
of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Publication
No. 85-23, revised 1996).

4.6 Materials
G. biloba L. terpene trilactones (GTTLs) used in
this study were obtained
from the Zhejiang Conba Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., China. The mixture
included bilobalide, ginkgolide A, ginkgolide B, and ginkgolide C
(Figure 9a). The representative
chromatograms of the standard mixture and sample of GTTL are shown
in Figure 9b,c. The
chromatographic peaks were identified by comparing their retention
times with reference compounds and spiking of samples with the reference
compounds. The ratio of four ingredients in the mixture is 4:1:2:3
for ginkgolide A, ginkgolide B, ginkgolide C, and bilobalide, respectively,
from the result of HPLC.

4.7 Induction of Status Epilepticus Rats and GTTL
Treatment
Status epilepticus (SE) was induced by lithium–pilocarpine
injection as reported previously but with some modifications.63 Male Wistar rats were intraperitoneally injected
with 127 mg/kg freshly prepared lithium chloride (Sigma). After 18–20
h, atropine (1 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally administered 30 min prior
to the intraperitoneal injection of pilocarpine hydrochloride (20
mg/kg) (Sigma). If no seizure was determined after 30 min, the animals
were continuously injected with 10 mg/kg pilocarpine every 30 min
until stage 4 or 5 seizure was presented. Behavioral seizures were
scored according to the Racine scale64 with
minor modifications as follows: without any detectable response (stage
0); mouth and face twitching (stage 1); mouth and face twitching and
head nodding (stage 2); mouth and face twitching, head nodding, and
forelimb twitching (stage 3); mouth and face twitching, head nodding,
forelimb twitching, and rearing (stage 4); mouth and face twitching,
head nodding, forelimb twitching, rearing and loss of balance (stage
5). The status epilepticus (SE) could last for up to 60 min before
being interrupted via administration of 10% chloral hydrate (Sigma)
(300 mg/kg), which terminates the attack. The behavior changes of
animals in both control and model groups were carefully examined each
day after injection. Then, all animals were monitored by video to
assure the development of spontaneous epileptic activities, and they
got into the chronic epileptic phase after 10 days. The control rats
received an injection of the same amount of normal saline as a replacement
for pilocarpine (veh/veh 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide in saline, n = 10). The rats that successfully developed spontaneous
epileptic were divided into the following experimental groups for
a period of 4 weeks: group I (veh/pilo, n = 10) was
treated with vehicle; group II (GTTL 40/pilo, n =
10), group III (GTTL 80/pilo, n = 10), and group
IV (GTTL 160/pilo, n = 10) were treated with GTTL
at 40, 80, and 160 mg/kg, p.o., respectively; group V (carbamazepine/pilo, n = 10) was treated with 108 mg/kg carbamazepine. (Li-pilocarpine
treatment with administrated orally and carbamazepine daily.)

4.8 Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent
Assay (ELISA)
for the Determination of BDNF Level
The BDNF levels in hippocampal
homogenates were determined by ELISA assay. Briefly, 96-well plates
were coated for 24 h with the sample diluents. The standard curve
ranged from 7.8 to 500 pg/mL of BDNF. Then, the plates were washed
four times with the sample diluents. After washing, a monoclonal anti-BNDF
rabbit antibody was sequentially added to each well, followed by an
incubation of 2 h at room temperature. After being completely washed,
another antibody of peroxidase-conjugated antirabbit (1:200) was added
to the plates for 1 h incubation. Finally, after adding the substrate,
stop solution, and streptavidin enzyme, the levels of BDNF were determined
by measuring the absorbance at 450 nm using a plate reader. Data were
expressed as pg BDNF/mg total protein calculated against the standard
curve.

4.9 Electroencephalography Analysis
At
the end of the experimental period, the electroencephalogram activity
of rats from the above groups was monitored through a POWERLAB System
(AD Instruments, Australia) for at least 2 h. Briefly, under 5% isoflurane
anesthesia, the rat was placed on a stereotaxic frame, and recording
electrodes were implanted over the hippocampus. From these electrode
placements, electroencephalography signals were taken.

4.10 Morris Water Maze
After 4 weeks,
the cognitive impairments in spatial learning and memory formation
of all of the rats were investigated by Morris water maze (MWM) test.65 The MWM was a circular pool with 180 cm in diameter
and 60 cm in height that filled to a depth of 35 cm with water (23–26.8
°C) and was divided into four quadrants. Animals were trained
to seek an escape platform (25 cm2 Plexiglas square, 2
cm below the surface of the water in one of four quadrants) placed
in the center of a fixed quadrant (goal quadrant) onto which rats
could escape from the water. Rats were submitted to a training of
5 consecutive days in the MWM, and then they were put in randomly
chosen quadrants of the pool to escape onto the goal platform. On
locating the platform, the rats could remain there for 30 s before
returning to its cage. If the rat failed to find the platform in 2
min, the time was assigned as 2 min. The rat was then manually guided
to the platform where it stayed on for 30 s. Hallmarks that included
escape latency and swim patterns were recorded and evaluated utilizing
a video tracking system for the performance analysis. After completion
of the escape latency test, the platform was removed from the pool
and replaced with a visible platform. Then, the probe trial was applied
for all of the rats. Sequentially, rats were placed in the pool at
the same pole and allowed to swim for 2 min. The number of rats crossing
the target quadrant was recorded.

4.11 Nissl
Staining
Rats from the above
groups were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane. Sequentially, they were
perfused through the heart with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The brains
were isolated immediately and fixed in 4% PFA for 24 h, followed by
submerging in 20 and 30% sucrose for 48 h.66 Then, the hippocampus of the brain was cut into 25-μm-thick
sections by a freezing microtome (ThermoFisher), and the sections
were then stained using Nissl staining solution (Beyotime Institute
of Biotechnology, Nantong, China) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. At the end of staining, the neuronal survival and loss
of Nissl bodies in the hippocampus were observed using a light microscope
(Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).

4.12 Statistical Analysis
All data are
demonstrated as mean ± SD and analyzed using SPSS 13.0 software.
The significance of differences analyses between different groups
was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Group differences
were calculated using t-test, and * or # indicates p < 0.05, ** or ## indicates p <
0.01, and *** or ### indicates p < 0.001.
