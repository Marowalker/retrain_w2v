In
this work, we prepared different initiator solutions containing
ether and AlCl3 by changing the addition sequence of ingredients,
studied the interactions between ether and AlCl3 from the
evolution of the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra by comparison,
and investigated the catalytic performances of AlCl3 affected
by ether for isobutylene polymerization. We observed that different
preparation methods of initiator solutions could lead to two kinds
of interactions between ether and H2O/AlCl3 in
hexane. The strong interaction could stabilize carbenium ions and
seriously decrease the catalytic performance, whereas the weak interaction
could promote isomerization and proton elimination. Moreover, we found
that the preparation method of initiator solutions was not a critical
factor in CH2Cl2. Finally, a universal mechanism
based on the AlCl3-involved interactions in different solvents
was proposed to understand the effects of ether on the cationic polymerization
catalyzed by AlCl3 thoroughly.

Introduction
Polyisobutylenes (PIBs), produced by the
cationic polymerization
of isobutylene (IB),1−3 have drawn attention from both industry and academia
in recent years because of their distinguished properties with respect
to thermal stability, flexibility at ambient temperature, impermeability
to gases, and so forth.4−7 These excellent properties lead to their wide applications in auto
tyres, medical bottle plugs, sealants, ashless dispersants, gasoline
additives, and so forth.8−10 Different applications of PIBs
need different molecular weights (Mn).
According to Mn, commercially available
PIBs can be classified into three categories: (i) high-molecular-weight
PIBs (Mn > 100 000 g mol–1); (ii) medium molecular-weight PIBs (MPIBs, Mn = 10 000–100 000 g mol–1), and (iii) low-molecular-weight PIBs (LPIBs, Mn < 5000 g mol–1).11−13 Recently, many
attentions have been paid on the LPIBs with a high content of exo-olefin end groups and narrow molecular weight distribution,
denoted as highly reactive PIBs (HRPIBs), because of their high activity
in synthesizing lubricants and gasoline additives.14−19

The initiator solution of H2O/aluminum chloride
(AlCl3) is widely adopted for IB polymerization because
of the low
cost and high efficiency,20−23 in which H2O and AlCl3 work
as the initiator and the coinitiator, respectively. However, the polymerization
initiated by H2O/AlCl3 involves complicated
chain reactions, such as isomerization, chain termination, and so
forth. To control the chain reactions, nucleophilic reagents such
as ether or ester are usually added in the initiator solution. The
basicity and steric hindrance of the nucleophilic reagent as well
as the stability of the corresponding complex have great influence
on polymerization.24,25

Through the regulation
of nucleophilic reagents, many functional
polymers with different molecular weights were attained, such as the
HRPIBs, MPIBs with high content of exo-olefin, and
so forth.26−33 The availability of various polymers indicates the complicated effects
of nucleophilic reagents on polymerization. Although researchers always
gave some explanations on specific experimental results, the interactions
of initiators, coinitiator and nucleophilic reagents, are still lack
of systematic understanding.34−40 In this work, we prepared different initiator solutions containing
ether and AlCl3 by changing the addition sequence of ingredients,
studied the interactions between ether and AlCl3 from the
evolution of the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of ether
by comparison, investigated the catalytic performance of AlCl3 affected by ether on IB polymerization according to conversion
determination and product characterization, and proposed a universal
mechanism to clarify the effects of ethers on the cationic polymerization
catalyzed by AlCl3. Herein, both normal ether [diethyl
ether (Et2O), pKa = −3.59]
and branched ether [isopropyl ether (iPr2O), pKa = −4.30] were used to study the influence of
basicity and steric hindrance; both the nonpolar solvent (n-hexane) and the polar solvent [dichloromethane (CH2Cl2)] were used to introduce the influence of solvent
environment; the microflow reactor was exploited as a suitable platform
for investigating instantaneous processes including cationic polymerization.41−43 Through the research, the effects of ether on the cationic polymerization
catalyzed by AlCl3 in different solvents are understood
thoroughly to provide a rational and effective access to customized
functional polymers.

Results and Discussion
For the cationic
polymerization of IB, solvents have great influence
on the chain reactions because the polarity of solvents could affect
the reactivity of active centers distinctly. Herein, we investigated
the polymerization processes in a nonpolar solvent (n-hexane) and a polar solvent (CH2Cl2) separately.

Cationic
Polymerization of IB in Hexane
Effects of Et2O
The initiator solutions
prepared with different preparation methods were determined by attenuated
total reflectance (ATR)–FTIR to cognize the interaction between
Et2O and AlCl3, as shown in Figure 1. For the free Et2O, the characteristic peak appears at 1126 cm–1. When AlCl3 comes in direct contact with Et2O, denoted as method 1, the absorbance at 1126 cm–1 is much weakened and many new peaks emerge, which indicates the
interaction between Et2O and AlCl3. The complex
could react with H2O to form an associated ion pair, which
would initiate the polymerization, as shown in entries 1–3
of Table 1. PIBs with
a relatively high content of exo-olefin, narrow D̵, and low conversion were obtained with the initiator
solution prepared by method 1. A reasonable explanation is that the
interaction between Et2O and AlCl3 could catalyze
H2O to generate stabilized carbenium ions corresponding
to slow chain propagation and isomerization. Besides, it should be
noted that (1) extending the residence time from 12 to 600 s could
not help to increase the conversion, indicating serious and fast chain
termination, and (2) both Mn and the content
of exo-olefin decrease when the temperature increases
from −20 to 20 °C, indicating that high temperature could
accelerate the isomerization and proton elimination simultaneously.

c Method 1 was
adopted for initiator
solution preparation.

d Modified
method 1 was adopted for
initiator solution preparation.

e Method 2 was adopted for initiator
solution preparation.

The
ATR–FTIR spectrum of the initiator solution prepared
by modified method 1 is almost the same as that of the initiator solution
prepared by method 1, except the absorbance at 1126 cm–1 which becomes quite less because of the removal of free Et2O by vacuuming. The corresponding polymerization performance could
be seen in entries 4–5 of Table 1. Compared with entries 1–3, the content of exo-olefin becomes even higher and the conversion increases
too, which indicates that the free Et2O may result in the
decrease of the polymerization rate and the promotion of isomerization.
However, the conversions in entries 4–5 are still relatively
low because the carbenium ions are still stabilized by the strong
interaction between AlCl3 and ether.

For the initiator
solution prepared by method 2, the ATR–FTIR
spectrum shows some new peaks, such as 1010, 887, and 770 cm–1, but the characteristic peak of free Et2O at 1126 cm–1 is still obvious. The experimental results of IB
polymerization (entries 6–13, Table 1) show that both the conversion and D̵ have great improvement, but the content of exo-olefin decreases seriously. A reasonable explanation
on the enhanced conversion is that some AlCl3 combines
with H2O in hexane in advance, which provides well-dissociated
protons with high reactivity. The narrow D̵ corresponds to enhanced proton elimination or isomerization because
of the existence of free (or not strongly interacted) Et2O. In detail, entries 6–8 correspond to the same reaction
conditions except for the ratio of Et2O to AlCl3. The increased ratio of Et2O to AlCl3 results
in a remarkable decrease of Mn and the
content of exo-olefin, which indicates that the additive
Et2O promotes isomerization superior to proton elimination.
Entries 9–13 reflect the effects of polymerization temperature.
Within the range from −20 to 30 °C, a maximum conversion
was achieved at around 10 °C because of the compromise between
chain propagation and chain termination, which are both enhanced with
temperature increase. Moreover, the lower Mn and narrower D̵ at higher temperature were
attributed to the higher proton elimination rate.

In general,
the interaction between Et2O, AlCl3, and H2O, as well as the effects of Et2O on
the polymerization of IB catalyzed by AlCl3 in a nonpolar
solvent hexane, was highly dependent on the preparation method of
the initiator solution. It may bring complexities as well as challenges
for this system in regulating the process and product.

Effects of
iPr2O
Compared with Et2O, iPr2O as the nucleophilic reagent has lower basicity
and certain steric hindrance. Similar methods were exploited to investigate
the interaction between iPr2O and AlCl3 and
its influences on the polymerization catalyzed by AlCl3. Figure 2 shows the
ATR–FTIR spectra of initiator solutions prepared by different
methods. When AlCl3 comes in direct contact with iPr2O (method 1), a new peak at 1100 cm–1 emerges;
one of the characteristic peaks of iPr2O at 1170 cm–1 disappears; the peaks at 1012 and 904 cm–1 assigned to C–O–C stretch in iPr2O just
show changes in their intensity. In contrast to the difference between
free Et2O and the initiator solution prepared by method
1 (Figure 3), the interaction
between iPr2O and AlCl3 seems to be weaker than
that between Et2O and AlCl3 because iPr2O has relatively low basicity and high steric hindrance.

spectra for the interaction between AlCl3 and iPr2O in hexane.

Figure 3 ATR–FTIR spectra
for the interaction between AlCl3 and Et2O in
CH2Cl2.

Entries 14–17 in Table 2 correspond to the polymerization process using initiator
solutions prepared by method 1. Compared with entries 1–3 in Table 1, the conversion was
improved by substituting Et2O with iPr2O. Meanwhile,
the content of exo-olefin decreases remarkably. These
phenomena were related to the weakened interaction between ether and
AlCl3. It allows AlCl3/iPr2O complexes
to catalyze the proton dissociation more effectively and weakens the
effect of iPr2O on the stability of carbenium ions. We
could also observe from entries 14–17 that (1) the conversion
has a remarkable increase with the residence time increasing from
60 to 600 s, indicating the delay of chain termination, and (2) the
content of exo-olefin increases and the Mn decreases with the increase of temperature, indicating
the enhancement of proton elimination. Compared with Et2O, iPr2O did not show the clear effect of isomerization
because the steric hindrance may cause it to have a substantial effect
on the end of propagating chains only.

of the initiator solution.

d Method 2 was adopted for the preparation

For the initiator solution prepared by method 2, the ATR–FTIR
spectrum shows that most of characteristic peaks are accordant with
those of free iPr2O. The corresponding polymerization experiments
were listed as entries 18–19 in Table 2. The results are similar with those in entries
6–13 of Table 1. High conversion and broad D̵ were obtained.
H2O catalyzed by AlCl3 could provide a well-dissociated
proton to start fast initiation, which is affected by the little amount
of additive iPr2O as iPr2O does not participate
in the interaction between H2O and AlCl3. Meanwhile,
iPr2O could promote chain transfer as well as inhibit chain
termination to achieve high conversion.

Cationic Polymerization
of IB in CH2Cl2
According to the above-mentioned
experiments, the effects
of the addition sequence of solvents on the interaction between AlCl3, ether, and H2O as well as polymerization performance
were quite distinct in hexane (the nonpolar solvent). Herein, to recognize
whether the addition sequence always needs serious consideration,
CH2Cl2 as a typical polar solvent was adopted
to carry out similar investigations.

From the ATR–FTIR
spectra shown in Figure 3, for the initiator solution containing AlCl3 and Et2O, the addition sequence of CH2Cl2 has
a little influence on the composition of the initiator solution. In
detail, the characteristic peak of Et2O at 1126 cm–1 disappears and some new peaks emerge, such as the
peaks at 990 and 975 cm–1. The spectrum indicates
that there exists intensive interaction between Et2O and
AlCl3 in CH2Cl2. Table 3 shows the polymerization performances
of various initiator solutions. Evidently, the influence of the preparation
method on the polymerization could be neglected. The high content
of exo-olefin is resulted from the intensive interaction
between Et2O and AlCl3, which stabilizes the
carbenium ions effectively. On the other hand, the low conversion
is resulted from the poor dissociation of protons from H2O because the catalytic effect of AlCl3 is inhibited by
Et2O seriously. Besides, the higher ratio of Et2O to AlCl3 corresponds to lower Mn and higher conversion, indicating that excessive Et2O could promote proton elimination.

The initiator solutions containing AlCl3 and iPr2O prepared by method 1 and method 2 also presented similar
ATR–FTIR spectra (Figure 4), and the polymerization performances shown in Table 4 were quite similar
too. Compared with the interaction between Et2O and AlCl3, the interaction between iPr2O and AlCl3 is weaker. However, it could effectively accelerate proton elimination
and chain transfer to obtain the high content of exo-olefin and high conversion.

In general, the effects of ether on the IB polymerization catalyzed
by AlCl3 in CH2Cl2 are independent
on the preparation method of initiator solutions. It is a totally
different scenario with that in hexane. The inspiration of these phenomena
is that the interaction between ether, AlCl,3 and H2O is easy to control and reproduce in CH2Cl2, a typical polar solvent. On the contrary, the interaction
has the potential to be regulated facilely toward various requirements
in hexane, a typical nonpolar solvent. If we regulate the cationic
polymerization catalyzed by AlCl3 or other Lewis acid in
hexane by adding nucleophilic reagents, the addition sequence of reagents
should be considered first.

Investigation of Polymerization Mechanism
To understand
the various effects of ether on IB polymerization catalyzed by AlCl3, we proposed the evolution of AlCl3-involved interactions
during the preparation of initiator solutions containing AlCl3 and ether, as shown in Scheme 1. For the same pair of interacted groups, AlCl3/ether or AlCl3/H2O, the solid line
and the dashed line correspond to strong and weak interactions, respectively.
All the interactions exist between Lewis acid (AlCl3) and
Lewis base (H2O or ether), of which the intensity is determined
by the basicity of the Lewis base and the polarity of the solvent
together. Commonly, the stronger the basicity is, the stronger the
interaction is, and the lower the polarity of solvent is, the stronger
the interaction is. AlCl3 that already strongly interacted
with one Lewis base can only have weak interaction with the other
added Lewis base.

Scheme 1 Evolution Routes of AlCl3-Involved Interactions
during
the Preparation of Initiator Solutions Containing AlCl3 and Ether
The solid line and the dashed
line correspond to strong and weak interactions between pairing groups,
respectively.

The ether that strongly interacted
with H2O/AlCl3 can stabilize carbenium ions
to increase the content of exo-olefin, and Et2O is found to be more effective
than iPr2O. The ether that weakly interacted with H2O/AlCl3 or free ether can promote proton elimination,
isomerization, and delay chain termination, achieving low Mn, low content of exo-olefin,
or high conversion. Different preparation methods correspond to different
evolution routes of AlCl3-involved interactions. When the
initiator solution was prepared by method 2, H2O comes
in contact with AlCl3 first, denoted as sequence 1. When
the initiator solution was prepared by method 1, ether comes in contact
with AlCl3 first, denoted as sequence 2. In nonpolar hexane,
sequence 1 leads to a strong interaction between AlCl3 and
H2O, and the interaction between AlCl3 and ether
will be weak. With the electrophilicity of AlCl3, the proton
would be ionized easily to show high reactivity. The additive ether
could promote the proton elimination or isomerization (for Et2O only in this work) greatly and delay chain termination to
achieve high conversion or low content of exo-olefin.
Sequence 2 leads to a strong interaction between AlCl3 and
ether, which is helpful to stabilize carbenium ions and obtain a high
content of exo-olefin. The interaction between AlCl3 and H2O will be weak, inhibiting the dissociation
of protons to decrease conversion seriously. Compared with Et2O, sequence 1 allows iPr2O to have a weaker effect
in promoting chain transfer and stronger effect in delaying chain
termination, and sequence 2 allows iPr2O to have a weaker
effect in stabilizing carbenium ions.

In CH2Cl2 with high polarity, the interaction
between AlCl3 and H2O and the interaction between
AlCl3 and ether are always of weak interaction. One weak
interaction may allow AlCl3 to have another weak interaction
with the other Lewis base. Thus, there will be no difference between
sequence 1 and sequence 2. Moreover, the proton is prone to dissociating
from H2O in polar solvents and is loosely bounded by the
counterion, presenting a relatively high reactivity.

Experimental
Section
Materials
n-Hexane (C6H6, 97.5+%, anhydrous), iPr2O (99.0+%), CH2Cl2 (99.9+%, anhydrous), and AlCl3 (99+%, anhydrous)
were purchased from J&K Scientific (China). Et2O (99.5+%)
and ethanol (analytical reagent) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical
Reagent Co. Ltd (China). IB (99.9+%, anhydrous) was obtained from
Dalian Special Gases Co., Ltd (China) and used directly as received. n-Hexane and CH2Cl2 were dried over
Solvent Purification Assembly (VAC, USA), and the content of water
was determined by a Coulometric Karl Fischer moisture meter (Mettler
Toledo, Switzerland). iPr2O and Et2O were distilled
to remove stabilizer and then dried over molecular sieve 5A overnight.
iPr2O, Et2O, AlCl3, n-hexane, and CH2Cl2 were stored in a glovebox
(Mikrouna, China).

Preparation of Initiator Solutions
The initiator solution,
consisted of AlCl3, iPr2O or Et2O,
and n-hexane or CH2Cl2, was
prepared in a glovebox, shortly before experiments. Two methods were
taken to prepare the initiator solution. Method 1: ether was added
onto the AlCl3 solid first to form an AlCl3–ether
complex, and then the solvent, n-hexane or CH2Cl2, was added and stirred by using a magnetic
stirrer (IKA, Germany) to obtain the initiator solution. To remove
the ether not combining with AlCl3 further, modified method
1 was also proposed. In modified method 1, vacuum treatment on the
AlCl3–ether complex was carried out before adding
solvents. Method 2: hexane or CH2Cl2 was added
onto the AlCl3 solid first, and then ether was added and
stirred to obtain the initiator solution. The content of AlCl3 in the initiator solution was determined by a UV–vis
spectrophotometer (UV-2450, Shimadzu).

Polymerization of IB
The polymerization of IB was carried
out in a microflow system composed of three T-shaped micromixers (M1
for the mixing of IB and diluent (n-hexane or CH2Cl2), M2 for the mixing of the IB and initiator
solutions, and M3 for the injection of the terminator agent, ethanol),
two precooling (or preheating) coiled tubes (C1 and C2, inner diameter
900 μm), and a microtube reactor (R, inner diameter 900 μm),
as shown in Figure 5. The polymerization of IB proceeded throughout R1, and the reaction
time could be changed by the flow rate and the length of R1. Four
syringe pumps were used to deliver IB, n-hexane,
initiator solution, and terminator, respectively. IB was transferred
as the liquid from the bottom of the IB cylinder into the syringe
and then mixed with n-hexane in the tube as the liquid
under the pressure of 3 bar.

Characterization
Size Exclusion Chromatography
Molecular
weight and
dispersity value (D̵) of the polymers were
measured by a Waters gel permeation chromatography (GPC) instrument
composed of a Waters 2707 autosampler, a 1515 Isocratic HPLC pump,
a 2414 refractive index detector, and three Styragel GPC columns,
Styragel HT3, HT4, and HT5 (o.d., 7.8 mm; length, 300 mm; particle
size, 10 μm; the detection range of molecular weight, 500 to
4 × 106), thermostated at 38 °C. Tetrahydrofuran
was used as the eluent at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The instrument
was calibrated with polystyrene standards. The results were processed
by the Breeze 2 software from Waters.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(NMR) Spectroscopy
Proton
NMR (1H NMR) spectra were recorded on a JNM-ECA 600 MHz
spectrometer using CDCl3 as the solvent. The PIB end-group
content was calculated from 1H NMR spectroscopy. Figure 6 shows a typical 1H NMR spectrum. As seen, the main resonance signals observed
are located at δ = 1.1 (z), 1.41 (y), 0.99 (x), 4.85 (a1), 4.64
(a2), 5.17 (c1), 5.37 (c2), 5.15 (d), and 2.83 (e). The two characteristic
protons of the exo-olefin end group (structure A,
protons a1 and a2) appear as two well-resolved peaks at 4.85 and 4.64
ppm, respectively, while small amounts of the E and Z configurations
of the trisubstituted olefin end group (structure C, protons c1 and
c2) appear at 5.37 and 5.17 ppm. The one characteristic proton of
the endo-olefin end group (structure D, proton d) appears at 5.15
ppm. The signal corresponding to the tetrasubstituted olefin end group
(structure E, proton e) is a broad multiplet at 2.85 ppm. The methylene,
methyl, and end methyl protons of the PIB chains (structure A, protons
y, z, and x, respectively) usually appear at 1.41, 1.11, and 0.99
ppm, respectively.

denotes
the CHCl3 resonance.

ATR–FTIR Spectroscopy
The ATR–FTIR spectra
were recorded in situ by using a Mettler Toledo ReactIR 15 instrument
with a DiComp probe coupled to an MCT detector via AgX fiber. Each
spectrum was collected every 256 s by accumulating 256 scans with
a wavenumber resolution of 4 cm–1 over the spectral
range of 650–3000 cm–1. The ATR–FTIR
spectrum of the diluent (n-hexane or CH2Cl2) was chosen as the background. The measurement temperature
was 25 °C.

Conclusions
For the cationic polymerization
of IB in hexane, we exploited different
preparation methods to obtain different initiator solutions containing
AlCl3 and ether. Through FTIR measurement and reaction
evaluation, two kinds of interactions between ether and H2O/AlCl3 and their different influences on chain reactions
were revealed, which areas follows: (1) when AlCl3 comes
in contact with ether first, a strong interaction can take place to
stabilize H2O/AlCl3 and decrease the reactivity
of polymerization of IB catalyzed by AlCl3 in hexane and
(2) when AlCl3 comes in contact with hexane first to interact
with H2O in hexane, only weak interaction between ether
and H2O/AlCl3 can exist to promote proton elimination
and isomerization. As for the AlCl3-catalyzed polymerization
of IB in CH2Cl2, the effects of ether are similar
because of the weak interactions of H2O, AlCl3, and ether in polar solvents. Furthermore, the evolution routes of
the AlCl3-involved interactions were proposed to analyze
the effect of ether on the polymerization when using different preparation
methods of initiator solutions. In general, as ether was adopted to
regulate the AlCl3-catalyzed polymerization of IB, the
reproducible process could be facilely achieved in polar solvents,
while various processes with more potential are worth expecting in
nonpolar solvents. This work deepens the understanding on the effects
of ether on AlCl3-catalyzed cationic polymerization and
may provide support to achieve the rational process design for customized
polymers.
