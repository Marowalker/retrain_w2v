By the use of in situ scanning tunneling
microscopy and surface
X-ray scattering techniques, we have clarified the surface structure
and the layer-by-layer compositions of a Pt skin/Pt3Co(111)
single-crystal electrode, which exhibited extremely high activity
for the oxygen reduction reaction. The topmost layer was found to
be an atomically flat Pt skin with (1 × 1) structure. Cobalt
was enriched in the second layer up to 98 atom %, whereas the Co content
in the third and fourth layers was slightly smaller than that in the
bulk. By X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the Co in the subsurface
layers was found to be positively charged, which is consistent with
an electronic modification of the Pt skin. The extremely high activity
at the Pt skin/Pt3Co(111) single crystal is correlated
with this specific surface structure.

1 Introduction
The
development of highly active and durable cathode catalysts
for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is very important for polymer
electrolyte fuel cells. Bimetallic alloys of Pt, such as Pt–Co,
Pt–Ni, and Pt–Fe, exhibited higher ORR activity than
that of pure Pt.1−7 For polycrystalline Pt alloy electrodes, it was found that the kinetically
controlled area-specific current densities (jk) for the ORR strongly depend on the bulk composition.2 A Pt skin layer forms on Pt alloy surfaces spontaneously
in acidic media, and the electronic state of the Pt skin is modified
by the underlying alloy.2,3,6,8−11

Very recently, we have
demonstrated a distinct composition dependence
of jk at a series of (111), (110), and
(100) faces of Pt100–xCox single-crystal rotating disk electrodes, on
which well-defined Pt skin layers were intentionally formed by annealing
in H2.12,13 The values of jk at 0.9 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)
in air-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 solution increased in the
order (100) < (110) ≪ (111) so that the jk on the (111) face was significantly larger than those
of the others: Pt skin/Pt73Co27(111) exhibited
the highest jk value, which was about
27 times larger than that on pure Pt(111). Such an enhancement factor
is unprecedented, compared with a Pt3Ni(111) single crystal
electrode heat-treated in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV).9 It is essential to analyze the structure, composition,
and thickness of the Pt skin layer, together with the composition
of the underlying alloy of Pt100–xCox single crystal electrodes in the
electrolyte solution while controlling the potential. In the present
research, we have, for the first time, multilaterally analyzed the
Pt skin layer and the underlying alloy of the Pt75Co25(111) electrode, which exhibited very high ORR activity (quite
close to the maximum value). We demonstrate a striking enrichment
of Co (98 atom %) just under an atomically flat Pt skin layer.

2 Results and Discussion
First, we observed the microstructure
of the Pt76Co24(111) single crystal surface
in N2-purged 0.1
M HClO4 solution with an in situ scanning tunneling microscope
(STM). Details of the measurement are shown in the Experimental Section. All electrode potentials in this article
are referred to a RHE. As seen in Figure 1a, the width of the (111) terraces was 30–40
nm and the steps were parallel to each other. A slight influence of
the shape of the tip apex is seen on the step morphology. It was clearly
observed in a high-resolution image (Figure 1b) that the (111) terrace was atomically
flat and the distance between the nearest atoms was 0.28 nm, approximately
equal to that in Pt(111) (0.277 nm) with steps of monoatomic height
of Pt, ca. 0.2 nm. The angles between the atomic rows were 60°.
Thus, a Pt skin layer with (1 × 1) structure was formed on the
surface after annealing in H2. This accords well with our
ex situ analysis (Figures S1 and S2 in
the Supporting Information).12,13 It is noteworthy that
the STM image showed no corrugations in height. In contrast, for Pt–Ni
and Pt–Co single crystals annealed in UHV,14,15 corrugations in height (Moiré pattern) have been observed
by STM, probably due to a lattice mismatch between the Pt skin layer
and the underlying layer. Hence, the annealing of the Pt3Co(111) single crystal in H2 played an important role
to form a well-defined, atomically flat Pt skin layer.

Pt76Co24(111) in N2-purged 0.1 M
HClO4, observed at (a) 0.045 V (50
× 50 nm2) and (b) 0.035 V (high resolution, 5 ×
5 nm2) vs RHE. The tip potential and tunneling current
were (a) 0.075 V and 5.0 nA and (b) 0.038 V and 35.0 nA, respectively.

Next, we have analyzed the layer-by-layer
composition of the Pt
skin/Pt75Co25(111) electrode by in situ surface
X-ray scattering (SXS), which is one of the most powerful techniques
in understanding the structure not only of the topmost surface layer
but also of the subsurface layers.16−19 Details of the in situ SXS measurements
and analysis procedures are described in the Experimental
Section. Figure 2a shows the (00) crystal truncation rod (CTR) profile, which shows
the structure along the direction normal to the electrode surface
of the Pt skin/Pt75Co25(111) electrode, measured
at 0.4 V in N2-purged 0.1 M HClO4. It should
be noted that multiple Bragg peaks were observed in an incident X-ray
spot with a diameter of ca. 700 μm, suggesting that the Pt75Co25(111) crystal consists of (111) multidomains
tilted within ±0.1°. From the calculated curve (black dotted
line in Figure 2a),
by fitting the data (red circles in Figure 2a) with a theoretical equation (see Experimental Section), we obtained the atomic ratios
of Pt and Co between the topmost (Pt skin) and fourth layers with
0.34 ML of the adsorbate (ClO4–) layer.
Such a specific adsorption of ClO4– on
the Pt skin/Pt75Co25(111) is consistent with
that observed for a polycrystalline electrode,20 whereas ClO4– was found to
be scarcely adsorbed on the Pt(111) electrode by SXS.19 Details of the structure parameters obtained by the fitting
are shown in Table S1. It was confirmed
that the topmost surface (Pt skin) layer consists of pure Pt (98 atom
% Pt) with one atomic layer thickness. It is striking that Co was
considerably enriched in the second layer up to 98 atom %. The Co
contents in the third and fourth layers were 21 and 19 atom %, respectively,
which were slightly lower than that of the bulk crystal (25 atom %
Co). Such a decrease is definitely due to the diffusion of Co atoms
into the second layer.9,15,21 As shown in Figure S3, the jk value on the Pt skin/Pt75Co25(111)
electrode at 0.9 V (−2.97 ± 0.11 mA cm–2) was ca. 25 times higher than that at pure Pt(111) in the air-saturated
0.1 M HClO4 solution. On the basis of this SXS result,
there is no doubt that such unprecedented activity for the ORR is
ascribed to the specific composition gradient of Co. It is also considered
that the very high content of Co in the second layer might lead to
strain in the topmost Pt layer, resulting in multiple domains of several
hundreds of μm.

line are
the experimental data and fitted curve, respectively. (b) The alloy
composition from the top surface to the bulk of the Pt skin/Pt75Co25(111).

It has been reported for a Pt skin/Pt3Ni(111)
annealed
in UHV that Ni was enriched as high as ca. 50 atom % in the second
layer just under the Pt skin monoatomic layer.9 Very recently, Kumeda et al. have reported the formation of a Pt
skin layer, with the second to fifth layers of the PtNi alloy less
than 11 atom % Ni for a PtNi surface alloy formed on a Pt(111) electrode
(PtNi/Pt(111) annealed in 5% H2).21 It is very interesting that the enhancement factor for the jk value of the ORR on the surface alloy PtNi/Pt(111)
at 0.9 V was nearly identical with that of Pt skin/Pt3Ni(111),
ca. 10 times higher than that on pure Pt(111). Taking these results
and the present ones into consideration, the most important factor
for a large increase in the ORR activity is the formation of a Pt
skin monolayer and the enrichment of the second element (Co or Ni)
in the second layer. However, it is still unclear why the concentrations
of Co and Ni in the subsurface layers were so different, although
one of the factors might be the annealing conditions, i.e., in H2, 5% H2 and UHV. Further experiments are necessary
to elucidate this effect.

Figure 3 shows the
Co 2p3/2 spectra for the Pt73Co27(111) after H2 annealing by angle-resolved, grazing-incidence
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ARGI-XPS).22 The incident angle of the X-rays (Al Kα) was between 1 and
2°, whereas the detection angles of the photoelectrons were adjusted
to 75 and 0° for the detection of signals from the surface (ca.
4 layers) and the bulk (ca. 17 layers), respectively. The main peak
for the bulk (detection angle = 0°) was clearly assigned to Co
2p3/2 of metallic Co (778.2 eV), slightly tailing to higher
binding energy. In contrast, the XP spectrum for the surface (detection
angle = 75°) was significantly different from that of the bulk.
An additional peak at 781 eV cannot be simply assigned to a Co2+ species. Even though the binding energy of the additional
peak itself was approximately assigned to Co2+ in CoO,23 the satellite peak at 787 eV for the case of
CoO was not observed. This indicates that the electronic state of
Co in the subsurface layers is completely different from that in CoO.
An electronically positive state of Co is reasonably explained by
an electron transfer from Co into the Pt skin layer, i.e., the electronic
modification of the Pt skin layer, which has been linked to a d-band
center downshift.4,8−10 Our preliminary
density functional theory (DFT) calculations, carried out with a 4
× 4, three-layer model (Figure S5)
show clearly that there is such an electron transfer, with the Co
underlayer acquiring an average of +0.322 ± 0.039 per atom and
the Pt skin layer acquiring an average charge of −0.186 ±
0.006 per atom (Table S2). For Pt(111),
the top layer charge was −0.022. The marked electronic effect
of the Co underlayer can also be seen in the density of states for
the Pt skin layer in comparison with the top layer in Pt(111) (Figure S6). To investigate the electronic modification
effect at the Pt skin/Pt100–XCoX(111) single crystals further, we are conducting
ARGI-XPS combined with an electrochemical cell, together with further
detailed DFT calculations.

3 Conclusions
We have,
for the first time, clarified the surface structure together
with the compositions from the surface to the sublayers of a Pt skin/Pt3Co(111) single-crystal electrode by in situ analytical techniques.
An atomically flat Pt skin monolayer was formed with a (1 × 1)
structure. It was found that Co was enriched in the second layer as
high as 98 atom %. The positively charged Co in the subsurface layer
strongly indicates an electron transfer from Co into the Pt skin layer,
resulting in the unprecedented activity for the ORR. The present results
shed light on the structure and electronic characteristics of Pt alloy
catalysts, which can help to understand the mechanisms of the ORR
and how to improve the ORR activity.

4 Experimental
Section
The Pt and Pt75Co25(111) single-crystal
disks
were ca. 3.5 mm in diameter and 1.5 mm in thickness, prepared in the
same manner as that described in our previous work.12,13 The Co composition in bulk was evaluated from photoelectron intensities
of the Pt 4f and Co 2p3/2 lines by use of X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) after Ar+ bombardment.12,13

In situ STM observation of the Pt–Co single-crystal
surface
was performed in N2-purged 0.1 M HClO4 aqueous
solution at temperature between 20 and 22 °C by the use of a
Nanoscope IIIa (Veeco Instruments Inc.). The detailed procedure of
in situ STM observation has been described in our previous work.12,24 The STM images were observed in the constant-current mode with a
high-resolution scanner (HD-0.5I). The tunneling tips were prepared
by electrochemically etching a tungsten wire in 1 M KOH aqueous solution.
The tunneling tips thus prepared were coated with nail polish to minimize
the Faradaic current. A gold wire was used as the counter electrode,
and an RHE was used as the reference electrode.

In situ SXS
measurements was performed as follows. After annealing
and cooling in H2, the Pt skin/Pt75Co25(111) electrode was mounted in the spectro-electrochemical cell,
which was specially designed for the in situ SXS measurements and
was constructed from Kel-F,17−19 covered with a N2-purged
Kapton dome, as shown in Figure S4. During
the measurements, the electrolyte solution layer thickness between
the electrode surface and the 6.0 μm thick Mylar film used as
a window was maintained at ca. 100 μm. After filling the electrochemical
cell with the N2-purged 0.1 M HClO4, potential
was applied to the Pt skin/Pt75Co25(111) electrode
at 0.4 V vs RHE and this potential was maintained during the measurements.
The electrode potential was controlled by a potentiostat equipped
with an alternating current impedance analyzer (PGSTAT302N, Metrohm
Autolab B.V., The Netherlands). A Pt wire and Ag/AgCl (saturated NaCl)
electrode were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively.

The incident X-ray energy of 12.27 keV (wavelength: 1.100 Å)
was selected to avoid fluorescence from the Pt substrate. Reflectivity
measurements, i.e., (00) crystal truncation rod (CTR) measurements,
were carried out along the direction normal to the surface, and each
reflectivity was a rocking-curve integrated intensity, which was normalized
with the incident X-ray intensity. Structure parameters, such as the
element type (ClO4–, Pt, and Co), coverage
of ClO4– in the adsorbate layer, and
ratio of Pt and Co from the topmost to fourth layers, and layer distance
between these layers along the direction normal to the electrode surface,
were quantitatively determined from the least-squares fitting to the
reflectivity data with a kinematical calculation based on a specific
interfacial model. Fittings with all possible structure models were
carried out, and the fitting result, which gave the lowest χ2 value among all of the fitting results, was taken as a best-fit
result.17−19 In the adsorbate layer, the best fit showed that
the element type was not an oxygen species but ClO4– and therefore ClO4– was
employed as an adsorbate in the present study. The amount of ClO4– in the adsorbed layer was estimated by
considering that one monolayer corresponds to 7.88 × 1014 cm–2, which was calculated from the bulk crystal.

Angle-resolved, grazing-incidence XPS (ARGI-XPS) measurements were
performed in a UHV chamber. A hemispherical electron spectrometer
(model 10-360, ULVAC-PHI), an X-ray source (model 10-610, ULVAC-PHI),
and a toroidal monochromator (model 10-420, ULVAC-PHI) were attached
to the UHV chamber. All of the XP spectra were obtained with monochromatic
Al Kα radiation (hν = 1486.58 eV) at
200 W. The incident angle of the X-rays was between 1 and 2°,
whereas the detection angles of the photoelectrons were adjusted to
75 and 0°. Binding energies were calibrated by the use of Ag
3d5/2 (368.26 eV), Pt 4f7/2 (71.2 eV), and the
Fermi energy EF of Pt (0 eV). The pass
energy and resolution of the electron spectrometer were 23.50 and
0.66 eV (full width at half-maximum of Ag 3d5/2), respectively.
