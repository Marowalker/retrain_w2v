Modeling
of plutonium(IV) behavior during an accidental fire in
a reprocessing plant was considered using various non-radioactive
metallic surrogates. Among those elements, cerium(IV) was supposed
to be a suitable candidate due to possible formation of a complex
with TPB, but its extractability and stability have not been studied
previously under representative plutonium uranium reduction extraction
(PUREX) conditions. In this work, we investigated the chemical analogy
between cerium(IV) and plutonium(IV) in this extractive process and
combustion thereof. Distribution ratios are reported for acidities
of 1–4 mol L–1 in equal volumes of nitric
acid and a 30:70 mixture of tributylphosphate and hydrogenated tetrapropylene.
The influences of light, temperature, and extraction time were studied
by UV–vis spectroscopy. The results showed that cerium(IV)
is extracted quantitatively but is reduced over time to cerium(III)
in the organic mixture. Spectrophotometric investigations of this
reaction kinetics revealed an apparent rate constant k of 0.021 ± 0.002 mol0.5 L0.5 min–1 at 298 K and an apparent fractional reaction order
of 0.5. The activation energy of this reduction was found to be around
82 ± 2 kJ mol–1 by the Arrhenius plot method.
The combustion of mono- and biphasic solutions prepared with a cerium(IV)
concentration of 10 g L–1 revealed that the extracted
complexes, Ce2O·6NO3·3TBP(org) or Ce4O4·8NO3·6TBP(org), are reduced during the combustion. Compositions of the
resulting ashes and soot were analyzed and highlighted the presence
of pyrophosphates and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, with some
traces of cerium. Ce(IV) is not suitable to represent Pu(IV) from
a chemical point of view in HNO3/TBP–HTP solutions.

Introduction
Nuclear waste treatment
is of primordial importance to reduce the
volume of fissile materials stored in the environment and to allow
their recycling. For many years, several methods have been developed
to fulfill this task, such as evaporation, precipitation, extraction,
ion exchange and membrane processes.1 Among
them, the plutonium uranium reduction extraction (PUREX) process is
a Pu4+ and UO22+ reprocessing technique
based on their extraction from nitric acid medium. Tributylphosphate
(TBP) is generally used as an extractive agent in combination with
diluents, such as dodecane, kerosene, or hydrogenated tetrapropylene
(HTP), which is a branched C12 alkane (2,4,6-trimethylnonane, C12H26).2 This process
is largely developed on a plant scale in several countries to recycle
spent nuclear fuels. The HTP diluent was chosen because of its industrial
use in the French reprocessing factory at La Hague (ORANO company).
However, fire or explosion hazard is a serious concern in nuclear
reprocessing factories due to the flammable nature of the solvent
mixture.3 Since released radioactive materials
could potentially leak through aerosol clouds during a fire, appropriate
modeling of this phenomenon should be considered.

A representative
simulation of an accidental fire occurring during
the PUREX process would allow the prediction of fire behavior and
airborne radioactive releases. The model would ideally allow limiting
or preventing the impact of any accidental environmental discharge
of radioactive material. Several elements such as Ce(IV), Zr(IV),
and Hf(IV) have been proposed and studied to simulate Pu(IV) in nuclear
waste extraction studies.4−6 Among these candidates, cerium(IV)
has been considered a suitable surrogate of plutonium(IV) for fire
modeling because Ce(IV) possesses an ionic radius of 0.97 Å,
which is very close to the radius of Pu(IV) (0.96 Å)5 and, as detailed below, may form some complexes
with TBP and be stable in the organic phase. For plutonium(IV), it
can be extracted in nitric acid medium by TBP in high yield (ca. 95%),
forming some coordination complexes of the general formula, MIV(NO3)4·nTBP (bi-capped
anti-prismatic geometry) with n = 2 for Pu.5,7,8

Extraction of cerium(IV)
from nitric acid medium has been extensively
studied in the literature with various solvents, such as ethyl ether,9 nitromethane,10 di(2-ethylhexyl)
2-ethylhexyl phosphonate (DEHEHP),11 Cyanex-923,12 TBP,7,13 or even ionic liquids,
such as [C8mim]PF6 (1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium
hexafluorophosphate).14 However, the study
of cerium(IV) extraction in a mixture of TBP and HTP, which is an
alkane diluent of industrial interest used in the PUREX process,15−18 has never been documented. TBP is a well-known extractant, which
acts in a first reaction model as a monodentate ligand for the cerium(IV)
cation and allows its migration from an aqueous to an organic phase
as follows19  However, very recent studies
by Antonio et
al. indicated a revisited reaction scheme involving the occurrence
of the formation of cerium(IV)–tributylphosphate complexes
with unexpected nuclearities. The formation of dinuclear Ce2O·6NO3·3TBP(org) or tetranuclear
Ce4O4·8NO3·6TBP(org) has been observed by a combination of XANES, EXAFS, and SAXS measurements.20,21 This clearly shows that the monomeric system does not exist in solution
with nitric acid and TBP. In the rest of the paper, the Ce(IV) complexes
in the organic phase will be denoted as Ce(IV)–NO3–TPB(org).

Previous studies highlighted the
effect of concentration of various
components, such as cerium, nitrate, acid, and TBP, and the choice
of diluent on extraction yields.7,8,10,13,22 A study by Sakamoto et al. mentioned that cerium(IV) is back-extracted
when exposed to light but the reaction was not documented further.23 Another report by Friedrich et al. briefly examines
the reduction rate of the extracted cerium(IV)–TBP complex
in various diluents, such as benzene and cyclohexane.24 This report mentions reduction speeds between 7 and 15
mg mL–1 h–1, but there is no mention
of a reaction mechanism and thermodynamic or kinetic study.

Beyond the identification of Pu(IV) surrogates in terms of the
PUREX extraction process, one of the major remaining questions while
investigating consequences of fire in terms of radioactive material
dispersion is the representativeness of such surrogates even under
thermal stress and degradation of HTP/TBP-contaminated organic solutions.
As far as we are concerned, there is no consensus on the ideal surrogate
for mimicking the behavior of Pu(IV) extracted in the HTP/TBP phase
during a fire scenario. As previously mentioned, cerium(IV) has been
largely considered in previous studies for investigating airborne
release of plutonium during accidental fires. From an experimental
point of view, among six studies summarized by Quintiere25 for fires involving liquid fuels, three have
been carried out by considering cerium(IV) as a surrogate.26−28 However, cerium(IV) is known for its high oxidizing power and could
potentially be reduced to cerium(III) during or after extraction and
fire, which would not be truly representative of plutonium(IV) behavior.
Then, the question of its relevance as a plutonium(IV) surrogate,
in terms of airborne release in the event of a fire, representative
of the PUREX process, is still under consideration.

Thus, the
purpose of this work follows different directions of
investigation. Our first aim was the study of cerium(IV) stability
in both aqueous and organic phases. Second, we sought to simulate
plutonium(IV) extraction by cerium(IV) and to evaluate distribution
coefficients under various conditions, specific to the PUREX process.
Finally, to get a better understanding of solvent fires without the
hazards resulting from the use of radioactive materials, we studied
cerium(IV)-containing solvent combustions involving a mixture of HTP,
TBP, and aqueous nitric acid solution and evaluated the amount of
cerium(IV) that was potentially released as aerosol clouds. Thus,
the first part of this study deals with the investigations of cerium(IV)
stability and extractability in a biphasic organic–water system
consisting of an aqueous nitric acid solution for the first phase
and a mixture of HTP and TBP at a 70:30 ratio (volume) for the second
one. The influence of temperature, acidity, light, and contact time
on the extraction yields and distribution ratios is reported. The
stability of the Ce(IV)–NO3–TPB(org) complexes was also investigated by spectrophotometry, and a kinetic
study was undertaken. The second part is focused on the combustion
of mono- and biphasic systems containing cerium(IV). It was examined
in detail along with aerosol analysis and cerium distribution in both
aqueous and organic solutions.

Results
Extraction of Cerium(IV)
from an Aqueous Nitric Acid Solution
to a TBP/HTP Mixture
To determine the distribution ratios
of cerium(IV) and to compare them with plutonium(IV) values, we adopted
representative conditions of a PUREX extraction procedure.2 Therefore, distribution ratios were evaluated
for 10 g L–1 cerium(IV) concentration in the presence
of equal volumes of nitric acid (aqueous phase) and a 30% TBP and
70% HTP solvent mixture (organic phase). Partitions were carried out
in a thermostat for 10 min with magnetic agitation to ensure a constant
temperature of the extraction medium and good contact between the
two phases. Cerium concentration for each of the two organic and aqueous
phases was then determined by means of a spectrophotometric method
based on Arsenazo-III.29 The influence
of temperature, acidity, presence or absence of light, and extraction
time has been studied. Our results are summarized in Figures 1 and 2.

Figure 1 (a) Partition yields and (b) distribution ratios of cerium(IV)

(blue squares) or 1 M (black triangles) and in the dark (filled symbols)
or in the presence of light (open symbols) for 10 min contact between
the two phases.

and (b) distribution ratios of cerium(IV)
as a function of time at 303 K (black circles) or 343 K (red diamonds)
and in the dark (filled symbols) or in the presence of light (open

Cerium(IV) is quantitatively extracted in 10 min from nitric
acid
medium by the TBP/HTP mixture, with partition yields varying between
82 and 98% for a single extraction (Figure 1a). Distribution ratios, defined as the concentration
of organic cerium divided by aqueous cerium (see the Supporting Information for details), were calculated and vary
between 4 and 59 (Figure 1b), which is in the same range as in other cerium(IV) partition
studies with pure TBP30 (DCe = 8 to 14) or TBP diluted with dodecane13 or hexane8 (DCe = 7 and 26, respectively). In comparison
to cerium(IV) under similar conditions, plutonium(IV) displays distribution
ratios between 2 and 24 at 1 and 4 M nitric acid concentration, respectively.31 These results indicate that HTP, which acts
as a solvent agent, does not significantly disturb the extraction
efficiency. Thus, cerium(IV) is highly extractable and can be representative
of plutonium(IV) behavior under PUREX process conditions.

The
influence of nitric acid concentration seems to be correlated
with the temperature. At 10 °C, a lower nitric acid concentration
favors Ce(IV) extraction, whereas at higher temperatures (30–70
°C), a higher nitric acid concentration is slightly more beneficial.
This can be rationalized by the fact that higher acidities are linked
with a higher concentration of the organic complex, TBP·HNO3, and, therefore, a lower availability of free TBP for cerium(IV)
extraction. Light exposure is also a prevailing factor between 10
and 50 °C and significantly decreases cerium(IV) extraction yields.
If the temperature increases up to 70 °C, the extraction yields
are not appreciably diminished by light exposure and substantially
drop for all experiments, regardless of the acidity. These observations
indicate that cerium(IV) extraction is negatively affected by heat
and light. Both effects are ascribed to the reduction of cerium(IV)
under the influence of heat or light and its back-extraction to the
aqueous phase. Our results are in agreement with previous reports,
highlighting the catalytic role of light in the cerium(IV) reduction
process,23,24 although this effect was not always clearly
stated in most extraction studies.7,8,10,13,22

As a consequence, we studied the influence of contact time
on distribution
ratios at a nitric acid concentration of 4 mol L–1. As presented in Figure 2a, partition yields significantly drop after a few hours,
particularly in the presence of light or heat. After 1 h, the extraction
yield at 303 K is 76% for a solution exposed to light, whereas it
stays as high as 96% in the dark. For the same lapse of time, a solution
heated at 343 K presents an extraction yield of 57% in the dark or
16% with light. In fact, reduction of the Ce(IV)–NO3–TPB(org) complexes followed by back-extraction
occurs quickly and can be followed visually by the disappearance of
the yellow color, characteristic of cerium(IV) (Figure S1). When the effects of light and heat are combined,
the extracted cerium(IV) is quantitatively reduced to cerium(III)
in less than 2 h at 343 K and migrates back to the aqueous phase.
This reduction is also observed in the dark, although at a much lower
rate, i.e., after 4 h at 343 K and more than 24 h at 303 K. Therefore,
an in situ spectrophotometric study was undertaken to further evaluate
the reaction kinetics and order.

Spectrophotometric Investigations
of the Kinetics of Degradation
of Cerium(IV) in the TBP/HTP Mixture
The stability of cerium(IV)
in the biphasic extraction medium was investigated. Since cerium(IV)
has a relatively high standard potential (E0 = 1.61 V in 1 M nitric acid),32 it can
be subject to reduction by compounds such as nitrous acid, water,
or ammonia. Therefore, cerium(IV) stability in a monophasic nitric
acid phase was evaluated to ensure that it is not subject to reduction
before extraction. Our results indicate that cerium(IV) is very stable
in 4 M nitric acid for several days at 343 K and that no reduction
process takes place under our conditions (Figure S2), in agreement with the reported literature.33 Since the distribution ratios decrease as a
function of time, it actually appears that the extracted species,
either Ce2O·6NO3·3TBP(org) or Ce4O4·8NO3·6TBP(org), are unstable. Therefore, the compound was synthesized
by combining CAN with an excess of 2 equiv of TBP, and its reduction
rate was studied spectrophotometrically in the dark at five different
temperatures (287, 293, 298, 303, and 307 K).

The absorbance
of the cerium(IV) complex was recorded at 325 nm at various time intervals
in a mixture of TBP and HTP saturated with nitric acid and water beforehand
(see Figure S3 for the full spectrum of
the solvent mixture). The cerium(IV) complex decomposes steadily at
303 K in the dark (Figure 3a). Experimental data could not be modeled via zero-, first-,
or second-order kinetics and was therefore fitted to a fractional
order (see the Supporting information for
further details). The apparent rate constant k for
this reaction is 0.021 ± 0.002 mol0.5 L0.5 min–1 (303 K), with a fractional reaction order
of 1/2, confirming the existence of multinuclear Ce(IV) complexes.21 Such a fractional reaction order is characteristic
of complex mechanisms and shows that the cerium(IV) complex might
be involved in several simultaneous reactions.

concentrations. Dashed lines represent the experimental fitting of
the curves. (b) Arrhenius plot for the reduction of the Ce(IV)–NO3–TPB(org) complex in the organic phase.

In fact, different reactions could
potentially explain this reduction
behavior. The dissociation of CAN by photolysis into cerium(III) and
a nitrate radical was previously studied by the group of Baciocchi.34,35 However, this mechanism seems unlikely in our case, since nitrate
radical formation occurs only by flash photolysis. Previous studies
with highly oxidizing americium(VI) (E0 AmO22+/AmO2+ = 1.62
V)36 or chromium(VI) (E0 HCrO4–/Cr3+ =
1.35 V)32 have shown that the organic TBP/diluent
mixture seems to play a reducing role toward both elements in such
an extraction medium.37−39 In fact, the standard potential of the redox couple
Ce(IV)–TBP/Ce(III)–TBP was evaluated to be between E0 = 1.356 V and E0 = 1.416 V vs Ag/AgCl depending on the concentration of cerium(IV),20 further emphasizing the oxidative power of cerium(IV).
Thus, it appears that the Ce(IV)–TBP complexes react with solvent
molecules, yielding cerium(III) that is quickly back-extracted to
the aqueous phase.

To get further insight into the reaction,
we recorded the absorbance
of the Ce(IV)–NO3–TPB(org) complexes
at 325 nm as a function of time at various temperatures (Figure S4). Experimental values were fitted to
determine the corresponding apparent rate constants and evaluate the
activation energy by Arrhenius plots over the temperature range of
287–307 K (Figure 3b). The activation energy was found to be around 82 ±
2 kJ mol–1, which is significantly high and confirms
that this back-extraction process is controlled by a chemical reaction.
In fact, the activation energy corresponding to the stripping of iron(III)
from a di-2-ethylhexyl phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) and TBP mixture with
oxalic acid was found to be around 77 kJ mol–1.40 On the other hand, the stripping of plutonium(IV)
by dihydroxyurea (DHU) in a system of 30% TBP/kerosene and HNO3 is controlled by diffusion and shows a much lower activation
energy of 28 kJ mol–1.41

Study of the Combustion of Biphasic and Monophasic Systems Containing
Cerium(IV)–TBP and Nitric Acid
To evaluate the validity
of cerium(IV) as a surrogate of plutonium(IV) during solvent fires,
we designed experimental combustion experiments under PUREX conditions.
Care was taken to avoid heat or light exposure of the solutions and
to avoid cerium(IV) reduction before ignition. First, a kinetic study
of a biphasic solution fire was performed by extinguishing the fire
at various time intervals to evaluate cerium reduction and airborne
release as a function of time. Results are presented in Table 1. Since the PUREX process requires
the separation of organic and aqueous materials, the combustion of
a single organic phase after extraction of cerium(IV) was studied
as well. Cerium(IV) concentration was set at 10 g L–1 in 4 mol L–1 nitric acid to represent a typically
high Pu(IV) concentration in an industrial configuration. Equal volumes
of an aqueous nitric acid phase and an organic TBP/HTP phase were
mixed and equilibrated. The mixture was stored away from light or
heat to avoid cerium(IV) reduction until ignited with a propane blowtorch
under an ambient atmosphere. Residual samples of the organic phase,
aqueous phase, aerosol, and ashes were collected during combustion
and at the end of the fire for ICP-MS analysis, mass spectrometry,
infrared spectroscopy, 1H and 31P NMR, spectrophotometric
cerium content analysis, powder X-ray diffraction analysis (PXRD),
and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

was evaluated by 1H NMR and integration of the corresponding
solvent peaks.

b The presence
of phosphate in the
aqueous phase was highlighted with a qualitative molybdate test.

Observation of the combustion
in either monophasic or biphasic
fires shows a large flame oscillating around the container and with
a regular behavior through time (Figure 4). Unlike combustion of towels impregnated
with ceric ammonium nitrate, which present a blue color,42 our flames displayed a yellow/orange color typical
of hydrocarbon fires. The mean combustion duration for a biphasic
mixture of 40 mL of HTP/TBP and 40 mL of nitric acid was approximately
495 s for a circular 255 cm2 surface. In the case of a
monophasic fire, combustion ended when the TBP/HTP mixture was completely
consumed, and the total fire duration was slightly longer, i.e., 538
s. Boiling of the aqueous phase was observed in the biphasic fire
halfway through the combustion (approximately 240 s), with projection
of liquid droplets around the container (Figure S5). The temperature of the aqueous medium was followed with
the help of a thermocouple and showed a linear increase with time
from 15 to 100 °C in 8 min (Figure S6). Therefore, projection of liquid droplets can be explained by heat
transfers through the solution that also result in a boilover of nitric
acid that extinguishes the combustion. Therefore, the combustion ends
spontaneously when the organic layer is thin enough for the flame
to contact the aqueous phase.

Figure 4 Still images of the combustion of (a) a biphasic
HTP/TBP and nitric
acid mixture and (b) a monophasic HTP/TBP mixture, (c) ebullition
of the aqueous medium in a biphasic fire.

The composition of the remaining organic phases after biphasic
combustions was examined in detail with 1H and 31P NMR along with cerium quantification by spectrophotometric analysis.
Details of the NMR spectra from the remaining liquid samples are available
in the Supporting Information (Figure S7). No combustion byproduct is revealed, although the initial TBP/HTP
ratio largely shifts during the fire (Table 1). In fact, the final TBP/HTP volumetric
ratio is approximately around 3:0.6 versus 3:7 initially, highlighting
a rapid and almost quantitative HTP combustion. Although the initial
cerium(IV) concentration in the organic phase is around 9.90 g L–1 after extraction, it decreases drastically during
combustion. Organic cerium concentration after combustion is typically
between 0.85 and 0.94 g L–1, which indicates that
the Ce(IV)–NO3–TPB(org) complexes
are largely reduced during the experiment by the effect of both light
and heat and migrate back to the aqueous phase (see below).

The aqueous phases were analyzed as well and showed a slight variation
of volume during fire, due to the evaporation of water from the combustion
medium (Table 1). 1H NMR analysis of aqueous phases showed again no sign of degradation
products. However, an ammonium molybdate test highlights the presence
of phosphoric acid with formation of a yellow precipitate of phosphomolybdate.43 Therefore, phosphoric acid is a degradation
product of TBP that migrates to the aqueous phase during the combustion.
Cerium content in the aqueous phases was determined and showed a significant
growth during combustion. In fact, aqueous cerium concentration, which
is initially around 0.10 g L–1 after extraction,
increases up to 11.1 g L–1 after combustion and
evaporation. This can be explained by the reduction and back-extraction
of organic cerium during solvent fire. As can be seen in Table 1, this reduction process
occurs in an almost linear way. Boiling of the combustion mixture
could facilitate the rapid back-extraction of cerium(IV) by increasing
contacts between the two phases, in addition to the temperature effect.

The residual ashes from the combustion of a monophasic TBP/HTP
system were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and revealed
an irregular granular surface (Figure 5). The magnified images showed small grains of micrometer
size, forming a flat surface with a few cracks. The crystallinity
of the residual ashes inside the combustion container was evaluated
with the help of PXRD analysis. Most samples showed very low crystallinity
or no crystallinity at all (Figure 6). Comparison of our PXRD diagrams with the theoretical
monazite powder diffractogram demonstrates that the combustion residues
could contain slightly crystalline monazite CeIIIPO4. The presence of this compound can be rationalized by the
combination of reduced cerium(IV) and degradation of TBP into phosphoric
acid.44 The presence of monazite was further
confirmed by infrared analysis, with characteristic molecular vibrations
of coordinated phosphate tetrahedra around 1000 cm–1 (Figure S8).45

time intervals.

Mass spectrometry was
performed on ashes to further investigate
their compositions (see Figures S9 and S10). In positive mode, the spectrum showed peaks of TBP and its decomposition
products with m/z = 267 (tributylphosphate,
HTBP+), 211 (dibutylphosphate, H2DBP+), and 155 (monobutylphosphate, H3BP+).44 Further degradation of TBP into phosphates is
confirmed by the presence of peaks relevant to H4PO4+ (m/z = 98),
H2PO3+ (m/z = 80), and H2PO2+ (m/z = 65). Smaller alkyl fragments can
be identified at m/z = 27 (C2H3+), 29 (C2H5+), 39 (C3H3+), 41 (C3H5+), 55 (C4H7+), and 57 (C4H9+). Polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are produced during combustion,
are detected as well at m/z = 127
(C10H7+), 178 (C14H10+), and 252 (C20H12+). Negative mode reveals the presence of numerous pyrophosphate
anions of the general formula, PnO3n+1, at m/z = 158, 176, 194, 238, 256, 274, and 292. These compounds are formed
after degradation of TBP into phosphoric acid and polymerization thereof.

In addition to analyses of organic/aqueous solutions and ashes,
released particles in the airborne phase were sampled by filtration
and using high-efficiency particulate air membranes and TEM grids.
Surfaces of samples were imaged and SEM micrographs as well as EDX
spectra were recorded, revealing a significant cerium content for
each considered particle. More than 30 particles were detected on
sampling substrates associated with the biphasic condition. For all
detected particles, EDX analysis has confirmed that released particles
are mainly composed of cerium, phosphorus, and oxygen (see Figure 7). This phosphate
composition (CexPyOz) is in close agreement with the small
content of monazite in the residues reported by PXRD analysis. One
must also notice that particles containing cerium are fully isolated
from carbonaceous particles produced during TBP/HTP combustion.

Figure 7 SEM image and
corresponding Ce, P, and O distributions measured
by EDS.

In addition to elemental composition,
each particle was analyzed
in terms of equivalent diameter and circularity. Particle equivalent
diameter was determined using the SEM image by measuring the maximum
length (L) and width (W) of the
particle (see Figure 7). The corresponding diameter is then defined as the arithmetic mean
between length and width. Circularity of each particle was also investigated
by determining the ratio between L and W, with circularity close to 1 corresponding to a quasispherical non-elongated
particle.

Figure 8 presents
the size distribution for the biphasic condition and its log-normal
fitting. The median equivalent diameter of the released cerium particles
is close to 1.66 ± 0.09 μm (95% confidence interval) with
a relatively narrow size distribution (geometric standard deviation
of 1.45 ± 0.07). Mean circularity is also computed and is close
to 1.35 ± 0.78 (95% confidence interval), denoting an elongated
shape for most particles.

diameter for
cerium particles released under the biphasic condition.

According to the size distribution and composition
of released
particles, the assumption of resuspension mainly driven by pool boiling
phenomena and drying of ejected micron-sized droplets was considered.42,43 For this purpose, the following hypotheses were assumed:

bubble diameter in the range 0.1–1
mm (as noticed
on videos recorded during combustion experiments),

release of particles mainly driven by drying of film
droplets, which are assumed to be the most probable for an initial
bubble diameter ranging from 0.1 to 1 mm,43,44

jet droplet diameter Djet ranging from 10 to 100 μm,45

cerium concentration in the
organic phase rapidly decreasing
from 10 to 1 g L–1, corresponding to a final organic
CePO4 concentration CCePO4 of 1.7 g L–1.



According to all of these assumptions, diameter Dp of a CePO4 particle produced by drying of
such contaminated jet droplets was estimated with the following relationship
and assuming the CePO4 density ρCePO4 to be equal to 5220 kg m–3  The geometric diameter computed according
to these assumptions ranges from 0.7 to 6.8 μm. These values
are in reasonable agreement with the median diameter reported from
SEM analysis (see Figure 8), confirming that the release is mainly driven by bursting
of bubbles.

Conclusions
In this paper, we highlighted
the influence of acidity, light,
and heat on cerium(IV) extraction yields and distribution ratios.
After initial complexation with TBP and partition from the nitric
acid medium, the set of Ce2O·6NO3·3TBP(org) or Ce4O4·8NO3·6TBP
complexes is quickly reduced, which is reflected in diminishing distribution
ratios. A spectrophotometric study of the reduction phenomenon showed
that it occurs spontaneously and is accelerated by the presence of
light or heat. A kinetic study showed that the Ce(IV)–NO3–TPB(org) complexes are subject to rapid
reduction and back-extraction and follow a fractional 1/2-order kinetic
model with an apparent rate constant of 0.021 ± 0.002 mol0.5 L0.5 min–1 at 298 K. The combustion
of a mixture made of HTP/TBP, nitric acid, and CAN revealed that organic
cerium(IV) was reduced from the organic phase during the fire. The
cerium content in the aqueous phase increased drastically during the
combustion by transfer from the organic phase. TBP degradation was
also observed, which resulted in the evolution of phosphoric acid
that recombined with cerium(III) to form poorly crystalline monazite
ashes collected on the container. Particles released in the airborne
phase were also analyzed by SEM/EDS, highlighting median particle
diameters of nearly 2 μm and a composition with major contributions
of Ce, P, and O elements. This study allowed us to evaluate the capability
of cerium(IV) as a simulating agent for plutonium(IV) in the PUREX
extraction process and accidental fire thereof. Although cerium(IV)
is highly extractable in a biphasic nitric acid and TBP/HTP mixture,
cerium(IV) cannot be considered as a relevant chemical surrogate of
Pu(IV) due to its rapid reduction into Ce(III) during the combustion
process in contrast to Pu(IV) with Pu(NO3)4·2TBP
which is very stable toward light and heat. The two main open questions
are as follows: (i) Do the quantities of plutonium released during
combustion depend significantly on the distribution ratio between
the aqueous and organic phases? (ii) Can plutonium, like cerium, be
released as plutonium phosphates? These points should be further addressed.

Experimental
Section
Experiments were conducted using the following chemical
reagents:
cerium ammonium nitrate ((NH4)2Ce(NO3)6, denoted as CAN, Aldrich, ≥98.5%), tributylphosphate
(denoted as TPB, Aldrich, ≥99%), hydrogenated tetrapolypropylene
(mixture of branched alkanes of the general formula, C12H26, denoted as HTP, from the ORANO La Hague plant, France,
CAS Number 68551-17-7), nitric acid (HNO3, Aldrich, 65%),
and deionized water. Other reactants were purchased from Aldrich for
the quantitative chemical analysis of Ce4+/Ce3+ solutions: silver oxide (AgxO), Arsenazo-III,
sodium oxalate (≥99.5%), glycine (≥99%), l-ascorbic
acid, and hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37%). All chemical reagents (except
HTP) are commercially available and were used without any further
purification.

UV–Vis Spectroscopy
UV–vis spectra of
the samples were collected using a PerkinElmer Lambda 650 spectrophotometer.
The kinetic study was undertaken at a constant temperature with a
thermostated cell holder linked to a thermoregulation apparatus. The
temperature inside the cell was checked before and after the experiment.
A known quantity of the synthesized Ce(IV)–NO3–TPB(org) complexes was injected inside a mixture of TBP/HTP (volume
ratio 30:70) pre-equilibrated with nitric acid. The absorbance of
the yellow complex was followed at a constant temperature in the dark
at 325 nm (ε = 3930 L mol–1 cm–1). The wavelength is in good agreement with that in Bromley and Boxall
studies.46

Infrared Spectroscopy
Infrared spectra (see Supporting Information) were measured on a PerkinElmer
Spectrum Two spectrometer between 4000 and 400 cm–1, equipped with a diamond attenuated total reflectance accessory.

NMR Spectroscopy
All NMR data were collected using
a Bruker Avance 300 instrument with 300, 101, and 121 MHz for 1H, 13C, and 31P, respectively. Multiplicities
for coupled signals are denoted as s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet,
q = quartet, and m = multiplet.

Mass Spectrometry
Mass analysis was done using a ToF-SIMS
V (ION-TOF GmbH, Germany) spectrometer with Bi3+ as the
ionization source (25 keV, 0.4 pA).

X-ray Diffraction
X-ray diffraction analysis was performed
on a D8 Advance Bruker diffractometer (θ–2θ mode,
CuKα1/α2 radiation) equipped with a Vantec1
linear position sensitive detector (PSD).

SEM–EDS Analysis
Scanning electron microscopy
of ashes was performed using a Hitachi S-3400N (Hitachi High Technologies,
Krefeld, Germany). A representative portion of each sample was deposited
onto double-sided carbon tape mounted on a SEM support. Each sample
was characterized by selecting two or three fields of view and examining
the sample within them. The Ce/P ratio and morphology were noted and
compiled for each sample. Scanning electron microscopy of airborne
released particles was carried out using a JEOL JSM 6010-LV (with
an acceleration tension of 20 kV). Sampling substrates (cellulose
acetate membranes, SARTORIUS 11106-47-N, or transmission electron
microscopy grids, Agar Scientific) were deposited onto double-sided
carbon tape mounted on a SEM support. Each sample was analyzed over
a large range of surfaces and SEM micrographs. EDX spectra were recorded
for each particle denoting significant cerium content.

Synthesis of
the Ce(IV)–NO3–TPB(org) Complexes
To a solution of 2.00 g of ceric ammonium
nitrate (3.65 × 10–3 mol) in acetonitrile (80
mL), 1.92 g of tributylphosphate (7.21 × 10–3 mol) is added. The solution is stirred and heated to 50 °C
for 20 min and then evaporated to dryness. The orange oily residue
is dissolved in chloroform (50 mL) to solubilize the orange oil, and
the insoluble salt of ammonium nitrate that appears is removed by
filtration and washed twice with chloroform (2 × 25 mL). The
filtrate is evaporated to dryness and dried under vacuum to yield
Ce2O·6NO3·3TBP(org) or
Ce4O4·8NO3·6TBP(org) as an orange oil (3.07 g, 92%).

The NMR spectroscopy analysis
provide: 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3, 300 K)
δ (ppm) = 0.94 (t, 9H, CH3), 1.42 (m, 6H, CH2CH3), 1.71 (m, 6H, OCH2CH2), 4.24 (s(broad), 9H, OCH2).

Extraction Procedure
A solution of 10 mL of 7.14 ×
10–2 mol L–1 ceric ammonium nitrate
dissolved in 1 or 4 mol L–1 aqueous nitric acid
is added to a mixture of 3 mL of TBP and 7 mL of HTP inside a closed
thermostated cell heated to a fixed temperature. The biphasic solution
is stirred for a certain amount of time either in the dark or in the
presence of ambient light and the two phases are then separated for
cerium content analysis.

Quantitative Analysis of Cerium in Aqueous
Solution
The Ce4+ concentration in aqueous solution
was determined
using a potentiometric titration technique with sodium oxalate as
a reducing agent and primary standard. The Ce3+ concentration
in aqueous solution was determined by oxidizing all Ce3+ in Ce4+ with an excess of AgO (ca. 4.5 equiv), which
can be reduced by heating. The solution was then titrated with a sodium
oxalate solution of known concentration. Both methods have already
been documented in the literature.47,48

Spectrophotometric
Determination of Cerium Concentration in
Solution Using Arsenazo-III
The total cerium concentration
in both organic and aqueous solutions was determined using a spectrophotometric
method using the Arsenazo-III dye.29 Organic
cerium(IV) can be quantified by back-extraction from the TBP/HTP solution
by reduction to cerium(III). The organic phase is brought into contact
with a reducing 1% ascorbic acid aqueous solution, and the cerium
content in the aqueous phase is analyzed. In a typical procedure,
1 mL of 10–4 M Arsenazo-III solution and 1 mL of
0.05 M glycine/HCl buffer solution are added in a 5 mL volumetric
flask. A small volume (20–100 μL) of Ce3+ solution
of unknown concentration is then added and the pH is checked to make
sure it stands between 3 and 4. The volume is completed to 5 mL with
deionized water and the absorbance of the solution is measured at
653 nm, using a reagent blank. Cerium concentration is then determined
by exploiting Beer–Lambert’s law along with an appropriate
calibration curve. The calibration curve was plotted using a set of
Ce(III)(NO3)3(H2O)6 solutions
of known concentrations complexed with the Arsenazo-III dye. The absorbance
of these solutions is then measured by spectrophotometry, and the
calibration curve is then established at the λmax (653 nm) of the Ce(III)–Arsenazo complex.

Combustion
Procedure
In a typical combustion experiment,
a solution of 40 mL of 7.14 × 10–2 mol L–1 of ceric ammonium nitrate dissolved in a 4 mol L–1 nitric acid solution was shaken in a dark bottle
with a mixture of 12 mL of TBP and 28 mL of HTP (3:7 volume ratio)
for a few minutes. The biphasic medium was either used as is or separated
to yield only an organic phase. Then, the liquid was poured into a
cylindrical stainless steel container (h = 20 mm,
ø = 90 mm) and allowed to rest for a few seconds, before igniting
it with a propane blowtorch under an ambient atmosphere. The combustion
was either stopped by smothering the fire with a metallic plate or
allowed up to complete combustion. The remaining liquid residues were
cooled before separation for further analysis and their respective
volumes were measured in a graduated cylinder. Residual ashes deposited
around the combustion container were also collected for analysis.
Still images of identical experimental fires were taken at various
time intervals using a Pyrex Petri dish.

Phosphoric Acid Molybdate
Assay
To assess the presence
of phosphate, a drop of the solution to be tested is added into a
test tube containing 1 mL of 4 mol L–1 nitric acid.
A spatula tip with ammonium heptamolybdate is introduced and the color
of the solution is checked for the apparition of a characteristic
yellow precipitate of phosphomolybdate.
