According
to the World Health Organization, more than two billion
people in our world use drinking water sources which are not free
from pathogens and heavy metal contamination. Unsafe drinking water
is responsible for the death of several millions in the 21st century.
To find facile and cost-effective routes for developing multifunctional
materials, which has the capability to resolve many of the challenges
associated with drinking water problem, here, we report the novel
design of multifunctional fluorescence-magnetic biochar with the capability
for highly efficient separation, identification, and removal of pathogenic
superbugs and toxic metals from environmental water samples. Details
of synthesis and characterization of multifunctional biochar that
exhibits very good magnetic properties and emits bright blue light
owing to the quantum confinement effect are reported. In our design,
biochar, a carbon-rich low-cost byproduct of naturally abundant biomass,
which exhibits heterogeneous surface chemistry and strong binding
affinity via oxygen-containing group on the surface, has been used
to capture pathogens and toxic metals. Biochar dots (BCDs) of an average
of 4 nm size with very bright photoluminescence have been developed
for the identification of pathogens and toxic metals. In the current
design, magnetic nanoparticles have been incorporated with BCDs which
allow pathogens and toxic metals to be completely removed from water
after separation by an external magnetic field. Reported results show
that owing to the formation of strong complex between multifunctional
biochar and cobalt(II), multifunctional biochar can be used for the
selective capture and removal of Co(II) from environmental samples.
Experimental data demonstrate that multifunctional biochar can be
used for the highly efficient removal of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) from environmental samples.
Reported results also show that melittin, an antimicrobial peptide-attached
multifunctional biochar, has the capability to completely disinfect
MRSA superbugs after magnetic separation. A possible mechanism for
the selective separation of Co(II), as well as separation and killing
of MRSA, has been discussed.

==== Body
1 Introduction
As per the World Health
Organization (WHO) and United Nations,
by 2025, two-thirds of the population in this world will face safe
drinking water shortage problems.1−3 According to the WHO,
several billions of people from Africa, Asia, and other countries
have no access to clean, drinkable water which is free from toxic
bacteria, virus, and heavy metals.1−3 Unsafe drinking water
is responsible for more than 10 million deaths in children under the
age of five.1−4 In the 21st century, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA) superbugs, which are resistant to the
conventional antibiotics, have become a nightmare for the society
mainly in the USA.5−8 A recent report also indicates that MRSA has become resistant to
disinfection reagents commonly used to clean water.7−14 Similarly, industrialization and urbanization lead to dumping of
various toxic heavy metals in environmental water.1−3 Cobalt(II) contaminates
water via coal combustion and mining industry, as well as from chemical,
and nuclear plant.13−17 It is now well-documented that exposure to high concentration of
cobalt can cause vasodilatation, flushing, and cardiomyopathy.15−20 Because cobalt cannot be destroyed once it is in the environment,
it is important to separate them from drinking water.15−20 Owing to the serious water problem faced by our society now, there
is a huge demand for the development of the economically viable and
environmentally friendly technology which will be able to help to
create a sustainable future.1−3,7−12 Driven by the need, here, we report the development of novel multifunctional
fluorescence-magnetic biochar which have the capability for separation,
identification, and removal of toxic metals and superbugs from the
environmental water sample, as shown in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Multifunctional Biochar-Based Separation
and Removal of Toxic Metals
and Bacteria from the Environmental Water Sample
Biochar, a carbon-rich, porous solid, which
can be obtained from
rice husk, bean straw, corn stalk, and others, is a naturally abundant
resource, which has a great potential for water purifications.20−30 Because biochar can be easily produced on a large scale at low cost,
it has a great potential for the development of the economically viable
technology for our society.28−37 Because of the presence of abundant oxygen-containing surface functional
groups such as C=O, COOH, −OH, and so forth, biochar
can be used as a multifunctional platform for the capturing of toxic
metals via coordination bond.30−41 The novelty in our design is that we have developed biochar of an
average size of 3 nm, which exhibits very strong photoluminescence
due to quantum confinement effects. Similarly in our design, we have
incorporated magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) to develop multifunctional
fluorescence-magnetic biochar for targeted separation of toxic metals
and pathogens from water samples. To demonstrate that multifunctional
biochar can be used for the capture, identification, and removal of
toxic metals and pathogens, we have used MRSA- and Co(II)-contaminated
environmental samples. Experimental results show that multifunctional
biochar can be used for the high-efficient capture, removal, and luminescence
identification of toxic metals and superbugs from water.

Because
superbug MRSA is resistant to antibiotics, we have used
melittin antimicrobial peptide42,43 (Gly-Ile-Gly-Ala-Val-Leu-Lys-Val-Leu-Thr-Thr-Gly-Leu-Pro-Ala-Leu-Ile-Ser-Trp-Ile-Lys-Arg-Lys-Arg-Gln-Gln-NH2)-attached magnetic biochar dots (BCDs). Experimental data
show that by combining melittin antimicrobial peptide with multifunctional
magnetic biochar, one can separate, identify, and completely kill
MRSA superbugs.

2 Results andDiscussion
2.1 Development of BCDs
BCDs were synthesized
from the biochar network using the hydrothermal process, as shown
in Scheme 2A. In a
typical procedure, 2.0 g of biochar was dispersed in a mixed solvent
system of concentrated H2SO4 (75 mL) and concentrated
HNO3 (25 mL). The mixture was sonicated for 3 h and then
oxidized by heating at 100°C for 24 h. After thermal treatment,
a clear brown solution was obtained.

from Biochar. (B) Synthesis Procedure Used for the Synthesis of Amino-Functionalized
Magnetic NP from Ferrous Sulfate. (C) Synthesis Procedure Used for
the Synthesis of Fluorescence-Magnetic Biochar
The solution was cooled to room temperature
and diluted by adding
300 mL of double distilled water. Then, the solution was dialyzed
in a 1000 D molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) dialysis membrane for
4 days. Finally, the solid BCDs were obtained by lyophilization. In
the end, the solid BCDs were characterized using high-resolution scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), as reported in Figure 1A and dynamic light scattering (DLS) in solution
phase as reported in Table 1. Both transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and DLS measurements
show that the average size is 4 nm for the BCDs we have reported here.

synthesized cubic-shaped magnetic NPs does not emit any fluorescence
when excited by the UV light.

2.2 Development of Amino-Functionalized Magnetic
NPs
The amino-functionalized magnetic NPs were synthesized
using ferrous sulfate and polyethylenimine (PEI),44,45 as shown in Scheme 2B. For this purpose, 0.35 g of ferrous sulfate heptahydrate (FeSO4·7H2O), 5 mL of 2.0 M potassium nitrate (KNO3), 5.0 mL of 1.0 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and 10 mL of 8
mg/mL PEI [branched, MW ≈ 25 000] were mixed in 40 mL
of ultrapure water. The solution was purged with nitrogen for 10 min.
Then, the mixture was heated to 90°C under nitrogen atmosphere
with continuous stirring for 2.5 h.

The solution color was changed
from blue to black, indicating the formation of iron oxide magnetic
NPs. The amino-functionalized magnetic NPs were separated and purified
by magnetic separation and redispersed in ultrapure water for several
cycles and then dried in vacuum for few days to yield a black powder.
In the end, we have used high-resolution TEM-2100F, to characterize
magnetic NPs, as reported in Figure 1B. Magnetic NPs were also characterized using DLS in
solution phase as reported in Table 1. Both TEM and DLS measurements show that the average
size is 30 nm for the amine-functionalized magnetic NPs. We have used
a SQUID magnetometer for the measurement of superparamagnetic properties,
and this indicates a specific saturation magnetization of 39.6 emu
g–1 for the amine-functionalized magnetic NPs we
have synthesized.

2.3 Synthesis of BCD-Coated
Magnetic NPs
We have developed BCD-coated magnetic NPs via
functionalization of
amino-functionalized magnetic NPs with water soluble BCDs, as shown
in Scheme 2C. BCD-coated
magnetic NPs are developed by coupling the −CO2H
of BCDs with the amine group of PEG in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide
(EDC) cross-linking agent. For this purpose, 5.0 mg of BCDs and 5.0
mg of amino-functionalized magnetic NPs were each dissolved in 3 mL
of phosphate buffer separately. The BCD solution was then mixed with
2 mL of 0.2 M EDC and 0.05 M N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide
sodium salt [1:3 (v/v) ratio] for the activation of −COOH group
present in BCDs solution under constant stirring. The yield was 80%.

After 20 min, 3 mL of amino-functionalized magnetic NPs was added
dropwise into the activated BCD solution. The final mixture was vortexed
overnight. Then, the reaction mixture was dialyzed for 2 days in a
2000 MWCO dialysis tubing to remove excess reactants, and the purified
BCD-coated magnetic NPs were characterized using high-resolution SEM,
EDX spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and luminescence and absorption
spectroscopy, as reported in Figure 1C–H. Multifunctional biochar was also characterized
using DLS in solution phase as reported in Table 1.

2.4 Characterization of Multifunctional
Biochar
Figure 1C shows
the high-resolution SEM image of BCD-coated magnetic NPs, which indicates
that the particle size of multifunctional biochar is about 40 nm.
DLS measurement in solution phase, as reported in Table 1, also shows that the particle
size of the freshly prepared multifunctional biochar is about 40 nm.
The EDX mapping data from the freshly prepared multifunctional biochar,
as reported in Figure 1D, show the presence of Fe, C, and O, indicating the presence of
iron oxide NPs in multifunctional biochar. Figure 1E shows the FTIR data from the freshly prepared
multifunctional biochar, which clearly indicates the presence of amide-A
band, amide-I bands, and amide-II band, which indicate the formation
of amide linkage between CO2H-functionalized biochar and
amine-functionalized magnetic NPs. In the FTIR spectra of the freshly
prepared multifunctional biochar, we have also observed OH stretching
band, C–H stretching band, C=C band, and C–O–C
stretching bands, as reported in Figure 1E. Figure 1F shows the luminescence spectra of the freshly prepared
multifunctional biochar with λmax at 460 nm. Figure 1G shows that water
soluble multifunctional biochar emits blue color fluorescence upon
the irradiation of UV light. On the other hand, only magnetic NPs
do not exhibit any fluorescence upon the irradiation of UV light.
We have also measured photoluminescence quantum yield (QY) for multifunctional
fluorescence-magnetic biochar, using quinine sulfate as a standard
(Φ = 54%). The QY for multifunctional biochar was determined
to be 16.8%. We have used a SQUID magnetometer for the measurement
of superparamagnetic properties of the fluorescence-magnetic multifunctional
biochar, and it shows a specific saturation magnetization of 34.4
emu g–1 for multifunctional biochar, as synthesized.

2.5 Capture and Identification of Cobalt(II) from
the Infected Water Sample
Next, to understand whether our
multifunctional biochar can be used for the separation and identification
of Co(II) from the water sample, we have infected 100 mL of the water
sample using different concentrations of cobalt(II). After that, we
have incubated 1 mg of multifunctional biochar with 100 mL of Co(II)-infected
water sample. After 30 min of incubation, we have used a bar magnet
to capture and remove Co(II) from the infected water sample, as shown
in Scheme 1. As shown
in Scheme 3, because
Co(II) can form bis(biochar dots)cobalt(II) complex and tris(biochar
dots)cobalt(II) complex, during the magnetic separation, multifunctional
biochar–Co(II) complex was magnetically separated and removed
from the water sample. After that, we have used inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometry to determine the concentration of Co(II)
in the supernatant and the magnetically separated part.

Scheme 3 (A,C) Possible
Formation of Bis(BCDs) Cobalt(II) Complex via the
Interaction between Co(II) and Multifunctional Biochar. (B) Possible
Formation of Tris(BCDs) Cobalt(II) Complex via the Interaction between
Co(II) and Multifunctional Biochar
As reported in Figure 2A and Table 1, our experimental data clearly show that more than 97% of
Co(II)
has been captured and removed by multifunctional biochar. On the other
hand, less than 10% of Co(II) was removed when only magnetic NPs was
used, which clearly indicates that multifunctional biochar is highly
novel for the separation of cobalt(II) from environmental samples.
The observed very high removal efficiency of Co(II) using multifunctional
biochar is mainly due to the fact that cobalt(II) is known to have
very high binding with carboxylic acid and catechol, via the formation
of bis and tris complex as shown in Scheme 2. It is also reported that the binding constant
between cobalt(II) and carboxylic acid is higher than that of Pb(II),
Cd(II), Fe(III), and so forth. To understand better, we have also
performed a photoluminescence measurement in the presence and absence
of cobalt(II). We have used 305 nm excitation light for this experiment.
As reported in Figure 2C, more than 95% luminescence at λmax 460 nm was
quenched in the presence of cobalt(II). It is mainly due to the formation
of nonluminescence bis(biochar dots)cobalt(II) complex and tris(biochar
dots)cobalt(II) complex, as shown in Scheme 2.

Figure 2 (A) Cobalt(II) removal efficiency from environmental
water samples
using multifunctional magnetic biochar. (B) Comparison of the cobalt(II)
removal efficiency from the water sample using magnetic NP and multifunctional
magnetic biochar. (C) Plot shows that the luminescence intensity from
multifunctional biochar was quenched by about 95% in the presence
of cobalt(II) and is mainly due to the formation of bis and tris Co(II)
complex. 305 nm excitation light was used for this experiment. (D)
Plot shows that multifunctional biochar luminescence can be used for
the detection of Co(II) as low as 1 ppb concentration. 305 nm excitation
light was used for this experiment. (E) Plot showing the luminescence
intensity with λmax at 460 nm from multifunctional
biochar was quenched to less than 5% in the presence of other heavy
metal ions such as Pb(II), Zn(II), Cr(III), Fe(III), Hg(II), and As(III).
(F) Removal efficiency of Pb(II), Zn(II), and Cr(III) using multifunctional
magnetic biochar. (G) Removal efficiency of Fe(III), Hg(II), and As(III)
using multifunctional magnetic biochar.

Figure 2D
shows
how the quenching efficiency depends on the concentration of Co(II).
Reported result clearly shows that the quenching efficiency is highly
dependent on the concentration of Co(II). Concentration-dependent
quenching efficiency data, as reported in Figure 2D, indicate that multifunctional biochar
luminescence quenching-based method can be used for the detection
of Co(II) in the water sample even at the concentration of 1 ppb.

To understand how selective is the bonding between multifunctional
biochar and Co(II), we have performed the same experiment using other
heavy metal ions such as Pb(II), Zn(II), Cr(III), Fe(III), Hg(II),
and As(III). As reported in Figure 2F,G, experimental data show that less than 20% of other
heavy metal ions such as Pb(II), Zn(II), Cr(III), Fe(III), Hg(II),
and As(III) were captured and separated using multifunctional biochar,
whereas more than 97% Co(II) were captured and removed by multifunctional
biochar. All of the above data clearly show that the designed novel
multifunctional biochar can be used for the selective capture and
removal of Co(II) from the water sample. Because multifunctional biochar
is selective for Co(II), to find out whether multifunctional biochar
can be used for the capture and separation of Co(II) from the environmental
water sample, we have collected water samples from Mississippi Reservoir
and Mississippi River and contaminated it by Co(II). As shown in Figure 2A, the removal efficiency
of Co(II) from the environmental water sample is about the same as
that we have observed in the case of drinking water.

2.6 Capture, Identification, and Killing of MRSA
Superbugs Using Anti-MRSA Antibody-Attached Magnetic Biochar
For selective capture, identification, and killing of MRSA superbugs,
we have developed anti-MRSA antibody-attached multifunctional biochar,
as shown in Figure 3A. For the development of anti-MRSA antibody-attached multifunctional
biochar, we have used the coupling chemistry between −CO2H group of multifunctional biochar and amine group of anti-MRSA antibody via EDC coupling, as shown in Figure 3A. After that, anti-MRSA antibody-attached
biochar has been used for the separation of MRSA superbugs from the
water sample. For this purpose, we have prepared an MRSA-infected
sample containing 4.3×105 colony-forming unit (cfu)/mL
of MRSA superbugs.

we have
used to develop anti-MRSA antibody-attached multifunctional biochar.
(B) Comparison of the MRSA superbug removal efficiency from the water
sample using magnetic NPs and anti-MRSA antibody-attached multifunctional
biochar. We have used the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) to find out the percentage of MRSA superbugs that were separated.

of MRSA superbug removal using anti-MRSA antibody-attached multifunctional
biochar. (H) Plots show the removal efficiency of MRSA superbug and
Co(II) heavy metal simultaneously from the infected water sample using
anti-MRSA antibody-attached multifunctional biochar.

After the capture and separation of anti-MRSA antibody-attached
multifunctional biochar, we have used the RT-PCR49,50 technique to find out the percentage of MRSA superbugs that were
separated and captured by anti-MRSA antibody-attached multifunctional
biochar. We have also used TEM and fluorescence microscope images
to characterize the MRSA superbugs captured by anti-MRSA antibody-attached
multifunctional biochar. As reported in Figure 3B and Table 2, the RT-PCR data indicate that multifunctional biochar
is able to remove around 100% of MRSA superbugs from the infected
water sample. Similarly, the colony-counting data, reported in Figure 3E,F, also confirm
the RT-PCR data. The TEM image (Figure 3C)clearly shows that the MRSA superbugs are attached
with anti-MRSA antibody-attached multifunctional biochar, and as a
result, these superbugs are captured and separated by the magnet.

The fluorescence image (Figure 3D) shows that the MRSA superbugs are attached with
the anti-MRSA antibody-attached multifunctional biochar, and as a
result, these superbugs can be viewed in the fluorescence image after
being separated by a magnet. This highly efficient MRSA superbug removal
using the anti-MRSA antibody-attached multifunctional biochar is mainly
due to the antigen–antibody interaction which allows 100% of
MRSA superbugs to attach with the anti-MRSA antibody-attached multifunctional
biochar and can be separated by a magnet. To understand better, we
have also performed the same experiment using multifunctional biochar
in the absence of anti-MRSA antibody. As reported in Figure 3B, reported RT-PCR data clearly
indicate that the presence of anti-MRSA antibody is highly necessary
for the efficient removal of MRSA superbugs using multifunctional
biochar. To understand how selective the removal efficiency for MRSA
superbugs is using anti-MRSA antibody-attached multifunctional biochar,
we have performed the same removal experiment using SalmonellaDT104 bacteria. For this
purpose, we have used 4.3×105 cfu/mL SalmonellaDT104 bacteria. As reported
in Figure 3G, our experimental
data clearly indicate that the anti-MRSA antibody-attached multifunctional
biochar developed by us is selective for the removal of MRSA superbugs
from the infected water sample. Because the environmental sample can
contain both toxic metals and pathogens together, to understand whether
anti-MRSA antibody-attached multifunctional biochar developed by us
can be used for the separation of Co(II) and MRSA superbugs simultaneously, we have collected a water sample from
the Mississippi River and infected the water by Co(II) and MRSA superbugs simultaneously. As reported in Figure 3H, anti-MRSA antibody-attached
multifunctional biochar can be used for the high-efficient removal
of Co(II) and MRSA superbugs simultaneously from the environmental
water sample.

Because MRSA is a drug-resistant and contagious
pathogen, MRSA
needs to be inactivated after separation, before it can spread in
the society.1−5 For this purpose, we have developed a melittin antimicrobial peptide42,43 (Gly-Ile-Gly-Ala-Val-Leu-Lys-Val-Leu-Thr-Thr-Gly-Leu-Pro-Ala-Leu-Ile-Ser-Trp-Ile-Lys-Arg-Lys-Arg-Gln-Gln-NH2)-attached multifunctional magnetic BCDs. For developing the
melittin antimicrobial peptide-attached multifunctional biochar, the
coupling chemistry between −CO2H group of multifunctional
biochar and the amine group of melittin antimicrobial peptide has
been used via EDC coupling. To find out the antimicrobial activity
for our melittin antimicrobial peptide-attached multifunctional biochar,
after magnetic separation of MRSA using melittin antimicrobial peptide-attached
multifunctional biochar, we have used the colony-plating technique
to determine the amount of live MRSA.

Figure 4A–D
and Table 2 clearly
show that 100% MRSA superbugs were killed after they were separated
by melittin antimicrobial peptide-attached multifunctional biochar.
On the other hand, less than 5% of MRSA were killed when only magnetic
NPs were used, which clearly indicates that multifunctional biochar
is highly novel for the separation and killing of MRSA from the environmental
sample. Very high antimicrobial activity has been observed in the
presence of melittin antimicrobial peptide-attached multifunctional
biochar, which is due to possible formation of pores on the MRSA membrane.42,43 A honeybee venom-derived antimicrobial peptide, named melittin,
has been used as the antimicrobial peptide that can induce pores on
MRSA membranes.42,43 It is now well-documented that
when melittin has been used in the nanomolar range, it has the capability
to induce transient pores via leakage of glucose or larger molecules.42,43 It has been reported that when micromolar concentrations have been
used, melittin induces stable pore formation which allows antimicrobial
activities.42,43 To understand the possible pore
formation by melittin antimicrobial peptide-attached multifunctional
biochar on the MRSA membrane, we have performed a high-resolution
TEM experiment, as reported in Figure 4D. Our reported result clearly shows that melittin
antimicrobial peptide-attached multifunctional biochar makes pores
on the MRSA membrane and as a result, all MRSA superbugs were killed.
All of the reported data clearly indicate that the novel multifunctional
biochar has the capability to completely disinfect MRSA superbugs
after magnetic separation.

the colony-counting
technique, (A) using magnetic multifunctional biochar without melittin
antimicrobial peptide and (B) using melittin antimicrobial peptide-attached
multifunctional biochar. (C) Comparison of the MRSA superbug killing

antimicrobial peptide and melittin antimicrobial peptide-attached
multifunctional biochar. (D) TEM image clearly shows the pore formation
on the surface of MRSA superbugs when the superbugs were captured
by melittin antimicrobial peptide-attached multifunctional biochar.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have reported the development of novel multifunctional
fluorescence-magnetic biochar with the capability of highly efficient
separation, identification, and removal of pathogenic superbug and
toxic metals from environmental water samples. In our design of multifunctional
biochar, we have used 3 nm sized, very strong photoluminescent biochar
for the detection of MRSA superbugs and Co(II) toxic metals after
capture using magnetic core NPs. Reported data show that because Co(II)
can form strong complex with Co(II), more than 97% of Co(II) can be
captured and separated selectively using multifunctional biochar.
Strong nonluminescence complex formation between Co(II) and multifunctional
biochar has been demonstrated using the luminescence quenching experiment.
Reported data show that more than 95% luminescence was quenched in
the presence of cobalt(II), and the complex formation is quite selective
for Co(II).

Reported experimental data demonstrated that anti-MRSA
antibody-attached
multifunctional biochar can be used for the selective capture and
separation of MRSA from the water sample. We have shown that anti-MRSA
antibody-attached multifunctional biochar has the capability to separate
and capture Co(II) and MRSA simultaneously from the environmental
sample. The experimental result reported in this manuscript demonstrated
that melittin antimicrobial peptide-attached multifunctional biochar
has the capability to kill 100% MRSA via the formation of pores on
the MRSA membrane. Our reported data show that multifunctional biochar
development opens a new possibility for capture and removal of MRSA
and Co(II) from environmental samples. Although our reported data
seem very promising, extensive research needs to be performed to find
large-scale development of multifunctional biochar, and enormous attention
needs to be given for the design of new ways to improve the long-term
performance.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Biochar was purchased from
Amazon, US Bio Carbon 6C soil. All other chemicals such as ferrous
sulfate, PEI, KNO3, NaOH, KMnO4, EDC, nitric
acid, Co(II), and other heavy metal salts were purchased from Fisher
Scientific and Sigma-Aldrich. MRSA superbugs and the growth media
for MRSA were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC, Rockville, MD).

4.2 MRSA Superbugs Sample Preparation
Superbugs MRSA were purchased from ATCC; then, we have cultured
the
superbugs according to the protocol we have reported before.46−48 In the end, we have varied the concentration of superbugs from 5
to 105cfu/mL using water.

4.3 Finding
the Percentage of Superbugs Captured
and Separated
To determine the amount of MRSA superbugs captured
by multifunctional biochar, we have used a colony-countable plate.
For this purpose, after capture and removal by multifunctional biochars,
we transferred the superbugs to colony-countable plates and then incubated
them for a day. After that, the colony number was counted with a colony
counter.
