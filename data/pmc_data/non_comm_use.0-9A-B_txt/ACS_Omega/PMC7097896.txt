Studies
were made on the influence of temperature and oxygen to carbon ratio
(the O/C ratio) on the properties of particles during water coal slurry
gasification by taking a new-type coal–water slurry gasifier
as the thermal experiment platform, coal–water slurry as a
gasification material, and oxygen as the oxidant. The results show
that the higher the gasification temperature, the more spherical particles
are generated, the higher the content of Na, Fe, and S on the particle
surface, and the greater the mass percentage of fine particles. With
increase in the O/C ratio, the production of fine particles also increases,
while the carbon content of the particles decreases. When the O/C
ratio is 1.1, fine particles mainly exist in the form of aggregates;
the O/C ratio has little influence on the contents of the particle
surface, such as Na, Al, Si, Fe, and S. The effect of the O/C ratio
on particle size distribution is most obvious when the ratio is 1:
the fine particles are the most prevalent and the coarse particles
are the fewest. When the ratio is 1.1, the amount of coarse particles
is the largest and the amount of fine particle aggregates is also
greater. When the ratio is 0.9, the particle size distribution is
intermediate to the two cases.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Coal–water
slurry gasification belongs
to an entrained flow gasification technology, which is the leading
and key technology for obtaining clean coal.1−7 In the gasification process of coal–water slurry, a coarse
coal gas is produced, as well as byproducts such as particles and
slag. Coal particles accumulate large amounts of toxic heavy metal
elements (such as lead, cadmium, etc.) because of their large specific
surface area, which seriously endanger human health and cause environmental
pollution.8,9 In addition, because of the different trajectories
of the particles in the gasifier, a part of the particles leave the
gasifier along with the syngas, and the other part enters the molten
slag and becomes a part thereof.10 Therefore,
it is worth studying because the composition of particles has a certain
influence on the properties of slag and also directly determines the
impact of slag on the environment. At present, scholars, both at home
and abroad, have made many studies of the characteristics and formation
mechanism of particles formed by gasification and combustion of pulverized
coal in fluidized beds and boilers,11−18 and some studies have been made of the particle
characteristics of coal–water slurry combustion,19 but few studies have been made of the properties
of particles in different stages of coal–water slurry gasification.
Therefore, it is necessary to study the characteristics of particles
and gasification conditions in the new-type coal–water slurry
gasifier, whether it is for the improvement of the basic research
of the gasification technology or optimizing the industrial technology.
In this paper, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and a Malvern laser particle size analyzer
were used to test the effects of gasification temperature and the
O/C ratio on particle characteristics in a new-type coal–water
slurry gasifier.

2 Gasification
Experiment
2.1 Experimental
Procedures
The thermal test procedure of the new-type coal–water
slurry gasification is shown in Figure 1. In the experiment, oxygen is used as an oxidant and
coal–water slurry is used as the gasification material. The
coal–water slurry is transported by the screw pump and enters
the air-entrained flow gasifier through the inner channel of the nozzle.
Oxygen is supplied by an oxygen cylinder and is measured by a gas
mass flow meter and then enters the furnace through the central and
the lateral channels of the coal–water slurry nozzle. The oxygen
and coal–water slurry burn in the furnace and generate syngas
through further gasification. The syngas is discharged from the cooling
chamber after cooling. The nozzle is a new-type, three-channel, internal
mixing coal–water slurry gasification nozzle. The central and
the lateral channel are oxygen channels, and the middle ring channel
is the coal–water slurry channel. The furnace chamber of the
gasifier measures about 2500 mm, the inner diameter is 600 mm, and
the inner diameter of the outlet of the gasification chamber is 150
mm.

2.2 Experimental
Materials and Conditions
The coal–water slurry used
in the experiment is self-made coal–water slurry. The pulverized
coal for the pulping is Ordos coal. The proximate and ultimate analyses
of Ordos coal are shown in Table 1. The size distribution of the Ordos coal is shown
in Figure 2, and the
experimental conditions are listed in Table 2.

2.3 Sampling Method
The sampling system consists of a high-temperature
water-cooling sampling tube, a filter, a flow meter, and a suction
pump, as shown in Figure 3. During the experiment, the flow rate of the argon is controlled
by the mass flow meter first, and the gas velocity in the gasifier
is calculated according to the content of argon measured by a mass
spectrometer. A constant speed sampling is then guaranteed by adjusting
the flow meter of the sampling system. The sampling port is located
below the plane of the lower nozzle, and it is 400 mm from the plane
of the nozzle.

Figure 3 Sample collection system.

2.4 Analysis
Method
The particle size analysis of the particles obtained
by sampling is carried out on the Malvern laser particle size analyzer.
The samples are collected in the sampling bottle by water washing
during the test. Before particle size analysis is carried out, pretreatment
is carried out in an ultrasonic cleaning machine to ensure an even
distribution of particles in the sampling bottle and to ensure the
formation of a well-distributed suspension. The testing of some of
the suspension samples on the Malvern laser particle size analyzer
follows. The morphology of the particles and the distribution of the
surface elements are carried out using SEM and EDS, respectively.
In the experiment, the dried sample is obtained through sanction filtration
of the sample suspension first and then is baked for 2 h in a constant-temperature
drying box. The analysis of the carbon content of the particles is
done in a high-temperature muffle furnace. After calcination, the
difference in mass of particles before and after the burning process
is calculated, and thus the carbon content in the particles is calculated.

3 Experimental Results
and Discussion
3.1 Influence
of Temperature on Particle Properties
3.1.1 Influence
of Temperature on Particle Morphology
As can be seen from Figure 4, the effect of temperature
on the morphology of particles
is very obvious. Because the ash melting point of Ordos coal is 1285
°C, when the operating temperatures are 1350 and 1300 °C,
which is higher than the ash fusion point, it leads to more melting
of particles, and a larger proportion of spherical particles is generated.
In addition, the high temperature also leads to the increased volatilization
of those volatile elements, and the particles are more easily broken;
so the number of condensed spherical particles increases. When the
operating temperature is 1200 °C, which is lower than the ash
fusion point, fewer spherical particles are generated.

Figure 4 SEM output of particles
generated at different temperatures.

3.1.2 Influence of Temperature on
Particle Surface Element Distribution
The surface element
distribution of particles at different temperatures is shown in Figure 5. As can be seen
from Figure 5, the
content of S, Fe, and Na at a temperature of 1300 °C is greater
than that at 1200 °C. This is due to the reducing atmosphere
in the gasifier. The volatilization of S and Na increases with increasing
temperature, while the Fe is restored to a low valence state in the
reducing atmosphere, and the volatility is enhanced. The proportion
of these elements increased on the surface of the particles.

Figure 5 Influence of
temperature
on particle surface element content.

3.1.3 Influence of Temperature
on Particle Size Distribution
As can be seen from Figure 6, the influence of
temperature on particle size distribution is obvious. When the temperature
rises, the corresponding position of the peak value of particle size
distribution decreases in response and the proportion of small particles
rises. It shows that the temperature not only affects the proportions
of large and small particles but also affects the peak position of
the particle size distribution.

Figure 6 Particle size
distributions
at different temperatures.

The studies of Bart Buhre and
others20 show that the influence of temperature
on the formation of small particles is increasingly obvious with the
increase of the oxygen content: the oxidizing agent used for coal–water
slurry gasification is pure oxygen; therefore, the influence of temperature
on the formation of gasification particles will be strong, and the
number of small particles generated at high temperatures is much greater
than that generated at low temperatures. The experimental results
are in agreement with the conclusions of Bart Buhre.

3.2 Influence of the O/C Ratio
on the Particle Properties
In the gasification process of
coal–water slurry, the O/C ratio which is often called the
oxygen/coal ratio in the field is one of the most important factors
affecting coal–water slurry gasification. The oxygen/coal ratio
refers to the ratio of oxygen to carbon in the gasification material
into the gasifier vaporizer, and the commonly used unit in the field
is N m3/kg, which is the standard amount of oxygen needed
for each carbon element of 1 kg. However, in order to obtain and control
the data more directly, the O/C ratio is usually used instead of the
oxygen/coal ratio in practical design and online control of field
application software. The O/C ratio, which refers to the molar ratio
of oxygen atom to carbon atom in the gasification material into the
gasifier vaporizer, is a dimensionless quantity and close to the value
of the oxygen/coal ratio. For the actual operation of the gasifier
vaporizer, generally, when the gasifier load is constant, the main
way for the gasifier vaporizer to adjust the temperature is adjusting
the amount of oxygen into the gasifier vaporizer, that is, to adjust
the value of the O/C ratio. Therefore, the influence of the change
of the O/C ratio on the gasification process of coal–water
slurry, the ingredient of the coal gas of the outlet, and the temperature
of the gasifier vaporizer are the most important concerns. The O/C
ratio mainly affects the average temperature in the gasifier vaporizer,
the outlet temperature, the concentration distribution of various
substances, and the ingredient of the coal gas of the outlet but has
little effect on the flow field distribution in the gasifier vaporizer.

3.2.1 Influence of the O/C
Ratio on the Morphology of Particles
The SEM output showing
particles under different O/C ratios is shown in Figure 7: when the O/C ratio is 1.1,
spherical particles predominate; when the O/C ratio is 1.0, the number
of spherical particles is greater, and small spherical particles are
mostly in the form of single particles; when the O/C ratio is 0.9,
the large particles formed are mainly in the form of irregular particles,
and the spherical particles are less common. This is because carbon
conversion of coal particles increases along with the increase in
the volume of oxygen, while the particle size decreases and the amount
of mineral volatilization increases; so more spherical particles are
produced; however, when the O/C ratio is 1.1, the shrinkage of coal
particles is greater, the mineral fusion probability increases and
the small particle aggregates are more common.

Figure 7 SEM of particles at different
O/C ratios.

3.2.2 Influence of the O/C Ratio
on Particle Element Distribution
The element content on particle
surfaces and the carbon content of particles under different O/C ratio
conditions are shown in Figures 8 and 9: the O/C ratio has a
significant influence on the carbon content of particles but has little
influence on elements such as S, Fe, Na, Al, Si, and so forth. The
carbon content of the particles decreases with an increasing O/C ratio.

Figure 8 Element
content on the particle surface at different O/C ratios.

Figure 9 Carbon content
of particles under different conditions.

3.2.3 Influence of the
O/C Ratio on Particle Size Distribution
As can be seen from Figure 10, the O/C ratio
exerts a significant influence on the particle size distribution.
When the O/C ratio is 1.0, more fine particles are generated (particles
of 10–100 μm are more common, and particles bigger than
100 μm become rarer). When the O/C ratio is 1.1, the amount
of coarse particles is maximized, and the amount of fine particles
is minimized. When the O/C ratio is 0.9, the particle size distribution
is intermediate to the aforementioned two cases. This is because the
carbon conversion rate is the lowest when the O/C ratio is 0.9, and
the unburned carbon content in the particles is high. When the O/C
ratio is 1.1, the carbon conversion rate is the largest, the mineral
fusion probability is maximized, and more small particle aggregates
are also formed. On the other hand, the probability of fusion of mineral
particles in coal increases, and the number of coarse particles formed
by the fusion of coal particles is increased and the number of fine
particles is reduced, which leads to the fact that the content of
coarse particles under these two conditions is higher than the content
of coarse particles when the O/C ratio is 1. The trend in the number
of fine particles is the opposite to that described above for larger
particles.

size distribution

4 Conclusions
Based
on the experiment on a small thermal coal–water
slurry gasification experimental unit, the influences of gasification
temperature and the O/C ratio on the particle properties in the gasifier
are studied. The following conclusions are drawn from the experiments:(1) Temperature
exerts an obvious
influence on the morphology, surface content distribution, and size
distribution of particles. The higher the temperature, the more spherical
particles are produced, the higher the content of Na, Fe, and S in
particles, and the larger the proportion of small particles.

(2) When the O/C ratio is
0.9, the amount of large size particle produced is the greatest and
the number of spherical particles is the least. When the O/C ratio
is 1.1, the fine particle aggregate content is maximized.

(3) The O/C ratio has the
greatest influence on the carbon content of particles but has little
influence on elements such as Na, Al, Si, Fe, S, and so forth. The
carbon content of the particles decreases with an increasing O/C ratio.

(4) The O/C ratio exerts an
obvious influence on the particle size distribution. When the O/C
ratio is 1.0, more fine particles are produced (particles of 10–100
μm are more common, and particles bigger than 100 μm are
rarer). When the O/C ratio is 1.1, the number of coarse particles
is maximized and the amount of fine particle aggregates also increases.
