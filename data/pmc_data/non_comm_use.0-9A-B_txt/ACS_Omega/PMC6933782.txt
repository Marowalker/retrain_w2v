Tyrosine is an attractive target for chemo- and site-selective
protein modification. The particular chemical nature of tyrosine residues
allows bioconjugation chemistry with reactive aryl diazonium salts
via electrophilic aromatic substitution to produce diazo compounds.
In this work, we describe the preparation of 64Cu- and 68Ga-labeled 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (NOTA)-diazonium
salts as building blocks for azo coupling chemistry with tyrosine
and tyrosine-containing peptides and proteins under mild conditions.
2-S-(4-aminobenzyl)-1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic
acid (p-NH2-Bn-NOTA) was used to form
the corresponding 64Cu- and 68Ga-labeled complexes,
followed by diazotization with NaNO2 in the presence of
HCl. 64Cu- and 68Ga-labeled NOTA complexes were
prepared in high radiochemical yields >80% starting from 20 μg
of p-NH2-Bn-NOTA. Conversion of p-NH2-Bn-NOTA complexes into diazonium salts
followed by azo coupling with l-tyrosine afforded 64Cu- and 68Ga-labeled tyrosine in radiochemical yields
of 80 and 56%, respectively. Azo coupling with tyrosine-containing
hexapeptide neurotensin NT(8–13) afforded 64Cu-
and 68Ga-labeled NT(8–13) in radiochemical yields
of 45 and 11%, respectively. Azo coupling of 64Cu-labeled
NOTA-diazonium salt with human serum albumin (HSA) gave 64Cu-labeled HSA in radiochemical yields of 20%. The described azo
coupling chemistry represents an innovative and versatile bioconjugation
strategy for selective targeting of tyrosine residues in peptides
and proteins.

==== Body
Introduction
The modification of peptides and proteins
is frequently accomplished
by site-directed bioconjugation chemistry with canonical amino acid
residues with a strong dominance of lysine and cysteine. Over the last
decade, various chemoselective bioconjugation strategies, including
biorthogonal click chemistry, have gained much attention as versatile
bioconjugation tools for the synthesis of radiolabeled peptides and
proteins for positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon
emission computed tomography (SPECT).1−3

Tyrosine is a particularly
interesting amino acid for the chemoselective
modification of peptides and proteins because of its low abundance,
comprising only 3% of the total amino acid content of proteins.4 Initial strategies for site-directed tyrosine
modification involved three-component Mannich-type reactions,5 ene-type reactions with cyclic diazocarboxamides,6 Pd-mediated allylations,7 cerium-promoted one-electron oxidative couplings,8 and single-electron oxidative couplings.9 Another highly versatile bioconjugation strategy for the
site-directed modification of tyrosine residues is azo coupling chemistry
with aryl diazonium salts (Figure 1).4,10

Figure 1 Azo coupling chemistry of tyrosine residues
with aryl diazonium
salts.

Azo coupling chemistry with radionuclides was first
described for
the labeling of proteins with 111In for in vivo scintillation
studies using acyclic chelators such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA).11 More recently, azo coupling
was used for the incorporation of 111In into tyrosinamide-containing
polymers for subsequent pharmacokinetic studies.12 Incorporation of 111In was performed using a
postconjugation labeling strategy. Bifunctional chelator 2-S-(4-aminobenzyl)-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (p-NH2-Bn-DTPA) was converted into the respective
diazonium salt followed by azo coupling to tyrosinamide-containing
polymers prior to the labeling with 111In.12

In this work, we describe the preparation of 64Cu- and 68Ga-labeled 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic
acid (NOTA)-diazonium
salts as versatile building blocks for azo coupling chemistry with
tyrosine residues under mild conditions. The first description of
a tyrosine targeting strategy in a virus with diazonium salts was
reported in 2004 by Francis et al.13 The
group described the chemoselective modification of tyrosine residues
on the interior surface of bacteriophage MS2 using aryl diazonium
salts in an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. Inspired
by this first report of targeting tyrosine residues in a virus with
diazonium salts, our group recently used this bioconjugation strategy
for the synthesis of 64Cu-labeled tobacco mosaic virus
as the nanoparticle platform for cancer imaging with PET.14 In the present work, we have demonstrated the
versatility of the azo coupling strategy with 64Cu- and 68Ga-labeled NOTA diazonium salts for the radiolabeling of l-tyrosine, tyrosine-containing peptide neurotensin NT(8–13),
and protein human serum albumin (HSA).

Results
Chemistry and Radiochemistry
Many examples of radiometal-labeled
peptides and proteins use the postconjugation labeling approach with
peptides and proteins decorated with a chelator such as NOTA or 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic
acid. However, numerous attempts to decorate l-tyrosine or
NT(8–13) with NOTA using NOTA-diazonium salts according to
the postconjugation labeling approach were not successful (Table S1). No product formation was observed
based on liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS)
analysis of the crude reaction mixture and LC–MS analysis of
peaks collected after high-performance LC (HPLC) separation. However,
using 3-fluoroaniline as a model compound instead of p-NH2-Bn-NOTA, desired products were observed suggesting
that the chemical nature of macrocycle NOTA prevented the formation
of the respective diazonium salt or subsequent azo coupling reaction
with l-tyrosine (Table S2).

However, when natCu- and natGa-labeled p-NH2-Bn-NOTA were used in the reaction with l-tyrosine according to a preconjugation labeling approach,
expected diazo compounds were formed (Table S3). A similar trend was observed with reactions involving tyrosine-containing
peptide NT(8–13) (Table S4).

Radiosynthesis of 64Cu- and 68Ga-labeled
NOTA diazonium salts 4 and 5 was performed
starting from [64Cu]CuCl2 and [68Ga]GaCl3 in 0.25 M NH4OAc buffer (pH 5.5) in
the presence of 20 μg of p-NH2-Bn-NOTA 1, followed by in situ diazotization with NaNO2 with HCl at 4 °C (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Radiosynthesis of 68Ga- and 64Cu-labeled
aryl diazonium salts 4 and 5.

Chelation of p-NH2-Bn-NOTA
with 64Cu and 68Ga gave complexes 2 and 3 in high radiochemical purity >94% based on
radio-thin-layer
chromatography (TLC) analysis (Figure S15). In situ formed 64Cu- and 68Ga-labeled NOTA
diazonium salts 4 and 5 were used without
purification for subsequent azo coupling chemistry.

Bioconjugation
of radiolabeled aryl diazonium salts 4 and 5 with tyrosine residues was tested with l-tyrosine, hexapeptide
neurotensin NT(8–13), and protein HSA.
In the first set of reactions, conjugation of diazonium salts 4 and 5 with l-tyrosine in borate buffer
at pH 8–9 gave diazo compounds in 6 and 7 in 56 and 80% radiochemical yields, respectively (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Azo coupling of radiometal
diazonium salts 4 and 5 with l-tyrosine.

Next, 64Cu- and 68Ga-labeled
diazonium salts
were coupled with tyrosine-containing hexapeptide neurotensin NT(8–13).
The reaction of diazonium salts 4 and 5 with
200 μg of NT(8–13) gave respective radiometal-labeled
NT(8–13) derivatives 8 and 9 in 45
and 20% radiochemical yields, respectively, after HPLC purification
(Figure 4).

Figure 4 Azo coupling
of diazonium salts 4 and 5 with neurotensin
NT(8–13).

The mild reaction conditions for the azo coupling
reaction are
particularly suitable for radiolabeling experiments with proteins.
We selected HSA as a model protein to test the azo coupling bioconjugation
with radiometal-containing diazonium salts.

HSA contains 18
tyrosine residues, which makes the protein a valid
candidate for azo coupling chemistry. Because of the long biological
half-life of HSA compared to tyrosine and NT(8–13), we performed
azo coupling with 64Cu-labeled diazonium salt 5. The reaction of diazonium salt 5 with 100 μg
of HSA in borate buffer at pH 8–9 at 4 °C for 15 min gave 64Cu-labeled HSA 10 in radiochemical yields of
20% after purification with size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Radiolabeling of HSA.

The collected fractions containing 64Cu-labeled HSA 10 were analyzed with radio-TLC and radio-sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), confirming a radiochemical purity
greater than 95%. Coomassie staining and phosphorimages clearly showed
the expected 66 kDa band of HSA (Figure S17).

Challenge Experiments with Histidine
The chemoselectivity
of azo coupling chemistry with radiometal aryl diazonium salts toward
tyrosine residues was assessed with histidine challenge experiments.
The competitive azo coupling chemistry of 64Cu- and 68Ga-labeled diazonium salts 4 and 5 in the presence of equimolar amounts of l-tyrosine and l-histidine in borate buffer was carried out at different pH
values (7, 8, and 9). Ratios of labeled tyrosine versus histidine
were determined by radio-HPLC. 64Cu- and 68Ga-labeled
histidine were predominantly observed at pH 7, whereas a mixture of 64Cu- and 68Ga-labeled tyrosine and histidine was
found at pH 8 and 9 (43% labeled tyrosine versus 17% labeled histidine).
Histidine challenge experiments at pH 9 were also carried out with
the natCu-labeled diazonium salt resulting in the formation
of 64% azo-coupled tyrosine versus 36% azo-coupled histidine (Figure S18). These results confirmed better chemoselectivity
of azo coupling reaction with tyrosine at pH 9, whereas azo-coupled
histidine preferentially formed at a lower pH of 7.

Determination of IC50 Values
Determination
of IC50 values was carried out with a radiometric competitive
binding assay with different concentrations of natCu- and natGa-containing NT(8–13) in neurotensin receptor 1
expressing HT-29 cells (n = 3).15,16 [125I]Tyr3-neurotensin at a molar activity
of 81.4 GBq/μmol (PerkinElmer) was used as the radiotracer.
When compared to unmodified neurotensin NT(8–13), natGa- and natCu-containing NT(8–13) displayed subnanomolar
IC50 values of 0.04 and 0.16 nM, respectively. Parent peptide
NT(8–13) gave an IC50 of 0.03 nM in the assay (Table 1).

PET Imaging
The biodistribution of 64Cu-labeled
HSA 10 was studied in normal BALB/c mice using PET imaging.
Radiotracer [64Cu]Cu-HSA (5 MBq) in 200 μL of phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) was injected into the tail vein of BALB/c mice. Mice
were imaged using dynamic data acquisition for 2 h followed by a static
scan at 24 h. The PET image showed high radiotracer uptake in the
heart and slow blood pool clearance over the first 2 h p.i. Radioactivity
accumulation in the liver and spleen was visible at 24 h p.i. (Figure 6).

mice.

Discussion
Innovative and versatile bioconjugation
strategies are on high
demand for the chemoselective incorporation of radionuclides into
peptides and proteins for molecular imaging and radiotherapy. Radiometals
are predominantly incorporated into peptides and proteins through
the postconjugation labeling concept. Popular strategies involve radiolabeling
of chelator-decorated peptides and proteins, including antibodies
and other immunoconjugates, with radiometals for PET and SPECT imaging
such as 68Ga, 64Cu, and 111In or
those for radiotherapy such as 177Lu and 225Ac. Preconjugation labeling strategies are especially popular in 18F chemistry as demonstrated with numerous prosthetic groups
used for the labeling of peptides with 18F. Chemoselective
incorporation of radionuclides via metal chelators or prosthetic groups
into peptides and proteins mainly exploits bioconjugation chemistry
with nucleophilic groups such as amine and thiol as present in lysine
and cysteine residues. A rather underutilized amino acid for peptide
and protein conjugation is tyrosine. Aryl diazonium salts are known
to be mild electrophiles which undergo electrophilic substitution
reactions with aromatic compounds, such as the phenol side chain of
tyrosine, which are activated by electron-donating substituents such
as hydroxyl and amino groups.

The present work describes a systematic
study on the scope and
limitations of using 68Ga- and 64Cu-labeled
NOTA diazonium salts for preconjugation labeling of peptides and proteins.
Attempts to decorate tyrosine and NT(8–13) with NOTA via diazo
coupling with NOTA diazonium salts for postconjugation labeling with 68Ga and 64Cu failed. The reason for the unsuccessful
azo coupling with NOTA diazonium salts without the coordinating metal
remains unclear.

However, the chemical nature of macrocycle
NOTA containing three
free carboxylic acid residues seems to prevent successful azo couplings
as the reaction proceeded smoothly with 3-fluoro-aniline as a model
compound and natCu- and natGa-coordinated NOTA.

64Cu- and 68Ga-labeled NOTA diazonium salts
were prepared in situ through the conversion of the respective NOTA–amine
complexes. Azo coupling chemistry with l-tyrosine, NT(8–13),
and HSA proceeded rapidly under mild aqueous conditions in good radiochemical
yields, making the labeling strategy particularly compatible with
the sensitive nature of delicate biomolecules such as proteins. The
chemistry is highly versatile and flexible as demonstrated with the
labeling of amino acid tyrosine, hexapeptide NT(8–13), and
protein HSA.

The chemoselectivity of azo coupling reactions
with diazonium salts
toward tyrosine and histidine residues was recently studied.17−19 Results are varying greatly, but several studies that described
a high degree of tyrosine site-specificity in azo coupling reactions
were reported even in the presence of competing amino acid targets
such as histidine.19 Other studies demonstrated
more selectivity for tyrosine at pH 8.5 but increased selectivity
for histidine at pH 9.1 and higher.20

In contrast, a more recent study reported more selectivity for
tyrosine residues over histidine at pH 4–10, with a significant
increase in selectivity at pH 7.21 In the
present work using radiometal-containing aryl diazonium salts, challenging
experiments with tyrosine and histidine suggested a trend for histidine
labeling occurring predominantly at pH 7, whereas tyrosine labeling
predominantly occurred at higher pH in the range of 8–9. This
trend may be attributed to the difference in pKa values of the ionizable side chains of these amino acid residues.
The pKa of histidine (6.0) is lower than
the pKa of tyrosine (10.5); therefore,
there would be a greater proportion of deprotonated histidine in solution
at pH 7 to react in the azo coupling reaction. When both amino acids
are deprotonated, tyrosine preferentially reacts in the azo coupling
reaction at pH 9, and there would likely be a sufficient proportion
of deprotonated tyrosine in solution to compete with histidine in
the azo coupling reaction. Based on these results and supporting reports
in the literature, coupling of radiometal-containing aryl diazonium
salts with peptides and proteins should be carried out at pH ≈
9 to achieve a favorable tyrosine selectivity profile.

Modification
of peptides and proteins can affect binding affinity
to respective target proteins and receptors, which is a special challenge
for the design and synthesis of radiolabeled peptides and proteins
for targeted molecular imaging and therapy. In this line, we tested
the effect of radiolabeled diazo conjugates of NT(8–13) on
the binding to neurotensin receptor NTR1. Recently, we have measured
several multimeric neurotensin(8–13) analogues for their binding
to the NTR1 to identify suitable candidates for radiolabeling with 18F.15,16 All tested NT(8–13) were
modified at the N-terminal end of the peptide. Most peptides displayed
rather low inhibitory potency compared to parent compound NT(8–13).
In the present study, NT(8–13) was modified at the tyrosine
residue. The radiometric competitive binding assay gave IC50 values in the subnanomolar range (0.04 and 0.16 nM) close to the
IC50 value of parent compound NT(8–13) (IC50 = 0.03 nM). These data reveal that the introduction of the bulky
diazo motif at the tyrosine residue had only little effect on the
receptor binding. When binding affinities were compared to other neurotensin
NT(8–13) analogues in the literature, which were modified at
the N-terminal end of the peptide to facilitate radiolabeling with 64Cu, 68Ga, or 177Lu, IC50 and Kd values were in the nanomolar
range.22−24

Given that IC50 values of the tyrosine-modified
peptide
we have described were in the picomolar range, the N-terminal modified
peptides described in the literature displayed lower inhibitory potency
than the tyrosine-modified peptide. The tolerance of the tyrosine
residue in NT(8–13) for the introduction of large substituents,
while retaining favorable receptor binding was demonstrated with various 125I-labeled neurotensin derivatives.25

Experiments with 64Cu-labeled HSA in normal mice
further
confirmed the suitability of the preconjugation labeling method with
radiometal aryl diazonium salts for the preparation of radiolabeled
proteins for PET imaging. The obtained biodistribution profile of 64Cu-labeled HSA is characteristic for a blood pool marker.
A significant heart uptake and slow blood clearance, as well as radioactivity
accumulation in the liver over time, are typical for proteins such
as HSA (Figure S21). The results are comparable
to the recent literature describing PET imaging with 18F-labeled rat serum albumin (RSA) and 64Cu-labeled HSA.26,27 In a 2015 study conducted by Jagoda et al., PET imaging with 18F-labeled RSA showed uptake in the heart and peripheral vasculature,
with retention up to 2.5 h postinjection.26 These findings are comparable to those of the present study, where
PET imaging with 64Cu-labeled HSA also showed uptake in
the heart and arteries, with retention up to 2 h postinjection. In
a 2016 study conducted by Choe et al., PET imaging with 64Cu-labeled HSA showed liver metabolism from 16 to 45 h postinjection.27 These findings are also comparable to those
of the present study, where PET imaging with 64Cu-labeled
HSA also showed liver metabolism 24 h postinjection. The favorable
in vivo profile of 64Cu-labeled HSA, prepared using the
described diazonium-based tyrosine labeling method, further demonstrates
the feasibility of this strategy for the introduction of radiometals
into proteins.

Conclusions
Azo coupling is a versatile bioconjugation
technique that can be
applied to PET radiochemistry for the chemoselective incorporation
of radionuclides onto tyrosine residues under mild conditions. Preparation
of 64Cu- and 68Ga-labeled diazonium salts and
their subsequent bioconjugation with tyrosine residues was carried
out on the amino acid, peptide, and protein level to afford the expected
azo conjugates in good radiochemical yields. Determination of IC50 values with natCu- and natGa-labeled
neurotensin NT(8–13) confirmed tolerance of the tyrosine residue
in NT(8–13) to accommodate bulky substituents. PET imaging
studies with 64Cu-labeled HSA prepared by azo coupling
chemistry showed the expected biodistribution profile, with significant
uptake in the heart and slow clearance from the blood. The described
preconjugation labeling strategy proceeds rapidly under mild conditions
with various tyrosine-containing biomolecules making azo coupling
chemistry a highly efficient and versatile labeling tool for the incorporation
of radiometals into tyrosine residues of peptides and proteins.

reaction in high specific activity on a biomedical cyclotron from
Washington University, St. Louis, USA. It is typically delivered in
12 μL of 0.01 N HCl ([64Cu]CuCl2). A 50
mCi (1850 MBq) iThemba Laboratories 68Ge/68Ga-generator
from isoSolutions Inc. (Vancouver, B.C., Canada) was used as the 68Ga source. Buffers for radiolabeling with 64Cu
and 68Ga were of trace-metal grade. Radio-TLC was performed
using either silica plates (TLC silica gel 60 F254, EMD Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA) or reverse phase (RP-18) plates (ALUGRAM RP18W/UV254 by Macherey-Nagel, Dueren, Germany). SEC was performed

°C for 10 min. The radiolabeled diazonium salt product was used,
in situ, for the next step without purification.

General Procedure for Bioconjugation with Tyrosine Residues
Using 64Cu- or 68Ga-Labeled Diazonium Salts 4 and 5
To 100 μg of peptide NT(8–13)
or protein (HSA) in 0.1 M borate buffer pH 8.8, the 64Cu-
or 68Ga-labeled diazonium salt was added. The pH was adjusted
to 9 with the addition of 4 M NaOH, and the reaction was shaken at
4 °C for 30 min. Peptide products were purified by HPLC (5% CH3CN 0–15 min, 5–30% CH3CN 15–25
min, 30–80% CH3CN 25–30 min, and 80% CH3CN 30–40 min) and characterized by radio-TLC and radio-HPLC,
based on the retention time of the nonradioactive reference compound.
Protein products were purified by SEC and characterized by radio-TLC
and SDS-PAGE with Coomassie staining and radioactive scan. The 64Cu- and 68Ga-labeled l-tyrosine 6 and 7 were afforded in 56 and 80% radiochemical
yields, respectively; 68Ga- and 64Cu-labeled
neurotensin NT(8–13) derivatives 8 and 9 were isolated in 12 and 45% radiochemical yields, respectively; 64Cu-labeled HSA 10 was obtained in 20% radiochemical
yield.

IC50 Determination
IC50 values
were determined using a radiometric competitive binding assay.15,16 [125I]Tyr3-neurotensin, with a molar activity
of 81.4 GBq/μmol from PerkinElmer, was used as a radiotracer.
HT-29 cells plated on tissue culture T-25/75 flasks were incubated
in culture media in humidified 5% CO/95% air at 37 °C for three
to five days. Cells were washed three times with Tris buffer, suspended
in 8 mL of Tris buffer, and homogenized. Cell densities ranged from
4 × 106 to 7 × 106 cells/mL.

A 100 μM peptide stock solution was prepared using water, and
serial dilutions were prepared using Tris buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl,
1 mM EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.5 mM o-phenanthroline, cOmplete, EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail,
pH 7.4), with concentrations ranging from 10–5 to
10–12 M. A 100 μL aliquot of peptide solution
was combined with 200 μL of cell homogenate, 500 μL of
Tris buffer, and 200 μL of the radiotracer (n = 3). The solution was incubated at room temperature for 30 min.
The free and bound ligands were separated by filtration, using Whatman
GF/B glass fiber filters and a Brandel cell harvester (Gaithersburg,
MD, USA). Filters were washed three times with Tris buffer and quantified
using a gamma counter (Wizard-2, PerkinElmer). IC50 values
were calculated by nonlinear regression, using sigmoidal dose-response
curves from GraphPad Prism 7 software (Figure S20).

SDS-PAGE
SDS-PAGE was used to characterize 64Cu-labeled HSA. Radiolabeled proteins were visualized with a combination
of Coomassie staining and a radioactive scan of the gel. To a 30 μL
aliquot of each sample, 6 μL of 5× Laemmli stain with dithiothreitol
was added before incubation at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were
run, along with a protein ladder, on a Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN TGX precast
gel (10% Tris buffer) in a Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN Tetra Cell with 1×
running buffer at 200 V (35 mA) for 40 min. The gel was exposed to
a Fujifilm BAS-MS 2025 imaging plate for 45 min, and the imaging plate
was scanned using a Typhoon 9400 phosphor imager. The gel was then
incubated in Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad) for 20 min at
room temperature before destaining with destaining solution.

PET Imaging Studies
All animal experiments were carried
out in accordance with guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal
Care (CCAC) and approved by the local Animal Care Committee of the
Cross Cancer Institute. PET experiments using a normal BALB/c mouse
were carried out to determine the biodistribution profile of 64Cu-labeled HSA 10. Isoflurane in 100% oxygen
(gas flow, 1 L/min) was used as a general anesthetic. Body temperature
was kept constant at 37 °C. Following anesthetization, the mouse
was immobilized in the prone position in the center field of view
of an Inveon preclinical PET scanner (Siemens Preclinical Solutions,
Knoxville, TN, USA). Radioactivity of the injection solution in a
0.5 mL syringe was measured using a dose calibrator (AtomlabTM 300,
Biodex Medical Systems, New York, U.S.A.) prior to injection. The
emission scan of a 120 min dynamic PET acquisition was initiated.
Following a 15 s delay, 5 MBq of radiochemically pure 64Cu-labeled HSA 10 in 200 μL of PBS was injected
into the tail vein. Data acquisition continued for 120 min in the
3D list mode, after the experiment list mode data were sorted into
sinograms with 61 time frames (10 × 2, 8 × 5, 6 × 10,
6 × 20, 8 × 60, 10 × 120, and 9 × 300 s). In addition
to the dynamic 120 min scan, another static scan was measured after
24 h p.i. with a scan duration time of 60 min. Image files were reconstructed
using the maximum a posteriori reconstruction mode. Correction for
partial volume effects was not performed. Image files were further
processed using ROVER v2.0.21 software (ABX GmbH, Radeberg, Germany).
Masks defining 3D regions of interest (ROI) were set, and the ROIs
were defined by 50% thresholding. Mean standardized uptake values
[SUVmean = (activity/mL tissue)/(injected activity/body weight), mL/g]
were calculated for each ROI, and time-activity curves were generated
using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, U.S.A.).
