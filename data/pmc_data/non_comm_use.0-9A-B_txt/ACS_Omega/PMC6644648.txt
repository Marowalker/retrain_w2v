Metal
fluorides are gathering significant interest for use in many
applications, such as optical glasses, chemical sensors, and solid
electrolytes using fluoride ion batteries, due to their high transparency
over a wide wavelength range (ultraviolet to infrared) and fast fluoride
ion conductivity. Here, we present a topotactic route for synthesizing
thin films of fluorite-type Ba0.5Bi0.5F2.5 (BBF), a promising fluoride ion conductor, from perovskite-type
BaBiO3 (BBO) precursor films by fluorination using poly(vinylidene
fluoride). The fluorination reaction fully converted BBO to BBF without
stopping at the oxyfluoride stage. The BBF films obtained at relatively
low reaction temperatures (150–200 °C) showed Ba/Bi cation
ordering in the [001] direction, indicating that the cation framework
of perovskite BBO was maintained during the fluorination reaction.
Meanwhile, increasing the fluorination temperature led to mixtures
of cations, resulting in random distribution of Ba and Bi. This demonstrates
that the degree of cation ordering in BBF can be controlled by adjusting
the fluorination temperature.

1 Introduction
Metal
fluorides have attracted considerable research attention
because they exhibit high transmittance over a wide wavelength region
(ultraviolet to infrared) and fast fluoride ion conductivity. As such,
they have great potential for use in optical glasses, chemical sensors,
scintillation materials, and solid electrolytes used in fluoride ion
batteries.1−5 Fluoride materials can typically be categorized into two groups:
alkaline-earth fluorides (AF2) with fluorite-type structures
(Fm3̅m) and rare-earth fluorides
(RF3) with tysonite-type structures (P3̅c1). An example of fluorite-type fluorides
is CaF2, which shows high transmittance with a low reflective
index in the ultraviolet to infrared regions.1 Meanwhile, tysonite-type La0.95Sr0.05F2.95 and Sm0.95Ca0.05F2.95 are known as fast fluoride ion conductors with ionic conductivity
of ∼10–4 S/cm at room temperature.6,7 In general, these metal fluorides are synthesized by solid phase
reactions,8 hydrothermal synthesis,9 melt growth techniques,10 and fluorination of metal precursor compounds (e.g., oxides, chlorides,
and carbonates) with gaseous agents such as F2 and hydrogen
fluoride.11

Recently, topochemical
fluorination reactions using poly(vinylidene
fluoride) (PVDF) have been extensively studied as methods to fluorinate
metal oxides.12−22 PVDF-mediated fluorination is advantageous for synthesizing phase-pure
transition metal oxyfluorides without forming undesired impurity phases,
which are frequently formed by fluorination using NH4F,
MF2 (M: Cu, Ni, Zn), XeF2 solids, and F2 gas.12 Moreover, PVDF is stable
in air at room temperature and works as a nonoxidizing reagent, such
that it promotes both insertion of F– and also substitution
of F– for O2– during the fluorination
reaction.23 For instance, bulk polycrystalline
Ca2Cu2+O2F2 and Sr2Ti4+O3F2 can be synthesized
from Ca2Cu2+O3 and Sr2Ti4+O4 precursors with PVDF,12 where the oxidation states of the metal ions were unchanged
throughout the reaction. In contrast, bulk SrFe3+/4+O3−δ can be reductively transformed into SrFe3+O2F by PVDF.13

Metal oxide epitaxial thin films have also been chosen as precursors
for PVDF-mediated fluorination, not only to obtain single crystalline
phases of metal oxyfluorides but to also expand the range of fluorine
content due to enhanced reactivity.24 Indeed,
topotactic fluorination using PVDF has been applied to epitaxial thin
films of SrFeO3−δ, SrCoO2.5, (La,Nd)NiO3, and Sr2RuO4 to yield thin films of
SrFeO3–xFx, SrCoO1.9F0.5, (La,Nd)NiO3–xFx, and Sr2RuO3F2, respectively.24−30

In this study, we focus on perovskite Ba2+Bi3+/5+O3 (BBO) thin films, in which Bi3+ and Bi5+ ions are regularly aligned, as oxide precursors
for topotactic
fluorination using PVDF. BBO shows the semiconducting behavior due
to commensurate charge-density waves31 and
is known as a parent compound of the superconducting Ba0.6K0.4BiO3 with a critical temperature of 30
K.32 BBO is expected to have high reactivity
with the reducing agent PVDF due to the presence of high-valence B-site
cations (Bi5+) as well as the flexibility of its valence
(Bi3+ and Bi5+). Through PVDF-mediated fluorination,
BBO in the thin film form was transformed into the fluorite-structure
Ba0.5Bi0.5F2.5 (BBF), known to be
a fluorine ionic conductor,33 without producing
oxyfluorides. Furthermore, the BBF films obtained at relatively low
temperatures showed Ba/Bi ordering along the [001] direction, indicating
that the cation framework was maintained during the fluorination reaction.
This demonstrates that the Ba and Bi arrangement in BBF can be controlled
by adjusting the PVDF-mediated fluorination temperature.

2 Experimental Section
Perovskite BBO precursor films were
grown on SrTiO3(001)
(STO, Shinkosha Co.) substrates using a pulsed-laser deposition (PLD)
method. As a PLD target, we used a polycrystalline BBO ceramic pellet
prepared from mixed powders of BaCO3 (Wako Pure Chemical
Industries) and Bi2O3 (Kojundo Chemical Laboratory
Co.) using a solid-state reaction (presintering at 800 °C for
24 h and sintering at 800 °C for 24 h). A KrF excimer laser (wavelength
λ = 248 nm) with an energy of 1.9 J/cm2 per shot
was used for the ablation of the BBO target. The substrate temperature
and the oxygen partial pressure were set at 500 °C and 30 mTorr,
respectively, during the film deposition run. The obtained BBO films
were then subjected to fluorination using PVDF (Fluorochem Ltd.) under
an Ar gas flow at annealing temperatures (Tf) of 100–450 °C for 6–48 h. Following the methods
previously developed by our group, the films were covered with Al
foil during fluorination to avoid adhesion of the charcoal-like residue
produced by the decomposition of PVDF.24,29,30 The thicknesses of the precursor films were set at
∼40 nm, as measured by X-ray reflectivity (Bruker AXS D8 DISCOVER).

The crystal structures of the films were examined by X-ray diffraction
(XRD) with a Cu Kα radiation (Bruker AXS D8 DISCOVER). A diffractometer
in parallel beam geometry was equipped with one- and two-dimensional
detectors, allowing the calculation of both out-of-plane and in-plane
lattice constants, respectively, from the XRD data obtained at each
of these detectors. Chemical compositions of the films were analyzed
by employing scanning electron microscope–energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (SEM–EDS). The electron-accelerating voltage
was set to 4 or 10 keV, which corresponded to surface-sensitive and
bulk-sensitive EDS measurements, respectively.

3 Results
and Discussion
Figure 1a exhibits
a 2θ–θ XRD pattern of the BBO precursor thin film
deposited on a STO substrate, verifying the formation of 001-oriented
perovskite BBO without any secondary phases. Figure 1b shows the two-dimensional 2θ–γ
image around the STO 110 diffraction pattern of the BBO precursor
thin film. The BBO 110 diffraction located at 2θ = 29.1°
was clearly observed as a spot, indicating that the BBO film has the
same in-plane orientation as the STO substrate. The full width at
half-maximum (FWHM) of the BBO 110 diffraction was 0.73° along
the γ-direction (Figure 1c), indicating that the film had a relatively high crystallinity.
The a- and c- axis lengths of the
film were calculated as 0.434 and 0.434 nm, respectively, which are
in good agreement with the previously reported values of BBO film
grown on STO by molecular beam epitaxy (a = 0.4353
nm, c = 0.4334 nm).34 These
lattice constants were much larger than those of cubic STO (a = c = 0.3905 nm), indicating that that
the BBO film was fully relaxed.

We next examined the chemical composition and the crystal
structure
of the film obtained by the fluorination of BBO precursor at Tf = 200 °C for 24 h. We confirmed that
the cation compositions (Ba and Bi) did not change during fluorination
by measuring the 10 keV EDS of the BBO precursor film and the film
reacted with PVDF at Tf = 200 °C
for 24 h (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). Figure 2 shows the 4 keV
EDS results of the BBO precursor and the fluorinated films, where
the spectra were normalized to the Bi Mα peaks. After fluorination,
an intense F Kα peak appeared and the O Kα peak was substantially
suppressed. This implies that the BBO precursor changed into a fluoride
by the PVDF-mediated fluorination reaction, although a tiny amount
of oxygen remained even after the fluorination, which is possibly
due to the presence of minor contamination layers on the surface and/or
at the film/substrate interface. That is, the fluorination reaction
did not stop at the oxyfluoride stage, but rather the oxygen was completely
removed from the precursor BaBiO3.

the film reacted with PVDF at Tf = 200
°C for 24 h.

Figure 3a shows
a 2θ–θ XRD pattern of the film obtained by fluorination
of the BBO precursor at Tf = 200 °C
for 24 h. Notably, the perovskite BBO diffraction peaks at 001, 002,
and 003 disappeared and new peaks appeared at 2θ ≈ 14.8,
29.7, and 61.5°. The peaks at 2θ ≈ 29.7 and 61.5°
(d = 0.300 and 0.151 nm) were indexed to the 002
and 004 diffractions of BBF with a fluorite structure, respectively.33 The c-axis length of the BBF
film (0.602 nm) is much longer than that of the BBO precursor film
(0.434 nm), suggesting the intercalation of fluoride ions between
the Ba and the Bi sites. The peak at 2θ ≈ 14.8°
(d = 0.600 nm) can be assigned to the 001 superlattice
diffraction peak, indicating ordering of the Ba and Bi cations perpendicular
to the film plane in the fluorinated film. From the XRD and EDS results,
it is evident that the PVDF-mediated fluorination of the perovskite
BBO film proceeded reductively and yielded a cation-ordered fluoride
Ba0.5Bi0.53+F2.5, rather
than an oxyfluoride.

Figure 3b
shows
a two-dimensional 2θ–γ image around the STO 110
diffraction pattern of the BBF film fluorinated at Tf = 200 °C for 24 h. The BBF 111 diffraction located
at 2θ = 25.6° was clearly observed as a broad peak along
the γ-direction, as shown in Figure 3c. The FWHM value of the peak (3.3°)
was much larger than that of the BBO precursor film (0.73°),
suggesting that a part of the BBF film was not oriented to the out-of-plane
direction. Both a- and c-axis lengths
of the BBF film were calculated to be 0.602 nm, which are close to
the lattice parameter of bulk polycrystalline Ba0.55Bi0.45F2.45.33

The
PVDF-mediated fluorination reaction of the BBO film is schematically
illustrated in Figure 4. The [100] direction of the perovskite BBO film corresponds to the
[110] direction of the fluorite BBF film. Note that the length of aBBF/√2 of the BBF film (0.426 nm) was
shorter than the aBBO axis length of the
BBO precursor film (0.434 nm). This suggests that lattice defects
were introduced in the film, resulting in an increase in the FWHM
value of the BBF 111 peak. The film drastically changed color from
black to fully transparent after fluorination, implying that the band
gap of the film increased with fluorination.

Figure 4 Schematic diagram of
the change in crystal structural of BBO films
with PVDF-mediated fluorination.

Next, we argue the effect of Tf on
the PVDF-mediated fluorination. Figure 5 shows the 2θ–θ XRD patterns of
the BBO precursor film and the films obtained by fluorination at Tf = 100–450 °C for 24 h. The film
reacted with PVDF at Tf = 100 °C
showed diffraction peaks from both perovskite BBO (001, 002, and 003)
and fluorite BBF (001 and 002) due to the coexistence of unreacted
BBO and fluorinated phase in the film. At Tf = 150–200 °C, the peaks from BBO disappeared, whereas
the BBF 001 peak emerged together with BBF 002l,
indicating the ordering of Ba and Bi in the fluorite structure. The
001 superlattice peak remained intact even when the reaction time
was increased to 48 h at Tf = 200 °C
(Figure S2 in the Supporting Information)
but disappeared above Tf = 250 °C,
indicating full cation disorder. Above Tf = 350 °C, the film partially decomposed into BaF2 and BiF3.

Figure 5 2θ–θ XRD patterns of the BBO precursor
film
and films obtained by fluorination at Tf = 100–450 °C for 24 h.

The Ba/Bi ordering ratio S can be written
using
the intensity of the XRD peaks as follows 1  where (I001/I002)measured and (I001/I002)fully ordered are the intensity ratios of the 001
superstructure peak to the 002
fundamental peak obtained from the measured and fully ordered XRD
patterns, respectively. The fully ordered XRD patterns were simulated
using VESTA software.35 The S values of the BBF films fluorinated at Tf = 150 and 200 °C for 24 h were estimated to be ∼70 and
∼64%, respectively. Therefore, at moderately low temperatures
(150–200 °C), the PVDF-mediated fluorination of BBO films
mainly proceeds in a topotactic manner, i.e., both insertion of F– ions and removal of O2– ions occur,
maintaining the cation positions during the PVDF reaction. On the
other hand, at relatively high temperatures (250–300 °C),
the cations are fully disordered. These results imply that the cation
ordering in the BBF films can be controlled by the reaction temperature
with PVDF.

4 Conclusions
Fluorite-type fluoride
BBF thin films were obtained by PVDF-mediated
fluorination of perovskite-type BBO as a precursor. The fluorination
reaction proceeded completely, accompanied by reduction of the Bi
valence from +3/+5 in BBO to +3 in BBF. The BBF films synthesized
at moderately low reaction temperatures of 150–200 °C
exhibited Ba/Bi ordering in the [001] direction, whereas Ba and Bi
ions were fully disordered in the films prepared at 250–300
°C. This demonstrates that the degree of the Ba/Bi cation ordering
in the [001] direction could be controlled by adjusting the fluorination
temperature. PVDF-mediated fluorination of BBO could provide a new
route to synthesize BBF with controlled cation order/disorder. Future
research could examine the effect of cation ordering on the fluoride
ion conductivity in BBF.
