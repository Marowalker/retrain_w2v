Introduction
Coordination polymers
(CPs) have attracted the interest of coordination
chemists for the last few years for their application in gas absorption,
magnetic material, catalysis, luminescence, drug delivery, sensor
technology, etc.1,2 Although application of some organic
materials in light-emitting diodes3 and
field effect transistors4 is known, fabrication
of an active electronic device using CPs is not well explored till
date. Some d10 metals have the ability to increase the
intensity and shift the wavelength of emission of organic ligands
by metal coordination, and therefore d10 metal-based CPs
were used in optoelectronic devices.5 There
are reports in the literature regarding the fascinating application
of some semiconducting CPs in photovoltaics6 and other optoelectronic devices.7 N2O2O2′ donor compartmental Schiff
base ligands have been widely used for the preparation of hetero-dinuclear
complexes.8 These could then be linked
using suitable pseudohalides [NCS–, N3–, NCO–, and N(CN)2–] to generate various CPs.9 Although any member of the first transition series is a good choice
to be placed in the inner N2O2 compartment of
such ligands, nickel(II) is preferred for its ability and flexibility
to bind both hard and soft donor centers with equal ease and to adopt
varieties of geometries with different coordination numbers, oxidation
states, and its applicability extending from organometallic to biological
chemistry.10 On the other hand, the coordination
chemistry of lead(II) is also interesting for its potential to form
hemi- as well as holo-directed complexes with coordination numbers
ranging from 2 to 10.11 However, it must
be remembered that lead is hazardous to pollution and health12 and must be handled with great care. Any semiconducting
material showing rectifying nature in a metal–semiconductor
(MS) junction can be applied in the Schottky device.13 The nonlinear rectifying behavior of I–V characteristics of that material-based
device measured under dark and illumination conditions proves its
photosensitive Schottky diode character.14 However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no report in the
literature to use any X-ray characterized hetero-bimetallic CP for
the fabrication of any optoelectronic devices till date. In this work,
a compartmental Schiff base ligand has been used to synthesize a nickel(II)
complex, which could then be used as a metalloligand to prepare a
hetero-bimetallic nickel(II)/lead(II) building block, which in turn,
is linked via thiocyanate to form a coordination polymer (Scheme 1). The band gap (3.18
eV) has been calculated from Tauc’s plot, and it suggests the
semiconducting nature of the complex. The rectifying nature in I–V characteristics hints toward
its Schottky diode characteristics. The on–off ratio (70) of
the semiconductor device fabricated with CP is high. This is eventually
the first report of any hetero-bimetallic coordination polymer with
photosensitivity, which could be used in the fabrication of a Schottky
diode.

Experimental Section
Nickel(II) thiocyanate tetrahydrate has been prepared by us following
the literature method.15 Other reagents
and solvents (AR grade) were used as procured from Sigma-Aldrich without
purification.

Synthesis
Synthesis of H2L [N,N′-Bis(3-methoxysalicylidene)propane-1,3-diamine]
3-Methoxysalicylaldehyde (304 mg, 2 mmol) and 1,3-diaminopropane
(0.13 mL, 1 mmol) were mixed in methanol (20 mL), and the mixture
was refluxed for ca. 1 h to prepare H2L via Schiff base
condensation. The ligand was not isolated and was used directly for
the synthesis of the complex in the next step.

Synthesis
of [(NCS)Pb(H2O)LNi(NCS)]n
A methanol (10 mL) solution of lead(II) nitrate
(332 mg, 1 mmol) was added to the methanol solution (20 mL) of H2L, and the resulting solution was stirred for 15 min. A methanol
(10 mL) solution of nickel(II) thiocyanate tetrahydrate (250 mg, 1
mmol) was then added to it, and the stirring was continued for about
2 h. X-ray quality crystalline complexes were obtained after 3–4
days on slow evaporation of the solution in open atmosphere. Suitable
single crystals were isolated from this product for X-ray diffraction
analysis.

Physical Measurements
C, H, and N analysis was performed
using a PerkinElmer 240C elemental analyzer. IR spectrum in KBr (4500–500
cm–1) was recorded with a PerkinElmer Spectrum Two
spectrophotometer. Electronic spectrum of the complex in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) was recorded on a PerkinElmer
Lambda 35 UV–visible spectrophotometer. Steady-state photoluminescence
spectrum of the complex in DMF was obtained in Shimadzu RF-5301PC
spectrofluorometer at room temperature. Time-dependent photoluminescence
spectrum was recorded using a Hamamatsu MCP photomultiplier (R3809)
and was analyzed by using IBHDAS6 software. X-ray diffraction of the
powdered sample was performed on a Bruker D8 instrument with Cu Kα
radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å).

X-ray Crystallography
A suitable single crystal of
the complex was picked and mounted on a glass fiber, and diffraction
intensities were measured with an Oxford Diffraction X-Calibur diffractometer
equipped with Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å, 50
kV, 40 mA) at 150 K. Data collection and reduction were performed
with the Crysalis software.16 The structure
of the complex was solved by direct methods using SHELXS-97 and refined
by full-matrix least squares on F2, using
the SHELXL-2016 program.17 Nonhydrogen
atoms were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms attached with oxygen
atoms were located by difference Fourier maps. All other hydrogen
atoms were placed in their geometrically idealized positions and constrained
to ride on their parent atoms. Programs used included PLATON,18 DIAMOND,19 ORTEP,20 and MERCURY.21

Device Fabrication
Electrical characterization was
performed in the complex-based metal–semiconductor (MS) junction
devices. These devices were fabricated by depositing a thin film of
a well-dispersed solution of the synthesized complex. To develop the
thin films, indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates were cleaned
by acetone, ethanol, and distilled water with the help of an ultrasonicator.
Thereafter, the complex was separately mixed with N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) in the right proportion
(20 mg mL–1) and sonicated for several minutes until
it produces a well-stabilized dispersion. Then, on the top of the
cleaned ITO-coated substrates, stable dispersion of the just prepared
complex was spun first at 600 rpm for 4 min and thereafter at 1000
rpm for 6 min with the help of SCU 2700 spin coating unit. To evaporate
the solvent, as-deposited thin films were annealed under vacuum at
80 °C for 30 min. For the characterization of the developed thin
film, thickness was measured by a surface profiler as ∼1 μm.
Pure Al (99.99%) was chosen as the metal electrode and was deposited
on to the active thin film to prepare the metal–semiconductor
(MS) interface through a shadow mask by thermal evaporation technique
with the help of a vacuum-coating unit under a base pressure of 10–6 Torr. The effective areas of the films were maintained
as 7.065 × 10–2 cm–2. For
electrical characterization of the devices, the current–voltage
(I–V) characteristics were
recorded under dark and AM 1.5G radiation with the help of a Keithley
2635B source meter by a two-probe technique. All preparation and measurements
were performed at room temperature and under ambient conditions.

Results and Discussion

H2L is a N2O2O2′ donor Schiff base ligand,
and it has been prepared

following the literature method.22 The
ligand (H2L) on reaction with lead(II) nitrate followed
by the addition of nickel(II) thiocyanate tetrahydrate formed the

The complex consists
of a chain system with the repeating hetero-dinuclear
neutral units, [(NCS)Pb(H2O)LNi(NCS)]n, joined through two μ1,3-thiocyanate bridge.
In each bimetallic unit, the nickel(II) and lead(II) centers, respectively,
occupy the inner N2O2 and outer O2O2′ sites of the potential N2O2O2′ donor deprotonated compartmental Schiff base,
L2–. A perspective view of the asymmetric unit of
the complex with selective atom numbering scheme is depicted in Figure 1. Both nickel(II)
and lead(II) have pseudo octahedral geometries. Ni(1) is coordinated
by two imine nitrogen atoms, N(19) and N(23), and two phenoxo oxygen
atoms, O(11) and O(31), of the deprotonated potential N2O2O2′ donor compartmental Schiff base
ligand (L)2–, which constitute the equatorial plane.
The deviation of the coordinating atoms N(19), N(23), O(11), and O(31)
from the least-square mean plane through them is −0.037(5),
0.038(5), 0.044(4), and −0.043(4) Å, respectively, and
that of Ni(1) from the same plane is 0.0025(7) Å. The fifth coordination
site is occupied by one nitrogen atom, N(2), from a thiocyanate anion.
A nitrogen atom, N(1)#, from a symmetry-related (1/2 – x, −1/2 + y, 1/2 – z) thiocyanate anion coordinates nickel(II) in its sixth
coordination site to form a distorted octahedron. On the other hand,
lead(II) is coordinated by two phenoxo oxygen atoms, O(11) and O(31),
and two ethoxy oxygen atoms, O(131) and O(291), which constitute the
equatorial plane. The fifth coordination site is occupied by an oxygen
atom, O(1), from a water molecule. A sulfur atom, S(1), from an end-to-end
bridged thiocyanate coordinates with lead(II) in its sixth coordination
site to complete its distorted octahedral geometry. Nickel(II) and
lead(II) centers are bridged by two phenoxo oxygen atoms, O(11) and
O(31), with Ni(1)···Pb(1) distance being 3.458(7) Å.
The bridging angles, Ni(1)–O(11)–Pb(1) and Ni(1)–O(31)–Pb(1),
are 104.5(2) and 105.3(2)°, respectively. The Ni(1)–O(11)–O(31)–Pb(1)
core is almost planar (the dihedral angle is close to ∼5.32°).

Supramolecular Interaction
The complex forms an interesting
supramolecular structure via π···π interactions.
π···π interactions have been observed between
the phenyl ring C(12)–C(13)–C(14)–C(15)–C(16)–C(17)
and symmetry-related (−x, −y, −z) phenyl ring C(12)–C(13)–C(14)–C(15)–C(16)–C(17).
These interactions form a two-dimensional (2D) structure (Figure 2). Details of the
geometric features of π···π interactions
have been given in Table 3.

Morphological
Analysis
Microstructure of the complex
has been studied by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM)
and presented in Figure 3. The micrograph states featherlike morphology of the complex.

Optical Analysis
The Tauc plot (the details have been
given in the Supporting Information) of
the material has been presented in Figure 4. From Tauc’s plot, the direct energy
band gap (Eg) of the material has been
estimated as 3.18 eV by measuring the x-intercept
of the extrapolated linear part of the plot (αhν)2 vs (hν). The analysis
for taking direct band gap has been provided in the Supporting Information.

and Tauc’s plot
for the complex.

As the band gap suggests
that the complex is semiconducting in
nature, there is a possibility to apply the complex in a semiconducting
device. But there has always been technological difficulty in application
of these materials in active devices. Thus, to check the possibility
of device application, fabrication of a metal–semiconductor-based
thin-film Schottky diode has been tried. As the electronic charge
transport properties determine the performance of the devices, it
is very important to analyze charge transport properties in detail.

Electrical Characterization
The current–voltage
(I–V) measurements of the
device [schematic diagram (Figure S2) has
been given in the Supporting Information] fabricated with CP have
been done in dark and under AM 1.5G light illumination in the voltage
range of −2 to +2 V. Experimentally obtained I–V curves of the device under dark and illumination
are shown in Figure 5. The inset in Figure 5 represents the curve in log scale.

Figure 5 Current–voltage characteristics
curve in dark and under
light.

The nonlinear I–V curve
of the device under both the conditions indicates that the fabricated
metal–semiconductor junction is a Schottky junction. From the I–V curve, rectification ratios
have been calculated, which are 70 and 89 under dark and illumination
condition, respectively. This proves the successful application of
the complex material in an active electronic device. The estimated
conductivity of the thin film has been increased from 2.02 ×
10–4 S cm–1 under dark to 8.55
× 10–4 S cm–1 under light.
The conductivity data for the crystal has also been provided in the Supporting Information.

To assess the potentiality
of the fabricated device for application
in a photodetector, we have estimated important parameters like photosensitivity
(S = Iph/ID where Iph is the photocurrent
and ID is the dark current Idark), specific detectivity (D*), and
responsivity (R). Photosensitivity of our device
is 5.76, and this has been compared with the other reported devices
and presented in Table 4.23

Responsivity (R) of the device can be estimated
from the following equation  Here, A is the effective
area of the diode and Pin is the incident
power of the light. For our device, the responsivity is 1.69 A W–1, which is significant for this kind of device. The
specific detectivity (D*) has been estimated from
the equation  where q is the charge of
electron. The specific detectivity of the device has been estimated
as 6.55 × 1010 Jones, which is again significant.
All device parameters indicate that the fabricated device has a great
potential in the field of active electronic device.

Further
analysis of the different device parameters has been done
by thermionic emission theory given by the following equation  Here, the forward current is represented by I, reverse
saturation current by I0, V denotes the applied bias voltage, q is the electronic
charge, k represents
the Boltzmann constant, T gives the absolute temperature,
and n denotes the ideality factor (IF). I0 is expressed by  The effective

Cheung’s equations24 given below,
other different Schottky parameters have also
been calculated      Here, the series resistance is given by RS and all other notations are kept same.

The intercept of the dV/d ln I vs I plot shown in Figure 6 is used to estimate the ideality factor.
Determination of the barrier potential height and the series resistance
is done using the intercept and slope of H(I) vs I plot given in Figure 7. The various parameters calculated
are enlisted in Table 5.

The ideality factor should be unity,
but here it is less than 1,
which can be due to the presence of inhomogeneities at the Schottky
junction.25

For the assessment of
charge transport behavior of the device,
mobility and diffusion length of charge carriers are the two important
parameters. So the charge transport mechanism has been analyzed through
the metal–semiconductor contact. Here, we have estimated mobility
(μeff), lifetime (τ), carrier concentration
(N), and diffusion length (LD) by applying space charge limited current (SCLC) theory. Figure 8 shows the I–V curve in a double logarithmic
scale. The graph presented in Figure 8 can be divided into three regions with different slopes.
Region 1 (Reg 1), which represents the lower bias, follows ohmic nature
with current being directly proportional to voltage. The origin of
the current is from the bulk generated electrons of the film, rather
than the injected free carriers. Here, tunneling is the main contributing
factor that can be observed from the I–V curve.26

Figure 8 I vs V graph in double logarithmic
scale.

In Figure 8, the
slope of Reg 2 is increased compared with Reg 1. Within the material,
a part of the injected carriers is trapped within the traps present
and a part remains free. With the increase of applied voltage, traps
within the material are filled with a higher number of injected carriers.27 As the current increases rapidly, the Fermi
level (EF) moves through a trap level.28 The slope of this region increases sharply as
the traps are being filled up rapidly by the carriers. The second
region is known as the trap filling region.28 When almost all traps are filled, the slope of the third region
decreases as result of slower carrier movement. Here, current follows
the relationship I ∝ V2, which is the feature of trap-free space charge limited current
(SCLC) regime.27,28

So, effective carrier mobility
(μeff) has been
estimated from I vs V2 graph (Figure 9)
of the trap-free SCLC region using the Mott–Gurney equation29 given by  where I is the current, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is
the dielectric constant, and d is the thickness of
the film (about 1 μm).

Figure 9 I versus V2 plot under
dark and light.

There are few more important
charge transport parameters like carrier
concentration and transit time, which determine the device performance.
The carrier concentration (N), transit time (τ),
and diffusion length (LD) is estimated
with the following set of equations30    where D is the diffusion
coefficient. The diffusion coefficient has been calculated by employing
the Einstein–Smoluchowski equation31  By analyzing the charge transport parameters,
it is seen that the diffusion length and carrier mobility increased
and transit time decreased after light illumination, which indicates
that the device could be very useful for photosensitive device applications.

Conclusions
Although the nonlinear rectifying behavior of I–V characteristics of few semiconducting
material-based devices measured under dark and illumination conditions
proves their photosensitive Schottky diode character, there was no
report in the literature to use any X-ray-characterized hetero-bimetallic
coordination polymer for the fabrication of any optoelectronic device
before the present work. In this article, synthesis, X-ray structure,
and electronic properties of a hetero-bimetallic nickel(II)/lead(II)
CP has been described. The band gap (3.18 eV) of the material indicates
that it belongs to the semiconductor family. Intermolecular interactions
play a key role for molecular conductors and semiconductors. The present
complex forms a one-dimensional (supramolecular) structure via coordinate
bond. This coordinate bond formation helps the complex to show very
high conductivity. The complex has been successfully applied in technologically
challenging thin-film Schottky diodes with appraised different charge
transport and device related parameters. The results indicate that
the material can be applied to photosensitive active devices. The
preparation of the complex thus illustrates a potentially versatile
approach to the construction of hetero-bimetallic coordination polymers
and their potential application in the field of optoelectronics.

We are still working in the laboratory to get better yield of the
product and to develop and characterize more systems based on this
strategy to generalize the concept.
