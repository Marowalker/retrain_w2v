Formic acid and its salts are an
alternative source for hydrogen
generation. In this study, we store hydrogen using the formate–bicarbonate
cycle. Aqueous sodium bicarbonate is hydrogenated to form sodium formate,
which can then be decomposed to release hydrogen and sodium bicarbonate.
The hydrogenation step is carried out under mild conditions in the
presence of a homogeneous ruthenium catalyst. Hydrogen charge is realized
at 70 °C under a hydrogen pressure of 20 bar, achieving yields
> 80% and turnover number > 610. The catalyst is stable and
robust
through numerous cycles of the hydrogenation reaction. The formate
ion formed during the bicarbonate hydrogenation is assayed and quantified
by ion chromatography.

==== Body
Introduction
Formic
acid contains only 4.4% w/w of hydrogen; however, it appeals
to scientists as a hydrogen carrier due to the simplicity of the decomposition
reaction and the potential reversibility of the process to store hydrogen.
The process for generating formic acid from hydrogen and carbon dioxide
is an uphill reaction and requires a catalyst. 1  The degree
of catalyst activity in the reaction
is expressed by two indices: turnover number (TON), which describes
the moles of desired product per mole of the homogeneous catalyst,
and the turnover frequency (TOF), which describes the rate of the
catalytic reaction and is dependent on the TON. Actually, TOF is the
moles of product per mole of the catalyst per unit time and its value
is usually expressed in h–1.

The following
summary of the literature begins with hydrogenation
processes conducted by ruthenium catalysts on carbon dioxide alone
producing formic acid initially, and the same substance in the presence
of amines generating organic formate ions. Afterward, the carbon dioxide
hydrogenation processes producing inorganic formate ions are presented,
and finally, the hydrogenation reactions, which were carried out by
using bicarbonate ions, are shown.

Several researchers have
explored the formation of formic acid
with homogeneous catalysts. The prominent metal catalyst for the above
homogeneous reaction is ruthenium.1 Laurenczy
and co-workers investigated the ruthenium complex carrying a phosphorous
ligand 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane (PTA), RuCl2(PTA)4, and achieved a total TON of 749 for four catalytic cycles
at 60 °C. The reaction was run for 120 h under 100 bar of hydrogen
and carbon dioxide mixture. The concentration of the formic acid produced
was 1.8 M after the first and third cycles, 2.1 M after the second
cycle, and 1.9 M after the fourth cycle.2

Since the reaction described by eq 1 is technically very challenging, most studies
prefer
to start with formate salts in a basic environment, which was acidified
later on to yield formic acid.3 A ruthenium
complex containing a trimethylphosphine ligand, RuH2(P(CH3)3)4, was developed by Jessop et al.
for the hydrogenation reaction of supercritical carbon dioxide. Under
conditions of a total pressure of 205 bar in the presence of triethyl
amine (NEt3) at 50 °C, TOF = 1400 h–1 was realized with this catalyst.4 Another
ruthenium derivative carrying the same phosphine ligand was disclosed
by Munshi and co-workers. The catalyst, RuCl(OAc)(PMe3)4, was active in the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide and achieved
a TOF of 95 000 h–1 at 50 °C under a
hydrogen pressure of 70 bar and a carbon dioxide pressure of 120 bar.
Additives such as NEt3 and C6F5OH
were also included in the reaction mixture.5 In another study, Zhang’s team found that the carbon dioxide
hydrogenation reaction in the presence of RuCl3 and triphenylphosphine
generated the catalyst form RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3. NEt3 is required for the reaction to occur. The
results were TON = 200.1 after 5 h at 60 °C and a pressure of
60 bar of the carbon dioxide and hydrogen mixture.6 The pyridinyltriazolato catalyst, chlorido[5-(pyridin-2-yl)-1,2,4-triazolato]tris(trimethylphosphine)ruthenium(II),
was synthesized for the same goal by Muller and colleagues. The conditions
for the hydrogenation reaction were 20 g of solid carbon dioxide with
70 bar of hydrogen and additives of C6H5OH and
1,8-diazabicyclo[5,4,0]undec-7-ene (DBU) as a base. The catalyst reached
TON = 4800 after 4 h.7 In another study,
it was found by Beller et al. that [RuCl2(benzene)]2 with phosphorous ligand bis(diphenylphosphino)methane (DPPM)
in the presence of NEt3 converts the gases under the same
pressure of 60 bar to formate salt with TON = 6442.8 Another ruthenium complex with a DPPM ligand was investigated
by Yap and colleagues. The results of the catalyst [Ru2(μ-CO)(CO)4(μ-dppm)2] were TON
= 2160 and TOF = 103 h–1. The conditions of the
reaction were a total pressure of 70 bar (the ratio of hydrogen to
carbon dioxide was 1:1), with a basic medium using NEt3 at room temperature.9 The meta-trisulfonated
triphenylphosphine ligand was found to be active in the presence of
ruthenium, NEt3, and an ionic liquid by Leitner’s
team. The latter system attained TOF = 1089 h–1 at
50 °C and a pressure of 50 bar for each gas.10 Several pincer compounds of ruthenium were also investigated.
Ru-PNP pincer was studied by Pidko and colleagues. The latter generated
formate salt in the presence of dimethylformamide and DBU. TOF = 1 100 000
h–1 was measured at 120 °C and a total pressure
of 40 bar (H2/CO2 = 30:10).11 Another ruthenium pincer complex with a PNN ligand was
developed by Sanford’s team. The reaction for generating the
inorganic formate salt used hydrogen and carbon dioxide in a pressure
ratio of 30:10 (a total pressure of 40 bar) with potassium carbonate
achieving TON = 23 000 after 48 h at 200 °C.12 A tetrafluoroborate salt of ruthenium was also
studied in the formation of organic formic acid derivatives. The catalyst
[(η6MeC6H4Pri)Ru(η2-NC9H6O)(OH2)][BF4] promoted the reaction at 50 bar of carbon
dioxide and 50 bar of hydrogen in the presence of NEt3,
generating formate salt with TON = 400 after 10 h at 100 °C.13 Finally, a ruthenium complex with a N-heterocyclic
carbene ligand was also studied in the carbon dioxide hydrogenation
process. The reaction reached TON = 23 000 after 75 h at 200
°C and a hydrogen pressure of 20 bar and the same for carbon
dioxide. Potassium hydroxide functioned as a base in this reaction.14 The inorganic formate salts are preferable over
the amine-formate compounds as the hydrogen weight capacity of the
product is higher and the separation process is simpler.

When
decomposing formic acid, as was previously reported also by
our group,15 it is necessary to separate
the carbon dioxide from the gas stream for most of the applications
of the hydrogen product, such as fuel cells. For separating the carbon
dioxide and using it as a storage material, scientists have investigated
pathways for converting it to substrates such as bicarbonate salts,
which can react with hydrogen. The hydrogenation process of bicarbonate
salts instead of carbon dioxide is known as an alternative way for
formate generation.16 The reaction is shown
in eq 2. 2  The hydrogenation reaction of sodium bicarbonate
at 70 °C under a pressure of 80 bar was performed by Beller and
colleagues. The latter achieved TON = 1108 after 20 h in the presence
of [RuCl2(benzene)]2 and the phosphorous ligand
DPPM.17 The aforementioned catalyst and
ligand achieved TON = 2793 after 20 h at 100 °C in the presence
of hydrogen at a pressure of 50 bar and sodium bicarbonate solution.
Carbon dioxide at a pressure of 35 bar was also added to the reaction
vessel.18 In addition, a ruthenium complex
including the sulfonated ligand 3-sulfonyldiphenylphosphine (mTPPMS) aided the generation of formate with a high pressure
(95 bar) of hydrogen, achieving TOF = 9600 h–1 at
80 °C.19 A ruthenium complex with
a N-heterocyclic carbene ligand was also studied in the bicarbonate
hydrogenation process. The reaction reached TON = 1200 after 24 h
at 100 °C and a hydrogen pressure of 50 bar. The conversion was
62%.20 Olah et al. discovered the ruthenium
compound carbonylhydrido(tetrahydroborato)[bis(2-diphenylphosphinoethyl)amino]ruthenium(II),
which achieved TOF > 2000 h–1 in the potassium
bicarbonate
hydrogenation process after less than 0.5 h at 70 °C and a pressure
of 40 bar of hydrogen. The formate yield was 75%.21 Chatterjee’s team investigated a ruthenium complex
with the ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) ligand. The hydrogenation
of bicarbonate with the RuIII(edta) catalyst reached a
yield of 46% for formate ion and TON = 46. The reaction conditions
were a hydrogen pressure of 8 bar and a temperature of 40 °C.22

In most of the above studies, scientists
generated organic formic
acid salts by using amines such as NEt3 or DBU as a base.
The usage of amines has several drawbacks: They reduce the hydrogen
weight capacity of the formate salts and the separation from the catalyst
solution is complicated. Herein, we report some new findings regarding
the ruthenium MACHO (which is a pincer compound)-catalyzed formate
generation process via the hydrogenation of sodium bicarbonate under
ambient conditions.

Results and Discussion
The catalyst
Ru-MACHO (Figure 1) was
developed by Kuriyama and co-workers for
the hydrogenation of esters.23 The same
catalyst was studied by Beller and his team for the hydrogenation
process of sodium bicarbonate at a hydrogen pressure of 10 bar achieving
TON = 1420 at 100 °C after 20 h.24 We examined the Ru-MACHO complex in the formate generation reaction.
The catalyst solution in isopropanol was mixed with an aqueous solution
of sodium bicarbonate and was placed in an autoclave. The reaction
took place at 70 °C under a hydrogen pressure of 20 bar. The
pressure in the autoclave was monitored, and the acquired kinetic
graph is shown in Figure 2. The kinetic profile shown in Figure 2 describes a typical second-order behavior.

with Ru-MACHO catalyst. The catalyst 30.64 μmol Ru-MACHO dissolved
in 25 mL of isopropanol, 24.43 mmol sodium bicarbonate, and 25 mL
of H2O were heated to 70 °C for 1 h. Then, 22.2 bar
hydrogen was introduced to the autoclave.

The yield of the product was 67–79% with a
relative standard
deviation of 0.16–1.01%.

It was found that both isopropanol
and H2O are crucial
for the hydrogenation reaction to take place. The absence of solvent
or distilled water prevents the reaction from occurring. The catalyst
concentration had a critical effect on the reaction rate, i.e., as
the number of moles of the catalyst increases, the yield increases.
Nevertheless, the TON and TOF values decrease significantly. Influence
of number of moles of the catalyst, solvent, and additive on the hydrogenation
process is presented in Table 1.

We observed that the catalyst
starts with a nonclear white solution,
which changes during the reaction to a clear pink solution (Figure 3).

One of our
objectives in this study is to demonstrate the stability
of the catalyst and its ability to function for successive batches
without diminishing its activity. Because the concentration of sodium
formate that can be quantified by ion chromatography measurement is
limited to about 50 ppm, for preparing the same quantities when sampling
the product (30 μL of sample was diluted to 100 mL), we investigated
the hydrogenation reaction with half of the mass of sodium bicarbonate.
The yield of the reaction in one cycle was 78–85% with a relative
standard deviation of 0.21–2.14%.

The catalyst was studied
for several consecutive runs. In the first
cycle, the catalyst, the solvents (isopropanol and distilled water),
and sodium bicarbonate were introduced to the autoclave. After washing
three times under nitrogen gas and heating to 70 °C, hydrogen
was poured into the autoclave. When the hydrogenation process is complete,
the autoclave was cooled to room temperature and the hydrogen gas
was released. The autoclave was washed with nitrogen and “rested”
overnight. The procedure for the other runs consisted of loading the
autoclave with isopropanol, distilled water, and the substrate sodium
bicarbonate, washing three times under nitrogen gas, and heating to
70 °C. Finally, hydrogen was poured in and the reaction took
place until completion. Every cycle was cooled to room temperature,
washed with nitrogen, and “rested” overnight. The calculations
of the conversions and the TONs included the evidence of the diluting
of the catalytic mixture after every cycle. It was found that the
conversion achieved in four runs was between 65 and 82% and that the
catalytic activity was stable through four cycles (Figure 4).

the hydrogenation process of sodium bicarbonate

Figure 4 Conversion of sodium formate generated during the bicarbonate
hydrogenation
reaction with Ru-MACHO catalyst. The catalyst 30.48 μmol Ru-MACHO
was dissolved in 25 mL of isopropanol, and 24.62 mmol sodium bicarbonate
was added with 25 mL of distilled water. The mixture was heated to
70 °C for 1 h, 23 bar of hydrogen was added to the autoclave,
and the reaction started immediately. For subsequent batches, 5 mL
of isopropanol and 5 mL of distilled water with the new amount of
sodium bicarbonate (24.57–24.61 mmol) were added. The hydrogenation
process took place under 22.9–23.1 bar of hydrogen.

Conclusions
A homogeneous ruthenium(II)
catalyst was developed for the generation
of sodium formate from sodium bicarbonate under mild conditions. The
catalytic mixture changes color from a nontransparent white to a clear
pink during the process. The catalyst formed in this manner was realized
as exceptionally stable even after an overnight rest period at room
temperature between the cycles after releasing the hydrogen gas and
washing with nitrogen. Its activity was preserved for four cycles
under ambient conditions, and it could be reactivated again and again
simply by the addition of sodium bicarbonate and heating to 70 °C.
At this temperature, TON > 610 was measured for each cycle.

The kinetics of the reaction was measured using an autoclave connected
to a computer, and the quantification of the formate anion was done
by ion chromatography measurement. Without doubt, the environmentally
friendly hydrogenation reaction presented in this paper is appropriate
as a hydrogen store in applications such as fuel cells.

Experimental
Section
Materials
The catalyst Ru-MACHO and sodium bicarbonate
(anhydrous, ≥99.7%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The
solvent isopropanol (CMOS grade) was purchased from J. T. Baker, and
the hydrogen cylinder (99.999%) was acquired from Moshalion Jerusalem
Oxygen LTD.

Instruments
The reaction took place
in an autoclave
high-pressure Parr 4848 series reactor (290 mL) monitored by the SpecView32
software.

The identification and quantification of the formate
ion generated during the hydrogenation process was carried out by
ion chromatography-Dionex LC20 Chromatography Enclosure with a precolumn
Dionex IonPac AG14, RFIC 4 × 50 mm Guard (Thermo), and a column
Dionex IonPac AS14 RFIC 4 × 250 mm Analytical (Thermo).

Typical
Recursive Procedure for the Hydrogenation Process of
Sodium Bicarbonate
A solution of Ru-MACHO (18.5 mg, 30.48
μmol) and isopropanol (25 mL) was placed in an autoclave. Then,
sodium bicarbonate (2.0681 g, 24.62 mmol) and distilled water (25
mL) were added. The autoclave was washed with nitrogen three times,
and the temperature was raised to 70 °C for 1 h. Afterward, the
pressure was released, hydrogen (23.0 bar) was added to the autoclave,
and the monitoring system was started. Every 2 s, values of temperature
and pressure were measured and recorded. After the system reached
equilibrium, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature and the
gas was slowly released. A conversion of 79% and TON = 638 after 7.5
h were calculated by ion chromatography apparatus. The system was
washed with nitrogen once and stored with 5.0 bar of nitrogen at room
temperature overnight.

The second cycle was started by adding
isopropanol (5 mL), sodium bicarbonate (2.0645 g, 24.57 mmol), and
distilled water (5 mL) to the autoclave. The autoclave was washed
with nitrogen three times, and the temperature was raised to 70 °C
for 1 h. Afterward, the pressure was released, hydrogen (23.0 bar)
was added to the autoclave, and the monitoring system was started.
After the system reached equilibrium, the autoclave was cooled to
room temperature and the gas was slowly released. A conversion of
65% and TON = 640 after 7.5 h were calculated by ion chromatography
apparatus. The system was washed with nitrogen once and stored with
5.3 bar of nitrogen at room temperature overnight.

The third
cycle was started by adding isopropanol (5 mL), sodium
bicarbonate (2.0675 g, 24.61 mmol), and distilled water (5 mL) to
the autoclave. The autoclave was washed with nitrogen three times,
and the temperature was raised to 70 °C for 1 h. Afterward, the
pressure was released, hydrogen (22.9 bar) was added to the autoclave,
and the monitoring system was started. After the system reached equilibrium,
the autoclave was cooled to room temperature and the gas was slowly
released. A conversion of 65% and TON = 811 after 7.5 h were calculated
by ion chromatography apparatus.
