Ag10c is a recently reported RNA-cleaving
DNAzyme obtained from
in vitro selection. Its cleavage activity selectively requires Ag+ ions, and thus it has been used as a sensor for Ag+ detection. However, the previous selection yielded very limited
information regarding its sequence requirement, since only ∼0.1%
of the population in the final library were related to Ag10c and most
other sequences were inactive. In this work, we performed a reselection
by randomizing the 19 important nucleotides in Ag10c in such a way
that a purine has an equal chance of being A or G, whereas a pyrimidine
has an equal chance of being T or C. The round 3 library of the reselection
was carefully analyzed and a statistic understanding of the relative
importance of each nucleotide was obtained. At the same time, a more
active mutant was identified, containing two mutated nucleotides.
Further analysis indicated new base pairs leading to an enzyme with
smaller catalytic loops but with ∼200% activity of the original
Ag10c, and also excellent selectivity for Ag+. Therefore,
a more active mutant of Ag10c was obtained and further truncations
were successfully performed, which might be better candidates for
developing new biosensors for silver. A deeper biochemical understanding
was also obtained using this reselection method.

==== Body
Introduction
Silver is an important
metal for technology, but it is also a heavy
metal contaminant in the environment.1 Ag+ has very interesting roles in interacting with nucleic acids.
The most well-known example is the specific binding of Ag+ by cytosine forming a C–Ag+–C base pair.2,3 In fact, Ag+ can bind to all of the DNA bases, and DNA
is a popular template for preparing fluorescent silver nanoclusters.4,5

Although this simple C–Ag+–C interaction
allowed rational design of silver-binding DNAs, we are interested
in exploring other binding mechanisms, which may have even better
specificity. In general, aptamer selections have been performed for
various metal ions.6−9 However, few high-quality aptamers are available for metal binding.
Another method is to select DNA based on catalytic activity. Catalytically
active DNA sequences are called DNAzymes,10−14 and the most extensively studied DNAzymes perform
the RNA cleavage reaction.10,11,15−17 Interestingly, most DNAzymes require metal ions for
activity.18,19 Using DNAzymes, many metal ions can be detected
with excellent sensitivity and specificity,20−22 such as Na+,23−26 Ca2+,27,28 Pb2+,29 Zn2+,30−32 UO22+,33 Hg2+,34 Cd2+,35 Cu2+,36 and trivalent lanthanides.37,38 We recently used Ag+ for selection and obtained a highly
Ag+-specific DNAzyme named Ag10c.39

Selection of unmodified DNAzymes for strongly thiophilic metals
has been quite challenging. Normally modified bases,30,34 or modified phosphate backbones, were needed.35,36 This can be attributed to the poor interactions between the DNA
phosphate and thiophilic metals,18,40 yet such interactions
are critical for the RNA cleavage reaction. At the same time, strong
interactions between DNA bases and thiophilic metals can lead to DNA
misfolding,41 which also hinders DNA selection.
Interestingly, the Ag10c DNAzyme did not contain any modification,
but our final selection library had very poor activity.39 The success of our previous selection was largely
due to the deep sequencing technology, allowing us to identify a very
small fraction of active sequences (∼0.1%).

With this
single active sequence, the information on its conserved
nucleotides is limited.42 We have made
some rational single-nucleotide mutations, but none of the mutants
worked better than the original Ag10c.43 We suspect that there might be more active mutants that require
mutation of multiple nucleotides at the same time, but this can hardly
be achieved by rational mutations. Herein, we performed a reselection
experiment by partially randomizing the Ag10c sequence. Indeed, we
found a more active mutant containing multiple mutations, and this
has led to a smaller catalytic core and deeper insights into this
DNAzyme.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals
The DNA samples were purchased
from Integrated
DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) and Eurofins (Huntsville, AL). AgNO3 and other metal salts were from Sigma-Aldrich at the highest
available purity. Sodium acetate, sodium chloride, ammonium acetate,
tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris), 2-(N-morpholino)-ethanesulfonic
acid (MES), 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid,
and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) disodium salt dihydrate
were from Mandel Scientific Inc. (Guelph, Ontario, Canada). Agarose
M, urea, 40% acryl/bis solution (29:1), and 10× Tris–borate–EDTA
were from Bio Basic (Markham, Ontario, Canada). Sso Fast EvaGreen
supermix was from Bio-Rad. T4-DNA ligase, deoxynucleotide (dNTP) mix,
gel loading dye (6×), Taq DNA polymerase, and low-molecular-weight
DNA ladder were from New England Biolabs.

In Vitro Selection
The selection was carried out according
to our previous report with some minor modifications.39 Briefly, the initial library was synthesized by ligating
Lib-FAM with Lib-rA in the presence of the splint DNA (see Table 1 for DNA sequences).
For the cleavage reaction, a final Ag+ concentration of
10 μM was added to the DNA library in buffer A (50 mM MES, pH
6.0, 50 mM NaNO3) with 60 min of incubation at room temperature.
Then, the reaction was terminated by 8 M urea and purified with 10%
denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (dPAGE). The position
corresponding to the cleavage product was excised from the gel. The
DNA was extracted with buffer B (1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris–HCl,
pH 7.0), and further purified with a Sep-Pak C18 column (Waters).
After drying in an Eppendorf vacufuge at 30 °C overnight, the
dried DNA was re-suspended in 50 μL of Milli-Q water. A small
fraction of this DNA was amplified by two polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) steps using previously described thermocycling protocols.

Sequencing
Prior
to deep sequencing, the round 3 and
round 4 libraries and the naive library before selection were subjected
to PCR1, as described above. The library from this step was subjected
to another PCR using the forward primer (P701) and the reverse primer
(P501), each containing a unique index sequence (see Table 1). The PCR products were purified
with 2% agarose gel and extracted using a gel extraction kit (IBI
Scientific). The extracted DNAs were eluted in 30 μL of Milli-Q
water, and their concentrations were quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer
to be between 10 and 20 ng/μL. The sequencing was performed
at the McMaster Genomics Facility (Hamilton, ON).

Activity Assay
For cleavage activity assays, a final
of 10 μM metal ions were incubated with 0.5 μM DNAzyme
complex in buffer A for 60 min (unless noted otherwise) at room temperature.
The complex was formed by annealing the FAM-substrate (see Table 1) and the enzyme in
buffer A. The reaction was quenched with 8 M urea and separated on
a 15% dPAGE at 120 V for 80 min. The gel bands were quantified with
a ChemiDoc MP imaging system (Bio-Rad).

Results and Discussion
Reselection
The structure of the Ag10c DNAzyme is shown
in Figure 1A.39,43 Its substrate strand has a single RNA linkage (rA for ribo-adenine)
serving as the cleavage site, whereas its enzyme strand has a hairpin
with two single-stranded bulges. The important nucleotides for Ag+ recognition are in these bulges,43 and these nucleotides were numbered. For our original selection,
we obtained only around 50 copies of Ag10c out of the 50 000
total sequences obtained.39 Most of the
other tested sequences were inactive. Therefore, the information from
the original selection regarding conserved nucleotides was quite limited.

Figure 1 (A) Secondary
structure of the Ag10c DNAzyme. The important nucleotides
in the enzyme strand are numbered and these 19 nucleotides are randomized
in the reselection. (B) Scheme of the reselection with five main steps.
After incubating the library with Ag+, the cleaved sequences
were harvested after gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and the full-length
library was regenerated by two steps of PCR. The P4 primer contained
a polymer spacer (the black diamond) that stops the polymerase, producing
two strands of DNA of unequal lengths for subsequent separation of
the active strand.

On the basis of the previous
biochemical assays, these two bulges
can tolerate certain mutations, mainly purine-to-purine and pyrimidine-to-pyrimidine
mutations.43 However, none of the mutants
were better than the wild-type Ag10c. Although these studies provided
some insights into silver binding, the information from single mutations
was still limited. If more active double or triple mutations exist,
the individual point mutation studies would miss them.

To address
this problem, we decided to partially randomize the
library to perform a reselection. We kept the overall secondary structure
of Ag10c and made changes only to the 19 important nucleotides (numbered
in Figure 1A). In addition
to the 17 in the loop, two more were also included (18 and 19) to
increase flexibility near the cleavage site. If an original base is
a G or A, in the reselection library, it had 50% chance of being G
and 50% being A. The same was applied to the pyrimidines, where C
and T were randomized to C/T with an equal possibility. We kept the
hairpin to force the library to fold into such a secondary structure.
As base pairs are formed between purines and pyrimidines, such a library
design may offer insights into some base pairing interactions that
were previously overlooked.

The reselection was performed as
schematically drawn in Figure 1B. After incubating
with Ag+ for the cleavage reaction, the library was loaded
into a gel, and the cleaved sequences (74-nucleotide) were harvested
and amplified by two steps of PCR to go back to the original library
for the next round of selection.39 We observed
a steady growth of the cleavage yield in the first three rounds (Figure 2A), whereas little
further increase was observed in round 4. Since a goal of the reselection
was to study the sequence requirement for activity, we hoped to retain
a high diversity of the library. Therefore, we stopped at round 4
and sequenced the naive library as well as the round 3 and 4 libraries.

of each round. (B) Sequence distribution in round 3 and 4 libraries

with a gray background. The copy number of each sequence is marked
at the end. The underlined sequences are the same for AgB0 and NaA43
(the first two sequences).

Sequence Analysis
The sequences were aligned using
the Geneious software, and the most populated 100 families were examined
in detail. For the round 4 library, about 85% of the sequences were
a single motif, and we named it AgB0 (Figure 2B, red bars). A careful analysis of AgB0
indicated that it is similar to the Na+-specific NaA43
DNAzyme (Figure 2C,
the first two rows),23 and also to a DNAzyme
reported by us in another work.26 NaA43
is active in the presence of Na+ alone, and it is not surprising
that we also obtained similar sequences, since we also had Na+ in our buffer. Selection of recurring sequences is quite
common for in vitro selection,44 and one
of the well-known examples is the 8–17 motif that has been
commonly seen in divalent-metal-dependent selections.31,45−48 Here, we used monovalent metals to avoid the 8–17,49 but the NaA43 appeared to be another such sequence.
As the round 4 library was dominated by AgB0, we did not study it
further.

We then turned our attention to the round 3 library,
which contained a total of 105 sequences. Indeed, both
the expected Ag10c-like sequences (AgB1 to AgB10 in Figure 2C), and also AgB0, were found.
We plotted the distribution of these sequences in Figure 2B (black bars). The disappearance
of Ag10c and growing of AgB0 were observed from round 3 to 4. We also
analyzed the naive library before selection, and the sequences were
random (data not shown).

As the round 3 library contained a
large fraction of Ag10c-like
sequences, we focused on it. In the round 3 library, we obtained 1341
of the original Ag10c sequence, which was about 1% of the total library.
In this work, our reselection library was specially designed. Normally,
reselection is performed by retaining 70% of the original base at
each position, while it has 10% possibility of being one of the other
three nucleotides. This way, it is expected that the majority of the
sequence is the original one. For 19 randomized bases, the original
sequence should be (0.7)19 = 0.11% of the
original library. In our case, we only made purine-to-purine and pyrimidine-to-pyrimidine
randomization, and the original Ag10c was only (0.5)19 = 0.00019% or 1.9 ppm of the original sequence. If the
library was not enriched, the Ag10c should only have 0.19 copy from
the 100 000 total DNA sequences. The fact that we had over
1000 copies of Ag10c indicated its selective enrichment, and it appeared
that the Ag10c is already an optimized DNAzyme.

Important Nucleotides
Aside from Ag10c, the next two
families (AgB1 and AgB2) each had over 1000 sequences, and they contained
two and three mutations, respectively. From AgB3 to AgB8, these sequences
had only single mutations. To have a full statistic understanding,
the distribution of each nucleotide in the final library was calculated,
which can give insights into the tolerance of each nucleotide to mutation
(Table 2). Some interesting observations were made. First,
most positions were dominated by one base (e.g., >95% possibility),
suggesting those positions do not tolerate purine–purine or
pyrimidine–pyrimidine mutations. A few positions, such as 5,
9, and 19, had ∼30% of chance of such mutation. One position
even had a few percent of pyrimidine-to-purine mutation (e.g., position
5). Therefore, these positions might not be important for catalysis.

Each Positiona

a The numbers in the table are the
percentage of each base at the designated position.

Positions 5 and 9 are close to the
hairpin, and it is easy to understand
that they might be unimportant. Position 19 is within the substrate-binding
arm. It has 71.3% chance of being an adenine, which can form a normal
base pair with the substrate region (Figure 1A). When it is a guanine (the rest 28.7%),
it can still form a wobble with the substrate. Interestingly, the
position 18 thymine was fully retained and no cytosine was detected
at this position. Therefore, its base pairing with the cleavage site
adenine might be critical for activity. Overall, this is a highly
conserved DNAzyme. The loop sequences from positions 1–4 and
10–18 are around 95% or higher conserved.

Activity Assays
The above sequence analysis was based
on statistics. To confirm the analysis, we then tested individual
DNAzyme sequences. Most of the sequences contained only single mutations,
and their activity has already been previously studied.43 Therefore, this work focused on sequences with
more than one mutation. Out of these aligned sequences, the first
two most abundant families are quite similar. AgB1 has two mutations
compared to Ag10c (namely T5C and A9G mutations). AgB2 has these same
two mutations and an additional one. This extra mutation did not seem
to be important, since it is in the substrate-binding arm. We measured
their activities using a FAM-labeled substrate (Figure 3A). Ag+-dependent cleavage was
observed from 5 to 20 μM of Ag+, and the yield appeared
to be even higher than that of the wild-type Ag10c (Figure 3C). The other sequences with
extensive mutations are AgB9 and AgB10. However, these two sequences
were inactive in the presence of Ag+ (Figure 3B). A key feature of the Ag10c
DNAzyme is its high selectivity for Ag+. Therefore, the
AgB1 mutant was also assayed with 27 monovalent, divalent, and trivalent
metal ions (Figure 3D), and only Ag+ produced cleavage. This reselected DNAzyme
also showed higher activity with a higher Na+ concentration,
and this property is unique to the Ag10c DNAzyme.43 Therefore, the reselected DNAzyme is likely to have the
same cleavage mechanism.

micrograph showing the cleavage with 10 μM metals.

Smaller but Faster DNAzyme
Because
AgB1 and AgB2 appeared
to be more active than Ag10c and they also retained excellent selectivity
for Ag+, we wanted to rationalize the improved activity.
These two sequences both contained T5C and A9G mutations. A careful
examination of the sequences revealed that very few sequences had
just one of these mutations, and this suggests that these two nucleotides
need to covariate. Therefore, we suspected that these two positions
might form a base pair (e.g., before mutation it forms an A–T
base pair, and after mutation it becomes a more stable G–C
pair, Figure 4A,B).
Considering its neighboring positions may also form a base pair (G6
and C8), we suspect these hypothetic base pairs could be part of the
hairpin with just an extra adenine (A7). To test this hypothesis,
we designed a sequence with the A7 deleted (Figure 4C).

cleavage of AgB1-del-A7 and Ag10c. Inset: A gel of AgB1 cleavage.
(H) Cleavage rates of a few DNAzymes with a further shortened hairpin.
The reaction was performed in pH 7.5 buffer with 10 μM Ag+ and 200 mM NaNO3.

We first compared the rate of DNAzyme cleavage. The AgB1-del-A7
was highly active (Figure 4D), and the cleavage appeared to reach saturation in 5 min.
Therefore, A7 can indeed be deleted. We then quantitatively fitted
the cleavage kinetics and a first-order rate of 0.80 min–1 was obtained for the AgB1-del-A7 (Figure 4E). For comparison, the original Ag10c was
only 0.38 min–1 under the same condition. Therefore,
we obtained a more active mutant through this reselection experiment.
A rate of 0.80 min–1 is the highest among RNA-cleaving
DNAzymes without a polyvalent metal ion. For comparison, the l-histidine-dependent DNAzyme (∼0.2 min–1 with 100 mM histidine),50 the NaA43 DNAzyme
(∼0.1 min–1 with 400 mM Na+),23 and the EtNa DNAzyme (∼0.1 min–1 with 2 M Na+) were all much slower.

After deleting
A7, two extra base pairs can nicely form, and the
true catalytic core region (e.g., the two loops) becomes smaller.
The right side of the loop has only T1 to G4, and the left side has
only G10 to G17. Therefore, we have reduced the core region by five
nucleotides. This will make it easier for subsequent biochemical and
biophysical studies. At the same time, the faster mutant will also
be analytically useful.

To further test our hypothesis, we deleted
C5, G6, C8, and G9 based
on AgB1-del-A7 and obtained a truncated DNAzyme named AgB1b (Figure 4E), which essentially
shortened the stem region by two base pairs. It is still quite active
with a rate of around 0.4 min–1 (Figure 4H, the red bar). This experiment
also confirmed that these four deleted bases did not participate in
the catalytic reaction, and they mainly function by base pairing.
We then further truncated the stem to leave only four base pairs (Figure 4F), and were finally
left with only eight bases for the whole hairpin (Figure 4G). In both cases, the activity
remained, although slightly lower than that of the original AgB1-del-A7
(Figure 4H). With these
truncations, we have significantly decreased the size of the DNAzyme,
and it will make further mechanistic and structural biology studies
easier.

Conclusions
In summary, on the basis
of the previously reported Ag10c DNAzyme,
we performed a reselection experiment with the intention to understand
its sequence requirement and to search for more active mutants. On
the basis of the reselection, we obtained a statistic understanding
of the importance of each nucleotide in the catalytic loop of Ag10c.
In particular, a co-variating double mutant was identified allowing
us to discover a new base paired region. On the basis of this understanding,
the enzyme activity improved by 1-fold and the sequence can also be
shortened significantly. This mutant could be a more active candidate
for further development of biosensors for Ag+. Our reselection
library contained only purine–purine and pyrimidine–pyrimidine
randomization, and this type of simple reselection library could be
a way to obtain interesting information. Such a reselection library
is cost-effective to synthesize, and it has provided interesting insights
about this Ag10c example to optimize its secondary structure. A future
step is to design a fully randomized library with each position mutated
to all four nucleotides based on this shortened DNAzyme. This two-step
reselection method may also be applicable to studies of other DNAzymes.
