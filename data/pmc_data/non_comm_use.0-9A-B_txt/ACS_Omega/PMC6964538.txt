Herein, we disclose Ru(II)-catalyzed regioselective distal
C(sp2)–H arylation of quinoline N-oxide
with arylboronic acids to 8-arylquinolines. In the developed method,
the Ru(II)-catalyst shows dual activity, that is, distal C–H
activation of quinoline N-oxides followed by in situ
deoxygenation of arylated quinoline N-oxide in the
same pot. The current catalytic method features use of Ru metal as
the catalyst and arylboronic acids as the arylating source under mild
reaction conditions. Use of the Rh(III)-catalyst in place of Ru(II)
under the same conditions afforded 8-arylquinoline N-oxides with excellent regioselectivity. Furthermore, the developed
Ru(II) catalytic system is also extended for the C(sp2)–H
arylation of indolines, N-tert-butylbenzamide,
and 6-(5H)-phenanthridinone. Formation of the quinoline N-oxide coordinated ruthenium adduct is found to be the
key reaction intermediate, which has been characterized by single
crystal X-ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy.

Introduction
N-heterocyclic aromatic scaffolds are
often encountered in a wide
range of compounds including natural products, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals,
and ligands.1 Quinoline, a prominent structural
scaffold, is found in a wide range of natural products and capable
of showing diverse type of therapeutic activity.2 Among them the 8-arylated quinoline moiety has its own
importance as it is often found in bioactive compounds (Scheme 1).3 Therefore, functionalization of the quinoline scaffold to corresponding
8-arylquinolines is highly desirable, in order to produce bioactive
compounds synthetically.

Scheme 1 Selected Example of Bioactive 8-Arylquinoline
Scaffolds
Transition metal-catalyzed regioselective C–H
functionalization
has emerged as an ideal strategy for the synthesis of therapeutically
active quinoline scaffolds.4 In this direction,
N-oxide has been explored as an excellent directing group for the
selective functionalization of quinolines.4d,5 Although,
C8 functionalization of quinoline N-oxides is not
explored much,6 various methods have been
developed for C2 functionalization.5a,5b,7 Among them, few reports are available on C8 arylation
of quinolines (Scheme 2).6a,6c,6d,6h In 2011, first Rh(II)(NHC)-catalyzed direct C8 arylation
of quinolines through C–H functionalization with aryl bromide
as a coupling partner has been reported by the Chang group.6a Later, Pd(II)-catalyzed C8 arylation of quinoline N-oxide has been reported with aryl halide as a coupling
partner by the Larionov group.6c In this
direction, the Chang group also reported Ir(III)-catalyzed C8 arylation6d of quinoline N-oxide with aryldiazonium
salt as an arylating source. In addition to these reports, the Liu
group reported C8 arylation of quinoline N-oxide
by using potassium aryltrifluoroborate as a coupling partner with
a limited substrate scope and low yields. In spite of all these examples,
cheaper metal, i.e., ruthenium has never been explored for C8 functionalization
of quinoline N-oxides. Arylboronic acid is also most
predominantly available and a cost-effective choice for arylation.
Herein, we disclosed Ru(II)-catalyzed distal sp2(C8–H)
arylation with arylboronic acids under mild reaction conditions (Scheme 2). During the compilation
of this work, similar transformation was also reported by the Chang
group,8 but the current methodology is
not limited only for quinoline N-oxide, it is also
applicable for the arylation of indolines, 6-(5H)-phenanthridinone
and N-tert-butylbenzamide substrates.
Additionally, use of the Rh(III) catalyst in place of Ru(II), afforded
an arylated product with N-oxide which provides opportunity for further
derivatization (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Regioselective C8 Functionalization of Quinoline N-Oxide
Result and Discussion
Initially, quinoline N-oxide (1a)
and arylboronic acid (2a) were reacted in the presence
of [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 (5 mol
%), AgSbF6 (20 mol %), Cu(OTf)2 (20 mol %),
Ag2CO3 (2.5 equiv), and dimethoxyethane (DME)
as solvent at 100 °C under open air to afford 20% yield of the
desired product (3a) along with quinoline (4a) as a side product (Table 1, entry 4). Therefore, we screened different silver additives
and oxidants, in order to reduce undesired quinoline and we found
that the combination of AgOTf, Cu(OTf)2, and Ag2O were appreciable to afford the arylated product and quinoline in
a 70:30 ratio (Table 1, entry 9). Further optimization study shows that triflic anhydride
(25 mol %) is also significant to carry out the reaction, which replaced
costlier metal triflate salt, that is, AgOTf and Cu(OTf)2 without affecting the reaction yield (Table 1, entry 1). Additionally, triphenylboroxine
(1 equiv) was found to be of approximately equal potency (entry 2).
Solvent screening indicated tetrahydrofuran (THF) as a solvent of
choice (entry 1, 4–5). Oxidant screening have shown Ag2O as the best one, while Ag2CO3, Cu2O, and Mn2O have shown inferior result than Ag2O (Table 1,
entry 6–8). Alone Cu(OTf)2 as an additive with oxidant
Ag2O gave 45% product yield (Table 1, entry 10). AgOTf instead of Tf2O was not able to give the product (Table 1, entry 11). Moreover, heat energy analysis
indicated that the forward reaction is compatible broadly throughout
30–100 °C, but traces of the side product was also observed
at 100 °C (Table 1, entry 12). Notably, we got rid of the undesired side reaction by
performing the reaction at 40 °C instead of 100 °C. We have
also tried other arylating agents such as trimethoxyphenylsilane (1
equiv AgF added additionally in order to make silane more reactive),
triphenylborane, and tetraphenyltin, which afforded low to moderate
yield of the desired product (Table 1, entry 3). We finalized the standard condition as
3 equiv phenylboronic acid, 5 mol % [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2, 25 mol % triflic anhydride, 2.5 equiv Ag2O, and THF as the solvent at 40 °C to afford 70% arylated
product along with quinoline as a byproduct.

With the best optimized condition, substrate scopes
with various
arylboronic acids as well as quinoline N-oxide have
been studied (Table 2). The reaction of C-2-substituted quinoline N-oxide 1b and 1c with 2a afforded the corresponding
C8 arylated products (3b–3c) in a good yield.
On the other hand, electron deficient quinoline N-oxide (1d and 1i) as well as polyaromatic
quinoline N-oxide (1j) provided up to
28% desired product yield (3d, 3i–3j). Variation of methyl at 4-position and 6-position gave a product
yield of 32 and 28%, respectively (3e & 3f), while 6-bromo quinoline N-oxide afforded 24%
of the product yield (3h). Electron-rich quinoline N-oxide (1g) rings were able to give the product
in 35% yield (3g). Next, differentially substituted arylboronic
acids were tested with 1a under optimal reaction conditions.
Electron-rich arylating sources like 4-amylphenylboronic acid, 3,5-dimethylphenylboronic
acid, 4-methylphenylboronic acid, and 4-methoxyphenylboronic acid
were able to afford the corresponding arylated product in moderate
to good yield (3k, 3l, 3m, 3o), while the electron-deficient arylating source like 4-nitrophenylboronic
acid gave no product. This indicates that nucleophilicity of the arylating
source is significant; more nucleophilic arylating sources are good
and vice-versa. Additionally, 4-chloro and 4-bromophenylboronic acids
gave 52 and 35% yield, respectively (3p and 3q), while 4-phenyl and 4-formylphenylboronic acid afforded 25 and
22% of product yield (3n and 3r).

a Reaction condition: 1 (0.4 mmol), 2 (1.2 mmol), [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 (5 mol %), Ag2O (2.5 equiv),
Tf2O (25 mol %), dry THF (2.0 mL) 40 °C, 16 h.

In order to investigate the standardized condition
scope with other
metal catalysts, we replaced Ru(II) metal with its isoelectronic species
Rh(III) (Table 1, entry
13), which gave 90% isolated yield of 8-phenylquinoline N-oxide instead of the deoxygenated product (3a). With
these re-optimized reaction conditions substrate scope was studied
(Table 3). Halogenated
quinoline N-oxide gave a good yield of the desired
product (5b), and additionally electron-rich quinoline
rings were twice better as compare to the electron-deficient ones
(5c and 5d). Moreover, 4-nitrophenylboronic
acid was not compatible, possibly due to weaker nucleophilic arylating
agent (5i). Besides this, 2-fluorophenylboronic acid
was not able to give the product (5j), and it may be
due to the steric factor as well as the fluoro group which is also
the electron withdrawing group inductively, deteriorating its reactivity.
Further, variation of meta and para-substituted phenylboronic acid
gave up to 66% of the corresponding arylated product with N-oxide
(5e–5h).

Indoline scaffolds are also one of the most important
bioactive
structural moieties which are widely present in vinblastine, strychnine,
and (−)-physostigmine.9 There were
also few reports for derivatization of the indoline scaffold in order
to get more valuable bioactive products.10

Therefore, we have tried to explore our arylation methodology
for
this important heterocyclic scaffolds with pyrimidine as the directing
part, which can be removed easily by heating it at 110 °C in
dimethyl sulfoxide solvent.11 Interestingly,
we got 90% corresponding C-7 arylated indoline product (7a) under slightly varied reaction conditions, that is, at 100 °C
with an oxygen atmosphere. Subsequently, electronically different
substituents at para and meta-position of phenylboronic acids were
found to be well tolerated under revised reaction conditions and afforded
a good yield of arylated products (7b–7f). We have also tried heteroarylation, as well as methylation by
utilizing their corresponding boronic acid on indolines but it was
found to be incompatible (7g–7h). Consequently,
we have also explored arylation of benzo[h]quinoline
and 6-(5H)-phenanthridinone with 2a,
which afforded 55 and 20% yield, respectively, at 100 °C with
no oxygen atmosphere (Table 4, entry 8 and 9). In the same direction,
the weak coordinating directing group-containing scaffold, that is, N-tert-butylbenzamide was reacted with 2a, which gave 65% arylation on the ortho position of the
amide group (10). These results show broad applicability
of our developed methodology.

a Reaction condition: 6 (0.4 mmol), 2 (1.2 mmol), [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 (5 mol %), Ag2O (2.5 equiv),
Tf2O (25 mol %), dry THF (2.0 mL), 100 °C, 20 h, O2 atmosphere for indoline substrates only.

In order to anticipate the mechanistic pathway, we
have carried
out control experiments. A parallel experiment showed that KH/KD = 1.40 (Scheme 3.), which implies
that the C–H bond cleavage might not be the rate limiting step.

Scheme 3 Parallel Experiment for KIE.
We have also tried to synthesize the ruthenacycle
intermediate
by the previously reported method12 but
we got quinoline oxygen coordinated ruthenium adduct Ru1, which have been characterized by NMR and single crystal X-ray diffraction
technique (Scheme 4a). Further, Ru1 is utilized in place of an active ruthenium
catalyst, which afforded the desired product in 50% yield (Scheme 4b).

Scheme 4 Synthesis
of the Ruthenium Adduct and Its Utility as an Catalyst.
No product was observed by reacting quinoline
with 2a, which confirmed the necessity of N-oxide as
a directing part in
the quinoline moiety (Scheme 5a). In order to confirm the role of Ru as an deoxygenating
agent, we have performed a preliminary experiment, one with the Ru(II)
metal and second with the Rh(III) metal in the absence of 2a, which afforded 35% yield of 4a in the first case,
while 1a was intact in the second case (Scheme 5b,c). In the same consequence,
we have added 1 mol % of the Ru catalyst under Rh-catalyzed reaction
conditions, which gave 48% arylated product 3a (Scheme 5d). These experiments
strongly recommend the role of the Ru(II) metal as a deoxygenating
agent along with catalytic activity in the same pot.

Scheme 5 Preliminary
Experiment Showing Ru as a Deoxygenating Agent.
Further studies have shown that there is stronger
bond dissociation
energy in case of the Ru–O bond as compared to that of the
Rh–O bond;13 therefore, it can act
as a driving force for the deoxygenation process in case of Ru-catalyzed
reaction conditions.

On the basis of these preliminary experiments,
we proposed the
probable catalytic cycle (Scheme 6). The reaction may proceed through the intermediacy
of Ru1 species, which may be formed through lewis acid
(ruthenium metal) and lewis base (N-oxide) interaction, followed by
C(8)–H activation leading to complex B, which
can undergo transmetallation with arylboronic acid to afford complex C, which may oxidized to their higher valent metal complex D, in order to facilitate easy reductive elimination to afford
product with N-oxide 5a, which can be easily deoxygenated
by the ruthenium catalyst in the same pot to afford the traceless
product 3a. Further, complex E can be oxidized
to their active Ru species to continue the catalytic cycle.

Scheme 6 Proposed
Mechanistic Pathway
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed a new
methodology for C8 arylation
of quinoline N-oxide, with by utilizing Ru(II)-catalyst
to afford deoxygenated arylated product in one pot. Moreover, we have
also explored the Rh(III) catalyst, which afforded an arylated product
with N-oxide. Additionally, we have also extended
this methodology for other class of important heterocyclic scaffolds,
indolines. Beside this, 6-(5H)-phenanthridinone and N-tert-butylbenzamide were also utilized
for arylation. The role of the Ru metal as a deoxygenating agent was
well explored which might be applied in future for other important
application.

Experimental Section
General Information

out in screw cap reaction vials under an air atmosphere. All the solvents
were bought from Aldrich in sure-seal bottle and used as such. Chemicals
were bought from Sigma-Aldrich, Alfa Aesar, and TCI. For column chromatography,
silica gel (230–400 mesh) and silica gel C18 from Merck was
used. A gradient elution using n-hexane/ethyl acetate
and MeOH/H2O was performed based on Merck aluminum TLC
sheets (silica gel 60F254) and silica gel C18 on TLC plates.

Analytical Information
The melting points were recorded
on a Brønsted Electrothermal 9100. All isolated compounds are
characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, IR, and liquid
chromatography (LC)/mass spectrometry (MS). In addition, all the compounds
are further characterized by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS).

Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were recorded either on a Bruker-Avance
600 or 300 and 565 (19F NMR) MHz instrument. All 1H NMR experiments were reported in units, ppm and were measured relative
to the signals for residual chloroform (7.24) and methanol (3.31 and
4.78) in the deuterated solvents. All 13C NMR spectra were
reported in ppm relative to deuterated chloroform (77.23) and methanol
(49.15) and all were obtained with 1H decoupling.

General Procedure for the Preparation of Quinoline N-Oxides5a,14
All the solid reactants, m-CPBA (4 mmol) and quinoline (2 mmol) were added in a Schlenk
tube and put under vacuum for 2 h, then CH2Cl2 (4 mL) was added at 0 °C. The reaction was allowed to stirred
at room temperature for 12 h. On completion, the reaction mixture
was extracted with ethyl acetate and the organic extract was dried
over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated under
reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by flash chromatography
on silica gel (230–400 mesh size) with n-hexane/EtOAc
to yield desired N-oxides.

General Procedure Preparation of Ru1(8)
Under an argon atmosphere, to an oven-dried
reaction vial equipped with a magnetic stirring bar was added a solution
of [(p-cymene)RuCl2]2 (60 mg,
0.1 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (1 mL), quinoline N-oxide (21.75 mg, 0.15 mmol), silver trifluoroacetate (44.17
mg, 0.2 mmol), and Li2CO3 (14.80 mg, 0.2 mmol).
The reaction mixture was stirred at 25 °C for 12 h. An additional
portion of silver trifluoroacetate (44.17 mg, 0.2 mmol) was added
and the reaction mixture was further stirred at 25 °C for 12
h. The mixture was filtered through a pad of Celite and concentrated
under reduced pressure. n-Hexane (1 mL) was added
to the oily residue and the mixture was stirred for 16 h to form a
yellow-green precipitant. After filtration, the filtrate was removed
and the residue was dissolved in CH2Cl2 (2 mL),
doped with n-hexane (3 mL), and the mixture was shaken
to precipitate out the dark green chunk, which was removed by filtration
through a pad of Celite. Slow evaporation of the filtrate at 25 °C
provided the crude product as an orange crystal, which was further
purified by recrystallization in CH2Cl2/n-hexane. Orange crystal (36.4 mg, 60%). 1H NMR

General Procedure for C8 Arylation of Quinoline N-Oxides with Arylboronic Acids
To an oven-dried screw cap
reaction vial charged with a Spinvane magnetic stirbar, the starting
material (0.4 mmol), arylboronic acid (1.2 mmol), [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2 (5 mol %), and silver oxide (2.5
equiv) were weighed, whereas liquid trifluoromethanesulfonate anhydride
(25 mol %) were added by a micropipette and dry THF was added by a
laboratory syringe, respectively. The reaction vial was closed with
a screw cap and allowed to stir at 40 °C for 16 h. After completion,
the reaction mixture was allowed to cool, filtered through a silica
plug, and washed with CH2Cl2, followed by workup
with aqueous NaHCO3 solution and CH2Cl2. The collected CH2Cl2 fraction of the crude
reaction mixture was evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue
was purified by flash chromatography using silica gel (230–400
mesh size) and n-hexane/EtOAc as an eluent. Note,
[RhCp*Cl2]2 was used instead of the Ru catalyst
in order to get the arylated product with N-oxide.

General Procedure for Arylation of Indolines and Other Substrates
with Arylboronic Acids
To an oven-dried screw cap reaction
vial charged with a Spinvane magnetic stirbar, the starting material
(0.4 mmol), arylboronic acid (1.2 mmol), [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2 (5 mol %), and silver oxide (2.5 equiv) were
weighed, whereas liquid trifluoromethanesulfonate anhydride (25 mol
%) were added by a micropipette and dry THF was added by a laboratory
syringe, respectively. The reaction vial was closed with a screw cap
and allowed to stir at 100 °C for 20 h. After completion, the
reaction mixture was allowed to cool, filtered through a silica plug,
and washed with CH2Cl2, followed by workup with
aqueous NaHCO3 solution and CH2Cl2. The collected CH2Cl2 fraction of the crude
reaction mixture was evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue
was purified by flash chromatography using silica gel (230–400
mesh size) and n-hexane/EtOAc as an eluent. C18-reversed phase silica gel was required in case of the benzamide
substrate by using MeOH and water as an eluent. An oxygen atmosphere
is required only in the case of indoline substrates.
