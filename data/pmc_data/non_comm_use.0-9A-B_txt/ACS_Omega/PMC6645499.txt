Supramolecular self-assembly is an
excellent tool for controlling
the optical and electronic properties of chromophore-based molecular
systems. Herein, we demonstrate how differential self-assembly affects
mechanoresponsive luminescence of fluorene-benzothiadiazole-based
fluorophores. We have synthesized two donor–acceptor–donor-type
conjugated oligomers consisting of fluorene as the donor and benzothiadiazole
as the acceptor. For facile self-assembly, both molecules are end-functionalized
with hydrogen-bonding amide groups. Differential self-assembly was
induced by attaching alkyl chains of different lengths onto the fluorene
moiety: hexyl (FB-C6) and dodecyl (FB-C12). The molecules self-assemble to form well-defined nanostructures
in nonpolar solvents and solvent mixtures. Although their optical
properties in solution are not affected by the alkyl chain length,
significant effects were observed in the self-assembled state, particularly
in the excitation energy migration properties. As a result, remarkable
differences were observed in the mechanochromic luminescence properties
of the molecules. A precise structure–property correlation
is made using UV–visible absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy,
time-correlated single-photon counting analysis, scanning electron
microscopy, and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy.

Introduction
Organic molecules exhibiting
excellent luminescence in the solid
state are attracting immense scientific interest because of their
potential applications in advanced optical and electronic devices.1−7 The luminescence properties of the molecules in the solid state
are dependent on the intermolecular interactions and hence affected
by the self-assembly or stacking mode of the chromophores.8−13 Thus, control over interchromophore interactions results in materials
with interesting stimuli-responsive properties and is a key of many
optical and electronic applications of materials based on π-conjugated
systems.14−20 Among various stimuli-responsive materials, mechanochromic luminescent
(MCL) materials attract special interest because of their fundamental
and technological relevances.21−32 These materials have the potential for applications in sensors,
optical information storage, and as security inks.33−40 Nevertheless, they are still at relatively incipient stages of investigation
compared with other kinds of stimuli-responsive (photo-, thermo-,
and electro-responsive) materials. This could be attributed to the
inherent complexities associated with the molecular structural factors
and intermolecular interactions, which make it difficult to design
an MCL material. Therefore, fundamental understanding of the role
of intermolecular interactions, self-assembly, and the underlying
photophysical properties is essential for further development in this
area.

In the present work, we study the self-assembly behavior
of fluorene-benzothiadiazole-based
fluorophores (Scheme 1) containing two different alkyl chains and the consequent effect
on the optical properties, particularly the MCL properties of the
resulting assembly. Although fluorene is a well-studied luminophore,
only a few reports have been published on fluorene-based MCL materials.41−44 Phase changes associated with mechanical grinding were cited as
the reason for luminescence changes in those reports. Although this
reasoning is correct in the bulk form, variations in the chromophore–chromophore
interactions at the molecular level and the resulting changes in the
photophysical properties such as excitation energy migration (EEM)
at the supramolecular level should also be considered. However, such
information is missing in most of the reports on organic-based MCL
materials, including the above-mentioned reports.45−47 Herein, we
try to understand the correlation among self-assembly, EEM, and MCL
properties in two structurally similar donor–acceptor–donor-type
fluorene-benzothiadiazole derivatives. Both molecules consist of a
benzothiadiazole (acceptor) unit sandwiched between two fluorene (donor)
derivatives. They were end-functionalized with hydrogen-bonding amide
groups for facile self-assembly. These two molecules differ only by
the side alkyl chains length on the fluorene, which is hexyl in FB-C6 and dodecyl in FB-C12. Our studies revealed
that the difference in alkyl chain length forced the molecules to
adopt different nanostructures on self-assembly, which in turn affected
the emission, excitation energy migration, and mechanochromic luminescence
switching properties of the resulting assembly.

Results and Discussion
Photophysical Properties in Solution
The UV–vis
absorption and fluorescence properties of FB-C6 and FB-C12 were recorded in different solvents with increasing
polarity (toluene, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and dimethylformamide (DMF);
concn = 10–5 M; l = 10 mm; λex = 430 nm for fluorescence studies and 410 nm for lifetime
measurements; Figure S1, Supporting Information
(SI)), and the observed photophysical parameters are summarized in Table 1. Both molecules showed
similar absorption and fluorescence characteristics in the above-mentioned
solvents, implying that their optical properties at the molecular
level are not affected by the alkyl chain length. No significant shift
in the absorption maxima was observed with varying solvents, indicating
that the dipole moments of the molecules in the ground state were
fairly insensitive to solvent polarity. In contrast, emission spectra
were red-shifted on increasing the solvent polarity (toluene, λem = 545 nm; and DMF, λem = 595 nm). This
could be attributed to the internal charge transfer (ICT) nature of
the molecules in the excited state, that is, the dipole moment of
the emissive state is higher than that of the ground state. Excited-state
lifetime was obtained from time-correlated single-photon counting
analysis; both compounds exhibited monoexponential decay in solution.
The lifetime was found to increase slightly with an increase in solvent
polarity, which could be attributed to the stabilization of the emissive
polar excited state in polar solvents, usually observed in compounds
having ICT characteristics.48,49

Aggregation in the DMF–Water Mixture
To study
the emission properties on aggregation, emission spectra of FB-C6 and FB-C12 were recorded in different DMF–water
fractions (Figure 1a,d). DMF solutions of both compounds emit strong fluorescence with
quantum yields of 43 and 57%, respectively. Upon addition of increasing
amounts of water to the DMF solution, initially the emission was quenched
and the maximum was blue-shifted. On further addition of water, the
emission intensity was gradually increased along with a red shift
in the maximum. Interestingly, the emission changes on addition of
water were remarkably different for FB-C6 and FB-C12. The blue shift of the maximum was gradual in the former (Figure 1b), whereas it was
spontaneous in the latter (Figure 1e). A maximum blue shift of 58 nm was achieved in FB-C6 when the water fraction reached 40%. On the other hand,
the maximum blue shift (55 nm) happened in FB-C12 on
the first addition itself (10%). It was also observed that quenching
was lower in FB-C6 (56%; Figure 1c) than that in FB-C12 (78%; Figure 1f). On further addition
of water, a remarkable red shift was observed in the former (35 nm),
whereas only marginal changes were observed for the latter (14 nm).
Emission was recovered to nearly 82 and 73% of the initial intensities
in FB-C6 and FB-C12, respectively, at higher
water fractions (70–80%). These changes could be attributed
to the formation of aggregates by the addition of water to the DMF
solution. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the aggregates
are shown in Figure 2. A further increase in water fraction (>80% in FB-C6 and >70% in FB-C12) results in the decrease of the
emission intensity probably because the aggregates attained a critical
size and began precipitation. The visual changes to the DMF solutions
under UV light in the presence of various amounts of water fractions
are shown in Figure 2c,d, respectively.

Self-assembly is a sensitive property, which is
affected by the
nature of the molecules as well as the microenvironment. Among the
various factors, the polarity of the molecules as well as the medium
plays a key role in the self-assembly process. To understand the difference
in the aggregation/self-assembly properties of FB-C6 and FB-C12 in the DMF–water mixture, it is important to
consider these aspects. The polarity index of DMF is 6.4 and that
of water is 10.2, implying that increasing the water fraction obviously
increases the polarity of the medium. On the other hand, considering
the structure of the molecules, the presence of four C12 chains makes FB-C12 more nonpolar than FB-C6 containing C6
chains. This made the former respond faster to the addition of water
and exhibit different emission colors at different water fractions
when compared to that in the latter. It was obvious that the addition
of water forces the molecules to aggregate, which would result in
lesser number of molecules exposed to the polar solvent medium, leading
to the blue shift of the emission maximum. The proximity of the chromophores
due to aggregation also facilitates nonradiative decay of the excited
state (Figure S3, SI), which could be attributed
to the quenching of fluorescence. A further increase of water fraction
in the medium could facilitate the formation of tightly packed aggregates,
which may improve the chromophores’ planarity and electronic
communication within the assembly, resulting in a red shift in the
emission relative to the initial aggregate emission. Tighter packing
may also hinder the rotational diffusion of the molecules, hence improving
the radiative decay of the excited state. This effect might be enough
to offset the emission quenching induced by the tighter packing of
the chromophores, thus resulting in an overall enhancement of the
emission intensity. The difference in the red shift at a higher water
percentage can also be explained in terms of alkyl chain length. Owing
to the presence of short alkyl chains, better packing would be possible
in FB-C6, resulting in better planarity and more red
shift. On the other hand, longer alkyl chains hinder the tight packing
in FB-C12, leading to less red shift. It must be noted
that addition of water into the DMF solution of both molecules does
not induce red shift of the emission maximum, particularly at the
initial water fraction (i.e., before the onset of aggregation), indicating
that the molecules are already in a charge transfer state in DMF and
no further polarization can happen on a further increase in the polarity
of the medium.

Self-Assembly Properties
Both molecules
contain amide
functionalities at terminal positions, and it is well established
that molecules appended with amide groups usually form self-assembled
structures through one-dimensional hydrogen bonding in nonpolar solvents.50,51 The one-dimensional assemblies of the molecules under study were
expected to undergo hierarchical self-assembly assisted by π–π
stacking between the chromophore backbone and van der Waals interaction
between the alkyl chains to form three-dimensional nanostructures.
To study the self-assembly properties, the molecules were dissolved
in toluene by gentle heating (∼50 °C), followed by slow
cooling to room temperature. The resulting precipitate was analyzed
through a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The SEM images revealed
the formation of self-assembled aggregates having hexagonal bricklike
structures in the case of FB-C6 (Figure 3a) and flat, rodlike structures for FB-C12 (Figure 3b). Although the exact reason for the difference in morphology is
not known, it could be assumed that the alkyl chains have a remarkable
effect on chromophore packing. For instance, the van der Waals interaction
would be less efficient in FB-C6 than that in FB-C12. On the other hand, steric effects would be more in the latter,
which may hinder the efficient π–π stacking between
the chromophores. In other words, the difference in alkyl chain length,
which does not have any effect on the molecular level properties,
has a significant effect on the supramolecular properties.

Mechanoresponsive Luminescence Properties
The pristine
powder samples of FB-C6 and FB-C12 obtained
by precipitation from cold toluene were yellow. The former showed
a yellow fluorescence (561 nm), whereas the latter showed a yellowish-green
fluorescence (538 nm) upon irradiation with UV light (365 nm). Hexyl-chain-substituted FB-C6 showed more red-shifted emission compared to that of
dodecyl-substituted FB-C12. As explained in the previous
section, the C6 chain exerts less steric hindrance than that of the
C12 chains, and as a result, more planar packing would be possible
in the former than that in the latter, which is in accordance with
the observation in the solvent mixture. The absolute fluorescence
quantum yield in the solid state was 56% for FB-C6 and
55% for FB-C12. Although the molecules exhibited different
emission colors in the pristine state, the color became same (yellowish-orange)
upon grinding (emission maxima of FB-C6 and FB-C12 were shifted 583 and 585 nm, respectively) and the fluorescence
quantum yields of both samples were reduced slightly. Interestingly,
the emission features could be reverted to those of the initial state
upon solvent (toluene) fuming. The emission spectral changes and the
corresponding photographs of the samples on grinding followed by solvent
exposure are shown in Figure 4. The fluorescence switching process could be repeated for
several cycles for both samples (Figure 4c,f), indicating the absence of any chemical
changes on applying mechanical force and exposing to solvent vapors.
The reversibility and reproducibility of the transition have great
significance for the application of these materials in sensors. No
noticeable changes were observed in the absorption spectra corresponding
to the π–π* transition (around 430 nm) of the samples
before and after grinding (Figure S4, SI).

Powder X-ray diffraction analysis was carried out to observe
the
changes in diffraction patterns upon grinding and solvent vapor exposure.
Owing to the presence of alkyl chains, both molecules were relatively
amorphous in nature, resulting in only weak diffraction signals (particularly
for FB-C12) even for the pristine samples (see Figure S5, SI). The peak intensities were further
diminished on grinding, as observed in several other MCL materials.52−57 Reappearance of the peaks upon fuming with toluene vapors signifies
the recovery of the initial states. To obtain a better understanding
about the underlying photophysical phenomenon associated with fluorescence
switching on applying mechanical force, time-resolved fluorescence
lifetimes of the materials in the pristine, ground, and fumed states
were monitored (Figure 5). The pristine samples of FB-C6 and FB-C12 exhibited biexponential decay with average fluorescence lifetimes
of 3.35 and 2.87 ns, respectively. Interestingly, the decay becomes
triexponential and the average lifetimes were increased to 4.48 ns
for FB-C6 and 4.43 ns for FB-C12 upon grinding.
It is a well-known fact that organic π-conjugated molecules
exhibit efficient excitation energy migration in the self-assembled
state similar to that in natural-light-harvesting systems.1,58−60 Literature reports suggest that a higher red shift
of emission occurs in self-assembled systems (compared to that in
the corresponding monomers) with efficient EEM.58−60 This is attributed
to the substantial loss of energy of the excitons during migration
through several chromophores. Furthermore, efficient EEM also results
in a relatively higher lifetime because the delocalized excitons take
more time for radiative recombination. On the other hand, emission
red shift and lifetime enhancement were found to be minimum in systems
with less efficient EEM. In the present case, more red-shifted emission
and higher lifetime (Δτ = 17%) of pristine FB-C6 clearly indicate that excitation energy migration is more efficient
in it than that in FB-C12. However, after grinding, both
emission maxima and lifetimes (Δτ = 1%) become comparable.

fluorescence decay profiles of (a) FB-C6 and (b) FB-C12 (instrument response factor).

Although both derivatives form self-assembled nanostructures
because
of the cooperative interaction of hydrogen bonding, π–π
stacking, and van der Waals forces at the molecular level, the emission,
fluorescence lifetime, and morphology analysis revealed that the basic
chromophore packing differs at the supramolecular level. From the
studies, it was assumed that FB-C6 is more planar in
the self-assembled solid state with strong chromophore–chromophore
interactions, whereas FB-C12 exhibits a weak chromophore
interaction because of the presence of longer alkyl chains. As a result,
better excitation energy migration would be possible within stacks
of the former, resulting in a higher red shift and longer lifetime.
On the other hand, energy migration is found to be less efficient
in the latter. The grinding obviously causes the disruption of the
supramolecular packing of the chromophores but forces them to have
a stronger interaction because of the close proximity. This situation
facilitates the excitons to travel further before decaying radiatively,
leading to a longer lifetime and further red shift. Because this is
a forced packing, the effect of alkyl chains is absent, yielding comparable
emission maximum and fluorescence lifetime. The difference in chromophore
interaction and energy migration before and after grinding is schematically
illustrated in Figure 6.

The green arrows indicate excitation energy migration.

Even though a large number of organic compounds
exhibit MCL properties,
our study illustrates how small structural changes in the molecules
influence the intermolecular interactions, self-assembly, and optical
properties, thus affecting mechanically induced luminescence behavior.
Most of the reports on MCL materials attribute phase changes associated
with mechanical grinding to luminescence switching. However, our studies
revealed the importance of considering the variation in excitation
energy migration properties associated with structural changes in
explaining MCL behavior of chromophore assemblies.

Conclusions
In summary, we have designed and synthesized two mechanoresponsive
luminescent chromophores, which consist of benzothiadiazole and alkylated
fluorenes end-functionalized with amide groups. These molecules differ
only in the length of alkyl side chains incorporated on the fluorene
units. Both luminophores are highly emissive in solution and solid
states. Their optical properties at the molecular level were not affected
by the alkyl chain length. However, significant differences were observed
in the self-assembly and optical properties of the resulting solid
samples. The differences in the emission and mechanoresponsive behaviors
of the samples were well correlated to the variation in excitation
energy migration in the self-assembled state. Our results demonstrated
that subtle manipulation in the molecular structure could lead to
differential self-assembly, resulting in interesting stimuli-responsive
behaviors.

melting point apparatus, and these are uncorrected. Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu IRPrestige-21
Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer. 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the compounds were recorded on a 500 MHz
Bruker Avance II spectrometer. All of the chemical shifts were referenced
to (CH3)4Si (TMS; δ = 0 ppm) for 1H or to CDCl3 (δ = 77 ppm) for 13C. High-resolution mass spectral analysis was carried out using a
JEOL JM AX 505 HA instrument.

scanning spectrophotometer using a quartz cell with 1 cm path length.
Fluorescence spectra were recorded using a SPEX-Fluorolog F112X spectrofluorometer
equipped with a 450 W xenon arc lamp. The spectra were corrected using
the program installed by the manufacturer. Solid-state UV–vis
absorption spectra of pristine and ground samples were recorded on
a Shimadzu UV-2600 UV–vis spectrophotometer. For the measurement,
the samples were kept in between two transparent quartz plates and

was lowered to 0 °C using an ice–salt bath. 2-(1H-7-Azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3 tetramethyl-uraniumhexafluorophosphate
(HATU) (98.85 mg, 1.30 mmol, 3.0 equiv) was added to it, and the temperature
was slowly allowed to rise to room temperature. After stirring for
8 h, the mixture was poured into water and extracted with DCM. The
combined organic extracts were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure.
The resulting mixture was purified by column chromatography (silica
gel, 10% MeOH–DCM). The pure product was obtained as a yellow
powder. Yield: 87%; mp: 245 °C; 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ [ppm] 7.99 (d, J = 7 Hz, 2H),
