Emulsions are traditionally prepared
by batched emulsifying an oil phase and aqueous phase with a magnetic/mechanical
stirrer, homogenizer, or ultrasonic machine, etc. Herein, high internal
phase emulsions (HIPEs) produced with a miniature twin screw extruder
were first investigated. Adding an oil phase (the mixture of styrene,
divinylbenzene, and span 80) and aqueous phase to the inlet of a miniature
twin screw extruder, a series of white and viscous HIPEs were obtained
at the outlet of the extruder. With the screw rotation speed and the
surfactant content varied respectively in the ranges of 50–200
rpm and 5–20%, a series of HIPEs having uniform droplet size
were produced. Polymerizing these HIPEs caused a series of polymerized
HIPES, which have a well-defined open-cell structure. The method developed
herein shows that it is possible to prepare emulsions with oil and
water by twin screw extrusion. Also, it may also cause a continuous
preparation of HIPEs when the miniature twin screw extruder was replaced
by an industrial extruder.

==== Body
Introduction
High internal phase emulsions (HIPEs) have been widely used in many
fields including food preparation, fuel, oil recovery, and cosmetics.1 If there are one or more monomers contained in
the continuous phase of HIPE, the viscous liquid property of the emulsion
allows polymerized HIPEs (polyHIPEs) with any shape.2,3 During the polymerization, the emulsion acts as a template for the
resulting polyHIPE. A polyHIPE is a kind polymer foam with a tunable
porous structure, low density, and very high pore volume, which make
the materials have great potential applications in areas such as scaffolds
for tissue engineering,4−6 water
treatment,7,8 supports for catalysis,9−12 and separation
membranes.13,14

HIPEs are defined as emulsions containing
internal phases over 74%, which lead to emulsions having nonuniform
or polyhedral droplets.15 Emulsion is a
mixture produced by dispersing liquid droplets in another liquid phase.
It is normally prepared by emulsifying these two immiscible liquids
with a magnetic/mechanical stirrer, homogenizer, or ultrasonic machine,
which provides the necessary energy to achieve a metastable state
by splitting one phase into another.

Conventional methods for
manufacturing HIPEs include dissolving appropriate emulsifiers (surfactant16,17 or solid particles18−25) in the components that make up the continuous phase and then gradually
adding dispersed phases to the continuous phase under continuous shearing,
such as magnetic/mechanical stirring,26 homogenizing,27 and ultrasonic emulsification
strategies.28 HIPEs prepared by different
shearing methods would have different properties, which mainly performed
in the difference in viscosity and stability of the emulsion and in
the pore size and mechanical properties of the resulting polyHIPEs.
Recent studies have focused on various shear-related issues, including
a two-rod
batch mixer29,30 and stirred cell membrane emulsification.31 However, although it is noted that the shearing
methods reported normally prepare HIPEs in a batched way, a continuous
and large-scale preparation method for fabrication of HIPEs is still
to be explored.

Alternatively, a twin screw extruder has been
widely used to continuously produce polymeric materials.32,33 Extrusion means forcing a material passing through a restricted
orifice (i.e., a die). A twin screw extruder is normally composed
of two rotating Archimedes screws, which are installed in a barrel
to gradually increase the pressure and push the ingredients forward
through the die, and the products are obtained in the die. The thermomechanical
treatment in the barrel helps to texture the product, while the expansion
in the die is responsible for the final product formation. The screw
speed, screw shape, die size and shape, temperature, pressure, and
water content are the most important parameters to control the process.34−37 Despite
the high operating temperature (up to 200 °C), high pressure
(over 10 MPa), and high shear rate, the extrusion polymer process,
also known as hot melt extrusion, is widely used in industry because
of its continuous, fast, simple, and versatile operation for converting
raw materials into final products.34 Extrusion
has been applied in the polymer industry for decades as a mass production
process to produce many products, such as tubes, frames, plastic plates,
and films. However,
extrusion has only recently attracted attention to the formation of
emulsion. Recently, a continuous emulsification technology, solvent-free
extrusion emulsification (SFEE), was developed to prepare submicron
particles (100–500 nm) from high-viscosity polymers (100–1000
Pa·s) by a twin screw extruder.38−40 Meanwhile, in most cases, emulsions are prepared
by emulsifying an oil phase and aqueous phase.

In this study,
a series of water-in-oil (W/O) HIPEs having uniform droplets were
first prepared with a miniature twin screw extruder (Figure 1). There is a circulation slot
inside the machine, which is different from the traditional industrial
twin-screw extruder. The presence of the circulation slot allows the
mixture of oil and aqueous phases to recycle flow in the barrel of
the extruder to overcome the shortcomings of the insufficient length
of the screw and barrel. Herein, by adding an oil phase (the mixture
of styrene, divinylbenzene, and surfactant span 80) and aqueous phase
to the inlet of the extruder, a series of white and viscous W/O HIPEs
were obtained at their outlet. The method developed herein may cause
a continuous preparation of HIPEs and improve the performance consistency
of the HIPE products and their resulting polyHIPEs when the miniature
twin screw extruder was replaced by an industrial extruder. The difference
in performance between different batches of emulsion made by a traditional
emulsifying method is one of the important factors limiting the application
of emulsion.

Experimental Section
Materials
Styrene (St, Shanghai Ling
Feng Chemical Reagent Co, Ltd., China) and divinylbenzene (DVB, 80%,
the remainder being m- and p-ethylstyrene,
Sigma-Aldrich) were purified by passing through neutral chromatographic
aluminum oxide to eliminate the inhibitor. Sorbitan monooleate (Span
80, 99%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China) was used as
supplied. Potassium persulfate (KPS, Adamas-beta, China) was recrystallized
before use. Sodium chloride was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical
Reagent Co., Ltd., China and used as received. Deionized water was
used.

Preparation of HIPE and polyHIPE
The HIPE was prepared with a twin conical screw miniextruder (Thermo
Electror, MiniCTW). The maximum and minimum diameters of the conical
screw were 13.4 and 4.4 mm, respectively. A mixture of St, DVB, and
Span 80 (the volume ratio 4:1:X was used as oil phase; Table 1; X represented the volume ratio of Span80). An aqueous solution containing
KPS and NaCl of 0.4 and 1.0 wt %, respectively, was prepared as the
aqueous phase. The temperature of the barrel of the extruder was kept
at 30 °C. The oil phase and aqueous phase were added to the inlet
of the extruder at a volume ratio of 1:5. After recycling the mixture
by the twin screw for 2 min, a milky white W/O HIPE was collected
from the outlet of the extruder (Table 1). The obtained HIPE was moved into a mold at 70 °C
over 24 h. Then, the polymerized HIPE (polyHIPE) was taken from the
mold, purified by ethanol in a Soxhlet extractor,40 and dried in an oven at 70 °C until a constant weight
was achieved.
The control sample HIPE 9 (Table 1) was prepared as the following: An oil phase
(4 mL, St/DVB/Span80 = 16:4:3) was poured into a 50 mL beaker and
stirred by a magnetic stirrer (length = 32 mm) at 800 rpm. Then, an
aqueous solution (20 mL) containing KPS and NaCl of 0.4 and 1.0 wt
%, respectively, was dropped into this oil phase at 30 °C. The
control sample HIPE 10 (Table 1) was prepared as the following: An oil phase
(4 mL, St/DVB/Span80 = 16:4:3) and an aqueous solution (20 mL, containing
KPS and NaCl of 0.4 and 1.0 wt %, respectively) were added to a 50
mL beaker and homogenized with an Ultra Turrax T18 homogenizer (rotor
diameter = 7 mm) at 12,000 rpm.

Characterization
The stability of HIPEs was detected by testing the backscattering
of infrared light (λ = 880 nm) from the emulsion with an optical
Turbiscan analyzer (Formulaction, France). Before testing, the HIPE
was poured into a flat bottomed cylindrical glass tube with height
and external diameters of 70 and 27.5 mm, respectively. Then, the
tube was placed in the instrument, and the backscattering of light
from emulsion was detected along the tube at 25 °C. The result
was given as the average backscattering of the sample versus time.40−44 The viscosity of the emulsions was measured
by a rotational rheometer (Thermo HAKKE, MARS3). Also, this measurement
was run with a shear rate varying from 0.01 to 20 s–1 at 25 °C. The HIPE images were performed by Nikon A1R laser
scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM). The LSCM was equipped with an
automatic inverted fluorescence microscope, a resonant scanner, and
an objective. Before observation, a fluorescent dye (Coumarin 6) was
added to the organic phase, and a laser line (488 nm) was used to
excite the dye. The average droplet size of the HIPE was calculated
from confocal images using the image analysis software Image J released
by the National Institute of Health (NIH, US). One hundred droplets
were measured for each HIPE. The photographs of HIPEs were performed
using a Nikon camera (SLR D90).

The polyHIPE morphology was
observed by a Hitachi S-3400 N SEM. Also, the average void size (D) and interconnecting pore size (d) were
determined from SEM images by measuring more than 100 voids with the
ImageJ software.

The interconnectivity degree (I) of the polyHIPE was calculated by eq 1:45 1  where n is the average
number of interconnected pores per void, d is the
average interconnected pore diameter, and D is the
average void diameter. More than 100 voids and interconnected pores
were correspondingly measured for each polyHIPE.

The compression
test of polyHIPEs was run with a universal material experiment machine
(LD104, SANS, China). Cylindrical monoliths having a diameter and
height of 6.0 and 10 mm, respectively, were used. The compression
test run at a velocity of 1.0 mm/min until half of the height of the
monolith reached. The compression modulus was obtained from the stress–strain
curve.

Results and Discussion
The screw speed was considered as one of the most important parameters
for controlling the polymer processing.41 Herein, aiming to study the effect of the screw rotation speed on
the HIPE and its resulting polyHIPE, a series of HIPEs were prepared
with varied screw rotation speeds (30, 50, 100, 150, or 200 rpm) as
shown in Figure 2.
It was found that the HIPE underwent quick separation as soon as it
reached the outlet of the extruder (Figure 2a) when the screw rotation speed was 30 rpm.
Also, increasing the screw speed to 50 or higher, the HIPEs were stable
after they were collected at the outlet of the extruder (Figure 2a,b).

Figure 2 Photos
of the HIPEs prepared by miniature twin screw extruder. HIPEs 1, 2,
3, 4, and 5 were prepared with the screw rotation speeds of 30, 50,
100, 150 and 200 rpm, respectively. Photos were taken (a) as soon
as the HIPEs collected from the outlet of the extruder and (b) after
24 h of replacement.

Further
analysis of the HIPEs 2–5 with Turbiscan
analyzer (Figure 3)
showed that the backscattering of these HIPEs increased with an increase
in a screw rotation speed, which meant that the stability of the HIPEs
was enhanced by increasing the screw speed.42−44 This conclusion was also confirmed by the
images taken by laser scanning confocal microscopy (Figure 4) and the viscosity of the
HIPEs measured by a rotational rheometer (Figure 5). One can see that increasing the screw
rotation speed decreased the average droplet size of the HIPEs and
increased the emulsions’ viscosity. The smaller the droplet
size and the higher the viscosity, the more stable the emulsions.45−48

HIPEs prepared
with varied screw rotation speeds. Shear rate gradually increased
from 0.01 to 20 s–1.

As shown in Figure 6 (samples 2–5), polymerizing these
HIPEs caused a series of polyHIPEs having a well-defined open-cell
structure, which was similar to those of the porous polymers from
traditional emulsifying methods (e.g., magnetic stirring (sample 9) and homogenizing (sample 10) in Figure 5). Samples 9–10 were prepared with the same composition as those of samples 2–5. The SEM analysis showed that as the
screw speed of the extruder increased, the void size distribution
became narrower (Figure 7), which agreed to the observation of HIPEs by laser scanning confocal
microscopy because the emulsion structure acts as a template for its
resulted polyHIPEs.1

Figure 6 SEM images
of polyHIPEs.
Samples 2–10 were produced by polymerizing
the HIPEs 2–10. HIPEs 2–5 were prepared by a twin screw extruder with
screw rotation speeds at 50, 100, 150, and 200 rpm, respectively.
The surfactant content for HIPEs 2–5 was 13 vol % relative to the continuous phase of HIPEs. HIPEs 6–8 were prepared by a twin screw extruder
with surfactant contents at 4.8, 9.1, and 16.7 vol %, respectively.
The screw rotation speeds for HIPEs 6–8 was 150 rpm. Samples 9 and 10 were from
the HIPEs prepared by magnetic stirring at 800 rpm and homogenizing
at 12000 rpm, respectively.

Figure 7 Void size distribution
of polyHIPEs from the
HIPEs prepared with different screw rotation speeds from (a) 50, (b)
100, (c) 150, and (d) 200 rpm.

Compared to
the polyHIPEs prepared with the same components and traditional methods
such as magnetic stirring (Table 1 and Figure 5; sample 9) and homogenizing (Table 1 and Figure 5; sample 10), the average void
sizes of the polyHIPEs prepared with a miniature twin screw extruder
were much larger (2- to 3-fold and 5- to 7-fold of those in polyHIPEs
prepared with magnetic stirring and homogenizing, respectively). This
phenomenon could be due to the shear rate difference among these three
emulsifying methods. Estimating from the rotation speed and diameter
of the screw (length of magnetic stirrer or rotor diameter of homogenizer),
one could find that the shear rates of the twin screw extruder, magnetic
stirring, and homogenizing were thousands, tens of thousands, and
hundreds of thousand millimeters per minute. They were orders of magnitude
different in shear rates. Thus, polyHIPEs with a large void size,
such as tens of micrometers, could be produced through a miniature
twin screw extruder. A large void size is required when the polyHIPE
is used in some fields such as tissue engineering.

As reported,
the void size played an important role in the mechanical performance
of porous materials.49 Therefore, compression
tests were run to check the effect of the void size on the mechanical
performance of the polyHIPEs. The stress–strain curves of the
polymers are shown in Figure 8, and their compression moduli are shown in Figure 9. However, one could see that
the polyHIPE prepared with a screw rotation speed of 50 rpm, having
the largest void size, had the poorest compression strength. With
increasing the screw rotation speed from 50 to 200 rpm, the average
void size of the resulting polyHIPEs decreased, and the compression
strength increased. The phenomenon was consistent with the relationship
between the void size and the compression modulus reported in the
literature45 in which a quasi-linear dependence
of Young’s modulus as a function of the pore size was mentioned
when the internal phase volume fraction was kept constant.45 This may be due to the fact that the polyHIPE
prepared with a higher screw rotation speed had a narrower void size
distribution (Figure 7). A broader void size distribution may tend to cause stress concentration
during the compression, which reduced the overall compression strength
of the polyHIPE. Moreover, the compression modulus of the polyHIPEs
prepared by a miniature twin screw extruder was compared with those
of prepared by conventional emulsifying such as magnetic stirring
and homogenizing (Figure 8). It could be found that the compression moduli of the polyHIPEs
from a miniature twin screw extruder were poorer than those of the
conventionally made polyHIPEs. This might also be contributed to narrow
void size distributions obtained by magnetic stirring or homogenizing
(Figure 6). When the
void size distribution of the polyHIPE was broad, the stress concentration
would be caused by the larger voids during the compression test, and
the polyHIPE first broke in the large voids and then spread to the
entire material. When the void size distribution of the polyHIPE was
narrow, the stress will be evenly dispersed on each void of the polyHIPE,
and the compression strength of the polyHIPE will be high.

speeds: (a) sample 2, 50 rpm; (b) sample 3,100 rpm; (c) sample 4, 150 rpm; (d) sample 5, 200 rpm. (e, f) Curves were from the polyHIPEs prepared with conventional
emulsifying methods: (e) magnetic stirring and (f) homogenizing.

modulus of polyHIPEs with varied screw rotation speeds.

As
reported in the literature, the surfactant played a critical factor
to tune the morphologies of HIPEs and the resulting polyHIPEs.2,46 Herein, the effect of the surfactant content on the HIPE was also
taken into account. Four HIPEs (Table 1, samples 6, 7, 4, and 8) were prepared with surfactant contents of 4.8,
9.3, 13, and 16.7 vol %, respectively, relative to the continuous
phase. The temperature of the barrel of the extruder was set at 30
°C, and the screw rotation speed for these samples was 150 rpm.
The HIPE images performed by laser scanning confocal microscopy (Figure 4) showed that the
droplet size decreased gradually with an increase in the surfactant
contents, which caused a decrease in the void size of the polyHIPEs
produced by polymerizing these four HIPEs (Table 1 and Figure 6). This phenomenon agreed to the effect of the surfactant
content on the HIPE and its resulting polyHIPE prepared with traditional
methods.14,50

Conclusions
HIPEs were firstly produced with a miniature twin screw extruder.
Also, polymerizing these HIPEs caused a series of polyHIPEs with a
well-defined open-cell structure. It was found that the stability
of HIPEs was enhanced with increasing the screw rotation speed and/or
surfactant content, which caused a decrease in the droplet size of
the dispersed phase and therefore a decrease in the void size of the
HIPE-templated polyHIPEs. The method developed herein shows that it
is possible to prepare emulsions with oil and water by twin screw
extrusion. Also, it may also cause a continuous preparation of HIPEs
when the miniature twin screw extruder was replaced by an industrial
extruder.
