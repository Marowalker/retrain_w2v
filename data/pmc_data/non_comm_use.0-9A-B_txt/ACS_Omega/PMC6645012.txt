Abstraction
of chloride from [W(CO)5{PPhCl2}] with AgOSO2CF3 leads to the phosphine triflate
complex [W(CO)5{PPhCl(OSO2CF3)}]
which undergoes electrophilic substitution reactions with N,N-diethylaniline, anisole, N,N-dimethyl-p-toluidine, toluene,
biphenyl, naphthalene, 2,7,9,9-tetramethyl xanthene, and allyltrimethylsilane
to form the chlorophosphine complexes [W(CO)5{PPhClR}],
where R = p-diethylanilinyl, p-anisyl,
2-(N,N-dimethyl-4-methylphenyl), p-tolyl, p-phenylphenyl, 1-naphthyl, 4-(2,7,9,9-tetramethylxanthyl),
and allyl. Abstraction of the second chloride with AgOSO2CF3 leads, in most cases, to the respective phosphine
triflates [W(CO)5{PPhR(OSO2CF3)}],
which react with ferrocene to form the ferrocenyl phosphine complexes
[W(CO)5{PPhR(C10H9Fe)}]. The W(CO)5 unit can be removed via photolysis in the presence of bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane
to form metal-free phosphines.

1 Introduction
Phosphines
containing three different substituents are of interest
because they are stereogenic at P and therefore chiral.1 Because barriers to inversion at P are high,2 chiral phosphines retain their stereochemistry,
and chiral nonracemic phosphines can be isolated and used as ligands
for asymmetric catalysis3 and used directly
for organic catalysis.4 The synthesis of
heteroleptic phosphines from simple starting materials such as chlorophosphines
typically requires a strategy to control the degree of substitution.5 This can be done by using weak nucleophiles such
as mercury or lead alkyls, which selectively substitute a single chloride,6 or through the use of leaving groups of varying
ability7 or protection–deprotection
strategies.8 In many cases, controlled
monosubstitution can be achieved with Grignard or lithium reagents,
particularly when adding large groups.9 However, all of these strategies rely on organometallic nucleophiles,
limiting potential substrates and limiting functional group tolerance.5b It would be advantageous to be able to use milder
nucleophiles to form P–C bonds in a controlled, sequential
fashion to form P-stereogenic phosphines, widening the range of potential
substrates. One method that can be used to enhance P electrophilicity
is chloride abstraction from chlorophosphines to form phosphenium
ions, which then react with milder organic nucleophiles such as aromatic
compounds.10 Although this methodology
has been known for a long time, it is not widely applied. We reasoned
that the electrophilicity of phosphenium ion intermediates might be
enhanced by coordinating them to an electron-poor transition-metal
complex.11 Metal-coordinated phosphenium
ions have been studied extensively,12 but
prior to our work, little work had been done on their applications
toward P–C bond formation.12a,13 By contrast,
activation of C–H and C–X bonds by metal-coordinated
phosphinidenes to form phosphines is well-established.14

We have shown that by coordinating a chlorophosphine
to a W(CO)5 complex and then extracting chloride with AlCl3 or AgOSO2CF3, we can generate highly
electrophilic
phosphenium ions or phosphine triflates that react with a wide range
of organic substrates, including arenes, heteroarenes, alkenes, and
alkynes (Scheme 1).15 The purpose of this study is to apply this methodology
sequentially to form phosphines with three different substituents,
using dichlorophenylphosphine as a starting point. Portions of this
work have been communicated.16

Scheme 1 2 Results and Discussion
The precursor
complex [W(CO)5{PPhCl2}] (1) is
easily synthesized from W(CO)6 and PPhCl2.17 Reaction of 1 with
AlCl3 in CH2Cl2 led to a solution
with no observable 31P signals, suggesting that an equilibrium
mixture of 1 with the phosphenium ion complex [W(CO)5{PPhCl}][AlCl4] is formed and that the dynamic
exchange is leading to the broadening of the signal. At temperatures
below −10 °C, the signal resolves into a peak at δ
128.7, which corresponds to the chemical shift for 1.
No downfield peak that can be assigned as the phosphenium ion complex
was observed. This suggests that the equilibrium lies far toward the
starting chlorophosphine (Scheme 2). However, the reactivity of this solution clearly
shows that the phosphenium ion is formed. A similar equilibrium between
the chlorophosphine complex and the phosphenium complex was observed
when chloride was abstracted from [W(CO)5{PPh2Cl}].15

Scheme 2 Reaction of the 1/AlCl3 mixture with 1
equiv of N,N-diethylaniline resulted
in electrophilic aromatic substitution, leading to the bis-para-anilinyl phenyl phosphine complex 2, along
with unreacted 1, in a 1:1 ratio.16 Compound 1 does not react with N,N-diethylaniline in the absence of AlCl3. This reaction is strong evidence for the formation of the phosphenium
ion complex, even though it could not be directly observed. No evidence
for a monosubstituted product was observed. Complete conversion to
disubstituted product 2 can be achieved by using 3 equiv
of AlCl3 and 2 equiv of N,N-diethylaniline (Scheme 3). Excess AlCl3 is used because it increases the
proportion of the phosphenium ion complex generated in the equilibrium
shown in Scheme 2,
thus increasing the reaction rate. The hydrochloric acid generated
likely protonates the amine groups in the reaction mixtures but is
scavenged by silica gel during chromatography, allowing the isolation
of the neutral product. The lack of monosubstitution can be rationalized
by considering the relative stabilities of the phosphenium intermediates
involved. The first substitution involves a chloro-phenyl phosphenium
intermediate, which is destabilized by the electron-withdrawing chloro
substituent. The second substitution involves an anilinyl-phenyl phosphenium
intermediate, which is stabilized by the π-electron-rich anilinyl
substituent. Chloride abstraction from the monosubstituted product
is therefore more favorable than chloride abstraction from the starting
dichlorophosphine, and disubstitution is favored.

Scheme 3 Reagents
and conditions: AlCl3 (3 equiv), N,N-diethylaniline
(2 equiv), CH2Cl2, room temperature (RT), 36
h.

From these results, it was clear that the
AlCl3-generated
phosphenium ion would not allow monosubstitution in most cases. As
a result, we next examined AgOSO2CF3 as a chloride-abstracting
reagent. Previously, we have shown that AgOSO2CF3 can be used to convert chlorophosphine complexes into phosphine
triflate complexes, which react in the same fashion as phosphenium
ion complexes.15,16 Reaction of 1 with
AgOSO2CF3 led to [W(CO)5{PPhCl(OSO2CF3)}] (3) (Scheme 4), which was characterized in solution as
a reactive intermediate (δ 31P = 162.5, 1JPW = 376 Hz) but was not isolated.

Scheme 4 Reagents and conditions: AgOSO2CF3 (1.3 equiv),
CH2Cl2,
RT, 3 h.

The phosphine triflate 3 reacts with a wide range
of organic nucleophiles, allowing for the controlled introduction
of single substituents onto phosphorus. For example, the activated
aromatic compounds N,N-diethylaniline
and anisole readily add to 3, leading to the expected
para-substituted products 4(16) and 5 (Scheme 5). Both of these reactions are rapid at RT and high-yielding.
Substitution can also be readily directed to the ortho position by
blocking the para position, as demonstrated in the reaction of 3 with N,N-dimethyl-p-toluidine to form compound 6, in which the
chlorophenylphosphine unit has added ortho to the N(CH3)2 group (Scheme 5).

Scheme 5 Reagents and conditions: (i) N,N-Diethylaniline (2 equiv), CH2Cl2, RT, rapid. (ii) Anisole (4 equiv), CH2Cl2, RT, 30 min. (iii) N,N-Dimethyl-p-toluidine (2 equiv), CH2Cl2, rapid.

The reactivity of 3 was probed further with reactions
with aromatic substrates that are less activated toward electrophilic
aromatic substitution, toluene, biphenyl, and naphthalene. Although
the reactions are slower than those of anisole and aniline, compound 3 activates all of these substrates, leading to p-tolyl, p-phenylphenyl, and naphthyl chlorophenylphosphine
complexes 7, 8, and 9, respectively
(Scheme 6). By contrast,
the diphenyl phosphine triflate tungsten complex [W(CO)5{P(OSO2CF3)Ph2}] we described previously
does not react with any of these substrates,15 clearly showing that 3 is more electrophilic. The greater
electrophilicity of 3 can be attributed to the electron-withdrawing
Cl substituent, which enhances electrophilicity at P. Compound 3 does not activate benzene or chlorobenzene.

Scheme 6 Reagents
and conditions. (i)
Toluene (15 equiv), CH2Cl2, RT, 36 h. (ii) Biphenyl
(10 equiv), CH2Cl2, RT, and 60 h. (iii) Naphthalene
(10 equiv), CH2Cl2, RT, 48 h.

One of our interests is the application of the methodology
described
here to bidentate ligands. To examine this possibility, 3 was added to di-p-tolyl ether, with the expectation
that a PPhCl unit could be added to the position ortho to the ether
linkage in both rings. Diaryl ethers form the backbones of several
catalytically useful bisphosphine ligands.18 However, the observed product 10 results instead from
addition of a single PPh unit to a position bridging the ortho carbons
of both phenyl rings (Scheme 7). This reaction is an exception to the typical monosubstitution
observed in reactions with 3. The reactivity can be attributed
to the proximity of the second ortho H atom to the P center. A similar
electrophilic aromatic substitution has been used to form the metal-free
phosphine from di-p-tolyl ether and PPhCl2 but required a temperature of 130 °C.19

Scheme 7 Reagents and conditions. (i)
Di-p-tolyl ether (2.5 equiv), CH2Cl2, RT, 12 h. (ii) 2,7,9,9-Tetramethyl xanthene (1.5 equiv),
CH2Cl2, RT, 2 h.

The
disubstitution reaction observed with di-p-tolyl
ether can be prevented if a more rigid bisaromatic substrate
is used. The substrate 2,7,9,9-tetramethyl xanthene, which also has
the same backbone as a number of useful bisphosphine ligands,8b,18a,20 was added to 3,
leading to substitution in the 4 position of one of the aromatic rings,
as expected (Scheme 7). The monosubstitution is confirmed by the loss of symmetry, the
appearance of four chemically inequivalent methyl groups in the 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra, and the appearance of
a 1JPC of 34.3 Hz in the 13C resonance of C in the 4 position. Unfortunately, attempts
to add a second PClPh unit in the 5 position were not successful,
probably as a result of the steric size of the metal complexes.

The nonaromatic nucleophile allyltrimethylsilane (allylTMS) also
reacts readily with 3, leading to the chloroallyl phosphine
complex 12 (Scheme 8). The newly introduced allyl substituent is readily
identified in the 1H NMR spectrum of the product, which
shows peaks for the CH2 group at δ 3.39 and alkenyl
H atoms at δ 5.26 (2H) and δ 5.68.

Scheme 8 Reagents
and conditions: allylTMS
(3 equiv), CH2Cl2, RT, rapid.

The second substitution step can be achieved by converting
the
chlorophosphines formed in the first step into triflates using silver
triflate (Scheme 9).
Ferrocene was then added to all of the various phosphine triflate
intermediates, leading to a series of phenyl-ferrocenyl phosphines,
with a variety of substituents in the third position (see Scheme 9 and Chart 1). The majority of the chlorophosphines
formed above can be substituted using this methodology, with some
exceptions described below. Isolated yields range from 86 to 94%.
Conversion to the triflate requires 2–3 h at RT for most precursors.
Once the triflate has been formed, ferrocene addition is rapid. In
all cases, the successful addition of ferrocene is readily apparent
from the loss of symmetry in one of the two ferrocene Cp rings, apparent
in the 1H and 13C spectra. The 13C resonances for the P-bound Cp ring also show 31P coupling,
confirming the P–C bond formation.

Scheme 9 Chart 1 In some cases, the
second substitution can be carried out using
AlCl3 as the chloride abstractor. For example, p-tolyl, p-phenylphenyl, and naphthyl chlorophenylphosphine
complexes 7, 8 and 9 were successfully
converted to the ferrocenyl phosphines 19, 20, and 21, respectively, using AlCl3 and ferrocene;
however, the yields were lower than those of the AgOSO2CF3 reactions. By contrast, anisyl and xanthyl chlorophenylphosphine
complexes 5 and 11 did not react with AlCl3 and ferrocene. We attribute this lack of reactivity to the
quenching of the AlCl3 Lewis acidity via interaction with
the oxygen of the anisyl and xanthyl groups present in these compounds.

One exception to the generality of the AgOSO2CF3 methodology occurs with the N,N-diethylaniline-substituted complex [W(CO)5{P(Cl)Ph(p-C6H4NEt2)}] (4). Attempts to abstract chloride from 4 using AgOSO2CF3 resulted in an insoluble precipitate, rather
than the desired triflate intermediate. Addition of AlCl3 to 4 led to a blue solution and the formation of a
secondary phosphine complex (evident from large 1JHP in the 31P spectrum of the reaction
mixture), rather than a phosphenium ion, presumably via a radical
process. However, if the reactive substrate is added to the solution
prior to the chloride abstraction with AlCl3, the desired
electrophilic substitution reaction occurs. This is illustrated here
by the addition of allylTMS and then AlCl3 to compound 4, which leads to the allyl-anilinyl-phenyl phosphine complex 23 (Scheme 10).16

Scheme 10 Reagents and conditions:
allylTMS
(3 equiv), AlCl3 (1 equiv), CH2Cl2, RT, rapid.

Compound 6, formed
from the addition of N,N-dimethyl-p-toluidine to 1, also reacts with chloride
abstractors in a unique fashion.
Abstraction of chloride from 6 with either AlCl3 or AgOSO2CF3 leads to a product with a 31P chemical shift of δ 230.1. The fact that both chloride
abstractors appear to give the same product suggests that the AgOSO2CF3 reaction does not form a phosphine triflate,
as it does in all other cases. The chemical shift is also not consistent
with a phosphenium ion complex, which would be expected to appear
close to δ 429, the observed shift for [W(CO)5{PPh2}][AlCl4].15 Instead,
we propose that these reactions are leading to the internally base-coordinated
phosphenium ion complex 24 (Scheme 11). In contrast to the precursor 6, the 1H NMR spectrum of 24 shows two chemically
inequivalent N-bound methyl groups at δ 2.67
and 3.39. Furthermore, these resonances both show 31P couplings
of 4.2 and 10.2 Hz, respectively. The methyl group inequivalence and 31P coupling provide strong evidence for N to P coordination.
Further support for the proposed structure of 24 comes
from the DFT/B3LYP-optimized structure (Figure 1). Both N-coordinated and uncoordinated structures
were optimized, and the N-coordinated structure was found to be more
stable by 5.5 kcal/mol. The calculated P–N distance of 2.146
Å is very long for a P–N single bond (typical value of
1.683 Å21) but well within the sum
of the van der Waals radii (3.35 Å).22 The Mayer bond order was calculated as 0.436. These calculations
indicate that the N→P dative bond is weak, probably as a result
of the steric constraints of the resulting ring system. For comparison,
an X-ray crystal structure of a compound with an amido donor and a
phosphonium acceptor connected by the same organic backbone showed
P–N distances of 1.842(7) and 1.839(6),23 whereas a similar amine-coordinated phosphine showed a
P–N distance of 3.014(3) Å,24 and amine-coordinated dithioxo- and diselenoxophosphoranes showed
P–N distances of 2.038(8) Å25 and 2.039(5) Å, respectively.26

Scheme 11 Reagents and conditions: (i)
AlCl3 (1.1 equiv), CH2Cl2, RT, rapid.
(ii) Indole (1.1 equiv), CH2Cl2, RT, rapid.

We were not able to isolate compound 24, so a derivative
has been formed to support its characterization. Compound 24 reacts with indole to form the indolyl phosphine complex 25, which has been fully characterized (Scheme 11). Electrophilic addition of metal-coordinated
phosphine triflates to indole is well-established,11,15 and this reaction demonstrates that 24 shows the same
reactivity as analogous phosphine triflate complexes, providing further
evidence for a weak P–N bond.

To illustrate the range
of substrates that can be added in the
second step, the chloro-allyl-phenyl phosphine complex 12 was chosen. It was converted into the allyl-phenyl-triflate phosphine
complex 26 via the reaction with AgOSO2CF3 (Scheme 12). Addition of ferrocene led to the allyl-ferrocenyl phosphine complex 27. Addition of N,N-diethylaniline
to 26 led to the expected allyl-p-anilinyl
phosphine complex 23, which was also synthesized previously
by introducing the groups in the opposite order.16 The reaction of 26 with phenylacetylene led
to the alkynyl-allyl phosphine complex 28.

Scheme 12 Reagents and conditions: CH2Cl2, RT. (i) AgOSO2CF3 (1.2
equiv), 12 h. (ii) Ferrocene (1 equiv), rapid. (iii) N,N-Diethylaniline (2 equiv), rapid. (iv) Phenylacetylene
(3.7 equiv), 2 h.

In general, the second substrate
addition is limited to a narrower
range of substrates because the phosphenium ion or phosphine triflate
intermediate is less electrophilic than the intermediate in the first
addition, which has an electron-withdrawing chloro substituent. Unlike
compound 3, compound 26 does not react with
toluene, naphthalene, or biphenyl. To apply this sequential strategy
to phosphine formation, the least reactive substrate should be added
first.

If the free phosphine is the desired final product, removal
of
the W(CO)5 unit can be readily achieved via the photolysis
of phosphine complexes in the presence of bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane
(dppe).15 This reaction occurs via the
photolytic dissociation of a CO ligand, followed by the coordination
of one end of the bidentate phosphine. The other end of the phosphine
then displaces the desired product, with [W(CO)4(κ2-dppe)] as the side product.15 This
reaction is a variation of the thermal method originally developed
by Mathey et al.27 Using this strategy,
we transformed the tungsten phosphine complexes 19 and 22 into the free phosphines 29 and 30, respectively, using 1.2 equiv of dppe (Scheme 13). The conversion on both reactions is quantitative
by 31P NMR, and the products were obtained in high yields
after flash chromatography purification.

Scheme 13 Reagents
and conditions: dppe
(1.2 equiv), UV radiation (260 nm max.), tetrahydrofuran (THF), RT,
3 h.

3 Conclusions
Metal-coordinated
dichlorophenylphosphine is a useful precursor
for electrophilic substitution reactions. If AlCl3 is used
to abstract chloride, disubstituted products are formed, but if AgOSO2CF3 is used, controlled monosubstitution can be
achieved. The chloro-triflate intermediate used in these reactions
is more strongly electrophilic than the previously described phosphine
triflate complexes, allowing the activation of substrates as unreactive
as toluene. This greatly widens the range of potential substrates
that can be used to form phosphine substituents. Substitution of the
second chloro substituent with a different substrate leads to phosphines
with three different substituents, which are P-stereogenic. Furthermore,
all of these reactions can be carried out at RT or lower. Thus far,
this methodology is not enantioselective; that is, it leads to chiral
racemic phosphines. A future challenge is to develop an asymmetric
version of this methodology.

4.1.11 Synthesis of [W(CO)5{PPh(C5H4FeCp)(C13H5O(CH3)4)}] (22)
[W(CO)5{PPhCl(C13H5O(CH3)4)}] (11, 70 mg, 0.099 mmol) and AgOSO2CF3 (33.2 mg,
0.129 mmol) were dissolved in CH2Cl2 (4 mL).
This solution was stirred for 3 h, resulting in the formation of a
white precipitate, which was removed via filtration through Celite.
The solution was shown to contain [W(CO)5{PPh(OSO2CF3)(C13H5O(CH3)4)}] (17). The yield is quantitative by NMR spectroscopy.
Ferrocene (40.0 mg, 0.199 mmol) was then added and the resulting solution
was stirred for 15 min, resulting in a color change to brown from
yellow. The solvent was removed in vacuo, and the residue was purified
by flash chromatography (alumina, 10/90 v/v diethyl ether/petroleum
ether). Orange crystals of [W(CO)5{PPh(C5H4FeCp)(p-C6H4OCH3)}] (22) were obtained by cooling a saturated
pentane/CH2Cl2 solution to −20 °C.

4.2 Computational
Details
All gas-phase
computations for compound 24 were performed using the
hybrid density functional B3LYP level of theory,29 as implemented in Gaussian 09 electronic structure code.30 Vibrational frequency computations were performed
to ensure that the optimized structures are true minima. The basis
sets LANL2DZ31 for W and 6-31g(d,p)32 for other atoms were used for optimization and
frequency computations, and the basis sets LANL2TZ(f)31 for W and 6-311g+(2d,p)33 for
other atoms were used for the single-point computations. The LANL2TZ(f)
basis set information was extracted from the EMSL basis set library.34 The energies (ΔG) given
are corrected for zero-point vibrational energies. Mayer bond orders35 on the optimized structure were obtained using
the AOMix program.36
