As a guest molecule of urea clathrate,
a long-chain normal alkane
and its derivative with low substituents in methanol solutions have
been reported. To investigate the role of methanol in the urea clathrate
formation, in the present study, we used propane (C3H8), propylene (C3H6), ethane (C2H6), and methane (CH4) as guest molecules.
Raman spectra and powder X-ray diffraction profiles revealed that,
regardless of the existence of methanol, the C3H8, C3H6, and C2H6 molecules
are enclathrated into urea clathrates with a hexagonal structure,
whereas there is no urea clathrate formation enclathrating CH4. The pressurization of the urea clathrates including C2H6 and C3H8 reveals that
no pressure-induced structural phase transition occurs at pressures
up to 200 MPa. In spite of the guest molecule much shorter than the
lattice constant of the c-axis of the hexagonal channel
structure, the urea clathrates have a fairly rigid structure against
the compression. Methanol as an auxiliary solution is not always necessary
for the urea clathrate formation. Methanol plays a role in decreasing
the activation energy of the urea clathrate formation, although it
makes urea clathrate thermodynamically unstable due to the high solubility
of urea in methanol.

1 Introduction
Some organic compounds
form an inclusion compound with suitable
guest species. The inclusion compounds have been studied as a medium
of separation and storage, a specific reaction field, and so on. It
is well known, as one of them, that urea molecules form an inclusion
compound (hereafter, urea clathrate) with a hexagonal channel structure
in which a guest molecule is enclathrated.1−3 Host structure
of urea clathrate, like a honeycomb, is hydrogen-bonded between urea
molecules and commonly a hexagonal structure (space group, P6122).4 This host
structure is stable only when the channels are filled with a dense
packing of guest molecules.5 It is well
known that, as a guest molecule of urea clathrate, a long-chain n-alkane or its derivative with low substituents is enclathrated.
The stereoselectivity (shape and size) of urea clathrates, that is,
how it can be a guest molecule of urea clathrate is still the focus
of attention for chemical engineers, especially in the fields of gas
separation and gas storage.

The thermodynamic stabilities of
urea clathrates under atmospheric
pressure have been reported.6,7 White et al.7 reported the thermodynamic stability of urea
clathrates with three different alkanes (decane, dodecane, and hexadecane).
The shorter the alkane in the urea clathrate, the lower the equilibrium
temperature of the urea clathrate under atmospheric pressure.7 This literature suggests that the stability of
urea clathrate depends on the melting point of the guest molecule
and, at a temperature above the melting point of the guest molecule,
urea clathrate becomes much less stable in competition with liquefying
the guest molecule. Therefore, a short-chain molecule, having relatively
low melting point, could make urea clathrates unstable at ambient
temperature. Then, when the urea clathrate is formed in a saturated
methanol solution of urea, instead of the formation of urea clathrate,
the original urea crystal with tetragonal structure is recrystallized.1

The n-heptane (n-C7H16) has a molecular-length similar
to the unit lattice
of c-axis (ch) of the
host hexagonal structure.8 That is, in
the case of an n-alkane shorter than n-C7H16, the length of n-alkane
(cg) as a guest molecule in the urea clathrate
is shorter than that of ch. The schematic
illustration is shown in Figure 1. The shorter length of the guest molecule leads to
structural instability in the urea clathrate. How small molecule form
the urea clathrate is very interesting. In the early literature,9 propane (C3H8) and n-butane (n-C4H10) as the small guest molecules enclathrated into urea clathrate had
been reported. Moreover, the urea clathrate with C3H8 (hereafter, C3H8/urea clathrate; G/urea
clathrate (G: guest molecule)) was formed without dissociation of
urea to methanol in advance, whereas the C3H8/urea clathrate was not formed in the presence of methanol.4,5 The formation of n-C4H10/urea
clathrate is independent of the existence of methanol. The role of
methanol, which is generally considered as an auxiliary solvent, has
not been understood yet.

Figure 1 Schematic illustration of hexagonal urea clathrate
structure. The
symbols cg and ch stand for the length of the neighboring n-alkane (guest molecule, red) and the lattice constant of the c-axis of host framework, respectively. For the detailed
structures (at the molecular level) of a hexagonal urea clathrate
and a tetragonal urea crystal, please refer to the refs (2) and (4).

In the present study, to clarify how small molecules can
be enclathrated
in urea clathrates and why the existence of methanol affects the urea
clathrate formation, the urea pressurized directly with methane (CH4), ethane (C2H6), C3H8, and propylene (C3H6) in the presence
or absence of methanol has been investigated by means of Raman spectroscopy.
The crystal structure of the formed urea clathrates has been analyzed
by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). The stability of the formed urea
clathrates against the pressure has been investigated.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Urea Clathrate Formation
without Methanol
Figure 2 shows the
Raman spectra corresponding to the intramolecular C–N and N–H
stretching vibrations of urea and the intramolecular C–H stretching
vibration of the guest molecule in the CH4 + urea, C2H6 + urea, C3H6 + urea, and
C3H8 + urea binary systems (without methanol)
accompanied by those of the n-C8H18/urea clathrate and pure solid urea. Every spectrum was measured
at the same condition (atmospheric pressure and 77 K). The n-C8H18/urea clathrate has a hexagonal
channel structure, whose space group and lattice constants are P6122 and (a = 0.81874 nm, c = 1.10046 nm),1 respectively.
The n-C8H18/urea clathrate
was formed by cooling the mixture of n-C8H18 and the saturated methanol solution of urea.

Figure 2 Raman spectra
of the intramolecular C–N (upper) and C–H
and N–H (lower) stretching vibrations of (a) CH4 + urea binary system at 140 MPa, (b) C2H6 +
urea binary system at 49.3 MPa, (c) C3H6 + urea
binary system at 66.4 MPa, (d) C3H8 + urea binary
system at 95.0 MPa, (e) n-C8H18/urea clathrate, and (f) pure solid urea. All the samples were prepared
at 253 K for a couple of days. All the spectra were recorded at 77
K and atmospheric pressure. The peaks of the intramolecular C–C
and C–H stretching vibrations derived from guest molecule are
included in the upper and lower panels, respectively.

The Raman spectra of urea in the C2H6 + urea,
C3H6 + urea, and C3H8 +
urea systems shown in Figure 2b–d are similar to that of n-C8H18/urea clathrate shown in Figure 2e and different from those of the CH4 + urea system and pure solid urea shown in Figure 2a,f. Moreover, the last two
spectra of Figure 2a,f are also similar. The Raman peaks detected around 3230 and 3360
cm–1 of C2H6 + urea, C3H6 + urea, and C3H8 + urea
systems are slightly shifted to lower wavenumber side and higher wavenumber
side, respectively, compared to those of n-C8H18/urea clathrate. It is speculated that the enclathration
of a guest molecule smaller than a unit length along the c-axis of the hexagonal structure of urea clathrate would affect the
host structure of urea clathrate. The n-heptane (n-C7H16) has similar molecular length
to the unit lattice of the c-axis of the hexagonal
structure.8 Raman shifts of the intramolecular
C–H and C–C stretching vibrations of guest molecules
were different from those of pure guest molecules. In the case of
C2H6 + urea system, as a typical result, Raman
shifts of the intramolecular C–C stretching vibration of C2H6 (detected around 995 cm–1)
are shown in Figure 3. These results reveal the formation of the C2H6/urea, C3H6/urea, and C3H8/urea clathrates, similar to the n-C8H18/urea one. We pressurized the CH4 + urea
system at a pressure up to 200 MPa, but the urea molecules construct
no clathrate structure and remain as solid urea. The CH4 molecule is so small that urea clathrate including CH4 cannot be formed under the present experimental condition.

Figure 3 Raman spectra
of the intramolecular C–C (∼995 cm–1), C–N (∼1030 cm–1), and N–H
(3230–3450 cm–1) stretching
vibrations of C2H6 + urea binary system prepared
at (a) 197 MPa and 253 K, (b) 49.3 MPa and 253 K, (c) pure C2H6, and (d) pure solid urea. All the spectra were recorded
at 77 K and atmospheric pressure.

The pressure-induced structural phase transition, especially
in
the case of enclathrating a small guest molecule into the organic
inclusion compounds with a channel structure, has been reported. Hydroquinone
(HQ) has been recognized as one of them. The channel structure (α-HQ)
of HQ clathrate10 is transformed into the
cage structure (β-HQ) in the presence of an appropriate guest
molecule with pressurization.10−14 For example, α-HQ is transformed to β-HQ under the coexistence
of CH4 at 12 MPa for 5 days.13 To investigate the pressure effect of the C2H6/urea and C3H8/urea clathrates, we pressurized
the urea powder with C2H6 or C3H8 at a pressure of up to 200 MPa. Figure 3 shows the Raman spectra of the intramolecular
C–C (∼995 cm–1), C–N (∼1030
cm–1), and N–H (3230–3450 cm–1) stretching vibrations in the C2H6/urea clathrates
prepared at 253 K and 49.3 MPa (Figure 3b) and 197 MPa (Figure 3a). Raman spectra of the intramolecular C–N
and N–H stretching vibrations of urea are independent of pressure
up to 197 MPa. Also, Raman spectra of the intramolecular C–C
stretching vibration exhibited no significant pressure dependence,
whereas the relative intensity of C2H6 to urea
became large with increasing pressure. These results imply that there
is no structure phase transition of C2H6/urea
clathrate in a pressure range up to 200 MPa. Similarly, Raman spectra
of the intramolecular C–C (∼880 cm–1) and N–H (3230–3450 cm–1) stretching
vibrations of the C3H8/urea clathrates are independent
of pressure. As mentioned above, the CH4 + urea system,
unlike CH4 + HQ system, constructs no urea clathrate even
at 200 MPa. In the urea clathrate system including a small guest molecule,
no pressure-induced structural phase transition occurs, unlike HQ
clathrates. The channel structure of urea clathrates can withstand
higher pressure, compared with that of HQ clathrates.

The PXRD
patterns obtained in the present study are shown in Figure 4. The PXRD patterns
of the C2H6/urea, C3H6/urea, and C3H8/urea clathrates were coincident
with the main pattern of n-C8H18/urea clathrate. These results support the results from the Raman
spectra, that is, the C2H6, C3H6, and C3H8 molecules work as guest molecule
in urea clathrates with a hexagonal channel structure. The PXRD patterns
of C2H6/urea, C3H6/urea,
and C3H8/urea clathrates contained the profiles
derived from solid urea and solid guest molecules. And those of n-C8H18/urea clathrate also contained
the profiles derived from solid methanol and solid n-C8H18. Table 1 summarizes the space group and the lattice constants
of C2H6/urea, C3H6/urea,
C3H8/urea, n-C8H18/urea, and n-C7H16/urea clathrates. The lattice constants of C2H6/urea, C3H6/urea, and C3H8/urea clathrates are similar to the literature value8 of n-C7H16/urea
clathrate. Regardless of the guest size and shape, even in the case
of using a small guest molecule, these lattice constants indicate
that the urea clathrate including a straight-chain hydrocarbon has
similar hexagonal structure. Considering the present results (C2H6, C3H6, and C3H8 enclathration as a guest molecule in urea clathrate)
with the known properties (well selectivity of straight-chain alkanes)
of urea clathrate, the hexagonal urea clathrate would have potential
for gas separation media.

2.2 Urea
Clathrate Formation in the Saturated
Methanol Solution of Urea
Figure 5 shows the Raman spectra corresponding to
the N–H stretching vibrations of urea and the C–H stretching
vibrations of the guest molecule in the CH4 + urea + methanol,
C2H6 + urea + methanol, C3H6 + urea + methanol, and C3H8 + urea + methanol
ternary systems accompanied by those of the n-C8H18/urea clathrate and pure solid urea. Raman spectra
corresponding to the O–H and C–H stretching vibrations
derived from both unreacted and/or incorporated methanol are also
included in Figure 5. Every spectrum was measured at the same condition (atmospheric
pressure and 77 K). As is the case in the guest + urea binary systems
(without methanol, Figure 1), the Raman spectra of urea in the C2H6 + urea + methanol, C3H6 + urea + methanol,
C3H8 + urea + methanol systems shown in Figure 5b–d, respectively,
are similar to those of n-C8H18/urea clathrate shown in Figure 5e. That is, the C2H6, C3H6, and C3H8 molecules work as guest
molecule in the urea clathrate with a hexagonal channel structure
even in the presence of methanol. The presence of methanol does not
prevent the urea molecules from forming urea clathrate, different
from the results of the C3H8 + urea + methanol
system in the literature.9

Figure 5 Raman spectra of the
C–H, O–H, and N–H stretching
vibrations of (a) CH4 + urea + methanol ternary system
at 193 MPa, (b) C2H6 + urea + methanol ternary
system at 12.0 MPa, (c) C3H6 + urea + methanol
ternary system at 12.7 MPa, and (d) C3H8 + urea
+ methanol ternary system at 42.5 MPa, (e) n-C8H18/urea clathrate, (f) pure solid urea, and (g)
pure methanol. The samples (a)–(c) and (d) were prepared at
253 and 300 K for a couple of days, respectively. All the spectra
were recorded at 77 K and atmospheric pressure.

In the case of using CH4 as a guest molecule,
the Raman
spectrum as shown in Figure 5a is completely different from the spectra of urea clathrates
(Figure 5b–d)
as well as those of pure solid urea (Figure 5f) and the CH4 + urea binary system
(without methanol, Figure 2a). The Raman peak corresponding to the C–H stretching
vibration of CH4 in the newly formed urea compound was
very weak or not detected because it is difficult to distinguish from
the C–H vibrations of methanol. To confirm what kind of structure
the newly formed urea compound has, the additional two samples were
prepared from the saturated methanol solution of urea pressurized
with hydrogen (H2) and just from the saturated methanol
solution of urea without pressurization. The Raman spectra and PXRD
profiles are shown in Figures 6 and 7, respectively. In spite of pressurization
with H2, the Raman spectra similar to that in the CH4 + urea + methanol ternary system were detected. The very
weak Raman peaks of H2 vibration in the urea complex of
the H2 + urea + methanol ternary system are detected at
4110 and 4144 cm–1 (not shown). The PXRD profiles
suggest that the newly formed urea complex is different from the hexagonal
urea clathrate, although the crystal structure could not be identified.
The present results reveal that the newly formed urea complex including
H2 and CH4, which seems to have neither channel-
nor cage-like structure, would not be appropriate for the gas storage
material like HQ clathrates.13,14

C–H, O–H, and N–H stretching
vibrations of (a) urea + methanol (without pressurization), (b) H2 + urea + methanol ternary system at 82.9 MPa and 253 K, (c)
pure urea, and (d) pure methanol. All spectra were recorded at 77
K and atmospheric pressure.

and (e) pure methanol. All patterns were recorded at 153 K and atmospheric
pressure.

2.3 What
is the Role and Effect of Methanol?
To investigate the effect
of methanol on the stability of urea
clathrate, we have adopted C3H8 as a small guest
molecule. The thermodynamic stability boundaries of the C3H8/urea clathrate with and without methanol are shown
in Figure 8. In the
case of coexistence with the methanol solution phase, the stability
boundary of the C3H8/urea clathrate was shifted
to the lower temperature (higher pressure) side. That is, C3H8/urea clathrate in the C3H8 +
urea binary system is thermodynamically more stable than C3H8/urea clathrate coexisting with the methanol solution
phase. These results revealed that methanol as an auxiliary solvent
is not always necessary for C3H8/urea clathrate
formation. Rather, instead of methanol solution, the use of liquefied
propane phase leads to high stability of C3H8/urea clathrate.

Figure 8 Effect of methanol on the thermodynamic stability of C2H6/urea clathrate.

Considering the kinetics of the urea clathrate formation,
methanol
plays an important role in accelerating the formation of urea clathrate. Table 2 shows how high pressure
was required for the C2H6/urea clathrate formation
in the different preparation way with and without methanol. Within
6 days after pressurizing the saturated methanol solution of urea
with liquefied C2H6 at a pressure of up to 12.0
MPa and 253 K, C2H6/urea clathrate was formed.
In the case without methanol, C2H6/urea clathrate
was formed neither at 17.9 MPa nor 40.1 MPa (253 K for 6 days). The
pressure of more than ∼50 MPa is needed for C2H6/urea clathrate formation. That is, methanol solution plays
a role in decreasing the activation energy of urea clathrate formation,
but the solubility of urea in methanol makes urea clathrates thermodynamically
unstable. These results also indicate that the solubility of urea
is one of the most important factors in utilizing urea clathrates.
Urea clathrate should be prepared in methanol solution. After preparation,
the methanol solution of urea should be drained from urea clathrate.

The conventional preparation method of a urea clathrate is the
addition of the guest molecule in a saturated methanol solution of
urea.1 Generally, methanol is not enclathrated
in urea clathrate and acts as an auxiliary solvent to dissolve solid
urea. As mentioned above, it has been reported that the presence of
methanol prevents the urea molecules from forming C3H8/urea clathrate. In the present study, to investigate the
effect of methanol on urea clathrate formation, urea clathrate was
prepared without or with methanol. In the case without methanol, the
urea powder loaded in the high-pressure cell made of stainless steel
was directly pressurized with the guest molecule (CH4,
C2H6, C3H6, and C3H8) up to the desired pressure at 253 K (maximum
pressure is 200 MPa). The samples were placed in a deep freezer (Panasonic,
MDF-137-PJ) at 253 K for a couple of days. The cell was immersed in
liquefied nitrogen (at 77 K) until the sample temperature reached
77 K and then the sample was taken out at the atmospheric pressure
and kept at 77 K. In the case with methanol, the saturated methanol
solution of urea prepared at 298 K was loaded instead of urea powder.
The subsequent procedure is the same as above.

For the Raman
spectroscopy and PXRD, the sample was grained with
the mortar and pestle immersed in liquid nitrogen. A laser Raman microprobe
spectrometer with a multichannel CCD detector (JASCO, NRS-1000) was
used. The diode pumped solid state (DPSS) laser (Cobolt, Fandango)
was irradiated to the samples at atmospheric pressure and 77 K. The
backscatter was taken in with same lens. The wavelength of the DPSS
laser was 514.5 nm and the output power was adjusted to 100 mW. The
spectral resolution of the obtained Raman spectra was approximately
1 cm–1. The crystal structure of the prepared samples
was analyzed by PXRD. The PXRD patterns were measured at 153 K and
atmospheric pressure by use of a diffractometer (Rigaku, model Ultima
IV) with a Rigaku D/teX ultrahigh-speed position sensitive detector
and Cu Kα X-ray (40 kV, 50 mA). The PXRD measurements were performed
in the stepscan mode with scan rate of 4° min–1 and step size of 0.02°.

4 Conclusions
By means
of Raman spectroscopy and PXRD, the formation of urea
clathrates including C2H6, C3H6, and C3H8 as guest molecule has been
revealed. The thermodynamic stability of urea clathrates depends on
the guest molecules. The crystal structure of the formed urea clathrates
is similar to the hexagonal channel structure of the well-known urea
clathrate with n-C8H18 and n-C7H16. The smallest limit of the
guest molecule for the urea clathrate formation is laid between the
sizes of CH4 and C2H6. The enclathration
of CH4 to the urea clathrate is difficult even at 200 MPa.
No pressure-induced phase transition from the original channel structure
to a cage-like structure occurs at pressures up to 200 MPa. That is,
although the guest molecule is much shorter than the lattice constant
of the c-axis of the hexagonal channel structure,
the urea clathrates including C2H6, C3H6, and C3H8 have a fairly rigid
structure against compression.

Some researchers had believed
that methanol is necessary for urea
clathrate formation. The present results reveal that methanol is not
always necessary. Methanol has two different roles: thermodynamic
inhibitor of urea clathrate stability and kinetic promoter of urea
clathrate formation. In the case without an appropriate guest molecule
for urea clathrates, methanol forms an unknown complex with urea.
The methanol–urea complex would have little ability to store
CH4 and H2.
