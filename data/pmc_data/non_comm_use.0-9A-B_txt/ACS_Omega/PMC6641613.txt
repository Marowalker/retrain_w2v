Inorganic–organic hybrid mesoporous
silica thin films with
covalently bonded carboxylic acid groups were synthesized in a one-step
procedure, using carboxylic-derivatized alkoxysilanes obtained by
photochemical radical thiol-ene addition (PRTEA). The organosilanes
were synthesized by clicking mercaptosuccinic or mercaptoacetic thioacids
with vinyltrimethoxysilane, using benzophenone as the photoradical
initiator. The films were synthesized by evaporation-induced self-assembly
of a sol containing a mixture of tetraethoxysilane and different quantities
of the organosilanes, without any further treatment after the PRTEA
reaction. Two nonionic surfactants were used as templates to produce
different pore sizes. Different aging times were also applied. Structural
characterization with electron microscopy, porosimetry measurements,
and small angle X-ray scattering with two-dimensional detection demonstrated
the obtention of mesoporous phases whose degree of ordering depended
on the amount of added organosilane. The incorporation of the functional
silanes was shown by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and the presence
of the COOH groups was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR).
Finally, the availability of the COOH groups for further chemical
modification was demonstrated by FTIR by following the changes in
the typical carbonyl IR bands during proton exchange and metal complexation.
The proposed simple methodology allows obtaining COOH-modified silica
thin films in one step, without the need of hard reaction conditions
or deprotection steps. Functionalization with carboxyl groups brings
a pH-dependent switch-ability to the pore surface that can be used
for multifunctional mesoporous materials design.

Introduction
Oxide-based mesoporous
hybrid materials (MHMs) display large surface
areas and tunable pore sizes of mesoporous materials, mechanical and
thermal stabilities of an inorganic support, and chemical flexibility
of organic moieties. In particular, the organic molecules included
within the oxide give rise to a complex chemical behavior and provide
a means to tailor the pore surface properties, including hydrophobicity
and polarity, and catalytic, optical, and electronic characteristics.
Thus, MHMs carry the potential for many applications including catalysis,
chemical sensing, adsorption, contaminant immobilization, and drug
or gene delivery.1−3 MHMs in the form of thin films are particularly interesting
because they can be easily removed from reaction media and they can
be prepared onto a wide variety of surfaces, allowing the easy production
of devices.4

The incorporation of
organic functionalities within porous oxides
has attracted increasing attention since the beginning of the development
of mesoporous materials’ synthesis. Mainly, two grafting routes
are commonly used: postgrafting (postfunctionalization) or co-condensation
(one-step approach).3,5 In the first case, the functionality
is grafted to the material after consolidation of the mesostructure
through vapor deposition or solution impregnation. The modification
is established through the generation of new bonds between Si–OH
or M–OH surface groups and the functionalization agent. The
co-condensation method involves the mixing of inorganic precursors
with a precursor that bears the organic functionality in the presence
of the template; organosilanes are generally used for this approach.
Because the mesostructuration and functionalization takes place simultaneously,
a portion of the introduced organic groups remains trapped inside
the network, thus hindering their accessibility to the medium. Nevertheless,
the convenience of the co-condensation method is supported by the
reduced number of required processing steps, homogeneous distribution
of functional groups within the inorganic network, and reduced pore
clogging.

Diverse organic moieties, including mercaptoalkyl,
aminoalkyl,
phenyl, glycidyl, vinyl, cyanoalkyl, and alkyl groups, just to name
a few, have been incorporated onto the pore surface of MHMs, imparting
new chemical properties to the pores.6,7 Functionalization
with carboxylic groups, however, has been less explored when compared
with other functional groups. This is due to the lack of suitable
commercial reagents and the need for two-step procedures. The functionalization
with carboxyl groups brings a pH-dependent switch-ability to the pore
surface, whose adsorption capability or catalytic activity can be
varied by changing the solution acidity. Needless to mention, there
is a possibility of anchoring of biomolecules, such as proteins, antibodies,
or folic acid. In addition, COOH can also be used as a ligand for
metal complexation in decontamination or detection processes.8−10 Nevertheless, several methodologies have been described to achieve
the incorporation of the COOH group into silica powders (SBA-15, MCM
type, SiO2 nanoparticles) by co-condensation or postgrafting.10 These strategies include: modification of a
NH2-functionalized surface with succinic acid, co-condensation
or postgrafting with an aqueous solution of carboxyethylsilanetriol,
or grafting of an organosilane bearing an ester group that gives rise
to free carboxylic moiety after a hydrolysis step.10 Another possible approach is the use of cyanide to carboxylic
methods, wherein the COOH group is obtained after hydrolysis of the
−CN group with sulfuric acid using hard experimental conditions:
high temperature and long reaction times.10 Interestingly, the incorporation of COOH groups into mesoporous
thin films has been barely reported. Liu et al.11 have shown successful incorporation of carboxylic groups
into mesoporous thin films through a co-condensation method, applying
the cyanide to carboxylic conversion in a two-step method. However,
the lack of literature examples on the direct incorporation of COOH
functional groups in mesoporous films is due to the limited commercial
availability of carboxyethylsilanetriol sodium salt (available only
as a water base solution), being an incompatible precursor in evaporation-induced
self-assembly (EISA).12 In particular,
the EISA approach requires low water concentrations to both control
the sol–gel reaction and to allow fast evaporation of the sol
during film drying. Therefore, there is an obvious lack of reported
methods that allowed the incorporation of the COOH functional group
into mesoporous thin films using one step approaches.

In earlier
studies, we have reported the synthesis of organosilanes
bearing deprotected carboxylic acids in their structure by photochemical
radical thiol-ene addition (PRTEA), which were used without any purification
for the modification of mesoporous silica SBA-15 powder by the postfunctionalization
approach.9 PRTEA is a simple organic reaction,
wherein a thiyl radical is added to a double bond connecting two construction
blocks through a thioether bond, a click-based modular reaction based
on the click-chemistry concept introduced by Sharpless,8,13,14 offering simplicity and good
conversions. As a consequence, this reaction has generated much interest
in the area of materials science in the last few years, both for surface
modification and for precursor synthesis.8

In this work, we present the direct and unprotected incorporation
of COOH moieties in mesoporous hybrid thin films, by a one-step co-condensation
approach. The incorporation of the functional group was achieved by
reaction between tetraethoxysilane and two different carboxylated
alkoxysilanes obtained by PRTEA, using the click reaction product
without the need of any purification or deprotection step. The hybrid
films were obtained by EISA using two templating agents and different
proportions of the modified silanes. Characterization of the obtained
films demonstrated that the material displays a mesoporous structure
decorated with COOH groups that remain accessible for further chemical
reactions in all studied cases.

Results and Discussion
Two different alkoxysilane-bearing carboxylic moieties, one with
a short alkyl chain and one dicarboxylated, were synthesized by PRTEA;9 the reaction pathway is presented in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Reaction Pathway
To Obtain the COOH-Modified Silanes by PRTEA
To prepare the sols, the reaction mixture was used without
any
purification after completing the click coupling. Different amounts
(from 5 up to 20% in molar proportion) of each of the two carboxylated
precursors were mixed with tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS), ethanol,
a template, and acidic water. To control the pore-sized nonionic surfactants,
F127 and Brij 58 were used as templates. Additionally, the sol aging
time was varied in the range of 1–24 h. Samples were named
taking into account the template used (F for F127 and B for Brij 58),
the carboxylic acid included in the inorganic framework (mercaptosuccinic
acid (MSA)-derived silane and mercaptoacetic acid (MAA)-derived silane),
its theoretical molar percentage, and the sol’s aging time.
For example, SiB-MSA 5% 1 h sample refers to a thin film, including
the mercaptosuccinic acid function with x = 0.05,
Brij 58 as the template, and 1 h of aging after the sol preparation.
Samples without organic functions (x = 0) are denoted
as SiF and SiB. See Table S1 for complete
information about the studied systems.

All organosilica thin
films were obtained by dip coating over glass
substrates, taking advantage of the EISA approach.12 All films presented an excellent optical quality, were
well adhered to the substrate and were transparent in the visible
region. The films’ thicknesses were in the 250–300 nm
range, as determined by ellipsometry. This parameter can be easily
varied by changing the dip-coating rate.

Structural Characterization
To fully understand the
influence of the sol composition on the structural features of oxides,
all samples were characterized after template extraction by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) and small-angle X-ray scattering with two
dimensional detection (2D-SAXS), the ideal method to assign the porous
structure of mesoporous thin films.15 Representative
images and diffraction patterns are presented in Figures 1 and S1.

Figure 1 TEM and 2D-SAXS patterns of: (a) SiB-MSA 5% 1 h, (b) SiF-MSA 5%
1 h, (c) SiB-MSA 20% 1 h, and (d) SiF-MSA 20% 1 h thin films.

In all tested conditions, porous
materials were obtained, as can
be seen in the TEM images. However, only the oxides with lower concentration
of organic silane showed a high degree of order, as observed by both
TEM and 2D-SAXS. In fact, for all samples containing 5% of organic
moiety, 2D-SAXS patterns can be assigned to a body-centered cubic Im3m pore array, oriented with the (110)
plane parallel to the substrate. This structure is usually obtained
when F127 and Brij 58 are used as templates and is the same structure
observed for the samples without organic function.16 A further increase of the COOH-modified silane incorporation
(to 12.5 and 20%) affected the order of the structure. For F127-templated
oxides, the 2D-SAXS patterns were ellipses, which correspond to locally
ordered (wormlike) arrays of mesopores. Although TEM images demonstrate
that Brij 58-templated samples are porous (Figure 1C, as an example), in 2D-SAXS measurements,
no pattern was observed.

Our observation agrees with previous
studies17 that show that the presence of
organic functions
generally limits the organosilane/silane molar ratio in which an ordered
structure is obtained, being 20% of the organic function the most
usual limit.3,6,7 Aging
up to 24 h has no effect on the observed behavior, being the high
acidity of the initial sol a possible explanation for it.11

Regarding the plane’s distances
obtained from 2D-SAXS patterns,
it is interesting to note that the d1̅10 distance (the distance between pores for the cubic structure in
the xy plane) decreases when the amount of organic
function in the films increases, as can be seen as an example for
the SiF-MSA case in Table 1.

These results could indicate that
the diameter of micelles decreases
with the increase of concentration of the organic function, resulting
in smaller interpore distances. This tendency hints to a concentration-dependent
interaction between the templates and the organic moiety, affecting
the size of the micelles and ultimately of the pores, which are built
using the micelles as templates. A similar tendency has been observed
for cetyltrimethylammonium bromide-templated chloropropylsilane-modified
silica,18 but there are no reports for
nonionic templates such as the ones presented in this work. We postulate
that the interaction of the COOH moieties with the hydrophilic portion
of the templates diminishes the hydration of the micelles; thereby,
their size decreases.19 More detailed experiments
are being conducted to shed light on this point, also taking into
the
account the possibility of a decrease in the wall’s thicknesses
that can lead to the same observed tendency.

Next, to demonstrate
the availability of the porous structure,
we performed environmental ellipsometric porosimetry (EEP) measurements.
This technique is useful to determine accessible porosity and pore
sizes in mesoporous thin films because the measurement can be performed
directly, without detaching the sample from the substrate.20 Isotherms obtained by EEP, presented in Figure 2, show the typical
hysteresis loop of mesoporous materials. From the isotherms’
analysis,20 it can be concluded that the
films presented an accessible porosity of ∼20% and pore diameters
of ∼4 and ∼2 nm for F127 and Brij 58, respectively (Table 2). These values are
in agreement with previously obtained results for mesoporous thin
films that were treated at moderate temperatures, followed by template
extraction using organic solvents. This treatment results in less
deformed and interconnected pores, which means that pore sizes are
smaller and that films are less porous, compared with the ones that
are calcined.21,22

(b) SiB-MSA 20% 24 h thin
films.

Knowing
the final chemical composition and speciation of the organic
groups incorporated within the hybrid films is critical for understanding
the material’s final properties and potentialities. These results
are particularly important for the case of MHMs prepared by the co-condensation
methodology because the chance of the organic function’s degradation
due to thermal treatment is high. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) measurements were performed to determine the chemical composition.
As expected, the survey XPS spectra of all hybrid films analyzed showed
the presence of Si, O, C, and S, indicating the successful incorporation
of carboxylated silanes. Figure 3a shows, as an example, the wide scan spectrum for
the SiB-MSA 20% system. All spectra show the Si 2p signal at around
103 eV. From the high-resolution spectra, it can be observed that
the samples containing 12.5 and 20% of the carboxilated silanes show
the presence of two peaks at 164.2 and 168.6 eV (Figure 3b), whereas the films with
5% only show the peak at 168.6 eV (Figure 3c). The binding energy at ∼164.2 eV
can be assigned to −C–S–23 and the one at ∼168.6 eV can be associated to the oxidized
sulfur species −C–SOx–C–.23 The oxidation of S was observed in every sample;
this observation could be due to the thermal treatment performed in
the presence of oxygen.

Figure 3 XPS spectra (a) wide scan for SiB-MSA 20% 1
h system; detailed
scan in the S and Si region for SiB-MSA 20% 1 h system (b) and SiB-MSA
5% 1 h system (c).

The XPS survey also gives
the content of S and Si in the samples,
which can be related to the proportion of carboxylated organosilane
incorporated into the films. Because each carboxilated silane molecule
contains only one sulfur atom per silicon, the nominal ratio S/Si
in sols should be maintained in the films. From atomic percentages
obtained from the XPS survey of the films, an experimental ratio between
S and Si can be calculated. Results are presented in Table 3. The results show that the
increase in the fraction of functionalized silane leads to increase
in the final amount of sulfur in the hybrid film. In addition, regardless
of the type of sample, the final composition of the functionalizing
agent in the film corresponds to ∼30% of the nominal composition
in the solution. This behavior is presumably due to the degradation
of silane during the thermal treatment (200 °C) and/or the template
extraction. The effect of sol aging is ruled out as a potential cause
of degradation, because the binding energy for the sulfur species
and functional silane incorporation in the final material is equivalent
for different aging times, indicating that silane remains stable for
at least 24 h. This lack of effect is coincident with the conservation
of order type, pore sizes, and porosities during aging, as demonstrated
previously.

Finally, infrared
spectroscopy was used to qualitatively analyze
the presence and reactivity of COOH groups. Figure 4 shows, as an example, diffuse reflectance
infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFT) spectra of selected
MSA-modified samples after template extraction, compared to those
of unmodified films.

SiF-MSA 20% 1 h after contact with Pb2+. Left: wide spectra.
Right: enlargement of the COOH region.

The IR spectrum of SiF-MSA 20% 1 h (Figure 4b) shows the presence of characteristic signals
of the carbonyl group, which is absent in the SiF film (Figure 4a): a shoulder band at 1716
cm–1, associated to the carbonyl group’s
asymmetric mode of the carboxylic acid (νC=O) protonated form, and another band at lower wavenumber (∼1578
cm–1).24 Both bands superimpose
the band of adsorbed water (scissoring of OH groups). The lower wavenumber
band can be attributed to C=O stretching of the acidic groups
that interact by hydrogen bonding with chemical species on the oxide
surface, as Tsai et al. have previously observed by magic angle spinning
NMR in powders,25 or to the ionized form
of the carboxylic acid.26,27 Besides the bands associated
to COOH groups, the spectra shows the characteristics bands corresponding
to the O–Si–O stretching (TO, TO2, and TO3 modes) of the silica network28 at 1300–950 and 800 cm–1 zones and the
Si–OH band at 850 cm–1. Also, the stretching
vibration bands corresponding to the aliphatic skeleton of silane
and some residue of the template (νC–H) are
exhibited at 2954, 2927, and 2858 cm–1.

Similar
results are obtained for the films containing MAA and/or
templated with Brij58 (Figures S2 and S3): COOH related bands are present together with silica skeleton ones.
However, it is worth noting that the way the samples are prepared
for transmission IR measurements (scratching the film vs preparing
the film directly onto a KBr pellet) can affect the relation of the
intensities between the two bands attributed to the COOH group probably
due to the difference in the films’ thicknesses and accessibility.

The shifting and intensity of C=O bands can be used to evaluate
the reactivity of COOH/COO– groups toward simple
reactions, such as acid–base or metal complexation. Note, however,
that as the films were obtained by the co-condensation method, not
all carboxylic groups were available on the pore surface. When SiF-MSA
20% film was exposed to HCl vapors (Figure 4c), the intensity of the band located at
1716 cm–1 increased with the concomitant disappearance
of the band located at ∼1578 cm–1, indicating
that a fraction of the COOH groups are involved in acid–base
equilibrium.24 Immediately after, this
film was immersed in 0.4 mM Pb2+ aqueous solution. The
spectrum (Figure 4d)
shows a decrease in the intensity of the band located at 1716 cm–1 and the appearance of a distinctive band at 1550
cm–1 that is associated with coordinated carboxylic
groups.24,26,27 Moreover,
it can be seen that the 850 cm–1 band associated
with Si–OH does not suffer any changes after contact with acidic
or Pb(II) solutions (Figure 4c,d). This indicates, as expected on the basis of previous
results,9 that the acidity and ion exchange
due to the bare silica matrix are negligible when compared to those
due to the COOH groups, under these experimental conditions. Thus,
these simple acid–base and coordination experiments show that
the included carboxylic groups are available for simple chemical reactions
such as proton interchange or Pb(II) ion trapping.

Summary and Conclusions
In this work, we have presented the direct incorporation of readily
available COOH groups to mesoporous silica thin films by the co-condensation
method. Two different carboxylated organosilanes obtained by PRTEA
were used, demonstrating the easiness of this reaction and the versatility
of the chosen protocol to incorporate organic functions. Moreover,
the two different templates (F127 and Brij 58) used in the process
showed identical successful results.

Structural characterization
demonstrated the generation of mesoporous
phases whose degree of ordering depends on the amount of added organosilanes.
In particular, low organosilane concentrations give rise to body-centered
cubic mesoporous ordering, whereas higher concentrations give rise
to locally ordered structures. The incorporation of functional silanes
was clearly demonstrated by XPS, showing that around 30% of the nominal
organosilane concentration is incorporated within the films.

The presence of COOH groups on the pore surface was confirmed by
infrared spectroscopy alongside with its availability for further
chemical modification. Clear changes in the typical carbonyl signals
during proton interchange and metal complexation experiments were
observed, indicating that chemical reactions can be performed on the
modified mesoporous structure.

The proposed simple methodology
allows the synthesis of COOH-modified
silica thin films in one step, without the need of hard reaction conditions
or deprotection steps. Moreover, as the material is obtained as a
thin film, it can be easily incorporated in reaction media and/or
integrated into devices. As COOH groups are expected to serve as binding
sites for more complex molecules, such as proteins, enzymes, or ions,
the presented results pave the way toward applications of such COOH-modified
films, for example, as sensors or drug-delivery devices.

Experimental
Section
Materials
TEOS (98%), vinyltrimethoxysilane (VTMS,
98%), mercaptoacetic acid (MAA, 97%), 2-mercaptosuccinic acid (MSA,
97%), benzophenone (Ph2CO, 99%), Brij 58, and Pluronic
F127 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Hydrochloric
acid (37%), Pb(NO3)2, and methanol were purchased
from Merck. Methanol, pure grade ethanol, and Milli-Q water were used
as solvents. Methanol was dried over activated MS-3 Å before
use.

Synthesis of Carboxylic Trialkoxysilane Precursors
2-((2-(Trimethoxysilyl)ethyl)thio)succinic acid ((MeO)3Si-MSA) and 2-((2-(trimethoxysilyl)ethyl)thio)acetic acid ((MeO)3Si-MAA) were prepared, as previously reported.9 Briefly, 1 equiv of VTMS was added to a vial containing
methanol solution of the desired amount of MSA or MAA (chosen according
to the desired proportion of organic function in the final material,
see below) and 0.15 equiv of Ph2CO as the photoinitiatior
(Scheme 1). Reaction
solutions were then irradiated under gentle stirring for 16 h, using
a 15 W, 18” long black-light lamp (λmax =
352 nm). The precursor’s reaction mixture was used without
any further treatment in the preparation of the sols.

Preparation
of Hybrid Mesoporous Thin Films
Hybrid
sols were prepared in three steps: (1) TEOS, ethanol, and the template
(Brij 58 or F127) were mixed; (2) the reaction mixture of thio-ene
addition was added drop wise under stirring; and (3) HCl solution
was added drop wise under stirring. The chosen order allows the correct
co-condensation reaction between the two silanes. The theoretical
molar proportions of the sols were TEOS/Si-R/template/HCl/EtOH/H2O = 1 – x:x:s:0.28:24:5.2,
with 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2, R = MSA or MAA, and s = 0.005 for F127 or s = 0.05 for Brij
58. After its preparation, the sol was aged for different times in
the 1–24 h range.

Hybrid mesoporous Si1–x(SiR)xO2 films
were synthesized by dip coating, taking advantage of the EISA approach.12 A withdrawal speed of 3 mm s–1 was used to deposit the films onto glass slides. Immediately after
synthesis, the films were placed in a humidity-controlled chamber
at 50% relative humidity (obtained with a saturated Ca(NO3)2 solution in water) and kept there for 24 h. Afterward,
they were submitted to a gentle thermal treatment: 24 h at 60 °C,
24 h at 130 °C, and 2 h at 200 °C. Finally, the template
was extracted by immersing the films for 2 days in pure grade ethanol.

Characterization
2D-SAXS patterns were obtained at
the Austrian SAXS beamline at the Elettra synchrotron (Trieste, Italy),
using a 1.54 Å (8 keV) incidence X-ray beam.29 The sample was placed at 82.88 cm from a pixel detector
(Pilatus 1M) on a rotation stage, which allowed to set the glancing
angle between the incident radiation and the sample to 3°. The
samples were prepared onto coverslips to allow measurements in Laue
geometry. The angular scale of the detector was calibrated with Ag-behenate
as the reference pattern.

Pores were visualized by TEM using
a JEOL JEM-1400PLUS microscope equipped with a Gatan US1000 CCD camera.
Samples were prepared by dropping pure ethanol on carbon-coated copper
grids and depositing the powder obtained after scratching the films.

The atomic composition of the films was determined by XPS, with
a SPECS Sage HR 100 spectrometer equipped with a 100 mm mean radius
PHOIBOS analyzer and a nonmonochromatic X-ray source (Mg Kα
line of 1253.6 eV energy and 250 W), placed perpendicular to the analyzer
axis and calibrated using the 3d5/2 line of Ag, with a
full width at half maximum of 1.1 eV. The selected resolution for
high resolution spectra was 15 eV of pass energy and 0.15 eV per step.
All measurements were made in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber at a pressure
of around 8 × 10–8 mbar. An electron flood
gun was used to neutralize for charging. Measurements were conducted
directly on the films, which were previously washed with absolute
ethanol and cut into samples of 1 cm × 1 cm. The analysis of
spectra was done with CasaXPS 2.3.15dev87 software. Satellite removal
and Shirley background subtraction were applied, the binding energies
were calibrated assigning to the C 1s C–C peak 285 eV, and
peaks were fitted with Gaussian–Lorentzian line shapes to determine
the atomic percentages of elements present in the films. To calculate
the atomic ratio between sulfur and silicon, three different films
of each system were measured.

Ellipsometric and EEP measurements
were performed in a SOPRA GES5A
ellipsometer, using samples previously washed with absolute ethanol
and dried. Film thickness and refractive index values were obtained
from the ellipsometric parameters Ψ and Δ under dry air
flux containing variable water vapor pressure P; P/Po was varied from 0 to 1
(Po being the saturation water vapor pressure
at 25 °C). Water volume adsorbed at each P/Po value was determined by modeling the obtained
refractive index according to a three-component (water–air–oxide)
Bruggeman effective medium approximation. Adsorption–desorption
isotherms were obtained by plotting the water volume adsorbed by the
porous film at each P/Po. The pore size distribution was obtained from the isotherms using
the Kelvin equation, taking into account the water contact angle in
the film.20 Water contact angles required
for such calculations were determined using a Ramé-Hart 190
CA equipment.

FTIR spectroscopy and DRIFT measurements were
performed in a Nicolet
Magna 560 instrument, equipped with a liquid N2-cooled
MCT-A detector. For transmission measurements, a drop of each sol
was deposited onto a KBr pellet and treated in the same way as the
thin films. Measurements were made at different stages of the thermal
treatment. DRIFT measurements were performed by depositing scratched
films onto a KBr-filled sample holder. To observe the speciation and
accessibility of the COOH group in the inorganic network, the films
were dried for 10 min in a 130 °C oven and immediately after
scratched; the spectrum was taken immediately to minimize the water
adsorption from the environment. In the case of acidic treatment,
the films were set for 10 min in a chamber saturated with HCl vapor.
Then, the films were dried and scratched in a similar way, as with
the untreated films. For metal coordination studies, the films were
put in contact with a 0.4 mM Pb2+ aqueous solution for
5 min, washed with water and ethanol, dried, and then scratched.
