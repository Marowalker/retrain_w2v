The search for new therapies and
drugs that act as topical agents to relieve pain and control the inflammatory
processes in burns always attracted interest in clinical trials. As
an alternative to synthetic drugs, natural extracts are useful in
the development of new strategies and formulations for improving the
quality of life. The aim of this study was to develop a wound dressing
using poly(l-co-d,l-lactic
acid-co-trimethylene carbonate) (PLDLA-TMC) containing Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi (S.T.R.). S.T.R. is
a native Brazilian plant known for its strong anti-inflammatory responses.
The membrane of PLDLA-TMC + S. terebinthifolius Raddi was prepared at different concentrations of S.T.R. (5, 10,
15, and 50%). The Fourier transform infrared results showed no change
in the PLDLA-TMC spectrum after S.T.R. addition, whereas the swelling
test showed changes only in PLDLA-TMC + S.T.R. at 50%. The wettability
measurements showed a mass loss due to the decrease in the contact
angle in all samples after the S.T.R. addition in the polymer, whereas
the S.T.R. release test showed a linear delivery pattern. The scanning
electron microscopy analysis showed that S.T.R. was homogeneously
distributed at only 5 and 10%. Tensile tests demonstrated an increase
in Young’s modulus and a reduction in the elongation till rupture
of PLDLA-TMC after the addition of S.T.R. The biocompatibility in
vitro evaluation with rat fibroblast cells seeded in the membranes
of PLDLA-TMC + S.T.R. showed that although S.T.R. interfered in cell
morphology, all concentrations tested showed that cells were able
to adhere and proliferate during 7 days. Thus, S.T.R. at 50% was chosen
to be tested for in vivo trials. The histological and immunohistochemistry
results revealed an accelerated skin healing at 7 days after controlled
secondary burns were introduced in the dorsal skin, with a striking
total recovery of the epidermis and high rates of molecular activation
of cell proliferation. Due to the known biocompatibility properties
of PLDLA-TMC and its stable release of S.T.R., we strongly recommend
S.T.R.-containing PLDLA-TMC as a curative device to favor skin healing.

==== Body
Introduction
The skin acts as an important barrier
of protection, and lesions are often common, but depending on the
injury complexity, tissue destruction may occur due to coagulation,
denaturation of proteins, or ionization of cellular content leading
to tissue death. The skin rupture may lead to complications such as
liquid loss, which can generate severe dehydration and hypovolemia,
bloodstream infection, hypothermia, immunity weakness, scar formation,
edema, breathing problems, pain, and many other commitments.1,2 When skin damage is severe enough to induce some of those complications,
an effective therapy is mandatory to bring back its function and patient
self-esteem.3

The wound healing is
an important physiological process to restore the integrity of skin
after trauma, either by accident or even by an intent procedure. The
normal wound-healing process involves three successive overlapping
phases: hemostasis/inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. Some
aberrations of the wound-healing process, such as excessive wound
healing (hypertrophic scar and keloid) or chronic wound (ulcer), impair
the normal physical function.4,5

Biomaterials designed
to improve skin healing must possess mechanical and chemical properties
that could reconstitute, even partially, the skin function, but to
conduct the healing toward the regeneration, the bioengineered construct
should control the natural inflammation process in the course and
accelerate tissue proliferation and remodeling. Nowadays, a large
number of wound-care products are available commercially, like creams,
solutions, dressings, and even skin tissue-engineered substitutes.
Thus, dressings based on polymers act as an effective method for the
treatment of skin wounds, presenting a good ratio between the cost
and clinical benefits.6 In this direction,
the most applied polymers in the dressing manufacture are poly(glycolic),
poly(lactic acid) (PLA), poly(acrylic acid), poly(ε-caprolactone),
poly(vinylpyrrolidone), poly(vinyl alcohol), and poly(ethylene glycol).7 These polymers have already shown in vivo or
in vitro healing properties directed to favor epithelization of the
damaged area and induced cell adhesion and proliferation, respectively.8 However, among the polymers listed, one should
highlight the poly(lactic acid) (PLA). This polymer belongs to the
class of aliphatic polyester, a thermoplastic polymer that presents
ester bonds in the main chain, which makes it susceptible to degradation
by hydrolysis. Since lactic acid is a chiral molecule with two optically
active forms (l-lactic acid and d-lactic acid),
the polymerization of these monomers leads to the formation of two
different types of PLA. One of them is the poly(l-lactic
acid) and the other is poly(l-co-d,l-lactic acid) copolymer (PLDLA), which are semicrystalline
and amorphous polymers, respectively.9,10

Despite the good mechanical properties shown by the PLDLA, its application
as a wound dressing requires improved elasticity, once it is necessary
to be flexible enough to be molded on the injury skin. In this scenario,
to increase the tenacity and flexibility of the desired curative device,
trimethylene carbonate (TMC) was incorporated into the PLDLA.11 TMC is an aliphatic elastomer and when incorporated
into the PLDLA, the resulting polymer is turned flexible. Poly(l-co-d,l-lactic acid-co-TMC) (PLDLA-TMC) produced by our group is more flexible
than PLDLA according to the charge applied. To improve healing properties,
since the use of PLDLA-TMC as a polymeric dressing is not enough to
increase skin recovery, such as therapeutic qualities like antiseptic
or anti-inflammatory characteristics, PLDLA-TMC was added to the natural
plant extract of Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi (S.T.R.). Many studies have shown the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory,
antitumor, and antibacterial power of plants12,13 and, consequently, their use as a natural remedy for this purpose
is gaining attention in traditional medicine.14 S.T.R. is a plant that belongs to the Anacardiaceae family.15 Many research studies have evidenced the anti-inflammatory,
antimicrobial, and cicatrizing properties of S.T.R.15−18 These properties relate to the
presence of tannins and essential oils in both its branches and leaves,
whereas the tannins are the ones responsible for the cicatrizing action.
In addition, the presence of flavonoids in the bark of S.T.R. potentiates
this effect due to their anti-inflammatory action.19

Thus, the wound treatment attracts
a high level of attention and it is economically demanding to treat
extensive skin burns. Since the commercial skin dressing sold nowadays
is very expensive, limiting adequate treatment to only few people
who can pay for it, the aim is to produce a dressing based on PLDLA-TMC
with S. terebinthifolius Raddi powder
extract, which could prove to be of great commercial interest.

Materials
and Methods
Synthesis of PLDLA-TMC
Poly(l-co-d,l-lactic acid-co-trimethylene
carbonate) [PLDLA-TMC (50/50)] was synthesized in the Biomaterials
Laboratory at PUC-SP according to Motta and Duek.20 Appropriate amounts of l-lactide, d,l-lactide, and TMC (l/d,l/TMC = 35:15:50
w/w/w) were mixed and poured into glass ampoules. The molar ratio
of Stannous octoate (Sn(Oct)2) added to the monomer was
1:5000. After being sealed under vacuum, the ampoules were immersed
in an oil bath at 130 °C for 48 h. At the end of the reaction,
PLDLA-TMC was dissolved in chloroform and precipitated in methanol.
It was done to purify the PLDLA-TMC obtained. The terpolymer was dried
under vacuum for 8 h at 45 °C to eliminate the residual solvent.

Obtention of the S.T.R. Powder
The milled bark of S.T.R.
tree was purchased from Zé Franco Ervas Medicinais store, located
in the city of Sorocaba, SP, Brazil. The S.T.R. powder extract was
obtained by the percolation extraction method. The powder (250 g)
from the bark of S.T.R. was mixed with 70% ethanol (1:20, w/v) and
left standing for 1 h. Then, the mixture was transferred to a percolator.
The extraction was done at room temperature with a flow rate of 5
mL/h until the percolation was exhausted. Through the rotary evaporation
process, the solvent was removed; the humid extract obtained was dried
in a vacuum oven at 35 °C for 72 h.

Preparation of PLDLA-TMC
Membranes
PLDLA-TMC membranes impregnated with S.T.R. were
prepared by the solvent evaporation method. The concentration of the
polymer in these membranes was 10% (w/v) (polymer weight/solvent volume),
and the S.T.R. concentration varied from 0 (positive control), 5,
10, 20 to 50% (w/w) (polymer weight/S.T.R. weight). After complete
polymer solubilization in CHCl3, it was poured on a plate
inside a glass box saturated with chloroform for 12 h and dried at
room temperature. The samples were identified as PLDLA-TMC (as a positive
control and S.T.R. free), PLDLA-TMC + 5%S.T.R., PLDLA-TMC + 10%S.T.R.,
PLDLA-TMC + 20%S.T.R., and PLDLA-TMC + 50%S.T.R. (Table 1).

Table 1 Composition of the Membranes of PLDLA-TMC or with S.T.R.

PLDLA-TMC + 10%S.T.R.	7.0	0.7	0.070	
PLDLA-TMC + 20%S.T.R.	7.0	0.7	0.140	
PLDLA-TMC + 50%S.T.R.	7.0	0.7	0.350	
Thermal Analysis
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed under a nitrogen atmosphere
in a TGA 55 instrument (TA Instruments). Samples of approximately
10 mg were analyzed. Samples were heated from room temperature to
500 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min and a nitrogen gas
flow rate of 50 mL/min.

Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
The DSC analysis was performed with a DSC 250 instrument (TA Instruments).
DSC samples of approximately 10 mg were weighed and measured against
an empty pan as a reference. Measurements were carried out under a
80 mL/min nitrogen flow rate according to the following protocol:
first heating from 25 to 200 °C at 10 °C/min, first cooling
(quenching after first heating) from 200 to −30 °C at
50 °C/min and 2 min of isotherm, and second heating from −30
to 200 °C at 10 °C/min. In particular, the first heating
scan was used to erase any prior thermal history of the sample and
the second heating scan was used to evaluate glass temperature (Tg).

Swelling Test
All polymeric tests
were carried out under the same conditions. All specimens were cut
in 20 (l) × 10 (w) × 0.3
(t) mm3. The bath temperature and maximum
immersion time considered were 37 °C and 110 h, respectively.
The absorption measurements were done under immersion in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) at pH = 7.4. After removing the specimen from PBS, it
was dried to remove the surface moisture and weighed by a high-precision
analytical balance to evaluate the mass change during the swelling. The percentage of weight variation for each specimen was calculated
from its initial weight (w0) and its weight
after absorption (wt), as follows in eq 1 1  

S. terebinthifolius Raddi Release Test
The
release of S.T.R. was performed in a triplicate of membranes [30 (l) × 10 (w) × 0.3 (t) mm3] with different S.T.R. contents, submerged individually
in 4 mL of PBS at 37 °C. After 1 h of the start of the test,
the supernatant (2 mL) was removed and measured by a UV spectrophotometer
(Fento 800 XI) at 480 nm. All aliquots were rejected after each measurement,
and then new PBS was filled in each specimen after the reading point. The analysis was repeated once a day until day 8. The amount of S.T.R.
released was calculated from a standard curve containing a known content
of S.T.R.

Contact Angle Measurement
The wettability of the surfaces
was evaluated by measuring the static contact angles of polar liquid
(dH20) droplets on the membrane surface of each sample.
Contact angles were measured by a Rammé-Hart 100-00 goniometer.
The results were obtained as medians of eight measurements at four
random regions of the membranes.

Scanning Electron Microscopy
(SEM)
The surface of each sample was gold sputter-coated and analyzed by
SEM (JEOL JSM 6010) at an acceleration voltage of 3 kV under detector
of secondary electrons. Low-magnification images of the surface morphology
of each sample were evaluated.

Tensile Testing
The ASTM D 638 standards were used for all tensile tests. The Universal
Testing Machine (INSTRON EMIC 23–30) with tensile grips at
25 °C with a strain rate of 10 mm/min was configured for all
analyses executed. For each sample, tests were done in quadruplicate.

In Vitro Biocompatibility Tests
Rat fibroblast cells were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (Sigma-Aldrich)
was used for routine cell cultivation. When cells reached passages
between three and five, the assays were performed. Prior to the assays,
0.8 mm diameter rounded membranes were UV-C sterilized and soaked
in pure DMEM for 1 h in 48-well plates. The cell concentration of
2 × 104 per well was seeded in all of the membranes.
Cells were also seeded in Thermanox coverslips (Nunc Inc.) as a negative
control. The cellular proliferation and viability were evaluated after
1, 3, and 7 days. After this period, cells were subjected to fluorescence
live imaging by direct labeling of calcein green AM to identify live
cells and ethidium homodimer (Ethd-1) to identify the dead ones (Thermo
Scientific) by laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) (model TCS
SP8; Leica, Germany). Samples were observed in a photomultiplier tube
mode using a 488 nm laser line to detect emission signals in the range
of 500–540 nm.

In Vivo Assays
In this test, 30
Wistar rats of both sexes of approximately 3 months of age, raised
in the biotery of the Medical and Health Sciences Faculty at Pontifical
Catholic University of São Paulo (PUC-SP), under ethical committee
approval number 2016/61 were divided into three groups, according
to the treatment applied: a negative control group (only lesions without
a polymeric membrane), a positive control group (PLDLA-TMC membrane
only), and a membrane group containing 50% (w/w) of S.T.R. (PLDLA-TMC
+ 50%S.T.R.). The concentration of 50% (w/w) S.T.R. was chosen for
in vivo studies based on the previous in vitro assays. For each study
group, five animals were assigned, and the implants were analyzed
7 and 14 days after the surgical intervention (burn injury). After
implantation, animals were raised in individual cages until euthanization.
Surgeries were performed after neuromuscular blocking by ketamine/xylazine
anesthesia. After fur trichotomy on the region of interest (cervical
back near down calvaria), the burn injury was done in a skin area
of 4 cm2 (2 × 2 cm2). The skin was subjected
to burn for 10 s under water immersion at 70 °C. After the recovery
period, the animals were euthanized by halothane inhalation and the
skin lesion area was removed and fixed in formaldehyde at 10% and
processed for histology and immunohistochemistry. The early inflammatory
responses and tissue healing were investigated by antibody-peroxidase
labeling to identify granulocytic leukocytes (myeloperoxidase, MPO),
macrophages (CD68), and cellular proliferation (proliferating cell
nuclear antigen, PCNA).

Results and Discussion
Scanning Electron Microscopy
To verify the distribution and dispersion of S.T.R. in PLDLA-TMC,
the SEM analysis was conducted. Figure 1 shows the surface of PLDLA-TMC with different concentrations
of S.T.R.

Figure 1 Scanning electron microscopy images of the PLDLA-TMC surface containing
different concentrations of S.T.R.

The morphology of the PLDLA-TMC + S.T.R. surface showed subtle differences
among samples. The smooth and dense presentation of the PLDLA-TMC
matrix was changed by the presence of small tactoids of S.T.R. For
PLDLA-TMC + 5%S.T.R., the size of tactoids is smaller than for PLDLA-TMC
+ 50%S.T.R. For example, in the sample of PLDLA-TMC + 5%S.T.R., the
size of tactoids is smaller than in PLDLA-TMC + 50%S.T.R., i.e., as
the concentration of S.T.R. increases, the size of the tactoids also
increases. This is because high concentration of STR causes the agglomeration
of the fibers on the surface of PLDLA-TMC.21 The largest tactoid size observed for higher concentrations of S.T.R.
is due to the agglomeration of these particles when added to PLDLA-TMC.
This particle agglomeration occurs due to the hydrophilic characteristic
of S.T.R. particles and the hydrophobic characteristic of PLDLA-TMC.
Therefore, this difference in the polarity of the constituents causes
the difficulty to disperse the particles of S.T.R. by PLDLA-TMC.

Contact Angle Measurement
The contact angle (θ) measurement
was done to analyze the surface of PLDLA-TMC and PLDLA-TMC containing
the S.T.R. powder.

It is an interesting technique to verify
indirectly the distribution of the S.T.R. powder on the PLDLA-TMC
surface. Since PLDLA-TMC has a dense structure, it was important to
evaluate whether the S.T.R. powder was distributed on the polymer
surface, which would justify its use as an efficient wound dressing.
In Figure 2, it is
possible to observe that the contact angle changes according to time.
When comparing the contact angle value according to the time between
PLDLA-TMC and PLDLA-TMC with different contents of S.T.R., one can
note that PLDLA-TMC showed higher contact angle values among all samples
analyzed. This is related to the hydrophobic characteristics of PLDLA-TMC.
On the other hand, the presence of S.T.R. in PLDLA-TMC reduced the
contact angle value compared to that in PLDLA-TMC, causing the surface
of PLDLA-TMC to become more hydrophilic. This happened because the
S.T.R. powder shows a hydrophilic characteristic. Such a reduction
in θ value is remarkable since it proves that the S.T.R. powder
was scattered over the membrane surface. This is an intended characteristic
to develop an efficient dressing for S.T.R. delivery while in contact
with the wounded skin.

Figure 2 Contact angle measurements vs time.

In addition, despite adding higher concentrations of S.T.R., the
sample PLDLA-TMC + 50%S.T.R. did not show the lowest value of the
contact angle. Therefore, it could be an indication that at high concentrations
of S.T.R. there was an aggregation of S.T.R. particles. Thus, there
were not good distribution and dispersion of S.T.R. particles on the
PLDLA-TMC surface. On the other hand, PLDLA-TMC + 10%S.T.R. and PLDLA-TMC
+ 20%S.T.R. showed the smallest value of the contact angle. Thus,
it could be an indication that there were better distribution and
dispersion of S.T.R. particles on the PLDLA-TMC surface. Therefore,
the analysis of the measurement of the contact angle corroborated
with the SEM images. That is, the higher the concentrations of S.T.R.
added to PLDLA-TMC, the bigger the size of the tactoids formed due
to the aggregation of the S.T.R. particles on the PLDLA-TMC surface.

A number of studies have shown that moderate hydrophilicity favors
cell adhesion, growth, and spreading on such substrates as compared
to hydrophobic or strongly hydrophilic substrates. In this case, this
factor impairs changes in cell behavior for biomaterials, as already
demonstrated elsewhere.22

Swelling Test
This analysis evaluates how the wound dressing would behave when
put in contact with the exudate from the skin during its healing. Figure 3 shows the weight
change versus immersion time of samples in PBS at 37 °C.

Figure 3 Water uptake
(%) vs time (h) of the PLDLA-TMC membrane and the PLDLA-TMC membrane
with 5, 10, 20, and 50% of S.T.R. The early times up to 5 h are better
depicted in the upper-right graph.

PLDLA-TMC showed maximum PBS absorption until 3 h. After this period,
the PBS absorption by the PLDLA-TMC membrane became stable until completion
of the swelling test (110 h). According to Motta et al.,23 the weight stability of PLDLA-TMC is related
to the presence of TMC in the structure of PLDLA. Therefore, it is
possible to observe in the swelling test results that PLDLA-TMC does
not present a weight loss in a short period since TMC increases the
degradation time of PLDLA-TMC. Moreover, it was observed for a PLDLA-TMC
film that the water absorption and desorption pattern at room temperature
follows Fickian behavior where the water uptake process is linear
in the beginning and then slows and approaches saturation after a
prolonged time. Fickian diffusion refers to the spreading of water
from areas of higher to lower concentrations caused by the concentration
gradient.24

The PLDLA-TMC + 50%S.T.R.
showed the highest PBS absorption value (110.3%) compared to all samples
analyzed. This could be related to the hydrophilicity of S.T.R. particles
present on PLDLA-TMC since this sample has the highest concentration
of S.T.R. compared to all samples analyzed. However, PLDLA-TMC + 50%S.T.R.
began to lose weight faster than other samples. This could be related
to the presence of agglomerated (big) tactoids of S.T.R. on the surface
of PLDLA-TMC. Due to the contact of the samples
of PLDLA-TMC + S.T.R. with the PBS solution (aqueous medium) and the
temperature of 37 °C for 110 h, microcracks formed on the surface
and in the bulk of these samples, leading to peeling off and solubilization
of S.T.R. particles from the PLDLA-TMC surface into PBS solution.25 Thus, it may justify the weight lost by all
of the samples of PLDLA-TMC + S.T.R. since the beginning of the swelling
test. Moreover, the presence of such agglomerated (big) tactoids could
enable the faster release of S.T.R. particles in the solution than
other samples. Therefore, this swelling behavior could corroborate
with the SEM analysis and contact angle analysis.

In membranes with lower concentrations
of S.T.R. (5, 10, and 20%), a more restrained PBS absorption was observed
to occur in PLDLA-TMC. This slight increase of weight can be justified due to the simultaneous
occurrence of the absorption process of PBS solution and the release
of S.T.R. particles in the PBS solution, and in this case, the main
effect is the PBS gain by the samples with 5, 10, and 20% S.T.R. In
addition, at completion of the swelling test (110 h), these samples
with 5, 10, and 20% S.T.R. showed a decrease in the sample weight
when compared to the initial test time. Again, it could be related
to the release of S.T.R. particles in the PBS solution.

S.T.R. Release
Test
Figure 4 illustrates the release profile of S.T.R. from the PLDLA-TMC matrix
with different S.T.R. concentrations versus time (h). As shown in Figure 4, the concentration
of S.T.R. in PBS solution increases according to time. The release
of S.T.R. from PLDLA-TMC is related to the solubility of S.T.R. in
PBS solution (water medium) and to the swelling of PLDLA-TMC as it
is soaked in PBS solution. However, the sample with higher concentrations
of S.T.R. (PLDLA-TMC + 50%S.T.R.) showed a greater amount of S.T.R.
released during the test. Moreover, the PLDLA-TMC + 50%S.T.R. sample
showed a release rate of S.T.R. faster than other samples loaded with
minor concentrations of S.T.R. One can observe in Figure 4 that the release profile of
PLDLA-TMC + 50%S.T.R. shows a higher inclination as compared to all
other curves on the initial time of the release test. Such a greater
released value of S.T.R. and the faster release rate of S.T.R. of
PLDLA-TMC + 50%S.T.R. than those of other samples with 5, 10, and
20% of S.T.R. are related to the presence of S.T.R. tactoids in the
PLDLA-TMC + 50%S.T.R. These big tactoids can facilitate the easier
release of these particles in the PBS solution than other samples
with small S.T.R. tactoids (5, 10, and 20% S.T.R.). Therefore, according
to the swelling and release tests, the PLDLA-TMC + 50%S.T.R. could
be further a new dressing designed to control tissue repair since
S.T.R. release was faster than that of other samples.

from the PLDLA-TMC membrane.

Tensile Testing
To evaluate whether the wound-dressing membranes
containing S.T.R. presented desired mechanical properties to be used
as a skin dressing, the tensile assays were conducted. Therefore,
an ultimate wound bandage should possess desired mechanical properties
and preserve its integrity during use and management and it should
be highly flexible to easily adapt to the skin curves and movements.
The mechanical properties of pure PLDLA-TMC and with different contents
of S.T.R. were evaluated according to Young’s modulus and elongation
at break (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Young’s
modulus and elongation at break (%) vs PLDLA-TMC with different concentrations
of S.T.R.

The inclusion of S.T.R. within
the membrane of PLDLA-TMC influences significantly its mechanical
properties and generates a higher stiffness since there was an increase
in Young’s modulus (2.3 MPa for PLDLA-TMC and up to 17.8 MPa
for PLDLA-TMC + 50%S.T.R.) and a decline in the elongation at break
(2190.2% for PLDLA-TMC to 718.4% for PLDLA-TMC + 50%S.T.R.). When
PLDLA-TMC was filled with S.T.R., Young’s modulus augmented
and the elongation at break decreased for all S.T.R. concentrations
analyzed. Thus, the S.T.R. particles acted as a reinforcing filler
that enhanced the mechanical property of PLDLA-TMC. In this way, the
improvement in Young’s modulus of the membranes containing
S.T.R. may be attributed to the interaction between the PLDLA-TMC
matrix and the tactoids of S.T.R. that decreases the movement of macromolecules
in the PLDLA-TMC membrane.26 The decline of the polymer elongation after adding S.T.R. did not
invalidate its use as a bandage since the membrane still maintained
a significant deformation property and could adapt to body movements
and skin anatomy.

14.6, 14.2, 15.7, and 16.4 °C, respectively. Despite the difference
between Tg values of the PLDLA-TMC sample
and PLDLA-TMC with S.T.R. samples, these results were not significantly
different (P > 0.05). The P-value
obtained from the analysis of variance and the Tukey test was 0.8128,
which means that the mobility of the small segments of polymeric chains
was not significantly affected after the addition of S.T.R. particles
in PLDLA-TMC. Therefore, it is interesting from
the point of view of application since to be used as a wound dressing,
it needs to be highly flexible when the clinical purpose is concerned
with the use on the skin. The PLDLA-TMC membrane did not present endothermic
peaks that could be related to the melting points (Tm). In this way, it is indicative of that PLDLA-TMC shows
an amorphous structure.23 Therefore, it
can be seen that the addition of S.T.R. particles in PLDLA-TMC did
not promote a crystalline organization.

Thermogravimetric Analysis
The results of the TGA are shown in Figure 7 and Table 3. The S.T.R. powder presented two Tonset values. The first Tonset value is 35.5 °C and is related to the loss of moisture from
the S.T.R. powder, whereas the second one is 238.9 °C and is
related to the degradation of the S.T.R. powder.

Table 3 TGA Results
sample	Tonset (°C)	
S.T.R. powder	35.5/238.9	
PLDLA-TMC	285.8	
PLDLA-TMC + 5%S.T.R.	323.6	
PLDLA-TMC + 10%S.T.R.	320.8	
PLDLA-TMC + 20%S.T.R.	326.2	
PLDLA-TMC + 50%S.T.R.	320.3	
The thermal degradation onset temperature (Tonset) for the PLDLA-TMC membrane was 285.8
°C, and the Tonset values for PLDLA-TMC
+ 5%S.T.R., PLDLA-TMC + 10%S.T.R., PLDLA-TMC + 20, and PLDLA-TMC +
50%S.T.R. membranes were approximately 323.6, 320.8, 326.2, and 320.3
°C, respectively. For all concentrations of S.T.R. added in PLDLA-TMC,
there was an increase in the Tonset when
compared to PLDLA-TMC without S.T.R. This could be related to the
decrease of thermal agitation of polymeric chains due to the presence
of S.T.R. tactoids. Thus, the Tonset value
increases. In addition, the presence of tactoids of S.T.R. may decrease
the permeation of hot gas from the furnace atmosphere into the sample
since these tactoids present in PLDLA-TMC increase the tortuosity
within the polymer membrane. Therefore, the presence of S.T.R. can
retard the degradation in the samples with STR particles.

In Vitro Biocompatibility
As already shown by Jin et al.,27 natural
extracts can induce either cell death or proliferative behavior. Thus,
the ideal concentration used is mandatory to determine how inductive
the extract could be, i.e., whether it presents bioactive properties.
Recently, it was shown that PLDLA-TMC containing Aloe vera could induce
even at higher concentrations a strong increase in cell growth.28 Since the surface topography and the substances
released can influence directly cell adhesion, no washing steps were
performed for LCSM live-imaging observations. In this way, as observed
in Figure 8, the fibroblasts
adhered to all PLDLA-TMC containing S.T.R. presented a morphology
indicative of very low adhesion as compared to pure membranes of PLDLA-TMC.
Despite this phenotype, which could be supposed to lead to cell death,
it was possible to observe in Figure 9 that the counted cells from 1 to 7 days presented
an overall cell growth followed by a late spread polygonal morphology.
Rah et al.29 showed that cells that presented
late spreading behavior were able to metabolize the bioactive substances
delivered in the medium, preventing their death due to the reactive
oxygen species.

Figure 8 LSCM live images of the fibroblast cells adhered to PLDLA-TMC
containing S.T.R. at different concentrations. Thermanox coverslips
were used as negative controls. Alive cells were identified by calcein
green AM. The scale bar is 50 μm (the inset area is 100 μm).

Figure 9 Cell growth curves of fibroblast cells adhered to PLDLA-TMC
containing S.T.R. at different concentrations. Statistical significance
bars are identified as * P < 0.01 and #P < 0.05.

The wide range of S.T.R. concentrations evaluated showed that the
concentration of 10% presented a growth peak more than 100% as compared
to PLDLA-TMC, although the cell morphology remained roundish at all
cultured times. Nevertheless, when under 50%, cell growth was stabilized;
therefore, the lower growth identified was followed by the spreading
recovery. As observed in Figure 2, the contact angle of PLDLA-TMC itself as compared
to all other S.T.R. concentrations was around 20° higher. This
could be reflected by the same low adhesion pattern observed in all
S.T.R.-containing samples (Figure 8). The contact angle cannot be solely used as a parameter
that can interfere in cell spreading; the surface topography and the
substances released by the material are the main features that can
influence cell behavior.30,31 As observed in Figure 1, the SEM showed
that the more the concentration of S.T.R. in PLDLA-TMC, the rougher
the surface was. Despite this condition, as depicted in Figure 4, the release profile showed
that PLDLA-TMC + 5, 10, and 20% S.T.R. reached a plateau at around
50 h, and this continuous release is a strong indicative that can influence
cell behavior.

Striking differences were observed in the release
pattern of PLDLA-TMC + 50% of S.T.R. (threefold higher than the other
concentrations), which corroborates that the release interferes in
cell growth, as observed in Figure 9. Interestingly, the low cell growth was not indicative
of cell death since no dead cells were identified by Ethd-1 (data
not shown) on any sample. Nevertheless, after 7 days, cell spreading
was identified at the highest S.T.R. concentration used. Thus, the
late cell spreading, despite the continuous high S.T.R. release beyond
150 h, is clear evidence that cells were able to metabolize S.T.R.,
which represents a very low cytotoxicity effect even in very high
concentrations.

S.T.R. is known for its anti-inflammatory responses,32 and based on the in vitro biocompatibility results,
the PLDLA-TMC + 50% S.T.R. was chosen for further in vivo analysis.
After 7 and 14 days of the controlled skin burn injury procedure and
curative addition, the histological analysis revealed that epidermis
was fully necrotic in negative controls but partially healed when
pure PLDLA-TMC was covering the skin (Figure 10). Although a crust in the coagulation zone
was observed in all negative and positive control curatives, after
7 healing days, practically, no crust was observed in PLDLA-TMC +
50% S.T.R. group, which was followed by an extended thin new epidermis
containing cutaneous follicles. The dermis also showed major changes
by the bioactive S.T.R. effect. The papillary dermis presented few
inflammatory infiltrates as compared to controls after 7 days, whereas
no inflammatory response was identified after 14 days. In addition,
a new delicate smooth connective tissue containing collagen fibers
bordering the neoepidermis was found in all healing areas.

Figure 10 Histological
analysis of the burned skin area after 7 and 14 day addition of PLDLA-TMC
+ 50% S.T.R. and its controls. Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed
a low-magnification overview of the healing area (left) and the region
of interest (right), which indicates the most remarkable changes in
tissue regeneration. The scale bars are 200 and 100 μm, respectively.

As reported by Lau et al.,33 adipose tissues derived from hypodermis and the pulp and root sheath
of cutaneous follicles are the initial structures that trigger skin
regeneration. It can be observed here that the adipose tissue is broadly
identified in controls, whereas in curatives containing S.T.R., the
skin lacks adipose cells and instead reveals a new epidermis migration
originally from the follicle epithelial cells. Usually, the granulation
tissue provides a provisional wound bed for re-epithelialization,33 but since S.T.R. strongly decreased the inflammatory
response and prevented necrosis spreading to deep layers in the skin,
apparently, S.T.R. also preserved the follicle pulp, which can explain
the rapid follicle recovery and epidermis neoformation after 7 days.
It is well known that the necrotic tissue spreads out from outer to
inner areas due to the burn injuries until modulatory stem cell regulation
and angiogenesis take place in the wound.34 Hypoperfusion after the injury is the main cause that can downregulate
tissue homeostasis leading to necrosis, but when PLDLA-TMC was deposited
covering the burn wound, the fluid loss was prevented while S.T.R.
upregulated the inflammatory response. This can be corroborated by
the immunohistochemistry results indicated in Figure 11. The specific molecular markers for inflammatory
responses (MPO and CD68) showed strong labeling for MPO and CD68 in
the crust, which is something expected to occur in coagulation, but
in dermis when S.T.R. was present, no inflammatory markers were identified
as compared to controls. Despite that PCNA identification was evident
in all samples, mainly in the basal layer of the new epidermis, in
pure PLDLA-TMC samples, this labeling was spread in the new dermis
after 7 days, whereas cell clusters positive for PCNA were strongly
identified in the membranes containing S.T.R. at the same time. After
14 days, the negative and positive controls presented inflammatory
infiltration in deeper layers of the dermis, even within the muscular
endomysium.

Figure 11 Immunohistochemistry of molecular markers CD68, MPO, and
PCNA after 7 and 14 days of the burn injury. PLDLA-TMC + 50% S.T.R.
and its controls revealed distribution in the epidermis and dermis
of leukocytes, granulocytes, macrophages, and cells under proliferation.
The scale bar is 100 μm.

Interestingly, in PLDLA-TMC + 50% S.T.R., no inflammatory response
was identified, whereas PCNA immunoreactive cells were fully identified
in the dermis despite low labeling in the basal epidermis layer. This result revealed that after 14 days, the newly formed epidermis
was fully developed whereas the dermis was highly undergoing fibroblast
proliferation and matrix synthesis. As reported by Kulac et al.,35 the burned rat skin showed strong PCNA labeling
in extended re-epithelialization after only 4 days post injury in
wounds treated with curcumin. In the same burn model, Ju et al.36 demonstrated that the dermis was faster regenerated
when treated with the nanomatrix of silk fibroin, which reflected
high collagen expression.

Taken together, the results of this
study indicated that the PLDLA-TMC + 50% S.T.R., as compared with
the controls, was bioactive and effective for modulating the healing
of burn wounds in rats. The accelerated wound healing can be attributed
to the inflammatory upregulating effects of S.T.R. resulting in the
full development of the epidermis and high proliferation of dermal
fibroblasts.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the PLDLA-TMC
+ 50% S.T.R. had a desired elongation at break to be applied as a
bandage since it could be molded in skin curves. Also, the release
pattern was higher than that of other S.T.R. concentrations. In vitro
biocompatibility revealed that despite low growth, the cells cultured
were able to spread even at the highest S.T.R. concentrations. Due
to all of these results, the PLDLA-TMC + 50% S.T.R. was chosen for
the in vivo tests. This study suggests that PLDLA-TMC + 50% is efficient
to be utilized in therapeutics for treating the injured skin by suppressing
inflammation, stimulating re-epithelialization and dermal recovery,
and subsequently reducing the wound-healing period. Therefore, the
mechanical and thermal properties associated with the biologically
inductive features make the PLDLA-TMC + 50% S.T.R. a promising candidate
as a bandage to promote skin regeneration.
