Organic light-emitting transistors (OLETs) integrate
the light-emitting
and gate-modulated electrical switching functions in a single device.
Over the past decades, progress has been made in developing new fluorescent
semiconductors and device engineering that pushed efficiencies of
OLET devices to 8%. However, this efficiency of transistors is still
too low to be competitive with organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs).
Currently, there are relatively few suitable organic fluorescent semiconductors
suitable for OLETs, and the mechanism of electroluminescence in the
devices is still not fully understood. In this mini-review, we discuss
the state of highly efficient OLETs and plausible approaches to those
unsettled problems. Since this is a mini-review, we will not be able
to cover all the excellent work in the literature. Readers are encouraged
to read other excellent reviews published earlier.

1 Introduction
Organic optoelectronics
have experienced tremendous growth in recent
decades. New organic semiconducting materials exhibiting unique electrical,
optical, and magnetic properties were developed and used to create
devices with a variety of functionality. Among them, organic light-emitting
diodes (OLEDs) represent one of the most significant advancements
in the field that has been successfully commercialized. At the same
time, another type of organic electronic component, field-effect transistors
(OFETs), is still in the experimental stage. Numerous innovations
based on OFETs appeared, which stimulated further development in both
material design, our understanding of π-electronic systems,
and device engineering.1 The organic light-emitting
transistor (OLET) is a unique type of electronic device that combines
the advantages of electrical switching from field-effect transistors
(FET) and light-emitting property from LEDs. These devices exhibit
the potential to simplify the fabrication of existing display systems
and may significantly boost progress in new areas, such as photonic
communications and electrically pumped organic lasers.2−5 In an OLED device, electrons and holes are injected into a thin
layer of emissive material with a thickness around 100 nm, sandwiched
between the two electrodes. At the same time, the electrons and holes
in OLET devices are injected through the source-drain electrodes and
recombine in the transport channel that is 10–100 μm
long. This difference made the development of OLETs more challenge
than that of OLEDs.

Ideal light-emitting semiconductors for
OLETs need to have appropriate
energy levels to minimize charge injection barriers from metal contacts,
and they require high, balanced, and, ideally, ambipolar charge carrier
mobility to ensure light emission at the center of the channel. They
also need to have high fluorescence quantum yield. Therefore, the
suitable separation of charge transport and luminescent sites as shown
in copolymer polyfluorene6 is important
in designing OLET materials. To achieve efficient exciton to photon
conversion and lower operating voltages, a dielectric layer with high k(7) must be used. Design strategies
developed in OLED devices such as microcavities, nanoscale structures,
patterning of photonic crystals, etc., should be implemented in OLETs.
All these parameters must be carefully fine-tuned to balance optoelectronic
processes in the device and achieve the most efficient exciton-to-photon
conversion. However, one of the challenges of OLET optimization is
the fact that these requirements are often mutually exclusive. For
example, materials demonstrating high charge carrier mobility usually
exhibit efficient π–π stacking and good electronic
coupling to ensure efficient intermolecular charge transport. At the
same time, efficient π–π stacking causes fluorescence
quenching due to the formation of exciplexes/excimers, charge transfer
states, and other nonradiative decay processes.

High-performance
FET semiconductors generally have high charge
mobility but low photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). For example,
rubrene has high mobility of 15 cm2 V–1 s–1 due to its tight intermolecular π–π
stacking; however, its PLQY is very low, <1%.8 In contrast, OLED materials show high quantum yield in
the solid state, while the SCLC charge mobility is relatively low
(<10–3 cm2 V–1 s–1).9 Thus, mobility fluorescence
trade-off is one of the major barriers limiting material design for
highly efficient OLETs.10,11 Several approaches
to overcoming this trade-off have been reported in the literature,
such as insertion of single-crystal active layers in single-layer
devices and multilayer device architectures, where charge transport
and light-emitting functions are separated in different layers. In
this mini-review we discuss these approaches in more detail.

2 Design of OLETs
Single-layer OLETs
In 2003, Hepp and co-workers used
the bottom gate bottom contact (BG–BC) structure to fabricate
single-layer FET devices with an organic small-molecule semiconductor,
tetracene (Figure 1A and 1B). The FET devices showed unipolar p-type behavior with the hole mobility of 5 × 10–2 cm2 V–1 s–1. For the first time, they observed light emission originating near
the drain electrode in a working transistor device. The wavelength
of the emission spectral maximum was at 540 nm which is consistent
with tetracene’s photoluminescence spectrum.12 The intensity of emitted light and the photocurrent increased
with the increasing source-drain and gate voltages but appeared saturated
at more negative voltages over −60 V. Based on the energy levels
of tetracene, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) (−5.4
eV) is favorable for hole injection. The energy barrier of 2.7 eV
between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) (− 2.4
eV) of tetracene and the work function of gold electrodes (WF = 5.1
eV) hinders electron injection. The authors attributed the electron
injection to electrical field-assisted electron tunneling from the
drain electrode (Figure 1C). The holes injected from the source electrode and transported
through the channel recombined radiatively with the tunneled electrons
near the drain electrode, and light emission was observed. Due to
the proximity of light emission to the metal drain electrode, significant
quenching was observed. As a result of this quenching and the low
PLQY of tetracene film, the obtained EQE of OLET devices was only
6.7 × 10–5%.

Much better results were achieved for OLET devices
with tetracene
single crystals.13 Takahashi and co-workers
used bottom gate–top contact configuration with PMMA dielectric
and silver paste source-drain electrodes to make FET devices with
single-crystal tetracene. When device fabrication and characterization
were conducted in an inert atmosphere, without air exposure, they
observed ambipolar behavior with the hole and electron mobilities
of 9.7 × 10–2 and 1.3 × 10–2 cm2 V–1 s–1, respectively.
Even though hole mobility improved almost 2-fold, compared to amorphous
tetracene films, there was still a significant energy barrier present
for electron injection in the device. To address this issue, the authors
used an asymmetric gold–magnesium source-drain electrode. The
lower work function of magnesium (3.66 eV) decreased the energy barrier
to 1.3 eV and facilitated electron injection. As a result, electron
mobility increased almost three times, to 3.7 × 10–2 cm2 V–1 s–1. Light
emission was observed in devices with both symmetrical and asymmetrical
source-drain electrodes. Due to the ambipolar behavior of the device,
the position of the light-emitting zone was dependent on source-drain
voltage VSD and moved from the Mg drain
to the Au source when the value of VSD decreased from −179 to −255 V. However, no EQE was
reported for these devices.

Despite the promising results obtained
for the OLET with single-crystal
tetracene, the device performance was far from ideal. Unbalanced hole/electron
mobility, crystal defects, and low PLQY of tetracene resulted in weak
and nonuniform light emission. Many alternative materials have been
studied for OLET applications. For example, small-molecule single
crystals based on α,ω-bis(biphenylyl)terthiophene (BP3T),
1,4-bis(4-methylstyryl)benzene (CH3-P3 V2), and 2-(4-hexylphenylvinyl)anthracene
(HPVAnt) showed both high charge mobility and high solid-state PLQY
over 70% which is ideal for OLETs.3 More
recently, Hu and co-workers studied small-molecule materials DPA and
dNaAnt as emissive layers for OLETs. DPA and dNaAnt have high-lying
LUMOs at around −2.6 eV and high solid-state PLQY of 41.2%
and 29.2%, respectively. These molecules with substituted 2,6-positions
of anthracene with benzene (DPA) or naphthalene (dNaAnt) moieties
(Figure 2A) preserve
good photoluminescence properties of anthracene. At the same time,
superior charge transport properties are maintained due to extension
of π-conjugation length and the formation of J-aggregates in
the solid state.14−16 Both of these materials were used as emissive layers
in BG-TC OLET devices with asymmetric source-drain electrodes Ca/CsF
(with a low WF of 2.5 eV) and Au/MoO3 (with a high WF of
5.3 eV) (Figure 2B).
Both devices exhibited good electronic properties. Devices with DPA
achieved hole and electron mobility of 1.99 and 0.33 cm2 V–1 s–1. In comparison, more
balanced hole and electron mobilities of 0.73 and 1.11 cm2 V–1 s–1 are obtained in dNaAnt,
which has more extended conjugated structure (Figure 2C). The OLET devices based on DPA and dNant
showed EQE of 1.61 and 1.75%, respectively, which are the highest
among single-crystal devices (Figure 2D).

Recently, molecular charge-transfer (CT) cocrystals
have attracted
research interest in ambipolar charge transport and luminescence.17 The molecular orbital interactions in the donor
and acceptor allow superexchange electronic coupling, thus enabling
both hole and electron transport in a single CT crystal. At the same
time, high solid-state PLQY is retained, which makes these materials
very promising for OLET applications. As demonstrated by Park et al.
in 2017,18 the 2D-type slab CT crystal
composed of 2MDCS (DCT3) and CN-TFPA (ACT3)
with the ratio of 2:1 (Figure 3A) shows potential as emissive material for OLETs. This cocrystal
exhibits high PLQY of 60% in the solid state. The high-lying HOMO
(−5.7 eV) in DCT3 and low-lying LUMO (−3.3
eV) in ACT3 facilitate the injection of both holes and
electrons, thus achieving balanced electron and hole mobility of around
10–4 cm2 V–1 s–1 (Figure 3B). Green emission is observed in a working OLET device with
the EQE as high as 0.14 and 1.5% in p-channel and n-channel modes,
respectively (Figure 3C).

In addition to small-molecule semiconductors, single-layer
OLET
devices have also been successfully realized based on polymer semiconductors.
In 2006, Henning Sirringhaus and co-workers used poly(9,9-di-n-octylfluorene-alt-benzothiadiazole) (F8BT)
as an active emissive layer and fabricated top gate–bottom
contact (TGBC) OLET devices.19 A transparent
glass was used as a substrate, and source, drain, and gate electrodes
were all made of gold. A thick layer of PMMA (400–800 nm) was
used as a dielectric and an encapsulating layer. A high-lying HOMO
of −5.9 eV and low-lying LUMO of −3.3 eV are found in
F8BT, which is favorable for hole and electron injection (Figure 4A). Balanced hole
and electron mobilities of 7.5 × 10–4 and 8.4
× 10–4 cm2 V–1 s–1, respectively, were achieved, as calculated
from the transfer curves shown in Figure 4C. In addition, high PLQY of 50–60%
is achieved in the solid films, making F8BT a good candidate for OLETs.
As shown in the OLET device structure, green emission is found near
the electrodes at low gate voltage. The position of the emission zone
and light intensity were dependent on the gate voltage. Bright emission
from the center of the channel was observed for higher gate voltages.
Notably, the highest EQE of 0.75% was achieved in p-transport mode (VDS = −100 V; VG ≈ −40 V). The authors optimized
this device structure even further and used silver (Ag) to replace
gold as the top gate electrode and inserted zinc oxide (ZnO) as the
electron injection layer to form asymmetric electrodes. Much higher
EQE of over 8% was achieved in these devices which is a record-performing
OLET device to this day.20 Interestingly,
the observed OLET performance is even higher than the corresponding
OLED.

2.2 Multilayer OLETs
Due to mobility–photoluminescence
trade-off, it is challenging to design highly emissive materials that
also exhibit good electrical semiconducting properties. Multilayer
OLET devices were introduced as one of the solutions to this problem.
Balanced ambipolar charge transport can be achieved by preparing the
p–n junction using both p- and n-type fluorescent semiconductors
in a single device. The electroluminescent property can then be fine-tuned.
For example, by tuning of the coevaporation ratio of p-type semiconductor,
a-quinquethiophene (a-5T) and n-type semiconductor
N, and N′-ditridecylperylene 3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic
diimide (P13) in the bulk heterojunction films, Loi and co-workers
achieved a large range of control in both charge mobility and electroluminescent
intensity.21 The drawback of this approach
is that though charge recombination probability is increased in the
bulk heterojunction structure, the flow of charge carrier is impeded,
which limits the EL efficiency. In 2010, Sirringhaus and co-workers
proposed a lateral heterostructure, in which the tunable recombination
zone and high ambipolar charge mobility were achieved.22 F8BT and poly(9,9-di-n-octylfluorene-alt-(1,4-phenylene-((4-s-butyl-phenyl)imino)-1,4-phenylene))
(TFB) were deposited through the photolithographic patterning method.
Notably, minimal material degradation and high EQE of 1.2% were achieved
in these OLET devices.

Multilayer devices have charge injecting,
charge transporting, and emissive functions separated in different
layers which allows a separate optimization of each component (Figure 5). As shown in Figure 5A, Bazan and co-workers
selected a series of fluorescent polymers such as super yellow (SY),
poly[2-methoxy5-(2′-ethyhexyloxy-1,4-phenylenevinylene)] (MEH-PPV),
and poly[9,9-di(ethylhexyl)fluorene] (PFO) as the emissive layers
and designed multilayer OLET devices.23 In order to facilitate electron injection, a conjugated polyelectrolyte,
poly[9′,9-bis[6′(N,N,N-trimethylammonium)hexyl] florene-alt-co-1,4-phenylene], with tetrakis (imidazoyl) borate counterion (PFN+BIm4–) was inserted between the
source-drain electrodes and the emissive layer. The migration of ions
and the dipole effectively modified the interfacial energy and decreased
the energy barrier for electron injection. Besides, to ensure good
charge transport in OLET devices, a hole-transporting layer poly(2,5-bis(3alkylthiophene-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene) (PBTTT) was inserted between the emissive layer
and gate dielectric as shown in Figure 5A. As a result of this device engineering, the hole
can be directly injected into the HOMO of PBTTT and transported to
the vicinity of the drain electrode, where electron is injected to
the LUMO of the emissive layer through the electron-injecting layer,
PFN+BIm4–. Electrons and holes
recombine radiatively near the drain electrode, and light emission
is observed. All three fluorescent polymers with the different energy
levels showed bright electroluminescence and similar EQE of 10–3%. It should be noted that symmetric source-drain
electrodes were used in these devices, and all three layers were solution
processed. The relatively low EQE is attributed to the proximity of
the recombination zone to the metal electrodes due to unipolar charge
transport behavior.

Trilayer OLET structures were also successfully
realized in thermally
evaporated devices, as shown in Figure 5B.24 5,5′″-Dihexyl-2,2′:5′,2″:5″,2″′-quaterthiophene
(DH-4T) and fluorine-substituted DFH-4T were used as a hole-transporting
layer and electron-transporting layer, respectively. The transporting
layers exhibited good match of energy levels with the emissive layer
material and balanced charge mobility (μh = 0.01
cm2 V–1 s–1, μe = 0.01 cm2 V–1 s–1). The emissive layer was composed of the host tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminum
(Alq3) and guest 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-methyl-6-(p-dimethylaminostyryl)-4H-pyran (DCM).
As a result of balanced charge mobility in the device, the observed
emission zone was pushed away from the metal electrodes to the middle
of the channel, which decreased exciton quenching and resulted in
EQE as high as 5% at gate voltage of 30 V. The efficiency obtained
in this OLET is nearly 100 times higher than the corresponding OLED,
demonstrating the great competitive potential of the OLET.

Besides,
different light emission mechanisms were utilized in developing
OLETs. For example, Liu et al. utilized the thermally activated delayed
fluorescence (TADF) emitters to prepare heterostructure OLETs to harvest
the triplet excitons.25 They developed
an exciplex TADF emitter based on m-MTDATA (4,4′,4″-tris(N-3-methylphenyl-N-phenylamino)triphenylamine)
as the donor and OXD-7 (1,3-bis[2-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazo-5-yl]benzene)
as the acceptor, and an exciton utilization efficiency of 74.3% for
the devices was achieved. Notably, a maximum EQE of 3.76% was achieved
in this multilayer OLET device.

3 Conclusion and Outlook
In the past
two decades, modest progress has been made in designing
high mobility fluorescent semiconductors and optimizing device structures
for OLETs. However, there are still several critical issues that need
to be addressed: (1) the relative scarcity of high-performance organic
materials, (2) low EQE in comparison with OLEDs (>20%), and (3)
unclear
electroluminescence mechanism in the OLET, especially in the case
of multilayer ambipolar devices. In the future work, the introduction
of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials and radical
emitters26 in OLET will make a full use
of spin dynamics and may overcome the limitations of traditional organic
luminescent materials. Moreover, hybrid devices utilizing high mobility
inorganic semiconductors, such as carbon nanotube (CNT), graphene,
or perovskite, as the transporting layer may become a viable alternative
and improve the performance of OLET devices.27 Meanwhile, development of more efficient dielectrics with high dielectric
constant may lower the electrical and optical threshold voltages and
realize efficient low-power devices.7,28 Notably, the
integration of additional functions in OLETs may also be an interesting
new direction. Recently demonstrated optically switchable OLETs show
great promise in device patterning.29
