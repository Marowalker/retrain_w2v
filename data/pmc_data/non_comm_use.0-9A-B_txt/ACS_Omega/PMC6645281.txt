Recently,
the decarboxylation of oleic acid (9(Z)-octadecenoic
acid) catalyzed by triruthenium dodecacarbonyl, Ru3(CO)12, to give a mixture of heptadecenes with
concomitant formation of other hydrocarbons, heptadecane and C17 alkylbenzenes,
was reported. The product mixture, consisting of about 77% heptadecene
isomers, 18% heptadecane, and slightly >4% C17 alkylbenzenes, possesses
acceptable diesel fuel properties. This reaction is now applied to
other fatty acids of varying chain length and degree of saturation
as well as double-bond configuration and position. Acids beyond oleic
acid included in the present study are lauric (dodecanoic), myristic
(tetradecanoic), palmitic (hexadecanoic), stearic (octadecanoic),
petroselinic (6(Z)-octadecenoic), elaidic (9(E)-octadecenoic), asclepic (11(Z)-octadecenoic),
and linoleic (9(Z),12(Z)-octadecadienoic)
acids. Regardless of the chain length and degree of unsaturation,
a similar product mixture was obtained in all cases with a mixture
of alkenes predominating. Monounsaturated fatty acids, however, afforded
the alkane with one carbon less than the parent fatty acid as the
most prominent component in the mixture. Alkylbenzenes with one carbon
atom less than the parent fatty acid were also present in all product
mixtures. The number of isomeric alkenes and alkylbenzenes depends
on the number of carbons in the chain of the parent fatty acid. With
linoleic acid as the starting material, the amount of alkane was reduced
significantly with alkenes and alkylaromatics enhanced compared to
the monounsaturated fatty acids. Two alkenes, 9(E)-tetradecene and 1-hexadecene, were also studied as starting materials.
A similar product mixture was observed but with comparatively minor
amount of alkane formed and alkene isomers dominating at almost 90%.
The double-bond position and configuration in the starting material
do not influence the pattern of alkene isomers in the product mixture.
The results underscore the multifunctionality of the Ru3(CO)12 catalyst, which promotes a reaction sequence including
decarboxylation, isomerization, desaturation, hydrogenation, and cyclization
(aromatization) to give a mixture of hydrocarbons simulating petrodiesel
fuels. A reaction pathway is proposed to explain the existence of
these products, in which alkenes are dehydrogenated to alkadienes
and then, under cyclization, to the observed alkylaromatics. The liberated
hydrogen can then saturate alkenes to the corresponding alkane.

==== Body
Introduction
The production of fuels from renewable
resources continues to be
a major focus on reducing the dependence on petroleum, lessening carbonization
of energy sources, and reducing exhaust emissions. Among these, fuels
are those derived from vegetable oils or, more generally, plant oils.
Several types of fuels can be produced from plant oils. One is biodiesel1,2 which is the (mono)alkyl esters of vegetable oils, animal fats,
or other triacylglycerol-based oils or fats and obtained by a transesterification
reaction. Another is a fuel best termed renewable diesel which consists
of a mixture of hydrocarbons obtained by a hydrodeoxygenation reaction3−12 which usually involves decarboxylation and hydrogenation of oleochemical
materials by adding H2 in the presence of sulfided NiMo–Al2O3, CoMo–Al2O3, Ni/SiO2, Pd/C, Raney nickel, or similar catalysts.13−21 Renewable diesel, which is also known by other terms, such as hydrotreated
vegetable oils, consists of straight-chain and branched alkanes. Straight-chain
alkanes are the straightforward products of this reaction, for example,
heptadecane is the “ideal” hydrocarbon obtained from
C18 fatty acids but lesser amounts of side products such as alkenes
and aromatics may also arise. Jet fuels22,23 can be obtained
via a subsequent isomerization reaction of the product mixture to
give branched alkanes with improved cold flow properties.

Besides
the energy-related materials mentioned above, 1-alkenes
(also known as α-olefins) are of considerable interest as starting
materials for a variety of commercially valuable derivatives. These
compounds have been synthesized from long-chain fatty acids and their
related compounds via dehydrating decarbonylation/decarboxylation
by catalytic approaches24,25 using mainly Pd-, Pt-,
Rh-, Ir-, or Ru-based organometallic catalysts and, in a more recent
development, enzymatic catalysts. The formation of mixtures of alkenes
in such reactions has also been reported. Similar to long, straight-chain
alkanes that are ideal constituents of petrodiesel, the mixtures of
alkenes (and side products) may also be of interest as fuels as their
high cetane numbers show that, although resulting from the presence
of double bonds, their oxidative stability is reduced compared to
the saturated alkanes. Examples in the literature describing decarboxylation/decarbonylation
with dehydration reactions include using lead tetraacetate in the
presence of Cu(II) to give α-olefins,26 stearic acid to a mixture of heptadecenes using rhodium trichloride
and triphenylphosphine,27 Ni- and Pd-based
catalysts for decarboxylating heptanoic and octanoic acids,28 conversion of carboxylic acids to mixed anhydrides
which add to a PdCl2-DPE-Phos catalyst,29 various iridium-based catalysts,30 linear olefins by decarboxylation of unsaturated fatty acids with
Ag(II)/NaS2O8,31 FeCl2/KI, or FeI2/KI,32 and
linear olefins and α,ω-dienes from saturated fatty acids
with PdCl2/Ph3P or Pd(PP3)4/Ph3P,33 PdCl2(PPh3)2,34,35 and Pd/Al2O3.36 A different example is the formation
of alkanes or saturated fatty acids from saturated and unsaturated
fatty acids with Pt/C or PtSnx/C in water.37,38

In connection with the synthesis of alkenes from fatty acids,
we
recently reported that oleic acid, which is probably the most common
fatty acid in plant oils, can be decarboxylated in the presence of
triruthenium dodecacarbonyl (Ru3(CO)12) to a
mixture of isomeric heptadecenes and heptadecanes, accompanied by
a lesser amount of isomeric C17 alkylaromatics.39−41 The heptadecene
isomers comprises about 77% of the mixture, whereas heptadecane is
the single most prominent component at about 18% with alkylaromatics
at approximately 4%. To the best of our knowledge, this is probably
the first time that decarboxylation was reported with Ru3(CO)12 as a catalyst, although Ru3(CO)12 has found its use in numerous other reactions, including
isomerizations, alkylations, and arylations.42 Here, we report an expansion of that work and the compositional
analysis of the products to other fatty acids of different chain lengths
(C12–C18) and saturation including saturated and diunsaturated
fatty acids while keeping other reaction parameters constant. To the
best of our knowledge, there are also only few reports37,38 on the decarboxylation of a neat polyunsaturated fatty acid such
as linoleic acid. Two alkenes were also selected as starting materials
to investigate if aromatization and hydrogenation also occur with
hydrocarbons, providing insight into the reaction pathways.

Results
and Discussion
Analyses by gas chromatography-flame ionization
detection and gas
chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) of the product
mixtures and their dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) derivatives for the determination
of double positions showed that several classes of compounds are formed
in the reaction of fatty acids and alkenes with catalytic Ru3(CO)12. All products from the reaction of fatty acids
with Ru3(CO)12, regardless of saturation or
double-bond position and configuration, possess one carbon atom less
than the starting material, showing that nearly quantitative decarboxylation
occurs. In the case of alkenes as starting materials, of course, the
number of carbons remains the same as that of the starting material.
Summarily, the classes of compounds formed are an alkane, all possible
isomers of the corresponding alkenes, a mixture of alkadienes, and
a mixture of alkylaromatics. Although the overall pattern of the classes
of compounds formed remains the same, the ratios, however, in which
they are formed strongly depend on the starting material. The number
of possible isomers of alkenes and alkylaromatics decreases systematically
with decreasing chain length of the fatty acid used as the starting
material. Table 1 contains
information on the nature of the compounds formed, and these compounds
are discussed below, whereas Table 2 presents the yields of the different classes of compounds.
As an example, Figure 1 depicts a GC–MS total ion chromatogram of the products of
the reaction of palmitic acid with Ru3(CO)12. Figure 2 contains
information on the evaluation of the mass spectra corresponding to
the peaks in the GC–MS run shown in Figure 1. A pathway to the products is proposed in Figure 3.

Figure 2 Mass spectra of the products of the reaction of palmitic acid with
Ru3(CO)12 after derivatization with DMDS. The
subscripts p and q correspond to those in this figure. The peaks labeled
1–19 are assigned as follows: (1) pentadecane, (2–6)
aromatics with peak 5 assigned to nonylbenzene (for further details
see text), and (7–19) DMDS derivatives of pentadecene isomers.
As examples only the mass spectra corresponding to peaks 17–19
are shown which are (17,18) the erythro and threo diastereomers of
2,3-bis(methylthio)pentadecane and (19) 1,2-bis(methylthio)pentadecane,
respectively. Similar to peaks 17 and 18, peaks 7–16 are caused
by the erthyro and threo diastereomers of the other bis(methylthio)pentadecanes
derived from (E)- and (Z)-pentadecenes,
respectively.

Alkane Products
The reaction of alkenes with Ru3(CO)12 leads to the corresponding saturated alkane
of the same chain length. The alkane derived from fatty acids with n carbon atoms (in Figure 3: n = x + 2) is Cn–1H2(n–1)+2 (=Cn–1H2n).

Alkene Products
The number of all positional and geometric
(E and Z) alkene isomers that can
be formed from fatty acids with an even number of n carbon atoms in the chain is n – 3. For
fatty acids with odd n, the number of possible alkene
isomers is n – 2. In the case of alkenes as
starting materials, the number of isomers is n –
1 if n is even and the number of alkene isomers is n – 2 for odd n. The presence of
all possible alkene isomers was ascertained by the derivatization
of the product mixture with DMDS40 which
afforded the corresponding bis(methylthio) alkanes. In all cases,
both diastereomers of each bis(methylthio) alkane positional isomer
were identified by GC–MS.40 The
number of possible alkenes (accounting for Z and E double-bond configurations) in the product mixture is
given in Table 1. The
products with Z configuration dominate over those
with E configuration. Additionally, a thermodynamic
(or near) distribution of alkene products was obtained, as indicated
by lesser amounts (around 1–2%) of individual terminally unsaturated
(and thus less thermodynamically favored) alkenes relative to higher
amounts of individual internal (i.e., more stable) alkenes.

Alkyl
aromatic Products
The alkylaromatics formed are
of the type H(CH2)s–C6H4–(CH)tH with s + t = n – 7.
Accordingly, the number of isomeric alkylaromatics that can be formed
from fatty acids with even n is (n – 6)/2, giving, for example, six alkyl aromatic compounds
from fatty acids with n = 18, and for fatty acids
with odd n, it is (n – 5)/2.
In the case of alkenes with even n, (n – 4)/2 alkylaromatics of this type can arise and with odd n, it is (n – 5)/2. Table 1 lists the possible isomers
(with the combination of s + t)
of the alkyl aromatic compounds that are observed in the product mixtures.
One compound in each mixture is unambiguously identified as the monoalkylbenzene
with s = n – 7 (x – 5 in Figure 3). This evaluation resembles that given in the literature for alkylbenzenes
found in some crude oil.43 It may be noted
that the formation of minor amount of aromatics was also observed,15,17 but the presence of hydrogen in these reactions may reduce the amount
of aromatics.15

The nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectra also confirm the existence of compounds with
aromatic moieties. An integration ratio of about 8.7:1 of alkene to
aromatic protons (unresolved peak at 7.1–7.2 ppm) was observed.
Assuming that four protons (−C6H4−)
are responsible for the aromatic signals (regardless of the number
of isomers) with two protons (−CH=CH−) causing
the olefinic signals, a ratio of alkenes to aromatics of about 17:1
is obtained. This result agrees well with the evaluation by GC. The
NMR spectra also agree well with previous data.40

Alkadiene Products
This class of
compounds is the least
prominent in the product mixture, consistently constituting 1.5% or
less. The number of possible isomers exceeds the number of discrete
peaks observed which may be due to overlap and the very minor amounts
of individual alkadiene isomers that are formed. No assignments to
individual compounds were made. It appears likely, however, that the
alkadienes are precursors to the alkylaromatics as further dehydrogenation
would lead to alkatrienes which may spontaneously cyclize to the stable
alkylaromatics under the influence of the Ru3(CO)12 catalyst (shown in Figure 3). A detailed mechanistic investigation of this proposed pathway
would need to be the subject of a further study.

Product Mixture from Alkenes
(7(E)-Tetradecene
and 1-Hexadecene) as a Starting Material
As mentioned above,
when using alkenes as starting materials, the product mixture consists
of compounds with the same number of carbons. Although alkenes predominate
in the mixture, the overall composition is more complex than previously
reported.39 The corresponding saturated
hydrocarbon, tetradecane or hexadecane, is the single most prominent
compound because the mixture of alkenes is composed of all possible
isomers. The amount of alkane formed is minor, however, compared to
that observed with the fatty acids as starting materials (Table 2). Alkenes with double
bonds located toward the middle of the chain predominate regardless
of the position of the double bond in the two starting materials (7(E)-tetradecene and 1-hexadecene) used, although the amounts
of individual isomers were not determined. The amount of alkylaromatics
formed is low, less than 1%, whereas alkadienes were formed in slightly
greater amounts of 1–1.5%. Overall, the amount of alkylaromatics
was the lowest with alkenes as the starting materials.

Product Mixture
from Fatty Acids as Starting Materials
The GC–MS analyses
(see Figure 1 for a
typical chromatogram with the products formed
from palmitic acid as example) revealed that the same classes of compounds,
an alkane, all possible alkene isomers, alkadienes, and alkylaromatics,
observed previously in work on decarboxylation of oleic acid in the
presence of Ru3(CO)1240 are formed in all reactions. The pattern of the reaction products
appears to depend on neither the chain length, similar to the results
regarding hydrothermal deoxygenation with Pt/C,37 nor the number of double bonds and their position and configuration.
The saturated acids, monounsaturated C18:1 acids [oleic acid (9(Z)-octadecenoic acid), elaidic acid (9(E)-octadecenoic acid), asclepic acid (11(Z)-octadecenoic
acid), petroselinic acid (6(Z)-octadecenoic acid)],
and the diunsaturated linoleic acid give the same product pattern.
The alkane with one less carbon atom in the chain (Cn–1H2n) dominates in the
case of saturated fatty acids with the formation of the alkane decreasing
with increasing unsaturation of the starting material. Thus, a mixture
of all possible alkene isomers with one less carbon atom in the chain
as the parent fatty acid constitutes the bulk of the product mixture
in the case of monounsaturated fatty acids as well as linoleic acid
as the starting material. Taken individually, each alkene isomer is
present in lesser amounts than the alkane with monounsaturated fatty
acid substrates. In the case of linoleic acid as the starting material,
however, the alkane is a minor product. For a given degree of unsaturation
of C18:1 fatty acids, the relative amounts of the products vary only
in a minor to moderate fashion. Thus, position and configuration of
the double bonds have only minor influence on the product pattern.
The amount of alkylaromatics formed in cases of the saturated and
monounsaturated fatty acids (range of about 4–7%) well exceeds
that produced with alkenes as the starting material. In the case of
linoleic acid as the starting material, however, the amount of alkylaromatics
exceeds that of the other fatty acids as the starting material likely
because of the already present higher degree of unsaturation and therefore
less need for dehydrogenation. Furthermore, in the case of linoleic
acid as the starting material, the peak caused by what is likely ethylnonylbenzene
(last eluting peak in the series of aromatics) was by far the strongest
of all alkylaromatics, accounting for about 5.75% of the total of
13.5% alkylaromatics observed. Other authors37 found “heavy” products in their Pt/C in water-based
decarboxylation together with some unidentified aromatics.

Reaction Pathway
The above discussion shows that the
reaction of fatty acids with Ru3(CO)12 proceeds
with several processes occurring sequentially and/or simultaneously.
These processes include decarboxylation (shortening of the chain length),
isomerization (all positional and geometric isomers formed from unsaturated
fatty acids and alkenes), dehydrogenation (formation of alkadienes
and alkylaromatics), cyclization (aromatization; formation of alkylaromatics),
and hydrogenation (formation of alkanes). The ratios of the products
differ depending on the starting material as some of the possible
reactions are already “built-in” into the structure
of the starting materials. It appears that decarboxylation is an independent
reaction as isomerization can also occur with alkenes and methyl esters.
Furthermore, it could be assumed that the reaction consists of decarbonylation
and dehydration instead of decarboxylation and dehydrogenation, but
this is probably not the dominant path, considering that the same
classes of compounds are formed from fatty acids and alkenes (which
can be viewed as fatty acids already decarboxylated), as well as that
hydrogenation is observed in the formation of alkanes from unsaturated
starting materials. While some other reactions in which alkanes with n – 1 carbons are formed from monounsaturated fatty
acids such as oleic acid employ external hydrogen,3−21 that is not the case here. Thus, the hydrogen needed for forming
the alkane must arise in situ from other reactions, which, as the
product mixture indicates, are dehydrogenation to alkenes (in the
case of saturated fatty acids) and alkadienes as well as further dehydrogenation
with concomitant aromatization. The formation of various alkylaromatics
implies that cyclization can occur at any location in the heptadecene
chain, although the predominance of ethylnonylbenzene with linoleic
acid as a starting material may indicate some preference toward specific
products and thus double-bond locations. The fact that no alkatrienes
were identified in any of the product mixtures regardless of the starting material indicates that
aromatization likely occurs spontaneously upon dehydrogenation of
the alkadienes, likely because of the stability of the aromatic ring.
In the case of saturated fatty acids, this may be a cyclic process.
The alkane dehydrogenates to alkene and further to alkadiene and then
forms alkyl aromatic, with the hydrogen liberated in this sequence
then in turn hydrogenating some of the alkene to the alkane. It would
be of interest to investigate in detail the mechanism of this obviously
complex reaction sequence as the subject of a subsequent study. The
deoxygenation of stearic anhydride under H2-free conditions
at 250 °C using Pd/Al2O3 has been proposed
to proceed via stearic anhydride as an intermediate giving a multitude
of C17 hydrocarbons.36 Another question
that arises is if the reaction could eventually be tailored, which
may include other cocatalyst(s) or coreagent(s), to favor a specific
compound or class of compounds as product(s). This aspect could render
the reaction of considerable interest if the products may not be easily
accessible in high yields or purity otherwise and uses for these products
would be forthcoming. Other aspects to study could include catalyst
separation and potential for reuse at a larger scale.

Properties
Essential fuel properties of the product
mixture obtained from oleic acid were determined previously.40 The cetane number was 86.9, the kinematic viscosity
at 40 °C was 3.14 mm2/s, the cloud point (CP) was
−1 °C, the pour point (PP) was −4 °C, the
oxidative stability by the so-called Rancimat test was 3.4 h, the
density at 15 °C is 791 kg/m3, and the wear scar in
the high-frequency reciprocating rig lubricity test is 299 μm.
Although no properties were determined here for the products derived
from the other fatty acids and alkenes, it can be observed that the
products with high amounts of alkane and lower amounts of alkenes
would likely have more problematic cold flow properties (higher CP
and PP) but improved oxidative stability, whereas the converse would
hold for the products with reduced amounts of alkane but therefore
greater amounts of alkenes. This generalization also depends on the
chain length of the starting material and thus the products, with
cetane numbers decreasing with the chain length44 and cold flow improving because of the lower melting points
of shorter-chain compounds.45

Summary
and Conclusions
The catalyst Ru3(CO)12 reacts with fatty
acids irrespective of the saturation level and chain length to give
the same product pattern. The most prominent single product is the
alkane with one carbon less than the parent fatty acid, whereas alkenes
with one carbon less make up the major part of the product mixture.
The alkene mixture consists of all possible positional and geometric
isomers for a given chain length. A mixture of alkyl aromatic compounds
with the number of components depending on the chain length of the
fatty acid starting material also arises and the greatest amount formed
with linoleic acid as the starting material. The degree of saturation
of the fatty acids appears to have a little to no influence on the
pattern of the products obtained but influences their relative amounts
significantly. Thus, in the presence of Ru3(CO)12, fatty acids and subsequent intermediates undergo a variety of reactions
which include decarboxylation, dehydrogenation, isomerization, hydrogenation,
and cyclization/aromatization as shown by the present reaction sequence
using oleic acid as the starting material. The reaction of alkenes
with Ru3(CO)12 affords the same product pattern,
albeit with the products containing the same number of carbons as
the starting material and with differing amounts compared to the fatty
acids as the starting material. The product mixtures likely possess
properties rendering them acceptable as diesel fuels, although the
properties likely vary in the starting material and resulting product
pattern. A further direction of research indicated by the present
work would be to define and optimize reaction conditions using Ru3(CO)12 as a catalyst to steer the reaction toward
certain desired products as well as exploring additional issues such
as the nature of the catalyst in the reaction and catalyst separation
at a larger scale. Thus, varying the starting material, also depending
on the fatty acid profile, offers the possibility of tailoring the
reaction toward products with specific properties.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Methods
All fatty acids were purchased
from Nu-Chek Prep, Inc. (Elysian, MN) and were of purity >99% as
confirmed
by random checks using NMR spectroscopy, Bruker (Billerica, MA) Avance
500 spectrometer operating at 500 MHz for 1H NMR with CDCl3 as a solvent, and/or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry,
Agilent Technologies (Palo Alto, CA) 6890 gas chromatograph equipped
with an HP-88 capillary column and coupled to Agilent Technologies
(5973 mass selective detector at 70 eV) of some materials. Alkenes
were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and also randomly
checked for advertised purity (≥98%, in most cases ≥99%;
verified by the GC–MS analysis). DMDS was also acquired from
Sigma-Aldrich, and Ru3(CO)12 (99%) was obtained
from Strem Chemicals, Newburyport, MA. All reagents were used as received.
Derivatization of the samples with DMDS was carried out as described
previously.46,47

Reaction Procedure
The catalyst, stored under inert
atmosphere, was used as received. The reactions were carried out under
inert atmosphere as described previously,40 albeit on a scale of 2 g (for oleic acid; 0.007 mol) with 0.018
g (2.81 × 10–5 mol; 0.4 mol % relative to oleic
acid) of Ru3(CO)12 under a nitrogen for 24 h
at 250 °C. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature
with catalyst separation; the product was washed three times with
