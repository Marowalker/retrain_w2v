A novel
heterogeneous catalytic method was developed for the
synthesis of coumarin and its derivatives using the Ti(IV)-doped ZnO
matrix forming catalyst Zn0.925Ti0.075O having
a high surface area and good Lewis acidity. The catalyst shows high
activity toward a broad spectrum of the substituted phenols with β-ketoesters
such as ethyl acetoacetate, ethyl butyryl acetate, ethyl benzoyl acetate,
and so forth in good yields over short reaction times during the synthesis
of coumarins. The methodology was further extended for the synthesis
of ayapin molecules. The catalyst also shows recycle activity up to
seven cycles with very good stability.

==== Body
Introduction
Coumarins are a class
of oxygen heterocycles, contributing in the
field of natural products which are medicinally important.1 Coumarin derivatives are utilized as intermediate
chemicals in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, insecticides,
food additives, fragrances, and cosmetics.2 Additionally, they are applicable as optical whitening agents, laser
colors, dyes, and fluorescent probes for the identification of biologically
important chemical species as medicinal stains.3 In the synthetic organic chemistry, the class of coumarin
compounds is useful for the synthesis of chromones, coumarones, fluorocoumarins,
and 2-acyl resorcinol.4 However, many important
drug molecules have coumarin moieties such as warfarin, calanolide
A, 667 coumate, novobiocin, ensaculin alexa 350, hymecromone, and
umbelliferone (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Drug molecules containing the coumarin motif.

In the past reports, novel and well-organized methodologies
have
been developed to prepare coumarin compounds. Currently, the number
of methods are available for the coumarin synthesis such as Pechmann
reaction,5 Knoevenagel condensation,6 Claisen rearrangement,7 Perkin,8 Wittig,9 Reformatsky,10 catalytic cyclization,11 flash vacuum pyrolysis,12 and so forth. Amongst all, Pechmann reaction is widely useful for
the synthesis of coumarin because of the simple starting materials,
mild reaction conditions, and excellent yields of the products in
short reaction times. Various catalysts such as mineral acids like
H2SO4, HCl, H3PO4, CF3COOH, HClO4, ClSO3H, PTSA, and oxalic
acid as well as Lewis acids such as ZnCl2, FeCl3, SnCl4, SnCl2·H2O, TiCl4, AlCl3, ZrCl4, InCl3, BiCl3, Sm(NO3)3, BF3·H2O, CAN, Cu(ClO4)2, BaCl2,
and NbCl5 were also reported in the conventional synthesis
of coumarin via Pechmann condensation.13 Similarly, different heterogeneous catalysts were also employed
for Pechmann condensation such as Al-MCM-41,14 Al-SBA-1 molecular sieves,15 Keggin structures
heteropolyacids,16 graphite-montmorillonite
K10,17 H14[NaP5W30O110],18 silica triflate,19 mesoporous zirconium phosphate,20 ZrOCl2·8H2O/SiO2,21 pentafluorophenylammonium triflate,22 periodic mesoporous silica chloride,23 melamine–formaldehyde resin-supported
H+,24 PEG-SO3H,25 poly(4-vinylpyridinium) hydrogen sulfate,26 PVP-supported phosphotungstic acid,27 poly(4-vinylpyridine)-supported copper iodide,28 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloroaluminate,
and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ionic liquid.29

Nowadays, scientists are paying considerable
attention to the invention
of nanomaterial-based catalysts having an extensive range of various
textural and microscopy properties. However, controlled synthesis
of nanostructures has received enormous attention in the heterogeneous
catalysis due to various surface properties of NPs by modifying their
composition, size, and shape.30 In recent
reports, coumarin and their derivatives were synthesized using various
nanocatalysts such as magnetically separable Fe3O4@SiO2@EtSO3H,31 zirconium(IV)-modified
silica@magnetic nanocomposites,32 with
various functionalities exerting Brønsted acidity-like CMK-5-supported
sulfonic acid,33 sulfated zirconia,34 sulfated SnO2,35 sulfated CexZr1–xO2,36 WO3–ZrO2 nanocomposites,37 and 12-tungstophosphoric acid supported onto ZrO2 (12-TPA/ZrO2).38 Nevertheless,
homogeneous-catalyzed methods suffer because of the formation of unnecessary
byproducts, long reaction time, the use of stoichiometric reagents/catalysts,
and the disposal of waste leading to environmental pollution. Similarly,
the drawbacks accompanying with the biphasic catalytic systems are
as the use of a toxic and costly catalyst, unsatisfactory yields and
harsh reaction conditions, tedious workups, activation of catalyst,
and longer reaction time. To overcome from all the aforementioned
limitations, there is a scope for the design of an inexpensive, efficient,
recyclable, and environmentally benign approach. Goswami39 had developed the catalytic protocol for Pechmann
condensation using ZnO and pyridine dicarboxylic acid together as
a dually activated organo- and nanocatalyst of various phenols and
β-ketoesters.

In the present research work, we have developed
a solid acid catalyst
(Zn1–xTixO NPs) to facilitate Pechmann condensation for the synthesis
of coumarin under mild reaction conditions. In the continuation of
the coumarin synthesis, ayapins were also synthesized using similar
reaction conditions. We have reported the catalyst Zn1–xTixO NPs for the synthesis
of fluorescein via the Friedel-craft’s acylation approach.40 The textural properties of Zn1–xTixO NPs show high surface
area and Lewis acidity characterized by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
surface area measurements and pyridine Fourier transform infrared
spectra. Further, roughly spherical morphology of Zn1–xTixO NPs was confirmed
by scanning electron microscopy.

Results and Discussion
Catalyst
Screening
The catalyst activity was tested
in the model reaction for the coumarin synthesis using EAA and phloroglucinol
with the prepared catalysts at 110 °C under solvent-free conditions,
and the results are presented in Table 1. Initially, in order to verify the role of the catalyst,
the reaction was performed without any catalyst for 24 h; no product
was obtained (Table 1, entry 1). ZnO showed poor reactivity toward Pechmann condensation
and gives traces of the product over 5 h (Table 1, entry 2). After that, Zn1–xTixO nanoparticles were
screened for their activity during the synthesis of coumarin, where
Zn0.975Ti0.025O gave very low yield (37%) of 3a (Table 1, entry 3) due to a low concentration of Ti(IV). Zn0.950Ti0.050O showed improvement in the performance under the
same reaction conditions, with the yield of 3a about
60% (Table 1, entry
4). Zn0.925Ti0.075O displayed the highest catalytic
activity of coumarin and yield 88% (Table 1, entry 5). Further, Zn0.900Ti0.100O showed no improvement in the yield (88%) of 3a (Table 1, entry 6).
Thus, Zn0.925Ti0.075O is found to be the best
catalyst for further optimization studies in the synthesis of coumarin
by Pechmann condensation.

Solvent Screening
The various solvents were also studied
for optimizing the reaction conditions during the synthesis of coumarin,
and the results are summarized in Table 2. Aprotic polar solvents such as dichloromethane
(DCM) and ethyl acetate gave only 24 and 16% yields of 3a, respectively, after 8 h (Table 2, entry 1 and 2), whereas, in the presence of acetonitrile
as a solvent, the yield of the desired product was enhanced to 37%
(Table 2, entry 3).
The protic polar solvents such as water and ethanol afforded the 41
and 63% yield of desired product 3a, respectively (Table 2, entry 4 and 5).
With nonpolar solvents such as toluene as well as high boiling point
solvents such as dimethylformamide (DMF), they do not show any conversion
even after prolonged reaction times (Table 2, entry 6 and 7). The maximum yield of 3a achieved was 88%, in solvent-free reaction conditions at
110 °C in a very short reaction time of about 3 h (Table 2, entry 8). At a lowered temperature
of 90 °C, the yield was reduced to 61% and requires 5 h for the
completion of the reaction (Table 2, entry 9). Furthermore, the reaction temperature maintained
at 130 °C; unexpectedly, reduction in the yield of 3a was observed under same reaction conditions (Table 2, entry 10). From the above set of observations,
it is proved to be solvent-free conditions, and temperature 110 °C
was suitable for the synthesis of coumarin (3a) under
the optimized reaction conditions.

Effect
of Catalyst Loading
The effect of catalyst loading
was studied by varying the mol % in the reaction with 5, 10, and 15
mol %, and the results are presented in Table 3. Initially, the amount of the Zn0.925Ti0.075O catalyst was 5 mol %, the yield is 67%, and requires
5 h time for the reaction (Table 3, entry 1). When the catalyst amount was increased
to 10 mol %, there is a significant increase in yield of about 88%
of 3a (Table 3, entry 2). However, upon increasing the catalyst amount to
15 mol %, there was no further improvement in the yield (88%) of the
product (Table 3, entry
3). Thus, 10 mol % Zn0.925Ti0.075O catalyst
was the most optimal for Pechmann condensation of ethyl acetoacetate
and phloroglucinol.

Substrate Scope
The excellent performance of the catalyst
system with 10 mol % Zn0.925Ti0.075O under solvent-free
conditions during the synthesis of coumarin encouraged us to elaborate
their applications for a broad substrate scope involving a variety
of activated phenols with various β-ketoesters at 110 °C.
As shown in Table 4, high yields of coumarins (3a–3x) up to 89%
were obtained upon reacting β-ketoesters with various phenols.
Initially, phloroglucinol, pyrogallol, 2-methyl resorcinol, orcinol,
4-chloro resorcinol, and resorcinol (1a–1f) on
reaction with EAA (2a) gives corresponding coumarins
in 76–89% yields (Table 4, entry 3a–3f). When m-methoxy phenol (1g) and m-cresol (1h) reacted with EAA, it requires longer reaction time (5
h) and gave the corresponding product with 69 and 65% yield, respectively
(Table 4, entry 3g–3h), whereas, p-cresol (1i) gave only 58% yields under similar reaction conditions (Table 4, entry 3i). However, the polycyclic aromatic compounds such as α-naphthol
(1j) reacted only with EAA and gave the corresponding
coumarin in low yields (Table 4, entry 3j). It is also observed that the catalyst
does not show any activity toward the nonsubstituted phenol. Afterward,
ethyl butyrylacetate (2b) smoothly reacted with various
phenols (1a–1g) and gave corresponding products
in good yields up to 87% (Table 4, entry 3k–3q) same as that of
EAA, while ethyl benzoyl acetate (2c) gave yield of the
corresponding product in 64–85% with various phenols (Table 4, entry 3r–3x). It is observed that the reaction of ethyl benzoyl acetate (2c) requires longer reaction of 5 h because of the low electrophilicity
of the carbonyl carbon due to the presence of the phenyl ring adjacent
to the carbonyl carbon. Similarly the naturally occurring ayapin derivatives
were also synthesized using sesamol (1k) and β-ketoesters
(2b–2c) under the standard reaction conditions
which yields of 68 and 63%, respectively (Table 4, entry 4a–4b). The above
substrate scope study reveals that, the Zn0.925Ti0.075O NPs displayed better catalytic activity in the synthesis of coumarin
and ayapin by Pechmann condensation with variously activated phenols.

Plausible Reaction Mechanism for the Synthesis of Coumarin
The reaction pathway for the synthesis of coumarin through Pechmann
condensation is represented in Scheme 1, and the mechanism for the reaction is assumed to
be the same as proposed by using Zn0.925Ti0.075O NPs as a Lewis acid.40 Initially, reaction
proceeds with the nucleophilic attack of the hydroxyl group of phloroglucinol
on the activated EAA, resulting in the formation of the intermediate
and byproduct ethanol. The formed intermediate rapidly undergoes cyclization
through Lewis acid-catalyzed intramolecular condensation and followed
by dehydration which yields 5,7-dihydroxy-4-methyl-2H-chromen-2-one.

Recyclability Study
The recycle
study of Zn0.925Ti0.075O NPs in the coumarin
synthesis as illustrated
in Figure 2; the reaction
was performed using EAA and phloroglucinol under standard optimized
reaction conditions as a model substrate for Pechmann condensation.
In repeated experiments, the catalyst was washed with ethanol and
dried at 100 °C and used without any activation. The results
of these experiments showed that the catalytic activity of Zn0.925Ti0.075O NPs did not decrease significantly
even after seven catalytic cycles. Thus, the catalyst was quite stable
under the reaction conditions. However, the decrease in the activity
could be due to handling losses of the catalyst after each run, as
the initial catalyst charges was only 10 mol %.

Stability of the Zn0.925Ti0.075O NPs
The stability of the Zn0.925Ti0.075O catalyst
was confirmed by studying the X-ray powder diffraction spectrum (XRD)
of fresh and used catalyst samples and is presented in Figure 3; the diffraction patterns
of the prepared catalyst and the fresh catalyst were found to be the
same and they show the high chemical stability of the Zn0.925Ti0.075O catalyst.

Conclusions
In summary, Zn1–xTixO NPs was reported as an efficient,
recyclable, and
heterogeneous catalyst for the synthesis of coumarin using Pechmann
condensation. Among the different Ti(IV)-doped ZnO catalytic systems,
Zn0.925Ti0.075O showed rapid activation of β-ketoesters.
The catalyst system was proven over a broad substrate scope with various
β-ketoesters and activated phenols under the optimized reaction
conditions. This synthetic methodology also extends for the synthesis
of ayapin derivatives from the sesamol and various β-ketoesters.
Zn0.925Ti0.075O NPs were stable and shows catalytic
performance even after seven runs without significant loss in the
% yield of the products.

Materials and Methods
All required
chemicals were purchased from Aldrich, Thomas Baker,
and Finar and used as received without any further purification. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded in the solvent
DMSO-d6 on a Bruker ADVANCE-III 500 MHz
spectrometer using TMS as an internal standard.

Synthesis of ZnO and Zn1–xTixO
NPs
The catalysts were
prepared by the solution-free mechanochemical method.41 In a typical experimental procedure, zinc acetate (50 mmol)
and oxalic acid (60 mmol) were mixed and ground together for 1 h at
room temperature. Next, the zinc oxalate dihydrate [Zn (C2O4)2·H2O] precursor was calcined
at 600 °C for 2 h in air to obtain ZnO NPs. The Zn1–xTixO catalysts were similarly
obtained by the addition of an appropriate quantity of titanium isopropoxide
in the preparation of the precursor. Zn1–xTixO containing 25, 50, 75, and
100 mmol Ti(IV) were synthesized.

General Procedure for Pechmann
Condensation
In a round
bottom flask, the mixture of phloroglucinol (2 mmol), EAA (2 mmol),
and Zn0.925Ti0.075O NPs (10 mol %) was heated
with constant stirring at 110 °C for the appropriate time. The
progress of the reaction was monitored by the thin-layer chromatography
analysis. After completion of the reaction, the mixture was dissolved
in ethyl acetate, and the catalyst was separated by centrifugation.
The solvent was then removed under reduced pressure, and the resulting
crude product was purified by recrystallization using ethanol.
