Industrial bubble
columns mainly operate in a heterogeneous flow regime and identifying
transition from homogeneous to heterogeneous flow is important. This
work addresses the determination of flow regimes with gas–liquid
systems in a bubble column. Various parameters of gas holdup, volumetric
mass transfer coefficient, drift flux, and pressure standard deviations
were investigated to precisely determine the superficial gas velocity
at the transition regime. For a column aspect ratio (H/D: static liquid height to column diameter ratio)
of 2.5 to 5, the transitional superficial gas velocity generally became
higher with lower liquid height. However, the reverse trend was observed
with a low density gas system due to the difference in force balance
acting around the bubble. The weak body force and drag force in a
lower axial position interrupted the mass transfer process. The experimental
results showed similar ranges of the transitional superficial gas
velocity regardless of the choice of parameter for detecting it. Because
there is no precise correlation about transition regime properties,
we proposed new correlations to predict both transition regime superficial
gas velocity and gas holdup by taking the intersection of the two
regimes. The correlations precisely captured the transition regime
properties within 15% deviations even in gas–liquid systems
that are not tested in this work.

1 Introduction
The bubble column is an important gas–liquid contactor. It
has been widely applied, such as in the petrochemical and mineral
processing industries as well as in biomass production, because of
their superior mass and heat transfer, simple construction, and flexible
operation under various reaction conditions.1−6 A bubble column consists
of a main body column and a gas sparger at the bottom of the column.
Gas is distributed through the gas sparger, and gas–liquid
flow development occurs upon introduction to the column. The bubble
column can be operated in batch, semibatch, or continuous modes. In
our work, batch operation of bubble column was analyzed. There are
two types of flow regimes in the bubble column operation: homogeneous
and heterogeneous.7,8 In the homogeneous flow regime,
each bubble is uniformly distributed, and the uniform rise in velocity
of each bubble results in limited frequencies of bubble coalescence.9 This flow regime is usually observed at a low
superficial gas velocity. The homogeneous flow regime can be classified
into monodispersed homogeneous and pseudohomogeneous flow regimes.10,11 The former has a flat local void fraction and the latter has a center-peaked
bubble size distribution. At a higher superficial gas velocity, the
flow regime shifts to the heterogeneous flow regime (or churn-turbulent
flow). In that regime, there is an improved turbulent motion of gas
bubbles. Higher gas input and the vigorous mixing of gas bubbles induce
repeated bubble coalescence in the column. There is a considerable
population of large bubbles, and so a wide distribution of bubble
size is observed. Therefore, in the homogeneous regime, a uniform
size of smaller bubbles can be observed, whereas larger bubbles are
obtained in the heterogeneous regime.

Understanding the range
of transition regimes is important in operating bubble columns with
various liquid and gas phases because the mass transfer behavior between
homogeneous and heterogeneous flow is considerably different. The
region of the transition regime depends on the column dimension, sparger
design, and gas–liquid properties. Previous work reported that
both the column diameter and column height affect the transitional
superficial gas velocity.12−14 It was demonstrated that the column diameter has an effect on gas
holdup for the column diameter column smaller than 0.15 m.15 For the column with a column diameter greater
than 0.2 m and a column height greater than 2.2 m, the aspect ratio
of height to diameter does not affect the gas holdup.16 Therefore, the aspect ratio with a smaller diameter or
height than these is important in observing the transitional superficial
gas velocity. The effect of gas–liquid property on the transitional
superficial gas velocity was also studied. It was understood that
the higher viscosity of liquid phase hinders the homogeneous regime
stability and reduces the gas holdup.17−19

A number of methods have been used in determining
the transition regime point. The gas holdup profile can be one of
the determining parameters because the trend of gas holdup profiles
differs between the two flow regimes along the superficial gas velocity.20 The concept of drift flux, which can be derived
with gas holdup and superficial gas velocity, can also predict the
transition point.21 A specific band (3–5
Hz) is used as evidence of the incipient transition regime in the
spectral analysis method based on the Fourier transform.22−24 In addition, a fractal method
utilizing cyclic slow and rapid stochastic phenomena was applied to
determine the flow regime transition.23,25

Although
there have been general studies on the transitional superficial gas
velocity, no definitive answer has been given to this problem specifically
when the gas–liquid phases and the aspect ratio vary. Previous
studies developed a model to predict the gas holdup at the transition
regime using small bubble velocity.26,27 By calculating
two parameters in their models, the transitional superficial gas velocity
could be determined. However, the transitional superficial gas velocity
presented in the literature digressed from experimental observation
and needed more accurate prediction.

Therefore, the purpose
of this work is to investigate the transitional superficial gas velocity
and to suggest an accurate model to predict the superficial gas velocity
at the transition regime. Experiments were carried out to identify
the superficial gas velocity at the transition regime of various gas
phases in the organic or aqueous bulk liquid phase. We did not employ
an air–water system as gas–liquid phases because many
studies have already investigated this system.17,24,27 In our work, the transition regime point
was measured by the gas holdup, volumetric liquid-phase mass transfer
coefficient, and drift flux profile. Furthermore, the pressure standard
deviation was applied to investigate the transition regime. The empirical
results of this work were compared with the predicted transitional
superficial gas velocity by using both prior correlations and our
proposed correlation.26,27 The comprehensive correlation
proposed here accurately predicted the gas holdup and the superficial
gas velocity by integrating the two models covering gas holdup at
homogeneous and heterogeneous flow regimes.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Transitional Superficial Gas Velocity
The transitional superficial gas velocity is an important issue in
the operation of an industrial bubble column. Because homogeneous
and heterogeneous flow regimes have different hydrodynamic properties,
different equations estimating mass transfer parameters should be
applied based on the delicately determined transitional superficial
gas velocity. Thus, in this work, numerous experiments determining
the transitional superficial gas velocity with various methods were
carried out to confirm the accuracy of the data. After the investigation
of the empirical transitional superficial gas velocity, the results
were compared with an existing model in prior studies and a new estimation
model was developed to precisely predict the transition regime.26,27

2.2 Gas Holdup
Gas holdup is an important design parameter, as it has a significant
influence on the column hydrodynamic behavior and mass transfer. For
the homogeneous flow regime, gas holdup quickly increases as the superficial
gas velocity rises until it reaches the transitional superficial gas
velocity. Once the superficial gas velocity reaches the transitional
superficial gas velocity, the ascending rate of gas holdup is reduced
and the transition point from homogeneous to heterogeneous regime
can be clearly recognized. The determination of the transitional superficial
gas velocity is shown in Figure 1 using a plot of gas holdup vs superficial gas velocity.
Although the gas holdup itself did not show a linear relationship
with the whole range of superficial gas velocity, the two separate
linear estimations provide the superficial gas velocity at the transition
point.

Figure 1 Determination of transitional
superficial gas velocity (Ar–monoethylene glycol (MEG) 25 wt
% system).

The investigation of the gas holdup data over different
gas–liquid phases is illustrated in Figures 2–4. The determination of the overall transition regimes in the
gas holdup can be referred to the Supporting Information (Figure S1). The regime transition can be observed
as the superficial gas velocity varies between 0.03 and 0.08 m/s.
According to the observation, the increasing liquid height resulted
in the reduced transitional superficial gas velocity. It is concurrent
with previous observations that higher static liquid heights induce
lower transition regime velocities.13,20,28 Overall, the gas holdup was lower at the n-hexane system than at the MEG 25 wt % system regardless
of gas species because of the higher viscosity of the MEG 25 wt %
system.

regime determined by the slope of helium gas holdup.

2.3 Volumetric
Mass Transfer Coefficient (kla)
Detecting the change of the volumetric mass transfer coefficient
is another way to determine the transitional superficial gas velocity.
The result of kla is
displayed in Figures 5–7. The determination
of the overall transition regimes by the kla can be seen in Figure S1. The result was similar to that of the gas holdup case. The n-hexane system showed higher mass transfer coefficients
than the system of MEG 25 wt % solution. Also, the increasing liquid
height decreased the transitional superficial gas velocity.

regime determined by kla with argon gas.

Figure 7 Individual transition
regime determined by kla with helium gas.

Regarding the experiments using n-hexane and helium,
however, mass transfer was improved, although the static liquid height
increased. The result using argon and nitrogen as a gas phase did
not show this reverse tendency. The reason why the elevated static
liquid height gave better mass transfer seems to be derived from the
smaller density of helium. By taking a closer look at a force acting
in the bubble, there is drag force (FD), body force (FB), pressure force (FP), virtual mass force (FVM), and lift force (FL).29 The following equations are detailed expressions
of each force 1   2   3   4   5  where CD, CL, and CVM are coefficients of each force.

A condition
of the same superficial gas velocity and the same liquid was applied,
and only the gas phase was varied. vl is
negligible because vl is mainly affected
by liquid property and vg.2929 The variation of
pressure is governed by the axial position, and so FP is not greatly affected by changing the gas-phase component.
Also, correlations in previous studies on bubble diameters did not
consider gas properties of density and viscosity.30,31 If
a bubble size is independent of the axial position, the only variable
parameters are vb and mb. Thus, the change of FP, FVM, and FL is negligible.
The FB of helium is significantly smaller
than that of the other gases because of the low density of helium
(argon: 1.661; helium: 0.16442; nitrogen: 1.1496 kg/m3 at
room temperature and atmospheric pressure).

Average bubble rise
velocity was investigated to examine the change of FD, and the result is illustrated in Figure 8. In the experiment using argon as a gas
phase, the average bubble rise velocity for the entire column was
higher at all superficial gas velocity conditions for the experiment
using an H/D ratio of 5 (hatched
block and white block in Figure 8a). Therefore, better mass transfer can be observed
at lower static liquid height because a slower average bubble rise
velocity induces more gas–liquid mass transfer opportunity.

Figure 8 Average rise velocity
with respect to different axial positions (velocity measured position/static
liquid height of experiments): (a) argon and (b) helium.

For the experiment using helium as a gas phase, however, the static
liquid height increase gave reduced average bubble rise velocity (Figure 8b). This is the reason
why the improved kla was
observed even though the static height was expanded. Additional evidence
of the mass transfer increase can be obtained by splitting measuring
regions of average bubble rise velocity. For the argon experiment,
the average bubble rise velocity in the range of 0–2.5 H/D axial position was lower than that
in the range of 2.5–5 H/D axial position as the superficial gas velocity increased (see the
black and gray blocks in Figure 8a). However, the average bubble rise velocity gradually
decreased as the axial position increased for the helium experiment.
This decrease in the average bubble rise velocity can increase the
drag force in eq 1, which
acts in the opposite direction of bubble rise. As a result, the different
flow development tendency provides different mass transfer behaviors.
With this overall perspective, the rise of static liquid heights may
grow the kla when less
dense gas is used.

2.4 Drift Flux
The drift flux method was introduced by Wallis
to analyze flow hydraulics and physical properties of two-phase systems.21 Drift flux can be given by the following equation 6  The transitional superficial gas velocity can also
be obtained by tracing the change in the slope of the gas holdup vs
drift flux curve.13,23,32 Results
of the investigation using drift flux analysis are illustrated in Figures 9–11. The overall transition regime
with different gas–liquid systems was displayed in Figure S2. The overall trend of the effect of
static liquid height and different gas–liquid systems on the
transitional superficial gas velocity was concurrent with the former
selection of gas holdup because the drift flux analysis is based on
the gas holdup in eq 6.

regime determined by drift flux

2.5 Pressure Standard
Deviation
Another method for determining the transitional
superficial gas velocity is to investigate pressure fluctuations.
There have been several studies using statistical analysis to identify
the hydrodynamics of a bubble column.33−35 The main characteristic of a homogeneous flow regime
is the generation of a uniform bubble size at the gas sparger. Thus,
there will be small pressure fluctuations at the lower point of the
column. However, at a higher axial position, bubble size distribution
will gradually become disordered because a bubble has the possibility
of coalescing with others during the bubble rise. Therefore, it can
be inferred that the intensity of pressure fluctuation progressively
increases along the rising axial position. However, in the heterogeneous
flow regime, a clear difference compared to the homogeneous flow regime
is the wide range of bubble size distribution through the whole column.
Pressure fluctuations are independent of the axial position due to
the release of large bubbles near the gas sparger and the eddies in
the column. Hence, the investigation of pressure fluctuations can
be utilized as another tool for finding the transitional superficial
gas velocity.

Figure 12 shows that the pressure fluctuation is measured by obtaining
pressure standard deviations with different axial positions (H/D = 0.1, 1, 2.5, and 3.5). Another figure
containing empirical data using argon and helium is shown in the Supporting
Information (Figure S3). The left side
of the figure represents the homogeneous flow regime, and the other
side represents the heterogeneous flow regime. The empirical data
of the pressure standard deviation showed an upward tendency as the
axial position increased in the homogeneous regime. The transition
regime began with the red lines in Figure 12a,c. No relationship between axial position
and pressure standard deviation was observed in the graph representing
heterogeneous flow regime. Observation of the pressure standard deviation
in the other gas–liquid systems, and all the empirical results
in the above sections about the transitional superficial gas velocity
are displayed in Table 1. Various gas–liquid systems showed different transitional
superficial gas velocity. The empirical data with various methods
for determining the transition regime showed that the transitional
superficial gas velocity decreased with the rising static liquid height.
There was no big difference between the transition regime velocities
from the four different analysis methods. Drift flux and gas holdup
have similar tendency because drift flux is a term combining superficial
gas velocity with gas holdup. A big difference between gas holdup
and liquid-side mass transfer coefficient is present with the bubble
diameter. If a gas slug or gas cap is created in a bubble column,
liquid-side mass transfer is significantly reduced, although gas holdup
is not affected a lot.36 Because the gas
slug or gas cap cannot be created in this work, the transitional superficial
gas velocity was similar with the four different analysis methods.
Thus, the average of the transition regime velocities was employed
to propose a correlation of the transitional superficial gas velocity
in the following section.

gas–liquid systems (measured at 5 H/D axial position): (a, c) homogeneous flow regime
and (b, d) heterogeneous
flow regime.

2.6 Correlation of the Transitional Superficial Gas Velocity
There have been a few studies concerned specifically with transitional
superficial gas velocity, and each of their models was proposed to
determine the transitional gas holdup and the small bubble velocity.
By using the two parameters, the transitional superficial gas velocity
could be obtained.26,27 In our experiment, the dispersed
bubble diameter was small enough to be recognized as a small bubble
near the superficial gas velocity of 0 m/s. Therefore, the average
bubble rise velocity at this condition can be expressed as the small
bubble velocity. The transitional superficial gas velocity, the gas
holdup at the transition regime, and the small bubble velocity predicted
by the previous models were displayed with our experimental data in Figure 13.26,27 The three calculated parameters appeared with a significant difference
between the experiments and the model predictions. Thus, a new correlation
was proposed, as described next.

Figure 13 Comparison
of transition regime parameters: (a) transitional superficial gas
velocity; (b) gas holdup at transition point; and (c) small bubble
velocity.

The relation between the gas
holdup and the superficial gas velocity was analyzed. Because a lot
of previous literature expressed gas holdup as a power relationship
with superficial gas velocity, the value of the exponent for gas holdup
was considered.26,37,38 7  It was found that exponent
“a” was in the range of 0.7–1.2
for the homogeneous flow regime, and it was within 0.4–0.7
for the heterogeneous flow regime.39 In
another study, 1.2 was used for the exponent in the homogeneous flow
regime and 0.4 in the heterogeneous flow regime to provide a transition
regime correlation.26 However, it was also
reported that the value operating in the homogeneous flow regime was
0.58.40 Gandhi and Joshi collected all
of the published 3374 data points over the past 45 years regarding
the measurement of the gas holdup.

We also estimated the exponents
by utilizing our 270 data points, as shown in Table 2. Because the column dimension may influence
the gas–liquid flow up to the aspect ratio of 5, only the transitional
superficial gas velocity measured at the aspect ratio of 5 was applied
for developing a prediction model.9,41 The average
value of a was 0.8422 operating in the homogeneous
flow regime and 0.557 operating in the heterogeneous flow regime.
The slope change at the transition regime can be well-defined between
the gas holdup and the superficial gas velocity, as shown in Figures 2–4. Therefore, based on the experimental data, the
correlation to estimate the gas holdup for each flow regime was established
to find the transitional superficial gas velocity. Because gas and
liquid viscosity, surface tension, and density have a considerable
influence on the gas holdup, their properties were included as a parameter.
The gas holdup prediction models for each regime were built by multiple
regressions, as shown below.

In the homogeneous flow regime 8  In the heterogeneous flow regime 9  The
parity plot between the experimental and the estimated value is shown
in Figure 14 to confirm
the validity of both correlations. All of the data were within the
range of 15% error. The intersection between the two gas holdup models
for the homogeneous and the heterogeneous flow regimes can be the
gas holdup at the transition regime. To simplify the equation, the
model equation can be expressed as a power law model 10   11  Because A, B, a, and b were
known values in eqs 8 and 9, the intersection point can be easily
expressed as 12   13  Therefore, the equation to estimate the specific
gas holdup and the superficial gas velocity values at each transition
regime can be obtained 14   15  eqs 14 and 15 were derived by eqs 8 and 9 for
the parameters having the following experimental ranges; ρg = 0.16442–1.661 kg/m3, ρl = 655–1027.71 kg/m3, μ = 0.000326–0.001289
Pa s, and σ = 0.0184–0.071 N/m. The comparison of experimental
and correlated data is illustrated in Figure 15. Data from previous literature were compared
with the calculated values from our proposed correlations.14,22,42,43 The
new model revealed a good prediction capability for the gas–liquid
systems like water–air and 80 wt % MEG–air that are
not tested in this work. The calculated values of superficial gas
velocity and gas holdup at the transition regime fitted well with
the empirical data. Therefore, the proper selection of the value of
exponent a in superficial gas velocity gives a proper
prediction of superficial gas velocity and gas holdup at the transition
point. Because this experiment was carried out at ambient conditions,
the given correlations may not work for pressurized systems. More
investigations in various conditions should be carried out to further
improve the correlations.

and calculated transitional superficial gas velocity (estimated by eq 15).

3 Conclusions
This work was performed to accurately determine
the transitional superficial gas velocity with several different gas–liquid
systems. Several different methods employing gas holdup, volumetric
liquid-phase mass transfer coefficient, drift flux, and pressure standard
deviation showed similar results in the transitional superficial gas
velocity. Increase in the static liquid height can lower the transitional
superficial gas velocity. However, in a lower gas density case such
as with helium, it was observed that the increased static height caused
a higher transitional superficial gas velocity. The relationship between
gas holdup and superficial gas velocity was carefully observed to
develop a new model based on the empirical result. After establishing
a gas holdup model for the homogeneous and heterogeneous flow regimes,
a new model to predict superficial gas velocity and gas holdup at
the transition point was established. The established model displayed
an overall error of less than 15% when compared to the empirical results
of this work. By considering liquid and gas phase physical properties,
the proposed model offers flexible prediction capability for various
gas–liquid mass transfer systems.

4 Methods
4.1 Bubble Column Setup
The detailed design of the bubble column
experiment is illustrated in Figure 16. The transparent acrylic column had the inner diameter
of 0.2 m and height of 1.8 m. At the bottom of the column, a ring
sparger with 54 holes with a size of 0.001 m in diameter was installed
to provide a consistent distribution of the gas phase. The gas sparger
was made of 3/8″ stainless steel pipe and has a diameter
of 0.12 m. A mass flow controller (MFC-Korea, TSCD245, Korea) was
used to provide the gas phase. The superficial gas velocity was set
to more than 0.01 m/s to avoid gas weeping near the gas sparger. To
cover both homogeneous and heterogeneous flow regimes, superficial
gas velocities were varied up to 0.133 m/s. To detect a pressure fluctuation
during the experiment, four pressure sensors (Sensys, PHPG 0003BCTG,
Korea) that offered ±0.035% precision under the range of 0–3
bars were installed at different axial positions. During the experiment,
dynamic mass flow controller (MFC) signals were continuously recorded
and delivered to the PC.

the bubble column.

4.2 Measurement Method
For the liquid phase, monoethylene
glycol (MEG) aqueous solutions and n-hexane were
used. Because pure MEG has a high viscosity, 25 wt % MEG aqueous solution
was employed. Each of helium, nitrogen, and argon was chosen as a
gas phase to cover various gas densities. All experiments were carried
out in batch mode and experimental condition was atmospheric pressure
and room temperature. The liquid phase was filled before the experiment,
and the gas phase was injected through the sparger by MFC. The void
fraction of the gas holdup (εg) was calculated by
the ratio of the aerated liquid height to the difference between the
static and the aerated liquid heights.

The volumetric mass transfer
coefficient (kla) was
determined by applying dynamic dissolved oxygen (DO) absorption and
desorption method. There were already frequent references using a
DO probe to obtain kla.44,45 Ahead of the experiment, oxygen gas was sufficiently
provided to achieve the saturated condition to desorb the remaining
gas in the liquid phase. After the complete replacement of the system
gas by oxygen, the object gas was distributed, and the variation of
DO in the system liquid was measured using a polarographic DO meter
(Hanna Instruments, HI98193). The collected DO data were transferred
to the PC, and the experimental kla was calculated by the following equation36,46,47 16  Bubble velocity was measured by a stopwatch. Once
a bubble was released above the sparger, exact time measurement began.
The elapsed time was measured until the bubble passed the specific
destinations (axial position of H/D = 2.5 and 5). Because it is hard to differentiate which bubble is
a measuring objective, the first released bubble after the column
operation was observed. For the accuracy of the experiment, more than
10 bubble velocity measurements were made per each data point. After
the experiment, the remaining gas in the sparger was slowly released.
This condition was represented as a small bubble velocity at 0 m/s
superficial gas velocity. For the pressure deviation analysis, the
dynamic pressure during the experiment was recorded and analyzed by
the connected PC.
