Polyelectrolyte hydrogel fibers can
mimic the extracellular matrix
and be used for tissue scaffolding. Mechanical properties of polyelectrolyte
nanofibers are crucial in manipulating cell behavior, which metal
ions have been found to enable tuning. While metal ions play an important
role in manipulating the mechanical properties of the fibers, evaluating
the mechanical properties of a single hydrated hydrogel fiber remains
a challenging task and a more detailed understanding of how ions modulate
the mechanical properties of individual polyelectrolyte polymers is
still lacking. In this study, dark-field microscopy and persistence
length analysis help directly evaluate fiber mechanics using electrospun
fibers of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), chitosan (CS), and ferric ions
as a model system. By comparing the persistence length and estimated
Young’s modulus of different nanofibers, we demonstrate that
persistence length analysis is a viable approach to evaluate mechanical
properties of hydrated fibers. Ferric ions were found to create shorter
and stiffer nanofibers, with Young’s modulus estimated at a
few kilopascals. Ferric ions, at low concentration, reduce the Young’s
modulus of PAA and PAA/CS fibers through the interaction between ferric
ions and carboxylate groups. Such interaction was further supported
by nanoscale infrared spectroscopy studies of PAA and PAA/CS fibers
with different concentrations of ferric ions.

1 Introduction
Polyelectrolyte
nanofibers produced through electrospinning have
been extensively investigated as promising candidates to mimic the
fibrous network of extracellular matrix (ECM).1−10 These nanofibers provide cross-linked networks to support cells
in differing environments (e.g. pH, temperature, and ionic strength).11−14 The mechanical properties of polyelectrolyte nanofibers and spatial
arrangements of the fibrous polymer networks play an important role
in manipulating cell behavior, as they can affect cell attachment
and spatial distribution.15−17 While much effort has been devoted
to investigating the relationship between cell behavior and the mechanical
properties of polyelectrolyte nanofiber networks, measuring and controlling
the mechanical properties of a single hydrated nanofiber remains an
arduous task. Mats of electrospun fibers are commonly used to get
an average Young’s modulus and tensile strength. On the other
hand, the mechanical properties of individual nanofibers have been
probed using a combination of atomic force microscopy (AFM) and optical
microscopy techniques.18 Namely, the AFM
tip was used to apply pressure on the fiber anchored on the microridges
of an optical adhesive substrate. This method makes it possible to
determine the viscoelastic properties of single electrospun fibers
but requires a tedious experimental setup. Furthermore, the existing
literature indicates that studies mostly focus on dry fibers, despite
the fact that the mechanical properties of hydrated fibers would be
more in line with the interest in understanding the fibrous network
in ECM, which is composed of hydrated polyelectrolyte fibers. Therefore,
a simple and versatile approach to measure the mechanical properties
of hydrated polyelectrolyte fibers is of prime interest to broaden
the applications of electrospun polyelectrolyte fibers in tissue engineering.

An indirect, yet effective, approach to evaluate the mechanical
properties of hydrogel fibers in solutions (i.e., hydrated fibers)
is measuring the bending stiffness in the form of bending persistence
length (Lp). Bending Lp is defined as the length along a polymer over which
its tangent angle becomes uncorrelated under thermal fluctuations.19−21 The more rigid a polymer fiber is, the larger its bending Lp. The bending Lp of linear biopolymers (e.g., DNA, actin filaments, and microtubules)
has been determined from images obtained from various microscopy techniques
including electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy.19−24 In these systems, bending Lp has been
determined from various configurations of freely fluctuating polymers
in solution or surface-adsorbed polymers. For example, a recent study
by Nakielski and colleagues used a similar methodology to measure
bending stiffness of core–shell electrospun fibers in aqueous
solutions.24 The bending Lp was obtained from configurations of fibers in solutions
where the changes in bending stiffness of the core–shell nanofibers
were influenced by Brownian motion and thermal fluctuations as opposed
to bending motions influenced mainly by bending stiffness under otherwise
controlled parameters. The Young’s moduli of the hydrated fibers
obtained through the bending Lp measurement
and AFM were comparable (several to 10 kPa). Electrospinning produces
polymeric fibers using an external electrostatic field to accelerate
and stretch a charged polymer jet.4,25−33 Both modeling and direct observation show that the jet grows rapidly
into an electrically driven bending instability before it reaches
the collector.28,33,34 We consider that with fixed electrospinning operation parameters
(e.g., voltage, spin distance, and polymer feeding rate) and controlled
polymer solution properties (i.e., electrical conductivity and polymer
concentration), the bending Lp of the
collected fibers reflects the modulus of the fibers in a hydrated
state.

Here, we performed a proof-of-concept evaluation of the
mechanical
properties of single electrospun hydrogel fibers using dark field
microscopy and bending Lp analysis with
a recently developed software, persistence.19 A model system of electrospun nanofibers was produced from a solution
of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), chitosan (CS), and metal ions.32 PAA is an anionic polyelectrolyte with carboxylate
functional groups on top of a hydrocarbon backbone.35,36 The flexible cationic polysaccharide CS interacts with PAA through
ionic cross-links for improved stability in varying pH ranges.37 The metal ions have been shown to provide electrospun
nanofiber networks with further structural stability via electrostatic
attractions.11−14 Because CS can interact with PAA through electrostatic interactions
and metal ions have been demonstrated to improve hydrogel stability
and mechanical properties,12,38 it is expected that
fibers containing CS and metal ions would have larger bending Lp (i.e., be stiffer) than PAA fibers. Adding
ferric ions may further affect the bending Lp of both PAA and PAA/CS fibers.

In this study, four
types of fiber systems (pure PAA, PAA with
increasing concentration of ferric ions (Fe3+), PAA/CS,
and PAA/CS with increasing concentration of ferric ions) were used
to investigate the impact of ferric ions on the mechanical properties
of PAA and PAA/CS fibers. The bending stiffness and bending length
were measured using a dark field microscope. The Young’s moduli
of PAA and PAA/CS fibers with different concentrations of ferric ions
were calculated using the bending persistence length and the geometry
of electrospun PAA and PAA/CS nanofibers. Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectroscopy and infrared nanospectroscopy (nanoIR) were used
to examine the nanofiber structures and composition.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Ferric Ions Modulate the
Bending Stiffness, Average Length,
and Young’s Modulus of Hydrogel Fibers
PAA and PAA/CS
fibers with different concentrations of ferric ions (0, 0.04, 0.07,
and 0.1 wt % related to polymers) were produced through electrospinning
polymer solutions with ferric ions (Figure 1A). The distance between the spinneret and
collecting electrode was reduced to collect hydrated hydrogel fibers. Figure 1B is a scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) image of dry PAA/CS fibers without ferric ions, where
individual fibers attach without being fused. Images of PAA/CS fibers
with different concentrations of ferric ions collected at a reduced
collecting distance are provided in Figure 1C–E. The images clearly show that
fibers fuse at the contact point because they are hydrated. The diameters
of the fibers were obtained by averaging the diameters of 10 fibers
from measurements on the SEM images. It was found that the diameter
of PAA and PAA/CS fibers increased with ferric ion concentration (Figure S1) because of a combined effect of solution
conductivity and viscosity (Table S1).

To determine the bending stiffness of the nanofibers,
we visualized
the electrospun fibers on collectors at varying ferric ion concentrations
using dark-field microscopy. On the basis of these images (Figure S1), we measured the bending Lp of the nanofiber from two-dimensional angular correlation
analysis that captures semiflexible biopolymer mechanics (Figure 2A).19,39 Pure PAA electrospun fibers were found to be very flexible (evidenced
by low bending Lp) with long fiber lengths
(i.e., continuous fibers) (Figure 2B,C). Adding CS to PAA (5% in relation to the amount
of PAA) produced PAA/CS nanofibers with an average length (Lavg) of about 95.7 μm. The average bending Lp of PAA/CS fibers was higher than that of PAA
fibers, indicating that the electrostatic interactions between PAA
and CS increase the fiber stiffness. Ferric metal ions bind with both
CS and PAA through electrostatic interactions (Fe3+–COO–) and metal ion/nonpair electron complexing.14,38,40−42 However, the
interaction between CS and ferric ions was negligible in our studies
because CS was fully protonated in the preparation of the pre-electrospinning
solution at low pH (1).11,43 Therefore, we believe
that the increment of PAA/CS fiber stiffness upon the addition of
ferric ions is attributed to the interactions between the ferric metal
ions and PAA. Ferric ions increase the bending Lp and decrease Lavg of both PAA
and PAA/CS fibers (Figure 2B,C). This result demonstrates that ferric ions increase the
bending stiffness of the fiber through intermolecular interactions
between ferric ions and carboxylate groups. While the highest bending Lp and shortest Lavg of both PAA/CS fibers (Lp = 121.96 μm, Lavg = 44 μm) and PAA fibers (Lp = 125.95 μm, Lavg =
89 μm) were obtained with 0.1% ferric ion concentration, the Lp increasing slope of PAA fibers is larger than
that of PAA/CS fibers. In other words, ferric ions have a more profound
impact on the bending stiffness of the PAA fibers than on the PAA/CS
fibers. This may be attributed to the fact that the interactions between
CS and PAA screen the interactions between ferric ions and PAA.12,44,45

Young’s modulus of PAA and PAA/CS fibers at varying ferric
ion concentrations. Uncertainty bars in (B–D) indicate standard
error of the mean.

The presence of CS coincided
with higher bending stiffness and
shorter nanofibers. Interestingly, the bending Lp converges at 0.10% Fe3+. PAA/CS nanofibers were
more resistant to major changes in length and produced shorter fibers,
on average, regardless of the level of cross-linking. Presentation
of the data in the form of box plots revealed that length variations
were the widest at 0.04% concentration of metal ions in the PAA nanofibers
without CS. PAA nanofibers with metal ions and no CS showed overall
wider distribution of Lavg (Figure S3A). Average bending Lp box plot analysis revealed that both types of nanofibers
exhibit a similar variance (Figure S4B, Supporting Information). The electrostatic interactions created by the
ferric ions with multiple chains could compensate for the lack of
CS in the complex as well as support a steadier increase in bending
stiffness, benefitting from low steric hindrance or competition.14,38,40

We estimated the Young’s
modulus of PAA and PAA/CS nanofibers
with varying concentrations of ferric ions based on bending Lp and nanofiber diameter measurements obtained
through SEM images (see Materials and Methods for details) (Figure S4). The Young’s
moduli of PAA and PAA/CS fibers were within a range of several kPa
to tens of kPa (Figure 2D), which are comparable to that of bulk hydrogels and indicating
that our electrospun fibers exist in a hydrated state.46,47 In comparison, the Young’s modulus of a single dry nanofiber
was measured in a range of MPa to GPa using AFM through a three-point
bend test, where a force was applied to the nanofiber along a small
parallel area.48−50

It is interesting to note that the Young’s
modulus decreases
with increased ferric ion concentration, which is contradictory to
the common assumption that ferric ions will cross-link PAA and increase
the Young’s modulus (Figure 2D). We believe that ferric ions at low concentration
are not able to interact with carboxylate groups from separated PAA
chains. Instead, ferric ions interact with carboxylate groups in one
PAA chain, reducing the intermolecular interactions of PAA chains
and leading to larger nanofiber diameters. The absence of intermolecular
interactions of PAA chains is also suggested by viscosity measurements
where the viscosity of PAA/ferric ion solutions has negligible increase
with ferric ion concentration. On the other hand, PAA chains will
be cross-linked by ferric ions at high concentration (i.e., 1%), which
is suggested by the gelation of the solution. The Young’s modulus
change of PAA/CS fibers with ferric ions reflects the impact of CS
on the fiber mechanical properties at low concentration where the
Young’s modulus of PAA/CS is higher than that of PAA fibers
because of the interaction of PAA and CS through electrostatic interactions.
Similar to the effect on PAA fibers, ferric ions interact with carboxylate
groups and screen the interactions between carboxylate groups (on
PAA) and ammonium groups (on CS), leading to a reduced Young’s
modulus with ferric ion concentration. It should be noted that unlike
bending stiffness, Young’s modulus is dependent on the fiber
geometry (eqs 2 and 3). PAA and PAA/CS nanofibers become thicker with
increasing Fe3+ (Figure S1),
leading to an overall decrease in the estimated Young’s modulus.
Repulsion among the positive charges of CS and metal ions may affect
the nanofiber diameter as Fe3+ interacts with carboxylate
groups on PAA chains and screens the PAA/CS interactions. This would
explain why the nanofiber diameter increases with increasing ferric
ions, which results in decreased Young’s modulus, while bending
stiffness increases as observed in our results (Figure 2).

2.2 Inhomogeneous Distribution
of Ferric Ions Influences the Carboxyl
Group Band Shifts of PAA in PAA and PAA/CS Nanofibers
The
infrared spectra of the nanofibers are well aligned with previous
reports with a signature of the carboxyl group of PAA at ∼1695
cm–1, which experiences a slight shift to 1699 cm–1 in the presence of CS only (Figure 3). For the fibers of PAA interacting with
the ferric ions and PAA/CS interacting with ferric ions, the carboxyl
band at ∼1710 cm–1 did not shift significantly.
We note that the 4 cm–1 spectral resolution limit
of the measurement may prevent the identification of smaller shifts.
A significant decrease in the amide I and II IR bands of CS at 1649
and 1600 cm–1, respectively, and increase of the
absorption of NH3+ at 1640 cm–1 upon PAA/CS interactions have been previously reported,40,51−55 which were not observed in our study, likely due to the full protonation
of CS. However, in the PAA/CS fiber, a slight change in the broad
band at 2200 cm–1 suggests nonetheless the presence
of NH3+ ions from CS in the fibers.

of (A) PAA/CS solutions with increasing concentrations
of ferric ions and (B) PAA solution with increasing concentrations
of ferric ions.

Next, we investigated
local changes within the fibers by using
nanoIR. NanoIR measures the photothermal expansion of the material
in contact with the AFM tip at each wavelength emitted with the infrared
laser.56 In the range of the laser (1540–1800
cm–1), the ∼1610 cm–1 band
of the carboxylate ions and the ∼1650 cm–1 band of C=O stretching and ∼1710 cm–1 band of the carboxyl group could be studied. We first collected
AFM topography images of the fibers (Figure S5), which revealed the presence of contact points (Figure S5B) and of clusters of various sizes along the fibers
(Figure S5C,D) after addition of the ferric
ions. The composition of the nanofibers and clusters was examined
by collecting nanoIR spectra at different locations (Figure 4). NanoIR is not tight to 4
cm–1 spectra resolution of the FTIR as the cantilever
measures the photothermal expansion of the sample for each wavelength
emitted by the laser, which was swept with steps of 1 cm–1. The nanoIR spectra were deconvoluted to assess the variations of
the PAA carboxyl band in the fibers. The results indicated that the
carboxyl band shifts from 1709 cm–1 in the PAA and
PAA/CS fibers without ferric ions to up to 1715 cm–1 in the PAA/CS fiber with 0.1% ferric ions. Hence, the change in
Young’s modulus is corroborated by a molecular change in the
carboxyl group of PAA in the presence of ferric ions. Comparing to
the sub-band at 1680 and 1733 cm–1 (gray curves
in Figure 4E–H),
the intensity of the carboxyl band also increases in the fibers with
higher content in ferric ions. We visualized the variations in the
carboxyl band across the fibers by fixing the illumination wavelength
of the laser at 1710 cm–1 to obtain a chemical map.
The images, presented in Figure 4A–D, reveal inhomogeneities in composition,
especially at the cluster sites. Particularly, in Figure 4C, a lower intensity along
the axis of the fiber was resolved, which was also noted in other
cases (not shown here). This could be due to a difference in the composition
of the core of the nanofiber. Overall, the clusters were found to
have a higher expansion when excited at 1710 cm–1 specifically at the center. This was not solely due to the higher
thickness of the cluster regions, as can be seen in Figure 4C where variations within the
cluster are the strongest. The corresponding nanoIR spectra also indicate
a large shift of the carboxyl group up to 1715 cm–1 in these regions, suggesting that the distribution of the ferric
ions may not be homogeneous throughout the fibers.

ferric ions (H). The nanoIR spectra of the clusters identified on
the PAA/CS fibers with ferric ions are presented in (J–L).

3 Conclusions
The mechanical properties of PAA and PAA/CS fibers with different
concentrations of ferric ions were investigated using persistence
length analysis. The Young’s modulus of the hydrated hydrogel
fibers calculated from bending Lp and
fiber diameter is in the range of several to tens of kPa, which is
consistent with the Young’s modulus measured directly using
AFM technology. Increase of the ferric ion concentration decreased
the Young’s modulus of PAA and PAA/CS fibers because of the
interaction of ferric ions with carboxylate groups. These interactions
were confirmed in nanoIR studies. Our work offers a technique of polymer
mechanical strength measurement in single nanofibers without requiring
complex, time-consuming methods related to the whole nanofiber flexibility
as opposed to a single area.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Nanofiber Synthesis by Electrospinning
PAA/CS nanofibers
were fabricated by electrospinning as shown in Figure 1A. In the pre-electrospinning solutions,
0.1 M FeCl3 and 6 M HCl were added to 0.568 g of 4.4% CS
in 25% acetic acid and stirred for 30 min to create a homogenous solution.
Next, 1.43 g of 35% PAA (Mw ≈ 240
000, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to make PAA/CS (mass ratio of 20:1).
Different 0.1 M FeCl3 amounts were used to make Fe3+ metal ion concentrations 0.04, 0.07, and 0.1% in solution
by molar of the carboxylate group on PAA. To avoid gelation between
Fe3+ and PAA, the pH was maintained at 1 by addition of
6 M HCl. Addition of deionized water at different amounts maintained
the solutions at total polymer concentration of 20%.

The solution
was loaded into a plastic syringe equipped with a 16 mm stainless
steel gauge needle. A high voltage supply was connected to the needle,
while a syringe pump supplied solution continuously. The electrospinning
process with applied voltages ranging between 10 and 12 kV was conducted
in air at room temperature. Continuous, homogeneous nanofibers were
obtained by adjusting the voltages applied during the process whenever
necessary. The collector was a piece of aluminum foil placed 25 cm
away from the tip of the needle, slightly shorter than the collecting
distance of the previous report to collect hydrated bend fibers.11 The as-spun nanofibers were dried at 40 °C
under vacuum and stored in a desiccator for later use.

4.2 Scanning Electron Microscopy
The morphology of the
fibers was characterized by SEM (Zeiss Ultra 55) by placing the electrospun
nanofibers on glass substrates. Prior to imaging, all samples were
sputtered with a thin layer of Au/Pb (Emitech k550). A working distance
of 6–10 mm and accelerating voltage of 5 kV were used for imaging.
The scale bar provided on the images was used to determine nanofiber
diameter measurements.

4.3 Microscopy Imaging and
Bending Mechanics Data Analysis
Electrospun nanofibers were
visualized using an Olympus BX51M dark-field
microscope equipped with a digital camera (ProgRes GRYPHAX model from
Jenoptik) and a 20× objective. Dark field images were processed
using ImageJ software (NIH) before persistence length analysis. Persistence19 was used to measure the average length (Lavg) and bending Lp of nanofibers. Bending Lp values were
calculated from best fits to two-dimensional average cosine correlation
[⟨C(s)⟩] (eq 1) analyses19 of nanofibers (N = 630–2200) using
OriginPro 8 software. Average cosine correlation, ⟨C(s)⟩, was obtained from the tangent
angles (θ) along the nanofiber segment length (s), with scaling factor (A) (eq 1). 1  

Young’s modulus (E) was calculated
by eq 2, where κ
and I denote flexural rigidity (or bending stiffness)
and moment of inertia of nanofibers, respectively, and kBT is the thermal energy. 2  

Moment of inertia
(I) of PAA or PAA/CS nanofibers
was calculated by eq 3 with the assumption of nanofibers as rodlike structures with radius r based on diameter measurement from SEM images (Figure 1B).24,39,57 3  

4.4 FTIR Spectroscopy
Infrared spectra of PAA/CS
nanofibers
were obtained on solutions, prior to electrospinning, with a PerkinElmer
Spectrum 100 series FTIR spectrometer in the range of 600–4000
cm–1. Settings for 4 cm–1 spectral
resolution were used. Four spectra were averaged for each measurement.
Nanofibers could not be used for individual detection of signals;
therefore, samples made of vacuum-dried solution (prior to electrospinning)
were used. Simulation through use of vacuum-dried membranes assured
that no components were lost during electrospinning. IR bands were
deconvoluted for composition studies using Fityk and Origin software.

4.5 Infrared Nanospectroscopy
Nanofiber sample
preparation
was modified for optimal nanoIR measurements. The fibers were deposited
onto silicon wafers. The substrate was selected because of the absence
of IR bands in the 1530–1810 cm–1 range.
Absolute ethanol was used to clean the wafers through a sonication
bath for 2 h before rinsing with deionized water. A half of each substrate
was covered with aluminum foil during deposition to maintain a clean
area to acquire background reference. Localized IR measurements were
acquired on a nanoIR2 platform (Anasys Instrument). Silicon (n-type)
cantilevers coated with gold on both sides (PR-EX-nIR2 k ≈ 0.07–0.4 N/m) were used for the nanoIR measurements.
The natural resonance of the cantilevers used ranged from 11 to 19
kHz with a spring constant of 0.1–0.6 N/m. A constant scan
rate of 1.0 Hz and 500 by 500 points were used for image collection.
For each sample, several AFM images and IR spectra at various locations
of the fibers were collected. Chemical images were acquired at 1710
cm–1, corresponding to the carboxyl group in PAA.
Local IR spectra were obtained on regions of interest in the fibers
and analyzed using Fityk and Origin software.

4.6 Ion Conductivity
Measurement
Solutions at varying concentrations
(0.1 M samples of 6 g) were placed in separate 15 mL EZ Flip conical
centrifuge tubes for ionic conductivity studies. The measurements
were carried out with a Thermo Scientific Orion 5 STAR A111 Benchtop
Meter.
