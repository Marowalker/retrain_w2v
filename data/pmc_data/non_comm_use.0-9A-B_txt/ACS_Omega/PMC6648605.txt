Pure transition-metal
compounds seldom produce luminescence because
of electron correlation and spin–spin coupling. The Pb-free
perovskite materials, C10H12N2MnCl4 and C5H6NMnCl3·H2O, were obtained by using pyridine-implanted manganese chloride
lattices. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction indicates their different
crystal structures. In C10H12N2MnCl4, MnCl4 cocoordinated with two pyridine molecules
forms a lattice composed of independent mononuclear structures with
paramagnetic behavior, which shows a clear emission band at 518 nm
from the lowest d–d transition of a single Mn(II) ion in the
octahedral crystal field. In C5H6NMnCl5·H2O crystal,
MnCl5·(H2O)x octahedron-cocoordinated with less pyridine molecules than 2 lead
to formation arris-share linear chains of Mn-ion octahedra, which
give emission band at 620 nm due to the ferromagnetic Mn pair, and
ferromagnetism. Pyridine incorporations in the transition-metal halide
lattice provide a new channel to modulate the electron correlation
and obtain materials with both luminescence and ferromagnetic properties.

1 Introduction
Halide
perovskites have recently attracted great attention because
of their remarkable optoelectronic properties such as long electron
diffusion performance, excellent absorption coefficients, and splendid
light-emitting and photovoltaic performance.1−4 This proves that the ionic crystal
also can work as the functional or photonic material. Although they
have such preeminent characteristics, most of the perovskite materials
involved heavy metals such as Pb element, which is poisonousness to
humans and the environment. Recently, the lead-free perovskite progress
has been considered out of their nonpoisonous character.

Transition-metal
binary compounds seldom produce luminescence because
of the electron correlation and spin–spin coupling.5 They usually exhibit antiferromagnetic behavior.
The ternary transition-metal compounds such as perovskites possess
rich electronic states and electronic properties but seldom luminescence
except doping in semiconductors. Hence, it is astonishing to find
a way to modulate the electronic structure of transition-metal compounds
and transform them into a luminescent material, which will open a
giant gate to rebuild the field of the optoelectronic technology.

Doping by transition metal ions like manganese makes perovskite
materials show several new features: tunable luminescence, nonlinear
optical molecular switching, and multiferroics, and sometimes these
performances can coexist.6−10 These remarkable properties make transition-metal-doped perovskites
have potential applications in sensors, optical devices, piezoelectrics,
and so forth.11,12

In addition, the inorganic
part of inorganic–organic perovskite
configuration in a certain direction separates the organic units to
constitute low-dimensional folium, which provides dimensionality confinement
for excitonics. That is to say, the inorganic–organic perovskite
luminescence has a close-knit relationship to crystal field, originating
from their polytropic structure such as (NH3(CH2)5NH3MnCl4) and (C10H12N2MnBr4 and C5H6NMnBr3).13,14

According to the ligand
field theory, four ligands encircled an
atom such as manganese and obtained an individual MnX42– tetrahedra cluster, and the unit forms a determinate
style while the around space is filled with the organic cations, so
the tetrahedrally coordinated manganese ions with the infirm strength
of field have an emblematic green emission.15,16 In this situation, the direct interaction within Mn ions can be
avoided because of the large distance between adjacent Mn ions; therefore,
the individual Mn ion dominates the optical transition. Six ligands
surround a Mn atom to form a MnX64–-independent
octahedral unit. The cluster obtained a linear chain crystal structure
by edge-share in a certain direction, and thus the distance in adjacent
Mn ions reduced in this certain direction. But in the orthogonal direction,
the organic molecules implant between Mn ions, the distance is enlarged
to form an anisotropic crystal structure. For the Mn-ion chains, the
structure of MnX64– provides a confinement
effect and influences the d–d transition and transition energy
of Mn ions, in which the MnX64– octahedral
structure is shown as a red emission due to the strong field strength.17,18 In our previous work on Mn doping in ZnSe nanobelt, the emission
band tuned in doped diluted magnetic semiconductors causes by manganese
aggregated whether it is single Mn ion or multiple Mn ions has been
observed. Like ZnSe quantum dots doped by Mn and Mn-doped Na2CaMg(PO4)2 to form Na2CaMg1–xMnx(PO4)2, in which x = 0.05–1.0.18−21 The emission band tuned by transforming the coordination has also
been observed in our previous work. It is worth noting that, the organic
cations govern the organic metal emissions in a majority of the situations,
and pressure-induced phase transformation may also influence the emission,
but both in an inconvenient way.22,23

Lately,
Brédas and Mohammed et al. present manufacturing
of the 2D MAPBBr3 thickness governable nanostructure by
using pyridine as a ligand.24 Bai et al.
also report fabrication of the Mn ion emission tuneable crystal structure
by using the pyridine impact manganese bromide lattice.14 Consequently, we take using pyridine as cations
into account to regulate the hybrid perovskite structure. Thus, we
present the preparation of pyridine-ligand organic–inorganic
perovskites based on manganese chloride. We acquire C10H12N2MnCl4 and C5H6NMnCl3·H2O crystals with a different
structure by controlling the pyridine dosage. The C10H12N2MnCl4 single-crystal emission at
518 nm attributes to Mn ion d–d transition, and in the C5H6NMnCl3·H2O single
crystal, the Mn ion cluster makes the emission band red-shift at 620
nm. Also, the C10H12N2MnCl4 crystal exhibits a paramagnetic character, while the C5H6NMnCl3·H2O crystal has a
ferromagnetic property. Combining the magnetism measurement result
and the emission band, we investigate the phenomenon.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Crystal Structure of C10H12N2MnCl4 and C5H6NMnCl3·H2O
With
the different mole ratios
of pyridine and MnCl2, the crystal shows various colors
under UV irradiation because of the polytropic coordination. To represent
the crystal structure, the structural data were collected by X-ray
diffraction (XRD) single-crystal analysis. The crystal structure of
C10H12N2MnCl4 and C5H6NMnCl3·H2O is shown
in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. Table 1 shows the details of single-crystal XRD
analysis depending on the varied pyridine concentrations.

In the C5H6NMnCl3·H2O crystal structure (the Cambridge Crystallographic
Data Centre deposition
number is 1899261), every Mn atom is encircled by five Cl atoms and
a crystal water, in which two Cl atoms share the edge that bonds with
the other adjoining Mn atoms, and a crystal water links the Mn atom
by a coordinate covalent bond as shown in Figure 1. The Mn–Cl distance ranges from 2.4934(10)
to 2.5877(6) Å; meanwhile, the Mn–O distance is 2.2262(14)
Å. The bond angles surrounding the Mn atom ranges from 88.53(2)
to 177.90(3) Å. It is much less than that in C10H12N2MnCl4. In the single-crystal structure,
MnCl3–·H2O octahedrons
arris-share to form linear chains along the b axis,
and pyridine molecules fill in space while it is vertical with the b axis.

In the C5H6NMnCl3·H2O compound, the Mn ion has sixfold coordination;
five Cl ions occupy
five peaks of the octahedron, of which four Cl ions arris-share with
the near Mn ion, and crystal water occupies the last peak by a coordinate
covalent bond with Mn ions. Two Mn ions form an Mn ion chain, and
it is the opposite ligand sites of the MnCl53–·H2O cluster. The Mn in C5H6NMnCl3·H2O is six-coordinated, and its
crystal structure space group, P21/n, belongs to monoclinic.

To enhance the dosage of
pyridine, we acquire the C10H12N2MnCl4 structure (the Cambridge
Crystallographic Data Centre deposition number is 1899262). In this
concentration, every Mn atom is encircled by four Cl atoms and two
pyridine molecules; it forms a unit octahedral cluster structure of
C10H12N2MnCl4, as shown
in Figure 1. The Mn–Cl
distance ranges from 2.3532(10) to 2.3711(9) Å. The band angles
around the Mn atom change from 105.08(4)° to 112.68(3)°.
These octahedral structures are layout directed at the a axis, which are different from the C5H6NMnCl3·H2O structure, and the pyridine molecules
fill up the space among the 2D structure along the plane of c axis. Thus, Mn ions are kept sixfold coordinated with
four Cl ions and two pyridines, and the adjacent Mn ions did not have
direct Mn–Mn coupling. The crystal structure space group of
the Mn 6-coordinated cluster is triclinic P1̅.
These octahedra separated by pyridines in the crystal structure lead
to a Jahn–Teller effect, making Mn ions show clear emission
related to the allowed d–d transition. The related single-crystal
XRD data are shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Simulated single-crystal structure XRD patterns of C10H12N2MnCl4 and C5H6NMnCl3·H2O.

Comparing the C5H6NMnCl3·H2O and C10H12N2MnCl4, the closest Mn–Mn distance in the C10H12N2MnCl4 (7.6243(19) Å)
structure is more
than twice the Mn–Mn distance observed in C5H6NMnCl3·H2O (3.6484(9) Å),
and it has pointed out the distorted crystal fields are coordinated
by Cl atoms and organic ligands, which also lead to Jahn–Teller
distortion in the C10H12N2MnCl4 lattice. Moreover, direct Mn–Mn magnetic coupling
shows up in C5H6NMnCl3·H2O, as shown in Figure 6B.

2.2 Optical Properties of C10H12N2MnCl4 and C5H6NMnCl3·H2O
In this
work, we obtained
the two single crystals (C10H12N2MnCl4 and C5H6NMnCl3·H2O); they can show different luminescence bands with different
pyridine amounts incorporated in the MnCl2 lattice. A pyridine
molecule can occupy one site of Cl ions as the coordination ligand.
Based on Reinhoudt’s empirical rule, the most effective intersystem-crossing
process needs the energy gap ≥5000 cm–1.25 About the pyridine molecule, the ground state
is 3A1, a triplet state is located at 33 001
cm–1, 3.68 eV, and it is higher than 4A1 and 4Eg states (23 256
cm–1) of Mn2+.23,26,27 In this situation, the ligand–metal
ion energy transfer could occur, depending on their energy locations.
Therefore, the absorbed photon energy by pyridine can transfer to
the Mn2+ ion effectively in the lattice. In another word,
the singlet state of pyridine that is higher than the low-lying triplet
state can transfer energy to the triplet state by nonradiative intersystem
crossing, according to the empirical rule, after which the energy
of the triplet state can transfer to Mn2+ ion’s 4A1 state, and in this distorted octahedral crystal
field, the d–d transition selection rule was relaxed, leading
to an high-efficient luminescence out of the d–d radiation
transition of the Mn(II) ion when no neighboring Mn ions are coupled
with absorbing Mn ions.

Figure 4A–D illustrates the absorption and related emission
spectra at ambient conditions of the C10H12N2MnCl4 and C5H6NMnCl3·H2O structures. The absorption spectra contain three
components: charge transfer between M–L, n−π transition,
and π–π transition in pyridine and the d–d
transition of the Mn ion in the as-formed crystal. Both of the absorption
spectra show the similar electronic migration from the low-lying state 6A1 to other excited states of Mn2+ ions
in the MnClx cluster, which form the C10H12N2MnCl4 and C5H6NMnCl3·H2O structure, and
there are two disparate groups of the band in the spectra for these
compounds: G-terms and D-terms.16,23,28 In C10H12N2MnCl4 crystal
absorption spectra, the strong absorption bands at 351 and 366 nm
belong to transitions of the D-terms 6A1 → 4E (D) and 6A1 → 4T2 (D). The other three bands belong to the G-term transitions 6A1 → 4A1,4E (G) (417 nm), 6A1 → 4T2 (G) (451 nm),and 6A1 → 4T1 (G) (531 nm). The luminescence band of C10H12N2MnCl4 is at 518 nm
because of the d–d transition for the single Mn ion in its
crystal field. For the C5H6NMnCl3·H2O crystal, the absorption has a very close profile,
for its similar symmetry mainly formed by Cl ions. The two intense
absorptions belong to transitions of the D-terms 6A1 → 4E (D) and 6A1 → 4T2 (D) and the other bands are attributed to G-term
transitions 6A1 → 4A1,4E (G) (418 nm), 6A1 → 4T2 (G) (450 nm), and 6A1 → 4T1 (G) (544 nm). The lowest 6A1 → 4T1 transition has a red shift from
531–544 nm to 620 nm. Because the charge transfer between Mn
and pyridine contributes minor to band red shift of the Mn d–d
transition, the observed giant shift of 6A1 → 4T1 in C5H6NMnCl3·H2O is hard to explain for the less pyridine coordination
number than C10H12N2MnCl4. The C10H12N2MnCl4 crystal
gives green emission at 2.39 eV, while the C5H6NMnCl3·H2O structure has emission at about
2.00 eV, far less than the Mn2+ d–d transition (EMn = 2.15 eV).10 Therefore,
it is suggested that for the similar crystal field, there is another
cause for the shifted d–d transition.

excitation spectra of C10H12N2MnCl4 (B,D) and C5H6NMnCl3·H2O (A,C). Emission spectra

With the different concentrations of pyridine in the lattice,
the
MnClx cluster has different ion distributions
in space, and it may play an important role in influencing the Mn–Mn
couplings and therein its photoluminescence (PL). In C10H12N2MnCl4, the Mn–Mn distance
is 7.64 Å and the direct spin coupling between the Mn ion and
neighboring resonant energy transfer between Mn ions is almost negligible,
so the lifetime of the d-state increased. Then, its radiation d–d
transition can happen together with the relaxed selection rule.

In contrast to C10H12N2MnCl4, the Mn–Mn distance is 3.65 Å in C5H6NMnCl3·H2O and the MnCl53–·H2O octahedron forms
linear chains by edge-sharing. These linear chains are separated by
the pyridine molecules with higher levels, which supply a spatial
confining barrier for the electron state in the Mn ion chains, which
at least reduced two directional electronic quenchings in the lattice.
In a previous report, we have found that the ferromagnetic coupling
between Mn ions in a semiconductor lattice can lead to a red-shifted
d–d transition, even in ionic crystal MnBr2.14,29 Therefore, the d–d red-shifted emission band has a similar
origin out of the ferromagnetically coupled pair in the C5H6NMnCl3·H2O, and we need to
verify if C5H6NMnCl3·H2O with the emission band at 620 nm has ferromagnetic behavior.30−32

2.3 Transition State from the C10H12N2MnCl4 Crystal to the C5H6NMnCl3·H2O Crystal
To control
the pyridine dosage of the C10H12N2MnCl4 crystal and C5H6NMnCl3·H2O crystal, a transition state
between them was obtained, and it has dual-emitting bands as shown
in Figure 5. In this
crystal, we assume that the C10H12N2MnCl4 and C5H6NMnCl3·H2O structure was formed with a penetration twin construction,
so a mixed crystal forms and produces the dual emission bands at 531
and 644 nm. Figure 5A–C illustrates the emission spectra and related absorption
spectra. It has absorption spectra similar to C10H12N2MnCl4 and C5H6NMnCl3·H2O. It is interesting that when
we excite the mixed crystal with 365 nm UV-light, it shows prominent
dual emission, while it only has an emission band at 525 nm when it
is excited by 300 nm UV-light. This indicates that the absorption
bands for the lattice containing the aggregated Mn ions or the individual
Mn ion have some difference, while the one with aggregated Mn ions
has a red-shifted band even at high levels.

penetration twin construction (A). Emission
spectra excited by the 300 nm UV lamp (B). Emission spectra excited
by the 365 nm UV lamp (C).

2.4 Magnetic Properties of C10H12N2MnCl4 and C5H6NMnCl3·H2O
To ascertain the relationship
of the Mn–Mn-coupled pair and ferromagnetism and the red-shifted
emission band, we measured the C10H12N2MnCl4 and C5H6NMnCl3·H2O magnetic hysteresis loops at room temperature by using a
vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), and the results are shown in Figure 6. The magnetic hysteresis loops of both samples were measured
in a magnetic field at about ±1 T. C10H12N2MnCl4 proves a paramagnetic profile, while
C5H6NMnCl3·H2O shows
strong ferromagnetic peculiarity, as shown in Figure 6, and the saturation magnetization value
is 0.252 × 10–3 emu, measured coercivity is
861.75 Oe (0.86 kOe), and the remanence is 8.71 × 10–3 emu. This result unambiguously demonstrates the ferromagnetism,
which can only be induced by the Mn–Mn ferromagnetic coupling
among Mn ions in C5H6NMnCl3·H2O, which means that the Mn–Mn coupled pair or cluster
rather than the single Mn ion d–d transition modified crystal
structure and crystal field generates the red emission at 620 nm.

2.5 PL Decay
Lifetime of C10H12N2MnCl4 and C5H6NMnCl3·H2O
We used an fs laser to measure
the PL emission lifetimes of C10H12N2MnCl4 (A) and C5H6NMnCl3·H2O (B). The curves are shown in Figure 7, and the decay was well fitted
with single exponential function Y = Y0 + A × exp(−x/t1), and the fitting lifetime of C10H12N2MnCl4 is 2.14 ns; while
the C5H6NMnCl3·H2O crystal lifetime is 1.49 ns, this is far less than the common lifetime
in the bulk which is milliseconds for the d–d transition in
the solid lattice. In the C10H12N2MnCl4 crystal, the large distance between Mn ions (7.6243(19)
Å) forbids the Mn–Mn coupling, and d–d transition
dominated the PL lifetime by fs excitation. However, in C5H6NMnCl3·H2O, the Mn–Mn
distance (3.6484(9) Å) is closer to generate Mn–Mn spin
coupling. Because of the inefficiency spin coupling and quenching
by water molecules in the lattice, the PL lifetime of the Mn pair
in the C5H6NMnCl3·H2O crystal is less than C10H12N2MnCl4. In the CdS/Mn nanobelt,16,33 the aggregated
ferromagnetically coupled Mn pair often has a longer lifetime than
the single Mn ion because of the strong sp–d hybridization
and spin–spin coupling, but for this halide compound, this
effect is strongly reduced because of the ionicity nature and water
remanence. Therefore, the lifetime for the d–d transition of
the Mn aggregate is reduced as compared to the single Mn radiation
emission.

Figure 7 PL decay lifetime curves of C10H12N2MnCl4 (A) and C5H6NMnCl3·H2O (B) excited by the 360 nm fs laser device.

In the transition-metal compound,
the local exciton formed from
the local d-state is often quenched by the resonant energy transfer
between transition ions via the hopping model.34 This relaxation mechanism causes a giant loss for the new
luminescence material development for they cannot show luminescence.
Moreover, these materials usually form antiferromagnetic properties
like the MnCl2·H2O crystal.5,35 Here, our technique by pyridine molecule incorporation may supply
a new technique to confine the Mn ion or Mn ion aggregation, reduce
the efficient quenching between Mn ions and the antiferromagnetic
coupling between ferromagnetic layers, then tune their optical and
magnetic properties, and finally find new luminescence materials and
ferromagnetic materials.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
we obtained C10H12N2MnCl4 and C5H6NMnCl3·H2O crystals by using the pyridine molecule mild implant into
the manganese chloride lattice. The single MnClx clusters confined by the small pyridine molecule lead to Jahn–Teller
distortion to form the C10H12N2MnCl4 crystal, producing the 518 nm emission band out of the d–d
radiative transition of the Mn ion. While the C5H6NMnCl3·H2O crystal possesses another conformal
confinement by pyridines, the MnClx cluster
chain forms and leads to the ferromagnetic coupling at the environment
atmosphere, whose emission band red-shifts to 620 nm. We verify that
the band shift is due to Mn ions assembling in the lattice rather
than the crystal field effect which contributes to their emission
band shift. The above results indicate that the Mn ions maintain six-fold
coordination and octahedral symmetry after pyridine implantation to
form distorted similar perovskite structures (the CIF data did not
match our experimental result. Therefore, we modified the crystal
image which is consistent with the experimental results). Such perovskite-like
structures use small molecules to confine the MXn cluster as an exciton unit and then increase the lifetime
of excitons in it; regardless of whether Frenkel excitons or Wannier
excitons exist in the unit, their radiation emission were finally
enhanced. This consequence demonstrates that the transition-metal
ion aggregates can tune the emission band of themselves significantly
by the organic molecule-confined environment. This new technique to
modify the transition-metal compounds is important for the design
of new luminescent and magnetic materials. Such crystals may find
novel applications in the optoelectronic devices someday in the future,
like lead perovskites.

4 Experiment Section
4.1 Materials
MnCl2·4H2O (manganese(II)
chloride-4-hydrate, AR 99.0%, Aladdin), pyridine
(analytical grade, Xilong Chemical Co., Ltd., China), hydrochloric
acid (HCl, 36–38 wt % in water, Beijing Chemical Works), and
ethanol (analytical grade, Beijing Tongguang Fine Chemical Co., Ltd.,
China) were purchased and used in this experiment when it is received
and without any purification.

4.2 Synthesis
C10H12N2MnCl4 and C5H6NMnCl3·H2O Crystals
The crystal of C10H12N2MnCl4 was synthesized in the
vial by slowly evaporating the mixed solution of pyridine (1 mmol)
and manganese(II) chloride-4-hydrate (1 mmol); the pyridine and MnCl2 were dissolved in 2 mL ethanol with extra HCl for the solubilization
agent. The vial was put in the heating stage for 40 °C in the
atmosphere environment. A week later, after filtering the mixed reaction
solution, we obtained the crystal. The crystal was preserved in n-hexane, and the largest single crystal has been observed,
it can be about 1.3 cm × 1 mm (shown in Figure 8). Synthesis of the C5H6NMnCl3·H2O crystal was the same as the
method mentioned above, but it needs some alterations in the mole
ratio of pyridine and MnCl2; the mole ratio of pyridine
and MnCl2 was changed to 1:4 (0.25 mmol:1 mmol). The C5H6NMnCl3·H2O crystal
has crystal water instead of chloridion in the crystal lattice, and
the largest single crystal was obtained about 1.2 cm × 3 mm (shown
in Figure 8).
