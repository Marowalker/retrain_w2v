The present work envisaged an adherent
luliconazole-loaded bilayer
nail lacquer (BNL) with significant transungual activity. The locally
applied sustained-release BNL formulation was designed for an improved
retention, payload, and final dermatokinetic disposition. A primary
step in the fabrication of a BNL included overcoming of physical barriers
like α-keratin (also α-keratin), a protein present in
human nails, and then allowing the drug molecule to permeate at the
site of action. Although luliconazole is an established antifungal
agent, has limited clinical exploitation for its use in treating onychomycosis.
An in silico study elucidating its interaction with lanosterol-14-α
demethylase, an enzyme which is the key region of drug action mechanism,
was highly supportive of its imminent clinical potential. Optimization
of prepared BNL formulations via response surface modeling (Box–Behnken
Design-Expert 10.0.6) logically ascertained the effect of selected
independent variables and showcased its effect via dependent responses.
Surface morphology of the prepared BNL films was well corroborated
for the presence of two distinct polymeric layers through scanning
electron microscopy imaging. Nail permeation studies revealed a cumulative
drug release of 71.25 ± 0.11% through bovine hooves up to 24
h. Luliconazole while exposing antifungal activity against clinical
isolates of Trichophyton rubrum in
agar cup-plate method disclosed a 38 mm diameter zone of inhibition.
Further, the optimized BNL exhibited a bioadhesive force of 1.9 ±
0.11 N, which assured its retention on the nail surface for prolonged
duration of time. In Conclusion, it is deduced that the conventional
treatment modalities for onychomycosis require circumvention of certain
pharmacotechnical caveats. Therefore, in the present study, a multipronged
BNL system was proposed, which negates the need of frequent drug application,
improvises cosmetic appearance, yields fruitful therapeutic outcomes,
and has a clinical supremacy over the available therapeutics.

==== Body
Introduction
Onychomycosis is a locoregional fungal
infection of human toes
and finger nails resulting in highly mutilated nails, which often
appear severely disfigured and brittle. The disease is degenerative
in nature and warrants medical intervention possibly also salvaging
the mutilated nail surface by providing a suitable aesthetic appeal.
This is highly relevant as diseased, ill appearing nails lead to discomfort
and poor quality of life.1 Onychomycosis
is prominently caused by Trichophyton rubrum (dermatophyte), which is responsible for causing 60% of such infections.
Nondermatophytes species such as Candida spp., Aspergillus spp., and Fusarium spp. are
also considered as a causative agent for the aforementioned infection.2

Owing to its adversity, onychomycosis often
requires both systemic
as well as frequent topical application for prolonged duration. To
circumvent such challenges, researchers have reported transungual
route, i.e., drug administration through the nail route as a promising
option for the delivery and maintenance of an active medicament on
and across the nail. This targeted drug delivery is achieved with
simple formulation, improved bioadhesion, and locoregional action.
It also has attributes of voluntary removal, reduced drug interactions,
low systemic adverse effects, and avoidance of first-pass metabolism.3−7

However, low or insufficient permeation/penetration of the
drug
on and across highly keratinized nail barrier, composed of α-keratin
having strong disulfide linkages, serves as a major barrier in the
delivery of a therapeutically active formulation via transungual route.8 Recent studies have highlighted the growing concern
of a drug inhibition/resistance development by a fungal cell enzyme,
lanosterol-14-α-demethylase, which further adds onto the aforesaid
challenges.9

To countervail the aforementioned
impediments, the present research
study proposes fabrication of a locally active, aesthetic, antifungal-based,
transungual bilayer nail lacquer (BNL), which is basically an amalgamation
of two nail lacquer layers, i.e., drug-loaded hydrophilic nail lacquer
(primary layer) and drug-free hydrophobic nail lacquer (secondary
layer).10 The purported BNL system is a
novel approach wherein the primary layer efficiently covers the nail
plate aiding substantial permeation of a drug, whereas secondary layer
supports hydrophobicity and BNL integrity. Also, primary layer ensures
longer stay on the nail enamel due to its uneven surface supported
by polymeric mucoadhesion. The attached BNL acts as a drug reservoir,
which is essentially formed after all of the volatile solvent (methanol)
have evaporated.3 Owing to its topical
application, the BNL system considerably reduces systemic side effects
and adverse drug interactions generally observed in oral preparations,
thus improving therapeutic efficacy.9,10

The
major active constituents of a prepared BNL is an antifungal
drug (luliconazole), film-forming polymers (hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose
(HPMC) and cellulose acetate phthalate, CAP), and a permeation enhancer
(thioglycolic acid, TGA).

Luliconazole, a newer class of imidazole
antifungal agent, is reported
to have a broad spectrum of antifungal activity against various species
of fungi, majorly dermatophytes. It has got a limited molecular reporting,
and therefore the scope of understanding its mechanism is still pending.11−14 Henceforth, the current study emphasized upon carrying out an in
silico molecular docking study to check the suitability of luliconazole
and to get better comprehension of the α-keratin (protein present
in human nails)15,16 and lanosterol-14-α demethylase
(an enzyme present in fungal cell walls)17 inhibitory potency at molecular level and also to shed light on
the interactions in the active sites of α-keratin and lanosterol-14-α
demethylase. The resultant protein interaction and enzyme inhibition
by luliconazole and its comparison with the standard of care, ciclopirox,
revealed superimposable three-dimensional (3D) images, which envisaged
it to be a drug of choice. The combinatorial effect of a mucoadhesive
BNL along with the certitude of a drug delivery followed by its interaction
at the drug-target site ensures its suitability for treatment of onychomycosis.

Additionally, thioglycolic acid has been added in primary layer
of a BNL with a sole purpose of enhancing drug penetration on and
across highly keratinized nail barrier by cleaving the α-keratin
disulfide linkages, making surface of human nail more porous due to
the formation of new pores for better drug permeation and retention.18−20

The incorporation of film-forming polymers was done to provide
a bioadhesive and pliable lacquer film over the surface of a highly
dysmorphic nail.21

Further, the histopathological
assessment of a BNL-treated Wistar
rat skin has revealed a low skin irritation profile as it shows an
excellent local tolerability with very minor application-site skin
irritations or reactions.11

Results and Discussion
In Silico
Therapeutic success of any delivery system
heavily relies on the suitable drug choice and its optimal binding
at the drug action site.3 Molecular docking
has emerged as a dependable tool for in silico drug selection,22 which was suitably employed to shortlist luliconazole
as a drug of choice for the current study. It further revealed that
luliconazole binds well with the α keratin of the nail and also
engages at molecular level with lanosterol-14-α demethylase.17

Luliconazole−α-Keratin Interaction
Docking
studies were performed using Glide module of the Schrodinger 9.6 software
on the α-keratin receptor (PDB ID: 4XIF). Docking results reveal that the compound
luliconazole bound tightly in the active site of α-keratin,
as it was well occupied in the receptor cavity and makes hydrogen
bond with Thr 922 and His 920 as presented in Figure 1a,c. The redocking of reference ligand (ciclopirox)
into active site of α-keratin reveals that it occupies the same
binding pocket as presented in Figure 1b,d with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.38
A, which further validates the present docking protocol. Further docking
analysis of compound luliconazole with co-crystallized ligand (ciclopirox)
by superimposition gives the same interaction pattern of binding with
catalytic domain of α-keratin, as represented in Figure 1e. The docking scores of standard
ciclopirox and luliconazole were compared and found to be same.

Luliconazole–Lanosterol-14-α
Demethylase Interaction
Docking studies were performed using
the Glide module of the Schrodinger
9.6 software on the lanosterol-14-α demethylase receptor (PDB
ID: 5HS1). Docking
results reveal that the compound luliconazole bound tightly in the
active site of lanosterol-14-α demethylase as it was well occupied
in the receptor cavity thereby forming hydrogen bond with Cys 470
and π–π stacking with Tyr 126, as presented in Figure 2a,c. The redocking
of reference ligand (ciclopirox) into the active site of lanosterol-14-α
demethylase enzyme reveals that it occupies the same binding pocket
as presented in Figure 2b,d, with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.42 A, which further
validates the present docking protocol. Further docking analysis of
compound luliconazole with co-crystallized ligand (ciclopirox) by
superimposition gives the same interaction pattern of binding with
catalytic domain of lanosterol-14-α demethylase enzyme as represented
in Figure 2e. The docking
score of standard ciclopirox and luliconazole were compared and found
to be the same.

standard drug ciclopirox against lanosterol-14-α demethylase

The resultant protein interaction and enzyme
inhibition by luliconazole
and its comparison with the standard of care, ciclopirox, revealed
superimposable 3D images, which reiterated it to be an effective drug
choice. The combinatorial effect of a mucoadhesive BNL and the certainty
of drug delivery across the nail with adequate binding at the active
drug action site ensures its suitability for the treatment of difficult-to-treat
disease onychomycosis.11

Formulation
Development
Optimization
The ultimate success
of any formulation
design both in vitro and in vivo heavily relies on its optimization,
which assures its optimum or the best possible performance. Therefore,
to successfully fabricate a bilayer nail lacquer (BNL), parameters
such as drying time and nonvolatile content were taken into consideration
as they are cited as crucial parameters in formulation, design, and
optimization of a nail lacquer, listed by Bureau of Indian Standards
(BIS), IS 9245:1994. Henceforth, the sequential optimization was focused
at matching these formulation requirements using Design of Expert
(DoE) software, a Quality by Design (QbD) tool, which uses certain
predecided independent variables, and the proposed dependent variables
often lead to successful designing of optimized formulation. In the
current study, response surface modeling via Box–Behnken design
(BBD) logically ascertains the effect of selected independent variables
and showcases its formulation design outcomes via dependent responses
(drying time and nonvolatile content).23

Drying Time
The prepared BNL is proposed to be a fast-drying
formulation, which will dictate an often-acceptable drug release while
remaining adhered to the nail surface;24 therefore, drying time, which was indicated as a primary dependent
response, was evidently affected by the concentration of a thioglycolic
acid (independent variable) as it is liquid and nonvolatile. Thus,
with increase in thioglycolic acid concentration, drying time increases
since more of the nonvolatile component leads to higher dying time,
as presented in Figure 1a. The concentrations of hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) and
poly(ethylene glycol)-400 (PEG 400) (independent variable) have a
low or negligible effect on drying time (Figure 3a).

Figure 3 BBD quadratic model graphs showcasing the effect
of independent
variables (HPMC, PEG, and thioglycolic acid) on (a) drying time and
(b) nonvolatile content.

Nonvolatile content represents the amount of a nonvolatile
matrix
left after the evaporation of volatile organic solvents. These components
are generally responsible for the formation of a film over the surface
of a nail plate, thus providing an aesthetical covering over a mutilated
nail surface with enhanced drug delivery and cosmetic quotient.25 Therefore, the optimum balance of polymer, i.e.,
film former and nonvolatile solvents, shall be a key to formulation
design, as higher the concentration of polymer (film former) or nonvolatile
solvents used, higher will be the nonvolatile content or vice versa,
which is evident from a significant rise in nonvolatile content (dependent
response 2) after increasing the HPMC concentration (independent variable),26 as highlighted in Figure 3b. Thioglycolic acid being a highly nonvolatile
compound from the liquid surface increases the nonvolatile content
with increase in its concentration. Poly(ethylene glycol)-400 (independent
variable) have however shown a minor effect on nonvolatile content
(Figure 3b) and eventual
film formation.

QbD Optimization of BNL
Further,
the obtained BBD graphs
suggested response surface quadratic models as shown in Figure 3a,c for both the dependent
responses, i.e., drying time and nonvolatile content, as evident from
the adjusted and predicted R2 values of
0.9245 and 0.8219, respectively. An analysis of variance revealed
that the predecided independent factors have positively influenced
and favored the dependent responses presenting significant probability
values (p value) of less than 0.0001 and 0.0002 and
nonsignificant “lack of fit” values of 0.73 and 0.7129
for dependent responses drying time and nonvolatile content, respectively,
both of which successfully reflect a highly acceptable quadratic model.

The following equation in terms of code factors can be used to
make predictions about the response for given levels of each factor:Equation obtained via BBD for drying
time in terms of
coded factor = +164.00 + 11.25 × A + 83.75 × B + 27.50 × C + 2.50 × AB – 5.00 × AC + 5.00 × BC – 0.75 × A2 +
24.25 × B2 – 3.25 × C2

Equation obtained
via BBD for nonvolatile content in
terms of coded factor = +4.71 + 0.11 × A + 1.54
× B + 0.34 × C –
0.095 × AB – 0.075 × AC + 0.35 × BC – 0.31 × A2 + 0.10 × B2 –
0.80 × C2



Accordingly, the BBD has yielded 17 experimental runs predicting
the limits of drying time and nonvolatile content. Formulation coded
F17 having concentrations of HPMC, PEG-400, and thioglycolic acid
as 5, 2.5, and 1 (% w/v), respectively, offers the lowest value for
both drying time, i.e., 80 ± 0.10 s, and nonvolatile content,
i.e., 2.3 ± 0.10%, and therefore, it has been chosen as an optimized
formulation, as highlighted in Table 1.

Further, secondary nail lacquer
formulations have been visually
optimized based on the degree of pliability of various prepared films,
as presented in Table 2. Visual observation has revealed formulation coded as F4, consisting
of 4% (w/v) of cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP) and 2% (w/v) of poloxamer
F-127 as an optimized formulation, as represented in Figure 4.

Evaluation
Determination
of Drying Time
Drying time has emerged
as a major process parameter for nail lacquer evaluation. It significantly
affects nail lacquer application and performance properties as low
and high drying times result in gloomy (not clear) and rigid nail
lacquer films, respectively. Henceforth, for the formation of a pliable
and nonsticky lacquer film, a moderate drying time is required,24 and all of the BNL formulations prepared using
BBD fell in an acceptable range of drying time, i.e., 60–360
s, which is in concordance with the previously mentioned BSI limits.
Formulation coded as F5 exhibited the highest drying time value of
300 ± 0.23 s, whereas formulation coded as F17 took the minimum
time of 80 ± 0.10 s to dry. The drying times for different formulations
are presented in Table 1.

Nonvolatile Content Determination
The amount of a nonvolatile
matrix left after the evaporation of a volatile organic solvents is
usually responsible for the formation of a film over the surface of
a nail plate, thus ensuring complete coverage of a mutilated nail
surface.25,26 BNL formulations prepared via BBD show an
acceptable range of nonvolatile content, i.e., 2.3–6.42%, which
is in agreement with the previously mentioned BSI limits. Among the
various prepared formulations, F5 exhibited the highest value of nonvolatile
content, i.e., 6.42 ± 0.42%, whereas formulation F17 consisted
of a least amount of nonvolatile content, i.e., 2.3 ± 0.10%, Table 1 displays the nonvolatile
content for different formulations.

Characterization
Determination
of the Physical Properties
X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
XRD profiling
provides a commentary
upon the magnitude and outline of trivial crystalline areas and alignment
of single crystal as well.

XRD analysis of BNL formulation showed
a smaller crystalline area compared to pure drug, which has elicited
a larger crystalline area, as presented in Figure 5a.

Figure 5 (a) X-ray diffractograms of an optimized BNL
formulation and a
pure drug. (b) Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image showcasing

SEM
Surface morphology
of the prepared BNL films was
well corroborated for the presence of two distinct polymeric layers
through SEM imaging with smooth surface morphology, confirming a bilayer
structure10 as represented in Figure 5b.

Histological
Assessment
The histological assessment
of rat skin has indicated only slight application-site reactions or
irritations in the formulation-treated group, where due to bursting
of surface capillaries, some disruptions in rat skin layer was observed,
as highlighted in Figure 5c. On the contrary, in the control-treated group, no such
irritation was observed, as the surface capillaries of rat skin are
intact without any disruptions (Figure 5c).33

Luliconazole
offers a wide window of skin safety and tolerability;13 henceforth, the disruptions of a formulation-treated group
were not significant enough compared to the control-treated group,
as evident in Figure 5c.

Characterization of BNL
Skin Irritation
Luliconazole has been widely exploited
for topical application and has shown a high local tolerability and
a skin-friendly profile,11 which is also
evident from the skin irritation studies that showcase BNL formulation
as nonirritant to skin with only trivial signs of erythema and edema
(<2).32 Further, evidences of any undesirable
skin changes such as change in color and morphology were also not
observed in skin irritation profile of a BNL formulation, as presented
in Table 3.

2 = well defined, 3 = moderate, and 4 = scar formation.

b Edema scale: 0 = none, 1 = slight,

In Vitro Release
In vitro release data significantly
showcase a cumulative drug release of 47.5 ± 0.11 and 69.07 ±
0.14% for single layer (primary) and BNL, respectively, across a dialysis
membrane for a period of 24 h. To further explicate the in vitro release
mechanism, various release models were employed and the data were
best fitted in the zeroth-order model (R2 = 0.9748), as presented in Figure 6a, suggesting drug release to be diffusion-controlled.27

Figure 6 (a) In vitro release profile of optimized single-layer
(SL) and
bilayer (BL) nail lacquer formulations. (b) Nail permeation profile
of optimized single-layer (SL) and bilayer (BL) nail lacquer formulations.
(c) Bioadhesive force of a single-layer nail lacquer and BNL at different
contact times measured via texture analyzer using bovine hooves as
a substrate.

Nail Permeation
Nail permeation data of a single layer
(primary) reveal a cumulative drug release of 52.5 ± 0.12%, and
for BNL, it was found to be 71.25 ± 0.11% through bovine hooves
up to 24 h. A high cumulative drug release of 71.25 ± 0.11% (nail
permeation studies) justifies the use of thioglycolic acid as permeation
enhancer, since it is responsible for breaking disulfide linkages
present in bovine hooves leading to enhanced porosity and the resultant
drug permeation.28 In vitro release kinetic
modeling suggested it as a best fit for zeroth-order model (R2 = 0.9962), as presented in Figure 6b, thus indicating a diffusion-controlled
drug release.27

Bioadhesion
One
of the salient features of the current
formulation design was to ascertain adequate bioadhesion which is
solely responsible for a significant retention of a supersaturated
lacquer film onto the nail for a prolonged time duration.29−31 Single layer (primary) revealed bioadhesive forces of 0.2 ±
0.11, 0.5 ± 0.11, and 0.7 ± 0.13 N at times 30, 60, and
90 s respectively, whereas BNL unveils bioadhesive forces of 0.9 ±
0.11, 1.7 ± 0.12, and 1.9 ± 0.11 N at 30, 60, and 90 s,
respectively. As evident from the obtained data, the degree of bioadhesive
force increases with an increase in the contact time intervals,31 as presented in Figure 6c; a bioadhesive force of 1.9 ± 0.11
N (optimized formulation) provided substantial bioadhesion and ensured
sufficient drug availability for delivery across the nail.

Evaluation of BNL
Microbiological Evaluation—In Vitro
Antifungal Activity
Microbiological evaluation of the formulation
supported the choice
of a luliconazole,17 which developed an
active zone of inhibition diameter (38 mm) against T. rubrum, which is considered as a major causative
fungal agent for onychomycosis2,11,33 (Table 4).

Stability Studies
The obtained ranges of drying time
and nonvolatile content for an optimized nail lacquer formulation,
i.e., (F17), were found to be 110 ± 0.3 and 8 ± 0.1 s and
4.96 ± 0.5 and 1.3 ± 0.1%, respectively, for a storage period
of 1 month at a temperature of 4–25 °C, which are in concordance
with the previously mentioned BIS limits.

Conclusions
The stability of the BNL system for a period of 1 month and its
highly relevant pharmacotechnical attributes like low drying time,
appreciable nonvolatile content, and minimal skin irritation with
suitable aesthetic coverage indicates its potential to address the
caveats associated with the treatment of a challenging disease like
onychomycosis and offers a novel drug-delivery platform for its successful
treatment.

Experimental Section
Materials
Luliconazole was procured
as gift sample
from Cadila Pharmaceuticals Limited (Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India); hydroxypropyl
methyl cellulose (HPMC) and cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP) were
procured from Jubilant Life Sciences Limited. All other chemicals
and reagents were of analytical grade obtained from Merck, India.

Methods
In Silico
Molecular docking simulations of luliconazole
at the α-keratin and lanosterol-14-α demethylase receptor
catalytic ligand binding site, PDB ID: 4XIF and PDB ID: 5HS1, respectively, were carried out to study
the binding mode of luliconazole with α-keratin and lanosterol-14-α
demethylase at the molecular level. The docking of drug compounds
was performed using Maestro, version 9.6, implemented from Schrodinger
software suite. The ligand was sketched in 3D format using build panel
and were prepared for docking using LigPrep application. The protein
for docking study was taken from Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 4XIF; PDB ID: 5HS1) and prepared by
removing solvent, adding hydrogen, and further minimization in the
presence of bound ligand; H4V and VOR, respectively, using protein
preparation wizard. Grids for molecular docking were generated with
bound co-crystallized ligand. For the validation of docking parameters,
the standard ligand (ciclopirox) was redocked at the catalytic site
of protein, and the RMSDs between co-crystal and redocked pose was
found to be 0.38 and 0.42 A, respectively. Luliconazole was docked
using Glide extraprecision mode, with up to three poses saved per
molecule.

Fabrication of a BNL System
The
two prominent layers
of a BNL system (primary and secondary) were prepared via simple mixing.

For primary layer, API/luliconazole (1% w/v) was dissolved in 5
mL of methanol and placed on a magnetic stirrer at 150 rpm and room
temperature. To the resulting drug–solution mixture, HPMC,
poly(ethylene glycol)-400 (PEG-400), glycerol, and thioglycolic acid
were sequentially added with continuous stirring.3 A total of 17 formulations were prepared as presented in Table 1 and optimized further.

For the secondary layer, Poloxamer F-127 and cellulose acetate
phthalate (CAP) were dissolved in acetone on a vortex mixer (50 rpm)
at room temperature. A total of four formulations were prepared as
presented in Table 2 and optimized further.

Optimization
The Box–Behnken
design (BBD), Design-Expert
10.0.6, was employed for the optimization of prepared nail lacquer
(primary) formulations. For exploring the experimental design selection
of independent variables such as concentrations of HPMC, thioglycolic acid and PEG-400 were done
on the basis of their ability to affect a formulation and also to
analyze their effects on dependent variables such as drying time and
nonvolatile content, which were selected as crucial parameters in
determining formulation attributes.

The basic optimization criterion
for secondary nail lacquer formulations was the degree of pliability
of various prepared films.

Evaluation
The evaluation parameters
listed by Bureau
of Indian Standards (BIS), IS 9245:1994, were exploited for the evaluation
of the prepared nail lacquers.

Determination of Drying
Time
In the present study,
the uniformly thin nail lacquer layer (primary) was applied onto a
clean aluminum plate using a lacquer brush and observed further (For
BNL, the primary layer was initially applied and dried, followed by
an application of a secondary layer.) It was allowed to dry for 60
s, this being the minimum time needed for drying of a lacquer, and
subsequently after an interval of 10 s, the applied lacquer film was
slightly touched using the tip of a clean glass rod. This exercise
was repeated until there was no resultant transfer of any matter on
the tip of a glass rod or up to 360 s (maximum drying time range for
a nail lacquer). The lacquer formulations falling in the range of
60–360 s were considered to have passed the test for drying
time.

Nonvolatile Content Determination
A small amount of
sample (1.0 ± 0.2 g) of each layer was weighed accurately in
a tin plate and further subjected to drying in a hot-air oven at a
temperature of 105 ± 2 °C for 1 h. The tin plate was then
removed, cooled, and reweighed by using the following formula

Equation for the determination of a nonvolatile content  where

M = mass in g of the
material (nail lacquer) taken

M1 = mass in g of the dry and empty
tin plate

M2 = mass in g of the
tin plate and
dried material (nail lacquer)

According to BIS, the acceptable
range of nonvolatile content for
nail lacquers is up to 20%.

Characterization
Determination
of the Physical Properties
Characterization
of an optimized BNL formulation was done by exploiting the following
parameters.

X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
PANalytical
X’Pert3 powder was employed for recording the diffractograms
of pure
drug and optimized BNL formulation (sample amount, 2 mg). The obtained
diffractograms were further traced via an X-ray diffractometer (Ultima
IV) exploiting monochromatic Ni-filtered Cu K radiation, with a 40
kV voltage and 30 mA current radiations scattered in the crystalline
regions of the sample, which were measured with a vertical goniometer.
XRD patterns of the aforesaid samples were obtained by using a step
width of 0.04° with a detector resolution in 2θ (diffraction
angle) between 10 and 90° at ambient temperature.

Scanning Electron
Microscopy (SEM)
The optimized BNL
samples were mounted on a metal stub with gold coated under vacuum
and then examined on Zeiss EVO40, Carl Zeiss NTS (North America).

Skin Irritation Studies
The protocol approved by the
Institutional Animal Ethics Committee was followed for the aforesaid
studies. An optimized BNL formulation (F17) was applied on the dorsal
side (2 cm2) of properly shaved skin of Wistar strain rats
(180–200 g) and was subsequently compared to a control group
(no formulation applied) of Wistar strain rats. Further, to scrutinize
any signs of erythema and edema, the applied formulation was removed
after 24 h and evaluated on an observation scale of 0–4.33

Histological Assessment
After a
24 h observation period
of skin irritation studies, the rats were sacrificed and the excised
skin samples were immediately immersed in 10% (v/v) formalin solution
buffered with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Subsequently, the
samples were dehydrated in graded concentrations of ethanol and then
immersed in xylene, to prepare paraffin blocks. Skin sections of thickness
5 μm were cut using a microtome and stained with hematoxylin
and eosin. The samples were then observed for gross histopathology
under a microscope (Motic, Japan ix71, Olympus Corporation, Japan)
at 10× magnifications.32

In Vitro Release
Studies
A formulation sample of about
100 μL (primary layer) was applied over a dialysis membrane
(1 mm thickness), which was then adjusted over a glass vial in such
a manner that membrane only touches the surface of the release media.
Phosphate-buffered saline (5 mL) was filled in a 5 mL glass or receptor
vial, which was placed over a magnetic stirrer at 37 °C with
a stirring speed of 600 rpm. Appropriate amounts of samples (3 mL)
were collected over a predetermined time interval and replaced with
an equal amount of fresh dissolution medium. Luliconazole in the sample
solution was analyzed by the UV method at λmax =
296 nm. The samples of BNL were subjected to similar protocols.

Nail Permeation Studies
Owing to their keratinized
structure similar to human nails, bovine hooves were taken as a sample
model to determine permeation of a nail lacquer via nails.,834

The lower part of the bovine hooves was
placed in a microtome for cutting a 1 mm thick section, which could
be further mounted in between the two compartments (donor and receptor)
of the Franz diffusion cell with an effective surface area and receptor
cell volume of 1.23 cm2 and 10 mL, respectively. A formulation
sample of about 100 μL (primary layer) was applied carefully
over a bovine hoof membrane placed in donor compartment of the Franz
diffusion cell. The receptor compartment was filled with solvent system
(phosphate-buffered saline/methanol, 7:3), and the whole assembly
was maintained at 37 °C with a constant stirring speed of 100
rpm for 24 h. The samples (2 mL) were collected through a sampling
port over a predetermined time interval upholding sink condition and
were analyzed by the UV method at λmax = 296 nm.
A graph was constructed between % cumulative drug permeated and time.3,8 The sample of BNL was subjected to a similar protocol.

Bioadhesion
Studies
The degree of bioadhesion for nail
lacquer samples was estimated using bovine hooves model via a texture
analyzer fitted with a 5 kg load cell (TA. XT2i, Technologies Corp.,
Scarsdale, NY/STable Micro Systems, Godalming, Surrey, U.K.).

The bovine hooves samples were cut into 6 mm diameter plates, which
were further placed onto the mucoadhesion rig and a formulation sample
of about 100 μL (primary layer) was applied over it. As a standard
procedure, the test probe was adjusted to a height of 20 mm and then
lowered at a speed of 10 mm/s with a force of 3 N. As the probe slightly
touched the surface of the lacquer film, a trigger force of 0.3 N
was applied for 30, 60, or 90 s. After elapsing of the predetermined
time, the probe was withdrawn from the surface of the sample at a
preset speed of 0.5 mm/s. The force that was needed to withdraw the
probe from the lacquer film was recorded as bioadhesive force.8 The sample of BNL was subjected to a similar
protocol.

Microbiological Evaluation—In Vitro
Antifungal Activity
To examine the antifungal activity of
luliconazole against C. albicans and T. rubrum, the agar cup-plate method was exploited.
A nutrient agar medium
(30 mL) was prepared and sterilized via autoclaving at 120 ±
1.5 °C and 15 pounds pressure for 15 min and inoculated with C. albicans and T. rubrum fungal strains (2 mL of inoculum to 100 mL of nutrient agar media).
The concentration of inoculum was adjusted with 0.5 McFarlands standard
(0.5 McFarlands = 1.5 × 108 CFU/mL). The inoculated
nutrient agar medium was allowed to solidify in two sterilized Petri
plates, and in each Petri plate, wells were prepared, having an effective
diameter of 5 mm via sterile borer.8 A
stock solution of 0.25 μg/mL of luliconazole was prepared in
methanol. The stock solution (0.1 mL) was pipetted onto the fungal
wells (T. rubrum and C. albicans).34 For blank, methanol solution
of same concentration as stock was taken. The prepared Petri plates
were incubated at 28 °C and zone diameters were measured after
24, 48, and 120 h to estimate the marked zone of inhibition using
(Antibiotic Zone Reader, HICON, New Delhi). The sample of BNL was
subjected to a similar protocol.

Stability Studies
The optimized formulation was stored
at a temperature of 4 ± 25 °C for 1 month and was subsequently
evaluated for its drying time and nonvolatile content.
