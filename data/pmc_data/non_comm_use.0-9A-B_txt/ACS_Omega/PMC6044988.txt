Trehalose is a disaccharide
that is biosynthesized by many different
organisms subjected to extreme conditions, such as dehydration, heat,
oxidative stress, and freezing. This disaccharide allows organisms
to better survive these environmental stresses; however, the mechanisms
by which trehalose exerts its protective effects are not well understood.
Methods to accurately measure trehalose from different organisms will
help us gain better understanding of these protective mechanisms.
In this study, three experimental approaches for the quantification
of trehalose from biological samples were compared: an enzymatic trehalose
assay (Trehalose Assay Kit; Megazyme International), a high-performance
liquid chromatography coupled with refractive index detection-based
assay, and a liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry
(LC–MS/MS)-based assay. Limits of detection and quantification
for each assay were compared, as were the dynamic ranges for all three
assays. The percent recoveries for known amounts of trehalose spiked
into bacterial and mammalian cellular lysates were also determined
for each of the assays. Finally, endogenous trehalose produced by Escherichia coli cells was detected and quantified
using these assays. Results from this study indicate that an LC–MS/MS-based
assay is the most direct and sensitive method for the quantification
of low concentrations of trehalose from biological samples; however,
the enzymatic assay is suitable for the rapid quantification of higher
concentrations of trehalose when an LC–MS/MS is unavailable.

Introduction
The disaccharide trehalose,
or α-d-glucose(1→1)α-d-glucose
(Figure 1a), acts as
a remarkable cellular protectant for many different organisms,
including bacteria, fungi, plants, insects, and eukaryotic microorganisms.1−7 When subjected to extreme conditions, such as cold, heat, desiccation,
or reactive oxygen species, these organisms biosynthesize high concentrations
of both intra- and extracellular trehalose, which allows them to better
survive these environmental stresses.1−9 For example, the desiccation-tolerant plant, Selaginella
lepidophylla, accumulates intracellular trehalose
at levels up to 12% of its dry weight during periods of drought.10 High concentrations of trehalose are also found
in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (a strain
of yeast) that are subjected to heating; yeast mutants that are defective
in the genes that encode for trehalose biosynthesis are unable to
produce trehalose upon heat shock and are much less resistant to heating
than wild-type yeast.4,11 Mammals do not naturally produce
trehalose; however, delivery of trehalose into mammalian cells improves
survival rates after freezing, drying, or heat shock.12−16 Furthermore, the administration of exogenous trehalose has been
shown to provide neuroprotective effects in animal models of Huntington’s
disease, Parkinson’s disease, and amytrophic lateral sclerosis.17−20 The ability of trehalose to protect cells from damage, along with
its lack of cellular toxicity, has generated interest in using this
disaccharide as a general cellular protectant.1,3−9,12−16

the 13C12-trehalose precursor ion (m/z = 377) and 13C6-glucose

The exact mechanisms by which trehalose exerts its protective
effects
are not well elucidated; it is hypothesized that this carbohydrate
partially replaces the water inside cells and around cellular components,
including proteins and lipid membranes.3,4 By forming
hydrogen bonds with proteins and lipids, trehalose helps maintain
membrane integrity and enzyme structure. Trehalose is also reported
to form a stable glass (a liquid of high viscosity) at room temperature,
thus leading to a reduction in the rates of damaging biochemical reactions
in a cell.3,4 Further investigation of the role of trehalose
in cellular protection is necessary; therefore, it is crucial to be
able to detect and accurately quantify trehalose from organisms exposed
to various environmental conditions.

Several methods have been
reported for the quantification of trehalose
from biological sources.21−36 One of the most commonly used methods for quantifying trehalose
is an enzymatic assay that uses trehalase, an enzyme that cleaves
trehalose into two glucose monomers (Scheme 1).22−24 The enzyme hexokinase then catalyzes
the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P), and
G-6-P is subsequently oxidized to gluconate-6-phosphate. The oxidation
of G-6-P is catalyzed by the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase,
and during the reaction, NADP+, the oxidized form of nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide phosphate, is reduced to reduced nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), the reduced form of this cofactor.
NADPH absorbs light at a wavelength of 340 nm, which can be quantified
by spectrophotometric means.24 Trehalose
concentrations in biological samples can then be calculated on the
basis of the NADPH absorbance from this series of enzymatic reactions.24 Another reported method for the quantification
of trehalose is high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled
with detection by a pulsed electrochemical detector or a refractive
index (RI) detector (RID).25−31 In this method, trehalose is separated from other biological compounds
via liquid chromatography and quantified by its refractive index (RI)
or electrochemical signal. Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry
(LC–MS) has also been used to quantify trehalose;32−34 recently, a liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry
(LC–MS/MS) assay for the quantification of trehalose has been
developed by our laboratory.34 In this
assay, trehalose is separated via liquid chromatography and quantified
via tandem mass spectrometry using maltose as an internal standard.

Scheme 1 Overview of the Enzymatic Trehalose Assay Used in This Study
In the enzymatic trehalose assay
(Trehalose Assay Kit), trehalose is converted to gluconate-6-phosphate
through a series of enzymatic reactions. This coupled enzyme assay
yields two reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)
for each trehalose input. NADPH absorbs ultraviolet light and thus
allows for the quantification of trehalose by spectrophotometric means.

Although all of the above methods can be used
for quantifying trehalose
from biological sources, the different methods have not been directly
compared. Therefore, the relative advantages and limitations of these
methods and the suitability of each method for a chosen application
have not been established. The purpose of this study is to help trehalose
researchers choose the most suitable method for trehalose quantification.
In this study, three different assays for the quantification of trehalose
were compared: the enzymatic trehalose assay (Trehalose Assay Kit;
Megazyme International), an HPLC coupled to a refractive index detector
(HPLC-RID)-based assay, and an LC–MS/MS-based assay. The instrument
limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) for trehalose for
each assay were compared, as were their dynamic ranges. The accuracy
of each assay was determined by calculating the percent recoveries
for known amounts of trehalose spiked into bacterial and mammalian
cellular lysates. Finally, these assays were used to detect and quantify
endogenous trehalose produced by Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells. Results from this
study indicate that an LC–MS/MS-based assay is the most direct
and sensitive method for the quantification of nanomolar concentrations
of trehalose from biological samples; however, the enzymatic assay
is suitable for the rapid quantification of micromolar concentrations
of trehalose when an LC–MS/MS is unavailable.

Results and Discussion
Trehalose
Assay Detection and Quantification
The quantification
of trehalose from biological samples can be accomplished using a variety
of different assays, such as an enzymatic trehalose assay, an HPLC-RID-based
assay, or an LC–MS/MS-based assay.22−34 To gain better understanding of the advantages and limitations of
these different assays, it is necessary to demonstrate that all of
them can specifically detect trehalose even in the presence of other
disaccharides. The disaccharides trehalose, lactose, maltose, and
sucrose (separately or as a mixture) were subjected to these three
assays; for each assay, disaccharide concentrations were chosen to
ensure a robust signal. For the enzymatic trehalose assay, samples
containing a single disaccharide were subjected to Megazyme’s
Trehalose Assay Kit.24 Only samples containing
trehalose gave a significant absorbance signal above background, demonstrating
that this assay is specific for the disaccharide trehalose (Figure 2a). For the HPLC-RID-based
assay, a solution containing all four disaccharides was injected onto
an Agilent 1100 series HPLC. The sugars were separated using a Waters
high-performance carbohydrate column and then detected using an Agilent
1260 Infinity series RID. As shown in Figure 2b, trehalose is well separated from all three
disaccharides, thus allowing for its reliable quantification in the
presence of other disaccharides using this assay. The LC–MS/MS-based
assay is based on an assay previously reported by our laboratory.34 In the present study, the assay has been modified
to use 13C12-trehalose, an isotopically labeled
analogue of trehalose, in which all of the 12C atoms have
been replaced by 13C atoms, instead of maltose as an internal
standard for trehalose quantification. The use of 13C12-trehalose allows for a shorter analysis time than the use
of maltose; no significant differences in data quality have been observed.
To determine the specificity of this LC–MS/MS-based assay,
the four disaccharides were separated using a Waters high-performance
carbohydrate column and detected using an Agilent 6410B triple quadrupole
mass spectrometer. The mass spectrometer was operated in selected
reaction monitoring (SRM) mode, monitoring for the trehalose transitions
of 360–163 m/z and 360–85 m/z and for the 13C12-trehalose transition of 377–209 m/z, all in positive mode. These transitions were chosen for
each disaccharide using Agilent MassHunter Optimizer software. For
trehalose, the m/z value of 360
corresponds to the [M + NH4+] trehalose precursor
ion (ammonium acetate was used in the LC–MS solvents to aid
in the ionization of the disaccharides), the m/z value of 163 corresponds to the [M+] oxocarbenium
fragment ion, and the m/z value
of 85 corresponds to a fragment ion with a molecular formula of [CO2H2 + K+] (Figure 1b). For 13C12-trehalose,
the m/z value of 377 corresponds
to the [M + Na+] 13C12-trehalose
precursor ion, and the m/z value
of 209 corresponds to the [M + Na+] 13C6-glucose fragment ion (Figure 1c). These LC–MS/MS conditions detect trehalose,
maltose, and sucrose, but do not detect lactose (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Furthermore, trehalose
is well separated from maltose and sucrose (Figure 2c), demonstrating that the presence of other
disaccharides in samples will not interfere with trehalose quantification
when using the LC–MS/MS-based assay.

assay. All disaccharide concentrations were 1 mM, and the sample volume

was achieved using a Waters high-performance carbohydrate column (4.6
× 250 mm2, 4 μm) held at 35 °C. The mobile
phase was composed of 16:84 water/acetonitrile with an isocratic elution
over 40 min using a flow rate of 1.4 mL/min. All disaccharide concentrations
were 20 mM, and the injection volume was 50 μL. (c) SRM chromatogram
showing the separation of trehalose (retention time = 30.3 min) from
three other disaccharides, sucrose (retention time = 18.2 min), maltose
(retention time = 23.8 min), and lactose (not detected by this method)
for the LC–MS/MS-based assay. Separation was achieved using
a Waters high-performance carbohydrate column (4.6 × 250 mm2, 4 μm) held at 35 °C. The mobile phase was composed
of 16:84 2 mM ammonium acetate in water/2 mM ammonium acetate in acetonitrile
with an isocratic elution over 35 min using a flow rate of 1.4 mL/min.
All disaccharide concentrations were 25 μM, and the injection
volume was 40 μL.

Having determined that these three assays are selective for
the
detection of trehalose, calibration curves for this disaccharide were
constructed for each assay. These curves reveal the range of trehalose
concentrations suitable for each assay, as well as the precision of
each assay. For the enzymatic trehalose assay, the calibration curve
of 25–1000 μM trehalose is best fit by a linear curve
(Figure 3a). The responses
for the HPLC-RID-based assay also are fit best by a linear curve (Figure 3b); however, to detect
trehalose, it is necessary to use concentrations that are much higher
(1–100 mM trehalose) than those used for the enzymatic trehalose
assay. In contrast to the enzymatic trehalose and HPLC-RID assays,
the calibration curve of 0.1–100 μM trehalose using 13C12-trehalose as an internal standard for the
LC–MS/MS-based assay is best fit by a single polynomial (Figure 3c). As previously
reported, a single polynomial calibration curve is also the best way
to model the LC–MS/MS responses to trehalose using maltose
as an internal standard; a linear fit would introduce accuracy errors.34 This nonlinear response is most likely due to
saturation; at the low end of the concentration range (1 μM
trehalose and lower), the data are fit well by a linear curve, whereas
higher concentrations of trehalose require a single polynomial curve.
Moreover, there is precedent for single polynomial fits for LC–MS/MS
data.34,37−40 For example, a single polynomial
fit has been used to model the response of an LC–MS/MS instrument
to a platinum anticancer drug in human plasma samples.38 For the LC–MS/MS-based assay used here,
a single polynomial gives the best fit. The calibration curve for
trehalose using this LC–MS/MS-based assay allows for very low
concentrations of trehalose to be quantified, which is a significant
advantage of this assay; as little as 0.1 μM trehalose is within
its range. Moreover, these data demonstrate that all three assays
are precise; the standard deviations (SDs) for the signals for each
assay are low (Tables S1–S3, Supporting Information).

assay,

(a) Trehalose calibration curve for the enzymatic trehalose assay
is best fit by a linear curve. Standards containing varying concentrations
of trehalose (25–1000 μM) were subjected to the enzymatic
trehalose assay (sample volume = 20 μL, Trehalose Assay Kit;
Megazyme International, Ireland), and the absorbances were measured.
Error bars represent the standard deviation (n =
3). (b) Trehalose calibration curve for the HPLC-RID assay is best
fit by a linear curve. Standards containing varying concentrations
of trehalose (1–100 mM) were injected onto the HPLC in triplicate
(mobile phase = 23:77 water/acetonitrile, injection volume = 50 μL),
and the microrefractive index units (μRIU) for trehalose were
measured. Error bars represent the standard deviation (n = 3). (c) Trehalose calibration curve for the LC–MS/MS assay
using 13C12-trehalose as an internal standard
is best fit by a single polynomial. Standards containing varying concentrations
of trehalose (0.1–100 μM) with 5 μM 13C12-trehalose as an internal standard were injected onto
the LC–MS/MS in quadruplicate (mobile phase = 20:80 2 mM ammonium
acetate in water/2 mM ammonium acetate in acetonitrile, injection
volume = 40 μL), and the relative responses for trehalose were
calculated. Error bars represent the standard deviation (n = 4).

Trehalose Assay Sensitivities
Once it was determined
that reproducible calibration curves for trehalose using these three
assays could be generated, the assay sensitivities were established
by determining the instrument limits of detection and quantification
(LOD and LOQ, respectively). The instrument LOD and LOQ are defined
as the smallest amount of trehalose that can be reliably detected
and accurately quantified, respectively, using different assays. As
shown in Table 1, the
LC–MS/MS-based assay for trehalose is the most sensitive assay,
giving an instrument LOD of 22 nM and an instrument LOQ of 28 nM for
trehalose. These values are 2–3 and 4–5 orders of magnitude
lower than those for the enzymatic assay and the HPLC-RID-based assay,
respectively (Table 1). To confirm the validity of the instrument LODs, samples containing
trehalose at the concentration corresponding to the LOD for each assay
were prepared and analyzed. For all of the assays, the signal-to-noise
ratios (S/N) at the instrument LOD are greater than 1.5, demonstrating
that calculated values for the instrument LODs are able to be detected
experimentally (Table 1 and Figure S2, Supporting Information).

Table 1 Instrument Limits of Detection (LOD)
and Quantification (LOQ), Method Detection Limits (MDL) and Quantification
Limits (MQL), and Signal-to-Noise Ratios (S/N) for All Three Assays
assay	LOD	LOQ	MDL	MQL	S/N at LOD	
enzymatic trehalose assay	6.3 μM	21 μM	6.4 μM	21 μM	2.7	
HPLC-RID	0.6 mM	2.2 mM	0.9 mM	2.9 mM	1.8	
LC–MS/MS	22 nM	28 nM	35 nM	74 nM	177	
More conservative measures
of the sensitivity of a method are the
method detection limit (MDL) and method quantification limit (MQL).
The MDL and MQL are defined as the smallest amount of trehalose that
can be reliably detected and quantified, respectively; they differ
from the LOD and LOQ in that they include the error arising from sample
preparation. As shown in Table 1, the LC–MS/MS-based assay gives an instrument MDL
of 35 nM trehalose and an instrument MQL of 74 nM trehalose. These
values are 2–3 and 4–5 orders of magnitude lower than
those for the enzymatic assay and the HPLC-RID-based assay, respectively
(Table 1). Such low
values for the MDL and MQL demonstrate that the LC–MS/MS-based
assay is the most sensitive method for the detection and quantification
of trehalose, even when taking into account the error involved in
sample preparation.

Having establishing the LOD, LOQ, MDL, and
MQL for these assays,
the dynamic ranges for all three assays were determined. For the enzymatic
trehalose assay, the lower limit for quantification is 21 μM
(Table 1). At trehalose
concentrations above 4 mM, the enzymatic trehalose assay does not
respond reliably to further increases in trehalose concentration;
the corrected absorbance values do not change significantly as the
concentration of trehalose increases from 4 to 100 mM (Figure S3, Supporting Information). On the basis
of these data, it can be concluded that the dynamic range for the
enzymatic trehalose assay spans slightly more than 2 orders of magnitude,
from 21 μM to 4 mM trehalose. For the HPLC-RID-based assay,
the lower limit for trehalose quantification is 2.2 mM (Table 1). At trehalose concentrations
above 100 mM, the RI signal flattens out, suggesting that high concentrations
of trehalose saturate the RI detector. The dynamic range for the HPLC-RID-based
assay is slightly broader than that for the enzymatic trehalose assay,
spanning approximately 2 orders of magnitude, from 2.2 to 100 mM trehalose. The dynamic range for
the LC–MS/MS-based assay is the broadest of all three assays;
it spans between 3 and 4 orders of magnitude, from 0.03 to 100 μM
trehalose. At trehalose concentrations above 100 μM, the SRM
peaks are very broad and exhibit two maxima, suggesting that such
high concentrations of trehalose saturate the MS detector. Nevertheless,
all three assays have good dynamic ranges, ranging from 2 to 4 orders
of magnitude, allowing for the quantification of a broad range of
trehalose concentrations in biological samples.

Trehalose Assay
Accuracies
To determine the accuracies
of the three assays for the quantification of trehalose in samples
with known concentrations, solutions containing a variety of trehalose
concentrations across the ranges of the different calibration curves
were prepared and analyzed. Trehalose concentrations in these samples
were calculated from the calibration curve obtained from each different
assay. The percent recoveries for these samples for all three assays
are within 10% of the expected concentrations, ranging from 98 to
110%. All three assays are therefore highly accurate for the calculation
of trehalose concentrations from unknown samples (Table 2).

The accuracies
of these three assays for the quantification of
trehalose in more complex samples with known concentrations of trehalose
were also evaluated. Known amounts of trehalose were spiked into lysates
from either E. coli (strain DH5α)
or Jurkat cells (a human T-cell line), and the trehalose concentrations
in the samples were calculated from the calibration curves obtained
from each trehalose assay. For the LC–MS/MS-based assay, standards
for the calibration curve were prepared in a mixture of 1:1 acetonitrile/cell
lysates, with the lysates matching the lysates being analyzed; this
was done to reduce the matrix effect often observed in MS-based assays.34,41 The matrix effect is a change in the response of the LC–MS/MS
to a specific compound when complicated samples are analyzed; it is
hypothesized to result from molecules originating from the sample
mixture that coelute with the compound of interest, causing either
ionization suppression or enhancement in the mass spectrometer.34,41 For all three assays, the percent recoveries from samples prepared
in E. coli lysates are within 7% of
the expected concentrations, ranging from 93 to 106% (Table 3). For samples prepared in Jurkat
cell lysates, the percent recoveries are also within 7% of the expected
concentrations, ranging from 93 to 100% (Table 4). These high percent recoveries demonstrate
that all three assays are very accurate for the quantification of
trehalose, even when complex matrices, such as cell lysates, are analyzed.
Furthermore, it can be concluded that all three assays can be used
with a variety of biological samples because excellent recoveries
in two different types of cell lysates are observed.

Quantification
of Endogenous Trehalose from E.
coli Cells
Finally, these three assays were
evaluated for the detection and quantification of endogenous trehalose
from bacterial cells that biosynthesize trehalose. For these experiments,
the arabinose-inducible OtsA/OtsB overproducer of the E. coli strain MC4100, which produces intracellular
trehalose when arabinose is added to the medium used to grow the cells,
was used.42 Lysates from these cells were
subjected to the three different trehalose assays. For the LC–MS/MS-based
assay, standards for the calibration curve were prepared using lysates
from the trehalose knockout (ΔotsA) of the E. coli strain MC4100, which are unable to biosynthesize
trehalose and therefore contain no endogenous trehalose to interfere
with quantitative analysis.43 Trehalose
was not detected in the lysates from the OtsA/OtsB overproducer E. coli cells by the enzymatic trehalose assay or
the HPLC-RID-based assay. For the enzymatic trehalose assay, endogenous
glucose in the lysates resulted in very high background absorbance
values, which caused the corrected absorbance values for the lysates
to be outside the dynamic range of the assay. For the HPLC-RID-based
assay, no peak was detected for trehalose in the lysates. In contrast,
a significant peak for trehalose was detected at the expected retention
time for lysates from the OtsA/OtsB overproducer E.
coli cells (Figure S4, Supporting Information) when using the LC–MS/MS-based assay. The
calculated trehalose concentrations from the four different E. coli lysate samples ranged from 5 to 10 μM.
Such a low trehalose concentration in these lysates explains why trehalose
was not detected by either the enzymatic trehalose assay or the HPLC-RID-based
assay; 5–10 μM trehalose is below both the instrument
LOQ and LOD for these two assays. Using the trehalose concentrations
from the cell lysates (as calculated using the LC–MS/MS-based
assay), as well as the total number of E. coli cells lysed (approximately 4 × 1010 cells/sample),
it was determined that the internal trehalose concentration inside
one E. coli cell is 40 ± 10 mM
(n = 4). These data demonstrate that the LC–MS/MS-based
assay is exceptional when compared to the enzymatic trehalose assay
or the HPLC-RID-based assay for the detection and quantification of
low concentrations of trehalose in complex biological samples.

Advantages
and Limitations of the Trehalose Assays
All three assays
evaluated in this study, the enzymatic trehalose
assay, the HPLC-RID-based assay, and the LC–MS/MS-based assay,
can be used to accurately detect and quantify trehalose from a variety
of biological matrices (Tables 3 and 4). Each assay, however, is best
suited to a different range of trehalose concentrations (Figure 3 and Table 1). The LC–MS/MS-based
assay is the most sensitive of the three assays, with an LOD of 22
nM and an LOQ of 28 nM for trehalose, and is optimal for quantifying
nanomolar concentrations of trehalose. In contrast, the HPLC-RID-based
assay has an LOD of 0.6 mM and an LOQ of 2.2 mM for trehalose; this
assay is most suitable for biological samples containing millimolar
concentrations of trehalose. With an LOD of 6.3 μM and an LOQ
of 21 μM trehalose, the enzymatic trehalose assay is best used
for trehalose concentrations in the micromolar range. The high sensitivity
of the LC–MS/MS-based assay for trehalose is a significant
advantage in that it allows for the detection and quantification of
concentrations of trehalose in biological samples that are prohibitively
low for the other two assays; specifically, it was the only assay
able to detect and quantify endogenous trehalose from the OtsA/OtsB
overproducer E. coli lysates evaluated
in this study.

Beyond sensitivity, an additional benefit of
the LC–MS/MS-based assay is that it conclusively identifies
trehalose as the analyte being detected and quantified; MS signals
are only observed for the trehalose precursor ion and its fragment
ions. In contrast, the enzymatic trehalose assay does not quantify
trehalose directly; the absorbance values obtained from this assay
arise from NADPH, a product in the series of enzymatic reactions that
converts trehalose to gluconate-6-phosphate (Scheme 1).24 Complex biological
samples may contain molecules that interfere with this absorption;
as observed in the present study, high levels of endogenous glucose
in the OtsA/OtsB overproducer E. coli lysates resulted in high background absorbance values, causing a
reduction in the actual signal for the enzymatic trehalose assay.
The HPLC-RID-based assay also does not conclusively identify trehalose
on the basis of its RI signal; trehalose can coelute with other biological
compounds in the sample, thus causing an overestimation of trehalose
concentration when using this assay. Therefore, the LC–MS/MS
assay is advantageous for measuring trehalose concentrations in complex
biological samples.

The LC–MS/MS-based assay could also
be used to quantify
radiolabeled trehalose or other trehalose analogues. Trehalose is
an important nutrient for the bacterium Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, the causative agent for tuberculosis;
a better understanding of its uptake may lead to novel therapeutics.44 To differentiate endogenously biosynthesized
trehalose from exogenously added trehalose, researchers often feed
bacteria trehalose radiolabeled with 14C or 2H.44 The LC–MS/MS-based assay is
a good approach for quantifying the exogenously added, radiolabeled
trehalose because it can distinguish between trehalose and a radiolabeled
analogue. Neither the enzymatic trehalose assay nor the HPLC-RID-based
assay can differentiate between these different disaccharides. Esterified
trehalose analogues have also recently been used to deliver trehalose
into mammalian cells; for trehalose quantification, one study used
the enzymatic trehalose assay and another study used the LC–MS/MS-based
assay.15,16 The concentrations of esterified trehalose
analogues from these cells could also be directly quantified using
the LC–MS/MS-based assay; it is unlikely that the enzymatic
trehalose assay or the HPLC-RID-based assay could detect these analogues.

Although the LC–MS/MS-based assay has its advantages, it
does require the use of matrix-matched standards for the calibration
curve; these are not necessary for the enzymatic trehalose assay or
the HPLC-RID-based assay. Moreover, LC–MS/MS instruments, though
very common, are fairly expensive (approximately U.S. $300 000).45 The instruments needed for the enzymatic trehalose
assay or the HPLC-RID-based assay are less expensive than an LC–MS/MS
system; a spectrophotometer equipped with a 96-well plate reader (for
the enzymatic trehalose assay) costs approximately U.S. $50 000,46 and an HPLC system equipped with an RID (for
the HPLC-RID-based assay) costs approximately U.S. $80 000.45

Although not directly evaluated in the
present study, high-performance
anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD)
and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) are
also used for trehalose quantification.25,26,29,35,36 Both of these methods are highly sensitive for trehalose. HPAEC-PAD,
like the trehalose enzymatic assay and the HPLC-RID-based assay, does
not conclusively identify trehalose on the basis of its amperometric
signal. In fact, one published report has concluded that HPAEC-PAD
is not an appropriate method for the quantification of trehalose from
complex biological samples such as plant extracts.36 Complex samples, like plant extracts, often contain other
biological compounds that coelute with trehalose, leading to an overestimation
of trehalose content.36 In contrast, GC–MS
does allow for the identification of trehalose in biological samples;
however, it requires the derivatization of trehalose with trimethylsilyl
ethers, thus adding an extra, time-consuming step to this method and
possibly introducing additional error.29,36 Therefore,
HPAEC-PAD and GC–MS need to be used with caution when quantifying
trehalose from complex biological samples.

In summary, the selection
of a suitable assay for trehalose quantification
will depend on the expected trehalose concentration in the sample
(nanomolar, micromolar, or millimolar), the complexity of the sample,
including the presence of interfering contaminants, and the type of
instrumentation available. The work described herein thus provides
guidance to trehalose researchers in their selection of the optimal
method for their desired application.

Conclusions
In
this study, three commonly used assays for the quantification
of trehalose from biological samples were compared: an enzymatic trehalose
assay, an HPLC-RID-based assay, and an LC–MS/MS-based assay.
All assays were found to be accurate for the quantification of trehalose
in a variety of biological matrices. The LC–MS/MS-based assay
is the most sensitive assay, with an LOD of 22 nM and an LOQ of 28
nM trehalose, which are 2–3 and 4–5 orders of magnitude
lower than those for the enzymatic trehalose assay or the HPLC-RID-based
assay, respectively. Moreover, the LC–MS/MS-based assay was
the only assay able to detect and quantify endogenous trehalose from
OtsA/OtsB overproducer E. coli cells;
the concentration of trehalose in lysates from these cells was too
low to be detected by either the enzymatic trehalose assay or the
HPLC-RID-based assay. Results from this study indicate that the LC–MS/MS-based
assay is the most direct and sensitive method for the quantification
of trehalose from biological samples; however, both the enzymatic
trehalose assay and the HPLC-RID-based assay are reliable, cost-effective
assays for applications not requiring the detection of nanomolar concentrations
of trehalose. With the increasing interest in studying trehalose’s
role in cellular protection, understanding the relative advantages
and limitations of the different assays for quantifying trehalose
from biological sources will enable researchers to select the method
best suited to their desired application.

and LC–MS-grade ammonium acetate (>99%) were purchased from
Fisher Scientific. 13C12-trehalose was purchased
from Omicron Biochemicals (South Bend, IN). Solvents (acetonitrile
and water) were of LC–MS/Optima grade and obtained from Fisher

Fisher Scientific. Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)-1640 medium
was purchased from America Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas,
VA). Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was obtained from Fisher Scientific,
and fetal bovine serum (FBS) was obtained from VWR. Trehalose Assay
Kit (K-TREH) was purchased from Megazyme International (Ireland).

Enzymatic Trehalose Assay
The enzymatic trehalose assay
(Trehalose Assay Kit) was completed in a 96-well plate following the
manufacturer’s microplate assay procedure.24 Briefly, standard solutions containing varying concentrations
of trehalose (25–100 μM) were prepared, and 20 μL
of each of these solutions were used for creating the calibration
curve. Next, 200 μL of distilled water, 20 μL of solution
1 (buffer), 10 μL of solution 2 (containing NADP+ and adenosine 5′-triphosphate), and 2 μL of solution
3 (containing the enzymes hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase)
were added to the wells. The solutions were mixed, and the absorbance
values at 340 nm (abs0) were obtained from these wells
prior to addition of the enzyme trehalase. Suspension 4 (2 μL,
containing the enzyme trehalase) was then added to the wells, the
solutions were mixed, and the reactions were allowed to incubate for
8 min at room temperature, after which the absorbance values were
measured at 340 nm (abs1). Calibration curves were generated
in Excel by plotting the background-corrected absorbance measurements
(abs1 – abs0) against trehalose concentration.
Averages of the corrected absorbance measurements for each standard
were calculated and plotted against the known concentrations. These
plots and the resulting best-fit equations were used for all further
calculations (e.g., determining the LOD and LOQ, calculating the trehalose
concentration of samples, etc.).

HPLC-RID Conditions
HPLC separation was achieved using
a Waters high-performance carbohydrate column (250 × 4.6 mm2, 4 μm) on an Agilent 1100 series HPLC system, including
a degasser, quaternary pump, autosampler, and column compartment (maintained
at 35 °C). The mobile phase was composed of water and acetonitrile.
Isocratic elution conditions were varied to optimize the separation
of trehalose, with an optimal flow rate of 1 mL/min and a percentage
of acetonitrile of 77% over 30 min. The injection volume was 50 μL,
and analyte detection was achieved using an Agilent 1260 Infinity
series refractive index detector. RI signals for trehalose were analyzed
using Agilent OpenLAB CDS ChemStation software; peaks were integrated
manually for consistency. Calibration curves were generated in Excel
by plotting the area of the RI signals against trehalose concentration.
Averages of the areas for each standard were calculated and plotted
against the known concentrations. These plots and the resulting best-fit
equations were used for all further calculations (e.g., determining
the LOD and LOQ, calculating the trehalose concentration of samples,
etc.).

LC–MS/MS Conditions
LC separation was achieved
using a Waters high-performance carbohydrate column (250 × 4.6
mm2, 4 μm) on an Agilent 1200 series HPLC system,
including a degasser, binary pump, autosampler, and column compartment
(maintained at 35 °C). The mobile phase was composed of water
containing 2 mM ammonium acetate (A) and acetonitrile containing 2
mM ammonium acetate (B). Isocratic elution conditions were varied
to optimize the separation of trehalose, with an optimal flow rate
of 1 mL/min and a percentage of solvent B of 80–82% over 20
min. The injection volume was 40 μL, and analyte detection was
achieved using an Agilent 6410B triple quadrupole mass spectrometer
with an electrospray ionization source. The mass spectrometer was
operated in selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode, monitoring for
the trehalose transitions of 360–163 m/z and 360–85 m/z and for the 13C12-trehalose transition of
377–209 m/z, all in positive
mode. The MS/MS conditions are listed in Table S4 (Supporting Information).

SRM signals for trehalose and 13C12-trehalose
were obtained and analyzed using Agilent MassHunter Quantitative Analysis
software; peaks were integrated manually when necessary for consistency.
Calibration curves were generated in the software by plotting the
relative response (the trehalose signal divided by the maltose signal)
against trehalose concentration. The software reports the accuracy
for each point on the basis of the curve it produces. Only data points
with accuracies between 80 and 120% were kept. Averages of the remaining
responses for each standard were calculated and plotted against the
known concentrations. These final plots and the resulting best-fit
equations were used for any further calculations (e.g., determining
the LOD and LOQ, calculating the trehalose concentration of samples,
etc.).

Escherichia coli (E. coli) Lysate Preparation
E. coli cells (strain DH5α) were a generous
gift from K. Fox (Union College). E. coli cells were plated on LB (Miller)-agar plates and allowed to grow
overnight at 37 °C. A single colony was picked from the plate,
placed in 5 mL of sterile LB, and shaken (275 rpm) at 37 °C for
23 h. The cells were centrifuged (3000 rcf × 10 min), and the
supernatant was removed. The cell pellet was resuspended in PBS (5
mL), centrifuged (3000 rcf × 10 min), and the supernatant was
removed. This process was repeated one more time, after which the
cell pellet was frozen at −80 °C until cell lysis.

The wild-type, trehalose knockout (ΔotsA)
of the E. coli strain MC4100 was created
by Kaasen et al. and was a generous gift from P. Woodruff (University
of Southern Maine).43 The ΔotsA strain was plated on LB (Miller)-agar plates containing
50 μM tetracycline and allowed to grow overnight at 37 °C.
A single colony was picked from the plate, placed in 5 mL of sterile
LB containing 50 μM tetracycline, and shaken (275 rpm) at 37
°C for 16 h. The ΔotsA strain starter
culture (1.5 mL) was then used to inoculate 100 mL of sterile LB containing
50 μM tetracycline, and the culture was shaken (275 rpm) at
37 °C for 4 h. The cells were centrifuged (3000 rcf × 10
min), and the supernatant was removed. The cell pellet was resuspended
in PBS (90 mL), centrifuged (3000 rcf × 10 min), and the supernatant
was removed. The cell pellet was then resuspended in PBS (5 mL) and
centrifuged (3000 rcf × 10 min) again. The supernatant was removed,
and the cell pellet was frozen at −80 °C until cell lysis.

The arabinose-inducible OtsA/OtsB overproducer of the E. coli strain MC4100 was created by Frederick et
al. and was a generous gift from P. Woodruff (University of Southern
Maine).42 The arabinose-inducible OtsA/OtsB
overproducer strain was plated on LB (Miller)-agar plates containing
100 μg/mL ampicillin and allowed to grow overnight at 37 °C.
A single colony was picked from the plate, placed in 25 mL of sterile
LB containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin, and shaken (275 rpm) at
37 °C for 17 h. The starter culture was used to inoculate 250
mL of sterile LB containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin, and the culture
was shaken (275 rpm) at 37 °C until OD600 ∼
0.6. Arabinose (1 mM) was used to induce the OtsA/OtsB overproducer
cells, and the culture was shaken (275 rpm) at 37 °C for 23 h.
The following day, another aliquot of arabinose (1 mM) was added to
the OtsA/OtsB overproducer cells, and the culture was shaken (275
rpm) at 37 °C for 5 h longer. The cell suspension (30 mL) was
centrifuged (3000 rcf × 10 min), and the supernatant was removed.
The cell pellet was resuspended in PBS (10 mL), centrifuged (3000
rcf × 10 min), and the supernatant was removed. The cell pellet
was then resuspended in PBS (10 mL) and centrifuged (3000 rcf ×
10 min) again. The supernatant was removed, and the cell pellet was
frozen at −80 °C until cell lysis.

For cell lysis,
DH5α cells (1.4 × 109 cells)
or ΔotsA cells (1.5 × 1010 cells)
were resuspended in 1.00 mL of water, and the OtsA/OtsB overproducer
cells (4 × 1010 cells) were resuspended in 150 μL
of water. These cell suspensions were heated at 100 °C for 20
min, after which they were centrifuged (16 000 rcf × 10
min) at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and kept frozen at
−80 °C until further use.

Jurkat Cell Lysate Preparation
Jurkat cells (clone
E6-1) were purchased from ATCC and grown in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented
with 10% FBS. The cells were maintained in a 5% CO2, water-saturated
environment at 37 °C. The cells were centrifuged (300 rcf ×
5 min), and the supernatant was removed. The cell pellet was resuspended
in PBS (5 mL), centrifuged (300 rcf × 5 min), and the supernatant
was removed. This process was repeated one more time, after which
the cell pellet was frozen at −80 °C until cell lysis.

For cell lysis, Jurkat cells (1 × 106 cells) were
resuspended in 100 μL of 10 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid buffer (pH 7.3) and flash-frozen
in liquid nitrogen. The cell suspensions were thawed and then flash-frozen
again in liquid nitrogen. This process was repeated one more time,
after which the cell suspension was centrifuged (14 000 rpm
× 10 min) at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and stored
at −80 °C until further use.

Method Sensitivities
Enzymatic
Trehalose Assay
To determine the instrument
LOD and LOQ for the enzymatic trehalose assay, standards ranging from
25 to 400 μM trehalose were prepared and subjected to the enzymatic
trehalase assay as described above (20 μL sample volume) to
generate a calibration curve. A solution of 20 μM trehalose
was prepared and subjected to the enzymatic trehalase assay (20 μL
sample volume). The absorbance values at 340 nm (abs0)
for the 20 μM trehalose solution were measured eight times and
then 2 μL of suspension 4 (containing the enzyme trehalase)
was added to the wells. The solutions were mixed, and the reactions
were allowed to incubate for 8 min at room temperature, after which
the absorbance values at 340 nm (abs1) were measured eight
times. The standard deviation (SD) of the corrected absorbance measurements
(abs1 – abs0) for all eight replicates
of the 20 μM trehalose sample was calculated. The instrument
LOD was calculated using the equation 3 × SD/m, where m is the slope of the trehalose calibration
curve. The instrument LOQ was calculated using the equation 10 ×
SD/m, where m is the slope of the
trehalose calibration curve.

this method, standards ranging from 25 to 400 μM trehalose were

A total of 10 solutions of 20 μM trehalose were prepared and

curve. The MQL was calculated using the equation 10 × SD/m, where m is the slope of the trehalose
calibration curve.

HPLC-RID Assay
To determine the
instrument LOD and
LOQ for the HPLC-RID assay, standards ranging from 1 to 100 mM trehalose
were prepared in 1:1 acetonitrile/water and injected in triplicate
(50 μL injection volume) onto the HPLC-RID to generate a calibration
curve. Another solution of 2.5 mM trehalose was prepared in 1:1 acetonitrile/water
and injected onto the HPLC-RID 10 times (50 μL sample volume).
The standard deviation (SD) of the RI signals for all 10 replicates
of the 2.5 mM trehalose sample was calculated. The instrument LOD
was calculated using the equation 3 × SD/m,
where m is the slope of the trehalose calibration
curve. The instrument LOQ was calculated using the equation 10 ×
SD/m, where m is the slope of the
trehalose calibration curve.

A total of 10 solutions of 2.5 mM trehalose in 1:1 acetonitrile/water
were prepared and injected onto the HPLC-RID 10 times (50 μL

all 10 solutions of the 2.5 mM trehalose sample was calculated. The
MDL was calculated using the equation 3 × SD/m, where m is the slope of the trehalose calibration
curve. The MQL was calculated using the equation 10 × SD/m, where m is the slope of the trehalose
calibration curve.

LC–MS/MS Assay
To determine
the LOD and LOQ
for the LC–MS/MS method, standards ranging from 0.2 to 2.0
μM trehalose (all containing 5 μM 13C12-trehalose) were prepared in 1:1 acetonitrile/water and injected
(40 μL injection volume) onto the LC–MS/MS to generate
a calibration curve. Another solution of 0.5 μM trehalose and
5 μM 13C12-trehalose in 1:1 acetonitrile/water
was prepared and injected six times onto the LC–MS/MS (40 μL
injection volume). The standard deviation of the relative responses
to trehalose for all six injections for the 0.5 μM trehalose
sample was calculated. This standard deviation was multiplied by 3
(3SD), and the instrument LOD was calculated using 3SD and the equation
from the trehalose calibration curve. The instrument LOQ was calculated
by multiplying the standard deviation by 10 (10SD), and 10SD was then
used in the equation from the trehalose calibration curve.

the equation from the trehalose calibration curve. The MQL was calculated
by multiplying the standard deviation by 10 (10SD), and 10SD was then
used in the equation from the trehalose calibration curve.

Method
Validation
To determine the accuracies of these
methods for calculating trehalose concentrations in samples, a series
of solutions containing known concentrations of trehalose (see Table 2 for trehalose concentrations)
were prepared in water for the enzymatic trehalose assay or 1:1 acetonitrile/water
for the HPLC-RID and LC–MS/MS assays. These solutions were
treated as samples for the three assays, and the concentration of
trehalose was calculated for each sample using the equation obtained
from the trehalose calibration curve for each assay. The percent recovery
was calculated using eq 1 1  The accuracies
of these methods were also
evaluated in both E. coli (strain DH5α)
lysates and Jurkat cell lysates using a spike recovery test. Known
amounts of trehalose (see Tables 3 and 4 for trehalose concentrations)
were spiked into these lysates, and samples were prepared in either
cell lysates (for the enzymatic trehalose assay) or in a mixture of
1:1 acetonitrile/cell lysates (for the HPLC-RID and LC–MS/MS
assays). These spiked lysates were treated as samples for the three
assays. For the enzymatic trehalose assay, the standards for the trehalose
calibration curve were prepared in water. For the HPLC-RID assay,
the standards for the trehalose calibration curve were prepared in
a mixture of 1:1 acetonitrile/water. For the LC–MS/MS assay,
the standards for the trehalose calibration curve were prepared in
a mixture of 1:1 acetonitrile/cell lysates (E. coli or Jurkat, depending on the lysates that had been spiked with trehalose)
to produce matrix-matched standards. The concentration of trehalose
was calculated for each lysate sample using the equation obtained
from the trehalose calibration curve for each assay. The percent recovery
for each lysate sample was calculated using eq 1.

Method Application
To apply this
method to the quantification
of endogenous trehalose from a biological source, lysates from the
arabinose-inducible OtsA/OtsB overproducer of the E.
coli strain MC4100 were analyzed.42 For the enzymatic trehalase assay, the cell lysates were
used as is; for the HPLC-RID assay, the cell lysates were diluted
1:1 with acetonitrile; and for the LC–MS/MS assay, the cell
lysates were diluted with acetonitrile and water and spiked with 13C12-trehalose to give lysates containing 10 μM 13C12-trehalose in 1:1 acetonitrile/lysates. For
the enzymatic trehalose assay, the standards for the trehalose calibration
curve were prepared in water. For the HPLC-RID assay, the standards
for the trehalose calibration curve were prepared in a mixture of
1:1 acetonitrile/water. For the LC–MS/MS assay, the standards
for the trehalose calibration curve were prepared in a mixture of
1:1 acetonitrile/ΔotsA lysates, which contain
no trehalose, to produce matrix-matched standards. The concentration
of trehalose was calculated for each lysate sample using the equation
obtained from the trehalose calibration curve for each assay. Intracellular
trehalose concentrations were calculated by taking the total moles
of trehalose in the lysates calculated from the trehalose calibration
curve and dividing it by the total bacterial volume as calculated
from the OD600 value (estimating the internal volume of
an E. coli cell as 0.7 μm3).34,42
