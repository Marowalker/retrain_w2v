Methionine (Met) is an essential
and multifunctional nutrient in
vertebrate diets. It is a precursor of S-adenosylmethionine
(SAM), the methyl donor for DNA methylation, which has an important
role in the inflammatory responses. However, whether Met exerts anti-inflammatory
effects by altering DNA methylation in macrophages is unclear. In
this study, Met was found to diminish the activation of the mitogen-activated
protein kinase signaling pathway; decrease the production of tumor
necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and interferon-β; and
enhance the levels of intracellular SAM after lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
treatment in macrophages. Similarly, SAM inhibited the LPS-induced
inflammatory response, consistent with the result of Met treatment.
Met-treated macrophages displayed increased global DNA methylation.
The DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine
partially blocked the anti-inflammatory effects of Met in macrophages,
suggesting a mechanism involving DNA methylation. Collectively, the
results indicated that Met inhibits the LPS-induced inflammatory response
by altering DNA methylation in RAW 264.7 macrophages. The findings
provide new insights into the interplay between nutrition and immunology,
and highlight the regulatory effects of amino acids on the host immune
system.

==== Body
Introduction
As an essential amino
acid in animals, methionine (Met) is closely
related to physiological processes including immune function, protein
synthesis, growth promotion, and detoxification.1 Met is converted to S-adenosylmethionine
(SAM), which is a methyl donor that has crucial roles in immune disorders
owing to its activities of epigenetic regulation, especially DNA methylation.2,3

DNA methylation is an important mammalian epigenetic mechanism
that is thought to be involved in inflammatory responses. Inflammation
is a key biological mechanism in an organism’s defense system
against harmful intruders. The methylation profiles on the cytosine-phosphate–guanine
(CpG) regions are involved in inflammation-response-related genes.4,5 Macrophages are a component of the innate immune system and play
important roles in its responses against bacterial and viral pathogens.6 Macrophages can be activated by several external
stimuli including lipopolysaccharides (LPS), which are a component
of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, lead to the activation
of the Toll-like receptor-4 signaling pathway, and induce the activation
of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), resulting in the secretion
of inflammatory cytokines.7 Previous studies
have demonstrated that DNA methylation modulates LPS-induced macrophage
inflammatory responses and maintains intestinal homeostasis by regulating
mucosal inflammation in the gut.8 Moreover,
Met could inhibit the LPS-induced expression of inflammation-related
genes in macrophage cells.9

However,
whether the mechanism by which Met exerts anti-inflammatory
effects involves DNA methylation in macrophages is poorly understood.
Here, we provide evidence that Met effectively inhibits LPS-induced
inflammatory responses partly through DNA methylation in RAW 264.7
macrophages.

Materials and Methods
Cell Culture
RAW
264.7 cells obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum and 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin at
37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cells
were preincubated for 12 h with Met or SAM and subsequently cultured
for 1.5–24 h in the presence of 100 ng/mL LPS. For the DNA
methylation inhibitor treatment, RAW 264.7 cells were pretreated with
5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)
for 24 h and then cultured with Met (or SAM) and LPS.

Cell Viability
Cells (5000 per well) were seeded into
a 96-well plate and treated with variable concentrations of Met for
24 h. A cell counting kit-8 (Dojindo, Tabaru, Japan) was used to label
cells for 1 h. The absorbance at 450 nm was then measured using a
plate reader, and cell viability was expressed as the percentage absorbance
of treated cells relative to that of untreated cells.

Reverse Transcription-Polymerase
Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and
Quantitative PCR
Total cellular RNA was extracted using the
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). RT-PCR was performed using
a one-step RNA-PCR kit (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) and SYBR Green master
mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturers’
protocols. β-Actin cDNA was used as an internal control to normalize
the amount of total RNA in each reaction. The results were expressed
as relative abundance [log(2 – ΔΔCt)]. The RT-PCR primers used were as follows: β-actin
forward 5′-GATGAGATTGGCATGGCTTT-3′, reverse 5′-CACCTTCACCGTTCCAGTTT-3′;
interleukin (IL)-6 forward 5′-AGTTGCCTTCTTGGGACTGA-3′,
reverse 5′-TCCACGATTTCCCAGAGAAC-3′; tumor necrosis factor-α
(TNF-α) forward 5′-CTGGGACAGTGACCTGGACT-3′, reverse
5′-GCACCTCAGGGAAGAGTCTG-3′; and interferon-β (IFN-β)
forward 5′-CCCTATGGAGATGACGGAGA-3′, reverse 5′-CTGTCTGCTGGTGGAGTTCA-3′.

Measurement of Cytokines
The protein concentrations
of interleukin IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-β in cell culture
supernatants were measured using murine cytokine-specific Quantikine
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (eBioscience, San Diego,
CA).

Western Blot
Protein extracts were separated on 10%
sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% fat-free milk at room temperature
for 1 h and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with a primary antibody
(Ab), followed by incubation with the appropriate horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated
reporter Ab (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) for 1 h at room temperature.
The enhanced chemiluminescence FluorChem E system (Bio-Techne, Minneapolis,
MN) was used for developing the reaction. Abs specific for the total
and phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), JNK1/2 (Thr183/Tyr185),
and p38 (Thr180/Tyr182) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology
(Danvers, MA). An Ab against β-actin was purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX).

High-Performance Liquid
Chromatography (HPLC) Analysis
The intracellular concentration
of SAM was measured by HPLC. RAW
264.7 cells were incubated with Met for 12 and 24 h. Then, the culture
medium was aspirated and the cell monolayer was washed with cold phosphate-buffered
saline. The cells were treated with 20% trichloroacetic acid at 4
°C for 4 h and then immediately frozen at −80 °C
until measurement. HPLC was performed on a model 1260 Infinity II
LC system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) using a ZORBAX Eclipse
Plus C18 column (Agilent Technologies) at 30 °C. The mobile phase
consisted of 0.01 mol/L ammonium formate/methanol (97:3, v/v, pH 3.0).
The flow rate was 0.8 mL/min, and the detection was performed at 260
nm.

Global DNA Methylation
DNA isolated from RAW 264.7
cells was used for global DNA methylation analyses.

Global DNA
methylation was determined by DNA quantification using a monoclonal
Ab against 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) in an ELISA-like reaction using
the MethylFlash methylated DNA quantification kit (Epigentek, Farmingdale,
NY), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The 5-mC
amount was calculated using a standard curve created using defined
dilutions of methylated genomic DNA. Methylation levels were calculated
relative to the methylated control DNA included in the kit and were
expressed as a percentage of total methylated DNA.

Statistical
Analysis
All data were expressed as mean
± standard deviation (SD). Comparisons between two groups were
performed using the Student’s t-test. Comparisons
among more than two groups were performed using one-way analysis of
variance with post hoc comparisons using Dunnett’s test. All
of the analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 4.0 software
(GraphPad Software, LaJolla, CA). Differences were considered significant
at p < 0.05.

Results
Met Reduces
the Production of LPS-Induced Proinflammatory Mediators
in Macrophages
The viability of RAW 264.7 cells did not change
following Met treatment (Supporting Information Figure S1). RAW 264.7 cells were incubated with the various
concentrations of Met (0.01–10 mM) for 12 h, followed by exposure
to LPS (100 ng/mL) for 3–12 h to evaluate the anti-inflammatory
effects of Met. The expression of TNF-α, IL-6, and IFN-β
mRNA was dramatically lower in the Met-treated cells as compared to
the control cells, and 10 mM Met was chosen as the optimal concentration
for use in subsequent experiments (Supporting Information Figure S2). The relative expression of genes
encoding TNF-α, IL-6, and IFN-β was considerably lower
with 10 mM Met for 12 h (Figure 1A–C). Meanwhile, the results of ELISA analysis
to determine the concentrations of TNF-α, IL-6, and IFN-β
in the culture supernatant at 24 h were consistent with the enhanced
gene expression (Figure 1D–F). Collectively, the data indicated that Met inhibited
the LPS-induced inflammatory response in RAW 264.7 macrophages.

Figure 1 Met inhibits
the LPS-induced inflammatory stress in RAW 264.7 macrophages.
RAW 264.7 cells were pretreated with 10 mM Met for 12 h prior to stimulation
with 100 μg/mL LPS for 3 h. The gene expression of (A) IL-6,
(B) TNF-α, and (C) IFN-β was analyzed by RT-qPCR. (D–F)
Effects of Met on LPS-stimulated IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-β
secretion from RAW 264.7 cells were analyzed by ELISA. Cells were
cultured for 12 h with Met (10 mM) and then treated with LPS (100
ng/mL) for 12 h. Data represent the mean ± SD of three independent
experiments, each performed in five samples. Comparisons among means
used t-tests (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).

Met Suppresses the LPS-Induced Activation
of MAPK Signaling
in Macrophages
To evaluate the inhibitory effect of Met on
LPS-induced proinflammatory responses in RAW 264.7 cells, the protein
phosphorylation levels of three MAPK proteins (ERK, p38, and JNK)
were determined. As shown in Figure 2, LPS treatment induced the phosphorylation of ERK,
p38, and JNK, and their phosphorylation levels peaked at 30 min. The
phosphorylation levels of p38, ERK1/2, and JNK in the Met-treated
group were lower than those in the LPS-treated group. These data indicated
that Met suppressed the LPS-induced activation of MAPK signaling in
RAW 264.7 cells.

Figure 2 Met inhibits the LPS-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated
protein kinases (MAPK) in RAW 264.7 macrophages. RAW 264.7 cells were
cultured for 12 h with Met (10 mM) and then treated with LPS (100
ng/mL) for 0, 5, 15, 30, and 60 min. Western blotting assays for phospho-ERK1/2
(p-ERK1/2), ERK1/2, p-JNK, JNK, p-p38, and p38 were performed. β-Actin
was used as the loading control. Levels for target phosphorylated
proteins were normalized to total proteins. All data shown are representative
of three independent experiments.

SAM Reduces the Production of LPS-Induced Proinflammatory Mediators
in Macrophages
HPLC analysis revealed that the concentration
of SAM in cell culture supernatants significantly increased following
Met treatment (Figure 3A,B). We explored whether the Met-derivative SAM was involved in
the regulation of the LPS-induced inflammatory response in macrophages.
The production of TNF-α, IL-6, and IFN-β in RAW 264.7
cells upon LPS stimulation was significantly inhibited at the mRNA
and protein levels after SAM treatment (Figure 3C–H).

Figure 3 Met-derivative SAM inhibits the LPS-induced
inflammatory stress
in RAW 264.7 macrophages. (A, B) Intracellular concentration of SAM
was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. RAW 264.7
cells were pretreated with 0.5 mM SAM for 12 h prior to stimulation
with 100 μg/mL LPS for 3 h. The gene expression levels of (C)
IL-6, (D) TNF-α, and (E) IFN-β were analyzed by RT-qPCR.
(F–H) Effects of Met on LPS-stimulated IL-6, TNF-α, and
IFN-β in RAW 264.7 cells were analyzed by ELISA. The cells were
cultured for 12 h with Met (10 mM) and then treated with LPS (100
ng/mL) for 12 h. Data represent the mean ± SD of three independent
experiments, each performed in five samples. Comparisons among means
used t-tests (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).

SAM Inhibits LPS-Induced MAPK Signaling in
Macrophages
To confirm the effects of the Met-derivative
SAM on the LPS-initiated
activation of MAPK, we examined phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2,
JNK1/2, and p38 in RAW 264.7 cells by western blotting. SAM inhibited
the LPS-induced activation of all three MAPKs (Figure 4), consistent with the results of Met treatment.

Figure 4 SAM inhibits
the LPS-induced phosphorylation of MAPKs in RAW 264.7
macrophages. RAW 264.7 cells were cultured for 12 h with SAM (0.5
mM) and then treated with LPS (100 ng/mL) for 0, 5, 15, 30, and 60
min. Western blotting assays for phospho-ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2), ERK1/2,
p-JNK, JNK, p-p38, and p38 were performed. β-Actin was used
as the loading control. Levels for target phosphorylated proteins
were normalized to total proteins. All data shown are representative
of three independent experiments.

Global Methylation Level Following Met Treatment
To
analyze the influence of Met on DNA methylation, a monoclonal Ab against
5-mC was utilized to quantify the global methylation level using the
MethylFlash methylated DNA quantification kit. The relative genome-wide
methylated DNA methylation level of the control was 0.13 ± 0.02%
(Figure 5A). After
treatment with 10 μM Met, the methylation level significantly
increased to 0.37 ± 0.09% (p < 0.05; Figure 5A). The absolute
amount of 5-mC in the control cells was 0.14 ± 0.02 ng, whereas
it increased to 0.40 ± 0.09 ng in the Met-treated cells (Figure 5B). To check whether
Met-derivative SAM was involved in DNA methylation, the DNA methylation
of SAM-treated macrophages was further analyzed. We also found that
SAM effectively enhanced the level of DNA methylation in macrophages
(Figure 5C,D). These
data suggested that Met treatment significantly induced genome-wide
methylation in macrophages.

Figure 5 Met increases the global methylation level of
RAW 264.7 macrophages.
RAW 264.7 cells were cultured for 12 h with Met (0.1, 1, and 10 mM)
and SAM (0.5 mM). (A) Relative and (B) absolute amounts of 5-mC were
analyzed with Met treatment. (C) Relative and (D) absolute amounts
of 5-mC were analyzed with SAM treatment. A statistically significant
difference in the genome methylation was seen between the control
and Met-treated macrophages. Comparisons among means were performed
using t-tests (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001). All data
shown are representative of three independent experiments. aThe absolute amount of 5-mC in the control cells was 0.14 ±
0.02 ng, whereas it increased to 0.40 ± 0.09 ng in the Met-treated
cells (Figure 5B).
To check whether Met-derivative SAM was involved in DNA methylation,
the DNA methylation of SAM-treated macrophages was further analyzed.
We also found that SAM effectively enhanced the level of DNA methylation
in macrophages (Figure 5C,D).

DNA Methylation is Required
for the Anti-Inflammatory Effects
of Met in Macrophages
The DNA methyltransferase inhibitor
5-aza influences immune regulation.10 The
secretion of TNF-α, IL-6, and IFN-β from RAW 264.7 cells
significantly increased following the treatment with 2 μM 5-aza
(Figure 6A–C).
Thus, 5-aza treatment reduced the anti-inflammatory effects of Met
in macrophages. With 5-aza pretreatment, a reduction in global DNA
methylation was also detected in Met-treated macrophages (Figure 6D,E). Together, these
data demonstrated that DNA methylation mediated the anti-inflammatory
effects of Met in macrophages.

Figure 6 DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine
attenuates
the anti-inflammatory effects of Met in macrophages. RAW 264.7 cells
were pretreated with 2 μM 5-aza for 24 h prior to stimulation
with 100 ng/mL LPS for 3 h. (A–C) Effects of Met (10 mM) on
the LPS-induced production of IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-β in
RAW 264.7 cells were analyzed by ELISA. Cells were cultured for 24
h with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (2 μM) and then treated
with Met (10 mM) for 12 h. (D, E) Percentage of cytosine bases modified
with a 5-methyl group was determined. Data represent the mean ±
SD of three independent experiments, each performed in five samples.
Comparisons among means used t-tests (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).

Discussion
In
this study, we demonstrated that Met exerted anti-inflammatory
effects in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages by inhibiting the
LPS-induced activation of p38, ERK, and JNK MARKs. The Met-derivative
SAM also inhibited the inflammatory response via DNA methylation in
RAW 264.7 cells.

Met is an essential and multifunctional nutrient
in vertebrate
diets. Met is a precursor of SAM, which is the methyl donor for DNA
methylation.11 LPS is expressed in the
outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and plays a key role in the
initiation of inflammation by binding to Toll-like receptor-4; activation
of downstream inflammatory signaling pathways, including MAPK; and
induction of the production of inflammatory mediators.12 We found that the production of TNF-α,
IL-6, and IFN-β in RAW 264.7 cells after LPS stimulation was
significantly inhibited at the mRNA and protein levels with Met treatment
(Figure 1). Furthermore,
Met inhibited the LPS-induced phosphorylation and activation of the
JNK, ERK, and p38 MAPKs (Figure 2). MAPK signaling can upregulate the production of
proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α and IL-6, in LPS-stimulated
macrophages.13,14 Our findings suggest that the
anti-inflammatory properties of Met in LPS-treated RAW 264.7 macrophages
are probably attributable to its inhibition of the LPS-stimulated
activation of MAPKs.

Met is converted to SAM by Met adenosyltransferase.
SAM is a cofactor
that serves mainly as the principal methyl donor for DNA methylation.11 To further determine whether SAM has an anti-inflammatory
activity, we first checked concentration of SAM in RAW 267.4 macrophages
following Met treatment. Treatment with Met increased the cellular
concentration of SAM 2-fold compared with control cells (Figure 3). Moreover, SAM
inhibited the LPS-induced activation of the p38, JNK, and ERK1/2 MARKs
and reduced LPS-induced production of proinflammatory mediators (Figures 3 and 4), consistent with the results of Met treatment. SAM is the
principal methyl donor in biological reactions including DNA methylation,
which plays a critical role in immune function, and is associated
with several immune deficiencies and autoimmune disorders.15

Our observation that Met increased the
global methylation level
compared with the control indicates that the anti-inflammatory effects
of Met may operate through changes in DNA methylation (Figure 5). Therefore, we next investigated
whether Met modulates DNA methylation, to regulate the LPS-induced
inflammatory response in macrophages. Previous studies showed that
5-aza is an epigenetic modifier and inhibits DNA methyltransferase
activity, which results in DNA demethylation.16−18 We treated
macrophages with the nucleoside-based DNA methyltransferase inhibitor
5-aza and evaluated whether it affects the anti-inflammatory effects
of Met in macrophages. The 5-aza treatment attenuated the anti-inflammatory
effects of Met and augmented the production of proinflammatory mediators
by inhibiting DNA methylation in macrophages (Figure 6). Changes in the methylation status of promoter
regions and especially CpG sites can regulate the expression and activation
of various cytokines.19 Similarly, the
IL-1β promoter of promyeloid cells is demethylated during their
differentiation into monocytic cells to facilitate the accessibility
of the transcriptional machinery to the promoter, which affects the
subsequent production of IL-1β.20 Our understanding of the roles played by epigenetic modifications
in inflammation remains rudimentary. Further research will be needed
to study the associations between Met and global DNA methylation,
gene-level methylation, and the silencing of gene-associated inflammation
responses.

In summary, the results indicate that Met attenuates
the LPS-induced
inflammation associated with the Met-derivative SAM-mediated DNA methylation
in RAW 264.7 macrophages. The findings provide new insights into the
regulation of the actions of amino acids on the host immune system.
