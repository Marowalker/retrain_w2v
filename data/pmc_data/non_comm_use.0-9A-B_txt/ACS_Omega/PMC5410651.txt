Extensive efforts
have been made to regulate surface wettability
using bivalent polymers composed of hydrophobic surface-reactive groups
and hydrophilic groups. To further enhance the controllability, this
study demonstrates that the balance between the surface reactivity
and self-aggregation of bivalent poly(hydroxyethyl-co-methacryloxyethyl aspartamide) (PHMAA) is crucial in controlling
the wettability of methacrylated glass and thus the adhesion of stem
cells. In particular, the wettability of the glass and the subsequent
cell spreading became maximal with PHMAA that led to the largest and
most uniform coverage of hydroxyl groups. In summary, this study would
be useful in advancing various molecules used for surface engineering.

Introduction
The technologies developed
to regulate surface wettability have
garnered much attention due to its usefulness in innumerable applications,
such as printing,1 liquid separation,2 self-cleaning,3 and
biomolecular and cell manufacturing.4 In
particular, the surface energy of materials used for cell biology
studies and large-scale cell manufacturing influences protein adsorption5 and conformation,6 and, in turn, regulates cell adhesion. For example, hydrophilic
materials can promote the deposition of endogenous cell adhesion proteins
and hence stimulate cell adhesion.7 In
contrast, hydrophobic materials show competition between albumin and
cell adhesion proteins toward adsorption,8 thereby hindering cell adhesion to the substrate.9

Prior studies commonly controlled surface energy
by altering the
chemical compositions of materials used in cell culture, which include
glass, plastic, and silicon. However, this approach can influence
other properties that can potentially affect the cellular response
to materials, which include mechanical properties and permeability.
This challenge prompted efforts to control surface wettability of
materials without altering their bulk properties. One popular approach
is to introduce desired chemical groups exclusively on the surface
using chemical treatments, chemical vapor deposition,10 and corona11 or plasma12 treatments. Alternatively, a series of fabrication
techniques developed to control surface topology can control the surface
energy of materials. However, these methods often require sophisticated
and expensive processing units and high-level skills, thus making
it difficult for industrial-scale manufacturing of materials.

To this end, it is popular to tailor the surface energy of cell
adhesion substrates by coating the substrates with a controlled number
of hydrophilic groups. As success in this approach relies on the sustained
presence of the hydrophilic polymers on the substrate, it is common
to use amphiphilic polymers, which are widely being used for surface
coating and functionalization of various materials, with chemical
groups reactive to the substrate.13−15 In particular, hydrophobic
units, such as methacrylate (MA) groups, are often coupled to the
polymer so as to create covalent bonds with substrates that are pretreated
to present MA groups. However, self-aggregation between these hydrophobic
moieties may hamper the controllability of the substrate surface energy
and subsequent cell adhesion, depending on the degree of substitution
(DS) of the hydrophobic moieties. No systematic study has been made
to address the potential effect of hydrophobic and chemically reactive
groups on cell adhesion.

In this study, we hypothesized that
the balance between surface
reactivity and self-aggregation of the surface modifier would play
a significant role in regulating the surface energy and ultimately
cell adhesion. We examined this hypothesis by using poly(hydroxyethyl-co-methacryloxyethyl aspartamide) (PHMAA) as a model surface
modifier because of minimal toxicity and easy chemical modifications.
The hydroxyl (OH) group of PHMAA was used as a hydrophilic epitope
of PHMAA, whereas the MA group was used as a hydrophobic one that
is reactive to the substrates with MA groups. We used glass coverslips
pretreated to present MA groups as a model substrate. The role of
polymers was evaluated (1) by measuring the contact angle, (2) imaging
OH groups of the substrate with Raman microscopy, (3) characterizing
intermolecular association with pyrene probes, and (4) quantifying
the number of cells adhered to the substrate. Previously, PHMAA was
used as a protein linker that allows conjugations of extracellular
matrix proteins to various substrates. Apart from the previous study,
this study would focus on regulating the surface energy of the substrate
by using PHMAA with controlled DS of MA groups.16

Results and Discussion
PHMAA was synthesized by a sequential
reaction of 2-aminoethyl
methacrylate (2-AEMA) and ethanolamine with polysuccinimide (PSI)
(Figure 1). The molar
ratio between 2-AEMA and the succinimide of PSI was regulated to control
the DS of the MA (DSMA) group from 0 to 10%, as characterized
by the 1H NMR spectra (Figure S1, Table 1). Separately,
the molar ratio between ethanolamine and succinimide of PSI was stoichiometrically
altered to vary the DS of OH groups (DSOH) from 95 to 85%
to have the number of unopened succinimide rings in PHMAA maintained
constant in all groups. The resulting DSOH ranged from
92 to 81% based on 1H NMR spectra (Figure S1, Table 1). The molar ratio between MA and OH groups ranged from 0
to 11% (Table 1).

of 2-AEMA (1) and ethanolamine (2) to PSI.

The resulting PHMAAs with varied DSMA were used to coat
the glass pretreated to present MA groups using a silane reagent.
The polymers mixed with a photoinitiator, Irgacure 2959, were placed
on the glass and exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light for immobilization.
The immobilized PHMAA significantly changed the surface energy of
the glass, which was analyzed by measuring the contact angle of a
liquid water droplet (Figure 2). The contact angle of a water droplet on the methacrylated
glass was around 70°. Increasing DSMA from 0 to 5%
reduced the contact angle of a water droplet from 68 to approximately
55°. According to the Young equation,17 increasing DSMA from 0 to 5% made 1.7-fold increase of
the glass/liquid interface energy. However, further increase of DSMA to 10% rather increased the contact angle of a water droplet
to 60°.

samples per condition, respectively. *Statistical significance between

Using Raman spectroscopy coupled
with a microscope, the spatial
distribution of OH groups on the glass surface was mapped to underlie
the mechanism by which the DSMA of PHMAA modulates the
surface energy of the glass. Raman microscopic imaging was carried
out with peaks at 1600–1700 cm–1, as OH bending
is shown near 1640 cm–1.18 According to the Raman spectra and image, both bare glass surface
treated to present MA groups and glass treated with poly(hydroxyethyl
aspartamide) (PHA) groups presented a minimal number of OH groups.
No peak at 1600–1700 cm–1 that represents
the OH group was observed under these conditions (Figure 3A). Accordingly, the Raman
image of the glass surface did not display the area that marked the
presence of OH groups, indicated by the red color intensity (Figure 3A–C). This
result confirms that PHA minimally adheres to the glass surface due
to the absence of MA groups.

(C) Quantifications of (I) the relative area of the OH-coated surface

average values and standard deviation of three different samples per
condition, respectively. *Statistical significance between DSMA of 5 and 10% for the difference in the relative area of
the OH-coated surface (C-I), the number of OH-free islands (C-II),
and the area of OH-free islands (C-III) (*p <
0.05).

In contrast, glass coated with
PHMAA with 2% DSMA presented
OH groups. The surface area covered by OH groups reached 50% of the
entire surface. A further increase in DSMA to 5% raised
the area percentage to present OH groups to more than 95% (Figure 3). This enhanced
coverage of OH groups is well related to the increase in surface energy
evaluated by contact angle measurements. This result is owing to the
larger number of PHMAA that stably adhered to the glass surface, which
led to the larger number of OH groups on the surface.

Interestingly,
glass surfaces coated with PHMAA with 5 and 10%
DSMA presented some circular island areas free of OH groups
(Figure 3). In particular,
PHMAA with DSMA of 10% created a larger number of OH group-free
islands on the glass surface than PHMAA with DSMA of 5%
(Figure 3C). The average
diameter of islands was almost 2-fold greater with PHMAA with DSMA of 10% (Figure 3C). The area percentage of OH groups was slightly decreased
by increasing DSMA from 5 to 10% (Figure 3C).

The larger OH-free islands made
by PHMAA with DSMA of
10% implicated that self-aggregation between PHMAA molecules would
be another key factor to influence the surface coverage of OH groups
and the subsequent contact angle of the water droplet. Therefore,
the self-association between PHMAA with varying DSMA was
evaluated by examining the intermolecular organization of water-soluble
8-aminopyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid trisodium salt (denoted as pyrene
trisulfonates) in the polymer solution. The pyrene trisulfonates dissolved
in water display an active “excimer” peak at approximately
490 nm and a “monomer” peak at approximately 420 nm
when excited at 330 nm.19,20 Note that the “excimer”
represents pyrene probes stacked together. The water-soluble pyrene
trisulfonates form excimers in aqueous media because the intermolecular
arrangement is thermodynamically favorable. We suggest that the amphiphilic
PHMAA polymer hinders this excimer formation by intercalating MA groups
into the space between pyrene trisulfonates and, in turn, weakening
the π–π bonds between pyrene molecules. We propose
that effect of OH groups on the change in pyrene excimer fraction
is not significant because the hydrophilic OH groups mainly interact
with sulfonate groups substituted to the pyrene ring.

Interestingly,
the pyrene trisulfonates introduced into the aqueous
solution of PHA free from MA groups exhibited excimer peaks with the
same height as that of pyrene
trisulfonates introduced into polymer-free aqueous media (Figure 4A). In contrast,
pyrene trisulfonates added into the aqueous solutions of PHMAA with
DSMA being 2 and 5% exhibited a significant decrease in
the excimer emission intensity (Iex).
A further increase of DSMA to 10% resulted in another decrease
in Iex. Therefore, the ratio of emission
intensity between the excimer and monomer (Iex/Imo) was almost inversely proportional
to the DSMA (Figure 4B5). The decrease in Iex/Imo of pyrene trisulfonates
in the polymer solution indicates the extent of self-aggregation between
amphiphilic polymers such as PHMAA. In particular, the result implicates
that MA groups of PHMAA actively self-associate at DSMA of 10%, thus significantly inhibiting the excimer formation of pyrene
probes in the media. It is highly likely that self-association of
the MA groups of PHMAA with DSMA of 10% prevents the crosslinking
between MA groups of PHMAA and the coverslip, which results in larger
OH-free islands and decreased surface wettability (Figure 5).

In PHMAA, the blue segment represents OH groups, the violet segment

This controlled surface energy
of the glass influenced the adhesion
of cells to the substrate. This study used bone marrow-derived mesenchymal
stem cells (MSCs) as a model cell. MSCs have recently emerged as a
new regenerative medicine because of their potential to differentiate
multiple tissue-forming cells and secrete a series of therapeutic
growth factors and cytokines.21,22 As the successful use
of these cells relies on the capability to produce them on a large
scale, extensive efforts have been made to optimize the extracellular
microenvironment, including the surface energy of substrates used
for in vitro cell manufacturing. MSCs were placed on the glass surface
coated by PHMAA with varying DSMA. After incubation for
3 h, MSCs showed two different states of adhesion: some cells stably
adhered to the substrate and started to spread, whereas others remained
round due to poor adhesion (Figure 6A). The glass coated with PHMAA with DSMA of 5% displayed the maximal number of cells that stably adhered
to the glass (Figure 6A,C).

DSMA of 5 and 10% for the difference in the area of cells.

The long-term stability of the
PHMAA coating was evaluated by examining
the adhesion and proliferation of MSCs plated on the substrate over
a week. MSCs were seeded at either a lower concentration of 250 cells/cm2 or a higher concentration of 2500 cells/cm2. The
number of cells initially adhered was maximal with the glass coated
with PHMAA with DSMA of 5%, regardless of the cell seeding
density (Figure S2). The cells proliferated
and became confluent throughout 5–7 days of cell culture (Figure S2). This result concludes that PHMAA
coupled to the glass surface can stably support cell adhesion and
proliferation.

Consistent with the analysis of the cell attachment,
the extent
of cell spreading was also regulated by DSMA of PHMAA used
to coat the glass surface. In this analysis, intracellular actin filaments
were stained with fluorescently labeled phalloidin. MSCs cultured
on the methacrylated glass and those on the glass treated with PHA
displayed a round morphology. Most actin filaments were localized
along the edge of a cell membrane (Figure 6B). PHMAA with DSMA of 5% led
to the maximum spreading of cells (Figure 6B,D). In particular, PHMAA with DSMA of 5% made almost 2-fold increase of the cell spreading area than
PHA free of MA groups. In contrast, the glass coated with PHMAA with
10% DSMA decreased the extent of cell spreading compared
with the glass covered with PHMAA with 5% DSMA.

These
cell adhesion properties regarding the cell attachment rate
and spreading were well related to the contact angle of water droplets
placed on the glass surface. In particular, the number of adhered
cells and the extent of cell spreading became maximal on the glass
surface, which led to the lowest contact angle of the water droplets.
As the contact angle of the water droplet represents the surface energy
of a substrate, we propose that cell adhesion is solely dependent
on the surface energy controlled with PHMAA engineered to present
controlled DSMA.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the results
of this study demonstrate that a balance
between the reactivity and self-association of PHMAA plays a significant
role in regulating the surface energy of and, in turn, cell adhesion
to a cell culture substrate. Either PHA or PHMAA with a low DSMA (e.g., 2%) could not sufficiently increase the surface energy
of glass used for cell culture substrates because of low reactivity
to the methacrylated glass. Therefore, cells could not properly adhere
and spread on the substrate. In contrast, PHMAAs with a high DSMA (e.g., 10%) self-associate in aqueous solution and subsequently
form hydrophobic islands on the substrate, which negatively affects
cell attachment and spreading. Overall, the cell attachment and spreading
were maximal on the glass coated with PHMAA with 5% DSMA due to the balance between surface reactivity and intermolecular
association. We propose that this new finding will be highly useful
in advancing the coating quality of a wide array of molecules used
to modulate the surface properties of cell culture and manufacturing
substrates.

Materials and Methods
Materials
All chemicals were purchased
from Sigma unless
specified otherwise.

PHMAA Synthesis
PSI was synthesized
by acid-catalyzed
polycondensation of l-aspartic acid (Sigma, MO).1 Designated amounts of 2-AEMA (Sigma) and ethanolamine
were added sequentially to PSI dissolved in dimethylformamide. The
molar ratio of 2-AEMA was adjusted to regulate the DS of MA groups
(DSMA) from 0 to 10%. The molar ratio of ethanolamine was
adjusted to regulate the DS of hydroxyl groups from 95 to 85%, respectively.
The molar amounts of the reagents used for the reactions are listed in Table 2.

the Reagents Used

ethanolamine	0.019	0.0186	0.018	0.017	
AEMA	0	0.0004	0.001	0.002	
The
resulting polymer was dissolved in DMSO-d6 (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.) and analyzed by 1H NMR (Varian Unity 500 MHz). DSMA and DSOH were calculated from the integrated peaks of the 1H NMR
spectra using the following equations2    

Coating of
Glass with PHMAA
To coat glass with PHMAA,
glass was first modified to present MA groups. Briefly, coverslips
were treated with Piranha (25% H2SO4, 15% H2O2) for 1 h, then rinsed with H2O and
ethanol, and dried. The treated glass was submerged in a solution
of 2% (v/v) 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate (Sigma) dissolved
in ethanol for 30 min. The solution pH was adjusted to 5.0 with glacial
acetic acid. Then, the MA-group-coated glass was washed with ethanol
and dried. To conjugate PHMAA on the MA-modified glass, the modified
coverslips were submerged in PHMAA (20 mg/mL) mixed with 0.01% Irgacure
2959 (Ciba), and the polymer solution was exposed to UV light for
20 min to activate the radical crosslinking reaction.

Hydroxyl Group
Mapping Using the Raman Microscope
Raman
spectra of OH groups on the glass surface were mapped using the Nanophoton
Raman-11 Laser Raman Microscope system equipped with a 532 nm wavelength
laser. For each spectrum, a grating (600 nm–1) scan
was taken over the range 1400–3600 cm–1.
The spectral intensity was normalized to the hydroxyl peak at 1600–1800
cm–1.

Analysis of Pyrene-Based Intermolecular Association
The hydrophobic interactions between PHMAA in the solution were
assessed
by the monomer and excimer emission of pyrene probes. Stock solution
(1 μL) of 8-aminopyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid (pyrene, 100
μg/mL in cyclohexane) was added to 1 mL of PHMAA solution (20
mg/mL) with varying DSMA. The mixtures were sonicated for
1 min to completely dissolve the pyrene and incubated for 1 day. The
mixture was excited at a wavelength of 330 nm, and the resulting emission
spectrum of pyrene in each solution ranging from 350 to 600 nm was
acquired using a spectrofluorometer (FluoroMax-4, HORIBA Jobin Yvon).

Cell Culture and Analyses
Mouse bone marrow-derived
MSCs (D1, ATCC) between passages 21 and 25 were cultured in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (Gibco-BRL), containing 10% (v/v) fetal
bovine serum (Gibco-BRL) and 1% (v/v) penicillin–streptomycin
(Gibco-BRL). MSCs were plated at a cell density of 1 × 105 cells/cm2 and examined after 3 h. Cells were fixed,
permeabilized, and sequentially incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin
(Molecular Probes) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma).
Then, cell actins and the nucleus were imaged using a laser scanning
confocal microscope (LSM 710, Zeiss).

Statistical Analysis
The results were expressed as
mean ± standard deviation and the data were analyzed using the
Graph pad prism 6.0 software. Statistical analysis was performed using
one-way analysis of variance with the Tukey significant difference
post hoc test. The p-value <0.05 (95% confidence
interval) was considered to be significantly different.
