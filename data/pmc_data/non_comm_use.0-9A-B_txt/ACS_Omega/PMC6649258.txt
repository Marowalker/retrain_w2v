Herein, we reported nanoparticle
growth from the point of view
of the local electronic structure by taking MgO as a prototype material.
These nanoparticles were obtained from the sol–gel autocombustion
process. The precursor formed in this process was annealed for various
temperatures ranging from 300 to 1200 °C for 0.5 and 1 h. It
was observed that the amorphous phase occurred in the material synthesized
at an annealing temperature of 300 °C for 1 h. This phase transformed
to crystalline when the annealing temperature was increased to 350 °C.
Crystallite size increased with annealing temperature; however, annealing
time did not influence the crystallite size. To get deeper insights
of modifications occurring at the atomic scale during crystallization
growth, the local electronic structure of synthesized materials was
investigated by measuring near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure
at Mg, O, N, and C K-edges. These results envisaged that Mg2+ ion coordination improved with the increase of annealing temperature.
It was also observed that both annealing time and annealing temperature
are sensitive to the local electronic structural changes.

1 Introduction
Understanding
of grain growth phenomenon is important in the sense
as it provides an opportunity to control/improve the characteristics
of materials/devices. Yongan et al. reported that the grain
growth, induced by nanoparticles, increases efficiency of solar cells
based on selenide thin films.1 Crisp et
al. observed that solar cell performance of CdTe ink-based photovoltaics
depends on the initial crystallite size and shape as well as to the
crystalline structure.2 Grain growth not
only affects the photovoltaic response of devices but also influences
the other properties as well. Amara et al. investigated that the nature
of grain growth affects the dielectric behavior of Ti-rich SrTiO3.3 Thus, there have been attempt
by researchers to understand this phenomenon in nanoparticles with
a suitable technique. Ingham et al. reported aggregation and grain
growth phenomena in Au nanoparticle using synchrotron X-ray diffraction
(XRD) and the small-angle X-ray scattering.4 This group has also investigated the grain growth of Al-doped zinc
oxide nanocrystals and observed higher value of activation energy
for Al doping.5 Similar investigations
were carried out for nanocrystalline Cr6 and Fe.7 Grain growth of anatase TiO2 is described by an Arrhenius equation.8 Enhanced resistivity of electrically conductive nonoxide
ceramics is associated with insulating conductive pathways through
conductive grains in sintered body by the addition of an insulating
grain boundary phase.9 In concurrent with
the existing knowledge of grain growth, we focus our attention to
investigate the changes occurring at atomic scale. This kind of investigation
not only helps to understand the phenomena occurring at microscale
but also persists a way to tailor the properties of synthesized nanomaterials
in a controlled manner. In the realm of synthesizing nanomaterials,
top-down and bottom-up approaches are commonly utilized.10,11 Whereas the top-down approach is the formation of nanoparticles
from bulk precursor either by milling12,13 or mechanical
attrition,14,15 the bottom-up approach utilizes
atom by atom interaction based on chemical reactions.16,17 The bottom-up approaches are preferred because of low-power consumption
and their cost effectiveness. Moreover, atom by atom reaction induces
grain growth. Thus, stress, strain, and defects induced by milling/attrition
are negligible. The most common methods utilizing bottom-up approaches
are sol–gel,18 hydrothermal,19,20 and autocombustion synthesis.21,22 It is observed that
properties are sometimes drastically different even having similar
size of nanoparticles when synthesized using two or more methods.
Chemical methods need an organic matrix to promote grain growth.16−22 The formation of template during synthesis along with nanoparticle
is possible. However, most of studies ignore this aspect. Thus, the
present work is motivated to investigate the nanoparticle growth using
a suitable technique by taking a simple system as a prototype material.
In this context, a simple inorganic material, MgO, having a rocksalt
structure is selected. Though bulk MgO is highly insulating, nonmagnetic,
and nontransparent material (UV–vis region),23 nanoparticles of this material exhibit do ferromagnetism,24 improved optical,25 and dielectric behavior.26 Because of
highly insulating nature, it finds applications in magnetic tunnel
junctions27 and works as a template for
several chemical reactions.28−30 Thus, important findings and
applications motivate us to understand the growth of MgO using the
sol–gel autocombustion synthesis. To investigate atom by atom
interaction during growth, a technique which provides element-specific
information is highly desirable. We utilized near-edge X-ray absorption
fine structure measurements (NEXAFS) which not only give information
specific to valence state but also intriguing to crystallographic
environment.31 Moreover, Mg K-edge spectra
of MgO is very sensitive to the local coordination of constituted
ions as observed in previous studies from our group32,33 as well as other group.34−36 Thus, investigation specific
to local electronic structure during growth will be important to get
information at atomic scale. Hence, present work investigates these
aspects for MgO nanoparticles using XRD and NEXAFS.

2 Results
2.1 Lower and Upper Threshold of Thermal Treatment
for the Observation of Crystallization Growth
XRD patterns
of the precursor annealed at 300 °C for 1 h and 1200 °C
for 12 h reflect the change associated with thermal annealing (Figure S1). The XRD pattern at 300 °C for
1 h exhibits two major humps centered at 18° and 35°. There
is no other peak in this pattern, revealing the amorphous nature of
nanoparticles (Figure S1). When the precursor
is annealed at 1200 °C for 12 h, peaks at 36.44°, 44.38°,
62.42°, 74.88°, and 77.62° appear in the XRD pattern
(Figure S1). The presence of these peaks
in the XRD pattern is associated with the rocksalt phase of MgO (Figure S1). Refined structural parameters for
this material are collated in Table 1. The values of lattice parameter and crystallite size
are 4.2142 ± 0.0007 Å and ∼50 ± 2 nm, respectively
(Table 1). Lattice
constant is almost equal to that of bulk MgO.23,24 Thus, these observations reveal that crystallization occurs above
annealing of 300 °C. Hence, to understand the nature of grain
growth, the precursor was annealed at several temperatures ranging
from 350 to 1200 °C for 0.5 and 1 h. In order to see the effect
of annealing time on grain growth, the annealing time was also varied
from 0.5 to 12 h at annealing temperatures of 350 and 400 °C.
Thus, next two sections elaborate the grain growth under the influence
of annealing temperature and time.

Thus, thermal annealing of the precursor at 300 °C for 1 h
and 1200 °C for 12 h leads to significant changes in crystalline
nature; hence, significant modifications in the chemical nature of
these materials are expected. To answer this, NEXAFS measurements
for synthesized MgO materials, precursor, magnesium nitrate, and citric
acid were carried out. Figure 1 shows the Mg K-edge and O K-edge NEXAFS spectra of these
materials. Mg K-edge spectra of precursor and material having annealing
temperature at 300 °C for 1 h contain a spectral feature centered
on 1307.2 ± 0.1 eV. When the precursor is annealed to 1200 °C
for 12 h, spectral features A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5 centered at 1304.6
± 0.1, 1311.0 ± 0.1, 1322.2 ± 0.1, 1344.1 ± 0.1,
and 1357.9 ± 0.1 eV appear in the Mg K-edge spectrum, respectively.
The presence of these spectral features is associated with the formation
of MgO as observed from the Mg K-edge spectrum of the MgO crystal
(Figure S2). The origin of these spectral
features is described elsewhere.30−36 Moreover, spectral feature differences, δA1A2, δA1A3, and δA1A5, are estimated from Mg
K-edge in order to get information of crystallographic environment
of Mg2+ ions in synthesized materials. These values are
6.2 ± 0.2, 17.9 ± 0.2, and 46.2 ± 0.2 eV for materials
synthesized at 1200 °C for 12 h. Corresponding values for MgO
crystal are 6.3 ± 0.2, 18.0 ± 0.2, and 47.6 ± 0.2 eV
(Figure S2). Thus, values of δA1A2, δA1A3, and δA1A5 for this material
are almost similar to that of the MgO crystal. This envisages that
Mg2+ ion coordination in materials synthesized at 1200
°C for 12 h is analogues to that of the MgO crystal. These observations
are concurrent with the conclusions made from the XRD analysis.

Figure 1 NEXAFS measurements
at (a) Mg K-edge and (b) O K-edge for materials
synthesized at different annealing treatments along with precursor
and citric acid. Mg K-edge spectra of precursor and annealing temperature
of 300 °C is shown as inset a. Inset (b) shows the pre-edge region
of O K-edge spectra for these materials.

O K-edge spectra of precursor, citric acid along with materials
synthesized at 300 °C for 1 h and 1200 °C for 12 h, are
shown in Figure 1b.
The O K-edge spectrum of each material is different from each other,
revealing the significant change of local electronic owing to thermal
treatment. The O K-edge spectrum of the material synthesized at 1200
°C for 12 h contains spectral features B1, B2, B3, B4, and B5 centered at 538.2 ± 0.1, 540.8 ± 0.1, 547.2 ± 0.1,
552.6 ± 0.1, and 558.0 ± 0.1 eV in the post-edge region,
respectively, which are associated with the local electronic structure
similar to bulk (Figure S3). The presence
of these spectral features is due to O–Mg and Mg–Mg
interactions in the MgO. The origin of these spectral features is
discussed in details by Mizoguchi et al. (2001).36

The pre-edge region of the spectrum of this material
contains one
spectral feature, Bo, centered at 534.8
± 0.1 eV (inset: Figure 1b). The pre-edge region of this spectrum for citric acid exhibits
spectral features, B and Bo′, centered at 532.6 ± 0.1 and 534.9 ± 0.1 eV (inset: Figure 1b), respectively.
Spectral features Bo′ and Bo (minor) centered at 533.5 ± 0.1 and 535.0
± 0.1 eV, respectively, occur in the pre-edge region of spectra
for precursor and material synthesized at 300 °C. Thus, pre-edge
regions of these spectra exhibit systematical changes from starting
materials to its formation in the bulk state, that is, after synthesizing
at 1200 °C for 12 h (inset: Figure 1b). This envisages that bonds present in
the citric acid modify after annealing treatment. The O K-edge spectrum
of the MgO crystal does not exhibit any pre-edge structure (Figure S3). Hence, the presence of the pre-edge
region in the spectra of these materials may be ascribed to organic
templates.25,38

To get information of organic
impurities attached with crystallites,
NEXAFS spectra at C K- and N K-edges of these materials along with
citric acid and magnesium nitrate are being investigated (Figure 2). Citric acid which
is the matrix for synthesis exhibits spectral features around 284.2
± 0.1, 287.2 ± 0.1, and 291.6 ± 0.1 eV in the C K-edge
spectrum (Figure 2a).
These spectral features originate from carbon, C–O (surface)/C–H
bonds, and C–O (σ*).39,40 These spectral
features are termed as C1, S, and C2. The precursor obtained in the
synthesis process exhibits similar spectral features; however, the
shape of spectral features is slightly modified. Spectral feature C2 is broadened in the spectrum of the precursor.
Spectral feature, S, appears like a shoulder. When
the precursor is annealed to 300 °C, an additional spectral feature
centered at 290.8 ± 0.1 eV evolutes in the spectrum. This spectral
feature is denoted as C3 and associated
with the presence of C–C (σ*)-like bonds in these materials.41 This feature is also believed to have contribution
from C–N–C (π*) bonds.42 For materials synthesized at 1200 °C for 12 h, spectral feature C3 dominates. This envisages that carbon in the
form of C–C bonds/or C–N–C bonds still exist
at such long annealing durations.

Figure 2 (a) C K-edge and (b) N K-edges for materials
synthesized at 300
and 1200 °C for 12 h along with precursor, citric acid, and magnesium
nitrate.

Further, to elucidate the presence
of nitrogen ions, N K-edge spectra
for synthesized materials measured along with magnesium nitrate and
precursor are shown in Figure 2b. Magnesium nitrate, which is the starting material for synthesizing
materials, contains two dominant spectral features D and D′ centered at 401.6 ± 0.1 and
405.1 ± 0.1 eV, respectively. Spectral feature, D′, is due to 1s−π* transition of nitrate anion;43 however, minor spectral feature, D, envisages the presence of nitride anions.44 In addition to these spectral features, a shoulder-like feature
around 400.2 ± 0.1 eV also exists in the spectrum of magnesium
nitrate. This shoulder is denoted as D1 and is associated with amino-type species in the starting materials.45,46 The N K-edge spectrum of the precursor formed during synthesis process
exhibits spectral features D1 and D2. Spectral feature, D2, envisages the existence of N–O and nitrided carbon
in the precursor.45−47 Spectral features, D1 and D2, exist in the N K-edge spectrum
even if the precursor is annealed at 300 °C. Spectral feature, D2, almost disappears for bulk treatment; however,
the intensity of spectral feature, D1,
improves significantly. Thus, nitrogen in the form of amino-type species
exists in the material synthesized at 1200 °C for 12 h. Hence,
these investigations envisage the existence of organic impurities
in the form of nitric carbon and amino-type nitrogen along with crystallite/grain
in synthesized materials.

2.2 Variation of Annealing
Temperature
In order to investigate grain growth with annealing
temperature,
the precursor was annealed at several temperature ranging from 350
to 1200 °C for 0.5 and 1 h. Refined XRD patterns at 350, 400,
600, 800, 1000, and 1200 °C for 0.5 and 1 h are shown in Figure S4. Both the experimental and refined
XRD patterns are in close agreement with each other for all nanoparticles.
This indicates that annealing at these temperatures for durations
of 0.5 and 1 h forms the pure rocksalt phase of MgO. The values of
lattice parameter decrease with annealing temperature at both annealing
durations (Table S1). At annealing temperature
of 1200 °C for both annealing durations, values of lattice parameter
are close to that of bulk MgO (4.214 Å). This reveals that crystallinity
improves with the increase of annealing temperatures. XRD peaks get
narrowed with the increase of annealing temperature, indicating enhancement
of crystallite size with annealing (Figure S4). Values of crystallite size are 8.2 ± 0.2, 10.7 ± 0.3,
12.6 ± 0.4, 20.4 ± 0.9, 26.2 ± 1.5, and 31.8 ±
2.3 nm for annealing temperatures of 350, 400, 600, 800, 1000, and
1200 °C for 0.5 h (Figure S5), respectively.
These values are 6.9 ± 0.2, 11.8 ± 0.4, 15.8 ± 0.5,
21.6 ± 1.1, 26.6 ± 1.6, and 32.9 ± 1.5 nm for corresponding
temperatures at 1 h (Figure S5). Considering,
annealing temperature to be denoted by “T”
variation of crystallite size, D, with temperature
can be given by following empirical equations 1   2  

Thus, variation of crystallite size
with annealing temperature is described by empirical linear equations
at both annealing durations. Hence, these empirical equations reveal
the nature of crystallization growth with annealing temperature. It
is clear from these equations that annealing temperature promotes
grain growth in the nanomaterials. This behavior is reflected by the
number of nanoparticle systems including ferrites,48,49 oxides,50,51 and titanates52 synthesized using same method.

To get understanding of local
electronic/atomic order modifications
with annealing temperature, measured Mg K-edge spectra at various
annealing temperatures for 0.5 and 1 h are shown in Figure S6. The presence of spectral features A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5 clearly reveals local electronic structure analogues to MgO
for both annealing durations (Figure S6).

To get deeper insights of Mg2+ ion coordination,
the
behavior of δA1A2, δA1A3, and δA1A5 is depicted in Figure 3. Values of δA1A2 increase exponentially with annealing temperature
from 5.6 ± 0.2 to 6.3 ± 0.2 eV for annealing time of 0.5
h (Figure 3a). Similar
variation is observed for δA1A3 as this value increases from 16.7 ± 0.2
to 17.8 ± 0.2 eV as the annealing temperature increases from
350 to 1200 °C at this annealing time (Figure 3a). δA1A5 increases linearly with annealing
temperature from 46.4 ± 0.2 to 47.0 ± 0.2 eV at this annealing
time (Figure 3a). At
1200 °C and 0.5 h, values of δA1A2, δA1A3, and δA1A5 are 6.3 ± 0.2, 17.8 ±
0.2, and 47.0 ± 0.2 eV which are close to the value of bulk MgO
(Figure S2), respectively. This reveals
the existence of Mg2+ ions in crystallographic environment
similar to bulk MgO under this annealing condition.

Figure 3 Variation of Mg K-edge
spectral feature energy difference (ΔE) with
annealing temperature for annealing duration of
(a) 0.5 and (b) 1 h. δA1A2, δA1A3, and δA1A5 are the energy differences of Mg K-edge
spectral features A1, A2, A3, and A5.

The values of δA1A2, δA1A3, and δA1A5 are 4.7 ±
0.2, 14.2 ± 0.2, and 45.6 ±
0.2 eV at 350 °C for 1 h (Figure 3b) which are significantly less than the values of
bulk MgO (Figure S2), respectively. This
envisages the presence of distorted coordination of Mg2+ ions in these nanoparticles. On further increasing the annealing
temperature, these values remain almost constant within experimental
error at values of 5.9 ± 0.2, 17.2 ± 0.2, and 46.4 ±
0.2 eV (Figure 3b).
For nanoparticles synthesized at 350 °C, Values of δA1A2, δA1A3, and δA1A5 at 1 h (Figure 3b) are slightly less
than that observed for 0.5 h (Figure 3a). This reveals that Mg2+ ion coordination
is slightly distorted. During synthesis, the precursor was annealed
first for 1 h. It took around 6–7 days to synthesize these
nanoparticles. Then, after 6–7 days, the precursor was annealed
for 0.5 h at different temperatures. It is possible that during this
period, self-induced growth takes place and after annealing, the crystallites
become more ordered.

Figure 4 shows the
O K-edge NEXAFS spectra of nanoparticles synthesized at 350, 400,
600, 800, 1000, and 1200 °C for annealing time of 0.5 and 1 h.
The pre-edge region is also shown as the inset in these figures for
better visualization. Spectral features B1, B2, B3, B4, and B5 appear
at 537.4 ± 0.1, 540.8 ± 0.1, 547.8 ± 0.1, 553.2 ±
0.1, and 558.2 ± 0.1 eV, respectively, for nanoparticles synthesized
at 600, 800, 1000, and 1200 °C for 0.5 h (Figure 4a).

Figure 4 O K-edge spectra and pre-edge region (inset)
for various annealing
temperatures at annealing times of (a) 0.5 and (b) 1 h.

These post-edge spectral features are distinguishable
in all nanoparticles.
At 350 and 400 °C, spectral feature, B4, almost disappears. Moreover, the intensity of spectral feature, B3, for these nanoparticles is low. Behavior
of post-edge region is more interesting. The spectral features B1, B2, B3, B4, and B5 appear at 537.4 ± 0.1, 540.8 ± 0.1, 547.8
± 0.1, 553.2 ± 0.1, and 558.2 ± 0.1 eV, respectively,
for nanoparticles synthesized at 600, 800, 1000, and 1200 °C
for 1 h (Figure 4b). Figure 5 shows the C K-edge
spectra of these nanoparticles grown at several temperatures for 0.5
and 1 h. Spectral features C1, C2, and C3 appear
at 284.2 ± 0.1, 288.4 ± 0.1, and 290.3 ± 0.1, respectively,
in the C K-edge spectra of materials synthesized at different annealing
temperatures for 0.5 h (Figure 5a), respectively. A shoulder, S, around 287.4
± 0.1 eV also appears in the spectra of these materials. Appearance
of these spectral features at various annealing temperatures is associated
with quinine-type carbon, C–O (surface)/C–H bonds, C–O
(σ*), and C–C (σ*)/C–N–C (π*)
bonds.39−42 For annealing time of 1 h, the presence of the features C1, S, C2, and C3 in the spectra of materials
synthesized at different annealing temperatures reveal existence of
these bonds in these materials (Figure 5b). Spectral features, D1 and D2, present in all of the nanoparticles
irrespective of annealing temperature (Figure S7) which envisages the presence of amino, N–O, and
nitride carbon-type species in these materials.45−47 We further
investigated the effect of annealing time on the growth of MgO nanoparticles
and discussed in next section.

Figure 5 C K-edge spectra and pre-edge spectral
feature at various annealing
temperatures for annealing times of (a) 0.5 and (b) 1 h.

2.3 Variation of Annealing
Time
A further
attempt was made to investigate the grain growth with annealing time;
the precursor was annealed at 350 and 400 °C for 0.5, 1, 3, 6,
9, and 12 h. Refined XRD patterns for various annealing times reveal
the formation of rocksalt phase in these nanoparticles (Figure S8). Refined parameters are collated in Table S2. The values of lattice parameter decrease
slightly within experimental error at annealing times at 350 and 400
°C (Table S2). At both temperatures
and various annealing durations, the value of lattice parameter is
around 4.225 Å (Table S2). This reveals
that longer annealing does not play significant role to improve crystallinity
of materials. Variations of crystallite size with annealing time at
annealing temperatures of 350 and 400 °C are shown in Figure S9. Values of crystallite size are 8.2
± 0.2, 6.9 ± 0.2, 9.0 ± 0.4, 11.1 ± 0.4, 9.3 ±
0.4, and 9.7 ± 0.4 nm for 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 h for an annealing
temperature of 350 °C, respectively. These values are 10.7 ±
0.2, 10.9 ± 0.3, 11.3 ± 0.3, 10.9 ± 0.3, 11.0 ±
0.3, and 11.0 ± 3 nm at corresponding temperatures for 1 h. At
400 °C, values of crystallite size are 10.7 ± 0.3, 10.9
± 0.3, 11.2 ± 0.3, 10.9 ± 0.3, 10.9 ± 0.3, and
11.0 ± 0.3 nm for annealing durations of 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 9, and
12 h. Variation of crystallite size with
annealing temperature is better represented by a linear fitting for
both annealing durations (Figure S9). Considering
annealing time by “t”, fitting can
be represented as 3   4  when annealing temperature is 350 °C,
the value of slope is 0.36 ± 0.02 s–1; however,
this value is 0.01 ± 0.02 s–1 for annealing
temperature of 400 °C. This reveals that annealing time promotes
crystallization at 350 °C; however, the role of annealing duration
is almost nonsignificant on crystallite growth at 400 °C. Because
with the increase of annealing duration, heat confinement will increase
inside the crystallites; hence, investigation for determining local
electronic structure at these durations is also performed.

Mg
K-edge spectra for various annealing times at 350 and 400 °C
are shown in Figure S10. The presence of
spectral features, A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5 for all annealing durations
clearly reveals the presence of local electronic structure similar
to bulk MgO at 350 and 400 °C; however, variations of δA1A2, δA1A3, and δA1A5 with annealing
times reflect modification of Mg2+ ion coordination (Figure 6). Values of δA1A2 are 5.6 ±
0.2, 4.7 ± 0.2, 5.8 ± 0.2, 5.9 ± 0.2, 5.7 ± 0.2,
and 5.7 ± 0.2 eV for annealing durations of 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 9,
and 12 h at 350 °C (Figure 6a). δA1A3 values are 16.7
± 0.2, 14.1 ± 0.2, 16.9 ± 0.2, 17.2 ± 0.2, 17.1
± 0.2, and 17.0 ± 0.2 eV for corresponding annealing time.
Variation of δA1A5 is analogues to δA1A2 and δA1A3 as can be seem from Figure 6a. δA1A5 values are 46.4
± 0.2, 33.9 ± 3.1, 46.3 ± 0.2, 46.5 ± 0.5, 46.3
± 0.2, and 46.2 ± 0.2 eV for annealing durations of 0.5,
1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 h, respectively (Figure 6a). Thus, these values are maximum at annealing
duration of 6 h and always less than the values of these parameters
for bulk MgO (Figure S1). This reveals
that annealing duration at such low annealing temperature does not
improve the Mg2+ ion coordination even if it is increased
to 12 h.

Figure 6 Variations of Mg K-edge spectral feature energy difference (ΔE) with annealing duration for annealing temperature of
(a) 350 and (b) 400 °C.

We further focus our attention to understand the behavior
of Mg2+ ion coordination under annealing temperature of
400 °C.
The parameters δA1A2, δA1A3, and δA1A5 at various annealing times are shown in Figure 6b.

Figure 6b reflects
that variation of these three parameters with annealing time is different
from each other. The δA1A2 values are 5.9 ± 0.2, 5.9 ± 0.2,
6.1 ± 0.2, 5.9 ± 0.2, 5.6 ± 0.2, and 5.7 ± 0.2
eV for annealing durations of 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 h, respectively.
These values are almost similar for annealing duration up to 6 h.
However, values reduce significantly for annealing durations of 9
and 12 h. This reveals pertinent of bulk-like coordination up to 6
h; however, it deteriorates slightly at higher annealing duration.
Values of δA1A3 increase slightly from 17.3 ± 0.2 to 17.7 ± 0.2
eV as annealing duration increases from 0.5 to 12 h. These parameters
also lower than that of bulk MgO. Figure 6b also envisages that δA1A5 too lower than that of
the corresponding value for bulk MgO (Figure S2). The value of this parameter decreases slightly from 46.4 ±
0.2 to 46.1 ± 0.2 eV for the increase of annealing duration from
0.5 to 12 h. Thus, behavior of these parameters reveals slight modification
of Mg2+ ion coordination with annealing time. It is clear
from the behavior of these parameters that mere increase of annealing
duration does not form the perfect coordination but annealing temperature
plays important role. Increase of annealing temperature induces crystallization
growth as discussed in the previous section.

Figure 7 shows the
O K-edge NEXAFS spectra of nanoparticles synthesized at 0.5, 1, 3,
6, 9, and 12 h for annealing temperature of 350 and 400 °C. The
pre-edge region is also shown as the inset in this figure for better
visualization. The spectral features B1, B2, B3, B4, and B5 appear
at 537.4 ± 0.1, 540.8 ± 0.1, 547.8 ± 0.1, 553.2 ±
0.1, and 558.2 ± 0.1 eV, respectively, for nanoparticles synthesized
at annealing times of 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 h (Figure 7a). These post-edge spectral
features are distinguishable in all nanoparticles. At lower annealing
times for both annealing temperature, that is, 350 and 400 °C,
spectral feature, B4, almost disappears.
Moreover, the intensity of spectral feature, B3, for these nanoparticles is low. Behavior of post-edge region
is more interesting. The spectral features B1, B2, B3, B4, and B5 appear at 537.4 ± 0.1, 540.8 ± 0.1, 547.8 ± 0.1,
553.2 ± 0.1, and 558.2 ± 0.1 eV for nanoparticles synthesized
at annealing times of 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 h (Figure 7b). Spectral features, Bo and Bo′,
in the pre-edge region exhibit systematic variation of intensity with
annealing durations at both annealing temperatures. In both cases,
spectral feature, Bo′, disappears
at higher annealing temperatures. Again, it is clear from Figure S4 that these pre-edge structures are
not characteristics of MgO and are associated with organic templates
attached with crystallites. Nature of these templates is investigated
from the C K and N K-edge NEXAFS measurements.

Figure 7 O K-edge spectra and
pre-edge region (inset) for various annealing
durations at annealing temperatures of (a) 350 and (b) 400 °C.

Figure 8 shows the
C K-edge spectra of these nanoparticles grown at several annealing
durations for annealing temperature of 0.5 and 1 h. Spectral features C1, C2, and C3 appears at 284.2 ± 0.1, 288.4 ±
0.1, and 290.3 ± 0.1 eV in the C K-edge spectra of materials
synthesized at different annealing times for annealing temperature
of 350 °C (Figure 8a). A shoulder, S, around 287.4 ± 0.1 eV also
appears in the spectra of these nanoparticles. Appearance of these
spectral features at various annealing temperatures is associated
with quinine-type carbon, C–O (surface)/C–H bonds, C–O
(σ*), and C–C (σ*)/C–N–C (π*)
bonds.38−41 For annealing temperature of 400 °C, the presence of the features C1, S, C2, and C3 in the spectra of nanoparticles
synthesized at different annealing times reveals existence of these
bonds (Figure 8b).

Figure 8 C K-edge
spectra for various annealing durations at annealing temperatures
of (a) 350 and (b) 400 °C.

Spectral features D1 and D2 appear in the N K-edge spectra of all of the
nanoparticles
irrespective of annealing time (Figure S11) which envisages the presence of amino, N–O and N–O,
and nitride carbon-type species.45−47 Similar investigations
were also observed from the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic
investigation of zinc ferrite nanoparticles synthesized using similar
methods.53 These impurities are always
attached with nanoparticles and cannot be removed even if these nanoparticles
are kept under intense beam of heavy ions.53,54 High-temperature annealing to chemically synthesize nanoparticles
also shows onsets of carboneous-like impurities.55 Even washing of nanoparticles synthesized using chemical
methods is not able to give these nanoparticles free from organic
impurities.56 Thus, the presence of these
impurities may lead to high dielectric and magnetic loss in the materials
synthesized using these methods even having modified dielectric,57 optical, and magnetic behavior.25,58 Thus, attachment of these carbon-like impurities with crystallites
is intrinsic properties of chemically synthesized materials. This
aspect is also investigated by FTIR spectroscopy for magnesium oxides
and calcium oxide nanoparticles.38

3 Discussion
Further, the role of thermal annealing on
the crystallization growth
can be understood by following equation which relates Gibbs energy
to the thermal energy.59,60 5  

The grain growth can be described for specific annealing duration
can be given as 6  where D is the final
grain
size and Do is the initial grain size. ko is a constant, TK is the absolute temperature, and Q is the activation
energy for grain boundary mobility. t is the time
required to reach the given grain size.61 Activation energy for grain boundary mobility was calculated from
the linear fitting ln(D2 – Do2) versus 1/TK curves which are shown in Figure 9. The detailed description is described in
S1 (Supporting Information). The activation
energies for grain boundary mobility are 0.24 ± 0.02 and 0.025
± 0.03 eV nm2/mol for annealing times of 0.5 and 1
h, respectively. Thus, the value of activation energy is equivalent
for both annealing durations.

Figure 9 Linear fittings of ln(D2) versus kT for estimation of activation
energy of grain boundary
mobility.

Thus, the nanoparticle system
grown using chemical methods can
be better described by a mixture of organic template and inorganic
crystallites. Similar findings are also being observed from combined
investigation of EDX, NEXAFS, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
for selected MgO nanoparticles and published elsewhere.58 XRD measurements which depend on the crystallinity
detect only the crystal. However, when these nanoparticles are detected
using NEXAFS which depends on the atomic nature, a significant change
is observed in NEXAFS measurements especially at C and N K-edge. Thus,
it is stated that organic templates are pertinent with crystallite
and seems to be independent from thermal treatment.

Figure 10 Mg K-edge spectra of
nanoparticles for various annealing times
at annealing temperatures of (a) 350, (b) 600, and (c) 1200 °C.

To establish the fact again, NEXAFS
measurements in bulk sensitive,
total fluorescence yield (TFY) mode were performed for selected nanoparticles
at Mg and O K-edges. TEY mode spectra were also measured along with
TFY measurements. TEY & TFY measurements reflect same nature for
corresponding nanoparticles (Figure 10). To get deeper insights of this effect, difference
and ratio of spectral features A1 and A2 in TEY and TFY mode are estimated. These values
are collated in Table S3. It is clear that
these values are comparable except the nanoparticle synthesized at
350 °C for 9 h. This effect is associated with the presence of
minor phase of magnesium hydroxide phase at such treatment (Figure S13).62 Moreover,
O K-edge spectra also exhibit same kind of behavior at surface and
bulk of the nanoparticles (Figure S12).
This again supports the association of carboneous impurities attached
with crystallites. If compared from previous work of our group,53−57 then it is observed that O K-edge spectra, in comparison of Mg K-edge,
are more sensitive to organic templates in the case of MgO nanoparticles.25,58 These spectra seem to be insensitive to these templates in the case
of nanoparticles such as CaO, ZnFe2O4, MgFe2O4, CoFe2O4, and ZnO when
synthesized using chemical methods. It is observed that cross section
of O–Mg and O–C interaction is comparable. However,
cross section of O–C interaction is not significant in the
case of other oxides.53−57,59 Thus, these measurements revealed
that Mg2+ ion coordination is modulated by annealing temperature
and time along with the crystallite growth. Organic-like species are
always attached to the crystallites when grown using chemical methods.
Moreover, control of these species during synthesis is very tedious;
hence, variation of O K-edge spectra either with annealing time or
temperature is not as systematic as Mg K-edge.

4 Conclusions
Thus, the present work investigates the effect of annealing treatment
on the crystallization growth of MgO nanoparticles by means of XRD
and NEXAFS fine structure measurements. The precursor obtained in
this method is amorphous in nature and exhibits onset of organic impurities
as observed from NEXAFS measurements. When annealing is performed
at 300 °C, amorphous phase along with several organic impurities
occurred. XRD studies reveal that crystallization occurs above 300
°C. Values of crystallite size increases linearly with annealing
temperature. Thus, enhancement of annealing temperature promotes grain
growth. The organic impurities are attached to these crystallites
at several annealing temperatures. When annealing duration is increased,
nonsignificant growth of crystallite occurs with no de-attachment
of organic impurities. At lower annealing time, Mg2+ ion
coordination improves with the increase of annealing temperature;
however, there is negligible modification of coordination for annealing
time of 1 h. At lower annealing temperature, Mg2+ ion coordination
first improves, then weaken slightly with annealing duration. At other
annealing temperature, Mg2+ ion coordination weakens with
the increase of annealing time.

5 Experimental
Section
5.1 Synthesis of Nanoparticles
Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (AR Grade) was mixed into
citric acid solution by keeping cations to citric acid ratio as 1:3.
The mixture was placed on a magnetic stirrer at 90 °C for almost
6 h. Thus, the obtained viscous solution was heated at 100 °C
for 16 h. The precursor formed after heating was annealed at various
temperatures ranging from 300 to 1200 °C for 0.5 and 1 h. The
precursor was also annealed at 350 and 400 °C by varying annealing
durations ranging from 0.5 to 12 h for investigation of annealing
time influence on nanoparticle growth. One material was obtained by
annealing precursor at 1200 °C at 12 h which is termed as bulk
in this investigation. The detailed procedure of thermal treatment
for obtaining MgO nanoparticles is depicted in Figure S14.

5.2 Characterization of Nanoparticles
XRD patterns were recorded on a D/MAX2500 (RIGAKU, Japan) X-ray
diffractometer
by using Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å) radiation. NEXAFS measurements
on these nanoparticles were carried out at 10D XAS-KIST beamlines.32,33

5.3 Analysis/Simulation Details
The obtained
XRD patterns were refined using Fullprof programme.37 The crystallite size (D) of these nanoparticles
was estimated from the most intense peak using Scherrer’s formula.
NEXAFS spectra at Mg and O K-edges are normalized by removing pre-edge
and post-edge backgrounds, resulting in intensity = 0 and 1 for pre-edge
and post-edge backgrounds, respectively. Such routine could be not
followed for spectra measured at C and N K-edges because of weak signal;
thereby, the intensity is the relative intensity.
