Currently, antibodies are widely
used not only in research but
also in therapy. Hence, peptides that selectively bind to the fragment
crystallizable site of an antibody have been extensively utilized
in various research efforts such as the preparation of antibody–drug
conjugates (ADC). Consequently, appropriate peptides that bind to
immunoglobulin G (IgG) with a specific Kd value and also kon and koff values will be useful in different applications, and
these kinetic parameters have been perhaps overlooked but are key
to development of peptide ligands with advantageous binding properties.
We prepared structural derivatives of IgG-binding peptide 1 and evaluated the binding affinity and kinetic rates of the products
by surface plasmon resonance assay and isothermal titration calorimetry
to obtain novel peptides with beneficial antibody binding properties.
In this way, 15-Lys8Leu with fast-binding and slow-release
features was obtained through a shortened peptide 15-IgBP. On the
other hand, we successfully obtained distinctive peptide, 15-Lys8Tle, with a similar Kd value but with kon and koff values
that were as much as six-fold different from those of 15-IgBP. These
new peptides are useful for the elucidation of kinetic effects on
the function of IgG-binding peptides and various applications of antibody
or antibody–drug interactions, such as immunoliposome, ADC,
or half-life extension strategy, by using a peptide with the appropriate
kinetic features.

==== Body
Introduction
Antibodies exhibit
high target specificity and produce beneficial
functions such as target neutralization and antibody-dependent cellular
cytotoxicity in the immune system.1,2 Consequently,
antibodies are utilized not only as research tools in immunology,
biology, and chemistry but also as therapeutic agents to fight serious
diseases. One of the most promising applications of antibodies is
antibody–drug conjugates (ADC) which are expected to be a key
to next-generation drugs, particularly for anticancer therapy. The
ADC can efficiently deliver a strong antitumor drug to the target
tumor tissue with diminished toxicity to noncancerous tissues. Some
ADCs have already been clinically approved, and currently, more than
fifty kinds of ADCs are in clinical trials worldwide.3 In connection with this movement, selective conjugation
of payloads to antibodies has recently become an important aspect
of the development of high-quality ADCs.

One of the versatile
approaches to the selective conjugation of
the payload is the use of a peptide that selectively binds to the
fragment crystallizable (Fc) region of an antibody,4−6 the tail region
of an antibody that interacts with cell surface receptors called Fc
receptors. To date, several IgG-binding peptides have been reported
(Figure 1)7,8 and are represented by the Z33 peptide which was derived in 1996
from the B-domain of protein A by the phage display method.9 This peptide which consists of 33 amino acid
residues shows strong binding affinity (Kd = 43 nM)9 to the human immunoglobulin
G1 (IgG1). In 2000, Wells et al. discovered
a shorter monocyclic IgG-binding peptide Fc-III with 13 amino acids
(Kd = 185 nM)10 from peptide screening based on a phage display method.11 Ito et al. independently reported similar IgG-binding
disulfide peptides 1(4) and 2(12) (17 aa) with Kd values of 225 and 10 nM, respectively, and other groups
reported two more potent peptide derivatives, FcBP-210 (Kd = 2.2) and Fc-III-4C13 (Kd = 2.45 nM),
which were obtained by bicyclization of the aforementioned monocyclic
Fc-III peptide to maintain the peptide backbone in the β-sheet-like
structure observed in the original Fc-III. A second cyclization of
FcBP-2 was accomplished by amide bond formation between both C- and
N-terminals with an additional D-Pro-L-Pro sequence.10 On the other hand, in Fc-III-4C,13 the similar second cyclization was accomplished by disulfide bond
formation between two Cys residues introduced at each terminal. Although
these bicyclic peptides showed potent binding affinity, subsequent
or detailed structure activity relationship (SAR) studies have not
been reported so far, probably due to the difficulties in the chemical
synthesis of these peptides with a bicyclic scaffold.

of IgG-binding peptides. The lower-case “p”
in the sequence of FcBP-2 indicates the d-proline residue.

To date, IgG-binding peptides (Figure 1) have been studied for a variety
of applications
by several research groups. An example is the preparation of ADC with
the covalent conjugation reaction. In particular, IgG-binding peptides
such as the Z3314 or Fc-III peptide5,15 contain a chemically or photochemically reactive group which can
form a covalent bond with an antibody to enable the selective modification
of the antibody. Based on this concept, our group developed a new
method for antibody modification using peptide 1, referred
to as the chemical conjugation by the affinity peptide (CCAP) method.4 In this method, the side chain of Lys8 of peptide 1 is first reacted with a succinimidyl ester of a bivalent
cross-linker, disuccinimidyl glutarate, to prepare a peptide which
can tether a second succinimidyl ester. The reactive ester on the
peptide then makes an amide bond with the amino groups on the surface
of the antibody, resulting in covalent bonding of the peptide to the
antibody. The conjugation reaction occurs near the peptide binding
site (i.e., the Fc-site), which allows the Fab-site to remain intact.
Thus, these peptides, particularly if connected to a payload, can
be applied to construct a homogeneous ADC.

In addition to covalent
ADC preparation, IgG-binding peptides have
been applied to a noncovalent method. For example, Ohata and Ball
reported an Fc-binding peptide metalated with rhodium, which provided
a catalytic chemical modification of an antibody via a rhodium-catalyzed
reaction.6 Moreover, the IgG-binding peptide
was utilized as an antibody capturing unit in affinity chromatography
replacing protein A, which is commonly used.12 In the other example, concerning the preparation of immunoliposome,
the IgG-binding peptide was loaded onto liposome-recruited antibodies
on the surface of liposomes for selective drug delivery.16 It has also been reported that, based on the
interaction of the IgG binding peptide with endogenous antibodies,
conjugates of the peptide to a small drug molecule or therapeutic
peptide/protein are applicable to the noncovalent-type ADC strategy17 or an in vivo half-life extension strategy for
rapidly biodegradable drugs.18

In
the development of appropriate IgG-binding peptides, the dissociation
constant (Kd) is generally measured in
order to evaluate the binding affinity to the antibody. However, peptides
with the same Kd value do not always show
the same kinetic properties because this value is from a ratio between
the association rate constant (kon) and
dissociation rate constant (koff). Consequently,
appropriate IgG-binding peptides with a specific kinetic property
would be required for different applications. For example, when IgG-binding
peptides covalently conjugate with antibodies, it may be preferable
that the peptides have a higher kon value
relative to the koff value, because of
the absence of a dissociation step after the covalent-bond forming
reaction. Alternatively, when IgG-binding peptides containing catalysts
induced the conjugation reaction between payload and antibody as previously
cited,6 it may be preferable for the peptides
to have a higher koff value because the
catalyst requires prompt release from the antibody after the reaction
to interact with another target molecule, resulting in an enhanced
catalytic cycle. IgG-binding peptides appropriate for preparing the
immune-liposome,16 noncovalent-type ADC,17 or half-life extension conjugate18 are better if they have a slow dissociation
rate, that is, a low koff value that leads
to the suppression of their undesired dissociation from antibodies
in circulating blood.

In recent interpretations of the Kd value in medicinal chemistry, kon and koff values are beginning
to be acknowledged
as more important factors.19,20 Though kon and koff values of IgG-binding
peptides are essential information for a wide variety of their applications,
this question has been rarely studied so far. Hence, in the present
study, we performed a series of SAR studies of human IgG-binding peptide 1, which is used in the CCAP method,4 in order to understand the structural influence on Kd, kon, and koff values, and we found peptides possessing a stronger
binding ability than the original peptide (1) and peptides
with a similar Kd value but different
binding properties, such as fast-binding/fast-release and slow-binding/slow-release.

Results
and Discussion
Alanine Scanning Study of IgG-Binding Peptide 1
Derivatives of the IgG-binding peptide (1)
were synthesized by a general Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl)-based
solid-phase peptide synthesis method21 and
applied to physicochemical evaluation with >95% purity (see the Experimental Section for more details).

Alanine
scanning of peptide 1 was first performed to identify
the structural requirements for the potent binding activity in each
residue, except Ala5 and Cys4/Cys14, which were required for the intramolecular
disulfide bridge. We synthesized 14 peptides, and their binding kinetics
(Kd, kon,
and koff) to an antibody (Herceptin) were
measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay using a 1:1 Langmuir
fit model or steady-state analysis (fitting curves of representative
peptides are shown in the Supporting Information in Figure S1). As shown in Table 1, peptides Gly1Ala and Pro2Ala retained the binding affinity (Kd =
248 and 314 nM, respectively) compared to original peptide 1 (Kd = 225 nM). This result suggested
that the amino acid residues at the N-terminus (Gly1 and Pro2) were
irrelevant to the potent antibody binding. On the other hand, Ala-substitution
at Tyr6, His7, Leu11, Val12, and Trp13 led to a complete loss of binding
affinity, indicating that these residues are crucial for the antibody
binding. All these critical residues are located inside the cyclic
structure and are divided into two regions: Tyr6-His7 and Leu11-Trp13,
which are designated as minor and major regions, respectively (the
residues were highlighted with blue color in the peptide sequence
depicted in Table 1). While substitutions at Asp3, Gly9, Glu10, Thr15, Phe16, and His17
to Ala resulted in a 2- to 8-fold lower affinity (Kd = 762, 1720, 448, 622, 950, and 696 nM, respectively), Lys8Ala alone showed a slightly stronger affinity (Kd = 171 nM) than the original peptide (1). In contrast to a large change observed in Kd values (171–1720 nM), the kon values changed only minimally from 0.582 to 0.909 s–1·μM–1 except in the case
of Gly9Ala. Gly9Ala with kon = 0.252 s–1·μM–1 shows a 3.6-times lower kon value than
the original peptide (1), suggesting that the introduction
of a small methyl group to Gly9 has a significant negative effect
on the peptide binding to the antibody, resulting in a high Kd value of 1720 nM. In comparison to original
peptide 1, Lys8Ala showed a slower releasing
step (lower koff value) that is enough
to compensate for the slower binding step (lower kon value), resulting in the most potent binding affinity
of Lys8Ala in this alanine scanning study.

c Steady-state analysis was applied
because of the low reliability of a fitting curve (U-value > 14). Data are presented as mean ± SE (n = 5). The important residues are indicated with blue color in the
peptide sequence (see the second paragraph of Results
and Discussion).

Next, the effects of a series of Ala substitutions on the secondary
structure were evaluated by circular dichroism (CD) spectrometry.
This is a first report of the CD spectrum analysis of the series of
peptides, but the phenomenon has been already observed by NMR10 and X-ray cocrystal structure11 analysis showing that the peptides show a β-sheet-like
structure involving a β-bulge, which is a twisted secondary
structure in the β-strand sometimes observed in the protein.
However, as shown in Figure 2, CD analysis indicated that peptide 1 displays
a random coil-like structure with a random coil content of 62% determined
on the basis of Reed’s ref (22). This discrepancy could probably be attributed
to the lack of spectral information of β-bulge because of the
nonrepetitive feature of the β-bulge structure23 and low frequency in peptides or proteins. In addition,
there is a twisted β-bulge structure between Val12 and Trp13,
residues which are involved in the major region covered in the Ala
scanning. For these reasons, the secondary structure of peptide 1 could be detected as a random coil in the CD spectral analysis.
CD spectra of other Ala-substituted peptides also indicated the similar
random coil-like structure with the random coil content ranging from
55 to 62%, regardless of the binding affinity (Figure 2 for four representative peptides, Figure S2 for other peptides). In the CD spectra
analysis (Figure 2),
we found that three peptides (peptide 1, Gly1Ala, and Pro2Ala) possessing a good binding affinity showed
a small maximal signal around 230 nm, while two other peptides (His7Ala and Val12Ala) possessing no significant
affinity did not. A similar correlation between the maximal signal
and binding affinity was also observed in the other peptides with
the exception of Leu11Ala and Gly9Ala (Figure S2). The maximal signal around 230 nm,
that is not considered in the secondary structure calculation of Reed’s
reference, is reported as a signal derived from a disulfide bond24,25 or π–π stacking.26 Although it is unclear what structure in the peptides is truly related
to the maximal signal observed around 230 nm, the signal in the CD
spectrum could indicate a conformation which is intimately related
to the binding affinity.

of the maximal signal at 230 nm that is detected in the spectrum of
peptide 1, Gly1Ala, and Pro2Ala but not in the spectrum of His7Ala and Val12Ala.

Truncation Study of IgG-Binding
Peptide 1
We next performed a study of truncation
from both N- and C-termini
of peptide 1 in an effort to identify the minimum sequence
required for IgG binding (Table 2). As suggested in Ala-scanning, peptide 1 (3–17) with Gly1 and Pro2 deletion retained
the beneficial binding affinity (Kd =
267 nM) compared to original peptide 1, suggesting again
that the two N-terminal residues are not necessary for binding. Contrary
to this, peptide 1 (4–17) with deletion
of Gly1–Asp3 residues showed a dramatically higher Kd value of 1470 nM. The koff value of the peptide was markedly decreased to 1.05 s–1 from 0.204 s–1 in peptide 1, while the kon value (0.716
s–1·μM–1) retained
that observed in peptide 1 (0.909 s–1·μM–1), suggesting that Asp3, which
is located at the outside of the cyclic structure, contributes significantly
to the dissociation step. Therefore, the minimum sequence for the
activity required at the N-terminus begins at Asp3.

c n.b.: no detectable binding.

Otherwise, C-terminal deletion led a stepwise decrease of the IgG
binding affinity The Kd values of peptide 1, peptide 1 (1–16), and
peptide 1 (1–15) were 225, 703, and
1640 nM, respectively, and peptide 1 (1–14) showed no detectable binding, and there was a similar gradual decrease
in both the kon and koff values. These results suggest that C-terminal residues
are valuable in maintaining the potent binding activity. The previously
reported IgG-binding peptides Fc-III and the bicyclized peptides10,13 (Figure 1) lack the
residues corresponding to Phe16 and His17 in peptide 1 as an interaction site to the antibody, and the effect of these
residues on the affinity was not previously discussed. Our finding
is therefore the first report of the importance of the two C-terminal
residues. Taking these results into account, we concluded that peptide 1 (3–17) designated as 15-IgBP, and comprised
15 amino acid residues from the C-terminus of peptide 1, is a minimum sequence required for strong IgG-binding affinity.
Therefore, 15-IgBP was used as a lead peptide with the monocyclic
scaffold in further SAR studies.

Additionally, the peptide 1 (3–15) which involves almost the same
amino acid sequence as that of Fc-III
(13 aa, Kd = 185 nM10), except for N-terminal acetylation and/or substitutions
of Lys8Leu and Tyr13Trp, did not show any significant binding affinity
to the antibody (Kd > 2000 nM, Table 2). This indicates
that the structural differences between Fc-III and peptide 1 (3–15) significantly influence the binding affinity.

Amino Acid Substitution at Position 8 of 15-IgBP
For
further structural optimization starting with 15-IgBP, we focused
on the Lys residue at position 8 because substitution at only this
position improved the binding affinity in the Ala-scanning study,
and this residue is used for the cross-linking reaction with IgG in
the CCAP method.4 First, peptides possessing
a basic amino acid with a shortened lysine side chain, that is, ornithine
(Orn) and 2,4-diaminobutyric acid (Dab), 15-Lys8Orn and 15-Lys8Dab, respectively, were synthesized, and their antibody
binding affinity was analyzed by SPR (Table 3). 15-Lys8Dab with a two carbon
shorter side chain than Lys exhibited about 4-fold increased binding
affinity (Kd = 68.9 nM) compared with
15-IgBP (Kd = 267 nM), while 15-Lys8Orn exhibited lower affinity (Kd = 487 nM).
Thus, Dab at position 8 seemed to be the most attractive residue for
the CCAP method,4 because it showed the
highest binding affinity among the amino acid residues with a primary
amino group which can be utilized for the reaction with a cross-linker
reagent in the method. We prepared their acetylated forms, that is, 15-Lys8Lys(Ac), 15-Lys8Orn(Ac), and 15-Lys8Dab(Ac) to assess the effect of basicity on the antibody binding. Interestingly,
the affinity of 15-Lys8Orn(Ac) was increased by the acetylation
[15-Lys8Orn vs 15-Lys8Orn(Ac): Kd = 487 vs 138 nM], in contrary to Dab [15-Lys8Dab vs. 15-Lys8Dab(Ac): Kd =
68.9 vs 116 nM].

Derivatives with the Substitution at the Lys8 Positiona
a Binding affinity
was measured by

b Data are presented as mean ±
SE (n = 5).

In an attempt to understand these results, molecular modeling was
performed on the basis of the X-ray crystal structure of the Fc-III
peptide (PDB: 1DN2)11 (Figures 3 and S3). This
model shows that the antibody has two Glu residues (Glu380 and Glu382)
in the proximity of the binding region of Lys8 in 15-IgBP, suggesting
that the amino group interacts electrostatically with these Glu residues.
We speculate that the observed high affinity of 15-Lys8Dab can be attributed to the electrostatic interaction with Glu382.
This is consistent with the observation that acetylation of the amino
group decreases the affinity. On the other hand, the amino group of
Orn cannot form a favorable electrostatic interaction with the Glu
residues because they are too far apart. The acetylated Orn could
however gain a new hydrophobic interaction with Pro387 which is between
Glu380 and Glu382 (Figure 3), and this would
result in a higher affinity. This finding suggests that the structural
derivatization focused on hydrophobicity at position 8, which can
interact with the hydrophobic region around Pro387, could be a promising
way to obtain a higher binding affinity, as discussed in the next
paragraph. Additionally, the peptide 15-Lys8Arg shows
a strong binding affinity (Kd = 29.1 nM),
which might be attributed to the guanidino group interacting with
both Glu380 and Glu382 of the antibody. This peptide shows a fast-binding
feature with the highest kon value of
1.60 s–1·μM–1.

Figure 3 Model of the
antibody binding mode of peptide 1 around
the Lys8 position based on the X-ray cocrystal structure of human
IgG1 and Fc-III peptides (PDB: 1DN2). Peptide 1 and antibody
are shown as magenta and green ribbons, respectively. The antibody
surface is shown in atom colors (blue: nitrogen, red: oxygen, and
gray: carbon). Lys8 of peptide 1 and Glu380, Glu382,
and Pro387 of antibody are shown.

As mentioned above, we had focused on the hydrophobicity at position
8 in 15-IgBP but actually, the Fc-III peptide (Figure 1) has a hydrophobic Leu residue at this position.
First, the peptide with substitution of Lys8 for norleucine (Nle)
at position 8 (15-Lys8Nle) that corresponds to the des-ε-amino-Lys
peptide of 15-IgBP was synthesized and evaluated. The substitution
drastically increased the binding affinity (Kd = 36.7 nM) by 7 times with a slower dissociation rate (koff = 0.0261 s–1) than 15-IgBP,
indicating that the hydrophobic alkyl group was possibly better than
an amino group at this position, probably by associating with the
hydrophobic side chain of Pro387 in the antibody in spite of the existence
of anionic groups Glu380 and Glu382 in the proximity of the binding
site. With a shorter side chain, 15-Lys8Nva also showed
similar binding affinity (Kd = 44.6 nM).

Subsequently, branched alkyl group-containing amino acids were
introduced at the Lys8 position, and it was found that the peptides
with β-branched amino acids, Val or tert-leucine
(Tle), showed a lower affinity (Kd = 77.8
and 326 nM, respectively) with slow binding properties (kon = 0.335 and 0.118 s–1·μM–1, respectively), compared to those of 15-Lys8Nle (Kd = 36.7 nM, kon = 0.714 s–1·μM–1). Interestingly, the 15-Lys8Tle peptide has a similar Kd value to 15-IgBP (Kd = 267 nM), while the kon and koff values of 15-Lys8Tle were approximately
six times slower. These peptides are representative examples of IgG
binding peptides with similar affinities and different kinetic features,
which can support a variety of applications of the antibody based
on the kinetic effects of IgG binding peptides. On the other hand,
γ-branched structures highly enhance antibody binding affinity,
particularly with 15-Lys8Leu showing the lowest Kd value of 8.19 nM with fast-binding (1.47 s–1·μM–1) and slow-release
(0.0116 s–1) qualities. The residence time of 15-Lys8Leu calculated from the koff value is 86 s, which is 17 times longer than original peptide 1 and 15-IgBP which are resident each for 5 seconds. In addition,
bulkier amino acids such as tert-butylalanine [Ala(t-Bu), Kd = 15.6 nM] or cyclohexylalanine
(Cha, Kd = 17.0 nM) are also acceptable
for their high binding affinity. In particular, 15-Lys8Leu and 15-Lys8Cha containing residues with a secondary
carbon atom at the γ-position showed faster binding properties
(kon = 1.41–1.47 s–1·μM–1) than peptides with the tertiary
carbon structure [15-Lys8Ala(t-Bu)]
(kon = 0.975 s–1·μM–1). The affinity of 15-Lys8Phe (Kd = 40.0 nM) was similar to that of 15-Lys8Nle, indicating that an aromatic structure is also tolerated. In view
of the overall results, the γ-branched amino acids (e.g., Leu)
at position 8 were the most suited to the strong antibody binding
affinity.

In the analysis of the CD spectra, peptides with hydrophobic
amino
acid residues at the 8-position with a few exceptions (15-Lys8Val and 15-Lys8Tle) showed the maximum signal at 230 nm
(Supporting Information, Figure S2). This
is consistent with the aforementioned findings that the maximum signal
can be related to the binding affinity. However, the exceptional β-branched
peptides 15-Lys8Val and 15-Lys8Tle show
no maximum signal at 230 nm in spite of their binding affinities (Kd = 77.8 and 326 nM, respectively). Judging
from the maximum signal in the CD spectra, the peptides might not
adopt the conformation preferred for the binding because β-branched
amino acids, which form a type-I′ β-turn only with difficulty,27 exist at the turn structure, that is, at Lys8
and Gly9, and this disturbed turn structure might exhibit the slow
binding properties (kon = 0.335 and 0.118
s–1·μM–1) of the peptides.
This inference about the involvement of the turn structure on the kon value is supported by the fact that substitution
of Gly9 by Ala in the turn region also shows a low kon value in the Ala scanning (Table 1). On the other hand, 15-Lys8Val and 15-Lys8Tle show some measure of binding affinity,
probably because the slow binding property might be compensated by
a very slow releasing property (koff =
0.0261 and 0.0386 s–1, respectively) which derives
from the hydrophobic residue at position 8. This slowing effect on
the koff value by hydrophobic residues
at position 8 is supported by the results of the series of peptides
with hydrophobic residues [e.g., 15-Lys8Leu or 15-Lys8Ala(tBu) vs 15-IgBP, Table 3]. In contrast to 15-Lys8Val and 15-Lys8Tle, the other peptides such as His7Ala or Val12Ala with no maximal signal in the CD spectra
show no affinities in SPR (Figures 2 and S2), probably due to
their fast releasing features, although their koff values were not determined. These findings suggest that
the secondary structure indicated by the CD spectra of the peptides
is important for the strong antibody binding affinities and potent kon values.

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry
Measurements
Isothermal
titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements of representative derivatives,
such as peptide 1, 15-IgBP, 15-Lys8Tle and 15-Lys8Leu, were performed in order to compare the calorimetric
parameters (Table 4 and Figure 4). It
was found that the interaction of each peptide with human IgG1 (Herceptin) was exothermic (Supporting Information, Figure S4). The number of binding sites of the
four peptides is almost two what was expected from the C2 symmetric
structure of the antibody. The binding of these peptides is site-selective,
suggesting that these peptides would be highly applicable to the site-specific
conjugation method for the homogenous ADC preparation. Compared to
the other three peptides (peptide 1, 15-IgBP, and 15-Lys8Tle, Kd = 310, 210, and
200 nM, respectively), the Kd value of 15-Lys8Leu is notably low (12 nM) similar to those judging
by the results of SPR assay. In comparison with 1 and
15-IgBP, the deletion of N-terminal residues increased the entropy
(−TΔS = 0.16 vs 3.5
kcal/mol, respectively) while decreasing the enthalpy (ΔH = −9.1 vs −13 kcal/mol). This result suggests
that an enthalpy-driven feature of the binding is raised as a result
of the deletion of flexible N-terminal residues, especially the secondary
structure disruptors, Gly and Pro.28,29 On the other
hand, 15-IgBP and 15-Lys8Tle show no major difference
in the calorimetric parameters. Although they have different kon and koff values
as shown in Table 3, such kinetic rates cannot be assessed in ITC analysis in the absence
of a special protocol.30 The comparison
with 15-IgBP and 15-Lys8Leu indicated that the hydrophobic
substitution of Lys to Leu gained enthalpy (ΔH = −13 vs −15 kcal/mol), although generally, hydrophobic
interactions are considered to be entropy-driven. This suggests again
that the ε-amino group of Lys8 is energetically disfavored in
spite of its possible electrostatic interactions with Glu380 and Glu382,
when compared to the interaction provided by the hydrophobic alkyl
group. The peptide 15-Lys8Leu was obtained and found
to have the best enthalpy-driven feature with a high antibody binding
affinity (Kd = 12 ± 1 nM).

Conclusions
We synthesized 37 kinds of derivatives of IgG-binding peptide 1 (17 residues, Kd = 225 nM) and
evaluated their binding affinities against human IgG1 (Herceptin).
The results of Ala-scanning and truncation of peptide 1 revealed that two N-terminal residues (Gly1 and Pro2) are irrelevant
to the binding, but two C-terminal residues (Phe16 and His17) have
an impact on binding affinity. We obtained the shortened peptide (15-IgBP,
15 residues) which retains the affinity (Kd = 267 nM). During further structure derivatization of 15-IgBP, we
found that the Lys8 position is preferential for binding to the hydrophobic
structure, particularly γ-branched structures. This led to the
development of 15-Lys8Leu (Kd = 8.19 nM) which shows about 25-times higher affinity than 1 and 15-IgBP. We successfully obtained peptides with the
similar Kd values but with kon and koff values that are
approximately six-fold different (15-IgBP vs 15-Lys8Tle). These peptides could be useful in elucidation of the kinetic effect
for the function of IgG-binding peptides and development of a potent
covalent- or noncovalent-type conjugate with the antibody by using
the peptide with the appropriate kinetic feature. In addition, we
found that the conformational changes which were detected at 230–235
nm in the CD analysis affect the kon value.
This knowledge will be very helpful for the derivatization of more
potent IgG-binding peptides. Further SAR studies of 15-IgBP focused
on other residues are currently in progress.

Experimental Section
General
Procedures
Reagents and solvents were purchased
from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan), Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Louis, MO), Watanabe Chemical Industries (Hiroshima, Japan), and Tokyo
Chemical Industries (Tokyo, Japan). All were used as received. Herceptin
was purchased from Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. Mass spectra were
obtained on a Waters MICRO MASS LCT-premier mass spectrometer.

Solid-Phase
Peptide Synthesis
The IgG-binding peptides
were synthesized by the Fmoc-based peptide synthetic method21 using an automatic peptide synthesizer (Prelude).
Using the Fmoc-NH-SAL resin (40 μmol), the Fmoc group was deprotected
with 20% piperidine in dimethylformamide (DMF) for 10 min twice. The
peptide chains were elongated with the Fmoc-amino acid (5 equiv),
1-[bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridinium 3-oxide hexafluorophosphate (5 equiv), 1-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole
(5 equiv), and N,N-diisopropyl-ethylamine
(DIPEA, 10 equiv) for 30 min. These reactions were repeated to lengthen
the desired peptide. The N-terminal amino group was acetylated with
acetic anhydride (3 equiv) and DIPEA (3 equiv) in DMF for 15 min.
For the solid-phase disulfide formation, the synthesized resins were
treated with I2/DMF for 4 h. The resin was washed with
DMF until the color disappeared and washed with Et2O and
MeOH and then dried in vacuo. Cleavage from resin and final deprotection
was performed by the treatment with trifluoroacetyl (TFA)/triisopropylsilane
(TIS)/H2O/1,2-ethanedithiol (40:1:1:0.4) for 3 h. The crudes
were precipitated with Et2O and washed twice. After drying,
the residual solids were purified by reverse-phase (RP) high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) [SunFire PrepC18 OBD 19 × 150 mm
(5 μm)] to give the desired peptides. For the liquid-phase disulfide
formation, the pure peptides containing free thiol groups were obtained
by the same methods as described above regarding cleavage from the
peptidyl resins and HPLC purification. The peptides were dissolved
in 20% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0,
100 mM) and stirred for 48 h at rt. The solution was directly purified
by RP-HPLC [SunFire PrepC18 OBD 19 × 150 mm (5 μm)] to
give the desired peptides. The purity of synthesized peptides was
analyzed by RP chromatography (COSMOSIL 5C18 AR-II, 4.6
i.d. × 150 mm) using a binary solvent system with a linear gradient
starting from 10% MeCN in 0.1% TFA aq to 50% MeCN in 0.1% TFA aq at
a flow rate of 0.9 mL/min with detection at UV 230 nm. The peptides
that were used for kinetic analysis had an HPLC purity of >95%.
The
yields and analytical data are provided in the Supporting Information.

Acetylation of Peptide
Side Chains
After disulfide
bridging, the purified peptides were dissolved in DMSO at a concentration
of 2.5 μM. N-Succinimidyl acetate (10 equiv)
and N-methylmorphiline (20 equiv) were added to the
reaction solution. After 30 min, the desired peptides were directly
purified by RP-HPLC [SunFire PrepC18 OBD 19 × 150 mm (5 μm)].

CD Spectra
The CD spectra of the peptides were measured
under previously reported conditions17 using
a Jasco J-1500CD spectrometer (JASCO, Japan) in a quartz cell with
a 0.5 cm path length. Spectra were collected between 190 and 250 nm
with a scan speed of 100 nm/min, a response time of 1 s, and a bandwidth
of 1 nm at 25 °C. The peptides were dissolved in a 10 mM phosphate
buffer (pH7.4) including 10% 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol at a concentration
of 2.5 μM. The secondary structure composition of the peptide
was determined using software based on published methods.22

SPR Assay
The binding kinetics were
determined by a
Biacore T-200 system using the previous conditions.17 Herceptin (human IgG1) was dissolved in an acetate
buffer (pH 5.5) and immobilized by premixed N-hydroxysuccimimide
and EDC·HCl (1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride)
on a CM5 sensor chip. The analytes (peptide derivatives) were adjusted
to the desired concentration by a serial dilution in a running buffer
(HBS-EP; 0.01 M N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid, 0.15 M NaCl, 3 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid, 0.005% Tween 20, pH 7.4). The sensorgrams were obtained with
an association time of 180 s, a dissociation time of 600 s, and a
flow rate of 50 μL/min. To determine the binding kinetics (kon, koff and Kd), the sensorgrams obtained in this way were
analyzed by the Biacore T200 Evaluation software Ver. 1.0 using a
1:1 binding model. When the curve fitting was unreliable (U-value > 14), steady-state analysis was applied for
the
determination of the Kd value. As a negative
control, we applied the other species antibody, rat IgG2a. Because the representative peptide derivatives, 15-IgBP and 15-Lys8Leu, did not show detectable affinity (kon and koff also) against
the rat IgG2a, this series of peptides specifically bind
to human IgG (Herceptin) and affinity data of which are directly comparable.

Molecular Modeling
The crystal structure of the Fc
region of human IgG1 in a complex with the Fc-III peptide
(PDB code: 1DN2)11 was obtained from the Protein Data
Bank. To model the complex between peptide 1 and the
Fc region, the peptides were constructed on the basis of the secondary
structure of Fc-III by a molecular operating environment (MOE ver.
2018.0101) software. The minimization process was performed using
the Amber10:EHT force field.

ITC Measurement
The antibody bindings
of peptide 1, 15-IgBP, 15-Lys8Leu, and 15-Lys8Tle were estimated by ITC measurements, and the thermodynamic
parameters
are shown in Table 4. The concentration of peptide and antibody was normalized by the
absorbance at 280 nm. The experiment was performed under 25 °C
condition utilizing PEAQ-ITC (Microcal Inc.). The final concentration
of the antibody and peptides was 10–20 and 150–300 μM,
respectively. The data were fitted with the single-site binding model
utilizing analysis software-implemented I PEAQ-ITC software. The measurement
was performed three times for each sample.
