Hierarchical
micro/mesoporous carbons were prepared using ZnO nanoparticles
as hard templates and a petroleum industrial-residual pitch as the
carbon source via a solvent-free process. The ZnO templates can be
easily removed using HCl(aq), thereby avoiding limitations present
in conventional porous silica templating approaches that require highly
corrosive HF(aq) for template removal. Notably, the proposed solvent-free
synthetic method from low-cost pitch to high-value porous carbons
is a friendly process with respect to our overexploited environment.
With the combination of ZnO nanoparticles and pitch, the surface area
(76–548 m2 g–1) of the resultant
mesoporous carbons increases with an increase in the weight ratios
of ZnO to pitch. Furthermore, the hierarchical micro/mesoporous carbons
with a large surface area (854–1979 m2 g–1) can be feasibly fabricated by only adding an appropriate amount
of an activating agent. Meanwhile, N-doped hierarchical porous carbons
can be achieved by carbonizing the blend of these materials with melamine.
For supercapacitor application, the resultant carbons exhibit a high
capacitance up to 200.5 F g–1 at 5 mV s–1 using LiClO4/PC as the electrolyte in a symmetrical two-electrode
cell. More importantly, the coin-cell supercapacitor based on porous
carbons achieved a capacitance of 94 F g–1 at 5
mV s–1 and 63% capacitance retention at 500 mV s–1, thereby holding the potential for commercialization.

1 Introduction
Recently,
porous carbons with large surface areas, high electrical
conductivity, high chemical inertness, and tunable pore size have
become attractive materials in nanoscience and commercial business.
The porous carbons have been used in many applications, for example,
as absorbent materials, for gas absorption and storage, for catalyst
support, and as electrode materials for fuel cells, Li-ion batteries,
and supercapacitors.1−3 In general, porous carbons with high surface areas
and porosity are commonly synthesized using siliceous templates,4,5 with tunable structures, mesopore sizes, and morphologies. However,
such procedures relying on the fabrication of silica templates are
complicated, time-consuming, and unsuitable for large-scale production.6−8 Furthermore, the silica templates can be completely removed only
by using highly corrosive hydrofluoric acid, HF(aq), which is extremely
environmentally hazardous. On the contrary, nonsiliceous metal-oxide
templates are chemically inert during high-temperature carbonization;
therefore, using such templates, which can be removed by an acid solution,
is a possible alternative method to prepare porous carbons.9,10

In past research studies, resins have been usually used to
synthesize
porous carbons.11−13 Though many attractive and meaningful developments
have been made regarding porous carbons synthesized with resin, the
complicated synthetic procedures and electrical conductivity of the
resultant porous carbons need to be improved. On the contrary, pitch,
an industrial residue of petroleum, is cheap and abundant. The aromatic
hydrocarbons abundant in pitch, featuring sp2-hybridized
carbon atoms, can be polymerized and further aromatized to form carbons
with a high carbon yield at high temperatures.14−17 Porous carbons synthesized using
pitch possess a high specific surface area and tunable porosity after
the carbonization and activation process and can perform a critical
role in a supercapacitor.

Various synthesis approaches such
as the nanocasting method with
porous silica as the hard template and the self-assembling method
with amphiphilic surfactant as the soft template have been widely
used for the preparation of porous carbons.18−21 However, in these methods, it
normally takes a long time for the formation of the mesostructured
composite between the carbon precursor and the template separated
from the diluted solution, which leads to low efficiency and high
solvent waste. For comparison, a solvent-free route has many advantages,
such as reduced pollution, low cost, and simplicity in process and
handling, which are especially important in the industry. Considering
these merits, recently, a solvent-free route has been developed to
prepare nanomaterials, such as zeolites, N- and B-doped graphitic
carbon, and carbon nanotube.22,23 Obviously, it is very
desirable to develop a solvent-free approach for the synthesis of
porous carbons with a high surface area and tunable porosity.

A supercapacitor is a useful and widespread device that stores
energy by accumulating ions on the interface between the electrolyte
and the electrode.24−27 Supercapacitors are used in many electric products because of their
high power density, long cycle life, and superior safety compared
with secondary batteries. Nevertheless, they are limited by low energy
density, which causes increased device volume and cost because of
the low pore volume of the commercially available microporous carbons
(pore size < 2.0 nm). Therefore, it is paramount to design a nanostructured
porous carbon with pore properties tailored specifically for the application
in supercapacitors.28−33

In this study, novel hierarchical micro/mesoporous carbons
using
ZnO as the hard template and cheap petroleum industrial-residual pitch
as the carbon source have been prepared, as illustrated in Figure 1. The ZnO templates
can be almost completely removed by a hydrochloride solution, avoiding
the use of highly corrosive HF(aq) for the removal of the silica template.
The resultant carbons with a controllable surface area with mesopores
can be fabricated by adjusting the ZnO/pitch weight ratio. Furthermore,
micro/mesoporous carbons with a large specific surface area and pore
volume can be generated by the addition of an activating agent. Meanwhile,
the N-doped porous carbons with a high surface area and a micro/mesoporous
structure can be approached by further blending melamine, which acts
as a nitrogen source. To characterize and evaluate the commercialization
potential of the resultant hierarchical porous carbons, tested as
the electrode material in the conventional symmetrical two-electrode
cell and simulation as commercial coin-cell supercapacitors was conducted.
On the basis of the hierarchical micro/mesopore and nitrogen-doped
properties of the carbons, these as-synthesized porous carbons exhibit
excellent performance as the electrode material for supercapacitors.

micro/mesoporous carbons.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization
of the Mesoporous Carbon
Prepared from Petroleum Pitch
The morphology of the ZnO template
and the resultant mesoporous carbon is shown in Figure 2a,b. The ZnO template consists of ZnO nanoparticles
with a size of approximately 20–30 nm. After removing the ZnO
template by acid solution, one can clearly see that the pore size
of the mesopores in the resultant carbon is close to the ZnO particle
size, which indicates that the pores of the porous carbon were formed
from an integral casting of the petroleum pitch on the ZnO template.
Meanwhile, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image for the
as-prepared carbon was further measured, as shown in Figure S1. Impressively, a highly porous structure with thin
carbon walls can be obtained. The thermal gravimetric analyses of
the obtained samples are shown in Figure 2c. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves
demonstrate that the ZnO residual content in the mesoporous carbon
after HCl etching is approximately 0%. The key point of our synthesis
strategy to produce porous carbons is the formation of the high-connectivity
ZnO/carbon composite and the use of the easily removed ZnO template.
It was also found that the pitch-derived carbon material has high
thermal stability with a decomposition temperature higher than 600
°C. To further study the carbon structure in the stable mesoporous
carbon from petroleum pitch, we analyzed the defect level of the carbon
structure by comparing the intensity ratio (ID/IG) of the D-band (1350 cm–1) and the G-band (1580 cm–1) in
the Raman spectrum (Figure 2d). The ID/IG value for the prepared mesoporous carbons is 0.41, suggesting
a low defect level. These results demonstrate that the solvent-free
synthesis of the high-value carbon material from ZnO templates blending
the petroleum industrial-residual pitch was achieved in our study.

ratio of 4.0.

2.2 Effect
of the ZnO/Pitch Weight Ratio on the
Surface Area of the Mesoporous Carbon
The tunable surface
area and the pore volume of porous carbons are key factors for their
applications. In this study, it was demonstrated that the surface
area and the pore volume of the porous carbons can be easily controlled
by adjusting the ZnO/pitch weight ratio. Interestingly, it was observed
that the surface areas of the prepared porous carbons increased linearly
from 76 to 318 m2 g–1 with an increase
in the ZnO/pitch weight ratio from 0.5 to 4 (Figure 3). Within this range, the ZnO nanoparticles
with nanospaces function as a nanotemplate for the pitch. Above the
softening point, the liquid-behavior pitch can penetrate into the
textual pores between ZnO nanoparticles via capillary adsorption.
Then, the polymerization reaction of the pitch will take place to
yield interconnected polymer films made of aromatic structures for
integral casting of the ZnO template. This result reveals that the
hard templates with textual mesopores play an important role in integral
casting of the melting carbon precursors to control the surface area
and the mesoporosity of the resultant mesoporous carbons. At a ZnO/pitch
weight ratio larger than 4.0, the ZnO content is too high to be completely
covered by the pitch, which decreases the pore-formation performance
of the ZnO template.

composites
at different weight ratios.

To understand the high-integrity casting and the feasible
removal
of the ZnO template, the decomposition profiles of the pure pitch,
the ZnO/pitch mixture (4/1 in weight ratio), and the ZnO template
were measured by TGA under a nitrogen atmosphere, as shown in Figure 4. The carbon precursor/pitch
showed a decomposition initiating at approximately 200 °C, and
its residual weight percentage at 900 °C is approximately 48%,
which means a high carbon yield from pitch sources. In comparison
to the TGA profiles of ZnO and the pitch, the ZnO/pitch mixture had
an additional weight loss at approximately 800 °C. This decomposition
is ascribed to carbothermal reduction of partial ZnO nanoparticles
at a temperature higher than 800 °C in the presence of carbon.34 The resultant zinc nanoparticles and carbon
monoxide gases lead to foam formations that increase the interconnectivity
of the carbon/ZnO matrix (Figure S2). Because
of the high connectivity of the carbon/ZnO matrix, ZnO can be almost
completely etched in a moderate acidic solution.

and (III) ZnO template under an N2 atmosphere.

2.3 Micro/Mesoporosity Control
via the Addition
of an Activating Agent
It is well-known that a large surface
area is a primary requirement for obtaining a high specific capacitance
for carbon electrodes. Therefore, different activating agents, K2CO3 and KOH, were blended with ZnO and the pitch
to increase the surface areas of the porous carbons by introducing
microporosity.35−37Table 1 shows the textural parameters of the hierarchical micro/mesoporous
carbons activated by K2CO3 and KOH at different
activating agents/pitch weight ratios. The resultant carbons activated
by K2CO3 were observed to have a large improvement
in their surface area up to 1272 m2 g–1 when the ZnO/pitch/KOH ratio was 4:1:3. Furthermore, the porous
carbons activated by KOH exhibited a high surface area of 1979 m2 g–1 when the ZnO/pitch/KOH ratio was 4:1:1.
At a high temperature, both K2CO3 and KOH can
react with carbon to corrode its framework, which creates micropores.
This process takes place via a mechanism similar to that operating
during the chemical activation of carbonaceous materials with alkali
hydroxide.38 The reaction mechanism of
K2CO3 and KOH activation is as follows

d St = SBET × carbon yield.

Initially, the enhancement
of the activating agent increases not
only the value of the specific surface area but also the porosity
because of the activating agent corroding the carbon structure. However,
a larger amount of the activating agent leads to more violent corrosion
of the carbon framework, which generally reduces the carbon yield.
To estimate the performance of the activation agent, we multiplied
the Brunauer−Emmett−Teller (BET) equation surface areas
by carbon yields to get the total surface areas (denoted as St values). In Table 1, it can be clearly seen that the largest St values occur at K2CO3/pitch of 0.5/1 and KOH/pitch of 0.75/1 by using K2CO3 and KOH as activating agents, respectively. At a lower activating
agent/pitch ratio, the surface area contributed from microporosity
is low. Although the activating agent/pitch ratio is too high, the
carbon yield is much reduced, which leads to a low St value. Consequently, adding the appropriate amount of
the activating agent is critical for controlling the porosity and
surface area of the prepared porous carbons. In brief, we provide
a simple synthetic method to fine-tune the surface area ratio of the
micropore to the mesopore by controlling the amount of the activating
agent and the weight ratio of ZnO/pitch.

2.4 Structural Characterizations of N-Doped Porous
Carbons
It has been confirmed that an appropriate nitrogen
content in the carbon framework can significantly enhance both the
electronic conductivity and the wettability of the interface between
the electrolyte and the electrode, thereby improving the performance
of carbon as an electrode material in supercapacitors.39−41 In this study, the N-doped porous carbons (CN) were synthesized
by simply blending melamine with the aforementioned mixture. For comparison,
C2, the carbon without N-doping, was made with the same weight ratio
of ZnO, pitch, and K2CO3, as shown in Table 1.

From elemental analysis data, the nitrogen
content in the obtained N-doped porous carbon was approximately 3.6
wt % with a weight ratio of ZnO/pitch/activating agent/melamine of
4:1:1:0.5. In Figure S3, the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms show that significant differences
exist between the CN and C2 curves. CN has already
absorbed abundant nitrogen at low pressure. The specific surface areas
of CN and C2 are 1375 and 1231 m2 g–1, respectively, with microporous surface areas of 747 and 520 m2 g–1. This indicates that CN has
more micropores in the carbon framework and an enhancement of the
specific surface area, confirming that melamine changes the distribution
of pores via its interaction with K2CO3 and
completely binds with the pitch to produce N-doped porous carbons.
The presence of nitrogen group on the surfaces of CN was
confirmed by XPS, as shown in Figure S4. The peaks centered at 398.5 and 400.5 eV can be assigned to the
pyridinic- and graphitic-type nitrogen atoms doped at the edges and
in-between the graphitic carbon layers, respectively. It is clear
that CN contains larger percentages of pyridinic and pyrrolic
types of nitrogen, which are reported to be responsible for the active
sites. Thus, the simple blend with the carbon precursor, nitrogen-containing
precursor, and ZnO template via a solvent-free route and pyrolysis
at a high temperature led to the effective formation of nitrogen-doped
porous carbon materials.

2.5 Supercapacitor Performance
of the Hierarchical
Micro/Mesoporous Carbons
2.5.1 Conventional Symmetrical
Two-Electrode Cell
Test
It is known that the presence of mesopores among the
carbons is helpful for fast mass transport of ions at high charging
rates.42−45Figure 5a shows cyclic
voltammograms of the conventional two-electrode cell assembled with
the hierarchical micro/mesoporous carbon (C7) with the surface area
of 1537 m2 g–1. The cells behave similar
to an ideal double-layer capacitor with an almost symmetric and rectangular
shape at various potential scan rates. Furthermore, the specific capacitance
value was high, that is, 200.5 F g–1 at 5 mV s–1. Figure 5b shows the Nyquist plot of the C7 cell measured at 0 V. The
semicircle appearing within the high-frequency range in the plots
can be accounted for as an R//C equivalent-circuit
unit consisting of a double-layer capacitance at the electrode/electrolyte
interface in parallel with a charge-transfer resistance (Rct) through the pseudocapacitance process. The intersection
of the forefront of the semicircle with the x-axis
gives the ionic resistance, Ri, of the
electrolyte, whereas the span of the semicircle along the x-axis provides Rct. Accordingly,
the Ri and Rct values for C7 cell are 3.8 and 0.5 Ω, respectively. Both the
high specific capacitance and the low resistance confirm the great
performance of C7 as an electrode in a symmetric two-electrode cell.
In addition, Figure 5c shows the specific capacitance values and capacitance retention
of the C7 electrode at various scan rates. The C7 cell delivered 89.6
F g–1 at the largest scan rate of 500 mV s–1, constituting a 46% retention rate. Furthermore, for cycle stability
test, the capacitance drops was approximately 5% after the 8000 cycle
test, as shown in Figure 5d. The retention in capacity at a high scan rate is ascribed
to the mechanical resistance from fabrication and the obstacle of
ionic transportation. In addition to effectively increasing the specific
surface area of the hierarchical porous carbons, the micropores also
play a critical role in creating ion transportation resistance because
of their small tunnel size, thereby limiting migration and diffusion
of ions. Hence, the hierarchical porous carbon with the optimum ratio
of micropores to mesopores is beneficial for a supercapacitor to achieve
high electrochemical performance. Figure S5a,b shows the representative galvanostatic charge–discharge curves
of C7 cell with organic and aqueous electrolytes, at different current
loads from 0.5 to 9.0 A g–1. The triangular shape
recorded confirms both a good capacitive behavior and superior charge
propagation throughout the porous carbon electrode both in the organic
and in the aqueous electrolyte system. Furthermore, cyclic voltammogram
and the capacitance retention versus the voltage scan rate for C7
cell with an aqueous electrolyte (6.0 M KOH(aq)) are shown in Figure S6. The cells behave similar to an ideal
double-layer capacitor with an almost symmetric and rectangular shape
at various potential scan rates and delivered an 80% retention rate
at the largest scan rate of 500 mV s–1.

voltammograms, (b) ac impedance (the inset shows a magnified
view of the high-frequency region), (c) specific capacitance and capacitance
retention vs voltage scan rate, and (d) cycle stability for C7 in

2.5.2 Coin-Cell Supercapacitor Test
To
evaluate the capability and the commercialization potential of the
prepared hierarchical porous carbons, the easy-assembling coin-cell
supercapacitors are more notable than the laboratory-used symmetric
two-electrode cell used in the energy industry. In this section, coin-cell
supercapacitors are fabricated by three different frameworks of as-synthesized
hierarchical porous carbons, namely, C5 (micropore is a major portion
in carbon materials), C7, and CN, as discussed in the following.
The capacitance values of C5, C7, and CN are 67, 94, and
84 F g–1, respectively, at a scan rate of 5 mV s–1. This reveals that a higher specific surface area
of hierarchical porous carbons can enhance the specific capacitance.

The CV curves of the coin cells containing the three above-mentioned
hierarchical porous carbons are compared in Figure 6. All CV curves exhibit nearly rectangular
profiles at various potential scan rates, indicating nearly ideal
capacitor behaviors. Furthermore, the C7 cell exhibited a higher capacitance
retention at 63% compared with C5 (at 45%) at high potential scan
rates, as shown in Figure 7a, which is attributed to its hierarchical micro/mesopores
structure. Although mesopores play a limited role in storing charge,
they provide suitable space to allow ions of bulky electrolytes to
transport smoothly to the carbon framework and thus deliver more effective
access than micropores. As such, a balance between micropores and
mesopores should be obtained in the supercapacitor. In addition, the
retention rate of the CN cell is higher than that of the
C5 cell, despite their pore size distribution varying only slightly.
Because nitrogen can not only wet the interface between the carbon
surface and the electrolyte but also increase the conductivity of
CN, nitrogen doped into the hierarchical porous carbon
minimizes the resistance of the supercapacitor. The Nyquist plot in Figure 7b also provides evidence
for their difference in terms of resistance via the high-frequency
part. As seen, the Rct values for the
C5, C7, and CN cells are 3.0, 0.8, and 2.9 Ω, respectively.
Again, the C7 and CN cells show a lower resistance than
the C5 cell. From a commercial point of view, the C7 cell can be applied
as the electrode material in a coin-cell supercapacitor with the specific
capacitances of 94 F g–1 at 5 mV s–1 and 59 F g–1 at 500 mV s–1 with
a retention rate of 63%.

3 Conclusions
In this study, a simple physical blending method
to transform the
petroleum industrial-residual pitch into value-added porous carbons
with hierarchical pores has been provided. In addition, the ZnO template
was simply removed by hydrochloric acid, thereby avoiding the use
of highly corrosive hydrofluoric acid. Hierarchical porous carbons
with tunable specific surface areas, pore volumes, and micropores/mesopores
ratios were feasibly synthesized by changing the ZnO/pitch ratios
and activating reagent additions. Although the ZnO nanoparticles are
an appropriate template, the Zn2+ ion aqueous solution
needs to be recycled rather than discarded. In addition to the ZnO
template and the petroleum pitch, other environment-friendly inorganic
nanoparticles [such as MgO, Ca(OH)2, CaCO3,
Ca3PO4, etc.] and other industrial wastes (e.g.,
lignin and other biobased residue) can also be considered as hard
templates and carbon precursors to prepare the hierarchical porous
carbons. The feasibility of using these new inorganic templates and
carbon sources needs to be further studied. The hierarchical porous
carbons have been used as potential electrode materials in supercapacitors
and electrochemical applications.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Synthesis of Hierarchical Micro/Mesoporous
Carbons
To prepare the hierarchical porous carbons, the industrial-residual
petroleum pitch (CF19, softening point of approximately 120 °C,
provided by Chinese Petroleum Corporation, Taiwan), ZnO (AZO900, Diamonchem
International Co, Taiwan), and alkaline metal carbonates (K2CO3 and KOH, purchased from Merck) were used as the carbon
source, the hard template, and activating agents, respectively. The
typical synthesis procedure is as follows: the pitch, the hard template,
and activating agents were directly ground into a mixture by using
a blender. The weight ratios in the mixture are represented by x/y/z, where x is the template weight, y is the pitch weight,
and z is the activating agent weight. The resultant
powder was sealed in a stainless steel vessel and then directly heated
in a furnace. The heating rate was set at 8 °C min–1 and held at a carbonization temperature of 900 °C for 2 h.
After cooling to room temperature, the sample was washed with DI water
and soaked in an appropriate amount of 3.0 M HCl solution under stirring
for 2 h to remove the alkaline oxides and ZnO. Subsequent filtration,
washing with DI water, and drying at 100 °C yielded the porous
carbons.

4.2 Structural Characterization
The morphology
and pore size of the resultant porous carbons were examined on a field
emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JEOL JSM7000F, USA).
TEM was conducted using a Hitachi H-7500 microscope. The inorganic
residue in the resultant porous carbons and the carbon-to-inorganic
template ratio of the particle composition was characterized using
a TGA (TA Instruments Q50, USA), heated from 100 to 900 °C with
a ramp rate of 20 °C min–1 under an air or
nitrogen atmosphere. A micro Raman spectrometer from Renishaw with
a He–Ne laser source with a wavelength of 633 nm was used to
determine the structure of the porous carbons. The N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms of all samples were taken at 77 K on a micrometric TriStar
II apparatus to estimate the pore sizes and surface areas. The pore-size
distribution curves were obtained from the analysis of adsorption
isotherms using the BJH (Barrett–Joyner–Halenda) method.

4.3 Electrode Preparation and Electrochemical
Characterization
A symmetrical two-electrode capacitor cell
was used to examine the electrochemical performance of the porous
carbon electrodes. Both electrodes were made with approximately 2.0
mg carbons on 1.0 cm2 stainless foil, which acts as a current
collector. This cell consisted of two carbon electrodes, sandwiching
a cellulose filter paper as the separator. A coin-cell (CR2032) capacitor
was prepared as follows. First, to construct the electrode, the carbon
material (90 wt %) and polyvinylidene fluoride (10 wt %) were thoroughly
mixed in N-methyl-pyrrolidone. The resultant slurry
was coated onto a stainless foil current collector with approximately
3.0 mg cm–2 for carbon materials and dried under
vacuum at 120 °C for 12 h. Finally, the coin cells were assembled
in a dry and inert glove box with the two carbon electrodes and the
cellulose filter paper as the separator.

Cyclic voltammetry
measurements were recorded between −2.0 and 2.0 V in an 1.0
M LiClO4/PC solution and between 0 and 1.0 V in an 6.0
M KOH solution at sweep rates ranging from 5 to 500 mV s–1. Plots of specific capacitance versus voltage for the symmetrical
two-electrode cell were calculated using the following formula  where I represents the current
(A), v is the scan rate (V s–1),
and m denotes the mass (g) of the carbon material
in one electrode. The specific gravimetric capacitance of a single
electrode (F g–1) determined from the galvanostatic
cycles was calculated by the following equation  where
dV/dt is the slope of the discharge
curve (V s–1). Electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy measurements were recorded at an open-circuit
voltage (0 V) within the frequency range of 1 mHz to 100 kHz at a
5 mV amplitude.
