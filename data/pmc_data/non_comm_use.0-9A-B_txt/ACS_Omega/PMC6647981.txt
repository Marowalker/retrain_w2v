Understanding the carbon formation
mechanism is critical for designing
catalysts in various applications. Here, we report the observation
of the carbon formation mechanism on Ni-based catalysts by environmental
transmission electron microscopy (ETEM) over a wide temperature range
in combination with molecular dynamics simulations and density functional
theory calculations. In situ TEM observation performed in a C2H2/H2 atmosphere provides real-time
evidence that Ni3C is an intermediate phase that decomposes
to graphitic carbon and metallic Ni, leading to carbon formation.
Mechanisms of acetylene decomposition and evolution of carbon atom
configuration are revealed by molecular dynamics simulations, which
corroborate the experimental results. The modification of MgO on NiO
can effectively decrease the formation of graphitic layers and thus
enhance the catalytic performance of NiO. This finding may provide
an insight into the origin of the carbon deposition and aid in developing
effective approaches to mitigate it.

Introduction
Understanding the carbon
formation mechanism is critical for many
technical applications, including steam reforming, methanation, and
solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).1−7 SOFCs are the most efficient and benign energy conversion devices
for wide applications from portable and transportation power to stationary
plants.8 The operation of SOFCs with various
hydrocarbon-based fuels has attracted much attention during the last
decade. Although nickel has excellent catalytic activity and is a
good steam-reforming catalyst, the Ni-cermet anodes tend to suffer
from carbon deposition (coking) and sulfur poisoning in hydrocarbon
fuels.9,10 Thus, the development of nickel-free conducting
metal oxides has been a subject of considerable interest. Perovskites,
La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3−δ,11 (La,Sr)TiO3,12 BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2–xYbxO3−δ,13 and double-perovskites,
Sr2Mg1–xMnxMoO6−δ,9 have been reported as possible alternative anode materials.
They showed improved tolerance to coking, reoxidation, and/or sulfur
poisoning under various SOFC operating conditions. However, the power
densities of the SOFCs with these anodes are still not satisfactory
compared with conventional Ni cermet anodes.13 Therefore, all of these anode materials have not yet been used in
practical SOFC systems. Recently, we demonstrated enhanced tolerance
to coking of the Ni cermet anode in hydrocarbon-fueled SOFCs by impregnating
a small amount of MgO (1.25–3.75 wt %) into the porous anode.14 Owing to the complexity of the heterogeneous
reaction mechanism for CH4 oxidation,15 the carbon formation mechanism remains to be elucidated.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations or in situ and ex situ
experimental techniques combined with DFT calculations have been developed
to address this problem,16−21 but revealing the mechanism of catalytic carbon growth is still
a challenging task. Here, we study a MgO-modified NiO catalyst under
a C2H2/H2 atmosphere in the temperature
range in which SOFCs operate, using in situ transmission electron
microscopy (TEM), in an attempt to unravel the carbon formation mechanism.
It is found that Ni3C is an intermediate phase during the
carbon deposition process. The modification of MgO on NiO can effectively
decrease the formation of graphitic layers and thus enhance the catalytic
performance of NiO. Acetylene decomposition, carbon solute reduction,
and surface carbon shell evolution are provided by molecular dynamics
simulations. The origin of the enhanced coking-resistant performance
of the MgO-modified NiO catalyst is ascribed to the improved thermodynamic
stability of lattice oxygens.

Experimental Methods
Material Preparation
NiO powders were synthesized by
a glycine-nitrated combustion process.22 The MgO-modified NiO was prepared by impregnating a solution of
magnesium acetate [MgO(CH3COO)2·4H2O] into the NiO powders and annealing at 400 °C for 1
h. The MgO loading is about 2 wt %.

Material Characterization
The crystal structures of
the as-prepared NiO and MgO-modified NiO were examined by X-ray diffraction
(XRD) measurements (Panalytical instrument X’Pert 3 Powder)
with Cu Kα radiation in the 2θ range of 20–80°.
The morphology and microstructure of the sample were observed on a
transmission electron microscope at a working voltage of 200 kV (JEOL
JEM-2200FS).

In Situ TEM Characterization
A small
quantity of the
above prepared powder was dispersed in deionized water in an ultrasonic
bath for 20 min. Several drops of the solution were put on a Si window
with a continuous silicon nitride thin film (Dura SiN), in which there
are homogeneously distributed 2 μm holes with 10 μm spacing
between the holes. After the solution was dried in air, the Dura SiN
was mounted on a Gatan single tilt heating holder.

A Hitachi
H-9500 environmental transmission electron microscope (ETEM) was employed
in the current investigation. The electron source of the current H-9500
ETEM is LaB6. To further decrease the beam damage to the
specimen, the beam was kept off during the heating process unless
an image or diffraction pattern was being collected. A slow heating
rate is beneficial for NiO to get fully reduced and for the TEM specimen
to decrease thermal drift. However, the pumping out of the H2 + C2H2 gases released into the TEM specimen
chamber relies on a single high-speed turbo molecular pump (TMP).
A long pumping time will fail the TMP by overheating. Therefore, a
reasonably slow heating rate and a low-pressure level (e.g., 10 °C/min
and 0.15 Pa, respectively) were chosen in this experiment to avoid
the overload of the TMP.

Simulations
The C2H2 decomposition
and carbon deposition are simulated by the molecular dynamics package
LAMMPS. The reactive force field, ReaxFF, is used to describe the
interactions of the atoms and the formation/breaking of the chemical
bonds.23 The ReaxFF parameters are taken
from the literature,24 which are specially
fitted to describe the Ni and hydrocarbon systems. The time step is
specified to 0.25 fs. At each deposition stage, a single carbon atom
is randomly deposited near the surface of the Ni cluster. Minimization
is then performed to remove the spurious forces in the system. Microcanonical
equilibration is then performed at 300 K, where the total atom number
(N), the temperature (T), and the
volume (V) for the system are fixed, and a Bussi
thermostat is then employed. The system is first brought to the target
temperature of 1600 K, and then kept at 1600 K for 225 ps. Finally,
the prolonged relaxation effect is accounted for by performing another
100 000 steps of force-biased Monte-Carlo simulation with a
displacement of 0.1 Å.25 This stage
is repeated until the carbon atoms needed are deposited.

First-principles
calculations are performed by the Vienna ab initio package. The wave
functions are expanded using a plane-wave cutoff of 400 eV. The valence
core interactions are described by the projected augmented-wave method.
A 3 × 3 × 3 Monkhorst–Pack K-mesh
is used to sample the Brillouin zone. All structures are relaxed until
the force amplitudes are less than 0.05 eV/Å. Exchange–correlation
effects are described by the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
functional within the generalized gradient approximation. The strong
correlation effect of Ni 3d orbital is addressed by the DFT + U method with an effective U = 4.2 eV.
Due to the poor description of DFT of the O2 ground state,
the O2 energy is corrected against H2O and H2 energies to reproduce the measured H2O formation
energy.

Results and Discussion
In Situ TEM Characterization
In an attempt to accelerate
the carbon deposition, a mixture of C2H2/H2 (volume ratio = 1:4), rather than CH4 or C3H8 commonly used as fuels in hydrocarbon-fueled
SOFCs, was employed. Figure S1 (Supporting
Information) shows XRD patterns of NiO and MgO-modified NiO samples. Figure S2 shows an annular dark-field (ADF) scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image and the line-scanning
profiles of elements across one particle. It can be seen that NiO
particles are covered with MgO nanoparticles. Figure 1b–e shows snapshots of NiO and MgO-modified
NiO catalysts at ambient temperature and 800 °C in C2H2/H2, respectively. For the NiO catalyst,
it can be seen that Ni particles are encapsulated by thick graphitic
layers at 800 °C, as indicated by the arrows for a comparison.
However, for the MgO-modified NiO catalyst, there are no obvious graphitic
layers wrapping Ni particles (indicated by red arrows). The corresponding
videos of NiO and MgO-modified NiO are shown as Supporting Materials Videos 1 and 2, respectively.
Furthermore, Figure S4 shows a graphitic
layer comparison between the NiO and the MgO-modified samples. In
an alternative region of the same in situ experiment for the NiO sample,
thick graphitic layers can be seen (Figure S3a), which can be easily identified from their typical layer feature.
The electron energy loss spectrum collected confirms this observation. Figure S3b displays the same region as Figure 1e. From the high-resolution
TEM (HRTEM) image, we can see that the graphitic layers are formed,
but their thickness is greatly reduced compared with those in Figure S3a.

Figure 2 shows the
in situ evolution of the selected area electron diffraction (SAED)
pattern with temperature for NiO and MgO-modified NiO, respectively.
In the collected ring patterns, the same ring and its indexed phase(s)
are marked by arrows and text with the same color. The overlapping
of the main diffractions of NiO, Ni, and hexagonal Ni3C
brings difficulty to the ring pattern indexation. Among them, although
NiO(111) overlaps Ni3C(104), it still can be considered
as an indication of the existence of NiO due to the very high intensity
of NiO(111) compared with Ni3C(104). There is no overlapping
of Ni(200) with NiO and Ni3C, and thus Ni(200) can be used
as an indication of the appearance of Ni. The Ni(200) diffraction
is seen (the first green arrow in Figure 2A) for the NiO sample heated at 432 °C.
In their study of reduction of nickel oxide by hydrogen, Jeangros
et al. found the diffraction of Ni(200) appeared at 405 °C.26 Because we applied a large time gap between
the sequential image/diffraction collection to lessen beam damage
to the sample, we could not monitor the time at which the appearance
of Ni(200) diffraction started, even though our result agrees with
Jeangros’s result fairly well if we only consider the reduction
of H2. At 625 °C, we did not find NiO(111) diffraction,
which suggests that NiO reduction has been completed prior to 625
°C. Because C2H2 coexists with H2 in this investigation, rather than a reduction reaction between
H2 and NiO, C2H2 can also be involved
through the reactions below.27 1  and/or 2  The thermodynamic calculation shows that the
free standard reaction enthalpies of eqs 1 and 2 are −140 and −120
kJ/mol, respectively.28,29 Thus it indicates that both eqs 1 and 2 are thermodynamically possible in the current investigation temperature
range. When C2H2 adsorbed at Ni (111)/O (2×2)
was heated up to 325 °C, the observation of CO formation suggests
that reaction (2) is
more favorable.30

pattern with temperature: (A) NiO; (B) MgO-modified
NiO. See text for the discussion of the ring pattern diffraction assignments.

The reshaping of the metal catalysts
is a common phenomenon during
the formation of carbon nanotube (CNT).16,31−34 Hofmann et al. found the “liquid-like” feature of
Ni during the growth of CNT.31 They attributed
it to the fast self-diffusivity of Ni. The melting temperature for
pure Ni is 1455 °C.35 Under equilibrium
condition, when the addition of carbon reaches around 2.8 atom %,
the melting temperature of Ni(C) decreases to 1326.5 °C.36 Rapid cooling can bring the solubility of carbon
in Ni up to 7.9 atom % (hereafter, we denote C-added Ni as Ni(C))
and bring the melting temperature of Ni(C) down to around 1025 °C.36 Carbon-rich phase diagrams of Ni–C nanoparticles
show that Ni(C) nanoparticle melting is strongly favored by carbon
incorporation and proceeds from the surface to the core.37Supporting Materials Video 3 shows that the melting of Ni(C) and graphitic layer formation
proceed simultaneously. Based on the above discussion, we postulate
that both reactions 1 and 2 happen and that Ni3C formed
by reaction 2 decomposes
to Ni(C) and carbon, and then the carbon goes into the metal Ni matrix
reduced by reaction 1 to rapidly increase its carbon content. This, in turn, lowers the
melting temperature of Ni(C) and turns Ni(C) into the molten state
at a relatively low heating temperature. Therefore, the diffraction,
which is initially assigned to both NiO(220) and Ni3C(116),
now can be solely assigned to Ni3C(116) (red arrow in Figure 2A). Similarly, diffraction
that was assigned to NiO(200) before is assigned to Ni(111) and Ni3C(116) (cyan arrows). When NiO was heated up to 800 °C,
Ni3C(116) diffraction vanished. Meanwhile, the diffraction
of C(002) becomes stronger. Obviously, Ni3C fully decomposes
to Ni(C) and C.

The SAED pattern of MgO-modified NiO does not
exhibit a well-defined
ring pattern until the heating temperature reaches 565 °C. The
ring pattern at 565 °C is quite similar to that of NiO at 550
°C, except for the diffraction belonging to carbon (e.g., C(002))
being present in the latter (white arrow in Figure 2A), whereas there is no detectable graphitic
carbon in MgO-modified NiO. When the heating temperature reaches 625
°C, there is still no obvious C(002) ring in the SAED pattern
of MgO-modified NiO, but C(002) diffraction is very apparent in that
of the NiO sample. Unlike NiO, NiO(111) diffraction in MgO-modified
NiO is still visible at 625 °C. It seems that the addition of
MgO to NiO postpones the full reduction of NiO. In addition, even
after longer time at 800 °C, the diffraction of Ni3C(116) still exists for MgO-modified NiO and the C(002) diffraction
is less intensive compared with that of NiO. Therefore, we postulate
that the addition of MgO to NiO postpones the full decomposition of
Ni3C, which in turn leads to less graphitic carbon formation
in MgO-modified NiO.

To unveil the mechanism of carbon deposition
in NiO and MgO-modified
NiO, another set of in situ experiments were conducted. In this set
of runs, a higher magnification was employed. Figure 3 shows snapshots of high-resolution TEM (HRTEM)
videos of graphitic layer formation in NiO and MgO-modified NiO, respectively.
The black arrow in Figure 3A illustrates the advancing direction of the graphitic layers.
Although the carbon deposition layer keeps advancing, the size of
the Ni(C) particle shrinks in the direction indicated by the red arrow
until the Ni(C) particle is encapsulated by the graphitic layer. Compared
with NiO, the graphitic layer thickness in MgO-modified NiO is thinner
and does not change much with time. Besides, the shape of the particle
remains the same. The green arrow in the image indicates the surface
without an obvious graphitic layer.

Figure 3 (A) Snapshot of the advancing edge of
the graphitic layer in NiO
and (B) Formation of the graphitic layer from a modulation region
in MgO-modified NiO.

On close observation of the region where the carbon layers
generate,
as indicated by the black arrows in Figure 4, we find that the carbon layers come from
a modulated region. Since modulation is usually related to an intermediate
phase between phase changes,38 we believe
that the formation of the graphitic layers results from the decomposition
of modulated carbide. Besides, there is no melting phenomenon happening
during this process. This possibly explains the slower graphitic layer
growth rate as compared with that in NiO. Fourier transformation image
processing on the chosen area within the modulated carbide region
(marked by a square) shows the existence of the dislocation within
the structure (marked by arrows in the inset in Figure 4). This is due to the strain induced by the
decomposition of carbide. The results revealed by Figure 4 suggest that there are possible
different mechanisms governing graphitic layer formation in NiO and
MgO-modified NiO, respectively. Heracleous et al. found that it is
extremely difficult to reduce Ni–Mg–O mixed metal oxides.39 They attribute it to the solid solution formed
between NiO and MgO.39 The actual mechanism
will be discussed in the following section.

MgO-modified NiO. The black arrows indicate
the carbon layers generating from the modulation region. The inset
shows the existence of the dislocation within the structure.

Mechanistic Insights on
Carbon Deposition
In the Experimental Methods section, we have shown that
adding MgO to the NiO host is effective for reducing the deposition
of carbon atoms. However, the detailed mechanism is not very well-established
due to the limitation of the in situ observation itself. Therefore,
we employ combined reactive molecular dynamics and density functional
theory (DFT) simulations to reveal the microscopic mechanism of carbon
deposition on MgO-modified NiO. Due to the complexity of the problem,
we first focus on the following two issues: (1) the dynamical process
of carbon shell formation on the Ni metal cluster; (2) the origin
of enhanced structure stability of the NiO host by MgO addition.

To address the first issue, we modeled the carbon atom deposition
process by a two-step process consisting of acetylene decomposition
and carbon atom reduction. In the first step, an acetylene molecule
is pinned near a melted-quenched Ni55 cluster. The whole
system is then gradually heated to 1600 K and equilibrated for 250
ps. The whole decomposition process is shown in Figure 5. The acetylene molecule is first adsorbed
at the Ni cluster surface at t = 0 ps. Then, the
acetylene is decomposed to the pair of separated H–C≡C
group and adsorbed hydrogen atom at t = 64 ps. Then,
the H–C≡C group is further decomposed into a CH group
and a solute C atom. Finally, the acetylene is decomposed into two
solute C atoms and two adsorbed H atoms. The acetylene decomposition
is several orders faster than the carbon shell formation process,
which allows us to model the carbon deposition and reduction processes
without explicitly considering the hydrogen atoms.

Figure 5 Molecular dynamics simulations
of acetylene decomposition on the
Ni55 cluster. The Ni, C, and H atoms are shown as large
green, medium gray, and small white balls, respectively.

For the second step, the reduction process of solute
carbon atoms
is modeled. At first, we model the growth process of the surface carbon
shell by periodically adding carbon atoms to the surface of the Ni
cluster and relaxing the cluster by employing a hybrid MD/MC algorithm.
The relationship between the number of solute C atoms and the number
of total C atoms (N) is shown in Figure 6a. Ten indepedent simulations are performed
to calculate the error bar. The whole process can be divided into
three stages. First, all adsorbed carbon atoms migrate into the Ni
cluster for N ≤ 20 and a Ni–C solution
is formed. When N is more than 20, the number of
solute C atoms remains around 20 and is slightly reduced as N increases. At the same time, formation and growth of the
surface carbon shell proceeds at this stage. It is worth to note that
at the end of the first stage, the molar ratio of Ni/C is in the range
of 3.2–4.2, which is close to the chemical formula of Ni3C. Considering the extra surface Ni atoms, the observed maximum
of the carbon solute number is most likely due to the saturation of
solute carbon atoms. It might be of special interest to determine
whether a crystal-like Ni3C can be found in the core of
the Ni cluster. However, since the Ni cluster is small and exhibits
strong interaction with the carbon shell, the local strain is too
large to preserve the crystal structure. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 6a, the reduction
of the carbon solute is very gentle due to the limited simulation
time at each MD/MC stage. To simulate the long-term effect on the
evolution of the surface carbon shell, one sample of N = 90 is chosen for another long 10 ns simulation at higher temperatures
to accelerate the reduction process. The size and structure evolutions
are shown in Figure 6b,c. After 4 ns, the surface carbon shell reaches a maximum size
of 80 in comparison with the initial size of 70. Then, the shell size
oscillates around 78. Since the growth of the carbon shell is inherently
a rare event, we expect that the Ni/C solute will be fully reduced
to Ni and the carbon shell at lower temperatures and a much longer
time scale, as observed in the aforementioned experiment.

Figure 6 Evolution of
surface and solute carbon atoms. (a) Evolution of
the number of solute carbon atoms (red circles) and the carbon shell
size (blue triangles) with respect to deposited carbon atoms. (b,
c) Long-term evolution of the carbon shell size and local structure
on the Ni cluster. The initial and later incorporated C atoms in the
shell are shown as orange and pink balls and the rest of the C atoms
are shown as gray balls. All Ni atoms are hidden for visualization.

For the detailed process of carbon
shell growth, we tracked the
position of two carbon atoms in an intermediate trajectory for N = 96, as shown in Figure 7. The tracked, network, and other carbon atoms are
shown by yellow, gray, and pink colors, respectively. Initially, the
two carbon atoms are well-separated by Ni atoms and stay on the subsurface
and the surface of the Ni cluster (Figure 7a), respectively. The two atoms then form
a C–C dimer on the cluster surface (Figure 7b,c). As the C–C dimer diffuses on
the cluster surface, it reaches and bonds to a nearby edge site of
the carbon network and extends the original network. To shed light
on the kinetic process of the solute carbon atoms, additional simulation
is performed from the last Ni–C structure without adding new
surface carbon atoms. In Supporting Materials Video 4, we show how a solute carbon atom is gradually decomposing
from the Ni core and extending the carbon shell. Our simulation result
shows that the growth of the surface carbon network can grab carbon
atoms, which dissolute to the cluster surface. As the growth of the
carbon network happens at the edge sites, the reduction of the solute
carbon atoms can be explained by the increased edge sites and the
reduced free surface Ni atoms due to the growth of the carbon network.

dynamics of the surface carbon network: (a) 0 ps, (b) 54.5
ps, (c) 142.5 ps, (d) 206 ps, and (e) final relaxed. The Ni atoms
are shown as green semitransparent balls. The carbon atoms are shown
as small balls with different colors. The yellow-colored ones denote
the tracked atoms. The carbon network is colored dark gray. The other
carbon atoms are colored pink.

To address the second issue, it is well-known that NiO and
MgO
can form a NixMg1–xO solid solution in a wide composition range due
to their similar crystal structures. However, MgO may be segregated
from NiO in reducing atmospheres at high temperatures.40−42 Moreover, our SAED patterns show that the rock salt phase exists
at much higher temperatures for MgO-modified NiO. To provide further
insights into this problem, we first compared the total reduction
energy of MgO and NiO as defined by eq 3 3  where
M stands for Mg or Ni. The computed
reduction energies are 1.53 and 4.15 eV for NiO and MgO, respectively.
Due to the much higher reduction energy of MgO, the reduction of MgO
will not occur under our experimental conditions. To address the effects
of MgO addition on the stability of the NixMg1–xO solid solution, we further
compare the neutral oxygen vacancy (NOV) formation energies of NiO,
MgO, and NixMg1–xO solid solution using a 64-atom supercell. The MgO modification
is modeled by replacing one Ni atom by a Mg atom, resulting in an
MgO concentration of ∼3.1%, which is close to its experimental
value. The NOV formation energy is calculated by eq 4 4  The results are
shown in Figure 8.
The calculated NOV formation
energies are 6.98 and 2.89 eV for MgO and NiO, respectively; thus,
MgO modification might help stabilize the lattice oxygen sites of
the NiO host. By examining the NOV formation energy change at different
oxygen neighbor shells (Figure 8), we found that this is indeed the case: the incorporation
of Mg atoms increases the NOV formation energy from 2.89 to 3.35 eV
for the first neighbor shell, whereas an increase of 0.1 eV is observed
for all other oxygen sites. Due to the enhanced thermodynamic barrier,
the MgO-modified NiO is less reducible than pristine NiO, which explains
our previous experimental observation.

Figure 8 NOV formation energies
at different oxygen sites in NiO, MgO, and
NixMg1–xO hosts.

In short, we show that on the
Ni metal surface, it is easy to form
the Ni–C complex and the surface carbon shell under specified
conditions. Apparently, the dynamic movement process of the solute
carbon atom can be tracked by MD simulation in detail. The reason
for the reduced carbon deposition by MgO incorporation is due to the
enhanced oxygen site stability near the Mg defect centers.

Conclusions
In summary, in situ transmission electron microscopy reveals that
the carbon deposition originates from the decomposition of the intermediate-phase
Ni3C. The modification of MgO on the NiO particle can effectively
decrease the formation of graphitic layers and thus enhance the catalytic
performance of NiO. This is the first experimental evidence of carbon
formation originating from the decomposition of carbide by in situ
TEM observation. Reactive molecular dynamics simulations clarify that
the carbon deposition process involves acetylene decomposition and
carbon atom reduction processes. DFT calculations show that the incorporation
of MgO in the NiO host forms the NixMg1–xO solid solution at high temperatures,
which helps stabilize the lattice oxygen sites and decreases the reduced
Ni metal sites and carbon decomposition.
