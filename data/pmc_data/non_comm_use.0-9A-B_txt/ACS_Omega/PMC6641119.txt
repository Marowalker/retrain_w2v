CuI-catalyzed cycloaddition
(CA) of the ketonitrones,
Ph2C=N+(R′)O– (R′ = Me, CH2Ph), to the disubstituted cyanamides,
NCNR2 (R = Me2, Et2, (CH2)4, (CH2)5, (CH2)4O, C9H10, (CH2Ph)2, Ph(Me)), gives the corresponding 5-amino-substituted 2,3-dihydro-1,2,4-oxadiazoles
(15 examples) in good to moderate yields. The reaction proceeds under
mild conditions (CH2Cl2, RT or 45 °C) and
requires 10 mol % of [Cu(NCMe)4](BF4) as the
catalyst. The somewhat reduced yields are due to the individual properties
of 2,3-dihydro-1,2,4-oxadiazoles, which easily undergo ring opening
via N—O bond splitting. Results of density functional theory
calculations reveal that the CA of ketonitrones to CuI-bound
cyanamides is a concerted process, and the copper-catalyzed reaction
is controlled by the predominant contribution of the HOMOdipole–LUMOdipolarophile interaction (group I by Sustmann’s
classification). The metal-involving process is much more asynchronous
and profitable from both kinetic and thermodynamic viewpoints than
the hypothetical metal-free reaction.

Introduction
Although 2,3-dihydro-1,2,4-oxadiazoles1 (DHODs; Scheme 1)
are relevant to 1,2,4-oxadiazoles with broad application of the latter
in material and medicinal chemistry,2 it
is still an almost unexplored class of heterocyclic systems because
synthetic routes to DHODs are poorly elaborated. In the context of
known DHOD properties, platinum(II) species featuring ligated DHODs
are of biological importance, exhibiting antitumor properties.3 In addition, NR2 substituents in 5-amino-substituted
DHODs could be potentially considered as a useful tool for design
of bioisosteres (e.g., carboxylic acid, amide, and esters) based on
this type of heterocycles.4 Hence, novel
synthetic approaches to DHODs warrant investigation.

Scheme 1 Metal-Free
(Left) and Metal-Mediated (Right) Synthetic Approaches
to 2,3-Dihydro-1,2,4-oxadiazoles
The first group of reactions leading to DHODs includes
metal-free
cycloaddition (CA) of nitrones to nitriles (Scheme 1, A), and this reaction proceeds under harsh
conditions.1b,1c,5 Although
this atom-economic method is perhaps the simplest route to obtain
DHODs, it is restricted exclusively to electron-deficient nitriles
bearing strong acceptor substituents, such as CCl3, and
it also utilizes quite reactive nitrones. The reaction of nitriles
employing oxaziridines (B), which serve as a hidden and reactive form
of nitrones, allows high-yield syntheses of DHODs, but even these
reactions involve only rather electron-deficient nitriles, in particular,
those with R = Ar.6 CA between oxazol-5-ones
and nitrosobenzene gives 3-carboxylic-substituted DHODs (R3 = CO2H) (C).7

Another
group of reactions leading to DHODs utilizes metal centers
to promote CA of nitrones to nitriles (Scheme 1, right). Metal-mediated processes gradually
lose their initial popularity because metals serve as a potential
toxic waste source. However, in many instances, metal-involving syntheses
(particularly metal-catalyzed) are still preferred over relevant metal-free
routes because metal centers could strongly activate reactants and/or
substantially reduce the number of steps leading to target compounds.
These metal-involving methods were applied for generation of DHODs,
and it appeared that some metals act as efficient activators of RCN
dipolarophiles in the CA (D).8 The preparation
of metal-free DHODs via routes (D)–(E) requires an additional
step (E) of ligand liberation.1d,8a−8i,9 This method (D–E), despite
its generality, employs rather expensive platinum and palladium species.

Recently, we have demonstrated (F) that disubstituted cyanamides,
N≡CNRR′, being coordinated to a ZnII center,
can be employed in the CA with acyclic N-alkyl ketonitrones
Ph2C=N+(O–)R′
(R′ = Me, CH2Ph), and this reaction proceeds easily
achieving the respective metal-free heterocycles.10 We succeeded in replacing platinum and palladium in the
CA with more favorable zinc(II), but the developed method employs
stoichiometric rather than catalytic amounts of Zn(OTf)2.

Although CA with stoichiometric amounts of cheap zinc is
an obvious
development in the generation of DHODs, our goal was to find a catalytic
system for the CA and synthesis of these heterocycles. At first glance,
this task may seem simple, but it proves surprisingly challenging
as the dominant part of useful catalytic systems utilizes Pearson’s
“hard” metal centers.

These centers, in turn,
preferably coordinate with the hard oxygen
center of nitrones, thus blocking these dipoles toward the CA, and
also promote nitrone hydrolytic and/or deoxygenation decomposition
(Scheme 2).8d,11

Scheme 2 Metal-Mediated Reactions of Nitrones
Taking into account our general interest in metal-mediated
reactions
of substrates bearing a CN triple bond (for our reviews, see refs (9c) and (12)) and, in particular, in
their metal-catalyzed organic transformations (for recent works, see
ref (13)), we focused
our efforts on the search for a practically useful catalytic system
for generation of DHODs. After many unsuccessful attempts, we found
that copper(I) exhibits catalytic properties in the CAs of ketonitrones
to push–pull nitriles, such as cyanamides, giving 5-amino-substituted
DHODs, and all our results disclosing the first catalytic system for
generation of DHOD’s are consistently disclosed in sections
that follow.

Results and Discussion
Copper(I)-Catalyzed CA
of Ketonitrones to Cyanamides
Optimization of the Catalytic System and
Reaction Conditions
Initially, dimethylcyanamide and N-(diphenylmethylene)methanamine
oxide, Ph2C=N+(Me)O–, were addressed as model substrates for optimization of the reaction
conditions. Our variations included choice of copper species, load
of catalyst, solvents, time, and reaction temperatures. The results
are summarized in Table S1 (see the Supporting Information).

We tested copper(I
and II) species, namely, [Cu(NCMe)4](BF4) and
Cu(OTf)2 (Table S1, entry 15),
which are soluble in the used organic solvents. The complex [Cu(NCMe)4](BF4) was found to be the best choice, and no
reaction occurred without copper species (Table S1, entries 1, 2, and 14). Variation of load of catalyst (Table S1, entries 3–6) revealed that the
highest yield was obtained when 10 mol % of [Cu(NCMe)4](BF4) was employed. The lowering of the yield of 1 upon decreasing the load of catalyst is probably due to decreased
concentration of activated substrates. More unusual is the yield reduction
upon increasing the load of catalyst above 10 mol %. This phenomenon
can be rationalized by the occurrence of some side reactions at a
higher catalyst concentration, for instance, CuI-mediated
reduction of the ketonitrone. The reaction proceeds in the temperature
range from 20 to 80 °C (Table S1,
entries 7–11 and 17, in CH2Cl2 or toluene),
and increasing the temperature leads to an enhancement of the reaction
rate. Effects of concentration (Table S1, entry 12) and microwave irradiation (Table S1, entries 13 and 14) were also studied, but they only slightly
affected the reaction rate. The yield was decreased when dimethylcyanamide
was taken in 10-fold excess compared with the nitrone (Table S1, entry 16), and the optimal molar ratio
between these substrates is 1:1. We believe that a large excess of
NCNMe2 could lead to transformation of the copper catalyst
to its less active form. Solvent variation was studied for the system
Ph2C=N+(Me)O–:NCNMe2 in the presence of 10 mol % of the copper(I) catalyst (Table S1, entries 4 and 18–22). The yields
of 1 are based on NMR integration with 1,4-dimethoxybenzene
taken as an internal standard. Only a small increase in the yield
of 1 (from 60 to 68%) upon increasing the reaction time
from 2 to 24 h (Table S1, entries 4 and
8–11) is probably explained by the consumption of the catalyst
in the reaction. In summary, the results of these preliminary tests
demonstrate that the optimal conditions for the model reaction include
[Cu(NCMe)4](BF4) (10 mol %), molar ratio between
the reactants 1:1, temperature 45 °C and application of CH2Cl2 as the solvent. The order of addition of the
reactants is important, and the highest yield (68%; 45 °C, 24
h) of 1 was achieved when NCNMe2 was added
to a solution of [Cu(NCMe)4](BF4) followed by
addition of Ph2C=N+(Me)O–. If the ketonitrone was added to a solution of the catalyst followed
by addition of dimethylcyanamide, the yield of the target heterocycle
was substantially lower (ca. 10%). This behavior could be explained
taking into account the competition of the ketonitrone and NCNMe2 for the copper(I) coordination site. We studied the reaction
of ketonitrones with CuI in a separate experiment and found
that their interaction leads to oxidation of copper(I) and coordination
of the nitrone O atom followed by decomposition of the complexes thus
formed (see later). Hence, a combination of coordinated dimethylcyanamide
and free dipole leads to the CA;1a,14 therefore,
the order of reactant addition indicated above is preferable. Our
theoretical calculations (see later) agree with the experimental data
and they support group I by Sustmann’s classification15 of CA.

Substrate Variation
As the next step, we extended the
scope of the substrate to various disubstituted cyanamides and two
aryl ketonitrones (Scheme 3), and the obtained results are summarized in Table 1.

a We were unable to isolate the cycloadduct
when the reaction was carried out under standard conditions (2 h,
45 °C); upon prolonged treatment (24 h, 45 °C) under harsh
conditions (MW irradiation, 100 °C, 30 min), we only observed
peaks corresponding to the cycloadduct in HRESI+-MS of
the reaction mixture.

For
most combinations of cyanamides and ketonitrones, the corresponding
2,3-dihydro-1,2,4-oxadiazoles were obtained and isolated in 28–73%
yields. In all reaction mixtures, unreacted ketonitrone was identified,
and this reflects an incomplete conversion of substrates. The target
product was not isolated for the NCNR2/Ph2C=N+(CH2Ph)O– (R = Me, Et) systems,
whereas signals corresponding to 4 were determined by
HRESI+-MS monitoring of the reaction mixtures. Product 4 was not obtained, probably due to steric restriction of
the NEt2 group that prevents cyanamide–nitrone CA.

When the reaction with conventional nitriles RCN (R = Me, Ph, 4-Cl-C6H4, 4-CF3C6H4)
was attempted under the same conditions (Ph2C=N+(Me)O–, 10 mol % [Cu(NCMe)4](BF4), CH2Cl2, 45 °C), no CA products
were detected in the reaction mixture after 2 days. This observation
additionally demonstrates the greater reactivity of cyanamides toward
CA as compared to that of conventional nitriles; this trend was highlighted
previously in our review.1a Aldonitrone,
4-MeC6H4CH=N+(Me)O–, did not react with NCNMe2 under the reaction conditions
(10 mol % [Cu(NCMe)4](BF4), CH2Cl2, 45 °C, 2 days), which additionally confirmed the previously
established greater reactivity of C,C-diaryl ketonitrones than that of C-aryl aldonitrones.8b The higher reactivity of ketonitrones is related
to the different electronic effect of phenyl groups in aldo- and ketonitrones.
In aldonitrones, the aromatic substituent at the C atom is involved
in the conjugation and acts as an electron-acceptor substituent, decreasing
the reactivity of the 1,3-dipoles. In C,C-diaryl ketonitrones, both aromatic substituents are out of the C=NO
plane and are not involved in the conjugation and therefore, could
not act as electron acceptors.

2,3-Dihydro-1,2,4-oxadiazoles
are unstable in the presence of copper(I),
and heating of 1 with [Cu(NCMe)4](BF4) (50 mol %; nitromethane, 70 °C, 2 h) leads to almost complete
decomposition of the heterocycle and formation of a mixture of benzophenone
(isolated yield 25%) and 3-(diphenylmethylene)-1,1-dimethylurea (isolated
yield 56%) (Scheme 4); these species are probably derived from the known10 2,3-dihydo-1,2,4-oxadiazole ring opening. Heterocycle 1 remains intact under the same conditions in the absence
of the copper(I) complex.

Scheme 4 Copper(I)-Mediated Decomposition of the
Heterocycle
The observed metal-mediated
ring opening of 2,3-dihydro-1,2,4-oxadiazoles
explains the moderate isolated yields of these heterocycles.

Characterization of 6 and 8–16
Heterocycles 1–3, 5, and 7 were identified by comparison
of their 1H NMR and high-resolution ESI+-MS
spectra with those known from the literature.10 New heterocycles 6, 8–16 were characterized by elemental analyses (C, H, N), HRESI+-MS, 1H and 13C{1H} NMR, Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR), and also by X-ray diffraction (for 9, 12, and 16). Heterocycle 4 was not isolated from the reaction mixture due to low yield
and was identified by HRESI+-MS in the reaction mixtures
(m/z: 386.2246 [M + H]+, calcd 386.2227). Compounds 6 and 8–16 give satisfactory C, H, and N elemental analyses for the
proposed formulas. The HRESI+-MS of these species exhibit
peaks corresponding to [M + H]+. The FTIR spectra of all
complexes display the ν(C=N) bands in the range 1655–1660
cm–1, which is specific for relevant DHODs.8c,16 The protons of the N-methyl group of 9, 11, 13, and 15 appeared
as a singlet in the interval 2.33–2.49 ppm; the methylene protons
(NCH2Ph) of 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 appear as a singlet located between 3.37 and 3.64 ppm. The 13C{1H} NMR spectra display resonances in the interval
94.7–96.0 ppm corresponding to the quaternary C3 atoms of the heterocycles and signals at 158.0–160.6 ppm
attributed to the C5 atom from the C=N moiety. In
the 13C{1H} NMR spectra, the peaks from the
CPh2 moiety emerge as one broad singlet due to a dynamic
process.

Heterocycles 9, 12, and 16 were characterized by X-ray crystallography (Figures 1, S1, and S2, see the Supporting Information). Bond distances and
angles for these structures are close to those in the previously reported
structures of DHODs (Table S2).10

Generation of Nitrone Complexes
[Cu{ON(R′′)CPh2}4](BF4)2 (17)
If the reaction of copper(I)
centers with nitriles are
well known,17 those of nitrones are poorly
studied. Copper(II) nitrone complexes documented in the literature
feature bidentately coordinated ligands with the nitrone moiety18 and the monodentate 2,5,5-trimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide.18c

For a deeper
understanding of the copper(I)-catalyzed CA, we studied the reaction
between the nitrone dipoles Ph2C=N+(O–)R″ (R″ = Me, CH2Ph) and [Cu(NCMe)4](BF4). Four equivalents of any one of the nitrones
were added to [Cu(NCMe)4](BF4) in CH2Cl2 and the reaction mixture was stirred at RT. HRESI+-MS monitoring of the reaction mixture after 24 h allows the
identification of peaks corresponding to the fragment ions, namely,
[MCl(nitrone)2]+, [MCl(nitrone)3]+, and [M(nitrone)2]+. IR monitoring
of the reaction mixture allowed the observation of the C=N
stretching bands of the (nitrone)CuI complexes at ca. 1660
cm–1 (R″ = Me, Ph), whereas the uncomplexed
nitrones Ph2C=N+(O–)R″ (R = Me, Ph) exhibit a medium-to-weak band at ca. 1530–1520
cm–1 of the CCAr and/or C=N stretches.19 The resulting mixture was diluted with hexane
and concentrated in vacuo at RT giving a dark greenish oily residue
that, on the next day, solidified furnishing a few black needle-like
crystals (R″ = Me) that were studied by X-ray diffraction (17; Figure 2; for description of the X-ray structure, see the SI).

90.54(4), Cu1O1N1 118.10(7), O1N1C2 123.00(11).

Moreover, we also found that the nitrones are unstable in
the presence
of a catalytic amount of the copper(I) complex. The heating of Ph2C=N+(O–)Me with [Cu(NCMe)4](BF4) (10 mol %) under optimized conditions (45
°C, 2 h) leads to a partial hydrolytic decomposition of the dipole
giving benzophenone Ph2C=O (preparative yield 22%).

Thus, upon treatment of ketonitrones with CuI we observed
that the reactant interplay leads to oxidation of copper(I) and a
broad spectrum of products. In the context of the copper(I)-catalyzed
CA, these synthetic experiments give an idea that the generation of
2,3-dihydro-1,2,4-oxadiazoles is likely to proceed via ligation of
the nitriles to the CuI center, followed by the reaction
of the metal-bound dipolarophiles with the nitrones. This assumption
is fully supported by theoretical calculations whose results are presented
below.

Theoretical Study of the CuI-Catalyzed CA of Ketonitrones
to Cyanamides
To understand the mechanism of the copper-catalyzed
CA of ketonitrones to cyanamides we have carried out quantum-chemical
calculations at the density functional theory (DFT) level of theory
of model CA of Me2C=N+(Me)O– to uncomplexed and copper-bound NCNMe2. We have successfully
used this approach in studies of similar metal-assisted and metal-free
1,3-dipolar CA reactions of nitrones to isocyanides20 and nitriles,21 and metal-assisted
coupling of oximes and nitriles.22

We proposed three types of mechanisms for CA of Me2C=N+(Me)O– to NCNMe2, two of them
are stepwise (Scheme 5 A,C) and the third is concerted (B). CA is initiated by the endoergonic
formation of the orientation complex OC (+4.2 and +2.3
kcal/mol for metal-free and CuI-catalyzed reactions, respectively).
Stepwise pathways involve the formation of acyclic zwitterionic intermediates INTa or INTb (via TSs1a or TSs1b), which then undergo the cyclization (via TSs2a or TSs2b, respectively) giving the cyclic product P, whereas the concerted CA proceeds via a cyclic transition
state (TSc). For both metal-free and metal-involving
processes no minima for structures corresponding to any acyclic intermediates
were located upon a detailed search for the potential energy surface.
Despite numerous attempts, in all cases, optimization led to the formation
of initial species, which are separated from each other, or to product P. Thus, stepwise pathways have been excluded from consideration.
On the other hand, the TSc structures, corresponding
to concerted CA, were successfully found for both metal-free and metal-involving
reactions (TScfree and TScCu, respectively). The cyclic nature
of these transition states (TSs) has been confirmed by the topological
analysis of the electron density distribution within the formalism
of the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) method23 (we successfully used this approach in studies
of noncovalent interactions and properties of coordination bonds in
various transition metal complexes20,24).

Scheme 5 Proposed
Mechanisms for the CA
The Poincare–Hopf relation in both cases is satisfied,
thus
all critical points have been found. The contour line diagrams of
the Laplacian distribution ∇2ρ(r), bond paths, and selected zero-flux surfaces are shown in Figure S48. The ring critical point (3, +1) for
the 2,3-dihydro-1,2,4-oxadiazole cycle and five suitable bond critical
points (3, −1; BCPs) were determined. For TScCu, the electron density value ρ(r) at the O···Ccyanamide BCP is significantly
higher than that at the Cnitrone···Ncyanamide BCP, but for TScfree, these parameters at both BCPs are comparable (Table S4). The energy density Hb at
the O···Ccyanamide and Cnitrone···Ncyanamide BCPs in TScfree and at O···Ccyanamide BCP in TScCu is clearly negative
demonstrating some covalent contribution in these interactions, whereas
Hb at the Cnitrone···Ncyanamide BCP in TScCu is virtually zero
and hence, no covalent contribution in this contact was detected.
These observations reveal that the concerted metal-involving CA reaction
is significantly more asynchronous as compared to the metal-free process,
which is consistent with the general trend: coordination of a Lewis
acid to any reactant leads to substantial decreasing of the reaction
synchronicity [CA of nitrones to the C≡N bond: refs (1a, 20, 21, 24d, 25); CA of nitrones to
the C=C bond: ref (26)]. Indeed, appropriate Sy parameters (quantitative measure of the synchronicity of concerted
CAs proposed by Moyano et al.27) are 0.68
for metal-involving CA versus 0.93 for metal-free CA. Inspection of
the calculated activation and reaction energies (Figure 3, Table S6) indicates, first, that the activation barrier for the Cu-catalyzed
CA is significantly lower than that for the metal-free coupling (by
5.4 kcal/mol in terms of Gibbs free energies in solution). Second,
metal-involving process is more preferably from a thermodynamic viewpoint.

Figure 3 Energy
profiles for metal-free (blue) and metal-involving (red)
processes.

An interaction between the frontier
MOs of the reactants is the
driving force of CA reactions. Our calculations indicate that the
CA reaction of Me2C=N+(Me)O– to free NCNMe2 belongs to group II processes in the Sustman
classification (energy gaps between HOMOdipole–LUMOdipolarophile and HOMOdipolarophile–LUMOdipole are 0.26 and 0.25 au, respectively, see Figure 4).

Figure 4 Energies of the interacting
frontier MOs of Me2C=N+(Me)O– and uncomplexed or Cu-bound NCNMe2.

The coordination of NCNMe2 to the copper(I) metal
center
results in a decrease of both HOMOπ(C≡N) and
LUMOπ*(C≡N) energies and leads to significant contraction of the HOMOdipole–LUMOdipolarophile energy gap and expansion of
the HOMOdipolarophile–LUMOdipole energy
gap. Thus, the simple qualitative MO consideration suggests that (i)
the coordination of NCNMe2 should accelerate the nitrone
CA and (ii) the metal-involving CA belongs to normal electron demand
processes (group I by Sustmann’s classification).

Literature
data confirm our observations and, indeed, CAs of nitrones
often belong to group II reactions,28 but
it is easily possible to change the type of reaction by the variation
of substituents in the reactants or its coordination to the metal
center. Thus, CA of nitrones to electron-deficient dipolarophiles
(namely, acrylonitrile,29 acrolein,30 methyl propiolate,31 methyl acrylate,32 nitroalkenes,33 fluoroalkenes, and fluoroalkynes34) as well as metal-involving processes35 is determined by the interaction of HOMOdipole–LUMOdipolarophile (group I, normal
electron demand reactions), whereas usage of dipolarophiles with electron-donating
substituents (e.g., methyl vinyl ether)26a leads to switching of the type of reaction to inverse electron demand
(HOMOdipolarophile–LUMOdipole, group
III by Sustmann’s classification).

Concluding Remarks
We found a novel synthetic approach to 2,3-dihydro-1,2,4-oxadiazoles
that includes CuI-catalyzed CA of ketonitrones to disubstituted
cyanamides and gives 5-amino-substituted ring systems. The reaction
proceeds under mild conditions (RT or 45 °C) and requires 10
mol % of [Cu(NCMe)4](BF4) as the catalyst. The
application of the developed method furnishes the heterocycles in
good to moderate yields. The somewhat reduced yields are due to the
individual properties of 2,3-dihydro-1,2,4-oxadiazoles, which easily
undergo ring opening via the N—O bond splitting.

All
previous approaches to 2,3-dihydro-1,2,4-oxadiazoles bearing
donor substituents at the fifth position of the ring were based on
the usage of stoichiometric amounts of activating metal centers (ZnII, PtII, PdII, or PtIV) and
these methods included a two-step procedure followed by (for platinum
and palladium) conventional recycling of these expensive metals. The
discovery of a simple catalytic system for generation of 2,3-dihydro-1,2,4-oxadiazoles
is certainly a step toward sustainable synthesis of this yet unexplored
class of heterocycles.

Inspection of our experimental data indicates
that the combination
of coordinated cyanamide dipolarophile and uncomplexed nitrone dipole,
not vice versa, leads to the CA. Theoretical calculations are agreeable
with this conclusion. Results of the DFT calculations reveal that
the CA of ketonitrones to CuI-bound cyanamides is a concerted
process and the copper-catalyzed reaction is controlled by the predominant
contribution of the HOMOdipole–LUMOdipolarophile interaction (group I by Sustmann’s classification). The metal-involving
process is much more asynchronous and favorable from both kinetic
and thermodynamic viewpoints than the hypothetical metal-free reaction.

were measured using a Bruker Avance III 400/100 MHz spectrometer at
ambient temperature.

X-ray Structure Determinations
Crystals
of 9, 12, 16, and 17 were measured
on a Agilent Technologies SuperNova diffractometer at a temperature
of 100 K using monochromated Cu Kα radiation. All structures
were solved by direct methods by means of the SHELX program39 incorporated into the OLEX2 program package.40 For crystallographic data and refinement parameters,
see Table S3. The carbon-bound H atoms
were placed in calculated positions and were included in the refinement
in the “riding” model approximation, with Uiso(H) set to 1.5Ueq(C) and
C—H 0.98 Å for CH3 groups, with Uiso(H) set to 1.2Ueq(C) and
C—H 0.99 Å for CH2 groups, and with Uiso(H) set to 1.2Ueq(C) and C—H 0.95 Å for CH groups. Empirical absorption
correction was applied in the CrysAlisPro41 program complex using spherical harmonics, implemented in the SCALE3
ABSPACK scaling algorithm. Supporting crystallographic data for this
article have been deposited at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data
Centre (CCDC 1456546, 1456547, 1470262, 1468157) and can be obtained

Computational Details
The full geometry optimization
of all structures and TSs has been carried out at the DFT level of
theory using the M06 functional42 with
the help of the Gaussian-0943 program package.
No symmetry operations have been applied. The calculations were carried
out using the multielectron fit fully relativistic energy-consistent
pseudopotential MDF10 of the Stuttgart/Cologne group that described
10 core electrons and the appropriate contracted basis set for the
copper atom44 and the 6-31G(d) basis set
for other atoms. The Hessian matrix was calculated analytically for
the optimized structures to prove the location of correct minima (no
imaginary frequencies) or saddle points (only one imaginary frequency)
and to estimate the thermodynamic parameters, the latter being calculated
at 25 °C. The nature of all TSs was studied by the analysis of
vectors associated with the imaginary frequency and by calculations
of the intrinsic reaction coordinates using the Gonzalez–Schlegel
method.45

The total energies corrected
for solvent effects (Es) were estimated
by single-point calculations on the basis of equilibrium gas-phase
geometries at the same level of theory using the SMD continuum solvation
model by Truhlar and co-workers46 with
CH2Cl2 as the solvent. The entropic term in
CH2Cl2 solution (Ss) was calculated according to the procedure described by Wertz47 and Cooper and Ziegler48 using eqs 1–4 1   2   3   4  where Sg is the
gas-phase entropy of the solute, ΔSsol is the solvation entropy, S°,sliq, S°,sgas, and Vsm,liq are the standard entropies
and molar volume of the solvent in liquid or gas phases (173.84 and
270.28 J/mol K and 64.15 mL/mol, respectively, for CH2Cl2), Vm,gas is the molar volume
of ideal gas at 25 °C (24 450 mL/mol), V°m is the molar volume of the solution corresponding
to the standard conditions (1000 mL/mol).

The enthalpies and
Gibbs free energies in solution (Hs and Gs) were estimated by
using expressions 5 and 6 5   6  where Es, Eg, and Hg are the
total energies in solution and in the gas phase and gas-phase enthalpy,
respectively.

A topological analysis of the electron density
distribution with
the help of the QTAIM formalism developed by Bader23 has been performed using the Multiwfn program (version
3.3.4).49 The Wiberg bond indices were
computed using the natural bond orbital partitioning scheme.50

The synchronicity of concerted CAs (Sy)27 was calculated using eqs 7–9 7  where n is the number
of
bonds directly involved in the reaction (n = 5 for
1,3-dipolar CAs) and δBi is the relative variation of a given Wiberg bond index Bi at the TS relative to reactants
(R) and products (P), and it is calculated as 8  If the δBi value is negative, it is assumed to be zero. The
average value of δBi (δBav) is defined as 9  Sy is 0 for stepwise CAs and is 1 for the fully concerted reactions.

The Cartesian atomic coordinates of the calculated equilibrium
structures are presented in the Table S7.

Synthetic Work
CuI-Catalyzed Synthesis of 2,3-Dihydro-1,2,4-oxadiazoles
A solution of any one of NCNR2 (0.473 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (2 mL) was added to solid [Cu(NCMe)4](BF4) (15 mg, 0.047 mmol), and the formed mixture was
stirred for 5 min for homogenization, whereupon Ph2C=N+(O–)R′ (0.473 mmol; R = Me, 100 mg;
CH2Ph 0.135 mg) was added, and the formed reaction mixture
was stirred under conditions given in Table S1. The reaction mixture was subjected to chromatographic separation
on silica gel. Heterocycles 1–16 were
isolated from the first fraction (the fractions were identified by
TLC on Merck 60 F254 plates under UV light; hexane/EtOAc 10:1, v/v);
unreacted nitrone was isolated from further fractions eluted by EtOAc/hexane
1:2 → pure EtOAc (5–15% recovered). Previously reported1 heterocycles 1–3, 5, and 7 were identified by comparison of their 1H NMR, HRESI+-MS, and TLCs with those of the known
species. Full characterization of novel 2,3-dihydro-1,2,4-oxadiazoles
is given below.
