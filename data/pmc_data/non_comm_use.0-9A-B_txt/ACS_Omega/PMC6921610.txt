Poly(vinylamine) (PVAm) is an important polymer with
the highest
content of primary amine groups of any polymer. PVAm has a great potential
in selective separation and smart materials. It is difficult to fabricate
pure PVAm nanofibers by electrospinning and rotary jet spinning (RJS)
without additional polymers. In this work, rotary jet wet spinning
(RJWS) was applied to fabricate molecular imprinting nanofibers (MINFs)
with polyelectrolyte for the first time. Initially, optimal parameters
of spinning are investigated, including coagulation bath, solution
viscosity, and rotation speed. The PVAm aqueous solution is sensitive
to alcohol. To demonstrate RJWS application, PVAm-based MINFs for
bisphenol A (one endocrine disruptor) recognition are prepared by
adding dummy template, cross-linking, and template elution. The association
constant (8.6 mg/L), equilibrium time (30 min), and binding sites
utilization rate (80%) of MINFs are evaluated. Its adsorption amount
and selectivity are little lower than those of MIPs prepared by bulk
polymerization; however, its adsorption speed is faster than that
of MIPs.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Many important functional
polymers with high content of amine groups,
such as poly(vinylamine) (PVAm),1 poly(ethylenimine)
(PEI), poly(allylamine) (PAH), and chitosan, are widely applied in
biomedical,2 toxic heavy metal removal,3 chemical sensors,4 and so on. Specially, PVAm polymer, with the highest content of
primary amine groups of any polymers, possesses good polyelectrolyte
effects.1 Its mixed membranes have been
applied to CO2 filtration,5−7 water/ethanol separation,8,9 and so on. Engineering the functional polymers into nanofiber materials
can further greatly enhance their selectivity of adsorption, separation,
penetration efficiency, and filtration. In the literatures published
during the last 13 years, nanofibers of these functional polymers
were only fabricated by electrospinning (ES) with expensive volatile
solvents and additional polymers.10−14 Only PVAm nanofibers have not been fabricated by
ES or rotary jet spinning (RJS), which is high rate production spinning
with centrifugal force.15,16

According to
the newest reviews of rotary jet spinning reported
by Rogalski et al.17 and Chen et al.,18 most rotary jet spinning methods reported can
be categorized to rotary jet dry spinning or rotary jet melt spinning.
This mechanism of fiber formation has been comprehensively demonstrated.15,19−25 The primary challenges of pure PVAm nanofiber fabrication include
(1) the difficulty to find volatile solvents to fit ES and RJS; because
of its high viscoelasticity and hydrophilicity of PVAm aqueous solution,
water cannot evaporate rapidly to form nanofibers; (2) the limited
choice of coagulation bath in wet spinning; and (3) specific viscosity
regulation.

Kevin Kit Parker’s group in Harvard University
recognized
that the high reliance on volatile carrier solvents was the disadvantage
of dry RJS; thus, they developed immersion rotary jet spinning (iRJS)
in 2016.26 The iRJS increases uniformity
of nanofiber’s diameter, but it may be difficult to draw thinner
fiber when fibers immerse into precipitation bath too early and difficult
to fabricate nanofiber membrane with bigger area. Conventional RJS,
rotary jet wet spinning (RJWS), and iRJS are three important pieces
of puzzle in functional polymeric nanofibers fabrication. To address
these challenges, we developed rotary jet wet spinning (RJWS) for
the fabrication of pure polyelectrolyte polymeric nanofiber membrane.
The spinning technique was applied for Chinese patent in 2015, and
issued patent certificate in 2019. RJWS will further promote the industrial
application of rotary jet spinning.

In this work, the optimal
parameters of pure PVAm nanofibers fabrication
are investigated. Then, to demonstrate the practical application,
the optimal process is applied to spin molecular imprinting nanofibers
(MINFs) for bisphenol A (BPA) recognition, one of the endocrine disruptors
and acutely toxic to aquatic organisms.27 Molecular imprinting material was first developed by Wulff and Sarhan.28 Now the technique becomes one of the most versatile
methods for the fabrication of molecular recognition materials29 and is applied to the development of material
nanoarchitectonics.30 In this work, cross-linking
between PVAm and glutaraldehyde (GA) is carried out after assembling
between dummy template and PVAm. Following that, the specific binding
sites are generated after dummy template is eluted. The leakage of
toxic template can be avoided by using dummy template to take palace
of the BPA template. Because phenol red possesses two flexible phenol
structures similar to BPA and possesses very high aqueous solubility,
it may be a good dummy template for BPA in aqueous preparation systems.
The adsorption properties and selectivity of the resulted MINFs for
BPA against its analogues are evaluated in spiked standard water and
real river water with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
system. Rotary jet spinning technique was first applied to the fabrication
of molecular imprinting nanofibers. In comparison with other works
of molecular imprinting nanofibers fabricated by ES and molecular
imprinting particles (MIPs) prepared by bulk polymerization, the adsorption
equilibrium of MINFs for BPA solution at low concentration was reached
in 30 min, similar to other nanofiber material fabricated by ES;31 in addition, in this work, it is not
necessary to synthesize uniform nanosize molecular imprinting particles
prior to spinning molecular imprinting nanofibers, choose a volatile
solvent, and worry about the leakage of residual template32,33 with the combination of RJS and dummy molecular imprinting (DMI).

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Optimizing PVAm Nanofiber Fabrication
2.1.1 Morphology of PVAm Nanofiber
Figure 1 shows that the smallest
diameter of PVAm nanofibers vary as spun speed increases from 6000,
8000 to 12 000 rpm with 8 wt % concentration. They are about
500 nm (Figure 1a),
260 nm (Figure 1b),
and 320 nm (Figure 1c), respectively. With different rotation speeds, their median diameters
are 1673 ± 345, 1273 ± 212, and 734 ±276 nm, respectively
(see Supporting Information Figures S4–S6). From 6000 to 8000 rpm, the uniformity of PVAm nanofibers diameter
becomes better; but from 8000 to 12 000 rpm, it turns bad.
The best uniformity of PVAm nanofibers diameter is achieved at 8000
rpm with 8 wt % concentration. Other parameters are as follows: orifice
distance and diameter are 1.0 and 0.4 mm, respectively, and coagulation
bath is ethanol. In comparison with other works, the uniformity of
the resulted superfine fibers fabricated by rotary jet wet spinning
is lower than that of those fabricated by rotary jet dry spinning.

Figure 1 Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images of smallest PVAm nanofibers
spun at different speeds: (a) 6000 rpm, 8 wt %; (b) 8000 rpm, 8 wt
%; (c) 12 000 rpm, 8 wt %; and (d) 12 000 rpm, 12 wt
%. (e) One segment of (d) and the fiber with smallest diameter.

A very interesting phenomenon is observed that
regularly spaced
large and small section stay in a line along the fiber direction,
forming a L–M–L–M structure (Figure 2d). The special phenomenon,
named capillary wavelength, is discussed in detail by Wang et al.34 In this work, capillary wavelength is 6–10
times the fiber diameter, larger than their results (3.15 times);
the dominant mode may be the long-wave mode.Figure 1d shows the critical balance status of the
interaction between the centrifugal force and the surface tension
of the viscoelastic PVAm solution is frozen. It is obvious that the
smallest diameter of PVAm nanofiber with capillary wavelength is about
50 nm (Figure 1e),
confirming the generation of smallest nanofibers reported by Badrossamay
et al.15 It may indicate the low limit
of the nanofiber diameter fabricated by rotary jet spinning. In addition,
to prevent the superfine fibers from shrinking, a metal filter (200–300
mesh) is laid on the coagulation bath to adhere the ultrafine fibers
firmly and keep their diameter stable during the spinning process,
resulting in gaining real nanometric size dimension at various fabricated
parameters.

Figure 2 Effect of different concentrations on the specific viscosity of
PVAm solution spun at 8000 rpm with ethanol as the coagulation liquid.

The crystallinity of PVAm nanofibers is very low,
and there are
no obvious crystallization peaks in their X-ray diffraction (XRD)
spectra, indicating that most of PVAm molecules exist in amorphous
form (see Supporting Information Figure S7).

2.1.2 Coagulation Bath
Coagulation bath
characteristics are very crucial to the formation of nanofiber in
wet spinning. PVAm’s strong hydrophilicity hinders water to
evaporate rapidly from the solution and fiber to generate during dry
spinning. Several polar solvents are investigated as coagulation baths.
Their spinning performance follows the ranking methanol ≥ ethanol>
N-propanol > isopropanol > dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). If isopropanol
is chosen as a coagulation bath, all fibers will stick together and
separating each fiber is difficult (see Supporting Information Figure S8). The  solidifying performance
of the coagulation bath for fiber formation may have relationship
with the functional groups of polymeric chains, the polarity and surface
tension of coagulation bath. Specially, we found that the PVAm aqueous
solution will become solid rapidly in methanol or ethanol and return
to be highly viscoelastic status after it has evaporated, indicating
that PVAm aqueous solution or PVAm gel can be used as smart material
and selective filtration material for water/ethanol mixed solution.
During fiber formation, water diffuses in ethanol coagulation bath;
however, ethanol could not enter the PVAm aqueous solution. Meanwhile,
ethanol or methanol compels the primary amine groups to only vibrate
inside the fiber. That phenomenon was observed in our previous work
when the fibers grafted with PEI were immersed into ethanol.35−37

2.1.3 Specific Viscosity of Solution on PVAm Nanofiber
Formation
2.1.3.1 Effect of Concentration on Specific Viscosity
of solution
Figure 2 shows that the specific viscosity increases from 10 to 2500
mPa.s with the concentration of the PVAm solution increasing from
1 to 12 wt % (rotation speed was 8000 rpm; coagulation liquid is ethanol;
orifice distance and diameter are 1.0 and 0.4 mm). Changes in the
slope of the curve indicate the generation of unentangle and entangle
between the PVAm polymer chains. Obviously, the critical concentration
(c*) of PVAm is found to be 5.5 wt %. At low concentration
value (2 wt %), beads and very short fibers are obtained frequently.
When the PVAm solution concentration increases to and above the critical
concentration (5.5 wt %), more PVAm molecular chains overlap; uniform
and continuous fibers are fabricated. Meanwhile, fewer solution beads
are generated. Compared with newest reported works,13,15 the viscoelastic PVAm aqueous solution may be the highest spinning
solution, up to 2500 mPa.s (almost 10 times of other spinning solutions).

2.1.3.2 pH Value and Temperature on Specific Viscosity
of Solution
Figure 3a shows that using sodium hydroxide as the pH regulator, the
solution viscosity decreases rapidly with the pH value increasing
from 7 to 11. The result is consistent with the result reported by
Kobayashi et al.38 PVAm is a cationic polyelectrolyte,
and its primary amine groups are protonated under acidic conditions.1 Under strong basic conditions, at pH 11 and higher,
there are almost no protonated groups and the conformation of the
polymer chain changes from extended to mainly coiled. Thus, the electrostatic
interaction between PVAm molecular chains becomes weaker and weaker.
Macroscopically, the intrinsic viscosity decreases. When ethylenediamine
(EDA) aqueous is used as a pH regulator, the viscosity is higher than
that when NaOH aqueous is used as a pH regulator. The reason may be
because ethylenediamine (EDA) is ionized to protect PVAm polymer chains
to coil rapidly.

Figure 3 Effect of pH value on the specific viscosity of PVAm aqueous
solution
at room temperature (left) and the effect of temperature on the specific
viscosity of PVAm aqueous solution (right).

The effect of temperature on the viscosity is indicated
in Figure 3b. The higher
the
solution concentration, the viscosity decreases faster as the temperature
increases, especially when the temperature is higher than 25 °C.
Therefore, the solution viscosity can be regulated conveniently by
changing the concentration, pH value, and temperature.

2.1.4 Rotation Speed on PVAm Nanofiber Formation
With the same parameters: ethanol as coagulation bath; orifice
distance and diameters 1.0 and 0.4 mm, concentration 8 wt %; when
the rotation speed is 4000 rpm or less, the centrifugal force is less
than the surface tension of spinning solution, resulting in beads
and very short fibers, and they are dispersed along a wide ring with
diameter between 3 and 11 cm (Figure 4a). As the rotation speed increases from 6000 to 8000
rpm, continuous fibers spread on a narrow ring with diameter between
4 and 8 cm (Figure 4b), between 5 and 9 cm (Figure 4c), respectively. However, when spun at 12 000
rpm, continuous fibers are spread on a wider ring with diameter between
4 and 10 cm than other rotation speed; meanwhile, resulting in nanofibers
with smaller diameter and higher alignment (Figure 4d).

Figure 4 Effect of different rotation speeds on fiber’s
alignment:
(a) 4000 rpm, (b) 6000 rpm, (c) 8000 rpm, and (d) 12 000 rpm.

In summary, the optimal parameters can be listed
as follows: better
rotation speed of 8000 rpm; better specific viscosity between 800
and 2500 mPa.s (corresponding concentrations are 8–12 wt %);
and viscosity can be controlled conveniently by concentration and
EDA aqueous solution. Ethanol is the best coagulation bath. According
to the existing literatures, the PVAm superfine fibers can be applicable
to selective separation and filtration for some chemicals and smart
materials. In this work, the RJWS technique is applied to prepare
PVAm-based MINFs for enhancing the BPA detection accuracy.

2.2 Analysis of PVAm-Based MINF for BPA Recognition
2.2.1 Morphology of PVAm-Based MINF
With
rotary jet wet spinning technique, PVAm molecular imprinting nanofibers
(MINFs) for BPA recognition are prepared by adding phenol red as a
dummy template into the PVAm spinning solution and removing the template
after nanofibers are cross-linked with GA. Phenol red template amount
affects the binding sites amount positively. It means that more template
will lead to more binding sites. So, the better choice is that more
phenol red will be added to the spinning solution; however, excessive
phenol red template (more than 0.04 mM) will lead to a much insoluble
template, which will seriously block the spinning orifice.2,5 In this work, phenol red template amount was selected to be 0.03
mM in the following preparation of MINFs for BPA (see Supporting Information Figure S9).

The color of PVAm nanofibers
with phenol red template is dark yellow (Figure 5a). After cross-linking and removing phenol
red template, the PVAm nanofibers turned light yellow; the resulted
superfine fibers were named PVAm molecular imprinting nanofibers (MINFs).
The color of the original PVAm nanofibers was white (Figure 5b). After cross-linking, the
PVAm nanofibers turned light yellow (Figure 5c). Adding phenol red template affects the
viscoelasticity of the PVAm spinning solution; in addition, after
cross-linking and removing phenol red template, the resulting MINFs
(Figure 5d,f) presented
a little rougher surface than that of NMINF (Figure 5e,g). Because the size of specific binding
sites is about several nanometers, it is difficult to catch the changes
after removing phenol red template on the resulted SEM images in this
work. In addition, MIPs prepared by bulk polymerization possess an
irregular shape (Figure 5h) and an obviously higher porosity (Figure 5i). The main reason of the higher porosity
in MIPs may be the existence of porogen (methanol). So, to increase
the porosity of MINFs, one suitable porogen should be added to the
spinning solution.

Figure 5 Morphology of MINFs (a, d, and f, 8000 rpm rotation speed,
8 wt
% concentration), NMINFs (b, c, e, and g, 8000 rpm rotation speed,
8 wt % concentration), and MIPs fabricated by bulk polymerization
(h and i, screened with 300 mesh screen).

The chemical structure changes in original PVAm
fibers, transitional
PVAm fibers, and resulted MINFs are characterized by using infrared
(IR), and the spectra are presented in Figure 6. The strong bands at about 3400, 3000, and
1654 cm–1 are characteristic of the N–H stretching,
C–H stretching, and C=O stretching in pure PVAm fibers,
respectively. After adding phenol red into the spinning solution,
spinning onto the coagulation bath, and cross-linking with glutaraldehyde,
the absorption signals of N–H stretching become weaker. Five
new bands obviously display at 1508, 1170, 1132 cm–1, 1015, and 738 cm–1, which are characteristic
of C=N stretching, S=O stretching, and benzene-ring
stretching in transitional PVAm fibers, respectively. Furthermore,
the existence of C=N stretching demonstrates Schiff base is
formed by primary amine group reacting with glutaraldehyde. The existence
of S=O stretching and benzene-ring stretching demonstrates
the existence of phenol red template in PVAm fibers. Finally, phenol
red template is eluted from transitional PVAm fibers. In comparison
with the IR spectra of the original PVAm fibers, the only difference
is a band at 1508 cm–1 in the IR spectra of the
resulting MINFs, which indicates the existence of Schiff base. Meanwhile,
phenol red is proved to be removed completely from transitional PVAm
fibers.

Figure 6 IR spectra of three PVAm fibers fabricated during three steps:
pure PVAm fiber is the original fiber (black); PVAm + phenol red cross-linking
fiber is the transitional fiber (red)after primary amine group reacting
with glutaraldehyde; PVAm cross-linking fiber is the resulted fiber
(blue) after removing phenol red template.

2.2.2 Adsorption Properties and Selectivity of
PVAm-Based MINFs
2.2.2.1 Adsorption Properties
The adsorption
property of molecular imprinting nanofibers spun at various speeds
(6000, 8000, and 12 000 rpm) is investigated. All these MINFs
fabricated with 0.03 mM phenol red template and 8 wt % PVAm concentration.
The isotherm curves show the adsorption amount of MINFs for BPA is
higher than that of NMINFs (Figure 7a). It is proved that MINFs spun at a higher spun speed,
leading to a thinner diameter, has a higher surface area. The binding
affinity of MINFs to BPA template is evaluated by Scatchard plot analysis
(Figure 7b) (spun at
12 000 rpm). The number of fitting lines represents the class
of binding sites, and the values of association constants indicate
the strength of the binding affinity.39,40

Figure 7 Adsorption
properties of MINFs spun at different speeds and NMINFs
(a, spun at 8000 rpm). Scatchard plot analysis of MINFs for its two
classes of binding sites, association constant Ka = 8.6 mg/L, maximum capacity = 5.6 mg/g (b). Comparison of
adsorption speed among MINFs, NMINFs, and MIPs (c). Comparison of
selectivity for BPA and its analogues among MINFs, NMINFs, and MIPs.

Figure 7b shows
two straight lines fitting the Scatchard equation (Qe/Ce = −(1/Ka) × Qe + Qmax/Ka), indicating
that there are two classes of binding sites in MINFs. From the Scatchard
plot, a low association constant Ka (8.6
mg/L, Line 1) is obtained, meaning a strong binding interaction between
MINFs and BPA. The maximum binding capacity of MINFs is 5.6 mg/g (0.024
mmol/g, Line 2), which is lower than the MIPs prepared by bulk polymerization
in the comparative experiments and other reported work.40 However, considering the phenol red dummy template
amount is 0.03 mmol per gram PVAm polymer in the MINF preparation
system, it can be calculated that about 80% selective binding sites
are efficiently utilized to binding BPA templates. In addition,  the
amount of template to that  of cross-linker and monomer is only
about 1% in this work, which is lower than that of MIPs prepared by
bulk polymerization (about 8.8%) and other reported work (about 6.2%).40 It indicates that more very expensive templates
can be saved or reduce the risk of highly toxic templates to scientists
and environment.

The adsorption equilibrium of MINFs in BPA
solution at low concentration
is reached in 30 min (Figure 7c); it is similar to other nanofiber materials fabricated
by ES.31 However, the adsorption equilibrium
time of MIPs prepared by bulk polymerization for BPA at low concentration
is about 80 min (Figure 7c). The main reason may be that the particle size is too big to penetrate.

2.2.2.2 Selectivity
The selectivity coefficients
(Kc) of the two adsorbents for BPA against
BP or bis(4-hydorxyphenyl) sulfone (BPS) in their mixed solution are
shown in Figure 7d
and Table 1. It can
be found that after adopting the dummy template imprinting technique,
the resulted MINFs show an obviously higher selective affinity than
NMINFs. At the concentration of 25 mg/L, the imprinted factor was
2.4 and the competitive coefficient of MINFs for BPA against BPS or
BP reaches up to 5.3 or 6.5, respectively. These results indicate
that MINFs possess good imprinting effect and high selectivity for
BPA, named high recognition for BPA.

Table 1 Imprinted Factor and Selectivity Coefficients
of Four Materials: MINFs, NMINFs, MIPs, and Nonmolecular Imprinting
Polymer Particles (NMIPs)
 	 	 	 	selectivity
coefficients (Kc)	
adsorbent fibers	adsorption amount (mg/g)	s.d. (mg/g)	imprinting factor (IF)	BP	BPS	
MINF	5.3	0.23	2.4	6.5	5.3	
NMINF	2.2	0.25	 	2.6	2.1	
MIPs	8.4	0.43	2.63	9.2	6.5	
NMIPs	3.2	0.28	 	1.4	1.8	
From Figure 7d and Table 1, the selective coefficient
(Kc) of MIPs prepared by bulk polymerization
is higher than MINF, against BPS or BP, is up to 6.5 and 9.2. The
main reason may be that BPA template is used during the preparation
of molecular imprinting polymers (MIPs). After removing the BPA template,
the obtained three-dimensional binding sites are more precise than
that obtained using phenol red as a dummy template. Because the molecular
structure of BP and BPS are more rigid than that of BPA, it is more
difficult for them to interact with the binding sites rapidly.

After seven cycles of adsorption–desorption experiments,
the adsorption capacity of MINFs in BPA remain stable (see Supporting
Information Figure S10).

2.2.3 Applied to Solid-Phase Microextraction (SPME)
Materials for BPA Practical Detection
According to the above
results, the MINFs process a high selective adsorption for BPA against
its analogues. The result indicates that MINFs can be used as pretreatment
materials to selectively absorb BPA from very complex and dilute aqueous
samples. The chromatograms of spiked standard mixture by direct injection
analysis are shown in Figure 8a. It is shown that the peak signal of BPA is very weak (the
concentration was detected to be 0.06 ng/mL), leading to the deterioration
of the detection accuracy. After the SPME treatment with PVAm-based
MINFs, the signal of BPA is obviously increased (Figure 8b); the concentration is detected
to be 0.76 ng/mL. The recovery of BPA reaches 76%.

Figure 8 Chromatograms of the
spiked standard water (1) and river water
(2): curves a and c, samples are directly injected for HPLC analysis;
curves b and d, samples are pretreated by MINF microextraction prior
to be injected for HPLC analysis; in all curves, peak 1, peak 2, and
peak 3 represent BPS, BP, and BPA, respectively.

After being injected directly, BPA in real river
water cannot be
detected by HPLC (Figure 8c), indicating the concentrations of BPA below
the limit of detection (LOD) of the HPLC analysis system. However,
after being extracted with PVAm-based MINFs, the peak signals of BPA,
BP, and BPS are captured (Figure 8d). The detection accuracy for BPA increases with highest
times against its analogues, and the concentration of BPA is detected
to be 60 ng/L. The high recognition performance of PVAm-based MINFs
indicates that the resulted PVAm-based MINFs meet well the requirement
of industrial application.

3 Conclusions
In this work, rotary jet
spinning technique (RJS) was applied to
the fabrication of molecular imprinting nanofibers for the first time.
Rotary jet wet spinning (RJWS) has been developed for pure polyelectrolyte
nanofiber membrane with a strong charge density. Pure PVAm nanofibers
are fabricated from their highly viscoelastic aqueous solution without
additional polymers by RJWS. It is found that PVAm aqueous solution
possesses reversible sensitivity to alcohol, and the smallest diameter
of PVAm nanofiber with capillary wavelength is 50 nm, confirming the
dimension limit of rotary jet spinning. Finally, the association constant
(8.6 mg/L), equilibrium time (30 min), and binding sites utilization
rate (80%) of MINFs are evaluated, indicating that MINFs meet well
the requirement of industrial application. In comparison with other
MINF materials fabricated by ES, it is not necessary to synthesize
uniform nanosize particles prior to spinning, choose a volatile solvent,
and worry about the leakage of residual template with the combination
of RJS and DMI in this work. The adsorption amount and selectivity
of MINFs are little lower than those of MIPs prepared by bulk polymerization.
Adding one suitable porogen will increase the specific binding amount
of MINFs in future. RJWS will further promote the industrial application
of RJS.

Figure 9 BPA and its analogue compounds used in
this work.

4.2 Instruments
A rotary jet wet spinning
machine was made by our group and used to fabricate PVAm nanofibers
(see Supporting Information Figure S1).
UV light (LUYOR-2010AUV, LUYOR Corporation) and high-energy ball mill
(8000D Mixer/Mill, SPEX Co., Ltd.) were used to prepare molecular
imprinting polymeric particles. A spectrophotometer (UV-5100, Shanghai
Metash instruments Co., Ltd.) was used to measure the concentration
of BPA, BP, and BPS in adsorption and selectivity experiments. A Fourier
transform infrared (FT-IR) analyzer (Nicolet/Nexus 670), equipped
with an ATR objective, was employed to test the chemical structure
of materials (at the range of 400 to 4000 cm–1).
A field-emission scanning electron microscope (JSM-6330F, Japan) was
used to observe the surface morphology of nanofibers. Powder X-ray
diffraction (XRD, D8 ADVANCE, BRUKER Textile Technologies GmbH &
Co., KG, Germany) was employed to analyze PVAm nanofibers. A HPLC
system (LCQ, Thermo Fisher) was used to demonstrate selective recognition
and solid-phase microextraction (SPME) performance of the resulting
molecular imprinting nanofibers.

4.3 Preparation of PVAm Nanofibers and PVAm-Based
MINFs
First, optimal parameters of spinning process are investigated.
The PVAm powder is dissolved in pure water with stirring. After degassing,
the mixed solution is injected into the rotatable reservoir slowly.
The fiber spinning process is composed of (1) the PVAm solution jetted
through the orifice at high rotating speed and extruded into one continuous
ultrafine stream and (2) the ultrafine stream dropped on one metal
filter (with 200–300 mesh) and immersed into a coagulation
bath, forming nanofibers rapidly. Several important optimal parameters
of PVAm nanofiber fabrication are investigated, such as coagulation
bath, specific viscosity of solution (three main factors affect viscosity,
such as concentration, pH value, and temperature), and spinning speed.

To demonstrate the practical application, PVAm-based molecular
imprinting nanofibers (MINFs) of bisphenol A (one endocrine disruptor)
recognition are prepared as follows.

Phenol red is dissolved
in basic aqueous solution (its pH value
is regulated to 11 with NaOH or EDA); then, the PVAm polymer powder
is dissolved in a mixed solution. The primary amine groups of PVAm
interact with the hydroxyl group of phenol red with a noncovalent
bond. After cross-linking between PVAm nanofiber and glutaraldehyde,
phenol red dummy template is removed by dynamic elution with basic
aqueous/ethanol mixed solution until no phenol red is detected by
a UV–vis spectrophotometer (360 nm). Many selective binding
sites for BPA molecular in MINFs are obtained. The preparation principle
of MINFs is illustrated in Scheme 1. The nonmolecular imprinted nanofibers (NMINFs) is
prepared using the same procedure but without adding phenol red.

Scheme 1 Preparation of MINFs
4.4 Preparation of MIPs by Bulk Polymerization
Similar to the work of Pérez-Moral and Mayes,41 in this work, bulk imprinted polymeric particles
were synthesized using BPA (2 mmol), MAA (14 mmol), EGDMA (20 mmol),
methanol (8 mL), and BEE (0.02 g) as template, functional monomer,
cross-linking agent, solvent, and photoinitiator, respectively, through
optimized experiments. The bulk polymerization was carried out under
UV light for 15 min at room temperature. The resulting molecular imprinting
particles were prepared after grinding with ball mill, screening with
stainless steel screen (300 mesh) and template elution (see Supporting
Information Figures S2 and S3). (1) Nonimprinted
polymeric particles were synthesized following the same procedure
but without the BPA template.

4.5 Batch Adsorption and Competitive Adsorption
The batch adsorptions are carried out as follows: the resulted
MINFs, MIPs (0.25 g), or NMINFs (0.25 g) are added into 25 mL of BPA
aqueous solution with concentrations from 5 to 100 mg/L. The residual
BPA concentration is determined by a UV–vis spectrophotometer
at the wavelength of 276 nm every 5 min. The selectivity of MINFs
for BPA is evaluated by the competitive adsorption between BPA and
its analogue. MINFs, MIPs (0.25 g), or NMINFs (0.25 g) are dispersed
in 25 mL of sodium tetraborate buffer solution (pH value = 9.18) containing
BPA and the competitive species (BP or BPS). After equilibrium adsorption,
the concentrations of BPA, BP, or BPS in the mixed solutions are measured
with a UV–vis spectrophotometer by resolving the simultaneous
equations of Beer–Lambert measured at 276 and 320 nm, respectively.
The detailed experimental operation and results processing of batch
adsorption, competitive adsorption, and the adsorption–desorption
repeated experiments have been listed in our previous work.35

4.6 SPME Performance for BPA Detection
The selective recognition for BPA of the resulting MINFs can be demonstrated
by solid-phase microextraction (SPME) performance in spiked standard
samples and real river water. The initial concentrations of spiked
standard solutions, containing BPA and its two analogues, are 1, 5,
and 20 ng/mL, respectively. The river water samples are drawn from
three locations of the TianSha River (around Wuyi University, China).
All of the samples are filtered with mixed cellulose filters (0.45
and 0.25 μm) two times and purified by centrifugal force for
10 min at 8000 rpm. Fifty milliliters of the supernatant flows through
a glass tube (Φ10 × 100 mm2) packed with 0.25
g of MINFs at a flow rate of 6 BV/h to extract trace chemicals. After
extraction, 4 mL of ethanol is used to elute BPA from the MINFs at
a flow rate of 2 BV/h, and their BPA concentration are determined
with HPLC. Finally, the concentration of BPA in the spiked standard
solutions and river water samples are calculated.
