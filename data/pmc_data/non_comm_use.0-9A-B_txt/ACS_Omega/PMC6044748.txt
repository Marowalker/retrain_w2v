We report herein an
investigation of carbazole-based cyanine,
(E)-4-(2-(9-(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl)-9H-carbazol-3-yl)-vinyl)-1-methyl-quinolin-1-iumiodide (SLM), as an
effective theranostic agent for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This
cyanine exhibited desirable multifunctional and biological properties,
including amyloid-β (Aβ)-oligomerization inhibition, blood–brain
barrier permeability, low neurotoxicity, neuroprotective effect against
Aβ-induced toxicities, high selectivity and strong binding interactions
with Aβ peptide/species, good biostability, as well as strong
fluorescence enhancement upon binding to Aβ species for diagnosis
and therapy of AD. This cyanine has been successfully applied to perform
near-infrared in vivo imaging of Aβ species in transgenic AD
mouse model. The triple transgenic AD mice intraperitoneally treated
with SLM showed significant recovery of cognitive deficits. Furthermore,
those SLM-treated mice exhibited a substantial decrease in both of
oligomeric Aβ contents and tau proteins in their brain, which
was attributed to the induction of autophagic flux. These findings
demonstrated for the first time that SLM is an effective theranostic
agent with in vivo efficacy for diagnosis and treatment of AD in mouse
models.

==== Body
Introduction
Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative
dementia, which leads to an impairment of various cognitive functions
and memory loss, affecting 47 million people worldwide in 2015.1 Since AD is still incurable, it does place a
huge burden to both the medical field and the society. Two of the
pathological hallmarks of AD include the presence of extracellular
amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, primarily composed of misfolded
Aβ(1–40) and Aβ(1–42) aggregates and intracellular tau neurofibrillary tangles, due to
the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins.2−4 Since Aβ peptides and tau
proteins are widely believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of
AD, they represent the primary drug targets for the development of
disease-modifying therapy in AD.5,6 Among various drug development
strategies, targeting the overproduction and inefficient clearance
of the Aβ peptides has constituted one of the primary focuses.7,8 Increasing evidence suggests that soluble Aβ oligomers are
more neurotoxic than monomers and aggregates.9,10 Hence,
the recent trials of the treatment approach for AD is to reduce the
level and inhibit the formation of soluble toxic Aβ oligomers,
which are believed to impair intracellular membranes leading to mitochondrial
and lysosomal dysfunctions and further resulting in neuronal and synaptic
damage, as implicated by the modified amyloid cascade hypothesis.
The studies also showed that soluble Aβ oligomers would facilitate
the tau pathology by influencing the signaling pathways that mediate
the phosphorylation of the tau protein, thereby triggering AD.11 Studies have indicated that the deposition of
tau-associated neurofibrillary tangles correlates well with the disease
progression of AD and thus it also becomes an important therapeutic
target of AD.12,13

Meanwhile, Aβ oligomers
can be used as predictive disease biomarkers for monitoring of progression
and diagnosis of AD. Among various detection techniques, noninvasive
near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging is the most intriguing, particularly
for early diagnosis of AD. A variety of fluorescence probes have been
developed for detecting Aβ peptides; nonetheless, most of them
are still not suitable for in vivo NIR imaging for their limited blood–brain
barrier (BBB) permeability, intrinsic neurotoxicity, poor binding
affinity toward Aβ, and interference by autofluorescence.

Molecules that exhibit theranostic functions of Aβ oligomerization/aggregation
inhibition and imaging capability of Aβ species have recently
been reported;14−18 however, their
respective in vivo efficacy for cognitive improvement and simultaneously
performing imaging of Aβ species in vivo in AD mouse model have
not been explored and demonstrated. It is attributed to the diverse
and strict criteria of an effective theranostic agent for therapy
and diagnosis of AD, which include good BBB permeability, low neurotoxicity,
potent Aβ aggregation inhibition, neuroprotective effect against
Aβ- induced toxicity, high selectivity and targeting to Aβ
peptide/species, good biostability as well as strong fluorescence
enhancement upon binding to Aβ peptide/species.19−21 Cyanine fluorophores are biocompatible
and versatile as a fluorescence sensing probe for in vitro and in
vivo bioimaging.22−25 It was previously shown that carbazole-based
quinolinium cyanines not only exhibited selective binding to Aβ
peptides rendering the potential for direct imaging of Aβ species
but also exerted strong inhibition on Aβ peptide aggregation,
offering promise as a therapeutic agent for AD.24 We herein report that the carbazole-based cyanine, (E)-4-(2-(9-(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl)-9H-carbazol-3-yl)-vinyl)-1-methyl-quinolin-1-iumiodide (SLM) (Figure 1) has been successfully
used as an in vivo imaging agent for Aβ species in mouse model.
In addition, administration of Aβ-aggregation inhibition and
neuroprotective SLM significantly protects triple transgenic (3 ×
Tg-AD) mice from cognitive decline, concomitant with a substantial
decrease in contents of oligomeric Aβ and tau proteins in the
cerebral hippocampal region. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first time that an effective theranostic agent shows integrated
functions of (i) in vivo NIR imaging of Aβ species in AD mouse
models as well as (ii) potent in vivo efficacy of improving cognitive
deficit and reduction of Aβ plaques and tau content.

Results and Discussion
NIR imaging can
be a useful and promising tool for early AD diagnosis, as it can be
applied to visualize and monitor the formation of Aβ aggregates
and to evaluate the efficacy of the AD treatment in the animal model.
Taking advantage of its strong binding to Aβ species (Kd(Aβ1–40) of fibril
= 13.1 μM, Kd(Aβ1–40) of monomer = 96.6 μM; Kd(Aβ1–42) of fibril = 11.4 μM, Kd(Aβ1–42) of monomer = 40.2 μM)
that results in strong fluorescence enhancement (Table S1 and Figure S1), SLM shows great potential as in vivo
Aβ NIR imaging agent. We demonstrated the application of SLM
in detecting and imaging of Aβ species in a 9-month-old amyloid
precursor proteins (APP)/PS1 transgenic (Tg) mouse in vivo. Figure 2a displays the fluorescence
images of Tg and wild-type (WT) mice at different time points before
and after intravenous injection of SLM at a dosage of 5 mg/kg. As
clearly seen, the fluorescence intensity from the brain of Tg mouse
is significantly higher than that of WT at all time points recorded.
The fluorescence signal also retained significantly longer in the
Tg mouse when compared with that of the WT, which was attributed to
the strong binding of SLM to the Aβ species in the brain of
the Tg mouse. This is consistent with the results obtained from the
semiquantitative kinetic clearance profile analysis of fluorescence
images of the brains of Tg and WT mice (Figure S4). The longer clearance time further confirmed the strong
binding interactions of SLM with Aβ species. Nonetheless,
accurate quantification of SLM for its permeability and pharmacokinetics
by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry study would be definitely
important for further clinical studies. To ascertain the targeting
property of SLM toward Aβ species, the brain slices of Tg mouse
(9 months old) after tail-vein injection with SLM was ex vivo co-stained
with Aβ plaque-specific thioflavin (ThT) dye. As shown in Figure 2b, the fluorescence
of SLM overlapped well with that of ThT in the central core of the
cluster plaques, indicating that SLM is highly specific to Aβ
plaques. In addition to staining the Aβ plaques/fibrils, the
weaker fluorescence of SLM was observed in the peripheral of the clusters,
which could not be labeled by ThT. It is due to the fact that ThT
only labels aggregated Aβ but SLM can also bind strongly with
Aβ oligomers.

Figure 2 (a) Fluorescence images
of Tg (9 months old) and wild-type
mice at different time points before and after intravenous injection
of SLM (5 mg/kg). λex = 535 nm, λem = 600–640 nm. (b) Histological staining of the brain slices
from 9-month transgenic mice stained with SLM via tail-vein injection
(λex = 488 nm, λem = 640–680
nm) and co-stained with ThT (λex = 405 nm, λem = 460–490 nm). The images are 40× magnification
of the selected regions.

SLM also exhibits inhibition effect on the
oligomerization of Aβ(1–42), as evaluated
by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS–PAGE) analysis (Figure S2),
where it showed a smaller amount of dimeric Aβ(1–42) formation in the presence of SLM. Besides, LC50 of SLM was determined
to be 20 μM using SH-SY5Y cells by MTT assay (Figure S3). Neuroprotective effect of inhibitor compounds
is one of the important screening parameters for pharmaceutical potential
in AD treatment. The neuroprotective effect of SLM against the more
neurotoxic Aβ(1–42) on primary hippocampal
cells was then studied. The results, summarized in Figure 3, indicated that SLM showed
significantly higher survival rate and, thus, beneficial to the neuronal
cells that were incubated with Aβ(1–42) over
a period of 24 h, highlighting tremendous promise of this cyanine
for preventive and therapeutic treatment of AD.

Figure 3 (a) Neuroprotective effect
of the cyanine compounds against
the toxicity induced by Aβ(1–42) on primary
hippocampal cells. SLM was found to be neuroprotective, (b) the neuroprotective
cyanine attenuated the Aβ(1–42)-induced reactive
oxygen species (ROS) level on primary hippocampal cells. The relative
percentage represented the cell death and ROS level of the Aβ(1–42)-treated cells, respectively, in the presence
and absence of SLM.

Given that elevation
in oxidative stress constitutes parts of the causative factors for
Aβ-induced neurotoxicity,26,27 we investigated the
neuroprotective effect of SLM against reactive oxygen species (ROS)
in neuronal primary cells. A ROS fluorescent dye, carboxyl-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein
diacetate (carboxyl-DCFDA), was employed to monitor the ROS level
in primary hippocampal cells that were exposed to Aβ(1–42) in the presence and absence of the neuroprotective SLM. Indeed,
a significant elevation of ROS level in the control cells was induced
by the addition of 10 μM Aβ(1–42) in
24 h. The ROS level was decreased by about 20%, as illustrated in Figure 3, when the neuronal
cells were co-incubated with neuroprotective SLM. These results unambiguously
indicated that SLM could protect the health of the neuronal cells
by attenuating the ROS level.

In view that SLM possessed all
of the desired functional and biological properties for potential
therapeutics for AD, we then examined the in vivo efficacy of SLM
against cognitive impairment using triple transgenic AD model mice
(3 × Tg-AD) expressing human gene mutants APPswe, PS1M146V, and
tauP301L. These 3 × Tg-AD mice showed intracellular Aβ
at 3–6 months of age and cognitive impairment at 6 months of
age. The 8-month-old 3 × Tg-AD mice received the cyanine inhibitors,
SLM, for 45 days (2.25 mg/kg/day) intraperitoneally. No obvious differences
in body weight or changes in physical behavior (swimming speed) were
observed among the groups during the 45 days administration (Figures S5 and S6). Morris water maze tests were
performed after the 45 days SLM treatment. As shown in Figure 4a,b, the SLM-treated 3 ×
Tg-AD mice exhibited a significantly shorter latency to escape onto
the hidden platform, as compared to the control Tg mice on days 3,
4, and 5 (*P < 0.05, n = 19;
**P < 0.001, n = 19; ***P < 0.0001, n = 19). Moreover, the SLM-treated
3 × Tg-AD mice traveled to the previously learned platform quadrant
more frequently than the control ones, as assessed by the probe test
(Figure 4c,d). The
time spent in the previously learned platform quadrant was also longer
for the treated 3 × Tg-AD mice after 24 and 72 h of the hidden
platform test. All these results consistently support that the SLM-treated
3 × Tg-AD mice showed a significant cognitive improvement, not
only enhancing learning skills in the hidden platform test but also
improving the spatial memory in the probe trial.

Figure 4 (a, b) Results of hidden
platform tests in the Morris
water maze
experiment for the SLM-treated 3 × Tg-AD mice, the control, and
the WT, on training day and days 1–5 (*P <
0.05, n = 19; **P < 0.001, n = 19; ***P < 0.0001, n = 19). (c, d) Results of the probe trial and the time spent in the
previously learned platform quadrant for the WT, control, and the
treated mice after 24 and 72 h of the hidden platform test. The data
were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).

We also examined
the Aβ and tau contents in the brain of the SLM-treated Tg mice
via the western blot analysis and immunofluorescence after the cognitive
test. Remarkably, the Aβ content substantially decreased, particularly
those of the toxic Aβ oligomers with 8, 12, 16, 25, 40, and
55 kDa as the total tau (tau-5) and phosphorylated tau (ps422) proteins
in hippocampal regions, as compared with those of the control (see Figure 5a–c,e–g),
suggesting that the cyanine inhibitor can ameliorate both Aβ
and tau pathologies in the 3 × Tg-AD mouse model. The presence
of Aβ and tau, which was visualized by immunostaining in the
brain slices of the treated 3 × Tg-AD mice, was obviously reduced
compared to those of the untreated 3 × Tg-AD mice (Figure 5d,h). The activity of glycogen
synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) can be inhibited by Akt-mediated phosphorylation
at Ser9 of GSK3β. The level of inactive phosphorylated glycogen
synthase kinase-3β (p-GSK3β) was significantly higher
in the SLM-treated Tg mice, as well as the increase in the ratio of
p-GSK3β/GSK3β, indicating the reduction of GSK3β
activity, which provides a direct insight into the decrease of the
phosphorylated tau content (Figure S7c,d). These results also indicate that the reduction of the toxic Aβ
oligomers level alleviates the tau dysfunction in the SLM-treated
Tg mice.

Figure 5 Levels of Aβ and
tau in the hippocampal and cortical region of SLM-treated 3 ×
Tg-AD mice were analyzed with the western blot and immunofluorescence.
The protein contents of the brain lysates were analyzed with the western
blot ((a–c) for oligomeric Aβ, (e–g) for tau,
and pS422). Brain slices of the hippocampus and the cortex were immunostained
for Aβ (d) and tau (h).

Increasing evidence implies that dysfunctional autophagy
plays a crucial role in the AD pathogenesis, such as the failure of
Aβ clearance.28,29 Thus, we have investigated whether
SLM would modulate autophagic dysfunction. It was found that the levels
of amyloid precursor proteins (APPs) and the β-site APP-cleaving
enzyme 1 (Bace 1) in the SLM-treated Tg mice were similar to those
of the control, suggesting that the Aβ production was not disrupted
or suppressed (Figure S7a,b). On the other
hand, SLM treatment yielded a significantly reduced level of a key
autophagy gatekeeper, phosphorylated form of mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR), which was concomitant with substantially attenuated phosphorylation
of Akt, an upstream effector of mTOR, that modulates its activation
as well as a significant increase in a proautophagic protein, the
mammalian orthologue of yeast Atg6 (Beclin 1) level, as compared with
that of the control (see Figure S8), strongly
suggesting autophagic induction.30−32 Furthermore, both the
levels of microtubule-associated
protein light chain 3-II (LC3-II), which was degraded by lysosomal
hydrolases in autophagolysosomes and the LC3-associated p62 protein
(sequestosome 1), a marker of autophagic flux, were found to be markedly
decreased. The level of the lysosomal protease, cathepsin D (CatD),
that mediates the degradation in autophagolysosomes was found to be
significantly increased. All these results unanimously support the
fact that autophagic pathways were significantly modulated in the
SLM-treated 3 × Tg-AD mice relative to the untreated counterparts,
resulting in the reduction of Aβ deposits and tau contents as
well as recovery of cognitive deficits in the AD mouse model.

Conclusions
A systematic evaluation
of carbazole-based cyanine, SLM, including Aβ binding behavior,
Aβ1–42 oligomerization inhibition, cytotoxicity,
neuroprotective effect, BBB permeability as well as in vivo imaging
and efficacy as a novel and effective theranostic agent for diagnosis
and treatment of AD was investigated. Remarkably, SLM possessing all
of the desirable properties as an in vivo imaging agent can perform
NIR imaging of Aβ species in vivo. Furthermore, the SLM-treated
3 × Tg-AD mice showed substantial improvement in cognitive functions,
including spatial learning and memory. SLM also exhibited the capability
to significantly decrease the oligomeric Aβ contents, as well
as reduce t-tau (tau-5) and p-tau protein (ps422) levels in the brain
of the 3 × Tg-AD mice, which was attributed to the modulation
of autophagic flux. The present study represents the first in vivo
evidence that SLM can not only conduct the imaging of Aβ species
in vivo but also ameliorate both Aβ and tau pathologies concomitant
with a reduction in the levels of toxic Aβ oligomers and p-tau
protein. SLM also represents the first effective theranostic agent
for the therapy and diagnosis of AD. Our findings open up a new vista
to develop more potent theranostic agents for clinical applications
in AD.

Materials and Methods
Sample Preparation of Aβ(1–40) Fibril
Stock monomeric Aβ(1–40) (Invitrogen) solution was prepared by dissolving 1 mg of Aβ(1–40) powder in 400 μL of 0.02% ammonia solution
without any purification and stored at −20 °C until use.
Aβ(1–40) fibril was prepared by diluting the
stock monomeric Aβ(1–40) to 50 mM with filtered
phosphate buffer solution and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h.

Sample Preparation of Aβ(1–42) Aggregates
Stock monomeric Aβ(1–42) (rPeptide) solution
was prepared by dissolving 1 mg of Aβ(1–42) powder in 400 μL of 1% ammonium solution
without any purification and stored at −20 °C until use.
The aggregate was prepared by diluting the stock monomeric solution
to 200 μM with 10 mM filtered HCl and incubated at 37 °C
for 6 days.

Fluorescence Titration
SLM solution
of 400 and 50 μM Aβ(1–40) monomer/fibril
and Aβ(1–42) monomer/aggregate
solution were prepared in phosphate buffer. By mixing a corresponding
amount of cyanine solution, buffer, and a constant amount of Aβ
solution, 20 μL of mixture solution with different SLM-to-Aβ
ratios were prepared. Emission measurement was obtained on PTI Time
Master C-720.

SDS–PAGE
Monomeric Aβ(1–42) was first treated with
100% hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP). The residual HFIP was removed under
vacuum, and the resulting peptide was stored at −20 °C.
The oligomeric Aβ(1–42) was prepared by resuspending
the treated monomeric Aβ(1–42) in anhydrous
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) with a final concentration of 5 mM. The
peptide solution was diluted to a final concentration of 100 μM
with F-12 (without phenol red) culture medium and co-incubated with
an appropriate amount of SLM solution at 4 °C for 24 h. All samples
were then treated with PICUP and followed by SDS–PAGE and Coomassie
Blue staining.

Cell Assay Procedures
Cell Culture and Medium
All cell
culture reagents were purchased from Gibco. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y
cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM)/Ham’s F-12 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum. Cells were grown in a humidified cell incubator at 37
°C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere.

Primary Cell
Isolation
All animal experiments
were performed under the guidelines of Animals (Control of Experiments)
Ordinance, approved by the Committee on the Use of Human and Animal
Subjects in Teaching and Research of the Hong Kong Baptist University
and conformed to The Principles of Laboratory Animal Care (NIH publication
no. 86-23, revised 1985). Sprague–Dawley rats were obtained
from the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Hippocampus neuronal cells
were isolated from 1-day-old Sprague–Dawley rats. Briefly,
the brains were placed in cold Hank’s balanced salt solution
(HBSS; Gibco), and the hippocampus cells were extracted. The cells
were resuspended in DMEM/F-12 medium (Gibco) with 10% fetal bovine
serum (Gibco) and papain solution (Sigma-Aldrich) in 2 μg/mL
was added into the system. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C
for 20 min under gentle shaking. The solution was purified by a 0.4
μm nylon filter (BD falcon), and the filtrate was further centrifuged
at 1000 rpm for 5 min. The pellet containing the dissociated neurons
was resuspended in neurobasal medium (Gibco) with supplements 2% B-27
(B-27 Supplement 50; Gibco), 0.2% penicillin (PSN; Gibco), and 0.25%
glutamax (GlutaMAX-I 100X; Gibco). The centrifugation steps were repeated
twice. The cells were plated into a poly-d-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich)-coated
plate and incubated in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5%
CO2 for 7 days before treatment.

Cell Viability Assay
Exponentially growing SH-SY5Y
cells were plated onto 96-well plates in cell culture medium at a
density of 5 × 105 cells/mL/well. The day after plating,
the culture medium was replaced with 0.2% serum containing 24 μL
of SLM at a final concentration ranging from 700 nM to 800 μM
for determining LC50. After 24 h incubation at 37 °C, the culture
medium of each well was replaced with 100 μL of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) solution (0.25 mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) and further incubated
at 37 °C for 3 h. The MTT solution was then aspirated off, followed
by the addition of 100 μL of DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) to dissolve
the formazan crystals. The plates were agitated on a plate shaker
for 15 min, and the absorbance at 540 nm with a reference absorbance
set to 690 nm was recorded by the microplate reader (BioTek). Wells
without cells were referred to as blanks and were subtracted as background
from each sample. For the neuroprotective studies on the primary hippocampal
cells, SLM at a final concentration of 10 μM was applied together
with monomeric Aβ(1–42) at a concentration
of 10 μM. Results were expressed as the relative percentage
of control. The relative percentage of cytotoxicity was calculated
as ((MTTcontrol – MTTbg) – (MTT SLM – MTTbg))/(MTTcontrol
– MTTbg) × 100%. Three independent trials were analyzed,
and the results were expressed as the mean ± standard error of
mean (SEM).

ROS Measurement
Primary hippocampal
cells were plated onto a 96 black plate at a
density of 5 × 105 cells/mL in cell culture medium
per well. The day after plating, the culture medium was replaced with
0.2% serum, containing 100 μM 5-(and-6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein
diacetate (carboxy-DCFDA) purchased from Invitrogen (Camarillo, CA).
The medium was then incubated in dark in a humidified cell incubator
at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 30 min. The
medium was removed, and the wells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS). The cells were then resuspended in fresh culture medium
and incubated for 30 min. Afterward, the medium was replaced by SLM
together with monomeric Aβ(1–42) in 1:1 ratio
in HBSS and incubated in dark at 37 °C for 24 h. The fluorescence
intensity of cells was measured by a microplate reader (Tecan Schweiz
AG, Switzerland) with excitation/emission at 485/530 nm. The values
were expressed as fluorescence intensity ratio relative to control
(treated with monomeric Aβ(1–42) only).

In Vivo and ex Vivo Study on Blood–Brain
Barrier Permeability
First, 9-month-old APP/PS1 Tg mice with
age-matching wild-type mice as control were anesthetized under isoflurane
gas (2.0 mL/min), supplemented with oxygen (1.0 mL/min) until motionless,
then followed by the injection of 100 μL of SLM (5 mg/kg) via
the tail vein. Fluorescence imaging of the brain section was captured
by an IVIS imaging system at different postinjection time points.
All of the images were acquired using an excitation filter at ∼535
nm and an emission filter at ∼600–640 nm, with an exposure
time set at 1 s. The resultant images were further analyzed using
Living Image software. The normalized fluorescence intensity of brain
sections was obtained by dividing the radiant efficiency by the background
fluorescence of each mouse [i.e., F(t)/F(pre)] at the selected region of interest. F(t)
and F(pre) referred to the fluorescence intensity
of the time point of interest and the background fluorescence signal,
respectively. For the ThT co-staining assay, Tg mice were sacrificed
and the brain tissues of Tg mice were collected after 1 h postinjection
of SLM. The brain was then embedded in optimum cutting temperature
compound and sliced into 20 μm in thickness for micrography.
The brain slices were immersed in a solution cocktail, containing
1.0 μM ThT solution and 10% DMSO for 5 min, then washed with
40% ethanol for 2 min, and rinsed with water for 30 s. Finally, the
fluorescence images of the brain slices were recorded by laser scanning
confocal microscope, 40× oil-immersion type objective.

Animals and Experimental Procedure
The protocol that we
adopted was approved by the Animal Ethical
and Welfare Committee of Shenzhen University (Permit Number: AEWC-20140615-002)
of China. All operations were performed under ether anhydrous inhalation
of anesthesia to minimize suffering.

Animal
Model
3 × Tg-AD mice, expressing human gene mutants
APPswe, PS1M146V, and tauP301L and wild-type (WT) mice of same genetic
background, were purchased from the Jackson laboratory (BarHarbor,
ME) for breeding. Male and female mice were kept in a separated cage
with ad libitum food and water supply with 12 h light/dark cycle prior
to treatment.

Drug Administration
For the drug
treatment, the mice were divided into two groups and
each group contained ten 8-month-old male mice and nine 8-month- old
female mice. Group 1 was the control 3 × Tg mice; they received
daily intraperitoneal injection of 100 μL PB, whereas group
2 (3 × Tg mice) received daily intraperitoneal injection of 100
μL SLM at 2.25 mg/kg for 45 days. All procedures followed institutional
guidelines and were approved by the local state authorities for animal
welfare.

Morris Water Maze Test
After treatment,
the spatial reference memory of the mice was examined
by Morris water maze. The test generally consisted of three parts:
(i) 1 day training, where the mice were placed in a 26–29 °C
circular aluminum tank (1.5 m in diameter). The tank was virtually
divided into four quadrants (north, east, south, and west) and a visible
platform (10 cm in diameter), which is 1 cm higher than the water
surface. The mice were placed in one of the quadrants. During the
training, the mice could find and escape onto the platform. If the
mouse failed to find the platform within 60 s, it was manually guided
to the platform and allowed to stay on the platform for 10 s. (ii)
After the training, the mice were then placed in the same circular
platform to perform a 5-day hidden platform test. (iii) Probe trials
were performed on day 7 (24 h) and day 9 (72 h). The platform was
removed, and the mice were placed in the quadrant of the pool, which
was located opposite to the previous platform quadrant. All of the
behavior of the mice, including the distance traveled to the target
quadrant and the number of times they passed the platform, was recorded
by automated video tracking system, and the data were analyzed by
two-way ANOVA.

Protein Extraction
from the Brain
After the behavioral study, the mice were
killed under anesthesia. Half of the brains were immediately removed,
and hippocampus was separated from cortex carefully and the tissues
were frozen on ice, stored at −80 °C prior to western
blot analysis. To analyze the protein content in the cortex and hippocampus
region, the brain sections were first lysed by ultrasonic fragmentation
for 1 min in buffer solution (cell lysis buffer for western blot and
IP; Beyotime; Shanghai, China) with protease (1:200, PMSF; Beyotime,
Shanghai, China) and phosphatase (1:100, PhosSTOP; Roche, Basel, Switzerland)
inhibitors. Tissue extracts were centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 30
min, and the supernatants were collected for further analysis.

Western
Blot
The protein content
in the brain lysates were determined by the BCA protein assay kit
(Beyotime, China), and 30 μg of proteins were resolved in a
12% SDS–PAGE gel, then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane
in the range of 45–90 min, according to molecular weight of
the protein. For antibody staining, the membrane was first blocked
with 5% skim milk to reduce nonspecific binding, followed by the overnight
incubation with the corresponding diluted primary antibodies (see Table S1) at 4 °C. Afterward, the membrane
was washed thrice and further incubated with corresponding secondary
1:5000 diluted antibodies, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated
immunoglobulin (IgG) antimouse (1:5000; Neobioscience, China), and
antirabbit (1:5000; Neobioscience, China). The supersignal chemiluminescent
substrate (Thermo) was added to visualize HRP activity on Fuji films
(GE Healthcare, U.K.). The protein concentrations in the immunoblots
were determined by software Quantity One. The statistical significance
of the test was performed by using t-test analysis
function in GraphPad Prism 5.0. Data were presented as the mean +
standard error of mean (SEM) with 95% confidence interval (Table 1).

Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence
The brains obtained in the previous section (Materials
and Methods section) were bisected in the mid-sagittal plane.
The left hemisphere was fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 24–36
h and soaked in different concentrations of ethanol (30, 50, 75, 85,
95, and 100%). Tissues were moved to xylene and were then paraffin-embedded.
Immunohistochemistry was performed on 5 μm sagittal paraffin
sections. The sections were then treated with 0.3% H2O2 in 0.01 M PBS to block endogenous peroxidases and incubated
with 70% formic acid for 3 min. The sections were then treated with
fetal calf serum for 15 min at room temperature to block any nonspecific
binding, followed by the immunostaining of mouse polyclonal antibodies
against Aβ(1–42) (1:300; Cell Signaling Technology)
overnight at 4 °C. After incubation, the slices were rinsed thrice
with PBS. Subsequently, tissues were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated
Fab fragments of goat antimouse immunoglobulin (IgG) (H_L) for 2 h
(1:500; Invitrogen). After several washes, tissues were mounted using
an antifading mounting medium and air-dried away from light for confocal
imaging. For immune-fluorescent staining, slices were incubated with
tau-5 specific primary antibody (1:300, Abcam) overnight at 4 °C,
followed by high-temperature heating to repair antigen. After incubation,
the slices were rinsed thrice with PBS. Tissues were then incubated
with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated Fab fragments of goat antimouse immunoglobulin
(IgG) (H_L) for 2 h (1:500; Invitrogen). After several washes, tissues
were mounted using an antifading mounting medium and air-dried for
confocal imaging.
