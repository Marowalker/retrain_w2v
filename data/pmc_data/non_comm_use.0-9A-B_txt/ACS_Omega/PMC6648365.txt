The
hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of vegetable oil and fatty acid is
extremely important for the sustainable production of diesel-range
hydrocarbons. The present work depicts the role of Ni/Mo (mole) in
the performance of alumina-supported NiMo catalysts for the HDO of
stearic acid. Both Ni and NiMo alloy coexist in the NiMo catalysts
depending on the Ni and Mo content. With increasing Ni/Mo (mole),
the NiMo alloy content in the catalyst increases with the simultaneous
decrease in the Ni content. The activity of NiMo catalysts thus enhances
with increasing Ni/Mo (mole). The reaction follows a decarbonylation
route over Ni sites and a HDO route over NiMo alloy species. C17 and C18 alkanes are thus observed as the dominating
hydrocarbon product over Ni and NiMo alloy-rich catalysts, respectively.
The activity of the NiMo catalyst further enhances with increasing
reaction temperature and metal (Ni + Mo) loading. The selectivity
to alkanes was, however, not affected by metal loading. A suitable
kinetic model was further established based on the reaction mechanism
to relate the kinetic data.

1 Introduction
In
the past few decades, considerable attention has been devoted
to renewable resources to reduce dependency on finite fossil fuels.
These efforts are intended to achieve energy security of the world
in a sustainable manner. The renewable resources also play an important
role in preserving a healthy environment. Currently, transportation
fuels consume about 28% of the world’s energy.1 A significant effort has thus been made to produce transportation
fuels from renewable carbon-neutral resources such as biomass. The
use of biomass for biofuels will further boost the growth of agriculture-based
industries and improvement in the rural economy. Several national-level
policies are thus framed to promote biofuels. For example, India targeted
about 20% blending of biofuels (bioethanol and biodiesel) with transportation
fuels.2 Following the 2nd commitment of
the Kyoto protocol, the countries are now targeting 18% reduction
of greenhouse gas emission between 2013 and 2020.3

Three different classes of biomass are used in the
biorefinery:
triglycerides, sugar and starch, and lignocellulosic. Among these,
the triglyceride is simple in structure with low functionality and
oxygen content and a long-chain linear hydrocarbon backbone.1 The triglycerides are mainly composed of C16 and C18 fatty acids.4 Hence, it is an ideal feedstock for the diesel-range transportation
fuel. Transesterification is one such well-accepted technology for
the production of transportation fuels from triglycerides known as
biodiesel. A significant advancement has thus been made in the production
of biodiesel from triglycerides.5 The biodiesel
has, however, the maximum limit of 20% blending with diesel for application
in unmodified combustion engines because of its unfavorable cold flow
properties. Furthermore, it delivers lower fuel mileage because of
the presence of oxygen in the structure.5 The removal of oxygen from triglycerides is thus vital in producing
diesel-range hydrocarbons (green diesel) for direct use in a diesel
engine. The pyrolysis and catalytic cracking are two potential processes
in the production of green diesel from triglycerides.6 However, these processes provide a low yield of green diesel
and high yield of gaseous products.

Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO)
is another process for the manufacturing
of green diesel from triglycerides in high yield. This process is
analogous to the hydroprocessing technology used in the petroleum
refinery and carried out over supported metal catalysts in the presence
of hydrogen.7 The likelihood of the retrofitting
with petroleum refinery production facilities is an added advantage
of this process.8 The triglycerides can
be converted to green diesel through two alternative approaches: direct
HDO of triglycerides and HDO of fatty acids derived from triglycerides.
In the latter approach, the triglycerides are generally (catalytically
or noncatalytically) hydrolyzed to corresponding fatty acids.9 Following the latter approach, the present work
is focused on the HDO of stearic acid (C17–COOH)
as a model fatty acid.

A vast number of works have been reported
in the past on the HDO
of numerous model fatty acids such as decanoic, dodecanoic, lauric,
palmitic, stearic, oleic, and linoleic.4,10−18 Similar to hydrotreatment, the sulfided form of supported metal
catalysts has also been employed for the HDO of vegetable oil and
fatty acids.13,19−21 These catalysts
are, however, accompanied with sulfur contamination of green diesel
and deactivation because of sulfur leaching.22 The sulfur-free-supported metal catalysts have thus attracted huge
attention for this process. HDO has also been studied over noble metal
(Pt, Pd, Ru, etc.) catalysts.23−28 For example, Pd/C demonstrated high catalytic activity for the HDO
of fatty acids.24 These catalysts are,
however, highly expensive. On the other hand, the transition metals
(Ni, Co, NiMo, and CoMo) are inexpensive with high catalytic activity
and stability. Hence, these catalysts have been reported extensively
for this reaction by various research groups.4,29−34 For example, HDO of C17–COOH was studied over
SiO2, γ-Al2O3, and HZSM-5-supported
Ni catalyst.4 The C17 alkane
was reported as the main product over Ni/γ-Al2O3. The HY, γ-Al2O3, and SiO2-supported Ni catalysts were also reported for the HDO of
C17–COOH and conversion of C17–COOH
of 94, 43, and 46% was achieved at 90 min of reaction time, respectively.35

The deoxygenation pathway depends on the
nature of active sites
present in the catalyst. The decarbonylation pathway is dominant over
Ni catalysts. This route produces alkane with one carbon less than
the fatty acid.4,17,35 The reaction, however, follows the HDO pathway over bimetallic catalysts
(NiMo and CoMo).36 The nonsulfided NiMo/γ-Al2O3 showed the higher yield of green diesel from
sunflower oil and waste cooking oil compared to the sulfided catalyst.37 The nonsulfided CoMo/γ-Al2O3 catalyst showed high catalytic activity with 100% hydrocarbon
product containing 74% paraffin from sunflower oil.

The atomic
composition of Ni and Mo in the supported NiMo catalyst
is a governing factor to obtain the catalytically active NiMo alloy
species.33,37−39 Wang et al. studied
the effect of Ni/Mo (mole) and metal loading on structure, reducibility,
and metal dispersion.40 The detailed study
on Ni/Mo (mole) is, however, scarcely available in the literature.
The present work is thus focused on the preparation of alumina-supported
NiMo catalysts with different Ni/Mo (mole). These catalysts were further
characterized by several techniques to understand the formation of
various active surface species. The HDO activity and product selectivity
over these catalysts were then qualitatively correlated with the structural
information. For optimum Ni/Mo (mole), the study was then extended
to different metal (Ni + Mo) loadings to obtain the optimum metal
loading. The kinetics play an important role in the reactor design.4,25,40−42 The kinetics
of HDO over monometallic catalysts were reported by various research
groups in the past.4,24,41,43,44 The kinetic
model for the HDO of fatty acids over the bimetallic catalyst is,
however, scarcely available in the literature. Hence, a suitable kinetic
model was developed in this work for the HDO of C17–COOH
over the alumina-supported NiMo catalyst.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Catalyst Characterization
2.1.1 BET Surface Area
Table 1 shows Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area and pore volume of γ-Al2O3 and NiMo catalysts. The surface area of γ-Al2O3 was 243 m2/g with a pore volume of 0.86
cm3/g. Both calcined and reduced NiMo catalysts showed
lesser surface area and pore volume compared to γ-Al2O3. The surface area of both calcined and reduced NiMo
catalysts was further decreased with increasing Mo content and metal
(Ni + Mo) loading. The drop in surface area with increasing Mo content
and metal loading might be due to the greater coverage of the alumina
surface or pore blockage by the high atomic weight Mo (and/or Ni)
metal/metal oxide species. Excepting 4.1MoAl, the surface area of
the reduced NiMo catalyst was, however, lower than that of the corresponding
calcined catalyst. It might be due to the additional sintering of
metals during reduction. In the case of 4.1MoAl, the MoO3 clusters were formed during calcination. During reduction, these
MoO3 clusters were reduced to dispersed Mo or molybdenum
oxide, resulting in a slight increase in the surface area.40

2.1.2 Pulse Chemisorption
The metal dispersion
and metallic surface area of NiMo catalysts were declined with increasing
Mo content and metal (Ni + Mo) loading in the catalyst (Table 1). It might be due to the enrichment
of MoO3 clusters with increasing Mo content, leading to
the formation of Al2(MoO4)3. The
Raman spectra further confirmed the presence of Al2(MoO4)3 in the calcined NiMo catalyst (Figure 1). Giordano et al. also reported
augmentation of the MoO3 cluster with increasing MoO3 content on alumina.45 The decrease
in metal dispersion and metallic surface area with increasing metal
loading might be due to agglomeration of metals at higher metal loading.

spectra of calcined NiMo and Mo catalysts.

2.1.3 Raman Spectroscopy
Figure 1 shows Raman spectra of calcined
NiMo catalysts under ambient conditions. Raman bands at ∼993,
1004, and 1026 cm–1 were characteristics of Mo=O
bond vibration of three MoO4 units present in Al2(MoO4)3. Tian et al. also observed similar
bands in Raman spectra of bulk Al2(MoO4)346 and reference therein. The Raman
bands at 822, 889, and 915 cm–1 were attributed
to the asymmetric stretching of three MoO4 units present
in Al2(MoO4)346 and reference therein. These bands became intense with
increasing Mo content. These results implied the enrichment of Al2(MoO4)3 with increasing Mo content in
the NiMo catalyst. The bands appeared at 434 and 378 cm–1 were due to asymmetric and symmetric bending modes of isolated MoO4 units. Raman bands at 709 and 964 cm–1 were
attributed to the NiMoO4 species.47 These bands were observed in all calcined NiMo catalysts. Moreover,
these bands became sharp and intense with increasing Mo content in
the NiMo catalyst. The strong MoO4 bands in 1.0Ni3.1MoAl
suggested a high concentration of Al2(MoO4)3. Liu et al. also reported similar observation.48 For the NiMo catalyst, the Raman bands corresponding
to bridging Mo–O–Mo bonds were absent in the Raman shift
region of 200–300 and 500–800 cm–1. These results further confirmed the presence of different isolated
MoO4 units of Al2(MoO4).46

2.1.4 UV–Vis–NIR
Spectra
Figure S2 shows UV–vis
spectra
of calcined NiMo catalysts. The UV–vis band appeared at 263
nm was assigned to the O2– to Mo6+ ligand
to metal charge transfer of the isolated MoO4 units present
in Al2(MoO4)3.46 The UV–vis absorption band at 263 nm in 4.1MoAl
is relatively strong compared to that in the NiMo catalysts. This
band became intense with increasing Mo content in NiMo catalysts.
This result shows that the formation of Al2(MoO4)3 was increased with increasing Mo content in the NiMo
catalyst. The UV–vis band appeared at 621 nm was attributed
to NiAl2O4.43 This
band was intense in 3.1Ni1.0MoAl. This result indicated that the formation
of NiAl2O4 was increased with an increase in
the Ni/Mo (mole).

2.1.5 Powder XRD
Figure 2A shows powder X-ray
diffraction (XRD) pattern
of calcined NiMo catalysts. The characteristic diffraction peaks at
2θ of 45° (4 0 0) and 65.5° (4 4 0) corresponded to
the NiAl2O4 species [PDF#781601]. The previous
studies also reported NiAl2O4 in the Ni/alumina
catalyst.49,50 NiAl2O4 is, however,
very difficult to distinguish from γ-Al2O3 [45.8° (4 0 0) and 67.3° (2 2 0)] because of overlapping
diffraction peaks. The broad peaks at 2θ of 45°–47°
and 65°–67° were thus considered as the combined
diffraction peak of NiAl2O4 and γ-Al2O3. The broad peaks appeared at 2θ of 37°–38°
were considered as combined diffraction peaks of NiO and NiAl2O4. The calcined NiMo catalysts revealed characteristic
NiO peaks at 2θ of 37.16° (1 1 1), 43.54° (2 0 0),
and 62.98° (2 2 0) [PDF#750197].4,51 The intensity
of NiO peaks at 2θ of 37.16° and 43.54° was increased
with increasing Ni/Mo (mole) and practically disappeared in 1.7Ni2.4MoAl
and 1.0Ni3.1MoAl. The MoO3 diffraction peaks appeared at
2θ of 20.81° (1 1 1), 23.15° (0 0 2), 23.30°
(0 2 0), 23.49° (2 0 0), and 26.3° (2 1 0) [PDF#800347].51−53 These peaks became intense with increasing Mo content in the catalyst.
The calcined NiMo catalysts additionally showed NiMoO4 species
diffraction peaks at 2θ of 24.28° (0 1 1), 25.46°
(1 1 0), and 31.15° (1 1 1) [PDF#860362]. The NiMoO4 species was also reported in previous studies.54,55 The NiMoO4 species peaks were sharp and intense for 2.4Ni1.7MoAl
and weak for both higher and lower Mo content in the catalyst. The
intensity of the characteristic NiO and NiMoO4 species
peaks was increased with increasing metal loading as shown in Figure S1. The characteristic NiO peak at 2θ
of 43.58° (2 0 0) was absent in 0.9Ni0.6MoAl (Figure S1). It might be due to the existence of dispersed
NiO below the detection limit of powder XRD or NiO was completely
consumed for the formation of NiMoO4 species.

with different Ni/Mo mole ratios.

Figure 2B
shows
the powder XRD pattern of reduced NiMo catalysts. The reduced 4.1NiAl
showed three characteristic Ni peaks at 2θ of 44.48° (1
1 1), 51.83° (2 0 0), and 76.352° (2 2 0) [PDF#701849].4,51 The intensity of Ni peaks was decreased gradually with decreasing
Ni/Mo (mole) and disappeared in 1.0Ni3.1MoAl. It might be due to complete
consumption of Ni in the formation of NiMoO4 or the crystallite
size of Ni was below the detection limit of powder XRD. Wang et al.
also reported an increase in the intensity of the NiMoO4 diffraction peak with decreasing Ni/Mo (mole).40 The reduced 4.1MoAl showed Mo peaks at 2θ of 40.47°
(1 1 0) and molybdenum dioxide (MoO2) at 2θ of 26.26°
(1 1 1) and 37.21° (2 0 0). The reduced 3.1Ni1.0MoAl displayed
diffraction peaks of the NiMo alloy (Mo1.24Ni0.76) at 2θ of 40.63° (4 0 1), 43.73° (3 1 3), and 45.58°
(2 0 4) [PDF#471129]. These peaks were intensified with the increasing
Mo content up to 1.7Ni2.4MoAl and decreased slightly with the further
increase in Mo content (1.0Ni3.1MoAl). The intensity of NiMo alloy
diffraction peaks was increased with increasing metal loading as shown
in Figure S1. Mo and MoO2 were,
however, not observed in reduced NiMo catalysts. This result implies
that the presence of Ni enhances the reducibility of MoO2. The absence of Mo diffraction peaks might be due to complete consumption
of Mo in the formation of the NiMo alloy or the quantity of Mo was
below the detection limit of powder XRD. NiAl2O4 was observed at 2θ of 37.16°. The intensity of this peak
was weak for all the catalysts. The peak associated with Ni was also
observed in 1.8Ni1.2MoAl and 2.4Ni1.7MoAl (Figure S1).

2.1.6 Temperature-Programmed
Reduction (TPR) Profile
Figure 3 shows the
temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) profile of calcined NiMo catalysts.
4.1NiAl exhibited three characteristic reduction peaks at Tmax of 657, 703, and 1014 K. The first peak
at ∼657 K was characteristics of the reduction of bulk NiO
with a weak interaction with support. The bulk NiO reduction peak
was, however, absent in all NiMo catalysts excepting 3.1Ni1.0MoAl.
The bulk NiO reduction peak in 3.1Ni1.0MoAl was observed at a slightly
lower temperature than the corresponding peak in 4.1NiAl. The second
reduction peak at ∼703 K was due to the reduction of dispersed
NiO with a strong interaction with the support. The third high-temperature
reduction peak at ∼1014 K was attributed to the reduction of
NiAl2O4. NiAl2O4 was also
observed in the powder XRD pattern of the calcined Ni catalyst (Figure 2). The reducible
NiAl2O4 was observed in the calcined NiMo catalyst
with high Ni content only (3.1Ni1.0MoAl). NiAl2O4 was also reported by Li et al. at Tmax of 1064 K and Kumar et al. at Tmax of
950 K.4,56

(A) Ni/Mo mole ratio
and (B) metals loading.

4.1MoAl displayed three characteristic reduction peaks at Tmax of 694, 796, and ∼989 K. The first
reduction peak was associated with the partial reduction of MoO3 to MoO2. The second reduction peak was due to
the reduction of MoO2 to Mo. The reduction peak at ∼989
K might be due to the reduction of Al2(MoO4)3.57 The presence of Al2(MoO4)3 in 4.1MoAl and NiMo catalysts with
high Mo content was also confirmed by Raman spectroscopy as discussed
in the previous section.

The calcined NiMo catalysts exhibited
four distinct reduction peaks
at Tmax of 661–695, 750–774,
886–891, and 989–1058 K depending on Ni/Mo (mole) and
metal loading. The dispersed NiO, MoO3, and NiMoO4 are reduced over a narrow temperature range (Figure 3A), and hence, their reduction peaks are
often indistinguishable. The first reduction peak at 661–695
K was thus considered as the simultaneous reduction of dispersed NiO,
MoO3, and NiMoO4. For the NiMo catalyst with
high Ni content such as 3.1Ni1.0MoAl, this peak was weak and broad.
On the other hand, the MoO3 diffraction peak was weak in
calcined 3.1Ni1.0MoAl (Figure 2). Therefore, this reduction peak might be attributed to the
simultaneous reduction of dispersed NiO and NiMoO4 in 3.1Ni1.0MoAl.
For the NiMo catalyst with moderate Ni and Mo content such as 2.4Ni1.7MoAl
and 1.7Ni2.4MoAl, this reduction peak was sharp and intense. The powder
XRD pattern of these catalysts revealed the weak diffraction peaks
of MoO3 and NiO. This reduction peak for these catalysts
was thus due to the reduction of NiMoO4 predominately.
The NiMoO4 diffraction peak also became sharp and intense
with decreasing Ni/Mo (mole) with the simultaneous decline in intensity
of the NiO peak (Figure 2). A similar observation was also reported by Wang et al..40 This reduction peak was also intense and sharp
in the NiMo catalyst with different metal loading (Figure 3B). The Tmax of this peak was, however, increased with increasing metal
loading. This reduction peak was, however, broad with a shoulder in
the NiMo catalyst with high Mo content such as 1.0Ni3.1MoAl and attributed
to the reduction of both MoO3 and NiMoO4.

The second peak appeared in the NiMo catalyst at 750–774
K was due to the reduction of MoO2 to Mo. This peak was
practically absent in 3.1Ni1.0MoAl and quite weak for all NiMo catalysts
excepting 1.0Ni3.1MoAl. The peak appeared at 886–891 K was
attributed to the reduction of intermediate reducible phases. The
reduction temperature of NiAl2O4 and Al2(MoO4)3 is quite close. The broad peak
appeared in the NiMo catalyst at 989–1058 K was thus considered
as the simultaneous reduction of NiAl2O4 and
Al2(MoO4)3. This reduction peak was,
however, quite significant in the NiMo catalyst with high Ni content
such as 3.1Ni1.0MoAl and considered as the reduction of NiAl2O4 mainly. The Tmax of this
reduction peak was further decreased slightly with increasing Mo content
in the NiMo catalyst.

2.2 Reaction Pathway
In general, the
fatty acids are reduced to fatty alcohol by hydrogen in presence of
metallic catalysts. A significant quantity of octadecanol (C18–OH) was also observed during this study. The deoxygenation
of C18–OH then follows two different reaction pathways
(RPs) depending on the nature of the active centers present in the
catalysts: (i) HDO, where oxygen is eliminated as water (RP-I) and
(ii) decarbonylation, where oxygen is removed as CO (RP-II) (Scheme 1).13,21,38,58 Following
RP-I, C18–OH undergoes dehydration, followed by
hydrogenation to form a C18 alkane. RP-I is the dominant
route over the NiMo catalyst. On the basis of the characterization
of the NiMo catalysts, it is speculated that this route follows over
NiMo alloy species. In RP-II, C18–OH undergoes dehydrogenation
to form octadecanal (C17–CHO). C17–CHO
then undergoes decarbonylation to form a C17 alkane. A
small quantity of C17–CHO was detected during the
reaction. This route follows over the metallic sites and dominant
over the Ni catalyst.

2.3.1 Effect of the Ni/Mo Mole
Ratio
For a fixed metal (Ni + Mo) loading of 4.1 mmol/g,
Ni/Mo (mole) was
varied to understand its role in the catalytic performance. The conversion
of C17–COOH was about 65% over 4.1NiAl at 360 min
of reaction time (Figure 4A). The conversion of C17–COOH was improved
with increasing Ni/Mo (mole). Almost complete conversion of C17–COOH was achieved over 2.4Ni1.7MoAl and 3.1Ni1.0MoAl
at 240 min of reaction time. The initial reaction rate over different
catalysts was as follows: 4.5 × 10–6, 8.2 ×
10–6, 1.5 × 10–5, 2.6 ×
10–5, and 3.1 × 10–5 kmol/m3 s for 4.1NiAl, 1.0Ni3.1MoAl, 1.7Ni2.4MoAl, 2.4Ni1.7MoAl,
and 3.1Ni1.0MoAl, respectively. With respect to 4.1NiAl, the initial
reaction rate enhancement factors were 1.8, 3.3, 5.7, and 6.9 for
1.0Ni3.1MoAl, 1.7Ni2.4MoAl, 2.4Ni1.7MoAl, and 3.1Ni1.0MoAl, respectively.
The HDO of C17–COOH was also performed using 4.1MoAl
under similar reaction conditions. The conversion of C17–COOH was, however, negligible over 4.1MoAl. The higher catalytic
activity of NiMo compared to that of the Ni catalyst was thus mainly
due to the synergetic effect of Ni and Mo and formation of highly
active NiMo alloy species. The powder XRD pattern also revealed the
presence of NiMo alloy and NiMoO4 species in reduced and
calcined NiMo catalysts, respectively (Figure 2). Raman spectra further confirmed the existence
of NiMoO4 species in calcined NiMo catalysts (Figure 1). The presence of
catalytically inactive bulk Ni in 4.1NiAl might be an additional factor
for its lower catalytic activity (Figure 3A).

of stearic acid and
(B) wt % of alkane product at various conversions of stearic acid.
Reaction conditions: concentration of stearic acid = 0.18 kmol/m3, n-dodecane = 100 mL, catalysts = 0.5 (w/v)
%, 543 K, and initial hydrogen pressure = 20 bars.

For the NiMo catalyst with high Ni content such
as 3.1Ni1.0MoAl
and 2.4Ni1.7MoAl, both Ni and NiMo alloy species coexist as observed
from powder XRD (Figure 2B). The catalytic activity of these catalysts was thus due to both
Ni and NiMo alloy species. On the other hand, the NiMo catalyst with
high Mo content (1.7Ni2.4MoAl and 1.0Ni3.1MoAl), only NiMo alloy species
was observed in powder XRD (Figure 2B). The catalytic activity of these catalysts was thus
mainly due to NiMo alloy species. The TPR profile of the NiMo catalyst
too showed that the reduction peak corresponding to NiMoO4 species was weak for both high and low Ni content (3.1Ni1.0MoAl
and 1.0Ni3.1MoAl) and quite intense for moderate Ni and Mo content
(2.4Ni1.7MoAl and 1.7Ni2.4MoAl) (Figure 3A). The increasing trend of catalytic activity
of the NiMo catalyst with increasing Ni content up to 2.4Ni1.7MoAl
was thus due to the enrichment of highly active NiMo alloy species.
The activity of 3.1Ni1.0MoAl was, however, not enhanced much compared
to 2.4Ni1.7MoAl as observed from the initial reaction rate enhancement
factor.

Table 2 shows the
effect of Ni/Mo (mole) on the product distribution for a fixed conversion
of C17–COOH. For 4.1NiAl, the C17 alkane
was the primary hydrocarbon product with an insignificant quantity
of the C18 alkane. This result indicates that the reaction
primarily follows the decarbonylation pathway over the Ni catalyst.
On the other hand, the wt % of the C18 alkane was increased
with increasing Mo content in NiMo catalysts with the simultaneous
decrease in the C17 alkane. The C17 alkane was
the dominated hydrocarbon product for NiMo catalysts with high Ni
content such as 3.1Ni1.0MoAl and 2.4Ni1.7MoAl. The C18 alkane
was, however, observed as the leading hydrocarbon product for the
NiMo catalyst with high Mo content such as 1.7Ni2.4MoAl and 1.0Ni3.1MoAl.
Powder XRD of the reduced NiMo catalyst exhibited the decline in intensity
of Ni diffraction peaks with increasing Mo content and disappeared
in 1.0Ni3.1MoAl (Figure 2B). On the other hand, the NiMo alloy diffraction peaks were intensified
with increasing Mo content up to 2.4Ni1.7MoAl (Figure 2B). These results indicate that the reaction
follows two different pathways simultaneously over two different active
sites present in the NiMo catalyst. The reaction follows the decarbonylation
pathway over the Ni sites and HDO route over NiMo alloy species.

as Figure 4.

At 65% conversion of C17–COOH, the wt % of C18–OH was quite high
with the insignificant quantity
of alkanes over NiMo catalysts (Table 2). Moreover, the wt % of C18–OH was
enhanced with increasing Mo content in the catalyst. For a better
understanding of catalytic activity, the wt % of alkane (C15–C18) product at various conversions of C17–COOH was calculated as presented in Figure 4B. The NiMo catalyst with the highest Mo
content (1.0Ni3.1MoAl) exhibited the lowest catalytic activity for
converting intermediate oxygenated compounds (C18–OH
and C17–CHO) to alkanes. The catalytic activity
toward alkanes was increased with increasing Ni content in the NiMo
catalyst. Despite the lowest conversion of C17–COOH
(Figure 4A), 4.1NiAl
showed the highest catalytic activity toward alkanes. This result
shows that reduction of C17–COOH to C18–OH is quite fast over NiMo alloy species compared to Ni sites
of the catalyst, leading to the higher conversion of C17–COOH over NiMo catalysts. The conversion of C18–OH to alkanes is, however, relatively fast over Ni center
than NiMo alloy species, resulting in higher wt % of the alkane product
over the Ni catalyst. A small quantity of C17–CHO
was further noticed over the NiMo catalyst. C17–CHO
was, however, absent over 4.1NiAl. It might be due to the faster rate
of decarbonylation of C17–CHO over Ni center of
the catalyst.

The optimum Ni/Mo (mole) in the NiMo catalyst
can be deduced based
on either catalytic activity or selectivity to hydrocarbon products.
3.1Ni1.0MoAl showed the highest catalytic activity (Figure 4), and hence, it might appear
as the best catalyst. On the other hand, the C17 alkane
was the leading hydrocarbon product over 3.1Ni1.0MoAl and 2.4Ni1.7MoAl
(decarbonylation route), whereas the C18 alkane was the
dominating hydrocarbon product over 1.7Ni2.4MoAl and 1.0Ni3.1MoAl
(HDO route) (Table 2). Therefore, 3.1Ni1.0MoAl and 1.0Ni3.1MoAl may apparently be deliberated
as the suitable catalysts for C17 and C18 alkane-rich
products, respectively. The formation of the C17 alkane
is, however, associated with loss of one carbon with a slightly lower
yield of green diesel. On the basis of this factor, 1.0Ni3.1MoAl may
be considered as the appropriate catalyst for selective HDO of fatty
acids. The decarbonylation route, however, consumes less hydrogen
than the HDO route (Scheme 1). On the basis of this consideration, 3.1Ni1.0MoAl may be
considered as the suitable catalyst for selective decarbonylation
of fatty acids. On the other hand, green diesel with mixed hydrocarbons
is desirable to obtain better fuel properties. The ratio of C17/C18 was about 1.3 over 2.4Ni1.7MoAl. Therefore,
2.4Ni1.7MoAl was considered as the optimum catalyst in the present
study. Ni/Mo (mole) of 3:2 was thus considered for the remaining studies.

2.3.2 Effect of Metal Loading
For a fixed
Ni/Mo (mole) of 3:2, metal (Ni + Mo) loading in the NiMo catalyst
was varied to obtain optimum metal loading. Figure 5 shows the conversion of C17–COOH
over these catalysts. The conversion of C17–COOH
was improved with increasing metal loading. At 60 min of reaction
time, the conversion of C17–COOH was about 41% over
0.9Ni0.6MoAl and reached about 72% for 2.4Ni1.7MoAl. The initial reaction
rates were 1.5 × 10–5, 1.7 × 10–5, 1.9 × 10–5, and 2.6 × 10–5 kmol/m3 s over 0.9Ni0.6MoAl, 1.2Ni0.8MoAl, 1.8Ni1.2MoAl,
and 2.4Ni1.7MoAl, respectively. The initial reaction rate enhancement
factors were 1.1, 1.3, and 1.8 for increasing metal loading from 1.5
to 4.1 mmol/g alumina, respectively. The increase in catalytic activity
with increasing metal loading was due to the increase in active sites
(Ni and NiMo alloy species) in the reduced NiMo catalyst (Figure S1B). The increase in the concentration
of Ni and NiMo alloy species with increasing metal loading is also
reflected by the increasing trend of the metallic surface area per
gram of the catalyst (Table 1). Table 3 shows
the effect of metal loading on wt % of products. The wt % of C18–OH was dropped with increasing metal loading with
the simultaneous increase in wt % of alkanes. The catalytic activity
was enhanced with increasing metal loading, leading to the increase
in the conversion of C18–OH to alkanes. The product
distribution was, however, practically unaffected by metal loading
excepting 2.4Ni1.7MoAl. The wt % of the C17 alkane was,
however, dominated over 2.4Ni1.7MoAl. It may be due to the appreciable
amount of Ni in 2.4Ni1.7MoAl, which is responsible for the decarbonylation
route. The Ni was detected in powder XRD of reduced 2.4Ni1.7MoAl and
1.8Ni1.2MoAl only (Figure S1B).

2.3.3 Reproducibility,
Recyclability, and Regeneration
Ability of 2.4Ni1.7MoAl
Two separate reaction runs were conducted
under similar reaction conditions to demonstrate the reproducibility
of reaction results as shown in Table 4. The conversion of C17–COOH and
product distribution was almost similar in these two reaction runs.
These results confirmed the repeatability of reaction results. To
check the recyclability, the spent catalyst from these reaction mixtures
was filtered and repeatedly washed with ethanol to remove adsorbed
organic compounds. The filtered catalyst was then dried overnight
at 373 K. Another reaction run was then carried out using this dried
spent catalyst. The conversion of C17–COOH over
the dried spent catalyst was much lesser than the fresh catalyst.
The lower catalytic activity of the dried spent catalyst might be
due to the carbonaceous deposition on the active sites. The dried
spent catalyst was then regenerated by calcination and reduction at
973 K. The activity of this regenerated spent catalyst was subsequently
tested for the HDO of C17–COOH. The conversion of
C17–COOH and wt % of products over the regenerated
spent catalyst was quite similar to that of the fresh catalyst (Table 4). These results demonstrate
the regeneration ability of the NiMo catalyst for the HDO of C17–COOH.

2.4 Kinetic
Model
In this work, we proposed
a kinetic model for the HDO of C17–COOH (A) over
NiMo catalysts based on the reaction of Scheme 1. The reaction was assumed as first order
with respect to compounds in the liquid phase and partial pressure
of hydrogen (pH2). The dehydrogenation
of C18–OH (B) to C17–CHO (C) is
a reversible reaction. However, we observed only a small quantity
of C17–CHO in this work. This was due to the faster
rate of the decarbonylation reaction. A pseudo-steady-state hypothesis
was thus adopted for the calculation of C17–CHO
concentration during the reaction (eq 1). 1  

Equations 2–5 show the rate of formation
of A, B, C18 alkane (D), and C17 alkane (E),
respectively. 2   3   4   5  

We calculated the equilibrium
constant (keq) of the C18–OH
dehydrogenation reaction
based on standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG298K0 = 34.7
kJ/mol): ΔG298K0 = −RT ln(keq). The hydrogen is consumed in the HDO of C17–COOH. The partial pressure of hydrogen thus reduces with
the progress of the reaction. It was calculated based on the following
equation: 6  where v and V represent the volume of liquid
and gas, respectively.

The rate constants of the kinetic model
were calculated using kinetic
data by a nonlinear regression algorithm. The ordinary differential
equations (eqs 2–5) were integrated using the RK4 method. The rate
constants were estimated by minimizing the below objective function. 7  

2.5 Kinetic Studies
HDO of C17–COOH was
carried out at five different temperatures (493–553
K) over 2.4Ni1.7MoAl as shown in Figure 6. The conversion of C17–COOH
was enhanced with increasing reaction temperature as expected. The
conversion of C17–COOH at 60 min of reaction time
was about 20% at 493 K and increased to about 92% at 553 K. The initial
reaction rates were 8.8 × 10–6, 1.2 ×
10–5, 1.4 × 10–5, 2.6 ×
10–5, and 2.9 × 10–5 kmol/m3 s at 493, 513, 533, 543, and 553 K, respectively. With respect
to 493 K, the initial reaction rate was enhanced by factors of 1.4,
1.6, 2.9, and 3.3 for 513, 533, 543, and 553 K, respectively. The
apparent activation energy was found to be 38.7 kJ/mol from the Arrhenius
plot of ln(initial rate) versus 1/T. Table 5 shows the effect of reaction
temperature on wt % of products for a fixed conversion of C17–COOH. The wt % of C18–OH was dropped with
increasing reaction temperature with the concurrent increase in wt
% of alkanes. With increasing reaction temperature, the reaction rate
was enhanced, resulting in the increase in conversion of C18–OH to alkanes.

a All reaction conditions are same
as Figure 6.

The rate constants of the kinetic
model (eqs 1–7) were then
obtained based on these kinetic data. The pre-exponential factor and
activation energy were calculated using the Arrhenius law. The activation
energy for the rate constant, k1, was
quite low compared to the other rate constants (Table 6). The reduction of C17–COOH
to C18–OH is thus quite a fast reaction, resulting
in the high conversion of C17–COOH even at a low
reaction temperature. Because of high activation energy, the conversion
of C18–OH to alkanes (by decarbonylation and HDO
route) was appreciable only at higher reaction temperatures especially
at 543 K and above (Table 5). Therefore, the wt % of alkanes became significant at higher
reaction temperatures only. The conversion of C17–COOH
was further calculated based on these rate constants. The calculated
C17–COOH conversion was then matched with the reaction
results as shown in Figure 6. The calculated C17–COOH conversion matched
reasonably well with reaction results.

3 Conclusions
The NiMoO4 and NiMo alloy species were observed in calcined
and reduced NiMo catalysts, respectively. These species were significant
in NiMo catalysts with Ni/Mo (mole) of 2:3 and 3:2. On the other hand,
the Ni content was substantial in the NiMo catalyst with high Ni/Mo
(mole) and decreased gradually with the drop in Ni/Mo (mole). The
activity of the NiMo catalyst for the HDO of C17–COOH
was enhanced with increasing Ni/Mo (mole). It was due to the enrichment
of highly active NiMo alloy species with increasing Ni/Mo (mole).
The reaction followed two RPs simultaneously over two different active
centers present in the catalyst: decarbonylation over Ni and HDO over
NiMo alloy species. The C17 alkane was the primary hydrocarbon
product over 4.1NiAl. The C18 alkane was the dominating
hydrocarbon product over the NiMo catalyst with Ni/Mo (mole) of 1:3
and 2:3. The C17 alkane was, however, the leading hydrocarbon
product for higher Ni/Mo (mole). For a fixed Ni/Mo (mole), the catalytic
activity of the NiMo catalyst was enhanced with increasing metal (Ni
+ Mo) loading without altering the product distribution. A power law-based
kinetic model was established based on the proposed reaction scheme.
The activation energy was relatively low for the reduction of C17–COOH to C18–OH (12.1 kcal/mol)
compared to the decarbonylation of C17–CHO (57.2
kcal/mol) and HDO of the C18–OH (66.2 kcal/mol)
route. The wt % of alkanes was thus trivial at low reaction temperature
and enhanced with an increase in the reaction temperature.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Catalyst Preparation
Alumina (Al)-supported
NiMo catalysts are abbreviated as aNibMoAl, where a and b signify the millimoles of Ni and Mo per gram
of support, respectively. These catalysts were prepared by an incipient
wetness coimpregnation method. The metal precursors equivalent to a and b mmol/g alumina of Ni (nickel nitrate
hexahydrate, ≥97%, Merck Specialties Pvt. Ltd.) and Mo (ammonium
molybdate tetrahydrate, 99.98%, Sigma-Aldrich) were first dissolved
in distilled water. The volume of water used in this method was slightly
more than the pore volume of γ-Al2O3 (Alfa
Aesar). This solution was then added dropwise to the measured quantity
of γ-Al2O3 with constant stirring for
about 1 h. This wet catalyst was first dried at ambient temperature,
followed by drying in a hot-air oven at 373 K for about 12 h. The
dried catalyst was then calcined at 973 K for about 6 h in a muffle
furnace. The calcined catalysts were finally reduced by hydrogen at
973 K for 3 h in a tubular furnace. These catalysts are represented
as the NiMo catalyst throughout this article for simplicity of the
discussion.

4.2 Catalyst Characterization
The catalysts
were characterized to determine the specific surface area and pore
volume (Micromeritics ASAP 2020), reducibility, reduction temperature
(Tmax), metal dispersion, and metallic
surface area (Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920). For BET, the catalyst
was degassed under vacuum (10–5 Torr) at 523 K for
6 h. The nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms were measured at
77 K. The BET surface area was then calculated from nitrogen adsorption
isotherm in the relative pressure (P/P0) range of 0.05–0.3. The pore volume was considered
as the volume of liquid nitrogen adsorbed at P/P0 = 1.0 ca. For H2-TPR studies, the
calcined catalyst (20 mg) was first pretreated by argon (30 mL/min)
at 473 K for 3 h. The H2-TPR studies were then carried
out using 10 vol % H2–Ar gas mixture (30 mL/min)
in the temperature range of 323–1073 K with a heating rate
of 5 K/min. For H2-pulse chemisorption studies, the calcined
catalyst was first reduced by 10 vol % H2–Ar (30
mL/min) at 923 K for 2 h and then pretreated using pure He (30 mL/min)
at 323 K for 3 h. The H2-pulse chemisorption studies of
the reduced catalyst were then carried out at 323 K using 10 vol %
H2–Ar gas. The metal dispersion and metal surface
area were obtained from the amount of hydrogen chemisorbed.

Powder XRD pattern of the catalysts was recorded in the 2θ
range of 10–90° in a Phillips X-ray diffractometer (X-PERT
Pro PAN analytical) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418
Å) at 45 kV and 30 mA current with a scanning rate of 1°/min.
The Raman spectra of calcined catalysts were obtained under ambient
condition using a Raman spectrometer system (Bruker, Senterra) equipped
with a confocal microscope and 1200 grooves/mm grate. The samples
were excited with a 532 nm laser (20 mW), and the spectra were acquired
in the 200–1100 cm–1 region at a resolution
of 20 cm–1. A thin wafer of the pure sample was
made for Raman analysis. UV–vis–NIR spectra of the calcined
NiMo catalysts were recorded in a UV–vis–NIR spectrometer
(PerkinElmer UV–vis–NIR spectrometer, Lamda-1050) equipped
with diffuse reflectance accessories (Harrick scientific Products
Inc., USA) in the wavelength range of 250–800 nm using BaSO4 as a reference under ambient condition.

4.3 Reaction Setup and Procedure
Catalytic
HDO of C17–COOH (≥97%, Merck Specialties
Pvt. Ltd.) was studied in a high-pressure batch reactor. The reactor
is enclosed in an electrically heated furnace. The reactor consists
of a four-blade impeller, a thermocouple, and a temperature and rotations
per minute regulator. The reactor was maintained within ±1 K
using a PID temperature controller. For a typical reaction, 5 g of
C17–COOH (0.18 kmol/m3) was dissolved
in 100 mL n-dodecane (≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich).
The C17–COOH solution and 0.5 g catalyst (0.5 (w/v)
%) were then added into the reactor. The hydrogen was purged a few
times to remove air from the reactor. The reactor was initially pressurized
to 20 bars hydrogen at room temperature. The reactor was heated to
a specified reaction temperature at a constant stirring speed of 1200
rpm. The reactor pressure was increased to about 31 bar at the reaction
temperature of 543 K. The initial liquid sample was taken immediately
after attainment of the specified reaction temperature. The conversion
of C17–COOH was calculated based on this initial
reaction sample. Further reaction samples were collected at different
reaction times. The products in the reaction sample were identified
by GC–MS (GCMS-QP2010 Ultra) and quantified using an off-line
GC–FID (Shimadzu, GC-2014).4 The
wt % of products and unreacted C17–COOH were calculated
based on the known concentration of internal standard, n-dodecane. The product distribution term used in the article is expressed
as wt % of the individual products.
