Sphingoid
bases, which have a 2-amino-1,3-diol common functional
group, are the structural backbone units of all sphingolipids. Recently,
much attention has been focused on sphingoid bases because of their
potentially beneficial bioactivities toward various cancer cells as
well as their dietary interest. However, low abundance and the handling
complexity caused by their amphiphilic character led to very limited
research on them. Glutaraldehyde has two aldehyde groups, and it reacts
rapidly with the 2-amino-1,3-diol functional group of sphingosine
to give a tricyclic product. Immobilization of glutaraldehyde on a
resin was successfully performed by organic synthesis, starting from trans-p-coumaric acid via eight steps.
This approach suppresses the self-polymerization of glutaraldehyde,
and addition of water to the developed resin causes the formation
of cyclic double hemiacetal function, which avoids oxidation like
a reducing sugar in nature and makes it stable even for up to 1 year
incubation. The resin was applied to the solid-phase extracting experiment
of free sphingosine from human serum at a concentration of 280 nM.
Another extraction study of edible golden oyster mushrooms showed
that the sphingoid base was selectively captured from complex natural
extracts. These results demonstrate that the developed glutaraldehyde
resin method is a highly selective method, and hence, the combination
of it with the o-phthaldialdehyde HPLC method was
confirmed as an efficient and sensitive method for analysis of sphingoid
bases in biological samples.

==== Body
Introduction
Sphingolipids are found
essentially in all animals, plants, and
fungi, as well as in some prokaryotic organisms and viruses. They
are the basic constituents of the plasma membranes, and more importantly,
they and their metabolites play crucial roles in many physiological
processes, including immune response, cell proliferation, differentiation,
and apoptosis.1−3 Sphingolipids are composed of a structurally related
family of hydrocarbon backbones having 2-amino-1,3-diol-termed sphingoid
bases. The most predominant sphingoid base found in mammalian cells
is d-erythro-sphingosine, and its cellular
levels were controlled by the action of ceramide synthase and sphingosine
kinase.4 However, because of their low
abundance as a free base in nature compared with other primary sphingolipids
and their handling complexity resulting from their amphiphilic character,
they have not been well-studied.5 In the
last few years, increasing attention has been focused on sphingoid
bases because of their potentially useful bioactivities, such as cytotoxicity
to various cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.6−9 Structurally modified sphingoid
bases have attracted more and more attention because some of their
analogues have demonstrated the capability of introducing morphological
changes in neuronal cells and behaving as enzyme inhibitors.10 Also in terms of increasing dietary interest,
applicable findings, such as improvement of diet-induced glucose intolerance
in mice by oral administration of phytosphingosine11 and activation of ceramide production in a three-dimensional
human skin model by some sphingoid bases originated from dietary konjac,
have been reported.12

Regarding chemical
synthesis of the sphingolipid family, a sphingoid
base is an essential component, which certainly improves the variety
of ceramide library by diversity-oriented acylation of its 2-amino
group,13,14 while glycosylation of its 1-hydroxyl group
leads to more complex glycosphingolipid derivatives. Recently, we
reported a highly efficient preparation method for these sphingoid
bases from naturally occurring glucosylceramides by the chemoenzymatic
method to expand the sphingolipid chemical library.15 However, handling the complexity of the sphingoid bases
is still a challenging problem to be solved. The enigmatic character
of the sphingoid bases disturbs their rapid purification; therefore,
conventional solvent extraction methods, such as Bligh–Dyer
method, Folch method, and solid-phase method,16,17 are the mostly used extraction methods. Although sphingoid bases
can be extracted by these solvent extraction methods, they have disadvantages
such as limited efficiency and low environment adaptability.

Here, we report a facile and effective solid-phase extraction method
of the sphingoid base by utilizing the reaction between a sphingoid
base and glutaraldehyde. Also, its application in sphingoid-base selective
extraction from human serum and natural resources by the glutaraldehyde-immobilized
resin is demonstrated (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Selective Solid-Phase Extraction Methodology of Sphingoid
Bases by
the Glutaraldehyde-Immobilized Merrifield Resin (GARI)
Results and Discussion
Glutaraldehyde
(1, 1,5-pentanedial) has two terminal
aldehyde functional groups and is used biochemically as an amine-reactive
homobifunctional cross-linker and a fixative. Recently, we have reported
that glutaraldehyde reacts rapidly with the 2-amino-1,3-diol of sphingosine
at ambient temperature to give a sole and stable tricyclic product
with a moderate yield without the presence of any catalyst.18 This specific protection of the amino-diol function
in sphingosine allows chiral discrimination of four sphingosine stereoisomers,
which is still a challenging work for other methods. As described
in this instance, the glutaraldehyde possesses a great advantage regarding
its reactivity toward sphingosine. However, an aldehyde function is
easily oxidized, which leads to possible aldol condensation, affording
a complex mixture of glutaraldehyde oligomers and polymers. To overcome
these two disadvantages, an immobilization strategy has been employed.
Namely, immobilization of the glutaraldehyde on the resin suppresses
its polymerization, and addition of water to this immobilized glutaraldehyde
causes the formation of cyclic double hemiacetal (1b),19 which could avoid its oxidation and likely form
a cyclic hemiacetal of a reducing sugar in nature (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Two Forms (1a, 1b) of Glutaraldehyde and
Its Reaction with d-erythro-Sphingosine
(2)
Synthesis of the glutaraldehyde resin was performed as
shown in Scheme 3.
The esterification
of the starting material, trans-p-coumaric acid,
sequential LiAlH4 reduction, and further oxidation with
2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyanobenzoquinone (DDQ) afforded trans-p-coumaric aldehyde (4) in 65% yield.20,21 After protection of the phenolic hydroxyl group with tert-butyldiphenyl silyl ether (5), a microwave-assisted
inverse-electron-demand hetero Diels-Alder reaction of ethyl vinyl
ether22 was performed in the presence of
a catalytic amount of hydroquinone to give 6 as a diastereomixture.
Deprotection of the silyl ether with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF)
produced a free alcohol 7 in 83% yield, which was immobilized
on the Merrifield resin through the SN2 reaction to afford 8 in 88% yield. The amount of reacted chloride in the Merrifield
resin was estimated by the ion chromatography method (Table S1).23,27 The structure of 8 was confirmed by comparing its IR spectrum with that of
the model compound (Figure S4).27 The following hydrolysis of 8 with
hot hydrochloric acid in dioxane successfully afforded the desired
GARI (9). Its IR spectra revealed the coexistence of
a dialdehyde form (9a) and a cyclic double hemiacetal
form (9b) (Figure S5).27 It is noteworthy that this resin is quite stable
even in the presence of a labile dialdehyde. The IR spectrum of the
resin has not changed at all even after 1 year incubation in the solid
state at room temperature (Figure S7).27 This amazing stability could be ascribed to
its cyclic double hemiacetal structure as shown in carbohydrates as
well as the immobilization effect hampering their self-condensation
reactions.

Scheme 3 Synthesis of the GARI and Its Reaction with d-erythro-Sphingosine (2)
Reagents and conditions: (a)
TBDPSCl (1.1 equiv), imidazole (1.5 equiv), DMAP (0.2 equiv), DCM,
rt, 4 h (76%); (b) ethyl vinyl ether (24 equiv), hydroquinone (0.6
equiv), n-butanol, 220 °C, microwave, 6 h (81%);
(c) TBAF (1.2 equiv), THF, rt, 3 h (83%); (d) Merrifield resin (1.1
equiv), K2CO3 (1.5 equiv), KI (0.1 equiv), DMF,
90 °C, overnight; (e) conc. HCl, dioxane, 60 °C, 4 h; (f)
THF, rt, 1.5 h; and (g) 0.25 M aq TFA, rt, 1 h; TBDPSCl = tert-butyldiphenylchlorosilane, DMAP = N,N-dimethyl-4-aminopyridine, and DCM = dichloromethane.

Conditions were optimized by changing various
organic solvents,
times, and concentrations of sphingosine during capturing experiments.
A pilot solid-phase extraction study was carried out using standard d-erythro sphingosine as shown in Scheme 3. The GARI was stirred
with sphingosine in THF for 1 h, and its capturing efficiency was
estimated as 86% via quantitative analysis of the uncaptured sphingosine
in the solution by the o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) analysis
method.24 After careful washing by appropriate
solvents, release experiments of the captured sphingosine, which is
immobilized on the resin as a tricyclic adduct, were performed by
the acid catalytic hydrolysis reaction. Optimization studies revealed
that 0.25 M aqueous (aq) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) solution gave
free sphingosine as the single product, checked as the OPA derivative
by HPLC (Table S2),27 whose structure and purity were confirmed by the direct
HPLC comparison of authentic samples through the OPA derivatization
analysis (Figure S2).27 Quantitative analysis of released OPA sphingosine showed
that the TFA catalytic releasing efficiency was 81%. The total extraction
and releasing efficiency of the resin was calculated about 70% (Figure S1).27 Also,
it is noteworthy that the recovered resin can capture a sphingoid
base at almost the same efficiency (Figure S3).27 To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first unique methodology for the rapid and efficient extraction
of free sphingoid bases, which are known as the minor components of
total lipids, by a chemoselective reaction.

The purpose of this
work is to develop a technology for the efficient
extraction of sphingoid bases. On the basis of the above strategy,
the GARI was applied to extract free sphingosine from human serum.
A phosphate derivative at 1-OH of sphingosine, which is called as
sphingosine-1-phosphate, is a bioactive lipid mediator. Its concentration
is known to be regulated by some diseases, such as atherosclerosis.
Also, its half-life time is 15 min in serum to produce a hydrolyzed
product, sphingosine. Therefore, rapid analysis of sphingosine in
human serum by the GARI would be a significant application for the
future diagnosis purposes. The effectiveness of the GARI method was
confirmed by the following study: 400 μL of methanol was added
to 100 μL of human pooled serum, and after centrifugation, the
upper layer was added to the GARI as a human serum extract. After
selective capture and acidic releasing, the released filtrate was
analyzed for free sphingosine using reversed-phase fluorescent HPLC
with the OPA derivatization technique. Comparison of the chromatogram
of the methanolic extract of human serum (Figure 1A) with the chromatogram of the elution released
from the resin (Figure 1B) clearly shows the expected selective capture of sphingosine. The
structure extracted from serum was confirmed by comparing its retention
time with that of a standard sphingosine and electrospray ionization
mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS) spectra of their OPA derivatives (Figure S2).27 The
quantitative analysis by calibration curves for authentic sphingosine
revealed that the concentration of sphingosine in human serum estimated
by the glutaraldehyde resin method was 280 nM, which is in reasonable
agreement with that of the previous report.25 These results demonstrate that the developed glutaraldehyde resin
method is a highly selective method, and hence, the combination of
it with the OPA HPLC method was confirmed as an extremely efficient
and sensitive method for the analysis of sphingoid bases in biological
samples.

serum. (A) Direct OPA derivatives of the crude methanolic extract.
(B) OPA derivatives of the methanolic extract after treatment by the
GARI. The observed sole peak eluted at 8.6 min was identified as the
OPA derivative of sphingosine (d18:14t)27 by direct comparison with its standard
sample. * denotes the relevant peaks resulting from OPA derivatization
reagents. HPLC conditions: a YMC-Pack C8 column (0.46 cm φ ×
15 cm); acetonitrile-phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 (85:15); flow rate,
1 mL/min; and a fluorescence detector, 340 nm (excitation) and 450
nm (emission).

To demonstrate the general
versatility of the GARI, a solid-phase
extraction study from a natural resource was carried out using a fungus
called the golden oyster mushroom (Pleurotus citrinopileatus). It is a significant edible mushroom found in the northern areas
of Japan and is known to contain enriched glucosylceramide.15 The methanolic extract of the fungus containing
sphingolipids was hydrolyzed to liberate free sphingoid bases using
the modified Cahoon and Lynch method.26 The HPLC chromatogram of the crude reaction mixture showed numerous
peaks (Figure 2A) as
their OPA derivatives. After treating with the resin, it showed a
few major peaks corresponding to 9-methylsphingadienine (9-Me d18:24t,8t) and glucosyl 9-methylsphingadienine
(glc-9-Me d18:24t,8t)
(hydrolyzed products of glucosylceramide) (Figure 2B) except several irrelevant peaks coming
from the OPA derivatization reagents. These peaks are produced by
the hydrolysis of a major sphingolipid component named glucosyl 9-methylsphingadienine
ceramide of fruiting bodies in the golden oyster mushroom.15 Both structures of 9-methylsphingadienine and
glucosyl 9-methylsphingadienine were confirmed by the comparison of
their retention time and their ESI-MS spectra with those of the standard
samples (Figure S2).27 The reaction of glucosyl 9-methylsphingadienine with glutaraldehyde
forming a plausible bicyclic adduct expands its capture capability.27

nm; and a fluorescence detector, 340 nm (excitation) and 450 nm (emission).

Conclusions
In summary, a unique
glutaraldehyde resin method was developed
for the first time, and it was applied to the efficient extraction
studies of endogenous sphingoid bases from human serum as well as
a golden oyster mushroom. Although, the modern sensitive MS-based
lipidomic approaches have revolutionized the study of lipids over
the past couple of decades, this method is more advantageous over
conventional solvent extraction methods in terms of chemoselectivity
for sphingoid bases, efficiency, rapidity, and versatility. This method
establishes an extraction method for rapid analysis of the nanomolar
scale of sphingoid bases with high purity. We believe that this highly
efficient extraction method of sphingoid bases from biological samples
and other natural resources is a promising technology for the discovery
of new sphingoid base chemotherapeutics.

Synthesis of Compound 8
To a stirred solution
of compound 7 (1.29 g, 5.89 mmol) in 40 mL of DMF, K2CO3 (0.814 g, 8.84 mmol, 1.5 equiv), KI (97.8 mg,
0.589 mmol, 0.10 equiv), and the Merrifield resin (1.43 g, 6.48 mmol,
1.1 equiv) were added, and the mixture was stirred at 90 °C for
30 min. It was filtrated through a sintered glass filter; the resulting
resin was washed repeatedly with water, acetone, hexane, EtOAc, and
MeOH. The structure of 8 was confirmed from its IR spectrum
by comparing it with that of the model compound 8m(17) (for the structure of 8m, see Figure S4). Agreement of important IR absorption
signals between 8 and 8m indicates their
structural similarity.

Synthesis of Compound 9
The resin 8 (1.42 g, 5.89 mmol) in 40 mL of dioxane
was swelled for
an hour at room temperature, followed by the addition of conc. HCl
(11.5 mL), and refluxed at 60 °C for 4 h. The hydrolyzed resin
was filtered and washed repeatedly with water, acetone, hexane, EtOAc,
and MeOH. The structure of 9 was confirmed by its IR
spectrum and indicates that it is a mixture of 9a and 9b. Efficiency of the immobilization reaction was calculated
to be 88% based on the elemental analysis of its chloride atom ratio
in the Merrifield resin (Table S1).

Extraction
of Spiked Standard Sphingosine by GARI
The
GARI (5 mg) was swollen in THF (200 μL) for 1 h in a 2.5 mL
Libra tube prior to its usage. To this resin suspension, 5 μL
of authentic sphingosine in methanol (1 mg/mL) was added and it was
mixed vigorously by a vortex mixer for 1.5 h at room temperature for
its capturing reaction (the IR spectrum of GARI after capturing the
reaction was shown in Figure S6). The resin
was filtered off and washed well with 200 μL of water, methanol,
and chloroform, sequentially. The resin was swollen with 200 μL
of THF for 1 h again, and then, 0.25 M TFA (200 μL) was added
for its releasing reaction. After 1 h of vortex stirring, the solution
was filtered. The filtrate was analyzed as the sphingosine OPA derivative
by the HPLC system, as described below in the extraction of sphingosine
from the human serum section.

Extraction of Free Sphingosine
from Human Serum
To
100 μL of serum, 400 μL of MeOH was added and the mixture
was centrifuged at 20 °C, 3000 rpm, for 15 min. After centrifugation,
the upper layer (350 μL) was removed and this solution was used
as a human serum extract. The GARI (5 mg) was swollen in THF (200
μL) for 1 h in a 2.5 mL Libra tube prior to its usage. To this
resin suspension, the human serum extract was added and it was mixed
vigorously by a vortex mixer for 1.5 h at room temperature for its
capturing reaction. The resin was filtered off and washed well with
200 μL of water, methanol, and chloroform, sequentially. The
resin was swollen with 200 μL of THF for 1 h again, and then,
0.25 M TFA (200 μL) was added for its releasing reaction. After
1 h of vortex stirring, the solution was filtered. The filtrate was
analyzed as the sphingosine OPA derivative by the HPLC system. The
pH of the filtrate was adjusted to around 5 with the boric acid buffer
to make sphingosine react with the OPA reagent effectively. To 50
μL of the filtrate, the same amount of freshly prepared OPA
reagent [5 mg of OPA + 100 μL ethanol + 5 μL 2-mercaptoethanol
+ 9.9 mL 3% boric acid in water (pH adjusted to 10.5 with KOH)] was
added, and the mixture was mixed vigorously by a vortex mixture for
15 min at room temperature. The mixture was added to 100 μL
of the mobile phase (85:15 acetonitrile/phosphate buffer pH 7.0);
20 μL of the resulting solution was injected to the HPLC on
a YMC-Pack C8 column (0.46 cm φ × 15 cm) using acetonitrile-phosphate
buffer pH 7.0 (85:15). The fluorescence detector was set at 340 and
450 nm as an excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. The
flow rate was 1.0 mL/min.

Extraction of Fungal Sphingoids from the
Golden Oyster Mushroom
About 1 g of the dried fruiting body
of the golden oyster mushroom
(P. citrinopileatus) was extracted
with methanol for several times. Combined methanolic extracts were
concentrated, and 20 mL of dioxane and 20 mL of 10% (w/v) Ba(OH)2 were added and refluxed at 110 °C for 24 h. After hydrolysis,
40 mL of 2% (w/v) (NH4)2SO4 was added
to precipitate barium ions. After centrifugation, the centrifugate
was extracted with diethyl ether (50 mL × 3). Combined ether
extract was concentrated, dried, and redissolved in MeOH (3 mL). Capturing
and releasing reactions of the free sphingoid base were carried out,
as described above, by adding 200 μL of the hydrolyzed mushroom
extract as a sample. OPA HPLC analyses were performed under the same
condition as described above, except that its flow rate was 0.5 mL/min.
