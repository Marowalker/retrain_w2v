This study investigated
the methane production improvement of algal
sludge by zerovalent iron (ZVI)-assisted anaerobic digestion. The
zerovalent iron added were 0.5, 2, 5, 10, and 20 g·ZVI/g·TS
(total solid). The results indicated that the addition of ZVI at 2,
5, 10, and 20 g·ZVI/g·TS has improved the methane production
1.07, 1.24, 1.41, and 1.46 times as compared with no ZVI added. The
dewaterability of treated algal sludge has improved 1.06, 1.08, 1.08,
and 1.11 times as compared with no ZVI addition. The biochemical methane
production test results fitted to both one-substrate and two-substrate
models. The one-substrate model indicated that the hydrolysis rate k has increased 8.21, 7.07, 9.39, 3.50, and 5.07 times as
compared with R1 where no ZVI was added. The two-substrate model implied
that the rapid hydrolysis rate krapid values
were 5.23, 4.5, 5.98, 2.23, and 3.23 times as compared with R1. The
one-substrate model predicted that the value of methane production
was in high correlation with the actual value (R2 > 0.98). The addition of ZVI in algal sludge for methane
production without an extra pretreatment process has improved the
hydrolysis rate and methane production. This has the potential to
be developed as an effective and economic technology in resource recovery
from algal sludge.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Algal sludge collected
from the algal bloom lakes is an important
environmental pollution problem where the treatment and resource recovery
of this waste algal sludge has aroused wide concern.1−3 Anaerobic digestion is a promising process in using algae biomass
for producing methane biogas; however, the methane production rate
is relatively low due to the low biodegradability of algae.4,5 Pretreatment technologies such as mechanical, ultrasound, microwave,
thermal, chemical, biological, and combined processes have been investigated
in improving the methane production from algae anaerobic digestion.6,7 Bai et al. reported that using free nitrous acid (2.31 mg HNO2-N·L–1) as a pretreatment process has
improved the algae methane production yield from 161 to 250 L·CH4/kg·VS added.8 Wang et al.
found that free ammonia at 60–530 mg NH3-N/L has
significantly improved the algae solubilization and the methane generation
during anaerobic digestion.5 Keymer et
al. demonstrated that a high-pressure thermal hydrolysis process has
increased the algae yield by 81%.9 Marsolek
et al. achieved an increase of biogas production from 0.28 to 0.39
L biogas per g volatile solids by thermal pretreatment at 90 °C.10 All those pretreatment processes were used to
improve the biodegradability or hydrolysis rate of the algae by disrupting
the algae cell wall.

Zhen et al. reported that zerovalent scrap
iron (ZVSI) stimulated
the anaerobic digestion of sludge with the methane yield increased
by 38.3% where the ZVSI has enhanced the methanogenesis as electron
donors and accelerated the hydrolysis–acidification and methanation
steps of the wasted activated sludge (WAS).11 It is also reported that the addition of zerovalent iron (ZVI) could
accelerate the anaerobic digestion of sludge. Feng et al. achieved
a methane production increase of 43.5% by using ZVI where the degradation
of protein and cellulose was enhanced.12 Yang et al. investigated the nano ZVI on methanogenic activity during
the anaerobic digestion, and the results indicated that ZVI at 30
mM increased methane production, while nano ZVI inhibited the methanogenic
growth and methane production at concentration of 1 mM and above.13 Suanon et al. reported that the nanoscale ZVI
and iron powder addition in sludge anaerobic digestion has enhanced
the methane yield up to 25 and 40%, respectively.14 Zhang et al. indicated that the ZVI could enhance the methanogenic
activity in the anaerobic sludge digestion.15 The total solid (TS) and total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) of
blue algae harvested from the algal bloom lakes have quite similar
values as compared with the activated sludge that was used for anaerobic
digestion. Microalgae contains a high portion of organic components
including ash (5–17%), carbohydrate (18–46%), crude
protein (18–46%), crude lipid (12–48%), and energy (19–27
MJ/kg).16 This implied that the ZVI, which
was effectively applied in enhancing the methane production from WAS
anaerobic digestion, could also be effective in the algal sludge methane
production.

This study innovatively investigated the potential
of methane production
improvement for algal sludge anaerobic digestion by the assistance
of ZVI. Biochemical methane production tests were used for accumulative
methane production analysis for the ZVI-assisted algae fermentation
under different ZVI dosages. The methane production potential and
hydrolysis rate of ZVI-assisted algal sludge digestion were analyzed
by one-substrate and two-substrate mathematical models. Economic analysis
was conducted to assess the economic potential of the proposed algae
anaerobic digestion process.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Algal Sludge and Inoculum Sludge
The algal sludge used
in this study was Microcystis sp. It was harvested
from Guanqiao Base of Institute of Hydrobiology,
Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China. Over 98% of the algal sludge
was Microcystis by the microscopic examination where
the TS was 11.28 ± 0.24 g/L and the volatile solid (VS) was 9.23
± 0.23 g/L. The inoculum sludge used was collected from the Sanjintan
wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) anaerobic fermenter, Wuhan, China.
A mesophilic anaerobic digestion process is used in the Sanjintan
WWTP for wasted sludge digestion. The characteristics of inoculum
sludge, such as TS, VS, TCOD, soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD),
and pH, were shown in Table 1.

and Seed Sludge Used in this Study

VS (g/L)	9.23 ± 0.23	12.71 ± 0.01	
TCOD (g/L)	11.28 ± 0.64	15.3 ± 0.19	
SCOD (mg/L)	323.58 ± 48.58	400.25 ± 32.75	
pH	7.19 ± 0.01	6.36 ± 0.02	
2.2 Zerovalent Iron Addition
The algal
sludge was added with ZVI at concentrations of 0, 0.5, 2, 5, 10, and
20 g·ZVI/g·TS of the algal sludge before anaerobic digestion.
The ZVI powder applied is of analytical grade with purity of 98% and
size of 0.147 mm (Kefeng Ltd., Shanghai, China). The biochemical methane
potential (BMP) tests were conducted immediately after addition of
ZVI into the algal sludge.

2.3 Biochemical Methane Potential
Test
BMP tests were conducted to assay ZVI-assisted algal
sludge anaerobic
digestion methane production. The algae and inoculum were transferred
to corresponding reactors at an initial VS ratio of 1:2. The reactor
total volume is 310 mL in which 105 mL of inoculum and 70 mL of algal
sludge were added. The ZVI powder, seed sludge, and algae were totally
mixed and flushed with pure N2 gas for 5 min where anaerobic
conditions were created. A blank test was also conducted where the
seed sludge (105 mL) and MilliQ water (70 mL) instead of the algae
were added in the reactor. The BMP test was thus started with the
reactors sealed by a rubber stopper and shaken at a 37 ± 1 °C
constant-temperature incubator. The batch tests were conducted in
triplicate in each of the incubators for 57 days until the pressure
increase in the reactors dropped to a negligible level. The pressure
in each reactor was measured, and the biogas production from the reactors
was collected every 2–4 days. The net biogas generation from
the algae in each reactor was determined by subtracting the biogas
produced by the blank reactor from each reactor. The methane production
was calculated based on the multiplication of net biogas pressure
increment in the reactor and the methane concentration produced. The
methane production was recorded as the volume of methane produced
per kg of the TS of the total algae and inoculum added in the reactor
(L·CH4/kg·TS). The accumulative methane production
was the summation of methane produced per day in the corresponding
reactor. The BMP test experimental conditions were shown in Table 2.

2.4 Mathematical Modeling Analysis
of BMP Test
Results
The hydrolysis rate (k) and biochemical
methane potential (B0) are two key parameters
associated with the methane generation. Two models including one-substrate
model and two-substrate model were used to simulate the BMP test results.
The models were as shown in eqs 1 and 2. 1   2  

As shown in eqs 1 and 2, the B(t) is the cumulative methane
production at day t (L·CH4/kg·TS, t = time (day)). Yt (L·CH4/kg·TS) is the cumulative methane production in day t by the corresponding simulated equations 1 and 2. In the one-substrate
model, B0 is the biochemical methane potential
(L·CH4/ kg·TS), and k is the
hydrolysis rate (day–1). In the two-substrate model,
the algae were considered as consisted of rapidly biodegradable components
and slowly biodegradable substrates. B0,rapid is the rapidly biodegradable substrates’ biochemical methane
potential (L·CH4/ kg·TS), krapid is the hydrolysis rate of the rapidly biodegradable substrates
(day–1), B0,slow is
the biochemical methane potential of the slowly biodegradable substrates,
and kslow is the slowly biodegradable
substrates’ hydrolysis rate (day–1). The
two-substrate model is able to give information of rapidly and slowly
biodegradable components of the ZVI-assisted algal sludge anaerobic
digestion. The changes in the parameters B0, k, B0,rapid, B0,slow, krapid,
and kslow under various ZVI concentrations
in each reactor can thus be compared.

2.5 Basic
Parameters Analysis
The basic
parameters of the inoculum and algae were tested in triplicate following
standard methods (APHA, 2016). The TCOD, SCOD, pH, NH4-N,
and fluorescence excitation emission matrix (FEEM) of the algae and
inoculum mixture were analyzed after the BMP test was stopped. FEEM
was analyzed by a fluorescence spectrometer at emission wavelengths
of 200–400 nm and excitation wavelengths at 280–540
nm (QM-4CW, PTI, USA). The dewaterability of the digested algal sludge
was tested by measuring the free-water volume of sludge after being
centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 30 min. The generated biogas pressure
was measured by a manometer before sampling, and the actual volume
was calculated from the pressure increase in the headspace volume
(135 mL) and expressed at standard atmospheric pressure (25 °C,
1 atm). The methane concentration was measured by a GC analyzer (GC7890,
Agilent, USA).

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 ZVI-Assisted Algal Sludge Methane Production
Improvement
The accumulative methane production of the reactors
with different ZVI concentrations added was shown in Figure 1. The accumulative methane
production of algae kept increasing with time and approached a stable
value at day 57. The final accumulative methane yield was 225.11,
227.36, 241.11, 279.69, 317.78, and 328.22 L·CH4/kg·TS
for ZVI addition at 0, 0.5, 2, 5, 10, and 20 g·ZVI/g·TS,
respectively. The accumulative methane yield has enhanced 1.01, 1.07,
1.24, 1.41, and 1.46 times with the addition of ZVI at 0.5, 2, 5,
10, and 20 g·ZVI/g·TS as compared with no ZVI added, respectively.
The algal sludge methane yield was rarely increased with ZVI concentration
at 0.5 g·ZVI/g·TS while kept increasing with the ZVI dosage
increased and achieved the highest value at a ZVI dosage of 20 g·ZVI/g·TS.
The ZVI dosage and the accumulative methane production value were
in linear correlation (Figure 2, R2 = 0.8524). This implied that
the addition of ZVI has enhanced the accumulative methane production
with ZVI dosage at 2 g·ZVI/g·TS and above. Zhen et al.11 reported that the ZVSI concentration at 1.0
g/g·VSS has increased the WAS methane yield by 38.3% to a value
of 174.9 mL/g·VSSfeed. The dosage used of ZVSI was
a bit lower than the ZVI used in this study, which indicated that
the algal sludge was more recalcitrant as compared with the WAS. The
biogas generated in this study was much higher than the WAS as reported
by earlier work, which indicated higher methane production potential
of the algae.11−13,17 The ZVI added could
have improved the algae solubilization during the fermentation process
and thus improved biodegradability of the algae.1,8 The
existence of ZVI powder also could provide physical effects in improving
the algae cell disruption during the shaking process.14,18 The iron ions also could be reacted as an electron donor and change
the pH in the reactor, thus causing the algae cell disintegration.11 Based on which, the algal sludge fermentation
process was accelerated with the existence of ZVI, and the accumulated
methane production was also improved.

the concentration of ZVI added and the corresponding

3.2 Biochemical Methane Potential Analysis
To understand the effect of ZVI addition in the enhancement of methane
production for algal sludge, both one-substrate model and two-substrate
model were used to simulate the methane production. Both one-substrate
model and two-substrate model were fitted well with the methane production
results in this study (Table 3, R2 > 0.96 and Table 4, R2 > 0.96). The predicted biochemical methane production by the
one-substrate
model and the actual methane production value during the BMP test
were in linear correlation (Figure 3, R2 > 0.98). As shown
in Table 3, results
of the one-substrate model shows that the hydrolysis rate k values of the algal sludge were 0.0028, 0.023, 0.0198,
0.0263, 0.0098, and 0.0142 day–1 for reactors with
ZVI dosage at 0, 0.5, 2, 5, 10, and 20 g·ZVI/g·TS added.
The hydrolysis rate of the reactors with ZVI added has improved 8.21,
7.07, 9.39, 3.50, and 5.07 times as compared with the control reactor
where no ZVI was added. The k value is much lower
than the earlier reported work of WAS, while the k value enhanced with the addition of ZVI was much higher.19−21 This implied that the ZVI has largely improved the hydrolysis rate
of algae, not only promoted the algae cell disruption but also improved
the hydrolyzed organic components’ biodegradability.11,18 This implied that with the existence of ZVI in the reactor, the
hydrolysis rate of algae anaerobic digestion was improved. The predicted
biochemical methane production by the one-substrate model was 247.50,
239.19, 257.42, 289.50, 338.19, and 344.48 L·CH4/kg·TS
in reactors R1 to R6, respectively. It is also shown in Table 3 that the pure algae without
ZVI added has an extremely high B0 and
a low k value. This implied that the pure algae have
a high methane potential but a low hydrolysis rate, which means that
the methane production from pure algae might need a very long period
and assistance methods are necessary.

potential by the one-substrate
model (R2 > 0.98).

The two-substrate model results
show that the rapid hydrolysis
rate krapid values for R1 to R6 were 0.0044,
0.023, 0.0198, 0.0263, 0.098, and 0.0142 day–1 (Table 4). The rapid hydrolysis
rates for algal sludge with ZVI added at R2 to R6 were 5.23, 4.50,
5.98, 2.23, and 3.23 times as compared with the pure algae. The corresponding
rapid biochemical methane potential B0,rapid values were 160.3, 189.21, 180.28, 395.25, and 308.72 for R2 to
R6. All the reactors with ZVI added show higher rapid hydrolysis rates
where higher ZVI dosage results in a higher B0,rapid. The rapid hydrolysis rate for pure algae was quite
low, and the B0,rapid was quite high.
This was similar with the one-substrate model results. The slow hydrolysis
rate kslow for pure algae was quite high
with a value of 1914.85 day–1, and the slow biochemical
methane potential B0,slow has a negative
value. This could summarize that the methane production rate for pure
algae was much lower than that of the ZVI-assisted algae anaerobic
digestion. The kslow for R2 to R6 were
0.023, 0.020, 0.026, 0.010, and 0.014 day–1. The B0,slow for R2 to R6 were 167.16, 191.30, 192.46,
394.92, and 312.11 L·CH4/kg·TS. The B0,slow of reactors with higher ZVI added has a lower value
as compared with R2 where ZVI was added at 0.5 g·ZVI/g·TS.
This summarized that both rapidly and slowly biodegradable components
were improved with the assistance of ZVI addition.22,23

3.3 Characteristics of the Digested Algal Sludge
The TCOD and SCOD of the digested algal sludge were shown in Figure 4. The SCOD/ TCOD
values of the digested algal sludge were 0.02, 0.03, 0.21, 0.35, 0.26,
and 0.24 for ZVI added at 0, 0.5, 2, 5, 10, and 20 g·ZVI/g·TS.
The highest TCOD was shown in the pure algae reactor R1. The results
indicated that the reactors with ZVI added above 0.5 g·ZVI/ g·TS
has a much higher SCOD/TCOD even for the digested sludge. The ZVI
added at 0.5 g·ZVI/g·TS only slightly improved the SCOD/TCOD
value, while the TCOD was also lower than the pure algae reactor.
This implied that the ZVI addition has improved the biodegradability
of the algal sludge and thus improved the methane production rate;
this was in accordance with the BMP test results. It is also obvious
that a high SCOD of around 3000 mg/L was retained in R3 to R6 for
the digested algal sludge. The BMP test was stopped when the pressure
in the reactor stopped increasing in this study. The SCOD value of
R3 to R6 implied that the algal sludge still has potential to generate
more methane gas.24,25 This also can be seen from the
FEEM results shown in Figure 5. There were still fluorescence-responsible organic components
in R4 to R6 even though the intensity is much lower than initial activated
sludge.26 This once again could conclude
that ZVI addition has enhanced the SCOD release from the algae, improved
the biodegradability of the algae, and results in improvement of methane
production in the same period as compared with the pure algae.

R5 - 10 g·ZVI/ g·TS, and (f) R6 - 20 g·ZVI/g·TS.

3.4 Dewaterability and Economics
of the Treated
Algal Sludge
The algal sludge has similar characteristics
with wasted activated sludge and also shares the same problem of dewaterability,
which finally affects the treatment costs. The dewaterability of the
digested algal sludge was as shown in Figure 6. The reactors with ZVI added at 2 to 20
g·ZVI/g·TS have much higher dewaterability as compared with
R1 and R2 where ZVI added were 0 and 0.5 g·ZVI/g·TS. This
could conclude that the addition of ZVI also enhanced the dewaterability
of the algal sludge. The ZVI could have promoted the algae cell disintegration
and the release of free water, and this improved the digested algae
biodegradability and dewaterability. The particle size of algal sludge
also could be decreased with ZVI or iron ions as a conditioner and
thus facilitated the filtration process and improved the dewaterability.27

Figure 6 . Dewaterability of the algal sludge after ZVI-assisted
digestion
stopped.

The economic analysis of the ZVI-assisted
algal sludge, ZVI+hydrogen
peroxide, and conventional Fenton conditioning methods for sludge
dewaterability improvement were conducted and compared by a desktop
scaling-up study. In the economic analysis, the improvement in algal
sludge dewaterability was assumed to be same for the three conditioning
methods. As shown in Table 5, the ZVI-assisted process without pretreatment compared with
other conditioning processes has saved up to 74.72% ($50,181) for
the digested algal sludge treatment. The dry sludge amount in the
economic analysis in Table 5 cited from Zhou et al.27 was information
from a wastewater treatment plant with population equivalent to 300,000.
Thus, the cost saved for digested algal sludge was not counted as
money saved per year but per ton. The algal sludge dewaterability
enhancement with ZVI only assistance could save $21.44/ton algae to
be treated. This preliminary lab experiment results in this study
indicated that the ZVI-assisted algae digestion process has the potential
to deliver substantial savings in the industrial area. However, further
investigation, especially for full-scale application, requires future
verification of the results.

3.5 Perspectives
of Algal Sludge Resource Recovery
The algal sludge collected
from the algal bloom lakes has been
an environmental problem for decades, and the algae biomass resource
recovery is an important issue. This study indicated that adding ZVI
at a dosage of 2 g·ZVI/g·TS and above could enhance the
methane production from algal sludge, enhance the digested algal sludge
dewaterability, and save cost. This study added ZVI directly into
the fresh algae and started the anaerobic digestion without a complicated
pretreatment process. This is also more convenient and energy-saving
as compared with other studies, which used complicated pretreatment
before the anaerobic digestion process.19,28,29 It is also reported that the ZVI was used for soil
or groundwater remediation;30,31 thus, the environmental
risk of reuse of the digestate with ZVI from this study could be ignored.
This makes the ZVI-assisted algal sludge digestion more attractive
for future industrial application. At the meantime, the ZVI recovery
and reuse or ZVI-based materials to be integrated into an anaerobic
digester should be further investigated.

4 Conclusions
This study investigated the methane production potential of algal
sludge by the assistance of zerovalent iron addition. The results
indicated that the addition of ZVI has improved the methane production
and the dewaterability of the digested algal sludge. The addition
of ZVI at 2, 5, 10, and 20 g·ZVI/g·TS has improved the methane
production 1.07, 1.24, 1.41, and 1.46 times as compared with no ZVI
addition. Both one-substrate model and two-substrate model fitted
well with the biochemical methane potential test results. The addition
of ZVI has enhanced the hydrolysis rate 3.5 to 9.39 times as model
results of the one-substrate model and improved the rapid hydrolysis
rate 2.23 to 5.98 times in the two-substrate model as compared with
pure algae anaerobic digestion. The economic analysis results implied
that the algal sludge dewatering has saved 74.72% of cost by using
ZVI as compared with the conventional process in activated sludge
treatment. The ZVI addition has the potential to be developed as an
effective and economically friendly technology for algae resource
recovery.
