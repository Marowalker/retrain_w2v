We report the duplex amplification of two plasmid DNA
markers involved
in the virulence of Bacillus anthracis, CAP and PAG, and the direct electrochemical detection of these
amplicons. The method consists of the simultaneous amplification of
the two targets in a single-pot reaction via polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) using tailed primers and ferrocene-labeled dATP. Following amplification,
the PCR products hybridize to probes immobilized on electrodes in
a microfabricated electrode array chip. The incorporated ferrocene
labeled dATP is then detected using square wave voltammetry. We evaluated
the effect of electrolyte cations, anions, and concentration to condense,
bend, and shrink double-stranded DNA and their effect on the intensity
of the ferrocene signal. We obtained detection limits of 0.8 and 3.4
fM for CAP and PAG targets, respectively. We successfully developed
a method to detect the presence of both targets in genomic DNA extracted
from real samples.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Bacillus
anthracis is a nonmotile,
Gram-positive, rod-shaped, and spore-forming bacteria, known for being
the causative agent of Anthrax.1 It is
an enzootic disease in most countries in Africa and Asia, but it also
occurs sporadically in Europe, America, and Australia. Anthrax affects
mainly herbivores but all mammals, including humans susceptible to
infection. The infection starts when spores of B. anthracis enter the host body through skin injuries, an insect bite, by consuming
contaminated food, and/or by inhalation of airborne spores. Generally,
gastrointestinal and pulmonary infections are more severe, but even
cutaneous infection, the most common form of infection in humans,
can lead to fatal systemic anthrax.2 The
World Health Organization has published an extensive review on anthrax
covering different aspects of the disease, including the disease and
its importance, the etiology and ecology, the incidence, the transmission,
the clinical manifestations, the treatment and prophylaxis in humans
and animals, and directions for Anthrax control and surveillance.1

There are several reports describing methods
for the detection
of B. anthracis,3 and those based on the detection of nucleic acids are very
interesting because of the higher sensitivity and specificity that
can be achieved as compared to antigen–antibody/aptamer-based
detection systems. Most of the reports focus on the detection of two
virulence plasmids, pXO1 and pXO2, which have been used to distinguish
them from other bacteria in the Bacillus cereus group, such as B. anthracis, B. cereus, Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus mycoides, Bacillus Psuedomycoides, and Bacillus
wihenstephanensis.3 The
pXO1 plasmid contains the genes for the toxin proteins: protective
antigen [pagA], edema factor [cya], and lethal factor [lef], which
work in tandem to produce edema and cell death. On the other hand,
the pXO2 bears the genes capA, capB, and capC required for the capsule
synthesis that facilitates evasion of the immune system. The number
of pXO1 and pXO2 plasmid copies differs from strain to strain and
are between 2 and 41 copies of pXO1 plasmid and 1–2 copies
of pXO2 plasmid.4

The loss of any
of the plasmids, which is common for pXO2 plasmid
in nature but rare for the toxin plasmid pXO1, results in a strong
strain attenuation.2 In fact, vaccines
for B. anthracis are made of strains
that do not contain pXO1 plasmid (Pasteur vaccine) or strains that
do not contain pXO2 plasmid (Sterne vaccine) because the absence of
one of them highly decreases its virulence. Consequently, when developing
a method to identify B. anthracis and
assess its risks and potential effect on health, it is important not
only to identify the species but also to determine if it contains
both virulent plasmids.

Determination of pXO1 and pXO2 plasmids
is reported for quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) setups because of its high sensitivity
and the self-contained nature of the assay. Nevertheless, qPCR requires
expensive and bulky instrumentation that hinders its applicability
as a point-of-need method. As an alternative, electrochemical genosensors
are emerging as an alternative approach to qPCR with advantages that
include portability, low cost, and good analytical performance.5

Electrochemical genosensors combine the
high sensitivity and robustness
of electrochemistry-based sensors6 with
the selectivity provided by the specific DNA hybridization that occurs
between complementary DNA strands. In most cases, genosensors require
an initial enrichment of the target sequence to increase the target
concentration to detectable levels, a step that is usually performed
using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).7 Following amplification, the majority of electrochemical genosensors
require the generation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) from the PCR
product for detection via hybridization to a specifically designed
and immobilized capture oligonucleotide probe. Generation of ssDNA
can be achieved using asymmetric PCR, where different ratios of primers
are exploited,7 or alternatively, via thermal
denaturation and rapid cooling.7 An attractive
alternative is the selective enzymatic digestion of one of the DNA
strands using, for example, T7 or lambda exonuclease and a phosphorothioate
labeled forward primer, while another approach uses biotinylated primer,
following the capture of the amplicon on streptavidin magnetic beads
and thermal/pH denaturation to release ssDNA.8 A different strategy reported recently takes advantage of the use
of tailed primers, which consist of primers modified at the 5′-
end with a single-stranded DNA sequence (“tail”) that
is used for hybridization. The tail is separated from the primer using
a 3-C alkyl chain spacer to prevent the elongation of the tail during
amplification.9−13

The detection of DNA following hybridization to the immobilized
oligonucleotide probe can be achieved directly by direct oxidation
of guanines,14 but the majority of the
reports to date describe the use of labels (organic dyes, metal complexes,
enzymes, or metal particles) that bind to the target through a secondary
labeled reporting probe or, alternatively, intercalate within the
dsDNA, or are electrostatically adsorbed on the dsDNA backbone.15

The use of dNTPs modified with redox active
labels presents a very
interesting approach to directly produce a labeled amplicon and avoid
the necessity of introducing a secondary labeled probe. Several redox
labeled dNTPs have been reported including ferrocene,16 anthraquinone,17 benzofurazane,18 and polyoxometalates.19 Ferrocene is particularly of interest because it is a reversible
and stable label with redox peaks within the potential window of a
gold electrode, and furthermore, Fc-labeled dNTPs are efficiently
incorporated by several DNA polymerases such as Klenow (exo-), DyNAzyme,16 and Vent (exo-).20 We have chosen 7-ferrocenyl-ethynyl-7-deaza-dATP (dAEFcTP) because it was previously
shown that 7-alkynyl-7-deazaadeninen are particularly good substrates
for polymerases, even better than natural dATP.21

We recently reported a singleplex genosensor to determine
the presence
of Karlodinium armiger in seawater
samples as a proof-of-concept of a novel approach, where we combined
the use of tailed primers and dAEFcTP.22 This feasibility
study highlighted the possibility of using this approach for detection
of a single DNA sequence. In the work reported here, we wished to
further show the immense possibilities of the approach by moving forward
to a more challenging target that requires duplex parallel detection
of two sequences. Duplex detection with two sets of tailed primers
requires optimization to facilitate a single-pot amplification with
duplex-target detection as opposed to two individual PCR reactions
being detected on a single microarray. Probes designed to hybridize
to the tails of each of the targets were immobilized on individual
electrodes of a microarray and were evaluated for their specificity.
Furthermore, we studied the effect of the electrolyte solution on
the ferrocene oxidation peak because of shrinking, bending, and shielding
effects, evaluating the effect of monovalent (K+ and Na+) and divalent (Mg2+, Sr2+, and Ca2+) cations and the effect of a range of anions and the effect
of the electrolyte concentration and pH. Using conditions optimized
to provide maximum specificity and sensitivity, the genosensor array
was exploited for the detection of the B. anthracis virulence factors CAP and PAG genes in real samples, and the flow-through
assay is schematically depicted in Figure 1.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 PCR Product Hybridization and Cross Reactivity
To demonstrate the method presented in this paper, we carried out
five different PCR reactions to produce: #1. CAP-Fc, #2. CAP, #3.
PAG-Fc, #4. PAG, and #5. CAP-Fc + PAG-Fc, where CAP or PAG refers
to amplicon containing the CAP or PAG target sequence, respectively,
and Fc indicates the presence of dAEFcTP in the PCR mixture.

As we previously
reported, the ratio dAEFcTP/dATP affects the PCR amplification yield and the electrochemical
signal obtained.22 For most of the applications
where the target concentration is in the range of fM, the ratio should
be below 40% to amplify the target to detectable levels. We performed
all the experiments with 20% dAEFcTP/dATP ratio as it allowed us to amplify both targets
at the same time and obtain good electrochemical signals.

As
can be seen in Figure 2a, gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that the duplex PCR
product with the dAEFcTP incorporated produces two distinguishable bands, with band intensities
similar to the singleplex amplification of each of CAP and PAG with dAEFcTP. The difference
in band intensities between both the CAP and PAG, with and without
the dAEFcTP, is
probably caused by the presence of bulky ferrocene moiety in the template
which can lower the PCR yield because of the difficult reading of
the polymerase through the hypermodified DNA strand.23

array. (A) Agarose gel electrophoresis obtained after PCR amplification.
(B) Voltammogram obtained for hybridization of PCR product #3 on the
electrode array. (C) Peak intensites obtained for the other PCR products.

Subsequently, we added each of the PCR products
(#1–5) to
a different electrode array and then allowed them to incubate for
30 min at room temperature (22 °C), washed the arrays with PBS
Tween, and detected the presence of ferrocene using square wave voltammetry
in the presence of 100 mM Ca(NO3)2. Figure 2b shows an example
of the voltammograms obtained for array number 3. The voltammograms
obtained for the other electrode arrays can be seen in Supporting Information (Figure S1). Only the
electrodes modified with the capture probe for the PAG target showed
a ferrocene oxidation peak at 360 mV when incubated with the PCR product
#3. There was no ferrocene oxidation peak observed for the electrodes
modified with the capture probe for the CAP target, indicating that
there is no nonspecific adsorption on the electrodes or cross-reactivity
between the tails. Figure 2c shows the ferrocene peak currents obtained for the rest
of the PCR products when incubated, washed, and measured with the
electrode array. As expected, only the PCR products containing ferrocene
give an oxidation peak, and the peak is only observed for the electrodes
modified with the specific capture probe. We observed that the ferrocene
peak obtained for PAG is higher than the ferrocene peak obtained for
CAP, even if the starting DNA concentration for both targets in the
PCR mixture is the same. We attribute this difference to the different
content of adenosine in the target sequences (PAG has 45 and CAP 36).
Brázdilova et al.16 previously reported
the peak intensity dependence on the number of dAEFcTP incorporated in the DNA. Additionally,
we also observed no significant differences between the singleplex
product and the duplex product for each of the targets, which suggests
that neither of the targets supress or inhibit the amplification of
the other target.

2.2 Effect of Electrolyte on the Ferrocene Oxidation
Peak
We studied the effect of the electrolyte solution on
the ferrocene oxidation peak. We assessed the effect of the cation,
the effect of the anion, and the effect of the electrolyte concentration
in the pH range between 6 and 7.4 and at a constant temperature of
25 °C (Figure 3). We could not observe the ferrocene oxidation peak in the presence
of PBS and other electrolytes containing monovalent cations such as
K+ and Na+. We hypothesize that the ferrocenes
could not reach the electrode surface to allow the electron transfer
because of the two main factors: (a) the poor mobility of the ferrocene
confined in the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) structure and (b) the
repulsion experienced by captured PCR amplicons hybridized to the
electrode-tethered probes, with neighboring PCR amplicons and the
ssDNA capture probes immobilized on the electrode surface.

Figure 3 Effect of cations,
anions, and electrolyte concentration on intensity
of the ferrocene signal.

However, we clearly observed the ferrocene oxidation
peak in the
presence of the divalent cations: Ca2+, Mg2+, and Sr2+. We postulate that this is due to the ability
of divalent cations to: (a) condense and shrink dsDNA,24 (b) bend dsDNA,25 and (c) shield the electrostatic repulsions between neighboring
DNA strands,26 with the combination of
these effects contributing to bringing the ferrocenes closer to the
electrode surface, facilitating electron transfer.

We also observed
a decrease in the ferrocene peak intensity when
we decreased the concentration of the electrolyte Ca(NO3)2 from 0.1 to 0.001 M, which we attribute to less cation
molecules being available at lower electrolyte concentrations, and
less notable shrinking, bending, and shielding effect thus occurs.

Finally, we observed that the ferrocene peak intensity also depends
on the nature of the anion present in the solution we tested: NO3–, acetate–, SO42–, and Cl–. This phenomenon
is more difficult to explain because anions are rarely considered
in the first hydration shell of the DNA because of the negatively
charged nature of the DNA phosphate backbone which repels anions and
attracts cations. However, there are studies that demonstrate that
DNA has electropositive edges which involve amino, imino, and hydroxyl
groups that can act as binding points for anions.27

We chose Ca(NO3)2 0.1 M as
the preferred
electrolyte solution to perform further experiments, but Mg(NO3)2 0.1 M or Sr(NO3)2 0.1
M could also be used, and the same results are obtained.

2.3 Duplex Calibration Curve and Real Samples
We performed a PCR duplex calibration curve covering a wide range
of starting DNA concentrations, from 100 aM to 10 pM using a 20% dAEFcTP/dATP ratio. We
observed that the ferrocene signal is saturated for both CAP and PAG
targets at concentrations between 100 fM and 10 pM, and that no signal
is observed for concentrations equal to or below 100 aM. We used GraphPad
Prism software to plot the peak current versus initial target concentration
and applied a sigmoidal curve fit. The limit of detection (LOD) was
calculated as the blank value plus three times the standard deviation
of the blank value. We obtained detection limits of 0.8 and 3.4 fM
for CAP and PAG targets, respectively (Figure 4). A higher number of PCR cycles could be
used to decrease the LOD, but this also results in nonspecific amplicons
bearing the tail, that will be detected as false positives.

Figure 4 Duplex calibration
curve performed with synthetic DNA and genomic
samples.

The same PCR conditions were used to determine
the presence of
CAP and PAG targets in 4 genomic DNA extracts from real samples: S1,
S2, S3, and S4. We only observed ferrocene peaks for CAP and/or PAG
for the samples, where we expected to find the targets, according
to the data provided by FLI and the qPCR experiment carried out in
house (Table 1).

In order to identify the presence of B. anthracis and its virulence, we chose to detect
the pag and cap genes present
in the virulence plasmids pXO1 and pXO2, respectively. The bases are
similar to commercial kits that are based on the target amplification
of virulence plasmid markers cya, lef of pag for pXO1, and cap for
pXO2, where the main differences rely on the detection strategy of
the amplification product. While we used ferrocene-labeled dATP to
generate redox active amplicons that we detected following hybridization
to specifically designed probes immobilized on individual gold electrodes
of an array, the commercial kits are based on detection of the amplicon
using fluorescent probes. Examples of commercially available kits
include: Applied Biosystems TaqMan B. anthracis Detection Kit, based on a dual singleplex assay for pXO1 and pXO2,
AmpliSens B. anthracis-FRT based on
the triplex detection of pagA, capA genes, and an internal control,
and RealArt B. anthracis PCR from Arthus
Biotech, based on the detection of lef and capA targets.

Apart
from the commercially available kits there are many reports
describing nucleic-based methods to detect B. anthracis.3 The majority of these are based on
the detection of the mentioned virulent plasmid markers, but there
are other nonplasmid targets described in the literature, including
the chromosomal markers BA-5449,28 BA-5510,29 gyrA,30 rpoB31 pIcR,32 and AC-39033 and variable number tandem repeats present in
an open reading frame.34 While these markers
are useful for the identification of B. anthracis, they cannot be used to predict the virulence of the strain, as
this is dependent on the presence of the virulence plasmids pXO1 and
pXO2.

An electrochemical genosensor to detect the specific B. anthracis regulatory gene atxA was recently reported,35 based on the post-asymmetric amplification and
hybridization of the target, with differential pulse voltammetric
detection of the redox intercalator methylene blue. The LOD is higher
than the one presented in this paper (1 pM vs 1 fM), and the amplification
time is longer (132 vs 90 min), and while the method was useful for
the identification of B. anthracis,
it did not determine the presence of pXO1 and pXO2 and thus could
not predict its virulence.

Another recent approach consisted
of the isothermal real time recombinase
polymerase amplification of four different markers, the BA-5345 chromosomal
marker, lef factor (pXO1), capA (pxO2), and adk marker from the B. cereus group. The method has been used and validated
in field achieving an LOD of 10 copies in less than 10 min but requires
four singleplex reactions, instead of a single one-pot multiplex reaction.36

Our approach is significantly more facile
than many of these reported
approaches, being able to simultaneously but individually and quantitatively
detect each of the pXO1 and pXO2, at low femtomolar detection limits
using duplex amplification and detection. The use of the tailed primers
overcomes the need for the generation of ssDNA, which is not only
laborious and costly but also significant, and uncontrollable amounts
of DNA are often lost while producing the ssDNA. The use of the Fc-dATP
facilitates direct electrochemical detection of the tailed amplicon
product, significantly simplifying the assay, and we are currently
working on the use of isothermal amplification to further move this
approach toward an effective platform, which can be deployed and used
at the point-of-need/care.

3 Conclusions
We presented a novel duplex
electrochemical genosensor for the
simultaneous amplification and detection of 2 DNA sequences, that
is, two plasmid DNA markers involved in the virulence of B. anthracis, CAP and PAG, in genomic DNA extracted
from real samples. The main advantages of the method include the amplification
of both targets in a single-pot reaction and the direct hybridization
and detection of the PCR product on an electrode microarray. The method
overcomes some of the limitations of classic genosensors, including
the need to generate ssDNA for hybridization purposes, thanks to the
use of tailed primers and the need for posthybridization labeling
methods because of the use of ferrocene-labeled dATP, the combination
of both decreasing the number of steps required. We also studied the
effect of electrolyte cations, anions, and concentration on the ferrocene
signal and postulated that the enhancement in the signal observed
in the presence of divalent cations is because of their ability to
condense, bend, and shrink double-stranded DNA, while shielding the
electrostatic repulsions between neighboring DNA strands and culminating
in the ferrocenes being closer to the electrode surface, thus enhancing
electron transfer. The method presented here is completely generic
in nature and transferable to other targets for duplex or multiplex
simultaneous detection of several DNA targets. In order to implement
the use of tailed primers and dAEFcTP for use at the point-of-need, we are currently
exploring multiplex isothermal amplification combined with electrochemical
detection using a handheld potentiostat.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Reagents and Materials
For PCR experiments,
we used KOD XL polymerase purchased from Merck Millipore (Madrid,
Spain), synthetic oligonucleotides obtained from Biomers (Ulm, Germany),
natural dNTPs from ThermoFischer Scientific (Barcelona, Spain), and dAEFcTP synthesized following
the Sonogashira reaction.16 For qPCR experiments,
we used the PowerUp SYBRGreen master mix from Applied Biosystems.

For agarose gel electrophoresis, we employed certified molecular
biology agarose gel powder from ThemoFischer Scientific (Barcelona,
Spain), GelRed Nucleic Acid Gel Stain from Biotium (Barcelona, Spain),
Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer prepared in house (10.8 g of TRIS-base,
5.5 g of boric acid, and 4 mL of ETDA 0.5 M per liter of solution),
and the DNA gene ruler low range DNA Ladder from Thermo Scientific.

To fabricate the electrode array and microfluidics, we used soda-lime
glass slides from Sigma-Aldrich (Spain), three-millimeter thick polymethylmethacrylate
(PMMA) from La Indústria de la Goma (Tarragona, Spain), and
double-sided adhesive gasket ARSeal 90880 from Adhesive Research (Ireland).

All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich S.A. (Barcelona,
Spain) and used as received.

We used DNA free water provided
by Fisher Bioreagents to prepare
PCR solutions and high purity deionized water (18 MΩ) produced
with a Milli-Q RG system (Millipore Ibérica, Spain) for all
other solutions.

4.2 Oligonucleotide Sequences
We modified
the previously published primers for the detection of CAP and PAG
genes37,38 by the addition of two different tails on
the forward primers: CAP FwP and PAG FwP. The specificity of these
primers was checked using Primer Blast software. In addition, the
multiple primer analyzer from ThermoFischer Scientific was used to
test the cross-reactivity between the different primers designed,
so that the designed primers avoid the formation of self-dimers and
primer-dimers. Table 2 details the oligonucleotides and modifications used in this work.

4.3 Real Samples
The Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut
(FLI) kindly provided us with purified genomic DNA samples, positive
for B. anthracis, following the protocol
described in the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit from Qiagen. Table 1 shows the presence of the plasmid
pXO1, and/or the plasmid pXO2 for each of the samples according to
the FLI Institute, to the qPCR experiments, and to the method presented
here.

4.4 Polymerase Chain Reaction
We performed
PCR in a T100 thermal cycler (Biorad) following the next step cycling
protocol: 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 34 cycles at 95 °C
for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s, with a final
elongation step at 72 °C for 5 min. Each 10 μL reaction
mixture had 0.1 units of KOD XL, KOD XL buffer 1X, CAP primers (CAP
FwP and CAP RvP) at 100 nM each one, PAG primers (PAG FwP and PAG
RvP) at 100 nM each one, dGTP, dCTP, dTTP at 200 μM, and dATP
at 160 μM and dAEFcTP at 40 μM and finally 1 μL of the sample (Table 3).

4.5 Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
We visualized
the PCR products using agarose gel electrophoresis. The gel was prepared
with ultralow pure agarose (4% w/v) in 1× TBE buffer and stained
with GelRednucleic acid stain. We loaded 3 μL of the PCR product
with 3 μL of loading buffer 2× per well, performed electrophoresis
at 100 V for 1 h, and imaged the gels in a UV transilluminator at
λ = 254 nm.

4.6 Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction
We performed qPCR assay using a real time thermocycler 7900HT from
Applied Biosystems and a two-step cycling protocol with an initial
denaturation step at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles
at 95 °C for 20 s and 60 °C for 30 s. The reaction mixture
contained SYBR Green dye 1×, CAP primers (CAP FwP and CAP RvP)
at 100 nM each one, 100 nM of each of the PAG primers (PAG FwP and
PAG RvP), and different concentrations of the target DNA or the sample
diluted in the qPCR mixture 10 times. The amplification plots for
CAP and PAG targets and genomic DNA samples are included in the Supporting Information (Figures S1 and S2).

4.7 Electrode Fabrication
We designed
an electrode array with a set of six circular gold working electrodes
(1 mm2) and a rectangular gold counter electrode (8 mm2), Figure 5. To fabricate the array, we used soda-lime glass slides as the substrate,
and we deposited the 30 nm Ti layer and the 100 nm Au layer by sputtering,
as described previously.39 Briefly, we
deposited a positive photoresist AZ1505 (MicroChemicals GmbH, Germany)
via spin coating at 4000 rpm for 30 s on a precleaned and dried glass
slide. We then placed and aligned a chromium mask in the contact mode
on the photoresist coated glass slide, which was subsequently exposed
to UV light for 4 s (LED Paffrath GmbH, Rose FotoMasken, Germany),
and the photoresist was developed using the commercial developer AZ726.
We then introduced the glass slide into the sputtering chamber (ATC
Orion 8-HV, AJA Interna-tional Inc., USA) for oxygen plasma etching
using AC O2/Ar (5 cm3·s–1 of Ar, 5 cm3·s–1 of O2, 50 W) for 5 min, using a sputtering deposition of the 30 nm Ti/TiO2 layer (oxygen flow rate: 5 cm3·s–1 of O2 for the first 10 nm, which was then increased to
20 cm3·s–1 for the last 20 nm. Ar
flow rate: constant 5 cm3·s–1) and
a sputtering deposition on the 100 nm Au layer by AC sputtering (5
cm3·s–1 of Ar, 5 cm3·s–1 of O2, 50 W). Finally, we performed the
lift-off step by sonication in acetone for 5 min, then sonication
in isopropanol for 5 min, and finally, we rinsed the glass slide with
Milli-Q water and dried with N2.

Figure 5 Scheme of the electrode
array and the microfluidic cell.

4.8 Electrode Functionalization with Capture Probe
Prior to functionalization, we washed the electrode arrays with
soap, then rinsed them with Milli-Q water, and finally dried them
with N2. We then dropcasted 1 μL of a surface probe
cocktail on each working electrode, and the array was then incubated
overnight (at least 16 h) at room temperature (22 °C) in a humidity
saturated chamber. The probe cocktail contained 1 μM capture
probe (CAP capture or PAG capture), 100 μM mercaptohexanol,
and 1 M KH2PO4. After functionalization, we
rinsed the electrodes with abundant Milli-Q and dried them with N2.

4.9 Microfluidic Fabrication and Mounting
We designed microfluidic chambers of 15 μL volume to host the
PCR product for amplicon hybridization and electrochemical detection
(Figure 5). The chamber
is achieved by adhering the electrode array to a PMMA cover using
a double adhesive gasket. We used Winrad software to design the patterns
and a CO2 laser marker (Fenix, Synrad, USA) to cut the
materials. Once assembled, we washed the microfluidic chambers with
200 μL of PBS Tween-20, then 200 μL of Milli-Q and finally
dried them with N2 prior to use.

4.10 Amplicon Hybridization on Electrode Arrays
After PCR, we injected 15 μL of the PCR product into the
microfluidic chamber housing the electrode array. Hybridization took
place at room temperature (22 °C) in a humidity saturated chamber
for 30 min. We then flushed the microfluidic chamber 3 times, with
200 μL of PBS Tween-20 and then with 200 μL of Mg(NO3)2 0.1 M.

4.11 Electrochemical Measurements
We
performed square wave voltammetry using a potentiostat/galvanostat
PBSTAT 12 Autolab controlled with Nova 2.1.3 software. We took the
measurements following hybridization in a Mg(NO3)2 0.1 M electrolyte solution using an external Ag/AgCl reference electrode
and the internal counter and working gold electrodes on the electrode
array. We stepped the potential from 0 to 0.6 V with a 5 mV step,
25 mV modulation amplitude and 50 Hz of frequency. The potentiostat
and electrode array were connected using an “in-house”
connector.
