Synthetic DNA-binding
inhibitors capable of gaining precise control
over neurogenesis factors could obviate the current clinical barriers
associated with the use of small molecules in regenerative medicine.
Here, we report the design and bioefficacy of the synthetic ligand
PIP-RBPJ-1, which caused promoter-specific suppression of neurogenesis-associated
HES1 and its downstream genes. Furthermore, PIP-RBPJ-1 alone altered
the neural-system-associated Notch-signaling factors and remarkably
induced neurogenesis with an efficiency that was comparable to that
of a conventional approach.

Introduction
Multipotent neural
stem cells (NSCs) are responsible for neurogenesis
and plasticity in regions of the mammalian adult brain.1,2 In neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington’s and Alzheimer’s
disease, neurogenesis (which involves the precise orchestration of
diverse bioactive factors and intricate receptor signaling) is perturbed.1,3 Alterations in the complex transcription machinery of NSCs that
depend on extrinsic and intrinsic factors decide their fate specification
between a proliferation or a differentiation state into terminal neural
cell types, such as neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes.4 In particular, the coordinated orchestration
of activator and repressor markers in the promoter region of essential
neurogenesis-regulating genes epigenetically controls cell fate specification.5 Notch signaling machinery is known to negatively
regulate neurogenesis by promoting stem cell proliferation and gliogenesis.6,7 Synthetic inhibitors of EGF or γ-secretase receptors are known
to regulate Notch signaling and were proclaimed to have clinical prospects
in treating Alzheimer’s disease, but the chronic exposure of
these Notch inhibitors may lead to toxicity.8,9 The
DNA-binding protein RBPJ cooperates with four different Notch receptors
in mature excitatory neurons, and a recent study in a mouse model
showed that RBPJ inhibition did not affect the learning and memory.10 Therefore, the development of RBPJ-based Notch
regulation is gaining attention, as it has a direct impact on key
genes associated with neurogenesis. RBPJ is known to directly regulate
the HES and HEY families of genes,
which are negative regulators of neuronal differentiation.11

HES1 works as a HES1-Gro/TLE complex and
is activated by the binding
of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD).12 The HES1 expression oscillates through a negative response for a
period of 2–3 h during proliferation and is known to be the
master key factor of neurogenesis.13,14 The continued
repression of HES1 and the ensuing expression of
the downstream genes ASCL1/NGN2 shift
the oscillation of neural progenitors in favor of neural differentiation.11 Therefore, direct regulation of HES1 is favored, as it is expected to have better control over neurogenesis
than the Notch inhibitors that operate indirectly by targeting protein–protein
interactions, and rely on the repression of the initial signaling
processes. Consequently, several strategies have been developed to
artificially regulate the HES1 gene expression. MicroRNAs
are known to alter the HES1 expression and induce
NSC differentiation into a specific neural subtype.15,16 Artificial knockdown of the HES1 expression in
NSCs using small interfering RNA (siRNA) showed a significant reduction
of Nestin+ neural progenitor cells and the consequent increase
of Tuj1+ neuronal cells.17 However,
the siRNA strategy encompasses handling difficulties and low chemical
stability. Consequently, there is a need for a clinically friendly
approach to directly control the HES1 expression
and achieve directed differentiation of NSCs into neurons.

Among
the several approaches that are known to regulate the HES1 expression, the use of small molecules is assured to
have clinical potential because this approach is transgene-free and
easily controllable. Accordingly, agalloside, an HES1 dimer inhibitor, was shown to accelerate the differentiation of
mouse NSCs.18 The existing approaches for
small molecule discovery mainly rely on high-throughput screening
of large libraries of small molecules19,20 and are commonly
time-consuming and sometimes unyielding. Our notion is that the promoter-specific
repression of HES1 using a DNA-based synthetic inhibitor
alone could trigger neural differentiation and induce neurogenesis,
thereby obviating the need to screen a huge number of molecules. Dervan
and colleagues discovered selective DNA-binding small molecules called
pyrrole imidazole polyamides (PIPs) containing the N-methylpyrrole units (P) and N-methylimidazole units
(I).21

Following an accepted binding
rule, I/P and P/I in a hairpin structure
bind to G, C and C, G, respectively, whereas P/P pairing binds to
A, T or T, A. PIPs can be predesigned to recognize target DNA sequences
and have been used extensively as a transcription repressor in living
cells,22,23 PIPs could localize inside the nucleus of
cells in a culture dish without any vehicle and have been proved to
be functional in animal models.24,25 Consequently, we intended
to explore the potential of PIPs to modulate DNA–protein interactions
in the HES1 promoter region and induce promoter-specific
transcription suppression. The recombining binding protein suppressor
of hairless (RBPJ) associates with the promoter region of HES1 and regulates transcription in the Notch signaling
pathway.26 By harnessing the sequence information,
we have demonstrated for the first time that PIP could be designed
as a DNA-binding inhibitor of HES1 to modulate key
Notch signaling factors and shift the transcription program in hNSCs
to one that favors neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, the designed
PIP generated neurons with longer neurite outgrowth, thus validating
the efficacy of our DNA-based synthetic strategy in targeted neuronal
differentiation.

Results and Discussion
Previously,
the transcription factor RBPJ was shown to bind the
“(TG) TGGGAA” site.27,28 On the basis
of this report, we interrogated the human HES1 genome
sequence (gi|568815595) from NCBI and detected the binding sequence.
By integrating the existing knowledge on the plausible binding site,
the proximal sequence, and the mode of recognition by PIPs, we designed
two PIPs termed PIP-RBPJ-1 and PIP-RBPJ-2 to target the RBPJ-binding
motif “GGAAAGAA” and “TGGGAA”, respectively
(Figure 1A). Also,
a mismatched PIP-C was synthesized as the control (Figure S1A).

Figure 1 Construction of PIPs to target the RBPJ-binding site in
the promoter
region of HES1. (A) Illustration of the reported14 binding site “(TG) TGGGAA” in
the HES1 promoter region of RBPJ that is essential
in governing the expression of the downstream gene HES1. (B) Chemical structures of the RBPJ-targeting PIPs termed PIP-RBPJ-1
and PIP-RBPJ-2.

According to previous
reports,29 the
PIPs were synthesized using an Fmoc-protected solid-phase synthesis
system and were further purified by reverse-phase flash column chromatography
(Figure S1B,C). The structures of the two
PIPs are shown in Figure 1B. A Tm (melting temperature)
assay was performed using two double-stranded DNA (ODN-1 and ODN-2)
containing the RBPJ binding site and the PIP binding site (Figure S1D) to verify the binding affinity of
the PIPs toward the predesigned target DNA sequence. As shown in Table 1, the addition of
PIP-RBPJ1 resulted in a Tm shift of 26.1
°C for ODN-1 and 18.8 °C for ODN-2, which confirmed the
binding to the target DNA. Similarly, the addition of PIP-RBPJ-2 caused
a Tm shift of 5.1 and 9.6 °C, respectively,
suggesting a relatively lower binding than that observed for PIP-RBPJ-1.
The Tm assay performed using the mismatched
PIP-C showed a Tm shift of only 2.2 °C,
suggesting a weaker binding affinity. Taken together, the results
of the Tm assay demonstrated that between
the PIPs targeting RBPJ, the longer one (i.e., PIP-RBPJ-1) had a relatively
better binding affinity to the target DNA. Furthermore, we verified
the binding affinity of our designed PIPs using a luciferase reporter
assay, which has been widely used to investigate promoter activity
in eukaryotic cell lines.30 We designed
a model for inserting the HES1 promoter region into
the pMCS-Cypridina Luc vectors to clarify that the designer PIP could
operate by inhibiting transcription factor interactions at the target
DNA sequence. In a Notch-active environment, the binding of PIPs is
expected to reduce luciferase activity (Figure 2A). Initially, two plasmids [pMCS-HES1-L
(1009 bp) and pMCS-HES1-S (402 bp)] containing the key component of
the HES1 promoter sequence were assessed using polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) (Figure S2A). Before
cell treatment, we characterized the NSC undifferentiated state by
double staining of SOX2 and NESTIN (Figure S3). Upon transfection of the plasmid into hNSCs using liposome 3000
and coculturing for 2 days, the 1009 bp fragment plasmid showed a
relatively better luciferase activity than did the 402 bp fragment
plasmid (Figure S2B). Therefore, we chose
to employ pMCS-HES1-L for the subsequent studies. After 2 h of transfection,
PIPs at different concentrations (0.5, 2, and 5 μM) were added
to the medium, and their effects were evaluated after 2 days of treatment.
As shown in Figure 2B, PIP-RBPJ-1 significantly (P = 0.011 at 2 μM, P = 0.005 at 5 μM) repressed the promoter activity
by reducing the luciferase emission in a concentration-dependent manner.

assay model of the PIPs. In Notch-active models, the NICD translocates
into the nucleus and operates with RBPJ to activate the downstream
genes. PIP-RBPJ blocks the binding of RBPJ and results in the suppression
of the gene expression. (B) Effect of PIPs on pHES1-L luciferase activity.

the RBPJ antibody in the promoter region of HES1 revealed
a decrease in the amount of the promoter sequence in the PIP-RBPJ-1-treated
hNSCs and not the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-treated hNSCs.

Contrastingly, PIP-RBPJ-2 yielded
no reduction in the HES1 promoter luciferase activity.
Thus, PIP-RBPJ-1 had a better binding
affinity to the HES1 promoter region and notably
altered the binding of the RBPJ protein to the target DNA sequence
in hNSCs. Previously, the ChIP analysis demonstrated the ability of
a designer PIP (PIP-S2) to recognize the cognate sequence in the promoter
of SOX2 and alter the target gene expression by inhibiting the transcription
factor.31 Likewise, here, we performed
the ChIP analysis using the RBPJ antibody to evaluate the blocking
effect of the designed PIP on RBPJ protein in the HES1 promoter region
of hNSCs. As shown in Figure 2C, PIP-RBPJ-1 reduced the binding ability of RBPJ protein
in the promoter region of HES1, as the amount of
the promoter sequence in PIP-RBPJ-1-treated cells (3.86%) decreased
when compared to that observed in DMSO-treated cells (10.68%). This
result suggests that the PIP-RBPJ-1 could operate to block RBPJ inside
a living cell.

This inhibition of RBPJ may induce chromatin
remodeling in the HES1 promoter region and repress
transcription. To evaluate
the bioactivity of PIPs targeting the RBPJ binding site on the endogenous
expression of HES1, we chose to study their effect
on the endogenous expression of HES1. On the basis
of our previous report, we chose to use PIP-RBPJ-1 and PIP-RBPJ-2
at 2 μM for 24 h. In accordance with the pattern observed in
the luciferase assay, the quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR studies
showed that only PIP-RBPJ-1 significantly (P = 0.038)
repressed the HES1 expression (PIP-RBPJ-2 did not
have any notable effect on the HES1 expression) (Figure 3A).

Figure 3 PIP-RBPJ-1 alters the
expression of HES1 and its
regulated downstream genes. (A) Effect of PIP-RBPJ-1 and PIP-RBPJ-2
on the HES1 expression. (B) Expression profile of HES1 in hNSCs treated with PIP-RBPJ-1 at different concentrations
(0.5, 2, and 5 μM) for 24 h. (C) Effect of PIP-RBPJ-1 on the
expression profile of HES1 at various time intervals
(6, 12, 24, and 48 h). Expression profile of (D) ASCL1 and (E) NGN2 in PIP-RBPJ-1-treated hNSCs. The housekeeping
gene β-actin is chosen to normalize the relative gene expression,
as the expression of β-actin did not alter with both PIP-RBPJ-1
and PIP-RBPJ-2 treatment. Three biological replicates were performed,
and the mean ± SD are indicated, *P < 0.05,
**P < 0.01.

It is important to note here that the better binding affinity
of
PIP-RBPJ-1 toward its target DNA sequence and its gene-suppressing
ability is consistent with the pattern observed in the Tm assay. Therefore, the shorter recognition capability
of PIP-RBPJ2 and the resulting nonspecific binding to the target region
are implied to hamper the bioactivity of PIP-RBPJ-2. The concentration
dependency study performed using various concentrations (0.5, 2, and
5 μM) of PIP-RBPJ-1 for 24 h corroborated that PIP has an optimal
gene-repressing ability at 2 μM (Figure 3B). Similarly, a time-dependency study performed
at various time intervals (6, 12, 24, and 48 h) substantiated that
2 μM PIP-RBPJ-1 had significant activity at 12 h (P = 0.006) and 24 h (P = 0.020) (Figure 3C). Interestingly, PIP-RBPJ-1
treatment for just 6 h also yielded significant (P = 0.044) gene repression, suggesting that PIP-RBPJ-1 promptly localizes
to the nuclei of hNSCs and binds the target sequence.

HES1 is
a key antineurogenic protein that harbors a WRPW motif,
a repressor peptide that recruits Groucho’s WD domain and a
histone deacetylase enzyme to suppress downstream genes, such as ASCL1 and NGN2, which are associated with
neural differentiation.32 The oscillatory
expression of HES1 and ASCL1 is
known to decide the cell fate specification between the proliferation
of hNSCs and neural differentiation, respectively.10 Therefore, we performed qRT-PCR at 24 h to verify if the
repression of HES1 could, in turn, induce the endogenous
expression of ASCL1 and NGN2. As
shown in Figure 3D,E,
PIP-RBPJ-1 significantly induced the expression of both ASCL1 (P = 0.047) and NGN2 (P = 0.032) at 24 and 48 h. Therefore, PIP-RBPJ-1 remarkably
resets the oscillatory state of HES1/ASCL1 into a stable state that favored neural differentiation. Subsequently,
we carried out microarray analysis to evaluate the global expression
profile of PIP-RBPJ-1-treated hNSCs using an Affymetrix Human Gene
2.1 ST Array Strip, which covers about 53 617 gene transcripts.
To clarify the effect of PIP-RBPJ-1 both on HES1 and
its regulated downstream genes, we chose to evaluate the hNSCs treated
with 2 μM PIP-RBPJ-1 for 24 h. While keeping a 1.3-fold change
as the cutoff value for a notable gene regulatory effect, PIP-RBPJ-1
was observed to downregulate 373 genes and upregulate 774 genes (t-test, P < 0.05) compared with DMSO
(Figure S4). An ingenuity pathway analysis
of the PIP-RBPJ-1-altered genes revealed Notch signaling as the top
canonical pathway (Table 2). Also, the network analysis of PIP-RBPJ-1-modulated genes
showed that gene networks were associated with neurological diseases
and neural development and function (Figure S5). Because RBPJ is a well-known Notch effector, this result confirmed
the regulatory role of PIP-RBPJ-1 in altering several Notch effectors,
including lunatic fringe (LFNF), which is known to prevent individual
cells from sending and receiving Notch signals at the same time.33 A qRT-PCR analysis validated the microarray
data because the endogenous expression of NOTCH1 and
the Notch ligand jagged1 (JAG1)34 was significantly suppressed by PIP-RBPJ-1 but not by PIP-RBPJ-2
in both 24 h- and 48 h-treated hNSCs (Figure 4). A functional annotation further suggested
that PIP-RBPJ-1-induced genes favor neuronal development (Table S1). Interestingly, PIP-RBPJ-2 did not
decrease the pHES1-L luciferase activity (Figure 2B) and slightly increased the endogenous
expression of HES1 (Figure 3A). Also, PIP-RBPJ-2 increased the endogenous
expression of NOTCH1 and JAG1 (Figure 4A,B). It is important
to note here that PIP-RBPJ-1 and PIP-RBPJ-2 had distinctive bioactivity
even when they both were designed to target the RBPJ protein-binding
region in the HES1 promoter region. The shorter DNA
sequence recognition ability of PIP-RBPJ-2 and the ensuing off-target
effects are suggested to be the reason behind this altered bioactivity.
Also, these data demonstrate the need for a combinatorial approach
to design different PIPs targeting the core promoter region to identify
and characterize the hit PIPs. Together, these data substantiate that
in the Notch-active condition, PIP-RBPJ-1 altered Notch signaling
and shifted hNSCs to differentiate into neural cells.

Considering the
remarkable bioactivity of PIP-RBPJ-1 to reset the
global expression profile in hNSCs, we evaluated the efficacy of PIP-RBPJ-1
to induce neurogenesis in hNSCs. As shown in Figure 5A, hNSCs were treated with PIP-RBPJ-1 every
2 days with the medium exchange up to day 9, using PIP-RBPJ-2 as the
control. A qRT-PCR analysis that was carried out to check the endogenous
expression of the neuronal marker Tuj1 at regular time intervals (days
3, 6, and 9) revealed that until day 3, both PIPs exhibited no effect.
However, at day 6, PIP-RBPJ-1 induced the endogenous expression of
Tuj1, and at day 9, significant (P = 0.047) expression
of Tuj1 was observed (Figure 5B). Immunostaining studies showed a similar pattern in the
gene expression profile, and only PIP-RBPJ-1 (and not PIP-RBPJ-2)
induced Tuj1+ cells (Figure 5C). A calculation of the neuronal induction efficiency
by counting the number of Tuj1+ cells and examining the
neurite length revealed that PIP-RBPJ-1 notably enhanced the generation
of neurons and improved neurite growth by 42.2%/117.5 (efficiency/length)
(Figure 5D, panel PIP-RBPJ-1
and Table S2). PIP-RBPJ-2 showed a relatively
lower effect of 14.4%/59.1 (efficiency/length) (Figure 5D, panel PIP-RBPJ-1 and Table S2). To compare the efficacy of PIP-RBPJ-1 with the
reported protocol, we chose to assess efficiency through immunostaining
at day 9 using a previous protocol35 that
employed cAMP/BDNF as a positive control. As shown in Figure 5E, PIP-RBPJ-1 induced neuronal
differentiation in a fashion similar to that observed using the reported
protocol.35 Similarly, the efficiency analysis
clearly indicated that PIP-RBPJ-1 significantly (P < 0.001) induced neuronal differentiation with 68.4% efficiency,
which is comparable to that observed for the positive control (70.3%)
(Figure 5F). Interestingly,
PIP-RBPJ-1 did not increase glial cells (Figure S6) and hence is suggested to favor neuronal differentiation.
This proof-of-concept study indicates that our designed DNA-binding
inhibitor of HES1 remarkably altered Notch signaling
and induced neuronal differentiation with an efficiency that was comparable
to that observed for the conventional approach targeting protein–protein
interactions.15

Conclusions
Directed differentiation of NSCs using gene-targeting
small molecules
alone presents potential clinical applications in regenerative medicine
to treat neurodegenerative disorders. However, the identification
of small molecules that are capable of targeting specific transcription
machinery is not straightforward because of the involvement of diverse
intrinsic and extrinsic signals. Consequently, the time gap between
the identification of an essential neurogenesis factor and the development
of synthetic ligands that can modulate them has widened in recent
years. Despite the availability of small molecules that target signaling
proteins associated with neurogenesis, there is a demand for developing
DNA-based synthetic small molecules that can precisely alter the specific
transcription machinery related to neurogenesis based on their potential
in regenerative medicine. Moreover, there is a need to reduce the
number of factors necessary to achieve neurogenesis because the current
differentiation protocol requires two or more small molecules targeting
distinct signaling neurogenesis factors. A designer molecule preprogrammed
to target an essential neurogenesis factor could alone trigger neural
differentiation and precisely alter the gene transcription program
to induce neurogenesis by overcoming the clinical barriers associated
with the use of small molecules. Therefore, we chose to construct
a designer molecule using selective DNA-binding PIPs. Basic helix-loop-helix
transcription factors, such as HES1, operate as negative
regulators of neuronal differentiation and govern the transcription
program associated with hNSCs.

To gain chemical control over
neurogenesis, we first designed and
characterized a PIP as the first-ever synthetic DNA-binding inhibitor
of HES1 by harnessing the sequence information to
target the binding site of a transcription factor called RBPJ. A Tm assay suggested the superior binding efficacy
of the PIP termed PIP-RBPJ-1 over that termed PIP-RBPJ-2, and an in
vitro luciferase reporter assay further verified the bioefficacy of
PIP-RBPJ-1. In accordance with the pattern observed in the in vitro
study, PIP-RBPJ-1 alone significantly (P = 0.038)
suppressed the endogenous expression of HES1. The
oscillation between HES1 and its downstream gene ASCL1 is known to decide the fate of hNSCs into either a
proliferation-favoring state or a neural differentiation state. qRT-PCR
of HES1-regulated downstream genes demonstrated that
PIP-RBPJ-1 significantly (P < 0.04) induced the
expression of ASCL1 and NGN2, which
are critical neural system genes. Genome-wide gene expression studies
revealed that PIP-RBPJ1 also regulated the Notch signaling pathway
and shifted the transcription program to favor neuronal differentiation.
This result is in accordance with a previous report that showed that
alteration of Notch signaling induces neuronal migration.36 Moreover, PIP-RBPJ-1 successfully generated
Tuj1 active neurons with longer neurite outgrowth with an efficiency
that was comparable to that of the conventional protocol, suggesting
the potential of this DNA-binding inhibitor to induce targeted differentiation.

Development of artificial tools to regulate Notch signaling is
in increasing demand owing to their clinical potential in treating
neurodegenerative disorders.37 Consequently,
several regulators of Notch signaling such as the inhibitors of the
widely known therapeutic targets of Notch signaling such as EGF or
γ-secretase receptors have been developed.38 However, the mode of action of the inhibitors of EGF and
γ-secretase receptors depends on the repression of the initial
signaling processes. Therefore, these two Notch inhibitors operate
indirectly and hence, the ensuing potential off-target effect is a
major concern. In this regard, our synthetic DNA-based inhibitor PIP-RBPJ-1
directly operates as it is designed to target the key region of the HES1 gene, a critical effector in neural proliferation and
differentiation. However, it is important to note here that although
PIP-RBPJ-1 significantly modulates Notch signaling and minimizes the
probability of side effects, this synthetic DNA-binding inhibitor
is not entirely specific to Notch signaling. To this end, the future
studies will aim to improve the recognition capability of PIP-RBPJ-1
and obviate any potential off-target effects that limit the clinical
application. Because PIPs can be preprogrammed to target specific
DNA sequences of interest, this strategy may be expanded to differentiate
stem cells into a desired neural subtype through the rational design
of distinct PIPs targeting a specific regulatory sequence motif. The
advancement of our DNA-based approach by harnessing the accumulated
sequence information may offer versatile utility to gain chemical
control over neurogenesis, which in turn may have a broad range of
clinical applications.

2 mM, βFGF 20 ng/mL (Invitrogen), EGF 20 ng/mL (Invitrogen),
and Stempro Neural Supplement (Invitrogen) 2%. Cells were cultured
on the poly-l-ornithine 20 μg/mL (SIGMA) and laminin
2 μg/mL (Invitrogen) matrix-coated plate. For the spontaneous
differentiation, the hNSCs were seeded in the coated plate at 2.5
× 104 cells/cm2. After 2 days, the medium
exchange was done with StemPro NSC SFM without the growth factors.
For the neuron differentiation, we used the neuronal differentiation
medium: Neurobasal (GIBCO), B27 supplement 2% (Invitrogen), GlutaMAX-I
Supplement 2 mM, β-mercaptoethanol 0.1 Mm (SIGMA), BDNF 10 ng/mL
(PeproTech), and cAMP 100 μM.35 All
the cells were used between passage 3 and passage 5. Before the treatment
of effectors (designed PIPs and DMSO), we carried out immunostaining
experiments to verify the expression of NESTIN and SOX2 using the
antibodies bought from Abcam (Figure S3). Consistent with our previous report,23 our initial optimization studies showed that until 5 μM, no
significant changes in cell viability were observed.

Construction
of Luciferase Plasmid
The 402 bp and
1009 bp HES1 genes in the promoter region were cloned from the hNSC
genome with an EcoR1 enzyme site in the 5′ prime and a Hind3
enzyme site at the 3′ prime. The promoter segment and the valid pCMCS-Cypridina-Luc
plasmid were double-digested by EcoR1 and Hind3 enzymes in M buffer
for 1 h (TOYOBO), and then the products were purified by Wizard SV
gel and the PCR Clean-up system (Promega Corporation). We then ligated
the vector and the segment by T4 DNA ligase (TOYOBO) at 4 centigrade
overnight and then transfected into the Escherichia
coli JM109 competent cells (TAKARA) following the
given protocol. After attaining the target vectors pMCS-HES1 1K-Luc
and pMCS-HES1 0.4K-Luc, we confirmed it using PCR gel (Figure S2).

Luciferase Reporter Assay
Experiments were performed
by a Piece Renilla Luciferase Glow assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
The hNSCs were seeded at 1 × 104 cells per well at
96-well plates and incubated overnight. The lipofectamine 3000 reagent
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to transfect the constructed plasmids
into the hNSC following the suggested protocol and was incubated for
48 h. After 48 h, luciferase activity was checked to select the better
plasmid for screening the PIPs. For testing the PIP activity, 1 ×
104 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and after 1 day
seeding, the medium exchange was done to the StemPro NSC SFM without
the growth factors. The plasmid pMCS-HES1-L was then transfected,
and PIPs were added after 2 h transfection. The hNSCs were treated
with different concentrations of the PIPs (0.5, 2, 5 μM) for
another 48 h. We then added 10 μL of cell medium supernatant
to the opaque 96-well plate followed by mixing 50 μL working
solution (100× Coelenterazine and Renilla Glow Assay) to each
well. After 10 min for signal stabilization, we programmed the luminometer
by SpectraMax M2/M2e (Molecular Devices) using a 463 nm light to detect
the light output.

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation-PCR
ChIP-PCR was done
following the protocol. hNSCs were cultured and treated with PIPs
(2.0 μM) for 2 days and then fixed by 1% formaldehyde solution
using the nuclear lysis buffer [Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) 10 mM, NaCl 200
mM, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid 10 mM, sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS) 1% (v/v)] on the cell for 10 min on ice. Sonication was then
used to shear the chromatin to ∼200–1000 bp. Dynabeads
Protein G (Invitrogen) was used for IP after pretreating the sample, and
with the first antibody RBPJ (Abcam), samples were rotated for 3 h
at 4 °C by reverse cross-linking with 10% SDS and purified DNA
with QIAGEN quick PCR purification kits. After samples were prepared,
real-time PCR was performed using the following primers: HES1-ChIP-F:
5′-ATTGGCCGCCAGACCTTGTG-3′ and HES1-ChIP-R: 5′-CGGATCCTGTGTGATCCCTAGG-3’.

Tm Assay
DNA duplex (2.5
μM) was mixed with PIPs (5.0 μM) in a 100 μL mixture
containing sodium cacodylate (10 mM, pH 7.0), sodium chloride (10
mM), and 2.5% (v/v) of DMSO. The sequence of ODN-1 5′-CTGTGGGAAAGAAAGTTTGGGAAGTTTCA-3′
and ODN-2 5′-TGTGGGAAAGAAAGT-3′ was duplex DNA. Annealing
was performed by heating the mixture at 95 °C for 5 min and then
decreasing to room temperature for about 3 h. DNA melting was assessed
through the absorbance of the mixture at λ = 260 nm from 25
to 90 °C (1 °C/min, 1 measurement/°C) on a V-650 UV–Vis
spectrophotometer (JASCO).

Quantitative Real-Time PCR
RNA was
extracted using
an RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN), and then the cDNA was reverse-transcribed
from 200 ng total RNA by ReverTra Ace qPCR RT Master Mix with a gDNA
Remover (Toyobo). SYBR green real-time PCR amplifications were carried
out with THUNDERBIRD SYBR qPCR Mix (Toyobo) and analyzed by using
the ABI 7300 Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, USA). The primer
information is in the Supporting Information, Table S3.

Microarray
The hNSCs were treated
with 2 μM of
the compound for 1 day, and then the total RNA was isolated by the
RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN). RNA quality was examined using the Agilent
RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent), and the Gene chip WT PLUS Reagent Kit
(Agilent) was used to amplify RNA into cRNA. After the cRNA purification
and quantitation, ss-cDNA was synthesized. Using the Gene chip WT
Terminal Labeling Kit, we fragmented and labeled the ss-cDNA, and
hybridization was performed in human gene 2.1 ST array strip (Agilent).

Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
The raw data were tabled
with the genes upregulated more than 1.3 fold and the P-value less than 0.05. PIP versus DMSO samples were then subjected
to the network analysis by QIAGEN’s Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
(QIAGEN, www.qiagen.com/ingenuity) software.

Immunostaining
For the hNSCs, immunostaining
of Tuj1
(SYSY) was performed in 3 and 9 days after the 2 μM of compound
treatment, while 0.1% DMSO was used as the negative control. For differentiation,
the medium we used is the StemPro NSC SFM complete medium without
the NSC maintaining factors β-FGF and EGF, and we changed the
medium every 2 days. After 3 days of culture, we fixed the cells using
4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for
30 min at room temperature and then permeabilized the cells by 0.5%
Triton X-100 (Nacalai Tesque) in PBS for 10 min. Bovine serum albumin
(BSA, 5%, Nacalai Tesque) was used for blocking for 1 h at room temperature.
The cells were then incubated with first antibody Tuj1 rabbit anti-human
in the ratio of 1:200 in 1% BSA solutions at 4 °C overnight.
The next day, the second antibody alex488 goat anti-rabbit (Invitrogen)
in the ratio of 1:500 was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclear
staining with 1 μg/mL DAPI/PBS solution was done for 15 min
at room temperature. To check the glial cell differentiation rates,
a 9 day-treated cell was used for immunostaining by the GFAP (Abcam)
antibody using the same protocol. The immunostaining result was checked
using a confocal microscope.

Calculation of Neuron Efficiency
and Counting of the Neurite
Length
The hNSCs treated with PIPs and the control effectors
were fixed and stained with Tuj1 and DAPI to calculate the total neuron
number (Tuj1+) and the total nuclei number (DAPI), respectively.
For each sample, six pictures were taken using confocal (20×)
microscopy, and calculation was done. To calculate the neuronal generation
efficiency, hNSCs treated for 3 and 9 days were calculated. Total
nuclei were counted using imagine J plugin by counting the DAPI, while
total neurons were counted manually. Neuron efficiency was calculated
by the formula below. Neuron efficiency = total neuron number (Tuj1+)/total nuclei number (DAPI). In three days of hNSC treatment,
the neurite length was calculated using the image J plugin Neurite
Tracer39 as the manual. Neurite length
= total neurite length/total neuron number.
