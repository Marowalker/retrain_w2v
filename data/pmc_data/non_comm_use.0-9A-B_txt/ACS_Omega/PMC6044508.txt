In recent years,
there has been an extensive search for a non-invasive
screening technique for early detection of lung cancer. Volatile organic
compound (VOC) analysis in exhaled breath is one such promising technique.
This approach is based on the fact that tumor growth is accompanied
by unique oncogenesis, leading to detectable changes in VOC emitting
profile. Here, we conducted a comprehensive profiling of VOCs and
metabolites from six different lung cancer cell lines and one normal
lung cell line using mass spectrometry. The concomitant VOCs and metabolite
profiling allowed significant discrimination between lung cancer and
normal cell, nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung
cancer (SCLC), as well as between different subtypes of NSCLC. It
was found that a combination of benzaldehyde, 2-ethylhexanol, and
2,4-decadien-1-ol could serve as potential volatile biomarkers for
lung cancer. A detailed correlation between nonvolatile metabolites
and VOCs can demonstrate possible biochemical pathways for VOC production
by the cancer cells, thus enabling further optimization of VOCs as
biomarkers. These findings could eventually lead to noninvasive early
detection of lung cancer and differential diagnosis of lung cancer
subtypes, thus revolutionizing lung cancer treatment.

Introduction
Lung cancer is the
leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally
claiming 1.59 million lives annually.1 It
is typically silent in its early stages as a result of which 84% of
the cases are diagnosed in later stages (3 or 4) when treatment is
ineffective and can no longer provide a cure.2 The five year survival rate increases dramatically from 10 to 80%
if the disease is discovered at stage 1.3 Therefore, the holy grail of lung cancer treatment is early detection.

Exhaled breath volatile organic compound (VOC) analysis is one
promising technique for the noninvasive early detection of lung cancer.
Human breath is a complex mixture of inorganic compounds (mainly nitrogen,
oxygen, and carbon dioxide) as well as more than 500 VOCs.4,5 These VOCs that exist in parts per billion or even parts per trillion
levels are produced by cell metabolism and exhaled into breath through
blood gas exchange in the alveoli. It is well-known that several biochemical
pathways are altered in lung cancer patients;6−8 thus, it is
logical to expect that they would have a different breath VOC profile
with respect to healthy subjects. It has been four decades since Linus
Pauling first identified more than 200 VOCs in human breath using
gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS),8 and many studies have been directed toward identification of breath
VOCs associated with lung cancer.9−12 However, until now, no consistent
list of breath biomarkers for lung cancer has been generated and translated
to clinical practice. This is partly because breath VOC profile is
affected by many confounding factors such as environmental background,
age, gender, diet, medication, smoking history, lifestyle of the individual,
and so on. Prior to its use for clinical diagnosis, one effective
method of investigating biomarkers associated with lung cancer while
bypassing these factors is the study of VOC profiles in the headspace
of in vitro lung cancer cell cultures.13

Lung cancer cell is classified into four major histological
types:
adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, small cell carcinoma, and
large cell carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from epithelial cells
that secrete substances into the ducts or cavities that they line.
Squamous cell carcinomas are from the epithelial cells, which serve
largely to seal the cavity or channel that they line (to protect the
underlying cell populations). Small cell lung carcinomas (whose origin
is still unknown) secrete biologically active peptides. Large cell
carcinoma is a diagnosis of exclusion, indicating that the cells lack
microscopic evidence of all the other histology types.14 The prognosis and treatment options are critically
dependent on the histology of the cancer: chemotherapy and radiation
therapy are usually used for small cell lung cancer (SCLC) because
of its sensitivity to these therapies, while surgery is performed
on most of the non-SCLC (NSCLC) patients.15 For NSCLC patients, the treatment approach also depends on the subhistology.16 Current method to identify cancer types in the
clinic involves the invasive and painful procedure of biopsy. The
accuracy is often limited by the small size of the nodule and ease
of access, especially in its early stages.17 Therefore, an accurate and noninvasive test that could classify
lung cancers would be very valuable for prognosis. Several studies
have investigated VOC profiles from lung cancer cell culture;18−23 however, most of these studies involved only one or two cell lines.
Because of the heterogeneity of lung cancer, cell lines from different
histological origins should be investigated for more accurate results.
So far, few studies have profiled VOCs from different types of lung
cancer cell lines, and the biochemical origins of these VOCs remain
largely unknown.24

In this study,
we cultured six different types of lung cancer cell
lines (two adenocarcinomas, two squamous cell carcinomas, one large
cell carcinoma, and one small cell carcinoma) and one normal small
airway epithelial cell (SAEC) and investigated the VOC profile and
nonvolatile metabolite profile using GC quadrupole time of flight/MS
(GC-Q-TOF/MS). Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of experimental procedures. The primary
objective is to characterize the volatile and metabolic profiles of
various types of lung cancer cells to provide a deeper insight for
differentiating metabolic phenotypes that can be used to distinguish
lung cancer cells and normal cells. On a secondary level, we aim to
find the specific VOCs that can distinguish between different types
of lung cancers, such as NSCLC and SCLC, as well as between subhistologies
within NSCLC. In addition, the metabolites inside the cells were also
profiled to find possible links between VOCs and metabolites.

of experimental procedures.

Results
Data Quality and Compound Identification
To simulate
the natural diversity of lung cancer, six different cell lines that
cover different histologies and a normal epithelia cell line as control
were studied. Earlier studies had studied different types of cells
cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle media (DMEM) to get the
same VOC background.25−27 Here, we used strictly supplier recommended medium
for each cell line to ensure cells are in healthy condition. Microscopic
pictures of seven cell lines grown in a supplier recommended medium
are shown in Figure S1. To obtain reliable
data, we used pooled quality control (QC) samples to monitor the stability
of the GC-MS instrument during the entire experimental period. It
was found that QC samples clustered together in principle component
analysis (PCA) score plots in a metabolic profiling experiment with
high R2 and Q2 values (Figure S2). A total
ion chromatogram (TIC) of blank solid-phase microextraction (SPME)
fiber is shown in Figure S3. Retention
time, m/z, CAS number, and match
score of the compounds identified in the blank sample were listed.
For compound identification, only metabolite features with relative
standard deviations below 30% were used. After performing a series
of data analyses (described in Materials and Methods section), 20 differential VOCs were identified and confirmed with
NIST library with a match and reverse match score of more than 700.
Among them, 13 were further confirmed with analytical standards. In
the metabolic profiling experiment, 37 metabolites were identified
and confirmed with NIST library with a match and reverse match score
of more than 700. Twenty of them were confirmed with pure analytical
standards. A list of 20 VOCs is shown in Table S1. Comparison of match score of the 13 VOCs confirmed with
standards is shown in Table S2. A list
of 37 nonvolatile metabolites is shown in Table S3. Table S4 shows the comparison
of match score of the 20 metabolites confirmed with standards. Examples
of TIC for VOCs and metabolites are shown in Figures S4 and S5, respectively. Each TIC is labeled with the compounds
identified. For those compounds that have been confirmed with standards,
a parallel comparison of the spectrum in sample and standard is shown
in Figure S6 for VOCs and Figure S7 for nonvolatile metabolites.

VOC Profiling
Before comparing VOC profile across different
cell lines, the trend of VOCs in each cell line compared with its
respective medium control was analyzed and shown in Table 1. Significant differences were
observed between the VOC profiles from cancer cells and their respective
medium controls; in contrast, normal lung epithelial cells caused
fewer changes to their medium VOC component. In general, lung cancer
cells emit more alcohols (2-ethyl-1-hexanol, 2,4-decadien-1-ol, and
cyclohexanol), whereas there is no significant change in normal SAECs
compared to its medium. 2-Methyl pentane was found to increase significantly
in all cancer cells but not in SAECs. Most of the benzene derivatives
decreased in the NSCLC cell, in contrast to the increase in SCLC cells.
Meanwhile, there was no significant change in SAECs.

For comparison across different
cell lines, a correction of the
VOC concentrations due to different growth medium was performed. Specifically,
the fold change of concentration of each VOC from cell to that from
its medium control was calculated. PCA and orthogonal projections
to latent structures-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) plot using identified
features showed clear separation between cancer cells and normal cells
(Figure 2). The plot
also demonstrated that SCLC was distinct from NSCLC. Within NSCLC,
large cell carcinoma was noted to be clearly separated from the rest.
However, there was overlap between adenocarcinoma and squamous carcinoma
cells. The high R2X, R2Y, and Q2 values indicate the validity of the
PCA and OPLS-DA model. To better illustrate the degree of increase
or decrease in the VOCs, the fold change of each VOC in the cell to
that in the medium control was calculated, log 2-transformed, and
then plotted in the color-coded map and shown in Figure 3a. Positive values indicate
emission of the VOC, whereas negative values indicate consumption
from the medium. To further identify the VOCs that can be used to
distinguish cancer cells versus normal cells, NSCLC versus SCLC, as
well as large cell carcinoma versus other NSCLC, receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed between these groups. Figure S3 shows the ROC curve of VOCs with area
under curve (AUC) values of more than 0.9 in each analysis. The VOCs
that distinguish cancer versus noncancer and large cell versus other
NSCLC were found to be the same: 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, 2,4-decadien-1-ol,
and benzaldehyde. Figure 3b shows a box plot of fold change of these three VOCs.

Metabolite Profiling
We further investigated the nonvolatile
metabolite profile of the seven cell lines. PCA and OPLS-DA analysis
showed clear distinct clusters of the seven types of cell lines with
high R2X, R2Y, and Q2 values (Figure 4). The relative concentration of each metabolite was
linearly normalized into the range of −1 to 1 and plotted in
the heat map shown in Figure 5a. Higher value represents higher relative concentration and
vice versa. To better reveal the difference of various classes of
metabolites between different cell lines, a box plot of the sum of
the concentration of the amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleotides
is shown in Figure 5b.

Discussion
In-depth and comprehensive characterization
of tumor phenotypes
will lead to early diagnosis and therapeutic strategies. Recently,
metabolomics have been extensively used to identify the biomarkers
of various diseases. The application to cancer study is beneficial
because it reflects the biochemical compositions of cancer-type-specific
pathophysiological processes. Studying the VOC and metabolic profile
of in vitro cancer cells provides an elegant alternative to non-invasive
cancer diagnostics and bypass many confounding factors associated
with human samples. However, its application is limited by a lack
of validated cancer biomarkers and the largely unknown origins of
VOCs. Here, we analyzed the VOCs in the headspace and the intracellular
metabolites from six different lung cancer cell lines and one normal
lung epithelial cell line as control. We aim to find differential
VOCs and metabolites that can discriminate between cancer and normal
cells, as well as between different subtypes of lung cancer. By linking
the metabolites and VOC profiles, we also investigate the possible
biochemical origins of VOCs.

VOC and Metabolite Differences between Lung
Cancer and Noncancerous
Cells
2-Methyl pentane increased significantly in all types
of cancer cells with respect to the medium, but there was no significant
change in the case of SAEC. In previous studies, 2-methyl pentane
was found to have increased in lung adenocarcinoma NCI-H2087.21 Higher concentration of 2-methyl pentane was
also reported in NSCLC patients’ breath,28−30 The main mechanism
that affects the emission of alkanes is oxidative stress. Alkanes
are mainly produced by the peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids
by reactive oxygen species,31,32 via lipid peroxidation.
Hence, the increased level of 2-methyl pentane in cancer cells reflects
the increased level of oxidative stress in cancer cells. 2-Ethyl-1-hexanol
and 2,4-decadien-1-ol increased significantly in all three types of
NSCLCs. However, the level of these two alcohols increased only slightly
in SCLCs and did not change at all in SAECs. A significant increase
in 2-ethyl-1-hexanol has been observed from lung adenocarcinoma.21,33 Study on lung cancer patients’ breath also revealed a higher
concentration of 2-ethyl-1-hexanol than in healthy control.34 2-Ethyl-1-hexanol was also found exclusively
in lung cancer patients’ saliva samples but not in other cancer
patients’ saliva.35 It was postulated
that alcohols are produced by the oxidation of alkanes by cytochrome
p450 (CYP450), a group of enzymes that are over-activated in lung
cancer tissue.32 As alkanes result from
lipid peroxidation resulting from oxidative stress, the increased
level of these two alcohols could be the result of increased oxidative
stress and upregulated CYP450.

At the cellular metabolite level,
significant differences were observed between cancer cells and normal
epithelial cells. The most conspicuous difference was at the glucose
level. As described by the famous “Warburg effect”,
a major hallmark of cancer cells is their high rate of glycolysis
even in aerobic conditions to meet their high energy expenditure.36 Our results showed that glucose was much lower
in all cancer cells, which suggest the rapid consumption of glucose
through glycolysis. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins
and are essential for cell proliferation.37 Our results showed that amino acids were about threefold higher
in cancer cells than in SAECs, except for H520, in which comparable
lower levels of amino acids were observed. The accumulation of amino
acids could be attributed to the increased uptake by cancer cells
because of the increase in protein synthesis as well as energy consumption.
Glutamine is a critical source of energy for cancer cells and also
a nitrogen donor for the synthesis of other amino acids. Asparagine
was found to regulate the uptake of other amino acids such as serine,
arginine, and histidine. It is also involved in coordinating nucleotide
synthesis.38 The accumulated evidence also
suggests that tumors preferentially uptake branched-chain amino acids
such as leucine, isoleucine, and valine because they are essential
nutrients for cancer growth and are used as a source of energy.39 Tang et al. studied the coexpression pattern
of tyrosine-protein kinase (MET) and epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) in 11 lung cancer cell lines, including A549, H226, and H520.40 It was found that H520 is MET-negative/EGFR-negative,
whereas A549 and H226 have strong expression of both genes. Both of
these two genes encode receptors that regulate many physiological
processes including proliferation. This could explain the fact that
H520 has much lower levels of amino acids than all the other lung
cancer cell lines.

Fatty acids are used for both structural
and functional purposes.
It was reported that β-oxidation of fatty acids is an important
source of energy production in cancer cells.41 This is also consistent with our results where lower levels of fatty
acids were observed in cancer cells. Nucleotides are required for
many biological processes in all cells. During cell proliferation,
increased nucleotide synthesis is essential for DNA replication and
RNA production.39 Higher levels of nucleotides
in cancer cells observed in our study confirm this.

VOC Profile
of Different Histological Types of Lung Cancer
ROC analysis
revealed that SCLC can be distinguished from NSCLC
by m- and p-xylenes, ethylbenzene,
styrene, o-xylene, 1,3-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-benzene,
and 2,4-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-phenol; each of these VOCs has AUC
values higher than 0.95. SCLC occurs almost exclusively in smokers,
whereas NSCLC occurs in both smokers and nonsmokers.42−44 Increased levels of benzene derivatives might reflect the smoking
habits of the donor from which the cell line was established.

2,4-Decadien-1-ol, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, and benzaldehyde are the key
compounds differentiating the large cell carcinoma level of these
three VOCs that are higher in large cell carcinoma than in adenocarcinoma
and squamous cell carcinoma. Benzaldehyde was previously found to
be decreased in cell lines with squamous cell carcinoma histology
as compared with adenocarcinomas cells.24 In our study, a similar trend was observed. The level of benzaldehyde
was the highest in large cell carcinoma, followed by adenocarcinoma
and then by squamous carcinoma. Benzaldehyde in human breath was postulated
to be related to environmental factors;45 its origin in cells is still unknown.

Links between VOCs and
Metabolites
To reveal the links
between VOCs and cellular metabolites, a Pearson’s correlation
test was performed; the correlation coefficient is shown in Figure 6. The level of 2-methyl
pentane is negatively correlated with the levels of all detected fatty
acids (except for butanedioic acid). Cancer cells have lower levels
of intracellular fatty acids but higher level of 2-methyl pentane.
This is consistent with the postulation that oxidation of fatty acids
results in alkanes as a volatile byproduct.31,32 Levels of 2-ethyl-1-hexanol and 2,4-decadien-1-ol were strongly
negatively correlated with the levels of three amino acids (leucine,
ornithine, and glycine), glucose, cholesterol, as well as many fatty
acid molecules (hexadecanoic acid, octadecanoic acid, cyclohexaneacetic
acid, 3-ketovaleric acid, aminomalonic acid, and tetradecanoic acid).
This suggested that the production of these two alcohols may be associated
with multiple cellular metabolism pathways. Benzaldehyde has a strong
negative correlation with glucose, cholesterol, and several fatty
acid molecules. Levels of propanal and nonanal are negatively correlated
with most amino acids identified. Cancer cells have lower levels of
propanal and nonanal but higher levels of amino acids. This suggests
that these two aldehydes could be the precursors in amino acid anabolism
pathways. The exact biochemical pathways for VOCs are largely unknown.
It has been postulated that alkanes are produced from the peroxidation
of lipids, and they will be further oxidized into alcohols by P450,
which can be further oxidized into aldehydes and carboxylic acids
by alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenese, respectively.31,32 Here, we observed higher levels of alkane and lower levels of fatty
acids in cancer cells. The increased level of two hydrocarbons is
likely due to the fast oxidation of fatty acids in cancer cells. We
also observed increased level of several alcohols in cancer cells
which could be due to the increased level of P450, oxidizing alkanes
into alcohols. However, observations from the current study are correlative
only; further studies are needed to identify the exact biochemical
pathway for each specific VOC.

Figure 6 Pearson’s correlation between VOCs
and nonvolatile metabolites.

Conclusions
In this study, we conducted a comprehensive
profiling of VOCs emitted
by different cell lines and also their respective nonvolatile cellular
metabolites by using GC-Q-TOF-MS. Both the VOC and cellular metabolite
profiles allowed significant discrimination between lung cancer and
normal epithelial cells. The data demonstrated that cellular metabolite
profiles also allowed discrimination between each specific cell lines.
Using VOC profile, we were able to discriminate small cell carcinoma
from nonsmall cell carcinoma; within nonsmall cell carcinoma, large
cell carcinoma has a distinct VOC profile. A correlation test also
reveals possible biochemical pathways of VOCs. These findings could
eventually lead to early noninvasive screening for lung cancer as
well as differential diagnosis of different histological types of
lung cancer, thus saving millions of lives and reducing healthcare
cost dramatically.

Materials and Methods
Human Lung Cell Culture
Seven human lung cell lines
were used: lung adenocarcinoma A549, lung large cell carcinoma H460
(kindly provided by Prof Shen Han-Ming, Department of Physiology,
National University of Singapore), SAEC (kindly provided by Prof Bay
Boon Huat, Department of Anatomy, National University of Singapore),
lung squamous carcinoma H520, H226, lung adenocarcinoma HCC827, and
lung small cell carcinoma H526 were purchased from ATCC, United States.
Cell lines have been propagated using the formulation suggested by
ATCC. A549 was cultured in DMEM high-glucose medium supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum. H460, H226, H520, HCC827, H526, and MRC5 were
cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.
The human SAEC was cultured in SAGM (Lonza, Singapore). All cell lines
were cultured under standard conditions at 37 °C in humidified
atmosphere in 5% CO2. One million of each cell line was
cultured in 12 mL of respective medium in Petri dish with a diameter
of 10 cm. After 72 h of growth, the conditioned medium was collected
into 20 mL headspace vials, three types of growth medium without any
cells were cultured under the same condition as control groups for
VOC profiling. For metabolite profiling, the cells were trypsinized,
counted with a hemocytometer, washed with phosphate-buffered saline
once, autoclaved with DI water once, and then frozen at −80 °C
for further processing. All the cell line samples and control samples
were prepared in 4–6 replicates.

Reagents and Analytical
Standards
N-Methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide
(MSTFA),
methoxy-amine hydrochloride, FOMC-glycine, and pyridine were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich. A liquid mixture of 53 VOC standards was purchased
from AccuStandard. Twelve VOC standards were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
including 2-methyl pentane, pentane, 2-butanone, isoprene, acetaldehyde,
propanal, pentanal, hexanal, heptanal, octanal, monanal, and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol.
Twenty nonvolatile metabolite standards were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
VOC standards and metabolite standards were diluted and measured using
the same methods for measuring samples.

VOC Profiling: SPME and
GC-Q-TOF/MS Conditions
A medium
(5 mL) was sealed in a 20 mL headspace vial (Agilent Technologies,
Singapore) with a polytetrafluoroethylene/silicone crimp seal and
stored at 4 °C until analysis. The fiber used was 50/30 μm
Carboxen/DVB/PDMS, Stableflex, 24 Ga (Agilent Technologies, Singapore).
A new fiber was conditioned at 270 °C for 1 h before use. Before
running each sample, the fiber was conditioned at 250 °C for
10 min. Sample vials were incubated on a PAL autosampler in incubation
module at 40 °C for 30 min. The extraction time is 20 min, and
the desorption time is 30 s.

The analysis of VOCs on the SPME
fiber was performed with an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph with 7200
quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (GC-Q-TOF/MS). The separation
was performed on a DB-5MS capillary column, 30 m length × 0.25
mm i.d. × 0.25 μm thickness, and conducted in splitless
modes using ultrahigh-purity helium as the carrier gas with a flow
rate of 1 mL/min. The oven temperature was held at 40 °C for
4 min, increased by 5 °C/min to 100 °C, increased at 10
°C/min to 120 °C, increased at 20 °C/min to 300 °C,
and finally held at this temperature for 6 min; the total run time
was 33 min. The injection port was held at 250 °C. The injection
mode is splitless. The ion source was operated in an electron ionization
mode, and its temperature was 230 °C. The mass scan range for
TOF was from m/z 20 to 500. Mass
calibration was conducted for every six samples to maintain high mass
accuracy. One QC sample was run every six samples to evaluate instrument
stability.

Metabolite Profiling: Sample Preparation
and GC-Q-TOF/MS Conditions
The sample preparation protocol
was adopted from previous studies.46,47 The cell pellet
was freeze-dried overnight. Methanol (500 μL)
and water (4:1, v/v) containing 25 μg/mL of FMOC-glycine as
the internal standard were added to each cell pellet sample for metabolite
extraction. The samples were then homogenized for 10 min at 25 Hz
in TissueLyser (Qiagen, USA). The samples were then sonicated for
10 min in an ice water bath to improve the extraction efficiency.
Followed by sonication, the samples were centrifuged at 14 000
rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and 20
μL was used for derivatization and GC/MS. For derivatization,
20 μL of the sample was transferred into a glass shell vial
and dried in a CentriVap concentrator (Labconco, USA). Two steps of
derivatization were carried out first with 100 μL of methoxyamine
in pyridine (5 mg/mL) at 60 °C for 2 h and second with 100 μL
of MSTFA at 37 °C for 16 hours. After derivatization, the samples
were transferred to a GC vial and run within the same day. 20 μL
was taken out from each sample to form a pooled QC sample and then
split into seven QC samples.

For GC-MS analysis, an Agilent
7890A gas chromatograph with 7200 quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer
(GC-Q-TOF/MS) was used. The separation was performed on a DB-5MS capillary
column, 30 m length × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 μm thickness,
and conducted in splitess modes using ultra-high purity helium as
a carrier gas with a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The injection volume was
1 μL. The oven temperature was held at 90 °C for 1 min
and increased by 20 °C/min to 130 °C, increased at 6 °C/min
to 280 °C, and then increased at 25 °C/min to 300 °C,
the latter temperature was held for 6 min, and the total run time
was 34.8 min. The solvent cut time was 4.5 min. The ion source was
operated in an electron ionization mode, and its temperature was 230
°C. The mass scan range for TOF was from m/z 50 to 800. Mass calibration was conducted for every six
samples to maintain high mass accuracy. One QC sample was run every
six samples to evaluate the instrument stability.

Data Analysis
Raw
Data Analysis
The raw chromatogram data from GC/MS
were first transformed to mzData files in MassHunter Qualitative analysis
software (Agilent) and then exported to Mzmine software for feature
detection and alignment. The aligned features were normalized through
QC samples for VOC profiling and through internal standards and cell
number for metabolite profiling. The features were then screened using
two criteria: relative standard deviation ≤ 30% and detection
frequency ≥ 6/6. PCA and OPLS-DA were performed in SIMCA-P.
Kruskal–Wallis test for comparison between more than two groups
was performed using Multi Experiment Viewer software. The features
with variable importance in project scores above 1 in the OPLS-DA
model and p-value less than 0.05 in the Kruskal–Wallis
test were considered to be statistically significant. The heat map
was plotted using Plotly.

Metabolite Identification
The metabolites were identified
on the basis of mass spectra and accurate mass fragments by searching
NIST 11 library; only compounds with a match and reverse match score
of more than 700 were reported. Thirteen VOC standards and 20 metabolite
standards (as mentioned in Materials and Methods section) were analyzed
through the same respective GC-MS methods to confirm the retention
time and mass spectrum of each compound.
