Metal-organic
frameworks (MOFs) are promising gas adsorbents. Knowledge
of the behavior of gas molecules adsorbed inside MOFs is crucial for
advancing MOFs as gas capture materials. However, their behavior is
not always well understood. In this work, carbon dioxide (CO2) adsorption in the microporous α-Zn3(HCOO)6 MOF was investigated. The behavior of the CO2 molecules
inside the MOF was comprehensively studied by a combination of single-crystal
X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) and multinuclear solid-state magnetic resonance
spectroscopy. The locations of CO2 molecules adsorbed inside
the channels of the framework were accurately determined using SCXRD,
and the framework hydrogens from the formate linkers were found to
act as adsorption sites. 67Zn solid-state NMR (SSNMR) results
suggest that CO2 adsorption does not significantly affect
the metal center environment. Variable-temperature 13C
SSNMR experiments were performed to quantitatively examine guest dynamics.
The results indicate that CO2 molecules adsorbed inside
the MOF channel undergo two types of anisotropic motions: a localized
rotation (or wobbling) upon the adsorption site and a twofold hopping
between adjacent sites located along the MOF channel. Interestingly, 13C SSNMR spectroscopy targeting adsorbed CO2 reveals
negative thermal expansion (NTE) of the framework as the temperature
rose past ca. 293 K. A comparative study shows that carbon monoxide
(CO) adsorption does not induce framework shrinkage at high temperatures,
suggesting that the NTE effect is guest-specific.

Introduction
Gas separation and
capture are essential for many industrial processes,
such as chemical production, flue gas purification, and natural gas
treatment.1 Various separation techniques
have been developed. However, these procedures are typically energy
intensive,2 motivating research into alternative
separation and capture techniques.3−5 Metal-organic frameworks
(MOFs) are crystalline solids with metal-based nodes linked by organic
bridges6−8 and are strong candidates among the suggested technologies.3,9−12 MOFs have permanent porosities and large surface areas, making them
promising for gas adsorption.3 As a solid
adsorbent, MOFs can provide a more energy-efficient approach than
conventional chemical absorption methods.9,13 As
compared to traditional porous materials such as zeolites, MOFs are
more versatile and adaptable as their gas adsorption performance can
be optimized by systematically varying the metal centers and organic linkers.9,11,13−15 These promising
attributes of MOFs and the pressing need for alternative gas adsorbents
have led to a rapid growth in novel MOF synthesis.16,17 Nonetheless, the detailed adsorption behaviors of many MOFs are
still unknown.

M3(HCOO)6 (M = Mg, Zn,
Mn, Co, Ni, and Fe),18−37 a family of microporous MOFs constructed from formate linkers, has
shown great potential as gas capture media. These MOFs are thermally
robust (stable up to ca. 400–500 K)18−21,31,35 and can be synthesized using relatively
straightforward procedures and inexpensive reagents.36−38 M3(HCOO)6 frameworks are also capable of guest
adsorption.19−24,27,33,39−44 For instance, α-Mg3(HCOO)6 has demonstrated
remarkable results for carbon dioxide (CO2) capture.27,39,40,42 A 27.4 kJ mol–1 isosteric heat of CO2 adsorption (Qst(CO2)) was
measured,27 which is among the highest
found for MOFs without open metal sites or basic (i.e., nonacidic)
functional groups.45 Selective gas adsorption
ability was also reported,27,42,46,47 with preferential adsorption
for CO2 over methane and nitrogen gas.27 Although there is abundant knowledge on CO2–α-Mg3(HCOO)6 systems, experimental reports on CO2 adsorption using other M3(HCOO)6 frameworks
are relatively scarce and have only been performed for the Mn analogue.22,29,42 Furthermore, CO2 has
been the focus of many gas-loaded M3(HCOO)6 studies.
However, there is limited information on other gas–M3(HCOO)6 systems. To the best of our knowledge, carbon
monoxide (CO) adsorption in M3(HCOO)6 has yet
to be studied. Since a complete characterization of gas–MOF
systems is crucial for identifying successful gas absorbents, these
knowledge gaps must be filled to advance MOF-based gas capture technologies.

Besides α-Mg3(HCOO)6, α-Zn3(HCOO)6 has also shown promising gas adsorption
abilities. α-Zn3(HCOO)6 has the same topology
as α-Mg3(HCOO)6 but contains a different
metal center. Four crystallographically inequivalent Zn atoms act
as metal nodes in α-Zn3(HCOO)6 (Figure 1).21 Each Zn center is fully coordinated to six formate oxygens,
resulting in a slightly distorted [ZnO6] octahedron. The
extended α-Zn3(HCOO)6 lattice is constructed
from chains of edge-sharing [ZnO6] octahedra that are further
connected by vertex-sharing [ZnO6] octahedra. This arrangement
results in zigzag-shaped porous channels that propagate along the
crystallographic b axis. The channel interiors are
lined with formate hydrogens and oxygens, which have been shown to
act as guest adsorption sites.21,43 Even though α-Zn3(HCOO)6 and α-Mg3(HCOO)6 have the same topology, differences in adsorption behavior can still
be expected. Gas affinity differences have been observed between various
M3(HCOO)6 frameworks.23,42,43,46 In the case
of α-Zn3(HCOO)6 and α-Mg3(HCOO)6, computational investigations have shown that
α-Zn3(HCOO)6 binds stronger to acetylene,
methane, nitrogen, hydrogen, and CO2 compared to α-Mg3(HCOO)6.46 Similar results
were also obtained in a recent methane adsorption study, in which
a stronger methane–MOF interaction was detected for α-Zn3(HCOO)6 due to its smaller pore size.43 These studies suggest that α-Zn3(HCOO)6 can be a more efficient gas adsorbent than the
Mg analogue due to the structural effects of accommodating the larger
metal center. Unfortunately, limited experimental characterization
has been conducted on the gas adsorption ability of α-Zn3(HCOO)6. Besides methane,43 its adsorption behavior has only been studied for hydrogen, nitrogen,
iodine, and several solvents.21

and (d).

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction
(SCXRD) is commonly employed to
characterize the structure of guest-loaded MOFs.48−51 SCXRD probes the long-range crystal
structure and can provide information on framework connectivity and
geometries with atomic resolution. In ideal cases, SCXRD can also
accurately locate the guest molecules, identify the guest binding
sites, and determine the site occupancies. SCXRD has been widely employed
in MOF characterization to study gas adsorption52−55 and monitor framework structural
transformations.56−58 Even though SCXRD is a powerful structural characterization
method, MOF single crystals of suitable size and quality can be difficult
to obtain. Furthermore, detailed guest dynamics studies can be challenging
to conduct since SCXRD experiments only provide time-averaged structural
data and are commonly performed at cryogenic temperatures that restrict
or immobilize guests. In these cases, the pairing of SCXRD with solid-state
nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) spectroscopy can provide fruitful
results. SSNMR spectroscopy probes short-range ordering and local
structure. It can provide insights into host–guest interactions59−61 and guest dynamics.41,62−70 Both metal– and linker–guest interactions can be directly
examined using SSNMR,39,66,67,71,72 allowing for
the main adsorptive interactions to be identified. Moreover, molecular
motion can alter the SSNMR spectral appearance in a predictable manner
due to the anisotropic nature of most NMR interactions. Therefore,
motional information (i.e., the types of motions and the parameters
defining the motions) can be obtained from variable-temperature (VT)
SSNMR experiments via spectral simulations.73 With knowledge of the crystal structure, a detailed motional model
can be developed for guests within MOF frameworks.41,63−67,70 Thus, the combination of SSNMR
spectroscopy and SCXRD can provide a complete picture of guest behavior
inside MOFs.

Here, we studied CO2 and CO adsorption
within α-Zn3(HCOO)6. The guest binding
sites and adsorption
mechanism were identified by SCXRD. Static VT 13C SSNMR
spectroscopy was employed to examine the guest dynamics, and a motional
model was developed for the adsorbed guests. Unexpected trends in
the chemical shift (CS) tensor parameters and motional parameters
as a function of temperature were observed during our CO2 study, indicating the negative thermal expansion (NTE) of the framework.
The presence of NTE was also supported by 1H → 13C cross-polarization (CP) NMR experiments. Lastly, we compared
the dynamics of CO2 adsorbed in α-Zn3(HCOO)6 to those adsorbed in similar MOFs.

Results and Discussion
Behavior
of CO2 Adsorbed in α-Zn3(HCOO)6
To determine the number and location
of guest adsorption sites in α-Zn3(HCOO)6, we have solved the crystal structure of CO2-loaded α-Zn3(HCOO)6 using SCXRD (Figure 1). CO2-loaded α-Zn3(HCOO)6 crystallizes in the monoclinic system (space group P21/n) with
unit cell parameters a = 11.326(2) Å, b = 9.821(1) Å, c = 14.441(2) Å,
and β = 91.297(5)°. The crystallographic data are summarized
in Tables S1–S7. Like the empty
MOF, the CO2-loaded α-Zn3(HCOO)6 has four crystallographically inequivalent Zn atoms sitting in the
center of slightly distorted [ZnO6] octahedra. Similar
to the activated α-Zn3(HCOO)6, the framework
contains the chains of edge-sharing [ZnO6] connected by
vertex-sharing [ZnO6], with porous channels running along
the crystallographic b axis. The CO2 guests
were found near the walls of the porous channels, forming zigzag CO2 chains with neighboring CO2 ca. 5 Å apart.
The CO2 molecules sitting at the top of the zigzag array
are crystallographically equivalent to those at the bottom of the
array. Thus, α-Zn3(HCOO)6 contains only
one distinct CO2 adsorption site. The guests also display
relatively large and anisotropic ellipsoids at 120 K (Figures 2 and S1). The thermal ellipsoids extend toward the adjacent CO2, suggesting that the adsorbed CO2 molecules move between
neighboring adsorption sites even at 120 K.

Figure 2 (a) CO2-loaded
α-Zn3(HCOO)6 MOF channel with atoms appearing
as thermal ellipsoids. The ellipsoids
are at the 50% probability level. Hydrogens, framework carbons, and
[ZnO6] units connecting the top and bottom of the channel
are omitted for clarity. (b) Local pore structure of CO2-loaded α-Zn3(HCOO)6. One of the CO2 oxygens (O2) points toward the three formate hydrogens (H1,
H5, and H6) that extend into the channel. Carbons are dark gray, oxygens
are red, hydrogens are white, and [ZnO6] units are purple
octahedra.

Insights into the host–guest
interaction were also obtained
via SCXRD. First, the [ZnO6] octahedra in the CO2-loaded α-Zn3(HCOO)6 and the empty framework
have equivalent O–Zn–O angles and Zn–O distances
(Table S8). Therefore, CO2 adsorption
does not alter the immediate environment of the Zn centers, and the
adsorbed CO2 molecules clearly do not interact with the
Zn. This result is confirmed by 67Zn SSNMR spectroscopy
(Figures S2 and S3), and a detailed discussion
on the 67Zn SSNMR data is given in the Supporting Information. Moreover, the adsorbed CO2 are located close to the framework hydrogens (Hframework), with one of its oxygens (O2) pointing toward the three Hframework (H1, H5, and H6) that extend into the channel (Figure 2). The O2···Hframework distances range from 2.91 to 3.03 Å, which are
noticeably shorter than those between CO2 and other framework
atoms (Figure S4). Although the crystal
structure of α-Mg3(HCOO)6 loaded with
CO2 has not been reported, computational studies have shown
that CO2 in α-Mg3(HCOO)6 are
also located near the Hframework.39,46 The adsorption is driven by Hframework···O=C=O
interactions, and the O···Hframework distance
was calculated to be ca. 3.2 Å.39 Since
the O2···Hframework distances for CO2 in α-Zn3(HCOO)6 are also close
to 3.2 Å, this suggests that Hframework···O=C=O
interactions are also responsible for CO2 adsorption in
α-Zn3(HCOO)6. Weak hydrogen bonds have
been reported as the main host–guest interaction for other
guests (e.g., tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, acetone) in α-Zn3(HCOO)6, with hydrogen bond acceptors primarily
interacting with the Hframework.21

Static VT 13C SSNMR experiments were conducted
from
123 to 433 K on CO2-loaded α-Zn3(HCOO)6 to investigate CO2 motions, and the spectra are
shown in Figure 3.
Since isotopically labeled 13CO2 gas was used,
only CO2 signals will contribute significantly to the spectra.
A narrow resonance at ca. 126 ppm was found from 273 to 433 K and
is attributed to unbound CO2. This assignment is consistent
with the 132 ppm isotropic chemical shift (δiso)
value previously reported for free CO2.74 A 13C powder pattern was also observed at each
temperature, which is ascribed to CO2 bound to the framework.
The observation of a single powder pattern indicates the presence
of one unique adsorption site, consistent with the SCXRD results.

Figure 3 (a) Experimental
static VT 13C SSNMR spectra of 13CO2-loaded α-Zn3(HCOO)6 recorded from 123
to 433 K at 9.4 T, and (b) the corresponding analytical
simulations. Asterisk (*) denotes the unbound CO2 resonance.
The spectra simulated from 273 to 433 K are given as summations (dotted
black trace) of the adsorbed (solid blue trace) and free (solid red
trace) CO2 signals. The 13C CS tensor parameters
obtained from the analytical simulations are provided in Table S10.

The VT 13C spectra were analytically simulated
(Figure 3), and the
apparent 13C CS tensor parameters obtained for adsorbed
CO2 are provided in Table S10. Compared to
the CS tensor span (Ω) of rigid CO2 (335 ppm),74 the recorded Ω values of CO2 in α-Zn3(HCOO)6 are consistently smaller
(ca. 128–36 ppm from 123 to 433 K). In agreement with the large
CO2 thermal ellipsoids obtained from SCXRD, the smaller
Ω implies that the CO2 still displays motions despite
being confined in the framework. This is further supported by the
dependence of Ω and skew (κ) on temperature. The motional
behavior of CO2 in MOFs has been well documented, and the
static 13C SSNMR line shapes of CO2 have been
consistently observed to vary with temperature.39,63,64,66−70,75 The Ω and/or κ generally
exhibit unidirectional change with temperature. For example, the Ω
usually decreases with increasing temperature due to the increased
mobility of CO2 at higher temperatures.66,67,70,75 However, this
is not the case for CO2 in α-Zn3(HCOO)6. In the temperature range of 123–293 K, the Ω
indeed decreases monotonically with increasing temperature as expected
(Table S10 and Figure S5). The trend is
reversed in the high-temperature range of 293–433 K. Above
293 K, instead of decrease, the Ω increases slightly with increasing
temperature. A larger Ω is typically associated with decreased
CO2 mobility.66 The temperature
dependence of Ω from 293 to 433 K suggests that within this
temperature range, the degree of CO2 motion decreases with
increasing temperature. The κ also exhibits a similar trend.
We attribute the observed peculiar temperature dependencies of Ω
and κ of 13CO2 adsorbed in α-Zn3(HCOO)6 to the NTE of the MOF at temperatures above
293 K as the slight shrinkage of the framework resulting from the
NTE can lead to a more confined CO2 with reduced mobility.
Even though the NTE has yet to be reported for α-Zn3(HCOO)6, it has been observed in other Zn formate MOFs.76,77 For instance, the Zn octahedra and formate linkers of Zn(HCOO)2·2(H2O) distort upon heating.76 This results in a “hinge-strut”-like framework
motion and an anisotropic thermal expansion of the framework with
NTE along the crystallographic c axis (i.e., the
unit cell shrinks along the c axis as temperature
increases). Similar observations were reported for the [CH3NH3][Zn(HCOO)3] and [C(NH2)3][Zn(HCOO)3] frameworks, which displayed moderate
NTE along the c axis when the temperature was raised
from 110 to 300 K.77

To further examine
the CO2 dynamics, 13C
SSNMR line shapes for CO2 undergoing molecular motions
were modeled via motional simulations (Figure 4). Information on the motional types (e.g.,
wobbling, hopping, swinging, etc.) with their associated angles and
rates can be acquired from these simulations.78 Spectra generated using a threefold (C3) rotation (as described by the angle α) and a twofold (C2) jump (as governed by the angle β) provided
an excellent agreement with the experimental spectra. Both motions
occur at rates that are on the order of magnitude of ca. ≥107 Hz, which is fast on the NMR time scale given that the breadth
of the powder pattern of rigid CO2 is on the order of 104 Hz at 9.4 T.74 Additional simulation
results provided in the Supporting Information (Figure S9) clearly suggest that the observed changes in experimental
spectra as a function of temperature are due to the change in the
motional angles rather than motional rates.

Figure 4 (a) Motional simulations
of the adsorbed CO2 resonance
(dotted black trace), and the corresponding analytical simulation
(solid blue trace) acquired by fitting the VT 13C SSNMR
spectra (Figure 3).
The motional simulations were constructed using a C3 rotation (b, left) and a C2 jump (b, right) for the CO2 dynamics. The angles α
and β govern these two motions, and the corresponding values
are provided in Table S10. Both motions
occur at rates on the order of magnitude of ca. ≥107 Hz in the studied temperature range.

Since SCXRD suggests that the CO2 is adsorbed
at the
framework hydrogen, the SSNMR data thus indicate that the CO2 undergoes a local rotation (or “wobbling”) modeled
by a C3 rotation and a nonlocalized C2 jump between two neighboring framework hydrogens
pointing toward the center of the channel (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Illustration of the (left) wobbling and (right)
hopping motions
displayed by CO2 adsorbed in α-Zn3(HCOO)6. The CO2 wobbles locally upon the hydrogen-based
adsorption site through the angle α and hops between adjacent
adsorption sites located along the crystallographic b axis at an angle β. Carbons are dark gray, oxygens are red,
hydrogens are white, and [ZnO6] units are purple octahedra.
All framework carbons and hydrogens are omitted for clarity except
for H1, H5, and H6 and the corresponding carbons. The red and gray
dashed lines represent C–O bonds between the carbons and [ZnO6] units that connect the top and the bottom of the channels.
These units are also omitted for clarity.

The angles (α and β) defining the C3 and C2 motions also change
with temperature (Table S10), whereas the
motional rates remain the same across the experimental temperature
range (see the Supporting Information for
a more detailed discussion on the motional rates). The temperature
dependencies of the motional angles are consistent with the dynamic
model described above. For example, α, the angle describing
the amplitude of the local (C3) rotation,
gradually climbs from 37.0 to 49.5° when the temperature is raised
from 123 to 293 K. Such change is expected as an increase in temperature
should result in an increase in the amplitude of the local rotation.
However, CO2 displayed a decrease in wobbling and hopping
at temperatures higher than 293 K. Between 293 and 443 K, α
declined slightly from 49.5 to 47.5°. This is consistent with
the proposed NTE effect, which results in a more restricted CO2 wobbling at higher temperatures. The angle β describing
the alignment of CO2 with respect to the channel also dropped
from 47.0 to 40.0° in this temperature range.

1H → 13C CP SSNMR experiments were
also performed to investigate the adsorptive behavior of CO2 loaded in the α-Zn3(HCOO)6 framework.
The CP spectra were acquired at two temperatures, 173 and 293 K, using
various CP contact times (Figure 6). In 1H → 13C CP experiments,
polarization is transferred from 1H nuclei to neighboring 13C nuclei.79 The polarization transfer
is mediated by heteronuclear dipolar interactions, which is sensitive
to 1H–13C internuclear distances as well
as molecular mobility. As a result, stationary 13C nuclei
that are in very close proximity to protons will give strong CP signals
at short contact times. Mobile 13C nuclei and/or 13C nuclei that are far away from protons will require long contact
times to be detected or might not be detectable at all by CP experiments.

Figure 6 Static 13C SSNMR spectra of 13CO2-loaded α-Zn3(HCOO)6 recorded using direct
excitation (red traces) and 1H → 13C
CP (black traces) at (a) 293 and (b) 173 K. The 1H →
CP SSNMR spectra were obtained using various CP contact times (0.5–10
ms). The location of the adsorbed 13CO2 resonance
deduced from the direct-excitation spectrum is highlighted with a
yellow box. The 1H → 13C CP spectra of
the activated framework are also provided for reference (blue traces,
CP contact time = 0.5 ms). All spectra were acquired at 9.4 T.

When a short contact time of 0.5
ms was employed, the CP spectra
of both empty and CO2-loaded MOFs are dominated by the 13C signals from the organic linkers in the framework (Figure 6). This observation
is not unexpected since the framework carbons in α-Zn3(HCOO)6 are covalently bonded to the hydrogens; therefore,
the framework 13C in the H–COO– fragment can give observable CP signals despite being at natural
abundance. At any given temperature, the CP signal due to 13CO2 adsorbed in the MOF was detected at longer CP contact
times (i.e., 1–10 ms), with the CP intensity increasing with
contact time. This is because the 1H–13C dipolar interaction between the adsorbed 13CO2 and framework hydrogens is relatively weak due to the long distances
between the 13CO2 and the linker hydrogens,
and the interaction is further attenuated by the anisotropic CO2 motions. As a result, a longer contact time is needed for
polarization transfer.

Normally, the CP signals for 13CO2 adsorbed
inside MOFs are weaker at higher temperatures than those at lower
temperatures due to an increase in CO2 mobility.39,66 Interestingly, the opposite is observed in the present case: the
CP signal due to the 13CO2 adsorbed in α-Zn3(HCOO)6 is more intense at 293 K than at 173 K
at any given contact time, indicating that the 1H–13C dipolar interaction between adsorbed 13CO2 and framework hydrogens is slightly stronger at higher temperatures.
This result is consistent with the proposed NTE effect as a slight
contraction of the framework at higher temperatures will result in
a slight reduction in the distances between the framework hydrogens
and 13CO2, leading to a stronger CP intensity.
Thus, the 1H → 13C CP experiments not
only are consistent with the fact that the CO2 adsorption
sites are the framework hydrogens, but also support the proposed NTE.

CO Adsorption and Dynamics in α-Zn3(HCOO)6
To examine if the NTE phenomenon observed in the
CO2-loaded α-Zn3(HCOO)6 framework
is guest dependent, carbon monoxide (CO) adsorption in α-Zn3(HCOO)6 was studied via static VT 13C SSNMR spectroscopy. Experiments were performed from 173 to 433
K to encompass the starting point of the NTE observed for CO2-loaded α-Zn3(HCOO)6, and the spectra
are shown in Figure 7. A single powder pattern corresponding to adsorbed CO was detected
within the temperature range of 193–433 K, along with a sharp
isotropic peak corresponding to unbound CO (δiso =
ca. 184 ppm). The changes in the line shape and breadth of the broad
powder patterns indicate that the CO molecules experience molecular
motions inside the MOF. The apparent 13C CS tensor parameters
were extracted from spectral simulations, and the tensor parameters
are temperature-dependent (Table S11).
The apparent Ω varies from 77 to 41 ppm in the studied temperature
range, which is drastically smaller than the Ω of rigid CO (353
ppm).74 Moreover, the Ω and κ
of CO have a different temperature dependence compared to those of
CO2: the Ω and κ of CO adsorbed inside the
MOF exhibit a monotonic decrease with increasing temperature (Figure 8). Since the kinetic
diameter of CO (3.76 Å)80 is larger
than that of CO2 (3.30 Å)80 and closer to the pore size of α-Zn3(HCOO)6 (dpore = 4.44 Å),46 the chemical shift anisotropy powder pattern
of CO should be more sensitive to framework contraction that leads
to reduced CO mobility. The fact that the apparent Ω of CO only
unidirectionally decreases with increasing temperature in the entire
temperature range of 173–433 K implies that the α-Zn3(HCOO)6 framework does not exhibit NTE at high
temperatures when CO is the guest molecule. Guest molecules have also
influenced the thermal expansion behavior of other metal formate frameworks.77,81 For instance, the size of the cations in the [AmineH+][Mn(HCOO)3] MOFs (AmineH+ = [(CH2)3NH2]+ and [(NH2)3C]+)77 and their hydrogen
bonding strength with the host framework81 can both affect the expansion magnitude. In the case of CO- and
CO2-loaded α-Zn3(HCOO)6, our 13C SSNMR results suggest that NTE only occurs for the CO2-loaded MOF in the studied temperature range.

173 to 433 K (Bo = 9.4 T), and (b) the

with asterisks (*). The analytical simulations acquired from 193 to
433 K are given as summation spectra (dotted black trace) constructed
from the free (solid red trace) and adsorbed (solid blue trace) CO
resonances. The 13C CS tensor parameters obtained from
the simulations can be found in Table S11.

(b) κ(13C) of CO2 (open red circles) and
CO (solid black squares) in α-Zn3(HCOO)6 at various temperatures. The vertical dashed line marks the temperature
(ca. 293 K) where the Ω and κ trends begin to reverse
for CO2. The Ω and κ values were obtained from
analytical simulations as shown in Figures 3 and 7. The measured
values can be found in Tables S10 and S11.

To obtain additional information
on the behavior of CO in the MOF,
motional simulations were also performed on the 13CO SSNMR
line shapes, and the results are provided in Figure 9. The adsorbed CO molecules were found to
simultaneously undergo a C3 rotation and
a C2 jump, which are described by the
angles α and β, respectively (Figure 9). These motions occur in the fast motion
regime (ca. on the order of magnitude of ≥107 Hz)
and are analogous to those exhibited by CO2. Since CO and
CO2 generally have the same adsorption sites in MOFs82−87 and CO can also act as a hydrogen bond acceptor,87−91 CO in α-Zn3(HCOO)6 is
likely adsorbed at the hydrogen of the formate linker. 67Zn SSNMR experiments were also conducted, and CO adsorption was found
to have no significant influence on the immediate Zn environments
(Figure S2). Thus, the C3 rotation corresponds to a localized wobbling upon the
hydrogen-based adsorption site, and the C2 jump describes hopping between adjacent adsorption sites located
along the channel (Figure S6). Previous
computational studies showed that both the carbon and oxygen of CO
are capable of hydrogen bonding, but a stronger interaction was observed
for C···H as compared to O···H.88,89 Therefore, CO likely interacts with the hydrogens of α-Zn3(HCOO)6 via the carbon atom. Consistent with the
apparent 13C CS parameters, motional simulation results
also revealed unidirectional trends in α and β as a function
of temperature. α increased from 45.0 to 47.5° and β
climbed from 20.0 to 39.5° when the temperature was raised from
173 to 433 K (Table S11 and Figure S7),
indicating a lack of NTE for the CO-loaded α-Zn3(HCOO)6 framework.

in Table S11.

Comparison of CO2 Dynamics in α-Zn3(HCOO)6 and Other MOFs with Hydrogen-Based Adsorption
Sites
In recent years, we have examined CO2 dynamics
in three types of MOFs where the CO2 molecules are adsorbed
at the framework hydrogen atoms: (i) MIL-53 (M), M = Al, Ga;66 (ii) α-Mg3(HCOO)6;39 and (iii) Al-fumarate.67 In (i) and (iii), the CO2 molecules
are adsorbed at the hydrogens of the bridging hydroxyl groups, whereas
in (ii) the CO2 molecules are adsorbed at the hydrogens
of the formate linkers. The common motion experienced by CO2 in these types of MOFs is the local rotation or wobbling motion.
As mentioned earlier, this motion involves the CO2 molecule
adsorbed at the framework hydrogen wobbling through an angle α
between the longitudinal axis of CO2 and the wobbling axis
(Figure 5). Since α
defines the space that CO2 sweeps through during the rotation,
it may be related to the strength of the interaction between CO2 and hydrogen.40,66 Thus, a stronger O=C=O···H
interaction can result in a smaller wobbling angle. Figure 10 and Table 1 show that the α of CO2 adsorbed
in the MIL-53-based MOFs are remarkably smaller than those in the
formate-based MOFs. This suggests that the hydrogens in the OH groups
of MIL-53 have a stronger acidity compared to the hydrogens in the
H–COO– fragments of α-M3(HCOO)6, resulting in a stronger interaction with CO2. For MIL-53, the α of CO2 in MIL-53 (Al)
is consistently smaller than that in MIL-53 (Ga) at any given temperature,
indicating that the nature of the metal center plays a role in host–guest
interaction.66 However, the situation in
α-M3(HCOO)6 is different. The α
of CO2 in Zn- and Mg-formate are very similar, implying
that the metal does not affect the CO2 motion in a significant
way. The α of CO2 in Al-fumarate MOF is the largest
among the MOFs discussed here. Since Al-fumarate and MIL-53 (Al) have
the same framework topology and metal center, the large difference
in the degree of local rotation obviously results from the nature
of the organic linker.

Figure 10 Wobbling angles (α) of CO2 adsorbed in α-Zn3(HCOO)6 (solid black circles), α-Mg3(HCOO)6 (open
red squares), MIL-53 (Ga) (solid brown triangles), MIL-53 (Al) (open
blue diamonds), and Al-fumarate (green crosses) at various temperatures.
The numerical values are also provided in Table 1. The α-Zn3(HCOO)6 data was obtained from motional simulations (Figure 4). The α-Mg3(HCOO)6, MIL-53, and Al-fumarate data were acquired from refs (39, 66), and (67), respectively.

Conclusions
CO2 adsorption in α-Zn3(HCOO)6 MOF was characterized comprehensively by
SCXRD and SSNMR, and insights
into the behavior of CO2 and its influence on the MOF framework
were attained. Using SCXRD, the positions of the CO2 molecules
inside the MOF channel were accurately determined, and the framework
hydrogens act as adsorption sites. Static VT 13C SSNMR
results reveal that the CO2 molecules undergo anisotropic
motions upon adsorption. Two types of motions were observed via spectral
simulations: a localized wobbling upon the hydrogen-based adsorption
site and a twofold hopping between adjacent sites located along the
porous MOF channel. The dynamic behavior of CO2 in α-Zn3(HCOO)6 was compared with that of other related
MOFs where CO2 is also adsorbed at the framework hydrogen.
Furthermore, the SSNMR results indicate that CO2 adsorption
leads to the NTE of the α-Zn3(HCOO)6 framework
at temperatures ≥293 K. However, this NTE phenomenon was not
observed in CO-loaded α-Zn3(HCOO)6, implying
that the adsorption-induced NTE is guest-dependent. Thus, the thermal
behavior of guest-loaded α-Zn3(HCOO)6 can
potentially be employed as an alternative strategy to tune its gas
adsorption properties.

Methods
Sample Preparation
α-Zn3(HCOO)6 was synthesized based on
a previously reported procedure
with minor modifications.21 Briefly, a
solution containing 25.0 mL of methanol (MeOH, Fisher Chemical, 99.8%),
1.6 mL of formic acid (Alfa Aesar, 97%), and 4.2 mL of trimethylamine
(EMD Millipore Corporation, 99.5%) was added dropwise into a glass
jar containing 25 mL of MeOH and 3.0 g of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (BDH Laboratory Supplies, 98%). The jar was
then sealed with parafilm and small holes were created to allow for
slow evaporation of the MeOH at room temperature. Colorless, transparent
crystals were obtained after 3 days. The crystals were separated by
vacuum filtration, and five methanol washes were performed.

For the SSNMR and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) studies, the MOF
was activated by placing ca. 0.15 g of the as-made sample, which was
ground into a fine powder, into the bottom of an L-shaped glass tube.
The glass tube was then attached to a Schlenk line and heated to 353
K for 18 h under dynamic vacuum (≤1 mbar), resulting in the
“activated” MOF. The activated sample was then loaded
with 13CO2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99% 13C isotope enriched) and/or 13CO (Sigma-Aldrich, 99% 13C isotope enriched) gas. This was accomplished by first introducing
a known amount of the gas into the Schlenk line and then freezing
the gas in the MOF by submerging the glass tube in liquid nitrogen.
A flame-sealing procedure was then performed to remove the glass tube
from the vacuum line. The gas loading level used in this study is
expressed by a molar ratio of guest molecules to Zn. A loading level
of 0.1 guest molecule/Zn was employed for all the 13CO2 and low-temperature (T = 173–293
K) 13CO experiments. A loading level of 0.075 13CO/Zn was employed for the high-temperature (T =
313–433 K) experiments to minimize the intensity of the free
CO SSNMR signal. The 13CO2-loaded α-Zn3(HCOO)6 sample employed for SCXRD analysis was
prepared based on the same activation and gas adsorption procedure
outlined above. However, no grinding was performed, and the activated
MOF was saturated with CO2.

PXRD was performed on
the as-made and activated α-Zn3(HCOO)6, and good agreement was obtained between
the experimental and calculated powder patterns (Figure S8).

X-ray Diffraction
SCXRD analysis
was performed at 120
K using a Bruker-Nonius KappaCCD Apex2 diffractometer with Cu Kα
radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). The sample was mounted on a MiTeGen
polyimide micromount with a small amount of Paratone-N oil. A symmetry
constrained fit of 9044 reflections with 6.12° < 2θ
< 135.18° was employed to determine the unit cell dimensions.
SAINT92 was used for frame integration.
The raw data was then scaled and adsorption corrected via a multiscan
averaging of symmetry-equivalent data using SADABS.93

PXRD patterns were obtained using a Rigaku diffractometer
with Co Kα radiation (λ = 1.7902 Å). 2θ values
were set to range from 5 to 45° with an increment of 0.02°
and a scanning rate of 10° min–1.

13C SSNMR Spectroscopy
All 13C SSNMR experiments
were performed using a Varian Infinity Plus spectrometry
at 9.4 T (Oxford wide-bore magnet; νo(13C) = 100.5 MHz) equipped with a 5 mm HX Varian/Chemagnetics static
probe. Chemical shifts were externally referenced using the methylene
carbon signal from ethanol.

For the VT experiments, temperature
calibration was performed using the 207Pb chemical shift
of Pb(NO3)2.9494 An error of ±2 K is associated with the
temperatures. A Varian VT temperature unit was employed. The spectra
were obtained using a DEPTH-echo pulse sequence with continuous wave
proton decoupling to suppress the probe background signal.66,95 An interpulse delay of 40 μs was used for all experiments,
and the recorded FID were left-shifted to the echo maxima. For the
CO2-loaded samples, spectra were recorded from 123 to 433
K. A π/2 pulse length of 2.35 μs was employed. Apart from
the spectrum recorded at 293 K, which consists of 46 656 scans,
ca. 1024 scans were executed for each spectrum. A recycle delay of
3 s was used for acquisitions at temperatures between 173 and 353
K, and the delay was set to 5 s for all other temperatures. For the
CO-loaded samples, spectra were recorded from 173 to 433 K. The π/2
pulse length was set to 3.30 μs. To obtain a suitable signal-to-noise
ratio, ca. 1000–4600 scans were collected for each spectrum.
A recycle delay of 5 s was used for spectra acquired at 273–353
K, whereas a delay of 7 s was employed for all other temperatures.

Two types of simulation were performed on the static VT 13C SSNMR spectra: analytical simulations and motional simulations.
Analytical simulations were conducted to extract the apparent 13C CS tensor parameters. WSolids96 was employed for the analytical simulations. Motional simulations
were performed to quantitatively examine the guest dynamics. These
simulations were executed using EXPRESS,73 which simulates the effect of Markovian jump dynamics on SSNMR line
shapes. The EXPRESS73 simulations were
performed at 9.4 T using the 13C NMR parameters of rigid
CO2 and CO,74 separately, as
input parameters. Powder averaging was carried out using 2000 powder
increments and the ZCW method. The spectral width was set to 100 kHz,
and 2k points were used in the FID. The motional types, rates, and
angles were systematically altered until agreement was reached between
the simulated and experimental spectra.

The 1H → 13C CP experiments were performed
with continuous wave proton decoupling and echo acquisition (i.e.,
τ1–π–τ2–acq).
Spectra were recorded at 173 and 293 K, and the contact times were
set to 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 8, and 10 ms. A π/2 pulse length of 2.85
μs was used for the empty, activated MOF, whereas a π/2
pulse length of 3.55 μs was executed for the gas-loaded samples.
A recycle delay of 1 s and an interpulse delay (τ1) of 40 μs were used for all experiments. The spectra were
obtained using ca. 3600–5560 scans. The recorded FID were left-shifted to the echo maxima.
