Glycogen is a highly branched glucose
polymer which plays an important
role in glucose storage and the maintenance of blood sugar homeostasis.
The dimeric protein glycogenin can self-glucosylate to act as a primer
for glycogen synthesis, eventually resulting in small (∼20
nm diameter) glycogen β particles with a dimer of glycogenin
at their core. In the liver, glycogen is also found in the form of
α particles: large bound composites of many β particles.
Here, we provide evidence using qualitative and quantitative proteomics
and size-exclusion chromatography from healthy rat, mouse, and human
liver glycogen that glycogenin is the binding agent linking β
particles together into α particles.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Glycogen
is a complex branched polymer of glucose, containing a
small amount of protein,1 with (1→4)-α
linear links and (1→6)-α branch points between glucose
monomers. Biosynthesis of glycogen starts on the dimeric protein glycogenin,
which self-glucosylates at Tyr195 in mouse, rat, and human glycogenin-1
or at Tyr228 in human glycogenin-2 and extends this oligomaltose structure
to ∼10 (1→4)-α-linked glucose units.2,3 This oligomaltose primer is then further extended by glycogen synthase,
which, together with glycogen branching enzyme, facilitates the formation
of a glycogen β particle.4 The liver
contains two types of glycogen: small β particles (∼20–50
nm in diameter), which can be bound together to form large α
particles (up to hundreds of nanometers in diameter), which exhibit
a composite cauliflower-like appearance when viewed under transmission
electron microscopy.5 (Note an unfortunate
confusing point in nomenclature: the terms “α”
and “β” refer both to types of glycosidic linkages
in sugars and to types of glycogen particles; the intended meaning
can readily be inferred from the context.)

In humans, glycogen
is most abundant in the liver, which contains
both α and β particles,5 and
in muscle, which contains β and smaller α particles.5−8 It has been shown that large glycogen α particles release
glucose more slowly than β particles (which are small) in the
presence of degradative enzymes, presumably because of their lower
ratio of surface area to volume.9,10 This suggests that
a high abundance of α particles in the liver serves to allow
a slow release of glucose, as needed during overnight fasting in diurnal
animals, whereas the presence of mainly β and small α
particles in muscle is optimal for the fast glucose release required
for rapid movement.

Glycogen α particles from the liver
of db/db mice, an animal model for type 2 diabetes,
are more molecularly
fragile than those from healthy mice: they readily break apart into
β particles in vitro under conditions that are too mild to break
apart α particles from healthy mice.11,12 This suggests that under appropriate conditions in the liver, diabetic
liver α particles may also break apart easily into small β
particles, which will be more rapidly degraded to glucose.11 This increased fragility of diabetic glycogen
could thus be a contributing factor to the poor blood sugar homeostasis
characteristic of diabetes, suggesting that the binding of small glycogen
β particles together into large glycogen α particles is
compromised in diabetic glycogen.9

It is not known what binds β particles together into α
particles. Various models have been proposed to explain this process.13 It was suggested that disulfide bonding is involved,14,15 although later work suggested that this was not the case.16,17 It has also been suggested that β particles bind together
through any of hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic effects,18 glycosidic linkages,19,20 and a crowding/budding model involving a protein “glue”.21 However, the time evolution of the molecular
size distribution of both glycogen and phytoglycogen during acid hydrolysis,21 and of glycogen particles extracted from formalin-fixed
liver and dissolved at high temperature,10 are both consistent with a noncovalent protein-mediated linkage
(rather than a glycosidic linkage) being the glue binding β
particles into α particles in the liver.

Here, we apply
both qualitative and quantitative mass spectrometry
proteomics and molecular size distribution fractionation and determination
with size-exclusion chromatography (SEC, a type of gel-permeation
chromatography), which separates by molecular size, to investigate
the binding agent in liver glycogen samples from mouse, rat, and human
liver tissues.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Mass Spectrometric Proteomics of Rat Liver
Glycogen
We hypothesized that the glue binding β particles
into α particles is a protein. To identify this protein, we
performed relative quantitative mass spectrometry proteomics of glycogen
from the liver of rats sacrificed ∼8 h after their last meal.
We used size separation by preparative SEC to isolate two separate
fractions enriched with α (larger size fraction) or β
(smaller size fraction) particles (Figure 1b), with the size distribution of unfractionated
samples (from analytical SEC) shown in Figure 1a; the variation between individual samples
in Figure 1a is typical
of that between individual animals, as exemplified elsewhere.12 The SEC data are presented as the SEC weight
distribution w(log Rh), which is the relative weight of molecules with a size (hydrodynamic
radius) Rh. We hypothesized that if α
particles were bound together by a protein, then this protein would
be enriched in the α particle fraction compared with the β
particle fraction. We performed shotgun mass spectrometry proteomics
on replicate SEC-purified glycogen (both α- and β-particle-enriched
fractions), and the only protein to be robustly detected in all fractions
was glycogenin (Supporting Information Table
S1).

maximum of each sample. (b) SEC weight distributions of α-particle-enriched
fractions (red) and β-particle-enriched fractions (blue) normalized

To test if glycogenin was enriched in α particles relative
to β particles, we devised a relative quantitative SWATH-MS
proteomics workflow (Supporting Information Figure S1). We used preparative SEC to purify and fractionate rat
liver glycogen into α- and β-particle-enriched fractions
(no samples were combined), used GOPOD analysis to quantify the glucose-equivalent
concentration of each fraction, and normalized the amount of each
sample to equivalent glucose content. Analytical SEC showed that these
large- and small-size fractions were indeed enriched in α and
β particles, respectively (Figure 1a,b). Because glycogen, being highly branched,
is likely to obstruct diffusion of large molecules such as proteases,
we split each sample into two fractions and treated one sample of
each with α-amylase to digest its glycogen to glucose, thereby
making all of the proteins in the sample accessible. Control samples
without α-amylase treatment would have no change in the accessibility
of proteins. Protein that was measured in samples without α-amylase
digestion was accessible because treatment with trypsin and DTT did
not alter the glycogen molecular size distribution (Figure 1c). The α-amylase treatment
would release any proteins buried inside glycogen particles. All samples
were then protease-digested with the addition of equal amounts of
trypsin, and peptides were measured with SWATH-MS; all proteins are
listed in the Excel files in the Supporting Information. Relative units from the ion currents were used, as we only compared
the relative glycogenin abundances in α- and β-particle-enriched
fractions. This analytical workflow allowed precise comparison of
the relative amount of glycogenin between samples, with normalization
both to tryptic self-digest peptides within a sample and to glucose
concentrations between samples.

Samples of β-particle-enriched
glycogen from rat liver had
relatively low levels of glycogenin, which increased by a small but
statistically significant amount after α-amylase digestion (Figure 1d). This increase
in glycogenin levels was consistent with the generally accepted hypothesis
that glycogen particles are initiated from a noncovalently linked
glycogenin dimer that remains inaccessible to tryptic digestion.22 This “core initiator” glycogenin
would only be accessible after α-amylase digestion. However,
most glycogenin is still accessible to trypsin without amylase digestion,
indicating that there is a large amount of glycogenin attached to,
but not interior to, the glycogen.

We next compared α-
and β-particle-enriched glycogen
fractions. Both with and without α-amylase digestion, fractions
enriched with α particles had significantly more glycogenin
than those enriched in β particles. Detection of glycogenin
in α-particle-enriched fractions was significantly but not substantially
increased after α-amylase digestion, suggesting that glycogenin
was also mainly located on the surface of α particles. These
results (Figure 1d)
confirmed that glycogenin was enriched in α particles relative
to β particles and were thereby consistent with glycogenin being
the glue between β particles.

How might glycogenin act
as both β particle primer and glue?
The enzymatic role of glycogenin as a core initiator of glycogen β
particles is to build a (1→4)-α glucose oligosaccharide
glycosidically linked to glycogenin Y195.23 This activity requires that (1→4)-α glucose oligosaccharide
acceptor substrate and uridine diphosphate (UDP) glucose bind at the
active site of glycogenin. Binding of (1→4)-α glucose
oligosaccharide in the absence of UDP glucose, or with a regulatory
inactive enzyme, would allow dimeric glycogenin to act as a lectin,
noncovalently linking glycogen β particles together into α
particles.

2.2 Mass Spectrometric Proteomics
of Mouse and
Human Liver Glycogen
To explore and support our postulate
of glycogenin being the glue binding β particles together into
α particles, we performed similar analyses of mouse and human
liver glycogen. As with rats, liver glycogen from mice contained both
α and β particles (Figure 2a). Consistent with previous studies,24 human liver glycogen (samples obtained after >8 h of
fasting)
consisted only of α particles (Figure 2b).

Figure 2 Proteomic and SEC analyses of mouse and human
liver glycogen. (a)

humans after SEC separation into two fractions: Frα, α-particle-enriched;
Frβ, β-particle-enriched; and am, pretreated with α-amylase.
Values are mean glycogenin abundance normalized to trypsin abundance.
Error bars show standard deviation. *, P < 0.05.

Qualitative proteomic analyses
were used to identify the proteins
associated with glycogen purified from mouse and human liver samples.
As with our analysis of rat glycogen, only glycogenin was robustly
detected in all samples (Supporting Information Table S1). We identified glycogenin-2, but not glycogenin-1, in
human liver, suggesting that the former is the major form present
in that organ. We next used SWATH-MS to analyze the relative glycogenin
content in α- and β-particle-enriched fractions. Similar
to the result of our analysis of rat glycogen fractions, β-particle-enriched
glycogen from mouse liver had relatively low levels of glycogenin,
and these levels were significantly increased with α-amylase
treatment (Figure 2). Fractions enriched in α particles had higher levels of glycogenin
than β-particle-enriched fractions, either with or without α-amylase
treatment (Figure 2c). The slight increase in glycogenin content in α-particle-enriched
fractions after α-amylase digestion in the mouse samples (Figure 2c) is not statistically
significant but consistent with the majority of glycogenin being surface-accessible,
as with rat glycogen (Figure 1d).

We next used SWATH-MS to investigate the glycogenin
content of
human glycogen, which only contains α particles. This analysis
clearly indicated that the glycogenin content significantly increased
with α-amylase digestion, with a greater change than seen in
the rodent samples (Figure 2d). This indicates that in the human samples, the majority
of the glycogenin was inaccessible to trypsin.

It was, at first,
surprising that we did not identify previously
reported glycogen-associated proteins,25 including glycogen synthase, glycogen phosphorylase, phosphorylase
kinase, and glycogen debranching enzyme. Instead, the only glycogen-associated
protein we robustly identified from rat, mouse, and human liver samples
was glycogenin. This is probably due to the stringent purification
procedure we used to enrich glycogen. Importantly, our purification
strategy was able to maintain intact α and β particles.
This suggests that the additional glycogen-associated proteins previously
observed25 are associated with but not
strongly bound to glycogen and are not required for α-particle
assembly. For example, glycogen debranching enzyme is associated with
glycogen but is not permanently bound to this glucose polymer.25

2.3 Model for α-Particle
Binding
Liver glycogen is present as small β particles
and large α
particles that are agglomerates of β particles. The β
particles are built from an oligomaltose primer extended from a glycogenin
dimer. Using SWATH-MS of liver glycogen from rats, mice, and humans,
we identified glycogenin as the only detectable candidate for a protein
linking β particles together into large α particles (Figures 1 and 2). On the basis of our data, we propose a new model of glycogen
structure in mice, rats, and humans (Figure 3). In this model, β particles are synthesized
from self-glucosylated glycogenin dimer primers. The formation and
fragility of α particles vary over the feeding cycle,12,26 and given that this involves glycogenin as a binder, its concentration
and activity is also likely regulated over this cycle. In addition
to glycogenin being present in the core of β particles, newly
synthesized glycogenin may be nonglucosylated. In our model, this
glycogenin binds to the nonreducing termini of oligomaltose present
on the surface of β particles, which is distinct from the well-understood
covalent attachment of oligomaltose to Y195 of glycogenin.3 Binding of neighboring β particles by many
glycogenin dimers would thus provide a stable binding to form α
particles.

Figure 3 Model for glycogen α-particle assembly. Primer glycogenin
(black) is present at the core of all β particles. Under appropriate
physiological conditions, nonglucosylated glycogenin dimers (red)
noncovalently bind terminal (1→4)-α glucose on the surface
of β particles. This binding links neighboring β particles.
Multiple glycogenin links make glycogen α particles robust.

This proposed mechanism appears
to be conserved in rat, mouse,
and human glycogen, but with some variation in the precise amounts
of glycogenin and in the distribution of α and β particles.
However, the physiological regulation of this process is unclear.
Glycogen α particles are more fragile in db/db mice than in healthy mice,11 and it is
possible that altered glycogenin interactions play a role in this
process.

In this investigation, none of the animals or humans
had symptoms
of diabetes; applying the same methods to diabetic samples will be
the subject of future work.

There is evidence that α particles
can be present in muscle
glycogen (including cardiac muscle),7,8 so although
there are functional and structural differences between muscle and
liver glycogen, some of the findings on liver glycogen from the present
work may also be relevant to muscle glycogen.

3 Conclusions
We have provided evidence consistent with a
model in which the
protein glycogenin is the binding glue that joins β particles
together to form large α particles in liver glycogen in healthy
rats, mice, and humans. This mechanism may provide a novel avenue
for pharmacological interventions to improve glucose control in diabetes
because glycogen α particles are more fragile in db/db mice than in healthy mice.

4 Methods
4.1 Animals
Samples were obtained from
C57BL/6J +/+ female mice (n = 6), Wistar rats (n = 7), and healthy human liver (n = 4),
as described elsewhere.11 Mice were 8 weeks
old when purchased from Hubei Provincial Food and Drug Safety Center
(Hubei, China). Mice and rats were kept in a standard specific pathogen-free
room with a 12 h dark/light cycle (lights on at 7 am), with the temperature
set at 22 ± 1 °C. Animals had ad libitum access to standard
chow (6% energy from fat, 14.3 MJ kg–1, Hubei Provincial
Center for Disease Control and Prevention) and water. All animals
were sedated and humanely euthanized before removal of the liver,
which was then excised rapidly, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and
stored at −80 °C. This study was carried out in strict
accordance with the “Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo
Experiments” (ARRIVE) guidelines. The protocol was approved
by the Huazhong University of Science and Technology Tongji Medical
College Animal Care and Ethics Committee (IORG no. 0003571). For glycogen
obtained from humans, all of whom needed liver surgery, no patients
had diabetes or insulin resistance. Briefly, all patients were fasted
for at least 8 h before surgery, and tissue was taken for further
pathological examination from patients during surgery and was snap-frozen
in liquid nitrogen. This conformed to the ethical guidelines of the
1975 Declaration of Helsinki as reflected in a priori approval by
the Huazhong University of Science and Technology Tongji Medical College
Animal Care and Ethics Committee (IORG no. 0003571). Patients gave
informed written consent as part of their consent to undergo surgery.

4.2 Glycogen Extraction and Purification
Liver
glycogen was prepared and extracted, as previously described.11,27 Briefly, 1.5 g of liver tissue was resuspended in 250 mL of glycogen
isolation buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 50 mM
NaF, and 5 mM sodium pyrophosphate), homogenized, and clarified by
centrifugation at 6000g to obtain crude extracts.
Supernatants were subsequently ultracentrifuged at 370 000g. Pellets were then separated by centrifugation through
a sucrose gradient (37.5 and 75%) at 370 000g to enrich glycogen. Further purification of glycogen followed the
method of Tan et al.28 using preparative
aqueous SEC (as described below) to remove contaminant glycogen-associated
proteins not strongly bound to the glycogen.

4.3 Size-Exclusion
Chromatography
Aqueous
SEC was performed, as previously described.11 Briefly, all glycogen samples were dissolved in SEC eluent (50 mM
NH4NO3 with 0.02% sodium azide) in a thermomixer
at 80 °C overnight. Samples (2.2 mL) with 2 mg/mL total glycogen
were injected manually into an AF 2000 SEC instrument (Postnova Analytics,
Landsberg-Lech, Germany), using a set of preparative columns: SUPREMA
precolumn, 30 and 3000 (Polymer Standards Services, PSS, Mainz, Germany)
in a column oven at 80 °C at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min with refractive
index detection. The 80 °C temperature is required for efficient
solubilization of glycogen. Glycogen α and β particles
remained intact after this treatment, meaning that the logic of our
analytical workflow is robust. These conditions may well result in
loss of less tightly bound proteins, but these are not required for
α-particle formation. Samples were collected at appropriate
elution times to obtain two size-separated samples, one enriched with
α particles and the other with β particles. A 1 mL aliquot
of each fraction was kept and further analyzed by analytical SEC,
to compare the distribution before and after preparative SEC separation,
and the remaining samples were lyophilized and stored at −20
°C. The set of analytical columns comprised a SUPREMA precolumn,
1000 and 10 000 (PSS) in an 80 °C column oven at a flow
rate of 0.3 mL/min. Universal calibration curves for analytical SEC
were obtained using pullulan standards (PSS) with a molecular weight
range of 342–2.35 × 106 Da. SEC data are presented
as the SEC weight distribution w(log Rh), the total mass (not molecular weight) of molecules
as a function of their hydrodynamic radius (size) Rh, which is the SEC separation parameter.

4.4 Glycogen Content Analysis
Lyophilized
glycogen samples from eluents of preparative SEC were dissolved in
250 μL of deionized water, from which an aliquot of 50 μL
was taken for analysis using glucose oxidase/peroxidase reagent (GOPOD,
Megazyme, Ireland). The reaction mixture (500 μL) [5 μL
of amyloglucosidase (Megazyme), 20 μL of glycogen sample, 100
μL of sodium acetate buffer pH 6, and 375 μL of deionized
water] was incubated on a thermomixer at 50 °C for 30 min. A
300 μL aliquot was placed in 1 mL of GOPOD and incubated for
30 min at 50 °C on a thermomixer. The absorbance at 510 nm was
measured with a UV-1700 PharmaSpec UV–vis spectrophotometer
(Shimadzu), and the glycogen content was calculated from a calibration
curve created by reacting a range of concentrations of d-glucose
with GOPOD reagent. All samples were analyzed in triplicate.

4.5 Mass Spectrometry
Samples enriched
in α or β particles were diluted to equal glucose-equivalent
concentrations in a final volume of 200 μL of 100 mM MOPS buffer
pH 7 and separated into two equal aliquots. One microliter of α-amylase
(≥1000 units/mg protein, Sigma-Aldrich, diluted 100×)
was added to one aliquot, and both were incubated at 37 °C for
1 h. DTT (Sigma-Aldrich) at a final concentration of 10 mM and 0.5
μg of trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) were added to each sample and
incubated at 37 °C overnight. The resulting peptide solutions
were then desalted using C18 ZipTips (Millipore).

Peptides were
analyzed by Information Dependent Acquisition and SWATH-MS LC-ESI-MS/MS
using a Prominence nanoLC system (Shimadzu) and a TripleTOF 5600 mass
spectrometer with a NanoSpray III Interface (SCIEX), as previously
described.29,30 Sample injection order was randomized.
Peptides were identified, as described previously,31 using ProteinPilot (SCIEX), searching the UniProt database
with parameters: sample type, identification; cysteine alkylation,
none; instrument, TripleTOF 5600; species, none; ID focus, biological
modifications; enzyme, trypsin; search effort, thorough ID. False
discovery rate analysis using ProteinPilot was performed on all. Peptides
identified with greater than 99% confidence and with a local false
discovery rate of less than 1% were included for further analysis.
The ProteinPilot data were used as ion libraries for SWATH analyses.32 The abundance of peptides and proteins was measured
automatically by PeakView v2.1 software (SCIEX). The accuracy of peak
selection by PeakView was manually confirmed in each sample. Statistical
comparison of the abundance of glycogenin normalized to trypsin (because
the same amount was added to every sample) was performed with MSstats
in R, as previously described.33 The amount
of trypsin used does not affect our quantitative result, as we did
not overload the capacity of the LC column or the MS detector in our
SWATH method. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited
to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository
with the dataset identifier PXD009140 (username: reviewer94902@ebi.ac.uk;
password: UCqxn45T).34
