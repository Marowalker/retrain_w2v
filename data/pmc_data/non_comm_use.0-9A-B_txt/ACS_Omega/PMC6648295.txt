Lattice disorder
has emerged as a novel strategy to realize visible-light
photocatalytic activity, but many existing studies often involved
reduction states simultaneously. Photocatalysts based on only the
lattice disorder but without the reduction states are still quite
lacking and challenging. To this end, we explored a new type of lattice
disorder in terms of the surface atom nonstoichiometry strategy in
BaTiO3. Well-dispersed tetragonal BaTiO3 nanocrystals
with a uniform size (∼20 nm) and cuboid morphology were hydrothermally
synthesized through controlling over t-butylamine
and oleic acid. HRTEM coupled with structural evolution analysis reveals
the existence of a Ti-rich layer on BaTiO3 nanocrystals
with surface atom disorder, which gives an overall Ti/Ba ratio of
1.50:1. This is mainly dominated by the oriented adsorption between
oleic acid and surface Ba2+ of the nucleus during solution
reaction. Such a surface disorder and Ti-rich nonstoichiometry effect
could facilitate the enhanced visible-light absorption with a wavelength
span of 400–700 nm that enables the superior visible-light
photocatalytic property, which is not subject to the reduction states.
This work demonstrates a first white material presenting a new type
of lattice disorder that would be helpful for a wide range of photocatalyst
explorations.

1 Introduction
Solar-driven
photocatalyst has attracted considerable attention
because it provides a relatively simple and environment-friendly route
that enables directly harvesting and converting sunlight into chemical
energy.1 To explore the high-performance
photocatalysts, great endeavors have been devoted, on the one hand,
to improve the capability of absorbing visible/infrared light, and
on the other, to suppress the combination of photogenerated electrons
and holes. For nearly all the wide-gap semiconductors with an intrinsic
band gap of Eg > 3.0 eV, for example,
TiO2,2 ZnO,3 MTiO3 (M = Ba/Sr/Ca),4 MTaO3 (M = K/Na),5 etc., chemical
modifications through the controllable doping of metal and/or nonmetal
ions to generate donor/acceptor levels in the band gap2,6 or noble metals and heterocompound loading to facilitate charge
transfer and separation7−9 are necessary. However, the diversity in the origin
of mid-gap energy levels, for example, reduced states, interstitial
states, F+ centers, vacancies, defect coupling, etc.,10−13 makes no consensus understanding in the photocatalytic mechanisms.
More seriously, these effects, due to the associated trapping centers
and mid-levels, usually lead to rapid photogenerated charge carrier
recombination that undermines the photocatalytic performances.

Recently, a conceptually different approach, that is, hydrogenation
that introduced surface disorder in TiO2 nanophase, was
achieved by Chen et al.14 with exploration
of black titania. This “black” only refers to the lattice
disorder in a material with yielding mid-gap states whose energy distributions
differ from that of a single defect in a crystal. The fascinating
black concept, with showing quite promising potentials, has been widely
expanded and adopted for synthesizing various black visible-light
photocatalysts, for example, black TixOy,15−17 Nb2O5,18 BiVO4,19 BaTiOx or related
hybrids,20 etc. As a matter of fact, these
newly developed black photocatalytic materials are more or less involved
with the reduction states, somewhat similar to the case of Ti3+ self-doped TiO2;21−23 this obviously not coincided
exactly with the original lattice disorder induced black but might
be subject to the catalytic roles that the reduction states mainly
play in. Consequently, challenging questions are still open. For instance,
what is another new type of a visible-light catalyst with only the
lattice disorder but without the reduction states? Further, is it
possible to explore a white material with visible-light activity only
based on the lattice disorder?

In this work, a new type of surface
disorder, that is, surface
atom nonstoichiometry, was proposed in order to gain affirmative answers
as schematically seen in Figure 1a. Assuming that the disorder/amorphous structure with
unsaturated surface atoms enables offering the larger surface area
and more active sites than that of the crystalline type, the surface
band gap of the electronic state may become diffused to narrow the
gap in terms of the localized band tail for the visible-light response.
This assumption has been proven very recently in binary semiconductors,
for example, (Mo,W)(S3,Sex),24−26 with existing structural amorphous states, which showed higher photocatalytic
efficiency than their crystalline states. Herein, we selected a typical
wide-gap semiconductor, BaTiO3, as a prototype oxide in
order to construct the surface disorder and Ti-rich nonstoichiometry
for achieving the outstanding visible-light photocatalytic property.

2 Results and Discussion
Single-phase BaTiO3 nanocrystals were synthesized by
a tailored hydrothermal method, where NaOH and t-butylamine
were used to control over the phase, size, and morphology, while oleic
acid was utilized for the purpose of the surface disorder and nonstoichiometry
tuning. The synthesized particles crystallize in perovskite-structured
BaTiO3 without any other possible impurities like BaCO3 or TiO2, indicating the pure-phase nature of BaTiO3 (XRD in Figure 2a). Further confirmed by TEM (Figure 1c,d), as-synthesized BaTiO3 has a well-defined
cuboid morphology and uniform size of around 25 nm. Careful HRTEM
observations reveal that these BaTiO3 nanoparticles were
well crystallized in the inner core as seen in the clear lattice fringes
with a spacing of 0.41 nm, but strikingly, their surfaces were capped
by an amorphous or atomic disorder thin layer. This layer has a thickness
of about 2–3 nm as highlighted in Figure 1e (arrows). Therefore, the surface disorder
was achieved in BaTiO3 nanocrystals, as expected.

°C.

To identify the formation mechanism
of surface disorder, Fourier
transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum of BaTiO3 nanocrystals
was measured (Figure 1b). The infrared absorptions at the low-wavenumber region, that is,
600–380 cm–1, are the Ti–O vibration
characteristics in the BaTiO3 lattice.27 Except for the absorbed H2O at 3418 and 1626
cm–1 that are assigned to O–H stretching
vibration (υ) and O–H deformation vibration (δ),
respectively, surface coordination groups were observed additionally.
Peaks at 2923 and 2853 cm–1 correspond to the C–H
stretching mode of methyl and methylene groups within oleic acid molecules.
Two absorption bands of νas(COO–) at 1525 cm–1 and νs(COO–) at 1375 cm–1 suggest the existence
of acetate groups bonded to Ba atoms as a bridging ligand.28 These observations indicate that the oleic acid
molecules are responsible for the formation of the surface disorder
in BaTiO3 nanocrystals, as schematically proposed in Figure 1a. The six-coordinated
Ti precursor, acting as a sort of Ti-based octahedron monomer, can
easily condense by vertex connections to capture the Ba species, for
example, Ba2+ or [Ba(OH)]+, to form BaTiO3 directly.29 The carboxylic side
of oleic acid molecules would bond to exposed Ba2+ within
the crystalline surface preferentially, while the other side of the
stretched carbon chains spread around the nucleus, due to the steric
hindrance effect of their long hydrophobic tails, would impede the
Ba species to effectively diffuse toward the nucleus’ surface.
As a result of the Ba deficiency, the Ti-rich surface disorder layer
forms.

Whereas the surface amorphous/disorder layer was clearly
presented
for BaTiO3 nanocrystals, what are the nature of this disordered
surface and the crystalline core? Raman spectroscopy was first performed
to determine the phase structure and space group of present BaTiO3 through discernible phonon modes. As shown in Figure 2a, these Raman peaks rightly
correspond to the phonon modes of the tetragonal phase of BaTiO3 (space group P4mm), with
eight Raman modes that are described by 3A1[(TO)+(LO)]+4E[(TO)+(LO)]+B1.30 Two broad bands situated at
260 and 521 cm–1 are assigned to A1(TO)
and [E(TO)+A1(TO)] modes, respectively, and E(TO+LO) and/or
B1 modes at 305 cm–1 were observed to
further confirm the tetragonal phase for present BaTiO3 nanocrystals.31 Another band centered
at 720 cm–1, also characterized in tetragonal BaTiO3, is related to the highest frequency longitudinal optical
mode (LO) of the A1 symmetry of TiO6 octahedra.32

With respect to the characteristics, for
example, compositions
and structures, of the surface amorphous layer, high-temperature annealing
was utilized to crystallize the BaTiO3 nanocrystals, which
enables quantitative analysis through structural evolution and chemical
composition determinations. As shown in Figure 2b, the BaTiO3 sample after sintering
at 500 °C does not exhibit any differences to the as-prepared
one, indicating that such a disorder layer is quite stable. Sintering
at 800 °C gives rise to, in addition to tetragonal BaTiO3, a new phase, that is, monoclinic BaTi5O11 (space group P21/n).
XRD structural refinement was further performed to determine this
phase and ratio by a least-squares method using the GSAS program.33 As seen in Figure 2c, well refinement with a fit parameter of wR = 10.006% and a flat difference curve confirms
highly satisfactory reliability, which yields a molar ratio of 86.14:13.86
for tetragonal BaTiO3 to monoclinic BaTi5O11. This implies that the original molar ratio of Ti/Ba in
as-prepared BaTiO3 apparently deviates from the standard
stoichiometry, which instead is calculated to be 1.55(±0.04):1.
Further sintering at higher temperatures, for example, 1100 °C,
to allow complete crystallization produces a new phase transition,
from which the resulting XRD consists of tetragonal BaTiO3 and monoclinic BaTi2O5 (space group C2/m). Structural refinement gives a 1.48(±0.02):1
molar ratio of Ti/Ba, consistent with the above result. Obviously,
the excessive Ti stems from the surface layer, that is, such a surface
disordered layer is dominated by Ti-rich nonstoichiometry. It thus
concludes that surface-disordered and Ti-rich BaTiO3 (SurTi-BaTiO3) nanocrystals, for the first time, were achieved. To gain
a comparative conclusion, a mixture of commercial BaTiO3 and TiO2 with a similar refinement ratio, that is, RBaTiO3/RTiO2 = 1:0.5, was sintered at high temperatures (Figure S1). This gives a similar phase transition
behavior that an additional Ti-rich phase, that is, BaTi2O5, forms with the dominated BaTiO3 phase when
sintering at 1100 °C, again suggesting the Ti-rich surface for
the as-synthesized BaTiO3 nanocrystals.

The present
disorder and Ti excess in SurTi-BaTiO3,
due to having an altered materials’ surface, may have significant
influences on the optical bands and electronic structures. UV–vis
diffuse spectroscopy was thus performed (Figure 3a) for these purposes. In order to reach
a clearer comparison, commercial BaTiO3 was also involved,
which is characterized similarly in the tetragonal phase (XRD and
Raman in Figure S2). It is striking that
the SurTi-BaTiO3 nanocrystals demonstrate the apparent
absorption in the entire visible-light region with a tail prolonging
to around 700 nm, sharply distinct from that of the commercial BaTiO3 we measured (Figure 3a) or the BaTiO3 nanoparticles and bulks previously
reported.34,35 For these latter cases, there is no absorption
intensity beyond a wavelength of approximately 400 nm because BaTiO3 is typically a direct wide-gap semiconductor with an optical
band gap of approximately 3.2 eV. Regardless of inducing visible-light
absorption, the surface disorder does not alter the band gap (Eg) for SurTi-BaTiO3 nanocrystals,
which is calculated to be 3.26 eV (Figure 3a, inset) using the Kubelka–Munk function,36 quite close to that of commercial BaTiO3. However, the enhanced visible-light absorption for present
SurTi-BaTiO3 is neither related to (i) the quantum confinement
and/or size effects as SurTi-BaTiO3 has large enough particle
scales of over 20 nm nor (ii) the reduced states such as the existence
of Ti3+, which was often involved in the black materials.
It is especially noted that SurTi-BaTiO3 should be reduction
state-free as revealed by XPS measurement (Figure 3c), which presents quite symmetrical Ti 2p
profiles without any Ti3+ detected.37 Moreover, it demonstrates the white color, similar to the
commercial one as illustrated in Figure 3b. Instead, such a difference could only
be attributed to the Ti-rich nonstoichiometry within the surface disorder.
As a consequence of covering the absorption energy range of 3.2–2.1
eV, present SurTi-BaTiO3 is expected to be promising in
the visible-light photocatalytic property.

BaTiO3 and (c) XPS spectrum of as-prepared BaTiO3 nanocrystals.

The photocatalytic performance
of surface-disordered and Ti-rich
BaTiO3 nanocrystals is evaluated by measuring the decomposition
of RhB under visible-light irradiation using a 500 W Xe lamp (λ
> 450 nm). Compared with the commercial BaTiO3 nanoparticles,
which are visible-light photocatalytic inert, the surface-disordered
and Ti-rich BaTiO3 nanocrystals present the outstanding
visible-light photocatalytic activity. As clearly seen, the RhB dye
(concentration CRhB = 10 ppm) can be decomposed
almost in only 15 min, but it does not undergo any decomposition for
both blank and commercial samples (Figure 4a). With regard to the detailed degradation,
the maximum absorption peak of the RhB dye blueshifts from 554 to
498 nm (Figure S3), indicating an N-deethylation
process with the transformation of RhB to Rh (rhodamine) during RhB
degradation.38 The decolorization kinetics
for both samples obeys the Langmuir–Hinshelwood model,39,40 which could be simplified to pseudo-first relation with respect
to the photodegradation rates expressed as follows 1  where C0 is the
initial concentration of the RhB dye, C is the concentration
of the RhB dye at the irradiation time t, and k is the mass-related constant that is determined by an
apparent rate constant (kapp). According
to the fitting slope by the pseudo-first-order rate (Figure 4b), kapp and R2 are calculated (Table 1), for example, SurTi-BaTiO3 has a quite large kapp of 1.20
× 10–1 min–1, orders higher
than that of commercial BaTiO3. The activity factor k (k = kapp/m) for SurTi-BaTiO3 is thus calculated
to be 2.4 min–1·g–1, which
is much larger than those previously reported for oxides,4,39,41,42 exhibiting the superior photodegradation efficiency.

commercial BaTiO3	2.37 × 10–3	0.942	
SurTi-BaTiO3	1.20 × 10–1	0.995	
It is especially noted that no other changes in the
crystal phases
and charge states (Figures S4 and S5) happen
after photocatalysis, which implies a process of only photoproduced
charges and subsequent separation other than the surface chemical
or redox reactions. As a consequence, the SurTi-BaTiO3 nanocrystals
demonstrate excellent photocatalytic stability. As shown in Figure 4c, the RhB degradation
efficiency could be well maintained after five times of cycling test.
We noted that a slight decline in degradation efficiency is due to
the SurTi-BaTiO3 nanocrystal loss during recycling. This
again indicates the superior photocatalytic performance and, most
importantly, the intrinsic photocatalytic nature for the present surface-disordered
and Ti-rich BaTiO3 nanocrystals.

As stoichiometric
BaTiO3 is visible-light photocatalytically
inert because of its large band gap of 3.24 eV, the disordered and
Ti-rich surface layer for SurTi-BaTiO3 nanocrystals should
be responsible for the superior photocatalytic property. This is steadily
supported by the fact that SurTi-BaTiO3 possesses relatively
strong visible-light absorption with an energy span of 3.2–2.1
eV (Figure 3a), which
apparently stems from the surface contributions, forming a BaTiO3@SurTi-BaTiO3 structure. This thus gives rise to
a photocatalytic mechanism like “core–shell”
as presented in Figure 4d. The surface disorder/amorphous structure in SurTi-BaTiO3 behaves somewhat like loose and porous structures to facilitate
the dye adsorption process and possesses more active sites offered
by a greater number of unsaturated atoms on their surfaces compared
to the crystalline structure; meanwhile, the narrower band gap induced
by the localized band tail and gap states of the electronic state
within the surface disorder layer also plays a significant role in
the visible-light response. The photogenerated charge carriers only
happen in the surface layer, which then migrate to the outmost surface
of SurTi-BaTiO3 nanocrystals where the redox reaction is
triggered with the surface absorption species such as OH– and O2 to generate active radicals, for example, O2·– and OH· within near aqueous solution.43,44 These active radicals,
like those previously reported, enable breaking the molecular groups
of RhB to the final decomposition effect.

3 Conclusions
In summary, well-dispersed tetragonal BaTiO3 nanocrystals
with a uniform size and cuboid morphology were synthesized through
controlling over t-butylamine and oleic acid. Strikingly,
the nanocrystals show, for the first time, the surface disorder that
is featured in the Ti-rich nonstoichiometry. Such a surface disorder
effect could improve the solar absorption with a wavelength span of
400–700 nm, which results in the superior visible-light catalytic
property. This work demonstrates a first white material exhibiting
the visible-light photocatalytic performance. Therefore, the proposed
new mechanism, that is, the surface lattice disorder that is not involved
in the reduction states, would be quite promising in photocatalyst
explorations for many wide-gap materials.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Sample Preparations
Surface-disordered
and Ti-rich BaTiO3 nanocrystals were synthesized by a hydrothermal
method. Typically, 0.7887 g of Ba(OH)2·8H2O was dissolved in 50 mL of deionized water, which was followed by
adding 1.21 mL of bis(ammonium lactate) titanium dihydroxide (TALH)
(50 wt % aqueous solution) under magnetic stirring to form a white
suspension. A certain amount of 5 M NaOH aqueous solution to tune
the pH to around 13.0 and t-butylamine with its ratio
to Ba2+ of 8:1 were added into the above suspension to
control over the phase, size, and morphology, while oleic acid was
utilized for the purpose of the surface disorder and nonstoichiometry
tailoring. The as-prepared solution was transferred to a Teflon-lined
autoclave (100 mL) for the hydrothermal reactions that were carried
out at 220 °C for 24 h. After the reaction, white precipitates
formed, which were subsequently filtered, washed thoroughly with diluted
HCl solution, deionized water, and ethanol, and further dried at 60
°C to obtain the final SurTi-BaTiO3 nanocrystals.

For comparison purposes, the commercial BaTiO3 (99.99%)
used in this work was purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical
Technology Co., Ltd. The XRD pattern and room-temperature Raman spectrum
are shown in Figure S2. Commercial TiO2 (anatase, 99.99%) from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology
Co., Ltd. was used to conduct the sintering experiments.

4.2 Characterizations
The phase purity
and crystallinity of the as-prepared samples were examined by X-ray
diffraction (XRD) (Rigaku SmartLab SE, Cu Kα radiation, λ
= 0.15406 nm). Raman spectra were collected on a confocal Raman microscope
(Renishaw inVia) with an excitation line of 514.5 nm at room temperature.
The particle size and morphology of the samples were characterized
by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEOL, JEM-2100). The infrared
spectra of the samples were measured on a Fourier transform IR spectrophotometer
(Thermo Fisher Nicolet iS10). The optical diffuse reflectance spectra
were recorded on a UV–vis spectrometer (Perkin Elmer Lambda
650S). The XPS spectrum was carried out using an X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (Thermo Fisher Scientific K-Alpha+, mono Al Kα radiation).

4.3 Photocatalytic
Studies
The photocatalytic
activity of the as-synthesized SurTi-BaTiO3 nanocrystals
was evaluated through decomposing the Rhodamine B (RhB) dye. The blank
and commercially stoichiometric BaTiO3 samples were used
for comparison purposes. Specifically, 50 mg of the (as-synthesized
and stoichiometric) samples were put into a quartz reactor with 50
mL of 10 ppm (10 mg/L) RhB solution. This reactor was first kept in
a dark environment for 10 h under magnetic stirring to reach a dark
adsorption–desorption equilibrium. Then, a visible-light source
(λ > 450 nm) with a 500 W xenon long-arc lamp was exposed
to
the central cold trap of the reactor to irradiate the samples. During
irradiation, 4 mL of solution was taken out from the reactor at an
interval time of 3 min, which was centrifuged to obtain a clear solution
with the residual RhB dye for absorption spectroscopic measurement.
The absorption characteristic of the centrifuged solution was measured
on a UV–vis spectrometer (Perkin Elmer Lambda 650S), which
was used to monitor the degradation process and evaluate the photocatalytic
performances.
