Water-soluble pillar[6]arene (WP6)
was used to solubilize camptothecin
family antitumor drugs. In the presence of WP6, the solubility of
camptothecin (CPT) and 10-hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) was enhanced
by 380 and 40 times, respectively. The solubility enhancement is proved
to be the result of the host–guest encapsulation by WP6. WP6
has a low cytotoxicity against normal MC 3T3-E1 cells, whereas the
bioactivity of CPT and HCPT is substantially improved as a result
of the solubility enhancement.

1 Introduction
Discovered
in 1966, 20-(S)-camptothecin (CPT)
and its derivatives constitute a family of important antitumor drugs.1 CPT shows powerful antitumor activity by targeting
DNA topoisomerase I (TOP I).2 However,
CPT suffers from two major limitations: (1) CPT is sparingly soluble
in water, limiting its clinical applications via intravenous injection;
(2) the biologically active form of CPT (lactone) rapidly undergoes
a ring-opening reaction and converts to the biologically inactive
form (carboxylate) under neutral conditions (Figure 1a).3 CPT derivatives
with improved solubility in water have been developed, including the
clinically approved antitumor drugs topotecan and irinotecan (Figure 1b).4,5 Liposomes,6 inorganic nanoparticles,7 hydrogels,8 and prodrug
conjugates9 have been developed to formulate
and deliver CPT. To achieve the full potential of CPT for cancer treatment,
new delivery methods are highly desirable to solubilize this hydrophobic
antitumor drug.

Pillar[n]arenes
(PA[n]s, n = 5–10) are a
type of macrocyclic hosts with a
unique pillar-shaped architecture.10 Since
2008, the excellent host–guest recognition ability of PA[n]s has attracted great interests.11−18 Water-soluble PA[n]s with either anionic (carboxylate)19 or cationic (amine)20 modifications have been used for drug delivery,21 material assembly,22 and antibiotic
applications.23 Among these water-soluble
PA[n]s, carboxylated PA[6] (WP6, Figure 1c) is an important macrocyclic
host with a large cavity (7.7 Å),24 excellent host–guest recognition ability, and relatively
simple synthesis.25 Recent study also demonstrated
the satisfactory biocompatibility of WP6.26 There are reports of cyclodextrin and cucurbituril-based molecular
containers used to formulate and solubilize hydrophobic pharmaceuticals.27−31 The clinical success of β-cyclodextrin-based Captisol proves
that solubility enhancement by host–guest encapsulation has
practical use.32,33 Water-soluble PA[n]s have outstanding recognition property and can be easily functionalized
for “smart” drug delivery. We envision that WP6 and
other water-soluble PA[n]s may be ideal candidates
for solubility enhancement applications.

Herein, we report the
use of WP6 for the solubility and bioactivity
enhancement of CPT and 10-hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT). In this article,
we study the WP6-assisted solubility improvement of CPT and HCPT.
The recognition behavior of WP6 toward CPT family drugs is investigated.
Finally, the bioactivity of WP6-solubilized CPT and HCPT, as well
as the biocompatibility of WP6, are tested in vitro.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Design and Synthesis
WP6 was chosen
as the drug carrier for two reasons: (1) the cavity is large enough
to accommodate CPT and its derivatives; (2) PA[6], the precursor to
synthesize WP6, is relatively easy to prepare. WP6 was synthesized
according to the literary procedures (Figure 1c).25 Starting
from inexpensive materials, the condensation reaction of 1,4-diethyoxybenzene
and paraformaldehyde delivered PA[6] with a yield of 15%. After removing
ethoxy groups with BBr3, phenolic hydroxyl groups were
substituted with methyl esters. Finally, the hydrolysis reaction converted
esters to carboxylates. The treatment with NaOH yielded WP6 as a sodium
carboxylate. The synthesis of WP6 is relatively simple, with low cost,
which renders the large-scale preparation and pharmaceutical applications
possible. WP6 is highly soluble in water. Its solubility was measured
to be 33 mM in NaD2PO4 buffer (10 mM, pD = 7.4).
Its excellent solubility in water enables WP6 to be used for solubility
enhancement of hydrophobic pharmaceuticals.

2.2 Solubility
Enhancement
The solubility
enhancement assay was performed with poorly soluble drugs CPT and
HCPT. Although CPT is barely soluble (5 μM) in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS), HCPT is slightly more soluble (29 μM). To determine
the solubility enhancement, a known concentration of WP6 was stirred
with excess solid drug for 3 h in NaD2PO4 buffer
(10 mM, pD 7.4). The excess insoluble drug was removed with centrifugation.
The concentration of the drug in the supernatant was determined by 1H NMR integration of drug resonances versus 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic
acid, subsequently added as internal reference (Figures S1–S12). The solubility enhancement assay was
performed in triplicate. Phase solubility diagrams are shown in Figure 2. WP6 substantially
improves the solubility of both drugs (380 times for CPT and 40 times
for HCPT). The solubility reaches 1.9 mM for CPT and 1.2 mM for HCPT
in the presence of 10 mM WP6, which is soluble enough for dosing via
intravenous injection. Both solubility phase diagrams are referred
to as AP type plots, signifying the presence of a higher
order complex (e.g. (WP6)2-CPT).33

2.3 Host–Guest Chemistry
We investigated
the host–guest interaction between WP6 and CPT family pharmaceuticals.
The intrinsic solubility of CPT and HCPT is too low to determine the
host–guest chemistry at neutral pH. Instead, a basic solvent
of 0.1 M NaOD in D2O was used to improve the solubility
of CPT (Figure S13). The 1H
NMR spectrum recorded for equal molarities of WP6 and CPT shows a
broadening of CPT aromatic resonances, which indicates the host–guest
interaction between WP6 and CPT (carboxylate form). To investigate
the encapsulation under neutral condition, topotecan (TPT), a water-soluble
and clinically approved CPT family drug, was used to study its binding
with WP6 at pH 7.4. Figure 3a shows the 1H NMR spectra recorded for TPT, WP6,
and mixtures of WP6 and TPT (1:2, 1:1, and 1:0.5). Aromatic proton
a and methyl proton g undergo significant upfield shifts in the presence
of WP6, which indicates the encapsulation of TPT. The resonances of
upfield-shifted aromatic protons are broadened in the presence of
excess TPT, without the observation of free topotecan resonances,
demonstrating a fast exchange on the chemical shift time scale. TPT
has a (CH3)2NCH2– substituent,
which enhances its electrostatic interaction with WP6. Parts of the
TPT aromatic system are encapsulated inside the cavity, which implicates
that hydrophobicity and π–π stacking are also the
causes of encapsulation. Unlike TPT, there is no electrostatic interaction
between WP6 and CPT at basic pH. We believe that the driving force
for the host–guest interaction between WP6 and CPT (carboxylate
form) under basic condition is hydrophobicity and π–π
stacking.

Figure 3 (a) 1H NMR spectra recorded for (1) WP6, (2) topotecan,
and mixtures of WP6 and topotecan, with ratios of 1:2 (3), 1:1 (4),
and 1:0.5 (5) (400 MHz, room temperature, 10 mM NaD2PO4, pD 7.4, [WP6] = 1 mM). (b) The molecular structure of dyes
used in this paper, and (c) UV–vis spectra from the titration
of proflavine (10 μM) with WP6 (0 – 72 μM) at pH
7.4 (PBS).

The stability of the complex formed
by WP6 and the pharmaceutical
is critical for the clinical use. We evaluated the complex stability
by measuring the binding constant Ka.
Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used to mimic the neutral physiological
environment (pH 7.4). Because CPT and HCPT are poorly soluble in water,
direct 1H NMR titration could not be used to determine
the value of Ka. Instead, we used the
indicator displacement assay.34 We first
measured the value of Ka for the complex
of WP6 and dye. Two dyes, proflavine and neutral red, were used in
the study (Figure 3b). The value of Ka for the complex of
WP6 and dye was determined by direct UV–vis titration (Figures 3c and S15a). The existence of the isosbestic point
shows a 1:1 binding stoichiometry for both dyes. We also used the
Job plot to confirm that the binding stoichiometry for proflavine
is 1:1 (Figure S16). The Ka value for the complex of WP6 and proflavine/neutral
red was calculated to be (1.4 ± 0.1) × 105 M–1 and (1.3 ± 0.1) × 105 M–1, respectively (Figures S14b and S15b). We then used the indicator displacement assay by fluorescence
or UV–vis spectroscopy to determine the Ka value for the complex of WP6 and CPT family antitumor drugs.
The Ka value was determined to be (8.4
± 1.0) × 106 M–1 for CPT, (1.2
± 0.2) × 105 M–1 for HCPT,
and (1.3 ± 0.1) × 104 M–1 for
TPT (Figures S17–S19). The Ka value for the complex of WP6 and CPT/HCPT
falls in the range of 105–107 M–1 in PBS, which indicates that WP6 could form a stable complex with
CPT/HCPT during injection.

2.4 In Vitro Study
We then investigated
the bioactivity of WP6-solubilized CPT and HCPT in vitro. It is crucial
for the WP6 carrier to be biocompatible for any drug delivery application.
The cytocompatibility of WP6 was checked in a normal cell line MC
3T3-E1 using a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, and the results are presented
in Figure S20. Very little cytotoxicity
was observed for the WP6 systems with various concentrations. Even
if the concentration of WP6 was as high as 500 μM, the cell
viability was still above 90%. Hence, WP6 has very good biocompatibility
and shows great potential for biomedical applications.

To determine
the antitumor activity of solubilized drugs in the WP6 systems, the
cytotoxicity of WP6 systems containing CPT or HCPT against a tumor
cell line Hela was also examined, and the results are shown in Figure 4. Because of the
good biocompatibility of WP6 itself, the treatment of WP6 systems
alone with Hela cells had no significant effect on the cell viability.
In sharp contrast, both the CPT-loaded WP6 system and the HCPT-loaded
WP6 system exhibited an increased cytotoxicity with drug concentration.
As shown in Figure 4, with a drug concentration of 5 μM, the viability of Hela
cells reached 10 and 40% when treated with CPT-loaded WP6 and HCPT-loaded
WP6, respectively. Calculated by the SPSS method, the half maximal
inhibitory concentration (IC50) of the CPT-loaded WP6 system
was 0.1 μM, whereas that of the HCPT-loaded WP6 system was 0.5
μM. We also treated Hela cells with CPT or HCPT alone and calculated
the IC50 to be 0.8 and 1.3 μM, respectively. It is
obvious that the IC50 of WP6-solubilized CPT or HCPT is
lower compared to that of the free drug. We also determined the influence
of WP6 encapsulation toward bioactivity of the water-soluble antitumor
drug TPT (Figure S21). The bioactivity
of WP6-encapsulated TPT was slightly higher compared to that of the
free drug at 5 μM.

Figure 4 (a) In vitro cytotoxicity of WP6, CPT-loaded
WP6, and free CPT
against Hela cells as a function of CPT concentration. (b) In vitro
cytotoxicity of WP6, HCPT-loaded WP6, and free HCPT against Hela cells
as a function of HCPT concentration. The two values in the horizontal
coordinate indicate the concentration of the drug (front) and WP6
(back), respectively. The blank control with culture medium only was
set as 100% cell viability. Each point represents the mean ±
SD; n = 6. Significant differences between the groups
of free HCPT and HCPT-loaded WP6 determined by the Student’s t test are marked as the following criterion: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.

The cell assays indicate
that WP6 is a biocompatible drug carrier
to be used in vitro. By enhancing the solubility of CPT/HCPT, WP6
is able to improve the cytotoxicity of the drugs. Because CPT/HCPT
alone has very limited solubility in PBS, they are not soluble enough
to be dosed via intravenous injection. With the solubility enhancement
of WP6, CPT/HCPT can reach a solubility of more than 1 mM and may
be used for chemotherapy in vivo.

3 Conclusions
In summary, water-soluble pillar[6]arene (WP6) dramatically enhances
the solubility of CPT and HCPT. The study of host–guest chemistry
confirms that WP6 could bind CPT family antitumor drugs with a stable
complex formed between WP6 and CPT/HCPT. The bioactivity of CPT and
HCPT was substantially improved with WP6 in vitro. The drug carrier
WP6 was proven to have a low cytotoxicity and high biocompatibility.
Our work demonstrates that WP6 and other water-soluble pillar[n]arenes have a great potential to be used for the formulation
of poorly soluble drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).

4 Experimental Section
4.1 General Experimental
All reagents
and solvents were purchased from commercial suppliers and were used
without further purification. WP6 was prepared according to the procedure
in the literature.25,35 Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis)
spectroscopy was performed on a Cary 100 Agilent UV–vis spectrometer.
Fluorescence spectra were measured on a Shimadzu RF-1536 spectrometer.
NMR spectra were recorded on an AVANCE III 400 spectrometer. Cell
viability was measured on a Biotek ELx808 Microplate Reader.

4.2 Intrinsic Solubility of WP6
Excess
WP6 was added into NaD2PO4 buffer (10 mM, pD
= 7.4). The suspension was stirred at room temperature for 12 h. The
excess solid was removed with centrifugation. The concentration of
WP6 in the supernatant was determined with 1H NMR spectroscopy
by comparing the integral of a known concentration of 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic
acid as the internal reference. The solubility of WP6 was calculated
to be 33 mM.

4.3 Intrinsic Solubility of
CPT/HCPT
Excess CPT was added into PBS. The suspension was
stirred at room
temperature for 6 h. The excess solid was removed with centrifugation.
The concentration of CPT was determined with UV–vis spectroscopy
on the basis of a standard curve plotted with the UV–vis absorbance
of CPT. The solubility of CPT was measured to be 5 μM.

Excess HCPT was added into NaD2PO4 buffer (10
mM, pD = 7.4). The suspension was stirred at room temperature for
3 h. The excess solid was removed with centrifugation. The concentration
of HCPT in the supernatant was determined with 1H NMR spectroscopy
by comparing the integral of a known concentration of 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic
acid as internal reference. The solubility of HCPT was measured to
be 29 μM.

4.4 Concentration of WP6-Solubilized
Pharmaceutics
Excess CPT/HCPT was added into a solution of
WP6 in NaD2PO4 (10 mM, pD = 7.4) with a known
concentration. The
suspension was stirred at room temperature for 3 h. The excess solid
was removed with centrifugation. The concentration of CPT/HCPT in
the supernatant was determined with 1H NMR spectroscopy
by comparing the integral with a known concentration of 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic
acid as the internal reference. Each data point was performed in triplicate
to calculate the deviation.

4.5 In Vitro Cytotoxicity of
WP6 against Normal
MC 3T3-E1 Cells
To determine the biocompatibility of WP6,
the cytotoxicity of WP6 against normal MC 3T3-E1 was quantitatively
detected by a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. MC 3T3-E1 cells were
seeded into 96-well plates at 4 × 103/well. Cells
were first incubated in the atmosphere containing 0.5% CO2 at 37 °C for 12 h before drug treatment. Next, the medium from
the cells was aspirated and fresh medium (200 μL/well) containing
WP6 at varying concentrations (5 × 10–3–5
× 102 μM) was added as feed. After 24 h of incubation,
the medium of each well was replaced with 200 μL of fresh medium
containing 20 μL of CCK-8 solution. Finally, the OD value of
each well was detected at a wavelength of 450 nm by a Microplate Reader
(Biotek ELx808) after 3 h of incubation. The relative cell viability
was calculated to quantify the cytotoxicity, and the control group
without treatment of any material except culture medium added was
defined as 100% viability.

4.6 In Vitro Cytotoxicity of
Combinations between
WP6 and CPT/HCPT against Hela Cancer Cells
The cytotoxicity
of solubilized CPT/HCPT in the WP6 systems against the Hela cancer
cell line was examined by a CCK-8 assay. Hela cells were seeded in
96-plate well (4 × 103/well) and cultured for 12 h.
Then, the cells were treated with fresh medium (200 μL/well)
containing free CPT/HCPT, pure WP6, and CPT/HCPT-loaded WP6 systems
at varying drug concentrations (for CPT/HCPT and CPT/HCPT loaded in
WP6: 5 × 10–4–5 × 101 μM; for WP6 carrier: 5 × 10–3–5
× 102 μM) for another 24 h. The detecting and
analytical methods were the same as above-mentioned methods. The concentration
of the test agent in 50% cell viability was defined as IC50, and the SPSS software (IBM SPSS Statistics 21.0.0.0) was used to
calculate the IC50 value.

4.7 Statistical
Analysis
All of the cellular
experiment results were expressed by their mean ± SD (standard
deviation). Comparisons between groups were analyzed by Student’s t test, and a p value less than 0.05 was
considered as the criterion of a statistically significant difference.
