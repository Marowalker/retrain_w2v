Bedaquiline (BDQ) is the most critical
pharmaceutical in the world
for treating multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Despite it being highly effective, BDQ asymmetric synthesis remains
a challenge. Herein, the influence of chiral bases, namely, bis(1-phenylethyl)amine,
bisoxazoline, and sparteine on the diastereoselective lithiation reaction
to obtain BDQ was investigated. The highest diastereoselective ratio
(dr) emerged as 90:10 from the (+)-bis[(R)-1-phenylethyl]
lithium amide. This is a significant improvement from the 50:50 dr
achieved from the commercial synthesis. Thereafter, the desired (90:10 RS, SR) diastereomeric mixture was easily
isolated via a gravity column and subjected to chiral supercritical
fluid chromatography (SFC) to access the desired enantiomer (1R, 2S)-BDQ. The advantages of this procedure
are enhanced diastereoselection as well as a greener, faster way to
achieve excellent enantioseparation (up to 1.0 g scale).

Introduction
Tuberculosis (TB) is
a global endemic cause of disability and death.1 It is estimated that up to one-third of the world’s
population has been infected with TB, more commonly in areas where
crowded housing, poverty, poor general health, malnutrition, HIV coinfection,
and other social disruptions are present.2 It is mainly caused by an infection with Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis). M. tuberculosis has developed multidrug
resistance (MDR) toward first-line TB treatment due to mutation of
the pathogen upon patient discontinuation or an incorrect drug prescription.3 MDR-TB regimens are more intensive, prolonged,
expensive, and often unsuccessful. Therefore, there is an urgent calling
for development of new agents that may shorten the duration of therapy,
have minimal interaction with antiretroviral drugs,4 have simple dosage schedules, improve adherence, decrease
the risk of relapse while reducing mortality, and potentially control
the MDR-TB epidemic.5

In 2005, Andries
and co-workers reported the first MDR antituberculosis
drug known as TMC 2076 at the time and
now referred to as bedaquiline (BDQ) fumarate marketed under the trade
name Sirturo.7 It was given fast approval
by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in late 2012 under the accelerated
approval program.8 It emerged as the first
antituberculosis-specific drug in 40 years; it inhibits the proton
pump for M. tuberculosis’s
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase representing a novel mechanism
of action for pulmonary drug-resistant tuberculosis.9 BDQ has a bactericidal and sterilizing activity against M. tuberculosis by hindering the ATP generation whereby
it targets the central region of a c subunit of the ATP synthase enzyme.
It has proven to be a significant step toward providing a shorter
and more tolerable regimen for patients infected with drug-resistant
tuberculosis.10 BDQ appears on the World
Health Organization’s List of Essential Medicines and is only
commercially available in a handful of countries.11 The cost of BDQ (per 6-month treatment) ranges from US$30,000
to US$900, from high- to low-income countries, respectively.12

On a molecular level, BDQ (Figure 1) contains two stereogenic
centers; therefore, in the
absence of an external chiral medium, its chemical synthesis will
lead to four isomers, which are distributed in a mixture of two pairs
of diastereoisomers, namely, (RS, SR) and (RR, SS). The (1R, 2S) stereoisomer is the most active isomer against
tuberculosis and is known as BDQ. Andries et al. performed the experiments
to test the activity of all four stereoisomers against multidrug-resistant
strains of M. tuberculosis. They reported
the concentration that causes 90% inhibition to bacterial growth (IC90) for each isomer as well as that of the mixture of the two
isomers. The (R,S) and (S,R) gave values of 0.03 and 8.8 μg/mL,
respectively, and when combined, produced a value of 1.8 μg/mL,
as shown in Figure 1. The (R,R) and (S,S) isomers gave IC90 values of 4.4 and
8.8 μg/mL, respectively, while the mixture yielded a value of
4.4 μg/mL.13 These results demonstrated
the need to optimally isolate the (R,S) isomer to exclusively treat M. tuberculosis.

Figure 1 Four isomers of bedaquiline with the most active isomer, as depicted
with its antimycobacterial activity (IC90) against M. tuberculosis.13

The initial synthesis conducted by Johnson &
Johnson reported
the one-step deprotonation of the starting quinoline (1) with LDA. They accomplished the separation of the desired diastereomer
from the mixture by taking advantage of the uniqueness of the diastereomer’s
solubility in acetic acid/THF (tetrahydrofuran). Later, they separated
the mixture of two enantiomers using a chiral resolution agent. However,
after separation, three-quarters of the final products were discarded,
half was the undesired diastereomer, and a quarter was the undesired
enantiomer.14 The overall yield obtained
was merely 1%. This method resulted in low yields, poor enantioselectivity,
and low efficiency, which opened the door for possible improvement.
To date, there are a few synthetic routes published for the preparation
of BDQ.15 The asymmetric routes include
the work done by Saga et al. that developed a convergent asymmetric
synthesis. Apart from the complexity of their method and the use of
expensive reagents, their synthesis involved 12 linear steps from
commercially available compounds with an overall yield of 5%.16 Later, Chandrasekhar and co-workers reported
the asymmetric synthesis of the desired isomer. This method took the
linear tactic in 10 steps with an overall yield of 12%.17 The most likely (Janssen Pharmaceutical) industrial
process relies on a one-step lithiation reaction (using LDA as the
base) after which chiral resolution (with binaphthol phosphate) is
being utilized to isolate the desired isomer for its large-scale production;18 however, drawbacks still include the loss of
the desired diastereomer in the first step (due to the absence of
chiral environment) and low overall yields. The diastereomer (RS, SR) is separated from the crude mixture
of diastereomers (50:50) by recrystallization. Subsequently, the diastereomer
(RS, SR) is then converted into
its diastereomeric salt with a chiral resolution agent from which
the desired stereoisomer (R, S)
is isolated by recrystallization following neutralization of the salt
to afford the free drug as a single enantiomer. The chiral resolution
adds two more steps to the already low-yielding one-pot procedure.

Herein, we report the influence of replacing the nonchiral base
LDA in the lithiation step to form BDQ with chiral bases, namely,
bis-phenylethylamine,19−21 bisoxazoline,22,23 and sparteine24−26 with the intention of improving the yield of the desired diastereoisomer
(RS, SR) without increasing the
number of synthetic steps. Thereafter, we report the optimization
and isolation of the desired enantiomer (R,S) from the mixture using chiral supercritical fluid chromatography
(SFC).27

Nowadays, SFC has become
a widely used technique on both analytical
and preparative scales due to its advantages over traditional high-performance
liquid chromatography.28 A remarkably faster
separation speed, lower viscosity that allows higher flow rates, and
high diffusivity, which result in an overall better efficiency and
reduction of using organic solvents (as much as 90% less), are achieved
with the use of inexpensive CO2. These “green”
aspects coupled to the ease of sample collection make SFC an attractive
option to be used to assist in accessing pharmaceutically important
molecules27 such as BDQ, especially when
the purification step could substitute some of the expensive steps
within the synthetic route.

Results and Discussion
First, we
conducted the synthesis of BDQ using lithium diisopropylamide
(LDA) as a base as per the original procedure (Scheme 1).14 This route
used 5:5 equiv of n-BuLi/diisopropylamine in THF,
the deprotonation step took place for 30 min and the reaction with
the electrophile for 3 h at −78 °C.

(2) To Obtain Bedaquiline (3)
This method formed the product mixture with
a 50:50 diastereomeric
ratio (dr) of (RS, SR) and (RR, SS), with approximately 10 and 17%
yield, respectively, which was in keeping with the original report.14

We aimed to substitute the diisopropylamine
with a chiral base,
that is, 4a-b, 5a-b, and 6a-b (typically reported to be used in asymmetric deprotonation
lithiation) as represented in Figure 2 in hope of increasing the dr of the desired isomer.

Figure 2 Chiral
bases utilized in the lithiation step.

Following the conditions from the LDA reaction, the single enantiomer 4a(19) as the chiral base was evaluated
using 5:5 equiv of n-BuLi/4a. After
careful examination of the results obtained during the lithiation
step, we discovered that the chiral complex behaved very differently
to the nonchiral LDA complex. Also, further meticulous care had to
be taken to prevent the complex from being quenched with regard to
the introduction of moisture from the solvent, apparatus setup, glassware
used, and the concentration of the n-BuLi that had
to be consistently checked. Although the reaction took place, there
was no desired product formation; instead, the abstraction of the
bromine atom took place from the commercially available quinoline 1 as well as the product 3 (refer to Scheme 1), which could have
been a result of the high reactivity of the n-BuLi
complex. After further optimization, the n-BuLi/4a concentration of 3:2 provided a 5% conversion of 1 to 3. Further lowering the amount of the Li
complex resulted in no reaction at all. (The following optimization
results can be found in the Supporting Information.)

Next, we investigated the temperature of the deprotonation
step
(of quinoline 1) since the literature reports this step
to play a crucial role in the reactivity of certain substrates.20,24 The temperature was increased within the range of −60 to
0 °C to determine the optimal energy required for the chiral
complex to deprotonate the substrate (1). The highest
conversion was observed at −20 °C, which was around 15%
conversion. The temperature of 0 °C resulted in a quite messy
reaction indicating several undesirable reactions taking place. At
this point, we considered using solvents such as toluene, diethyl
ether, cumene, and hexane as they have been reported as typical solvents
to conduct lithiation.29,30 However, the limitation was the
insolubility of the reagents irrespective of concentration or temperature.
Thus, THF remained as the only option to conduct further experiments.

Thereafter, the deprotonation time was optimized (from 15 to 120
min) using the same chiral base 4a to investigate the
possibility of obtaining a higher % conversion and/or a better dr.
The deprotonation time of 60 min resulted in the highest % conversion
of 33% even though the dr obtained was still 50:50. The dr was measured
by integration of the chiral proton (H6) where 5.89 ppm (desired)
and 5.73 ppm (undesired) were determined from the crude 1H NMR spectrum.

Previous studies have indicated that the selectivity
of the chiral
Li complex, when using base 4a-b for deprotonation,
can be influenced by the formation of mixed aggregates between LiCl,
formed by the reaction of the respective lithium complex with 1, and 4a-b, which is more reactive
and selective than the monomer or dimer of 4a-b.31 Simpkins and Bunn reported a substantial
improvement in the stereochemistry of chiral base-mediated deprotonation
reaction products with the presence of added LiCl.32 There are several reports that generate the 4a-b.LiCl mixed heterodimeric Li-amide/LiCl complexes, that is, either
from the direct addition of LiCl to 4a-b or the addition
of BuLi to the 4a-b hydrochloride salt.21,31,33

Thus, in the next experiment, 4a was treated first
with LiCl (2 equiv) to generate 4a·LiCl followed
by the sequential addition of 1 and 2. In
this case, the dr of the product changed to 45:55. Thereafter, the
deprotonation of 1 was carried out with the in situ-generated 4a·LiCl that was obtained by treatment of the 4a hydrochloride salt with 3 equiv of n-BuLi. This
reaction yielded a crude mixture with 30:70 dr in which 30% was the
desired (RS, SR) and 70% was the
(RR, SS) undesired diastereomer.

In the hope of reversing the dr to favor the formation of the desired
diastereomer, we then conducted an experiment with the opposite enantiomer
of 4a, that is, using n-BuLi/4b. To our delight, this led to 90% of the desired (RS, SR) and 10% of the undesired (RR, SS) diastereomer. At this point, we still tried
to improve the conversion with longer reaction times. However, this
increased the formation of the undesired diastereomer. A possible
reason could be that the mixed 4b–LiCl complex
is equilibrated toward a less active complex when the lithium alkoxide
product is increasing in concentration, for example, by competing
for LiCl from the Li-amide or forming less reactive mixed Li-amide/Li-alkoxide
complexes.34 This proved to be a limitation
in the reaction from going to completion. The summary of these modifications
and dr obtained are shown in Table 1.

for 60 min; thereafter, the reaction proceeded at −78 °C.
All optimization reactions were carried out on a 0.15 mmol scale unless
stated otherwise.

c Addition of n-BuLi
to 4a·HCl salt.

Subsequently, we focused our attempts on using the
other chiral
bases, that is, sparteine and bisoxazoline using our optimized conditions.
With chiral complexes made from 5a and 5b, we again encountered the formation of 250 m/z during the deprotonation, which indicated abstraction
of bromine taking place from 1. Further attempts to optimize
the reaction conditions were endeavored such as modifications in temperatures,
chiral base equivalents, and the use of s-BuLi instead
of n-BuLi as well as the reaction times. However,
the optimal deprotonation still did not occur. For 6a and 6b, no reaction took place due to the failure of
the deprotonation step to occur, as only the starting material was
observed.

With the optimal conditions in hand, with n-BuLi/4b·LiCl (Table 1, entry 5), the reaction was carried out
on a 1 g scale. The
mixture of the (RS, SR) and (RR, SS) diastereomers (39% yield, 330 mg,
dr of 90:10) thus obtained was then separated by a gravity column
of which the desired diastereomer (86%, 285 mg, (RS, SR)) and undesired diastereomer (10%, 35 mg, (RR, SS)) were obtained. The isolated desired
diastereomer was then subjected to chromatographic separation using
a compact Sepiatec Prep basic SFC system fitted with a chiral analytical
column for separation of the enantiomers. The simplified handling
of this instrument proved to be very convenient when using the stacked
injection feature. The enantiomers were successfully eluted under
isocratic conditions using stacked injections to afford the desired
enantiomer (1R, 2S; 130 mg) and
the undesired enantiomer (1S, 2R; 142 mg). The overall reaction yield was 13% and >99 ee. The
BDQ
obtained from this study was further used to investigate its central
nervous system penetration in an animal model.35 During the preparation of this manuscript, we came across
a 2017 patent written in Chinese having applied a similar concept
to make BDQ. They made use of a chiral amino alcohol as the chiral
inducer for the lithiation step in the presence of a mixture of both
LDA and n-BuLi.36 The
obtained ratio of the diastereomers (RS, SR) and (RR, SS) was 80:20;
thereafter, they made use of a chiral resolution agent to obtain the
desired enantiomer in a 15% overall yield. This makes the study herein
only one of the two reports that have improved the ratio of the diastereomers
for the synthesis of this important drug.

Conclusions
We
have achieved a highly diastereoselective synthesis of BDQ using
the optimized lithiation conditions with the chiral ligand bis(1-phenylethyl)amine 4b. The use of 3:2 equiv of n-BuLi/4b afforded
the dr of 90:10 for (RS, SR) and
(RR, SS) diastereomers, respectively,
with 33% yield, compared to the dr of 50:50 obtained from syntheses
in the absence of a chiral environment. This suggests that such a
method can be utilized for the diastereoselective synthesis of BDQ.
Thereafter, the desired diastereomer (RS, SR) was easily isolated via a gravity SiO2 column
and subjected to chiral SFC separation to obtain the desired (1R, 2S) enantiomer with an overall reaction
yield of 13%; this is similar to other attempts reported to advance
the BDQ asymmetric synthesis. To this end, the reaction turnover requires
improvement without compromising the diastereoselectivity, which poses
a challenge. There is also a gap for industrial chemists to further
address practical isolation procedures toward the larger-scale synthesis
of BDQ. Nevertheless, the advantages of this technique are improved
diastereoselection and a greener and faster way to achieve excellent
enantioseparation (scalable) to obtain BDQ in the laboratory.

Experimental
Section
Optimized Procedure Using 4b·HCl
The salt was made according to the reported procedure.31 To a solution of 4b·HCl salt
(1.6 g, 2 equiv) in THF (20.0 mL), 5.61 mL of 1.6 M n-BuLi in hexane (9.2 mmol, 3 equiv) was added dropwise at −78
°C under the flow of argon. The solution was stirred for 10 min,
warmed up to room temperature, and stirred further for 1 h. The clear
yellow solution was recooled to −78 °C and again stirred
for 1 h to form a pinkish solution of the chiral base complex.

Lithiation
Step
A solution of 1 (1.0 g,
1 equiv) in THF (10.0 mL) was slowly added to an in situ-formed chiral
base from above and stirred at −20 °C. After exactly 1
h, a solution of 2 (0.83 g, 1.2 equiv) in THF (10.0 mL)
was added dropwise over 20 min via a cannula, and the resulting solution
was stirred at −78 °C for 3 h. The reaction was warmed
up to room temperature, quenched with aqueous NaCl (20.0 mL), and
then extracted with EtOAc (5× 10.0 mL). The organic layer was
dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated in vacuo to
give a clear yellow oil. The crude product was further purified by
flash column chromatography (1:1 EtOAc/hexane). The Rf values were
0.30 for the undesired (35 mg) and 0.44 for the desired (285 mg) diastereomer
obtained as white solids. The (RS, SR) was then subjected to semipreparative SFC for separation, which
provided the desired enantiomer (1R,2S) (130 mg).
