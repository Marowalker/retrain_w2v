In view of potential agricultural
activity of sarisan (isolated
from many plants or easily synthesized from sesamol, another biorenewable
natural product) analogues, many research studies on the application
of these biorenewable and abundant natural resources have been proceeded.
A series of novel sarisan analogues containing N-phenylpyrazole
were synthesized and evaluated for their insecticidal activity against
a crop-threatening insect pest, Mythimna separata Walker. Meanwhile, an iodine-mediated oxidative intramolecular C–N
bond formation methodology has been established for the one-pot synthesis
of these N-phenylpyrazole-containing sarisan analogues.
This practical one-pot methodology is metal-free and requires no separation
of the less stable intermediate hydrazones. In addition, it was found
that compounds 8l–r exhibited more promising insecticidal
activity with the final mortality rates (FMRs) >62.1%, when compared
with the positive control toosendanin. Especially, compound 8r with 2-fluoro-4-bromophenyl showed the most potent insecticidal
activity, the FMR of which was 79.3%. On the basis of this, some interesting
results of structure–activity relationships were also discussed.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Mythimna separata Walker (oriental
armyworm), also known as the Northern armyworm, is a typical crop-threatening
pest, which is mainly distributed in China, India, Korea, and also
other countries.1,2 The larvae of this insect pest
can cause a great deal of damage to many cereal crops such as wheat,
maize, and rice during its seasonal outbreaks.3,4 Although
lots of synthetic chemical pesticides have been used to control insect
pest outbreaks and also have played a crucial role in modern agriculture,
the overuse and abuse of synthetic chemical pesticides over the years
lead to considerable concern for pest resistance, pesticide residue,
and other side effects on human health.5−7 Thus, there are urgent
needs to discover new promising alternatives from the sustainable
natural bioresources to effectively and selectively control the insect
pest.

Sarisan (I, Figure 1), possessing a piperonyl moiety, is a biorenewable
manoligan and isolated from many species of plants, such as Ligusticum mutellina,8Piper solmsianum C. DC,9Piper sarmentosum,10Saururus chinensis,11 and Beilschmiedia miersii.12 Its isomer, myristicin (II, Figure 1), is a
well-known synergist for carbamates, pyrethroids, and other pesticides,
of which synergistic activity is similar to commercial synergist piperonyl
butoxide12,13 (V, Figure 1). Sarisan also shows a variety of biological
activities including antimicrobial activity,8 anti-septic activity,12 and psychopharmacologic
effect,14 especially its pesticidal activity
against armyworms15 and different kinds
of mosquitoes.16 In addition, pyrazole
derivatives are one of the most interesting class of N-heterocyclic compounds that have remarkable biological activities
in the areas of both pharmacological and agricultural activities,
such as anticancer,17,18 antitubercular,19 antimicrobial,20 analgesic,21 insecticidal,22 acaricidal,23 herbicidal activities,24 and so forth. The well-known fipronil (III, Figure 1) is a representative
pesticide containing the N-phenylpyrazole moiety
for control of insects on wheat, corn, and other cereal crops, which
was exploited by Rhône-Poulenc Inc., in 1987 and showed prominent
insecticidal activity.25 In 1996, Bayer
CropScience AG discovered another well-known insecticide ethiprole
(IV, Figure 1), which belongs to fipronil derivative.26 The difference between them is that only trifluoromethylsulfinyl
of fipronil was substituted by ethylsulfinyl. What is more, as far
as we know, little attention has been paid to the introduction of
the active substructure N-phenylpyrazole at the active
position (C-3, 6, 1′, 2′, or 3′ position) of
sarisan. Inspired by these interesting results and also in prolongation
of our research on the discovery of new biorenewable natural product-based
pesticides, in this paper, we designed and took advantage of iodine
as a mediator to smoothly synthesize a series of N-phenylpyrazole sarisan analogues by one-pot methodology. Besides,
we have evaluated the insecticidal activity of all the title compounds
against M. separata and discussed the
structure–activity relationships (SARs).

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis
As shown in Scheme 1, compounds 2–4 and the key intermediate 3-formylsarisan
(5) were acquired
as per our reported procedures.27 We used
sesamol as the starting material to synthesize sarisan analogues instead
of utilizing sarisan separated from plants, which not only can save
economic costs but also can protect plant resources. First, sesamol
was reacted with allylbromide and K2CO3 to afford
allyl ether 2 in 93% yield, followed by Claisen rearrangement
to afford phenol 3. Second, compound 3 was
reacted with SnCl4, paraformaldehyde, and 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene
to afford 4 in 58% yield, and then methylation of compound 4 with CH3I–K2CO3 in
acetone smoothly afforded 3-formylsarisan (5) in 87%
yield. Finally, compound 6 was prepared by the condensation
of compound 5 with acetophenone in KOH/MeOH/H2O and subsequently reacted with the corresponding hydrazine hydrochlorides 7a–t in EtOH to afford the target N-phenylpyrazole sarisan analogues 8a–t via I2-mediated oxidative cyclization. The structures of all target
compounds were characterized through 1H/13C
NMR, infrared (IR) spectroscopy, and melting point (mp).

Scheme 1 Synthetic
Route for the Preparation of N-Phenylpyrazole
Sarisan Analogues 8a–t
However, above all, considering the synthesis of compound 8a as the template (Table 1), the reaction conditions for the synthesis of N-phenylpyrazole sarisan analogues via I2-mediated
oxidative cyclization and different solvents were investigated. Initially,
we investigated the amount of iodine for the one-pot synthesis of 8a in EtOH at reflux. The results indicated that a mixture
of 6 and 7a in the presence of molecular
iodine (2.0 equiv) was the best reaction condition and gave 8a in 89% yield. To further optimize the reaction conditions,
we screened two commonly used solvents [N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)]
and found that this reaction did not proceed well in DMF/DMSO at 80
°C in the presence of 2.0 equiv of I2. Especially,
when DMSO was used as the solvent, only a very small amount of 8a was formed in 7% yield. With the optimal one-pot reaction
conditions (1.0 equiv of 6, 2.0 equiv of 7a, and 2.0 equiv of iodine in ethanol at refluxing temperature) in
hand, we continued to optimize the reaction conditions by using two-step
condensation. At first, compound 6 was condensed with 7a in ethanol at reflux to form the intermediate hydrazone 6a. After the first-step condensation was complete, compound 6a was separated from the reaction system, redissolved in
EtOH, treated with 2.0 equiv of I2, and then heated to
reflux, which also provided the desired compound 8a in
75% yield. In addition, a plausible mechanism for the formation of
these N-phenylpyrazole sarisan analogues 8a–t is proposed. As shown in Scheme 2, the oxidative iodination of hydrazone 6a–t produces iodide intermediates A–T. Subsequently,
intermediates A′–T′ are formed via
an SN2′-type cyclization of compounds A–T, with the formation of a new C–N bond. Finally, the deprotonation
of compounds A′–T′ affords the target N-phenylpyrazole sarisan analogues 8a–t.

2.2 Insecticidal Activity
As shown in Table 2, the insecticidal
activity of compounds I and 8a–t against M. separata Walker was evaluated as the final mortality
rates (FMRs) at 1 mg mL–1. Toosendanin, a commercial
insecticide derived from Melia azedarach, was used as the positive control. We used corn leaves treated with
acetone alone as a blank control. Among all the tested samples, compounds 8c and 8e showed equivalent insecticidal activity
to the positive control toosendanin with the FMR = 51.7%, which was
higher than the parent compound I with the FMR = 44.8%.
Compounds 8b and 8l–r exhibited more
potent insecticidal activity than toosendanin, and their FMRs were
all higher than 51.7%. Especially, compound 8r showed
excellent insecticidal activity with the FMR = 79.3%, which was 27.6%
higher than that of toosendanin. In addition, we found that the corresponding
FMRs of 33 days were generally higher than those of 20 and 10 days,
which indicated that these title compounds showed delayed insecticidal
activity.28 Administration of the target
compounds to the larvae of M. separata resulted in an array of developmental abnormalities, affecting growth,
molting, and metamorphosis. For example, as shown in Figure 2, because of feeding too much
of compound-treated leaves within the first 48 h, some larvae died
with the symptoms of blackened, wrinkled, and dehydrated bodies. This
phenomenon may be due to the effects of the N-phenylpyrazole
sarisan analogues on nutritional or digestive interference.29,30 In the second stage of pupation, many pupae could not molt into
normal pupae and then died (Figure 3). Similarly, during the last stage of the emergence
period, many malformed moths were observed with shrunk, short, or
immature wings and dead toward the end (Figure 4). The appearance of these malformed pupae
and moths suggested that these compounds might disrupt the endocrine
control of molting.31,32 This experimental phenomenon
was different from traditionally synthetic pesticides, such as organophosphates,
organochlorine pesticides, and so forth, which often kill most of
the insect pests within a few hours33 This
symptom indicated that the effect of the title compounds could cause
toxicity to the treated larvae as they suffered from ecdysial stasis
and inhibition of development, resulting in the suppression of larval–pupal
ecdysis and adult emergence. In this way, these N-phenylpyrazole sarisan analogues can affect reproduction, reducing
egg production and disrupting endocrine system.34,35 On the other hand, to make further investigation of this phenomenon,
we analyzed the percentages of FMRs of the representative compounds 8l–r and toosendanin at three different growth stages
of M. separata (Figure 5). We found that more than half of dead M. separata due to compounds 8l–r and toosendanin were at the larval period. This result could further
demonstrate that the administration of the target compounds to the
treated insect pests mainly inhibit larval–pupal ecdysis, which
resulted in the death of most of the insects during pupation.

Finally,
we also have discovered some interesting results of SARs
of the tested compounds. The introduction of N-(fluorophenyl)pyrazole
at the C-3 position of sarisan could lead to more potent compounds
than those possessing chlorophenyl, bromophenyl, and electron-donating
groups on the phenyl ring [e.g., FMRs: 8b (55.2%), 8e (51.7%) versus 8d (44.8%), 8f (44.8%), 8g (44.8%), 8h (34.5%), and 8k (37.9%)]. Interestingly, we found that the introduction
of polyhalogenated phenylpyrazole at the C-3 position of sarisan could
lead to more promising analogues than monohalogenated phenylpyrazole,
except for compound 8t. For example, the FMRs of 8l (R = 3,4-difluorophenyl), 8m (R = 3,4-dichlorophenyl), 8n (R = 2,4-dichlorophenyl), 8o (R = 3,5-difluorophenyl), 8p (R = 2-chloro-4-fluorophenyl), 8q (R = 2-chloro-5-fluorophenyl),
and 8r (R = 2-fluoro-4-bromophenyl) were all higher than
62.1%. Especially, the introduction of N-(2-fluoro-4-bromophenyl)pyrazole
at the C-3 position of sarisan exhibited the most potent insecticidal
activity.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
a series of novel N-phenylpyrazole
sarisan analogues were prepared and their insecticidal activities
were evaluated against a crop-threatening agricultural insect pest, M. separata Walker. Among all the target compounds,
compounds 8l–r exhibited more promising insecticidal
activity with their FMRs higher than 62.1%, when compared with the
positive control toosendanin. Especially, compound 8r with 2-fluoro-4-bromophenyl showed the most potent insecticidal
activity, whose FMR was 79.3%. On the other hand, we have established
an efficient methodology for the synthesis of N-phenylpyrazole
sarisan analogues through iodine-mediated oxidative intramolecular
C–N bond formation. This practical one-pot methodology is metal-free
and requires no separation of the less stable intermediates hydrazones.
Their SARs indicated that introduction of N-(fluorophenyl)pyrazole
or polyhalogenated phenylpyrazole at the C-3 position of sarisan could
lead to more potent compounds, especially introduction of N-(2-fluoro-4-bromo-phenyl)pyrazole. These promising results
are of importance to the application of sarisan analogues as biorenewable
pesticidal agents in crop protection.

were obtained from Macklin Biochemical Inc. Analytical thin-layer
chromatography (TLC) and preparative TLC (PTLC) were performed by
silica gel plates using silica gel GF254 (Qingdao Haiyang
Chemical Co., Ltd., Qingdao, China). Other reagents were of analytical
grade and purchased from Innochem Co., Ltd. and KeLong Chemical Reagent
Co., Ltd. Anhydrous solvents were purified and dried in terms of standard
procedures. The mps were recorded on a digital mp instrument (Beijing
Tech Instrument Co., Ltd.) and were uncorrected. IR spectra were detected
as dry films (KBr) on a PE-1710 Fourier-transform-IR spectrometer
(PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The 1H/13C
NMR data were recorded on a Bruker Avance (400/100 MHz) NMR spectrometer
(Bruker, Bremerhaven, Germany) using CDCl3 as the solvent
and tetramethylsilane as the internal standard. In addition, compounds 2–5 were prepared using the same method as our previous

4.5 Biological Assay
The insecticidal
activity of compounds I and 8a–t against M. separata was evaluated by the leaf-dipping method
in line with the previously reported method.36,37 Thirty pre-third-instar larvae of the same size and level of health
(10 larvae per group) were chosen as the tested pests for each compound.
Acetone solutions of compounds I and 8a–t and toosendanin (used as a positive control) were prepared at the
concentration of 1 mg mL–1. Fresh corn leaves were
cut into leaf disks (1 × 1 cm2), dipped into the sample
solution for 3 s, then taken out, and dried in RT. The larvae of tested
groups were fed with compound-coated leaves, whereas the larvae of
blank control group (CK) were fed with acetone-treated leaves alone.
Several treated leaf disks were kept in each dish. Once the treated
leaves were consumed, the corresponding ones were added to the dish.
After 48 h, the larvae were treated with untreated fresh leaves and
observed until the adult emergence (temperature: 25 ± 2 °C;
relative humidity: 65–80%; and photoperiod: (light/dark) =
12/12 h). The corrected mortality rate values of the tested compounds
were calculated by the following formula: corrected mortality rate
(%) = (T – C) × 100/(1
– C), where T is the mortality
rate of the tested samples and C is the mortality
rate of CK.
