A single platform
for gene and protein expression studies is proposed
to pursue rapid diagnostics. A common method to synthesize gold (Au)
nanoclusters on both DNA and protein template was developed using
a benchtop device. The method of synthesis is rapid and versatile
and can be applied to different classes of DNA/protein. Employing
luminescent Au nanoclusters as the signal-generating agents, the device
enables carrying out reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
and array-based analyses of multiple genes/proteins simultaneously
using switchable holders and custom-designed software. The device
and methods were applied to evaluate gene profiling related to apoptosis
in HeLa cancer cells and further to analyze the protein expressions
of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and GST-tagged
human granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GST-hGMCSF)
recombinant proteins purified from bacterial strains of BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli (E. coli). The device with user-friendly methods for diagnosis using the
luminescence of Au nanoclusters offers potential use in disease diagnostics
with a vision to extend health care facilities especially to remote
geographical locations.

Introduction
Analyses
of genes and proteins can be considered as two pillars
key to the molecular basis of health analysis. An important aspect
is to develop new methods and devices for the analyses so that not
only faster and sensitive techniques are made available but also a
broad spectrum of the global populace can accrue the benefit of such
developments. This can possibly be achieved by combining the best
of well-established conventional gene and protein analysis protocols
and currently developing fields such as nanomaterials with extraordinary
optical properties.

Recent technological developments, in fields
of genomics and proteomics,
have helped to provide vital information coded in DNA and proteins
to predict potential disease targets and mutations, to infer on disease
susceptibility, and to discover novel therapeutic agents.1,2 The reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR, in
the case of genes) and high-throughput array-based methods (for analyses
of genes and proteins) have been central to the achievements.3,4 However, the advancements have been associated with sophisticated
instrumentation, complex and multistep fabrication and analysis techniques,
and involved processes for functionalization of the probes to achieve
high sensitivity and selectivity.5−8 Although an advanced technique such as quantitative
PCR (qPCR) can be implemented for real-time sample analysis, its usage
is not deemed necessary in many cases. Another technique, loop-mediated
isothermal amplification though promising, suffers from drawbacks
such as complicated primer designing method, challenges during multiplexing,
contamination and cannot be used for the amplification of sequences
of size >300 bp. Hence, semiquantitative PCR has remained a standard
technique in molecular diagnostics. Some of the earlier reported devices
(with thermocyclers and optical detection systems) were designed for
performing real-time PCR (or quantitative RT-PCR) and are generally
adopted for a limited number of samples (one to four) at a time.9,10 However, it is equally important to develop devices and easy methods
to be applicable in routine usages where the semiquantitative PCR
assay can be viewed as an useful alternative. A key aspect in PCR
carried out by specific primers is detection of DNA amplicons through
staining techniques for understanding the presence or absence of a
particular gene. These semiquantitative PCR-based approaches could
serve as a first-principle assay for understanding the infection status
or the presence of a particular genetic material (as well as protein)
for which qPCR is not mandatory. Additionally, there is concern over
the use of hazardous organic dyes and radioactive isotopes which are
less common but still considered for the staining of nucleic acids
and proteins.11,12 Most of the organic dyes used
as probes in staining techniques such as ethidium bromide (EtBr) were
found to be cytotoxic and mutagenic. Other alternatives such as SYBRSafe,
SafeView, RedSafe, and so forth, which are generally marketed as safe,
were found to be able to permeate the cell membrane very rapidly and
bind to DNA. They also show cytotoxicity and mutagenicity after metabolic
activation. Importantly, current methods commonly use multiple probes
(signal-generating agents) for the detection of both DNA and protein,
thus lacking universality of approach leading to careful design optimizations
of techniques and could be costly. Alternatively, one could develop
new technology that would unify both the gene and protein analyses
in a single platform by virtue of single biofriendly signal-generating
probe to achieve rapid staining techniques. This would allow easy
access of rapid diagnostics by a large population at an affordable
cost.13,14 The efficiency of the PCR process has been
improved through the usage of metal nanoparticles, quantum dots, carbon
nanotubes, carbon nanoparticles, graphene, etc.15−18 The plasmonic19,20 and luminescent21 nanomaterials are useful
as diagnostic probes in PCR and array-based methods. However, because
of high sensitivity and background-related issues, fluorometric techniques
are preferred over colorimetric assays.22 Use of conventional organic fluorophores is limited because of photobleaching,
photoblinking, and often the carcinogenic nature of the molecule.
Though quantum dots have been used as fluorometric tags in gene and
protein expression studies as better materials, their toxicity is
a concern.23−25 It is also worth noting here that most of the diagnostic
techniques (for RT-PCR and microarray) adopt initial synthesis of
nanomaterials followed by specific functionalization for conjugation
with biomolecules. This particular approach demands extra labor (such
as isolation of the probe) and processing and is thus time-consuming,
making them not suitable for fast detection. Also, as interaction
with biomolecules occurs post nanomaterials’ synthesis, there
lies a possibility that their complete conjugation may be difficult
to achieve because of potential loss of functionality to some extent.
Validation in every step is necessary to certify the functionality,
which is vital for subsequent interactions to occur. Alternatively,
few atom luminescent metal nanoclusters are an exciting option as
fluorophores because of their salient features including small size,
high photostability, low toxicity with respect to other fluorophores,
and low photoblinking.23 Recently, these
metal nanoclusters have been applied as luminescent probes for various
applications.26−30 Biomolecules such as DNA and proteins have been reported to be capable
of directing the synthesis of fluorescent metal nanoclusters. Gold
nanoclusters were also reported to be less cytotoxic and have good
renal clearance as suggested by in vivo studies. However, extensive
applications of these nanoclusters have so far been limited in rapid
detection assays involving DNA and proteins because of the requirement
of a large amount of precursors, a longer time period of synthesis,
and extensive purification steps.31,32 In the current
context, to employ them as signal-generating agents for both PCR and
array-based techniques, the synthesis should be rapid, applicable
for both DNA and protein (as direct template) in liquid as well as
in solid phase. Provided such an efficient synthesis procedure is
obtained integrating into the core functionality of PCR and array-based
studies, it could pave for the development of a device with common
mode of detection for the study of genes and proteins.

We report
a single platform based approach for carrying out RT-PCR
(nucleic acid amplification) and array-based analysis of multiple
genes/proteins with luminescent Au nanoclusters as signal-generating
agents using a benchtop device as illustrated in Scheme 1. The synthesis of Au nanoclusters
(signal-generating probes) involved a rapid single-step method and
can be carried out directly using DNA or protein. This synthesis of
Au nanoclusters on the PCR products in the tube itself or on the hybridized
PCR products in the nitrocellulose membrane or purified protein bound
to an antibody attached to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane
was achieved using the device itself and was all possible in one platform
(Scheme 1). The synthesis
was carried out in a rather short time to achieve nearly homogeneous
Au nanoclusters without any need for further processing and thereby
making it an excellent choice in applications as the diagnostic probe.
The luminescence of the Au nanoclusters was proportional to the amount
of the template present, that is, either DNA or protein concentration.
Hence, study of the luminescence profile revealed the nature of reactions/interactions
occurred provided there was a change in the amount of the biomolecule.
This principle of detection was applied for the semiquantitative analysis
of PCR products and for the array-based analysis of multiple samples
of DNA and protein. In the case of PCR amplicon quantification, the
device facilitated direct analysis of PCR products using the luminescence
of the Au nanoclusters within the PCR tube, thus avoiding the additional
step of gel electrophoresis. Paper-based membrane methods were adopted
for array-based analysis to avoid complex fabrication procedure and
made the whole process less expensive, easy to handle, flexible, and
disposable so that the technique can easily be adopted for medical
diagnostics even in remote areas.33,34 The traditional
dot-blot assays are useful for the analysis of a small number of samples
and are viable alternatives to highly sophisticated microarray platforms
especially in the case of first-principle analysis. The ability to
carry out membrane-based studies with rapid synthesis of Au nanoclusters
using the device is an important element in the current study. To
the best of our knowledge, the devices for qPCR with optical detection
setup do not provide such a rapid detection platform for the membrane-based
analysis of both genes and proteins using a single probe as demonstrated
in the present work. Moreover, the current approach helps to avoid
cross-contamination, which was observed in most of the devices based
on microfluidics approach for qPCR.9

Expression Studies and (C) Protein Expression Studies
For gene expression studies:
(i) Amplification of DNA: genes of interest in the cDNA (cDNA converted
from isolated RNA of cells) were amplified using the device. Synthesis
of Au nanoclusters was then carried out on the PCR amplicon (in the
tube) in a single temperature cycle using the thermocycler unit. The
Au nanoclusters synthesized in the PCR products were imaged in the
visualization unit under UV illumination. The intensities of emissions
from the Au nanoclusters were analyzed using the software to generate
information about amplification; (ii) DNA array: the PCR amplicons
were heated and snap-cooled to obtain single-stranded products using
the device and they were then spotted over the nitrocellulose membrane
containing preimmobilized complementary ssDNA. Au nanoclusters were
synthesized in a single temperature cycle on these spots and the membrane
was imaged and analyzed in a similar way as described before. For
protein expression studies: glutathione-S-transferase
(GST) antigens were extracted and purified from E.
coli BL21 (DE3) bacteria and were spotted on polyvinylidene
difluoride (PVDF) membrane containing preimmobilized GST antibodies.
Synthesis of Au nanoclusters was carried out on these spots using
a single temperature cycle and the membrane was imaged and analyzed
as detailed above. Here, NCs stand for nanoclusters.

The device and the methods proposed have been applied
to evaluate
gene profiling for the apoptotic pathway, where HeLa cancer cells
were treated with a commercially available drug doxorubicin and their
apoptotic gene expression profile was studied by Au nanocluster luminescence
in an array-based method as illustrated in Scheme 1B and was compared with conventional EtBr
staining. Also, for the study of protein expression, clinically important
protein glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and GST-tagged
human granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GST-hGMCSF)
expressed in Escherichia Coli (E. coli) BL21 (DE3) were used. The expressions were
studied using array-based methods using the same device as shown in Scheme 1C, following purification
and capture by an immobilized anti-GST antibody. The results matched
with conventional sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE).

Results and Discussion
Benchtop Device Hardware and Software
The device is
modular in design and constitutes two major blocks—thermocycler
and visualization unit (Figures 1A and S1). The device is
interfaced with computer/laptop and controlled through custom-developed
software as shown in the Supporting Information, Figures S2 and S3. The software can access both the blocks and
allow entering device-related parameters, controlling the sequence
of operations, performing image acquisition, and carrying out analysis.
The thermocycler unit is used to achieve temperature cycling necessary
for carrying out the RT-PCR process, gene/protein array-based experiments,
and synthesis of Au nanoclusters on DNA/protein both in the liquid
phase and on the membrane. This unit is equipped with switchable sample
holders to accommodate both commercially available PCR tubes and the
membrane (for array-based analysis), thus facilitating easy switching
between the two process as per need (Figure 1B). The bottom of the holder is exposed to
Peltier unit (that is connected to heatsink and fan), which heats
and cools the sample holder. The temperature of the holders can reach
between 10 and 100 °C. For a PCR tube holder, the average ramp
rate is about 0.95 °C/s (heating) and 1 °C/s (cooling).
On the other hand, the average ramp rate for the membrane holder is
about 1.2 °C/s (heating) and 1.3 °C/s (cooling). For the
PCR process, a lid is placed on the top of the tube and is kept in
hot condition to avoid condensation because of evaporation of the
liquid. The temperature of the lid can quickly go up to 120 °C
in about 150 s from room temperature (22 °C). Both the holders
and the lid are equipped with sensors for monitoring the temperatures.
A custom-designed-embedded circuit is the core electronic element
responsible for the operation of the thermocycler. Au nanoclusters
could be synthesized using the thermocycler unit itself with respective
holders either inside the PCR tube (in the case of DNA) or on the
membrane (in the case of gene/protein arrays). The visualization unit
consists of a UV light source (254 nm, 6W, with option for interchangeable
UV sources—short, mid, and long wavelength) to provide illumination
to the samples. It also features a camera source for visualization
and imaging of the samples (through the luminescence of the synthesized
Au nanoclusters). The design of the device offers considerable advantages:
(1) the switchable holders give the feasibility to carry out PCR and
array-based studies of both DNA and proteins in both liquid and solid
phases on a single platform. (2) The method involving the synthesis
of Au nanoclusters could be integrated in the device alongside the
conventional techniques. (3) The modular optimization of the thermocycler
and visualization unit (with imaging capabilities) provides a compact,
cost-effective platform for DNA and protein studies. Moreover, these
units could be independently used for different purposes. For example,
although we used UV source for illumination in our current study in
the visualization unit, it could be easily adapted to provide a wide
range of excitation wavelengths. (4) The developed software, besides
augmenting the operation experience, would allow complete analysis
of samples.

available PCR tubes or membrane (for array-based analysis). The figure

studies.

PCR Amplification and Quantification
Employing Au Nanoclusters
To evaluate the performance of
the device toward DNA amplification,
β-actin gene was amplified using specific primers—for
35 cycles. A similar set was amplified in a commercial PCR machine
(Palm cycler), keeping the conditions of amplification same in both
the cases. Standard gel electrophoresis with EtBr staining methods
was employed to analyze the PCR amplicons. The gel images of the PCR
amplicons as visualized in the gel documentation system are shown
in the Supporting Information, Figure S4.
Image analysis (densitometry) of gel bands revealed that a gene amplification
efficacy of about 95% could be obtained using the device, in comparison
to a commercial PCR machine. Instead of tedious gel electrophoresis
and use of EtBr for quantifying PCR products,35 we devised a method to use luminescent Au nanoclusters to visualize
the PCR amplicons following amplification in the device. We had earlier
reported36 the development of a temperature-dependent
facile and rapid synthesis of Au nanoclusters for DNA quantification.
Adopting a single heating and cooling cycle-based synthesis (the condition
similar to the conventional PCR) gives an advantage of synthesizing
the Au nanoclusters probe alongside PCR for gene quantification. The
current synthesis is found to be not affected by base pair compositions
and sequence lengths.36 On the other hand,
importantly, the luminescence of the formed Au nanoclusters was found
to be affected only by the amount of dsDNA used for the synthesis,
thus providing a method for semiquantification. Here, the same protocol
was adopted with the flexibility to carry out the same in the PCR
tube after gene amplification. The synthesis used the final PCR amplicon
as the template with HAuCl4 and 3-mercaptopropionic acid
(MPA) as the reagents and was subjected to a single heating and cooling
cycle (between the temperatures 95 and 15 °C) in the thermocycler
unit. This resulted in the synthesis of Au nanoclusters in proportion
to the amount of PCR amplicons (Supporting Information, Figure S5A). The Au nanoclusters exhibited luminescence with a
peak at 585 nm, when excited by 254 nm light (Supporting Information, Figure S5B). PCR amplicons or DNA
acted as a stabilizer by providing steric protection along with MPA
(auxiliary small-molecule stabilizer) which passivates the Au nanoclusters
through −S–Au bond linkages. It could be possible that
the clusters were stabilized by both DNA and −COO– groups
of MPA. In addition, MPA also contributed to the reduction of AuCl4– to produce nanoclusters.37,38 To employ these Au nanoclusters in quantification as signal-generating
agents, β-actin gene was amplified for different cycles (e.g.,
20, 25, 30, and 35) using specific primers in the thermocycler unit
of the device. Then, Au nanoclusters were synthesized on the PCR amplicons
by adding the reagents (HAuCl4 and MPA) to the PCR tube,
followed by heating to 95 °C for 2 min and then cooling down
to 15 °C for 3 min. The PCR tubes were then directly imaged in
the visualization unit under UV excitation of 254 nm, and the image,
shown in Figure 2,
was captured. It was observed that as the amount of the available
template (end-point PCR amplicon) increases with the number of cycles
of amplification, the formation of Au nanoclusters also increases
monotonically, generating higher luminescence. Further, the luminescence
of the synthesized Au nanoclusters provided a way for the semiquantification
of the PCR products which is essential in ascertaining the presence/absence
of a particular gene. It was also observed that the lowest amount
of DNA that the synthesized Au nanoclusters could differentiate was
for 20 cycles (starting with 0.5 μg of DNA). Another similar
set was amplified for different cycles and validated by a standard
process of agarose gel electrophoresis (with EtBr staining), which
was in good agreement with the results obtained.

amplified using specific primers using the
present device—for 20, 25, 30, and 35 cycles. (i) Gel images

UV illumination. (ii) Grayscale image of Au nanoclusters synthesized

Gene Expression Analysis
These results encouraged us
to extend the application of the device for studying the expression
of multiple genes simultaneously in an array format, using these Au
nanoclusters as the signal-generating agents. To achieve this, commercially
obtained single-stranded oligonucleotide (β-actin) probes, in
increasing concentrations, were immobilized in two rows on a nitrocellulose
membrane. Commercially obtained complementary target strands were
then hybridized on the spots in the second row only as shown in the Supporting Information, Figure S6. Au nanoclusters
were then synthesized on all the spots in the membrane in the thermocycler
unit as described above. Upon imaging in the visualization unit, the
luminescence of the Au nanoclusters was evident in the spots of the
membrane and it was observed that, for each concentration, the intensity
in hybridized dsDNA spot was more in comparison to that in the control
ssDNA spot, that is, for each of those spots present in the second
row.

Commercially obtained sequences of common apoptotic genes
(BCL-2, BAX, and Caspase-3) were chosen with the idea of extending
the application of Au nanoclusters toward apoptotic gene expression
profiling. Au nanoclusters were synthesized on different amounts of
hybridized dsDNA for each set of genes. It was observed that, in each
case, with the increase in the amount of the hybridized product, the
luminescence increased proportionately, as shown in the Supporting Information, Figure S7. A set of experiments
were also performed with Au nanoclusters synthesized on noncomplementary
pairs of commercially obtained sequences. The analysis showed that
the luminescence intensity of noncomplementary pairs was similar to
that of ssDNA controls immobilized on the membrane, as shown in the Supporting Information, Figure S8, possibly because
of washing away of the noncomplementary strands. These results suggest
that the luminescent Au nanoclusters are a viable alternative to commonly
used organic dyes for studying gene expression.

For the application
of Au nanoclusters in the study of relative
gene expressions during apoptosis in cancer cells, in vitro, relative
gene expression studies were carried out in HeLa cells, which were
subjected to apoptosis via anticancer drug doxorubicin. The apoptosis
specific genes in control and doxorubicin-treated cells (BCL-2, BAX,
and Caspase-3) were then amplified, in the device, using gene-specific
primers. Commercially obtained corresponding ssDNA apoptotic marker
genes were immobilized on the nitrocellulose membrane in increasing
amounts per spot. After this, PCR amplicons were heated and then snap-cooled
in the thermocycler (to obtain single-stranded products), and they
were subsequently transferred to the above spots containing ssDNA.
Following hybridization, Au nanoclusters were synthesized on these
spots, and the gene regulation outputs were quantified in correlation
to the luminescence profile. As is evident from the relative intensities
in Figure 3, the apoptotic
genes BAX and Caspase-3 were upregulated and BCL-2 was downregulated
with respect to endogenous control β-actin, signifying apoptosis
in the case of doxorubicin-treated HeLa cells in comparison to that
in the control HeLa cells. Here, we would like to mention that there
is an apparent anomaly in the observed data related to the concentration
of 0.74 μg of BCL-2, which is expected to result in the highest
luminescence among the set. This is caused because of the possible
saturation of the luminescence at concentration above 0.37 μg,
and any further increase in concentration caused a decrease in luminescence
intensity, as observed at 0.74 μg. However, this does not affect
the primary aim to understand the difference between the control and
treated samples and could be well-demarcated (at 0.74 μg) irrespective
of the decrease in luminescence. Conventional EtBr gel electrophoresis
studies corroborated the aforementioned results obtained by the use
of Au nanoclusters. Hence, Au nanoclusters were successfully applied
to probe the expressions of multiple genes governing the apoptosis
pathway in the HeLa cells. The short time and minimum precursor requirement
compared to earlier reports39,40 make the Au nanocluster
probe ideal for point-of-care detection. In addition, the current
method did not form any larger-sized Au nanoparticles alongside Au
nanoclusters, which was generally observed in previously reported
works.39,40 Also, the current method was applicable
for the synthesis of Au nanoclusters on both linear and plasmid forms
of DNA. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report of a common
method for the formation of Au nanoclusters on both linear and plasmid
forms. These Au nanoclusters were also found to be biocompatible and
noncytotoxic.36

multiple genes in control HeLa cells and

illumination (254 nm) of Au nanoclusters synthesized on various genes

ssDNA (as the capture agent) of BCL-2, BAX, and Caspase-3 in increasing
amounts ((i) 0.18, (ii) 0.37, and (iii) 0.74 μg; indicated by
the arrow) were immobilized on the nitrocellulose membrane in a single

BAX, and Caspase-3 for (i) 0.18, (ii) 0.37, and (iii) 0.74 μg
obtained from control and doxorubicin-treated cells were heated and
snap-cooled to achieve single-stranded products and were subsequently
hybridized to the above-mentioned capture probes in the specific row,
respectively. Au nanoclusters were then synthesized on all the spots
of the membrane. (C) Relative luminescence intensity of Au nanoclusters

Rapid Synthesis of Au Nanoclusters with Proteins
Building
on the successful applications of Au nanoclusters in assaying DNA,
we developed a novel method of synthesizing Au nanoclusters on protein
templates. This was to combine protein expression studies alongside
gene analysis in the same device. The synthesis in the presence of
proteins also involved a single-step heating and cooling cycle with
similar precursors as in the case of DNA. Au nanoclusters were synthesized
on bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the template—using HAuCl4 and MPA as the reagents—by heating to 95 °C for
2 min and cooling to 15 °C for 3 min. Au nanoclusters thus formed
emitted luminescence at 580 nm, when excited by 300 nm light. The
formation of the nanoclusters was found to be dependent on the amount
of protein. Also, the nanocluster synthesis is not specific to particular
protein sequence, and this has been demonstrated using different classes
of proteins. The versatility makes this assay applicable to a wide
range of proteins, which is necessary for diagnostic applications
(Supporting Information, Figure S9). The
luminescence profile of the Au nanoclusters for a range of concentrations
of protein (BSA) and HAuCl4 is shown in the Supporting Information, Figure S10. The surface
intensity plot (Supporting Information,
Figure S10) indicated that the luminescence intensity increased with
the amount of HAuCl4 (or protein) for a range of concentrations
of either protein (or HAuCl4), followed by decrease in
the luminescence after a certain concentration. As in the above case
with PCR amplicons/DNA, proteins are also a well-known template for
nanocluster synthesis. Hence, similar to the nanocluster synthesis
using DNA, here protein acted as the stabilizer with MPA as a reducing
agent. The fluorescence spectrum of only MPA and HAuCl4 showed the formation of extremely low-intensity Au nanoclusters,
while no formation of Au nanoclusters was found in the case of only
protein and HAuCl4. However, in the presence of protein
along with MPA and HAuCl4, the intensity of the formed
Au nanoclusters was significantly high and was also found to be stable
in nature. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed the formation
of small particles owing to Au nanoclusters and also indicated an
increase in the particle size from 0.75 ± 0.27 to 5.81 ±
2.05 nm, with increasing concentrations of HAuCl4 (Supporting Information, Figure S11). Also, circular
dichroism (CD) spectroscopy revealed that the formation of Au nanoclusters
did not alter significantly the 3D structure of BSA (Supporting Information, Figure S12). The photoluminescence
quantum yield of Au nanoclusters on proteins was found to be 4.5%,
thus making them suitable for sensing applications. Also, when compared
to an organic dye rhodamine 6G with the fluorescence decrease rate
of 2.7% per min, the Au nanoclusters showed a fluorescence decrease
rate of 0.26% per min, indicating higher photostability (Supporting Information, Figure S13). The matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis (Supporting Information, Figure S14) showed a
distinct peak at 71171 (m/z). The m/z difference between BSA and Au nanoclusters
is 4350.8 (m/z), favoring possible
formation of (Au16(MPA)11 + 2Na+ –
H+)−1 corresponding to a metal cluster
with 16 Au atoms.

Protein Expression Analysis
For
the application of
these Au nanoclusters in protein expression studies, the expression
profiling of GST and GST-hGMCSF in E. coli BL 21 (DE3) cells was performed after their isolation and purification.
The integrity and functionality of the isolated proteins (GST and
GST-hGMCSF) were analyzed by using standard SDS-PAGE, CD spectroscopy,
Bradford assay, and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) assay (Supporting Information, Figures S15 and S16).
In SDS-PAGE, bands corresponding to GST and GST-hGMCSF were observed
at 26 and 42 kDa, respectively, and concentrations of the proteins
obtained from the Bradford assay were 239 and 96 μg/mL for GST
and GST-hGMCSF, respectively. CD spectroscopy confirmed that 3D conformation
of GST41 as well as GST-hGMCSF42 was intact for functionality. Also, the CNDB
assay specific for the determination of the GST enzyme activity confirmed
that the GST was functional for both the cases of GST and GST-hGMCSF.

After obtaining the proteins (GST and GST-hGMCSF) in their functional
forms, they were allowed to interact with their respective anti-GST
antibodies previously immobilized on the PVDF membrane along with
their GST, GST-hGMCSF, and anti-GST antibody controls. Then, Au nanoclusters
were synthesized on the respective spots using the thermocycler unit
in a single cycle of heating and cooling as in the case of DNA (described
earlier). Thereafter, the membrane was imaged using the visualization
unit, and the luminescence intensity of the Au nanoclusters was found
to be the highest in the case of GST–anti-GST antibody conjugate
followed by GST-hGMCSF–anti-GST antibody conjugate, when compared
to only GST, GST-hGMCSF, and anti-GST antibody as shown in Figure 4. These results corroborated
the standard SDS-PAGE and Bradford assay results obtained previously.
As the formation of the nanoclusters was found to be dependent on
the amount of protein, it was observed that in the case of immobilized
antibodies, or only GST protein on the membrane, there was no visible
formation of nanoclusters as an adequate amount of protein was absent
in both these cases. Whereas when both the immobilized antibodies
along with the GST protein were present together, the increase in
the amount of the protein content led to the formation of nanoclusters.
Hence, in the absence of the analyte, which can be either the antibody
or the antigen depending on the assay, the luminescence will not be
generated or will be always less compared to the antigen–antibody
conjugate. As a control experiment, specific GST protein and a nonspecific
BSA protein interacted with the anti-GST antibody, and it was found
that the luminescence did not get enhanced in the case of BSA as it
did with increasing concentrations of GST, possibly because of washing
away of the nonspecific BSA antigen (Supporting Information, Figure S17). Hence, it can be concluded that the
luminescent Au nanoclusters, synthesized in situ, were efficient probes
for the protein expression studies. The same advantages as mentioned
above for the use of Au nanoclusters as probes for gene expression
studies also apply for the protein expression studies. The rapid method
of synthesis directly on PCR products/proteins with minimum precursor
concentrations, biocompatibility, and concentration-dependent luminescence
makes the current study an important addition in the analysis of gene/protein
expression.

illumination (254 nm) of Au nanoclusters synthesized on various proteins
(spots). First, increasing concentrations ((i) 0.1, (ii) 0.2, and
(iii) 0.4 μg) of anti-GST antibody were immobilized onto the
PVDF membrane in two rows and interacted with increasing concentrations
((i) 0.08, (ii) 0.16, and (iii) 0.32 μg) of GST-hGMCSF in one
row and with ((i) 0.1, (ii) 0.2, and (iii) 0.4 μg) of pure GST
in another row. Only GST-hGMCSF, pure GST, and Ab (anti-GST) were
also immobilized in separate rows on the PVDF membrane in increasing
amounts for comparison and analysis. (B) Relative luminescence intensities
(with respect to the maximum mean intensity in the entire data) of
Au nanoclusters synthesized on spotted proteins as mentioned above.
The graph depicts the averaged intensity of data from three separate
experiments with their standard deviation. (C) SDS-PAGE analysis of

0.001 with respect to Ag or Ab.

Enhancement of Sensitivity with Zinc Ions
It may further
be mentioned here that in array-based analysis, involving either gene
or protein, addition of zinc ions during the synthesis of Au nanoclusters
enhanced the luminescence intensity of the Au nanoclusters. As shown
in the Supporting Information, Figure S18,
in one of the rows, zinc ions were added during the synthesis of Au
nanoclusters. As is evident from the image analysis, the luminescence
intensity increased in the case where zinc ions were added to the
reaction mixture. The reason for the increase in luminescence may
be attributed to the aggregation of Au nanoclusters caused by zinc
ions.43 Thus, this technique can be used
for the enhancement of luminescence in the case of lower signal intensity.

Conclusions
We presented a single platform for the assaying
of genes and proteins
based on luminescent biofriendly Au nanoclusters using a benchtop
device. The facile and rapid synthesis of biocompatible signal-generating
agents (Au nanoclusters) on both DNA and proteins allowed semiquantitative
and qualitative analyses. Further, it provided a method of synthesis
of Au nanoclusters as a common probe for both DNA and protein studies
(in liquid as well as samples on the membrane), PCR amplicon detection,
and membrane-based studies in a single device. The device was able
to deliver PCR amplification efficiency of about 95% in comparison
to the commercially available machine. The custom-developed software
simplified the operation to enhance the user experience and to perform
tasks like providing input parameters and image acquisition and analysis.
The modular design of the device permits easy upgradation. Importantly,
the techniques, methods, and materials employed are bio- and environmentally
friendly. Taken into account all these sublime features, the device
and the integrated methods may add a new dimension to the existing
techniques with the amalgamation of nanotechnology and biology. This
may create motivation to converge various techniques and develop methods
in a view to make rapid diagnostics available to a majority of people
across the globe.

Methods
Amplification of DNA with
the Device
β-actin
gene was amplified for 35 cycles using specific primers in both the
conventional PCR machine (Palm cycler) and the present device, keeping
the conditions as initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min followed
by 35 cycles of three phases: 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for
30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. After this, final extension was carried
out at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR amplicons obtained from both
the devices were analyzed using standard gel electrophoresis with
EtBr staining. The stained gel was visualized under UV illumination
as shown in the Supporting Information,
Figure S4. The amplification achieved by the present device was about
95% compared to conventional PCR machine as analyzed from the image.

Quantification of PCR Products Using Au Nanoclusters
Two
sets of β-actin gene were amplified for 20, 25, 30, and
35 cycles using specific primers using the thermocycler unit of the
device with the conditions as initial denaturation at 95 °C for
3 min followed by the specific number of thermal cycles with each
cycle as 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for
1 min, and final extension for 10 min.

In the first set, Au
nanoclusters were synthesized using the thermocycler with the following
protocol. HAuCl4 (1.0 mM, 17 wt % Au, in dilute HCl; 99.99%,
Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.01 M MPA (Sigma-Aldrich) were added in 3:1 (v/v)
ratio to the end-point PCR product (inside the PCR tube itself), heated
at 95 °C for 2 min, and then cooled at 15 °C for 3 min.
This resulted in the formation of Au nanoclusters in proportion to
the amplification. The final PCR tubes containing the PCR amplicons
with synthesized Au nanoclusters were then imaged and analyzed using
the visualization unit under UV excitation of 254 nm. Standard gel
electrophoresis with EtBr staining is carried out for the second set
of PCR amplicons. The gel was visualized under UV illumination.

Gene Expression Studies
a) cDNA extraction from control HeLa cells
and doxorubicin-treated HeLa cells: HeLa cancer cells were cultured
in two 60 mm culture plates with a cell density of 1 × 106 cells. Keeping one of the plates as the control, the other
plate was treated with anticancer drug doxorubicin for 24 h. Using
the standard RNA protocol, RNA was isolated from both the cells (control
and treated). cDNA was obtained from mRNA using the thermocycler (at
42 °C for 40 min and 95 °C for 2 min) with Verso cDNA kit.

b) Amplification of specific
genes using
the thermocycler unit of the device: BAX, BCL-2, and Caspase-3 along
with endogenous control β-actin were amplified using specific
primers for 35 cycles (denaturation: 95 °C for 3 min; 35 cycles
with three phases: 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C
for 1 min, and final extension for 10 min).

c) Immobilization of complementary oligonucleotide
on the nitrocellulose membrane: nitrocellulose membrane (Zeta Probe
blotting membranes; cut to maximum dimensions of 40 mm × 40 mm)
was activated in 1× SSC (saline sodium citrate) buffer and was
allowed to air-dry. The commercial oligonucleotides were spotted and
UV-cross linked in an array format by the standard process.

d) Hybridization of heated
and snap-cooled
PCR products to the complementary oligonucleotides immobilized on
the nitrocellulose membrane: the PCR products were heated and snap-cooled
and hybridized to their respective immobilized complementary nucleotides
by the following process.

The membrane
was blocked before hybridization using
blocking solution (1% PVP-10, 1% PEG 6000, and 0.05% Tween-20) for
15 min to avoid unspecific binding. The hybridization was carried
out in 5× SSC buffer and 10% poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) 6000
at 60 °C for half an hour. The membrane was then washed with
1X SSC buffer.

e) Synthesis
of Au nanoclusters on a hybridized
membrane: after hybridization, synthesis of Au nanoclusters was carried
out on the spots by adding 1.5 μL of 0.7 mM HAuCl4 and 0.5 μL of 0.01 M MPA, followed by heating the membrane
using the thermocycler at 95 °C for 2 min and then cooling at
15 °C for 3 min.

f) Image acquisition and analysis: the
membrane with synthesized Au nanoclusters was imaged and analyzed
using the visualization unit using custom-developed software under
UV illumination (254 nm).



Synthesis of
the Au Nanoclusters Using BSA as the Template
For synthesis,
20 μL of (0.05–1.0 mg/mL) BSA (Himedia)
was taken, and to that 0.4 μL of 10 mM HAuCl4 and
0.16 μL of 0.11 M of MPA were added, and the mixture was heated
at 95 °C for 2 min and then cooled at 15 °C for 3 min.

Protein Expression Studies
a) Expression and purification of GST
and GST-hGMCSF in Escherichia coli BL21
DE3: for primary culture, 20 μL of E. coli BL21 DE3 stock harboring pGEX4t2 vector was inoculated in 3 mL of
LB (Luria–Bertani) media with 3 μL of 100 mg/mL ampicillin
and was incubated overnight at 37 °C (180 rpm). The grown primary
culture (2 mL) was inoculated into 200 mL LB media with 200 μL
of 100 mg/mL ampicillin and was incubated at 37 °C (180 rpm)
until an optical density (O.D.) of 0.6 was obtained. Following this,
induction was given by 1 mL of isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside
(24 mg/mL) at 24 °C (180 rpm, 6 h). The cells were then centrifuged
at 6000 rpm (4 °C, 7 min), and the pellet hence obtained was
stored at −20 °C. For the preparation of lysis buffer
(7 mL), 100 μL of 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and 100
μL of 1 mM phenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride were added to 1X
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cell pellet was then resuspended
in lysis buffer homogenously and was sonicated with a probe sonicator
for 5 min. Centrifugation was carried out at 12 000 rpm (4
°C, 20 min), and the supernatant was collected. The supernatant
obtained in the previous step contained solubilized protein. It was
first filtered through a 0.45 μm syringe filter and was then
put into a glutathione agarose beads column (prepared previously by
the standard method) for half an hour. Flow-through fractions were
collected, followed by washing of the column eight times with PBS.
For elution buffer preparation, 20 mg of reduced glutathione was added
to 5 mL of 50 mM tris (pH 8). Recombinant GST bound to the affinity
column was eluted with the elution buffer after 20 min. Multiple-flow
through fractions were collected and analyzed using 12% SDS PAGE.
A similar protocol was adopted for the isolation and purification
of GST-hGMCSF.44

b) Estimation of protein by the Bradford
assay: the concentration of the purified recombinant GST proteins
was estimated using the Bradford assay. The standard solution was
prepared using the BSA of concentrations 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 10 μg/mL,
and 10 μL of the protein sample (recombinant GST proteins) was
used for analysis along with 90 μL of Bradford reagent solution
(Sigma-Aldrich). It was allowed to react at room temperature for 10
min in dark, and the optical density at 595 nm was measured using
a TECAN Elisa plate reader.

c) Enzyme activity: GST activity was determined
using the CDNB assay: the increasing amount of protein solutions with
1X PBS buffer (pH 7.5), 1.0 mM GSH, and 1.0 mM CDNB, amounting to
the total volume of 100 μL, was taken in a 96-well plate. The
control wells contained PBS, CDNB, and glutathione. After 10 min,
the change in absorbance with respect to control was measured at 340
nm using a Tecan Elisa plate reader. One unit of activity is defined
as the formation of 1 μM product per min at 25 °C (εmM is the extinction coefficient at 340 nm in a 96-well plate
is 5.3 for CDNB, and D is the dilution factor).    

d) Immobilization of primary antibody
on the PVDF membrane in an array pattern: the primary antibody specific
to the GST antigen was immobilized on the PVDF membrane (IMMOBILON
P 0.45 μm membrane) by spotting different dilutions of primary
antibody after activating the membrane of suitable dimensions (with
maximum dimensions of 40 mm × 40 mm) in methanol. After spotting,
the membrane was allowed to air-dry for 15–20 min.

e) Interaction of antigens
with antibodies
on the PVDF membrane: the membrane was blocked using blocking solution
(as mentioned above) for 30 min to avoid unspecific binding, after
that the membrane was incubated with respective GST antigens for 30
min and was washed with PBST (PBS with Tween 20) buffer for reducing
nonspecificity.

f) Synthesis
of Au nanoclusters on the
PVDF membrane: after antigen–antibody interactions, Au nanoclusters
were synthesized on the spots, by adding 1.5 μL of 0.7 mM HAuCl4 and 0.5 μL of 0.01 M MPA followed by heating the membrane
using a thermocycler at 95 °C for 2 min and then cooling at 15
°C for 3 min.

g) Image
acquisition and analysis: the
membrane with synthesized Au nanoclusters was imaged and analyzed
using the visualization unit using custom-developed software under
UV illumination (254 nm).
