Using computational tools, we study the behavior of activities
of lattice vibrational Raman modes in few-layered phosphorene of up
to four layers subjected to a uniaxial strain of −2 to +6%
applied in the armchair and zigzag directions. We study both high-
and low-frequency modes and find very appreciable frequency shifts
in response to the applied strain of up to ≈20 cm–1. The Raman activities are characterized by Ag2/Ag1 activity ratios, which provide very
meaningful characteristics of functionalization via layer- and strain-engineering.
The ratios exhibit a pronounced vibrational anisotropy, namely a linear
increase with the applied armchair strain and a highly nonlinear behavior
with a strong drop of the ratio with the strain applied along the
zigzag direction. For the low-frequency modes, which are Raman active
exclusively in few-layered systems, we find the breathing interlayer
modes of primary importance due to their strong activities. For few-layered
structures with a thickness ≥4, a splitting of the breathing
modes into a pair of modes with complementary activities is found,
with the lower frequency mode being strain activated. Our calculated
database of results contains full angular information on activities
of both low- and high-frequency Raman modes. These results, free of
experimental complexities, such as dielectric embedding, defects,
and size and orientation of the flakes, provide a convenient benchmark
for experiments. Combined with high-spatial-resolution Raman scattering
experiments, our calculated results will aid in the understanding
of the complicated inhomogeneous strain distributions in few-layered
phosphorene or the manufacture of materials with desired electronic
properties via strain- or layer-engineering.

1 Introduction
Few-layered black phosphorus
(BP) (Figure 1) is
a two-dimensional (2D) material that
has recently received renewed attention.1−9 This interest was fueled by its intrinsic strongly thickness-dependent
direct bandgap ranging from 0.3 for bulk10 to ≈2.0 eV for a monolayer,1,6,8,9 thus bridging bandgaps
between graphene and transition-metal dichalcogenides. The strong
thickness dependence of electronic gaps was attributed to interlayer
coupling, which is appreciably stronger in BP than in other 2D materials,
such as graphene or transition-metal dichalcogenides.11,12 The room-temperature free-carrier mobility approaches ≈1000
cm2 V–1 s–1,3 which exceeds that of other typical 2D semiconductors,
such as molybdenum sulfate (≈200 cm2 V–1 s–1 1,13). Combined with a high
on–off ratio,3 these properties
hold prospects for electronic and optoelectronic applications.1,2,14,15

Raman modes (Ag1 out-of-plane, B2g along ZZ, and Ag2 along AC). (d) Strongest-intensity
low-frequency Raman breathing modes (B1(Ag) and B2(Ag)). The other
LF modes have intensities that are several orders of magnitude lower.

In addition to layer-engineering, the unique electronic
properties
of few-layered phosphorene (FLP) can among others further be tuned
by dielectric embedding and applied strain. Dielectric embedding refers to naturally entering a substrate for
anchoring a 2D material and often, specifically for phosphorene, also
as a capping material to avoid degradation due to oxidation. Dielectric
embedding is expected to affect appreciably the dielectric function,
exciton binding energies, quasiparticle gaps,9 and vibrational properties.

The importance of strain-engineering,
or straintronics,16 in 2D materials is
due to their ability to sustain
much larger strains in excess of ≈10%, both compressive/tensile
in-plane and normal compressive,17 compared
to just ≈2% by their three-dimensional counterparts.16,18,19 For instance, single-layered
MoS2 has a huge strain sensitivity of the bandgap from
1.8 to 0 eV in comparison with the poor window of tunability of only
0.25 eV achieved for strained silicon at 1.5% biaxial strain.16 In addition to the in-plane strain, the effect
of ripples and wrinkles with significant out-of-plane deformations
has also been studied20,21 and their strongly anisotropic
effect on electronic properties and the chemical activity of phosphorene
is predicted.21 A wealth of properties
under strain has been reported in FLP such as topological phase transition
from normal to the quantum-spin Hall state,22 onset of superconductivity,23 a complex
dependence of the bandgap ranging from metallic to semiconducting
and featuring both direct and indirect bandgaps in single- and few-layered
phosphorene,24−26 a negative Poisson’s ratio,27 a strain-engineered ultrahigh carrier mobility,28 strain-modulated thermal conductivity,29 or funneling of excitons in MoS2 toward
the point of applied strain upon illumination.30

Phonons, in addition to electrons, are the most important
collective
excitations as their interactions with electrons and photons determine
material’s properties such as the carrier mobility, light-emitting
efficiency, etc. In FLP, phonons have been found to be exceptionally
anharmonic and anisotropic31,32 as evidenced by angle-resolved
absorption and Raman spectroscopies, which also contribute to electron–photon
and electron–phonon anisotropies.33 Furthermore, these anisotropies show a nontrivial dependence on
the sample thickness and phonon and photon energies.33 Vibrational properties of 2D materials can be used to determine
properties of materials prepared by layer-engineering, dielectric
embedding, and straintronics. For instance, the relative layer thickness
of FLP, in addition to optical contrast measurement, can be determined
from vibrational analyses19 based on Raman
active (R) low-frequency (LF) breathing modes active only in FLP,
which are absent from single-layered and bulk BP.

Strain in
real materials is unusually complicated and in a 2D structure
usually induces an inhomogeneous distribution. Hence, measuring and
understanding strain and its spatial distribution is a primary prerequisite
for strain-engineering. Phonons and Raman active modes, due to their
high spatial resolution, play an important role also in extracting
strain information. Indeed, substantial frequency shifts of Raman
modes under various strain conditions have been reported in FLP experimentally12,32,34 and in density functional theory
(DFT) modeling,26,32,34,35 including strain effects on the low- and
ultralow-frequency modes,12 paving the
way to the measurement of strain and its inhomogeneous distributions.

Furthermore, due to the strong anisotropy of BP, the susceptibility
of the vibrational modes is also very selective to the strain applied
in the armchair (AC) and zigzag (ZZ) directions.26,32,34,35

It is
expected that the vibrational properties will also be affected
by the dielectric embedding via modification of the dielectric function.
However, to focus on a single phenomenon, here, we study freestanding
FLP, which should be kept in mind when comparing the simulations with
the experimental results.

In FLP, two very different types of
Raman modes are present: high-frequency
(HF, >350 cm–1) intralayer and low-frequency
(LF,
<100 cm–1) interlayer modes.19 While the HF modes involve vibrations from intralayer chemical
bonds, the LF modes probe the relative motion of the layers and, hence,
the predominantly van der Waals (vdW) interlayer interactions. In
an unstrained FLP, Ag1, B2g, and Ag2 modes are normally experimentally observed
at frequencies of ≈365, ≈440, and ≈470 cm–1,19 respectively (see Figure 1). Following the
vibration-mode symmetry and back-scattering setup, the intensity of
the Ag modes changes with the variation period of 180°,
but the maximum intensity occurs at different polarization angles,
depending on the sample thickness.19,32 The intensity
of the Ag1 mode
appears to be especially thickness-sensitive.32 The intensity of the B2g mode has a variation period
of 90° and the minimum intensity corresponding to the armchair
and zigzag polarizations.19,32 Because of the crystal
symmetry and corresponding selection rules, the LF modes are not active
in single-layered and bulk BP. They appear in FLP in the form of three
types of LF R modes, two shear and one breathing (B1g,
B3g, and Ag),19,26 experimentally
observed at ≈26.2, ≈75.6, and 85.6 cm–1.19 While all three R LF modes have intensities
significantly weaker than the R HF modes, the breathing Ag mode again stands out as having an intensity significantly higher
than those of the other two shear modes. In particular, starting from
four layers, the breathing Ag mode splits into two modes,
B1 and B2, as shown in Figure 1.

While several experimental12,32,34 and simulation studies26,32,34,35 of strain effects on vibrational
modes in FLP exist, to the best of our knowledge, no computational
study of strain effects on intensities of Raman vibrational modes
in FLP exists. Based on a computational density functional theory
(DFT)36 study, the aim of the present paper
is to fill the gaps in understanding vibrations in FLP under strain,
including the R intensities of both HF and LF modes. This is done
by focusing on the strongly anisotropic effects of uniaxial AC and
ZZ strains on vibrational properties of FLP of up to four layers,
a thickness at which the vibrational properties are already reminiscent
of those of the bulk.37

2 Results and Discussion
We now discuss
the effect induced on the Raman modes by the different
strains (AC and ZZ) applied to mono-, bi-, tri-, and four-layered
BF.

2.1 Layer Dependence
To set the stage,
we show in Figure 2 the dependence of the activity of R HF modes on the number of layers L for unstrained FLP for L = 1–4.
One can clearly see that the Ag1 and Ag2 modes have activities appreciably larger than
that of the B2g mode, which has a negligible activity for L = 1, 2, and 3 and a fairly weak activity only for L = 4 of the B2g mode. The other trend clearly
visible is the increase in the activity of the Ag1 mode relative to the Ag2 with the number
of layers.

Figure 2 Activity of HF Raman modes in FLP with different numbers of layers.

Qualitatively, both trends are supported by experiments,
which
show that the intensity of the Ag1 mode is extremely sensitive to and increases
with the sample thickness.32

The
experimental intensity of the B2g mode also increases
with the number of layers,37 and hence
this trend is visible in our four-layer results. The intensity of
the B2g mode also shows an extreme angular dependence,
and consequently, the experimental intensities vary considerably with
the polarization angle (see Figure S4).
The activity of the B2g mode is significantly smaller than
that of the Ag modes, and consequently, the B2g mode is barely visible in our angularly averaged activities dominated
by the A modes. It should be noted that the published ratios of intensities
of the R HF A and B modes vary appreciably between different experiments.5,34,37,38 We attribute this to the angular dependence of these modes (see Figure S4).

2.2 Effect of Strain on High-Frequency Raman Modes
The effect of strain on activities of HF R modes was studied for
FLP in the range of L = 1–4. An example of
results for a bilayer is shown in Figure 3; for the rest of the results, see the Supporting
Information (SI). In analogy with experiments,32,34 we first analyze the strain-induced shifts of R peaks. For strains
in the window of ⟨−2, +2%⟩, the AC and ZZ strains
cause linear shifts of the peak positions. More importantly, the AC
and ZZ strains have completely opposite effects on the highest activity
of R HF modes. ZZ strain causes red shifts of Ag2 and B2g modes, while
the Ag1 mode
exhibits only a negligible peak shift. In contrast, AC strain causes
blue shifts of Ag2 and B2g modes, while the Ag1 mode exhibits a red shift. The largest
frequency shifts we observe in the studied range of strains ⟨−2,
+4%⟩ are very significant (≈20 cm–1). The B2g mode for strain applied in the ZZ direction
exhibits an even larger response, albeit at very low activity. In
general, the shifts in the frequencies of the R HF modes are larger
for strains applied in the ZZ direction than in the AC direction.
Similar trends apply also to the other L (see the SI).

in bilayer BPs. Top,
AC strain; bottom, ZZ strain. Dashed black lines are to guide the
eyes.

Our results on stress-induced frequency shifts
can be compared
with experimental results corresponding to uniaxial strain applied
separately approximately in the AC and ZZ directions albeit on significantly
thicker phosphorene samples (2–9 layers34 and 5–30 layers)32 and
to DFT calculations32 on single- and double-layered
phosphorene in a set-up (PBE xc-functional39 and optB86b-vdW40 to model the vdW interlayer
interactions) very similar to ours (PBE xc-functional and DFT-D2 model
to describe the vdW interactions). Our calculated strain-induced frequency
shifts (Figures 3 and S4) can in a limited range of strains of approx.
±2% be approximated by straight lines. Experimentally, a linear
behavior is observed for a much wider range of strains of up to ≈7%
on much thicker samples.32 The calculated
rates of strain-induced frequency change per strain-percentage are
compared with experimental32,34 and alternative simulation
results32 in Table 1. The strain response is significantly stronger
in the ZZ than in the AC direction. Qualitative agreement with experiments
is very good. Similar to the alternative simulation results,32 our calculated trends exhibit a stronger strain
response of the B2g and Ag2 modes in the ZZ direction than in the experiments.
The weaker experimental response may be due to the different experimental
sample thicknesses and possible sample misalignment. Perhaps surprisingly,
even the experimental results exhibit quantitative differences of
≈50% or occasional opposite trends, which we speculate may
result from sample misorientation, different thicknesses, or dielectric
embedding. We have tested the influence of the interlayer electronic
coupling by comparing selected vibrational frequencies in the presence
and absence of the D2 correction41 to PBE. The results in the SI show that the inclusion of the D2 correction
invariably increases all Raman vibrational frequencies, both high
and low frequency. This also means that even in the absence of interlayer
electronic coupling and/or vdW interactions, purely classical long-range
dipole or higher multipole interactions can play a role in influencing
the vibrational properties.

Compared to frequency shifts, the intensities are
more difficult
to quantify as both experimental spectra42 and calculated spectra may use different normalizations. Therefore,
the ratio of intensities of the main peaks, Ag2/Ag1, is often used, making the ratio less
susceptible to normalization. In addition, the intensity ratio is
also used to determine the number of layers37 or oxidation level in photo-assisted oxidation.5 The Ag2/Ag1 peak ratio
characteristics are based on the sensitivity of the Ag1 peak to the layer
thickness.32 In contrast, for a given L, the Ag2/Ag1 peak ratio has only a negligible angular dependence (see also Figure S4), making results of different experiments
easily comparable.

As an approximation to the experimental Raman
Ag2/Ag1 intensity ratio,
we calculate Raman
Ag2/Ag1 activity ratios
in equilibrium and also as a function of strain applied along the
AC and ZZ directions. The results are shown in Figures 4 and 5. The different
types of strains have vastly different effects on the Ag2/Ag1 activity ratios.
While the application of an AC strain leads essentially to a uniform
linear increase of the ratio in the studied range of strains, application
of the ZZ strain exhibits a highly nonuniform behavior with an essentially
linear increase from tensile to moderate compressive strains of ≈2%
and then a sharp drop for larger compressive strains. We note that
this behavior is unlikely to be induced by a direct to indirect gap
transition or by a semiconductor to metal transition in response to
the applied strain as the gap response in our DFT model is broadly
similar for the strain applied in the AC and ZZ directions (see the SI).

the applied strain (top) and the number of layers (bottom) for strain
applied in the AC direction.

Figure 5 Intensity ratio of the key high-frequency modes as a function
of
the applied strain (top) and the number of layers (bottom) for strain
applied in the ZZ direction. Note the deviation of the results for L = 3 from general trends likely caused by numerical factors.
These results are not included in the bottom panel.

Figures 4 and 5 also show the Ag2/Ag1 activity ratio
plotted against the number
of layers, L, for strain applied in the AC and ZZ
directions, respectively, which is the usual form in the unstrained
FLP.5,37 The plot for AC strain shows the typical
saturation around L ∼ 3 also found experimentally37 at zero strain, which corresponds to the intensity
saturation of the Ag1 peak with L (see also Figure 2). For the strain applied in the ZZ direction,
the plot is initially qualitatively similar to the AC strains of up
to ≈+2% followed by a steep drop for strains ≥2%. We
note that measured Ag2/Ag1 ratios of Lu et al.38 and Zhang et al.37 for unstrained FLP differ by a factor of 5,
with our results being close to those of Lu et al.38 The main quantitative difference between the AC and ZZ
strains is that the applied compressive strain tends to flatten the
curve and that the effect is stronger for the ZZ strain than for the
AC strain up to ≈2% at which strain a significant change in
the Ag2/Ag1 activity ratio
is predicted in the ZZ direction, reconfirming the strongly anisotropic
behavior of the Raman vibrational modes.

2.3 Effect of Strain on Low-Frequency Raman Modes
Despite the, in general, much lower intensities of the R LF modes,
they play a very important role in the FLP.12,19 Their behavior under applied AC and ZZ strains is shown in Figure 6 for a four-layered
BP. Four-layered BP is special in that, here, as shown in Figure 1, two breathing modes
are found, B1 and B2. For thinner FLP, the peaks
shrink into a single feature, while for much thicker systems, intensities
of the breathing modes are expected to vanish.19,26 From Figure 6, three
trends are evident: (1) the frequency of both breathing modes decreases
with increased compressive strain applied both along the AC and ZZ
directions, except for the largest strain of +6% applied in the AC
direction; (2) the shifts of the Raman frequencies are again quite
significant, up to ≈15 cm–1, especially for
the AC strain; (3) the activities of the B1/B2 modes are complementary, that is, where the activity of one increases
in response to applied strain, the other decreases and vice versa.
For clarity, the last feature is depicted in Figure 7 where the complementary intensities are
clearly visible. Interestingly, unlike the B2 mode, which
shows appreciable activity at any strain load, including equilibrium,
the B1 mode appears to be strain activated, equally by
both AC and ZZ strains, and its predicted activity in the unstrained
state vanishes.

BP.
Top, AC strain; bottom, ZZ strain.

Figure 7 Raman intensity (normalized; I1 + I2 = 1) of the key low-frequency modes
as a function
of strain for AC (top panel) and ZZ strains (bottom panel).

The low-frequency vibrational modes have been experimentally
studied.12,19 Ultralow- (≈15–40 cm–1) and low-frequency
(≈70–90 cm–1) modes12 with completely different properties were reported. While
the ultralow-frequency mode requires the presence of a substrate,
the low-frequency mode, experimentally located at ≈80 cm–1 in four layers, corresponds to our B2 mode
(≈90 cm–1 without strain). Importantly, no
B1 mode (≈40 cm–1 from our simulation)
was detected in the experiment without applied strain, which is in
agreement with our model.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, using density
functional theory modeling, we have
presented the lattice vibrational study of Raman modes of strained
few-layered phosphorene, up to a thickness of four layers, focusing
on Raman activities, which are closely related to the experimentally
measured intensities. We find that the Raman modes exhibit a qualitatively
complex strain response, which is quantitatively strong. Furthermore,
in addition to strongly anisotropic excitons,6 electron mobility,28 and thermal conductivity,29 strong anisotropy is also found in vibrational
properties, which yields qualitatively very different responses to
strains applied in the AC and ZZ directions. Indeed, our simulations
predict a significant modification of HF vibrational properties for
compressive strains in excess of 2% applied in the ZZ direction.

Our study also pays attention to the low-frequency modes, which,
up to date, have received much less attention12,19 despite their indisputable importance. We observed two LF R interlayer
breathing modes (B1, B2) with complementary
intensities. The B1 mode appears to be strain activated.
The B2 mode is in good agreement with the experimentally
detected LF mode.12 We note that the strong
interlayer interaction in BP is not due to the electronic hybridization
of the lone electron pairs as suggested previously,11 but, as follows from accurate quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)
calculations of Shuleburger et al.,43 is
rather purely vdW. The strong interaction can naturally be explained
by the fairly large c6 constant of phosphorus,
compared to those of carbon (graphene) or sulfur (molybdenum sulfide).44

A comparison of our calculated predictions
with experiments shows
generally excellent qualitative agreement with experiments, where
available. At the quantitative level, we find differences not only
between calculated and experimental results but also between different
experimental sets.5,37,38 A comparison of experimental results for 2D materials is complicated
by differences in dielectric embedding, presence of defects, and sizes
of the flakes, which cause scatter in the experimental data. In addition
to vibrational properties discussed here, scatter between different
experimental sets is also observed in electronic properties, which
causes a scatter of ≈1 eV in the measured optical band gap
of single-layer phosphorene.9 Hence, benchmark
results free of such experimental complexities, such as ours, are
required.

Our calculated results, combined with experimental
high-spatial-resolution
Raman scattering experiments, aid in a qualitative understanding of
the complicated inhomogeneous and anisotropic strain distributions
in few-layered phosphorene. Since strain is predicted to be an efficient
tuning tool for bandgap2,16 and carrier mobility,28 we expect our results to be of use also for
the manufacture of materials with desired electronic properties via
strain- or layer-engineering.

4 Computational Methods
The structure
of FLP (single to four layers) was represented by
a 5 × 5 supercell with a vacuum of 17 Å included in the z-axis to avoid spurious interactions between periodic images.
All structures were fully optimized using DFT techniques36 as implemented in the VASP code.45,46 In FLP, the van der Waals interlayer interaction
is critical for the description of the interlayer modes. A comparison
with ultra-accurate quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations43 shows that the interlayer interactions both
in bulk and in double-layered BP are very well-described with the
PBE-D239,41 approach, which we have also used in the
present study. It should be noted that none of the DFT models tested
generates charge densities in complete agreement with QMC.43 The important message to be noted with regard
to the QMC-calculated charge densities is that there is absolutely
no interlayer hybridization and, hence, no interlayer chemical bonding
as concluded from the DFT description.11 Instead of hybridization, the interlayer vdW attraction causes Pauli
repulsion between the BP layers.43 A projector
augmented-wave pseudopotential47 with a
plane-wave cutoff of 500 eV and a Monkhosrt–Pack mesh48 of 12 × 8 × 1 was used.

In the
next step, the Raman activities were determined. To reduce
the complex phonon anisotropic behavior,19 unless stated otherwise, the Raman activities Am of the ωm mode were computed as spherical
averages of the Raman tensor of that mode, αm, over
incoming and scattered light-beam polarizations,  with the Raman tensor, αm, being the derivative of the macroscopic dielectric tensor with
respect to the set of atomic displacements that correspond to the
phonon eigenvector.49 The dielectric tensor
components were computed in the linear response theory (DFPT) as implemented
in the VASP code.45,46 The effect of the averaging is that the A modes are significantly
stronger weighted than the B mode. This is because the average is
dominated by the much higher activity of the A modes (see Figure S4). The B mode has higher activities
at angles around 45° where the A modes have low activities, making
activities of all three modes comparable at these angles (see Figure S4). Only vibrational spectra at the Γ
point of the Brillouin zone were considered. The calculation of Raman
activities followed that of Porezag and Pederson50 as implemented in ref (51). The related Raman intensities, which take into
account also the experimental temperature, the exciting frequency
of the laser light, etc., could be calculated from the activity data.52 In either case, a line shape, such as Lorentzian
or Gaussian, has to be imposed, which affects the peak heights.

A compressive/tensile uniaxial in-plane strain was applied both
in the AC and ZZ directions. All strains were applied in the range
of −2 to ≈+6%. These limits were chosen so as to limit
the strain effects on the closure of the HOMO–LUMO gaps in
our DFT description (see the SI and ref (26). In this limited strain
range, Dirac minicones are formed at compressive strains (< −2%)
and indirect gaps are formed in the tensile strain regime. More general
technical details can be found in the SI.

We note that despite limiting our presentation essentially
only
to averaged activities, our database of results contains full angular
information, and any angle-resolved Raman intensity could be reconstructed
and compared with experimental results (for an example, see Figure S4).
