Both the particle
size and compositions have a strong influence
on the UV-shielding performance of layered double hydroxides (LDHs),
and they will interact with each other. To investigate the effects
of divalent metal ions on the UV-shielding properties of layered double
hydroxides (LDHs), MII/MgAl–CO3 LDHs
(M = Mg, Co, Ni, Cu, or Zn) with the same primary and secondary particle
size have been prepared and their UV-shielding performance have been
studied in this work. The UV–vis spectra show that the ZnMgAl-LDHs
exhibit the highest absorbance under the ultraviolet B and ultraviolet
A rays among these LDH samples, but in the ultraviolet C region, the
CuMgAl-LDHs show the highest absorbance and this result is in good
accordance with the UV-shielding performance, which was examined by
protecting the photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B aqueous solution.
Moreover, under UV rays, PP/ZnMgAl-LDH films show excellent resistance
to UV aging, which can be attributed to the strong inhibition of ZnMgAl-LDHs
during the production of free radicals in polypropene, as has been
confirmed by electron spin resonance results.

1 Introduction
Ultraviolet
(UV) irradiation is a part of sunlight. In virtue of
its lower wavelength (UVA: 400–320 nm, UVB: 320–280
nm, and UVC: 280–200 nm) and higher energy (over 3.2 eV per
photon) than the visible light, it is well known that long-term UV
irradiation will cause many problems in practical applications.1,2 For examples, the polymers and coatings will decompose, resulting
in the impairments of their appearance and mechanical properties;
inks and colors can be faded; living organisms including human beings
also can be damaged through excessive exposure to sunlight, which
leads to sunburn and/or skin cancer.3−5 Therefore, materials
with UV-shielding properties are very important for many applications,
and it is very necessary to prepare UV absorbers with excellent UV-shielding
performance.

Generally, there are two types of UV absorbers:
organic and inorganic.6 Organic UV absorbers
are molecules with conjugated
π-electron systems; for example, various derivatives of stilbene
are capable of absorbing UV light. However, organic molecules are
prone to direct photodegradation, migration, and loss in the radical
products, which result in limited protection time.7,8 Inorganic
UV-shielding agents are not decomposed under UV rays and are stable
at neutral pH, thus being suitable for use in UV protection. Therefore,
it is very urgent to search for novel UV absorbers with good stability
and excellent UV light-shielding performances.9−12

Layered double hydroxides
(LDHs) are a class of anionic clay compounds,
consisting of positively charged two-dimensional brucite type host
layers and a negatively charged exchangeable interlayer guest.13,14 The chemical formula of LDHs can be generally described as [M1–x2+Mx3+(OH)2]x+Ann–·mH2O, where M2+, M3+, and An– represent divalent
and trivalent metal cations and interlayer anions, respectively.15,16 Owing to the flexibility of compositional tailoring in the metal
elements and interlayer anions, as well as their unique physical and
chemical properties, such as ion exchange capacity, surface adsorption
capacity, and memory effect, LDHs have been widely used as catalysts,17−19 adsorbents,20−22 nanocomposite hydrogels,23,24 molecular containers,25 polymer additives,26−29 and optical and electrical functional materials.30−35

Recently, MgAl-LDHs have been used as UV-blocking materials,
and
they have been added to polypropene (PP),36,37 poly(ethylene terephthalate),38 poly(methyl
methacrylate),39 polyurethane,40 bitumen,41 and fabric42,43 to improve the anti-UV ability, owing to the virtues of relatively
low photocatalytic performance, being nontoxic, and of low cost compared
with the currently used inorganic UV inhibitors, such as TiO2 and ZnO.37,44 However, the MgAl-LDH filler
tends to be excessively added in the matrix because it shows low absorbance
to UV rays.45 Fortunately, recent studies
have found that the UV-shielding properties of MgAl-LDHs can be further
improved by introducing transition metal elements, such as Zn, Fe,
and Ti.46−48 To optimize the UV-shielding performance and decrease
the additive amount of LDHs, Wang et al.49 have synthesized a series of MgZnAl-LDHs with varying amounts of
zinc ions in the host layers, and the result shows that the extent
of UV absorption increases with the increasing amount of zinc in the
host layers. Shi et al.46 have studied
the UV-shielding mechanism of LDHs, and both the experimental and
theoretical results indicate that the introduction of Zn element is
an effective way to improve the UV-shielding properties of MgAl-LDHs
by tuning the electron structure, band gap, and transition mode. Wang
et al.48 have incorporated Fe3+ into MgAl-LDHs, which efficiently shift their UV absorption to cover
the entire UV range (200–400 nm), and the obtained coating
exhibits excellent stability and long-term UV-shielding performance.
However, there are rare reports that have systematically studied the
influences of divalent metals for the UV-shielding performance of
MgAl-LDHs.

In addition, it is reported that the chemical composition,
physical
morphology, and particle size have a strong influence on the UV-blocking
properties of LDHs.46,48 Cao et al.38 have found that the lateral platelet size of LDHs has a
significant effect on the UV-shielding performance of the nanocomposite
film, and 460 nm-sized LDHs show a much enhanced UV-shielding effect
than 65 nm-sized LDHs. Wang et al.49 have
prepared a series of LDHs with secondary particle size distributions
from 136 to 218 nm, and the UV screening properties of ZnAl-LDHs increases
with the enhancement of the particle size. Unfortunately, most of
the reported literature have typically ignored the size-dependence
effect when investigating the relationship between the UV-shielding
property and chemical/structural parameters of LDH materials.

In this work, to investigate the effect of metal elements on the
UV-blocking performances of LDHs without the disturbance from the
size-effect, MIIMgAl-LDH (M = Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) nanoparticles
with the same primary and secondary particle size have been prepared
by a green and simple method. The structures and UV-shielding performance
of these LDHs were further studied in detail, and the anti-UV ability
of PP/LDH composites has been evaluated. In addition, the UV-blocking
mechanism of PP/LDH composites has been discussed.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structural and Morphological
Characterization
of MII/MgAl-LDHs
Figure 1 shows the X-ray powder diffraction (XRD)
patterns of the as-synthesized MII/MgAl-LDH samples. The
2θ peaks located at 11.6, 23.4, and 34.5° are ascribed
to the diffractions of basal planes of (003), (006), and (009) of
LDHs. There are no peaks of by-products such as metal oxides or metal
hydroxides observed, indicating the purity of the five as-synthesized
LDHs. All of the positions of (003), (006), and (009) diffractions
for five LDH samples are the same. This is because the interlayer
ion for all LDH samples is the carbonate ion, and the c parameter was calculated to be 22.8 Å. The two peaks located
at 60–63° are ascribed to (110) and (113) reflections
for LDHs, and the unequal position of samples is owing to the various
metal ionic sizes of M2+ in the host layer. The unit cell
parameter a of LDHs can be calculated by the formula a = 2d110, and the a parameters
for Mg2Al-LDHs, NiMgAl-LDHs, ZnMgAl-LDHs, CoMgAl-LDHs,
and CuMgAl-LDHs were calculated to be 3.0448, 3.0346, 3.0582, 3.0592,
and 3.0506 Å, respectively. Figure 2 shows that the a parameters
and metal ionic radius of M2+ on the host laminate have
a good linear relationship.50

The metal element of MII/MgAl-LDHs was obtained
by the
inductively coupled plasma (ICP) test, and molar ratios of metal cations
in the layers were calculated from the ICP testing results and are
listed in Table 1.
The MII/Mg2+ ratios for all LDH samples are
close to 1.00, indicating that MII have replaced half of
Mg in the host layer. The water molecule content was obtained by thermogravimetry–differential
scanning calorimetry (TG–DSC) (the results presented in Figure S1), and the chemical composition of MII/MgAl-LDHs are listed in Table 1.

Figure 3 shows the
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the obtained LDH samples.
All of the samples show a strong and broad adsorption band between
3500 and 3100 cm–1, owing to the OH stretching mode
of the hydroxyl groups and the interlayer water molecules, and the
band slightly shift for different samples due to the replacement of
Mg2+ by M2+. The sharp peaks at 1384 and 1500
cm–1 are ascribed to the interlayer carbonate species.44 The bands observed in the low-frequency region
(1000–500 cm–1) are assigned to the vibration
mode of the Al–OH vibration and M–O vibration.51

Scanning electron microscope (SEM)
was carried out to observe the
micromorphology characteristics and platelet diameters of MII/MgAl-LDHs (M = Mg, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn). As shown in Figure 4a–e, MII/MgAl-LDHs
are plate-like, and all samples are well dispersed, and no severe
agglomeration was observed. The diameters of platelets are measured
from the SEM images by counting about 100 nanoparticles, and the diameters
of Mg2Al-LDHs, CoMgAl-LDHs, NiMgAl-LDHs, CuMgAl-LDHs, and
ZnMgAl-LDHs are 63.2 ± 11.5, 61.9 ± 12.0, 60.7 ± 15.7,
53.8 ± 11.1, and 70.9 ± 12.3 nm, respectively, which demonstrates
that all of the LDH samples exhibit the same primary particle size.
In addition, the particle size distributions of the samples are narrow. Figure 5 shows the secondary
particle size distribution of LDHs, measured by a nanoparticle size
analyzer. All of the LDH samples show a narrow size distribution with d0.5 ≈ 150 nm. Combining this with the
results from SEM, it indicates that all of the as-synthesized LDH
samples exhibit the same particle size. As reported in the literature,
the chemical composition and particle size have an influence on the
UV-blocking performance of LDHs.38,49 In consideration
of the fact that all of the as-synthesized LDH samples in this work
exhibit the same primary and secondary particle size, and narrow particle
size distribution; the influence of particles on the UV-blocking performance
can be ignored, which is an essential feature for the study of the
influence of chemical components on the UV-shielding performance of
LDHs without considering the size effects.

2.2 UV-Shielding Performances and Mechanism of
MII/MgAl-LDHs
The UV-shielding performance of
particles is attributed by absorption and scattering.49,52 Therefore, the UV-shielding performance of the LDHs mainly decides
on absorbed energy and the scattering effect on light, and they are
correlated with the intrinsic optical properties and particle size
or morphology of the samples. Since the morphology and the primary
and secondary particle sizes of the five LDHs are similar, their scattering
effect on light is the same, and the UV-shielding difference is mainly
caused by the intrinsic optical properties of LDHs. UV–vis
absorption spectra in an aqueous dispersion (80 mg/L) of MII/MgAl-LDHs (M = Mg, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) were employed to characterize
the optical properties of samples (shown in Figure 6). ZnMgAl-LDHs show high absorbance values
than Mg2Al-LDHs, CoMgAl-LDHs, and NiMgAl-LDHs in the UVB
and UVA regions, but the CuMgAl-LDHs show the highest adsorption in
the UVC region. Table 2 shows the absorbance values of LDH samples by integrating the absorbance
in the wavelength range of 200–400 nm. In the whole UV, UVA,
and UVB regions, the ZnMgAl-LDHs show high absorbance values than
Mg2Al-LDHs, CoMgAl-LDHs, CuMgAl-LDHs, and NiMgAl-LDHs;
however, in the UVC region, the CuMgAl-LDHs show the highest absorbance
value.

To further
evaluate the UV-shielding performance of samples, the
photocatalytic performance of TiO2 to degrade rhodamine
B (RhB) solution was carried out in the presence of 365 nm (UVA),
302 nm (UVB), 254 nm (UVC) light sources under the protection of ethylene-vinyl
alcohol copolymer (EVOH)/LDH films. As shown in Figure 7, the pure EVOH film-protected or not protected
RhB solution showed almost complete degradation after 60 min of irradiation,
while the degradation is slow under the protection of EVOH/LDH films,
indicating that the EVOH/LDH films have excellent UV-shielding efficiency.
In addition, the EVOH/ZnMgAl-LDH film exhibited the best UV-shielding
performance under UVA and UVB rays and the EVOH/CuMgAl-LDHs showed
the best UV-shielding performance under UVC rays, which are in good
accordance with the absorbance intensity result from the UV–vis
absorption spectra.

Polypropylene (PP) is a type of polymer that has been widely
used
in the fields of food, electronic, pharmaceutical, and chemical industries
owing to its high flexibility, good insulation, and low cost. However,
it is unstable under long-term sunlight irradiation, and photostabilizers
or UV-shielding agents must be added to the PP composites. Herein,
the PP has been used as a candidate to test the UV-shielding performance
of LDH samples with different divalent metals; 3 wt % of LDHs were
added to PP by melt blending and pressed into a film with a thickness
of about 50 μm, and the LDH samples were washed with acetone
before being added into PP for the purpose of improving the dispersion
of LDHs in PP.53,54

Figure 8 shows the
FT-IR spectra of pure PP and PP/LDH composite films after different
UV exposure times. The peak at 841 cm–1 is ascribed
to the C–H out-of-plane deformation of −CH3, and the peak at 1724 cm–1 is a characteristic
absorption associated with the carbonyl group of the decomposition
products. After 10 h of UV irradiation, the absorption strength of
PP at 1724 cm–1 gradually increased, but the intensity
of 841 cm–1 was unchanged (as depicted in Figure 8A). The photo-oxidative
degradation mechanism of PP has been widely studied, and the photodegradation
process includes three steps: initiation, propagation, and termination
reactions.55,56 Initiation involves the formation
of an initial radical. A small amount of catalyst residues and groups,
such as carbonyl and hydroperoxide, mixed with commercial PP during
synthesis, processing, and storage. After exposure to UV radiation,
the C–H bond of tertiary carbon was oxidized and undergoes
cleavage, followed by the generation of initial radicals, such as
carbonyl and hydroxy radicals, as well as the breaking of chains.
In the propagation reaction, more and more carbonyl groups and free
radicals were generated accompanied by serious chain breaking. The
termination of photodegradation is achieved by “mopping up”
the free radicals and by the formation of inert products. With the
increase of UV irradiation time, the intensity of the carbonyl group
at 1724 cm–1 increases in Figure 8A,a–f, indicating that pure PP is
rapidly decomposed. Fortunately, the peak of PP/LDH nanocomposites
at 1724 cm–1 shows an unapparent change with irradiation
time compared to the pure PP, indicating that the UV stability of
the PP nanocomposite is improved by adding a small amount of LDHs.

PP/CoMgAl-LDH, (D) PP/NiMgAl-LDH, (E) PP/CuMgAl-LDH, and (F) PP/ZnMgAl-LDH
nanocomposite (3 wt %) films after different UV exposure times (a:
0 h, b: 2 h, c: 4 h, d: 6 h, e: 8 h, and f: 10 h).

To further study the difference in antiaging properties
of different
PP/LDH composites, the internal standard method is used to compare
the behavior of the pure PP and PP/LDH composites. As the intensity
of the peak at 841 cm–1 (C–H out-of-plane
deformation) is unchanged under UV irradiation, it is often used as
a standard peak.57−59 The intensity of the peak at 1724 cm–1 (carbonyl stretching vibration) increases gradually under UV irradiation,
and the absorption intensity ratio I1724/I841 is plotted as a function of aging
time in Figure 9a.
The results clearly show that I1724/I841 increases with irradiation time, but the
change of PP/LDHs is small than pure PP, indicating that the addition
of LDHs significantly improved the photostability of PP, and the aging
of PP was inhibited. Figure 9b shows the I1724/I841 increasing intensity of the pure PP and PP/LDH composites
after 10 h of UV irradiation. The increasing intensity of PP/ZnMgAl-LDH
films (0.10) is less than those of PP/Mg2Al-LDH films (0.38),
PP/CoMgAl-LDH films (0.14), PP/NiMgAl-LDH films (0.27), and PP/CuMgAl-LDH
films (0.37). It shows that ZnMgAl-LDHs are the most advantageous
anti-UV agents in inhibiting PP photoaging.

PP and PP/Mg2Al-LDH, PP/CoMgAl-LDH, PP/NiMgAl-LDH, PP/CuMgAl-LDH
and PP/ZnMgAl-LDH nanocomposite films after different UV exposure
times.

To investigate the mechanism for
photostability of PP/LDHs, the
spin-trapping electron spin resonance (ESR) was employed to monitor
the presence of active radicals in PP/LDH composites. As presented
in Figure 10, all
PP/LDH composites have a signal at about g = 2.000,
and all of the signals increase after 365 nm UV light irradiation
for 10 min, indicating that the fresh PP/LDH composites have unpaired
electrons or radicals, and the amount of the unpaired electrons or
radicals increases under the UV light irradiation. Interestingly,
the increasing intensity of the signal for pure PP, PP/Mg2Al-LDHs, PP/CoMgAl-LDHs, PP/NiMgAl-LDHs, PP/CuMgAl-LDHs, and PP/ZnMgAl-LDHs
is 124, 54, 46, 118, 51, and 5%, respectively. It demonstrates that
the increasing intensity of the ESR signal for PP/LDHs is lower than
that of pure PP, indicating that the presence of LDHs could inhibit
the production of radicals in composites. In addition, the ZnMgAl-LDHs
show the strongest inhibition for the production of radicals in composites,
followed by CoMgAl-LDHs, CuMgAl-LDHs, Mg2Al-LDHs, and NiMgAl-LDHs.
The above results indicate that the LDHs inhibit the production of
radicals in PP and hinder the chain degradation, increasing the antiaging
performance of PP under UV irradiation.

3 Conclusions
To investigate the effect
of metal elements on the UV-blocking
performances of LDHs without the influence of the particle size, MIIMgAl-LDH (M = Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) nanoparticles with the
same primary and secondary particle size have been prepared by a method
involving separate nucleation and aging steps (SNAS). XRD reveals
the relationship between the unit cell parameters and the ionic radius
of the constituent elements of host layers. SEM and particle size
analyses showed that all LDH samples have the same primary and secondary
particle size. The UV–vis spectra and the UV-shielding performance
that was examined by the photocatalytic degradation of RhB aqueous
solution in the presence of TiO2 indicate that the ZnMgAl-LDHs
show the highest shielding performance in the UVB and UVA regions,
but in the UVC region, the CuMgAl-LDHs show the highest shielding
performance. Furthermore, PP/ZnMgAl-LDHs exhibit good photoaging resistance
for UV irradiation. This is because the strong inhibitory effect of
ZnMgAl-LDHs on the production of free radicals in PP under UV irradiation
was confirmed by the ESR tests. Therefore, it is expected that the
ZnMgAl-LDHs show potential practical application as anti-UV agents
for PP as well as for a variety of polymers that are also prone to
UV aging.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Preparation
of LDH Samples
The LDH
samples in this work were synthesized using a method involving separate
nucleation and aging steps (the SNAS method).60 Typically, equal volumes of the salt solution (including 0.4 M MIICl2, 0.4 M MgCl2, and 0.4 M AlCl3; M = Mg, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) and the alkali solution (including
2.4 M NaOH and 0.4 M Na2CO3) were simultaneously
added to the reactor at the same rate of 10 mL/min and obtained the
slurry. To obtain the LDH samples with the same particle size, the
obtained slurry was crystallized at different temperatures for a suitable
period of time under continuous stirring. Mg2Al-LDHs, ZnMgAl-LDHs,
and CoMgAl-LDHs were crystallized at 80 °C for 8 h, NiMgAl-LDHs
were crystallized at 140 °C for 24 h, and CuMgAl-LDHs were crystallized
at 80 °C for 24 h. The products were washed several times with
deionized water until the pH of the supernatant was close to 7. The
products were washed three times with acetone to have a good dispersion
in the polymer and finally dried in an oven at 60 °C.61

4.2 Preparation of EVOH/LDH
and PP/LDH Nanocomposite
Films
EVOH/LDH nanocomposite films prepared by solution casting.62,63 Typically, MIIMgAl-LDH samples were respectively added
into a solution of dimethyl sulfoxide containing 5 wt % of EVOH and
stirred to obtain a homogeneous mixture. The nanocomposite films with
an average thickness of ∼50 μm were then obtained by
drying the homogeneous mixture in a vacuum at 60 °C for 24 h.

PP/LDH nanocomposite films with the weight of LDHs is 3% were prepared
by melt blending. For this, 0.9 g of MIIMgAl-LDHs were
mixed with 30.0 g of PP in a mixer equipped with two counter-rotating
rotors at 180 °C and mixed for about 10 min to produce the corresponding
composite. The obtained composites were melded into a sheet with a
thickness of 50 μm at 180 °C. The pure PP film was also
prepared under the same conditions without the addition of LDHs.

4.3 Characterization
The crystal structure
of the samples was measured using a Dutch PANalytical X’Pert
Pro type X-ray diffractometer (Cu target, Kα ray, λ =
0.15406 nm, scanning speed 5°/min, and diffractions range from
5 to 80°). Elemental analyses were done by inductively coupled
plasma (ICP) emission spectroscopy, and the LDHs were dissolved in
dilute hydrochloric acid before testing. The microstructure of the
sample was measured by a field-emission scanning electron microscope
(Hitachi, SU8010, Japan) with an acceleration voltage of 20 kV. The
particle size of the sample was measured by a nanoparticle size and
ζ-potential analyzer (Malvern, ZS, U.K.). The UV–visible
absorbance curves of the samples were measured using a UV–vis
spectrophotometer (Purkinje, TU1810, China) by dispersing the LDH
samples in water (with the concentration of 80 mg/L). The thermal
properties of LDHs were determined by thermogravimetry and synchronous
thermal analyzers (METTLER-TOLEDO, TGA/DSC 3+, Switzerland) in the
temperature range of 20–700 °C with a heating rate of
5 °C/min in an N2 atmosphere. FT-IR spectra were carried
out using FT-IR spectrometer (Thermo Nicolet, Nexus). The generation
of active radicals in PP composite films before and after UV illumination
was measured by an electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrometer (Bruker,
ER200-SRC-10/12, Germany) with dimethyl pyridine N-oxide (DMPO) as
a spin-trapping reagent in the central magnetic field of 3500.00 G
with a microwave power of 3.99 mW. Subsequently, the films were illuminated
with a UV lamp (λmax = 365 nm) for 10 min and then
tested by the ESR spectrometer again.

4.4 UV-Shielding
Performance Testing of EVOH Nanocomposite
Films
The photodegradation behavior of the RhB solution was
carried out in the presence of TiO2 (Degussa P25) and UV
lamps with different wavelengths (254, 302, and 365 nm) to evaluate
the UV-shielding performance of the EVOH nanocomposite films.63 Briefly, 40 mg of TiO2 were mixed
and completely dispersed into 60 mL of RhB solution (0.01 g/L). Prior
to irradiation, the suspension was stirred in the dark at ambient
temperature for 60 min to achieve an adsorption/desorption equilibrium.
The mouth of the beaker was covered with an EVOH or EVOH/LDH nanocomposite
film prior to UV irradiation. At a given time interval (t), the absorbance at 555 nm for 3 mL of the suspension from which
the photocatalysts were removed was measured by a TU1810 UV–vis
spectrophotometer. The UV-shielding performance of EVOH/LDHs was calculated
as I = At/A0 × 100%, where A0 is
the initial absorbance value of the RhB solution without UV radiation,
and At is the absorbance of the solution
with UV radiation.

4.5 UV Aging Resistance Test
of PP Nanocomposite
Films
Samples of pure PP film and PP/LDH films were rapidly
photoaged in a UV photoaging instrument (a UV high-pressure mercury
lamp as the UV light source, a power of 400 W, and λmax = 340 nm) with a temperature controlling system at 60 °C. Fourier
transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the PP composite films were
recorded after UV irradiation every 120 min.
