Using density functional
theory calculations and photoemission
measurements, we have studied the interaction between the non-fullerene
small-molecule acceptor ITIC and K atoms (a representative of reactive
metals). It is found that the acceptor–donor–acceptor-type
geometric structure and the electronic structure of ITIC largely decide
the interaction process. One ITIC molecule can combine with more than
20 K atoms. For stoichiometries Kx≤6ITIC, the K atoms are attracted to the acceptor units of the molecule
and donate their 4s electrons to the unoccupied molecular orbitals.
K–ITIC organometallic complexes, characterized by the breaking
of some S–C bonds in the donor unit of ITIC and the formation
of K–S bonds, are formed for stoichiometries Kx≥7ITIC. The complexes are still conjugated
despite the breaking of some S–C bonds.

Introduction
Fullerene derivatives such as PC61BM1 and PC71BM2 have
been the most popular electron acceptors used in organic solar cells
(OSCs). However, fullerene derivatives have the drawback of very weak
photoabsorption in the visible and near-infrared regions. Therefore,
a high-performance non-fullerene (NF) acceptor is highly desirable.
In the recent years, many NF small molecule acceptors (SMAs) have
been developed,3−5 among which ITIC6 (see
the molecular structure shown in Figure 1) is the milestone molecule. The OSC based
on ITIC exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 11.21%,7 and the existing more advanced NF-SMAs with higher
efficiency up to 14.1%8−11 are the modifications of ITIC.

diagram of ITIC.

One issue concerning
OSCs and some other organic devices is the
interaction between organic molecules and reactive metals (such as
alkali and alkali earth metals). Reactive metal films have been extensively
adopted as an electrode interlayer for optimizing contact property.12−15 Some metal salts such as LiF,16,17 CsF,17 NaI,18 and CsI18 have also been applied as an electrode interlayer. The
metal atoms of the films or liberated from the salts18 interact with the organic molecules. The interaction can
alter the electronic property of the organic molecules and even degrade
the molecular structures as revealed by some published works. For
example, K atoms donate electrons to CuPc.19 K and Ca atoms not only donate electrons to PC61BM but
also degrade the structure of this molecule.20−23 The molecular structures of P3HT
and MEH-CN-PPV can also be degraded by some reactive metals.24−27

In a previous work,28 we slightly
doped
an ITIC film with Ca atoms to help to understand the X-ray absorption
spectroscopy of ITIC. The electron transfer from Ca atoms to ITIC
was observed. This observation indicates that the interaction between
ITIC and reactive metals deserves careful research. In this work,
we study the interaction between ITIC and K atoms with density functional
theory (DFT) calculations and photoemission (PES) measurements. K
was selected because it is a model-reactive metal. In addition, the
diffusion of K atoms into an organic film is easy as compared with
some other metal atoms such as the Ca atoms. We can thus prepare K-intercalated
ITIC bulk samples for a detailed experimental study of the interaction.
The results reveal that the interaction is electron doping from K
to intact ITIC molecule for stoichiometries Kx≤6ITIC. At higher stoichiometries, the molecular structure
is degraded and organometallic complexes are formed.

Results and Discussion
We first preset the representative DFT results to get an overview
of the K–ITIC interaction. The optimized structure and some
orbital contours of ITIC are shown in Figure 1a. One ITIC molecule has 186 atoms, including
94 C atoms, 4 S atoms, 4 N atoms, 2 O atoms, and the remaining H atoms.
Four hexylphenyl side chains of the molecule are for the purpose of
high solubility in organic solvents and have little relation to the
electronic property. The conjugated main chain has a seven-ring fused
indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IT) core and two
(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (INCN) end groups.
The IT core is the electron donor (D) unit, and the INCN groups are
the electron acceptor (A) units. The D, A units couple strongly as
indicated by the contours of the highest occupied molecular orbital
(HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO); these two
orbitals are distributed both on the D unit and on the A units. As
a whole, ITIC acts as an A–D–A-type electron acceptor.

The contours of the LUMO + 2 and LUMO + 3 are also shown in Figure 1a because the unoccupied
molecular orbitals are much pertinent to the K–ITIC interaction.
These two orbitals are delocalized on the INCN end groups. The LUMO
+ 1 is delocalized on the whole main chain as the case of the LUMO
and thus not shown here. Some energy levels are shown in Figure 1b; the ground-state
HOMO–LUMO gap is 1.193 eV.

Figure 2 shows some
optimized structures of KxITIC (x = 0, 6, 7, 10, and 16). For clarity, the side chains and
the H atoms are hidden. The numbers 1, 1′, ..., 4, 4′
in the structure of ITIC label the eight S–C bonds, some of
which can be broken at high stoichiometries (see below). It is found
that the molecular structure remains intact in the optimization process
of K1–6ITIC, and the K atoms are dragged to the
end groups even if the K atoms are initially placed far from the end
groups (say, near bond 4 or 4′). For K1–5ITIC, there are many isomers. K6ITIC has the unique structure
as shown in Figure 2 because different initial structures result in the same optimized
structure. In all the optimized structures of K1–6ITIC, the Mulliken occupation for each K atom is no less than 0.86 e, indicating that the K 4s electrons are transferred to
ITIC. According to the Mulliken occupation analyses and the orbital
contours, the electrons gained by ITIC are dispersed on the main chain,
filling the delocalized LUMO, LUMO + 1, and LUMO + 2 orbitals of ITIC.
Therefore, the mechanism of the K–ITIC interaction for K1–6ITIC is electron doping, rather than the formation
of local ionic bonds.

Figure 2 Optimized structures of some K–ITIC complexes.
Both the
top views and the side views are shown. The purple balls represent
K atoms. The numbers 1, 1′, ..., 4, 4′ in the structure
of ITIC label the eight S–C bonds. Some S–C bonds are
broken at high stoichiometries.

The molecular structure may or may not be degraded for K7ITIC and K8ITIC. If we place the seventh and/or
eighth
K atom near bond 1 and/or 1′ in the initial structures, the
molecular structure is degraded. One optimized structure of K7ITIC with degraded molecular structure is shown in Figure 2. The length of bond
1 in this structure is 3.368 Å, in comparison with the bond length
of 1.781 Å in the pristine ITIC. Therefore, bond 1 and the related
thiophene ring are broken. The Mulliken occupation is −0.701 e for the S atom of the broken thiophene ring, versus −0.037 e for this S atom in the pristine ITIC; the Mulliken occupation
for the seventh K atom is 0.795 e. Therefore, ion
bonds are formed between the S atom and its nearby K atoms; a K7ITIC complex forms. If we place the seventh and/or eighth
K atom far from bond 1 and/or 1′ in the initial structures,
however, the molecular structure remains intact. The Mulliken occupations
of the seventh and eighth K atoms are still rather large (>0.8 e) in the structures with intact ITIC. This can be understood
with the energy-level structure shown in Figure 1b. The LUMO + 3 is only slightly higher than
the LUMO + 2 in energy and can accommodate the electrons transferred
from the seventh and eighth K atoms, provided that the seventh and
eighth K atoms are far from the most fragile S–C bonds 1 and
1′.

More S–C bonds can be broken at higher stoichiometries.
For a specific stoichiometry, the number of broken S–C bonds
depends on the positions of the K atoms in the initial structures.
We show an optimized structure of K10ITIC with two broken
S–C bonds and an optimized structure of K16ITIC
with six broken S–C bonds in Figure 2. It is found that bonds 4 and 4′
never break until K20ITIC (stoichiometries higher than
K20ITIC were not calculated because they are too time-consuming),
and thus the breaking of six S–C bonds corresponds to the detachment
of two S atoms from the main chain. The detached S atoms are still
part of the complexes because of the K–S bonds. According to
the DFT calculations, K16ITIC is the lowest stoichiometry
that can have the most (six) broken S–C bonds. Of course, K16ITIC isomers with fewer broken S–C bonds exist. We
can even obtain the optimized structures of K20ITIC with
only four S–C bonds broken.

The average Mulliken occupation
for the 16 K atoms in the K16ITIC structure shown in Figure 2 is 0.712 e, and the smallest
Mulliken occupation is 0.638 e. The Mulliken occupation
for the four S atoms lies between −0.731 and −1.110 e. Therefore, the K–ITIC interaction and the K–S
ion bonds are rather strong. In some other structures, especially
those structures with stoichiometries higher than K16ITIC,
the Mulliken occupation of some K atoms is smaller than 0.5 e. For example, the Mulliken occupations for some K atoms
in many K20ITIC isomers are 0.2–0.5 e. The interaction between these K atoms and the ITIC molecule is
weak but non-negligible. It seems that one ITIC molecule can combine
with more than 20 K atoms.

Except the breaking of some S–C
bonds, the remaining parts
of ITIC are stable against the attack of the K atoms. The skeleton
of the K7–20ITIC complexes is still conjugated (alternating
C–C and C=C bonds in the main chain) as examined for
all the optimized structures including those not shown here.

To sum up, the DFT calculations afford five conclusions about the
K–ITIC interaction. (1) The K atoms first combine with the
end groups. (2) The molecular structure of ITIC remains intact at
least until the stoichiometry of K6ITIC. (3) Some S–C
bonds break and K–ITIC complexes are form above a certain stoichiometry.
(4) S–C bonds 4 and 4′ never break until K20ITIC. (5) The mechanisms for the K–ITIC interaction are the
electron transfer from K to ITIC and the formation of K–S ion
bonds.

Generally, DFT results should be checked by basic physical
and
chemical considerations or experimental data. The first DFT conclusion
can be easily understood by the A–D–A-type molecular
structure: the INCN end groups are electron acceptor units. The second
DFT conclusion can be easily understood by the electronic structure
of ITIC. The LUMO and LUMO + 1 are delocalized on the entire main
chain. The LUMO + 2 is not so extended as the LUMO and LUMO + 1 but
still delocalized on the INCN end groups. Therefore, the electrons
(transferred from the six K atoms) filling these orbitals are dispersed
and cannot much affect a specific bond of ITIC. The third and fourth
DFT conclusions, together with the formation of K–S bonds mentioned
in conclusion (5), cannot be readily understood and need experimental
verifications. The electron transfer, if observed directly, would
solidly support other conclusions. In the following, we present and
discuss the PES data. The density of state (DOS) curves calculated
on the optimized structures shown in Figure 2 will be compared with the PES data.

Figure 3a shows
the K 2p and C 1s PES. The spectra of the two core levels were measured
simultaneously in the experiments, and the background region (from
289 to 292 eV) between them is hidden for clarity. We estimated the
sample stoichiometries based on the intensity ratios between the K
2p and C 1s PES, taking the number (94) of C atoms of ITIC and the
photoionization cross sections29 into consideration.
The highest stoichiometry was determined to be K29.7ITIC.
Considering the previous DFT calculations, such a high stoichiometry
is not a surprise, although there may be some extra K atoms on the
sample surface. The variation from spectrum 11 to spectrum 12 is very
small, indicating that the intercalation reaches saturation or at
least is very near saturation in the detection depth of the core-level
PES measurements. The detection depth is generally several nanometers
for organic samples, although the definite value is unknown.

Figure 3 (a) K 2p and
C 1s PES. The values of x indicate
the estimated K/ITIC number ratios of the samples. The spectral lines
are normalized to the intensity of the C 1s signal. (b) C 1s DOS curves
of ITIC, K6ITIC, and K10ITIC. The black, blue,
and red lines represent the total DOS, the LDOS of the main chain,
and the LDOS of the side chains, respectively.

The K 2p PES is only for estimating the sample stoichiometries
and will not be discussed further. The C 1s PES exhibits three notable
characteristics: a long tail extending to ∼288 eV in the spectrum
of the pristine ITIC (spectrum 1), the steady movements toward higher
binding energy (BE) with more intercalation of K atoms, and a shoulder
emerging at the lower BE side of the main peak for spectra 6–12
(indicated by the dashed line shown in Figure 3a). As seen below, these characteristics
coincide with the DOS curves calculated on the structures shown in Figure 2 and thus support
the DFT conclusions.

Figure 3b shows
the C 1s DOS curves of ITIC, K6ITIC, and K16ITIC as representatives. The C 1s states of the main chain (the blue
line) separate in energy from that of the side chains (the red line)
with a minor overlap for ITIC. This is the reason why spectrum 1 shown
in Figure 3a exhibits
a long tail at ∼288 eV. The tail is mainly the PES from the
main chain, while the main peak at 284.65 eV is mainly from the side
chains. The signal from the main chain is rather weak although the
number (46) of C atoms in the main chain is comparable with that (48)
in the side chains. This may be due to that the delocalized π
electrons of the main chain attenuate the C 1s signal.

In accord
with the peak movement from spectrum 1 to spectrum 6
shown in Figure 3a,
the DOS curves of K6ITIC move distinctly to lower energy
(higher BE) because of the Fermi-level shift caused by the electron
transfer from K to ITIC. For K16ITIC, the DOS curve of
the states of the side chains (corresponding to the experimental main
peak) moves slightly to still higher BE, coinciding with the movements
of the main peaks of spectra 7–12 shown in Figure 3a.

With the electron
transfer from K to ITIC, the C 1s states of the
main chain exhibits chemical shifts to higher energy (lower BE), in
addition to the movements to higher BE caused by the Fermi-level shift.
The energy positions of the C 1s states of the side chains are less
affected by the effect of chemical shift and mainly decided by the
Fermi-level shift. For the DOS curves of K6ITIC, nearly
half of the C 1s states of the main chain move to the right side of
the C 1s states of the side chains, which corresponds to the emergence
of a shoulder at the lower BE side of the main peak observed for spectrum
6 shown in Figure 3a. With more K atoms combined with ITIC, more C 1s states of the
main chain move to the right side of the C 1s states of the side chains,
as can be seen from the DOS curves of K16ITIC. Correspondingly,
the C 1s PES exhibits an increasingly strong shoulder from spectrum
6 to spectrum 12 shown in Figure 3a. It seems that the PES from the main chain becomes
stronger at high intercalation stages as compared with the case of
the pristine ITIC, but the reason for this is unknown at present.
According to the comparison between the DOS curves and the PES data,
the sample of spectrum 6 shown in Figure 3a corresponds to a stoichiometry not far
from K6ITIC. The nominal stoichiometry of this sample is
K6.8ITIC. Therefore, our estimate of the stoichiometries
for the experimental samples is generally reliable.

The S 2p
PES shown in Figure 4a provides direct evidence of the breaking of some
S–C bonds. The pristine ITIC exhibits the well-separated spin–orbit
doublet 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, and the doublet is
labeled I. There are two other sets of S 2p doublets in the figure,
which are labeled II and III. Doublet I disappears completely in the
top two spectra. Doublets II and III emerge at the intercalation stages
of spectra 3 and 7, respectively, and persist until the intercalation
saturation. The chemical shift from doublet I to doublet II is as
large as −2.80 (=162.60–165.40) eV according to spectrum
7. The chemical shift from doublet II to doublet III is −1.95
(=160.95–162.90) eV according to spectrum 12. The large and
negative chemical shifts not only verify the breaking of some S–C
bonds but also verify the formation of K–S bonds in which the
S atoms gain electrons from the K atoms.

Figure 4 (a) S 2p PES normalized
to spectral intensity. (b) S 2p DOS curves
of ITIC, K6ITIC, K7ITIC, K10ITIC,
and K16ITIC. The symbols of I, II, and III indicate three
types of S atoms.

The three sets of S 2p
doublets coincide with the structures shown
in Figure 2. The S
atoms in those structures can be classified into three types: the
S atoms in intact thiophene rings (type I), the S atoms in the S–C
bond of a broken thiophene ring (type II), and the S atoms detached
from the main chain (type III). In the DFT calculations, we have found
that bonds 4 and 4′ do not break up to the stoichiometry of
K20ITIC, giving identical numbers of type II and type III
S atoms in some structures such as the K16ITIC structure
shown in Figure 2.
The intensities of doublets II and III are near identical in spectrum
(12) shown in Figure 4a, indicating that the number of type II S atoms is identical to
that of type III S atoms. Therefore, bonds 4 and 4′ do not
break until the intercalation saturation (the corresponding stoichiometry
is greater than K20ITIC), making up for the lack of the
DFT calculations.

After six S–C bonds have been broken,
there is no intact
thiophene ring in the complexes (see, e.g., the K16ITIC
structure shown in Figure 2). Therefore, doublet I disappears in the top two spectra
shown in Figure 4a.
The breaking of the thiophene rings starts at the stoichiometry of
K7ITIC according to the DFT calculations, while the experimental
signal of type II S atoms can be observed on the sample of K2.2ITIC (spectrum 3). This is because the experimental sample is not
homogeneous. The nominal stoichiometries indicated in Figure 4a are averaged stoichiometries,
and the concentration of K in a sample is not uniform. It is possible
that a very small fraction of K7ITIC is present in the
sample of nominal K2.2ITIC. Doublet II persists to the
intercalation saturation because S–C bonds 4 and 4′
never break.

The correspondence between the experimental doublets
and the calculated
three types of S atoms is more straightforward in comparison with
the S 2p PES with the DOS curves. Figure 4b shows the S 2p DOS curves calculated on
the optimized structures shown in Figure 2. The spin–orbit coupling has not
been implemented in the DMol3 package, and thus each DOS peak corresponds
to an experimental doublet. Fine structures or asymmetric shapes for
some DOS peaks are due to different chemical environment of the S
atoms belonging to the same type. The highest stoichiometry is K16ITIC shown in Figure 4b, which is much smaller than the highest stoichiometry of
the experimental samples. However, as mentioned previously, all the
six S–C bonds that can be broken have been broken in this structure.
Therefore, Figure 4b can be compared with the S 2p PES from the pristine ITIC to the
intercalation saturation. The assignments (I, II, and III) of the
DOS peaks to the three types of S atoms are based on local DOS (LDOS)
analyses. It can be seen that Figure 4b shows a good correspondence compared with Figure 4a.

For quantitative
comparison of the experimental and calculated
chemical shifts, one can concentrate on one peak, either the 2p3/2 or the 2p1/2, of the experimental doublet. The
chemical shift from type I to type II is rather large (−2.16
or −1.90 eV), as shown in Figure 4b, although smaller than the experimental
value of −2.8 eV. The quantitative agreement is not bad considering
the DFT calculations performed for specific stoichiometries of isolated
complexes (as compared with the mixed phases and the solid state for
an experimental sample). The chemical shift from type II to type III
is −2.07 eV, as shown in Figure 4b, comparable with the experimental value of −1.95
eV.

N 1s and O 1s PES measured for a few intercalation stages
(not
shown here) also coincide with the DFT results. The O 1s PES exhibited
a weak oxidation signal for the samples at high intercalation stages;
the slight oxidation had no effect on the spectra shown in Figures 3 and 4.

For observing the electron transfer from K to ITIC,
we measured
(with hν = 21.2 eV) one valence state spectrum
on the sample of K29.7ITIC. More valence state spectra
were measured on another K-intercalated ITIC film (the valence state
samples). All these valence state spectra are shown in Figure 5. For the valence state samples,
we measured the K 2p and C 1s core-level PES only after the last intercalation
round, and the stoichiometry was estimated to be K9.1ITIC.
The stoichiometries for the samples of spectra 2–7 are unknown
because we did not measure the corresponding K 2p and C 1s PES to
avoid sample oxidation caused by too long experimental time (very
slight oxidation could much affect the valence state spectra). Therefore,
we indicate the electric current through the K evaporation source
and the deposition time for each intercalation round in the figure.
We did not intercalate the valence state samples to saturation because
the spectra shown in Figure 5 have been sufficient for observing the electron transfer.

Figure 5 Valence
state PES. Spectrum (9) was measured on the sample of K29.7ITIC shown in Figure 4a. The other spectra were measured on another ITIC
film with the highest stoichiometry of K9.1ITIC; the electric
current through the K evaporation source and the deposition time for
each intercalation round are indicated. The spectra are normalized
to the height of feature C.

Spectrum 1 of the pristine ITIC film exhibits four features,
which
are labeled A, B, C, and D. Feature A corresponds to the HOMO level
of the pristine ITIC according to the valence state DOS curve (not
shown here). Upon the intercalation of K, a new feature, which is
labeled E, emerges between feature A and the Fermi level (Ef). For clarity, the signal near the Fermi level
is magnified by 16 times (spectra 1–3) or 8 times (spectra
4–9) in the figure. Feature E is the direct evidence of the
electron transfer.

The intensity of feature E increases monotonically
from spectra
2–5, corresponding to more electrons filling the unoccupied
molecular orbitals of intact ITIC. The intensity decreases slightly
for spectrum 6, indicating the degradation of some molecules at this
intercalation stage. After the degradation of the molecules, the intensity
of feature E does not necessarily increase monotonically with more
intercalation of K. Spectrum 9 has the characters (five features A–E
and their energy positions) in line with the overall evolution trend
shown in Figure 5,
indicating that a conjugated skeleton exists until the intercalation
saturation.

To sum up, the PES data shown in Figures 3–5 verify the
DFT conclusions and make up for the deficiency of the DFT calculations
performed only for Kx≤20ITIC.

The results about the K–ITIC interaction have many implications
to designing high-performance electrode interfaces for ITIC-based
devices. For a metal salt interlayer (between ITIC and the electrode),
the number of the released metal atoms from the salt may be not large
enough to degrade the molecular structure, but the released metal
atoms can alter the electronic property of ITIC through electron transfer.
The altered electronic property needs further study. When reactive
metal film is adopted as an electrode interlayer, one worries about
the degradation of the molecular structure. Our results imply that
the molecular skeleton of metal–ITIC complexes may be still
conjugated and assure effective charge transport for some other reactive
metals; these metals can then be adopted as interlayers. In this respect,
further works are needed to study the detail of the interaction between
ITIC and other reactive metals such as Ca, Ba, and Mg. Interfacial
electronic states are crucial for the performance of the devices.
The electronic states at the interface between ITIC and a metal film
interlayer should be rather complicated because of the electron transfer
and molecular degradation, and great efforts are desirable to obtain
the detail of the electronic states.

Conclusions
Six
first arrived K atoms are dragged to the end groups (the acceptor
units of ITIC) and donate their 4s electrons to the delocalized unoccupied
molecular orbitals. The molecular structure is intact at least for
the stoichiometries of K6ITIC and may keep intact until
K8ITIC. Then, the subsequently arrived K atoms interact
with the IT core (the donor unit of ITIC) and break some S–C
bonds. The two S–C bonds mostly near the molecular center (bonds
4 and 4′), however, never break. After the breaking of one
or more S–C bonds, K–S ion bonds and the corresponding
K–ITIC complexes are formed. The complexes are still conjugated.

Computational
and Experimental Methods
Computational Details
DFT calculations
were performed
with the DMol3 package.30,31 We constructed and
optimized many KxITIC (x = 0–20) structures. The distances between a K atom and the
atoms of ITIC were assured to be greater than the sum of the ionic
radius of K and the atomic radius of the other atoms in the initial
structures. The energy levels, orbital contours, Mulliken occupancy
numbers, and DOSs were calculated for the optimized structures. We
adopted the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)-generalized
gradient approximation functional32 and
the double numerical basis sets plus polarization function (DNP) in
the calculations. The PBE functional and the DNP basis set have been
adopted in the study of K–PC61BM interaction,22 which generated results coinciding excellently
with PES spectra. The convergence criteria for the structural optimization
are 10–6 Ha on the energy, 10–4 Ha/Å on the gradient, and 10–3 Å on
the displacement. Self-consistent field procedures were carried out
with a convergence criterion of 10–6 Ha on the energy
and electron density.

Experimental Details
PES measurements
were carried
out at the Photoelectron Spectroscopy Endstation of the Beijing Synchrotron
Radiation Facility. ITIC (purity > 99%, Solenne company) films
were
spin-coated on HF-etched Si/H(111) substrates in a N2-filled
glovebox. The thickness of the films was ∼100 nm as calibrated
previously by atomic force microscopy. The time exposed to air was
less than 30 s before the ITIC films were transported into the vacuum
chamber of the spectrometer. We started to measure the spectra of
the pristine ITIC films after the samples had been left in the ultrahigh
vacuum environment (2 × 10–10 mbar) for more
than 8 h. Before K intercalation, the samples were heated at 120 °C
for 30 min. No change of spectral shape could be observed, indicating
the clean samples even before the heating.

K intercalation was
performed in a stepwise manner with an SAES getter source located
at 11 cm from the sample surface. During the deposition of the K atoms,
the ITIC films were kept at room temperature. The concentration of
K deep in the samples may be smaller than that in the surface region
because of the absence of annealing at elevated temperatures. However,
such samples are competent for our research purpose. We intercalated
two ITIC films, one for core-level measurements (with the photon energy
of 700.0 eV) and the other for valence state measurements (with the
photon energy of 21.2 eV). The core-level measurements were time-consuming.
We measured the valence state PES on another film for worrying about
sample oxidation caused by too long experimental time.

A Gammadata
Scienta R4000 analyzer was used to collect the photoelectrons
in a solid angle of ±19° with respect to sample normal.
The 4f7/2 core-level PES of a Au film (deposited on the
sample holder just before the measurements) was frequently recorded
for checking the photon energies. The overall energy resolution of
the spectra was 0.7 eV for the core-level measurements and 0.05 eV
for the valence state measurements. In the core-level measurements,
K 2p, C 1s, and S 2p PES were measured for every stage of the sample
preparation history. For reducing the experimental time and avoiding
sample oxidation, we measured N 1s and O 1s PES only for a few intercalation
stages.
