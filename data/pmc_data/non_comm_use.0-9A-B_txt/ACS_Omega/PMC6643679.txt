In
this work, we take advantage of the parallel organization of
cellulose chains in cellulose I yielding an inherent chemical asymmetry
of cellulose nanocrystals, i.e., reducing vs nonreducing end, to selectively
modify only one end of these rigid rodlike crystals to be used as
a linking point for the formation of supramolecular structures. We
have prepared biotin-functionalized tunicate cellulose nanocrystals
at the reducing end capable of forming new complex supramolecular
hierarchies by the addition of the protein streptavidin. Biotin–streptavidin
coupling was chosen because streptavidin has a multivalency of four
and the biotin–streptavidin bond is known to be highly selective
and stable. Hence, streptavidin molecules would link up to four cellulose
nanocrystals through their biotin-modified reducing end. Two biotin
derivatives were studied, consisting of an anchoring group, i.e.,
amine or hydrazine; the biotin moiety; and the linker between them.
Results show that the length of the linker significantly affects the
bond between the biotinylated cellulose nanocrystals and streptavidin,
and a certain chain length is necessary for the supramolecular assembly
of several cellulose nanocrystals by streptavidin.

Introduction
Nanocelluloses have
emerged as unique nanomaterials obtained from
the most abundant natural polymer available in Nature.1,2 Cellulose is present in a wide variety of living species, such as
animals, plants, and bacteria.3 It can
be considered a structural polymer that supports life and has demonstrated
intrinsic performance properties derived from the arrangement of the
cellulose macromolecules into the supramolecular crystalline structures
during cell wall formation.4 Cellulose
is a linear polymer composed of β-(1–4)-linked d-glucose units arranged in a parallel highly crystalline cellulose
I structure. The presence of three hydroxyl groups and C–H
bonds in each glucose unit leads to the formation of intra- and intermolecular
strong hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions that promote
parallel stacking of multiple cellulose chains forming elementary
fibrils that further aggregate into larger microfibrils.3,5 Cellulose fibers are composed of highly crystalline domains and
amorphous regions; the latter can be hydrolyzed by acid to isolate
rodlike cellulose nanocrystals (CNC).6 The
CNC can be viewed as rigid crystallites of high aspect ratio (defined
as the length-to-width, L/w) whose
dimensions are around 5–20 nm in width (w)
and 50–2000 nm in length (L), depending on
their biological origin. Hence, cotton CNC are 5–10 nm in width
and no more than 500 nm in length, bacterial cellulose are crystallites
of 10–20 nm in width and 500–1000 nm in length, and
nanocrystals from tunicate present width of around 5–30 nm
and length of several microns.7−9

As nanocelluloses, cellulose
nanocrystals have shown unique properties
such as strengthening effect and good mechanical and barrier properties
to be exploited as reinforcing agents in nanocomposites, paper making,
packaging, coating additives, rheological modifiers, membranes, or
gas barriers.7,8,10 Furthermore,
they act as emulsion stabilizers in a wide variety of applications
including paintings, cosmetics, and food industry, among others.11 Other interesting properties of cellulose nanocrystals
include transparency, low thermal expansion, and optical properties.6,7

A particular feature of the structure of nanocelluloses is
the
inherent directionality of cellulose chains, i.e., nonreducing end
(C4–OH) vs reducing end (C1=O). The different reactivity
of hemiacetals compared to hydroxyl groups makes them an interesting
experimental platform for the selective introduction of the desired
functionalities at the reducing end of the nanocelluloses, creating
nano-objects with chemically differentiated ends. At present, very
few studies have focused on site-specific modification of nanoparticles.12−15 Hence, Lokanathan et al. selectively introduced thiol groups at
the reducing ends of cellulose nanocrystals, which allowed the controlled
coupling to silver nanoparticles or the chemisorption onto gold surfaces
by the reducing end.13,14 Also, Yang et al. have employed
click chemistry as a strategy for the end-to-end assembly of cellulose
nanocrystals to form nanofibers.16 Indeed,
polymer chains have been introduced at cellulose reducing ends by
both “grafting to” and “grafting from”
methods.12 In a recent publication, Zoppe
et al. succeeded in polymerizing different monomers tethered at the
reducing ends of cellulose nanocrystals by atom transfer radical polymerization.15 Therefore, asymmetric functionalization seems
to be an efficient strategy for precise manipulation of the way rigid
rodlike cellulose crystals assemble with each other and with other
components.

In this work, we report the selective introduction
of biotin functionality
at the reducing end of CNC by the carbodiimide-mediated reaction.
The method involves oxidation of carbonyl groups and their subsequent
nucleophilic attack by amine-containing biotin derivatives. Biotin
is a small molecule (244.31 Da) that has a strong affinity for the
tetravalent protein streptavidin (SAV). The biotin–streptavidin
association is highly specific and stable and the strongest known
noncovalent interaction between protein and ligand (Ka ≈ 1015 L mol–1).17 Streptavidin is a ≈56 kDa homotetramer
with subunits arrayed in D2 symmetry that
can act as a multivalent linker capable of complexing up to four biotin
molecules. The aim of this work is therefore the precise association
of biotin-functionalized tunicate cellulose nanocrystals (t-CNC) by
adding streptavidin. Confirmation of the topochemical nature of biotinylation
to produce asymmetric nanoparticles that assemble by streptavidin
was assessed by quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D),
dynamic light scattering (DLS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM).

Results
and Discussion
t-CNC Characterization
Among the
available cellulose
nanocrystals, we focused on tunicate cellulose nanocrystals (t-CNC)
because of their high aspect ratio (approximately 50–100) and
rather homogeneous length distribution compared to cotton or wood
cellulose nanocrystals.6 The t-CNCs were
obtained from Styela clava through
a treatment consisting of cooking, bleaching, and acid hydrolysis
(see Experimental Section). Because they are
negatively charged due to the presence of sulfate groups introduced
during acid hydrolysis, the obtained t-CNCs formed stable colloidal
suspensions in water. The stability of the t-CNC colloidal dispersions
was confirmed by the value of ζ-potential (−12.4 ±
2.4 mV), comparable to the values reported in literature for tunicate
nanocrystals prepared by acid hydrolysis,18 which indicated the repulsion between adjacent, similarly negatively
charged nanocrystals in water suspension.19 The average Z-size obtained by dynamic light scattering
(DLS) was 200.5 ± 8.1 nm. The surface charge density, calculated
by conductometric titration (Figure S1),
was 0.022 ± 0.001 mmol g–1, according to the
values previously reported for cellulose nanocrystals.18

The morphology and structural features
of the t-CNCs were evaluated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
and atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Figure 1). The t-CNCs appeared as long rodlike nanocrystals
and were well individualized; there was no evidence of large-scale
aggregation, as previously described.9,18 The accurate
measurement of the t-CNC dimensions by AFM was difficult because nanocrystals
formed a network onto the mica substrate and both ends were not clearly
identified. A detailed analysis of the TEM images revealed an average
length of 1360 ± 630 nm and an average width of 10.6 ± 3.1
nm, which resulted in an aspect ratio, defined as the length-to-width
(L/w) of 130, according to the previously
described dimensions for tunicate cellulose nanocrystals.6,9Figure 1 Morphology

electron microscopy (TEM) (a) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) (b).



Introduction of Biotin
Functionality at the Reducing Ends of
t-CNC
The reaction of introduction of the biotin moiety at
the reducing ends of t-CNCs and the structures of the two biotin derivatives
studied are shown in Scheme 1. At first, the reducing ends were oxidized to carboxylic
acids and then, the biotin functionality was introduced by a covalent
amide bond after NHS–EDC activation. Two different biotin-functionalized
molecules were investigated for the introduction of the biotin moiety
at the t-CNC reducing ends (Scheme 1): (+)-biotinamidohexanoic acid hydrazide (HC-Biot),
which consists of the biotin functionality amide-linked to a hydrazide
by a 6-carbon aliphatic chain; and biotin-dPEG7-NH2 (PEG-Biot),
in which the biotin is amide-linked to an amine by a poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG) chain of seven repeating units. The elemental composition
of the reaction products after oxidation and biotin introduction is
compiled in Table 1. Elemental analysis was preferably used because chemical modification
of the reducing ends represented a very low amount of new chemical
groups in the structure that cannot be detected by spectroscopy techniques
(see discussion below) compared to the polymer adsorption or modification
of hydroxyl groups along the nanocrystal surface.20 As unmodified t-CNCs were devoid of nitrogen, elemental
analysis allowed the detection of the biotin and amide groups. Similar
strategies have been recently used successfully for the characterization
of low-density modification of cellulose nanofibrils by poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG) moieties through NHS–EDC coupling,21 or the polymerization of N-isopropylacrylamide,
[2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]trimethylammonium chloride, or sodium 4-vinylbenzenesulfonate
at the reducing ends of cellulose nanocrystals.15Scheme 1 Schematic Illustration of the Synthetic Protocol Used to Introduce

Both biotin-functionalized t-CNCs
showed higher nitrogen contents
compared to the starting t-CNCs or oxidized t-CNCs. In fact, the very
low nitrogen content of t-CNC and t-CNC–COOH was insignificant
taking into account the detection limits of the instrument. Even if
the nitrogen content was not statistically different between the samples
(analysis of variance, Tukey post-test, P 0.05),
results suggested a higher content of nitrogen in the case of biotin-functionalized
nanocrystals. According to the carbon–nitrogen ratio, for t-CNC–HC-Biot,
there was a molecule of biotin for each 2800 glucose molecules, and
for t-CNC–PEG-Biot, the ratio is one biotin per 4000 glucoses,
which suggested that several biotin molecules could be introduced
at the t-CNC reducing end. Concerning the sulfur content, the introduction
of a sulfur atom present in the biotin structure was not detected
by elemental analysis because the variation was under the detection
limit. The preparation of t-CNCs involves the hydrolysis of tunicate
fibers by sulfuric acid, which confers negatively charged half ester
sulfate groups to the t-CNC surface. According to Table 1, the sulfur content did not
change significantly upon oxidation or amide coupling, which indicated
that the sulfate groups are not removed during reactions.

Figure S2 shows the Fourier-transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra of the oxidized t-CNC and both biotin-functionalized
t-CNC in comparison to unmodified t-CNC. The FTIR spectrum of unmodified
t-CNCs (bottom trace) revealed typical cellulose structural characteristics.18,22 After oxidation, the spectrum did not show the C=O stretching
band from acid (COOH) at 1730 cm–1.23 Similarly, the presence of the C=O stretching from
amide I bonding at 1645 cm–1 or the C–N stretching
and N–H deformation from amide II at 1545 cm–124 were not detected in both biotin-functionalized
t-CNCs. The absence of these bands is unsurprising according to the
elemental analysis data that showed a very small number of COOH or
amide bonds introduced at the t-CNC reducing end. Previous studies
have revealed that a higher number of functional groups (such as in
the modification of hydroxyl groups along the nanocrystals surface,
or in the case of the introduction of polymers instead of single molecules)
are necessary for the detection of such groups by FTIR.20 In the case of biotin-functionalized t-CNCs,
a small signal from the amide bonds would be overlapped with the band
at 1635 cm–1 corresponding to the symmetric deformation
vibration of the adsorbed water molecules.25

From the FTIR spectra, the crystalline order of cellulose
chains
within the nanocrystal can be estimated by the calculation of the
lateral order and the total crystalline indexes. The lateral order
index (LOI) expresses the degree of order and therefore gives information
of crystalline modifications.26 It
is defined as the ratio of the band at 1430 cm–1 to the band at 895 cm–1. The band at 1430 cm–1 is attributed to the CH2 symmetric bending
or scissoring motion at C(6), and it is known to be very sensitive
to changes in conformation. On the other hand, the band at 895 cm–1, ascribed to C(1) vibrations, is not affected by
changes in crystallinity.27 The total crystalline
index (TCI)28 is the ratio of the absorption
peaks at 1372 cm–1 (−CH bending) to the peak
at 2900 cm–1, ascribed to the C(6) vibration of
hydroxymethyl group from the crystalline form of cellulose Iβ. Table S1 shows the values of LOI and
TCI for unmodified, oxidized, and biotin-functionalized t-CNC. There
was no significant difference between LOI values (3.33–3.82)
and TCI values (0.91–0.99) of modified and unmodified t-CNCs,
which suggested that the crystalline structure of t-CNCs was not significantly
modified by the functionalization at the reducing ends.

Assembly of
Biotin-Functionalized t-CNCs by Streptavidin (SAV)
The binding affinity between biotin and streptavidin
was used as a strategy for assembling several t-CNCs by their reducing
ends. Streptavidin (SAV) has four binding sites per molecule and the
streptavidin–biotin complex is one of the strongest bindings
that only dissociates in harsh conditions, such as high temperature
or formamide treatments.29 The binding
energy derives from different contributions of noncovalent interactions
between biotin and streptavidin. There are three binding features
critical to the strength of the streptavidin–biotin interaction:
(i) hydrophobic van der Waals interaction forces arising from tryptophan
contacts to biotin, (ii) a large number of specific hydrogen bonds,
and (iii) a flexible surface loop of streptavidin moving to a close
conformation when biotin is bound to its site inside the β-barrel
of the streptavidin molecule.30,31 Biotin is therefore
confined in the active site of streptavidin by hydrogen bonds and
van der Waals interactions among nonpolar groups. The binding of biotin-functionalized
t-CNCs was investigated by quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation
(QCM-D). The objective of this set of experiments was to demonstrate
the selective binding of biotin-functionalized t-CNCs to SAV surfaces,
similar to the chemisorption of thiol-functionalized cellulose nanocrystals
to gold surfaces described by Lokanathan et al.,13 so that t-CNCs functionalized at reducing ends would adsorb
by one end and repel each other by electrostatic interaction between
sulfate groups.

Tunicate nanocrystals (unmodified or biotin-functionalized)
did not deposit onto uncoated QCM-D gold substrates because the sulfate
groups prevented the adsorption onto negatively charged gold surfaces.
Therefore, no change in frequency or dissipation was observed (Figure S3). Once discarded the unspecific adsorption
on gold, streptavidin was deposited onto gold substrates and the changes
in frequency and dissipation were monitored upon time. When streptavidin
was deposited from water solutions at pH 5–6, unspecific adsorption
of both unmodified and biotin-modified t-CNCs was observed (Figure S4). The pI of streptavidin is around
5–6;32 therefore, the protein was
close to its isoelectric point, and both unmodified and biotin-functionalized
t-CNCs could be adsorbed by electrostatic interactions between their
charged sulfate groups and the SAV layer. To prevent the unspecific
t-CNC adsorption, streptavidin was deposited at pH 7 so that the SAV
layer will be negatively charged. Figure 2 shows the changes in frequency and dissipation
of SAV-coated surfaces at pH 7 upon the injection of unmodified and
biotin-functionalized t-CNCs.

Figure 2 Frequency (Δfn/n) and dissipation (ΔDn) changes in the overtone n = 3 during adsorption of unmodified t-CNCs and biotin-functionalized
t-CNCs (t-CNC–HC-Biot and t-CNC–PEG-Biot, respectively)
at 0.5 g L–1 onto SAV surfaces in buffered solutions
(10 mM phosphate) at pH 7. The arrow indicates the injection of t-CNC,
t-CNC–HC-Biot, or t-CNC–PEG-Biot and asterisk indicates
the rinse step with phosphate buffer.

In the case of unmodified t-CNCs (black line), the frequency
and
dissipation did not change, which indicated that the t-CNCs were not
adsorbed onto the SAV layer. This fact was not surprising because
at pH 7, SAV is negatively charged; therefore, the sulfate groups
will prevent the adsorption of t-CNCs. When t-CNC–HC-Biot were
injected (red line), no change was detected in frequency, suggesting
that there was no adsorption onto the SAV layer. In contrast, in the
case of t-CNC–PEG-Biot (blue line), a great change in frequency
and dissipation was observed, indicating their adsorption onto the
SAV layer. The irreversibility of the binding was assessed by rinsing
with phosphate buffer, which did not induce significant frequency
or dissipation changes. Upon repeating the binding experiment, the
changes in frequency at the end of the adsorption varied among the
experiments from −7 to −230 Hz and dissipation values
varied from 4 × 10–6 to 108 × 10–6 (five different experiments), and in all cases, the rinsing step
did not modify either frequency or dissipation response (Table S2, first line). These variations could
be ascribed to different amounts of t-CNC–PEG-Biot bound to
the SAV layer. Unspecific adsorption of tunicate nanocrystals was
discarded based on the results of unmodified t-CNCs; therefore, the
differences in the t-CNC–PEG-Biot frequency values from one
experiment to the other may arise from the different orientations
of t-CNC–PEG-Biot in a solution so that only those nanocrystals
in which the biotin functionality was close to the SAV surface would
be capable of binding the SAV layer.

To get more insight into
the selective binding to SAV-coated surfaces
by the reducing ends of biotin-functionalized t-CNCs, the adsorption
of unmodified t-CNCs onto positive polymer layers was monitored by
QCM-D. For this purpose, we deposited a layer of poly(allylamine hydrochloride)
(PAH) on gold substrates by spin-coating (see Supporting Information for more details). Figure S5 shows the changes in frequency and dissipation upon
the adsorption of unmodified t-CNC onto the PAH layers (green line)
compared to the binding of biotin-functionalized t-CNC onto the SAV
layers. The changes in frequency and dissipation were greater for
the adsorption of unmodified t-CNC onto the PAH-coated substrates
compared to the binding of t-CNC–PEG-Biot to the SAV layers.
In the case of the PAH layer, unmodified t-CNC will adsorb in a flat
orientation by electrostatic interactions of sulfate groups along
the whole surface, whereas t-CNC–PEG-Biot would adsorb in a
rather perpendicular orientation with reducing ends anchored to the
SAV surface by the specific SAV–biotin binding. The different
viscoelastic behavior of the layers was investigated by the change
in dissipation as a function of frequency (ΔDn – Δfn/n) (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Change in dissipation as a function of the change
in frequency
(ΔDn – Δfn/n) of the
overtone n = 3 corresponding to unmodified t-CNC
and biotin-functionalized t-CNC (t-CNC–HC-Biot and t-CNC–PEG-Biot,
respectively) at 0.5 g L–1 adsorbed onto SAV-coated
surfaces at pH 7. For the purpose of comparison, the ΔDn – Δfn/n plot for the adsorption
of unmodified t-CNC at 0.5 g L–1 onto PAH-coated
surfaces has been depicted (green line). The inset shows the low frequency
and dissipation values in more detail.

In the case of the adsorption of t-CNC–HC-Biot on
SAV, dissipation
did not change considerably with frequency and slightly fell off until
reaching zero. This behavior could confirm the absence of adsorption
of t-CNC–HC-Biot onto the SAV layer. For the adsorption of
t-CNC–PEG-Biot on SAV, ΔDn increased linearly with increasing frequency, similar
to the adsorption of unmodified t-CNC onto PAH, which suggested that
nanocrystals did not undergo significant orientation changes in the
course of the adsorption process.33 It
should be noted that the change in dissipation for the adsorption
of t-CNC–PEG-Biot on SAV is 3 times larger than that for the
adsorption of t-CNC on PAH (Table S2).
The slope of the ΔDn – Δfn/n plot reveals at any point of the curve how much dissipation
is induced by frequency unit, allowing a comparison of the viscoelasticity
characteristics of the films.34,35 Hence, the higher slope
found for the t-CNC–PEG-Biot–SAV system may indicate
that the t-CNC formed a thicker, hydrated, and viscoelastic layer
on SAV, compared to the thinner and more rigid and flatly adsorbed
t-CNC onto PAH. This behavior had been previously described for the
chemisorption of thiol-functionalized cellulose nanocrystals adsorbed
onto gold surfaces compared to unmodified cellulose nanocrystals and
has been ascribed to the different CNC orientations on the surface.13

The assembly of several t-CNC by SAV was
then evaluated by the
change in the Z-size distribution determined by dynamic
light scattering (DLS). The DLS measures the diffusion coefficient
of the particles in dispersion, which is then converted into a hydrodynamic
diameter by the Stokes–Einstein equation. Therefore, the Z-size obtained by DLS is the diameter of a spherical volume
encapsulating a rotating, nonmoving rodlike nanocrystal and not its
actual dimensions. In fact, depending on the relaxation mode used
for the size calculation, the length of tunicate nanocrystals may
vary from 230–270 to 1160 nm from the DLS measurements.36 The hydrodynamic diameter values were thus used
qualitatively and comparatively. The corresponding nanoparticle size
distributions are plotted in Figure 4. The Z-average diameter values and
the polydispersity indexes are shown in Table S3.

Figure 4 Size distribution (intensity) curves of t-CNC at 0.2 g L–1 aqueous dispersions of unmodified t-CNC (black line) and both biotin-functionalized
t-CNC (t-CNC–HC-Biot, red lines, and t-CNC–PEG-Biot,
blue lines, respectively). The size distribution plots after streptavidin
addition are indicated by the lines + circles.

For both HC-biotin and PEG-biotin-functionalized t-CNC, a
monomodal
size distribution centered around 220 and 230 nm, respectively, was
observed, showing the absence of aggregates. Compared to the Z-average diameter of unmodified t-CNC (200 ± 8 nm),
there is a slight increase in the hydrodynamic volumes observed for
biotin-functionalized t-CNC (226 ± 8 and 244 ± 10 nm, for
t-CNC–HC-Biot and t-CNC–PEG-Biot, respectively), which
could be associated with the variability in the DLS measurement.

In the case of t-CNC–HC-Biot, the addition of SAV did not
produce a remarkable effect on size distribution (red line + circles),
and the Z-average diameter was not significantly
modified. In contrast, the size distribution became bimodal for t-CNC–PEG-Biot
containing SAV (blue line + circles), indicating the presence of at
least two populations showing different hydrodynamic volume. Even
if the calculated Z-average diameter was not significantly
modified, the size distribution presented two maxima at 200 and 460
nm, indicating that t-CNC–PEG-Biot formed complexes by the
addition of SAV. Therefore, the peak at 200 nm corresponded to isolate
t-CNC–PEG-Biot and the peak at 460 nm could be ascribed to
complexes of several t-CNC–PEG-Biot linked by SAV, which demonstrates
the specific association.

To directly visualize the assembly
of biotin-functionalized t-CNC,
the complexes containing SAV were investigated by AFM. Figures 5 and 6 show the topographical images of t-CNC–HC-Biot and t-CNC–PEG-Biot,
respectively, assembled by SAV and deposited onto mica substrates.

AFM topographical images of t-CNC–HC-Biot

0.1 g L–1. Bottom images show details of the complexes
formed by two tunicate cellulose nanocrystals and streptavidin (white
squared in top images).

Figure 6 Representative AFM topographical images of t-CNC–PEG-Biot
after the addition of streptavidin, deposited onto mica surfaces at
0.1 g L–1. Bottom images show details of the complexes
formed by four tunicate cellulose nanocrystals and streptavidin (white
squared in top images).

In the case of t-CNC–HC-Biot, the images showed several
isolated nanocrystals and certain t-CNC–HC-Biot end-to-end
assembled by two. In contrast, the images from t-CNC–PEG-Biot
showed a higher degree of association between nanocrystals. In this
case, it was possible to detect star-like assemblies consisting of
four nanocrystals connected end-to-end by SAV. The AFM images from
t-CNC–PEG-Biot also showed that, in some cases, streptavidin
was coupled to the surface of the nanocrystals instead of the reducing
end. This fact could be due to the presence of shorter cellulose chains
on the nanocrystal, resulting from some kind of damage during reactions.
The strikingly different behaviors between t-CNC–HC-Biot and
t-CNC–PEG-Biot were consistent with the differences observed
on QCM-D and DLS experiments. The self-assembly of the t-CNC–HC-Biot
seems to be more difficult than the t-CNC–PEG-Biot association.
Hence, t-CNC–HC-Biot were scarcely associated by SAV forming
assemblies composed of two nanocrystals, which justified the unnoticeable
effect on the size distribution in DLS and the lack of adsorption
in QCM-D. In contrast, up to four t-CNC–PEG-Biot were assembled
by the SAV complexation, which was detected as a bimodal size distribution.
This self-assembly behavior was also highly consistent with the strong
adsorption pattern detected by QCM-D. These results revealed the role
of the spacer linking the biotin moiety and the anchoring group (hydrazine
or amine, for t-CNC–HC-Biot and t-CNC–PEG-Biot, respectively).
SAV is a tetravalent protein composed of two dimers, within which
the monomers are in intimate contact.37 For biotin itself, even if streptavidin changes in conformation
and biotin binding closes off sites,38 there
is no negative cooperativity in the binding, and up to four biotin
molecules can bind to the protein. However, Fairhead et al.39 have demonstrated that large biotinylated ligands,
such as DNA, show a strong negative binding cooperativity if the binding
sites in the SAV structure are arranged in cis conformation and not
in trans orientation. t-CNC can be considered as very large biotinylated
ligands that would inhibit binding by steric hindrance. In this study,
we have chosen two different spacers for facilitating the biotin–streptavidin
assembly. In the case of t-CNC–HC-Biot, the 6-carbon aliphatic
chain seemed to be short enough to prevent the complexation of two
nanocrystals to the same side of streptavidin. The AFM images showed
the binding of two nanocrystals, which would suggest that t-CNC–HC-Biot
already linked to SAV produced negative cooperativity at the same
dimer, whereas the binding to the trans dimer was possible. In contrast,
for t-CNC–PEG-Biot, as the spacer increased in length, in our
study, the PEG chain of seven repeating units, steric hindrance seemed
to be reduced, and therefore, t-CNC–PEG-Biot could occupy the
four binding sites of SAV to form star-like assemblies.

This
article proposes a smart route for controlled supramolecular
association of cellulose nanocrystals. A straightforward modification
at the reducing end, the introduction of a biotin moiety, has demonstrated
to act as an anchoring point for the assembly by a multivalent protein.
Cellulose nanocrystals demonstrate their potential use as scaffolds
for the fabrication of nanomaterials with novel supramolecular architectures.

Conclusions
In this work, we have modified tunicate cellulose
nanocrystals
by the introduction of biotin functionality at their reducing ends.
The objective was the specific and controlled supramolecular assembly
of several nanocrystals by the addition of streptavidin, a protein
that can bind up to four biotin molecules. Results demonstrated that
biotin-functionalized tunicate nanocrystals can be assembled by streptavidin.
The couple biotin–streptavidin has proved to be a suitable
one for assembling several nanoparticles by noncovalent interactions.
The length of the linker between the biotin moiety and the nanocrystal
significantly impacts the assembly, probably by steric hindrance.
Therefore, a certain length of the linker is necessary for the supramolecular
assembly of several cellulose nanocrystals by streptavidin. This work
opens the road for further functional supramolecular assemblies of
nanocrystals with controlled geometry to be used in different applications
such as responsive materials, porosity-controlled membranes, or the
release of target molecules.

Experimental Section
Materials
Streptavidin
from Streptomyces
avidinii (SAV), (+)-biotinamidohexanoic acid hydrazide
(HC-Biot), biotin-dPEG7-NH2 (PEG-Biot), N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride
(EDC), N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), sodium chlorite
(NaClO2), and potassium chloride (KCl) were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (France) and used without further purification. Spectra/Por
dialysis membrane, molecular weight cutoff of 12–14 kD, was
purchased from Spectrum Laboratories Inc. Water was purified by Millipore
Milli-Q purification system (18.2 MΩ).

Cellulose Nanocrystals
Preparation
Tunicates (S. clava) were collected from Quimiac beach (France).
After removal of interior organs, the tunicates were cut into small
fragments and dispersed in distilled water/ice in a waring blender.
Tunicate cellulose pulp was then boiled in 1% NaOH for 10 h and washed
thoroughly in distilled water. This step was repeated twice. The pulp
was further purified by a 0.3% NaClO2 treatment at pH 4.9
for 2 h at 70 °C and washed thoroughly in distilled water, similar
to previously described procedures.40,41 Tunicate nanocrystals
(t-CNC) were obtained by acid hydrolysis. To a cooled suspension of
tunicate cellulose pulp in deionized water, sulfuric acid was slowly
added under vigorous mechanical stirring to reach a final concentration
of 65%. The dispersion was heated to 40 °C and kept at that temperature
for 90 min under continued stirring. The dispersion was cooled to
0 °C, filtered over a small-pore fritted glass filter (0.5 μm),
and washed with deionized water until neutrality was reached. Dialysis
(molar mass cut off 12–14 000 Da) was performed for
15 days. Finally, nanocrystals were redispersed in Milli-Q water at
7 g L–1.

Introduction of Biotin Functionalization
at the Reducing End
of t-CNC
t-CNCs were functionalized at the reducing ends
in aqueous media following the procedure previously described with
minor modifications.14 The aldehyde groups
on the reducing ends of t-CNC (200 mg) were oxidized to carboxyl groups
by the addition of 5 mmol of NaClO2, and the pH was adjusted
to 3.5 using acetic acid, followed by stirring for 20 h at room temperature.
The reaction mixture was subsequently dialyzed against Milli-Q water
to remove excess reactants and side products.

An 8 g L–1 suspension of t-CNC–COOH (10 mL, pH 7) was degassed by bubbling
nitrogen for 20 min and 16 μmol of NHS was added, followed by
80 μmol of EDC, and the pH was adjusted to 6.5 by the addition
of several droplets of HCl 0.1 M. Appropriate amounts of KCl were
added such that the final suspension was 1 M in KCl. Then, 4 μmol
of (+)-biotinamidohexanoic acid hydrazide or biotin-dPEG7-NH2 was added and the pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 9.2
with KOH. The reaction was sonicated (7 W at 20 kHz for 60 s, probe
diameter 3.2 mm, QSonica Sonicator) and incubated under stirring at
room temperature overnight. Biotin-functionalized t-CNCs were purified
by centrifugation (9500 g, 30 min, 20 °C) and then dialyzed (molar
mass cutoff 12–14 000 Da) against Milli-Q water for
15 days.

Coupling by Streptavidin
Biotin-functionalized t-CNCs
were incubated with streptavidin solutions at 40 °C in a tube
rotator for 2 h. The excess of streptavidin was removed by centrifugation
at 9500 g for 30 min at 20 °C. Precipitated t-CNCs were dispersed
in Milli-Q water.

Elemental Analysis
Unmodified, oxidized,
and biotin-functionalized
t-CNCs were freeze-dried and the resulting powder (9 mg) was placed
in tin capsules for analysis. The total C, N, and S contents of t-CNCs
were determined by a C/N/S analyzer (Vario Micro cube, Elementar)
coupled to a gas chromatographic system and a thermal conductivity
detector. Nitrogen content was determined by the Dumas’ method
combustion.42

ζ-Potential and Dynamic
Light Scattering (DLS)
ζ-Potential and
DLS experiments were performed with
a Malvern NanoZS instrument. All the measurements were made at a temperature
of 20 °C with a detection angle of 12.8 and 173° for ζ-potential
and DLS, respectively. The t-CNC solutions were diluted to 0.2 g L–1 without the addition of salt and filtered by 5 μm.
The pH of the t-CNC solutions was 5 in all the cases. The hydrodynamic
diameter was obtained from the analysis of the correlation function
using Malvern DTS software.

Conductometry
The quantity of charges
on the t-CNC
surface charge was measured by conductometric titration with a 0.001
M NaOH solution by a TIM900 titration manager and a CDM230 conductimeter
equipped with a CDC749 conductivity cell.

Quartz Crystal Microbalance
with Dissipation (QCM-D)
The QCM-D measurements were performed
with a Q-Sense E4 instrument
(AB, Sweden) using a piezoelectric AT-cut quartz crystal coated with
gold electrodes on each side (QSX301, Q-Sense). All the measurements
were carried out at 20 °C using the QCM flow cell modules. Gold
electrodes were modified by adsorbing 100 μL of streptavidin
at 0.5 g L–1 for 30 min. Frequency (Δfn/n) and (ΔDn) dissipation changes were
simultaneously registered at 5 MHz fundamental resonance frequency
and its several overtones as a function of time. Any material adsorbed
on the crystal surface induces a decrease in the resonance frequency
(Δf). Dissipation signals (ΔD) were recorded simultaneously to frequency shifts and they provide
a measure of the frictional losses due to the viscoelastic properties
of the adsorbed layer. The overtone n = 3 was used
for comparing the adsorption of unmodified and modified t-CNCs. The
results are expressed as the mean of at least five experiments.

Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)
To analyze
the assembly of biotin-functionalized t-CNC upon the addition of streptavidin,
t-CNC suspensions were diluted 10-fold and then deposited on mica
substrates. Images were collected by an Innova AFM (Bruker) in tapping
mode under ambient air conditions (temperature and relative humidity)
using a monolithic silicon tip (TESPA, Bruker; spring constant k = 42 N m–1; frequency f0 = 320 kHz). Image processing was performed with the
WSxM 5.0 software.

Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)
The t-CNC suspensions in water were deposited on freshly
glow-discharged
carbon-coated electron microscope grids (200 mesh, Delta Microscopies,
France) and the excess water was removed by blotting. The sample was
then immediately negatively stained with phosphotungstic acid solution
(1%, w/v) for 2 min and dried after blotting at room temperature just
before observation. The grids were observed with a Jeol JEM 1230 TEM
at 80 kV. The length of the nanocrystals was determined by the analysis
of TEM images (15 images) using ImageJ software.
