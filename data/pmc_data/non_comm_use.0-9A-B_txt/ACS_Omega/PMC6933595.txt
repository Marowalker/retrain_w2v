Vapor phase polymerization (VPP) is used to fabricate
a series
of tosylate-doped poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) electrodes
on carbon paper. The series of VPP PEDOT/tosylate coatings has varying
levels of crystallinity and electrical conductivity because of the
use (or not) of nonionic triblock copolymers in the oxidant solution
during synthesis. As a result, the impact of the structure on charge
storage capacity is investigated using tetra-n-butylammonium
hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M in acetonitrile). The ability to insert
anions, and hence store charge, of the VPP PEDOT/tosylate is inversely
related to its electrical conductivity. In the case of no nonionic
triblock copolymer employed, the VPP PEDOT/tosylate achieves electrochemical
doping levels of 1.0 charge per monomer or greater (≥100% doping
level). Such high doping levels are demonstrated to be plausible by
molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations.
Experiments show that this high doping level is attainable when the
PEDOT structure is weakly crystalline with (relatively) large crystallite
domains.

1 Introduction
Whether in the context
of large scale infrastructure electricity
supply or for portable electronic devices, the ability to efficiently
store energy and redeploy it at a later time is becoming increasingly
important.1,2 Electrochemical cells, such as supercapacitors3 and batteries,4 provide
one way to address this energy storage need. Within such cells, an
anode and cathode (two electrodes) come in contact with an electrolyte
containing the charge carrying atoms or molecules and can be charged
by applying an electrical potential across the cell (charging). This
causes cations and anions to be physically stored within the anode
and cathode, respectively, to compensate the charges on the electrodes.
Upon discharging, the ions diffuse out of the electrodes and associate
within the electrolyte, releasing a flow of current in the process
to power the connected electrical circuit. Key performance parameters
relate to how efficiently large amounts of charge can be stored within
the electrodes. Research focuses on improved electrode materials that
have increased charge storage capacity,5−7 primarily by increasing
the electrode surface area in contact with the electrolyte.

Conducting polymers have gained interest as electrode materials
in electrochemical devices,8,9 because of their ability
to readily electrochemically exchange anions with the surrounding
electrolyte. For example, as anions are inserted (referred to as doping/oxidizing
in this case) or released, (dedoping/reducing) many conducting polymers
undergo a change in optical properties (electrochromism).10,11 This behavior can be exploited to build devices that switch visual
(even outside the visible spectrum) appearance for applications of
small electrical potentials. The desire for large changes in optical
states between doped and dedoped states necessitates the need for
efficient storage and release of anions, that is, as high charge storage
capacity as possible is desired. Similarly, conducting polymers have
been tested in supercapacitors with a view to use their interaction
with anions to store large amounts of charge.12−14

Central
to achieving high-performance electrochemical devices is
the need to understand what aspects of a conducting polymer lead to
enhanced anion uptake (high doping levels). Of interest is the conducting
polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)—widely regarded
as the prototypical conducting polymer showing high electrical conductivity15,16 and good air stability in its oxidized form.17,18 Recent studies have shown the use of the nonionic triblock copolymer
polyethylene glycol/polydimethylsiloxane/polyethylene glycol (PEG/PDMS/PEG)
in the synthesis of PEDOT doped with tosylate anions can improve its
properties for use in a symmetric supercapacitor12 and for oxygen reduction.19 The
underlying mechanism of this improvement is not well understood and
serves as a motivation for the study herein. In this study, comparison
is made between PEDOT/tosylate films prepared using vapor phase polymerization
(VPP) (Figure 1) using
two different triblock copolymers, polyethylene glycol/polypropylene
glycol/polyethylene glycol (PEG/PPG/PEG) and PEG/PDMS/PEG, with a
reference PEDOT/tosylate having no added triblock copolymer. These
triblock copolymers are added to the oxidant solution used in the
VPP process to synthesize thin films of the conducting polymer.20 The PEG/PPG/PEG is used as a benchmark additive
that leads to enhancement of the properties of VPP PEDOT/tosylate.16,21−24 For ultimate use in an electrochemical device (such as a supercapacitor),
the VPP PEDOT/tosylate is deposited onto a carbon paper substrate.

Figure 1 (a) VPP
process where EDOT vapor condenses at the vapor-solution
interface of the Fe(III)-based oxidant solution. This oxidant initiates
the oxidative polymerization of the EDOT to generate (b) the PEDOT
doped with tosylate anions.

2 Results and Discussion
Electrochemical
oxidation and reduction of the different PEDOT/tosylate
samples were compared using cyclic voltammetry (CV) in 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium hexaflourophosphate in acetonitrile (Figure 2). All samples show
pseudocapacitive response which is typical for PEDOT (Figure 2a), with a doping onset potential
of about −0.6 V versus Ag0/+, followed by a broad
peak at about −0.2 V versus Ag0/+. At +1.0 V versus
Ag0/+, there is some current contribution from overoxidation,
which peaks at +1.6 V versus Ag0/+ if samples are scanned
to such high potentials (Figure S1). Although
this pseudocapacitive CV response is very similar for all samples,
the magnitude of the current differs greatly. Figure 2a shows that the current per gram of PEDOT/tosylate
present is the lowest for the PEDOT/tosylate–PEG/PPG/PEG, much
larger for the PEDOT/tosylate–PEG/PDMS/PEG, and the largest
for the PEDOT/tosylate in the absence of any triblock copolymer. In
fact, there is an order of magnitude difference in the current observed
for the PEG/PPG/PEG and no triblock copolymer samples. The capacitive
contribution from the carbon paper substrate was negligible in this
potential region (Figure S1). The cyclic
voltammograms can be integrated to give a specific charge density
in mA h/g for the different samples (Figure 2b, see details in the Experimental
Section and Computational Methods section). This demonstrates
that the absence of the triblock copolymer yields PEDOT/tosylate with
a significantly higher charge storage capacity than when PEG/PPG/PEG
or PEG/PDMS/PEG is employed in the oxidant solution. The specific
charge values are in the range expected for conducting polymers (electrochemically
prepared PEDOT25 ≈ 14 mA h/g, chemically
prepared PEDOT/chloride26 ≈ 40 mA
h/g, and electrochemically prepared polypyrrole27 ≈ 40 mA h/g)—noting that the as-prepared
PEDOT/tosylate–PEG/PPG/PEG is low and PEDOT/tosylate only is
relatively high. To understand this, the doping levels (oxidation
levels) achieved at 1.0 V versus Ag0/+ (Figure 2c) can be calculated (see details
in the Supporting Information) and are
quite different between the different samples. The origin of these
differences is discussed further below.

Figure 2 (a) CV measurements of
PEDOT/tosylate prepared using PEG/PPG/PEG,
PEG/PDMS/PEG and no triblock copolymer in the oxidant solution, compared
with the heat-treated PEDOT/tosylate variants, all deposited on carbon
paper. The insets present the schematic of oxidized and reduced PEDOT,
which is based on the calculations of the bond length alternation
reported in ref (28). (b) Specific charge capacity determined from CV. (c) Doping level,

samples. For the grayscale version, A denotes Condition A, B denotes
Condition B, and C denotes Condition C, with the subscript “hash”

Figure 3 presents
a range of analyses on the as-deposited samples of PEDOT/tosylate
on the carbon paper. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images highlight
that the PEDOT/tosylate is nonuniformly deposited over the substrate
area (larger area images presented in Figure S2). The electrical conductivity measurements on the flat reference
glass substrate samples (Figure 3d) indicate why there is a change in contrast between
the SEM images in Figure 3a–c: the highest conductivity sample, PEDOT/tosylate–PEG/PPG/PEG,
has a higher electrical conductivity, and PEDOT/tosylate–PEG/PDMS/PEG
has a comparable electrical conductivity, to the underlying carbon
paper substrate (Toray carbon paper is approximately 170 S/cm). Whereas,
in the case of the PEDOT/tosylate with no added triblock copolymer,
the conductivity decreases by 2 orders of magnitude. In this case,
the PEDOT/tosylate will be a poor conduit for the electrons, locally
charging up the surface during the SEM imaging; the underlying carbon
paper will dissipate this charge.

The origins of the changing electrical conductivity
arise from
two sources: (i) the doping level of the as-deposited PEDOT/tosylate,
and (ii) the morphology and structure of the PEDOT chains. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) analysis (Figures 3e and S3) shows a change
in the doping level as the triblock copolymer is changed from PEG/PPG/PEG
to PEG/PDMS/PEG or is completely removed. The magnitude of this change
in doping, however, is not sufficient to completely explain the differences
in conductivity. X-ray diffractograms shown in Figure 3f show that the structure of the samples
also changes. The PEDOT/tosylate–PEG/PPG/PEG displays the highest
level of chain ordering [with diffraction peaks observed from both
(100) and (200) planes] in combination with the highest as-deposited
doping level—therefore the highest electrical conductivity
within this set of samples.

Comparing the electrical conductivity
and specific charge of the
various as-deposited samples (Figure 4) shows an inverse relationship, that is, the lower
the electrical conductivity of the as-deposited PEDOT/tosylate, the
greater its charge storage capacity. The origins of this relationship
are hypothesized to arise from the structure of the PEDOT itself (which
then manifest in the electrical properties in question). The X-ray
diffraction (XRD) analysis in Figure 3f shows that the degree of ordering the PEDOT/tosylate
is different, and the full width at half-maximum of the primary peak
shows that the crystallite size is also changed. In fact, the PEDOT/tosylate
with no triblock copolymer has a relatively lower degree of ordering
yet an increased crystallite size (ca. 25 nm) relative to the other
PEDOT/tosylate samples that employ triblock copolymers (<10 nm)
(Figure 4b). Heat treatment
of PEDOT/tosylate–PEG/PPG/PEG after polymerization but prior
to washing has been shown to modify the resultant properties (higher
doping, lower conductivity, and greater robustness).29 In the study herein, this modification also showed an improvement
in the charge storage capacity, presented in Figure 2. However, this did not positively translate
to the other PEDOT samples. The use of heat treatment for the PEG/PDMS/PEG
sample led to an increase in conductivity and decrease in charge storage
capacity (Figure 4a),
while the loss of charge storage capacity in the sample with no triblock
copolymer was most significant with values decreasing from 130 to
24 mA h/g. The rationale here is that the different triblock copolymers
impart different levels of stability to the polymer film’s
properties during a moderate (70 °C) heat treatment step during
fabrication. The PEG/PPG/PEG imparts stability to the polymer properties
under heat treatment conditions, albeit for a higher conductivity/lower
charge storage capacity to begin with.29 For PEG/PDMS/PEG, a much greater level of stability is seen, with
an increase in electrical conductivity and decrease in charge storage
capacity upon heat treatment. In the absence of any triblock copolymer,
the electrical properties of the PEDOT/tosylate cannot survive the
heat treatment process, with a dramatic drop in charge storage capacity.

bond lengths along a PEDOT chain containing nine repeat units at a
doping level of 100% (red solid circles and solid line) compared to
the neutral PEDOT (green open circles and dashed line).

The high doping level of 100%—reached with
the cyclic voltammogram
at +1.0 V versus Ag0/+ for PEDOT/tosylate synthesized without
any triblock copolymer—signifies that each 3,4-ethylenedioxythiopene
(EDOT) monomeric unit bears one positive charge, each compensated
by one counterion. This is highly unusual for conducting polymers,
which can typically only be charged to doping levels of 25–33%
before undergoing overoxidation reactions that lead to degradation.
Given the value is determined from the electrochemical experiment,
it cannot be assigned to anions associated with cations (i.e., salt)
as these anions would not contribute to the electrochemical charge
stored. Similarly, the high charge per monomer only occurs for PEDOT
without the triblock copolymer—therefore, coordination with
the ethoxy groups cannot assist in such high levels of charge per
monomer. It is also worth noting that these higher doping levels are
not associated with an increased stable potential range, but rather
with a higher capacitance. In other words, each oxidation step, introducing
a positive charge on the PEDOT backbone, has only a small influence
on the potential required for the next oxidation step, and thus allowing
more charge to be stored in the same potential interval. This implies
that the charges introduced on the PEDOT backbone are very efficiently
shielded (minimizing the Coulombic interactions with the surrounding
PEDOT charges) because in the fully charged state, every monomeric
unit is positively charged, although this hypothesis requires further
research, out of scope of this manuscript. In a previous study, we
have also observed high capacitance and doping levels (up to 69%)
for vapor phase-polymerized PEDOT/tosylate (employing a PEG/PDMS/PEG
triblock copolymer) in ionic liquid-based supercapacitor cells, and
we then hypothesized that the triblock copolymer provided such efficient
shielding.12 However, the results presented
herein show that even higher doping levels are obtained when the VPP
process is performed without any triblock copolymer, showing that
the triblock copolymer is not necessary for—but in fact detrimental
to—obtaining high doping levels. Judging by the fact that no
significant change occurs during consecutive CV cycles, when tosylate
counterions are exchanged for hexafluorophosphate (from the supporting
electrolyte), and also considering that the results are analogous
to those of supercapacitor cells where dicyanamide anions were used,
this effect appears rather general and not specific to this particular
electrolyte or solvent.12

To rationalize
the apparent influence of the triblock copolymer,
we present the following hypothesis. The study herein and previous
reports24 have shown that the introduction
of a triblock copolymer into the VPP process yields greater alignment
of PEDOT chains within the film. Such proximity of chains should facilitate
good interchain charge transport and thus higher charge mobility and
higher electrical conductivity. At the same time, it is hypothesized
that the local order/aggregate structures have greater alignment which
imparts a certain “rigidity” to the chain packing structure.
This rigidity restricts the chains from sufficiently separating to
accommodate large numbers of anions from inserting/intercalating during
the electrochemical oxidation. This draws comparison with paraffinic-like
microstructures for polymer semiconductors.30 Conversely, in the absence of the triblock copolymer, the reduced
chain alignment decreases the mobility and electrical conductivity
(retards interchain hopping), while allowing the packing structure
to “swell” to accommodate much larger numbers of anions
during oxidation. Such a hypothesis puts the chain packing structure
(not necessarily crystallinity though) as the central property that
defines the trade-off between electrical conductivity and charge storage
capacity (cf. the inverse relationship in Figure 4a).

Overoxidation limits the maximum
positive potential that can be
applied to the samples, and this usually means that also at lower
potentials, the conducting polymer will lose charge in a so-called
self-discharge process.31,32 This was investigated
by charging samples to 1.0 V versus Ag0/+ and then monitoring
the spontaneous potential decrease during the self-discharge process
(Figure S4). In all cases, the self-discharge
rate was exponentially dependent on the potential, in agreement with
previous observations.12,32 This indicates that self-discharge
proceeds via an unstable intermediate reached through a higher oxidation
state, which can also be observed by CV at 1.6 V versus Ag0/+ (Figure S1).32 Overoxidation thus does occur for these PEDOT/tosylate samples also
and at a similar potential to what is commonly observed for conducting
polymers, but the higher capacitance means that more charge can be
stored in these samples before this overoxidation starts to contribute
to any appreciable extent. Furthermore, calculations indicate that
the PEDOT itself is not inherently unstable at high doping levels
(vide infra), but the limitation lies in its vulnerability to nucleophilic
attack by other species such as solvents, anions, dissolved oxygen,
impurities, and so forth. It should thus be possible to improve the
stability at high potentials by the proper choice of the electrolyte
system and careful exclusion of oxygen and other impurities. Also,
larger crystallite size seems to improve stability by limiting the
solvent access to the bulk of the PEDOT, as observed for the no triblock
copolymer samples.

To confirm the plausibility of such high
doping levels for the
PEDOT/tosylate without any triblock copolymer, a coarse grain molecular
dynamics (MD) simulation and density functional theory (DFT) calculations
on PEDOT/tosylate were made as a function of doping level (and hydration
level). Noting here for simplicity that (i) tosylate ions are used
to dope the PEDOT in these calculations to levels beyond those previously
reports (>50% oxidation) and (ii) water is used as the solvent
instead
of acetonitrile. The simplified model is designed to give an indication
of the likelihood that PEDOT can accommodate such high doping levels
without degradation. Figure 4c–f shows the outcomes of the MD simulations—although
it should be noted that the structure discussion to come may not exactly
represent the structures formed using the VPP process. The snapshot
in Figure 4c highlights
the intercalation of tosylate ions between the PEDOT chains at a 100%
doping level and a hydration level from 80% dried to 10%. The tosylate
ions position at the same distance from the PEDOT as typically observed
for the π–π stacking of PEDOT chains [the (010)
plane] at lower doping levels. As the doping increases, there is a
complete loss of the nearest neighbor π–π stacking
of PEDOT (approx. at 75% doping in Figure 4d) and then loss of the stacking all together
(200% doping). At a doping level of 100%, the packing appears as π–anion−π
stacking of PEDOT–tosylate–PEDOT. The calculated radial
distribution function as a function of doping level and hydration
level is presented in Figure S5, along
with a snapshot of the MD simulation for 100% doping and 80% hydration
where the π–anion−π stacking is clearly
evident. In this case, the 80% hydration level is presented to replicate
the highly solvated case in the electrochemical measurements with
acetonitrile in direct contact with the PEDOT/tosylate.

Note
that formation of the intercalated structure can explain the
inverse dependence between conductivity and charge storage capability.
Recently, multiscale transport calculations were reported for PEDOT/tosylate
relating its mobility to the material morphology.33,34 These studies outline the importance of the π–π
connections between polymeric chains forming a percolative transport
network through the whole sample, which represents a prerequisite
for a high mobility of the polymeric films. When tosylate counterions
intercalate between the polymeric chains in the samples with high
doping levels, the π–π connections are apparently
destroyed, which suppresses the charge carrier hopping between the
chains and hence leads to the mobility decrease as compared to the
moderately doped samples. This rationale is supported by previous
work by Petsagkourakis et al. who positively correlated crystallinity
with charge carrier mobility.35

DFT
calculations (Figure 4e) show that the PEDOT chain is stable at 100% doping, with
the conjugated backbone being positively charged within the middle
of the chain. The carbon–carbon bond length within the middle
of the PEDOT chain (Figure 4f) approaches a purely aromatic structure (benzene bond length
≈ 1.40 Å). The longest bond lengths near the end of the
chain (1.46 Å) appear sp2–sp2 in
character (ca. 1.47 Å). Such bonding character indicates probable
stability of the PEDOT chain at such high doping levels.

3 Conclusions
In summary, a variety of
PEDOT/tosylate films were prepared via
VPP to study their charge storage capacity. Comparing the addition
of different nonionic triblock copolymers (PEG/PPG/PEG and PEG/PDMS/PEG)
reported in the literature with no triblock copolymer highlights that
although they enhance the electrical conductivity, they adversely
impact the charge storage capacity. Similarly, the use of post-VPP
heat treatment has previously been reported as a useful means to enhance
the properties of PEDOT/tosylate; however, this proved disadvantageous
for charge storage. The absence of the triblock copolymer in the VPP
process yielded PEDOT/tosylate film with weak structural ordering
(observed peak relatively smaller compared to those with the triblock
copolymer present) and a much larger crystallite size. This combination
is hypothesized as the key to increased charge storage capacity, with
electrochemical doping levels of 100% achievable. Simulation and theoretical
calculations demonstrate the likely intercalation of tosylate between
PEDOT chains in the (010) plane and a conjugated bonding network of
carbon atoms that appear aromatic in nature. All these results combine
to suggest that the morphology/structure of the PEDOT/tosylate after
the VPP process is critical to defining the ultimate charge storage
capacity. A larger charge storage capacity demonstrated herein will
in turn result in more efficient energy storage devices.

4 Experimental Section and Computational Methods
4.1 Materials
Fe(III) tosylate (Clevios
CB54, 54 wt % in butanol) was obtained from Heraeus. The EDOT monomer
PEG/PPG/PEG of Mw = 5800 g/mol (Pluronic P-123), acetonitrile, and
tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate were received
from Sigma-Aldrich. PEG/PDMS/PEG (DBE-U12) was purchased from Gelest.
Butanol and 100% undenatured ethanol were purchased from Chem-Supply.
All chemicals were used without further purification. The choice of
the molecular weight and structure of the PEG/PPG/PEG triblock is
based on previous work for performance improvement of PEDOT/tosylate
through higher levels of crystallinity.24 The basis for using the PEG/PDMS/PEG was previous work on PEDOT/tosylate
in supercapacitors.12 The carbon paper
substrates (Toray carbon paper, wet proofed with 40 wt % poly(tetrafluoroethylene)
coating) were supplied from Fuel Cell Earth LLC. The glass substrates
(76 × 51 × 1 mm borosilicate glass) were provided by ProSciTech.

4.2 Oxidant Solutions and PEDOT Fabrication
Three categories of oxidant solution were prepared as per the formulae
mentioned in Table 1. The labeling of Condition A, B, and C refers to the use of PEG/PPG/PEG,
PEG/PDMS/PEG, and no additive, in the oxidant solutions.

a Each oxidant solution (Condition
solution A, B, and C) contains a different nonionic triblock copolymer
(PEG/PPG/PEG, PEG/PDMS/PEG, and none, respectively).

The carbon paper substrates were cut into 20 ×
25 mm size
and attached on a glass slide as shown in Figure S6. The prepared oxidant solution was dip-coated on to the
carbon paper as per the dip coating parameters given in the Table 2.

In the case of the glass reference substrate, the
oxidant solutions
were spin-coated (400B-6NPP, Laurel Technologies Inc.) at a speed
of 1500 rpm for 25 s. Prior to the oxidant-coating step, the substrates
were air plasma-treated (Diener, Plasma etcher NANO, Germany) for
2 min to remove contaminants and to increase the wetting of the oxidant
solution. The oxidant-coated substrates were then placed on a hot
plate at 70 °C for 1 min to evaporate the excess solvent. Samples
were removed from the hot plate and transferred to the VPP chamber
(Binder VD115) containing a Petri dish with 2 drops of the EDOT monomer.
The chamber was evacuated to 45 mbar at room temperature (ca. 23 °C)
and the Petri dish containing the EDOT heated to 35 °C. After
45 min, the samples were taken out from the chamber and immediately
washed with ethanol to remove any remaining oxidant and unreacted
monomer. This general procedure is presented in the schematic of Figure 1, with samples labeled
with the subscript #. A second set of samples were prepared, where
the PEDOT/tosylate was heat-treated after the VPP process at 70 °C
for 7 h before the ethanol washing step. Such samples are referred
to as “heat treated” and labeled with the subscript
“ht”.

4.3 Characterization
Elemental analysis
of the PEDOT samples was carried out using XPS (SPECS SAGE, Phoibos
150-HSA) with a Mg anode (200 W power). The quantitative analysis
(atomic percentage and doping level) of the XPS results were carried
out using CasaXPS software. The doping level of each sample was analyzed
using the methodology used by Bubnova et al.36 Two doublets were fitted to the spectra, with a spin-split, S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2, and with the energy splitting set
at 1.2 eV (Figure S3). These doublets,
(163.8 and 165 eV) and (167 and 168.2 eV), correspond to neutral PEDOT
and oxidized PEDOT, respectively. The doping level was then calculated
using the ratio of oxidized PEDOT to neutral PEDOT.

The SEM
images of the samples were obtained using Carl Zeiss Microscopy Merlin
with the GEMINI II column. An accelerating voltage of 2 kV was used
to produce secondary electron signals for imaging.

The sheet
resistance (Rs) of the PEDOT
films (prepared on glass slides) was measured using a four-point probe
[Jandel Engineering (RM3 Drive Unit, 500 μm tip, 60 g load,
1 mm tip spacing)]. The film thicknesses (t) were
measured using a mechanical profilometer (DektakXT, Bruker). Narrow
slits were scribed on the sample, and the step height between the
film surface and the glass substrate was measured. The electrical
conductivity (σ) of the film was then calculated using σ
= (Rs·t)−1. Values were obtained by taking the average and standard deviation
of multiple (>3) measurements of Rs and t across each respective sample.

The
PEDOT mass on carbon paper was measured by thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) (model 2950, TA Instruments). A temperature range of
20–600 °C with a ramp-up speed of 20 °C/min was used
for the analysis. Blank carbon paper (without any PEDOT coating) was
used as a reference sample. The PEDOT mass was calculated by subtracting
the mass of the reference sample from the PEDOT-coated sample. The
details of this calculation are described in the Supporting Information, with an example calculation provided
for the TGA measurement in Figure S7.

Micro X-ray diffractometer measurements (micro-XRD Max Rapid II,
Rigaku) were performed to determine the texture of the PEDOT/tosylate
films. A Co anode (1.79026 Å wavelength, 4 min exposure time,
0.8 mm collimator size) was used to generate the radiation at an angle
of 5°, and XRD patterns were recorded over a 2θ range 4–40°.

Samples of PEDOT/tosylate coated onto the carbon paper substrates
were analyzed by CV in a three-electrode electrochemical cell using
a Reference 600 Potentiostat/Galvanostat (Gamry Instruments, USA),
with 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium hexaflourophosphate
in acetonitrile as the electrolyte. The samples were mounted on a
Pt wire working electrode, the reference electrode consisted of Ag
wire kept in a separate compartment (10 mM AgNO3, 0.1 M
tetra-n-butylammonium perchlorate in acetonitrile),
and the counter electrode was Pt coil. The electrolyte was thoroughly
degassed with N2 and then kept under a N2 atmosphere
throughout the experiments. The samples were immersed in the electrolyte,
and the open circuit potential was monitored until remaining stable.
Samples then underwent CV between −1.0 and +1.0 V versus Ag0/+ at a scan rate of 0.1 V/s. From the CV data, the specific
charge and doping level were determined by averaging the integrated
current of the first oxidation and reduction sweeps (in order to avoid
errors from polarization and instrument current bias) for 4–10
samples of each type and normalizing with the mass of PEDOT/tosylate
as determined by TGA. Further details on the calculation of the doping
level can be found in the Supporting Information. Self-discharge experiments were performed after CV by first sweeping
the potential to 1.0 V versus Ag0/+ (0.1 V/s) and then
keeping the potential constant at 1.0 V versus Ag0/+ for
60 s and subsequently measuring the potential at an open circuit.
The self-discharge rate was calculated as a function of potential
as described previously.12

4.4 Simulation and Theoretical Calculations
A set of Martini coarse graining37−39 MD simulations were
employed at different doping levels to study the interaction between
PEDOT chains and tosylate anions at a variety of doping levels. These
MD simulations extend to much higher doping (oxidation) levels beyond
those reported previously (>33%).40 More
details of CG simulations and PEDOT model are in our previous work.40 All MD simulations are performed by using the
Gromacs package.41−43 Similarly, DFT calculations were made at doping levels
of 100 and 200% to ascertain the electron density along a PEDOT chain
at these extremely high doping levels.
