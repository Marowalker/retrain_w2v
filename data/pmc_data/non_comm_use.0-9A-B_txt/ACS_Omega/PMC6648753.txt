Self-healing
mechanism of microcracks on waterborne polyurethane
(WPU) with varied disulfide bond contents was investigated thoroughly
in this paper. The self-healing process could be observed by an optical
microscope, which was divided into two steps. The first step was the
cohesive healing movement, closely related with microphase separations
and further characterized by the Fourier transform infrared peak fitting,
differential scanning calorimetry, and dynamic mechanical thermal
analysis. The second step of the exchange reactions of disulfide bonds
could be confirmed by the in situ Raman and tensile mechanics. In
addition, the cohesive healing behavior was quantitatively described
by the kinetic method, and the exchange reaction active energies of
disulfide bonds were also calculated to be 20.42 kJ/mol by gel permeation
chromatography tests. The best self-healing performance of SHWPUs
was WPU-8, and it could be healed at 75 °C in 15 min with 100%
self-healing efficiency. Combining the self-healing process observation
with the kinetic analysis can provide deep insights into the self-healing
mechanism of microcracks.

Introduction
When structural materials are exposed
to harsh environments or
suffer external stimuli, microcracks will form, which will threaten
the integrity of the material matrix and even lead to mechanical failure.1−3 These microcracks are difficult to detect, thereby troubling engineers.
Many advanced detection technologies have been developed to solve
the problem of microcracks.4,5 To a large extent, the
implementations of these technologies should recourse to manual interventions.
The newly emerging concepts of self-healing provide an elegant route
for self-healing of microcracks.6 Recently,
considerable progress for self-healing materials has been obtained,6−25 which shows great advantages in prolonging the service life and
lessening maintenance costs.

Waterborne polyurethane (WPU),
a kind of engineering material,
also suffers from microcrack problems. Combining the self-healing
function and WPU is greatly advantageous for the recovery of mechanical
integrity. Given that the molecular structure of WPU is versatile
and tunable, the most direct method is to introduce self-healing functional
groups to the main chains. In general, these self-healing functional
groups are attributed to the field of reversible chemistry. If they
are distributed around the microcracks, they will bind the crack faces
through reversible reactions under suitable conditions. On the basis
of these premises, some self-healing waterborne polyurethanes (SHWPUs)
have been successfully prepared.26−31 Moreover, high-quality SHWPUs can be synthesized by importing the
disulfide bonds to the structures,27,28 which exhibited
excellent self-healing performance.

In recent years, disulfide
chemistry has been applied in the field
of polymer materials.32 Given that the
exchange reactions of disulfide bonds are easy to carry out, many
self-healing materials based on disulfide bonds have been prepared.
Canadell et al.16 synthesized a kind of
coating with commercial epoxy resins containing disulfide bonds. By
changing the ratios of disulfide with other components, different
self-healing degrees can be acquired, among which the highest disulfide
concentration demonstrated the optimum self-healing efficiency. Regardless
of disulfide content, the mobility of the molecular chains also showed
great effects. Generally, rigid matrix can inhibit the movements of
disulfide bonds, as well as weaken the cohesion and adhesion abilities.
Lafont et al.33 explored the influence
of different extenders to the self-healing performance of material
matrix, demonstrating that the introduction of more cross-linking
points to the system would promote the self-healing of disulfide bonds.
In addition, the self-healing process depends on the state of microcracks.
Garcia et al.34 probed the self-healing
property of vulcanized natural rubber by tuning the disulfide/polysulfide
ratio and found that the self-healing efficiency was related with
the postcuring storage time, time between damage creation and re-establishment
of mechanical contact, and actual healing time. Given that self-healing
is a complex topic, exploring the self-healing chemical functional
groups, matrix structures, and internal/external environmental conditions
is considerably critical to understand the self-healing mechanism.

The earliest research on the disulfide exchange reactions were
confirmed by chemorheology.35,36 To date, chemorheology
remains a classical method to demonstrate the existence of the exchange
reactions of dynamic reversible chemical bonds, such as disulfides.
With the development of disulfide chemistry in the field of materials,
more and more technologies are being used to explain the nature of
this self-healing principle. Odriozola et al.37 synthesized a kind of self-healing polyurethane by incorporating
aromatic disulfide compounds, which can be healed at room temperature
without manual interventions. As the synergism of exchange reactions
of disulfides with the aid of quadrupole hydrogen bonds formed, the
self-healing activation energy was found to be 55 kJ/mol by the stress
relaxation method, demonstrating the possibilities of self-healing
at room temperature. By combining rheology and mechanical concepts,
Garcia found that hydrogen-bonding self-healing efficiency was separated
from the aromatic disulfide exchange reactions, which can be both
described quantitatively.38 Given that
the occurrences of exchange reactions can change the molecular features
such as molecular weight, Zhang et al.39 utilized this property to characterize the dynamic nature of polymers
containing disulfide bonds. In addition, dynamic mechanical thermal
analysis (DMTA) can also disclose the existence of exchange reactions
for disulfide bonds.40 Although all the
above-mentioned methods can characterize the self-healing phenomenon,
self-healing process analysis of microcracks is still lacking. Hence,
a kinetic approach to observe microcracks was established, and the
self-healing mechanism for SHWPUs was also improved, which could be
an effective way to gain further comprehension of the self-healing
mechanism.

In this study, a series of SHWPUs with varied contents
of disulfide
bonds was synthesized using prepolymer mixing. The SHWPU is a kind
of thermoplastic elastomer that has inherent self-healing ability
with intense molecular diffusion ability. The exchange reactions of
disulfide bonds in the structure of SHWPU can promote the self-healing
performance. Therefore, a dual functional self-healing material can
be obtained. Except for the basic physical property characterizations,
the self-healing mechanism and their self-healing kinetics were mainly
analyzed by optical microscopy and gel permeation chromatography (GPC).
The optimum formulation and conditions were also obtained through
mechanical tests. The relationships between structures and performance
were explored, providing theoretical guidance for forming highly effective
self-healing materials.

Experimental Methods
Materials
Poly(propylene
glycol) (PPG, Mn = 1000, industrial grade,
Tianjin Petrochemical Co.,
Ltd, China) was dehydrated at 120 °C for 6 h before use. Isophorone
diisocyanate (IPDI, industrial grade, Bayer AG, Germany) and 2-hydroxyethyl
disulfide (HEDS, industrial grade, Aldrich) were used as received.
2-Bis(hydroxymethyl)propionic acid (DMPA, industrial grade, Beijing
Linshi Fine Chemical & New Material Co., Ltd, China) was dried
at 100 °C for 12 h. Butanone (MEK, analytical grade, Beijing
Chemical Works, China), triethylamine (TEA, analytical grade, Tianjin
Fuchen Co., China), ethylenediamine (EDA, analytical grade, Tianjin
Fuchen Co., China), and 1,4-butylene glycol (BDO, analytical grade,
Tianjin Fuchen Co., China) were also used as received.

Experiments
SHWPUs with different amounts of HEDS in
the main chains were synthesized by the prepolymer mixing process.
First, PPG, DMPA, and IPDI were sequentially added in a 250 mL three-necked
flask connected with a mechanical stirrer, a nitrogen inlet, and a
condenser. The mixture was heated to 85 °C and reacted for 3
h. Then, the temperature was lowered to 60 °C, and different
mole ratios of BDO and HEDS (5:5, 4:6, 3:7, 2:8, 1:9, and 0:10) were
added in the above reaction system. The mixture was heated for another
6 h to obtain the prepolymer. Then, 20 g MEK should be added into
the mixtures if the viscosity was high. TEA was next added into the
prepolymers to neutralize the carboxylic acids for 30 min and form
ionic groups below 40 °C. The prepolymers were subsequently emulsified
by deionized (DI) water with EDA at 2000 rpm for 30 min. The MEK was
removed using a rotary evaporator at 40 °C for 40 min. Finally,
WPU emulsions for different molar ratios of BDO/HEDS were obtained,
which were named as WPU-5, WPU-6, WPU-7, WPU-8, WPU-9, and WPU-10.
The detailed formulas are shown in Table 1, and the synthesis diagram is shown in Scheme 1.

Preparation of Films
Emulsions of
SHWPUs (20 g) were
poured into Teflon molds to dry at room temperature for 7 days. After
the evaporation of water, dried films were obtained with thickness
of 0.5–1 mm. These films were placed in a vacuum oven for further
maturation. The temperature was set at approximately 45 °C, and
the maturation time was 12 h.

Characterization
1H NMR and 13C NMR
1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of the WPU-10 and WPU-C were
measured by an Avance III HD 400 MHz Instrument (Bruker Co., Germany)
with deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d6) as the solvent.

Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR)
The SHWPUs films
were tested using Fourier infrared transform spectroscopy of Nicolet
8700 FTIR (Thermo Nicolet Corporation). The scan range was from 4000
to 650 cm–1 with a resolution ratio of 4 cm–1 for a total of 48 times.

In Situ Raman Spectroscopy
The Raman spectroscopies
were tested using the Labram HR Evolution spectrometer, and the wavelength
of the laser was 536 nm. The special wave position was approximately
at 510 cm–1, which is the signal of disulfide bonds.

Particle Size and Zeta-ζ
Particle size and Zeta-ζ
were characterized using a laser particle size instrument (Malvern
Zetasizer Nano ZS90). The SHWPUs emulsions were diluted to 1 wt %
using DI water. The equilibrium time was set for 120 s, and the emulsions
were tested three times for sequential analysis.

Viscosity
Viscosity was measured using the Brookfield
Programmable DV-II+Pro Viscometer. The rotor is zero size at 150 s–1. The temperature was 25 °C, and the data of
the last 100 points were averaged.

Centrifugal Stability
Equal amounts of emulsions were
placed in two centrifuge tubes that were positioned symmetrically
in the high-speed centrifuge (ZONKIA, HC-3018). The speed was set
to 3000 rpm, and the centrifugal force was 1.5 kg. After centrifuging
for 5 min, no precipitations were observed, indicating that the emulsions
were stable.

Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
The thermal
properties were tested by DSC (Mettler Toledo). A total of 10 mg of
sample was placed in an alumina crucible with the temperature increasing
from −80 to 150 °C. The heating rate was 10 °C/min,
and the nitrogen purging rate was 30 mL/min.

Dynamic Mechanical Thermal
Analysis (DMTA)
DMTA tests
were performed using METTLER Instrument DMA/SDTA861e at the shear
model device and a frequency of 1 Hz. The temperature range was from
−80 to 80 °C under nitrogen atmosphere with a heating
rate of 5 °C/min. The dimensions of the test specimens were square
samples with the length 4 mm and thickness 0.4 mm.

GPC
The molecular weight was obtained using GPC (LC-20A,
Shimadzu) at 35 °C with tetrahydrofuran as the mobile phase and
flow rate of 1 mL/min. The raw data were calibrated using a universal
calibration with polystyrene standards.

Optical Microscopy
The self-healing processes of the
microcracks on samples were observed using the Leica optical microscope
DM 2500P, and the samples were heated with a Linkam hot stage. To
observe the self-healing process, the temperatures were set at 70,
75, and 80 °C with heating rate of 10 °C/min.

Mechanical
Property
Dumbbell-shaped samples were divided
into two groups. The first group was composed of samples scratched
with 300 μm-deep cracks using a micrometer scratch instrument.
The samples in the second group were used as the control. They were
both placed in an oven at different temperatures (70, 75, and 80 °C)
for 20 min. Then, the tensile strength (σm) and elongation
at break (εm) of the specimens were measured using
a universal testing machine (Instron-6022, Shimadzu Co., Ltd.) with
a tensile rate of 100 mm/min. The final results were expressed as
the average of three samples.

Results and Discussion
Analysis
of Emulsion Properties
The fundamental properties
of SHWPU emulsions are summarized in Table 2. With the growth of disulfide bond contents
from WPU-5 to WPU-10, the mean particle size showed an increase and
then decreased trend, of which the maximum value is 73.33 nm for WPU-8.
Many factors influence the particle sizes, such as ionic amount, molecular
flexibility, solid content, etc. So in the formula design, the contents
of PPG, IPDI, DMPA, TEA, EDA, and solid content were all set at the
same levels. Through changing the amounts of BDO and HEDS, a series
of SHWPUs were made at R = 1.243. Working as extenders,
BDO and HEDS could increase the rigidity and toughness of the molecules.
So incorporations of BDO and HEDS will change the flexibility of the
molecules. In general, the more flexible the molecules are, the smaller
are the particle sizes.41 When the content
of HEDS introduced was little, the molecules were still keeping their
stiffness, which made the particle size increase. However, when the
content of HEDS was more, the flexibility of the molecules increased,
which could not be ignored by the disulfide bond in HEDS with better
flexibility than BDO. Therefore, the synergistic effects of BDO and
HEDS made the particle size increase first and then decrease. As can
be seen in Figure 1, particle size distributions are unimodal and narrow as well as
the polydispersity index Đ is relatively small,
indicating that the emulsion particle sizes are homogenous. Zeta-ζ
is a critical parameter that can reflect the stability of SHWPU emulsions,
the absolute values of which were all larger than 30 mV, demonstrating
that the emulsions were in stable states. In general, the small particles
had thick hydrated electric double layers, which exhibited stronger
interactions with water molecules, increasing the viscosity of emulsions.
In addition, no precipitants were found at the bottom of the centrifugal
tubes, indicating that the emulsions reached the stable standards.

Structure Characterization
The chemical structures
of SHWPU films characterized by FTIR and Raman spectroscopy are shown
in Figure 2. Compared
with conventional WPUs, some common FTIR peaks can be found in Figure 2a, involving peaks
at 3330, 2920, and 1104 cm–1, which are attributed
to the stretching vibrations of the −NH–, −CH2–, and −C–O–C– groups,
respectively. For the unique structural features of the −C=O
groups in urethane and urea, the stretching vibration peaks at 1707
and 1650 cm–1 were also detected. The peaks at 1560
cm–1 were assigned to the bending vibrations of
−NH–. In addition, the complete disappearance of vibrations
at 2270 cm–1 related to the −NCO groups demonstrated
that SHWPU films were cured completely. In addition, no peaks of −OH
groups were observed, confirming that all the diols participated in
the reactions, especially for the self-healing component of HEDS.
The intensity of the disulfide bonds of HEDS is weak and cannot be
detected in the FTIR spectra. To determine whether the disulfide bonds
are accurately inserted into the main chains of WPUs,28 Raman spectra were used to detect the existence of disulfide
bonds. In Figure 2b,
the obvious stretching vibration peaks at 510 cm–1 for disulfide bonds can be observed. As the content of disulfide
bonds increased, the intensities of these peaks were also enhanced,
further showing that SHWPUs were successfully synthesized.

of SHWPUs: (a) FTIR and (b) Raman spectra.

1H NMR and 13C NMR
The structures
of WPU-10 and WPU-C confirmed by 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra are shown in Figures 3 and 4, respectively. In the 1H NMR spectra, the signal of methylene closest to the disulfide
bond was at 2.6–3.0 ppm, exhibiting multipeak distributions.
However, the signal of the second nearest methylene shifted to high
frequency with the distance of 1.0 ppm, which was also due to the
influences of disulfide bonds. As can be seen in Figure 4, 13C NMR spectra
of WPU-10 had some differences about the methylenes near disulfide
bonds compared with WPU-C. There are two peaks at 41.57 and 59.88
ppm, which did not exist in WPU-C. These two peaks were, respectively,
attributed to the second and first nearest methylenes to the disulfide
bonds, demonstrating that the HEDS were successfully introduced into
the macromolecules of WPU.

Degree of Hydrogen Bonding
The degree of hydrogen bonding
was characterized by infrared peak fitting and was used to obtain
the relationship between the microphase separation and varied disulfide
contents further. In general, hydrogen bonds can be formed between
the hydrogen of the −NH– groups and oxygen from the
urethane or urea of hard segments (HS) and ether of soft segments
(SS). The higher the degree of hydrogen bonding in hard segments is,
the higher the degree of microphase separation. Meanwhile, the hydrogen
bonds formed between the soft segments and hard segments will cause
the phase mixing. The wavenumbers at 1600–1800 cm–1 are typically assigned to the stretching vibrations of −C=O,
whereas the wavenumbers at 3100–3600 cm–1 are for −NH–. Then, these peaks were deconvoluted
with a number of iterations to obtain the best fit for Gaussian peaks,
the area percentages and positions of which are also listed in Tables 3 and 4. As shown in Table 3, the degree of hydrogen bonding in hard segments could be
described by parameters of XH and Harvey–Bradshaw
index (HBI) reaching the minimum values as 44.27% and 0.8 for WPU-8
indicates that the degree of microphase separation of WPU-8 is the
smallest and the hydrogen-bonding interactions are relatively weak.
In Table 4, the hydrogen
bonds of hard segments (HS) for SHWPUs occupy a large proportion,
and the trend is in accordance with the HBI indexes. The indexes of
SS/HS for −NH– groups show an opposite trend, suggesting
that the phase mixing of WPU-8 is large. The aggregations of hydrogen
bonds result in the microphase separation, limiting the movements
of molecular chains. The smaller microphase separation of WPU-8 means
the stronger molecular diffusion ability, which is more helpful to
its self-healing performance. In addition, hydrogen bonds are a kind
of dynamic reversible noncovalent bonds that can be utilized to prepare
the intrinsic self-healing materials. The self-healing performance
of hydrogen bonds is related not only with the degree of hydrogen
bonding but also with hydrogen-bonding styles. Here, the double hydrogen
bond is formed within urethane and the quadruple hydrogen bond is
formed within urea, which are weak due to the asymmetrical structure
of IPDI and the more flexible small-molecule extenders HEDS. The lower
degree of hydrogen bonding with the weak hydrogen styles was the reason
why hydrogen bonds did not play major roles in this self-healing system.
Hence, the self-healing degree is dominated by microphase separation,
that is, molecular diffusion mobility.

Glass-Transition Temperatures for SHWPUs
Figure 5a shows the DSC test results
for SHWPUs. Obviously, there are two Tg’s for every SHWPU sample exhibited in this figure. One was Tg1 of soft segments at low temperature, which
were in the range of −33 to −37 °C. The other was Tg2 of hard segments at high temperature in the
range of 84–99 °C. Tg1 increased
to the maximum value of −33.0 °C for WPU-8 and then decreased,
whereas Tg2 exhibited the opposite trend.
As ΔTg = Tg2 – Tg1 can be used to
measure the degree of microphase separation, the smallest ΔTg of WPU-8 indicates that it possesses a weak
degree of microphase separation, further indicating strong molecular
diffusion mobility. Generally, self-healing happens above the temperature
of Tg1. High self-healing temperature
is favorable to promote cohesive recovery.33 If the temperature is higher than Tg2, the material matrix starts becoming soft, which is not suitable
for use. Some studies had detected that the beginning of self-healing
temperature was at 65 °C. So the appropriate self-healing temperature
should be chosen between 65 and 80 °C. In addition, the effect
of self-healing time is plotted in Figure 5b as a function of T –
ΔTg. With the increment of disulfide
bond contents, the value of T – ΔTg shifts from high temperature to low temperature,
then shifts to high temperature again. This was due to the influences
of material structure like microphase separations. Meanwhile, the
self-healing time decreased with increasing T –
ΔTg for the same sample, confirming
that high temperature is beneficial to the cohesive self-healing.
Besides this, higher value of T – ΔTg indicates that the molecular diffusions occur
easily. Hence, Tg also influences the
self-healing performance in a potential way.

(b) self-healing time with various T – ΔTg values.

Dynamic Mechanical Thermal Analysis (DMTA)
Figure 6 shows the results
of DMTA tests about the storage modulus E′
and loss factor tan δ for SHWPUs. From Figure 6a, E′
of SHWPUs exhibited a decreasing and then increasing trend with the
varied contents of HEDS. The E′ of WPU-8 was
the lowest, indicating that the nature of material itself was soft
and difficult to resist to deformations compared with other samples.
However, in Figure 6b, the values of tan δ for SHWPUs were increasing as
the temperature increased, along which there were two peaks attributed
to the Tg of soft segments and hard segments.
The details about the Tg are listed in Table 5. In Table 5, Tg1 decreased and then increased in the temperature range of −18
to −23 °C, whereas the trend of Tg2 was opposite in the temperature range of 53–60 °C.
If the values of Tg2 – Tg1 were still smaller, it indicated that the
degree of microphase separation was smaller. The values of Tg2 – Tg1 are
also listed in Table 5, among which Tg2 – Tg1 of WPU-8 was the smallest, showing that WPU-8 had the
smallest degree of microphase separation. This further indicated that
the molecular chains of WPU-8 moved more easily, which was more helpful
to achieve the cohesive behaviors. When the temperature was higher
than the Tg2, the materials were found
to be in the viscous flow state, especially WPU-8 should have a higher
tan δ value. TIn fact, the tan δ values
of WPU-8 to WPU-10 were relatively lower than the other samples due
to the exchange reactions of disulfide bonds, which limited the movements
of molecular chains and signaled the occurrence of this reaction.

Optical Microscope Analysis
The self-healing process
was monitored using an optical microscope equipped with a Linkam hot
stage. First, the films of SHWPUs were cut into 4 mm × 4 mm squares.
Then, 300 μm-deep microcracks were made on the square samples
using a micrometer scratch instrument. These samples were placed in
the hot stage to observe the microcrack changes at constant temperatures,
70, 75, and 80 °C. Finally, the varied microcracks were photographed
using a Leica camera every 30 s. Here, the self-healing processes
of WPU-8 and WPU-C at 75 °C are listed in Figure 7. As shown in Figure 7a, the two faces of the microcrack approached
slowly before 6 min; then, it was narrowed and became shallower after
6 min. This was because molecular chain movements were activated gradually
by the stimuli of temperature. Especially in the later stage, the
movements of molecular chains were more intense, which accelerated
the velocity of self-healing. At 15 min, the traces of the microcrack
were almost invisible, indicating that this film had the self-healing
ability. Compared with the self-healing process of WPU-8, the light
traces of the microcrack on the control sample of WPU-C in Figure 7b still existed after
heating for 15 min. Given that these environmental conditions were
all set at the same levels (including the samples’ shape, method
of heating, operation process), the sole different element between
the structures of WPU-8 and WPU-C was only the presence of disulfide
bonds. Hence, the disulfide bonds were concluded to play important
roles in the self-healing process.

(b) WPU-C at 75 °C
for 15 min.

The disulfide content
will increase with the self-healing process
of the microcrack. To detect the traces of disulfide bonds, in situ
Raman was used to monitor this change in sample WPU-8, as shown in Figure 8. As can be seen
from Figure 8, the
strength of peak νS–S located at 510 cm–1 for disulfide bonds was enhanced on prolonging the
time, indicating that disulfide bonds played important roles in binding
the microcrack.

at 80 °C.

Self-Healing Mechanical
Property
Tensile test is a
common method used to quantify the self-healing efficiencies. The
dumbbell-shaped samples were divided into two groups. The sample in
the first group was scratched with a microcrack as shown in Figure 9a–d using
a micrometer scratch instrument. Then, it was placed in the oven with
the control sample and heated to the target temperature. After 20
min, the samples were taken out to rest at room temperature. Tensile
tests were carried out after 24 h using the machine shown in Figure 9e. Given that the
sample with the microcrack can heal to some degree, the self-healing
efficiency can be calculated using eq 1. 1  Self-healing experiments for WPU-5–WPU-10
at different temperatures, 70, 75, and 80 °C, were conducted.
The tensile curves are shown in Figure 10, and the calculated self-healing efficiencies
are listed in Table 6. The self-healing efficiencies demonstrated the same trend with
the microphase separations at the same temperature because the self-healing
process was greatly affected by the molecular chain diffusion movements,
which are limited by microphase separations. Thus, molecular chain
diffusions played significant roles in the self-healing process. Moreover,
disulfide bonds also had important effects. When the contents of the
disulfide bonds were minimal, such as that of WPU-5, the disulfide
bonds could not take exchange reactions effectively, leading to weak
break points, which decreased the tensile strength. Compared with the mechanical property of
WPU-C, the self-healing efficiencies were higher for WPU-7–WPU-10,
indicating that the self-healing efficiencies can be improved by disulfide
bonds.

Furthermore, the self-healing efficiencies were improved
by the
disulfide bonds, which can be found in WPU-8 and WPU-9. Generally,
the self-healing efficiencies of the same sample for gradually increasing
temperatures showed a decreasing trend. For WPU-8 and WPU-9, the tensile
strengths were increased to the maximum value at 75 °C, which
was obviously different from other samples. This finding was because
the tensile strength of self-healing samples was related not only
to the strength of the matrix itself but also to the self-healing
reactions of disulfide bonds. The material matrix provided the major
strength of the tensile stress. When the temperature increased closely
to Tg2, the material matrix was soft.
Hence, the tensile stress decreased such as that of WPU-C. The self-healing
efficiencies of WPU-8 and WPU-9 further increased, especially at 75
°C, which was abnormal.43 Given that
the influence of the self-healing degree by the exchange reactions
of disulfide bonds was higher than the softening degree, the self-healing
efficiencies increased. Overall, the synergies in strength of matrix
and self-healing degrees through disulfide bonds determined the final
performance. Similarly, the elongation at break also displayed the
same trend due to the same reasons.

Self-Healing Mechanism
and Kinetic Analysis
SHWPUs
synthesized here are thermoplastic materials, which have the self-healing
ability inherently. Wool and O’Connor44 had discussed the self-healing mechanism of this kind material and
proposed that the diffusion is the most important step to control
the final self-healing performance. Combining the self-healing microscope
observation and the theories proposed by previous research, the whole
self-healing process is simplified and divided into three stages.
The first stage is the cohesive movements of the two sides for microcracks.
The second stage is the diffusion of molecular chains cooperated with
the exchange reactions of disulfide bonds. The third stage is the
randomization of molecular chains. Details about the self-healing
mechanism are shown in Figure 11. In this process, cohesive healing ability and the
exchange reaction activation energy of disulfide bonds are two important
parameters influencing the previous two self-healing stages. Cohesive
healing ability, which defines the self-healing process of microcracks
on the SHWPU films monitored by the optical microscope, can be evaluated
by the kinetic analysis method. The data points of the self-healing
cohesive recovery process are described by eq 2 2  where dt is the
width of the microcrack at time t and d0 is the original width of the microcrack at initial time t0. In general, polymers can transform from one
kind of equilibrium state to another under the external influences
of the environment. This transformation was time dependent, which
can be described by the relation of deformations with relaxed time
using eq 3(45) 3  By fitting the self-healing
data points, the fitting curves are shown in Figure 12, and the relaxed times τ of WPU-5–WPU-10
for different temperatures are calculated and further listed in Table 7. Notably, the relaxed
times were prolonged with decreasing temperature. However, at the
same temperature, the relaxed times decreased and then increased,
which was not only determined by the content of the disulfide bonds
but also related to the molecular chain movements limited by microphase
separations. When the microphase separation degree of WPU-8 was the
smallest, the molecular chain movements were easier, which was in
accordance with the trend of hydrogen bond analysis results. To calculate
the cohesive healing activation energy, eq 4 of relaxation time τ with these activation
energies was also used 4  The parameter τ0 is a constant,
whereas τ is listed in Table 7. Ea is the cohesive healing
activation energy, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. Then, ln τ at
different temperatures is used to fit eq 4, and the final Ea values
are also listed in Table 7. The smaller Ea value indicates
high cohesive healing ability. The cohesive healing activation energy Ea decreased and then increased from WPU-5 to
WPU-10 as the content of the disulfide bonds increased. WPU-8 showed
the smallest Ea, illustrating that WPU-8
more easily exhibited cohesive healing actions.

mechanism.

Once the two sides of the microcrack are close enough
with the
favorable temperature conditions, the exchange reactions of disulfide
bonds would take place, which is a critical factor in the self-healing
process. Otsuka et al.46 explored this
exchange reaction using photoirradiation and found that the molecular
weight tended to be at the middle of the two different molecules as
time passed. Similarly, in this study, experiments designed by testing
the molecular weight can be used to characterize the exchange reactions
of disulfide bonds under the influence of temperature. The high and
low molecular weights of SHWPUs were mixed, and the chains were altered
at the suitable temperatures in a long period to ensure that the exchange
reactions of disulfide bonds could reach the new equilibrium. On the
basis of this premise, equal amounts of WPU-L (Mn = 31 372 g/mol) and WPU-10 (Mn = 18 113 g/mol) emulsions were mixed. The samples
were placed in the oven at different temperatures, 65, 70, 75, and
80 °C. With the time interval of 12 h,47 the molecular weights of these samples were tested by GPC. Each
sample was tested five times with a total time of 60 h, and the results
are listed in Table 8. In fact, the molecular weights were all changed with the varied
temperatures and times, indicating that the exchange reactions of
disulfide bonds occurred.

80	25 953	24 693	24 129	23 804	23 260	
To calculate the active energy of the disulfide bonds
in SHWPUs,
the molecular weight should be converted to mole values using eq 5 5  where n stands for moles, t is
time, and Mn is the molecular
weight. Meanwhile, the reactant concentration c is
proportional to 1/Mn. The reactant concentration c is related with the reactive velocity constant k by the reaction order relationship as follows 6  where k is the reactive velocity
constant and n represents the reactive orders. As n could take 0, 1, 2, and so on, the integration formulas
are listed in Table 9. On the basis of these relationships, the reactive velocity constant k could be obtained by fitting the integration relationships.
Then, the reactive activation energies Ea of different orders could be obtained based on the Arrhenius eqs 7 and 8, which are also listed in Table 9. The best fitting result was 20.42 kJ/mol with n = 0. 7   8  On the basis
of the results in Table 9, the best fitting reactive
activation energy was 20.42 kJ/mol with the highest R-square of 0.9953, indicating that exchange reaction of disulfide
bonds in this system was zero order. The ref (48) reported that the self-healing
disulfide bond was about 23.1 kJ/mol for first-order kinetics, which
was higher than the reactive activation energy of this system. It
may be that the molecular movements were activated by temperature,
which made the molecular chains more flexible and mobile,49,50 further aiding the exchange reaction of disulfide bonds, so the Ea was relatively lower. To achieve the self-healing
goals for the samples, some heat should be conveyed to facilitate
the cohesive healing movements. Once the microcrack faces were close
enough, the disulfide bonds could undergo exchange reactions with
a small amount of heat. Hence, the self-healing process was dominated
by the molecule chain movements and cooperated with the aid of disulfide
bond exchange reactions.

Conclusions
SHWPUs were successfully
synthesized by importing disulfide bonds.
The self-healing mechanism was affected by the amount of disulfide
bonds, microstructure, and external factors such as temperature. By
tuning the content of disulfide bonds in the WPUs and the temperature,
the optimum self-healing conditions were obtained at 75 °C with
WPU-8 for 15 min, and the self-healing efficiency was 100%. The self-healing
kinetics demonstrated that the cohesive healing activation energy
of WPU-8 was the smallest due to the faster molecular diffusion mobility.
GPC can be used to calculate the reactive activation energy of disulfide
bond exchange reactions, which was approximately 20.42 kJ/mol. So
self-healing was closely related with the cohesive healing behavior
of microcracks and exchange reactions of disulfide bonds. The analysis
of mechanism and kinetics provided deep insights into the self-healing
process, and the relations between structure and the properties of
SHWPUs provide a reference for creating self-healing materials.
