Resonantly excited
plasmonic gold nanoantennas are strong sources
of third-harmonic (TH) radiation. It has been shown that the response
originates from large microscopic nonlinearity of the gold itself,
which is enhanced by the near-field of the plasmonic nanoantenna.
To further enhance this response, one can incorporate nonlinear media
into the near-fields of the nanoantenna, as an additional TH source.
To obtain a significant contribution from the added medium, its nonlinear
susceptibility should be comparable to that of the antenna material.
Many organic materials offer the necessary nonlinear susceptibility
and their incorporation is possible with simple spin-coating. Furthermore,
organic materials are often susceptible to photodegradation. This
degradation can be used to investigate the influence of organic materials
on the hybrid system. Our investigated hybrid organic plasmonic nanoantenna
system consists of a gold nanorod array and poly(methyl methacrylate)
as the nonlinear dielectric medium. The experiments clearly reveal
two contributions to the generated TH radiation, one from the nanoantenna
itself and one from the polymer. The nonlinear response of the hybrid
material exceeds the response of both individual constituents and
opens the path to more efficient nanoscale nonlinear light generation.

1 Introduction
Nonlinear
light conversion is, despite the marginal nonlinear susceptibilities
of natural materials, a common technological application, thanks to
the invention of the laser.1 Triggered
by this low conversion efficiency, much effort was spent to find methods
such as periodic poling2 or materials with
extremely high nonlinear susceptibilities, for example, graphene.3 Nanostructured materials with strong optical
resonances, such as metasurfaces4,5 and plasmonic materials,6 have been studied for enhanced nonlinear effects.
In plasmonic materials, subwavelength-structured metal particles support
localized surface plasmon resonances, which lead to a strong enhancement
of the local electromagnetic field.7 Owing
to the superlinear relation between the exciting field and generated
nonlinear field, nonlinear effects are expected to benefit strongly
from the field enhancement of plasmonic resonances. Various systems
from simple rod antennas8 to split ring
resonators9 up to complicated multiresonant
structures10 have been studied in detail.
All of these systems show significantly enhanced nonlinear conversion
efficiency compared to that of their respective supporting substrate.
However, it should be noted that the overall conversion efficiencies
are small and cannot outperform bulk nonlinear optics. In fact, most
systems are not meant to replace bulk nonlinear crystals but can be
viewed as nanoscale nonlinear light sources with entirely different
applications. In recent years, researchers have also tried to further
boost the efficiency by incorporation of nonlinear inorganic dielectric
materials11−18 and organic dielectric materials.19−21 In these systems, nonlinear
dielectrics are placed within the locally enhanced electric near-field
of the plasmonic structure and are thus expected to radiate stronger
nonlinear signals. Several challenges became apparent by this design.
First, most systems use gold as plasmonic component. Gold itself has
a high nonlinear susceptibility.22,23 Hence, all
additional sources of a nonlinear signal have to compete with it.
In order for this ansatz to work, one has to identify materials with
comparable nonlinear susceptibilities. Second, the placement of nonlinear
dielectrics, such as ITO nanoparticles, within the nanoscale volume
of the enhanced near-fields is technologically challenging.11 Third, in many systems it is extremely difficult
to disentangle the different nonlinear contributions to the overall
radiated signal and thus to determine the actual enhancement due to
the nonlinear dielectric. This is particularly true, as the presence
of the dielectric material alters the linear response of the plasmonic
resonances. Especially, the resonance width is changed and thus the
field enhancement, which is of utmost importance for the nonlinear
conversion.11−13 In this article, we are addressing all of these issues
and find that polymers are very suited to overcome these challenges.
Not only are polymers known for their large optical nonlinearities
but they can also easily be applied to a nanostructured surface by
spin or dip coating. Already presented work on organic plasmonic materials
mainly focuses on the nonlinear performance of the used systems.19,20 A rigorous investigation for all influences is often not possible
due to the interplay between linear and nonlinear properties. To obtain
an unambiguous picture of the origin of the nonlinear response, we
use controlled photodegradation of the material to disentangle the
two contributions, namely, from the plasmonic nanostructures and the
polymer itself. The nonlinear response can be monitored in time and
shows a fluence-dependent degradation. After removing and reapplying
the polymer layer, the nonlinear response nearly fully recovers the
original signal strength, demonstrating a noteworthy influence of
the polymer component. In addition, we can exclude any influence of
a change in the linear properties by tracing the fundamental spectrum
during the photodegradation. Combining the controllable off-switch
and the complete comparison of all linear and nonlinear influences
gives for the first time a complete picture of the origin of the nonlinearity
in an organic plasmonic system.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Third-Harmonic (TH) Spectroscopy
To demonstrate our concept, we choose TH generation (THG) from
simple
gold-rod nanoantennas. A tilted scanning electron micrograph (SEM)
is shown in Figure 1b. The hybrid system consists of the gold-rod antennas and a homogeneous
layer of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA).

Figure 1 (a) Schematics of the
spectroscopy setup. The laser impinges on
the sample (S). The collected light can be sent by a flip mirror either
through a neutral density filter (ND) to investigate the fundamental
light or through a Fourier pulse shaper to detect only the TH. (b)

(c) Top: Measured laser spectra of the tunable TiSa laser. The pulse
duration changes from 350 fs for 770 nm to 250 fs for 860 nm. The
laser spectrum is tuned over the fundamental resonance of the gold
antenna array (black), and the corresponding TH response is recorded.
(c) Bottom: Spectra of the generated TH.

In the upper part of Figure 1c, the linear transmittance spectrum (measured via
Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy) of a bare gold nanoantenna array
over the entire tuning range is shown. The utilized laser source nicely
covers the entire width of the plasmon resonance and thus allows retrieving
the entire nonlinear response. One can also see the change in the
spectral width of the laser pulses. The lower half of Figure 1c depicts the TH spectra generated
by the gold nanoantenna array when excited by the corresponding fundamental
excitations spectra (see color coding). The conversion efficiency
follows the plasmonic resonance, as previously reported.8 To easily compare the spectrally dependent conversion
efficiency between different arrays, we plot in the following TH enhancement.
For this, we integrate the TH spectra and plot the obtained results
versus the center wavelength of the exciting fundamental laser pulse.

The reference TH both from the substrate and the substrate covered
with PMMA only varies slightly with wavelength. This meets the expectations
because the absorption for Suprasil as well as PMMA is nearly constant
over the whole range of the exciting laser and for the generated TH
range.27 Overall, both signals are around
three orders of magnitude weaker than the response from the resonant
antenna array. Because of the weaker signal, the excitation power
for the reference is chosen to be larger than that on the antenna
field. The data is scaled afterward accordingly.

In Figure 2a, we
compare the linear and nonlinear spectra of a bare nanoantenna array
(red) and the hybrid gold–polymer structure (blue). The linear
spectrum of the hybrid system is intentionally blue-shifted to the
bare gold antenna systems to eliminate any influence from the decreased
Drude damping.13 The linear properties
of the resonances are slightly different. The width of the resonance
in the hybrid system is 8% smaller and the transmittance 10% larger.
The increased transmittance of the hybrid system is due to the smaller
gold antennas in the hybrid system. In the TH enhancement spectra
(Figure 2b), both follow
linear resonance but the maximum enhancement is slightly red-shifted
to the linear resonance, as reported previously.8,13,28 For longer resonance wavelengths, we see
a derivation from this redshift, which is most likely due to a varying
time–bandwidth product of our excitation pulses. For absorbing
polymers, three-photon fluorescence is another possible source of
light in the TH wavelength range. However, fluorescence can be excluded
from our experiment, as the recorded spectra show only the strong
TH peak and no fluorescence background, with the characteristic asymmetric
part at larger wavelengths (see Supporting Information (SI)). To predict the nonlinear response from the linear spectra,
a nonharmonic oscillator model (eq 1) can be employed.26 1  All parameters of the model, except
the cubic
perturbation, b, can be deduced from a fit to the
linear spectrum. The model can then predict the shape of the TH enhancement
for both hybrid and bare gold systems. The amplitude of the TH enhancement
is determined by the cubic perturbation, b. The parameter, b, is therefore a measure of the local and microscopic nonlinearity
of the oscillator. In the pure-gold case, this nonlinearity solely
stems from the gold itself, as the nonlinearity of glass is very weak.
The optical response of gold below 500 nm is affected by interband
transitions29 that could considerably change
the nonlinear response. To exclude any influence we measured the THG
for bare gold antennas with different resonance positions and found
the nonlinear response to be well described by the nonharmonic oscillator
model, assuming a constant nonlinear susceptibility (see SI). In the hybrid gold–polymer case,
the nonlinearity should originate from the gold as well as from the
polymer. This behavior is confirmed by the modeled TH enhancement
spectra shown as solid and dashed lines in the lower half of Figure 2. We first modeled
and fitted the enhancement spectrum for pure-gold antennas, shown
in red, exhibiting an excellent agreement with the measured enhancement
factors. Assuming the same perturbation factor, b, for the hybrid systems clearly underestimates the signals, depicted
as the solid blue curve. Taking a four times larger perturbation factor
leads to the spectrum shown as a dashed blue line, which is in excellent
agreement with the measurement. In the framework of the nonharmonic
oscillator model, the perturbation factor, b, is
directly related to the nonlinear susceptibility χ(3).26 The difference in the perturbation
factor therefore infers a different effective χ(3) for the hybrid system. Hence, nonlinearity of the PMMA would influence
the nonlinear response of the whole structure. It is important to
note that other factors might also contribute to the different effective
χ(3). In particular, if the local electric field
distributions should significantly change, the dielectric coating
will certainly lead to a modified field distribution. It is therefore
crucial to further investigate the underlying process and establish
a more solid basis to motivate an altered χ(3) and
rule out other effects.

Figure 2 (a) Linear transmittance spectra for the bare
gold antennas (red)
and PMMA-covered antennas (blue). The lengths of the antennas differ
by 60 nm to compensate for the spectral shift induced by the refractive
index of PMMA. The green curve traces the transmittance of the pure
PMMA, which is transparent in the investigated wavelength region.
(b) The marks indicate the measured TH enhancement spectra of the
hybrid system (referenced to a pure PMMA film) and bare gold system
(referenced to the bare Suprasil substrate). The solid line represents
the prediction of the nonharmonic oscillator model with the nonlinear
parameter of the bare gold system. The model underestimates the hybrid
system by a factor of 4. The dashed blue line is the nonharmonic oscillator
model, with a 4 times higher nonlinear parameter.

2.2 Controlled Photodegradation
To prove
that PMMA is adding an additional nonlinear source, it would be ideal
to switch off the PMMA contribution while leaving the gold system
unchanged. By design, our hybrid system allows such an experiment
in a straightforward manner. Polymers are prone to photodegradation.
The investigated hybrid system exhibits a degradation threshold of
2 mW for a focus of 20 μm (see SI). For the chosen PMMA, the photodegradation leads to a strong change
of the nonlinearity, whereas the linear response, that is, the refractive
index, stays mostly unaffected.30 Illuminating
the hybrid system with a large enough fundamental laser intensity
should therefore degrade the polymer. This will reduce the TH signal
strength of the polymer whereas the TH produced by the gold is left
unchanged. As the refractive index is expected to stay nearly constant,
the linear response of the antenna is also expected to remain unchanged. Figure 3 depicts our measured
time traces of the TH signal for a 5 times higher exposure power than
the degradation threshold. Measurements with further exposure powers
can be found in the supplement. First, the hybrid sample is illuminated
in a vacuum environment, with a pressure of roughly 10–5 mbar. One observes a clear decay of the radiated TH intensity, with
a half-life of roughly 300 s. After an arbitrarily chosen exposure
time of 2125 s, PMMA is removed in N-ethyl-2-pyrrolidon
and acetone. Subsequently, a new layer is spin-coated to the sample.
The sample is again illuminated with the same laser intensity, now
in air. The TH signal strength has recovered and reaches values close
yet 10% smaller than the initial values. The signal is again decaying
with time, now on a much shorter time scale with a half-life time
of roughly 20 s. Under these two environment conditions, the cycles
are repeated. In the second cycle in air, the signal nearly perfectly
matches the initial strength of the first cycle in air and again decays
with a half-life time of roughly 20 s. Finally, another cycle in vacuum
is performed. Again, the TH signal reaches the initial values of the
two cycles in air and decays with a half-life time of roughly 300
s, as in the first cycle in vacuum. The recovery of the signal to
its initial value after refreshing the PMMA layer is also clear evidence
that the decayed signal originated from the polymer. The observed
behavior is in complete accordance with our interpretation. The PMMA
photodegrades, reducing its contribution to the nonlinear signal.
The different decay time scales are also consistent with the literature.
For PMMA, many photodegradation mechanisms are known, some of them
involve oxygen.31 Therefore, the exclusion
of oxygen simply closes the decay channels with oxygen and slows down
the degradation. Furthermore, thermal degradation may also take place.
For gold nanoantennas, a large fraction of the absorbed laser energy
gets converted to heat, leading to a local heating and destruction
of the surrounding polymer.32 One open
point is the reduction of the original TH signal strength. In the
last three cycles, the signal recovers to the same value, yet the
signal is about 10% smaller compared to that of the unexposed sample.
The reason is an additional decay of the signal, stemming from the
bare gold antennas. We have also measured the bare gold antennas (shown
in red) and observed a clear decay in the signal strength on a significantly
longer time scale of about 1500 s, which is independent of the environment.
At the first glance one could expect that the decay of the bare gold
should fit the difference between the polymer cycles, namely, 10%.
The decay of the bare gold antennas is clearly larger. However, the
degradation process for gold can be attributed to a reshaping of the
particles.33 Inside a polymer matrix, the
possibilities for reshaping is limited and most likely causes an increased
stability of gold in the hybrid material.

Figure 3 In blue, the decay of
the TH signal of a hybrid system exposed
to 10 mW average laser power at the plasmon resonance wavelength is
depicted. In red, the decay of a bare gold system is drawn. After
every decay cycle, PMMA is removed and the new PMMA is spin-coated
on the sample. The cycles are measured in the order shown, at the
same spatial point. The decay of the hybrid system is significantly
faster than that of the bare gold system. Furthermore, after one cycle
there is only a 10% persistent decay in the intensity of the PMMA
system compared to its initial TH intensity.

On the basis of this observation, there is a distinct difference
between the THG for the hybrid system and that for the bare gold system.
The THG of the hybrid system nearly completely recovers after the
PMMA replacement and the decay can be cyclically reproduced. This
is clear evidence that a major contribution of the THG stems from
the polymer. However, we have thus far only established the major
influence of the polymer on the signal. Theoretically also a change
in the refractive index and thus a clear change of the linear response
of the antenna could be responsible for the reduction and later recovery
of the signal. To eliminate any influence of the linear properties,
the linear and nonlinear properties were traced in time. Hence, multiple
identical antenna fields were produced and covered with PMMA. Each
field was resonantly exposed for a defined length of time. Before
and after the exposure, the linear spectra of the structures were
measured in a white light setup. In Figure 4a, the change of the TH intensity is depicted.
As observed before, the TH intensity decays rapidly over time. If
this decrease was linked to a change in the linear properties, reflecting
the near-field distribution, this should be noticeable in an increased
full width at half-maximum (FWHM) or a shift in the peak position
of the resonance. These measurements are displayed in Figure 4. First, the peak resonance
position stays constant over time. Hence, a significant change in
the linear refractive index is not apparent, and the resonance is
not shifting out of spectral overlap with the exciting laser. Another
possibility to explain the change of the nonlinear signal with linear
properties is a change in the quality factor of the resonance, which
is encoded in the FWHM. With the decrease of THG, the FWHM should
increase. However, there is no change visible in the FWHM in Figure 4b. With no change
in the far-field spectra, no change in the near-field is to be expected.
Accordingly, the field distribution in the materials system is unchanged.
We have thus proven that the signal is indeed linked to the presence
of the polymer and that it is not originating from a trivial change
in the linear optical properties of the plasmonic resonance. Therefore,
the change in the TH intensity is tied to a decrease in the effective
χ(3) of the hybrid structure due to photodegradation
of PMMA and thus vanishing of the polymer’s contribution to
the radiated TH signal.

Figure 4 (a) The decrease of the TH signal with the exposure
time is traced.
(b) The increase in the FWHM of the linear resonance before exposure
and after a certain exposure time is depicted. The dashed line indicates
the mean value of the measured data and the highlighted red area is
the standard derivation. (c) As second linear property the change
in the peak position with the exposure time is shown. The dashed line
and highlighted red area are the mean value and standard derivation,
similar to the middle part.

3 Conclusions
In this work, we realized
a simple hybrid organic plasmonic structure,
wherein the nonlinear signal clearly originates from both constituents
of the hybrid structure. To our knowledge, this is the first time
that a significant influence of the dielectric χ(3) on the hybrid structure’s χ(3) was conclusively
identified. Owing to the use of an organic material, it is possible
to switch off its nonlinear contribution without changing its linear
properties and distinguish the antennas and the dielectric signal
component. Furthermore, the overall efficiency of the hybrid structure
exceeds the efficiency of its individual constituents. Finally, it
provides an efficient nanoscale TH source and has potential for improvements.
The PMMA could be replaced by polymers, with even higher nonlinear
susceptibility.20,34,35 Nevertheless, many polymers that we tested (P3HT, MeLPPP, and PF2/6) have an insufficiently low damage threshold. The damage
threshold of polymers for this very particular scenario is not documented
and probably also not investigated very well, making a priori judgments
unreliable. To improve at least the nonlinear conversion efficiency,
the use of PMMA guest–host systems36−38 may be possible
because they can exceed easily the nonlinearity of the PMMA. We tested
a DR1-PMMA combination, where we faced a very inhomogeneous and not
reproducible response. To reduce the thermal impact caused by the
gold antennas, other materials such as silicon nanoparticles32 could be tested. Because gold shows degradation,
refractory plasmonic materials, such as titanium nitride, with superior
stability, can be tested as well.33

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Nanostructures
The gold nanostructures
were fabricated via standard electron beam lithography on a UV-transparent,
weakly nonlinear22 Suprasil substrate.
A tilted SEM is shown in Figure 1b. Gold was used for the antennas because it exhibits
a rather narrow plasmonic resonance, leading to a high quality factor.
To construct the hybrid system, the antenna arrays are coated with
a nonlinear polymer, in our case, PMMA. PMMA is a standard electron
beam lithography resist. Thus, it is easily accessible and obtaining
homogeneous films is straightforward. In addition, PMMA provides,
in the investigated wavelength range, a rather high nonlinear refractive
index.24 It is transparent in the spectral
range of the plasmon resonance and starts to absorb below 300 nm.25 We faced significant problems with photodegradation
and inhomogeneities for P3HT, DR1 in PMMA, PF2/6, and MeLPPP
that offer potentially even higher nonlinear refractive indices. All
of these materials were kept under vacuum conditions as well as PMMA
to minimize environmental influences. To cover the antennas, the PMMA
(950 K) is spin-coated on top of the antennas and subsequently annealed
(160 °C for 4 min). The resulting film is around 80 nm thick
and completely covers the antennas. This polymer thickness is chosen
to be sufficiently thick to fully cover that volume around the antenna
in which the field enhancement is expected.19 To minimize environmental influences, the sample is kept in a vacuum
cell at 10–5 mbar pressure. The PMMA can easily
be removed by wet chemical treatment or oxygen plasma. The hybrid
as well as the bare gold antennas are designed to exhibit a plasmon
resonance at 800 nm. As the polymer coating leads to a larger effective
refractive index, the coated and bare gold nanoantennas need to have
different sizes to be resonant around the same wavelength. For the
designated resonance wavelength, this leads to the antenna length
for the hybrid system and bare gold system to be 120 and 180 nm, respectively.
The width of all antennas was chosen to be 50 nm, giving rise to a
well-separated perpendicular resonance at 500 nm. The height of all
antennas is 45 nm. Along the long axis of the antenna, the lattice
constant is 500 nm, and perpendicular to it, it is 333 nm. The lattice
can cause grating anomalies for the TH wavelength regime. To assure
these effects to be negligible, we performed scattering matrix simulations
to investigate the transmittance properties in the UV range of our
sample. The simulations (see SI) show no
noteworthy spectral features at the TH wavelength regime. The nanoantenna
array size is 100 × 100 μm2.

4.2 Measurement Setup
To fully verify
the nonlinear response, it is necessary to sweep over the plasmon
resonance of the studied samples.8,26 We utilize
a tunable TiSa Laser (Mira 9000) with a repetition rate of 75 MHz.
Its tuning range from 760 to 850 nm is depicted in Figure 1c. The pulse duration decreases
from 350 fs at 770 nm to 250 fs at 860 nm. Accordingly, the pulse
width slightly increases. The setup is schematically shown in Figure 1a. We placed a 3
mm thick long pass filter (Schott RG 630) before the sample to remove
all wavelength components shorter than 600 nm. The setup has two detection
arms. One is equipped with a prism sequence used as Fourier filter
to mechanically remove the fundamental wavelength component in the
Fourier plane and detect only the TH signal. The other arm contains
NDs to attenuate and subsequently detect the fundamental laser spectrum.
Thus, this arm is used to measure the linear transmittance spectra
using the tunable laser as white light source. Detection is carried
out with a Peltier-cooled ultraviolet-enhanced CCD-Spectrometer. For
the TH generation, the incident beam is focused to a spot size with
an FWHM of 20 μm, measured by a knife-edge test. All spectroscopic
measurements were conducted with an average power of 2 mW, leading
to peak intensities of around 6 GW/m2. The relative position
between the beam waist and the sample was determined by maximizing
the TH of a test field on each sample. For each sample, the area of
highest linear absorption was used. To account for the changing pulse
duration, possible chromatic aberrations, different detector efficiencies,
etc. the measured TH signals are normalized to the signal generated
by the bare Suprasil substrate. Similarly, the linear transmittance
is normalized to the transmittance of the bare substrate.
