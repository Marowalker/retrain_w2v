The excited-state
proton transfer (ESPT) rate of photo-acids in
a confined medium depends on several physical parameters of the immediate
environment. We introduce a new parameter in the form of charge type at the interface
of reverse micellar (RM) systems to modulate the ESPT rate. We investigate
the ESPT reaction of d-luciferin in mixed RM systems composed
of nonionic polyoxyethylene(5)nonylphenylether (Igepal CO-520) with
cationic didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB) and anionic sodium
bis(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate (AOT) in cyclohexane (Cy) at different
mole fractions of Ig (XIg) and fixed hydration.
ESPT is feeble in AOT RM, whereas it is favorable in the other two
RMs. Addition of Ig is observed to facilitate ESPT in AOT RM linearly,
whereas in DDAB, it shows a synergistic effect. The various physical
parameters of water in the mixed RM water pool have been investigated
using dynamic light scattering, Fourier transform infrared, and time-resolved
fluorescence spectroscopy measurements to underline the ESPT mechanism
in these mixed RMs.

1 Introduction
The
excited-state proton transfer (ESPT) reaction in confined media
has emerged as a fascinating field of research in chemistry and biology.1,2 There have been several studies discussing the pathways of the ESPT
reactions of different excited-state photo-acids and roles of environment
in proton transfer dynamics.3−10 ESPT is mostly governed by the local concentration of water molecules
near the photo-acid and solvent reorganization.11 Following photo-acid excitation, a proton is transferred
to the surrounding solvent. In case of a reversible process, proton
diffusion recombines the two species, and in irreversible cases, recombination
of RO–* with the proton re-forms the ground-state
ROH.12 Reverse micelles (RMs) often mimic
the biological environment, and ESPT in RM can be modeled for specific
activity of chromophores in real systems. ESPT offers valuable insights
into the dynamical nature of water inside RM systems.3,5,7,13−15 The location of the probe and the corresponding ESPT
dynamics inside RM have been found to be markedly dependent on the
nature of the surfactant charge,3,16 pH and dielectric constant
of water inside the RM environment,1 polarity
of the environment, and screening effects of counter-ions present
at the interface.8 An important aspect
in this regard is the role of the interface in deciding the fate of
the ESPT reaction, and accordingly the ESPT dynamics modulates with
the charge type of the RM head groups. For example, in anionic sodium
bis(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate (AOT) RMs, the rate of ESPT increases
with an increase in the water content (w0),3,7 whereas in cationic RMs, the interface-localized
probe offers only subtle changes with w0.4,5,16 Lawler et al. reported
that in AOT RM, the ESPT kinetics of 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonate
(HPTS) resembles that in bulk water, suggesting a diffusion-controlled
power-law time-dependent process, whereas the ESPT rate in nonionic
Ig-520 RM shows a slow, two-component model, with one relatively bulk-water-like
population and second surface-bound population with a slower lifetime.3 A few studies have also correlated the solvation
dynamics around the ESPT probe and its intramolecular proton transfer
dynamics.11,14,15 In this study,
we introduce a new parameter in terms of the interfacial polarity
of RMs by systematically varying the interfacial charge by mixing
of surfactants of different charge types and to investigate its effect
on the ESPT of d-luciferin.

d-Luciferin, found
in the Lampyridae family of fireflies,
is the substrate that is oxidized into oxyluciferin, responsible for
the emission of yellow-green light.17,18 ESPT of d-luciferin has previously been studied in different solvents
of varying polarities, pHs, temperatures, and hydrogen-bonding abilities.12,19−21 Such studies in a restricted water environment, like
in RMs, are only sparse.7 The study by
Kuchlyan et al. suggests that ESPT of d-luciferin in AOT
RM is only feeble at w0 ≥ 12 and
gets favorable as the water content increases.7 ESPT of d-luciferin proceeds when sufficient water molecules
stabilize the polar transition state and the products (protons and
anions). The authors also found that ESPT changes as the polar protic
core of RM is replaced with polar aprotic solvents like dimethylformamide
and dimethyl sulfoxide. In light of all of these investigations, it
is of interest whether the ESPT could be tuned by any other physical
parameter, for example, the charge type at the interface, which could
easily be achieved by mixing of surfactants. In the present contribution,
we have studied the ESPT process of d-luciferin in two different
mixed RMs: anionic–nonionic (AOT/Igepal-520) and cationic–nonionic
didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB/Igepal-520). Mixed surfactant-based
RMs could potentially be employed in a wide range of practical applications
because of their enriched performance over the individual components
and the unique advantage of tuning the interface vis-à-vis
water properties by simply changing the composition.22−24 Double-tailed anionic sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate (AOT),
double-tailed cationic didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB), and
nonionic polyoxyethylene(5)nonylphenylether (Igepal CO-520) (Scheme S1) are the most widely used and well-studied
surfactants to form RMs in cyclohexane (Cy).23,25,26 In our earlier studies, we have explored
how the physical properties of water in mixed surfactant RM systems
are tuned with the interface stoichiometry.23,24 DDAB RMs are known to exhibit unusual physical properties compared
to those of the conventional AOT and Ig RMs. They offer a unique phase
behavior; with increasing hydration, their microstructure changes
from cylindrical rodlike aggregated structures to discrete droplet-type
structures at w0 ≥ 8.26 To exclude any effect arising out of the morphology
of the concerned RM on the ESPT dynamics, we perform all of the studies
fixing w0 at 10 with the assumption that
all of the RMs exist as spherical droplets. In both AOT and DDAB RMs,
Ig is gradually added at different mixing ratios of XIg = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0. We measure the micellar
droplet sizes by the dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique. To
understand the structure and dynamics of the entrapped water in these
RM water pools, we have used Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy
and time (sub-nanoseconds)-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy using
coumarin-500 (C-500) as the fluorophore. We have investigated the
ESPT reaction in these RM systems spectroscopically and tried to correlate
if the process could indeed be modulated by the modification of the
interface.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Solubilization
Capacity Measurements
Figure S1a depicts the maximum water solubilization
capacity of the mixed DDAB/Ig/Cy RM systems. The corresponding values
of AOT/Ig mixed systems23 have also been
plotted for comparison. DDAB is soluble in Cy only beyond w0 = 2, whereas Ig is soluble in Cy, and the
Ig/Cy system can offer the maximum solubilization capacity (w0,max) of 20–25.27 The highest solubilization capacity of the DDAB/Cy system has been
observed to be ∼13.27 DDAB/Ig mixed
RM exhibits a noticeable synergism at XIg = 0.8, which in AOT/Ig was observed at XIg = 0.4 (Figure S1a). The observed synergism
manifests an optimization between two opposing factors, namely, interdroplet
interaction and surfactant monolayer elasticity.27,28 The major driving force of the solubilization limit of water in
RM is the spontaneous curvature and the elasticity (or rigidity) of
the interfacial film formed by the surfactant separating the water
droplets from the oil continuum. It can be maximized by minimizing
the interfacial bending stress of the rigid interface and increasing
the attractive interdroplet interaction.29 As the interface is doped with a nonionic surfactant (herein Ig-520),
it decreases the spontaneous curvature of the interfacial film, making
the interface more fluid, and increases the interaction between the
droplets. Solubilization increases up to the point where the spontaneous
radius of curvature approaches the critical radius, Rc. The solubilization maximum is usually smaller in DDAB
RM because of the low hydrophilicity as well as the bulkier quaternary
ammonium head group size.26 Doping with
Igepal increases w0,max in
DDAB RMs as hydrophilicity increases. It is evident that in the AOT/Ig
system the decrease in the interfacial bending elasticity of the rigid
AOT interface and the increase in the interdroplet interaction with
the doping of the Igepal content are more effective to display higher
synergism in comparison to that in DDAB/Ig systems.

2.2 DLS Measurements
DDAB RMs in Cy are
unique in the sense that at low hydration (2 ≤ w0 ≤ 8), aggregated rodlike cylindrical structures
predominate (length ∼ 14–20 nm and radius ∼ 1.5).26,30 At a higher hydration (w0 ∼ 10),
spherical aggregates of a smaller size are formed (Figure S1b). The droplet size of DDAB/Ig RMs decreases drastically
as Ig is mixed and does not change appreciably with a further addition
of Ig. Interestingly, beyond XIg = 0.2,
the droplet sizes are comparable to those of AOT/Ig mixed RMs and
change only marginally with XIg. It is
evident from Figure S1b that in DDAB/Ig
mixed systems, with the increasing Ig content, the droplet sizes first
decrease to show minima at XIg = 0.4 and
0.6 and then increase. The results indicate that at XIg = 0.4–0.6 smaller droplet formation prevails
rather than the formation of less number of big droplets.

2.3 FTIR Measurements
The O–D
stretching in the MIR region (2200–2800 cm–1) is a potential tool to extract the structural information of water
encapsulated in the RM nanopool.31−34 The overall spectrum of pure
water in this frequency window produces a smooth curve peaking at
∼2508 cm–1. In DDAB/Ig mixed RMs, however,
the curves get broadened and could be deconvoluted into three Gaussian
sub-bands peaking at 2450, H-bonded water (HW); at 2545 ± 5,
intermediated water (IW); and at 2640 ± 10 cm–1, multimer water (MW).35 We calculate
the relative area contribution (Figure S2) of each curve toward the total spectra and plot it as a function
of XIg at different w0 values of the mixed RMs (Figures S3 and S4). Progressive inclusion of Ig in the AOT interface
increases the HW content, which is compensated by a concomitant decrease
in IW and MW abundance, confirming a linear mixing behavior at the
interface. We observe a somewhat unusual trend in DDAB/Ig mixed RMs
in which abundance of HW and IW increases slightly as compensated
by a decrease in the MW content. This study leads us to conclude that
interaction of water molecules with the polar uncharged head group
of Ig is weaker in comparison to that with the charged head group,
whereas for DDAB, the bromine ion might play a role in interacting
with water molecules. The lower droplet size and rigid interface of
AOT decreases the HW contribution, whereas H-bond formation with water
molecules through anionic charged AOT head groups increases the IW
contribution in AOT RM compared to that in the Igepal RMs. However,
the situation is contrasting in DDAB RM as the droplet size is big
with high HW contribution and the large head group of DDAB inhibits
interaction with water molecules, which decreases the IW contribution
compared to that in the Igepal RMs, wherein feeble interaction between
water and the poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) head group of Igepal predominates.

2.4 Fluorescence Measurements
We use
C-500 as the fluoroprobe as its excitation at 409 nm selectively excites
the C-500 molecules at the interface only.25 The decay transients of C-500 are shown in Figure S5. C-500 in water produces an emission maximum (λmax) at ∼505 nm, and in DDAB/Ig RM, it suffers a progressive
blue shift with decreasing w0;(25) however, the change is only modest with XIg. We construct the solvation correlation curves,
and some representative C(t) plots
for different XIg-520 values at w0 = 10 are shown in Figure S6b. All of the C(t) curves
are fitted bi-exponentially, and the time constants are presented
in Table S1 (Supporting Information). The
time constants are on the order of hundreds of picoseconds and a few
nanoseconds.36 The average solvation time
is calculated as ⟨τsov⟩ = ∑aiτi. ⟨τsov⟩ is faster in DDAB RM
compared to that in Ig RM at w0 = 10.
⟨τsov⟩ shows a noticeable minimum at XIg = 0.6 (Figure S6c), whereas it changes monotonically in AOT/Ig mixed RMs.23 A similar trend also follows in anisotropy measurements
(Figure S6d).

2.5 Excited-State
Proton Transfer (ESPT) Study
2.5.1 Steady-State Measurements
The protonated
and the deprotonated forms of d-luciferin show absorption
maxima at ∼330 and ∼390 nm, respectively.19d-Luciferin in water exists in a deprotonated
form, whereas in AOT RM, it exists in a protonated form mostly.19 In AOT RM, d-luciferin prefers to stay
mostly in the protonated form as the pH inside AOT RM is lower compared
to that in pure water.37 Taking into consideration
its oil insolubility, one can expect d-luciferin to occupy
the water-facing interfacial domain of the RMs. In neat water, the
emission spectrum of d-luciferin is dominated by the emission
from the deprotonated (λmaxem = 535 nm) excited state. In Ig and DDAB RMs,
it shows two distinct emission peaks, one at ∼430 nm (protonated
or the neutral form, ROH) and the other at ∼530 nm (deprotonated
or the anionic form, RO–), whereas in AOT RM, the
peak of the deprotonated species is only feeble (Figure 1a). Figure 1b depicts the emission spectra of d-luciferin in DDAB/Ig mixed RMs at w0 = 10 and at different XIg’s,
and the corresponding figure for AOT/Ig mixed RMs is shown in the
Supporting Information section (Figure S7). The fluorescence intensity of the protonated form increases along
with a slight red shift as XIg increases.
For a comprehensive understanding, we plot the ratio of apparent intensity
of the protonated and the deprotonated form (IRO–/IROH) as
a function of XIg (Figure 1c,d). We observe different trends in two
different mixtures. In the AOT/Ig mixture, the relative abundance
of RO– increases monotonically with increasing XIg; however, in DDAB/Ig, we found a maximum
at XIg ∼ 0.6.

line) and in DDAB (red), AOT (blue),
and Igepal (green) RMs at w0 = 10. (b)

2.5.2 Time-Resolved Measurements
We measure
the fluorescence transients at two selective wavelengths (420 and
590 nm) corresponding to the protonated and the deprotonated forms,
respectively (Figure 2 and Table S2). We chose a slightly blue-shifted
wavelength for the protonated form and a slightly red-shifted one
for the deprotonated form to minimize the undesired mixing of the
contributions of the two forms.4,5 The decay transients
at 420 nm could be fitted with multiple decay components fixed at
80, 600, and ∼1500 ps, whereas those in the red end could be
fitted only after considering rise component(s) (Table S2). The decay
of d-luciferin at 450 nm in pure water is rather fast and
is dominated by the ∼80 ps component (99%), whereas at 540
nm, it is slow with components 535 ps (40%) and 5.1 ns (60%).38 The observed rise component for the deprotonated
species unambiguously confirms the presence of an excited-state process
in which emission is emanating from a previously formed excited state
rather than from the species getting directly excited. We plot the
contribution of the fast component (∼80 ps), which is the fall
time for the protonated as well as the rise time of the deprotonated
species (Figure 3a).
It is higher in DDAB RMs and decreases first modestly and then sharply
beyond XIg = 0.4 (Figure 3a). The ∼600 ps component is the lifetime
of the excited state of d-luciferin, which undergoes proton
transfer, forms a ground-state product, and is comparable to the recombination
time of HPTS in different RMs.3 In AOT
RM, the 600 ps component has contributions comparable to those of
the faster one and does not change appreciably with XIg.

590 nm)

nm).

ps component

systems at w0 = 10. (b) Fraction of d-luciferin molecules undergoing the ESPT reaction in mixed
RM systems at w0 = 10.

The multiple decay pattern of d-luciferin
in the RMs can
be rationalized assuming an approximate bimodal distribution in such
a way that only a fraction of the probe undergoes ESPT (Scheme 1). It can be shown that the
concentration of ROH at any time t can be given as 1  where τf and τdp stand for the
time constants for fluorescence emission of
the protonated and deprotonation forms, respectively. Subscripts Y
and N stand for ROH molecules that “do” and “do
not” undergo the ESPT reaction. We fit the ROH decay transients
using eq 1 for both AOT/Ig
and DDAB/Ig mixed RM systems. The τf and τdp values for the AOT, DDAB, and Ig RM systems are found to
be (1.05, 0.12 ns), (0.75, 0.11 ns), and (0.83, 0.10 ns), respectively.
The τf values for the single RM systems are in good
agreement with the average of the two slow components taken together
(Table S2). We plot the relative population
of d-luciferin undergoing ESPT reaction (Figure 3b) in both the mixed RM systems.
The fraction is low (∼0.4) and comparable in AOT and Ig RMs,
whereas it is high (∼0.9) in the DDAB RMs. The trend in DDAB/Ig
mixed RMs is much similar to that of the relative contribution of
the fast component and shows a dip at XIg = 0.4.

Scheme 1 Scheme of the Excited-State Proton Transfer of a Model Photo-Acid
ROH
ESPT is generally a fast process,
yet we observe some slow components
(on the order of nanoseconds) while fitting the emission decay transient
of the ROH* species, which is due to the recombination of the dissociated
proton with the RO–* base. Such recombination is
expected to be governed by a diffusive motion and thus by a t–3/2 power law.3,39,40 At a long time, the intensity of the protonated
species thus can be assumed to follow a relation 2  with the ideal value of n being 3. We try to fit the ROH* decay transients beyond
600 ps using eq 2 fixing
the value of τf as the slowest component of the decay
transient (see Table S2). Some representative
fittings are provided
in Figure 4a. The fittings
are reasonably good except for a few systems,41 and the estimated values of n are plotted as a
function of XIg in Figure 4b. The analysis based on eq 2 should be considered after a note
of caution that the long-time fitting is best-represented for bulk
systems; however, being successfully employed in AOT RMs by Fayer
et al.3 and for the purpose of comparison, it could possibly be extended
in other RM systems also. For AOT RMs, the value of n is rather low (0.96) and is in good accordance with that obtained
for the ESPT of HPTS in AOT/heptane RMs.3 In Ig RM, it is also comparable (n = 1.1); however,
in the AOT/Ig mixed system, the value lies low (n ∼ 0.4) (Figure 4b). For DDAB RMs, however, the value is relatively high (∼1.63).
With increasing XIg, it shows a subtle
increase up to XIg = 0.4 (n = 1.81), beyond which it decreases sharply. It can be noted here
that the power law dependency emanates from the fact that following
deprotonation, protons diffuse away, prohibiting a possible recombination.
In RM systems, the diffusion is prohibited by the confinement of water
molecules; however, it eases with the increasing size of the water
pool.3 Thus, a straightforward power law
dependency is a mere simplification of the complex process, specially
considering the fact that there are multiple locations of the protonated
species inside the RMs and that a fraction of them do not at all undergo
any ESPT process (see Figure 3b); however, the trend in the estimated value of n is intriguing.
Clearly, the bigger size of the DDAB RM is not the sole reason for
the high n value as it does not decrease appreciably
at XIg = 0.2 RM, which has a comparable
size as that of the AOT/Ig mixed system. RO–* gets
specifically stabilized at the DDAB interface, and the proton could
be diffused with more ease as DDAB RM possesses more HW than that
in AOT and Ig RMs, as concluded from the FTIR measurements (see Figures S3 and S4).

fluorescence intensity of protonated d-luciferin in different
single and mixed RM systems. The solid
lines represent the best fit to the e–(t/τf) t–n/2 function. (b) Values of n obtained
for different mixed RM systems as a function of XIg.

To interpret the decay
components more analytically, we measure
the fluorescence transients at several wavelengths across the full
emission spectrum and construct the time-resolved area-normalized
emission spectra (TRANES)42 (representative
figures for DDAB/Ig and AOT/Ig mixed RMs with XIg = 0.6 are provided in the Supporting Information section: Figure S8b,d). We observe a distinct iso-emissive
point at ∼500 nm, which unambiguously indicates the simultaneous
presence of two distinct species. The TRANES profile also clearly
manifests that initially the emission is dominated by the protonated
species, which then diminishes with time with a concomitant increase
in the emission intensity of the deprotonated species. For a better
apprehension of the time evolution of the two species, we deconvolute
each time-resolved emission spectrum (TRES) into two Gaussian curves
corresponding to the two concerned species, and a representative deconvolution
carried out in DDAB/Ig mixed RM at XIg = 0.8 is shown in Figure 5. The yellow shaded curves refer to the protonated form, whereas
the cyan ones represent the deprotonated form. From the time-dependent
deconvoluted curves, we calculate the relative intensity (RI) of the
RO– species compared with the maximum peak height;
thus, RI approximately corresponds to the progress of the ESPT process.
We plot RI as a function of time for different mixed systems (Figure 6a,b). The curves
are linear, however, with a noticeable change in the slope at a longer
time as it approaches the equilibrium values. The slope of the linear
fits (insets of Figure 6) is a manifestation of the time-evolved formation of the deprotonated
form RO–*. In AOT/Ig mixed RMs, the slope is low
and increases monotonically, indicating the ease of ESPT with the
progressive addition of Ig. In DDAB/Ig mixed RMs, the ESPT process
is fast as evident from the slope, however, it is not monotonic, showing
a distinct maximum at XIg ∼ 0.4.
It could be noticed that at XIg = 0.6,
the equilibrium value of RI, which is comparable to that at XIg = 0.4 (Figure 1c), is reached at a longer time.

emission spectra of d-luciferin

0.8 and w0 = 10. The total spectra are
deconvoluted into two Gaussian curves.

to the maximum peak height) in (a) DDAB/Ig and (b) AOT/Ig mixed RMs
at w0 = 10.

It is evident from the representative TRES of d-luciferin
(Figure S8a,c Supporting Information section)
that the emission peak of the protonated species undergoes a noticeable
red shift with time, which indicates its solvation.43 We plot the emission peak frequency as a function of time
for both the mixed RMs (Figure 7a,b). We fit the curves with a single exponential decay function,
and the corresponding time constants are plotted as a function of XIg (Figure 7b). The Stokes shift observed in both the mixed systems
is on the order of 500–1000 cm–1 and is higher
in DDAB RMs. Solvation is in general slower in DDAB RM and is faster
in AOT RM, that of Ig RM being intermediate. The solvation in DDAB/Ig
mixed RMs decreases sharply beyond XIg = 0.4, whereas in AOT/Ig mixed RMs, it shows a subtle maximum at XIg = 0.6.

frequency of the protonated
form of d-luciferin in DDAB/Ig mixed RMs at w0 = 10. (b) Solvation dynamics of the protonated species

We also measure time-resolved
fluorescence anisotropy to understand
the restriction imposed by the RM environment on the fluorophore,
of both the protonated and deprotonated forms of d-luciferin
in mixed RMs (a representative depiction is provided in Figure S9). We observe that anisotropy of both
the forms of d-luciferin is slower in DDAB RMs compared to
that in the AOT RMs, and the value is intermediate in the Ig RMs (Figure 8, Table S3). Fluorescence anisotropy of a fluorophore is intimately
related to its location inside the RM.3 As the probe d-luciferin prefers to stay in the core in
anionic RM, its rotational anisotropy is relatively faster compared
to that of cationic DDAB in which the probe is more interface-bound
and thus slow-rotating. In case of Ig, the poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)
head group of Ig inhibits the rotation of the probe molecule. The
deprotonated species shows a noticeably slower rotational anisotropy
compared with the protonated species in DDAB RMs, intuitively because
of being more inclined to stay at the interface owing to charge neutralization.
The charge repulsion, on the other hand, makes the deprotonated species
stay at the water pool of AOT RMs and shows a faster rotational dynamics
(Figure 8b). Addition
of Ig in DDAB RM does not ease the rotation noticeably up to XIg = 0.4, beyond which it accelerates (Figure 8a). In the AOT/Ig
RM system, the rotation gets slower with XIg more or less linearly.

3 Summary
The proton transfer rate of d-luciferin
depends on various
parameters, such as the size of the RMs, water content (w0), pH of the interface in RM, etc. In this article, we
introduce a new parameter in the form of mixing of surfactant(s)
of different charge types. DLS measurements conclude that pure DDAB
RMs are bigger in size compared with AOT RMs. Addition of Ig decreases
the size of the former, whereas it increases the size of the latter.
However, at and beyond XIg = 0.2, the
sizes of both the mixed RMs are more or less comparable (Figure S1b). FTIR measurements indicate abundance
of intermediate water (IW) inside RMs, which is highest in AOT RM
followed by Ig and DDAB RMs. In AOT/Ig mixed RMs, IW passes through a relatively low value at XIg ∼ 0.4, while in DDAB/Ig mixture the change is more or less
monotonic (Figures S3b and S4b). ESPT is
mostly prohibited in the AOT RMs even at w0 = 10 (Figure 1),
and this result is in accordance with a previous finding by Kuchlyan
et al.7 On the other hand, ESPT is relatively
favorable in both Ig and DDAB RMs. A gradual addition of Ig in AOT
RMs induces the formation of the deprotonated species. It can be noted
that Ig RM is only slightly bigger in size than the AOT RMs (Figure S1b); however, the ESPT process is 90%
less in the latter one, which confirms the predominant role of charge
stability of the deprotonated species at the RM interface. The amount
of HW is relatively less in AOT (Figure S3), which could also inhibit the formation and stability of deprotonated
species. ESPT is more efficient in Ig rather than in DDAB RMs, which
has a positively charged interface and can presumably stabilize the
negatively charged deprotonated species. Rotational anisotropy results
also suggest that the deprotonated species is highly restricted in
the DDAB interface, indicating its preferred location therein. Interestingly,
the most efficient ESPT is observed at XIg = 0.6, wherein the emission peaks of the protonated and the deprotonated
species have comparable intensities (Figure 1b). Notably, the solvation dynamics and anisotropy
of C-500 show its minimum in this mixing ratio of DDAB/Ig mixed RMs,
indicating the system approaching more bulklike behavior. It seems
that ESPT and solvation usually follow each other. It has recently
been shown that when solvation gets faster, so does the ESIPT in 4′-N,N-dimethylamino-3-hydroxyflavone in AOT
RM.14 Datta et al. have correlated the
slowing down of the ESPT process of 2-(2′-pyridyl)benzimidazole
with the slow solvation of the more polar excited state of the tautomeric
form of the probe in the restricted environment of RMs.15 This leads us to infer that the Ig-induced promotion
of ESPT of d-luciferin could be due mostly to its solvatochromic
behavior. The AOT interface is expected to be more acidic compared
with the core as the H3O+ species balances the
surfactant charge by diffusing to the interfacial domain, as also
confirmed from the long-time fitting (see Figure 4). In neutral Ig RMs, the H3O+ species could get partially stabilized at the interface by
both enthalpic and entropic contributions for the interfacial solvation
of the proton.44 Thus, the pH of the interface
in AOT RM is lower compared to that of Ig RM.44 A similar argument infers that the core of the DDAB water pool is
more acidic. It has also been concluded that the bufferlike action
of RM is more prominent in AOT RM than in positively charged CTAB
RMs.45,46 This makes the neutral species preferably
get stabilized at the AOT interface. Addition of Ig reduces the effective
charge at the AOT interface, which favors the formation of the deprotonated
species. Similarly, the apparent increase in ROH* with XIg above 0.6 in the DDAB/Ig system is due to the decrease
of pH at the interface by dilution of charge of DDAB with addition
of Ig.

From the fluorescence decay transients, we obtain the
fraction
of d-luciferin undergoing ESPT, and we observe contrasting
behaviors in the two mixed RMs (Figure 3b). Surprisingly, in pure AOT and Ig, the decay patterns
of the protonated form are quite comparable and thus also the fraction
of the protonated forms (Figure 3), which predicts comparable ESPT in these two systems.
However, the strong charge repulsion and possible recombination probability
eventually inhibit the ESPT process in AOT RMs. In DDAB, the fraction
of protonated d-luciferin undergoing ESPT is high and it
decreases rapidly at and beyond XIg =
0.6. The time-resolved evolution of the deprotonated species, as manifested
by the value of the change in the slope of RI, is an approximate yet
useful parameter to a priori understand the progress of the ESPT process.
In AOT, the slope is rather low, corroborating the less ease to form
the charged RO–* species, whereas in DDAB, it is
presumably high, which is a manifestation of the fact that in this
a larger number of probe molecules are undergoing ESPT than in the
former (Figure 3b).
Addition of Ig increases the slope in AOT/Ig mixed RMs almost linearly.
In DDAB/Ig mixed RMs, it initially increases with the increasing XIg and passes through a maximum. ESPT is favored
if the deprotonation step speeds up by the stabilization of H3O+ and/or RO–*. Initially, a
larger droplet size, comparatively high HW content, diffusion of H3O+ to the core, and RO–* stabilization
by electrostatic interaction in DDAB RM collectively assist the progress
of ESPT to a greater extent compared to that in Ig. Additionally,
interaction of the PEO head group at the Ig interface could initially
hinders the complete exposure of d-luciferin toward water
molecules. However, as H3O+ and RO–* are formed, they get stabilized by the PEO head group and the forward
deprotonation step gets accelerated. The high proton diffusion rate
and high fraction of ESPT undergoing ROH* are expected to show the
maximum rate at an intermediate mixing ratio. Our results show that
the ESPT rate inside RM water pool can be modulated (both increase
and decrease) by only mixing surfactants of different charge types
and keeping all other parameters unchanged. This finding could find
its applicability in its broader implications, specially in situations
where a proton is generated in restricted environments and at an interface
exposed to water.

4 Experimental Section
Sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate (AOT), didodecyldimethylammonium
bromide (DDAB), polyoxyethylene(5)nonylphenylether (Igepal-520), cyclohexane
(Cy), coumarin-500 (C-500), and d-luciferin (Scheme S1) were products of Sigma-Aldrich. All
of the chemicals were used without further purification. AOT, DDAB,
and Ig were individually dissolved in Cy keeping the surfactant concentration
fixed at 0.1 (M) to prepare two stock solutions and then mixed in
the desired proportions to vary the mole fraction of Igepal, XIg = [Igepal]/([AOT] or [DDAB] + [Igepal]),
from 0 to 1. Reverse micelles (RM) are produced by adding calculated
amounts of water into it so as to fix w0 = ([water]/[surfactant]) 10. All of the measurements were carried
out at 298 K.

We determine the water solubilization capacity
of these mixed RM
systems by titration followed by visual inspection, as described in
our earlier studies.23 A Nano-S Malvern
instrument employing a 4 mW He–Ne laser (λ = 632.8 nm)
equipped with a thermostated sample chamber was used for DLS measurements.47 FTIR spectra with 4% D2O in H2O were recorded in a JASCO FTIR-6300 spectrometer (transmission
mode) using CaF2 window in the 2200–2800 cm–1 frequency window. Cy shows negligible absorbance
in this frequency range. We measured the absorbance of the wet RM
(i.e., surfactant (s)/Cy/water mixture) following a baseline correction
with the stock solutions (i.e., dry RM, w0 = 0), which takes care of the absorbance (if any) of the surfactant(s).

The steady-state absorption and emission were measured with a Shimadzu
UV-2450 spectrophotometer and Jobin Yvon Horiba Fluorolog fluorimeter,
respectively. Fluorescence transients were measured and fitted using
a commercially available spectrophotometer (Life Spec-ps) from Edinburgh
Instrument, U.K. (80 ps instrument response function).48 We measure wavelength-dependent transients of
C-500 emission, and from the time-dependent fluorescence Stokes shifts,
as estimated from time-resolved emission spectra (TRES), we construct
the solvent correlation function, C(t)43 3  where ṽ(0), ṽ(t), and ṽ(∞) represent the
frequency (wavenumber) maximum at time zero,
at time t, and at infinity, respectively. We take
the v(∞) value to be the peak maximum, beyond
which the spectral shift is insignificant. The C(t) function represents the temporal response of the solvent
relaxation process, as occurs around the probe following its photo
excitation and the associated change in the dipole moment. Anisotropy, r(t), defined as 4  was measured by adjusting the emission polarization
to be parallel or perpendicular to that of the excitation. G is the grating factor, which was determined following
the long time tail matching technique.49 All of the anisotropies were measured at the corresponding emission
maxima.
