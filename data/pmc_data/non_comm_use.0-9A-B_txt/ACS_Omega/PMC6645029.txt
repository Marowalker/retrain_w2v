The reaction of [PtMe2(6-dppd)], 1, where
6-dppd is a 1,4-bis(2-pyridyl)pyridazine derivative, with bromoalkanes
BrCH2R, having a hydrogen-bond donor group R, gave the
corresponding chiral products of trans oxidative addition [PtBrMe2(CH2R)(6-dppd)], 2a, R = CO2H; 3, R = 4-C6H4CO2H; 4, R = 4-C6H4CH2CO2H; 7, R = 2-C6H4CH2OH; 8, R = 4-C6H4B(OH)2; 9, R = 3-C6H4B(OH)2; and 10, R = 2-C6H4B(OH)2. Complex 2a was formed in equilibrium
with two isomers formed by cis oxidative addition, while the reaction
of 1 with BrCH2CH2CO2H gave mostly [PtBrMe(6-dppd)], 6. The supramolecular
chemistry was studied by structure determination of six of the platinum(IV)
complexes, with emphasis on the preference of the hydrogen bond acceptor
(O, pyridyl N, or Br atom), formation of monomer, dimer, or polymer,
and self-recognition or self-discrimination in self-assembly. Complex 7 formed a monomer with the OH···N hydrogen
bond, and complexes 2a and 10 formed racemic
dimers by complementary hydrogen bonding with self-discrimination
between CO2H or B(OH)2 groups, respectively.
Complexes 3, 4, and 9 formed
polymers by intermolecular hydrogen bonding with self-recognition,
with 4 containing OH···N and 3 and 9 containing OH···Br hydrogen bonds.
It is concluded that there is no clear preference for the hydrogen
bond acceptor group, and that the observed product depends also on
the orientation of the hydrogen bond donor group.

Introduction
The field of supramolecular
chemistry, relying on self-assembly
through intermolecular secondary bonding, is now well developed and
is dominated by the use of intermolecular hydrogen bonding as the
secondary bonding force. In both organic and inorganic compounds,
the hydrogen bonding groups are easily introduced, and the reversibility
and directional nature of the hydrogen bonds has allowed the design
of many complex architectures and functional molecular materials.1 The self-assembly of complex structures is less
developed in organometallic chemistry because of the incompatibility
of the functional groups typically involved as hydrogen bond donors
with the metal–carbon bonds, which are often cleaved by protonolysis.2,3 However, alkylplatinum(IV) complexes are stable to
protonolysis and many electron-rich alkylplatinum(II) complexes undergo
oxidative addition reactions with alkyl halides faster than they undergo
Pt–C bond protonolysis.4 This combination
of properties has allowed the supramolecular chemistry of platinum(IV)
to be developed in a systematic way. Thus, hydrogen bond donors can
be introduced by oxidative addition reactions to platinum(II) complexes.5 A typical example, using bromoacetic acid as
a reagent, is shown in Scheme 1 (R = H, t-Bu, CO2Et), leading
to formation of supramolecular dimers. In contrast, boronic acid derivatives
tend to self-associate through intermolecular BOH···BrPt
hydrogen bonds to give supramolecular polymers (Scheme 2).6

Scheme 1 Introduction

by Oxidative Addition to Platinum(II)
Scheme 2 Introduction of a Boronic Acid Group as a Hydrogen Bond Donor
by
Oxidative Addition to Platinum(II)
In earlier work, we have described the chemistry of the
dimethylplatinum(II)
complex 1.7 It was not possible
to add a second platinum(II) unit to complex 1, and the
platinum center was shown to be a stronger nucleophile than either
of the free nitrogen donors, as illustrated by the oxidative addition
of benzyl bromide (Scheme 3).7 A similar oxidative addition
of alkyl bromides with hydrogen bonding donors as substituents then
should allow self-assembly through OH···O (compare Scheme 1), OH···Br
(compare Scheme 2),
or OH···N hydrogen bonding. This article presents the
results of such a study, including examples of each type of the hydrogen
bond.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
and Spectroscopic Characterization
The synthesis
of some organoplatinum(IV) complexes 2a, 3, and 4, with carboxylic acid groups as substituents
and whose structures were determined, is illustrated in Scheme 4. The compounds were isolated
as air-stable, yellow solids and were initially characterized by their 1H NMR spectra. The square planar platinum(II) complex 1 has an effective plane of symmetry, but the platinum(IV)
complexes are chiral. As expected, complex 3 gave two
methylplatinum resonances at δ = 1.42 and 1.75 with coupling
constants 2JPtH = 70 and 71
Hz, respectively. The protons of the Pt–CH2 group
gave an “AB” multiplet with δ = 2.84 and 2.89
with 2JPtH = 92 and 83 Hz,
respectively. These parameters are typical for organoplatinum(IV)
complexes.5−7 The stereochemistry at the platinum(IV) center was
defined later by structure determination but is also indicated by
the absence of a resonance in the region δ < 1, typical of
a methyl group trans to bromide in related compounds.5−7

Scheme 4 Synthesis of Carboxylic Acid Derivatives
Complexes 3 and 4 were formed
selectively
by trans oxidative addition, but the reaction to give 2a was more complex (Scheme 5). When the reaction of 1 with bromoacetic acid
in acetone-d6 was monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy, a mixture of the three isomers 2a, 2b, and 2c was formed. Each isomer gave
two methylplatinum resonances in the 1H NMR spectrum [2a, δ = 1.46, 2JPtH = 70 Hz, δ = 1.65, 2JPtH = 70 Hz; 2b, δ = 0.73, 2JPtH = 73 Hz, δ = 1.49, 2JPtH = 69 Hz; 2c, δ = 0.75, 2JPtH = 74 Hz, δ = 1.76, 2JPtH = 70 Hz], resonances being assigned
with the aid of 1H–1H NOESY correlations.
After 10 min, 24 h, and 72 h reaction time, the ratio 2a/2b/2c was approximately 3:6:1, 3:1:1,
and 6:1:1, respectively, showing that 2b was the kinetically
controlled product and 2a was the thermodynamically preferred
product. The oxidative addition is expected to occur by the SN2 mechanism to give the 16-electron, ionic intermediate A, and bromide addition would be expected to give 2a.5−8 However, it is likely that A equilibrates with the
more stable 18-electron intermediate B faster than it
undergoes bromide addition (perhaps also aided by an interaction of
the acid group with the free nitrogen of pyridazine), and that the
bromide addition to B gives 2b as the kinetic
product. Slower bromide dissociation from 2b then gives
back the cationic intermediate B which can equilibrate
with A and C to eventually give an equilibrium
mixture of the three isomers 2a, 2b, and 2c.

Scheme 5 Proposed Mechanism of Formation of Isomers 2a, 2b, and 2c
A limitation to this synthetic procedure was found in
the reaction
of complex 1 with 3-bromopropionic acid, which was expected
to give complex 5 by the oxidative addition but which
gave mostly the complex [PtBrMe(6-dppd)], 6 (Scheme 6). The 1H NMR spectrum of complex 6 contained a single methylplatinum
resonance at δ = 1.44 with 2JPtH = 80 Hz, in the range expected for a platinum(II) complex.7 A minor product, formed in about 10% yield, was
characterized by methylplatinum resonances at δ = 2.03 and 2.29,
with 2J(PtH) = 70 and 71 Hz respectively,
similar to values for complex 2a, suggesting that this
complex could be 5. However, it could not be purified
and the spectrum was not fully resolved, so the structural assignment
is tentative. No intermediates were observed when the reaction was
monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy, but it is likely that
an intermediate 5-coordinate complex D is formed which can either undergo β-elimination of acrylic
acid and reductive elimination of methane to give 6 or
bromide coordination to give complex 5 (Scheme 6). The structure of complex 6 was determined and is shown in Figure 1, confirming that the complex is formed selectively
with the methyl group trans to pyridine.7

Scheme 6 Reaction of Complex 1 with BrCH2CH2CO2H
The reaction of 2-(bromomethyl)benzyl alcohol
with complex 1 occurred very largely by trans oxidative
addition to give
the platinum(IV) complex [PtBrMe2(CH2–2-C6H4–CH2OH)(6-dppd)], 7, in about 90% yield, as depicted in Scheme 7. Two minor products were formed, each in
about 5% yield, based on the integration of their methylplatinum resonances,
and are tentatively assigned as isomers of 7. The 1H NMR spectrum of 7 contained two methylplatinum
resonances at δ = 1.40 and 1.77, each with coupling constant 2J(PtH) = 70 Hz. The Pt–CH2 group gave an AB multiplet at δ = 2.67 and 2.85, with 2J(PtH) = 87 and 106 Hz, respectively.

Scheme 7 Oxidative Addition of 2-(Bromomethyl)benzyl Alcohol to Complex 1
The reaction of complex 1 with equimolar amounts of
the isomers of (bromomethyl)phenyl boronic acids proceeded according
to Scheme 8 to give
the corresponding complexes [PtBrMe2{CH2C6H4B(OH)2}(6-dppd)], 8, 9, and 10. The complexes were formed selectively
by trans oxidative addition and were characterized by their 1H NMR spectra. For example, complex 8 gave methylplatinum
resonances at δ = 1.39 and 1.75, with coupling constants 2J(PtH) = 70 and 71 Hz, respectively, and
PtCH2 resonances at δ = 2.78, 2J(PtH) = 92 Hz, and 2.84, 2J(PtH) = 93 Hz.

Boronic Acid to Complex 1
Supramolecular Structural Chemistry
The structures
of several of the platinum(IV) complexes with hydrogen bonding substituents
were determined to investigate trends in the supramolecular chemistry.
The only complex with intramolecular hydrogen bonding was the alcohol
derivative 7, whose structure is shown in Figure 2. The benzyl group is oriented
above the pyridazine ring of the 6-dppd ligand, allowing a weak π-stacking
interaction, and the alcohol group forms a hydrogen bond to the free
pyridyl nitrogen atom, with distance O···N(4) 2.79(1)
Å. The complex crystallizes as a solvate, including a water molecule
which hydrogen-bonds to the alcohol oxygen and to the Pt–Br
group of a neighboring molecule to form a supramolecular polymer.

2.089(7), Pt–Br 2.5991(8), O···N(4) 2.79(1)
Å.

The structure of complex 2a is shown in Figure 3. In this structure, there
is typical complementary, intermolecular hydrogen bonding between
carboxylic acid groups to form supramolecular dimers, with O(1)···O(2A)
= (O1A)–O(2) = 2.63(1) Å. The two molecules in each dimer
are related by an inversion center, so they form a racemic pair by
self-discrimination.

2.5496(15), O(1)···O(2a) 2.63(1) Å. Symmetry-related
atoms: x, y, z;
1 – x, 1 – y, 1 – z.

The ortho boronic acid
derivative 10 also forms a
supramolecular dimer, illustrated in Figure 4. The benzyl group is trans to the bromine
atom as expected, and the benzyl group is positioned directly over
the pyridazine ring, probably to allow π-stacking. Of the two
protons of the boronic acid group, that on O(1) is oriented toward
O(2) of a neighbor to form an intermolecular hydrogen bond, with O(1)···O(2A)
= O(1A)···O(2) = 2.74(1) Å, while that on O(2)
forms a hydrogen bond to a tetrahydrofuran solvate molecule, with
O(2)···O(4) = 2.64(1) Å. The two molecules of
the dimer are again related by an inversion center, so they form a
racemic dimer by self-discrimination. The hydrogen bond pairs in both 2a and 10 are described using a graph set notation
as R22(8).

O(1)···O(2A) 2.74(1), O(2)···O(4) =
2.64(1) Å.

Three of the complexes
studied form supramolecular polymers, two
(complexes 3 and 9) by forming intermolecular
OH···Br bonds and one (complex 4) by forming
intermolecular OH···N(py) bonds. The molecular structure
of complex 4 is shown in Figure 5. It can be seen that the carboxylic acid
and the nitrogen atom of the free pyridyl group are oriented away
from one another. This conformation is suited to the formation of
a supramolecular polymer through OH···N hydrogen bonding,
as illustrated in Figure 6, with intermolecular distances O(2)···N(4A)
= N(4)···O(2B) = 2.75(1) Å. All platinum centers
in a polymer chain have the same chirality, and so the polymer is
formed by self-recognition between units of 4. The space
group is not chiral, so there are equal numbers of polymer chains
with the individual platinum centers in clockwise (C) or anticlockwise
(A) configurations.

The molecular structure of complex 3 (Figure 7) is similar to that
of complex 4 (Figure 5), except for the orientation of the carboxylic acid
group. This
difference arises because complex 4 has an extra methylene
spacer group. This change leads to a different supramolecular polymeric
structure formed by intermolecular OH···BrPt hydrogen
bonding in 3 (Figure 8, (O1)···Br(1B) = O(1A)···Br(1)
= 3.19(1) Å) compared to OH···N(py) hydrogen bonding
in 4 (Figure 6). Individual molecules in each polymer chain lie on a 2-fold
screw axis and, as for complex 3, they have the same
chirality.

The molecular structure of the
3-benzylboronic acid derivative 9 is shown in Figure 9. One proton of the
B(OH)2 groups acts as a weak
hydrogen bond donor to an acetone solvate molecule, with O(2)···O(3)
= 3.20(2) Å. Similar bonding has been observed in the self-association
of several other boronic acid derivatives. The second BOH group in
complex 9 forms a weak, intermolecular hydrogen bond
to the PtBr group of a neighboring molecule, with distance O(1)···Br(1A)
= 3.37(1) Å, and propagation of this motif gives a supramolecular
polymer, as illustrated in Figure 10. As for the supramolecular polymers of 3 and 4, all platinum centers in a given polymer chain
have the same chirality.

Conclusions
The
dimethylplatinum(II) complex, 1, typically undergoes
trans oxidative addition reactions with alkyl and benzyl bromide derivatives
with hydrogen bonding substituents to yield the corresponding chiral
organoplatinum(IV) complexes as racemates. The only complications
arose with 3-bromopropionic acid, which contains β-hydrogen
atoms and which gave mostly the platinum(II) product expected if the
oxidative addition is followed by β-elimination and reductive
elimination, and with bromoacetic acid, which gave products of both
cis and trans oxidative addition.

The structures of six platinum(IV)
complexes were determined. The
aim was to study selectivity of hydrogen bonding which might occur
between the hydrogen bond donor and any of three acceptor groups,
namely, an oxygen atom of the hydrogen bonding group itself, the free
pyridyl nitrogen atom or the bromide ligand. The hydrogen bonding
might occur intramolecularly or intermolecularly, and the intermolecular
hydrogen bonding might occur to give supramolecular dimers or polymers
and might involve self-recognition or self-discrimination. The broad
conclusion is that there is a fine balance and that all outcomes are
possible. For the one monomer, complex 7, there is a
good fit to bring the alcohol and free pyridine groups in close proximity
to form an intramolecular hydrogen bond (Figure 2). The only other complex that has sufficient
flexibility to allow a similar interaction is complex 4, but here the spacer group is too long and the intermolecular OH···N(pyridyl)
hydrogen bond is formed instead to yield a supramolecular polymer
(Figures 5 and 6). Two complexes 2a (Figure 3) and 10 (Figure 4) form complementary
hydrogen bonds between pairs of CO2H or B(OH)2 groups, respectively. These therefore form supramolecular dimers,
and both form by self-discrimination to give racemic dimers. Two complexes 3 (Figures 7 and 8) and 9 (Figures 9 and 10) form supramolecular polymers through COH···Br or
BOH···Br hydrogen bonding, and both form by self-recognition
to form chiral polymer chains.

An illustrative density functional
theory calculation for complex 3 gives the filled orbital
energies Br, −5.1 eV, N(py)
−6.8 eV, O(C=O) −7.0 eV, and Hirshfeld atomic
charges Br, −0.32 e, O(C=O) −0.28 e, N(py) −0.13
e. On the basis of both orbital energy and atomic charge, hydrogen
bonding to bromide might be predicted, but hydrogen bonds are strongest
with small electronegative atoms and bromide is large. The orbital
energy favors nitrogen over oxygen as an acceptor, but the atomic
charge favors oxygen over nitrogen. It is therefore understandable
that, overall, the three potential acceptors have about equal affinity
for the hydrogen bond donor. The preferred supramolecular structure
depends on the orientation of the hydrogen bonding group and probably
on other weak bonding forces in forming the solid state lattice.9,10

Experimental Section
Reagents and General Procedures
All reactions were
carried out in an inert atmosphere of dry nitrogen using standard
Schlenk techniques at room temperature, unless otherwise specified.
All solvents used for air and moisture sensitive materials were purified
using an Innovative Technology Inc. PURE SOLV solvent purification
system (SPS). Complex 1 was prepared as previously reported.7 NMR spectra were recorded using Varian Mercury
400 or Varian Inova 400 or 600 spectrometers. Complete assignment
of each compound was aided by the use of 1H–1H NOESY, 1H–13C{1H}-HSQC,
and 1H–1H gCOSY experiments as required.
The standard labeling scheme for aromatic rings is used when labeling
NMR resonances, with rings a and b referring to coordinated and free
pyridyl groups, respectively, and ring c to other aryl rings (Chart 1). Mass spectrometric
analysis was carried out using an electrospray PE-Sciex mass spectrometer
(ESI-MS) coupled with a TOF detector.

Chart 1 Scheme for NMR Labels
X-ray Crystallography11
A suitable crystal of each compound
was coated in Paratone oil and
mounted on a glass fiber loop. X-ray data were collected at 150 K
using either a Bruker Smart APEX II diffractometer or a Nonius Kappa-CCD
diffractometer using graphite-monochromated Mo (Kα) radiation
(λ = 0.71073 Å). Unit cell parameters were calculated and
refined from the full data set. Reflections were scaled and corrected
for absorption effects. Structures were solved by either Patterson
or direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares techniques.
All nonhydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. The hydrogen atoms
were placed in calculated positions and refined using the riding model.

The cyclooctane ring showed disorder in complexes 3 and 4, leading to apparent intramolecular H···H
contacts. There is a water molecule of solvation for complex 7 which was treated as an isolated O-atom because the positions
of the H-atoms were not resolved. For complex 9, there
was unresolved disorder of the free 2-pyridyl group, leading to anomalous
thermal parameters for the ring atoms.
