This study describes
the UV solution photodeposition of several
earth-abundant 3d transition metals (Co, Ni, and Cu) onto the surface
of nanoparticulate TiO2. Irradiated methanolic metal dichloride
solutions with suspended Degussa P25-TiO2 (1–2 wt
% metal to TiO2) yield visibly colored titanias, whereas
the bulk TiO2 structure is unchanged; X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy confirms that metals are present on the titania surface
in either reduced metal (Cu/Cu+) or metal cation states
(Co2+ and Ni2+), and UV–vis diffuse reflectance
spectroscopy shows new visible absorbance features. The analyzed bulk
metal contents (∼0.04–0.6 at. %, highest for copper)
are lower than the nominal metal solution content. Mixed-metal solution
photodeposition reactions roughly parallel observations for single
metals, with copper deposition being most favored. These 3d metal
surface-modified titanias show significant (∼5–15×)
improvement in UV photocatalytic H2 evolution versus unmodified
TiO2. H2 evolution rates as high as 85 μmol/h
(8500 μmol h–1 g–1) were
detected for Cu-coated TiO2 using continuous monitoring
of reactor headspace gases by portable mass spectrometry. Control
experiments verify the necessity of the methanol sacrificial oxidant
in both metal deposition and H2 evolution. In situ metal
surface deposition is quickly followed by enhanced H2 evolution
relative to TiO2, but at lower levels than isolated metal
surface-modified titanias. The photodeposited 3d metal species on
the TiO2 surface likely act to reduce electron–hole
recombination by facilitating the transfer of photoinduced TiO2 conduction band electrons to protons in solution that are
reduced to H2. This study demonstrates a facile method
to modify photoactive TiO2 nanoparticles with inexpensive
3d transition metals to improve photocatalytic hydrogen evolution,
and it shows the utility of quantitative real-time gas evolution monitoring
by portable mass spectrometry.

Introduction
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a well-studied semiconducting
material for photocatalysis and has promise in solar energy conversion.1−4 Anatase TiO2 (Eg = 3.2 eV)
can perform the photolysis of water into hydrogen and oxygen gases
in an electrochemical cell.5 The deposition
of platinum metal on the surface of anatase TiO2 forms
a highly active UV photochemical water-splitting catalyst.6−8 Platinum metal regions on titania act as a surface catalyst that
funnels photoexcited TiO2 conduction band (CB) electrons
to protons in solution that are reduced to H2. In these
types of photocatalytic reactions, a sacrificial oxidant is needed
to remove photogenerated holes from the semiconductor valence band
(VB) and maintain overall charge balance.9,10 However,
even at low cocatalyst concentrations (∼1 wt %), platinum has
disadvantages related to its high cost and low abundance.

There
have been extensive efforts to improve the photochemical
properties of TiO2-based materials that do not involve
noble metal cocatalysts and may also enable absorption of solar radiation
for water-splitting hydrogen production.11 A wide range of metals (Cu,12,13 Ni,14 Co,15 Cr, Fe, Mo, V, and W16) and nonmetals (N,17 F,18 P,19 and
S20) have been doped into the bulk structure
of TiO2 by solution or solid-state methods to modify the
bulk titania band structure and improve visible light absorption or
electron–hole charge recombination kinetics. Most prior work
has used gas-phase H2 or solution-phase NaBH4 reduction of metal ions mixed with TiO2 precursors. We
previously incorporated ∼5–10 at. % of several 3d metals
into rutile TiO2 via exothermic solid-state metathesis
reactions.21 These metathesis-derived titanias
showed lower photoactivity versus undoped materials, though 3d metals
gave visible color to the products. Modifying TiO2 with
two metals in its bulk structure, such as Co/Ni or Cu/Ce, has been
studied for photocatalytic applications in dye degradation and water
splitting.22,23 CuO coatings or intimate copper
oxide mixtures with TiO2 exhibit partial reduction of copper
oxide during observed enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.24,25

Photodeposition has been utilized for the removal of metal
ions
from aqueous environments with semiconducting WO3 or TiO2 as photoactive substrates.26−31 In addition to environmental remediation, photoassisted deposition
can also function as a potentially facile low-temperature method to
modify photoactive surfaces such as TiO2 with metal or
metal oxide cocatalysts.8 Copper and nickel
have shown promise as photodeposited cocatalysts or in situ catalysts
for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution using high-surface area titania
nanotubes or mesoporous structures.32−34 This paper describes
the UV photodeposition of several 3d metals (Co, Ni, and Cu) onto
the surface of commercial photoactive Degussa P25-TiO2 (primarily
anatase) using a method analogous to noble metal (e.g., Ag and Pt)
photoreduction processes. The bulk titania structure and particle
morphologies after 3d metal surface modification are unchanged. The
surface and optical properties of the modified TiO2 were
investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and UV–vis
spectroscopy. XPS surface compositions are compared to bulk chemical
analysis by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy
(ICP–OES) to better analyze the metal deposition process. Real-time
reactor headspace gas analysis by portable residual gas analysis mass
spectrometry (RGA–MS) was used to quantify the photoactivity
of these catalysts for hydrogen production. The 3d metal surface-modified
TiO2 materials show significant improvements in the photoreduction
of water to hydrogen gas to levels approaching half of that of similarly
prepared platinum-coated titanias.

Results and Discussion
Photochemical
M:TiO2 Synthesis
Commercial
Degussa P25-TiO2 nanoparticles (∼50 nm, 80:20 anatase–rutile)
were surface-modified with the 3d metals nickel, cobalt, and copper
using solution UV photoreduction in the presence of a sacrificial
methanol oxidant. P25-TiO2 was dispersed in a 50 vol %
aqueous methanol solution containing dissolved metal dichlorides.
The solution was degassed with argon prior to UV irradiation to favor
inert (nonoxidizing) conditions. The initial solutions contained sufficient
metal chlorides to deposit either 1 or 2 wt % metal onto the suspended
titania powder. Following UV exposure, the titania suspension had
darkened in color (e.g., gray Ni:TiO2 and purple Cu:TiO2) and the washed and dried M:TiO2 solids were light
gray (Ni) or light blue (Co and Cu). When two different metals were
present in the photodeposition solution (Co/Ni, Co/Cu, and Ni/Cu),
the M:TiO2 products had a light blue coloration, similar
to the Cu and Co products. Comparable visible titania colorations
were observed for the nominal 1 and 2 wt % metal loadings. Each product
is identified by metal and nominal metal loading as M(x%):TiO2, for example, Ni(1%):TiO2.

M:TiO2 Structure, Composition, and Surface Analysis
Powder X-ray
diffraction (XRD) of the photodeposited M:TiO2 products
shows predominately anatase TiO2 with
a small rutile component in ratios that are unchanged from the starting
P25-TiO2 (Figure S1). No additional
XRD peaks corresponding to other metals or metal oxide phases were
observed, suggesting that they are present in amounts below the few
percent XRD detection limits or they are on the surface in a noncrystalline
form. The photochemical reactions between P25-TiO2 and
metal halide solutions also did not lead to detectable physical changes
in the titania powders. A Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
surface area of 44.8 m2/g was measured for P25-TiO2, which is essentially the same as the 44.6 m2/g
surface area measured for a surface-modified Cu(1%):TiO2 sample. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis also showed
that the original TiO2 particle sizes near 50 nm are retained
in the Cu(1%):TiO2 photoproduct (Figure 1). Aggregated small particles near 50 nm
are similarly observed for Ni and Co deposition products (Figure S8).

Figure 1 SEM images of P25-TiO2 (top)
and a Cu(1%):TiO2 photoreaction product (bottom).

Bulk elemental analysis using
ICP–OES detected the metals
deposited onto TiO2, and the M:Ti atomic ratios are summarized
in Table 1. At the
targeted 1 wt % metal loading, the ideal M:Ti atomic ratio would be
1.3:98.7 (2.6:97.4 for 2 wt %) if all of the metal present in solution
was deposited onto the P25-TiO2 particle surface. Cobalt
and nickel were detected at less than 10% of the ideal 1 wt % loading
value, whereas copper approached half of the ideal loading. In the
mixed-metal samples, the cobalt and nickel content remained low (<0.07
at. % vs Ti), whereas the amount of copper was closer to its ideal
content based on solution concentrations; thus, the photodeposition
of copper onto semiconducting TiO2 is favored over the
other metals. A doubling of the metal chloride solution concentration
to 2 wt % did not result in a doubling of metal product content. Similar
metal deposition trends have been observed in related photochemical
contexts.34 These surface deposition results
are consistent with metal activity series trends and reduction potentials
(M2+ + 2e– → M with ease of reduction
Cu > 2H ≫ Ni > Co); for example, copper is most easily
reduced
of the three metal cations and protons.35 Copper is also the only one of the three metal cations that is easier
to reduce than H+ to H2. In the photoassisted
solution reduction process, it is generally accepted that a sacrificial
methanol oxidant interacts with the VB holes in photoexcited TiO2 while the photoexcited CB electrons in TiO2 are
used for solution H+ to H2 reduction and also
surface metal reduction (e.g., Cu2+ → Cu+/Cu0). This catalytic redox cycle parallels the mechanisms
used for platinum-coated titanias produced by UV photoreduction of
PtCl62– in methanol solutions.

Surface
composition and chemical environment were examined for
select M:TiO2 products using surface-sensitive XPS. For
the nominal 1–2 wt % metal concentrations, signals were observable
for Co, Ni, and Cu, though the Co and Ni contents were low and required
longer sampling times to detect weak signals for these metals above
the baseline. Figure 2 shows the 2p3/2 spectra for Ti, Co, Ni, and Cu peaks
in representative M(2%):TiO2 samples (additional spectra
are in Supporting Information Figure S2). Table 1 summarizes the XPS
peak positions and relative atomic ratios of the surface metal species.
As compared to the bulk ICP composition results, XPS shows higher
M:Ti surface atomic ratios. Because the metal species are photodeposited
on the surface, rather than being homogenously distributed through
the TiO2 structure, it is consistent that the XPS surface
composition yields a higher M:Ti atomic ratio than bulk analysis.
For the mixed-metal samples, Co(1%)/Ni(1%):TiO2 has Co
and Ni contents similar to what was observed in the individual Co(1%)
and Ni(1%):TiO2 samples. In contrast, the mixed-metal samples
containing Cu showed no detectable Co or Ni, which is consistent with
the bulk ICP results showing decreased photodeposition of Co and Ni
when Cu is present in solution. The mixed-metal results provide further
support for the ease of copper ion photoreduction onto semiconducting
TiO2 as compared to Co and Ni ions.

Figure 2 Representative XPS spectra
for 2p doublets for Ti from Cu(2%):TiO2, Co from Co(2%):TiO2, Ni from Ni(2%):TiO2, and Cu from Cu(2%):TiO2.

In addition to surface-sensitive
compositions, XPS provides useful
information about the nature of the metals deposited on the surface.
As shown in the results in Table 1, in all M:TiO2 samples, the Ti 2p3/2 peak is between 458.4 and 459.0 eV, agreeing with a Ti4+ environment for TiO2. For reference, the starting P25-TiO2 has a Ti 2p3/2 peak centered at 458.2 eV. The
O 1s spectra show a major peak at 530.2 eV in all samples, also consistent
with the oxide anion for TiO2. The other metal peak positions
were used to help determine their chemical states on the TiO2 surface. The 2p3/2 peak positions of Co and Ni on P25-TiO2 are close to their M2+ reference positions (e.g.,
MO, M(OH)2, or MCl2) with a small peak near
M3+ reference energies in the Co case. In contrast, the
2p3/2 peak in Cu samples indicates that the metal has been
reduced on the surface to Cu0/Cu+ states (e.g.,
Cu2O or CuCl), which is consistent with related work on
copper-coated titanias.24,39 As noted above, Cu
is more readily photodeposited onto P25-TiO2 than Co or
Ni, and XPS compositional analysis supports the idea that the ease
of Cu2+ reduction leads to higher surface deposition. The
Co(1%)/Ni(1%):TiO2 sample has a nickel peak position similar
to those of comparable Ni2+ peaks observed in the Ni:TiO2 samples, but the cobalt peak appeared at a slightly higher
energy near a Co3+ state. The mixed-metal samples show
that Cu is still in a Cu0/Cu+ state, though
the Ni(1%)/Cu(1%):TiO2 sample may have some Cu2+ character. In related studies, chemically precipitated Cu(OH)2 or Ni(OH)2 clusters onto the P25-TiO2 surface show similar 2p3/2 shifts from 935 to 933 eV
as surface Cu2+ transforms to metallic Cu and a Ni peak
at 856 eV is attributed to surface Ni2+.40,41 Chlorine is also present on the titania surface after photoreaction
with metal chloride solutions, and higher surface chlorine is detected
for Co and Ni cations versus partially reduced Cu products (Table S2). This is consistent with metal cations
deposited or reacted with oxide surface sites that are accompanied
by chloride anions while reduced Cu on the titania surface requires
less chloride anion charge balance.

Optical Properties of M:TiO2
UV−vis
diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) spectra for the M:TiO2 samples relative to P25-TiO2 show that the 3d metal surface
modification leads to visible colors and apparent new absorption events
in the red or orange regions as well as a slightly lower energy band
gap absorption energy (Eg). Figure 3 shows the raw reflectance
data and Tauc plot for P25-TiO2 along with M(2%):TiO2 products. Each of the M:TiO2 samples shows a band
gap absorption shift to lower Eg near
2.9 eV from 3.2 eV for P25-TiO2. Cu:TiO2 samples
show a decrease in reflectance at wavelengths above 600 nm, correlating
with its light blue color. For comparison, a blue CuCl2 solution has an absorbance maximum at 800 nm corresponding to d–d
electronic transitions. Similar absorption near 700–800 nm
are observed for Cu(OH)2 deposited onto TiO2.41 The Co:TiO2 samples show
decreased reflectance from 520 to 680 nm, similar to CoCl2 solutions with an absorbance maximum near 500 nm. The light gray-colored
Ni:TiO2 samples exhibit a broad decrease in total reflectance
across the visible spectrum relative to P25-TiO2. The spectra
for M(1%):TiO2 and M(1%)/M′(1%):TiO2 samples
show similar absorption events and trends (see Figures S3 and S4). The increase in visible absorptions and
band gap decrease may be due to nanoscale surface plasmon resonance
effects,33,42 whereas others have ascribed these optical
transitions to charge transfer between TiO2 bands and the
surface-deposited metal species.40,41

Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution with M:TiO2
Photocatalytic hydrogen gas evolution from aqueous methanol solutions
was quantified in real time using RGA–MS for different M:TiO2 samples under UV irradiation with methanol serving as a sacrificial
oxidant. Calibration curves for the H2/Ar headspace mass
analysis data allowed direct conversion to molar quantities of evolved
hydrogen (Figures S5 and S6). The use of
direct mass quantification by RGA–MS allowed continuous measurement
of rates of H2 produced, and it yielded similar evolution
rates for Pt(1%):TiO2, reported by gas chromatography analysis.43 For comparison, photocatalytic hydrogen gas
evolution was determined for highly active platinum-coated titania,
Pt(1%):TiO2, and unmodified P25-TiO2, which
yielded average H2 evolution rates of 200 and 5 μmol/h,
respectively (for our 10 mg samples: 20 000 and 500 μmol
h–1 g–1). Each M:TiO2 sample showed considerably higher H2 evolution rates
than the P25-TiO2 starting material, and multiple cycle
data for M(1%):TiO2 samples are shown in Figure 4. Similar cycling data for
M(2%):TiO2 and mixed-metal systems are shown in Figure S7.

Figure 4 Real-time hydrogen gas evolution for M(1%):TiO2 (10
mg of samples in 50 mL of 50 vol % aqueous methanol) directly measured
using an RGA–MS capillary probe in the reactor during UV illumination.
H2 production was measured during 1 hour illumination cycles
followed by a 10 min argon flush. The sequential illumination cycles
began at the 30, 100, 170, and 240 min marks.

Each M:TiO2 catalyst was tested in several 1 hour
cycles
of UV exposure in the same aqueous methanol solution, and the average
hourly hydrogen evolution data are summarized in Table 2. The hourly H2 evolution
rates for most samples across the multiple cycles showed small deviation.
The samples with the least stability were Co(1%):TiO2 and
Ni(2%):TiO2, where H2 evolution dropped by 30–50%
after the third cycle. The Cu(1%):TiO2 sample had the highest
hydrogen evolution rate of 85 μmol/h (8500 μmol h–1 g–1), which is comparable to or
greater than prior studies of copper deposition on porous or nanoscale
titanias with H2 evolution in range from 1500 to 8000 μmol
h–1 g–124,33,34 or to the structural incorporation of Cu
or Ni with 1100–4300 μmol h–1 g–1.14,25 Though Cu(1%):TiO2 was more active than Cu(2%):TiO2, both Cu-modified samples
had very stable H2 production for several cycles. The Cu:TiO2 samples show higher activity than the Co:TiO2 and
Ni:TiO2 photocatalysts, though this may be due to the higher
amount of Cu deposition based on the ICP results. Scaling hydrogen
evolution activity to the amount of metal cocatalyst present indicates
that Co(1%):TiO2 is the most active at 8400 μmol
h–1 mg–1 Co, whereas Cu(1%):TiO2 has an activity of 2400 μmol h–1 mg–1 Cu. The calculated quantum yields (QYs) from the
broad spectrum UV illumination are generally similar (∼1–20%
range) to those reported in other Cu or Ni surface-modified titanias.34,40,41

There was
no synergistic photocatalyst effect observed for the
titania surface-modified with both Ni and Co as the activity for the
mixed-metal sample was similar to or lower than that of the individual
M(1%):TiO2 products. Although the addition of a second
photodeposited metal (Co or Ni) species onto TiO2 does
enhance copper photodeposition, this may lead to higher surface metal
coatings that inhibit hydrogen evolution activity by favoring redox
reactions of the surface metal species (e.g., Cu+/Cu) or
blocking the illumination of the titania core. On the basis of the
results in Table 2 for
M(1%)/Cu(1%):TiO2, addition of Ni2+ to the Cu+/Cu-photodeposited coating has less negative impact on hydrogen
production versus the Co2+ addition. There are many variables
that prevent direct comparisons with other related metal-coated heterojunction
titanias, but Table 3 compares several other studies with the current work.

a Ideal mol % metal is noted based
on ideal M/TiO2 solution content, if bulk analysis is not
reported.

In the results
in Table 3, some cases
note the ideal amount of metal that could be
deposited onto TiO2 from solution where bulk chemical analysis
was not available. The metal salt solutions vary from using nonoxidizing
chloride anions to potentially reducible sulfate and nitrates anions.
As P25-TiO2 alone only yields ∼500 μmol h–1 g–1 of H2 in aqueous
UV photocatalytic reactions with a methanol sacrificial oxidant, the
wide range of surface deposition strategies in Table 3 all show enhanced H2 evolution
abilities with various illumination strategies and oxidants.

Recycling tests were performed after recovering M(1%):TiO2 samples and testing the activity in new aqueous methanol solutions.
All M:TiO2 samples retained enhanced hydrogen evolution,
though at lower activity than the initial cycling tests. As an example,
Cu(1%):TiO2 had an average rate of 62 μmol/h during
a recycle test, roughly 73% of the average activity of the initial
cycles. During several catalyst recycle runs, the individual cycles
were fairly consistent (see Table S4, Supporting Information). Postreaction XPS analysis was used to check for
changes in the catalyst surface composition (Table S3). Cu(2%):TiO2 showed an ∼70% decrease
in the Cu:Ti atomic ratio to 1.1:98.9, but no change in the Cu 2p3/2 peak position. The Co(2%) and Ni(2%) samples did not show
clearly identifiable surface metal peaks in the postreaction analysis,
thought the solids retained some of their initial color. This loss
of surface metal may be related to the decrease in activity over the
initial cycles as well as the drop in activity during the recycle
tests for these catalysts. In related CuO/TiO2 photocatalytic
systems, it was determined that photocorrosion of chemically deposited
copper occurs during UV hydrogen evolution photocatalysis along with
possible competing reverse photodeposition of some dissolved copper.32

In the Ti 2p3/2 spectrum of
Ni(1%)/Cu(1%):TiO2, a small peak appeared at 454.9 eV,
which is consistent with the
presence of reduced Ti3+ on the surface of this sample.36 The presence of Ti3+ sites on TiO2 has been associated with enhanced photoreduction abilities.44,45 As noted earlier, the copper photodeposition preference may be due
to its ease in reduction relative to Co2+, Ni2+, or H+. The Ti4+/Ti3+ reduction
is slightly less favored than H+, and control experiments
with P25-TiO2 alone under UV illumination in methanol solution
show no visible change in color or enhanced hydrogen evolution activity
(see the P25-TiO2 sample in Figure 4).35 Thus, if
present, Ti3+ is not generated in the absence of other
metals under the conditions of this work. Given that chloride ions
are present on the surface after photodeposition reactions in metal
halide solutions, another control experiment with P25-TiO2 was performed in the presence of NaCl(aq) under the same aqueous
methanol/UV conditions. No detectable changes in H2 evolution
were observed for P25-TiO2, indicating that the presence
of chloride is not a determining feature of enhanced H2 evolution from the M:TiO2 materials.

In Situ Photodeposition
and Hydrogen Evolution Studies
Several in situ photocatalytic
hydrogen evolution experiments were
run with P25-TiO2 in the presence of MCl2 in
50% methanol, equivalent to the 1% photodeposition experiments. Cycling
data are presented in Figure 5 for these single-step deposition/hydrogen evolution experiments.
These tests showed that even without the metal previously deposited
onto the TiO2 surface, hydrogen gas is produced very quickly,
once some metal surface photodeposition occurs. After the first in
situ cycle for CuCl2, the titania catalyst developed its
characteristic blue color. The in situ copper chloride photocatalytic
test showed an average hydrogen evolution rate of 29 μmol/h
(2900 μmol h–1 g–1, 5 times
higher than that of P25-TiO2 alone), which is higher than
those observed in other in situ Cu:TiO2 studies (∼1500
μmol h–1 g–1),34 but about one-third of that observed for the
isolated Cu(1%):TiO2 material described above. Related
titania experiments have shown that the addition of copper sulfate
to a titania suspension also improves the rate of hydrogen evolution
to 2200 μmol h–1 g–1.33 The initial rates for the in situ Co and Ni
tests were comparable to the values for the isolated Co(1%) and Ni(1%):TiO2 materials but dropped in activity over four cycles. This
loss of activity is comparable to that observed for the isolated Co(1%):TiO2 sample, but the activity of the isolated Ni(1%):TiO2 catalyst was more stable under UV photocatalytic cycling than that
shown by the in situ test.

Figure 5 In situ metal deposition and hydrogen evolution
data; average rates
for all four cycles (μmol/h) are Co 12.2, Ni 15.8, and Cu 28.3.
H2 production was measured during 1 h illumination cycles
followed by a 10 min argon flush. Each illumination cycle began at
the 30, 100, 170, and 240 min marks.

An in situ Cu(1%):TiO2 experiment was also performed
in 18 MΩ water to verify the importance of methanol as a sacrificial
oxidant in this photochemical reaction. Two UV illumination cycles
(P25-TiO2, 1 wt % CuCl2, pure water) were run
without methanol, and there were no visible titania color change and
no detectable H2 production by RGA–MS analysis (Figure 6). After the second
illumination cycle, methanol was spiked into solution and this produced
detectable H2 evolution and a titania color change observed
during the third UV illumination cycle. This test confirmed the importance
of a sacrificial oxidant for both photoassisted copper surface deposition/reduction
and hydrogen generation processes.

hydrogen evolution in 18
MΩ water. First UV lamp cycle begins near 30 min and ends at
90 min. Reactor headspace was flushed with argon between UV illumination
runs. Second UV lamp cycle begins at 100 min and ends at 160 min.
Methanol is spiked into solution during the argon flush prior to the
third cycle.

Photocatalytic Considerations
The CB energy for anatase
TiO2 is energetically well-suited for the solution reduction
of H+ to H2. One of the primary limitations
on its activity is the fast charge recombination of photoexcited electrons
in the CB with holes in the VB before they are utilized in external
redox reactions. The addition of metal or metal oxide to the TiO2 surface provides a pathway to transfer photogenerated electrons
from the TiO2 CB to the surface-bound metal (or metal ion)
cocatalyst that facilitates hydrogen reduction. In the absence of
a photocatalyst, the overall reaction of CH3OH with water
to produce CO2 and H2 is a thermochemically
uphill process with a calculated ΔHrxn of +53 kJ/mol using standard enthalpy of formation values. One study
estimated an endothermic free energy of +16 kJ/mol for this reaction
in the absence of a catalyst.13 On the
basis of the relatively low energy redox processes for Co, Ni, and
Cu ions in solution and metals on titania particles, the enhanced
photocatalytic activity of these heterojunction semiconductor composites
is usually attributed to the 3d metal engaging in surface redox reactions
that lead to H+ to H2 reduction. During UV illumination,
there is a continuous flow of CB electrons from TiO2 to
the surface metal cocatalyst, enabling reduction processes, which
could transiently involve the metal (e.g., metal oxide to metal particles)
as well as the H+/H2 reduction. Given the different
reduction potentials for Co and Ni versus Cu, there may be different
surface reactions occurring, for example, H2 from Ni or
Co systems via transient production of nanoscale metals that reoxidize
during H2 production versus H2 production from
metallic copper particle surfaces. These general heterojunction photoreactions
have been proposed in several related previous systems.33,34,40,41 The general reaction steps described for these photocatalytic redox
reactions are 1   2   3   4  

In this work, the lower activity of
our photodeposited M:TiO2 samples for Co or Ni versus Cu
can be attributed to the (a) differing amounts of metal species on
the TiO2 surface and (b) differences in metal ion redox
activity versus hydrogen reduction. In this photocatalytic metal species
deposition, there appears to be an upper limit for metal deposition
that competes with hydrogen gas formation. Other studies have also
shown that catalytic activity of surface-deposited metals or metal
oxides/hydroxides peaks at a low metal content (∼0.2–0.5
mol % M) and then drops in activity overlap of reactive surface sites,
such as with Ni(OH)2 and Cu(OH)2 cluster depositions
on TiO2.40,41

As demonstrated in the
in situ test, the presence of methanol plays
a crucial supporting role in the overall photocatalytic reaction.
While hydrogen is reduced, methanol is oxidized stepwise to formaldehyde
and formic acid by holes in the VB of TiO2, eventually
forming CO2.13,46 This occurs in preference
to the oxidation of water, which would limit overall hydrogen production
because of the back reaction between hydrogen and oxygen.

Conclusions
This paper describes a facile method of modifying commercial P25-TiO2 to improve its activity for photocatalytic hydrogen production.
The photodeposition of Co, Ni, or Cu onto the surface of TiO2 led to visible optical absorption properties. Compositional analysis
showed that low metal contents (∼0.04–1 at. % of bulk
material, highest for copper) are photodeposited onto the TiO2 surface, but this surface modification is sufficient to show
beneficial effects on the utilization of titania CB electrons for
photocatalytic hydrogen reduction using methanol as a sacrificial
oxidant. The rate of UV photocatalytic hydrogen production was improved
to as high as 8500 μmol h–1 g–1 (7% QY) for Cu(1%):TiO2 versus 500 μmol h–1 g–1 (0.4% QY) for P25-TiO2. Direct
atmospheric-pressure headspace gas sampling by portable mass spectrometry
was demonstrated as a useful portable tool for real-time monitoring
of reactor headspaces and quantification of hydrogen gas production.

Experimental
Section
Materials
TiO2 (Degussa P25, ∼50
nm size and 45 m2/g), CoCl2·6H2O (Aldrich, reagent grade), NiCl2·6H2O
(Aldrich, ReagentPlus), CuCl2·2H2O (Aldrich,
99+%), H2PtCl6·6H2O (99.9%,
Strem), methanol (ACS certified, Fisher), deionized water (18 MΩ).

Single-Metal-Modified TiO2
In a 50 mL Erlenmeyer
flask, 4 mg (0.017 mmol) of MCl2·6H2O (M
= Co or Ni) or 3 mg (0.017 mmol) of CuCl2·2H2O was dissolved in 30 mL of 50 vol % aqueous methanol. TiO2 (100 mg, 1.25 mmol) was added to the solution. The flask was covered
with a septum, and the solution was degassed with argon while stirring.
The flask was exposed to a water-jacketed UV light (450 W Hg lamp,
Ace-Hanovia) for 90 min under an argon blanket. Solids were isolated
by centrifugation (3000 rpm), rinsed once with methanol, centrifuged
again, and then dried in air. The product from nominal 1 wt % metal
relative to TiO2 was denoted as M(1%):TiO2.
The photodeposition reaction was also run with twice the initial amount
of MCl2, and the products are denoted as M(2%):TiO2.

Mixed-Metal-Modified TiO2
In a 50 mL Erlenmeyer
flask, a combination using two of the metals (6 mg (0.035 mmol) of
CuCl2·2H2O, 8 mg (0.034 mmol) of CoCl2·6H2O, or 8 mg (0.034 mmol) of NiCl2·6H2O) was dissolved in 30 mL of 50 vol % aqueous
methanol. TiO2 (200 mg, 2.5 mmol) was added to the solution.
The flask was covered with a septum, and the solution was degassed
with argon while stirring. The flask was exposed to UV light for 90
min under an argon blanket. Solids were isolated by centrifugation
(3000 rpm), rinsed once with methanol, centrifuged again, and then
dried in air. These mixed-metal products each had nominal 1 wt % metal
relative to TiO2 and are denoted M(1%)/M′(1%):TiO2.

Platinum-Modified TiO2
In a 50 mL Erlenmeyer
flask, 2.4 mg (0.006 mmol) of H2PtCl6 was dissolved
in 30 mL of 50 vol % aqueous methanol. TiO2 (100 mg, 1.25
mmol) was added to the solution. The flask was covered with a septum,
and the solution was degassed with argon while stirring. The flask
was exposed to UV light (450 W Hg) for 90 min under an argon blanket.
Solids were isolated by centrifugation (3000 rpm), rinsed with methanol,
and dried in air. This platinum loading is nominal 1 wt % Pt relative
to TiO2 and is denoted Pt(1%):TiO2.

Product Characterization
A Bruker D8 DaVinci powder
X-ray diffractometer was used for analysis of powders uniformly placed
on glass slides (Cu Kα, 0.0504°/s step). XPS was performed
on a Kratos Axis Ultra XPS (Al Kα) with samples mounted on carbon
tape. XPS peak analysis was performed using CasaXPS software (www.casaxps.com). ICP–OES
(PerkinElmer Optima DV 7000) was used for bulk elemental analysis.
Samples were dissolved in a heated 5:1 mixture of concentrated H2SO4:HNO3 and diluted with 5% HNO3. Calibration standards were prepared from 1000 ppm commercial
ICP standards for Ti, Co, Cu (Alfa Aesar), and Ni (Fluka). UV–vis
DRS spectra were collected on a Cary 5000 Series spectrophotometer
(300–800 nm, 10 nm/s). Raw reflectance data were converted
to Kubelka–Munk units [F(R)], and band gaps were calculated using [F(R) × E]1/2 extrapolations
of linear regions of the curve. SEM images were collected on a Hitachi
S-4800 FE-SEM with an accelerating voltage of 1.3 kV. Samples were
mounted on aluminum stubs using carbon tape and were not coated prior
to analysis. BET surface area measurements were collected on a Quantachrome
NOVA 1200 using approximately 50 mg of solid sample.

Photocatalytic
Hydrogen Evolution
Reactions were carried
out in a 50 mL Schlenk flask containing 10 mg (0.125 mmol) of the
titania catalyst suspended in 10 mL of 50 vol % aqueous methanol solution.
The reactor was purged with argon and connected to the capillary of
a Stanford Research Systems quadrupole mass spectrometer 300 series
residual gas analyzer via the flask side arm. Masses corresponding
to N2 (28), Ar (40), H2 (2), O2 (32),
and H2O (18) were monitored as a function of time. The
flask remained under a constant blanket of argon for the entire experiment,
supplied from a Schlenk line with an oil bubbler. Following a period
of 30 min for instrument and background stabilization, the flask was
illuminated with a UV lamp in 60 min cycles with an approximate photon
flux of 4.0 × 1017 photon s–1. Details
on photon flux calculations and QY estimations are shown in the Supporting Information. Between each cycle, the
reactor was briefly opened and its headspace was flushed with argon.
Pressure signals were converted to molar amounts of evolved H2 based on a calibration curve created using known-concentration
H2/Ar mixtures (Figure S5).
The H2/Ar ratio was used to minimize errors from variation
in absolute hydrogen pressure signal values from reaction to reaction.
Micromoles of H2 present were calculated for actual headspace
volume in the reactor.

In Situ Metal Photodeposition and Hydrogen
Evolution
This experiment used the same reactor/analysis
setup as described
above. Here, 10 mg (0.125 mmol) of Degussa P25-TiO2 was
suspended in 10 mL of 50 vol % of aqueous methanol containing 4 mg
(0.017 mmol) of MCl2·6H2O (M = Co, Ni)
or 3 mg (0.017 mmol) of CuCl2·2H2O. The
reactor was purged with argon and connected to the residual gas analyzer
as described above. Following a period of 30 min for instrument and
background stabilization, the flask was illuminated with a UV lamp
in 60 min cycles. The reactor headspace was flushed with argon between
each cycle. To verify the critical nature of the methanol sacrificial
oxidant in metal deposition and hydrogen evolution, 10 mg (0.125 mmol)
of Degussa P25-TiO2 was suspended in a 10 mL solution of
18 MΩ H2O with 3 mg (0.017 mmol) of CuCl2·2H2O and was UV-irradiated for two cycles and then
2 mL of methanol was added for the third UV cycle onward.
