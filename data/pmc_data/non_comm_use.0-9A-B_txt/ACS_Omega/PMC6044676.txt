The toxicity of cadmium causes varying
degrees of risk to organisms.
The underlying mechanism has been conventionally attributed to Cd2+-ion-induced oxidative stress. Here, we propose that the
Cd2+ ion directly and stably binds with the thymine specifically
in the major groove and causes denaturation of dsDNA. Using molecular
dynamics simulations, it was found that the Cd2+ ion preferred
to bind to the thymine exposed in the major groove. This then destroyed
the hydrogen bonds between adenine and thymine, resulting in a mismatched
structure of dsDNA. Our findings are expected to promote the understanding
of cadmium-induced direct destruction of genomic stability and may
also be helpful for the facilitation of the experimental detection
of the binding sites.

Introduction
Pollution with heavy
metals has been drawing a public concern.1−3 The flood of
cadmium from nickel–cadmium batteries,4 pigments,5 chemical
stabilizers,6 metal coatings, and alloys7 has increased the probability of human exposure
to cadmium from food, water, cigarette smoking, and air contamination.8−10 There are many examples of absorbed and accumulated cadmium in the
body, which causes acute and chronic intoxication,11−13 including diverse
toxic effects on human organs, such as lungs, kidneys, liver, bone,
and the immune system.9,14−16 Additionally,
cadmium has been classified as a class 1 carcinogen by the International
Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).

Much progress has been
made in understanding the mechanism underlying
cadmium toxicity.17−22 Liu et al.20 proposed that oxidative
stress plays a crucial role in the toxicity of cadmium, where cadmium
induces an increase of the reactive oxygen species (ROS), which causes
lesions on cellular components. Shaikh et al.21 reported that cadmium causes the depletion of the components in
the antioxidant defense system, such as superoxide dismutase and glutathione.
This directly results in the accumulation of ROS and inhibition of
the antioxidant defense system. Additionally, it has also been suggested
that cadmium indirectly induces DNA lesions. Hartwig22 showed that cadmium interacts with the DNA repair proteins,
interfering with the function of the repair system, which then causes
an accumulation of mutations. Moreover, the damaged DNA repair system
further accelerates mutagenesis and genomic instability in coordination
with various types of mutagens.23−25 However, a molecular-level mechanism
underlying the direct damage from cadmium to DNA remains unclear.

Here, with an aim to investigate the interaction between cadmium
ion (Cd2+) and DNA on the nanoscale, we report the application
of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the direct interaction
of Cd2+ with dsDNA. The reason using dsDNA is to set up
a biological model for metal ions interacting with the exposed minor/major
grooves of dsDNA packed into nucleosomes, which is significantly related
to cytotoxicity, chromosomal aberrations, mutagenicity, DNA repair
pathways, and so on.17−22 We found that Cd2+ ions were bound specifically to the
thymine in the major groove, resulting in a mismatched structure.
This structure subsequently caused the denaturation of dsDNA and created
a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on both the coding and noncoding
regions of the genes.26,27 These findings are expected to
promote the understanding of the cadmium-induced destruction of genomic
stability and even the interference of cadmium in the interactions
of DNA with enzymes and transcription factors.

Results and Discussion
The adenine (A) and thymine (T) base pair is ubiquitous and rich
in the promoter region of DNA, and it plays a crucial role in replication.28−30 We chose a dsDNA sequence of poly(dA)9–poly(dT)9 with nine A–T base pairs, as shown in Figure 1, to study the binding state
of Cd2+ on dsDNA. The dsDNA has two grooves, that is, the
minor groove and major groove, as shown in Figure 1. To simulate the stochastic conformations
with Cd2+ residing around dsDNA, we performed two kinds
of MD simulations with Cd2+ initially located in the two
grooves.

Figure 1 Initial conformation of the dsDNA segment. Three cyan base pairs
are fixed in each terminal. The red and blue fragments in the middle
are the unfixed thymine and adenine bases, respectively. Owing to
the asymmetry of the dsDNA strand, the grooves in the double helix
are unequally sized.

To distinguish whether the Cd2+ ions were bound
to the
dsDNA, the minimum distances (Dm) of Cd2+ with the atom in dsDNA were counted for both minor and major
grooves. The typical trajectories of Dm for the minor and major grooves are presented in Figure 2. Initially, Cd2+ was sampled near the sequence with a small Dm (approximately 0.2 nm) for both minor and major grooves.
During the first 4 ns, with the temperature increasing from 30 to
300 K, the distances fluctuated slightly. After the temperature reached
to 300 K for 1 ns (namely, at t = 5 ns), for the
minor groove, the Dm increased sharply
to 0.4 nm and subsequently fluctuated. This meant that Cd2+ was initially located in the minor groove and then moved toward
the bulk water. For the major groove in Figure 2, however, the behavior of Cd2+ was in contrast to that in the minor groove. The Dm between Cd2+ and dsDNA weakly fluctuated
by approximately 0.21 nm, indicating that Cd2+ was stably
placed in the major groove.

Figure 2 Typical trajectories for the minimum distance
(Dm) of Cd2+ with the atom
in dsDNA during NPT
ensemble simulations for the minor groove (red) and the major groove
(blue) with the temperature as shown.

To further study Cd2+ around the sequence, we
analyzed
the Dm of Cd2+ and dsDNA based
on the MD simulations with NVT ensemble after the equilibrium process
of NPT. The typical trajectories are presented in Figure 3, showing the Dm in the minor and major grooves. We found that Cd2+ that escaped from the minor groove moved around the dsDNA
structure with an observable fluctuation of Dm. By contrast, for the major groove, Dm just slightly fluctuated by approximately 0.21 nm. Conventionally,
a rule, the Dm remains unchanged throughout
the simulation, is applied to determine the binding. Meanwhile, the
probability (Pb) of binding, defined as
the ratio of the bound times to the entire time of simulations for
both minor and major grooves, was used to quantitatively describe
the stability of the binding. As shown in Table 1, the data were obtained from twenty 200
ns simulations, and Pb was zero in the
minor groove, meaning that there was little possibility of observing
the binding in the minor groove. However, Pb was 95% in the major groove, which indicated a high possibility,
and typical duration of 102 ns of binding between Cd2+ and dsDNA occurred in the major groove. Analyzing the average Dm (ADm) of 20 simulations,
we found that the ADm was 0.65 ±
0.43 nm in the minor groove, which is clearly larger than that in
the major groove (0.21 ± 0.01 nm).

Figure 3 Typical trajectories
of the minimum distance (Dm) of Cd2+ from dsDNA during 200 ns NVT stable
simulations for the minor groove (red) and the major groove (blue).

Table 1 Comparisons between
the Minor Groove
and the Major Groove on the Probability of Successful Binding (Pb), the Average Minimum Distance (ADm) of Cd2+ dsDNA, and the Average Number of
Hydrogen Bonds (HBs) in dsDNA
groove	Pb	ADm (nm)	HB number	
minor	0	0.65 ± 0.43	18 ± 0.18	
major	0.95	0.21 ± 0.01	17 ± 0.22	
Proper HBs are essential
for dsDNA to maintain a natural conformation,
and the dsDNA with nine base pairs normally has 18 HBs. As shown in Table 1, the average number
of HBs was 18 ± 0.18 and 17 ± 0.22 for Cd2+ in
the minor and major grooves, respectively, which supported the existence
of binding in major grooves, as the binding destroys the HB in dsDNA.
To further study the denaturation of dsDNA induced by Cd2+, we selected a typical snapshot (Figure 4a). Normally, a Watson–Crick A–T
base pair31 has two HBs, that is, N1···H–N3
and O4···H–N6 (state I, Figure 4b). Remarkably, when the Cd2+ ion
was adsorbed on the thymine, a mismatched A–T base pair occurred.
With the state II shown in Figure 4c, the Cd2+ ion was attracted to the negatively
charged O4 of the thymine because of their electrostatic attraction.
This attraction then induced the formation of a new HB, O2···H–N6,
between the bases and resulted in the destruction of the previous
two HBs. Moreover, we have also calculated the binding energy of a
hydrated Cd2+ ion with the A–T pair by density functional
theory (DFT) based on the following formula 1  where E(A–T) and E(Cd2+(aq)) indicate
the energies of an A–T
pair (state I) and a hydrated Cd2+ ion, respectively. E(A–T–Cd2+(aq)) means the energy
of the state (state II) that the A–T pair binds with the hydrated
Cd2+ ion. The label “aq” denotes the first
water shell of the Cd2+ ion. Details of the applied conformations
are presented in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information. The resulted energy was −15.68 kcal/mol between the Cd2+ ion and the base pair, much larger than the thermal fluctuation
at room temperature (kBT ≈ 0.69 kcal/mol), indicating that the state II is more stable
than the state I, suggesting that the Cd2+ ion can bind
to the A–T pair and then induce deformation of the A–T
pair. Hence, the electrostatic attraction between Cd2+ and
the oxygen in thymine caused the mismatch of the A–T base pair.

mechanism under the Cd2+-induced denaturation
of a dsDNA sequence. (a) Typical conformation of Cd2+ bound
to dsDNA in the major groove from MD simulations. (b) State I: a Watson–Crick
A–T base pair with the designated atoms. The green dotted lines
indicate HBs. (c) State II: a mismatched state of A and T bases caused
by Cd2+ adsorption. The Cd2+ ion is electrostatically
attracted to the negatively charged O4 of thymine (black dotted line).
This attraction induces the formation of a new HB (O2···H–N6)
between the bases and the destruction of previous HBs N1···H–N3
and O4···H–N6.

We also calculated the binding energies of hydrated ions
Zn2+(aq) and Hg2+(aq) to the same DNA sequence
and
compared the results with that of Cd2+(aq) (see the top
of Figure S2). The binding strength of
Cd2+(aq) on DNA reaches 15.68 kcal/mol, and those of Zn2+(aq) and Hg2+(aq) are less than 10 kcal/mol, which
indicate that the effect of the Cd2+ ion on DNA is clearly
larger than those of Zn2+ and Hg2+ ions. These
interesting observations could be potentially attributed to a steric
effect. Namely, the diameter is 1.48 Å for Zn2+, 1.94
Å for Cd2+, and 2.20 Å for Hg2+ (see
the bottom of Figure S2). The matching
degree of Cd2+ and DNA is potentially better than those
of Zn2+ and Cd2+.

It is noteworthy that
the Cd2+-induced mismatched structure
of dsDNA would disturb the normal metabolic activity of the sequence,
such as replication and transcription, causing the denaturation of
dsDNA. Here, we performed simulations with nine base pairs as an example
to show the binding state of Cd2+ and a DNA segment. In
cases when organisms are exposed in the environment polluted by highly
concentrated Cd2+, these toxic ions would inevitably enter
cells/nuclei and further interact with DNA. Hence, DNA segments that
are rich with thymine will increase the probability of binding to
Cd2+, which would eventually cause damage to the organisms.

Conclusions
In summary, using MD simulations, we found that the Cd2+ ions were able to stably bind to one of the oxygen atoms in thymine
of the major groove at room temperature. This binding further destroyed
the natural HBs of the base pair and caused a mismatched structure
of the A–T base pair in dsDNA. Moreover, this Cd-induced structure
did not break the DNA strand. Therefore, this kind of Cd2+-related mismatched structure is easily missed by laboratory experiments.
The findings may contribute an important step toward the understanding
of SNPs caused by cadmium toxicity. Additionally, it may also be helpful
for the facilitation of experimental detection of the ion’s
binding sites.

Methods and Simulations
We placed
the dsDNA segment with Cd2+ immersed in water
modeled with TIP3P32 and added 14 Na+ ions to neutralize the system. All MD simulations were performed
via a Gromacs 4.5.4 instrument.33 The Amber03
force field34 was applied to characterize
the dsDNA and ion sodium. The Lennard-Jones parameters for divalent
cadmium in liquid simulations were from Alexandre,35 with a radius of cross section σ = 2.7 × 10–1 nm and a depth of the potential well ε = 2.5
× 10–2 kJ·mol–1. An
initial periodic box of 5.5 nm × 5.5 nm × 5.5 nm was utilized
for the simulations. In the simulations, each terminal with three
base pairs was fixed to simulate the situation of the DNA segment
wrapped around a nucleosome. The velocity rescaling thermostat was
applied to maintain the temperature at 300 K, and the Parrinello–Rahman36 pressurestat was used to maintain the pressure
at 1 bar. The particle-mesh Ewald method with a real-space cutoff
of 1 nm was used to treat long-range electrostatic interactions, and
a 1 nm smooth cutoff was applied to all van der Waals interactions.
The covalent bonds involving the H atoms were constrained by the LINCS
algorithm. The time step was 1 fs.

To make the system reach
dynamic equilibrium, each system was simulated
with annealing computations from 30 to 300 K by uniform velocity in
the first 4 ns and stable simulation for 10 ns at 300 K under NPT
conditions. For each case in the time interval from 7 to 14 ns, we
selected one conformation per 700 ps to obtain 10 samples as the initial
structures. Then, each sample was taken through a 200 ns NVT ensemble
MD simulation for each groove. Twenty trajectories were obtained to
analyze the binding results of Cd2+ and dsDNA.

An
ab initio method based on the DFT was applied for calculating
the binding energy of the Cd2+ ion with an A–T pair.
The B3LYP exchange–correlation functional37 within the generalized gradient approximation in the framework
of DFT was used in the DFT-based calculations. Three-ζ basis
6-311++G(d,p) was employed with a polarization and diffuse function
added on every atom. All calculations were conducted using the Gaussian
09 package.38
