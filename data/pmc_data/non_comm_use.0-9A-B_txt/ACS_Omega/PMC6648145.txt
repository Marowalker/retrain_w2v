Amplification
of chirality across length scales is a key concept
pertinent to many models aiming to unravel the origin of homochirality.
Tactoids of lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals formed by DNA, dyes,
and other flat ionic molecules in water in the biphasic nematic +
isotropic regime turn out to be a particularly relevant system to
investigate chirality transfer and amplification. Herein, we present
experiments to determine the amplification of chirality by luminescent
gold nanoclusters decorated with adenosine monophosphate inducing
chiral nematic tactoids formed by disodium cromoglycate in water.
Polarized optical microscopy investigations of the induced homochiral
tactoids reveal that adenosine monophosphate shows a higher optical
activity when bound to the surface of such gold nanoclusters in comparison
to free adenosine monophosphate, despite a three-time lower overall
concentration. Free adenosine monophosphate also induces the opposite
chiral twist both in the bulk nematic phase as shown by induced thin
film circular dichroism spectropolarimetry and in the tactoids in
comparison to adenosine monophosphate bound to the gold nanocluster.
Overall, these experiments demonstrate that lyotropic chromonic liquid
crystal tactoids are powerful systems to image and quantify chirality
amplification by key biological chiral molecules that would have played
a role in the origin of homochirality.

1 Introduction
The
scientific community at large is investing a great deal of
effort to rationalize the origin of biological homochirality. The
amplification of chirality on inorganic surfaces, several at the nanoscale,
emerged as one of the potentially more important underlying concepts.1 Homochirality, the single handedness of many
key biological molecules, is ubiquitous in nature and no doubt the
signature of life on our planet. All living organisms use almost exclusively l-amino-acids and d-sugars as building blocks for proteins
and nucleic acids.1,2 Mathematically or more precisely
geometrically speaking, an object is said to be chiral if it cannot
be precisely mapped onto its mirror image by any kind of rotation
or translation (i.e., it is said to be nonsuperimposable).3 Phenomenologically, chirality is observed at
virtually all length scales in nature from massless subatomic particles4 to our hands, plant tendrils,5 and snail shells.6

The
extent or length scale of chiral induction through space (i.e.,
the transmission of chirality from a chiral solute to its surrounding
achiral hosts or environment) is in many cases extremely difficult
or even impossible to measure. By taking advantage of another ubiquitous
phenomenon in nature, the liquid crystalline state, we have a medium
that is highly sensitive to chiral perturbations and permits visualization
as well as quantification of the efficiency of chirality transfer.7 Liquid crystals (LCs) are characterized by the
self-assembly of predominantly anisometric building blocks forming
soft condensed matter. LCs can form a wide variety of architectures
(phases) that can be categorized by the degree of ordering in one-,
two- and three-dimensional space and by the mode of formation, that
is, by varying the temperature (thermotropic LCs) or by changing the
concentration in a fluid/solvent (lyotropic LCs). Nematic LCs (N-LCs),
typically composed of low-molecular weight rod-like organic compounds,
are particularly useful to detect, measure, and visualize chirality
on several levels, from atomic to macromolecular8 to nanoscale particles capped with a chiral ligand shell.9

Experimental data shedding light on the
spatial extent of chiral
induction from a chiral nanoscale surface or nanoparticle are continuing
to deliver astonishing results. Recent experiments from our group
indicate that chiral ligand-capped gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), capped
either with cholesterol10 or with axially
chiral binaphthyl derivatives,11 outperform
their organic molecular counterparts, inducing a tighter helical pitch, p, in the induced chiral nematic LC (N*-LC) phase at a one
order of magnitude lower chiral molecule concentration. In addition,
these chiral ligand-capped AuNPs performed this amazing feat consistently
over larger NP distances, translating into larger chiral correlation
lengths (transmission over larger distances). Such enhancement of
through-space chirality found support from recent examples of demonstrated
long-range through-space interactions between chiral molecules and
plasmonic nanostructures12,13 as well as enhanced
anisotropy (or Kuhn’s dissymmetry) factors, g (g = Δε/ε, where Δε
and ε are the molar circular dichroism (CD) and molar extinction
coefficient, respectively) for chiral molecules in the vicinity of
plasmonic nanostructures.13,14 Further data from our
group provided additional evidence for the hypothesis that desymmetrization
of plasmonic nanostructures, that is, substituting AuNPs for gold
nanorods (AuNRs), results in further through-space chirality enhancement
and tighter p values at even lower overall concentrations
of chiral organic molecules. The investigated cholesterol-capped AuNRs
showed a very distinct aspect ratio-dependent chirality amplification,
prompting their own helical assembly in the induced N*-LC host that
we explained by a chiral feedback loop.15

Most key biological chiral molecules such as amino acids,
sugars,
nucleotides, DNA, and so forth are hydrophilic and dissolve/disperse
well only in water or polar protic solvents. Chirality amplification
of such molecules decorating the surface of metal nanomaterials can
only be studied in aqueous lyotropic not the hydrophobic thermotropic
LC systems (such as, for example, 5CB) used for the cholesterol- and
binaphthyl-based chiral additives.

Well-suited and well-understood
lyotropic LC systems are based
on lyotropic chromonic LCs (LCLCs).16−19 In LCLCs, multiring aromatic
compounds in a certain concentration interval in water self-assemble
into columnar stacks (such as H-aggregates of some dye molecules)
ranging from just a few to several tens or hundreds of molecules in
height.20,21 These stacks are formed by segregation of
polar or ionic groups located at the periphery of the multiaromatic
cores. Most LCLC molecules are dyes, nucleic acids, or drug molecules
such as disodium cromoglycate (DSCG, an asthma and general anti-inflammatory
drug under the trade name Cromolyn, Figure 1a).22

(e, f) Schematics of tactoids formed by DSCG in H2O in
the biphasic N + Iso region: (e) before (racemic) and (f) after addition
of a chiral additive (here, AMP or AMP-AuNCs (homochiral tactoids)).

LCLCs commonly form two LC phases,
the nematic or N-phase and the
columnar M-phase.18 The N-phase is remarkably
sensitive to chiral additives leading to an induced chiral N*-phase
upon addition of enantioenriched amino acids, sugars, or amino acid-capped
(e.g., l-cysteine) AuNPs among others.23 Earlier experimental studies revealed that chirality in
N*-LCLC phases manifests itself in two ways, a twist of molecules
within the stacks16 that can be detected
by induced circular dichroism (ICD) and a twist among stacks that
can be assessed by ICD and visualized by crossed polarized optical
microscopy (POM).23 Our data for l-cysteine-capped AuNPs unambiguously supported chirality amplification
by AuNPs capped with l-cysteine versus l-cysteine
alone. Because consistent characteristic fingerprint textures were
difficult to obtain to measure the helical pitch, p, at lower chiral additive concentration (critical especially for
nanomaterials with a tendency to aggregate in LCLC phases), we used
the molar ellipticity, Θ, measured by ICD spectropolarimetry.
We determined that Θ was about five orders of magnitude more
intense for the l-cysteine-capped AuNPs with an overall l-cysteine concentration of 10–4 wt % in comparison to the sample of DSCG in water doped with 12
wt % neat l-cysteine.24

2 Results and Discussion
To further investigate biologically
significant key chiral molecules
such as adenosine monophosphate, AMP (a nucleotide and a key building
block of universal redox cofactors such as NAD+, NADP+, and FAD,25Figure 1b), and the potential amplification of chirality
after immobilization of such nucleotides on plasmonic nanostructures
(AMP-capped gold nanoclusters, AMP-AuNCs, Figure 1c), we here present a viable alternative
in assessing chirality transfer efficiency and amplification using
the biphasic nematic + isotropic (N + Iso) region formed by DSCG in
water at temperatures above the bulk N-phase first described by Lavrentovich
and co-workers19 and schematically shown
in Figures 1d–f.

Lavrentovich19 and others26,27 established that N-LCLCs in the biphasic N + Iso region form elongated
tactoids. The spatial confinement of the N-phase in its isotropic
environment causes a structural twist even when the material is achiral
or no chiral additive is added. There is simply an equal amount of
tactoids with left- and right-handed structural twist, that is, the
tactoid array is racemic as shown in Figure 1e. However, even small amounts of chiral
guest molecules transform the racemic array into homochiral tactoids
with an exclusively right- or left-handed twist that can be visualized
by POM (Figure 1f).19

To apply this to AMP, either neat or capping
a nanomaterial surface,
we first synthesized AMP-capped AuNCs and characterized both the free
ligand and the purified AuNCs. The synthesis of the Au(I)NCs followed
a procedure reported by Pérez-Prieto28 and all spectroscopic characterization data (UV–vis and photoluminescence
spectra, Figures 2a,b)
were in perfect agreement with those given in ref (28). In addition, we here
provide solution CD spectra for the free ligand and the AuNCs (Figure 2c) as well as thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) data and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images
for the AMP-AuNCs (Figures 2d,e). TGA data were used as an experimental value to support
theoretical calculations of the AuNC ligand weight fraction needed
to later compare the optical activity data (calculated: 34.5 wt %,
TGA: 31.6 wt %) using an established protocol and assuming an approximate
composition of Au∼144L∼5029 and the binding of the AMP moiety via the amino
group and N7 of adenine (see Figure 1b) as described by Pérez-Prieto.28 The solution CD spectra show a negative CD band
for free AMP and positive bands for the AMP-AuNCs (characteristic
set of resolved peaks centered around 300 nm but no plasmonic CD band).
TEM image analysis revealed that the average core diameter, Dcore, of the AMP-AuNCs is about 1.8 ± 0.27
nm with fairly narrow size distribution (Figure 2f).

Figure 2 (a) UV–vis spectrum of AMP (red) and
AMP-AuNCs (green),
inset shows a weak plasmon band at 545 nm for the AuNCs, (b) emission
spectrum of AuNCs in water recorded at λexc = 300
nm (green) and its excitation spectrum (blue) at λem = 477 nm, (c) solution CD spectra in water of AMP (red) and AMP-AuNCs
(green), (d) TGA plot for AMP-AuNCs, (e) TEM image of AuNCs, (f) size
histogram from image analysis, and (g) photograph of AMP-AuNCs in
water (excitation at 366 nm).

Next, we prepared mixtures of AMP and AMP-AuNCs in 15 wt
% DSCG
in water. The concentration of each chiral additive in these mixtures
was adjusted to 0.5, 1, 5, and 7 wt %. In the first set of experiments,
performed at room temperature (20 °C), we studied the induced
N*-LCLC bulk phase, first by POM and then for specific mixtures also
by ICD spectropolarimetry. POM images of the bulk N*-phases (Figure 3) provide several
important information. First, the highly colorful birefringent textures
suggest the presence of the induced N*-phase, and several regions
within each image suggest the formation of fingerprint textures (at
least locally). For the AMP doped mixtures (Figures 3a–d), the mixture with the highest
AMP concentration shows a texture indicative of a columnar or biphasic
N* + M phase,18 which might be aided by
insertion of adenine into the DSCG stacks or intermolecular hydrogen
bonding between adenine moieties coordinated by ionic interactions
to adjacent DSCG stacks (see Figure S1 in Supporting Information); all other POM images for lower AMP concentrations
show textures typical for induced N*-LCLC phases.

Figure 3 Polarized optical photomicrographs
(crossed polarizers) of mixtures
of 15 wt % DSCG in water (a–d) doped with AMP at: (a) 0.5,
(b) 1, (c) 5, (d) 7 wt %, and (e–h) doped with AMP-AuNCs at:
(e) 0.5 wt % in rectangular capillary under an applied magnetic field
of 0.05 T (additional images are provided in Supporting Information, Figure S2), (f) 1, (g) 5, and (h) 7 wt %. Images
(f–h) show mixtures between glass slides treated to induce
planar anchoring (cell gap: 180 μm). Yellow arrows in (f–h)
indicate AuNC aggregation.

POM images for the AMP-AuNC-doped DSCG–water mixtures,
even
after alignment in an external magnetic field and using flat rectangular
capillaries did only produce fingerprint textures in a few areas of
each image, making a direct measurement of the helical pitch of the
induced N*-phase challenging (Figures 3e–h). However, the darker regions in the POM
images for mixtures with AMP-AuNC concentrations ≥1 wt % increasingly
indicated AuNCs aggregation (particulate aggregates highlighted by
yellow arrows in Figures 3f–h) as discussed earlier. Therefore, optical measurements
on the tactoids formed in the N + Iso region and ICD spectropolarimetry
of the N*-LCLC bulk were only performed for the two mixtures of DSCG
in water doped with 0.5 wt % of AMP or AMP-AuNCs. The differences
in AMP concentration in these mixtures are 2.7 × 10–2 mol % for AMP and 9.9 × 10–3 mol % for AMP
capping the AuNCs, on the basis of the calculations referred to above.

The ICD spectra shown in Figure 4 are characterized by broad bands centered around 340
nm that appear to be from two overlapping bands at 310 and 350 nm,
observed in the UV–vis spectrum of the N-phase formed by DSCG
in water24 similar to ICD spectra reported
earlier for induced lyotropic N*-LCLC phases of DSCG in water.24

Figure 4 ICD spectra of DSCG in H2O (15% by weight)
doped with
0.5 wt % of: (a) AMP and (b) AMP-AuNCs. Solid lines are linear dichroism
spectra at the indicated sample rotation angles (in 45° intervals),
dotted lines are the sum ICD spectra.

The sum ICD spectrum for DSCG-water doped with 0.5 wt % AMP
shows
a broad negative band with a maximum sum molar ellipticity value of
ΘAMP = −1.3 × 108 °·cm2·dmol–1 (about three orders of magnitude
lower than the l-cysteine-capped AuNPs reported earlier (Θl-cys = 1.5 × 1011 °·cm2·dmol–1)),24 whereas the mixture doped with 0.5 wt % AMP-AuNCs shows several,
more defined positive bands centered around the same wavelengths (here,
the 310 and 350 nm bands are better resolved with maximum ΘAMP-AuNC = +2.8 × 1014 °·cm2·dmol–1 (also one order of magnitude
lower than Θl-cys-AuNP = +4.5
× 1015 °·cm2·dmol–1)). The difference in sign indicates that AMP and AMP-AuNCs induce
N*-LCLC phases with opposite helical twist (both within and among
the DSCG stacks). The additional band at shorter wavelength (280 nm)
could be related to the AMP-AuNC adenine decorating the helical DSCG
stacks (related to the band in solution CD spectrum of AMP-AuNCs in Figure 1c). Because the exact
contributions to these ICD signals for the AMP-AuNC-doped DSCG–water
mixtures are difficult to ascertain, we then proceeded to study the
biphasic N + Iso region by elevating the temperature during POM investigations
to about 37.5 °C. The formed tactoids were then evaluated as
described by Lavrentovich and co-workers.19

The sign of left- or right-twisted tactoid (twist of the director)
is first established by rotating the analyzer with respect to its
otherwise crossed 90° position with the polarizer by an angle
±γ (extinction angle) to find the two maxima of light transmission
(Figure 5).19 This extinction angle γ for AMP was 103
± 1° (right-twisted tactoids) and the AMP-AuNCs 75 ±
1° (left-twisted tactoids), supporting the opposite sign of the
induced bulk N*-LCLC phase determined by ICD measurements. Plotting
the transmitted intensity of the polarized light as a function of
the extinction angle γ between polarizer and analyzer, and considering
the width of the tactoids (measured by POM) leads to the twist angle
τ (as described in more detail in Experimental
Section). The optical activity η (in °/m ×
wt %) is then calculated by η = |τ|/cd, where c is the concentration and d is the thickness of the tactoids.19

H2O) doped with the two chiral additives at 0.5 wt % each
on cooling from the isotropic liquid phase at 37.5 °C: (a) AMP
causes dark tactoid centers at γ = 103 ± 1°, (b) AMP-AuNCs
cause dark tactoid centers at γ = 75 ± 1°. Data of
transmission vs γ and fits (for details see Experimental Section) for (c) AMP and (d) AMP-AuNCs in DSCG–water
mixtures. A similar set of data using a white light source is given
in Supporting Information (Figure S3).

The values for τ, η,
and the actual concentration of
AMP in both cases (doped either with AMP or with AMP-AuNCs) are given
in Table 1.

Table 1 Twist Angle (τ), Optical Activity
(η), and Overall Concentration of AMP in DSCG–H2O Mixtures (in mol %) Doped with 0.5 wt % of the Chiral Additives

AMP	13 ± 1	1.15 ± 0.09 × 106	2.7 × 10–2	
AMP-AuNC	15 ± 1	1.30 ± 0.09 × 106	9.9 × 10–3	
These values show that a nearly three-time
lower AMP concentration
in the case of the AMP-AuNC-doped sample leads to slightly higher
values in the optical activity. This evidently indicates that the
AuNCs amplify chirality, and therefore, the chirality transfers to
the N-LCLC tactoids formed in the biphasic region of DSCG in water.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated that in addition to other key biological molecules
such as cholesterol and amino acids like l-cysteine, AMP
chirality is amplified after attachment to a plasmonic nanomaterial
surface. We have also shown that straightforward POM techniques can
be used in both thermotropic and lyotropic LC systems to visualize
and quantify chirality amplification. Here, specifically nematic LCLC
tactoids formed in the biphasic N + Iso region of DSCG in water were
imaged and used to calculate and compare the optical activity of neat
AMP and AMP capping the surface of luminescent AuNCs. It appears that
this amplification of chirality through space by chiral molecules
affixed to nanostructures that disperse in the host medium is a universal
phenomenon and that condensed LC phases, thermotropic, lyotropic,
or in the form of tactoids in LCLCs, are a superb medium to visualize
these amplification effects. It seems likely that the amplification
is a result of the chiral molecules acting together, creating significant
local chirality as demonstrated earlier by calculations of a pseudoscalar
chirality index.15 The N*-LCLC tactoids
described here are a particularly sensitive platform to assess chirality
amplification, even for relatively weak chiral inducers such as AMP,
because they are already chiral (yet racemic) before the addition
of the chiral additives. The added chirality simply tips the balance
toward one of the enantiomeric (enantiopure) tactoid forms, leading
to higher optical activity values than those obtained from CD data
in isotropic solutions or those deduced from the helical pitch derived
from fingerprint textures of the bulk N*-LCLC phase.19 Hence, tactoids formed in the biphasic region of chromonic
LCs are the most sensitive choice for detecting chirality amplification,
particularly for weak chiral additives such as AMP (as suggested by
the lower molar ellipticity values from CD experiments in the bulk
N*-LCLC phase) for which the helical twisting power (HTP or βM) cannot be acquired by conventional POM studies (including
Grandjean–Cano wedge cells)30 because
the helical pitch is too large. In each case, free AMP and AMP-AuNCs,
the adenine moiety, which does not participate in the process, either
bound as a bidentate ligand to the AuNC surface or likely inserted
into the DSCG stacks, facilitates interactions between the active
chiral ribose units and the DSCG stacks via a combination of ionic
and hydrogen bonding interactions.

Unfortunately, the inherent
luminescence of DSCG at excitation
wavelengths suitable for excitation of the AuNCs28 prevented further fluorescence confocal microscopy studies
elucidating the spatial distribution of the AMP-AuNCs in the induced
N*-LCLC phase (bulk or tactoids). Future experiments will now focus
on the other four nucleobases and their mono- to triphosphates, particularly
in the light of their remarkable self-assembly including the formation
of LC phases via base pair formation and end-to-end stacking.31−35

Experimental Section
Materials
DSCG, tetrachloroauric(III)
acid (HAuCl4), poly(ethylene glycol) PEG (MW = 3350 g·mol–1), AMP, and the
mild reducing
agent 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazine-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES)36 used for the AMP-AuNC synthesis were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich.

Methods
UV–vis, solution
CD, and induced thin
film CD measurements were performed using an OLIS Cary spectrophotometer
suite (spectrophotometer grade solvents were used). ICD measurements
were performed using an OLIS Cary spectrophotometer. Thin films for
ICD spectropolarimetry were prepared between two quartz substrates
separated by ∼10 μm Kapton tape spacers. Samples were
rotated in 45° intervals from 0 to 315° (in the plane normal
to the incident light beam) to differentiate CD absorption from linear
dichroism and birefringence. TGA was done with TA Instruments TGA
Q500 (New Castle, DE, USA). The heating rate was set at 10 °C·min–1. Photoluminescence spectra were collected using a
Varian Cary Eclipse with variable excitation wavelengths. For sample
preparation, DI water (resistivity 18.2 MΩ, Barnstead Nanopure)
was used. TEM was done using an FEI Tecnai TF30 ST TEM instrument
at an accelerating voltage of 300 kV. Samples were prepared by dip-coating
a carbon-coated copper grid (400 mesh) in an aqueous solution (∼1
mg·mL–1) of the AuNCs. For the investigation
of induced bulk N*-LCLC phase, an Olympus BX-53 polarizing optical
microscope equipped with a Linkam LTS420E heating/cooling stage was
employed. Substrates were either precleaned glass substrates coated
with the polyimide SE-7511L (Nissan Chemical Industries, Ltd) and
rubbed unidirectionally to align the axis of tactoids (cell gap: 180
μm using Mylar spacers) or rectangular capillaries (nominal
gap: 250 μm, Vitrocom, NJ). All mixtures were filled by capillary
force and sealed carefully with epoxy glue to prevent any evaporation.
The mixtures were heated to the isotropic liquid phase, then cooled
down to reach the coexistence N + Iso region, and overtime the tactoids
stabilized (at 37.5 °C). The twist angle of the director in the
middle of tactoids and the azimuthal orientation of tactoid height
were measured by POM (Olympus BX-53 equipped with Linkam LTS420E).
PEG (0.8 wt %, MW = 3,350 g·mol–1) was added to stabilize the tactoids (keeping the
concentration of DSCG in water at 15 wt % and the concentration of
the chiral additives at 0.5 wt % with respect to the total mass of
DSCG and H2O). The cell thickness was adjusted to 180 μm
by Mylar spacer films. The optical transmission was measured with
respect to the extinction angle, γ, between polarizer and analyzer
(between 0 and 180°), which is then fit with
the Mauguin approximation37 because the
twist elastic constant is about one order of magnitude smaller than
those for splay and bend38  where , β
= γ – τ, τ
is the angle of the tactoid director twist, λ = 550 nm is the
wavelength of light, Δn = −0.026 is
the birefringence, and d = 22.5 μm is the height
of the tactoids.39 By measuring the intensity
of the transmitted light (using Ocean Optics USB4000), the twist angle
of the tactoids is obtained.
