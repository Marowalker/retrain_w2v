In
this work, manganese oxide with a 3 × 3 tunnel structure
was synthesized. Mg-todorokite was treated with HNO3 to
obtain H-todorokite, which was used as an electrode for adsorption
of Cs+ from aqueous solution by an electrochemical reaction.
H-todorokite was electrochemically reduced to lower oxidation state
to enhance its negative charge and simultaneously increase the amount
of cations because of the charge compensation. The Cs+ adsorption
on H-todorokite was completed by a coupled electrochemical reaction
(the redox reaction between Mn3+ and Mn4+) and
an ion-exchange reaction between Cs+ and H+ ions.
Cyclic voltammetry measurements at different pHs and Cs+ concentrations were performed. H-todorokite revealed high electrochemical
adsorption capacity for Cs+ because of the high crystallinity
and stability of the materials, which reached 6.0 mmol g–1 in 0.1 mol·L–1 Na2SO4 solution.

1 Introduction
Manganese dioxide (MnO2)-based materials are used widely
as electrochemical supercapacitors because of the redox reaction between
Mn(III) and Mn(IV).1−11 A manganese oxide (MnO2)-based supercapacitor has been
paid great attention because of its large theoretical specific capacitance
of 1300 F·g–1. For example, Mg-doped sodium
birnessite-type MnO2 can be used as an active supercapacitor
electrode material, which exhibits a stable capacitance of 145 F·g–1 over 1100 cycles.8 MnO2 was also used as an effective electrochemical adsorbent for
heavy metal ions because of the charge–discharge reaction during
the electrochemical process. For example, the adsorption capacities
of birnessite for Ni2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, and Cd2+ can be greatly improved by constant-potential
electrolysis compared to isothermal adsorption.12−15 The electrochemical adsorption
capacity of Cd2+ on tunnel-structured manganese oxide cryptomelane
could reach 192 mg·g–1, which was much higher
than the initial 12 mg·g–1 adsorption capacity
in conventional adsorption.13 This result
indicated that the redox process made great contributions to adsorption
of ions by manganese oxides. For the adsorption of Cs+,
especially 137Cs+ from nuclear waste, different
materials, such as Prussian Blue16−18 and its analogues,19 clays,20−22 and zeolites,23 have been used. In 1984, MnO2 was used for adsorption
of microamounts of radiotracer 137Cs using a radiotracer
technique by Hasany and Chaudhary.24 However,
the removal of the adsorbed Cs+ on MnO2 is very
difficult. Manganese octahedral molecular sieves with porous structure
and one-dimensional tunnel structure have been found to be favorable
in cation adsorption. Synthetic todorokite-type MnO2 with
one-dimensional (3 × 3) tunnel structure was used for metal ion
extraction–insertion reactions in the aqueous phase by Feng
and co-worker.25 Cs+ adsorption
using synthetic todorokite-type MnO2 by Sonoda26 showed that todorokite (Mg–H) and todorokite
(Ca–H) can almost completely adsorb Cs+ (ca. 100%)
from drinking water intentionally contaminated with 0.1 mmol·dm3 of CsCl with an adsorptive capacity of 0.50 mmol·g–1. The radiocesium retention onto birnessite and todorokite
by Yu and co-workers27 indicates that the
structural factors of Mn oxides significantly affect the retention
capacity of radioactive Cs+. However, the traditional adsorption
by manganese oxides was completed by the ion exchange between the
balanced cations and Cs+. Thus, the lower adsorption capacity
and full desorption are still difficult for these absorbents. Todorokite,
the tunnel-structured manganese oxide with a 6.9 Å × 6.9
Å tunnel, was thought to be an adsorbent26,28 with suitable pore size for Cs+. Thus, in this work,
Mg-todorokite was synthesized, and acid treatment-type H-todorokite
was used for the electrochemical adsorption of Cs+. The
micromorphology, structure, and chemical composition before and after
electrochemical adsorption were characterized by X-ray diffraction
(XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS).

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 XRD, SEM, and Energy-Dispersive X-ray Characterization
of the Samples
Mg-Tod, H-Tod, and H-Tod after electrochemical
reduction [labeled H-Tod(Re)] and after adsorption of Cs+ (Cs-Tod) are first examined by XRD and field-emission SEM equipped
with an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) accessory.

The XRD patterns
of the samples are plotted in Figures 1 and S1. The XRD patterns
of H-Tod(Re) and Cs-Tod show the characteristic diffraction peaks
of Tod together with the peak from carbon cloth. This explains that
the structure of Tod is still stable after the electrochemical process
and adsorption. The EDX results (Figure S2) show a Mg/Mn ratio of 0.15 in Mg-Tod and 0.06 in H-Tod, which suggests
that only 60% of Mg2+ are extracted from Mg-Tod by the
acid treatment. It indicates that Mg2+ exists both in the
framework and tunnels of Mg-Tod.29 The
decreased amount of Mg2+ is replaced by H+,
which can be ion-exchanged by Cs+.

Figure 1 XRD patterns (A) and
SEM images (B) of the samples.

SEM images show that Mg-Tod and H-Tod possess aggregated rodlike
morphology (Figure 1). The morphology of H-Tod(Re) and Cs-Tod has almost not changed.
The adsorption of Cs+ into H-Tod was characterized by EDX
elemental analysis (Figure S2). A Cs/Mn
ratio of 0.015 for Cs-Tod is achieved because of the charge compensation,
as for other MnO2 electrodes.6

Thermogravimetric analyses were performed on a thermogravimetric
analyzer under nitrogen atmosphere in a temperature range of 30–700
°C at a heating rate of 5 °C·min–1. The thermogravimetry curves of Mg-Tod and H-Tod are shown in Figure 2A. The weight loss
from 30 to 200 °C is caused by the loss of physically adsorbed
water and crystal lattice water. The weight loss between 200 and 600
°C corresponds to the transformation of Mn(IV) to Mn(III) with
the release of oxygen. The residue at 700 °C is confirmed by
XRD (Figure 2B). For
H-Tod, the residue is Mn3O4. However, in the
final products of Mg-Tod, there is Mn3O4 and
manganese magnesium oxide (MgO)x(MnO)y because of the higher Mg content in Mg-Tod.

Figure 2 Thermogravimetry
curves of the samples (A) and XRD patterns of
the residue (B).

The surface chemical
state and electronic structure of samples
were determined by XPS. The survey XPS results of the samples are
depicted in Figure S3. Mn, O, C, and Mg
signals were observed for all the samples. For Cs-Tod, a Cs 3d signal
can be observed, indicating that Cs+ is absorbed by the
material (Figure S4). The Mn 2p, Mn 3s,
and O 1s spectra often can be used to obtain the information related
to the different oxidation states of Mn. The Mn 2p spectrum appears
at binding energies of about 642 eV (Mn 2p3/2) and 653
eV (2p1/2) (Figure S5). Usually,
the position of Mn 2p peaks does not use to evaluate the oxidation
state of Mn because the position of the peaks does not change sensitively
with the oxidation state of Mn.30−32 However, the identification of
Mn3+ and Mn4+ can be achieved by the Mn 2p spectrum.
Further analysis usually assigns the peaks around 643.5 and 654.8
eV as the Mn4+ species and the peaks around 642 and 653
eV as the Mn3+ species.32−35

The Mn 3s and O 1s (Figure 3) regions can give
further information about the chemical
state of Mn. The Mn 3s spectrum splits into two peaks, and the value
of ΔE3s can be used to calculate
the average oxidation state (AOS) of Mn.31,36 According to the equation VMn = 8.95–1.13
ΔE3s32,33 the AOS in
Tod can be obtained as listed in Table 1. Based on the calculated ΔE3s energy difference (4.62–4.72 eV), the AOS of
Mn is around 3.62–3.73, which indicates that the sample contains
mainly Mn4+ with some Mn3+ contribution.

1s XPS spectra.

The O 1s spectra usually reflect
the types of surface oxygen in
the materials. Based on the peak positions, three types of oxygen
species can be identified. The low binding energy peak observed at
530 eV is often thought of lattice O because all manganese atoms are
bonded to an oxygen atom, corresponding to MnOOH and MnO2 species. The peak at about 531 eV is assigned to the surface-adsorbed
O, OH groups, and O vacancies. The high binding energy peak around
533 eV is usually identified as adsorbed water. Taking into account
the area of the Mn–O–Mn and Mn–O–H contribution
in the O 1s spectrum,6,37 the AOS of Mn can also be calculated
according to the following equation 1  

The results are listed in Table 1. We can see that
acid treatment of Mg-Tod to H-Tod
causes a slight increase in the AOS of Mn, owing to the Mn(III) disproportional
reaction to Mn(IV) and Mn(II) in the acid solution.25,28,39,40 The electrochemical
reduction form H-Tod(Re) shows a slight decrease of Mn AOS, which
indicates the reduction of Mn4+ to Mn3+. An
increase of Mn AOS in Cs-Tod suggests that Cs+ intercalates
into the tunnel of MnO2. The process of the ion-exchange
reaction is similar to the H+ exchange from Mg-Tod to H-Tod,
together with the disproportion of Mn(III) in the solution.

2.2 Electrochemical Adsorption of Cs+ by H-Tod(Re)
The electrochemical behavior of H-Tod electrode
was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique in a N2-saturated 0.1 mol·L–1 Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte between −0.3 and 1.35 V versus
a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) (Figures 4A and S6). One
cathodic peak (from 0.5 to 0.7 V), one anodic peak (from 0.8 to 1.1
V), and one unobvious cathodic peak around 0.15 V can be found. The
shape of cyclic voltammograms for H-Tod is different from the nearly
symmetrical rectangular shape for carbon materials,41 which is characteristic of the electrochemical double-layer
capacitive behavior. For MnO2-based materials, the energy
stored in the capacitors is either capacitive (non-Faradaic process)
or pseudocapacitive (Faradaic process). Based on the different process,
the charge separation can take place at the electrode/electrolyte
interface, or the redox reactions can occur in the electrode materials.
The cyclic voltammograms in this work show both the rectangular shape
and redox peak, which indicate the Faradaic reaction occurring both
on the surface and in the bulk of the electrodes. The Faradaic process
on the surface causes the surface adsorption of cations on MnO2 from the electrolyte, while the Faradaic reaction corresponding
to the redox peak can be ascribed to the intercalation/deintercalation
of cation between the electrode and the electrolyte accompanied by
the electrochemical conversion between Mn(III) and Mn(VI). Also, the
presence of the redox peak may be due to the higher degree of crystallization
of the sample used in our experiments.8,42 The effect
of scan rate on H-Tod in 0.1 mol L–1 Na2SO4 indicates that the cation and anodic peak all shift
with different scan rates. It may further have an influence on the
electrochemical intercalation/deintercalation of cation.1,42 The CV curves of H-Tod electrode during 1–1000 cycles (Figure 4B) still show clearly
the peaks during reduction and oxidation. The slight shift of the
peaks does not transform the H-Tod structure, which can be seen from
the XRD pattern after 1000 cycles (Figure S7).

Figure 4 CV curves for H-Tod in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution
at different scan rates (A), different scan cycles at a scan rate
of 0.1 V s–1 (B), different pHs at a scan rate of
0.1 V s–1 (C), and different amounts of Cs+ at a scan rate of 0.1 V s–1 (D).

H-Tod is used for the adsorption of Cs+ in our
experiments
because of the good performance on ion intercalation, as can be seen
from CV curves when used as an electrode. The mechanism of the intercalation
of Cs+ is due to the reduction of Mn(IV) to Mn(III)43 and the ionic exchange of Cs+ for
charge compensation as described for other MnO2-based materials.7,9,11  

Because the reduction
of Mn(IV) to Mn(III) is beneficial for the
ion storage because of the charge compensation, the electrode with
H-Tod was subjected to 5 min of electrochemical reduction at −0.3
V potential [labeled H-Tod (Re)] for Cs+ adsorption in
the following experiment. To test the electrochemical stability of
H-Tod, the reduction process is processed at −0.3 V potential
for 12 h (Figure S8). In the whole process,
the current change is very small, confirming their high activity and
long-term stability. The sample after 12 h reduction tests is determined
by XRD (Figure S9), which shows the characteristic
peak of Tod. This is further evidence for the high stability of H-Tod
used in the experiment.

The effect of pH on the electrochemical
behavior is investigated
by adjusting the pH of the electrolyte solution using H2SO4 or NaOH. The cyclic voltammograms are plotted in Figure 4C. It can be seen
that in strong acid medium, the redox peaks on the CV curves are strong
with the reduction potential shifting to a positive direction. This
suggests that MnO2 is more easily reduced to a lower state
according to Nernst equation. By increasing the pH, the typical shoulder
peak can be observed. However, in strong basic medium (pH = 11 and
13), the cyclic voltammograms only show a rectangular shape, which
implies that strong basic environment is not favorable for the intercalation/deintercalation
of the cations from the electrolyte. That is, the charge storage mechanism
varies with pH. Although the shape of cyclic voltammograms change
at different pHs, the electrode is stable both in strong acid and
basic medium. The XRD of the electrode after electrochemical at different
pHs has no change in the process (Figure S10), indicating the stability of H-Tod with pH. Therefore, the material
in this work can be used in a broad pH range of aqueous solution.

The CV curves of H-Tod(Re) with different amounts of Cs+ are plotted in Figure 4D. It can be seen that the potential separation between the two obvious
peaks is lessened with the increase of Cs+ concentration,
which favors the electrochemical intercalation/deintercalation of
cations.42

The adsorption capacity
of Cs+ is obtained by soaking
H-Tod(Re) in the solution containing different Cs+ concentrations
for 20 min. After that, the Cs+ in the solution is calculated
by the difference before and after adsorption. The concentrations
of Mg2+, Mn2+, and Cs+ were measured
by HITACHI ZA3000 atomic absorption spectroscopy. With increasing
Cs+ concentration in the Na2SO4 electrolyte,
the adsorption capacity H-Tod(Re) first increases and then remains
nearly constant (Figure 5A). The adsorption capacity of H-Tod(Re) with support of 0.002 g
on the electrode is about 6.0 mmol·g–1. The
XRD pattern of the sample after adsorption (Figure S11) shows nearly no change. The adsorption capacity of H-Tod(Re)
with 1 g·L–1 of Cs+ in the Na2SO4 electrolyte at different pHs is plotted in Figure 5B. The adsorption
capacity curve first decreases slightly and then increases slightly
by increasing the solution pH. In acidic medium, H+ competes
with Cs+ in the tunnel of H-Tod. However, with more OH– in the solution, it consumes H+ and thus
facilitates the insertion of Cs+. Strong acid may promote
the disproportionation of Mn(III) and contributes to the slight increase
of the adsorption.

Figure 5 Cs+ adsorption capacities of the H-Tod (Re)
electrodes
(A) with different concentrations of Cs+ in the electrolyte
and (B) at different pHs.

The content of Mg2+ and Mn2+ released during
Cs+ adsorption is shown in Figure S12. It can be seen that the concentration of Mg2+ and Mn2+ is almost constant by increasing the Cs+ content
in the electrolyte. That is, Mg2+ and Mn2+ (come
from the disproportionation reaction of Mn3+) are released
from the framework of H-Tod, which contributes to the insertion of
Cs+ into the tunnel of the structure. However, long-time
reduction will not be favorable for stabilizing the structure of H-Tod
because of the disproportionation property of Mn(III). Therefore,
the electrode should be regenerated after adsorption, which can be
achieved from the electrochemical oxidation process.

However,
when we conduct the isothermal adsorption, until about
48 h, the adsorption equilibrium can be achieved. The adsorption capacity
is only about 2.1 mmol·g–1 (Figure S13), which is similar to the maximum value by todorokite
in ref (27). The result
shows that the adsorption capacity of H-Tod for Cs+ increased
from 2.1 to 6.0 mmol g–1 after electrochemical reduction
process. That is, the electrochemical reaction contributes a lot to
the adsorption capacity. Therefore, the electrochemical process is
effective for Cs+ adsorption from aqueous solution.

3 Conclusions
The Cs+ adsorption capacity
can be greatly improved
using H-Tod in 0.l mol·L–1 Na2SO4 solutions based on an electrochemical reduction method. When
the electrochemical adsorption is completed at a potential of −0.3
V, the adsorption capacity of H-Tod(Re) for Cs+ after electrochemical
process can reach 6.0 mmol·g–1, which is much
larger than 2.1 mmol·g–1 isothermal adsorption
with H-Tod. The reduction from Mn(IV) and Mn(III) in the structure
contributes to the high adsorption capacity of Cs+, which
is caused by the decrease of Mn AOS. H-Tod with higher thermal stability
and suitable tunnel size contributes to the efficiency of Cs+ adsorption. With obvious advantages of high adsorption capacity,
thermal and chemical stability, electrochemical adsorption of Cs+ by H-Tod thus holds great promise for practical application
in enrichment and separation of Cs+ in aqueous solution.

4 Experimental Details
4.1 Sample Preparation
Mg-todorokite
(Mg-Tod) was synthesized by mixing 0.2 g of Mg-buserite (wet solid)
and 10 mL of deionized water at 160 °C for 2 days.25 Protonated todorokite (H-Tod) was formed by
treating 1.0 g of Mg-Tod with 100 mL of 1 mol·L–1 HNO3 solutions for 2 days at room temperature.

4.2 Electrochemical Adsorption of Cs+
The electrochemical
adsorption of Cs+ was conducted
using a three-electrode system. The H-Tod (75 wt %), acetylene black
(15 wt %), and polyvinylidene fluoride (10 wt %) were added into 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone.
The mixture was ultrasonically dispersed to be used as an adsorbent
on the working electrode. The electrochemical adsorption was processed
by a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation. The potentials were referred
to the SCE. Carbon fabric (1.5 × 2.5 cm2) with a 100
μL mixture (H-Tod 0.002 g) was used as the working electrode.
SCE and carbon electrode were used as the reference and counter electrodes,
respectively. Na2SO4 solution (50 mL 0.1 mol
L–1) was used as the electrolyte. Cs2SO4 solid was added into the Na2SO4 solution to prepare the Cs+-containing solutions. The
Cs+ concentration varied from 0.2 to 1.8 g·L–1. The adsorption capacity at different pHs was conducted in the above
solutions under controlled pH. All the experiment was completed at
room temperature. The isothermal adsorption of Cs+ by H-Tod
was conducted at constant pH 7.0. The adsorption process and capacity
were compared with those of electrochemical adsorption.

The
Cs+ adsorption capacity of H-Tod was calculated according
to the following equation 2  

Qs (mol·g–1)
was the Cs+ adsorption capacity, c0 (mol·L–1) was the initial concentration
of Cs+ in the reaction system, cs (mol·L–1) was the concentration of Cs+ in the solution after adsorption, Vs (L) was the volume of solution, and m (g)
was the mass of manganese oxides on the electrode (or the materials
used in the isothermal adsorption).
