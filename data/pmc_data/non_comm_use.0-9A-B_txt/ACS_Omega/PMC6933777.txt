Oxacillinases (OXAs) β-lactamases are of special
interest
because of their capacity to hydrolyze antibacterial drugs such as
cephalosporins and carbapenems, which are frequently used as the last
option for the treatment of multidrug-resistant bacteria. Although
the comprehension of the involved mechanisms at the atomic level is
crucial for the rational design of new inhibitors and antibiotics,
currently there is no study on the acylation/deacylation mechanisms
of the OXA-24/avibactam complex from first principles; therefore,
mechanistic details such as activation barriers, characterization
of intermediates, and transition states are still uncertain. In this
article, we address the deacylation of the OXA-24/avibactam complex
by molecular dynamics simulations and hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular
mechanics computations. The study supplies mechanistic details not
available so far, namely, topology of the potential energy surfaces,
characterization of transition states and intermediates, and calculation
of the respective activation barriers. The results show that the deacylation
occurs via a mechanism of two stages; the first one involves the formation
of a dianionic intermediate with a computed activation barrier of
24 kcal/mol. The second stage corresponds to the cleavage of the OS81–C bond promoted by the protonation of the OS81 atom by the carboxylated Lys84 and the concomitant formation
of the C7–N6 bond, allowing the liberation
of avibactam and recovery of the enzyme. The calculated activation
barrier for the second stage is 13 kcal/mol. The structure of the
intermediate, formed in the first stage, does not fulfill the characteristics
of a tetrahedral intermediate. These results suggest that the recyclization
of avibactam from the OXA-24/avibactam complex may occur without the
emergence of tetrahedral intermediates, unlike that observed in the
class A CTX-M-15.

Introduction
Gram-negative bacteria have built-in capabilities
to find new manners
to be resistant and can pass along genetic materials that permit other
bacteria to become drug resistant as well. This resistance is facilitated
by the production of enzymes, known as β-lactamases, which make
the antibiotic inactive by hydrolyzing the amide bond of the β-lactam
ring. According to the literature, β-lactamases share a common
characteristic in their catalytic mechanism consisting of the emergence
of one or two tetrahedral intermediates along the reaction pathway.1−3

β-Lactamases are cataloged in serine β-lactamases,
SBLs, in which a serine residue plays the role of a nucleophile to
attack the carbonyl carbon of the β-lactam ring; and in the
zinc metallo-enzymes, MBLs, in which a zinc ion catalyzes the hydrolysis
of a wide variety of β-lactam antibiotics. The SBLs are classified
according to their amino acid sequence in three groups, class A, class
C, and class D, whereas the MBLs are categorized together into the
class B. Because of their preference for isoxazolyl-type penicillins,
like oxacillin, the class D enzymes are known as oxacillinases, or
simply OXAs. Nowadays, more than 250 class D β-lactamases have
been identified and are classified into three subfamilies according
to the following: (a) narrow-spectrum enzymes exhibit a preference
for penicillins; (b) extended-spectrum β-lactamases are those
having the capability to hydrolyze advanced-generation cephalosporins,
besides penicillins; and (c) carbapenem-hydrolizing class D β-lactamases
such as OXA-23, OXA-24, and OXA-48.4−7 Unlike class A and class C β-lactamases,
the structure of class D β-lactamases lacks an omega loop Glu166,
and in its place involves a fully carboxylated lysine under biological
conditions. Presumably because of the hydrophobic character of the
active site that decreases the pKa of
Lys84, permitting in this way the deprotonation that is required for
the attack of CO2. Thus, at physiological conditions, it
should be completely carboxylated, although the crystallization pH
may influence the grade of carboxylation.3,8

One effective stratagem to fight the resistance is to supply an
antibacterial drug along with a β-lactamase inhibitor. Thus,
in the late seventies and early eighties of the last century, three
β-lactam-inhibitors were incorporated into clinical use: tazobactam,
sulbactam, and clavulanic acid, all of them comprise a β-lactam
core. These inhibitors are known as suicide inactivators through the
formation of a stable acyl-enzyme intermediate with the catalytic
serine, producing near permanently inactivated species.9 On the other hand, avibactam,10 a diazobicyclo
heterocyclic inhibitor that reversibly acylates serine beta lactamases,
shows exceptional inhibitory activity against both class A and class
C enzymes and variable levels of inhibition against class D enzymes.
Although the comprehension of the involved mechanisms at the atomic
level is fundamental for the rational design of new inhibitors and
antibiotics, currently there is no study on the deacylation mechanism
of the OXA-24/avibactam complex from first principles, therefore the
mechanistic details are a matter of controversy.

In this article,
we address the deacylation of the OXA-24/Avibactam
complex by means of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations along with
hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations. The results
suggest that the deacylation of the OXA-24/avibactam complex occurs
via a two stage-mechanism. The first one, comprises the abstraction
of the proton from the atom N6 by Lys218, through Ser128,
entailing the formation of a dianionic intermediate in the first stage;
whereas the second stage involves the nucleophilic attack of the N6 atom on the C7 carbonyl atom, causing the break
of the OS81–C7 bond and the release of
avibactam and the recovery of the enzyme. On the other hand, the results
also show that the deacylation of the OXA-24/avibactam complex occurs
without the emergence of any tetrahedral intermediate.

Results and Discussion
The results of the 100 ns MD
simulations are shown in Figure 1. The obtained plots
of root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) for the active site and the root-mean-square
fluctuation (RMSF) show a very stable behavior along the simulation.
The interactions among the avibactam and the active-site residues
are described as follows. The most important observed interaction
is between Arg261 and the sulfate group of avibactam, Figure 2a, whose calculated MD interactions
energy is about −75 (kcal/mol) on average.

active site. (b) RMSF plot showing the key
residues denoted in blue lines.

Figure 2 (a) Interaction between the sulfate group of avibactam
and Arg261.
(b) Distribution of the angle Ser128(O–H–N)Lys218 (b).

This interaction keeps the aminosulfate moiety
of avibactam firmly
inside the active site, and in this way hinders its rotational freedom.
The other important residue is Ser128, which interacts with both avibactam
and Lys218 because of the different possible orientations of the hydroxyl
group, Figure 2b. Thus,
the angle Ser128(O–H)–(N)Lys218 may take two possible
orientations, that with values below 130° and that with values
greater than this value. In the first case, the hydroxyl group is
oriented toward the sulfate group, whereas in the second case, the
hydroxyl proton points to the nitrogen atom of Lys218, forming an
adequate angle for the proton transfer. In addition, Ser128 interacts
through the hydroxyl oxygen with the proton of the aminosulfate nitrogen
N6 by means of hydrogen bonding.

As it was mentioned
above, the proton of the aminosulfate nitrogen
N6 may interact with the hydroxyl oxygen of Ser128. During
the dynamics, the angle of the N6–H bond fluctuates
among different possible directions as shown in Figure 3. For values less than 100°, the proton
points to outside of the active site; whereas for values greater than
100°, the proton points to inside the active site. In the first
case, the orientation does not lead to any reaction, whereas in the
second case, the orientation allows the hydrogen bonding interaction
with the hydroxyl oxygen of Ser128, favoring in this way the deprotonation
of the N6 atom via the proton shuttle toward Lys218 via
Ser128.

simulation.

In the present study, a cluster analysis was carried
out in terms
of the dihedral angles α, β, γ, defined as follows:
α = C8–C5–N6–HA, β = C4–C5–N6–HA, and γ = C5–N6–O–S; the first two dihedrals account for the
orientation of the proton attached to the N6 atom, whereas
the last one accounts for the orientation of the sulfate moiety. In
cluster analysis, data is ordered into descriptive groups based upon
comparable features. The elements of each group have more in common
among them than with those of other groups. The component most typical
of each group is known as the centroid of the cluster.

The results
of the cluster analysis are shown in Figure 4; the red dot shows the centroid
of the cluster. This centroid corresponds to the structure at 76 ns
of the simulation. A reduced representation of the centroid is depicted
in Figure 5. On account
of the positions of Ser128, Ser81, Lys218, Lys84, and Arg261, along
with the protonation state of Lys 218, according to Propka3; we postulate
that the deacylation mechanism may be described by two potential energy
surfaces, Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Overall Mechanism for the Recyclization of Avibactam
from Its Complex
with OXA-24
The first one, PES-1, should account for the
abstraction of the
proton, from the N6 atom, by Lys218 through Ser128 to form
an intermediate, which in turn should lead to the liberation of the
enzyme and recyclization of avibactam by the break of the Ser81–C7 bond, PES-2.

For the exploration of PES-1, the following
reaction coordinates
were used, R1 defined as the distance
between the hydroxyl proton of Ser128 and the nitrogen atom of Lys218
and the second reaction coordinate R2 is
defined by the distance between N6 and C7 atoms.
While for the PES-2, the reaction coordinates are defined as follows:
the distance between atoms N6 and C7 defines
the reaction coordinate, R3; and the distance
between the proton of the N-carboxylated lysine and the oxygen of
Ser81 defines the reaction coordinates, R4.

The so-obtained PES-1 is shown in Figure 6a. The representative structure, taken from
the cluster analysis, lies in the upper right corner of the surface.
From this point, the topology of PES-1 suggests a reaction pathway
in which both coordinates vary in a nearly symmetrical way until the
complex R is formed at coordinates R1 ≈
2.1 Å and R2 ≈ 2.8 Å.
From this point the reaction pathway shows the inversion of the pyramidal
structure of the N6 atom to position its electron-lone
pair pointing to the C7 carbonyl carbon, along with the
rotation of the amino group of Lys218 to dispose the electron pair
pointing to the hydroxyl proton of Ser128. As result of the above
steps, the Michaelis Complex, MC-1 is formed at coordinates R1 ≈ 2.1 Å and R2 ≈ 2.0 Å.

intermediate, MC-2: Michaelis
complex, TS-2: transition-state 2, P: products). (b) Optimized Structure
of the transition state TS-1, distance in Å. (c) Optimized structure
of the dianionic intermediate, INT, angles in degrees.

From the MC-1, the reaction follows with the deprotonation
of the
N6 atom by Lys218, through Ser128, to reach a dianionic
intermediate, INT, via the formation of the transition state, TS-1.
The reaction path shows an activation energy of 24.0 kcal/mol corresponding
to the saddle point located at R1 ≈
1.5 Å, and R2 ≈ 2.1 Å.
The structure of the respective transition state is shown in Figure 6b. It is possible
to observe an optimum alignment among N6–H, Ser128,
and Lys218, allowing in this way the proton transfer from the N6 atom to Lys218 through Ser128. On the other hand, the distances
and bond lengths of the participating species are evidence that the
proton transfer is in course.

To characterize TS-1, and in order
to save computational time,
we considered a clusterized model including only the species of the
QM region, namely, avibactam, Ser81, Lys84, Ser128, Lys218, and Arg261.
In addition, Ser128 was replaced by methanol, the Lys218 was replaced
by methylamine, and Arg261 was replaced by N-methylguanidinium.
The use of clusterized models including the residues involved directly
in the catalytic task has been reported to be adequate to describe
electronic structures and related energetic profiles.11

The transition state was characterized by frequency
calculations,
at the M06-2X/6-31+G* level of theory. The results show one imaginary
frequency (ν = 1541.0 cm–1, intensity = 4110),
in addition to some spurious frequencies because of the absence of
the proteic environment in the clusterized model. The observed imaginary
frequency corresponds to the (Ser128)–O–H and N6–HA bond stretching, accounting for the
protonation of Lys218 and the abstraction of the N6 proton
by Ser128. An animation of the associated imaginary frequency is shown
in Movie S1 in the Supporting Information.
The results of the natural bond orbital, NBO, calculations, for the
same model, are summarized in Table 1.

OS128–HS128	0.63	0.29	0.06	
HS128–NK218	0.05	0.41	0.59	
It is observed that the NBO charges of key atoms (N6, C7, OS128, NK218) vary
according
to the progress of the reaction; thus, the atomic partial charges
on the key N6 and C7 atoms take extreme values
in the intermediate INT, as expected for the formation of the dianionic
intermediate. On the other hand, the charges on the NK218 and the OA atoms follow the same tendency, making evident
the following stage of the mechanism. Meanwhile, the Wiberg bond indexes
vary accordingly; that is, the decrease in bond indexes of the bonds
subject to cleavage, and the strength of those bonds being formed.
It is especially remarkable that the index of the C7–OA bond remains practically unchanged during the reaction, reaching
the value of 1.64 in the intermediate, 1.60 in the transition state
TS-1, and 1.58 in the Michaelis complex, MC-1. Correspondingly, the
bond length of the C7–OA keeps constant
at 1.25 Å, and the NBO charge on the carbonyl oxygen changes
slightly from −0.73 to −0.68 when going from the Michaelis
complex, MC-1 to the intermediate, INT.

Once the transition
state TS-1 is formed, the reaction continues
with the formation of the intermediate INT, at coordinates R1 ≈ 1.0 Å and R2 ≈ 2.5 Å, Figure 6c. This intermediate is characterized with
real frequencies, with the exception of some spurious frequencies
arising because of the clusterized model. The bond angles of the C7 carbonyl atom are 128.7, 113.8, and 115.5°, whereas
the C7–OA bond length is 1.25 Å.
The bond orders obtained by NBO calculations are: C7–OA: 1.64, C7–N6: 0.08. All of the
above values do not meet the expected values corresponding to sp3 hybridization, but to an sp2 carbon. In consequence,
it is possible to conclude that the hybridization of the C7 carbonyl carbon does not change along the reaction path and keeps
as sp2 all of the way.

On the other hand, if a tetrahedral
intermediate were formed in
this stage, it would be observed at coordinates R1 ≈ 1.1 Å and R2 ≈ 1.5 Å, on the PES-1. However, no local minimum is
observed at this point; moreover, the energy at these coordinates
is 32.0 kcal/mol higher than the dianionic intermediate. These results
suggest the nonoccurrence of a tetrahedral intermediate in the deacylation
of the OXA-24/avibactam complex. Moreover, the ambient around the
carbonyl carbon in class D enzymes is more hydrophobic than those
found in class A and class C β-lactamases. In OXA-24, the more
hydrophobic nature of the binding pocket results in fewer polar interactions
with avibactam when compared to other β-lactamases.8 A schematic representation of the interactions
between avibactam and the protein for the 100 ns MD simulation, are
shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Avibactam-residue
interactions for the 100 ns MD simulation (light
green: hydrophobic, light blue: polar).

The hydrophobic barrier formed by Tyr112, Trp115,
Trp221, Trp167,
Ala126, Ala80, and Leu127 is clearly observed; accordingly, there
is no water molecules interacting with the OA atom of the
carbonyl group of avibactam. This finding is in agreement with that
reported in the literature9,12 for OXAS. Under these
conditions, the formation of a potential oxyanion, such as that required
for the formation of tetrahedral intermediates, would be highly hindered.

The intermediate INT so formed is located in the upper right corner
of PES-2, Figure 8a.
From here, the reaction continues fundamentally with a conformational
rearrangement, that is, the approaching of the carboxylic proton of
Lys84 toward the oxygen Os of Ser81, to reach the prereactive
complex MC-2, located at coordinates of about (R3∼2.0 and R4∼1.8)
in the PES-2.

Figure 8 (a): Two-dimensional view of PES-2. (INT: intermediate,
MC-2: Michaelis
Complex, TS-2: transition state 2, P: products). (b): Optimized structure
of the transition state TS-2, distance in Å.

From MC-2, the reaction continues with the nucleophilic
attack
of the N6 atom on the C7 carbonyl carbon, along
with the concomitant protonation of the OS81 atom by the
carboxylated Lys84, reaching a saddle point at coordinates R3 ≈ 1.6 Å and R4 ≈ 1.4 Å, corresponding to the transition
state, TS-2. The calculated activation barrier for this stage is about
13.0 kcal/mol. The structure corresponding to the saddle point, TS-2,
is shown in Figure 8b. This transition state was characterized using a clusterized model,
involving Lys218, Ser128, Lys84, Arg261, Ser81, and avibactam. The
frequency calculations, at M06-2x/6-31+G* level of theory show one
imaginary frequency (ν = 1138.7 cm–1, intensity
= 4485) corresponding to the OK84–HK84 and OS81–C7 bond stretching. An animation
of the imaginary frequency is shown in Movie S2 of the Supporting Information.

The transition states, TS-1
and TS-2, were also characterized by
NBO calculations. The obtained Wiberg bond index between key atoms
are shown in Table 2. From this table, decreases in the values of the bond indexes for
the bonds subject to cleavage were observed, whereas increases in
the index values for the bonds being formed are observed. Thus, the
value of the bond index for the C7–N6 bond changes from 0.08 to 0.77, when going from the intermediate
INT to TS-2. These values account for the nucleophilic attack of the
N6 atom on the C7 carbon, entailing the recyclization
of avibactam. On the other hand, the bond index for the OS81–HK84 bond changes from 0.00 to 0.26, for INT and
TS-2, respectively; on the other hand, for the C7–OS81 bond the value goes from 0.93 to 0.66, for the intermediate
and TS-2, respectively. These bond index values are indicative that
two events are occurring simultaneously, namely the protonation of
the OS81 by Lys84 and the cleavage of the C7–OS81.

OK84–HK84	0.69	0.42	
The rate-determining step results to be the first
one, corresponding
to the formation of the dianionic intermediate INT. This reaction
path involves the protonation of Lys218 by Ser128, and the concomitant
deprotonation of the aminosulfate nitrogen N6 atom by Ser128, Movie S3 of the Supporting Information. The calculated
activation barrier of 24.0 kcal/mol is in good agreement with the
value of 25.5 kcal/mol, calculated by the Eyring equation from the
experimental value of 6.3 × 10–6 (s–1) for the deacylation rate constant.8 The
second stage of the mechanism corresponds to the liberation of the
product, that is, the recyclization of avibactam and its release from
the proteic environment. The reaction pathway of this stage is shown
in Movie S4 of the Supporting Information.
The calculated activation barrier for this step is 13.0 kcal/mol. Table 3 summarizes the energy
of all stationary points.

Conclusions
Currently, it is generally accepted that
all classes of β-lactamases
share a common feature in their catalytic mechanism that consists
of the emergence of one or more tetrahedral intermediates along the
reaction pathway.13 The results reported
herein show that the mechanism of deacylation of the OXA-24/avibactam
complex involves a two-stage mechanism, in which the first stage corresponds
to the formation of a dianionic intermediate with a calculated activation
barrier of 24.0 kcal/mol; this high value is due to the deprotonation
of the aminosulfate nitrogen. The geometric parameters, angles, and
interatomic distances of the optimized structure of the intermediate
INT along with the NBO results (bond orders and atomic partial charges)
are consistent with a hybridization sp2 for the C7 carbonyl atom, evidencing the nonoccurrence of a tetrahedral intermediate.
The second stage corresponds to the cleavage of the Ser81–C7 bond promoted by the protonation of the OS81 atom
through the carboxylated Lys84, and the concomitant recyclization
of avibactam as a consequence of the nucleophilic attack of the N6 atom on the C7 carbonyl carbon. The calculated
activation barrier for the second stage is 13.0 (kcal/mol). In consequence,
the first stage is the rate-determining step, in good agreement with
that postulated by Lahiri et al.8

The above results suggest that the recyclization of avibactam from
the OXA-24/avibactam complex may occur without the emergence of any
tetrahedral intermediates, unlike that observed in the class A CTX-M.15.13 This finding may be explained in terms of the
particularities of the active sites in class D β-lactamases.
OXAs are much more hydrophobic than those of class A and C; thus,
the conserved asparagine, in class A and C, is replaced by valine,
isoleucine, or leucine in class D.8 This
hydrophobic nature of class D is necessary to promote the carboxylation
of Lys84 to form the carbamate. In some cases, carbamates are implicated
in substrate binding or directly in catalysis, like the observed in
the present study. This hydrophobic environment may explain the nonoccurrence
of tetrahedral intermediates in OXAs, as their formation should involve
the emergence of an oxyanion which would be highly disfavored in this
hydrophobic ambient.

Computational Methods
The methodology used has been
reported in previous articles,14−16 and details on the MD simulations
are included in the Supporting Information. In brief, the initial
structure of the OXA-24/avibactam complex determined at 2.4 Å,
PDB code 4WM9,8 was used. All ionizable residues were
set to the states corresponding to pH 7.0 using Propka3, and all crystalline
waters were considered. The system was solvated with a cubic box (80
× 96 × 72 Å3) of water molecules centered
in the enzyme–inhibitor complex. The final system contains
46 766 atoms, of which 42 816 atoms correspond to water
molecules, and the difference corresponds to the protein, avibactam,
and ion atoms. The total system was divided into a quantum mechanics
zone, QM, including avibactam, Ser81, Lys84, Ser128, Lys218, and Arg261
side chains; whereas the molecular mechanics region, MM, contains
the rest of the system. The total charge in the QM zone is null; and
the link atom method was applied to the boundary atoms. For clarity
on the labels of atoms, a reduced representation of the active site
is shown in Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 Reduced Labeled Scheme of the QM Zone
Calculations were performed at M06-2X/6-31+G(d,p)17 level of theory using the Q-Chem/CHARMM interface.18 The PESs were investigated in terms of the reaction
coordinates defined above with steps of 0.1 Å.

The Q-Chem
software was used to explore the PES by geometry optimizations
of the movable part of the system using harmonic constraints (RESDmodule)
on the reaction coordinates described above. Energy minimizations
were performed by means of relaxed scans with a gradient tolerance
of 0.001 kcal/mol by the ABNR algorithm.19

The QM region was investigated at the M06-2X/6-31+G(d,p) level,
whereas for the MM region, the CHARMM36 force field was employed.
The interaction between QM and MM zones was described by the electrostatic
embedding method. The search of the transition states was accomplished
on a clusterized model comprising avibactam and those residues in
the QM zone. The level of theory used is the same mentioned above,
and Jaguar20 was used for the respective
characterization. The technique uses a simple quasi-Newton method
that looks for the transition state nearest to the initial geometry.20 NBO analysis, to characterize the intermediate
and transition states, was performed using NBO621 as implemented in Jaguar. The ligand–protein interactions
were calculated with Desmond 5.5.13
