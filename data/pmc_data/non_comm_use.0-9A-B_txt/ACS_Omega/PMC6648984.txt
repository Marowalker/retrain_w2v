Voltage
enrichment-assisted surface-enhanced resonance Raman scattering
(SERRS) was employed for monitoring mercury(II) ions based on a nanoporous
gold (NPG)/aptamer hybrid sensor. The hybrid sensor based on the coordination
chemistry of thymine–Hg2+–thymine interaction
and an applied voltage that pushed mercury ions toward the NPG film
improved both the speed and sensitivity of Hg2+ ion detection.
The detection limit can reach 0.1 pM, even in the aqueous solution
containing 13 metal ions, and the sensor also possesses a fine reproducibility
and stability, promising great potential in real-time sensing applications.

==== Body
Introduction
Mercury ions (Hg2+), which
are extremely widespread
in nature, pose a serious threat for human health and the ecosystem.
The methylmercury ingested by aquatic organisms can accumulate in
the body and continue to accumulate through the food chain, which
would cause serious irreversible brain damage.1,2 Due
to the adverse effects of Hg2+ ions on human health and
safety, an ultrasensitive and real-time detection method of mercury
ions is of great significance in environmental protection and health
monitoring.3,4 Various methods have been developed to detect
mercury ions, such as electrochemical sensing,5,6 colorimetric
assays,7−9 atomic absorption spectroscopy,10−12 fluorescence
detection,13−15 and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS).16−18 Since Hg2+ is inactive to most optical spectroscopy,
Hg2+-sensitive molecular probes and tag labels have been
applied for detection,19,20 among which a metal ion-specific
aptamer was often used due to its excellent selectivity. In a previous
study, a nanoporous gold/aptamer-based surface-enhanced resonance
Raman scattering (SERRS) sensor showed sub-parts per trillion level
heavy metal ion sensitivity.4 In this study,
we further improved the detection efficiency of an aptamer-based SERRS
method via voltage enrichment Raman spectroscopy.21 Cy5-labeled aptamer-modified nanoporous gold was selected
as the substrate, and a constant voltage was applied to guide the
mercury ions toward the hybrid electrode to fasten the coordination
of mercury ions with aptamers, leading to higher detection efficiency
and detection limit. In addition, the voltage enrichment SERS does
not influence the selectivity of the hybrid sensor, and a 0.1 pM detection
limit for Hg2+ ions was achieved with interference of other
heavy metal ions in drinking water and groundwater.

Results and Discussion
Poly(thymine)-based aptamer-functionalized NPG has been proven
to be an excellent heavy metal ion optical sensor due to the large
surface-to-volume ratio and uniform intense local electromagnetic
field.4,22,23 A Hg2+-mediated base pair formed a thymine–Hg2+–thymine
(T–Hg2+–T) duplex structure, and the variation
of the structure was utilized for optical sensing.4 Consequently, the stabilizing effect of Hg2+ ions on T–T combination surpassed the effects of other metals
and appeared to be highly specific. In this study, a constant voltage
was applied to increase the density of the Hg2+ ions surrounding
the sensor substrate, which also works as the negative electrode of
the system. The application of voltage enrichment efficiently improved
the detection rate, and Figure 1 demonstrates the working mechanism. Figure 1a shows the scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) image of the NPG substrate used in this experiment, and the
characteristic length of nanopores and ligament is ∼27 ±
2 nm, which is estimated by a fast Fourier transform method.24Figure 1b illustrates the experimental setup for Hg2+ detection.

sensor for Hg2+ detection based on voltage enrichment.

A labeled aptamer with 15 thymines
(Apt15) was chosen to functionalize
the NPG film, and a Cy5 probe, which is resonant with 633 nm laser
excitation, is at the 3′ terminal of the oligonucleotide, and
an alkanethiol moiety, which can bond to the gold surface via a thiol
anchor, is at the 5′ terminal. The Apt15-functionalized NPG
film served as the working electrode and was stabilized in an optical
electrochemical cell for further measurement. As shown in Figure 1c, mercury ions are
guided toward the NPG film by electrostatic forces, which increase
the combination rate of mercury ions and aptamers.25 With the existence of Hg2+ ions, a pair of poly-T
oligonucleotides hybridized through the T–Hg2+–T
coordination reaction, and the duplex-like complex is as relatively
rigid as a normal DNA duplex and then draws the Cy5 tags far away
from the NPG surface, leading to the decrease in Raman signals from
Cy5 probes.26 Based on the mercury ion-induced
hybridization, when voltage is applied, the amount of mercury ions
around the NPG film can effectively increase in a short time and enables
mercury ions to bind to the aptamer faster, thereupon improving the
detection sensitivity and detection speed. The sensitive and quantitative
detection of Hg2+ ions is performed by monitoring the intensity
changes of Raman signals with Hg2+ ion concentrations.

According to the correlation between the characteristic Raman peak
intensity and the mercury ion concentration, the strongest Raman peak
of Cy5 at 1362 cm–1 was selected for quantitative
analysis. Figure 2a
shows the baseline-corrected SERRS spectra of Cy5 tags obtained on
the Apt15-modified NPG film. The relative intensity of the SERRS signals
from Cy5 tags decreases with increasing concentration of Hg2+ ions, and the application of voltage further enlarges the intensity
variation. Two relative stronger bands at 555 and 1362 cm–1 were chosen for quantitative analysis based on the intensity dependence
of the characteristic Raman peaks on Hg2+ concentrations.
As shown in Figure 2b,c, the variation ratios of the selected characteristic peaks are
the same. When 0.1 pM Hg2+is added, the detectable Raman
peak intensity drop of ∼5% (Figure 2d,e) can be measured for the one without
voltage; further, when voltage is applied, the intensity drops to
∼13% (Figure 2d,e). In general, the decrease in the Raman intensity with an applied
voltage is more than twice as large as that without voltage. Apparently,
the optical sensor assistant with voltage enrichment can improve the
sensitivity by several orders of magnitude. In a previous study, the
detection limit of 15-thymine aptamer-functionalized NPG was around
1 nM;4 attractively, combining with voltage
assistant ion beneficiation, the detection limit approached 0.1 pM
with a dynamic detection range up to 10 μM, which is four orders
of magnitude wider than that without an applied voltage.4

of Cy5 from the sensor in PBS buffer only. Square, sensor with an
applied voltage in solution without Hg2+; triangle, sensor
without an applied voltage in solution with various Hg2+ concentrations; circle, sensor with an applied voltage in solution
with various Hg2+ concentrations.

To verify the tolerance of the hybrid sensor, not
only the isolated
Hg2+ ions but also mixtures that are analogous to the natural
environments were detected. The T–Hg2+–T
interaction has high specificity and provides eminent selectivity
for the detection of Hg2+ in water. As shown in Figure 3 (circle), Hg2+ was first mixed with five other metal ions (Ca2+, Cr3+, Na+, Zn2+, and K+), and their concentrations are the same as that of Hg2+ ions. The interference from five metal ions can only decrease the
sensitivity slightly, and an approximately 20% reduction of the Raman
signal still remains in the presence of 1 pM Hg2+. Then,
we further added seven ions (Cd2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Cu2+, Co2+, Mg2+, and
Ti4+) to the solution, and an around 15% decrease exists
in the presence of 1 pM Hg2+. Apparently, the hybrid sensor
with an applied voltage still has good selectivity in the mixed solution
of various ions.

different
concentrations. Square, solution containing only Hg2+;
circle (mixed), solution containing Hg2+, Ca2+, Cr3+, Na+, Zn2+, and K+ with the same concentration; triangle (super-mixed), solution containing
Hg2+, Ca2+, Cr3+, Na+,
Zn2+, K+, Cd2+, Ni2+,
Mn2+, Cu2+, Co2+, Mg2+, and Ti4+ with the same concentration.

The repeatability of the sensor with an applied
voltage was also
confirmed, and the sensor can be reused around seven times without
loss of activity (Figure 4). The sensor was regenerated by immerging in 100 mM ascorbic
acid solution for 1 h and then washed with 33 mM PBS buffer (pH= 6.9)
solution for 15 min.5Figure 4 displays seven representative
cycles of the hybrid sensor for detecting 0.1 nM Hg2+ in
aqueous solution. Compared to the original Raman peak, it is observed
that the Raman peak with 0.1 nM Hg2+ is reduced to 70–80%
with the variation ratio about 5–8% within each cycle. Although
the relative intensity of the SERRS signal from the immobilized aptamers
cannot be fully recovered, the variation is less than 10%.

0.1 nM in the aqueous solution for seven cycles.

Conclusions
We have developed a method for constructing
an optical sensor assistant
with voltage enrichment to detect Hg2+ ions. The function
of applying a voltage pushes the Hg2+ ions toward the aptamer
quickly, leading to the efficient and sensitive detection of Hg2+ ions. Compared to previous works about mercury detection
based on NPG/aptamer SERRS sensors without voltage enrichment, we
have proved that the hybrid method is more efficient and sensitive.
Hg2+ ions can be detected at concentrations as low as 0.1
pM with a dynamic detection range of eight orders of magnitudes. Given
these advantages, it is an excellent way to detect Hg2+ pollution in drinking water and groundwater and even in body fluids.
This hybrid sensor is expected to have considerable potential in the
application of real-time detection of Hg2+ ions.

Experimental
Methods
Materials and Equipment
The synthesized aptamer was
supplied by TaKaRa Biotech. Mercury pernitrate and 69% nitric acid
were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. The electrochemical
workstation (Chi1230C) was produced by Chenhua. Ultrapure water (18.25
MΩ*cm) was produced by a machine from Chengdu Youpu Biotechnology
Co., Ltd. A scanning electron microscope (SEM, ThermoFisher Scientific,
USA) and a homemade Raman spectroscope were used for microstructure
characterization and spectral measurement.

Preparation of Nanoporous
Gold Films
The 100 nm-thick
NPG films were prepared by selective corrosion of Ag from Ag65Au35 (atom %) alloy leaves, making use of 69% nitric acid
for 10 min at room temperature.27,28 The prepared films
were washed several times with ultrapure water to wash away the residual
nitric acid. Then, the NPG films were fixed on the indium tin oxide
(ITO) glass and annealed at 100 °C for 2 h to ensure that the
films could be stably combined with it.

Aptamer–NPG Hybrid
Optical Sensor
The sequence
of synthetic aptamer (5′-SH-(CH2)6-(TTT...)15-Cy5-3′) was synthesized by Shanghai Haojia Technology
Development Co., Ltd. The NPG substrates fixed on the ITO glass were
immersed in the 0.5 mL aptamer solution containing 100 nM aptamer
and 1.0 M NaCl in 10 mM PBS buffer (pH = 7.4) for 12 h at room temperature
to allow aptamers to self-assemble on the substrates. After washing
with PBS buffer (pH = 6.9) containing 0.5 M NaCl and 0.1 M NaClO4 several times, the sensor was preserved in PBS buffer at
5 °C and can maintain the activity for beyond 30 days.

Raman
Spectroscopy
A Raman spectrometer with 632.8
nm laser excitation was used for Raman measurements. The experimental
device is shown in Figure 1, the NPG films covered with the ITO glass was connected to
the working electrode, and the platinum wire was inserted into one
side of the round sample stage working as the counter electrode, and
then a PBS buffer (pH = 6.9) solution with different concentrations
of metal ions was filled in the stage as the electrolyte. The power
of laser for Raman measurements was set to 0.03 mW to avoid excessive
damage of the molecule. The SERRS spectrum was the average of at least
five spectra obtained on the substrate after supplying a constant
voltage (−0.5 V) for 5 min.
