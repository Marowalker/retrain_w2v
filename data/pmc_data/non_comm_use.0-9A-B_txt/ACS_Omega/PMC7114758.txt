In
one-pot strategy, diazotization of methyl anthranilate 5 followed by addition of amino acid ester hydrochloride,
we have prepared methyl-2-(4-oxobenzotriazin-3(4H)-yl)alkanoates 6a–c. Starting with
hydrazides 7a,b, N-alkyl-2-(4-oxobenzotriazin-3(4H)-yl)alkanamides 9–10(a–h) and methyl-2-(2-(4-oxobenzotriazin-3(4H)-yl)alkanamido)alkanoates 11–12(a–e) were prepared via
azide coupling. Hydrazones 13–15 were
prepared via condensation of hydrazides 7a,b with 4-methoxybenzaldehyde, 4-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde, and/or
arabinose. Molecular docking was done for synthesized compounds using
MOE 2008-10 software. The compounds 9a, 12a, 12c, 13a, 13b, and 14b have the most pronounced strong binding affinities toward
the target E. coli Fab-H receptor,
whereas compounds 3, 11e, 12e, and 13a have the most pronounced strong binding affinities
toward the target vitamin D receptor. The in vitro antibacterial activities
of the highest binding affinity docked compounds were tested against E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella spp. Majority of
the tested compounds showed effective positive results against E. coli, while they were almost inactive against Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella
spp. The in vitro cytotoxic activities
of the highest binding affinity-docked compounds were tested against
the human liver carcinoma cell line (HepG2). Some compounds showed
potent cytotoxic activity with low IC50 values, especially
for 3 (6.525 μM) and 13a (10.97 μM) than that for standard drug doxorubicin (2.06 μM).

Introduction
Cancer
is one of the major health challenges for all nations. Chemotherapy
is one of the most effective targets used to heal malignancy. The
main disadvantages of cancer chemotherapy are the dangerous side effects
associated with it such as vomiting and spinal depression in addition
to a lack of selectivity of drugs against the tumor cellular substance
in the tumor compared to normal cellular substances. Hence, the search
for anti-cancer drugs is the latest task that never ends. Benzotriazinones
are key interactions at protein–protein interfaces that constitute
important targets for small molecule inhibition because of their specific
arrangements and biological importance. Therefore, one of the most
corner stone principles in our research group is based on searching
for new anticancer drugs.1,2 Benzotriazine and its
derivatives possess a diverse range of biological activities of pharmacological
activities including antimicrobial,3 anti-inflammatory,4 anti-depressant,5 anti-ulcer,6 anti-diarrhoeal,7 anaesthetics,8 and anti-cancer.9 Some
current commercial benzotriazinone anticancer drugs such as α-hydroxylatedbenzotriazinone10 (A), N-arylbenzotriazinones11 (B), tirapazamine (1,2,4-benzotriazin-3-amine,1,4-dioxide)12 (C), and 4-[(4-oxobenzotriazin-3(4H)-yl)methyl]benzoic acid13 (D) show the
possibilities to reduce recombinant human cancer cell growth in a
culture.

One of the most important benzotriazin-4(3H)-one
derivatives is 3-hydroxy-1,2,3-benzotriazin-4(3H)-one,
which is one as a versatile reagent employed for peptide synthesis
(Figure 1).14

Figure 1 Some current commercial benzotriazinone anticancer drugs.

Due to the importance of vitamin D, which has been
produced by
plants and animals, we used the vitamin D receptor in our docking
investigation. VDR is found in almost all cells and tissues of higher-order
animals, further emphasizing the importance of the receptor. Evidence
for the existence of VDR was first provided in 1969 by Haussler and
Norman,15 and since then a substantial
amount of data on the structure and function of VDR has been accomplished.

In the present work, we aimed to synthesize a series of compounds
containing benzotriazinone moieties on the basis of structure modification
of methyl-2-(4-oxobenzotriazin-3(4H)-yl)alkanoates 6a–c for biological evaluation as antimicrobial
and anticancer agents.

Results and Discussion
Chemistry
Early
attempts for preparing 6a–c as the
target molecules for structure modification
of benzotriazinone were achieved from isatoic anhydride 1. Isatoic anhydride 1 was reacted with ammonia in the
presence of ammonium carbonate to give anthranilamide 2, which subsequently diazotized using sodium nitrite and HCl solution
at 0 °C to give benzotriazinone 3. Similarly, 3 was also formed by diazotization of anthranilhydrazide 4 in a moderate yield. Benzotriazinone 3 was
reacted with methyl chloroacetate in DMF in the presence of potassium
carbonate at 100 °C to give the chemoselective N-alkylated ester, methyl-2-(4-oxobenzotriazin-3(4H)-yl)acetate 6a as the only product on the basis of
chemoselective reactivity of heterocyclic amides toward electrophiles, Scheme 1.16−18 The multistep
reactions mentioned gave 6a in an overall high yield
from available isatoic anhydride, but the alkyl halides needed to
prepare other methyl-2-(4-oxobenzotriazin-3(4H)-yl)alkanoates 6b–c were not available.

Scheme 1 Multistep
Method for Preparation of Methyl 2-(4-Oxobenzotriazin-3(4H)-yl)acetate 6a
Diazotization of methyl anthranilate 5 using sodium
nitrite and HCl solution at 0 °C followed by addition of amino
acid ester hydrochloride in the presence of triethyl amine in a one-pot
strategy affording methyl-2-(4-oxobenzotriazin-3(4H)-yl)alkanoates 6a–c in excellent
yields, Scheme 2. This
method has the advantage of simple work up, one pot, and the availability
of reagents.

Scheme 2 Direct Preparation of Methyl 2-(4-Oxobenzotriazin-3(4H)-yl)alkanoates 6a–c and
Corresponding
Hydrazides 7a,b
The structure assignment of methyl-2-(4-oxobenzotriazin-3(4H)-yl)alkanoates 6a–c is
based on full characterization, including 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies. Thus, the 1H NMR spectrum of methyl-3-(4-oxobenzotriazin-3(4H)-yl)propanoate 6b revealed signals at δ
4.73–4.68, 3.65, and 2.95–2.89 ppm for OCH3, NCH2, and CH2CO groups, respectively. The 13C NMR spectrum of 6b showed signals at δ
171.0, 155.3, 51.9, 45.5, and 33.0 ppm for 2C=O groups, OCH3, NCH2, and CH2CO groups, respectively.

Methyl-2-(4-oxobenzotriazin-3(4H)-yl)alkanoates 6a–c are excellent precursors for structure
modification of the benzotriazinone ring system via the azide coupling
method by an attachment of either amines or amino acid through a peptide
bond. Thus, the esters 6a,b were reacted
with hydrazine hydrate in ethanol under reflux condition for 6 h afforded
the corresponding hydrazides 7a,b, Scheme 2. Hydrazides 7a,b were reacted with NaNO2 and HCl
in water at 0 °C for 1 h to afford the corresponding azides 8a,b and were extracted with ethyl acetate. The
in situ generated azide 8a,b solution was
successively added to primary amines iso-propyl, n-butyl, tert-butyl, n-decyl, cyclohexyl, and benzyl amines and secondary amines piperidine
and morpholine to give N-alkyl-2-(4-oxobenzotriazin-3(4H)-yl)alkanamides 9–10(a–h) in good yields, Scheme 3.

Scheme 3 Azide Coupling Method
for the Preparation of N-alkyl-2-(4-oxobenzotriazin-3(4H)-yl)alkanamides 9–10(a–h)
Next, the in situ generated azide 8a and 8b solution was simultaneously added to amino acid
methyl ester hydrochloride glycine, l-leucine γ-aminobutyric
acid, β-alanine, and l-tryptophane to give methyl-2-(2-(4-oxobenzotriazin-3(4H)-yl)alkanamido)alkanoates (dipeptides) 11–12(a–e) in
good yields via the azide coupling method, Scheme 4.

Scheme 4 Azide Coupling Method for the Preparation
of Methyl 2-(2-(4-Oxobenzotriazin-3(4H)-yl)alkanamido)alkanoates
(Dipeptides) 11–12(a–e)
The structure assignments of N-alkyl-2-(4-oxobenzotriazin-3(4H)-yl)alkanamides 9–10(a–h) and methyl-2-(2-(4-oxobenzotriazin-3(4H)-yl)alkanamido)alkanoates (dipeptides) 11–12(a–e) are
based on full characterization, including 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies. Thus, the 1H NMR spectrum of methyl-2-(2-(4-oxobenzotriazin-3(4H)-yl)acetamido)acetate 11a showed signals
at δ 5.22, 4.14, and 3.77 ppm corresponding to NCH2, NHCH2, and OCH3, respectively. The 13C NMR spectrum of 11a showed signals at 170.1, 166.3,
155.9, 52.6, 52.5, and 41.4 ppm for 3C=O groups, OCH3, NCH2, and NHCH2 groups, respectively.

Also, a number of hydrazones 13–14(a,b) were prepared by condensation of
hydrazides 7a,b with some aldehydes, namely,
4-methoxybenzaldehyde and 4-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde, in ethanol
under reflux condition for 6 h and gave 13–14(a,b) in very good yields, Scheme 5.

Finally, the 3-(4-oxo-4H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazin-3-yl)-propionic
acid hydrazide 7b was condensed with arabinose in ethanol
under reflux condition for 6 h and gave 15, Scheme 6.

Biological Activity
Molecular Docking Methodology
Bioinformatics
including
molecular modeling studies are very valuable at the present time in
the field of drug discovery, saving money, and effort needed for the
screening of new compounds by guiding and confining the investigation
to possible target/targets. The use of docking simulation studies
in our work is quite important to help in predicting the possible
mode of the action and structure activity relationship of the active
derivatives and guiding the research future directions in the compound
optimization and biochemical enzyme assay for the possible target
enzymes. Key interactions at protein–protein interfaces constitute
important targets for small molecule inhibition because of their specific
arrangements and biological importance.19

All the molecular modeling studies were carried out on Intel
Core i3 CPU, 2.40 GHZ processor and 3 GB memory with a Windows 7 operating
system using Molecular Operating Environment (MOE 2008-10 Chemical
Computing Group, Canada) as the computational software. Anti-bacterial
activities of the synthesized benzotriazinone derivatives were investigated
through correlation with E. coli Fab-H
inhibitory activities, and the anti-cancer activities of compounds
were screened through detection of their abilities to act as the vitamin
D receptor. The crystal structure of the E. coli FabH-CoA complex (PDB code: 1HNJ) and the crystal structure of the nuclear
receptor for vitamin D bound to its natural ligand (PDB code: 1DB1) were obtained from
the freely accessible protein data bank. The docking studies were
performed after the verification process, which was performed by redocking
of the cocrystallized ligand into the active site using the default
settings. The synthesized compounds were docked within the active
sites of the crystallized structures using the MOE dock tool in MOE,
performed with the default values. Different conformers for each compound
are imported by systematic conformational of the MOE and saved in
an mdb data base file to be docked into the active site of the receptor.
Each complex was analyzed for the interaction, and 2D and 3D images
were taken by using the MOE visualizing tool.

The results were
evaluated based on binding affinity calculation
together with cluster size determination and visually through the
possible interaction with key residues at the active site.

In Vitro Anti-cancer Activity
Potential cytotoxicity
of the newly synthesized compounds was tested against the human liver
carcinoma cell line (HepG2) using the method of Hansen et al.20 The in vitro anticancer screening was done by
planting a tissue unit in Vacsera, Cairo A. R. Egypt.

This work
was performed by a modification (Hansen et al., 1989)20 of the tetrazolium salt (MTT) method, Mosmann, 1983.21 Preferably, cells should be plated in triplicate
wells. Relative cell proliferation/viability was measured when treated
cells are compared with untreated cells.

The in vitro cytotoxic
activities of the highest binding affinity
docked compounds were tested against human liver carcinoma (HepG2)
cancer cell lines. Many compounds showed potent cytotoxic activities
with low IC50 values, especially for 3 (6.525
μM) and 13a (10.97 μM), than
that for standard drug doxorubicin (2.06 μM).

On regarding
IC50 values, It is clear that the tryptophan amino
acid fragments enhanced the benzotriazinone anticancer activities.
Moreover, the hydrazone 13a derived from methoxy benzaldehyde
in the case of glycine was more active than that of one derived from
β-alanine.

Conclusions
A series of 36 compounds
were synthesized based on structure modification
of the model benzotriazinone 3 as a potent HepG2 liver
carcinoma inhibitor. Different benzotriazinone derivatives were synthesized
via different chemistry protocols to obtain 2-(4-oxobenzotriazin-3(4H)-yl)alkanoates methyl esters, 2-(4-oxobenzotriazin-3(4H)-yl)alkanamide derivatives, and 2-(2-(4-oxobenzotriazin-3(4H)-yl)alkanamido)alkanoates methyl esters. The hydrazones
of some hydrazides were obtained by reactions with some aldehydes
and/or arabinose. Applying of Molecular docking on synthesized compounds
leads us to choose the most promising derivatives for further biological
studies. Some compounds possess strong binding affinity toward the
target E.coli Fab-H receptor. Moreover,
some compounds had strong binding affinity toward the target vitamin
D receptor. The in vitro antibacterial activities of the highest binding
affinity docked compounds gave effective positive results against E. coli. On the other hand, the in vitro cytotoxic
activities were tested against the human liver carcinoma cell line
(HepG2), and IC50 values of compounds 3, 11e, 12e, and 13a were 6.525, 12.4019, 59.85,
and 10.97ug/mL respectively.

Syntheses of N-alkyl-2-(4-oxobenzotriazin-3(4H)-yl)alkanamides
(9–10(a–h))
To a cold solution
(− 5 °C) of hydrazides 7a,b (8.0
mmol) in acetic acid (60 mL), hydrochloric acid (5 N, 30 mL) was added portionwise under stirring a cold solution (0
°C) of sodium nitrite (0.7 g, 10.0 mmol) in water (30 mL). After
stirring at the same temperature for 30 min, the in situ generated
azide 8a,b was extracted with cold ethyl
acetate and washed successively with cold water, 5% NaHCO3, and water. After drying over anhydrous sodium sulfate, the azide 8a,b was used without further purification in
the next step. Amines (9.0 mmol) were added to the previously prepared
cold dried solution of the azide 8a,b. Afterward,
the mixture was kept for 12 h in the refrigerator and then at room
temperature for another 12 h. The reaction mixture was washed with
0.1 N HCl, water, 5% NaHCO3, and water then dried over
anhydrous sodium sulfate, the solvent was evaporated in vacuum and
the residue was crystallized from ethyl acetate-petroleum ether to
give products 9–10(a–h).

General Procedure
for Dipeptides Methyl 2-(2-(4-Oxobenzotriazin-3(4H)-yl)alkanamido)alkanoates (Dipeptides) (11–12(a–e))
To a cold
solution (−5 °C) of hydrazides (7a,b) (1.6 mmol) in acetic acid (12 mL), hydrochloric
acid (5 N, 6 mL) and water (50 mL) were added portionwise
under stirring a cold solution (0 °C) of sodium nitrite (0.14
g, 2.0 mmol) in water (6 mL). After stirring at the same temperature
for 30 min, the azides 8a,b were extracted
with cold ethyl acetate and washed successively with cold water, 5%
NaHCO3, and water. After drying over anhydrous sodium sulfate,
azides were used directly without further purification in the next
step. Amino acid methyl ester hydrochlorides (1.8 mmol) were stirred
in ethyl acetate (50 mL) with triethyl amine (0.2 mL) at 0 °C
for 20 min. The formed triethyl amine hydrochloride was filtered off,
and the filtrate was added to the previously prepared cold-dried solution
of the azide. Afterward, the mixture was kept for 12 h in the refrigerator
and then at room temperature for another 12 h. The reaction mixture
was washed with 0.1 N HCl, water, 5% NaHCO3, and water
then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated
in vacuum, and the residue was crystallized from ethyl acetate-petroleum
ether to give the appropriate products 11–12(a–-e).

Experimental Part of Anti-cancer Activity (HEPG −2 Cell
Line)
In Vitro Anti-cancer Activity
Potential cytotoxicity
of the newly synthesized compounds was tested against the human liver
carcinoma cell line (HepG2) using the method of Hansen et al.19 The in vitro anticancer screening
was done by planting a tissue unit in Vacsera, Cairo A. R. Egypt.

This assay was performed by a modification (Hansen et al., 1989)
of the tetrazolium salt (MTT) method (Mosmann, 1983).20 Preferably, cells should be planted in triplicate wells.
Relative cell proliferation/viability was measured when treated cells
are compared with untreated cells.1. To each well of a 96-well flat-bottomed
plate, add 25 μL of MTT (5 mg/mL stock solution).

2. Incubate 2 h at 37o C.

3. Add 100 μL of extraction
buffer.

4. Incubate overnight
at 37° C.

5. Read
OD570.

6. Include negative
controls of no cells
and extraction buffer as the blank.

7. Note: it is not necessary to remove
medium prior to addition of reagents or to mix reagents in the well.



Reagent Preparation
MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenylterazolium
bromide; Sigma cat. no. M2128) is dissolved at a concentration of
5 mg/mL in sterile PBS at room temperature. The filter sterilized
and stored in a dark container at 4 °C. Prepare fresh each month,
extraction buffer 20% (W.V) was dissolved at 37 °C in a solution
of 50% DMF (N,N-dimethyl formamide;
Fluka cat. no. 40250) and 50% SDW. Adjust pH to 4.7 by adding 2.5%
of 80% acetic acid and 2.5% 1 N HCl.

This is a colorimetric
assay that measures the reduction of yellow 3-(4,5-dimethythiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl
tetrazolium bromide (MTT) by mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase.
The MTT enters the cells and passes into the mitochondria where it
is reduced to an insoluble, colored (dark purple) form azan product.
The cells are then solubilized with an organic solvent (e.g., isopropanol),
and the released, solubilized formazan reagent is measured spectrophotometrically.
Since reduction of MTT can only occur in metabolically active cells,
the level of activity is a measure of the viability of the cells.

Materials
MTT (5 mg/mL in PBS), filter and keep dark,
prepare freshly acidic isopropanol (0.1 N HCl in absolute isopropanol)
96-well plate (flat bottom).

Procedure
1. Plate cells (104–106
cells)
in 200 mL of PBS in 96-well (flat bottom).

2. Add 20 mL of MTT solution, mix well.

3. Incubate for 4 h in 37 °C in dark.

4. Remove the aliquot for
analysis, add
200 mL acidic isopropanol, and mix well.

5. Incubate additional 1 h in dark at
37 °C.

6. Read plate
in the ELISA reader, measure
OD in 570 nm (the background wavelength is 630 nm).



As shown in the Table 1, the compound 3 shown an IC50 of 6.525 μg/mL whereas the derivatives 11e shown
an IC50 of 12.40 μg/mL, 13a shown an
IC50 of 10.97 μg/mL, and compound 12e shown an IC50 of 59.85 μg/mL. In comparing with
the Doxorubicin standard IC50 of 2.06 μg/mL, We found
that the starting material benzotriazinone 3 was the
highest active compound having an IC50 of 6.525 μg/mL;
this result showed that the starting material compound 3 need more attention as an anti-cancer drugs. We hope that these
potential anticancer compounds could offer an effective treatment
that is less likely to cause resistance and recurrence of cancer and
less toxic to normal tissues than available chemotherapeutic agents.
