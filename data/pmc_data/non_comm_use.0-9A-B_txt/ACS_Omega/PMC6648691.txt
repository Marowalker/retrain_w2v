Hybrid photovoltaics (HPVs) incorporating
both organic and inorganic
semiconducting materials have attracted much attention as next-generation
photovoltaics because of their advantage of combining both materials.
The hybridization of ZnO nanowires (NWs) and organic semiconductors
is expected to be a suitable approach to overcome the limited exciton
diffusion length and low electron mobility associated with current
organic photovoltaics. The use of ZnO NWs allows researchers to tune
nanoscale dimensions more precisely and to achieve rod-to-rod spacing
below 10 nm. However, the perfect incorporation of organic semiconductors
into densely packed ZnO NW arrays has yet to be achieved. In this
study, we report the fabrication of ZnO NW arrays and various organic
heterojunction-based HPVs using the feasible and effective vacuum-assisted
double coating (VADC) method, achieving full coverage of the organic
semiconductors on the compact ZnO NW arrays. The newly proposed VADC
method ensures perfect infiltration and full coverage of the organic
semiconductors on the densely packed NW arrays. Compared with the
conventional single spin-coating process, the use of the VADC method
led to 11 and 14% increases in the power conversion efficiency of
P3HT:PCBM- and PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM-based HPVs, respectively.
Our studies provide a feasible method for the fabrication of efficient
HPVs.

1 Introduction
Organic
semiconductor-based photovoltaics (OPVs) have attracted
a great deal of attention for their use in next-generation photovoltaics
because of their potential advantages including light weight, mechanical
flexibility, and low-cost fabrication over a large area.1−4 Although the performance of OPVs has been rapidly improved by molecular
design,4,5 crystallinity and morphology control,6,7 and the introduction of light trapping structures,8,9 OPVs still have the limitation of short exciton diffusion lengths
(several tenths of nanometers) compared with inorganic material-based
photovoltaics (PVs).2,10,11 An exciton diffusion bottleneck of conjugated polymers results in
photogenerated excitons failing to reach the donor/acceptor interface.
This causes the recombination of excitons and is a limitation of OPV
efficiencies. Moreover, organic semiconductors show intrinsically
low-charge carrier mobilities and limited stability under ambient
conditions, which limits the performance of OPVs.12−14

To overcome
these limitations, the inverted design of hybrid photovoltaics
(HPVs) incorporating both organic/inorganic semiconducting materials
has been introduced extensively. The synergistic effect of both the
organic/inorganic materials present within the hybrid system has seen
improvements in both device performance and stability.15−21 For an efficient hybrid system, the use of ZnO nanowires (NWs) as
the inorganic component within the HPV is an attractive prospect.22−24 ZnO NWs are easily fabricated using a low-cost solution process
and possess a large surface area.25−30 In addition, the nanoscale dimensions are tunable, allowing rod-to-rod
spacing below 10 nm.28 It is anticipated
that incorporating highly ordered ZnO NWs within the organic bulk
heterojunction (BHJ) will result in a large increase in the interfacial
area; this is expected to solve the limits about short exciton diffusion
lengths and low electron mobilities observed with OPVs.22,31−36 In addition, the inverted structure of HPVs, fabricated by coating
the top anodes with high work-function metals such as Au, Ag and Cu,
can play an important role in overcoming the limited device stability
of HPVs.37−41 Despite the benefits of combining organic semiconductors with ZnO
NWs for HPVs, inefficient infiltration and partial interfacial contact
between the organic semiconductors and densely packed ZnO NWs has
been found to reduce the performance of HPVs.31,42,43 Therefore, to improve the performance of
HPVs, novel methods of fabricating an ideal hybrid film, in which
organic semiconductors are completely incorporated into ZnO NWs, are
needed. This will further improve our understanding of their photophysical
properties and the extent to which these systems can be used in practical
applications.

In this study, we introduce the vacuum-assisted
double coating
(VADC) method for the perfect infiltration and full interfacial contact
of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):[6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric
acid methyl ester (PCBM), poly((4,8-bis-(2-ethyl-hexyl-thiophene-5-yl)-benzo[1,2-b,4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)-alt-(2-(2′-ethyl-hexanoyl)-thieno[3,4-b]thiophen-4,6-diyl)) (PBDTTT-C-T):[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric
acid methyl ester (PC71BM) and ZnO NWs. We selected these
organic materials for HPVs to demonstrate that the VADC method can
be applied to the processing of a variety of organic semiconductor
materials. P3HT:PCBM is the most widely used material in OPVs that
require additional annealing processes, and PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM is a highly efficient organic material for OPVs that do not require
additional annealing.44−46 The newly proposed VADC method greatly improved the
infiltration of the organic semiconductors within the densely packed
ZnO NW arrays, leading to 11 and 14% increases in the power conversion
efficiency (PCE) of P3HT:PCBM- and PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM-based
inverted HPVs, respectively, compared with the conventional single
spin-coating method. Our studies provide an effective route to achieve
ideal interfacial contact between the inorganic nanostructures and
organic semiconductors, leading to an efficient heterojunction and
higher HPV performance.

2 Results and Discussion
The vertically aligned ZnO NW arrays with large surface areas and
compact interspacing between NWs were uniformly grown on the surface
of the glass/indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO substrates via a sol–gel
process of the ZnO seed layer (∼50 nm in thickness) and further
hydrothermal synthesis.29,30 In addition, both the
length and diameter of the ZnO NWs could be easily adjusted by changing
the growth parameters such as temperature, time, and solution concentration. Figure 1a,b shows the typical
top-view and cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images
of the ZnO NW arrays, respectively. The vertically aligned ZnO NW
arrays were grown at an optimized density and uniform length scale
(100 ± 12 nm) and diameter (23 ± 1 nm). The crystallinity
of hydrothermally grown ZnO NWs was also subjected to X-ray diffraction
analysis (Figure 1c).
X-ray diffraction patterns obtained from the ZnO NWs showed prominent
peaks at 2θ of 31.7°, 34°, and 36°, corresponding
to (100), (002), and (101) reflections, respectively. Although the
hydrothermally grown ZnO NWs have slightly low crystalline peak intensity
due to the limited growing time for molecular arrangement in ZnO NWs,
the peak patterns of as-synthesized ZnO NWs are matched perfectly
with the crystalline index of references.

top view and (b) cross-sectional view of
ZnO NWs. (c) X-ray diffraction pattern of the glass/ITO/ZnO/ZnO NW
substrate.

Initially, HPVs were fabricated
using P3HT and PCBM as donor and
acceptor materials, respectively, as they have been widely used over
the past decade in OPV research. A schematic image with molecular
structures of the organic semiconductors and energy diagram of the
inverted HPVs consisting of glass/ITO/ZnO/ZnO NWs/P3HT:PCBM/MoO3/Au are shown in Figure 2a,b, respectively (band gaps of P3HT and PCBM are ∼2.4
and ∼2 eV, respectively).44,47 Due to the
inverted structure of the HPVs, the electrical current flows inversely
compared with conventional HPVs due to the utilization of high work-function
Au electrodes that are more stable and improve cell stability. In
this study, we used Au electrodes rather than Ag electrodes because
of the high air stability due to the higher work function of Au electrodes
compared to Ag electrodes,48 although Ag
electrodes were reported to show higher efficiency than gold electrodes
due to their high reflectivity.49 Moreover,
photons can be effectively absorbed by either ZnO NWs or the organic
BHJ layer.34 To begin, using a conventional
single spin-coating method, we fabricated HPVs by coating a P3HT:PCBM
solution, dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (ODCB), onto 100 nm-long
ZnO NWs that were present on a 50 nm-thick ZnO layer. The HPVs fabricated
by this method exhibited a low PCE of 3.25% (Figure 3a and Table 1) due to imperfect infiltration of the organic solution
into the densely packed ZnO NW arrays. The evidence of imperfect infiltration
of the organic solution into the ZnO NW arrays was confirmed by SEM
measurements. Figure 3b,c shows the SEM images before and after vacuum processing of the
hybrid film fabricated by the conventional spin-coating method, respectively.
It was confirmed that, upon applying vacuum treatment of the hybrid
film, the interspatial voids between the organic layer and the ZnO
NW layer was efficiently filled with the organic layer, resulting
in the sinkage of the organic layer. The poor interfacial quality
between the organic layer and inorganic nanostructures is a crucial
issue for the PCE of HPVs, affecting both the photogenerated charge
carrier collection and shunt resistance.32,50 Thus, the level of infiltration of the organic layer into ZnO NWs
determines the performance of the HPV systems.31,51

To overcome the infiltration problems observed by
the single spin-coating
method, we propose the use of the VADC method to remove interspatial
voids at the organic/inorganic interface and two-step coating of the
organic solution with different concentrations to help form a solid-state
organic layer (Figure 4a). A diluted organic solution was spin-coated on the ZnO NW layer
and then vacuum-treated to improve the infiltration. This was followed
by a second spin-coating method of a more concentrated (same concentration
of the conventional single spin-coating method) organic solution (see Experimental Section). Figure 4b shows an SEM image of the film that was
vacuum-treated after coating of the diluted organic solution on ZnO
NWs. The thin organic layer effectively filled the interspatial voids
between the organic layer and the ZnO NW layer by vacuum treatment.
After the secondary spin-coating treatment, the organic layer fully
covered the ZnO NW arrays, forming a smooth surface (Figure 4c). To investigate the morphologies
of the hybrid films, atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis was performed
(Figure S1, Supporting Information). The
average surface roughness of the VADC-based films was 8 nm, which
was smaller than that (13 nm) of the single spin-coating-based film.
Contact angle measurement results using a P3HT:PCBM solution (2 μL
droplet) onto only ZnO NWs and ZnO NWs with vacuum-treated single-coated
P3HT:PCBM layer are shown in Figure S2 (Supporting
Information). Both only ZnO NWs (contact angle = 11°) and ZnO
NWs with a vacuum-treated single-coated P3HT:PCBM layer (contact angle
= 15°) showed high affinity with the P3HT:PCBM solution. Only
ZnO NWs showed slightly better affinity with the organic solution
than ZnO NWs with a vacuum-treated single-coated P3HT:PCBM layer,
but there was no significant difference. The VADC method first forms
a thin organic photoactive layer on the lower part of the ZnO NWs
by a conventional coating method and a dense organic layer between
the ZnO NWs by coating the photoactive layer solution after vacuum
treatment. Therefore, this small affinity difference between these
substrates and organic solutions may not have a significant effect
on the formation of the compact hybrid films. The hybrid films prepared
by the VADC method exhibited higher light absorption characteristics
compared with the hybrid films prepared by the conventional single
spin-coating process due to the formation of a compact film without
interspatial voids and smooth surface (Figure S3, Supporting Information). In conjunction with the perfect
infiltration of P3HT:PCBM into the densely packed ZnO NW arrays, the
smooth surface morphology of the P3HT:PCBM layer obtained using the
VADC method enhanced the PCE in HPVs (vide infra).

Figure 4 (a) Schematic illustration
of the VADC process. SEM images of the
P3HT:PCBM-based hybrid film (b) after vacuum treatment during the
VADC process and (c) after the VADC process.

The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and P3HT:PCBM-based HPV performance parameters
are summarized in Figure 3a and Table 1, respectively. The HPVs fabricated using the VADC method showed
an improved PCE (∼11% increase from 3.25 to 3.62%) over HPVs
fabricated using the single spin-coating process. The short-circuit
current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage
(Voc), and fill factor (FF) values of
HPVs fabricated by VADC were enhanced compared with HPVs fabricated
by the single spin-coating method. The improvements in Voc and FF were attributed to an increase in shunt resistance
(Rsh) and a reduction in series resistance
(Rs), respectively. The increase in Jsc was due to a more efficient photogenerated
charge separation and a reduction in Rs. The changes in Rsh, Rs, and the photogenerated charge collection are all due
to a higher level of organic layer infiltration, leading to a denser
HPV device. The incident photon-to-charge carrier efficiency (IPCE)
characteristics of the HPVs are shown in Figure S4 (Supporting Information). By applying the VADC method, the
IPCEs of the HPVs increased between the wavelengths of 300 and 700
nm. This result indicates a significant improvement in the infiltration
of the organic layer into ZnO NWs, leading to an improvement in electrical
contact between them.

Moreover, it has been confirmed that VADC
is also effective for
improving the performance of PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM-based HPVs.
PBDTTT-C-T is another promising low band gap polymer for high-performance
OPVs. In the case of the PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM-based HPVs,
the organic solution was coated and then vacuumed at room temperature
without post-annealing to remove the solvent due to the thermal vulnerability
of PBDTTT-C-T. A schematic image with molecular structures of organic
semiconductors and energy diagram of the PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM-based HPVs are presented in Figure 5a,b, respectively (band gaps of PBDTTT-C-T and PC71BM are ∼1.8 and ∼2 eV, respectively).44,47Figure 5c,d shows
the SEM images before and after vacuum processing of the PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM-based hybrid film fabricated by the conventional spin-coating
method. Similar to the case of P3HT:PCBM films, the interspatial voids
between the organic layer and the ZnO NW layer were greatly reduced
by vacuum treatment and showed the sinkage of the organic layer. The
VADC method yielded the organic layer with a smooth surface on the
ZnO NW arrays (Figure 5e). The average surface roughness (9 nm) of the VADC-based hybrid
film was less than that (15 nm) of the single spin-coating-based hybrid
film (Figure S5, Supporting Information).
Furthermore, contact angle measurement results using a PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM solution onto only ZnO NWs and ZnO NWs with a vacuum-treated
single-coated PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM layer also showed similar
tendency to the P3HT:PCBM system as shown in Figure S6 (Supporting Information). Contact angle values of only ZnO
NWs and ZnO NWs with a vacuum-treated single-coated PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM layer were 10° and 11°, respectively. The J–V characteristics and PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM-based HPV performance parameters are summarized in Figure 6a and Table 2, respectively. The PCEs of
the PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM-based HPVs improved by 14% (from
5.73 to 6.53%) using the VADC method due to the enhancement of Jsc, Voc, and FF,
which is consistent with the results observed from the HPVs based
on P3HT:PCBM. The hybrid film fabricated by the VADC method also showed
enhanced light absorption characteristics compared with the hybrid
film fabricated by the conventional single spin-coating method (Figure 6b). Moreover, as
shown in Figure 6c,
the IPCE characteristics of the VADC-based HPVs were enhanced over
the absorption range between the wavelengths of 300 and 800 nm compared
with the single spin-coating-based HPVs. This is due to the perfect
infiltration of PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM into the densely packed
ZnO NW arrays and the formation of the smooth surface morphology of
the HPV devices.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated the fabrication
of HPVs based
on a ZnO NW/organic hybrid thin film adjoined to a compact ZnO hole-blocking
layer by means of the newly proposed VADC method. The VADC method
significantly improved the PCE of P3HT:PCBM- and PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM-based HPVs (by 11 and 14%, respectively) compared with
the HPVs fabricated by the conventional single spin-coating process.
The VADC method resulted in the efficient infiltration of the organic
semiconductors into the densely packed ZnO NW arrays. Our studies
provide an effective method to achieve perfect interfacial contact
between organic and inorganic nanostructures, resulting in the development
of high-performance HPV systems. We expect that these studies can
be utilized to enhance the performance of a wide range of HPVs.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Device Fabrication
The devices were
fabricated using an inverted structure of ITO glass/compact ZnO/ZnO
NWs/P3HT:PCBM or PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM/MoO3/Au.
The ITO glasses (EM index) were cleaned by sequential ultrasonic treatment
in detergent, deionized (DI) water, acetone, and isopropanol for 15
min. The ITO glasses were then treated by UV–ozone (O3) for 20 min. The compact ZnO buffer layer was prepared by spin-coating
a diethylzinc solution (0.37 M, obtained by adding 2 mL of a 1.1 M
diethylzinc solution in toluene to 4 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran, Merck)
on the ITO substrate and then baked at 110 °C for 10 min. The
ZnO NWs were hydrothermally grown in aqueous solution. To prepare
the growing solution of the ZnO NWs, equimolar amounts (25 ×
10–3 M) of Zn(NO3)2·xH2O (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich) and hexamethylenetetramine
(HMTA) (≥99.0%, Sigma-Aldrich) were dispersed in DI water by
sonication. Then, the compact ZnO buffer layer-deposited ZnO/ITO/glass
substrates were floated on the surface of the growing solution. The
length and diameter of the ZnO NWs were varied by controlling the
growth time. After finishing the growing ZnO NWs within 30 min, the
surface of the ZnO NWs was rinsed with DI water to remove excess ions
and aggregated ZnO precipitates. The photosensitive blend layer was
prepared using the single spin-coating or VADC method for tuning morphology.
For the single spin-coating method, an ODCB solution of P3HT:PCBM
(EM index) (15 mg, 12 mg/mL) or PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM (8 mg,
12 mg/mL) with a 3% (v/v) ratio of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO, EM index)
was spin-coated at 600 rpm for 60 s onto the UV–O3-treated ZnO NW grown cells. The P3HT:PCBM cells were subsequently
annealed at 110 °C for 20 min, and the PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM cells were placed in a vacuum chamber for 20 min (∼10–2 torr). For the VADC method, the active layer was
spin-coated using a double coating process. In the first coating process,
a 10-fold diluted solution of either P3HT:PCBM or PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM was spin-coated onto the UV–O3-treated
ZnO NW grown cells, and the whole sample was placed in a vacuum chamber
for 20 min (∼10–2 torr). Subsequently, the
undiluted organic solution was re-spin-coated onto the cells at 600
rpm for 60 s. The P3HT:PCBM cells were annealed at 110 °C for
20 min, and the PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM cells were placed in
a vacuum chamber for 20 min (∼10–2 torr).
Finally, a 5 nm-thick MoO3 layer and 130 nm-thick Au layer
were thermally deposited consecutively onto the photoactive layer
under vacuum (∼10–6 torr). The area of the
Au electrode defined the active area of the device as 10 mm2.

4.2 Measurement
The J–V characteristics of HPVs were measured
using the Keithley 2400A Source Measure Unit. The solar cell performance
was evaluated using the Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5 G) solar simulator
with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm–2. The
absorption and IPCE spectra were obtained using a spectrophotometer
(JASCO V0670) and QE/IPCE measurement system (QEX7 Serial #90), respectively.
IPCE measurements were obtained using a PV measurement OE system by
applying monochromatic light from a xenon lamp under ambient conditions.
The monochromatic light intensity was calibrated using a Si photodiode
with a 100 Hz cutoff. The SEM images were obtained using a Hitachi
cold SEM microscope. The AFM images were obtained using the Veeco
AFM microscope and Park System NX10 in tapping mode. The UV–vis
absorption spectra were measured on a spectrophotometer.
