Discovery of a nontoxic fluorescent
molecular probe to “light
up” specific cellular organelles is extremely essential to
understand dynamics of intracellular components. Here, we report a
new nontoxic mitochondria-targeted linear bithiazole compound, containing
trifluoroacetyl terminal groups, which emits intense blue fluorescence
and stained mitochondria of various cells. Interestingly, the power
of fluorescence is completely off when the bithiazole unit is stapled
by a carbonyl bridge.

Introduction
Mitochondria are the
highly populated organelles in all eukaryotic
cells and have various cellular functions.1,2 They
act as the powerhouse of all the eukaryotic cells, as these essential
organelles produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the key
molecule for maintaining various cell functions.3−5 Mitochondria’s
unique structural property containing a series of respiratory protein
complexes, which maintain the electron flow and the redox balance
through the respiratory chain, ultimately producing ATP.6−8 Moreover, they also play a crucial role in the regulation of ion
homeostasis and biogenesis of large intracellular molecules such as
lipid and various free radicals.3,6 Generally, the structure
of healthy mitochondria is observed to have an oval shaped morphology
and they are dynamic.2 Slight perturbation
in this crucial organelle causes various diseases such as cancer,
neurodegenerative diseases, and metabolic disorders.9 Therefore, visualization of mitochondria using a suitable
probe can be considered as an easy strategy for monitoring the mitochondria
and cellular health. There are few reports, which showed that a benzothiazolium-based
NIR probe10 and a benzothiadiazole-based
fluorescence probe11−13 target mitochondria. In addition, there are molecular
probes which target mitochondrial H2O214−16 as well as act like fluorescence thermometers and molecular probes.17−24 However, to the best of our knowledge, a mitochondria-targeted nontoxic
blue light-emitting fluorescent probe is rare. Toward this venture,
in this manuscript, we revealed a new mitochondria-targeted organic
molecular probe (named as linear bithiazole: LBT), which can specifically
illuminate the mitochondria of live cells with blue fluorescence.
Interestingly, we also found that fluorescence of this molecule was
completely off when the flexibility of this molecule was restricted
by a carbonyl bridge [named as bridged bithiazole (BBT)].

Results and Discussion
Here, we have used compounds containing a bithiazole unit and trifluoroacetyl
terminal groups (LBT) and another carbonyl-bridged bithiazole unit
and trifluoroacetyl terminal groups containing molecule (BBT) (Figure 1). Initially, we
synthesized the molecule and characterized according to a previously
described method.25 Both the molecules
exhibited absorbance maxima at 360 nm when dissolved in phosphate
buffer saline; phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (1×, pH = 7.4)
(Figure S1).

Figure 1 Chemical structure of
LBT and BBT.

Next, we have examined
the emission fluorescence from both LBT
and BBT. We have excited both BBT and LBT at 360 nm. Here, both the
molecules are diluted with PBS (1×, pH = 7.4) of various concentrations
like 50, 100, 200, and 400 nM. From the fluorescence intensity plot,
we observed gradual concentration-dependent increase in fluorescence
of LBT. Interestingly, BBT shows insignificant fluorescence in all
the concentrations. The quantitative estimations reveal that LBT exhibits
fivefold higher intensity as compared to BBT (Figure 2A).

Figure 2 Fluorescence emission plot of LBT and BBT at
various concentrations
(A). Comparison of experimental and theoretical absorption (B)w and
fluorescence emission (C) spectra of LBT. The Stokes shifts for experimental
and theoretical spectra are 85 and 73, respectively.

We have also studied the photophysical properties
of LBT. We found
that it is soluble in water and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). LBT exhibited
a good quantum yield of 0.1211 and 46.5% photostability up to 24 h
(Figure S2). We have also performed theoretical
calculations to understand the absorbance and emission properties
of both compounds LBT and BBT (Figure 2B,C). According to our experimental findings, we have
assumed that the intense blue fluorescence of LBT at 440 nm is due
to the probable delocalization of charge in the excited state between
the five-membered rings and the terminal carbonyl groups. After comparing
the geometries (Figures 3A and S3A) obtained from density functional
theory (DFT) and calculation of both the ground state and the excited
state of LBT, we can say that there is a significant change in the
bond length of C5–C6, C4–C5, C3–C4, C3–C2,
C2–C1, C1–C6, and C6–C11. This change in bond
lengths indicates a probable charge transfer between the five-membered
rings and the terminal carbonyl groups of LBT in the excited state.
As expected, the theoretical and experimental UV/vis and emission
spectra shown in Figure 2B,C are also in good agreement with each other.

Figure 3 Geometry-optimized excited
state of LBT (A) and BBT (B).

In the case of BBT, the probability of similar charge delocalization
between the five-membered rings and the terminal carbonyl groups is
less because of the presence of the bridging carbonyl group near to
the five-membered rings. Thus, the emission intensity of BBT is less
compared to that of LBT. As evidenced from the DFT calculations, the
change in bond lengths in the case of BBT (Figures 3B and S3B) is
less when compared to that of LBT. All the important changes in the
bond lengths of both the molecules LBT and BBT are shown in Table S1.

Furthermore, we have also shown
the electrostatic potential distribution
of the molecules (Figures S4 and 5) both in ground and excited states. Areas of high
electron abundance and low potential are marked red, whereas areas
of high potential and low electron abundance are marked as blue. As
observed from Figure S4, the yellow to
red color density around the terminal carbonyl group of BBT is less
dark (both in excited and ground state) compared to that of the same
in LBT. Thus, it is not surprising that the emission of LBT is much
more intense than that of BBT in the same region (440 nm).

As
we have observed, LBT is having characteristic fluorescence
property; hence, we next evaluated whether LBT can be used as cellular
dye or not. In the beginning, we have analyzed cellular uptake of
the LBT using a flow cytometer (Figures 4A and S6). Here,
HeLa cells were incubated with increasing concentration of LBT (10
nM, 100 nM, 1, 2, 4 and 10 μM) at 37 °C for 1 h. Then,
the cells were evaluated with a flow cytometer instrument. The result
is represented as fluorescence histogram overlay, which depicts increase
in blue fluorescence in a concentration-dependent manner with respect
to control or untreated cells. This increase in blue fluorescence
from cells indicate cellular localization of LBT.

(control) and after treatment of 1 μM of LBT (B). Scale bars

and after (LBT; 1 μM) treatment (n = 10) (C).
Data are shown as means ± standard deviation, *p < 0.001.

The result also shows
quite efficient uptake and fluorescence intensity
at nanomolar concentration of LBT. Fluorescence property and cellular
localization of LBT has made the molecule suitable for cellular dye.
Hence, the next goal is to understand its cellular organelle or site
specificity. Before this, toxicity of LBT has been analyzed using
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
assay (Figure S7A). Here, HeLa cells were
harvested in 96 wells overnight followed by treating with LBT at various
concentrations (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 μM) for 12 h. From the bar
diagram, it can be confirmed that LBT has insignificant toxicity to
cells. Further, toxicity against the cell has been analyzed by verifying
the effect of LBT on the morphology of HeLa cells (Figure S7B). Here, cells were treated with 1 μM of LBT
for 12 h. Then, cellular morphology has been analyzed under a microscope
at the DIC mode. In comparison to untreated HeLa cells, LBT shows
no characteristic changes of cellular morphology. Thus, LBT shows
no change to cellular viability and cellular structure or morphology.
Because of its nontoxic property, LBT could be used as a cell-staining
agent in combination with other molecules, inhibitors, or cytotoxic
molecules as well.

To understand specificity, we first checked
cellular localization
of LBT using a confocal microscope. Here, HeLa cells were cultured
and harvested on bottom glass cover dish followed by incubation with
LBT up to 1 h. Next, cells were washed with PBS (1×, pH = 7.4)
and fresh medium was added. Then, cells were evaluated under a microscope
in live conditions. Microscopy was carried out in DIC and blue channel
mode. Here, untreated cells were considered as control. Microscopic
images represent intense blue fluorescence staining of HeLa cells
in comparison to control where no such fluorescence has been seen.
Also, imaging in HeLa cells were performed along with BBT at 1 μM
for 1 h, but again no fluorescence was observed (Figure S8). Intriguingly, this blue fluorescence is found
to be localized at the cytoplasm near the nucleus and seems to be
like a mitochondrial body (Figure 4A). Next, we have measured intensity of blue fluorescence
from microscopic data. Here, we have observed significant increase
in fluorescence in LBT-treated cells than control (Figure 4B). Because photo-damage and
photo-bleaching are such evident problems in fluorescence microscopy,
we have performed these experiments by irradiating HeLa cells with
our dye for three and half hours and observed that till 24 h, no significant
quenching or damage occurred, proving both the stability and the noncytotoxic
nature of the dye (Figures S9 and S10).

Next, we tried to understand whether LBT is residing in mitochondria
or not. For that, we have first stained the HeLa cell with 1 μM
of LBT for 1 h, and then, cells were stained with mitotracker red
(MTRC). Here, in comparison to LBT-untreated control cell, LBT-treated
cells show higher blue fluorescence (Figures 5A,B and S11). Again, this blue fluorescence is found
to be colocalized with red fluorescence. This shows that LBT is also
found to be accumulated in mitochondria as like MTRC. We have observed
this phenomenon also through a real-time imaging as has been illustrated
through a video that shows the colocalization of the mito-tracker
with LBT over a course of 3 h and 40 min imaged at every 5 min interval
(Supporting Information Video S1). We also
observed that the mitochondrial localization of LBT slightly increases
upon treatment of the cells with stimulants like carbonyl cyanide
4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP), probably because of the
depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential (Figure S12). This has been studied through detailed analysis
of their co-localization potential represented through the intensity
correlation plot along with other important parameters (Figure S13, Table S2). Similar results also have been observed in the case of lung adenocarcinoma
cancer (A549), glioblastoma (U-87MG), and mice melanoma (B16F10) cell
lines where LBT colocalizes with mitochondria (Figure S14). From these confocal microscopic studies, it is
confirmed that LBT is a blue fluorescence-emitting mitochondria staining
agent. We have also checked the localization of BBT in lysosomes,
but unlike mitochondria, it does not show good co-localization with
a lower Pearson coefficient (0.559). This proves the specificity of
LBT for mitochondria as compared to other organelles (Figure S15).

Figure 5 Confocal microscopic images showing colocalization
of LBT with
MTRC both at lower (A) and higher (B) magnification. Pearson’s
correlation coefficient R(n) is
0.875. Scale bars correspond to 20 μm.

Further, it is interesting to note that mitochondria are
dynamic
organelles and they undergo multiple cycles of fusion and fission,
which offers mixing of key components and maintaining the number of
mitochondria.26 Mitochondria dynamicity
also represents different conditions of the cells. Thus, a mitochondria-specific
fluorescent probe could be an excellent tool for monitoring the dynamic
states of mitochondria. Hence, we have used LBT with MTRC to monitor
the different states of the mitochondrial structure such as filamentous,
bead-like or longer filamentous structure. Here, in each of the case,
we found mitochondrial localization of LBT (Figure 6A–C). Therefore, LBT can be used as
a mitochondria-specific fluorescent probe.

Figure 6 Confocal images of filamentous(A),
bead-like (B), or both (C) structures
of mitochondria. Pearson’s correlation co-efficient R(n) of the following structures are 0.908
(A), 0.829 (B), and 0.878 (C). Scale bars correspond to 20 μm.

Conclusions
In summary, we have
discovered new nontoxic bithiazole containing
a blue fluorescent mitochondrial probe (LBT), which shows photophysical
property with 360 nm/440 nm (Ex/Em) in the blue fluorescence range.
As very few blue fluorescence-emitting mitochondrial probes are available,
LBT should be a suitable option for various cell-based fluorescence
microscopy or flow cytometric analyses. Conversely, because of characteristic
fluorescence features, LBT can be used for various Förster
resonance energy transfer experiments with various fluorophores, such
as cyan fluorescent protein, FITC, and GFP. Further, microscopic images
reveal that this probe can monitor the different states of the mitochondrial
structure. Therefore, this probe can be used as a new blue fluorescent
mitotracker and has very high potential for cell biology and biochemistry
research.

Methods
Computational Analyses
Full-geometry optimizations
of the ground states were carried out using the density functional
theory (DFT) method with the Becke-3-Lee-Yang-Parr (B3LYP) exchange
functional and assigning the 6-31G** basis set. The absorbance spectra
of the ground state of the molecules are calculated by time-dependent

basis set. The emissive property of the excited states is calculated
by complete geometry optimization by TDDFT with the CAM-B3LYP exchange
functional using the 6-31G** basis set. For all the calculations,
the solvent (water) was treated implicitly using the solvent model
density model. All calculations were performed with the Gaussian ‘09
program with the help of the GaussView visualization program.27 A preliminary conformation search using Spartan
’18 has also been performed for both the molecules to choose
the correct conformer.28

Fluorometric
Analysis of LBT and BBT
Fluorescence emission
of LBT and BBT were analyzed using a fluorometer at excitation 360
nm and the emission range of 400–700 nm at various concentrations.

Cells and Cell Culture
The human cervical cancer cell
line (HeLa), lung adenocarcinoma cancer (A549), glioblastoma (U-87MG),
and mice melanoma (B16F10) cell lines were collected from National
Centre for Cell Science (NCCS) Pune, India. Then, cells were cultured
and maintained under 5% CO2 humidified incubator atmosphere
at 37 °C using DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin
(50 units/mL), streptomycin (50 μg/mL), and kanamycin sulfate
(110 mg/L). Trypsin–EDTA solution was used to digest the monolayer
cell culture.

Cell Viability Analysis
Cell viability
was performed
by MTT assay using the standardized protocol.29

Cellular Uptake and Localization of LBT
Cells (1 ×
106 cells/mL) were seeded in 6-well plates overnight. Then,
cells were detached and taken in suspension. Next, cells were incubated
with various concentrations of LBT (10 nM, 100 nM, 1, 2, 4, and 10
μM) for 1 h. Then, cells were given a PBS wash, and to it, pre-warmed
media was added and analyzed using FACS.

For microscopic analysis
of cellular uptake of LBT, HeLa cells were seeded on a glass bottom
cover dish. Then, cells were incubated with 1 μM of LBT for
1 h. The cells were given a PBS wash and was analyzed under a microscope.

For mitochondria co-localization analysis, cells were seeded on
a glass bottom cover dish overnight followed by treatment of 1 μM
of LBT for 1 h. Then, cells were given a wash and incubated with 100
nM of MTRC (MitoTracker Red CMXRos) for 45 min followed by washes
and fixation with 4% formaldehyde solution. Co-localization analysis
was conducted under a confocal microscope. In the case of stimulation
with FCCP, a mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation uncoupler, before
adding LBT, the cells were incubated with 20 nM FCCP for 1 h.

For lysosome localization analysis, cells were similarly seeded
on a glass bottom cover dish overnight, followed by treatment of 1
μM of LBT for 1 h. Then, the cells were washed and incubated
with 50 nM LysoTracker Deep Red for 30 min followed by washing and
fixation in 4% formaldehyde solution. Co-localization analysis as
usual was conducted under a confocal microscope.

Real-Time Microscopic Live
Cell Imaging
For live cell
imaging, the HeLa cells grown overnight on confocal dishes were incubated
with 100 nM of MTRC (MitoTracker Red CMXRos) for 45 min followed by
washing and treatment with 1 μM of LBT which was then monitored
for 3 h and 40 min and imaged at every 5 min in three channels (blue,
TRITC and DIC) in a 5% CO2 chamber of Tokai hit in an Olympus
IX83 microscope equipped with an Andor (iXon3) EMCCD camera.

Photostability
Experiment30
Photostability (dye
photobleaching) of LBT was measured by exposing
the dye to an incandescent light source for 24 h, and their fluorescence
at 440 nm was measured at every 4 h interval up to 24 h.

Determination
of Quantum Yield
The quantum yield was
determined according to a previously described method.31 Anthracene in ethanol (φ = 0.27) was used
as the standard for the fluorescence quantum yield calculation as
the emission of LBT is at 440 nm. In 1 cm quartz cuvettes, the fluorescence
spectra and absorbance of both LBT and anthracene were measured.

Quantum yield was determined using the following equation  φ = quantum yield, F = area under fluorescence
spectra, A = absorption
maxima, and n = refractive index.

Determination
of Photo-Damage and Photo-Bleaching
This
study has been performed following a previously described method.32 Briefly, the HeLa cells treated with 1 μM
LBT were irradiated under the blue channel of a fluorescence microscope
for 3 h and 30 min. Thereafter, the cells were monitored and imaged
at every 4 h interval in the DIC mode and blue channel for 24 h to
observe any notable photo-damage caused to the cell photo-bleaching
of the dye.

Microscope Parameter and Channel Information
All the
images were taken under similar exposure time for control and LBT-treated
cells (281.2 and 280.2 ms respectively). EM gain and gain were maintained
as value 10.0 and 1.0, respectively. Lamp intensity was 5.40. For
LBT and BBT, the excitation/emission filters are 360/440 nm; for the
MTRC channel, it is 579/599 nm, and for LysoTracker Deep Red, it is
647/668 nm (excitation and emission class both near IR).
