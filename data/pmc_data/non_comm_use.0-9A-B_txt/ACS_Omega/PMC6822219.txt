Metal-free reaction conditions featuring
oxygen and 1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene
(TBD) were employed for the selective oxidation of benzyl amines and
active methylene compounds to afford various amides and ketones. Owing
to the strong basicity of guanidine bases, TBD is presumed to play
an important role in the cleavage of the C–H bond at the benzylic
position of peroxide intermediates, which were formed by the reaction
with oxygen.

Introduction
Oxidation is a versatile
method of converting raw materials into
chemically and pharmaceutically valuable oxyfunctionalized building
blocks. Among the wide variety of oxidation processes, metal-free
aerobic oxidation is attractive owing to the sustainability and environmental
benefits of aerobic oxidation processes without transition-metal catalysts.
However, the activation of triplet oxygen without transition-metal
catalysts is challenging. To promote aerobic oxidation without transition-metal
catalysts, N-oxy radicals such as 2,2,6,6-tertramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (TEMPO) and phthalimide-N-oxy, or N-oxy radical precursors such as N-hydroxy
phthalimide have been employed.1−3 These N-oxy radicals/precursors
activate C–H bonds adjacent to amines, alcohols, thiols, and
aromatic groups to form a range of imines,4−10 nitriles,11,12 amides,13−15 and ketones
under aerobic conditions.16−20 Other than those used for N-oxy-radical-mediated
oxidation reactions, efficient and metal-free aerobic oxidation conditions
are rarely reported.

Our research group has been interested
in aerobic oxidation using
1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene (TBD), a guanidine-type base.
Owing to the resonance stabilization of its conjugate acids, TBD shows
strong basicity and nucleophilicity,21,22 resulting
in its use in various organic reactions.23−25 Previously,
we reported that the TBD-mediated oxidation of benzyl mercaptans provides
thiobenzaldehydes, which were employed in oxidative coupling with
amines, alcohols, sulfones, and phosphorus ylides in the presence
of copper catalysts (Scheme 1).26−28 Upon comparing the acidity of benzylic C(sp3)–H bonds of thiols with those of amines and
active methylene compounds, it was assumed that the C(sp3)–H bonds of amines and active methylene compounds
could be cleaved by the oxygen radicals, and resulting oxygen-incorporated
intermediate can undergo deprotonation by TBD to complete C=O
bond formation.29−31 In this study, it was found that, even in the absence
of transition-metal catalysts and chemical oxidants, TBD accelerated
the aerobic oxidation of amines and active methylene compounds to
afford the corresponding amides and ketones selectively. The scope
of this oxidation was examined, and mechanistic studies were conducted
to understand the reaction pathway.

Scheme 1 TBD-Mediated Aerobic
Oxidation
Results and Discussion
Studies on the TBD-mediated aerobic oxidation began with benzyl
amine 1a (Table 1). A reaction mixture of 1a with 1 equiv of TBD
in toluene was heated at 100 °C under 1 bar of oxygen to afford
benzamide 1b in 27% yield (entry 1). Reactions in different
solvents were examined, and the reaction in dimethyl acetamide (DMAc)
produced the highest yield of 1b (entries 1–3).
The effect of the bases was examined; 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene
(DBU) participated in the oxidation of 1a to give 1b in 38% yield (entry 4), and methyl-substituted TBD (Me-TBD)
gave a similar result to that of the reaction using TBD (entry 5).
Inorganic base KOt-Bu did not promote the desired
oxidation reaction (entry 6). Upon decreasing the amount of TBD, the
yield of 1b decreased slightly (entry 7). In the absence
of TBD, the desired amide formation was not observed, but traces of
benzaldehyde formed with unreacted starting materials left (entry
8). Pressurized conditions were also employed (entries 9 and 10);
the reaction in toluene gave a higher yield of 1b (80%),
but the reaction in DMAc did not (62%).

b O2 (8 bar). Reaction
conditions: a mixture of 1a (1.0 mmol) and TBD in the
solvent (1.0 M) was subjected to the indicated reaction conditions.

The optimal reaction conditions
in Table 1 were employed
for the oxidation of amine
derivatives (Figure 1). Fluoro- and chloro-substituted benzyl amines were successfully
converted into amides 2b and 3b in 66 and
65% yields, respectively. Methyl-substituted benzamide 4b was produced in 56% yield and piperonyl amine was converted into
the corresponding amide 5b in 51% yield. The electronic
properties of the benzene substituents seem to affect the yield; halogen-substituted
amides were produced in higher yields than amides with the electron-donating
groups. Accordingly, benzyl amines with one and two trifluoromethyl
groups were converted into the corresponding amides in similar yields
to those of 2b and 3b.

Figure 1 Aerobic oxidation of
amines and active methylene compounds.

On the basis of the successful oxidation of amines to amides, the
oxidation of active methylene compounds was examined. Fluorene was
subjected to the oxidation conditions and afforded fluorenone 8b in 81% yield. Without TBD, trace amounts of the oxidation
product were observed with unreacted starting materials left. Bromo-substituted
compounds 9b and 10b were obtained from
the corresponding reactants in 83 and 69% yields, respectively. 11H-Benzo[b]fluoren-11-one, containing more
aromatic rings, underwent oxidation to afford desired product 11b in 85% yield. An amine-substituted fluorene was converted
into 12b in 89% yield. 9H-Xanthen-9-one,
possessing an oxygen atom between benzene rings, gave the highest
yield (91%). 9,10-Dihydroanthracene underwent oxidation to generate
diketone product 14b in 62% yield.

The proposed
reaction mechanisms of the TBD-mediated oxidations
are displayed in Scheme 2. In the case of amines, three reaction routes are possible. Benzyl
amine 1a can react with O2 to generate a peroxide
intermediate, and then the α proton of the peroxide intermediate
can be abstracted by TBD to produce benzamide 1b (route
A).4,15 Alternatively, the peroxide intermediate
can eliminate H2O2 to produce an imine that
can undergo hydrolysis and oxidation by O2 or H2O2 to generate 1b (route B).10,32−34 The imine can also undergo further oxidation to afford
a benzonitrile, which can be hydrolyzed to provide 1b (route C). To probe the working mechanism, 18O-labeled
H2O was added into a mixture containing benzyl amine, resulting
in the formation of mixtures of 18O-1b and 16O-1b (Scheme 3, eq 1). According to the results of the 18O-labeling experiment, routes A and B both contribute to product
formation. A reaction involving benzonitrile under the optimal oxidation
conditions produced 1b in 26% yield (Scheme 3, eq 2), but benzonitrile was
not observed in the reaction mixture through GC and NMR analysis of
the reaction solutions. Interestingly, the addition of TEMPO did not
impede the reaction (Scheme 3, eq 3). Presumably, the reactions of amines and TEMPO induce
single-electron transfer from the amines to TEMPO, and the resulting
oxidized amines are converted into peroxide complexes in the presence
of superoxide anion radicals.7 The presence
of superoxide anion radicals was confirmed using the nitroblue tetrazolium
test.15,35 In the case of active methylene compounds,
the reaction proceeds via the formation of a peroxide intermediate
followed by the elimination of water, analogous to route A of the
amine oxidation.

Conclusions
We
report the first example of TBD-mediated aerobic oxidation of
amines and active methylene compounds. The acidities of benzylic protons
of amines and active methylene compounds allowed feasible oxidation
by gaseous oxygen followed by deprotonation by TBD. In addition to
TBD, other guanidine and amidine bases (strong organic bases) could
participate in this transformation, albeit with variations in the
yields. According to the results of this study, aerobic oxidation
of benzylamines and active methylene compounds can be promoted by
nonradical organic bases in the absence of transition-metal catalysts.
