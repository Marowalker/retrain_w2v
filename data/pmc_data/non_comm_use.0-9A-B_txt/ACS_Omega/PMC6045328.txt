A new rhodamine-based
chemosensor 1 with a six-membered
spirocyclic ring has been synthesized, which exhibits excellent pH
stability and shows selective “turn-on” fluorescent
detection of Cu2+ ions over a series of other metal ions
including Cu+ ions. The expansion of spirocycle improves
the stability and selectivity of the chemosensors in sensing of metal
ions. Till today only few rhodamine structures R1–R5 with thiourea-, hydrazine amide-, or pyrrole-decorated
six-membered spirocyclic rings are known that exhibit metal-ion sensing
via C–N bond cleavage of the spiro ring. In this context, rhodamine
compound that responds to the metal ion through C–C bond cleavage
of the six-membered spiro ring is completely unknown. The present
example is a first-time report that demonstrates selective sensing
of Cu2+ ions through C–C bond cleavage over the
conventional existing systems in the literature. The chemosensor 1 is cell permeable and can detect Cu2+ in live
cells using confocal microscopy in the biologically relevant pH range
with high photostability.

==== Body
Introduction
The design and synthesis
of fluorogenic and chromogenic probes
for selective sensing of biologically relevant metal ions have drawn
considerable attention for several years.1−7 Of the different metal ions, copper, after iron and zinc, is the
third most abundant essential trace element in the human body. It
plays a crucial role in many fundamental physiological processes in
organisms.8,9 However, under overloading conditions, copper
exhibits toxicity that causes several neurodegenerative diseases (e.g.,
Menkes syndrome, Alzheimer’s disease, Wilson’s disease,
and familial amyotropic lateral sclerosis), probably through the production
of reactive oxygen species.10,11 Therefore, it is essential
to maintain the balance of copper ion in the body. Owing to such different
features of copper ion in the biological system, it is desirable to
develop selective fluorescent and colorimetric sensors of Cu2+ ions.

Fluorescent sensors deserve attention due to high sensitivity
and
spatial resolution in combination with being nondestructive to the
samples and less cell damaging in microscopy. In pursuing the sensors
of this class, exploitation of rhodamine probes that show excellent
photophysical properties12 and ion-induced
facile five-membered lactam ring opening accompanying a color change
from colorless to pink color, is worth mentioning.

The literature
reveals that numerous rhodamine-based Cu2+ probes contain
five-membered spirolactam rings with appropriate
binding groups that participate in metal-ion binding involving amide
ion through the ring opening and result in color and fluorescence
changes.13−24 In many cases, the probes of this kind are pH sensitive too. In
this capacity, metal-ion sensing using six-membered spirolactam-based
rhodamine sensors is almost unexplored. The expansion of spirocycle
improves the stability and selectivity of the chemosensors in sensing
of metal ions. Only four kinds of examples are known till today where
either the thiourea (R1 and R2),25,26 hydrazine amide (R3)27 or
the pyrrole-based (R4 and R5)28 six-membered spiro rings are involved in sensing
of bio-relevant metal ions such as Cu2+ and Hg2+ by ensuing the cleavage of the C–N bond in the spirocycle
(Chart 1). In this
context, the existing five-membered rhodamine chemosensors are also
known to interplay via C–N bond cleavage. Therefore, structural
modification related to stability, sensitivity, and selectivity is
desirable.

Chart 1 Reported and Present Six-Membered Rhodamine Chemosensors
for Metal-Ion
Sensing
In continuation of
our work on rhodamine sensors,29−35 we wish to report in this full account the design, synthesis, and
metal-ion sensing behavior of a new six-membered spirocycle-based
rhodamine compound 1. In comparison to the existing six-membered
spirocycles25−28 (Chart 1), the present
chemosensor 1 contains amide functionality in the spirocycle
and has been proven to be photostable and pH-insensitive. Further,
it has been established, for the first time, as an excellent chemosensor
for selective sensing of Cu2+ ions involving C–C
bond cleavage of the spiro ring. Importantly, organic transformation
involving C–C bond cleavage followed by its activation through
several ways is an attractive issue in organic synthesis.36 This is a challenging aspect in spite of the
inertness of the C–C bond. In many organometallic reactions
for organic synthesis, the C–C bond activation (cleavage) is
usually thermodynamically less favored than the C–C bond formation
due to formation of weak metal–carbon bonds at the expense
of a relatively stable C–C bond (90 kcal mol–1).37 To make the C–C bond cleavage
facile, several strategies which are well explained in several reviews36 are followed. Of the different strategies, formation
of a stable metal complex resulting from C–C bond cleavage
is unique.

In addition, the compound 1 is useful
for cell imaging
and the complex of 1 with Cu2+ ion detects
S2– ions selectively over a series of other anions.
Sulfide ion is known to react with Cu2+ ion to form a stable
CuS species, which has a low-solubility product constant ksp = 6.3 × 10–36. Therefore, among
various approaches to sensing sulfide anions, sensors exploiting copper
sulfide affinity38,39 attract attention.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
The six-membered spirocyclic compound 1 was achieved
according to Scheme 1. The Boc-protected benzimidazole 2, obtained from our
reported procedure,35,40,41 was used for methylation of both the ring
and aliphatic amino nitrogens using CH3I in dry tetrahydrofuran
(THF) to afford the compound 3.42 Removal of the Boc-group in 3 using trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA) gave the amine 4, which on reaction with rhodamine
B acid chloride in the presence of Et3N yielded the desired
six-membered spirocyclic compound 1 possibly through
the simple reaction mechanistic pathway, as shown in Scheme 1. Compound 1 was
fully characterized by usual spectroscopic methods.

(i) CH3I, NaH, Dry THF, 2 h; (ii)

Interaction Study
Metal-ion sensing properties of the
new chemosensor 1 toward the perchlorate salts of metal
ions, such as Ag+, Na+, Cu+, Ca2+, Co2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Mg2+, Hg2+, Mn2+, Pb2+, Zn2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Al3+, and Cr3+ were evaluated in CH3CN/H2O (CH3CN/H2O = 4:1, v/v, 10 mM tris
HCl buffer, pH 6.5). In absence of metal ions, the chemosensor 1 is colorless and nonfluorescent, indicating the predominant
existence of the spirocyclic form in the compound. Upon excitation
at 510 nm, the chemosensor 1 gave strong emission at
∼595 nm [quantum yield43,44 (Φ): 0.58] in
the presence of varying concentrations of Cu2+ ions, accompanying
a color change from colorless to pink. Under identical conditions,
other metal ions in the study brought insignificant change in emission
spectra (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Figure 1a, in this regard,
represents the emission titration spectra of 1 with Cu2+ ions, and upon progression of titration, the colorless solution
of 1 became pink. Figure 1b displays the selective fluorescence enhancement of 1 only in the presence of Cu2+ ions over various
other metal ions including Cu+ ion taken in the study,
indicating that compound 1 is highly selective to Cu2+ ion.

Figure 1 (a) Fluorescence titration spectra of 1 (c = 2.5 × 10–5 M) in CH3CN/H2O (4/1, v/v; 10 mM tris HCl buffer; pH 6.5) upon
successive
addition of Cu2+ (c = 1 × 10–3 M) [inset: emission of 1 at 595 nm as
a function of Cu2+ concentration and color change of the
solution of 1 under illumination of UV light] and (b)

cations (6.5 equiv) (λexc = 510 nm, slit = 2/2).

The gradual addition of Cu2+ ions to the solution of 1 brought about a marked
change in the absorption spectra
(Figure 2). Importantly,
although the absorbance at 267 nm was increased to a negligible extent,
the new absorbance at 565 nm (ε/ε0 = 825, ε
= 3.3 × 104 M–1 cm–1) emerged with significant intensity, resulting in pink coloration
of the receptor solution. The other metal ions including Cu+ ion used in this study were silent in bringing such changes (Figure S2, Supporting Information).

titration spectra of 1 (c = 2.5 ×
10–5 M) in CH3CN/H2O (4/1,

of Cu2+ (c = 1 × 10–3 M) [inset: absorbance of 1 at 565 nm as a function
Cu2+ concentration and color change upon addition of Cu2+ ion].

The appearance of the
peaks at 565 nm in UV–vis absorption
and 595 nm in emission spectra are attributed to the six-membered
spiro ring opening in 1 to form a metal complex. In this
regard, the possible structure of the copper complex can be either 1A or 1B, shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Possible structures of 1–Cu2+ complex.

To be acquainted with
the actual structure of the metal complex,
we tried to grow single crystals of the Cu complex, but we failed.
Therefore, we followed density functional theory (DFT)45 calculations using B3LYP function and 6-31G
basis set. The DFT optimization of 1 and all of its possible
metal complex structures 1A and 1B was performed
in CH3CN (Figure 4). In the structure 1, the planes of the spiro
ring and xanthene ring are almost perpendicular to each other for
facile opening of the ring in the presence of the metal ion to attain
either 1A or 1B complex. Although in 1A, the amide oxygen and the benzimidazole nitrogen participate
in chelation of Cu2+ ion, in 1B the benzimidazole
nitrogen and the amide nitrogen are involved in metal chelation. DFT
optimizations of these two possible forms were done in CH3CN and the structure 1B was observed to be higher in
energy than 1A by 1.54 kcal mol–1.
Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations were
performed on each suggested complex. In the case of structure 1A, the theoretically found absorption at 555 nm with oscillator
strength f = 1.1757 matched almost with the experimentally
observed absorption (Figure 4). In comparison, under identical conditions, complex 1B gave absorption theoretically at 603 nm (Figure 4) with oscillator strength f = 0.6135, which did not match with the experimental observation.
This, therefore, ruled out the possibility of formation of the complex
structure 1B.

Figure 4 DFT-optimized structures of 1 and
its copper complexes 1A (a = 1.92, b = 1.95,
and c = 2.02 in Å) and 1B (a = 2.20 and b = 1.93 in Å). The associated
absorption spectra of Cu complexes, determined by TDDFT calculation,
are also shown.

Further, to support the
proposed binding structure of 1 with Cu2+ ions,
we recorded the Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) and 1H NMR of 1 in the presence and
absence of Cu2+ ions. In FTIR, the amide carbonyl stretching
appeared as doublet at 1654 and 1632 cm–1 and underwent
change and merged to the signal 1647 cm–1 upon complexation
of Cu2+ (Figure 5A). Furthermore, the stretching for C=N of benzimidazole35 at 1614 cm–1 was reduced to
1590 cm–1, which clearly indicated the participation
of the imine bond (C=N) in complexation of Cu2+.

Figure 5 (A) Partial
FTIR spectra of 1 and 1–Cu2+ complex and (B) 1H NMR (CD3CN, 400
MHz) of (i) 1 (c = 1.17 × 10–2 M), (ii) 1 with 1 equiv amount of Cu(ClO4)2.

1H NMR spectra of the compound 1 in
the
absence and presence of Cu2+ ions (although paramagnetic)
were recorded in CD3CN (Figure 5B). In the presence of 1 equiv amount of
Cu(ClO4)2, the disappearance of the signal for
the assigned proton Ha at 4.84 ppm confirmed the opening
of the spirolactam ring through C–C bond cleavage. The exact
location of the signal for Ha was difficult to identify
due to the broadening nature of the spectra. During complexation,
the signals in 1H NMR became broad and some aromatic protons
moved to the downfield region. Additionally, the signals for CH3 groups of benzimidazole and spiro rings that appeared at
2.90 and 2.63 ppm also moved to the downfield directions by 0.16 and
0.09 ppm, respectively.

In the interaction process, the stoichiometry
of the Cu2+ complex was determined to be 1:1, as confirmed
by Job’s plot46 (Figure S3, Supporting
Information). The binding constant from nonlinear fit47 of the emission titration data gave a value of (1.25 ±
0.019) × 104 M–1 (Figure S4, Supporting Information). Because of poor change
in emission, binding constant values for other ions were difficult
to determine. Moreover, the detection limit48 of Cu2+ for 1 was calculated from the calibration
curve using the equation 3σ/S, where σ
is the standard deviation of the blank solution and S is the slope of the calibration curve, and the value was noted to
be 5.54 × 10–7 M (Figure S5, Supporting Information).

In the selectivity study,
the change in emission of 1 was observed in the presence
and absence of other metal ions. No
metal ion in the study interfered in the binding of Cu2+ (Figure S6, Supporting Information).
This is in contrast to the observation of Wang et al.,26 where the selective detection of Cu2+ by six-membered spirocycle rhodamine R2 was interfered
largely by Ag+ and Hg2+ ions. To understand
the sensitivity of 1 to Cu2+, we further explored
the fluorescence titration experiments of 1 with Cu2+ and other tested metal ions in pure CH3CN and
CH3CN containing different proportions of water (e.g.,
CH3CN/H2O = 1:1 and 1:5, v/v). As can be seen
from Figures S7 and S8, the chemosensor 1 reserves its selectivity for Cu2+ ion by showing
a slight variation in sensitivity. On increasing the amount of water
in CH3CN the sensitivity decreases slightly. The time-dependent
fluorescence of the sensor in the presence of Cu2+ ions
in Figure 6 represents
that the reaction of 1 with Cu2+ ions in aqueous
CH3CN is slow compared with the case in CH3CN,
evident from the slow change in emission of the sensor. In pure CH3CN, the reaction of 1 with Cu2+ is
rapid and completed within 5 min, after which the fluorescence intensity
changes scarcely.

Figure 6 Time course for the fluorescence response of 1 upon
addition of Cu2+ in different solvent systems.

As rhodamine-based compounds are responsive to
H+ also,
we evaluated the effect of pH on the absorbance and emission of 1 without or with 6.5 equiv amount of Cu2+ ions
(Figure 7). The results
indicate that the chemosensor 1 has no absorbance as
well as emission in a wide range of pH 4–12. Only at pHs 2
and 3, a small change in absorption as well as emission was observed
but the solution remained colorless (Figure S9, Supporting Information). This indicates the intactness of the six-membered
spirolactam ring of 1 even in strongly acidic condition.
On addition of Cu2+ to the solution of 1 at
different pHs, dramatic enhancement of absorbance and emission was
observed in the pH range 3–7 and the colorless rhodamine solution
became pink (Figure S9, Supporting Information).
So the chemosensor 1 was fairly applicable in a reasonable
pH range.

Figure 7 Responses of 1 and 1–Cu2+ solutions in (a) UV–vis (absorption at 565 nm) and (b) fluorescence
(emission at 596 nm) at different pHs in CH3CN/H2O (4/1, v/v; 10 mM tris HCl buffer).

Next, the usefulness of the colored copper complex of 1 was explored in anion sensing in details. Among various
anions,
only S2– responded by exhibiting a marked change
in absorption as well as in emission. In both cases, the intensity
dropped near to zero (Figure 8) and the pink solution of 1–Cu2+ complex became light yellow (Figure S10, Supporting Information). This change in color and optical spectra
is attributed to the demetallation followed by generation of the spirocyclic
ring. Importantly, this spirocyclic ring was not the six-member-based
compound 1, instead it was established as five-membered
spirocycle 1C(49) (confirmed
by 1H NMR and mass analysis, Figure S11, Supporting Information). Further addition of excess Cu2+ ions to the decomplexed solution did not produce any change
in absorption and emission as well as in color. To our opinion, after
decomplexation of Cu2+, S2–-induced elimination
afforded stable amide ion 1C′ that participated
in the cyclization reaction to furnish five-membered rhodamine-based
compound 1C,49 which is insensitive
to Cu2+ ions (Figure 9).

Figure 8 Changes in (a) absorbance and (b) emission of 1–Cu2+ complex in CH3CN/H2O (4/1, v/v; 10
mM tris HCl buffer; pH 6.5) upon addition of different guests (c = 2 × 10–3 M).

Figure 9 S2–-induced cyclization reaction of 1–Cu2+ complex.

To confirm the insensitivity of 1C toward Cu2+ ions, UV–vis and emission titrations of 1C(49) as isolated from the reaction mixture,
were
conducted under similar conditions with Cu2+ ions in CH3CN/H2O (CH3CN/H2O = 4:1,
v/v, 10 mM tris HCl buffer, pH 6.5). No significant spectral changes
were observed (Figure S12, Supporting Information).

In anticipation of anion sensing of the copper complex of 1, as depicted in Figure 8, the sensing properties of the compound 1 itself toward several common ions and reactive sulfur species were
examined (Figure S13, Supporting Information).
Importantly, the compound 1 did not show any measurable
interaction.

Biological Study
Next, the utility
of 1 to detect Cu2+ in live cells was investigated.
We labeled
HeLa cells with 3 μM of 1 for 30 min (Figure 10). Live cell imaging
was carried out in a chamber while maintaining temperature (37 °C),
humidity (90%), and CO2 concentration (5%). The confocal
microscopy image of the 1-labeled HeLa cells showed weak
fluorescence, which may reflect the low content of Cu2+ in the basal level (Figure 10a–c).50 On the other hand,
the fluorescence intensity was dramatically increased by pretreatment
of Cu2+ (200 μM) for 30 min (Figure 10d–f).

Figure 10 Confocal microscope
images of HeLa cells labeled with 3.0 μM
of 1. Images were captured (a) before and (d) after treatment
with 200 μM CuCl2 and (g) after addition of 40 mM
Na2S to image (d) for 30 min at 37 °C. (b), (e), (h)
are bright-field images. (c), (f), (i) are merged images of (a), (d),
(g) and (b), (e), (h), respectively. Cells shown are representative
images from replicate experiments (n = 5). Images
were collected using 525 nm excitation and emission windows at 550–700
nm. Scale bar: 40 μm.

Moreover, the fluorescence intensity at a given region in
the 1-labeled HeLa cells was maintained nearly the same
after
continuous irradiation of the 525 nm excitation for 1 h. This outcome
indicated the high photostability of 1 in the cell imaging
condition (Figure 11). These data demonstrated that 1 is capable of detecting
Cu2+ ions in live cells with good cell permeability and
brightness and minimum interference of photoinstability. To confirm
that the chemosensor 1 could not affect the viability
of HeLa cells in our incubation condition, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide assay (Cell Titer 96H; Promega, Maidson, Wisconsin) was used
according to the manufacture’s protocol (Figure S14, Supporting Information).

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have synthesized six-membered
spirocyclic fluorescent
chemosensor 1 that selectively sensed Cu2+ over a series of other metal ions and discriminated Cu2+ from Cu+ ion effectively. The six-membered spiro ring
opening in the presence of Cu2+ proceeded through C–C
bond cleavage. This is in comparison to the reported six-membered
(R1–R5)25−28 and other five-membered rhodamine
compounds13−24,29−35,51−57 where complexation of a selective metal ion takes place through
C–N bond cleavage (Table S1). The
present example is thus a first-time report that demonstrates selective
sensing of Cu2+ ions through C–C bond cleavage over
the conventional existing systems in the literature (Table S2). The sensor is extremely pH stable and works well
in both organic and aqueous organic solvents for Cu2+ with
good detection limit without facing any interference of other ions
examined.

The chemosensor 1 is cell permeable and
can detect
Cu2+ in live cells using confocal microscopy in the biologically
relevant pH range with high photostability. The complex of 1 with Cu2+ ion additionally detects S2– ions selectively over a series of other anions. Such six-membered
spiro ring-based pH-insensitive rhodamine is new addendum to the existing
reports, shown in Chart 1. Structural tuning of this new rhodamine derivative is underway
in the laboratory.

evaporated in vacuo to give rhodamine B acid chloride, which was directly
used in the next step. The crude acid chloride was dissolved in the
dry dichloromethane (20 mL) and was added dropwise for 10 min to a

Synthesis of
Compound 1C(49)
To
a stirred solution of 1 (0.01 g, 0.016
mmol) in CH3CN/H2O (4:1, v/v) (10 mL), Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (0.005 g, 0.02 mmol) was
added and stirred for 5 min. Then, Na2S (0.008 g, 0.03
mmol) was added to the 1–Cu2+ complex
solution and stirred for another 15 min; solvent was then removed
under vacuuo, and the reaction mixture was then extracted with ethyl
acetate (15 mL). The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over
Na2SO4, and evaporated under reduced pressure.

Quantum
Yield Determination
Quantum yield of the compound 1 in presence of Cu2+ was determined in CH3CN
by the relative comparison procedure using rhodamine B
as the standard (φrhB = 0.68 in ethanol).43 The general equation used in the determination
of relative quantum yields is as follows44  where
Φ is the quantum yields, F is the integrated
area under the corrected emission spectrum, A is
the absorbance at the excitation wavelength, λex is
the excitation wavelength, η is the refractive
index of the solution, and the subscripts “u” and “s”
refer to the unknown and the standard, respectively.

Theoretical
Calculation
Structures of compound 1 and its
complexes 1A and 1B were
optimized in acetonitrile. TDDFT calculations were carried out on 1A and 1B using the same level of theory with
the polarizable continuum model in acetonitrile (ε = 35.688).
All of the calculations have been performed with Gaussian 09 suite
of program.41

General Procedure for Fluorescence
and UV–Vis Titrations
Stock solution of the compound 1 was prepared in CH3CN/H2O (4/1, v/v;
10 mM tris HCl buffer; pH 6.5)
mixture solvent in the concentration of 2.5 × 10–5 M. Stock solutions of guests were also prepared in same solvent
in the concentration of 1 × 10–3 M. Solution
of compound 1 (2 mL) was taken in the cuvette and to
this solution different guests were individually added in different
amounts. Upon addition of guests, the change in emission of the compound
was recorded. The same stock solutions were used to perform the UV–vis
titration experiment in the same way.

Method for Job Plot46
The
stoichiometry was determined by the continuous variation method (Job
plot). In this method, solutions of host (compound 1)
and guest (Cu2+) of equal concentrations were prepared
in CH3CN/H2O (4/1, v/v; 10 mM tris HCl buffer;
pH 6.5) solvent. Then, the solutions of compound 1 and
Cu2+ were mixed in different proportions, maintaining a
total volume of 3 mL of the mixture. The related compositions for
host/guest (v/v) were 3:0, 2.75:0.25; 2.5:0.5, 2.25:0.75, 2:1, 1.75:1.25,
1.5:1.5, 1:2, 0.75:2.25, 0.5:2.5, and 0.25:2.75. All of the prepared
solutions were kept for 1 h, with occasional shaking at room temperature.
Then, fluorescence and absorbance of the solutions of different compositions
were recorded. The concentration of the complex, i.e., [HG] was calculated
using the equation [HG] = ΔI/I0 × [H] or [HG] = ΔA/A0 × [H], where ΔI/I0 and ΔA/A0 indicate the relative emission and absorbance
intensities, respectively. [H] corresponds to the concentration of
the pure host. The mole fraction of the host (XH) was plotted
against concentration of the complex [HG]. In the plot, the mole fraction
of the host at which the concentration of the host–guest complex
concentration [HG] is maximum, gives the stoichiometry of the complex.
