The clinical success
of Escherichia colil-asparaginase
II (EcAII) as a front line chemotherapeutic
agent for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is often compromised
because of its silent inactivation by neutralizing antibodies. Timely
detection of silent immune response can rely on immobilizing EcAII,
to capture and detect anti-EcAII antibodies. Having recently reported
the use of a portable surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensing device
to detect anti-EcAII antibodies in undiluted serum from children undergoing
therapy for ALL (Aubé et al., ACS Sensors2016, 1 (11), 1358–1365), here we
investigate the impact of the quaternary structure and the mode of
immobilization of EcAII onto low-fouling SPR sensor chips on the sensitivity
and reproducibility of immunosensing. We show that the native tetrameric
structure of EcAII, while being essential for activity, is not required
for antibody recognition because monomeric EcAII is equally antigenic.
By modulating the mode of immobilization, we observed that low-density
surface coverage obtained upon covalent immobilization allowed each
tetrameric EcAII to bind up to two antibody molecules, whereas high-density
surface coverage arising from metal chelation by N- or C-terminal
histidine-tag reduced the sensing efficiency to less than one antibody
molecule per tetramer. Nonetheless, immobilization of EcAII by metal
chelation procured up to 10-fold greater surface coverage, thus resulting
in increased SPR sensitivity and allowing reliable detection of lower
analyte concentrations. Importantly, only metal chelation achieved
highly reproducible immobilization of EcAII, providing the sensing
reproducibility that is required for plasmonic sensing in clinical
samples. This report sheds light on the impact of multiple factors
that need to be considered to optimize the practical applications
of plasmonic sensors.

Introduction
The E. colil-asparaginase
II (EcAII) isozyme hydrolyses l-Asn into l-Asp with
a high catalytic efficiency. It is a critical component of chemotherapy
for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and has been in the
World Health Organization’s list of essential medicines since
1995.1−3 However, its use may be compromised by allergic reactions,
overt or silent.4−6 The main concern relative to the silent hypersensitivity
that occurs in 5–46% of patients is the development of neutralizing
antibodies that result in silent inactivation of EcAII, thus reducing
treatment efficacy.6−11 As a counterpart to its therapeutic use, EcAII is also used to capture
and thus detect anti-EcAII antibodies in patients.12,13 The crystal structure of native EcAII has been resolved in different
space groups, free or complexed, and for several mutants, revealing
a highly packed homotetrameric structure exhibiting four identical
active sites formed by complementation of the so-called intimate homodimers.1,14 Several antigenic determinants of EcAII have been identified, including
a dominant B-cell conformational epitope. However, little is known
about the antigenicity of EcAII in an immobilized form, which is an
essential aspect for immunosensing purposes.15

We recently reported the application of a portable immunosensing
device based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to detect anti-EcAII
antibodies in undiluted serum from children undergoing therapy for ALL (Aubé
et al., 2016). We strive to work directly with complex biological
media to reduce the impact that the sample pretreatment may have on
the analyte and to reduce the time of analysis. Several challenges
were encountered during that study, the principal of which was poor
and/or irreproducible surface immobilization of the native EcAII antigen.
Here, we report a detailed examination of the mode of presentation
of EcAII on SPR sensor chips to identify the immobilization chemistry
eliciting optimal immunosensing properties.12,16−20 Indeed, the mode of surface immobilization may preclude efficient
antibody recognition if the binding site (epitope) or the surrounding
regions are partly masked in the ensemble of EcAII molecules.17,21 Furthermore, alterations in the quaternary structure upon immobilization
could affect its antigenicity, where conformation or subunit assembly
is essential, reducing the SPR response.

To this effect, we
compared heterogeneous surface immobilization
of native EcAII by covalent cross-linking via its surface-exposed
lysine residues and homogeneous surface immobilization by coordination
of N- or C-terminal histidine (His)-tags. The quaternary structure,
the activity, and the antigenicity of native EcAII and EcAII bearing
N- or C-terminal 6-His-tags were compared before and after surface
immobilization. We then validated those results in the context of
SPR immunosensing in serum. This analytical method has many advantages
over the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that is commonly
used for the clinical monitoring of anti-EcAII antibodies. Indeed,
SPR immunosensing can offer real-time, label-free, and on-site detection
and quantification of antibodies. Using low-fouling self-assembled
monolayer (SAM) surface technology to reduce nonspecific interactions,
we assessed the sensitivity of antibody sensing by SPR in undiluted
serum.22 Changes to the quaternary structure
had little influence on the receptor antigenicity. Although the His-tagged
EcAII displayed lower sensing efficiency than the native EcAII, it
provided increased surface coverage and reproducibility of immobilization,
ultimately procuring significantly increased immunodetection sensitivity.
These results shed light on the challenges encountered in our recently
reported detection of serum anti-asparaginase antibodies in the sera
of children undergoing chemotherapy23 and
the challenges expected to be encountered by others developing sensors
to monitor the immunogenic response of patients undergoing therapy
with biologic-type drugs.

Results and Discussion
EcAII functions
as a tetramer, where the intimate homodimers further
dimerize to form the functional homotetramer.1,24−28 Among the many characterized linear T- and B-cell epitopes, a dominant
conformational B-cell epitope has been identified on EcAII. This conformational
epitope, present four times on EcAII, is formed by four different
immunogenic segments clustered around the entrance of each of the
four identical active sites and may be the principal target for neutralizing
antibodies and silent inactivation15,29−31 (Figure 1A,B).

determinants forming a dominant B-cell conformational epitope (residues
15–26, 53–58, 253–257, and 283–289) that
may constitute a target for neutralizing antibodies are shown in orange
surfaces.15 The N- and C-termini used for

cross-linking are colored according to the legend. (B) Intimate dimer

one subunit complemented by E283 from a second subunit (right).27 The complexed l-Asp is in cyan. (C)
Native and C8-EcAII precursor proteins harbor a signal sequence (22
residues) for periplasmic expression (black). Scissors indicate the
cleavage site. Variants N21-EcAII and N26-EcAII have N-terminal His-tags
(20 residues, in green; 25 residues, in blue), whereas C8-EcAII has
a C-terminal His-tag (8 residues, in red).

Toward the goal of capturing anti-EcAII antibodies, the EcAII
protein
was surface-immobilized to act as a receptor. Its numerous surface-exposed
lysine residues (approximately 76) make it possible to undertake covalent,
randomly oriented immobilization onto gold-coated SPR sensor chips.
In parallel, we developed several His-tagged EcAII variants to allow
oriented immobilization by coordination with surface-immobilized nitrilotriacetic
acid (NTA)-cobalt (Co)-functionalized antifouling peptides (Figure 1C).

In addition
to its functional tetrameric form, EcAII forms alternative
oligomeric states in solution as a function of protein preparation
and storage conditions.32−35 Commercial preparations may contain up to 20% monomer
and higher multimerization states (octamer and dodecamer, among others)
that are less active than the tetramer.36 Higher-state oligomers may present different antigenic determinants.
Because modifying the protein sequence may alter the oligomerization
state and thus alter immunogenicity, we investigated the quaternary
structure of the His-tagged forms of EcAII.

Recombinant N- and
C-terminally His-tagged forms of EcAII (N21-,
N26- and C8-EcAII) were named after the length of the fused tags that
added 21 and 26 residues at the N-terminus or 8 residues at the C-terminus
(Figures 1C and S1). Replacement of the N-terminal signal peptide
by the N-terminal His-tags led to lower yields of soluble proteins
(9–15 and 1–16 mg L–1 of N21- and
N26-EcAII culture, respectively) relative to the periplasmic overexpression
of C8-EcAII (60–80 mg L–1 of culture), despite
the overall expression levels being similar as observed using sodium
dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (results
not shown). This is consistent with the expected toxicity of cytosolic
EcAII, in accordance with the 3 orders of magnitude difference in
affinity for l-Asn between the constitutive cytosolic EcAI
(KM = 3.5 mM) and the periplasmic EcAII
(KM = 10 μM) isoforms.37 Each His-tagged EcAII was purified to ≥90%
homogeneity, mostly in the tetrameric form (Figure 2). Accurate mass determination using liquid
chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) confirmed the
expected molecular weight (MW) for the commercial Kidrolase (native
EcAII) and for the processed C8-EcAII (native signal peptide cleaved)
and revealed processing of the N-terminal methionine for both N21-
and N26-EcAII, which contained 20 and 25 additional N-terminal residues,
respectively (Table S2).

or 12.5 μg (d) of each protein. Proteins were stored at −80
°C with or without glycerol (GOH) and prepared with or without
6-aminocaproic acid (6-ACA) in the loading dye. Aggregates (A) are
indicated for N21-EcAII.

The activity of the EcAII variants, both in solution and
immobilized
on the sensor chips, was monitored using the coupled reaction with
glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and by measuring concomitant reduced
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidation.38,39 The activity of EcAII variants in solution was confirmed by measuring
the ammonia produced using direct Nesslerization.40 The apparent specific activity of all purified His-tagged
EcAII variants was 3 to 4-fold lower than that of native EcAII (Kidrolase)
freshly reconstituted from lyophilized powder (Figure 2B and Table 1). Flash-freezing of reconstituted Kidrolase and storage
at −80 °C resulted in 30% loss of activity, whereas
both N-terminally tagged EcAII retained 94–100% of their activity
upon storage (Figure S2). By contrast,
the C-terminally tagged C8-EcAII was essentially inactivated upon
flash-freezing/thawing. For this reason, it was stored at 4 °C
where it showed high stability (>90% activity after 1 year). These
results demonstrate that all EcAII variants adopt a fold compatible
with catalytic activity, suggesting that they assemble as tetramers.

The maintenance of native tetrameric quaternary structure
might
be an advantage when using EcAII as a receptor for antibody capture,
according to the report of a dominant conformational B-cell epitope15 (Figure 1). The commercial EcAII preparation (Kidrolase) was mainly
tetrameric in solution according to analytical size exclusion chromatography
(SEC; expected MW 138.4 kDa; observed MW ≈ 120 kDa) (Figure 2A). It also included
traces of octamer (expected MW 276.8 kDa; observed MW ≈ 315
kDa) and dodecamer (expected MW 415 kDa; observed MW ≈ 456
kDa) but no detectable monomer. The proportion of tetramer in the
native EcAII decreased from 99 to 90% with a concomitant increase
in the octameric form upon increasing the protein concentration (0.1–5
mg mL–1), consistent with previous reports33,34,41 (Figure 2A, Tables S3 and S4). Electrophoresis under native conditions [clear native (CN)- and
blue native (BN)-PAGE] further confirmed that freshly reconstituted,
native EcAII occurs principally as a tetramer, with some octamer and
dodecamer and traces of higher state oligomers.

As for native
EcAII, freshly isolated N21-, N26-, and C8-EcAII
were all predominantly tetrameric in solution (SEC, data not shown).
Although N26-EcAII remained predominantly tetrameric after storage
at −80 °C, consistent with its activity, N21-EcAII showed
a marked increase in octamer and dodecamer and tended to aggregate
over long-term storage. Storage in 15% glycerol (GOH) stabilized the
tetrameric form of N21-EcAII (Figure 2C,E). The tendency of N21-EcAII to form higher-state
oligomers was also observed on CN-PAGE, whereas N26-EcAII remained
mainly tetrameric. By contrast, the C-terminally tagged C8-EcAII mostly
dissociated into monomers after flash-freezing/thawing and did not
reassociate in solution over time, consistent with its loss of activity
(Figure 2B,C,E). However,
C8-EcAII stored at 4 °C was mainly tetrameric according to SEC
though it appeared roughly 50% dissociated into monomer on BN-PAGE.
Interestingly, monomeric C8-EcAII appeared to undergo reassociation
into tetramer and octamer during the course of CN-PAGE and appeared
similar to freshly isolated C8-EcAII. Reassociation was not observed
under any other condition, including BN-PAGE (Figure 2E). Thus, a variety of conditions maintain
the monomeric form of the dissociated C8-EcAII, including the lengthy
SEC at 4 °C, activity assays at 37 °C over 10 min, and BN-PAGE
in the presence of Coomassie blue G-250, whereas CN-PAGE promoted
full reassociation of monomeric C8-EcAII into nativelike oligomeric
forms. Although we did not further investigate the specific factors
that promote this reassociation, we have identified conditions where
each N- and C-terminally tagged EcAII is tetrameric and active upon
storage and conditions where C8-EcAII is maintained in an inactive,
monomeric form.

The far-ultraviolet circular dichroism (UV CD)
spectra of all EcAII
variants were consistent with well-folded α/β proteins
(Figure S3). The minima for α-helices
differed somewhat for N-terminally tagged EcAII ([Θ]222nm < [Θ]208nm) relative to native and C8-EcAII
([Θ]222nm > [Θ]208nm). This likely
reflects the contribution of their N-terminal extensions but may also
result from their cytosolic expressions. Interestingly, the CD spectrum
of monomeric C8-EcAII is nearly identical to native tetrameric EcAII
and tetrameric C8-EcAII, indicating that the secondary structure is
maintained upon dissociating into a monomer.

Intrinsic fluorescence
revealed a similar packing of aromatic residues
for all tetrameric EcAII variants (λmaxem = 320nm).42 By contrast, monomeric C8-EcAII displayed increased solvent exposure
of aromatic residues (λmaxem = 330nm), consistent with altered packing
that may result either from subunit dissociation or from changes in
the tertiary structure. The latter is supported by the lack of reassociation
into a tetramer (Figures 2B,C and S4). Thermal denaturation
revealed a cooperative and apparent two-state denaturation profile
for native and N-terminally tagged EcAII, with Tm consistent with CD-derived Tm values reported for native EcAII43,44 (Table 1 and Figure S4). A more complex unfolding profile was observed
for tetrameric C8-EcAII (more than one transition), precluding the
determination of Tm. No transition was
seen for monomeric C8-EcAII (Figure S4).
Upon refolding, native and N-terminally tagged EcAII recovered 75–80%
of the initial fluorescence intensity. Interestingly, this was accompanied
by a 7 nm red shift (λmax = 327 nm), similar to monomeric
C8-EcAII before thermal denaturation (λmax = 330
nm) (Figure S5), suggesting refolding into
monomers. Overall, the N-terminally His-tagged EcAII variants show
association and folding properties more similar to native EcAII than
the C-terminally tagged EcAII.

To verify if the quaternary structure,
the His-tag at the N- or
C-terminus or the immobilization mode of EcAII (random or oriented)
modulate the sensing properties for detecting the anti-EcAII antibodies,
antigenicity was analyzed using ELISA.12 Titration of polyclonal rabbit IgG was determined with the EcAII
variants randomly adsorbed on a surface that binds both the hydrophilic
and hydrophobic regions of proteins (MaxiSorp) or with His-tagged
EcAII variants immobilized in an oriented manner via Ni-NTA coordination
(Figure S6). Development was performed
under conditions of high, intermediate, and low sensitivity by modulating
the concentration of H2O2. In each case, the
dynamic range of the binding assay spanned 2 orders of magnitude and
was similar for all forms of EcAII (Figure S7 and Table S5). The apparent dissociation
constant (KD) ranged from 10–26
ng mL–1 (∼100–160 pM) under high sensitivity
conditions, 120–260 ng mL–1 (∼0.7–1.7
nM) at intermediate sensitivity, and 0.75–1.5 μg mL–1 (∼5–10 nM) at low sensitivity (Tables S5 and S6). Monomeric C8-EcAII showed
a slightly lower antigenicity (higher KD) than tetrameric EcAII variants; among the tetrameric variants,
both N-terminally tagged EcAII showed slightly higher antigenicity
(lower KD) than the native form (P = 0.0001). Antibody titration with His-tagged EcAII oriented
on Ni-NTA-coated plates gave a 1.5- to 2.5-fold higher KD than for randomly oriented immobilization, indicating
less efficient antibody recognition (Figure 3 and Table 1). Overall, the quaternary structure of EcAII has little
influence on its antigenicity under the conditions tested (Figures 3 and S8), yet the mode of immobilization has a clearly
discernable effect on antibody–antigen affinity. Furthermore,
we demonstrated that the presence of a His-tag is compatible with
maintaining the antigenicity of EcAII.

native and His-tagged EcAII in ELISA.

were fitted to a one-site binding model. The error bars show standard
deviation for triplicate reads. (A) Proteins were randomly adsorbed
onto Nunc-Maxisorp plates. Detection was performed with Fc-specific
goat horse radish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antirabbit IgG (1:1000
dilution) and 0.16% H2O2. (B) ELISA with His-tagged
variants immobilized in an oriented manner on Ni-NTA-coated microplates.

The impact of quaternary structure
and mode of immobilization of
EcAII on the extent of surface coverage was monitored on gold chips,
and the immunosensing properties of immobilized EcAII variants were
assessed using SPR. Native EcAII (Kidrolase) was immobilized onto
the gold sensing surface in a randomly oriented fashion by covalent
cross-linking of lysine residues using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS) chemistry, whereas His-tagged
EcAII variants were immobilized in an oriented fashion by metal affinity
coordination (Co-NTA) (Figures 4 and S9). At equal protein concentration,
the protein coverage (Γ) determined for oriented His-tagged
EcAII was 5-fold to more than 10-fold greater than for randomly oriented
native EcAII (Kidrolase) (Table 2 and Figure 5). As for covalently bound Kidrolase, the metal-chelated His-tagged
EcAII variants remained surface-bound upon extensive washing of the
sensor chip, with the exception of the monomeric C8-EcAII that showed
some dissociation (Figure 4A). Importantly, the surface coverage for His-tagged EcAII
was highly reproducible with relative standard deviation (RSD) ranging
between 3 and 18%, contrary to cross-linked Kidrolase that afforded
poor reproducibility (RSD 50–70%). We confirmed that the glycine
present in the lyophilized Kidrolase preparation was not the cause
of the poor surface coverage observed because no significant difference
was observed upon dialysis of the resuspended Kidrolase (Γ =
60.25 ± 43.3 ng cm–2 without dialysis or 45.8
± 44.7 ng cm–2 with dialysis). This suggests
that the cross-linking method itself leads to lower yields and lower
reproducibility of immobilization than the metal coordination of terminal
His-tags, which is an important consideration for the development
of an immunosensor.

relative to N26-EcAII or N21-EcAII correlates with our observation
of ready dissociation of C8-EcAII from the Ni-NTA purification column
(with 70 mM imidazole) relative to the latter (with 250 mM imidazole).
The short C-terminal tag (8 residues) may be less accessible for chelation
than the 20- and 25-residue N-terminal tags. The activity of EcAII
variants immobilized on the gold sensing surface was monitored to
assess their integrity (Figure 4B). The same pattern of specific activity was observed as
that for free EcAII, where native EcAII was 2 to 4-fold more active
than the His-tagged forms. In addition, the immobilized EcAII was
2.6 to 3.6-fold more active than the free enzyme (Table 2), consistent with other reports
of enzymes that display higher specific activity upon immobilization.45,46 Our results suggest that the tetrameric proteins remained essentially
intact when immobilized on the sensing surface. Surface-immobilized
monomeric C8-EcAII was inactive, indicating that it did not reassemble
into an active tetramer upon immobilization on the sensor chip.

The greater surface density observed for both N-terminally His-tagged
EcAII relative to Kidrolase and C8-EcAII suggests that the N-terminally
tagged EcAII may constitute more effective receptors for the detection
of the anti-EcAII antibody (Ab). This was verified by assessing the
SPR immunosensing signal using the P4SPR instrument and determined
as the wavelength shift upon binding of polyclonal anti-EcAII antibodies
(Ab) to immobilized EcAII antigenic receptors (Ag) directly in undiluted
serum. The immunodetection was performed at two antibody concentrations
within an analytically relevant range (15 and 150 μg mL–1).23 At 15 μg mL–1 antibody concentration (∼100 nM), N26-EcAII
and C8-EcAII provided approximately 2-fold greater SPR detection signal
than did native EcAII (Kidrolase) and monomeric C8-EcAII. This difference
was accentuated at 150 μg mL–1 (∼1
μM) antibody concentration, where oriented tetrameric N- and
C-terminally tagged-EcAII provided approximately 5-fold and 3-fold
greater detection signal than nonoriented cross-linked Kidrolase and
oriented monomeric C8-EcAII, respectively (Figure 5 and Table 2). In addition to being less sensitive (lower detection
signal generated), Kidrolase led to poor sensing reproducibility (average
RSD = 35%) compared with the His-tagged variants (average RSD = 5–20%)
at all antibody concentrations tested. A positive correlation was
drawn between the immunosensing signal (detection of antibody; Ab)
and the surface coverage of EcAII receptors (immobilized antigen;
Ag), with R2 = 0.9571 at the high antibody
concentration (150 μg mL–1) and the oriented
N-terminally tagged EcAII reliably providing the highest SPR signal
(Figure 5A). At a lower
antibody concentration (15 μg mL–1), the correlation
was not as strong (R2 = 0.6102).

To better understand the behavior of EcAII as an antigenic receptor
for sensing, a second property was verified, namely, the sensing efficiency
(efficiency of analyte recognition). This is defined as the number
of analyte molecules (antibody; Ab) detected per molecule of the immobilized
receptor (EcAII antigen; Ag) or the Ab/Ag binding ratio. Despite its
low surface density and poor sensitivity, we observed that the native
tetrameric EcAII (Kidrolase) afforded a significantly greater sensing
efficiency than the tetrameric His-tagged EcAII. At 150 μg mL–1 antibody concentration, an average of 2.3 antibody
molecules were detected per immobilized Kidrolase molecule (Ab/Ag
binding ratio ≈ 2:1; Table 2). This ratio is 2 to 3-fold more efficient than for
the tetrameric His-tagged EcAII variants, which bound only 0.9 antibody
per molecule (Ab/Ag < 1:1). The lower Ab/Ag binding ratio of tetrameric
His-tagged variants may be related to their higher density on the
gold sensing surface than Kidrolase. Native EcAII has an average surface
density of ∼1.15 × 1012 molecules cm–2 in the plane of the crystal lattice (PDB 3ECA), with an average distance between protein
tetramers of ∼11.4 nm, from center to center (c.t.c.). On the
sensing surface, the density of the immobilized Kidrolase was ∼7-fold
lower (1.6 × 1011 molecules cm–2) with the average c.t.c. distance between the immobilized tetramers
∼2.7-fold greater (∼30.5 nm). On the contrary, the surface
density of tetrameric His-tagged EcAII variants immobilized on the
sensing surface was ∼1.3 to 1.8-fold greater than in the crystal
lattice, with c.t.c. distances between tetramers ∼1.2 to 1.3-fold
shorter. Their higher packing may be promoted by their 8- to 25-residue
terminal linkers, allowing for some overlapping of the immobilized
tetramers and may favor bivalent antibody binding between the tightly
packed EcAII molecules (allowing each Fab domain to bind two distinct
neighbor Ag molecules), consistent with the lower Ab/Ag binding ratio
(<1:1) (Figure 5B and Table 2). This
contrasts with the looser packing of Kidrolase molecules, which appears
to provide additional space between Kidrolase tetramers for antibodies
to bind, consistent with the observation of an Ab/Ag binding ratio
as high as 2:1.

Despite a low surface density (c.t.c. distance
33% larger than
in the crystal), monomeric C8-EcAII lost in sensing efficiency (Ab/Ag
ratio = 0.2) if one considers molar ratios because the tetrameric
EcAII benefits from four Ab binding sites per Ag molecule. Nonetheless,
the sensing efficiencies of monomeric and tetrameric C8-EcAII were
similar if considering equal amounts of subunit molecules (Table 2).

At a lower
antibody concentration (15 μg mL–1), a similar
trend was seen, yet the Ab/Ag ratio was always lower.
Specifically, we observed an average of 1.3 antibody bound per Kidrolase
tetramer (Ab/Ag binding ratio ≈ 1:1) and 0.2–0.3 antibody
bound per His-tagged EcAII variant (Ab/Ag binding ratio ≈ 0.25:1)
(Figure 5B and Table 2).

Overall,
the lower sensing efficiency of the tetrameric His-tagged
EcAII receptors was more than compensated for by their greater surface
density (coverage) and by their high reproducibility relative to Kidrolase.
These factors ultimately afforded significantly greater sensitivity
when detecting anti-EcAII antibodies in the serum (Figure 5A).

Conclusions
We
have examined the sensing properties of EcAII immobilized by
various modes onto low-fouling SPR sensor chips for the detection
of anti-EcAII antibodies in serum. We have determined that the native
tetrameric structure, while being essential for activity, is not required
for antibody recognition. Moreover, we showed that the extent of immobilization
of EcAII was the main determinant of its immunosensing efficiency.
Metal-coordination of His-tagged EcAII variants provided a significantly
greater sensor coverage than covalent immobilization of native EcAII
and therefore provided a greater sensitivity despite their reduced
sensing efficiency per molecule. Moreover, metal chelation significantly
improved the reproducibility of EcAII immobilization. This study illustrates
the benefits of testing alternative immobilization strategies and
highlights the positive impact of high receptor coverage and immobilization
reproducibility toward obtaining a well-behaved sensing system.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Reagents
The pharmaceutical drug Kidrolase
(EUSA Pharma) was obtained as a lyophilized powder that contains 48.6%
mass of glycine–NaOH, pH 6.8–7.0 and 51.4% mass of E. colil-asparaginase II (EcAII) with an
activity of 194.6 IU mg–1. It was dissolved in a
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer, pH 7.4 and prepared at a concentration
of 0.1 mg mL–1 (0.72 μM EcAII/0.65 mM glycine)
for SPR analyses or was dialyzed against PBS to remove glycine. l-Glutamate dehydrogenase (NADP) from Proteus sp. was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. l-Asparagine and
α-ketoglutaric acid were purchased from BioShop. NADPH tetrasodium
salt was purchased from Calbiotech. The plasmid pET15b was purchased
from Novagen. Human serum was purchased from Sigma. The E. colil-asparaginase II (ansB) gene from E. coli K12 was obtained from the ASKA collection
as a pCA24N-ansB construct.

His-Tagged EcAII Constructs
The
full-length EcAII precursor
ORF, including the signal peptide sequence (1044 bp), was amplified
using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the pCA24N/ansB construct
using the following primers (restriction sites are underlined): 5′-AAACATATGGAGTTTTTCAAAAAGACGGC-3′ (forward primer
containing the NdeI restriction site) and 5′-AAAACTCGAGGTACTGATTGAAGATCTGCT-3′ (reverse primer
containing the XhoI restriction site) ligated into
the similarly digested pET20b expression vector (Invitrogen). The
resultant protein, named C8-EcAII, includes a C-terminal octapeptide
His-tag (LEHHHHHH). To fuse an N-terminal His-tag to EcAII, the DNA
sequence encoding the mature form of EcAII (978 bp) was amplified
using PCR from the pET20b/ansB construct using the following primers:
5′-GGAATTCCATATGTTACCCAATATCACCATTTTAGC-3′
(forward primer containing the NdeI restriction site)
and 5′-CGGCTCGAGTTAGTACTGATTGAAGATCTG-3′
(reverse primer containing the XhoI site). The ochre
stop codon, TAA, was included (in bold in the reverse sequence). The
amplicon was digested with the corresponding restriction enzymes and
ligated into similarly digested pET15b vector for N-terminal fusion
with a sequence encoding 21 residues containing a His6-tag,
yielding the construct N21-EcAII. A second N-terminal fusion was constructed
by introducing an enterokinase cleavage site between the mature EcAII
sequence and the previous N-terminal fusion. The mature sequence was
amplified from the pET15b/ansB construct with the forward primer:
5′-GGAATTCCATATGGACGACGACGACAAGTTACCCAATATCACCATTTTAGC-3′ and the same reverse primer as
for N21-EcAII. It was similarly ligated into pET15b, yielding the
construct N26-EcAII. The DNA sequence encoding the enterokinase cleavage
site is shown in bold in the forward sequence. Each ligation was transformed
into competent E. coli BL21(DE3). The
transformed cells were plated onto luria broth (LB)-agar containing
ampicillin (Amp; 100 μg mL–1), and the clones
were selected and cultured in LB containing Amp (100 μg mL–1) and stored at −80 °C in 25% GOH. The
plasmids were isolated and the ORFs were sequenced at the IRIC Genomic
Platform at Université de Montréal, using the T7 promoter
and terminator primers. The DNA sequences were analyzed using the
Clone Manager 9 (version 9.2) software.

Protein Expression and
Purification
For N-terminally
tagged EcAII (N21- and N26-EcAII), the cytosolic expression was performed
as follows. Terrific broth (TB) (Amp 100 μg mL–1) was inoculated with the appropriate GOH stocks and grown overnight
at 37 °C and 230 rpm agitation. For the expression, 4 L flasks
filled to 25% capacity with TB + Amp were inoculated with the appropriate
precultures (1:1000 ratio), and the cells were grown at 37 °C
and 230 rpm, until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.6. The
protein expression was then induced overnight at 18 °C and 230
rpm by the addition of 0.5 mM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG). The induced cells were harvested by centrifugation for 30
min at 3500 rpm using a SLA-3000 rotor. The cell pellets were stored
at −80 °C for 24 h, then thawed on ice, and resuspended
in the lysis buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, 10–20 mM imidazole,
and 150 mM NaCl, pH 8) at a ratio of 10% (w/v). Lysozyme (final concentration
of 1–2 mg mL–1) was added, and the cells
were placed on ice for 30 min, before clarification by sonication
on ice for three 15 s cycles at 20 pulses/s. The cells were lysed
using a Constant Systems cell disruptor (27 kPSI) cooled to 4 °C.
The lysates were clarified from the cell debris by centrifugation
for 30 min at 17.5k rpm using a SS-34 rotor and cooled to 4 °C.
The supernatants were filtered through 0.2 μm filters, and the
expressed His-tagged recombinant proteins were purified from the soluble
fraction under native conditions by immobilized metal affinity chromatography
(IMAC) (Ni-NTA) at 4 °C using a ÄKTA FPLC system equipped
with a UPC-900 monitor and a P-20 pump system (GE Healthcare) and
a 5 mL His-trap column (GE Healthcare). The nickel resin was equilibrated
with 5 column volumes (CV) of the lysis buffer. The lysate was applied
at a flow rate of 0.5 mL min–1. After the recovery
of the absorbance baseline at 280 nm, an imidazole gradient of 10–100
mM was applied over 3 CV and maintained at 100 mM for 3 CV before
eluting with a jump to 500 mM imidazole. Fractions of 1 mL were collected.
Following the analysis on 15% SDS-PAGE, the fractions containing EcAII
were pooled, concentrated to 1 mL using an Amicon concentrator [molecular
weight cutoff (MWCO) = 10 kDa] and applied at a flow rate of 0.5 mL
min–1 on a 90 mL Superdex 75 gel filtration column
(1.6 × 55 cm) equilibrated with PBS, pH 7.4 at 4 °C. The
collected 0.5 mL fractions corresponding to the major peak were analyzed
using 15% SDS-PAGE, and the fractions of highest purity were pooled.
The protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid
(BCA) method47 with bovine serum albumin
(BSA) and Kidrolase as standards. The purified EcAII samples were
diluted to 0.1–1 mg mL–1 in PBS, pH 7.4,
aliquoted, and flash-frozen over dry ice/ethanol for storage at −80
°C. Similar procedures were performed for purification of the
C-terminally His-tagged C8-EcAII, with the following modifications.
Periplasmic expression of C8-EcAII was performed in a ZYP-5052 auto-inducing
medium inoculated (1:100) with a preculture. Following growth at 37
°C for 2 h, the cultures were incubated at 20 °C for overnight expression. Following
the application of the cell lysate onto the His-trap column, the elution
was performed by a stepwise gradient from 20 to 250 mM. The purified
protein was quantified, filter sterilized (0.2 μm), and flash-frozen
for storage at −80 °C or kept at 4 °C.

Exact Mass
Determination (LC–MS)
The exact mass
of the purified proteins (0.1 mg mL–1 in PBS) was
determined using electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry on
a LC–MS time of flight (TOF) (Agilent) spectrometer at the
Regional Mass Spectrometry Centre at Université de Montréal.

l-Asparaginase Activity Measurements
The hydrolysis
of l-Asn catalyzed by EcAII was assessed using spectrophotometry
at 37 °C by monitoring ammonia production as an end-point assay
using direct Nesslerization or using a continuous coupled assay with
GDH.38 Each reagent was freshly prepared
in the reaction buffer (modified PBS: sodium phosphate concentration
increased to 50 mM and pH adjusted to 8 before the experiment).

Direct Nesslerization
A standard curve for ammonia
concentration was generated with the (NH4)2SO4 concentration ranging from 0 to 5 mM in PBS, pH 8 or Tris-HCl,
pH 8.6. The EcAII reactions (1 mL) were performed in the same buffer
with 5 μg of l-asparaginase and 9 mM l-Asn.
Each reaction was performed for 30 min at 37 °C and then quenched
with 0.05 mL of 1 M trichloroacetic acid. A total of 0.1 mL of the
reaction solution was used for revelation with 0.25 mL of Nessler
reagent and 2.15 mL of water (final volume of 2.5 mL), and the absorbance
was measured at 450 nm. The enzyme specific activity was determined
based on freshly generated standard curves.

Coupled assay
The ammonia produced upon l-Asn
hydrolysis by EcAII served as the substrate for the second enzyme
GDH in a coupled reaction that converts α-ketoglutarate into
glutamate with the oxidation of NADPH into NADP+. The reaction
rate was observed in a continuous manner by monitoring the decrease
in the NADPH absorbance at 340 nm, using ε340nm =
6.22 mM–1 cm–1. The parameters
of the coupled assay were optimized regarding the concentration of
GDH and each substrate. To this effect, the affinity and the catalytic
efficiency of GDH for ammonia were determined under saturated concentrations
of NADPH (250 μM = 10 × KM)
and α-ketoglutarate (175 μM = 17 × KM) and variable concentrations of NH4Cl (0–50
mM) (Table S1). The ammonia produced by
EcAII at a saturated concentration of freshly prepared l-Asn
(5 mM ≈ 500 × KM) was monitored
using the coupled GDH assay under the saturated conditions described
above (freshly prepared substrates) with various amounts of EcAII
(0.1–10 μg). The maximal rate of NADPH oxidation (maximal
GDH velocity) was then plotted as a function of EcAII loading. The
slope of the linear portion of the curve (dynamic range) observed
from 0.1 to 1 μg EcAII was taken as the apparent specific EcAII
activity (μmole NADPH oxidized/min per mg of EcAII) under the
assay conditions. We refer to this value in terms of units (U mg–1 EcAII) in the coupled assay.

SEC
The oligomerization states of native EcAII (Kidrolase)
and each His-tagged EcAII were analyzed using analytical SEC using
an ÄKTA FPLC system. Different protein concentrations (0.4
mL injections) were applied onto a calibrated 24 mL size exclusion
column (GE Superdex 200, 10/300 mm) equilibrated with PBS, pH 7.4
at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min in PBS, pH 7.4 at 4 °C. The EcAII
oligomeric forms were determined by correlating the elution volume
(Ve) of each peak with both the expected
MW according to the elution volume of protein standards and the Stoke’s
radius. The calculated accessible surface area (ASA) reported for
the monomer is 14 000 Å2 but only 38 500
Å2 for the tetramer.14,48 When considering
the Stoke’s radius of the calibration standards, the calculated
Stoke’s radius of the EcAII tetramer (39 Å) is consistent
with the measured Stoke’s radius both in crystal form (32 Å)
and in solution (30.3 Å).49

Native-PAGE
Protein preparations were concentrated
to 2.5 mg mL–1 in PBS, pH 7.4 using Amicon concentrators
(MWCO = 10 kDa) and analyzed using CN-PAGE and BN-PAGE using Novex
NativePAGE 4–16% Bis-Tris gels (1.0 mm), pH 7. For BN-PAGE,
the protein samples were prepared in a loading dye consisting of 50
mM Bis-Tris, 500 mM ACA, 10% GOH, and 5% Coomassie blue G-250 and
applied to 4–16% Bis-Tris gels or 10% Bis-Tris gels. Native
electrophoresis was performed with deep or light blue cathode buffer
[50 mM tricine, 15 mM Bis-Tris with 0.02% (deep) or 0.001% (light)
Coomassie blue G-250] and anode buffer (50 mM Bis-Tris), both adjusted
to pH 7. Electrophoresis under light blue conditions was referred
to as LBN-PAGE. For CN-PAGE, the Coomassie blue G-250 loading dye
was replaced by bromophenol blue with or without ACA. In addition,
a clear cathode buffer was used (without G-250). Electrophoresis was
performed for 2 h at 90–100 V. CN-PAGE gels were stained with
Coomassie brilliant blue R-250. CN-PAGE and BN-PAGE gels were destained
with 10% acetic acid and 45% methanol.

CD
The CD spectra
of Kidrolase and each His-tagged
EcAII were recorded using a Chirascan spectropolarimeter (Applied
Photophysics). Far-UV CD spectra (190–250 nm) were recorded
under a nitrogen atmosphere at 25 °C in PBS, pH 7.4 with a protein
concentration of 0.1 mg mL–1 in a 1 mm quartz cuvette.
The scans were performed with a step of 0.4 nm (3.6 s/point) and a
bandwidth of 1 nm. The spectra were corrected from the background
(buffer). The data were converted into molar ellipticity (Θ).

Fluorescence Spectroscopy
Intrinsic fluorescence measurements
were performed using a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrofluorimeter. Fluorescence
spectra were recorded from 287 to 450 nm after excitation at 278.5
nm (λmax of absorption) at a protein concentration
of 0.05 mg mL–1 in PBS, pH 7.4 in a 1 cm quartz
cuvette. Thermal denaturation was performed from 20 to 90 °C
(0.5 °C/min) using a Peltier temperature controller. Melting
curves were generated by plotting the fluorescence intensity at λmax for emission as a function of temperature. Although the
chemical denaturation of EcAII may proceed via the intimate dimer
intermediate (N4 → 2I2 → 4U),50 the thermal denaturation was treated as an apparent
two-state process, consistent with the overall shape of the unfolding
curves. We thus determined the apparent melting temperature by fitting
to a two-state model (N → D), where denaturation operates between
the fraction of native (fN) and denatured
(fD) molecules and where fN + fD = 1. In this model,
the fluorescence signal value (y) at any point of
the unfolding curve is given by the following equation.51 1  

The values yN and yD correspond
to the fluorescence
intensity for the native and denatured states, respectively. By combining
these equations, the fraction of denatured molecules at any value
of y (fluorescence intensity) is obtained by the
following equation 2  

The denaturation equilibrium constant can be calculated as
follows 3  

The unfolding free energy change can be calculated as follows 4  

The melting temperature
(Tm) can be
obtained by plotting the unfolding free energy (ΔG) as a function of temperature, where Tm corresponds to the temperature where fN = fD and the unfolding free energy is
null (ΔG = 0). We noted that, beyond the inflection
point, some aggregation was observed.

ELISA
MaxiSorp
microplates (Nunc-Immuno plate, Thomas
Scientific, cat no. 62409-50) were coated with 0.1 mL of native or
His-tagged EcAII (10 μg mL–1) diluted in 0.05
M carbonate/bicarbonate, pH 9.5 and incubated overnight at 4 °C.
ELISA assays were performed, as reported by Wang and co-authors,12 with the following modifications: the primary
rabbit polyclonal anti-EcAII antibody (IgG) ANSZ (Antibodies Online,
cat no. ABIN95396) was resuspended in human serum (Sigma, cat no.
H4522) and diluted in PBS, pH 7.4 to concentrations ranging from 0.1
pM to 1 μM for calibration, assuming a MW of 150 kDa. Polyclonal
HRP-conjugated goat antirabbit IgG (Abcam, cat no. ab97200) at a dilution
of (1:1000) in PBS was used for secondary detection. A volume of 0.1
mL of freshly made 0.4 mg mL–1o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD) prepared in 0.1 M citrate
buffer, pH 6 containing 0.02, 0.16, or 3% hydrogen peroxide (high,
intermediate, and low sensitivity conditions, respectively) was added
to the wells and incubated for 30 min in the dark, after which the
reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.1 mL of 1 M phosphoric acid.
The anti-EcAII antibody concentration was measured by monitoring the
absorbance at 490 nm (specific product absorption). The absorbance
at 490 nm was then subtracted from the absorbance at 650 nm to control
for nonspecific adsorption. Oriented His-tagged EcAII were further
analyzed using ELISA using Pierce Nickel-coated plates. Calibration
was performed with the ANSZ antibody from Antibodies Online and was
confirmed with a rabbit polyclonal antil-asparaginase II
antibody (IgG) from Novus Biologicals (NB100-66516; not shown). The
titration curves were fitted to a logarithmic function, and the dissociation
constant was measured using multiple binding sites analysis using
the GraphPad Prism 6.0 software.

Sensor Chip Fabrication
Sensor chips were constructed
by depositing a thin gold film on either 9 × 9 × 0.5 mm
glass slides for monitoring the extent of immobilization and on-chip
asparaginase activity or on 20 × 12 × 3 mm glass prisms
for immunosensing in a portable P4SPR instrument (Affinité
Instruments) that has been described in a previous report.19 Sensing surfaces were prepared by depositing
chromium (∼0.7 nm thick) and then gold (∼50 nm thick)
on the glass surface using a Cressington 308R sputter coater (Tel
Pella Inc.). SPR sensing experiments (wavelength interrogation) were
performed in Kretschmann configuration. The gold surfaces were immersed
in a 1 mg mL–1 solution of 3-MPA-LHDLHD-OH peptide
in dimethylformamide (DMF) to form a SAM that prevented surface fouling.22,52 The terminal carboxylates on the SAM remain free, to covalently
immobilize native EcAII by cross-linking with its surface-exposed
lysine residues. For immobilization of EcAII by coordination of terminal
His-tags, the SAM was functionalized with NTA-Co to yield Au-MPA-LHDLHD-NTA-Co,
as previously described.17

On-Chip Measurement
of Activity and Extent of Immobilization
The specific activity
of immobilized EcAII was monitored on the
9 × 9 mm gold-covered chips. The SAM-functionalized chips were
placed on a dove prism (above a thin layer of immersion oil) and sealed
with a rubber ring fitted in the injection module. The chip surface
was rinsed with water and then with the buffer (PBS, pH 7.4). Following
the adjustment of the plasmonic band (typical minimum at ≈
620 nm), the baseline was set in S polarization, and the reference
was collected (average of 10 scans per spectrum for a total of 100
spectra). The sample wavelength shifts (ΔλSPR) were recorded in P polarization. The native EcAII was surface-immobilized
by cross-linking its surface-exposed lysines to the free carboxylates
of the SAM, using a previously-reported EDC/NHS cross-linking procedure.53 The chip was rinsed with at least 6 mL of the
buffer for 2 min, and 1 mL of EDC/NHS (1:1 mixture with a final concentration
of 200 and 100 mM, respectively) was injected on the peptide surface.
PBS, pH 4.5 was injected to activate the surface (for 2 min), and
0.8 mL of 0.1 mg mL–1 native EcAII (Kidrolase) was
injected. Surface immobilization was monitored for 20 min before the
surface was washed with 6 mL of PBS. Immobilizing the His-tagged EcAII
onto NTA-Co-functionalized SAM was performed as above, with the exception
of the EDC/NHS and the PBS, pH 4.5 injection steps.

The surface
coverage (Γ, ng cm–2) of the immobilized native
or His-tagged EcAII was calculated from the change in the wavelength
(ΔλSPR) upon immobilization of EcAII using
the following equation54 5  where ρ corresponds to the density of
the adsorbed protein monolayer (1.3 g cm–3), ld is the plasmon penetration distance (∼230
nm), Δλ is the shift in the wavelength associated with
protein immobilization, m is the refractive index
sensitivity of the SPR sensor (1765 nm/RIU), nSAM is the refractive index of the peptide SAM (1.57 RIU),
and nmedium is the refractive index of
the buffer (1.33476 RIU). The total amount of immobilized EcAII on
the sensing surface (Q) was determined using the
formula Q = ΓS, where S = 0.166 cm2 in contact with the protein.

To monitor the activity of the surface-immobilized EcAII, the 9
× 9 mm EcAII-coated chips were placed upright along the side
wall of a UV/vis quartz cuvette.17 The
chips were immersed in a solution containing 5 mM l-Asn,
17 KM α-ketoglutarate, 10 KM NADPH, and 1.0 IU GDH in a modified PBS buffer,
pH 8 (as described for asparaginase activity measurements) with slow
agitation. The activity of the immobilized EcAII was measured by monitoring
the change in the absorbance at 340 nm over 240 min because of the
oxidation of NADPH accompanying the consumption of ammonia by GDH.
The maximal GDH velocity was corrected from the blank (no EcAII) and
was used to determine the activity of the immobilized EcAII. The specific
activity (U mg–1) of the immobilized EcAII was determined
according to the mass of the immobilized protein (Q) on the chip.

SPR Immunosensing
SPR immunosensing
experiments were
performed using the P4SPR portable instrument (Affinité Instruments).19 The 20 × 12 mm dove prisms coated with
gold and functionalized with the appropriate antifouling SAM (as described
above, either with or without NTA-Co) were placed in the P4SPR instrument
for EcAII immobilization. The baseline from 1 mL of PBS was recorded
for 2 min, and native or His-tagged EcAII (0.4 mL of 0.1 mg mL–1 protein) was injected as above, followed by rinsing
with 1 mL of PBS for 2 min. Following immobilization, 0.4 mL of blank
human serum was injected over 10 min to passivate the surface. Human
serum spiked with different concentrations of polyclonal rabbit anti-asparaginase
antibodies (0.4 mL) was then injected, and antibody binding was monitored
for 20 min. Calibration of the sensor was performed with serial injections
of increasing concentrations of anti-asparaginase antibodies on a
single sensor chip, as previously described.23 The SPR shifts were calculated with MATLAB software and served to
calculate the surface density of the analyte bound onto the immobilized
antigenic receptors, as described above. Taking into account the exact
MW of each EcAII variant, we calculated the number of EcAII molecules
immobilized on the sensing surface (molecule cm–2). Calculation of the number of antibody molecules bound to antigen
was based on a MW of 150 kDa for the antibody. Statistical analysis
of the variance was performed according to Tukey’s multiple
means comparison test identified by one-way ANOVA. Dimensions of the
unit cell of tetrameric EcAII in crystal form (PDB 3ECA: a = 7.6 × b = 9.6 × c =
11.1 nm; α = 90°, β = 97.1°, γ = 90°)
allowed estimating an average footprint of 87 nm2 (8.7
× 10–13 cm2) per tetrameric EcAII
molecule, with an average distance from c.t.c. between EcAII molecules
of 11.4 nm in the crystal. The surface density of 1.15 × 1012 molecules cm–2 in the plane of the crystal
lattice allows to scale the distance between the immobilized tetrameric
EcAII receptors on the sensing surface based on their determined surface
density. Dimensions of the unit cell for monomeric EcAII (PDB 1NNS; monomeric asymmetric
unit: a = 7.6 × b = 13.5 × c = 6.5 nm; α = 90°, β = 97.1°, γ
= 90°) allowed estimating an average footprint of 80 nm2 (8 × 10–13 cm2) per monomer with
an average c.t.c of 10.8 nm in the plane of the crystal lattice.
