In the recent times,
scanty access to clean water has been one
of the most prevalent problems, affecting humankind throughout the
world. This calls for a tremendous amount of research to recognize
new methods of purifying water at lower cost, minimizing the use of
hazardous chemicals and impact on the environment. The interest of
the scientific community in the potential applications of renewable
feedstock-based hydrogels for heavy-metal adsorption for water remediation
has been continuously increasing during the last few decades. This
study is an effort to highlight the application of hydrogels for revolutionizing
the present research on heavy-metal adsorption, particularly arsenic.
Besides, the arsenic chemistry, health hazards of arsenic to human
health, and adsorption of arsenic by natural polymer-based hydrogels
have been reviewed in detail. In addition, challenges in taking the
hydrogel technology forward and future prospectives like cost, handling,
and disposal of the adsorbent have been discussed systematically.

==== Body
1 Background
Water is one of the basic
necessities required for the sustenance
and continuation of life. However, as a result of rapid urbanization,
population growth, and climate disruption, increased demand of clean
water has become an unprecedented urgent global issue.1 Some of the common pollutants of water are dyes, phenols
insecticides, pesticides, and heavy metals.2 Among the above-mentioned common pollutants, the release of heavy
metals into the environment has risen dramatically in the past decades
due to rapid industrialization and population growth.3,4

Arsenic ranks first in the top 20 hazardous heavy metals.5 Arsenic is a metalloid and mainly exists in four
oxidation states: As(V), As(III), As(0), and As3–; however, the most predominate states are As(III) and As(V).6 The As(III) and As(V) ions are of great interest
from research point of view as they are the most common forms of arsenic
found in water and cause severe health threats to humankind.7 Contamination of drinking water by arsenic has
affected the health of more than 150 million people all over the world,
out of which around 110 million people live in Bangladesh, Cambodia,
China, India, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Taiwan, and Vietnam.
According to a report, about 35–77 million Bangladeshi people
are at a high risk of exposure to As-contaminated water.6,8

Various strategies have been adopted to remove arsenic from
water
sources, including oxidation/precipitation, coagulation, ion exchange,
and membrane-based separation. These chemical methods are simple,
but the disadvantages associated with these methods include huge amount
of toxic sludge, slow metal precipitation, poor settling, and aggregation
of metal precipitates, which need further treatment before disposal
into the environment. Further, fouling of membrane surface, clogging
of membrane channels, high operating cost, and more complex operations
are several disadvantages associated with the membrane technique.9,10 Hence, there is an imperative need to find novel approaches for
purifying water at low cost, using less energy, and above all to minimize
the impact on the environment.11 Among
all of the aforementioned treatments, the adsorption technique has
proven to be more economical and efficient for the removal of even
small traces of arsenic from water. Moreover, this method has distinct
advantages like easy setup, no need of additional chemicals, and does
not produce harmful byproducts. Additionally, this technique requires
less operator expertize, low operating cost, and low maintenance cost.12

Of late, hydrogels prepared from biopolymers
have been widely used
in industrial applications, especially for heavy-metal adsorption.
For instance, cellulose, sodium alginate (SA), chitosan, dextrin,
and xylan-based hydrogels have been used for the removal of Fe(II),
Cu(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Cd(II), As(III), and As(V) from aqueous solutions.13−16 Several biopolymers, such as sodium alginate,17 starch,18 hemicellulose,19 chitin,20 cellulose,21 and their derivatives, have been used to develop
hydrogels.

However, several challenges like recovery of nanohydrogel
from
solution after adsorption and desorption processes, selective removal,
recovery of the targeted pollutant, and stability of the hydrogel
need to be confronted, which will decide the providence and reusability
of the bio-based hydrogel. In addition, the reusability of the hydrogel
by desorption of heavy metals and regaining of the adsorption capacity
after several treatment cycles need to be considered. Such findings
are encouraging because if a hydrogel prepared from renewable feedstock
is highly reusable, it can make the overall process more economical
and sustainable.22

Several review
articles have been published to date, which deal
with arsenic removal by adsorption, but the present study endeavors
to highlight the application of hydrogel as an adsorbent (mainly renewable
resource-based hydrogels) for arsenic removal. Herein, we attempted
to summarize the scientific roadmap of various strategies used for
arsenic removal, with special focus on renewable feedstock-based hydrogels.
The discussion covers arsenic chemistry, resources of arsenic, hazards
of arsenic to human health, various adsorption technologies for arsenic
removal, general discussion of hydrogels, and adsorption of arsenic
by hydrogels in detail. Besides, the aim of this study is to compile
and represent the adsorption potential of various hydrogels for arsenic
removal prepared from pectin, chitosan, cellulose, sodium alginate,
and cellulose. A summary of published research data with some results
has also been presented. Further, challenges like operational pH range,
interference, and hydrogel recovery are discussed. Besides, reusability
of hydrogels, stability and resource recovery, safe disposal of arsenic
sludge, and future perspectives of hydrogel are discussed in this
study.

2 Arsenic Remediation by Hydrogel
Recently,
hydrogel-based adsorbents have attracted special attention
because of their potential in removing heavy metals from wastewater.19 Hydrogels are three-dimensional porous structures
that exhibit chemically responsive functional groups, enabling the
hydrogel to readily capture metal ions from contaminated water and
simultaneously release and clear these metal ions from the hydrogels
upon changing the environmental conditions. Owing to the presence
of carboxylic acid, amine, hydroxyl, or sulfonic acid groups, metal
ions can penetrate the porous network structure of hydrogels and form
stable complexes with these groups.23 Arsenic
remediation by hydrogels involves several mechanisms like electrostatic
interactions, surface area and pore volume formation of hydrogel,
complex formation, chelation, and physiorption.24−27 However, it is very difficult
to comment on the type of mechanism involved in arsenic removal by
hydrogels. pH is also an important parameter that affects hydrogel
performance by influencing metal-ion chelation with the functional
groups of hydrogel.28 Perhaps, the most
predominant factor is the simultaneous presence of numerous metal
ions and counterions, which may participate in complex synergistic
and conflicting mechanisms as they compete for binding sites in the
polymeric hydrogel structure. It is evident from the literature that
different mechanisms are involved in arsenic removal by different
hydrogels. According to the literature, because of the presence of
a large number of polar functional groups, electrostatic interaction
is considered to be the main mechanism for the removal of arsenic
ions.29,30 Moreover, the hydrogel having negatively
charged surface can adsorb positively charged metal ion through electrostatic
interaction mechanism. Besides, in some cases, chelation of heavy
metal with the polar groups of hydrogel has also been reported. The
ion-exchange mechanism of arsenic removal has also been reported by
the hydrogels possessing acidic or basic functional groups.22

2.1 Chitosan
Chitosan
is the second most
abundant polymer in nature after cellulose. Chitosan is poly [β-(1–4)-2-amino-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranose], which is formed by β(1–4)-linkages
between d-glucosamine and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine units. Chitosan exhibits high affinity for heavy metals
like mercury, arsenic, cadmium, lead, etc. Adsorption of heavy metals
can occur by chelation, electrostatic interaction in neutral solutions,
or ion-exchange mechanisms in acidic solutions.31,32 At neutral pH, when the −NH2 groups are not protonated,
chitosan can undergo the following reaction with the metal ions (1) 1  From
the above equation, we observe that the
efficiency of chitosan as an adsorbent increases with the increase
in the number of free −NH2 groups and hence also
the degree of deacetylation.33

Chitosan
and its derivatives have been widely used for arsenic removal since
long time.31 For instance, Chen et al.34 synthesized chitosan beads using agricultural
waste for arsenic removal with maximum adsorption efficiency at pH
5. The synthesized chitosan beads favored the adsorption of As(V)(1.83
mg/g) over As(III)(1.94 mg/g); however, the authors did not explain
the reason for the same behavior. Su et al.24 fabricated highly porous nanoscale zero-valent iron/chitosan composite
foams (ICCFs) for inorganic arsenic removal by freeze-drying method
(Figure 1). The fabricated
ICCFs exhibited good mechanical properties as well as excellent removal
efficiencies of As(III) (114.9 mg/g) and As(V) (86.87 mg/g). The authors
discussed the mechanism of arsenic removal in detail and revealed
that the adsorption follows a pseudo-second-order model and their
isotherms follow the Langmuir adsorption model.

Molybdate-impregnated chitosan beads for effective adsorption
of
As(V) were prepared by Dambies et al.25 They observed that maximum adsorption of As(V) occurred in the pH
range of 2–4 with a minimum release of molybdate ions. Boddu
et al.35 used composite chitosan biosorbents
(CCBs) for arsenic removal. Besides, the effect of pH on the adsorption
capacities of As(III) and As(V) by CCB was investigated in detail.

Iron chitosan composite hydrogel was used for the removal of As(III)
and As(V) at pH 7.0 under equilibrium and dynamic conditions. The
effect of other anions on the adsorption of arsenic was also evaluated,
and it was shown that the presence of sulfate, phosphate, and silicate
ions did not cause interference in the adsorption behavior of arsenate/arsenite.
The equilibrium data were fitted to the Langmuir adsorption model,
and the monolayer adsorption capacities of iron chitosan flakes (ICFs)
calculated from the Langmuir model were 22.47 ± 0.56 and 16.15
± 0.32 mg/g for As(V) and As(III), respectively, which are considerably
greater than those of iron chitosan granules (ICBs) 2.24 ± 0.04
mg/g for As(V) and 2.32 ± 0.05 mg/g for As(V) (Figure 2).36

plots for As(III) and As(V) by ICB and ICF. Conditions: concentration

Chitosan has also been used for the preparation of superparamagnetic
magnetic binary oxide particles (MBOPs) via template method for As(III)
removal. The column study was done at two different flow rates (2.0
and 5.0 mL/min). A schematic diagram of the column study for the removal
of As(III) from water is shown in Figure 3a. It was observed that the adsorption rate
constant (K) and adsorption capacity coefficient
(N) were calculated through the logit method37 to be 0.2076 (L/(mg h)) and 1015 (mg/L), respectively,
for the 5.0 mL/min flow rate. Under both dry and wet conditions, MBOP
get attracted toward the magnet, which confirms their magnetic nature,
as shown in Figure 3b.38

The same group also synthesized magnetic binary oxide particles
(MBOPs) using chitosan template for uptake capacity of As(III). It
was demonstrated that the maximum uptake of As(III) was at pH 7.0
and that the equilibrium data were well fitted to the Langmuir and
Freundlich isotherms. No change in the surface morphology was observed
before and after arsenic adsorption (Figure 4), revealing the physical adsorption of arsenic
on the adsorbent.39 Miller et al.40 prepared TiO2-impregnated chitosan
beads (TICBs) for arsenic removal. They revealed that the adsorption
capacity of TICB was influenced by solution pH, TiO2 loading,
and exposure to UV light.

2.2 Sodium Alginate
Sodium alginates
(SA) are naturally derived polysaccharides obtained from brown macroalgae
composed of (1–4)-linked β-d-mannuronic acid
and α-l-guluronic acid monomers. Divalent metal ions
are used to cross-link SA for the fabrication of SA hydrogels. SA-based
sorbents are found to be very effective in removing toxic heavy metals,
such as Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Hg, Pb, Nd, Eu, Yb, and Ra, from water.41,42 Besides, SA microbeads have a great potential for arsenic removal
and can be beneficial for developing countries.43

Akaganeite nanorods of uniform size were prepared
by Cho et al.43 by hydrolysis of ferric
ions in a two-phase system and encapsulating the same in alginate
microbeads for arsenic removal (Figure 5). It was found that the arsenic removal efficiency
could be affected by the akaganeite amount, treatment time, pH, and
microbead size. The lower adsorption of As(III) relative to As(V)
by alginate microbeads can be corroborated to the uncharged nature
of As(III), which led to weaker interactions with positively charged
akaganeite. Nonetheless, the mechanism of arsenic removal and reusability
of the synthesized hydrogel was not discussed.

removal. Reprinted from ref (43) Copyright (2014), with permission from Royal Society of
Chemistry.

El-Sherbiny et al.44 developed calcareous
soil–alginate composites for adsorption of Fe3+,
Mn2+, and As(V) from water. The composites showed the highest
removal efficiency for Fe3+ (100%), followed by Mn2+ (89%) and As(V) (50%). However, the authors did not discuss
the effect of various parameters like pH, temperature desorption,
and reusability of the prepared composite hydrogel. Vu et al.45 reported the synthesis of alginate beads for
As(V) removal by encapsulating magnetic graphene oxide (mGO), as shown
in Figure 6. Besides,
the authors explored the role of cross-linking metal cations in pH
control. The study revealed that As(V) adsorption was not significantly
affected by acidic or basic pH values because of the presence of released
Ca2+, which controlled the local pH when target solution
penetrated the beads.

Ociński et al.46 examined
the
adsorption of chemically pretreated water treatment residuals (WTRs)
with calcium alginate polymer for As(III) and As(V). They studied
the effect of pH on arsenic adsorption by WTR-loaded alginate, and
the results revealed that the adsorption efficiency decreased for
both arsenite and arsenates at pH 7. The adsorption mechanisms of
As(III) and As(V) on Fe–Mn binary oxides are presented in Figure 7.46 Sarkar et al.47 synthesized
low-cost ferric hydroxide microcapsule-loaded alginate beads as an
adsorbent for arsenic removal.

Taken together, the above sections
clearly indicate that the effective
adsorption of arsenic can be achieved by using chitosan- and sodium
alginate-based hydrogels. However, the mechanistic insights involving
magnetic hydrogels are still in the early stage of development. Further,
much effort should be made in this field to prepare highly regenerated
hydrogels selective toward a particular metal ion in a mixture of
other ions with well-defined mechanism action.

2.3 Other
hydrogels Used for Arsenic-Contaminated
Water Treatment
Natural polymers like pectin, cellulose,
and hemicellulose are also being used by several researchers for arsenic
removal. For instance, Fe(II)-loaded pectin hydrogels were prepared
for the adsorption of As(V) from water using three different cross-linkers.
The hydrogels cross-linked with 5% glutaraldehyde showed the maximum
uptake of both Fe(II) and As(V). The effect of pH and temperature
on the adsorption of As(V) was also evaluated. The maximum adsorption
was observed at 35 °C and pH 7.0–9.2.48

Cationic-modified cellulose hydrogel for fluoride
and arsenic adsorption was reported by Meng et al.,49 and the results revealed that the modified hydrogel exhibits
higher adsorption efficiencies for F–, AsO32–, and AsO43– simultaneously
from aqueous solution. Anirudhan et al.50 synthesized iron(III)-coordinated amino-functionalized poly(glycidyl
methacrylate)-grafted cellulose for arsenic(V) adsorption. Hemicellulose-based
hydrogels and their application for the removal of arsenic and chromium
ions were also described in the literature.51 α-Fe2O3-impregnated chitosan beads using
As(III) as imprinted ions were prepared for the adsorption and removal
of As(III) ions from aqueous solutions.52 In another research, Fe and Mn oxides (FMBO) immobilized into a
konjac glucomannan (a kind of polysaccharide)-based aerogel matrix
were prepared to remove As(III) from water.53

3 Challenges of the Current Strategy
Despite the promising future of the bio-based hydrogels in water
remediation, several challenges need to be addressed at the bench
scale so that the strategy can be transferred from lab to commercial
practice. For instance, the effect of pH on the adsorption efficiency
of hydrogel is an important parameter, as this leads to changes in
the surface properties of the hydrogel and the degree of ionization
of the adsorbate molecule. The pH of zero point charge (pHZPC) corresponds
to the pH value at which the surface charge density of an adsorbent
molecule is zero. pHZPC plays a significant role in explaining the
efficiency of the adsorption process in terms of ion attractions from
oppositely charged surfaces. At pH < pHZPC, the adsorbent exhibits
positively charged surface, and at pH > pHZPC, the surface of the
adsorbent exhibits negative charge.54 The
effect of pH on the adsorption efficiency of heavy metal by hydrogels
has been scrutinized by some of the research groups. Mostly, hydrogels
perform in a very small pH range and hence that particular pH has
to be adjusted so that maximum pollutants can be remediated. However,
this study can raise a question on the stability and performance of
bio-based hydrogels in consecutive cycles. Therefore, to reuse bio-based
hydrogels, consideration of the operational pH range is an important
parameter.55

Besides, high adsorption
rate is a significant factor that needs
to be considered from a practical point of view. The bulk hydrogel
takes longer equilibrium time compared to smaller hydrogel particles.
In one report, comparison of bulk hydrogels and small hydrogels was
studied, which revealed that smaller hydrogel particle size decreased
the adsorption time from 2 h to 5 min as the latter have high surface
area, with more exposed site for adsorption of heavy metal.56 However, if the hydrogel particle is too small,
its recovery from the solution is another challenge. The separation
of tiny hydrogel particles through conventional techniques, such as
sedimentation, is ineffective, whereas other methods, such as centrifugation,
are energy-consuming. Recently, it has been demonstrated that if the
hydrogels are embedded with magnetic nanoparticles, they can be separated
from the solution magnetically.22

The hydrogel performance in the presence of different metal ions
is another hindrance for the commercialization of bio-based hydrogel.
The adsorption efficiency of the hydrogel decreases in the presence
of other ions because of the competition created by other metal ions.
Additionally, if other ions like calcium, chlorides, natural organic
matter, sodium, and sulfates are present in higher concentration,
they will compete and adsorb more onto the hydrogel surface and hence
make the recovery process of economic metal ion very tedious. Hence,
a decrease in the adsorption amount of targeted metal ions increases
the regeneration requirements and poses difficulties in situations
where only selective removal of single metal ion is desired. The selectivity
of a hydrogel toward particular metal ions can be made by introducing
specific functional groups. The selectivity of the targeted metal
ion can be enhanced by the introduction of functional groups capable
of forming hydrogen bonds with the targeted metal other than the ions
present.22 However, this area should be
explored more regarding the regeneration and reusability of hydrogels
than hydrogel functionalization.

In addition, recovery of heavy-metal
ions from hydrogel structure,
especially those having high market value, such as nickel, copper,
platinum, gold, phosphorous, etc., should be taken into account. After
recovery, the aforementioned metals can be reused, for example, recovered
chromium metal ion can be used in steel manufacturing, metal finishing,
chemical industries, and so forth. Similarly, recovered phosphorous
ion can be utilized in the fabrication of fertilizers, detergents,
and corrosion inhibitors. For this, magnetic iron oxides method is
desirable because of its cost effectiveness and less energy requirement,
but this method is found to be effective only in acidic environments.57,58 Nonetheless, recovery of arsenic metal ions from hydrogel is not
profitable because of the hazardous effect on the environment. Hence,
recovered arsenic metal ions should be encapsulated through solidification/stabilization
processes with long-term stability and minimal leaching effect, which
makes the toxic waste safer prior to arsenic disposal.59

Finally, the research should be concentrated
on reusing the bio-based
hydrogels by desorbing the heavy metals and retrieving the adsorption
capacity in consecutive cycles so that the complete treatment becomes
extra cost-effective and sustainable. Mainly, adsorption of pollutants
is achieved by two types of reactor: (i) fixed-bed reactor (hydrogel
in particle form) and (ii) stirred tank reactor (hydrogels suspended
in solution). However, fixed-bed reactor is not a good choice because
of clogging, compaction, and pressure drop problems, whereas in stirred
tank reactor, separation of the hydrogel from the solution after adsorption
or desorption process is a major challenge.60 Again the separation of hydrogel depends on the particle size of
the same. If the hydrogel particles are of micro or nanoscale, then
the separation is difficult through conventional techniques, and the
centrifugation process makes it energy-consuming and costly. For the
recovery of hydrogel particles from the solution, fabricating magnetic
hydrogels is more feasible because it is highly selective, fast, and
environmentally friendly compared to other techniques. Various kinds
of iron oxide nanoparticles like Fe3O4 and γ-Fe2O3 exhibit high saturation magnetization values
and hence can be used for the synthesis of magnetic hydrogels.22 However, nanosized magnetic hydrogel particles
need stronger magnetic field compared to microzised particles because
of several influences taking place in nanoform like drag, gravitational,
buoyancy, etc. Moreover, as particle size increases, the adsorption
efficiency decreases because of the decrease in the surface-to-volume
ratio. Hence, the optimum magnetic hydrogel particles should be fabricated
to maintain the balance between the adsorption capacity and magnetic
separation.11,22 A schematic representation of
the overall challenges that need to be focused for the commercialization
of the biopolymer hydrogel is given in Figure 8.

4 Conclusions
and Future Perspectives
Nowadays, energy and water are the
two most important challenges
that we face in our society. Sustainable, low-cost supply of clean
water to the society is crucial for global prosperity and health.
Adsorption technology is expected to play an important role in water
remediation because it is both cost-effective and energy-efficient.
To achieve this, biopolymer-based hydrogels is the most promising
alternative to the conventional sorbents for removing one of the main
contaminants, arsenic, from water. A new avenue can be opened for
solving the environmental and energy problems by using the natural
polymer hydrogels for heavy-metal adsorption to maintain social sustainable
development. Hydrogels prepared from SA, pectin, chitosan, and cellulose
have attracted attention from both academic and industrial points
of view as these polymers are less expensive, biocompatible, and biodegradable
in nature. Besides the comprehensive “green” utilization
of these materials, it also provides the possibilities of preparation
of various advanced materials, which can replace the synthetic polymers.
The future of hydrogels in water remediation is somewhat bright but
needs the collaborative efforts of both government and nongovernment
sectors to develop some sustainable and scale-up innovative approaches
to supply clean drinking water to the society. This perspective article
connotes that this field of research has enough space, which should
be covered in the near future, and hopefully, the laboratory-scale
research should be transferred to industrial scale. Further, smart
hydrogel materials can act as a new generation of adsorbing material
by incorporating functional nanomaterials, for example, graphene oxide
(GO), carbon nanotubes, and so forth. While fabricating hydrogel-based
adsorbent, several important parameters need to be addressed, such
as pore size, surface charge, and understanding the interactions between
adsorbent and adsorbate. Scientists should develop hydrogels with
high selectivity toward a particular metal ion besides recovering
the adsorbed metal for reuse in various sectors. In addition, a hydrogel
should be stable in consecutive cycles of treatment from economic
and sustainability points of view.

To this end, disposal of
arsenic waste is a major problem in developing
countries like India. It is also one of the main barriers for the
successful implementation of available technologies for arsenic removal.
Ideally, arsenic should be disposed in an environment without any
further risk of environment contamination. Available methods for arsenic
disposal are landfills, cow dung mixing, stabilization, anaerobic
digesters, and soil disposal. Future research should be directed to
develop some innovative methods that may provide a final solution
for the arsenic waste disposal problem even in nonlandfill areas.
In this context, green hydrogels have promising future and should
be researched upon in this direction to cater safe and clean drinking
water to our ever-growing population.
