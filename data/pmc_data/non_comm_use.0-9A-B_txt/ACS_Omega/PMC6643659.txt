Simple
procedures to estimate Hansen solubility parameter (HSP)
components from structural formulas are investigated. The best results
are obtained using a simple relationship with molar volume and refractivity
for the dispersion component, and using additivity models based on
tailored fragments specifically designed for the polar and hydrogen
bonding components. Despite large errors for some classes of chemicals,
including small inorganic molecules, ionic liquids, and high halogen
compounds, these models yield average absolute deviations from reference
on par with state-of-the-art models and lower than reported using
molecular dynamics simulations or nonlinear quantitative structure–property
relationship models based on a limited set of quantum chemical descriptors.
In contrast to group contribution methods that are either more restricted
in scope or heavily parameterized, they are thoroughly validated and
very easy to apply. Furthermore, the errors observed are easy to rationalize
and may usually be anticipated. This work sheds light on some limitations
inherent to pure additivity approaches for HSP prediction and provides
a first step toward better models. A Python script implementing the
procedure and the fully detailed results are provided as the Supporting
Information.

1 Introduction
Hansen
solubility parameters (HSPs) have a long history.1,2 Initially
developed as a practical guide for the selection of solvents
in coating systems,3,4 they are presently used in diverse
fields such as pharmaceutical chemistry,5,6 dentistry,7 molecular biology,8 civil engineering,9 vapor sensing10 and optical sensing,11 food science,12 or waste treatment.13 Although new needs for such parameters arise
from growing environmental concerns,6 many
present applications regarding processes in microelectronics14 and nanotechnology,15,16 as well as systems presently focusing much attention such as organogels17 or ionic liquids.18 Beyond solvent selection,19 HSPs now
find widespread applications for a growing number of related problems
involving mixing or diffusion phenomena, including swelling behavior,20,21 intestinal drug absorption properties,22 studies of the morphology of polymer films,23 prediction of environmental stress cracking in plastics,24 optimization of polymer additives, including
stabilizers, antistatic agents, fire retardants,25,26 or plasticizers aimed at improving the performance of binders for
explosives or propellants.27

The
HSP approach relies on the partition of the total cohesive
energy E into dispersive, polar, and hydrogen bonding
contributions, according to E = Ed + Ep + Eh. The three HSP components δd, δp, and δh are defined in terms of these three
energetic contributions as δk =
(Ek/Vm)1/2, where Vm is the molar volume.
The total solubility parameter δ = (E/Vm)1/2 is related to the individual
components through δ2 = δd2 + δp2 + δh2. Unfortunately, although E (and thus δ) may be derived from thermodynamic studies,
this is not the case for the individual components δk which are not measurable quantities. Therefore,
the experimental derivation of HSP data is especially tedious, requiring
extensive measurements associated with the concept of a solubility
sphere.2 In this context, predictive models
are of much interest. Many procedures have been put forward to derive
HSP data without experiments.28−40 However, they all exhibit limitations.

Some of them, including
the Hoy additivity scheme34 or procedures
based on molecular simulations,28 yield
values that are not consistent with the
original HSP reference data.41 The derivation
of HSP components from simulations based on analytical intermolecular
potentials might appear especially attractive as most force fields
rely on similar decomposition of E into dispersive,
polar, and hydrogen bonding contributions. Unfortunately, this approach
is not consistent with the standard HSP data. For instance, it predicts
that δh is zero for any aprotic solvent, due to the
lack of labile protons to form hydrogen bonds in the pure fluid. Actually,
such solvents may exhibit significant values of δh as they can play the role of a proton acceptor and form hydrogen
bonds when mixed with another fluid. For example, a value as high
as 15.4 MPa1/2 is reported for formaldehyde.2 This discrepancy between HSP predictions based
on empirical force fields and accepted experimental values stems from
the fact that A–B interactions between two different species
A and B are not well represented in this case as an average of A–A
and B–B interactions. On the other hand, HSPs being primarily
a tool for engineers and experimental researchers, resorting to molecular
simulations to estimate their values is not practical.

In fact,
current approaches consist either of heavily parameterized
group contribution (GC) or quantitative structure–property
relationship (QSPR) methods, including models based on state-of-the-art
machine learning (ML) techniques.42 A physically
consistent GC method should decompose each cohesive energy component Ek into additive contributions associated with
specific moieties G (either atoms or groups of atoms) on the molecule 1  where NG is the
number of occurrences of group G in the compound. Unfortunately, available
models based on this approach are restricted to the most common chemical
moieties owing to the limited amount of data considered for their
parameterization.29−33

In recent years, more general relationships have been put
forward
to estimate HSPs using group contribution (GC) methods.35−38 Stefanis and Panayiotou (SP) introduced a specially popular method,36 implemented in a commercial software named HSPiP.43 Notwithstanding their parameterization against
extensive data including many different chemical groups, the SP relationships
exhibit distinctive features compared with earlier methods. First,
they rely on first and second order group contributions denoted as Cki and Dkj, respectively. The former are in fact UNIFAC groups,
whereas the latter are defined according to the ABC framework44 in an attempt to capture nonlocal effects associated
with conjugation.45 Secondly, every HSP
component δk is directly expressed
as a linear function of the number of occurrences of the different
first and second order groups, denoted as i and j, respectively 2  In eq 2, k = d, p, h, Ck0 is an empirical constant, Cki and Dkj are the contributions of first
and second order groups to δk. Finally, Ni, and Mj are the
occurrences of groups i and j in
the molecule. Another method introduced by Marrero and Gani introduces
third order groups l, with occurrences of Ol and associated parameters Dkl.46 This method was recently applied
to HSP prediction,35,37 according to 3  Although they
might yield better fits than eq 1 for the training sets
considered, eqs 2 and 3 are inconsistent with the definition of the HSP
components as size-intensive quantities. This necessarily restricts
their predictive value. In recent years, a new approach called Y-MB
arising from extensive work on HSPs has been introduced in the HSPiP
software.39,40 Unfortunately, the details of this model
have not been published. Although the scarcity of the data do not
allow to draw definite conclusions, results reported in the literature
suggest that HSP components obtained using either the SP or Y-MB models
exhibit a similar reliability.47

It must be emphasized that such models rely on extensive parameterizations.
Furthermore, for δp and δh, the
SP model relies on distinct parameter sets depending on whether their
actual value is smaller or larger than 3 MPa1/2. The need
for different parameter sets probably reflects an inadequacy of a
linear relationship such as eq 2. All in all, the SP scheme requires 113 parameters to fit
344 δd values, and 156 parameters to fit either 350
δh values or 375 δp values. Similarly,
the model of Modarresi et al. was fitted against 1050 compounds using
slightly less than 300 parameters. They usually fit the training data
very well, confirming that the predictive value of such methods would
require further validation, at least through cross-validation, as
most experimental data at hand is used to fit many parameters involved
and it is difficult to find additional data to compile an external
test set.

Instead of increasing the number of groups, another
possibility
to introduce additional flexibility is to consider more general QSPR
models like artificial neural networks (ANNs) or other ML techniques.
Interesting models are commercially available from COSMOlogic GmbH,
especially an approach in which HSP values for any compound are obtained
from its simulated activity coefficients (using the COSMO-RS model48) in a predefined set of 29 reference solvents.49 Another attractive QSPR model for HSPs is an
ANN taking quantum chemical descriptors as input.38 This method is very interesting as it successfully handles
very different compounds, including ionic liquids and organic salts.
However, it requires specialized software to compute the descriptors
and implement the ANN, in addition to significant computing resources.
Moreover, the purely empirical nature of ANNs makes it difficult to
derive systematic improvement. Very recently, a systematic study provided
deeper insight into the potential of ML techniques for HSP prediction.42 However, in view of their empirical nature and
reliance on numerous parameters, GC and QSPR models may hardly be
used as a basis for further development.

Therefore, the present
paper investigates simpler procedures to
estimate the HSP data, based on more straightforward schemes to split
molecules into additive fragments, and extensively validated against
external data. The following section reports the general strategy
adopted in this work and results of a preliminary study aimed at identifying
suitable systematic fragmentation levels to represent molecules as
collections of additive fragments. The next ones describe more successful
models obtained on the basis of tailored fragmentation schemes for
the dispersion, polar, and hydrogen bonding HSP components and report
the corresponding results. For convenience, units are not explicitly
mentioned throughout the sequel. Implicit units are MPa1/2 for HSP components, kJ mol−1 for energy components,
and cm3 mol–1 for molar volumes and refractivities.

2 Present Strategy
2.1 Reference Data
2.1.1 Source of Data
Like most recent
predictive schemes, the present methods are fitted and validated using
the HSP data compiled in the Hansen handbook.2 However, it should be kept in mind that most data reported in this
compilation are estimated values. In this work, the procedures introduced
were fitted using only experimentally confirmed data (reported in
bold characters in the handbook), including 90 entries obtained from
the literature in addition to the data gathered from industrial experience.2,3,50,51 After removing mixtures and compounds for which some data is lacking,
a data set made of 174 compounds is obtained. In addition, the present
predictions are systematically compared to accepted reference estimates
compiled in the Hansen handbook for 769 other compounds, hereafter
referred to as the test set.

2.1.2 Uncertainties
on Reference Data
HSPs are primarily used to obtain qualitative
conclusions regarding
the compatibility of various
species or the ability of solvents to dissolve a given material. It
is important to keep in mind that quantitative HSP values exhibit
significant uncertainties, especially if the estimated data are considered.
For instance, among 1188 compounds for which the HSP data have been
compiled on a website,52 16 have multiple
sets of components reported, including water, carbon tetrachloride,
trinitrotoluene, ethylene glycol, or dimethyl ether. The differences
between the maximal and minimal values reported for any HSP component
exhibit root mean square values of 1.3, 4.5, and 7.8 for δd, δp, and δh, respectively
(or 1.1 and 4.6 for δd and δh if
water is excluded). The large uncertainties for δp arise mainly from symmetric compounds, where the dipole moments
associated with polar groups mutually cancel, as for carbon tetrachloride
(δp values ranging from 0.0 to 8.3), trinitrotoluene
(δp values ranging from 3.5 to 10.0), or 1,4-dioxane.
In each case, the value derived from the dipole moment (e.g., using
the Hansen–Beerbower equation) is much smaller than an alternative
value derived from group contributions. Not surprisingly, the large
inconsistencies between δh values are observed for
compounds with strong hydrogen bonds, like urea (δh values ranging from 16 to 26.4) or methanol clusters (δh values ranging from 10 to 22.3). However, significantly different
δh values are also observed for other compounds.
For instance, values ranging from 0 to 6 are reported for bromotrichloromethane.

Valuable insight into uncertainties on experimental data may be
obtained from a comparison of HSP values derived using either conventional
methods or an equation of state model.53 Typical differences between experimental HSP values derived using
distinct procedures are 0.7–0.8 for δd and
δp, and 0.16 for δh, suggesting
that the hydrogen bonding component is more accurately defined than
the dispersion and polar components.

2.1.3 Partition
into Training and Test Sets
Each model for a given HSP component k = d, p, h is actually fitted
against a subset of the 174 compounds for which an experimental value
of δk is available. Indeed, some
compounds are excluded as lying outside the applicability domain (AD)
of the method, owing to under-represented chemical moieties or types
of compounds. In practice, for the three HSP components, ionic liquids,
inorganic compounds (i.e., those with no C atom), and molecules with
less than two H atoms are assumed to lie outside the applicability
domain (AD) of the present models. For δp, molecules
with under-represented polar groups are also assumed to lie outside
the model, including compounds with aromatic C–N, C–S,
or C–O bonds, sulfones, isocyanates and isothiocyanates, carbon
dioxide, F-, I-, and B-containing molecules, molecules with S–H
or Si–H bonds. Finally, although the model for δd appears to be especially general as it does not rely on fragment
contributions, especially underestimated values were obtained for
the two only fluorinated compounds in the training set, namely 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol
and 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexafluorohexan-1-ol, whereas the results obtained
for F-containing compounds from the test set are in good agreement
with previous estimates. Therefore, these two compounds are assumed
to lie outside the AD of the model for δd. Finally,
the exact partition of the data into training set, test set, and outliers
depends on the HSP component and model under consideration. The partitions
associated with the models eventually retained may be obtained from Table S1 in the Supporting Information (SI).

2.2 Modeling Methodology
In view of the
tendency of recent GC models for HSPs to rely on increasingly complex
fragmentation schemes, and of the current preference for linear expressions
for HSP components like 4  instead of the more theoretically appealing eq 1, we started this work
with a comparison of systematic fragmentation schemes of increasing
complexity, using both eqs 1 and 4. The exact fragmentation algorithms
and the corresponding results are detailed in Section S1 (SI). For δd and δp, a performance comparable to that of the SP model36 could only be obtained using as many as 62 distinct atom
types. However, the models thus obtained are of limited practical
interest as they are applicable to only about 30% of the data set.
Their applications to the remaining of 70% would require additional
parameters that cannot be derived from the presently available data.
The use of the Hansen–Beerbower equation for δp was also considered (Section S2). This
approach proves to be of similar accuracy to heavily parameterized
additivity schemes. However, it is not practical in view of its dependence
on the dipole moment.

In view of the experimental uncertainties
discussed in Section 2.1.2, there is no point in striving to match the reference data
through extensive parameterization. Therefore, this work focuses on
simple and practical models whose performance arise from stronger
physical grounds compared to the available additivity methods. In
particular, a feature shared by all recent HSP prediction methods
is the fact that they do not explicitly involve the molar volume Vm. Actually, there appears to be no reason to
not take advantage of this property as it is available for most synthesized
compounds on the market and may otherwise be easily evaluated to within
a few percents from experiment.54−56 On the other hand, additive contributions
to Ep/Eh are
introduced only for groups with heteroatoms/proton acceptors or donors.
For the dispersion component Ed, all atoms
must in principle be considered. As a result, Ed scales roughly linearly with Vm and it proves quite challenging to quantitatively predict the difference
in δd values within a set of compounds. Therefore,
instead of a fragment-based approach for δd, we start
from the London equation for the dispersion interaction between two
atoms A and B 5  where αA and αB are the atom polarizabilities and R the
interatomic distance.57 By analogy, the
dispersion interaction between two molecules within a pure phase may
be assumed to be given by the product of their polarizabilities (or
equivalently, of their molar refractivities) divided by an effective
intermolecular distance Re 6  where RD is the
molar refractivity of the molecule derived from a simple additivity
model.58 However, determining a suitable
value for Re is difficult for two reasons.
First, the interatomic distance between nonspherical molecules is
ill-defined. Secondly, Re in eq 6 actually reflects an average distance
arising from all surrounding molecules interacting with the central
one. Dimensional analysis suggests either 7  if the molecules are viewed as spherical,
or 8  if Ed is assumed
to be determined by close contact interactions between neighboring
atoms, with an interatomic distance that does not depend on the overall
molecular volume, but rather on the van der Waals radii of the atoms.
To accommodate both eqs 7 and 8, the following expression was first
assumed 9  This simple three-parameter model
already
yields fair performance. However, the fit and cross-validation score
turned out to be both further improved by assuming the first term
to be independent on RD and to scale linearly
with Vm, leading to the following expression
for the dispersion HSP component 10  

2.3 Fragmentation Algorithms
The fragmentation
scheme is critical to the success of any additivity method. A too
crude distinction, e.g., using atomic contributions that do not depend
on the atomic environment, is clearly unlikely to provide accurate
results. On the other hand, overly cautious distinctions lead to an
excessive number of possibly ill-defined parameters. Group contribution
methods reported previously use similar sets of standard groups (such
as UNIFAC groups) for all three HSP components. This approach is probably
not optimal since these components arise from different interactions.
For instance, although dispersion forces involve all atoms, Coulomb
interactions are insignificant in the lack of heteroatoms, whereas
hydrogen bonding requires the presence of labile protons. Therefore,
δd, δp, and δh probably
require distinct fragmentation schemes. Since eq 10 proves satisfactory for δd, fragmentation schemes are required only for δp and δh.

2.3.1 Contributing Fragments
for the Polar Component
Instead of systematically assigning
a fixed Ep contribution to every fragment
in a molecule, the observation
that δp = 0 for alkanes suggests that hydrogen atoms
and saturated carbon atoms do not contribute to Ep. Non-zero values for δp require strong
Coulomb interactions associated with the presence of heteroatoms and/or
polarization interactions that are especially significant for compounds
with multiple (polarizable) bonds. Therefore, the present additive
contributions are associated with such structural features of the
molecules.

In the first step, only saturated heteroatoms are
considered. Their contribution to Ep is
assumed to depend primarily on their number of hydrogen neighbors.
Thus, the contribution of a saturated heteroatom with symbol X and
bonded to nH hydrogen atoms is simply
denoted as X(HnH).

In the second
step, unsaturated functional groups are considered.
Specific Ep contributions are introduced
for isolated multiple bonds (C=O, C≡N, and P=O)
and for clusters of the adjacent multiple bonds (i.e., the nitro group).
According to this procedure, specific parameters would be needed for
other groups with adjacent multiple bonds, like sulfone or azide.
However, they are not introduced in this study due to the lack of
experimental data to safely determine their values.

Finally,
additional parameters are introduced for specific moieties,
i.e., amide groups, whose polarity is enhanced by the electron transfer
between the nitrogen and oxygen atoms, carboxylic acids, in which
the overall polarity of the group is decreased due to dipoles along
O–H directions opposing the C–O dipoles, and ester and
carbonate groups which are well-known components of polar solvents
for electrolytes.

2.3.2 Contributing Fragments
for the Hydrogen
Bonding Component
Taking advantage of established knowledge
about the hydrogen bonding donor and acceptor moieties, it proves
especially straightforward to obtain a satisfactory model for δh. Within the present data set, hydrogen atoms are bound either
to C, O, or N, and labeled accordingly as HC, HO, and HN. In fact,
special contributions denoted as HN(amide), H2N and HO(COOH)
are introduced for hydrogens in amides, primary amines, and carboxylic
acids, respectively. This yields a total of six descriptors for H-bond
donors. On the other hand, the data set exhibits mainly three potential
proton acceptors: nitrogen (except if in nitro group), oxygen, and
halogen atoms, denoted as N, O, and X, respectively.

2.4 Validation Procedures
The validation
of GC methods and other additivity schemes typically relies on their
ability to fit large datasets using a relatively small number of empirical
parameters. However, since experimental HSP data are available for
only a relatively small number of compounds, it is desirable to use
a more stringent validation procedure. In this work, the predictive
value of the models is estimated from a leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation,
as done recently for ML models.42

In addition, in the lack of an extensive set of experimentally confirmed
HSP data, predictions are made using the present models for the external
test set and compared to previous estimates reported in ref (2). Although the latter are
deemed to be less reliable than genuine experimental values, it must
be stressed that even the latter may exhibit significant uncertainties.
For instance, two conflicting values of respectively 0 and 8.3 MPa1/2 are reported for the polar component of tetrachloromethane
CCl4, depending on whether this value was estimated from
the dipole moment of the molecule (i.e., 0 D) or from group contributions.
Despite the even larger uncertainties to be expected for the test
set, a comparison between the present and earlier estimates is meaningful
as the latter values have been used successfully to draw qualitative
conclusions about practical solubility problems.

The present
predictions are compared with the results obtained
using the state-of-the-art procedures, including a reparametrization
of the GC methods of ref (36) against the present training set (the corresponding procedure
is hereafter referred to as the GC method) and very recent ML models
which were training against a slightly larger trained set of 193 solvents.42

The relative performances of various procedures
are compared using
the average absolute deviation (AAD) from reference values and the
determination coefficient (R2). These
statistical indicators are calculated either for the training set
(reflecting the quality of fit), for the outcome of a cross-validation
against the training set or for the test set (thus reflecting the
predictive value of the method).

3 Results
3.1 Dispersion Component
For δd, the fitting
parameters involved in eq 10 are reported in Table 1. They prove to be statistically well-defined.
Results obtained using this equation are shown in Figure 1. As expected, larger deviations
from reference values tend to be observed for compounds lying outside
the AD (i.e., those represented using white squares). Propylene carbonate,
dimethyl sulfone, and formic acid are the only two compounds from
the training set for which significant deviations from experiment
are observed. Interestingly, the largest discrepancies between the
present and previous estimates tend to arise for compounds with S,
Br, and I atoms.

Figure 1 Presently calculated δd components versus
reference
(experimental or previously calculated) data for compounds in the
training set (dark circles), test set (light circles), and out of
the AD (white squares). Main deviations from reference values are
for (A) propylene carbonate, (B) dimethyl sulfone, (C) formic acid,
(D) tetrathiafulvalene, (E) thiourea, (F) diiodomethane, (G) resorcinol,
(H) 1,1-dibromoethene, (J) 1,1,2,2-tetrabromoethane, and (K) tetraiodothiophene.

c2	75 044	11 350	
All in all, the results are remarkably good considering
the simplicity
of the model. With an AAD of 0.68 derived from the LOO, they are on
par with gpHSP, the recent ML model based on Gaussian processes put
forward by Sanchez-Lengeling et al. and better than any alternative
state-of-the-art ML model considered by these authors.42

In view of their typical magnitude close
to 0.8 (Section 2.1.2), the experimental uncertainties
on reference δd data might appear as the limiting
factor restricting the accuracy of the present and gpHSP predictive
models. However, even better results are obtained using the GC method
(AAD = 0.49 from LOO). This excellent performance might be a matter
of chance. Anyway, according to the literature results, these three
procedures are more reliable than any alternative approach, including
molecular simulations (AAD = 0.98)28 or
the ANN/QSPR model based on quantum calculations (AAD = 1.37),38 although present comparisons with the models
reported in refs (28) and (38) must be
considered with caution as the latter were respectively applied to
polymers and to a significant fraction of compounds beyond the scope
of the present model.

Finally, it is encouraging to observe
that the AAD between earlier
(reported in the Hansen handbook) and present δd estimates
for the test set is 0.75, i.e., only slightly larger than the value
of 0.68 obtained for the training set on the basis of genuine experimental
data.

3.2 Polar Component
The parameters of
the model for δp are compiled in Table 2. HSP data estimated on this
basis are compared to reference values in Figure 2. Despite the very small number of parameters,
some values appear to be statistically ill-defined, especially N(H1)
for N atoms with one H atom attached.

Figure 2 Calculated δp components
versus reference (experimental
or previously calculated) data for compounds in the training set (dark
circles), test set (light circles), and out of the AD (white squares).
Main deviations from reference values are for formamide (A), butyrolactone
(B), picric acid (C), 4-nitrophenol (D), (Z)-1,2,3-trichloro-1-propene
(E), butadiene diepoxide (F), triethanolamine (G), phthalic anhydride
(H), 2(5H)-furanone (J), succinic anhydride (K), biuret (L), fumaronitrile
(M), 2-chloroacetamide and acrylamide (N), TNT and propionamide (O), N-acetylcaprolactam (P), diacetyl (Q), and hexamethylene
tetramine (R).

Similar
to δd, the AAD derived from the LOO against
the training set (2.00) is consistent with the corresponding value
for the test set (2.08), which suggests that it correctly reflects
the predictive value of the model. Accordingly, the present additivity
scheme for δp is slightly less accurate than most
alternatives (GC: 1.75, ANN/QSPR: 1.85, gpHSP: 1.93) except molecular
simulations, which led to a value of 3.84 for the AAD.28

The present model for δp is clearly hampered by
the lack of data to assign all parameters that would be needed for
every specific polar group that may be encountered. The value of δp is especially seriously overestimated for picric acid, as
the calculated value of 20.3 is dramatically larger than the reference
value of 7. A similar overestimation is observed for trinitrotoluene
(18.5 instead of 10). Such deviations clearly arise because the contributions
of the nitro groups to the overall dipole moment of the molecule cancel
each other, a cancellation that is not taken into account by any additivity
scheme.

Another interesting case is hexamethylene tetramine,
a cage molecule
for which the dipole moment is expected to be zero for symmetry reasons,
leading to a null value of δp according to the Hansen–Beerbower
equation.29 In the present model, the contribution
of any tertiary amine to Ep is zero within
statistical uncertainty. Therefore, the predicted value of δp is zero as well. However, the reference value reported in
the Hansen handbook for this molecule is as high as 11.6.

In
fact, taking advantage of quantum chemically derived electrostatic
descriptors is an alternative that appears especially attractive for
the polar HSP component, as it is in principle fully determined by
the charge distribution. The significance of such descriptors for
this specific component was empirically confirmed by Sanchez-Lengeling
et al.42

3.3 Hydrogen
Bonding Component
The parameters
of the present model for δh based on eq 1 are compiled in Table 3. As expected, the contribution
of protons bonded to O atoms is especially large, whereas it is very
small for hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon. The latter parameter is
in fact ill-defined. However, setting its value to zero would significantly
affect the performance of the model in view of the large number of
hydrogens bonded to C atoms in organic compounds.

The performance
of the resulting model is illustrated in Figure 3. Not surprisingly,
the fit is not as good as for more extensively parametrized models.
However, the AAD values of 1.55 and 1.67 derived, respectively, from
the LOO against the training set and from the application of the model
to the test set are quite satisfactory compared to alternative methods
(gpHSP: 1.57, GC: 1.95, ANN/QSPR: 2.58, molecular simulations: 5.96).
Specially large errors are observed for small hydrogen bonded compounds
clearly outside the AD of the model, like hydrazine (H2N–NH2) or phosphoric acid (H3PO4).

Figure 3 Calculated δh components versus reference (experimental
or previously calculated) data for compounds in the training set (dark
circles), test set (light circles), and out of the AD (white squares).
Main deviations from reference values are for 2-butanone oxime (A),
1-phenyl-2-methylamino-1-propanol (B), succinic anhydride (C), N-methylformamide (D), formaldehyde (E), picric acid (F),
thiourea (G), tetrahydrothiophene, methyl mercaptan, and tetrathiafulvalene
(H), methyl peroxide (J), dl-lactic acid (K), hydroquinone
(L), acetylene and vinyl acetylene (M), thiophenol (N), and N-methylaniline (O).

3.4 Discussion
Although the present models
might appear to lack reliability considering all presently obtained
results, the most significant errors may be anticipated on the basis
of simple physical or statistical considerations. Focusing on standard
organic compounds that may be described as functionalized hydrocarbon
backbones, and excluding other compounds (with no/few H, C atoms,
or unusual polar groups), an accuracy on par with the state-of-the-art
techniques is obtained on the basis of only a handful of adjustable
parameters.

An obvious drawback of the present models, especially
for δp and δh, is the fact that
they are restricted to the most common functional groups. However,
similar restrictions apply to any fragment-based model. The apparent
reliability of sophisticated GC methods probably arises to some extent
as a consequence of the numerous parameters involved, and their predictive
value would probably prove lower than suggested by the good fit reported
in the literature, although the present investigation confirms the
superiority of the GC model of Stefanis and Panayiotou for the polar
component.36

4 Conclusions
The present work reports extremely simple and widely applicable
procedures allowing pencil and paper estimation of the dispersion,
polar, and hydrogen bonding components of the Hansen solubility parameters,
using only 3, 13, and 9 fitting parameters, respectively. The simplicity
of the model for the dispersion component, taking advantage of molar
refractivity and volume, is especially remarkable.

A close examination
of the results shows that the applicability
domain of these procedures is fairly broad and well-defined in terms
of molecular structural features. With the exception of the polar
component for which a previously established group contribution method
should prove more reliable in view of its extensive parameterization,
other HSP components are predicted with about state-of-the art-reliability
from the present models. Reliable results may also be obtained for
the dispersion component for standard organic compounds not belonging
to the categories presently identified as lying beyond the applicability
domain of the method. These results are encouraging in view of future
development.

In contrast to previously available additivity
methods for HSPs,
the present models are based on tailored and physically motivated
procedures to split molecules into fragments, fitted against a comprehensive
set of experimental data and validated against an extensive test set
of previously estimated values. In contrast, other recent models,
like SP or Y-MB, involve many empirical parameters whose determination
requires that the whole database compiled in the Hansen handbook2 be used. This has two disadvantages. First, most
values included in this large training set are estimated rather than
measured, which can lead to significant uncertainties in their values.
Secondly, as most published HSP data are included in this training
set, this only allows the model to be validated on a very limited
external test set.

The fact that introducing the molar refractivity
leads to better
models for the dispersion component demonstrates that the relative
scarcity of data for HSP components can be circumvented by the use
of related ancillary properties easier to estimate, as a result of
greater simplicity or more extensive data at hand. For instance, the
fact that Hansen’s original derivations were based around total
cohesive energy density (which may be obtained for much larger datasets
than available for HSP data), as follows naturally from their founding
theory, suggests that it might prove fruitful for improved hand-based
methods to take advantage of the database values.

Regarding
the polar component, the inability of the present model
to provide data consistent with previously established values for
compounds with a low polarity arising from polar groups pointing to
opposite directions is a limitation inherent to additivity schemes.
Using three-dimensional models for every rigid substructure encountered
and/or considering explicit charge distributions might provide a road
to better predictions.
