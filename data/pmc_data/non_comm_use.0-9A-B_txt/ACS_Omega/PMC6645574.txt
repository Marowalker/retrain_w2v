We
mimic a living system wherein target molecules permeate through
capillary and cells for chemical transformation. A monolithic porous
gel (MPG) was easily prepared by copolymerization of gel matrix, tertiary
amine, and cross-linking monomer in one-step synthesis. Interconnected
capillaries existed in the MPG, enabling flow application with high
permeability. Because the capillaries were constituted of polymer
gel, Pd(0)-loaded MPG provided another permeable pathway to substrates
in a gel network, contributing to its much high turnover number after
30 days of use, compared with that of Pd(0)-loaded inorganic supports.
Interestingly, the gel network size of the MPG influenced the catalytic
frequency. Diffusivities of the substrates and product in the gel
networks increased with increasing network sizes in relation to catalytic
activities. The MPG strategy provides a universal reactor design in
conjunction with a practical process and precisely controlled reaction
platform.

Introduction
Process innovations
for chemical syntheses impact growth in chemical
industries. Highly efficient chemical manufacture has motivated the
development of batch and continuous-flow systems. Flow syntheses have
several advantages over batch syntheses, in terms of productivity,
heat and mixing efficiency, reproducibility, and operability.1−4 Moreover, large-scale production is easily achieved by increasing
the size or number of flow reactors.5,6 Chemical manufacture
requires a high-quality synthesis with excellent system operability.
In this regard, the development of highly efficient flow reactors
with a sophisticated synthetic design is desirable.

Designs
for chemical syntheses and practical devices could result
in advanced flow reactors. Taking inspiration from an evolved, natural,
and efficient flow reactor, we mimic a living system where flow syntheses
is processed smoothly through capillaries.7 Nowadays, many flow reactors that possess capillary arrangements
have been proposed for chemical syntheses.8−12 Although this approach has succeeded and attracted
inquisitive attention in the industrial field, the fabrication of
integrated capillaries requires complicated and cost-consuming micromachining
techniques. A monolithic porous material, in which capillaries are
integrated three-dimensionally, has been proposed.13 A single piece of porous material can be prepared in any
desired shape in a one-step synthesis, and easily scaled up. Additionally,
its porous property and chemical functionality are also precisely
controllable.14 Fréchet and Svec
have developed many monolithic porous polymers and demonstrated their
feasibilities in flow applications.15−32 In the living system, substrates can be transported through not
only the capillaries but also cells comprising the wall of the capillaries.
The cells provide a reaction platform in their internal space. Thus,
in the living system, the substrates can fully permeate throughout
a body. If the wall of capillary in the monolithic porous polymer
is also permeable to target molecules, its internal space could be
provided as a reaction platform in a fashion similar to that of the
living system. Such a hierarchical permeability (through capillaries
and cells)33 facilitates flow operation
and enlarges a space available to a chemical transformation within
the limited volume of the flow reactor. However, the hierarchical
permeability of the target molecules have not been considered in a
flow synthesis yet.

We previously developed a poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)
(PNIPAm)-based monolithic porous gel (MPG) as a flow reactor for a
Pd-catalyzed Suzuki coupling reaction.34 Capillaries existed in the MPG as interspatial pores, contributing
to successful application in the flow system. A reaction platform
was provided in the gel network by the loading of Pd(0), affording
a Pd(0)-loaded MPG (Pd/MPG). The Pd/MPG should contain two different
pathway scales for the substrates and product (Figure 1). First, the feed solution containing the
substrates flows continuously through capillaries in the Pd/MPG. Next,
the substrates easily diffuse into the walls of the capillaries that
are composed of a gel. Molecular diffusivities into a gel network
are well maintained owing to the flexibility of the polymer chain.
Therefore, if catalysts are immobilized in the gel network, the substrates
can easily access the catalysts and are transformed smoothly, giving
a desired product. Finally, the product diffuses out of the gel network.
This MPG strategy would be a key to fabricate the hierarchically permeable
structure in a catalytic flow reactor.

Figure 1 Conceptual illustration
of a flow reactor using monolithic porous
gel (MPG) for the catalytic reaction.

Herein, we investigated the performance of flow reactors
using
Pd/MPGs with different gel network sizes. A set of Pd/MPGs with different
gel network sizes was prepared. The Pd/MPGs were applied to a flow
Suzuki coupling reaction as a model system to demonstrate their advantages
over other types of inorganic supports (porous glass membrane, silica
particles, or carbon). Using Pd/MPGs with different gel network sizes,
the influence of the gel network on molecular transport under flow
conditions was also investigated.

Experimental Section
Reagents
Water with a conductivity of 18.2 MΩ
cm (Milli-Q, Millipore Co., Bedford, MA) was used in all experiments.
NIPAm (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., Osaka, Japan), N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)methacrylamide (DMAPM, Tokyo Chemical
Industry Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide (BIS, Tokyo Chemical Industry Co.,
Ltd.), and 2,2′-azobis(2-amidinopropane)dihydrochloride (AAPD,
Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd.) were used as the gel matrix, tertiary
amine ligand, cross-linker, and radical initiator, respectively. NIPAm
was purified by recrystallization from benzene/n-hexane
and dried in vacuo at room temperature. The polymerization inhibitor
in DMAPM was removed using an activated alumina column. The porous
glass membrane (mean pore size: 2000 nm, 20 mmϕ, SPG Technology
Co. Ltd., Miyazaki, Japan) and silica particles (particle size: 40–63
μm, Merck Co., Darmstadt, Germany) were tertiary-aminated using
a procedure similar to that previously reported.35 K2PdCl4 (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis,
MO) and NaBH4 (Tokyo Chemical Industry Co. Ltd.) were used
to prepare Pd(0)-loaded supports. Pd-loaded carbon (Pd/C, Wako Pure
Chemical Industries Ltd.) was also used as a referential Pd catalyst.
Phenylboronic acid (1, Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.),
4-bromobenzoic acid (2, Tokyo Chemical Industry Co.,
Ltd.), and Na2CO3 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries
Ltd.) were used to prepare the substrate stock solution. 4-Phenylbenzoic
acid (3, Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.) was used
to prepare a standard solution of the Suzuki coupling product for
calibration.

Preparation and Characterization of MPGs
MPGs were
prepared by the copolymerization of NIPAm, DMAPM, and cross-linking
monomer BIS in water (Scheme 1a, described in detail in the Supporting Information).34,36 MPGs with different gel network
sizes were synthesized with a fixed feed ratio of DMAPM (10 mol %)
and different feed ratios of BIS (5, 10, or 30 mol % for MPG1, 2, or 3). After washing with sufficient
water and lyophilizing, the yields of the dried MPGs were >97%.
Differences
among gel network sizes for MPG1–3 were confirmed by evaluating the swelling properties of the MPGs
in water (see Supporting Information).
Tertiary-aminated porous glass membrane and silica particles were
also prepared (described in detail in the Supporting Information).

Preparation
of Pd(0)-Loaded Supports
Pd/MPGs were prepared
by Pd(II)-ion adsorption and subsequent reduction into Pd(0) using
K2PdCl4 and NaBH4 (Scheme 1b, described in detail in the Supporting Information).34 Differences among gel network sizes for Pd/MPG1–3 were also confirmed in the same manner as mentioned above.
The Pd/MPGs were lyophilized and their internal structures were observed
using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, SU8000,
Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Before observation,
the MPG surfaces were coated with platinum (thickness: approx. 4 nm)
using an auto fine coater (JFC-1600, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The
porous properties of the Pd/MPGs were also evaluated using mercury
intrusion porosimetry (AutoPoreIV9520, Micromeritics Instrument Co.,
Norcross, GA). Pd(0) loaded in the MPGs was observed using transmission
electron microscopy (TEM, TECNAI 20, Philips FEI, Netherlands). The
Pd/MPGs were then immersed in aqua regia for 24 h, and the eluent
was analyzed using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy
(ICP-AES, ICPS-8100, Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) to estimate
the amount of Pd loaded (qPd), which was
defined as follows 1  where VM and ν
are the bulk volume of the MPGs and the volume of solution, respectively,
and subscript E indicates the eluent. Pd(0)-loaded nonporous gel (Pd/nonporous
gel), porous glass membrane (Pd/porous glass membrane), silica particles
(Pd/silica particles), and Pd/C were also evaluated in the same manner
(see Supporting Information).

Suzuki Coupling
Reactions in the Flow System
Suzuki
coupling reactions of 1 and 2 (Scheme 1c) were conducted
using Pd/MPG1–3, Pd/porous glass
membrane, Pd/silica particles, and Pd/C in the flow system. All flow
operations were carried out in an incubator at 30 °C. The Pd(0)-loaded
supports were packed into the homemade column with a support screen
(0.45 μm Omnipore, Millipore Co., Billerica, MA), then attached
to the flow apparatus (Scheme 1d), syringe pump (YSP-101, YMC Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan), and
pressure gauge (KDM-30, Krone Co., Tokyo, Japan) in a thermocontrolled
incubator at 30 °C. The water permeabilities of the columns were
preliminarily examined to obtain permeation coefficients using Darcy’s
law (kD) (described in detail in the Supporting Information). After conditioning the
reactor using aqueous Na2CO3 solution, 1 (10 mmol L–1) and 2 (11 mmol
L–1, 1.1 equiv) in aqueous Na2CO3 (11 mmol L–1, 1.1 equiv) solution were
permeated through the reactor at a fixed flow rate for 30 days. The
residence time (τ) of the substrates was around 0.5 h. The eluent
was continuously collected and analyzed using a high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC, LC-2000Plus, JASCO CO., Tokyo, Japan) system
with a reverse phase column (Mightysil RP-18 GP 250-4.6, Kanto Chemical
Co.) and an ultraviolet detector. Acetonitrile and water (50:50) containing
0.1 vol % trifluoroacetic acid was employed as a mobile phase. Turnover
numbers (TONs) of catalysts in the flow system were estimated using
the following equation 2  During substrate permeation, Pd leaching into
the eluent was also confirmed using ICP-AES.

Kinetics Study of the Suzuki
Coupling Reaction Using Pd/MPGs
in the Flow System
Pd/MPG and a support screen were packed
into the homemade column, then attached to the flow apparatus. After
conditioning of the reactor using aqueous Na2CO3 solution, the substrate was pumped into the reactor at various flow
rates. In the period with the short residence time (τ = 0.1
h), turnover frequencies (TOFs) of Pd catalysts in the flow system
were estimated from the reaction rate per amount of Pd catalysts.

Results and Discussion
Properties of Pd/MPGs
A white and
monolithic structure
was obtained from all monomer compositions with different BIS contents
used to prepare MPG1–3. The bulk
volumes of the MPGs changed with temperature, and the thermoresponsiveness
was suppressed by increasing BIS content (Figure S1a). Pd/MPG1–3 was obtained
by Pd(II)-ion adsorption and subsequent reduction into Pd(0).34 The Pd/MPGs were slightly brown (Figure 2a). The bulk volumes and thermoresponsiveness
of the Pd/MPGs were almost identical to those of the original MPGs
(Figure S1b). The internal morphologies
of the Pd/MPGs were observed using FE-SEM (Figures 2b,c, and S2).
The pore sizes in the Pd/MPGs were in the order of several hundred
nanometers and several micrometers (Figure S3 and Table S1). The amounts of Pd loaded in the MPGs were around
1.3–1.5 μmol cm–3 (Table 1). Pd(0) loaded on the MPGs
were observed using TEM, with average Pd(0) sizes of 2.0–2.4
nm in all of the Pd/MPGs (Table 1, Figures 2d and S4a). In a similar manner,
the Pd/porous glass membrane, Pd/silica particles, and Pd/C were also
evaluated (Figure S6, see the Supporting
Information).

of Pd/MPGs.

The bulk volumes
of the MPG1–3 were dependent on temperature,
which was attributed to the phase
transition of PNIPAm as a gel matrix (Figure S1a). The volume-change responsiveness to temperature was suppressed
by increasing the BIS content. The increase in the cross-linker content
in the PNIPAm gel could be regarded as parallel to the decrease in
the gel network size.37 The network sizes
of PNIPAm gels with BIS contents of 5, 10, and 30 mol % were calculated
to be 7.9, 5.2, and 2.8 nm, respectively.38 The gel network sizes of the MPGs were indicated to be controlled
by their BIS contents. The loading of Pd(0) did not affect the bulk
volumes of the Pd/MPGs (Figure S1b), suggesting
that the gel network sizes were conserved. The FE-SEM images showed
that the Pd/MPGs had capillaries as interspatial pores (Figures 2b,c, and S2), which would facilitate the flow system using the Pd/MPGs.
As the average sizes of Pd(0) in the MPGs were smaller or almost equal
to the gel network sizes (Table 1), reaction platforms were expected to be provided
within the gel networks.

Permeabilities of Flow Reactors
Before application
in the flow system, the water permeabilities of support materials
were evaluated. When water permeated through a nonporous gel (Figure S5, see the Supporting Information) at
a flow rate of 100 mL h–1, the pressure loss was
tremendously high and never reached a steady state (Figure S7a). However, water permeation through MPG1 gave moderate pressure losses under the same conditions. Pressure
losses at the steady state proportionally increased with increasing
flow rates (Figure S7b). The kD of MPGs, porous glass membrane, and silica particles
were estimated to be around 10–14–10–13 m2 (Figure 3), which were comparable to those of commercially
available membrane filters with pore sizes ranging from 1000 to 10 000
nm.39 After loading of Pd(0), the kD was in almost of the same order as that of
the original supports (Figures 3 and S7c). Pd/C also showed almost
the same permeability (2.4 × 10–14 m2) as that of porous glass membrane and silica particles.

Figure 3 Permeation
coefficients of support materials before (open rectangle)
and after (filled rectangle) loading of Pd.

The MPG1–3 exhibited their
excellent
permeabilities, which were attributed to the capillaries (Figure S7b). However, water could not permeate
through the nonporous gel (Figure S7a).
Therefore, it was difficult to apply the nonporous gel to a flow process.
As the water permeabilities of the Pd(0)-loaded supports were acceptable
(Figures 3 and S7c), it was expected that Suzuki coupling reactions
could be achieved in the flow system with moderate pressure losses.

Suzuki Coupling Reaction in the Flow System
Pd/MPG1–3, Pd/porous glass membrane, Pd/silica
particles, and Pd/C were applied to the Suzuki coupling reaction between 1 and 2 under flow condition (Scheme 1c). The TONs of Pd(0)-loaded
supports were estimated along with permeation of the substrate at
a fixed flow rate (τ = 0.5 h) for 30 days (Figure 4). In all of the catalysts,
there were no aggregations of Pd(0) observed from TEM images after
the Suzuki coupling reaction (Figures S4b and S6b). Remarkably, the TONs of Pd/MPG1, Pd/MPG2, and Pd/MPG3 were much high to give 2631,
2290, and 1333, respectively, compared with those of the Pd/porous
glass membrane, Pd/silica particles, and Pd/C (65, 144, and 26), respectively.
In addition, Pd leachings from the Pd/MPGs were below the detection
limit of ICP-AES. However, Pd leachings from the Pd/porous glass membrane,
Pd/silica particles, and Pd/C were detected to be 5.0, 2.9, and 1.6%,
respectively.

Figure 4 TONs of Pd(0)-loaded supports and Pd leaching study for
the Suzuki
coupling reaction in the flow system. Reaction conditions: 1 (10 mmol L–1) and 2 (11 mmol L–1, 1.1 equiv) in aqueous Na2CO3 solutions (11 mmol L–1, 1.1 equiv), 30 °C,
τ: 0.5 h, 30 days.

Surprisingly, the productivities of Pd/MPG1–3 were well maintained without any Pd leaching, whereas those
of the Pd/porous glass membrane and Pd/silica particles were lost
during 30 days of use due to Pd leaching (Figure 4). It should be noted that the TONs of the
Pd/porous glass membrane, Pd/silica particles, and Pd/C under batch
condition were much higher (248, 1004, and 720, Table S2, described in detail in the Supporting Information)
than of those under continuous-flow condition (65, 144, and 26). Using
the porous glass membrane, silica particles, and carbon as support
materials, Pd was localized on the surface. The localized Pd was only
accessible to substrates and eluted easily under flow conditions.
The solid–liquid contacting efficiency on the Pd/porous glass
membrane was expected to be higher than that on the Pd/silica particles.40 However, the improved efficiency resulted in
a larger leaching percentage from the Pd/porous glass membrane. Using
the MPGs as support materials, Pd was fully taken up into the gel
networks. A moderate steric hindrance exerted by the polymer chain
allowed effective retention of Pd and fast molecular transport in
the gel network. Also, this MPG strategy was effective for Suzuki
coupling reactions between phenylboronic acid and other aryl halides
(Table S3). Even in the flow system, the
Pd/MPGs conducted chemical synthesis effectively, indicating their
advantages over other types of Pd(0)-loaded supports.

Effect of Gel
Network Size on Pd Catalytic Activity in the Flow
System
Kinetics studies of the Suzuki coupling reaction under
flow conditions were conducted using Pd/MPGs with different BIS contents
(Figure 5). The percentage
conversion into 3 increased with increasing τ of
the substrates. The TOFs of the Pd/MPG1, Pd/MPG2, and Pd/MPG3 were 27.4, 16.1, and 7.8 h–1, respectively (Table 2). Interestingly, the Pd/MPG1 exhibited a 3.5-fold higher
TOF than that of Pd/MPG3.

Figure 5 Kinetics study on the
Suzuki coupling reaction using Pd/MPGs in
the flow system. Reaction conditions: 1 (10 mmol L–1) and 2 (11 mmol L–1, 1.1 equiv) in aqueous Na2CO3 solutions (11
mmol L–1, 1.1 equiv), 30 °C.

b Estimated using nonporous gels with
the same monomer composition as MPGs.

Using Pd/MPG1, the highest TOF was achieved
for the
Suzuki coupling reaction in the flow system (Table 2). The surface areas of capillaries in the
MPGs increased with increasing BIS contents (Table S1), supporting that molecular transport on the surface of
the capillaries was not rate-limiting. The TOFs of the Pd/MPGs were
likely to be dependent on the size of the gel network provided as
a reaction platform.

Diffusivities of Substrates and Product in
the Gel Network
Nonporous gels with different BIS contents
were prepared and tested
for diffusion experiments of 1–3 in
the gels (Figure S8, described in detail
in the Supporting Information). It was found that the diffusion coefficients
(D) of 1–3 in the
gels were comparable to those of small molecules in bulk liquid.41 Moreover, the D increased with
increasing the BIS contents of the nonporous gels (Table 2).

In the gel network,
diffusivities of substrates and product were well maintained because
of the flexible polymer chain of PNIPAm gel. The D values increased with increasing gel network size (Table 2) and were similar to those
previously reported.42−45 If the molecular diffusions in the gel network were rate-limiting
steps in the Suzuki coupling reaction, the D values
would strongly influence catalytic activities, as demonstrated (Figure 5 and Table 2). Molecular diffusion in the
gel network were controlled by tuning the network size. Therefore,
the design of hierarchical permeabilities in a capillary and gel network
were key factors in constructing a highly efficient continuous-flow
reactor for chemical synthesis.

Conclusions
A
flow reactor using the monolithic porous gel, MPG, for chemical
synthesis was proposed. The MPGs had capillaries as interspatial pores,
and the MPG gel network sizes were controlled by tuning a feed ratio
of the cross-linking monomer. The capillaries in the MPG allowed flow
application. The MPGs showed excellent permeabilities comparable with
those of commercially available membrane filters with pore sizes in
the range 1000–10 000 nm. Owing to the moderate steric
hindrance of the gel network, Pd/MPG showed significant stability
and catalytic activity in a Suzuki coupling reaction under flow conditions.
However, little performance was observed in the inorganic supports.
The catalytic activities of the Pd/MPGs were dependent on the gel
network size, which corresponded to the diffusivities of the substrates
and product. The MPG provides an easy and sophisticated strategy for
preparing and functionalizing a flow reactor for chemical synthesis.
In conjunction with a practical process, the MPG would have a significant
impact on the field of current flow reactors. The conceptual design
of a hydrogel network can be extended to a reactor design for chemical
synthesis in a flow system under aqueous media. The concept should
be further extended to other types of flow catalytic reactions using
transition-metal catalysts under flow conditions.
