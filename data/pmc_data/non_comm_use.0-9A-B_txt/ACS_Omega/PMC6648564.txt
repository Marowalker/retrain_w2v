To improve the adsorption capacity, reduce the disposal cost, and
enhance the separation efficiency of common activated carbon as an
adsorbent in wastewater treatment, a novel thiol-modified magnetic
activated carbon adsorbent of NiFe2O4-PAC-SH
was successfully synthesized with a facile and safe hydrothermal method
without any toxic and harmful reaction media. The as-prepared NiFe2O4-PAC-SH can effectively remove mercury(II) ions
from aqueous solution. The maximal adsorption capacities from the
experiment and Langmuir fitting achieve 298.8 and 366.3 mg/g at pH
7, respectively, exceeding most of adsorptive materials. The as-prepared
NiFe2O4-PAC-SH has an outstanding regeneration
performance, remarkable hydrothermal stability, and efficient separation
efficiency. The data of kinetics, isotherms, and thermodynamics show
that the adsorption of mercury(II) ions is spontaneous and exothermic.
Ion exchange and electrostatic attraction are the main adsorption
factors. The experimental results exhibit that the NiFe2O4-PAC-SH can be a prominent substitute for conventional
activated carbon as an adsorbent.

==== Body
1 Introduction
With the development of industry, various pollutants containing heavy
metals, dyes, antibiotics, toxic compounds, etc., are discharged into
the water body, resulting in more and more serious water pollution.1 Among these pollutants, the heavy metal mercury
has attracted much attention because of its serious damage to the
ecosystem and harm to the human body and its characteristics of migration
and enrichment. Mercury in wastewater is mainly resulted from chloralkali,
plastics, batteries, electronics, and other industries,2,3 which exist in the form of inorganic divalent mercury ions.4,5

To quickly and safely deal with mercury pollution, it is urgent
to seek relevant methods or materials to solve these problems. Compared
to conventional technologies, including membrane filtration,6 ion exchange,7 biological
adsorption,8 chemical precipitation,9 and so on, adsorption method is a low-cost and
high-efficiency technology, which can be used to really solve these
problems resulted from mercury pollution.10 For example, activated carbon adsorption columns are often employed
at the end of the treatment system of electroplating wastewater containing
mercury to remove residual heavy metals and ensure the effluent up
to the corresponding standards.

Among many adsorbents, activated
carbon (AC) is a kind of black porous solid adsorption material with
unique properties. During the process of activation of activated carbon,
a large amount of interspaces are produced, forming a large surface
area and many functional groups, including carboxyl, hydroxyl, and
other functional groups.11 The value of
the specific surface area (BET) of activated carbon can reach 500–1700
m2/g.

However, although activated carbon is a good
adsorbent for removing heavy metals, its adsorption ability is still
greatly limited by its nonpolar characteristics, which hinder the
interaction between charged metal ions and activated carbon surfaces.
Moreover, the other performance of activated carbon, including slow
adsorption rate and low adsorption capacity, also severely impairs
the application of activated carbon in the wastewater treatment.

Therefore, the chemical modification for activated carbon has received
much attention and development. Based on the theory of hard and soft
acid–base (HSAB), mercury(II) is a soft acid and easy to form
a stable complex with soft alkali, and the reaction process between
mercury(II) and soft alkali has a high complexation rate.12−14

Thiol, as a functionalized
modified material, has been widely used in the field of materials
science. At present, there are more and more researches on the treatment
of pollutants with thiol-functionalized adsorbents. Based on the HSAB
theory, thiol is a soft alkali and can easily combine with mercury(II)
ions to achieve the removal of mercury from the water body.14 There are many thiol-functionalized methods,
including silane reaction,15 sulfur modification,16 etc. However, the above methods have some obvious
defects, such as complicated operation, very long reaction time, high
temperature or high pressure, toxic and harmful reaction media, and
so on. Therefore, in order to improve these defects, the grafting
of thiol functional groups on the surface of activated carbon was
achieved by a simple esterification reaction for only 6 h at 353 K
with thioglycolic acid as the modified precursor, concentrated sulfuric
acid as the catalyst, and acetic anhydride as the dehydrating agent
in the present study. The employed thiol-modified method is simpler,
more economical, and safer compared to conventional technologies.

In addition, there is another defect for the application of common
powder activated carbon (PAC). Because it is difficult for PAC to
be recovered from water after adsorption, which not only restricts
its application in water treatment but also increases the disposal
cost, the recovery of used PAC from water is of great significance
to reduce the disposal cost. In recent years, magnetic technology
has been widely developed and employed to solve the above defects
of solid–liquid separation in water treatment.17−19 However, some magnetic particles
like Fe3O4, CoFe2O4, etc.,
are easy to be corroded by acidic substances in the wastewater with
low pH value.

Hence, the acid-resistant magnetic NiFe2O4 was selected as a magnetic modifier in the present
study to enhance the separation efficiency of activated carbon from
water after adsorption. Magnetic activated carbon (NiFe2O4-PAC) can be obtained with a co-precipitation method
by loading NiFe2O4 on the surface of powdered
activated carbon. Finally, the synthesized NiFe2O4-PAC-SH was used to remove mercury(II) ions from wastewater. The
adsorption effects of NiFe2O4-PAC-SH on mercury(II)
ions, including solution pH, reaction temperature, dosage of adsorbents,
and concentration of mercury(II) ions, were all studied. Moreover,
the adsorption isotherm model, kinetic model, and thermodynamics were
established to explore the adsorption mechanism of mercury(II) ions
onto NiFe2O4-PAC-SH. The corresponding possible
adsorption mechanism was also proposed based on the experimental results
and adsorbent characterization.

2 Experimental Methods
2.1 Materials
PAC (charcoal, 200 mesh), NiCl2·6H2O, FeCl3·6H2O, NH3·H2O, sodium hydroxide (NaOH), concentrated
hydrochloric acid (HCl), and concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) are all purchased from McLean Co., Ltd. (Shanghai). Thioglycolic
acid, acetic anhydride, and concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) are obtained from Aladdin Co., Ltd. (Shanghai). All
the above reagents are analytical.

2.2 Preparation of NiFe2O4-PAC
and NiFe2O4-PAC-SH
A 100 mL HNO3 solution (2 M) containing 10.0 g of PAC was heated to 363
K with continuous stirring for 6 h. After that, the solution was washed
to neutral with pure water and then dried in an oven at 333 K. Two
grams of PAC was added into a 180 mL mixed solution containing 2.38
g of NiCl2·6H2O and 5.41 g of FeCl3·6H2O. The mixed solution containing PAC was
stirred with ultrasonic treatment for 30 min. Afterward, 11 mL of
NH3·H2O was added dropwise into the above
solution and continued to be stirred for 20 min. Subsequently, the
solution was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon autoclave and reacted
at 493 K for 12 h. After the reaction, the material of NiFe2O4-PAC was washed several times to neutral and then dried
at 333 K.

The as-prepared NiFe2O4-PAC
(1.0 g) was placed in a brown reagent bottle containing 3.5 mL of
thioglycolic acid, 2.5 mL of acetic anhydride, and 25 μL of
concentrated H2SO4. The solution was sealed
and reacted at 353 K for 8 h. After the reaction, the material was
washed with pure water several times and dried at 333 K with vacuum
condition. The material of NiFe2O4-PAC-SH was
obtained. The scheme of material synthesis and mercury(II) ions removal
is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Scheme of material synthesis
and mercury(II) ion removal.

2.3 Characterizations
The surface morphology of the as-prepared materials was observed
by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, ZEISS-SUPRA55,
Germany). The crystal structure was analyzed by X-ray diffraction
(XRD, D/MAX-2550-18KW, Japan). The functional groups on the surface
of the materials were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR,
Nicolet-6700, USA) with wavenumbers of 400–4000 cm–1. The magnetic strength of the materials was measured by a vibrating
sample magnetometer (VSM, Qunantumpesign, MPMS3, USA). The values
of the specific surface area (BET) and pore size of the materials
were measured by a N2 adsorption–desorption instrument
(Autosorb-JQZ-MP-XR-VP, USA). The molecular structure and element
types were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Escalab
250, USA). The zeta potentials of the materials were determined by
a zeta potentiometer (ZETAPLAS, USA) to analyze the interaction between
adsorbents and contaminants in the solution.

2.4 Batch Adsorption Experiments
The
adsorption capacities of the adsorbents were evaluated under the conditions
of various solution pH, dosage (g), reaction time (t, min), and reaction temperature (T, K). For the
effect of solution pH, a 100 mL solution containing mercury(II) ions
with initial concentration (C0, 30 mg/L)
was added into a 250 mL conical flask and then adjusted to the desired
pH values with 0.1 and 1 M HCl or NaOH solution. The equilibrium capacity
(qe, mg/g) was determined based on the
values of C0, equilibrium concentration
(Ce, mg/g), dosage, and solution volume
(V, L) through a cold atomic absorption adsorption
spectrophotometer (F732-VJ, Jiangfeng, China).20 The experimental conditions were fixed in the dosage of
0.005 g, T = 298 K, and t = 6 h
under various pH values of 2–8.

In order to compare the
effects of different dosages on the adsorption of mercury(II) ions,
the experiment was carried out under the conditions of T = 298 K, t = 6 h, pH 7, V = 100
mL, and C0 = 30.0 mg/L with various dosages
of 0.003–0.016 g. For the concentration effect of mercury,
the dosages of adsorbents were fixed in 0.005 g with various concentrations
of mercury(II) ions of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0, and 8.0 mg/L. The
instantaneous capacity (qt, mg/g) was
obtained based on the values of C0, instantaneous
concentration (Ct, mg/L), dosage, and
solution volume at a required time (t, min).21 The removal efficiency (E,
%) of mercury(II) ions was calculated based on the values of C0 and Ce.

In the fitting of Langmuir and Freundlich models, 0.005 g of adsorbent
was added into the mercury(II) solution with various initial concentrations
of C0 = 10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0, and 50.0
mg/L under the temperatures of 298, 308, and 318 K, respectively.
The solution pH was adjusted to 7. Adsorption kinetics was carried
out under the conditions of a dosage of 0.005 g, C0 = 30.0 mg/L, V = 100 mL, pH 7, T = 298 K, and shaking rate of 165 r/min. The residual concentration
of mercury(II) ions was determined at the times of 1, 3, 5, 10, 15,
30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360, and 480 min, respectively.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Characterizations
From Figure 2a,b,
the surface of activated carbon is relatively smooth, and there are
some obvious gaps on the surface of activated carbon. After modification,
a large number of NiFe2O4 particles can be found
on the surface of activated carbon, as shown in Figure 2c,d, which proves that NiFe2O4 has been successfully loaded on the surface of activated
carbon. The size of NiFe2O4 particles is about
20–30 nm.

Figure 2 SEM images
of the as-prepared materials: (a,
b) PAC, (c, d) NiFe2O4-PAC, (e, f) NiFe2O4-PAC-SH.

Figure 2e,f shows that the amount of NiFe2O4 particles on the surface of activated carbon does not change obviously
after grafting the thiol groups through esterification reaction. The
result indicates that the as-synthesized NiFe2O4 particles have not been greatly affected during the process of esterification.

Figure 3 shows the
XRD images of PAC, NiFe2O4-PAC, and NiFe2O4-PAC-SH. It can be seen that the as-prepared
PAC has two broad and irregular diffraction peaks at the ranges of
20–30° and 40–48°, which corresponds to the
(002) and (100) planes,22,23 respectively. The diffraction
peaks at 2θ of 30.3°, 35.7°, 43.4°, 57.4°,
and 63.0° in the XRD diagrams of NiFe2O4-PAC and NiFe2O4-PAC-SH coincide with the peaks
of the (220), (311), (400), (511), and (440) planes in the standard
spectrum of NiFe2O4 (JCPDS card no. 54-0964),
respectively. From the XRD diagrams of NiFe2O4-PAC and NiFe2O4-PAC-SH, the peak of PAC is
not clear. This may be due to the high peak strength of the NiFe2O4 crystal and amorphous structure of PAC, resulting
in that the peaks of PAC are not shown.19

Figure 3 XRD images
of PAC, NiFe2O4-PAC, and NiFe2O4-PAC-SH.

The XRD result indicates that NiFe2O4 has been successfully synthesized on the surface of activated carbon.
Moreover, the main peaks in NiFe2O4-PAC-SH are
consistent with those in NiFe2O4-PAC. The fact
reveals that the introduction of thiol groups has no effect on the
as-synthesized magnetic NiFe2O4 particles. The
result can be also proved via the SEM measurement shown in Figure 2.

FT-IR technology
can be employed to study the performance and change of functional
groups on the surface of materials. From Figure 4, two new vibrational peaks at 409 and 604
cm–1 can be observed in the spectra of NiFe2O4-PAC-SH and NiFe2O4-PAC
after the loading of NiFe2O4 on the surface
of activated carbon, corresponding to the Ni–O and Fe–O
vibrational peaks in NiFe2O4 crystals,24,25 respectively. However, the peak of Ni–O is displayed at 409
cm–1 and close to the detection edges of the FT-IR
instrument, so this peak of Ni–O is an incomplete absorption
peak.

Figure 4 FT-IR of PAC, NiFe2O4-PAC,
and NiFe2O4-PAC-SH.

In the FT-IR chromatography, the wide peak at 3421 cm–1 is the stretching vibration peak of −OH.26 The peaks at around 2830 cm–1 are the symmetric stretching peak and antisymmetric stretching peak
of −CH2.27 The absorption
peak at 1355 cm–1 is the stretching vibration of
−CH on the surface of activated carbon.28 The absorption peak at 1078 cm–1 is the
stretching vibration of C–O.29 The
absorption peak at 1604 cm–1 can be attributed to
the stretching vibration of C=O and C–O and the antisymmetric
stretching vibration of C=C.30 There
is a ring vibration peak at 1604 cm–1 in the chromatography
of the three materials, attributed to the stretching vibration of
C=O in aromatic esters. The result indicates that the alcohol
hydroxyl groups on the surface of activated carbon are successfully
esterified with thioglycolic acid. In the FT-IR diagram of NiFe2O4-PAC-SH, there is a weak absorption peak at 2363
cm–1, which is due to the introduction of −SH,
but the position of the peak shifts from 2560 cm–1 due to the influence of C≡C.14

Figure S1a,b (Supporting Information)
are the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm and pore
size distribution of PAC, NiFe2O4-PAC, and NiFe2O4-PAC-SH. From Figure S1a, the adsorption–desorption curve of NiFe2O4-PAC-SH belongs to a type IV isotherm, showing an obvious
hysteresis loop. The value of BET, total pore volume, and pore size
of the three materials are recorded in Table S1, and the corresponding values of NiFe2O4-PAC-SH
are 1700.4 m2/g, 1.59 cm3/g, and 7.45 nm, respectively.
Compared with the virgin PAC, the values of BET and pore size changed
slightly, but the value of pore volume was greatly increased after
modification.

The electrochemical properties of the adsorbent
surface play an important role in the adsorption of charged pollutants. Figure 5 shows the zeta potential
analysis of the as-prepared three materials. It can be seen that the
surface of PAC when pH < 4 presents a negative charge at pH 3–9
and the zeta potential decreases gradually and tends to be gentle
with the increase in pH. After grafting of thiol functional groups
on the surface of activated carbon, the surface of NiFe2O4-PAC-SH is completely negatively charged at pH 3–9.
The potentials of NiFe2O4-PAC-SH are higher
than those of PAC and NiFe2O4-PAC at each pH
value, which is due to the fact that thiol is a soft base. Moreover,
the potential of NiFe2O4-PAC-SH reaches the
lowest value of −24.8 mV at pH 8. The increase in surface negative
charges is conducive to the adsorption of positively charged mercury(II)
ions.

of PAC, NiFe2O4-PAC, and NiFe2O4-PAC-SH.

Figure 6 shows the magnetic strength of PAC, NiFe2O4-PAC, and NiFe2O4-PAC-SH. The saturation magnetization
values of NiFe2O4-PAC and NiFe2O4-PAC-SH are 25.8 and 20.9 emu/g, respectively. It can be seen
that the magnetism of NiFe2O4-PAC-SH is a little
smaller than that of NiFe2O4-PAC. However, the
value does not affect the magnetic separation efficiency of NiFe2O4-PAC-SH. The video in the Supporting Information
(Supporting Video 1) reveals a quick separation
of NiFe2O4-PAC-SH from aqueous solution after
adsorption under an external magnetic field.

Figure 6 VSM of PAC, NiFe2O4-PAC,
and NiFe2O4-PAC-SH.

Figure 7a is the XPS spectra before
adsorption. From the image, it can be known that the ingredients of
PAC are mainly C and O elements. After being modified with magnetic
particles, two new peaks of Fe 2p and Ni 2p are easy to be found,
which indicates a successful synthesis of NiFe2O4 on the surface of activated carbon. An S 2p peak in the NiFe2O4-PAC-SH can be found, corresponding to the existence
of −SH. In Figure 7b, there are three characteristic peaks at 284.7, 285.8, and
288.4 eV, corresponding to the presence of sp2 hybrid carbon in the
material, stretching vibrations of C–O, and ester bond O—C=O,
respectively.31

of (a) survey scan, (b) C 1s, (c)
O 1s, (d) Fe 2p, (e) N 1s, and (f) S 2p of NiFe2O4-PAC-SH.

The peaks of O 1s
at 530.5 and 531.7 eV shown in Figure 7c are attributed to the inorganic oxygen in NiFe2O432 and characteristic
peak of C=O.33 The binding energies
of 711.9, 723.3, 855.9, and 861.9 eV in Figure 7d,e are attributed to Fe 2p3/2, Fe 2p1/2, Ni 2p3/2, and Ni 2p1/2,32 respectively. The result demonstrates
again the presence of NiFe2O4 nanoparticles
in the material. In Figure 7f, the absorbance peaks at 163.9 and 165.1 eV are due to the
introduction of −SH after thioglycolic acid was grafted onto
the surface of the material,14 corresponding
to S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2, respectively.

3.2 Adsorption Performance
3.2.1 Effect of pH
In general, solution pH value has an important influence on the adsorption
performance of adsorbents.34 According
to the analysis of zeta potential, it can be seen that the pH solution
value can affect the surface charges and thus affect the surface activity
of the adsorbents. Meanwhile, solution pH also affects the existence
morphology of mercury ions. Therefore, it is important to study the
effect of various solution pH values on the adsorption of adsorbents
for mercury ions.

From Figure 8, it can be seen that the adsorption capacity of NiFe2O4-PAC-SH for mercury(II) ions increases with the
increase in pH at the ranges of 2–7. The adsorption capacity
reaches a maximum of 298.8 mg/g at pH 7. When the solution pH is greater
than 7, the adsorption capacity of NiFe2O4-PAC-SH
for mercury(II) ions decreased.

Figure 8 Effect of pH on the adsorption capacity of the
three adsorbents.

It can also be seen from Figure 8 that the adsorption
capacity of PAC for mercury(II) ions is similar to that of NiFe2O4-PAC, which indicates that the surface activity
of PAC has no obvious enhancement after being modified by NiFe2O4 alone. The result suggests that the key role
for adsorption is not the magnetic NiFe2O4 particles.
However, after grafting of thiol groups on the surface of activated
carbon, the surface activity of PAC obtains significant enhancement,
directly resulting in high adsorption capacity and removal efficiency
of mercury(II) ions. The result demonstrates that the introduction
of −SH has a great promotion on the adsorption capacity of
PAC, which is consistent with previous reports.14,21

3.2.2 Effect of Dosage
and Concentration
The effect of various dosages on the adsorption
capacity of NiFe2O4-PAC-SH was investigated,
and the results are shown in Figure 9a. It can be seen that the adsorption capacities of
NiFe2O4-PAC-SH for mercury(II) ions decrease
with the increase in dosage, but the removal efficiencies increase.
The reason is that the introduction of −SH groups enhances
the surface activity of PAC, leading to high removal efficiencies
to mercury(II) ions. However, both the reduction of the number of
active sites after continuous adsorption of mercury(II) ions and the
neutralization of negative charges on the surface of PAC cause the
descending of the adsorption capacity of NiFe2O4-PAC-SH. Moreover, the removal efficiencies are a little low under
the very low dosage of adsorbents. However, when the dosage of adsorbents
reaches 0.13 g/L, the removal efficiency is up to over 90%. In consideration
of economy, the optimum dosage of NiFe2O4-PAC-SH
is selected to be 0.05 g/L.

Figure 9 (a) Effect
of dosage and (b) initial concentration with NiFe2O4-PAC-SH.

For the removal of mercury(II) in
the low polluted water body, assuming that there is 0.005 g of mercury(II)
in a liter of water, the concentration of mercury(II) ions is 5 mg/L
and belongs to a low-level content. As the maximal adsorption capacity
of NiFe2O4-PAC-SH is 298.8 mg/g at pH 7, hence,
the residual concentration of mercury(II) ions in treated water should
be far below 1 μg/L when the dosage of adsorbents is 0.05 g/L.
In order to prove the above speculation, the test of various initial
concentrations of mercury(II) was carried out under the conditions
of a dosage of 0.05 g/L and solution pH of 7, and the results are
shown in Figure 9b.
Based on the data in Figure 9b, it can be seen that the residual concentrations Ce of mercury(II) ions are all below 0.001 mg/L,
and the removal efficiencies are also over 99.98% when the solution
initial concentration C0 is less than
or equal to 5 mg/L. The result completely meets the standards of mercury(II)
ions (1 μg/L) in natural water defined by the World Health Organization
(WHO).35 However, the residual concentrations Ce of mercury(II) ions are over 0.001 mg/L when
the initial concentration C0 is greater
than 5 mg/L. In fact, the concentration of mercury(II) ions in most
of industrial wastewater and common rivers is far below 0.005 g/L.
A high concentration of mercury(II) ions in industrial wastewater
and rivers usually needs to be treated through a chemical method not
an adsorption method. Only when the concentration of mercury(II) ions
is below a certain value, the adsorption method is suitable. The above
results also show that NiFe2O4-PAC-SH can be
used to remove low-concentration mercury in natural water and is a
prominent substitute for conventional activated carbon as an adsorbent.

3.3 Adsorption Kinetics
In order to better explore adsorption kinetics of mercury(II) ions,
three kinetic models, including pseudo-first-order (eq 1), pseudo-second-order (eq 2), and intraparticle diffusion
(eq 3) models, were established
to fit the experimental data. The three model fitting formulas are
as follows 1   2   3  where k1 (min–1), k2 (g/mg/min),
and kd (mg/g/min0.5) are all
constants, and C is the thickness of the boundary
layer (mg/g).

Figure 10a shows the effect of NiFe2O4-PAC-SH
on the adsorption to mercury(II) at different times. It can be seen
from the diagram that the adsorption of mercury(II) by adsorbents
is greatly affected by time. Before 60 min, the adsorption rate of
mercury(II) by NiFe2O4-PAC-SH is very fast.
The adsorption capacity has reached 179.4 mg /g at 60 min. The reason
is due to the relatively large number of active sites on the surface
of NiFe2O4-PAC-SH at the beginning of the adsorption
reaction. As time goes on, more and more mercury(II) ions are adsorbed
onto the adsorbent surface, resulting in a decrease in the concentration
gradient between the adsorbent surface and the solution, thus reducing
the adsorption rate. When the time reaches 240 min, the adsorption
capacity of NiFe2O4-PAC-SH to mercury(II) ions
gradually reaches saturation and achieves 298.8 mg/g.

Figure 10 Effect of time on the (a) adsorption,
(b) pseudo-first-order,
(c) pseudo-second-order, and (d) intraparticle diffusion models.

To further
analyze the fitting results and evaluate the validity of various models,
four kinds of error functions, including the coefficient of determination
(R2), chi-square test (χ2), sum of square error (SSE), and root mean square error (RMSE),
are used. Generally, the higher R2 value
or the smaller χ2, SSE, and RMSE values, the better
fitting results between the experimental data and the model.14

Figure 10b,c are the fitting results of the pseudo-first-order
and pseudo-second models, respectively. The corresponding values of R2, χ2, SSE, and RMSE are calculated
with the three fitting models, and the results are listed in Table 1. It can be seen that
the pseudo-second-order model has higher R2 and smaller χ2, SSE, and RMSE values. Moreover,
the theoretical adsorption capacity (qe,cal) in the pseudo-second-order model is 303.4 mg/g, which is close
to the experimental capacity (qe,exp,
298.8 mg/g). The result indicates that the pseudo-second-order model
has a better consistency with the experimental data compared with
the pseudo-first-order model. The adsorption process involves some
chemical reaction.36,37 The experimental capacity exceeds
many other adsorptive materials as shown in Table 2.

Figure 10d is the fitting result of the intraparticle
diffusion model. The fitting plots reveal that there are two stages:
large pore diffusion stage and equilibrium adsorption stage. At the
first stage, the adsorption process of mercury(II) is transient and
fast. A large number of mercury(II) is adsorbed on the outer surface
of NiFe2O4-PAC-SH. At the second stage, the
concentration gradient of mercury(II) between the surface of adsorbents
and the inner solution decreases. As a result, the adsorption rate
becomes small and eventually tends to equilibrium.

3.4 Adsorption Isotherms
The adsorption isotherm can not only evaluate the adsorption ability
of adsorbents but also describe the interaction between mercury(II)
ions and adsorbent surface.43 The as-employed
isotherm models are Langmuir (eq 4), Freundlich (eq 5), Temkin (eq 6), and
Dubinin–Radushkevich (D–R; eq 7) models, which can be described as follows 4   5   6   7   8  The separation factor (RL) in the Langmuir model can be written as eq 9 9  where qm (mg/g) is the maximum monolayer
adsorption capacity, and KL (L/mg), KF (mg1–nLn/g), and KT are
the Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin model constants, respectively.
1/n (no unit) is an empirical constant. B = RT/bT (J/mg); ε
is the Polanyi potential (J/mol). β is a constant related to
the average adsorption energy (E, kJ/mol) and can
be calculated using the equation E = (2β)−0.5.

Figure 11 is the fitting results of Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin,
and Dubinin–Radushkevich isotherm models. The parameters obtained
by fitting the four models are listed in Table 3. It can be seen that the three coefficients
of determination R2 of the Langmuir model
are higher than those of other three models at three temperatures
and the values of χ2, SSE, and RMSE in the Langmuir
model is also smaller.

The results show that the Langmuir model
is more suitable to describe the adsorption process of NiFe2O4-PAC-SH for mercury(II) ions. Meanwhile, the process
is a monolayer adsorption, and there is no interaction between the
adsorbent molecules. At the three temperatures of 298, 308, and 318
K, the maximum adsorption capacity fitted by the Langmuir model is
363.3, 330.0, and 280.9 mg/g, respectively. That is to say, the adsorption
capacities of mercury(II) ions onto NiFe2O4-PAC-SH
decrease with the increase in temperature. The three RL values of 0.027, 0.026, and 0.023 fitted by the Langmuir
model are between 0 and 1, indicating a spontaneous and exothermic
adsorption process.44

The values
of 1/n in the Freundlich isotherm are less than 0.5,
which indicates that the adsorption process is easy to occur and the
adsorption capacities and strength are consistent with the above conclusion.45 The relatively big values of KT in the Temkin isotherm represent a relatively high adsorption
potential between the adsorbent NiFe2O4-PAC-SH
and mercury(II) ions. The values of bT increase with the increase in temperature, indicating that a low
temperature is favorable for the adsorption of mercury(II) onto NiFe2O4-PAC-SH.

For the Dubinin–Radushkevich
isotherm, the fitting results also reveal high R2 values. The three calculated values of average adsorption
energy E are 8.99, 8.28, and 8.01 kJ/mol, which is
between 8 and 16 kJ/mol, indicating that chemical adsorption is involved.14 The result may be due to the formation of complexation
between negatively charged functional groups on the surface of NiFe2O4-PAC-SH and positively charged mercury(II) ions
through covalent bond.46

3.5 Adsorption Thermodynamics
In general, the adsorption process involves thermodynamic parameters,
including energy, enthalpy, and entropy. The changes of these parameters
should be taken into account for analyzing the adsorption process.
Three thermodynamic parameters of Gibbs free energy ΔG0 (kJ/mol), enthalpy change ΔH0 (kJ/mol), and entropy change ΔS0 (J/mol/K) are employed as follows 10   11  where R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol/K), and KR is thermodynamic equilibrium constant.

Figure S2 shows the linear relationship between
ln Kd and 1/T at different
concentrations (20, 30, and 40 mg/L). The corresponding values of
Gibbs free energy (ΔG0), entropy
(ΔS0), and enthalpy (ΔH0) are calculated according to the fitting data,
and the results are listed in Table 4. It can be seen that the three values of ΔH0 are all negative, indicating an exothermic
adsorption process, which is consistent with the results fitted by
isotherm adsorption.

Table 4 Thermodynamic
Parameters for the Adsorption of Mercury(II) onto NiFe2O4-PAC-SH
 	 	 	ΔG0 (kJ/mol)	
C0 (mg/L)	ΔH0 (kJ/mol)	ΔS0 (J/mol/K)	298 K	308 K	318 K	
20	–14.37	12.11	–17.95	–18.15	–18.19	
30	–13.82	12.65	–17.56	–17.79	–17.80	
40	–13.21	14.06	–17.36	–17.63	–17.63	
The positive ΔS0 values of 12.11, 12.65, and 14.06 J/mol/K indicate the increase
in disorder at the solid–liquid interface and that a low temperature
is favorable for the adsorption of mercury(II) onto NiFe2O4-PAC-SH. All of the ΔG0 values are negative and less than 40 kJ/mol, which represents that
the adsorption process of mercury(II) onto NiFe2O4-PAC-SH is spontaneous and involves some chemical reaction.14

3.6 Regeneration Capability
That adsorbents can be used multiple
times is an important factor to determine whether the adsorbent can
be widely used. Hence, 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution was employed
as a regenerator to regenerate the NiFe2O4-PAC-SH
after reaching the adsorption equilibrium.

From the data shown
in Figure 12, the
adsorption capacity of NiFe2O4-PAC-S is about
246.2 mg/g after five cycles and only reduces 17.6%. The result shows
that the as-prepared adsorbent NiFe2O4-PAC-S
has an outstanding regeneration performance and can be a promising
adsorbent.

Figure 12 Regeneration
of NiFe2O4-PAC-SH after adsorption.

3.7 Mechanism
Speculation
Figure 13 is the comparative FT-IR chromatogram of NiFe2O4-PAC-SH before and after adsorption of mercury(II) ions.
It can be seen that the absorption peak of 1355 cm–1 increases obviously after the adsorption of mercury(II) ions, which
is due to the electrostatic action of −COOH in the adsorption
of mercury(II) ions.47 The result is consistent
with the data of zeta potentials. It is also found that after the
adsorption of mercury(II) ions, the −SH peak at 2363 cm–1 becomes weak, which is caused by the ion exchange
between −SH groups and mercury(II) ions.14 These results suggest that −SH groups play an important
role during the process of adsorption of mercury(II) ions onto NiFe2O4-PAC-SH.

Figure 13 FT-IR spectra of NiFe2O4-PAC-SH before and
after adsorption.

In addition, the FT-IR chromatogram
shown in Figure 13 also shows that the change of peak shape of NiFe2O4-PAC-SH is small before and after adsorption, which indicates
that chemisorption is not the only effect factor and the electrostatic
force can be another main factor based on the data of zeta potentials.
Besides, Figure 13 also presents that the performance of as-prepared NiFe2O4-PAC-SH has a great hydrothermal stability.

In
order to further analyze the reaction mechanism between the NiFe2O4-PAC-SH and mercury(II) ions, the NiFe2O4-PAC-SH containing adsorbed mercury(II) was characterized
by XPS technology. Figure 14a is the XPS energy spectra of NiFe2O4-PAC-SH before and after the adsorption of mercury(II) ions.

Figure 14 XPS spectra
of (a) wide scan, (b) Hg 4f, and (c) S 2p after adsorption.

The appearance of a new Hg 4f peak and the weakened S 2p peak can
be easily found on the diagram. From Figure 14b, the binding energies of Hg 4f5/2 and Hg 4f7/2 are 105.5 and 101.4 eV, respectively, which
can be attributed to the HgCl2 adsorbed on the surface
of NiFe2O4-PAC-SH. The above results prove that
mercury(II) ions are successfully adsorbed on the surface of the material.
In Figure 14c, it
is found that the peaks of S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2 shifted from high binding energies of 163.9 and 165.1 eV to low
binding energies of 163.4 and 164.8 eV, respectively. The reason is
due to S atoms in the −SH group that provide some electrons
to the mercury atoms during the process of adsorption, forming the
complexation of −S–Hg+ through covalent bond.14

As we know, mercury(II) ions mainly exist
in three morphologies in aqueous solution, namely, Hg2+, HgOH+, and Hg(OH)2.14 When the pH of aqueous solution is less than 3, there is mainly
Hg2+ in the solution. Hg2+ can reduce with the
increase in pH and finally disappear. On the contrary, the amounts
of HgOH+ and Hg(OH)2 increase with the increase
in pH. The number of HgOH+ reaches the maximum at pH 4.
When the pH is greater than 6, Hg2+ almost disappears,
and only a few of HgOH+ exist in the solution. Under the
condition of high pH (over 8), Hg(OH)2 is the main form
of existence. Figure 15 shows the schematic diagram of the possible adsorption mechanism
of mercury(II) ions (Hg2+) onto NiFe2O4-PAC-SH.

Figure 15 Possible
adsorption mechanism of mercury(II) onto NiFe2O4-PAC-SH.

Hg2+, HgOH+, and Hg(OH)2 combine with negatively charged NiFe2O4-PAC-SH to form NiFe2O4-PAC-S-Hg+ or NiFe2O4-PAC-S-HgOH through the way of ion
exchange or electrostatic attraction. As more and more compounds with
−S–Hg+ or −S–HgOH are formed,
the further combination of Hg2+ with −SH will be
prevented slightly due to the reduction of the number of active sites
and electrical neutralization.

Moreover, according to the HSAB
theory, the −SH group is a soft alkali, and mercury(II) is
a soft acid. Therefore, the affinity between the −SH group
and mercury(II) is very strong, and they can easily combine to form
a stable complex, leading to a high removal of mercury.

4 Conclusions
To improve
the adsorption performance and reduce the disposal cost, a novel thiol-modified
magnetic activated carbon adsorbent of NiFe2O4-PAC-SH was successfully synthesized with a facile and safe hydrothermal
method. The grafting of thiol groups was achieved by a simple esterification
reaction with thioglycolic acid as the modified precursor, concentrated
sulfuric acid as the catalyst, and acetic anhydride as the dehydrating
agent. The magnetism was realized with a co-precipitation method by
loading acid-resistant magnetic NiFe2O4 on the
surface of PAC. The as-prepared NiFe2O4-PAC-SH
can effectively and easily adsorb mercury(II) ions from aqueous solution.
The maximal adsorption capacities from the experiment and Langmuir
model achieve 298.8 and 366.3 mg/g at pH 7, respectively, exceeding
other adsorptive materials. It is easy to separate the adsorbent of
NiFe2O4-PAC-SH after adsorption from water through
an external magnetic field. The data of kinetics, isotherms, and thermodynamics
indicate that the adsorption of mercury(II) ions is spontaneous and
exothermic and involves a chemical process. Ion exchange and electrostatic
attraction are the main adsorption mechanism. Moreover, the as-prepared
NiFe2O4-PAC-SH has an outstanding regeneration
performance and remarkable stability, which is pretty favorable for
the application of NiFe2O4-PAC-SH in the wastewater
treatment. The whole experiment and analysis clearly exhibit that
the NiFe2O4-PAC-SH can be an outstanding substitute
for conventional activated carbon as an adsorbent.
