In the present work, the solvent-free
hydrodeoxygenation of palm oil as a representative triglyceride model
compound to diesel-like hydrocarbons was evaluated in a batch reactor
using Pt-decorated MoO2 catalysts. The catalysts with various
Pt loadings (0.5–3%) were synthesized by an incipient wetness
impregnation method. The metallic Pt and MoO2 phases were
detected in the XRD patterns of as-prepared catalysts after the reaction
and acted as active components for the deoxygenation reactions. The
XPS experiments confirmed the existence of metallic Pt and PtOx species. The XANES investigation of Mo L3-edge spectra elucidated a change in the valence state by
the transformation of MoO3 into MoO2 species
after the deoxygenation reaction. The TEM observation revealed the
formation of Pt nanoparticles in the range of 1–3 nm decorated
on MoO2 species. The number of acid sites increased with
stronger metal–support interactions on increasing the Pt loading.
The catalytic performance of the MoO2 catalyst significantly
improved with a small amount of Pt decoration. However, the further
increase in Pt loading did not relatively increase the deoxygenation
activity due to the formation of the agglomerated Pt particles. The
high performance of the decorated catalysts could be attributed to
the moderate acidity from the Pt dispersed on MoO2 toward
decarbonylation and decarboxylation reactions.

1 Introduction
Currently,
the utilization of bioresources from agricultural feedstocks for alternative
biofuel production has been recognized as an effective process due
to the depletion of fossil fuel and global environmental problems.
Compared with the various types of bioresources such as lignocellulosic
biomass and carbohydrates, vegetable oils, fatty acids, and animal
fats have been generally used as starting materials for biofuel production
due to their low functionalization degree and simple chemical structure
compared with lignocellulosic materials.1,2 Diesel-like
hydrocarbons produced via hydrodeoxygenation of triglycerides
and fatty acids from agricultural oil feedstock have been recommended
as a sustainable replacement for diesel-based petroleum because their
fuel properties are comparable to those of the fossil diesel.3−6 Generally, the deoxygenation of oil feedstock containing triglycerides
and/or fatty acids in the presence of hydrogen and suitable catalysts
could produce diesel-like n-alkanes under moderate
conditions (temperature 300–400 °C and H2 pressure
20–50 bar).1,7−12 Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), decarboxylation (DeCO2), and
decarbonylation (DeCO) are the three major reaction pathways occurring
in the deoxygenation process.13,14 HDO leads to the elimination
of oxygen by generating water and produces n-alkanes
with a carbon number similar to that of the fatty acid component in
the oil feed. DeCO and DeCO2 pathways result in the oxygen removal by
producing the carbon monoxide and water or carbon dioxide, respectively,
with the n-alkanes shorter by one carbon atom compared
with the original fatty acid.

Various transition metal and metal
sulfide catalysts have been utilized for the hydrodeoxygenation of
triglycerides, fatty acids, and other oxygenated biomass compounds,
especially in liquid-phase reactions under a hydrogen atmosphere such
as NiMoS2,15−17 CoMoS2,16,18 Ni,1,7,19−23 Co,1,7,24 Pd,19,25−27 and Pt1,27−29 supported on
various materials such as Al2O3, TiO2, SiO2, zeolites, and carbon. In the case of transition
metal sulfide catalysts, the sulfiding of the oil feedstock is required
to retard the catalyst deactivation.24,30 In particular,
sulfur leaching due to the small amount of water generated from HDO
and DeCO reactions leads to a shortened catalyst lifetime and sulfur
contamination in the liquid product.31 Among
the other catalysts, sulfur-free monometallic catalysts such as Ni-
and Co-based catalysts exhibited high activity toward DeCO2 and DeCO reactions compared with the NiMo and CoMo sulfides supported
on Al2O3 catalysts. However, the formation of
a large amount of coke during deoxygenation was the major reason for
catalyst deactivation.7 In addition, precious-metal-based
catalysts such as Pt and Pd have been extensively investigated for
hydrodeoxygenation with and without a solvent due to their high activity
under mind conditions.27,32−35 In fact, the Pt- and Pd-based
catalysts are favorable for DeCO and DeCO2 routes with
a lower hydrogen consumption than for the HDO route.1 Thus, the utilization of these kinds of catalysts under
solvent-free conditions and limited hydrogen supply in a batch reactor
is crucial for further investigation. Recently, transition metal oxides
such as MoO3–x have been reported
as active components for oxygen removal from small oxygenated compounds,
mainly palmitic acid and oleic acid via HDO under
a moderate hydrogen pressure.35−39 The oxygen vacancies on the MoO3–x surface occurred by the reaction between hydrogen and the generated
water via HDO, and DeCO has been reported as the
active site for breaking the C–O bond.36 In particular, molybdenum dioxide, MoO2, has been confirmed
to be an active component for the C–O and C=O breakings
for palmitic acid hydrodeoxygenation.37,38 Nevertheless,
the deoxygenation of triglycerides using molybdenum oxides under solvent-free
conditions was limited because of the complexity of the reaction pathway via the hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reactions to produce
fatty acids and, subsequently, n-alkane production
through HDO, DeCO, and DeCO2 reactions. To the best of
our knowledge, the investigation of the effect of Pt-decorated molybdenum
oxide in the form of MoO2 on the solvent-free hydrodeoxygenation
of triglycerides has never been reported in the literature.

Therefore, we investigated the solvent-free hydrodeoxygenation of
triglycerides to diesel-like hydrocarbons over the Pt-decorated MoO2 catalysts in a batch reactor. Extensive characterizations
of catalysts using N2 sorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD),
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption near-edge
structure (XANES), NH3 temperature-programmed desorption
(NH3-TPD), H2 temperature-programmed reduction
(H2-TPR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) were carried out to comprehend the correlation
between the structural and textural properties and deoxygenation activities
of the synthesized catalysts. Their catalytic performances were systematically
compared in terms of the triglyceride conversion, gasoline and diesel
yields, the relative involvement of HDO (hydrodeoxygenation) and DeCO/DeCO2 (decarbonylation and decarboxylation) activities, and n-alkane product distribution.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Textural Properties by
BET
The N2 sorption experiments were first conducted
to investigate the textural properties of the calcined samples. The
N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms of all of the samples
are exhibited in Figure 1a. According to the IUPAC classification, it can be found that both
the bare MoO3 and Pt-decorated MoO3 samples
exhibited a type II isotherm with H3-type hysteresis loops. The pore
size distribution calculated from the adsorption branches of the isotherms
using the BJH model reveals the presence of uniform mesopores and
an average pore diameter for all of the samples except for the 3%Pt-decorated
MoO3 catalyst (Figure 1b).

Figure 1 (a) N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms
and (b) pore size distribution of the MoO3, 0.5%Pt/MoO3, 1%Pt/MoO3, 2%Pt/MoO3, and 3%Pt/MoO3 catalysts.

Table 1 summarizes the specific surface area, average
pore diameter, and pore volume of the calcined samples. The BET surface
area and pore volume of the bare MoO3 were 3.63 m2 g–1 and 0.0039 cm3 g–1, respectively. A small increase in the surface area from 3.91 to
4.57 m2 g–1 with a larger pore volume
in the range of 0.0043–0.0065 cm3 g–1 was observed on increasing the Pt loading from 0.5 to 2%. The pore
diameter was in the range of 43–57 nm for the Pt loading in
the range of 0.5–2%. Interestingly, an increase in the Pt loading
of up to 3% led to a significant increase in the BET surface area
of up to 22.46 m2 g–1 accompanied by
the highest pore volume of 0.1217 cm3 g–1. This may be due to the formation of small pores with an average
pore diameter of 21.7 nm, resulting in the enlargement of the catalyst
surface area.

2.2 Phase Identification by
XRD
The XRD patterns of all of the fresh catalysts are exhibited
in Figure 2. The XRD
analyses confirmed the formation of the α-MoO3 phase
(JCPDS No. 05-0508) after the calcination of ammonium heptamolybdate
in the air at 500 °C for 5 h. The decoration of Pt species into
as-synthesized MoO3 samples resulted in the existence of
the diffraction peak of metallic Pt at 2θ = 39.8° to the
(111) plane of the face-centered cubic structure (PDF#04-0802).40 The disappearance of the diffraction peak at
2θ = 46.2° corresponding to the (200) plane of Pt was due
to the overlap with the diffraction peak of MoO3. As demonstrated
in Figure 2, the diffraction
peak intensity of Pt seemed to be increased with Pt loadings, implying
the larger catalyst particle formation.

Figure 2 XRD patterns of the fresh
(a) MoO3, (b) 0.5%Pt/MoO3, (c) 1%Pt/MoO3, (d) 2%Pt/MoO3, and (e) 3%Pt/MoO3 catalysts.

The catalysts after the reaction tests were subsequently
characterized by XRD to identify the active components for the hydrodeoxygenation
reaction (Figure 3).
Interestingly, the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 26.3, 37.2, 54.4,
60.2, and 67.5° assigned to the planes (011), (020), (022), (031),
and (−231) of the MoO2 phase, respectively (JCPDS:
65-1273),37 were observed for all of the
spent catalysts. It should be deduced that MoO3 was completely in situ reduced to MoO2 during the reaction.
This was similar to the previous study where the MoO3 was
transformed into the MoO2 phase at 400 °C under the
high pressure of H2.41 Furthermore,
the diffraction peak of metallic Pt at 2θ = 39.8° (111)
still presented after the reaction and metallic Pt acted as an active
site in hydrodeoxygenation reactions. In the case of the 0.5%Pt/MoO3 sample, the diffraction peak of metallic Pt could not be
detected due to the low amount of Pt loading. Similar to the fresh
catalysts, the diffraction peak of Pt(111) observed in decorated samples
became shaper, indicating the growth of metal particles with increasing
Pt loading.

(e) 3%Pt/MoO3 catalysts.

2.3 Pt Surface Investigation by XPS
The XPS
analysis was conducted to confirm the form of Pt species before and
after the reaction. The XPS survey spectra of the fresh and spent
1%Pt/MoO3 samples show characteristic peaks of O, C, Pt,
and Mo elements (see Figure S1a,b). The
presence of carbon could be ascribed to the sample preparation from
the carbon tape or coke deposition of the spent sample. As displayed
in Figure 4, the XPS
profiles of Pt 4f spectra of the fresh and spent samples exhibited
the characteristic peaks of Pt 4f as two distinguished peaks of Pt
4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2 doublets for both samples,
indicating that the Pt species predominately existed on the MoO2 species. The peaks were deconvoluted into two oxidation states
of metallic Pt0 and oxidized Pt2+. In the case
of fresh 1%Pt/MoO3, two peaks occurred at 71.3 and 73.4
eV for Pt0 and those of Pt2+ appeared at 72.7
and 76.2 eV. The 4f peaks of Pt0 for the spent 1%Pt/MoO3 appeared at 70.2 and 73.5 eV and those of Pt2+ occurred at 71.4 and 74.7 eV. The shift observed in 4f peak positions
of Pt in the presence of the spent 1%Pt/MoO3 to lower binding
energies was due to a change in the electronic structure of metal
oxide to metallic species during the deoxygenation. A shift in electron
transitions to lower binding energies was reported for the supported
Pt–WOx42 and Pt–MoOx35 catalysts. As summarized in Table 2, the presence of a high amount
of the Pt0 state was observed for the spent 1%Pt/MoO3, confirming that the surface PtOx species were in situ reduced to metallic Pt in
the presence of H2 at 400 °C.

4f spectra of (a) fresh 1%Pt/MoO3 and (b) spent 1%Pt/MoO3.

2.4 Mo Oxidation State by XANES
To further
investigate the oxidation state of Mo in MoO3 and 1%Pt/MoO3 samples before and after the deoxygenation experiments, the
X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) analysis was conducted. Figure 5 exhibits the normalized
and first-derivative Mo L3-edge XANES spectra of all of
the Mo standards and the MoO3 and 1%Pt/MoO3 catalysts
before and after the deoxygenation reaction. The edge position, white
line, and spectral features were used to identify the form of samples
compared with the Mo foil, bulk MoO2, and bulk MoO3 standards. As demonstrated in Figure 5, the edge and shape of the spectra of the
as-prepared MoO3 and 1%Pt/MoO3 samples by the
decomposition of ammonium heptamolybdate at 500 °C have almost
the same characteristic features as the bulk MoO3 standard,
indicating the complete transformation of ammonium heptamolybdate
into the bulk MoO3 sample. This observation is in agreement
with the XRD analysis of all of the fresh samples. In contrast, it
was found that the adsorption edges of the MoO3 and 1%Pt/MoO3 catalysts after the deoxygenation reaction shifted to lower
energy. As demonstrated in the first-derivative spectra in Figure 5, the transformation
of MoO3 to MoO2 forms was clearly detected by
the spectral features and edge position. These results implied that
a change in the valence state occurred during the deoxygenation process
and the MoO2 form acted as an active component for the
reaction.

2.5 Support and Metal Interaction
by H2-TPR
The H2 temperature-programmed
reduction (H2-TPR) experiments were conducted to investigate
interactions of the Pt and Mo species using calcined samples (Figure 6). The H2-TPR profile of MoO3 exhibited two major reduction peaks
in the wide temperature range of ca. 630–900 °C, indicating
the reduction behavior of pure MoO3 to metallic Mo. The
sharp peak at ca. 780 °C is due to the reduction of MoO3 to MoO2 and the broad peak at a higher temperature of
ca. 855 °C is assigned to the reduction of MoO2 to
metallic Mo, which was consistent with the previous study.43 The H2-TPR profiles of all of the
Pt-decorated MoO3 catalysts showed a reduction peak at
around 260 °C, confirming the characteristic reduction of surface
PtOx, which was detected by the XPS analysis.
A H2 consumption at ca. 500 °C for all of the decorated
samples might correspond to the H2 spillover from the Pt
species to MoO3 resulting in the partial reduction to MoO3–x. This suggested that the Pt loading
had strong metal–support interactions.44,45 In addition, the reduction peak of MoO3 to metallic Mo
at high temperatures in the wide range of ca. 700–900 °C
was quite different from that of bare MoO3, suggesting
that the Pt species changed the reduction behavior of MoO3 species. Although the reduction peaks of MoO3 to MoO2 occurred at temperatures higher than 700 °C, the MoO2 phase detected after the reaction (see in Figure 3) was attributable to the severe
operating conditions (T, 400 °C; initial H2P, 40 bar; and time, 3 h). As summarized
in Table S1, it was found that the calculated
H2 consumption from the characteristic reduction of PtOx was in the range of 0.82–0.96 mmol gcat–1 and the highest value was obtained
for the 1%Pt/MoO3 sample. The lower H2 consumption for the 2 and 3%Pt/MoO3 samples was expected
to be due to the lower metal dispersion and agglomeration of the higher
PtOx contents. This observation was in
agreement with a former investigation.46

2.6 Acidity
by NH3-TPD
The acidity of the bare MoO3 and Pt-decorated MoO3 catalysts was examined using NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD). The
catalysts were first in situ reduced in the presence
of H2 at the same reaction temperature to change the surface
PtOx to metallic Pt before NH3-TPD implementation. As exhibited in Figure 7, it was found that the NH3 desorbed
in the wide temperature range of 70–250 °C for the bare
MoO3 and 0.5–2%Pt-decorated MoO3 catalysts
and at 100–275 °C for the 3%Pt-decorated MoO3 catalyst. These characteristic desorption peaks were ascribable
to NH3 desorption on acidic sites of the pre-reduced catalysts.
The peak intensity of ammonia desorption for 0.5–3%Pt-decorated
MoO3 catalysts was much higher than that for bare MoO3. This NH3 desorption behavior implied that the
number of acidic sites on the catalyst surface relatively increased
by the decoration of Pt species into the MoO3 species.
In addition, the desorption peak of ammonia for the 3%Pt-decorated
MoO3 catalyst shifted to higher temperatures, indicating
that the ammonia strongly adsorbed on the catalyst surface, implying
stronger acidic sites generated for the higher Pt loading. Based on
the literature, it was reported that the high hydrodeoxygenation activity
was due to the synergetic effect between acidic and metallic sites.32 It was evident that the calculated number of
acidic sites significantly increased with Pt loading and the calculated
values using the ammonia standard are summarized in Table 1.

2.7 Morphology by SEM
SEM observations were performed to further study on the morphology
of the as-prepared catalysts. The SEM images of the fresh and spent
MoO3 and 1 and 3%Pt/MoO3 catalysts are represented
in Figure 8. It can
be seen that MoO3 consists of the angular-shaped particles
with different particle sizes, similar to the previous study.47 The microstructures of the fresh catalysts did
not change by the addition of Pt species into the MoO3 species.
On the other hand, the irregularities of angular-shaped particles
were detected, in particular, the observation of micropores for the
Pt-decorated MoO2 catalysts (see Figure S2b,c) after the hydrodeoxygenation experiments. It has been
reported that H2-reduced MoO3 catalysts were
accompanied by an increased specific surface area, which was the highest
when MoO3 was reduced to MoO2 by reduction degrees
of 60–70% at 400 °C.48−50 This may be due to the
formation of a porous structure inside the large angular-shaped particles
observed in this present study. Moreover, as shown in Figure S3a,b, the results of EDS measurements
of the prepared Pt-decorated catalysts before and after the reaction
revealed the existence of Pt species on the MoO3 species.

2.8 Particle Size Distribution
by TEM
The spent 1%Pt/MoO3 catalyst was selected
to examine the particle size distribution of Pt by TEM measurements
due to the highest activity among the other catalysts (Figure 9). TEM images exhibited
the spherical shape and uniform dispersion of metallic Pt decorated
on MoO2 species in the narrow range of 1–3 nm. Furthermore,
the observed lattice fringes of ca. 0.0224, 0.225, and 0.234 nm correspond
to the Pt(111) plane, indicating that the Pt species located on MoO2 species have a face-centered cubic (fcc) (111) lattice spacing.51 This was consistent with the XRD analysis. Moreover,
some agglomerated Pt particles with an average metal particle of 3.3
± 0.6 nm were detected in the fresh 3%Pt/MoO3 sample
(see Figure S4).

2.9 Catalytic
Performance of the Pt-Decorated MoO2 Catalysts
The solvent-free hydrodeoxygenation of refined palm oil as the representative
triglyceride model compound was conducted under the following conditions;
a temperature of 400 °C, an initial H2 pressure of
40 bar, and a reaction time of 3 h over the bare MoO3 and
Pt-decorated MoO3 catalysts. The bare MoO3 catalyst
was initially investigated by varying the reaction temperatures to
370, 400, and 430 °C to find a suitable reaction temperature
since the temperature significantly affected the conversion and product
yields. As demonstrated in Table S2, the
triglyceride conversion was 100% for all of the temperatures, indicating
that the triglyceride completely transformed into oxygenated intermediates
and desired products. The liquid product obtained from the deoxygenation
reaction at a reaction temperature of 370 °C became solidified
under ambient conditions and mainly consisted of fatty acids and a
small amount of fatty acid alcohols. This result was confirmed by
GC–MS analysis. This result suggested that the hydrogenation
of carbon double bonds in unsaturated triglycerides occurred, followed
by the carbon–oxygen bond cleavage toward the hydrogenolysis
of saturated triglycerides to generate the primary oxygenated intermediates
(fatty acids and fatty acid alcohols) and propane.1,52 Subsequently,
the produced fatty acids underwent hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), decarbonylation
(DeCO), and decarboxylation (DeCO2) to generate n-alkanes. The gasoline and diesel yields obtained were
only 1 and 3%, respectively, at 370 °C. The increase in the reaction
temperature significantly improved the deoxygenation activities. As
revealed in Table S2, the total product
yields increased from 4 to 22.3% with the temperature increasing from
370 to 430 °C. However, the decrease in the diesel yield from
10.1 to 8.8% on increasing the temperature from 400 to 430 °C
would be associated with the promotion of cracking due to the formation
of light hydrocarbons at a high reaction temperature (430 °C).
Therefore, the reaction temperature of 400 °C was chosen to investigate
the effect of Pt decoration on MoO2 by varying the Pt loading.

Figure 10 shows
the product yields and reaction rates over the bare MoO2 and Pt-decorated MoO2 catalysts. The solvent-free hydrodeoxygenation
reaction over all of the catalysts resulted in a 100% conversion of
triglycerides with different product yields (Figure 10a). Over all of the Pt-decorated catalysts,
the diesel- and gasoline-range n-alkane yields significantly
increased compared with that on bare MoO2, implying that
the hydrodeoxygenation reaction proceeded over Pt metallic sites accompanied
by MoO2 species in the presence of hydrogen. By comparing
the catalytic activities with various Pt loadings, the hydrodeoxygenation
activities in terms of total product yields decreased in the order
of 1%Pt/MoO2 (56.4%) > 2%Pt/MoO2 (55.2%)
> 3%Pt/MoO2 (54.5%) > 0.5%Pt/MoO2 (46.2%)
> MoO2 (18.4%). It should be noted that the increase
in Pt loading from 0.5 to 1% resulted in an increase of gasoline and
diesel yields probably due to the sufficient Pt loading and cooperative
effects between Pt and MoO2 phases. However, the further
increase in the Pt loading from 2 to 3% seemed to decrease the product
yields although the number of acidic sites significantly increased. This could be
due to the fact that the large amount of Pt is likely to partially
cover the active MoO2 sites, causing the agglomeration
of larger Pt particles, resulting in a reduction of the n-alkane production rate (see Figure 10b), which was calculated based on the summation of
desired products against the amount of catalyst and time.

Figure 10 (a) Gasoline
and diesel yields and (b) reaction rates over the MoO2,
0.5%Pt/MoO2, 1%Pt/MoO2, 2%Pt/MoO2, and 3%Pt/MoO2 catalysts. All experiments were conducted
at a temperature of 400 °C, an initial H2 pressure
of 40 bar, and a reaction time of 3 h.

Furthermore, the reusability of the 1%Pt/MoO2 catalyst
was investigated at a temperature of 400 °C, an initial H2 pressure of 40 bar, and a reaction time of 3 h. The spent
catalyst was rinsed with hexane to remove the oil product and dried
overnight at 100 °C before the second and third hydrodeoxygenation
tests. It was found that the triglyceride conversion remained constant
at 100%; meanwhile, the gasoline and diesel yields dropped after the
third consecutive experiment (see Figure S5a,b). The degradation of the catalyst after the first run was likely
due to the formation of organic impurities on the active sites during
the deoxygenation under solvent-free conditions.53

To evaluate
the hydrodeoxygenation behavior using the bare MoO2 and
Pt-decorated MoO2 catalysts, the percentage relative involvements
of HDO and DeCO/DeCO2 reactions are estimated and depicted
in Figure 11a. As
reported in the literature, DeCO and DeCO2 were the major
reaction pathways compared with HDO over the Pt-based catalysts.1 It was found that the percentage relative involvement
of DeCO/DeCO2 was significantly greater than that of HDO
over all of the catalysts, suggesting that DeCO and DeCO2 were the major reaction pathways for all of the catalysts. By comparison
with the percentage relative involvement of HDO, the bare MoO3 was highly selective to HDO among the other decorated catalysts.
The reducible transition metal oxides such as MoO3 and
MoO2 species have been suggested as the catalysts for C=O
and C–O bond scission in oxygenated biomass compounds toward
hydrodeoxygenation.37,38,54,55 In contrast, the addition of Pt into MoO2 resulted in a noteworthy increase in the percentage relative
involvement of DeCO and DeCO2, indicating that the active
Pt sites promoted the active MoO2 sites at higher Pt loading
(Figure 11a). As summarized
in Table S3, the C16 and C18 fatty acids are the major fatty acid components in the representative
triglycerides used in this study. Therefore, as demonstrated in Figure 11b, the n-alkanes of n-C15 and n-C17 were found as the major constituents of
the deoxygenated product due to the high selectivity of DeCO and DeCO2 reactions over the Pt-decorated MoO2 catalysts.

0.5%Pt/MoO2, 1%Pt/MoO2, 2%Pt/MoO2, and 3%Pt/MoO2 catalysts. All experiments were conducted
at a temperature of 400 °C, an initial H2 pressure
of 40 bar, and a reaction time of 3 h.

2.10 Deoxygenated Product Analysis by FTIR
To confirm the removal of oxygen atoms in refined palm oil, the functional
groups of the liquid products were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectroscopy (see Figure 12). The peaks at 1704 cm–1 in the
FTIR spectrum correspond to the carboxylic functional groups of fatty
acids. On the other hand, the carbonyl groups and ester groups of
triglycerides were detected in the FTIR spectrum at 1746 and 1165
cm–1, respectively.56 In the deoxygenation process, triglycerides were first hydrogenolyzed
to fatty acids and further deoxygenated to n-alkane.
Palmitic acid and stearic acid are major oxygenated intermediates
detected by GC–MS analysis. The FTIR spectrum of refined palm
oil exhibited the adsorption peaks corresponding to triglycerides.
Interestingly, for the liquid product after the deoxygenation process,
the peaks intensity of triglycerides and fatty acids in the FTIR spectrum
significantly decreased with an increase in the Pt loading. This result
confirmed that the triglyceride and fatty acids partially converted
into n-alkanes under solvent-free conditions via DeCO and DeCO2 reactions.

of 400 °C, an initial H2 pressure of 40 bar, and a
reaction time of 3 h.

3 Conclusions
We have successfully prepared the Pt-decorated MoO2 catalysts
with various Pt loadings (0.5–3%) by an incipient wetness impregnation
method and their catalytic activities for triglyceride hydrodeoxygenation
were investigated without solvent addition in a custom-made shaking-batch-type
reactor under the following operating conditions: temperature, 400
°C; initial H2 pressure, 40 bar; and reaction time,
3 h. Using XRD, XPS, and XANES investigations, it was confirmed that the
active components for hydrodeoxygenation under solvent-free conditions
were in the form of metallic Pt and MoO2 generated during
the reaction. The number of acidic sites obtained from NH3-TPD significantly increased by the addition of Pt species into the
MoO2 species. In addition, stronger metal–support
integration was achieved by Pt decoration. It was found that the catalytic
performance of MoO2 for triglyceride hydrodeoxygenation
was significantly improved by the decoration of a small amount of
Pt with the uniform distribution on the MoO2 phase. Moreover,
a large amount of Pt species cause a slight decrease in product yields,
suggesting that the excess Pt species are likely to partially cover
the active MoO2 sites and cause the agglomeration of larger
Pt particles. High decarbonylation (DeCO) and decarboxylation (DeCO2) activities, as the major pathways in the deoxygenation,
were observed, attributed to the moderate acidity from the Pt dispersed
on MoO2.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Catalyst Synthesis
Molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) was synthesized by dissolving 10 g of ammonium heptamolybdate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, Carlo Erba, purity 99.0%) in 50 mL of deionized water. Subsequently,
the resultant solution was heated and stirred at 110 °C until
a solid powder formed. The obtained solid was combusted at 350 °C
for 2 h. Finally, the obtained sample was calcined at 500 °C
for 5 h in stagnant air.

The various Pt loadings (0.5–3%)
decorated on as-prepared MoO3 catalysts were prepared by
an incipient wetness impregnation method using the corresponding Pt
precursor as 3.4 wt % diamminedinitritoplatinum(II) in dilute ammonium
hydroxide (Sigma Aldrich). The samples were dried at 110 °C after
impregnation overnight and subsequently calcined at 500 °C for
5 h in stagnant air.

4.2 Catalyst Characterizations
The specific surface area, total pore volume, and average pore
diameter of the as-synthesized samples before the reaction were determined
by a nitrogen adsorption and desorption technique at −196 °C
(BEL Japan, Bel Sorp mini II). The samples were degassed, and the
moisture content was removed at 150 °C for 12 h before N2 sorption implementation.

The phase identification of
as-synthesized samples before and after the deoxygenation tests was
confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) performed on an X-ray diffractometer
(D8 ADVANCE, Bruker, Ltd., Germany) using Cu Kα radiation over
the range of 10° < 2θ < 80°.

The form
of Pt decorated on MoO2 was quantitatively analyzed by
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a Kratos Axis ULTRADLD (Kratos) spectrometer equipped with an Al Kα radiation
source. The C 1s feature at 284.8 eV was used to calibrate the binding
energy of Pt 4f.

The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES)
was used to further investigate the Mo oxidation state. XANES spectra
at the Mo L3-edge (2500–2550 eV) were acquired in
the transmission mode at Beamline 8 of the Synchrotron Light Research
Institute (SLRI), Thailand,57 using InSb(111)
double-crystal monochromators for scanning the photon energy. Normalization
of the XANES spectra was performed using the ATHENA program.58

The H2 temperature-programmed
reduction (H2-TPR) was performed to investigate support–metal
interactions using BELCAT-B Instruments, Japan, using approximately
100 mg of calcined samples. To remove the moisture content, the samples
were first heated to 190 °C for 30 min under an inert gas before
H2-TPR implementation. The reduction behavior was analyzed
by the temperature-programmed method using a 5 vol % H2/Ar at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 in the
temperature range of 100–1000 °C. The H2 consumption
was recorded using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).

The
acidity of the synthesized catalysts was determined by NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) technique
using the same instrument as for H2-TPR. The samples were
initially pre-reduced at 400 °C for 2 h in 5 vol % H2/Ar to transform the surface PtOx into
Pt phases. NH3 adsorption was subsequently conducted for
2 h after cooling the samples to 50 °C in an inert gas, followed
by the excess NH3 removal under the supply of He for 1
h. The temperature-programmed desorption was carried out in the range
of 50–400 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 under the supply of He. The peak intensity from a thermal conductivity
detector (TCD) was used to calculate the number of acidic sites from
the amount of NH3 desorption compared with the NH3 standard.

The morphologies of the catalysts before and after
the reaction were examined by field-emission scanning electron microscopy
(FE-SEM) on a JEOL, JSM-7600F, instrument equipped with an energy-dispersive
X-ray spectrometer (EDS; X-MaxN 50, Oxford Instruments).

The particle size distribution and morphology of the Pt-decorated
catalyst after the reaction were observed by field-emission transmission
electron microscopy (FE-TEM) at 300 kV on a JEOL, JEM-3100F, instrument.
The sample preparation was performed by dispersing the catalyst powder
in ethanol for 20 min under ultrasonic conditions and subsequently
dropping the solution on a carbon-coated Cu grid at least three times.

4.3 Catalytic Deoxygenation Evaluation
A locally
available refined palm oil with a low free-fatty-acid content was
employed as a model compound for triglycerides, and their catalytic
deoxygenations under solvent-free conditions were conducted in a stainless-steel
shaking-batch-type reactor with an internal volume of 10 cm3. The fatty acid compositions of the feedstock were experimentally
determined via the transesterification of refined
palm oil with methanol over a sodium phosphate (NaPO4)
catalyst corresponding to the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) composition.
The fatty acid compositions are listed in Table S3. In the deoxygenation activity evaluation, 2 g of refined
palm oil with 20 wt % as-synthesized catalysts without the pre-reduction
process was loaded into the stainless-steel reactor. Subsequently,
the air inside the reactors was removed to prevent explosion and oil
combustion by H2 purging three times, and they were pressurized
to an initial H2 pressure of 40 bar. The sealed reactors
were immediately placed into an electric furnace at an operating temperature
of 400 °C for 3 h with a shaking speed of 150 rpm to minimize
the effect of mass transfer resistance. After the hydrodeoxygenation
test, the reactor was suddenly stopped by subjecting the reaction
to initial conditions by quenching in an ice-cool bath. The experiments
were conducted in duplicate and the average values are presented.

4.4 Analysis of the Deoxygenated Liquid Product
The deoxygenated liquid products were filtrated to remove the catalyst
and were subsequently analyzed by a gas chromatography (GC) system
equipped and a flame ionization detector (FID) (Clarus 580, Perkin
Elmer) with a capillary column (DB-1HT, 30 m × 0.32 mm ×
0.1 μm). The quantities of n-alkanes ranging
from n-C8 to n-C18 and unreacted triglycerides (TGs) in the liquid product
were calculated using the calibration curves of n-alkane and triglyceride standards. The GC conditions were similar
to those of a previous study.1,7,11 The triglyceride conversion, gasoline yield, and diesel yield were
defined by the following equations 1   2   3  To directly evaluate the involvement of hydrodeoxygenation (HDO),
decarbonylation, and decarboxylation (DeCO/DeCO2) reactions,
the percent relative involvements of HDO and DeCO/DeCO2 reactions were calculated using eqs 4 and 5. 4   5  In addition, the n-alkane
product distribution of each component was calculated according to
a previous study52 using eq 6. 6  Furthermore, to confirm the
deoxygenation activities under solvent-free conditions, the functional
groups of the refined palm oil, n-alkane standard,
and products were identified by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectroscopy (Jasco FT/IR 6800).
