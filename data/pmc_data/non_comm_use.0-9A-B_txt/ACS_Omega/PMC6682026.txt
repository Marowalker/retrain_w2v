Multicomponent self-assembly of Mn2(CO)10, a bis-chelating aminoquinonato (ON∩ON)
bridge (L), and an
ester/amide-functionalized flexible neutral ditopic linker (L′)
has resulted into the formation of M2LL′-type manganese(I)-based
dinuclear metallastirrups of general formula [{(CO)3Mn(μ-η4-L)Mn(CO)3}(μ-L′)] (1–10). Compounds 1–10 were accomplished via orthogonal bonding of the aminoquinone ligand
(2,5-bis(n-butylamino)-1,4-benzoquinone/2,5-bis(phenethylamino)-1,4-benzoquinone)
and ditopic pyridyl ligand to manganese carbonyl. The resultant metallastirrups
were characterized using elemental analyses and IR, UV–vis, 1H NMR, and electrospray ionization-mass spectroscopic techniques.
The molecular structure of 6 was confirmed by single-crystal
X-ray diffraction methods. Furthermore, molecular recognition capabilities
of 1, 5, 7, and 9 were evaluated with aromatic compounds containing hydroxy/amine
functionalities. Anticancer activities of compounds 1−3, 5−7, 9, and 10 were investigated against three cancer
cell lines, that is, lung (A549), colon (HCT-15), and cervical (HeLa)
as well as on normal cells (HEK 293). Compound 9 showed
a broad-spectrum inhibition toward these cancer cells upon exposure
to visible light. The myoglobin assay was performed using UV–vis
absorption spectroscopy to investigate the visible-light-triggered
CO release from 5 and 9 that could be related
to their ability to effectively inhibit cancer cells. In addition,
morphological studies confirmed the induction of autophagy due to
the treatment of cancer cells using compound 9.

Introduction
Coordination-driven
self-assembly is widely employed for the construction
of topologically significant and aesthetically appealing supramolecules.1 The synthetic principles for the generation of
self-assembled nanoscale coordination architectures are now well established.
Metallasupramolecules thus developed have garnered a great deal of
interest due to their ease of construction from simple complementary
metal–ligand precursors and functionality offered by the building
blocks.2 It is well-known that the ligating
topologies of the organic ligands used in metal-mediated self-assembly
play a key role in determining the binding abilities, size, geometry,
and functionality of resulting metallasupramolecular objects.3 It is a continuous endeavor to diversify the
choice of chelating linkers and to functionalize the resulting complexes
to achieve supramolecular architectures with interesting properties.4 Recently, researchers have focused on developing
different varieties of fac-Re(CO)3- and fac-Mn(CO)3-based compounds for their probable
utility as CO releasing molecules and studied their related antiproliferative
properties.5,6

A survey on the literature related
to photo-carbon monoxide releasing
molecules (photo-CORMs) disclosed that the photo-CORMs requiring high-energy
UV light to initiate the CO release process have been well explored
and the mechanism of photo-triggered CO release is also understood.7 However, considering the harmful effects of UV
light on biological tissues, molecules requiring UV light activation
for CO release might have limited applicability in therapeutic use.8 Therefore, designing of photo-CORMs that can
be stimulated with visible light for controlled release of CO is highly
desirous and is also a key challenge.9

We envisioned that incorporation of an organic bridge with more
conjugation, in the design of Mn-based compounds, could result in
a red shift of the metal–ligand charge transfer (MLCT) band.
The choice of aminoquinonato bridge for this purpose was driven by
the fact that some of our previous examples based on Re–aminoquinonato
complexes showed increased absorptivity with a concomitant red shift
of the MLCT band.10 To the best of our
knowledge, compounds 1–10 are the
first report of heteroleptic (M2LL′) Mn(I)-based
dinuclear metallastirrups comprising an aminoquinonato bridge and
ester/amide-functionalized flexible tectons. Herein, we present the
self-assembly of Mn(I)-based ester/amide-functionalized dinuclear
metallastirrups with the general formula [{(CO)3Mn(μ-η4-L)Mn(CO)3}(μ-L′)] (1–10), where L is a bis-chelated aminoquinone
ligand and L′ is a ester/amide-functionalized dinucleating
bispyridyl ligand. Compounds 1–10 were characterized based on elemental analysis and IR, UV–vis,
NMR, and electrospray ionization (ESI)-mass spectroscopic techniques,
and the molecular structure of 6 was determined using
single-crystal X-ray diffraction methods. Molecular recognition capabilities
of compounds 1, 5, 7, and 9 were evaluated using ester/amide -containing aromatic compounds
such as 4,4′-dihydroxybiphenyl and benzidine. Furthermore,
the anticancer and visible-light [light-emitting diode (LED) green
light]-triggered CO releasing properties were studied.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of Mn(I)-based ester/amide-functionalized dinuclear metallastirrups
of general formula [{(CO)3Mn(μ-η4-L)Mn(CO)3}(μ-L′)] (1–10) was achieved via an orthogonal bonding approach. A typical
one-pot self-assembly process involved the reaction of an equimolar
mixture of Mn2(CO)10, bis-chelated aminoquinone
ligands [L = 2,5-bis(n-butylamino)-1,4-benzoquinone
(bbbq), 2,5-bis(phenethylamino)-1,4-benzoquinone (bpbq)], and ester/amide-functionalized
dinucleating bispyridyl ligands [L′ = ethane diyl di-4-pyridine
carboxylate (etdp), 4-pyridinecarboxylic acid diethylene glycol diester
(pcadgd), 1,2-phenylene diisonicotinate (pdi), N,N′-bis(4-pyridinecarboxamide)-1,2-ethane (bpce),
and 1,2-phenylene diisonicotinamide (pdia)] in the presence of Me3NO in dichloromethane medium at 25–30 °C for 35–40
h under dark conditions (Scheme 1). The products obtained were stable toward air and
moisture but sensitive to exposure of light. Compounds 1–10 were soluble in polar organic solvents and
have been characterized by elemental analysis and IR, UV–vis
absorption, NMR, and ESI-mass spectroscopic techniques. The molecular
structure of compound 6•acetone was confirmed
using single-crystal X-ray diffraction methods.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Mn(I)-Based
Ester/Amide-Functionalized Dinuclear Metallastirrups 1–10
IR spectra of 1–10 in CH2Cl2/THF showed
strong bands for the fac-Mn(CO)3 core
in the range of ν 2031–1890
cm–1. Compounds 1–10 have a formal local symmetry lower than Cs and displayed two overlapping high-energy and two overlapping low-energy
bands. These four infrared stretching frequencies were indicative
of the lowering of symmetry, which resulted into the completely nondegenerate
modes (4A).11 The amide
C=O stretching frequency of the bis-chelated aminoquinonato
moiety appeared as a weak band at around ν 1536–1531
cm–1, whereas the corresponding C=O stretching
frequency of free aminoquinone ligands (H2L) appeared at
ν 1553 cm–1. The shift in the C=O stretching
frequency toward the lower-energy side and the disappearance of the
NH band of aminoquinone ligands in 1–10 indicated the coordination of aminoquinone ligands with two manganese
centers. The ester C=O stretching band in 1–6 appeared as a medium band in the range ν 1761–1729
cm–1, and the amide C=O stretching frequency
of the bipyridyl linker in 7–10 appeared
as a medium band in the range of 1681–1611 cm–1 (Figure S1, Supporting Information).
UV–vis absorption spectra of 1–10 displayed intense bands in the higher-energy regions at λmax = 228–311 and 324–344 nm due to ligand-centered
transitions and intraligand charge transfer (ILCT) transitions, respectively.
In addition, toward the lower-energy region, intense broad bands were
observed in the range λmax = 465–486 nm, whereas
the free ligands were transparent in the corresponding window. The
appearance of these new bands in the complexes was assigned to MLCT
transitions (Figure S2, Supporting Information).12

1H NMR spectra of compounds 1–10 showed appropriate signals for the
ester/amide-functionalized
dipyridyl linkers, and the spectral data are given in the Experimental Section. The signals corresponding
to the bispyridyl linker were downfield-shifted (Figures S4–S10, Supporting Information). The formation
of compounds 1–10 was further confirmed
by the ESI-mass spectroscopic technique. The experimental isotopic
distribution pattern was distinctly observed and isotopically resolved.
The observed pattern matched well with the theoretical isotopic distribution
pattern. Further, the appearance of molecular ion peaks for 1–10 at the expected value (Experimental Section) supported the intact existence of the
compounds in solution (Figures S11–S20, Supporting Information). The elemental compositions for compounds 1–10 were ascertained by elemental analyses,
and the obtained results were satisfactory.

Good-quality single-crystals
of 6 were obtained by
slow evaporation of the mixture of acetone and dimethylformamide (2:1)
solutions at −40 °C. Compound 6•acetone
crystallized in the monoclinic space group C2/c. Details about data collection, solution, and structure
refinement are given in Table S1, Supporting
Information. The Oak Ridge thermal ellipsoid plot (ORTEP) diagram
of 6•acetone is depicted in Figure 1. The single-crystal X-ray structure of 6 showed a metallacyclic structure, wherein two manganese
centers are bridged by a bis-chelated bpbq unit and further linked
by the pdi unit. The coordination geometry around Mn(I) centers was
found to be a distorted octahedron, with facially disposed three terminal
carbonyl groups, one nitrogen atom, an oxygen atom from the aminoquinonato
bpbq linker, and one nitrogen atom from the pyridyl unit of the pdi
linker. The dianionic symmetrical bis-chelating bpbq ligands are in
a nearly planar arrangement, and phenethyl groups of aminoquinonato
bridge are positioned in an opposite manner with respect to each other.
Two ester C=O groups are oriented anti with respect to each
other. The distance between the Mn···Mn centers along
the aminoquinonato pillar is ∼7.86 Å. The centroid···centroid
distance between pyridyl moieties of the pdi unit was found to be
5.62 Å and that between the central phenyl moiety of the pdi
unit and the central benzoquinone moiety of bpbq is 9.166 Å.
An acetone molecule was trapped outside of the crystal lattice. The
crystal packing diagram of 6•acetone along the b axis displayed various soft intramolecular and intermolecular
interactions, as shown in Figure 2. Compound 6 showed intermolecular hydrogen-bonding
interactions between (i) the acetone carbonyl group and phenyl group
of the bpbq unit, i.e., C=O···H–C with
a distance of 2.658 Å, (ii) the acetone methyl group and ethereal
linkage of the ester group from the pdi unit, i.e., −CH···OC=O
with a distance of 2.715 Å, and (iii) the terminal manganese
carbonyl group and the phenyl group of the bpbq unit, i.e., C≡O···H–C
with a distance of 2.673 Å.13 Notably,
two different weak mutual CH···π interactions
were observed between (i) the methyl group present in the acetone
moiety and the phenyl group present in the pdi unit with a distance
of 3.657 Å and (ii) the pyridyl group present in the pdi unit
and the phenyl group present in the bpbq unit with a distance of 3.674
Å.14 The packing diagrams of 6•acetone along the a and c axes are shown in Figure S3, Supporting Information.

The assemblage of different functional
groups in the metallastirrups
and the observance of various soft interactions in the X-ray crystal
structure of 6 induced us to study the molecular recognition
capability of the aminoquinonato-bridged metallastirrups with aromatic
compounds in its solution state. Absorption and emission spectrophotometric
titration methods were adapted for quantitative evaluation of the
binding affinity of Mn(I)-based compounds, and 4,4′-dihydroxybiphenyl
and benzidine were used as guest species in the titration experiments.
In a typical experiment, the concentration of guest [G] was maintained
constant, while the concentration of the host [H] (1, 5, 7, and 9, respectively) was varied.
In the UV–vis absorption spectrum, the intensity of bands corresponding
to guests enhanced upon addition of hosts, due to formation of a host–guest
charge transfer complex. A linear correlation resulted from a Benesi–Hildebrand
double-reciprocal plot of change in intensity of guest absorption
(1/ΔA taken along the Y axis)
at a given wavelength versus change in host concentration (1/[H] taken
along the X axis).  To further support the formation of a host–guest
complex, emission titration experiments were performed. In these experiments,
the intensity of emission bands owing to guests was quenched upon
incremental addition of respective host metallastirrups. The Stern–Volmer
constants, Ksv, were calculated from the
linear plot of Iο/I versus concentration of host [H], where I and Iο are fluorescent intensities of the guest
in the presence and absence of the host. The following Stern–Volmer
equation was adapted for the calculations.16  The binding
and Stern–Volmer constants
furnished in Table 1 indicated efficient binding of guest molecules by the metallastirrup
hosts. The observed spectral patterns for the
titration experiments are given in Figures S21–S28, Supporting Information.

The anticancer efficacy of
metallastirrup compounds 1–3, 5–7, 9, and 10 was studied against a series of cancer
cell lines, namely, lung (A549), colon (HCT-15), cervical (HeLa),
and normal human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293). The cancer cells
were exposed to the compounds 1–3, 5–7, 9, and 10, and the ability of cancer cells to survive in the presence
of these compounds at variable concentrations was investigated using
the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
assay. The above-mentioned compounds were inactive against the cancer
cells under dark conditions, whereas upon exposure to visible light,
they showed significant inhibition of cancer cells in a differential
and dose-dependent manner (Figures S29–S44, Supporting Information). As shown in Figures S29, S31, S33, S35, S37, S39, S41, and S43, the dose-dependent
inhibition of the compounds with cancer cells was observed. The percentage
reduction in cell viability were found to be approximately 83, 92,
77, and 34% at a maximum concentration of 50 μM on lung (A549),
colon (HCT-15), cervical (HeLa), and normal human embryonic kidney
cells (HEK 293) for compound 1 (Figures S30, S32, S34, S36, S38, S40, S42, S44, and Table 3). Among the compounds screened, 7 and 9 were more potent in inhibiting the proliferation
of lung, colon, and cervical cancer cells with IC50 values
of 2.89 ± 0.12, 4.43 ± 0.62, 0.98 ± 0.38 μM and
2.34 ± 0.1, 2.58 ± 0.57, 0.78 ± 0.03 μM, respectively
(Table 2). The inhibitory
potency grade of the dinuclear metallastirrup series increased as 3 < 5 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 7 < 9 < 10 as assessed in cancer cell lines. Indeed, compound 9 showed broad-spectrum activity with significantly low IC50 values toward lung, colon, and cervical cancer cells lines
in comparison to cisplatin.

Furthermore, live cell imaging and AO/EB staining
were employed
to study the morphology of cancer cells treated with compound 9. The morphological analysis of control and compound 9-treated cells showed vacuolization, cell shrinkage, and
floating dead cells (Figure 3a). The distinct vacuoles and cell shrinkage indicate that
the nature of cell death might be due to autophagy.15 The AO/EB fluorescence staining showed uniform green color,
indicating live cells, while the dead cells were stained orange due
to ethidium bromide (Figure 3b).16a The probable reason behind
the antiproliferative effect of these metallastirrup compounds is
due to the CO release and the formation of photoproducts upon exposure
to light.5a,5b,5i,16b,16c Although suppression
of cancer cells subsequent to CO delivery using light stimulus (such
compounds are called photo-CORMs) is documented in the literature,
photo-CORMs that can be activated with visible light are relatively
rare. Our earlier work involving photo-CORMs required UV light (λmax = 365 nm) to trigger CO release, whereas inclusion of the
aminoquinonato bridge in the metallastirrup compounds presented here
has resulted in a considerable red shift of the MLCT band (λmax = 486 nm), which allowed activation of the photo-CORMs
using visible light. The red shift in the MLCT band can be attributed
to the conjugation present in the aminoquinonato bridge.

Figure 3 (a) Morphological
observations of the lung, colon, and cervical
cells treated with respective IC50 concentrations of 9, showing floating dead cells in live cell imaging (left)
and (b) the presence of dead cells (violet arrows) in acridine orange/ethidium
bromide (AO/EB) staining (right) after 48 h.

These compounds are generally stable at room temperature
in both
solid and solution states under dark conditions. For example, compounds 5 and 9 remained stable even after 24 and 12
h in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/H2O (8:2) under dark conditions.
The LED green-light-triggered CO release by compounds 5 and 9 was then studied using the standard myoglobin
(Mb) assay by the UV–vis absorption spectroscopic method. In
addition, the stability of compounds 5 and 9 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH = 7.4) under the reduced conditions
of the myoglobin assay was monitored using the UV–vis absorption
spectroscopic method. Compounds 5 and 9 showed
negligible spectral changes over 24 and 12 h, respectively. Four different
wavelengths, namely, λmax = 510, 540, 556, and 577
nm, were chosen to observe the stability of the compounds. This indicates
that no CO release occurred during this time under dark conditions,
suggesting that these compounds may be suitable for photoactivatable
CO release (photo-CORM) (Figures 4 and S45).

Figure 4 UV–vis absorption
spectral changes at a selected wavelength
with increasing incubation time under dark conditions for a solution
of reduced equine heart myoglobin and compound 5 in phosphate
buffer.

To ascertain CO release from the
metallastirrups, compound 9 was chosen for myoglobin
assay experiments. Compound 9 was added to a buffered
aqueous solution of equine heart
myoglobin (MbFe(II)) that was freshly reduced with excess sodium dithionite
under a nitrogen atmosphere. Compound 9 was stable in
the absence of light, whereas CO release was found to be photochemically
triggered, upon exposure to LED green light (λ = 520–560
nm, 220–240 V, 0.5 W). The spectral variations in the Q-band
region of MbFe(II) upon exposure to LED green light are shown in Figure 5. The photoirradiation
was carried out at a 30 min interval. The intensity of the band at
λmax = 557 nm gradually decreased, whereas two bands
at λmax = 542 and 577 nm increased in intensity.
These changes in bands were due to formation of the MbFeCO complex.
The formation of the MbFeCO complex completed in 4 h, beyond which
there were no changes in the spectral pattern. The myoglobin assay
carried out for compound 5, which is different from 9 only in terms of the ester-based flexible linker, also displayed
CO releasing characteristics upon exposure to LED green light (λ
= 520–560 nm, 220–240 V, 0.5 W). However, in the presence
of compound 5, formation of MbFeCO was complete only
in 10 h, indicating a slower kinetics for CO release. The structural
difference between 5 and 9 is only the ester/amide
functionality, although it is not clear, at this stage, if this could
be the reason for difference in their CO releasing abilities. However,
this observance does indicate that there could be opportunities for
temporally controlled release of CO for a specific duration by structural
modifications (Figure 5).

Figure 5 UV–vis absorption spectral changes in the Q-band region
of a solution of reduced equine heart myoglobin and compounds 5 and 9 in phosphate buffer under LED green light
exposure observed for every (a) 1 h and (b) 30 min.

When 4 μM compounds 5 and 9 were
added to 66 μM deoxymyoglobin, the CO release profiles of 5 and 9 were accomplished upon exhaustive photoactivation.
The concentration of MbCO was obtained from the absorption data, which
indicates that approximately two CO molecules, i.e., 1.73 ± 0.21
and 1.87 ± 0.05, were released per molecule of 5 and 9 with half-life (t1/2) values of 9.21 × 102 and 3.27 × 102 min, respectively (Figures 6 and S46 and Table 4). In this study, t1/2 is defined as the time taken by the compounds 5 and 9 to release 50% of CO per molecule. The values
of the apparent rate of CO release by 5 and 9 determined by the logarithmic plot of absorption of 5 and 9 against irradiation time were found to be 7.53
× 10–4 and 2.12 × 10–3 s–1, respectively (Figures 7 and S47 and Table 4).

The photolytic CO release by compounds 5 and 9 was further confirmed by the solution
IR spectroscopic method.
The IR spectra of compounds 5 and 9 (in
DMSO) upon irradiation with LED green light (λ = 520–560
nm) exhibited strong CO stretching modes for the terminal CO groups
between ν 2031 and 1890 cm–1 under dark conditions.
A remarkable reduction in the intensity for the terminal CO groups
of 5 was observed progressively. However, beyond 10 h,
no further changes were observed. However, for compound 9, a dramatic change happened very quickly (4 h), beyond which there
were no changes in the spectral pattern (Figures 8 and S48).

Experimental Section
General Methods
All reactions were carried out under
an oxygen-free, N2 atmosphere using standard Schlenk line
techniques. The starting materials were purchased from Alfa-Aesar
and Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals. Mn2(CO)10, trimethylamine-N-oxide, isonicotinoyl chloride hydrochloride, 1,2-ethanediol,
1,2-dihydroxybenzene, diethylene glycol, 1,2-ethylene diamine, 1,4-phenylenediamine, p-benzoquinone, n-butylamine, and phenethylamine
were used as received. The aminoquinone ligands (bbbq and bpbq) and
ditopic pyridyl ligands (etdp, pcadgd, pdi, bpce, and pdia) were synthesized
as reported in the literature.17 Dichloromethane,
ethanol, methanol, tetrahydrofuran, and other solvents were dried

Synthesis of [{(CO)3Mn(μ-η4-L)Mn(CO)3}(μ-L′)] (1–10)
A mixture of Mn2(CO)10 (0.1
mmol), aminoquinone ligand (L) (0.1 mmol), and ester/amide-functionalized
bispyridyl ligand (L′) (0.1 mmol) was taken in a Schlenk flask
with a magnetic pellet. The system was evacuated and purged with nitrogen.
To this, freshly distilled dichloromethane (10 mL) was added under
a positive pressure of nitrogen gas using a vacuum Schlenk line. The
reaction mixture was stirred by a magnetic stirrer at room temperature
(25–30 °C) for 35–40 h. The color of the reaction
mixture changed from dark red to dark maroon. The solvent was removed
under vacuum and washed with hexane to remove unreacted Mn2(CO)10. The reaction mixture was filtered through a silica
gel column using dichloromethane to remove unreacted trimethylamine-N-oxide. The products were isolated as a maroon solid of
[{(CO)3Mn(μ-η4-L)Mn(CO)3}(μ-L′)] and dried under vacuum.

(27 mg, 0.1 mmol) and trimethylamine-N-oxide (0.2
mmol) were taken in a Schlenk flask equipped with a magnetic stirring
bar. The system was evacuated and purged with nitrogen using a vacuum
Schlenk line. To this, freshly distilled dichloromethane (12 mL) was
added, and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for
40 h. The color of the reaction mixture changed to dark maroon from
dark red. The solvent was removed by vacuum distillation, and the
reaction mixture was washed with hexane and filtered through a short
silica gel column. The product was isolated as a dark maroon solid
of [{(CO)3Mn(μ-η4-bbbq)Mn(CO)3}(μ-etdp)] (1) and dried under vacuum.

Single-Crystal X-ray Diffraction
Studies
Good-quality
crystals of 6 suitable for single-crystal X-ray structure
analysis were grown by slow evaporation of a concentrated solution
of the compound in acetone and dimethylformamide at −40 °C.
Single-crystal X-ray structural studies were performed on a Bruker
AXS Kappa APEX3 CMOS diffractometer with a low-temperature attachment.
Crystal data were collected at 200(2) K using graphite-monochromated
Mo Kα radiation (λα = 0.71073 Å).
The strategy for the data collection was evaluated using CrysAlisPro
CCD software. The data were collected by the standard “ψ
– ω scan” techniques and were scaled and reduced
using CrysAlisPro RED software. The structures were solved by direct
methods (SHELXS) and refined by full-matrix least-squares calculations
on F2 (SHELXL).19 The positions on all of the atoms were obtained by direct methods.
All nonhydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. The hydrogen atoms
were placed in geometrically constrained positions and refined with
isotropic temperature factors, generally 1.2 × Ueq of their parent atoms.

cells were maintained in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) supplemented
with 10% FBS and antibiotic–antimycotic solution (1X). The
cells were maintained as a monolayer, passaged on reaching 80% confluency,
and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator.

Antiproliferative
Activity Studies
The cytotoxicity
of the complexes was analyzed using the MTT assay.7 Cancer cells (lung and cervical) and normal cells were
suspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS at a density of 10 000
cells per well in a 96-well plate and incubated overnight. Colon cancer
cells were suspended in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS and plated
as mentioned above. The compounds were irradiated with common household
LED light of λ ≥ 560 nm for 1 h. Different concentrations
of the photolyzed compounds 1–3, 5–7, 9, and 10 (2, 5, 10, 25, 50 μM) were treated in triplicates and incubated
for 48 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Then, 10
μL of MTT (5 mg/mL) was added to the wells and incubated for
3 h. The medium was discarded, and the formazan product was dissolved
in 100 μL of DMSO. The plates were read at λ = 595 nm
using a Dynex multimode plate reader. The IC50 values were
calculated using nonlinear regression fit from GraphPad prism 5.0
software. Data were represented as the average and standard error
of three independent assays.

Morphological Observations
The cancer
cells were seeded
at a density of 50 000 cells/mL and incubated overnight in
a CO2 incubator.20 The cells
were treated with IC50 concentration of 9 and
incubated for 48 h. After incubation, the cells were observed for
any morphological changes under a phase contrast microscope. Further,
the cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS, further stained with
acridine orange/ethidium bromide at a final concentration of 1 μg/mL,
and viewed under a Nikon eclipse 80i fluorescent microscope for cell
death.

Myoglobin Assay
The CO release by the compounds 5 and 9 was studied using the myoglobin assay.21 Equine heart myoglobin (66 μM) was obtained
by dissolving in 890 μL of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4).
Then, 0.1% of 100 μL of freshly prepared sodium dithionite dissolved
in PBS was added to reduce the myoglobin to its deoxy form. The deoxymyoglobin
curve was recorded using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu
UV-2450) at room temperature using a quartz cuvette at a range of
λ = 500–600 nm. Then, 10 μL of 5 in
DMSO was added to give a final concentration of 4 μM. When compound 5 was added to deoxymyoglobin under dark conditions, it remained
stable and therefore the solution was exposed to LED green light.
The system was positioned in a cardboard box to protect from any unwanted
lights, and the quartz cuvette containing the solution was placed
in front of the light source (LED green light (λ = 520–560
nm, 220–240 V, 0.5 W)) with a distance of 10 cm. After irradiation,
there was a substantial change observed in the deoxyMb absorption
band. The absorption spectra were recorded for 10 h at regular intervals
of 1 h and subjected to LED green light exposure until the saturated
curve was observed. When compound 9 was added to deoxymyoglobin
under dark conditions, it remained stable and therefore the solution
was subjected to LED green light exposure and there was a change observed
in the deoxyMb absorption band. The absorption spectra were recorded
at regular intervals of 30 min of visible light exposure up to 4 h.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated and successfully
synthesized
a series of functionalized neutral Mn(I)-based aminoquinonato-bridged
dinuclear metallastirrups with flexible pyridyl ligands. The manganese(I)-based
dinuclear compounds were obtained in a one-pot reaction condition
via the orthogonal bonding approach. The compounds were characterized
by IR, UV–vis, 1H NMR, and ESI-mass spectroscopic
techniques. The molecular structure of 6 was ascertained
by single-crystal X-ray diffraction methods. The molecular recognition
capabilities of compounds 1, 5, 7, and 9 were studied with aromatic compounds containing
ester and amide functionalities. The cytotoxicity studies were performed
for the compounds 1–3, 5–7, 9, and 10 against
lung, colon, and cervical cancer cells as well as normal cells. Compound 9 showed better cytotoxic activity in comparison with cisplatin.
Visible light-triggered CORMs were identified by the myoglobin assay
for the compounds 5 and 9. Compound 9 released CO much faster than the compound 5 probably due to the amide functionality.
