Translation elongation factor-1alpha
(EF-1α) or its paralog
elongation factor-like proteins (EFL) interact with an aminoacyl-transfer
RNA (aa-tRNA) to play its essential role in elongation of peptide-chain
during protein synthesis. Species usually have either an EF-1α
or EFL protein; however, some species have both EF-1α and EFL
(dual-EF-containing species). In the dual-EF-containing species, EF-1α
appeared to be highly divergent in the sequence. Homology modeling
and surface analysis of EF-1α and EFL were performed to examine
the hypothesis that the divergent EF-1α in the dual-EF-containing
eukaryotes does not strongly interact with aa-tRNA compared to the
canonical EF-1α and EFL. The subsequent molecular dynamics simulations
were carried out to confirm the validity of modeled structures and
to analyze their stability. It was found that the molecular surfaces
of the divergent EF-1α proteins were negatively charged partly,
and thus they might not interact with negatively charged aa-tRNA as
strongly as the canonical ones. The molecular docking simulations
between EF-1α/EFL and aa-tRNA also support the hypothesis.

Introduction
Translation
elongation factor-1alpha (EF-1α or EF1A), the
eukaryotic (and archaebacterial) counterpart to elongation factor
Tu (EF-Tu) in bacteria, interacts with aminoacyl-transfer RNAs (aa-tRNAs)
in a guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding-dependent manner, and delivers
them to the acceptor site of the 80S ribosome.1,2 Due
to high conservation at the amino acid sequence coupled with ubiquitous
distribution in eukaryotes, EF-1α has been considered as one
of the major phylogenetic markers,3−5 and models for assessing
functional divergence in protein evolution.6,7 Besides
the essential role in translation described above, EF-1α is
known to be involved in diverse cellular processes also known as moonlighting
functions, such as cytoskeletal remodeling, protein folding and degradation,
proteolysis, cell signaling modulation, control of cell growth, nuclear
export processes, apoptosis, and cell cycle.8−10 For instance,
two EF-1α isoforms in human, which share 98% similarity at the
amino acid sequence, were found to have distinct arbitrary functions,
one involved in apoptosis and the other in cancer development.11

Recent massive accumulation of sequencing
data from phylogenetically
diverse eukaryotes has raised a question on the ubiquity of EF-1α
in eukaryotes. Some eukaryotes appeared to lack EF-1α but a
distinct paralog, i.e., elongation factor-like protein (EFL), has
been identified.12 The surveys of EF-1α/EFL
genes13−20 classified eukaryotes into three types, namely “EF-1α-containing”,
“EFL-containing”, and “dual-EF-containing”—the
species using only EF-1α belong to the first type, whereas those
using only EFL belong to the second type. So far, dual-EF-containing
species, in which both EF-1α and EFL genes were found, are highly
restricted among eukaryotes. The distribution of EF-1α/EFL can
be explained by “differential loss” hypothesis, which
assumes that the two elongation factors were present in the ancestral
eukaryote and losses of one of the two proteins occurred on separate
branches of the eukaryotic tree.16−19 According to this hypothesis,
dual-EF-containing species corresponds to the ancestral state, implying
that these types of eukaryotes provide insights into the early molecular
evolution of EF-1α/EFL.15,19,21,22 Although EF-1α and EFL
are functionally equivalent to one another as a GTPase in translation,
the two factors most likely recycle guanosine-5′-diphosphate
(GDP) to GTP in distinct approaches. In EF-1α-containing species,
EF-1α (henceforth designated as “solo-EF-1α”)
interacts with its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), EF-1β,
to recycle GDP to GTP.23 Nevertheless,
EF-1β is unlikely to be the GEF for EFL, as EFL-containing species
lack EF-1β with a few exceptions.15,22 Consistent
with the observation described above, a study incorporating a homology
model of EFL proposed that EFL can recharge GTP with no GEF.22

In the dual-EF-containing species known
to date, not both EF-1α
and EFL unlikely participate in the elongation step in translation,
as EF-1α appeared to be highly divergent at the amino acid sequence
level and transcriptionally suppressed compared to the co-occurring
EFL genes. The results from pioneering studies imply that dual-EF-containing
species use EFL for translation, whereas the divergent EF-1α
(henceforth designated as “div-EF-1α”) is in charge
of arbitrary functions involved in nontranslational cellular processes.19 In another word, div-EF-1α in dual-EF-containing
species are expected to not necessarily bind to and deliver aa-tRNAs
to the ribosomes, which are the principal functions of solo-EF-1α
and EFL. In addition, no case of co-occurrence of div-EF-1α
and EF-1β has been found in eukaryotes,22 implying that div-EF-1α lacks EF-1β-binding capacity
for GDP/GTP recycling. Nevertheless, there is no study that characterized
the putative functions of div-EF-1α. We here report the results
from comparative studies between solo-EF-1α/EFL and div-EF-1α
by combining in silico structural modeling, molecular dynamics (MD)
simulation, molecular surface analyses and molecular docking simulation.
The structural models of EF-1α and EFL were then employed to
molecular surface analyses and molecular docking simulations to evaluate
whether div-EF-1α binds to aa-tRNAs or EF-1β.19

Results and Discussion
Homology Modeling
Three-dimensional structures of EF-1α
and EFL proteins were constructed by the SWISS-MODEL web server24 using the three templates (PDB ID: 1G7C,234C0S,25 and 3WXM(26)). Tables S1–S3 show the sequence identities
with the templates and the scores estimating the quality of the homology
models. A qualitative model energy analysis (QMEAN) Z-score provides an estimate of the absolute quality of a model and
indicates whether the quality of the generated model is comparable
to the experimental structures, whereas QMEAN4 is a linear combination
of the four statistical potential scores.27,28 A global model quality estimation (GMQE) score reflects the expected
accuracy of the alignment and is expressed as a number between 0 and
1.24 For both the QMEAN Z-score and GMQE score, the higher numbers indicate the higher reliability
of the generated models. The sequence identities between the template
and the div-EF-1α considered in this study ranged from 40 to
70%, which were lower than those calculated from the solo-EF-1α
(70–80%). By comparing the QMEAN4 scores, it was shown that
the qualities of the generated models of the div-EF-1α were
found to be lower than those of the solo-EF-1α. Models e.g.,
with yeast EF-1α as the template, the QMEAN4 Z-scores ranged from −3.82 to −0.32 in the former, whereas
from −0.92 to −0.13 in the latter (Table S1). The sequence identities of EFL of both the dual-EF-containing
and EFL-containing species was lower than 45% and the estimated model
quality was also low accordingly (QMEAN4 was lower than −3.52).
The sequence identities between the solo- and div-EF-1α sequences
and the Aeropyrum sequence varied (Table S3), whereas those between the EFL sequences did not
vary significantly.

Using Aeropyrum pernix EF-1α as the template structure would be the most plausible
for the aa-tRNA binding form because the root-mean-square deviations
(RMSD) of Aeropyrum pernix EF-1α
(PDB ID: 3WXM) and the crystal structure (PDB ID: 1TTT)29 of EF-Tu
bound to Phe-tRNA was only 2.26 Å. There is no GTP-bound eukaryotic
EF-1α structure found for the template search and no X-ray crystal
structures of eukaryotic EF-1α and aa-tRNA complex has been
solved to this date. Assuming that eukaryotic EF-1α proteins
have structures similar to the archaeal or bacterial orthologues when
they interact with aa-tRNAs, the homology models using the Aeropyrum EF-1α as the template were employed to the
following molecular surface analyses and molecular docking simulations
to evaluate whether EF-1α/EFL bind to aa-tRNAs.

MD Simulations
For more detailed analysis of the structures
of EF-1α and EFL, we performed the MD simulations for some selected
models. Because many amino acid sequences in an N-terminal domain
are missing in many species, we limitedly selected two EF-1α
proteins of Pythium ultimum DAOM BR144
(dual-EF-containing species) and Subulatomonas sp.
strain PCMinv5 (EF-1α-containing species) and two EFL proteins
of Thecamonas trahens ATCC50062 (dual-EF-containing
species) and Fabomonas tropica strain
NYK3C (EFL-containing species) for the MD simulations. To generate
initial structures, we employed the MODELLER program30 using the three template structures.
The generated models contained all sequences including C-terminal
regions, which were not in the models obtained by SWISS-MODEL.

We confirmed the reliability of the predicted homology models
by comparing the MD simulations for EF-1α of the EF-1α-containing
species (Subulatomonas EF-1α) and the dual-EF-containing
species (Pythium div-EF-1α structure). Figure 1a,c,e, show the root-mean-square
deviations (RMSD) against each of the initial structure which was
obtained by homology modeling. Figure 1b,d,f show the radius of gyration (a measure of compactness
of the protein), which were almost stable over the simulation time.
Comparing the RMSD of the solo-EF-1α and div-EF-1α structures,
the latter was slightly more drifted than the former like those of
the other two EFLs. This negligible difference might have come from
the possible difference in the actual structures in vivo; the solo-EF-1α
would have the same structure as the given template; however, the
other three would not.

Figure 1 Root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) and gyrations of the
MD simulations
of proteins (a, b) with GDP (c, d) and with GTP (e, f) for EF-1α
of Subulatomonas sp. strain PCMinv5 (red line) and Pythium ultimum DAOM BR144 (purple line) and EFL
of Fabomonas tropica strain NYK3C (green
line) and Thecamonas trahens ATCC50062
(blue line).

Figure S6 shows the changes in the structures
and molecular surface after the MD simulations. The structures and
their molecular surfaces remained almost the same.

There was
some slight diversity in the dynamics; however, from
these short MD simulations, the predicted homology models were stable,
thus reliable. The four proteins shifted in RMSD for about 0.4 nm
and became stable within less than 10 ns (Figure 1). The RMSD of the solo-EF-1α structure
grew differently from those of other three structures. The EFL of Fabomonas also had slightly different dynamics in gyration.
The dynamical differences between predicted models and the instability
in their time evolution were both negligible. The atomic distances
for GTP-bound or GDP-bound models had slightly larger fluctuations;
however, they were still negligible. We might need a longer simulation
time to observe a dynamical change in their domain intervals (Figure 2).

distribution of the template and aa-tRNA
and EF-1α/EFL models, generated using the SWISS-MODEL using Aeropyrum EF-1α (PDB ID: 3WXM) as the template, obtained using the
eF-surf web server.31

To extract the essential dynamics and the dominant motions
in the
proteins, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using GROMACS. Root-mean-square fluctuations (RMSF) by the
first eigenvector are shown in Figure 3. The spectra had the peak at the residue number 231,
the boundary region between domains I and II/III. The boundary region
between II and III in the EFL models built on the template Aeropyrum EF-1α with GTP (Figure 3c,d: red) were more fluctuating than the
standard EF-1α (Figure 3a) and other proteins which were fluctuating uniformly along
the residues. RMSFs were also reflecting the dynamics that the GDP
forms of the EFL and the EF-1α in the dual-EF-containing were
more flexible among the domains I and II/III and the GTP forms of
EFLs were more flexible between domains II and III. The domain I of
EFL proteins where some sequences were added compared to EF-1α22 had less thermodynamic fluctuations than those
of EF-1α proteins. This might imply the thermodynamic stability
of EFL without GTP or GDP. Figure 4 shows the free energy landscapes (FEL) constructed
via PCA of the MD trajectories. The most stable structures of the
proteins were extracted from the lowest wells of the FEL and used
for the following analysis.

from blue (0 kcal mol–1) to red (15 kcal mol–1).

Judging from the structural
and dynamical properties analyzed here,
the MD simulations supported the homology models so that the surface
analysis was stable and reliable.

Surface Analyses
The molecular surfaces of the modeled
EF-1α and EFL proteins were analyzed using the eF-surf web server31 and compared to each other (see Figures 2 and S2–S4). The surface potentials are represented from anionic (red) to cationic
(blue) and the hydrophobic area is shown in yellow. Comparing the
EF-1α proteins of the single EF-1α-containing and dual-EF-containing
species, the latter (Figures S2–S4K–O,P–T) had more negative charges than the former
(Figures S2–S4A–J), which
would be unfavorable for interactions with negatively charged aa-tRNAs
during translation elongation, the canonical function of EF-1α.
On the other hand, the EFL proteins of both the dual-EF-containing
(Figures S2–S4U–X,Y–Z)
and the single EFL-containing species (Figures S2–S4A′–E′) seemed to have smaller
surface areas with negative charges than the div-EF-1α proteins
(Figures S2–S4K–O,P–T).
In particular, the aa-tRNA binding sites on EF-1α in the dual-EF-containing
species were negatively charged, whereas the EFL in the same species
were less negatively charged, and thus seemed to preserve the binding
sites.

The aa-tRNA binding sites of EF-1α were previously
inferred from the alignment of the yeast EF-1α and EF-Tu 10.7 The 31 sequences of EF-1α and EFL were
aligned by BLAST32 with the yeast EF-1α
sequence and then the aa-tRNA binding sites were marked as shown in Table S4. The eF-Surf calculates the electrostatic
potentials on the Connolly polygon vertices, so the neighboring polygon
vertices to the Cα atoms corresponding to the aligned binding
site residues were searched. The electrostatic potentials of the binding
sites or the sum of those at the vertices are shown in Table S5. “Neighborhood” values
were considered; the electrostatic potentials at the vertices within
5 nm spheres were summed up. The calculation also revealed that some
of the divergent EF-1α proteins of Pythium intermedium MAFF306022, Goniomonas sp. ATCC 50180, and Achnanthes kuwaitensis NIES1349 still preserved the
positively charged binding sites. Differential loss hypothesis assumes
that the div-EF-1α proteins have lost the canonical function
including aa-tRNA binding. Nevertheless, the three div-EF-1α
proteins might be capable of interacting with aa-tRNAs. Alternatively,
they have already stopped interacting with aa-tRNAs; however, the
surface electrostatic potentials have not been completely adapted
to the loss of the particular function and are still on the way to
lose the ability. A tiny swap in amino acid residues or the electron
configurations can make a huge difference in the electrostatic potentials,
consequently altering the function and the fate of the proteins.

All results of surface analysis support that in the dual-EF-containing
species div-EF-1α would not be involved in the translation elongation
and EFL might play the role instead as predicted from the sequence
diversity and the low expression level of div-EF-1α.19 In addition, comparing EF-1α and EFL,
it seemed that the EF-1β binding site33 was less hydrophobic in EFL (Figures S2–S4U–E′) than in EF-1α of the single EF-1α-containing
species (Figures S2–S4A–J).
The result suggests that EFL might not bind to EF-1β or other
proteins at this region, which is consistent with the previous study
indicating that EFL might be able to recharge GTP without EF-1β.22 Finally, we would like to mention that the both
solo- and div-EF-1α proteins and also EFL proteins seemed to
conserve the domains II and III, which were considered to be important
for its molecular switch or the moonlighting functions.

Docking Simulations
The docking simulations were performed
by employing the MEGADOCK 4.0.2 to consider
the interactions between EF-1α/EFL and Phe-tRNA. Figure 5a, Tables S6 and S7 reflect the predicted results of EF-1α/EFL–Phe-tRNA
interaction. Table S6 shows the E values representing the PPI scores of the predicted docking
of EF-1α/EFL and Phe-tRNA. EF-1α were generally high,
whereas those for the EFL were low in the affinity with Phe-tRNA (p-value = 1.2 × 10–4, p-value = 1.2 × 10–5) (Figure 5a). Also, the div-EF-1α were low in
the affinity (p-value = 0.02) (Figure 5a). This result was consistent with the hypothesis
that the div-EF-1α might not interact with aa-tRNA. The docking
simulations of EF-1α/EFL and EF-1β (PDB ID: 5O8W, chain B was used
for the docking target) revealed that EFL was somewhat less interacting
with EF-1β; however, there were no significant changes (p-value = 0.1) in the E values (Figure 1b). EFL could still
weakly interact with EF-1β. Table S6 shows the results of the EF-1α/EFL-tRNA interaction before
and after the MD simulations. For Subulatomonas EF-1α,
the model built with the yeast EF-1α increased the E values after the MD simulation, whereas for the models with the
rabbit EF-1α and Aeropyrum EF-1α, the
GDP-bound and the GTP-bound forms reduced the E values.
The other models were consistent with the fact that the GTP-bound
forms would be more likely to interact with aa-tRNA and the GDP-bound
and the normal forms do not. The decrease of the E value of the homology model of Subulatomonas EF-1α
with the EF-1α/GTP template of Aeropyrum or
the increase of the E values of the other models
with the template of Aeropyrum before and after the
MD simulation would not alter the results shown in Figure 5.

Conclusions
Homology
modeling and surface analysis of EF-1α and EFL were
performed to examine the hypothesis that divergent EF-1α in
the dual-EF-containing eukaryotes do not strongly interact with aa-tRNA
compared to the canonical EF-1α. The subsequent MD simulations
were carried out to confirm adequacy of the predicted structures and
investigate the difference in their dynamical behavior. The molecular
surfaces of the divergent ones were negatively charged, and thus they
might not interact with negatively charged aa-tRNA. The molecular
docking simulations also support this hypothesis.

Computational
Details
Homology Modeling
There are no crystal structures available
for any div-EF-1α of the target species or EFL, so their three-dimensional
structures were generated using standard protein homology modeling
methods. A total of 31 protein sequences were obtained from the literature,19 UniProt and GenBank databases.34 Structural homology models of EF-1α and EFL were
generated using the SWISS-MODEL24 with
three different X-ray crystal structures as the structural templates.
Multiple templates were used to avoid the template structure dependence,
as well as to consider the conformational change of EF-1α between
the active and inactive forms.35 (i) Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker’s yeast) eEF1A
(EF-1α) in complex with the eEF1Bα subunit of eEF1B (EF-1β)
and guanosine-5′-monophosphate (PDB ID: 1G7C(23)), (ii) post-translationally modified Oryctolagus
cuniculus (rabbit) isoform 2 of eEF1α (eEF1α2)
in complex with guanosine-5′-diphosphate and a Mg2+ ion crystallized as a dimer (PDB ID: 4C0S, chain A was used as the template),25 and (iii) a crenarchaeon Aeropyrum
pernix EF-1α in complex with archaeal Pelota,
guanosine-5′-triphosphate, and a Mg2+ ion (PDB ID: 3WXM, chain A was used
as the template)26 were chosen to consider
the EF-1β binding form, the GDP-bound inactive form, and the
GTP-bound active form, respectively.

The average form of EF-1α
contains 462 amino acid residues, composed of three domains, that
is, domain I (residues from 10 to 240), domain II (residues from 241
to 336), and domain III (residues from 337 to 435).36 Regarding the structural differences of the selected templates,
the GDP-bound form, which is represented by rabbit EF-1α, is
an open form where the distances between domain I and domain II/domain
III are distant, whereas the GTP-bound form, which is represented
by Aeropyrum EF-1α, domain I rotates by 90°
relative to domains II and III and has narrow and closed domain intervals.
The cleft created between domains I, II, and III in the GTP-bound
form is the binding site for aa-tRNAs and EF-1β.33 Domain I contains the GTP hydrolysis site.37 The comparison of the templates is shown in Figure S1.

Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations of the selected homology models were carried out to investigate
the thermodynamic stability of the modeled structures and to examine
the interactions between GDP or GTP and the EF-1α or EFL proteins
affecting the structures. MD simulations were performed for EF-1α
proteins of Pythium ultimum DAOM BR144
(dual-EF-containing species), Subulatomonas sp. strain
PCMinv5 (EF-1α-containing species) and EFL proteins of Thecamonas trahens ATCC50062 (dual-EF-containing
species) and Fabomonas tropica strain
NYK3C (EFL-containing species). The four representatives were chosen
for their good quality of data containing the whole sequences. The
initial structures were obtained using homology modeling by the MODELLER program30 using
yeast EF-1α, rabbit EF-1α, and Aeropyrum EF-1α. We aligned the target sequences with each of the three
template sequences by Clustal Omega.(38) The MODELLER program
was employed to complete the full sequences including the C-terminal
regions which were missing in the models generated using the SWISS-MODEL.

The GROMACS 5.0.4 program39 was adopted for the MD simulations.
Long-range electrostatic interactions were treated with the fast smooth
particle-mesh Ewald method,40 and the cut-offs
for van der Waals and Coulomb interactions were set to 10 Å.
The time-step was 2 fs with P-LINCS algorithms41 for constraining the bond lengths. Proteins were parameterized
using the AMBER99SB-ILDN(42) force field. The atomic charges for GTP and GDP were determined
with the restrained electrostatic potential method using Gaussian
0943 at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory
and the force field parameters were taken from the general Amber force
field44 using the Antechamber program,45 and the generated topology files were converted
using the ACPYPE program.46 The models
were placed on dodecahedron boxes of the TIP3P47 water model with distances of at least 10 Å from the
box edge and neutralized by adding Cl– or Na+ counter ions. First, energy minimization was carried out
to relax the structure. Then, we performed short MD simulations for
equilibration for 100 ps in the NVT ensemble, followed by another
100 ps at 1.0 bar in the NPT ensemble with applying a position restraining
force on the heavy atoms of the protein and ligands, and production
run for 100 ns at 300 K. An averaged structure located at the center
of the largest cluster was chosen to analyze the molecular surface
using the eF-surf web server.31

Quantitative
characterization of the conformational dynamics of
each system was performed using principal component analysis (PCA).
We applied g_covar and g_anaeig utilities of the GROMACS package to attain
the covariance matrix of the RMSD of the protein backbone (Cα
atoms) and its diagonalisation, yielding a set of eigenvectors and
corresponding eigenvalues. Some of the former provide principal axes
of the large-amplitude concerted motions characterizing the essential
subspace of each protein’s internal dynamics, whereas the latter
represents the amplitude of the motion along the eigenvector. The
projection of the trajectories on each principal axis shows the width
of the essential space explored by the system as a function of time.
A comparison of the conformational space sampled by different trajectories
generated for the same system can be made to gain insight into the
amount of essential space explored by the system during the MD simulation.

Surface Analyses
It is useful to investigate the molecular
surface to understand the function of proteins, because specific intermolecular
interactions such as electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions are
important in molecular recognition.48−50 Molecular surfaces of
almost all protein structures registered in PDB are available in eF-site
database,51 which calculates the polygon-meshed
molecular surfaces by the MSP program developed by Connolly,52 then the electrostatic potentials were calculated
by solving the Poisson–Boltzmann equations using the SCB program.53 The molecular surfaces and electrostatic potentials
for the template proteins were obtained from the eF-site database,51 whereas those of the models were calculated
using the eF-surf web server,31 which calculates
the molecular surface for the up-loaded structures in the same way
as the eF-site database.

Docking Simulations
Molecular docking
simulations were
carried out to examine interactions54 between
EF-1α and phenylalanyl-tRNA (Phe-tRNA). MEGADOCK
ver. 4.0.2(55) was employed to
perform the docking simulations. We adopted the default parameter
values for all calculations. For the docking score functions, the
real Pairwise Shape Complementarity score,55 electrostatics score based on FTDock potentials56 and CHARMM19 atomic charge,57,58 RDE desolvation
free energy59 were referred. On the basis
of the docking scores of 2000 predicted models, the evaluation value E(60) or the protein–protein
interaction (PPI) score was then calculated to judge whether each
EF-1α/EFL (protein) and Phe-tRNA (ligand) can interact or not.
The evaluation value E or the standardized variable
was obtained by subtracting the mean from the top-scored decoy’s
docking score for a protein–ligand pair and then dividing by
the standard deviation.
