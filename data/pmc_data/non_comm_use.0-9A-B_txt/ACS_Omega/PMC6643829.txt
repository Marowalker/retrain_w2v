Exposure of a protein to cosolutes,
like denaturants, changes its
folding equilibrium. To determine the ensemble of protein conformations
at equilibrium, in the presence of weakly interacting cosolutes, we
present a two-stage analysis of solution X-ray scattering data. In
the first stage, Guinier analysis and Kratky plot revealed information
about the compactness and flexibility of the protein. In the second
stage, elastic network contact model and coarse-grained normal mode
analysis were used to generate an ensemble of conformations. The scattering
curves of the conformations were computed and fitted to the measured
scattering curves to get insights into the dominating folding states
at equilibrium. Urea and guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) behaved as
preferentially included weakly interacting cosolutes and induced denaturation
of hen egg-white lysozyme, which served as our test case. The computed
models adequately fit the data and gave ensembles of conformations
that were consistent with our measurements. The analysis suggests
that in the presence of urea, lysozyme retained its compactness and
assumed molten globule characteristics, whereas in the presence of
GuHCl lysozyme adopted random coiled conformations. Interestingly,
no equilibrium intermediate states were observed in both urea and
GuHCl.

1 Introduction
Protein
folding has been studied for over half a century and is
still considered an unresolved problem.1,2 Unclear aspects
of this problem include the stability of proteins in the presence
of denaturing cosolutes. Environmental conditions determine if a protein
remains in its stable and compact folded state or explores the energy
landscape with a more structurally diverse ensemble of unfolded and
partly unfolded states.2

The folded
or native state of a globular protein is defined as
the small ensemble of compact conformations in which the protein is
stable and performs its action. The folded state is in dynamic equilibrium
with unfolded states, comprising of a large ensemble of iso-energetic,
disordered, and extended conformations, which have higher entropy,
but are energetically unfavored. Exposure to extreme conditions, including
low or high temperatures, high pressure, or the presence of cosolutes,
might perturb the compact protein structure, cause denaturation, and
shift the equilibrium toward unfolded states.3

At equilibrium, the balance between the folded and unfolded
states
is set by the protein energy landscape. The free-energy landscape
is typically modeled as a funnel shape, where the folded state is
located at the bottom of the funnel, at the global free energy minimum
conformation, whereas unfolded states, having higher free energies,
are located at the top of the funnel.4 According
to this theory, protein folds by taking thermodynamically driven steps
that are mostly incrementally downhill toward the free energy minimum.
As the folded state is only 5–10 kcal/mol more stable than
the unfolded state, even a small disruption of intermolecular interactions
may shift the folding equilibrium.4,5

The ensemble
of conformations of intrinsically disordered proteins
or dynamic biomolecules with disordered segments were determined by
combining solution X-ray scattering experiments with several computational
methods. Ensemble optimization method, basis-set supported small-angle
X-ray scattering (SAXS) reconstruction, or molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations with minimal ensemble search approach are examples of
methods that were used.6−15

In this paper, we studied the effect of the weakly interacting
denaturant cosolutes, urea, and GuHCl, on the structure of hen egg-white
lysozyme, using modern synchrotron X-ray scattering and advanced analysis
tools. The dominating folding states at equilibrium, under various
concentrations of denaturants, were structurally examined.

Lysozyme
is a monomeric, globular, and antimicrobial enzyme protein,
abundant in tears, saliva, and human milk.16 Lysozyme has 129 amino acid residues and its molecular weight is
14 300 Da. The compact globule structure is stabilized by four disulfide
bonds and two domains: an α-domain that contains several α-helices
and a β-domain comprised largely of β-stands.17 Lysozyme serves as a model protein for investigating
protein stability, folding,18 denaturation,19−21 and aggregation.22 Lysozyme was selected
owing to its stability and that it has no significantly populated
equilibrium intermediate states in urea- and GuHCl-induced unfolding,
making it a good example of a protein that fits the two-state unfolding
mechanism of protein under several denaturing conditions.18,19,23,24 This feature is attributed to the tight packing at the interface
between the two domains, allowing them to operate as a single cooperative
unit.20

Urea and GuHCl are widely-known
as protein denaturants that shift
the dynamic equilibrium in favor of unfolded states above a critical
concentration. It is believed that the contribution of urea and GuHCl
to protein denaturation is enthalpic (in other words, involves specific
cosolute/protein hydrophobic, van der Waals, or polar interactions)
and is associated with weakening of the hydrophobic effect.3 By doing so, the denaturants solvate nonpolar
surfaces, induce swelling of the amino acid chain, and stabilize hydrophobically
confined liquid phase against dewetting.25 Despite the vast amount of research done on urea and GuHCl, the
mechanism governing their activity has remained elusive,3 owing to the weak interactions that are involved
in the process and because molar concentrations are required to destabilize
proteins.26 It is unclear, for example,
whether the interactions of the cosolute are directly with the protein
or indirectly through modification of the solvent properties.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Chemicals
Lyophilized
powder of hen
egg-white lysozyme (purity ≥ 90%), urea (≥99.0%), guanidine
hydrochloride (≥99%), sucrose (≥99.5%), and glycine
(≥99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. For the buffer preparation
(50 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5), we used sodium acetate trihydrate
(≥99.0%) and glacial acetic acid (≥99.85%) that were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All chemicals were used without further
purification.

The following analysis is suitable for nonaggregating
proteins. Because lysozyme aggregates from 4 M GuHCl,22 we chose to work with lower concentrations of GuHCl.

2.2 Solution SAXS
Measurements of 2.5
mg/mL lysozyme were performed in P12 beamline of the EMBL located
at the PETRA III storage ring (DESY, Hamburg).27 Measurements of 5 and 50 mg/mL lysozyme were performed
in SWING beamline at Soleil Synchrotron (GIF-sur-YVETTE).28 Measurements were performed at 20 °C. Two-dimensional
scattering patterns were azimuthally integrated29 and gave the 1D scattering intensity, I (cm–1), as a function of the magnitude of the
scattering vector, q (nm–1). Under
similar solution conditions, the scattering curves, normalized by
sample concentration, of low and high concentration of lysozyme overlapped
from q > 1 nm–1 (Figure S1). At the high concentrations of lysozyme,
the signal-to-noise
ratio was high; however, at the low q-range (q < 1 nm–1) the interaction between
the protein contributed to structure factor, which was not observed
at the low concentration. We therefore merged the curves and used
the curve of 2.5 mg/mL lysozyme for q ≤ 1
nm–1 and the curves of 50 mg/mL lysozyme for q > 1 nm–1.

2.3 Elastic
Network Contact Model
We
generated different conformations of lysozyme using elastic network
contact model (ENCoM),30 a coarse-grained
normal mode analysis method for exploring protein conformational space.30 The protein data bank (PDB) ID used as the initial
structure for conformational sampling was 1LYZ, a structure that was obtained by X-ray
diffraction at 2 Å resolution.17 We
generated an ensemble that contained three sets of conformations with
different ranges of root-mean-square-deviation of atomic positions
(rmsd) values, with respect to the crystal structure. The ranges were
0–2, 3–10, and 8–17 Å, corresponding to
folded, partially folded, and unfolded conformations, respectively.
The number of conformations was the maximum ENCoM can generate, using
its default parameters 257 folded, 340 partially folded, and 340 unfolded
conformations. We used the default parameters (the number of modes
was 3, the start mode was 7, and the rmsd distortion per conformation
was 0.5 Å) and adjusted the maximum rmsd distortion as needed.

2.4 Computing the Scattering Curves of Atomic
Models
The scattering intensity depends on the contrast between
the electron density of the solute atomic model and the solvent. Following
the addition of chemical denaturants in molar concentrations, we had
to correct the bulk electron density of the solvent (see Table S1). We computed the expected scattering
curve from each atomic model, using CRYSOL.31 The maximum order of harmonics was 50, and the order of Fibonacci
grid was 18. A 3 Å thick hydration layer with an electron density
contrast of 30 e–/nm3 with respect to
the bulk was added to each atomic structure. K-means clustering algorithm
was applied and the scattering curve of the centroid of each cluster
was calculated by wide angle X-ray scattering in solvent (WAXSiS),
an automated web server, which runs a short explicit-solvent MD simulation
using YASARA.32,33 WAXSiS produces a more accurate
model of the solvation shell (compared with CRYSOL31) surrounding the protein. In WAXSiS, the default envelop
distance (7 Å) and normal convergence were used.

2.5 Cluster Analysis
Clustering was performed
by K-means clustering method over the log(I) versus q plots of the scattering curves calculated by CRYSOL. The
logarithmic intensity scale allowed us to cluster according to the
entire q-range. Otherwise, the large differences
in intensity along the entire q-range would cause
the clustering process to be according to the low q-range only. For each cluster, the model with the logarithmic scattering
curve with the lowest squared Euclidean distance to the centroid was
chosen to be the representative model for that cluster. Clustering
was performed for each set of scattering curves with the same solvent
electron density, using 1000 repetitions.

2.6 Fitting
Fitting of log(I) versus q plots
was performed using least-squares
minimization of the sum of residual blocks of the scattering curves
and the models calculated by WAXSiS, at each q  where Icalc(q) = B + A∑i=1NxiIi(q).

x⃗ is the
weight vector, I(q) is the measured
scattering curve, Ii(q) is the scattering
curve of the i-th centroid conformation, and xi is the molar fraction of
the i-th conformation. B is a background
constant and A is a scale factor that was added to
improve the fit. The maximum number of iterations was set to 1010, the tolerance step size was set to 10–10, and the function tolerance was set to 10–10.
FMINCON algorithm was used to solve the nonlinear optimization problem.34

To estimate the error in the probability
distribution, Icalc(q) was fitted to 50% of
the data points, which were randomly selected. The errors did not
change when 80% of the data points were taken into account. For each
sample, the fit was repeated 5 times and the error was estimated from
the standard deviations of the resulting distributions. The reported
distribution is based on fitting to the entire data.

Figure S2 shows that when only 30% of
data points were randomly selected, the resulting population of the
native state, in some of the fits, contained a higher fraction of
unfolded conformations than physically expected. Hence, more than
30% of the data points (217 points) were required to obtain reproducible
physically meaningful results, based on which error in the probability
distribution could be estimated. The required number of data points
is an order of magnitude higher compared with the number of Shannon
channels in the data. Figure S3 shows that
analysis of the same native state scattering data by randomly selecting
a single point from each Shannon channel and repeating the process
a hundred times35 resulted in a relatively
high fraction (more than 20%) of broadly distributed unfolded conformations.
This value is significantly higher than physically expected; hence,
this analysis approach was not adopted.

The alternative analysis
approaches presented in Figures S2 and S3 led to broad distributions. The analysis
with all the scattering data point imposed more constraints and hence
could be biased toward narrow distributions.

Changing the cost
function from log(I(q)) to I(q) was tested
and found to be adequate only at the low q-range
owing to the high intensity in that part of the scattering curves.
Fitting using least squares that are weighted by the measurement error
of I versus q plots was also tested
and found to be adequate only at the high q-range,
owing to the low error values in that part of the curves.

2.7 VADAR
Structural information about
the atomic models was gained using volume, area, dihedral angle reporter
(VADAR), a web server for quantitative protein structure evaluation
from their coordinates.36,37 Accessible surface
area (ASA) was calculated using Shrake & Rupley algorithm.38

3 Results and Discussion
Initially, low-resolution Guinier
analysis and Kratky plots were
used to investigate the compactness and flexibility of the protein
(Figure S4). Guinier analysis reveals the
radius of gyration of a protein from SAXS measurements. The radius
of gyration, Rg, is a strong indicator
of the level of structure compactness. Rg is defined as the root-mean square of the distances of all electrons
from the center of mass. Rg can be obtained
from SAXS measurements, using the Guinier approximation, which states
that for q·Rg ≤
1.3, the scattering curve of a spherical particle (a folded protein
in our case) can be approximated by a Gaussian curve. A plot of ln[I(q)] versus q2 reveals the value of Rg from the slope 1  

In the case of unfolded proteins, the q-range
at which the Guinier approximation is valid is more limited than the
range of folded proteins. The reason is that the extension of the
protein’s conformation makes the higher order terms in the
expansion, from which the Guinier approximation is derived, significant.
On the basis of observations of Borgia et al., we chose to restrict
the q-range to , which
was found to be consistent with
results from other computational and experimental techniques.40Figure S5 shows that
if , is used, when no cosolutes
are added,
the fitted gyration radius was 1.41 ± 0.10 nm.

Because
the value of qmax is determined
by the Rg itself, the process of determining
the Rg from the Guinier plot was done
iteratively until a constant value was achieved. The minimum q-value for Guinier plots was determined according to the
quality of data at the very low-q region.

Figure 1 shows the
effect of added denaturants on Rg. The Rg of lysozyme increased with the concentration
of GuHCl, indicating a gradual swelling of the protein. In contrast,
with urea, there was nearly no change in the Rg values, even in 8 M urea solution. The Guinier plots are
presented in Figures S4–S6.

Figure 1 Radius of gyration, Rg, of lysozyme
as a function of denaturant concentration. Rg values were obtained from Guinier analysis (Figures S4 and S6).

We then used Kratky plot, which is a plot of I(q)·q2 versus q, to gain insights into the globularity and flexibility
of the measured protein.27 The plot of
a well-folded globular protein is expected to show a Gaussian-like
shape with a well-defined maximum at small q and
a horizontal asymptotic behavior at high q. In the
case of a protein with random coil structure, the plot is far from
the Gaussian-like shape, exhibiting a plateau over a specific range
of q, which is followed by a monotonic increase.
The folded states of most proteins lie between these two extremes,
exhibiting some deviations from Gaussian characteristics, depending
on the flexibility of the protein. In addition, the position of the
“bell-shape” peak is generally indicative of intermolecular
interactions. A shift in the peak position toward the low q-range might suggest enhancement of the intramolecular
interactions.

Figure 2 depicts
the normalized Kratky plots of lysozyme samples at different urea
and GuHCl concentrations. Although Kratky plots of globular proteins
decay to zero at high q, all the plots in Figure 2 diverged, signifying
that the lysozyme was flexible, even in the buffer solution. This
flexibility can be attributed to the dynamics associated with the
two domains of the protein that is highly important for the enzymatic
function of lysozyme.

Figure 2 Normalized Krakty plots of lysozyme in different urea
and GuHCl
concentrations as indicated in the figure. The plots were normalized
to have the same peak intensity.

In all the urea solutions, lysozyme retained its Gaussian-like
shape at the low q-range and exhibited a well-defined
maximum that did not shift significantly with urea concentration.
At the high q-range, however, the deviation from
the Gaussian-like shape increased with urea concentration. GuHCl had
a similar effect at the high q-range, but the maximum
of the Gaussian-like shape shifted toward higher q values with increasing GuHCl concentrations.

Overall, the
Kratky and Guiner analyses suggested that increasing
GuHCl concentration shifted the equilibrium from compact to extended
folding confirmations. The analyses suggest that urea did cause conformational
changes, but lysozyme retained its compactness.

The influence
of both denaturants was studied using bioactivity
measurements, microcalorimetry, and Raman spectroscopy.41 The results showed that the bioactivity of lysozyme
in 8 M urea solutions decreased by up to 15%. The effect was attributed
to changes in the tertiary structure without noticeable effects on
the secondary structure, suggesting that in the presence of urea,
lysozyme assumes molten globule characteristics. In the presence of
GuHCl, however, the loss of bioactivity was 40% and both the tertiary
and secondary structures changed, leading to a random coil conformation.
A study about the dynamic surface properties of lysozyme solutions
in the presence of urea and GuHCl supported these claims.21

In the second stage, a model-based analysis
of the solution X-ray
scattering measurements was performed. We fitted the calculated scattering
curves of the conformational ensemble to the measured curve to get
insights into the influence of the denaturants on the folding equilibrium.

Previous studies18,19,23 indicated that there are no equilibrium intermediate states in urea-
and GuHCl-induced denaturation of hen egg-white lysozyme, for the
ranges of denaturant concentrations and pH values used in our study.
At pH of 2.9, however, intermediate states were reported.42 Hence, to perform model-based analysis of the
solution X-ray scattering data, we created an ensemble of conformations
comprising two sets with rmsd values (computed with respect to the
crystal structure) ranging between 0 and 2 Å and between 8 and
17 Å, corresponding to folded and unfolded conformations, respectively
(see Materials and Methods).

The scattering
curves of the conformations were computed by CRYSOL
and then clustered by K-means algorithm.43 The centroid of each curve was computed by WAXSiS, which uses MD
simulations to account for the hydration layer. To determine the optimal
number of clusters, which gives a good fit to the scattering data,
the R2 values of the fitting of the WAXSiS
calculated scattering curves to the native buffer solution were compared
for different numbers of clusters (Figure S7). The comparison indicates that even at 30 clusters the fitting
is adequate. We chose to work with 50 clusters because there was no
significant improvement in the R2 value
of the fit with a larger number of clusters.

We added to the
ensemble another set of conformations with rmsd
that ranged between 2 and 10 Å, which corresponds to folding
intermediates. The entire conformational ensemble, with rmsd range
of 0–17 Å, was clustered again to 50 clusters. Figure S8 presents the fitting of calculated
scattering curves of conformational ensemble to the measured 8 M urea
and 3 M GuHCl. In both denaturants, models with rmsd between 2 and
12 Å were not selected. These results are consistent with a two-state
unfolding mechanism, leading to an equilibrium between folded (rmsd
of 0–2 Å) and unfolded (rmsd above 12 Å) states,
with a negligible fraction of intermediates. Figure S9 shows that when the ensemble of computed conformations contained
only the unfolded states, the quality of the fit in the native state
at the high q-range (q > 3 nm–1) was rather poor, compared with that in Figure 3. The quality of
the fit improved with increasing the concentration of cosolutes, which
promoted denaturation.

Figure 3 Background subtracted scattering intensity curve of lysozyme
in
50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH = 4.5), and in the same buffer with
3 M GuHCl, or 8 M urea (black curves), as indicated. The red curves
are the best-fitted models, based on the computed ensemble of lysozyme
conformations (see text). The insets show the fraction of conformations
as a function of their rmsd values (with respect to the crystal structure).

The scattering curves of each
lysozyme conformation in the ensemble
were computed. Similar curves were clustered. The centroid curves
computed by WAXSiS were then fitted to the experimental scattering
curves of 2.5 mg/mL lysozyme in 50 mM sodium acetate (pH = 4.5). Figure 3 shows the data and
the result of the best fit to the data. The fits to the rest of the
samples are shown in Figure S10. Ribbon
diagram of the selected (centroid) models are presented in Figures S11–S17. In all the samples, the
scattering curve of the weighted ensemble adequately fitted the entire q-range. The R2 values for all
the samples were 0.994 or higher.

The fraction of folded conformations
decreased as the denaturant
concentration increased (insets of Figures 3 and S10). This
result indicates a gradual shift in the folding equilibrium toward
the unfolded state. These findings are supported by the weighted average
rmsd values, from the crystal structure of lysozyme, as a function
of denaturant concentration (Figure 4). The rmsd gradually grew with the denaturant concentration,
with a steeper slope for GuHCl solutions compared with urea solutions,
indicating that GuHCl is a stronger denaturant. Figure 1, however, shows that, within the error,
the value of Rg did not change with urea
concentration, suggesting that the average protein level of compactness
remained unchanged but the conformations significantly deviated from
the native tertiary structure.

Figure 4 Weighted average root-mean-square deviation
(rmsd), with respect
to the crystal structure of lysozyme (PDB ID 1LYZ), of the models
that were selected to fit the data in Figures 3 and S10, as a function of denaturant concentration.

Gradual growth as a function of
concentration was also observed
in the ASA of lysozyme, as a function of denaturant concentration
(Figure 5). Although
the change in ASA is within the range of error for both denaturants,
the ASA gradient of urea is significantly lower than that of GuHCl.
The ASA of a protein can reveal much about its compactness and its
conformational changes. The ASA is a geometric measure of the exposure
of the protein to the surrounding environment; hence, the interfacial
free energy depends on its value.44 Few
studies have regarded the relation between the two as strictly linear.45,46 Urea caused relatively minor changes to the solvent accessible area
of lysozyme compared to GuHCl. These results support the claim that
lysozyme retained its globular structure in the presence of urea but
adopted random coil conformations in the presence of GuHCl.

Figure 5 Weighted average
ASA, of the models that were selected to fit the
data in Figures 3 and
S10, as function of denaturant concentration.

The thermodynamics of denaturant-induced conformational changes
is often described by the Wyman linkage (or Gibbs adsorption isotherm).47−50 Consider a system comprised of an extended interface, in our case,
an unfolded protein, surrounded by solvent containing a denaturant.
Because there is a favorable interaction between the denaturant and
the interface (in other words, the denaturant is preferentially included),
the interfacial free energy is lowered compared with the interfacial
free energy in the pure solvent.51 Thus,
the interface is stabilized. Our result suggest the gradual growth
of ASA with concentration and the gradual decrease, although minor
in urea samples, in the weighted average of the number of residues
that are 95% buried, with concentration (Figure S18). These data indicate that urea and GuHCl preferentially
interact with lysozyme and stabilize the unfolded state by virtue
of their preferential inclusion. MD simulations by England et al.
support this claim by showing the impact of denaturants on dewetting
of hydrophobic plates immersed in water and urea or GuHCl solutions.25 Both denaturants stabilized the liquid phase
against dewetting, and thereby weakened the attraction between hydrophobic
surfaces. Taken together, urea and GuHCl stabilized the unfolded state
by favoring expanded polypeptide conformations.

Finally, the
weighted average number of residues forming hydrogen
bonds within the protein (main-chain and side-chain) decreased with
denaturant concentration (Figure 6). GuHCl had a stronger effect compared with urea.
These phenomena can be attributed to the loss of the secondary structure
owing to denaturation, with urea causing minor changes in the secondary
structure compared with GuHCl.

hydrogen bonds within
lysozyme (main-chain and side-chain) of the models that were selected
to fit the data in Figures 3 and S10, as a function of denaturant concentrations.

4 Conclusions
In this
study, we used solution X-ray scattering to investigate
the folding equilibrium of egg-white lysozyme in the presence of the
denaturating cosolutes urea and GuHCl. Our analysis provided insights
into the dominating folding states at equilibrium in solution. The
change upon denaturation was quantitatively estimated by several parameters
like the weighted average of ASA and the rmsd from the crystal structure
of the lysozyme.

Our results supported the hypothesis that urea
caused lysozyme
to gradually assume a structure with molten globule characteristics,
while GuHCl caused lysozyme to assume a random coil structure. Equilibrium
intermediate states were hardly detected.

In the case of urea,
the errors of the weighted average of the
structural parameters according to the fit were larger than the change
in their values. However, the change as a function of urea concentration
was still noticeable. Our data were fairly sensitive to major changes
in the secondary structure. Higher q-range, better
signal-to-noise ratio, and advanced molecular simulations of protein-denaturant
interactions might make the presented analysis applicable to a broader
set of structures.
