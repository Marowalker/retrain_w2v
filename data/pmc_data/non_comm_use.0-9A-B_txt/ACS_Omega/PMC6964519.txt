A useful oxidation of C–H bond of benzylic acetals
has been
achieved. This method avoids the use of stoichiometric metals and
is compatible with the presence of both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing
substituents on the aromatic ring. Oxidation was carried out by rapid
microwave irradiation of benzylic acetals with PhI(OAc)2 as the oxidant. This led to the oxidation of acetals into 2-acetoxy-1,3-dioxolanes.
Furthermore, this transformation protocol encompasses a wide range
of valuable conversions of these useful synthons into different carboxylic
acid derivatives.

Introduction
Synthetic method chemistry has undergone
intense development during
the past 50 years. Among the methodologies that have been developed
in the past few years, C–H activation/functionalization remains
the most sought after.1,2 The oxidative functionalization
of inherently less-reactive benzylic C–H bond to generate C–C
and C–X (X = heteroatom) bonds has been of particular interest.
It is a convenient transformation of alkyl arenes into the corresponding
carbonyl compounds.3 The vast majority
of these transformations relied heavily on transition-metal catalysts.4a,4b Particularly, in the past decade, transition metal-catalyzed oxidative
esterification of aldehydes with alcohols, boronic acids, and aryl
halides has provided a convenient alternative approach to C–H
functionalization of aldehydes (Scheme 1, path a–d).4d However,
stoichiometric amounts of metal salt as an oxidant and complicated
ligand and excess Lewis acid or base as additives are required, which
make these transformations environmentally unfriendly.

Scheme 1 Different
Previous Approaches for the Synthesis of Esters from Aldehydes
To avoid expensive TM catalysts and the challenges
involved in
the removal of toxic metal residues from the desired products, metal-free
oxidation reactions have attracted prominent attention.5 Among metal-free C–H activations, umpolung
reactions6 of aldehydes by using NHC7 or other nucleophilic catalysis are very common.
Notably, in 2011, Wan group demonstrated a metal-free aldehyde C–H
oxidation to peresters with tert-butyl hydroperoxide
(Scheme 1, path d).8a Despite a few examples, there remains a strong
demand for the further development of new metal-free aldehyde C–H
activations. Therefore, the development of mild and eco-friendly C–H
functionalization would be highly desirable. On the other hand, we
are intrigued by reports from several groups that the hypervalent
iodine compounds have been effective oxidation reagents.8b In particular, aryl-iodanes (iodine in I3+) have been established as cheap and nontoxic alternatives
to transition metals in oxidative C–H bond activations.9 Moreover, PhI(OAc)2 has been used
as an oxidant for C–H functionalization along with catalytic
palladium.10a−10d Also, more recently, interesting examples of utilizing hypervalent
iodine oxidants for the direct oxidation of benzylic C–H bonds
involving radical mechanism were reported.11

With this in mind, herein, we disclosed oxidation of benzylic
acetals
by using hypervalent iodine oxidant PhI(OAc)2. We have
initiated the work with the synthesis of benzylic acetals by the reported
method.12,13 Next, we focused on the C–H oxidation
of benzylic acetals. Oxidation proceeds rapidly under microwave irradiation
to form 2-acetoxy-1,3-dioxolanes.

Results and Discussion
The present study was initiated
from 2a as a starting
substrate, and PhI(OAc)2 was selected as an oxidant for
its ability in radical-mediated C–H oxidation in previous reports.11,14 Different solvents have been tested to find the best reaction medium
(Table 1). To our delight,
1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) was found to be the optimal solvent for the
targeted benzylic oxidation, and acetoxylation of the acetal C–H
was achieved under heating condition (Table 1). The poor yield obtained in entry 8 designated
that the oxidant concentration was not sufficient. On the other hand,
increasing oxidant loading from 1 to 3 equiv improved the yield (Table 1, entry 8–9).
After all these trials, entry 10 was found to be the more suitable
condition in the conventional heating method. Next, an accelerating
effect of the microwave irradiation has been applied (Table 1, entry 13–16) which
was more effective than the conventional thermal heating method. Subsequently,
the yields obtained were comparatively higher, and the reaction was
rapid. Finally, it is found that the reaction conditions of entry
13 appeared to be the optimum condition.

out by the microwave irradiation method.

Having the optimized condition in hand, we next explored
the generality
of this microwave-promoted direct acetoxylation of benzylic C–Hs
of aromatic acetals. As shown in Table 2, a variety of benzylic acetals were investigated under
the optimal conditions. Substrates with the electron-withdrawing nitro
group at para, ortho, and meta positions were found to be compatible
and gave corresponding 3b, 3h, and 3k in 84–69% yield, respectively. Products with bromo
or chloro substitution in the cases of 3c, 3d, 3g, 3j, and 3l were obtained
in 67–56%. Also, as for electron-donating methyl and alkoxy
groups, the acetoxylated products were isolated in 85–55% yield
(3e, 3i and 3m). To our delight,
benzylic acetals containing multiple substituents were also converted
efficiently to the desired acetoxy dioxolanes products 3n–3p in moderated yields. Notably, formation of dioxolane 3r in 77% yield demonstrated that the polycyclic aromatic acetals can
work in these conditions. The heterocyclic benzylic acetal 2s was also amenable in the above reaction conditions. Finally, a cinnamaldehyde
substrate was utilized to prepare a dioxolane 3t in a
52% yield, showing that acetal with conjugation to the aromatic ring
is also compatible. On the other hand, we observed that the efficiency
of this reaction rather limited to the use of aromatic acetals, as
aliphatic compound 2u and vinylic 2v were
found inactive in this condition. In contrast to the abovementioned
examples with 5-membered ring acetal, 6-membered ring acetal 2w and thioacetal 2x were found to be not compatible
in this oxidation.

Based on the nature of active benzylic C–H
bonds of our
substrates and similarity in oxidant reactivity reported in literature,14,15 we suspected the participation of radical intermediates in the presenting
C–H oxidation. When the control experiments were conducted
between 2a and DAIB in the presence of a radical trap,
2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl, the desired product 3a was totally suppressed, demonstrating that a radical process was
involved in this reaction system. Furthermore, we carried out the
KIE study with 2a and [D1]2a as the substrates and observed a ratio of KH/KD at 3.5, supporting
our speculation of H-abstraction during key-step of the transformation
(Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Mechanic
Experiments (i) and (ii)
With these results in hand, we propose a reaction
mechanism as
depicted in Scheme 3. As it was reported in literature15a the
DAIB under microwave irradiation undergoes homolytic cleavage to form
an acetoxy radical 7 along with iodanyl radical 8. The iodanyl radical would abstract the hydrogen atom from
benzaldehyde acetal 2a to produce actal radical 9. The acetoxy radical 7, which then react with
acetal radical 9, produced 2-acetoxylated-1,3-dioxolane 3a (path A). On the other hand, the iodine(III) intermediate 10 can be further cleaved into iodobenzene and methyl formate.
Another possible course of the reaction mechanism assumes the formation
of benzyl cation 11, resulting from single electron transfer
oxidation11a of benzyl radical 9, most probably by acetoxy radical 7 (path B).

Scheme 3 Proposed
Mechanism for the Oxidation of Benzaldehyde Acetal 2a
To further expand the synthetic utility of this
direct C–H
oxidation methodology, we anticipated that acetoxy-1,3-dioxolanes
could be used as useful building blocks in organic synthesis, serving
as counterparts for esters. As shown in the following scheme, 2-acetoxy-1,3-dioxolane
compounds (3a–x) were demonstrated as synthons
for the synthesis of carboxylic acid derivatives (Scheme 4). Basic aqueous hydrolyzed
the compounds 3k, 3p, and 3t to the corresponding ethylene glycol monoesters in high yields.
Also, with sodium methoxide, methyl esters 5a–e were obtained near quantitatively. Whereas by reacting 3p with NaNH2, benzamide 6 was isolated in
95%.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have reported a new method
for the activation/functionalization
of the C(sp3)–H bond of benzylic acetals to form
2-acetoxy-1,3-dioxolanes. This C–H acetoxylation was achieved
in relatively simple condition without the usage of metallic reagents16 and is compatible with a wide variety of substituents
on the aromatic ring. Moreover, we have also demonstrated the potential
of the acetoxylated products in organic synthesis by conversions into
different carboxylic acid derivatives. Further investigations on synthetic
application toward other systems are currently underway in our laboratory.
