Operando analysis of electron devices
provides key information
regarding their performance enhancement, reliability, thermal management,
etc. For versatile operando analysis of devices, the nitrogen-vacancy
(NV) centers in diamonds are potentially useful media owing to their
excellent sensitivity to multiple physical parameters. However, in
single crystal diamond substrates often used for sensing applications,
placing NV centers in contiguity with the active channel is difficult.
This study proposes an operando analysis method using a nanodiamond
thin film that can be directly formed onto various electron devices
by a simple solution-based process. The results of noise analysis
of luminescence of the NV centers in nanodiamonds show that the signal-to-noise
ratio in optically detected magnetic resonance can be drastically
improved by excluding the large 1/f noise of nanodiamonds.
Consequently, the magnetic field and increase in temperature caused
by the device current could be simultaneously measured in a lithographically
fabricated metal microwire as a test device. Moreover, the spatial
mapping measurement is demonstrated and shows a similar profile with
the numerical calculation.

Introduction
Operando analysis is
a powerful tool for understanding the operation
and failure mechanisms of electron devices such as transistors1−3 and diodes.4,5 Various techniques such as scanning
probe microscopies,6−9 electron microscopies,10−12 and optical spectroscopies13 have been adopted to measure the potential,14−17 temperature,2−5,18−20 and defect
distributions13,21−23 in electron
devices under operation and thus obtain important information regarding
reliability and thermal management. Moreover, the spatially resolved
measurement of the current in the channel is important, particularly
for electron devices with inhomogeneous channels, such as thin-film
transistors based on poly-Si, amorphous Si, recently developed semiconducting
carbon nanotubes, and other low-dimensional materials. Although the
measurement of current distribution is important, reports on this
topic are fewer than those on the measurement of other physical parameters
such as potential and temperature because the direct measurement of
current is difficult. Indirect measurements of current distribution
have been realized by magnetic field measurements using scanning magnetic
force microscopy;24 however, this method
is not sensitive when the magnetic field is vertical to the direction
of magnetization of the probe.

The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers25 in
diamonds are recently attracting considerable research interest as
media for sensing multiple physical parameters such as magnetic field,
potential, and temperature with ultrahigh sensitivity26−31 via the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) method.32 Ensembles of NV centers in a single crystal
diamond have been adopted for the operando analysis of integrated
circuits,33 graphene devices,34 and diamond power devices.35 In these studies, a single crystal diamond containing NV
centers was placed on the integrated circuits or graphene, and diamond
devices were directly fabricated on single crystal diamonds. Although
the NV centers in single crystal diamonds generally have a long coherence
time36 and hence a high sensitivity during
the magnetic field detection, placing NV centers in contiguity with
the active channel of the device is difficult, thus limiting the variety
of devices on which operando analysis can be conducted. Therefore,
a universal method to configure NV centers on various types of electron
devices is required. Scanning probe microscopy with the tip attached
to NV centers is a powerful tool for analyzing nanoscale devices,37 however, the scan area is limited for microscale
electron devices.

This study proposes a method for the operando
analysis of various
electron devices using nanodiamonds. A nanodiamond thin film can be
directly formed onto various electron devices by simple solution-based
processes such as drop casting and spin coating.38−42 Moreover, because nanodiamond thin films are neither
conductive nor magnetized, they do not affect the measurement when
the device is under operation. To avoid the blinking phenomenon of
NV centers in nanodiamonds,43−48 this study introduces a lock-in method for ODMR measurements on
the basis of the detailed analysis of the noise spectrum of luminescence.
Furthermore, the magnetic field and increase in temperature owing
to the current flowing through a metal microwire lithographically
fabricated on a quartz substrate with a high signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) are successfully measured.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 illustrates
the test device and experimental setup. A metal wire with a width
of 11.3 μm fabricated on a quartz substrate was used as the
test device (Figure 1a). The nanodiamond film was directly formed on the sample by dropping
the nanodiamond suspension (see the Experimental
Section for the device fabrication and nanodiamond film formation).
An area of ∼5 mm in diameter was covered with a nanodiamond
film. The thickness and surface roughness of the nanodiamond film
were approximately 1.2 and 0.5 μm, respectively. A nanodiamond
film was uniformly formed on both quartz and metal wire surfaces,
as observed in the micrograph and scanning electron microscopy images
(Figure 1b,c, respectively).
The optical measurements were performed using a home-built setup with
a confocal microscope configuration as shown in Figure 1d (see the Experimental
Section for the details of optical measurement). The photoluminescence
spectrum of the nanodiamond film shows that negatively charge NV centers
are dominant emission center (see Supporting Information, Figure S1).

resonance (ODMR) measurement. For the lock-in method, a microwave
or voltage source is modulated at 1 kHz, and the lock-in amplifier
is synchronized with the frequency. In the operando measurement, the
bias voltage was applied to the sample by a function generator through
the probing needles settled on the XYZ stage.

Noise Spectrum of Photoluminescence of Nanodiamonds
First,
we investigated the blinking phenomenon in the photoluminescence
of nanodiamonds as this may degrade the sensitivity of the magnetic
field detection. Photoluminescence was measured by the photon counting
method using an avalanche photodiode (APD), and the noise spectrum
related to the blinking phenomenon was characterized by a vector signal
analyzer (see the Experimental Section for
the details). Figure 2a compares the fluctuation in the photoluminescence of a nanodiamond
thin film and a single crystal diamond (Element six, 145-500-0248).
Here, the time evolutions of the photoluminescence intensity normalized
by the average intensity were plotted. The thickness of the nanodiamond
was adjusted such that its average luminescence intensity was comparable
with that of the single crystal diamond. The fluctuation in the photoluminescence
intensity of the nanodiamond film was larger than that of the single
crystal diamond. The standard deviation in the fluctuation was 1.7
and 0.7% for the nanodiamond film and single crystal diamond, respectively.

Figure 2 Characterization
of photoluminescence of the NV centers. (a) Time
evolutions of luminescence intensity and (b) their noise spectra for
the single crystal diamond and nanodiamond thin film.

We further investigated the blinking phenomenon
by measuring the
noise spectrum of photoluminescence. Figure 2b shows the noise spectra of photoluminescence
for the nanodiamond film and single crystal diamond. In the case of
nanodiamond film, three noise components were observed in the noise
spectrum: (i) 1/f noise (2–200 Hz), (ii) spike-like
noises (30–200 Hz), and (iii) white noise (>200 Hz). In
the
case of single crystal diamond, 1/f noise was not
observed; moreover, compared with the nanodiamond film, the spike-like
noises were lower, and white noise was approximately equal. The surface
traps of nanodiamonds are a plausible cause of 1/f noise. Trap sites catch and release the charge of NV centers,43,45,49 and the charge state (neutral
or negative) determines the luminescence intensity of the NV center
because the lifetime of both states are different,44,50 causing fluctuations in the luminescence intensity. Although a single
trap level generates a Lorentzian noise spectrum, the 1/f noise spectrum is observed from multilevel traps with different
time constants. The nanodiamonds surfaces containing disorders (ex.,
primal sp2 defects, sp2–sp3 hybridization, functional groups, and adsorbed species) may be the
sources of charge traps.43,51,52

The spike-like noises were caused by the mechanical vibrations
of the measurement setup and by the fluctuation of excitation laser
intensity. The larger noise observed for the nanodiamond film is attributable
to the nonuniformity of the film, that is, the number of NV centers
under the excitation laser spot fluctuated due to mechanical vibration.
The white noise was the shot noise caused by the random statistical
fluctuations of the number of photons detected by the APD, which was
dependent on the luminescence intensity and not on the type of samples.
Therefore, we expect ODMR measurements with high SNRs using nanodiamonds,
similar to those using single crystal diamonds, by utilizing the shot-noise
region.

ODMR Measurement in the Shot-Noise Region
For ODMR
measurement with high SNR in the shot-noise region, we employed the
lock-in configuration shown in Figure 1d. In this case, the microwave was modulated at 1 kHz
for the lock-in detection of the ODMR signal (see the Experimental Section for the details). Based on the noise
spectrum analysis, the modulation frequency was determined to be in
the shot-noise region. Figure 3a,b shows the ODMR spectra measured using the photon counting
and lock-in methods, respectively. Here, the time required to measure
the ODMR spectra was almost the same (5 s/point) for both methods.
A clear Gaussian-shaped resonant dip, originating from an ensemble
of randomly oriented NV centers in the nanodiamond film, was obtained
in the ODMR spectrum measured using the lock-in method, whereas the
significant noise was detected in the ODMR spectrum measured using
the photon counting method. Note that the ODMR spectrum measured using
the present lock-in method represents the difference in the luminescence
intensities with and without the microwave input. Therefore, only
the response of the luminescence intensity to the microwave can be
detected (in this study, we call this response “differential
ODMR signal”), and the 1/f and vibrational
noises observed in Figure 2b are excluded. The SNRs (, where signal and σerr are the signal voltage and
standard deviation of error between the
measured spectrum and Gaussian fitting at 2870 MHz, respectively)
were evaluated to be 54.8 and 1.53 for the lock-in and photon counting
methods, respectively, showing a significant improvement in the SNR
when the shot-noise region is used.

Figure 3 ODMR spectra measured using the (a) photon
counting method and
(b) lock-in method in the shot-noise region.

Operando Measurement
We examined the possibility of
operando analysis with a nanodiamond film by measuring the ODMR response
to the current flowing through the metal microwire fabricated on the
quartz substrate. In this case, continuous microwave was the input;
however, a square-wave voltage of 0 to the maximum voltage (Vmax) with a duty cycle of 50% and a frequency
of 1 kHz was applied to the metal wire. Vmax was varied from 0 to 5 V. The current flowing through the metal
wire was 3.6 mA at 1 V. The differential ODMR signal, that is, the
change in the luminescence caused by the device current, was detected
by the lock-in amplifier synchronized with the applied square-wave
voltage at 1 kHz. This current modulation method for the lock-in measurement
simulates the device operation in the pulse width modulation (PWM),
which is normally used for power transistors in inverters and converters.53 Alternatively, the microwave modulation method
can be chosen for the lock-in technique in the case if a tested device
is normally operated at a static DC voltage.

Figure 4a shows the differential ODMR
spectra at six different current values, where the signal voltage
(lock-in output) was normalized by the luminescence intensity measured
by the single-photon counter for each data point. With the increasing
device current, the amplitude of the differential ODMR spectra increased
and the peak frequency slightly down-shifted, showing a clear response
to the device current. The spectral profile of the differential ODMR
signal can be explained by the peak splitting of the Gaussian-shaped
ODMR spectrum of an ensemble of randomly oriented NV centers, as illustrated
in Figure 4b. A resonant
dip observed for an individual NV center in ODMR splits owing to the
Zeeman effect under the influence of a finite magnetic field, and
the separation depends on the inner product of the magnetic field
and NV axis.26,54 The resonant frequency also depends
on temperature.31 At a low magnetic field
regime below ∼1 mT, it can be considered that the resonant
dip separation and frequency depend linearly on the magnetic field
and temperature, respectively.55 These
phenomena also occur in the case of the Gaussian spectrum of an ensemble
of randomly oriented NV centers in the nanodiamond film. In addition,
owing to the random orientation of the NV centers, broadening of the
Gaussian spectrum may occur under a magnetic field. The profiles of
the measured and illustrated differential ODMR spectra are presented
in Figure 4a,b, respectively.

ODMR spectra at various current values. The solid curves are the fitted
curve with eq 2. (b)
Schematic of the differential ODMR spectrum. The upper graph represents
a normal ODMR spectra with and without a device current. The lower
graph represents the differential ODMR spectrum. (c) Intensity of
the differential ODMR signal as a function of device current at a
microwave frequency of 2870 MHz. The solid curve is the fitted curve
with eq 2. (d) Peak frequency
of the differential ODMR spectrum as a function of device current.
The solid line is the fitted line.

Assuming the Gaussian function, the ODMR spectrum of an NV
center
ensemble can be expressed as 1  where A0, w, and fc are the amplitude
at zero magnetic field, width, and center frequency of the resonant
dip of the ODMR spectrum, respectively. y0 is the luminescence intensity at off resonance. The differential
ODMR spectrum, dS, as a function of device current, I, is given as 2  assuming
a low magnetic field regime. Here,
the first and second terms represent the spectra splitting due to
the magnetic field formed by the device current, and their separation
is proportional to I with a coefficient α.
The effect of temperature owing to the power dissipation can be considered
by adding the term βI2 to the center
frequency. This model agrees well with the differential ODMR spectra
experimentally obtained with fitting parameters of α = 1.4 MHz/mA,
β = 7.0 kHz/mA2, and w from 15.5
to 29.3 MHz, as observed in Figure 4a.

Figure 4c shows
the signal intensities as a function of current at a microwave frequency
of 2870 MHz. The signal intensity exhibited a nonlinear increase with
increasing device current. The nonlinear response to the current originates
from the Gaussian-shaped ODMR spectrum. The solid gray curve in the
figure is the fitted curve with eq 2 and shows good agreement. The minimum current detectable
using the present method is 210 μA for an acquisition time of
5 s/point. Further improvement in sensitivity can be achieved by optimizing
the thickness of the nanodiamond thin film.

The magnetic field
strength can be estimated from the signal intensity
by using the calibration curve as shown in the Supporting Information
(Figure S2). The procedure to obtain the
calibration curve is also described in the Supporting Information. The magnetic field strength at 10 mA was estimated
to be 1.0 mT in the magnetic field strength. The sensitivity for magnetic
field was estimated to be 14.4 μT (or 32.2 μT/Hz1/2) from the standard deviation of error between the measured data
and fitted curve with eq 2 in the calibration curve. Even though the sensitivity is poorer
than that obtained by the dynamical decoupling ODMR method (140 nT/Hz1/2 for nanodiamonds),56 the measurement
setup based on the lock-in technique is simpler and applicable for
devices with a high current driving ability such as power transistors.

A small peak shift was observed in the differential ODMR spectra
with increasing device current. Figure 4d depicts the peak frequencies as a function of current.
The frequency shift is probably attributable to the increase in temperature
owing to Joule heating generated by the current flow. The increase
in temperature was estimated to be ∼32 K at 17.7 mA by the
shift of peak frequency.31 The measured
change in temperature is comparable to that calculated from a steady-state
solution of the heat equation, , where Q is the heat dissipation, S is the area of the wire, and κ and t are the thermal conductivity and thickness of the quartz, respectively.
The resolution for temperature measurement was estimated to be 1.6
K from the standard deviation of error between the measured data and
linear fitting in the peak frequency–current plot as shown
in Figure 4d. Here,
we used the coefficient of −72.4 kHz/K for the relation between
temperature and the resonant frequency.31

It should be noted that the heat flow through the nanodiamond
film
may affect the temperature of device under test. The thermal conductivity
of nanodiamonds sintered at a high pressure and high temperature (7
GPa and 740 °C, respectively) has been reported to be 5 W/mK;57 however, we expect a lower thermal conductivity
for the as-deposited nanodiamond film by the drop-casting method because
of a lot of voids existing in the film. In order to avoid the influence
of the nanodiamond film, the film thickness should be thin enough,
so that, the thermal resistance is sufficiently higher than that of
the device or substrate. For the semiconductor substrates, which normally
have a thermal conductivity of >100 W/mK, the heat flow through
the
1.2 μm-thick nanodiamond film can be negligible (see Supporting
Information, Figure S8).

In the case
of power semiconductor devices, it is quite important
to measure the temperature and current distributions to detect the
formation of hot spots and current filaments for the reliability.58 The temperature under operation rises up to
∼150 °C due to the large Joule heating. It is known as
the median time of failure (MTTF), an important reliability index
of power devices, exponentially decreases with temperature. The NV
centers can be used as a temperature sensor in a wide range from 100
to 700 K.59,60 The temperature range and sensitivity of
the present technique is applicable for analysis of power devices
under operation.

Microscopic imaging can be achieved using a
confocal microscope
system. To demonstrate two-dimensional microscopic imaging, we measured
the differential ODMR signal at a microwave frequency of 2870 MHz,
scanning the motor-driven XY stage. Figure 5a–c presents the mapping results of
the differential ODMR signal at 0, 7.4, and 14.8 mA, respectively.
The profiles perpendicular to the metal wire are displayed in Figure 5d. Here, the differential
ODMR signal was converted to the magnetic field strength by using
the calibration curve (Supporting Information, Figure S2). The magnetic field increased with increasing device
current. We observed peak profiles at the edges of the metal wire
and gradual decays with increasing distance from the metal wire. A
similar two-peak profile was obtained from the calculated magnetic
field distributions, as shown in Figure 5e–h. Here, to consider half of the
thickness of the nanodiamond film, the magnetic field strengths that
are 0.6 μm away from the surface were plotted. The microscopic
images of the measured and calculated magnetic field strength showed
a similarity. The peak magnetic field was ∼1.2 mT at 14.8 mA,
which was in the same order as the simulated value. These results
suggest the possibility of the microscopic operando analysis of microdevices.
Taking a closer look, there are some differences between the measured
and calculated magnetic field profiles, especially, more significant
droop can be seen at the center of the wire in the experimental data
than in the calculated data. The reason is not clear at this moment;
however, it was found that the magnetic field profile strongly depended
on the distance from the metal wire surface in the calculation, and
that more significant droop appeared at the position closer to the
surface (see Supporting Information, Figure S9). Because of the drop-casting method, the thickness of the nanodiamond
film may fluctuate in the experiment. For a better accuracy in this
operando measurement technique, an improvement of the film formation
technique is necessary.

Conclusions
This study demonstrated
the possibility of simultaneous operando
analysis of current and temperature in electron devices using a nanodiamond
film containing NV centers. Results of the detailed noise analysis
show that ODMR measurements with high SNRs could be achieved in the
shot-noise region, excluding the large 1/f noise
and spike-like noises attributable to the NV centers of the nanodiamond.
The SNR using lock-in detection in the shot-noise region was improved
by a factor of 36 compared with the SNR using the photon counting
method. The magnetic field formed by the current and increase in temperature
owing to Joule heating could be evaluated for the metal wire under
bias from the differential ODMR measurement. The spatial mapping data
showed a similar profile for the calculated magnetic field distribution.
Because a nanodiamond thin film can be easily formed at room temperature
by a solution-based process directly onto the device surface without
disturbing the device property, the proposed method presents the possibility
of operando analysis of various types of electron devices.

Experimental
Section
Device Fabrication
Metal wires of Ti/Au (50/200 nm)
were fabricated on a 2 × 2 cm2 quartz substrate with
a thickness of 500 μm using photolithography, electron-beam
evaporation, and a lift-off process. The contact pads were also formed
simultaneously on the fringe of the sample for the electrical contact
with probing needles.

Nanodiamond Film Formation
The nanodiamond
film was
directly formed on the sample by dropping the nanodiamond suspension
(Sigma Aldrich, 798134-5ML) with diamond nanoparticles containing
∼800 NV centers with a diameter of ∼100 nm. The nanodiamond
suspension of 30 μL was dropped with a pipette and left to dry
in air at room temperature.

Photoluminescence Measurement
The
optical measurement
was performed using a home-built setup with a confocal microscope
configuration comprising an objective lens (100×, NA = 0.8).
An Ar-ion laser (Spectra physics, Stabilite 2017) with a wavelength
of 514.5 nm was used as the excitation light source. The measured
excitation power at the surface of the device was 100 μW. The
emission light was detected by an APD (Laser components, COUNT-10C-FC)
and counted by the single-photon counter (AUREA technology, SPD-TDC).
Noise analysis of the photoluminescence related to the blinking phenomenon
of nanodiamonds was performed using a vector signal analyzer (Hewlett
Packard, 89410A).

ODMR Measurement
The fundamental
optical setup for
ODMR measurement is the same as that for photoluminescence measurement
described above. The sample was mounted on an epoxy glass equipped
with a microwave planar ring antenna that was connected to a microwave
generator (Tektronix, TSG4104A) and placed on a motor-driven XYZ stage
equipped with probing needles. Furthermore, we used a digital lock-in
amplifier (NF Corporation, LI5640) for high SNR measurement in the
shot-noise region. The microwave was modulated at 1 kHz for the lock-in
measurement. For the operando device measurement, the bias voltage
was applied to the device through probing needles by a function generator
(Agilent, 33250A). In this case, the device was driven by a square
wave (duty ratio, 50%) at 1 kHz with a function generator. For both
cases, the time constant of the lock-amplifier was set to be 1 s.
In the measurement of ODMR spectrum, the microwave frequency was changed
with 0.5 MHz step, then after 5 s, the lock-in output voltage was
acquired.
