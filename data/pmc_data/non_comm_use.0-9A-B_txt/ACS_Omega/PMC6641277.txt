Through
nanochannels are created in the polymer/hybrid films by
irradiating swift heavy ions followed by selective chemical etching
of the amorphous latent track caused by irradiation. The dimensions
of the nanochannels are varied from 30 to 100 nm by either using small
(lithium) and large (silver) size of swift heavy ions with high energy
(80 MeV) or by embedding few percentage of two-dimensional nanoparticle
in the polymer matrix. The side walls of the nanochannels are grafted
with polystyrene using the free radicals created during irradiation.
Polystyrene graft is functionalized by tagging sulfonate group in
the benzene ring of polystyrene to make the nanochannels conducting
and hydrophilic. The proof of grafting and functionalization is shown
through various spectroscopic techniques. The relaxation behavior
and thermal stability of graft polymer within the nanochannel are
shown through different thermal measurements. Nanoclay in nanohybrid
nucleates the piezoelectric phase in the polymer matrix whose extent
is further increased in grafted and functionalized specimen. Functionalized
nanochannels exclusively facilitate proton conducting, whereas the
remaining part of the film is electroactive, making it as a smart
membrane. Greater water uptake, ion exchange capacity (IEC), high
activation energy (8.3 × 103 J mol–1), and high proton conduction (3.5 S m–1) make
these functionalized nanohybrid film a superior membrane. Membrane
electrode assembly has been made to check the suitability of these
membranes for fuel cell application. Open circuit voltage and potential
are significantly high for nanohybrid membrane (0.6 V) as compared
to pure polymer (0.53 V). Direct methanol fuel cell testing using
the membrane assembly exhibit a considerable high power density of
∼400 W m–2, making these developed membranes
suitable for fuel cell application and providing the ability to replace
standard membrane like Nafion, as the methanol permeability is low,
thus raising the higher selectivity parameter of the nanohybrid membrane.

Introduction
Working
on fuel cell has the potential to become an important energy
conversion technology over the last four decades. It has come mostly
from ion conducting polymer membranes. The current state-of-the-art
proton electrolyte membrane is Nafion, a DuPont product that was developed
in the late 1960s.1,2 It is still the yardstick of ion-conducting
membrane material for several electrochemical applications, e.g.,
low-temperature fuel cells, chloro-alkali electrolysis, and redox-flow
batteries. It stands for the family of perfluorosulfonic acids comprising
poly(tetrafluoro ethylene) as the backbone with perfluorinated side
chains of different lengths attached to the backbone through ether
linkages and terminated by sulfonic (−SO3M) cation
(M+) exchanging groups.3 Nafion
membrane has numerous major drawbacks, especially the membrane properties
and its complexity and cost of fuel cell systems, leading to lower
cell efficiency and potential.4 In view
of the fact that the membrane properties, difficulty in processing,
and cost of fuel cell systems are closely related, there is an apparent
need for optimized or conceptually new types of membrane.5,6 Apart from Nafion, new ionomer polymeric materials have played a
minor role in increasing the cell performance. Diluted liquid methanol
is used as fuel in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs), a subcategory
of proton exchange fuel cells, normally at less than 90 °C as
the source of protons. Ease of transport (methanol as fuel), energy
density, and rationally stable liquid at all of the environmental
conditions are the main benefits of this system. Swift heavy ion (SHI)
irradiation is a unique technique for inducing physical and chemical
changes in bulk polymeric films. It induces a continuous trail of
ionizations and excitations at the atomic level. It is interesting
to visualize modifications such as chain scission, cross-linking,
and structural alteration after SHI bombardment on polymers.7 Controlled SHI irradiation with fixed linear
energy transfer (LET) is responsible for structural modification,
latent track formation, track dimension, and ultimately development
of a porous membrane after selective etching of the predominantly
amorphous ion tracks.8 This capability
permits the optical visualization of the ion paths, which is considered
as the identification of the projectile. The physical and chemical
changes (e.g., chain scission, cross-linking, electric, and dielectric
properties) of different polymers have been reviewed depending on
LET.9,10 As a general rule, the bombardment of SHI
on polymers creates damage zones along its path and forms a latent
track due to its large electronic energy deposition.11,12 The track diameter depends on the mass and energy of the ions. In
most macromolecules, the latent tracks can easily be chemically etched,
and it is a well-known method to produce channels of varying diameter
and length in polymeric materials in a controlled way. The latent
tracks (or highly damaged cylindrical zones) are predominantly amorphous
in nature and can be used to initiate a phase transformation that
modifies, removes, or grafts materials along the channels. Poly(vinylidene
fluoride) (PVDF) and its copolymers are a thermoplastic polymer of
technological importance because of their distinctive pyroelectricity
(found by Bergman in 1971)13 and piezoelectric
(discovered by Kawai in 1969)14 properties, controlled porosity, biocompatibility, outstanding
membrane-forming capability, among others.15−17 Copolymers
of vinylidene fluoride with chlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE) are one
of the most important PVDF copolymers. PVDF is more polar with respect
to its copolymers; on the other hand, copolymers have a considerably
higher crystallinity, resulting in a larger piezoelectric responses.18 Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and its varying
copolymers can crystallize into at least five distinct crystal polymorphs
designated as α, β, γ, δ, and ε phases,
resulting in different ferroelectric properties.19 Compared with the nonpolar α polymorph, the polar
β and γ phases have attracted much attention because of
their exclusive physical properties and potential applications. To
prepare a polymeric porous membrane with suitable mechanical strength, pore size, pore continuity, and
for specific fine separation procedure still remain a challenge, which
are presently applied in different separation processes (such as ultrafiltration,
microfiltration and reverse osmosis) and energy field (fuel cell membrane
and Li-ion batteries). Nanohybrids made from PVDF and homogeneously
dispersed inorganic layered silicates have the potential to generate
smart membrane because of its piezoelectric β-phase.20 In our previous work, where nanochannels have
been created only using silicon (Si+7) as swift heavy ions
with different fluences followed by chemical etching ultimately developed
a fuel cell membrane through grafting and sulfonation in those nanopores.21 In this work, we first prepare nanochannels
using two different ions with varying sizes to see the effect of channel
size on fuel cell membrane using the CTFE copolymer. Finally, superior
alternative proton exchange membranes for fuel cells have been developed.

Results
and Discussion
Preparation of Nanochannels Using SHI
High-energy ion
beam–polymer matrix interaction has been used to create nanochannels,
and Li/Ag ions are irradiated on poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-chlorotrifluoro ethylene) and its nanohybrids with layered
silicate with a fluence of 5 × 107 ions cm–2. The passing of swift heavy ions (SHIs) through the polymer film
melts the surrounding matrix and a large amount of energy is deposited,
which, in turn, aligns the electron cloud more or less perpendicular
to the irradiation direction and extends the formation of latent tracks
(damaged zone to a cylinder along the ion path), predominantly amorphous
in nature. The dimension of the so-called latent track depends on
the physical and chemical nature of the matrix polymer, size of SHI,
and linear energy transfer (LET).26 The
nanometer dimensions through the channels are fabricated using SHI
followed by the selective chemical etching of the amorphous track.
Black holes indicated by the arrows designate the channels as evident
from the surface morphology of irradiated and etched specimens of
CTFE and its nanohybrid (Figure 1a). Interestingly, the dimension of the channels is
significantly higher in Ag-irradiated specimen as compared to Li-irradiated
sample, whereas the channel diameter is considerably less in nanohybrid
vis-à-vis pure CTFE for a particular ion. The distribution
of channel size is shown in Figure 1b, which compares the irradiation effect by Li vs Ag
(small and large ions effect) and pure CTFE vs nanohybrid (significance
of nanoparticle). The average channel diameter is 30 ± 5 nm using
Li ions irradiated CTFE as opposed to 15 ± 3 nm in a nanohybrid
at 5 × 107 ions cm–2 fluence, whereas
the dimensions become much larger of 110 ± 2 nm of neat CTFE
vis-à-vis 60 ± 7 nm for NH at the same fluence. Further,
the distribution of nanochannel is quite narrow in a nanohybrid as
compared to pure CTFE both for small- and large-ion beams. This strongly
indicates that the nanoparticle, homogeneously dispersed inorganic
layered silicates, restricts the growth of latent track during its
transition through the polymer film (Figure 1b). As our approach critically depends on
the development of nanochannels, this has also been corroborated through
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 1c) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Figure 1d), showing distinct
channels in SHI-irradiated species as indicated by the arrows. The
distribution of nanochannel diameters has been shown in the Supporting Figure S1 with the mean diameter of
175 ± 5 nm against the size of 200 ± 7 nm as observed through
the TEM for Ag-irradiated CTFE. Needless to say, neat CTFE and its
nanohybrid have no channel before etching (left side of scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images in Figure 1a). The good spherulitic pattern is clear in pristine
CTFE, whereas nanohybrid (NH) exhibits a needle-like morphology presumably
due to the structural change (α to β crystalline phase
conversion in the presence of nanoclay).27 However, nanochannels having a larger diameter are generated using
a bigger size Ag ion for irradiation as compared to a smaller channel
diameter using Li ion, whereas nanoclay reduces the size of the nanochannel
with a moderately uniform and narrower distribution.

CTFE and NH thin film before and after SHI

Grafting and Ionomers within
the Nanochannels
Irradiation
of swift heavy ions is known to create free radicals in the polymer
chains, as the energy deposition is very high as compared to the carbon–carbon
bond energy of the polymer.28 As SHI passes
through the bulk polymer, it is expected that free radicals are formed
in the entire polymer matrix and etching out of the amorphous latent
track exposes the free radicals inside the wall of the nanochannels.29 In other words, bulk free radicals become uncovered
after etching out of the amorphous zone, whereas the surface free
radicals turn out to be inactive after oxidation in air. This is to
mention that the samples are kept in atmospheric condition for quite
some time before the performance of etching experiment. However, the
free radicals in the channel walls are available for polymerization
reaction with vinyl monomer like styrene. The schematic of polymerization
within the nanochannel is shown in Figure 2a, which indicates the location and extent
of polymerization both in Li- and Ag-irradiated specimens. A shorter
channel diameter in the Li-irradiated samples has less grafting against
considerable grafting in the Ag-irradiated specimens. This is to mention
that the bigger dimension of Ag ion creates large-size nanochannels
against the formation of smaller-diameter nanochannels in the Li-ions-irradiated
species. Moreover, the filling out of the nanochannels after grafting
is confirmed through the TEM and AFM images of a thin slice of grafted
specimens in which the nanochannels (holes) are no longer observed,
instead white spots are clearly visible, especially the AFM images
establishing the tagging of polystyrene within the nanochannels (Figure 2b,c). Further, the
grafted species are sulfonated using chlorosulfonic acid and the chemical
grafting and subsequent functionalizations are confirmed through various
spectroscopic techniques. The intense bands at 1645 and 1540 cm–1 are attributable to the stretching vibrations for
the aromatic rings,30 indicating grafting
of polystyrene with CTFE chain, whereas two new peaks at 1270 and
1145 cm–1 corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric
S=O stretching vibrations,31 respectively,
confirm the sulfonation in the grafted specimens (Figure 2d). This is to mention that
the above peaks are categorically absent in pure CTFE and NH samples
before irradiation, and sulfonated polystyrene shows the peaks at
1215 and 1145 cm–1. The substantial shift from 1215
→ 1270 and 1145 → 1161 cm–1 after
sulfonation in this case is presumably due to the restricted conformation
of sulfonate groups in polystyrene graft in a confined geometry within
the nanochannels. Further, the bands at 840 and 1230 cm–1 in NH indicate β- and γ-crystalline phase, respectively,
against the characteristic band at 764 cm–1 for
α-phase in pure PVDF (Figure 2d).32 The intensities of
β- and γ-crystalline bands increase after grafting and
sulfonation presumably due to orientation of the chain in the confined
space within the nanochannel.20,291H NMR spectra
of pure CTFE and resulting CTFE-g-s and NH-g-s membranes are shown
in Figure 2e, which
indicates two distinguished peaks (a and b at δ = 2.3 and 2.8
ppm), corresponding to P(VDF-co-CTFE), are attributed
to the head-to-head (H–H) and head-to-tail (H–T) arrangements
of the VDF sequence.33 The appearance of
chemical shift at 8.2 ppm (d) is attributable to the −SO3H group of the polystyrene-grafted CTFE (CTFE-g-s). Further,
two chemical shifts (c and e) appear in the region of 6.1 and 8.8
ppm after functionalization presumably due to the greater number of
sulfonate group attached to polystyrene-grafted CTFE/NH membrane.20 However, the degree of sulfonation (DS %) has
been calculated from the ratio of the integral peak areas of c, d,
e, and a, b using eq 3, which indicates a noticeably higher sulfonation for nanohybrid
(NH-g-s) (38%) in comparison to CTFE-g-s (25%). Further, three new
peaks appeared at 6.9, 7.1, and 7.4 ppm in both grafted and sulfonated
CTFE/NH specimens due to aromatic protons of polystyrene side chain.
However, greater grafting and sulfonation are noticed in nanohybrid
vis-à-vis pure CTFE both from NMR and Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) measurements. In addition, π → π* transition
of the olefinic bond present in the organically modified nanoclay
in nanohybrid is noticed at 255 nm against no absorption peak for
pure CTFE (Figure 2f).34 Interestingly, a wide band at ∼380
nm is observed both for CTFE-g-s and NH-g-s membranes due to n →
π* transition of the sulfonate group, whereas a broader absorption
band for nanohybrid also indicates a greater grafting and subsequent
functionalization as compared to pure CTFE. It is worth mentioning
that pure polystyrene, prepared using benzoyl peroxide initiator,
shows the peak at 260 nm (Supporting Figure S2), and the red shift of ∼20 nm in this case may be due to
constrained conformation of polystyrene chain within the nanochannels.21,35 However, all of the spectroscopic techniques, viz., FTIR, NMR, and
UV–vis demonstrate grafting and sulfonation in the CTFE chain
within the nanochannels and considerably greater degree of grafting
and sulfonation occur in nanohybrid as compared to pure CTFE due to
a large number of free radicals available in the nanohybrid vis-à-vis
pure CTFE after irradiation. The proof of sulfonation and distribution
of nanochannels have been shown through energy-dispersive system (EDS)
mapping (Supporting Figures S6–S11) and compared with that of pure polymer. The details of the elements
present before and after sulfonation along with their percentage contribution
are presented in the Supporting Table S1. Sulfur is only present after sulfonation, and the higher relative
abundance of sulfur in functionalized nanohybrid is evident from the
table. This is to mention that free radicals caused by SHI are stabilized
in nanohybrid in the presence of nanoparticle, whereas it causes chain
session in pure CTFE.36

Relaxation and Thermal Stability of Grafted Species within Nanochannel
The functionalized membranes are dried under reduced pressure overnight
at 60 °C to check their thermal stability and relaxation behavior.
The loss of polymer weight was monitored under the heating program
and the degradation temperatures of CTFE and its nanohybrid are found
to be 388 and 320 °C, respectively, considering the degradation
temperature corresponding to a 5% weight loss (Figure 3a). Interestingly, grafted and functionalized
membranes exhibit three stages of degradation with the initial weight
loss of around 220–260 °C range due to the decomposition
of sulfonic acid group (−SO3H),37 whereas the second weight loss temperature of ∼320
°C is due to the degradation of polystyrene graft followed by
the degradation of CTFE main chain around 350 °C. Further, a
temperature scan in differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) clearly
shows the glass transition temperature at 100 °C, corresponding
to the Tg of polystyrene, both in graft
and functionalized CTFE irradiated with Li and Ag (Figure 3b). Moreover, a prominent second-order
phase transition (Tg) in Ag-irradiated
CTFE as compared to Li-irradiated species indicates greater grafting
in the Ag-irradiated system vis-à-vis Li-irradiated CTFE under
same fluence. Silver ions, being bigger in size, create a larger diameter
latent track, and the infusion of a greater number of free radicals
in the nanochannels by their high linear energy transfer (LET) thereby
causes a greater grafting as compared to Li-ion-irradiated specimens
in similar condition.38 This is to mention
that pure CTFE does not show any glass transition in the temperature
range mentioned. However, polystyrene graft within a very small nanochannel
(30–100 nm diameters) can relax at appropriate temperature.
The melting behavior of CTFE and its nanohybrid is presented in Figure 3c before and after
irradiation and functionalization showing a considerable decrease
in the melting temperature after grafting both for CTFE and nanohybrid
due to a greater interaction between CTFE and polystyrene chain. SHI
irradiation promotes amorphization in polymeric systems. The heat
of fusion (ΔH) decreases drastically from 35
to 6.5 and 30.2 to 16.7 J g–1 before and after grafting
and functionalization for neat CTFE and nanohybrid, respectively,
also indicating good interactions between grafted species and matrix
polymer. Pristine CTFE shows a double melting endotherm due to melt
recrystallization,34,35,39 and the melting temperature (Tm) decreases
after graft copolymerization followed by sulfonation, whereas higher Tm of nanohybrid has been explained from the
γ-phase formation in the presence of nanoparticle (layered silicate)
together with some β-phase as commonly induced by nanoclay.22,29,40

CTFE, CTFE-g-s with Ag ions irradiation, pristine NH, and NH-g-s with
same ions irradiation during first heating at a heating rate of 10°
min–1. (d) Experimental data for nitrogen permeability
of different indicated membranes. The irradiation was done with Ag
ions both for CTFE and its nanohybrid.

Now, it is well known that the gas permeability of nanohybrid
is
slightly less vis-à-vis neat polymer because of the increased
tortuosity of the path in the presence of dispersed two-dimensional
nanoclay in the polymer matrix.21,41 Gas permeation measurement
has been performed to understand the through pores arising from SHI
bombardment and its changes after chemical etching and subsequent
grafting. The lower permeability of nanohybrid (82 barrer) as compared
to pure CTFE (112 barrer) is explained from the greater tortuous path
in the presence of nanoclay, whereas very high permeability of 390
and 326.7 barrer for etched CTFE and NH, respectively, clearly indicate
the formation through channels as discussed above (Figure 3d). A slightly lower permeability
of etched nanohybrid is due to its smaller dimension of its nanochannel
as opposed to bigger diameter nanochannel in CTFE as reported in Figure 1a. Further, the permeability
significantly decreases after grafting of polystyrene to 227.6 and
214 barrer for CTFE-g and NH-g, respectively, primarily due to the
packing of the nanochannels after grafting. This is to mention that
the permeability of grafted specimen is considerably higher than that
of unirradiated specimens (pristine CTFE and NH), and the phenomenon
is explained from the greater orientation of grafted species within
the nanochannel, which maintains sufficient void inside the channel.
However, the relaxation and orientation of grafted specimens are evident
from the thermal and permeability measurement, which can be utilized
for better electrical conduction through nanochannel for fuel cell
membrane application.

Structural Alteration Due to Grafting and
Functionalization
XRD was employed to understand the change
in structure in the presence
of nanoparticle in nanohybrid and subsequently the effect of swift
heavy ions, grafting, and functionalization on the structure. The
XRD pattern of pure CTFE is similar to the PVDF structure and exhibits
peaks at 17.9, 19.9, and 26.5° corresponding to (020), (111),
and (120)/(021) nonpolar α-crystalline polymorph (TGTG)42 (Figure 4a), respectively. The incorporation of modified nanoclay into
CTFE matrix provides a shoulder at a 2θ value of 20.1°
corresponding to (200/110) planes of polar β-crystalline phase
(TTTT) due to greater interactions between nanoclay platelet and CTFE
chain.36,43 In other words, the clay platelets are sandwiched
by two β-crystal sheets due to the nucleating effect of nanoclay.
Interestingly, the β-peak intensity increases after grafting
within the nanochannels, which further increases after sulfonation
in the polystyrene graft. Further, silver-irradiated functionalized
specimen exhibits a higher β-phase as compared to Li-irradiated
and functionalized membrane. However, the β-phase fraction has
been quantified using deconvolution of XRD peaks (Figure 4b) and found to be 78% in Ag-irradiated
and functionalized membrane (NH-g-s) against 35% in unirradiated nanohybrid
(NH). The deconvolution of the other specimens (before and after irradiation
along with functionalized specimens) is shown in the Supporting Figure S3. This is to mention that β-phase
is the electroactive and/or piezoelectric phase whose percentage increment
strongly indicates the formation of piezoelectric smart membrane using
a nanohybrid and subsequent functionalization of SHI irradiated specimen.
A similar higher β-phase fraction has been reported by Garain
et al. using the transparent and flexible Ce(III) complex.44

Electrochemical and Electrical Behavior of
Functionalized Membranes
Apart from the morphological and
thermal stability, proton conductivity,
water uptake, ion exchange capacity (IEC), and methanol permeability
are the key properties of a good membrane. To accomplish good conductivity,
high acid loading is desirable, particularly when the grafting and
ionomer are chemically attached with the main chain.45−47 The proton conductivity of the functionalized membranes is measured
in the temperature range of 25–80 °C. All of the four
functionalized membranes exhibit higher conductivity at higher temperature,
showing the semiconducting nature of all of the membranes of the order
of S m–1 (Figure 5a). Functionalized nanohybrid membranes show considerably
higher conductivities as compared to functionalized CTFE, whereas
silver-irradiated and subsequently functionalized membranes, both
of CTFE and NH, show higher conductivities as compared to Li-irradiated
membranes mainly because of greater sulfonation in the nanohybrid
and silver-irradiated specimens. However, a high proton conductivity
of 3.5 S m–1 is achieved for NH-g-s at 25 °C.
It should be mentioned that Nafion 117 standard membrane exhibits
the proton conductivity value of 9.5 S m–1.48 Activation energies (Ea) are calculated from the slopes of the plot and shown in
the Supporting Figure S4 and the values
are presented in Table 1, which shows that the higher values for nanohybrid membranes as
compared to CTFE and slightly higher value of Ag-irradiated specimen
vis-à-vis Li-irradiated functionalized membrane is due to greater
sulfonation as discussed earlier. Water uptake (WU) is an important
criterion in determining the performance of a proton exchange membrane,
as water is required as the mobile phase to assist proton conductivity.
Nanohybrid membrane shows higher water uptake as compared to functionalized
CTFE membrane, whereas the Ag-irradiated specimen shows a greater
water uptake than Li-irradiated and functionalized membrane (Table 1). Ion exchange capacity
(IEC) is another vital parameter, which can control both its water
uptake and conductivity of a fuel cell membrane. The considerably
high value of IEC for Ag-irradiated and functionalized membrane is
reported as compared to Li-irradiated membrane along with the high
value of nanohybrid membrane vis-à-vis pure CTFE membrane (Table 1). As IEC and WU increase
from 0.30 to 0.41 mol kg–1 and 10 to 20% for the
nanohybrid membrane, respectively, the proton conductivity of the
membrane increases significantly from 1.22 to 3.46 S m–1 for CTFE-g-s-Li and NH-g-s-Ag specimens. It is evident that the
higher content of hydrophilic components and a large number of exchangeable
protons from −SO3H groups in the nanohybrids as
compared to CTFE is ultimately responsible for the greater efficiency
of the nanohybrid membrane. Similar proton conductivity up to 3.4
S m–1 at 50 °C was reported in the radiation-grafted
poly(ethylene-co-tetrafluoro ethylene).49 Moreover, lower methanol permeability (P) is another criterion of a good membrane for DMFC fuel
cell. Methanol cross-over is measured for different samples and reported
in Table 1. Results
clearly demonstrate that NH-g-s-Ag membrane has the lowest methanol
cross-over of 4.43 × 10–10 m2 s–1, exhibiting an all round better performance. Similar
low permeability of 2.05 × 10–11 m2 s–1 and moderate proton conductivity of 1.73 S
m–1 is reported in montmorillonite clay nanohybrid
membranes of sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone).50 However, the selectivity parameters (SPs), considered as
the efficiency of a membrane as calculated from the ratio of conductivity
and methanol permeability (κm/P),
show higher values for functionalized nanohybrid membranes ((0.27
× 1010 and 0.78 × 1010 S s m–3 for NH-g-s-Li and NH-g-s-Ag, respectively) and Ag-irradiated specimen
and subsequently functionalized membrane (0.56 × 1010 and 0.78 × 1010 S s m–3 for CTFE-g-s-Ag
and NH-g-s-Ag, respectively) as compared to pure CTFE and Li-irradiated
membrane (Table 1).
It is also noticed that SP values increase at a higher operating temperature
and the increment is higher for Ag-irradiated functionalized membranes.
Additionally, nanohybrid exhibits a higher SP value against CTFE-based
membrane primarily attributed to the dispersion of inorganic filler
present in the NH, which, in turn, forms a tortuous path along with
the comparatively smaller nanochannel dimension as opposed to easy
permeation and bigger dimension nanochannel in the CTFE systems.

Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics curves of CTFE and its nanohybrids before
and after
grafting and functionalization using Li and Ag ions exposed specimens
are shown in Figure 5b. As expected, pristine CTFE exhibits almost zero current both at
positive and negative bias, indicating its insulating behavior, whereas
irradiated and functionalized membranes demonstrate a systematic increase
in current with applied voltage. CTFE-g-s and NH-g-s films using Li
irradiation display a current of 4 and 6 nA at a bias voltage of 9
V, respectively. On the other hand, functionalized CTFE and its nanohybrid
films irradiated with Ag ions at the same fluence exhibit a higher
current of 10 and 16 nA, respectively. Now, it is important to discuss
why the silver-irradiated sample exhibits a higher current than the
lithium-irradiated sample. Silver ions, being bigger in size, generate
bigger diameter channels and a greater number of free radical due
to their higher LET, which, in turn, facilitates a greater degree
of grafting and sulfonation within the nanochannels. Moreover, the
electrical conduction in a nanohybrid is considerably higher than
that in CTFE due to large number of stable free radical generation
in the presence of a nanoclay, which creates greater grafting and
subsequent sulfonation, causing more conduction through the nanochannels
in the nanohybrid vis-à-vis CTFE. However, the creation of
grafting and subsequent functionalization is presented in a diagram
in Figure 5c. Further,
the I–V curves are slightly
asymmetric especially at a higher bias voltage possibly due to the
effective contact areas of the heterojunctions available within the
side wall of the nanochannels (Figure 5c). It is worth mentioning that conduction takes place
only through the nanochannels and the remaining part of the film remains
insulated and piezoelectric, giving rise to the creation of a smart
membrane.

Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) and Efficiency of Fuel Cell
A fuel cell is an electrochemical converter that generates energy
using chemical as the fuel. More specifically, a direct methanol fuel
cell (DMFC) is a category of proton electrolyte membrane fuel cell
that utilizes methanol as a fuel to produce electricity without the
use of any reforming unit. Methanol is oxidized at the anode, generating
protons, electrons, and carbon dioxide. The proton is transported
through the polymeric electrolyte membrane from the anode to the cathode
and then combines with oxygen and electron to complete the redox reaction
following the membrane electrode assembly like the one give in Figure 6a. Proton transport
through the membrane is very crucial for a fuel cell following hydration
of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA). The performances of the
polystyrene grafted and sulfonated specimens of CTFE copolymer and
its nanohybrid membranes are measured by recording the polarization
curves in DMFCs, which show a higher potential for nanohybrid vis-à-vis
CTFE (Figure 6b). Open
circuit voltage (OCV) is found to be 0.6 V for NH-g-s functionalized
membrane, higher than the value of CTFE-g-s (0.53 V). Needless to
mention that the standard Nafion membrane has the value of 0.68 V
in a similar condition of measurement (Supporting Figure S5). Nyquist plot for the membranes (both functionalized
pure polymer and nanohybrid) are shown in the Supporting Figure S12. High OCV value of NH as compared to
CTFE membrane lies on greater sulfonation in the β-phase in
the presence of nanoclay, which assists in better proton conduction
through the ionic nanochannel and enhances the performance of the
fuel cell. Direct methanol fuel cell performance using the conducting
nanochannel membranes (CTFE-g-s and NH-g-s) demonstrates maximum power
densities of 300 and 440 W m–2 at the current density
of 3.0 × 103 A m–2 (Figure 6b). A thinner membrane with
lower resistance displays advanced fuel cell performance.51 Wootthikanokkhan et al. have reported the proton
exchange membranes made by blending poly(vinylidene fluoride) with
sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) and applied in DMFC performance
having thermal stability at high temperature.52

Figure 6 (a)
Membrane electrode assembly (MEA) pattern using grafted and
functionalized membrane prepared through accelerator for the measurement
of a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC); the membranes used are CTFE-g-s
and NH-g-s irradiated with Ag ions. (b) DMFC performance curves for
MEAs made with indicated membranes. The efficacy of the nanohybrid
membrane is higher than that of pure polymer.

Therefore, ion beam irradiation leads to the formation of
free
radicals in the polymer chains whose extent is higher in nanohybrid.
The surface free radical gets oxidized with air, but the bulk free
radicals remain active after etching to create the nanochannel. Those
active radical can initiate grafting on CTFE/hybrid samples followed
by ionomer formation. The selectivity parameters, the degree of sulfonation
and water uptake, are considered for higher efficiency of fuel cell
especially for nanohybrid, showing superior efficacy of the membrane
for a fuel cell as compared to standard Nafion.

Conclusions
Nanometer dimension amorphous latent tracks have been created in
CTFE copolymer and its hybrid with layered silicates by irradiating
swift heavy ions. Through nanochannels are fabricated by selective
etching of those amorphous tracks that are further grafted with polystyrene
using the free radicals formed in the polymer chains during irradiation.
The diameter of the nanochannels is varied from 30 to 100 nm using
ions of different sizes (Li or Ag). Polystyrene graft within the nanochannels
is functionalized to generate the sulfonate group exclusively within
the nanochannels. The dimension of nanochannel is explored through
SEM, TEM, and AFM micrographs, showing bigger size using silver ion
for irradiation. Grafting and subsequent functionalization are confirmed
through NMR, FTIR, and UV studies. Glass transition temperature of
polystyrene graft within the confined space is measured by using DSC,
and thermogravimetric studies indicate thermal stability of the membrane
up to 200 °C. Nanoclay induces the piezoelectric β-phase
in the polymer whose abundance becomes high after functionalization.
Proton conductivity of the functionalized membrane is found to be
very high (∼3.5 S m–1) due to the migration
of protons through the hydrophilic conducting nanochannels. Higher
conduction in silver-irradiated membrane as compared to that in lithium-irradiated membrane is due to the greater volume of the
nanochannel higher degree of sulfonation using Ag as SHI. Methanol
permeability, water uptake, and mechanical stability of the functionalized
membrane are suitable for its application in fuel cell. Membrane electrode
assembly (MEA) has been designed with the developed nanohybrid membranes
and found to generate 440 W m–2 of power density
at the current density of 3.0 × 103 A m–2. So, the developed nanohybrid membrane has every quality to replace
the standard membrane like Nafion.

Experimental Section
Materials
A commercial powdered SOLEF 31008, a copolymer
of vinylidene fluoride and chlorotrifluoro ethylene, is used in this
work and termed as CTFE afterward; it was kindly supplied by Ausimont,
Italy (MFI: 15 g/10 min, @ 230 °C, 5 kg). Cloisite 30B [bis(hydroxyethyl)
methyl tallow ammonium ion exchanged montmorillonite], Southern clay,
CEC 110 mequiv/100 g is used as a nanofiller. (Tallow is a mixture
of C16 and C18 long-chain alkenes.) Sodium hydroxide
and potassium permanganate (NaOH, KMnO4), LOBA Chemie,
are used as an etchant and potassium metabisulfite (K2S2O5, Sigma-Aldrich) is used for the cleaning purpose.
Styrene monomer (Sigma-Aldrich) and toluene (LOBA Chemie) are used
for grafting and distilled before polymerization. Chlorosulfonic acid
(ClSO3H, LOBA Chemie) is used for sulfonation on grafted
species.

Specimen Preparation
The CTFE nanohybrids are prepared
through the solution route by dissolving CTFE in the dispersion of
4 wt % of nanofiller using dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent as reported
in the literature.22 Henceforth, the nanohybrids
will be designated as NH with 4 wt % of nanoclay in the polymer template.
Detailed membrane preparation technique is reported in the literature.20

Membrane Preparation and Functionalization
The CTFE
and its nanohybrid (NH) specimens of size 25 μm thick are placed
on a ladder for irradiation in a vacuum chamber of 5 × 10–6 mbar in a Pelletron accelerator at the Inter University
Accelerator Center, New Delhi, India. The films are then irradiated
with heavy ions beams of 80 MeV Li3+ or 120 MeV Ag11+ ions separately with a ion fluence of 5 × 107 ions cm–2 to ensure the effect of ion size on
membrane properties. The energy of the beam is so chosen that the
ions pass through the film without their implantation in the polymer
matrix. For ion fluence, scattered ions from a thin gold foil (250
μg cm–2) in general purpose scattering chamber
are used for the preparation of fuel cell membrane having the size
of 4 × 4 cm2. To fabricate tracks, the irradiated
CTFE and its nanohybrid films are chemically etched using a mixture
of permanganate solution (0.25 mol L–1) and a highly
alkaline medium (9 mol L–1) at 60 °C for 3
h and the etching and grafting procedure is followed from our previously
reported literatures.21,35 Sulfonation of grafted CTFE and
its NH film has been conducted in the presence of chlorosulfonic acid
at 60 °C for 30 min. The sulfonated films are cleaned with deionized
water until the residual water has a pH of 7 and the remaining water
at the surface is absorbed with a filter paper and dried at 60 °C
overnight under reduced pressure. Hereafter, the etched, etched +
grafted, and etched + grafted + sulfonated specimens are designated
as -e, -g, and -g-s, respectively. The water uptake of the functionalized
membrane (4 × 4 cm2) is measured by immersing the
membrane in deionized water at 25 °C for 24 h. Water swollen
specimen was taken out, cleaned up with tissue paper, and instantly
weighed. The water uptake of the prepared membranes is determined
following eq 1 and has
been taken as the average of three specimens 1  where Wwet and Wdry are the weights of water swollen and the
dried membrane, respectively. Ion exchange capacity (IEC) was determined
by equilibrating the membrane in 2.0 M HCl to convert the membrane
into acidic form. The membrane was then washed with double distilled
water and equilibrated to remove the last traces of acid. Then, it
was equilibrated in 2.0 M NaCl for 24 h for ion exchange to take place.
The remaining solution was titrated with 0.025 M NaOH solution using
phenolphthalein as an indicator. The IEC values are calculated using eq 2 2  where VNaOH and SNaOH are the volume and molar concentration
of NaOH solution used for titration, respectively. Wdry is the weight of the dried specimen.

Materials Characterization
The morphology of the porous
membrane is explored using a scanning electron microscope (SUPRA 40,
Zeiss) after gold coating by means of a sputtering apparatus, and
the EDS mapping of different functionalized specimens have also been
taken. Samples for transmission electron microscopy were taken using
a TEM (Technai G2) at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV
for CTFE films (etched and grafted specimens). NT-MDT multimode AFM,
Russia, controlled by a Solver scanning probe microscope controller,
was used to study the surface morphology of the membranes in a semicontact
mode with the tip mounted on 100 μm long single cantilever with
a resonant frequency in the range of 240–255 kHz and the corresponding
spring constant of 11.5 N m–1. The current–voltage
(I–V) characteristic of the
specimen was measured using scanning tunneling microscopy mode attached
to the AFM instrument. The samples were placed from −9 to +9
bias voltages at room temperature.

A method (three parallel
cells) has been used for the gas permeabilities of neat CTFE and its
NH membrane using pure nitrogen (N2) gas under constant
pressure as described earlier in the literature.23 The detail procedure is given in the literature.35

The degree of sulfonation of the functionalized
membranes was estimated
through 1H NMR (in DMSO-d6 solvent)
using a BRUKER spectrometer at room temperature. The degree of sulfonation
DS (%) was evaluated from the ratio of integrals areas of the peaks, following eq 3 3  where X and Y are the integration areas of the peaks assigned as c,
d, e, and
a, b as mentioned in Figure 3a. Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectrum was taken
in the reflectance mode at room temperature from 400 to 4000 cm–1 using a Nicolet 6700 FTIR with a resolution of 4
cm–1. UV–visible (Jasco V-650) measurement
was done in the range of 200–800 nm in the reflectance mode
using solid specimens. Thermal decomposition tests of CTFE and its
nanohybrid membranes were carried out with a thermogravimetric analyzer
(TGA) (Mettler-Toledo). The TGA thermograms were recorded at a scan
rate of 20 °C min–1 up to 600 °C in nitrogen
atmosphere. The glass transition (Tg)
and melting (Tm) temperature of the membranes
were carried out on a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) using
a Mettler 832 instrument in the temperature range of 25–200
°C at a scan rate of 10° min–1 under N2 atmosphere.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded
using a Rigaku miniflex
600 X-ray diffractometer with the scanning rate of 2° min–1 at room temperature operating under a voltage of
40 kV and a current of 15 mA using Cu Kα radiation (λ
= 1.54 Å).

Electrochemical Measurements
Conductance
of functionalized
membrane is carried out in humidified condition using alternating
current impedance spectroscopy by a potentiostat/galvanostat frequency
response analyzer (Auto Lab, model PGSTAT 30). Experimental details
are reported in the literature.34 Temperature-dependent
conductivity was measured in a wide range of temperature from 25 to
80 °C. The activation energy (Ea),
the minimum energy required for the proton transport across the membrane,
has been calculated using Arrhenius equation (eq 4) 4  where R is the
universal
gas constant (8.314 J mol–1 K–1) and T is the temperature in absolute scale (K).

Methanol cross-over of the graft and sulfonated specimen was measured
from the refractive index measurement using a digital refractometer
(Mettler Toledo RE40D). A diaphragm diffusion cell consisting of two
compartments was fabricated following previously reported technique.24

The methanol permeability (P) was obtained from eq 5 5  where A is the effective
membrane area, L is the thickness of the membrane, CB(t) the methanol concentration
in compartment B at time t, CA(t – t0) is the change in the methanol concentration in compartment A between
time 0 and t, and VB is
the volume of compartment B. All of the tests were carried out at
30 °C. The inaccuracy of the measurement was less than 2%. Methanol
permeability value was used to calculate the selectivity parameter
(SP) using eq 6 6  where PMeOH is
the methanol permeability (m2 s–1).

The membrane electrode assembly (MEA) was prepared by the earlier
reported method and consisted of a three-layer structure (AM, anode/cathode
catalyst layer and diffusion layers).25 MEA preparation procedure is being followed from our previously
reported literature.34
