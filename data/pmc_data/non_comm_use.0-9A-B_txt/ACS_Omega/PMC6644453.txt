the fabrication, characterization
of versatile, and low-cost filter paper-based surface-enhanced Raman
spectroscopy (SERS) substrates loaded with salt-induced aggregated
Ag/Au nanoparticles (NPs). These were demonstrated as efficient SERS
substrates for the detection of multiple explosive molecules such
as picric acid (5 μM), 2,4-dinitrotoluene (1 μM), and
3-nitro-1,2,4-triazol-5-one (10 μM) along with a common dye
molecule (methylene blue, 5 nM). The concentrations of the dye and
explosive molecules in terms of mass represent 31.98 pg, 11.45 ng,
1.82 ng, and 13.06 ng, respectively. Silver (Ag) and gold (Au) colloidal
NPs were prepared by femtosecond laser (∼50 fs, 800 nm, 1 kHz)
ablation of Ag/Au-target immersed in distilled water. Subsequently,
the aggregated nanoparticles were achieved by mixing the pure Ag and
Au NPs with different concentrations of NaCl. These aggregated NPs
were characterized by UV–visible absorption and high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy techniques. The SERS substrates were
prepared by soaking the filter paper in aggregated NPs. The morphologies
of the paper substrates were investigated using field-emission scanning

Introduction
Surface-enhanced Raman
spectroscopy (SERS) is a simple and nondestructive
technique which promises numerous applications such as the trace detection
of drugs, explosives, food contaminants, biological entities, and
environmental hazardous gases.1−8 In SERS technique, the intensity of inelastically scattered photon
from the molecule can be enhanced using the long-range electromagnetic
(EM) field and short-range chemical effects. EM enhancement is attributed
to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in the near-field
metallic surface, and the chemical enhancement is because of the charge
transfer (CT) mechanism between the substrate and the analyte. Generally,
the enhancement because of the CT is 1–3 orders of magnitude
smaller than that of EM.9 The interaction
of the incident EM field with metal nanoparticles (NPs) possessing
negative real and small positive imaginary (absorption) dielectric
constant induces a collective and coherent electron oscillations,
called plasmons, in the vicinity of the NP. At the overlap of the
near-field regions between adjacent NPs called “hot-spots”,
the local field enhancement is superior.10,11 Several techniques have been employed to fabricate SERS substrates
(metal nanostructured patterns) such as electron beam lithography,
focused ion-beam lithography, atomic layer deposition, and ultrafast
pulsed laser ablation producing a variety of patterned nanostructures.12−16 These experimental techniques are expensive and also complex procedures
need to be followed in the preparation of SERS platforms. In practical
SERS applications, the prepared traditional rigid substrates (Si wafer,
glass, and metal) have numerous drawbacks because of the difficulty
in collection efficiency and manipulation of the solid samples.

Ideally, SERS substrates should not only have multiple numbers
of hotspots and capability of low-detection limit but also should
be versatile in many aspects such as uniformity, reproducibility,
scalability, and cost. The main challenge for the SERS community is
to develop a low cost, easy to handle, flexible, and sensitive practical
SERS substrates, especially for the detection of trace hazardous materials.17−19 A common filter paper (FP) loaded with metal NPs serves as the versatile
SERS substrate. The cellulose-rich paper has attracted growing interest
in various applications, such as food safety, sensing devices, cancer
screening, solar cell, and paper electronics such as to build a various
electronic component (diode, transistor, antenna, superconductors,
etc.).20,21 The tremendous attributes of cellulose paper
such as the thinness of cellulose fibers, porosity, sample storage
capability, lightweight, disposable, handy, flexible (rolled or folded),
and annual renewability serve as the versatile SERS substrate. Different
methods are available for the fabrication of simple and low-cost paper-based
SERS substrates such as inkjet printing, screen printing, and wax
printing NPs on cellulose paper.22−28 These techniques require the formulation of NPs ink as an appropriate
liquid carrier for proper viscosity and surface tension. NPs made
of noble metals, such as silver (Ag) and gold (Au) are extensively
utilized materials in the preparation of SERS substrates because of
their fantastic properties such as LSPR in the visible region relative
to other metals. Polavarapu et al. recently demonstrated a “pen-on-paper”
approach for creating SERS substrates and obtained average enhancement
factors (EF) of 2 × 105 and 1.5 × 105 at excitation wavelengths of 532 and 785 nm, respectively, utilizing
the Ag NP substrates for malachite green (MG-1 × 10–6 M) dye.29

Oliveira et al. reported
high reproducibility with good uniformity
and high SERS enhancement (EF ≈ 107) with office
paper SERS substrates using Ag nanostars drop-casted in wells and
patterned in the paper using printed wax.26 Ngo et al. reported the performance of robust and recyclable Au
NP-loaded FP SERS substrate prepared with the simple approach of dip-coating
and detected the molecule 4 NTP (∼1 nM).24 Herein, two typical routes have been pursued to improve
the efficacy of paper-based SERS platforms by inducing the aggregation
of NPs: (1) salt-induced aggregation and30 (2) paper-induced aggregation.31 These
NPs tend to aggregate under specific chemical conditions (in the presence
of ionic liquids) and are termed as salt-induced aggregation. The
three-dimensional network of cellulose fibers on paper enables the
transition of NPs in colloidal solution to solid state with aggregation
of NPs, called paper-induced aggregation. Multiple metal NPs when
brought together to form aggregates yield high field strength and
many orders of magnitude greater than the fields at the surface of
individual NP. This could be attributed to the coupling of their transition
dipoles, that is, each particle’s enhanced field interferes
coherently at the junction between the aggregated NPs.32,33 Several reports have shown the significant increment in SERS signals
from intentionally aggregated Ag and Au NPs. Xu et al. observed large
EFs (∼1010) between two Ag NPs separated by 1 nm.34 Kneipp et al. explained the effect of SERS signal
on NaCl (10–2 M)-activated Ag colloidal aggregates
in different stages and observed an increase in EF by 7–8 orders
of magnitude through the formation of aggregates.35 Theoretical estimates also demonstrated the enhancement
of local field in the interparticle gaps of closely spaced NPs.36 In the present work, paper SERS substrates were
prepared by soaking the FP in aggregated NPs achieved with different
concentrations of NaCl. The aggregation effects improved the number
of hotspots (interstitial gaps formed between the NPs to entrap the
analyte molecule which enhance the SERS signal).11 The synthesized active plasmonic paper SERS substrate is
an ideal platform for building portable miniature for the detection
of adsorbed molecules with high specificity and sensitivity, especially
for explosive detection in countering terrorist extortions, trace
amounts of contaminants, pollution of soil, and disease diagnostics.37,38 To fabricate noble metal NPs, numerous techniques were investigated
and implemented including chemical methods, citrate reduction method,
electrochemical methods, and laser ablation in liquids (LAL).39−43 In the present case, plasmonic NPs were fabricated through LAL technique,
which has the advantages of fast, easy, and green approach,44 devoid of long reaction times and multistep
chemical processes.45 During the last few
years, the laser ablation of bulk targets (metals, semiconductors,
etc.) immersed in liquid has augmented in popularity because of the
tremendous advantages over the chemical routes. High surface-purity
NPs are achieved in a chosen solvent without any counterions and residuals
of the reducing agents on the surface. Such NPs produced without any
capping agent are very useful in SERS studies. Au and Ag NPs were
fabricated by laser ablation of Ag/Au in liquid. Later, the aggregated
NPs were achieved by mixing the pure Ag/Au NPs in different concentrations
of NaCl. Plasmonic SERS substrates were prepared by soaking the FP
in metal (Ag/Au) NP aggregates which are self-assembled in solution46 by the addition of the NaCl molecule. These
SERS substrates were enabled to detect the dye-like methylene blue
(MB—5nM) and explosives such as picric acid (PA—5 μM),
2-4-dinitrotoluene (DNT—1 μM), and 3-nitro-1,2,4-triazol-5-one
(NTO—10 μM) using a portable Raman spectrometer.

Characterization
of the NPs
UV–Visible Absorption Spectra
To achieve the
aggregated NPs, initially pure Ag/Au NPs were suspended in different
concentrations of NaCl (from 1 mM to 1 M) solutions and their absorption
studies were investigated by placing 3 mL of colloidal solution in
1 cm quartz cuvette using the UV–visible (PerkinElmer, LAMBDA
750) absorption spectrometer in the wavelength range of 300–800
nm. Figure 1a,b illustrates
the absorption spectra of pure Ag and Au NPs mixed with different
concentrations of NaCl.

Figure 1 UV–visible absorption spectra of (a)
nonaggregated spherical
Ag NPs with λmax = 404 nm; aggregated spherical Ag
NPs with different NaCl concentrations and (b) nonaggregated spherical
Au NPs with λmax = 520 nm; aggregated spherical Au
NPs with different NaCl concentrations.

For pure Ag NPs, SPR position was located at ∼404
nm. It
is obvious that the addition of NaCl solution resulted in decreased
absorption, possibly because of the aggregation effect. A broadening
along with a redshift in the plasmon band (∼512 nm) was also
observed which is clearly depicted in the inset of Figure 1a. In the case of pure Au NPs,
the SPR peak is located at ∼520 nm. By adding various concentrations
of NaCl (up to 50 mM), a slight broadening and a small red shift in
SPR peak were noticed which could be attributed to the formation of
small aggregates of colloidal Au NPs. However, in the case of higher
concentrations of NaCl (from 100 mM), more broadening and red-shift
(SPR peak near 678 nm) was observed. The possible reason for this
is the replacement of smaller aggregates into larger aggregates at
higher concentrations. Because of the aggregation effect, a shift
in the plasmon peak position, broadening of SPR peak, and color change
of the colloidal solution was noticed in earlier works, which was
attributed to the chemical interface damping.47 The results observed in this study matched well with the theoretical
and experimental investigations of Mehrdel et al.47 The change of the SPR peak from shorter to longer wavelengths
is evident from the change in the color of colloidal solution (Figure S1). The absorption of pure Ag/Au NPs
on the FP (Figure S2) was also recorded,
and a broadening in the SPR peak on FP was noticed compared to that
of NPs in solution, which could be ascribed to the paper-induced aggregation
of NPs (shown in Figure S3).

Transmission
Electron Microscopy (TEM) Analysis of Colloidal
NPs
Particle sizes and morphology of the NPs were investigated
using transmission electron microscopy with an electron-accelerating
voltage of 200 kV, whereas selected-area electron diffraction (SAED)
pattern was utilized to identify the structural characterization and
constituents of NPs. The shape of Ag/Au NPs was almost spherical (Figure 2a,c). The average
size of Ag and Au NPs was ∼10.3 and ∼6.5 nm (insets
of Figure 2a,c). The
interplanar spacing (d111) obtained through
high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images was 0.24 nm for Ag and 0.232 nm
for Au NPs (Figure 2b,d). SAED patterns revealed the polycrystalline nature of fabricated
Ag/Au NPs (insets of Figure 2b,d). The aggregation of Ag/Au NPs after the addition of NaCl
(50 mM) was also confirmed from the TEM image data presented in Figure 3a,b.

water at lower and higher magnifications. Inset of (a,c) and (b,d)
depicts their size distribution and SAED patterns, respectively.

Before field-emission scanning
electron microscopy (FESEM) characterization,
a thin conductive layer of gold was sputtered on the FP to facilitate
the lower magnification images because of a nonconductive nature of
FP substrate. FESEM (Carl Zeiss model Merlin Compact 6027) measurements
were conducted with a beam voltage of 30 kV to investigate the morphology
of the aggregated NPs on the FP surface. Interweaved cellulose fibers
of porous bare FP with the high surface area are shown in Figure S4. It can provide a fine adsorption capability
using capillarity action for the NPs and the analyte molecule.22 For comparison, the FP loaded with Ag/Au NPs
without NaCl at lower and higher magnification images are provided
in Figure S5.

The FPs loaded with
aggregated Ag NPs at different concentrations
of NaCl (1 mM, 10 mM, 50 mM, 100 mM, 500 mM, and 1 M) are illustrated
in Figure 4a–f.
Similarly, FPs are loaded with the aggregated Au NPs, as shown in Figure 5a–f, for concentrations
ranging from 1 mM to 1 M. In the case of FP loaded with NPs at very
lower concentrations of NaCl (1 and 10 mM), fairly few aggregates
are observed and are distributed on the cellulose fibers. At higher
concentrations of NaCl (500 mM and 1 M), a large number of NP aggregates
are observed because of an excessive amount of NaCl (Figures 4e & 5e). The excess aggregation of NPs may possibly limit the number of
hotspots or help in forming the precipitate on the cellulose fibers
which may also inhibit the formation of hotspots. Therefore, a higher
concentration of NaCl solution will induce a significant impact on
aggregation of Ag/Au NPs and forms clusters on the fibers. The higher
magnification images revealing the distribution of aggregated Ag/Au
NPs on the paper substrates could be because of the salt-induced aggregation
in addition to the paper-induced aggregation. From Figures S6 and S7, the distribution of NPs and over-precipitate
of aggregated NPs on the FP fibers are evident. However, SEM images
of FP loaded with Ag/Au NPs at 50 mM NaCl concentrations clearly demonstrated
the distribution of high-density NPs on the cellulose fibers. The
energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum further confirmed that the presence
of Ag (weight ∼80%) was higher compared to Na and Cl on the
FP surface (presented in Figure S8). We
also noticed the other elements such as carbon (C) and oxygen (O),
arising from the inherent elements of cellulose fibers. The FP loaded
with Ag/Au NPs at 50 mM NaCl concentration depicted higher density
of the NPs embedded, leading to plenty of EM hotspots evenly distributed,
and will act as efficient SERS substrate compared to other substrates.

Acquisition of Raman Spectra and SERS Enhancement Factor
All of the Raman spectra were acquired with a portable Raman system
(BWTEK) in the spectral range of 170–2000 cm–1. A solid-state laser operating at 785 nm with power scalable in
the range of 3–300 mW was used as the excitation source. The
Raman system is equipped with a micropositioning system for fine XYZ adjustments. SERS data were collected with a laser power
of ∼25 mW from an average of three spectra, and the integration
time used was 5 s. Before the Raman measurements were initiated, the
intensity of the Raman peak at 520 cm–1 from silicon
was verified for each data acquisition. Initially, the Raman spectra
were acquired on plane FP, and the peak noticed at ∼1094 cm–1 is attributed to the C–O–C bending
mode of cellulose fibers.48,49 High scattering was
observed from the FP because of its porous structure and the random
cellulose matrix. After soaking, a reduction in the Raman intensity
of the 1094 cm–1 mode was observed which could possibly
be due to the distribution of Ag/Au NPs over the cellulose fibers;
the Raman spectra of FP with and without NPs are shown in Figure S9. The EF was estimated using the relation
EF = (ISERS × CR)/(IR × CSERS), where ISERS is the
Raman signal intensity with NPs on FP, IR is the Raman intensity on FP (without NPs), CSERS is the concentration of sample on NP substrates (low concentration),
and CR is the concentration of sample
(0.1 M) which produces the Raman signal (IR). The bulk Raman spectra of PA, DNT, NTO, and MB were recorded with
a concentration of 0.1 M on plane FP without loading the NPs and were
acquired at the same conditions (Figure S10).

Results and Discussions
Salt Aggregation Effect
To reduce
the preparation time
of paper-based SERS substrates, the FP was soaked in aggregated NPs,
which decreased the soaking time from few hours to few minutes (in
the present study, it was ∼30 min) compared to earlier reports.
Because of the aggregation of NPs, generated hotspots will be more,
which will play a vital role in the enhancement of SERS.30,50,51 Jana et al. proposed that the
SERS signal will be affected based on salt-induced particle aggregation.52 They suggested three reasons: (a) an increase
in the EM field at the junction between the particles, (b) CT also
possibly contributes to the enhancement, and (c) absorption/reorientation
of the analyte is likely because of the induced anion. Initially,
the SERS spectra of MB were collected in the presence of NaCl. MB
is a common dye mainly used in textiles, bacteriology, and also causes
eye and skin irritations and is toxic to microorganisms. Different
SERS substrates were investigated to understand the effect of aggregation:
(i) FP soaked in aggregated Ag/Au NPs solution (with NaCl) and (ii)
pure colloidal NPs (without NaCl). The photo of soaked FP with and
without NaCl are mentioned in the schematic (inset of Figure 6). The color of aggregated
NPs (mixed with NaCl) loaded on FP was much darker than that of the
pure NPs (Figure 6).
It indicates that NaCl has greatly improved the aggregation capacity
of NPs. The SERS spectra can be achieved from coherent oscillations
of conduction electrons near the surface of noble metal NPs, which
is known as the LSPR. The LSPR in NPs is sensitive to dielectric environment,
making it an excellent candidate for obtaining huge enhancements.9 The aggregation of the metal NPs was influenced by environmental parameters
(pH and ionic strength), and external factors such as light and heat
also effect NP aggregation.27 The SERS
spectra of MB with and without the addition of NaCl are illustrated
in Figure S11. Because of the scaffold
region of porous and fibrous FP, the NPs were immobilized leading
to SERS signal without a salt solution. Furthermore, the presence
of NaCl induced the aggregation of NPs rendering a narrow interparticle
gap of adjacent NPs, which cooperates with plasmons in improved SERS
enhancement. Nobel metal NP aggregates on FP support a large number
of plasmonic hotspots within the wide range of hotspots which yielded
highly enhanced SERS signals.53 We could
observe ∼three times increment in the Raman signals from the
salt-induced aggregation of the plasmonic NPs (Ag: 2451, Au: 889)
than that of the paper-induced aggregation of NPs (595) for the 1620
cm–1 significant Raman peak of MB. Strongest SERS
signals were observed in the case of FP loaded with aggregated Ag
NPs compared to Au NPs, and this could be attributed to the strong
optical excited plasmonic effect offered by the Ag NPs.

SERS substrates (Ag/Au-aggregated NP-loaded FP). Inset shows the photograph
of bare and Au NP-loaded FP.

To optimize the NaCl concentration, the achieved SERS substrates
with Ag/Au NPs mixed with various concentrations of NaCl solution
were investigated with MB as a probe molecule. Initially, FP embedded
with aggregated Ag NPs prepared using various concentrations of NaCl
(1 mM, 10 mM, 50 mM, 100 mM, 500 mM, and 1 M) was evaluated by collecting
the SERS signals of MB (5 μM), and the spectra are presented
in Figure 7a. It is
well-known that the intensity of the SERS signal is affected by the
plasmonic coupling of the metal interparticle and also depends on
the concentration of NaCl. While increasing the NaCl concentration
from 1 mM to 1 M range, the lowest EF (∼1.9 × 104) was observed at 1 mM NaCl, and this is expected because the NP
aggregation is the least. We could expect more hotspots with increasing
NaCl concentration but interestingly, the maximum EF (∼4.3
× 105) observed for 50 mM NaCl, an intermediate state
of aggregation. The decrease in the EF to ∼7 × 103 when the NaCl concentration increases, from 50 mM to 1 M,
might be because of the over-aggregation of NPs. The over-aggregated
Ag NPs would have affected the homogeneity of the substrate and played
a key role in achieving inferior SERS signal. Furthermore, at higher
concentrations, the over-aggregation probably decreased the number
of SERS-active hotspots. Figure 7b presents the EFs of the characteristic mode of MB
(1620 cm–1) with respect to the NaCl concentration.
The homogeneity of the SERS signal is a significant parameter in evaluating
the practicality of the SERS substrates. To test the reproducibility
of this optimized SERS substrate (FP + AgNPs + NaCl 50 mM), more than
10 spectra were acquired at randomly selected sites on the paper substrate
for MB (5 μM). All of the typical vibrational modes observed
in this study are in good agreement with the results reported previously.54 In certain cases, a small peak shift was noticed
and exhibited selective enhancement, and this could be because of
the orientation of molecules on the paper substrates. The results
of the calculated relative standard deviation (RSD) values for three
characteristic peaks of 449 cm–1 (skeletal deformation
of C–N–C), 1031 cm–1 (in-plane bending
of C–H), and 1620 cm–1 (ring stretching of
C–C) were 7.97, 13.08, and 11.22%, respectively. The single-peak
intensities and their RSD histograms are shown in Figure S12. From the observed results, we concluded that FP
soaked in Ag NPs (50 mM NaCl) demonstrated highly sensitive and reproducible
SERS response. It is to be noted that at higher concentrations (of
NaCl), there is a possibility of AgCl formation on the surface of
NPs, thereby affecting the efficiency of EM enhancement, and this
is reflected in the observed lower EFs at higher concentration (Figure 7b). However, detailed
studies will be essential to confirm this conjecture. Similarly, the
other highly efficient paper-based SERS substrates were fabricated
using gold NPs. The SERS response of MB was evaluated for the FP loaded
with the aggregated Au NPs achieved at various concentrations of NaCl. Figure 8a represents the
SERS spectra of MB (5 μM) detected using FP loaded with Au NPs
with different NaCl concentrations. The EF was calculated for the
1620 cm–1 mode and plotted as a function of concentration,
data of which are shown in Figure 8b. At low concentrations (1 and 10 mM), the obtained
EF was ∼1 × 104. While increasing the NaCl
concentration to 0.5 and 1 M, low SERS signal was observed and the
corresponding EF was ∼103. The maximum EF (∼7.6
× 104) was achieved at 50 mM NaCl, and low SERS signals
were observed when the NaCl concentration exceeded 50 mM and finally
reached 1 M. The high salt-concentration factor could easily lead
to the aggregation and precipitation of NPs on the FP. Thus, moderate
addition of NaCl concentration promotes the aggregation of NPs. Sufficient
amount of halide ions is required to achieve higher number of hotspots,
that is, less amount of chloride ions would not overcome the electrostatic
repulsion between the NPs and more amount induces excessive aggregation
or precipitation of the NPs.

from FP loaded with
Ag NPs at different concentrations of NaCl and (b) corresponding EF
at 1620 cm–1 as a function of concentration.

Figure 8 (a) SERS spectra of MB from Au NP-based FP with

of NaCl and (b) corresponding EF at 1620 cm–1 as
a function of concentration.

The reproducibility of SERS substrate (FP + Au NPs + NaCl
50 mM)
was examined by collecting the SERS spectra from more than 10 randomly
selected sites on paper substrate for MB of 5 μM. More ordered
and uniform Au NPs are observed in FESEM images, enabling high SERS
performance and lower RSD values. The calculated RSD values for the
prominent peaks of 446 and 1620 cm–1 were 5.78 and
7.37%, respectively (Figure S13). It can
be concluded that FP soaked in Au NPs with 50 mM NaCl demonstrated
strong SERS signal and relatively lower RSD values. The optimum condition
for the best SERS performance was observed at 50 mM NaCl concentration
for both Ag/Au NP paper-based substrates. The optimized Ag substrates
presented in this work depicted higher EFs (∼4.3 × 105) than the Au substrate EFs (∼7.6 × 104). It is worth mentioning that all of the SERS spectra were recorded
with a portable Raman spectrometer, useful for on-field applications.
Therefore, it is reasonable that increasing the excitation spot size
potentially ensures the possibility for rapid, on-site detection of
explosives. The sizes of the nanoaggregates on the paper are much
smaller compared to the Raman system laser beam size and, hence, the
SERS signals are an average over thousands of NPs aggregates.

SERS:
Detection of Dye (MB) Molecule
As a result of
great sensitivity and good reproducibility of aggregated Ag/Au NPs
(mixed with 50 mM NaCl), FPs with that particular concentration were
chosen as appropriate SERS substrates for detection of explosive/dye
molecules. A systematic study was performed to record the spectra
of MB (concentrations ranging from 5 μM to 5 nM) using aggregated
Ag NPs (mixed with 50 mM NaCl) incubated on FP, and the data are shown
in Figure 9a. A good
correlation was observed between the characteristic peak intensity
of 1620 cm–1, and the amount of MB was observed
(5 × 10–6 to 5 × 10–9 M). Figure 9b shows
the plot where y-axis corresponds to the Raman peak
intensity at 1620 cm–1 and X-axis
corresponds to the MB concentration (in log scale) and the R2 retrieved was ∼0.98. Thus, the intricate
fiber network with the decoration of aggregated plasmonic NPs enabled
the formation of high-density “hotspots”. A similar
study was performed using aggregated Au NPs (mixed with 50 mM of NaCl)
loaded on FP for MB (5 μM to 5 nM), and the data are depicted
in Figure S14a. The corresponding linear
calibration curves were constructed by monitoring the intensity of
the strong 1620 cm–1 spectral feature as a function
of analyte concentration, and the data are shown in Figure S14b. The log–log plot also exhibited a good
linear relationship with an R2 value of
0.997, demonstrating the potential application of paper-based SERS
substrates. The greater SERS sensitivity and highest EF of Ag NPs
(EF ≈ 3.4 × 107) compared to Au NPs (EF ≈
7.9 × 106) for MB 5 nM can be attributed to the superior
plasmonic properties and scattering cross sections. Real-time detection
of trace explosives is a major concern all over the world. Paper-based
SERS targets for explosive49 detection
combined with a portable Raman instrument could provide a low-cost
and fast on-site solution. The SERS performance of optimized FP SERS
substrate (aggregated Ag NPs at NaCl 50 mM) was examined with the
explosive molecules such as PA, DNT, and NTO (nitroaromatic explosives),
which exists in trace amounts in water and soil. DNT is environmentally
a more stable decomposition component of TNT, which was used in buried
landmines for military and terrorist activities. NTO has a similar
explosive performance to RDX, but it is an insensitive explosive.

NPs (50 mM NaCl).

SERS: Detection of Explosives
The SERS spectra of PA
at different concentrations, 5 mM, 50 μM, and 5 μM, were
recorded with optimized Ag paper substrate, and the data are shown
in Figure 10a. It
clearly shows the C–H bending mode at 821 cm–1 and NO2 symmetric stretching mode at 1344 cm–1 of PA.70 Even at a low concentration
(5 μM), the characteristic mode of 821 cm–1 was clearly visible. The EF was estimated to be ∼2.5 ×
104 which is comparable to that PA detection with Ag nanotriangle-loaded
FP.60 Similarly, the as-prepared Ag NPs
loaded paper substrate verified with the other explosive molecule
DNT. The SERS spectra of DNT (5 mM, 50 μM, and 1 μM) shown
in Figure 10b. The
characteristic peak of DNT 858 cm–1 was chosen to
calculate the EF and estimated as ∼1.9 × 104. We next examined with another explosive molecule NTO (1 mM, 100
μM, and 10 μM) shown in Figure 10c. The characteristic peaks of NTO 845,
1305, and 1383 cm–1 are assigned to NO2 symmetric stretching and deformation.71 The EF was estimated for NTO using Ag paper-based SERS substrate
is ∼2.1 × 104 for the 1383 cm–1 mode. The reproducibility measurements were also carried for NTO
(10 μM) by recording the SERS spectra at 16 different randomly
selected points on the optimized paper substrate, shown in Figure 11a. The Raman peak
shifts and assignments of all of the probe molecules are summarized

The SERS signal intensity at 1383
cm–1 mode from
different spots given an RSD of 9.78% revealing high spot to spot
reproducibility, which may result from the uniformity of hotspots.
The histogram of SERS intensity (1383 cm–1) is shown
in Figure 11b. Surprisingly,
no significant variations in the EF for PA (∼2.4 × 104), DNT (∼2 × 104), and NTO (∼2.1
× 104) were observed by employing the same optimized
Ag substrate (FP + Ag NPs + NaCl 50 mM), and the data are shown in Figure S15. Similarly, FP loaded with Au NPs
at NaCl 50 mM concentration substrate was also used to detect an explosive
DNT (10 μM), as shown in Figure S16. The observed EF was ∼1.5 × 104. The reproducibility
of the SERS signal was also verified, the data of which are shown
in Figure S17a with an RSD value of 15.58%
for the characteristic peak 855 cm–1 (illustrated
in Figure S17b). In the case of explosive
detection too, better EF was observed for Ag paper substrates than
Au substrates, and this could possibly be attributed to the UV broadening
[(Ag: 400–700 nm); (Au: 500–600 nm)] as well as the
higher mean size. Polavarapu et al.29 recently
demonstrated the effect of Raman excitation wavelength (532, 633,
and 785 nm), size, and shape of different NPs (Au NP, Au NR, and Ag
NP inks on paper) on SERS intensities and observed the superior EFs
for the substrate loaded with Ag NPs. Further detailed studies are
required to comment on the wavelength effect in the Au case. We strongly
feel that the wavelength effect in the Au case was overpowered by
the size effects and the number of hotspots.

In real-world scenarios,
the detection of multicomponent analyte
has a great value and there is urgent need for the development of
low-cost SERS substrates for such detection capabilities.72 Here, we present our initial results demonstrating
the capability and versatility of the fabricated paper substrate to
detect complex molecules (a mixture of PA and MB). The mixture of
dye and explosive molecule, consisting PA with 5 μM and MB with
50 nM concentrations in equal volumes, was prepared, and the SERS
spectrum was recorded using the paper substrates with Ag NPs. The
SERS signature of the explosive molecule is dominated by dye molecule
signature, as shown in Figure 12. However, we could clearly distinguish both (dye and
explosive molecule) the Raman peaks. The sensitivity of the low-cost
flexible paper substrate can be further improved by adopting different
shapes and sizes of the plasmonic NPs to achieve superior enhancements
toward the detection of various explosive mixtures or combination
of explosives and common substances. The EFs obtained in this study
are superior to some of the reported literature (summarized in Table 1), whereas some of
them demonstrated better performance than ours. Nevertheless, it is
to be noted that we have tested four different analyte molecules (including
three different explosives) and utilized a portable Raman spectrometer
for our studies providing ample evidence for the versatility of our
substrates. Additionally, the preparation methodology of our SERS
substrates is simple, robust, and green, unlike some of the reported
techniques, which are quite complicated and involve multiple steps.
Our future endeavor would be to optimize these SERS targets by incorporating
higher density of NPs, testing these with different sized (probably
smaller sized) NPs, and also test them with alloy NPs. Our earlier
studies have clearly advocated that alloy NPs have substantially improved
the SERS signals by an order of magnitude.54,70,73 We also plan to test different paper grades
for efficient loading of these NPs.

Conclusions
We
have successfully fabricated ecofriendly SERS substrate by using
low-cost FP as a base and is embedded with NPs that were also fabricated
by a green technique LAL. The common FP with aggregated Ag/Au NPs
provided a simple and robust approach for SERS substrate preparation.
Specifically, spherical Ag and Au NPs were loaded for an optimally
aggregated configuration to yield maximum signal enhancements in the
SERS measurements. Our results from detailed experiments presented
here indicate that the Ag/Au NPs with 50 mM NaCl concentration is
helpful for optimal SERS performance. From the result obtained, we
conclude the paper-based Ag substrate performance better than paper-based
Au substrate. The optimized active SERS paper substrate is helpful
for the detection of four adsorbed molecules (MB-5 nM, PA-5 μM,
DNT-1 μM, and NTO-10 μM) with high specificity, sensitivity,
and reproducibility. These concentrations in terms of mass represent
31.98 pg, 11.45 ng, 1.82 ng, and 13.06 ng, respectively. Overall,
we report here a simple, inexpensive technique for creating plasmonic
substrates that are readily integrated with portable spectrometer
for rapid SERS analysis. It offers to decrease the cost of analysis
using paper-based SERS targets and utilizing a portable Raman instrument,
which is portable to the point of diagnostics of interest. Furthermore,
the NPs produced by laser ablation are proven to be stable for long
periods of time.44 However, the stability
of these NPs when loaded in the FP is being investigated thoroughly.
We strongly believe that following further optimization studies, the
combination of low-cost and high-performance paper SERS devices will
be an ideal platform to enter on-site analysis, beyond the research
laboratories, for practical applications related to explosives detection.

Experimental
Details
Materials
Whatman Grade 1 FP with porosity 11 μM
and thickness 180 μM, silver (>99% pure) and gold targets
(>99%
pure) of thickness 1 mm, and NaCl compound (molar mass 58.44 g/mol)
was used for the preparation of different concentrations; methanol
(reagent grade), acetone (reagent grade), and MB (C16H18ClN3S·H2O) were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. The explosive molecules of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (PA,
C6H3N3O7), DNT (C7H6N2O4), and NTO (C2H2N4O3) were provided by HEMRL (Pune,
India) for SERS detection.

Synthesis of Ag/Au NPs
Ag/Au NPs
were synthesized by
LAL technique. Pure Ag and Au substrates were cleaned with acetone,
ethanol, and deionized water in an ultrasonic cleaner for 15 min to
remove any organic dopants present on the surface. The samples were
then ablated with a regenerative fs (Ti:sapphire) amplifier (∼50
fs, 800 nm, 1 kHz). The incident laser pulses were focused through
a planoconvex lens of focal length 100 mm onto the target surface
submerged in 10 mL of distilled water and placed in a glass beaker.
The focus was adjusted coarsely by using a low-power laser and later
finely by monitoring the cracking sound and the formation of the bright
plasma at the solid–liquid interface. The beaker was mounted
on a computer-controlled translational stage and scanned with 100
μm/s speed along X and Y directions,
so as to avoid repeated ablation at a single spot.45,73 The incident laser energy was adjusted to ∼500 μJ and
the ablation time was typically 40 min for both of the cases. When
the laser pulses are incident on the target surface, a series of processes
will undergo such as ejection of electrons, plasma plume formation,
and the creation of cavitation bubble within a short duration.54,74,75 Finally, the particles are generated
through the nucleation and growth process and suspended in liquid
as colloids. This is a “green” method used to produce
NPs in liquid without stabilizing molecules or ligands.45,76

Salt-Induced Aggregation of Synthesized Ag/Au NPs
Alkali
halides77 (NaF, NaCl, NaBr, NaI, KCl, KBr,
etc.), NaNO3, and K2SO4 boost the
aggregation in colloidal NPs.52,78 In the present work,
we have used NaCl as an aggregation agent. Furthermore, the concentration
of aggregation agent and ratio with NPs have been demonstrated to
play a vital role in the SERS intensities. In the present case, different
concentrations of NaCl (1 mM, 10 mM, 50 mM, 100 mM, 500 mM, and 1
M) mixed with 1:1 ratio of pure Ag/Au NPs. After addition of NaCl,
we noticed the change in the color of NPs [Figure S1 (left) shows the FP before soaking].

SERS Substrates Preparation
A Whatman Grade 1 FP composed
of almost (∼98%) α-cellulose, which is abundant in nature,
biodegradable, biocompatible, and recycled. The large fibers were
made of micro- and nanocellulose fibers interweaving with each other
and were normally porous in nature providing a large surface area
for localizing the plasmonic NPs. The penetration of NPs into the
paper depends on various factors such as the porosity (pore size),
thickness, and hydrophobicity.18 FP was
cut into small strips (1 cm2) and then soaked in the prepared
NP colloids. The association of the NPs on to the paper was obvious
because the color of NPs colloidal solution decreased and became colorless,
which means they essentially have got transferred to the FP. The color
of the colloidal NPs [Figure S1 (right)
after soaking FP] and the soaked FP loaded with Ag/Au NPs at different
concentrations of NaCl were also modified (Figure S2). The density of the NPs will change after aggregation (though
the number of total NPs remains the same in each case) and further
soaking the FP in these solutions (optimized concentration of NaCl)
have led to increased darkness in the observed color. At higher concentrations,
the loading of NPs was lower because of overaggregation. The time
of soaking was ∼30 min uniformly for all of the substrates
studied. However, this time also affects the loading of NPs and has
been studied extensively by Huang et al.,58 wherein they observed that soaking for 1 h procured excellent SERS
results. The absorption of NPs on a substrate will enhance the EM
field in sensing because of its ability achieved through the excitation
of LSPR. The soaked FP substrate was cut into four pieces (i.e., 2.5
mm2) and allowed to dry. Subsequently, 10 μL of the
volume of analyte was pipetted on to the paper. Schmucker et al.,
from their detailed studies, suggested that the NPs immobilized on
the paper remain stable under a variety of complex environmental conditions.79 A summary of literature reports on paper SERS
substrates fabrication techniques and their sensing applications are
presented in Table 1.
