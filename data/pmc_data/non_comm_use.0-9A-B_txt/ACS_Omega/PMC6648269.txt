Novel
unsaturated four-membered ring disilene, 3,3-dichloro-1,2,4,4-tetrakis[di-tert-butyl(methyl)silyl]-1Δ-1,2,3,4-trisilagermetene,
was synthesized by the ring expansion reaction of the three-membered
ring 1-disilagermirene with the silylene–NHC complex Cl2Si–IPr. The mechanism of the unexpected formation of
this compound was verified by high-level density functional theory
computations, which revealed nSi:(HOMO)–πSi=Si(LUMO)* as the dominant orbital interaction.

Introduction
Carbenes,
possessing both a lone pair and vacant p-orbital at the
divalent carbon center, are intrinsically ambiphilic.1 Likewise, silylenes, as silicon analogues of carbenes,
are also ambiphilic, manifesting dual-type reactivity: (1) electrophilic,
as electron pair acceptors, the acceptor orbital is a silicon 3p-orbital
[lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)] (Lewis acid reactivity)
and (2) nucleophilic, as electron pair donors, the donor orbital is
a silicon lone pair n-orbital [highest occupied molecular orbital
(HOMO)] (Lewis base reactivity) (Chart 1).2

Chart 1 Dual Reactivity of
Silylenes
The reactivity of silylenes
in each particular case is totally
governed by the substituents at the divalent silicon center: σ-electron-withdrawing
substituents (such as halogens) promote preferentially electrophilic
behavior of silylenes, whereas π-electron-donating groups (such
as amino-substituents) favor nucleophilic reactivity of silylenes.
Given their lone pairs, halogen substituents could alternatively be
considered as π-donors. However, our computations on the free
Cl2Si: do not support notable importance of such nCl → 3pSi interaction: (1) electron population
of the dichlorosilylene 3p-orbital is still low (0.12 e–) and (2) Si–Cl natural resonance theory bond order of 1.06
is indicative of a small extent of the double bonding.

Therefore,
it might be expected that the free dihalosilylenes,
including dichlorosilylene Cl2Si:, are primarily electrophilic
(like dichlorocarbene Cl2C:1b), thus undergoing reactions involving attack of the vacant p-orbital
of the silicon center by the Lewis basic reagent as the initial step
of the process. However, like dichlorocarbene, dichlorosilylene does
not exist as a stable compound, as it participates in a vast number
of chemical transformations as a reactive intermediate.3 The major breakthrough came in 2009, when Roesky
and co-workers reported the synthesis and crystal structure of the
isolable complex of dichlorosilylene with the N-heterocyclic carbene
(NHC), Cl2Si–IPr (IPr = 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-2H-imidazol-2-ylidene).4 In the
same year, the synthesis of dibromosilylene–NHC complex Br2Si–IPr was reported by Filippou and co-workers,5 and it is also relevant to mention here the remarkable
synthesis of metastable SiF2 and SiCl2 solutions
by Schnepf and co-workers.6

The germanium
analogue of dichlorosilylene, namely, dichlorogermylene
Cl2Ge:, also could not be isolated as a room temperature-stable
derivative because of its exceptionally high reactivity including
a polymerization process.7 However, n-donor
ligands can and do readily and effectively stabilize the low-coordinate
germanium center, and accordingly, a range of dichlorogermylene complexes
with such n-donor ligands was successfully prepared long ago.8 Among them, by far, the most common and readily
available is the complex of dichlorogermylene with 1,4-dioxane (diox),
[Cl2Ge–diox].9

Previously, we reported a rather unusual reaction between the [Cl2Ge–diox] complex with the heavier analogue of cyclopropene,
namely, the unsaturated three-membered ring 1-disilagermirene 1,10 which unexpectedly forms the
four-membered ring trans-1,2-dichloro-1,2,3,4-tetrakis[di-tert-butyl(methyl)silyl]-3Δ-1,2,3,4-disiladigermetene 2 (Scheme 1).11 Overall, this ring-expansion reaction
involved a tricky transformation of a Si=Si bond in the starting
1-disilagermirene 1 into a Ge=Ge bond in the final
disiladigermetene 2.

Scheme 1 Proposed Reaction Pathway for the
Formation of 2 (Adapted
from ref (9))
Expanding the applicability
range of such an attractive reaction,
we were prompted to explore the possibility of a similar reaction
of 1 with the source of dichlorosilylene, namely, Cl2Si–IPr. As the final product, we expected formation
of the compound similar to disiladigermetene 2, that
is, trisilagermetene 3 with a Si=Ge double bond
and two chlorine atoms at the skeletal sp3-Si atoms (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Proposed Synthesis
of 3
In this paper, we report on the results of these studies,
discussing
the actual structure of the product and proposing the mechanisms of
its formation, in comparison with the formation pathways for the previously
reported disiladigermetene 2.

Results and Discussion
In contrast to the fast reaction of disilagermirene 1 with Cl2Ge–diox, which quantitatively forms the
disiladigermetene 2 even at low temperature,11 reaction of 1 with Cl2Si–IPr required remarkably harsher conditions, namely, heating
in tetrahydrofuran (THF) at 70 °C for 34 h. The only product
isolated from the reaction mixture was 3,3-dichloro-1,2,4,4-tetrakis[di-tert-butyl(methyl)silyl]-1Δ-1,2,3,4-trisilagermetene 4, a structural isomer of the expected 3 (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Synthesis of 4
The product 4, isolated by glove-box column chromatography
as a yellow-orange solid, was formed along with free IPr12 and tBu2MeSiCl as the only identifiable side products. The side product tBu2MeSiCl was formed in tiny amounts
and identified by the comparison of its NMR and GC–MS spectroscopic
characteristics with those of the authentic sample (tBu2MeSiCl: colorless liquid, bp 60–61 °C/10
mm. 1H NMR (C6D6, δ, ppm):
0.19 (s, 3 H, CH3), 0.98 (s, 18 H, 2 tBu); 13C NMR (C6D6, δ,
ppm): −4.7 (CH3), 21.6 (2 C(CH3)3), 27.6 (2 C(CH3)3); 29Si NMR (C6D6, δ,
ppm): 37.9; GC–MS (m/z):
192 [M+], 157 [M+ – Cl], 135 [M+ – tBu]). Its formation can be
realized in terms of the elimination of tBu2MeSi-substituent from the starting 1,
taking place upon thermal reaction of the latter with Cl2Si–IPr playing a role of the chlorinating agent (the ability
of the latter complex to function as a chlorinating agent was previously
acknowledged: see ref (13)). This side reaction unavoidably proceeded upon heating, simultaneously
with the main reaction giving 4, resulting in the complex
mixture containing unidentifiable compounds along with tBu2MeSiCl. The constitution of 4 was established on the basis of its spectroscopic (NMR and HRMS)
data. Thus, in the 29Si NMR spectrum of 4,
there were two low-field resonances observed at +168.0 and +176.9
ppm, both in the region diagnostic for the four-membered ring cyclic
disilenes.14 This contradicts our initial
expectations of obtaining compound 3 with a Si=Ge
double bond, which requires observation of only one signal for the
sp2-Si atom, implying that rather than forming the cyclic
silagermene, the unsymmetrically substituted cyclic disilene with
a Si=Si bond was actually produced. This was finally confirmed
by X-ray crystallography of 4 (Figure 1). The four-membered ring is composed of
three silicon atoms and one germanium atom, featuring an endocyclic
Si2–Si3 double bond and two chlorine atoms attached to the
cyclic sp3-Si1 atom. The Ge1Si1Si2Si3-four-membered ring
is folded (folding angle is 24.2°, calculated value 18.3°),
and the length of the Si2–Si3 bond of 2.199(9) Å is typical
for the double bond in the cyclotetrasilenes (2.16–2.36 Å,14 calculated value 2.180 Å).

Figure 1 Crystal structure of 4 (ORTEP view, thermal ellipsoids
are given for Ge, Si, and Cl atoms at the 50% probability level, C
atoms are given as spheres, and H atoms are not shown. Part of the
molecule is positionally disordered, and only the major contribution
(79%) is shown).

As the structure of the
isolated product 4 is distinctly
different from that of the expected product 3, the mechanisms
of the formation of these two compounds are most likely different.
We probed this hypothesis with the high-level computations at the
M06/Def2TZVP15 level of theory.16

In the first step of the previously reported
disiladigermetene 2, we proposed initial addition of
the Cl2Ge: across
the Si=Si bond forming the intermediate chlorogermylene 5 (Scheme 1). Given the primarily electrophilic nature of dichlorogermylene,
one would expect initial interaction between the occupied π-orbital
of the Si=Si of disilagermirene 1 (HOMO) and the
vacant 4p-orbital of the Ge center of Cl2Ge–diox
(LUMO), finally resulting in the formation of 2 (Scheme 1). This was supported
by our computations, which showed that such a πSi=Si(HOMO) → 4pGe:(LUMO) orbital interaction is indeed facilitated
compared with the alternative nGe:(HOMO) → πSi=Si(LUMO)* interaction mode: ΔE(πSi=Si → 4pGe:) and ΔE(nGe: → πSi=Si*) are 43 and 151 kcal/mol, respectively. Likewise,
when the hypothetical free dichlorosilylene Cl2Si: was
calculated to react with disilagermirene 1, the first
step of the reaction primarily involved a πSi=Si(HOMO) → 3pSi:(LUMO) orbital interaction: ΔE(πSi=Si → 3pSi:) and ΔE(nSi: → πSi=Si*) are
52 and 143 kcal/mol, respectively. Such electrophilic behavior is
expected for the dichlorosilylene with its strongly electron-withdrawing
chlorine substituents. By contrast, when the NHC-complex of dichlorosilylene
Cl2Si–IPr was reacted with disilagermirene 1, the nSi:(HOMO)–πSi=Si(LUMO)* orbital interaction
became substantially more favorable because of the remarkable population
of the 3pSi:-orbital caused by the coordination of the
strongly σ-donating IPr-ligand [actually, the MO involving interaction
between the 3p-orbital of silicon and the lone pair orbital of NHC
ligand (HOMO – 22) is much lower in energy than the vacant
p-orbital (LUMO) in the free Cl2Si:]. Because of such unavailability
of the silicon 3p-orbital in the SiCl2–IPr complex
for πSi=Si → 3pSi: bonding
(which was the case of the free Cl2Si:, vide supra), the
primary nSi: → πSi=Si* interaction involves the lone pair n-orbital
on silicon, thus manifesting nucleophilic behavior of the dichlorosilylene
(Scheme 4). It should
be noted here that although predominantly nucleophilic behavior of
dichlorosilylene in the Cl2Si–IPr complex was not
previously unambiguously acknowledged, the Lewis basic reactivity
of the latter complex was documented in its reactions with Lewis acids,
such as boranes and transition metal complexes.13,17 The initial nucleophilic attack results in the generation of the
intermediate zwitter-ion 6, followed by the intramolecular
ring-expansion of the latter accompanied with the recovery of the
Si=Si double bond to form finally unsaturated four-membered
ring product 4 (Scheme 4).

Scheme 4 Proposed Reaction Pathway for the Formation of 4
Overall, the exceptional
electron-donating properties of the NHC
ligand strongly affects and alters the reactivity pattern of dichlorosilylene
in the Cl2Si–IPr complex: if free dichlorosilylene
Cl2Si: is primarily electrophilic, its NHC-complex Cl2Si–IPr is no longer electrophilic but rather nucleophilic
instead.

Conclusions
The unsaturated four-membered ring cyclic
disilene, namely, 3,3-dichloro-1,2,4,4-tetrakis[di-tert-butyl(methyl)silyl]-1Δ-1,2,3,4-trisilagermetene,
was unexpectedly formed upon the ring expansion reaction of the three-membered
ring 1-disilagermirene and the Cl2Si–IPr complex.
According to high-level density functional theory computations, the
most likely mechanistic scenario for the formation of the product
may involve nSi:(HOMO)–πSi=Si(LUMO)* as the dominant
orbital interaction.

Experimental Section
General Methods
All experimental manipulations were
performed using high-vacuum line techniques or in an argon atmosphere
of MBRAUN MB 150B-G glove box. All solvents were predried by conventional
methods and finally dried and degassed over a potassium mirror in
vacuum immediately prior to use. NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker
AV-400FT NMR spectrometer (1H NMR at 400.1 MHz; 13C NMR at 100.6 MHz; 29Si NMR at 79.5 MHz). High-resolution
mass spectra were measured on a Bruker Daltonics micrOTOF-TU mass
spectrometer with the atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI)
method. Starting 1-disilagermirene 1 was prepared according
to a previously published procedure.10

A
mixture of 1-disilagermirene 1 (387 mg, 0.51 mmol) and
Cl2Si–IPr (375 mg, 0.77 mmol) was placed in a reaction
tube with a magnetic stirring bar. Then, dry and degassed dioxygen-free
THF (4 mL) was introduced into the reaction tube by vacuum transfer,
and the reaction mixture was stirred at 70 °C for 34 h. THF was
removed under vacuum, and dry hexane was introduced. In the next step,
the free IPr was separated by glove-box column chromatography on silica
gel with hexane as eluent. Finally, the solvent and tBu2MeSiCl were removed under vacuum to give 4 as an orange-yellow solid (81 mg, 19%). mp 147–149
