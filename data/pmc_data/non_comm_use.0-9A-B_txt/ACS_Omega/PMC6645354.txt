Excitons
in parabolically confined planar quantum dots with a transverse
magnetic field have been studied in various model systems. The correlations
between e–h, e–e, and h–h have been incorporated
in terms of exact, simply elegant, and absolutely terminating finite
summed Lauricella functions which eliminate the secular divergence
problem and pave way for a comprehensive understanding of certain
exotic phenomena of various two-dimensional regular and irregular
quantum dots. A simple yet highly accurate and exact variational wave
function in terms of Whittaker-M function extensible
to multiexcitonic systems has been propounded. We have also presented
a formulation extending the size of the systems to triexcitonic (e–e–h/e–h–h),
biexcitonic (e–h–e–h), and multiexcitonic (“N”
e–h pair) planar dots by mono-, di-, quadru-, and octopole
expansions. As a benchmark, we have examined the energy spectra, level-spacing
statistics, heat capacities (Cv at 1 K),
and magnetization (T ≈ 0–1 K) of He/SiO2/BN/GaAs model systems for different lateral confinements,
magnetic fields, mass ratios of e–h, and dielectric constants
(ϵ).

Introduction
Quantum dots (QDs) formulate a very fundamental
area of interest
in mesoscopic physics because of their exotic applications in electronic
and optoelectronic technologies such as new-generation QD lasers,
quantum information processing etc.1−7 In two-dimensionally confined systems such as graphene or boron
nitride (BN), the unusual transport phenomena yield various applications
such as composite materials, electric batteries, field emitters, solid-state
gas sensors etc.8 Often referred to as
“artificial atoms”, the unique features of these artificially
simulated structures arise from the controlled modification of their
density of states achieved by reducing the dimensions through confinement
from 3-D to zero-dimension. Moreover, exciton formation upon the binding
of an electron and a hole, electron–phonon, and e–e
interactions in QDs has opened another frontier of as yet elusive
phenomena like fractional quantum Hall effect, Meissner effect, Josephson
effect, Kondo effect, and Coulomb blockade etc.9−13 Unlike composite fermions, the response of excitons
to gate voltage (lateral confinement) and magnetic field (transverse
confinement) is susceptible to change depending upon the individual
masses of electrons and holes. Eventually, the inclusion of attractive
or scattering correlations existing between e–h, e–e,
and h–h pairs further shuffles bound states to a greater extent,
making the Hamiltonian nontrivial. A gamut of theoretical and experimental
investigations into such systems has revealed and put the interplay
between the quantum confinement, magnetic field, and the Coulomb correlations
at the focal point of scientific curiosity.14−27 In the present work, we have examined a strongly correlated excitonic
Hamiltonian of a 2-D QD with a due cyclotron field where the Coulomb
interaction has been treated analytically.18−21 The response of excitonic systems
with varying e–h mass ratios in the presence of a magnetic
field is also undertaken, along with the zero and nonzero confining
potential in different dielectric media. We have extended e–h
correlations by invoking multipole expansion to multiexcitonic systems
such as biexciton and triexciton which have gravitated current research
areas.22 In the multiexcitonic systems,
the regime where Coulomb correlations and magnetic field-induced contributions
to energy are comparable, a peculiar pattern is observed for different
effective masses, indicating that the Born–Oppenheimer approximation
holds true for excitons with heavy holes. We have applied the formalism
to the model systems from low dielectric to high dielectric media
like He/SiO2/BN/GaAs and presented the cumulative effects
of the competing factors on the energy-level spectra, heat capacities
(Cv), and magnetization ().

Theoretical Methods
With the canonical momenta of e–h proposed by Chakraborty
et al.,14,15 the spin-free Hamiltonian of a 2-D multiexciton
QD confined by a harmonic potential (ω0,K) of both regular and irregular anisotropic superlattices/QDs
(lattice point “”) with
transverse magnetic field
(ωc) and dielectric constant ϵ (in au) can
be described as 1  where mi and ei are the
mass and the charge in au on the i-th charge carrier
(either an electron or a hole depending on the composition of the
multiexciton system). Anisotropy often emerges in the excitonic QD
systems as a consequence of irregular geometry, electronegativity
difference between constituent atoms, and/or applied gate voltage.
This anisotropy is well accounted for and incorporated in different
confinements (ω0,K(s)) around lattice points “”, which
contains information about
the detailed geometry of superlattices/QDs. As the charge carriers
(electron/hole) orbit around a unique origin, both the diagonal and
off-diagonal Coulomb/exchange interactions are enhanced more for such
simple systems; that is, it is preferred to introduce anisotropy of
different orders to make the Hamiltonian more holistic. Although the
hexagonal honeycomb structure of graphene offers the best possible
template of isotropicity in the two-dimensional configuration, transition
of each individual charge carrier (e/h) bearing an effective mass
to massless Dirac fermions occurs at Dirac points which ultimately
yields a zero-band gap in graphene, and the system demands for a Dirac-relativistic
treatment, which is beyond the scope of this paper, as the current
discussion is wholly dedicated to the treatment of many body quantum
systems in a generic nonrelativistic regime. Apart from graphene,
BN (analogue of graphene) and TMDCs (transition-metal dichalcogenides)
also offer as an important class of 2-D-confined excitonic systems.
Both BN and TMDCs represent a class of anisotropic layer compounds
which are characterized by strong in-plane bonding and weak out-of-plane
interactions. However, the degree of anisotropy in TMDCs is more acute
than in BN. The effective masses of charge carriers and the dielectric
constant of TMDCs are dependent on the crystal direction and the number
of layers, respectively, making them extremely anisotropic. The values
of effective masses of charge carriers (electron/hole) differ greatly
for different crystal directions even in the in-plane configuration.
TMDCs include a whole array of different compounds like MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, WSe2, etc, all of
which are extremely anisotropic and have crystal lattice direction-dependent
properties like anisotropic effective mass and a layer-dependent dielectric
constant. Although BN also possesses anisotropy, the effective mass
of charge carriers is isotropic, that is, not dependent on layer numbers
or lattice directions, and in the present study, BN has been treated
as an isotropic 2-D-confined system (we = wh). This is the first step in treating
anisotropy, a complete description of which calls for a separate paper
in itself. Therefore, in the current paper, we limit our discussion
to isotropic nonrelativistic 2-D-confined excitonic systems.

Exciton Systems
For a 2-D exciton under a unique origin,
that is, (R⃗K=1 = 0⃗), the Hamiltonian appears as21 2  

Introduction of relative and center-of-mass

the full Hamiltonian to 3   4  where , , and . In atomic units, ℏ = e = c = 1/4πϵ0 = 1, Hr0 can be written as 5  where ωc_r = eB/c and . The Hamiltonian for the system can be
segregated into two parts, namely, unperturbed (Hr0 + HR0) and perturbed (). The ansatz wave function
is chosen to
be , m = 0, ±1, ±2,
..., where u(r) is a radial part
and eimθ is the angular part. Eigenvalues
of Hr0 and HR0 are En,m0 and , respectively. Solving for Hr0ξn,m(r,θ)
= En,m0ξn,m(r,θ) yields the
following radial equation 6  

On substituting x = Ωrr2 with u(r) ⇒ U(x), the above equation
transforms as 7  

Transformation U(x) = x–1/4M(x) leads to 8  where M(x) is Whittaker-M function and . Comparison of the above equation
with
the self-adjoint differential equation of the Whittaker-M function yields the corresponding eigenvalue as , and the normalized eigenfunction
is given
by ,

eigensolutions of HR0 can be evaluated in a similar manner which
furnishes the corresponding eigenvalue as . Integrals of the Coulomb interaction between
the e–h pair can be expressed as ( and  conserved) 9

Thus, I2 becomes 19  

Multiexciton Systems
A lot of investigative/experimental
studies into the multiexcitonic systems such as bi- and triexcitons
have been done. The characteristic which makes the multiexcitonic
systems like bi- and triexcitons very interesting and unique is the
presence of aggravated Coulombic/exchange correlations with respect
to applied gate voltage and magnetic field. However, the exact solution
to the Coulomb/exchange correlation beyond one electron has yet not
been available for a long time. The discussion about multiexcitonic
systems has been provided as a stepping stone to extend the current
methodology beyond an e–h pair. The current formalism, in any
way, is not limited to be applicable to only the model systems discussed
here. However, it is a universal approach applicable with equal ease
to any system of interest within the nonrelativistic 2-D-confined
regime. In the four model systems (He, SiO2, BN, and GaAs)
under study, the different values of dielectric constant (ϵ)
lead to different expressions of the relative strength of Coulombic/exchange
correlations. As the Coulomb correlation scales to a factor of 1/ϵ,
different signatures for energy emerge, from the study of which a
more concise evaluation of the field parameters required to fabricate
various nanoscale devices and technological applications can be estimated.
Also, the stabilization introduced in the systems on account of Coulomb/exchange
correlations is a major factor that determines the overall stability
and lifetime of the multiexcitonic systems, where an exciton is the
fundamental building block.

Isotropic Multiexcitonic Systems
For a 2-D multiexciton
under a unique origin (R⃗K=1 = 0⃗), that is, the isotropic system, the Hamiltonian
appears as21    where . mi and ei denote
the mass and the charge in au on the i-th charge
carrier (either an electron or a hole as specified by the composition
of the multiexciton system under consideration). The correlation term
(Hij) can be expanded
using the well-known multipole expansion.31 The above Hamiltonian of an isotropic multiexciton system can be
solved by invoking the well-known multipole expansion31 for handling each term of Coulomb interactions wherein  is expanded
in the neighborhood of  20  Here, V is the total
Coulomb
correlations between all i-th and j-th charge carriers, with 21   22   23  

Because the methodology
proposed by
us deals with the generic co-ordinates of all the individual charge
carriers, formation of Slater determinants will automatically reveal
that the Pauli exclusion principle is obeyed.

Triexciton (e–e–h/e–h–h)
For the case of a 2-D triexciton, the Hamiltonian is given by 24  

The Coulomb correlation is
solved by
invoking a multipole expansion method  where 25   26   27  

The variational principle is employed
for solving the Coulomb correlation
in the monopole term [eq 25] using the standard integral [eq 10]. The term accounting for the dipole [eq 26] with p = 1 can be expressed as 28  into which the insertion of the discretized
closure relation ∑k=0∞|ξk⟩⟨ξk| facilitates
the evaluation of dipole-type and Coulomb-type integrals using eq 10 recursively.32 The quadrupole factor [eq 27] can be solved by adopting a similar approach.

Biexciton (e–h–e–h)
The Hamiltonian
of a biexciton in 2-D QDs is represented as 29  

The case of a biexciton
is also handled in a similar way to a triexciton. For the case of
a biexciton, the Coulomb correlation expanded in multipole series
arises as  where 30   31   32  

The biexcitonic
dipole term is given by 33  which
can be solved by inserting a discretized
closure relation as done in the case of the triexciton.

Result
and Discussion
A product basis span of 55 × 36 = 1980
is considered for carrying
out diagonalization. The four model systems, that is, He, SiO2, BN, and GaAs have been chosen to study a whole spectrum
of dielectric constants. These systems encompass the window of the
dielectric from 1.0 to 12.35, thereby giving a comprehensive reflection
of the effect of changing the dielectric on the Coulomb correlations
as the later scale to a factor of 1/ϵ. A systemic study of the
interplay of ωe = ωh = ωo (zero and nonzero), that is, isotropic ambience, ωc, ϵ, e–h/e–e/h–h interactions, me, and mh on the
energy-level diagram has been done. A change in ωo, that is, an increase or decrease in ωo indicates
a change in the size of the QD which in turn points toward a decrease
or increase, respectively, in interactions among the charge carriers.
Level-spacing statistics, magnetization (T ≈
1 K), and Cv are employed for investigating
the rearrangement of states where a transverse magnetic field modifies
overall confinement frequency (hybrid magnetoelectric confinement
frequency, Ωr). Inclusion of  does not cause
appreciable crossings and
anticrossings among lower-bound states for interacting systems. The
inferences from the results indicate that the lower states do not
show much of mixing with the onset of magnetic field [Figures 1–4] because both the Coulomb
and the exchange integrals stabilize the system. The relative extent
of stabilization depends on the strength of both applied ωo and ωc. In the regime of low magnetic field,
the Coulomb interaction dominates [Figures 1b,c, 2b,c, 3b,c, and 4b,c] whereas in
the high-magnetic regime, the stabilization due to the exchange interaction
additionally drives the system toward Landau levels. This tendency
is further strengthened at stronger confinement [Figures 1e,f, 2e,f, 3e,f, and 4e,f].
In the regime of moderate magnetic field, a glance at the elements
of correlation matrices indicates that the Coulomb interaction (diagonal
matrix elements) is a stronger stabilizing force than the exchange
integral (off-diagonal matrix elements) [Table 1] which can be approximated for states with
a higher angular momentum (m) as 34

The e–h/e–e/h–h
interactions decrease with
increasing angular momentum (|m|) which limits to  for larger m, virtually
mapping onto Laughlin’s results and existing literature at
high “ωc”.1,12,13,33−40 An interesting revelation that comes to the fore from the study
of all the systems (He, SiO2, BN, and GaAs) of varying
dielectric constants at zero confinement and approximately zero ωc is that even in presence of the Coulomb interaction, the
ground state exhibits extremely high degeneracy which is lifted with
the onset of magnetic field [Figure 1(g–i)–4(g–i)].
Such splitting of energy levels by ωc is reminiscent
of the Zeeman effect in hydrogenic systems. For a particular system,
the energy spectrum does not change appreciably on moving from α
= 10.0 to 100.0, which validates the Born–Oppenheimer approximation.

Role of
Effective Mass (me) and
Dielectric Constant (ϵ)
The spectra of states for a
variety of materials such as He, SiO2, BN, and GaAs with me = 1.0, 0.42, 0.7, and 0.07 au and ϵ
= 1.0, 3.9, 7.1, and 12.35, respectively, are examined as a function
of ωc with zero (ωo = 0.0 au) and
nonzero confinement (ω0 = 0.002 and 0.0002 au). To
a first approximation, the energy of the interacting systems as a
function of high cyclotron frequency, me, and hybrid magnetoelectric confinement frequency (Ωr) can be represented as 35  

For noninteracting
systems with nonzero
confinement (ωo = 0.002 and 0.0002 au), there is
no appreciable change in the energy spectra with change in me [Figures 1(a,d)–4(a,d)]. For interacting
systems with nonzero confinement (ωo = 0.002 and
0.0002 au), two kinds of states arise which can be classified into
hydrogenic states (HS) and harmonic oscillator/Gaussian states (GS).
These states are stabilized to different extents depending on the
ratio of meωo/ωc (≈0.034 au), leading to the emergence of bunch states
which favor the formation of excitons from Fermi-sea [Figures 1(b,c,e,f)–4(b,c,e,f)]. With the onset of magnetic field, the
previously potent stabilizing Coulomb interaction is overpowered by
stabilization due to magnetic field on moving from α = 1.0 to
10.0 [Figures 1(b,c,e,f)–4(b,c,e,f)]. The details of the aforementioned trends
will be discussed subsequently.

Exciton in a He QD (me = 1.0 au,
ϵ = 1.0)
An exciton in a He QD represents a strongly
correlated system, as a dielectric constant of 1.0 implies that the
separation between charge carriers is reduced resulting in increased
Coulombic (exchange) interactions, a direct evidence of which is furnished
by the energy-level diagrams of excitons in the He QD at different
ωo. Even at different confinement frequencies and
magnetic fields, the resulting bound states for the excitonic system
in the He QD predominantly exhibit a hydrogenic character of the state.
A change in the confinement frequency changes the spatial extent/size
of the QD. Upon increasing ωo from 0.0002 to 0.002
au, the size of the QD confining the same charge (carrying the same
amount of charge) is reduced. A reduction in the size also points
toward an increased amount of interactions among charge carriers which
is also proved to be the case by the pattern of energy in energy-level
spectra. The study of energy-level spectra for an exciton in the He
QD has been carried out at different values of α. α being
the ratio of effective mass of hole to electron signifies whether
the exciton is a heavy hole or a light hole. An increase in α
indicates a stronger attractive interaction contributing to the stability
of the system. This can also be understood by consulting the energy-level
spectra for a fixed ωo at different values of α.
For a better understanding of the energy-level spectra, the terms
contributing to the total energy of the system must be cautiously
borne in mind: . For the terms
containing Ωr and ωc_r, an increase
in their respective values
contributes positively toward the stabilization of the system. For
a noninteracting exciton of the 2-D He system, the ground state energy
increases with the increasing magnetic field for ωo = 0.0002 and 0.002 au, respectively, typical of a Fock–Darwin
spectrum [Figure 1a,d].
For the interacting system at a weaker field strength, the Coulomb
(exchange) correlation is the major stabilizing force. The magnetic
field facilitates stabilization both through Coulomb and exchange
correlations, but the magnitude of stabilization induced by the exchange
correlation exceeds that of Coulomb, leading to faster fall in energy
for HS [Figure 1b,c,e,f].
The energy of all states is lowered on increasing α from 1.0
to 10.0, but a further increase in α = 100.0 seems to cause
no significant change in energy spectra. In case of α = 1.0,
the contribution due to  term is negated; hence, the fall
of energy
is not as steep as compared with α = 10.0 and 100.0. In case
of zero confinement (ω0 = 0.0 au), a striking feature
that emerges from the energy-level spectra [Figure 1g–i] is the existence of negative-bound
states with a steep fall in the stabilization energy even at weaker
magnetic field. This feature reveals a very important point regarding
excitons in 2-D QDs, which is that even when the confinement frequency
is made almost zero, the system does not fly off, rather, the attractive
interactions among the charge carriers lead to the generation of a
potential providing stability for the existence of HS. A value of
ωo implies that the confining potential, that is,
the gate voltage applied across the dot, has been removed, but because
of the presence of a relatively weak (when compared to cases with
nonzero ωo) magnetic field, the Coulombic correlations
among charge carriers lead to the formation of hydrogenic-bound states.
There is, however, not much significant change in the signature of
energy-level spectra on increasing α (10.0 to 100.0).

Exciton
in the SiO2 QD (me = 0.42 au,
ϵ = 3.9)
For a noninteracting exciton
in the SiO2 system, the ground state energy increases with
the increase in the magnetic field similar to He with delayed crossing
and anticrossing [Figure 2a,d]. In interacting SiO2 excitonic systems, the
stabilization due to the Coulomb (exchange) interaction induced on
account of ωo and/or ωc exhibits
analogous behavior to He except for the particular amounts of stabilization
brought into picture by effective mass through the  factor [Figure 2b,c,e,f]. The effect of increased ϵ
in case of the exciton in SiO2 can be immediately gauged
from the decrease in the energy gap between few lowest states and
the higher excited states. The relative energy gap between the HS
and the GS is less [Figure 2b,c] as compared to He at lower confinement (ωo = 0.0002 au) which further reduces, leading to an overlap between
the states if the confinement of the system is raised to ωo = 0.002 au [Figure 2e,f]. For zero confinement, only few HS appear to be forming
negative-bound states, whereas the excited states do not exhibit the
same which can be attributed to a higher dielectric constant [Figure 2g–i].

Exciton
in the BN QD (me = 0.7 au,
ϵ = 7.1)
In case of a noninteracting BN excitonic system,
the ground state energy increases with rapid crossing and anticrossing
upon raising the magnetic field, and the stabilization due to  is 0.6 times that of SiO2 on
account of higher effective mass [Figure 3a,d]. The energy gap between ground and higher
excited states is further quenched [Figure 3b,e] in interacting systems at lower confinement
(ωo = 0.0002 au). At high confinement (ωo = 0.002 au), shuffling of the HS and the GS leading to crossing
and anticrossing is further intensified with both increasing magnetic
field and α (1.0 to 10.0) [Figure 3c,f]. However, no significant change in the
spectra is observed upon increasing α from 10.0 to 100.0. At
zero confinement, apart from the fewer lowest states, all excited
states increase in energy with increasing magnetic field and α
[Figure 3g–i].

Exciton in the GaAs QD (me = 0.07
au, ϵ = 12.35)
For a noninteracting excitonic system
in the GaAs QD, the ground state energy increases upon raising the
magnetic field while exhibiting quick crossing and anticrossing among
levels. The stabilization due to  is enhanced 10 and 6 times that
of BN and
SiO2, respectively, on account of poor effective mass [Figure 4a,d]. In case of
interacting systems, the effective mass leads to quick crossings and
anticrossings of states with increasing magnetic field. The cumulative
effect of both an exceptionally high dielectric and poor effective
mass quenches the energy gap, leading to an overlap of ground and
other excited states even at lower confinement (ωo = 0.0002 au) [Figure 4b,c,e,f]. The significant crossings and anticrossings exhibited in
case of ωo = 0.0002 and 0.002 au are also enhanced
with increasing α from 1.0 to 10.0 [Figure 4 c,f]. However, no appreciable change is
observed on moving α from 10.0 to 100.0. At zero confinement
(ωo = 0.0 au), the number of HS becomes less while
the number of GS increases in comparison to He, SiO2 and
BN excitonic systems [Figure 4g–i]. The profound effect of extremely high ϵ
is reflected by these GS which indicate that for GaAs, the Coulombic
correlations are substantially muted because of the high dielectric
constant in comparison to the He QD system. Relative stabilization
of all HS including the ground state also becomes negligible.

Level-Spacing Statistics
For an exciton in the 2-D
harmonic dot with a due cyclotron frequency to investigate the degree
of disorder in the energy-level spectrum, level-spacing statistics
were studied for all systems with varying dielectric constants, that
is, He, SiO2, BN, and GaAs at ωo = 0.0,
0.0002, and 0.002 au. Uncorrelated levels give rise to exponential
or Poisson distribution (P(s) ≈
βe–σs) as stated in
accepted literature.41−43 The level statistics remain unchanged for varying
confinement frequencies for different systems. In spite of crossings
and anticrossings between levels, the level repulsions are not significant
enough to give rise to phase transitions [Figure 5a–d]. We have presented here the level-spacing
statistics for all systems, that is, He, SiO2, BN, and
GaAs at a particular ωo = 0.002 au and α =
1.0; the signature is not altered significantly on changing the confinement
frequency and hence to keep matters simple, we have refrained from
giving all graphs. The level-spacing statistics also do not change
much with changing α from 1.0 to 10.0, 100.0, and 1000.0.

field (ωc) for He (ϵ = 1.0), SiO2 (ϵ = 3.9), BN (ϵ = 7.1), and GaAs (ϵ = 12.35)

Thermodynamic Properties
From the energy-level spectra
and the level-spacing statistics, thermodynamic quantities like specific
heat (Cv) and magnetization () have been
evaluated. These thermodynamic
properties implicitly carry the qualitative information regarding
the material properties. The present work on Cv and  is based
on two-states problem, that is,
the investigation of interaction among the ground and the first excited
states in the limit of low temperature. Thus, specific heat and magnetization
directly reflect the response of the system as a function of transverse
magnetic field. The equations relating the energy and thermodynamic
properties are mentioned in the subsequent sections.

Heat Capacity
(Cv)
From
the energy-level spectra values and the level-spacing statistics,
thermodynamic quantities like specific heat (Cv) and magnetization () have been
evaluated. These thermodynamic
properties implicitly carry the qualitative information regarding
the material properties. The equations relating the energy and the
thermodynamic properties are mentioned below. For an exciton in a
2-D QD at ω0 = 0.0, 0.002, and 0.00002 au for systems
with varying dielectric constants viz. He (ϵ = 1.0), SiO2 (ϵ = 3.9), BN (ϵ = 7.1), and GaAs (ϵ =
12.35), heat capacities (Cv) are examined
as a function of ωc at T ≈
1 K approximated for HS and GS by the following relation44,45 36  where
ε = ΔE1/2kBT and ΔE1 = (E1 – E0). As indicated by the lack of level repulsions
in the level-spacing statistics, Cv is
independent of ωc for all systems [Figure 6], which is substantiated by
the fact that there is no mixing of ground HS with the other GS. Only
one heat capacity versus ωc graph is shown for representational
purposes.

(ωc) for BN (ϵ = 7.1) at ω0 = 0.002 au (T = 1 K), [a]. Magnetization () vs magnetic
field (ωc) for BN (ϵ = 7.1) at ω0 = 0.002 au (T = 1 K), [b].

Magnetization ()
For noninteractive and interactive
systems at ω0 = 0.0, 0.002, and 0.00002 au at low
temperature limit (T ≈ (0–1) K), magnetization
of ground hydrogenic and first excited GS is evaluated using the following
form44 37   38  where y = 1/(1 + e–ε1), ε1 = ΔE1/kBT, ΔE1 = (E1 – E0),
and E is the energy at
specific ωc. Magnetization shows exponential decay
for all systems considered in the present study at different confinement
frequencies.

Exciton, Triexciton, and Biexciton in the
He QD (me = 1.0 au, ϵ = 1.0) and
the GaAs QD (me = 0.07 au, ϵ = 12.35)
As the number of
interactions among the charge carriers on moving from exciton to biexciton
increases, it leads to a corresponding increase in the energy of the
system. Additional stabilization is introduced in the system because
of enhanced exchange correlations. The He QD represents the lower
end of the dielectric window for which we have conducted the study
in excitonic systems. A multiexcitonic system in the He QD represents
a strongly correlated system as ϵ = 1.0. The various terms that
contribute to energy along with the Coulomb (exchange) correlations
are   At lower confinement,
that is, ωo = 0.0002 au and α = 1.0, the energy
gap between the
few lowest and the higher excited states begins to quench as one moves
from exciton and triexciton to biexciton [Figures 7 and 8a,b]. A highly
appreciable energy gap between HS and GS in case of an exciton is
quenched significantly for a triexciton which is further quenched,
leading to an overlap of HS and GS in the biexciton. The effect of
raising α from 1.0 to 10.0 results in an addition to the energy
due to nonzero . The
energy increases on increasing the
confinement frequency ωo from 0.0002 to 0.002 au
as expected, as the contribution due to both  is increased
[Figures 7 and 8c,d]. The major
stabilizing force that leads to the stabilization of HS is the attractive
Coulombic interaction. The energy of the states increases with the
increase in magnetic field. A feature that emerges from scanning across
the exciton, triexciton, and biexciton He QD is that the energy states
do not exhibit crossings and anticrossings among different levels
[Figures 7 and 8a–d]. The extent of stabilization due to
exchange correlations differs from GS to HS. For biexcitons, in case
of lower dielectric QDs, for example, He, GS are stabilized more than
HS which is evident from acute and exaggerated crossings/anticrossings
among both bound states, whereas for triexcitons, a shallow band gap
is observed. The trend is found to be similar in the case of higher
dielectric QDs (GaAs) but the band gap for the triexciton and mixing
of states for the biexciton are less pronounced [Figures 9 and 10a,–d].

(c,d—interactive system for ωo = 0.002 au

Conclusions
In case of excitonic systems of a wide
variety of materials with
varying dielectric constants, a striking feature that has emerged
from this study is that the unique ground state is rarely involved
in crossings and anticrossings. Also, the number of lower bunching
states along with the ground state is found to be 11 which is invariant
for all systems (He, SiO2, BN, and GaAs) in the given chosen
basis. For all the systems considered in the present study at ωo = 0.0 au, the density of states is analogous to HS. Also,
such hydrogenic-bound states increase in number with increasing α.
As the dielectric constant of the system is increased, the states
show a transformation from HS to GS; this observation is strengthened
by the fact that on muting the oscillatory transverse field, the system
collapses into a hydrogenic system. In case of He with ϵ = 1.0,
the states at ωo = 0.0 au resemble purely HS, whereas
at the other end, in case of GaAs with ϵ = 12.35, the states
have more of GS character than HS. The impact of the Coulombic interaction
on the electronic structure of excitonic QDs confined in a harmonic
potential with transverse magnetic field is astonishing. The competitive
behavior of the hybrid magnetoelectric confinement frequency (ΩR), ωc, ϵ, me, and mh with each other leads to a criss-cross
pattern of the energy spectrum. Moreover, e–h/e–e/h–h
interactions are higher for states having lower angular momentum (m). Level-spacing statistics, specific heat (T ≈ 1 K), and magnetization (T ≈ (0–1)
K) also give clear affirmation of it. It is also observed that under
limiting case of high angular momentum, the Coulomb correlation employed
in our methodology virtually maps onto Laughlin’s speculations.
