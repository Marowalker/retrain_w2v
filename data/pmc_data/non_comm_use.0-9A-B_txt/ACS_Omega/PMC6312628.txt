Prompt
and repeated assessments of tumor sensitivity to available
therapeutics could reduce patient morbidity and mortality by quickly
identifying therapeutic resistance and optimizing treatment regimens.
Analysis of changes in cancer cell biomass has shown promise in assessing
drug sensitivity and fulfilling these requirements. However, a major
limitation of previous studies in solid tumors, which comprise 90%
of cancers, is the use of cancer cell lines rather than freshly isolated
tumor material. As a result, existing biomass protocols are not obviously
extensible to real patient tumors owing to potential artifacts that
would be generated by the removal of cells from their microenvironment
and the deleterious effects of excision and purification. In this
present work, we show that simple excision of human triple-negative
breast cancer (TNBC) tumors growing in immunodeficient mouse, patient-derived
xenograft (PDX) models, followed by enzymatic disaggregation into
single cell suspension, is enabling for rapid and accurate biomass
accumulation-based predictions of in vivo sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic
drug carboplatin. We successfully correlate in vitro biomass results
with in vivo treatment results in three TNBC PDX models that have
differential sensitivity to this drug. With a maximum turnaround time
of 40 h from tumor excision to useable results and a fully-automated
analysis pipeline, the assay described here has significant potential
for translation to clinical practice.

==== Body
Introduction
An enhanced understanding
of cancer’s molecular underpinnings
has enabled the introduction of more personalized treatments informed
by rigorous histologic subtyping and mutation or biomarker analysis.
However, because biomarkers are genetic or epigenetic changes identified
by large scale patient studies, interpatient and intrapatient tumor
heterogeneity often undermine the efficacy of biomarker-indicated
first line therapy regimens.1,2 This heterogeneity reduces
efficacy and may lead to the rapid development of drug resistance.
For example, in ER+ and PR– breast cancers, only 40% of patients
respond to biomarker-indicated anti-hormonal therapy.3 Additionally, a majority of cancers including triple-negative
breast cancer (TNBC) still lack therapy response predictive biomarkers
to guide drug selection. Taken together, the lack of reliable markers
and the heterogeneity in drug responsiveness between cancers with
the same biomarkers underscore the need for a personalized clinical
assay that can predict therapy response. As a result, much interest
has focused on assays that measure a functional outcome after drug
treatment, such as ATP production or cell death. These assays hold
promise by combining genetic, epigenetic, and other signals or activities
into a single quantifiable output.

Current methods of assessing
in vitro tumor drug responses include
the gold standard CellTiter-Glo or luciferase-based assays, which
quantify ATP levels after several days of exposure to a specific therapeutic.4,5 This method has seen increased adoption due to recent improvements
in tumoroid culture methodologies, which excel at expanding ex vivo
tissue samples.6,7 Such improvements have made feasible
the idea that each patient might one day have their own tumoroid grown
and tested against a battery of potential therapies. This would be
analogous to antibiotic susceptibility testing for patients with urinary
tract infections. However, many challenges remain, including low success
rates and high costs. In some cancer types, only 20% of organoid cultures
are successful.8 Furthermore, assessing
drug responses with endpoint assays such as CellTiter-Glo requires
long turnaround times which further increases costs and necessitates
bulk averaging of signals from the cancer cells. Ideally, a method
for assessing drug sensitivity in solid tumors would not require long
term culture, have fast turnaround times, and maintain single-cell
sensitivity important for the identification of minority resistant
cells in otherwise drug-sensitive tumors.

Analysis of changes
in cancer cell biomass has shown promise in
rapidly assessing drug sensitivity and fulfilling these requirements.9−12 Of particular interest are quantitative phase imaging techniques,
such as interference microscopy, digital holography, and related phase-retrieval
methods, which are very flexible, easily adapted to standard cell
culture Labware, and require no external labeling.

In cell line
models of breast cancer13 and melanoma,14 loss in cellular biomass
has been shown to correlate with drug sensitivity and was often detectable
before classical apoptotic signals. A major limitation of this previous
work is that it is not obviously extensible to real patient tumors
owing to potential artifacts that would be generated by the removal
of cells from their microenvironment and deleterious effects of excision
and purification.

In this present work, we show that simple
excision of human TNBC
patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors followed by enzymatic disaggregation
into single cell suspension is sufficient to allow rapid and accurate
biomass accumulation-based prediction of in vivo sensitivity to the
chemotherapeutic drug carboplatin. We successfully correlate in vitro
biomass results with in vivo treatment results in two carboplatin-resistant
and one carboplatin-sensitive, matched TNBC PDX models. Importantly,
while not fully recapitulating a human tumor, owing to the absence
of tumor/immune system interactions and other factors, PDX preclinical
cancer models have been shown to maintain the gene expression heterogeneity
and histology seen in primary tumors.15 As a result, PDX models are a much more relevant platform to evaluate
the translational potential of biomass accumulation drug response
assays than cell lines.

In these studies, we used a bespoke
optical cell biomass measurement
system, the high speed live cell interferometer (HSLCI).14 HSLCI uses an automated scanning platform and
an interferometric camera to measure the biomass of 103 to 104 cells in a standard glass-bottomed 24-well culture
plate over time.8 Biomass accumulation
kinetic responses were determined by continuously measuring single
cells or small cell clusters every 10 min. Compared to conventional
methods of tumor profiling, the HSLCI has advantages of reduced cost,
no labels, short turnaround time, and multiparameterized outcomes.
Furthermore, drug resistance assessments take ∼40 h, compared
to 3–7 d for chemosensitivity assays, making the HSLCI better
matched for evaluating fragile primary patient samples. The acquisition
of single-cell drug responses in a heterogeneous population, which
are not easily determined from primary tissue using conventional assays,
has potential as a clinically relevant indicator for whole tumor response
and drug resistance predictions.

Results and Discussion
Effects
of Carboplatin on PDX Models
The in vitro response
to carboplatin of three TNBC PDX models (HCI01, HCI09, and UCD52)
was monitored following the timeline and protocol described in Figure 1a. Tumors were excised
and enzymatically digested into single-cell suspensions. Following
this, cells were placed in a 24-well glass bottom plate with media,
dosed with carboplatin, and then monitored for up to 36 h after dosing
using the HSLCI system. As carboplatin is not cell cycle-specific,
we anticipated detecting responses within 36 h postdosing. Each assay
included parallel measurements across a log-scale range of carboplatin
doses in the same plate. The 1× dose in this range (40–70
μM) corresponds to the equivalent maximum serum concentration
measured in patients receiving FDA-approved therapeutic doses of carboplatin
(Figure S1a).16 Example results from one replicate assay for each PDX model are
shown in Figure 1b.
The data from three independent replicates were compiled to calculate
an EC50 and plot a dose response (Figure 1c). The in vitro assays predicted that the
PDX model UCD52 (EC50 69 μM) would be substantially
more sensitive than either HCI01 (EC50 2.1 × 102 μM) or HCI09 (EC50 3.2 × 102 μM) models to a single equivalent dose of carboplatin administered
in vivo.

assay for each of the three PDX models (n = 1296,

scatter plot represent the mass accumulation rates of single cells
measured over the interval 24–36 postdosing. Box-plot notches
are indicative of 95% confidence intervals for the medians. (c) EC50 calculated by sigmoidal fit to the median mass accumulation
rates for each sample and dose. N = 3 replicates.

In vivo studies (Figure 2a) were performed by first
seeding and then expanding mammary
tumors in all three TNBC models, followed by single dose administration
of vehicle or carboplatin at 40 mg/kg on days 21, 24, or 35 depending
on tumor growth. This dose approximates to around 3.3 ± 1.4 mg·min/mL
in humans (Figure S1b).16,17 Tumor size was determined daily in live animals by caliper measurements.
As predicted by the in vitro assay, the UCD52 model was the only PDX
model to demonstrate a decrease in tumor size (Figure 2b). Tumors continued growing in both HCI01
and HCI09 models after treatment, with HCI09 growing more aggressively,
a result concordant with the higher EC50 for HCI09 measured
in the in vitro biomass accumulation assay.

(b) Relative tumor size measured by caliper measurement over the course

mm2 and then treatment with a single 40 mg/kg carboplatin
dose at days 35, 21, or 24 for HCI09, HCI01, and UCD52, respectively,
depending on tumor growth rate. (N = 4, 4, 6 carboplatin
treated mice with 2, 3, 5 control mice, respectively).

Comparison to Metabolic-Based Luciferase
Assays
Analogous
to the in vitro HSLCI experiments, tumors were digested and assessed
for viability using luciferase-based assays, a gold standard method4,18 (Figure 3). After
72 h of dosing, the relative sensitivity of each of the three lines
was the same as HSLCI measurements with HCI09 most-resistant and UCD52
most-sensitive. Metabolic-based assays have been shown to have a good
sensitivity of ∼90% but a poor specificity of ∼70% in
predicting in vivo outcomes.5 The ability
of these assays to predict resistance in vivo is not strong enough
for clinicians to trust these assays and has prevented clinical adoption.
Potentially, the HSLCI can improve specificity in viability assays
though the limited time cells are in culture (24 vs 72 h) and single
cell sensitivity. The HSLCI predicted a higher level of resistance
in HCI01 at 100 μM, which is reflected in the continued tumor
growth in vivo, an unsuccessful outcome of treatment.

Figure 3 Cell viability in response
to carboplatin as measured by luciferase
assay. Cell viability in response to carboplatin was measured by gold
standard assays in UCD52, HCI01, and HCI09 (n = 4,
7, and 6 separate experiments, respectively). Error bars represent
standard deviation.

Although a similar number
of cells per well was used in each assay
(25 000-luciferase, 50 000-HSLCI), only five percent
of well area was imaged by HSLCI. Future adaptions of HSLCI could
be modified to use smaller amounts of material as only ∼200
cells per condition were required to get a signal.

Response Heterogeneity
in Carboplatin-Sensitive Tumors
As shown in Figure 1b, the biomass accumulation
rates of cells within the measured populations
of all three TNBC PDX models exhibited significant heterogeneity.
Under the imaging conditions used, this heterogeneity in biomass accumulation
rates represents biological variation and not measurement noise.9,14 Of particular interest were cells which demonstrated robust growth
despite a substantial population-level dose-dependent loss of biomass
response. These cells could be analogous to subpopulations of drug-resistant
cells seen in patient TNBC tumors, which are subsequently selected
for undesirable expansion or persistence by drug treatment, making
them responsible for the recurrence of tumors often seen in TNBC.
Therefore, identification and isolation of these “non-responder”
cells for further genomic and phenotypic characterization may aid
in our mechanistic understanding of drug response heterogeneity in
cancer.

Figure 4 shows two representative examples of the biomass accumulation responses
from individual cells from the most-sensitive PDX model, UCD52, after
treatment with 100 μM carboplatin, which is higher than the
maximum concentration experienced in humans (Figure S1). These cells showed biomass accumulation rates of −1.5
and 2.3% per hour between hours 24–36, posttreatment. Interestingly,
during hours 24–36 posttreatment, in this representative experiment
47 cells, or 16% of surviving cells at 36 h exposed to 100 μM
carboplatin, gained biomass at a rate of 1% or more per hour. However,
the percentage of “non-responders” in the original population
is lower, as the number of living cells measured at later time points
is significantly reduced, relative to predosing levels, due to treatment.

Figure 4 Examples
of resistant and sensitive UCD52 cells to 100 μM
carboplatin. UCD52 cells were exposed for 100 μM carboplatin
and then monitored for 36 h afterward. The mass vs time plots refer
to the cells encircled in red and the color scale bars to the left
apply to all images. The top UCD52 cell was sensitive to treatment,
whereas the bottom UCD52 cell grew despite high carboplatin dose,
indicating heterogeneity of response and potentially resistant cells
among a sensitive tumor. The white scale bars are all 10 μm.

During tumor resection, disaggregation,
and enzymatic digestion,
only large pieces of debris are filtered out. Furthermore, beyond
the surgical excision step, there is no active selection of breast
cancer cells. As a result, the cells measured by the HSLCI are a combination
of stromal and tumor cells. In previous fluorescence-associated cell-sorting
experiments that specified epithelial and stromal cells, between 80
and 85% of cells were found to be cancer cells.18 While a lack of biomarker-based tumor cell selection increases
the ease of use and decreases the expense of each HSLCI run, the presence
of nontumor cells and pieces of cell debris whose biomasses remain
static could obscure measurements.

These challenges are overcome
using two strategies. First, as PDX
tumor cells are non-adherent, they remained in three-dimensional (3D)
spherical shape and relatively dense with many PDX cells having subregions
of biomass density over 8 pg/um2. This 3D shape causes
PDX cells to remain in a focal plane distinct from stromal cells,
such as fibroblasts which attach to the bottom of the plate. This
allows for the HSLCI to focus on the imaging plane directly above
the bottom of plate on cells that are not attached. Second, fibroblasts
have a typical area of around 3600 μm2, whereas unattached
cancer cells have an area of approximately 200–800 μm2.19 This size disparity allows
for the rapid resolution of cell type. Future analyses could leverage
distinct phenotypic features of fibroblasts, such as lamellipodia,
which decrease circularity and further distinguish stromal cells from
tumor cells. Finally, debris are easily distinguished by their low
biomass, allowing in silico exclusion. Importantly, the same filtering
methodology was applied across all three PDX models evaluated in these
experiments. Definitive growth response signals were detected in all
three PDX models.

These study results demonstrate HSLCI’s
ability to rapidly
quantify the drug sensitivity of single, freshly explanted tumors
cells, within 40 h of excision. This time scale is feasible in the
clinic as it is the same as widely used antibiotic susceptibility
tests. This builds upon previous work with the HSLCI platform that
quantified single-cell sensitivity of melanoma cell lines to vemurafenib14 and overcomes the lack of ex vivo cell proliferation
seen in most cancers, including these TNBC PDX models.18

To succeed as a clinical assay for personalized
therapeutic susceptibility,
the HSLCI must have faster turnaround times and demonstrate in vivo
sensitivity correlations better than current in vitro methods, which
have not seen wide-scale adoption. With a maximum turnaround time
of 40 h from tumor excision to useable results and a fully-automated
analysis pipeline, the HSLCI reduces both cost and time compared to
current gold standard methods. Furthermore, these initial results
are promising as they demonstrate the correlation of in vitro drug
sensitivity profiling with in vivo assessments of therapeutic efficacy
in preclinical PDX breast cancer models.

Future research utilizing
HSLCI will include increased throughput
and the characterization of resistant subpopulations to assess whether
the identified cells by HSLCI are the same cells that proliferate
in vivo, leading to therapy resistance commonly seen in TNBC. Additionally,
HSLCI will also be used to assess drug sensitivity in biopsies from
TNBC and other human solid tumors.

Methods
PDX Mouse Models
Three triple negative PDX lines, HCI01,
HCI09, and UCD52 were obtained from the Huntsman Cancer Institute
(HCI) and University of Colorado Denver (UCD). Cells were resuspended
in Matrigel (Corning) and injected into the fourth mammary fat pads
of non-obese diabetic severe combined immunodeficient gamma (NSG)
mice.

Preparation of Tumor Suspension
As described in Turner
et al.18 and DeRose et al.,15 PDX tumors were excised from the mammary fat
pads of NSG mice once they had reached approximately 10 mm ×
10 mm in size. Untreated tumors were digested with a solution of DMEM/F12,
5% fetal bovine serum, 300 U/mL Collagenase (Sigma), and 100 U/mL
hyaluronidase (Sigma). Digested tissue was resuspended in NH4Cl and trypsinized to generate single cell suspensions.

HSLCI Operation
The HSLCI system and analysis pipeline
are identical to that described in detail in Huang et al.14 The HSLCI platform consists of a custom-built
inverted optical microscope coupled to an off-axis quadriwave lateral
shearing interferometric camera (SID4BIO, Phasics, Inc.). Cells are
imaged in single, standard-footprint (128 mm × 85 mm), glass-bottomed,
multiwell plates. Acquired images are analyzed in near real-time by
a downstream PC (Dell Precision Tower 5810). All of the platform’s
hardware and software components are available commercially. A 40×
objective (Nikon, NA 0.75) was used for the growth kinetics studies
described.

The HSLCI platform was installed inside a standard
cell culture incubator (Steri-Cult CO2 Incubator, Thermo Fisher).
Cells were plated on 24-well glass bottom plates at 5 × 104 cells per well in M87 medium15 and doses of pharmaceutical grade carboplatin, obtained from VCU
Dalton Oncology Clinic, ranging from 0 to 1 mM. Plates were incubated
for 24 h and then imaged by the HSLCI for 12 h.

To account for
the potential noise introduced by drifting cells
and cell debris that could artificially impact measured growth rates
of stable cells, data were quality-filtered such that only biomass
tracks (mass vs time) exhibiting linear fit standard errors of less
than 0.002 normalized mass units per hour, and a total mass of greater
than 300 pg but less than 3000 pg were included. These error bounds
ensure that our confidence in the hourly mass accumulation rates is
±0.2% and that only true physiologic cell growth is measured.
The minimum mass filter ensures that our data only include individual
cells or two-three cell clusters, and not cell debris.

In Vivo Mouse
Studies
Mammary tumors were generated
by injecting 500 000 cells from HCI01, HCI09, or UCD52 single
cell suspensions into the abdominal mammary gland in 50% Matrigel.
After ∼3 weeks, when tumors were in log-phase growth (30–60
mm2), a single intraperitoneal injection of vehicle (normal
saline) or carboplatin (40 mg/kg) was administered. Mice were randomized
to have some small and some larger treated tumors in vehicle or carboplatin-treated
group. Tumor sizes were recorded for an additional 3 weeks.

Luciferase
Assays
HCI09, HCI01, and UCD52 cells were
plated in M87 media, in triplicate (25 000 cells/100 μL
per well) in 96-well plates coated with poly-2-hydroxyethyl-methylacrylate
(poly-HEMA) to provide a low-attachment surface and incubated at 37
°C for 3 days with six different concentrations of carboplatin.
To assess cell viability over time, d-luciferin (10 μL/well)
was added and plates were IVIS-imaged on day 3.
