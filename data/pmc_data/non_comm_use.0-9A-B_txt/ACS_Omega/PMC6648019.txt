Dextrin
is a derivative of starch produced by partial thermal degradation
under acidic conditions, which is usually used as a depressant in
the mineral processing industry. Dextrin can also effectively depress
coal particles in the reverse flotation process. To study the effect
of dextrin on the flotation behavior of both coal and gangue mineral
in coal reverse flotation, this research compared the adsorption behavior
difference between sub-bituminous coal and silica as well as the surface
property change of both sub-bituminous coal and silica after being
treated by dextrin. The result illustrates that the adsorbing capacity
of sub-bituminous coal on dextrin is much higher than that of silica
under different initial concentrations and different interaction times.
The isoelectric points of both sub-bituminous coal and silica increase
after being treated by dextrin. But the increasing ζ-potential
value of silica is larger than that of sub-bituminous coal. Dextrin
could enhance the hydrophilicity of sub-bituminous coal and weaken
the hydrophilicity of silica slightly according to the result of surface
wetting rate tests. Reverse flotation using dextrin as a depressant
indicates that good performance could be obtained with the addition
of dextrin. Larger dextrin dosage might deteriorate silica flotation
slightly.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Dextrin is one kind of
starchy polysaccharide reagent, which is
a derivative of starch produced by partial thermal degradation under
acidic conditions.1 Dextrin has higher
branched polymeric carbohydrates and is composed of dextrose units.
The structure of dextrin is shown in Figure 1.1,2 This starchy reagent
is one common flotation depressant in mineral processing industrial
engineering. It has been used in phosphate and gangue mineral flotation
in 1931 for the first time, as well as the flotation of sulfide ores,
oxidized ores, saline minerals, natural element minerals, other nonmetal
minerals, etc.3 The adsorption of dextrin
on mineral surface could be in different ways, such as chemisorption,
hydrophobic-hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen-bond interaction, electrostatic
interaction, etc. During the reverse flotation of rutile and hematite,
dextrin used as a depressant interacted with minerals through chemical
interaction.4 In 1974, Wie and Fuerstenau
researched about the effect of dextrin on molybdenite and proposed
that the adsorption of dextrin on a molybdenite surface might be hydrogen-bond
interaction for the first time.5 Miller
et al. found that dextrin only has strong interaction on the hydrophobic
surface of mineral but has weak interaction on the hydrophilic mineral
surface such as pyrite. When pyrite is associated with coal or has
been treated by xanthate, the adsorption capacity of dextrin strengthens,
which proves that the adsorption of dextrin on the pyrite surface
is hydrogen-bond interaction further.6 X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy and Auger electron spectroscopy were used
to test the mineral surface property change before and after adsorbing
dextrin.7 It was found that the Auger parameter
change of Ba element on the surface of barite was obvious (−0.75
eV), which meant that the interaction of dextrin on the barite surface
is chemisorption. While the Auger parameter change of Ba element on
the surface of barite before and after adsorbing dextrin was very
weak (−0.20 eV), which was more likely to be physical, such
as hydrogen-bond interaction.7

of the dextrin molecule.

Dextrin is also usually used as a depressant in coal reverse
flotation,
during which process coal is depressed and gangue mineral is floated.1,8−10 In the complex pulp system of coal reverse flotation
process, the co-adsorption of dextrin on minerals would affect the
performance of reverse flotation. Therefore, it is very necessary
to study the adsorption behavior difference between coal and gangue
mineral on dextrin, as well as the surface characteristic change rule
of coal and gangue mineral after adsorbing dextrin. This research
result might provide theoretical guidance for coal reverse flotation.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Experimental Materials
The coal sample
used in this study was sub-bituminous coal collected from the Powder
River coal basin of the U.S. The coal sample after sampling was crushed
to below 200 μm by a hammer mill. The particle size fractions
of the sample were obtained by sieving using lab vibrating screens,
and the result is shown in Table 1. The proximate analysis of sub-bituminous coal is
as follows: moisture 27.72%, ash dry 8.81%, volatile 46.62%, fixed
carbon 16.85%, and sulfur 0.72%. The particle size fractions of the
silica sample (ASTM quartz c-778 purchased from ebay, purity 98.8%)
is as follows: 10%, 1.53 μm; 50%, 7.24 μm; 90%, 26.71
μm; mean size, 10.87 μm.

2.2 Chemical
Reagents
The chemical formula
of dextrin (Fisher Scientific) used in this research is (C6H10O5)x and the
molecular weight is 162.067 g/mol. Dextrin was used as 1% solution.
The preparation steps are as follows: first, 1 g of dextrin powder
was taken in a 100 mL volumetric flask and deionized water was added
to make it 100 mL. Then, the bottle plug was screwed and the volumetric
flask was moved up and down several times. Finally, the volumetric
flask was put into a 60 °C thermostatic water bath to dissolve
the contents faster. Dextrin solution should be made everyday to prevent
biological decomposition. The complex cationic ammonium salt, Lilaflot
D817M (AKZO NOBEL), was used as a collector in this study.1,9,10 It was also used as a 1% solution.
Distilled water was used throughout the tests.

2.3 Experimental
Methods
2.3.1 TOC Test
For the test, 1 g/100
mL dextrin solution was diluted to 10–500 mg/L in a test tube.
For this, 20 mL of diluent was added to the test tube. A TOC analyzer
was used to measure the total carbon content in dextrin solution at
different concentrations to obtain the linear relation curve between
the dextrin solution concentration and the total carbon content. The
linear relation curve would be taken as a standard curve.

The
adsorption capacity of dextrin on minerals was obtained by calculating
the difference of the total carbon content in dextrin solution before
and after being adsorbed by samples. The test steps are as follows:
first, 1 g of sub-bituminous coal or silica was measured and added
to a 100 mL beaker containing 100 mL dextrin solution at different
concentrations. The sample was agitated to disperse sufficiently using
a glass bar successively. Afterward, the beaker was placed on a magnetic
stirrer for 5 min to obtain sufficient adsorption. When it reaches
the adsorption equilibrium after 3 h of standing, the pulp was poured
into a pressure filter. After filtering using low-speed qualitative
filter paper, the filtrate was obtained. Then, 20 mL of the filtrate
was taken into a test tube, and the content of total carbon in dextrin
solution was measured using a TOC analyzer. Finally, the test result
was compared with the standard curve to get the difference value,
which is the adsorbing capacity.

2.3.2 ζ-Potential
Test
Both the
coal sample and silica used in the ζ-potential test were ground
to −30 μm using an agate pestle. HCl (25.00% v/v) and
NaOH (99.99% grade) were used for pH adjustment. The 10–3 M KCl solution was used as the supporting electrolyte. The concentration
of dextrin is 0.057 g/L. The ζ-potential analyzer used in this
research was manufactured by Brookhaven Instruments Corporation. All
of the measurements were performed following the steps in the instruction
manual. Distilled water was used in the whole process.

2.3.3 Surface Wetting Rate Test
After
adsorbing sufficiently in the reagent solution at 180 and 50 mg/L
concentrations, respectively, the sub-bituminous coal sample and silica
sample for the surface wetting rate were obtained after filtration
and low temperature drying. The surface wetting rate of minerals was
measured using surface tension apparatus (Tesiometer K100). The process
steps are conducted following the procedures described in the instruction
manual.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 FTIR Analysis of Sub-Bituminous Coal
FTIR (NEXUS) was
used to evaluate the functional groups on the coal
surface. The FTIR spectrum of sub-bituminous coal is shown in Figure 2. The absorbance
peak at about 3342 cm–1 is for −OH and the
high peak around 3600 cm–1 means that it has high
moisture content.11 The absorbance peak
at 1605 cm–1 is for −COOH and those between
1150 and 1380 cm–1 are for C–O and O–H
in phenoxy groups.12−15 All of these peaks are very high, indicating that there are high
contents of oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of
sub-bituminous coal. The oxygen-containing functional groups on the
surface of sub-bituminous coal would interact with water and increase
its surface hydrophilicity.1,15

3.2 Results
of Adsorption Test
The samples
used in the adsorption test are sub-bituminous coal and silica with
a whole size range. The adsorption formula of sub-bituminous coal
and silica on dextrin is as follows 1  where qc is the
equilibrium adsorption capacity (mg/g), C0 is the initial concentration of dextrin (mg/L), Cc is the equilibrium concentration (mg/L), v is the volume of the solution (L), and m is the
sample quality (g).

The relationship between the total carbon
content and the concentration of dextrin is shown in Figure 3. The standard curve of dextrin
solution is as follows 2  The correlation coefficient
is R2 = 0.99932. The effective concentration
range of dextrin
is 10–300 mg/L.

concentrations
(standard curve).

3.2.1 Adsorption
Property of Sub-Bituminous Coal
and Silica on Dextrin at Different Initial Concentrations
The adsorption property of sub-bituminous coal on dextrin at different
initial concentrations is shown in Figure 4. It can be seen from Figure 4 that during the whole tested dextrin concentration
range (0–250 mg/L), the adsorbing capacity of dextrin on sub-bituminous
coal is much higher than that on silica. The equilibrium adsorption
capacity of dextrin on sub-bituminous coal increases with the increase
of dextrin concentration, and the increase speed is higher than that
on silica. When dextrin concentration is larger than 50 mg/L, the
adsorption speed of dextrin on silica decreases, reaching adsorption
equilibrium; the equilibrium adsorption capacity is about 2.3 mg/g.
When the initial concentration of dextrin is larger than 180 mg/L,
the adsorption speed of sub-bituminous coal also decreases, and the
equilibrium adsorption capacity is about 4.56 mg/g.

coal and silica on dextrin at
different initial concentrations.

3.2.2 Adsorption Property of Sub-Bituminous Coal
and Silica on Dextrin at Different Adsorption Times
The dextrin
concentrations were set when sub-bituminous coal and silica reach
adsorption equilibrium, which are 180 and 50 mg/L, respectively, as
the initial concentrations to explore the adsorption kinetics of sub-bituminous
coal and silica. The adsorption time was set as follows: 10, 20, 40,
60, 90, 120, and 180 min. The adsorption capacity was obtained by
comparing the result with the standard curve. Figure 5 illustrates the adsorption property of dextrin
on sub-bituminous coal and silica at different adsorption times. It
could be seen that the adsorption rate of dextrin on sub-bituminous
coal is very fast within 60 min and reaches equilibrium (4.53 mg/g)
at about 120 min. While the adsorption rate of dextrin on silica decreases
gradually after 40 min and reaches adsorption equilibrium (2.00 mg/g)
at about 60 min. This is because dextrin concentration is very large
at the beginning, and there are also many active sites on the surface
of particles, which lead the adsorption rate faster at the beginning
relatively. Comparing the adsorption curve of dextrin on sub-bituminous
coal and silica at different adsorption times, it can be seen that
the adsorption rate of dextrin on sub-bituminous coal is higher than
that on silica at the initial 120 min. But during the whole process,
the adsorption capacity of dextrin on sub-bituminous coal is always
higher than that on silica. This means that during the process of
reverse flotation, dextrin has better selectivity to the goal mineral,
sub-bituminous coal.

3.3 Influence
of Dextrin on the Surface Property
of Sub-Bituminous Coal and Silica
3.3.1 Effect
of Dextrin on the ζ-Potential
of Minerals
Figure 6 shows the effect of dextrin on the ζ-potential of sub-bituminous
coal after adsorbing dextrin. It can be seen that the isoelectric
point of sub-bituminous coal increases from pH 3 to about pH 3.3 after
the adsorption of dextrin. With the increase of pH, the electronegativity
enhances gradually. During the whole test range, the ζ-potential
value of sub-bituminous coal after being treated by dextrin is a little
higher than that before adsorbing dextrin.

Figure 6 Effect of dextrin on
the surface ζ-potential of sub-bituminous
coal.

The ζ-potential change law
of silica before and after adsorbing
dextrin is shown in Figure 7. It could be seen that the isoelectric point of silica before
adsorbing dextrin is at about pH 2. With the increase of pH, the electronegativity
enhances gradually. After the adsorption of dextrin, the isoelectric
point of silica increases to about pH 3.2. During the whole test range,
the ζ-potential value of silica after being treated by dextrin
is also a little higher than that before the adsorption of dextrin.

Figure 7 Effect
of dextrin on the surface ζ-potential of silica.

3.3.2 Effect of Dextrin on
the Wettability Rate
of Minerals
Figures 8 and 9 illustrate the wettability curves
of sub-bituminous coal with deionized water and normal hexane, respectively.
It can be seen that the wettability rate of sub-bituminous coal after
adsorbing dextrin is higher (0.0015 g2/s) than that before
adsorbing dextrin (0.009 g2/s) when using deionized water
as the wetting liquid. When the wetting liquid is changed to normal
hexane, the wettability rate of sub-bituminous coal after adsorbing
dextrin is lower (0.0015 g2/s) than that before adsorbing
dextrin (0.0030 g2/s). This indicates that the hydrophilicity
of sub-bituminous coal enhances and the hydrophobicity weakens after
adsorbing dextrin. Figures 10 and 11 show the wettability curves
of silica before and after being treated by dextrin with different
wetting liquids. It could be known that the wettability rate of silica
after adsorbing dextrin is lower (0.0031 g2/s) than that
before adsorbing dextrin (0.0045 g2/s) when using deionized
water as the wetting liquid. The wettability rate of silica after
adsorbing dextrin increases slightly (0.0024 g2/s) than
that before adsorbing dextrin (0.0021 g2/s) when the wetting
liquid is changed to normal hexane. This indicates that the hydrophilicity
of silica weakens and the hydrophobicity enhances slightly after adsorbing
dextrin.

coal (deionized water).

Figure 9 Effect of dextrin on the surface wettability rate of sub-bituminous
coal (n-hexane).

Figure 10 Effect of dextrin on the surface wettability rate of silica (deionized
water).

Figure 11 Effect of dextrin on the surface wettability
rate of silica (n-hexane).

Table 2 illustrates
the surface wetting rate results of sub-bituminous coal and silica
before and after adsorbing dextrin. It can be known that dextrin could
enhance the hydrophilicity of sub-bituminous coal as a depressant
in coal reverse flotation. However, dextrin weakens the surface hydrophilicity
of silica. Therefore, excessive dextrin might deteriorate the flotation
of silica.

3.4 Reverse
Flotation Test
Reverse flotation
with artificial mixed flotation feed was conducted referring to the
previous research.9 The ratio of sub-bituminous
coal to silica is 7:3. Dextrin and ammonium salt Lilaflot D817M were
used as a depressant and collector, respectively. The effect of dextrin
on reverse flotation results is shown in Figure 12. As can be seen that the combustible matter
recovery increases from 74.12 to 86.87% when dextrin dosage increases
from 0 to 1 kg/t, indicating that more coal particles are depressed.
The separation efficiency also increases significantly, from 62.70
to 71.45%, after 1 kg/t dextrin was added. This means that the addition
of a depressant could enhance coal reverse flotation performance very
well. With the increase of dextrin dosage, the separation efficiency
increases slightly. The ash content of the concentrate increases from
7.58 to 8.23% after the addition of 1 kg/t dextrin, indicating that
more dextrin would affect the recovery of silica in the froth product.
The ash content of the concentrate increases slightly when dextrin
dosage changes from 1 to 4 kg/t. It is concluded that low dextrin
dosage (1 kg/t) would be the best for coal reverse flotation to obtain
relatively good separation efficiency.

Figure 12 Effect of dextrin on
reverse flotation performance (pulp concentration
40 g/L, collector Lilaflot D817M 2 kg/t, frother MIBC 20 ppm, conditioning
time 0 min, and conditioning speed 1000 rpm).

4 Conclusions
Dextrin is usually used
as a depressant in mineral processing,
especially in coal reverse flotation. The adsorption behavior difference
of dextrin on sub-bituminous coal and silica was compared. It is found
that the adsorption capacity of dextrin on sub-bituminous coal is
always higher than that on silica under different conditions. Dextrin
could increase the isoelectric point of both sub-bituminous coal and
silica. The hydrophilicity of sub-bituminous coal after being treated
by dextrin enhances while that of silica weakens slightly according
to the result of surface wetting rate tests. The addition of low dosage
dextrin (1 kg/t) could help in obtaining good reverse flotation performance.
