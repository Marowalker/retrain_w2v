Polymer
flooding is one of the most incipient chemical-based enhanced
oil recovery process that utilizes the injection of polymer solutions
into oil reservoirs. The presence of a polymer in water increases
the viscosity of the injected fluid, which upon injection reduces
the water-to-oil mobility ratio and the permeability of the porous
media, thereby improving oil recovery. The objective of this work
is to investigate strategies that would help increase oil recovery.
For that purpose, we have studied the effect of injection pressure
and increasing polymer concentration on flooding performance. This
work emphasizes on the development of a detailed mathematical model
describing fluid saturations, pressure, and polymer concentration
during the injection experiments and predicts oil recovery. The mathematical
model developed for simulations is a black oil model consisting of
a two-phase flow (aqueous and oleic) of polymeric solutions in one-dimensional
porous media as a function of time and z-coordinate.
The mathematical model consisting of heterogeneous, nonlinear, and
simultaneous partial differential equations efficiently describes
the physical process and consists of various parameters and variables
that are involved in our lab-scale process to quantify and analyze
them. A dimensionless numerical solution is achieved using the finite
difference method. We implement the second-order high-accuracy central
and backward finite-divided-difference formula along the z-direction that results in the discretization of the partial differential
equations into ordinary differential equations with time as an independent
variable. The input parameters such as porosity, permeability, saturation,
and pore volume obtained from experimental data by polymer flooding
are used in the simulation of the developed mathematical model. The
model-predicted and commercial reservoir (CMG)-simulated oil production
is in good agreement with experimental oil recoveries with a root-mean-square
error (RMSE) in the range of 1.5–2.5 at a maximum constant
pressure of 3.44 MPa as well as with temporal variation of the injection
pressure between 2.41 and 3.44 MPa.

1 Introduction
Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) processes endeavor to improve the recovery
of hydrocarbons from oil reservoirs following primary production using
water flooding.1 In water flooding, the
oil reservoirs are mandated to be operated at an elevated pressure
in addition to its prevailing colossal pressure conditions subjected
to its large top overburden; regulation of the same is not only very
challenging, but also it may lead to some unusual hazards inside the
geological core. However, oil recovery due to primary production is
highly inefficient, resulting in their utmost economic thresholds
of producing only 20–25% of the original oil-in-place (OOIP).2

A large proportion of crude oil remains
in the reservoir after
the application of primary recovery and secondary recovery processes.
The entrapment of residual oil is related to the porous capillary
structure of the reservoir rock. The capillary effect becomes more
dominant as the relative oil structure decreases, resulting in the
entrapment of oil in place by reducing the fluidity ratio between
oil and aqueous phases.2,3 In the present global scenario,
the development of an injection strategy having the potential of uplifting
the incremental oil recovery by more than 50% OOIP has gained considerable
attention in the field of research and technology.4 Among chemical-based enhanced oil recovery processes, polymer
flooding is highly practiced in conventional oil reservoirs with a
remarkable success rate. Polymeric solutions with high molecular weights
effectively increase the viscosity of the displacing fluid, which
upon injection in the reservoir core aids in the diminution of water-to-oil
mobility ratio and permeability of the injected fluid.5−7 The net result is the increase in oil displacement, reservoir sweep
efficiencies, and pressure gradient, especially in heterogeneous oil
reservoirs.8−11

In this context, rigorous simulation studies of the experimental
profiles of polymer flooding is highly necessitated. Additionally,
the implementation of robust optimization techniques becomes highly
crucial in the milieu of achieving maximum oil recoveries at the lowest
possible capital investment. Optimization involves maximizing the
objective function (cumulative oil recovery) from a polymer-flooded
oil reservoir by manipulating multifarious input conditions like injection
concentration, injection flow rate, etc. In recent times, many researchers
have proposed mathematical models of polymer flooding to evaluate
the flow of viscoelastic polymer through a porous medium. In these
studies, some of the most important effects and phenomena such as
dispersion-diffusion, salt effects (which reduce the injection fluid
viscosity), thermal effects, effective concentration, inaccessible
pore volume, polymer retention or adsorption on rock surface, permeability
reduction of water phase, elastic behavior of viscoelastic polymers
(which leads to pistonlike displacement of oil), equivalent shear
rate in porous media, and reduction in residual oil saturation have
not been considered or have not been fully investigated. Zhang et
al.12 studied modeling and simulation of
partially hydrolyzed polymaleic anhydride flow through porous media.
The mathematical model incorporated several important effects such
as polymer relaxation time, adsorption, permeability reduction factor,
elongation viscosity, elastic behavior, and viscosity as a function
of polymer concentration and shear rate; the prime focus was to estimate
the functionality of polymer elasticity and relaxation time on EOR.
A complete polymer flooding flow model incorporating polymer degradation,
adsorption, elastic effects, salt effects, diffusion, inaccessible
pore volume, permeability reduction of water phase, shear thinning
behavior, and polymer rheology was presented by Wang and Liu.13 The flow equations for aqueous, oleic, polymer,
and salt were solved by IMPES and Runge–Kutta methods for improving
convergence in scale (60 m × 60 m × 3 m) in Bohai Bay offshore
oilfield in China. To achieve better oil recovery, polymeric solutions
can be employed in conjunction with other enhanced oil recovery processes,
such as surfactant–polymer flooding, synergetic effect of alkaline–surfactant–polymer
flooding (ASP), and polymer–alternating–gas processes
in which the polymeric phase is envisioned to play a vital role in
controlling the mobility ratio.14 To that
end, more advanced and detailed polymer flooding models incorporating
pH effects are mandated.

Numerous studies have focused on generating
and calibrating surfactant–polymer
flooding simulation profiles in predictive modeling framework that
entails the computational adeptness in terms of both validation and
prediction. Alsofi et al.15 performed a
similar study by using the University of Texas Chemical Flood Simulator:
UTCHEM. The model was built using experimental data and later on was
calibrated and validated through history-matching oil-displacement
core flooding results. Their predictive SP model was more unique and
robust compared to the similar work in the literature.16−19 Recently, in 2016, Ferreira et al.20 presented
a straightforward and low-cost aiding tool that was used to determine
retention levels, inaccessible pore volume, and in situ viscosity
in a single-phase one-dimensional (1D) polymer flooding experiments.

The simulation of experimental results of chemical flooding is
very important for designing or optimizing decision-making variables
such as cumulative oil recovery factor and net present value (from
economic perspectives). Judicial selection of a reservoir simulator
is highly significant for analyzing any relevant real-time investigation.
The simulator should have the pertinent functionalities required not
only for modeling core flooding experiments for better understanding
of the polymer flow behavior during chemical flooding, but also for
parametric simulation, which can be effectively employed in commercial-scale
applications. Different commercial simulators utilized for modeling
complex chemical-enhanced oil recovery processes were ECLIPSE by Schlumberger,
STARS developed by CMG, and UTCHEM that has been created at the University
of Texas at Austin for research-scale applications. UTCHEM has attractive
features such as the ability of modeling lab-scale experiments and
simulating complex chemical reactions as well as polymer behavior.
Due to its worldwide applications, it has been used by many researchers.21−27 ECLIPSE is a fully implicit, three-phase, three-dimensional (rectangular
coordinates) black oil simulator and commonly practiced in the industries
for field-scale applications to model different chemical EOR processes,
including surfactant and polymer flooding. Morel et al.28 performed the feasibility study of polymer injection
in Dalia field using ECLIPSE polymer module and achieved commendable
results about additional oil recovery and polymer injectivity. STARS
by CMG is the advanced process reservoir simulator and has the potential
to model both lab-scale and field-scale models. Furthermore, it has
the proficiency to accommodate and simulate complex chemical-enhanced
oil recovery processes such as polymer flooding, surfactant flooding,
steam flooding, and in situ combustion. Thus, the different commercial
simulators available for predicting the EOR process have not considered
some important empirical correlations necessary for polymer flooding.
Therefore, there is a need to develop a detailed model for predicting
heavy-oil recovery using polymer flooding. Recently, Liang et al.29 have demonstrated the thermal stability and
salinity resistance of various polymers such as diutan gum, scleroglucan,
xanthan gum, and HPAM in high-temperature and high-salinity oil reservoirs
for the EOR process.

The objective of this paper is to develop
and integrate a detailed
mathematical model for the lab-scale replica of the process in our
laboratory. To that end, we carry out experiments by injecting partially
hydrolyzed polyacrylamide solutions of concentration 1000–5000
ppm to a lab-scale, cylindrical heavy-oil reservoir model at different
pressure magnitudes (1.03–3.44 MPa). The objective is rationalized
through a scaled mathematical model and by numerically integrating
a set of nonlinear, heterogeneous, and simultaneous partial differential
equations describing fluid saturations, pressure, and polymer concentration,
respectively, in a 1D two-phase flow of polymeric solutions across
a porous media. Finally, the model-predicted results are validated
by the obtained core flooding experimental mass. Furthermore, a computer
program has been developed in C++ environment to perform calculations
and solve water-phase saturation, pressure, and concentration equations
in cylindrical coordinates. The model can be applied to predict oil
recovery of other core flooding conditions. It is noteworthy that
the proposed model and computational interface is quite simple and
cost-effective for one-dimensional polymer flooding experimental investigations
in both lab-scale and commercial-scale applications. Additionally,
the oil recoveries are also successfully verified by comparison with
both the commercial reservoir simulator (CMG) and experimental data.
Moreover, the extended predictive control strategy with an introduction
of new PI controller tuning scheme using the closed-loop data developed
by Yadav et al.30 can be implemented to
depict the efficiency of the controller (pressure controller) with
an integration of the developed pressure equation under process uncertainty
and compared to other well-developed control schemes.

2 Mathematical Modeling
The flow of polymeric solution in
porous media is considered to
be a complex phenomenon; therefore, the development of a detailed
mathematical model is a prerequisite for depicting the physics of
the process in the lab-scale replica. Polymer transport in porous
media is subjected to many particular effects such as non-Newtonian
fluid flow, adsorption, inaccessible pore volume, polymer retention,
residual resistance factor, permeability reduction factor, and the
effect of polymer concentration and shear rate on polymer solution
viscosity. The aforementioned parameters are coupled together in a
differential framework to evaluate the efficacy of a polymer flooding
project in one-dimensional injection experiments across a porous media.
The mathematical model comprising the oleic and aqueous phase saturation
and pressure and polymer concentration mass balance is analyzed in
a cylindrical differential element of thickness Δz (along the z-direction). During the development
of the mathematical model, the following set of assumptions are made:(1) Fluid flow is isothermal
and energy
exchange is neglected.

(2) Liquids are nonvolatile, and there
are only two fluid phases (oleic and aqueous) with three species involved
throughout the process (oil, water, and polymer).

(3) The heavy oil is insoluble in polymer
solution, and thermal equilibrium exists between oleic and aqueous
phases.

(4) No chemical
and biological reaction
takes place between the species.

(5) Adsorption of polymer flooding takes
place on the solid matrix inside the cylindrical core, resulting from
the bulk flow and dispersion mechanism of the mass transport.

(6) The bulk flow is along
the z-direction, and the same is governed by Darcy’s
law in a porous medium.

(7) Bulk flow (due to diffusion) across
the radial direction is neglected.

(8) The density of the heavy oil is constant
throughout the process.

(9) The porous media has uniform porosity
and permeability. Thus, gravity and capillary pressure effects are
negligible.



Based on these assumptions,
the conservation of mass equations
and Darcy’s law for each component can be written as

Aqueous Phase Equation 1  Oil Phase Equation 2  Pressure Equation 3  Polymer Concentration Equation 4  

3 Empirical
Correlations and Parameters of Model
3.1 Effect
of Polymer Concentration on Solution
Viscosity
We considered the Flory–Huggins equation,
which describes the polymeric solution viscosity as a function of
polymer concentration at zero shear rate. Polymeric solutions behave
as a non-Newtonian fluid when flowing through a porous media, and
their rheological behavior is characterized by a Newtonian plateau
at lower shear rates. The apparent viscosity of the polymeric solution
depending on polymer concentration is given as 5  

3.2 Permeability
Reduction
The viscoelastic
flow of polymeric solutions through a porous media has a strong relationship
with its retention on a rock surface. This is mainly due to the polymer
adsorption, hydrodynamic retention, and mechanical entrapment.31 Adsorption of polymer causes the permeability
reduction of aqueous phase. Permeability reduction factor (Rk) is often defined as the ratio of rock permeability
when water flows to the rock permeability when polymer solution flows
through porous media.32 This phenomenon
is easily observed during lab-scale injection experiments as the pressure
gradient of the postflush water increases relative to the preflush
water. In this study, eq 6 was implemented to predict permeability reduction factor and was
represented by the following expression13 6  

3.3 Inaccessible Pore Volume
During core
flooding, a fraction of pore volume that cannot be accessed by polymer
molecules due to the difference in their molecular sizes and pore
sizes is termed as inaccessible pore volume. It ranges between 1 and
30% of pore volume depending on the size distribution of rock and
polymer. Laboratory-scale investigations indicate that it is relatively
greater than adsorption loss. Manichand and Seright31 collected experimental data about inaccessible pore volume
and concluded that there is no relationship between permeability and
inaccessible pore volume. In this study, we assume inaccessible pore
volume to be constant and was modeled by eq 7 7  

4 Scaling Analysis on Mathematical Model
Scaling of mathematical model is very essential to eliminate relatively
least significant terms from a mathematical statement. Scaling of
a process model has numerous advantages, and it involves the chain
rule for differentiation to simplify the associated equations. With
the help of scaling, one can easily transform the dimensional variables
and parameters of the real process model into its corresponding nondimensional
form. Due to the proper scaling of equations, it is easy to understand
which terms are effectively contributing to the process and which
are less significant. In this way, size and intricacy of the original
model get reduced. The scaled version of the mathematical model is
given below:

Scaled Aqueous Phase Equation 8  Here, z̅ is the dimensionless
axial coordinate, P̅ is the dimensionless pressure,
τ is the dimensionless time, and C̅ is
the dimensionless concentration.

Scaled Oil Phase Equation 9  Scaled Pressure Equation 10  Scaled Polymer Concentration Equation 11  

5 Discretized Mathematical Model
The above-mathematical
model consists of a set of nonlinear, heterogeneous,
and simultaneous partial differential equations that cannot be solved
analytically or by manual calculations. In this study, the problem
is simplified numerically using the finite difference method. We implement
the second-order high-accuracy central and backward finite-divided-difference
formula along the z-direction that results in the
discretization of the partial differential equations into ordinary
differential equations with respect to time (as the only associated
independent variable). With Nj grid points
along the z-direction shown in Figure 1, the discretized finite-differenced ordinary
differential equations are as follows:

is a function of time and length of the porous media. K is the absolute permeability of the porous medium, Kro is the oil relative permeability, Krw is the water relative permeability, φ is the
porosity of the porous media, and μo is the viscosity
of the heavy oil. The bulk flow of polymer solution along the z-direction is governed by the Darcy velocity. D is the diffusion coefficient of the solvent in the porous medium
and is negligible along the radial direction. Initially, there is
no polymer solution injection inside the cylindrical core and heavy-oil
production so that the initial length of the cylindrical core is z = 0 = zo. Thus, the initial
condition at t = 0 is given below 24  The boundary conditions at t ≥ 0 are 25  

6 Results and Discussion
The performance
of polymer flooding process and the effects of
pressure variations on heavy-oil recovery process were evaluated in
a homogeneous glass beads-packed physical model. For this study, experimental
investigations were carried out with polymer solutions of concentrations
1000–5000 ppm at (i) constant pressure of 3.44 MPa and with
(ii) time-varying pressure in the range of 1.03–3.44 MPa. For
variable-pressure experiments, the injection pressure was originally
set at 1.03 MPa and was increased to the maximum pressure of 3.44
MPa until the oil breakthrough. Once the oil breakthrough occurred,
the temporal pressure variation was performed between 3.44 and 2.41
MPa at intervals of 1 min, using a syringe pump. All set of experiments
were conducted at the room temperature of 23 ± 0.2 °C.

This section focuses on comparing the experimentally recovered
mass of oil with the model and commercial reservoir simulator (CMG)-predicted
value of oil production. The experiments consisted of five sequential
injections of different concentration polymer solutions in an initially
oil saturated medium. Based on the results obtained in Figure 2, it can be observed that the
oil recovery exhibits a declining trend upon increasing polymer solution
concentration at a maximum constant pressure of 3.44 MPa. It was also
observed that the polymer solution was seeped out of the physical
model prior to the oil recovery. The high injection pressure causes
the compactness of the pore spaces inside the porous media. This forms
a narrower path for the polymer solution to flow freely and leads
to the lower oil recovery. A higher concentration of the polymer solution
is directly proportional to the viscosity, and when these highly viscous
displacing fluids pass through the porous media, they exhibit a shear
thinning behavior due to the coil-stretched transitions of polymer
chains. These polymer chain coils deform when they pass through the narrow pore spaces and lose their
tendency to push more oil, resulting in poor sweep efficiency even
at the maximum constant pressure of 3.44 MPa. Additionally, the higher-concentration
solutions witnessed greater pressure drops during the flooding experiments
compared to the ones with lower viscosity. Higher pressure drops indicate
that there is greater resistance to flow due to an increase in the
apparent viscosity, above that expected compared to a purely viscous
fluid. This increase in flow resistance is referred to as an extension-thickening
effect. Furthermore, the glass beads (monodisperse) packed bed was
utilized in the flooding experiments. The level of heterogeneity in
the packed bed was very small, which led to a minimal oil recovery.
Even if the unequal heterogeneities would have been overcome, there
would still be an insignificant change in enhanced oil recovery. Final
cumulative oil production ranges from 41 to 29 g with polymer concentration
ranging from 1000 to 5000 ppm. Moreover, to scrutinize the cumulative
impact of periodic pressure variation with different concentrations
of polymer solutions, we performed experiments by injecting the polymeric
solution at different concentrations ranging between 1000 and 5000
ppm and with periodic variation of the solution injection pressure
between 2.41 and 3.44 MPa. The overall increase in heavy-oil recovery
with a periodic pressure variation may be attributed to the sudden
change in the injection pressure of the displacing fluid within the
physical reservoir model, resulting in altering the fluid velocity
as the polymer solution passes through the porous media. As the polymer
solution passes through the small pore areas, the velocity increases
due to the periodic variations, causing a decrease in the static pressure,
thereby leading to higher oil recovery. Furthermore, the periodic
pressure variation can give higher oil recoveries through the viscoelastic
effect. The flow of viscoelastic polymer through a packed bed can
exhibit a rapid increase in the pressure drop due to the increase
in apparent polymer viscosity. This increase in pressure drop has
been attributed to the extensional nature of polymer flow through
porous media caused by the successive expansions and contractions
in the flow channels. The periodic pressure variations caused sudden
expansion and contraction that the polymer chain experienced when
passed through the pore throats. The pressure pulses cause the polymer
to transfer the energy to the trapped oil and “snap”
the oil out of the pore throats, thereby leading to a better sweep
efficiency. It further creates increased pressure gradients within
the porous media that provides the necessary force to keep the portion
of the flow channel open, thereby leading to the incremental oil recovery.
The trends in the collected data indicated that cumulative oil recovery
can be improved by increasing the polymer concentration as well as
increasing the injection pressure of the polymer. In comparison to
the maximum constant pressure, periodic pressure variations enhanced
oil recovery more than 100% with a final value of 77–58 g with
polymer concentrations ranging from 1000 to 5000 ppm.

Figure 2 Comparison of experimental,
model-predicted, and numerically simulated
(commercial reservoir simulator, CMG) oil recoveries using 1000–5000
ppm polymer concentration solution at a constant injection pressure
of 3.44 MPa.

The computation was performed
for the physical model of 1.5 D with
respect to heavy oil. Equations 8–11 were solved simultaneously
at the (j) node corresponding to the z coordinate, to obtain the calculated mass of produced oil. Equations
were numerically integrated using adaptive step-size control, and
the analytical jacobians of the above-mentioned equations were employed
for integration. The algorithm was programmed to generate calculated
mass (mcalculated) at the experimental
time instants for a direct comparison with its experimental counterpart,
(mexperimental). The computational algorithm
was programmed in C++ interface and was executed on Itanium quad processor
(64 bit, 1.5 GHz, 15.9 GB of RAM). The input parameters used in the
extensive simulation study of the mathematical model of polymer flooding
are presented in Table 1. With the utilization of the listed parameter values in the mathematical
model, simulation profiles depicted that predicted oil production
follows experimental oil recovery very close during the operation
time of 18 min for a maximum constant pressure of 3.44 MPa as well
as with periodic pressure variations between 2.41 and 3.44 MPa by
varying FLOPAAM 3630s concentration in the range of 1000–5000
ppm. Root-mean-square error values were obtained by solving the scaled eqs 8–11 with various values of polymer solution concentration and
with different pressure magnitudes used in this study. Figure 2 effectively illustrates the
experimental and model-predicted cumulative mass of oil recovered
(g) with respect to time (min) at a maximum constant pressure of 3.44
MPa. It can be further analyzed that the root-mean-square error (RMSE)
was estimated to be in the range of 1.1683–1.318. In comparison,
the RMSE between the experimental and commercial reservoir simulator
(CMG) was calculated to be in the span of 1.51–2.36 at a constant
maximum pressure of 3.44 MPa. The close agreement between the experimental,
model-predicted, and CMG-predicted oil production values attests to
the accuracy of the pressure variations and increasing concentration
used in this work, as given in Table 2.

In contrast
to the constant injection pressure, it can be analyzed from Figures 3–7 that the oil production increased monotonically
from 40 g to the maximum of 77 g. The improvement was significant
with increasing polymer concentration and with periodic pressure variation
between 2.41 and 3.44 MPa. The deviation values (RMSE and % relative
error) are shown in Table 3, which corroborates the accuracy of prediction even with
periodic pressure variations. In these studies, the incremental oil
recoveries with periodic pressure variations may be attributed to
the sudden change in the injection pressure for a short time duration
(or blips) within the physical reservoir model. Each such blip in
pressure results in altering the fluid velocity as the polymer solution
passes through the porous media. Due to the periodic variations, the
velocity of the polymer solution increases as they pass through small
pore areas, which eventually gets reflected in a higher oil recovery.
Additionally, the periodic pressure variation can lead to higher oil
recovery through the viscoelastic effect or in the process of viscoelastic
polymer injection. The applicability of the proposed numerical model
was validated to ensure consistent numerical results before being
used to predict the oil production through comparison with core flooding
experiments. The system of discretized differential equations was
solved using the Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg explicit integration
technique with an improved error estimation of O(h5). For the accuracy and stability of this numerical method,
the time step was selected to be 0.5 s.32,33

to investigate the robustness of the prescribed mathematical model
in the presence of disparity in the magnitudes of the associated parameters.
The effect of implementing 5% variation in the magnitudes of permeability,
porosity, density, diffusion coefficient, and number of grid points
was analyzed at a time by keeping others constant with respect to
the original computation geometry. The basis for selecting these parameters
was invoked from the assumptions of considering permeability, porosity,
density, and diffusion coefficient constant while developing the mathematical
model. On the other hand, number of grid points for the simulation
study was adjusted from the user end with the objective of enhancing
the accuracy in simulation profile as well as minimizing the computation
time. Additionally, the perceptions of root-mean-square error (RMSE)
and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) served to aggregate the
magnitudes of the errors in predictions at different points of time.
RMSE was evaluated using the following formula  Similarly, MAPE was estimated using the following
relation  where Xobs,i = experimental values and Xmodel,i = model-predicted values
at the ith point of time. Table 3 depicts the impact of parameter variation
on model-predicted
final mass of oil and deviations in the simulation profile with respect
to theoretically calculated values of RMSE and MAPE.

For a +5%
deviation in permeability and porosity, there is no significant
change in the final value of the recovered mass, as Table 4 shows 0.805% deviation with
respect to the originally obtained mass compared to actual value under
the prevailing conditions of pressure and temperature. Similarly,
a −5% variation in density does not reflect major deviation
(0.1449%) in the final recovered mass. On the other hand, a −5%
variation in permeability, porosity, and diffusion coefficient and
a +5% deviation in density register relatively greater deviation with
respect to the final actual value of recovered mass; as the deviations
are within 15% of the original profile, the model can be considered
as highly applicable when simulated with respect to similar input
conditions. Therefore, it can be concluded that the mathematical model
is less sensitive toward the variations in the parameter values and
assumptions of treating the same as constant can be accepted with
a 95% confidence level.

It is also noteworthy that for all of the induced
perturbations,
the overall fitness of the model is quite impressive as all of these
cases register significantly low values of RMSE. For all of them,
estimated root-mean-square deviations are significantly less than
10, which essentially validates the suitability of the simulation
profile in real-time scaffold. Besides, all of these cases display
mean absolute percentage deviation less than 20%, which suffices the
suitability of the assumptions under existing state.

Contrarily,
a change in the number of grid points (with keeping
other parameters at their predefined values) heavily affects the simulation
profile. The accuracy of the simulation profile gets diminished as
it conveys higher magnitudes of RMSE (30 with 9 grid points and 14
with 7 grid points) and MAPE (91% with 9 grid points and 31% with
7 grid points). Additionally, it delineates a high deviation in the
final predicted value of mass of oil (73% with 9 grid points and 37%
with 7 grid points). Besides, high computation time and low prediction
accuracy in comparison to the experimental profile are recorded when
the simulation study is navigated with a higher number of grid points
(more than 12). Thus, the selection of eight grid points is quite
judicial in the context of deciphering the desired predictive modeling
framework with equitable computation time.

7 Conclusions
In this research endeavor, we proposed a mathematical model incorporating
coupled effects of polymer concentration on solution viscosity, permeability
reduction, and inaccessible pore volume to enhance heavy-oil production
in polymer flooding using constant and time-varying injection pressure
as well as solvent concentration. A numerical solution of this model
can be effectively employed to signify the flow of viscoelastic polymeric
solutions in porous media in a lab-scale setup. The proposed mathematical
model was able to tally experimentally obtained oil recovery using
(1000–5000 ppm) polymer concentration, maximum constant injection
pressure of 3.44 MPa, and with periodic pressure variations between
2.41 and 3.44 MPa. The model-predicted, maximized oil production yielded
by the computational algorithm displayed a root-mean-square error
(RMSE) in the range of 1.257–1.318 at a constant injection
pressure of 3.44 MPa. On the other hand, root-mean-square error with
periodic pressure variations was in the span of 1.381–2.375.
Additionally, we have also successfully verified the experimental
oil production with the commercial reservoir simulator (CMG) both
at maximum constant pressure and with temporal pressure variation.
Moreover, we performed a thorough sensitivity investigation using
the scaled numerical model on important input parameters such as permeability,
porosity, diffusion coefficient of polymer, number of grid points,
and heavy-oil density. The sensitivity results underscore the level
of uncertainty equitable for these input parameters and the overall
confidence in this mathematical model and simulation study. Numerical
results were extremely sensitive to the number of grid points along
the axial direction (z-direction). Overall, mathematical
model, computational algorithm, and simulation results indicate that
solvent injection pressure (maximum constant pressure and periodic
pressure variations between 2.41–3.44 MPa) has considerable
potential to enhance heavy-oil recovery in a laboratory-scale polymer
flooding project.
