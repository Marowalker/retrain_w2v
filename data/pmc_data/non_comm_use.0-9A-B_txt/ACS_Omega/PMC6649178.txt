Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been
of great interest because of
their unique electrical, structural, and mechanical properties. Many
methods for obtaining CNTs are known. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD)
has been recognized as the most popular and practical synthetic method
for obtaining CNTs, with high purity, high yield, and low cost. Catalyst
components are usually transient metals such as Fe, Co, and Ni, and
hydrocarbons are used as a feedstock for the CNT synthesis. The metal
particles are supported on the inorganic porous materials, such as
alumina (Al2O3), silica (SiO2), magnesia
(MgO), zeolite, and mesoporous silica. In this work, we propose a
new platform for the deposition of metal nanoparticles and the growth
of CTs. Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has gained much attention
in the material fields. The principal aim of the present work is to
compare the synergetic effect of MoS2 and CTs and to investigate
the possibility of using the material in various fields. The obtained
material was tested for its use in fire retardation. We compared the
effect of adding bulk MoS2 and MoS2/CTs into
the polymer matrix.

Introduction
The discovery of carbon
nanotubes (CNTs) in 1991 by Iijima has
stimulated intensive research to characterize their structure and
determine their properties both in fundamental science and in industrial
applications.1−5 On the basis of CNTs as active components, many potential applications
such as field emitters, nanoscale transistors, supercapacitors, and
sensors have been demonstrated. There are various mechanisms of CNT
growth. The popular mechanism includes four steps such as dissociation
of hydrocarbons, migration of carbon, segregation of carbon, and formation
of graphene sheets. The common characteristic of all mechanisms is
to provide energy to a carbon source for the creation of carbon atoms
that generate CNTs.6−10 There are several techniques that have been developed for fabricating
CNT structures, which mainly involve gas-phase processes. Most popular
procedures are being used for producing CNTs: the chemical vapor deposition
(CVD) technique, the laser ablation technique, and the carbon arc
discharge technique.11−13 A CVD method has been widely used for the synthesis
of nanotubes because carbon feedstock, such as hydrocarbon, can be
fed continuously into the reaction.14 This
is different from the other methods, which use carbon vapor evaporated
from metal-filled graphite rods and thus supply a limited amount of
amorphic carbon for nanotube growth. Moreover, the CVD growth can
be performed at a lower temperature (600–1000 °C) compared
with other methods, allowing nanotube growth.15−17

The structures
of nanoscale carbons formed by the CVD method strongly
depend on the kind of molecules because of their carbon sources as
well as the type of metal catalysts. Various types of catalysts are
used. These are used either in the form of an element or in the form
of a salt, which is supported on different inert materials.18−20 Different monometallic, bimetallic, and trimetallic catalytic compounds
with different supports, especially Fe/MgO, Ni/MgO, Mo/MgO, Co/MgO,
Fe/Al2O3, FeNi/MgO, FeZn/MgO, FeCo/MgO, CoNi/MgO, Mo Ni/MgO,
CoMo/MgO, CoNi/SiO2, FeCo/Al(OH)3, Fe CoMo/Al(OH)3, FeNiMo/Al(OH)3, and so forth, have been explored
for the production of CNTs. They produce different types of CNTs ranging
from single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs), double-walled nanotubes (DWNTs),
and multiwalled nanotubes (MWNTs).21−25

Another very important aspect of CNT growth
is the selection of
a suitable substrate for the deposition of catalyst particles. Different
materials such as magnesia (MgO), silica (SiO2), alumina
(Al2O3) zeolite, and mesoporous materials such
as MCM-41 have been studied.26−28 MgO support appears promising
as it provides a high yield of surface-clean SWNTs and DWNTs and is
easily removed by a simple acid treatment. Use of these materials
as a support for catalysts has a lot of disadvantages. Coquay demonstrated
that the MgO-supported catalysts are efficient for carbon nanotube
(SWNT and DWNT) synthesis, and MgO can be removed by an acid solution
such as hydrochloric acid. The disadvantage was that the CNTs prepared
by MgO-supported catalysts often contained carbon impurities, for
example, amorphic carbon, that cannot be removed by an acid treatment.
These impurities were caused by the existence of unwell dispersed
metal oxide species on the MgO-supported catalysts.29 Zhao obtained CNTs that were grown on the surface and edge
of graphene by CVD at 1000 °C. The isolated graphene lamellae
were connected by CNTs to form a spatial network structure of CNTs
that provides the effective electron transmission channels.30 Also, Dong obtained highly conductive graphene–CNT
hybrid materials that were synthesized on a Si NP-coated copper foil
by a one-step CVD method. This easy method provides a novel way to
obtain nanocarbon hybrids.31

In this
work, we present a new method by which CNTs and nanoparticles
were obtained from the decomposition products of Ni2O3 and Fe2O3 when the reaction
was performed over MoS2. A detailed study on the effect
of various metal oxides to growth of carbon tubes (CTs) upon the morphology
of the formed products and their properties has been discussed. The
synergistic effect of MoS2–support and CNTs was
investigated. Flame retardancy of polymeric materials is conducted
to provide fire protection to flammable consumer goods, as well as
to mitigate fire growth in a wide range of fires. This paper shows
new support for CNTs, which can be used in the commercial flame retardant
technology. Scheme 1 shows the preparation of a MoS2 platform for the growth
of CTs.

Experimental Section
Materials
1-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (anhydrous, 99.5%),
bulk MoS2 (powder), nickel(II) acetate tetrahydrate (98%),
iron(II) acetate (95%), and polyethylene (PE) (average Mw ≈ 4000 by GPC, average Mn ≈ 1700 by GPC) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Exfoliation of MoS2
The initial MoS2 concentration experiments were performed by adding 1 g of
powder to 10 mL of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) in
a 100 mL capacity, flat-bottomed beaker. The solution was sonicated
continuously for 72 h using a horn probe sonic tip. The beaker was
connected to a cooling system that allowed cold water (15 °C)
to flow around the dispersion during sonication. The final dispersion
was centrifugated four times at 1500 rpm.

Preparation of MoS2/Ni2O3 and
MoS2/Fe2O3
Two samples of
MoS2 modified by metal oxide nanoparticles (MoS2/Ni2O3 and MoS2/Fe2O3) were prepared according to the following procedure: 150
mg of MoS2 and 150 mg of nickel (II) acetate tetrahydrate
(product referred to as MoS2/Ni2O3) and iron(II) acetate (product referred to as MoS2/Fe2O3) were dispersed in 250 mL of ethanol and sonicated
for 2 h. Afterward, the mixture was stirred for another 24 h. Finally,
the sample was dried in high vacuum at 440 °C for 3 h.

Growth
of CTs
The simplest system to grow CTs by CVD
consists of catalyst nanoparticles brought to high temperature in
the presence of gaseous carbon-containing molecules. The nanoparticles
are commonly made of a transition metal such as Fe or Ni. The catalyst
particles are deposited in the last step on a support material. CVD
processes were performed in a quartz tube placed inside a tube furnace.
The process tubes were heated in air at 800 °C for 1 h prior
to both CVD and annealing. Ar and C2H4 were
used for CVD as a carrier gas and carbon source, respectively. In
a typical synthesis, 1 g of the sample was first placed on a ceramic
boat and inserted into the process tube. Samples were heated at 800
°C under a flow of 100 sccm of argon and at a given temperature
with a flow of 60 sccm of C2H4. After 15 min,
the ethylene was turned off and the system was cooled to room temperature.

Preparation of Composites
PE was used as a polymer
matrix. The contents of MoS2/Ni2O3, MoS2/Fe2O3, MoS2/CTs@Ni2O3, and MoS2/CTs@Fe2O3 are 1, 5, 3, 6, and 10 wt %, respectively. After being dried
at 70 °C for 12 h, MoS2 samples were blended with
PE using a two-screw extruder at a temperature of 120 °C.

Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried
out on a Philips diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM were performed on
a Tecnai F30 transmission electron microscope (FEI Corporation, USA)
at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Thermogravimetric analysis was
carried out using a SDT Q6000 thermoanalyzer instrument (TA Instruments
Inc.) under an air flow of 100 mL/min. In each case, the samples were
heated from room temperature to 900 °C at a linear heating rate
of 10 °C/min. The samples were measured in an alumina crucible
with a mass of about 5.0 mg. Raman spectroscopy was performed under
microscope mode using the following lengths of the laser: 785 nm (InVia
Renishaw). Raman spectroscopy is an ideal method to study the structural
properties of the nanomaterials. Atomic force microscopy (AFM NTEGRA
Aura (NT-MTD) microscope) determined the number of layers in the MoS2 samples. The polymer composites will be prepared via a standard
technique employing a laboratory twin-screw extruder (Zamak Mercator
EHP 2x12). It is widely used in polymer research and can be used to
prepare all kinds of polyolefin-flame-retardant nanocomposites. The
measurements of the flame retardancy will be realized via a micro
calorimeter (FAA MICRO Calorimeter).

Results and Discussion
The successful exfoliation of MoS2 with NMP was confirmed
by TEM and AFM. The morphologies of MoS2 nanosheets before
and after the sonication treatment were investigated by TEM. Figure 1A′,A″
shows the TEM images of bulk MoS2 large area stacked nanosheets.
After sonication (Figure 1B′,B″), the seriously stacked nanosheets of
bulk MoS2 were exfoliated to a thinner layered structure
observed by a lighter contrast. The dimensions of the flakes were
characterized by AFM imaging (Figure 1A,B). The AFM profiles exhibit a flat and uniform surface
without aggregation, an indication that homogeneously two-dimensional
flakes were obtained. It is noted that the exfoliated flakes produced
with NMP were typically 1.5–3.5 nm in height, which corresponds
to two to five layers of MoS2 (single layer thickness:
∼0.7 nm).32,33

and exfoliated MoS2 (B,B′,B″).

Exfoliation of the new material MoS2 into few layers
largely preserves their properties and also leads to additional characteristics
because of confinement effects. The MoS2 exfoliation experiments
were performed by adding the powder to NMP in a flat-bottomed flask.
These mixtures were sonicated continuously for 72 h using a horn probe
sonication tip. The flask was connected to a cooling system that will
allow cold water (15 °C) to flow around the dispersion during
sonication. After sonication, the suspensions were centrifuged with
a defined speed to control the number of layers in the final MoS2 sample. The solvent was filtered from the sample before the
analysis. Raman spectroscopy (Figure 2) has been used to determine the number of layers,
as well as to examine the changes in material properties with thickness.
This is commonly accompanied by a change in the intensity of these
peaks, which has also been observed for the investigated samples of
this study. The Raman spectra were excited by a 785 nm line in an
air ambient environment. E2g1 (∼380 cm–1 for bulk
MoS2) and A1g (∼406 cm–1 for bulk MoS2) modes are observed in both exfoliated
and bulk MoS2. It is proved that the frequency of the E2g1 peak decreases
while that of the Ag1 peak increases with an increasing layer number. When the
number of layers changes, the interlayer van der Waals force in MoS2 suppresses the atom vibration, resulting in higher force
constants.34,35

and exfoliated MoS2 (B).

In the next step, the samples of MoS2 were modified
by metal oxide nanoparticles (Ni2O3 and Fe2O3). The obtained samples were investigated using
TEM. Figure 3 shows
typical TEM images of the metal oxide nanoparticles supported on the
MoS2 surface. The nanoparticles are highly dispersed on
the MoS2 surface and deposited homogeneously. The detailed
TEM analysis of the Ni2O3 samples allowed us
to reveal the diameter distribution of the samples. It is noted that
the diameter of Fe2O3 nanoparticles (Figure 3A,A′) are
centered at 2–5 nm and that of Ni2O3 nanoparticles
(Figure 3B,B′)
are centered at 10–13 nm.

To confirm the crystal-phase composition of metal nanoparticles
supported on MoS2, XRD analysis was used. Figure 4A,B shows representative data
for MoS2/Fe2O3 and MoS2/Ni2O3, respectively. All sharp diffraction
peaks (red cubes) were detected at 2θ ≅ 14, 33, 40, 44°
corresponding to MoS2. A few strong XRD peaks in Figure 4A (blue cubes) are
attributed to Fe2O3. All these diffraction peaks
are in good agreement with that of the standard pattern for rhombohedral
α-Fe2O3.36 The
second major peak shown in Figure 1B at 2θ ≅ 50, 56° is typical for
Ni2O3. The characteristic peaks for Ni 2θ
≅ 58, 73, 76° and NiO2 2θ ≅ 36,
61° are observed.

and MoS2/CTs@Ni2O3 (B,B′,B″)
and diameter distribution of MoS2/CTs@Fe3O4 (A‴) and MoS2/CTs@Ni2O3 (B‴).

The as-prepared MoS2 substrates with metal oxides were
used in the CVD process for CT growth. The morphology of the samples
was also determined by TEM (Figure 5). The TEM images of MoS2 with Fe2O3 and Ni2O3 after CVD clearly show
tubular structures, indicating the activity of the catalysts. The
analysis of the images allows us to calculate the diameter distribution
of the tubes in both samples. We studied that the size of the original
iron and nickel oxide nanoparticles become bigger during CVD, which
resulted in the growth of CNTs with larger diameter when reacted with
ethylene. Additionally, the samples do not contain undesired carbon
impurities such as amorphous carbon or graphitic nanoparticles, which
are typically present when other supports are applied. The increase
in the particles size is clearly due to the weak interaction between
the catalysts and the MoS2 support (Figure 6A,B). It reflects strongly limited thermal
diffusion of metal atoms into the support matrix. This observation
is opposite to the interaction between the catalysts and MgO. Here,
the strong metal–support interaction yields in a smaller diameter
of the catalysts and a smaller mean diameter of the grown tubes. It
was found that the original iron particles became smaller during CVD
and that these small particles resulted in SWNTs and DWNTs when reacted
with methane.37 In these cases, we proposed
the root growth mechanism. When the catalyst–support interaction
is strong, hydrocarbon decomposes on the top surface of the metal,
carbon diffuses down through the metal, and the CT precipitation fails
to push the metal particle upward. Next, hydrocarbon decomposition
takes place on the lower peripheral surface of the metal, and the
as-dissolved carbon diffuses upward. Thus, CTs grow up with the catalyst
rooted on the support.38

distribution of Fe2O3 (A′,B′)
Ni2O3 after annealing
at 800 °C, and (C) proposed mechanism of the CT formation catalysts
supported on MoS2.

Also, the CNTs prepared by MgO–support catalysts often
contain
carbon impurities, such as carbon nanofibers, amorphic carbon that
cannot be easily removed by an acid treatment. These disadvantages
are caused by the existence of unwell dispersed metal oxide on the
MgO–support catalysts. This is not a case when MoS2 is applied.36,37

Conclusions
The
catalytic performance of Ni2O3, Fe2O3 catalysts supported on MoS2 for the
formation of CNTs through ethylene decomposition was investigated.
A weak metal–support interaction has been revealed, which led
to an increase in the diameter of CTs. Interestingly, the samples
do not contain unwanted carbon impurities such as amorphous carbon
or graphitic nanoparticles, which are typically present when other
supports are applied. Mutual synergy between MoS2, catalyst,
and CTs resulted in better thermal response compared to PE/MoS2 composites. Better values of pHRR, THR, and HR capacity were
obtained for the samples of MoS2/CTs@Fe3O4 and MoS2/CTs@Ni2O3 compared
to pristine polymer, polymer with MoS2, or with MoS2 with metal particles. Therefore, we prove that the as-produced
samples are useful for certain applications and no additional steps,
including purification, are required prior utilization.
