In this article, we have investigated
the excited-state intramolecular
double proton transfer dynamics of [2,2′-bipyridyl]-3,3′-diol,
BP(OH)2, in three alcohol–water binary mixtures,
namely, ethanol (EtOH)–water, n-propanol (PrOH)–water, tert-butyl alcohol (TBA)–water, and dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO)–water utilizing the femtosecond fluorescence upconversion
technique. We have found that in alcohol–water binary mixtures
the proton transfer (PT) pathway of BP(OH)2 is sequential
and the anomalous slowdown in PT dynamics is observed in mole fraction
(χ) ranges χEtOH = 0.04–0.07, χEtOH = 0.23–0.28, χPrOH = 0.17–0.30,
χTBA = 0.12–0.21, and χTBA = 0.40–0.46. Our study sheds light on the involvement of
water network in the PT dynamics. Reduction in water accessibility
due to the involvement of water molecules in cluster formation results
in hindered PT dynamics, and this retardation is more for the TBA–water
binary mixture compared to that for the other two mixtures. Additionally,
we have found two anomalous regions for the DMSO–water binary
mixture in ranges χDMSO = 0.12–0.16 and χDMSO = 0.26–0.34. However, most interestingly, beyond
χDMSO = 0.40, we do not find any growth component
in the femtosecond fluorescence upconversion trace, which may be due
to the change in the PT mechanism from a sequential water-mediated
pathway to a concerted intramolecular pathway.

1 Introduction
Photoinduced
excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT)
reactions have received widespread interest in the field of chemistry
and biology1 as they have potential applications
in molecular probes,2 white-light-emitting
diodes,3,4 photostabilizers, logic gates, bioimaging,5 etc. Various ESIPT fluorophores are studied in
different solvents, and they provide the conformation of the proteins
and the polarity of their binding sites.6−8 Among the ESIPT probes,
[2,2′-bipyridyl]-3,3′-diol, BP(OH)2, is a
very well studied lasing dye with a planar structure.9,10 In 1983, Bulska has reported, for the first time, that upon photoexcitation
BP(OH)2 exhibits the excited-state intramolecular double
proton transfer (ESIDPT) phenomenon following both the synchronous
and stepwise mechanisms.11 In the ground
state, BP(OH)2 exists only in the dienol (DE) form, and
in the excited state depending upon the stepwise or concerted PT pathway,
either monoketo (MK) or diketo (DK) forms can be present, respectively.
A series of theoretical12,13 and experimental14−16 studies reveal the parallel involvement of both the PT pathways
in this molecular system. Transient absorption, electro-optical emission,
and femtosecond fluorescence upconversion studies14−20 also infer the coexistence of two PT channels. The structures of
different tautomers of BP(OH)2 and the different PT time
scales are delineated in Scheme 1.16,21 The photophysics and PT dynamics
of this probe have been extensively investigated in different confined
microenvironments, such as micelles,21−23 vesicles,23,24 cyclodextrins,25 cucurbiturils,26 bile salt aggregates,27 nafion membranes,28 proteins,25 and binary mixtures,29,30 and found to be very sensitive to the heterogeneous environments.

Scheme 1 Structures of Different Tautomers of BP(OH)2 Involved
in Two Different ESIDPT Pathways: Stepwise and Concerted
Although there are a huge number
of theoretical31−43 and experimental44−52 studies, the interest regarding the aqueous solution of alcohols
is continuously increasing. Particularly, a delicate balance of different
intermolecular interactions between amphiphilic alcohol and hydrophilic
water molecules drives the binary mixtures to exhibit a range of striking
anomalies. The binary mixtures show nonideal behavior in various properties
such as partial molar volume,53 density,44,54 surface tension,55 viscosity,32,55 excess entropy of mixing,56 excess free
energy of mixing,56 ultrasonic absorption,57 etc. Alcohols are amphiphilic molecules having
a hydrophobic alkyl chain and a hydrophilic hydroxyl (−OH)
group, and their miscibility in water is reduced with an increase
in the hydrophobic chain length; in reality, tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) is the largest alcohol, which is entirely miscible
in water at all proportions but shows deviation from ideal behavior.
With increase in the size of alcohols, alcohol–alcohol interactions
become dominant over alcohol–water interactions.58 Wakisaka et al. have analyzed the mass spectra
of alcohol (ethanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol)–water binary mixtures
and found that 1-butanol clusters are less hydrated and more heterogeneous
compared to the other two alcohol clusters.59 Matsuura and co-workers have reported that a small amount of water
enhances the self-association of alcohols.60 Very recently, Das et al. have used terahertz (THz) time-domain
spectroscopy to study nonmonotonic hydration behavior of bovine serum
albumin in different alcohol–water binary mixtures.61

Interestingly, the aqueous solution of
TBA exhibits significant
microheterogeneity and solute aggregation compared to the other homologous
alcohols because of higher hydrophobicity at a low concentration range.36,38,52 An isotopic substitution with
the neutron diffraction technique provides a better understanding
of TBA–water binary mixtures, and it interprets the dominance
of the nonpolar alkyl group of TBA rather than that of the polar hydroxyl
group in the formation of the intermolecular association.51 However, Dixit et al. opposes the dominance
of the hydrophobic effect of the alkyl chain and proposes the more
pronounced effect of polar interaction between water and alcohol.34 Therefore, the literature reports are presenting
a conflicting message and making the alcohol–water binary mixtures,
particularly the TBA–water mixture, more interesting to investigate.
However, with the increase in TBA concentration, a tetrahedral network
structure gradually transforms to a zigzag chainlike structure and
enhances the compressibility of the solution.45,62 Although n-propanol is soluble in water at all
proportions over a wide temperature range, the n-propanol–water
binary mixture shows very nonideal behavior. Shirota et al. have reported
that the abnormal behavior of n-propanol arises from
the effect of preferential solvation due to the clustering of n-propanol.46 The ethanol–water
binary mixture exhibits a strong deviation from the theoretical prediction
of different physicochemical properties (surface tension, viscosity,
density, and refractive index) and promotes the necessity for investigating
this binary mixture.

Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is an amphiphilic
molecule with two hydrophobic
methyl groups (−CH3) and a polar >S=O
group.
This polar group forms intermolecular hydrogen bonds with water, and
the hydrophobic methyl groups co-operatively aggregate through hydrophobic
interactions. Similar to the alcohols, DMSO shows abnormalities in
different physical properties, such as density, viscosity, dielectric
constant, heat of formation, excess mixing volume, etc.63−66 According to Borin et al., the 1DMSO/2H2O complex dominates
in the water-rich region, whereas the 2DMSO/1H2O complex
dominates in the water-poor region of the DMSO–water binary
mixture.67,68 Very recently, Baiz and co-workers have
found three distinct regions for the DMSO–water binary mixture
and proposed that the involvement of hydrogen-bonding interaction
between DMSO aggregate species and water is mainly responsible for
this observation.69

Herein, we have
investigated the composition-dependent PT dynamics
of BP(OH)2 in ethanol–water, n-propanol–water, tert-butyl alcohol (TBA)–water, and DMSO–water
binary mixtures utilizing the femtosecond fluorescence upconversion
technique. At different mole fractions of binary mixtures, the water
availability changes due to cluster formation, and it can strongly
guide the PT pathway. Here, our main focus is to monitor the actual
PT pathway of BP(OH)2 at different mole fractions of binary
mixtures. Our results indicate that PT from a MK to a DK tautomer
is unusually slowed down for the following alcohol mole fractions:
χEtOH = 0.04–0.07, χEtOH =
0.23–0.28, χPrOH = 0.17–0.30, χTBA = 0.12–0.21, and χTBA = 0.40–0.46.
However, very interestingly, beyond χDMSO = 0.40,
we have observed a decay in the femtosecond upconversion traces instead
of a growth component, which indicates that probably the PT is taking
place in a synchronous and intramolecular pathway instead of a two-step
water-mediated pathway from this mole fraction.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Steady-State Measurements
2.1.1 Absorption Study
There are extensive
literature reports on the PT dynamics of BP(OH)2 in different
solvents of varying polarity and hydrogen-bonding ability.10 In water, BP(OH)2 shows two absorption
peaks. The absorption band at around 345 nm is attributed to the nonpolar
DE tautomer of BP(OH)2 in the ground state and originates
due to the 1(π–π*) transition, and the
additional unique second band appears at a relatively lower-energy
region (∼400–430 nm) due to the proton-transferred DK
form of BP(OH)2, which is solvated through intermolecular
hydrogen bonding with water.21,23,28,30 Both the DE and DK forms of BP(OH)2 have symmetric structures; therefore, in both the ground
and excited states, it shows a negligible or ∼zero dipole moment.
As a result, the absorption peak maxima are slightly affected by the
change in the solvent polarity.9,18 On the other hand,
the MK form lacks the symmetric structure and shows a significant
amount of dipole moment (4.0–4.9 D).18

The UV–vis absorption spectra of BP(OH)2 in the ethanol–water binary mixture at different mole fractions
(from 0 to 1) are shown in Figure 1a. With an increase in the mole fraction of ethanol,
the intensity of the absorption peak at ∼345 nm increases with
a concomitant decrease in the intensity of the absorption band at
∼400–430 nm, and in both the cases, the absorption peak
maxima remain almost unaltered as both the DE and DK forms are nonpolar
and hardly affected by solvent polarity. This increase in absorbance
of the DE peak at the expense of the DK peak clearly indicates the
change in the polarity and the hydrogen-bonding capability of the
medium. The increase in the ethanol content reduces the polarity and
enhances the hydrophobicity of the medium and thus the stability of
the DK tautomer in the ground state is decreased and subsequently
the stability of the nonpolar DE form and its absorbance at ∼345
nm are enhanced. Ethanol forms stronger intermolecular hydrogen bonds
with water and thus diminishes the water accessibility around the
DK tautomer as well as its stability in the ground state, and as a
result, the 400–430 nm absorption band is decreased with ethanol
addition. Unlike water, ethanol cannot stabilize the polar centers
of the DK form of BP(OH)2 through short-range intermolecular
hydrogen-bonding interactions.10 Therefore,
the lower-energy red-shifted absorption band (∼400–430
nm) acts as the water sensor.30 Similar
to the ethanol–water binary mixture, for the other two alcohol
(n-propanol and TBA)–water binary mixtures
and the DMSO–water mixture, the increment of alcohol or DMSO
concentration enhances the absorbance for the DE form and reduces
for the DK form, as shown in Figure 1b–d, respectively. The presence of a distinct
isosbestic point at 370 nm for all of the four binary mixtures clearly
indicates that the two tautomeric forms of BP(OH)2, i.e.,
DE and DK forms, are in equilibrium with each other.

of alcohol or DMSO.

2.1.2 Emission
Study
BP(OH)2 exhibits an intense, sharp, structureless
emission peak with green
fluorescence at around ∼465 nm in aqueous solution. This emission
peak appears irrespective of the excitation wavelength and can be
attributed to the presence of single emissive species i.e., the proton-transferred
DK form of BP(OH)2. Excitation at 345 nm predominately
excites the DE form of BP(OH)2 to produce DE*, which subsequently
undergoes the ESIDPT process either in a stepwise or concerted pathway
to generate the DK* form, and this form gives large Stokes-shifted
emission at around ∼465 nm. For the stepwise PT pathway, DE*
gets converted to the DK* form via an intermediate MK* form, and in
both the PT channels (stepwise and concerted), the DE tautomer acts
as the precursor of the solely emissive DK form. However, with an
increase in the alcohol or DMSO content, the emission peak shows an
enhancement of the fluorescence intensity with the gradual bathochromic
shift. This red shift in the emission profile at a higher mole fraction
of alcohol or DMSO is the indication of a decrease in the polarity
of the medium and the sufficient perturbation in the intermolecular
hydrogen-bonding interaction between water and the DK tautomer.10,21 The emission spectra of BP(OH)2 (λex = 345 nm) in the ethanol–water binary mixture are shown in Figure 2a. Ethanol addition
shifts the emission maxima of BP(OH)2 to the higher wavelength
side. A similar trend in the enhancement of fluorescence intensity
and a bathochromic shift in fluorescence peak maxima is also observed
for n-propanol–water, TBA–water, and
DMSO–water binary mixtures for excitation at 345 nm and is
depicted in Figure 2b–d, respectively. As we have mentioned earlier that the emission
peak of the DK tautomer, at 465 nm, is independent of the excitation
wavelength, we have excited the fluorophore at 405 nm and the emission
spectra are shown in Figure S1a–d (Supporting Information). Here, we have noticed that with the increment
of the alcohol or DMSO mole fraction, the fluorescence intensity is
gradually decreased, i.e., a completely reverse trend is observed
compared to that of excitation at 345 nm. Therefore, the enhancement
of the fluorescence intensity of the DK form by exciting the DE form
at λex = 345 nm and reduction of the intensity of
the DK form by exciting the DK form at λex = 405
nm clearly suggest that the increased alcohol content makes the medium
less polar and more hydrophobic and converts the DK form more toward
the DE form, and it is reflected in the emission profiles shown in Figures 2 and S1. We have also collected the excitation spectra
at the respective emission maxima for different mole fractions of
binary mixtures for all of the four binary mixtures and are depicted
in Figure S2. Excitation spectra are showing
a similar trend to that of absorption spectra i.e., the fluorescence
intensity at 345 nm (DE form) increases and at 400–430 nm (DK
form) decreases with the gradual addition of alcohol or DMSO in water.
Therefore, the steady-state absorption, emission (λex = 345 and 405 nm), and excitation spectra are well-correlated with
each other and provide a conclusion similar to that reported by the
Zied group in different hydrophobic environments of protein, cyclodextrins,
etc.10 We have performed our study in aqueous
medium; here, only one emissive species, i.e., the DK form of BP(OH)2, is present and it fluoresces at around ∼465 nm. However,
at basic pH (∼11.7), BP(OH)2 mainly exists as [BP(OH)O]− (monoanion, MA) and [BPO2]2– (dianion, DA). In the emission spectra of BP(OH)2, at
this pH, the emission maximum is observed at 500 nm and a shoulder
is also observed at 425 nm, which indicates the formation of the DA,
[BPO2]2–.23

fractions of alcohol or DMSO.

2.2 Fluorescence Quantum Yield (ϕ) Measurement
The change in fluorescence quantum yields of BP(OH)2 in three different alcohol–water binary mixtures and in the
DMSO–water binary mixture as a function of alcohol or DMSO
mole fraction is shown in Figure 3. It is already reported39,45,52 that the ethanol–water binary mixture shows
anomalous behavior in different physical property measurements in
two mole fraction regions, one at around χEtOH =
0.06–0.09 and the other one is in the region of χEtOH = 0.20–0.30, and our quantum yield measurements
also reveal these two anomalous regions and are shown in Figure 3a. Shirota et al.46 have reported that the anomalous region for
the n-propanol–water binary mixture is at
around χPrOH = 0.15–0.25, and the quantum
yield measurement for BP(OH)2 also re-establishes this
mole fraction domain, as shown in Figure 3b. For the TBA–water binary mixture,
we have obtained maximum quantum yields at around χTBA = 0.09–0.15 and χTBA = 0.40–0.46
and are shown in Figure 3c. These results are also strongly supported by the literature reports.45,47,52,70 The fluorescence quantum yield is maximum for χDMSO = 0.12, and after this mole fraction, it again starts to fall down
with an increase in the DMSO content as the hydrophobicity of the
medium is decreased30 and is shown in Figure 3d. In the above-mentioned
mole fraction regions, because of cluster formation or chainlike connectivity
formation, hydrophobicity of the mixed solvent increases rapidly.34,39,46 Therefore, in these regions,
the microenvironment surrounding probe molecule BP(OH)2 becomes hydrophobic. Moreover, the diketo (DK) form of BP(OH)2 has nearly zero dipole moment as it has a symmetric structure
and thus it behaves as a nonpolar molecule.9,18 Literature
reports10,25,30 suggest that
when a fluorophore is confined inside nanocavities, its fluorescence
quantum yield increases, and here also, because of the same reason,
the fluorescence quantum yield increases as the nonpolar DK form of
BP(OH)2 experiences a more hydrophobic microenvironment.

for (d) DMSO/water.

2.3 Time-Resolved
Studies
2.3.1 Femtosecond Fluorescence Upconversion Measurement
Different dynamical studies such as solvation, rotation, intramolecular
charge transfer reaction, etc. of different fluorophores have been
carried out in different alcohol–water and DMSO–water
binary mixtures.46,47,52,71 Solvation and rotational dynamics of the
Coumarin 480 (C480) fluorophore in TBA–water and ethanol–water
binary mixtures have been investigated by our group using a femtosecond
fluorescence upconversion technique.52,71 Hazra and
co-workers have studied the ESIDPT dynamics of BP(OH)2 in
water, in different micellar aggregates,21 and inside different molecular containers26 utilizing the femtosecond fluorescence upconversion method. We have
performed our femtosecond fluorescence upconversion study providing
a higher number of scans and very small time intervals (to get more
number of data points) to obtain a smooth trace to get the growth
component for PT dynamics of BP(OH)2 in pure water. We
have found very small growth components (afast = −0.02, τfast = 3 ± 0.5) each time
and are given in Table 1 and Figure S3. When, very small amount
of alcohol/DMSO is added, the contribution of the growth component
increases (afast = −0.06 for ethanol, afast = −0.15 for n-propanol,
and afast = −0.14 for DMSO). τfast remains almost constant for ethanol, n-propanol, and DMSO, whereas increment occurs after TBA addition
as the PT dynamics of BP(OH)2 is water-mediated and slowed
down in the presence of alcohol/DMSO. However, the ESIPT dynamics
of BP(OH)2 in alcohol–water and DMSO–water
systems has not been studied yet. We have mentioned earlier that the
PT from the DE form of BP(OH)2 can take place either in
a concerted or stepwise pathway depending upon the microenvironment15,16,26 and generates a DK form where
the two hydroxyl (−OH) protons move toward the nitrogen atoms
of the pyridyl ring.16 Moreover, PT may
occur through an intramolecular pathway as well as a water-mediated
intermolecular pathway. Therefore, cluster formation and change in
the water availability at different mole fractions of the binary mixture
can strongly influence the PT pathway. In this study, our main interest
is to follow the actual PT pathway of BP(OH)2 in different
mole fractions of binary mixtures. In the concerted mechanism, double
proton transfer (DPT) takes place in the ultrafast time scale (≤100
fs) following a (quasi-)barrierless pathway to produce a DK form directly
from a DE tautomer.16 On the other hand,
for the stepwise pathway, in the first step, the MK tautomer generates
from the DE form instantaneously (≤100 fs) via a single proton
transfer pathway (SPT) and in the subsequent step, the MK tautomer
eventually evolves into the DK tautomer in a relatively slower time
scale (≥10 ps) as there is appreciable energy barrier. As the
concerted DPT to form the DK tautomer and the stepwise SPT to form
the MK tautomer both take place in a typical ultrafast time scale
(≤100 fs),16 we cannot monitor these
processes in our femtosecond fluorescence upconversion setup of full
width at half-maxima ∼250 fs. Therefore, in this study, we
have monitored the sequential PT mechanism and the MK-to-DK tautomer
conversion through the SPT pathway, which occurs in a relatively slower
time scale (∼10 ps) and depends upon the excitation wavelength
and solvents.15,16 Concerted and sequential DPT
reactions are promoted by stretching and bending skeletal modes of
vibration of BP(OH)2, respectively.19

We have performed a femtosecond fluorescence upconversion study
of BP(OH)2 for three alcohol (ethanol, n-propanol, and TBA)–water binary mixtures and also for a DMSO–water
mixture, and the fluorescence upconverted decay profiles display a
growth component followed by a decay component. This growth component
represents the PT dynamics from the MK form to the DK form of BP(OH)2, and the decay denotes the lifetime of the DK tautomer. The
lifetimes of growth and decay components are represented as τfast and τslow, respectively. Both the dienol
(DE) and diketo (DK) forms of BP(OH)2 have almost zero
dipole moment both in the ground state and in the excited state as
they have a symmetrical structure. Therefore, BP(OH)2 should
not show any solvation dynamics. Moreover, Datta and co-workers72 have revealed that BP(OH)2 is not
a solvation probe as the major band in the time-resolved emission
spectra generated using the fitted parameters does not undergo a very
prominent shift. Therefore, the solvation dynamics is not contributing
to our spectral dynamics.

We have recorded the fluorescence
emission spectra of BP(OH)2 at three different excitation
wavelengths, i.e., λex = 345, 370, and 405 nm, shown
in Figure S4. In all of the three excitations, we have obtained the same
emission maxima. Therefore, the emission is taking place from only
one species i.e., the diketo (DK) form. Thus, femtosecond upconversion
traces can be obtained for only the diketo (DK) tautomer whether we
excite at 345 or 405 nm. However, Glasbeek and co-workers17,19 have reported that with an increase in the excitation wavelength
of BP(OH)2 the yield of the stepwise double proton transfer
process decreases. Therefore, to avoid the isosbestic point (at 370
nm), if we excite the sample at a higher wavelength, i.e., ≥380
nm, then the efficiency of the stepwise PT process will be highly
reduced. However, the PT through this two-step pathway in different
aqueous binary mixtures is our main focus in this study. On the other
hand, excitation of BP(OH)2 at the lower wavelength region
might cause photodegradation of the sample, which will provide an
erroneous result. Therefore, to get a higher efficiency of the two-step
pathway and to avoid the photodegradation of BP(OH)2, we
have chosen 380 nm as the excitation wavelength. Moreover, the studies
of Hazra and co-workers21,26 provide additional
support in choosing 380 nm to excite BP(OH)2.

The
femtosecond fluorescence kinetics is taken at the respective
emission maxima by exciting the sample at 380 nm, and the femtosecond
traces are deconvoluted using a Gaussian-shaped instrument response
function (IRF) by Labview software using a biexponential function.
The full set of fluorescence upconversion traces (i.e., up to 2100
ps with the time interval of 500 ps) for all of the four binary mixtures,
namely, EtOH–water, n-PrOH–water, TBA–water,
and DMSO–water, are shown in Figures S5–S8, respectively. We have also fitted the data taking the short time
range, i.e., up to 300 ps, and the fitted data are providing similar values to those of the full
range, i.e., up to 2100 ps. However, for a better comparison of the
rise component of the fluorescence upconversion traces of BP(OH)2 at different mole fractions for different binary mixtures,
we have shown the fluorescence upconversion traces up to 25 ps in Figure 4.

kinetics is taken at the respective emission maxima (ranging from

2.3.1.1 Ethanol–Water Binary Mixture
Bagchi and co-workers39 have performed
computer simulation and theoretical analyses and proposed that a sudden
emergence of a bicontinuous phase is the reason behind the low mole
fraction anomaly of ethanol, χEtOH ∼ 0.06–0.10.
They have proposed that in the absence of ethanol, water mainly remains
as the hydrogen-bonded cluster and at χEtOH ∼
0.06–0.10 ethanol clusters start to form and an unexpected
microheterogeneity generates in the medium. Hydrophobic hydration
of the ethyl groups and the hydrophilic interaction between water
and −OH groups of ethanol are responsible for the ethanol cluster
formation. Therefore, a percolation-like transition guides to form
the bicontinuous phase and generates the anomaly in the binary mixture.
Our results also corroborate the similar observation as we have found
the anomaly in PT dynamics in the χEtOH = 0.04–0.07
region. For the ethanol–water binary mixture, with the increase
in the mole fraction of ethanol (χEtOH), there is
a sharp increase in the τfast value from ∼2
to ∼6.5 ps in the χEtOH = 0.04–0.07
region. Another rise in the τfast value from ∼7.7
to ∼16 ps is found for χEtOH = 0.23–0.28.
The normalized fluorescence upconversion traces of BP(OH)2 in the ethanol–water binary mixture are shown in Figure 4a, and the corresponding
decay parameters are depicted in Table S1 (Supporting Information). The change in τfast as
a function of χEtOH is depicted in Figure 5a, which clearly reveals two
distinct anomalous regions (χEtOH = 0.04–0.07
and χEtOH = 0.23–0.28) of the mixture where
τfast has a relatively larger value, i.e., PT dynamics
is sluggish.

2.3.1.2 n-Propanol–Water
Binary Mixture
For the water-poor region of the n-propanol–water binary mixture, water molecules remain dispersed
in the organic phase instead of forming separate clusters. However,
at a higher water content, water molecules interact with the −OH
groups of the alcohols and form clusters. For the n-propanol–water binary mixture, the maximum viscosity appears
at around ∼χPrOH = 0.30 and cluster formation
is mainly responsible for this anomalous behavior in viscosity.46 However, small-angle X-ray scattering study73 infers that the nonideal region of the n-propanol–water binary mixture lies in between χPrOH = 0.15 and 0.25. Mashimo et al. have also studied this
mixture and obtained a turning point at χPrOH = 0.17
in the dielectric relaxation time versus χPrOH plot
and proposed this as the critical composition where the hydrogen-bonded
tetrahedral structure breaks down.74 The
large-angle X-ray scattering study of the n-propanol–water
binary mixture proposes that the tetrahedral-like structure of water
dominates at χPrOH < 0.1, whereas in the 0.1 <
χPrOH < 0.7 region, both the n-propanol chain and water clusters coexist and at the χPrOH > 0.7 region, the n-propanol chain
cluster
prevails.75 For the n-propanol–water
binary mixture, with the increase in the mole fraction of n-propanol (χPrOH), the value of τfast increases, indicating the slow PT dynamics. Normalized
fluorescence upconversion traces and the corresponding decay parameters
of BP(OH)2 in the n-propanol–water
binary mixture are shown in Figure 4b and Table S2, respectively.
Interestingly, for χPrOH = 0.17–0.30, τfast is almost constant (∼12 ps), i.e., PT dynamics
becomes independent of the n-propanol concentration,
and is shown in the plot of τfast versus χPrOH in Figure 5b. Shirota et al. have also reported a similar observation of solvation
dynamics of a hydrophobic Coumarin dye in the χPrOH = 0.15–0.25 range.46 Beyond χPrOH = 0.30, the value of τfast is gradually
increasing, which may be due to the cluster formation at the higher
mole fraction of n-propanol, which dominates over
the viscosity.

2.3.1.3 TBA–Water Binary
Mixture
There are several literature reports which propose
that at around
χTBA = 0.10 the tetrahedral network structure gradually
transforms to a zigzag chainlike structure.36,45,47 Iijima and co-workers have reported that
in the χTBA = 0.14–0.17 range the aggregation
tendency of TBA is maximum.70 Normalized
fluorescence upconversion traces and the corresponding decay parameters
of BP(OH)2 in TBA–water binary mixtures are shown
in Figure 4c and Table 1, respectively. Compared
to that in ethanol and n-propanol, the PT dynamics
is strongly retarded in TBA–water, and this is reflected in
the higher τfast value. In Figure 5c, two regions are found, χTBA = 0.12–0.21 and χTBA = 0.40–0.46,
and the τfast values are in the range of ∼28
and 42–50 ps, respectively. In our experiment, in the χTBA = 0.12–0.21 region, there is almost no change (τfast ∼ 28 ps) in the proton transfer (PT) dynamics,
whereas for χTBA = 0–0.11, there is ∼20
ps (for χTBA = 0, τfast ∼
3 ps; for χTBA = 0.11, τfast ∼
24 ps) change. Therefore, in this region proton transfer dynamics
is insensitive toward the mole fraction of TBA and anomaly is present
in the χTBA = 0.12–0.21 region, as reported
by Shirota and co-workers for the n-propanol–water
binary mixture.46

2.3.1.4 DMSO–Water Binary Mixture
X-ray diffraction
and inelastic neutron scattering experiments suggest
that at a low mole fraction of DMSO, the water structure becomes rigid
because of the hydrophobic hydration of the methyl groups. However,
at a higher DMSO mole fraction, a highly stable water–DMSO
complex forms as the S=O group breaks the hydrogen-bonding
network of water.76 Our group has reported
two anomalous regions of the DMSO–water binary mixture (χDMSO = 0.12–0.17 and χDMSO = 0.27–0.35)
by performing solvation dynamics of Coumarin 480.71 Bagchi and co-workers have performed a computer simulation
study, and they have concluded the low-mole-fraction anomaly for the
DMSO–water binary mixture in the χDMSO = 0.12–0.16
region. In this mole fraction region, the hydrophobicity of the mixture
increases as the methyl groups of the two DMSO molecules participate
to form a chainlike network.77−79 However, the second region, i.e.,
χDMSO = 0.12–0.17, is controlled by the shear
viscosity of the medium.71 Bagchi and co-workers
have proposed that at very low DMSO content (<10%) small aggregates
of DMSO are solvated by water through DMSO–(H2O)2 complex formation. At a relatively higher DMSO (10–12%)
content, spanning clusters are formed through the hydrogen-bonding
interaction and association of −CH3 groups of DMSO.
Moreover, they have suggested that the anomaly at χDMSO ∼ 0.12–0.15 arises due to percolation-like transition.78 The normalized fluorescence upconversion traces
and the corresponding decay parameters of BP(OH)2 in DMSO–water
binary mixtures are shown in Figure 4d and Table S3, respectively.
For the DMSO–water binary mixture, the anomalous behavior in
τfast values is found in ranges χDMSO = 0.12–0.16 and χDMSO = 0.26–0.34,
where the τfast values are in ranges ∼4 and
14–25 ps, respectively, and are shown in Figure 5d. However, beyond χDMSO = 0.40, we have found a decay component instead of a growth component
in the fluorescence upconversion trace; this suggests that PT may
occur in a single step instead of two-step pathway, i.e., no MK tautomer
formation. In the χDMSO = 0.12–0.16 region,
there is not much change (τfast ∼ 4 ps) in
the proton transfer (PT) dynamics. Therefore, in this region, proton
transfer dynamics is insensitive toward the mole fraction of DMSO
and anomaly is present in the χDMSO = 0.12–0.16
region.46 The anomaly of the χDMSO = 0.26–0.34 region is due to the enhanced viscosity
of the medium71 because of a stoichiometrically
well defined complex formation between water and DMSO, as reported
by García-Blanco and co-workers.55

2.3.1.5 Comparative Discussion of the Binary Mixtures
Our group has reported that with an increase in the mole fraction
of alcohols (χEtOH and χTBA) the
viscosity (η) of the solution increases and reaches maxima for
χEtOH = 0.23 (η = 2.55 cP) and χTBA = 0.43 (η = 5.32 cP) and with further alcohol addition
the viscosity of the medium decreases.52 Similarly, we have obtained another anomalous region at χEtOH = 0.23–0.28 and χTBA = 0.40–0.46,
which is quite matching with the regions of the maximum shear viscosity
of the medium. Therefore, the retardation in the PT dynamics in this
region can be due to the increased shear viscosity of the medium.
Recently, our group52 and Pradhan et al.45 have shown that for the ethanol–water
mixture the anomalous region is present at χEtOH ∼
0.20–0.25, where the tetrahedral hydrogen-bonding network structure
of water gradually transforms to a chainlike alcohol structure. In
this ESIDPT study of BP(OH)2, we have obtained those two
anomalous regions as χEtOH = 0.23–0.28 and
χTBA = 0.40–0.46. Unlike that for TBA–water
and n-propanol–water binary mixtures, the
hydrophobic contribution is less for ethanol–water and hence
the possibility of a stable water cage structure around the ethanol
molecule is also less, which results in a less pronounced effect of
heterogeneity for ethanol–water compared to that for other
two mixtures. Therefore, the deviation from ideality for the alcohol–water
system follows the same trend as that of the hydrophobic contribution
of the alkyl chains of alcohols. The hydrophobicity is maximum for
TBA–water, whereas it is minimum for ethanol–water and
intermediate for n-propanol–water, and this
same trend is reflected in the anomalous PT dynamics of BP(OH)2 in alcohol–water binary mixtures. In going from ethanol
to TBA, the alkyl chain length of the alcohols increases, i.e., hydrophobicity
increases, and to solubilize the alcohols completely in water, greater
number of water molecules have to be involved in cluster formation;
as a result, the number of free water molecules decreases and as the
proton transfer (PT) dynamics of BP(OH)2 follows the intermolecular
water-mediated pathway, its dynamics is also slowed down. We have
obtained the anomalous slowdown in PT dynamics in ranges χEtOH = 0.04–0.07, χEtOH = 0.23–0.28,
χPrOH = 0.17–0.30, χTBA =
0.12–0.21, and χTBA = 0.40–0.46.

The main reason behind the inclusion of DMSO in this study is the
observation of the decay component instead of the growth component
in the femtosecond upconversion traces, i.e., the contribution corresponding
to τfast is positive instead of negative beyond χDMSO = 0.40. Generally, the growth component for PT dynamics
of BP(OH)2 denotes that PT is occurring in a two-step pathway
and the decay component indicates the concerted pathway.21,26 Here, we have observed the growth component up to χDMSO = 0.40 and after that no growth component is found. Therefore, similar
to that in the alcohol–water binary mixture, PT is taking place
in a two-step pathway via a water network up to χDMSO = 0.40. However, the absence of growth component for χDMSO > 0.40 may be due to the change of the PT mechanism
from
a two-step to a concerted intramolecular PT pathway. Hazra and co-workers
have reported a similar concerted PT pathway of BP(OH)2 in cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) confined media.26 From the simulation study, Bagchi and co-workers have reported that
the stability order of the microheterogeneous aggregates with respect
to lifetime follows the following order: ethanol–water <
DMSO–water < TBA–water.40 The emission maximum of the MK form of BP(OH)2 for χTBA = 0.03 is obtained at ∼ 503 nm by exciting the sample
at λex = 380 nm and at time 1 ps (as the time scale
of the growth component is ∼6.4 ps (Table 1)) in the femtosecond fluorescence upconversion
instrument and is shown in Figure S9.

The lifetime of the DK form of BP(OH)2 in noninteracting
and nonpolar solvent cyclohexane is ∼3.10 ns. Alcohols are
polar protic molecules and prone to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds
with the DK form and thus break down their intramolecular hydrogen
bonds, which distorts their planar structure, resulting in an enhancement
of the nonradiative rate and subsequent reduction of the fluorescence
lifetime of the DK form. Unlike water, alcohols have weak association
properties with the DK tautomer of BP(OH)2 and therefore
alcohols are unable to produce any solvent network or solvent chain,
which can solvate both the proton donor and the acceptor centers of
the probe. Compared with other two alcohols, ethanol can interact
strongly with BP(OH)2, and its fluorescence lifetime reduces
to ∼2 ns. The average fluorescence lifetime of the DK tautomer
in neat DMSO is ∼340 ps, and this significant amount of decrease
compared to that in a nonpolar solvent, cyclohexane (∼3.10
ns), infers the strong interaction between the polar head group of
DMSO and the cationic head group of the DK tautomer, resulting in
significant nonradiative decay.

In our study, at different mole
fractions of alcohol or DMSO in
the mixture, there is a change in the number of water molecules, and
it reflects in the fluorescence lifetime of the DK tautomer. For all
of the four binary mixtures, in the initial mole fraction regions,
water availability is very high and thus the lifetime of the DK form
is short. With a further increment of the mole fraction of alcohol
or DMSO, the lifetime values have increased for all of the binary
mixtures. We have also mentioned that because of cluster formation
at certain mole fractions of binary mixtures water availability decreases
and the lifetime of the DK tautomer of BP(OH)2 increases.
We have observed the increase in the lifetime of the DK tautomer of
BP(OH)2 for χEtOH = 0.28, 0.30; χPrOH = 0.17, 0.20; χTBA = 0.43; and χDMSO = 0.11–0.14.

Zied has reported that in aqueous
medium along with the intramolecular
PT mechanism another photoinduced intermolecular PT mechanism can
take place via a water network where the water molecules solvate each
of the two hydrogen-bonding centers of BP(OH)2.10 Moreover, this study reveals that possibly BP(OH)2 can act as a suitable water sensor in a biological system
and inside macromolecules. The results obtained in different binary
mixtures further shed light on the importance of water network in
the PT mechanism.29 Polar protic molecule
water can simultaneously act as a proton donor and an acceptor; that
is, it can receive proton from the donor site of the probe molecule
and can transfer a different proton to the acceptor site of the probe.
Literature reports suggest that this type of water-mediated PT significantly
lowers the free energy barrier of the PT reaction.80,81 PT through a water network is very significant in biology and frequently
happens in protein systems.82,83 Markova et al. have
performed the computational study and proposed that solvent molecules
can control the PT dynamics via specific short-range hydrogen-bonding
interactions where a limited number of solvent molecules can affect
the entire reaction path by their direct participation in the PT reaction
and thus the energy barrier is lowered.80 The adiabatic time-dependent density functional theory calculations
also suggest that the activation energy barrier for the phototautomerization
reaction is dramatically reduced as the water molecules form a bridge
and connect the proton donor and acceptor pair to facilitate the cooperative
migration of protons.81 The stabilization
of the tautomers of BP(OH)2 through the water network is
shown in Scheme 2.10

Scheme 2 Two Possible Proton Transfer Pathways of
BP(OH)2 in Water
The importance of water as a PT carrier and its influence
on the
reaction barrier have been extensively studied both theoretically84−87 and experimentally.28,86,87 Zied has studied the photophysics of BP(OH)2 in p-dioxane/water binary mixtures and proposed that three
water molecules are needed to solvate each of the hydrogen-bonding
centers of BP(OH)2.29 Abou-Zied10 has proposed that in mechanism I water molecules
interact with each polar part of BP(OH)2 and subsequently
lead to deprotonation of enol and protonation of imine to form a DK
form. This DK tautomer is stabilized in the ground state as well as
in the excited state by the interaction of water with each polar part
of BP(OH)2. In the second mechanism, the involvement of
water network between the two prototropic centers of the DE tautomer
in the ground state is shown. This solvation mechanism is quite different
from the other one and produces the DK tautomer in the excited state
by a cooperative PT through a water wire pathway. This water network
between the two hydrogen-bonding centers restricts the rotation of
the two aromatic rings of the DK form around the central single bond.
Purkayastha and co-workers have reported that this type of water-mediated,
unconventional DPT mechanism dominates when limited number of water
molecules are available surrounding the fluorophore.88 Datta and co-workers have also revealed the importance
of water in the PT dynamics of BP(OH)2 inside the nafion
membrane.28

In this study, we have
found that PT dynamics from a MK to a DK
form is slowed down in the anomalous regions of the alcohol–water
binary mixtures. It is already discussed that in those regions cluster
formation takes place and the water molecules are strongly involved
in the clusters. As a result, water molecules are less available around
the BP(OH)2 probe and the above-mentioned second mechanism
of PT is dominant here. This mechanism requires the involvement of
water network for facile PT, and as the accessibility of water molecules
is reduced due to cluster formation, as a consequence, PT dynamics
is also hindered.

In Scheme 2, it
is shown that PT can take place following the intramolecular pathway
(mechanism I) as well as the intermolecular route through a water
network (mechanism II). We do not find any rise component beyond χDMSO = 0.40, and this indicates that no MK form is generating
and double proton transfer (DPT) is taking place directly from the
DE to DK forms. However, beyond χDMSO = 0.40, the
mechanism may be either intramolecular or water-assisted intermolecular
PT. Zied et al.10 have shown that in mechanism
II (i.e., intermolecular pathway), due to the strong solvation of
the polar groups by a water wire at each hydrogen-bonding center,
the DK tautomer has a restricted rotation around the central bond
between the two aromatic rings. After the biexponential fitting of
the fluorescence decay curve, the lifetime of the longer component
of this tautomer appears as 5.40 ns. Our group has also studied the
photophysical behavior of BP(OH)2 in DMSO–water
and fitted all of the decays using a single exponential function having
the lifetime in the 0.4–0.8 ns range, and for χDMSO ≥ 0.8, a biexponential fitting equation is used. Although
the longer component has the lifetime ∼3 ns, its contribution
is very less (∼1%).30 In this study
also, the slower component has the lifetime ∼0.34–0.67
ns and the absence of any longer component having lifetime ∼5
ns rules out the possibility of the intermolecular pathway. Moreover,
in the UV–visible absorption spectra of BP(OH)2,
in the higher mole fraction region of DMSO, there is no signature
of absorption band ∼400–450 nm, and this additionally
excludes the involvement of water in the intermolecular PT pathway.
Therefore after χDMSO = 0.40, concerted and intramolecular
PT is taking place.

2.3.2 Femtosecond Fluorescence
Anisotropy Measurement
Time-resolved anisotropy measurements
reveal the quantitative information
about the reorientation dynamics of the fluorophore and the extent
of rigidity, microheterogeneity, and hydrophobicity of the microenvironment
around the probe molecules. The excited-state potential energy surface
is asymmetric in shape and therefore the electronic part of the molecular
wave function can vary significantly during the ESIDPT process. Thus,
the PT dynamics of photoexcited BP(OH)2 can provide ultrafast
temporal components in fluorescence anisotropy.89,90 We can detect this dynamics employing a sensitive femtosecond fluorescence
upconversion technique. The anisotropy decays are adequately fitted
by a biexponential function. The faster component is related to the
second step of sequential PT, i.e., MK to DK tautomer formation, and
the relatively slower component is due to the rotational diffusion
motion of the DK form of BP(OH)2 in the medium.16

Femtosecond fluorescence anisotropy decays
of BP(OH)2 in ethanol–water and n-propanol–water binary mixtures are shown in Figure 6a,b, respectively, and the
corresponding decay parameters are tabulated in Tables S4 and S5, respectively. We have observed that the
average rotational time of BP(OH)2 is not much changing
with the change in the mole fraction of ethanol and shows a maximum
at χEtOH = 0.30, where the average rotational time
is ∼55 ps. For the n-propanol–water
binary mixture, the change in the average rotational time of BP(OH)2 is relatively more prominent and shows a maximum value of
∼71 ps at χPrOH = 0.17. On the other hand,
the TBA–water binary mixture shows a comparatively higher change
in the average rotational time for different mole fractions, the rotational
motion of the probe is relatively slowed down at regions χTBA = 0.12–0.15 and χTBA = 0.40–0.46,
and the average rotational time is ∼88–95 ps and is
shown in Figure 6c
and Table S6. However, from this much change
in the average rotational time, we cannot conclude these two regions
as the anomalous regions. A change in the average rotational time
of BP(OH)2 upon varying the shear viscosity of the TBA–water
binary mixture is shown in Figure 7. The shear viscosity of the TBA–water binary
mixture at different mole fractions is reported in our previous report.52 Therefore, similar to the PT dynamics, increase
in microheterogeneity, cluster formation, and shear viscosity are
responsible for the above observation of relative slowdown of the
anisotropy decay. Femtosecond fluorescence anisotropy decays of BP(OH)2 in the DMSO–water binary mixture are shown in Figure 6d, and the corresponding
decay parameters are tabulated in Table S7. The average rotational time is slowed down for χDMSO = 0.20 and χDMSO = 0.30–0.34, and the values
are ∼70 ps and 80–85 ps, respectively.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion,
we have shown nonideal changes in the photophysical
properties and proton transfer (PT) dynamics of BP(OH)2 in ethanol–water, n-propanol–water, tert-butyl alcohol (TBA)–water, and DMSO–water
binary mixtures. The fluorescence quantum yield measurement provides
an initial idea about the anomalous behavior of BP(OH)2 in these four binary mixtures. The femtosecond fluorescence upconversion
measurement provides that PT from the MK to the DK tautomer is unusually
slowed down for the alcohol mole fractions χEtOH =
0.04–0.07, χEtOH = 0.23–0.28, χPrOH = 0.17–0.30, χTBA = 0.12–0.21,
and χTBA = 0.40–0.46 and for DMSO–water
ranges χDMSO = 0.12–0.16 and χDMSO = 0.26–0.34. Moreover, this sluggish kinetics is much more
for the TBA–water mixture compared to that for the other two
mixtures. With the increase in alkyl chain length (ethanol to TBA),
the hydrophobic contribution of the alcohol enhances, which further
results in the increased microheterogeneity of the binary mixture.
Therefore, TBA–water forms the most stable cluster and the
water molecules are strongly engaged; thus, the water molecules are
less available for water-mediated PT dynamics and exhibit the hindered
PT in the anomalous regions of the binary mixture. However, most interestingly,
beyond χDMSO = 0.40, the growth component of the
femtosecond upconverted trace disappears and this may be due to the
change of water-mediated two-step PT mechanism to a concerted intramolecular
pathway.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
[2,2′-Bipyridyl]-3,3′-diol,
(BP(OH)2) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as
received without further purification. Spectroscopy-grade DMSO, ethanol, n-propanol, and tert-butyl alcohol (TBA)
were obtained from Spectrochem Pvt. Ltd., India, and distilled before
use. Triple-distilled Milli-Q water was used to prepare all of the
solutions of TBA–water, ethanol–water, n-propanol–water, and DMSO–water binary mixtures.

4.2 Sample Preparation
We prepared a
stock solution of BP(OH)2 in methanol. Stock solutions
of ethanol, n-propanol, TBA, and DMSO were taken
separately in different volumetric flasks, and the solutions were
kept at room temperature for 1 day before use. Thereafter, BP(OH)2 was taken in an eppendorf, and after complete evaporation
of the solvent, required volumes of alcohol or DMSO and water were
added to prepare binary mixture solutions of different mole fractions.

4.3 Instrumentation
The steady-state
absorption and emission spectra of BP(OH)2 in three alcohol
(ethanol, n-propanol, TBA)–water and DMSO–water
binary mixtures are recorded using a Shimadzu (model no UV-2450) spectrophotometer
and Hitachi (model no. F-7000) spectrofluorimeter, respectively.

Femtosecond fluorescence traces are taken in our femtosecond fluorescence
upconversion setup where the excitation source is a solid-state Ti–sapphire
laser (Mai Tai HP, Spectra-Physics) with a tunable range from 690
to 1040 nm. In our experiment, we have used ∼100 fs pulse centered
at 760 nm with a repetition rate of 80 MHz. Our experimental setup
is commercially available from IB photonics, model Fluomax-SC (Bulgaria).
In this setup, a fundamental 760 nm beam is focused onto a thin β-barium
borate (BBO) crystal, which generates a frequency-doubled visible
pump beam centered at 380 nm. The remaining fundamental beam, which
acts as a gate beam and frequency-doubled 380 nm beam, is separated
through a dichroic mirror. The fluorescence is collected from the
sample and focused on another thin BBO crystal for type I frequency
upconversion with the fundamental gate pulse. The gate pulse is time-delayed
with respect to the fluorescence using a computer-controlled motorized
optical delay line. The upconverted signal is focused on the entrance
slit of a double monochromator and detected by a photomultiplier tube
(Hamamatsu). All of the emission decays are collected in magic angle
(54.7°) polarization. Throughout the experiment, we have used
∼10 mW power of the pump laser to excite the sample, taken
in a rotating sample holder. Our instrument response function (IRF)
is estimated around ∼250 fs. The femtosecond fluorescence kinetics
is taken at the respective emission maxima and deconvoluted using
a Gaussian-shaped IRF by Labview software using a multiexponential
function, , where ai(λ)
is the contribution of corresponding τi(λ) decay times. For anisotropy measurements, a polarizer is
placed in the excitation path and the parallel (I∥) and perpendicular (I⊥) components of the fluorescence decays are collected for the same
acquisition time.

The following equation is used to calculate
the time-resolved anisotropy,
(r(t)) 1  The correction factor, G,
has been calculated using horizontally polarized excitation light.
The horizontal (I∥) and vertical
(I⊥) components of the emission
decay are collected through the emission monochromator when the emission
polarizer is fixed at horizontal and vertical positions, respectively.
In our setup, the G value is 0.97. During the analysis
of femtosecond fluorescence decays, we have used Labview software.
We have performed the steady-state absorption measurement for each
sample before and after each femtosecond fluorescence upconversion
measurement, and the absorption spectra remain unaltered, which discards
the possibility of photodegradation of the samples.

The block
diagram of the femtosecond fluorescence upconversion
setup is shown in Scheme S1.

To determine
the fluorescence quantum yield of BP(OH)2 in ethanol–water, n-propanol–water,
TBA–water, and DMSO–water binary mixtures, we have used
anthracene (λex = 345 nm) as the reference whose
quantum yield is 0.27 in ethanol at 25 °C. The following equation
is used for the calculation of quantum yield of BP(OH)2 at different mole fractions in different binary mixtures. 2  Φ, Abs, and A denote
the quantum yield, absorbance, and area under the fluorescence curve,
respectively, whereas n denotes the refractive index
of the medium. Subscripts S and R represent the corresponding parameters
for the sample and reference, respectively.
