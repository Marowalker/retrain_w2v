This
work tackles the disadvantages in the production of functionalized
nanofibers from biomass and offers a new methodology to nanofiber-reinforced
composite manufacturing. A vapor-phase-assisted surface polymerization
(VASP) method has been used to develop surface-modified lignocellulosic
nanofibers. Through the vaporized monomers during polymerization,
the polymer chains can be introduced deep within oil palm mesocarp
fibers (OPMFs) due to their unique porous structure. After OPMFs are
modified with polymer chains, the simple Mortar grinder mill–ionic
liquid (M-IL) method provides fibrillation from the macro- to nanoscale,
retaining the grafted polymer chains. This approach for the functionalization
of biomass could lead to the large-scale fabrication of surface-modified
nanofibers for reinforced materials and promote innovative implementations
of the renewable biomass resource.

==== Body
1 Introduction
In
the field of materials, biomass has commercial importance and
is regarded as a value-added additive.1 The interest in nanofibers from biomass has been gradually increasing
worldwide due to their large specific surface areas.2 The nanofibers act as a fortification substance by increasing
the strength and stiffness, as well as decreasing the weight of the
resulting composites.3 Until biomass turns
into nanofiller for the composite, the basic methodology followed
by researchers consists of the production of nanofibers from biomass
first and then the surface modification of the fibers to avoid agglomeration
in a nonpolar polymer matrix.4−7 Despite vast efforts in this two-stage process, limitations
that restrict widespread applications and large-scale manufacturing
still build barriers between the composite industry and nanofibers.
Moreover, although one of the main reasons to utilize nanofibers as
filler is to manufacture eco-friendly composites, the methods commonly
used to produce nanofibers are not eco-friendly and require harmful
chemicals and a high amount of solvents and time. On the other hand,
functionalization of nanofibers also suffers many problems, such as
the need for multiple steps, the use of large volumes of organic solvents
where nanofibers do not disperse homogeneously, and the low yield
of modified fiber.8

The vapor-phase-assisted
surface polymerization (VASP) method has
been developed to coat many substrate surfaces with polymers, resulting
in the conspicuous achievements of control over hydrophobic/hydrophilic
properties and surface grafting.9−16 The VASP process is an excellent method for preserving the delicate
surfaces of materials.17 The polymerization
is a solvent-free method, takes place by gas–solid interface
interaction, and provides higher grafting rate when compared with
the commonly used liquid processes. These benefits make this method
appealing to the surface modification of nanofibers.

In modern
society, the utilization of biomass as nanofillers in
producing advanced materials needs alternative methods with new concepts
that could facilitate the processing steps and minimize the use of
chemicals. We propose to fulfill these two requirements by combining
the oil palm mesocarp fiber (OPMF), a biomass resource with porous
structure,18 grafted with polycaprolactone
(PCL) chains inside the fibers through vaporized monomer molecules,
and the Mortar grinder mill-ionic liquid (M-IL) method that was reported
as an effective one-step fibrillation procedure in our previous study.19 Herein, as opposed to the conventional methodology
order employed to produce functionalized nanofibers, for the first
time in this study, we demonstrate that the fibrillation can be done
using functionalized microsize lignocellulose via VASP and yield functional
nanoscale materials that have hydrophobic property.

2 Results and Discussion
VASP of ε-caprolactone was
carried out in a H-shaped glass
tube reactor on pulverized OPMF. The product, which was named [OPMF-VASP],
was similar to a solid layer after the polymerization. On the basis
of the increaseed weight of the product over a 24 h period, its composition
was estimated to be: fiber 22% and polymer 78%. Afterward, [OPMF-VASP]
was treated with a combination method of M-IL to fibrillate the grafted
fibers and was called [OPMF-VASP]-M-IL. A schematic illustration of
the preparation of functionalized nanofibers is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Schematic diagram of
the preparation of [OPMF-VASP]-M-IL.

The changes in the UV/RI intensity ratio of each fraction
in size
exclusion chromatography (SEC) profiles of the synthesized PCL (Mw 12 000) and the samples, [OPMF-VASP]
and [OPMF-VASP]-M-IL, were exhibited in Figure 2. It was found that there is an increment
in the UV/RI ratio value of the [OPMF-VASP] sample (Table S1, Supporting Information). In addition, FT-IR results
of [OPMF-VASP] and [OPMF-VASP]-M-IL after extraction showed that the
peak intensity of the −OH groups associated with the OPMF components
marginally declined in comparison to that of OPMF (Figure S1, Supporting Information). This result indicates
that some OPMF components, such as lignin, were grafted to PCL via
covalent bonding. When the combined treatment method of a mortar grinder
mill and ionic liquid was employed for the [OPMF-VASP] sample, the
treatment led to no change in the PCL-grafted components, revealing
the grafted PCL is retained. Moreover, [OPMF-VASP] indicated an increase
in the intensity of the PCL carbonyl group peak at 1722 cm–1, whereas the hydroxyl peak of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin
at 3000–3600 cm–1 decreased in comparison
to that of OPMF. Another decrease in the peak of C–O–(H)
stretching at 1035 cm–1 also proved that the grafting
of PCL successfully took place on −OH groups of hemicellulose
and/or lignin chains. Furthermore, it was also found that no significant
differences occurred between the [OPMF-VASP]-M-IL and [OPMF-VASP]
samples after the M-IL treatment, showing that the combined treatment
did not destroy the grafted PCL chains of OPMF.

Figure 2 SEC profiles of UV/RI
intensity ratios of synthesized PCL (a),
[OPMF-VASP] (b), and [OPMF-VASP]-M-IL (c).

In addition, Figure S2 illustrates
the
proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra of extracted
materials of [OPMF-VASP] and [OPMF-VASP]-M-IL when compared to the
commercial PCL in order to confirm the formation of the PCL grafting.
The same peaks that were found in the commercial PCL were observed
in the [OPMF-VASP] sample, apart from 1.24 ppm. This alteration may
be attributed to the formation of specific interactions between the
fibers and PCL. Furthermore, the characteristic peaks of the commercial
PCL were observed in the spectra of [OPMF-VASP]-M-IL, indicating that
the M-IL treatment did not cause structural changes on the covalent
bonded PCL chains. The additional peaks, perhaps revealing the dissolution
of some PCL-grafted components, also remained unaffected. This finding
is consistent with the results obtained from FT-IR.

The alteration
in the morphology of OPMF was examined by SEM observation. Figure S3a shows the porous structure of OPMF.
In Figure S3b, the inset presents the fractured
view of the block product, where all the fibers were embedded in PCL
after polymerization. On the fractured surface, the marks of interior
surface of the fiber were seen, proving that the polymerization occurred
for the interior surface of the fiber as well as its external surface.
Obviously, after M-IL treatment, the block product of [OPMF-VASP]
was pulverized as shown in Figure S3c.
The pulverized particles represent that the produced nanofibers were
coated and embedded with PCL. In order to confirm the fibrillation,
the fractured surface of the PCL composite prepared with 5 wt % [OPMF-VASP]-M-IL
loading was observed (Figure S3d, Supporting Information). It was found that the fibers coated with PCL were homogeneously
dispersed in the composite matrix. This result is important proof
that shows that surface modification of the fibers was done successfully.
Size distribution of [OPMF-VASP] before and after the combined treatment
was measured through dynamic light scattering (DLS) in Figure 3. The samples were dissolved
in toluene and measured at a concentration of 1.03 mg/mL. The measurement
of [OPMF-VASP] demonstrated a wide range of size distribution with
16 μm of average diameter. A significant shift to smaller diameters
in the size distribution of [OPMF-VASP]-M-IL clearly occurred. This
might be due to the fibrillation of the PCL grafted OPMF by mortar
grinding, accompanied by the decrease of fiber diameter. In our previous
study, we reported that the combination treatment (M-IL) on OPMF also
alters the fiber diameter (127 nm), and when ionic liquid dissolves
some components of OPMF, the magnetic grinder pulverizes the fiber
at the same time.19 Here, in the case of
treatment of [OPMF-VASP], it was reported that the same pulverization
effect of the magnetic grinder on the grafted OPMF fibers also provided
fibrillation (105 nm). It was expected that the agglomeration of the
product particles was inhibited during the wet mortar grinding in
the presence of ionic liquid when compared to dry mortar grinding,20 since the ionic liquid, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
fluoroborate ([BMIM][BF4]), facilitates to break down the possible
hydrogen bonding among the grafted lignocellulosic components through
its poorly coordinated ions. In addition to this, [OPMF-VASP] and
[OPMF-VASP]-M-IL were added to chloroform to investigate their dispersion
in the organic solvent that PCL can dissolve. The photographs taken
before and after 1 h indicate the presence of nanosized fibers after
M-IL treatment. It shows a proof of surface modification for nanosized
fibers through the VASP method, supporting the DLS results (Figure 4).

[OPMF-VASP]-M-IL (b).

Thermogravimetric analysis (TG/DTG) profiles of pulverized
OPMF,
[OPMF-VASP], and [OPMF-VASP]-M-IL were displayed in Figure 5 to investigate not only the
effect of the grafting of PCL on thermal stability of the OPMF but
also the effect of M-IL treatment on [OPMF-VASP]-M-IL. It was found
that the value of Td50% of the synthesized
PCL was 302 °C, while that of pulverized OPMF was 337 °C.
It was clearly observed that the grafted PCL led to a decrease in
the thermal stability of [OPMF-VASP] (329 °C). In the DTG curve,
the temperature region of 230–320 °C was assigned to the
degradation region of a hemicellulose component in the material.21 Interestingly, the hemicellulose degradation
peak of [OPMF-VASP]-M-IL was decreased. This might be explained by
the removal of some hemicellulose components during the M-IL treatment.
The residual weight difference between [OPMF-VASP] and [OPMF-VASP]-M-IL
is also another evidence that reveals the removal of hemicellulose
partially from [OPMF-VASP]-M-IL. Therefore, no remarkable difference
in the thermal stability of [OPMF-VASP]-M-IL (326 °C) was seen
in comparison to [OPMF-VASP]. This result proved that M-IL treatment
did not significantly affect the grafted PCL chains on the fibers.

and DTG (b) profiles of the synthesized PCL, OPMF, [OPMF-VASP],
and [OPMF-VASP]-M-IL.

In Figure 6, the
Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of ionic liquid residue
which was collected after the M-IL treatment of [OPMF-VASP]-M-IL was
compared to commercial [BMIM][BF4] ionic liquid. It was
observed that it is similar to the spectrum of pure commercial ionic
liquid, except for one small extra peak at 1724 cm–1 which belongs to the carbonyl group (C=O). This extra peak
may be due to the presence of hemicellulose dissolved in ionic liquid.
This finding confirms the results obtained from TGA and DTG. Since
the FT-IR spectrum confirms that the chemical structure of [BMIM][BF4] remains roughly unchanged during the treatment, it might
give an opportunity to reuse the same ionic liquid.

3 Conclusions
This
paper preliminarily shows the possibility for fibrillation
of surface-modified lignocellulose consisting of nanofibers grafted
with a hydrophobic polymeric matrix such as PCL. The applicable method
to an industrial scale reported in this study avoids the conventional
fibrillation methods that require hazardous solvents and eliminates
problems which are faced during functionalization of the nanofibers.
It should be emphasized that this work builds bridges between two
very important research areas related to green chemistry and biomass-based
materials. On one hand, the used polymerization approach is closely
associated with recent environmentally friendly activities and efforts
developed in the field of nanobiomass-based materials. On the other
hand, when we perform a chemical modification on biomass and after
fibrillation, we bring a new aspect into methodology. A detailed study
on the surface-modified nanofiber should be investigated to reveal
the potential use of different types of polymers.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Monomer,
ε-caprolactone
(>99.0%), was purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry (Tokyo, Japan).
It was dried over calcium hydride (CaH2) (Wako Pure Chemical
Industry, Osaka, Japan) and distilled under nitrogen at reduced pressure.
Butanol and tin(II) 2-ethylhexanoate (Sn(Oct)2) were obtained
from Wako Pure Chemical Industry. Oil palm mesocarp fiber (OPMF) used
in this study was obtained from FELDA Serting Hilir Palm Oil Mill,
Negeri Sembilan in Malaysia. OPMF was milled using a disc mill (PM-2500M,
Osaka Chemical Co., Japan) and sieved (MVS-1N, AS-ONE, Japan) to separate
fibers with particle size less than 63 μm, then stored at room
temperature in an aluminum bag before use. The ionic liquid, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
fluoroborate [BMIM][BF4] (98%), and all the solvents were
purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industry. In order to produce a
reference polymer, the bulk polymerization of ε-caprolactone
(11.6 mmol) was performed, in the presence of butanol (0.35 mmol,
initiator) and Sn(Oct)2 (0.06 mmol, catalyst), at 75 °C
for 18 h [(Mw = 12 000) calculated
by SEC]. Commercial polycaprolactone (PCL) [number-average of molecular
weight, Mn = 80 000] was received
in pellet form from Sigma-Aldrich.

4.2 Typical
Procedure of VASP
Pulverized
OPMF (0.2 g) was used as a substrate for VASP, and 0.32 mmol of Sn(Oct)2 was dissolved in 5 mL of acetone. The solution was then mixed
with OPMF at room temperature to be absorbed. After it dried under
ambient atmosphere, the remaining solvent was removed under vacuum
at room temperature. A typical procedure of VASP was done in an H-shaped
glass tube reactor with a vacuum cock. The catalyst-supported OPMF
was put into a Petri dish, of 4.40 cm2 bottom surface area,
and then the Petri dish was settled at the bottom of one of the legs
of the H-shaped glass tube reactor. Purified ε-caprolactone
(13.5 mmol) was introduced to the bottom of the other leg. The reactor
was then degassed by three freeze–pump–thaw cycles and
sealed at last. Polymerization was carried out at 70 °C for 24
h in a thermostatic oven. After VASP, the obtained sample was dried
to remove unreactants in vacuo and weighted to calculate
the weight increment (0.92 g) of the [OPMF-VASP] composite (Table S1).

4.3 Treatment
of [OPMF-VASP] Using [BMIM][BF4]
[OPMF-VASP] (1
g) was grinded with 3 mL of [BMIM][BF4] at room temperature
for 3 h using a magnetic pestle device
(MMPS-T1, AS-ONE, Japan). After the treatment, [OPMF-VASP]-M-IL was
washed with ethyl alcohol and centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 20 min (ST
8R, Thermo Scientific, USA).

4.4 Characterization
FT-IR measurements
were conducted using a PerkinElmer Spectrum GX Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectrometer. The samples were ground and pelletized using
potassium bromide (KBr). The spectra were recorded in the range of
3700–900 cm–1 and 16 scans per sample. 1H NMR spectra of the samples were recorded in a 500 MHz JEOL
JNM-ECP500 FT-NMR spectrometer in chloroform-d at
room temperature, and the chemical shifts were reported as δ
values (ppm) relative to internal tetramethylsilane (TMS). Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) was performed using an EXSTAR TG/DTG7000 (SII Nanotechnology
Inc., Japan). Approximately 7 mg of sample was placed in an aluminum
pan and heated to 550 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min under nitrogen
flow (100 mL/min). The particle size distribution was examined by
a dynamic light scattering (DLS) (DelsaMax Pro, Beckman Coulter, USA).
Measurements were performed at a concentration of 1.03 mg/mL in toluene
at 25 °C. Each value was obtained using the average of three
measurements. Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) measurements of
the weight-average molecular weight (Mw) and polydispersity index (Mw/Mn) of the polymers obtained after VASP were
conducted on a TOSOH HLC-8320 size exclusion chromatograph (Tokyo,
Japan) (TSKgel Super HM-H linear column; linearity range, 1 ×
103–8 × 106; molecular weight exclusion
limit, 4 × 108) using polystyrene as the standard.
Polymers were extracted by dissolving in CHCl3 (5 mg/mL).
After the dissolution, the solutions were filtered through a membrane
filter with 0.45 μm pore size and then measured at a flow of
0.6 mL/min at 40 °C. Mw and Mw/Mn were calculated
from the SEC curve using EcoSEC-WS software.
